How'd Coach take it? About as well as he took the breakup. It's been months. He's still whining? Dating my coach from the start was a bad idea. It doesn't matter. It's your choice. Besides, there's more important things to life than swimming. Like us. Babe. Babe, we're okay. Okay, you're a swimmer, I'm a lifeguard. We're fine. It's not the water I'm worried about. It's... Liz, come on. You didn't know him like I did. He was always so controlling, obsessive even. As a coach or a boyfriend? Both. Well, that's why I picked this place. No one's ever here. We're all alone and no psycho ex-boyfriends are gonna bother you, okay? I promise. I guess you won't be needing this anymore. Guess not. It's all in the past now. Oh my God! Oh my God, something bit you! No, that's not a bite! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson! Tyson, where are you? Tyson! Tyson! Careful getting back in the water. Those Satanic Surfers are the strongest drinks we make. Thank you. Enjoy. Normal bosses would be mad at an employee for doing personal projects while at work. But you're not a normal boss, AJ. Damn right I'm not. You know, and I've told you this before, but people would buy these, Maggie, I know it. It's still just a hobby. I'm not a real artist... yet. Could have fooled me. By the way, most employees would be mad at their boss for being late to work, cutting into their lunch break. Sorry, Maggie. I was on a date. In the morning? Well, actually the date was last night. It just carried over... Ugh, TMI. No. So what's going on? You have a lunch with your super-famous influencer boyfriend? Not today. I have other plans. It's time. Keep it up, bud. Weight's coming off. All right. Surfboard. Finally going back out, huh? Careful. And I completely agree. Whoever is the 1,000th like will receive a personalized video message from me. I'd like a personalized message from you. And lunch, Cade. I know, Tina, I know. Just give me a couple more minutes, please. You know, you say that all the time, and then we're here another 30 minutes. I got you, I got you, okay? Hey, you're safe, okay? Breathe, just breathe. Guys, back up, give her some air. Come on, I'm starving. All guards report, please. We have a 10-10 in Sector Four. - All guards report, please. - Oh my God. In Sector Four. - What happened? - You're okay? Your knee, it must have spasmed. - I didn't see you come up... - Maggie! - So I had to go in there... - Maggie! - It's okay, I got her. I got... - It's my girlfriend. All right, all right. Hi, it's okay. It's all right. You're gonna be okay, okay, baby? Lifeguard headquarters. How can I help you? One moment, please. - Maggie. - I know. You do? You could have drowned. I've told you a thousand times and so has your doctor, - your knee isn't ready... - Can we not do this right now? Uh, hey, uh... I'm fine, Tina. Well, how 'bout you? I'm just glad she's okay. Well, let me know if you need anything. Could it be any more obvious? Maggie. And she comments on all your posts. A lot of girls comment on my posts. - It's part of my job. - I thought your job was to be a lifeguard. But you're too busy on your damn phone pretending to be a celebrity. Pretending? What would you call 400,000 followers? A waste of time. You never seem to complain when you need help paying your rent. I make three times as much as an influencer than I do as a lifeguard. You know, one day those followers of yours, they won't care anymore and they'll disappear, and you'll be right where you were six months ago. You were depressed and drowning. Ironic choice of words. Maybe if you paid more attention to the real world... Maybe if you listened to people that actually wanted to keep you safe. Hey. New lifeguard. Well, couple of weeks now. I'm Blake. I'm Maggie. Nice to meet you, Maggie. But I do wish it had been under better circumstances. Me too. Well, I guess this is the part where I thank you for saving my life. And this is the part where I tell you I was just doing my job. Could you give us a minute, Cade? Yeah. Thanks. I'll be right outside. Okay. Sorry about him. Hey, no problem. I have heard of the famous Cade Kerrigan. Yeah, the life of an influencer must be stressful, right? I'm just thankful I was in front of your tower. Don't know how I'll ever thank you. You don't have to. Promise. Feel better, Maggie. I, um... I appreciate what you did. But... There's a but. No. Thank you. Hey, you're welcome. I'll see you around. Hey, are you okay? I'm just... gotta get back out there. Before my knee, it was the only place I felt alive. - And if I can't go back... - You'll be back. One day. - But you gotta stop trying... - I know, Cade. Come on, Maggie. You're not focused. You need to find something to do besides surfing. You saying that shows how little you really know me. - I just think... - I will surf again, Cade. Or die trying. Go on. Take it. Your followers are waiting for you. - Maggie. - Just... just go. What's this? It's a gift. I can see that. Okay, does not like surprises. Noted. It's an infrared heat knee massager. Cordless too. See, a couple of years ago, back in Florida, I jacked my knee up jumping off the tower, and I think this would really speed up your rehab. Oh, um, Blake, I... I don't know. Please. It was expensive at the time, so it'd really make me feel better if it got a little use. Okay. Thank you, that's kind. Oh, I wasn't being kind. This is a bribe so I could see you smile. When's your break? Right now. Oh, mine too. Walk? Sure. So, uh, what happened to your knee anyway? Surfing injury. I can hold my own out there, though. Oh, I know. I've seen it. I mean, it's kind of my job to watch the beach and the water, so... Uh-huh. Tore my MCL last year. It's been a slow process, but I'll be back out there soon enough. Hm. What does your doctor say about that? My doctor doesn't know a lot about surfing. But I bet he does know a lot about knees. You sound like Cade. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it to sound like that. So Cade doesn't want you going out there, huh? He means well. He was really supportive when I first got hurt, but then... - Too personal? - Maybe. I don't really know you that well. I mean, you just only saved my life yesterday. True. Look at this. I've been needing this color. For? When I was recovering from surgery, stuck on the couch all day, my doctor thought it would be a good idea to do something creative. That is a good idea. Yeah. I'd never been much of an artist, but I wanted to stay connected to the ocean, so I started making these, I don't know what to call them, seashell collage paintings. That's what folks said you do at AJ's, besides bartending. You stalking me or something? No. I'm kidding. I've actually been trying to get into the Seaside Art Gallery. Unfortunately, Sam, the owner, keeps rejecting them. But I'm gonna try again tomorrow with my newest piece. Okay, well, I'm sure you're gonna impress him. Her. - Her. - And you haven't even seen my work. I know, but... I've seen you surf. The way you push yourself, you're... you're so dedicated. If you put your heart in something like that, then I'm sure you're gonna thrive at it. Thank you. Let me see this. What the hell? Wow, you really found a unique one. Why are you touching her, Blake? What the hell, Cade? He was looking at my shell. I'm sorry. Forget it. My break's over anyways, so I'll see you around, Maggie. Blake... Thank you again for my gift. Anytime. I'm sorry. I just... I thought he was trying to put the moves on you. I... I just reacted. I wasn't... I wasn't thinking. You're right. I think... I think we need some time apart. Oh, please, let's not do this whole "let's take a break" thing. It's so high school. Consider yourself lucky, because I was going to straight-up dump your ass. We the last ones here? Yeah, uh, the boss asked if we could lock up, but I didn't have my key, so... I got mine. Any big plans tonight? Oh yeah, big plans. The beach is closed and a bit late for lifeguarding. - Hey you. - Hey, Maggie. I didn't know you walked this way. Yeah, my place is just a few blocks away. Nice little walk. Good for my knee. This is the new piece. Can I see it? Oh. This is stunning. So you're going to the Seaside Gallery? Yep. I just finished a run. I'll walk you. Okay. So, I tried to find you on social media last night. You're gonna have a hard time. Um, I don't really have any. I just find it's a distraction from the real world. That's, uh, refreshing. You know, you should share your art with the world. It's so unique. That's kind, thank you. Hey. I'm serious. It's not that good. Agree to disagree. I'm nervous. Hey, take a deep breath. I'll be with you. I'll be like your representation. Don't really think I need an agent, but I appreciate your support. Hey, you got this. Yeah. Oh my God. What happened here? Hey. You okay? Good. I'm doing good. Uh, how's Maggie? I wish I knew. Hey. How well do you know this new guy Blake anyways? What, like he's a serial killer or somethin'? I don't trust him. Not with Maggie. Maybe you're jealous. Right. Great. You never told Maggie about us, did you? We've had so many problems lately. I didn't want to upset her over a mistake. Right. A mistake. Tina. Forget it. It was months ago, once. No big deal. Who would do something like this? Someone truly disturbed. Morning, Maggie. Sam, I'm so sorry about your gallery. Oh, my gallery got off easy. No damage to the building. It's just... the artist of this work I feel bad for. I can't even imagine. Another piece for me? Uh, yeah. You told me to bring it by. Oh, that's right, I did. Just like your other work, Maggie. Solid, good, but it's not... Got it. I'll keep working. I mean, do you really think this stuff is that good? Excuse me? It's simple. Kind of boring. Doesn't have anything to do with the sea and... I thought the sign outside said Seaside Gallery. Well, it doesn't mean every art piece we exhibit - has to be a seascape. - Blake. Okay, when do you think you're gonna have the gallery back on its feet again? I don't have another artist scheduled until next month. Probably gonna keep the gallery closed until then. Well, Maggie here, she has enough art to get an exhibit up and running today. I know she does, but Maggie's... Someone new, uniquely talented. And best of all, completely unknown to the local art scene. I mean, this could be like nothing you've ever done in this gallery before. What an opportunity. It takes a lot of manual labor to get an art exhibit up. On it. This place will be spotless. I promise. Oh my God. Congratulations on your first exhibit. I couldn't have gotten it without you. No, no, this was your talent, this was... this was kismet. Don't knock kismet, all right, it's responsible for the start of many great careers. Just don't question it. I can't believe this is happening. Me neither. What's wrong? The last time we were in here... Um... Cade, listen, I, um... Well, we've known each other for a long time. We've always been close. Great friends since, uh, we were rookies. There's something I need to tell you, and I don't want you to think it's because... It's not because I had feelings for you or have feelings for you. I just... I saw something. And I need to tell you. What? What is it? You're old enough to be their dad, creep. Aw, come on. Those girls are your age. Yeah, you're old enough to be my dad. Yeah, I'm like nine years older than you. Whatever, Grandpa. Listen, we have a favor to ask you. "We"? Hey, I'm Blake. Oh, nice to meet you, Blake. Think I've seen you around. Uh, yeah, I work on the beach. Lifeguard. Usually stationed in tower number three. Hey! Spiffy stopwatch! - Maggie! - Come here! - You compete? - Um... Most folks these days have those small ones - that loop on your finger. - Right. Not one of these old-fashioned bad boys. Man! This brings back memories! I used to swim competitively in, uh, high school, back in Florida. You're from Florida too, right? - Yeah. - Well, how about that! I was born in Davenport. But even that was far from the water for me, so I became a Cocoa Beach guy. You? Uh, Daytona. And no, no, never competed. Never even been to Cocoa Beach. - Really? - Yeah. Anyway, what's this favor? The Seaside Gallery wants to exhibit my art. No way! Mag... Maggie, this is so... That's amazing! How did this happen? Um, I guess you could say Blake acted as my agent. He saw an opportunity and really pushed for me. Sounds like a hell of a... friend. Well, you know, that's what's so special about Maggie is her tenacity, you know. She never gives up on her surfing, she never gives up on her art, even when things are going really tough. The only problem is, in order to be ready for the weekend crowd... Wait, the weekend? As in tomorrow? If you let me have today off, I promise I will cover whatever shift whenever you need me. Please. - Come on. - I have a date. You have a date every night. Please. Please? Please, come on. Okay. Anything for my favorite employee. I'm your only employee. Semantics. All right, kiddo. Thanks, AJ. It was, uh, nice meeting you. Maggie, hold up. I'll wait for you outside. What about Cade? What about Cade? What, Dad? I don't know, he... He seems a little... I don't know. Something's naggin' at me. Something's off. You just met him. You don't even know him. Do you? - Hey, you ready? - Yeah. I'm ready. First you saved my life, then you hand me one of my craziest dreams on a silver platter. You make it sound like I did all the work. You didn't? No, you did. The time that you put into the things that you care about. Still, thank you. You're very welcome. Hey, can I ask you something? Anything. Why didn't you ask Cade to help you set this up? Sometimes he's just... too much drama. Ah. So, no invite to the opening, then? No. He never really cared about my art. You work with Cade. You know how he is. - Yeah. - I'm not the jealous type, but the attention he gets from women, from... Tina. What? Nothin'. Tell me. I haven't seen anything, but you're not wrong to think something's going on. I mean, they are very, um... I don't know. They seem... very close. Hey, you know what? I could use a swim. Where? The beach is closed. I... know a place. Trust me. Used to work here in high school. The owner's a really cool guy. When I eventually quit and didn't turn in my card key, he turned a blind eye. I do laps here every night. You know, I did my rookie training in a facility just like this back in Florida. Nice. So, you always come here after hours? Figured tonight was a... special occasion. Well, what are we waiting for? You have a bathing suit? No, but neither do you. Okay. Cute tank. Oh. Best burgers in Florida. I must've eaten a million of these things back home. Doesn't look like you eat too many burgers. You self-conscious? I never said I was self-conscious. Good. You got no reason to be. Knife. Uh, I know it's not standard for a lifeguard, but, uh, you'd be surprised how much fishing line gets discarded in the ocean. Kids can get caught on it and can cut 'em up real bad. Comin' in? Close your eyes. You're peeking. Better? Keep 'em shut. I know you're peeking. I am not! Still there? Maggie? Maggie? Maggie... Hi. Hi. I needed this. You're gonna be back riding those waves in no time. I hope so. Lately I keep thinking, maybe I set myself up for disappointment, living my whole life around surfing. I mean, it's how I wound up here. I thought you came here for college. Yeah, but I picked the university closest to the beach that would accept me, majored in oceanography of all things. But that was just an excuse to surf, till I dropped out. Why? After I got hurt, nothing seemed to matter anymore, till my art came along. Every time we talk, it's like a therapy session. Well, I like getting to know you. Tell me something about you. I am really not that interesting. Trust me. Agree to disagree. Name a color. - What? - A color. Any color, quick. Um... pink. Hmm. I knew you were peeking. Guilty. Oh my God. What? We fell asleep. Someone's here. You've reached Maggie's phone. Thanks for calling. Leave me a message. Maggie, I... I know that you're upset, and I totally respect that, but, please, just... just let me know that you're okay. Please? I've been calling you all night. That was close, huh? Oh no. Oh no. Don't answer. He's been calling all night. I have to. I said no! You know, just be quiet. There's still a guy here. Remember? Hey. Maggie, I've been calling you! Are you okay? I'm fine. I found your car at the swimming complex. Why are you at the swimming complex? You're always here. I thought... I thought maybe you came for an early swim for your rehab. - Are you inside? - No! I was, though. Stopped by last night for a swim. Battery died, had to leave my car there. I've been... so worried about you. I thought... I thought something might have happened to you. I'm... fine. Promise. Okay. Well, when you're ready to talk, I'm here. Thank you. Love you. Bye. If you're looking for Maggie, I gave her the rest of the day off, if that's why you're here. She looked exhausted. Hey, I thought you were a Daytona guy. Mackey's, best burgers in Florida. Yeah. Right. Only, they're found in Cocoa Beach. I thought you'd never been there. Guess it wasn't that memorable. Dude, some of the best wa... You know, you ask a lot of questions. Could get you in trouble. Do you have any comment on the disappearance - of Alicia Boyd? - Get out of my face! But I like trouble... Ryan. Why are you following me? I want to have a little chat... Ryan. You said you used to swim. Why'd you stop? What? You don't look injured. - Why'd you stop swimming? - I just quit, dude. Yeah, you look like a quitter. Who the hell do you think you are? See, that's the problem with the world, AJ. People lack the will, the drive that burns so deep inside that it hurts to not go after your dreams. Everyone's the same. Athletes, swimmers, women. Women like Alicia Boyd, Ryan? - My name is Blake. - I know you said your name was, but this says otherwise. Start talking, or I tell Maggie and then the police. Whoa, hot date tonight? You could say that. Where do you think he's going? Tina! Hey. What an incredible turnout! I know, and I've already sold two pieces. Congratulations. I'm not even surprised. This is great. I've noticed that. - Where'd you get it? - Uh, my father. He's the one that got me into the ocean, surfing. He promised we'd travel the country, surf every great beach on the coast, but... he died when I was a kid. Hey, he would be really proud of you tonight. And I know, one day, you're gonna surf those beaches. Everyone, may I have your attention please? Welcome to opening night of the Maggie Temple exhibit here at Seaside Art Gallery. A very special night for a very talented artist. Maggie, please, say a few words. Go get 'em. Come on, come on, come on! Sam, I don't know how to thank you for this opportunity. And thank you all sincerely for being here. The ocean has always been my outlet. First with surfing, but when that was taken away from me, when my world seemed so dark, I again found my light in the ocean through these pieces. It's my honor to share them with you all. Impressive. Cade... I can't believe you did all this, Maggie. I did. Worked really hard. You always show up uninvited, Cade? Maggie, I have tried to give you the space that you have asked for, but... Get your hands off her, man. Stop! Stop it! Stop! - Yeah, what? - Cade, stop! Stop. Me? Just go, please. He started it. He's the one. - You okay? - You need to leave too. - He attacked me! - You were looking for a fight, Blake. - Maggie... - Just leave. Please. Leave. Come on, you have to talk to me at some point. No, I don't. Maggie, please! I know you don't believe me, but I was really proud of you last night. You never cared about my art before. I was an idiot, an idiot that was terrified of losing the most important thing in his life. Just words, Cade. They're not. This isn't a good time. AJ didn't show up this morning. He was probably up all night with another date. I have seen him put this out front a million times. He's not gonna mind if you do it just once. Thirty minutes. Please. After that, if you never want to talk to me again, I'll accept it. Clock starts now. Hello? Is someone in here? Hello? Hello? Do you want anything? How did the rest of your exhibit go? I sold quite a few pieces. The owner, Sam, asked when I could have more work ready for another display in a couple months, so... good, I guess. I'm glad that people are starting to see your talent. I should've been more supportive. There's something I need to tell you. Okay. Um, the other night, before the exhibition... Cade Kerrigan! Cade Kerrigan! Don't keep your fans waiting. - You are my priority. - Cade, Cade, can we please get - a picture with you, please?! - You're so hot! Go, now, anything to get them to shut up. - I'll be right back. - Okay. I promise. Okay. Go! Are you kidding me? Tina? What? - These are not mine. - She literally just sent them to you, right in front of my face. - I promise, these are... - Just like you promised there was nothing going on between you two? It was only one time! Don't speak to me again. Ever. All secrets come to light eventually, Cade. There you are. How could you? What? The pictures, Tina. What pictures? Where did you get those? - You sent them. - No, I didn't. My phone was stolen this morning. Then who did? Blake. I knew someone was in the girls' shower this morning, creeping around, but I had no idea my phone was taken until after he'd gotten away. Wait! We need to handle this the right way. Knockin' him on his ass seems like a good start. Maggie saw the photos. She thinks you sent them. Cade, listen to me. What happened that night between us... was my fault, too. I've felt guilty ever since. Let me help you make this right. Let me talk to her. I don't want you to lose Maggie. Okay, give it a try. She won't listen to me right now. But somebody's got to stop this guy. Where the hell are you, AJ? Hey, Maggie. I need to talk to you. Little busy. Maybe text me, like you do with Cade. Maggie... This has to do with Cade. I'm sure it does. I didn't send those photos. Doesn't matter. He's all yours now. You don't understand. My phone, it was taken and... I understand perfectly. Cade told me. You two slept together, right? Am I right, Tina? - Yes. Once, but... - Once is enough. Now leave me alone. What is that? Why do you have Blake's stopwatch? Please, let's talk. When I arrive. When I leave. My lunch break? It's all in there, Maggie. He's been watching you for a while. For what? The perfect time to step in? "Alicia Boyd"? Maybe the last girl he did this to. This is insane. Yeah, insane like stealing my phone and sending my private vacation pics to Cade? Right. But it doesn't change what Cade did with you. You're right, and I'm truly sorry, Maggie. I want you to know that Cade really regrets what he did. What we did. We all make mistakes. I have too. There's something I need to tell Cade. Let him know I'll call him later tonight, okay? Yeah, okay. Going to have a word with Blake. Wait. Are you sure that's a good idea? I need to know the truth. Blake? - Blake! - Coming! Hold on! Hey, Maggie. Good to see you. I need to talk to you. Okay, coming right down. Hey, how's it going? You dropped this. Look, I appreciate everything you've done for me... but... But? Now I need you to leave me alone. Cade? He has nothing to do with this. So you're not getting back with him, though, right? Leave him out of this. What about the other night at the pool? It was nothing. Just a one-time thing. That wasn't nothing. Maggie, that... that was love. Oh my God. You're delusional, I don't love you. Please... Maggie, please don't do this. Please. Lunchtime, right? Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Cade, I thought I said... Hey, where are you? - I'm at home. - At home? I said I would be here in ten minutes. - Be where? - Tina said meet you by the old shack. So, I'm here. Cade, I haven't seen Tina for hours. Blake... Cade? Cade? Cade. Cade! Cade. Cade... Cade, can you hear me? Cade, Cade... Sorry, I didn't know who else to call. No problem. That's what the tower telephone is for. - You said you tried the police? - Yes, and they don't even think it's real, just some social media hoax to boost Cade's number of followers. - Really? - Yeah. But something happened to him, I know it. First, he was talking about the old shack... But I didn't want to go there alone. Then Blake, and then nothing. - Blake? - Yeah. That was the last thing he said, I think. Oh my God. Oh my God, Cade. Oh my God. Cade. Everyone, back up! 10-20 by Tower Three. I'm so sorry, Maggie. I know AJ was a great guy. You really want to help out? Of course. Keep Blake away from his tower for a bit. What are you gonna do? Find out his secrets. Hey, Blake. Crazy day, right? I mean, first, Cade disappears and then AJ washes up on shore. - Things happen. - Do they? Like, on the same day? It just seems a little weird to me. People don't know the ocean and respect it, and they drown. It's part of the job. Well, what about Cade? Well, maybe he wasn't the guy we all thought he was. I'm sure he had some secrets to hide. Right, Tina? Come on. What did you take? Oh my God. - Oh, no, I think... - Oh, yes. Okay. Sam, I can't really talk right now. Maggie, it's important. Everything okay? Your work. It's all gone. Gone? All of it, every... Every single piece stolen. I'm sorry, Maggie. I... I just don't know what kind of a person would do something like this. Something tells me I might know. Dammit! I'm sorry, babe. Shh! I really wish you didn't see that. Good morning, beautiful. Yeah, it's morning. I had to borrow a little ketamine from work, make sure you got a good night's sleep. Now... Don't be angry, honey, but I didn't want you to wake up before we were settled at home. Yeah, I mean, this was my home, but now, with you here, we can start over somewhere new, somewhere nice, with gorgeous, clean beaches all up and down the coast just like your dad wanted. Somebody help me! - Somebody help me! - Shh, shh, shh. Hey, save your energy, sweetheart. No one can even hear us all the way out here. Okay? What'd you do to Cade? What I had to. I had to. And AJ? Did you do that to him? That, that is all in the past. All right, now, with you here, I can finally start over. No more living off the grid, moving across the country, hiding out. Is that why you live here? You've done this before? You can't run from what you've done. Oh, I'm not running. Not anymore. My life changed. The moment I pulled you out of that water, when I saved your life... everything changed. You can't deny it. Your life changed, too. Nothing changed. You're a lifeguard. You saved other swimmers. - I'm no different. - Oh, but, Maggie, you are different. Okay, I thought I knew passion and determination, but I didn't, no, not until I saw you out there. That is when I knew. That was the moment I knew that I loved you. You don't know what love is. No, no, you don't know what love is, not until you are willing to kill to have it. It's you and me now, okay? I've got so many plans for us. But something happened to him, I know it. First, he was talking about the old shack. How do you like the name "Laura"? You look like a Laura. Laura's good. Laura, it is. Relax. You don't need this anymore, Laura. This is from Maggie's past. And Maggie... Hey, she doesn't exist anymore, okay? Can I use the restroom, please? Hey, of course you can. I'll show you. Easy. All right. It's in the other room just around the corner. But don't be long, sweetheart. I'll be waiting. No. Cade! Oh my God. Cade. Help! Look who I found creeping around outside. You know, you're really hard to get rid of, Tina. - How'd you find us? - Go to hell. Leave her alone. Please, I'll... I'll do anything you want, just... just leave her alone. If she is alive, you and I can't be together. That's not true. You're gonna do anything I want anyway, Laura. "Laura"? Tina! She came between us! We can't have anyone between us anymore! Wait, Blake! Wait, Blake. Stop. - Shut up! - No, um... I, um, I never... I never told you... how much I love you. I do love you. - And, um... - Don't lie to me! I'm not, I'm not lying. I... I promise. And I'll, um... I'll always be thankful you saved my life. Best day ever, right? Tina! Tina, wake up! Dammit! I'll go get help. Where are you going, Laura? I'll always find you. What are you gonna do, make me another picture? Nope. Looking good since the divorce. Very fit. Agh! Help! Please help me! Help me! Help! - Finally. - Help!
