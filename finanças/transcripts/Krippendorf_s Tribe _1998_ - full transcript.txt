THANK YOU. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. - HE'S TERRIFIED. COLLEAGUES, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, PRESIDENT PORTER. THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN EAGERLY ANTICIPATING HAS FINALLY ARRIVED. I KNOW, YOU'RE ALL CHOMPING AT THE BIT TO HEAR ABOUT THIS TRULY ASTONISHING WORK. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADIEU AND WITH GREAT PRIDE, I GIVE YOU MY OLD FRIEND AND DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE, PROFESSOR JAMES KRIPPENDORF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR, UH, FOR COMING. UH, FIRST, I-I, UH, WOULD LIKE TO, UH, APOLOGIZE... FOR THE ABBREVIATED NATURE OF THIS FIRST PROXMIRE LECTURE. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE EXTRA TIME TO PREPARE... BEFORE I DID THESE PRESENTATIONS. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY, THE TRIBE IN QUESTION. UM-- THE TRIBE IN QUESTION, UH, UM-- WELL, ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD BY, UH, MOUNTAINS... AND, UH, UH, EXTENSIVE SWAMP LAND, UH, THE, UH, TRIBE IN QUESTION HAD BEEN UNTOUCHED BY CIVILIZATION... UNTIL, UH, TWO YEARS AGO... WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED... BY MY WIFE AND MYSELF. UM... QUESTIONS ? OKAY. OKAY. THE, UH-- THE, UH, UM-- - PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF ? - YES. IN THE PROPOSAL FOR THIS GRANT, IT IS WRITTEN, AND I QUOTE: "I BELIEVE WHEN FOUND, THEY WILL ASTOUND US." YES, UH, THAT, YES-- "THEY WILL ASTOUND US." YES, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. GIVE US AN EXAMPLE. - UH, AN EXAMPLE OF-- - OF HOW THEY WILL ASTOUND US. OF HOW THEY WILL ASTOUND US. YES. UM, WELL, THEY WILL ASTOUND US-- YOU, UM-- UH, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DOMESTIC UNIT. A DOMESTIC UNIT, WHICH UNTIL NOW... IS UNHEARD OF IN NEOLITHIC SOCIETY. AND WHAT IS THIS DOMESTIC UNIT ? THAT IS A, UH-- WHAT WE WOULD CALL A SINGLE-PARENT HOME. YOU'RE SAYING A YOUNG FEMALE... IS ALLOWED TO RAISE A FAMILY BY HERSELF ? NO, I AM-- I AM SAYING SOMETHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THAT. I AM SAYING THAT, UH, THE SINGLE PARENT IN THIS INSTANCE... IS MALE. WELL, THAT'S A FIRST. I FIND IT FASCINATING. SO DO I, PROFESSOR MICELLI. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE SINGLE FATHER-- IF I MIGHT CALL HIM THAT-- IS HIGHLY REGARDED IN THIS COMMUNITY. HE IS CALLED THE UTABAJI, WHICH LITERALLY TRANSLATES AS "THE ESTEEMED SINGLE PARENT." YOU MEAN THE MALE IN QUESTION DID NOT RUN OFF... AND FIND ANOTHER FEMALE TO IMMEDIATELY OPPRESS ? NO, THAT'S NOT THE WAY THEY OPERATE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WITH ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTY THAT THEY HAVE, SINGLE FATHERS WITH CHILDREN... HAVE IMMENSE PRIDE IN THE COMFORT AND CLEANLINESS... OF THEIR DOMESTIC HUT. WHAT ARE THEY CALLED ? HUH ? DO THEY HAVE A NAME, PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF ? OF COURSE THEY HAVE A NAME. UH, UH-- THE, UH, THE "SHELMIKEDMU." - THE SHEL-- SHELMIKEDMU. - WHAT ? THE SHELMIKEDMU. BUT, PROFESSOR, WITHOUT SEXUAL PARTNERS, WOULD THIS NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE, UH, SOCIAL BALANCE OF THE COMMUNITY ? AH, THAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT IS A SUPERB QUESTION. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE DO HAVE AN OBJECT HERE TODAY... WHICH SOLVES THAT VERY PROBLEM THAT YOU WERE MENTIONING. I'M SORRY. HERE. ALL RIGHT, NOW, UH, THIS LITTLE ITEM HERE... IS CALLED BY THE SHELMIKEDMU A SHUTAL. A SHUTAL, SEE ? THAT TAKES TALENT. IT'S A VERY, VERY POWERFUL TOTEM. IT HAS, AS YOU CAN SEE, BOTH A MALE AND A FEMALE PLUG. AND IT IS, IN FACT, A MARITAL DEVICE. I-I-IT'S A NEOLITHIC DILDO. WOULD YOU CARE TO, UH-- PASS THAT DOWN TO DR. ALLEN, PLEASE. YOU CAN TAKE IT HOME FOR THE WEEKEND IF YOU'D LIKE. HMM. THANK YOU. WONDERFUL. OUTSTANDING ! I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE WAY YOU HANDLED OUR RESIDENT BLOWHARD, RUTH ALLEN. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFUL. I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO BE PART OF THIS. PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF. OH ! MRS. PROXMIRE WILL BE THRILLED WHEN I TELL HER HOW WELL IT WENT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU. QUITE A RELIEF. OH, YES. YES, YES. WHEN CAN I SEE THE FILM ? YOU DO HAVE FILM, DON'T YOU ? OF COURSE HE HAS FILM. OH, MY GOD, IT'S MAGNIFICENT FILM. THE IMAGERY. WHEN I FIRST SAW IT, I WAS AMAZED. EXCELLENT. I'LL PLAN TO SCREEN SOME AT THE LECTURE ON FRIDAY. WE'LL BE THERE. MM-HMM. SEE YOU THEN. ISN'T THIS EXCITING ? OW. WHAT ? FOOTAGE IS GOOD, ISN'T IT ? PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF, THIS IS MR. SCHRAMM AT THE BANK. I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED YOUR CHECK. CALL ME. THANK YOU. - WHAT'S THIS FOR ? - A URINE SAMPLE. I WANNA KNOW WHAT DRUGS YOU'RE ON. I HAD TO TELL THEM SOMETHING. HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH ? THAT I SPENT ALL THE MONEY AND I DIDN'T COMPLETE THE RESEARCH. THAT'D DAZZLE 'EM. - HOW BIG A GRANT DID THEY GIVE YOU ? - A HUNDRED THOUSAND. DOLLARS ? AWESOME. WE DIDN'T SPEND IT ALL IN NEW GUINEA, SO HOW COULD YOU SQUANDER THAT MUCH MONEY ? SQUANDER ? LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS, MY LITTLE "SQUANDEES." FOOD, CLOTHING, SHELTER. BIG SCREEN TVs, VCRs, COUNSELING SESSIONS. THOSE WERE A WASTE OF TIME. CLEARLY. T-THEY EXPECT TO SEE FILM FOOTAGE. EXCUSE ME. WHO IS THE ADULT IN THIS ROOM ? DON'T ANSWER THAT ! I AM THE ADULT IN THIS ROOM. A SMALL POINT: THE ADULT IN THIS ROOM DOESN'T HAVE ANY FILM FOOTAGE. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY ? BECAUSE THERE IS NO TRIBE. YEAH ? WELL, EVERYBODY IN THAT AUDIENCE TONIGHT THINKS THERE IS A TRIBE. THAT'S TRUE. THAT IS VERY, VERY TRUE. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ? WHAT I AM SAYING IS... THAT YOU TAKE A LITTLE NISHOWIKU... AND YOU ADD A LITTLE IMATOSA, AND YOU THROW IN A DASH OF KATANKA, AND YOU'VE GOT THE SHELMIKEDMU, HUH ? THEY WANT THE SHELMIKEDMU, THEY'RE GONNA GET THE SHELMIKEDMU. HUH ? SO, UH, LET'S GET SOME PALM TREES. NO PALM TREES. WE DON'T NEED PALM TREES. ALL RIGHT, UH, VENUS FLYTRAPS ? VENUS FLYTRAPS ? * HAVE YOU EVER BEEN CLOSE TO TRAGEDY * * OR BEEN CLOSE TO FOLKS WHO HAVE * * HAVE YOU EVER FELT THE PAIN SO POWERFUL * * SO HEAVY YOU COLLAPSE NO ? WELL... * I NEVER HAD TO KNOCK ON WOOD * IT'S TOO SKINNY. I'M WORKING ON IT. IT NEEDS TO BE ABOUT THIS MUCH WIDER. OKAY. LOOK AT THIS. YES. * I NEVER HAD TO KNOCK ON WOOD * * AND I'M GLAD I HAVEN'T YET * * BECAUSE I'M SURE IT ISN'T GOOD * * THAT'S THE IMPRESSION THAT I GET * OH, HELLO, PUMPKIN. HOW ARE YOU ? DO YOU REMEMBER ME FROM YESTERDAY ? I'M VERONICA MICELLI. I'M FRIENDS WITH YOUR DADDY. I BROUGHT THIS REALLY NICE REPORTER HERE. WE JUST WANNA ASK HIM A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS-- * I NEVER HAD TO KNOCK ON WOOD * * AND I'M GLAD I HAVEN'T YET * * BECAUSE I'M SURE IT ISN'T GOOD * * THAT'S THE IMPRESSION THAT I GET ** COME ON, GUYS ! WE'RE LOSIN' THE LIGHT. HEY ! THE SHELMIKEDMU DO NOT ALLOW PICTURES TAKEN WITHOUT THE RITUAL BODY PAINT ON. - NICELY PUT. - IT IS OUR WAY. YO ! IT'S REALLY GREAT, YOU KNOW THAT ? WHAT ? THE WAY YOU ARE. YOU KNOW, ALWAYS HELPING OUT AROUND HERE, DOING THINGS FOR US-- THE ANSWER IS NO. WHAT ? I'M NOT PLAYING BOO-BOO, THE NATIVE GIRL. SHELLY, IT'S ONLY ONE FILM. YOU'RE A FRAUD. I NEED YOU. NO WAY. SHELLY ! NOW CATCH THE CHICKEN. IF IT DOESN'T COME IN A BUCKET, I DON'T TOUCH IT. SHELLY, DON'T BREAK MY HUMP, OKAY ? CATCH THE CHICKEN. THEY'RE GONNA REPOSSESS MY HUT. COME ON, COME ON. LET'S GO. LET'S GO. GO, GO, GO ! GO ! ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. QUICKER, QUICKER. COME ON, LET'S GO. SHELLY ! SHELLY ! THAT'S IT. COME ON. GET YOUR HANDS ON THE LITTLE SON OF A-- E-EXCELLENT WORK. VERY, VERY GOOD. - NOW WHAT ? - NOW COOK THE CHICKEN. I JUST CHASED POULTRY THROUGH MY BACKYARD LOOKING LIKE TAMMY FAYE BAKKER. YOU OWE ME. THANK YOU, BOO-BOO. WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? TO A FRIEND'S. SHUT UP ! BESIDES, YOU'RE PART OF OUR TRIBE. THERE IS NO TRIBE. OH, AND ONE SMALL POINT: MAYBE EDMUND'S TUTU SHOULD HAVE A FEW MORE LEAVES. - I MEAN, HOW MANY NEOLITHIC TRIBES PRACTICE CIRCUMCISION ? - WHOOPS. BOO-BOO HAS MADE AN EXCELLENT POINT. THAT WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF OUR FILM. A RARE, PRIMITIVE CIRCUMCISION RITUAL. YES ! IN WHICH THE OLDER BROTHER PERFORMS THE ACTUAL DEED. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS IS NOT NIGHTMARE ON "SHELMIKEDMU" STREET. THIS IS A DELICATE RITUAL BETWEEN BROTHERS. SH-- SORRY. ALL RIGHT, YOUR WEE-WEE'S ON THE LOG. OKAY. NOW WHAT ? THE YOUNG SHELMIKEDMU BOY SITS AT THE EGALA ALTAR... WAITING FOR HIS OLDER BROTHER TO GUIDE HIM THROUGH THE PORTALS OF MANHOOD. EGALA ALTAR. THAT'S A NICE LITTLE DETAIL. THERE'S A SPIDER ON THE LOG. - OH, OH, OH. OH, OH. MICKEY. THERE WAS A SPIDER. OH. WHATEVER. OKAY, LET THE CEREMONY BEGIN. EXCUSE ME, UH, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE OLDER BROTHER DOING ? HE IS COMPLETING THE RITUAL DANCE... IN WHICH HE ASKS THE GODS TO PROTECT THE YOUNG BOY... FROM MANY BRIDES WHO WANT HIM AND HIS PIG WEALTH. HEY, YOU PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THIS, HAVEN'T YOU ? IT'S MY TRIBE. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. NOW, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. EDMUND, YOU'RE-- YOU'RE LOOKING UP TO THE GODS WITH TREPIDATION. TREPIDATION. TREPIDATION, TREPIDATION, TREPIDATION. UM, WELL, YOU'RE REALLY AFRAID THAT YOUR BROTHER IS GOING TO CHOP YOUR WEE-WEE OFF. AH, THERE WE GO. EXCELLENT TREPIDATION. ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE FOOTAGE FROM OUR LAST TRIP TO NEW GUINEA. OKAY, WE JUST NEED TO SHOOT A FEW MORE PIECES. LOOK AT THE CAMERA. ONE, TWO, THREE, AH ! COME ON, AH ! AH ! - ONE, TWO, THREE. - AH ! EXCELLENT. DID YOU GET THAT ? NO, HERE. TILT THAT. THERE YOU ARE. CAN YOU SEE HIM NOW ? THERE WE GO. OKAY, READY ? MAGUNGA. EDMUND, LOOK MISERABLE. EXCELLENT. HERE GOES NOTHIN'. GOOD JOB. AT FIRST GLANCE, THE SHELMIKEDMU APPEAR TO BE A SOMEWHAT TYPICAL NEW GUINEA TRIBE, AS UNREMARKABLE AS THEY ARE UNDISCOVERED. HOWEVER, THAT ALL CHANGED WHEN WE BEGAN TO FOCUS IN... ON ONE PARTICULAR FAMILY UNIT. ALTHOUGH THERE IS, UH, NO EVIDENCE, UH, OF CIRCUMCISION AMONG OTHER NEW GUINEA TRIBES, WE FIND THAT CIRCUMCISION IS A RITUAL USED BY THE SHELMIKEDMU. NOW, THE UNCIRCUMCISED CHILD OF A SHELMIKEDMU FAMILY HERE... IS WAITING PATIENTLY AT THE EGALA ALTAR FOR HIS OLDER BROTHER... WHO WILL BE THE ONE TO GUIDE HIM INTO MANHOOD. MAGUNGA. HERE, THE OLDER BOY IS HANDED THE SACRED POLA BAR... BY THE NATIVE SHAMAN. NOW, THIS AXE, WHICH HAS BEEN FASHIONED FROM STONE, HAS BEEN USED TO CIRCUMCISE TRIBAL MEMBERS FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS. NOW, THIS IS INTERESTING. THE OLDER BROTHER HERE IS PERFORMING A RITUAL DANCE, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO ASK THE GODS FOR A STEADY HAND... FOR WHAT WILL SURELY BE A DELICATE, UH, PROCEDURE. AND HERE WE ARE. - AH ! QUITE REMARKABLE, YES ? AMAZING. PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF, I WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK TO A COUPLE OF MY STUDENTS HERE. I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO GO TO MY SON'S SCIENCE FAIR. SCIENTIST ! CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK. OH, PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF. PROFESSOR. PROFESSOR, I HAVE SOMEBODY I WANT YOU TO MEET. MAY I SPEAK TO YOU PRIVATELY FOR A SECOND ? THIS IS AN INTERVIEW WITH VERONICA MICELLI ABOUT THE SHELMIKEDMU. YEAH, I KNOW. DOES THAT UPSET YOU ? YES, IT DOES UPSET ME. THANK YOU. GOD. SEE, ME, TOO, BECAUSE THEY TOLD US... THEY WERE GONNA GIVE US A FULL-COLOR PHOTO AND THREE COLUMNS. THE POINT IS: YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO GIVE THIS INTERVIEW. WHAT ? THIS PAPER HAS A CIRCULATION OF 35,000, JAMES. THAT'S NOT THE POINT ! PROFESSOR ! THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. WILL YOU SHUT UP ! IT IS NOT YOUR LECTURE. IT IS NOT HER TRIBE. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. AND THIS ARTICLE IS A BRAZEN ATTEMPT AT SELF-PROMOTION. I AM CRUSHED THAT YOU WOULD SAY THAT, JAMES. MAY I CALL YOU JAMES ? NO ! BUT, SPEAKING OF PROMOTION, I HAVE SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO MEET. PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF, MEET HENRY "SPIVVEY." SPIVEY. I'M A GREAT ADMIRER OF YOURS, PROFESSOR. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THRILLED TO RECEIVE YOUR CALL. MY CALL ? WELL, MR. SPIVEY OPERATES A NEW CABLE TV NETWORK... DEDICATED TO ANTHROPOLOGY CALLED PRIMAL TIME. - YOU'RE JOKING ? - NO, I AM NOT, AND I WANT YOU TO COME ON BOARD. GIVE ME THE TELEVISION RIGHTS TO THE SHELMIKEDMU STORY. NO. PROFESSOR, WE SHARE THE GOAL OF MAKING ANTHROPOLOGY ACCESSIBLE TO THE COMMON MAN. THE COMMON MAN COULD GIVE A SHIT. WELL, NO, THAT'S JUST BECAUSE ANTHROPOLOGY HAS NEVER BEEN PRESENTED TO THEM... AS RELEVANT TO THEIR LIVES BEFORE. OUR LITTLE SHELMIKEDMU DEAL WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE EVERY DAY: LONELINESS, DESPAIR, INTENSE SEXUAL LONGING. UH, NEXT WE HAVE MICHAEL KRIPPENDORF... WITH HIS PROJECT ON A TRIBE FROM THE JUNGLES OF NEW GUINEA. ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL. I AM A MEMBER OF THE SHELMIKEDMU TRIBE. THESE PIGS, A STAPLE OF THE SHELMIKEDMU'S ECONOMY, ARE ADORNED WITH HORNBILLED BEAKS AND BIRD-OF-PARADISE FEATHERS. THIS STRUCTURE IS CALLED AN OJATANI. IT IS USED ONLY ONCE BY THE WOMEN OF MY TRIBE. IT IS BUILT TO HOUSE A YOUNG VIRGIN... EXPERIENCING HER FIRST MENSTRUATION. - WHAT DID HE SAY ? AT FIRST SIGNS OF MENSES, THE YOUNG FEMALE IS ANOINTED WITH PIG URINE... AND PLACED IN THE MENARPAT, WHERE SHE WILL REMAIN FOR THREE DAYS... UNTIL THE SPIRITS OF MAIDENHOOD HAVE LEFT HER BODY. ISN'T THAT INTERESTING ? THANK YOU, MICHAEL. NEXT WE HAVE ADAM KANT AND HIS LIMA BEAN GRAPHS. BECAUSE SHE'S IN HER FIRST DAYS OF MENSTRUATION, - I'VE PLACED ABBEY TOURNQUIST IN THE MENARPAT. - OH, MY GOD, IT'S ABBEY ! I SHALL NOW DOUSE HER WITH THE SACRED PIG URINE. AAAAH ! PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS. - NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM. CAN I TALK TO YOU ? - ABBEY, COME OUT OF THERE NOW ! NOT UNTIL I'M PURIFIED. DISCUSS IT ? DISCUSS ? DISCUSS WHAT ? I AM NOT SENDING MY KIDS TO ANY BOARDING SCHOOL. HEY ! TIME OUT, TIME OUT, TIME OUT ! UNFORTUNATELY, THESE PROBLEMS ARE NOT CONFINED TO MICKEY. HIS BEHAVIOR SEEMS TO BE AFFECTING EDMUND. EDMUND WAS ASKED TO DRAW "WHAT I ENJOYED MOST ABOUT MY WEEKEND." LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THAT DRAWING. I WANNA SEE THE DRAWING. WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU ? GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF IT. WOULD YOU STOP ACTING LIKE A CHILD ? ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST CALM DOWN HERE. THE FACT IS, A SCHOOL LIKE CHESTER HILLS, WITH ITS EMPHASIS ON DISCIPLINE, IS PROBABLY A BETTER CHOICE. MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY. I APOLOGIZE. I GUESS THINGS MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF HAND, AND, UH, I'M NOT MAKING ANY EXCUSES, BUT I SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO GO TO BOARDING SCHOOL, SO FROM NOW ON, NO MORE CRAZY BEHAVIOR. THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE. I GIVE YOU MY WORD. ANOTHER MAGICAL DAY IN THE KRIPPENDORF HOUSEHOLD, MR. SCHRAMM. THE CHILDREN ARE ALL READY FOR SCHOOL, AND THEY'RE CLEAN AND COIFFED AND ANXIOUS TO EMBARK ON ANOTHER DAY OF LEARNING. MICKEY, TAKE THAT HEADDRESS OFF. I MEAN, TAKE THAT RED DRESS OFF. I MEAN, TAKE THAT RED DRESS AND GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER. WHAT ? I-- NO, SIR. NO, SIR, THE CHECK IS IN THE-- YES, I'LL HOLD. OF COURSE I'LL HOLD. GOOD MORNING, SWEETHEART. DARLING, HONEY, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION... SERIOUSLY ? ARE YOU HAPPY ? THE COLOR WON'T COME OUT OF MY HAIR. FORECLOSURE ? ARE YOU SERIOUS ? NO, NO, NO. NO. NO, NO, NO, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT YOU WEREN'T SERIOUS. NO, NO. LEO-- MAY I CALL YOU LEO ? MR. SCHRAMM, I KNOW THAT DEADLINES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE IGNORED, BUT PLEASE DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH. THE CHECK WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS BY 3:00 THIS AFTERNOON. I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL BRING IT MYSELF. I'M READY TO MAKE A DEAL. VERONICA ! - CAN I TALK TO YOU IN PRIVATE FOR A SECOND ? - YES. I KNEW YOU'D SEE IT MY WAY. OKAY, SO HOW WE'RE GONNA PLAY THIS-- DON'T GIVE AWAY THE MERCHANDISING ! THIS IS AN INSULT TO ANTHROPOLOGY. THAT'S RIGHT, AN INSULT. THIS SEEMS FINE TO ME. JAMES' STYLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNCONVENTIONAL. UH, UNCONVENTIONAL. GERALD, FOR GOD'S SAKE, THIS IS TABLOID ANTHROPOLOGY. THE SHELMIKEDMU DEMI-BRA ? IT'S TABLOID. YOU'RE JEALOUS. OH, YOU'RE RIDICULOUS. I'VE NEVER BEEN JEALOUS OF ANYONE IN MY LIFE. BULLSHIT. THE SHELMIKEDMU HAVE CAPTURED THE IMAGINATION OF THE PUBLIC. UNLIKE YOUR MUSTY OLD GALINCAS. WHICH BY COMPARISON STRIKE ME AS-- OH, WHAT'S THAT WORD ? BORING. KRIPPENDORF IS SENSATIONALIZING THIS TRIBE FOR HIS OWN FINANCIAL GAIN. OH, GET A GRIP. PROFESSOR, PLEASE, JUST-- PLEASE ! JAMES' STYLE MAY NOT BE TO YOUR LIKING, BUT MISS MICELLI IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THANKS TO KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE, THIS DEPARTMENT'S REPUTATION IS GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS, AND I, FOR ONE, AM DELIGHTED. WELL, YOU MAY BE FALLING FOR THIS SHELMIKEDMU CRAP, BUT EVERY INSTINCT IN MY BODY TELLS ME THAT THIS STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN. - EXCUSE ME, RUTH. - MINE TOO ! - MINE, TOO, PROFESSOR. IN FACT, I DON'T THINK THERE IS A SHELMIKEDMU TRIBE. ALL RIGHT, MISS PROFESSOR KNOW-IT-ALL. IF YOU'RE SO SURE THERE'S NO TRIBE, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF TO MOUNT BOSAVI AND PROVE IT. - I SHOULD. - THAT'S RIGHT. SHE SHOULD. - GO AHEAD. - I JUST MIGHT. - BE MY GUEST. - HAH ! I WILL ! LORI AND I WILL LEAVE TOMORROW. THAT'S RIGHT, TOMORROW. WE WILL ? RUTH. RUTH ! * BOOGIE FEVER * YOU GOT TO BOOGIE DOWN * BOOGIE FEVER * I THINK IT'S GOIN' AROUND ** OH, MY GOD, I'D FORGOTTEN. OH, THE DECAY, THE STENCH. THE CHAOS. OH, POPO, WE'RE HOME. SO MUCH CLEANER IN THE BOOKS. WE'LL GO FIND SOMEONE TO TAKE US WHERE WE'RE GOING. LORI, YOU LOOK POSITIVELY GREEN. YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING. WHO WANTS TO GET WORK ? YOU ! ME LIKE GO LONG BOSAVI NOW. NO BOSAVI. NO. ME LIKE BUY 'EM TRIPLE MAN. GO BOSAVI. NOT ME ! NOT ME ! YOU, ME, GO BOSAVI NOW. I-I'M FINE, THANK YOU. NOW, FOR THE SHELMIKEDMU, PERSONAL APPEARANCE IS OF PRIMARY CONCERN. AND FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE TEENAGERS, ONE SECOND. THESE RITUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE TERRIBLY PAINFUL AND-- PSST, PSST, PSST. AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME. EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME. IT'S RANDOM HOUSE. THEY LOVE US. SIT DOWN ! UM, THE RITUALS THAT I SPOKE ABOUT... ARE PERFORMED IN A SMALL AND SACRED SHRINE... DAD, SHELLY'S BEEN IN THE BATHROOM FOR AN HOUR ! LOCATED NEAR THE SLEEPING AREA. IN THE CENTER OF THAT SHRINE IS AN ALTAR AFFIXED TO A WALL. INSIDE THESE ALTARS ARE VARIOUS TALISMEN AND POTIONS. LET ME IN ! I'M BUSY. MUCH ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE UNDERARM, A SACRED PART OF THE SHELMIKEDMU ANATOMY. GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE IS BELIEVED TO EMANATE FROM THIS AREA. OH, WELL. ANY OTHER-- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ? YES ? DO THE SHELMIKEDMU PRACTICE DIVORCE ? WELL, WHEN A SHELMIKEDMU COUPLE WISH TO DIVORCE, THE TRIBAL EQUIVALENT OF A LAWYER IS APPOINTED TO EACH SIDE IN THE MARRIAGE. EVERYBODY CONCERNED WORKS VERY HARD TO AVOID AN ANNULMENT FROM HAPPENING. HOWEVER, IF A DIVORCE, IN FACT, TAKES PLACE, THE TWO LAWYERS ARE EXECUTED. YES ! YES ! YES ! THERE'S JUST SO MUCH WE CAN LEARN FROM THE SHELMIKEDMU, EXCEPT FOR THEIR HAIR AND MAKEUP. ANOTHER BRILLIANT LECTURE, PROFESSOR. I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH FOR OUR SWEEPS WEEK VIDEO. UH, SWEEPS WEEK VIDEO ? YES, I PAID YOU FOR IT LAST WEEK. I NEED IT BY MONDAY. AH, SWEET POTATO. IT EXAMINES THE ROLE OF THE SWEET POTATO IN SHELMIKEDMU AGRICULTURE. SWEET POTATO. BORING. WHAT, BORING ? WELL, LET'S SPEAK FRANKLY HERE. WE NEED RATINGS. NOW, WE HAVE THEIR ATTENTION, BUT WE NEED SOMETHING THAT GRABS FOCUS. NOT SWEET POTATOES. PRECISELY. SUCH AS-- SEX. SHELMIKEDMU SEX VIDEOS ? MATING RITUALS, JAMES. ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF ANY FIELD RESEARCH. YOU DID COVER THEM, DIDN'T YOU ? DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. BESIDES, NO ONE IS GONNA WANNA WATCH THE SHELMIKEDMU DO EACH OTHER. CERTAINLY NOT. HOW VULGAR. UNLESS SCIENTIFICALLY PRESENTED, OF COURSE. DON'T MOVE. EXCUSE ME, LADIES. WOULD ANY OF YOU BE INTERESTED IN WATCHING A ONE-HOUR SPECIAL... ON THE MATING RITUALS OF THE SHELMIKEDMU ? YOU MEAN SEX VIDEOS ? OH, ABSOLUTELY. YES. OH, VERY INTERESTED. WHAT NIGHT WILL IT BE ON ? DISCOVERY CHANNEL, EAT YOUR HEART OUT. LOOSEN UP, JAMES. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS OVER A DRINK ? MM. THE SHELMIKEDMU COURTING CHANT. WHEN A SHELMIKEDMU MALE WISHES TO WOO A FEMALE, HE BREAKS THE ICE WITH A DRINK OF FERMENTED JUTEBERRIES AND BANANA SAP. ANOTHER BRANDY, PROFESSOR MICELLI ? OH, CALL ME VERONICA, PLEASE. I REALLY DON'T THINK I SHOULD. NO, A LITTLE MORE. THANK YOU. SO... ARE YOUR CHILDREN SLEEPING ? THEY'RE SPENDING THE EVENING AT THEIR GRANDPARENTS'. OH. AHH. WHAT'S THAT ? THIS ? OH ! THIS IS A KIEFO. THE SHELMIKEDMU USE IT WHEN CHOOSING A BRIDE. OH. HOW DOES IT WORK ? WELL, UH, THAT'S, UH, VERY GRAPHIC. PLEASE. YES, OKAY. UM, JUST BEAR IN MIND THAT I'M SPEAKING TO YOU AS A SCHOLAR... AND NOT AS A MAN WHO FINDS YOU UNBELIEVABLY ATTRACTIVE. THE PROSPECTIVE SHELMIKEDMU BRIDE... HOLDS THE KIEFO THUSLY, ALLOWING HER BREASTS TO FALL OVER THE EDGE, SUGGESTING THE POSSIBILITY OF HER FERTILITY. A SORT OF SHELMIKEDMU WET T-SHIRT CONTEST. YEAH. NOW THESE LINES HERE, UM, INDICATE... HOW LARGE THE BREASTS MIGHT BE... AND ALSO DETERMINE PAYMENT. ONE PIG'S WORTH, TWO PIG'S WORTH, THREE PIG'S WORTH, AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. OH. HERE, LET ME BE THE SHELMIKEDMU VIRGIN. AH. OOH, THERE WE GO. HOW DO I STACK UP ? UM-- WELL, AS THE SHELMIKEDMU WOULD SAY, JAGABONDO ! WHICH ROUGHLY TRANSLATES AS, UH, MORE PIGS THAN YOU CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. WEE-WEE-WEE, ALL THE WAY HOME. OH. WHAT'S THIS HOLE FOR ? THAT HOLE-- BY GOLLY, I THINK YOU FOUND OUT WHAT THAT HOLE IS FOR. EXTRA CREDIT FOR PROFESSOR MICELLI. YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS HAD A CRUSH ON YOU. WHEN I WAS IN YOUR SEMINAR ON THE KINAPOSA, YOU MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE ROOM. YOU WE THE ONLY WOMAN IN THAT ROOM. BE HONEST. ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO ME ? UH-HUH. UH-HUH. ARE YOU JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE I'M HOLDING YOUR PENIS ? WOULD YOU LIKE TO SLIP IN TO SOMETHING MORE... COMFORTABLE ? MM-HMM. AH, AH, AH. AH, YEAH, YEAH. I ALWAYS WONDERED IF ALL THOSE MONTHS IN THE JUNGLE WOULD CHANGE A MAN, BUT, JAMES, I HAD NO IDEA. YOU'RE A WILD MAN. COME HERE. * A-WIMOWEH, A-WIMOWEH A-WIMOWEH, A-WIMOWEH * WIMOWEH. OOH. LAST NIGHT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. MMM, YES, IT WAS. SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TODAY ? UM, LET'S SEE. WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING. YOU KNOW, IT'S NEVER GOOD WHEN COUPLES WORK TOGETHER, SO I'VE DECIDED THAT THIS SHELMIKEDMU THING IS OVER. MM-HMM. I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOWER. OKAY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THIS SHELMIKEDMU THING IS OVER ? WE JUST CAN'T INVADE THESE INNOCENT PEOPLE'S LIVES ANY MORE THAN WE ALREADY HAVE. WHY NOT ? WHY ? BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT. WELL, WELL, WHAT WAS LAST NIGHT ABOUT THEN ? ARE YOU SAYING THAT LAST NIGHT HAPPENED ONLY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BECOME A PARTNER... IN THE SHELMIKEDMU ? NO ! WHAT I AM SAYING IS, I THOUGHT THAT WE-- THAT WH-- GODDAMN IT, WHERE IS MY SHOE ? YOU KNOW WHAT ? I WORKED MY BUTT OFF TO MAKE SHELMIKEDMU THE TALK OF ANTHROPOLOGY. WHO ASKED YOU ? OH, FIND YOURSELF A GENIUS. GORDON. JAMES. CAN WE TALK ? UM-- AS YOU KNOW, IRENE BELIEVES THE CHILDREN BELONG IN CHESTER HILLS, BUT, REALLY, ALL SHE NEEDS IS ASSURANCE... THAT THE CHILDREN ARE BEING RAISED IN A DECENT AND SANITARY ENVIRONMENT. YOU ARE AN EGOMANIACAL MONSTER. DO YOU KNOW THAT ? I'M AT THE FRONT DOOR. WHO'S THAT ? MY NEW HOUSEKEEPER. HOUSEKEEPER ! HOUSEKEEP THIS ! DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE IRONING, MISS MICELLI. HAVE A NICE DAY OFF. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE ? WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ? OUT OF THIS HOUSE. THE OLD SCHOOL TYPE OF HOUSEKEEPER. RUNS THIS HOUSE ANY WAY SHE WANTS, AND GOD HELP THE PERSON WHO GETS IN HER WAY. UH, TUESDAY, AS USUAL ? KISS MY NEOLITHIC ASS ! A PROUD WOMAN. I TRY TO BE SENSITIVE TO HER FEELINGS. YOU FORGOT YOUR GOAT, MISS MICELLI. HURRY UP. LICK, LICK. WE'RE ALMOST UP ON TOP. HURRY UP ! YOU MUST HURRY UP ! DAY THREE. DESPITE MY BEST EFFORTS, THE MOOD OF THE EXPEDITION HAS TURNED AGAINST ME... AND HEAVY WEATHER THREATENS TO DELAY US EVEN-EVEN MORE-- MORE THAN-- MY GOD, THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE GREATEST ASS I'VE EVER SEEN ON A MAN. OLE, MAN. WHAT'S WRONG ? WHAT'S WRONG ? YES, BOSAVI. MAKE WAY ! GO ! YOU CAN TALK TO ME. WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS BOSAVI THING ? TOO DANGEROUS ? TOO SACRED ? WHAT ? NO. TOO FAR UPHILL. GIVE ME THAT ! WOMAN KNOWS HOW TO CUT THE BUSH. DIE, KRIPPENDORF ! LYING, CHEATING-- - OH, MAN, YOU GO. - AAAH ! AAAH ! LICK, LICK ! KRIPPENDORF ! AAAH ! AAAH ! AAAH ! THE SHELMIKEDMU UTABAJI EMBRACES HIS DEATH WITH COURAGE AND DIGNITY. OHH ! AHH. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE TO KILL HIM. I TOLD YOU-- SO WE CAN GET RID OF THIS "SHELMIKEDMU" CRAP. I GOT A BETTER IDEA. THE SHELMIKEDMU FAMILY COULD CELEBRATE THE HARVEST. NAH ! COME ON, MICKEY. LET'S GO. OKAY. READY FOR MY SWEET POTATO, MR. DeMILLE. OKAY, ACTION. - GOD, YOU ARE PATHETIC. - WHAT ? - YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T DOING ANY MORE OF THESE. - OH, GIVE ME A BREAK. I'M DYIN' WITH DIGNITY OUT HERE. WHY DON'T YOU TRY LIVING WITH SOME ? I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT ? GEE, LET'S SEE. WELL, WE'VE HAD THE BACKYARD CIRCUMCISION. WE'VE DANCED WITH THE PIGS TO ENSURE MY FERTILITY. THAT ONE REALLY CHANGED MY LIFE. SO, WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP ? CANNIBALISM ? HEY, MRS. O'BRIAN, ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING TONIGHT ? OH ! SHIT ! WE'RE HAVING A BARBECUE. WEAR SOME HOT SAUCE. WILL YOU KEEP IT DOWN ! LISTEN TO YOU, MS. HIGH AND MIGHTY, TOO BUSY TO HELP YOUR FAMILY. THAT'S SUCH BULLSHIT, AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE A LIAR. I HAD TO LIE ! NOT TO ME, YOU DIDN'T. EVERY TIME YOU DO ONE OF THESE, "IT'S THE LAST ONE." THIS IS THE LAST ONE. SHELLY, WHY DO YOU THINK I'M DRESSED THIS WAY ? I'M KILLING THE UTABAJI. YOU ARE ? YES ! AFTER THIS, IT'S OVER. I'M KILLING THE SON OF A BITCH AND BURYING HIM. WHEN ? NOW. AND AFTER THIS, IT'S BACK TO NORMAL. "NORMAL." WHO IS THAT ? THAT'S IT ! PORTER AND ADAMS SAW ME. WE'RE DEAD ! DAD. DAD ! DAD ! WHAT ? THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S YOU. PERFECT. EDMUND, GO OUTSIDE AND HIDE IN THE HUT. MICKEY, GO TO THE DOOR. DEAN ADAMS. COME IN. THANK YOU. WHO-- WHAT-- WHAT WAS THAT ? WE JUST SAW THE STRANGEST THING. UH-- UH, THAT ? WELL, MY FATHER WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU, BUT, UH-- HE BROUGHT ONE OF THE SHELMIKEDMU HERE TO AMERICA. OH, THIS IS MARVELOUS. UNBELIEVABLE. ARE YOU SERIOUS ? ARE YOU SERIOUS ? THIS IS INCREDIBLE ! GERALD ? YES, JAMES ? WHO'S THAT WITH YOU ? PRESIDENT PORTER, JAMES. I'M SO UPSET. YOU SPOILED MY SURPRISE. YOU HAVE OUTDONE YOURSELF, JAMES. I CAME HERE THIS AFTERNOON...

YEAH, UH, JUST ONE-- ONE, UH-- OH. YEAH. EXCUSE ME. DID YOU KNOW HE WAS PLANNING THIS ? YES. YES, YES, I DID. MAY I USE THE PHONE ? SURE. HE'S GOT AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF HUMOR. - HOW LONG IS HE HERE FOR ? - UH, JUST A LITTLE WHILE. UM, HE'S ON A SUPER SAVER. I'D LIKE HIM TO MEET A FRIEND OF MINE. OH, I-- I'D LIKE THAT, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE, UH, POSSIBLE. Y-YOU SEE, HE HAS TO GET BACK FOR, UH-- FOR SHELRIKU. YES ! THAT'S RIGHT. HE HAS TO GET BACK FOR SHELRIKU. UH-- UH-- THE SWEET POTATO HARVEST. THE SWEET POTATO HAR-- GOD, THAT IS RIGHT ! EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT. THAT'S RIGHT. HAS THE SWEET POTATO HARVEST COME SO QUICKLY AGAIN ? GOSH, ONLY 28 MORE CROPPING DAYS TILL SHELRIKU. HOLD ON. IT'S MY NEPHEW. HE BOOKS TALENT FOR A TALK SHOW, AND HE LOVES THE IDEA. - EXCELLENT ! - TALK SHOW ? OH, I DON'T THINK SO. NO, NO, HE'S GOT A, UH-- NO. NO, NO. NO. YES ! TOMORROW IT IS, THEN. IT'S SETTLED. CONGRATULATIONS, JAMES. OH, DON'T YOU THINK THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION... THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING... * WISHBONE WORLD'S MOST COLORFUL FACE * GOOD EVENING, AND WELCOME TO ANOTHER EPISODE OF... LIFE OF THE SHELMIKEDMU. TONIGHT WE ARE AIRING A VERY SPECIAL... AND PERHAPS CONTROVERSIAL ASPECT... OF PROFESSOR KRIPPENDORF'S UNIQUE TRIBE: THE MATING RITUALS OF THE SHELMIKEDMU. I FEEL OBLIGED TO CLARIFY... FOR THE VIEWER... THAT THE MATERIAL PRESENTED TONIGHT, OFFENSIVE AS IT MAY BE FOR SOME... AND INAPPROPRIATE AS IT MAY BE FOR CHILDREN, IS OFFERED AS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. AND NOW, SIT BACK AND ENJOY. THE MARRIAGE OF A SHELMIKEDMU MALE AND FEMALE... IS CONSUMMATED IN THE RELATIVE PRIVACY OF THE PENUMANA, OR MATRIMONIAL HUT. KEEPING TO CENTURIES OF TRADITION, THE VILLAGERS WAIT OUTSIDE THE HUT, SINGING AND HOPING FOR A SUCCESSFUL AND FERTILE UNION. HO-HO ! AFTER YEARS OF DOMESTIC DRUDGERY... THE YOUNG BRIDE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THIS RARE CHANCE TO LET LOOSE, ACTING IN A WAY THAT, TO THE UNTRAINED WESTERN EYE, MIGHT APPEAR AS DRUNKENNESS. GO, BABY ! WILD JUNGLE WOMAN. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE. I'D DO HER. OWW ! HA HA ! LOOK AT THIS ! WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR ? I WASN'T TALKIN' ABOUT YOU. LIFE OF THE SHELMIKEDMU WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT. SHAKE IT, BABY ! SHAKE IT ! EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE ON THE LARRY SWIFT SHOW, JAMES. IT'S A GREAT HONOR, I KNOW, BUT-- LOOK, SIMON, I NEED YOU TO DO THIS FOR ME. BUT THE SHELMIKEDMU, THAT'S YOUR BABY. WHY DON'T YOU APPEAR ON THE SHOW YOURSELF ? I WOULD, BUT I TOLD YOU I HAVE TO FLY HOME FOR MY BROTHER'S FUNERAL. BUT I'M CONCERNED, JAMES. I DO NOT SPEAK SHELMIKEDMU. YOU'LL BE FINE. JUST FOLLOW THE NOTES. LOOK, I'M GONNA BE LATE FOR MY FLIGHT. THE UTABAJI'S GONNA BE HERE ANY SECOND. YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY. GO, GO, GO. I'M GOING TO DO THIS FOR YOU. IT WILL BE AN HONOR. I'M ASHAMED I SUPPORTED RUTH WHEN SHE LEFT FOR NEW GUINEA TO DISCREDIT YOU. WHEN WAS THAT ? LAST TUESDAY. AND NOW BACK TO THE LARRY SWIFT SHOW. CAMERA TWO. WELCOME BACK. WE'RE HERE DISCUSSING THE AMAZING DISCOVERY OF DR. JAMES KRIPPENDORF. UNFORTUNATELY, A DEATH IN HIS FAMILY MEANS HE COULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT, BUT WE HAVE THE HELP OF HIS COLLEAGUE SIMON ALONSO. HELLO, SIMON. HELLO, LARRY. AND WELCOME, CHIEF KAWANAKAPI. A TRADITIONAL SHELMIKEDMU GREETING. OH. HAMASS ! HAMAMASS ! THEY MUST GO THROUGH QUITE A FEW TABLES WHERE HE COMES FROM. UH, WHAT IS HE SAYING, SIMON ? UM-- YOU KNOW, LARRY, I-- LARRY, I-- WAIT A SECOND. MY PRODUCER IS TELLING ME-- OH, WE HAVE FOUND AN EXPERT, SOMEONE WHO IS FLUENT IN SHELMIKEDMU. - YOU DID ? - YES, AND HERE SHE IS NOW. PROFESSOR VERONICA MICELLI, A COLLEAGUE OF YOURS AT BOUNDERBEE UNIVERSITY. HI, PROFESSOR MICELLI. SHELMIKEDMU. SHELMIKEDMU. HI. NICE TO SEE YOU, ALONSO. YOU CAN GO. UH, NO, I PROMISED PROF. KRIPPENDORF-- GO ! I HAVE TO GO, LARRY. PROFESSOR, YOU'RE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SHELMIKEDMU ? THAT'S RIGHT, LARRY. ACTUALLY, IN ANTHROPOLOGICAL CIRCLES I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING BUT REPLACE PROF. KRIPPENDORF... AS TH EXPERT ON THE SHELMIKEDMU. NOT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM HIS STUDIES, OF COURSE, AS INCONCLUSIVE AS THEY ARE. NOW THE SHIT-AH HIT-AH DA FAN-AH. COULD YOU ASK THE CHIEF HIS INITIAL IMPRESSIONS OF THE UNITED STATES ? OH, SURE. UH-- YOU-AH... BITCH. MMM. HE SAYS IT'S A VERY LARGE AND FRIGHTENING COUNTRY, FULL OF THINGS HE THOUGHT EXISTED ONLY IN MYTH. AND HE SAID THAT IN ONLY THREE SYLLABLES ? IT'S A VERY CONCISE LANGUAGE. SADLY, THIS IS THE CHIEF'S FINAL APPEARANCE IN AMERICA. HE FLIES HOME TONIGHT. WELL, THAT MAKES THIS VISIT VERY SPECIAL INDEED. COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN HIS COSTUME FOR US ? GLADLY. I GUESS THE MOST OBVIOUS ORNAMENT TO THE WESTERN EYE WOULD BE THIS PENIS SHEATH. UM, ITS INTENTION IS TO INTIMIDATE OPPOSING TRIBES. NOW, INTERESTINGLY, MY RESEARCH HAS PROVEN... THAT THE SIZE OF THE MAN'S SHEATH IS IN DIRECT CONTRAST... TO THE SIZE OF-- LET'S JUST SAY, THE BIGGER THE SHEATH... THE SMALLER THE-- OBVIOUSLY. NOW, PROFESSOR, WHAT IS THE CHIEF DOING NOW ? THIS WOULD BE A SIGN OF AFFECTION... AMONGST THE SHELMIKEDMU. - PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING WE DO HERE. - UH-HUH. NOW, THIS ACT OF THE CHIEF CALLS FOR THE REQUISITE RESPONSE FROM THE WOMAN. AAAAH ! In "Shelmikedmu," SO, UH, I KNOW THIS MAY SEEM VIOLENT TO THE VIEWERS, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THE CHIEF IS VERY USED TO THIS. OR, AT LEAST, HE SHOULD BE. NOW, AFTER SUCH A DISPLAY OF AFFECTION IT IS VERY COMMON TO GIVE AN OFFERING OF GIFTS. JUST SO HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME GIFTS RIGHT HERE. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, PROFESSOR ? WELL, RIGHT HERE I HAVE A LOVELY SELECTION... OF STINK SLUGS AND SEGO GRUBS. IT'S A DELICACY FOR THE SHELMIKEDMU. AH, SEE. HE'S LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE. - HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, CAN HE EAT ONE RIGHT HERE ? - OH, OF COURSE HE CAN. I'LL JUST GET A NICE, BIG, SLIMY ONE. IT'LL FLY RIGHT DOWN. LET'S SEE HERE. OKAY. HERE WE GO. CAN WE GET A CLOSE-UP OF THAT ? SURE ! CAMERA ONE. HE SAYS HE CAN'T WAIT TO EAT IT. OH, BE MY GUEST. ALL RIGHT. DOWN-DAH HATCH-AH. EAT-AH, PUKE-AH. FASCINATING, ISN'T IT ? AND THE PART WHERE YOU SLAPPED EACH OTHER ? THAT WAS SO RAD. OH, YEAH. I ENJOYED THAT PART TOO. SEE YA. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ? WHAT ? OUT OF MY MIND ? YOU LIED TO EVERYONE. YOU FALSIFIED RESEARCH. YOU MISAPPROPRIATED GRANT MONEY. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU HAVEN'T DONE ? NO-- HEY ! LET ME SEE. EATING A GRUB ON NATIONAL TELEVISION. THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP PRETTY GOOD. HEY. GREAT SHOW. THANKS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MOGO WACACA. HAVE A GOOD DAY. WHEN DID YOU FIGURE THIS OUT ? OH, GEE, LET ME SEE. MAYBE WHEN I SAW THE WALL OF SEX AT THE TV STORE. THEY DID EVERYTHING BUT SELL POPCORN ! ALL RIGHT ! I'M SORRY ! I DID AN AWFUL THING TO YOU, BUT YOU GOT YOUR REVENGE. BARELY. OH ! YOU MADE A FOOL OUT OF ME. OHH ! WE'RE EVEN, ALL RIGHT ? I AM ON THAT TAPE, TOO, REMEMBER ? I AM THE ONE HOLDING UP THE PLANK MEASURING HOW MANY PIGS MY BREASTS ARE WORTH. OKAY, OKAY, LOOK. I'LL TELL THEM THAT I GOT YOU DRUNK. I'LL TELL THEM I SEDUCED YOU. OH, GREAT ! EVEN BETTER. NOW I'M AN IDIOT AND A COCONSPIRATOR. WHOO ! WHY DID YOU TELL LARRY SWIFT THAT I WAS LEAVING ? BECAUSE ONCE WE SEND THIS CHARACTER BACK TO WHEREVER HE CAME FROM, NO ONE CAN PROVE A THING; WE'RE SAFE. OH, REALLY ? RUTH ALLEN IS IN NEW GUINEA, EVEN AS WE SPEAK, LOOKING FOR THE SHELMIKEDMU. SHE WENT THERE ? I DARED HER TO GO, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THE WOMAN WOULD DO IT. - WHAT ? YOU-- - OOPS-- NO, UH-- NO BIG DEAL. TRIBES DIE OFF ALL THE TIME. THEY GET WIPED OUT BY A VOLCANO OR A VIRUS, NEVER TO BE HEARD OF AGAIN. YOU WANNA KNOW WHO'S NEVER TO BE HEARD FROM AGAIN ? PEOPLE WHO UNDERESTIMATE RUTH ALLEN. IT'S GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY-- VERONICA. WAIT THERE A SECOND ! THE PROXMIRE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR YOU ALL DAY ! ME ? THEY HAVE ? THEY ARE RENEWING JAMES' GRANT... SO HE CAN CONTINUE HIS WORK ON THE SHELMIKEDMU. MRS. PROXMIRE HERSELF WILL PRESENT THE CHECK TO JAMES... AT A BIG GALA WEDNESDAY EVENING. HERE'S THE BEST PART. THE UTABAJI IS GOING TO BE THE GUEST OF HONOR. THAT'S WONDERFUL ! DID JAMES HAPPEN TO MENTION THAT HE OFFICIALLY MADE ME HIS PARTNER ? CONGRATULATIONS ! OH. YES. DID YOU KNOW THAT ? NO. COULD MEAN GOING TO JAIL. NO, IT MEANS MORE RECOGNITION. RECOGNITION ? RECOGNITION IS THE LAST THING I WANT ! I AM NOT TAKING THE GRANT. OH, YES, YOU ARE. HALF THAT MONEY IS MINE. I EARNED IT. YOU ARE INSANE. DID YOU KNOW THAT ? AND HOW DOES JAMES KRIPPENDORF GO TO A PARTY WITH HIM ? HUH ? GO IN AND GET THE KIDS. ME ? WELL, I CAN'T GO IN DRESSED LIKE THIS, CAN I ? HUH ? SON OF A BITCH !

GOD, YOUR PARENTS MUST HAVE LOVED YOU SO MUCH... FOR THEM TO TAKE YOU ALONG WITH THEM. - IS THAT RIGHT ? - OH, BELIEVE ME. WHEN THEY DON'T LOVE YOU, THEY JUST PACK THEIR BAGS AND SAY, "SORRY, VERONICA, HONEY. THIS TRIP'S JUST FOR US GROWNUPS. HELL WOULD FREEZE OVER BEFORE WE'D TAKE YOU." HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

AND MY BROTHER MICKEY... WILL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. WELL, YES, UM, THE REASON WHY... PROFESSOR ALLEN WAS NOT ABLE TO LOCATE THE SHELMIKEDMU-- I-IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.

THIS-- THESE CHILDREN ARE PART OF THE CONSPIRACY. THIS TRIBE IS A FRAUD ! - IT'S NOT A FRAUD ! THERE HAS TO BE A SHELMIKEDMU TRIBE, BECAUSE IF THERE ISN'T WE WON'T HAVE FUN ANYMORE...
