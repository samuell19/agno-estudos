In here, Cody. Moving or stationary? Moving. Oh! God damn it, you hooligan. See ya next week, John. I can hardly wait. Oh wow, great man! Peg, you got this car really runnin' good. What was the time? We did a 1:07! Way to go baby, good driving, good luck. Look at this car, bill. This car is the tits. Well? What do you think, Cody? They're dynamite. I meant the driving. Both of 'em. The driving and the body, they're dynamite. You really are horseshit at showing emotions, but I like that in a man, mm? Yeah. Eh, did you get some good pictures? You bet I did, Cody. All right, take it easy. You, too. - And you, woman. - Mm. Rodney, that cowboy sure can drive. June, I'll be he can. I'm just testin' my new little tape recorder I got. They say all private investigators need one so they can keep a record of their daily routines. I hope my days are never routine. Like today, I went out and watched my old friend June khnockers, spelled with an h, test her race car. God, she's got some great moves. Started at the pistol range. I went over and hit the target. At least I hit the board that held the target. Just pullin' up to the Marina now, where I reside. Well, that's it, 10-four, adios, over and out, good buddy. Cody, as you know, we're on the yacht club committee, and the fact that you have brought this most obtrusive thing here is beyond our comprehension. You must get rid of it as soon as possible. Now Doug, as you and the committee all know, my daddy founded this yacht club more than 25 years ago. My daddy and I also built this, and my mama, god rest her soul. It can't be torn down not just yet, anyway. Hey come on, my daddy's representing this yacht club in the transpac. Well Cody, he'd do a lot better if he didn't have an all-girl crew. He's been lost four times in six days. What's he doin' out there? All-girl crew? Probably just got blown off course. He always was a rather eccentric young man. Mama was afraid of airplanes and boats, but she loved trains. She was killed last year when a private rail car jumped the track, so in her memory, daddy and I painted a picture of a caboose and put it up in front of our boat. God, I hope that's a cigarette lighter. Oh. Hi, I'm may, and this is my friend, Faye. We just arrived from corpus christi on my daddy's boat. We're in the slip next to you, and since we're gonna be here for a while, we thought we might like to get to know you just a little bit better. We think it's the neighborly thing to do. We didn't think you were ever gonna get outta the shower. Well, how'd you girls get by my security system? We have our ways. Ooh-wee, I must be livin' right to have these lovelies pullin' into the slip right next door. You know, we haven't got our water hooked up yet, and we was wonderin' if maybe may and I could come over and take a shower here oh, you poor ladies, let's see what I can do for you. It's right down here. We've got a problem. The Russians are five years behind us in computer knowledge yet they're stealing our stuff right out from under us. How? First, they tried to buy some banks in the San Francisco area, to upend the computers and chips. When that didn't work, they set up industrial fronts to buy all the best computers. They send them to friendly nations, and then, then the Russians pay enormous amounts of money to obtain them from our so called allies. There are entire companies here that do nothing but this. We're coming down on them just as fast as we can. So what does that have to do with me? I was having a wonderful vacation in the south of France. We've traced one of the major operations to a dear old friend of yours. Lady Lillian Chamberlain. I don't believe... We wanna get somebody in there and check out what's going on, but I can't be you. You're too close to lady Chamberlain and the household. No one should suspect anything. Who else could do the job? Oh, I have someone in mind. In fact, I was with him earlier today at the yacht club. I think you'll be impressed. Name's Cody abilene. > I'm in love with the girl in the centerfold j» > in playboy magazine j > she's got to be the prettiest girl j» d that I think I've ever seen j > just look at that smile and look at blouse j» hey, here's your towel. > While she's lyin' down there in the grass » > I'm in love with the girl in the centerfold j» > in playboy magazine j > there's some writin' on the pages j > says her father is a preacher j» j» her mother is a doctor and she's a school teacher jb » and I'll bet she knows an awful lot about the golden rule j» Cody, Cody, Cody.

He wants me to see some European contessa named Luciana and get to know her. He says she's good lookin'. Good evening, Cody, please come in. Contessa, hope I'm not late. You could never be too late call me Luciana. Douglas wilton has told me all about you. I hope I can come up with a few surprises, like this one. Oh, thank you.

You think your car's fast, wait till you see what this one's... 30 years ago at Charlotte, my daddy beat ol' pl buffington here in a stock car race. He's been mad at our whole family ever since. He's got Doreen, his fat wife, his boy bobo here in a feud now. Pl's just dyin' to have his boy beat me in a race every chance he gets. Beat you all over the road, that's... All right, where do you wanna go do this? Fox canyon, just follow us down. Yeah. - See you at fox canyon. - Ha-ha! Come on, boy! You gonna lose it now. Hey Cody, me and my car's gonna get you, boy!

But don't it hurt the car? Yeah, runs like hell for 20 seconds, then it blows up. It was worth it, boy. That's right, we beat you, Cody! Hey Cody, how's it going? Hey Mitch. Take a look at this car, and tell me how come a four-banger just blew me off the road. Sure, no problem. Hey, Cody. So how's my daddy's olds goin'? It's comin' good. It should be done in a day or two. You're really gonna like this sucker. We'll deliver it over to your yacht. Got anything I can use in the meantime? Well, I got this old black Ford over here. Keys are in it. Okay. Oh, uh, there are a couple bags in the delorean. - I'll get 'em for ya. - Thanks. Well, I'm still headin' for bel air, to the home of lady Lillian Chamberlain. Contessa I uciana's father and lady Lillian were lovers in Europe several years back. They're still friends. Luciana moved to this country from Italy and has remained close to lady Chamberlain. Lady Chamberlain wants me to stay at the house for a few days just to check things out. Bel air has nothing but rolls royces, Mercedes, Cadillacs, feraris. So I pull up in this borrowed Ford, but hell, with my sophisticated style, good looks, nobody's gonna pay any attention to what I'm drivin" Howdy. Cody abilene, lady Lillian's expecting me. Come on in, you're late. Nice car She's out by the pool, follow me. Luciana told me lady Lillian had broke her leg in a skiing accident. She'll be in this wheelchair for about three more months. Mr. abilene, how very nice to see you again. Lady Lillian, you're lookin' wonderful. Thank you. Shane, bring in Mr. abilene's bags. You got a real charmer, there. People say I'm crazy, but I just know there's something going on in this house behind my back. My nephew Stuart, his wife, Anita, and my niece, Liza, all ive here with me since they're parents were killed in an accident. Then, of course, there's Shane, you met him, and my maid, Marian. She's a friend of Shane's, wait till you see her. She is really off the wall. Oh, baby, mm. Mm, so my much better than tennis. Shane, Shane, where the hell are you? Damn it, I'm late. I gotta get back to the house. Shane Reeves, god damn it! Oh, somebody oughta take that bullhorn and. Ouch! What if that leaves a Mark. Don't worry, Mrs. Chamberlain. Your husband'll never see it Shane. What did a guy like you do in jail? Ate a lotta furniture, baby. Shane, meet us in the living room. Cody, would you please take me to the living room? It's that way. Yes ma'am. Oh, there you are, Anita. Shane, where have you been? Make sure the cook knows Mr. abilene will be here for dinner. Yes, lady Lillian. Darling, Anita, come here. This is Cody abilene. Cody, this is my nephew's wife. My pleasure, ma'am. Cody will be staying with us for a few days. How nice I'd finally get a chance to meet the Chamberlain family. I don't know where that child is Liza's comin' down in a minute. I said hello earlier to Anita's husband, Stuart Chamberlain. He's okay, I guess. He seems a little light in his loafers, though. Oh Liza, there you are. You're late dear, we had to start without you. Liza, this is Cody abilene. Cody is our house guest. I noticed your car. Really nice. Yeah well, I like to drive. I just bet you do. Cody, do you cook? Mm, not much. Well what do you usually make for dinner? Reservations very good. The Chamberlain family is an odd mixture to say the least. I had to leave right after dinner because twice a week, I meet with my lady cop friend, sergeant Beverly mcafee for a workout. Usually we go dancing and playing afterwords. Tonight, she's gotta go back to work, though. Damn this place is filled with great-lookin' bodies. Exercise is okay, but girl-watchin's what I do best. I love lookin' at that gorgeous Diana, hoo. The luscious lorette, oh my, and the outrageously sexy Peggy. Beverly's still one of my favorite ladies, though. Don't they ever give you the night off, Beverly? Nine to five looks so good right now. No one ever told you bein' a cop would be easy. Hey Luke, take a look at that chump over there. Yeah I know, she's into the little boys, I don't know what she see in them, she need to get herself a real man. Well, I see we got a couple of new show offs workin' out. Wonder how things are workin' out back at the Chamberlain place. Shane, what the hell are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? - Get away from me! - Come on. Relax baby, come on. - Ow. - Come on. Come on baby, oh yeah. Come on, Liza. Yeah, that's it. Mm. Thanks a lot, I enjoyed it. Damn you, Shane, you son of a bitch! Stuart. Stuart, what are you looking at? Uh, nothing, I thought I heard something. Ah, times crossword puzzle. Can I help you with a word? Ah, you don't mind if I join you, do you? This is a great day. You know, you don't have to be nice to me. Oh, I insist on it. Us Texas boys are known for it. That's really some bullshit. Thank you, maid Marian. How about some lunch? We have some escargot. Snails, no thanks. I make it a point never to eat anything that leaves a trail. Of all days to be stuck here. My Mercedes is in the shop, and I really need to get to palm Springs. How about Shane the chauffeur? Forget that son of a bitch. Well can I drive you where you're going? Sure, why not? Shane's probably slipping it to Anita anyway. I believe you texans call it layin' pipe. They get it on at the beach house. You know about that, don't you? Oh yeah. Oh, you're the greatest baby, mm. Oh yeah. Oh, that's it, mm. Oh yeah, mm, oh baby. Mm, delicious. We're late baby, come on, we gotta get goin'. So uh, what's your friend's name? Johnathon Harper, he's in computers. He buys and sell 'em worldwide. You know, a lot of people have been caught sellin' those illegally to communist countries. I assume he's legitimate. Johnathon's reputation is fine with me. I'm investing in his company. Besides, I only asked you for a ride, not your opinion. Oh, okay. Shane. Shower time. Come on in. Hey baby, you're too much. I'll meet you in the car. There's Johnathon Harper's building, Cody. Jay, the new computers are coming in next week, and I want you to have a look at those, also. Yes sir, Mr. Harper. Hi Liza, darling, how are you? This is Cody abilene, he drove me here. My Mercedes broke down. Your car is always breaking down. Well, that's the way it goes. Cody, my name is Johnathon Harper. - Howdy. - How do you do? Liza, have you got the financing we talked about? Yes, I do. Thank you. Hey, what about the other night, hey, ho. - Hey. - Oh yeah. - How's it goin'. - Look at those legs. - What do we have here? - Look at the face. Oh, look at this body, veah, great lookin' guy. Cool it. The lady's an investor. - Investor. - Hey look, Liza. I think we've seen enough of these gentlemen. Let's get outta here. No, I'm staying, I have business to discuss. Suit yourself. Liza, these are three of my friends, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. They're here to help us. Do me a favor, wait over there for a few minutes, darling. I'll be right with you. - Okay. - Okay? See to it that his ass leaves these premises. Yeah, and the rest of his body, too. Hey you, why don't you pull over for a sec? I gotta talk to you. That's okay, I can find my own way. If you don't pull over, I'm gonna fuckin' put you over. He's a pretty boy, isn't he? What, you lookin' to fuck 'em? Yeah, maybe, yeah. Guys, guys. Fuck, you don't wanna mess with me. You see this body? This body is a lethal weapon. I could kill you guys in a second. I'll show you lethal weapons. Oh, shit. Hi-yal! Yah! Lethal weapon my ass. Pick his ass up. - Turn the thing. - You see this, huh? How do you like this, longhorn? How do you feel without a dick, huh? Get outta here. You wouldn't happen to have a loaner, would you? - Happy trails! - Yeah, happy trails! - Yeah go for it. - You got it. Yoo-hoo! We're only kidding. No seriously, come on back! Yah! Let's get, let's get outta here, come on, let's go. I need the fastest thing on this lot. Sugar, I'm the fastest thing on this lot. Oh, mercy. Come back real soon, you hear? Yeah, right. Boy, that was really a horseshit trip to palm Springs. I got my ass whipped, my borrowed car shot up, and I was raped. You know, time to see just what the hell is goin' on around here. Sure Shane, you can screw around with this thing for as long as you want, but I'm here to tell ya, asshole, your health, ya dig, your health, it's gonna suffer. You can bet the whole goddamn farm on that, pal. - I'll pay. - When? When I got it. Hey Shane. You still messin' around with that broad you work for? Well maybe you'll pay up pretty soon, eh? Remember, you owe us 30 grand. - Well? - Well I owe a guy some money, he's being a nuisance, that's all. How stupid to let your scuzzy gambling friends call you here. Come here, baby. To hell with you. Maybe it'd be all right to have some things said about you. What said about me? Get your hand off me. I don't know, like maybe something about this rich lady, an ex-con has been living in her house? Right, the house man. And what's been going on right under her queer hubby's little turned up faggot nose. I got some state of the art video on you, baby. I also got some pictures you oughta see. Ooh, here's some with you on top. You filthy, no good, son of a bitch. Bastard! I wasn't gonna show 'em to anybody. Your husband doesn't know anything. I'm not stupid, Shane. Anita baby, come here. I hope to hell the gamblers get you, Shane, and I hope they tear you in little bits. You little whore Okay Shane, let's go, and take me to the club. Shane is driving Stuart in the Chamberlain limousine. I'm following them along the sunset strip. I heard just enough outside of Shane's room to make me wonder what the hell else he's up to. Well, they're makin' a u-turn and stoppin' across the street. I'm really surprised an ex-con would assume my morals to be an issye. How very naive of you, Shane. You can only get away so long with performing here for kicks. I'll take my chances. You'll have a better chance to continue playing queen for a day if you help me out. I need 30 big ones right away. Why, that's blackmail. How would you like to go back to prison for another five years? Wouldn't this be cute of us in the faggot gazette? That's you on the bottom, sweets. Suppose I were to take this threat seriously, which I don't for a minute, to whom would I entrust the money? Me, of course. Tomorrow night at lady Lillian's charity party. Doesn't leave us much time, does it? But then why should I keep you in suspense? The answer is no, now drive me to the entrance. Shane's pullin' the limo in front of the screaming cockatoo. This should be good. - Hi. - Stuart, you look wonderful. Thank you, I feel good. I don't believe this one Stuart has just turned into the most gorgeous woman. Love that dress! Thank you. You like, huh? Yeah, you have great legs, love it. Thank you, what a day I had. - Really? - Let me tell you about it. Come on. - Tell me. I knew he was different, but wow. Do me a favor, Frederick, please, don't forget to come to lady Chamberlain's tomorrow. It's very important. Oh, I don't, Stuart. I'm gonna have to work, but I'll definitely be there. Thank you. Here's to it. Goodies on a tray. Hors d'oeuvres? What an assortment under one roof. Lady Chamberlain thinks I'm here to check on her family. Luciana has me involved in espionage. God, I love intrigue. God, I love Luciana's white dress. Let's have some champagne and toast my art-selling trip tomorrow. I'll toast, but I better stay alert tonight. Can I have some designer water? You are continental. Well, have a safe flight. Let's toast to us bein' together tonight. You know, we have worldwide computer investments for those people who've trusted us with their finances. We've made enormous profits for them. Things look even better in the future. You know, Johnathon, I think your interest in our little Liza here is something just a bit more than financial Luciana, I mean contessa. Would you like some champagne? You know that snake? I spent a few days with lady Lillian last month. He was around then - cheese? - Hey Tommy, look who we got here, it's maid Marian. You look very foxy tonight, maid Marian. Just because we all work for Johnathon doesn't mean you creeps can put your hands on me. Ho-ho-ho. Hello, Shane. Hello, dick. What are you doin' here? We control the catering service here, you know that. I'm here to collect the bread you owe us, remember? Yeah well time's runnin' out, asshole. I'll see ya later. Stuart Chamberlain, please. Yes, it's very important. Tell him it's Frederick calling. You have a telephone call. Thank you. Hello? Hello, Stuart? Did you forget about our date tonight? Of course not, Frederick, darling. Where are you? This is Shane, Stuart darling. Remember tonight's the night. I need that money. I told you, you thieving bastard, I said no, and I meant it. Faggot. You like that, lover boy, hm? It's like you've been avoiding me all evening. Now you come up with the bread, or guess who's dead. Now listen, asshole, I'm not leaving here tonight without the money. Now you get it up, or I'm gonna cut your fuckin' face. Don't cut me, please, please. You understand? Yeah tonight, tonight. Oh, damn it. That son of a bitch. That bitch maid Marian, she is something else. Did you hear that she got raped this afternoon by two homosexuals. One held her down, and the other one did her hair. Hors d'oeuvre, Mr. Chamberlain? Slut. Good night, thank you for coming. Oh, you rascal. Good night, good night. Thank you, Luciana. Thank you, Lillian. Good seeing you. Good night, Cody. Shane, come here. Dead tired, please take me to my room. Yes, lady Lillian. Hi, this is Regis philbin, along with my wife, joy. Tonight's program is about love. The whole world depends on, on love. Exactly, and I think people should respect each other's feelings. Oh, if you have that respect. I have some love for ya, Regis and joy. But it's really the love that engenders that respect. Thattaway to go, baby. Stuart better show up with that money. Dick's gonna be here soon, and he's not gonna wait much longer for that dough. Damn it, what am I gonna do? You know, we were talking about love the other day, and I guess I can't forget some of the things that were expressed here about relationships and about how people really should feel about one another. Men and women, men and men. Everybody should have that basic love for one another, it's so important. I think you're right. Where there's no Sincere feeling of love. As a matter of fact, I think it's the lack of love that's killing us all today. To relate to each other after all, love is what makes the world go 'round. Ah, I feel great today. I feel hot. I'l drink to that What's that? Well Shane, you win some, you lose some. Poor Shane. Luciana, the plane leaves in a couple hours. I want you to get outta here. I'll vouch for you, we were together all night. I'd rather stay here with you. I'm worried don't worry, I can take care of this. You really don't wanna get involved, I have to call the police now. You take of yourself. Looks like he was shot, stabbed, and still made it out here. Sure was tough sum' bitch. Hey, what's goin on in his room? Anita? What the hell are you doin' here? I don't know I don't know, I. I just came in through the service entrance, I saw blood is it Shane? Everything's such a mess, I just got here. It's a shock, I guess. Go in the house, tell everybody to meet me by the pool. Go, do it! Let's see, I saw Shane put those pictures of Anita in one of these drawers. Well, they ain't here now. Hm, there's blood on this camera. Looks like it's got some exposed film in it. I better check this out The killer must've jimmied these drawers open. Hm Oh, this is a terrible thing. Shane was such a good driver. And though I'm sorry, I feel as though it's my fault. I wouldn't say that when the police get here. But I was the one that hired him I know what you meant. Fxcuse me. - Uh-huh. - I just can't wait to see. Oh baby, the sound of your voice is drivin' me crazy. I tell you baby, I'm only as a beer can, but I'm real long, you know? - Oh god. - I know what you mean. Oh murder, when you get hot, you let your husband watch, it makes me very crazy. Hi Sally, it's Cody abilene, you got anything for me? Cody, you sexy, gorgeous cowboy. Cody, tell me what you're wearing. I bet you're wearing those sexy, tight jeans. I'd love to have you here. You're too much Cody, I want you so bad. I wanna feel your manhood pressed against me, oh. - I understand. - Baby. I want you so bad right now. Okay look, I'll get back to you on that, all right? You sexy man. Your tongue would really enjoy being on me. My nipples are even hard just talking to you. Get on the horn and get the police over here to the Chamberlain house as soon as possible. It's a homicide god, I wish you could come through this phone right now. Yeah look, just call the police, all right? I'll talk to you later. Did you learn anything, Cody? Yes ma'am, I sure did. I'm gonna go take a cold shower now. The police'll be here in about five minutes. Y'all wait right here. The police could have me thrown in jail for withholding evidence, but I wanna be the first to see this film when it's developed. I better hide this goodie before they get here. Some layout. Yeah it. Arledge, Beverly. Cody aveline. I should've known you'd be involved in this. Come on in, I'll show you the way. How well do you know this guy? Oh, pretty well. Well, I know him very well. Don't let that cowboy charm fool you. He graduated summa cum laude from Texas university. Everyone standby. Chamberlain family, this is it. Arledge. How do you do? - Sergeant mcafee. - Hello. Morning. Lady Chamberlain, this arrived in my office this morning. It's for you. Oh, thank you. Oh my. Uh, they're with you. Taken with Shane. How cozy. Take them, it. Arledge. Uh, can I take a look at these? Nice composition. A little out of focus. It's what we call hard evidence they were taken at the beach house. How could you, Anita? Lady Lillian gave him a key to the beach house. When? Uh-huh, mm-hm. He left with the lady cop, oh, about 20 minutes ago. Okay. Well, maybe we'll find something at the Chamberlain beach house. Lt. Arledge thinks Stuart did it. Oh yeah, how come? Those pictures of Shane and Anita we saw a while ago. That's a pretty strong motive, don't you think? Yeah, I guess. He had the opportunity, but so did a lot of other people. Fun little playhouse. Interesting place. What do you hope to find here? Clues. Pictures, electronics. But you know me. I just like to cover all the angles. Oh yes. Speaking of angles, have I told you how good you've been lookin' since you've been goin' to the gym? Well no, but I'm glad you noticed. Of course, I, uh, haven't had a chance to take in the whole thing. Well, aren't you in for a treat? So are you. Oh really? Top this. I'll give it my best shot. Hey, you wanna see a home movie of us? Oh, sure Cody. You won't believe what I found. A remote control for a video camera. And when did you find that? I'd rather not say. Talk about a soap opera. We should have our own show looks like Shane the photographer set this up. Sure was a good ol' boy. I got all day for this. The shit-kickin' private eye, a hag, and and a roll of film. I'll take that. It's my case. When it's murder, the police take control. Besides, I paid for it with my very own body. And you were worth every frame of it. Well, thank you kindly, ma'am. Piece of cake. Let's go, Tommy. Did you just hear somethin' outside? Shower, check it out. I'll cover us outside Go ahead, go for it. Make my day. Watch out! Oh! Go for it? Make my day? Are you serious? Careful now, Beverly. There's still one out there Cody, the door. There he is. - He's mine. Jesus, stay stay, I got him. God damn. Look out, Beverly! Oh. Hey, I coulda hit him. Oh really? All right, it's these hands. They're the lethal weapons. Yeah, just be careful when you play with yourself. So, who knew we were coming out here? I almost hate to say. Lady Lillian? You got it. Damn it damn it okay. I'll call the lieutenant over at the Chamberlain house and tell him what happened here. Okay. Look, if you can handle the calvary, I'll go to my boat and get a couple things done. Okay. Call my service if you need me. Cody? I need a kiss You gonna be okay? I'll be fine. Beverly's right. Who else knew we were comin' out here? Could lady Lillian be a suspect? Nah on my way back to the Marina, I stopped by the grocery store to get me a peanut brittle candy bar. I just need to think things through. Hey! Hey, there you are, Cody! Oh, no. Not the buffington family again. Come on, let's go! What's wrong, you yellow? I don't wanna race you guys! - Chicken, you're chicken! - Come on. All I have is this junked out old Datsun z. It wouldn't even be fair. Fair? You want fair, go to church, boy. Come on, let's go, come on, I'm ready, let's go! Come on! I picked this car 'specially just to race you. So, you ready? Watch this, watch this, Cody. Huh, hey, how 'bout that, huh? All right, come on! - Damn. Now they even got a low-rider. Come on, boy! Come on, bobo, come on boy, get 'em! Yeah, boy, we win! Yeah, look at this! Once again, I've been disgraced by the buffingtons. I'm rapidly losing face. If I don't whip their butts next time, my daddy's gonna whip mine. Be careful.

Listen Cody, the lieutenant just arrested Stuart Chamberlain for Shane's murder. He found some pictures of Stuart and Shane together. Listen Beverly, I got somethin' to tell ya. I found another roll of film there over in Shane's dresser before you came over. You held that out on me? Yeah, well it was my case first. Well, it's not your case any longer, cowboy. I sure would like to get that film developed. Do you really think the film's that important? No question about it. They tried killin' us for it yesterday, and I was told by a couple of reliable sources that they were still lookin' for it last night. Cody, are you alone? No, there's a topless girl serving me coffee and a beautiful dancing girl with batons. Get serious Beverly, of course I'm alone. I sure would like to know what's on that film. You've gotta get it developed. Yeah but knowing Shane, I don't think I wanna take it to the local drugstore. Listen, I got an idea, lemme call you right back. Sally's phone and lip service, may I help you? Yeah, good morning, Sally. Listen, can you give me June khnockers at Willow Springs? Cody, it's you, where are you? I'm on my boat.

Okay look, you're going back to Willow Springs, right? Give this to Beverly when you get there. Go to that general store down there, see if you can't pick me up a box of these, hollow tips, all right, a whole box. Can't I go with you? You and those were marvelous today, but I gotta go it alone, okay? Go get me those shells, now. Hello? Yeah, she's here, Beverly, it's for you. Is that you, Cody? Yeah, no I'll be okay, where are you? No, Cody, Cody, wait. Just wait for me to bring some back up, please. A little gift from Shane before he got knocked off. What do you think, Liza? 1 don't like it or your despicable friends. How dare you get me involved in this? I invest in your company, and you show me films of the jerk chauffeur making out with Anita? What's this all about, anyway? All right, everybody, this party's over! Now move out! Now! You and you, stay. What the fuck do you think you're doing? This 1s my home, and these are my clients. How dare you break in here? Sit down! Why? Why what? Why'd you kill Shane? I didn't kill anybody. You killed Shane. You don't have to listen to any of this. You, I don't like you very much, so you'd be doin' real good just to sit there and be a good ol' boy. Now shut up! The night of the party, you went into Shane's room. You not only stabbed him, but then you shot him, and then you made it look like your brother Stuart did it. You have no evidence this folder says I do. The hell is going on here? Lieutenant, just in time. And Beverly, it sure is good to see you up and around. It's hard to keep a good cop down. You wanna explain this to me, Cody? I think you'll find this quite interesting, lieutenant. Our little lady here. Has been quite busy. Damn you, Cody, what are you doin'? Will you get this off of me? I'll be damned. Here, take a look at this. Both I iza and Johnathon were arrested case closed, right? Not so, I'd made a mistake. The next morning, I invited everyone involved to meet me on my boat. Aw damn, not them again. We're gonna get you your pink slip this time, boy. Okay look, I feel it's only fair to warn you, though, this here's my daddy's car. He's got it all gussied up with power. We got your gussied up. My son here's a mechanical genius. We got a car just waitin' for ya over at the racetrack. Racetrack, are you guys serious? Well, hey daddy, it's just a little ol' Camaro, ain't nothin' special. That's right. Once again, you're gonna eat our dust. That's right. By all means then, lead the way. - Follow! - Follow us, come on! Don't touch the car, don't touch the car. - Ha! - Hey, al how's it goin'! You know, we'll beat 'em. First thing we're gonna do is blow Cody's doors off, then I'm gonna buy you a big chili and tamale breakfast oh, I don't eat stuff, nah. What I want's a filet mignon, cheese, and some champagne. Whatever you say, bean bag. What the hell did he say? - I don't know. - Here, let's line this thing up. - Yep! - Line 'em up. Gimme my helmet, mama! Give him his helmet. Come on, baby boy, come on, baby. You gotta have your helmet. Come on, wait a minute! Get in the car, it's over here, boy! Get in the car, be safe now, put on your seatbelt. - Bye. - Come on!

Look, look, my daddy would want you to have this. What'd he give you, daddy? It's a god damn silver bullet. You, get outta my sight! Don't bother my son! He cheated, he cheated, you cheater! Sally's phone and lip service, may I help you? Yeah babe, it's Cody. I just won my rocket race. Oh Cody, it's you. I love rockets I've seen your rocket, and it's big and beautiful. Sally, listen. What about those people I had you line up to meet me on the boat in a little while? I've called them Cody, what's your eta? I'm on my way there now. I would like to propose a toast to a young lady that we're all very happy to have with us here today. Liza, would you come out here? Do you believe this, Beverly? We just arrested her last night. What the hell's she doin' here? Lieutenant, what's the? You all know I iza certainly lieutenant and Beverly know Douglas f. Wilton, former district attorney and now high-ranking government official, and chairman of my daddy's yacht club committee. All right boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, get comfortable, and let me explain it to you. I'd been up all night long at the CIA building with Douglas wilton. By nine this morning, we'd gotten Liza released from jail. But three hours earlier, around six this morning, I was coming back from Willow Springs where I'd gone back to pick up my car. On the way back to my boat, I needed a cup of coffee. Damn if I didn't run into Peggy, one of the pretty girls from the health club. Hi Cody. - Peggy. - How are you? I can't complain. Coming to the gym today? Not today, pretty lady. I've been up all night workin'. Oh, I can get a big picture of that. Picture picture, that's it. That was the key, I had it all the time, right in front of me in black and white. I'd been chased so hard by those three animals I never really studied it. I thought it was Liza. This picture isn't Liza. How did you know it wasn't me? Well, I didn't hit me for a while. We all know that you're left-handed. Everything you do is with your left hand. Shane's drawer was pried open by a right-handed person. You could tell by the scratches. The killer in the picture Shane took was holding the gun in the right hand. It couldn't have been you, Liza. You ain't right-handed. But if it wasn't me, and it wasn't Stuart, who did kill Shane. I knew it had to be a woman because the height of the killer in the photo, and all the guys around here are over six feet tall couldn't have been the maid, 'cause I don't think she's smart enough to disguise herself. Anita was too drunk, lady Lillian had her leg in a cast. The only one left was Luciana. Luciana, but I thought she was with you. So did I after I left Peggy in the coffee shop, I went straight to contessa ll uciana's house. I figured that since she'd left town, I'd have to break in, but I didn't know it'd be this easy. She'd left me a key and a note telling me to go on in. I went on in, found another note telling me to play a tape recorder. This lady was way ahead of me. Cody, by the time you hear this, I'll be in Hawaii I knew you wouldn't let an innocent person go to jail. I did leave you some obvious clues, and I knew your analytical mind would eventually find them all. I remember the first time we made love. You were thirsty afterward, so the next time we made love at the Chamberlain house after the party, it was easy for me to give you a sleeping powder, and I went downstairs to Shane's room and killed him. I disguised myself as Liza in case I was spotted. Shane took a picture of me before he died. I purposely pried open his drawer from the right side, then I intentionally took the wrong camera. I counted on you to figure out that the person in the picture was not Liza. Shane was about to ruin the lives of people I love. He was also a traitor and a threat to our national defense. He was Johnathon Harper's courier to the Russians. I'm not just another pretty face. Of course, you will keep it confidential that I work for the government, specifically Douglas wilton. Douglas and I planned Shane's elimination. There are some things I can't tell you, but Luciana was investigating Johnathon Harper. Shane worked for Harper. They were selling computer secrets for the Russians. No one had been able to catch them Shane's murder brought in the police. The federal agents needed to do this to conceal their involvement the police, well they promptly arrested Stuart by mistake. Did Luciana send me those awful pictures, and why? To throw the blame on Stuart. I knew the pictures I sent of Shane with Anita plus the pictures the police found of Shane with Stuart would make Stuart the prime murder suspect and allow me time to get out of town. Lift the red cloth and you will see how I disguised myself as Liza. As you know, I'm an artist. I was able to make a mask similar to this one and wear it the night I killed Shane. It will melt in a matter of seconds. There will be no evidence - 1 don't believe it. - Except for your eyes only. As I mentioned, I'm in Hawaii. Two things are clear to me. One, I had you figured correctly. You're not only a very attractive man, but an intelligent one, also. And two, that you would help us get rid of Johnathon Harper. As soon as you can wrap up the situation, I want you and your body over here. I can't wait I'm counting the days. Ciao, Cody. Oh my. You see, Johnathon was convinced that Liza killed Shane because of the information he got from maid Marian. He sent those two outlaws to the Chamberlain beach house, and then the three stooges to my boat and the racetrack to try to kill me and get back the film. He wanted to protect Liza and her money. Funny thing is, if he had gotten a hold of that film, he would've blackmailed her for the rest of her life. Greed is such an awful thing. Between murder, blackmail, and selling computer secrets to our enemies, I think Johnathon's gonna be put away for a long, long time. I do wish Luciana hadn't killed Shane, it's such an inconvenience good help is so very hard to find, you know? Except where you're concerned, Cody. You're just a wonderful cowboy, why, you'd help any woman in distress, wouldn't you? Would I help any woman in distress? Yes ma'am, I would. Oh, Cody abeline.
