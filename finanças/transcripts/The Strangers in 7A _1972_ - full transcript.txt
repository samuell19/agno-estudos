[MUSIC PLAYING] -You know how long I've been waiting for this elevator? 10 minutes. What are we paying for anyway? -I'm sorry, Mrs. Layton. I'll get a serviceman right after the holidays. He certainly has grown. -Sure, come on, sweetie. Come on, honey. -Good morning, Miss Simpson. -Archie. -Artie, Artie, Miss Simpson, from the king. -Yes, of course, yes. -King Arthur and all the knights. -That you, Artie? -No, it's your high school sweetheart. -I never went to high school. You finished that job pretty quick. -Well, there's nothing to it once you get the hang of it. It doesn't exactly take a genius to fix a sink. How are you doing? You almost packed? -Just about. -Hey, Stu Shaw spoke to O'Leary's son at the shop. There's talk they'll put the graveyard shift back on. -That'll be great. -Yeah, I don't believe it either. It's probably just talk. I sure do miss the guys though. -Well, most of them are out of work. You're lucky you got this job. -Yeah. Call for a taxi? -Uh, huh. -Good. -Artie, I don't have go. I mean, my sister's always exaggerating her illnesses anyway. After all it's only bursitis. -No, it'll do you good to see her. Just do you good. You know, anyway, there's no point hanging around here with the heat and all. So just-- -OK. -Sure. -Oh, I almost forgot. This came for you special. -It's my correspondence course, Iris. How could you forget this? You know I've been waiting for it. Oh, yeah. What a setup. I can get a diploma with this thing. You listening, Iris? -Yeah. -When I finish up this, I'll be a mechanical engineer. I won't just be a super in a building anymore. Pretty good, huh? -Finish up. Artie, it's a correspondence course. It'll take ten years to finish. I mean, what good does a diploma do you at your age? After all, Artie, you're not young anymore. [CAR HORN HONKING] -Oh, there's your-- there's your cab. OK. -Artie, don't. Your back. I can carry it. -Well, listen, ah, say hi to your sister. And tell her about that hot towel thing for her arm. It worked like a miracle for Mrs. Morris in 2C. You know it's-- -Sure, I will. -Oh, yeah. -I'll call you as soon as I get there. -OK. And Artie, forget about the bar tonight. Huh? -Hmm. Bye, Iris. [TV SPORTSCASTER IN BACKGROUND] Say, Danny. -Old lady let you out, huh? -Yeah, a little vacation. -Beats having her around. -You said it. -What'll you have? -Oh, make it like always. Better start me with two. Who's fighting? -Oh, a couple of pitty pats. They'd be better off square dancing than fighting. -Yeah, I get me in some good shape, I'd like to go a couple of rounds with those old ladies. Not that I'm not in pretty good shape right now. -Been coming in the last three or four nights. -Look what I found. It's big. Is it real? -Oh, it's-- it's just a ring. -You mind if I join you? -No. -Hi. -Hi. A drink? Ah, you have one. -Yes, I do, don't I? My name's Claudine. -Artie, Artie Sawyer. -Good to meet you, Archie. -Artie, Artie, Arthur, like the president, Chester Alan Arthur. -Oh, yeah. -Claudine what? -Just Claudine. I don't have a last name. I mean, I don't have a last name I use at all. -That's just fine. That's fine. Just Claudine is nice enough. -It's pretty, isn't it? -Yes, it is. -My other name is such a drag. But I like Claudine. I mean, I look like a Claudine. Don't I? Don't you think I look like a Claudine? -Yes-- yes, you do, just like a Claudine. It's perfect. -It's not perfect. Nothing's perfect. -I-- I guess you're right. Nothing's-- nothing's really, really perfect. You're looking at my legs, weren't you? -No. Yeah. I didn't mean to bother. -You didn't bother me. And why should you bother me? That doesn't make any sense? I mean, If you think I'm pretty, why not look? Don't you think so? -Yeah, I sure do. Here's to it. -Anyway, that's how I make my living. Not like that. I'm an actress. I studied theater arts in school. -I'll be getting my diploma pretty soon. -I do off off-Broadway stuff now. I was in play. It closed a couple of nights ago. Same to you, Charlie, if you can afford it. Didn't wear anything. Did you see it? -I-- I go to the theater a lot. I missed that one. I've seen Hamlet. -East Village called it an incredible exercise in sensitivity and a great play to get off on. -Sensitivity sure is-- -Hmm? -I said sensitivity is good. -Yeah. Oh, daddy dear, the bar keep says you're the super down at an apartment building on Eighth. Is that right? -Oh, more like-- more like manager really. Super super is what I tell people. Super super. -Well, I think supers are underrated. I mean, you have to-- you have to know about furnaces, the big furnaces, electricity. It's like public relations or something. When someone moves in or out it must be some pain in the ass. -Oh, it's-- it's a lot of responsibility. Its'-- -Anybody move out recently? -We don't have any apartments for rent. -Ah, that's what I figured. My problem is that I don't have a place to sleep tonight. See, when the play closed I was supposed to get paid. But I didn't see a dime. So I guess I'm kind of stuck. -Don't you have any friends? -No, no relatives. No-- well, the friends I have-- I guess everyone has it tough these days. -What about a hotel? I mean, you've got enough money for a hotel? -No. I'll stick around here until closing time. I've got enough money for a couple of beers. And then I'll walk around. You look at this dress. I mean, I wish I had a longer dress. People get ideas, men and other strange people too. I don't know. I'll probably meet somebody that I like. I don't know. I'll probably meet somebody that's nice. -You can't-- you can't just walk around all night. -What am I supposed to do, hug? I mean if you had an apartment-- if you had a vacant apartment for one night. -There is this one empty apartment, but-- I got business in there. -I'm not going to mess anything up. -It's-- it's not really empty. I mean, just gone away for the weekend. -All I need is a bed. Ah, forget it. I've got the guts to find someone else. -Ah-- ah-- -Yes. -You say it's just-- it's just for one night? -Yeah, just for one night. -Gee, wouldn't do any harm. -I'll be as quiet as a mouse. Thank you. I'll make you feel good about it. I promise you. You slow down. -It wouldn't be good if one of my tenants saw us. Wouldn't be good. Wait right here. [PHONE RINGING] -Boo. -Don't do that. You're cute when you're scared. -Let's go. -Wait, hold the elevator. I'm not about to wait for this thing again. You're a good doggie. Mommy's little baby. This the new tenant? -If you mean me, I'm visiting. -Well, now. Visiting you, Artie? -How do I know who she's visiting? Your floor, Mrs. Leyton. -Hmm. -Why did you have to laugh like that. -Like what? Wow. Salters made it pretty good. -How did you know the Salters live here? -I don't know. Danny must have told me. -Who are you calling? I thought you didn't have any friends. -Just seeing what time it is. Great bed. I think an army could sleep in this bed. You an army? This is some place. You've got some class, Mr. Super Super. Hey, how come the air conditioner is broken. -It shouldn't be. -Yeah, well it is. Never mind. Let's work up a sweat. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] How long have you been married? -Who said I was? -A little birdie. I bet her name is Dorrie, Doris, or Joe or Iris. I'll bet this is your first time. -You're crazy. I've been around kids. -Around and around and around. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] -The absolute end. -Hi, Claudine. Is this the superintendent? -What is this? Some kind of joke? I'll have you all arrested for trespassing. What do you think you're doing? -Sitting on the couch with my girl. What did you think you were doing? Settle down, Mr. Super. Look, it's all very simple. We just need a place to stay for a couple of nights. So we decided to accept your hospitality. -Who invited you? -You invited Claudine. You tried to make it with my girl. How does adultery sound? Hm? I'll bet you Iris would love to meet Claudine. -How do you know about Iris? -Fair question. Artie Sawyer, age 46. Wife Iris, age 45. No children. Won a silver start in World War II. American Legion award winning, worked in an aircraft plant, blah, blah, blah. Here, superintendent of 327 building on Eighth Avenue. Frequents Danny's Pub, a local brewery, blah, blah, blah, blah. Says here you have a mole on your-- -Shut up. You're all crazy. -No, just thorough. Virge, here, used to work on New York's finest. Didn't you, Virge? -Oh, that's it. It's a gag, right? Some of the guys in the poker game-- What do you want? Money? -No, just a place to stay. -All this for a place to stay? -Oh, Claudine, he's a smart one. We, my friends and I, have some business to attend to in your fair city. -What kind of business? -Don't get nosy, neighbor. Listen, there's no reason we can't be friends. Even if you are a dirty old man. Why don't you just sit down. We'll chat for a bit. I mean, you have a wife and a job to think about, right? -Artie? Artie, I'm back. Artie, where are you? [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Yeah, is that you, Artie? -It's Mrs. Leyton. My air conditioning is broken. I saw you coming up the street. -Come in please. -I could die from this heat. I could die and no one would find me for days. -Artie isn't here right now. You haven't seen him, have you? -Listen, it wouldn't look good if a tenant passed away because the super couldn't fix an air conditioning. -Well, I'm sure he'll be right back. I mean, somebody else might be having the same trouble. Oh, believe me, these hot nights keep him real busy. -I'd say so. He was escorting a young visitor upstairs no more than three hours ago. -Oh. -I'm not one to notice, but his visitor was quite attractive. -Could I fix you a nice cold drink? -Mm, hmm. Quite attractive young girl. I'd say she was no more than 20 and in one of those short skirts. Not that I pay much attention to these things. -There you are. -Thanks. Don't worry, dear, I'm sure Artie will be back momentarily. -I'll call you as soon as he does. -Hmm, here's Artie now. -Artie, Mrs. Leyton wants you to fix her air conditioning. -If you're not too busy. -I'll get to it in the morning. You're supposed to be at your sister's. What happened? -Nothing. I just got worried when you didn't answer the phone. I've been calling half the tonight. Though something happened to you. So I came back. -I'm sorry I ruined your vacation. -Where were you this late? -Poker game, a friend of Danny's had a poker game. -Oh, Artie, you know we can't afford that. -I about broke even. What's the difference? -What's wrong, Artie? -Nothing, nothing. -Ah, come on now. It isn't the worst thing in the world being a superintendent. -That's all you think I can do, isn't it? -No. -Yes, it is. Like with the diploma. Didn't you ever want to be something else? -Like what for instance? A princess? I know what I am, Artie. I've accepted it. Trouble is you expect too much. I'm going to bed now. Are you coming? -Yeah, yeah, I'll be along. -OK. -Princess. -You had that guy thinking he was Valentino and Don Juan all wrapped in one. -It was too easy. I started feeling sorry for him. -Don't. -Maybe you shouldn't have let him go. -Virge Riff and me and you have been together, what, four years? Two in Nam. One in Georgia. Have I steered you wrong yet? -There's nothing to drink here. Ah, yeah, you've done all right so far. -And this one's so big, it's going to make all those other ones look like nickel ante. -Yeah, well, sort of what I was wondering. -Stop wondering. Look if half the guys had half the guts the four of us got, nobody would be pushing anybody around. Up to here with people who think they've got it made. I'm entitled. -Artie? -Hmm? -The real reason I came back was because I was lonely. Then I got scared. Pretty silly, I guess. -No, you did the right thing. You didn't have to be worried though. -Mrs. Leyton said she saw you with some young girl. -She was visiting somebody upstairs. -Oh, I though-- nothing. -Go ahead. Say it. -Well, Artie, we're so far apart. It's just like neither of us is here. I really want to be a good wife. -You are. Get some sleep. -That's the fun house, New York National Trust and right next door. There's about $800,000 in cash and securities in there. And we're going to make small loan. -You mean like all of it. -OK, OK, dry run, let's go. How many cops on the beat? Virge? -Just one. There's usually two, but they're a little short for the holidays. And his watch changes at 3:30 tomorrow night. -Right, OK, our cops starts his beat. He's walking by the bank. How much time we got while he makes his Patrol -11 minutes. -Right, OK, we're on the apartment building roof. That's 84 feet down to the top of the bank. Street then. Got all the ropes? -I've got them. It's too bad they trained us to be paratroopers. -OK, OK, OK, we come down the ropes. We place one of Riff's surprise packages here. OK, our cop's still strolling. We got seven more minutes. Tick, tick, tick, tick, boom, and we're staring into the safe deposit room. When? -That's 3:59 and 30 seconds. -OK, tick, tick, tick, boom. Riff's second bomb, in the vault. What time is that, Riff, baby? -4:00 AM, on the button. -It better be. I don't want to be kept waiting on that roof. OK, tick, tick, tick, tick, we're down the ropes. We're in. We load up all the goodies. And in three and a half minutes, we're back in the apartment stroking all that loot. And Mr. Policeman is wondering from where we came and went. Let's get started. Come here. Riff. -I'm ready. -This is going to be one hell of a fourth of July. -Artie, breakfast is ready. -I'm not hungry. -Miss Simpson in 6A called. She says she's been hearing strange noises from the Salter apartment. -She's crazy. There's no one up there. -OK, OK, when you find a happy moment, Mrs. Allenardo called and said she'd like you to come upstairs and help her move some furniture. If you change your mind about breakfast will you let me know? -Good morning. -When are you leave? -Patients my friend, it's a virtue, you know. -Very soon. -Going up? -Nice morning for a stroll, hug? -A slow one. [MUSIC PLAYING] -This is the super. [WHIRRING OF SLIDE MACHINE] -Hi. -Good morning. -Good morning, may I help you? -Yes, we would like to put some things in a safe deposit box, a large one. -My pleasure. Please sit down. Your name please. -Claxton, Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Claxton. -We were just married. -Congratulations. -It's been three hours and-- -22 minutes. -As we say in Jewish, mazel tov. -Mazel tov. -Your address. -11 East Lansing Street, Duluth, Minnesota. -How nice, honeymooners in our city. All right, will you sign here please. Thank you, now come with me, please. Make way for the newlyweds. -You're sure safe. -With all this crime, I can see why. -95 years, that's our policy. Now, here's your key. It take two keys to open the box. There you are. -Wedding keepsakes. -Oh, yes, I know how important they can be. You know, years from you look back on them and what treasures they are. Well, let me know when you're done. -Finished. -Fini. There you are. What a blessing. This way. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN COCKING] -You got to sort of babies these things. Make them feel like your mother. I think if I was you, I'd probably just make one good fast move for this. You know. Maybe not though. You probably wouldn't like being dead. Nobody does. Why don't you say something to me, man? -Who invited him? -Nobody. He just walked right in and snooped around and saw a few things here. -You couldn't mind your own business, could you? -This apartment is my business. -You're going to wish that weren't true. -What are you talking about? -He could fall out the window. -Did I ask you? And you're a little too concerned about your friend here. You're one of those people who spends his life complicating things. Maybe you should fall out the window. -Oh, Mrs. Sawyer? -Yes, Miss Simpson? -Has Artie gotten up to the Salter apartment? I'm still hearing those noises. -He may be there right now. I told him you had been calling. Well, if you like, I'll go up and check. -I would appreciate that. I have to go out for a while, but I'm sure it'll be taken care of by the time I get back. -I'm sure. I'll see to that. -I'd hate for his wife to start missing him. Call your wife on the phone and get her up here. -I don't know where she is. -Riff, take Mr. Sawyer downstairs and find his wife and invite her to dinner. Sawyer. Don't get yourself killed. -Go back, Iris, go back. -Artie-- -The stairs-- go down the stairs. -Billy, his wife-- the stairs. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You make a sound, I'll kill you. -Artie, Artie, are you all right? What do they want? -They're going to rob the bank net door. -Oh, no. -Oh, yes, so why don't we all just relax and take it easy. You sure can run, woman. -Why don't you just leave us alone? -Why don't just sit down? -You don't scare me. -My mother used to slap me like that, and I use to slap her back. No sit down. -You're a big man. I'd like to have you alone for about two minutes. -Why not? You've got it. -Ah, Bill-- -Let's go Sawyer. -No, Artie, please don't go in there. I'll keep quiet. -Come on, Sawyer. -Artie? -Two minutes are on, Mr. Sawyer. Come on. Come on. Come on, Sawyer. Come on, Sawyer, come one. Your two minutes are up. Five, four, three, two, have a nice nap, Mr. Sawyer. Your husband's resting comfortably, Mrs. Sawyer. He's all right. He's just out of breath. -What do you want out of us? -All we wanted was a place to stay. But your husband's got some compulsion about protecting his building. Your old man's a loser. -Billy, did you hurt him? -I just gave him a little tap. Why? Why are you so worried? -I'm not. -You know, Mrs. Sawyer, I think your old man's got something for young girls. -Shut up, Billy. -Or Claudine's got something for old men. That chick's getting a little too emotional. I might have to pop her one, you know. What's eating you, sweetheart? Hey, how does it feel to live like a prisoner in this building? What do they give you? A couple bucks a month and a smelly flat to live in? -You know, I pity you. You're really afraid. -I haven't been afraid since I was six years old. But then what would know about kids. I don't see anybody running around calling you momma. -Thanks. -Came to see how you are. You all right? Hey, Artie, I'm sorry? I didn't know it was-- -Is this an act? Or do you just enjoy destroying people's lives? -You stupid hick, you can't blame this all on me. I mean, Artie, you didn't exactly run away from me at that bar, now, did you? Came to see how you are. You're fine. BILLY: There's our cop. Right on schedule. How does it feel to be with somebody who's going to be famous? It's like being a part of history. -Bit deal. -Well, I can understand that coming from you. I mean, all you've got is a super to get kicks from Nothing but of glorified garbage man. -He works hard. And he doesn't have to stick a gun in someone's back to feel like a big man. -Gag them, Virge. You ready, Riff? -What do you think, Champ? -Know something, Riff? When this is over, you and I have got some talking to do. -Like I said, I owe you for saving my life in Nam. But when this is over, we're on our own, pretty boy. -There you go. You comfortable? -Stop the daydreaming, girl. Get with it. He'll be around in two minute. Let's get dressed. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Let's go. Make those calls convincing. -Hey, my apartment's on fire. Sheridan Square. The whole building's on fire. Yeah, will you hurry, please? Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The whole first floor is flooded. Thank you. Will you please hurry? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Yes, it's out of control. The entire wall is on fire. Thank you. Will you hurry? [MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSION] -Now. Now. Where's that bomb, Riff? Where's that bomb? [TICKING] -Riff! [EXPLOSION] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hold it, police officer. [GUN SHOTS] [SIRENS IN DISTANCE] [GUN SHOTS] [GROANING] [SIRENS APPROACHING] -What happened? POLICE: Get some men to the back of the bank. What happened? -What happened? I'll tell you what happened Black boy's bomb didn't go off in time. They killed Virgil. -Stop it. -Think. The citizen twins are our ticket to ride. You got any bombs left, boy? I'm asking you. You owe me, Riff. -I don't owe you nothing. -You owe me. -The only thing I think about know is myself now. -You owe me! -I've still got one. -All right. My friend Riff is going to hide a bomb and we're going to hijack this whole entire building. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TICKING] -Is it ready? Did you put it where I told you? -Yeah, it's set for 6:20. Let's go. -Cut her loose. Come on. Cut her loose. You're going to be our messenger. You're going to go downstairs and tell the cops there's a bomb in the building and that your husband is our hostage. The bomb goes off at 6:20. They send up a walkie talkie. And when we are free and clear, we'll let little Artie go and he can tell them where the bomb is. -What happens if they don't fall for it? -Then boom, scratch one building and a whole bunch of people. They got no choice. Let's go. Don't forget about that walkie talkie. You wouldn't want anything to happen to old Artie would you? The timer doesn't wait for anything. You better run. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Help me, somebody help me -What is it? -My husband, they've got him upstairs. They planted a bomb in this building. -How many people in the building now? -I don't know, maybe 48. But listen, the bomb, they say it's set to go off in 20 minutes. Now it took me time to get down here. They want a walkie talkie. When they're safe, they'll release my husband and tell you where the bomb is. -We don't have time to evacuate the building. -Oh, hurry, will you? -Carter, get me a walkie talkie. Where are they now, ma'am? -7A, apartment 7A. -OK, let's clear this bottom floor. Get me the bomb squad. Take it easy, ma'am, take it easy. -Fun, huh, Artie? -How far do you think you're going to get? -One step at a time, my friend. -You're not much of a hero when you're dead. -You don't think so, huh, Artie? I'll tell you something, this whole city is watching us right now. I buying you a little piece of immortality. And you're going to be the hero. How many buildings you think have been hijacked? Hey, how you doing lover? I told you this was the big time. Hold it. All right, put the walking talkie on the ground. Now your gun. Kick it against the wall. Down the hall. Come on, come on, come on. On your belly. Hands behind your head. If you move, I'll blow you right in half. Let's go red. Come on. Come on. All right, we're coming down. We got the super with us. I don't want any heroes. You hear that. I want the front door cleared. I mean that. Let's go. -No, I'm finished. It's no big time, Billy. I've had enough -Enough? We've just begun. -I can't stand any more. I can't hurt people. -You're on your own, kid. -I always have been. Too bad, you could have been somebody. Let's go. It won't be long. This bomb going to work? -It'll work. -You know, you aren't as smart as you think, Riff boy. I mean, you're not really entitled to any of that money. I mean, if it wasn't for you we wouldn't be stuck right now. -Well, you're unstuck now, thanks to me. -You don't deserve any purpose anymore. You've kind of over stepped your welcome. So long, Riff. -You're going to kill me too. If you let that bomb go off, you'll kill everybody in this building. -You're right for once in your life. -But those people out there-- -Start this thing. -I can't. -What do you mean, you can't? Start this elevator. -It's jammed. -Well, you're the super. You fix it. You got us six minutes and then that bomb goes off. Now you fix it. -Where's the bomb? -I'll kill you. I swear I'll kill you. -Tell me where the bomb is. -You're crazy. Everybody's going to going to get killed. -Now you're included. -I wasn't going to let that bomb go off. Fix it! Fix it. -I can't -Listen-- listen you, that bomb's right there and it's going to go in less than six minutes unless you fix it. Fix it. Now try. Fix it. Fix it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] -Hello? Hello? Hello, this is Artie. The bomb's on the elevator roof. -Pete. -Mr. Sawyer, I'm with the bomb squad. You'll have to tell us how much time is left on that timer. -OK, OK, I'm going in the elevator shaft now. [TICKING] Two minutes. -It'll take us longer than that to get up there. -What? PETE: How is it wired? -They're-- they're three wires from the timer to the dynamite. PETE: OK, you'll have to pull the center lead to diffuse it. -They're-- they're all tangled. -Well trace one with your finger. -One goes to an outside connection. PETE: Then the next one. -I can't tell. They all go down in there somewhere. -Slowly, trace one. -I don't which one it is. I don't know. PETE: Pull one. [TICKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -There ought to be a law against this weather. What are you doing? -Well, there's no reason this place can't be livable. You know, I think, a picture would look real nice on that wall. Or maybe we should wallpaper. What do you think, Artie? -I think you're great. -I could say the same about you. -I wish you wouldn't. -You know, it wouldn't be so bad. I mean, a mechanical engineer is something real special. -I didn't pass the course yet. -You kidding? They're lucky to get you. Maybe they are. [MUSIC PLAYING]
