This means war. Oh, my baby. Fucking college. Okay, so, I checked the weather in Portland and it's 85 degrees, so you will need your sunscreen. Yeah, I know, Mom. It's in my backpack. You got all your other toiletries? Yes, in my bag that you packed. While I watched, remember? You were crying the whole time. Yeah, what a mess. It's not like he's going off to war. It's just Oregon. I know, I know, but it's such an amazing time in your life, you can literally become anyone you wanna be. - Mom? - You could change the world. - Mom? - You could colonize Mars. - I mean... - Mom, you're spiraling. Sorry, sorry, boys. We'll just be one minute. No problem. And remember... - Lakers for life. - Lakers for life, I know. Come back a Blazers fan, I'm not gonna let you - back in the house. - Yeah, I know, Dad. - Stop. - I'm serious. Stop eating the trail mix. It's for Nicky. It's a long trip. Um, I guess this is it. I'm sorry, I'm a little emotional. Mom, Dad. - Okay. - I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Okay, see you later. Call me when you get there. Yo, let's... fuckin' go. Freedom! Let's do this. There goes our baby. Ah! I love you! Every woman dreams of full brows and long luscious eyelashes. And thanks to Profizal's hair-generating technology, I believe we have a real opportunity to market this to chemo patients. It's too sad. I mean, anybody here wanna be sad? No. Nobody wants to be sad. Where's the ad that says Profizal puts hair on men's heads? That's who we should be marketing to. Insecure men with lots of cash. No, actually, Dad, ICO labs said Profizal - doesn't work on scalps. - It doesn't? No. Oh, shit. We gotta get you on another project, dammit. Oh, what about Restylane? The anti-ageing filler? Yes, the new Galderma product for older women. Because, you know, you're a... you're... you're an expert, really. I mean, you're of a certain age bracket. - I'm 40. - Whoa! I did not ask her age. Everybody saw that, right? Would never do that. Look, I really think this would be a perfect fit for you. Okay. Randy, what do you got? Erectile dysfunction, Hank, is a thing of the past with Thoracinil. Hey. So, Thoracinil is banned in the EU, so we can't use Mykonos but he's on a jet-ski. I love those. I love jet-skis. Hello? Uh, well, it's Kristin Dorner Balbano is my maiden name. You never give up the name Balbano. Sorry? Who is this? I am Bianca and I have terrible news. Giuseppe Balbano is dead. Oh, my father's father. God, I didn't even know he was alive. Can you hold on a sec? Paul! My husband's in a band. I'm sorry to hear that. Your grandfather is dead. You need to settle his affairs. His affairs? But, I mean, I don't even know him. You're named specifically in his will. We'll fly you to Italy. You'll leave tomorrow night. Wait. What, did you say Italy? Like, as in Italy Italy? Yes, Italy. Oh, that sounds... No, I... No, I can't just get on a plane and head on over to my dream place. Everything is crazy at work right now and my husband needs me, you know? And I just can't see that I can get away... Quiet, listen to my lyric here. ♪ I'm no longer Ear-ear-earth... ♪ I gotta go. ♪ ...Bound What time is it? Kristin... - Before you start... - Hey - Hey. - Listen, I just want you to know I'm a feminist. Uh... We met before. Really? Yeah. At Domenick's school, I'm the guidance counsellor. Oh, my God. I... It's just that, I wouldn't have done this if you had more faith in your husband. He's a great songwriter. I know. Tracy, it's time for you to go. What? - Listen. - Yes, listening. I support your right to be angry. Thank you so much. - That's really kind. - Yeah, maybe call me, we can talk this through. - Really? You would do that? - What d'you say? Yeah. Sure, I mean... Bye. Bye. Kris, I am so sorry. This is really hard for me to admit but, I have this illness. All I wanna do is have sex. I mean, I wanna have sex, too. We haven't had sex in, like, - three years. - Yeah, I know, but I mean, with a new person. Oh! Yeah, it's not personal, it's... Hey, I left my phone. My phone. - This one? - Yeah, thank you. It's just hard, you know, with Domenick leaving, it's just a big adjustment. Don't defend that douche stain. He's a grown-ass man working at a Starbucks. Stranger grabs your purse. Crotch. Eye. Crotch. Eye. Stranger grabs your boob. Crotch. Eye. Crotch. Eye. - What? Oh, my God! - Is that him? - Is that him? Give me the phone. - No, it's Italy calling again. They want me to fly to Rome tomorrow night to settle his affairs. I mean, that's crazy, right? I can't go. Kristin, what do you masturbate to? Italian cooking shows. I mean, more specifically, Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy. There was this one episode where he went to this burrata factory, and it was all creamy and he got his hands in all the milky stuff. - It was so... - Stop. You've masturbated this fantasy into existence. You have to go. Stranger puts a gun in your face. Jenny, my boss just assigned me a new campaign. Well, make it a business trip. ICO has suppliers all over the globe. How do you think I got to go to Brazil, Iceland and Ireland - last year, huh? - I don't know. To settle their lawsuits. Well, shouldn't I stay here and work on my marriage? You should work on getting your pussy pounded. Oh, my God. Stranger says you're prettier when you smile. Crotch. Eye. Crotch. Eye. Stop thinking about everybody else. Start thinking about you. Fine, then think about your grandfather's last dying wish. Oh, my God maybe I should go. - Did you see what I did there? - No. I just got you to go to Italy by putting - someone else's feelings ahead of your own. - All right, all right, I deserve this. I deserve this. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna have my own Under the Tuscan Sun. Or Eat, Pray, Love. Fuck. What? Eat, Pray, Fuck. Say it. What, Eat, Pray... Fuck? Eat, Pray, Fuck. Jesus. Eat, Pray... - Fuck. - Say it again. Eat, Pray... - Fuck! - Louder. From the vagina! Eat, Pray, Fuck. Eat, Pray, Fuck. Eat, Pray, Fuck. Eat, Pray, Fuck. Hey, Nicky. It's Mom. I just wanna let you know I landed safe, in Italy. I even bought myself a journal at the airport. I've always wanted a journal. Um, anyway... Shit. Sorry, not you. I love you. Anyway... Oh... Whoa! I said you can stand up, - if you like. - Oh, my God. Right. Yes, thank you. Oh, my God, you smell so good. Um, I'm, um... Oh, my God, what is my name? Sorry. Kristin. Hi. - Kristin, I'm Lorenzo. - Yes. Hello, Lorenzo. Lorenzo! Scusa! Sorry. Uh... It's okay. - This is my Aunt Esmeralda. - Oh. She just got back from holiday in Greece. - Oh, nice. - Yeah. And she wants to get home. Hi. Ciao. I'm Kristin. I'm just visiting. Yeah. I mean, I was born here, but I haven't been back since I was a... a baby. What did she say? She wants me to ask for your number. But don't worry, I don't want to assume. Well... So... Ciao. Uh, no, no. Wait. I mean, if Aunt Esmeralda wants my number, who am I to say "no?" Oh, sorry. I am not usually so veloce with asking for phone numbers. - What is veloce? - Oh, yeah. Quick. If... if you knew that, it would have been funnier. No, it's very funny, I get it. I got it, Veloce. Veloce is good. I... I like your veloce-ness. My God! What was that? I am so sorry. It's okay. So, are you here on business or pleasure? Um, well... pleasure. You know, grandfather just died and... Oh, no, I... I didn't know him, that's not... that part's sad, but, um... So maybe... half pleasure. I have to run. Yes, sure. Um... Well, I'll... I'll call you. What... just happened? - Oh, my God. - Kristin Balbano. Yes. Bianca sent us to take you to the funeral. - Oh, hi. I... - I'm Aldo. Okay. Nice to meet you, Aldo. Yes. - I'm Dante. - Hello, Dante. Nice to meet you. - Your driver. - Thank you. Thank you so much. I... It's very... So kind. Hey, you guys. I am gonna change now, okay? So don't turn around or... The Colosseum. Can you at least, please, just, like, go slow? The Vatican. The Vaticano? Did I miss it? I missed it, right? Oh, shit. Ugh, God. Where is my lipstick? Fontana Acqua Paola. I dropped my lipstick. I I Fontanone. Oh, what? Where is it? - Can we go back? - We have to go to the funeral. Oh, thank you. Whew, thank you so much. Oh, my God. There he is. Hi. We have the same eyes. We have the same eyes. That's... Buongiorno. Hi. Ciao. Sorry. Um... Are you Bianca? Sit. This is Fabrizio, your grandfather's great nephew. Oh, hi, hi. Nice to meet you. So, that must make us, like, second cousins, right? I'm sorry for your loss. Is he mad at me? Amen. Uh... what did my grandfather do? He was a winemaker. He made wine? I wanna make wine. Oh, my God, it must be in the genes. I mean, you can't argue genes, right? Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay? Veloce means quick. Quick, quick, quick! He needs help! Hmm. . Say hello to my little friend, Nico. What the fuck is going on? So... Aldo and Dante are my drivers, but who are you, really? - Soldati. - For the Army or... Scusi. Hi, hi. Uh, I'm still in the dark here. No, no, it's a figure of speech. Can someone please just tell me what's going on? Your grandfather, Don Giuseppe Balbano, may he rest in peace, was murdered by the Romanos. We invited them for a meeting, but things went wrong. Our Don and their Don got killed. They disrespected the funeral! They shot at the coffin! Don Carlo. To calm you down. Okay, thank you, thank you. Grazie. The wine's bad. The wine's gone bad. That's... The wine is bad. It's a front. Oh, God. Is that why he got murdered? No, that's crazy. I mean, is it? Your grandfather was not just a winemaker. No? Ciao, Kristin Balbano. I'm your grandfather, Giuseppe Balbano. If you are watching this... I'm dead. I'm sorry I never got to see you grow up, but I am even more sorry that you grew up without a father. My father died in a construction accident. Your father did not die in a construction accident. Your father was killed by a member of the... Romano family. After this incident, your mother took you back to America in search of a safer place. Hey. I told her that the safest place would be with us, but I respected her wishes. You do not cross a mother. - It's you. - Oh. I remember when you were born, picciridda mia. I held you in my arms... and I thought, "One day "she will be a brave, confident woman "who will make me proud." Saying goodbye to you, my only grandchild, was the hardest thing I ever had to do. And so, my dying wish is that you, my direct bloodline, take over and be the new boss of the Balbano family. My trusted general, Bianca... will be by your side to help you. Kristin, I know you will respect my wishes as I respected your mother's. Oh, this isn't... I think, uh, no. I think there's been a bit of a mistake because there is no way that I... Me? Thanks, everyone. This has been very informative, but I have a Colosseum tour at 5 p.m., - so I gotta go get a cab. - No, you can't leave. If the boss says you are the boss, - you are the boss now, comprende? - Yeah, yeah but you know what? I am not a boss, like, not in any way, shape or form, so, you know, especially not in a Mafia kind of way. I should be the boss! Yes, yes. Good idea. He should be the boss. I mean, who am I to steal anyone's boss thunder? Besides, I've got a lot of shit going on at home, my son just went to college and my husband just cheated on me, so... You want we should take care of him? Hmm? Mmm? No! No. No, God, no, no. I just need a vacation, I just really want my Eat, Pray, Fuck! Eat, Pray, Fuck? Yeah, it's a play on words, you know, the book, Eat, Pray, Love? Yeah, it's a very uplifting and moving memoir by... Elizabeth Gilbert. Yes! Yes, see, he knows. Yeah, I wanna make wine, and I wanna eat pasta, and be romanced, and... But you came for a funeral. Yeah. I mean, you know, after the funeral. Hello? Lorenzo. It's Lorenzo, I should take this. How are you? - Give me this. - Hey, what? No. What? No, no, no, no! Oh, my God. I just paid that off! I won't get another upgrade for a year and how is Lorenzo supposed to get in touch with me? How will I ever have sex? You cannot be speaking to random strangers. It's too dangerous. He's not a stranger, he's gorgeous. Okay. You know what? I'm done. Bye. Kristin! Kristin! You can't run away from your destiny. Oh, yeah? Watch me. Which way is it? It's that way! But I must warn you, once you walk out those gates, you will no longer be under our protection. Also, you have no phone. You said you wanted to learn how to make wine, yes? We have machines to crush grapes now, but this is the classic way. This does feel kinda nice, huh? You must stomp on the grapes - to release their juices. - Yes. And you must also take over as the Balbano family boss. This is insane. Where would I even begin? Shh. Come here. Are we actually the Mafia? Your grandfather preferred to call it the "invisible family." Oh, that's spooky. Invisible but strong, and we can't appear weakened. So, you must go to a meeting with our enemies, the Romanos. What, the... the people who shot at us earlier? Oh! I mean, can't Fabrizio go? It seems like he would love this stuff. It can't be Fabrizio. He started the shootout. He's a hot-head - with a horrible temper. - Hmm. Just like Sonny. Who's Sonny? From The Godfather. Oh, right. Yeah. I never saw The Godfather. Oh, my God. Okay, look, it's really hard to find three and a half hours. All you need to do is offer their new Don a part of the east. Something your grandfather was too stubborn to part with. Please, we need someone who's level-headed, empathetic - and unassuming. - Did you just call me pathetic? We need you. No, I will never be ready. No. No. Also, we will give you a new phone... Oh. Oh, oh. So you can go Eat, Pray, Fuck Lorenzo once we finish the background check. Background check? Yeah. Lorenzo Villaguzi, aged 33. Oh, my God, he's quite young. - Men do it all the time. - That's true. He's born in Milano. Which we don't like. Yeah, but it's okay, Dante. - Yeah, Dante. - And he's recently divorced. Jackpot! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God, that's really good news. - This is your new phone. Yee! - It's untraceable. - Okay. You meet with Don Romano tonight and then you can do what you want with Lorenzo. Deal? Oh... Uh... Yes, deal. Deal. Presenting the new Donna Balbano. You look like a librarian from a library, not a porno. Darling, come with me. Again, presenting la bellissima Donna Balbano. Oh, my God, Valentino. Hello. - Yes. - Turn around, turn, turn. Hey. And that's what you wear to meet a mob boss. - You guys are gonna stay with me the whole time, right? - Yes. - Of course. - Okay, don't leave me. Don't worry, Kristin. Okay. I'm Giannina. I'll be your server tonight. - Oh, I love your glasses, Giannina. - Thank you. This is for your bag. Oh, it's so cute. Little monkey. All right. Thank you. You're not Fabrizio. And you are not what I was expecting. I was told I would be meeting with the new Balbano family boss. Yeah, that's me. Kristin. The new boss. Ah. I apologize for my rudeness. Oh, no, not at all. But, you know... it was... it was a bit of a shock to see a beautiful woman. Stop. Oh, I'm sorry. I am Carlo Romano, the new boss. Oh, well, there you go. We're both new bosses, we have so much in common. Look at that. So, what were you thinking? I was hoping to try gnocchi. I love gnocchi and I promised myself if I ever came to Italy, I would eat as much gnocchi as I could. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I meant the territories. - Hmm? Oh, right, yes. Sorry, I... Okay, Google, open notes. Um, so you can take the north and... part of the east extending to... Form-i-a? Formia. Formia. Yes. That's it. Thank you, Giannina. She's sweet. I ordered every gnocchi on the menu. Oh, my God, someone's a good listener. Prego. Oh... Well... Try. You... You want me to try it first? Yeah. Well, no pressure. Okay. That is delicious. This is the best wine I have ever had in my life. Salute. Salute. Listen, listen, listen. It's Oreo. They're two chocolate biscuits held together... with cream? The cream... The cream is my favorite part. Uh, listen... um, about your offer. Are you sure we have to stop at Formia? Hmm? Hmm, well, that's what it says in my notes. Of course. In your notes. Do you like limoncello? Oh, I'm more of a cherry jello person. Oh. No, no, no. Limoncello. It is, um, it is a dessert liquor. Oh. Oh, no, I don't know it. We'll have it in my hotel room. Upstairs. Hmm? All clear, boss. Okay. Well, um, you guys can wait outside while we finish our business. We don't think this is a good idea. Would you say that to a male mob boss? No. Please! It's been three long years. Come on. Thank you. Yes! Ciao. Oh, come on. Oh, my God. Oh, you know what? I don't think I can hold on. I've just gotta pee real quick. I know. I'm sorry. I'll make it real quick. Come on. Ah! All right. Okay. Right. So much better. There she is. Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, so sorry, I must take this. Oh, no, it's fine. It's fine. - Wait. - I will. Let's try this again. Oh, okay. Salute. Oh, Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. If you told me three days ago that I would be in a hotel room in Italy with a handsome mob boss, then I would say you are crazy. But here I am! Yes. Yes, but not for long. Oh, don't remind me. I fly home at the end of the week and there's still so much I wanna see. I wanna go to the Amalfi coast. Pompei. The Vaticano! Too bad you won't see any of those things. Oh, no? Why? Because we'll be too busy making love? Don Romano does not make love to dead women. What? The poison I put in your drink should be travelling to your heart by now. - Oh, my God. - Soon, your lungs will collapse. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No... Hey, Aldo! You are a Balbano. My uncle killed your father. One day you will come for me and the rest of my family. Eventually, we all seek revenge... like Vito Corleone. I never saw The Godfather. No! It was The Godfather Part Two! Okay, okay. Stupid American woman! Your family is in chaos. Soon the Romanos will be the only... southern family here... in... in... in Lazio. Are you okay? Am I okay? I'm okay. Oh, my God. Right. I switched our glasses while you were on the phone. I'm so sorry. It's just that you poured me a way bigger portion and I didn't know if I was gonna like limoncello. And I didn't wanna be rude because, typically I don't like lemon-flavored things. I think it's because I took a lot of lemon-flavored Augmentin when I was a child. It's an antibiotic and it's really disgusting. Oh. Three years. - Ooh. - Ah. Oh, my God! What do I do? What do I do? Jenny. Oh, my God, yeah, of course. Jenny, Jenny, Jenny. Please, Jenny, please. Please answer the phone. Please, please God. Oh, please answer. Okay. Sven. Yeah. [OVER PHONE] Oh. Okay, think about it. - Okay, Jenny. - Yeah. Okay. Hey, hey. Find any hot Italian men yet? Uh, yes. Lorenzo. - You fuck him yet? - Uh, he tried to kill me. And... With his penis? What? No, no, with poison. I... A poisoned penis? Slow down. Lorenzo did what? No, no. Not Lorenzo. Carlo. Wait, who the fuck is Carlo? Oh, my God. He is this super-hot mob boss who I had dinner with. But then he tried to poison me. So, I switched our drinks. And now he's dead. Could I go to jail for this? No. A little poison switch-a-roo? It's classic self-defense. Oh, my God, I killed a Mafia boss. I am a dead woman. Everything okay in there? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ah! You are terrible at playing dead. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God, it's you. - Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you so much. - Kristin, please stop. Oh, my God. Thank you. Is that a cannoli in your pocket? So you fucked him? No, he died first. You missed something. When he came, he screamed like a woman. You... Right. Um, well, I guess that might have been fun? - You took a shower? - Yes. I took a shower because it usually calms me down, but... I've never seen a dead body before. And now I've seen three. Three! I mean, I live a very boring life. I am such a boring person. I'm a boring woman. Seriously, I don't do anything with my life. I don't go out. I just do everything for everybody else. Those monsters will stop at nothing until we're all dead and they're the only family in Lazio. I have an idea. I think I should go home. I don't think I belong here. - Did you not hear me? - What? If you leave now, they will follow you and they will not stop until you're dead. This is good. How? How is this good? This will send a message to the Romanos that our family is strong. You're the boss. And the boss takes care of business. You did good. What? I murdered someone! - Brava. - Brava. No, no, no, no. Do not "brava" me. I am bad. I did a bad thing. Oh, my God, I just want my Eat, Pray, Love. What is he... Ciao, Carletto. Bruno! Mmm. We have to kill those Romanos before they kill us! And I mean on purpose! No more accidentally saving the day! You could be a little nicer to me, you know. I just killed someone. I'm a very good person. I'm a good mother. I would do anything for my son. I do everything for everyone. Even animals, I can't even kill a bug. I put it under a little cup, and I take it outside, and whisper, "Go. Be free. Go live your life." And I imagine them building a new home and a new life. How are we supposed to appear strong when she is... this? These Romanos will never negotiate peace on good terms. Why are we negotiating at all? Why don't we just give them what they want? They want control over all of our territories. So, why don't we just give it to them? How do you expect us to make money? I don't know! What is it we do, anyway? Drugs. Counterfeit bags. Guns. Gambling. Uh, so far I have heard nothing that is either legal or moral. Because... you know, we are the fucking Mafia! You... Let him go. He just needs to blow off some steam. Oh, yeah? So do I. I am completely overwhelmed! This is supposed to be my vacation. - What are you doing? - I'm confirming my date with Lorenzo because that was the deal. But we are in the middle of a war. No. You are in the middle of a war. I am sick of doing everything for everybody else! I'm gonna do something for me. You cannot be in public right now. Oh, I'm not going to be in public. I'm going to have dinner at his place. He is simple and adorable. And... I just wanna be alone with him. These are my cousins. I come from a very conservative family and they wanna protect... my virtue. I guess it will be a family affair. Please. Okay. Thank you. - It's good to see you. - It's so good to see you. Hi. Thank you for having us in your home which is beautiful. Welcome to my aunt's place. Oh, my God, it's totally magical. Yeah. Who is this? He looks like such a naughty little hobbit. - Yeah. It's my uncle, Ernesto. - Oh. - He recently died. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes, we are. That's why I moved in. - Oh, I see. - But I am naming my own pasta line this year. - This is your pasta line? - It is. Oh, my God, that is so exciting. You guys, look at this. This is his. Oh, Lord in Heaven, I have never eaten homemade pasta before. Mmm, so good. You know, it's... it's nice to be with a woman who appreciates my cooking. Yeah. My ex never did. Ah, she sounds like a monster. Oh, no. I didn't mean to bring her up again. Forget it. No, it's okay. I get it. I mean, my husband, my ex-husband was a total man-child. I mean, he made everything about himself. And his band and his cheesy lyrics. That sounds horrible. I'd convinced myself that his passion was more important than mine. Like an idiot. But even with our son, divorcing Paul, I swear to God, it was the best decision I ever made. Oh, you have a child? Yes! Yes, I'll show you. Here he is. There. That's Domenick. He's my baby. He's a really good kid. Last bite. For me? The most precious. Yes. Okay. Oh, your pasta. It's the greatest thing I've ever had in my mouth. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Are your cousins okay with this? Yeah, they're fine. Just kiss me. Shit. No, no, no. Oh, God, I forgot. I've got this work Zoom meeting. Oh, my God. Cousins! I have to go. Rain check? I'm sorry. I just... It's a really important meeting that I... I totally forgot about it. Um... Thank you for having us. I will call you. I can't believe this. Stupid work. I'm enjoying myself for the first time in years, and I have to do this dumb work Zoom. Come on. Quit your job. You are a boss now. Oh. I can't just quit my job. People are counting on me. Hmm. Ma. Ma. Are you okay? My mother had another dizzy spell and she has no more medication now. Okay. Okay? She can't afford it. The SSN doesn't cover these new American drugs. I know a pharmacist. We go tomorrow, okay? No, no, you should go tonight. Go take care of it tonight. Yeah, but we must protect you. - He is right. - No, family first. I'm okay. I'll be fine. Oh, Kristin. Would you mind to put this - into the fridge, please? - Yes, sure. Come on. So late. Okay. Here we go. Oh. I can't wear this. Oh, what am I... Oh, God. Ugh, right. Uh... Come on, hurry, quick, quick! Okay. Hey, nice of you to finally join us. Sorry, the... the time difference is a little crazy, so... So, where are we with Restylane? Right, yes, okay. Um, so first: Restylane makes women feel great about themselves, right? So, I was thinking we open on a woman alone, drinking some fine wine, longingly perusing a travel brochure. Mmm. I'm not really hearing anything that pops. I mean, you know, you gotta grab them in the first few seconds. But I just started. Hey, you know who's really great at this? Just riff, give us some of that Randy magic. Go ahead and mute her. All right. Help me! And I'm just spitballing, all right. But I'm thinking, woman on a jet-ski? Aw, that's fresh. Yeah, but how do we get there? No! S.O.S.! We open up on this attractive but, you know, older woman. Not too old, right? Help me! Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no, please. I'm thinking tight, hot, early forties type role, you know what I'm saying? Oh, my God. You are much more attractive than your grandfather. Oh, my God. No! No, no! So, you know, she minding her business, walking through the desert like people do. That's a great metaphor for a tired woman with a face that's so marked by time. Mmm. Sit down! No, no, no. Please don't. Please don't hurt me. Please. No, no. Oh, God, no. No entrata. Absolutely no entrata. No. You like salsiccia e friarelli? No. No sausages. I'm strictly vegetariano. No, thank you. Very spicy. Spicy? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No! Please, no. Please don't. No. No, no, no. Please don't. No, no, no. Fucking belt. She looks lonely. She looks... - She looks her age, bro. - She does. No woman should look her age. Crotch! Eye! Crotch! Eye! And like a blessing from the heavens, the sky opens up and it starts to rain. Then she looks down and she realizes, "Oh, my God, I'm on a jet-ski." Restylane Lyft gives her a second youth. Yeah. A return to life. I love that pose. Crotch! Crotch! Eye! Crotch! Restylane Kysse plumps her lips. Crotch! Eye! Makes them kissable. Rejuvenated. You got water, you got wetness. Whole lot of wetness. Fuck you! When was the last time you saw a thigh gap like that? Fuck you, Randy! - Now she's kissable. - Oh, fuck you, Wayne! - Wow. - Oh, fuck you, Hank! And you, you fucking creepy pervert! Fuck you! And then she just rides off into the distance. Soft, youthful... and wet. Randy, that was superb. Okay. See that, Kristin? That's how it's done. Unmute. Kristin. Hey, tell me you heard Randy's pitch. Oh, Kristin? Are you drunk? Oh, man. I really hoped this day would never come but I'm gonna have to let you go. By the way, you have some pasta sauce on your face. You know what? Fuck you! Whoa! That's gratitude for you. - Highly unnecessary. - Toxic. Oh, God. Hmm? You left quite a mess at the villa. You need to tell us when things like this happen, so we don't have to worry whether or not you are currently alive. Oh, fine. So, next time someone tries to murder me, I'll be sure to let you know. Grazie. Now, the Romanos want to meet today. Oh, so they can try to kill me again? Huh! I thought once you'd had sex, you would calm down a bit. Hey, I've been here two days and I've been almost murdered twice. That's one per day. I'm gonna need a lot more sex to calm me down! I know a man. Stop with your cousin, please. They're prepared to make some concessions. We have the upper hand. They've agreed to a public meeting. Fabrizio will be there with you. I can't be there because it's only family. Fine. But I wanna meet at La Bottega del Gelato because it has a five-star rating. And I never have gelato. And I have been dying to go! - But we have... - That's an order! Mmm. Mmm! Look, I am tired of this war. Oh, my gosh, Tripadvisor does not lie. My family is tired of this war. It's got to stop. We couldn't agree more. You killed our boss, and our best killer. All by yourself. Does your offer for Formia stand? Yes. Absoluto. So, we are at peace then, Mammone? We are at peace... Donna Balbano. Oh. Well, there you go. Can I get another scoop? You really impressed me. Oh, yeah, the meeting went better than I thought it would. Because you terrified them. Last night was a true work of art. You have rage, Kristin. Wild, passionate, deep rage. I like it. Okay. You know, it wasn't just blood on Bruno. It was mushy, thick. Bits of his scrotum were stuffed in his eye socket. Mmm. And that's why they listened to you. Because he had bits of his scrotum stuffed in his eye socket? Maybe. And that's how you earned rispetto. You'll fit right into this family! Give me your hand. What, uh... Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't have to. - Yeah. - You should... No, no. Oh, it's too big. I don't... Mmm. Yeah, it fits pretty well. And now... give me some "grrrr." Be the leopard! What, uh... No, no. No, no, no. No fur ball. No espresso machine. Just... This one. This one. This one. Bye. Okay. Thank you. Oh, my God. What the fuck? Are you kidding me? Oh, God. Oh, Bianca. You know, a month ago, I was feeding the homeless in Long Beach. I mean, I help old people cross the road all the time. I am a good person. Of course you are. You made peace. Yeah, but at what cost? I feel like Michael Corleone. You saw the movie? No. I read the Wikipedia summary. Kristin, the world isn't black and white. Your grandfather took care of my family. He put my mother through school - and gave us shelter and food. - Huh. And bought me this leg. I owe him everything. My point is, just because you're a Mafia boss, doesn't mean you have to be a bad person. Right. Right. Wait, what did you say about your leg? When I was 13, a truck hit my Vespa. Oh, my God! All the kids made fun of me. Oh. But Don Balbano came to our house with a big box. And he brought me a prosthetic leg. It changed my life. Wow. I mean, jeez, I... I didn't even... Couldn't tell. Looks so real. Precision Swiss technology. - Upgraded every five years. - Huh. So, Kristin, I'm living proof that you can do a lot of good with the power you have. It's not about losing yourself. It's about becoming yourself. But if this isn't what you want, you can leave. I can? You made peace. You can go home to your old life. To the old you. Oh, no, I don't wanna go back to that me. I don't like that one. No, I don't think so. Then what do you wanna do? Well, we're involved in an import/export business, right? Mmm-hmm. Hmm. I think I have an idea. It's a win-win, right? Because we keep prices low and we sell medications to people in Italy that they can't usually find at a reasonable rate. Because it's not just about profit. It's about helping people, right? I was just thinking. We've been together a few months now and I have never been to your place. You're still quite secretive. I am not secretive. I'm not. Come here, I'm gonna take a photo of us and the Vaticano. Right. Ready? Okay. - Yay. - Yay. There. Okay. And now I am posting it. Immediately. There. There we are. Done. - Okay. - Mmm-hmm. Nicky. Oh, my God, I miss you so much. It's my son. Who's the dude? Uh, he is my pasta teacher. We're just out buying double zero flour. Okay. I gotta go to class. Um, I love you. I love you. Pasta teacher? Honestly, I just feel like you're not telling me something. - Oh, really? - Don't you trust me? - Stop it. - Don't you trust me? Don't even joke. You can tell me anything. I love you. Oh, my God. Paul? - Your Paul? - That Paul? Get off me! Who the hell are these guys? What the hell are you doing here? I flew here to find you. I saw your Insta. Dammit. I post one stupid photo. He's much weaker than I imagined. And I imagined someone very weak. - Who's Paul? - I'm her husband! No... - You are married? - No, we are separated. Look, I can see you're a pretty handsome guy and you've been having some great sex... Dante, please take him back to the villa. - Come on, Paul. Let's go. - What, what? Let me go. So he gets to go to your place, but I can't? No, it's not like that. No. You told me you were divorced. Well, we may as well be. He's a horrible husband who cheated on me. - No. No. - No, I mean... It's taken me so long to trust again. - And I really care about you. - No, no. I... I care about you. I care about you so much. Then let's be honest with each other. Is there anything else you are keeping from me? - Hmm? - Um... Oh, my God. Um... I'm so sorry, I really do have to go deal with this. - Okay? I'm sorry. - Sure, go. - It's okay. - I'll see you. God dammit, Paul. Just stay back! I need to pee, please. - What did you guys do? - I shut his mouth. He's very annoying. I need to pee. I can't hold it. Okay. Okay. Nice and easy. Actually, Dante, can you grab some baby oil and Q-tips? - I think it'll be... - Ow! Dammit! I was just getting over a cold sore. The cheater does not deserve your care. You told these people about Tracy? What the hell is wrong with you? Hey. Hey. Dammit! No one talks to her that way. Show some respect. Huh? To Kristin? Ew. Kristin, do something. Why are you so nice to this stronzo? How dare you call me something I don't even know what it means? Who the hell are these people? They are her best grape squashers. And I'm the label maker. Yes. I am a vintner now. - You make swords? - Wine, stronzo. I'm gonna look that word up as soon as I get outta here. Why are you even here? I hadn't heard from you. I was worried about you. I miss you. Okay. Okay, fine. After you lost your job, our joint bank account is empty. So, I figured, you know, since I'm your husband, I should probably come live with you in the villa. Oh, my God. It all makes perfect sense now. You only came here to get something else from me! Go home, Paul. Actually, you only had enough points for a one-way ticket. Pathetic. He's not worth it. What did you see in him? - Just take my card and... - Kristin, no. Don't! - No, you're better than this. - You're right. - I should just book it myself. - No, Kristin. - That's not what we meant! - That's worse. Fine. Fine. Paul, you're a grown-ass man! - Figure it out yourself! - There you go. Own your power. Brava. So, take him to the airport! You've been stress grape gathering all night. Stop worrying about your imbecile husband. He'll find his way home. Or he won't. No, it's just that, you know, Paul hurt me so much over the years with all the lying. And I don't wanna do that to Lorenzo. But you can't tell Lorenzo about this part of your life. I know. I know. But what if it wasn't part of my life? What are you saying? I'm saying... I want out. But the family heads are meeting today. I'm not allowed at the table, but you and Fabrizio have to be there. Okay, perfect. Well, that's where I'll announce my resignation. But you can't just leave. Actually, yes, I can. You said, once I made peace, remember? You believed me. I knew you wouldn't go back to your old sad life. Besides, that was before you created all this beauty. The pharmacy business. Helping people. I know. I just wanna give Lorenzo a chance. So, you're willing to give up all of this for a man you barely know? What? We've been dating for months! Have you farted in front of him? Well, like a tiny little... He didn't hear it. But, you know, he did fart in front of me once. But, really, I've made up my mind. Fine. I just hope this is what you want. Never let a man dictate who you are or what you can do. Thank you all for joining us today. We called this meeting to discuss your pharmaceutical business. Yes. Hello, everyone. I'm Donna Balbano. And I brought a little something special for everybody today. Ta-da! I made muffins. I know you may not wanna eat them because of the whole poison thing, but please remember, we are at peace. See? Mmm. Poison-free muffins. I just thought it would be really nice - to break bread together. - Kristin! - My bananas were going bad... - Enough! And I needed to use them. Your business is causing quite the problem for us. I deal with pharmaceuticals, Mammone. I'm not touching electronics, or your cars. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. But all of our business has to pass by the inspectors. And the inspectors are on your payroll. Hey, listen, listen. I could talk to the inspectors. I have a great rapport with them. The damage is done. We are losing a lot of money. You must pay a percentage of your business. Actually, now is really not the best time. I was hoping we can keep all this beautiful peace that we've been enjoying. You know, I'm alive. You guys are all alive. In fact, these muffins are kind of a parting gift. I'm planning on stepping down shortly. Oh, I'll be leaving you in very good hands. Bianca will be taking over as the new boss of the Balbano family. Your secretary? She is so much more than a secretary. You have no idea. Nice joke. You think you can fuck us all over and leave? No. It doesn't work like that. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Let's all calm down. I'm not fucking anybody over. Lorenzo? Oh, my God, you're a cop? Not fucking us over, eh? Weapons down, motherfuckers! Aunt Esmeralda? Oh, my... Kristin! Kristin! No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Kristin. Kristin! - Let's go! - Okay. Stay low. So, you were just using me this whole entire time? My parents were gunned down by the Mafia right in front of me! At my soccer game. After I missed a goal. Uzi. I was assigned to this case... So I'm just a case? What about your marriage, and your ex, that's lies? Mostly. And who the fuck is Esmeralda? You mean Maria? She's my boss. And who are you? - I am Rodolfo. - Rodolfo? Yes, but you can call me Rudy. Rudy? I'm not calling you anything. Mama! Oh, my God. Are you even a pasta maker? We were gonna run away together. We were gonna open a restaurant. I was gonna make the wine, you were gonna make the food. I was gonna get fat and you weren't gonna care. It was gonna be heaven! How fat? All clear! Get away from me. Please. No, no, Kristin, please. Kristin. No, I am not talking to you. We are done. Uh, no, Kristin. I'm arresting you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for this. Come on. I... You... have a finger in your hair. Stick it up your ass! Ciao. So... This is your first trial, right? - Mmm-hmm. - Oh, good for you. Wait. Wait. Excuse me. Oh, my God, Jenny! Kristin. - Don't say anything. - Thank you so much. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my goodness. Hey! Take your hands off of my client! Give me that. Give... What are you, still in diapers? Bianca called me. You didn't think I was gonna let my best friend rot in an Italian jail, did you? I saw the Amanda Knox doc. No. Oh, my God. How did they get out of jail? Not enough evidence to charge them. Right. And what about Bianca? Where is she? It's better for you if she's not here. Okay, got it. - That Lorenzo? - Yeah. Hi. Dick! Such a good echo. What a dick! Signora Giudice, today I will show that Ms. Balbano has taken over the criminal enterprise of her grandfather, Giuseppe Balbano. Madame Judge, Signora Giudice, I will show you that my client simply came to Italy to pay her respects and found that she had inherited a vineyard. Now, was my client seen in a room filled with questionable people? Sure. But only to tell them that she wanted no part of it. Giannina, could you tell us your dealings with the I ndagato. Well, everyone else calls me "waitress," cameriera, but she calls me by my name. She likes my bonsai tree. She tells us we are her best vintners. She makes us feel appreciated. So, we repay our gratitude by being her bodyguards. We go with her at the meeting because they want to hurt sweet woman. They are very, very, very bad guys. Look what they did to the poor Dante. How long was this undercover operation of yours? Well, I've been investigating Giuseppe Balbano for years. When I met the Indagato, she'd just landed in Italy for the funeral... And when did you start having sexual relations with my client? I ask the questions here! And when did you start having sexual relations with the Indagato? About... one day after. But she was asking for it. Okay. I mean, not... I mean, not asking. But she said this trip was her "Eat, Pray, Fuck." The book is Eat, Pray, Love. You took advantage of an innocent winemaker and sullied a literary masterpiece. You gross. I came to this country at a time in my life where I completely doubted myself. Then when I arrived here, I discovered that I had inherited a vineyard. It was shriveling and dying... much like me. So, I nurtured it. And I came to realize that I inherited so much more than a vineyard. I inherited an opportunity to fulfil my purpose. So... I inherited me. Thank you. I don't need to hear anything anymore. I've made my decision. No grounds to proceed. He's gonna give me a ride home. Bravo! Kristin? Kristin, wait, wait, wait, wait... Congratulations. Well, I just wanted you to know that it wasn't all lies. I really did fall in love with you. And I still love you. I thought I was listening to my heart. But it turns out I was just using another man to validate me. And for the first time in my life... I honestly don't give a shit. Oh, my God. Dante. Dante. Oh, my God, those goddamn Romanos. Oh, he's losing a lot of blood. Here, I've got this thing. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We need to get him some help. Oh, God, who is this? It's Bianca. She's in the winery. Oh, my God, she's been shot, too. Uh, uh, okay, you stay with Dante and I'll go to Bianca. Wait, wait, wait. Just in case. Bianca? What? Nicky. Bianca is dead. Mom. I knew you'd come back if your precious Bianca texted you. Drop the gun. And kick it to me. Good girl. What are you guys doing here? You can thank your husband for this. He lured your son here to... something about guilting you into taking him back. Look, I was worried about you, Mom. Oh, honey. Honey. What do you want? Are you serious? I want to be the head of the Balbano family! I told everyone I'm leaving. And leaving it all to fucking Bianca! Hey! Really, Paul? You're just gonna waddle out of here and leave our son sitting there? Whoa, whoa! No! Don't you dare touch my kid! Mom, look out. I've been shot. It burns. You have terrible taste in men. No shit. Paul, untie our son - and get the hell outta here! - Untie me. Babe, this knot is impossible. Hold on. - Paul. Here, take this. - Yeah? Okay. Keep it pointed at him, okay? Yeah, it's heavy. There. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Yeah. Are you? Oh, God, I'm so happy to see you. - I've missed you so much. - How are you? Hey, hey, I loosened the knot, right? You're a baby. I'm not a baby, you're a baby. You're a big, fat, podgy baby. You're a big, stupid, blonde baby. You're a baby with big poop in your diaper. - Mom! - Don't move! Oh, my God, Bianca, you're alive! Of course I am. No, no, no... Fabrizio is a terrible shot. Wait, wait, wait. I saw you die. You saw me take a bullet like a woman. But there is a fucking major artery right there. Wrong leg, idiot. High tension steel. It's fucking cool, man. I did have to re-adjust it. That's why it took me so long. Sorry. Oh, honey, I'm just glad you're okay. Grazie, amore. I'm hit again. Dad, come on. Bianca, take care of my kid, okay? Make a break for the door. I'll cover. Now! Come on, Nicky. Come on. Come on. Go, go. - Help me, Nicky. - Come on. Drop it. You think you can just come here and take over? This is mine! All of it! I earned it! Uh, you didn't earn anything. I'm the one who had to come over here and clean your mess up. Oh, please. Oh, yeah. I am the one who made this awful wine fucking delicious. Yeah, me. This. I have done more for this family in the last three months than you have your entire life. And yet you feel entitled to be the boss? Oh, my God. Uh... Oops. Are you, uh... I guess it's a little rusty, huh? I should get this fixed. Help me! Please. Please, cousin. Say it. What? Say I'm the boss. Never! Then, as the boss, I'm gonna have to let you go. I've always wanted to say that. You can't do it, can you? Hey. Hey, stop! No! No! Okay. Introducing the newest Balbano rose. It's called Little Pinky. Salute. Salute. Whoo-hoo! That is crisp. You know, this Balbano wine's gonna get me into some serious trouble. Blackout Jenny is coming. All right, all right, sweetie, you should get going. Heard you got shot. Yeah, I got shot, too. - I got, like, five stitches. - Oh. How about you? Twenty-seven stitches. And they left the bullet in my spleen. - You wanna touch it? - No. Put it away. Oh. - I wanna touch it. - Mmm. Now, come. Show me around. You know, I never realized what a badass you are. You know, neither did I. Domenick, there's something I need to tell you. Your father and I are getting a divorce. Are you okay? I know it's a lot to take in. I was just held hostage... at gunpoint. Divorce is fine. Yeah. Come here. I hate saying goodbye to you. I'm gonna miss you. Yeah, but I'll see you next week, Mom. Uh, yeah. - Love you. - Actually, um... I've been thinking about it, and... - I'm gonna stay here. - Seriously? Yeah. Balbano Wine's really taking off. And for the first time in my life, I'm doing exactly what I wanna do. Yeah, but are you sure it's safe here? Aren't there a lot of people who, like, wanna hurt you? No, that's not a problem any more. Hey, Mammone. "Don't fuck with me or you're next." Fabrizio. But you're not like, you know... in the Mafia, right? I make wine. That's all. - A vintner? - Yeah. I wanna stay here - and be a vintner with you. - No. Call me. Mr. and Mrs. Martelli for you. Grazie, Donna Balbano. Oh, shit. Uh, Nicky. Wait, wait, wait. I made you some trail mix for the flight. And don't forget to put on your sweater, okay. It gets chilly on the plane. - I love you. - You, too.
