- Hey folk, how ya'll doin'? It's so good to be, excuse me for a second. Let's move on to some real comedy. Let's talk about me. You know, humor and truth just sorta like mixes up together. 'Course people already told me I had a magnetic personality. Now life is imitating life. Those who aren't from Austin, and hey, all you people from Austin, hey. Thank you for everything, you made me who I am. - I'm really not gonna go into that right now. You don't wanna talk about that? - No, the thing is, when, okay, let me repeat the answer. My first name is, I gave up my first name... Now my first name, once I've decided to drop it is no longer relevant. So it's a thing of the past. And we're gonna, you give away all your secrets then people lose interest. I wanna keep the people interested so we're just gonna let 'em be curious. - You know, when I came in '95, Leslie was quite a fixture around the town. It's almost like you took it almost for granted he was always there. - Should I turn the other cheek? - One of the things that was held up as a symbol of Austin weirdness, over and over again, was Leslie Cochran. Leslie was an icon. - He didn't have an address. He didn't have a home, you know. So he was homeless, by all intents and purposes. - I seen this good-looking girl walking away from me. She had on these stocking-type legging things on and I thought, my god, man. This has got to be a doll. And when I finally got up there, there was this beard and there was this smiling character, and I thought, good lord a mercy. He said, "Hello, I'm Leslie." - A lot of people hear about me long before they come here. I have people all over the world come here looking for me. - Leslie was case in point for why I moved from Houston to Austin. You know? This is what I was hoping for. This is exactly what was looking for. I didn't know it. It made me love Austin all the more. - People argue with me about what I really am. - He certainly did not view himself as transvestite or transgendered or anything like that. He was Leslie. And Austin was his costume. - He was a pretty good litmus test for Austin. If someone said "Who's that guy? "Let's get rid of him," then you're not really an Austinite. If you're like, "That's Leslie." If that's your approach, then you belong in Austin. - Dude, get this. So you have your own magnet collection that we can dress you however we want. - If they make a homeless mother fucker in drag a celebrity, I know I can go to Austin and be somebody important. - The reason why a lot of people are here in Austin, for whatever reason, it's like people who grew up feeling like they were bullied or whatever for being different, or people who were rejected socially. That's why I came to Austin, you know? I think people they identify with Leslie. Not just being different, but for just going out there and just being out there in front of everybody is different. - It's not like we need a lot of Leslies. But we need one for sure. - He's a simple person but there's a lot of complexity in his life, too. To me, keepin' Austin weird is Leslie. - I don't remember when I first saw Leslie. Leslie would come in to hang around the salon. He was always trying to get people to cut and color his hair. But he did pop in one day. Most of the stylists I think were ignoring him because of course he was not a paying customer. That day I said yes. So, what are you in the mood for today? - Well today what I'd like to do is, there is it. Is maybe get rid of the gray. - I'd played around a little bit with film and images and creating. Working with Leslie, I had no choice but to ask him, "Could I start shooting you?" What'd you do last night? Went down Sixth Street. Made about 70 bucks showing my ass. - He was fun to shoot because visually he was visually very interesting. He was entertaining. Always wanting to entertain. He loved performing for the cameras. He really liked the attention that that brought. I was just capturing what he was being. He was a contradiction. He seemed to be neither male or female. And to walk around with such confidence, you don't see something like every day. So how long have you liked to wear skirts? - I started wearing skirts just about when I turned 40. I didn't have any interest in men at all, so I picked up a woman one night. Turned out she was a guy. So that was your first gay experience? Yes. To losing your virginity, ha ha. Do you think maybe you're a shaman? - That is a common thought about me. I've experienced that people will be talking about you and you will show up. - That is being at the right place at the right time. I guess if I was Buckaroo Banzai I would probably just say I fly by the seat of my pants. January 24th, 1996 was the first day that I got here. I was on a three-wheel bicycle pulling a six-foot trailer. I decided to do a book on how we treat our homeless. Just drift around and see how the place treats you. So I decided to do a cross-section trip from Atlanta to Miami to Seattle. And here I am in Austin, Texas. - When Leslie showed up, there was a pretty strong homeless presence in downtown Austin. Especially after the savings and loan crisis. By the time 1985 rolled around, many of the financial institutions failed, many of the development projects fell through. There was a huge commercial vacancy rate downtown. With all those vacancies, the homeless population moved in. So as the city starts growing again in the 1990s, there was a big movement to get rid of an unwanted element in the downtown of Austin. 1996 was when the Camping Ordinance went into effect. - It is an ordinance that in the '90s spread across country in many, many municipalities. These ordinances were clearly and specifically passed in order to control and to regulate out, or to criminalize the homeless community. What is your life like in Austin? - I have a dream life in Austin, and I owe it all to the police department. If the police department wasn't so rotten, and if they hadn't tried to run me out of town by falsely arresting me and perjuring themselves and all that stuff, I wouldn't have stayed here and fought to be free here in the city. So what happened that you decided to protest the police? I mean, why-- - Okay, it's not what happens to you, it's what you do with it. - I met Leslie in 1998. I was working with dialogues for the homeless on Access channel here in Austin. Someone had told me about this guy protesting up on 183, a grocery store. He was trying to meet somebody there at the store, and that he was currently protesting because they were trying to run him off. And they told me if I didn't leave-- - It was hard to believe that somebody would spray a homeless person with a hose. I'd heard about it before, but Leslie made me believe it. I would say that's what first attracted me to his friendship, is that I got to learn a lot about the police activity with the homeless. - When you go after the people that you're supposed to be serving, it changes the whole attitude of the city. - That spring boarded his career, if you would, with the Austin police department. Right after I got here, I got myself a citation for camping. - The No Sit No Lie ordinance really makes it difficult to sleep on a park bench, rest in a park, loiter around a business. Whether you're outside during the day or whether you're outside at night and you're homeless, it's very difficult to be legal. - It was being applied to the homeless people to run 'em outta town. - In Austin, there might be, might be, 1.000 chronically homeless people like Leslie Cochran. People are living in alleyways. People are sleeping in parks. They are trespassing on private property and building camps, and trying to survive. So the phone's ringing off the wall, and the City Council's getting the calls. And then the police chief gets the calls. And then they go out there, rip up the campsite, kick the guys out, throw all the stuff into the dumpster, and the guys move down the block. And then the same thing happens. But they're not going to fix that until we recognize why people are there. It's a profound, catastrophic loss of family. Because that is ultimately our infrastructure, our safety net. - Leslie found himself in jail several times, because he had that willingness to stand up and fight. It developed into a kind of tug of war between the Austin police department and keep Austin weird, i.e. leave Leslie alone. - I've been arrested 81 times and a bunch of tickets. I've been found guilty six times. Three times I got a whole dollar fine. Once I got a $10 fine. Once I got a $15 fine, and once I got a $45 fine. The price of being a serial sleeper is going up. - My very first experience with Leslie, he was arrested for public intoxication behind the kiosk over at Kruger's Jewelry store. I think Leslie had a perfume called alcohol, because it was never a case that Leslie didn't smell like alcohol. - First and only time I ever arrested him it was for public intoxication. So Leslie's case, he was squatting in the middle of the road in what I consider a pretty dangerous intersection at night. Can't really leave him there. Public intoxication is under the influence of alcohol and a danger to yourself and others. Public intoxication is purely subjective. You're dropping on to the training and experience of the officer. For us on Sixth Street, you spend a lot of time enforcing laws that protect people from themselves. For a while, Leslie was in that heyday with a cart with a sign. You all have done this and all that. Totally understand. Fight the power, question authority, all that. We're the authority. - Most of the time, 90% of the time, was Leslie was either sleeping or walking and he could have stumbled into traffic and been hit. That was 90% of the allegations against Leslie. There was something about Leslie they just didn't like, and all Leslie had to do was give them a reason to be arrested, and they would happily take that invitation. This photograph was taken in downtown Austin Community Court. We represented him so much, and he had so many dealings with our students. - I was the lucky person to be chosen to get all of Leslie's cases for the fall of 2002. One case, for example, officers arrested Leslie for public intoxication, and the reason why they even got involved was because he was saying, very loudly in his Leslie voice downtown, "All fucking cops are pigs who want to get fucked." And the reason in the police report for the arrest, he might upset an officer who might hit him, and therefore he was a danger to himself. Which really makes it not a public intoxication charge but involves things that you're saying and what your free speech rights are. This is the kind of trouble that Leslie got into. Yes, he was drunk, yes, he was in a public place. We're all admitting that. But with speech. Representing him, it made it really easy and fun and interesting. Leslie was not cowed by the power structures. Be careful! Have you done that before? Yeah. Where did you grow up? Obviously I never did. Where did you live when you were a child? - I actually, when I was a young man, I was, okay, when I was. Do you know where Tralfamadore is? See, Tralfamadore is a fictional planet in one of Kurt Vonnegut's books. So I won't take you there. Basically, I was born in Miami, Florida. We sort of lived in the Hialeah side, right there on the borderline of Hialeah and Miami. So how many brothers and sisters do you have? Too many. Too many? Do you have two sisters-- - I had three sisters and two brothers. But my favorite sister died, and I really miss her. Just knowing that Harriet's not here anymore is a loss to the planet. - I'm the oldest, and then Harriet came next. And then Albert Leslie, who was an identical twin and John died shortly before the birth. And his name is John because they were born on the Feast of John the Baptist. Then there came along Frieda. And several years later, Patrick joined our family, and then Silas. Mom was a stay-at-home mom. Dad worked. It seemed like a typical life. We had our chores to do. My mother and father, it wasn't a loving couple. It was just two people married, raising children. We went to school at St. Mary's in Miami, which is now the cathedral. Because faith was very important, our religion was important. I was responsible for getting my brothers and sisters to and from school. Albert was a handful. He was always looking for attention. His teacher, Sister Josephine, could not control him. He was a class clown, I guess they would call them back in those days, a class clown. She had to put him outside on the front porch. So he sat outside on the steps all day long. He liked to shock. He was a master at it. My mom was, as a mother she was great. She instilled in me the idea of getting a good education, and she was domineering. My dad was domineering, and so am I. And I'll tell you, I got my spankings. - My mother never got over the loss of John. It's crazy, but some parents blame the other child, and that's what she did. She had an extremely hard life herself. Had a cold nature. I'm sure she loved us, but cold nature. She was brutal to Albert. At one point in his life would say to him, "I wish John had lived and you had died." It was horrible. - He didn't always speak much about his father, but I could tell he didn't like his father. He didn't like what happened in his childhood. He had a lot of sadness when he would talk about it. Whether it was the way he was disciplined, or the way the kids were treated. I mean, I do remember coming down the street and seeing him under the tree in the front yard, wrapped in a sheet that he had peed, so the whole neighborhood could see that he peed his bed. - He said that his mom was cruel to him when he was young. He said that she, I don't know. I don't know if I should say. Think a P.E. coach finally found out about it. One time when he was, he wouldn't, he kept on refusing to take showers. So they finally made him take a shower and they saw he had marks on him. - As I think back on it, I believe that's why I was known as the perfect child, because I would do nothing wrong because I didn't want to suffer what he was suffering. I left right after my 18th birthday. I eloped. My mother did not want me to leave. I was to stay and help raise the children and be there as her right hand. When I left, things started falling apart. Albert left, Harriet wound up having a boyfriend and having a child and getting married. And it just kind of went downhill after that. - It's hard enough for two domineering people to live together. But you get three domineering people, something had to give. So I bailed at 16. Because my parents were teaching me about it important to get an education, I stayed in school. And I worked hard to get my education, maintain my A average. Got an academic scholarship to Florida State University. I went there for a couple years, but I dropped out and joined the Navy. I enlisted in April, May of '73. And there's a real nice military picture of me in a uniform. One of the few pictures of me without my beard. Because during the military, the only time I haven't had this. - After those parts of his life, he started his nomad life, of being able to really figure out who he was, and what he wanted out of life. So what Mom and Dad did to him, he was his own man. He was in charge of his life. He was in control. Now I know where all that showing off, all that negative behavior was coming from. Saying I'm a person, I am somebody. - Albert is the little boy. Albert is the persona he had as a young person. And I don't think he liked Albert. That's why he wanted to change his name. He was ready to live. He loved that being in the spotlight. You know, the motto of Austin is "Keep Austin Weird." Do you notice a weirdness around you when you're in Austin? I do. Well for instance, there's a guy in Austin, who they call the mayor of Austin, who's not actually the mayor of Austin, but they call him the mayor. Of course, why not? - Which is weird. And he walks around town and everybody knows his name except for me. I just call him the mayor. But he walks around town in a thong, and a very short tank top. That may be a little too weird for me, honestly. - Howdy, folks. Welcome to the campaign. - Leslie was very serious about running for mayor and honestly believed that he had a shot at winning it. - This is a very bold move by a homeless person, to actually consider running for the position of mayor of the city of Austin. And it shows a lot of gumption, shows a lot of guts. The "American Statesman" didn't think he was a serious candidate. He was kind of an interesting side story. - Leslie certainly put himself in opposition with other candidates on certain issues. He was an advocate for keeping the Austin sense of place, that was rapidly changing, and a lot of people knew it was rapidly changing. - Hey folks, check out all the traffic over here. See all that traffic? We got a lot of traffic on this road. And you look down here, we got a lot of traffic coming down Lamar too. We're at Sixth and Lamar and we're looking and we're talking about smart growth. What other people are talking about growth? We're being overcrowded right now with an influx of people, and we need to do something about this so we can have a little more livable condition for those who live here. We need to get the light rail and put it in as soon as possible. - In 2000, he was talking about corporate subsidies, about politicians just bending over backwards to bring these large corporations to town. He had seen already, and was already witnessing, how wealthy individuals was pricing out the working class, artist class, the people that made this city great. I'd vote for you! - Appreciate it, thank you. Hey don't forget to vote for me tomorrow. There's eight people on the ballot. Leslie Cochran, number seven on the ballot out of eight. One of the first times he ran it was Kirk Watson and later on, it was Will Wynn. - And even though times are tough and everybody knows it, and folks are hurting right now, the community-- - And both those individuals were very keen on making Austin a business-friendly, tech-friendly, walkable, livable, desirable downtown. - We've gone upon a greedy growth plan and the greedy growth plan is killing a large part of our culture. We must protect-- The one way I differed from the other candidates is I said, hey, let's keep Austin Austin. The candidates that put in on the city charter to keep Austin Austin, was doing everything it can kill what is Austin. They're saying what people wanna hear, but they're doing just the opposite. And that's the trouble with politicians. They have a habit of doing that. - There were a percentage of people who voted for him because he was funny. Austin being the way it is. There's a certain kick or weirdness to Austin. Why not vote for Leslie for mayor? The number of votes he got tended to fall off each time he ran. And was terribly depressed every time he ran and wasn't elected. - If the people of Austin pulled it off and made me the mayor, I got nothing but work, work, work. I mean, I got nothing but work. And you know what? I'll work my ass off for this town. - Leslie could not dwell on bad stuff. He was always more than willing to move on, to let's have fun. How's it going? - Pretty good. - Good. - Good to see you again. Good to see you, what's going on today? - Well, I'm sitting back, relaxing, I'm avoiding work. I've got to clean up all that mess out there and I'm waiting for it to cool off. Where do you get everything? - I get most of it from the garbage, except for the DVDs. You've got lamps, all your clothes are so organized. - Yep, it will be eventually. - Leslie lived in a few different places. A lot of times, it was in his sleeping bag. He lived on people's couches. Another time he lived in a beautiful house in Westlake. This was very typical Leslie. One of his friends had a house for sale, so she let him stay there for probably two months. The master bedroom. I love the mirrors, aren't they great? - I think he probably got along better in Westlake, because Westlake was fancy and Leslie was fancy. He related and they related to him. During the time I knew him, Leslie seemed to cope pretty well. But then with me he had a home base and had a pace to sleep in peace. I really like being housed more than not housed. But not having the money or the means to be housed, doesn't stop me from living a very full and beautiful life. Hey, soon as I can, I'll be out of the street. But in the meantime, while I'm here I might as well make the best of it. He had a friend that was remodeling her house. He did a lot of work for her. That's how he bought one of his sheds. He redid all of her floors. - You ain't taking pictures of my butt, are you? - My sense of why people would welcome Leslie into their homes, or include them in their lives, is that he made that very easy to do. There was Leslie on, and then there was just plain Leslie. That sounds so ordinary, and I almost feel Leslie tapping on my shoulder saying, "I was never ordinary." I didn't hold back any of myself from Leslie. I don't have the sense he held back himself from me. We were just friends that kind of clicked. Leslie taught me a lot about myself. He was a very good friend, and listening and helping me sort things out. Leslie, when you know him really well, you get to see all the sides of him. This gun was hand-crafted to my specifications, and I rarely draw it unless I mean to use it. - Leslie and his movies. He has a great interest in western movies. Which is something you wouldn't think of about him. - I think when he was a child, watching westerns that was a happier part of his childhood. It was always about fighting injustice. - Trapper was just Trapper. A long-haired hippie boy. And, you know, he was called Trapper Al for a reason. He was a guy. I mean, he was definitely a guy. We hung in different groups. But you know, it's a little town. You run into each other all the time. - Trapper was who Leslie was in the '70s in Oak Creek, Colorado. My image of him is more of a hippie/mountain man. - Trapper, I love that, that's so charming. Yeah? Leslie hitchhiked all over the country. And he showed up in Oak Creek and it felt like home to him. - I was working for the town in, let's see, I think it was 1977, for $2.50 an hour. In the '70s when the hippies were here, it was much more laid back. Years later, I got a letter from one of Leslie's friends from Oak Creek, and she told me about this part of his life. His friend Cheryl Lynn said, "Trapper Al "just showed up one day." They never knew where he came from, just that he had been hitchhiking. Trapper Al would play his guitar in Oak Creek and Steamboat and that's how he made some money. I wasn't surprised to learn from her that he always had his flask with him. - I mean, it's nothing like it was in those days. In those days, everybody partied all night and worked all day. Thursday nights became Boogie Night. Band would be on break and you'd walk up on stage and there'd be people boinking behind the drum set, you know? Crazy. - People from Craig, and Steamboat, and Vail would all come and the place would be packed for Boogie Night. It was a good night to just go out and have fun. - He was riding his motorcycle and hit a deer and basically split the deer in half on his motorcycle. And he probably shouldn't have survived. - And he was in a coma. They contacted my mother. My mother went to Colorado and never left his bedside until he recovered. I think that's when Mom realized how much she truly loved her son. She realized that Albert wasn't responsible for John's death, you know? And the thought of losing him was more than she could deal with. She would not let go of him. We all have mysteries, I guess. In 1977 I woke up in a hospital. I had been in a coma for 11 days. I woke up with damaged memories. It's sort of strange waking up and having a big question about who in the fuck you are. And you can't tell anybody, because it's a scary thing, not knowing who you are. - My mother talked about everything a lot to try to get those connections back with him. I think I got it all back. Well, no, I know I don't got it all back because I have bad memories, or had 'em. But a good thing about waking up with no memory, you can remember what you want to remember. You don't have to remember the nightmares. I know they're there, and I sort of got parts of them. I remember the good times. They're the only ones worth remembering. I think the head injury caused a shift in his thought processes. He just wanted to find something better in his life. - It was maybe the impatience from his brain trauma. He was not afraid to live his life the way he wanted to. Your drive to live your life fully and with enjoyment becomes top priority, - Now check this out. You saw this one. Have you seen this one yet? I saw the second one. I haven't seen the-- - You will love this one. It's a little more intriguing because it starts off with a guy, a fish out of the ocean, and he has amnesia. He doesn't know his name, he doesn't know anything about himself. So you will love that. It's a great... - Leslie, he always thought about today and not about tomorrow. So if he had money for some booze and a pack of cigarettes, then he'd worry about tomorrow tomorrow. Today he had the money for he needed. Hasta luego. If I get back to something important. Got it. Sobriety is a rotten excuse not to get drunk. Trust me, I know. So do you think you're an alcoholic? No. They go to meetings, I don't go to meetings. It's not what you do, it's how you do it. - Gorgeous. - Gorgeous. Will you take your right heel and put it in the middle of your left foot? - Fantastic, excellent. - I think in the beginning stages, I don't think that Leslie really thought that this was something that was going to be seriously pursued, or that there would really be a follow-through on it. It all started in this independent book store, but the image of the half-dressed Austin queen has now made it to retailers in over 58 Texas cities and 23 states. - You know, it took almost from the time that it. Magnetic paper dolls originated as a joke into an actual product. Yeah see, you take the basic thing, you pick out the outfits and what they wear for the day. - Right now the supply can't meet the demand. They're just flying off the shelves at every retailer that they're at here in Austin. - Leslie's part of Austin, so that's why we have - He's getting a percentage of the sales, and from what I understand he's doing quite well. What about those magnets at? - Jay Leno showed 'em on national TV. - What have you got here? - Well, while we were down there, Jay, we bought this wonderful souvenir from Leslie, we thought we'd present that to you. - The laughs guy? Well this is, there you go. That is a lovely item to have. It goes on your refrigerator. - Yeah, well thank you very much. - That was the peak for him, the peak in his life. How do you like being Leslie the celebrity now? - It is quite an honor. When you come to places like Austin which has the most dynamic people around, and to have them do something special, girl? It went straight to my head. - He bought a two-story storage shed. It was like 12 by 12 by 12. He bought it with the magnet money, and he called it his house. - I used to make money. I used to make about $35.000 a year. Back about 20 years ago. I was about 35, 36. I was working for Safeway Stores, Incorporated in Seattle. Not in the stores, but in the warehouse. It paid pretty good. Everybody only knew me as Trapper at Safeway. I even bought cars under the name of Trapper. All my life, when I was working, I paid into Social Security. - When he was in Seattle, his life was normal like any one of us. He had a job, he was working at Safeway. Everything was normal. - Never met her. We got an announcement and I sent him a gift. I sent him and her beautiful place mats with napkin rings. How long were you together? I knew her for years before we got married. She lived in Seattle. The marriage lasted about six months. What year was this? - Forget that, gone. I know, but-- - I'm not talking, I'm not talking, okay? I want people to see-- - I don't care what you want people to see. It's my private life, and you know. Okay. - It's not for, you know. Okay. Whatever. - The marriage dissolved. The job dissolved after that. And that's when life really started changing for my brother. So whether the head injury ties in, he didn't want to be contained by the world, and fit into a mold that people expected him to be, he became uninhibited. Being more free to be himself. He became a modern-day gypsy. Albert came to Atlanta, where I was living, and then to Tallahassee. And then Albert went on his merry way and he found Austin, and he fit right in. - What exactly do you do? What's your job description here in Austin? I don't really work at all. I'm just Leslie and I seem to have somehow gotten the attention of the people of Austin. They love me and I go down and I just, a lot of people come up and want my picture. A few of 'em tip, keeps me alive. Just a traveler, and here I am. - There were a couple years that I didn't shoot with Leslie at all. I needed a break. He was doing his Leslie thing and still getting lots of attention. He did ads, movie cameos. His magnets were still selling. His fame was working for him. But in 2009, I remember getting a phone call from Val saying that Leslie was in the hospital. - The doctors, they didn't think he was gonna make it. That's when people thought he had died, that he was gonna be a vegetable. Because the hospital gave a really grim view of what was happening. I woke up in the hospital. I had been in a coma for 11 days. It's sort of strange waking up and having big question about who the fuck you are. - I had asked the doctors whether they thought he was beat up or not, and they said no. They said it was most likely a seizure. But he came back with a vengeance. Yeah, he was determined. Every day he was improving, and his brain was waking up. He's not a vegetable, like the hospital thought. - Leslie Cochran is back, okay? He just wants to send his love and he'd like to give a little thanks here. Well, he's back, ladies and gentlemen. He is back. - I had him here at my home. He was improving by the hour and by the minute, where he was just getting his determination to get back out there. And the fifth day said, "They're waiting for me." And Leslie was gone. You couldn't stop him. I just came to a realization that Leslie is going to live his life to the fullest until he dies. - We're out in front of the Sweet Leaf Tea, the truck. Or it's not even a truck. It's like an oversized limo, where they're giving away free tea. And not only is that cool, Garrett, what are you doing out here besides taking advantage of the free tea? - Well tonight, we're looking for none other than Leslie Cochran. I haven't seen him yet, but we're gonna find him tonight. Positive attitude, they're gonna find Leslie. Leslie, Leslie! Over here! I saw Leslie one day and one of the things, I guess, that shocked me the most was that he wasn't the same. - Hey, how you doing? His age was starting to show. - There we go. - He was actually starting to look a little more like a homeless man. - I got two hundreds, I just need one more hundred. Yeah, one more hundred. How are your magnets going? - Slowly. And it's gonna get slower because this time of year nobody has any money. - I think the magnets could have been marketed much more widely than they were. It could have given him a steady income, I think, for a long time if he wanted it. But I think at the bottom of it, he doesn't trust anybody. - I was willing to help for free, but he was afraid I'd want a percentage. Where are you sleeping right now? - I felt bad for him, because now all of his stuff was in a storage unit. He'd gotten kicked out of his friend's backyard, so he lost his shed. - With Leslie, it gets out of hand in a hurry. The late hours, the junk. Because nothing to Leslie was junk. I moved to north of Annie. His response to that was to march up and down my driveway for weeks on end. Looking back on it, Leslie was already not in control of himself in the way that he had been. At that point, I just moved him out of my life. I moved his cart to a nearby side street, and moved him out of my life. Why do you think people are homeless? Why do you-- What do you think causes them to be homeless? Do you think maybe because they were abused? - I think he's estranged from his family. You know, I thought that maybe his sister, or not his brother, he can't stand his brother. I'm not aware of there being some person or place out there that is sort of a place that he can just go and just hang out. - He was in touch with his sister after the 2009 incident, and would be in touch with her a little bit. So whatever that was with his family, there was definitely some disconnect. - We all stayed in contact, but it was just like we were just a broken family. Dad died in '74. Mom moved to an apartment. Albert would call my mother. He would touch base. And I have to say, as his big sister, when he started the cross dressing big time I was embarrassed. I was like my. I would be terribly upset by it. And he also knew it would get under my mother's skin, and it did. - He had a rough, difficult relationship with his mom. He came over the night she died. He was pretty sad. It was the only time I ever saw him cry. Were you close to your dad? Well. - During different conversations that Leslie and I had, he had had alluded to certain things, and some of that he said he just didn't really want to talk about. But why he decided to share that then, I really don't know. I think Leslie spent his whole life running from the pain he experienced as a child. But those memories were there. - I only had one memory of something. But it came later. My father, he was abusing me, he was abusing my siblings. But he was an alcoholic and he was mentally sick. He came from severe abuse. There's no healing, and there wasn't counseling back then. You didn't take your family to counseling. The abuse stopped with me and my sister Harriet. It continued with Albert and Frieda. They got the worst of it. I mean, they were two babies. Dear god. He was having them having relations when they were preschoolers. It's beyond anything a child should ever suffer. And how my mother never knew, unless she was just blinded to it, I don't know. I don't know. The denial, I don't know. My memory was protected, you know. Because I think honestly if had the full memories like Albert had, I wouldn't be here today. Albert had the knowing and the memories. - Well when the tough get going, no wait, when the tough gets rough, the tough get going. I just kept going. I got out, took care of myself. - Leslie was very resilient. He always comes back, you know? He always comes back. I knew he would again this time. - Okay, I think this is gonna be good. - Very nice, very good - I was worried about Austin thinking Leslie was dead. I didn't want him to have to think that. So when I told Leslie, he said, "I like it when they think I'm dead. "I get to surprise 'em." If you walk with Leslie, you are walking with a movie star. And he thrives on that attention. - In the last year, with the economy the way it is right now, people will all want to have a picture with him, and they don't tip him. So people would buy him a beer and so he just mostly drinks. - You know, he made money by performing. And people would tip him. He said that Austin was changing too much for him, but I think he was changing as well. - Leslie had been in Austin forever, was successful, and I'm wondering if people understood how much he needed financial support. I don't know why or how I ended up with Leslie, and he's never gone away. - Well I will as long as he, you know, goes by the boundaries, which is you don't come in too late at night. You don't come in here drunk. You saw how crowded my house is. There's no way that people falling down can work in there. - She exaggerates that a little bit. - Well, there's been a couple times. - Hell, I'd be sitting here, I'd be sitting in the chair right there awake, and she comes and say, " you can't be sleeping in my front yard" and I'm not sleeping! I'll try to be nice about it. Okay. - And if I'm not, you can edit it out. - Well try real hard, because I don't know where else you're going right now. - Yep. - He wanted to live with me, but I don't wanna live with alcohol. And yeah, sometimes I've asked him to leave because it gets pretty intense. But I always want to be able to have him back. So he's more than welcome at my home. It's hard though. - I always kept my boundaries with him, because I knew how he was with him taking more than was comfortable with some people. Because once you give Leslie something, he wants more. - Finding the right answer, the right place for him to go and to have some support, something that he can deal with, is not an easy task. He's making excuses for everything. That's too far out, or it's too much money. And then he doesn't want to go through the process. So every time, let's go sit down and we'll apply and do the process, he doesn't want to do that. I'm worried, but by the same token, I can only support him the way he is asking for support. - I think it's frustrating for the people who are really close to him. I think most people wouldn't, you know, really want to put up with having an ongoing friendship with him over time, because it's kind of maddening. Guess who that is? I better go see. He owes me 40 bucks. I know, I know. I know, it's kinda hit and miss. All righty. I know. What? Man, you are so persuasive. I don't know if I have a 10. I have eight bucks. So you owe me an odd number. 48 bucks, okay? Okay. All right. If you bring me 50, I'll give you two back. I'll have two ones by then. Okay. Thanks. - All right. Well, that is kind of what he does all the time. "I just wanted to say hello, nothing special." At the end it's like, "You don't have 20 bucks?" But, he always pays me back. So I think it says something about his character. - I had to be real creative to help Leslie. 'Cause I didn't want to make him feel bad. He needed help, and I could help him without thinking he was asking for help. Well we threw a birthday party, fundraiser for him. That brought a lot of people. The people who really cared. - What's it like to have buddies like this - to actually-- - Man. - It's as an important event as any. You know, Leslie turning 60 is most certainly an event. - Precarious job living in a road like that. You know, he's been doing it for decades. - I actually hope that he has a place to live right now, because it's tough living in the streets, I'm sure. - I helped Leslie apply for SSI for his Social Security check. - I'm calling to check on the status of my SSI check and when it's gonna be here. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! - And then he had regular money that he could count on. He just needed money to live on. - Leslie represents what it was like when I came here. I don't know if he or I still represent what it is now, but we're still here. And that says amazing things about, we have a culture here. We may have to be going underground, but we're still a culture. He was a star at that birthday party. - I want to thank you all because man, you made me feel like I'm somebody. - Happy birthday, Leslie, how 'bout that? Cheers! - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - I forgot to check the mail today. Yeah, something impressive. Couple checks here. $2.022, ta da! - Just like you said. I think Leslie was ready for a home and have his independence back. Home means a place where you can feel safe. Where you can take off the face you might have to be wearing out in public. It's where you lay down. So you're feeling okay? - He's very stubborn. You can't really tell him what to do. Is that enabling at this point? You know, I don't know. I mean, I think he's made his choice. I think he made his choice a long time ago. They say if he just keeps on this path it's just a matter of time. - The seizures are starting to be more frequent. And so it takes him longer to recover from them. His drinking doesn't help. - I'm done, I'm over, I'm done with it. He took his money and went to the liquor store. Right now we're watching him kill himself, and that's too hard for me to do, and I'm not gonna do it anymore. He's not allowed at my house. And then when he's gonna be out of money, he's gonna be calling you, you, me, and Valerie and going, "I don't have any money, "I have nowhere..." He's gonna pull the same old routine, and the only way we're gonna end it is to cut him off. I, number one, am not gonna enable him any more. You have a serious condition, which is why they want you here in the first place. - Are you sure you don't want to spend one more night here? Are you sure you don't want to spend one more night here? You weren't even conscious though, until early this morning. I mean, today's your first day you've had a fully coherent day, that you knew where you were and the date and all that, so. Colorado was a happy memory for Leslie. So much so, that he actually had gone back in 2006. He just took off and hitchhiked his way around until he got back to Oak Creek. But he went back as Leslie, not as Trapper Al. - He came in and sat down at the bar and asked me if I remembered him, and I didn't, until he told me who he was. He was dressed very eccentric. So you showed up in this town dressed in a Star Trek uniform? Yes, it was nice hitchhiking around in my Star Trek outfit. - Boy was he different. He had on like Lieutenant Uhura or something. It was a Star Wars outfit with the big boobs and the long nails, and then full beard. You know? You know here, I think, was a memory lane sort of trip for him, but see, a lot of those people aren't around anymore. - It was Labor Day weekend. The town folks all come out. Everybody does the parade and hangs out in the park, and we have music and bands and parties and stuff. So he came strutting by with fuck me pumps, and a leopard skin short skirt thing, and I believe it was a pink boa. I did learn, just asking around, "Who's the crazy guy in the pink halter top "I just met?" It's like, my grace, who is this? It was kind of a shocking because this is a little, kinda probably a little redneck town, if you wanna call it that. There was some that didn't really care for him. "Where are you from? "You need to go back to where you're from." Or whatever, you know. So as long as he was in here, he was safe. What was your favorite thing that happened while you were gone? Did you have any awakenings? - Yes and no. - Tuesday I go to Denver, and here he was just sitting up by the gas station. He was hitchhiking. I kind of looked over the gas station to see who was there. There was some guys that probably, you know, he probably wouldn't be safe around, you know? So I made a U, and I came back, picked him up. And I just felt that if I don't get him out of town, he might get beat up or something, so. Dropped him off and that was it. - You were hallucinating late last night. - Yes, sir, yes, sir, yeah. So, I mean, that's not a normal state to be in, which is why they wanted to keep you here for observation and make sure that's something that's gone for good and not gonna return. - Okay, well. - I think he could tell what was coming, and kind of starting to get on survival mode. He was telling everybody he's going to Colorado, because we weren't recognizing him as famous anymore in Austin. - Now that he's coming to the realization that he's got serious health problems, I'm not so sure he enjoys being in the public eye all the time like he used to. He's just out there for the whole world to see. - It was on Valentine's Day and I was here at the salon. And there was Leslie. - And he said he was leaving. You're really leaving right now? - Yeah. Wait, you're leaving right now? - Yeah. - Even now, I'm surprised at how hard it was to say goodbye. - Well known Austinite Leslie Cochran is now in the hospital in critical condition, A spokesperson at St. David South Austin Medical Center confirmed he is being treated there now. He's been talking lately of moving to Colorado, but he was found unconscious in a South Austin parking lot. Two weeks ago, and has been at St. David South Austin Medical Center where he... What do you think is gonna happen now? The truth? Yeah. - Well, I think that if Leslie has a strong will, he may hang on for a few weeks. But I think that's probably about as long as he can hold on. - Hi everyone, KXAN News has confirmed Leslie Cochran has died. You may simply know him as Leslie, the cross dressing homeless man. He died early this morning at 1:00. The mayor will proclaim today as Leslie Day. He was 60 years old. - Now therefore, I, Lee Leffingwell, mayor of the city of Austin, Texas, do hereby proclaim March 8th, 2012, as Leslie Cochran Day in Austin. - I thank you for your graciousness to my brother, and for loving him as you have. Thank you. I had no idea to the magnitude of how much he was loved here. Had no idea. The city came out. There was a parade, and there was a memorial service the day after. I keep saying it is that of a dignitary, not a homeless person. They're forgotten, he wasn't. And it really made a difference in my heart. And I asked forgiveness for ever being ashamed of him. - Leslie was a perfect Leslie. He made a statement, he affected the city in a beautiful and special way that no one else has, and I doubt anyone else ever will. - Leslie was a real gift to me. You were confronted with what does it mean to feel compassion. The person who's drunk and obnoxious and a little out of control who's sitting in front of you. And he gives you the chance to learn through the deeper meaning of how to join his suffering. That's a gift, it's a real gift. - Do we need a Leslie? I think we need original, creative people. People with heart, people who care about other people. And he was all of that. - Leslie was not planned. Leslie did not sit down at the drawing board one day and draft out what this was gonna look like. That is true authenticity. Yes, I miss him terribly. And it's getting to that point in the conversation. - He was such a good friend. I miss him immensely. - Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeoning of chance, my head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms the horror of the shade. And yet the menace of the years finds, and shall find, me unafraid. It matters not how straight the gate, or how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.
