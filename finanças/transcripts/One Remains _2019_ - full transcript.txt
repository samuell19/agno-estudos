Ah, Mr. Mahoney, thank you for speaking with us today. - Ah, it's my pleasure. - I understand recounting what you saw is difficult and it's appreciated. - Well, I think it's important. What happened to those kids out there I think it needs to be told so it just never happens again. - I understand you spent some time with them before the incident. - Yes, a little. - Was there any indication that you can think of of their behavior that would lead to? - No, no they seemed like just normal kids. - After reviewing the autopsy reports and the pictures, what happened out there was extreme. - Yes. Self inflicted? Inconclusive. - It's difficult to accept that a group of people would do something to themselves. - You know I'm, I'm gonna stop you right there. You know people just don't understand that the woods are a very beautiful place but they're very dark, dangerous and mysterious. And something like this could happen to anyone. You, me and just find yourself at the wrong place at the wrong time. And it's amazing what your mind can justify. - Oh, oh hi, oh whoa, who's that? Who's that handsome devil? Well that's Russell Delphino, or some people call him, the Delphino Albino. And this is another episode of, how did this fucked-up shit happen and why do we care? - All right would you stop wasting gigabytes, I'm tired of looking at your fucked-up face while I edit. Oh ladies and gentlemen on my left in the driver's seat is a woman, which is only slightly worse of an idea as maybe an asian driver. - Okay, fuck you! Geez eas, whoa easy! Jesus, what are you, a moth attracted to headlights? Jesus Christ! Oh, uh oh, oh hey princess. Hey, oh waking from your nap? Oh, do you need to stop and piss for the 86th time? - I can't help it, I've got a small bladder! We know. - Thanks guys. - Hey who is that handsome devil? I think that's the second most handsome devil in the car. - You mean, this old thing, stop it! - Hey, second handsome, can I get some chips? - Of course. Do you want a Molly special cool ranch or would you like a spicy nacho, a jalapeno cheddar or you want OG Dorito? - A Molly special. - God damn, what else do you have in that man purse Mike? - Don't be jealous, I have a little something for everyone. - Hey whoa, easy you piece of shit. Ooh. Ooh, ooh. - What are you doing? - Nah, nothing, just trying to exercise some demons. The power of Christ compels me to touch your nipples! I need an old one and a young one and a slightly droopier one than the other. All right we're here! Thank god. You made it! You must be Molly? - I am, you must be Lance. - Pleasure to meet ya. How was the drive? Oh stunning! It is so beautiful out here. - Ah, thank you, my family's been here for generations. - Well your property is absolutely gorgeous. - Oh, well, years ago the military crossed into our property and law suits, yada yada. Oh, you guys don't waste any time I see. - Yeah, it's a documentary, we document. - That's right, we do document. We try to get everything we can. We usually end up cutting like, 90% of it, but it's just good to have more than we need. - No, no need to explain, I get it. - You get many visitors out here? - Ah, we don't actually. Years ago, journalists hounded my dad day and night but that was a long time ago. In fact it's why I was kinda surprised when you guys called. This is certainly the largest film crew we've ever had here. - Well we appreciate you letting us stay here and film, I know it's a lot to ask. - Ah, don't worry about it, you can thank my dad, he's the one who insisted. - Hey um, where's the bathroom? - Are you fucking serious? - I have to pee! - It's all right, let me show you inside. - Thank you. - Fucking actors! Say your line, line sayer, Jesus! - Hey intern, why don't we play a fun little game called carry the bags. All right. - Hey! - You can have it back after you've done what you've been told. Hey, you're the one who wanted to be part of this. - Oh, I got so fucking badly wanted to be part of this crew. Here we are, after you. Bathroom is to the left and the rest of us can head up top. Jesus. - Well, here we are. Three bedrooms, including the master. Little bit of a tight fit for six people, but I think you'll be able to figure it out. We have hot water of course, fire place. Looks like I'm a little low on firewood right now. - That's okay, I can split some later if there's a pile. - Sure there's a shed out back, thank you. - Ah, do you think after we get settled in we can meet Mr. Mahoney, get a few prelim questions out of the way? - I, uh, I'm not sure that's a good idea. Oh, uh. - It's just that it's been a rough day. You know, the Alzheimer's takes him in and out. You're welcome to stop by and meet him if you like but honestly I don't think you're gonna get any of your questions answered tonight. - I understand, my grandmother had Alzheimer's, so, I get it. Ah, this is is Wendy, she's our host. Maybe she and I can pop by later and say hello. Just the two of us, no cameras. - Sure, I don't, I don't think that'll be a problem. But I don't think I would wear that shirt if I were you. Sorry it's just, the old man's a little, little set in his ways. He doesn't take kindly to new-wave thinkers. New, I'm sorry? - No, I don't mean to offend, it's just, we're not used to the gays up here you know. - No worries, I understand, completely. - Hey, do you guys have any like, quinoa, gluten-free, dairy-free kinda foods? - I, I don't understand what you're saying. - Ignore her. Apparently it works exclusively with assholes. - I'm sorry. Well listen, the refrigerator's stocked and the stove and the oven works if that helps you any. And if you need anything else at all, feel free to come on over. Oh, and by the way, there's no cell service here. So if you need to make a call, there's a landline in the main house, in case there's an emergency or anything and if you need to go into town, you'll have to drive around the mountain road, same way you came in. A little windy, little long of course, or you could just hike through the mountains, it's about four miles from here. - Thanks Lance, we appreciate it. See you soon. - Fucking sluts! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Should we be filming this? - He's had a rough night, I don't wanna overwhelm him. - Since when did you give a fuck about exploiting your subjects? - Listen, I'm just trying to be sensitive all right? Relax and keep playing with each other's balls. - That's fine, I brought two. - Not gonna get anything from him! - Excuse me? - My grandpa. Not gonna get anything, you just couldn't find online. You know maybe that's where you lazy fucks should have started! - Hey what the fuck, you little shit! - Russell stop! - You know, why don't you guys just go home? - What a prick. - Shit head. - Guys it's all right. Just let it go, he's just being protective. - I'm sorry about Noah, he gets a little antsy when strangers come around. - Well, hopefully he'll warm up to us. - So, I was thinking we could do the interview in here. It's got plenty of space and this works for you. - Yeah, this is great. I mean, it's a little dark but we've got some lights we can set up, so no problem. - Hey, um, who's this? - That's my mother, Cathy. She passed away when I was young. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Gosh, she's really beautiful. - Yeah, thank you, was a long time ago. So, let's ah, go see the old man, shall we? Oh hey, word of warning. I don't know how coherent he's gonna be and if he acts out at all, don't take it personally. You know, he has his moments. But tonight, so far, he's pretty somber. Hey pops? Got a couple of visitors. - Mr. Mahoney? - Hi, my name is Wendy, how are you? - I'm Molly. We're here to interview you about the pass incident. Do you remember talking to me on the phone? Mr. Mahoney? Sorry to bother you sir. - Maybe he'll feel better tomorrow. Let's go. - Cathy. - Dad no, that, that, that's not mom. - Cathy. - He thinks all women are Cathy. - Why did you leave me? Why did you have to go? Cathy. Why? How was it? Is he has crazy as people say? - He's fine. - Should have filmed it. - 'Cause I heard after he found the bodies, he went round the bend. - Okay no, first of all, we want him to trust us. Okay, we're not trying to damage his psyche any more. And no he didn't go round the bend, but he is sad, he lost his wife for Christ's sake. - Who gives a shit? He's a crazy old man who's gonna forget you in 10 minutes anyways. He's got fuckin' old timers or whatever the hell it's called. - God dammit Russ, shut the fuck up! He's old and he's sick! And people died here, right here! What this guy saw really fucked him up! So be a man and start taking this shit more seriously. You're not funny, you're not cute. You're a fuckin' asshole! And these people deserve better than that. - Well Jesus, who shit in her Cheerios? - Apparently, you did. - Fucking asshole. - What about you Mother Theresa? Short stack? Fuck this shit! - Molly? You can't take him personally. - He's such a fucking douche bag! - I know, I know, you just, you have to ignore him. - No fuck that, I'm tired of always having to be the one to accept that that's just who he is! - You're right, you're right. What? No, no, no, no, no. Corrupted file, fuck! - Hey, calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down, this is our footage! - I know, and we've got it backed up. Oh god. Oh fuck. Oh god, not again, please. - Okay come here, come here, come here. Shh, calm down. Relax, I got ya. - Sometimes I just feel so overwhelmed, like I can't breath. - Yep, I know. Hey, let me get you some water. Okay thank you. - Course, gotta take care of my people, right? - Hey, you're missing out on all the fun. - I'm not really in the mood. - Oh come on, don't do this. - Just wanna get some work done Becca. - You'll have plenty of time later. - Are you drinking? - Maybe. Why don't you come and found out? I'm so bored. What ya up to? - I'm editing. - Editing what? - Our footage. - Oh, can I see? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to delete that one, that's a bad angle. I look fat, delete that! - Okay can I help you? - Hey Mol. - Hmm. - Do you find me attractive? - You know you are, stop fishing for compliments. - I got rejected twice. Do you know the last time I got laid was? Okay, Okay. You don't have to give me the stare, I'll leave. - You know, I could fuck you if you want. - What? You're not serious. Why not? I'll fuck you. - Okay. You know I'm not as shallow as everyone thinks I am. - I know. Seriously. - We just had sex because you felt rejected. You are shallow. But it's okay though, I like you. - You don't, you don't think I'm that shallow, do you? - Yeah, yeah I do. But you're an actor, it's kinda part of your job, supposed to be vain, it's cool. I'm shallow too. - And that's pretty much why I don't do the butt stuff anymore. I mean, I bel, I'm a tit guy mostly and... Oh hey, what were you two doing in there? - None of your god damn business! - Could you please not take the lord's name in vain. - Oh sure, none of your god damn business! - Go talk to her. So that was interesting. - Yeah. - I could tell Molly was definitely up to no good and then the artist formally known as the disco blueberry went bouncing down the stairs. - Are you still mad at me? - I don't know, maybe. - All right, fine, I'm sorry. Uh and you, you know how much that hurts my face to say that. I don't know how you people do it. Like... You're right, maybe I was being a little bit of an asshole. But I know this is important to you and that makes it important to me. - Thanks Russ. - Like 40%, 40% important and that is a lot. Like, my mom's like 31. And, like, ice cream's like 17, 'cause I'm lactose intolerant and like kittens, are like six. They're zero, I fuckin' hate cats. I mean like, I wanna support you. I'm like your Victoria's Secret. You know, yeah, okay, like an underwire bra. You know, how it holds up the big set of ugly floppers. Like, I mean, not like yours, not that you have ugly floppers. You got like a respectable C, but like what I'm saying is like a water bra's fake and guys know but like, a supportive underwire bra, is, it's... - Stop talking. - Right. - Ugly floppers? - And that is the second time I got it stuck in the vacuum cleaner. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, save some for the fishes. - Hannah, you should go to bed, it's late. - Becca, it's not even midnight, I'm not five. - Yeah Becca, she's not five! Here you go kid. - Hey you can't have that! - Well lighten up, it's just a sip. - Yeah, she's not gonna be snortin' coke off a hooker's thigh for like, what, your birthday's in like four months right? - That's not funny. - It's not, you laughed. - Is there like, anything else we can do around here besides drink and stuff, you know? - What do you wanna do? - Hmm well. We could tell scary stories. Ooh! - I think Michael knows a scary story. Like what? - I think we both know a scary story. I think, uh maybe like, Wendy's face without makeup. - Hey guys, what'd I miss? - Huh, this dick! - Oh good, I thought I was missing something big. Ooh! - Ah hah, you do have a micro-penis. - It is a recognized medical condition. - Oh, actually I wanna know what happened here. - You haven't told her Becca? - I gave her the Cliff Notes version, she's too young. - Okay, yeah but she's part of the crew and if you want her to be involved, she should know the details. - Did you hear that? I'm part of the crew, is that what you said? Wow, I'm part of the crew. - You really wanna know what happened here kid? - Yeah I wanna know what happened to the old man. - Well, the real problem there is, Russell's mom never hugged him enough. - It's true and my dad and my uncle hugged me too much. - No, I didn't mean this old man, I meant the other old man. - Back in the 70s, bunch of college students came up to hike the pass and they were experienced and they were prepared and then something happened, and they all disappeared. It took 'em over a month to find the bodies. - Well what happened to them? - Nobody really knows. Old man came up to the campsite, found all the tents empty, food still in the skillets, so he figures they go on a hike. But then he sees a single shoe so he keeps walkin'. And then he finds the first body. - A little bit further, two more bodies. One of 'em, tongue ripped out of his mouth. The other one, eyes gouged out of the skull. - And they had hardly any external injuries and they couldn't tell whether they did it to themselves or each other. And they all had internal bleeding but nobody knows from what. - Ew. - Well that's disgusting. So what does that even have to do with the old man. - Well he was the park ranger back then and they stayed with him for a day before heading up the trail. He was the last one to see them alive. - And the first one to see 'em dead. - Yeah, and then really fucked him up too. - Can you blame him? - Do you think we'll get the interview we want? God I hope so. 'Cause if not we're here for no fuckin' reason. We should probably go to bed. We gotta be ready to roll at any time tomorrow. - Yep, all right kid finish this for me will ya? - Hey Mol. - Yeah. - I just wanna let you know that I except you. - What? - I except you, who you are. You know, the whole gay thing. - Right, yeah, the gay thing. - I don't judge, only he can. I love you no matter what! - Oh, okay. Well thanks for your approval. It really gets me through my day. - Okay no problem, good night! Good night. - Hey Becca, what's the wifi password? What? - There's no wifi here. - Why not? - You're gonna have to deal with the beautiful outdoors for once in your life. - Hmm, that's gross. - Hey, you're surrounded by God's creation, you need to learn to appreciate it. - I'm not hungry. - Hanna, y- - I'm gonna go outside and experience God's wonderful creation for once and maybe his cell service too. - Good luck, hey, don't go too far. You need to keep yourself available in case people need you. - Oh, 'cause I'm officially everyone's bitch. Hanna. - So who's the bitch now? Oh toast! Ow! Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey there you pretty boy, Paul Bunyan bitch. Want me to show you how a real man chops wood? - Yeah, you wanna go get Molly? - Oh, fuck you. Ah, hey ah, Sister Mary Rebecca in there made some Jesus toast if you want a piece. - I stole some. - Well sausage too. - Maybe later. - All right, well I'm gonna go piss on some shit. - Uh. Ah. Morning. Wonder what time it is. Hmm. You know, we could stay in bed and cuddle and talk. Molly? Molly? What's the wifi password? What? Whatever. - Hey! You gotta watch yourself out here. - I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't realize what I was doing. - It's easy to get carried away out here okay? - Yeah. - You need to be more careful from now on. These woods will play tricks on you. - Thank you, for saving me. - Do you have any kings? - Yeah. Ah, do you have a jack? - I do actually where'd you put it? Okay, I'm blind so. - Okay. Hey Molly? - Hey Lance how's it goin'? - The old man is lucid at the moment if you wanna give it a shot. No guarantee how long it will last. - Oh great, thank you so much, we'll head right over, okay? Thank you. Boys! We're ready to roll. - Molly, Molly, hey, hey! We were, we were just, we... Did you know? - Russell I don't care who you fuck and if you try to justify it to me, I'm gonna punch you in the face. - Good talk, good talk. - Mr. Mahoney I just wanna let you know you can stop the interview at any time. Take all the breaks you need. - That's very kind of you. I don't think that'll be necessary. I'm a lot tougher than I look. Okay. I'm gonna let Wendy take it from here. - Hi Mr. Mahoney, how you doin' today? - Darlin' I'm doin' decades later with you in front of me. You know if I was any younger, I'd let you turn me down a few times. I like him. I'm sure you do. - Ah, where were y'all when I was 20, huh? Ah, nevermind don't even answer that, let's get on with it before you break my heart some more. - All right, picture's up, let's roll camera. - Camera speeds. - Samuel Mahoney interview, take one. - All right everybody settle in and action. - I just have one more question for you Mr. Mahoney. And what's that? - What happened in the past is one of the most mysterious tragedies in history. What was it like walking into that awful aftermath? Did that affect you in any way? If so, how? - Short answer to that. Unfortunately, yes. What I witnessed up on that pass, I was not prepared for. The impact of it changed my life. My wife Cathy, she was the light of my life. She deserved better than me. I wouldn't be sitting here today if it wasn't for her. Her strength. But when Lance was coming along, she, she gave me an ultimatum. She couldn't take it anymore and she said to me, she said, "Samuel Mahoney, you are acting like you "are the one that died on that pass. "And if you continue to let life go by "I'm gonna go with it. " And she wasn't bluffing. She left. Well we didn't speak for a long time, 'til Lance was born. And when I held that baby in my arms, I remembered how precious life is. And I begged her, I begged her with all my heart to come back. And I loved that woman. I loved that woman. But it wasn't enough. - And cut. - So, I'm up in this watchtower and I am stoned out of my gourd and this bear is hauling ass up the ladder like a sailor with his hand up a skirt. And I'm up there and I'm not about to wait to find out if that bear is smart enough to open that latch. - So then what'd you do? - I have jumped my ass out the window, thank god there was a tree outside. - Weren't you scared? - Hell ye, darlin' let me tell you somethin' there is a reason they give rangers brown pants. - You are the coolest old man I've ever met. - Hmm, tell him that. - For fuck's sake. - Noah! - What? - You guys don't believe this shit do you, it's... It's a joke. - Kid If I ever talked to my old man like that when I was your age I got my ass beat. - Yeah? Well look how great you turned out. - Noah! Manners. - No, it's all right, just kinda reminds me of me when I was his age. - Well that's a fuckin' insult. Noah! Leave, now! - If you'll excuse me, I have chores to do. I'm sorry. In this household, we believe in discipline, not disrespect. My apologies. - My old man always said that needed a firm hand when things got out of order. Nah, Noah's a good kid. Poor Lance, when his wife died they moved in with me and, just kinda been a tough transition, you know? He's all right. - Well I just wanna thank you both so much for today. The footage we got has truly surpassed our expectations. - That's fantastic. If you need anything else just let us know. - Well we're going to compile the footage with the interviews from the victims' families. I've been trying to find footage of the actual incident but it's been really hard to come by. - Footage huh? You want some footage. - Dad. - I have some. - What? - Yeah, I had my camera with me when I found the bodies. - Are you fuckin' serious? Shit, sorry. - I don't think that's a good idea. - I transferred it to VHS when it started deteriorating and I think it's all right, but I got it. - I mean, can we watch it? - Well of course you can, why the hell do you think I'm sittin' here telling you all this? - Just really makes no sense, an old video tape, there's really nothin' on it. - Why? Huh? You think it'll trigger something? You want me to avoid it don't you? These kids here, they're offering me an opportunity to make sense out of some things, out of what happened. And maybe even bring some peace to some people who are still wonderin'. Nah, I can't pass a chance up like that, can I? Come on in here into the room and grab a seat. No, no not you. What? - I don't know what's on that tape. - Okay, so? - So head back to the cabin. - No, Molly said that I'm part of the crew and that I should know all the details. - Well Molly's not in charge of you. - Hey just let us watch it first, okay. We don't know what we're walking in on. You can watch whatever we pull for the doc. - Okay, you hypocrites. - You sure about this? - Yeah. Hey. Hey, what's up? Can I come in? Sure. - I saw you leave the house, you ah, you looked upset. Well yeah, 'cause of my fuckin' bitch of a sister. Want a drink? - Yeah. - You know, I've had tequila one other time before. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, at church camp. - Really? Yep. Your house seems pretty intense. I hate it here. Never wanted to move here. - Did your mom die? - Yeah. - Oh. That's a bummer. - Yeah. It sucked. When she died, I didn't have anything left. I knew I'd get stuck here in the fuckin' woods. I'm gonna die here you know? - That's, that's a depressing thought. - It's true. You think I like livin' in the fuckin' woods? I'm 19 years old and I drink a handle a week. Once you live here, you stay here forever. - I mean, you could leave, like, you can come with us if you have to. - Fuck that. My dad would kill me. If he didn't, my grandpa would. - Okay so he's scary, but like. - No you should be scared of him! Don't you see? He's evil. - Mr. Mahoney. Are you all right? - Dad. Dad, th, that's it! Turn off the tape, turn it off, turn it off! Dad look at me, it's Lance. It's okay, it's okay. - Get out of my house! - No dad look at me! - Get him the fuck out of my house! - You're okay, you're okay. Look at me, it's Lance, it's Lance. You're fine. I'm right here, you're safe, we're home. - Cathy! - It's okay. No. - Cathy, Cathy! - Mr. Mahoney. Cathy Cathy. You said you would never leave me again. - After my grandpa saw the bodies, just snapped. Went nuts. He did terrible things. - Like what? - Why did you leave me? You promised you would never le... Oh. - Okay, move, move. Dad right here, right here, it's okay. You're okay, you're okay, come on, come on. Come on. Get them outta here. - Come on, come on, - Let's go. come on, come on. - Go. - You're fine. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay. - So what happened? Not now Hannah. - Well, least we got what we came for, right? - Maybe we should go to bed. We can pack everything up in the morning. - You guys, we could pack everything up. Or we could finish the tape, totally up to you guys. - What the fuck Michael? - What? - You stole it? - It was sitting right there, it was easy. - Molly look, we can give it back. - Yeah, shut up! You can't just steal things out of people's homes, are you insane? - I thought you'd be happy. - We're not watching it. - Oh come on. No! No. You fucking beautiful son of a bitch. - Shotgun! - Can someone get the lights? God dammit. The hell is this? That's, that's Cathy. Who's Cathy? His wife. - What is she doing? - What the fuck? G, guys. That's right here, look. - We should just leave. - What? Open it! - Dearest Samuel, I regret that I must do this. I just cannot go on like this any longer. You are so cold. I'm sorry. I love you, Cathy. Shit. - Oh god. - Guys. Becca. Is that me? - Is this some kind of joke? - No I... - Do you think this is funny? - No! Do you? - No! - What the hell is that? - Holy Jesus. What the shit? Oh my god! - Okay, stop the tape! What is happening? Who are these people? - I don't, I don't know. - Hannah, go to our room. - What, why? - Right now! This has to be some kind of a joke, right? You guys are fucking with me. - Nobody's fucking with you Becca, that's us. - This has to be some kind of a joke, a prank. Like the time you pretended to break your neck or when you were filming Russell swimming and he pretended to drown. You're trying to scare me? - No one is trying to scare you, we have no fucking idea what's going on right now! - No. - Oh come on! God dammit! What the fuck? - Knock knock. Just thought I would come up here and tell y'all if you're thinkin' of packin' up and leaving tomorrow you can't. The storm is really comin' down outside. The roads are washed out. What's the matter? Y'all up to no good? Hmm. Oh I see. I see. You know, where I come from, if somebody houses you and feeds you and gives you there time and trust. You really should respect their wishes! Don't you think? - Why don't you tell us, what the fuck this is? - You still like girls do ya? What a waste. And I think you know what that is. What is going on? Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at me, look at me! Look at me stay here. Hey, somebody get me somethin'! Hey, hey, shh, hey, hey, hey, look at me, look at me. Don't look there, look at me. - Here. - Let it go, let it go. Put pressure, pressure, - Oh my god. pressure, hey, hey, hold it, hold it. Hey, stay with me, stay with me. Hey, right here, stay with me, okay, okay? Right here, it's gonna be okay. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck fuck. - Hannah! Hannah. No, no, no. - Hold it, hold it, hey, hey. Stay with me, stay with me. - Hannah, Hannah. Hannah! - All right? It's gonna be okay. Hey, hey, look at me, it's gonna be okay. Hey, hey, hey, right here. - See if you can call 911. - This can't be happening. Hey, it's gonna be okay. Hey, hey, hey. - Fuck! Hey, hey, listen to me. I need you to focus. Okay, I need you to focus. we're gonna get out of here, but I need your help, okay, all right? There's a landline in the house and I'm gonna call for help, okay? - No, no, no, no you can't leave. No, no Wendy listen! Everything's gonna be fine, but I've got to get to that landline if we're gonna get out of here, okay? - Okay. - All right, just stay here okay? - You can't leave me. - No, Wendy! Rebecca, Rebecca needs your help. Okay, she needs you all right? - Okay. - I'll be back I promise. I promise. - Okay. Hey, hey, shh, come here okay. They said to me to get you up. Let's get you up come on. Come on. - It's okay. Hey you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay, alright? - Oh my god, oh my god, Becca! Don't touch me!

What? - It's happening to you too. - What? Just give me a second. Russ! It's me! - It's a little ironic actually. Hmm, after that first incident at the pass I became obsessed. So obsessed, and I lost my marriage. Lost my relationship with my son but I needed to know the answers. After this last incident, there's one thing that I realize I don't take lightly and that's the responsibility of knowing that I'm the one that remains. - Great that's a cut. Go ahead and cut it. Thank you, so much. Off the record, these kids didn't show any signs of mental illness? - No, none. They all seemed fit as a fiddle. Wouldn't you agree? - I would, yeah. They were good kids. It's a shame what happened to 'em. - It sounds similar to the Tunguska incident in Russia, years ago. Where ultimately, people blamed nuclear testing. With the recent discovery of the military testing here in the 50s and 60s I think one could assume that maybe these kids suffered the same fate. Do you have any thoughts on that, or? Okay, well thank you for your time. I appreciate it, I have to go. I've got some research to do. Trying to find some crime scene photos but they're tough to come by. - Well, I might be able to help you out in that. I have some footage that I shot myself of the crime scene at the time. I could show you? - Dad, it's not gonna help. - I mean, yeah, that would be great, if it's not too much trouble. - No, no trouble at all. - Great, great, all right let's wrap this up guys. Let's get moving. Thank you.
