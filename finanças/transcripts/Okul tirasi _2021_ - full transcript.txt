Go! Move! Come on, get in! Everyone to their places! He took my towel! Come on, go! - Akif, turn the hot water on! - Okay. Get washing. Come on! Everyone in their place! You prick! Give me the pitcher, or I won't give you the soap. - Go away! - You son of a bitch! You made the water soapy, moron! My eyes are burning! Give me the pitcher. Fuck you! You messed up the water. What's going on here? I said, what's going on here? What's going on? Sir, he won't give me the pitcher. Sir, the soap... It looks like you don't want a hot shower. Mind your own business. Get on with your showers. Get to it! Bath prefect! Bath prefect! Bath prefect! - Are you the bath prefect? - Yes, sir. What kind of a bath prefect are you! I didn't see, sir. I was at the other end. Show some respect, dammit. Stop acting like animals. Turn on the cold water. Go on, hurry up. Fill the pitcher with cold water. Go on, fill it! Right, only cold water until the end of shower time. Pour it. That's it. Pour it. That's the way. Pour it. Cold water for the rest of bath time. Keep bathing. Come on, speed it up! Come on! Akif, turn it off! Dorm nine, out! Out, out! Go! Get your soaps! Get into bed! Go to your rooms! - Is this your room? - No, sir. Go to your room! Which one of you is Evliya? Me. - Which one is your bed? - This one. Put it on. Make your bed, quick! Get to your room! Lights out! Bedtime! Get in! Get to your room! Turn out the lights! Bedtime! Yusuf. - Yusuf. - What's up? - There are noises outside. - What noises? I don't know. It's the pigeons on the roof. How many times have I told you? - Yusuf. - What? Can I sleep in your bed tonight? People will talk. Go back to bed. Hey, get into bed! Yusuf. Just for tonight. Memo. Go back to bed. - Yusuf, the black trees are coming. - If you sleep, so will the black trees. Shut the fuck up! Go to sleep! BROTHER'S KEEPER Dorm, rise! Come on, get up! Get your friend up. Go to class. Wake up. Make your bed. Go to class. Go! What's in your hand? Stop that. Straighten your tie. Go to class. Memo, get up. We'll be late! Memo, come on! Whose pissy blanket is this? Man, what is that? You want to blame me for pissing on your own blanket? - Fuck you! - What's your problem? This asshole came and swapped his pissy blanket for mine. All the blankets are the same. How do you know it's his? Sacit, come here. Didn't you say Faruk and his roommates took my blanket? - I didn't say it was them. - Who then? Some people from dorm seven. I couldn't see their faces in the dark. Lying bastard! Wait, you forgot your pissy blanket. Come here. Come here, my boy. Come here! Come closer. Pick that up. Misbehave again and... Hey! Did I say you could leave? Misbehave again and you'll be punished. Got it? Take that to the laundry room! Why's he still asleep? Get up! Sir! He's sick. Are you faking because you've stood up all night. Get up, sleeping beauty. Where does it hurt? - My head hurts. I feel sick. - Speak up! I can't hear. - My head hurts. I feel sick. - Your head hurts and you feel sick? Maybe he's pregnant. Cut the sass, idiot! Get to class. You, too. Go! - You're Yusuf, aren't you? - Yes, sir. Yusuf, take your friend to the sickroom, find someone to give him medicine. - Then go to class. - OK, sir. Get to class. Wait here while I find the sickroom prefect. You guys wait here. I'll be right back. Out of the way. Where does it hurt? He had a headache. Sit him up a little. - Aren't there any other pills? - Yes, but I don't know what they're for. Memo, open your mouth. Memo, take the aspirin. It'll make you feel better. You should go. Maybe you'll make it to breakfast. Go on. I'll be here. Go, I'll be here. The state... gives you a place to sleep. You are well-fed. You get a bath once a week. You get pocket money every month. And yet you're still complaining! At your age, we had to walk 10km to school every day and yet we never complained. Your appearance, the way you dress, the way you stand... should immediately tell anyone, even from 100m away that you're a student of this school! You need to set a good example to the outside world. There are thousands of boys out there who wish they were in your place! So, you must eat and go to bed at the right time. You must work hard. You must be a valuable citizen to this country and nation. Applause! That's enough, OK! Kenan, bring me that student please. - Did he really get all the way to Istanbul? - Sure, he even went to a brothel there. Quiet, idiot! You enjoy standing in the cold? Get back to your place! Children... Some of you still have long hair and disheveled uniforms. There seems to be a craze for long hair. Who's going to see your hair out here in the sticks? Huh? Everyone is to have a short back and sides! - Is that clear? - Yes! No running! How many times have I told you? Do it again and I'll expel you! Go to your class! - Sir... - Go to your class, go! Move it! It's been minutes since the bell! - What's this? - Nothing, sir. Take it out. Throw it down the toilet. Run! Throw it in. I want to see it go down the toilet. Flush it down. Wash your hands there. Smoking at your age? Are you morons? OK, come here. Come on. Back to your place. Head up. Head up. Up! Head up. Now go and wait for me at the vice principal's office. Run! Sir, I swear it won't happen again. - I said run! - Sir, I've been suspended. Head up again. Head up. Head up. Head up. Now get the hell out of here. Run! - Sir... - Run! - Sir, my friend... - Get to your class! Go! Run! How many times do I have to say? Into the classroom! Here! - Reşat Koca. - Here! - Caner Turhan. - Here! - Fırat Arvas. - Here! Mehmet Solmaz. Mehmet Solmaz? He's off school, sir. In the sickroom. Sir, Memo's got TB, cancer, cirrhosis, tetanus, AIDS, measles, typhoid, polio. Musa, you can be sure he's not as sick as you are. OK, quiet! Copy down what I'm writing on the board. Right, anyone remember where we left off last class? Grammar mistakes. So we'll carry on with grammar mistakes. 'I'll scare you to death again.' What's wrong here? 'I'll scare you to death again.' Reşat! Yes, you. Stand up. Tell us the grammar mistake in the first sentence. - Nothing. - Nothing What? - Nothing's wrong. - Sit down. What's wrong with the first sentence is the logic of it. It should be 'I'll scare you to death.' Why? Because if you say "again", it means we have more than one life. Do we? No, we have only one life. No, sir. I swear Faruk has nine lives. He gets so many beatings and he still doesn't die. Right, onto the second sentence. 'All state and private schools are closed thanks to snow.' I wonder what the mistake is here? So, where's the mistake here? Sir, will schools here close as well? Sit! I thought you were going to answer the question. Don't make me take one of your last two lives! - Will they? - Yes, sir. Will they? That's for regular places. Here, it snows half the year. If we closed every time it snowed you'd take three years to learn to read. - Sir, Ahmet actually took three years! - Fuck off! No swearing! Sir, I didn't even speak Turkish when I started school. Don't worry, some people still don't, as we can see... Boys, is there a window open somewhere? It's cold inside. - How long has the heating been off? - Since this morning, sir. Put your coats on. Don't catch cold. I thought the heating was on. Look, I did 17 hours on duty and I'm only down for 13. Then you forgot to sign the log. Impossible. It's the first thing I do! I've been put on duty three weekends in a row. - Sir. - Three weeks! What? - Sir, Mehmet's really sick. - Which Mehmet? You sent him to the sickroom this morning. - What's wrong with him? - He threw up, sir. - So, have you given him any medicine? - Yes, sir. OK, if you've done that, what else can I do? Sir, there's a fight on the third floor. These boys are out of control! - Who's fighting? - Seventh grade, sir. Into your classrooms! Move it! Get into class, animals! Move it! The bell has rung and you're still here! Get into class! Into your classrooms! Today we're going to learn about Turkey's geographical regions. Who's going to show us... Sit down, we've started! Listen to me! Quiet! Who's going to show us where we are on the map? - Me, miss. - Me, miss! - Me, miss. Me! - Come and show us. - So, where are we? - Here, miss. - Which region are we in? - The Kurdish region. Sit down. There's no such thing as the Kurdish region. It's the Eastern Anatolian Region. The Eastern Anatolian Region is in the east of Turkey. It has an altitude of over 2000m. Who threw these papers? Behave! I'm trying to start the lesson. Yusuf! What are you looking at? What have I been saying? Stand up! List all of Turkey's geographical regions! How many regions are there? Sit down. Don't come to class without a notebook and pencil again. Hand a sheet and a pencil to your classmate. OK, what about population density? It's dense, miss! - Why? - Because everyone has 8-10 children! - How many are you in your family? - Nine, miss. OK, sit down. Quiet! The population density is low, because it's a region of emigration. Unemployment, lack of industrialization and a strong workforce give rise to mass urban migration. - Whoa, the glass broke! - Back to your places! - Miss, I'll help. - It's fine. Move away. Hey! - Get back to your classrooms! - Miss, we don't have class. Then go play somewhere else! Go on! OK, back to your places! Leave it there. Come here! Quiet! Stop serving, Suat. What's that in your hand? What are you hiding under the tray? Why did you take extra bread? Answer me! Why the extra bread? I'm not full otherwise, sir. You think these people are idiots? No food for you today since you stole your friends' share. Put that down and get out! No one eats anyone else's share! You can carry on, Suat. - Has everyone been served, Suat? - Yes, sir. Stand up! We pray for more, not less! For us to eat, not spill! Thanks be to God! Long live our country and nation! - Enjoy the meal! - Thanks! He doesn't have a fever. Memo, try a bit harder. - Are you relatives? - No, friends. - Are you from the same village? - No. - Memo. - Leave it. He's not eating. Memo, come on! Sir, Mehmet's really sick. He can't speak, he can't eat. - Which one is he? - A boy from fifth grade. Let me deal with this. Come with me. How's Memo? Principal... one of the kids... Selim, can you find that student and bring him to me? - How is the heating problem going? - I'm working on it, Principal. Working on what? It's been hours! The pipe was already cracked. Now it's completely broken. - So, what are we going to do? - As the pipe to the boiler is broken and it's a closed circuit, the boiler won't work. I told you many times that we should change it. OK, enough! Get back to work. Principal, your car needs snow tires. These ones won't make it through winter. Oh, I don't know. Looks like we are a bit late. A bit. But you're driving kids around. You don't want problems down the line. Principal, we can use the revolving fund to change the tires if you'd like. Can we really? Well, not really but if you give the OK, I can make it look like we're getting them for the school van. OK, you're the accountant. - Take care of it. - OK, Principal. - Principal. - Come here. - What's your name? - Reşat, sir. - Why did you break the window? - It broke when I was closing it. Look at me! Take your hand away! Do it! Look at me! Clear up the mess! Principal, one of our boys is sick. - He's been smoking wet tobacco. - No, sir. It's not like that. Then take him to the sickroom and give him a painkiller. We've done all that, but the boy's worse now. He needs to see a doctor. Then call Murtaza. He can take him. Right, I'll call Murtaza. There's no signal, of course. Murtaza, how are you? Fine, thanks. Where are you? One of our boys is sick. We need to get him to a hospital. Can't you come back? Why are you in the village mid-week? Can't you find a way? OK, I get it Murtaza. Go get permission so that you can be next your friend. We'll take him when the driver comes back. Go around the edge. I just mopped there. And wipe your feet first! Come in! - I'll ask them to refer me. - Is it that serious, deputy? Terrible. I can't sleep. I say my back hurts, he tells me to do exercise. I say my chest hurts, he says exercise. If I exercise, what the fuck is he going to do? It makes life hell. I'll go visit my parents in Ankara. We'll see, the change of air might be good. Sir, Mr. Selim sent me. - So? - My friend's sick and uh... What do you want? I have to sit with him and I was going to ask you for uh... You want permission. It's only to get off classes, you know. Mahmut! - Mahmut! - Yes, sir? What's up with the heat? We've been freezing all day! - I'll fix it soon hopefully. - Hopefully! "I'll fix it." These are the only words they know! It takes forty of them to make one thing work. They're a waste of space, Sir. If the heater wasn't down, we wouldn't know that they work here. We have to drag them from their homes. You have no idea. They're hard to deal with. - What's your name? - Yusuf, sir. Yusuf, I can't give you permission. You know why? - Why, sir? - Because I'm off duty. Can someone off duty give permission? - I don't know, sir. - He can't. - Now go and see Mr. Hasan... - Mr. Hasan's in town, sir. Then go sit with your friend, Yusuf. If you have an unexcused absence at the end of term, come and see me. - OK, sir. - Shut the door. - If you're here, I'll go to class. - Go. I have permission. - How is he? Has he eaten anything? - No, sir. - Does he have any cuts or bruises? - I haven't seen any, sir. He doesn't have a fever. If you go through all the trouble of having a sickroom... at least hire a pretty nurse. Right? Huh? - What's your friend's name? - Mehmet, sir. Mehmet. - Mehmet! Can you hear me? - Sir, he can't speak. - Do you know his roommates? - Sir, we're in the same room. - Was he OK during the night? - Yes. - Sir... - Does he have any cuts or bruises? I haven't seen any, sir. Sir, Mr Hamza gave them a punishment in the baths last night. - What punishment? - Washing with cold water. Come on! Explain properly! Sir, Memo and two friends were messing around. Then Mr Hamza came and gave them the cold-water punishment. So, they washed in cold water till bath time ended. Fuck! Why even bother carrying the damn phone? Hamza! Hamza! Do you have a minute? What's up, Selim? What's wrong with the boy? - He must've caught cold. - How so? But he doesn't have a fever. I hear you gave him a cold-water punishment last night. - It's nothing. - Come on! In this weather? It happens all the time. It's minus 35C outside! 15 minutes of cold water would freeze you to death. Who's ever frozen to death, for God's sake? OK, but the boy can't even move. Look, I know these boys. You turn your back and they switch on the hot water. - They used cold water until the end. - Oh, please! It's true. We were students once. I know them. Sir, the bath prefect stood over them till bath time ended. I didn't tell the bath prefect to do that. Off you go. Boys, look this way. Take notes. Last night I gave those boys a cold-water punishment. Yes, sir. Did you stand over them till bath time ended? - Yes. - I see. - Who told you to stand over them? - Sir, you... The boy can't lift his head, idiot! Lower that hand! Hello? Hello. Murtaza? What's the story, Murtaza? Can't you come back? Hello? Do you hear me? Yusuf, see if your friend has his ID on him. - No, he doesn't, sir. - OK, go to the dorm, find his ID and bring it back here. OK, sir. It didn't work. Open the trunk let me see if there are any chains. It's unlocked, pop it open. There aren't. Ready? OK. One, two, three. Push! Push! Push! Push! Push! This isn't going to work. OK, stop. Leave it. This isn't going to work. Maybe if we clear the snow here with the boys. Sure, let's try but... - But where do we even start? - Yes. How to clean this massive driveway? Look, this is snow on top, but... isn't there solid ice underneath? Even if we drove off, we'd get stuck halfway. The snow's knee-deep. We can't keep the boy waiting. - What should we do? - Who else at school has chains? Hasan has chains, but he's off today as luck would have it. Chains would be no use anyway. We'd get stuck halfway. - Yusuf! Let's get your friend out. - Sir, aren't you coming to class? Take the class to the dining hall and give the cook a hand, OK? I'll come and take the register. Yusuf, run and open the door. - Won't it open? - No, sir. - Sir, I'll go get the key. - Run! Can you please give me a hand? He's so heavy. In you go. In you go. Yusuf, let's cover him up. - Where were you? - In class, sir. Why were you in class? And taking the key. Lift him up. It seemed best to lock the door when you left. Suppose there's an emergency? I can't handle an emergency. I just dole out aspirin. - Didn't you get the car out? - No, sir. We got stuck in the snow. He doesn't have a fever. - How long's the boy been like this? - Since morning, Principal. - What's his name? - Mehmet, sir. Mehmet. Can you hear me? Open your eyes. - Sit him up. - Lift his head, my boy. Lift him gently. The boy has no strength in him. OK, lay him down. Easy. Careful. You can't get a signal, sir. You can when you stand on this chair. I'll show you, sir. You put it here, climb onto it and talk like this. I'm calling from the boarding school... Burhan Demir, the principal. One of our students here is sick. We urgently need an ambula... 44. You mean the patient? He's 10 or 11. - 11! - 11. He's lying here passed out. No, he's unconscious. He can't move, he can't speak. Miss, this is an emergency so we need an ambul... I'm listening. OK, we turn the patient on his side. That stops him biting his tongue and keeps his airway open. OK. The regional boarding school. Hello? Fuck! Hello? OK, thanks. We'll be waiting. Hey, Hamza. They use sleds in the villages. You think we could try with the boy? Well, yes. That's true. People from the villages, you know, get around on sleds. - But I mean, it's kind of far. - It's a long way. And I don't know, it's a bit cold. - The boy would freeze. - He would. Then we'd have to deal with those people. Hello, Bekir? Hello. Thanks, I'm fine. Bekir, one of our boys is sick. Thanks, man. He's lying here half-conscious. No. But he doesn't have a fever. If he had food poisoning, wouldn't other boys have it, too? What's the last thing he ate? Sir, we had okra and rice at 6 pm. - Okra and rice at 6 pm yesterday. - Sir! Just rice, sir. He doesn't like okra. He doesn't like okra. Just rice. Has he vomited? - Yes, sir. - Yes, he's vomited. Any falls or crashes? Not that we know of. Open the window, let some air in. Sure, if we could, but... We already called an ambulance. No, they say all vehicles are occupied. Bekir, can't you help us out? Thanks, Bekir. Goodbye. - Does he have any illness you know of? - No. I don't know, sir. Sir! He wasn't OK last night when Mr. Kenan brought him to bed. - What? Brought him from where? - I don't know. I was half-asleep. Go get Kenan. No, wait! One of you call him. Talk to me, my boy! Why are you crying? Come here. Ask him why he's crying. Why are you crying? [in kurdish] Why are you crying? Why are you crying? I want to go home. Sir, he wants to go home. So do I. But we can't do anything about it. Go watch cartoon in the TV room. Get up. Off you go. Help! Spookreme Court is in session. Young man! Watching TV in school hours is forbidden. The principal wants six cups of tea. We are prosecuting Casper because he doesn't follow our rules. He doesn't scream, he doesn't do anything to spook people. He tries to make friends. Your Honour and jury members, now I will reveal the irrefutable evidence. This event has occurred on 25th of April, on Maine Street. How many? Mommy! Mommy! A baby! That is my baby! - Oh God! Everyone else just slipped... - It was my luck to fall! Try moving your ankle up and down. Right, OK. No broken bones. No, if there were, he wouldn't be able to uh... Would he? No, he wouldn't be able to sit still. Where do you want me to mop, principal? Off you go. Kenan, go easy on it. What's going on? Mehmet, are you OK? The boy doesn't have a fever. What's happened to him? Here, take this glass. Yes, Bekir? Thanks a lot, Bekir! Hard to say. He's just lying there. OK, Bekir. Goodbye. Thanks. Give me that glass. Here, sir. Your tea. They said to turn him on his side. It's to keep his airway open and avoid him potentially biting his tongue. - Kenan, were you on duty last night? - That's right. Was anything wrong with him then? I woke up at one point. He was awake. He said he felt sick. I thought nothing of it and left. Kenan, you were seen bringing the boy to bed late at night. - What were you doing with him? - What are you insinuating? I heard someone banging on the door in the middle of night and I woke up. I went down. He was shivering at the door. I asked where he'd been. He said he'd had a bath in the boiler room. Had a shower in the boiler room? So, the boys sometimes take showers in the boiler room because there's always hot water. How long have you known about it? Well, sir... I guess taking showers once a week don't do it for the boys. Right, Selim? Great! Let anyone who feels like it take a shower in the boiler room! - Didn't you ask the boy? - I did, but he didn't answer. He was so cold I just put him to bed. Kenan, you could've reported it when I took over your shift. Report everything and when would I teach? - OK, but he's... - See the state the boy's in? You were on duty. How did the boy get out? No idea. I checked, everyone was asleep so I locked up and went to my room. You're responsible for the boys all night! Classes all day, duty all night, four hours' sleep! I'm not a machine! For God's sake! Didn't you have the keys? How did the boy get out? I don't know. It's your job to know. You're on duty! I'm a teacher, sir. Not a guard. Wasn't it their shower day last night? Uh, shower day... Yes, sir. Of course it was their shower day, but... Be careful jumping over the fences, OK? Don't let anyone see you. Be quick. And tell your mum not to use it all at once. The principal sent for you. Come on, let's go. - You know smoking is banned. - Fuck that. Have one. Who's going to see out here? Selim. - There could be people watching us. - Let them watch themselves! Selim. If the school van was here, we'd have got through the snow, huh? Don't you agree? I mean, it has big tires, chains. Huh? Going to get cheese, for God's sake! Right? Know what, Selim? Once you have leverage, you can send for cheese, nappies... You know what he said? The ass wipes had to be scented! What would anyone with leverage be doing out here? He did something to get banished here. You have a point. No! What do you mean the snow plough flipped over? Look, the boy's sick! What are we supposed to do? We already called an ambulance and the guys got stranded. Are we supposed to let the boy die? Selim, give me a cigarette. Why do you let the boys take showers? - What showers? - Don't give me that, Mahmut! You're out of line! Why do you let them? - I swear I know nothing about it. - Bullshit! Principal, he doesn't do the night shift. That's Akif's job. - Have you fixed the heating? - I'm working on it. I called a plumber. - And? - He can't come before Monday. - So, what happens now? - I insisted but he said he'd do his best. OK, get back to work. And send Akif here. Sir, can I go back to class? Get those boys who were punished to come to the sickroom. - What are their names? - Sir, I know those bastards. - Go to your class! - Yes, I'll send them over. Don't answer back! Brat! You menace! - Can I have your phone? - What phone? Come on! - Don't let anyone see. - OK. [in kurdish] Hello? Yusuf! How nice to hear your voice! How are you? Fine, mum. How are you? My precious. If you're OK, then so are we. Your dad has a bad back again so he hasn't been to work. - We made him a wooden floor bed. - Mum. What is it, precious? Mum, my friend's really sick. Never mind your friends. Put your mind to more serious things. You know our situation. You're our only hope. Make sure you study well. I have so much on my plate, all the kids... I lost you, I can't hear you... Hello, Yusuf? Hello? Yusuf? Look, can't you help? Because it's really an emergency. I don't know, maybe the director could make a call. If a snow plough could be fixed, because we're all set with a car. I already have called and they said they couldn't come. Can't you do anything? OK. OK, thank you. - Was it you who got punished? - Yes, sir. Well? What happened? Sir, I was trying to get the scoop. Mehmet wanted it as well. I asked him to give me the scoop. When he didn't, I asked him again. - When the teacher heard us... - Hey, come on! You were strangling each other. What's happened to your friend? Now, look. You're friends. If you know something, tell me. We don't, sir. Yusuf said Mehmet was sick this morning. Don't lie! Sir, Mehmet was asleep when we left this morning. Didn't you wake up when he came in at night? Came in from where, sir? - What the hell got into you? - What did I do? Kenan smuggles the boy in and it's OK, but I'm guilty, huh? You punish the boys and accuse me? Come on! OK, I punished them. He can't move just because he has a cold? If you saw the boy was sick, you should've got him a doctor! If I'd known what happened, I'd have taken him to the doctor. Known about what? The boy's sick. Take him! I did. I took him to the principal, but he sent him here. I didn't. I said call Murtaza. I did. You sent him to get cheese. - What? I did? - Yes. He was going to the village, so I told him to bring back some cheese. For God's sake! You boys wait outside. Go! Careful with your belongings. - Why drag us into this, twat? - Fuck you! I will fuck you up 24/7, Yusuf! I didn't give these fuckers away! Stop that fighting! Go get clean sheets from the laundry room. Hurry up! Get the best ones! Nothing shabby. Hello. - What do you want? - Mr Selim wants clean sheets. Plus, he asked for good ones. - Sure this isn't some prank? - I swear it's not. - Where's Mr Selim? - In the sickroom. With the principal and other teachers. - The principal? - Yes. - I'll check up on you! - Go ahead. - Is the inspector coming? - I don't know. - Bring me the old ones. - OK. Did you let this boy take a shower in the boiler room? - Yes, principal. - Why, Akif? They said they had been impure so I let them in. I thought it would be a sin to let them go around unclean. - Who's they? Who else was there? - There were two of them, sir. - Was it one of them? - No, it was a smaller boy. Then, we ran here. When we knocked on the door, Akif was asleep. Memo hadn't had a proper shower earlier. Then? Then what? We said we wanted a shower. He said no. We said we were unclean. He said we'd get him in trouble and kicked us out. Then we gave him a pack of cigarettes and he let us in. That's not true, sir. - Then what? - Then we came in here. Then we got in the shower. We were messing around. Memo tried to grab the showerhead from me. I didn't let him have it. I banged an iron thing with my hand and it fell off. Then, the pipe broke and fell on Memo's head. Then what? We tried to climb back up the sheets we had used to go down. I was able to climb, but Memo couldn't. So, I told him to knock on the door and go back inside. And? We know the rest. Come here. You too. What made you want to have a shower in the middle of the night? Sir, Memo had wet himself. This way. Keep going. This way. Wait, hold on. Bring the stretcher! - Onto the stretcher. - One, two, three... VACCINES ARE HERE TO PROTECT YOU! Move aside! Selim, get in the ambulance with him. - Out of the way of the ambulance! - Out of the way! Don't block the ambulance! Move aside! Don't go away! Everyone to the courtyard. Yes, hurry up! Everyone to the parade ground! I'm talking to you! Get to the parade ground! Come on, move! Clear out! Take your soap! Stop! Three more people!
