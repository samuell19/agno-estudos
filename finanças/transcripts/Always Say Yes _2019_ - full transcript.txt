I couldn't sleep today. I must have slept like 2 hours at most. I couldn't concentrate. I just thought and thought. No bad thoughts. just the opposite. So many good things in such a short time, and this date. Today it's 2 years. How time flies! How things happen! Sometimes you think you can't control your destiny. But I think that sometimes you just need to help it out a little bit. To give it a little push in the direction you want. I made a decision. I've made plenty of them, Good and bad decisions. Some of them without thinking. But those are the ones you think are the most important. Afriend of mine from here, Mexico City, told me: "Are you man enough?' 'Do you have the balls? He meant that there's people who jump without thinking, and others who never do it. I didn't give it a thought. I came, I came to pose naked. To share all of my deep kinkiness. To expose myself, to feel that I existed. To be seen. Not to feel ashamed. It all started in Hermosillo. When my friend didn't arrive, Well, with some benefits. Not such a friend, or well... Carlos didn't have the balls. He didn't dare. He didn't arrive to the station. I came by myself. Things happened. And I met a lot of people. A lot of people. Hi. I'm Hector, and I'm a big fan of you. I plan to go with a friend of mine to Mexico City this weekend, and it would be a huge honor to pose for you. He says I'm cute, but I don't believe him. I hope you tell me otherwise. I don't know. You undress yourself to be seen by others, and to see yourself, I'm very curious about it. I'm a mecatronics engineer, and honestly I don't have a gym body, and I want to live new things. I've lived few things here, and I always repeat the same things. Hi, Hector. How are you? Thank you very much for your interest. I have a thing for kids from the provinces. You have like an unfinished thing. I don't know. I'm bored to death with rich kids. You're like a mix of innocence and clumsiness, but I can see in you a little perversion. I really have a good feeling about this. I think you must be really horny. Tell me how do you want to do it. Call me when you're in town. I work from Monday to Friday, but! keep my weekends for my photos. So, tell me when you're here, and we sort it out. Oh, and don't use deodorant when you come to meet me. Bye.

We're used to it This job must be so much fun. Isn't it? You get to see plenty of boys. Plenty of handsome boys. Do you like it? You get used. Do you have a girlfriend or boyfriend? No. I live with my mom. I was coming to town with a friend, this weekend. But he fell back at the last minute. You're from here? No, I'm from Xalapa. Xalapa? I'm Hector. Pleased to meet you. Don't you have at least five minutes to come with me to the sauna? I'm all alone here in the city. I'd love to have someone to talk with, to tell me where to go. What do you say? I like women. So, what's the problem? I'm only inviting you to talk. I'd bet your's is hairy. Do you prefer them hairy? Hairy guys? How is it? I'd bet yours is hairy. Girls love it when you you are groomed. Take off your t-shirt. Just for a minute. I bet girls like you alot. They haven't complaint. Are you going to comb me? Abit. I like the pubic hair of men. Do you want to go to the sauna? Just for a minute. Justa moment. Ok. Let's go. Do you like manly sweat? - Why? -1 had a long trip. What do I smell like? You smell like you had a trip. Like a male. My mom is going to Veracruz this weekend to see her mom. I'm going to be home alone. - Are you inviting me? - We could do something. Do you live nearby? Like half an hour away. It could be. I'd love to. I already have plans, but I can make the time. I arrived too early to this place, didn't I? I've heard a lot about these baths. Yes, but... the good part starts later. Really? At what time? I heard it's packed with handsome boys, from all places, foreigners, from around here... Is that true? Yes. It also depends on the day of the year. And do you like working here? To see them, to serve them? Is it similar to this? Sometimes, Usually I focus on my duties. Do you like it? A lot. I'd love to have a massage now. Do linterrupt? I've got to go. Won't you stay? I have things to do. - You want a massage? - Yes. - That's right. - OK. OK. I'm going to massage you, first lying down and softly. Then you'll tell me if we rise the intensity. - Are you comfortable? - Yes, I'm comfortable. - Are you from here? - No. - From Hermosillo. - Never been there. - Tell me if it hurts. - It's perfect. Thanks. That's good. I'had a heavy trip. How's that? I came to the city just for the weekend. And what did you come for? Just to pose. To have fun. I ALWAYS HAVE THE NEED TO BE SEEING NEW DICKS, NEW BUTTOCKS, NEW EVERYTHING, RIGHT? What did you come for? It's along story, but I came to pose for a photographer, an erotic session. His name is Jonas Serrano. Do you know him? No, no idea. Erotic? Yes. I was coming with... afriend from Hermosillo, but he couldn't make it, but well... what stopped me from coming by myself? And had you been here before? With my parents, like 10 or 12 years ago. But by myself, no. It's the first time. You're really good with massages. - Is it OK if I touch you below? - No problem. - Can you turn around. - Yes. I'll put a towel below you. Is the pressure good, or do you want me to do it harder? Everything is perfect. So are you going to pose for these photographs? I hope so. My god, this is very nice. You're cute enough for the photos. I know my body is far from Adonis, but that's exactly what I'm looking forward to. To do something that I wouldn't dare to do back in Hermosillo. Why wouldn't you? I don't know. People back there tend to have a very narrow idea about sexuality, male freedom. I don't know. I feel that I wouldn't be able to do it back there. OK. What about you? You must have a lot of fun giving this service to plenty of men, don't you? Plenty of men with hot bodies, toned up, not as much as you, but, yes, once in a while acute one arrives. Oscar wasn't lying when he said you were just the one to give this service, - He said 507 - Yes. Do you like this? Ilove it. Do you know how to give massages? I don't think I'd be at your level. I see you can be a fast learner, though. You may also touch, if you want. I mean, if you like. - Is it good? - Very good. It's very nice. No one had touched you like this before? No. Do you have a girlfriend? No. - Boyfriend? - Neither. - You're single! - How about you? The same. It's more fun this way. Absolutely. - I'm going to apply a little bit of oil. - Go ahead. - Is it OK? - Of course! If you don't like it, just tell me. Oh, Aldo, it's fine! I really needed this. It was a very long trip. How did you travel? I took the midnight bus in Hermosillo. I arrived this morning. Here to the city. I'm going to get on top of you. OK? Do whatever you want. Let's see if we fit. This way I have more control over the body. You're really good at this job. - Do you like it? - I love it! You remind me a client I once had. From Sonora as well? No, but he was cute. Was he as horny as I am? I had never had a client like this. - Isn't this normal to happen? - No. - No? - No. I couldn't help it. Sorry. It doesn't bother me. And are you going to pose naked for these photos? Oh, yeah, Totally. I'm a bit nervous, you know? I think this is doing me very well To relax myself, To become confident with my body. It's going to help. You'll see. Thank you. I'd love to pose for photos as well. - Really? - I've thought about it. - You've never done it? - No. And are you curious as well? Yes, I think it'd look good. It's not the same to take pictures yourself than having someone taking pictures of you, Tu pose before the lense of someone with that theme and experience. The perspective people have is interesting. Absolutely. - I'm almost done. - Yes. I enjoyed it so much, that time... Time went flying away. Yes, it was nice. And it's on my behalf. - Really? - Yes. Thank you. Your moans were my tip. Wow. I've been really well recieved in this city. Really? I hope you come back soon. I'll totally come back here. It'd be nice to see the photo session. I'd be pleased to show them to you. - Are you in Instagram? - Yes. Give it to me later. Of course, let me get dressed and I'll seek you. I may be busy, but.. - I'll give it to Oscar. - Alright. - Did you like it? - I loved it. You're welcome. Carlos. I'm here. Here at the Alameda. It's been such a good evening. If you just knew everything I've done. I'll tell you later every detail. I'd love it if you were here. I'll call you tomorrow when I'm back. Take care. Do you like this? Kiss me. That was nice. Close the door. I REALIZED THAT LIFE IS WORTH ONLY FORTHE PLEASURES THAN CAN GIVE YOU THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS BULLSHIT AND THAT IF ONE IS NOT HAPPY, BECAUSE OF A STUPID Hi, dude. So you're fucking half the city, ain't you? All those fucking Chilangos. I'm a bit jealous. Please, forgive me. I don't dare, dude. I can't say yes, always, to everything. They know me here, I've got a father, afarm. I like to suck cocks and to be fucked in the ass, but I want to have children, Hector. Awife.. You know that. Ok. I'm sorry. Bye, dude. Shit! Where am I?

I thought you'd be more into narcocorridos or something like that. - Because of the hat, isn't it? - Yes. My head aches a lot. Do you have some water? Yes. Thank you. I remember leaving the bar by myself. I don't remember saying goodbye to you, I was just walking, arriving to the Angel. You phoned me. Don't you remember? -1 gave you my number? - Yes, Oh, shit.

How long have you been here? 7 years, I'd love to live here. You're going to live here, I'm sure. I think you're not made for living surrounded by people who are afraid of freedom. It's OK. It's my first time here, Of course I'm a bit afraid. - Afraid? - May I have a smoke? - Yes, just open the window. Well, you don't seem very afraid, as far as I see. Would you remind me your name? Isaias. I think I was sitting at the bar, and then I saw you. Everybody loves the cock when it's erect. But Ilike it like this. Still, asleep. Resting. Let's say, a bit.. Vulnerable. - What was your name, again? - Isaias. Isaias. When did you undress me? As soon as we arrived. I can't sleep with someone dressed. It becomes too hot. Give me a drag. What do you do fora living? I'm an actor. An actor? In the theatres. Love naked bodies. - May I have a shower? - No. You smell like a lot of things. Besides, my roomies would notice, I see.

I hate Guanajuato. The only good thing about the countryside is that you can escape. Country people is very stigmatized. How's that? That everyone is prude, that they're scared about sexuality. Let everyone live their lives, But that's not the reason why lwant to leave. I'd love to.. I don't know, give this city a try. To work... Or let this city give you atry. But, well... - Are you leaving? - Yes, And how do I leave? Wait 10 minutes after I left, then you leave. Take care, will you? Thanks. And, we didn't fuck. We just cuddled and kissed fora long time. Take care. Thanks. You too. Hi?Yes? What was your name? Oh, yeah, right. Hernan. Sorry, Hector. Yeah, the guy from Obregon. Isn't it? Hey, I've just received your messages. Well, the truth is that last night was crazy, and I'm with a huge hangover. So, I hope you're OK, but the truth is that [won't be able to have the session with you. I had a shoot at Tulum with some very cute guys, some influencers, and to be honest, it's incredible. Do you know Tulum? You'd love it. Really. But, maybe next time.
