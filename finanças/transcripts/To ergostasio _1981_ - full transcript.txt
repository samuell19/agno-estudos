What have you got? What you see. How many do you want? - I want 10 pieces. - We'll weight them. No weights. How much each skin? They are big ones. How much the kilo? 45 drachmas. That's too expensive. It's the market price. Someone from Salonika wants to buy 200 skins now. He'll take everything I can stock during the winter. - You want them? - I haven't got the money. As you like... Don't trust foreigners. Set a good price. I'll take them now. How much? 500 drachmas each. I can sell them, 2500 drachmas each. Give me 2000 and they are yours. 1000. So that I get a small profit after tanning. No, 2000 is cheap. Look, I have to repair the damages at the factory. You used to ask 400 drachmas for each skin. - Want pigskins? - No use to me. As you like... - Morning! - Where' ve you been? I slowed down production... Got any skins? Panaghiotis stock them all. He got's a monopoly that's why he asks 2000. Prices have gone up. In the old days, we sold them for a drink. Nowadays, imported leather is much cheaper and better. Do you know how much it costs to keep a herd? No loans...pastures are scarce... Forrest guards, bailiffs, secret police, county police... they all hunt us they want to arrest us. It's all in vain, Aris. It'll fall down, son. I'll fill it up with cement. It's very strong inside. Did you get skins? He asks 2500 drachmas for each skin. How much? That's what a foreigner gives him. That's what he says anyway. The ruffian we kept him going up to now! I offered him 1000 and he refused. What are going to do? Shit! Pray to God that the factory falls down. Then we shan't need his skins. It won't fall down. See how strong the cement is. See? - Will it hold? - For many years. What about skins? I'll go to the big farmers. Paraskevas is sending a herd to the slaughterhouse. He asked me to accompany them... 2000 a day. I'll talk to him. Let's go, Aris, it's late. I hope that it doesn't rain. Katina!, Valentini! Where the hell have they gone? So, you are back. - Where's your mother? - At the fields. Are you going to town? A girl? Why? Am I a child still? I didn't say anything... I only asked. A man must have a lot of women before his marriage. You never stay at home! The potato crop will be full of worms. And the factory is falling down. - Can't you do anything? - I'll do something. We should get an engineer. Everything has turned against us. God is merciful. Something will come up. I'll buy skins from Paraskevas. - He's the biggest crook. - Naturally. Why don't you find an engineer? Pay him anything he asks, to save the factory. "Anything he asks"... I'm not laughing, woman. I borrowed money to buy the cement. I'll work. People will say that I can't support my family. Women pickers wanted at Karapano's estate... at Panaghia Faneromeni. Come to the city hall square to sign up! Women pickers wanted at Panaghia Faneromeni. Wages: 600 drachmas a day... Free food. - Where's your mother? - Don't know. - Did you see her? - She went out. - Where? - At the square. Get out! We don't need money, thank God! My wife doesn't have to work. Our roof is leaking... Let me repair the factory and everything will be fine. To your kitchen! A woman is like cow. Let her get away once and you lost her. If you want to live a decent life, study! Otherwise you'll work in the fields all day. I'll be a film star... Good morning, Mr. Papyros. I brought you the leathers. Don't you have any 1,5 thick? I don't make them so thin. People don't want thick ones. They're out of fashion. Won't you take them? I'll keep them, as a favour to you... on deposit! But only peasants want them. Know him? I saw him passing... The leathers for the bags. - The colour? - Perfect! Look at it! They all buy plastic bags, now. People prefer them... Plastic is cheap. This needs skill. - How much? - 370 drachmas a meter. I'll pay you next week. Anytime. You with your factory, don't need money. Your attention, please! One...two... At Afentakis's cafe, an official from the Ministry... will give a lecture "Loans from the EEC". He will explain the conditions... for loans and government grants. Are you coming to the cafe? He'll tell us how to get a loan. You go! The cops want us all there, you know that! I don't want them nosing around you. Bloody thugs... The fixing of minimum prices is adjusted according... to the common marketing organizations... so as to ensure reasonable prices for the producers... equivalent to those in the national market... during a transitional period which differs per product. The maximization of the profits is completely ensured by the general procedure for equalization of the prices... which will have a benevolent influence on the gross profit Special adjustments are designed to mitigate the effects. of the fixing of minimum prices. The difference as to the communal prices is calculated. Charges, quotas and tariffs affecting trade and exports... are reduced or increased accordingly... within the framework of communal trade policy. I want to stress the importance of the loans of EEC... in two main fields of our economy. Agriculture and industry. We have here some explanatory pamphlets... Which illustrate the advantages to farmers... and procedure for obtaining long-terms loans. I have a tannery. I want to ask how to get a loan. - How big? - Small. There are grants for industrial development. Do you export? We are humble people, sir. Go to the local branch of your bank. I referred loans for agricultural development. - Yes, sir? - For a loan... I a have a tannery at Potamia... - Certificate of expediency? - What's that? Fill in this form, come again tomorrow before 10 o'clock. - Will I get it? - It depends. Type of company. Private, go on! GH/P per cubic meter... What's that? It means horse power... Leave it blank. Personnel, workers and office staff. We four and uncle Thymios. Write "five". I am not a worker. I go to school. They won't check it. Go on and write clearly! Main installations and outbuildings. What shit! Why do they need to know? Write! A soak, a drying loft, a shed and a cutting press. We'll get in touch with you. - Will it take much time? - Some. You are not the only one. EVANGELIDES MEMBER OF PARLAMIENT Mr. Evangelides is here? Woman... Are you asleep? Your old tricks again. When did you fall asleep? I asked you something. - What do you want? - To talk. You drink too much. The whole room stinks. Raki is good for you. It kills the pain. I need it now that everything goes wrong. I'll call the priest They cast us the evil eye. I have made many debts. I might loose my factory. If the foundations are strong... It's the soil. - What about the bank? - We'll see. Evangelides? He promised me... He's lying. I'll get the loan before august. He knows that you didn't vote for him. Lycourgos, his secretary, is my personal friend. He'll do it. Did you bribe him? He's my friend. We get drunk together. You get drunk! Your daughter will not pass the exams. Damn her! She is only thinking about men. She told me that she wants to be a film star. She had better find someone to marry. A woman cannot live decently in the village. You have a good life, no? If the factory falls down, we are ruined, you know that? We have no fields, no herds, nothing. I'm the head of the family. I know what to do. If you want to work, come to the factory to carry stones. I'm dead tired. I wish you were dead. Then you wouldn't talk! We'll do it. - The rain will flood it again. - I'll Build a dam, here. - You need an engineer plans. - No. You know everything! Shut up and bring some stones, quickly! You do things you know nothing about. Shut up, will you? Marry a woman, deaf and dumb! Is there a leather factory around here? - Papyro's tannery? - Yes. There it is. He is my husband... He asked for a loan from the local bank. Aris! They are from the bank! Come along! Come along to see it! For the loan. Promise them something... I have to make a report to the bank about the factory. It's that stream which overflows. I was always going to repair it but the time passed... - The site is yours? - Yes. My father wanted me to keep the factory. - Brothers, sisters? - Two married sisters. We divided what our father left us. They took all the fields. - Other property? - Our house. - A small field. - With potatoes. The factory is all we have. If I could buy some machinery... I'd be the best tanner in the whole region. The mixing of colours needs skill. I need some modern machinery. Then I'll sell to Salonika To Athens. I'll be able to make them very thin. - Where do you sell them? - At the village. I give them to shoemakers, upholsterers, quilt-makers. - How many sq.m.? - 880. - They made the road. - They took a part. - We protested. - Nobody listened. - Leathers? - Yes. With the loan, I plan to buy some electrics machines. Do you know that the cutting press costs 2 million drachmas? We are four people and only manage to cut 50 m.a. day. The others have machines. They cut 1.000 m. a day. They have lower prices because they have lower cost. With the machines, I'll lower the cost. You have given me a comprehensive idea for my report. - Shall we get it? - I don't make the decisions. I met the manager. He said he's willing to help. Wait a minute! I'm coming! Leathers, for you. You can make shoes, bags... Excuse me... To remember us by... It's our living... I told you to give him something. He didn't even look at the leathers. Money is different. I have a good mind to throw you into the stream! 5.800 and 7.000 from last week. Give me a little time. They owe me a lot of money. Next time you'll pay in advance. Wait till I get the loan. I'll make a two-storied factory. I'll build a new house, too. We'll see... Valentini, I want to talk to you. Valentini, I love you. They owe me 17.000, some debts are from last year. Materials are going up. Go and ask for the money don't stand there. They have difficulties too. Trade is very bad. You never get anything without threatening. If I threaten them, I'll loose them. They are poor. The big tanneries have capital, they give credit. What can I do? - Morning, Costas. - Morning, Papyros. Could you pay me for the leathers I brought to you? I repair the factory and I need money. I'll see what I can do. Shoes to order don't sell. People prefer ready-made shoes. They are better, too. They make thousands of pairs with their big machines. How to compete with them? I only make 5-6 pairs a month. I owe you 5.000. I'll give you 3.000 now. The rest, next week. I wanted to see you. Your leathers are no good, Papyros. You must try for better quality. I asked for a loan for new machinery. There's the new factory, too. What factory? A big one, near Prohoma. Everything automatic. They'll make exports, too. - Do you know who owns it? - No, a corporation. - Nobody's here. - It isn't working yet. Anybody here? You need capital, nowadays. The bank won't help, dirty bastards! Machines alone don't make leather. It needs skill, experience. Money is everything. What can we do? Things have gone wrong. We should get away as soon as possible. Go where? Don't know. Athens, Salonika. We'll find a place. They won't make me give up, Aris. The factory is my whole life. It was my father's life. They used to come from Crete to buy leathers from us. Those were old times. Now, What? How many workshops are left? One or two in Dramas, another outside Kavalla, in Serres, Salonika, They built a big unit in Serres. There must be others. They'll wipe them out, like they did to us. My father taught me the art. He was a fine craftsman. They want fashionable things. Cheverel. Damn their fashions! The government doesn't help the provinces. Don't talk like that! They won't give us the loan. Do you think they will? Lycourgos promised me that I'll get it for sure. - The bastard. - He's straight. When I was in the army, The transfer... He couldn't do anything. - I won't vote for him. - Don't say it. Vote for Caramanlis, Papandreou even for the communists. But it's not politic to say it. You'll go with whoever is elected. We mustn't go against the authorities. Greeks! Do you still kneel in front of our enemy? Why don't you rise up in arms against the Turks? Better to die for freedom than to live slavery. God is with us, my brave ones! We shall free Greece! Have you gone mad? It's a play for the school festival. The song of freedom is heard all over our country. The plains, the hills, the sea the islands, the rivers, cry out for us to chase the Turks from this holy land. holy land... I follow you, a faithful servant. Wherever I am, you'll be by my side. Where's your mother? Did she see you? She went to the factory with the constable. We're building without a permit. Why didn't you tell me at once? The constable is asking for a permit for the factory! - Where's he? - He left. We need a permit. We are only doing repairs. He knew about the dam. Everything. Someone must have talked. That's why you must be careful what you say! - And he wants a permit. - Or he'll pull it down. I want to build a dam at my tannery. The constable said I need a permit. Do you have plans from the engineer? It's a wall. You need plans, a surveyor's report, Go to an engineer. We need money for all those papers. Evangelidis could help is he was here. For sure... I'll see Vayios. He's a construction worker. - A dam? - A wall, 2x3 m. We build blocks of flats without a single permit. The constable doesn't like me. He did it on purpose. - Why? Are you a communist? - No. He turned against me. You want it quickly. There's so much red tape you'll never finish. It'll cost you much money. He said he'll pull it down. Well, build it at night. It'll be ready in a weekend. They build whole houses during the night. In one or two weekends, they put the roof. Then, none can pull it down. The law protects it. Look, get away! It'll fall on your head! What do you want? - Is it yours? - Yes. Revenue office. Don't you see? It's falling down. Invoices? Nobody comes. It's only us and spiders in here. I want to see your books. See what? It doesn't work anymore! I want to check the previous years. I don't need to have them. I live in a mountain village. Your factory is under our jurisdiction. They haven't been examined for many years. I have stopped production. You should have payed tax on invoices and stamp duties. We are living from hand to mouth. Trade is very bad. The big ones from Athens get everything. - We don't earn... - Shut up! What rent do you pay for the building? No rent, it's mine. But it's falling down. There's a tax on property. I have a family, mister. I still owe the raw materials. I pay interest on the loans, I have protested bills. You'll pay a penalty. I never do anything else. Greeks! Do you still kneel in front of our enemy? Why don't you rise up in arms against the Turks? Better to die for freedom than to live slavery. Valentini, you have won my heart. I loved you from the first time I saw you. I came from Germany to marry you. I love you. You'll live like a queen, Valentini. I'm too young. I lost my sleep from thinking about you. Go away! - I'll ask for your hand. - I don't want to marry. Don't go away! Say something nice to me. - I'm too young to marry. - I love you Valentini. Katina! It's me, Polyxeni! Welcome. Come in. Listen. Manio, the sister of Chrysafis, sends me. Apostolos came from Germany. They want your daughter for him. He saw her, he liked her. He has made a fortune in Germany. Have you seen his car? She's still at school. A woman must marry before her 18th birthday. I married 12 years old. What do you say? I'll talk it over with my husband. How much dowry does he ask? He didn't say. But can you have a marriage for free? We don't have money to spend now. Let her be. She's not an old maid yet. They'll value her more if she finishes the school first. Where did he see her? Where? She's always in the streets. She knows them better than the postman. Where are you going, papa Revmata? We need rain. The soil, the animals, Pay him to say a prayer for the factory. Prayers won't help us. God doesn't listen to prayers. You say these things and then God punishes us all. I have nothing against God. Only against people. The world has turned upside-down. And why? Radioactivity is going to blow us all up. Give me 100 drachmas worth. I'm Papyros, with the tannery in Potamia. What about the loan I asked for? Nothing yet. Will it take long? I can't go on working. We'll let you know, when we have news for you. Lycourgos is not here? He went to Athens. My name is Papyros. I have a tannery. I asked the bank for a loan. He promised to help me. Sit down. - Name? - Papyros. - Do you vote for us? - Always. - How much do you need? - 200.000 I'm thinking of asking for 500.000. I don't see your name. Does Evangelides know you? Lycourgos told him about me. He's my personal friend. What can I say? I want to help. But I don't want to get into trouble. I love our town. I'm not trying to make a profit. I never ask for a commission like others. Some people leave money for charities. That, yes. The state cannot give to the poor everything they need. Leave me your name and everything. I'll see the manager. For the orphans. Ari, a little more water. We'll never finish. I'll get the loan and then I'll start on the 2nd floor. I'll make a store-room with all the samples. The client comes, sees the samples and makes his choice. They're building new factories, but they don't have craftsmen. Quiet! They'll hear you! We are a nation of heroes! The greatness of the heroic Greek people, is glorified through the centuries of history. Churchill said, that the heroes fight like Greeks. I saw Apostolos who wants to marry Valentini. He doesn't care about the dowry. He's in love with her. - What do you say? - I don't know. We should invite him here and talk it over with him. We said that she must go to the university to study. She doesn't need studies, she needs a man to marry her. You know best. - I'll take him as a partner. - Good for him. He has made a lot of money in Germany. He is rich. - She doesn't like him. - Who cares? Wake up! We are ruined! The factory. Aris come quickly to the factory! Remember me? I'm papyros. About that loan. Nothing yet, I'm afraid. I need the money, now. It's been referred to the committee. What news? Business is very bad, Papyros. People buy plastic. Though my bags are first quality. Leather is immortal. They prefer the cheaper plastic ones. How can a craftsman live? There are worse things. Don't you know what happened to me? The factory fell. I'm ruined. How did it happen? The stream flooded it. The foundations were rotten. Nothing remains now. It's a great pity. You are such a good fellow. Who's going to help you now? Nobody. Will you go on? Goodbye. It's a pity but small shops have no future. I opened a supermarket in the village. Nobody goes to the grocer anymore. It was fate. This site is exactly what I'm looking for, Papyros. Tell me how much you want and we'll make a deal now. It is not for sale. I'll tell you what I was thinking. Now that the factory fell down, you'll need money. I'll get a loan and build it again. You know best. I'll buy machines to improve the quality. The grocer wants the money I owe him. It's the first time I've asked him for credit. The man who sold us the cement, I met him today, He'll get his money. The factory is ruined, not I. As long as I live, you have nothing to fear. - Will you sell it? - I'll rebuild it. How? Nothing remains. We'll see better days yet. It's not possible. He wants it for a storeroom, damn him! I'll give you 300.000, this moment! I told you! I want it myself! It's my last offer! I won't ask you again. Why did you refuse? It was a good price. Shame on you! Lost your courage? Trust me. We'll rebuild the factory. The others are organized. We don't have anything. How to compete without capital, machines... We'll find a way. - Where do you live? - Aachen. How do you like it? Some things I like, some others not. There are not many jobs for foreigners. - What do you do? - Industrial worker. Tell him how much you earn. I get 3.000 marks a month. Others get less. - When did you go to Germany? - After the army. What do you plan to do? Come back? Of course! That's why I want to marry a Greek girl. My sisters married Greeks, their children are Greeks. I remember them as little girls. He's alone now, no family obligations. What will you do when you come back? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I've some money. I'll set on my own. He'll be a great man, some day. I had a tannery, Know anything? I do. It's ruined, but I'll rebuild it. I'll get a loan and buy machines. - Some difficulties, now... - Shut up! Many want to put money in it and come in as a partners. I don't agree. The factory belongs to my children. I'll leave it to my children and to my son in law. In the family. I don't want partners. Better alone. Do you agree? Of course. That's a good boy! If I had money, I'd have done it a long time ago. As you love Valentini and want to marry her, I thought that we could do it together. The business will stay in the family. What do you say? I don't know. It's a very easy job. Tomorrow, I'll take you to see it. - Where's Valentini? - Studying. Tell her to come and meet Apostolos. I won't. - Just to meet him. - No. He's old. The husband must be older and wiser. I don't like him, I don't love him. When I married, nobody asked for my opinion. Your father saw me, they agreed on the dowry, My mother said: "Men choose, women submit". I didn't question it for a moment. You won't give me away to him, will you? The wall will come up to here. I'll move the entrance. It's near the road. Water from the stream, no workers, I only pay for the skins, that's all. Think about it and we'll talk it over. I wont marry him. Don't you see how lucky you are, you fool! I won't marry him. For your own good, for the good of your family. He'll come as a partner. I'll rebuild the factory. - I'll be a film star. - I'll kill you! Papyros is finished. Don't give him money. We'll open the service station together. - Damn that girl! - Find another one. I love her. I want her. You have a big heart. Cheers! You shouldn't have shown her how much you like her. Women like to be ordered about. They're fools. From the mind to the womb, we fill them I love her, damn her! She may have a boyfriend. We'd have known it in the village. Why didn't you marry a European girl? Foreigners are trollops. They go with everyone. I thought I should marry immediately. I didn't expect her to refuse. What's wrong with me? Am I a cripple or something? You're a fine boy! There's a way to make her marry you. You'll fuck her and then she'll beg you to marry her. He's right. They won't even ask you for money. They'll give you a big dowry. That’s the best way! I'll have trouble with the cops. No, since you are willing to marry her. We'll open the service station and make a fortune. The variety theater "Astero" has visited our village! At Argyrakis's cafe, two plays with the same ticket. "Our great mother" A heroic play about the war. "Love and Sing", a show with comedy, songs and dance Everyone must come at Argyrakis's cafe at 8 o'clock! You'll see the international star Jenny Fogou. The very beautiful miss Vana Pouliou. The world known TV star, Sultana! The Australian star Thanasis Kralias. And Van Koua, the famous fortune teller. who predicted the divorce of Elizabeth Taylor. He'll tell you your fortune for only 50 drachmas. I'll go to the market to sell last year's potatoes. I can sell it at double the price. You'll stay here, where you belong. The children don't need me. They're old enough. I married you to look after the house not to work. To look after your husband and children. You, magician, tell us our fortune. If you don't want me, I shan't come again. What do you want? I want to be an actress. Come on, grandpa! Come on, boys! What would your young man say if he saw you? - I won't marry him! - We'll see. We'll wait for you at the quarry. I want to talk to you. - Come on, for a moment. - I'll be late at school. I'll take you with the car. Come on! I want to talk to you in private. I'm listening. - I love you. - Is that all? - Why don't you marry me? - I told you. Your father agrees. You are headstrong, that's all. I want to finish the school. Do you know how much money I make? haven't gone to school but I could buy that car. - Where are you going? - I'll marry you. I'll be late. Turn back. Stop! I want to get off! - Where are we going? - For a ride. - I'll open the door. - You'll get killed. I want to get off. - Why did you bring me here? - To talk. I love you. - They'll see them. - So much the better. What are you going to do? I'll go and talk with him. After what happened? I'll see if he is still thinking about marriage. - I won't marry him. - Shut up! If you had listened nothing would have happened. I won't marry that beast. Nobody else will marry you. We should send him to prison. And talk about it at court? - I won't marry him. - He's an animal. The whole village knows about it. They're laughing at us. - We did nothing wrong. - They don't care about it. What shame! Shame on him! Couldn't you look after yourself? Why don't you avenge her honour? I'm not afraid of him. Give Ne the rifle! No, Aris. It will be worse for us. Mary him! Then, everything will be all right. I prefer to die. Think about your family. Our reputation is ruined. How are we going to live? You should have gone to the police. I'll go myself. - What do you say? - No. And the factory? - What news, Philota? - The same. - Did you hear about the factory. - I did, Papyros. That's life. I'm expecting a loan from the bank. Prices are going up. Skins, enamels, chemicals. I know. It's the same with meat. When it reaches the market, it's double the price. I wanted to ask you if you have any pigskins. I've only calves. What do you want them? I can work them at home. Pigskins are much in demand. Panaghiotou must have pigskins. What don't you ask him? I will. It is the only trade I know. I want some sheepskins. They're expensive. I'll buy some pigskins, too. Come and help! I brought sheepskins and pigskins. I bought them on credit but it's a great chance. We can work them here. We'll get a good price for them. There is no market for them. My coloured sheepskins are famous. They're the best. There is no profit in them. Fool... - Did she keep it a secret? - Everybody knows it. Afentoulis was asking for the money you owe him. I'll pay him. - He'll come again later. - I'll pay him. We owe money to the grocer, too. I know. The children need clothes. They are in rags. That's why I don't go to church. The church won't close down. Good luck. - Any news, Papyros? - The same. I heard that you sold your track. I'm going to buy a car. What do you want? It's about the site. I'll give you 20.000 more. Why do you keep it? Better sell it to me. I told you, I'll rebuild the factory. - Won't you change your mind? - It's not for sale. Do you really believe that you'll rebuild it? Why? Don't you believe it? Aris has got a job. Know it? - Where? - Didn't he tell you? At the new factory. At Prohoma. Why don't you go too? It's our last chance, isn't it? - I'm not a worker. - I might go. As long as I live, you shall not go to work. Don't you know what people will say about me if you work? People respect me. That's enough for you. - Is this his house? - Yes, sir. He must be there. I see lights. Mister Papyros! Someone is asking for you. Who is it, at this time? Come in, Mr. Afentoulis. I was just passing. - How is it going? - I was looking for you. The factory fell down, do you know it? You should have come and payed me. I'll come in a few days. I'll see what I can do. The bills are protested, Mr. Papyros. Just a few days more. I need money. I am a tradesman. I have some difficulties. Give me some time, that's all. I'll get a loan from the bank. How much time? - Two weeks. - Impossible! You want to steal the money. Don't shout, Mr. Afentoulis. I'll pay. Quiet! People are sleeping! I'll pay you everything. Ten days, that is all I ask. I don't care! I want my money and I'll take it now! We'll take him to court, tomorrow. He told you that he'll pay you. - I can't wait. - We'll see you in court. Go to court since you don't understand. Even the law will protect me, I know. - You are a swindler! - Blackmailer! I shall go to the police. Go to the Prime Minister, if you want to! - Thief! - Get out of my house! I'll take your house and everything you've got! Damn you, you drink our blood, you're robbing us! Stop him! Get out of my house, damn you! Thief! The whole village heard him. Feed the hens when you come back from school. I'll be late. Papyros! A registered letter from the bank! Father! - Letter from the bank. - The loan! You are requested to visit the local branch of our bank, concerning matters pending at our credit department. It's the loan. That's for sure. Let's go! I told you to trust me. I'd like to see the manager. He's expecting me. Just a minute please. Will you come in? I'll wait for you outside. Sit down. Do you remember me? It's for a loan, for my tannery. Yes, I know. The credit committee, with its decision nº 2346/31, has rejected your application for a loan. Your tannery is not a developing enterprise. Our financial policy doesn't cover support to tanners. Our bank's policy is to give financial support, to enterprises. which fall into the frame of regional development. Tanneries are considered traditional workshops. They never develop into industrial units. You have got a job at Prohoma? Don't be ashamed. I understand you. We haven't started yet. Next week. Are there any jobs open, still? Give my name too.
