We're doing you a favor! With this saddle you wouldn't have been able to get far. We'll hold it for you. Hey, my saddle! Give me my saddle, you dirty rotten pigs! Now, you tell me where they get the idea they can ride this train without paying. Nope. That gets taken by the company for his ticket. Come on, make yourself useful. Join me? - Well? - Where'd you get this? Some bathtub? Hey! Sharpshooter. Easy with those revolvers. We don't want no accidents on this train. My friend saw your show in Tucson, says you're pretty good. That's quite a shot. There's more than one. There's three of them. Did I look at your ticket? How about showing me your ticket? Ha! Ha! Adelante, hombres! Vamos! Anda, anda! Vamos! Hey! Kramer, come on, fast! Billy's waiting. He'll just have to be a little patient. That hijo de perro, he never miss, amigo. That's professional shooting. Ha. We'll never get out with him there. By tonight we must reach the frontera. Don't worry. We'll leave someone behind to put the sheriff on the wrong track. And who will have to stay and die, huh? You! Maybe you're fooling me, huh? Yeah, you. You and your men. Precision shooting. Hey, why do you want to split up with my men, eh? Just to let you and your men get away from here? There's only one who can shoot like that. Tell 'em to stop it. We work very good together, eh? Tell 'em to quit shooting. Nufio, tell the men. Hey, muchachos! [Alto el fuego! Martin? I know it's you, Martin. Come out. It's Billy, Billy Kane. They told me you were looking for me. Well, here's your chance. My men won't shoot. Come out. I'm very pleased to see you in the company of such gentlemen. Kill me, Billy... or, by God, I'll kill you, believe me. I'm afraid you'll lose. Scared, teacher? You better kill me, Billy. But do it quick, for your own good. I guess I'd better. Because only beginners leave witnesses. I never do. Ain't wise. I don't like to have my picture up on walls and have people shoot me in the back to get a reward. What's the matter? You trying to find an excuse to kill me? You know damn well you don't have to shoot me down to stop me from talking. You're afraid. Sooner or later I'll get you. You can get me any day you want to. If you can still hold a gun. We all go together now, eh, Billy? You joke with me before. I said you were staying! You try to follow me and I'll put a bullet in your head. Come on. - Ha! - Ivamos, compafieros!

Your attention, please. I'm about to present the great, the fabulous Ricky Shot! Yes, in person, Ricky Shot! You're all about to see the incredible come true when you see what he does to a target. The very cowboy I saw one day make a coward of Jesse James! The very cowboy who managed to split the cords that were tightly binding his poor aged mother who would die! A moment later from a Navajo... The cowboy who, from a distance of 500 feet, actually shot a hole through a thin dime! That's right, folks! You know, I think that punk can outdraw you. It's a bet. Why, I tell you, there's no one from the Atlantic to the Pacific, I assure you, no one from Mexico to Canada has been able to outdraw the lad I bring you today. I give you the incomparable Ricky Shot! Yeah! You're all about to see the great Ricky Shot shooting a plate in mid-air. Ready? Thank you! Hey, champion! Well, you win. Sure I win! I'll buy us a drink. Come on. Whiskey! These gunfighters are getting fewer and fewer. Swine! You filthy swine! Get up out of there. You're saying that to me? You're a bunch cowards and swine cos you know I can't use a gun. I don't need my gun. I can still smash your face in. Hey, Gary, watch out you don't hurt him! You shouldn't do that. It just ain't nice. - No, not the beans! - Go to hell! I could've managed it alone. Hey, you. This is for the damage and for burying my friend out there. Well, thanks. Adiés. See you. This is the third one that's ended up like this. The minute you say you're a gunfighter there's always someone that has to prove he's faster than you are. But it wasn't like this a few years ago, when I could still shoot a gun. No one had the guts to challenge me. I was the whole show. Now that they've killed your boy, what are you gonna do? Start all over. Too bad. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. It's a waste of time. Now I got to worry about finding myself another boy. You got a strong thumb and your fingers are quick. How much does your work pay? Enough to live on. I'll offer you 30 percent. I want half. It's a deal. By the way, you didn't introduce yourself. What's your name? Ricky. Ricky Shot. Give me a hand. Oh, one more thing. I never did ask you. Are you any good with a pistol? Enough to live on. You wasted the shot. That's not the center. If you don't like loud noises you'll have to pick off that fuse like the stem of a flower. What do you expect out of these old things? You'll never learn if you don't concentrate. Got that? Alright, I'll put it where you can see it. If you miss this time, you'll have to get yourself a new teacher. I keep telling you to stand with your feet further apart, dammit. And put your left foot 12 inches behind the other one. That's right. Your arm's gotta be rigid. Rigid, I said! You gotta feel your blood running from your shoulder right through the tip of your gun. Thumb the same height as the index finger. Line up your sights first, then your target. Fire! Matter of luck. I always said that six-shooters are good for killing chickens and Indians, but for precision shooting you need dueling pistols. Didn't go off. You think I'm really a fool, don't you? Hey, since when are you smoking my cigars? Huh? - Evening, Sheriff. - Howdy. - What are you doing in these parts? - Oh, just touching up some old props. Got anything to eat? I'm afraid there's nothing left but the hot coals. - You got some coffee? - I think so. - Thanks. - Ricky! I see you made a catch. He's one of the prisoners from Belltown. Had quite a time catching him. Able to get all of 'em? Nope, there's another one around. But, in time, we'll get him. That cot-Fee's not much better than dirty water, but it's all we got. At least it's hot. How's business? Haven't got our new tricks ready yet. No one is willing to give us credit. I've had it rough, too. It's been days since I've slept in a real bed cos we've been looking for that fourth convict. But he won't get far without a horse. Say, Martin, you see a lot of people traveling around. Information like that pays good. If you see any of these faces, come and tell me. In Belltown. We'd better be going now. Good night, sheriff. Be seeing you. So... you're the fourth convict. - What if I was? - You know, I wouldn't mind getting my hands on that reward. Calm down. To me... you're just Ricky Shot. Grab it. Shoot at that. Alright, you can get down! I'm looking for Vigonza. Hey, Martin. Come over this way. He's in here. Hey! Buenos dias, amigo. I heard they killed another one of your boys. Ah. Those are bad people. I've been seeing a lot of these around in the last few weeks. That can only mean that Billy Kane and his gang are on their way again toward Texas. You wanna talk about it? Come in. Hey, artista! Show me how good you are. Who's Billy Kane? He's the one who put the holes in the hands of your boss. That's something you should know. Why you think he teach you to shoot, huh? He must have two steady hands on the day when Billy Kane comes home again. Hey, artista. Show me how you shoot. If I don't have no audience I don't feel like it. You won't have one when you have to challenge Billy Kane. You'll die on that clay, but all alone. Because no one, not even you, can outdraw Billy Kane. Ah, this is a very poor country. Si, sefior, muy pobre. It makes life difficult for us bandidos. , - Tortilla! The people don't eat enough. And our friend Billy Kane, he knows there's not enough for both of us. So I must get rid of him first before he gets rid of me. Who's gonna do it, Vigonza? Who's gonna be the man to face Billy Kane? You? Now who's kidding who? Listen, you're nothing. Only Ricky is quick enough to take Billy Kane. We wouldn't like it if your boy is killed first. It is very difficult to stay alive around here if you're a pistolero. Why don't you make a deal with us, Vigonza? Just give me a small advance. It's sort of an investment, that's all. To guarantee the funeral of Billy Kane. Well? Only a few dollars. How about it? Come on, Vigonza. No! You stupid old fool. Don't you understand? I don't need your help. Things are different now. [Yo soy un hombre importante, muy importante! Ah. I have a big band, muchas women, money. El dinero is power. As soon as Billy Kane has his foot in my territorio, I Will find him. I will know where and when. Subieras! Give him a sack of flour and get him out of here. Here we don't give nothing for nothing. Come here and see if you can win it. If you can put this card on top without knocking down the others, then we'll give you a keg of gunpowder, too. These hands of mine? You said you was hungry, no? You are not lucky, old man. We'll see. Come on, we're leaving. - Didn't you get what you were after? - I said we're leaving! We're gonna have to sell these two pistols. They won't fetch more than two bucks. Enough to feed us for a while. Did you expect I was gonna let you learn to shoot on an empty stomach, son? I don't care about me, but I wanna keep your belly full. Go on. Hey! Hey! The only lotion in the world that put hair back on the heads of people scalped by that fierce Indian Sitting Bull. No more baldness! Why, it even cures other ailments from flaking scalp... Now, don't you try to get out of it. It's useless. You said that sharpshooter's no good, but I want to see him all the same. - Come on. - Alright, let's take a look at him. Attention, attention! People, please! Attention! You will see a sensational act that's sure to go down in the pages of folklore. You will tell your grandchildren what you've seen on this great day here in this great city. The one and only, the great Ricky Shot! Alright, Mister Champion! Yay! I've seen guys who could shoot that rope in half in Cheyenne. Now, before your eyes you're going to witness an act presented to people all over in every country from here to Persia. The sensational Ricky Shot, champion sharpshooter! One, two, three. Great! What did you say you saw in Cheyenne? I hope you enjoyed yourselves, folks. Isn't he great? Thanks. We appreciate that, ma'am. Thanks. Thanks. Now, ladies and gentlemen, your attention. Please, absolute silence now. The champion is ready for the wheel of chance. Let her spin! Brilliant! Four aces with exactly four shots. The wheel of fortune stops. Ace of diamonds, ace of clubs, ace of hearts and ace of spades. What have we got here? Everyone a bull's-eye, as you can see for yourselves. Thank you, and now Ricky Shot thanks you for the kind applause and will perform for you his last, most stupendous number. Those shots were way low. You still got a lot to learn. How'd the collection go? About enough to get us through the next two weeks. Go on, get it over with. Hello, Martin. You're looking fine. Haven't changed a bit. What do you want? You're gonna take me to Vigonza, so I can sell him Billy Kane. Get out of here, Kramer! I can't manage it alone. Ever since Billy discovered that I ran out on him, he's been right on my heels. Three days he's been on my trail. I tell you, I've had it. Your friends just don't want to part with you. Take me to Vigonza. He'll pay us well. - But hurry up! - Get out of here. Take me to Vigonza, you no-good son of a... Let me introduce Ricky. He can hit a dime in the air at 50 paces. So get out fast and don't come back! I say we should've put those holes in your head instead of messing up them hands. - One of Billy Kane's men? - Yeah. He was one of the bandits that held up the train, wasn't he? What about it? Anyway, what do you care? What the hell are you doing? I'm taking my 50 percent. Wait a minute! Hey, what are you planning? I'll see you later. I wanna get drunk. This place is like a morgue. Come on, I'm paying for everybody. Let's liven it up. Hey, Charlie, I want a drink. So, you found me, Billy, eh? It's about time, isn't it? But now that I see you, I feel better. Maybe you'll let me finish this first. - I'll take it. - Alright. Thanks. Come on, dance! "M Paving, aren't |?" Here. You want some? Go on, drink! Go on, drink I said. Go ahead, girls. Go on, keep on dancing! Dance! I said dance! Fancy seeing you here, champion! If you came here to get me, it's too late. Because I had a little run-in with Billy. Where'd he go? Who the hell cares where that son of a snake's gone? He always turns up at the right moment. Hey, gimme! Dance, go on! Hurry up and die, will you? And don't stop until I tell you. Everything's free tonight. Go on, dance! Hey, you, you gotta tell Vigonza Billy's returned alone. Tell him Billy's men aren't gonna get here till Friday. All of them are planning to go to Tehuantepec. His men are sick and tired of him and they're ready to sell his hide. Vigonza ought to know that all of Billy's men are ready to hand him over on a silver platter! He'll pay you good. Uh-uh. Ah, no. "Sardanapalus". Who is this Sardanapalus? Huh? An old king. "The Death of Sardanapalus". What do they mean, going off and killing all of them women? They say he wanted them murdered because he didn't want to die alone. You know? And he had the right idea. Come here, blondie. Come here, will you? Don't worry, you other girls will get your chance. Me too, if I'm going to hell, I want some company. No, Kramer! Shoot me, you dog! Hey, Martin. Martin, show me how to use this. You're learning to shoot a dueling pistol. What do you want with a six-shooter? To get the men who robbed the train. So that's what was really on your mind. To use me. They're the only ones who can give testimony, and you're hoping I'll lead you to them. You're no better than I am. You want to use me to kill Billy Kane. Tehuantepec's the place where you'll find him. Get that out of your head. You're not ready for Billy Kane yet. He'd put all six shots in you. Quit drumming up trade! You're not doing the show. I still could have clone it without you! Always fire two shots. Because if you wait between shots, you might find yourself dead. Shooting at a target isn't like shooting at a man. It's being quick that counts, not how precise your aim is. And forget them fancy tricks. Just put your thumb on the hammer. And then ease it back slow while you draw. See? You're ready to aim and shoot in one motion. Fire! Always pick this point when you shoot. Otherwise you're wasting bullets. Not bad. But don't get any big ideas. You'll have to do better than that to get Billy Kane. Look what he did to that holster, will you? It seems like it was cut with a razor. That's about the greatest shot I've seen in my time. Why didn't he kill you on the train along with everybody else? Were you friends? I heard of him. Look at that closely. You can't do better than that. And you still want to go to Tehuantepec? Yeah. Trouble. IVamos, hombre! Ezequiel, ¢Qué hacemos con estos? Make them get down and go and unhitch their horses. IBaien! Aqui esté escrito que es un gran tirador. GUn tirador? iAy, ay, ay! [Mira cémo mato el tirador! Ezequiel, you're next! No, no, no! Leave me alone! Well, you're getting there. That was luck. I'll mind the ladies. - Don't catch cold, ma'am. - Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. - You girls alright? - Richard Martin! Hey, Betty Starr! What are you doing here? Me and my girls was on tour. I guess that we're the only ones that escaped. If you want me to, I'll take you to Tehuantepec. One place is as good as another. Let's get going. Ricky! You know each other? Where did you two meet? I'm always getting into debt with Ricky, ain't I? Billy Kane's men have arrived. - You took a long time to get here. - Hey, Vigonza! GCémo estés? You look more like a gringo every day. How did it go? How about the others? We split up into groups when we left Arizona, but all of us are meeting here tonight. Ah, bueno, good! - It wasn't easy. - Hola, 4' Que' tal? Now Billy's got us in trouble with the Federals. Billy Kane? Billy Kane ask much and don't give nothing. He is loco. Yeah, he likes blood, but he don't like money. Now we eat, amigos. Sit down, sit down. Hey, you! Bring out the food! IDe prisa! He is the owner of the house, but I picked his place because it is close to Tehauantepec. Quickly! The food's for my amigos. And pick up the cup you dropped. Eat my friends, eat. ICégelo! Bueno, Billy is expecting us at the saloon after sundown. Instead of us, he's gonna find you. I kill him? You mean me and my muchachos? Yeah. We're going to stay right here. Maybe you'll kill him and maybe you won't. Billy is bound to shoot up a few people. Well, it ain't going to be us. It's the quietest place on the whole border. It was built by Quakers. Ever since they built the railroad, there's been quite a bit of money in circulation. This town hasn't changed a bit. Thank you. Thanks, Martin. Our pleasure. Everybody out, girls. Well, it's about time. - You like it? - It's marvelous. Careful there, honey. - This is where you'll stay. - Thank you. Disculpe, sefior. You said this was a peaceful place. Yes, it is, in Texas, but Mexico is on that side. This is the borderline, right here in the middle. - Welcome back, Betty. - Thank you. Tequila or whiskey? Disculpa, sefior. iDiscUlpame! Betty Starr, Velvet Legs! Come here, all of you! Come here, hombres, and look who has arrived! Go and get them! You too! Ivamos, vamos! Ricky, I owe you something. I'll be here. You are new here, s1'? Can I buy a drink, sefiorita? Vigonza has respectfully requested our presence. It seems that Billy Kane's men have arrived. You, no. Find out what these filthy pigs want. Don't worry, I'll wait for you at Eagle Rock. Hey, amigo! You didn't bring me the message of Kramer. The last words of a dying man are sacred. He killed three of our men, Vigonza. You want money? Sure. Why not? "Ha!" V'9Onza! What about him? Let me go, huh? - He wants to leave us. - Ah, he can go. Gracias, sefior. Muchas gracias, sefior. What if he talks? Here's much money for you. You get this from me if you kill Billy Kane. Go on. When he turns his back, then you will be able to give us a signal. We will all shoot him before he has the time to shoot us. This is our signal. Huh? Come on, play something light and gay. Ricky, you don't want to drink that stuff, do you? This is what we keep for the special customers. It's gonna be a bad night. I can smell it. Vigonza. Be careful, it may mean trouble for you. We're ready. Hey, all of you! Get out of here. Go on, hurry. You too. Move everybody out of here. Get ready, quickly. IVamos, répido! - You better get out. - Ricky, don't do anything foolish! I said get out! IMadre de Dios! Play! Whiskey, madam. You Billy Kane? What's it to you? They gave me this money. To kill you. That's mighty funny. Your men have sold you out to Vigonza. And he's put you here as bait, I suppose. There are six of them in here. When I light a match... they'll shoot you. There's one sitting by the table. The rest are sitting in there. Vigonza's hiding behind the piano. I can see the tip of his boot. Which end of the keyboard? Where the high notes are. Can you get one of them? Two: The one at the table and the one with the poncho. NOW! There's one you missed. Let's have some music. What do you want from me? You can help me get back to my ranch. I was on that train for Tucson you held up. But since I hadn't any ticket, they threw me off. Then they found my knife in the belly of the train conductor. The judge gave me thirty years. How did you get out? Some of the jailbirds made a break and I went along. I'm wanted dead or alive. All I need is one of your men that can swear I didn't rob that train. It's the only way I know to prove that I'm not guilty. And you want me. Never even thought of it. One of your men'|| do. It's a deal. He's going to warn the others. Martin! I guess you saw what happened. Yeah, I saw it. It doesn't matter. You're disappointed, aren't you? I counted on him to get Billy Kane for me. I thought he was gonna do it, too. But he had his own reasons to act the way he did. Yeah. Well? Is he dead? Take your choice. You want Clem? Clem likes to talk. Keep you company on your trip. Or take Doc here. He could bandage a wound or pull your tooth if it hurts. What about Dirty here? He's got a strong smell, but he wouldn't harm a flea. I guess that's why you got so many flea bites, ain't it, Dirty? You can have Bastard Sam, too. They wanted to lynch him cos he shacked up with a ten-year-old girl. It wasn't my fault. I thought she was twelve. One of you is going with my friend here to the sheriff. Maybe you'll get hung, but it's something I owe him. Which one do you want? It makes no difference, just as long as he talks. If he won't talk for you, he won't talk anymore. I'll make the choice. We couldn't go on anymore like we was, Billy. You were taking... taking half of everything! They ask you to be spokesman? - You, Doc? - Not me, Billy. - I didn't want to sell out, they did! - Get in the corner! Pretty boy. Too busy thinking of women. Hurry UP! You, get over there! You tried to sell me out, but you lost. No hard feelings. The one that draws the lowest card goes with him. Here's your man. Now we're even, right? Get the horses ready. We're going into town. What are you thinking of doing? You said you wanted more money. Well, we're getting it. Before sun-up. And in Tehuantepec. Was that you shooting? Yeah, a coyote. This is Nufio. I know him. Martin, I better tell you something. I was on that train, too. So I've been told. When are you planning on going? At dawn. As soon as I've turned him in to the sheriff, I'm going back to my folks' ranch. Martin, why don't you come with me? I don't fit into bedroom slippers. I've tried 'em. I'll stick to my old boots. You've been a good teacher. A good teacher doesn't teach you how to kill a man. You could've been killed tonight. It never crossed my mind to face him. It's a private fight between the two of you. See you tomorrow. No, Ricky. I guess we'd better just forget about it. Ready? Here! Martin! Hey, Martin! Hey, sheriff, you recognize him? He's waiting for you outside. Billy, we're ready! Here I am, Billy Kane! Those good old days were long ago, Martin. You can't even see, much less hold a gun. Load your gun. Go ahead. They're behind the windows. Don't worry, they haven't got the guts to fire at us. There's always some hothead wherever you go. - Is it bad? - No, no. Guess that's the end of the heroes. Give me the key, grandpa. That's right. Get a move on, you two! He finally caught up with Billy Kane. Why did he have to do it? Every time Billy shot somebody, it was like he was pulling the trigger instead. "Top 9H"- "Richard Martin." "Billy Kane." "Shooting competition." "Dallas county fair, 1876." They won it when they were giving shows together. They were really something. Then Billy got the idea he could do better robbing trains and banks, so he left him. Guess they were pretty good friends. They were almost brothers. Martin taught him everything about shooting. For him, it was his duty to go off and... and put an end to him. Forget about it, Ricky, or I'll have lost you both! Hey, wait. Don't go yet. I saw them go into the saloon. Billy! Billy Kane! I killed the gringo! I'm alone! It's Nufio. Call him again. This time make it more convincing. Let me go. He will kill me. Billy Kane! I'm wounded! Where are you? Help me, you dog! Ha! Well, what do you know. He must have given him the slip, eh? Quiet, you fool. Billy! Come and help me! This young friend of mine laid a trap for me. What does he want? - Me. - Help me, Billy! He's finally in business for himself. I'm wounded, Billy! Where are you? Billy! Help me, I'm wounded! That hijo de puta made me, I had to. Where'd he go? I could not warn you. He made me. Where is he? Somewhere! Billy, I think you too are a hijo de puta. Hey, Preston! You're not too smart! You should have gone, while the going was good. Hey, Ricky! It's too bad. No one to prove your innocence. You shouldn't have come back. But fellas like you wanna die, wanna be a hero. Alright. When the bucket is empty, we'll both come out shooting. What's wrong? Think I'd believe you'd stick by your word? You really want to get killed, don't you? Alright, I'll fix you up. Ha! You think I can't get rid of you whenever I want? Do you hear me? Did you ever see anybody get rid of the king as clean as that? Without touching the other pieces? I was Martin's pupil, too. I know all his tricks. He taught 'em to me to kill you, Billy Kane. Just to kill you, Billy Kane. Bye, Betty. Ricky, what are you gonna do if you have to always run away? What else can I do? I lost all my witnesses. What's your real name, Ricky? Philip Raymond. No, Philip Raymond was killed with the others. I'm gonna tell the sheriff that a stranger killed him, a man called Ricky Shot. Good bye, Betty. Bye, Ricky Shot.
