Marcello, what's wrong? There's a house over there. See it now? It's always been there. Hey! Where are you going? Here. Are you going to Mum! I can't hear you. - I have to pee. - Then go. Are you done? I have to poo. Let's see. Go to bed. I can't concentrate. What's going on? Mum, go to bed, Marinella has to poo. It's true, right? - What? - Let me by. Want to get in bed with me, sweetie? Why did you say you needed the bathroom? You can both come! - Mum, I'm starving to death. - I know... I'm hungry! Angelica, I think we need a door here. - Mummy, let's make cr√©pes! - Now? - I want to! - Don't you have to poo? Be quiet. Is that all! Good girl, now back to bed. All of you, go to bed, we have to gel up early. What's the matter! What's going on? Nothing, Dad. Don't watch it. Turn it off. - The hunters, did they shoot? - No, let's go. The bucket has to be changed. I know. THE WONDERS Fucking hunters! Shoot your peckers off! Knock it off! Enough, already! Fuck you! Where are you all? Gelsomina, let's go! Marinella? We've been waiting for two hours. Let's go. - I didn't hear you. - Yeah, sure. You have to take the little ones. No, I'm busy. I can't waste time. - I'm doing the tomatoes. - Ask Coco to help. It's not a holiday. If she wants to stay, she works, right? Coco! Move your arse, if you want to stay with us! Take them with you, please. You have to start taking them. Hold on tight. Change the bucket! Smoke, Gelsomina. - Dad? - What is it? My mask has a hole in it. The bees will sling me. Get in the car, Marinella, don't be a pain. Poor thing, they'll sting her! It's not true. There's no hole in her mask. We're better alone, aren't we, you and me? Smoke! There aren't very many. They swarmed off, damn it. Where did they go! That way! No... Are you ready? OK! Move the box this way. To the right. Here we go. Careful! Higher, Dad! Like that! Marinella! What are you doing? - Look! Blackberries! - What? - Blackberries. - Let's go. They won't let us in. - What? - They won't let us in. Open up. - We won't let you in! - Open up! - No! - Yes. Open up, damn it all! - No! - Open up! Gelsomina, come here. Take my stingers out. Go away! OK... Come in, Gelsomina! Jump in! No, I'll just wet my feet. Gelsomina! Come on in, come on! - I'll kill you. - I'll smash you into pieces. Hey, excuse me. Could you ask them to make less of a racket, please! Could they keep the noise down? I don't understand. Excuse me! Could you all be quieter! - What do you want? - Maybe you should move down there. Go away! My daughters are free. No, really, please... But tell me why? Now, be quiet and still. Stay right there. It's OK now, it was them. Take your places... Go, Igor. Silence, please. Move away from the rock. Milly, move away from the rock. Slowly... Come forward like that... "Why am I here?" Why am I here? It was a secret, but now it can be revealed. Our great return. "Countryside Wonders" will be here, among the riches of the Etruscan region. Among the families who live like they did in prehistoric times... - Stop! - It's not prehistoric times! I know! Among the families who still live here as they did once upon a time. We'll have a long, splendid evening in the mysterious necropolis at the centre of the lake. And in this twilight between life and death, we'll talk about sausage, ham, cheese and many other delicacies! This hat is heavy! Should we do another take? Little ones, come on. Wolfgang! When will you get a boy! - Soon. - Well, we'll see! Gelsomina, call them. Gem. Came on! Luna, Cate, out. Out! What little fairies... Come here! They're so cute! What are your names? - What are your names again? - Caterina. - Marinella. - Gelsomina. Luna. Ma'am, you're beautiful. Your hair is like sea foam. Thank you. Igor. Igor, where are you? Take these. - Thank you. - Thank you. This is for you. - Bye! - Bye! Get rid of that thing. I don't believe it. It's a load of crap. Got nothing in your head! Help me. - How many beehives are there? - 42. We'll extract the honey right away, OK? - OK? - Yes. - Coco! - We're very busy, Wolfgang! I thought... If we work well and hard, if you work hard, we'll get ourselves a gift. What? We'll buy, for example... a camel. - What did Dad say? A camel? - Yes! You used to like them, didn't you? Yes, when I was little. But it's against the law. Against the law? Who's gonna find out here? Drink, it's good for you. Drink. Drink. - Luisa, see this? - Yes. Yes, I'm talking to you. If you have a family farm, if you produce local products, you can take part in the competition "Countryside Wonders". We'll select just seven families. The one that represents our traditional values best will receive a bag of money and will win a cruise... What's the matter! Nothing. - Are you watching? - Nice! They came to the town hall. I showed them the necropolis so they could film in there. The mayor was so glad when he saw the TV people. "Now you'll see the tourists... " - Want another snack? - No, Mum! Do you? - No, thank you. - Are you being shy? - No. - Yes, you are! - You want another snack? - No. Look at me! Gelsomina! Come here! Come on! Good girls! - You're not on holiday! - Yes, we are. Come and help us. Why are you hanging around here! Go away! Aye you guys angry! It's not a good time. Some bad news. Gelsomina, will you get me something? The peels are stuck. A toothpick works best. They want us out, I'm sure of it. OK, but there must be a solution. I say we think it over. We'll find another place. - Will this work? - Yes, thanks. - Dad? - What is it? - Can we take part? - In what? The "Countryside Wonders". We don't need that crap! - Dad, trust us! Mum... - Your mother thinks like I do. - I don't even know what you mean. - Nothing. I'll tell you. It's a TV programme, you go to the island, and if you're selected, you go and present your products. Look. It seems like a nice thing. Why are you always against everything? - Mum... - Sweetie, wait. - Does it cost anything! - No, but you can win lots of money. That's enough, for fuck's sake! Who needs lots of money? It won't do us any good! - Mum? - What? When I'm 60, will you be dead? Yes. Come on, peel the tomatoes. Lots of money, maybe not, but some would be useful. - You have to side with me. - I'm getting a bit tired. Right, now she's tired! When I'm 60, how old will Gelsomina be? 64, why? It's not fair, she'll be with you four years longer. Marinella, Gelsomina was born four years earlier, it's natural. Look, I'll leave and you'll catch up. Mama, We'll both leave. - What the fuck does that mean? - "Fuck" isn't a mandatory suffix. Just do your job, you. I'm not scared of you, Wolfgang. I was just thinking what the future holds for your daughter. She asked you something nice. She didn't ask to go to a disco, but to take part in a competition for farmers of frigging wonders! And you? Nothing! Nothing at all from you, Wolfgang! What do you think? That she wants to be a farmer? - Why not? - Want to build a wall around her! A high wall? Is that what you want? Let's see... "...hygiene regulations for food services," "for consumer safely." - Go to the important part. - OK. "Commercial honey production," "laboratories having a general surface division..." It's not clear! It means this space should be divided in four parts... "Two for the extraction of the honey from the hives," "with washable, disinfectable white walls," "up to two metres high." "Light coloured flooring," "inclined towards a drainage trap." What's that mean? There should be a hole that we don't have. "For businesses not complying with regulations by November 21," "workspaces will be seized and activities blocked." That's enough! - Thanks. - Mum! Girls, come here. You need a slave, Wolfgang, not four daughters like them. Don't eat them, pick them! - What? - Come on, get picking! Gelsomina, will you help us, please? Why so sluggish? Come and help us! Bring me that thing. What a long face! Hurry up, it's about to rain. Hello. - Ah, is this your wife? - Yes, here's my wife. A pleasure. llde, from Germany, with the project "New Life". As you know, we've finally decided to come... - She doesn't know. - So, this is Marlin. You should've told me. You're not alone in the world, you know! Don't exaggerate. I forgot. Everything can't always be simple. Mum?! I'm fine, honey, go. What do you mean? I mean... if I'd known earlier, I'd have got organised. OK, let's go, they'll be worried. - No. - Make some coffee. I don't think it's a good idea. We keep him until winter, and we'll be OK. Did you see him? He's a child! Did you see his muscles? He's strong, he'll help me. He's dangerous. For the girls! Oh, no? - The police are here. - Forget about the police. - Who's dangerous, Mum? - No one, honey. Let's go. Never let him out of your sight, never! If anything happens, call the Carabinieri. They work with us. It's in his interest to work with us. If re-education doesn't work, he'll do two years in a reformatory. He's got quite a record. He's 14 and got into a little trouble. - But nothing serious. - What did he do? - What did he do? - The typical start of a criminal career. Petty theft, arson... They'd send him first because he's little and agile. He stole some... How do you say? - Almost nothing. - Nothing, no... She said "criminal career". What did he do? Can you tell my wife how it works with the money? The money... My role is only to educate. I don't talk about money. When we see the first report from you, you get the money. Who's the head of the family! - All of us together, why? - No, it's her. - It's Gelsomina! - Coco, don't exaggerate. - It's true! - Over there! Not all together! Head of the family! I want to know, miss, what the arguments are like in the family. Is there a lot of violence? Hitting? Shouting? - Not very much. - Nothing! Because violence is absolutely forbidden. We suggest you use the "method" with these boys. What's this "method"? Shut up once in a while! I have to understand too, Wolfgang! How can you understand if you never shut up? You must never express yourself like that. So... A lot of work is waiting, but Gelsomina will explain it. We want to reorganise the lab and get more bees. Are you scared of bees? Have you ever been slung! Don't you remember! So, you don't remember... Does he understand? - Fuck, good for you! - Don't say "fuck"! - How does he do it! - He practised. - Can you do it? - No. Try. How do you whistle? They want to know how to whistle. - Dad, can you whistle! - No. Kid, you're really good. No, never do that! You must never do that. May I. Sure, come in. He's handsome. Not really. - Do it. - Now? Swear you're not afraid it's not a fraud Tell me, my love A love with a silencer shoots at your head... Boom! You fall down I belong to you, and my promises I keep You belong to rue, and your promises you keep I promise, you promise I swear my love, eternal love And if it's not, in hell I'll rot Men winter comes to tire This love will be a fire I cry in the evening's dark When desperation's in my heart I won't awaken all alone H you're not there, promise Hey, you! Marinella, empty the bucket. - I can't do it. - Come on! What did you do? Get some paper towels! Are you crazy? Dad, it's just a little! A drop. - You have to be careful! - I didn't do it on purpose. You had her do it? How can she! Ask him, that's why he's here! Martin, come here! Come! - Take the bucket there. - Yes. Good boy! Women! Calmly. They feel it when you're nervous. Come on. Wait, Gelsomina, let him open it. Quickly, come closer. Take this off. Good boy! See how nice it is? - Dad, there's too few of them! - What, too few? The plague! It's not the plague. It's poison. Poison? - Go in. - Hello! Hello! - Where's your brother? - In there. - Good evening. - Look who's here! Got a new worker? No, he's German. - I have to talk to you. - Me too. The folks from the selection for that TV programme came. They wandered around here, tasted some stuff. They liked it, but that's not all they liked. - What? - They liked my grandmother. Grandma, they say you're pretty, you're telegenic! You're making fun of me... No! Listen, I don't have time to waste. What did you put on the fields? - How should I know! - Did you use some new product? This again! - Yes? Hey, go get a bottle of weedkiller from the barn. I'm doing tomatoes, I can't. OK, I'll go. My God... Such pain! Death is bad, death is bad, and I was born too early. Here, this is it. You're an idiot! If you say so, then I believe it. You mustn't use this, it's lethal. - Lethal, hear me! - Calm down! The Farmers' Association gives it to us, that means we can use it. These guys are killing you. They're turning you into idiots! He's right, and you know it! It's a trick, Nathalie. They get rich tourists to come who buy everything. - They take over. - Then send us away. - It's true. - What? Shut up. No, he's right! We have to slick together. - Together. - Together we can do something. Because it won't last. Then I want to see the folks who can't even plant lettuce. How can they survive? - Pizzas aren't planted. - They sure aren't. They can't be planted. What will they do when money's no good any more? No good? We could use some, even right now! You know him well. You're mistrustful. Nothing's moved for years here. Maybe we can create some jobs, a little tourism. We have work, wonderful jobs! - Right? - Where? Yes! We need stones! Martin, bring a stone! Is this OK? Yes. Get up on the beehives. Martin, come here. It'll stop soon. Dad? - Dad? - What is it? Lets participate in that thing! It'll be over in five minutes. Did you get stung? Luna, Caterina! Again! Look. When he's not here, we can breathe. Right? Yes. Let's push! Little ones, push. Keep hanging on. Let's go to the island! Harder! How come you know the way? Have you been here before, Gelsomina? Yes. They do the TV thing here! It's fantastic! How can they bring the whole stage, all the material? I've never been here before. - I think he likes it here. - Yes. Where are you going! Come here, let me see that eye. - Listen, Gelsomina... - Mum! Mum! Coming? - What is it? - I want to show you something. What are you doing? Go to bed. If he turns around, do we say hello? Where are you all? Gelsomina, let's go! - We came to rescue you, didn't we? - Yes. Give me a price. - Did you see all the bees? - Yes. So, give me an honest price. Come, Martin. Look. Come on! Yes. Gelsomina! Why isn't she coming? - She doesn't hear me. - Gelso! - Come on, take my stingers out. - Where? I said Gelsomina, she sees better. Why, aren't my eyes good? They hurt! You get out too. - Aren't we doing the swarms? - Get out! I have to explain it to him! Mam, came up Like it? They gave it to you? Yes, there was pink and purple too, but which one is prettiest? - This one. - Thank you. Coming with us? I can't, I have to stay here. Come on! Oh, well. - Bye. I'll be back later. - Bye. Would you give me some honey! Which one? This one, how much is it? Five. - Has it gone up? - No. Gelso, go on! - Here! - Thanks. Go look around. - Gioia? - No idea. She's not here. Can I register? Yes, the form is right there. Give her the pen. "COUNTRYSIDE WONDERS" REGISTRATION FORM Gelsomina? Gelsomina, it's me! Adrian! What a surprise! Fucking hunters. Lun...i? Luna. Luna. She's Luna, and she's Caterina. Yes. My friend, another two girls! Can't you make a boy? Would you like one too! A bracelet with your name. No! And you, Coco, want one? A bracelet with your name? - Coco, Coco, come here. - Leave me alone! Wolfgang, if you don't kick him out, I will, even if it's not my house! You used to like me! "Come, Adrian, come!" you'd say. That's enough cleaning, Angelica. Come here. Let us finish, Adrian. Marinella, why don't you help? I have a headache, it's terrible. - Mum? - Let's go to bed. - No! - Yes, you're all tired. - Good night. - Good night. What organisation! You've really changed. - Why? - Well, you're not like before. Nothing about our struggle, you're all here cleaning, producing... When we lived together, it was different, right, Coco? What are you saying? It's all a mess here! If we don't obey the rules, they'll kick us out. The 21 st of November. No, they just want to scare us. No way, Wolfgang. They're serious. It's good for us they're all involved with these shit Etruscans! Everyone's asking where the Etruscans come from. Why doesn't anyone ask where the Milanese are from? The Milanese! Hey, Angelica, how about going to Milan! What? I'm fine right here. And you, Coco? Leave me alone. And you, Gelsomina? Milan? - Yes. - Yes! Really? Careful, this daughter will betray you. - I know... - It's fine, Adrian. Without her, I'd... I remember you as a child. You always had to be last for the good night kiss, and you, only with him... "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!" You've become a woman. Shut up, idiot, she's still a child. Fuck, Adrian! Go. Who are you! - He's... - He's a great whistler. - Really! - Well... Let me hear you. Whistle! - Whistle! - Is he deaf or what? Yes, if we had more time it would be better. We don't, but we have Coco's money, the boy's money... He helps you though, right? Not too much. I don't know what to do with him. I don't trust him any more, he's changed. - You see enemies everywhere. - No! Yes, you do. You know, we could sell the sheep. - Are you listening? - Yes. Mum?! Sweetheart! I have to tell you something I did. I have to tell you something I did. Tell me. You came to check? Look, there's no one! Is it an excuse! Sweetie, what is it? Nothing. It's not filled out. This is important. You can't collect the money if the documents aren't complete. "Technical abilities and learning skills." - Good. - You said he couldn't do anything. He learned. "Engagement." "Engagement." - Good. - Sufficient. There were some problems, he didn't listen, but... OK. We'll finish it in the car. Coco, will you take re of the food? Take yesterday's leftovers. Coco, will you take re of the food? Take yesterday's leftovers. When I get back, all the honey has to be extracted. We'll be back tonight. Gelsomina! It's our song! Come on! Come on! Stop it! Put the frames in. What are you doing? Nothing! Mum! Mum! It's nothing! Don't get upset! The bucket, did you change it? The bucket? And you? And you? Did you change the bucket? Marinella... Marinella... Marinella... Not here, please. We have to know how the girl got hurt. She says it was with work equipment. Yes... They were playing. We live in the country, you know... They were playing. We live in the country, you know... A tetanus shot is important Has she had a tetanus shot! Coco, the bucket! We didn't change it. Go, quickly! Oh, no! Gelsomina, Dad will kill us! - Understand? - Yeah, he'll kill us, you know? Marinella, get the big brush. Kids, we have to dean up. Come on! Luna, don't play! We have to clean it all up. Gelsomina? - Gelsomina? - What? - A man's here. - A man? - You go! - I'll go. - You go! - I'll go. Who's this man? The one from "Countryside Wonders". Gelso, how do we make coffee! Gelso, how do we make coffee! Don't worry, I don't drink coffee. Thank you. Look at his eyes. May I introduce Gelsomina, the beekeeper of this family business. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. May I talk to an owner? You can talk to us, we work here. I have to inspect the place where you make the honey, the laboratory. For us at "Countryside Wonders", it's fundamentally important to verify the actual production of the firm at the present time, that is, now. Above all, if you're selected, I have to see the laboratory. I have to see the laboratory. Of course. But first, you can taste something. No, don't bother! No, it's very important. - Ma'am, please don't open... - Miss! Sorry. - Lots of vitamins in here. - What is it? It's all up to code here, right? Yes, we're having some work done. The washable walls and the channeling. - May I? - Of course. You're here! I'm leaving him! I've had enough. He spent all the money. What happened? Girls, if I leave him, it's for your good too. Girls, if I leave him, it's for your good too. Calm down! - We have a surprise. - What surprise? With all we have to put in order, the back rent, the debts, the lab! I tried, but with him it's impossible. I tried, but with him it's impossible. Darling, what did you do? What did you do? Where's Gelsomina? Where are my princesses? Where's Gelsomina? Where's Gelsomina? - Gelsomina! - Dad, we have a surprise! Me too, I have a gift. Know what the gift is? I'm leaving you. You're wearing us out. Go! Get lost! Gelso! I have a beautiful gift. What is it? - You tell me first. - No, you first! - No, you first. - No, you first! You first! Marinella cut her finger in the centrifuge, Marinella cut her finger in the centrifuge, but when we got back from the hospital, the man from the TV was here, and he said we won. - What? - Yes! All our problems are resolved... Why? Because we will win the competition of "Countryside... Because we will win the competition of "Countryside... "Wonders!" - The official selector said so. - How did Marinella cut her hand? With the centrifuge. I put my hand in and Gelsomina... - Gelsomina did it on purpose. - No! - Gelsomina did it on purpose. - No! They were extracting, then I heard a scream... Why did that man come! He didn't say anything about the laboratory. Nothing, he just tasted... He said, "What delicious honey, miss! He said, "What delicious honey, miss! "I want some more! With a honey like this, you should win the competition! "It's wonderful!" That's what he said. Who the fuck had him come? When we got back from the hospital... When we got back from the hospital... - The hospital? - Yes, for... Yes! We got back from the hospital, and he was here tor the selection. He was here, that handsome, elegant man... Who had him come? Who had him come? Coco, I'm talking lo you! He was already here... I did. And you didn't tell me. No. They've been to the hospital. - Did they hurt you! - Yes. You're bullshitting me! Dad... - He always goes overboard! - Forget him. You know all the money? If we win, he can have a luxury lab. You know all the money? If we win, he can have a luxury lab. I don't care. Tell me what the hospital said. Do I give her antibiotics? - Did she have a tetanus shot? - Yes. Where's the gift, Dad? Where's the gift, Dad? Where? It's just for Gelsomina? For who? Gelsomina. Dad? Thank you, Dad! Dad? Dad? - Should I do anything? - No. - Can I do something! - No. Dad? Your attention once again, please. We will soon reach the island. Don't get lost. Follow the signs to reach the necropolis. I repeat, follow the usherettes and stay with your colour group. Thank you. Turn towards us. Wave to the viewers. Perfect! First the blues, they're the fishermen, then the greens, the hunters, First the blues, they're the fishermen, then the greens, the hunters, then the reds, the cattle farmers, the ones with the singing old lady. Thank you. The group of jurors, not here, over that way. You come with me to the red area, the cattle farmers' area. You'll see your mother, your sister, your cousin... - And my grandma. - And your grandma. Ma'am, do you feel like singing? No. We're hereto rehearse, you should sing. - No. - Sing, ma'am, it's important. - Grandma, sing! - No! - You have to sing! - I said no! OK, then you sing! Wonderful! A round of applause! Did you hear that, jury members? We did, and I can say they were exceptional. Please, our expert. Good evening to you all, and to the viewers at home. One question. Why are the paintings of famous painters exhibited in museums, but not masterpieces like these singers? Right. We're in the tomb of the Blue Whale, among the descendants of a mysterious people, the Etruscans. We know little about them, their writing is almost illegible, but we can understand a lot from their drawings. For example, they raised animals like the son of that lady. No, her nephew. Producer of sausage, ham and other delicacies. That's right. We do everything ourselves, they're homemade. We've been in pork production for a long time. And we've always watched you, always, always, and never missed a competition, and for me, winning it has been my secret dream for ages. May I say something? Milly, you're a beautiful woman. - Thank you. If your wife knew... - I'm single. Unfortunately, women don't come to live in the country. They're used to luxury and commodities. If you won the prize, would you travel with your grandmother? If I won, I'd use the prize to turn my farm into a country B&B, so that people can admire our natural beauties. So tourists would come, especially women tourists! I'd welcome them with open arms. Very good. Thank you. Now let's change contestants. Lets move on to the family of beekeepers. This funny man comes from far away, and with his family and his children, produces delicious honey. Can you explain how it works? It's honey that's... natural and... virgin... and natural... we don't add anything. We take the bees to the flowers. You don't take the flowers to the bees? No, it's the opposite. Is there any other special thing, a secret we should know about this lovely tradition? Yes. I'd like to say... Certain things can't be bought. I was saying... - Talk to the viewers. - Yes. When we work this honey, it is completely... The world is about to end... That's right. There are things that can't be bought, and this makes me think of the work of these two brothers. They dress differently, they have different weapons, but just one passion. The Etruscans used lances, arrows... But here... Good evening, what are your names? - Excuse me. - We haven't finished. What's that, darting? We wanted to do a little show. A little show? Let's go with the little show. Please go on. Wonderful. Great! And now, let's go on... The dance! Music! You were beautiful. Yes. The most beautiful of all. So were you. So little. Your tiny hands! You're beautiful. - So am I, I'm beautiful. - Yes. - Yes. I am very beautiful. - Yes. I'm a knockout. Of course! - Who's there? - He followed us! Martin. Come down! - Come out of the dark. - He doesn't understand you. You always hide yourself. That's not good. - He doesn't understand. - He understands everything. Come here! When there are two human beings, they must love. What are you saying, Coco? And touch, like this. See, Martin! Like this. You also have to touch. Like this. - And kiss. Like this. - No! Oh, yes! Kiss each other. No. Darling. Shall I show you how Do you want to see! - I'll show you how, OK? - No. Yes. No, no! What are you doing? No! See what you did? Martin! There she is! She's coming, the little Etruscan! Thank you. The winner is... Mr Portarena. Good for you! A round of applause for Mr Portarena and his wonderful grandmother! Excuse me. It's late, please get on board. Tell him to blow the horn again! Can you blow the horn again! The Carabinieri can help, they're staying. My daughter's missing, two little children! They're with an adult, who's responsible, they're not alone. - It's late, we have to go. - Come on, the Carabinieri will find them. We have to go now. Dad? Where were you? What did you do? - Tell me, damn it! - Calm dawn! - Let go of him! - Calm down! Calm down! - How are you? - Let me go! We can't find him. - What? - We can't find Martin. That's enough! What? Wolfgang, they said he left on another boat. - What? - He left on another boat. - Are you sure? - That's what they said. It's strange, a child, alone... Look. Do you have a hankie? What? - A hankie? - No. - Come here! - Me! Me? Sit down. I'm tired. Go on... - Why don't you take the camel too? - What for? - Just a circus! - What? - Just a circus! - Right, a circus!
