- We gotta head back. - What? - Let's go back. - Why? Not here. Let's go. Stop! Let's go. Ok. - Stay with me. - What? You heard me. - You want me to return? - Yeah. No way I'm coming back here. I'm so over this place. What if I move to the city? - You can't be serious. - I am. How many times did I ask you to come to the city with me? - You pull this shit just now? - Been doing a lot of thinking... Many things have changed lately. It's a tough decision to make. I gave it a lot of thought, and I'm ready to give everything up for you. Everything. IN THE QUARRY Finally! I was running short on firewood! - You were gone for two hours! - I got you some logs, Tola. Nice! Rekindle the fire for me, Tincho... I'm in the middle of something. Pressing issues... - I'm going for a swim. - Wait, Bruni, I'll go with you. It kind of bothers me that this guy keeps ogling you. It pisses me off, you know? He's a long-time friend. Don't give me no crap today. "Don't give me any crap." - Say it. - Any crap. You fucked him? You did, didn't you? When you were kids? Was he your boyfriend? Your childhood sweetheart? - No. He was just a friend. - Really? You saw him the last few times you came? - Watch out for the shark! - Hey! Don't do that. - There's a shark. - I noticed. - It's coming for you. - Hold on... Stop pinching me. Can't we stay like this? Like, the whole day? Say yes. No. Guys, can me make a video to get this chick to come over? - Chick? More like little girl? - She ain't a little girl! - But she is, Tola. - Jerk. - I'm a jerk, but she's a little girl. - Get ready. What's up, Pao? Check this out. The whole gang is here. Take a look at this. Full on grill. Half empty cooler... The quarry... Look at that blue sky! It's a beautiful day! The lake... and the swans. Here's today's first contestant. - Say hi, Ali. - Hello! She's our mermaid. Look at those gorgeous eyes. - This is Bruno. - Hi. He comes from the city. What a stud! And, last but not least, my bro, the one and only... Sausage boy! He's trying to do a trick... - Hi, little girl! Come join us! - Don't say that. - Come, Pao! - Over there is... Be careful! So there you have it. Come join us. Later, gator... I'll be waiting. Will you put out some of your famous buds, Tola? - Wanna share a doobie snack? - Mos def. Sweet. - Will you roll it, Ali? - Sure. I love the joints you roll. - Don't let the ball drop. - Ok. I love this game! - Sorry. - Are you hurt? I'm OK. Let's go somewhere else... This fucking rock's on the way. What was that about? Shuffle mode's a bitch. If you don't mind... That girl drives me crazy I see her walk the dog and I wish it were me Long hair, mini-skirt and a tank top I'm madly in love with her There's only tape holding the batteries. The batteries came off of your crappy boom box, Tola. You're loaded now, get a new one. This fucking thing! They come off when you raise the volume. It was too loud, anyway. You say that 'cause you're not into cumbia music. The other song was even worse. With all the reverb... - But... - No, I agree. He's right. It's nice to enjoy the quiet. Slowing down a bit, right? Hear the silence. Beautiful. Alrighty then... So, you've been to our boring-ass town. This shithole is the closest thing we have to a beach. - You call this a beach? - Right. There's also the creek that runs thru town. That doesn't count. I don't know how people still go swimming there. It's beyond me. Why don't they come here? Well, for starters... - it's kind of far. - 10 km is not that far! That's because you came by car. People don't want to walk this far. It's just 10 km. 10.8 km, to be precise. From the town square to the quarry's gate. That's the exact distance. So, it's far from town and people don't come because, even though it's abandoned, swimming is forbidden. Too dangerous. Well, you sure have found a use for this hole. It is a hole, indeed. A hole... but ain't it awesome?! When the mining of the quarry stopped, a new ecosystem emerged and turned into this paradise. I love this place. The water is awesome. The cliffs are great. - Let alone the wildlife. Right, Tola? - I'm scared of tiger turtles. - Tiger turtles? - As a kid, I was terrified of them. - They were said to be venomous. - They are! - Don't be ridiculous. - But they are! - It's a myth. - A myth, my ass! It's like any other animal. Step near it and you may get bitten, that's it. - What the fuck are tiger turtles? - They're giant turtles. - "Giant turtles", sure... - Yeah, massive. - There're bigger turtles, man. - I'd like to see you get bitten by one. Still, tiger turtles aren't the issue, venomous or not. The real danger here lies in the quarry itself. It is treacherous. You get in and it's only one meter deep. - Take a step, you're 20 meters below. - In the middle, it goes down 40 m. - Forty meters deep? - Yeah. Even if you know how to swim, the temperature will get you. At surface level, the water's warm, but deep down it's colder. You dive in, get thermal shock and suffer a heart attack. - Remember when we came as children? - It was so awesome. Our parents hated this place! We would hang out here all day. We stayed real late once, and they came to fetch us, mad as hell. - Tola got... - A massive ass spanking! - Courtesy of Ali's folks. - They were so pissed! - It was quite the slap. - How long were you grounded for? Dad didn't want me to hang out with the boys. - Understandably. - We were up to no good. - Up to no good? - Small-town people are tough. Those of us who stay must have each other's back. Some move to the city... Do you know anyone who has? - Not a single person. - Me neither. - You haven't visited me once. - Haven't we? Bruno, do you find Ali's parents too small-town for you? No. They're not that bad. Still, you've come back a bunch of times and never asked me to come with. Why didn't you tell us you were in town? I came back to see Grandma, which was a handful. Fan-fucking-tastic. Great. - You could've made some time for us. - I'm here right now, ain't I? Were you aware of these sneaky visits? - You live near her place, don't you? - Drop it, Tola! - We're together now, aren't we? - We are. Remember when we used to jump off the top of the cliff? The diving competitions we held! Remember that fat guy? - He landed flat on his pouch! - His chest must be still sore. His cholesterol must be off the charts! - Poor guy. - Yeah. - He must be dead by now. - Don't think so. Some character. I see people come here to check out their phones. Good reception? I'm trying to get a chick to come over. I'm so hot for her. Are you against cellphones? A technophobe? No, no. I'm not against cellphones. The thing is, I'm on the phone all week because of work... - You work from your phone? - Don't we all? - I don't. - In the city, everyone does. - I see. The city equals phones. - Yeah. Cool. What I meant is, when you manage to get away... - it's nice to go off your phone. - "Get away". Back to nature. - Out of the city. - No phones. - Exactly. - Yeah. Pass me the salt, Sausage boy. - "Sausage boy"? - Just a stupid nickname. Locker room talk. Don't ask. - Yours is "Bruni", right? - Yeah. Fuck! What's so great about this shithole? Shall we head back? Don't... We gotta head back... - Bruno... - Let's stay a bit longer. Let me go, Bruno. Don't... I mean it, Bruno. Babe? C'mon, we gotta head back. They're waiting for us. - Some fish stole the bait. - Really? Yeah. Fuck this shit. Oops... Sorry. My bad. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Hoping to catch some tiger turtles? No. More like wolf or catfish. Though a tiger turtle may bite by accident. Do you make these strings yourselves? - They're longlines. - Longlines. - Tincho made them. - Alright. - Wanna try casting it? - I'm not big on fishing... - Go on! It's fun. - You think so? - Yeah, it's easy. - OK, then. It's simple and fun, you'll see. Grab this end and let me reel it out. Make it spin and release it. Watch out! - Good job! - The line! What the hell, man. - You didn't tell me to hold on to it. - Unbelievable. - First timer much? - It's not rocket science, Bruno. - Unless you step on it, it's gone. - Like I always say, blame it on weed. True. It's 'cause of the weed. Let's get those sausages. Cool. C'mon, Tincho. Tincho is so pissed. He's seeing red. Let's eat. - Those sausages look great. - Yummy. Just in time for lunch. Help yourselves. This is so good, Tola. Delicious. So good. This chick's in the bag. - Do I know her? - Yeah. She's the daughter of the guy who owns the supermarket. - But how old is she? Fifteen? - No, she's eighteen. - No, she isn't. - She is! She's just a little girl. He should be in jail by now. - You're 27, right? - Yeah, so what? I mean, it can't be easy keep up with a high schooler... She's of age and about to move to the city to go to college! - Really? - Yeah. Agronomy school. - Nice. - Good for her. - See? - Good, good. Leaving this shitty town... must be reinvigorating. I'm happy for her. Too bad you have to stay behind... all alone. - You can have it. - Go ahead. - Be my guest. - No, I mean it. - You went first. - I'm telling you to have it. - You won't end up a spinster. - As if that could ever happen. Single for life! - Shall I bring the meat? - Sure. - Need a hand with anything? - Slice up some bread. I'll put the bread on the grill to toast. OK. Watch out for the live coals. Looks good! This is the best meat in town. Tincho and I are grilling pros. - Our barbecue is top notch. - Really? Gotcha! I got a bite. Hurry up! Go, go, go. For fuck's sake! It was a big one. It was massive. Good thing the fish escaped. Such a peasant-like thing to do... Killing animals, I mean. We have plenty of food, don't we? So far, he's only fed the fish. So? "A peasant-like thing to do"? - You mean what I said earlier? - Yeah. It's just that... I mean, people inland tend to... People are really into hunting and fishing. That's all I meant. It's not that we're "into" killing animals... - We don't kill for sport, we eat them. - If I want fish, I get it at the store. That's not the point. I live near a supermarket, too. - I can buy fish there, goddammit! - I doubt it'll be fresh. But that's not the issue... We have plenty of food, why do you need more? But we do get fresh fish. A truck comes by every week... - That's irrelevant. - There's magic in fishing. Waiting for the right time to pull. Learning to be patient. I beg to disagree. Me personally, I'm not into fishing or hunting... - I fail to see the magic in it. - I beg to disagree. Let me explain one thing: What if one of your fishhooks caught one of those turtles? - Would you eat it? Leave it for dead? - Drop the subject. - So? - So what? I thought you were going to explain something to me. - May I explain something to you? - Go ahead. First, like we told you earlier, they're called tiger turtles. Should you catch one, remove the hook, put it back in the water, and it'll swim away alive and well. It doesn't have to die. - What about the gaping wound... - Enough! "Gaping wound"? The hook has one single barb. - Try biting on a fishhook yourself. - Drop it! Why don't you try coming at me with a fishhook? - Enough already! - Drop the subject, dude. - Do you like sushi? - Yeah. We both do... Where do you think the fish comes from? Is it organically farmed in ponds? No. I think you haven't fully grasped the concept of "organic", though. Alicia, tell him how we always go for sushi on Fridays. I took her once and she loved it. We go every Friday now. - Really? - Go on, tell him. - She loves it. - So? - Do you eat sushi now? - She loves it. Right? We go for sushi sometimes. Good. Betcha if I caught some wolf fish you'd chow it down in no time! - For sure. - You would, wouldn't you? - I'd make you wolf fish sushi. - If you're the chef, for sure. - Let's eat the beef... - Yeah, it's getting cold. It's delicious. - Don't get all worked up about it. - I'm cool. Forget about it. Don't be mad. Am I overthinking things... or you've been hiding something from me? The nerve on that guy! I see the way he looks at you. When you came with the excuse of your dead grandma... - Will you deny you saw him? - "Excuse"? You're playing the victim card now? Your dead grandma is not the issue. - So? Is the little girl coming? - She ain't a little girl. She is. Is she coming or not? She needs to get her dad to lend her his truck. WHY ARE YOU IGNORING ME? ARE YOU OK? STOP TEXTING ME. SEND That girl is driving me crazy I see her walk the dog and I wish it were me The Grand Canyon has nothing on this. Look at this view! It's pretty deep, right? It used to be, but it looks shallower now. Not much rain lately. - No way I'm jumping in. - Me neither. - Don't overthink things. - Fuck yeah! Let me get this on video... Go ahead. You went in head first, you maniac! I'd only jump feet first! - The water's awesome, dude! - I'm not jumping. - Come on, Bruni. - I might as well jump. Go on, jump. You won't believe the adrenaline rush Live life to the fullest! - Is it deep? - My toes don't reach the bottom, so... It's pretty deep. - Jump, I'll film you. - You think? But it's such a long fall... Don't be a pussy, Bruno. Just jump, don't overthink it. Shall I jump? Go, I'll get it on video. Go, Bruno. You're ripped, dude! Here I come! Go for it. - I hit some metal rods! - What? They're everywhere, man! I have a gash on my leg. - Why didn't you warn me? - How could I know? - Are you hurt? - Are you fucking kidding me? I landed on the same spot as you, there's all kind of shit. Don't jump. - Should've given me a heads-up! - Learn how to fucking dive! None of us are fucking acrobats, man! I see. My sincere apologies. I'm sorry I didn't see the rods. My bad. - Are you OK, Bruno? - Dunno. Let me see. You're such an asshole! You misled me. What? - Are you calling me an asshole? - Maybe we shouldn't jump. Don't be a pussy. - You're the asshole. - Cut the crap, man! - Break it up! - I'll kick your ass! I'd like to see you try. You skinny-ass douche! - Want a piece of me? - I'll kill you, cunt. - I'm right here, you pussy! - Stop acting like assholes! What got into you? Do you really wanna fight him? - He's a jackass. - He's my friend. Your friend almost got me impaled to death. - Don't touch me! - C'mon, it's not that bad. - He didn't do it on purpose. - Didn't he? Tough shit, man. We chose the wrong place to jump. It was nobody's fault. Let's drink beer and calm down. - Are you sure it's nobody's fault? - Drop it. - Cut it out, Bruno. - Bruno, listen to me... I'm sorry, I was wrong. I shouldn't have egged you on. Let's get outta here. Take it easy, man. Shit. - Chill, man. - He'd better stop running his mouth. - He's Ali's boyfriend. - Ali's boyfriend my ass. - He ain't right for her. - What? "He ain't right for her"? What the actual fuck? - We'll be leaving shortly. - Are you shitting me? - We're leaving at once. - I don't wanna leave like this. Let's stay a bit longer. I'll apologize to those clowns if we can leave at once. They'll say they wanna stay and you're our ride, Bruno. Haven't you had enough? We came, ate, went for a swim, jumped into that awful pond. - We're leaving! - I don't want to. This conversation is over. Alrighty, then. It's the last one, Tincho. - We're leaving. - That means we all have to go! Well, then... Text your lady friend and check if she's coming. - Tell her to bring beer. - OK. - Hurry, Alicia. - I'm coming. - The car keys? - Over there. Are you sure you wanna leave? It's such a great day, we have beer. - Please... - It's a long way to Montevideo. Jackpot! We're saved, Tincho. She asks what brand of beer we want. Why leaving so soon? It is a beautiful day, indeed. You're free to go, then. Stop with that phone already! - I'll miss you. - Goodbye, Ali. - Bye. Take care. - You too. Come visit more often. Bruno, it's been a pleasure. I hope your wound heals fast. It's nothing serious, anyway. - Take good care of Ali. - Sure. - We're cool. Let bygones be bygones. - Hope so. Bye, Bruno. Drive safe. C'mon, babe. - Alicia! - Coming! - Say "Hi" to your mom for me. - Will do. Shit! - Who's that from? - Mom's. - What's up? - She wants to know when we'll be back. - Won't you reply? - I already have. - You gotta be fucking kidding me! - What's wrong? When you came with that jackass you left the door open. - So? - That bulb drained the battery. The car'd better start or else... Fuck! We must give it a push. Help me push! Go ahead. Push from the back and I'll push from here. C'mon! - Are you pushing? - It's too heavy! - Let's both push from the back. - OK. Be careful, it's hot. Wait for me to count down! One, two, three, go! Push! Keep on pushing! What happened? It stalled, you moron! You'll drown it, Bruno. Wait. For fuck's sake! What do you wanna do? Let's try again. - Again? - Yeah. We were very close. C'mon. Move. No, leave the door open. At my command. Now! Push! Harder! That's it, keep it up! Mother... fucker! - Give me your phone. - What? - Your phone. - What for? To call a car tow, what else? - What's the number? - 11... 1122124. - 11... - 22124. Hello, how are you doing? My car won't start. The battery's dead. ESN3317. A quarry near Route 34. Close to some town named Suarez. How long? You motherfucking assholes! Go fuck yourselves! - So? - They aren't coming. Give me back my phone. You have terrible aim. - Open your mouth. - Don't. No! What are you doing, you moron? - I'll throw this one at you. - Put it down. - That Bruno was so cranky. - To say the least. He's got a stick up his ass. - True. - Know what he needs? - What? - A good ol' spank in the ass. "I'll leave my phone in the car because... I like being in the woods." "My phone is my livelihood, you know?" - Do you like sushi, Bruno? - "Big fan." "Ali and I go for sushi all the time." "Fishing is such a peasant-like activity." - "We city folks..." - You're such a green person, Bruno. "I'm a big eco-friendly guy. Big fan of fish." I'm against hunting animals. Killing animals is wrong. Animals must be protected. Cows give us milk and shade. "I don't kill animals." Hi, guys... What's up? Car battery's dead. It was a good idea to stay, after all. When we went to pick up stuff from the car, we left the light on. Now, the car won't start. That sucks. It's nice in the sun, though. Things happen for a reason, right? It's a beautiful afternoon. Go for a swim, enjoy yourselves. Such a nice day. - Tola... - What? Can you call your girl and ask her to bring some jumper cables? OK. If she's still at home, I'll... - Call her. - I'll tell her to bring jumpers... What was it again? - Jumper cables. - Right. Hi, Pao, what's up? We're having a ball, just had lunch. The lovebirds, Bruno and Ali... Their car won't start. Total bummer. Would you mind bringing some jumpers... - whatchamacallit? - Jumper cables! Jumper cables! Jumper cables. You know, cables for... - For powering up... - With battery clamps at the end... Awesome! Great, then. I just wanted to add... I'm waiting for you. Right on. Bring some cold beer. There's nowhere to buy anything here. OK, then. I love you, too. No, I'm kidding. Bye, then. See you in a bit. OK. No, you hang up. Kidding, she's already hung up. - All set, Ali. - Thanks, Tola. She's on her way with the cables. Nothing to worry. Bruno! Have a beer! It's good. - This is disgusting. Don't drink. - Want something cold, Ali? No. I'm going for a swim. The day's calling for it. I'm sick of this heat. Wanna join me? - Watch out for the tiger turtles! - You'll make me shit my pants! - This fella is going for a swim! - Wait for me, Tola! Here comes the mermaid. The Uruguayan Pam Anderson! - Tiger turtle alert! - Screw you, girl! It's no laughing matter! Coming! Long ball! There's a massive hole here! I'm glad you came back. You're being too obvious. Stop texting me. - Don't get mad. - We already discussed this. Idiot. Go fetch. Go fetch the ball! - So? How's it going? - What time is your friend coming? - At around 6.45. - What time is it now? Dunno. Let me see... What's that? - What are you doing? - It's... It's 6.30. Hold up your hand like this, outstretched, fingers together. Place it under the sun. Check how many fingers away from the horizon the sun is. - Each finger equals 15 minutes. - But I can't see the horizon. Imagine it, then. For me, it's six fingers. Wait, for me it's two. Two fingers to the quarry's edge. 30 minutes. - Right. - That is... About five fingers, which equals... An hour and 15 minutes. - Exactly. - Then... if the sun sets at 8, it must be 6.45. - So you say. - If that's the number... Your fingers are too tiny, Ali. This method is unreliable, Tola. Fingers come in different sizes... - It's an approximate. - How long til sunset? - Two hours. - See? It's pointless. - Your method is a joke, Tola. - Let's check the time. Bruno! Tell me the time! You'll see. Ali, you said 6.00. Tincho, 6.45. And I think it's 6.30. Do you wanna bet on it? Losers pay for the beer Pao is bringing. Wait... Ali! You said 6.00. I said 6.30, and you... 6.45. What time is it, Bruno? I'll pay for the beer all the same. 5.45 PM. This game's rigged! I was gonna pay for the beer, anyway. What are you doing? Give me my phone. - What do you want it for? - C'mon. My phone. Give me the phone! - Give it back. - You want it back? - You pyscho! - You want the phone back? Go fetch it, you dirty slut! - Are you OK? - Yeah. - You don't get to beat her! - No! Stop! - Stay the fuck out of it! - Bruno, don't! I won't stand aside and let this creep beat you! - I didn't touch her, retard! - I fucking saw you! Hit me! - Martin, wait! - Let go of me. Weren't you leaving? Didn't you say so? Pussy! - Get out of here. - You're kicking me out? - Martin, calm down. Stop! - Martin... I'm calmed, seriously, but he better leaves this second. Get the fuck out of here! Go, or you're a dead man! Cut the crap, Martin. That loser isn't worth it. - Settle down. - It's cool. I mean it. He leaves at once or else... - What's wrong with you? - Out of my way, cunt! - What the fuck? Ali... - Bruno, don't! What the fuck, man? Will you chill? - Will you calm down? - Yeah. - Will you? - Yeah. Bruno! - Martin, stop! - Don't do it, man! Will you calm the fuck down? - Stop it, Martin! - What are you doing? Calm down, faggot! Take a chill pill, asshole. Stop it! Martin, don't! Take him the fuck away! I'll kick his ass! - Motherfucker! - Are you insane? Enough already, Bruno. - Cut it out, Bruno! - Leave me alone! It's over. It's over, Bruno. It's over. Get your stuff. We're leaving at once, goddammit. We'll jump start Bruno's car when Pao gets here and good riddance. You're acting like a fool, man. For fuck's sake! What are you doing? - Drop it, man.. - Put it down, Bruno. - Bruno, drop the... - Back off! Move aside, Ali. Will you put that down? Felt nice to prank me, motherfucker? Being a smartass in my face. - I told you to cut it out, wimpy. - Tincho, don't start. Wait! Don't! ¡No! ¡Martin! What's it gonna be? Want to slice my dick off? - Martin! No! - Do it! Martin... Noooo! What have you done? Tincho? Martin? - Martin! - Motherfucker! I didn't kill him... I wanted him to shut up... PAOLA An ambulance. Answer the phone, go on. Answer the phone, Tola! The phone, Tola! - Hand me the phone. - We must call the police. Wait. Calm down. I'm calling the cops. This was an accident, understood? - Accident my ass! You murdered him! - Gimme the phone! Give him the phone! - Calm down. - Make the call, Tola. - Put it down. It was an accident. - Call an ambulance! Or the cops! Wait a sec... Tola? Tola! - I'm OK. - Call an ambulance. Please, hurry! - Unlock it and call an ambulance. - One sec. Shall I order beer? What? Tola? Tola! Lay him on his side. - Wanna help your friend? - Yes, please! On his side. - Move aside. - We need... - We need firewood... - Turn his head to the left. - Hold him like that. - Yes. Paola? There has been an accident. Tincho and Tola fell off a cliff. We need an ambulance ASAP. I'm Bruno, Alicia's boyfriend. We're in the abandoned quarry. They landed on their heads. It's an emergency! - ¿Can you call an ambulance? - PAOLA What are you doing? - What did she say? - An ambulance's on the way. And that phone? It was ringing, so I picked it up. They hanged up on me. So, this is what happened... Tincho jumped off a cliff. He landed head-first on a rod. Remember the spot? As for Tola... He slipped... and fell in the water. There was nothing we could do. Did you hear me, Alicia? Did you? - Did you?! - Don't touch me! I won't. Ever again. Look at what you did. You big slut! - I didn't do it. - You sure? I didn't do it! - Didn't you? - No! - Calm down. - No, no. - Calm down. - But I must get an ambulance! It's on its way. Didn't you hear? I already called for one. I called for one. OK? Calm down. They'll be here in no time. I need you to be very clear on how things happened. OK? Understood? Yes? Don't cry. What happened here? Will you tell me, please? Tincho fell off the cliff and hit something underwater. I can't go to jail. - We'll work something out. - I don't care if you go to jail. - You do care. - No, I don't! - I just wanna help my friend! - Think about your family. Relax. Think about them. You can leave town. But what about your parents? The whole town gossiping about you. About what a whore you are... and how all those men died because of you. Good. Stop crying. Where are you going? To get the first-aid kit from the car. An ambulance is coming. It'll be a sec. You're staying here, nursing your friend. What else do you want? No fucking way! - Where do you think you're going? - No! You're not going anywhere. Like being pinned down like this? Slut! Do you, slut? What will you do now? Fucking whore! I'll show you what's good! Now the three of you will die in this shithole! You'll drown to death! Motherfucker! Fucking cunt! No, wait... No! Please! Please! Help! Help me, please! - What happened here? - Please, let me in! Call an ambulance for Tola! Please, call an ambulance... Tola's hurt!
