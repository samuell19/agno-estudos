The body's been identified. His name was frank doheny. His girlfriend said that frank left early this morning With a friend named denny. Her description of him Matches the one your son gave. - Well, how the hell did he end up at our house? - We're not sure. I tried to start that truck, but it wouldn't turn over. So, it's possible that after denny ki... After the vehicle's owner was deceased, Denny tried to take the truck, But it wouldn't start, so he took off on foot. I mean, your house just happened to be the closest. I'm sorry, But look, that doesn't mean That this guy's done anything to val. - Oh, yeah, you think? Guy blew a hole through his friend, What do you think he can do to val? - Denny, come on, man. - I know, I know. I just need to talk to cherie. - Then call her, like a normal person. You can't keep showing up here like this. It's weird and creepy. You need to stop acting like such a psychopath, okay? - You need to listen to me. - I already told you, she isn't here. - I don't think that you understand. - Wait, uh... I get it. Nobody wants to get bothered at work, But we are here on official bowling team business uh... We need to find cherie because we are playing The hands of doom this weekend And uh...

You need to leave, I'm calling the cops. you should try being a little More thoughtful when someone comes looking for a loved on. Try using your eyes. Can't you see what's happening here? Someone needs your help. - Let's go, come on! - 911. - Yes, I need to report something. - Dave? - Just got a call. Denny's been spotted. - But did they spot val? Is she okay? - We're not sure, I'll let you know when we do, okay? - Let me know nothing, I'm coming with you. - What's going on? Where's mom? - Sweetheart, you father's gonna find her. They'll both be home soon. They will. It's going to be okay. Spencer? Spencer? - Grandma, Can we make cookies? We should have them ready before mom comes home. - Can we please, pretty please? - Honey, that's a great idea. Let's make cookies. - They'll be looking for us by now. You know, we gotta wait until it's dark. It'll be easier to move around then. I... Oh, I knew it. I knew it. Not one other date in two months. Two months! You know what that means, right? You get it? This... I mean this girl, She is beautiful, she could get a date With any guy, any time. She still loves me. She still loves me. - Now that you know that she still loves you, Maybe this isn't the right approach, Because what you're doing, It could drive her away. Maybe she just needs some space. Just for a while, hmm? - I know my girl. I know my girl, no. Too much distance does not make the heart grow fonder, okay? No, she needs to feel loved. - But denny, what about the pictures? - I mean, look how happy we look! Look how happy we look! Look at it, don't we look happy? - Yeah, you do. - That's... That's 'cause we were. We took this trip to california, We called it our honeymoon, And we would just walk the beach every day, And we got like, the sand between our toes and... The water was so sparkly. Cherie would say it looked like dancing angels. And we would watch that green flash uh... That's... Oh, over in the pacific they have... Do you know there's like this green flash, Like, the sun comes down, and then it goes like, pfft! And it flashes. - Oh, yeah. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. - Yeah. It was at pismo beach. Which is the clam capital of the world, the world! - Mm-hmm. - We always said that we'd go back there. I even have the postcard that cherie gave me. The exact spot. And uh... It was just the best week of our lives. - But denny, She put the pictures in the trash. - Yeah, but you don't know that. That could've been a janitor or that lying nurse. I mean... You saw her, there was always people Trying to interfere in our relationship. Always trying to get between us. No, we're... We're going to go back to pismo, You know, we'll have our honeymoon. I'll get a job, you know, everything will be great. Everything will be great. I just... I have to... I just have to get to her. I have to get near her. I have to talk to her, get her to understand.

Mom? - Yeah, he came here with a woman. - Um... Was that her? - Yeah, that's her. - Was she okay? - She seemed fine. - What do you mean by fine? Was she scared, was she hurt, was she... - Mark. - How was her disposition? - Um, it was a little weird at first, But she actually helped calm down that piece of crap. The orderlies were gonna kick him out of here, But she stepped in. - Val did that? - Yeah, good thing too. We didn't even know he was armed Until we saw him leave the building. - Did you see the weapon clearly? - Yes, it was a sawed-off shotgun underneath his jacket. - Thank you so much. - Um...

Denny's always been troubled. His mom ran out on him and his brother, And his dad was really abusive. You know, he was in and out of foster care... And he ended up at an all boys' home. When he joined the army, It only lasted a few months Before he was dishonourably discharged. There was an incident. A violent incident between him and another serviceman. - Your denny's girl, huh? - Used to be. - You're the husband? - Yep. - I hate him too, you know? Biggest mistake of my life. - Yep. - His mom abandoned him, And his dad used to beat him, And then he was in the foster-care system, And then he joined the army, and that was a disaster. - I don't care. He killed your mom. Now he's driving around somewhere With a gun to my wife's head. - I'm sorry. - How'd you end up with a guy like that? - He wasn't always like that. He looked at me like no one ever looked at me before. Do you know what it's like to be loved like that? To be needed like that? - Hey, mark, you two can't be talking. We got a few more questions for you anyways. - Right. I am sorry about your mother. I'm sorry. Yeah. - If you find him, are you going to hurt him? - Not if we don't have to. - I might know how to help. - Do you know where he's going? - No. But he'll come for me. He always does. - She lives right there. I bet she's in there right now. - You can't just March right in there with a shotgun. - Keys? Hello? Hello? - Cherie, it's me, it's denny. - Denny, hi. It's good to hear your voice. How are you, how are you doing? - I'm uh... I'm really good. I'm just... I've just been thinking about you so much. - Yeah? I've been thinking about you too. - Really?

It just if she doesn't love me... What's the point? And I'm not going back in a cell. I've done that. I'd rather die here on the streets just fighting. This is it. There is nothing left for me. - Mark and me went on a honeymoon. To victoria island. It was so elegant. European almost. We went sailing during the day And ate ice cream walking along the harbour at night. The way he looked at me... As if time stopped just for the two of us. But that was a long time ago Before... Kids and jobs and a mortgage. - Life. - It gets in the way. You forget... What you love and why even if... Even if every day, it's standing Right in front of you when you wake up. For christmas... I thought I could get mark something that would Make him remember... How he used to look at me. How precious time is, how it shouldn't be wasted. - What did you get him? - A watch. - Denny, I don't even know if my husband loves me anymore, But I do know that all I want, All I want right now Is to get home to him and my boys. - You do what I say for just a little while longer, and...
