[instrumental music] (Dolly Parton): the great Smoky Mountains. My mountains. My home. And even though I’ve been blessed to travel all over the world, I always seem to come right back here to this place I still call home. Oh, don't you think my home looks beautiful? I am so proud of my theme park here in the great smoky mountains of East Tennessee. It was a dream come true for me. Of course, I have so many memories of growing up here. Not far from here, just over the hill along with my brothers and sisters Willadeene, David, Denver, Bobby, Stella, Cassie Randy, Floyd, Freida, and Rachel. Well, it was good times for us. Christmas was always special. We didn't have anything that money could buy. We made our own toys. We used to exchange things. And we'd go out into the forest with Daddy to cut down a tree which was always great. And we kind of decorated it our own ways. So it was always very special. And of course, this Christmas I would love to give a gift to you. My favorite song that I've ever written Tells a true story from my childhood about a little coat that my mama made for me. And of course, she called it "My coat of many colors." [strumming the guitar] [singing "Coat of Many Colors"] ♪ Back through the years ♪ ♪ I go wonderin' once again ♪ ♪ back to the seasons of my youth ♪ ♪ and I recall a box of rags ♪ ♪ that someone gave us ♪ ♪ and how my mama put the rags to use. ♪ ♪ There were rags of many colors ♪ ♪ and every piece was small. ♪ ♪ I didn't have a coat.. ♪ ♪ Avie Lee! You there, honey? Just wanted to drop off this box of rags on my way to church. Oh, hi, Miss Bass. It's just some store clippings Donations and such. I thought you might want to make a quilt or something. Oh, Miss Bass, thank you so much. But you didn't have to drop 'em off. Lee could've gone by and picked 'em up. Y'all save it for the church. They're singing today. Oh! Avie Lee Parton, you sure have your hands full. Yes, ma'am. ‘Willadeene, help me with the young 'uns. We gonna be late.’ Let's go, Partons. Lord, it's me again, Dolly. Lord, you gave me Daddy's colors and Mama's face. ...But I'm just plain ol' plain. You know, I'd rather be plain ugly than just plain. Then again, I'd rather be dead than ugly. So thank you, Lord And forgive the complaint. (Willadeene): 'Daddy.' Mama, you look purty. [spits] [engine starts] [engine revving] [instrumental music] Oh, no! I got a solo! [instrumental music] My daddy took our family to church every Sunday. Mama made sure of that. But even the worst drought we'd ever seen couldn't compel my daddy to take a step inside. ♪ And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair ♪ ♪ when the saved diverse shall gather.. ♪ ♪ Hey, Daddy.

You look like a harlot, Dolly Rebecca! What was you thinkin'? That I was fixin' up for church. Ain't you always saying, "give your best to Jesus?" Your granddaddy is up there in that pulpit trying to save souls for Jesus and you think a painted face is what I had in mind. I reckon not. Since you about rubbed my face clean off-- Avie Lee, what are you and Lee teaching these kids? Why, we're teaching them to love Jesus Best way they know how, Preacher. Dolly Parton, aren't you at all interested in going to heaven? Why, sure I am, Grandpa. But do I have to look like hell to get there? [Avie gasps] No, ma'am. Oh, no supper for you. - Mom is a monster.. - I'm gonna tear your tail up. Easy, Mama. Easy, Mama, easy. [laughing] Don't you dare laugh. I used to be faster than her. Ooh, I got me a fire-breathing Bible-beatin', holy-rollin' little preacher's daughter. [moans] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [snoring] Come. Mmm.. I knowed you wouldn't stay mad at me, Mama. Daddy says you may be brown-headed, but you was born with a red-headed temper. Your daddy says a lot of things he ought not to. Yeah, like Grandpa Jake ain't never gonna like him on account of he stole you away from him When you was 15 numplucked. And he ain't never gonna be a church-going man. Your daddy goes to church most every Sunday. Yeah, but Aunt Estelle says that you said that he don't go inside so it don't really count. Big ears, do you repeat everything you hear? No, I do not. I ain't never told you about Daddy going to see that strange staring girl's daddy. - Who? - You've seen her, Mama. Skinny girl... ...Big eyes... ...Stare a hole right through you with those spooky eyes. [clears throat] Dolly, what you doing up? You were sent straight to bed with no supper. You talking about Judy. Judy Ogle, the moonshiner's daughter. I don't know what she's talking about, Avie Lee. I got no business with the Ogles. Why, sure you do, Daddy. Remember, you were sayin' [imitating Lee] "this is personal business and don't tell Mama." And I didn't. Now, the reason I went out to Ogle's place was to get a little liniment to rub on old Beulah's leg, 'cause she's plum stove up. - Is that so? - Hmm. Is that why you got some of Beulah's liniment hid up in the barn? [chuckles] In case you get stove up... ...with all that wild berry pickin' you've been doing. [chuckles] You know, Dolly, she thinks this baby's gonna change her whole world. Like they're heart twins or something. She's more excited about this than she's been about anything in her whole life. Well, she ain't lived that long. A minute to Dolly is like a lifetime to everybody else. [laughing] And you should have seen the look on Daddy's face today when Dolly walked in that church looking in front of the whole world like a hoochie-coochie girl. [indistinct shouting] Oh! Hey, baby. [indistinct chattering] Y'all better get back in bed right this minute! - Ooh. - You got school tomorrow. - You ain't the mom, Willadeene. - No, she ain't. She's still my little girl, ain't she, Mama? (girl): ‘Mama, sing us a song.’ ♪ Come on down ♪ ♪ have a look around, ♪ ♪ rich folks livin' in a poor folks' town. ♪ ♪ We got no money but we're rich in love... ♪ ♪ My mama's rock-solid faith was the heart of our family. But we had no idea how much her faith would be tested that summer and how it would affect us all. [instrumental music] (Dolly): In our home, the older kids were responsible For helping Mama with the new babies. It was my turn to take care of the next one And I just couldn't wait. Ain't this the purtiest baby bed you ever seen? My baby's gonna sleep in style. And what do you know about style? I know it when I see it. And for sure, this is style. I reckon you thought your painted-up face Was style too, huh? I like being pretty. Starts on the inside, Dolly Rebecca. I know that, Mama. Denver says I'm as mean as the devil on the inside. - Ohh! - That's why I have to try so hard to paint some pretty on the outside. You still here? You better run... I have to carry their stuff too? Tell those two to learn not to fight like cats and dogs You're their keeper when they leave this house. Thanks, Willadeene. It's like trying to control lightnin'. Mama and Daddy taught us kids The golden rule: ’Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.’ The bullying Sanders clan obviously had never learned that lesson. They were mean to the core. Not now, Rudy! I'm not gonna miss this time. Let me in, you one-legged polecat! [banging on door] ‘Open up!’ [clears throat] [gasps] Dadgummit, Judy Ogle. I thought you was a ghost. I went wet my pants. You mean, ‘wet your pants,’ don't you? (boy #1): ‘Good morning, Miss Moody.’ - Good morning, Miss Moody. - Good mornin'. Come on in. - Morning, Miss Moody. - Good morning, Stella. (Miss Moody): ‘Come on in, Bobby.’ ‘Sit down, David.’ Now, class, even though you are hardly past the cave drawing stage in your artistic development I had planned a very important and crucial end-of-the-year art project. [cheering] No, no, no. There is no reason for celebration. It's not going to happen. (all): Aww!-- Why? Because there is a thief... ...among us. ‘Yes, a thief.’ ‘Takes a low person to steal’ ‘from a school as poor as ours.’ Maybe it wasn't a thief. Maybe it was-- - Spit it out, fool! - ‘Rudy...’ Hush your mouth, Rudy Sanders, or my brothers will shut it for ya. Is that right? You Parton pussycats gonna whup up on us? You bet your bottom drawer they are! And it'll take Doc Comers 20 years to paste your backsides back together. While you do have a colorful way with words, Miss Dolly-- -Why, thank you, Miss Moody, so do you. ...you must contain your animal spirits Before we have World War III in here. Who's she callin' an animal? Oh, don't you worry about that, Miss Moody. My brother says you only have to lift a Sander's shirt 'to see they have a yellow belly.' (Rudy): 'look yellow to you, huh?' Sit down, Rudy. No... ...But it's about to! [gasps] Dolly! Huh? Oh. [Dolly yelping] [laughing] [thwacking] [Dolly yelping] [instrumental music] [sniffles] [chuckles] What are you looking at, Judy Ogle? This is none of your business. If you hadn't been slippin' around Like some kind of ghost None of this would've happened! (boy): 'It's alright, Dolly.' - 'It's over now.' - It ain't over! (Rudy): by the time I'm done, everybody else in this mountain's gonna know 'Dolly Parton's a no-count', 'big-mouth, lying thief' 'that ain't never gonna amount to nothing!' Miss Moody said Dolly stole the paints. Said she hid 'em in her pants. Who knew about Dolly stealing? I didn't steal them paints! Then who did? Look, if you bunch don't fess up, I'mma punish all of you. You can't! 'Cause they didn't know nothing. 'Cause I didn't steal! Then how'd you do all this? Huh? - With your bare fingers? - Shoot, no. I did it with spit and them paints 'that I borrowed. ‘ I tried to put it back, but Judy Ogle was staring me down, and I missed my chance. There's one thing worse than a thief, and that's a liar. I'm ashamed of you, Dolly. We may be poor, but we ain't thieves. [thud] [instrumental music] Let me see. Mmm. I didn't steal, Mama. I know, baby. Daddy don't. It's okay. Come on. ♪ They didn't understand it ♪ ♪ and I tried to make them see ♪ ♪ one is only poor ♪ ♪ only if they choose to be ♪ I just kept lookin' at that beautiful baby bed And I thought...This baby can't just lay under some old rag. No. It needs a quilt as fi-i-ine as its bed. I don't care how many times Miss Meanie Moody whacks me, or those awful Sanders call me names. I don't regret borrowing those paints one bit. [door opens] Whoo! That is the biggest turkey you ever shot. Well, that's 'cause I didn't. It was layin' on the porch with this note like some kind of Indian offerin'. Who's it from, Daddy? Just says that you tried to put the paints back and got whipped 'cause you weren't believed. Is that the story? Yessum, that's how it happened. But you borrowed those paints without askin'. - What do you call that? - Sneaky. 'Cause I knew if I asked for those paints and she said no, then I would hate her forever for being the meanest, most stingiest teacher that was ever born. And then I'd be tempted to just take 'em, which would be stealing. And then my soul would be damned forever to eternal hellfire. So really I was just being the best christian I could be in the situation. See what I mean, Daddy? Yeah, I see if you had a hankering for catfish You could talk Saint Peter himself into coming down to fish on Friday. This is, if you even make it to the Pearly Gates 'which ain't no done deal yet.' So let's let it be known, Dolly, from here on out That the Partons aren't borrowers either. Deal? Deal. [chuckling] Thank you, Daddy. - 'ha ha ha.' - 'love you, girl.' (Lee): 'Ooh, let's dance!' (Avie) 'i can't dance 'cause of my belly.' [indistinct chattering] 'Heavenly Father, we just thank you so much, Lord,' 'for always taking care of us' 'and givin' us everything we need.' Mostly, Lord, I wanna thank you for all these children That are so special a gift to me and their daddy. For Willadeene who's dependable and faithful and my special angel. 'For David, strong and dependable' 'just like his daddy.' 'For Denver, who's so honest' 'and never tells a lie even if it behooves him to do so.' 'For little Bobby, who's got a heart' 'as big as these mountains.' 'For our Stella who's quick, smart and sees everything' 'that so many don't.' And our sweet Cassie who's sweet and beautiful 'inside and out.' And of course, little Randy who always keeps us laughing. Especially, Lord, I wanna thank you for my husband 'who works so hard to feed this family.' A-a-an-n-nd.. (in unison) Dolly! (Avie) 'Oh, yes, and for our little songbird' 'who carries the hopes and dreams' 'of this family in her heart.' And little Larry. Yes, Lord, and we thank you for this little one For little Larry, if he is half the blessin' that Dolly believes him to be, then we are twice blessed, Lord. 'Thank you for this bounty and the hands that delivered it.' 'And please, Lord, just bring the rain so that we can--' Well, amen. Let's eat. [baby cooing] - Who's Larry? - My baby. My boyfriend. [laughing] [instrumental music] God sees everything, don't he, Mama? When I sing.. ...I know he's watching me. I feel it. That's how I know I'm gonna be a big star one day. 'Cause if you're knocking on God's attention... ...I can hold the world's. You mean you really wanna leave your home and go off where you don't know nobody? I couldn't do that. I ain't leavin' nobody. I'm taking y'all with me. And it ain't a world full of strangers, Mama. I feel like it's a world full of friends I just ain't met yet. [chuckling] I do love how you think, Dolly. [sighs] You're the only one. Everybody else makes fun of me. Thinks I'm just stuck on myself. 'they say, "the whole family can sing"' 'which they can.' Then what makes me so special? Your singin'... ...it pours out of you like a bucket filled with holes. It's a gift, from him that made you. 'If you feel God speaking directly into your heart' You know it right here. And what you know... can't nobody take from you. Come over here and sing for Mama, sweet girl.

It's all done, Avie Lee, sure will be nice up there. The kids is quiet. - You need anything? - She needs some rest, Lee. I know, Preacher. That's why I think 'it's time company left.' Can we pray together before I go? No! I'd rather not. Thank you, Daddy. - I love you. - I love you too, baby. [sniffling] [sighs] How can he think I'd be willing to hit my knees After what happened today? For God's sake, Lee, if not now, when? I'm sorry. I just feel like my nerves are open outside of my body. I just need some time. Alone. She's taking this hard. Lee's been down in he living room. My daughter had done that more often... one on her and one in her. - Daddy! - Daddy! Well... '...Isn't it what everybody says when they think' 'we ain't listening?' 'We just gonna pretend that Avie Lee ain't having these' 'babies one after the other after the other.' Now, no break at all? My little girl is just plum wore out and heart broke. 'What kind of a man does that?' Alright, alright. Let's go! Don't be scared. I ain't leaving you in the dark. Ever. Grieving in a child is a powerful thing. When that little baby died, the one I had called mine before I could ever see him or him see me and see how much I loved him, well, I thought I just might die too from the grief. I had never felt more alone. [birds chirping] Grieving for Larry and my anger at God seemed to take up all the space I had inside me. Summer turned to fall, and school started back again. Daddy pulled the boys out of school to help him in the tobacco field. Mama didn't say a word. [instrumental music] I hated school even more without David and Denver there. The distance between Mama and Daddy grew and her depression deepened. Causing her to stay still. Caught between two worlds. Mama's absence from our lives created an emptiness that grief rushed in to fill... ...for everybody, especially me. Mama... ...You wanna run this out to Daddy in the barn? 'He hasn't eaten.' And you haven't seen him in days. Just get one of the boys to do it. Mama, the boys are out there with him. 'They work with Daddy now, remember?' He would have been born about now. Sometimes... ...I still feel him inside me. Instead of up there. And if I sit very still... ...I can see his little spirit moving up on the hill. That ain't no spirit, Mama. That's just Dolly. Dolly goes up on Angel Hill. No. Dolly's afraid of the dark. Where's ours? I'm hungry enough to eat the north end of southbound cow. On the stove, go get it. - And don't wake Mama. - Mama's already in bed? Mama's always in bed. Or staring out the window. Don't you see what's happenin', Daddy? Oh, she's just going through something, Willadeene. We never lost a little one, but she'll get over it. When? She ain't cookin', let alone eatin'. She don't clean, she don't fool with the kids. Have you ever seen her sit in a chair without a needle in her hand or some kind of work? Mama ain't sewing, Daddy. - Dolly ain't singin'. - Dolly's always singin'. Dolly ain't sung a note since the day the baby died. Look, I'm doing the best I can. But I ain't Mama, and I never will be. If you don't get her up, this family's gonna fall apart. No, it ain't. He's gone, Avie Lee, but Dolly's still here. She needs you. Get up. Come on! Your songbird don't sing no more. She lost her voice. And you're the only one that can help her find it. I know we're not living like a man and wife right now, Avie Lee, but we got eight kids. I can't raise them without you.

I didn't wanna take your hope away. And because I hoped too. If I'd known it... ...I wouldn't be hurtin' so much right now. - I wouldn't-- - you wouldn't have what? You wouldn't have loved him? Don't you ever wish you hadn't loved, baby. There is nothing on this earth more powerful than love. It's stronger than death, don't you know that? I know about Jesus coming back from the dead and all that, Mama But what's that got to do with little Larry? Do you think little Larry's coming back? - That's what that's for? - We'll see little Larry again. But not here. Now this is for you. You're making me a baby blanket? I'm making you a coat. A coat that nobody on earth has ever worn. A new coat just for me? I mean, unless you don't want it. Stella needs a new coat. Stella can just wait. She ain't getting my new coat. What's she doing? How do you cheat on a writing test? Miss Parton, front and center. What did I do? Not you, sweet Stella Mae. You. Since you were so interested in talking during your essay test, you can be the first one to read yours aloud. Alright, now, Dolly Please tell us who your favorite famous person is and why you admire them. Why, that's easy, Miss Moody. It's Miss Dolly Parton, rising star of the Grand Ole Opry. [scoffs] She was born on a cold winter's night In Locust Ridge, Tennessee. She was singing before she could talk. Doc Thomas swore she came out screaming in the key of "e." Yeah, I bet. Hey, this is my paper, and I can write what I want. You compelled me, Miss Moody, but I get to say my piece, don't I? Tell me more about this star, Miss Dolly Parton. Well, I... She was always writin' about music. Not just her people, no, but by the very mountains themselves. What do you mean by that? I mean, ever since I was a baby, I always heard it. The music. Mountains make music that sound like angels singin' 'or devils fightin', depending on the weather and their mood.' She's had a heavenly choir in her ever since. And then Miss Moody wrote on my paper "Miss Dolly Parton, I think you got some real potent tales for expressing yourself in writin'." [chuckles] And what exactly do you think she means by that? - I have no idea. - I think that was good. I think she meant potential. Dolly has potential as a writer. High praise coming from Miss Talulah Moody. She's a college girl, you know? She's the smartest woman I know. Since when? Since she's seen my talent. Here, Dolly, try this on, baby. I need to see if it's long enough. Miss moody told me to keep working on my paper And read it to the class next week. Can you have my coat done by then, Mama? I gotta wear it for my readin'. Well, I'm gonna need something extra special for the lining. I brought this for your coat, Dolly. [Dolly gasps] - Oh! - It's from my wedding dress. Oh, thank you, Aunt Estelle. - It matches my eyes. - I know. (Denver) 'I got some old dirty drawers you could have, Dolly.' Nice color brown that matches the dirt behind your ears. (Dolly): As Mama worked on that coat You could start to feel the life Flowing back in our little mountain home. Something dark had tried to steal our joy, but with every color, every stitch that Mama sewed on that coat, the darkness receded and the light flooded in. Mama, tell us a story of Joseph and those mean brothers again. Okay, well now... Joseph was a beautiful boy. 'So loved by his father and even more loved by God.' But his 12 older brothers didn't like him always talking about his dreams of them kowtowing to him. Yeah, so, they dug a hole so deep that they couldn't hear 'his bragging and his yapping, and they threw him in.' Yeah, but they ended up bowing down to him all the same. Didn't they, Denver? He might've started out in a hole, but he ended up a king. So Joseph saved his people. And from those people came Jesus. And He saved us all. Alright, I think it is done. Try it on, let's see if it fits. - Help her, Willadeene. - 'Okay, you ready?' - Go on. - Okay. Okay. Give me your arm. Okay. - How does it look? - It looks perfect. I love my coat! ♪ But I was rich as I could be ♪ ♪ in my coat of many colors ♪ ♪ Mama made for me. ♪ ♪ 'Cause she made it just for me. ♪ [instrumental music] Mama, what's wrong? I had a dream last night. Something's comin'. Dark and devourin'. Where is she? Here she comes. Ooh! It looks like she slept in it. - No, it doesn't. - It looks right as rain. And how about you? You ready to read your paper today? I'm ready to tell the world all about me and my destiny and how God gave me the gift-- - Everybody, get in the fields. - No, no, no, we can't, Daddy. - Not today. - This can't wait, Dolly. We got hornworms. They're eating through the lugs. If they get to the upper leaves, we're done for. Denver, David, y'all go get some buckets at the barn. Willadeene, Bobby, go get the water jug. Hurry, babies. But my coat? I'm doing my readin' today. Miss moody says I might be able to enter a contest and I-- I just can't pluck bugs, not today. Just go on, Dolly. Stella, you go with her. Bless you, baby. You can tell Mama all about it when you get home, okay. Thank you, Mama. Oh, thank you. - I love you. - Come on, Stella. ♪ I was rich as I could be ♪ ♪ in my coat of many colors ♪ Hey, wait up. I don't want to get to school same time as her. Why not?

A royal fool, might as well wear garbage and call it gold. Rudy, that's enough. I'm ashamed of you. Come on, darlin'. Let's go. Let's go. Go on in. Now stay out a minute. Alright, Dolly, we're just gonna get that coat right off-- I'm keeping it on, Miss Moody. It will be less distracting if we just put it in the closet for now. Believe me, Miss Moody, it'd be more distracting off. I don't have anything on underneath. You are not wearing a shirt or anything underneath your coat? My only shirt was dirty and so is my dress. I never planned on takin' off my coat...ever. Don't you worry about a thing. I'll just run downtown and pick up somethin' quick From Mrs. Bass. But what about my readin', Miss Moody? What about the contest? Can I still do it? [laughing] Of course, you can, Dolly. If you're ready, we'll do it right after lunch. [screaming] [laughing] It ain't funny. It's pretty funny, Willadeene. Get to pickin' if you wanna eat this winter. - Oh, I got a big one. - Oh, man, that's a big one. - Hey there, Daddy. - Here's another one. Hey, honey. He works day and night. No rain, so the leaves are burnin' off Before they're ready and now this. It's like we can't keep nothin' alive. David, get Randy, he's got a hornworm. Yes, Mama. Come on, baby Randy. Lord, that young'un will put anything in his mouth. Well, I reckon a hornworm's better for him than the dirt. Got more protein. How are things at home, honey? Had you and Lee have some kinda fallin' out or somethin'? Me and Lee don't have a problem. Now, Avie, I know from experience That in troubled times, folks can-- Well, they get to fightin' and then-- We didn't have a fight. We had a death. I love you, Daddy, but you don't know beans about me and Lee. I know that two or three nights apart ain't gonna break a marriage. But now, too much time, that can, that can make some... ...dangerous territory. And the Devil will get in there and he will start sowing seeds of doubt and before you know it, that marriage is broke. You think Lee's gonna leave me? Do you? I don't know. After the baby died, I pushed him away. He just ain't found his way back yet. Well, then you need to shine a light. You need to help that boy. He ain't like us, honey. He don't have the Lord to follow. You're about as close to that as he gets. And that can be a tough road home. But it's yourn. Dolly, come outside. Got nobody to play with or talk to. Just Judy. That'd be like playing with your shadow. Here I am doin' everythin' to get ready for my readin' and you're botherin' me about playin'? How could you be so selfish, Stella? You old sour pickle, I'm leavin' to go help Daddy. How's that for selfish? [sighs] I told you get on out of here. We wanna see your famous coat. You-you've seen it. And Miss Moody will be back from town any minute, so just get-- Miss Moody ain't here now, so she can't help ya. Gloria kinda likes your coat. Why don't ya let her try it on? - Don't you touch my coat. - Come on, Dolly. Let Gloria try on your ugly coat. It's you who's ugly. I don't care what you say. It is beautiful. You think you're better than us? You think you can sing and you think You're gonna be some big star some day? All you do is brag. It ain't braggin' if it's true. You think you're the only special? Well, I'm special too. Grab a hold of her and get that coat off. I can't look at it another minute. No, stop! [screaming] Let go of me! Put me down! How you gonna like this. Get in there. [screaming] No. No, give me my coat! [banging on door] Let me out! [panting] I'm afraid of the dark. (Rudy): 'what you gonna do?' 'Ow!' [Gloria grunting] [glass shattering] (Rudy): 'Quit it.' 'Ow! Ow!' [dramatic music] [sniffles] They gone? [sniffles] You're better than them. So are you. Don't go. I don't want to be alone. You ain't alone. [birds chirping] [spits] They tore up your paper. I'm sorry. I tried to save it. They can't touch where that come from. I can't believe you took on that crazy bunch. It's hard to get your lips wet. You'll get used to it. I'm just so mad I could spit! Don't cry. They ain't worth it. I ain't cryin' about them. Come on. Oh, here she comes. She'll have a big tale about being the new star of the class and-- Hey, who's that with her? Judy Ogle, and something's wrong. I'll say! She don't even like Judy Ogle. How could you, Mama? How can you tell me this coat was beautiful and special and fad? When it's stupid and gaudy and made out of rags. It's not like Joseph's. It's just a cheap hand-me-down like everything else we have. What happened? You loved it-- I wanted everybody to love it, and they hated it 'cause you lied. It ain't beautiful or royal. It's ugly. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder-- No, Mama, don't you do that. 'Don't you start talkin' the Bible at me!' This happened to me today! This is real. So is the Almighty, Dolly. Well, He's big enough to take that, ain't He? He takes everything, don't He? He took Larry, 'He took my joy.' And He made a fool out of me. God didn't do that, Dolly. No, Mama, you did. [door slams] That was real brave, what you did today for Dolly. We thank you. I heard y'all had the hornworms. - We did. - We got 'em. Sorry. I mean, not sorry you got 'em Just sorry y'all got 'em in the first place. You see, hornworms is-- What you're eating right now. [all chuckling] Well... ...I'm partial to hornworms. [all laughing] Judy. Hey, Dolly, why's your coat in the rag box? 'cause I ain't wearin' it again. Of course, you're wearin' it again, your mama about killed herself making you this coat. - You're wearin' it tomorrow. - No, I ain't! There's more to the story, Lee. No, there ain't. There is only one story...you. You sittin' here day and night, ruinin' your eyes hurtin' your back tryin' to make something special for Dolly. And all she needs to be is grateful for it. I wouldn't wear that coat again if I was butt naked and it was 30 below. And I ain't never goin' back to that school. Never! Lee. If you care about me, how I think and feel Just sit and eat. [instrumental music] Don't you be lookin' at me! You should be ashamed to show your face! Everybody says God loves him! But that's a lie! You don't love me. You wouldn't have killed my baby if you loved me. He was just a little baby. My baby. You kill the sweet ones I love and let the mean ones like the Sanders live! Well, I know you now! Rudy can't hold a candle to the likes of you! And you just stay hangin' up there and no one can get to you. You're the bully! That's what you are! Well, I spit in your eye, that's what I do! I spit at you! [spits] I ain't sleepin' in that house tonight. (Judy): Blood moon, them creatures would be out.' I could keep lookout. I know it was you... ...that left the wildflowers on Larry's grave, fixed the blanket, brought the turkey... ...and got me out of trouble with Daddy. You've been watchin' over me. That's angel work. 'First time I saw you through the church window' all those years ago, you were reading that same book. Nine kids later, and you're still are lookin' at me through that window every Sunday. Why don't you ever come in? (sighs) What do you want from me, Avie? 'Cause I-I don't know anymore. I mean, you knew who I was when I married ya. 'We're not sharin' a bed, y-you don't want me' to discipline our kids no more. Everything's changed, and I can't get my bearings. Maybe that's because when you look at me, all you see is... ...pain and death now. Oh, that's not true, Avie. You're as beautiful to me today as the first time I saw you. I'm tryin' to protect you. From what? Me. - Lee, Daddy was sayin' today-- - You talked to your daddy? About me and you? Avie... Can't you let me do what I think is right just one time without runnin' to God and your daddy to ask for permission first? Think me and Denver can go back to school tomorrow, Daddy? Yeah, this is most likely the last pick. Without rain, truth is, It ain't even worth buying seed for next year. All we got is hardpan, get to work. Have faith. Buy the seed. Make it rain, I'll buy seed. Only God makes the rain. Not no more, he don't. You ought not to tease her about God, Daddy, it hurts her. I wasn't teasin' her. If she ain't got God, she ain't got nothing. It's her faith that keeps her goin'. The way you were attackin' God, you're attackin' her. So you better get to town and buy that seed. You boys finish up, Deene, take care of the kids. I gotta go buy faith. [church bell tolls] [car honks] [bell dings] (Miss Bass) 'Oh, Avie Lee!' We have prayed and prayed for you, honey. I'm so sorry for your loss. 'God must've needed another little angel.' Well, thank you so much, Miss Bass, especially for the prayers. Please do keep prayin' for us, for our family. What can I do for you folks today? - Cotton candy-- - seed. Biggest cone you got. And a ten pound bag of seed. Are you sure? In this drought? Oh, he's sure. Well, alright, I'll go to the back and get it. It'll be ready before you leave. [instrumental music] Stingy. Want some more? I might. [music continues] No one has seen her since she lost that baby. Well, she looks just awful. Peaked, just terrible. Well, who wouldn't, eight kids already. They can't feed the family they have now. What is wrong with Lee Parton? Same thing you wish your husband would catch. You know, God took that little baby just as sure as this world. I'd say it's a blessin' in disguise. How could the takin' of an innocent ever be a blessin'? Oh, I'm so sorry, Avie Lee. Everybody knows I let my mouth run away with me. Yeah, you got that christian courage When no one can hear ya. You're a damn hypocrite. You all are, calling yourselves christians. Everyone of you can go straight to hell And you can take that seed with ya! Oh, Lord, have mercy. (woman #1): 'I didn't know they were in here.' You didn't have to cuss them. Yeah, I told the truth and nothin' but. They all a bunch of hypocrites up in that church. Everyone no love in'em. They ain't no hypocrites. Mama's not. Estelle, Dorothy, Daddy's not. Well, he ain't running full of love, especially not for me. Now we gonna make this about you. I'm the one that lost my baby. You ain't the only one! You forget I'm the one that held him when he drew his last breath. You always forget that, don't ya? Oh, hell, it don't matter anyway, Avie Lee. You're just gonna cry, and you're gonna pray And we're gonna have more like we always do. Just like the church lady said. [tires screeching] [slams door] [panting] [grunts] [thuds] Are you gonna drive? Or are you gonna dance all night? Well, you know, you can't go anywhere. I guess you're stuck, since you can't drive. Oh, what are you gonna do, huh? You don't even know how to start the truck. Oh, I'm about to finish it. [engine cranking] Avie Lee, turn off the truck. - You don't drive. - You better move! Turn off the truck. You don't drive, turn off the truck. And you don't dance. [instrumental music] Avie Lee! Woman... ...you better stop! [gears cranking] (Denver): 'Is that how you run out the Sanders?' Pulled that buck knife? Of course she didn't. - Did ya? - No. I used the Tennessee flag. Attached to six feet of solid Tennessee hickory. Guys, the Sanders have dogged us all our lives. Now they've gone too far and hurt Dolly. And Judy. They split her lip. It's settled then. Lay low, Dolly. Don't go back to school till we're done workin' with Daddy. 'Then we'll go back with you. We'll go together.' We have to make sure they never lay hand on a Parton again. I'll help you... ...If you need me to. We ain't kin with Ogles. So why would you get in any deeper? She gave blood for me, Denver. We friends. We're friends. Friends fight for each other when they need to. Mama, what happened? Where's Daddy? Where's Daddy? Is he okay? - Just give me a minute. - What's wrong? Just give me a minute. Let me breathe. I was alright till my temper wore off, and then I just prayed for home or heaven, either one, just make it quick. I'll say this once: get in bed. [panting] Well, that was a damn fool thing to do. I got here, didn't I? What? You mad 'cause I took your truck? Or 'cause if I can drive, I don't need you no more. Is that all you need me for? A ride? Well, if this is how church folk act, I'm done with it. You mean me? Don't you, Lee? You done with me? 'Cause I'm church folk. You know, I always thought you were different, Avie Lee. But I'm tellin' you right now, I ain't ever gonna darken The doorway of that church ever again! It ain't like you darkened it in the first place. Even when we got married, you made Daddy do that outside. - And that is a fact. - Well, here's a fact for you. Until I can find more accommodating shelter I'm movin' to the barn. If it was good enough for the baby Jesus it is good enough for Mr. Robert Lee Parton! [door slams] It broke my heart when Daddy moved to the barn. Seein' Mama and Daddy apart... ...Just made us all feel so helpless. Thank you for the books, Miss Moody. They mean the world to me. You're too smart not to be educated, Willadeene. You can't come to us, we'll just come to you. My goodness! I've got to get to school. - Mornin', Mrs. Parton. - Oh, good morning, Miss Moody. I have brought some things for Dolly. Is she still too sick to see me? "sick?" Why, no. Dolly's in school. No, ma'am. [instrumental music] [sighs] Max Factor. He makes up all the movie stars. Here, you try some on. Why would I want to do that? To see what you look like. Don't you wanna be beautiful? Oh, this is a nice color. Ooh, I like these. (on radio): ♪ From your top to your toe ♪ ♪ anything goes ♪ ♪ on you it looks good... ♪ [humming] Dolly. [humming continues] Hmm. I'm dead. Dolly Rebecca Parton. What do you think you're doing? Skippin' school? 'Your sister would give anything to go to school' 'and you just gonna throw it away?' Then let her! She can wear that coat and see how much fun it is! That's why you skipped school? 'cause you was ashamed of the coat I made you? Here. You take it. Miss Moody gave it to you. It's still got the tags on it. Take it. Come on, Dolly. Let's get this over with. We'll be praying for you in heaven, Dolly. (Lee): 'Come on.' She didn't even think twice. - 'Bout skipping school? - We're not taking that coat. [instrumental music] Dolly, there's only one person that holds our family together. Me? No, not you. Your mama. And when she lost our little baby... ...I couldn't stand looking at the pain in her eyes. So I quit lookin'. 'Cause I didn't know how to bring the light back into 'em. And then when I saw you grieving so I knew that the one thing that might help your mama get back on her feet was helping you. 'Cause your mama put all the hopes and dreams of our family into you. Where'd she put 'em? [chuckles] In your foot. (chuckles) God Almighty, girl, in your heart. Oh. Every night, night after night that she stayed up puttin' piece after piece into that coat was sown with love. It was like, Dolly, with every stitch that she was mending our family's broken hearts. Your mama's heart holds all the love for our family, Dolly. And her heart's strong... ...but it can be broken. So be careful with her heart, Dolly. [sobbing] Mama! Mama! Mama. I'm so sorry, Mama. All I ever wanted was to be beautiful like you. But I'm ugly inside and out. 'cause I got a little shriveled up black heart, when all I want is a heart like yours. Big and strong and full of love. [sobbing] After all the things I said and done... ...How can you stand me, Mama? How can you stand and look at such a little worm? Because you're my worm. You're like a little pupa. Just developing its protective shell. And your cocoon, that's your family, wrappin' around you so tight. And when you finally break free... ...You'll have beautiful butterfly wings... ...with beautiful colors... ...that will catch the wind and the eyes of everybody that sees 'em. And those colors, they've always been in there, just too tiny to see until the time is just right. But...How will I know, Mama? Because... ...you'll be able to fly. Mama? Why are those Sanders kids at school so mean? Are they just jealous and full of hate? I think that's what happens when love is missin'. They just go sour. Like milk, sitting out too long in the sun. That bunch don't even give love to each other. I ain't talking about the love they give, baby. I'm talking about the love they get. But...How do I love Rudy Sanders? By forgivin' him. We're called to love our enemies. See, love, it ain't just a feeling. It's an action. You decide to forgive him and that is an act of love. Have you decided to forgive Daddy? There ain't nothing to forgive. I love your daddy now and forever. If you don't remember anything else from the Bible, Dolly, remember this: Love... never fails. [intense music] You want some of this? Fight you any day, Rudy Sanders. Stop! In the name of Joseph and his coat of many colors. Let me through. Make way. I've got something to say. I got a word. Well, it looks pretty even. Pfft, you can act like royalty, Dolly Parton, you as white trash as me. Starting with that coat you got on. You talk down to my sister like that again and I'll bury you like a dead dog. No, no. We ain't fighting today. - We ain't? - We-we are. We ain't. 'Cause love never fails. [scoffs] Figures. Everybody knows the Partons is lily-livered Bible-beaters and prone to cowardice. You ever lost anything, Rudy? That you couldn't get back? Yeah. A nickel-plated comb I won at the fair. Our mama. Rudy...We didn't know. Well, now you do. So, what? It's not going to change nothing. 'Still going to beat the bejesus out of you' your brothers and your pet banshee. We don't wanna fight no more. Do we, boys? No, not really. Where's all this "love never fails" stuff coming from? - A bubblegum wrapper? - Our mama. She knows everything. Your mamma don't know nothing about nothing. She knew you didn't have no love. 'Come to church.' I had a dream. Something big is gonna happen. 'Ours is going to be dinner on the ground.' We's having frog legs and catfish 'and squirrel.' Unless you'd rather have chicken. What time on Sunday? [instrumental music] (Dolly): My Grandpa Jake loved our family. He loved us so much that he didn't hesitate to insert himself into any problems he thought we had. Mama and Daddy's marriage troubles were real and Grandpa Jake refused to ignore them. Mornin', Lee. Preacher. Let me get right to it then. Now, I understand, you bedding down out here in the barn with a bluetick hound instead of my daughter. Bloodhound. Bluetick died. But I think you'd be happy about my new sleeping partner. Alright, I'll admit it. It was hard on me. She wasn't but 15 years old. And she was my prize She was-- She was my gift from God. And you was just... way too wild and good-looking to be trusted. 'But she loved ya.' Still does. The fact of the matter is, I just, I've gotten used to you. And the seven children you blessed her with. - Eight. - Eight. Yeah, I keep forgetting about that boy that eats dirt and worms. - Randy. - Randy. You named one of them after me and I might remember. How come you sleeping in the barn Lee? Oh, Preacher, you know why. You said it that night at the burial. I needed to stay away from her And you were right. Well, now... don't this beat all. Just about the time I was ready to change my mind about you You turned quitter on me. What would you have me do, Preacher? Her and I, we can't even wash our clothes together Without gettin' in the family way. Losing this baby, it almost killed her. And I can't bear it if it happens again and I know she can't. 'So, you tell me, is it better that I just sleep out here' Or go and make three or four babies And then pray my wife survives it. Do you believe in God, Lee? 'Do you?' Do you believe that God loved you enough to die for ya? That he loves you still. He don't make it easy. When I gotta build a pine box And put my baby in the ground. No, he don't. No, he don't. No, sir. But now... son, it is impossible without him. See you at church on Sunday? (Singing): ["Say Forever You'll be Mine"] ♪ Forever is the love ♪ Try comin' inside this time.

We got to come up with dinner on Sunday for the Sanders' clan. Oh, why would we do that? They're awful people. Because Dolly invited' em, like a peace offering. Like Joseph. The only difference between me and Joseph is that he was the second richest man in Egypt, and I'm the second poorest in Sevier county. Lordly, who's more poorer than we are? Oh, well, the Sanders, of course. [laughs] I'm rich in other ways, right, Mama? - You’re one lucky girl. - I'm lucky. Lucky, lucky, Mama. [instrumental music] Why you gettin' all fancy? Think Rudy Sanders is gonna care? Probably won't even show up. Keep a little faith. When you saw me, through the church window all those years ago, little and dark and scrawny and wide-eyed... ...what did you see in me? Hair so long, you sat on it between the hymns and I wanted to touch it. Pray he's not a runner. Be patient, Jake. He's run from the Lord for 15 years. He ain't running from the Lord. He's running from Daddy. It's hard to tell the difference, Dorothy Jo. Huh. - Well, Lee. - Preacher. Looks like Dolly has put together quite a crowd here. You ought to be real proud of her. And those are words you don't hear often. No, you don't. No, you don't. "This is the day the Lord has made." (in unison): "Let us rejoice and be glad in it." (Jake): Amen. Mornin'. Good mornin'. But I thought... ...after last night, things had changed. Avie Lee, I keep seeing His little hand. I don't understand a God that would let that happen. Do you feel that? Warm and alive. Right here and right now. But I won't always be here. One day, you're gonna reach for me and I will be cold as ice and then what? Well, if there's a God like you and the preacher say Then that day'll never come for me. That's your plan? Die first? Do you know where that leaves me? Alone. Forever.

'Cause when I think back on those hard times they're also my best memories. We made peace on our mountain, overcame heartbreak, saved a family and mended a marriage. Dolly, don't you just love that new coat? It's so stylish. They say all the girls in Nashville are wearing it. I do love it. It's a beautiful coat. - I do thank you, Miss Moody. - Of course.

It'd just be too hard on her knowing you gave it to me first. - Alright. - Or Gloria. She's got enough hair on her to keep her warm this winter. Why don't you just keep it? You know you want to. No, Miss Moody. Just 'cause you want something, don't mean it's meant for you. I have the most beautiful coat in the world. But I do have an idea of who needs a coat with a little style.
