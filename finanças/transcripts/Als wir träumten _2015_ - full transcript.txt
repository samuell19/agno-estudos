Mark? Mark, mate, it's me, Dani. Mark, where are you, you stupid asshole? Dani? Are you here? Dani... Mark, my brother. No lights. No lights. I brought you a beer. Just roll it back over here. Okay. I'm so fucked, Dani. I'm so fucking sorry. No you're not. It's the fucking stuff. Go back to the clinic. They'll get you off the crap. No. They can't. They're lying fuckers. You took my needle, held it to my eye, and I didn't give a shit. I wanted you to quit. You can do it. Maybe, Dani. Maybe. But I'm so glad you're here. Our old cinema. Winnetou III. All the fuck-films. What a great time. I know a nursery rhyme. I hum it to myself when everything goes crazy in my mind. I think we sang it when we played hopscotch. But maybe I made it up myself or dreamt it. Sometimes I just start humming and don't even notice because memories are dancing in my mind. No... not just any old memories. The ones of the years when everything changed. BE READY Attention, the school is on fire. Attention, the school is on fire. The paramedics will now be employed. We're in the Civil Defence Competition. A People's Army colonel is present. You pioneers are important partners for your seniors: You're helping them learn to save children should the circumstances arise. Right? Right. And remember: the school's on fire. Hey, Katja! When's our turn? Are we to die here? If I'm buried alive, like this says, I need digging up. I could limp if I had to. Belly-shots commit suicide. Could you shoot yourself, Mark? I need mouth-to-mouth because of smoke poisoning. The broads do it. It's like kissing. What if men do it? It's always women. They press air into you... with their lips. - Let's swap, Dani. Take the belly-shot, it's good. They bend over you. You get to feel their breasts. I don't want to swap. Make yourself lighter! Lie down! Lie down. You've been shot. Water! Raise your arms. What about my belly-shot? Shoot yourself! You're done for. It's chilly out. - And my being unconscious? You'll wake up by yourself. Recovered from your head-shot? Oh, Dani! Well, young man. Two things are vital: Assuming one's place in the group, and thinking along. Aren't you Daniel Lenz, 7b? - Yes. You won the poetry-recital competition. It was beautifully done. - That's the way. Always be active, always run ahead with the collective. That's what makes a good soldier. - Yes, Daniel. You can learn from the comrade-colonel. Hey! Stop! Quit it. Behave yourselves Four years later we were still going to school. We usually drank Leipzig Premium Pils for patriotic reasons. But if we were stealing, we'd take the flashy, mountain-water brands from the ads drunk by cool ladies men. We drank the beer of winners. And if I die, comrades... And if I die, comrades... There's a man in the woods Silent and still... What the hell is this? - Leg it! Come on, hit it! Stop! Police! Anyone hungry? Cheers, my brother! Cheers! We are the greatest! MURDER IN GERMANY Cheers! - Cheers, boys. Cheers, Fred! - How many cars have you nicked? I don't nick them, I hotwire them. I don't acquire property. - Hotwired, then? Forty-two. And haven't ever been inside. One time I rammed the cops. Their fault. I had right-of-way. I had a Daimler, they an Opel. It was knackered. Poor sods couldn't even open a door. And you? I'm waiting for my trial. Nice joint you have here. - I've got it. We didn't have dens like this. - My dad's endangering it. Hey, Starlet. Come in! You sang well. I was about to say that. Nice dress. - I was about to say that, too. Why are you copying me? - I want to make her laugh. Do you belong to Fred? - When I want to. Hey. - Hey. -Hello. Here, a fresh one. I think the cops have got harder. They were hard back then. It's the same ones still. But now you have new possibilities. I've got a defence lawyer. He's asking for acquittal. I was in a home in East Germany. I grew up without love. Lovely you're here, children. You can hand over the cellar keys. - Yes. Evening. - Evening. You can go on up now. Then... then I'll go on up. I think she's blind. She heard me pissing on her fence, we got talking... She pays a tenner for 50 kilos. That's 100 briquettes for a tenner. - She's not poor. -No! It's enough for 16 years. Does she want to live forever? You're strong boys. It's training for us. This is good for me. What a shitty job this is! Did you just fart, Pitbull? - Shut it, Mark. Sit yourself down, children. There's something to drink. This is the way I make grog. You can drink it all year round. I'll get your money in a minute. You can go out to a nice dance. Get yourselves cups from the kitchen. The old girl will die if no one helps. - Bet she gets a big pension. She's glad if we show by. Sweet as sugar! Yuck! This is for you all because you were so kind. Thank you. It's too much. Put one back. You aren't to smoke here, children. Sorry. We didn't know. Look, boys, the Big Dipper! Help! Help! - I'll beat you! Murder in Germany! - You whore. I know them. I'll go give him a smack. -It's no use. Forget it, Pitbull. - Let's go in your cellar. I'll be right back. - Pitbull! I'll jump! Get off! Murder in Germany! Shut your mouth! - Help! Let's go up. Everything's fine. Don't be afraid. Easy now. Easy. Shit! It's you. Where's the guy? - In the kitchen. Just leave us in peace. Don't be afraid, now. It's all right. Everything is fine. It's fine. Shit! Think he'll croak? No, he's just out for the count. We shower him down. The shirt. Hey! - Easy now. I didn't mean to. I just stretched out my arm. We're kind of neighbours, after all. It's all right. - Go on. We'll manage. He'll have forgotten by tomorrow. Don't put him in her bed... please. RIVALRY Too much! My idea! So what goes on in your bar? I sit around and think things over. I'll serve you now. I even have glasses. Original Russian goods. The glasses look like you pissed in them. I used to only drink to be sociable. I've only drank for myself since my papa died. What did he die of? - TB. Drinker's tuberculosis. I'll skip it. - Maybe I will have a glass. And no one else comes here or what? Here? It's dead. The time has come The musicians are ready... To compete for chart positions one through eight... Open up, Mrs Böhme. It's us. Sieg Heil! Something wrong? Who the fuck are you? Why are you here? Draw the bar! - Piss off! It's taken. This isn't your turf. Cool your boots. The dame has long been ours. Wrong! I'll smash your teeth in. You want to spoil our evening, baldy-locks? I can break your nose if you like. Right now. Shit. You don't know who I am. Know Kehlmann? A word from me and 20 guys will come kick your asses. All right. You see? A little scallywag! I'll tell Kehlmann. You're done! - What the hell? There's more to come. You're done, Kehlmann, or no Kehlmann. What's up? It's over. - Come on, Rico. A liver shot. - Is that a good punch? Not for him. - But I wanted to muscle in. Next time, big boy. - Pity they're gone. Someone there? - No, it's fine, Mrs Böhme. But we're off. School tomorrow. But you'll be back? Always ready! Open your books, please. We want to hear the end of the tale. Who'd like to read? Rico? Would you be so kind? No. What do you mean by that? That I don't want to read about sodding Soviet soldiers. And why not? Would you explain why not? And where is your scarf? Katja, would you please read? "The Germans retreated as evening fell. Perhaps they didn't know that there was only one man on the woods' edge: Filipenko of the Red Army. He'd been hit by a bullet and crawled under a bush. His strength was at an end, but since all the others were dead who'd embraced that morning, he accepted his fate. He fell asleep or passed out. He saw the girl in front of him that he had written to twice. When he woke up, he discovered he was being carried. He recognised Gavrilov's voice. They'd found him and were carrying him home. He wanted to say something, but they didn't notice and he died." Gee, it's like setting fire to a flag. This is no petty matter. He must be aware of that. You are friends. - I consider this a provocation. His father is an officer. Meaning what? Well... his father was always his hero. He wanted to be an officer, too, Rico did. And... his father also taught him to box. And now... well... Now he's left Rico and his mother. Cause he's got a hussy in Berlin. What kind of language is that? A hussy! You can say "pussy", too. But... Rico is simply angry... and just loses his temper easily. And he is against injustice. His family affairs do not excuse his behaviour. It's not in his own best interests. Or am I mistaken? His schoolwork has also deteriorated. But I don't want him to have to repeat the year. I don't think anyone should be left behind, including Rico, but... No one should exclude themselves, either. - That's precisely it. Dani, you're a good pioneer. You set your own goals. You want to be a reporter. So you have to distance yourself from Rico. And how do I do that? You have to condemn his actions. Okay. I will. Eismann trained there, too. He was famous in South Leipzig. In all of Leipzig. He'd beaten all comers. He was the standard to live up to. He didn't speak much. And to us not at all. He looked short on humour. But maybe he didn't need it. You need to work. Or you'll have no wind and lose back the gains you've made. You need courage to move in and fear to stay out when that's wise. You can make it. You've got what it takes. And no street fighting. Paul could open car doors. But only French ones, which was the downside to his method. But Original Leipzig Premium Pils turned every car into a flying machine. Like a sort of blonde bottle-genie, that took us gently by the hair, carried us over walls, and was the magic carpet from which we could spit down on cops' heads. More! More! More! Drive, you asshole! We are the greatest! Brothers! Where have we risen from? - From the ruins! The ruins! THUNDERSTORM IN THE BRAIN Until next time, friends. We're good, thanks. How is this going to work? How did you advertise? - Lots of word-of-mouth. Always mentioned DJ Frog. In this shitty area? - That's the thing. The hall is "underground", The way here, too. Guys, DJ Frog. Here we are. I don't remember whose idea the disco was. Maybe Mark's. Or Rico's. I sometimes think it was my idea, but... somehow I know that's not true. Only the name was mine: "The Eastside". Two belt-driven HTEs From the Slit-eyes. But good as new. I'd have preferred Technics, but they're 600 apiece. That's the deposit for returning 200 nicked beer crates. I get 200 upfront. Yes. A beer? I'd prefer coffee. - We don't have it. We're working on it. Then a Coke for the ladies. Paul, would you get the girls three Cokes? Thanks. Again. Enjoy. - For us two. A beer, please. - Order down there. A beer, please. - Another beer. A beer! - One-fifty, please. Cheers. - Thanks. Hey. Won't let us in again? Whoever pays is welcome. Speckled jacket showed up on the first night. He called himself "Snow Leopard". Most people called him "Bird Shit". Listen, muscleman. You have too few girls here. You can bring some along. We could get some friends. But free admission. That's out. Then give us back our money. We are business men. Shit! Shit! What's this? What a shit joint! Nazi pigs! Don't get a shock. - I won't. My dad is an electrician. There we go. Another Coke? - Nah. You can't just sell beer and Coke. People want a drink. Here. My fee. I won't take your money. You have none. The joint is too dark. It's depressing. It's underground. Good luck. Here. Frog's big now. He's just forgotten what's underground. But why were there so few girls? Does anyone get it? We're going to be the greatest. Then the girls will turn up. We appoint you... Chief Representative of Bar Affairs. I like it. - Above all responsible for the Eastside Special Cocktails. White and brown schnapps, OJ and Jägermeister. Brown and white schnapps, cherry juice and bubbly. Or just white and Coke. With a slice. Why's that? - It looks good. For the broads, Dani. Wait, I'll compare them again. Honestly... they're all top quality. For a while I drank pils with herb liqueur. What? - That tastes shit, Thilo. It was just a suggestion. Come along and check it out. Hello. - Hello. Hello. - Hello. Good to see you. - Me too. To see you, I mean. Wednesday or Saturday, too? - Wednesday. I'll come back for Saturday. Do you have lucky numbers? - They're my mother's numbers. You have to play your own numbers. I'm just keeping my mate company. - Okay. Here. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Ciao. -Bye. Well, what do you say? No big deal, I'd say. So what's with the hand? And the eye contact? It's her eyes. The almond-eye number. Don't take it literally. She's a Slit-eye. - She's from the West. But a Slit-eye. - A West one. You can tell by her accent. LOTTO FAIRY I took her out. To a café with tablecloths. To drink wine. I ordered and paid. No one was surprised at the pair of us. But she said she's 28. Too old for me. It's no use, she said to me. Older's good, Paul. She'll show you the ropes! Don't piss on our house or I'll catch it. Yeah! - Little slut! Goddamn West-slut! Paul, dear... It's broads. They screw you about! She doesn't have a boyfriend. - How do you know? By the way she touched my hand. If she has a boyfriend, a real Slit-eye, he'll chop off your prick with a samurai sword. We're good together. I'm not too young for her. And I love her. I've got to go home. Mama says I'm becoming a crook. - She's right! Drink her off your mind, Paul! What's wrong now? - Are you stupid? The whole house is shaking. Let me explain, Papa. It's a techno club. We're practising... This is work. These are all my friends. We are disco proprietors! Get lost. You're coming upstairs. He's our Pitbull. Piss off! Leave our Pitbull be, get it? The door's over there. Don't touch him! Was I doing anything? Huh? The boy's out of it. Show some sense. Shit. He's my father. Where's Paul gone? Cheers, Dani. Shit. The cops! I love her... Easy. Hey, my brother. Our friend the People's Policeman Who always means well by us Friendship! - Friendship! Get up, the People's Police are here. - I love her! Don't touch me. - Pipe down! Cool it. Take the sodding cuffs off. I'm home here. Who's there? - Police. Are you Mrs Lenz? Yes. - Is this your son? Yes. - Congratulations. I did nothing. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? - Stop! It's always the same! - Stop! Why are you like this? Why don't you spare me a thought? Why is the police bringing you home? I can explain but it's complicated. The cops misunderstood things. And now your lies to top it all. You're my cross, just like your father was. You and your filth! I go to the fish factory for your sake. I stink of fish, even after showering for half an hour. And what do you do? I often dream about those days even now. Though it didn't last even a year. The year of The Eastside. As if it were the longest era of my youth. Or were we still children? I don't know how come our joint took off. Maybe word got out we were the youngest disco proprietors in Crottendorf or in Leipzig. Or in all Germany. It was underground, in a word. It's a fiver each. - We though it's free admission. For you it is. Thanks. - Thanks. Well? - For you it's not. Thanks. - Pleasure. It's come true. We are the greatest! You said it, Rico. How did you know? Because we're brothers. Back of the queue! - Shut it! Come over here. - You come here. There's eleven of us. Booze up the rest. Hey! - Shut it, huh? We're on the guest list. Shut it you wanker! I want to talk to your boss. - We don't have one. You can talk to me. - I'm looking for a guy known as Pitbull. He's over there. The big guy? - Yes. I'm Kehlmann. Pleased to meet you. It's like this: make all the noise you want here but the market is ours. I don't follow. - I'll put it like this: You're a big and handsome boy and you want to stay one. They say you have a boxer. - He's outside. Rico. I'll speak to him, too. Hey! What brings you here? I tagged along. I thought we'd go out sometime. I asked Fred about you. He didn't know where you are or wouldn't tell me. I didn't see him again. Nor did I. He left for Berlin. Good to hear. You'll stay till closing, right? What do you want with her, you tosser? - You're the tosser. I'll kill you, Shithead! Rico. On the house. Come on! Move it. It was just an alarm pistol. It would have done the trick, Rico... So close to the head. They want to take over our club, Dani. Listen... The birds. Shit, Rico. They'll do us in. - Shut it. Up to Dani's! Stay where you are! Dani, where are you? Open up! - Dani! Bust the door down! - Get them! Get them! Kneel down! Get up, asshole! - I've had enough! I'm sorry! You surrender, huh? Aren't you a boxer, huh? You're a coward, not a boxer if you surrender. Say please! I can't hear you. Please. Please stop! Let's go, boys. Asshole! Dani? Shit! What are you doing here, what happened? Who did this? Dani, why was your fucking door locked? Why didn't you call out? I'd have come down with my Kalashnikov bayonet. There were too many of them. It wouldn't have helped. They all work for Kehlmann. Watch out, Dani. He's out for you because of the girl. Stay clear of her. They've all fucked her, anyway. That's not true. - Shit! How am I to go to school now? - You're not. Niklas, keep your guard up. - Rico's glad when you come. Why should he be? - Because everyone treats him unfairly. Two rounds and I'm done. - Okay. Go on, Rico, jab. Punch. He wanted to set fire to the headmaster's flat. Just a bit. To bug him. If he repeats the year, what will become of him? It'd be pure loneliness. - He can still be a good athlete. I didn't really defend him. I always liked you, Dani. I liked you, too. I have to speak to you. To you alone. I'll only tell you. I'm leaving. What does that mean? - Well, that I'm leaving here. As my parents are leaving. You can't just run off. - I can. You wanted to establish socialism. - Yes. No one wanted socialism as much as you. - Yes. If you go to the West, we might never see each other again. I'll remember your face. Forever. Oh, Dani! We're supposed to help you. Then get the other wall. Be ready! - I recognised you both at once. Mark Bormann and Daniel Lenz. You won the poetry-recital competition. It was beautifully done. Young pioneers are always prepared. Are you still at school, boys? And just earning on the side? We're doing 20 hours on the side. For criminal damage. You see? Order must prevail! But you damaged socialism, too. I mean the socialistic cause. It says in the paper that was you. And the Party you're in. That I was in. Paint from top to bottom. You still know best about everything? Dani, come here. You come here. Look who it is. No, come here. It's important. What's up, mate? Dani, I need a huge favour. Kehlmann's guys got me. They know you're here. I promised you'd come out. I have to play along or they'll do me in. They have to see I'm playing along, get it? So we step outside, you run for it. Dani, my brother. We'll make them pay. I have connections. But it'll take time. Yes. - Forget the knife. It won't help here. They have a car. You can split over the tracks. Sure. Run, Dani! You're dead! You wanker! GUTTER HOUND Come on! What are you doing here? Well, what are you doing here? Hanging around though you don't live here! I can't go down right now. Some guys want to beat me up. They stole my money. My mother reported them. They're waiting at school to break my bones. They're older than me. How old are you then? - Sixteen. Come in for a second. We can look down to see if they're still there. But take your shoes off. My husband's due in soon. I'll be leaving in a minute. Shall we check if they're there? That's them. Want a drink? Yes. That'd be great. You're a nice boy. Come here. I'm sorry. A quick one? Chalk it up to Rico. Shit! We'll get you! Come here! Half of you that way! Throw down the bar or we kill you dead. You asshole! Look at me when I'm talking! Look, the boy is afraid. You're the greatest, you asshole. Up you get! Don't fall asleep now. Want another chance, fighter? - Come on, finish him off! Please stop! I've had enough. You poor thing! Poor Dani. My poor little gutter hound. Why? Why, fuck it? It's all right, I'm here. Enough, babe. Let's go. Why are you with that ass? Screw him! We'll finish him off. - Shh. I promise you. They're killing us. And you? You owe your life to her. Shut the door. Go on! Now I'll take your blood pressure. Talking hurts. You don't have to tell me anything. I wanted to set off the alarm. It would have saved me. It didn't work. Though every car alarm always works. You've been lucky, Dani. Kehlmann is just too strong. I think we'll have to speak to him. Thilo says you got into his car. I wanted to know if he'd negotiate. - Negotiate what? He wants our club so as to sell his shit there. We can get some guys, go round and really twist their balls off, know what I mean? Pussy! ALWAYS READY My pride is my red scarf, look here you and see! I am honoured to wear it, it suits to a T Like the rose's blossom in the summer does shine Radiant as spring flowers is this scarf of mine It's something I wear wherever I am It's red as the flag that strengthens the land And why do I wear it? I'll tell you right here I wear it for peace For I'm a pioneer You will know that meetings are being held in our city these days. People marching and endangering our socialistic order and security. You will also know that participating in such marches is forbidden. Because they irresponsibly jeopardise our achievements as well as our order and security. That's what they want. Their goal is... You know the pedestrian bridge near the department store. During meetings and marches, this bridge is being crossed by hundreds or thousands of people shouting out slogans and jumping up and down to provoke our People's Police. The bridge... could collapse. You can imagine there'd be injuries and deaths, too. This is just one of the ways these troublemakers and rioters are acting irresponsibly. Pioneers, stand up! We end this meeting with the greeting of the Thälmann Pioneers: For freedom and socialism, be ready! - Always ready! Hi, Dani. I need your advice, Werner. - I heard what happened. I know a few red skins, maybe they can help. You'd need an appointment, but they're glad to help. They're the toughest. They don't fight, they rumble. - What's the difference? You might be missing fingers afterwards. They take them with them. A beer for now. The bastards are ruining everything for us. If you don't understand something in this world, it's a money matter. Dough, greens, readies! It's like war. You don't understand it and it's about money. How is Rico's boxing? I hear he's good. Yes, everyone says so. Got a smoke? Got another? Sure. - Hey. You're so nice I'll draw you a picture. - Forget it. No, sure, mate. The guy didn't come back from some LSD trip or another. He's gone for good. That circle here is us. And the other circles? I haven't a clue. Have a seat. Thanks. Don't be like the others. I'm not. Give up on all this shit. I will. I need someone who's always there for me, Dani. I would tell you I love you, but it's not my style. Then don't. This might just be a turn of phrase. And it's stupid if I say it and you don't believe me. My Mama is often out. So we can screw a bit there if that doesn't offend. We're that age, after all. Take me somewhere, Dani. I will. I have to stay here till A-levels. It sounds stupid... but I promised my mother. I am bad and you are good, Dani. You're my dream. We could ride the tram all day. With a day ticket and a crate of beer. I've wanted that for a long time. I'll show you something that belongs to you alone. ZEITHAIN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY It's just the way it goes. It's not so bad, you got two years on probation, but you're doing four weeks' now. You have to leave today. And I hope I never see you again. - I promise. Honest. What matters is you don't miss too much at school. You saw what happened to Rico. Rico is fine. You wanted to become a reporter. Or is that over? No. We left lots of your questions unanswered back then... even though they were justified. Without which there'd have been no deaths at the Wall. The accused may not have wanted to kill, but they expected it and took it on board, knowing they wouldn't be held accountable in the GDR. You enjoy this, right? Smashing a shop window is fun for you. No... No, Mama, that's not true. Were also prisoners of post-WWII history. Without the Cold War the border would have been completely different. Criminal Court no. 27's sentence was more lenient... A carton. You well today? - Well today. Hey, are you nuts? You can't just climb in here. Oh, four weeks' youth detention. You got it. If you'd just stand. Don't lean. Fine... I'll lock away your carton, you can consume a packet a day. Get undressed. Jacket, trousers, pullover, shoes. Pants. Take your pants off. Get on with it. Pants down. If that's what you like. Bend over. Further forwards. All right. You can stand up. Good night. Understand! I don't want to be alone anymore. You won't be when I get out. I have to rethink it all. Rethink what? Everything. Mr Lenz, your time is up. It's all good, Starlet. Thilo still talks of our great counter-attack. But there never was one. The red skins didn't come. They said Kehlmann's not a real Nazi. They didn't care that he was an asshole. My regards to the asses. Cheers! Bye, good luck. - Bye. How did you know I'm getting out? I met your mother, she told me. Ah! Your mother still lends you her car? - To stop me nicking them... and becoming a crook. How are thing with the broads? Perverse as always. I brought you a mag. I might start selling them. Or videos. It's easy money, you know? I thought up a name for myself, Porno Paul. It sounds good because of the two "P"s. With this you can make calls anywhere. Interesting. Park up. It works on the move. - I need to concentrate. Stop. I can't go with women, Dani. Since Slit-eyes. If I was only gay. But that doesn't work, either. Hello. I'd like to speak to Starlet. THE BIG DIPPER Okay? - Okay. Not bad. - Wicked. Welcome home. Well? How was it inside? It's not too bad. It's like a holiday camp... but short on space. Look, the Big Dipper. Yes. Some stars form a "K" for cunt. Mark, it's spelled with a Who gives a fuck? There are cunts everywhere up there. It depends on your imagination. My thoughts are elsewhere. I know where they are. With that little pussy. She's gone, moved districts. You've got to forget her. She'll mess you up, she's crazy. She only holds out on you. - Starlet isn't a pussy! Did she put out for you? I didn't ask because you're my friend. - Shut your gob. Maybe others did. - Just shut your gob. Change of topic. Do you believe in the meaning of life? Listen, Dani. Our song. There is a skylight back there. Mark, I think they've gone. We can climb down the tree. You afraid? - Never. I'm on probation! It's not high up, Dani. I can hang from the ladder and jump. Mark? Mark! All safe and sound, Dani. Same as ever. There's shit on them. - Sorry. Then get the other foot. Now drop... - Okay. Thanks. Shit! Are there any windows? Only those up there. Great. How do we get out? Somehow. We always do. Shit, Mark! Come here! - Asshole. What's that? Dani, I don't believe it! Dani, it's a real computer monitor. There are more of them. Don't sit on it. They're really fragile. All right, all right. - You know what? We take them and we flog them. No trouble. One, two, three... - Shit, Mark. Check out the stickers. Defective. They all are. Maybe it's not true. - Why shouldn't it be? Because they're trying to do us down. Sure thing. Hello there! Luck is the thing. I've had it with school. My parents don't know. I leave my stuff at Thilo's. He's always in. They'll find out sooner or later. I'll move out. Live by making music. It was always my dream. We'll re-open The Eastside. We'll get it running, right Dani? Sure. And we'll twist Kehlmann's balls off. You're my brother, Dani. Look. I got this for myself for the weekend. From Pitbull. At a discount. Let's share it. Since it's a nice evening. Half each. It'll be mad. Or are you staying clean? No. The mad colours! - Yes. The mad colours. Pass it. I'll split it. I've got it. - Here. Your hands are trembling. Give it to me. - Careful. What the fuck? - I don't want us to take it! The guy Pitbull got it off has moved on to heroin! So what? I'm not! Yet. It's okay, Dani. You mean well. Says if you break something that's broken, is it criminal damage? Beserker! THE BIG FIGHTS Two beers, two giggle-juices. - To warm us. Never enter the ring cold. Gentleman will do it again! - Henry will win! Screw Gentleman! They only like him because he's from the East. He's a ladies man. - Come off it, Dani! Rocky's a ladies man. He fought his way up from the bottom. You can tell. That's what ladies like. - Okay. Like that. Then he'll get the title. Turn it up, Goldie! I liked boxing. I know, Rico. I know. The middleweight fight between Rico Grundmann... and Steffen... Eismann! If you ask me, he's letting Rocchigiani in too close. Go in, Rocky! Go in! He's scared, he'll miss! Yes, beautiful! That's the way! Maske is in trouble with Rocchigiani, there's no mistaking it. Anyone who thought he was easy pickings was mistaken. - Like Eismann back then. You were just incautious. Yes. Unfortunately. Watch out, Rico. Don't always use your left the same way. Right? And don't drop your guard after a punch. Breathe deeply now. Rocchigiani is slackening. He doesn't have the strength... Listen to this rubbish. Rocchigiani punches harder, this ass doesn't get it. Right. Finish him off! Maske can't escape. - Go on, Rocky! Keep at it! Maske is pretty impressed, not to say flagging. Watch out, Henry, please! You see, Dani! Only Rocky's landing them. - Yes! Even the dumb commentator can tell! - He might go down now. Break it up! Can he survive this crisis? Kick his western ass, Henry! Who'd have thought it? Listen to me, Rico. Are you listening? Show me what you're made of. Show you're hard and can fight. You hear me? He's finished. Let him know he is. Make him feel it. Don't wait around. Hit him first. You've got big plans, kid! Now off you march! Scheiss-mann! Scheiss-mann! Finish him! One, two, three... Four... Five... Six... Get up Get up! He's counting! Get up! Eight... Get up, Rico! - Nine... and out! He's standing! He's still standing! Henry... Maske. Hey, what are you doing? Are you mad? It was the time of big fights. And Rico... lost all of his. RAYS Dani, say... - Yes. Suddenly you'd all left. There was no one there to tell me: Mark, don't do it. No one. No one took care of me. Why weren't you there? - Stop with that shit. Why didn't you visit me? - Man! Mark, please, this is going nowhere. Just go back to the clinic. You can make it. I can't. - How's your arm? It's better. I'm using my leg now. I'm so fucked, Dani. So fucked. No you're not. Remember how beautiful Katja was? Or how we tried to piss over the partition into the girl's loo? No one ever managed that. No one. Except you. Or how we fought for peace together. You wanted to give me your belly-shot. And Pitbull wasn't a fucking dealer yet. And Rico was the greatest boxer. He'll be it again. He'll devour them all. No matter what happened. He was top. We'll be the greatest again. We'll re-open The Eastside. And we'll mow down Kehlmann's guys. You have to be there, Mark. We're brothers, aren't we? Mark, say something! Where are you? Three handfuls of earth or one? Three is better. IN ETERNAL REMEMBERANCE, YOUR FRIENDS Great parking space. You know the place. Yes, well... I have to make coffee, lay the table... Anke! - Yes. Anke! - What is it? Get glasses for the boys. I thought he'd sold this stuff. No. He wanted to practice again once he'd got clean. He wanted to get clean one day. Let's go. - Another minute. We'll never see Mark's room again. That's going too far, Paul. - It smells like Mark did. It's his funny deodorant. Right. It smells like Mark. That's him. Sit down. No one else will be coming now. We have to drink a toast to our boy. You're all on these. We've got a microwave, now. Come up, I'll show you. It works with rays. - I can't wait. They're rare. Especially in the East. My father bought it at once. Pretty big for a micro-wave. It has to be. So a pizza or a chicken fits inside. And this light is where the rays are. Put something inside. Okay. My mother hasn't gone shopping. But we can take this egg. And what will it turn into? A boiled egg, I guess. One boiled by rays. Does your dad still have the mags? - Yeah. I can get them anytime I know where they are. I mean the blonde who spreads her legs so wide. Did you know it's that pink inside? Shit. They're gone. They were under "Football Weekly". What about your mother's side? My mother doesn't have things like that. Don't you think it's ready? That's what the rays do! Three more doubles. Sure. - Thanks. Order four. Not three but four. Four doubles. - Okay. It's what people do. It's for Mark. As if he were here. Sadly he's not. And what if he wants a beer, too? - There's nothing he wants anymore. No, Paul's right. He'll need a beer. Same as ever. Goldie, another beer. - Coming up. Goldie, over here. - Coming. Thanks. Cut the crap. I'm thinking of Mark. - Right. You always thought of him. As you sold him stuff. You mustn't talk like that, Dani. Why did you do it? What do you mean? What is this? He was my friend, Dani. My brother. Like you. Let's play... a round for Mark. In his honour. Only if you quit it. The last time I played a round with Mark... he was so out of it he could hardly hit a ball. Dani, leave it. You know where he went next? He went to yours, Pitbull. To get fresh supplies. - Stop it, Dani. You said you'd stop. But last month... you really didn't need to do it. He was in a bad state already. He'd been in hospital. You knew that. I didn't know he was shooting up, Dani. Honest. He really begged me. And he could have gone elsewhere, you know that. He'd have got it elsewhere. Maybe not. Nobody knows if it was my stuff that did him in. You hear me, Dani? Nobody knows. Leave him be, Dani. It's your turn. But you shouldn't have done that to Mark. Piss off! I didn't make him die. PARTING Are you such a joy to your gran, too? One of them is dead, the other lives in Jüterbog. Will you eat with us? - Gladly. It was even in the paper. It wasn't my fault. What happened? Someone was meant to turn off the alarm. They failed. My mistake was being there at all. So where are you going now? - They'll find me. I'm on their files. I'll have been seen in the bank or caught on camera. They'd even find me here. I won't open up. I'll say you're not here. It tastes great. Fucking shame I couldn't come to Mark's burial. We sent your regards. I'll make my peace, Dani, even if it takes years. But not today. Today we go show the broads a thing or two. If the bank-job had worked out, I'd have done my driving license and bought a car. Completely legal. Legal at last, Dani! - Yeah! I'm turning myself in. Does she get completely undressed? - Must do. I thought you'd been here - Paul has. Now for the exotic jungle queen, Li Dong. She's really lonely. You can tell. Take pleasure, as I do, in youthful Carmen. Here for her fifth time. She celebrated her 18th birthday last week. Give me a smoke. Unbelievable, it's Starlet. You used to be hot for her! Quit it, Rico. Finally you get to see her naked. - Stop it. She's 18? She was younger than us. Give me a light. It's on me. Everyone said you'd left. I did. But now I'm back. I always liked dance. Here I can develop on it. It's more of an art-thing. Kind of. Not like the others! You can see that for yourselves. The money is good and it's fun. I always liked dancing. And I think you have your own style. I'm glad to hear it. It's nice to see you both again. Seeing you here reminds me of old times, Starlet. "Starlet." No one has called me that in ages. That's Ramona. She had her tits done. Think they're sexy, those big meat-boobies? Hmm, with you everything is real. Starlet, want a whisky? Sure. You know me. I'll get three. On my tab. But with Coke, Dani. I have to take care. - Right. Yes, Rico. You see? Stop it. Don't touch me, Rico. - Hey! Stop it! It's just touching. - I'll run out! Rico! - Hey... Don't be like that. It's all right. All right. I'm sorry. Hey, come here. Stop crying. Have a bit more. It's good stuff. Right from the source. A bit more. You see? It's all fine. Right? We have to go out or Dani will notice. You and your Dani. Where've you been? I have to go home. Enough dancing. - Sleep well. It's good for you. You'll come back, right? You can stop up there. We're there. Tell my gran what's up, okay. The best is yet to come, Rico. There's never a night I don't dream about all this. And the memories dance around every day. I know a nursery rhyme. I hum it to myself when everything goes crazy in my mind. Where to?
