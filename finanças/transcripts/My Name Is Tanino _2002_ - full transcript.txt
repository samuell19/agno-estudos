Dear Giuseppe, you must be surprised to hear from your best friend. I hope you still consider me that, after so much time. Where should I begin to tell you of my adventures? I want to tell you every incredible event that brought me here. Perhaps you won't believe me, but I was almost killed. First, by an American bullet, then by an American Truck. Then I became successful, in the American way. I was then chased like a hero in an action film. I could go on, up to yesterday's encounter with a very special person. I won't say who right now, to keep you in suspense. I'll just say that tomorrow I'll realize my lifelong dream. Here in New York, where I always wanted to come... even though you were against it. But anyhow... I'm so emotional. I want to tell you everything from the beginning. It was last summer in Castelluzzo. You were there too. We were in our usual place, discussing politics. The Seattle protests have put a thorn in the side of the globalists. The war's over, comrades! - Fuck off! - Ignore them. - Russomanno! - What? Bite me! Did you understand the importance of the "Three days of Catania"? Sure. It sends a strong message against The IMF, and it's about time! Yeah! We can't support a leftist government with so many corrupt deputies. You're not listening. You're watching the girls. - Me? - What did I say? That the leftist government doesn't represent us. Not just that, Tanino. Globalisation is taking over, and we don't fight it. - Who, You and me? - All of us! Take the Single European Currency. Yeah, that's a good thing. Idiot! It's not good. It's crap! I know, but you're confusing me. And the multinationals with their genetically modified crops! "Three days of Catania" will fight this. - Did she lose something? - We've all lost something. But we haven't lost the will to fight. Where are you going? I see it! Thanks a lot! You're welcome! Look at his eyes! They're beautiful! - What? - You have beautiful eyes. Thanks. - What is your name? - I'm Sally. My name is Tanino. - That's pathetic! - What did I do? - The classic move by the Italian male! - I just helped her! The gentleman bit! Are we still there? They're looking at us! - Hello! - What are you doing? - Saying, Hi. - How embarrassing! Hi! Me and my friend, Melissa, are going out for pizza tonight. Want to join us? A Pizza together, we and you? Do You know the pizzeria in town? - The one in public square? - That's the only pizzeria! - They invited us for pizza. - We can't go! - Why not? - The train for Catania leaves at 9:15. That's True! Excuse me, a little problem! We have the "Three days of Catania". Definitive! - So you can't? - I am sorry. Okay, Let's get going. - Isn't he funny? - Yeah. Ciao! - What did she say? - "Funny". What's that mean? "Ridiculous". Personally, I agree. Is Tanino really studying film at the University in Rome? - Yes, "Science and Communication". - "OF Communication", Mom. Show-biz is fascinating. My cousin knows someone at RAI. His wife works in advertising. Why don't I introduce you, Tanino. He's not interested in TV. He likes the movie starlets! Why doesn't he make a film here? He can put us in it. Yes, "Vacation in Castelluzzo!" - Mainstream cinema doesn't interest him. - What does he like? He likes intellectual films, only from certain countries. Mom, Be quiet! - Which countries? - Iran, Iraq... Tanino, you tell her! It's burning! Why do I have this cabbage hair? - Fresh juice? - No, Mr. Basilio. Then I'll drink it. Mom, where's Dad's shirt? It's in the dresser! - I don't like Basilio. - Why? - He seems gay. - But he's married. - Where's his wife? - She's dead. - Did he kill her? - Are You crazy? - Giuseppe's here. - Make an excuse! - Are you ill? Are you in Rome? - He knows I'm here. Hi, Giuseppe! Tanino isn't here. He had to meet with his cousins. But the train is leaving! You go ahead! He'll go later. - How? - With his cousins. Ciao, Giuseppe! My cousins are 1 year old, the other 6 months! Giuseppe, Excuse me for doing that to you and to our friendship. I still wonder what specifically attracted me so much to Sally. She was kind, honest, and down to earth. Perhaps it was my destiny calling, and I didn't know it. Are those your friends? Never seen them! For those three days, we were inseparable. Unfortunately, her friend was inseparable too. - Say Hello to America. - "Hello to America". The light gives me a sense of obscurity. Sally studied Sicilian painters of the past. She knows everything. More than me, and I was born in Sicily. She's not an expert on political issues, like the identity crisis of the left, or conflicts of interest, but she learns what she studies. This is so boring! Let's go to the beach, Please! Come on, Chop, Chop, Chop! Andiamo! Here's Miss Sally Garfield, direct from the USA. Enough, Tanino! You come from Seaport, in the state of... How's it called? Rhode lsland! Why did you come to Castelluzzo? Say what the Italians in Seaport said! In Seaport there are many Sicilians. The mayor is Sicilian. He's from Campania. "Campanaro"? But he's not very nice. He's kind of mafioso! Many Sicilians in my city are from Castelluzzo. They say, "Go visit Castelluzzo!" And so, Here I am! But Castelluzzo isn't so beautiful. Taormina and Siracusa are beautiful, but Castelluzzo is so-so. It's ugly! - You are so funny! - You always say I'm funny. That's not good! May I? Come on in! The water is great! Come on, Sally! After spending so much time together, just before she went home, we were able to explore our relationship objectively, because we had become more than just friends. The Description Of A Moment the convictions that change and collapse the fortress of my weakness. You're no longer alone 'cause you don't want to be alone and believe that sharing your life is normal. But my memory slips, I remember slightly sending thoughts. Feeling that in a moment, whatever we thought... could happen. And then what happened? Did we wait or forget. Now we see each other... after almost 5 years. And it's always that description of a moment. A video camera! Good for video replays. Thanks. ROME Three Months Later So, What is love for me? Sincerity, Trust... How do you say, Physical Attraction? Piaciamento Fisico? It's like that. Let's speak English now! What do you think of me? You're very nice. How do you say, "I'll miss you"? He's always watching the American girl! You'll become blind! We want to watch the game, Fiorentina - Bari. - Go Bari! - Bari made a goal! He ate all mom's cookies! - Everything! - And Uncle's tomato sauce! What did you say? DIALECT - Sicilian, Open your ears! - I'm sick of you! - Go back to Sicily! - Southerner! I was here first! DIALECT Damn Puglies! I can't study anymore. Who Is Chinawsky? Personally I believe he's one of the best directors alive. He lives in New York. He's one of the most important directors in the world. My friend thinks the same. Russomanno Giuseppe. You know him? His films are bitter yet provocative, A refuge from indulgence. - What was it? - A refuge from indulgence. Okay! A refuge from indulgence! Sorry, but... Are you okay? No, I couldn't sleep last night because I live with an awful group of Puglies! - A group? - Of Puglies! I understand. Do you want some water? Thanks! This exam is very important for me. - Military Service? - You read my mind. Tell me one thing that goes along with the theme of this course. - One thing? - An Italian film from the 60's. - They are many! - Give me one title. - Can I say one from Fellini? - Yes! The White Ship... On The Road. What was it? Professor, I've drawn a blank. It's a film that has a number for its title. Understand? Sure, I think it's "12", no? 12 and something. Giuseppe, you know what happens when I get in trouble. I lose my senses and forget where I am. It's like my soul leaves my body and goes somewhere happier. Far away and unattainable. Tanino, Your bite hurts your mother. But you've drunk my milk, and you've grown tall! You've become very tall! Dad! - What happened? - I'll tell you. Do you have a cigarette? Don't worry, Tanino! Wait Dad! I have so many questions. Momma! Mom! - You're here early? - 30 with honors. I was resting. Are you hungry? There's eggplant in the oven. Or do you want pasta? I made meatballs. Why are you early? What about your exam? I told you, 30 with honors. Is someone here? It broke, but maybe you can fix it. It's not important. - I hurt myself. - Basilio, Tanino has a surprise. - He got 30 with honors. - Excellent! My compliments! Stop playing ball at night! I can't sleep! - Am I bothering you? - Yes. I wanted to show you this. - What is it? - My Cousin works in the Military Office. It's a list of the guys being called to military service. You're on the list. But you passed your exam. You can get an exemption. - It's all under control. - Well... If you have any problems, we can work something out. - Your mother doesn't need to know. - Leave her alone! I understand your hostility is driven by psychological reasons. But you are a modern boy. You must have sympathy for two lonely hearts... who have found happiness together. Why deny it? - What? - Me and your mother, Tanino! Don't touch me! I hardly know you. We'll get to know each other. We'll learn to help each other. Don't deny this opportunity! Nothing's worse than a Winter's Sunday in Castelluzzo, than when you realize, that your life stinks. And that you're not worth anything, not to yourself, nor to others. Nothing is worse! The only person who could help me was my old friend, Giuseppe. In fact, the following Monday I went looking for you at work. How can I help? I don't want to be a soldier. They'll put me in Kosovo. There's no sea there! You don't get the phone? Get the phone! DIALECT - What if I escape? - Where to? - To the U.S. - Are you crazy? I know you don't like The U.S., but I promised Sally I'd find her. Who? The American girl from last Summer. - And the airfare? - I can go on a ship, and uh... - Give me some advice! - What can I say? Castelluzzo has a great mystery. I trust your confidentiality 100%. But Castelluzzo has a mysterious comunicative power... that makes the internet look slow! There's the guy going to America! Okay, Okay, Okay! - Say Hi to Pamela Anderson! - Who? Tanino, Make us proud in America! Forza Castelluzzo! We drink this wine to the honor of Tanino... I've been looking for you! Did I hurt you? - Are you Tanino, who's going to America? - What do you want? - Li Causi Franco. Please follow me. - Why? Please! This crappy country and job! You're smart to go to America. The others just talk about going. My brother Angelo moved there 20 years ago. He has it good there in Seaport. He's got a big house with 5 baths! I can't go because of my health. - To Seaport? - Yes. See those bags? They have to go to Seaport. Here's your plane ticket. You go in my place, instead of taking the long boat trip. That's for Leonardo DiCaprio! It seemed like a spy film, a bit Italian comedy. Now I realize it wasn't only Providence that sent me to America. I didn't know it then, but I was set on traveling. I kept going over the email I sent to Sally, announcing my surprise visit. I kept reading her reply, but it was very vague. I thought maybe I wouldn't go. But destiny decided for me. I left at night, just like an adventure novel. Mom, I'm leaving for America. Don't know when I'll be back. I'll write when I can, Your son, Tanino Did you see last night's game? - Go! - Is it Okay? Thanks! Thanks a lot! I was met by the Li Causi family. Mr. Angelo, his wife Santa, 3 Rosario's, Vito. It was Castelluzzo overseas. I'll introduce you to all the Italians! We'll give you a good welcome. There's many young people: Cousins Salvo, Dino, Pippo, Pino! Sebastiano, Aunt Rosa, Rosina, Rosetta... - Hey, I'm talking here! - You didn't say my parents. They're not from Castelluzzo! - Do you like people from Ragusa? - What? - He's great! - Oh yes! - Make yourself confortable. - Are you tired? Are you hungry? I'll fix you something at home. What the fuck you doing? You gonna break everything! No problem! The first days, stay home and rest! You can eat at home or in our restaurants. Give him the map! - How many maps you give him? - I don't know! - How's Italy? - Well, it's... Di Pietro is in jail. The Communists have taken over. But Berlusconi will get them, kick their ass! Am I right, Tanino? - Where is Green Hill? - Why do you want go there? I need to bring someone something. - A girl? - An American girl? American girls can't cook, and they divorce! Some asshole lawyer makes you pay alimony. Up to $100,000 a year! So don't get any ideas! Because I want you to go back and kick the Ragusas ass! Son of a Bitch! Look at those dummies! The guys are throwing a welcome party for you at the club. They'll love you! Okay, where's Green Hill? Still this Green Hill! It's all old houses. There's no shopping malls, no McDonald's! Is it far from your house? It's the other side of town, by the University. We'll bring her the thing for you. - Where are you going? - Thanks, I'll call you! Is he crazy? Hello, I am Tanino, the friend of Sally. I am Italian boy, Friend of Sally Garfield. Is she here? Speak English? Goodbye! Oh my God! I can't believe it! I brought you this. My camera! It doesn't matter, my father has another. Anyway, Thank You. Can I give you a kiss? It's incredible to be here in this famous America. - Where are you staying? - I came to find you. I sent you an eletronic post - an E-mail! Oh my God! Wait a minute! They're crazy in this country! What the hell! Leave him alone! I'm so sorry! Cuba just wants to play. Are you alright? Cuba wanted to play. This is my mother. - Nice to meet you! - My name is Tanino. Is this your first time in The U.S.? First time? Yes, the first time. Hey, Easy! He looks like Aladdin! Can I play with him? Honey, Let him go! - Say you're sorry! - No! No problem for me. Daddy! Good Morning, my little princess! - Did you sleep well? - Yes, Daddy. - Did you make your bed? - Yes, Daddy. Good girl! And here's my big princess as well. Good Morning! Morning, Daddy. - Did you sleep well? - Yes, and I made my bed. Good girls! Who's going to introduce our guest to me? Good Morning, I take the video camera to Sally's home. He's a friend of Sally's from Italy. His name is Tanino. Welcome, Tanino! Nice to meet you, Mr. Garfield. - So, Tony... - Tanino. Taniño, is this your first time in The United States? Yes, first time. How do you like it here? Did he ask if I like? Yes, it's very beautiful, but cold! Not here! Here you have heating. But ouside, cold! He looks like Aladdin! - Stop bothering him! - Cut it out, Jane! Thanks! What part of Italy do you come from? He's from Sicily, but he studies in Rome. - Rome! - How beautiful! Yes, it is! A little traffic, but very interesting. It's the capital of Italy, you know. Sure. Do you go to University there? Yes, University. How do you say, Lettere? Liberal Arts. - Interesting! - Yes, very. What are your job prospects? How do you plan to use your Liberal Arts degree? - He asked what job you'll get. - Oh me, what job? I like "Regia", but I'm not sure. - "Regia"? - Yes. "Regia" What's Regia, cheese? It's how you say, Direction. Oh, Direction. Direction, honey. That's wonderful! What kind of direction? This is the question indeed. Is he staying with us? I guess so. I didn't expect him to come! Don't be rude. He's come to see you. Please, Let's keep him. He's so cute! I would like to know exactly what your plans are for your trip. What are your travel plans? - What I plan to do here? - Exactly! Exactly, I don't know! I'll look around. I'll play it by ear. "Who lives, will see" as we say back home. Honey, I gotta go. At least where I'm from. It's beautiful here! - Make your bed! - Sure. In such a friendly climate between two cultures, only Sally was hostile. Uncle Michael was her father's brother and partner. "Garfield & Garfield" law firm. He made small talk with me. Americans like this kind of talk. Is this your first time in The U.S.? Yes, and it's cold outside. But here is okay. I go to University in Roma, the capital of Italy. A little traffic, but wonderful. Great! Michael, we have to go. Bye-Bye! They all had things to do. They left me with little Jane and... the nanny from Guatemala, who thought I'd steal her job. I think she put a curse on me. I tried to show my sympathy for Central Americans, but it was no use. On the first day, she asked why I had come to this strange country. Is that him? Yes, that's him. He's an idiot! I feel terrible. How are you? Good! Excuse, it's an important moment. I just wanted to tell you that Peter is my boyfriend. No problem! What's his name? - Peter. - Very typical American boy. Sorry if I disappointed you. Yeah well, nobody's disappointed here. Are you disappointed? Would you stop it! I can't hear anything. Excuse us! At that point, it didn't make sense for me to stay. I thought I'd go but didn't know where. I was sick, but Mrs. Leslie took care of me. One day I was alone. Mr Garfield was out of town, Sally at College, and Jane at day care. Thank you Mrs. Leslie. Open! 100ºF 100 degrees? Shhh! It's okay. Poor baby! - So sick and far away from home! - Yes. You're so hot. Yes. Come here! - I bet you wish you were at home. - Yes. - In your own bed. - Yes. Have a nice long sleep, and when you wake up everything will be better. Yes. - You want me to sing to you? - Yes, Mrs. Leslie. It was a strange feeling. With my fever and her scent of vanilla. I thought she had feelings for me. I fell asleep dreaming wonderful things. Like Mrs. Leslie and me in the clouds. Her revealing her feelings for me... without any bourgeois hypocrisy. I have a question? Why you are sad, Mrs. Leslie? Sorry for asking. Me? Sad? Maybe not "sad", Mrs. Leslie. You are very beautiful, with all respect. You are a very sweet boy. - Hi. - Hi, sweetheart. I'll be in our room. I'll be right there. Put these on and get back into bed! Shit! God only knows what they said. I stayed awake all night... to see if something would happen, but it didn't. The next morning we all had breakfast. - Sleep well? - I slept well. Yes I did. Good, I hope you feel better. I thought I'd leave because even though Americans are open-minded... and not jealous like us, Mr. Garfield said something I didn't quite understand. You and I should go out together. Just you and me, okay? - My father asked you something. - What? He said you both should go out later. Okay, no problem. Good! But why? - Excuse me Mr. Garfield. - Yeah? Where are we going exactly? I don't understand where we're going. Where are we going now? It's a surprise. Surprise? A surprise, yeah. Understand? Don't worry! I felt something very bad was happening. It became clear when Mr. Garfield opened the trunk. Excuse me Mr. Garfield. What is this? What do you think it is? It's a rifle. That's what I thought. - Let's go! - Where? Go ahead! Giuseppe, I then remembered those letters from Death Row inmates. I kept thinking I would die from a rifle made by imperialistic technology. How was your day? Yesterday? Yeah, what did you do? Yesterday, I was at your home. With my wife! There's a misunderstanding. Yesterday, I was alone all day. I swear, Mr. Garfield. - Alone? - Yes, stop playing with that rifle. Yesterday, I had a 100 degree fever. I was in bed all day. I swear on my mother. On my mother! Where was my wife? She go out to work. But not with me. If you don't believe it, ask her. - To work? - Yes, she go with your brother. Mr Michael. Garfield & Garfield! They go with a car. Okay, Move! What? Get out of the way! It's dangerous! Here, You try! No thanks. Come on! Give it a shot! - No. - It's why I brought you here. There is the police! No problem. I'll be right back. He was shooting where it was prohibited, like they do in Napoli! He got a $100 fine, which seemed fair to me. Tanino, where exactly do you live in Rome? - What did he say? - Uncle asked where you live in Rome. Do you know Prenestino? Is that near the Fontana di Trevi? I can practically see it from my window. That's wonderful! I love the Fontana di Trevi. It's such a beautiful spot. And The Colosseum. Amazing! How do you say, Collisio? Colosseo? I can see it from the other window! But only on nice days. The sunny days! That's wonderful! Can you imagine he lives between The Trevi Fountain and Colosseum! Yeah, I heard him. I didn't think The Colosseum and The Fountain were so close. Not at first, but there was a lot of public works. The Jubilee and the Pope changed everything. They moved the Colosseum? No, you don't understand. It's difficult to explain... but when you arrive in Rome, you can't understand nothing. Where there was once a public square, they put a church. A church, for example. Needless to mention the lack of parking. Understand? It's not my fault if you don't know Rome. Have you seen the entire city? You have to trust me a little. I'll take that chicken thigh if you don't want it. - Oh yes, there you go. - Thank you. I think your friend is a joker. I bet he's selling us nonsense. Yeah, he did the same to me. What did you tell me about yesterday? That you had to stay home all day because our guest was ill... and needed to be taken care of. Is that right? Because our funny young Italian friend claims that... my dear little brother picked you up in the morning, and you were gone all day. However, when I called you on your cell phone yesterday, you said you were in Boston. Which means you couldn't be here to pick her up at the same time. It's logical. - Don't you think so, Tanino? - Tanino. This can only mean one thing. That you are a liar, my dear friend. Why does he laugh? What did he say? - Larry, please! - You shut up! I said, shut up please. - Daddy are you crazy? - Maybe I am. Maybe I am. Maybe I got it wrong, again. Maybe you should ask Tanino. I don't understand what I should ask him. Ask him if he was home alone yesterday. Ask if your mother went out with your Uncle Mikey. Larry, don't be ridiculous. Stop interrupting me! You see Sally, It means that they've been screwing around on me for six years. Six fuckin' years! So please ask Tanino about yesterday. - Did you understand? - Frankly no. My father wants to know if what you said is true. About the Colosseum? Is it true my mother went out with Uncle Michael, and you stayed home all day? I was confused. Why was he jealous at me, but shouting at his brother? What could I say to calm everyone down? In doubt, I left that America that I didn't understand. I flew home... to things that were real or maybe just fantasy. You were with me, my friend, like the old times. In our usual place, one day many years ago. What is our position regarding the fall of the Berlin wall? And how will this impact future generations? Tanino, what's going to happen? Giuseppe, I don't understand any of this. I'm too little. Where are you going? You're beautiful. Father - my life! How beautiful you are! What a cute tummy! Run away, Tanino! Watch out for those guys. Run away, Tanino! Run, but where? Where? Dad, answer me! Dad? Hey! Are you leaving, Aladdin? Yes, but it's a secret. Shhh! Cross my heart! Shhh! Be Quiet! Stupid dog, get back inside! - Stop right there! - Oh Shit! Hands off Cuba! Please don't shoot him, Daddy! Come back, you bastard! You destroyed my life! And stole my dog. - How much is a hot dog? - $1.25. - Is that enough? - Perfect! Come on, Cuba. Can I play? I want to shoot too! I'm open, pass it! Pass it here! You're not very democratic! In the lane! Thank you! Cuba! Where am I? Mr. Basilio! Dad! Did I scare you? Did you see? it's Basilio. Angelo, Franco... What beautiful children! What beautiful children! You're a beautiful boy! A kiss for you. One for your father. One for your mother. Yes, I'll be right back. Where are you going? Did you have to leave? Sorry, I don't understand you. Angelo! Santa! Rosa! Rosario! Rosetta! The boy's awake! My friend, You know that feeling you get when you realize you're trapped, and can't realize your destiny? I should beat you up. You left us like jerks. Come here, traitor! You're back! I was brought unconscious to the hospital. They searched my pockets and found Li Causi's business card. Her name is Marinella, like your mother! - Guess who? - Hello... Momma! Yes, They're very kind. - Do you know them? - Marinella! A nice snack will fill you up. We have the things you brought from Castelluzzo. - A young man needs to eat! - Eat! I wrote a little report on the Li Causi family. I'll show you it some day. They're a huge family. Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, cousins, in-laws, aunts, uncles, etc. I still don't get them. They own 3 or 4 pizzerias that are always open. They work day and night. They seem rich, but I think it's just an illusion. Sometimes the men get together to talk serious business. Then they give each other kisses and seem happy. Maybe they're not so bad. They just come from the poorest of our country. They work hard and have nice clothes, a new car, and a fat wife. A college guy like you would make it easily in America. - Nice cut, Perfect! - Beautiful! I paid $1,000 for it in 1981. I was skinny. Do I have to wear this? - Do you know where we're going? - No. - Then you don't listen. - It's a party, no? Yeah, Santa Rosalia party. What's so funny? How you've grown! No thanks, but I'm a little hungry. Do you have any appetizers? - Sorry, I no speak Italian. - No Problem. Italian waiters are an endangered species. Now we're designers, architects, marketers... Exactly! - What do you do here? - Me? - Let me guess. You're creative. - In a certain sense. - Are you a writer? - Somewhat. Stories? Projects, with the intention of realizing them through audio-visuals. - A film maker! - Hopefully. Giuliana De Marco, Medieval Studies at Brown. Tanino Mendolia, I'm a guest here. You're smart to have left Italy. Life's hard there. Though it's odd that so many of us succeeded here. It'd make a good subject for an Altman film, no? Absolutely! Come on, we don't want to miss Buddy. Buddy! Buddy! Thank you! I'm not gonna stand up here and say something boring. Tonight is a time for fun. I just want to say one thing... Thanks, my friends! My heart is all Italian. Viva! Viva! Viva! - Do you know him? - He's the mayor. Carmine "Buddy" Omobono. 100% Casertano. He got off twice for corruption. He's nice enough. These people here re-elected him. You should pay attention to his wife and daughter. - You're a hit. - Me? No. Should I give you some space? - No, She's scary! - No, the poor girl! You know someone he really fears? The guy with the glasses? He looks shifty alright. The professor? He's Director of the Italian Institute. - The one behind him. - Li Causi. - You know him? - Just his name. He escaped from Sicily 20 years ago, after a bloody feud. - Is he calling you? - I don't think so. You know each other! - Excuse me! - Where are you going? - Hey Tanino! - Having a good time? I'm calling you forever! - You're lucky! Come here! - Buddy asked for you. - For me? - His daughter wants to meet you. - It's love at first sight. - I told her you just graduated. - What should I say? - I'll introduce you. You just say something nice to the daughter. I don't feel like it. Are you joking, boy? This is the daughter of Buddy Omobono! - You want to disappoint your mother? - No. And us too? - Nice to meet you. - Speak Italian! It's an honor. - Do you like Seaport? - Immensely. - Did you meet my daughter Angelina? - I haven't had the pleasure. Say, Hi. Don't be shy! - She's scared to speak Italian. - I'm not shy! It's a pleasure! He wants to ask her out. Right? - Yes, if you want... - You can have a cup of coffee! - I can't drink coffee! - She suffers from Tachycardia. - But she likes ice cream. - I love ice cream! - So we'll go one day. - One day? Tomorrow afternoon! - Is tomorrow okay? - Okay! Thank you so much! Take a picture! What was happening to me? I was throwing away everything I believed in. I was becoming a shameless hunter of dowry. I was the understudy of this goon, but it didn't bother me. It was like my DNA was hiding a mafia trait that was now emerging. A voice inside me was saying, "Screw it!" Teach a lesson to the Puglies, Sally, and even you, my friend. Marry the fat girl, get the house and pool, and take a mistress. Love is only a bourgeois concept. Hooray for Free Trade! I loved this America. - Do you like? - Yes, I love italian ice cream! Great! - This is a nice place. - It's great! Do you like Seaport? Yes, Seaport is very nice. Everybody's okay, no problems. I'm happy. Very good! Do you want mine? - You're so kind. Thank you! - You're welcome! You are also kind. Everything's okay? The main point was to agree with her, and the ice cream was no problem. Our first little differences arose at the cinema. Wow! This movie is excellent! I prefer more intellectual films. What movies? My favorite director is Chinawsky, but I doubt... I'm sorry. Teach me! Why? You don't even like these directors. I want to do everything Tanino likes. I had mixed feelings about this girl. She bugged me, and I only tolerated her because of my sinister plan. But she also provoked feelings of pity and even affection. - Night, Tanino. - Goodnight, Angelina. - Can you give me a kiss? - Sure of course. - Thank you so much! - You're welcome. - See you tomorrow! - Until tomorrow. - And so? - It went okay. - How was the film? - Did you kiss? - And so? - It went okay. - How was the film? - Did you kiss? A goodnight kiss? Did you see the house they have? - Tomorrow take her to the restaurant. - And pull out The Big Salami! This shameful play was reaching its final act. They told me to talk intimately. I told her my mother was a Libra, and I once had meningitis. She said she had acne, and snored because of her retainer. According to American dating rules, "What's going to happen, will happen!" I asked myself, How could this happen? And then it happened. Goodnight! Are you crazy? What if your parents see us? They're not home. I'm all alone tonight. - Thank you! - Why? Nobody's ever been nice with me. They all behaved badly. - Thank you, Tanino. - Don't cry! - What are you doing? - Please! - Goodnight, Sir! - Goodnight, Leroy! - Do you have a cigarette? - Sure! - Thank you. - Your welcome, Sir. Goodnight! Giuseppe, I felt strange. I was happy for a job well done, but at the same time bitter. For I had become corrupted. I felt like an anti-hero, cynical yet romantic. And now Ladies and Gentlemen, Please welcome Angelina Omobono. The mayor's beautiful daughter, who will inaugurate our project. Go ahead Miss Angelina! Very good! Thank you! Thank you, Miss Angelina! And now it gives me great pleasure to introduce our beloved mayor, Mr. Carmine Omobono Better known as The Buddy of Seaport. When I was a child, my father used to bring me to the seaside. Not too far from here. I don't believe it! I'm with some friends from Castelluzzo. How are you? You made a huge mess and then you ran off. Your father was jealous of me and your mother. Nothing happened. I swear! It's not my fault if she liked me. I didn't understand. - It must've been embarrassing. - Horrible! Mother left my father. And he went to live with him. - With who? - My Uncle Michael. Then Dad discovered everything you said was true. Maybe it's better like this. Sure! Poor Dad! He's alone with Cuba. Oh, the dog came back! And you and the American boy? It's strange to see you here with these people, in these clothes. You've changed. Sally, What can I say? Are you happy? Well... That's life! This is yours. It's why I came to America. It doesn't matter. You keep it. It's my gift. - Tanino! - Just a minute. - Please excuse me. - You have to go. Bye, Tanino! Bye, Sally! Tanino, Why don't you answer? Dad's waiting for us by the buffet. Who's that girl? She's someone I loved very much. - Let's do this stupid buffet! - Tanino, Wait for me! SPC NEWS, SEAPORT... What's your problem? You want to leave me? If you put it that way, yes. - You can't! - Why can't I? Everything's settled. Dad says we're engaged now. I can change my mind. Impossible! Where would you go? You have no job, no money! We're giving you a big opportunity. That's our deal. - You understand our agreement? - What agreement? Don't be a child! Without us, you're nothing. Without me, you're just a poor, starving Italian. - What did you say? - A poor, starving Italian! A poor, starving Italian? Let me tell you something. You're a spoiled little bitch! Also mafiosa. I hate your house, your clothes and your family. You're rich, but you're trashy and ridiculous. Ridiculous, Funny! You're crazy. - Shut up and come back, Asshole! - Let go! Don't make me look like an idiot! Let go! Now you be a good boy and go back and tell everyone you're sorry. Understand? I don't know what came over me. Maybe my vision was blurry. But my reaction changed my life forever. Look! What have I done? Get that son of a bitch! Daddy, help me! The Mayor's daughter has just been assaulted by her Italian boyfriend. Come back, you little shit! Watch your head, asshole! Ah, Jesus! Dear friend, rest assured that I didn't die there. Otherwise I wouldn't be writing this. I didn't know where that train took me, but it seemed familiar. Excuse me, What's the name of this city? - Is it Boston or is it Seaport? - Boston? - What is he talkin' about? - I don't know. This is Manhattan! Ah, Manah! He's homeless. But it's still America, no? Come on guys, be nice! Is it still America? He's crazy! When I realized where I was, it sent a shiver up my spine. Maybe I shivered also because I was cold. Oh, Mother...! Sam, Where's my jacket? - What are you talkin' about? - It's freezing. Give me my jacket! Fuck off! Some water. A glass of water... normal. From the tap. - Anything else? - No. - Enjoy! - Thank you. Bravo! Any questions for Mr Chinawsky? Excuse me Mr Chinawsky, You are great! Can I... Thanks! Mr Chinawsky! Here's a taxi for you. It was a great honor for me. - Ain't you coming? - With you? If you don't mind. - Washington Square please! - Okay. Where are you going? My name is Tanino. I come from Italy. I love your films. Italy, Beautiful! Yes, it's a beautiful country. Full of contradiction, but... I was in Pesaro. I love Tortellini and Sangiovese. Tortellini, Lasagne, baked pasta, are great. And Italian women! Italian women are very dangerous. Yes, that's right. Very, very much. Okay, bye! But... Mr Chinawsky, I don't have money for the taxi. Excuse me! Misunderstanding. - You are very nice... - Tanino. Tanino. Incredible experience, Mr Chinawsky! Very incredible! Excuse me Mr Chinawsky, Can I video? You're a film maker! Let me see! - Excuse me, but it's the other way. - Yes, I know. Pan slowly... Tanino. Hey Giuseppe, Chinawsky's filming me! It's incredible! - Thanks. - Incredible, Thank you! Giuseppe, it was unforgettable. I've never sat face to face with a great artist like him, who must fight not to be forgotten. Not to mention his financial hardship. That was good. I'll pay you back when I get the money from the University. Forget it! I just want to learn from you. You're my maestro! Okay, we'll make a film together. A beautiful film! You are a film maker! You have a camera. We'll make a film. Come on! I want to go home. Did you mean we'll direct a film together? Yes. - Here we are, Tanino! - You live here? This is different! I'm cold. Should I write the theme and scenario? Hush Tanino, Thanks! You're welcome! My friend! I'm flattered, Mr Chinawsky. Shh! Thanks. Thank you for believing in me. For the film, can I write about my past experiences? Mr Chinawsky? Dear Giuseppe... So my friend, I've updated you with my American adventure, but... I must go now because I need to write down some ideas for the film. I can't wait for tomorrow. Warm Regards from this wonderful world. Life is beautiful. Your friend, Tanino. Mr Chinawsky, it's 11 O'Clock. Eleven! Maestro! It's eleven. It's late. Mr Chinawsky! Mr Chinawsky! Are you okay? What should I do? Seymour Chinawsky... Is that right? Yes, a famous film director. - Yeah sure. Who are you? - Mendolia Gaetano from Castelluzzo, ltaly. - Sorry? - Mendolia. "M" as in Marsala, "E" as in "Enna... Why this thing? Can't he breathe? Is he breathing? I don't understand. - Is he dying? - Please, Mr Mendolia! Sit over there! Mendolia Gaetano? Come with us, please! Gaetano Mendolia, You're under arrest. Anything you say will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If you need, one will be provided. - Understand? - What? Sweet! - Hello. - Hi! Are you done sleeping? He always sleeps. Give us an autograph! - I have to sign? - Go on! You're lucky that the Omobonos dropped the charges. You should thank The Embassy, and Mr. Li Causi. He paid your bail. - Am I free to go? - You're being deported. - They must be looking for you. - So I go home? In Italy! You didn't report for military service. - What will they do to me? - A year in the army won't be bad. The Navy has a certain allure. Thanks. Listen, you need to thank that man there. - It's okay? - No problem, just leave it with me. Mr. Li Causi... Now we've paid for this! 1200 dollars! When I get back home, I'll wire you the money. What will you pay back? Your mother's shop? The rent for your apartment in Rome? Tuition money? - Will you pay back your life? - Why do those things matter? I thought you were an intelligent boy. We expected a lot from you. What a disappointment! Sorry, I didn't understand. Can you explain? What's my life got to do with this? What the hell does my life have to do with this? Easy, boy! So it goes, Written and Directed by Tanino Mendolia. It's the story of a boy's adventure. It hides a deeper truth that he doesn't understand. When he's about to discover something, he gets dizzy and confused. Maybe that's not clear. Let's start again! It's an autobiography about a boy who searches for lost time, Proust style. No, not exactly Proust. Let's start again. It's the story of a boy. One day he discovers that things aren't what they seem. He doesn't realize it right away. Not because he's dumb. It's the story of a boy's journey. Incredible things happen to him. No, wait! It's the story of a boy who escapes and leaves in a plane. In the end he is sent home, also by plane. During his travels, there are things he doesn't understand. On the plane home, he looks back on his journey. It's the story... He writes this story.
