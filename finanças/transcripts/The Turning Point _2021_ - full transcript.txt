- [thunder rumbling] - [rain pours] [brakes whine, hiss] [chattering] It's a great place, a beautiful place. Why you putting up with that? I don't know. I'm not sure I wanna go back to where I was last year. [slow-tempo music playing] NETFLIX PRESENTS [man singing in Italian] [chattering continues] [man 1] You need to empty the trash. It's overflowing. - [man 2] I'll take out the trash later. - [grumbles] Are you washing the dishes, Dad? Leave it. I'll do it later. You'll do them? What will you do? Look at how you live. - This place is... it... it's become a... - A pigsty. [father] An amusement park attraction and a pigsty too. What are all these colors for, all these little comics, all this stuff? Every time I come here, I get depressed. "Your grandmother kept the apartment spotless." "You don't work. You don't study." You haven't said a thing all night. But congratulations. Now you've said it. You think you're fucking with me, but you're only hurting yourself. You took five exams in two years, and you call that studying? Come on, keep going. Make me feel guilty. Ah, now it's me making you feel guilty? Now I get it. Could it be that you're the one making me say the same things all the time, huh? I'm trying, Dad. [sighs] Why is the shelf still like this? Are you waiting for me to fix it? Like the other hideous thing, that electric palm over there. [tires screeching] What's going on in your head? What are you thinking? If there's anything I can do... Look, I know it's hard. I know. I understand you. I used to be just like you. If it weren't for your grandfather. Do you really think I cared about making wine when the Siena wanted me for their youth team? [people yelling] What was I supposed to do, abandon our family traditions? And maybe I didn't have much faith in myself. - [man shouts] - [father] Ludovico. Ludovico! - Yeah. - [father] Are you even listening to me? Yes, Dad. [father] If I bust your balls, it's because I care about you. I know. Okay, I'm going. Oh, I left your medicine here. Oh, that's right. What was that thing you wanted to show me? Oh, forget it, Dad. I'll show it to you next time. Look, I'm gonna give you the money in a couple of weeks. - I have to pay the farmworkers first. - Don't worry about it. We've started making oil. We're still experimenting since it's our first year. Why don't you come over? Stay a couple of days. I'll explain things to you. We can be together a bit. - Your mom will be happy. - Oh, for sure. It's a good idea. Bye. - Good evening. - [woman] Hi. [sighs] [clears throat] Maybe next time. - [video games chiming] - [chattering] Hi, Secco. Hey, you're looking great. You look like Platinette. I was saving my daily "fuck off" for my wife, but you can have it. Come on, gimme a drink. [exhales] - Is he here? - [Secco] Yeah. Can you tell him? [Secco] Mario just got here. - Gimme another, Secco. - [footsteps approach] All right, then. I'm going for a piss. My prostate is driving me crazy. Hey, careful with this, okay? Don't take your eyes off it for... [grunts] Hey! Shit! [engine revving] Asshole, stop! [tires screech] [grunts] [panting] [engine accelerating] [upbeat action music playing] [panting] [panting] [dog barking] [panting] [groans] [groaning] - [panting] - [engine fades] - [Ludovico whimpering] - Shh! Quiet, quiet, quiet. Walk, quiet. Easy, walk. Let's go to your place. Where do you live? Where the fuck do you live? Where the fuck do you live? Take me to your place, quick, fast. - Move. [exhales] - [whimpers] - Do you live alone? Huh? - Yeah. Yeah. - [man] Do you live alone? - [Ludovico] Yes. - [man] Come on, open up. Open up. - [Ludovico] Yeah. [man] Where the fuck do you live? Which one is it? Fuck. It... it's this one. - Open. Come on, open. - [grunts, gasps] [panting] - Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on, fuck. - [gasping] [lock clicks] [gasping] - Gimme the keys. - Yeah, yeah. Shh, quiet. And also your phone. Your phone. [Ludovico panting] - You said you live on your own? - Huh? - Do you live on your own? - Yes. - Yeah? Get in here. - [whimpers] Yeah. [ragged breathing] - All right. Hey. What's wrong? - [gasping] - Huh? What's wrong? What's wrong? - Hang on. - [man] Sit down. - [ragged breathing continues] Fuck. Hey, talk. Fuck, what is it? - [Ludovico] Panic attack. - What can I do? [Ludovico panting] My drops. The bag. - This one? Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. [gasps] [man] Which one? How the fuck does it open? How many? - [Ludovico] Ten. - Let's make it 15. [Ludovico panting] [grunts, coughs] [panting] - [man] Fuck. - [breathing stabilizes] [man exhales] Ah. [sighing] Aw, fuck. Sit down. Hey, sit down. [engine idles] Picchio, it's me. Listen up. I don't give a fuck what time it is. I need you to send me 20 kids right now. I need a watchman day and night outside the condominiums. They need to work in shifts. I said now! [lighter clicks] [panting] [grunts] Ludovico Fazi, is it you? [panting] You can call me Jack. I'm gonna have to stay here for a while. They're looking for me. They know what I look like. They know I'm in the area, but I'll find a way to get out, okay? [exhales] If you act up, I'll have to kill you. However, if you play along, I'll give you a nice gift for the trouble when I go. A gift? Do you hear me when I talk to you? Listen closely because I will not repeat myself. You stay here, nice and quiet. Forget about the rest of the world. And when I go, you'll get 5,000 euros. Cash. Five thousand? What did I fucking tell you? You'll get it when I leave. You have to earn it though. [sighs] So we have a deal. Hey. Mind your own fucking business. - Understood? - Yeah. [engines revving] [Jack] Fucking spies. I should have been on the other side of the world by now. [exhales] I'm going to sleep now. It's been a bad night. I'm beat. Get up! Now get in there. - Come on. - [grunts] Didn't we agree on 5,000? You're gonna spend the night in here. Where's the key? [sighs] [lock clicks] [keyboard clacking] [man] He knew about the cameras. He just didn't care. And he knew Mario was carrying a lot of money tonight. That means he was planning to steal it, and he was probably hoping to vanish right after the theft. "It doesn't matter who you really are." "What matters is what other people think you are." [scoffs] Let's have a little chat with the genius downstairs. [sighs] [sighs] Bye, Caino. [door screeches] Right, Mario, let me get this straight. You put your bag here on the stool. You got up to go to the bathroom. The guy pushed you, grabbed the bag and took off. Yeah, but I almost caught him. I swear, Caino. He fell off his bike and started running like a madman. I was right behind him on my bike, but then... Then you let him get away. Mind you, I wasn't asking for a justification. I was asking for an explanation. I'm sorry, Caino. But I know where he is. He went into the apartment buildings, the ones near the market. His days are numbered. Trust me. He's hiding in one of the apartments. That's for sure. Yeah, you see? [exhales] [Mario sighs] He dropped this. Here. It's your money. [Caino] Hmm. I got 20 kids down there right now. They're checking everyone going in and out. As soon as this son of a bitch sticks his nose out, I'm gonna get him. How are you gonna find him? Did you see his face? [gulps, exhales] Do you know what's the most important thing for a man? It's their reputation. It doesn't matter who you really are. What matters is what other people think you are. Your reputation is your destiny, like your character. Everyone knows that whoever steals from me is a dead man. This is the reputation I've built for myself, and I can't have it destroyed by some random guy. You understand, yeah? - Yeah. - [Caino] Of course you understand. You've been working for me for many years. Do you believe in destiny, Mario? Yeah, I do. [Caino] Then play. Discover your destiny. What drives people to gamble? Is it greed? Poverty? Loneliness? Or is it human nature? The more you lose, the more you wanna get it back. And that's all there is to it. Don't you agree, Mario? - [coin rattles] - [machine chiming] - [Mario] I won! - [bell rings] - [fanfare plays] - I won, Caino! - You see? Destiny's on my side! [grunts] - [gunshot] [coins rattling] [Caino] Yeah. But you were the one who believed in destiny, not me. I'll get him. Stinking son of a fucking bitch. Spartaco, watch your language. I want him here alive. Twenty-four hours. Or you'd better disappear too. Take him away and clean up this mess. Fucking hell! I can't believe he blew his brains out without batting an eye. Who? You mean Buzzetti? Who else? He's a hit man. He just follows orders. The real killer is Caino. Well, for someone who killed his own brother just for money, even if no one could prove he did it. Don't forget the four or five other deaths he credits himself with. I hate him. Just hate him. He thinks he's a fucking god. When he talks to me, it's like he's talking to a cockroach. I understand that, but Mario as well? Hey, what about Mario? Don't you say a bad word about Mario. I've known him since I was 20. [both grunt] [Spartaco] Then what are you saying? If someone steals my car and you can't catch the thief, it's okay for me to kill you? Caino can't suffer anyone to be smarter than he is. Everyone knows that. He's got an inferiority complex. Where did you read that, Marzio? And then who the fuck is he? Who does he think he is? Napoleon? [grunts] He's a loan shark who hides behind some betting shop full of old women and junkies, bars and restaurants outside of town. - But he's rolling in it. - [Spartaco] Yeah, so fucking what? He wears a suit and cologne, but he's still a fucking beggar. A guy who fixed fights. Shitty little megalomaniac. Mario had three children and a wife, a total babe by the way. - Caino had him killed like a dog. - [Marzio] You know what I heard? That Caino's been fucking Mario's wife for a while now. - What are you talking about? Giulia? - Yeah. I swear. And I think he already wanted him dead for that. This is just an excuse. [exhales] [Spartaco] No, no. That's impossible. You don't touch a friend's woman. That's just how it is. And trust me, Giulia doesn't fuck around either. - I can promise you that. - [cell phone ringing] I hit on her loads of times, but she never put out. - She did with Caino though. - Fill this hole in and shut the fuck up! - Picchio. - Oh, it's just Picchio. [Spartaco] Nobody showed up, huh? - Keep your eyes peeled. - [grunts] Can you take a photo of this guy with your phone and send it to Picchio? - [Marzio] Sure. I can do it. - Good boy. You can rest easy now, Mario. Rest in peace, friend. [dog barks in distance] [Jack sighing] - [worker] That's why they pay so much. - [worker 2] To hell with 'em. The administrator is raking it in too, but he's not risking shit. [worker] He's a bit of a schemer. You get it? [worker 2] And if you fall, they say you should have been careful. Like Stelvio's cousin. Poor guy. You remember? - Ah, of course I do. Yeah. - [worker 2] May he rest in peace. [knocking on door] [scoffs] [inhales] [toilet flushes] Are you wearing one of my shirts? Yeah, I've also had a shower and a shave. Do you want a coffee? - So you used my things? - [Jack] Don't be a pain. My clothes stank of garbage. When they dry, I'll give yours back. Do you want a coffee? Why are you using my grandmother's antique china cups? Because these are cups. You fill them up, and then you drink from them. If you want some, come and get it. Your grandma? What was she, a singer, a musician? No, she gave piano lessons. - Did you put this up? - [Ludovico] Mm-hmm. - It's broken. It doesn't work. - [Jack] "It's broken. It doesn't work." Is it that difficult to fix? - Here. Wash this one too. - [cup clinks] What about these big books? Were you at school? What's with the interrogation? What do you think you are, a cop? [exhales, clears throat] I asked you a question. - I'm studying economics. - Haven't taken many exams I bet. It takes five minutes to figure you out and write your story from birth to now. Such a sad story. Okay, that's enough! [Jack] I was just making small talk. All these movies, comics, unopened textbooks. What am I supposed to think? [Ludovico] I study the comics. I draw. - What do you draw? - I draw my own comics. - The only thing I've ever been good at. - I can picture you. Sitting there with the light from the lamp, alone. Always alone. Zero friends. Do you have a girlfriend at least? - Of course not. - Look, I've had two girlfriends. - [Jack] A player! - A thief and a psychologist. Don't get uppity or I'll rip your head off. I don't give a fuck how you ended up the way you are. It's probably not your fault, but it's not mine either. We clear? I have a serious illness. What do you mean? You're sick? How long? It's been a year. Is that what the hat's for? You're doing chemo? Chemo? Yeah. You do know depression isn't treated with chemo, right? - Depression? Fuck off. - Gimme my hat back! Take this thing off. It's not like you're bald. What do you know about depression? You stuff yourself with that bullshit medication in the bathroom to convince yourself you're sick and hide like a rat. And you know why? Because you hate yourself. You don't need a degree to understand that. Listen, the guy who lives across the way, what does he do, odd jobs? I saw that he has cans of paint outside his door. No, the concierge told me his wife wanted a new kitchen. He has a bar. He's a borderline alcoholic. Would you happen to have an X-ray in your apartment? - An X-ray of his wife? - Yours. You said you were sick. Did a doctor give you an X-ray? - Yes, I have an X-ray. - Okay. Listen then. Let's do this. Since there's nothing to eat here, you're gonna grab the X-ray, go over there, open the door. It's not a security door. It should be easy. You go in, empty the fridge and come back here. You must be crazy. I'm not a thief. - I've never done it. - A little adrenaline won't hurt, right? No, no, no, no, no. No way. First, his wife is definitely gonna be home. - You ring first to see if she's there. - Oh, yeah, sure. And what if she opens the door? - Ask her for some salt. - And what am I gonna do with the salt? [whispers] Go, come on, go. [exhales] [doorbell ringing] [jazz music playing] The X-ray. Put it under the lock and pull it up. Up. - [lock clicks] - [inhales sharply] - [man] Don't walk away from me, bitch... - [Ludovico mouths] Come on. [man] Are you seeing someone else? You can't do this to me. [woman] Again, Filippo? I'm not seeing anyone else. Stop it. Open the door, Jack. [woman] I hope I find someone normal soon. [Filippo] Someone normal, huh? I'll make you regret it, you and that asshole. Don't you dare threaten me or I'll call the police. You understand? Get off of me. Filippo, get off of me! I'll scream! You're hurting me! [in Spanish] Hey, Rebecca! Are you okay? [in English] Yes. I'm okay. [Filippo huffs] What are you looking at? Little shit. [gasps] If you see anyone else, I'll destroy you. [Rebecca] Do you realize? Two years wasted with that asshole! Please excuse him. He's the little shit. [door clicks] [sighs] [knocks] [Jack exhales] Stand up. Stand up straight. Hit here, come on. - Come on. - [grunts] - What's this? Come on. Harder. - [grunts] - Again. Go! - [grunting] Go again. Harder, don't stop. Hit. Go, go, hit! Harder! Use the other one too! - Come on, get it out! Get it out, huh? - [grunting] Way to go! Enough, enough, enough. Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough. Shh! [mutters] Shh! Good. Yeah? Oh, you have a good right hook, you know? Next time you see him, plant your fist in that fucker's face. Now relax. Follow my lead. [inhales, exhales] Better? Hmm? Now we're gonna go to the neighbor's together, okay? Yeah. [lock clicks] [Jack whispering] Be quiet. Shh! [music playing indistinctly through earphones] Come on. [jazz music playing] - [telephone rings] - [Ludovico gasps] [Jack] Shh! Oh, hi. Hi, my love. Oh, babe. I'm alone. My husband is out until tonight. So we have the whole afternoon to ourselves. - What are we playing today? - [door squeaks] [woman] Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mm, no, no, no, no. Come on, we did that last time. Mmm. You know that. I will always say yes to you anyway. Why do you want me to go to the kitchen? Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Ice cubes. Mmm. I think I know. [clattering] Yes, sir. - I got the ice. - [door closes] You know what you are? You're such a dirty, tiny, little animal who grunts for me. - [Ludovico snorts] - [woman] Yes. Guess which one. - A pig! - [Ludovico laughing] [woman] Ah, yes! Yes. No. I'm wearying the burgundy ones. The really tiny ones. Yeah. [laughs] But they are bothering me a little because they slip inside me. And you? What are you doing? Oh! And how? [sighs] You really are a pig. You know that? Yeah, I'm a piggy too. A real pig. The ice cubes are melting. I'm going to lie on the bed now. Yeah, yeah, I'm lying down. - [Jack] Bravo! Well done! Amazing! - [Ludovico] Come on, keep it down. [Jack] That's the way. That's it. - Let's see what we've got here. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [Jack laughs] - I've never done anything like that. - [laughs] Well, it's not like it hurt you. Hey, it was like Alvaro Vitali and Bombolo. - Remember those clowns? - Starring Fenech? She reminded me more of Sharon Stone, where she crosses her legs without her panties on. [laughs] [Jack] You liked it, eh? You're honest out of fear, not principle. Hey, gimme my hat back! Come on, Jack, gimme my hat back. - [Jack] Come on. - [panting] My God. My heart's racing. I need a tranquilizer. I'll be right back. - No, stop. What tranquilizer? - [grunts] - Here. Come on. Drink this. - [panting] - It's on the house. - No, Jack, I-I get weird if I drink. What, are you normal now? Now drink. I saw you laughing while horny for ten minutes. It was more than I hoped for. Come on, drink. [laughs] [Ludovico gulps, coughs] - Picchio. - [Picchio] Hey, Spartaco. What's up? Our guys hasn't come out of either one of these buildings. - Listen to Ferruccio. - [Spartaco] What does he have to say? A friend of mine knows about him. He says he lives in the dump behind the gasometro. He cleans out cellars, hauls stuff away. Things like that with a van. He worked with his brother, but nobody knows what happened to him. - Take me to where this asshole lives. - I've already checked the place out. The property's barred up. Plus, the van ain't there anymore. And tell your friend that I wanna know more. If he has a girlfriend, a son, a wife, if we can find his brother. Got it? So is it true what they say? That he stole from Caino? - If he did that, he's a dead man. - Just wait till we catch him. Caino will stuff him in a slot machine. - In fact, you know what I think? - Hey, relax, Marzio. Thinking is bad for your health. I got a different idea. We'll do the usual. Do we have the stuff in the car? Kind of respect the dumb son of a fucking bitch. Stealing from that shit stain Caino takes balls. In fact, you know what I'm gonna do? When we find him, I'm gonna shake his hand out of respect, then shoot him. Yeah, but remember that Caino wants him alive. And if we take the money? What do you mean "we take the money"? Take it for ourselves? This isn't that complicated. Just tell him, "Dad, if I have to fail, I wanna fail at something I like doing." Who's stopping you? Nobody. Um, I don't... I don't even have the guts to show him the drawings I do. I mean, I should have never been born. My parents had me late in life. No one was expecting my mom to get pregnant. You don't wanna study. You don't have the courage to do what you like. You have this neon light, and you don't use it. [grunts] You don't even wanna fix it. And you don't have the balls to speak with your father. If I had more time, I'd fix you as well. Ha! Depressed artist, come and see this. Jack, that's awesome. [doorbell rings] Who the fuck is that? [Ludovico] Who is it? [Spartaco] Water department. There's a leak in the area. - Hello. - Hi, there. [Spartaco] We'll take a quick look and then go. We have to check the whole building. Are you working overtime? [Spartaco] It's an emergency. May I? Yes, yes, go ahead. - [banging] - [shudders] [drill whirs] [exhales] Kitchen's fine. Where's the bathroom? The bathroom's right there. You know, my son's crazy about comic books. Oh, yeah? How old is he? He's 12, and he has the same hat that you're wearing. Oh. [inhales] Anything unusual in the last few days? Unusual in regards to the water? No, everything's... everything's normal, all normal. The bathroom's perfectly fine. Okay then. [exhales] You take care. - Bye, take care. - Sorry for bothering you. No problem at all. No fucking way they were from the water department. They're looking for you because of the money in your backpack, right? [lighter clicks] The less you know, the safer you are, so don't ask again. I'm not gonna stay here too much longer anyway. [whirring] [laughs] You see, it took five minutes, and you earned a pound of self-esteem. - Am I renovating the house? - We are. Come on. [Jack] Wow, they're beautiful. - Did you draw these? - Put them down. - Why? They're really good. - Put them down immediately! Now! - What, are you crazy? - Put those drawings down right now! Put them down! Take them back. Now don't break my balls 'cause I need to get some sleep. Don't you dare make any noise. Mad as a hatter this guy. [exhales] [Spartaco] Giulia. [Caino exhales] Caino, I have an update for you. Caino, I have an update for you. [Caino exhales] You shouldn't disturb me when I'm in the middle of very important work. Apologize. [Spartaco exhales] I said apologize! I'm sorry. Don't take advantage of the debt of gratitude I owe your father. May God rest his soul. Go ahead. He's a nobody. He cleans out cellars, hauls stuff away. A loser. Someone brave enough to steal 500,000 euros from Caino is no loser. But he'll never enjoy the money. He's being hunted. Where can he go? He has to come out of whatever hole he's hiding in eventually, right? He's never gonna enjoy the money. He's being hunted. He has to come out. More or less the same things our poor friend Mario said. Gimme 24 hours, I'll bring him here. I swear. Twenty-four hours. And I hope you have a good plan. The wind is never favorable for the sailor who doesn't know where he's going. Now get out. You were right about Giulia. What a fucking backstabbing whore. [exhales] If it wasn't for my father, he'd have gotten rid of me a long time ago. You understand? This is bullshit. [exhales] Meanwhile, my father ended up saving Caino's entitled ass. He went to prison in his place. I'm only saying that Caino can hurt us and badly. And then that psychopath Buzzetti really scares me. It's as though he actually enjoys killing. I'll have Buzzetti for breakfast. It's that shit Caino that I wanna see on his knees. He'll be crawling on the floor. I'll make him lick my shoes. So what do we do now? We told him 24 hours. We'll never make it. You put yourself in a tough spot. Ah, come on, Marzio. What the fuck? You too? All you do is bring bad luck! Fucking hell, man! Fuck! [slow guitar music playing] [inhales] [inhales] [exhales] [sniffles] It's a detective story. [sniffles] A metropolitan thriller that's set in Garbatella. Which looks like a nice quiet neighborhood. Not even with your imagination do you leave home, huh? At least Sàlgari was brave enough to imagine Malaysia from his desk. - Salgàri. - Whatever. Him. These drawings are amazing. Why are you wasting your time studying economics? Have you show any of these drawings to the little woman you like? - What are you talking about? - Don't play dumb. I saw her picture in the bathroom behind the tranquilizers. I don't even wanna know why you put it in there. - So what's her name? - [chuckles] Rebecca. And what about the friend who was looking out with her from the landing? [chuckles] Well, she's from Seville. She's Spanish. They did a semester abroad together. [Jack] The Spanish are beautiful. Clean, no makeup. All natural. [exhales] - Have you ever spoken to Rebecca? - No. Yes. Yes, we talked a few times because she wanted to borrow my DVDs. She's working on a dissertation on Italian cinema from the '60s and '70s for school. [Jack] Now I know why you have all this stuff. You wanna look cool in front of her. I get it. Look cool? Did you see who she was with? - What am I supposed to do? What do I... - Stop right now. Even the cleverest of women fall for a garbage human being at least once in their lives. Trust me. All the ones I went out with were clever. - [scoffs] - Yeah, for sure. That was a joke. - [chuckles] - [Jack] So there's no problem. But you'll never know unless you try. Maybe she wouldn't mind if you tried. She did just break up with that asshole. - No, it's complicated. - No, you're making it complicated. Listen, some women are only after money, others after looks, some character. Money-wise, you're not doing too great. Character-wise, we need to work on it. With looks, you're kind of, you're thinking, "I'm doomed." - Well, I mean, yeah. - But you're not. Because you have something that interests someone like Rebecca. I'm sure of it. You have a soul. I have a soul? I mean, it's... it's just kind of weird to hear you talk about the soul. - Why, do you have the copyrights? - No. A soul is something you either have or you don't have. Nietzsche said it so too. - Educate yourself. - [chuckles] Now you're thinking, "What the fuck does he know about Nietzsche?" [Ludovico] Well... [Jack] Instead, I'm thinking it's not gonna be easy to get out of here. [Jack] Got it? [man] I'll come back when everything's ready. - Let me know right away. Bye. - [man] Okay. [Jack] Hey! Rebecca is coming up with her friend. Go talk to her. - No way. I'll make a fool of myself. - Just pretend you're leaving right now. You help her with her shopping bags and invite her over for dinner. - Kind but firm. Tell her you'll cook. - I can't even cook. - And I have no idea where to start, no. - What kind of man are you? - Only if you come with me. - I went with you to steal. This is something you have to do on your own. - No, no, no, no. No way, no. - It's time to grow some balls. Come on. [scoffs] No. No, no, no, no. - Hola. - Oh, hi, Ludovico. Got a heavy load. Can I lend you a hand? - Ah, thank you. - Thanks a lot. - Were you going out? - No, I was just coming home from a walk. That's a very cute hat. - Oh, thank you. - [chuckles] [laughs] Oh, this is Amanda. I don't know if you remember. I told you about her. You did a semester abroad together, right? I'm L-Ludovico. Uh, sorry, I really have to run to the bathroom to pee. She's nice, huh? Listen, since we've just bumped into each other, I'd like to ask you something. I mean, actually, I've been meaning to ask you for a while, but I don't know. I didn't... I didn't wanna be a pain. You, a pain for me? Of course not. My thesis. Italian cinema of the '60s. Dino Risi... You're an expert, aren't you? Y-y-yeah, yeah. Is there any chance you could help me with it? - Please... Please don't say no. - No. - [sighs] - [splutters] I mean, I mean... Yes, that is... it's... it's not a problem. Absolutely not and I'm a big fan of Dino Risi. - So, uh, I don't know. - [laughs] [Ludovico] We could watch a few movies, analyze them together. - [Rebecca] That would be great. - [Ludovico] Um, A Difficult Life, The Widower, Scent of a Woman... Well, what about if I come to your apartment? You... You come to my place? One of my favorite Dino Risi films is a crime anthology actually, with Nino Manfredi. It has such incredible acting. And it's called I See Naked. [in Spanish] Hey, it took you a long time to walk up those few steps. [in English] Uh, the, uh, these are mucho heavy, so... If you need me, I'll be in the shower. Yes, yes. Please, come inside. You want me to put these on the table here? [Rebecca] Yes, thanks a lot. - [Amanda] Hey, Ludovico. - Yeah. [in Spanish] You know anything about plumbing? Uh, of course. [in English] It's that damn faucet. I've asked the manager 300 times to come sort it out. Do you think you could maybe... Ami, can you show him? [Amanda] Come, come, Ludo. You see, uh, I turn on the shower. - And the thing there, it got stuck. - Mm-hmm. Um... [in Spanish] That one there. [both gasp] [Amanda laughs] Sí. - [in English] The problem is it's b-burst. - [laughing] - [in Spanish] I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. - Ludovico. [tires screech] [exhales] [in English] Piece of shit. You looking for someone? - Get out of the way. - [Jack] I asked you a question. Out of the way, asshole. You're the one who beats up women, and I'm the asshole, huh? [Filippo panting] You go anywhere near Rebecca again, and you're a dead man. She's with a friend of mine now. He's even more dangerous than I am. She doesn't wanna see you here again. Show up one more time and this shitty little face of yours... - [Filippo panting] - ...boom! Boom! - I'll destroy you. - Mm-hmm. - Got it? - Mm-hmm. - [Jack] Hmm? - Mm-hmm. [panting] And you pissed yourself on top of everything. Some hero you are. Now get up and get lost. You stink. - Go on, get. - I'm... I-I'm going. [Jack] Run away. [Filippo panting] - [Picchio] Hey! - [gasps] No, no, no, no, easy, easy, bro. What happened to you? What the fuck happened to you? Fucker had a gun. If it weren't for that, I'd have kicked the shit... Did he really have a gun, bro? Listen, does he look like this? Hey, where you going? Where you... [car door opens] - [engine turns over] - [door closes] - [tires screech] - [engine revs] [Amanda in Spanish] Thanks anyway. Jack, you tried your best. [in English] Yeah, come on. I think it stopped now, no? Anyway, tomorrow I'll call a plumber, a good one. [laughing] A real one. I really tried. I'm sorry. [in Spanish] To thank you for your effort, I'd like to cook my famous paella. [in English] Oh, yeah, sure, come on. Why don't we have a dinner together? Tomorrow night? Would you like that? [both] Do we like that? - Well, yeah, I'd say yes too. - [laughs] We'll have Italian versus Spanish. You make paella. We make amatriciana. [in Spanish] If you cook and do everything else like you do plumbing... [all laughing] [Ludovico] Hmm. [chuckles, in English] Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I fucking love you, Jack. Are you my guardian angel? It's called Stockholm Syndrome. You fell in love with your kidnapper. Well, actually, it's a fucking stroke of luck. I looked like such a moron with that shower. But I told you I couldn't do it. That's why I asked you to come up. Anyway, the little Spaniard was eating you up with her eyes, huh? [Jack] We're out of booze, not to mention, weed. Well, no, I should have some here, I think. I just don't use it often. It makes me a bit anxious. But since I'm already anxious, maybe it'll help me this time. How long have you smoked weed? I don't know. For a while. I don't smoke much. Alone, obviously. Always alone. But maybe next time with Rebecca. [knock on window] [man] Everything's sorted. I took care of it. - [Jack] You did great. Here. - [man] And then? - [Jack] The rest when we say goodbye. - [man] Okay. - [Jack] Ciao. - [man] Bye. [sighs] Look at this. You could be my little brother. - 'Cause I'm so tall, and you're short. - [chuckles] I wanna be like you. Do you really think that I'm better than you? Look right there. Stay the way you are. You don't wanna be like someone else. Trust me. - [lighter clicks] - [exhales] - [inhales] - [Jack] I'm a thief. Always have been. Started saving a little bit of money and now I can live off the interest from this last job. [inhales] I have a cover job. I clean out cellars, haul stuff away, little jobs like that. I even provide invoices. [chuckles] I used to work with my brother. Everything I know about life, I learned from him. Although the more you try to understand this life, the less you seem to get. You have a brother? [inhales] He's eight years older. [exhales] Paolo. We used to steal together. But he played the saxophone. He was in a band. When people say it's the parents' fault if someone grows up wrong, I always laugh. My father died at the farmers market. It was an accident. Then my mom a year later. [scoffs] [grunts] She was a cleaning lady. They were good, honest people. Me and Paolo, thieves. How come? Don't know. [exhales] I was 18 when he left the country. He would always tell me, "Study." [emotional music playing] "And read books." He would buy them by the dozens. I still have 'em. And the helmet. I'd never part with it because I'm attached to it. - Yeah, but he still left you by yourself. - No. No, he even said to me, "Come with me. Come on, it'll be a turning point." But I didn't feel like leaving. Mm. [chuckling] Then he got together with this Brazilian girl, nice piece of ass. I was even a little bit jealous. [grunts] Look here. "Mar do Paraíso." Look at that. - Damn! - He sent it to me three years ago. - Sure you'll find him when you go there? - I'll find him. I'll find him. Paolo's a very clever guy. Everyone must know him. If this shit didn't fucking happen, I'd probably already be there right now. Morning on the beach. Afternoon in a hammock with a good book. And at night, clubbing with all the women. [both laugh] Did you know that the Nazis would burn books? They were scared of them. And they were scared of women too. You know, the SS encouraged their soldiers to fuck one another all the time. - [laughing] - So what though? - I swear it's true. - [Jack] But so what? [exhales] I used to beg my father to let me come and live here on my own. I wanted to show him what I was worth. I felt like an artist. I wanted to sort out the apartment in my own unique way. But then I locked myself inside it. Alone. - As you say, always alone. - [chuckles] To be honest, I'd feel lonely in a place full of people. I've always felt this way since I was a kid. The only world in which I'm happy is the world of drawings. I mean, in the world I draw up, you know? I don't know. Maybe I'm scared to find out who I am, scared of discovering myself, of... of seeing myself. Of disappointing my folks. Don't hide behind your parents. Ludi, you're not a child. You're too old for that. You don't have to feel alone. Humanity is alone. It's not easy for anyone. [laughs] This joint is the fucking shit. It's making us talk like... like philosophers. [laughing] - [exhales] - You know what I think? - Hmm. - Don't know. [laughing] Well, you make it look pretty easy. I mean, your answer to literally everything is "don't know." I know that I do not know. Don't know. It is ancient wisdom. [laughing] You know who said that? - Socrates. - [laughing] [Spartaco] So now that... our guy smashed the face of that stuck-up asshole, we know he has a gun. And we know he's in stairwell A. [exhales] We finally found that fucker. And how's that? Didn't you already check that old staircase? We checked every apartment, Caino. We didn't see him. You didn't search thoroughly. We searched very thoroughly. If you had, you would have found him, but no. Instead, Picchio did. And you come here and tell me, "We finally found that fucker"? By the way, your language is really starting to rub me the wrong way. I gave you a second chance, and yet, you wasted it of course. Pearls before swine. So people can wrong Caino and not suffer the consequences. That's what everybody will think, right? Give him 24 hours, he's gonna find him. My debt to your father ends today, Spartaco. You no longer work for me. And be grateful that destiny gave you a good friend who can pay for your mistakes when necessary. You believe in destiny, Marzio? [screams] - [Spartaco] Marzio! Marzio! - [Marzio groaning] Look at me. Look at me. Marzio. - Marzio. - [Marzio panting] [groans] I'll kill you! Your father sacrificed his life for me. In return, I'm going to spare yours. Now get out of here. And from this day on, make sure you never cross my path again. It would've been better to kill him. There's a time and a place for everything. Now I want you to go and look for our guy. Find out the apartment number. And when you find him, take me to him. I wanna deal with him myself. He's earned it. [ominous music playing] [exhales] [huffs] [laughs] Scared, huh? - [inhales] What is wrong with you? - I was joking. I was joking! - What the fuck are you doing? - I was joking! [whimpers] [panting] [Jack sighs] [exhales] You fucking moron. Get off me. [gun clicking] - [clicks] - [Ludovico grunts, exhales] [Jack sighs] You never shoot with your eyes closed. If your hand shakes, you miss, and if you miss, you won't have time for the second shot. [Ludovico exhales] Trintignant. [imitates gun firing] Stop, doesn't suit you. - How long did I sleep? - A long time. It's two in the afternoon. - You got painkillers? I have a headache. - Yeah. [exhales] Always here these guys. Did you clean up the apartment? Yes, sir. I got up early today. All clean. [pills rattling] Here. Another step forward. Well done. If only your dad could see it now. Poor guy. Every time he leaves me money, I feel really guilty. You still have the 5,000 I promised, right? Yes, thank you again. [Jack exhales] How long will it take you to finish the comic? - What do you mean by "how long"? - You know, how long? How long will it take you to draw it, print it, publish it. I don't know. Could be four to six months tops. [Jack] Okay, let's say a year. - Take a sabbatical and I'll finance you. - [laughs] A year sabbatical? [Jack] You don't worry about anything. Just sit there, draw what you like. Money's not a problem for me anymore. There's a fortune in that bag. After a year, if it doesn't work out for you, you go back to what you're doing now. You're behind with your exams anyway, aren't you? Yeah, I'm behind. [Jack] I already told you. If you're gonna have to fail in life, it's better to fail at something you like to do. Thanks for your faith in me. - Hey. - What? What's there to think about? I can withdraw the offer. Seriously. Who the fuck else would make you an offer like that? You know what? I'm gonna try. I'll try. I'll try. I'll try. I'll go for it. I'll focus. I'll do it. I'll go ahead and submit the comic, and if it works out, I'll even publish it. I'll even put in a dedication for you on the front page. Dedicate it to Rebecca, Ludovico. I just need you to send me 50% of the profits when I'm over there. [cell phone vibrating] Rebecca. No, it's Jack. Shh! [whispers] Huh? - Paella versus amatriciana? - [grunts] [chuckling] That's fine. Hasta la vista. [in Spanish] May the best win. [in English] Bye. There. In case Rebecca calls you back. Just don't call the police on me. It's been forever since a girl called me. Listen, what about the amatriciana? Pasta, jowl bacon, pecorino, tomatoes. Here. Now fuck it. Come on. Get everything you need. Get the fuck out. Me, go outside? [Jack mutters] Make sure you act normal when you pass those kids down there on the scooters. - Act normal? - No. Don't act normal. Act Ludovico. [door opens, closes] [sizzling] And then we're gonna add this at the end. - [Ludovico] Try the sauce, see how it is. - Ah, you try it. - [blows] Okay, well, it's pretty hot. - [blows] - Mm. - [blows, slurps] - Wow, it's so good. - Mm. Anyone would screw a guy who made an amatriciana this good. Then say I made it. You know the Spaniard would screw you even on an empty stomach. - You wish. - [doorbell rings] Who the fuck is here now? It's probably Rebecca. - [Buzzetti] Good evening. - Hi, there. Gas department. A leak has been reported. Come in. Look, your colleagues from the water department have been here already. Is something happening in the neighborhood? No, don't worry about that. Where's the meter? The meter's over there under the sink. - [exhales] - [camera shutter clicks] Everything okay? For now, yeah. [Ludovico] Yes, yes, I draw. [exhales] - The bathroom? - The bathroom is right there on the right. If you want, I'll turn on the light for you. [Buzzetti sighs] [exhales, groans] Electric. And the bedroom. In the bedroom, there's nothing connected to the gas. - [gun cocks] - [panting] [Buzzetti sighs] Of course. There's nothing. No. Yes, right? There's nothing here. Mmm! [sniffs] Well, so, um, I was making amatriciana. My grandmother's secret recipe. And... if you don't mind, I'll show you out. - [Buzzetti] Parmesan? - [Ludovico] Pecorino, of course. [Buzzetti] Pecorino, huh? [Ludovico] Parmesan on amatriciana would be a crime. [Buzzetti] It would be a crime, of course. Right? - [door opens] - [Ludovico] Absolutely. Goodbye. - [door closes] - [Jack exhales] Yeah, I found him. Stairwell A. Apartment 14. No, right now. I... I don't care if you're having dinner. You need to get over here now. [Ludovico] What's going on? What are you doing? Do you know who that was? Did you see his shoes? - Who, the gas guy? - Yeah, right, the gas guy. He's a hitman, a psychopath. He was looking for me here. Our friendship ends here, Ludovico. I have to go. Don't worry. Come with me. Come over here. I'm gonna hide in there, okay? I made an arrangement with a construction worker who lives nearby. You can't hide inside a dump truck. It's very dangerous, Jack. I'll be at the airport in half an hour. Just make sure they don't find you here, okay, hmm? You need to run. Look. Huh? This is the money for your sabbatical, okay? I'll leave it here. Hmm? Hey. I'll be in touch when I get there. I'll buy you a ticket. You'll come meet my brother and make sure you bring the published comic, hmm? [knocking on window] Here, put this on. Two seconds. All right, I'll be right there. [sniffles] Ludovico. Hey. Ludovico my ass! You hear me? You used me, and now you're leaving like this? What will I do? What everyone does. I told you, everyone's alone. Yeah, sure. Better to be alone than to be with you. You're used to it in your family, aren't you? Go fuck yourself. You're not my brother. [exhales] [footsteps clanking] [sniffles] [sniffles] [panting] [sniffles] - [grunts] - [knocking] Open up, dickhead. Hurry up. [Ludovico gasps, grunts] Come on. What are you doing? [Jack] What am I doing? I'll leave after dinner. [inhales, exhales] - [grunts] - Thank you, Jack. [grunts] [Jack] You think I would have missed out on the Spaniard? Thank you. - Thank you! - That's enough. Go and get the sauce. [Ferruccio] His name is Paolo. Ten years ago he fled to Brazil. His ID seems to show he's the brother of the guy you're after. The perks of having a friend in the police. [Caino] Good work, Ferruccio. Your name is Ferruccio, right? He who finds a friend, finds a treasure. And if find a friend that's a cop, it's worth double the fortune. Thank you. Goodbye and good luck, Mr. Caino. It's true, isn't it? That all happy families are very similar to each other. But every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. I'm gonna take this, and you bring the pasta. Hopefully they'll have some wine. - [clicking] - What are you doing? Gimme a second. Just in case I bring Rebecca back down with me. Red lights. - [laughs] - I taught you everything. Do you think the bald patch in the middle stands out? You're fine as you are. The more you look, the less you'll like yourself. Wild, right? You have your little hat anyway, don't you? [Ludovico exhales] You know what, Jack? The hat's better like this. Oh, I put something in your bag for the journey. - [Jack] Sounds good. - [Ludovico] It's a surprise. - Hello. - [Ludovico] Hi. For later. [Rebecca] Ah, A Difficult Life. Very difficult. - [laughing] - Come on in. Please tell me that you have wine because we just realized that we ran out. Well, it's okay. I can go back down and get some. No, no, no, no, no. Don't worry. Really. We've got it. We've got plenty. - [Ludovico] Okay. - My jacket? Uh, you can hang it there. - [Jack] Thanks. - On the left. A hanger. - [Ludovico] Can I give you a hand? - [Rebecca] Yes, can you open the wine? - [Ludovico] Can I use this bottle opener? - [Rebecca] Yeah. - [Amanda] Hola. - Hola. Hello. [in Spanish] How are you? - [Ludovico in English] Nice dress. - [Jack] You look great. - [in Spanish] Wanna try the paella? - Okay. - [in English] Did you make it? Yes? - Yes. [laughs] - [exhales] - Mmm! - [Amanda] ¿Caliente? - He's a film director, right? - This is really good. ¡Buena, buena! - [Ludovico chattering] - [Rebecca] I don't like it. - [Ludovico] You don't like the pecorino? [all] Cheers! [Ludovico] To Italian cinema. Did you tell him about your dissertation? No? - [Rebecca laughing] No. - [Jack] Yeah. - [chattering] - [laughing] [Jack] This is sweet. Like really sweet. [laughs] One more. - [in Spanish] Everything. - [Jack] Everything. Everything. - [Rebecca in English] Why don't we toast? - Salud! [all] Cheers! - [chattering] - [laughing] [Jack] The paella, forget it. We have the spaghetti. [laughing] [chattering] [chattering, laughing continue] - [Amanda laughs] - Oh, that's so sweet of her. Well... [in Spanish] I'm sad for you because Seville has the most beautiful girls in Spain. You should come with me. [in English] You know, I pretty sure I don't need to go to Seville. - Ah, no? - No. [laughs, in Spanish] Why? Because the most beautiful girl of all the beautiful girls is... [in English] ...in front of me. [in Spanish] I don't get it. [clicks tongue] No? No. - You get it. - [laughs] [in English] At this point, I should maybe send the comic to a publisher, and... and they should publish it. - That's great! - Well, yeah, it would be really cool. And then, if it happens, maybe I'll put a dedication to you on the front page. The front page... the page where the dedications go. It could be the first, or it could be the last. - Mom, Dad, Rebecca. - Well, thank you. [laughs] No. No problem. Can I ask you a personal question? - Sure thing. - [Rebecca] Hmm? Hmm. [clicks tongue] What's with this beard, huh? [Jack] Because he thinks he's more manly like that. You know, a fragile, insecure personality. [Amanda] Jack is right, you know? [in Spanish] I think a smooth face in a man is, how can I put it? - Very... - Very manly? Yeah. [in English] You take the palabras right out of my mouth, Amanda. [in Spanish] What an idiot! [Jack in English] Have any weed in your apartment? Actually, I don't know if we have any weed leftover. I mean, if we have any, it's in the bathroom. Amanda, go check. - [Amanda chuckles] - Vamos. I'll go with you. [chuckles] [ominous music playing] [Caino] I won't be long. [door closes] [footsteps retreating] - [panting] - [jazz playing] [Amanda exhales] [chuckles] ♪ I've left A long trail of men in my wake... ♪ Interested in seeing something I've never shown anyone? Of course. I have it at my place, if... - Yeah, yeah, of course. Please, get it. - [chuckles] And since you're going, you might as well bring back some weed. If we wait any longer for these two in the bathroom, we'll be here all night. - I'm going. - Oh, wait a second. Don't take too long. Yeah. [mutters] [exhales] [in Spanish] So, you want to take me to live on a Brazilian island where your brother Paolo is. He has a lot of money. But I still don't understand. What do... - [in English] ...you do for a living? - Um, it's a bit difficult to explain. You know, I deal with... [in Spanish] ...apartments, public venues... [in English] ...and banks. Yeah, okay, but what do you do? I mean, are you, like, a bricklayer, an engineer? Uh, I don't know. - An architect? - I'm a thief. - [Amanda] Oh. - [Rebecca] Hmm. [in Spanish] That's why you have this. [in English] If you're so mysterious, it means you must be a cleaning guy. [exhales] Hmm. In a way, you're correct. [inhales] Where's Ludovico? Still downstairs? [exhales] Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was totally drunk. [chuckles] - Maybe he got lost on the stairs. - [Jack] Hmm. - [Rebecca] Come on, go fetch him. - I'll go. If I can find my way. The wine was a bit strong. Brazil. Hey, Ludovico. [chuckles] What other paranoia has come over you now? Look, I... - Hey. - Were you looking for your little friend? [Jack grunts] [coughs] [gasping] [groans] [coughs] [Caino] Go and sit there. [Jack panting] - [grunts] - [Caino] Good boy. Crawl. [Jack grunting] [panting] Leave him alone. He's got fuck-all to do with this. You wanted to go to Brazil with my money just to identify the remains of your junkie brother who was murdered and thrown in the sea. Piece of shit. Don't you dare mention my brother! - [Caino shouts] - [Jack grunts] [panting] Two unfortunate orphans. Both of them faced a brutal end. Actually, we can make it three with this one. I told you. He's got nothing to do with it. You only have to kill me. How generous of you. But he's seen my face already. Really, it's too bad. Dreams die at dawn. [Spartaco] Freeze. - Lower your arm. - [Jack panting] [Spartaco] Slowly. Drop the gun. Now get down on the floor, you worthless piece of shit. [panting] [Caino] Buzzetti was right. I should have ordered him to kill you, not Marzio. - [screaming] - [Ludovico and Jack whimpering] That was for Mario. [groaning] - [gunshot] - [shouting] - That one was for Marzio. - [Caino groaning] I promised him, you know? When you ordered that fucking psychopath to slit his throat like a pig. He'll get what's coming to him soon. - You don't believe in destiny, huh? - [Caino continues groaning] [Spartaco] Well, now I'm your destiny. And believe me when I tell you I'm gonna kill you one piece at a time. It's too bad you only have two knees, Caino. [grunts] I... I can have them reconstructed. But you're not gonna find another brain. [panting] - [gunshot] - [grunts] - [panting] - [coughing] He wanted... He wanted to shoot me in the face, that piece of shit! [gasps] Cut his balls off and stick them in his mouth! He has to be found like that. - Whoever steals from Caino... - [gunshot] - [panting] - [whimpering] - [grunts] - [shouting] - [shouting continues] - [groaning] [panting, groaning continue] [panting, groaning continue] [Jack] Ludovico, hey. [gasping] - [Ludovico groaning] It hurts. - Shh! The ambulance is coming. Yeah, the ambulance is coming. - [sobbing] The ambulance is coming. - It hurts. [sobbing continues] - [Ludovico] It hurts. - [Jack] I know. Okay. - Shh! - [groaning] I'll call the amb... [panting] Help! [sobbing] Help! It's my fault. Shh! Shh! [gasps] Oh! No. [blubbering, sobbing] [groans, gasps] Oh, please, no. [sobbing] [gasps] I'll come back for you. [sobs] I'll come back for you, okay? [groaning] [emotional guitar music playing] [grunting, gasping] [grunts] [siren wailing] [thunder rumbling] [groans] [exhales] [groaning] [whimpers] [whimpers, sniffles] [sniffles] [grunts] [groaning] [man 1] How the fuck do you always manage to speak about politics, huh? [man 2] We're a country of thieves. With tax evasion in the hundreds of billions, you wonder why I bring it up? [man 1] Yeah, but we elect new people to do something about it, didn't we? [man 2] "Italians first." First in what? - We're the first to steal. - [Jack shuddering] [man 2] We're so full of shit. [man1] Yeah, okay, I get it. But come on, gimme a break, man. Jesus fucking Christ! Whoa, who the fuck is this? Hey, come here! [man 2] He must be completely drunk. I think he overdosed. He's in pretty rough shape. [man 2] He's even covered in blood. [Jack gasping] [man] He doesn't look good at all. And what's in here? - This bag is full of money. - [man 2] Is this fake? [man 1] What? Fake? Shit, this is real money. What's this? Just throw this away and take the money. [gasps] - [man 1] Hey, let go! - [man 2] Let go of the bag. Asshole! Go, go, go, go! - [whimpers] - [vehicle doors close] [engine revving] [groaning] [whimpers] [panting] TO MY BIG BROTHER JACK, WHO GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK [thunder rumbling] - [thunder crashes] - [wind blows] [slow-tempo music playing] [man singing in Italian]
