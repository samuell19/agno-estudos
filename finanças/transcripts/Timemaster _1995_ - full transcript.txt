JESSE: Time. I used to think of it as a river stretching from the infinite past to the infinite future. One day, I learned it was more like a rainstorm, drops of it swirling around, and that if you tried, you could run between them. The only problem was, once you started to move through time, you never knew where you were gonna come out. I used to live with my parents and sister just outside of what was once Yellowstone National Park. It wasn't always like this. It used to be green and beautiful. One day, something that couldn't happen... did. The guy that follows the president around with the briefcase that can launch the nukes went totally nutso and pushed the button. My family was deep underground caving at the time. When we came up, this is what we found. Try to remember what it was like, but everyday it gets a little harder. [chain cranking] - Ice cream. - Yeah... ice cream. Cheeseburgers. I miss cheeseburgers. I don't remember cheeseburgers. You remember cheeseburgers, sizzling meat, melted cheese on a toasted bun. Dad used to cook them up on the grill. Oh, yeah. I remember that. But I don't remember what it tasted like. [explosion] [explosion] [goats bleating] VERONICA: Mom! JESSE: Mom. I saw an airplane. Last time it was a boat. Time before that was cowboys and Indians. I saw one, mom. I really did. There aren't any more airplanes, Jesse. [Jonathan shouting] EVELYN: Go! Go! Bandits! Bandits! [people shouting] [horns sounding] [people shouting] Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw! Dad! [hooting and hollering] [people screaming] [screaming] [hooting and hollering] BANDIT: Whoo-hoo! [man yelling] [hooting and hollering] COMMANDO LEADER: For the nuclear event of 2006, Jonathan Adams was a park ranger at some place called Yellowstone National Park. Ex-member of the elite Delta Force. Very skilled. Very dangerous. [people shouting] [grunting] [hooting and hollering] Whoo-hoo! [yelling] [yelling] I'll kill you! Kill you! [people shouting] [screaming] [grunting] - ISAIAH: Sticks and stones. - COMMANDO LEADER: What? ISAIAH: Just something I remembered, sir. Albert Einstein once said that if World War 3 were to be fought with nuclear weapons, World War 4 would be fought with - sticks and stones. - Do it. [gun fires] [explosion] [people shouting] [horse whinnying] CHILD: Mommy! Mommy! JONATHAN: Are you... Who are you? - [laser blasting] - [Jonathan yelling] Dad! - [electrical buzzing] - [Jesse screaming] - [laser blasting] - [Veronica screaming] What'd you do that for? Cool it. The chairman wants her too. Why would he want her? Who knows? Maybe he wants to use her to promotion. Maybe he wants to strip her memory and let her fight her husband. Maybe he wants to make her a contestant. Ours is not to question. Ours is to collect. Once they've cooled down, load Jonathan and Evelyn into the transporter. What about the children, sir? What about them? CHAIRMAN: The thrill of victory. The agony of defeat. The prize... eternal life. The penalty... death. Evelyn's pawn, Jonathan Adams, has captured Mordor's Pa Barker, and is about to lead him up the gallows' steps. If he succeeds... just like his pawn, Mordor will be strapped into the chair and the life sucked out of him right before your eyes. But... as the great Yogi once said... "It ain't over till it's over." And I am sure Mordor still has a few tricks up his sleeve. Let the games begin. [crowd cheering] PREACHER: "And also, that every man should eat "and drink and enjoy the good of all his labors. It is that "gift of God. "To everything, there is a season "and a time to every purpose under the Heaven." It's time. [snickering] [belches] [people talking] [horse whinnying] PREACHER: "A time to be born, and a time to die. "A time to plant, and a time to pluck up "that which is planted. "A time to kill, and a time to heal. "A time to break down, and a time to build up. "A time to weep... "A time to mourn... "A time to cast away stones, and a time to "gather stones together. "A time to..." [Preacher continues reading] [moaning in pain] PREACHER: "A time to love, and a time to hate. "A time for war..." [crowd shouting] CROWDMEMBER: When they call you up, ready to die, boy? [crowd shouting] [Preacher continues reading] PREACHER: "From the beginning to the end..." [crowd shouts outside] [crowd shouting] [horse whinnying] PREACHER: "I saw under the sun "the place of judgment, that wickedness was there. "And the place of righteousness..." PREACHER: "I say to myself, 'the Lord shall judge the righteous "and the wicked." [crowd shouting] PREACHER: "For every purpose under Heaven... "A time to weep, and a time to laugh. "A time to mourn, and a time to dance." Any last word? [grunts] [spits] By the power vested in me by Judge Honorable Roy Bean... I hearby carry out this sentence. May God have mercy on your soul. - [explosion] - [people screaming] [crowd cheering] [explosion] [explosion] [horse whinnying] - [gun firing] - [man screaming] - [gun firing] - [man groaning] [crowd cheering] [guns firing] [moaning] Dad! Run, Jesse! ANNOUNCER: This round will end in ten seconds. PA BARKER: First... [laughs] I'm gonna kill your pa. Then I'm gonna kill you. - [gun firing] - [yelling] Hut! Hut! Come on! [people shouting] Dad! [crowd cheering] So, Howard, what about that fantastic comeback by Mordor - and what about that kid? - What about that kid. You can say that again. - What about that kid? - What about that kid? [screaming triumphantly] HOWARD: What about Mordor? Outgunned four-to-one. Turned a very dangerous situation around with a little help from his friends. And how about the kid? He never did get to execute the coup de grace. Well, let's take a look at that move one more time from Mordor. I think this was critical. It was Mordor's pawn that was freed but it was Evelyn's Jonathan that was out and about. HOWARD: Wow, now that's what I call a block. You know, Howard, we tend to forget that this is a team sport. I know for a fact that Mordor's pawn is one tough customer. But without everybody's help, he's not going to score points. I hope some of the younger viewers out there have learned a lesson from what they've just seen. - Learned a lesson? - Yeah, like everybody - can't be a superstar! - But everybody can be important! Whoop. Wait a minute. - We've just got a special bulletin. - Oh, no. [static] MAN ON TV: We'll return to your favorite announcers, Bob and Howard, in the arena in a moment. But first, we'd like to remind you that immediately following tonight's telecast, we'll be playing that movie classic "Casablanca," starring any actor or actress you want. Punch in your choice, sit back and enjoy. And now back to Bob and Howard at the arena. BOB: Evelyn's pawn, Jonathan Adams, is still alive. He's badly wounded, and without modern medicines, it's doubtful he'll make it. But until he dies, Evelyn won't be strapped into the chair. Stay tuned, tomorrow's gonna be another exciting one. [TV switching off] MISS SPINELL: Jesse... The, uh... Leecocks have decided to take you. They'll be by tomorrow - morning. - What about Veronica? Leecocks don't want a daughter. They want a son. - But she's my sister. - MISS SPINELL: I've told you many times. We can't always find parents who are willing to take siblings. JESSE: They won't take both of us, then I'm not going. Jesse... Your grandfather's insurance is about to run out. If you don't go with the Leecocks, we're going to send you and your sister to a state institution. [crickets chirping] [breathing hard] [exhaling] [glass breaking] Jesse. - I have to run away. - Why? Because... they want me to go off with parents who won't take you. I'm not gonna do it. They don't want me? JESSE: Oh, Veronica... They're no good. I'm going to get some money so we can live together. - I'm gonna look for our real parents. - I think our real parents are dead, Jesse. JESSE: I don't know. I think they are. - I've seen them. - You've seen them? - In dreams. - Yeah, I've seen them too. - Keep this hidden. - Why do I need it, Jesse? To buy yourself treats when I'm gone. - Will you be gone long? - No. I don't... No. If you're going to be outside, I think you'll need this. - I can't take your cowboy hat. - I think you'll need it. - I love you, Veronica. - I love you. I'll be back soon. Go to sleep. - Jesse? - Yes, sweetie? Say goodbye to Ninny. Goodbye, Ninny. [crickets chirping] You said that you were going to quit smoking. You said that you were going to stop sneaking into town. I'm not sneaking into town. I'm running away to find my parents. Jesse, come along, I'd like to share something with you. Don't touch that. It doesn't say you have to line up 74, 238 dominoes all by yourself to get the record. You're quite right. But I'm not simply going for a record. I'm going for two records, the longest chain and the longest chain ever by a single person. [chuckling] [dominoes falling] [whimpers] [whimpering] [whimpering] [bell rings] [whimpers] [whimpering] I'm sorry. Why couldn't you have stayed in bed like all the other good little boys! I told you, I'm running away to find my parents. - Your parents are dead. - My parents aren't dead. I've seen them. - You told me that was a dream. - It had to be a dream because we were all in the Wild West, and that's not possible. It had to be a vision, a dream. [chuckles] A vision... "All of life itself is a vision. "Nothing exists, 'tis only dream. "All. "God, man, the world, the sun, the moon, the wilderness of "stars. 'Tis all a dream. Nothing exists, save space... "And you." Who said that? Mark Twain. - Mark Twain? - [Isaiah chuckles] What, you think he only wrote about nice little boys who painted fences and rescued slaves? You know how he ended that thought, the very last thought that he ever wrote down? "There is no God. "No human race, no earthly life. No Heaven, no Hell. "'Tis all a dream... "A foolish and grotesque dream. Nothing exists, but you and you "are but a thought, a vagrant thought. "A useless thought. "A homeless thought wandering among the empty eternities." He was wrong. Indeed. How could you possibly know? Well... I think therefore I am. And you think therefore you are too. Perhaps. Perhaps not. JESSE: Oh my God. I've been there. I knew I wasn't crazy. Jesse boy, your parents are not dead, but they are in very grave danger. And hopefully, I can teach you how to help them. Come along. I don't see anything. Look with your heart, not your eyes. [wall breathing] How did you... Can I.... Who are you? Well... I used to work for the people who are trying to kill your parents. But I quit. Now, I choose to look after you. - JESSE: Come with me. - ISAIAH: No, no. There are some things one must do for oneself. Look for me around corners. - I'll be there. - [pats Jesse's back] [electricity zapping] Woah. [planet whooshing past] - [explosions] - [historical voice talking] - [clarinet playing] - [historical voices talking] ELVIS: Thank you. Thank you very much. [historical voices continue] [explosion] MARILYN MONROE:... Birthday, Mr. President. JFK: And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country. - [zapping sound] - [Jesse gasping] - [explosion] - [Jesse yells] - [explosions] - [deep rumbling] - [explosion] - JESSE: Whoa! [Jesse screaming] [T-Rex roaring] [Jesse yells] [satellite beeping] [T-Rex roars] [Jesse grunts] [T-Rex roars] [satellite crunching] [Jesse grunts] [T-Rex growling] [Jesse screaming] [chickens clucking] Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil found with the remains of communication satellite in stomach. Film at 11:00. What's film? - Hi. - Hi. What's wrong, Jesse? You seem strange. You were screaming strange things... "Film at 11:00?" Film, you know, movies? Movies. Terminator 2, Wayne's World, Back to the Future. Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Jurassic Park. Don't be afraid. Look, I'll show you. [chickens clucking] - That's Magic. - That's not magic, that's movies. EVELYN: Jesse? Jesse? - Come quick. - Uh, I better go. Excuse me. Jesse... your daddy's dying. So, if you wanna see anyone, come in. [Jonathan shivering] The door! Please close. Hold me! Hold me! Susie. - Who's Susie? - I'm Susie. - Oh, but I never... - PREACHER: Hush! He is confessing his sins. Eyes full of adultery. A heart that had exercised covetous practices. Renounce the Devil! Cast him out, or you will forever burn in the fires of Hell! And stop talking in the Devil's tongue! He's not talking in the Devil's tongue. He's delirious from fever. We've got to get him into a cold bath. We've gotta lance his wound, and bleed it with alcohol and soap. And we've got to get some antibiotics into him. The child is speaking in the Devil's tongue. "Blessed are ye when men hate and fear you "for speaking the truth." I've come a long way to see my dad, and I'm not going to let him die just because some bozo's more interested in spouting bullshit than trying to keep him alive! Blasphemer! Get down on your knees. Beg forgiveness. Confess your sins. You don't help me get him into a cold bath, you're the one who's gonna have to get down on your knees and beg forgiveness. Come on. Help me. PREACHER: "And the woman was arrayed in purple..." What were you saying about those, uh... bio-tecs? Antibiotics. You know, they kill bacteria. - Bacteria. - Bacteria. Microscopic organisms. They cause infection. Where do you get these, uh... Where do you get these antibiotics? From your drugstore. I mean, from the mold. It grows in the water. On the basin, you could farm it. PREACHER: "And I saw the woman..." Drugstore, huh? PREACHER: "And with the blood on the martyrs of Jesus. "And when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration "Then the angel said unto me..." [crickets chirping] Hi, mom. Jesse... I don't know how you knew what to do but I'm really glad you did. Dad. Is he woken up yet? No. He's resting peacefully. But his fever, is that what you call it? It's less. - Do you think Susan... - No, Ma. Those are just words. They didn't mean anything. You should go to sleep. I'll wake you when your dad wakes up. [knocking] Let's go. Go? Where? What do you mean "where," it's Saturday night. Every Saturday night, we sneak into town. [people talking] ["Buffalo Gals" playing] [crowd talking] MAN: Come on. ["Can-Can" playing] MAN: And stay out! [hooting and hollering] [hooting and hollering] [glass breaking] [man screaming] I raise ya fifths. Hell, see ya. COWBOY: Read em and weep. [chuckles] Two eight of clubs can only mean one thing. CARD PLAYER: It's... probably my fault. Maybe when I shuffled the game before last I combined two decks. I don't think it happened that way. Are you calling me a liar? Yeah. [sighs and swallows] You're the one who shot my father. BILLY: Your brother's the one who shot his. - Who the hell are you? - Billy. What business of this is yours? [chuckles] Oh, it's not. I got nothing against blowing up banks. I draw a line at threatening kids who cheat at cards. Freeze! Hands in the air, bend over, touch the tables spread your legs, spread your fingers, assume the position. Read him his rights. I mean, if he moves, shoot him. [chuckles] BILLY: Not only are you a cheat... but your brother's a coward. Time for you to step outside, kid. [crowd talking] You're wearing your gun on the wrong side. For you to reach your gun, you've got to reach down bend your elbow, pull it out of the holster in an awkward way and then straighten it out. You're the one who invented the cross-draw. You put your gun on your left hip, butt out, and drew in one smooth motion. It's much quicker. You never lost. [chuckles] You been smoking locoweed? No, it's like the two-handed tennis grip the cross-country skiing skating step, the slam dunk. There's a better way. You invented it. I invented it. Yeah. Kinda like that. SPECTATOR: Oh, here he comes. - [crowd talking] - SPECTATOR: Don't let him scare ya. SPECTATOR: Stand calm, man. SPECTATOR: Come on, Billy! SPECTATOR: He's kinda cute! You don't have to stand there, you know. He's not even going to get off one shot. [thunder crackling] [gun firing] [crowd cheering] SPECTATOR: Did you see that? SPECTATOR: Yay, Billy! [crowd hooting and hollering] Watch out for Pat Garrett, Billy. He's the only one who got them right. Thanks, kid. I'll remember that. Dad? Have you ever found yourself in a place that you know you can't be? Your mom was teaching me to read. She showed me a book about ancient history, The picture... called The Siege of Jericho... The attackers were using something called a... catapult. Had a long, wooden arm attached to a spring that, uh... threw rocks through the air. Now, when I saw that picture... I knew I had been in a battle where one of those had been used. Anyway, your mom didn't want to talk about it. She, um... She knew that I knew. She had been there, too. She told me what you did. You saved my life. I think I would've died if you hadn't come back. Oh, dad. Maybe it's good that I'm back. Maybe I should stay. JONATHAN: I think if you can find out where we should all be... you should try to do it. I'm glad you came back. I want you to keep going. What do you mean "came back?" Wasn't I always here? Well... someone was here. I don't think it was you. Dad, where's Veronica? Your sister died last year. She got hot like me and died. [church bell ringing] [crickets chirping] If I had been here, I could have saved her. But you were here, Jesse. That wasn't exactly me. Isaiah calls it parallel time. I'm Jesse but from another place. Another time. Well, if that's true, then there's nothing you could have done. Come on. - ANNIE: Did you come from outer space? - JESSE: I didn't come from outer space. - JESSE: I came from California. - ANNIE: I think you came from outer space. JESSE: I didn't come from outer space. I came from the future. - ANNIE: Why did you come here? - JESSE: I was an orphan. JESSE: Even though I lived in the future, I kept seeing my parents in the past. - Here in this town. - How'd you get here? Isaiah showed me how. I really wanted to see my parents. But now that I'm here, I really miss where I came from and I miss my sister. You have to be careful about what you wish for. But it's not all that bad. You got to meet me. I think I like this Jesse better than the one I used to. [water splashes] I never promised you that you'd be happy with what you'd find. I simply wanted to show you how to get there. Then why do you sound so guilty? Because I am. ISAIAH: You see, Jesse, traveling through the cracks of time is like traveling through a maze. You can't get to where you want to in a straight line. Where I want to go, or where you want me to go? Both. No, no, actually the way you have to get to. Beyond this entire universe is the planet from which I come. Eons ago, we discovered how to put together computers machinery and DNA. And then we invented transformers that could pass for anything, except that we could control them. And then we'd send them flying off through the universe with people like me aboard to come and visit planets like yours. It's fascinating how one small moment could change an entire history. We control the gun that was used in an assassination attempt on Hitler in 1938. Can you imagine what might have happened if we hadn't caused that gun to misfire? - Why would you do that? - Well, I don't know... for sport, for entertainment, for something to bet on. That's pretty sick. Yes, of course. Um, Jesse, I'd like to paint you a bit of a picture. You see, for decades and decades, I lived in basements and I had to take charge of other people's garbage and do menial tasks and that sort of thing. And all the while people would look right through me, as though I were non-existent. You're the only one who ever even bothered to ask me anything other than... when could I fix the radiator in 302? Well, what about my toilet leak in 1412? [chuckles] And all the while, people were laughing. They were just pieces on an enormous chessboard. Nothing was real. However, I did enjoy traveling through the cracks in time and one crack in particular, would always bring me to New York City. Thanksgiving Day, what a wonderful holiday with parades and family fare and food and festivities and people gambling on football games in the bars. That wondrous aroma of autumn leaves in Central Park. [chuckling] The last time I traveled through that crack to get there was Thanksgiving Day, the year, 2006. Then when I got there there was no there. It was ruin and rubble and radiation. And that's when I decided that was how this particular game was going to end. And indeed until you came along, I couldn't have cared less. What are you going to do now? I'd like to try and show you how to change the future. Not the past and present but the future. Come along. Alright, you two. This is where you say goodbye to each other. I'm going with him. You can't go with him. This is your world. You must stay in it. [horse whinnying] If Jesse's going, then I'm going. There's something you must know when you set off to travel through time. Once you set foot through those doors, nothing again will ever be the same. What may appear to you to be as miniscule as a second could be a year, perhaps two, for those you leave behind. And those you leave behind will change and not necessarily be there for you if indeed you should return. What about my sister? Well... You saw what happened to her because you couldn't get back in time. The same thing could happen if you don't get back to exactly where you left Annie. Do you want me to come with you, Jesse? Yeah. I do. Let's go. Da-da-da-dit. One small problem here. You don't have an air tank. We'll share. [thunder crackling] [lightning striking] NEIL ARMSTRONG: Gonna step off the LM now. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. - [plane flying] - [historical voices speaking] AMELIA EARHART: ...modern invention. And that with which I am most concerned is of course air transportation. Flying is perhaps the most dramatic... [historical voices continue] MAN: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. And lift off. - And lift off... - [rocket engines blasting] MAN: Rock 'n' roll, gentlemen. [historical voices continue] MAN: Challenger now heading down range. Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction. [explosions] - MAN: We have no downlink. - [electricity zapping] We have a report from the flight dynamics officer that the vehicle has exploded. Flight director confirms that we are looking at checking with the recovery forces to see what can be done at this point. [electricity zapping] [explosions] ISAIAH: Whoo! [clears throat] The next crack in time should take us to the end of the universe. And it'll open up in the middle of all of this in about two hours, so I suggest we simply stay put. Where are we? This is Tombstone, Arizona. May the fifth, the year 2006. What are these things? These were your tax dollars at work. [chuckles] The world war fleets. They were built to kill people. Oh, I don't think they look like they could kill anybody. Maybe this thing over here could chop your head off. JESSE: They used to fly. They carried bombs, big bombs. Bombs so big, we could destroy the entire world burn down all of the cities and send you back to the Stone Age. - But why would people do that? - I don't know, but they did. I was there, or was that a dream? No, it wasn't a dream. It happened. But you see, if we could travel back to where just before it happened, perhaps we could prevent it from happening at all. I tell you what, I've changed my mind. Come along. I'll buy you two a cheeseburger and a milk. How did it go? COMMANDO: We ran a simulation of the last moments of planet Earth. Our top game master made it to the White House kitchen. But he didn't make it past the little transformers that we had hidden there. After they had killed him, one of the transformers was able to punch in the launch code. This is an exact replica of the briefcase carried by the naval officer who accompanies the president. I have to go back to Earth. I have to plant the transformers. How glorious it's going to be, thermonuclear destruction of Earth will make quite a spectacle. The betting will be enormous. Take in huge amounts of Blue. We will live forever. Or at least some of us will Isaiah is time traveling again. And this time he is travelling towards us. He also has Jonathan's son, Jesse, with him and that girl from the Wild West. Revenge of the pawns. Programmers predicted this might happen. Stop them... forever. [rock music playing] I hope they stop somewhere long enough to get a driver's license. ISAIAH: [chuckles] Attaboy. [car engine running[ [rock music playing] Two cheeseburgers and two glasses of milk, please. Aren't you supposed to be in school, kid? ISAIAH: Um, it's alright. I'm his teacher. We're on a class trip. - [country music playing] - BIKER: Hey! [Annie gasps] [glass breaks] JESSE: She's sorry. She's not from around here. - She didn't mean to do it. - [Biker growls] Leave the kid alone. [gasps] Ah, shit! - Veronica? - How do you know me? - Who are you? - I'm Jesse. JESSE: My god, you grew up. Never tell me what to do! - [screeches] - [glass breaks] Now, runt, you owe me a beer and a dry cleaning! - [Jesse grunts] - [Biker moans in pain] Are you alright, sweetie? - Who's she? - She's my sister. Oh... COMMANDO: Isaiah, long time, no see. Jesse, Annie, time to come home. Look, yuppie, you got off at the wrong exit. After I take care of that bozo, I'm going to teach those kids a real lesson! I don't think it's going to turn out that way. - [Biker squealing in pain] - [Commando grunting] Run! [people grunting and yelling] - [glass breaking] - [man yelling] - [gasping] - Come on! [train whistle blowing] Make a left! [train whistle blowing] Are you nuts? If we don't get away from these guys and make it into the junkyard in five minutes, something terrible is gonna happen. This is crazy. You cannot be Jesse. Jesse is older than me. This is some kind of a sick dream, that's what this is. This is some kind of a nightmare. I know it doesn't make sense, but it's not a dream. You said that you would come back for me, Jesse and you didn't come back. I did come back. The timing's messed up, that's all. But I'll fix it. Isaiah, tell her. Ah, Jesse. Jesse, the crack in the junkyard is going to close imminently. And if we're not through it, they're gonna shut down this game destroy the world, and we're gonna be on it. Now come on! - JESSE: Come on. - No. I am gonna wake up, and you are gonna come back for me. You are not gonna let them throw me out into the street. JESSE: Oh my god. [motorcycle vrooms] Jesse! [electricity zapping] [explosion] ISAIAH: Come on, kids. [Isaiah grunts] [tires screeching] ISAIAH: Annie! ISAIAH: Hey! [exploding] [propellers whirring] COMMANDO: Go, go, go! Go stop them! [electricity zapping] Whoa. [Annie grunts] - [explosion] - [man screaming] Grab this! Inside. [electricity zapping] Jesse! Jesse! [electricity zapping] Come on, Jesse! Hurry up! - JESSE: Veronica, come on! - ISAIAH: In! ISAIAH: Get in! VERONICA: Jesse! Jesse, don't leave me! Jesse! - Jesse, don't leave me, Jesse! - JESSE: Come on! Come on! - Jesse! Jesse! - [screams] Veronica! JESSE: Veronica! [fizzing] [fire blazing] [steaming] JESSE: Oh my God. - Does that mean that... - That... thermonuclear warfare melted the polar ice caps and flooded the world as you knew it. Let me try and put it the way Albert Einstein did... "For those of us who believe in physics... "the separation between past, present and future "is but an illusion." What you see happened... But it doesn't mean that it happened yet nor that it can't be prevented. JESSE: What made the flowers grow so fast? ISAIAH: It's what this is all about. It's called Life Extender. - JESSE: Life Extender? - ISAIAH: Yes, it's a... very rare blue liquid that can stop, even reverse aging. The only problem with it is once you start taking it you can't quit. Otherwise, you will turn to dust and age before your very own eyes. Isaiah's in the building. You'll see people betting everything on it. They must win. They have to have it. I've seen them rip apart their own skin, searching for the Blue even as they started to turn to dust. They couldn't care less about the various little worlds they'll be betting on. JESSE: How could they be like that? - We're people just like them. - ISAIAH: [chuckles] No, you're not. To them, you are a chess piece, a pawn, little blip on a video screen bits and pieces of virtual reality. You don't exist. We exist. I know you do, son. Now, all you gotta do is prove it to them. [hip music playing] - Blue. I want that Blue. - How old are you, pops? 24. I'll be 24 next month. How much Life Extender do you have, son? Four months. And I want to bet it all. BETTING CLERK: You're 24? You look like you're 102. You have four months of Blue, and you want to bet it all? [liquid pouring] [device beeping] BETTING CLERK: Who do you want, pops? Eve. I wanna bet Eve. [device beeping] Good luck. At least he bet on your mom. - [hip music playing] - [people talking] Oh my god... it's my mom. Wait till you see your dad. CHAIRMAN: Let the games begin. [crowd cheering] You have offended my family. You have offended the Shaolin Temple. - [crowd cheering] - [device beeping] Hee-ya! [both grunting] [yelling] [fighters grunting] [yelling] [crowd cheering] [screaming] [both grunting] [yelling] [crowd cheering] [grunting] [yelling] [grunting] [crowd cheering] [yelling] Yeah! [crowd cheering] [both grunting] [creature yelling] [crowd cheering] [yelling] [both grunting] [Jonathan yelling] [yelling] [explosion] [electric zapping] [crowd chanting] [Mordor screaming] - [crowd chanting] - [Mordor screaming] [liquid bubbling] [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] [Jesse gasps] - JESSE: Please stop. - ANNIE: Hey! They say that you can see the future in a child's eyes. Let's see if that's true. Behind those three paintings are three cracks. One leads to your father. One leads to your sister, and one leads to the kitchen of the White House, early Thanksgiving morning in the year 2006. Now, we're gonna play the game in a little while. And if you win... I'll allow you to walk through whichever crack you want. If I go through the crack that leads to the White House Kitchen will I be able to stop what you set up? That's up to you. ISAIAH: Chairman, sir, let them go. Send them all back to where or when they came from. CHAIRMAN: Is that what you want, Jesse... to go back before this all began? I'm gonna stop what you've set in motion. Even if you could stop me, what's to say I wouldn't do it again? No... Thermonuclear destruction would make quite a spectacle to watch and bet on from the comfort and safety of the arena. He's bluffing, Jesse. He can't control the cracks. However, you must bear in mind that once these do close... another may not come to your world again for hundreds of years. Is that what you want, Jesse? Do you want to go home or bet on yourself? Knowing that if you lose, I will strap you into a chair and then suck the life out of you. Let's do it. That's mine! Get away! Get away! [devices beeping] [people talking] [device beeping] [woman screams] - [bazooka blasting] - [missile screeching] - [explosion] - [screaming] [crowd screaming] [bottles breaking] [Jonathan yells] [laughing] Whoo! [grunting in pain] [yelling] I'm gonna kill ya! [yelling] [screaming] [Skier yells] [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun firing] [machine gun firing] [explosion] - [machine gun firing] - [explosions] [church bell ringing] That moves to another crack that leads to a pawn. Do you want me to send someone after her? JONATHAN: Whatever this is... I hope it's over. I know that I have to wake up... but I never do. But I know somehow that I'm not dreaming. But I keep hoping that I am because... well, it must be... that someday, somehow, I'll wake up. Do you know what it's like to bounce from one nightmare to another? To be scared... No one to turn to because... what you know is happening... can't be happening. So, it's not happening. But it is. The only person that's not trying to kill you is... only a face I sometimes see when I look up into the sky. [water flowing] So, if you can't be real... but now she's standing right in front of me. It's over. I'm real. Actual. I'm real. How touching. They'll have at least nine months to get to know each other before I destroy their pathetic little planet. You're a big talker. I wonder how funny you'd be if you knew you'd be strapped into the chair, like everyone else who loses. You made a deal. Let's go. You saved my life. - Take it. - No. Are you crazy? It's valuable. Not where I'm going. It's beautiful... looks like life. If you stop taking it, looks like death. That's the gun that Billy the Kid used. Where'd you get it? I found it in a little store in Aspen, Colorado on my travels. - Aren't you coming with us? - No. I can't. I'm... addicted to Blue. If I don't get some soon, I'm going to die. Oh, Isaiah... I'm sorry. Wish me luck. Bet on me. [electric zapping] [electric zapping] - CHEF: Morning. - MAN: Good morning. CHEF: Yow know, the last president to tell me that the thing he was most going to enjoy about no longer being president of never having to see that guy with the Attache case chained to his wrist, holding the nuclear launch codes. Now, how does that make you feel? Hungry. Alright, I'll fix you some breakfast. [handcuffs clanking] - [steaming] - [kitchenware clanking] - [explosion] - [Chef yelling] [whisk whirling] [grunting in pain] - [blades whirring] - [electricity zapping] - [explosions] - [blades whirring] [electricity zapping] [buttons beeping] - [buttons beeping] - [electricity zapping] [gun firing] - [gun firing] - [exploding] Freeze! AIDE: Jesse. The new headmaster wants to see you. [Miss Spinell grunts] I knew you'd come back, Jesse. HEADMASTER: Miss Spinell was arrested because she did something terrible. She was taking money to place children. In fact, the couple that was gonna take you was arrested as well. They were part of a ring. So, Jesse, nobody is going to separate you from your sister. In fact, you both can stay here as long as you want until we find a couple that wants to adopt both of you. Ok? ANNIE: Dad, can I go outside and play? HEADMASTER: That's my daughter, Annie. Annie, this is Jesse and his sister, Veronica. Hi. Hi. [birds chirping] ISAIAH: Jesse boy, if you can read this, I guess it means people will be watching football in that little bar on 48th and Broadway on Thanksgiving Day, 2006. Never forget what Albert Einstein said: "For those of us who believe in physics, the separation "between past, present, and future is only an illusion." Look for me around corners. I'll be there. Brother Isaiah.
