Sub a di! Sub a di! Sub a di! Suta. That hurts. This will heal you. Chew This. You will feel better. Suta! Omi! Thank you Papa. I made a good trade. Thank you Tak-tek. Where is Goben? Aaaahh! Is this the termite that took your eye? All the same to me. Aaaaaahhh!! Where are the others and the village? Where village? [Growl}. Where village? Rock men!, Rock Men have attacked! The old ones? Where? The orchard! They attacked as we worked. This medicine stone to make you strong. Goben is here. He says Rock-Men are coming. Omi take Chi-Cha Home. Umhm. Stay there. Father! Goben! You're ok. KayLay and Gelling, everyone was taken. We need to go after them. We cannot fight the rock men. The Giants can fight, we can ask them for help. We have no contact with Giants and Don't want it! They are dangerous. Goben is right. Listen Please! We must leave home now. We must hide in the jungle. Take what you own and go! What is that? Rock Men!! Walk Chi Cha, Walk! No!, No! Omi! My Omi! Tak-Tek Find Omi! I Will take mother to the field. Noooo! I will find Omi. You! Find the rat who took Gar's eye! Omi! Papa! Omi. Tak-Tek! Father! Suta! We Go We GO! Leave us alone! Give up now termites! Back to hell monster. You! You hurt Gar! Suta! Tak-Tek. Mother! Mother! Tak-Tek. Mother! Mother! Suta! We have to save mama! One of her medicine stones. She calls for us to go after her. We must help her papa. She would do the same for us. I must keep you safe. We must go! Those stones will not save you. They are for Tak-Tek, he will follow, I know he will. I think we lost them. Good. Look for the next stone. Another stone. That's 7. He's our village, and here is where we found the new stone. The stones are leading us there. Those mountains, that is where the rock men go. We must cross the grasslands, home of the giants. The giants. Yes, the home of the giants. They are more dangerous than the rock men. They both kill, but we have no choice. Where are we? Send them to the boiling room. Stop! Poison trees. Is there another way around? No. We must cover ourselves, then we can run throught the bushes safely. I'll build a decoy. Another stone! Aaarrgg! Now! Through the bushes. There! Aaargh. What is this termiite trick? You go through! Vines very bad, you go first. You are weak! Gar! Get out! Aaaaahhhh! That will teach the rock men Papa! Be humble Goben, earth made the poison vines, not you. C'mon. I do not know these lands, some plants are strange. Look Papa! These are not by rock men. No, giants... Omi! This is a place of worship for the Giants. We must leave. Leave it. It's not for us. That could be changed. See! Your arms are too small. It needs the helping stick. You see papa, earth mother provides, I create. Just like you. Lets go. My helping stick can be used for many things. It can throw, it can lift, and it can reach where a hand cannot. For tree people, our greatest skill... Is quiet! Go! Go! Go! Papa! Stay down. Earth mother saves us. They are giants. But they look jusrt like us. They are not like us, they kill, they hunt animals to eat. They think not of earth mother. Look... how strong... they are. We must ask them to help us. Papa Please. What intruders are these? Speak children! Who are you? We are not children. You speak common tongue well, half man. We have watched your people and listened. We are tree people. Tree-People? I thought they were a myth. I think not but clearly the rumors are true that they can blend into the grass and become invisible. Teach us how to become invisible. I will teach you how to take out an eye. Goben No! Hold your weapon Varm. These half-men... and woman... are not in a very good humor this day and besides, THAT one saved my life. You have done me a great service half-man. I am in your debt. I am Amthar, master of the hunt. These are my companions, Varman and Pesh. I am Tak-Tek, these are my children Omi and Goben. How can I repay you? Help us please. Help you? Our people were taken by Rock-Men. My mother was taken. They are in those mountains, please help us. These half men seek a service from me. Should I accommodate them? What think you my friends? As you said, you do owe him the services. My Cheif Korm is the ruler of these lands. HE must make the decision... and as much as it pains me, I must bring you before him so he could answer your request. My great cheif Korm. What are these... Little things... you bring before us? These are half-men are jungle people. They saved my life and seek safe passage through our land as repayment. They wish to rescue their kin from the clutches of the Rock men. Rock men are an evil enemy. But we have been at peace for many, many seasons. We do not bother them and they do not bother us. Please let us pass, so we can save our people. Your kin are beyond hope. Leave them to their deaths. My great cheif... You would speaak agaist your kin? I seek only to aid their quest as repayment for my life debt. So you may die as well? And for strangers no less. These strangers saved my life. Varm and Pesh and I would gladly join their fight. A fight that is not ours. That would start awar with the Rock-Men, cost the lives of our finest hunters... Great Cheif... Better the meat of half men than stealing OUR babies for their cookpits. We should do NOTHING! We must do something! I am your chief and I will NOT allow it! Great chief Kormm, what about a trade. What could you possibly have, tree man, that I could want? My daughter is a medicine woman, she can teach you how to plant seed. Onions Cabbage and rice. What? Us? You would have us eat plants? We are humans, rulers of the plains! There are plenty of animals for all eternity. I have no interested in your seeds. I have other tools for digging and cracking nuts! Maybe there is a tool to make you taller. Let the half-man speak! Make him show us something we can use. Papa! Wait, one more, my son goben, can help you throw your spears far. Now this I would like to see. It is true, with my helping stick, you will throw one far. Alright then, Show me. Who is your best spear thrower? Amthar. Stand aside. This will be a mighty toss. Indeed that is a mighty toss. But let not a man, even the best among us, claim to do what THIS woman does better. Who is not as good? Varm, your little brother Pesh is right for that. If he has the strength. Give him your smallest spear. Pesh gets a child's spear. Don't make a fool of me half man. I will not pesh, let the helping stick do the work. A trade for safe passage please? It is a mighty gift. And we could make more, to aid us in both battle and hunt. A true king would do this right thing. And what do you know of true kingship, one who could help... little people with useless toys. What? I will not start a war Rock-Men and waste our human blood for tree people. Don't think to disobey me Amthar. This is not honorable. Honorable... no, perhaps not. But practical. Bind the half men, we will leave them for the Rock men to find when we leave in the morning. What is going to happen? Do what they say and live. Boiling room. Boiling room. No, no, no, no! Boiling room. You are a healer. Yes. I'm am Koto. Slave to Rock-men a long time. But Koto still alive. Move Termites! Let me take this termite. Yes. Take her. Enjoy her... hahaha. Stay with Koto. I teach you how not to die. The rope is so tight. Keep trying! Suta is dead. No papa, she lives. My hand is almost free. Amthar? Sssshhhh... Don't be afraid. Please let my children go. I will do better than that. You saved my life. And I believe that one should always pay their debts. Amthar, Thank you. Thank you. GO! GO! GO! Laylan? Be glad little half-men. We will help you find your kin. Varm and Pesh? They await ahead. Well met Amthar. We are ready. Quickly, into the jungle to the mountain of the Rock-Men. And let swiftness guide our feet. We should be there in a day. Good. Rock-Men do not keep their prisoners for long. Caution is for the weak, yes brother? Only for those with slow feet! One day, Pesh will beat Varm. Brothers will be brothers. Father? I am ok I will catch up. No we must not lose you too. Can yo walk? He will with our help yes. You have your mothers strength. Come Half-men. My kinsmen will be moving swiftly! You tarry too long at each obstacle. And you move too fast, you feet will find what your eyes should see first. Come. Give us time, to rest. Each moment here is a moment lost. The jungle up ahead is thick. I have never seen anything like it before. Can you guide us through them? Yes, remember we have short legs. I think I would have lost the half-men. They are not lost. They know this forest better than we ever will. They are probably swinging through the trees right now. Help! What jungle hell is this? Cut the Vine! No worry bother, I got you! Help! Hang on! Aaahhh! Laylan! A Noskaj! We can't cut the Vine! Get me kokat balm. Omi Quick! Yes Papa. Laylan the children! Almost there! Almost! Amthar, let me lead. This will help. It's already better. Thank You. Omi you are helping us, thank you laylan. I've never told anyone about this before... On a night before the full moon much like tonight, when I was a child, the Rock-Men took my mother and my brother from our village. And they took their lives under the full moon. Now, I thirst for a vengeance that only the last drop of the Rock-Men's blood will quench. And With the Sky Father's help, I intend to take that blood. With the earth mothers healing, it will be easier if you can see. Thank you. She will not be blind for long. Please do not let my injury keep you from your quick ascent. Tonight is the full moon. Full moon? Yes. We hurry because full moon is the time of feasting for the Rock-Men. That is why they took your people, Tak-Tek, your wife. By tonight, every one of them will slaughtered. Bow, bow your head. Thank you. The full moon is tonight. That is why you are here. To worship the moon? No, to be cooked for the feast! Suta, its me Kaylay. Goben's friend. Yes I know you. Gelling is hurt. Please help him. No talk! Geling, its me suta. Does Goben live? He does. Good... when may I see him? Eat this, it will give you strength. Tak-tek must get here soon. The Rock men were here recently. The fire is fresh. They leave a foul stench. I wish I could see more clearly. You would not like what we see. Kam-Chee, he was a gardener. The rock men are beasts. Earth mother, watch over your sleeping child. LayLan! Wait here! [{Groans] I could have killed him, but I though he might be useful. Keep him away from me. Where are the rest of the tree people? Do the tree-people still live? Are they at the mountain? There is no peace for beast men. This is crazy! Do not fear half man. I will protect you. No... NO! Watch over pesh earth mother. Sky father and earth monther. Look over young Pesh. We may all join him soon enough. You eat now. No Raykah! It's flesh! I know. I'm hungry. We must eat. Where do you think that's from? Suta! Something has happened. Rock-men chase tree people in jungle. They are very angry Come with me! Go ahead Suta. Go. I will stay. We found them, then they got away. Idiot! Aaarrgg! He chased tree people. They got away. They were following magic rocks. Tak-tek! Idiots! All Idiots! The rocks lead to here. Javas are very angry. This is not good. Think you... saved. Never! NEVER! Poisonous Komodos. See the red stripe upon their backs? These beasts have venom. I have nothing more to fear. Nor I. But what good comes to perish in this battle and leave the little ones to fend for themselves? I would rather die with a pile of ROCK MEN corpses at my feet than these wretched lizards. They may not sleep long. We must hurry. Laylan, Varm, take one of the little ones each, I will protect Omi. Are you hurt... little one? No are you? We must find your father. You've been bitten. It is not... so deep. The poison has to come out. You must... save... your family. Amthar. Are you OK? I will be fine. Keep Awake. Omi, Can your medicine save him? Yes. Then we must find somewhere safe. We must find safety. I must find suta. Papa, we are so close to the lair. Goben, I must go alone, stay with your sister. He has the fever, do you know bram-fruit leaves? Yes. Get some, make tea, and I need a hot stone. I will make a fire with no smoke. I... I am... sorry. SSHHHH we will care for you. Suta! I cannot let you go alone papa. My son my couragous son! Raykah, we must find another way! I shall go ahead. Stay here and draw the map as I whistle directions. Yes Papa. Good Son, Good. They are going to eat us. Sssshhh! They are going to eat us. They are going to eat us. Do not lose hope! There is no hope! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Stupid pet. Give her to the moon god now! Raykah no! Nnnnnoo... nnoo! No! Let go! Let go! Gorram! Down! Down Termite. Moon God, accept this sacrifice. Gorram! Bak-Do. Tek-Tek, you are alive. Yes, bak-do, does suta live? Not for long. We need to set booby traps for the rock men. I understand. You must stay awake Amthar. I am fine. Truly. Are the rocks ready? Almost. It is a claw from one of the lizards. I have cleaned it. Thank you. I'm sorry This will hurt. I'll go find Tak-Tek and Goben. The poison sack is not broken. The hour has come for tonight's sacrifice. The feast begins soon. They will pick who will be eaten. It will not be me. Now we choose. So it begins. Stop! Coconut Sheild. Where's your father. He's inside and the drums have begun. Come. We must get Varm to attack this place with us. Amthar? He's no longer among us as a warrior. Is he? He lives, but barely and cannot fight. That makes the choices mine. My father has found a secret entrance, will it help? Yes, indeed. Come. It is too deep, it will break. How long... will I live... if it breaks? Ten minutes, one hour, not long. Long enough... pull it out. I must fight. And die? No. Let Omi heal you. There is a secret entrance. My father saw it. Has Amthar been revived? No. It is just us. Then we go alone. Before the full moon is high and the captives are sacrificed. What about my sister? She stays. If Amthar revives then he will take her home to our people. Korm will let them live. I am ready. Goodbye, My great Warrior. You will be always with me. Earth mother will always be with you Omi. I will see you again Goben. This cannot be my fate... to wait an invalid while my tribe perishes. Do not let this be my fate! Do not... This is not a secret entrance. Its that way. Goben, You are to take position at the entrance. Take all the Rock-men's eyes with your rocks. Varm and I will busy them with carnage while your people escape. As soon as we are cut down then you must run with all that can escape. You must run and hide. What do you mean cut down? I do not know that we will live. Not without Amthars strength. If I die splattered with the blood of those who killed my mother and brother, then I will die well. Now gather rocks, brave Goben. We shall meet again where Sky Father and Earth Mother live together. Let's go. That is the last one. Can you... reach it? No I am sorry. Sky father... give me strength. It didn't break! Let us save our families. There are three entrance ways. This one, the far side. And the secret passage. I go where the enemy is greatest. I will kill as many as I can before I die... and then maybe even a few more. I attack from the other side. Suta! Tak-tek. Grab them! Take woman to death pit. Suta! No! Kill the pet! No! No! No!! How find this place? Who with you? You sacrifce! Tak-tek. Gorram! Let the feast begin! You and your people will all die. Not before you! Amthar! Human! Kill Him! Now Tak-Tek, Save your wife! Tak-tek help im trapped. Tak tek! Help me! Tak-tek! Suta! Suta! Tak-Tek, tak tek, im trapped, down here! Suta! Die Human! You die first Rock-men! Amthar! Laylan! Lead the tree people out. Warriors, to your dragons! Varm! I'm here. It is a good day to die. We're not going to die. Suta! Suta! Tak-Tek! Suta I will find rope. Come on. Die! Die! Goben, omi! Mama! Amthar. Earth mother has saved you. Yes. Earth mother has saved me. And you have saved me. Omi, please help me to my chief. My great cheif, you have saved us all. You truly live... with honor... Amthar. Lead our people... lead YOUR people... well. Go to the sky father great chief, and the Earth mother where one day we all will be reunited. Monther and brother, you have been avenged. Goben I will stay with the humans, I will teach them to grow plant. That's good news. What are you making? It is a tool for making music. Ouch the point is sharp. I pounded down a medicine stone. You can come with us Goben. Tak-Tek and the Tree-People as friends to us forever! Yes! My Omi will teach you people well. Where is Goben? He should be with us here as well. Goben! Laylan! Truly among us, you are a strong warrior, Goben Treechild! Goben, stay with Omi. Mother? It is where you belong! But... Your mother and I will be fine. I spoke with them, please join us. There, it is settled. May earth mother watch over you! All hail the mighty tree people, children of the earth mother, Tak-descendants live for ten thousand years. And never be forgotten. Hail, hail, hail. This world is the Giant's now, may they use it wisely.
