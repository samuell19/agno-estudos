[CLICKING] [TYPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHEERING] [RINGING] - Hello, my love! - Hey, babe! How was the game? - It was great, we won. Nicky hit two singles and a double. Tell your mom about the game. I would've got the triple, but I tripped over second base. - That's why I tell you to keep rounding your corners, remember? - Hey, a double is really great, too, sweetie. Stan, why isn't Nicky in the back in his car seat? - Cause he's a big boy, he's not a little baby anymore. He gets to ride up in front with his old man cause he's a champion and that's what the champions do. - He's too small, okay? It's not very safe. - Daddy took the team out to lunch at the Dugout after the game! - Yes, he did. Grilled cheeses for everybody. - The Dugout, huh? Did daddy had anything to drink with his lunch? - Yes, I had one beer, Aud, thank you for asking. - And a whiskey. - You, little snitch. - Stan, you're driving. - I'm completely fine. It was an hour and a half ago, I had a full meal. Hey, we're gonna pass the stores here in a minute. You want me to grab something for dinner? A bottle of wine? What are we going to eat tonight? - Pizza! [STAN LAUGHING] - Well, what did you eat at the Dugout? - Pizza... - You want pizza again? Yep. Pizza is my favorite food. Oooh, I love this song! - Do you like Billy Joel? How do you even know Billy Joel? - He's Alexa Ray's father, right? - Who is Alexa Ray? - You know, coach, someday you gonna have to actually teach your son what this song is about. - I don't know, what is it about? - What is it about, daddy? [SCREAMING, CAR CRASHING] No, no. No. Oh, please, God, no! [STARTUP SOUND] [TYPING] [SOBBING] [WEEPING] [RINGING] (clears throat) - Audrey, huh I had to borrow one of the nurse's phones. (Sighs) Just talk to me, please. Please, come to the hospital. Please. - (Sobs) I can't. - But this wasn't my fault. I only had one drink. I was within the legal limit. I wasn't intoxicated. That truck was out of control. There was nothing I could do. - Your reflexes were slowed. You didn't put Nicky in his car seat. He might have survived. - (weeps) We don't know that. - Exactly. And we never will. I told you I told you a hundred times no to drink and drive. A hundred times! - (sobs) Please... - And now my baby is dead. - (sobs) He was my child too. (sighs) I just need you to forgive me. - (sobs) I can't I can't, it's too soon. How can you ask me that? - (weeps) I need you I need my mountain... - Don't Don't call me that. You have everything you need. The hospital has all your information. It's up to you. You'll be fine. - (stammers) No, wait, please, I need my... [CALL SUDDENLY DISCONNECTED] [SOBBING] [RINGING] I told you to leave me the fuck alone! - Audrey. - Oh, God, Father Hill, I'm so sorry. I thought you're someone else. Please, forgive me. - You thought I was Stanley? - Yeah, he's just called from the hospital. He won't give up. When I see him I just I wanna scream. - Of course. I understand. I can't even imagine how hard all of this is for you. And I'm praying for you. And for Stanley. Oh, no, I didn't mean. (sighs) Look at me, I'm calling to give you good news and I'm ruining it. - Good news? - Yes. Audrey, the church has been searching for someone like you. Someone who deserves a second chance. - Father, I don't understand. - I know this is going to seem daunting. But allow me to connect you with someone who can explain it. Audrey, this is Cardinal Degal. - Hello, my child. I have learned of your loss. I am so sorry. - (stammers) Thank you, Your... Holiness. - Your Eminence, technically, but I think Cardinal Degal will do just fine. - Okay. - I'm sure you're a bit confused, allow me to explain. I'm in charge of a special project here in the Vatican. Our mission is to help people who have been struck by great tragedy. Needless to say, when I heard your story, I thought, perhaps she could use our help. - I don't understand. Help how? - A miracle. I am here to offer you a miracle. I am Cardinal Degal. Today is the 27th of January, in the year of our Lord 2023, time is approximately 7:32 a.m. We're about to bring Subject Nineteen into the Antechamber. From everything we've learned in previous trials, I am very hopeful that... No, I am certain that we will succeed with our first attempt. May God grant us all His blessings. Let's get started. [DOORS OPENING] [WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Miss Martin, have faith. Have faith. I'm sorry. I cannot let you enter this room. You have to wait here. - But - Faith, my child. [RETREATING FOOTSTEPS] [DOORS CLOSING] (echoing) Miss Martin, there is someone who wants to see you. [MUTTERING] This is God's miracle. Your son was chosen to be the first Resurrected Person. And now he stands as an example of what awaits all people who follow the Word of God. We join you tonight with an extraordinary story out of the Vatican, where the Church has claimed to achieve the impossible. They discovered how to resurrect the recently deceased. The Pope assures the world that this is not a hoax. The Church has been pursuing this endeavor for decades. Now they say they have successfully brought a young boy killed in car crash back to life. Obviously, there is much skepticism surrounding the story. Especially, considering the Church's refusal to reveal the science behind it. Still, as of yet no one has been able to explain how the boy was revived. - So, how does this fit in with the traditional teachings of the Church? - We're not abandoning tradition. We're simply trying to move the Church into the 21st century, while still following the sacred scriptures that have been handed down to us by God. - But you're saying people have to convert if they want immortality. - We're not offering immortality. We're simply offering second chance to those who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, guys, I dunno about you but with all the Reincarnation stuff, I'm feeling a bit riskier than usual. For the record, this is not a suicide. I'm a good Christian, I love God. I'm just trying to pull off some gnarly shit. So, if I don't make it, make sure Jesus brings me back. Peace! [CRASH SOUNDS] Death is natural, it's part of the organic life cycle, even when it's tragic. But what the Catholic Church is offering is dangerous. It hasn't even been vetted by the FDA. The Surgeon General has no idea how it works. And nobody has any clue what they're actually doing, and yet their protections as a religion allows them to break the laws of nature?! - Ms. Martin, how is it that you were granted an annulment after six years of marriage? - No comment. - Mr. Martin, what do you have to say to your son's role as spokesperson for RPs. - Fuck off. - How did you get the Ecclesiastical Tribunal to agree to that? - Speak with Bishop Hill of the Archdiocese. Now, leave us in peace, please. - When have you last spoken to your son? - Fuck off! - Sir, any thoughts on RPs at all? Let the people know what it's like -to have your son brought back. -[DOOR SLAMS] As you can see, not everyone is thrilled by resurrecting family members that have died The ban on baptism has created a lucrative black market for smugglers, who offer to sneak dead loved ones out of the Middle East. Just past the border, the bodies are posthumously baptized by missionary Priests and sent off to the nearest Resurrection Center. [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - So, in order for the Church to resurrect me I have to hand over my entire digital history. We're talking phone calls, texts, emails, hard drives. This is crazy. What about privacy? Is the Church trying to become the new Big Brother? - Dude, first of all, you don t have to sign a contract. Besides, the Church can only access this information after your death. While you're alive nobody's gonna know what porn you like watching and who you've been sending your dickpics to. - All right, let's talk about these "Cherubs" for a second. Cause this is really crazy. The Church is hiring ex-hackers to look for my sins. So, some guy who only yesterday was hacking the White House or steal money from somebody's bank account is now going to rummage through my entire digital past and judge me for my sins. What the hell? (speaks indistinctly) How do you wanna believe us in this nonsense? Why do all the resurrected return without a single scratch? What about the bullet wounds, scars, and all this crap? Wake up, it's all a scam... (speaks indistinctly) - Audrey, one thing we all want to know. Is he better behaved now? Like, do you have to fight to get him to do his homework? Yeah, he's a normal kid. Just like he was before and huh But, yes, we sort of fight over homework sometimes. [GIGGLING] - Well, Nicholas, I guess being the very first resurrected person doesn't excuse you from certain responsibilities. What do you think about that? - I feel blessed. Until I have to do my homework. [APPLAUDING] [MURMURING] I'm sure all of you know Nicholas Martin's story by now. Most of you probably saw the interview when it first aired five years ago. Then we lived in a cruel world where children like Nicholas could be ripped from their parents' arms without a moment's notice. But cruelty is not God's will. for when one of his purest creations was taken away, he returned unharmed. He gave Nicholas a second chance. And that's what resurrection is. A second chance. For family, for love, for life. And understand, resurrection is not about immortality. No, it's more like a safety net for our time here on Earth. In the end, we must all return to God's Kingdom. And that's the real reward for living a good, righteous life. [CHOIR SINGING] All right, that's it for today. May the Lord be with you. May the Almighty God bless you. The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. (numerous voices) Amen! [MESSAGE BEEP SOUND] [DIAL TONE] - Hey, Dad. - (speaks excitedly) Heeey, St. Nick. What's up, buddy? - I'm good. Mom says hi. - Great. Hey, Audrey. What do you cook? - Well, it smells good anyway. - (chuckles) So, what's up? Tell me how you've been, tell me everything. How is school? - Well, it's almost Spring Break. So, I didn't really learn anything. Mom's taking me to the graffiti exhibit at the Art Center. - Well, mom's is a fun machine. - Yeah. - Look, I wanted to talk to you about Spring Break. - Well, yeah, it's gonna be awesome. Tuesday I'm doing a lecture at the Catholic Youth League. And later for the eighth grade classes of Saint Francis. Wednesday I'm doing RP at the Children's Brunch. And Thursday is I don't really remember but there is something. - Busy is good. Busy is good. - Yeah. - What do you talk about when you talk to all these people? You ever get nervous? - No, honestly they wanna know about the resurrection. How my life has changed, and stuff like that. I like it. It's fun. - You know, your old man does a lot of public speaking. I could give you some pointers. If you want. - No, don't worry. If I ever get stuck, Bishop Hill usually asks me a question or helps me out but I don't usually. - Sure. - Oh, I almost forgot. We're gonna have an Easter party here. - Christ's resurrection is a big day for us. - Yeah. - What? What is it? Something wrong? - I was thinking I can ask mom to invite you. Nicholas! - Hey, you know what, buddy. Don't bother her. If she wants to invite me, she will. Okay? And I probably, I definitely, have a mass that day. Nicholas! - Okay, I gotta go. I love you, dad. - I love you too. Hey, can you put your mom on for a second? - Yeah, just one sec. Hey, mom. Dad wants to talk. - Heeeey. - Hi! - What's up? How are you? - Everything's good. We are fine. - Great. Hey, Audrey, listen. He missed our call last week. You know, it's really important to me that I get this time with him. It's really the only chance we have to talk and I need these calls. - Yeah, sorry, I know. He's just so busy right now. - Yeah, he tells me he is talking to all sort of groups. But is he getting enough down time, does he get enough time to be himself? Is he even playing sports anymore? - You know, it's his choice. I've asked him. He's having fun, he's meeting a lot of new people, learning a lot. He's fine, Stan, really. - Cool. Cool. Oh, he told me that you guys are having an Easter party. Is that right? - Ah, yeah, I thought he could use a little celebration. - Definitely. It's a good idea. Great idea. Who is coming? - Umm, Nicky's friends from school, some of the neighbors. He's been talking to so many large groups lately. I wanna keep this one small. - Yeah. - Yeaaah. [MESSAGE BEEPING] - Okay. I won't keep you. Take care, Aud. - You too, Stan. Bye. Little Mountain... (sighs) [TYPING] They told me it was going to feel strange coming back, that I will have to readjust to being alive. But I didn't think it was going to be this hard. - I believed in Islam. And one day I die and wake up and my wife tells me I've been baptized - Do you resent her for that? - No, she went to a great risk to smuggle my body out of Syria just to bring me back. - You know, she did it because she loves you. - This is a waste of time, Father. - Well, it's mandatory Frank. Every RP has two months of counseling. I'm sorry but it's to help you to integrate back in the life. - When you finally reach the end and see what's beyond. (sighs excitedly) It's an incredible rush. Have you ever died, Father? I think I've asked you that already. - I have not. - It's amazing. - You know, after the car crash they didn't bring her back. Just me. When I ask them why, they show me these text messages that a cherub has found. I mean, okay, I know that she was cheating on me with some guy but it's not a murder. It's not a war crime. - Well, as I understand it - I don't care what she did. If I can forgive her, Father, why can't God? (sobs) Why can't the Church, huh? - Well, I still can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes I'd see him coming at me with that knife. I feel it slicing into me. Ice cold, yet it burned... - We were struggling before I died. We are struggling worse now. My company downsized while my family was waiting for me to be brought back. Now I can't get a job. Everywhere I go companies don't wanna hire RPs. I'm ready to sell our home, take my family and move to another country. Show them a better way. - Before you do that you might be interested to know that I reached out the foreman of your old construction site. I had a little word with him. And well, I think you're ready to start on Monday. - Really? - Damn right! (laughs) - So, I let a stupid cancer take me instead and it took forever and it really hurt. And now that I'm back everybody's at school looking at me like I'm some kind of freak. I wish I killed myself when I have a chance. And my parents wouldn't be able to bring me back at all. - Look, I don't like when you talk about hurting yourself. You're a righteous person. You were challenged. You stayed strong. It's amazing, Rose. Rose, you are amazing! Okay? (chuckles) [REMINDER SOUND] - All right. That's our time. You good? You gonna be okay? - I'm amazing. - Talk soon.

I'm glad you called. I was getting so bored sitting here alone. Anything I can do to help you? Where is the camera? I can't see you. Ooh, you must be a celebrity. Or a politician. I see you've taken out Demerit Sweeper Insurance. Good. What would you like me to do? That's brilliant. Because ever since we connected I wanted to tell you all the nasty things Well, just talk. Anything in particular? My day? It's been an average day like many other. An average day The truth or the fantasy? I took my son to school at 9 and went shopping for food, picked up some shirts at the cleaner's. My husband picked up our son from school at 3. Then I made dinner and Of course. We don't keep secrets from each other. Well... I don't wanna be resurrected. I am a One-Lifer. When my time is up, it's up. Let nature take its course, is how I look at it. Well, now it's your turn. Tell me about your day. [NOTIFICATION SOUND] [NOTIFICATION SOUND] [NOTIFICATION SOUND] [NOTIFICATION SOUND] [NOTIFICATION SOUND] [NOTIFICATION SOUND] [RINGING] - Good morning, Bishop. - Good morning. Haven't you seen the news? No, sorry, I just woke up. I was having a late morning. - Stan, there's been an incident. - What kind of incident? In Pittsburgh, they're constructing some skyscraper and one of the construction workers just started pushing his coworkers off the edge. Seventeen people fell to their death. - Oh my God, it's horrible. It gets worse The man who did it was an RP. This isn't just some RP, this man was someone from your flock. You were his counselor, Stan. - Oh my God! Frank Collins? That doesn't make any sense. I just saw Frank. Where is he now? - The cops had to shoot him with a bean bag gun and he fell. - What do you mean he fell? - 12 stories. He's dead. - There was no sign he was suicidal. None! Nothing! He was happy. I just helped him to get his job back. He was happy! - This doesn't look good for the Church, Stan. We are strategizing what to do and we are going to need your help. - Anything. What's the protocol for something like that? - There's no protocol for something like this! It's never happened before. Now, I'm setting you up with a video chat with an agent Ortiz. She is in charge with Resurrected Persons Unit of the FBI and I really need you to cooperate with her. - Of course, your Excellency. - That means to give her whatever information she wants. And I mean it, Stan. Whatever she wants. - Yes, Bishop. - Now, in the meantime, I think it might be best for you to take a break. - But what about my congregation? - Oh no, we'll provide a substitute Priest, of course. Your flock will be in good hands. And it's only temporary, of course. - Am I being suspended right now? - Oh, Stan, calm down. I'm doing what I think is best just until the spotlight is off of you and the dust settles. And Stan, there's another thing. It's best if you avoid contact with Nicholas for the time being. - Well now wait a minute, what does he have to do with this? - Nothing. And we need to keep it that way. You don't want the press asking him a lot of questions, do you? We must protect him from that. - I would never, ever involve him. - No, you wouldn't, but others would. I'm only asking for silence. Once this thing calms down you can contact Nicholas whenever you want. I'm sorry, Stan. I'm so sorry about this. - Let's pray for the victims. - Yes, the victims, indeed. [CALL ENDS] - But by Resurrecting the victims, aren't you effectively saying "it's okay to kill people, because there aren't any consequences"? - Forgive me for saying so but that's ridiculous. Of course, there are consequences. The Fifth Commandant: thou shalt not kill. It is a mortal sin for anyone to take the life of a human being, anyone who commits such sin is no longer eligible for Resurrection. There is a consequence. Look, I just don't see why the actions of one troubled man should ruin the lives of the Resurrected? - But what do you say to the One-Lifers, who insist that it isn't natural to be tampering with mortality? They say bringing humans back to life is devaluing being alive. - The One-Lifers are fanatics and atheists. They have no beliefs, no faith. They think we're no different than insects. [RINGING] - Hello, Agent Ortiz? - Yes, Father Martin. Bishop Hill told you I'd be calling. - He did, yes. I'm at Resurrected Persons Unit of the bureau. You were the perpetrator's mental health counselor. Is that correct? - Yes, and his Priest. - Were you surprised when you heard what he had done? - I was shocked. (stutters) I'm in shock, I still am. It doesn't make any sense. He was... He was happy. I just helped him to get his job back - So, no reported depression? - None. If anything, he was happier than he's ever been. I mean he... - I need you to send me the recordings of your sessions with Frank Collins. Can you email those to me? - Well, that would be a violation of the sanctity of the seal. The Church doesn't record sessions. - Actually, they do. And Bishop Hill assured me that you would cooperate. - Even if that was true... - It's true. You and I both know it. - To do so would be instant grounds for excommunication. I could lose my priesthood. - The Penitent is no longer alive, and he is not coming back. I could get a court order, but I'd really hate to do that because it would cost me a day. But just so you know, if I get that court order, we come in like gangbusters. And we are liable to do some damage. I'll have to confiscate all of your devices. That means your cellphone too. So, no Internet, no phone access until my investigation is complete. Cut off. Is that understood? - That won't be necessary. I can email those files over to you now. - Thank you, Father. Have a great day. [CALL ENDS] - Yeah. You too, asshole. [SIGHS] My brothers and sisters, it's good to see you all here connected today. Unfortunately, due to some personal affairs that require my attention, I will be unable to lead tonight's mass. So, I'll be taking a short leave of absence. But don't worry. I'm leaving you in the capable hands of Father Dorian. - Does this have anything to do with what happened in Pittsburgh, Father? - Is the church responsible? - I can assure you that the authorities and the Church are investigating. Right now I don't know any more than you do. - Is that why you're leaving? - No. - Were you fired? - As I said, I have some personal affairs to attend to. - Did that guy kill all those people - because he was resurrected? - My wife is being resurrected next week, is she gonna try to kill me and the kids? - How did the Church managed to resurrect the murderer? - What do you hide? [MURMURING] [SAD MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS] [LIQUID POURING] [MESSAGE ARRIVES] [MESSAGE ARRIVES] [MESSAGE ARRIVES] Although the police have not confirmed the identity of the perpetrator, we've learned that his name was Frank Collins, an RP working sporadically in the construction industry. We've also learned that the FBI's RP Unit has taken charge of this case, led by Agent Gloria Ortiz. At the same time, the Church has released a statement that... What the hell? [CALLING] [LOUD MUSIC PLAYING] - Hello! - Hi, are you Cherub 45274? - What? - Hi, are you Cherub - Wait, hold on! - Sorry about that, Father. What can I do for you? - Are you Cherub 45274? - That's me. - (chuckles) They put you in charge of judging people's souls? - Crazy, right? Are you putting me back to work now? - No, I'm-- What do you mean "back to work"? Were you suspended? - It's not my fault the guy went nuts. I'll tell you like I told the other guy, I just sign the recommendations. I don't do the paper work. Is that what you're calling about, right? - Well, it is, sort of. I was his priest. - Okay. Why are you calling me? - Well, I was suspended too. I read this news story about an RP who went on a killing spree. Just like my Parishioner in Pittsburgh, the one that you've approved. And they blamed the priest and the cherub for it. They blamed them for everything. - So what? You think this gonna happen to us? - The priest's name was Father Robert Flynn, but when I tried to look him up, it's like he'd been completely wiped from the Internet. It s like he doesn't exist. - And that's relevant to me? How? - It's really strange, don't you think? It's like someone erased him. - You sound kind of paranoid, Father? Okay. I was wondering if in your training the Church ever asked you to do anything beyond the realm of resurrection recommendations? Like to perform other duties with your technical talents? - Like what? - Like I said, Father Flynn has been wiped from the Internet. And I was hoping to find out how it's possible. And I thought that you could help me. - Why would you think that? - Cause you're a cherub. And I'm a priest. And we both seek to bring light to the darkness. - That sounds noble and all but are you even supposed to be talking to me? - I don't know. Why not? - So you wouldn't mind if I run this past my boss first. - Look, other cherub is listed as being on permanent hiatus. So, if this shakes out the same way, you won't have to worry about having a boss anymore. - Fine. Send me whatever you have on this Father Flynn guy. I'll look into it. - Yeah, thank you. My name is Father Martin by the way. - Call me Rat. - Rat Like the bubonic plague? - What? No, RAT like Remote Access Trojan. - Oh, I guess it's a hacker thing or something [CALL ENDS ABRUPTLY] Oh, Jesus. (sighs) [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - Stan! I'm on my way to Rome, can I call you back? - This has happened before. - What? - Frank Collins. He's not the first RP to go on a killing spree. The dentist who started murdering her patients, the old man who killed his grandkids. The guy who drowned his family at the beach. - I don't understand, Stan. - Your Excellency, the matter is Frank Collins is not the first RP to go on a killing spree. You told me that there is no protocol for something like this. There have to be. - You're taking things out of context. - There's undeniable pattern of behavior here - No one's denying anything. Yes, we've had a few RPs who've gone astray, but they're human beings, Stan. That dentist she had some mental illness and she stopped taking her medications prescribed before her Resurrection. The grandfather had dementia and the man at the beach, well, he just snapped when he discovered that his wife had an affair with another man while he was dead. These people are flawed and cracked. Sometimes they bend, sometimes they break. Just like you and me. - No. You didn't tell me any of that before. - I didn't see any connection before. - Am I under internal investigation? - No, of course not. After the FBI discovers the evidence... - Okay, so, where are the rest of the priests? Are any of them still working for the church? - You're getting ahead of yourself here. - Then why won't you just tell me what happened to the other RP Counselors? Are they being mothballed, am I next? - Now, hold on. - No, Bishop, listen to me. Please, just tell me what's going on. If there is something sinful happening here, and we don't address it now, it's only going to get worse. - That's enough. You certainly crossed a line here. Just because there are certain things I'm not at liberty to share with you, doesn't mean that there is any kind of a cover up or a conspiracy. Stan, you're beginning to slip back into your old way of life. It's not good for you, it's not good for the Church, and certainly not good for your family. Get some exercise, get some sleep or something. You look terrible. And we'll talk later. [CALL ENDS] (chokes) [CALL STARTS] - Hi. Hello, Father Flynn, this is - Sorry, I can't make it to my screen at the moment. I'm indisposed. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. God bless. [CALL ENDS] Hi, Father Flynn, my name is Stanley Martin, Father Stanley Martin. I'm calling because it's in regards to your parishioner (stutters) Anyway, I think we have some commonalities that I'd like to discuss. Can you give me a call back? I would really, really appreciate it. Okay. Thanks. (speaks Italian) Please, leave a message and I will get back to you as soon as possible. (speaks Japanese) (speaks Russian) Hi, this is Father Stanley Martin. Stanley Martin calling. I'm the Father of the man in Pittsburgh. I'm calling for Father James... for Father Antony Russo. I was hoping to speak to you. There are some commonalities that I would like to discuss. And I was hoping to have a brief conversation with you. If you can give me a call back in the earliest convenience I would really appreciate. Thank you. Thank you. God bless. [RINGING] [RINGING CONTINUES] - Father Flynn! Hi! I'm so glad that you give me a call back. - Are you one of them? Do you know what they're planning? - I'm not sure what you're talking about. Did you get my message last night? - Your message the RP? - Yeah. That's exactly why I called you. He was the parishioner in Pittsburgh who pushed those poor people off the building. I think there might be some similarities to what happened to - No, no, you don't know anything The frequencies have mutated, don't you understand? The Huguenots tried to warn us. - I'm sorry Father Flynn, I don't know what you're talking about. - No one will listen to me! We are running out of time. You can't stop them. - Stop who? - The Warriors, you fool. They're multiplying. Soon they'll be everywhere. They're coming to silence me. - Father, who is trying to silence you? Is the Church trying to cover something up? Because if you have any details at all - They are here. They are inside me now. - Father. What are you doing with that? - Father, put down the gun. What are you doing with that? Father, please stop! Don't! Don't do that! Please, put it down! Father Flynn, please, put down the gun! - Thoughts and prayers. [GUN SHOOTING] [LINE RINGING] - 911, what's your emergency? - (stutters) I, I want to report a... there's a... - I didn't get that. What's your address? Fuck... [CALLING] [MOANING] - RAT! RAT! Your camera is on! - Father? What the fuck I was trying to turn the app off - You turned it on instead. But good, because I really need to talk to you. - You have great timing, Father, I'll give you that. We're not living in sin, we're engaged. - Rat, stop! - At least we're engaged to be engaged - Please, stop, I need to talk to you. Shut up, please! I have to show you something. Brace yourself. - Hey, are you okay, dude? You look white as a sheet. - Jesus fucking shit! Who the fuck is that? - That's Father Robert Flynn. I called him last night and I left him a message. And he called me back a few minutes ago. - Jesus, what the fuck did you get me into, Father? - He was trying to tell me something, right. But he was rambling, it wasn't making any sense. Something about a plan, said someone was after him. He was terrified. - This is some crazy shit, Father. Did you call the cops? - Not exactly - What does this mean? - Look, I need your help figuring out what is going on. - No! No, dude, you need to call the cops. Now! If I call the cops now we'll never get access to what he knew, and the police will want to know why was I talking to him at the first place. How did I get his number. Do you see where I'm going with that? - This is fucked up shit, Father. Excuse my Latin. - Look, all of our computers are connected right now, right? Can't you just go in there and copy his hard drive or something? He was scared enough to kill himself, he had to know something. We have to figure out what it was. - No. We definitely don't. - Look, I know you don't wanna be involved in this, but you are, okay? And I can't do this alone. Please. I'm gonna share my screen with you. - Fine. Whatever. - Oh, is this gonna leave a trace? Don't worry, I'm gonna delete any trace of this being here. All right. Count to three. - Why? - Just do it. - One, two, three - Whoa - You know, this is really messed up. Right, I'm in his hard drive and I'm erasing you from his call log. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. Literally. Done. - Okay, let's go through the drive. - No, Father, definitely not. I'm gonna go through his drive myself and I'll let you know if I find anything. - What? No, that's not what. I'm not arguing with you. I work better without someone looking over my shoulder. There is something and I will find it. But what you'll be looking for? - Trust me. I'm a cherub. It's my job to find things people don't want to be found. - Fine. How long is it gonna take? - Take a pill. I'll let you know. [CALL ENDS] (sighs) [GULPING] (takes breath) (sighs) [TYPING] [CLICKING] [RINGING] [HITTING THE FLOOR] [BOTTLES RATTLING] [RINGING CONTINUES] (sniffles) - Hey - Jesus, were you in a fight? No, I haven't been sleeping very well. What'd you find? - I didn't find anything. - What? That's impossible. Did you check everything? Emails? Did you check everywhere on the computer? Hidden directories? Chats? - I checked everything, Father. I went through his drive. Twice. It's clean. There is not a single suspicious file or folder on it... - Do it again, check the cloud or something, I don't know. - I checked everything. I even hacked into Bishop Hill's drive. There is nothing there. There are no conspiracies, no cover-ups. These are the most boring drives I've ever hacked. This whole thing, dude, is a dead end. Are you okay? You look kinda hungover. - I'm not. - You can't lie to a cherub, Father. - Father Flynn, he wouldn't just kill himself like that, right? He specifically called me. It was He was trying to tell me something. He was making a statement. - Maybe he felt guilty about what happened to his Parishioner. I don't know... Sometimes people snap for no reason. It's a good thing that we didn't find anything, right? Because that means there is nothing to worry about. (sighs) - Look, Father. I did some reading on you. You forgot to mention that your son is Nicholas Martin. - What's your point? - My point is, I get why you're so sensitive about this RP stuff. I can't even imagine what you've been through. But dude, getting wasted isn't helping. - You don't know what you're talking about, right? I don't know if you're doing this to punish yourself because of what happened to your son, or if you're one of those regular old drunks, but you need to put the bottle down. It's messing with your head. - I didn't imagine any of this! - I know. You didn't. Shit happens. - Dude, the world is a crazy place but that's why people need the Church. To help make sense out of all of it. You have an eccentric priest who commits suicide. You have someone that you're counseling and they do something terrible. That's just life on Earth. It's messy. (sighs) (groans) - You know, I still think we should've called the cops. But I guess it's too late for that now. And I'm serious about the booze. - Thank you. - I'm supposed to report on stuff like this. But I'm gonna let it side because of what you've been through. But you've got a problem, I know the signs. You don't want to dig yourself into a hole you can't get out of. - Yeah, well, you and I both know a priest has to do something really bad not to get resurrected. - Maybe it's this life you should be worried about. Look, I gotta go. But I am here if you need to talk to somebody, okay? - Yeah. (clears throat) And, Rat, just...thank you. - Don't mention it. I guess you can't this time. Whatever. Bye. [CALL ENDS] [MESSAGE ARRIVES] Hi, Stan, um Listen, I've been thinking over and well, I figured maybe you wanna come here on Easter Sunday. Maybe you could give the Blessing. I know Nicky would be really thrilled to see you, so um Yeah, I just wanna let you know that you are more than welcome to join if you want. It's at 10 a.m. And also I wanted to apologize for the other day. I know, all of this cannot be easy for you. So, I didn't mean for this message to be so long. Let me know if you can make it. Bye. [VIDEO MESSAGE ENDS] (takes breath) (sniffles) [TYPING] [LIQUID POURING] [OBJECTS CLINKING] - Stan. - Your Excellency, good morning. Do you have some time for me? - How are we feeling this morning? - To be honest, I'm feeling a little bit embarrassed about my behavior the other night. You were absolutely correct and I hope you'll forgive me. I'm very happy to hear that, Stan. And of course I forgive you. You're a very important member of this Diocese. And I understand, everybody is under a great deal of stress, especially with the incident in Pittsburgh. But actually, Stan, I have some good news for you. - Huh? - I just heard back from the FBI. They finished their investigation and you're cleared to return to work. - Really? (grins) - Stan, everybody knew you had nothing to do with this. - What was the determination? - It sounds like Mr. Collins had a rather violent criminal history and this was pre-Resurrection and somehow he managed to hide that from the Cherubim. - But I thought the Cherubim never missed anything? - Don't be naive, Stan. There are plenty of ways to hide sinful behavior. I mean those encrypted servers, there is retro-tech and that's just for the sins people commit online. There is no true way to judge a soul. All we can hope is to convince them enough to behave. - So... What's gonna happen to the Cherub that approved Frank for Resurrection? - I'm afraid I can't talk about that. - I'm sure that they did their best. Hope they won't be disciplined. - Stan, please, just relax. This is good news. It's all good. And if you're up to it, you can come back to work as soon as you want. - That that would be great. And um, Nicky? - Nicholas? Call him whenever you like. (breathes out) - Thank you. Thank you, Bishop. I am indebted to you. - You're welcome, Stan. Now, get out there and harvest more souls. - All right. [CALL ENDS] - Gotta tell you, Rose, sounds like things are going really well these days? - Yeah. At first I was worried he was only into me because I'm the only other RP in school, but we actually have like a lot in common. Plus he's popular and now all his friends are my friends. (grins) You're too much! - What about you, Father? Sometimes I just feel weird talking about myself so much. - That's okay, that's why I'm here. To listen. - I know, but I don't know anything about you. Do you priests have the same kinds of problems as normal people? - Oh yeah! Priests are just normal people. Most of us. Actually, I always have felt that God takes those truly broken souls and makes them his priests. We have the most to learn. - That's sort of beautiful. In a sad way. - You know, years ago I hurt someone. In the most painful way imaginable. And they couldn't forgive me. I couldn't forgive myself even after I became a priest, which is not how it is supposed to work. (grins) But um...recently that person invited me back in her life and it's a step in the right direction. Is it TMI? - No, thank you for sharing that with me. I think, in a way, Judgment day is every day. Don't you think? - Yeah, well, the penitent comforting the confessor. (laughs) - I like that. Maybe I could be a priest. (grins) [NOTIFICATION SOUND] - Okay, Rose, that's our time. - Thank you, Father. - It was great to see you. - You too. [CALL ENDS] [CALLING] - Hey, Chris! [HARSH SOUND] - Hello, Father! - Oh, God. Chris, what have you done? - Don't worry, Father. We have a cleaning lady every Tuesday. - Chris, listen to me! Are any of them alive? If they need medical attention, I might help - Alive? None of them were ever truly alive, Father. But we're changing that. Soon everyone will wake up and learn what life is really about. - Why? Why? - You don't understand, Father. Once they see what we've seen, they'll be grateful. They'll thank us. You'll all thank us. - Listen to me. Chris, I'm calling the police, right? You need to put the knife down. - Sorry, Father. I can't do that. I'm just getting started. [CALL ENDS] No, no, not again! - 911, what's your emergency? - Hi, my name is Father Stanley Martin. A man just attacked his family. I don't know if they're alive or they're dead. I think he's planning on hurting more people, okay? His name is Chris Silva. You need to... get an ambulance! - Do you have an address? - Okay, 30 Sherwood Avenue, White Plains, New York. - I don't place your call anywhere near that location, Sir. - No, I was over a video chat with him. I'm his counselor. I could see it all on the background. There was blood everywhere, there were You need to send them an ambulance right now! - All right, Sir. Don't worry, I'm dispatching units right now. Can I get an exact (breathes shakily) [CALLING] - Father Martin. - Another one of my parishioners just went on a killing spree. - What? - Okay, I already called it in to the police. I call you for a different reason, right? I think this parishioner and my parishioner in Pittsburgh, I think that they're connected. I think that Church might be hiding something I don't Look, Bishop Hill was... - Listen, I didn't trust him from the beginning. - You didn't? - No. Listen, he hasn't been truthful with me and I just knew something wasn't right. There is something shady going on. - Thank God, I was afraid no one's gonna believe me. - Listen to me. Where are you now? Are you some place safe? - Yeah, I'm home. - Okay, good. Stay where you are and don't call anyone. I'll make a quick phone call and I'll be right back. Until I do do not talk to anyone. [CALL ENDS] [MUMBLES] Shit! [CALLING] Hey, this is Rat. Leave a message and if I like what you have to say I'll call you back. Or not. Rat, it's me. Something happened. You gotta call me. It's urgent. All right. Just I'll be there waiting for your call, right? [CALL ENDS] [TAPPING] [GULPING] [CALLING] - Hey, Dad. - Hey, Nicky. Is you mom here? Gotta talk to her. - She is busy. - Well, tell her it's really important. - Yeah. Mom, Dad wants to talk to you. Says it's very important. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] Sorry, but... - She's escorting Bishop Hill out of the house, so she can't talk right now. - Oh yeah? How often is Bishop Hill at the house? - Um, he's been here a few times. Why? - You know, you can tell me anything, right? I mean anything. - Yeah, of course. - Tell your mom to call me as soon as she can, right? - Yeah, sure. But you're coming to the Easter party tomorrow, right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna miss it for the world. - I love you, Dad. - I love you too, son. - Bye. [CALL ENDS] [RINGING] - Hey, Father. (shouts) Watch out! Hey! Hey, stop it! Leave him alone! I'm calling the cops! [FIGHTING] - Hello, hi, no, I need someone right now! 99 Beam Street 6th floor. She is trying to kill him. Fuck! Stop! Get the fuck out of there! I'm recording. You will not get away with this. [CRASHING SOUNDS] Fuck off! I'm serious! [BREAKING SOUNDS] Leave him alone! [CHOKING] Oh, fuck! Oh my God! Come on, come on! Oh my God, oh my God! I killed her. Why were you doing that? - Rat? That's special agent Ortiz, head of the RP Unit. - Dude! You just killed an FBI agent? - She didn't give me a choice, did she? Right before that I called Ortiz and told her everything. Two minutes later she is in my apartment trying to kill me. - She was already there. - She's been outside watching me. To see how much I know. - So, this is a conspiracy between the Church and the FBI? [POLICE SIRENS] - Shit! So, I sort of maybe called the cops when it looked like you were being murdered. You may not want to be there when they show up. - (sobs) It was self-defense! - I don't think that matters. [POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING] - Yeah. Yeah, point taken. I will call you. As soon as I get the chance. - Okay. Leave. [WINDOW OPENING] [POLICE BREAKING IN] Search the rooms. Law enforcement officers have put out an all-points bulletin for Father Stanley Martin. Martin is wanted for questioning in the murder of an FBI agent who was found dead in his home earlier today. [CALLING] - Oh Father, thank God. I thought the cops got you. Where are you right now? - I'm in an Internet café. - Do they still exist? - Apparently. I'm using one of the computers, I thought that the feds might be tracking my phone. - That is smart move. You're everywhere on the news, the cops put out a dragnet for you. Look, check it out. I did some digging on that FBI agent and it turns out she was killed on the job and resurrected three years ago. - Yeah, makes sense that the Bureau would put an RP in charge of the RP Unit. - Yeah, except that when your first parishioner went nuts, she said he had history of violence, which I know isn't true because I'm the one who recommended him for Resurrection. I don't make those kinds of mistakes. - So, she's not investigating RP crimes, she's covering them up. That's why she wanted the recordings of my sessions with Frank. To see if he told me anything I wasn't supposed to know. - Like what? - Iguess that's what we have to figure out. - Okay well then, check this out. - I hacked into the FBI server and I got Agent Ortiz's drive. I figured if anyone had evidence about what's going on it's gotta be her. - You hacked the FBI? - Chill, Father. It's not that big a deal, their cyber security isn't even as good as the Church's. Here, take a look. If you click "Case files" and then go over to "Closed cases", you're gonna see all the info that Agent Ortiz had on your RPs. And all of Father Flynn's, plus every RP she's ever investigated ever. - So if we figure out what these RPs had in common, maybe we'll figure out what's going on. What are you doing? I'm writing a script that will cross-reference multiple documents and look for identical character sequences. - Yeah, of course, you are. - Jackpot! - What? What you got? - It's in the web histories. The both RPs frequented the same URL. A lot. - Okay, what's the website? It's a dark web chat forum. Um Warriors-Of- Enlightenment-dot-RP. - That's what Father Flynn was ranting about. The Warriors. That's who he said had to be stopped. - Okay. I'm gonna share my screen with you. Because you cannot log into the dark web from an internet café. Okay. You see it? - It's password protected? - Yeah, and not for long. [ERROR SOUND] - What's wrong? - Damn. These servers are more secure than the FBI's. Oh, thank you. - Father, are you drinking alcohol right now? - If Ortiz was protecting people using this website maybe she was a user too. Can you see if she's got her password saved somewhere on her drive? - Hey, Father, I'll make a hacker out of you, yet. - Got it! (chuckles) [SCROLLING] We have waited a long time. We have shown great discipline. We must resist the temptation to begin our work prematurely We found another LARPer on the site, another Judas taken down. Remember, the Church is a House of False Prophets, and that House will crumble. But if we are exposed we will have failed in our crusade. - What is this? - Well, if I know anything about cults, it sounds like one of those. Am I the only one worried we're just going to get arrested after Resurrection Day? - Wait, scroll to the top comment. That's exactly what Chris Silva said. That they'll be grateful. - Shit Check this one out. Hey fellow Warriors, I don't have any family to save on Resurrection Day, so I think I'll go out and save as many souls as I can. Does anyone have advice on how I can maximize the number of kills, before someone stops me? - This is it, Rat! They're talking about mass murder. - Shit! It looks like Agent Ortiz has administrative privileges too. Or had, I guess. I guess. Well, I think this comment is about you. - They've been planning this for years - Shit! They're hacking data encryption programs and tracking people's activity. They're planning to release everything anyone's ever done on the dark web. That's Matthew 3:10 They don't want any sinners coming back. They weaponized resurrection. Matthew 3.11. It's baptism by fire. - It's a mass murder flash mob. - Hey, up in the right corner, you see? That little clock symbol. Can you click on that? - Yeah. - 4 hours until ceremony? What ceremony? - It's Easter. It's Christ's Resurrection. Nicky He's got a party at 10 a.m. I've got to know if he's involved, Can you run a global search on the website? Tell me if my son's name is mentioned anywhere. Hey, his name is Nicholas. - I know who he is. Nothing. He's not listed anywhere. - Okay, I need to tell Audrey to cancel the party anyway. So they do know. - Wait, shit! Okay, okay! That gives me an idea [MUMBLES] - Wait. Wait, hold on. Do you think that's a good idea? Shit! - Wait! What if they already know that's not true? - What if it is true? You got a better idea? [MESSAGE SOUND] Fuck it! - Write something! - Okay! Okay! [MUMBLES] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [NOISE DISTURBANCE] Make them stop! Got you! I'm sorry, Father. These guys are gonna be on your ass in a few minutes. Oh yeah! - Okay, what about you? - My IP is encrypted. I'm gonna see if I can get back into the forum. If I can, I can try to get evidence of what they're doing and I can make an anonymous drop to the media. - Maybe they can warn the public - No, no, no! Holy fucking shit! 911, what's your emergency? Hello, police. I want to report that I saw the suspect Stanley Martin at the Bolt Internet Café. 441 Franklin Avenue. Thanks for your report, please name... [DOOR OPENING] That's him! Stop the car! Dispatching Unit Nineteen. [POLICE SIRENS] [CAR RUSHING] Stop or I'll shoot! [GUN SHOTS] Where did he go? Let's see if we can cut him off at the other end. [TYPING] [CALLING] [DOG BARKING] - Father, thank God! I've been waiting for your call all night. - I had to steal a phone. I broke the seventh commandment - I'll let it slide. Are you okay? - No! Now we have fifteen minutes. Did you send everything to the media? - I found a way back into the forum. I'm downloading all the proof that we need. But what about your son? Is he okay? - I don't know yet. I just got here. There are two cops around the house. I guess they're expecting me. Anything you can do? - Can you zoom in on that number? - Yeah. Unit Nineteen. Unit Nineteen. Suspect has been spotted four blocks from your location. Please, respond. Copy dispatch. We're on it. [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SCREECHING] - You're brilliant! I owe you one. - You owe me so much more than one. Good luck. - Okay. as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the glory of God. Forever and ever. Amen. Amen! Now, as we recite the Rite of Peace, we'll prepare for the Eucharist. This is the body and the blood of Christ. [DOOR OPENING] Through Him, with Him, in the Unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor - Hey, I need to talk to you. - Dad! You missed the - Shush, listen! The Warriors of Enlightenment, have you ever heard of them? - Dad, take the Eucharist and then we will be all caught up, okay? - Did Bishop ever tell you about the Warriors of Enlightenment? You need to tell me. - It is about wonderment, not warriors, come on! - Please, tell me. I need you to focus. Stan! What are you doing here? The police are You stay away from my family! Father Martin! The police are out front waiting for you. How did you get in? - Audrey, please. No, no, no! Stop! - You smell like beer. Have you... have you been drinking? - This isn't about drinking. It wasn't about drinking then, and it's not about drinking now! You didn't give me a chance. You didn't listen to me - I have tried! - Please! You're in danger! - We are in danger from you! We are in this position because of you! Goddamn it! Look at yourself! Look at how you're scaring your son! I want you out of my house, Stan. Go. - Mom, Dad, stop fighting, please! (shouts) I want you out of my house, now! - You don't understand, right? I just need to make sure that - That we're safe? Yes, we are safe! Get out! [PHONE RINGING] I just sent out all the data. Hopefully, they'll start warning the public within an hour. Did you make it? - Um Yeah, they're fine. [BANGING] - What was that? - Listen to me. Sounds like gunfire. Let me check it out. - Please, be careful. - Yeah. (breathes shakily) [GUNFIRE] Run, run! Don't move. Honey, please! [FIGHTING] Goddamn it, Father Martin! [EXPLOSION] [GUNFIRE] [ENGINE ROARING] [HELICOPTER NOISE] [MACHINE-GUN SHOOTING] [CARS CRASHING] (screams in horror) - Father, father, administer last Rites, please! - No, you're not going to die! - Please, Father! - Stop! (breathing heavily) God bless you, girl. [GUN SHOTS] (sobs) [PHONE RINGING] - Nicky? - Hey, Dad. - No! Oh my God! Don't move, I'm coming! I'm coming for you! - It's all right! They will be back. At least the righteous, and they'll be grateful. Nicky, you did this? You're one of them Hold on, the Eucharist - The body of Christ, Dad. What better way to go. And the righteous will be reborn like Jesus was. - Why did you do this? (pants) Hey, it's okay, Mom. The pain will be over soon. - Audrey - It's okay We'll bring her back, be a family again. - It's my fault. - And I forgive you. (groans) - That's what Resurrection is about. Second chances. Now, hurry up. I'll meet you at the RP Center. Dad? Though the casualties are still being counted, the estimated body count is expected to reach upwards of a half million people In a statement condemning the actions of the cult, who call themselves the Warriors of Enlightenment, the Vatican announced it will be opening seven new Resurrection Centers to help expedite what will be a long and logistically challenging process... Though it is unclear how many of those killed will qualify for Resurrection after the data caches of several dark web encryption programs were made public, ousting countless clergy and civilians alike, and prompting worldwide calls for more relaxed standards and transparency in resurrection protocols... One of the main organizers of the Warriors of Enlightenment was none other than Father Stanley Martin, wanted in connection for the murder of an FBI agent just hours before he poisoned a house full of worshippers, killing all involved including his ex-wife. His son Nicholas Martin, the very first Resurrected Person, was uninjured in the attack. Nicholas Martin has been sequestered in a location inside the Vatican out of harm's way. All requests for interviews have been denied at this time. While Father Martin's crimes disqualified him from being resurrected himself, more and more people are protesting against being resurrected in general. We're all sinners, every last one of us. So why are we allowing the Church to take control of our lives? The Church will do well to remember that sins are meant to be forgiven, not punished. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. I don't see any stones here. The tragedy that befell us on Easter had nothing to do with these people being Resurrected. Not every RP was a part of this. This was simply a group of misguided impressionable souls who fell prey to the words of false prophets. There is no reason that these victims were disqualified and were not given the second chance. to live long and healthy lives. - Cardinal, Is the Church willing to accept responsibility for what resurrected people do with those second chances you're giving them? - The Church has taken responsibility for sinners for thousands of years. And we are not about stop now. Admittedly, mistakes were made, perhaps some hubris, but these mistakes are all part of man's imperfection, isn't that so? We learn from out mistakes and we strive to do better. That is God's will. But to deny the miracle of Resurrection simply because some people did some bad things... No, this is not God's will. - But even now the Church refuses to divulge the true nature of what you call a miracle. How can the public trust something when they have no concept of how it even works or what it is? - Well, that's the point of a miracle, isn't it? You've got to have faith.
