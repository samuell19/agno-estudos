[panting] I know now what it's like to look into the face of a man who has professed to love you fully, unconditionally, and forever, and then watch his lips form the words "I'm going to kill you". Hey, is um, something on your mind? I'm just wondering if we'll ever spend a weekend not in a hotel room. I'll take you to breakfast. We'll talk for hours. Anything you want. I have a flight in an hour. Have a friend cover for you. You have a flight in an hour and a half. It's France, Grace. Passengers will understand. Listen, I'll be back in the States in a couple weeks. Maybe we'll see each other. Maybe. I'll check my flight schedule. Get dressed. ♪ Have a good night, Grace! I will! Thank you so much for taking care of my little guy. No problem. Hi. I missed you. Hey, buddy. Hi. Hi. [beep] [Voicemail] Hey, hey, hey, it's Sheri. Are you home yet? Well, anyway, I'm coming to pick you up at 6:00. And you had better be ready. Your happy birthday begins at happy hour. See you soon. I guess in cat years we're about the same age, huh, Ripley? I don't know, Sheri. At 38 what the hell am I doing with my life, really? Seeing the world, having fun, you poor thing. What are you talking about? It's just at 38 I should just have more to show for my life. Like what? Kids? Husband? Ideally. But it's more than that. Ok, well do you see any future with the sexy pilot? I'm not moving there. He's not moving here. I think that plane has landed. Ok, so what then? I just don't matter to anyone. What? No, of course you matter. What if I was struck by lightning? What would they say at my funeral? Boy, that girl could really, you know, pass out those peanut bags. Well, I mean, you could- and this is just a suggestion- find a cure for cancer. Right? That'd be an amazing eulogy. Why do I tell you anything? Listen, I figure there's a zillion things you could do to save the world and make the world a better place if that's what you wanna do. You just gotta decide what it is and, I don't know, focus your energy on that. I don't have the same energy I used to have. Ok, so then that's step one. Ok? We take better care of ourselves. Yeah. -Bottom's up. -Drink up. [laughing] Grace Tanner? Yes, that's me. -Hi. -Hi. I'm Natasha. Nice to meet you. Welcome to the program. Thanks. Do you have any questions before we get started? Yes. A lot, actually. I'm a little dubious when it comes to words like "holistic" and "alternative medicine". I'm a little more western when it comes to these things. Dr. Carter is mainly a nutritionist so there's no chanting or crystals or any of that sort of thing. Well, that makes me feel better. That's why people come here. They don't feel sick, they just wanna feel better. Is that you? That is definitely me. Well, then, he's your guy. And I'm not just saying that because he's my dad. Paul: Well, just keep on doing what you're doing. You're out-pacing yourself. And we'll see you again in two weeks. Grace Tanner? Yes, that's me. Hi. Dr. Paul Carter. Lovely to meet you. I see you're new. I love it when new people give my program a try. We're gonna do great things. I hope so. Come on in. Thanks. Let's just get this on. Good. I just need a little blood, Grace. No need to be so nervous. I stopped using leeches months ago. I'm just not good with needles. Well, I am. I'm terrific with needles, so there's nothing for you to worry about. Ok. Connect with me. Ok. Just focus on me, alright? Don't look at the needle. We simply draw a little blood for analysis, see exactly what you need. Ok, just get it over with. It's already done. That's mine? Not anymore. I didn't even feel the needle go in. That's because I said "connect with me" and you did. You were listening to me and you weren't thinking about needles. So we're gonna do a full work-up, see what you're deficient in, see what maybe you have too much of, and then we're gonna tailor a program specific to your body type. You stick with it for six weeks and I promise you you're gonna feel like a new woman. Not like you're anything close to an old one. Are you with me? I'm all yours. [soft jazz music plays] ♪ [phone rings] Hello? Grace. Hi, it's Paul. Oh, Dr. Paul? Are you calling about my blood results? Uh, no. I'm uh, I'm just calling to check up on you and just make sure you didn't have any questions. Uh, no, no, I don't have any questions. Mmm-mmm. I mean, I'm sure I'll have questions along the way but I don't really have any questions right now. You don't have to call me "Dr. Paul", by the way. Just Paul is fine. Ok. Paul. Do you call all of your patients for night time follow-ups? Oh, uh, look, I'm really sorry, I didn't know if it was too late for you. No, I'm... I'm up, I'm just reading. I'm reading a book. Yeah, me too. I- I mean, I'm not reading, I'm just... it's- it's not too late for me but I know for some people, and of course you fly for a living so you probably have some very early morning wake-ups. I should be more aware of that I guess- you know, I'm just gonna- just gonna go ahead and shut up now. [laughs] [laughs nervously] Uh, well, I'm- I'm glad you called. Ok then. Uh, well I look forward to working with you, Grace. Yeah, yeah, me too. I'm looking forward to working with you, too. [sighs] So um, ok, well goodnight. Yeah, goodnight. [meows] [meows] What? He was just checking on a patient. [meows] You always read into things. ♪ Oh! There she is! Carlos, we need another Sea Breeze over here STAT. No. Carlos, I need a cranberry juice, please. No. Cranberry juice? What, are you pregnant? No, I've made those lifestyle changes, you know? Remember? We were gonna make some healthy choices? Oh, I didn't think we'd actually be doing them. And I'm also seeing this doctor and I gotta tell you, he is kind of a genius. Yeah? Well, I'm seeing a lifeguard and he's sort of a dingus. I mean, seriously. He's helpful and inspiring and he just, you know, he helps people. The exact thing that I was saying that I'm not doing in my life. Ok, so he's married, right? Divorced. But it doesn't really matter. That's not what the point is. Ok, so he's a hunchback then, maybe? No, he actually is very good looking. Ok. Well, he's doing something right because you look good. Thank you. I am feeling good. But if you think I believe for a second that you're not interested in a good-looking, inspiring, and available doctor, you have been drinking. [laughs] Whatever, Sheri. Oh, really? Then why are you blushing? [laughs] Cheers. So everything is looking pretty good, although your thiamine level is still a little low. Hmm. Have you been eating your cauliflower, young lady? Well, see, the thing about cauliflower is I kind of hate its guts and if there was a hell for vegetables I would probably like it to burn there for eternity. Ok, so that's a hard no on cauliflower. Are we asparagus friendly? Oh yeah. We're like this. You know, there is this place around the corner that makes an amazing roasted vegetable salad chock full of asparagus. Have you had lunch yet? I have an exercise that I think you might find really helpful. It can be sometimes a little bit obnoxious. You wanna try? Not really. Ok. Well look, hey, I can only lead you to water but I can't make you drink it. Ok, be obnoxious if you want. Alright. One question. Hmm. What can you teach me? I wanna know what, in your opinion, have you observed that you think can help other people? Ok, there's gotta be something. Well, I hope something comes to mind. You travel all over the world, you fly for a living, you work with people, you gotta learn something. Ok, energy is contagious, whether it's positive or negative. Well, why don't you give me an example? The first thing that pops into your head. Okay, so the woman in 14B, she's yelling at her son because he spilled her red wine and suddenly the entire environment on the plane becomes toxic and everybody is tense and uncomfortable and just one funny remark from me diffuses everything. Huh. What else have you learned in the sky? Turbulence happens. Paul? Hey. Oh, Tom. What're you doing here? Tom, how are ya? Uh, Grace, this is my friend and client, Tom Garvey. Very nice to meet you. Hi. Are you uh, you on Paul's program? Yeah, we just started a couple weeks ago. He is gonna change your life. I hope so. When I started working with Paul it was like the heavens opened up- Tom. He's making me sound like a cult leader. I am not a cult leader. Good to know. No, I think actually Grace here might be the one to make a real difference. Why don't you tell him what you were just telling me? No, it's not some brilliant insight. Well, let's let him be the judge of that. You wanna make a difference? Why don't you go ahead and start right now? [phone rings] Hello? Telemarketer: Good evening, ma'am. Are you happy with your long distance plan? No, my long distance plan is fine. Thank you. But if you give me just a moment, ma'am, I have some wonderful deals I- [hangs up] Why won't he call? Paul: Ok. Ok, great, see you next time. Grace. How are ya? Hi. So, you'll be happy to know everything looks really good. Thanks to you. Well, you did all the work. And um, well, I'm gonna miss seeing you every week. Yeah, me- me too. Maybe I should have told you your blood work looked lousy, that way you'd have to keep on coming back. Keep me in your clutches? Oh, come on, now. I'm not like that. [laughs] A warm embrace and my professional care. Now that you put it that way, yeah. Look, um... it's not very professional of me, I know, but uh, I think about you a lot. I uh, I felt a very strong connection to you the very first time you came in. Grace, I felt that deep connection ever since. Wow. I don't know that I expected... Please don't tell me I've misread this. No. No. No. Not at all. I... I feel the same connection.

Pretty much the same as when you called me when I landed at the gate. Well, that was a whole hour ago. I missed you, sweetheart. You sound like a 16-year-old. Well, you're the fountain of youth. [Paul laughs] Speaking of which, I would love to take a hot bath. How about I join you? I wish. The phone cord doesn't reach that far. Make a bet? [hangs up] Hello? Paul? [knocking] Who is it? Paul: Room service. What're you doing here? Well, I've always wanted to see Detroit. How about that bath? Yeah. Let's get dirty first. Oh, I like that. My whole life I would laugh at the idea of finding true love. But then Paul came along and I suddenly understood. The thought of him being locked in a cage for the rest of his life was worse than the idea of letting him go and never seeing him again. Oh. So I took him to the back yard, I said my goodbyes and off he flew. Stop, you're gonna make me cry. I'm gonna cry. I'm telling you, every time I see a blue jay I can't help but think that maybe it's a great-great- grandkid of my Louey-Bluey. I'm gonna get a refill. -Do you guys need anything? -No. Ok. Uh... [laughing] I approve. I gargantuanly approve. I know, right? Ok, so what's the other shoe? 'Cause there's always something. Oh, well... no, I mean, maybe sometimes he can be a little over-attentive, you know? Over-attentive? And you pick that as your gripe? [laughs] Oh, go easy on me. Up until now the only man in my life has been a cat named Ripley. [laughs] -Meow. -Meow. Grace. -Hi. -Hi. Merry Christmas. I can't believe it's you. How are you? -I'm great. -I know. You look fantastic. I'm in love. You're in love, wow. [laughs] Grace. Can I talk to you for a second, please? Oh, no, I just want to introduce you to my- Thank you. Hi, Captain. -Hi. -How are you? That was incredibly rude, what you just did. What the hell were you doing in there? What did it look like I was doing? I was talking to my friends. Oh, you were talking to your friends. His hands were all over you. I don't recall his hands being all over me. He was. Plenty. Look, he's just an old friend who was telling me that he got engaged. He was going on about his fiancé. [sighs] Look, I'm sorry, ok? Grace, I've just never felt this... these kind of feelings before. I've just never felt anything this intense for anyone. Really? Yeah. Baby, I've never loved anyone like I love you and I'm just kind of flailing a bit. Me too. I just feel 100 percent committed and loyal to you. You have my commitment and loyalty. Yeah? Yes. Ok, well- You have nothing to ever be jealous about. I think I just needed to hear it, that's it. You know what I mean? I'm sorry. And I love you. I really love you. ♪ ♪ ♪ It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

I have something I wanna show you, too. Ok, you go first. Frankly, I've been thinking about it since I... I've been gone. What the hell happened to you? You. You happened to me, Paul. You were rough on me when we- Oh, my god. No. That first-class passenger fantasy... No, sweetheart. Sweetheart, god. Why didn't you say anything to me? I did say something, you just didn't hear me. I must have gotten so caught up with it. I'm truly sorry. I know that you're sorry. God. Jesus. Just maybe no more role-playing and... Yeah, of course. Ok. No more.

You know the money we can make? I'm hearing "we". Yes, you're hearing "we" because I want you to be on my sales team. Huh? [laughs] Paul, I have a job. Look, you've been telling me since the very first time we met that, what? You've been looking for something more meaningful. This is more meaningful, sweetheart. I mean, this can actually help people. I mean, were you serious about making a change in your life or are you just talking on a whim? I don't know anything about this stuff. Well, they have a training program. You don't seem very excited about it. You know... I'm serious about it- No, you're not. Just forget it. I just- I am, I just- you just dropped it on me. Let me absorb it for a minute. And we could be together every day. Ok, it sounds- it sounds good and I... wanna make the time to do that. Are you serious? Yes, I'm very serious. Sweetheart, you don't have to quit flying right away. No, I know I don't have to quit flying. Listen to me. Hey, we're gonna have so much fun. [buzzing] Grace, come on. Girl's day. -Paul, hi. -Sheri, hi. What're you doing here? Oh, uh, I just came to fetch Grace. Oh. Uh, yeah. Grace is not home. What? No, we had plans. It's Sunday. Yeah, well um, she had to run out to work. She was covering for somebody. It was all very last minute. Oh. Bummer. Uh, when is she back? Listen, Sheri... Grace is not gonna be able to see you for a little while. What? What's going on? She just wants to make some changes and she doesn't want to slip back into old habits. Is this you telling me I'm an old habit? No, no, no. That's not what I mean. What I'm saying is that she's trying to live a healthier lifestyle. I didn't realize I was so unhealthy for her. She just wants to be free of temptation, that's all. Uh-huh. She's back tomorrow? Yeah two or three days, I'm not exactly sure. But I'll tell her you came by, alright? No need. I'll call her myself. Sure. [TV plays in background] [phone rings] Hi, this is Grace and Paul, leave us a message. [beep] Hey, Grace. It's Sheri again. Just calling to see if you're back in town. Give me a jingle if you are. Or I'll just call you back again. Hope you're well. Message deleted. [sighs] Chicago Four Towers. Yeah, uh, could I speak to room 1138? [ringing] Man: Hello? Who is this? You called me, buddy. Put Grace on the phone right now. I need to talk to her. Have another drink, pal. [hangs up] Hello? Hello? Don't do this to me, Grace. [ringing] Hello? Put that son of a bitch back on. Paul? Who is he, Grace? Who is- What're you talking about? The guy in your room. Baby, there's nobody in my room. You just woke me up. I just talked to him! What, do you think I'm an idiot?! Well, obviously they patched you into the wrong room. Don't lie to me! Why are you calling me at 2:00 in the morning? Because I can call you any damn time I want, that's why! Paul, I can tell that you've been drinking. There's nobody in my room and I'm gonna get some sleep because I have to get to work in the morning. Just sleep it off and I will call you tomorrow. Listen- [hangs up] Grace? Grace? Where is all this jealousy coming from, Paul? Look, I'm not even gonna- Because do you really think that I wanna be with somebody else? I don't. You need to get a handle on yourself. And what is this about telling Sheri that I don't wanna be friends with her anymore? No, that was- you said you wanted to make a change- That is my decision to make for myself. Ok, right. Alright, you're right. I'm sorry. Look, sweetheart, I think I might know what's going on. I go crazy when you're not around. You know this. I can't help it, ok? It's just the way things- and I'm sorry but I do it because I love you and I'm not gonna apologize for that. So what's the solution? Because I really want to help you. You become my partner at the company. I already brought Tom Garvey on, ok? To be part of my team. Our team, if you say yes. But if I leave my job I lose my pension and my benefits. -No. -Yeah. You won't. It's seniority. I've already called the airline. If you fly twice a month you get to keep all your benefits and your status. Huh baby, you would be so good at this. I don't think you understand it. You have a natural ability to connect with people. We could have way more money and we'd be working together every single day. How is that not a win, win, win? What do you say? Do you wanna be your own boss? Let me ask you guys a question. How many of you would like to help your fellow man? Come on, raise your hands. Alright, that's a lot of you. I'm a little impressed by that. Although, how many of you raised your hands because you knew you would kinda look like a jerk if you didn't raise your hands? [crowd laughs] How many of you would like to triple your income for good, for real, for life, and be your own boss of healthy living, healthy profits for a very long time? Right? All of you. I can see that. 'Cause you wanna be your own boss, right? Damn, Paul. She's a natural. Yeah. I sure know how to pick 'em. Working with Paul was fun. Business was going very well so we decided to buy a house in the countryside. Oh, it's so beautiful. You ready to make it your own? Yes. Paul? I was unpacking the boxes and I found these. And "these" would be? Legal papers, lawsuits. You are accused of being a Peeping Tom. Yeah. Uh, yeah, that. Um, so I used to live next door to this crazy woman who thought everyone was spying on her, but no, my love, I am not or was not a Peeping Tom. And this one says that a patient sued you for sexual battery and medical malpractice. It's a pretty big deal. Sweetheart, anyone can sue anyone. Why didn't you tell me about that? No, no, no. Not everybody has as many lawsuits as these. Well, I think you need to talk to more doctors because yes, they do. People tried to get money out of us. But all of that has been dealt with a long time ago. This one is actually more recent. This isn't a long time ago. So is this why you gave your business to Natasha? Unless I wanted everything I had worked for to go in the trash, then yeah, of course I had to put it in her name. But it's been dealt with. It's just legal BS that I had to deal- I'm asking you why you didn't tell me the truth. You said to me that you gave your business up because you wanted to reach more people and make a bigger impact. Yeah, what are we doing? We are making a bigger impact and we're reaching more people. You should be thanking me, for Christ's sake. No, I don't- What is this? What about this? Just give it to me, please? No! You know what? We're done with this! We're done with this! [slap] [smash] Oh, my god, Grace. Has he ever done anything like this before? No, I mean, he's blown his stack before but he's never hit me, no. 'Cause once would be enough for me. You know, I think it's really easy for you to say that, Sheri. What? Well, because you've just never been in a relationship for very long. Ok. We're talking about you being hit, Grace. [sobs] Honey. It's just... when it's good, it's great. If he's in a mood or he's drinking... but nothing is perfect, Sheri. I know. It's just when it's great, it's really perfect. But what happens if he does this again? If he does it again I'm gonna leave him. You have to make him understand- I know that. You gotta make him believe- Yes. Yes. Yes. Grace, please. It's just once. I'd sleep in the dog house if we had one. I've never been more sorry about anything in my entire life. Please. Please forgive me. You missed a spot. I ran out of paper. Baby, look. All that stuff in the past was lawsuits. They were just frivolous things. They don't mean anything, and I'm happy to talk about them anytime you want. Maybe some other time. Yeah. I'm sorry, too. Looking back on things now I should have seen what was coming. But I had never loved like that before. I saw what I wanted to see. [doorbell rings] -Hi. -Hi. For you. Oh, thanks. Welcome. The place looks great. How was your trip? It was awesome, thank you. Hey, buddy. Nice to see you. Thank you for coming. Nice to see you too. I wouldn't miss it. -Go on in there, grab a drink. -Sure. I thought this was gonna be a small party. Yeah, it was, but then I started calling people and it just... Well, I would have liked to have invited one or two people of my own. Yeah, but sweetie, then we'd end up with a house full of airline people. You don't mind sharing a bed with one. Honey, hey. Look, let me make it up to you. Okay. Uh, everybody? [clinks glass] Why don't you gather around here? I just wanna make a little- make a little toast. Um... it's a very special evening, um, and uh, tonight I wanna make this occasion even bigger. How do we do that you ask? Right? Well, I'll tell you. This woman has shown me rare commitment for the time we've been together and tonight I wanna show that I am completely committed to her. Grace, you had my heart the moment I met you. And tonight I'm asking you to take my soul. Will you marry me? [laughs nervously] Yes. [laughs] [crowd applauds] Give me a kiss. Why are you so nervous? [laughs] Congratulations. Woman: Congratulations Paul! No, I am happy. I don't know. I've just never been proposed to before so I guess I'm overwhelmed. Sheri: I've got a cure for that. It comes in bothin red and black label. I'm only an hour away. Say the word and I'm in the car. It's getting late. I better not. Grace, are we really not going to hang out anymore just because Paul feels insecure? You know what? We're just working through some issues and uh, I just think he needs me more than you do right now, so... Well, I don't need you, Grace. It's just I thought we were friends. Well, we are friends, I just need you to be a little bit more understanding. [door closes] Oh, um, I gotta go. Uh, I'll talk to you soon, ok? Ok. Love you. Bye. Love you too. -Oh, hey. -Who was that? It was Sheri. Does she wanna take you out partying like a couple of college girls? Mmm, I haven't seen her in a long time. Is that uh, is that why you've been so sad lately? It wasn't exactly lost on me that you weren't jumping up and down when I proposed to you. Well, you dropped on your knee in front of a group of people- So I mean, it was only really a problem unless you didn't wanna say yes. You put me on the spot. What else was I supposed to say? You didn't wanna say yes? Um... I just feel like we have some issues that we're still working through. What issues? Did you see I was drinking ginger ale the entire night? I did and I really appreciate it but you heard me. So what's the deal? I don't know. I- I guess I need you to be the Paul that I fell in love with. Sweetheart, you want me to be that Paul? I'll be that Paul. I promise you. Paul: Honey? Babe? Yeah? Where did you want the cat photo? What? Where did you want the cat? Oh, um... Up here? No. No, this one lower. -This one? -Yeah. Uh, no. Center it. Maybe on opposite sides. You know what? I don't think I like this on the wall after all. You know what? That is, as the philosophers say... Yes? The final straw! [squealing] [laughing] No tickling, please! The Paul I fell in love with was always there. The problem was he wasn't the only Paul I was living with. Good evening, madam, reservation for two. I am so tired. I have just spent the entire day... This is so sweet. Making you a five-course meal. I am so tired. I just- I don't think I'm gonna make it through the salad without passing out. Oh yeah. I was just in the air for 27 hours. Well, you know what? You will make it through because I have been cooking for the last five hours so you're gonna let me replenish you. Maybe we can just uh, start and then we can wrap it up and we can have two romantic meals. Oh, no, no, no, no. In one. Or two meals tomorrow. You are gonna get it- I'm so tired. -Nice and hot. We'll see. What do you mean, "we'll see"? What do you mean by that? I was just- I'm really tired. You asked me to be the Paul that you first met, right? And I'm being that Paul. This is better than that Paul. You- you cooked a beautiful meal for me. It's better than that Paul. No, this is A plus plus Paul. I never cooked for anyone in my entire life. And here you are, you're basically telling me to shove it. I'm not telling you anything, I just said that I wanna enjoy this. No, no, no. You don't have to enjoy the meal. Forget about it. It's over, ok? Paul. You know what? No. Forget it. Oh god. You went from zero to 100. Just- could you just please, can we just please talk about this? Grace, please just shut the hell up. Just... can we just- I said shut up!!! [table crashes] You know, Grace? You go away days at a time, all these far away places, Italy, France, Greece, Spain. Paul, Paul... -I don't know where you are. -Let's just talk. Maybe there's a reason you're so damn tired. Paul. You could be with anyone you want. Anyone you want! I don't have anybody I wanna be with. -I just- -What did you say? I- I said that I wanna be with you. I couldn't be with anybody- Are you threatening me? No, I'm just saying I... Oh, my god. You can be with anybody, huh? [gasps] Oh my god! Paul, please, please, please, please stop. Please. I'm begging you. Let me catch you. [sobbing] Let me catch you! Grace! Open the door, Grace! Just put the gun away! Open the door right now! Calm down and maybe we can talk. Grace, open the door! Please open the door, Grace. Just come out here and let's talk about it, ok? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Please. Why won't you even let me apologize?! Open the door! [gunshots] [gasping] [sobbing] [gasps] Hey! Hey! Hey! My fiancé and I have a very good relationship. It's just the alcohol, you know, when he drinks. It just changes him. And was he drinking when he fired shots at you? No, but he actually shot at me through the door way above my head and if he'd wanted to hit me he really could have easily. I really don't consider myself to be abused. Then why are you here? The truth is, I was scared to go to Sheri and hear her say "I told you so". And I was scared to go back home. This is Grace. You're going to be staying in here with her. Grace, this is Marina. Hi. Alright, I'll be back with some fresh pyjamas, a toothbrush and some soap, ok? I always think things'll change, but he's just so... I mean... No, he just won't change. This is my husband and it always will be. [sighs] Grace, does Marina's story resonate with you? Yeah, of course. Yes. But I'm not gonna be giving Paul multiple chances. This is it. Right now he's learning what life is like without me and I know he loves me. He's not gonna want to lose me. This'll blow over, it always does. Grace, when you say things like "it always does" you understand that you're implying multiple chances. Well, yeah, a few, but he's never pulled a gun on me before, ever. Grace, being a victim of abuse is nothing to be ashamed of. It's not your fault. I know that it's not my fault. Paul loses his temper sometimes and we talk about it all the time. And this particular incident happened because I had rejected something very, very nice that he was doing for me. Grace, look at me. You need to hear your own words. He got violent because of your rejection. Now, isn't that you saying that it is your fault? You know what? I'm sorry. That was definitely a poor choice of words. And I- I know exactly what you're saying and I know exactly how this sounds but I'm not trying to make any excuses, you know, defending him in any- any- in any way. Alright, I think that everybody here needs to really look at this chart and count how many of the warning signs apply to you. I already have looked at that. Hardly any of them. Grace. None of them should. [ringing] Paul: Hello? It's me. Grace, my god. Where are you? I've been sick worrying. I called everyone we know looking for you. Well, I guess you could have saved yourself some worry by not shooting a gun at me. What I did was inexcusable, ok? Look, I'm just calling to check on Ripley. Your cat's ok. Where are you? Are you feeding him? Everything is perfectly fine. Are you coming home or not? I'm just trying to figure things out right now. Where did that craziness come from? When did you even get a gun? I can tell you what my psychiatrist said if that helps any. You're seeing a psychiatrist? You don't think I should? I probably should have done that years ago. What did your psychiatrist say? That I'm bi-polar. What they used to call manic depressive. They got me on meds and everything. Are they helping? [beeping] Operator: Please insert another 25 cents- Paul? Hello? Hello? Operator: Please insert another 25- Hello? It's what they used to call manic depressive, I guess. He has really high highs and very low lows. Mmmhmm. It's those low lows that worry me. I understand. Anyway, that's why he's in therapy, you know? And I really think that he's overcoming the biggest obstacle of all. He knows he has a problem and he has to deal with it. Well, shooting at you really is a problem, isn't it? Well, see, shooting at me was just a symptom of the problem. He's chemically imbalanced. That's why he's on medication now. You know, if you want, my home is always your home. [meow] Oh, hey. There you are. Oh, sweetie, I missed you. [meow] Oh, so good. I thought that you were going to be in Atlanta at the convention. Yeah. I decided not to go. I didn't wanna go without you. I just came by to get Ripley. I'm gonna- I'm gonna stay at Sheri's for a little while. Is that where you were all week? I really gotta go, Paul. Grace, I uh, I... I'm sorry. I wish there was a bigger word than I'm sorry. I know that you're sorry but it's just not enough anymore. Please, just- can I just- will you just please hear me out? I wish I could just ask you for another chance but I know I can't because I blew it. That Paul. That guy from the other night. That wasn't me. That was... I don't know what that was but it scared me, too. [sobbing] I can see it so clear now that I'm on medication. It wasn't me. You're the only person that I've ever connected with. I don't want it to end like this, sweetheart. I don't wanna just let go of everything that we had because of one bad night. I don't. I gotta believe that I'm not beyond redemption here. You're not, Paul. You're not. [meow] If I were to stay you have to get rid of that gun. Yeah, of course. And if you ever put another hand on me again- I would never do that. That Paul is dead. Because I will never give you another chance. No more chances. I mean, I don't even deserve this chance. Baby, I miss you so much. I missed you, too. For long stretches of time, weeks, sometimes months, life with Paul was bliss. No one could make you feel more loved than he did. No one could ever make you feel more needed. What're you doing? I'm just looking at you. Go back to sleep. But months of happiness could be wiped away in a split second. Hon? Yeah? Yeah, the wildest thing, you know? I uh, I went out to get the mail and I found this letter there. I thought it was for me so I opened it, but it's- it's for you. Oh, thanks. Yeah. What's it all about? It's just from the Women's Shelter that I went to. I didn't know that's where you went. Um, so what is that, for, like, abused women? It's just- it was a place for me to go to get my head straight. I wonder why they're sending you letters. Baby. It's 'cause I told them I wanted to volunteer. I just... I didn't see you in that category. Abused women. No, I said to them that I might consider helping out women who are worse off than me. Well, I think it's a great idea. Thanks. Yeah. Oh, you brought me my shake. -Yeah. -Thanks. I like taking care of you. I like it, too. It's good. Thank you. Come on, let's go on that hike. What's the matter? Are you ok? I just- I fe- I feel really dizzy. Hey. Yeah. Oh my gosh, you're burning up. You must have caught a bug or something. I just need to catch my breath. Are you sure? Are you gonna be ok? Yeah, let's keep going. I'll walk ahead so I can keep an eye on you. Paul... Paul. Yes, sweetheart? I don't feel good. I need you to take me to the doctor. I am a doctor, sweetheart. You're fine. You just have to close your eyes and get some rest. You need to take me to the emergency room, please. This is not an emergency. Just a virus. You're gonna be fine. I have a fever. I know. I'm gonna take care of you, don't worry. Trust me. Close your eyes. Paul? [door opens] You're up. What did I tell you? Uh, Paul, the phone's dead. Yeah. There was an outage. Where were you? I took your car in to get fixed. What's wrong with my car? It had a really bad knock. I had to take a cab back here. When did that happen? Since it had a knock. Did they say when the phone lines would be back up? They did not. Oh god, I feel so nauseous. Yeah, you look pale. Why don't you get back to bed? I'll make you another shake. We'll get some nutrients in you. Ok. [blending] Grace... you're gonna need your strength if you want to fight this thing, darling. Here, drink up. I made- I made you this. I'm gonna leave it here for you, ok? Make sure you finish it. [knocking] Sheri: Hello? Grace? [knocking] Grace? Sheri. What're you doing here? Paul. I'm looking for Grace. What do you think? Paul: She's not home. She left. Good. So where is she? I don't know. Frankly, I don't care. You know, Sheri, you should know that I'm armed. Next time you decide to walk on my property. Are you threatening me? Get the hell out of here. [knocking] [sobbing] What's going on? I was just trying to wash the dishes and I- I- and I wanted to feed the cat and then I- I spilled all of the cat food- It's ok, it's just cat food. Relax. I have to go to the store to get other things anyway, I'll just pick some up. No big deal. No, I'll do it. I'm- I'm the klutz. I'll do it. No, no, no. You are not well. Hey, listen to me. You have to go to sleep. Ok. Just go lie down. I'll clean this up, go. Thank you. Go. I'll be right there. Ok. Ripley, baby? Let's get out of here. Hey! Please, please stop! What the hell are you doing? Um... wha- what's going on? What do you mean, what's going on? Um, I... why won't you let me in the car? Why- why am I walking? Are you ok? I... [meow] I don't know, I think I... I think I went to go get cat food. I got cat food. Get in the car. [blending] Here you go, sweetheart. Awe, thanks. These are really helping. Well, what did I tell you? I'm a little cold. Do you think you could get me a blanket? Yeah, of course. You just rest up. There you go, sweetheart. Oh, thank you. Thanks so much. I'm gonna go do some yard work. -I'll see you in a bit, ok? -Yeah. -Call me if you need me. -Ok. What're you doing, Grace? I was just crazed inside, just cooped up, so I thought I would help you with the yard work. You feeling up to it? Yeah. You're not feeling a little dizzy? No. Mmm-mmm. I feel much better. The shakes are making me feel better. I just don't want you to get lost, that's all. And have to hitchhike home. No, no. I'm fine. I just- I thought I might help you with the path maybe, a little bit. Stay where I can see you. Grace! When you left me did you ever even love me? Of course I loved you. Everything's crumbling, Grace. The company is a mess. We lost a lot of money. And it all started when poor, abused Grace decided to abandon me. You need to stop drinking, ok? You've had enough wine for the night. You don't trust me. I don't think you ever did, Grace. You think you're a prisoner here. But I caught you. And you were pretending to be all out of sorts. God, Jesus Christ, Grace. You must think... [glass shatters] I'm an idiot. But you know... I don't think you're... Like in every really great relationship, you make things better, right? We all know exactly when they start, right? Yeah. And we know exactly... how it ends. [yelps] No! [crying] No! No! [sobbing] You're hurting me! You never loved me. [sobbing] No! No! No! I don't understand. You wanna talk. [sobbing] Help! Please... All I was looking for was loyalty. [slap] Shut up! Why did you tell people I abused you? I didn't. -Why did you do that? -I didn't. Why did you do that? No! No! [sobbing] No. No. No. [moaning] This is the impasse, Grace. Now I'm gonna kill you. [sobbing] [sobbing] Grace! Grace! Grace! [panting] [sobbing] [gasps] What the hell's going on here? Call- call the police. Please call the police. Someone is out there trying to kill me. Please. Please. [sobbing] Grace! [sirens approaching] Paul escaped that night. The police looked for him everywhere but they couldn't find him. I had to go into hiding. Move to an island. Change my name. Rearrange my whole life. Detective Brooks: Take it easy now. I kept calling Detective Brooks hoping for good news. You call me if you need anything. But there were no signs of Paul. He had disappeared. Can I help you? Uh, forgive me. I- I thought you were someone else. Sorry to disappoint. No, no, it's no disappointment at all. I'm sorry, I still feel like I recognize you from somewhere. Hmm. Maybe from church? Do you go to First Congregational? [laughs] No, I don't go to church. It must be from um... Nutristave? You work at Nutristave? Yeah. That- I used to work there. Oh. Yeah, I'm Paul Williams. Neva Alvey. Neva Alvey. Wow, beautiful name. Thanks. Uh, do you want help getting in? I would love that. Let me give you a hand. Thanks. I come here all the time. Hello, this is Rachael at card services. It is urgent that you contact us- Tom: Hey Paul, it's me. Just uh, returning your call. Oh, shoot. You know what? I- I dialled the wrong number. I'm sorry. Oh, shoot. You know what? I- I dialled the wrong number. I'm sorry. He left that message two days after Paul attacked. I mean, he said that he dialled the wrong number so Paul must have been in touch with him with a different phone number. I just didn't catch it at the time. We went up and talked to Garvey two years ago. Yeah, but did you search his house? Every inch of it. I'm telling you that he is there, ok? This guy would have done anything for Paul. He would have known that you wanted to search his house and he hid him. But now he wouldn't expect you. You gotta trust me on this. Detective Brooks, right? Mr. Garvey. Um, I'm just wondering if we could take another look-see through your house? I- I don't understand. Why? Oh, we just wanna make sure we did our due diligence. You don't mind, do you? I mean, I- I feel like I've been more than cooperative. I don't see why my house is being treated as a crime scene. I mean, do you- do you even have a warrant, or? See, now Mr. Garvey, I gotta tell you, somebody says "warrant", I get a little suspicious. Let me in, please. [rumble sounds] Hey! Hey! Paul! Stop right there! Stop! What do you mean, cold? You had your eyes on him a week ago. He could have gone literally in any direction. Could be on the moon. Did you get anything from that Garvey? No, not really. I mean, he did say that Paul had taken up with some woman recently but he didn't have a name. She could be in real danger. We have an APB out, if he pops up anywhere we'll nail him. No disrespect, but you told me that before. He'll make a mistake. They always do. Even if that mistake is this woman's life? Get out of here, Grace. Can I just have two minutes of your time? I don't have anything to say to you. I don't believe that your father hasn't been in contact with you. You have got to be out of your mind. I don't know what possessed you to tell all those lies about my father but I will never forgive you. I haven't had a minute's peace since that night. I spend every waking moment looking over my shoulder- What about him, huh? You think he's had a minutes peace? You think he's not looking over his shoulder- I know you don't believe these things about your father but I am telling you that he is dangerous. If he's capable of doing what he did to me he's gonna do it to somebody else and I am begging you to help me prevent it. My father is innocent. Now get out of here. If I see you again I will call the police. Stewart: An energy bar? Paul: Not just an energy bar. Three energy bars, different flavours. I thought we were concentrating on the health shakes. We are, we are. But this is like all part of the same line of products. I don't know, Paul. I put a lot of money into those shakes. Maybe we see some return on them before we branch out. Of course. There will be returns. Neva: Alright, men. I'm expecting all of this to be eaten. There she is. Beautiful. Look at this. Looks amazing, honey. Fantastic. Yeah, am I a lucky son of a bitch, or what? I've always thought so. Thank you. Thank you. It's a good idea, so we should definitely look at the energy bar as the next step. Does that sound good? Absolutely, Paul. What the hell's this? What's the matter? It's- it's raw. It's not raw. It is. Look at this. It's blood red inside. I guess it could have used a few extra minutes. A few extra minutes? [laughs] What're you talking about? What, are you trying to kill me with e-coli over here? -Here it comes. -Paul, come on. What? Here it comes? You're the one that feeds me raw chicken and, what, I'm made to look like the bad guy? It's just a little under cooked. Hey! Goddammit, Grace. Keep up with the lip and you'll see what happens. I'm sorry. Every little thing I do, it's just like I'm walking on eggshells with him. -I'll talk to him. -Thanks. How's it going, Paul? Yeah, alright. I'm sorry about that. I'll go talk to her in a bit. Uh, I guess I must be just stressed out over the launch. I'm edgy, too. It's a big thing. Hey, who's Grace? Grace? Yeah, I'm being Sigmund Freud. You called Neva Grace up there. I did? Yeah. Uh... yeah. I guess you could say she's the one that got away. Who was she? Really, she's just a slut that betrayed me. This ex-girlfriend that I had. She started sleeping with this pilot. She came up with these BS allegations against me, some assault charges. I'm telling you, it scared the hell out of me. Had me on the run for a while. On the run, huh? Maybe you were the one who got away. [laughs] Let me get you a glass of wine. -Alright. -Let's go. Oh, you are definitely his type. I have got to find you. -Paul? -Yeah. What's this about? You realize this is just a bunch of nonsense, don't you? No, I don't realize that at all! This says your name is Paul Carter. Is that true? Well, look. I had to change my name because I was falsely accused by an angry ex-girlfriend who wanted to put me in prison. That's all there is to it. My god, Paul. It says rape, kidnapping, attempted murder. How do I know that's all there is to it? Because that's what I'm telling you. I mean, doesn't it make sense? She used to work at Nutristave. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I see what you're getting at. I found her name. She sent a Christmas card to Paul's daughter. It's a lead, for god sake's. What does it hurt to go check on her? I found the address. Please. [knocking] -Hey. -Hey. What's going on? Yeah. Neva left me a message, I called back but just got a busy signal. I got no idea what's going on with her. She went nuts over something stupid and then she locked herself in her room. Is she ok? Stewart, thank god you're here. I thought he was gonna hit me. Will you stop overreacting?! Everybody just needs to calm down. Now, let's talk this out. What happened? Yeah. Yeah, I have reason to believe the fugitive's hiding out at that address. Thank you, sheriff, I appreciate it. And listen, this guy, he's extremely dangerous. Yeah. Ok. They're on their way. You could say whatever you want, alright? I already told him all about it. I told him everything. Yeah, you did, but Paul, you gotta understand how this looks. You can't blame Neva for reacting. I think we should talk to the police. Ok, quit it with the police already. I've heard enough. Paul, I've known you long enough to believe you're telling the truth but obviously this is gonna follow you around until you confront it. I think Neva's right. Maybe we should just go to the police and tell them your side of the story. You're probably right. Yeah. Let's go to the police. Let me just get my coat. [sirens approaching] I don't know what would have happened if you didn't show up. He was like a different person. I honestly thought he was gonna hit me. [cocks gun] It's gonna be ok. Get on your knees. -Paul. -Paul. Get down on your knees! I'm not kidding! Get down on the ground! Paul! Paul, I wanna believe you but this isn't the way to convince me. Why did you have to bring Stewart into this? Baby, put down the gun. Shut up! Put down the gun! I said shut the hell up! Please! Grace, goddammit! [knocking] Tacoma police, open the door, please! [knocking] Tacoma police! Dammit, Neva! Paul, please! Please don't, Paul! Why?! [knocking] Open the door, please! Hi, ma'am. We're looking for a Neva Alvey. Is that you? No, Miss Alvey moved a few months ago. Is she ok? Paul! Paul! Dammit! Woah, woah, woah! Calm down. Please, please! Don't! Don't! [phone rings] Brooks. Goddamn it. Please don't. You're not getting away this time, Grace. [gunshot] [gunshot] Oh Stewart. Oh, Jesus Christ. [panting] [gunshot] I can't help but think that there's more I could have done. I knew he was gonna kill somebody. [knocking] [crying] I know now what it looks like to look into the face of a man who has professed to love you fully, unconditionally, and forever, and then watch his lips form the words "I'm going to kill you". How I wish I could have warned you. Would you have listened? Although I'll never know you, Neva, in many ways I feel I do. I'll always be heartsick that I could do nothing to change what happened to you. Unfortunately, there will always be others who are trapped like we were. When I look at all the warning signs today I'm amazed I never realized that every one of them applied to me in some way. I want to help other women recognize it when something can be done, and we can't ever blame ourselves for the abuse we suffer. In the end we can't blame anybody but the monster. Sincerely, Grace.
