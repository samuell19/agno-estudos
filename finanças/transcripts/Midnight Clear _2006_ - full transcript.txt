[wind blows] You alive in there? Yeah. You're 15 minutes late, Lefty. Dale's lookin' for you, and he's more pissed than usual. You hear what I said? Yeah. I'm comin'. Hey. What? Thanks for making me late. Gee, I'm sorry. My boss, who pays me, wanted me to do something. Next time I'll tell him I work for Lefty. [water running] [door opens] Hey, princess. When you're done puttin' your makeup on, get your royal behind in my office. Say, Dale, I'm gonna need an extended lunch today, seein' as I got a meeting with my wife's lawyers. You must be joking. No, Dale, I'm not. Now, I know that you're... Come on, Lefty. What's wrong with you? Am I nuts, or did we have a conversation yesterday? What wasn't clear about what I said, Lefty? Didn't I warn you that was the last time? We talked about it. What else can I do for you? I got you the promotion. Nobody else thought it was a good idea, but I pushed it, and you thank me by being late every day since. Every day. How is that possible? You think this is funny? I can't believe I wasted my time on you. Look, Dale... I appreciate the promotion. I do. But you gotta understand. Now that I'm makin' more money, I'll admit I've been partyin' a little bit more. But that will not... affect my work. Please tell me you're not that stupid. I gave you a promotion. You didn't get a raise. Assistant Production Line Supervisor? It doesn't mean a thing. It's just a name. I did it for your custody case because I knew it'd look good for the judge and your kids. But you... you take that... that... that charity, and you blow it up in my face. I'm not blind. I know you're drinkin' again. You're hopeless, Lefty. Sucks to hear it, I know, but somebody needs to tell you. I'm sorry, man. I gotta do it. Now, Dale, before you go and do somethin' stupid, you really ought to think about it. I mean, this place would shut down without me. Who else is gonna go out there and change all those belts on the line? Anyone with opposable thumbs. Playtime's over. Clear out your locker and go home. You're fired. An escort will walk you to your car. Now, Dale... Go home, Lefty. Hi, Jacob. How you doin', buddy? Hi, Mary. You doin' okay? Fine, thanks. You? Seriously. You doin' all right? As good as can be expected. Seriously. [chuckles] I love you, Jacob. You be good. Love you. His juice box is in his backpack. He'll try to tell you I forgot to give him one... Got it. Hey, you know these seats are adjustable. Oh, yeah. This is the way Rick liked it, though, so... I just, um... you know. Yeah. Okay. See you at 3.I'll see you at 3. Bye. [starts engine] [doorbell chimes] Pump one. [bell chimes] [keypad beeping] [register whirring] [doorbell chimes] This plus 20 bucks on 2. 21.05. [keypad beeps] [keypad beeping] [register whirrs] Problem? No, it's really good, actually. [bell chimes] [drawer closes] [Lefty] Where's Security? The least they could do is have Security take me out. Security's got sensitivity training today. Yeah, well, this isn't very sensitive. Yes. Go home, Lefty. It's kinda hard when you're standin' in the middle of my livin' room. Yes. Good luck, buddy. [starts engine] Hey! Got a fiver? Just till payday? I'll show you playtime, Dale. [Male voice] ...to consider the feelings of the violator, at least on par with those of the violated. We mustn't forget, before they were perpetrators, they were victims themselves. So they are hurting individuals, deserving of our empathy, concern, and, yes, our love and compassion. Perhaps you can ask, them, brother... or sister... if... if they're comfortable with that, "Why is it that you felt compelled to take what did not belong to you?" [tires screeching] [car horn honking] It's prepay only. I don't care what day it is. I guess that would explain the sign right in front of my eyes that says "Prepay only," huh? It kind of sucks working today, huh? Christmas Eve and all? Huh? Working Christmas Eve. No fun. Oh. Yeah. I guess. Boss gave you the raw deal. You're looking at him. Oh. Then why the heck are you working today? Kid didn't show up today. Called in sick this morning. What else am I going to do? Kids aren't the most dependable creatures. 20 bucks on 2. So you even have to be open today? Chug-a-Lug and Neighbor Mart are closed. It would be stupid to pass up the Christmas Eve rush. Oh. Yeah. 27.01. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Yep. Hello? Uh, is, uh... I was... Is this the walk-in clinic? Oh, good. I was afraid I had the wrong number for a minute. Um, um, I... I saw Dr. Lyndel yesterday, and I'm... I'm a little confused about some of the medications he gave me. I think I need a little help w... Uh, yeah, I can wait, okay. Uh, hi. This is Eva Boyle. Yeah, I saw Dr. Lyndel last week, and I was wanting to... Oh. I wasn't expecting you, Dr. Lyndel. Oh. What... No. Uh... I know it was yesterday. I told that woman that. Anyway, I know you told me to take some medications in the morning and some in the afternoon... I did? I did. I wrote it down right here. Oh. Now I do feel silly. Well, uh, which... Uh-huh. Yeah, the... Oh. The red with the red and the yellow with the yellow. [sigh] Thank you so much. I... I know I wasted your time, but I just remember your telling me that I need to be careful which ones I took with which and when. Oh. Thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too, Doctor. Thank you. Ah, Mitch. Putting the music together. Hey, Pastor Mark. Yeah, I'm almost done. I put these packets together for you to give out. There's a card, a Christmas CD, and 20 bucks in each one. Isn't this kind of insulting? No. I don't think so. I want to give them something they need rather than some kind of tree ornament or a candy cane or something. I'm just not sure how they're going to take it. I... I gather you're not, uh, excited about tonight? Not tremendously, no. I mean, we're talking about high school students here. The last thing they want to do is go caroling for old people. I mean, it's not 1948 anymore. Fair enough, Mitch, but maybe I'm not too concerned about what they and you want to do. Not every act of service is a joyride. Is this about, uh, what day it is? I know the accident was a year ago tonight. Maybe, I guess. Uh... You know, this can be good for you. Most of the people you're visiting tonight are shut-ins. You're the only person they're going to see over the holidays. Others, they haven't been here for a while. They're not sure if the church still cares about them. Yeah. We've been through this. Well, let me put it in another way. Not everything with the kids has to be cool or hip. It's good for them to just do some ministry once in a while, hmm? I don't... I don't know. Man, I'm just feeling... [sigh] I feel like I'm up against a wall with some of these kids. I mean, they're all great. It's just... They haven't decided if I'm worth listening to, and I'm afraid this sort of thing is gonna push them over the line, and... and once they're on the other side, just bury me and hire a new seminary grad. At least you're overly dramatic. I'm sure they can identify with that. Okay. You want them to decide you're worth listening to? Be worth listening to. Show them a faith that makes you want to do stuff like this. Ah. See you at the services later. All right. Later. Oh, and, Mitch... technically, old people are still people. I'm not sure that's true, but I'll look it up on the Internet later. Yeah, do that. Lucio Boyle? Don't get up. I'm Gordon Macintosh. I'll be working with Samantha representing your ex-wife from here on out. I know you two have met, and this is Greg, our file clerk. Lefty. Excuse me? Lefty. His nickname. Cute as it is, we won't be using it today. I'm sure you'll understand. I'll call you back. Everyone calls me Lefty. Lefty. Of course they do. If my parents had named me Lu... I'm a lefty, too. Born that way. Oh, in my case, it's a little weird 'cause I'm not even left-handed. Uh, where is your representation? My lawyer and I, we don't see eye to eye on a few things, so... You don't have a lawyer. Right. Anyways, when I was growing up as a kid, we didn't have a whole lot of money, so every time I wanted to play ball, I had to borrow my brother's left-handed baseball glove, and because of that I really wasn't any good, and all the kids that I played with, they didn't know I was right-handed, so they just thought that, uh... well, they just thought that I wasn't any good. All rightie. Greg, we need mochas. Mr. Boyle, you realize you have a right to have representation with you, and since you've chosen not to have counsel at this hearing, you waive all rights to such protection as would be provided by state statutes regarding said representation. You're okay with not having a lawyer here. Right. Good. Then I'll speak my mind. I advised the court against this. I think you're a terrible father, and I don't think... I think what Miss Lewis is getting at is that this agreement is tenuous at best. We know this, your ex-wife knows this. It's important that you know it, too. So I strongly suggest you do everything in your power to retain your newly-acquired visitation privileges. I just got a promotion. I'm going to be getting a much nicer place very soon. I still think... Maybe we should just fill out this paperwork and be done. We just need to verify a few things and get some signatures. Are you still at 4742 Alcott Avenue? Um... No. What's your current address? It's a little complicated. Um, see, while I'm waiting on the promotion money, which is going to take a minute, I got a landlord... he's like... Like a real Nazi landlord. He, uh, he's just not willing to let me slide for a couple of weeks, so... Are you saying you don't have an apartment or a home or any sort of shelter, Mr. Boyle? No, I got shelter. I just don't have an address at the moment. What are you, living in your car? I don't believe this. Mr. Boyle, no court in the world is going to grant visitation privileges to someone who's homeless. We... We can't go through with this today. Uh, the court says that I can have visitation. I mean, that's a done deal. Greg, call civils courtroom and ask for a new hearing, whatever it takes. Unbelievable. Please. My kids should see me. I'm going to get a new place as soon as I get a new job. A new job? I thought you said you just got a raise. It's complicated. I did get a promotion, and I got fired right after that, so... I'm sorry, Mr. Boyle, but we're going to have to report the information you gave us to the court. We'll be in touch with you as soon as a new hearing date is set. But I'll get to see my kids up until then? I'm afraid that can't happen. I'm sorry. Try to have a good day. This will make things easier. Oh, you are getting so big. I can barely hold you. Hey, guy. Hey. How'd it go? Good. Yeah? Yeah. Hey, we're going to go visit Daddy. I know. So you ready? Yeah. Okay. [dialing] [sigh] Hello. This is Eva Boyle. Uh, I've got my checking account there, and I'd like to close it, please. Uh-huh. My mother's name... Maiden name is, uh... Slade. That's what it is. Slade. How much? $9.52? No, no. Don't send it back to me. Uh, just, uh... uh... Send it to the Salvation Army. I bet they'd be able to use it, don't you think? Uh-huh. I understand. It's... yeah. Same address. Merry Christmas to you, too. Thank you. Yes, sir. We got that on back order. We'll get it right out to you. Abso... Hello? Dang it! Stupid cell phone. Excuse me, sir? Buddy? I just lost a very important phone call. Could I borrow a cell phone just for one minute? Thanks. Absolutely, sir. We'll get it right out to you. We have it on back order right now. Hello? Stupid... Sir, I just lost a very important business call. You don't have a cell phone I can borrow, for just a minute, do you? Well, what happened to your phone? It just hasn't been the same since I dropped it on my boat. Your boat? What is this thing? You were just on this? Right. Just now? Yes, sir. It's a very important business call. All right. Well, just for a minute. I have a 2:00. Great. Me, too. Thanks. Heather? It's me, Lefty. I know it's you, Lefty. What's this number? A friend. Whatever. How'd the meeting go today? Oh, you ought to know. Everything was fine until those stupid pit bull attack dogs lawyers of yours screwed me over again. I knew this was going to happen. What are you talking about, Lefty? All you had to do was sign the papers. Yeah, I know. That's what the court said. And then your freaking lawyer said I've got to come back into the court and have another meeting with the judge. I'm getting sick and tired, Heather. Lefty, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Why wouldn't they let you sign the papers? Because you and your new boyfriend don't want me to see my kids. You know that's not true. As long as you're sober. We've been through this. Besides, it doesn't matter what I want. The judge said you can see them, so you can see them. Tell that to your freaking lawyers! Lefty, would you please calm down and tell me what happened? Look, all's I know is they told me if I don't have an apartment, I can't see the kids. Listen, I really need my cell phone... Just give me one more second, buddy. This is very important. I'll be there in one minute. Hello? What happened to your apartment? I don't want to talk about it right now, okay? So why don't we lay off it! Whatever. What else did they say? They said I couldn't see the kids. How many freaking times do I have to tell you that? Listen, I really, I got to... Buddy, just back off, fella! Please. I told you this is a very important business... call. I'm telling you right now, Heather, this whole thing ain't right. And if it don't get fixed, I'm going off on somebody. Where are you, Lefty? All I know is I'm in the office with your pit bulls. One minute I slip and tell them I got fired, and they're out of there like bats out of hell with their cappuccinos spilling all over themselves. You got fired. Hey! Is that this gentleman's phone? One second, please. I got to go. Buddy, you got to go. What's the matter with you? Get out of here. What's the matter with you? Are you across the street again? Knock it off. Okay? You... You got problems. [engine starts] All right, guys. Listen up. Here's the deal. Are you listening? Now, there's a rumor going around that caroling is a dorky thing to do. I just want you all to know that unfortunately it's not a rumor. Caroling is a dorky thing to do. So don't sweat it. We're in this thing together, so let's make this fun. Got it? Yeah. You with me? Yeah. Yes. I said are you with me? Yes.Yes. You're all very hip. Come on. Let's go. [engine running] Hi, Mary. Hi. I'm glad you came in today.[chuckles] Hey, little man. How's it going? Merry Christmas. We've been working on that one. Can we go see him? Of course you can, honey. I'll call down and make sure he's in the TV room. Oh. And, Mary, he had kind of an angry spell this morning. He had to be chemically restrained again. He's not going to be very lucid tonight. Okay.

You like it? Yeah. I like it. Merry Christmas. Honey, you don't have to get that close. Daddy can hear you. He just... He can't show you right now because of the medicine. Oh.

So much like you, it freaks me out sometimes. Oh, he advanced another round in the spelling bee this week. He and Sammy Jarvis both get to go to the district competition right after New Year's. I'm going to take work off and go see it. It's hard, Rick. So hard. There is no one I can really talk to about this.

I'm going to stop talking now. It's okay. You're right. I really did get screwed on this deal, huh? [laughter] Hey, why don't you come to church tonight? We haven't seen you there since it happened.

No, we're still here. No, not home, just... It doesn't look like we'll be there tonight. Well, the car's shot, and I can't get anybody to look at it right now. Yeah, it's... I know. It's lousy. I know. What am I supposed to do about it? Mom, everything is closed. I can't just rent a car tonight. I'm going to have to see if anybody can drive in the middle of nowhere on Christmas Eve and give us a ride back home. Honey, come here. Stay by me right now, okay? Mommy's on the phone with Grandma.

Just a reminder you, uh, haven't been, uh, forgotten. Thank you again. Merry Christmas. Moving right along. Is that bad? Yeah. I think it's pretty bad. Can you fix it? If I had an air filter, but I don't carry that sort of thing here. It's a convenience store. Well, that's not very convenient, now is it? I've heard that one a few times. Sorry. Oh, wow. This is another problem. When was the last time you had a tune-up? A what? Oh, uh, that would be last Christmas. Probably the fall before... Before that, actually. Rick, my husband, thought that a fall tune-up would be just fine for Christmas travel. You're lucky it's running at all. The points are trashed. The filter's disgusting. I can't imagine what the oil must look like. Last fall? Why didn't you bring it in after that? Rick always handled things like that. Why did he let it go so long? Well, that's a loaded question. Rick was in a car accident last year. He lives in a home now. Sorry. No, it's okay. But it... it left him brain damaged, and they're not sure what kind of recovery he could have, if at all, so... Anyway, he hasn't been in the mood to take the car in for a tune-up this year. I can tell you that. S... I suppose you'd like to make it to your folks' place tonight, huh? You know what? I appreciate you even trying. I do. If you help me, we could jerry-rig the points and plugs, clean up the cap a bit. Um, we could change the oil. I do have oil here. How convenient is that? Take the air hose. I'll blow out this filter. Maybe we can get by without a new one. If all goes well, and that's a huge if, we'll have you on the road in a couple of hours.

Well, I understand, but I didn't ask for anything. Oh, no. Um, someone gave us your name, and we bring meals to people who may need a little extra... assistance.

No. I'm saying that I don't need a meal. How'd you get my name? Well, we're not supposed to say, but... I think it was from Dr. Lyndel at the Jefferson County Walk-in Clinic. He's your sponsor. Uh, my notes say that you told him you had a family of six coming for Christmas dinner. Is that true? Oh... I did talk to Dr. Lyndel about my family. Yes, I did. So they are coming over for dinner? Huh? Uh, yes, they are. Oh, well, I guess Dr. Lyndel was just trying to help out. I mean, six people. Uh, well, uh, come on in and bring it into the kitchen. Here. I was starting to think we'd have to take Dr. Lyndel in for a checkup. Oh, I don't think he needs that. Okay. Now, this turkey is warm, so it'll be good for the next couple of hours, you know, if the dinner's tonight. Otherwise, in the morning, you can heat it up for an hour on 275. Thank you so much. Oh, and when you're done, just toss the containers. Oh, that's fine. Thank you so much for all this lovely food. My family's going to be delighted. They'll think I'm a wonderful cook. Well, I hope so. Oh, and, Mrs. Boyle, you have nothing to be ashamed of. What do you mean? You have cooked enough meals in your life. You can take a break now. Oh.

[sighs] [Carolers knocking on door]♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night [sighs]♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright [knocking] I'll be there in a minute! ♪ Round yon Virgin ♪ Mother and Child ♪ Holy Infant ♪ So tender and mild ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ [Carolers] Merry Christmas! Oh... thank you all so much. I... I would have some cookies for you, but my grandchildren ate them all. Oh, stop it. We just wanted to stop by, tell you we've missed you at church. I've been travelin'. Uh, my family's all spread out. Really? Well... Will we see you at the service tonight? 10:45 sharp. Well, give or take. Service will last till midnight. We can stop by, pick you up. I'm afraid not. Um, I have, um, my family's all comin' tomorrow. Maybe next week, then. Well... you take care of yourself. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [sighs] "O" for seven. But the singing is getting better. Really? No. But... they probably can't hear it anyway, so... The packet. You forgot to give her the packet. Packet. You know what? I really don't think that she... Oh, come on. Wants to... She might need it. It's what it's for. [sighs] Crap. Hold on. [knocking] [sighs] I nearly forgot. A gift... from the youth group. I... I don't need anything. Just a small something. [sighs] Uh... let you know how much you're loved... and missed at the church. Oh, thank you very much. You okay? I'm fine. You sure? Is there anything I can do to... No. Please. I'm fine. All right. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [sighs] [coughs] [sighs] [sighs] [chuckles] [weeps] [weeping] [sniffles] Are you okay, Mitch? Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, guys. I think we're gonna call it a night. So... tell me more about your husband. What's he do? Well, nothing. Yeah. [chuckles] Right. What didhe do? Oh, wow. What didn't Rick do? When we were first married, he was an engineer. He always joked he'd never stop until he'd built the perfect mousetrap. Then one day, he comes home and tells me he's quitting. Just like that? Yeah, just like that. And he did! The next thing I know, he's workin' at a ranch for at-risk kids. Wow. Talk about a pay cut. He also volunteered at our church. Mostly with the youth group. He'd help anybody who needed it. He sounds like a real jerk. Uh... um, that was supposed to be a joke. I'm sorry. Uh, it... it's okay. It's just that he can't help anyone now. It's like his purpose has been... taken away. You know, my mom had a stroke towards the end of her life. What's that? My mom. She had a stroke. She couldn't take care of herself anymore. I'm sorry. So you know. Well, it's not the same as you and your husband... but, uh, my sister and I did have to take care of her. My dad... he just couldn't deal with it, I guess. Yeah. A lot of people can't. It's funny, though. It... I'm grateful for that time. I mean... it's easy to take care of someone who gives back or says "Thank you." But taking care of someone who doesn't even know what you're doing... it... it makes you figure out what kind of a person you really are. You know? Yeah. I mean... uh... I'm not saying that's why... why this happens. It's... just that's what Igot out of it, anyway. Huh. I wish other people saw it that way. Other than the pastor of my old church, no one visits him regularly. They... They all just feel too awkward. They don't know how to talk to him. I'm embarrassed for him. [Man on radio] You'll be giving those out all the way to the new year. It is 9:32 on the night before Christmas. Not a lot of traffic out there, but we do want you to drive careful and be safe. Please don't stay out too late tonight. Well, this was unexpected. How's that? Nothing. I just wasn't planning on... Didn't think you'd have a meaningful conversation with the gas station guy, huh? No. Not that. I... It's okay. I understand. I know what this place is. I'm not proud of it. So, then what are you doin' here? When I bought it, I was a genius. It's... out in the middle of nowhere, but the city limits were headed this way. I was... I was gonna sell it. Reinvest. Make a fortune. But the city just never made it, and I got stuck here. Uh, so I... I figured, uh, maybe I'd have a chance if I made it a different kind of a gas station... A destination-type place, you know? Uh, gourmet coffee? Good food? Great service? Clean as I could get it? Problem was I did all that, and no one gave a rip. So it's never gonna be a destination for anyone. It's just a stop along the way. I don't know. You know... you think about that one thing that you can contribute. What's my thing? That I make a good pot of coffee? Most of my customers don't care about gourmet coffee anyway. They want gas and a Styrofoam cup of pennies by the register. That's about it. [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] [crickets chirp peacefully] Tonight's the anniversary. Of the accident? Yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah. He was a good man. He is... a good man, but he wasa good man. I still love him so much. I meant what I said. You know, in my vows... "For better or for worse." All of it. Yeah. [sighs heavily] Are... you okay? Yeah. I just... I haven't had a chance to breathe about this for a while... between fighting for him and... dealing with his friends and staying strong for Jacob. I just... I haven't even cried in months, so... [weeping] Hey, guys. Welcome back. Brett. Gretchen. Hey, good to see you. How'd it go. Not bad. Yeah? It was cool. Hey, everybody, head upstairs. Bathroom break, and then free time until the service. So? What's to say? We did our duty. We sang for some folks, invited them to church. But they shut their doors and went back to their lonely lives. You... handed out the packets? We did. That's good. You know... I'm still not sure what value all this had. Maybe you never will. So, what's the point, then? None of them are gonna be coming to church tonight because of our visit. They... They didn't care. And the kids sure aren't gonna get anything out of it. I mean... I just... You know somethin', Mitch? You go out and serve God with that attitude, there's a good chance that nothing will come of it. Maybe this is a test for you. I don't know. Sometimes you do the right thing because it's the right thing, hmm? Geez, you sound like a pastor or something. And, look, you don't know what's gonna come of tonight. I got it. I got it. [tearfully] It's just tonight... of all nights. You know? I mean... before, a year ago, when Rick was here, he mattered. He was important. He had good ideas. The kids thought he was exciting. And now it's a year later, and we've got him tooling around, singing on porches. Badly, I might add. I hear you, Mitch. I do. I want to talk to you about this, okay? Can we talk after the service? Yeah. Great. Thank you. You know... there was something tonight... kinda odd. Um... Eva Boyle. Is she a little off? Something didn't seem quite right, and... and I don't know what it was. Yeah, Eva Boyle. I, uh... She's kept a lot of our church ladies on their knees for a long time now. Her husband's been dead ten years. He was terrible. Her family's scattered all over. Some of 'em, she hasn't seen for years, and from what I hear, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Huh. You sure about that? She said they were all comin' to see her tomorrow. No. Not likely. That's great. [chuckles] I'm glad I followed my instincts. [chuckles] Listen. Why don't you follow up with her sometime? I can go with you. Mitch, I know you didn't want to, but you did the right thing tonight. It was good for the kids, too. Yeah.

Hello? What are you doing here? It's me. I know who it is. Why didn't you answer the door? Because I didn't want to be bothered. Right. I'll just, uh... No. What... What are you doing here? I came by to, um, just get somethin'. Well... Give me your jacket. I'll keep it on. I'm not stayin'. How's Heather? She ran out on me two years ago, Ma. Well, how would I know that? Right. Life doesn't always turn out as we hoped, does it? You have no idea. The hell I don't. The kids. They okay? Heather won't let me see 'em. Now what have you done? Ma. All right. What do you want? Lucio, I... You... You scared me half to death. Lefty, Ma. Lefty. Oh, for heaven's sakes. You're not even left-handed. All right, Lefty. You came here... to this house... on this night... for no reason? I got a reason. Well, what is it? I came to wish you a Merry Christmas. Actually, that ain't right. I came here... so you could... wish me a Merry Christmas. You... You need me to wish you a Merry Christmas? Well, why would you... Why... 'Cause you're my ma. That's all. Well, Merry Christmas. Okay. I'll just be goin'. No. No, no. Wait. Please. I... I'm sorry. Um... it's just... all so unexpected. Yeah, I know. Uh, let me make you some tea. Uh, are you hungry at all? I... I've got leftovers. Ma... No, please. Come on. It'll just take a minute. [chuckles] I gotta say... you're the best thing that's happened to me all evening. That right? You ever hear a group of teenagers sing "Silent Night"? [laughs] Not silent enough, huh? Definitely not. [chuckles] Lucio, no! Oh! What? Ma. Oh, you didn't drink any of that, did you? No, Ma. Oh... I'm sorry. I've got a cold. I just don't want you to get sick. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Ma... you all right? I'm fine. It's Christmas Eve. Are you goin' to church? Oh, those Christmas carolers asked me that this evening. I told 'em I didn't think I was gonna make it there this year. How come? Well... I don't have a car anymore. What about the bus? They changed the route last year, and now the closest stop is all the way on the other side of the four-lane. [sighs] Oh. Here. Sit down! Come on. It's just gonna be ready in a minute. Get you a napkin. Get all ready. It's just gonna be a minute. Hey. Hi. [sighs] So, tell me. What were you gonna do with your fortune? [chuckles] I don't know. I didn't get that far. Does it really matter? That's the second time you've said that. I, for one, am glad you didn't sell this place and move on, 'cause I'd be stuck out here in the middle of nowhere tonight trying to get a new AAA account. Yeah, that's true. See? It was all worth it. [chuckles] Thanks. That changes everything. [laughs] Oh, anyway, it was... it was good to talk about it. So thanks. Yeah. Why don't you hang out with Jacob, okay? I should be able to knock the rest out myself, okay? Your brother just won't have anything to do with me anymore. Think he blames me for your father. Kevin's too good for all of us now. I wouldn't waste my time waitin' on him. You hear anything from your sister? Nope. Me, neither. Three years. Last I heard, she was still... dancing. The kids used to write me, but now I don't know what's goin' on. Is that right? That girl's had a death wish since junior high. I don't know how she made it as far as she did. Well, it wasn't really that far. [sighs] I'm sorry about you and Heather. I wasn't exactly Man of the Year. Well, just don't you lose touch with those kids. It's no fun when your kids stop talkin' to you. Okay, Ma. I get it. I'm just sayin'. I get it. All right. I get it. Your cousin Jeff just had another baby. What's that, two now? That makes four. I don't know how he affords it. I don't know. I haven't seen it, but I hear it's a beautiful baby. You know, Ma, I got a car. Okay... If you wanted to go to church, I can take you. You'd do that for me? Right. If you needed me to. Well, that would be wonderful. I would like it. I really would. Would you really do that? If you needed me to. Would you go inside with me? I don't know. Oh, please. Go inside with me. If I walk in there, Ma, the place might burst into flames. I'm gonna go get dressed. You look great. Here. Sorry for the spill. Thanks. Your father called those his... Church shoes. Thank you for this, Lucio. You're welcome. You'll... You'll take some of this food, won't you? Oh, I don't have any room for it right now. Oh, it's way too much for me. Please take it. Maybe you could bring it to church. Oh, that's a good idea. I'm sure they'll know somebody who needs it. Well... we should... we should get going. Ma, we got a problem. [sighs] I don't have any money. If we're gonna go to church, we'll need gas money. Oh. I don't have any.

Why don't you go turn off the TV. Just hold on. Hey. Look, by law, I can't give you that card back. It's okay. I got cash. All right. Oh, you two are back, huh? Yeah. Car broke down.
