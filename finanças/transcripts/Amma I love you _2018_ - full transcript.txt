'There are certain questions that children ask their parents..' '..and so do you.' 'Mother, where is the socks? Where is the soap?' 'I am not finding the towel. Where is it?' 'What about my shirt? I had kept my pant right here. Where is it?' 'What about my watch? The phone charger?' 'Where are the headphones?' 'Mom, where are the keys to the bike?' What about my lunch box? Where is the remote control of the TV? 'Where is my phone? Where's my wallet?' 'Where is the pen and where's the paper?' 'Where is my spectacles, mom? Oh, my God.' 'We would've asked several such questions to our mothers..' '..but we ask only one question to our fathers.' 'Father, where is mother?' 'Though we talk harshly to her, she responds very politely.' 'Mom, make 'Dosa' not 'Idli'.' 'Don't make 'Puri' make 'Chapati'.' 'Don't make chutney make curry.' 'Don't make mutton.' 'My friends are coming home make chicken.' 'Don't make tea make filter coffee.' 'My mother makes everything I ask for selflessly.' 'My mother is a sweeper, cleaner..' '...keeper, chef, waiter and teacher.' 'My mother is an organiser, decorator..' '..story teller, singer, actor and an entrepreneur.' 'My mother is a bargainer, treasurer, financial advisor..' '..supporter and motivator.' 'She reminds me when I forget to take my things.' 'We need our mother for everything.' 'It takes a moment to be a father..' '..but it takes a lifetime to be a mother.' 'This is our small tribute to all the mothers.' 'Mom, I love you.' Welcome to India, sir. Welcome, sir. - Thank you. Welcome, sir. - Thank you. Mark, the consignment should be here shortly. Yes. Hold on a second. I'll call you back. Mom. - Did you eat your food, Siddu? Yes, mom. I ate food in the flight. Okay. Put the driver on line. Mom, he very well know how much you care for me. When I ask him to drive the car speedily.. ..he refuses to go above 60 speed. Okay. Go home and rest. Never mind, I will come straight to the program, mom. Okay, son. - Okay, mom. Friends, greetings to everyone from Annapoorneshwari Group of Companies. Now, I request Ms. Annapoorneshwari Shivkumar... ..the managing director of the company.. ..to come here and speak a few words. Greetings. Sit down. - Okay. Please come. Greetings. You must be wondering why I have summoned all of you here. Generally, such things should be discussed in the office.. ..or in the presence of a lawyer or an auditor.. ..but I will be glad only if I do this thing at your presence. As all of you that my son Siddu, Siddharth.. ..had been to America for education. He has come back completing his studies. Now, I am giving the responsibility of looking after you.. ..and Annapoorneshwari Group of Companies to my son. Come, Siddu. Greetings, sir. Marappa, I heard that the program was quite grand. - Yes. Someone said the garment business is doing well. Yes, sir. Your younger brother's wife.. ..has handed her responsibility that she has been fulfilling for years to her son. Moreover, the company is giving 16 percent bonus to the employees. What for? Because the company has made good profit this year. That's why... - She should be beaten with slipper. If the company suffered loss in the coming year, who will bear it? Ask her if she realises that. The workers are paid for their work. Don't we elders mean anything to her? - Please come inside. Leave me. - Go away. She might've toiled hard.. ..but it was my brother who started the factory. - Okay, come. Ask her if she is out of her mind? If she gives bonus to her employees.. ..even my employees will demand for bonus too. Sleep for a while. Darn it. - I am married to you for years.. ..I know how to calm you down. Do it again. Marappa. - Yes. Who has stopped the vehicle in the middle of the road? - I don't know, sir. Who are you? Move! Move inside! - Let go! Take the phone. I want 10 crores in 10 minutes. Call anyone you want. Take it. Is he mad? He is talking rubbish. After denominations of 500 and 1000 was banned the Prime Minister went on a rally. What do I do? So I always deposit Rs. 10 in the bank. Even that was banned. I don't want to know your past. Don't think only you have been kidnapped.. ..I have sent my boys to your house.. ..listen to this. Some goons have come home. If you give 10 crores, I will spare your wife alive. Otherwise... Here, tell her. - Dear, where are you? Dear, where are you? - I beg to you. Please don't do this. Please... Kill her. Which husband would give 10 crores to save his wife? It's a wonderful plan, please kill her. Don't take me for granted. I will kill her for real. Please kill her. She carries insurance of 15 crores. If you kill her, I will get all that money. I will pay you a commission of Rs. 6000. How about Rs. 10,000? We wasted our time. Boss, what if he goes to the police? What is the person who tries to catch fish in the urine called? He is called a miser. He is even worse. He looks for pearls in the urine. He won't go to the police. Let's go. - Okay, boss. - We wasted our time. Sir. What are you looking for? I dropped my money here. Here it is. Ma'am. - Yes. How are you? - I am fine. Do you remember her? - Of course, yes. She's Ms. Meenakshi. Very good. You still remember me. - Yes, I do. Come. These are new machines. Come. Mom, total number of... Lalita. - Yes, ma'am. Your child is crying, go and check. - Okay, ma'am. Lalita. - Yes, ma'am. We work hard for our children, right? - Yes. So, if the mother is working when the child is crying.. ..it is wrong. Go and console your child. Go. - Okay. What happened? Why are you crying? Siddu. Come here. It's been six months. I don't see any sign of recovery in your mother. Don't mind me, Siddu. It is futile to continue her treatment here. I suggest you take her home. Let she stay in her house during her ending days. Think about it. Boy! Get up! Come here! Don't sit there. Come here. Listen to me. You want your mother. Yes. What have you done so far to get your mother cured? I got her treated in all the hospital across the world. You have only spent the money earned by your mother. What have you done? Did you spend your money? I have nothing to spend. What if you have? - I will surely give it away. Will you give away anything? Yes, I will. You must leave behind your wealth, money and honour.. ..and live like a common man. For your mother who gave birth to you.. ..you will have to live leaving your identity behind. You grew up without knowing what hunger is! You must beg for even one meal. You must beg for alms. You must live like a beggar for a period of 48 days. For those 48 days.. ..nobody should know of your identity.. ..and the reason for you to beg. Can you live like a beggar for your mother? If I do it, will my mother get cure? 'If I do it.' You didn't even utter the word beg. Then how will you live like a beggar for 48 days? It's not the question of what you will attain. The question is what you will offer to attain it. The law of nature is evident. Give and take. You will get only if you give. Many mothers make vows, offer prayers, fast.. ..to beget children, to make her child speak.. ..so that her grown up children get married soon. They eat food on the floor.. ..beg for money on the streets and offer it to God.. ..but those mothers don't ask question like you do. Because her children are not just children for her.. ..but children are a part of them. If you also love your mother.. ..you will do what I said. Remember. Under any circumstances nobody must know who you are for those 48 days. You will beg for alms, spend some money from it.. ..and offer the remaining money to God every day. You must start your day with empty hands again. Will you do it? I need to think. Siddu. Siddu. Siddu. Mother! - Siddu! Siddu! - Yes, mother! Mother! I can't. Please help me to sit, son. - Okay, mother. Water. - I will bring. Siddu! - Yes, mother! Will I die, son? No, mom. Nothing as such will happen. I wish to spend some more time with you, son. Will you save me, Siddu? Mother? 'You must live like a beggar for a period of 48 days.' 'Will you save me, Siddu?' 'The law of nature is evident.' 'Give and take.' 'You will get only when you give.' 'I wish to spend some more time with you, son.' 'Can you live like a beggar for your mother?' 'If you love your mother..' '..you will do what I say.' Siddu. - Yes. Your paternal uncle is here. Here's the production review for this month. Our both the factories have fallen to down to 6th place. I didn't say anything for all these days because your mother is in coma.. ..but I am here today because there's no other option. Think for yourself.. ..if you're running the business correctly. Sorry, uncle. I'm unable to concentrate on business.. ..because of mother's condition. Then sell them. Why do you want to ruin the business? If you sell it, you will be left with at least property. Okay, uncle. Let's sell both big and small factories. I... Rajesh, I won't be in town for the next 48 days. What? - Yes. Where are you going? Don't ask me. I will phone you if needed. I have kept the signing authority letters on my office table. Take care of everything. - I? How can I? It is... - Tell people I'm on foreign trip. Mother. Bye. Excuse me. You forgot your coat. Excuse me, sir. Why are you leaving your bag? Sir... I was going to the washroom. This is offence, take it. Sorry. Sir, Rs. 1,600. I have no change. Keep the change. Sir! Sir, give alms! Ma'am, give alms! Sir, give alms! Sir, give alms! Ma'am! Sir, give alms! Sir! Sir, give alms! 'Remember.' 'Under any circumstances nobody must know who you are for those 48 days.' I haven't eaten for two days, sir. Sir, give alms! - Sir! Sir! - Sir, give alms! You don't have to give only money. If you have food tokens, give it to us, we will go and eat in the hotel.. ..but give Rs. 50 for auto rickshaw fare please. He's opening his wallet. Sir! - Please, sir. Sir! Take it. Share it. 1, 2, 3, 4, there's Rs. 4500. Rs. 4500? - Yes. Is he crazy? I don't know if he is crazy or not, but we are lucky today. You're right. Look, someone is coming. Give it to me. - I won't give. Ma'am! Ma'am! Please give me alms. Ma'am! Please give me alms. Ma'am! Ma'am! I haven't eaten food for three days. Please give me alms. What? Nothing. Sorry. - Go away. Where do you want to go? Can I borrow the newspaper? Okay. Take it. 'You didn't even utter the word beg.' 'Then how will you live like a beggar for 48 days?' Sir. - Get going. I said get going. Sir, please give me alms. - Get going. Sorry, I was talking to someone else. That's not a problem. We can talk to our regular boys. That's right. - Have you informed them? - Yes. Sir, please give me alms. I haven't eaten food for three days. You look fit and fine. Instead of working hard, you beg for alms? Why are you staring at me? Get going. Sir... - I will beat you. Get going. Let go of him! - He's begging for alms. Sir, please give me alms. Did you call Rajesh? - Yes, sir. Sir, would you like to have something? - Nothing. Need to attend SIIMA meeting. Go and bring the valuation papers? Okay, sir. Sir, the file. Siddu loves Italian cuisine. He has won best chef award also. Seth. - Sir. Talk to Arul yourself. - Okay, sir. By the way.. ..I've been trying to call Siddu past couple of days.. ..why is his phone switched off? Sir, actually... I'm his paternal uncle. Shouldn't you tell me? Not like that, sir. - Has he gone to Malaysia again? Yes, sir. He has gone to Malaysia. - Okay, give me his number. Seth wants to talk to him. Only he can call us.. we can't call him. Don't you have his number? He should've at least given his number. - Sir, is Mr. Siddharth in there? Passport renewal has come. Passport? - Yes, sir. They try to fool me. Passport renewal has come. How did he go to Malaysia without passport? They're hiding something from me. Value of both factories together is 265 crores. Are just factories having that much value? - Yes. Sir. - Yes. I must say. Our property is more compared to theirs. Marappa. - Yes. Stop the car. - Okay, sir. Seth. - Sir. Get down. There's bus stop behind, go by bus. Get down here? - Yes. Okay, sir. Oh, my God. - What is it to you? I will kill you. To heck with you. It's true that our property is more compared to theirs.. ..but my wife has given births to two daughters. You idiot. I won't get any share from the property, because she has only one son. He is the sole heir for property worth 900 crores. You idiot. You're a miser. - Ma'am! Guru! - Yes. - I found 1.5 crores in my suitcase last night. 1.5 crores? - Yes. Does anyone talk about it in open? Where did so much money come from? What did you do with the money? The IT Department came to raid the money.. ..I ran and picked up the suitcase.. ..while a dog came and peed on my face.. ..I woke up and my dream broke. You idiot. Stop talking rubbish. Now, take your bowl.. ..and continue begging. - Okay. Ma'am! Hey! Here comes the rich man. Sir, what brings you here? I told you he is a madman. Did your parents beat you and ask you bring the money back? Look, once you give money to beggars you won't get it back. - Yes. No exchange, no refund. You won't get your money back. You got it? Give me Rs. 10 and get out. I am not here for my money. Then? I will beg.. ..with you. You will beg with us? - Yes. Why? - People who come here to beg.. ..will be suffering from some disease. Just like us, isn't it? After listening to this story.. ..there might come a situation where we might have to give our money to him. Let's be careful. - You're absolutely right. Hello, no flashback, join the duty. Take the appointment letter. Sit. - Sit down. Sir, why are you kneeling down? Sit down. Turn around. You look like the son of a rich man. You don't look like beggars. Even Mother Teresa won't get emotional seeing you. Give me the makeup kit. - Yes. Take it. What's this? Your cheeks look chubby. Don't get attacked to him. - Hey! Shut up. You look good now. Should I apply it every day? No, apply it only for a couple of days. Start singing and start begging. Usually, a hero looks ugly in his debut film.. ..but after he acts a couple of films.. ..the audience will be impressed with him. Will the hero become popular in the very first film? No. It's all in the mindset of the audience. Similarly, even people will accept you as a beggar. Don't worry. But you were born handsome. Thanks. Look, don't beg for alms.. ..and disturb the devotees when they are entering the temple. Let them first beg for alms from God.. ..and we will beg for alms when they step out of the temple. Try to understand the psychology. Like this. Like this. You didn't understand? - No. This is their way.. ..and this is our way. Now, try it. Ma'am! Hello. People won't give alms if you just look at them. Call out. - Ma'am! Not like that. Ma'am! Ma'am! - Ma'am! Ma'am! - Melody is very important. Your voice should make people emotional. Ma'am! Join with me! Ma'am! - Ma'am! Sir! Hello! Get out. Practice. Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! - More pain. Sir, please give me alms. - Ma'am! Sir! - Please give me alms. - Hello. Sir. Hello! Ma'am! - Sir, please give me alms. Sir! - Sir, please give me alms. - Hello. Ma'am! Sir! - Sir! - Hello! Sir, please give me alms. - Ma'am! Hello! Ma'am! - Ma'am! Sir! - Sir! Have you packed the items? - Take it, ma'am. Hello. Rajesh. - Siddu. Mother. - No improvement. She has high temperature past couple of days. Where are you, Siddu? Siddu! I am sorry. Hello, you don't know me. The owner of the phone has fallen unconscious. Your number was in received call list. I am near the wine store beside Udupi Clock Tower. Bindu, what are you doing? Mother, look at him. He's a father of a child. He has fallen unconscious. Poor child would be waiting for this book, right? 'You will beg for alms, spend some money from it..' '..and offer the remaining money to God every day.' Sir, please give me alms. You give me first. I am asking you. Sir, please give me alms. - If you give me, I will give you. I have nothing with me, sir. Don't lie. Your lips are beautiful. Sir... - What? Sorry, sir. - Siddu! There are foreigners in the auto rickshaw, let's beg for alms, come. Sir, please give me alms. Sania, Julia, please give me money. Hello. Please help me. Hello. - Please, ma'am. Take it. - Sir, please give me alms. Give me money. - Thanks for your kindness. Thank you. - Why do you ask for more money? I am not... Don't ask for her kidney, ask for something more. Girija! - Yes. I have brought dollars! - How much? 25 dollars. - It is foreign exchange? I have deducted commission. Count the money. Thank you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here's your share Rs. 300. Rs. 600 for me. - Take it. I want to buy a shirt. This one stinks. Welcome. This is our showroom. See my showroom. You asked for shirt, right? These are rejected shirts. What's the size? I would rather... - Sir. I... - Most of the money we earn is spend on food.. ..will you want to buy a land near a beach and build a resort? Just chill. The work we do... What do you think of our job? You think we beggars beg for alms all day long? Will the doctor inject the patient all the time? Try to understand. Like people go back home.. ..or liquor shop and are lost in their world after finishing the duty at 6.. ..even the beggars do the same. They have their personal life after 6. Take it. The shirt will surely fit you.. ..and if it doesn't, come and take whichever you want. Thank you. Come, sit down. - Never mind. I called you to iron, come and sit. If you sit on it and move your body, the shirt will get ironed. Don't wear this shirt tomorrow for duty.. ..people won't give alms. If you want alms, you should be blind.. ..or handicap. You should not have half hand like Mangalore Masterpiece. It's me only. See. - Okay. How much for the shirt? You're like my brother. I am so sorry. I was really trying to kill a fly.. ..but I accidently hit you. Take a look if you want to. It's okay. - I am extremely sorry. Never mind. Sir. - Yes. - Menu. Thank you. You didn't wash your hand yet. I will continue to kill flies after you leave, I will wash my hand at night. What? Nothing, sir. Run through the menu. I will wash my hand and come. - Okay. Excuse me. - Yes. One mini veg pizza. - Sure, sir. Girls, customer. Mom, we have a customer. Yes! Okay. I got to go. I had vowed to offer Rs. 100 to God if we had customer today. I will fulfill the vow and come. - Okay. Why did you become dull? What happened? He ordered only a small pizza worth Rs. 75.. ..but you offered Rs. 100 to God. Okay. We have at least one customer.. ..so let's be happy, okay? Come on, guys. Let's do this. Quick! What do we do? Our boss dropped us here and went away.. ..we have no money too. The director will be waiting for me. Are you doing a film, Manja? You're an idiot. - What? I said I am waiting for liquor. Hey! - Yes. - Look there. - What? Manja, if you have Rs. 1000.. ..how much will you offer to God? Even if I have 1 lakh rupees, I will offer only 1 rupee. He offered Rs. 500 to God.. ..so he must be a rich man. He must be having plenty of money in his wallet. Give me Rs. 1000. Rs. 1000? - Hey! Why do you get surprised? Did we demand for high amount? All right, we will give 10 percent discount.. ..give us Rs. 900. I just offered all the money to God. To God? - Yes. Will you offer all your money to God and beg for alms? Yes, sir. Are you kidding us? I will thrash you. Give me the money. Sir, I'm telling you truth. From what I get in begging.. ..deducting my expenses, I give away some money for charity.. ..and offer the remaining money to God. Some foreigners gave me some dollars yesterday.. ..and I... Are you cooking tales for me? Sir... - Snatch the money from him. Sir, I have no money. Please try to understand. - Are you my lover to understand you? Sir. Manja. - Yes. - He has no money.. ..he has a photograph of a beautiful woman. He must be a womanizer. Sir, please give it. Give it to me. Wow! She is stunning, isn't it? Seeing her with sari won't be fun. Imagine her in bikini or skirt. Hey! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Beware. Mom! Pick me up, I can't bear the pain. Come and pick me. Look at you. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Sir, just a minute. He's my friend. He slipped and fell inside the bin. Please help us, sir. Idiot! Who is idiot? - Your father. - Really? You mess with our boy and try to seek help from us. Pick him fast.. ..thrash truck will arrive any moment. - Let's go. Do you know who thrashed you? Who? - A beggar. A beggar! Oh, my God! He has thrashed me to pulp. Oh no. Oh, my God! You stupid fool, are you blind? - Sorry, sir. You applied break suddenly. - You idiot. Don't you know you should maintain gap? Sir, I will pay for the damages. How much will you pay me? How much will you pay me? What do you think? It is not a two wheeler to pay Rs. 500 or Rs. 1000 and settle the issue. It's Benz car. The charges for only servicing the car will be around Rs. 25,000. Will you pay that money? Answer me. Will you pay that money? You won't understand. It is the system that needs to be blamed.. ..for having common roads for royal people like me and poor people like you. Go and deliver pizzas, eat snacks.. ..with the tip money. Idiot. Excuse me. Does your car have insurance? - Yes. Then go claim for it. Don't underestimate because you're rich. You said you were from royal family. You think you're from a royal family because you own a Benz car? Do you know the rate of Benz, higher end model? 3 crores, 65 lakhs, plus GST.. ..and this car is only 70 lakhs. Do you think you're rich? PY, Pondicherry registration. Just to save 3 lakhs.. ..you get your car registered with fake ID.. ..and drive the car in our state without paying road tax.. ..and you say you belong to a royal family. You're insulting a girl saying you belong to a royal family. Did you purchase the car by paying cash or through finance? Come, show me your RC book. You're driving the car without turning on the air-condition. Do you want to save petrol? You're absolutely right, sir. Superb. What do you do, sir? 'Share it.' - He works in share market. He works in share market. He knows everything about cars. Why are you still here? Get going. Thank you. Do you remember you had come to our restaurant? - Yes. Can I have your number? - Sorry, I don't use phone. Take my number. We're colleagues. - Okay. 99456637. Please don't call while I am on duty. Okay. - Good girl. She believed what I said. Look, Manja. - I saw you. Pledge that you won't tell anyone that we got thrashed by a beggar. Look, there is no need for this. My family is good at maintaining secrets. Do you think I will expose you? Never. Look, don't trust him. He is like weather. I changes frequently. It will be a shame for us if our aide finds out that we got thrashed. People fear us because we're dangerous. If they find out that we got thrashed by a beggar.. ..the other goons will treat us like cowards. Make him pledge immediately. - Go on. I don't feel good here, let's go to another temple. To another temple? Some more. Pledge at least now. Stop pestering me. You got thrashed by a beggar.. ..I won't tell him, I mean.. ..I won't tell our aide.. ..or anybody. Okay? Pledge right away. - Correct. Get me more liquor.. ..of the same brand please. We have no money. Drink my beer if you want. What do you think of me? The tiger won't eat grass even if it is hungry. Similarly, I won't drink beer at any cost. Go and bring more liquor. Give me money. There's money over here. I will repay tomorrow. - I said I have no money. Take it. I love you. - Get away. Buddy! I got a call. Hello. - Sir, give me liquor of the same brand. Sena. - Sir. - Don't mind me if I say something. You're getting married next week, why do you fight? You got thrashed by a beggar.. ..and you celebrating. Get away. Really? Oh, my God! - Hey! Why are you beating him? Don't. Don't beat him! Let's go! Let go of him! - Leave me! Answer the phone first. You! How dare you? Yes, dear. - Where are you? - With my boss. Shame on you! You stole my money.. ..and partying in the liquor bar? You're celebrating for getting thrashed by a beggar. Come, I will teach you. Oh, my God! What happened? - You revealed our secret though you promised that you wouldn't. Beat him! Hey! Siddu! Hey! - Idiots! You come here every day to molest despite of knowing she's mentally retarded. Fortunately, you were present with us today. Come, my dear. Come! Don't be adamant! Come! Siddu, let's go to sleep. Come. Are you thanking me? I know how difficult it is to pretend before the world. I don't know you're from and why you are like this.. ..but you are not mad. I know you are pretending to be a mad girl. Did you sign? - Yes, I did. Give it to sir. - Sir. Sir. Where is the girl? - She is outside. They gave admission for free here. If you stay here, you will be safe. I will take you to another place after a few days. Be careful, she is coming. Are you with patient named Geeta? Yes. - Please come. Come. This is her bed. - Okay. You get one hour to meet the patient every Saturday. You can come and spend time with her, okay? - Okay. Yes! How is that girl related to you? Her father is a farmer. He used to do farming by taking loan. They shifted to Bangalore due to drought. After they shifted there.. ..he used to work as a watchman in an ATM. Her father lost his life when the ATM was being looted.. ..and she became an orphan. She is pretending to defend herself. I will take her to a better place in a few days. Why? - For doing such a good deed. In that case, you're great too. - Why? When people in the city are busy with their things.. ..a man was fallen down, ignoring that he was a drunkard.. ..you helped him, so you're great. After graduating from college, I received many job offers from MCs.. ..but I was not interested. My friend and I opened a pizza cafe.. ..but business is not happening as we expected. The dough gets spoilt in the freezer itself. So, we come to centers like this and give it away for free. Anyway, we're planning to shut down the business this month. Why? - There's no business at all. You saw us killing flies all the time. Hence, even rare customers like you get beaten up. Bindu. - Yes. Did you like her? She's good, mom. There are photographs of several girls. Take a look at all of them. - Mom. No, mom. I feel she is my girl. Siddu. - Yes. - Look here. Bindu. Since you wouldn't believe.. ..I had already written the name. I liked her too. Good choice. Drop the idea of shutting down your restaurant. I will come to your restaurant every evening. Can I run the restaurant just for the mini pizza that you order? Practically, it is difficult. I am not coming as a customer.. ..but as a chef. Come. Why did you delete the picture? There's a beggar at the background. What are you doing there? Come over here. Come. Now, let me see which beggar will come in between us. Stop! Go to sir. Stop! Oh no. I did not renewal the insurance. Wait, I will go and talk to him. I'll be back. Sir, the insurance... - Give Rs. 100 and go. Sir, I have no money. You don't have even Rs. 100? What do you do? I am beggar, sir. A beggar? Are you kidding me? No, sir. - Wait a minute. Constable, come here. Take the vehicle to the station. - Sir. Please believe me, sir. I am a beggar. I have taken alms from you several times. From me? - Yes, sir. Where? - You visit Lord Krishna temple every Sunday. You offer prayers with complete devotion. You look around, you do sit ups.. ..sit in a corner and weep. You then wipe your tears and leave the temple as if nothing happened.. ..and give alms only to female beggars. Like a hero, you... Stop it. I now believe you're a beggar. Who is that girl? She is my girlfriend. - What? Yes, sir. I am 45 years old.. ..but I didn't find a single girl. Moreover, I am a government employee. That's why I go to that temple.. ..and plead Lord Krishna to help me find a girl to marry. Is that the reason you give alms only to female beggars? Yes. If I manage to woo of them.. ..I will marry her. Just like she fell in love with you. Go. Sir, your hat. I shall leave, sir. - Get out of my sight. Go away. Okay, sir. How did you convince him? What did you tell him? I told him the truth. Come. The building beside the road.. ..survey no. 241.. ..it's a small factory. It is worth 48 crores. And survey no. 241A.. ..241B, both together, it is a big factory. 217 crores. Both the properties are for sale. I will buy both the properties from my brother's son.. ..but as a proxy. You must prepare the documents in Seth's name. Okay? - Okay, sir. I will sanction both loans from my bank immediately. You shouldn't do it immediately. Why, sir? Look, first sanction loan.. ..for the small factory beside the road. For the big factory, both the survey nos.. ..cite some reason and delay the documentation. If we purchase it, the access for this big factory will be locked. The surrounding is reserve forest land.. ..so helicopter would be needed.. ..to bring the goods inside. Just watch, I will get the money I demand for this land. As you please. I haven't received commission for the loan I sanctioned the last time. There's no difference between private sector and public sector.. ..everyone take bribe. This commission is for him. Don't try to siphon money from it. Go. Sir. - Yes. Why do you look dull? Marappa. You yourself gave the commission money of 4.5 lakhs. When my younger brother was ailing.. ..we couldn't afford his treatment. - Stop it, sir. He was then ready to sell this house and property only for 10 lakhs. She ruined my plot by slipping into coma. I lost the wealth and the properties. Sir, leave me. - Had this happen earlier.. I would've got his property, Marappa. My God. - I still have time. I will acquire the factories first and then the house. But we need Siddu to sign the papers. I don't know where he is. You don't know? - His friend said he works in share market.. ..but I don't think so. Mostly, he must be a master chef in another pizza shop. Correct. Seeing his beard, I think he is a poet or a painter, isn't it? What do you feel? My friends told me to ask what you do. Not me, my friends were asking so. Job is not the only thing that matters. Anything else? Okay, Siddu. I shall leave. If you are free, shall we meet at 6 o'clock? Okay. By the way.. ..what do you do? What did he say for that? If I answer this question I will have to answer a hundred more questions. For time being, don't ask me anything about it. I am not able to understand him. Why should you understand him? It is I who should understand him. Had he liked his job.. ..he would've told me about it. I think he is not happy with his job.. ..so, he must be doing a small job. He does some or the other work for survival. I am glad he is not a beggar. The person who delivers newspapers is called delivery boy, - Yes. The person who delivers milk is called milkman. - Yes. So the person who gives alms should be called beggar, isn't it? Why do people call us beggars? Is this enough? - It's a wonderful idea. You are still not ready? We're getting late. - I am not coming. You carry on. Look, you're a special man amongst all of us. You look charming even if you're begging for alms. So, walk decently.. ..and we will follow you. We are ready. Am I right? I believe you won't let me down. If not for my sake, at least for them. Look at him. he's so old. He won't live long. Won't you fulfill his last wish? Please. Let's go. We're getting late. There will be girls in the wedding.. ..I use this only when I am on duty. It's a secret. Are you related to the bride or the groom? Greetings. Welcome. - Greetings. Welcome, sir. How are you? - I am fine. When did you come back from abroad? How is your mother? I am glad. You have brought your friends along.. ..you must surely eat feast. The auspicious period is passing by, please come. Come. - Take them inside. There are empty seats, send the guests. You haven't served sweet to him, bring it. Take your time. Have you served them everything? Look here. Bring the snacks. Buddy, why are you thinking instead of eating? Do you want meat? I think I have him in my hometown. You haven't served potatoes fry to him. He is the owner of Manjunath Oil, isn't he? What? Him? - Serve him fritters. Does he look like the owner of an oil mill? You fool. He is a beggar too. He is from 2011 batch. He begs for alms at the temple near the bus stop. Is it him? Do you know the person standing there? Seeing his attitude, I think he's from the groom's family. Some of them are beggars. Is that so? - We didn't enquire before letting them inside. You're how many beggars? Beggars. How dare you sneak into a wedding and have feast? Get up. - Sir, they are eating food. Please be quiet for some time. Will you leave or should we drag you out? What? - Okay, sir. Please wait, sir. Get up. Get up all of you. Come. Come. Siddu, get up. Thieves. So many of you. How dare they? What did you say? - I said 'thieves'. Hey! - Hey! Beat him! - Stop it! Beat him! Sir, please leave him. Sir, please leave him. What they did is wrong. What you did is right. They have become beggars in this birth because of their bad deeds. They wished to sit with good people like you and eat food.. ..they shouldn't be thrashed, but put to gallows. You don't protest against the corrupt politicians.. ..but you thrashed those who came here to eat just one square.. ..you are good people. It is just one square meal for you.. ..but they think that they are fortunate to get even one square meal. He is an old man, but thrashed him as if he is your enemy. Remember one thing. You and I have a common and a permanent enemy. It is hunger. They came here to eat food because they were hungry. Please forgive them. Let's go. Sir, who are you? - Come. I am one of them. I am a beggar. Come. Sir, they picked up fight with me first.. ..and they have kidnapped me today. I am innocent. Ask them yourself. Okay. I will ask them. Why did you kidnap him? It was I who ordered them.. ..to thrash you.. ..and bring you here. Me too. I wanted to know who sent them.. ..that's why I got thrashed by them and came here. I won't thrash them.. ..I will thrash only you. He said he will thrash me in front of you. Let's see. Let's see who will thrash whom. Move back. No one should intervene, beware. Oh, my God. Our boss is getting thrashed. Let's flee. Beware! Boss! - Boss! Are you out of your mind? Our men got thrashed by a beggar.. ..and you are laughing at them. Let it be, boss. My stomach is aching. I am not able to control my laugh. Shall I laugh once, boss? Please. Please, boss. Okay, boss. Please, boss. Hey! Is it funny to you? 'He does some or the other work for survival.' 'I am glad he is not a beggar.' Ma'am, give me food. Don't you have festival offers. - Sir, curry free on 'Idli'. You're very smart. The food was tasty. Having food stomach full makes us content. Siddu, someone is missing you. Be quiet. If that's true then Sunny Leone would die of hiccups. I miss her too. Actually... Siddu, look there. Didn't I tell you? Why are you getting hiccups? No one misses you. Let's go. I will find a girl too. Bindu. - Yes. Bindu. Ma'am, give him alms else he won't leave. He won't go. Hey! Stop looking at me. You should convince me when I am angry.. ..but you just don't care. Darn it. Look at the clothes you are wearing. Look, listen to me. Come with me.. ..work in our restaurant. Handle the cash department. If you don't like it, I will get you another job.. ..but stop begging, please. Sorry. I can't do that. - Why? Won't you tell me? 'Under any circumstances nobody must know who you are for those 48 days.' I can't tell you. Oh, I am still not close to you, isn't it? I am a fool. Without trying to know who you are, I fell in love... I mean you're my good friend. Look, don't tell anything about me. We're not school or college mates.. ..nor you're my maternal cousin to tell me your secret. Bye. 'I can't tell you.' You're CBI officer, right? Are you on a secret assignment? - Well... You said you're a beggar, pick that up.. ..and get lost. Hey. - Yes. We can make good money on the festival day in Dharmastala. Get ready. We will stay in Dharmastale for one week. Shall I book air conditioned berths for all of them? 'Usually, large number of devotees.. ..visit Chamundi Hills during festival times or during holidays.. ..but today is not festival nor holiday.. ..but hundreds of female devotees have paid visit to Chamundi Hills.' 'Do you know the reason?' 'Our correspondent Sunaina from Chamundi Hills.' 'The owner of the company where these women work is ill past several days.' 'Therefore, they have come to offer prayers for her. Interesting, isn't it?' 'Come, let's talk to them.' 'Do you have so much respect towards Ms. Annapoorneshwari?' 'She is observing silence. - Then you speak.' 'It is said that God examines good people, it is true.' 'Our madam is getting my younger brother educated..' '..in the college where her son studied in abroad.' 'Is that so?' 'Not only her brother's education..' '..she finds out the problem of every employee working..' '..in her company and helps them.' 'Ma'am, you climbed the hills for your madam's speedy recovery...' 'She's not my boss.' 'She is like my daughter.' 'I will not only climb his hill for my daughter's recovery..' '..I am ready to even lay down my life.' 'Why only women have come?' 'Don't men work in your company?' 'Our boss's son is not in town..' '..and the male employees have to look after the company until he is back..' '..therefore, no male employee can take leave.' 'You saw for yourself, viewers.' 'For those who think factory is all about business..' '..the bonding between the owner and the employees is an example to them.' Hello. - Hello. Rajesh. - Siddu. I saw our workers on television. I was about to sell the factory in which they work. We must do something for them. That's a good thought. What should we do? Seth, what did you pray to God? Did you pray for fast registration of the factory.. ..or for your wife who fled? Not both, sir. I prayed to God that.. ..there should be no shortage in the commission money that you pay me. Your phone is ringing. Hello. Seth, my younger brother's son is begging. I am telling you something serious.. ..and you look sullen? Who called? Factory manager Rajesh called. - What did he say? Siddu has instructed not to sell both the factories. Not to sell them? - Yes. He is begging for alms here. Marappa, keep this in the car. Okay, sir. - Marappa, come here. Yes, sir. - I have counted the fruits. Okay. - Three apples, three oranges.. ..two pomegranates, 17 bananas.. ..and one garland. Even if one fruit goes missing, I won't spare you. Go. Okay, sir. Seth. - Yes. Follow me. I saw him right here. - Where? You search there I will search here. - Okay. Ma'am! Please give me alms. Did you find him? - No, sir. He is not to be seen anywhere. Are you sure you saw him or are you mistaken? If you say that, I will order Marappa to ram the car into you. Do you think I am mad? Let's go. - All right. - Shut up. Why would a billionaire beg for alms? There can be two reasons. He must've made a vow or he must be mad. It must be a vow. He must be begging for his mother recovery. There will be number of days to fulfill the vow, right? Well... - Some follow it for 48 days.. ..some follow it for 108 days. It depends on the kind of vow people make. Why? Do you want to make a vow, sir? It's him. There's a girl with him.. ..I want both of them. What is the matter? Wrong things happen in that hospital. Since mentally retarded patients don't understand anything.. ..they conduct tests on them. Doctors from abroad visit the hospital. They talk about their wrong doings thinking.. ..I am mad and I wouldn't understand anything. New medicines invented by the foreigners.. ..are tested on the patients there if it works properly or not. Overdose is given on me too. The patients develop new disease everyday.. ..and die a terrible death. Catch her! 50 lakhs advance. I will pay the rest of the money after you finish them. Didn't they find anybody else? I will give you double the money.. ..after you finish him. He didn't spend a single penny to save his wife. But now, he has even paid advance money. Who is he? The doctor and that miser paid money on the same day to finish him. Have you seen him? Boss, it was he who caused this injury on his face. What? - Yes. Is he a hooligan? Where does he hail from? Is he from this city or from Mumbai or from Bihar? No, boss. Then? - He is a beggar. What? A beggar? Ritu, a beggar has thrashed our men.. ..and you did nothing. You should've killed him. Boss. - Yes. He thrashed him more. Why do I call you 'Right'? Answer me. You answer me. Because we report to him during your absence. Correct. Hereafter, call him 'Left'. Come on. - Left. Yes. - Left. Left! Do you know why I named you Left? You don't fit for hooliganism. Akshara. - Okay, I will bake later. - I have kept it here. Akshara, one veggie, one fry, with cheese. - Okay. Look, if you can't forget him.. ..even you beg for alms sitting on a platform. I am getting angry. I am getting very angry.. ..but I don't understand if I am angry on him or myself. I am not able to forget him. Along with anger, I also feel like crying. Come. Our boss has given Biryani, take it. Enjoy yourselves. They have brought food, come fast. The one talking to the crippled, it's him. It's very tasty. It's him? '50 lakhs advance.' 'I will pay you double the money after you finish him.' Boss, we should've finished him by now. Siddu... How dare you beat my men? A beggar. No chance. There is no way.. ..that a beggar could.. ..thrash goons so badly. Tell me. Who are you? Where do you hail from? Tell me. Tell me. 'Under any circumstances nobody must know who you are for those 48 days.' Tell me, I will let you go. Tell me as you are alive. Come on, tell me. Tell me. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? How dare you thrash my men? Left, after he gets up, thrash him.. ..and ask him where that mad girl is.. ..let's deal with the rest later. Why are you looking at me like that? Do you want to get thrashed again? Tie him up. They will be looking for me. If I am with you, you will be in danger too. I will stay alone for a few days.. ..I myself will contact you. Geeta, do you remember what I said? - Yes. Take her to the news channel. I will come, okay? - Buddy. - Yes. Here, take this phone. - Thanks. Bye. Ma'am, I am a blind man who doesn't have eyesight. Those who don't have eyesight are called blind people only. People, please give me alms. I am unemployed. I am unemployed. Ma'am! - Sir! Nobody is responding. I think people have no money after demonetization. Sir, have you seen him anywhere? No. - Move back. Have you seen him? - Yes. Where? - In the photograph. Sir! - Ma'am! I am a beggar who is blind. Please give me alms. Please give me alms. You pretend to be a blind man. If people find out, they will thrash us. Get up. Get up. - Get up. Get up. Get lost. - Get up. Get lost. - Get lost. Get lost. - Sit quietly. He's gone. Okay. Ma'am! - Ma'am! Who are you? Why are you seeing us and then the photograph? Who are you? I am a beggar too. Look. Ma'am! I beg just like you. - How much money did you make since morning? Sir, this place is unlucky.. ..that's why nobody give alms to me. Nobody is giving us alms because of you. I smell something. What's in the bag? Show me. - Sir, nothing. Have you come here for nuptial night? You beg for alms spraying scent? I will... - Catch him! Stop! We also became beggars like him the moment he thrashed us. My wife went to her maternal house leaving me because I got threshed by a beggar.. ..now, if she finds out that I have become a beggar.. ..she will divorce me. My body is itching. Listen to my problem. When I asked the beggar for this shirt and pant.. ..he showed no mercy towards me. Why? - He took Rs. 1080 for this. Rs. 1080? I was shocked too, and when I asked him the same, do you know what he said? What did he say? - Rs. 1000 for the clothes and Rs. 80 as GST. The smell is unbearable. Take it off. - What? The clothes. - I will do it at once. Take it off. Sir, please give me alms. We're already annoyed, don't annoy us more. You're begging for alms by tying the cloth to your left hand today.. ..yesterday, you were begging for alms by tying the cloth to your right hand. We know you beggars are fraud. Get going. - Do you think you're policeman? Yesterday, he was sitting on the cart and he was pushing it.. ..today, I am sitting on the cart and he is pushing it. You couldn't know even that and you try to act smart with us. Get going. - Get going. Push me. Give way. - Get lost. Coffee. Take it. I am not enjoying the rain today, mom. What are you saying? I am quite shocked. Why? Any problem? Can I go out alone for a while? Raincoat. Bindu. Won't you accept even this? Why? I can't accept it. Siddu. Will you accept it if I give it as alms? 'Rajesh, I won't be in town for the next 48 days.' 'Look after everything until I am back.' Bindu, I have a doubt. Do you take selfie after you both become close.. ..or become close after taking selfie. I think I have seen him somewhere. Wait a minute. What is his name? - Siddu. Siddu. His full name is Siddharth Shivkumar. He is the only son of the owner of.. ..Annapoorneshwari Group of Companies, Bangalore. He completed MBA abroad. Since his matrimonial profile said 'money is not important..' ..I had sent your photograph to him 7-8 months ago. I don't know what happened after that. He didn't reply. That's why I didn't tell him. Three goons came.. ..enquired about you.. ..I said 'I don't know'.. ..so they thrashed me. We had gathered money to commence a small business they took the money too. Buddy, the hero of the English film... He is out of his mind. Was it them? - Yes. How dare you loot poor people? Give back the money. Come on. Come on. Take it. God bless you. Please leave. We won't spare you. Get up. Come this way. Get him. Rajesh. Mother? Mother... She is battling for her life. She can die... Siddu, come with me. What are you thinking? This is not the time to think. Come with me. Oh. Did the sage manipulate so much? I know everything. I came here after meeting the sage. If begging for alms could cure all the diseases.. ..in the medical colleges across the world.. ..students would've stopped practicing medicine.. ..and practiced begging. If you stay like this.. ..will your mother recover? I don't know, Rajesh. Many people think they can buy everything with money.. ..but God.. ..made me realise things very soon. One can buy mattress with money.. ..but not sleep. Only after the doctors gave up hope.. ..I took this decision. I have money.. ..but I am not able to save my mother. I wish my faith will save my mother, Rajesh. If I don't do this.. ..I will feel guilty all my life. Fool! Your foolishness is very evident. You have been going through tough times.. ..so your mother should've recovered at least to an extent. Why didn't it happen? Her condition has become critical. Try to understand. You should be with her at times like this. Come, let's go. Faith is only when you believe completely. I won't come until I fulfill the vow. Please don't force. Okay. But let me tell you something. You will regret all your life for.. ..not staying with your mother during her last days. Then the same sage will tell you.. '..amongst all the problems in this world, death is just a small thing..' '..I made you beg for alms just to make you understand that.' You will then realise.. ..that it was you.. ..who missed your mother. Rajesh, just for one night. The vow will be fulfilled tomorrow at 11 a.m... ..come and take me. I heard you and your friend talk. You're begging for alms to save your mother.. ..and your vow will be over tomorrow, I heard everything. That's why I am sending you this voice message. The vow will be fulfilled tomorrow. I will stay with you the entire day. Okay, Mr. Siddharth Shivkumar? I told you he's not a beggar. He is the MD of Annapoorneshwari Group of Companies. He is a billionaire. He used to thrash my men when he was a beggar.. ..so will he spare us after he becomes a billionaire again? He will finish us. You don't be scared, sir. There's still 12 hours for him to become a billionaire.. ..but he will die as a beggar. Ritu. What we have to do now is... ..If both don't get caught by the goons today.. ..we will land into legal trouble. - Yes. Inspector Purushotam will be inside.. ..I have spoken to him over the phone. Go inside and give the money, mention my name. That's enough. - Okay, sir. Look, you have his photograph, right? Yes, sir. - The inspector doesn't know that he is a billionaire. Even you don't tell him. - I know, sir. After all, they are police. What are you doing? - Please give me alms. What are you doing? - I am begging for alms. I will be with you the entire day. Come. Ma'am! Ma'am, please give alms. To you? - No, to him. - No, sorry. Sir, please give me alms. Who are they? - They had thrashed me for begging for alms. Who are you? - We're lovers. He is my boyfriend. Can I take a selfie? Rs. 100. - Rs. 100? Yes. Don't you want 'Like' and Comment' on Facebook? Rs. 50. - Okay. - Okay. I am at the bus station. - Sir, please give me alms. Greetings, sir. Sir, the note is old, give us a new note. Be quiet. Sir, that's all right. We will take it. - But... - Come. Ma'am, give me alms. Don't eat it. - Why? They will be stale at times. Did you eat stale food? Many times. When you are hungry, one can't help it. Give it to me, I will taste it and let you know. Give it. No, I will do it this time. Wow! It tastes better than the pizza in our restaurant. Come. Sir, please give me alms. Take it. The vow will get fulfilled in some time now. This is the last day of your begging.. ..and then you and I... How did you find out? I had sent you a voice message. Voice message? When? - When you and your friend were talking last night... Come, finish him. Come, stab him. You have a chance to become my close aide, come. First, you prove that you're a man. You named me Left because I lost the fight against him.. ..but instead of beating him though you came with your men.. ..you spiked his food and made him weak.. ..are you a man? Do you know what happened when you asked me to tie him up? I pretended to tie him up. If you have the guts, fight him alone. Left! - Get lost! Siddu! Siddu, listen to me! Siddu! Siddu! Stop it, Siddu! Enough. He will pay a price for his deeds. Come. Take this. Siddu! Hey! Bindu! Bindu! Doctor! Doctor look, she's bleeding profusely! Look, someone has slit her throat with knife. You must've picked up fight with someone. This is a police case. And what if someone comes to the hospital and creates ruckus? Bhuvana, send them away. - Okay, sir. Sir! - Doctor! Just a minute, doctor. I have been visiting various hospitals past 18 months.. ..I know the management of the hospital very well. I also know that if I don't deposit money.. ..you won't start the treatment. You must be wondering as to.. ..how I will be able to pay the bills seeing me in this attire, isn't it? Give me the account details of your hospital, doctor. I will deposit any sum of money within half-an-hour. Please, doctor. Please treat her, doctor. You say you will deposit any sum of money? Yes, I will. Who are you? Tell me, sir. Who are you? At least tell me what you do. Tell me, sir. I am a beggar, sir. I am a beggar. I am a beggar. Oh, will you get any sum of money in alms if you beg in English? Go away. - Doctor! Oh no! Sir, come fast! Bindu! Bindu! Mom, please forgive me. Hello. Who is it? Siddu! Hello? Sir, here are the belongings of the patient, check the purse. He is here. Get up. Inspector is calling you, come. What did I do? - Sir will tell you listen to him. Come. - Sir. Okay? - Sir. It's him. - Get into the vehicle. Sir, what did I do? Should I tell the reason to beggars? Hey! You beggar! How dare you hold my hand? No, sir. I wanted to know the time, sir. Sir, I have to spend some money that I beg.. ..and offer the rest of the money to God within 11 a.m. Please, sir. - After you offer the money to God.. ..will you come with me to the station. Sir. - Go. Pick it up. Siddu! Come. Offer the money as you said. Come on. Inspector, take your hand off. Do you know who he is? Guards, escort him. Siddu, go on. Sir, who are you? Sir, all the procedures have been fulfilled. She is out of danger. Thank you. Siddu, I have told everything to our HR department. They will take care. - Sir... I didn't know who you were. Please forgive me, sir. Please, sir. I was a beggar for all these days.. ..but I never felt ashamed. But today, I feel ashamed of being a rich man. You're apologizing to me because I am rich man. Value human being not money. Breaking news. Scam in mental asylum at Karavali. The police has arrested Ram Naik, the chief of this region. It is like a relief to the residents. In the other part of the state.. ..the police has arrested rowdy sheeter Arun Kale in the same case. Kale received money from two persons to kill a renowned businessman. The police say that they will arrest the second accused very soon. Marappa, the police is coming, go fast. Don't you understand? Go fast. Marappa. Sir. - Why did you stop the vehicle? Putappa! How dare you beat me? What's the matter with you? Just to repay the money that I had borrowed from you for my daughter's wedding.. ..I tolerated you despite of getting beaten up by you. I have repaid the money to you last week.. ..now, I am going to thrash you. You idiot! I won't spare you! Sir, wear the glasses. Take it, sir. Wear it. Sir. Please get down. Are you Putappa? Sir. This fellow hit me. Siddu! God let us down. I think she is waiting for you to fulfill the ritual with the holy water. Go. - Go. Mom! You needn't become normal like before.. ..you don't have to do anything. Just stay with me, mom. Who do I have other than you, mom? Though I lost faith in other things.. ..I didn't lose faith in you. Don't betray be by parting from me. I am standing as a beggar in front of you. Your son is begging to you. I beg to you to stay with me for few more days, mom. Mom! Mom! Please have mercy up on me. This is a true story of a boy who vowed to beg for six months to save his mother. The film 'Amma, I love you' was inspired by this story. Thank you very much for coming and watching this movie. Sir, please give me that roll. You still behalf like a beggar. Take it. - Hello. Old habits die hard, you know. Sir, fix that thing. - You won't reform. Ma'am, sir asked me to give you juice. Bindu, hold her for a minute. Mom, I will be back in a minute. Hello. Hi, Stephen. Sir, please give me alms. Please give me alms. Sir. Ma'am. - Come here. Don't worry about it, I have spoken to the officer. God bless you. - I will call you back later. Siddu. - Mom. - Come here. Yes, mom. - Did you notice that beggar? No, mom, I was on an important call. We might be very busy.. ..do the offering if you can afford.. ..if you can't, send him away. We must not make someone wait unnecessarily. The life of a beggar is miserable. Nobody should go through that situation. We won't be able to live as a beggar even for one single day. Sorry, mom. Let's move.
