I asked neil, "how did you figure out how to say that?" And he says, "well, i was thinking about the game we used to play as kids called mother, may i. You would say, 'take five small steps' to reach a certain goal, or you could say, 'take three giant steps.'" and he said, "on the way to the moon, i got to thinking about giant steps and small steps and i kind of put them together."

That was their boots burning because the lava under them was still hot. Worden: we went up to where it was flowing. Suddenly, there was a small eruption. The liquid started to bubble up more and more. We got out of there just in the nick of time. We were very lucky, i think, we didn't get trapped with the lava flows there. Narrator: despite the hazards... the astronauts soon pick up the knowledge needed to practice geology on the lunar surface.

Anders: they gave us a bag of water and a shovel and a parachute. Collins: you've got acres of nylon material, and from that material, you can build tents and clothing to protect yourself from the blazing sunlight. Anders: we had to make arab-type dress. One thing i did learn is, if you were in the desert, the idea is to conserve your sweat. Narrator: parachutes can even help quench your thirst.

Anders: mike collins and i were teamed up for jungle survival school. But we were trained in all the good things there were to eat. You could chop the vine and get water. You could pick fruit.
