"CUTLETS" a film by Bertrand Blier based on his play Did you hear someone knocking? Where? On the door! Why would anyone knock? Shh! I hear someone knocking! Why are you knocking? Did you hit your head? I didn't want to disturb you. You disturb me a lot, banging like that! It's frightful! Would you prefer it if I hit my head instead? Yes I would! At the very least! Who was it? It was no one. An old man. - You know him? - Never seen him. What does he want?? Eat! It's getting cold. You're right. He pisses me off, this guy! What do you want, knocking like that? You want me to hit you? Shit, is it a crime to knock on a door? You flap your gums, I knock on the door! Does the door pain you? Will a little hospitality kill you? I haven't robbed you. - Then what do you want? - I came to put you out. - What did you say? - I came to put you out! Chiguer! Don't you understand French? Why do you want to put me out? For the hell of it, my friend, for the hell of it. Don't start to "disser". I was standing on the stairs. I looked under all the doors. I got an urge to knock on some door, and I chose yours. - What kind of soup is that? - Leeks and potatoes. Will you offer me some? I made only enough soup for three, not four. When I make soup, I make it to four. And yet I live alone. All alone with my soup! No one drops in! A little patience. Someone will come. Who's that? The undertaker. He will be happy finish your soup. Are you happy with your wife? - What? - I asked if you're happy with your wife. What wife? That one! Sitting at your table! That's not my wife, that's my mistress. - Your mistress makes soup? - She made it for the child! - Is the child happy? - Leave my son alone! And what age are you, young man? I am at a difficult age. - Do you like football? - No, absolutely not. - Boxing? - No, not at all. - Car racing? - Even less. - He'll be a homosexual. - No, stop it, I forbid you! - Why do you forbid it? - On behalf of my son! - I'm a man who drops in! - Then come with me! Get out! I throwing you out! And don't come back! I will be back to put you out! How is it possible you don't like boxing? I don't like violent games. Isn't there anything that you love? I love a lot of things. What, for example? Fashion. I love fashion. But they're all queers, designers! So what if he's a fag? He'll still be your son. Why did you call my son a fag? I never said he was a fag, I said he's homosexual. There's a difference. I don't see any difference! "Fag" is contemptuous. "Homosexual" comes from the Latin for "man". Excuse my wording. It means "man". But that word doesn't mean "man". It comes from the Greek for "same". They're similar. - So you're attracted to "the same"? - I'm attracted to gentleness. You have something against gentleness? The curve of the shoulder, for example. Are you attracted to the shoulder of men or women? Just the shoulder. He hesitates. - Why has God sent me such a son? - Probably the mother... Don't bug me about the mother! Say whatever you want, but leave his mother alone! - Daddy! - My darling, don't worry, Daddy is here. I would like everything to be like before. Would you like to come with me? Where's that? To the bedroom. In one moment... You'll see. You'll learn. Come, my little rake. You are invited to a feast. Here we go! He doesn't have much appetite! He has to get used to it! Oh yes, the eyes in such cases are located on the fingers. In hetero cases, at least. My son is a hetero! Then he's a very passive hetero. - You are a very annoying guy! - But I warned you! - You live around here? - Who, me? Not at all. I live on the other end of Paris. Then what have you got to do with me? That is the question I ask myself. I also ask myself some questions. Do you find the answers? Just ask yourself the question: "Haven't I already answered?" Exactly. Exactly. Good question. Good response of the mind that not quite dead. You know how you can distinguish rogue right-wing from the left? No. When you shit, you must do it properly and carefully. Very often on the edges of the bowl remains a lot of crap. - Stuck, you know? - Yes. And when this shit remains, what must a leftist do? Scour. He takes up the brush, and the shit disappears! But what does the right do? He leaves the shit as it is! He doesn't even think. He has people he pays go everywhere behind him with a brush. Usually, it's a poor girl, once called a "maid" but now a "housekeeper" but always there is shit, and always she must clean it up This has never changed. Obviously women's work, obviously for foreigners, And obviously they have no right to complain. But only the right to love. But these hands, made for love, No one looks at them. These hands, made red from work, like others could please. And I'm talking only about hands, I refer to nothing else. The body, disrupted by pregnancies, beautiful breasts that are neglected, This ruined beauty, these bad mouths, all murdered. Even their eyes beg for mercy. That's the difference between right and left. And just this business of toilets, cleaned or not cleaned? Is that why you send the alarm? You send the alarm for toilets? I haven't cleaned off my shit. I've let it rest as it is. For how long? I can't remember anymore! It makes a horrible disquiet! What do you have for a water flush? I have what is proper. The colonnade model? This has got nothing to do with the colonnade model! How has it got nothing to do with the colonnade model? Excuse me, I've got another problem! What problem? I've left my wife. I've made myself suffer through too much naivete. I got the first apartment I could find and did not have time to properly investigate the toilets! - I have the "Standard" model from 1978! - And are you satisfied? I use a brush, I am a dissident of the right! - All my life I've been a leftist! - So? I am for the left! But perhaps you shit from the right! In the evening, when you return home, is your toilet clean? Yes it is. Till it glitters. And who cleans it? It's revolting to ask this question! That's why I ask it. And you're going to answer. Let's talk a little about your housekeeper. I have no desire to talk about my housekeeper. Oh no. On the contrary. You want to! Very much so. I'm listening. Her name is Nacifa. - She is from Algeria. - How old is she? She looks 40, but really she's 28. And me? How old do I look? I don't give a damn about your age! - Leave me my dream! - What dream? The dream of having a young woman, of course! - I have dreams too! - What dreams? Dreams of not being old and impotent? I'm neither old nor impotent! I'm still capable of love! - Physically? - Physically. - So how old are you? - 70. - And still with hair? - And still with hair. And what is it, when you're 70, that you still have hair? By looking at other people with less sympathy. For myself I love the plain! When there's not a single tree. - Aren't you tired yet? - Tired of what? - Of following me! - Old piece of shit. You seem to be gasping for breath. I'm not gasping for breath. How am I gasping for breath? - You are an alcoholic? - Obviously, I'm an alcoholic! - You are in suspense? - Obviously, I'm in suspense! - You feel lethargy? - Obviously, I feel listless. Then you need a drink. - You are a lost man. - All men are lost. If it weren't for women, we'd all be howling in the woods like wolves. Don't speak of the woods, I'd be very obliged. Forests! Woods! Hammer! Nails! Pillow! Old leak! The house on the island of Fe, perhaps? Or Lub?ron's? - Do you ever shut up? - I am poor and I am of the right. - And I'm proud to be poor! - You're proud of being stupid, too! And you're proud of what? I've just left my wife. That is, 6 months ago, I left her. - That should surprise me? - You said that you would listen! I'm listening. If this shouldn't surprise me, then I would be aware of it. I would then have all the appropriate responses ready. Incredulity, numbness, and so on, all that is expected. In short, all that is expected of friendship. And finally I must tell you: Friendship, what good does it do? I ask you to listen to me, and after I tell you, then you can say what you think. Yes, but I must remind you that I came to piss you off. That's all too clear. And that every time I interrupt, it's to get rid of this bullshit that fills your house! You can stop me whenever you want! I'm listening. My wife was forever growing thinner, but now I live with a girl who's very shapely. That's happiness! Just to put my hands on her. Such happiness. She's 30 years old, I'm 64. Such happiness. Every day like spring. In love, of course! This is called love. Something that happens to everyone. And then it's gone. You see, you'll be surprised. I was here all alone, I told my office not to bother me. I turned off the phone, I turned off the fax, to be in absolute peace. I needed to work on a major contract. Suddenly, in the hallway, going to the kitchen to get a coffee. Guess who I bumped into? Nacifa. Who was walking towards me. She looked away and pressed to the wall, so I could pass on. I didn't know what came over me, but instead of continuing to the kitchen, I turned and looked in her face. Her face. She lowered her eyes. She always lowers her eyes, when we meet in my apartment. I looked at her. I looked at her skin. I could hear her heart beating. Then what? It was necessary that this woman raises her head again, I tell myself, that she regain her dignity, because she was loved by a man. A man who's overwhelmed by her! Who would give her all the things she doesn't have! Things she'd never thought of. What things? Tranquility. Rest. Time flowing slowly past. The ability to be herself, and the ability to please herself. To finally know the pleasures of being lazy, of being capricious, of doing silly things! To enjoy the pleasure and luxury of saying "No". In her life did she ever have the opportunity of saying no? Never! Always with her head down. Always with her head down before men, before religion, before the inevitability of bearing children. Me, child of the left... What do I owe this woman with the pretty downcast eyes? What do I do with all my money, with my Mercedes worth 300 grand? with my house in Lub?ron, Yes, in Lub?ron! I'm staying with my woman, under the pretext that she has a flat stomach and a prize-winning ass? Is that it? Is that so crazy? I'm going to do the first really fine thing of my life! - Nacifa? - Nacifa. No! Yes! I'm going to take her in my arms, away to a beautiful place where she can finally relax and become a woman again. You are not going to do this? We will live simply, in a little house. We'll have a vegetable garden, rabbits, a few chickens. In the morning we will sleep late and when she opens her pretty eyes, she sees before her a cup of coffee, which I bring her on a tray! You're making me sick with this program! Over time she will grow more and more pale, when inundated by the sun on her sheets, which are in disorder, while images of the night before, return to make her blush. It's enough to make her faint, which surprises her. A calm after the storm... After madness. Yes, that's enough to make a poor man of the Left move to the right without even noticing it. He must resist! To everyone's surprise! So you're sick of my program, eh? I'm not just sick of it, I want to die from it. Die? And why? Die. Back home, lie down and never get up. - To wait for Death? - To wait for Death. I do not understand why my decision to start a new life with a woman makes you want to die. It's just an old man's depression. You should consult a specialist. - Poor fool! - You're calling me a poor fool? You're the poor fool now! Obviously a poor fool! The good man who without warning walked through your door because he wanted to, to ensure that you were pissed off... He was right. I'd like to know why! You will. This woman, that you call Nacifa, of whom you are delirious, not even knowing if she would look at you, She is your cleaning lady? Yes. - That comes to you from 2 to 6? - Yes. And in the morning, what does she do from 8 am until noon? She has an old man. I am this old man. This is unpleasant. Very unpleasant. We look like a couple of fools. Especially you! Especially me, how so? Imagine that your Nacifa, fool, has the same effect on me that she has on you! She excites me! Are you saying that you and her... I've never touched her! I respect her. She is sacred. You're a disgusting old bastard. I forbid you to talk to me in that tone! You know nothing about me! You'll find I am a very good person. That would surprise me. Sometimes one is surprised. By what? I do not know. By a gesture, by something that seems new. By the shoulder, the arm... The hand! The unexpected gesture. What gesture? The opened hand that stretches out to you. An unexpected smile, a desire to sing. The old bitch that wants to piss you off. You know the old bitch? - What old bitch? - Death. Hasn't she visited you yet? To flirt with you? "I'll leave you my card, you never know..." No. Not yet. For me she came very early. "I tell you that I love you". I was seated, and I didn't move. "What are you doing?" she asked me. "Nothing", I answered. "I'm waiting for you". That evening I'd turned 60. I sat in my dining room, alone with my birthday cake, that I got for myself. I make my own company. Especially on holidays. I don't like holidays. But 60 years old is 60 years old, the beginning of the end. Are you interested in my life? Yes. Very. 60 lighted candles, and behind them Death is watching me. She invited herself. What does Death look like? Very old and very tired. She reeks of fatigue. I offered her a piece of cake, "No, thank you", she replied. I don't like sweets. Death doesn't eat cake. "Me neither", I replied. I bought the cake only for the candles. But they'll soon go out. We must go. I'll go get my jacket. Not tonight, not tonight. I'll be back another time. This evening I can't take anymore. I had a difficult day. All these people didn't want to go with me. I think I'll be going now. I really want to go with you! Perhaps, but now you cannot come. it will all be worked out. - That's annoying! - What's annoying? - Life's annoying! - What life? My own! Damn it. I beg you, Madam, take me with you! It's the first time I've wanted to go on a trip! I'm not afraid! Your case doesn't interest me. You're too eager. You get to have it like you want. Your eyes are cold! My life is an empty shop! There is no one to mourn me! I come to put you out! I don't take passengers without luggage. I can find luggage! Give me 5 minutes! Do you have something to put in it? Nothing. - Not even one pleasant memory? - Not at all, I'm telling you! Try to find something that will cause grief, and put it in your sack. But what? Who? A woman. A man. Even an animal. But I don't like animals. You're pissing me off. And I don't like pushy people. I'm not even here for you. And then she disappeared, dumping me like a piece of shit. And yet she'd given me a false sense of joy, Like Provence. Like music. All the things that have left me cold. What an annoying life I've had! No children, no needs. I had a little money, placed on the stock exchange. I'm naturally stingy. I married a woman, but she quickly died. I did not grieve for her. I said boring things. I ate canned food. On the streets I noticed nothing. Dogs shitting on the sidewalks. Filth everywhere. In the country, bad weather. Reading boring books. And suddenly, one day, at a butcher's... What did I care for a butcher, when I never liked meat? And then, when I paid for my two cutlets... Two pork cutlets! Why not a leg of lamb? I said to myself: "How am I going to prepare these two cutlets? I've never cooked cutlets. And it is precisely at this moment, I assure you I'm not lying, What did I see right next to the cash register? There was an ad stuck up with duct tape. "Looking for housekeeping work. 0149889418." You know the number? Yes, it's Nacifa's number. Excuse me, this is very important. I am experiencing one of the most beautiful moments in life. 010149889418. A young woman answered, with a sunny voice. Hello. I'm having a problem with cutlets. What kind of cutlets? They are good, but I do not know how to cook them. And where are you? Lane Peplier. Number 27, Metro station "Poterne". My name is Monsieur Pottier. I'm going. She said she should be there in half an hour. I'll bring the butter. When she arrived, she carried a bouquet. I said to myself: "A man living alone, I should bring him some flowers". Won't you take off your coat? I don't have the time. I've got two hours to get to the other end of Paris. Will you come tomorrow? I'll come every day. I was left all alone. I felt a little drunk. And for the first time the sun filled my apartment. Now do you understand? What is there to understand? Every morning, before going to work for you, she came to fill my life with sun. Every morning I get up at dawn, clean like crazy, clean the toilet and the bathtub, Iron my shirts and my pants, so that she has nothing to do that would soil her own hands. - So what was she doing? - She rested. She spent time on herself. She read magazines. I bought her magazines! Very often she slept, she needed the extra sleep. All of her nights were very short, she had a child that was sick, then at dawn her husband came in demanding sex from her. Did you know that he beats her? She tells me everything, he beats her. Not only he doesn't work, but he gets drunk and beats her! She had a bruise the other day. In the middle of her back! He hit her with a chair. Punishment with a chair! And all because she refused. No. No! Oh, no! Still, he is my husband. The father of my children. The man I loved. But my dear, we're in France, on French territory and with French rights. You need to go to the doctor, and then the police. A man who beats his wife with a chair should be in jail. You hear me, Nacifa? Report him for the sake of his children. Or one day they will witness something terrible! You want me to find you a lawyer? I'll lend you the money. Nacifa, tell me yes, tell me that you will accept my help. But she did not answer. She had dozed off. So quietly. I took off her shoes. I covered her with a blanket. She slept until noon. When she woke, everything was well, she was very hungry. I'd prepared everything, meatballs and soft mussels. She devoured it all. I devoured his life. What a strange effect. And she's been with you for how long? For two beautiful years. You've paid her well? I pay her 120 francs per hour. For doing nothing? For doing nothing. And when she sleeps, I pay her double. And you've never touched her? Never. Even when she was sleeping? Even when she was sleeping. You're a fool. Well, when she sleeps, I cannot say that from time to time, I don't get the idea of putting my hands on her. This happens from time to time. In fact, it happens more and more! But you what do you want? She sleeps so deeply. She clearly lacks sleep. And it's been so long since I've felt any remnant of passion And her in bed, defeated by fatigue. I touch her breasts a little. She doesn't notice. I touch her thighs. She doesn't notice. Even the inside of her thighs. She doesn't notice. And your erection, what was it like? Immediate. Like lightning! Everything happens in the blink of an eye. Put off, I get an erection! I'm on the stairs, I have an erection! At any time of the day! I only have to think of her, I get an erection. Well, if you've got an erection, sit down. Thank you. And while she slept, you haven't tried to take advantage of her? Never. Why not? Maybe she's been expecting it. A sleeping woman? You cannot take advantage of a sleeping woman! If you do everyhing properly, she won't even notice. What a scoundrel you are! Enough of that. You aren't so clean! No more than I am. Be careful what you say! I stand by what I say! A young woman that takes 120 francs an hour to come and sleep, for the old man that likes it... I call that dishonest! I call that marvelous! Marvelous in the eyes of a woman, who takes care of everyone while no one takes care of her. I take care of her! It's a point of pride. I treat her like a princess. And does she thinks that's normal? She finds that very normal! And she never asks any questions? She never asks any questions. In any case, at the beginning. Later on, she asked. What questions? I want to know all her questions! For example, one day... She was on the bed. She had taken a bath, which I had run for her, She was wrapped in a white robe, which I had bought her. She painted her toenails red with "Flamenco" varnish by Chanel, A color that is so becoming to brunettes. Suddenly, I felt that she had a problem. A cloud passed before her eyes. I want to say: She looked at me, and illuminated the room. There shone a fountain of light, and then in her eyes the vulture returned. What vulture? The vulture of anxiety. It created an icy shame, like any scavenger. Have you ever experienced this? You think I've got a buzzard in my head? It isn't a desert up there! You don't like poetry. Not yours! You're just breaking my balls. You've said nothing. It's all confused. Excuse me, when I talk about her, I feel giddy. But I also feel giddy! Look how giddy I am with my ladder! My ladder, too, is poetry. What do you think? Don't you find it poetic? It's disgusting, what you're doing! Well? Where were we? Regarding what? You were telling me your story, but it's not yet finished. You remember the ending? Where were we? I don't remember. I'm so confused! She was on the bed! Bathrobe! Varnish! Nails! And where were you? At her feet, obviously. And what did she say to you? She looked at me strangely. This you've already said! "Vultures, clouds in her eyes"... What happened next? You see, with age... it's unnerving! You start a phrase that, at first, this never-ending phrase, you expect will be easy to complete, but after a point you start another. I want to know what she told you! Why are you all doing this for me? You give me so much. It gives me pleasure. I'm at an age when it gives pleasure. Yes, but I don't give you anything. I get everything and give nothing. You give me your presence. It fills my life. But are you satisfied with this? Yes, I'm satisfied. For example, right now when I look at you, I see your leg and shoulder. Fine. It is true that if your robe opened a little, I could see more, but if I see more, perhaps I'll be miserable. You want me? Yes, obviously, I want you. Don't you want to come and take off my robe? Don't you want to come and take off my robe? And you went to her? Of course I went to her! And you fucked her? Of course I fucked her! I fuck her every morning. You're not going to fuck her every day? You'll have a heart attack! Don't fool yourself, I'm in great shape! My heart is strong as a bull. It ticks like a clock! As for my analysis, it's completely clean. No trace of cholesterol. It's even lacking. I could use a little more butter. How's your prostate? My prostate is very supple. I have the prostate of a teenager. I am happy with him. He treats me like a queen. My youth is dazzled... And he never hurts me. I know it won't last long, it's too good to be true. One day I will have to go back to normal life. It's shit. Outside of this miracle, in life there are only bad surprises. But happiness does exist. Do you believe in happiness? He's made me believe in it. Are you feeling sluggish? I am a little tired. Everyone's a little tired. Go away. I want to be alone. I came to talk to you! We've done nothing but talk! I want to talk about your hallway. What about my hallway? In the hallway there is something you don't understand. What? When Nacifa walks by, you old imbecile... When she comes out of the kitchen with a pile of laundry. When she leans against the wall, so that you can pass her. When you passed her so indifferently. You know what she said to herself? I am not indifferent! I want to know so bad it makes me sick! You know what she said to herself? What did she say to herself? "Why doesn't he brush against me?" "Why doesn't he touch me?" But she didn't want me to! I'm asking you if she wanted me to? Do you find that agreeable? Yes. For some time now. Very agreeable! So what do you want to tell me? Something that will cost me. Regarding Nacifa? I have a message from her. What message? What message? I need to find the words. Oh, are you going to dodge my questions again? She talked to me about you. When? How? What did she say? It's something a little vague. I'm a little ashamed of it. But at the same time, it makes me happy. I feel that ever since that time, when I first slept with you. I feel myself being watched. All the time I'm being watched. In the street, for example. When I'm leaving your place. I see men watching me. They look at me. They look at me in a new way. It seems that they know. That I just left someone, that I've just gotten dressed, that while I was dressing, he's given me money. An old gentleman, who's very nice, but also a little crazy. But she hasn't mentioned me! Wait, she's only getting started. It's very interesting, being a woman. Do you still have some chocolates? Of course I do! I bought a whole box! Then why isn't it here on the bed beside me? I'll go find it. It's in the fridge! One day, you little bastard, I'll grab you in your hallway and you'll forget your name... What's right, what's left... You'll be between my thighs. And that will make a pretty picture! Didn't you hear? Someone rang! Well, go get the door! But I have no idea who it could be! I never have visitors. And yet, someone's ringing! Go answer the door! Will it bother you to open the door? That'll cost me! That'll cost me! Is that someone playing tricks? I told you it was no one! What are you up to? Who's that? Us? Yes, you! What are you up to? Nothing! We haven't moved a centimeter! How is it you have the same robe as me? - Who? Me? - Yes, you. And if it isn't my door? - That what? - That somebody buzzes! Then it's your door! Not yours, perhaps? But what are you doing here? I've come looking for my son! Could you call him a son? I have very weak nerves, I cannot bear being contradicted. I am a broken woman. Not at all, you are not broken! Look at you! I am! Look at me! Here we go! Now I'm crying. You can be proud of your victory! Excuse me, I have a call! A call? What call? You have a cellphone? Of course I do! When you fall in love, you buy a cell. And here I am! - Who is this, anyway? - This is my best friend! - Can't you shut up? - Can't you open the door? I have absolutely no desire to! Forgive me, Nacifa, there's some sick person here. Javier! It's Mommy! Javier! Open the door, so she can pick up her fag of a son! My son is not a fag! Don't worry, my darling. She wants to talk to you. Hello? Good, it's finished. What are you up to? I've been calling for an hour. I was with Agatha. What did you do with Agatha? Understood. Congratulations! In my opinion, it took so long because of all that had to be done. I won't come tomorrow. Not tomorrow, nor any other day. I do not want to be watched, met in hallways, desired in silence. Barely saying hello, barely saying goodbye. Always this excitement, when you give me money. Your money doesn't bother me, your behavior doesn't bother me. What bothers me is your embarrassment, your bad conscience. And the pain of feeling like a woman. - Could I interrupt a moment? - Yes. I'm not going to pick up Javier. I won't have him anymore. Never. You can do your filth together. - Nacifa! - Yes sir? Mommy! What are you doing? I feel dirty! Do you have someone to look after your children? In Maghreb families there's always someone to look after the children. Agatha, I need to talk to you. What do you want to talk about? Do you remember this recent business about a blouse? - Nacifa, if you please! - I'm here, Mademoiselle. - Do you recognize this blouse? - It's your pink blouse. This was my pink blouse. You see these sleeves? What do you think of them? They are short. What do you think it cost? Why? Did you pay for it? Nacifa, do you know why you were born? Yes. Because my mother made love with my father. Me too. My mother made love with my father. This happened in the 16th arrondisement! From this I have some bourgeois habits. And until proven otherwise, this is not a crime. I've made a decision. I'm keeping Nacifa. It's you who must leave. Do you think she will come? Of course she will come. Is it, in fact... She's going to share us. Do you know what's going to happen? Here? At this moment? No. I'm going to become a good man. Go, go open the door! I'm coming! I'm coming! I've come to negociate. Negociate for what? Are you interested in my wife or not? Her name is Nacifa. An Algerian. He's interested. You've come to sell her? How much can you offer? You piece of shit... Careful, it's loaded! I'm no choirboy! You pay one way or another! Money or blood! I consider myself humiliated! I do not like it when people look at my wife. Neither at the fount nor in the hallway! I'm a Maghreb. A proud people, the Maghreb! Scum, more likely. - Who? The Maghreb? No, you! Crooks are everywhere. Even in Francophone countries. You don't have crooks in your beautiful France? Be careful of what you say! You are in my house, in my country. Be careful of people who know their way around! We come to do your dirty work! Clean up after your shit! - It stinks, your shit! - And yours doesn't? It stinks less, because we eat less. I don't give a damn! I'm clean, so I don't have this problem of conscience. Doesn't that shock you, buying a woman? I'm not buying a woman, I'm buying some happiness. Place it at his feet and watch him smile. Provided that Nacifa smiles. Nacifa? She smiles. Provided you don't beat her, she smiles. So if you want my advice, beat her. - We will follow your advice. - We will follow his advice? - We'll follow it, we'll follow it. - But I don't want to beat her! - We must beat her a little. - But why? In order to drive out any bad thoughts. Imagine what she might do with us, just like this poor guy. She might brush against other men in other hallways. Myself, I love Nacifa! She was my only home. When I learned that she brushed against others, from this moment I began to suffer! Because I learned she brushes against them! Excuse me, before brushing against, she had the old man. I don't give a damn if she sleeps with an old man. It was an old man, after all. She did a lot for me! "It was an old man, after all. She did a lot for me!" So much the better, I told myself. So much the better for the old man. When you have a beautiful wife, you can afford to leave crumbs. Let them nibble. Why make a scene? Yes, I beat her up a bit, for prevention. A woman is like a rug: She needs to be beaten once in a while. With a chair? - I forbid you to talk about the chair! I will talk about this chair! It drives me mad, this chair! She didn't want to admit it. - Admit what? She did not want to admit it. And I knew there was something to admit to! Something more serious. I could see it in her eyes. To know a woman's eyes, you must immerse yourself in them. To see the sun, or menacing clouds farther off. What's this about the eyes? They become troubled. They show more sun, or show menacing clouds. In such cases, we must take up a chair! I saw it all, understood everything! Like in the sixth society! I saw him there. The man of the hallway like a thief. I saw everything. Eyelet linen falling down. No. I swear! He never touched me! And I, who was choking and dying of love! Meddler! Calm yourself, my boy. Calm down. The next day I lost my job. Unemployed! I began to fall apart. I started to drink. From bistro to bistro. From bad encounters to bad encounters. I took her money. I spent it on other women. Women who couldn't hold a candle to her. Ready to do anything to have a drink, ready to degrade myself. I took all the money. A lot of money. Nacifa never saw it. I have spent on gambling, the racetrack, cards. How do you pay for it all? A life broken by bastards that look at his woman, for whom power is the permanent solution. Of course, she's poor! Of course, she's humble! And her man beats her! Of course, she will be happy! Overflowing with gratitude. Of course she'll submit when you bring her to Lub?ron and when she can jump in the pool with my children! And I'll be all right! So how much will you give me, Man of the Left, for your sublime story? For your renewal? - I'm not a buyer. - He's not a buyer! I suggest he's the biggest there is, Mr. "not a buyer"! You're not alone in this matter! I'm with you! Keep out of this! You won't leave her to suffer with this scum? Look at the goods. The quality of the goods! In six months, after the chair, I'll put her on the street. You'll come as a client. And you won't even know it. This will be a great victory, after Lub?ron. - What have you done? - Who, me? I did nothing! - You just fired a revolver! - Yes, in fact. - You killed an Arab. - You think so? Yes, I assure you. Look at your pool! Oh, shit! That was completely stupid! - Yes, perhaps. - But what got into you? But it was his own fault! He got excited, he grabbed at his belt, and in his belt was a pistol. - You shot an Arab? - Don't say "Arab", say "Maghreb". For me, a woman is a Maghreb, and a man is an Arab. You are truly a man of the Right! Yes, but I'm against the death penalty. Especially in private cases. - What's with this ambulance? - What ambulance? There. Are you Mr. Grison? That's right. We need your signature. Why do you need it? To verify that we showed up. - Where? - To you. We're all well here. No one is sick. He's looking well! Have a good day! Get out. You hear what I said? Get out! What's this thunder? Probably a big storm. The sky is clear. There are no clouds! Come on now, it's time to go back. Go back where? To Paris? No, not Paris! We're in Lub?ron! In Lub?ron? Oh, he's tired! I must think of something to remind him. Do you remember that you have a house in Provence? Yes, is it all right? Completely. You see it? There it is. It's beautiful. Isn't it? You hear the cicadas? Absolutely. Absolutely. It's in Provence you hear cicadas, am I right? That's for sure! That's for sure! We get on well, us two. You think so? Why are you pushing me? To get you moving! But why would I move, in the name of God? Are you looking for us? I'm looking for a woman. - What woman? - There is no woman here. There are women everywhere. You only have to scratch around and you can find one. Well, it would be nice if there was one. I would like it if there was a woman, preferably two. But here we are, two old fools, alone, and we haven't the energy. I've got the energy! I followed your advice. I packed a suitcase. It's so full that it won't close. Have you tried sitting on it? We've been so busy! Where's your bag? In here, in here. It's too small, your suitcase! I had nothing to take, so I chose a small suitcase. But I had some large stuff that I had to take with me. This robe needs to be thrown in the machine. Never. It must retain its scent! I don't smell anything. It smells a little like a kitchen. Maybe you've lost your sense of smell. I haven't lost my sense of smell! It's only a matter of time. A good wife smells so many things, is she to blame if she grows insensible to them? When I smell the robe, I smell the scent of the woman who wore it. I like running across her chest like water. I am between her thighs. I am a drop that has found its niche. You've certainly been having fun these days! Even today I am still in shape and can do some things. You will show us, then! But I don't want you! What's that? You don't excite me! Take off your pants, buddy! You'll have to try to get it up. I don't want to be stiff! With me, all men are stiff! Well, I'm slack! Slow! Floppy! Like an old jaw. You've gone a little too far! Then go after it, if it turns you on! Your friend has caused me so much pain! You shouldn't hold it against him. He's been through a lot recently. Me too I've been through a lot. Because of Nacifa? You know her? Obviously. She's my next parcel. A secret disease devours her. What are you talking about? Sorry, old man. You're very nice, but I'm doing my job, and my duty is to tell you that your Nacifa is my next parcel. Forgive me for what using this unpoetic word, but she has cancer. What? I can confirm this. These women are never treated, they never go to a gynecologist, They are full of life, but not for long. What's the time by your watch? 17 hours, 15 minutes. Then my time is correct. At this time she should be on the bus. If she took a taxi, I'd be surprised. She's not the sort to take a taxi. She's coming here? She is very happy. In the train she said to the woman next to her: "I am very happy." She thought she was mad. Mr. Pottier! What is my illness? Something in your stomach, that's started to grow and soon will invade everything. A poisonous black flower. But I am life itself. I'm beautiful and happy. There must be something wrong. Can't you tell her that she's made a mistake? This is obviously a mistake! It's not me! Come with us, Madam. You will be cured. But she's on my list! You need glasses! They're broken! Don't explode, Madam! You must keep cool! Don't push her. She gets angry quickly. But why don't they take off? Are you going to leave or not? That bitch is staring at me! Her eyes frighten me! I have a feeling that I got my feet filthy in some swamp! It's disgusting! Well, all this is enough! I'm not afraid of you! Your face doesn't scare me! I'm ready to go to the next world! You can take me. But Nacifa you won't dare touch her! She needs a vacation! She's never been on one. Me neither! Not even a little time off! I'm always on duty! Damn! And always evil looks! Not one smile! Never a thank you! But I've come to help! Take my hand! Look, I'll take your hand in mine. Do you feel it? It calms you a little? Or are you still afraid? Death is up for anything that would seduce the customer! I can even be nice! Look at my smile! I can even dance, I'm such fun! Look how I dance! Come dance with me! I want to stay a little while longer. What? What did you say? I want to stay a little longer. Why do you want to stay? There are still some things I have to do. Listen, I'm sorry, my brave girl. Unfortunately I can't help it. The bleeding has already begun. What bleeding? She'll feel nothing! She'll lose all her blood and all her strength. She won't even have the strength to cry. What's more, crying is not her style. She's a brave girl. Isn't that right? Aren't you a brave girl? Yes, I'm quite brave. And to die in the sun is better than dying in the cold. Yes, you're right. This isn't the time to contradict you. What's your pleasure, until your strength has left you? Whatever you want, it's yours! A walk in the garden. Good idea! Good idea! Where is it? By the swimming pool. Good idea! Good idea! What are you doing? You're completely crazy! - You know how to swim? - Yes, I know how to swim! Well, then. Swim! You can't blame me? - Well, maybe. - We'll get your old mug! - But, this is absurd! - Goodbye, goodbye! See how easy it is? Who's next? Old men who will not die! The young who work twice as hard than would pay for their pension. And what about those who can no longer be tolerated? Villains, Monsters! What will you do with them? Which ones? The scum! The shit of the earth! What will you do with them? Beat them? Grant them eternal life? But you cannot wish them to die! Oh, really? Hitler! Do you miss him? And Stalin! Do you weep thinking of him? You're one of those who are so fond of Arabs. What do you say about the people who tortured Jamil Muharega? They're still alive! French examples? Would you like me to name them? Nacifa! What will they do at the hospital? Nothing! What do you want them to do? Then why are we going? Remove your hand from my knee! Why would I remove it? It interferes with my work! That is exactly what I want! Prevent you from harming her! Nobody can stop me! But we aren't like the others. We aren't going to give up! We're French! And the French are always fighting. We don't believe this story about everyone dying. It's bullshit! What do you mean? It isn't nonsense. I am Death! - Not at all. - Yes! - It's impossible! - And why is it impossible? You want to look frightening, but in reality you're just pathetic. Death is a German invention! There is nothing German about life. You're like a dried-up riverbed! - How long have you been unhappy? - What's that? In the arms of men! Have you ever had two men at once? Both of them hard! It's time! You're both sick! I don't understand, I don't understand! It stops and starts, then stops and starts again! It's crazy. I don't think she can be resuscitated! I've never seen anything like it! Listen, get ready! We'll take care of it! Let's see what we've got to work with! It's an old belt. I've stretched it out a little. That'll work well, very well. Leave me alone! Why didn't you do as much for us? We didn't ask you! Shit! I'm getting stiff! Then you better go at it, old man. Come on! Look out for the good wood! Better not let up, guys. Otherwise I'll have to get back to work! She doesn't care, the bitch isn't even looking at me! Allow me to work here! Like a piston! Like a piston! Don't stop now. We're not there yet. But until when? Until when!
