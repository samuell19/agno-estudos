Fantasize. - Wish. * It goes, it goes, it goes - Hope. (typing) (knocking at door) - Alice? - Door's open! - Hey. - [Alice] Hey, Madison. - [Madison] Whatcha doing? - I'm makin' a website. - (groans) Alice. - [Alice] No no no, it's not for work, I swear! It's my own project, 52 Words for Love. - [Madison] Well, you're never going to figure out love sitting alone in front of your computer. - [Alice] I don't know, I've just never really been in love. I've never really loved anybody. - [Madison] You love me. - Yes, but I'm not in love with you, Mads. (Madison laughs) And I wanna be in love. - [Madison] How about food? When's the last time you ate? - [Alice] (laughing) Don't start with me, woman. - Get out of that room and come hang out with me. - Check this out, Hafez, 14th century Persian poet. Today love has completely gutted me. I'm lying in the market like a filleted grouper. (Madison laughs) I wanna be a filleted grouper. - [Madison] Oh, goodness, I don't know what I'm gonna do with you. * Ooh * We are * Oh who * We are * Oh... (door latch clicks) - Hey! - Oh, hi. - [Lily] How's it going? - Hi. - How was your day? - Not bad, not bad, how about you? - It was wonderful, wonderful, I'm gonna take a shower. - [Nick] I'm gonna get some tea. (kettle whistles) - [Eva] Did you hear from Dad? - [Nora] What? - [Eva] 'Cause I did. - What the fuck? - Don't freak out, please. - What the fuck? - Yeah. It's really weird. He posted this picture online of me when I was a kid, in a box. - [Nora] Okay. - I think it's his way of trying make peace with us, so-- - Has he asked about me? - No, but I know that he wants to see you too. - We should talk to Mom. We should ask her if she knows anything about this. - [James] Hello. - [Nora] I can see you, hi. (Eva and James laugh) Who is this person? - That's James, that's my boyfriend. - What? (laughing) - So, any...boys? - I've been crushing out on this dude, which is kinda weird because I don't really, I don't have crushes on people, like ever and, I dunno, he's just, he's kind of gorgeous, like he's like tall, and has freckles. - [Eva] He sounds cute. (helicopter rotors whirring) (sirens wailing) - [Anne] Energy level, between 1 and 10, 1 being the lowest, 10 the highest, - [Alice] Seven. Seven and a half. - Okay. Do you drink coffee? - [Alice] Not a lot. - [Anne] Do you use recreational drugs? - [Alice] No. - [Anne] Do you drink alcohol? - [Alice] I drink a glass of wine once in awhile. - [Anne] Okay, do you smoke cigarettes? - No. - Never have? Never have, right, good for you. [Anne] Okay the doctor will be in to see you shortly. Just hang tight. - [Keegan] So how's work? - A little quiet tonight, which is nice. How 'bout you, what's goin' on? - [Keegan] Nothing. - Nothing? - I don't know. - Boring. - Yeah. That's why I'm here every day. Think I want to hang out with you just because? - Yes I do. (both laughing) How was it at the observatory last night? - It was quiet, so there weren't a lot of people there, and you could just sort of like, stare up and just think. - [Anne] The sky was pretty clear last night. - [Keegan] Yeah, it was amazing, a perfect night for it. I look up and all I see is this tiny fraction of what's out there. - Yeah. - All I want is to see 100% of it. - [Anne] So if somebody offered you a ride to Mars, you'd take it? - [Keegan] Yeah. - [Anne] Yeah, really? - [Keegan] There's so much I need to learn. I just wanna learn it all, you know? - [Sam] Still like drinking coffee? - [Julia] Yeah, I've upgraded to espresso though. (chuckling) And chocolate-covered cocoa beans too. (both laughing) Thank you. - [Sam] So I hear you got married. - Yes. Divorced now though. - Oh. - Yeah. You? - Separated. - [Julia] Kids? No? - No kids. - [Julia] No kids. - [Sam] No, you? - [Julia] (chuckling) (blows raspberry) No. No, no, Silly but not stupid, so, yeah. - Happy? - Yeah, yeah!

Crumble. Accept. Welcome. Receive. - [Interviewee] There are different kinds of heartbreak. One is like the slow realization heartbreak. And then there's the kind of stabbed in the chest heartbreak, which is immediate and intense. Once my teeth hurt. My teeth actually hurt. - Sometimes I've been given to these great demonstrations of heartbreak. And I was flying somewhere and I had to go to ask the flight attendant something and I was just holding it in my belly, 'cause I was so heartbroken. And he's like, 'are you sick? oh my God'. I was like, no, the airsickness bag won't heal this. - My dad used to tell me and all my siblings when we were heartbroken, he'd say, "Nobody dies from love." You know, it's never happened. You're gonna grow out of it and move on. And then my mom and dad split up and I told him, "Dad, nobody dies from love." And he said, "I'm gonna be the first one." - I do know I had my heart broken. And when I look back I think, why in the world did I ever care? (both laughing) (Eva moans) - Hello. - [May] You sure you don't want to do sock? - No stinky sock. - [May] It just came out of the dryer, take a sniff. - [Katie] No. - What are you doing? (Katie giggles) - [May] What are you doing? - [Nora] I'll tickle you, I will tickle you. - Do not, do not. - I will tickle you, yes. (laughing) - Hey, hey! (Katie blows raspberry) Oh, come on! - [Katie] Two points for me. (May laughing) (Katie blows raspberry) - I love it when James is away. - [Eva] I miss him. - I want to go to see a play, and I want to go dancing, and I want to go to-- - I had an idea. Don't hate it right away. I was thinking that we could (tuts) - No! - go and surprise Dad. - No! - Come on. - I'm not here to see him, I'm here to see you! - I know but I, it would be nice-- - No, I don't care. - It would help the situation. - I don't wanna talk to him. We share DNA and nothing else. - It's fine, we'll do whatever you wanna do, okay? (Eva sighs) - [Nora] I wonder if Dad still lives in our old house. - [Eva] I don't know, I don't think so. - [Nora] He probably threw out my Penny doll. - [Eva] Yes, Penny doll is probably biodegrading somewhere. - Oh, that's an awful thought. (Eva laughs) I wasn't gonna come. - I'm glad you did. Here, you drive. (soft music) (fiddle music) - [James] It was a pretty good gig. The people who owned the pub were a really nice couple. They were tellin' stories and hangin' out with some other old dudes and tellin' more stories. And it was really nice. (fiddle music) - [Eva] Do you still get butterflies when I call? - [James] I can't answer that question. - Why? (laughing) - I can't give you that kind of power. (both laughing) I love coming home to you. - I...haven't had a home since I was a kid. And it just seems like I've been looking for it for my whole life since then. - [James] I want a home too. I wanna have someone who's got my back too, you know? - [Eva] I've got your back. - [James] Yeah, that's nice. (cell phone buzzes) (Raymond sighs) (Raymond breathes heavily) - [Raymond] We had a huge fight. We can talk about it as rational adults, but we have just treated each other like crap. And uh I'm thinking I might, I might want to end it. - [Mum] That's really painful. - [Raymond] I can't remember a single time that she's made me laugh. 15 years and I'm going back, going, I never laughed, you know, but I don't know, I don't know, Mom, I'm, I don't wanna be alone. You know, I'm-- - What is it you want? In this family? - I don't know what I want. I want it to work, you know. - Well if you want it to work, get somebody to help you to talk to each other to see if there's anything worth saving. I can tell you how proud I am of you. - Thanks. (sirens wailing) - [Sam] When I first moved out, I had a queen-size air mattress here. And it had these really deep grooves that ran all the way vertically. - Okay. - And one night, I thought someone got in bed 'cause I felt a push against my back. (both laughing) The stitches came out and the air mattress just bloated up on one side. - Oh, my God. - I froze. (Julia laughing) I kept thinking, don't make any sudden moves, and it didn't move either. (both laughing) - Sorry. - Ever since that, I keep a knife under the bed. (both laughing) - That's awesome! I'm not alarmed at all. - No, I know. - I'm not alarmed. I'm glad you have a real bed now. - I did forget one question. How many people have you had sex with? - (laughing) It's not important to count. - Come on, I'm asking. - When you said love I thought, oh no, they are going to ask me how many people I slept with. - I had a really funny answer to this but I forgot what it was. - 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80... - If you give me 10 minutes, I may be able to give you a close number. - Well, I really like sex, I was pretty promiscuous. You were talking about the fifties, right? (laughing) - Some people are just looking for the One. (man and woman chuckling) - Hello! - Mary was my first girlfriend, so you can imagine the passion that was available. (both laughing) - All stored up! - [Raymond] My best guess? Six months from now you'll be back on your feet. Your prognosis is really good overall, and your specialist is the best. I actually know her, I dated her in med school. She'll take good care of you. If you need anything, just call me on my mobile, k? You look like you could use some lunch. - [Alice] It's just a six-month leave of absence. - Seriously? May, we need human resources in here now. - [Alice] You're not talking me out of this. - Do I need to take you down with a full body tackle? 'Cause you know I will. - [Alice] I'm taking some time to work on my own project. - Work on it here. - We can monetize it. - You can't leave, you are our tech head. - There's no escaping us. - Do you need a raise? Or what about a corner office? - [Alice] (laughing) I need some time off. (acoustic guitar music) * Hey ho * Let it go * And on and on we * Go * Ever easy - [Alex] Hi, I'm Alex. - [Jen] I'm Jen, I'm here to support my dad. - [Rod] I'm Rod. I'm here to support my brother Jude, I guess. Even though he's decided he's not coming to group anymore. He said he'd rather ride his bike. * Calling you, calling you home * - He's mad at me because I was trying to talk to him about - dying. All I got was this mini lecture about conservation of energy how it can't be created or destroyed, it's just transferred between systems. Honestly, I don't know how to do this. I really don't. And the way things are going, I don't think we have much time. I'm sorry. - I'm Liz, I'm here with my husband William. [Liz] I get feeling crazy powerless just watching. - That was fast. - [Alice] Yeah, I don't really belong in there. I know how much you love this group, but I'm not sick like they are. - You're only as sick as your secrets, right? - [Jax] Worse-case scenario, we sell the company. - [May] Worse-case scenario, we run away and join the circus. - We could always do the high wire act. - [May] I hear there is a great demand for trapeze artists. - All we need is bridge financing. - I'd make an excellent lion tamer. (imitates whip snapping) - [Jax] I'm doing the best that I can. - [May] Just trying to be funny here. - And dramatic! - How did we get so dysfunctional? - We work too much. - [Katie] When I go to the circus, I could ride an elephant! (May sighs) - [Scott] You need a compelling topic and a strong thesis statement. - [Keegan] It is a compelling topic. - It's possible that our three-dimensional universe is actually floating in a four-dimensional universe, and that we are living in a membrane around the event horizon of a collapsed four-dimensional star. So our stars, nebula, planets, even us may be part of that membrane and that its expansion might be caused by motion through a higher dimensional reality. - Yeah. - You need to use terse sentence structure, be concise. Explain that to me in a way that I can understand, in English. (both laughing) - [Sam] Julia. - Sam! Hey. Andrew, this is Sam; Sam, Andrew. Yeah, oh my gosh, I'm bumping into you, working out as per usual. - Yeah. - Making me, shaming me right now, that's okay, - Well, I'm not gonna keep you. - Okay, take care. - All right, well, I'll see you around. - Okay, okay. - [Sam] Take care. - So that's The Sam? - Yes, that's The Sam. - You okay? - Well, I met with Eva the other day. - [Lily] Okay. - We talked a bit. - Okay. - I found a way to communicate with her, and... - [Lily] How is she? - She's, you know, she's mad at stuff that happened, but it's mostly, it's mostly at me, for what it's worth. - What about Nora? - I don't know. I don't think there's any opening there at the moment. - [Lily] It's kind of strange, I suppose. - Yeah. - I don't know them at all. Anymore, I guess, I don't know. - I just hope it... You know, I hope we can get somewhere this time. - Me too. - Thanks love, thank you. - [Lily] What can I do? (Lily smooches) [Lily] I guess, whatever you gotta do. (receptionist speaks faintly on PA) (telephone ringing) (Alice exhales) - [Alice] (sighs) I think I need to call a cab. - I think you need to sit down. Here. You all right? - Yeah. A little woozy. - [Anne] Alright, I'm gonna call someone to pick you up. who is your emergency contact person? (juicer whirs) - Here you go, my ultimate hangover cure. I'm sure it'll work. You know, Alice, I can stay here with you until you feel better. - You gonna hold my hair while I barf? (Madison laughs) (scrub brush rasping) [Alice] Comfort. Support. Help. Kindness. Sympathy. Generosity. Consideration. (rain pattering) (cell phone beeps) (phone rings) - [Aidan] What's up, Dad? - [Raymond] What's up buddy? How you doing? - Good. I mean, a lot of people went on my server tonight, so that's good. - [Raymond] Are you getting any work done though? - [Aidan] Well, a bit of math work. - You're not watching TV while you're doin' it though, are you? - Oh my God, deja vu. - You can't do that, you gotta just turn off the TV. You're not really concentrating if you have the TV on. - Well, I guess I have no choice but to trust you. (Raymond laughs) - Well I didn't do so great at your age with math either, but I think you have a good brain for it, Aid. I think you should stick with it. - [Aidan] Okay, well I gotta go now. - [Raymond] What's for dinner? - [Aidan] I am having like a Cesar salad. - [Raymond] Okay well you go and eat and I'll pick you up regular time Friday, okay? - Yeah. - [Raymond] I love you, buddy. Take care. - [Aidan] Bye. - That's my boy. * Oh * We climb * Free fall * The light * Here comes * The fall * Ready * We are - [Interviewee] To the extent that I've experienced love, I guess I feel lucky. Maybe it happens again, maybe it doesn't. But it's a mistake to think that life is a failure if I don't. (slow piano music) It will feel that way though. - [James] I really like Eva. - [Kate] Wow, that's big. - [James] Yeah. - [Kate] But? - [James] Remember Margot? - The fiddle player? Oh no! - [James] Oh, yeah. I didn't, like-- - okay, you didn't penetrate. - No. - But you did everything else. (both laughing) - No. (both laughing) And I had to tell her, well, there's no way we're doin' anything, you lunatic, because you're married. And I love your husband as well. - [James] When people really go with their feelings, go with what's with truthful at any time, I don't know, like, what's right or wrong, really? - Yeah. With Joe and me, we were both married to other people and then we had this hot affair. (both laughing) There was a point there where we both felt dishonorable to ignore the love. Like the love was this big thing, you know? - The love between-- - The love between-- - You two? - the two of us. And then my husband, my former husband, found my journals, and then I was kicked out of the house. - Oh no. - Yeah, yeah. - It was really painful. - Jesus. - People get over it, though. I mean the kids got over it. I thought the kids would never get it over it. - They did? - kids got over fine. 'Cause I'm always a little embarrassed when people ask, how did you, I go, oh yeah, we knew each other. But the real story is we fell in love while we were in long-term relationships with other people. - [Sam] So you're still friends with your ex husband. - [Julia] Yes. He's my ex, and he's my friend. - [Sam] What kind of relationship do you think we're having? Not a Capital R relationship. - [Julia] Yeah, sucked at that. - It wasn't so bad. - [Julia] Revisionist. - [Sam] Terrible. - [Julia] Fundamentally incompatible. - But otherwise-- - sexually compatible, yeah. - Not a friendship, exactly. - You're not my friend? You seem awfully friendly for my non-friend. (both laughing) - Some kind of ship, what kind of ship? - Ass-ship. Space-ship. - Mm, in orbit! (both laughing) - Fuck me. (Sam moans) Mm, a fuck-ship! (laughing) - [Sam] A fuck-ship? We're having a fuckship! (both laughing) - [Julia] All aboard, hmm. - He just approached me and said, "Do you wanna go out for coffee?" And I was already having one. - She was attracted to me first. - He didn't seem interested in me at all. (laughing) - I'm thinking coffee or something. He said, "You can come and stay here with me, there's room." Uh... - I'd actually seen Julian probably like a year before. I was very attracted to him but I kind of knew that I wasn't really ready for anything. - I'm looking for where I'm gonna sleep and where I'm gonna put my suitcase. And there was one bedroom. - (laughs) So you knew he was up to something, - So I said, "The problem is, I don't wear anything to bed "when I go to bed." That's okay, I'm a gentleman. (both laughing) He was. - My sister said to me wouldn't it be funny if you married Zen, and I says, nah, never. (both laughing) - Look what happened. - Yes. - 55 years later. - 17 years and it was a mistake. It was a terrible, terrible, terrible mistake. - That was the first time I ever put that trust out there and just kind of felt like the universe would just kind of bring us back together. (fiddle music) - [Interviewee] We had been together for about a month. He told me, "I like you a lot, do you like me a lot?" And I said, yeah I like you a lot. And then he said, "Like, like love me?" And then I said it... (laughing) He bullied me into telling him that I loved him first. - She says before I even get a chance to say it. She's like, "I think I'm in love with you." And I said the same thing to her too, I think I'm in love with you as well. I don't love you, I'm in love with you. Being in love is this state, this state of euphoria, where everything is okay, everything feels right. (switch clicks) (camera beeps and clicks) - Here we go. Do you tell people you're lovers with that you love them? I love you. (laughing) Does that answer your question? (sirens wailing) - [Steve] You ever thought about jumping? - [Alice] Not in the end my life kind of way but, more in the process kind of way. The process of jumping and that moment of weightlessness. I'm not too crazy about what happens after that though. - I used to jump off of the tops of highschools when I was a kid, you know, the snowplow would come around and they'd push all the snow banks up, and we would jump off like the third story into a snowbank. So I'm not actually afraid of jumping, and I'm not really afraid of heights, but there's something... - The inevitable splat. - The deceleration trauma. - Deceleration trauma. - The cement poisoning. - Right, the road rash. - The asphalt overdose. - The blunt force trauma, yeah. (sirens wailing) No, I just like to watch. It all looks so orderly from up here. So chaotic when you're down there. (soft music) - Okay. - See you in the morning? - Yeah. I'll be back for breakfast, get some sleep. - Yeah, have a good night. - You too. (slow piano music) * So you came * And watched me falling * Can't afford * The fall you showed me * Love of my life, love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life, love of my life * * Life * Baby you go * stowing in the night * And I love who we are * Where we go * Oh oh. Whole world waits. * Oh * Love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life, love of my * Love of my life, love of my life * * (In car) Love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life, love of my * Life * Love of my life. (garage door whirring) (garbage clattering) (punching in code) (recycling bin rumbling) (electricity humming) - [Alice] Fancy. Pine. Jones. Need. Ache. Want. - [Interviewee] It's easy for me to tell people that I love them. (laughing) - [Interviewee] Nope, I can't, it's really hard. - [Interviewee] Not many people wanna exchange those words. And so I've become a little bit uptight about it. - [Interviewee] It's not an easy thing to say, which I think is good. - [Interviewee] But there's a side of me that just wants to gush it out. - [Interviewee] For me, actions speak louder than words. - [Interviewee] I grew up in an atmosphere where nobody said I love you. - [Interviewee] My dad is good at showing that he loves us. But saying it has always been a bit of a challenge for him. - [Interviewee] I've only told a handful of people that. And every time I said it, it was difficult, but I meant it. - Yes, I do find it easy to tell people that I love them, although I never do. - It's hard for me to say it first. - 'Cause then you'll be the one that gets dumped. - But when other people say it, it's like yes! You said it first. - I don't wanna be put in that category where people use it randomly and flippantly. - I told my mom that I love her the other day. Out of the blue. - Sully's dad says I love you a lot to him. - And at one point you must have said, "I love you more." And I said, oh my God, I love you more. - I love you, Ma, and she said, "You know how important is that for me, thank you." - You hug each other a lot. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Because Daddy's warm. - Daddy's warm. (laughs) (mid-tempo music) - [Interviewee] When you tell someone you love them, it causes all sorts of reactions. Whatever your baggage around love is can be called up and you don't wanna feel it, or you might be really needy and wanna be loved, and so you grasp it. And once you feel open, you're feeling Life. And that's kind of scary to feel it in its largeness and how big it is. Most people don't really wanna feel all that stuff. (mid-tempo music) - [Kate] So, Eva. - Mm. - Do you love her? Or do you think it may just be lust? - I love who she is, like, she touches a part of me. Yeah, it's more than lust. But to be honest, right now I'm not... I'm in a bit of a complicated place, in like relationships in general. - I don't know if it's just lust, that seems to me like one of the cleanest things. It's like you can step in it and you can step right back out of it. It's like you can swim in it. You can get, you know, like, totally enraptured, and then leave. (James laughing) - I love you because you're such a troublemaker. - You know what? To be honest with you, I have a very high tolerance for mess. [Kate] And sometimes it's really worth it. - [Raymond] How's your mom doin'? - [Aidan] Oh, she's been keepin' the house surprisingly cleaner than usual. - [Raymond] And you're not givin' her too much grief? You're helping out? - [Aidan] Well recently she's been thinking about getting a pet. - Really? - A hamster or a gerbil. I thought she was allergic for a long time, but apparently she isn't. Oh, I wanted to tell you - you owe me 130 dollars. - [Raymond] Do you have that written down in your little book? - Yeah. - 'Cause I'm gonna need to see some proof. (sighs) Is it weird for you? Are you adjusting to me not livin' there? - [Aidan] Yeah, it's definitely weird, but I'm gettin' used to it, it's a lot cleaner. (keyboard clacking) - [Madison] How are you feeling? - [Alice] I'd rather talk about Charlie than how I feel. - No, we're not gonna talk about Charlie, - He's got a really nice bum. (Madison laughing) - What are you doing looking at my husband's bum? - Looks are free. - I better make sure I keep an eye on you next time he comes around. (laughing) so um, has anyone been coming to your website? - Mostly just Charlie. I wasn't making the website to find the perfect man, I just... I don't even know if I know what love is, you know? I wanted to find out, I wanted to feel it inside myself and sometimes I'm scared I don't even, I don't even know how to love. I'm so tired of being scared. - [Madison] There's nothing to be scared about. (sirens wailing) - [Charlie] The other night I was standing by the window. And I played it out in my head, I get the phone call, your wife's been struck by a streetcar. Why a streetcar, I don't know. I go to the hospital, I I.D. the body. And then I go home, and I'm here again. Only this time you're never coming back. I feel like I'm goin' crazy. I don't think it's good to be alone. I think we need more cats. (mid-tempo music) * Oh * Oh * Calling you, calling you home * - [Rod] He's always been like this, even when he was a kid. He's so stubborn! - [Steve] Do you know where these go? - No idea. I'm his executor, so I'm gonna be stuck with this mess. I really don't know why he won't just talk to me. Deal with it, say something, anything. - Well, he's a stubborn guy. (acoustic guitar music) (snow shovel rasping) * Ah - [Mum] Raymond, what are you doing? - [Raymond] Shovelin' the driveway. - I can do that. (mother tuts) (shovel clatters) (Raymond thuds on ground) (blinds rattle) (birds calling) (door latch clicks) (kids shout faintly) (bird calling) (Mum and Raymond chuckling) - It's 43,000 dollars for tuition alone. Mom's killing herself working to cover my living expenses. - Well, you're definitely scholarship material. - I don't know, I might just stay here. They've got a pretty good astrophysics program. - Or you can take a risk and go to the best research program in the world. - It's such a long shot though. - Well apparently there's 50 billion stars in our galaxy. It's a metaphor. - A metaphor. - Mm-hmm, look, there's endless possibilities, if you're open to them. - I wish; my universe? It's (chuckling) kinda just my mom and me. - This is actually great. I can argue with you and you don't talk back. This works for me. (chuckling) (reads) 'How many people have you had sex with?' How many people have YOU had sex with? See, I can only do this 'cause it's only the camera, 'cause if you were here I'd get hit right now. (Charlie click his tongue at cat) Well you see, there's more than one woman in my life. How did you know you were in love? Why are these in past tense? How did you know you WERE in love? I am in love; how do know I'm in love? I know I'm in love 'cause I'm sitting here talking to this camera. (Madison chuckles) When Alice first got diagnosed, I'm so glad you were there. And I'm not saying you should change, 'cause what you're doing is, I know. But you're kinda not here, like ever. And I don't like it. And I know you gotta be where you are right now but I just I just wish... I feel so... Your best friend has cancer. If you weren't there for her, you know... I get it, I just uh, I'm here too. (mid-tempo music) * I fill you up, this empty cup, I'll make you happy * * All that is hard - We gotta rush, Mommy's gotta get to work. * From my heart to make you happy * - [Alice] Why don't you just tell her the company's in trouble? Maybe this proposal will land a big contract. But what if it doesn't? * And oh, my love - [Katie] I got a surprise for you. * You are the road I take * And oh, my love - [Jax] Okay, so six weeks for the database development. - [Alice] I'll send you the tech specs. - We can't live without you, Alice. (chuckling) * I'll be the cure - Bye. * All that is pure - Bye. * I'll make you happy * And every day I'm on my knees * * Here to lie, here to please * And every day I'm overthrown * Here awhile. Gone tomorrow - [Madison] Hey. - Hey. Thanks Mads. - You hungry? - No. - [Madison] Okay. * On and on (Alice clears throat) - [Nora] I've written about 73 on cue cards, and I need your help with these. - Okay. - So I have devotion, crush. And I like this one a lot because you know when you're like really into someone and you have like a crush on them, and then they break up with you and you're crushed? Idolize, because I idolize you. - Aw. - I have appreciate, fond, fuck. - Fuck is a funny one. (chuckling) But I think it fits. - When I think of love, like loving a dude, I think of like you know sex and then everyone doesn't call it sex or making love anymore, they call it fucking, which I think is stupid. But then when you're done with them you're like, fuck, I shouldn't have done that, fuck! - That is a good one. - Air high five! (Nora laughing) - [Julia] Do sexy face. - Julia-- - Lemme show you. This is yours. Do a face. (Sam hisses) (both laughing) That's your face, that's scary. - Let's go out for dinner Saturday. - Really, no way, I don't think so. - I'm serious. - Now I'm sad. - It's just a dinner. At a restaurant. - I'm gonna miss you-- - Don't do that. - Don't sink the fuckship. - [Madison] I um, I want you to take a look at something. - What is it? - Take a look at it. - [Interviewee] Be yourself. Do not be what you think the other person wants you to be. - [Interviewee] It's not necessary to have a main person. You can have all sorts of kinds of love. You don't know how-- - What do you think? - To find it. - One of the most beautiful gifts to share with another person is to be open to everything that's going on in the moment. - What is this, Mads? - I thought you'd like it. - You always act like I'm some kind of screw-up. - It was really not that, I just... - [Alice] You were just so sure nobody would visit my website, huh? - I just wanted to do something for you. - [Interviewee] The only way to know love is to experience it, however difficult that is. - [Interviewee] And you have to be willing to be hurt, because you're gonna be hurt if you love somebody. - Really willing to get completely mashed. - Well we're humans so we make mistakes. - Yeah. - [Interviewee] It's inevitable. (soft music) (kids shouting faintly) (intergalactic whooshing) - [Keegan] We can actually see what happened 13.7 billion years ago through a telescope. - [Scott] The birth of the universe? - [Keegan] Yep, And since light travels at 9.6 trillion kilometers a year, the further away from Earth the telescope is looking, the earlier into the past it's actually seeing. - So I wonder who's 13.7 billion years in the future looking at us now. - [Keegan] Yeah, they'll be taking pictures of us 10 billion years after the end of the earth. - Thank you. - I can't believe you haven't read Vonnegut. - [Keegan] It's cold out! So cold. - So cold. - Think of it less like becoming a degenerate hophead and more like hunger therapy. (Alice chuckles) I always think of it as a saxophone almost, like you can lay down some sweet jams. - It kind of looks like a tympanic auger to release the evil from within your brain. (Alice imitates drill whirring) (bong whistles) - You gotta do a little Sleepy Hollow, I call it. (Steve exhales heavily) - [Alice] I got this. - Okay. - All right. (bong whistles) - I am totally picking up what you're laying down here. This is good, this is some sweet licks... (both laughing) - Oh, yeah. - Okay, down the hatch. (pizza crackling) - Mm, hmm. (laughing) - Baby steps, right? - This is good. (gentle guitar music) - [Interviewee] When I was a teenager I was much more attached to this kind of deep loneliness that I wanted to have soothed. (gentle music) I just had all these feelings of hurt and not being loved, and so I associated love with having those things fulfilled. * Ready - [Interviewee] As I've grown older and I've gone through a lot of different experiences with people, I no longer feel that it's related to needing to be loved by somebody else. * We are - [Carolyn] Any needs that I have aren't gonna be fixed by quote unquote love, because wanting someone to do that actually takes me out of love. (gentle guitar music) - Hello Wonderland, I'm making you a mix tape. Are you sitting down? Good, I want you to hold yourself in your mind's eye, like a vase. Not too tight that you might break it. And not too loose that it might fall. Gently. And repeat after me. May I be well, may I have peace of mind, may I be free of suffering, may I be filled with love, may I be happy. Now, in your mind's eye, picture someone you love. And repeat after me. May you be well, may you have peace of mind, may you be free of suffering, may you be filled with love, may you be happy. - [Alice] Appreciate. Engage. Delight. Amuse. Assist. - If an alien asked me how to describe love... - Do you want me to pretend you're the alien? - It would be a long answer. - First I'd ask them if they speak English. - I would explain to the alien, like, you know, this is just a biological drive. - It's the reason why people fight. - [Interviewee] I'd imagine maybe the alien would ask for access codes to Earth's defense systems. - They are aliens from a different planet. They know every word in the English language but love. You need to explain it to them. - Mm, hmm. - It's when for a brief moment you stop loving yourself more and you direct all that affection and interest and focus on - another alien. (Steve laughing) - Ah, looking good Wonderland. (gentle music) - [Interviewee] If there happened to be actual aliens out there, maybe they would be able to teach us a lot about love. And might have a much, much more sophisticated understanding and experience of love, and that would be amazing. (slow piano music) - [Madison] Yes, we can. - The RFP is a disaster. I'm just asking you to give the budget a reality check. - [Katie] Back. * Love of my - Okay, now your turn. * Love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life - You know I appreciate you. Okay, bye. (gentle music) (Alice speaks faintly) (Madison chuckling) - Stop saying things like that, you are normal... - You know... - I just don't feel normal. - [Katie] Huh? - Now let's see, eek. Gently. * Love of my - [May] Oh, sorry. * Love of my life (laughing) * Love of my life, love of my life * * Love of my life, love of my life, love of my life * (May and Katie imitating ducks) * Life (Katie giggles) (Katie laughing) - [Raymond] I'm walking around with a huge hole in my heart. Can you cauterize that? And I don't know who I am and I'm not sure what the hole is, - perfect, thanks. Or if it's a new me. It's hard for me to sort out. I'm a bit... a bit at sea right now. - You've got some baggage there. - You know, I'm, I'm separated from my wife. And uh I'm laying out there and I've, I've-- - I haven't said no yet. - I guess I was arming for no. Thank you. (Raymond sighs) Oh, God. (sirens wailing) - [James] 'Sexual passion is portrayed in myth as a force more powerful than any other. Capable of driving humans and gods alike into actions against their will, often ending in tragedy.' - 'Against their will'. (both laughing) (waves lapping) (birds twittering) - [Eva] So where...did you have fun last night? You know. - I was with Kate. - [Eva] I'm not trying to put you on the spot. I'm just wondering. - She's a friend. - I know. - We're just like, - [Eva] But you'd rather hang our with her than hang out with me? - I don't think you have to worry about her, necessarily. Or anyone particularly. - Men and women should be able to hang out without-- - They should-- - [James] People getting jealous. - Thinking, (chuckling) is that what it seems like? Am I...Am I being jealous? - Um-- - Am I being paranoid? - I'm not interested in messing with her life. (scoffs) Like that, or my life. - This just got really awkward. - [James] Hold on a second. - Okay. - I was wondering, um, do you wanna move in with me? (Eva laughing) - What? Yes! - You sure? (both laughing) - What is with you men? - Don't shoot me, just here to pick up my mail. - You're always trying to take a relationship and make it be what you want it to be. As opposed to just letting it be what it is. - Men are terrible. (Julia sighs) - I don't wanna get married, I just got divorced. No offense. - None taken. - Look at this. What do you think? - [Andrew] I think what you think is more important than what I think. - It's Sam's way of apologizing. - For what, exactly? - He asked me out for dinner. In a restaurant. - So now dinner is the gateway drug to marriage? (laughing) - Fine. Dinner. In a restaurant. (wine splashing) - [Andrew] Was that so bad? - [Julia] Yep. * Oh I love (singing faintly) * (Singing faintly) tremble down (singing faintly) * - You look amazing. - I dolled up a bit. (chuckling) * I'm gonna stay * For days and days, but I'm gonna do it anyways * * And I might lose control * But I won't go (singing faintly) (cutlery clinking) (patrons chattering) - You know what I'm thinking? - [Julia] (chuckling) You're thinking you're ready for a capital R relationship. - Yes. * No I'm not, no * Sometimes it takes - [Sam] But, it doesn't have to be with you. * I'm waiting on the side * And I like the view from the outside * * In the fallin' in rain * But I don't really mind, I don't really mind * - Cheque please. (laughing) - [Anne] Oh hey, how did it go with Sonja? - (laughing) Oh, man, I don't know. So I think that's probably bad, it was a little um awkward. - Oh dear. - How do you tell the difference between like a meaningful romantic stare and someone that's trying to communicate important information about a patient, you know? - [Anne] Well you're asking the wrong person there. I'll tell you that, but-- - You're not having any... - I'm not having any, no. - Success? - Just nothing. - Just nothing. - Are you even trying? - Online dating? - [Raymond] No, I don't come off well. - I'm not sure I'm good at that either. Cooking class or something. - Kayaking. - Yoga. - I think kayaking you would meet people. - I'm pretty shy. - Yeah. - Like I don't, I don't know that I can be myself. I don't know at first-- - There's a lot of red flags here, Anne. I feel like you're this close to spinsterhood. Do you like-- - I think you might be exaggerating there, but. - Let's be each other's wing man. We could be having fun, 'cause that's really attractive when people are having fun. And there'll be cultural events, so we would be laughing and enjoying each other's company. And then we would draw people to us. And have like a signal, yeah, like anything with the nose. - Yeah. (both laughing) - Like Dr. Phil says put yourself in a target-rich area. I don't know. - Does he say that? - [Raymond] He does. - [Scott] So like parallel universes. - [Keegan] Kind of more like the unified multiverse. - [Scott] So you're saying why is there something rather than nothing? - [Keegan] Well nothing's just the absence of something, right? So it kind of presupposes existence. - [Scott] You know what I mean. - The Big Bang just doesn't make any sense. - Right, it can't just make itself exist unless it's already there. - If there really is this big explosion that we're cooling down from, then, I mean, it wouldn't be a uniform temperature. There'd have to be some sort of heat exchange. The temperature in space is the same everywhere. All of space the same, 2.7 degrees above absolute zero. But why? - Well, that's what you're gonna figure out. - [Keegan] It's not just how things work in the universe that makes it so amazing. - Yeah, it's that it exists in the first place. - My theory is the multiverse loves us. It's just waiting for us to understand it and love it back. (insects chirring) (telephone ringing) - [Jax] I'm not prepared to discuss this here. - Here is the only place I see you awake. - That is not at all fair. - Do you guys need a referee? - We need a therapist. - [Jax] May thinks I'm a workaholic. - You are. - Therapists aren't supposed to take sides. I think you think that if you're not the perfect boss, or the perfect mom or have everything totally together, that the sky's gonna fall in. - The sky already fell in. (soft music) (piano music) - [Interviewee] Everybody's gonna die, right? So it puts everything in perspective. It's selfish when somebody dies and you miss them 'cause it's not saying, I'm sad you're not living, it's, I'm sad I don't have you around. - [Interviewee] Sometimes I say to myself I just can't die. I just can't die just yet, because little things like just making sure they brush their teeth every night. (laughing) Or you know, just that tenderness sometimes, just taking that extra breath. It's just the realization that I'm not gonna be around forever. (man speaks faintly on radio) - Yep. Yep, they're looking for a palliative bed right now. Okay. Yeah, we'll meet you there. Okay, bye. (man speaks faintly on radio) - [Interviewee] My mother has really been a pretty strong person in my life. When she died I was alone with her. And I was talking to her and for a long, long time, you know, I was trying to tell her how much I loved her. And then after about an hour of this, the doctor came up and said, "She's gone." And I didn't know that she was gone because, you know, I had been so wrapped up in just sharing things with her. It wasn't really sad because she lived such a full life. It was quite natural. - [Interviewee] When we really, really love someone and they're gone, it's... I mean they're gone. We find something else to distract us or find someone else to love and do we ever totally recover from that loss? Maybe, I don't know though. I think just things shift, life changes. - Nice bike. - Yeah, my baby brother left me his bike. I think he was hinting I should probably exercise a little more. - No. (guests exclaim) - Anyway, listen I just wanted to thank all of you for being there for Jude. The last few months were pretty brutal, as you know. And Jude wanted me to thank you too today. He said on Thursday that he didn't do a good enough job telling you, each of you, in person. He said, and I quote, "I totally sucked." - [Alice] You wanna get out of here? - [Rod] We all know Jude wasn't great at expressing his feelings. - Yeah. - But I know that he loved each of you in his own way. And I don't know what else to say, so drinks are on Jude. - Jude. - To Jude. - [Man] To Jude. (glasses clink) - [Mum] So what kinds of things have you been taking him to? - [Raymond] If you put together a list of cliched places where a father and son go, every movie involving any kind of action hero or anything marketed to boys-- (gong resounds) I think we've hit them all. Maybe the zoo we haven't done yet. - You would have such a good time there. - [Raymond] Do you wanna take him? - Yeah. - Okay. - I'd love to take him. - Okay. That would be perfect, he loves you. - I'm gonna take him to the Art Gallery. - He'd love that. - Do some sketching. Get those chairs and we'd sit there for as long as he wanted to draw that piece, and then we'd go find something else. - That's perfect, that'd be great. - That's what you need to do with Aidan, just be. Just be like I am with you. Just love him. (teacup rattles) So what is this new pirate role you have here? - I think it's actually more Shakespeare. (both laughing) (audience laughing) - My aunt got divorced and she started dating again. And I'm very, very proud of her. She's 50, She's met someone, he is 23 years old. (audience laughing) Yeah, I don't think they're gonna work out though, because she does not want any more children - and he is one. (audience laughing) Sometimes you can tell a marriage isn't gonna work out just by the two people's last names. When my grandparents got married his last name was Beaton. Hers was Payne, resulting in the Beaton-Payne wedding. They got divorced. (audience laughing) That's all I have. (audience applauding) (cell phone ringing) You missed the entire show. - Well, I honestly thought you were on later. - You said you'd come. You fuckin' promised it to me, what the fuck? - No I did not, I did not say that. - [Nora] I don't think you get it, I love you. But I'm so done with being the least important person in your life, so done. (rain and thunder) - [Jax] I know I can be difficult to get along with. - [May] You're my favorite pain in the ass. - I'm so afraid of failing. And that you're gonna figure it out, and that you're gonna leave me. - If our company tanks, it tanks; we can get day jobs. If our daughter's a complete disaster when she grows up and needs years of therapy to recover, that's life. - We better start a therapy savings fund right away. - You're my person. No matter what you do. - Are you still um-- - It's fine. Everything's fine, we don't need to go over it again. - Uh, yes, we do. You're clearly angry at me. - I'm not angry at you. You were angry at me, so now I feel hurt. And you accuse me of things that-- - Are true. (Eva scoffs) - Well, see, now we, here we go again. - [Interviewee] If my sister wasn't related to me (chuckling) we would be enemies of each other. But as much as we fight, there's just as much love. And it's so weird, 'cause there's no one who I would fight as much with and feel so much like anger with, but at the same time as much love. - [Interviewee] My sister and I are getting closer and I feel like all that hot Hell of our growing up years now is cooling off enough for us to maybe be able to see each other for who we are. Rather than for the big family mess. - I have a younger brother who is two years younger than me. We have a weird way of working through our fights. He'll get upset or I'll get upset. We'll walk away, we won't talk to each other for two or three days. But then we approach each other at the end of that time period, whenever the other person's ready. And we'll just go, listen, it was stupid, I'm sorry it's okay, it's fine, we just need our time apart. That's all it is, and I think yeah, I guess that's love. * Hey ho * Let it go (speaking faintly) * And on and on * We've gone * Ever easy * Ever rough * It's all it * Ever was * Oh whoa whoa whoa * Oh whoa whoa whoa * Calling you, calling you * Home * And all the fires that we take * * And all the twists and turns * And all the grace we gained * Bare to the bone * Faded on the page * We are not alone * It's the only thing I know (Keegan laughing) - Bow, kiss, fight. No, no. - [Charlie] Never sat in one of these. The bumps, every time, a bump-- - I'm sorry. - No, it's... - I can go slow. - No no no, that's okay. - [Alice] Here's a big bump coming up. - [Charlie] That's all right. - [Interviewee] The most important love for me right now is my friendships. I didn't grow up in a family where there was a lot of intimacy. It took a long time to figure out that I could have another kind of family. So for me that's the foundational love in my life. My friends. (heavy breathing) (smooching) - Thanks for the coffee. (laughing - [Interviewee] For me, love is really about trusting. Almost like blindly trusting, just like, if you're going to love, you just kind of hand everything over and let go of of everything really. - You're gonna be late for your dinner date. - [Interviewee] I still laugh because I was told, well you know, it's like putting a kettle with water on the stove. You begin with cold water, and as the relationship develops, it becomes warmer and warmer. And you know, you develop a deeper relationship. Whereas nowadays you young people start with really hot relationships. And, well, what can you go but cool down? - [Interviewee] The most important primary love for me is love with yourself, because you're the only person that's gonna be with yourself forever. If there's anything that should be worth working at, it's a relationship with yourself. And then everything comes from there. (soft music) (doorbell rings) - [Interviewee] My love for my son is actually something I would like to have for the world. To accept it in all its pain and confusion and ugliness. (May and Katie speaking faintly) - Oh no! - It's a gift to love somebody that way, I know that. - [Jax] What did you get us for breakfast? - [Katie] Two cupcakes and one banana. - [Eva] Hi Kara. Cool bike. - [Kara] I know. - [Interviewee] Families are changing and love is changing. There's a lot less boundaries and a lot less expectations for particular kinds of love. - [Nick] Hey! - [Interviewee] And I think that's great. It's like an evolution of the experience of love. - Hey kiddo. - Hi, Dad. - You ready to go? - I am so ready to go. - That's it? - That's it. - [Eva] So there's nothing in the basement or? - [Nick] For sure. - [Kara] Dad, I thought we were going cycling. - I just came to get my things. - Yeah, can we go for a drink some time? - I'll think about it. - I don't think too many people live entirely without love. Everybody has friends, or a cat. (soft music) - [Interviewee] If you don't have love in your life, - Good to see you pal. - It's like a piece of you is missing. - [Raymond] What do you say about a little pizza tonight? - [Aidan] Are you ordering it or making it? - [Raymond] Hey I think I better, I better order it. - [Aidan] That's a relief 'cause last time you made it that was horrible, you burnt everything. - [Raymond] I even burnt my hand. - [Aidan] Dude, that was like a third degree burn. * We're lying here (knocking at door) - [Madison] Alice? You ready to go? - [Interviewee] I think it's like gravity. We feel gravity, we experience it in our lives. But gravity exists separately from us. If there were no humans there would still be gravity. Love, we experience as this amazing powerful thing. Is it this thing that exists separately from us and we happen to be fortunate enough to experience it? To me, that feels more true. But I just don't think we're anywhere close to having it figured out. - [Alice] My life was so full of love. And I blinked and I missed it. - [Madison] You're not dead yet. (soft music) - [Interviewee] I'll spend my whole life trying to figure it out, but I think that's what a lot of people tell themselves. Once I get it right, I'll be happy. * Ooh * We are * Oh * Who * We are * Oh (soft music) - [Interviewees] Joy. - Commitment. - Enjoying someone. I'm not sure if that's proper grammar. Sounds kinda strange to me. - The only thing that came to my mind is amour. (laughing) - To me that's like asking, are there other words for hockey? Like why, why do we need other words? I mean, hockey is a pretty good word. - Respect. - Fun, F-U-N. - Kindness, humor, tolerance. I think the big one is tolerance. - Terror (laughing), love is terrifying. - When I think of how I love you, it's just pure acceptance of everything about you. - Well there's bliss and happiness. But they're all trite. - Smaller I guess, parts of love. Affection and adoration and endearment. - The Greeks had four words for love, agape. - To like something, to be crazy about somebody to feel devotion to somebody. - There was Eros, which is the romantic. - I feel like a thesaurus when I say those things. - Philia, which is family love. - There's many ways that we communicate outside of words, it's expressed non-verbally a lot. - Work, that's the main one I think, work. - Love-hate with a hyphen. - Yeah, just using a descriptor plus the word itself. - The Buddhist's four immeasurables, I think, are all kind of in there somewhere. - Unconditional for sure, selflessness. Universality. - Equanimity, compassion, loving kindness and joy. - Infatuation, desire, empathy. - Justice. How can you truly love without wanting justice for the other person? Whatever form that justice takes. - There are so many different words in Spanish to say so many different kinds of love. - Deseo. Which is desire. - Carere. Amare. - Respeto. Confianza. We would trust. - Fantastic, spectacular. That's all the words I know. - I don't think that there could be an adequate synonym for the word love. - I can't think of a single one that comes anywhere near as all-encompassing as that word, love. - I think that's it.
