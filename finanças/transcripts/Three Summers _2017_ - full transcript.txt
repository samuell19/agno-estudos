This film contains some strong language GENTLE COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS You're listening to your very own Nyungar Boodjar Regional Radio, raising the bar in community-funded local broadcasting. Regular listeners won't need reminding that "boodjar" means "country", and we respectfully acknowledge the Nyungar people - traditional owners of this beautiful land - and pay our respects to their elders, past and present. And what is it I always say at this point, friends? That's right. Another year, another Westival. Has it really been a year? How did that happen? As John Lennon said, "Life is what happens while you're making other plans." And were the great man alive today, he might very well say, "Hey, Yoko, "let's make plans to visit the Gladstone Heritage Village in Noongar Boodjar "for the 16th wonderful Westival, "Western Australia's premiere, rurally-based community folk event." It's a camping holiday, but with folk music. What's not to love? # Follow # Follow the sun # Which way the wind blows # When this day is done. # Another fabulous Westival! Or some other word starting with F. Sir? Only headline artists on site, sir. That is blue-tagged vehicle. You are tagged green for camping. I need you to exit the area immediately. I have to have power to rehearse. I've got permission. Open the back of the vehicle, sir. OK, I've got the tags and passes, wristbands, also keys. Don't lose them. Yep. So they put us in the same rooms. I'm in Woody Guthrie and you guys are sharing Dolly Parton. If only. SCATTERED LAUGHTER Gets funnier every year, guys. Sir, I do not see an instrument. No, you're right. It's actually a mobile bomb factory. Wrong decision! HE SCREAMS IN PAIN It was a joke! It was a joke! It's a musical instrument. It's a theremin. A lot of people think Brian Wilson used one on Good Vibrations, but that was a tannerin. Sir, security is never a laughing matter. You have had your first and your last warning. Do not disappoint me. DISTANT LAUGHTER AND CHATTER Hey. Hey. Just settling in, Da. So I'll see you in the bar? You read my mind, love. Not a very long book. Gramps, we got our usual place. Brilliant. Same as every year. Ruby, darling, can you keep it down, please? I need to finish this call. No, I can't come back. This weekend is sacrosanct mother-daughter time. But I will be on my tablet, so I'll be checking e-mails and reading texts. Hi. Not quite the same this year, Rubes. No, Grandad, of course not. But Grandma would want you to still have a good time. So you have to. For her. Nobody played accordion like your gran. Good to go, Neilo! Good to go, Glenys! Let's go. Back it nice and slow. Cone, Glenys! OK. Steady, steady, steady, cone, Glenys! Steady, steady, steady, steady back, back, back, back, back, all right! Lock and load! Great parking, Neilo. Well done, Glenys. Nice cone work. You're still listening to Festival Folk and, with us this morning, the very lovely Diamond, a top little singer from Mandjoogoordap and an old friend of Nyungar Boodjar Regional radio. We're going to be chewing over all things Westival for the next half hour or so but, first up, would you give us a song, Diamond? I certainly would, Queenie. That would be awesome. I'd like to play for you an alternative take on a much-loved Aussie folk song which I think better reflects the sexual politics of post-invasion Australia. It's called Raping Matilda. Please don't sing along. # Once a jolly sexist Conforming to his gender role # Within a colonial patriarchy # And he sang as he sat Just another white supremacist # Who'll come invading Australia with me? # We're Feminasty, we own this town # We're driving to the festival Nobody gonna stop us all # Driving in a hot pink car Word! # Don't be fricken with my bizzle # We're Feminasty shizzle Go Courtney in the back And Indi on my side. # # And her ghost may be heard # As she dances around the billabong # Who'll come castrating the swagman with me? # No tax on tampons. Thank you. You've been amazing. No, thank you, Diamond, for a very thought-provoking and contemporary take on a tale of early Australian wanderers and perhaps the appropriate moment to reflect on the fact that our very own Gladstone Heritage Village was once home to many homeless little wanderers. That is so true, Queenie. Poor, ravaged and rickety Pommy mites sent here under the UK Child Migration Scheme. Nearly 65 years since I first stood on those steps. I know, Grandad. Funny. We didn't even want to come here. Now everybody does. Well, I couldn't find anyone playing the rubab, but there are a number of mandolin recitals. Which is similar to the rubab, although of course with 12 less strings. HE CLEARS THROAT I wonder if we should be pushing for a response. I'm not pushing. I'm trying to connect. Members of Westival's Recovering Alcoholic Community, your meeting's venue has been moved to the place they used to have the bar. Bob and Sharon in the Festival office clearly have a sense of irony. Don't you love it? DOOR OPENS Delivery. Four cases of beer. Who wants it? Steady, people. Steady. See this as a challenge. So, Diamond, do you have any personal must-sees that you've picked out from the Festival brochure? Well, Queenie, I love anything that challenges form, so today I'm super excited to check out the theremin revolution. Mm! Which you Westival folk can find down at the small workshop hut. Yes! Thank you, Queenie. And, of course, the theremin was the instrument that Brian Wilson used to get the weird woo-woo sound... ..in Good Vibrations. Oh, my God, bitches! I just got a 99.9 Atar. I'm school Dux. Damn, girl, that's amazing! Isn't it? I...I mean, not that I give a... ..swag. It's all bullshit. Obvs, Courtney. What up? What is up? I'm Dexter. Got some quinoa falafel or small batch, slow-brewed, steam-filtered bottle-conditioned organic sarsaparilla. And you're on Tinder. Ah, excellent. Later? Maybe. Quinoa falafel and an overcomplicated sarsaparilla, please. Totally. Ain't no thing. My annual protest to demand the closure of the Gladstone asylum seeker detention camp. This is actually very important. No, so I need the ceramics checked and shipped by close of business. Asylum seekers. Detention camps. If we'd have just left them on their boats, we wouldn't need to lock 'em up. Gramps, they're refugees. We have a UN obligation. Refugees? Pull the other one! They just want to come and live here. Well, what if they do? You were an immigrant once. I was seven years old and I wasn't given a choice. And I was put straight to work. I had to earn my bit of Australia. I didn't just turn up and demand it. THEREMIN MUSIC PLAYS MUSIC STOPS So... ..welcome to the theremin revolution. Both in the room and streaming to the International Theremin Community worldwide. Hiya, Adalbert. It's pretty late in Norway, so thanks for checking in. Cos this revolution is all about what I call techno folk funk. What drum'n'bass and hip-hop were to Generations X and Y, I believe that techno folk funk will be to Generation... Well, whatever the next letter is. It could be Z. Settled in for the full session, have we, Eamon? Trawling for business, are you? We don't trawl. People have to come of their own accord. Oh, don't be so coy, Pam. You know you're itching to get me into your joyless little losers' club. Well, I think you may have a problem. Well, you see, Pam, if you take a teaspoonful of sherry of an evening and it causes you to beat your wife, then it's a problem. You follow me? It's complex, but I'm with you so far. But on the other hand, if you drink all day, every day, but you do your work, you pay your tax, and you love your daughter, then you don't have a problem. You have a... ..a habit. And I...I'm a creature of habit. Well, leave you with your mate. THEREMIN MUSIC IN DISTANCE MUSIC STOPS Just to dispel a couple of popular theremin myths. The instrument that Brian Wilson used on Good Vibrations is a tannerin. The theremin's pitch is controlled by a single vertical oscillator. Sorry to state the obvious. MILD LAUGHTER How do you, like, compose on a theremin? I don't think you do compose on the theremin. You sculpt music. Sick image. So sick. The air is my clay. SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER SHE CLEARS THROAT Hay fever. SHE SLURPS Man, this is crap! They only booked us so they can tick off the diversity boxes. You're getting paid, and you're keeping out of trouble. What's your problem? Jumping round in a nappy for a mob of white fellas. That's fucking what! 20! Jessie did another 20! 17 rhymes with clucks and three rhymes with hunts. That's a dollar in the lolly fund. Gidday, folks! Name's Jack. Welcome to my country. That's a lot of cables. Lot of dials. Not organic enough for you? Well, let's just say it's not what you normally find at a folk workshop. Yes, of course, we want wood and bone and gut, don't we? We want... ..bits of animal skin stretched over hand-turned hazelnut. We want things that we can touch and strum and blow. That's what you're thinking, isn't it? No, certainly not. I don't judge people. Even people who seem absolutely determined to be judged. OK. I actually liked what you did. Really? You liked my music? Well, I liked your passion. Your commitment. But did you like the music? I'd buy a CD. A CD? What century is this? Well, I can put it on a USB and you can stick that in your computer. I don't have a computer. I have a phone. I mean, maybe you could give me your e-mail and I'll send you a link? OK. So who do you play your theremin with? Are you in any bands? No, I play alone to tracks I make myself. And how do you avoid disappearing up your own arse? I don't. I quite like it there. Maybe one day the world will join me. What kind of tracks do you make? I like, uh... ..found sounds. Finding music in stuff where there isn't music. A creaking door. A dripping tap. I once captured a cane toad fart. In a bottle? On an iPhone. I know. Well, it sounds like a real crowd pleaser. I'm not interested in pleasing crowds. In which case, you have picked the right instrument. It was nice chatting. My gig is...is here at 4.30, you know, just if you were interested. Maybe. OK, bye. Bye. Anyone can drum! Try this! And this. Put it together, what do you get? You see? Now you're all drummers. It's that simple! Come on, tighten it up. That's it. Good, good, good, good. Bob, look like you mean it. OK, lads, hold up. Ah, can I have a word, Henry? Mm-hm. Look, I'm no Muriel, but I am doing my best to sit in with Rodney. Muriel always considered you a very fine player, Gwyn. I was thinking that we should maybe do some fundraising for cancer research in her honour. Yes. What about doing a nude calendar? You know, with bells and flowers over all our bits. What do you think? I think she'd prefer a cake stall, Gwyn. Why do I have to be on the end of the line, Henry? Somebody's got to be at the end of the line, Bob. It's the nature of a line that there's somebody on the end of it. Yeah, but I've...I've got no-one to click my stick against. I'm just waving it around. Makes me look silly. The fact that there's nobody at the end of the line to click your stick against is a problem that's bedevilled the Morris dancing community for hundreds of years. Couldn't we just dance in a circle? We dance in a circle when tradition dictates, and only when tradition dictates. We could change it up a bit. Like doing a nude calendar. We are not doing a nude calendar, Gwyn! You can't change traditions. It's...it's a contradiction in terms. All right, lads, one more time, with music. FOLK MUSIC PLAYS Well, here we all are again. Yeah, here we are again. Lovely. Yeah, lovely. Cheers. Cheers. Another botski? Oh, why not? Good idea. Lovely. THEREMIN MUSIC PLAYS SCATTERED APPLAUSE That was my take on Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana. SHE LAUGHS Excuse me, that's funny? Just...I didn't recognise a single note, that's all. Well, if it sounded the same, there wouldn't be much point in my reinterpreting it now, would there? OK. Do you jam? Do I jam? Yeah. Brought my fiddle. Well, this is a recital. It's not a party. You start. I'll come in on top. Well, these people have come to hear the theremin, am I wrong? Actually, I think adding a fiddle might be really special in a random sense. Have you got anything a little less funky, a little more folky in your box of loopy tricks? OK. Let's see here. FOLK MUSIC PLAYS Yeah, that's good. THEREMIN-FIDDLE BATTLE SHE GASPS How was it for you? It...it was pretty good. There's only 14 people in the audience, but there's over 40,000 years of history on the stage. Fuck this show! Listen here, Jessie. I stuck my neck out for you. The only reason you're not in detention right now is because I told Juvie you were a dancer. So you will be a dancer. Oh, we really played up a storm, didn't we? I've never blown up an amplifier before. Well, that's cos you've never played with me. Did...did you get the music I e-mailed? Oh, no. I'm sorry, I don't really check e-mail. I'm more of a Facebook girl. We just use e-mail for bookings and stuff. My dad does that. I'll get him to dig it out. And I'm Keevey, by the way. Roland. Hi. Keevey, that's a... that's a nice name. Thanks, yeah. I'm Irish, like you. Real Irish, or been living in Australia for seven generations and still claiming to be Irish? Is it important? I think it is. I think we live in an increasingly globalised, homogenised society into which every culture is dissolving. Right. But instead of meeting that challenge and creating new social paradigms, people claim spurious ethnic credibility, courtesy of Google family trees. Wow, OK. "Oh, my great-grandmother's from Tipperary "and that makes me a feisty rebel with the soul of a poet." How about being a rebel? How about writing a poem? Both my parents were born in County Cork. Is that good enough for you? Yes, that's OK. One degree of separation is legitimate. They had a right to call you Keevey. Phew! Thank you, that's so generous of you! You need to chill. I don't want to chill. Chilling is a post-modern word for apathy and indolence. Seriously? Definitely seriously. You have to maintain your rage. Johnny Rotten said, "Anger is an energy." Well, so is glucose, but you can have too much of it. Excuse me, I think I have the room booked now. Oh, uh... Not to be heavy. No, no, I... Let me put my equipment in the corner and I'll be out of your hair. Then coffee? Yes. Two seconds. So, Jack, can you tell us a little bit about the dance you're going to do? Well, I'd like to, Queenie, but I can't. Because, you see, I'm Aboriginal and therefore not actually here. I think I know where you're going with this, Jack. Is this Terra Nullius? When those white fellas first turned up, they said the land was empty, that all those black fellas they were shooting didn't actually exist. So, if you weren't here then, then you can't be here now. That's right, Queenie. But I'm joking, of course. I am here, and you're here because Australia was never empty. Your mob invaded it and, since no treaty was ever signed, Australia remains an occupied country. Fair cop, Jack. Now let's enjoy the wonderful Westival sights and sounds and shapes of Dancing Dream. Occupied country, my arse! I bloody helped build this country! TRIBAL DRUMMING Don't look so glum! Come and have a drum! In the sun, it's fun, fun, fun! Yeah, yeah, banging is not drumming. Yes, it is. What's this? Well, in the absence of fills, flams, ghosts, polyrhythm, paradiddle, quarter notes, rolls, shuffles, triplets, quads, backbeat, drags, descendos, bembe and bossa nova... ..I'd say it was just banging. And it's fun! For you, maybe. Not for us. Oh, God! Ukuleles! You don't like ukuleles? I love ukuleles. It's the people playing them that I can't stand. What? The ukulele isn't an instrument any more. It's a lifestyle. It's a low-tech dating app for middle-aged divorcees. How can you be so judgmental of other people's musical choices? Well, music is my life. Your living? No, my living is a small dog-washing business but, if it helps, I was the youngest ever member of the Irish Youth Orchestra. On the theremin? I played a few other things. Like? Mandolin, harpsichord, guitar, double bass, piccolo and bassoon. And you chose the theremin? Eventually. I just wasn't good enough at the others. I came to accept that I'm not a true artist, just a gifted technician. So I challenged myself to the world's most technical instrument. Sounds to me like you just chose an instrument that so few people play, you could have a good shot at being the best at it. No, I've given up trying to be best, but I know it when I see it. And I see it in you. Who's the handsome fella Keevey's with? Do you know him? No, she loves 'em and leaves 'em, just like her dad. I suppose she saw what a big mistake her mum made, settling for an arsehole like you, and she doesn't want to repeat it. That may be it. The women in my family always had the brains. Oh Jesus, Eamon, can't you even drink your coffee straight? I could, my darling, but I do not choose to. Where did you train? Didn't. Music's just in the family. Your parents play? Dad does. Mum did. Sorry, don't buy that. Music isn't something you choose. If you can just drop it, you never had it. She died. Ah. That old excuse. Car crash. Hit a tree. I was 16. Well, if there is a heaven, which I'm afraid there definitely isn't, I imagine she's pretty proud. I don't think she'd really care that much. She dumped me anyway. Dumped you? Left. Dad came home pissed one too many times and she shot through. So in fact she dumped him. Put it this way. I wasn't enough to make her stay. Rolly, mate! Hey, Jack! Didn't expect to see YOU at Westival. Too many actual tunes for you, I'd have thought. HE LAUGHS This bloke plays the dumbest instrument in Australia, and that's coming from a fella who plays a hollow stick. HE LAUGHS This is Jessie. He plays a bit of guitar. I told him you might show him a few shapes. Not interested. If I dock his money, he'll be interested. Roland's an amazing fella. Any talent a kid's got, he'll find it and work with it. Jack does a midnight jam for kids in Freo who are out on the streets. That's very cool. So, how about it? Will you give him a go? Well, sorry, Jack, I'd like to help, but you can't teach a reluctant student. They have to want to learn. Come on, you two. Bye. You know, I like that song you were playing. Impressions of Nirvana? I kind of liked the not remotely like Nirvana. But, no, it was the other one. You were playing it in your workshop. It was...it was pretty. It was like a siren voice. Oh, just the freeform. Extemporising. Yeah, that was sculpted and then forgotten. Not by me. FIDDLE PLAYS That's incredible. I can't believe you remembered it. Yeah, well, I liked it. It drew me in. It's why I call it Siren Voice. Well, that's all from me for another day and, uh, I'll be at the WArrikins gig later. And for my younger listeners, a band called Feminasty will be playing right here in the chapel, and they tell me they intend to really kick some bottom. So, uh, that sounds like fun. This is Queenie, wishing you all a folking good night. It's a joke. Please don't write in. Nice digs. You think? Well, I'm sleeping in my microvan. It's a bit of a squeeze. Room enough for one, if you sleep at an angle. No Mrs Theremin, then? No genius techy girl geek blowing your fuse? Being a musician is not great for relationships. Oh, tell me about it! I'm never anywhere for more than a couple of days. I've been trying Tinder, but, really, to be honest, I'm kind of over it. Tinder? Mm-hm. Wow! Really? Yeah. People always think it's weird when girls are on it, but plenty are, otherwise it wouldn't work, would it? And it would be Grindr. It does get lonely on the road sometimes. Mm. But anything truly worthwhile requires sacrifice. Music can't be a part-time thing, particularly for someone like you. I just play the fiddle. It's no big deal. You don't just play the fiddle, Keevey, really, you don't. You...you inhabit it. You have a special gift. Bet you say that to all the violinists. No. Just you. Oh, wow, that was really, really nice. Thank you. It's not very cool to thank a girl for a kiss, Roland. It's a little weird. Oh, sorry. Of course, it's just, you know, it's been a while. I like your hands. They're really soft. Well, I shampoo dogs for a living and play a non-contact instrument. You're not going to build up a lot of callouses. Maybe you should play a contact instrument sometime. Tea? Yes, please. It'll have to be herbal. I don't have any milk. I love herbal. Keevey? You need to make a plan. What sort of a plan? A music plan to raise your game and match your potential. A gift like yours isn't going to find that kind of stimulus playing crappy little festivals like the Westival. It's a great little festival. It's too safe. It's too comfortable. What's the point of a festival if it doesn't push the boundaries, invert forms? Instead, they book idiot drummers with pirate hats and dinosaur pub rock bands, like the West Australian Rikins. I think they pronounce it the WArrikins. It's a play on larrikin. The West Australian Larrikins. Oh, I didn't get that. Have you ever seen them play? I don't need to. I've read the programme. "A grand bit of Irish craic." If you've never seen an act, then how can you know anything about them? I've never seen the Earth's core, but I know that it's approximately 90% iron and nickel, and I know that the West Australian Rikins are at least 90% shit. And you, Roland, are 100% arsehole. Sorry? Which is a shame, because you have really nice hands. Now, I need to get ready for a gig and you need to go. But what about the herbal... The tea is cancelled. Door is that way. Unless maybe you want to... ..buy a poster or a CD? 18 bucks. Fuck! INDISTINCT CHATTER Hey, hey, great festival, eh? It's great, isn't it? Hey, buddy. Pretentious twat! We're off to see a show, Jafaar. You should come. Honest, the WArrikins are brilliant. Who's pushing now? No? OK, no worries. What are you writing? Letter? Don't interrogate him! I'm not interrogating him, I'm talking to him. Well, it sounds like interrogating. Name's Henry, son. That's Ruby. Adopted? Gramps! What? He's obviously not related. He's a completely different colour. Gramps! Fostered? Yeah, I was kind of fostered myself. Not to a family, to a farm school. They told him he was an orphan, but he wasn't. Doesn't make a great deal of difference, Rube. Well, the Prime Minister apologised. Not at the time, obviously. Chin up, son. No point in looking back. Got to get on with it. Gramps! What? FIDDLE PLAYS, AUDIENCE CHEERS # As I was going over # The Cork and Kerry mountains # I saw Captain Farrell And the money he was counting # I first produced my pistol # Then I produced my rapier # I said stand and deliver Or the devil, he may take ya # Musha ring dum a doo dum a da # Whack for my Daddy-o # Whack for my Daddy-o # There's whisky in the jar # Some men, they like fishin'... # In your dreams.

Your carer's signature will need to be witnessed by a non-family member for whom photo ID is also required. Although a photocopy is permissible, if witnessed. I just wanted to go inside and get a drink of water so I don't dehydrate while I'm dan... Oh, be-de-de-de-de-de, do not make me take you down! I'll just go. Oh, absolutely delicious, girls! Same every year. First night... I do mains. And I do sweets. Second night... I do sweets. And I do mains. Nasty lasty! Or nasty nexty, I suggest. The night is still young! Same every year. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Hi. Thank you. Enjoy, guys. Thanks for coming. Bye. Well. Look who came to see the West Australian Rikins, then. I didn't know it was your band. Mm. Well, now you do. So were we at least 90% shit, as presumed? Look, I'm not going to pretend that pub rock is my scene. It is not pub rock! It's folk rock. Folk rock is pub rock. The punters love it. Punters loved Hitler. Wow! That...that is a big leap. Well, I'm here to sell CDs. Do you want to buy a CD? Yes. Yes, I would. No, actually, you can't have one because you don't even like our music. So I suppose you're loitering around to have another shot at me, for which, incidentally, you can wait until, I don't know, the end of time. Goodbye, Roland. Keevey, let me just put your music on the Net. We don't want our music on the Net. The WArrikins are a live band. Live is what we do. I wasn't talking about the WArrikins, just you. There is no just me, Roland. So you're happy playing covers in a pub folk rock... ..pub folk band? Oh, no, I'd much rather be a multi-instrumental genius dog-washer. This isn't about me, Keevey. I think it is. I think it is all about you. You are an inspired player. I'm just a technically competent one. Have you heard of the Academie Conservatoire? Of course I've heard of the Academie Conservatoire. I saw Peter And The Wolf there when I was five. They do a one-year creative composition programme. I was on it, but I dropped out. Roland, I have absolutely no qualifications. It's entrance by audition. And the Academie's going to pick me, a mature age step-dancing fiddle player, over a bunch of classically trained 18-year-old private school kids? They might. Their whole thing is searching out the exception. Coming to the bar, Keevey? Yeah, I will. Da, this is Roland. He's a theremin player. Yes, it's an electronic instrument... I know what a fuckin' theremin is, son. Brian Wilson used one on Good Vibrations. I'll see you there, Da. Look, you seem to think I need some kind of directing but, if you ask me, you're the one who's lost. I'm not lost because I'm not going anywhere. You are, and you're wasted in the WArrikins. Roland, I make my living in a band. I took over from my mum when I was 16 years old. How am I supposed to just restart my life now, even if I wanted to? By... ..expanding your horizons. By having a horizon, not just inheriting your mother's. Nice. ALL: We will never give up. We will never give in. We will stick together. Feminasty forever! # I stole some Jack and smoked some crack # To go down with my food # And when I get there Well, you'd better beware # Cos I'm in a real good mood! # Hey, bro, you got a problem? I didn't, but I do now. OK, bro, just chill. I'm not your bro, white boy. All my bros are in detention. Hey, it's Jessie, isn't it? And Kalti? I'm Ruby. We're camped in your area. You're all camped in our area, girl. This is Nyungar land. Don't beat yourself up, son. You're not the first fella to lose his heart to Keevey. She's too good for your band. Much too good. Too good for the WArrikins? Yes. She's a truly gifted musician, and a composer too, if her improvs are anything to go by. And you're a party band for middle-aged pissheads. You think you're the first person to notice that, do you? Maybe the first person to say it. I'm her dad. I know how bloody good she is. Even better than her ma, and that's saying something. Well, then, why don't you tell her? Don't insult me, son. I'm not a fella it's clever to insult. OK, bye. I have told her. Every Westival, I say to myself, if Keevey's back here with you next time, you've failed. She's got to leave the WArrikins. Get away from her drunken old da. But until she decides that for herself, there's nothing any of us can do about it. PHONE CHIMES Excellent! You should have come, Jafaar. It was absolutely brilliant. Well, we'll... We'll leave you to it, mate. OWL HOOTS Oh, awesome! Mm. Mm, totally. We were awesome. That was some good sex right there, lady, am I right? Dexter, you know you can't sleep here, right? Why not, sweet lips? What up is that you have to go now. Like, go for real? Sort of, yeah. So it's just wham, bam, thank you, Dexter? Well, you know, it's a tiny bed. I have a headline show tomorrow. You probably snore. I definitely snore. You know, it's for the best. Yeah, yeah, totally. Cool. It's not a thing. Um, it's fine. I'm busy. Heaps of things to do. So, yeah, it's all good. Want to hook up tomorrow? Rise and shine, all you wonderful Westifolks! Our wonderful Westival is over for another year. And remember, the Westival doesn't happen once a year. The year happens once a Westival! KNOCK ON DOOR Better get a move on, love. Kalgoorlie tonight, eight o'clock. Back on the road again, huh? Yeeha! SHE WHISTLES Gidday, little fella. What's up? Young lady, are you stamping? No, I'm wearing step shoes. Sometimes, I like to tap when I play. Saves money on a drummer, you know? This is an acoustically sprung, Tasmanian oak concert floor. Please do not tap dance. Right, sorry, I won't. Now, we do not appear to have your Curriculum Vitae on file. You were asked to supply one. Yeah, I brought it with me. I can... The Conservatoire is earth-friendly. We're striving for a paper-free environment. Kindly scan it and e-mail it. I don't have a scanner. Or a computer. I live mainly on the road, out of a trailer. My dad has a laptop we use for band stuff. Maybe I could type it out and... I presume this means that you'll also be working from paper sheets? Sheets? Sheet music. What do you intend to play from? I wasn't going to play from anything. I was going to improvise. I see. I thought all of your candidates would be able to read music, so maybe you'd want... ..I don't know, a bit extra. A bit extra what? Just a bit extra. Well, then, Keevey... ..perhaps you could give us your chosen recital. Plus a bit extra. OK. SHE CLEARS THROAT This is my take on a lovely piece called The Mountains Of Mourne. SHE CLEARS THROAT MUSIC: THE MOUNTAINS OF MOURNE HAIRDRYER BLOWS BARKS BARKS Oh, yeah! FIDDLE MUSIC SLOWS Thank you, uh, Keevey. You may go. Another year, another Westival. Come rain, come shine, you can't stop us Westifolk getting properly folked up. OK, same rooms, new names. I'm in Kris Kristofferson and you guys are sharing the Dixie Chicks. Ooh, things are looking up! SHE GROANS And all the way from Mandjoogoordap, Diamond is with us again. Yay! And what little gem do you have in mind for us today, Diamond? Well, Queenie, I'd like to offer you a contemporary take on the famous Aussie Laughing Kookaburra song. Oh, and what Aussie doesn't love that one? They may love the song, Queenie, but not the kookaburra as, due to deforestation, there aren't any old gum trees left for them to sit in. # Kookaburra stuffed in a glass display case # Habitat destroyed by the human race # Cry, kookaburra, cry # Kookaburra, soon you'll be extinct. # SILENT MURMURS FROM AUDIENCE Good to go, Glenys. Good to go, Neilo. Let's make it happen. Back it in. Cone one, let's go. Nice and slow, Neilo. Nice and slow. Cone two, Glenys, cone two. That's nice. Back it in, back it in. Nice and steady as she goes. Cone three, Glenys. That's it. Hold it there. Lock and load. Well, an exciting weekend ahead, I think. Don't you, Jafaar? Yes, Barbara. Very exciting. Bitch didn't have it. If you want to make it, you've got to own it. A bitch just can't give up and go to uni. Feminasty pledge. BOTH: We will never give up. We will never give in. We will stick together. Feminasty forever. Check it out. Wow! That is so cool! Jessie, that's nothing to be proud of, mate. Ain't it? I am chatting with our very own Westival success story. Roland, every dog has its own bark. What is it about this specific bark? Just a quality, Queenie, a timbre. I'd been shampooing a Schnauzer, massaging in the conditioner, when she gave this little modulated staccato yelp, and I just thought, "Oh, yeah." You'd found a sound? Well, my view is, Queenie, that you don't really find a sound. It finds you. I caught that yelp on my iPhone, sampled it onto a theremin lick and put it on my site and, next thing I know, everything has gone all kinds of crazy. American rapper Koolaz was using your sample? Exactly. He'd been searching the Net, looking for special interest sites, as you do. He typed in "yelping bitches" and by lucky chance... He found your Schnauzer. He sampled my thero-schnau mashup onto his latest urban gangsta rap. My Bitch Be A Dog? That's right, Queenie. My Bitch Be A Dog. SCATTERED APPLAUSE Have you been coining millions? EMBARRASSED LAUGHTER Not quite millions, but I do get a healthy 0.0002% of each download. Which comes to? About 800 so far. Well, it's not too bad for a random bark. Yeah. Although, after taking legal advice, I have agreed to split the money 50-50 with Mrs Boo-Boo. But it's great to be back here at the Westival. That shitty little festival? I'm really looking forward to seeing Umid. The traditional folk group from Afghanistan? Yes, yes. It's great to see the Westival pushing boundaries as opposed to taking the usual easy, populist options. Shut up! I also love the way that the Westival makes really good folk music so exciting and accessible. I think the WArrikins are the best example of that. Oh, we all love the WArrikins. I used to be a little dismissive of folk rock myself, but it's through bands like the WArrikins that I've really come to see its value. THUNDER RUMBLES Ruby, darling, there's a storm coming in. I need to check these messages. Can you please come out here and help me with this... Fuck you, Mum! You're a complete bitch and I hate this shitty festival. Excuse me! No, no, no, no, no, the FedEx notes are still in transit! Well, here we all are. No matter the weather, old friends, good times, just the same. Although, sometimes, I think a change might be nice. Why not? Well, they do say it's as good as a rest. Here's a thought. Why don't the girls swap around? What? What? Cherie can do mains tonight and Glenys can do dessert. Well, personally, I think things work fine just the way they are. Tell you what, why don't we discuss it over another botski? Now you're talkin'! For me, techno folk funk is all about combining the infinite potential of the digital age with real world found sounds. I think that's what drew Koolaz to my work. Let's just lay down a simple groove. And then we're going to add the found sound. BARKING But I mean, alone, it's just a dog barking. So we add the thero-lick. And you've got techno folk funk. And then the Koolaz rap kicks in. Yeah, well, I'm afraid we don't have the rights to that bit, so why not just sit back and enjoy the sick sounds of techno folk funk? See the Merry Morris Men of Olde England. Traditional dances brought to Australia by the very first settlers. Gidday, Henry. Been thinking of doing a little slot about Australian folk dancing on my show. Interested? Bloody oath, I'm interested! We were wondering if you could give our charity calendar a bit of a plug, Queenie. It's called Cheeky Morris. Have you done a nudie calendar? Not us. Just Gwyn. It's Gwyn all year. January to December. The print version's a bit slow, but the website's gone mad. I'll bet it has. I'm her IT resource. Digital is the way of the future. Save a tree, go paper-free. TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYS Thank you, friends. And despite the fact that another year has gone by without recognition of invasion in our Constitution, meaning you're still an occupying force, you've been a great crowd. Jack, I need you. I'm doing a show about traditional dance, and you're in it. Whatever you want, Queenie. That's right. Hey. Hey. Whaddup? Whaddup? Yeah, it means how's things? Oh, I know what it means. I just thought you had to be 15 or a dickhead to say it. Congrats on the Koolaz thing, by the way. It's pretty amazing. Well, thanks. I'm...I'm not going to lie. It feels pretty good. What, pleasing a crowd? I pleased myself. If other people like it, well, that's cool. Well, of course, people liked Hitler. Oh, right. I get it. You think my techno folk rap fusion is succumbing to populism? Well, it's popular, isn't it? And you have certainly succumbed. I saw all those young ladies outside your workshop, taking selfies. I didn't succumb. I've been embraced. I'm not an elitist. I don't object to being popular. Right. So on what level is you and your mate, Koolaz, making bong-toking music for stoners any different to the WArrikins making drinking music for drunks? Every level. OK, OK, not... not every level. I do admit I've been... ..a little dismissive of what you do. Really? You think? You're angry at me because... ..because I've shown you what you're scared to do. To take a risk. To follow your talent. Really, have you? How's that? Last year. I left an envelope under your door. Yeah, an application for the Conservatoire. I got it. Well, clearly, you didn't act on it because I know they would have killed for... Actually, I did. You did? Yeah, I applied and I auditioned, and I was sent on my way. I keep it with me, just to remind me how lucky I am to have a band and to make a living. Those crazy idiots! See, Roland, they're not crazy. They're just realistic. I gave that audition everything I had, and guess what? It wasn't enough. I knew it, they certainly knew it, and the only reason you still don't know it is cos you're thinking with your dick. Oh, God, no, absolutely not! Come on, Roland, be honest. If I was a 50-year-old fat dude, would you really be so concerned about my unique talent? No, that... Look, that is beside the point. Roland, I'm not your fantasy girl. I am a 26-year-old folk chick who dances a bit, plays the fiddle a bit, and is lucky enough to get paid for it. Now leave me alone. Go back to your groupies and your barking bitch. But these bloody boat people are just jumping the queue! Except, if you think about it, the first Poms were boat people. The people the British displaced were Aborigines. So if you're seriously suggesting to me that their culture is of equal value to ours, then you're an even bigger bloody idiot than I thought. Look at that dance troupe. If you call skipping around naked, covered in paint, pretending to be an emu, a dance. Ha! Bloody ridiculous! Ruby, it's a brand-new phone! I left it right here on the table. SHE SIGHS Well, luckily, it's on the Cloud, so, I don't know, I'll just Find My Phone or something. Find my... Oh, here we go. OK, OK, OK, it's searching. Searching. BEEPING Oh, dear. BELLS JINGLE Australia's a proud nation. Founded on armed invasion and ethnic cleansing. What's to be proud of? Come to an Anzac dawn service, mate. You'll find out. Where's the dawn service to all the black fellas who died when the Europeans first came? Where's the bloody memorial? You'd need a wall as big as Uluru to put their names on. It happened, all right? And it's still happening! I was taken away from my family when I was eight years old. Think about that. Australia's a proud country. SHE WHISTLES Well, boys, if we're going to discuss the Stolen Generation and the Anzac legend, we might need a...a little bit more time. But at least we're talking. Jack, you'd better come. Jessie's in trouble, and it isn't for saying fuck. You're a bloody fool, Jessie. You're a bloody idiot. You know you're tagged. Call the police, Olivia. Come on, he'll get youth detention. Let me deal with him. I swear I'll sort him all out. You're big on the law when it comes to your treaty and your land rights, but when it comes to other people's property... We're dealing with a deprived kid here. Oh, I know plenty about deprived kids. I was one, and I didn't steal. Dad, I don't think that we need to call the police. We found the phone. No, but what about the rest of us? We don't want to share our campsite with a thief. Well, if you won't call them, I will. I stole it! I stole it, Gramps, and I gave it to that kid. Ruby, darling, I know you want to help him, but you hardly know him. I didn't steal it for him. I stole it because you're a bitch! You get a brand-new iPhone, and I get Gramp's old Nokia. I gave the phone to him because I could see that he wanted it and we stole his country and... ..and Gramps is a racist! Ruby! You are so grounded when you get home. Um... Sorry, can I grab the... Yeah. Thank you. So... ..you still going to call the cops? Have the little white girl arrested? No? I thought not. Well, it looks like us mob'll have to share the campsite with a thief. Nothing to see here. Come on, boys. I think maybe you should have let that kid keep your phone. What's that, Dad? Oh, I've just been sitting here, having a bit of a look at myself as well. I thought maybe you should too. Mind you, you can't see yourself if you're staring at your bloody phone, can you? # Jack took two pistols from his belt # He proudly waved them high... # Hey, Roland! # I'll fight but not surrender Cried # That wild colonial guy # Whoo! # Can we get a photo? Sorry. Stop, stop, stop! Watch the gig. I'm sorry for any of you trying to enjoy our poor, old-fashioned little gig, but there is a techno urban folk funk dog-washer up the back, doing selfies with his fans. Now this is Whisky In The Jar. I thought perhaps we might go and see a bit of music later. Really? That's not like us. But something different could be nice. Yeah, but different isn't always a good thing. I tell you what. Why don't we have another botski while we decide? Hey! I'm going to give my voice a rest now and pass you over to my da, Eamon O'Reilly. Thanks, Keevey. I'd like to sing you a little song that was... ..might have been written many years ago but I've always felt that it was kind of written just for me. You see, I met my beautiful wife, Mary, when she was just 16. And I lost her when our lovely daughter, Keevey, was the same age. So, this is my favourite song in all the world... ..which is funny because it always breaks my heart. MUSIC: SWEET SIXTEEN # When first I saw the love light in your eyes # I thought that life held not the joy # For me # Although we may have drifted far apart # I never dreamed but what I dream I feel # I love you As I've never loved before # Since first I saw you on the village green # Come to me Or my dream of love is o'er # I love you as I love you # When you were sweet # When you were sweet # Sixteen. # Piss off, son. I just want to talk to her. Listen mate, she doesn't want to see you, all right? She's not interested in your or your academy bullshit. I don't care that the academy didn't get it. I think Keevey's good enough to... Oh, she's good enough. Good enough for what she wants to be and way too good for a pretentious little bumfluff hipster like you. At least the blokes who normally pester her have got some balls and they don't slag her off for not being Stephane fucking Grappelli, either. Just keep away, Roland. And if I see you bothering Keevey again, you'll regret it. Hey dude. I'm Maddison. That's Indiana. Can we talk to you for a second? We have lots of Muslim girls at our school. Some of the wear the headscarf, which, like, I respect, but as a woman it kind of makes me feel uncomfortable about. Hey guys. Hi. Sorry, I just... Rube, can I have a quick word? What? Oh, yeah OK. What? I've turned it off. I've put it in the car. Put what in the car? My phone. You're kidding. Are you ill? No, I'm not ill, I just... I'm sorry. I know I'm always on it, and I'm sorry... It's OK. No, darling, it's not OK. I want things to be different, and you stealing that phone was making some kind of statement and... I didn't steal it. The dancing kid did. Did he? I just didn't think he should go to prison for it. No, no, no, I... No, definitely not. No, he... Anyway, it doesn't make any difference. The point is, I've turned my phone off, it's in the car, and I would love it if we could do something together tonight. What? Well, we're at a folk festival. We could go and see an act. We could take Gramps. Yeah, OK. Sorry, I have to... That's OK. So that biddy didn't want to know, right? She went off with her mum, but that's OK. I'm used to people not wanting to know. You think she's hot? I don't know. Oh, yeah, you do! She's all right, too. Me and her got a connection. He can hook you up if you want. It's a nice dream. Dude, we're Aboriginal. Dreams are real to us. You girls are great. You're really, really talented, and music's always going to be in your lives, there's no doubt about that. But you have to ask yourself, is it your vocation? Is it the only thing you want? Yes. Then you have to make music for itself, not because it'll get you a hit. You have to know that, even if, after a lifetime of playing, you never get that hit, you'll still believe you made the right choice. Wow. That'd be so fucked up. Yeah. There's a band playing tonight, an Afghani folk band. My guess is they're unlikely to ever get a hit and they probably know it, but still, they play. I can't believe the guy who worked with Koolaz just showed me how to open tune a guitar. He's such a dope dude. It's like he really cared about our music. He actually took us seriously, and he didn't even try and hit on us. Yeah, that was a bit weird. Good evening. My name is Baktash, and we are Umid from Afghanistan. Umid is the Hazari word for hope, and we humbly hope you enjoy our Afghan music tonight. FOLK MUSIC PLAYS Three more jellybeans and I'm up another level. Oh, that's nice. Interesting article on the advanced vacuum distributor. Hm. Red and white wristbands are required for express glamping bathroom access. White and red wristbands for the general purpose bathroom facility. If the red part of the band is closest to the armpit, then you are good for glamping. If the white part of the wristband is closest to the armpit, then you must only access general purpose bathroom facility. TOILET FLUSHES Is that clear? Ooh! Ah! Good to go. Steady. You've given us such a special night tonight. What has been special for you? Well, Queenie... ..we come from a place where there is no music, no laughter. A place where our freedom is oppressed, where we are imprisoned without trial... ..without hope. My friends, we come from hell. But the hell I described is not the homeland we ran from, seeking freedom and a better life. It is in the land we ran to. The hell I described is the detention camp where we are imprisoned without hope. We are forgotten. We are dying. I would like to thank Queenie and the Westival organisers for arranging this concert and the authorities for allowing it. But above all... ..I would like to thank my young friend, Jafaar, for thinking up the whole plan. Jafaar was just ten when he arrived in Australia. He had lost his parents and his home. When he came, he was... ..confused. He was alone, was traumatised. And Australia was... ..not kind to him, did not welcome him. It put him in that camp. I can see that our brief moment of freedom is over. We must return to camp. We've lost everything... ..and we ask for nothing. Nothing but the chance to begin again. So, please, remember our name. Umid. Hope. We've never done that before. No. It's a change. No, I'm sorry Jools, I don't want to do this. Babes, we're right here. Come on... No, really... I don't want to. I thought I did, but I've changed my mind, OK? Oh, you've changed your mind. OK, what am I? A pizza? Why would you Tinder me if you don't want a root? Swiping right isn't a contract, OK? It is an expression of interest, and I have lost interest. Oh, come on, babes! It's too late to hook up with anyone else. Let's just do it. It's fine. I said no, Jools! Now fuck off! Hey, thanks for the great bloody evening... ..in opposite world, you prick-teasing bitch! Hey! That's my daughter you're talking to. And what are you going to do about it? Yeah, mate? Dad, stop it! Leave him alone! Be careful, lad. You're half my age but, in a fight, what counts is experience. Get out of here before he kills you. Go on! Dad, you can't just punch people out for being dickheads. Really, love? I thought that's exactly why you DID punch them out. I'm always going to be here for you, Keevey. You know that, don't you? Yeah, I know, Dad. Goodness gracious! Another year, another Westival! Back her in, back her in, back her in, back her in! Tags, passes, keys! HE YAWNS So, yeah, I just, um, pray for the strength to keep going. My name is Smoko, and I'm four hours sober. To be clear, Smoko... ..four hours sober means four hours consciously pursuing sobriety, not four hours unconsciously shitfaced. You do see the distinction? This year, we have another real community star to celebrate, and guess what? It's the Westival itself! Yes, the Westival has joined numerous other great WA institutions like Bumbles Hardware, Rockmantle City Council and the famous Academie Conservatoire in going entirely paper-free. Well done us! I have two things to tell you. Hey, I'm glad you shaved that beard off. Wasn't a fan. The Academie Conservatoire is paper-free! I don't want to hear anything else about the Academie Conservatoire... "While we accept initial applications by post, "all further correspondence will be to the e-mail address "entered on the application form." Is that one of the things you came here to tell me? What e-mail address did you supply, Keevey? The WArrikins'. My dad's. It's the only one we've got. Do you still carry that rejection letter with you? You all know Henry of the Merry Morris Men of Olde WA. What have you got for us, mate? Well, Queenie, we'd like to invite your listeners along to a very special show. And let me promise you, this is one Morris Dance you do not want to miss. Not that you'd ever want to miss any Morris Dance. Another Westival, another round. I need to lubricate my picking fingers. It's a great gig, isn't it? Keevey, darling, will you have a beer? Roland accessed your deleted e-mails, Da. He doesn't know the password. "thewarrikins", all lower case. I got it in one. They accepted me. They even offered me a scholarship. You deleted the e-mail. You forged a rejection letter. And how can you do it? You're my dad. I didn't mean to... I... It was... When I got that e-mail, I was so pleased for you, darling. I really was. And... And, uh... And then...then I got scared. Keevey, I... ..I didn't know what I'd do without you. You're all we've got. You're all I've got. What was the other thing? What? You said you had two things to tell me. What was the other thing? Oh, right, well... ..I was going to mention that I'm in love with you. It's probably the wrong time. Maybe a bit. Your dad did a terrible thing, love. But he's a sick man. He's a sick, lonely, old man. Hello, Keevey. Didn't know you had a problem with drinking. She's had a problem with drinking all her life, mate. Yours. Yeah, well, things to do. Thanks. Well, Pam. Can you help me? Let's hear it for Henry Foreman and Chief Squire of the Merry Morris Men of Olde England. Thank you, Queenie. Well, this is a lovely little festival, isn't it? We all meet, we all mix. "Australia in a tent," as Queenie likes to call it. You have all sorts of people come along to Westival, with all sorts of stories. Now, take mine, for instance. I didn't have the easiest start in life. No, not complaining, you understand, just...just saying. And it made me who I am. A fellow who even my mates sometimes find hard to like. Who even my lovely granddaughter sometimes found hard to like. I think the problem was that I was only looking at my own story, as if it was the only one that mattered. And then I started to have a look round... ..at all the other people in the tent. Like young Jessie here. And Jafaar. And I heard Jafaar's story, and I realised that it wasn't all that different from my own. What I reckon is... ..that unless we start listening to each other's stories... ..we won't begin to understand our own. So today, in my capacity as Foreman and Chief Squire of the Merry Morris Men of Olde England, WA... ..I would like to honour and celebrate the oldest Australian story of them all. And I'd like to thank you, Jack, for allowing me to share in your... ..your culture and your spirit. DIDGERIDOO PLAYS APPLAUSE AND CHEERING I am seeking to contact one of the festival artists. Kindly assist me. I do not see a wrist tag, Madam. Health and safety regs require all visitors to have one. Do I look like the kind of person to allow my wrist to be tagged? Well, you will not have access to the portaloos. I will not require access to the portaloos. I would rather die. Where I went to school, girls were taught to hold on. Are you going to assist me or aren't you? You look like a very smart, efficient, useful kind of girl. Madam, how can I help you, madam? That remains to be seen. Hi. Thought maybe you'd come by. Well, no. I thought that, you know, you'd have a lot to think about, what with your dad and all. Well, not really. When he's been dry a year, then we can talk. I'm going to play tonight's gig and then, after that, he's on his own. But guess who did come to see me? Who? Professor Wellborn. Ah, good! She said she spoke to you. Yes, I...I did. I hope that's OK. Yeah, of course it is. In fact, she, uh... ..she still wants me for the scholarship. That's great! Yeah. Well, I told her I'd think about it. You'd think about it? Yeah, well, you know, there's a lot to take in. Besides, anyway, I mainly talked to her about you. Me? Mm-hm. She told me all about how you inspired her to audition for the Conservatoire. Hello, Professor Wellborn. I didn't realise you were still here. She wants to talk to you. About what? About music! Keevey tells me that you love to talk about music. And you can play it on ten different instruments. Yes, Keevey, but there are ten people that are better on each of those. Maybe 100. Not everybody can be the best. But everybody can be the best that they can be. But to achieve that, they need enablers, Roland. Mentors and tutors who can see their potential but have a passion for unlocking it. She means teachers, Roland. Come and work for me. Unlock talent, enable passion. You can start by convincing Keevey here to take up her scholarship. Linda and I are leaving now. But I will be expecting to hear from both of you. Oh, don't disappoint me! Do not disappoint her. Linda! Wow, I seem to be the object of some sort of intervention. Well, yeah, it's a bit of a taste of your own medicine, huh? Come on, Roland, be a teacher. It's what you do. Will you give yourself a chance? I don't know. Maybe. Will you? I don't know. I mean, I think I want to. Well, you're going to have to now, otherwise Professor Wellborn will set her girlfriend on me. And then there's the other thing. The other thing? You said that you were in love with me. And I was just really confused. You know, it was... ..it was so the wrong time and actually I'm... ..I'm sorry because I...I shouldn't have said anything... Roland, Roland, Roland! I was confused because it made me realise that... Well, I'm... ..I'm totally in love with you too. Really? Yeah, really. But just...I was scared. Why? Because love is based on trust, and I barely know you. You know, we've had one amazing kiss and about 15 massive fights, and we're just not exactly an obvious fit. But the best harmonies never are. Your lines are really improving. I just don't want to get hurt, Roland. I know what that feels like, and it sucks. I'd never hurt you, Keevey. I...I love you too much. I've loved you since the day you blew up my amplifier. Just give me a chance... ..to prove it. OK. Would you please make welcome the WArrikins and techno folk funk? APPLAUSE AND CHEERING THEREMIN PLAYS FIDDLE PLAYS # There was a wild colonial boy # Who left his native home # And to Australia's sunny shores # He was inclined to roam # He robbed the rich He helped the poor # He shot James McEvoy # A terror to Australia was # That white colonial boy. # And a real Westival favourite, Diamond, is with us once again. Do you have another treat in store for us, Diamond? Yes Queenie, I do. A recitation. Oh. 100 years ago, a very talented and strong woman named Dorothea McKellar wrote, "I love a sunburnt country, a wide brown land for me." Oh, wonderful inspiring poem, yeah. Yes, well, I think if she were writing today she would probably write something quite a lot more angry. I hate a gender-specific country, a land of sweeping bigots, of ragged, transphobic Internet trolls, of inadequate intolerant white men. And I've been taking guitar lessons with Tman. Tman? He calls him the Theraman because he plays the theremin. See what he did with that? Here we all are again, eh? Yep, here we are. Good year? Oh, absolutely. We resaid our vows on the beach. It was so romantic. Oh, we did ours again too! Barefoot in white pyjamas. We were barefoot in white pyjamas! No! Oh, what? What? That's crazy! Well, you know, that funny old night we had last year. Shook things up a bit. ALL: Yeah! Back to normal now, eh? Oh, yeah. Well, the quicker we get set up, the quicker we can get stuck into the botskis! ALL: Yay! Don't even think about it. Hey. I'm Maddison, and I'm Feminasty. This is quite a sad song, actually. It's about regret, broken dreams and betrayal. Mostly, it's about betrayal. I hate her lack of horizon, I hate her poison sea, her bankers and her miners, a wide, shit-coloured land for me. Thank you, Diamond. As ever, plenty to think about and apologies for the fruity language. Binge drinking and anti-social behaviour will be met with zero tolerance. Know your limits, drink responsibility. Enjoy your night. Microbrewed beer in the bar? I don't recognise Australia any more. Too hoppy. Too fruity. Don't want that much taste in a beer. "A rich amber brew with hints of burnt grapefruit and vanilla." It's a beer, not a puddin'! Thank you. You've been amazing. # I got a new friend I think I met her outside # She's so lovely She said she'd give me a ride # So many new friends I think I'm having a ball # And in the morning I'll remember them all # New friends, new friends New friends # Gonna have them all # I got a new friend # I got a new friend # I got a new friend # I got a new friend # New friends, new friends New friends # Gonna write on my wall. #
