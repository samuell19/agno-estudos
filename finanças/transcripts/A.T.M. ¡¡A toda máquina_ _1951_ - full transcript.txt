Of course not, the one you gave me had holes in the backside. That?s why I gave it to You. Hmm, That?s what a good way to do favors. Maybe you want me to give you a sister also ? Ok don?t scold me more. It?s enough saying don?t wear that suit. Oh, oportunistic plus delicate. I ask you sir to do not ofend me. If that is the big deal I can take off the suit and it?s over. But the fact that I wear it, gives no right to destroy a mans dignity. You will see, The first quality from a gentleman... Go to hell with your speeches. That?s fine, I?ll Shut up my mouth. But at least You can say thank you. Thank you ? For what ? Yes ! Have you seen your place ? Come on, talk ! it?s not the same mess you have before, everything in the floor, nasty. Ok Ok.

See your face in the mirror, come on, see it. You are right, Is a woman?s fault. Did she brake up with you ? I broke up with her, that?s different. Ok Ok, but is not Anita?s fault. Remember you get 15 once. Women a lot of times. But she has the hope you can be her dance partner. The other one is sick. I?m sure she can find somebody else. She said You are a great dancer. Not at all, not at all. I think she is very in love of you. But she is just a kid. Girls also fall in love. Let me explain you. Love is like an arrow, who hit the heart like a target. No more speeches. I prefer go to the party. But I just have one Frac. What are you going to do ? God is so good. Dressing the birds. Do you think he will not give a Frac ? Where is the next Dry Cleaner ? Congratulations, You look so pretty. Do you know the Sir ? Nice to meet you. Congratulations. Thanks. Hmmm. Excuse me. Let?s go. -What about a cookie ? -Thanks. Glutton ! Hey, You are a very good dancer. Do you want a cookie ? No thanks.

And this night will be the happiest in my life. -And did he propose to you ? -No. He loves somebody else. Come on, don?t go around there thinking about that stuffs. You are too young to have that issues. Of course, I?m just good cleanning your house. Not to love me. -Did you clean my house ? -Let?s be clear. I asked you if you liked how your place looks ? Not that I cleaned it. -What is not the same ? Are you agree ? -Ok. Dance this melody with the lady, I will have a drink. What do You think if we better sit down to eat some cookies ? Loves make you lost the appetite. That?s why I never fall in love. -A cognac please. -Yes sir. No, double. -Like this one ? -Like this one better ! Leave him alone Anita. Don?t go. He will get drunk. He is drinking to much. Who knows if for his troubles is a little. -If you really appreciate him... Appreciate him ? I have him in my soul. In your age the soul is like a sponge, It?s just enough to squeeze it to take off everything. -I wait so long to be 15 years old. -You will wait more to be 30. -Can we go out to the terrace ? -As you wish. Gentlleman. Congratulations. This lady was my girlfriend since today. She also put everything in my mouth. You will also love Guillermina as I did. And You will get drunk. And one day You will tell to some idiot guy, "Gentleman, congratulations". And You will invite him, just like I?m doing right now, to go out and fight. To fight ? How ? With stones, guns, sticks, baseball bats, whatever. The point is kill each other. Drunk ! Did you hear her ? She gave the champagne from the same glass too. And she squeezed me the pimples from my face. But the unfortunate thing will be, that with 10 years to say my name, it?ll be very hard to learn yours. -By the way, What is your name ? -Tarcicio.

But before kill each other, I will introduce you with the society, like the new couple in love. -What a big news... -Don?t do that, I will look ridiculous. My friend, I see, you love her a lot. So I quite the battle. But if You insist to fight, I?m still here. I?m a Esgrima teacher, shooter in the army and I teach box at the YMCA. You are a great guy. Also I feel like i will let her with you. Because She is like a brave dog, who bite everybody at home And the want to give it. But with somebody who feed him. -Did you hear ? He is calling me dog. -He is saying, He loves You. Like I said, You are a great man. But let me tell everybody inside. -I?m sorry Guille, but I don?t want to be between lovers. -You humilliated me, get out here. I?m sorry but He is a good guy. May I have your attention please.
