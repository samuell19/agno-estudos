{Narrator] For 400 years, the ancient art of astrology had slumbered, ignored by scientists, feared by the church, the tool of gypsies, charlatans, and thieves, waiting for the astrologer. Alexei Abarnel is the astrologer, a brilliant, hard-headed scientist, who used the enormous leaps in astronomy and the most advanced computers to refine the art of astrology into an exact science. The astrologer wanted to use these new tools for the benefit of mankind. He formed an organization called Interzod, an organization which could monitor the astrological potential or the zodiacal potential, as Alexei called it, of everyone in the world. Interzod changed the course of history. Alexei tried to change destiny itself. He dared to investigate the ultimate biblical prophecy: that the virgin birth will reoccur and the child shall come again. There was, however, one problem that not even Alexei had foreseen. There were two forces trying to father that child. One, of course, was ultimate good. The other was equally ancient, but undeniably evil. It is now 10 days before the second coming. But whose child will it be? Voice check, Abarnel. {Woman] Surveillance Sydney Bureau. Thompson here regarding Miss O'Connor. Miss O'Connor? What's the problem? {Woman] She's announced her intentions of running for the city council. Don't bother to discourage her. Sooner or later she's going to solve your problem for you. The psychopathic indications are very high. We have 32 zodiacal facsimiles and all but four have been committed to asylums. If the campaign doesn't send her off the deep end, then a crushing defeat at the polls should do it. If necessary, that should be easy to arrange. - {Woman] All right, we'll take care of it. Bye. {Man] Welcome to Interzod headquarters. Today we're going to discuss an East Indian named Kajerste. We are now able, using computers, to accurately determine an individual's zodiacal potential for response to environmental situations and stimuli. Kajerste's zodiacal potential for evil is so high that he must dominate others. He has no choice. His activities have included ritualistic mutilations and public defloration ceremonies. - In a country such as India we have great trouble discovering the facts about the births of people already born. But we have extraordinary luck in Kajerste's case. He was known to the police in Bengali, Bangladesh, and Mysore. From those police records we discovered that he was born in a hospital in Bombay and was the bastard son of a Portuguese army officer- Excuse me, Professor. I think we should point out that we don't often work in reverse order. If the only way we had of calculating a person's zodiacal potential was by following his daily life, we'd need three and one half billion agents. The backwards procedure we used for Kajerste is generally reserved for historical figures. Using their detailed life histories, we can check and fine tune our zodiacal formulas, expanding them to bring more human factors and characteristics into consideration. Our Interzod computers are constantly scanning the infinite astrological configurations swirling through our universe in search of potentially troublesome zP's. We know long before someone is born whether or not he'll need looking after. Hello? Ah, come in. - Excuse me. - Come in. Sit down. Thank you. - I guess you would like to have your fortune told. Well, yes. - Well, first you must answer some questions. Then I'll be able to construct your horoscope and predict your future. How old are you? What is your birthday? Where do you live and what do you do? Well, I live in New Jersey. I'm married. My husband works as a high school teacher and I work part time as a dance instructor. What is your birthdate? July 22, 1953. I'm 23. You're not telling me the truth. If that were your real birthdate, you would be 24. Someone is exerting a strong hold over you, preventing you from telling the truth. We must strip away your pretenses. Go behind that screen and take off your clothes. Put on that robe. Then we will be able to find out who you really are. We have just captured Kajerste. We want you to keep him a few days here till the District Magistrate comes. I can't keep him here! Well, he's harmless. He's all chained, look at him. Don't tell me your troubles, old man. He must stay here. I'm not a jailer, I can't keep him here. {Radio Announcer] Good morning. It's 8 a.m. at WMHF and it's- You did what? - Well, there's nothing so bad about that, is there? No, it sounds like fun in a way. Who was this person? She called herself Mother Bogarde. I don't know what her real name is. I mean, you can't call yourself Mother O'Brien and expect people to believe in you. I suppose not. Well, what happened? Did she tell your fortune? No, not really. She just said there were great things ahead for me. You know, the usual things people like to hear. Alexei, you're not angry, are you? You don't care that I went, do you? No, why should I be angry? Neil was with you. No, it was all very private. Yes, I suppose it might be. You know, I've always wanted to go talk to one of those people, but I never found the nerve to go in there. How do they go about spiritual advising? I mean, do they, uh, ask a lot of questions? - Alexei, you don't really want to hear about all this, do you? I do want to hear about it, Kate. It was just strange. She asked me to take off all my clothes. She what? Alex- Well, that's strange, all right. And what did you say? Say? I don't know what I said. Oh, I said lots of things before that, but... Well, she asked me a lot of questions. {Alexei] Such as? - Well, it was kind of like a questionnaire you fill out when you're looking for a job. Alexei. You promised. Kate, I am not angry. Now, what about the questions? - Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. She wouldn't believe me. She said it was as if someone exerted a strong hold over me that prevented me from telling the truth. That's when she made me take off all my clothes. Made you take off your clothes? Do you mean you actually took them off? Hi. I'm running a little late this morning. Perhaps I should take a bite in the kitchen? - No, perhaps you should sit down and join us. You didn't know I went to see a spiritual advisor yesterday, did you? No. I didn't know you went for that sort of thing. What was she like? Well, it's hard to describe, you know. She didn't seem like a fake or anything. She seemed to know when I was telling her the truth and when I was just making things up. You could see how strange that would be when you're not expecting it. For one thing, she asked me my birthday and she caught me in a lie. - What do you mean she caught you in a lie? Well, I began by saying that I was 23 and then I forgot to add a year when I told her my birthday. She told me I had to tell her the truth or she wouldn't be able to do my horoscope. You know, those signs that they always use. Maybe I should leave you two alone? You stay right where you are. Kate, what birthdate did you give her? I gave her my real birthday. The one you gave me when you found my new birth certificate. Alexei, I didn't give her my old one, the one I always thought was right before I met you. Especially since I told you I'd never tell anyone what date that was. Although... I don't understand why something like that would be so important to you, especially since it's wrong. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm making a big deal about this. Listen, sweetheart, I'm going to be gone for several days now. You take care. I'll be in touch. Did I miss Flight 802? Yes, you did. But we have a flight at 9:30. That's the only one you have? Yes. Okay, here's your ticket and boarding card. We have a first class lounge around the corner. You can wait there. - All right. - Okay? - Thank you. - Have a nice trip. I'm thinking about Jerusalem, Alexei. Yanakov's suggestion doesn't sit right with me. It's not the proper manipulation. I admit it's a bit severe, but Wembley must have those documents. Do you have a better solution? There are ways. I will find the best one. Okay. But let me know as soon as you find it. This is very important to me. I know that, Alexei. You will have them very soon. - {Airport Announcer] BOAC Flight 211 airbus service for Paris and Rome is now ready for boarding at Gate E12. BOAC Flight 211 airbus service for Paris and Rome is now ready for boarding at Gate E12. Excuse me. Aren't you Alexei Abarnel? Yes. Congressmen Joe Harwell. I met you once in Senator Wiley's office. Oh, yes! Yes, I remember. What are you doing here? My rental car broke down and I missed my flight to Washington. I won't be able to get on another plane until 9:30 tonight. Well, you can ride with us. We have lots of room on our plane. Oh, really? Are you sure it's no problem? No, no problem at all. We'll be leaving in a few minutes. We'd better get boarded now. Great. - {Airport Announcer] Would Mr. Jeanbedu please come to the information desk. - Do you make a habit of giving free rides to congressmen? Only certain ones. Hello, Rhav. Hi, Alexei. Say, when are we ready for takeoff? We were waiting for you, sir. I'm ready anytime. I'm Joseph Harwell. {Alexei] Congressman Harwell. - I'm Ellen Rheborne Gavabio, but I'm usually called Rhav. {Alexei] Did you find Kajerste? The troops took him late yesterday. There was a lot of confusion for a while, but confirmation came a few hours before I left. Porter was on his way to the upper valley again to take charge. I'd have thought you'd heard by this time. No, no, I hadn't. You sure Kajerste killed those people? I saw those scars. I'd recognize them anywhere. We're being very rude. Does any of this make sense to you? No, I'm afraid not. This must sound pretty awful. Shop talk at Interzod sometimes gets grim. Thank God it isn't always that way. I'm sorry I've been so rude, Congressman Harwell, I would have enjoyed talking to you. Please, don't apologize. And I'd appreciate it if you'd call me Joe. I'm apologizing for a conversation that couldn't help but leave you out. I've heard a good deal about you. I hope very much we meet again soon and that you'll let me listen to you. {Joe] I'd like that. Goodnight, gentlemen. Goodnight, Rhav. I meant to get in contact with you a long time before this. If I hadn't bumped into you, you would've heard from me. I've been wondering if you would care to become more closely associated with us and our operation. As a congressman? Oh, of course, as a congressman. You're young and popular and I think you have the potential to be around for quite a while. You're a member of the House Armed Services Committee, so you're already aware of the special funding we receive through hidden sections of the defense bill. Although you probably don't know why. {Joe] True. Well, I want to explain that to you. We are on the verge of a major breakthrough, the product of a vast commitment to historical research. Because we've been so secretive about our operations in the past, we sometimes have difficulty obtaining the funding that we need. I want to show you how we are already benefiting society. Perhaps through a case history like the one Rhav is working on. Because quite frankly, we need your support. I must admit, I've always been curious as to exactly what it is that you do. There's a strange aura surrounding you on Capitol Hill. It's almost as if no one is allowed to ask questions. Will you excuse me a minute? {Kate] Alexei. Hi, Kate, how are you? {Kate] I'm fine. How are you? Oh, I'm fine, fine, of course. Listen, I'll be home for dinner tomorrow night. {Kate] Can I call you? No. No, you can't reach me, but don't worry, I'll be there by seven. {Kate] But we have a dinner date. - I know we have a dinner date with Wembley. Don't worry, I won't be late. {Kate] I miss you, Alexei. I miss you, too. {Kate] See you tomorrow. Bye. You don't have to make up your mind about this now. Just think it over for a while. You'll probably want to discuss it with me again before you decide. Yes, I would. - Well, it looks like I'm going to be called on for several hours at least. Listen, why don't you go in the dormitory and catch a nap? It's going to be several hours before we land. That sounds like a great idea. Right this way. The dormitory is right through that door. We'll have some dinner when we land. Get some rest. Thank you, Alexei. Your trouble is appreciated. My pleasure. Could you play me the transmission on the Crab Nebula? Voice check, Abarnel. Good evening. Some coffee? Oh, great. Where is everybody? - Alexei and Rhav had to leave as soon as we landed. He'll be in touch in a few days. You're in a good mood. You must be planning on having a very good time in New York. I'll never tell. - Well, give my regards to whatever his name is. I will. Say hello to Kate for me. You know, Alexei, I've never even met her. It's like you keep her locked up. There's a rumor you're taking her to Wembley's for dinner, but I don't believe it. I don't keep her locked up. Everything okay? Everything's fine. Fine, I'm going to check the south gate. - In May of 1945, a group of scientists stood silently in a small concrete bunker near Los Alamos, New Mexico, looking at a TV monitor. After a moment, one of them, the great Italian physicist Enrico Fermi said, ''Gentlemen, I invite bets. Against first the destruction of all human life, second, just that of the human race in the state of New Mexico.'' And then without hesitating, he pushed a button and detonated the world's first atomic bomb. The point of this story is simply that Fermi wasn't kidding. The knowledge scientists had up to that moment about nuclear fission simply wasn't enough to ensure that the chain reaction, once started, would ever stop before it destroyed the entire Earth. In the end, even the master, Albert Einstein, could only say, ''I cannot believe that God would play dice with the universe.'' Yes? - Doesn't the possibility of one of your nuclear reactors exploding and completely demolishing a major city scare you? - Well, some say the chances of a nuclear reactor killing tens of thousands of people are about the same as a fully loaded 747 crashing into the Los Angeles Coliseum during the Super Bowl. But such statistics would be of little comfort to the dead. I am very often afraid, but the more frightened I am, the more careful I try to be. But don't you get involved in things you feel you don't have any control over? I mean... Don't some things ever happen that you feel you'll never understand? All the time. It's just that I've learned to accept them and more importantly, not be ashamed of them. - I feel like we're going to the high school prom. No wonder. We hardly ever go out. We're going out tonight. For a change. You know that I'm a little nervous about meeting Wembley. Wembley? Oh, he has a great sense of humor. You'll like him. Yes, but will he like me? I've never met any of your friends before. Well, maybe he'll like you. Robert, good to see you. Robert, this is my wife, Kate. Hello. - Kate, this is my dear friend Robert Wembley, that boring old archeologist I warned you about. Oh, I'm sure that's not true. It's so very nice to meet you. So good to meet you. Come here with me. This is really a lovely room. Well, you certainly make it lovely just walking in here. Why, thank you. Have a seat. Sit, Alexei. Oh, thank you. We're having beef wellington tonight. I hope it's all right. Oh, that's all right. With me. I think Kate might prefer a hamburger. Oh, Alexei. The way Beulah makes beef wellington, it's going to taste like hamburger. Oh, are we having a seminar, too? No, just some wine right now. Oh, I can go for that. There, my love. Oh, thank you. And you, my dear friend. But this looks interesting. What is it? Oh. This is a reproduction of a document that goes all the way back to the First Century. But uh- It's written in Ethiopian. I believe this will bring us close to a genuine verification of the Virgin Mary's birthdate. We can then finally determine the Madonna's zodiacal potential. Enough of this boring old shop talk. Let's drink to Alexei's beautiful young bride. - Would you two excuse me for just one minute, please? Sure. Oh, that's not necessary. Please stay seated. - Kate has no Interzod clearance whatsoever. She doesn't even know it exists. She thinks I'm a consultant for the Energy Research Development Administration. She knows nothing about my real work. I simply had no idea. I'm sorry. Oh, it's nothing. Do you think that document's important? Uh, possibly a genuine verification. And is it specific about her birthday? It narrows the maximum latitude to about eight days and four hours. But without the Jerusalem document, I can't be sure. If I had that document, I could pinpoint the Virgin Mary's birthdate to the exact hour. - Wembley, you're going to have that document, one way or the other. Very soon. That was a nice job you did on Wiley. Thanks. Say, I've been meaning to ask you, how's Senator Wiley? You see him in Washington, don't you? Oh, yeah. He's recovered from that accident, but it's kept him off the Hill for about three weeks now. Really? Oh, yeah. I didn't know he was that badly hurt. Mm-hmm. Say, how's that wife of his? Doesn't she work in um, Urban Renewal? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Spoke to her a couple of days ago. Everything is well. Oh, good. She's a hard worker, that girl. I saw her at a party in Georgetown about a year ago. That was the last time. - So, you make the Washington social scene, huh? Ah, no. No, not really. Not the way I used to. {Joe] This is a nice library. Who uses it? Robert Wembley, mostly. This is the historical research section where history, ancient and recent, is examined, made intelligible, and gleaned for vital facts. This is really the bottom line at Interzod. By studying how people born under various astrological configurations have reacted in the past, we're better able to predict how people living today are apt to respond. - How do you keep track of all this information? Well, come on, I'll show you. This is the communication center. On any given day, Interzod is monitoring over 4000 exceptional zP's around the world. By using computers, we're able to keep track of the thousands of manipulations we're performing simultaneously. We also use the computers to store any new information we get from the historical research section. If I were to give you the exact date of my great-grandfather's birth, could you tell me what his life was like? Only what his life could have been like. His potentials. But I'd have no way of knowing what his environment did to him. Unless a zodiacal potential is extremely strong in a given direction, it can be easily neutralized by environmental factors. - Alexei, do you know your own zodiacal potential? No, I don't. I never punched it in. I don't want to know. What about mine? You don't want to know either. This is the old observatory, where I began putting things together and where I formulated my first zodiacal potential. It's funny. Now I have my own computer, access to any equipment I want, and a huge jet plane to fly it all around. In a way it's too bad. It's taken millions of dollars and thousands of hours to figure out something that maybe shouldn't have even left this room. Because of me we can now wiretap directly into a man's soul. And all we need to know is his birthday. Don't be so hard on yourself, Alexei. If you hadn't discovered it, someone else might have and possibly used it in a much less benevolent way. - You know what Albert Einstein's last words were? No. ''If I could live my life over again, I'd be a carpenter or a plumber.'' - Do you really think he would have done that? No. No more than I would. Oh, the old astrologers or the daily horoscopers expect everyone to have a destiny. They just don't realize that the average astrological configuration is extremely balanced, almost neutral. Most people are simply the results of undisturbed genetic potential and environment, their only destiny to become bogged down in their neighbor's mud. Only the zodiacally privileged are above it. Oh, there are such people. And they remake the world. History has given us the prototypes. Their zodiacal configurations are truly astonishing. I'll show you sometime. The Buddha configuration, the Napoleonic, the great messiahs, really remarkable. But most people are simply products of environment, their only destiny to fight the clay that clings to their feet. Some are born great, some are uncompromisingly evil, most are simply the result of pomp and circumstance. The only ones who are truly above it all are the zodiacally privileged. The only thing they're condemned to is themselves. They have no choice. God help the man who would stand in the way of someone truly destined. Hi, Alexei. How did your day go? Tiring. How was yours? Oh, pretty good. You know what day it is today, don't you? No. It's our fifth month anniversary. Don't you want to give me a kiss? That wasn't much of a kiss for a fifth month anniversary. Would you like some wine? No, thank you. Alexei, you never drink with me either. Are you sure you even like me? You know I like you. It's just that I'm very tired and I'm really not very hungry either. Look, I'm going up to bed. I'll see you in the morning, all right? Come in. May I talk to you for just a minute? Yes. Alexei, why? I mean about us. There has to be an answer. - There is an answer, Kate, you just have to believe me. - But Alexei, I see more of Neil than I see of you. Listen, Kate, Neil is your friend. You wanted him to live here and I agreed to it because I know I'm often away. - I know it was my idea, but he's always with me, just the way that there are guards in front of this house all the time. Alexei, can't you understand? I don't want Neil. I want you. Oh, Alexei, please love me. Please be a husband to me. Oh, for God's sake, make love to me. Alexei, do you remember what you said when you told me how you'd like things to be between us? - It isn't a question of what I would like. - You did say it wasn't something you wanted, that's true, but... The hardest thing is not knowing how long it's going to go on like this. You began by saying that it could go on for weeks or even months, but, Alexei, as of tonight it's been five months. Can't you tell me anything? Has anything changed? Is anything going to change? I don't know! I'm doing my best to find out. What more can I say? Nothing. {Alexei] Gavin. Dr. Abarnel. How was your flight? Oh, not too bad. I'm glad you're finally here. What's the matter? Things are looking bad. Several corpses have washed down the river since Rhav left. Have you heard anything from her? Nothing for two days. {Alexei] What do you think has happened? I have something in the basement you had better take a look at. It will give you some idea. She's so young. - Except for one old woman, they were all young girls, tethered together in twos and threes by a thin leather cord, run through a hole cut through the heel of the right foot. Most of them were also sexually mutilated. Oh, my God. How long has she been dead? - All of the streams coming out of the hills run very fast, so she hadn't been in the water more than 24 hours. - A zodiacal configuration like Kajerste's is one thing on a computer screen, but it's quite a different matter when you see it like this. It's like Hitler. No one could have done what he did. But he did it. I wonder what her zodiacal potential was. Do you think we'll hear from Rhav soon? I don't know. We'll just have to wait. Oho! We were worried. This is quite a greeting. I'm glad you're okay. Here, let me take that. Can I help? I've got it. Hello, Rhav. Oh, it's good to see you. Have you seen the bodies yet? Yes, we have. What's going on up there? They're running out of food. I have the details on my tape. Can we hear it? Let me clean up first, I... I'll tell you about it later. Did my equipment arrive yet? I had it put on a Royal Air Force jet. It should be in New Delhi by morning and trucked out here by tomorrow afternoon. What are you going to do with the TV stuff? - Are any of you familiar with Titum Varnen's work on non-sensory perception? - You mean feeding video images directly into the brain via electrodes without using the eyes? Yes. It was originally developed with the hope that someday it might enable people whose eyes and ears have been damaged to see or hear by putting stimulus directly into the brain using video cameras, microphones, and electrodes. Has it been perfected? To some extent, yes. The major problem seems to be that the brain becomes confused by such direct stimulation, so the images and sounds tend to seem more like dreams than reality. But for our purposes, that should work fine. {Joe] What's going on around here? Who are all these people? We're gonna make a videotape using that actor, who we're making up to look like Kajerste. The videotape is designed to show Kajerste how to work his followers into a frenzy by standing in front of them with a fake terrum dagger and cutting himself. And at the same time telling them that he and those who follow him are immune to the terrum poison. After we finish the videotape, we're going to play it through electrodes, which we'll temporarily glue to Kajerste's skull. To do this, we have to sneak into his camp late at night and without waking him up, anesthetize him with a tranquilizer dart. If he wakes up, it won't work. With any luck, he'll confuse the videotape with the day's real events. In the morning, he'll try to act them out. Only instead of using a prop, he'll be using a real terrum knife dipped in real poison that we will have left behind. Why don't you let me come with you? You okay up there? Fine. Kahoor is just around the bend. Oh, my God. Is that all that's left of Kahoor? I've seen films of this a couple of weeks ago at Interzod headquarters. I hadn't realized it was so devastated. - Isn't this a lovely spot to have a picnic? Guess I could work up an appetite. - I think we should eat before we move in on Kajerste. Is all of your work so exciting? No. Most of it's quite routine. Giving someone a flat tire so they miss a plane, breaking a diplomat's leg, setting up a volunteer ambulance course so some overly organizational type with an ego problem will have something to do. It's not everyday I have to precipitate a gas shortage or a stock market crash. You serious? Rarely. Shh! Sorry. I'm going in. You stay here and keep me covered. If I'm not out in 12 minutes, get the hell out of here and don't be afraid to use your gun. But... Do you really think Alexei believes that a tribal outlaw with a few followers is going to take over the world? You were used, Rhav. This has nothing to do with India. This has nothing to do with Interzod as well. It's a child, Rhav. The child waiting to be born. Child? Waiting? Stay with me forever, Rhav. Stay with me. Rhav! No! No! No! No! No! As of tonight it's been five months. For God's sake, make love to me. Uh, hello? {Man] New York surveillance lost Kate. It could be bad. You'd better come back. What is your hurry so late at night? I'm sorry, I just have to catch a plane and I'm really late. I'm sorry. Did you find Kajerste? - How do you know I was looking for Kajerste? The sky told me. Just like when he was born. The sky tells when something is happening. - What do you mean just like when he was born? He was born July 31, 1949 in Bombay. That was a sunny day. Kajerste was not born in Bombay. He was born on a mountain at midnight in a storm. Please, cut the cards. Give me your hand. You! Get out of here! I told you to stay away from her! Get out! Get out! Forgive me. I'm very sorry. This is outrageous. It will not happen again. Something has gotten into him. - That's all right, I'm sure he meant no harm. - Uh... - He is not himself. Here, please, take this. No, no, you must not give me anything. Take it with you! You must never come back here again. You must let me follow her. I have to. She has money. Money! With her money you could buy yourself a place in hell. I'm going to follow her! I will kill you if you try! Forgive me for what I must do. Please, forgive me. {Alexei] All right, Neil, what happened? Well, I'm not sure. We went to New York shopping Friday morning. We were supposed to meet later for lunch and go to a matinee and she didn't show up. I went back to the car. There was a note on the seat. She said everything was fine, she'd be back in a few days. Not to worry or tell you. She figured you wouldn't be back by then anyway. Voice check, Abarnel. Yeah, get me the New York office and get the jet ready to go there. Are you from the precinct? You are not on the squad. I know the squad. I'm not from the squad or the precinct. I'm not a police officer. My name is Alexei Abarnel. I'm an astrologer. - You do not look to me like an astrologer. You do not have the eyes or the hands of an astrologer. I don't suppose I do, but I don't see it should matter very much, do you? What do you want? I want to ask you about my wife. You know her. I have to know what was said when she came to see you. Something I'm ready to pay for. It cannot be done. I know it can be done. It would be for her own good. What are you to her? Her husband? What is that to her that I should tell you anything? I am her husband. But I'm more than that, more than she knows about. I'm protecting her for what I know her to be. No. How do you know? She could not tell you. She didn't tell me. And it's true, she couldn't, because she doesn't know. But I know. You know? You have the gift? No. No one has the gift. I know because I studied and I figured it out. Now I want you to tell me how you knew about her, what you told her, and where she is! Don't trifle with me. I tell you I have seen and understood. I had the gift the day she came to see me. I hadn't had it for nearly a year, but I had it that day as soon as she walked into the room. Do you know what it is like? It is to be suddenly blinded by what you know. There is nothing else at all except the knowing. When I saw her, I understood that I had known her forever. Even in the years when she and I were not alive. Do you understand me? I have known her longer than I have lived. What did you tell her? Tell her? I told her nothing. Does she know? Know? What do any of us know about ourselves? No one has the gift for that. - Have you ever seen a graph of the Virgin Mary's zodiacal potential? Mm-mm. It's a pure universal constant. Destined to immaculately conceive a child with infinite positive potential, Wembley, caused by a zodiacal configuration so rare it has only occurred twice. Twice? Twice, Wembley. Once on the exact birthdate of the Virgin Mary, a date which you so painstakingly discovered after years of research. And for a second time on July 24, 1953 in the town of Winchester, Virginia. So Kate has the same zodiacal potential as the Virgin Mary? It's funny. Even I can't predict when the child will be born. I've scanned every astrological configuration from the day I met her through the next 100 years. Nothing, nothing of that magnitude. I can only guess that Kate will never have children or that she will give birth under some freak unpredictable cosmic circumstance, such as the star of Bethlehem suddenly glowing brighter was almost 2000 years ago. - How long have you known about this, Alexei? - I couldn't be sure until you finished your work, but I've suspected it for a long time. {Robert] Before you married her? Before I met her. I had to know the truth about the virgin birth. That's why I couldn't sleep with her. It was the only way. That's a hell of a thing, Alexei. But you love her, don't you? Yes. That only makes it harder. That's my cross to bear. Oh, well, don't worry, Alexei. Kate will be here soon. It'll be all right. It's not just that. Something else is bothering me. Do you suppose we could have Kajerste's birthdate wrong? - This whole experience has unnerved you, Alexei. What if Kajerste weren't born in Bombay, but on a mountain? A mountain? Huh, that's funny. Last week, Yanakov came up with something extremely interesting. The zP of a person born on Kantun Peak in the Himalayan Mountains on July 31, 1949 would have an ungraphable potential. It would be infinitely negative. Worse than anything we've ever known. But on that same day in 1949, there was such a terrible blizzard on Kantun Peak that even if a child had been born there, it couldn't possibly have survived. Voice check, Wembley. {Man] We've found Kate. She's in a gypsy encampment in upstate New York. We're on our way. Kate? Kate? Come on, Kate. It's time to go home. Oh, Alexei, I'm so sorry! Don't be, it's my fault. I asked you to put up with something nobody could be expected to accept. Kate, there's one thing I still have to ask you. You're not still a virgin, are you? Alexei... I haven't been a virgin since I was 16. I gave birth to a child in a Catholic home for unwed mothers. I didn't know who the father was, so the baby was put up for adoption. Sister Mary Elizabeth? Yes. I'm Robert Wembley. I've been expecting you. On September 14, 1969, a young girl named Kathleen Dougherty gave birth to a baby that was placed in an orphanage where you worked. We must find that child. That's impossible. I thought Cardinal Clark phoned to ask you to cooperate with us. - It wouldn't matter if the Pope himself called. The records don't exist. Only the Lord can help you find that child. Good morning, Alexei. Good morning. How did you sleep? Very well. Alexei... I'm sorry I never told you about my baby. Does it make any difference to you? No. After I had the baby, I couldn't think about anything else for months. I never even made up my mind what to do until just before the baby came. Every time I thought about keeping it and bringing it up myself, I had to admit I couldn't do a very good job. Anyway, it would've been terrible for the child to grow up never knowing who his father was and maybe one day realizing that even I didn't know. You never saw your baby, did you? No. When I woke up after the ether I was already in the recovery room. I remember there was a sister sitting by my bed, holding my hand. That was the hardest part, Alexei. She wouldn't even let me talk about it. She would only tell me it was a normal birth. I remember asking her if he was beautiful. She just smiled and turned away from me. If he was beautiful? Did she say it was a boy? No, not really. I suppose it could've been a girl. Why did you go there to have your baby? I mean to the Catholic home. - I don't know, it just seemed like the best thing to do. I didn't have much of a choice, you know. There was the county hospital, but if I had gone there, I would have had to wait till just before the baby was born. The sisters took me in in my fifth or sixth month. That made all the difference. But then you'd have to understand Winchester to know that. It's just no place for an unmarried, pregnant teenage girl. It would have been hard for me to stay there any longer than I did. Besides, if I had gone to the county hospital, I would have had to answer a lot of questions from the social workers, things I really didn't want to talk about. The sisters were more tactful. They didn't even ask who the father was. They only asked me if I'd like to tell them. There's a difference. Did you tell them? - I told them I didn't know who the father was. Alexei, I'm going to tell you this because for a long time you asked me to trust you and you never explained why and you even asked me not to look for an explanation. It was very hard to do, but I did it. Now it's your turn to trust me and all I ask is that you don't laugh at me or look superior or maybe even think I'm crazy. I even want you to try to believe me. I honestly didn't do anything with a boy that could have possibly gotten me pregnant. It was awful, everybody kept asking me questions. I finally agreed to go to a doctor because I thought he would tell them I wasn't. But all he told me was that I obviously felt so guilty about it that I was blocking it from my mind. I knew he was wrong. But I saw right then that it would be easier just to tell everyone I simply didn't know who the father was. That was something they were willing to believe. Alexei, do you believe me? I believe you, Kate. Oh, do you mean it or do you mean you'll just try to believe it? No, I know you're telling the truth. Do you remember when you gave birth? I tried not to remember. Sometimes when I look back, I wonder if maybe it wasn't all just a dream. The whole time I was pregnant I never had a due date firmly fixed. The doctors could never agree on how long I'd carried. I couldn't help them. I couldn't even remember when I'd first missed a period. I simply wasn't thinking about being pregnant. It was as if nothing had happened. Nothing at all. {Child] Come on! Hey, I'm gonna get you! Not so fast! {Child] And I'm gonna get you! {Child] Not so fast! - {Child] You can't catch me, you can't catch me!
