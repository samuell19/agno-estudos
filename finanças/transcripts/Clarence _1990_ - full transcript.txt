[music playing] Thank you. Joseph! This can't be true. There must be someone you can send. There's nobody, Jeremy. Joseph, please. The way the world is these days, all our guardian angels working overtime as it is. We don't have a single one to spare. Well, what about Clarence Odbody? He's a guardian angel and he's available. Well, yeah. He's available. That's true. Well? I'd love to send him, but he'd never go. Why not? JOSEPH (VOICEOVER): Clarence used to be one of our finest angels. He did a sterling job in Bedford Falls for a man named George Bailey. But the last time down, well, he made a bit of a mess of things. He's refused every assignment since, even though it means he won't get any younger. Well then, there must be something you could do to make him go. You can't make someone do something he doesn't want to do. [music playing] Unless-- Clarence? Jeremy. I wasn't expecting anyone. What brings you here? It's Rachel, my wife on earth. She's in real trouble. And Joseph says there aren't any guardian angels available to help her. Oh, Jeremy, no. Yes. I mean, I'd go down myself to straighten things out if I could, but I don't have my wings. I was hoping you could help. Clarence, you've got your wings. You've done this sort of thing before. Believe me, Jeremy. For your own good, you don't want me to do this. Oh, Clarence, come on. I know that if you could just see how beautiful my family is, you'd-- look, look, there's Rachel, and Brent, and my little pumpkin Casey. Oh, Clarence, we had such a wonderful life. I never realized it at the time. JEREMY (VOICEOVER): Come on, Rachel, this isn't fair. RACHEL: Not till I'm finished. JEREMY: Please. Ricky. Ricky. RACHEL: All right. Are you ready? I call him Dexter. Is that supposed to be me? Oh, well, sure. I mean, look at those eyes, they're kind and gentle, just like yours. Look at that jaw line, it's honest and strong, just like you. Yeah, but he's-- he's not much to look at, is he? Oh. Well. Oh, you will pay for that. Marry me, Ricky. I know it's sudden and probably crazy, but you just have to. Well, what do you say? So we got married. And Rachel wrote a children's book using Dexter. And it was such a hit that we built a business around it. Looks good, Jeremy. All right, yeah, keep crunching. Good stuff. Hey, Greg. How's the homework going? Oh, all right. This program's awfully slow. Huh? Well, might be a lot faster if you do something like this. Faster? Are you kidding? You'd have to convert the whole file. Wanna bet? Oh, I'll beat you this time. Oh, the winner and still champ. I'm never going to beat you. I'll never be good enough. Hey, now if I thought like that, we never would have got this company started. You gotta have faith. It's what keeps the dreamers dreaming and the doers doing. You know, I've had this silver dollar since I was about your age. I want you to have it. If you ever start to doubt yourself, it'll remind you to have faith. Promise me you won't forget all this, huh? Come on, son, promise. OK, Dad, I promise. Attaboy. Jeremy Casson on line one. Mr. Casson, did you read our computer game proposal? Yup. Well, I don't care what Brimmer says. He doesn't have our technology and we're not selling it to him. This is about more than money. Now, now Mr. Casson, I know you have kids just like I do. Do you want to fill them with the sort of garbage that Brimmer is peddling or with something that makes a difference? Thank you, sir. I promise you won't regret this. Thank you. [cheering] JEREMY (VOICEOVER): Everything seemed so perfect. What could possibly have gone wrong? I had a heart attack that very day. Overworking. I never even got to say goodbye, never got to tell them how much I love them. Clarence, my family is in trouble now. Rachel's set to get in a cab today at the corner of 3rd and Main. And that cab ride will set off a chain of events that will ultimately lead to her suicide. What? That's all I know. But all you have to do to break that chain is to stop her from getting in that cab. Well, that sounds simple enough. And a good deed like that would help me get younger again. Oh, but the last time-- I don't know, Jeremy. Maybe, maybe you could let me think about this for a couple of weeks. I'll get back to you. Clarence, there's no time. Rachel is going to get in that cab today at 10 to 3. That's in 10 minutes. 10 minutes? That's why you've got to go now, Clarence. Please. All you've got to do is stop her from getting in that cab. Oh, dear. Well, it looks like it worked. I hope so. [traffic noise] Thank you. [bell ringing] Hey, Mister! Mister! Stop! Thief! Hold it right there. Hey, you dropped this. Oh, thanks. You know, I wouldn't normally say this, but that hat, it really doesn't do you justice. Mister, you were great. You just stopped that creep from taking my whole week's take. I did? Yeah, you stepped in just in the nick of time. Time! Ah! - Wait. Hey, hey, hey, he just took my money. Who? Him! Stop, thief! Stop! Stop the cab. You gotta get out of the cab. Why Because you just have to. You know this jerk? No, I don't think so. Please. Please just get out of the cab. Get your own cab. Yeah, yeah. Don't tell me. You want me to follow that cab, right? Yes, yes! How did you know that? Hey, I watch old movies. OK, come on. Go, go, go, go, go! So what's the deal? Well, I'm supposed to stop the lady from getting in that cab to break the chain. But I didn't stop her, so now the chain isn't broken, which means-- well, actually, I don't know what that means. It's just that something awful is going to happen to her if I don't stop her from doing whatever it is she's about to do. But I guess I shouldn't be telling you this, should I? Uh, no, probably not. Rachel! Rachel, stop! Stop! Hey, yo, you didn't pay me yet. [sirens blaring] - Stop! - Hold on, guy. Wait. You don't understand. I have to help her. - Don't worry. She'll get some help. From so will you. It's going to be too late. Too late for what? Pay up, ya bum! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Let him go. He's a good guy. Yeah, look at that. Hey, that bum stole my money. Hey, don't you call my pal a bum, you jerk. Who you calling a jerk? Give this-- [interposing voices] Come on. Come on. - Whoa! - Hey, give me that. That's my cab fare. This is my money. Come on, come on, come on, break it up, break it up. Don't worry, Mrs. Logan. Dexter will be well taken care of, I can assure you. Rachel! Rachel, don't do it. Ricky! [music playing] Who is this man? Get him, he's got the contract. Get him. - --cab fare. - Cab fare? - Get him. He's got the contract. I wanna know what's going on here. Get him! Somebody get under there and get him. He's eating it. Pull him out of there. Pull him out of-- No. [interposing voices] You got a right to a lawyer. You can't afford one, one will be appointed for you. Lawyer? Lawyer. Oh, where I come from, we don't see too many of this. Well, well, well. Isn't this a nice surprise? Oh, dear. I'm sorry what I said about your hat. Sorry about that. Odbody, you made bail. Good afternoon, Officer. You, um, you called me Ricki in the boardroom today. Oh, yeah, I guess I did. That was my husband's pet name for me. How'd you know it? Well, you could say I'm a-- I mean I was a very good friend of his. Clarence Odbody. Oh. It's funny, I don't remember Jeremy ever mentioning you. You must be from his hometown up in Wisconsin. Well, you could say I'm from a bit further up than that. You know, actually he talked quite a bit about you. Oh. You know, you nearly scared the daylights out of me today. Oh, yeah, I guess I did. I'm sorry. No. Actually you prevented me from making a very big mistake. Thank you. It's nothing. Well, I should be getting home to my kids. Can I drop you off somewhere? Oh, gosh, it's-- You do have a place to stay, don't you? Well, actually, I sort of flew in today, and I haven't really given it much thought. Well, you don't have to. You can stay with us. After all, any friend of Jeremy's is a friend of mine. I just couldn't. I mean, I wouldn't want-- I mean, I think it's a lovely idea. Thank you. [music playing] Great. I'm hoping for a check and all I get are bills, bills, and more bills. It's going to be some Christmas without any presents. Well, I'm sure things will get better, Rachel. You sound just like Jeremy, the eternal optimist. Mommy, Mommy, you're home. Hi, sweetheart. Hi. This is Clarence. Hi. He was a friend of your father's. You were? Did he ever talk about me? No. Well, not unless you're his little pumpkin. That's me, that's me. Did you have fun today? Yeah, but it would have been more fun if you'd seen our play. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. I was so busy I completely forgot. That's OK. You must have had a good enough reason for it. I have a surprise for you. You do? Yeah. Because you were late, I thought I'd make dinner for us, tuna casserole. I couldn't find the tuna so I used sardines. You're not mad, are you, Mom? No, honey. But where is your brother? Somewhere. Brent! Brent! I would say this is the best tuna casserole I've had, well, in decades. We have it a lot now. If you think about it, it's cheaper. Casey. So how was school today, Brent? Fine. How was that English test? OK. Did you get your homework done? I tried to. What do you mean you tried to? I just can't concentrate. Well, you don't seem to have any problem concentrating on the video games. You know, Brent, I've had a very long day and once it would be nice to come home and find out you actually put some effort into-- where are you going? To do my homework. Brent, you come back here. Brent! [music playing] I'm sorry. I just don't know what's happening to him. Well, sometimes when something bad happens, you feel like giving up. And you don't want to, but you just can't help it. It can happen to anybody, Rachel. Yeah. I think we just all miss Dad a lot. We're ready, Mr. Brimmer. OK, here we go. Zedron, fire. What? Zedron, fire. Zedron. OK, that's all. That's all with the Zedron, OK? That was very impressive, Barkley. I hope you show just as much imagination on your next job search. Rachel Logan's still [inaudible].. Well then, this is ridiculous, isn't it? I mean, why am I sitting here? This is an exercise in futility, is it not? I'm up to my ears in expensive programmers. She's got one, one measly program. And the woman is miles ahead of us on this thing. I'm going to tell you something, if she figures a way to make that voice activator work before I do, I'm going to be ruined. You understand that? [music playing] Well, well, well. Surprised to see me, Clarence? Goodness. Joseph, thank God you're here. I think I'm messing up again. I mean, all I was supposed to do was come down here and stop a woman from getting in a cab. Sounds simple, right? Well, I thought so, too. But then there was this guy in a funny hat, only it really wasn't a hat at all. And I messed up. And she got in that cab, and then I didn't break the chain of events. Or did I? I don't know. I don't know what I should do. Mm. I see. That is a problem. Tell you what, this isn't your responsibility. Why don't you just forget the whole thing and come back with me? Oh, could I, Joseph? That would be so wonderful. Sure. I'm sure Rachel Logan will be able to survive on her own. So if you're ready to go-- Wait a second. Are you saying that if I leave that family won't get any help? There's no one left to send, Clarence. But that's not your concern. You mean no help at all. Joseph? Yes, Clarence? Well, what if-- what if I was her guardian angel? You? Yeah. Yow want to try being a guardian angel again? Yeah. But what about your precious clocks? Well, clocks aren't people, Joseph. You realize, being a guardian angel isn't easy, Clarence? You can guide, suggest, or help her to make the right decisions. But ultimately. The choice she makes must be her own. And Clarence, the rules have changed since you were down the last time. You can't let anyone know what you are anymore. You mustn't cross the barrier between heaven and earth. You do, and you lose your wings and be stuck down here. I won't let you down this time, Joseph. I promise. Well, I've got some work to do. What are you doing? I'm just fixing the picture. Clarence, your power is not to be used for house cleaning. Joseph? Joseph! Oh, darling, you don't seem to be running a temperature. Maybe I should go to school. [coughs] No. I think you better stay at home. But I don't know what I'm going to do about getting you a sitter. Clarence could look after me. I don't mind. It'll help me earn my keep. Well, it would be a great help. All right. I'll check on you later. Have a good day at school, Brent. Brent? [music playing] Eh. Not an elf. Nah. Not a griffin. Although angels make take many different forms, there is the simple way of identifying one. An angel cannot lie. This is a fascinating thing, isn't it? It's just a vacuum cleaner. Well, where I come from, you don't see these too much. Where are you from, Clarence? I was born in Boston. When? A long time ago. Where do you live now? Well, it seems like I'm living here now. Well, when you leave here, where will you go? Well, it all depends what happens here. Have you ever been to heaven? Yes. Many times. - You have? - Yes. Every time I see a smile like yours, that's heaven to me. [music playing] I brought the loan agreement like you asked, Mr. Brimmer. But frankly, I'm a little confused about all of this. Well, then let me come to the point. Rachel Logan owes you $50,000. I understand she's in arrears. Well, the Logans have always been a reliable client, sir. I'm sure the loan will be Yeah, I'm sure. What if I was to make you an offer to buy back that loan, at say, double its value? Why would you want to do that, sir? I have my reasons, Mr. Maxwell. Shall we say $100,000 in cash? RADIO ANNOUNCER: Now recapping the forecast. Clear skies will continue through today and tomorrow. A very defective machine. RADIO ANNOUNCER: --snow flurries are expected later in the week. CASEY (VOICEOVER): Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings. [music playing] [bell ringing] Do you want some soup? No? Oh, dear. Doesn't this do anything for you? Well, it sort of irritates me a little bit. Come on, move it. We've got all day here. Dad used to always come and watch Brent play football. There's Brent there. Blue 22. Down, set, fight, fight, fight. That's not nice. Come on, jerk, what's the matter? Logan. Hit the showers. Now zone defense, guys. Brent. Brent, you cut my class again today. I'm afraid I'm going to have to give your mother a call. Now listen, I understand things are difficult at home. But if you have any chance of getting through the year-- I apologize for butting in, but I couldn't help overhearing. Who are you? I'm a friend of the family's. Now I know you don't want to make things any tougher for this family than they already are. Of course I don't. I can't just let him cut classes whenever he feels like it. Perhaps I could personally guarantee that Brent won't miss any more classes. OK. But if he misses one more class, I'll have to take action, and that'll mean suspension. Don't worry, Brent won't miss another class. He better not. Now Brent, you can't keep doing this. You're not my father. What do you care? I care because what you're doing is hurting your mother. And she's already got enough stress without having to worry about you at school. So what am I supposed to do? Why don't you try being more responsible? Brent. You know you are the man of the house now. I think it's about time you acted like it. All right? [music playing] How are you going to make Brent go to his classes? Well, Casey, I don't know yet. But I'll think of something. You know, Clarence, you're pretty good at saying things to fix stuff up. - Yeah. I guess I'm on bit of a roll, aren't I? This is going to be easier than I thought. Hey. What are you two doing here? I wanted Clarence to meet Dexter. Oh. You're feeling better now. Oh, yes, much better. So this is your office, Rachel? Well, what's left of it. Hi, Casey. Hi, Bert. Bert, this is Clarence Odbody, a good friend of Jeremy's. How do you do? How do you do? Bert was our first employee, one of the best computer men in the business. I don't know where we'd be without him. These are very interesting things here, Bert. It's just your basic PC. But using Jeremy's notes here, we hope to develop a system which will allow you to communicate with the characters on the screen. So you'll actually be able to talk to them? Sure. [computer generated music] Hello, Dexter. How are you? [computer garbled voice] That's really great, Bert. No, you see, that's our problem. We can make them respond, but it's gibberish. Oh. We're just that far away from getting him to speak clearly. And when you do? Oh, well, when we do-- Jeremy believed that if you use this technology correctly, you can educate kids, as well as entertain them. So kids really like these games. Casey? Bye, Dexter. [computer garbled voice] Rachel, can I speak to you for a minute? I don't know how much longer I can last without some pay. I know. Do you think you could just hang on until Thursday after the trade show? You know, it's bound to improve our situation. Hello, Rachel. Looks like business is really booming. Obviously enough to get you over here, Mr. Brimmer. Please, call me Harold, now that we're going to be working together. Hello, Bert. How are you? I'm good. I thought I told you I changed my mind on that. Well, you have nothing to do with it anymore, dear. Do you recognize this document at all? How'd you get this? I own that. That is a contract which very clearly states that I am now your creditor. And unless you pay me in full by the end of the week, I would be forced to foreclose. I'm entitled. However, I would be extremely low to do such a thing to you, Rachel. So why don't I just suggest this little business proposition to you? Why don't you sell me the company now? You can't do that. You know this lunatic? I would only be a lunatic if I let you destroy this wonderful little company. Rachel Logan and I will not lie down and play dead just like that. No, sirree. - Clarence. If you think we've begun to fight, you haven't seen anything yet. You're going to have to drag us out of here kicking and screaming. So there. All right. I will expect that $50,000 by the end of the week. I had a hat. You're sitting on it. [music playing] Clarence, what did you just do? Well, I couldn't let you sell the company. Why not? Because you've worked so hard on it. Clarence, I have no choice. Sure you do. No, he's got me. I may be no financial genius, but it sure seems to me all he's got is your loan. Why don't you just get another one? Way to go, Clarence. RADIO ANNOUNCER: Enjoy the sunshine while you can. Those mild temperatures will give way to snow and blowing snow by the end of the week. What are you doing? Oh, organizing financial records for the bank. If we're going to get this loan, they're going to want to know everything. The problem is, I don't know how I'm going to get all this done and get to work on time. I could do it for you. Oh, I don't know, Clarence. It's pretty complicated. Hey. Well, all right. You enter these documents in the computer there. Thanks. Get myself dressed for work. [music playing] Remarkable machines, aren't they? Yeah. They sure have a lot of buttons. OK. What are you trying to do? Your mother mentioned something about entering these documents. I don't see anyplace to enter them. She meant in the memory. But there's an easier way to do that. Just feed them into the fax machine. It'll scan them and enter them automatically. OK. You're really something on these things, aren't you? Well, my dad taught me a lot. He must have been pretty good. The best. I remember we used to have these races to see who could solve computer problems first. I remember this one-- well, actually, I should really be going, because I don't want to be late today. All right. That's the spirit. Later, dude. See you, Case. I guess my little speech really did the trick. He's got a whole new attitude about school. Clarence, he's not going to school. What makes you think that? You said he should be the man of the house now. So he's going to look for a job. That's not what I meant. If he misses another class-- Clarence. Clarence. You really are on a roll, aren't you? Funny how those quick fixes never seem to last very long. Actually, it's not very funny at all. But Joseph, I know I can handle it. I'm sure you can, Clarence. But whatever you do, just don't reveal the fact that you're-- Brent! Oh, dear. Clarence, have you seen Brent? Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Sorry, Joseph. Fax machine. Mommy? I've got something to tell you. What, honey? Well, Brent-- Brent! Brent. Brent, your lunch. Oh, thanks, Rachel. Ah, Mother. Mom. Later, dude. Don't overdo it, Clarence. You're a fraud. That's what you are. Well-- How they all took on. They crowded around the doctor and tried to explain to him that Harvey had showed them 40 different ways that he was Harvey, and begged and begged him not to hurt Harvey's feelings or the poor girl's feelings and all that, Mr. Logan. Mr. Logan. And I thought we were going to miss the pleasure of your company today. How kind of you to join us. Well, think nothing of it. - Logan. - Yes? Yes, sir. You don't have to call me sir. [laughter] - Quiet. So you think you're pretty smart, huh? Well, let's see how smart you really are. Why don't you tell us about your homework for today, Brent? I really don't think I should do that. Oh, I think you should, unless you want to get into serious trouble. Well, I just wouldn't know where to start. How about the subject under discussion for today? Huckleberry Finn. Oh, Huck Finn. You mean Sam Clemens' book? You know, his real name was Samuel Langhorne Clemens. Mark Twain was a name that he picked up on the Mississippi River. In riverboat jargon, it means no immediate danger or reason to be wary. Very informative, Logan. Have you read the book? - Oh, yeah. Several times. It's one of my favorites. Great. Well, perhaps you'd like to tell us about Huckleberry Finn as a satire on institutionalism. Well, I suppose Tom, Jim and Huck could represent three levels of civilization. Tom is ruled mostly by his books, and Jim is governed by his taboos and his superstitions, and Huck, Huck really is the only one that's truly free of institutions. Shall I go on? [music playing] Well, because Huck-- Care for a claw? No. No, thanks. I'm sure that you're very aware of my status in your bank. I'm a much more valuable customer than, shall we say, someone like Rachel Logan and her petty account. How do you know about Mrs. Logan? You sure you don't want something? A little leg? No. It's my business to know these things. Anyway, I think we understand each other. N'est pas? [bell rings] Brent, you were amazing in there. I thought old man Scully was going to croak. You were great. It was nothing, really. Brent. Fantastic. See you at football practice, huh? Football? Red, 43. Red, 43. Down, set, fight, fight, fight. No, the other way. That's better. [interposing voices] [whistle blowing] OK. Hello? I'm home, everybody. Clarence? Got great news from the bank. Hope you didn't have any trouble getting those documents ready. As a matter of fact, I just finished. Great. Rachel, this cake is wonderful. What is it? Rachel? Cake. Oh, it's devil's food cake. Want some more? No, thanks, Casey, I'm full. [knocking at door] Oh, Harry. Come on in. What brings you here? Oh, little Brent left his books at school today. I guess you heard what happened. No. Brent tells me very little these days. Oh, well, it was amazing. He aced English and was an absolute star on the football field. Brent. That's wonderful. Thank you, Casey. This was my dad's suit. Ow. Work with me, Clarence. Work with me. Well, it's not supposed to hurt, Casey. Now Clarence, how are you going to impress the people at the bank unless you look good? You're just lucky my dad's suit fits you so well. Are you OK, Mom? Oh. Yes, I'm fine, Casey. So what do you think? Very nice. Yeah, you look like a hunk. A hunk of what? Are you sure you need me? Because I'm not really very good at these sorts of things. Don't worry. It'll be all right. Yes, well, Mrs. Logan, your records are fine. But what I'd really like to do is hear from your new partner. Clarence? Me? Yes. Mrs. Logan has assured us that you've had considerable experience. In what? You'll have to excuse Clarence. He's got a great sense of humor. Yes. Clarence, tell them about your banking experience. Well, I've been with Rockefeller and Morgan. Really? What have you been doing recently? I've been with a very large organization. In what capacity? Clarence? Time management. At what level? It was very high up. Corporate executive. Well, Mr. Odbody, the case in point here is Dexter Software. What is your business plan for this company? Well, I suppose it's like a clock. A clock, Mr. Odbody? Yes. You see, if a clock breaks, you don't throw it out. Because usually it's just a very small part of it that's gone wrong. And once it's fixed, you have a perfectly good clock again. Yes. Well, I think I get your point, Mr. Odbody. I'm inclined to grant you your loan. However, we'll need to see some sales commitments from your trade show first, say 50,000 units? 50,000? But that's impossible. Nobody could possibly sell that many. I'm sorry. But those are the conditions. Excuse me, sir, sir, sir. [inaudible] Sorry. Didn't mean to bother you. You believe the stuff they're giving away down there? That is some spread they have. So what are you guys giving away? Well-- So how's it going? I don't think it's going well. I'm not cut out for sales. [inaudible]. I scheduled our presentation to coincide with the auditor's speech this afternoon. We should get a few people then. [computer generated music] What is this? That's not Dexter. What are we going to do? I don't know. But don't move. [inaudible] is always better at talking us out of trouble than I ever was. Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Do you see that? Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever seen? I am truly sorry that you have to witness that. But you have to. That is not just a cartoon character up there. That's you and you and you and you. Dexter is what is good in all of us. And I mean, look at him, full of hatred and cruelty. And why? Because some people want to make him that way. But there's an alternative, an alternative in which our children can actually talk to Dexter and learn from him. Now do you want to fill your kids with garbage that some people are peddling here, or do you want to try something new, something that will make a difference? You, sir, do you have any children? Yes. Two. Well, is this the kind of stuff that you want to expose them to day after day? Because that's what's going to happen unless you make a difference. Now you might make more money selling Brimmer games, but you're not going to make better kids. So what are we going to do? I guess I could take 100 units. 100? All right, 200. I'll take 1,000. I'll take 500. [interposing voices] [applause] All right. Now listen up. Tomorrow is the dawning of a new era for our football team at Western. We're going to make people notice us. Hey, man, I thought I was starting at full back. Full back goes to our new secret weapon, Brent Logan. [cheering] - Hi, Brent. - Hi. Saw you at football practice yesterday. Great moves. See you tomorrow, OK? Hey, old buddy, old pal. How's the star doing? Excuse me, this is Brent Logan, the Brent Logan, personal friend of mine. Larry, is this some kind of a joke? Joke? Yeah, telling everybody how great I was yesterday. You were great. Larry, I wasn't here yesterday. Speaking of jokers. And they say heroes don't have a sense of humor. Hey, hope you don't forget us little people, huh? You were amazing today. Rachel-- Don't be so modest, Clarence. You were an absolute angel. You know, you really are a remarkable man. You show up out of nowhere, when things couldn't possibly be any worse. And all of a sudden, my business starts turning around and my son starts improving in school, and my whole life seems-- well-- If any family deserved a break, it's yours. And it hasn't been easy on Brent and Casey, either. You really do like my kids, don't you? Most ordinary single men don't cherish the idea of children. I'll tell you, Clarence, it hasn't been easy. But with things being the way they are, a lot of crazy thoughts go through your head, you know? Anyway, I don't think I'll be having them anymore. And it's your doing. Thank you, Clarence. You're welcome, Rachel. Oh, dear. JOSEPH: She's falling in love with you, Clarence. Well, actually, she's probably just confusing me with Jeremy. Well, maybe. And why not? You are her new miracle man. You just use your little tricks and, poof, all her troubles are gone. Her documents, the convention, Brent's problems at school. Oh, you caught that one, did you? I seem to recall going over this with you, Clarence. You can't just fix the circumstances in Rachel's life. You have to deal with the core of the problem. Well, I'll certainly remember that for the next. Uh-uh. This time. Now you correct what you've done. Or I will. Clarence, we are going to need that golden tongue of yours again today. You see, what these people promised is one thing. What they're willing to commit to is another. Well, if I have to. Really, Clarence? Here we go. Got my money. I want you to make sure I got my order in before you ran out. Oh, you didn't have to worry about that. We haven't sold a single one yet. That's not to say it's not a wonderful game, or at least it will be if we can ever make it work. What? Well, son. We're ready to sign on the dotted line. You remember the wife, don't you? Oh, yes. Hi, Fatty. Patty, I meant Patty. Definitely not Fatty, because you're certainly not a fat woman. I mean, well, even if you were, which of course I'm not saying that you are, I would think that you still look very slim, in spite of your bulk. Come on, honey, let's go. We don't have to take this abuse. Clarence, what has happened to you? Cassum was our biggest client. Rachel, I'm sorry. I just, I keep saying the wrong thing. Well, you better start saying the right thing before we lose them all. Rachel, I can't. Clarence, you have to. And so the main theme of Huckleberry Finn is the growth of an individual personality. Now I thought I'd let Brent expand on the major crisis of the novel, the moral decision to go against the conventions of society. Brent? Me? Come on, now, Brent, don't be shy. But, sir, I really don't know anything about that. Yes, you do. You proved that last class. Now come on. Sir, I really don't. Logan, I'm losing my patience. All right, if that's the way you want it, you can take your insolent attitude elsewhere. I won't stand for it in my classroom any longer! Everybody, could you listen up, please? Rachel Logan and I are very glad to see you today. It's very rare to find people kind enough and brave enough to invest in a company that, quite frankly, is virtually bankrupt. So why don't you step right up? We could sure use your money. Sorry, Rachel. I really am. But it wasn't my fault. Not your fault. It's not your fault you deliberately scare away every single client. It's not your fault that we lost the bank loan? Whose fault is it anyway? You wouldn't understand. Well, try me. Excuse me, lady. But I got orders to pick up a printer that's on a default. Go ahead. Take anything you like. It's all junk now anyway. What is that? It's Bert's resignation notice. Don't you touch me. All I did was open up to you a little bit and you turn on me for no reason whatsoever. How could one human being do that to another? [music playing] COACH: Just like we did at practice. OK. Tough defense, on three, everybody. One, two, three. Bandits! Go! Go, Bandits, go! Go, Bandits, go! Have a good game, Brent. [whistle blows] [game sounds] Looks like our secret weapon's a dud. Break it up. Break it up. Whoa, whoa. What's the matter with you, Logan? You tell me. You tell me. Sit down. Chill out. Shape up. You better see your mother. The school called. Brent, I'm very disappointed in you. I thought after Wednesday you'd finally begun to make an effort. That's just it. I wasn't even there on Wednesday. What about football and Mark Twain? I don't know who that was. But it wasn't me. Brent, that is absurd. I don't care. It's true. So what you're telling me is that even though a whole school full of people saw you, you weren't there. Yes. I'm too old for this kind of nonsense. It's not nonsense, Mom. Brent, I can't take anymore. Why won't you believe me? I'm telling the truth. I wasn't even there. What are you staring at? You shouldn't have said those things, Rachel. Please, you have never had children. Don't you dare try and tell me how to raise mine. It's much more-- The boy's not lying. How would you know? I just do. Another one of your brilliant answers. You know, I think I've had just about all I can take out of you. I think you better find a new place to stay, as of tomorrow. Remember when Dad put up this swing? Yeah. I believe you, Brent. I believe you weren't at school that day. Thanks, Case. No, I mean it. I think someone else went in your place. What? I think it was Clarence. What are you talking about? I think he changed into you. Come off it, Casey. I think he's-- well, I think he's an angel. Casey, please. No, I mean it. Casey, I'm not in the mood for your stupid make-believe, OK? [computer sounds] [music playing] Come on, Dexter. Speak to me. Hi, Dexter. [computer generated voice] Jeremy. Rachel, where are you going? Out. To do what? I should've done a week ago, sell to Brimmer. But-- Oh, Joseph, what am I going to do? Help her, Clarence. How? Oh, I just shouldn't have gotten involved in this. I knew it. So you gonna quit? You gonna walk out on these people right when they need you the most? Think about that family that's going to suffer. Joseph, look, why don't I just tell her why I'm here? If you tell her, Clarence, you'll lose your wings. You'll never get back to heaven and you won't get any younger. Is that what you want? No. No, it's not. But what else can I do? What else can I do? Well, Rachel, to what do I owe this unexpected pleasure? I've been giving it a lot of thought, and I think perhaps it's best for all concerned. Yes? I'll sell you the business. Well, let me get this straight. You, Rachel, the good, are willing once again to sell me the business? Look, are you interested or not? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just that I'm always amazed how life works out. It's just fascinating to me. Come here for a minute, I want to show you something. I won't bite you. Come on. I just want to show you my newest creation. You'll love this. I call him Hexter. It's got a nice ring to it, don't you think? Of course, it needs to be beefed up a bit. Kids can't stand to win. I can tell by your look that you really like it. But you know what would really make it sell. If we could get the voice to work. But without the technology my husband designed-- Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know. But we are getting close, quite close, especially with our new programmer. I-- I'm sorry, Rachel. Well, Rachel, you see, I really don't need to buy your company now. Because frankly, it's not worth a plug nickel. Now, if you wouldn't mind, there are some of us here who have to work. [music playing] You-- you didn't sell, did you? I have nothing to sell. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. Sir! Sir! What did you just do to Rachel Logan? I tried to stop him, Mr. Brimmer. Call Security, will you, Miss Kent? I said, what did you just do to Rachel Logan? I did to her what any good businessman would do to another, I crushed her like a walnut. And you know something, I really enjoyed doing it, too. You are one sad, pathetic excuse for a human being. No. What I am, Mr. Odbody, is a winner. You're no winner. A winner isn't the guy who makes his money by stepping on others. A winner isn't the guy who cheats and steals his way to the top. No, those are losers. You're a loser. And you know how I know that? Because everything you do now, you're going to have to pay for later, in one way or another. And you know that, huh? Yes, I do. For a fact? I do. [music playing] Brent, wait. Brent, there's something that I have to say to you. Save it, OK? You've said enough already. No. Brent-- How dare you act like that? Don't you care anything about your mother? Just as much as she cares about me. Brent, you are dead wrong. You think your mother gets angry with you because she likes it? You think she puts in 20 hour days for herself? Did you know that Bert quit? Did you know that your mother hasn't slept for days because she's been trying all by herself to get the program to work? No. Because she didn't want to tell you because she didn't want to worry you. Yeah, well it's a waste of energy, anyway. Nobody is going to be able to make things all right again. Your dad would be very disappointed if he heard that. What do you know about my dad? Leave him out of this. You don't know what you're talking about. Well, then, how come I know about that silver dollar in your pocket, the one that he gave you the day that he died? [music playing] You gotta have faith. It's what keeps the dreamers dreaming and the doers doing. Brent, you promised him. How do you know about that? Nobody knows about that. Somebody always knows. Where's Mommy going to sleep? Brent! Look after Casey, please. [music playing] [wind blowing] Rachel. Go away, Clarence. You can't do this. Your children have already lost their father. They can't lose their mother, too. You have to listen to me. I did. Look where it got me. Don't you remember the faith that Jeremy had to get through the bad times? Don't talk to me about Jeremy. You must believe me. This isn't your path. You don't know how much I miss him. I know. Let me help you. You can't help me. Please, Rachel. Not unless you can bring back Jeremy. And you can't do that, can you? I can. Rachel, I'm an angel. Take my hand, Rachel. [music playing] It's all right, Rachel. Rachel. Oh, Jeremy, I've missed you so much. I missed you, too. Promise me you'll never leave me again. Promise me. Jeremy? Rachel, it's not your time yet. You've still got things to do on earth. No. Jeremy, I can't. You see, everything's gone wrong. The business is dead. Forget about the business. Rachel. You know, it's funny, I don't think about the business at all anymore, at all. There isn't a single moment that goes by that I don't think about you and the kids. Jeremy, we were only doing it for them so that we could have time for them when-- Just watch them grow up, Rachel. Right now, you don't realize how wonderful that is. They need you, Rachel. You need them. [music playing] Clarence, can you take me back? [music playing] Mom, you're home. Hi, honey. I'm sorry I'm up so late. I know it's past my bedtime. Tell you what? Tonight you can stay up just as late as you like. Now where's that wonderful brother of yours? Come on, let's go. Brent? Mom, I've been working on Dexter. And I think I-- Oh, Brent. Dexter doesn't really matter. Not compared to you and Casey. I'm sorry I've been so hard on you. I'm sorry, too, Mom. I guess I just miss Dad. I know. I think we all do. You're not leaving, are you, Clarence? I have to, Casey. Mom, Clarence is leaving. You don't have to go, Clarence. I didn't mean what I said yesterday. Thank you, Rachel. But it's time for me to go. Thank you, Clarence. Brent. I'm sure going to miss your tuna casserole. Bye. Take care. Bye, Clarence. Bye, Clarence. DEXTER'S VOICE: Good-bye, Clarence. Who was that? Come and see. [computer generated music] Say good-bye to Clarence, Dexter. DEXTER'S VOICE: Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye, Clarence. Say it again. DEXTER'S VOICE: Good-bye, Clarence. See, Mom? I've solved the glitch. With Dad's notes, I've finally gotten the program to work. Say it again. DEXTER'S VOICE: Good-bye. Clarence, good-bye. Good-bye. So, where to? I don't know. Anywhere, it doesn't matter. Don't be so sure, Clarence. Joseph? Well, I gotta say, you really did it. You just about broke every rule in the book. And few that haven't even made the book yet. I mean, I'm going to be filling out violation reports until, well, until I'm a baby. Unless I can find somebody else to help me out up there. You know anybody who needs a job? Well, you don't mean-- You did everything wrong, Clarence, except for one thing. You put others ahead of yourself. And they seem to like that kind of stuff upstairs. Oh, but Joseph, I told Rachel who I was. Shh. Now you're ready to go home, Clarence? Yes, Joseph. I believe I am. [bell ringing] I knew it. [music playing]
