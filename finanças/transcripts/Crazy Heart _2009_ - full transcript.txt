Bad! Look at you, Bud! - I can see the mountains! I haven't felt like this ever! This is insane! (?) What a ride! Come here! Wow! Was that fun? - My God! You gotta go up there, it's like another world! Kiss me. Take that. Nasty gale. (?) Pretty darn intense. Is it always like that? - What are you talking about? You've been married a lot. - Yeah, but I, you know, I didn't ... I've got a 28-year-old son, Jeanie. I haven't seen him since he was four. Where is he? - I dunno. His mother, Mary Jo, lives in Marfa, Texas. I do not know what he looks like, or what he does. I never taught him to ride a bike or watch him play baseball. None of that. Why not? - I dunno. I wasn't there, even when I was. I couldn't live if I lost Buddy. That's the damndest part. I did. I wanna get away by ourselves this weekend. What day is it today? - Thursday. I'm not coming back to this city. (?) - In a while. (?) Come here now. Come here! Don't rip the pretty dress. Come here! I gotta go, I gotta go. I love you. Where are you going? (?) I gotta get to the paper. I'll drop Buddy off at daycare and call you at about three. Let him stay here with me. You don't wanna babysit. What do you mean? - Buddy, you wanna see you friends, right? Come on, we want to stay here, Mom. Yes, we want to stay here. - We do? Please. - And do what? Man stuff. - Yeah, man stuff. How will you do that with your ankle? Come on, it'll be good for us. Please, Mom. - We'll be fine, I promise. All right. His lunch box is over there. I'll get his car seat. Here, take this. Can you pick me up some cream of tartar? I need it for my biscuits. Some what? - Cream of tartar. Do you play cards? - Yeah. What do you play? - Just regular, like (???). Hey. - What? You know what we oughtta do? We oughtta go and see if we can find some trouble to get into. Yeah, big trouble. - Be kinda fun. Let's see what's in your box. There you go! Put your head back. I got you! I got you! Hey, be careful up there, don't fall down! Hey, Bud. I've brought you something. Bud? Buddy? Oh my God. My god, you scared me. What time is it? We had fun. Nobody died. You taste like chocolate. Look what I've brought you. You're my roadie and groupie all rolled into one. Set those down there. Look at that paint job, huh? That's rust - metal flake rust. I want you to come to Houston. Would you do that? Throw those in there. I'll be there for four months. Nights only, so I got my days off. I took time off for your visit, so I don't know if I can. You can take Buddy. There's all kinds of great stuff for kids... All right, we'll see. - that aquarium with a big fountain. All right, we'll see. "We'll see." That means no. - No, it means "we'll see". All right? Lotta good stuff to write about in Houston. And there's me. - That's more than a visit. A lot of the good stuff, too. - Jesus. I don't wanna hear it, darlin'. I don't want it around Buddy, that much I know. I heard you the first time. - It's like living with a rattlesnake. Wait. I can't see you. Ay?dame, amigo. Basura, basura. Ay?dame, vamos a limpiar, okay? Then I'll teach you some words of English. Hey, hey! - Hey. What are you doing here? I've been looking for you. Jesus, Bad. You look like shit, man. - Yeah, I know... it's all the toilets I have to play in. - Yeah? Good to see you. Sorry about the wreck, I heard about that. Could've been worse. - Yeah. How's business? - Business? What business? Since you've been on the road, I tell you ... it's crap. - Yeah, well if you cleaned this joint ... maybe you'd figure out how to get this business running. If I cleaned it up I might find out that we're both broke. I had to git rid of my bartender. It's just me and old Jesus. Shit. - Yeah, just us. So? How's the road? - Not getting any shorter. Makes coming back here look good. I have a feeling, knowing you, that something happened. Special. Yeah, I met a woman in Santa Fe. - Yeah? Doesn't surprise me. She's a good one, real good. - Yeah? More? No, not any more. That's it. - Oh, you sumbitch. So. Santa Fe's a long way from here, right? 879 miles. It's a tough trip for a man who has to work Saturday nights, right? Yeah. Yeah, but worth it. - We'll get you back in shape singing. I want you to meet somebody. Oiga, Jesus. Come here. I want you to meet a legend. Big Bad. Hi there, what's your name? - Juan. Yeah, Juan. - Juan. Or Jesus. Whatever. A good man. Hello. Hi. Is this Steven Reynolds? Yeah, who's calling? Actually I'm on a bit of a hunting trip.... I'm trying to track down a Mary Jo Reynolds. She lived in Nashville from 1980 to 1985. Born in Lima, Ohio. You wouldn't be related, would you? She was my mother. Hey buddy, I can't hear you. Who is this? Your father. Who? I'm Bad Blake. I'm here in Houston. I'm your father. How are you? What do you want? I'm kinda shocked to hear your voice. You said "was". Mary Jo's dead? Two years, come October. What happened? Everything. I'm sorry, Steven. Yeah. Well listen, what do you want? I want to see you. I don't think so. Will you think about it? I'm sorry sir, I probably won't be able to help you. Wanna take down my number? I got your number. Well ... Sleep on it, think about it, and ... I really would like to talk. Imagine that. I made the cars go real fast. And when the collide they go boom! (?) Oh, you got the cars, huh? I can make them go faster than anybody, then they crash! What he's trying to say is "thank you". But you gotta stop sending him things. He thinks you're Santa Claus. I do think he's Santa Claus. I want him to know I'm thinking about him, darling. Are you thinking about me? Yes I am. Are you all right? I called my son last night, Jeanie. And? He wouldn't talk to me. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't blame him. Jeanie ... I'm not feeling well. I'll have to call you back. Bad? Big Bad, where are you, boy? No, not again. We're going fishing, all right? Let's go. You forget? Let's go. Get dressed, I'm waiting on you. Toss me another one of those barley pops, would you? Here you go. I hate to admit it, but this was a damn good idea. I just sent what might be my best song ever to Tommy. To record? - Yes. It's one of those you hate to give up. - Why'd you do it? He's paying me awful good. He's in LA now, recording it. Well I hope he don't fuck it up. He can't fuck it up. It's that good. So your boy won't talk to you? No.. I don't blame him. I was wrong. I had no right to call him. Wait. You were wrong 25 years ago, and wrong since, but ... you called him. Now you're not wrong. You're right, he's wrong. - I went 25 years without trying to find him. He's right. Too little, too late. - No. It's never too late son, never too late. You called him, it's done. All right? It's complete. Now you're on the right track. Just keep going. He's your son. He is all I got. - Keep after him. It's what you gotta do. It reminds me of a song by Billy Joe Shaver. "I'm gonna live forever. Gonna cross that river. Gonna catch tomorrow now ." Goes something like: "Nobody here will ever find me... but I'll always be around. Just like the songs I leave behind me... I'm going to live forever now." And listen to this, now: "You fathers and mothers, be good to one another... please try to raise your children right. Don't let the darkness take them... Don't make them feel forsaken, just lead them safely to the light." Hello. - Hi. Are you all right? - Yeah, fine. Why? You didn't sound all right yesterday. Sounded like you were dying. Must've been food poisoning or something. Well I'm calling because I got 4 days off at the end of this month... And I thought we might come. But now I'm not sure it's such a good idea. What do you mean? It's a great idea. Why would you say that? Are you sure you're OK? I'm worried about you. Don't waste a minute worrying about me. There's nothing wrong a visit won't cure. How's Buddy? He's fine. So? You gonna come? Hey there - oh, you've got you car! I think he's had it. All right, Bud? - He's eating in his sleep! What do you think of these big buildings, Bud? Even Superman couldn't leap over these. Right here is where Sam Houston and his boys beat Santa Anna and his Mexicans. If it wasn't for this spot, we'd all be speaking Mexican. That's where Texas got its start, right there. Do you speak any Mexican, Buddy? "Agua" and "adios." That's pretty good! Wow, Bud, what do you see there? Where did he go? I think there's a watch for that one there. (?) Are you getting tired? - He's got so much energy he wears me out. Why not go back to that park and take a load off? Let Bud and I fool around... and we'll come back around noon and take you out to lunch. All right. Okay, you have your wish in your head? 'Cos here's the spot. Here. Pick one. Pick some, you can have a bunch. There you go, that's good. Here's mine. Can't see it. Hey Bud, wanna go inside where it's cool? Let's do that. Come on. Let's go in this place and wet our whistles before we pop outta the ground. Out of the ground? Like that guy on TV? - What guy? The one on TV - Yeah, that guy. Come on. Hi there. How are you guys today? - All right. Take a load off there, Bud. I'll take a McCure's, if you got it... Make it a double. Ginger ale for my pal here. Also a double. Mine on the rocks, please. How about you? Rocks. Lookie here. Look at this. You wanna go explore? You can. What did you get? Wow, Bud, you're getting all kinds of good stuff. That's $12.50 altogether. $12.50? Jesus! Does this music drive you crazy? If I heard it, it probably would. Bud, come on and get your ginger ale. Buddy? He's probably in the restroom. Buddy! Come on, Bud. Did he come back out here? - No. Buddy! What the hell? Did you see a little boy come in here? Bud? No.. I lost my little boy. He's got brown hair. Four years old His name's Buddy. Buddy? What was he wearing? I don't remember. - Okay, well, sir... where did you last see him? - In a bar. A bar. Which bar, sir? - Hell, I don't know. It was a little dark bar. - Okay. All stations, we've got a lost boy... four years old, brown hair. Name's Buddy. Report back, please. Thank you. - Why don't you stay here with me? No, I gotta go find him. He's lost... he's from New Mexico. We're supposed to be meeting his mother. I understand you want to find him, but I need you to stay here. All the guys are looking for him. All right, sir? Sir, how much have you had to drink today? I had a drink. - A drink. What difference does that make? - You lost him, sir. Yeah, I lost him. I'm gonna go find him. Bud! Have you seen a little boy? What's going on? - They're gonna find him, hon. Where's Buddy? - They got all these guards looking for him. What? - No need to worry. The guards are looking for him? - I stopped just for a second. You stopped for a drink? Please don't touch me. Please don't touch me. Excuse me... hi, I'm the momma of the boy who's lost. I said, do not touch me! Bud, come here baby. -There's my Buddy boy. You're gonna be fine. There's my Buddy boy. Everything's gonna be fine. Shut up. - We just got our wires crossed. You can't go now, you don't have a ticket. I should've trusted my instincts. Every bone in my body told me not to get on that plane. Everything's gonna be okay, Jeanie. - No. Everything's not okay. He's four years old. He's scared out of his wits. I wouldn't do anything to hurt him. - But you did! Just like every other man in my life. Just nothing but self-involved assholes! Come on, now. Just calm down. Let me... Can I have his backpack? - Jamie... Can't we talk about it? - Don't you touch me! It's too fucking hard! Stop! Let me drive you to the airport. - Sorry, Bud. Let me drive you, at least. Come on. Come on, babe. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Let me take that. - Thank you. All right, you get your seatbelt on. Jean. Jeanie! Hello. - Wayne? Bad? - I want to get sober. I'm Bad. I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, Bad. A couple of days ago I lost a little boy. I was drunk. Been drunk most of my life. I've lost a hell of a lot. I heard you're an entertainer. I am. I'm glad you're here. We know what a hard step it is. Look who's here. Hey, good to see you! Good to see you! How do you feel? - I feel great. Really? - Oh, man. Take it from someone who's been there. It don't last necessarily. It's gonna get rough. And you'll feel worthless, maybe... but I'm gonna help you with it. - Pleased to hear you tell me that. Grab that, old buddy, I'm gonna help you. Let's put this in there. - Yeah. I think I've got this thing licked. Let's hope so. One day at a time, all right? - Yeah, I heard that. Get your butt in the truck. Let's go. We'll see. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. It's so good to be home. What are you doing here? - Listen to me. I'm sorry. Sorry with all my heart. I'm sober. Detox, the whole bit. It woke me up. That's good, Bad. - I'm not Bad. I'm going back to Otis, my given name. No more Bad. I've changed everything. That's good. How's Buddy? - Sleeping. He's all right. Will you ever forgive me? God, I knew what the risks were with you... and I took them because... I love you, and... putting Buddy in your hands... I don't know if I'll ever be able to get over that. I'm different now. - I am, too. Let me prove it. You're not listening to me. - We can start over. Listen to me. I am so... I am truly happy for you... I hope you make a really nice life for yourself... but Buddy and I can't be a part of it. But I love both of you so much. If that's true you'll leave us alone, all right? Come on, Jean, don't say that. Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Y'all waiting to hear a song? How are you holding up? Good. This song was written by my mentor - more a friend. And well... it kinda speaks for itself. I sure do hope y'all like it. That's one hell of a song. Which reminds me.... They're getting bigger by the day, kid. - Yeah, I'll say. See you later Jack. - Hey Bad... that was a great show. And you're doing real good. Keep it up, I'm proud of you. Still a little gas left in the tank. See you now. Mr. Blake. Hi. You were in vintage form today. Vintage. That's about right. I heard you might be here. Not working for the Sun now. What's this? You can't hold back a good woman from Enid, Oklahoma. He's a good guy Yeah, well, you deserve one. Wanna see Buddy? He's here. No.. I'd love to, but I don't know if... it's the best thing for him. Look, would you give this to him on his 18th birthday for me? What is it? No, Bad. I don't want this. - Hey... I don't want this. Come on, now. Hey... - I don't- there wouldn't be this song if not for you. That's not money. That's awfully kind of you. I'm glad to hear you're doing so well. - Well, one day at a time. So you'll give me an interview? I sure will. I'd say let's do it on the bus, but it's much prettier out here, isn't it? It is. -My god, look at that. So you've been all right I guess, huh? I've been all right. - Yeah. Me too.
