I don't want you to go either. I don't want to work at this cafe without you. Of course I don't want you to go. But I want you to see the world. If becoming a barista is your newfound dream, then I hope you become the best out there. I don't want you to give up something for my sake. I want to help you grow. Although we're apart right now, but later... when you make your first kimchi, when you hold your first baby, when you join the PTA, and when your kids get married... I'll be by you side. It's hard for us to be apart, but let's bear with it. Last Cup Good morning. It?s already morning. What am I going to do? My mom's going to kill me! I didn't tell her that I'm leaving. I?ll go with you and talk to your mother. No, it's okay. - Where are my clothes? - Over there. - I?ll get them for you. - No, I?ll do it. Stop looking at me, will you? Why? Do you have a problem with that? When did these get here? - What? - There's another one here. You're as light as a feather! Eat up, since you won't be able to eat these after you leave. You can't eat greasy food. How are you going to eat once you're there? What do you want to eat? A train! What's this? A spaceship? Call me whenever you can. Email me everyday, okay? You sound as though you're leaving tomorrow. I thought you were only going to write once a week if I go to New York. That was before. You're so self-centered. Don't grow your hair or wear miniskirts. If people ask you if you have a boyfriend, tell them you're married. Try not to let people see you, understand? I'm not invisible. Of course people will see me! Don't talk back to me. Just say yes. Don't work too hard. If you get a headache, take a break. If your muscle aches, massage it, okay? Take care of yourself. It'll be sad if you get sick away from home. Call me whenever you get sick. I?m going to get mad at you if you don't. I?ll miss you a lot, don't you think? Yeah. I should take a good look at you before I go. Your eyes, your nose, and your ears are all mine. Cut it out. Get on. Let's go on a date everyday before you leave. Where did you want to go again? The amusement park? Building 63? Movie theater? Folk Village? Let's visit all of them. Let's visit all of them. And Namsan. Namsan? - Hello, Eun-Sae. - Hey! Are you out of your mind? Were you with your boss last night? Sheesh, why do I even bother asking? Listen. I told mom that you're going to work after exercising, so go straight to work. Okay, thanks. You guys owe me one, okay? Okay, bye. Is that from home? Eun-Sae came up with an excuse for me. I should give her a lot of allowance. No! You're going to spoil her. How did you guys get here together? I ran into her on the way. I should start working right away. Wait, wait, something's fishy. She wore that yesterday! What happened last night? Did you get some action? What action? Get back to work. I know you did it! Where do you think you're going? Look me in the eye! She always wears the same thing! What should we do for Eun-Chan? She probably needs money, but I doubt she'll take it. Maybe we should get Han-Gyul a round trip ticket. He's down because Eun-Chan's leaving. I wouldn't be surprised if he visits her once a month. Unlike someone I know. Who? Me? What about me? How many times did you visit me when I studied in Paris? I wanted to go too! But I was too busy with my thesis! Han-Gyul probably would've dropped everything and flew. Eun-Chan is so lucky. Lucky her. Han-Gyul is lucky too. Eun-Chan is six years younger than you, right? - Is that what you think? - Yes. - Really? Really? Really? - Stop it! Why are you hopping around like a grasshopper? Keep working. - Congratulations! - Be quiet! Congratulations! Mr. Hong! Mr. Choi and Eun-Chan were smooching in the restroom with his pants off! So? They smooch all the time. Just leave them alone. Hey! Your fly's open. Hey! Go to the restroom and check Eun-Chan out. She's glowing. See? She looks different! - No, I?m just sweating. - You look different from yesterday. Hey! - Your Byul was glowing too. - My Byul? Where? What's going on? There's something fishy about her. I think she's a playette. No way! I can't figure her out. I think she's way ahead of you. You're cleaning again? Don't do a sloppy job just because you'll be leaving soon. Mop every corner, okay? Okay. Mop, mop, mop. Don't forget to mop the corners! But I already cleaned that side! - Mop under the shelves too. - Follow the line. No, I?ll mop this side later. - Are you bored or something? - Bored? Don't talk to your boss that way. Just do as I say. Hurry! Mop the corners where the doors are. It?s dusty! Over there. Go, go, go! Where do you think you're going? One more time! Go inside! What's wrong with you? One more time! Hey! What's this? Shall we take a look? They're shoes. Maybe a guest left them here. I think this will look good on you! Try them on! But they're not even mine! Baristas needs to stand on their feet the whole day. You need good shoes. Did you put that in there? How did you know my size? It was exactly this long. Gosh, you're making my heart flutter. Thanks, but I?m starting to get sad. I've never done anything for you. There's something you can do for me. Scratch my back. Where? Here? Very good. This feels great! This is because you only take showers. You should go get a nice scrub at the public bathhouse. You'd better scratch my back like this even after we get old, okay? Get yourself a backscratcher instead. But I heard that your lover will run away if you buy her shoes. Don't worry, I wrote a magic spell inside. Really? Where? You're mine. Choi Han-Gyul. Nice work. Just relax, and think of it as an opportunity to see the world. No, this program itself is an opportunity. I should study hard. What if you come back as soon as you get there because you miss me? Maybe you will, but not me. What about me? I hope you don't get on the plane every week because you miss me. Hold on. My batter's almost dead. Hold on...hold on...hold on... Done! I have a question. Isn't your dream girl someone sexy, slim, and feminine like Yoo-Joo? Yes. How did you know? Then why do you like me? I?m nothing like Yoo-Joo. I?m a philanthropist. I?m the only man who can save a woman like Ko Eun-Chan. You always talk back in a husky voice, you're stubborn, and you drink and eat too much. Gosh, I?m so benevolent. Same here. You're not my dream man either. What? Then who's your dream man? Someone like my father. Someone like your father? I?m nothing like him. From what I heard, he sounded very gentle and family-oriented. Yes, you're noting like him. But I see some similarities. Really? Like what? Your eyes. What? My eyes? When you smile at me, your eyes remind me of that of my dad's. What? Do you know how good-looking my eyes are? They're masculine and strong. You can't find many eyes like mine. Are you there? Hello? Are you sleeping? Ko Eun-Chan! You need to hang up before you sleep. Otherwise, I can't sleep. Hey shorty! What are you doing? You're really sleeping? Shorty! Shorty! Hang up the phone before you sleep. She's so cute! Oh, my... Eun-Chan! Wake up. Wake up. It?s hot! I woke up with the sound of morning* - I say to you as you're sleeping... - Hello? Hello? I love you We'll never have to say goodbye Yes, we'll have our moments of tears and sadness But I?ll always dream with you And until the heaven sets us apart I love you One more time! I love you One more time! I love you Doesn't it feel great to wake up to my songs? Ko Eun-Chan! Ko Eun-Sae! Time for breakfast. Time for breakfast. See you soon. Bye. *But I?ll always be with you... I love you* *I love you* One more time! What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? One more time! - *I love you* - Get off me! Mr. Choi! You should go home early and pack. Your mom will be sad if you don't. Yes, Mr. Hong. Don't skip your meals. I?ll be back soon, so get along with my mom before I do, okay? That's no way to say goodbye. You should make your farewells short. Bye. Mr. Hong, you know that I really, really like you, right? Get off me. Mr. Choi might see you. There's a hole. Doesn't that feel good? Uh...Eun-Chan... Yes? What's this? It?s a gift...for you. A gift? It?s beauty care. You'll look good with make-up, but not as good as Eun-Sae. Gee, thanks. You know that I really respect and like you, right? Don't worry about Angel and your mom. I?ll protect them. Okay, I feel assured because of you. I?m counting on you, Hwang Min-Yup. Eun-Chan! Good luck! What are you doing? This is so awkward. Take care. You'll do great. I believe in you. Thank you. Go for it! Go for it! Already? I?m not ready yet. Ha-Rim, we've had our differences, but I really like you. You know that too, right? Why are you crying? Stop crying. Whatever. My Chan! Good luck in Italy. I don't know if I can sleep at night after you're gone. I?m not too worried about you because I know you can eat and sleep anywhere. But I?m worried about men. Even if someone sweet-talks you or flash his killer smile, don't fall for him. I?ll keep an eye on Han-Gyul. I'd go for you if you weren't Han-Gyul's girl. - My Chan, I?ll miss you. - I?ll miss you too. P.S. Dreams do come true. Dreams do come true. Dreams do come true. Yes! I don't want to go. No, I have to go and work. I thought you're not doing the exhibition. But I still have work to do. You're so mean. I?m cutting down on my work and I?m not hanging out with my friends... for Han-Sung and our baby's sake. Don't do this to me. Are you craving anything? No, I?m fine. Then wait for me. Your husband is on his way to eat your dinner. Yoo-Joo. Yoo-Joo! Sleep some more. The winter there isn't as cold as Seoul. Don't pack too many winter clothes. What? Why? I?ll visit you in winter. I can bring whatever you need when I do. You're coming in the winter? The winter...that's a long wait. Don't you need more? You can't eat without soy and chili paste. Wait, you should take kimchi too. Mom! I want red pepper too! Why are you laughing? You can get those at the local Korean market. Really? Mom! I don't need them! l can buy them in Italy. Are you sure you don't need these? I already read all of them! Take it back. Hold this for me. - Did you pack your medicines? - Huh? Digestive aids or painkillers. You should take them instead of trying to find a pharmacy when you get there. Mom! Where are the digestives? What am I going to do with you? Hang up the phone and start packing. - Eun-Chan. - Yes? I won't go to the airport because I think I'll ask you to stay if I do. Okay. I?ll call you later. Don't eat everything you see. Watch out for strangers. Don't smile and talk to anyone who look nice. Don't worry. What else do you need? I wrote down a list, but I forgot where I left it. It?s okay, I?ll take care of it. I already feel empty... I feel down now that Eun-Chan's gone. Is Mr. Choi still out making deliveries? Maybe he's crying somewhere. Maybe we should've gone to the airport. How depressing. Huh? By the way, where's Mr. Hong? I wonder if the plane took off already... Darn... I told Mom and Eun-Sae not to come to the airport. I don't think I can leave if they cry at the airport. Good. You should just sleep on the airplane in case you get airsick. Your homestay provider will wait for you at the airport. You have the number, right? You asked me that dozens of times. I?m not a kid. You should go if you don't want to be late. Call me when you get here. Okay. Bye. Take care. You too. Hey... I love you. I love you. Choi Han-Gyul, I love you. I know. 2 years later... April 29th, 2009 To: Han-Gyul. Choi Han-Gyul and Ko Eun-Chan on the September Milan sky in 2008 December, 2007: There's a lot of hot guys in here. A lot of guys are after me too. But I still think you're the hottest guy of them all. May, 2008 - I miss you. It?s 10:40AM right now. I've been sleeping in lately because I don't need to work. I can't tell whether I?m here to study or play. But I?m learning a lot, thanks to you and your grandma. This is fun. Thank you. You're so lovely. I?ll try to be as cool as you are and come home. I miss you. I really do. Gosh, I miss you. I love you. Here's my kiss! January 4th, 2009 at a delicious burger shop We should come together next time. I think this burger is big enough for the both of us. I?m eating this burger while missing Coffee Prince Gosh, I?m almost done. The first shop of Coffee Princess will attract its guests with a full female staff, starting from the barista. Mr. Choi! Mr. Choi...Mr. Choi...Mr. Choi... Okay, good. What's wrong with the main model? She's so average. Too average. I?m not a nude model, but why do I always have to take my clothes off? Yup, this is what everyone goes through in the beginning. Besides, you're pretty unique. Hey back model! Get ready. Yup, remember. I want you to walk for Andre someday. Angel, do you think I can take a full face picture someday? Of course! You've made great progress in just months. Trust me on this. Good, very juicy. - Let's do it! - Let's do it! Soo-Jin, to the side. Put your left hand on the shoulder. Hi. Did you buy your plane ticket? Not yet... What? One more year? What are you talking about? It?s special privilege for the competition winner. I wanted to study one more year, and I?m getting a full scholarship. I can travel around the world for a demo. - I want to do it. - No! No way! You promised grandma that you'll be back after 2 years! We already started construction for Coffee Princess so we can open as soon as you come back! Then do you want me to give it up? You don't want me to do it. Okay, I?ll do as you say. I?d better go. I?ll call you later. Hey! How are you doing? You're not sick or anything like that, right? Of course not. You know how strong I am. Bye, My Gyul. Bye. Please leave a message after the tone... But that blind date didn't mean anything! Why is this doing this to me? Fine, it's over! She's so narrow-minded. Why, I ought to... What's wrong with the door? Myung-Soo! Come here with the floor plan. Here. Do you know what the theme of Coffee Princess is? The lovely princess theme... Yes, lovely. But nothing there looks lovely! This looks more like a fighting arena. Maybe we'll ask Fedor to play a game here. Please don't miss the strategy meetings anymore. I need to explain it to you every time. All I need to do is make good coffee... Mr. Choi! We don't get to see you here anymore. You should come more often. Hwang Min-Yup, how's modeling? Good. I even changed my name. Hwang Min, like Eun-Sae asked me to. That's so cheesy. Why won?t' you let Eun-Sae come home early? Don't let her stay out past midnight. Don't do this to me. When Eun-Chan was around, you made her stay out late. - You even spent the night with her. - When did I do that? But I had a good reason! - I?m not like you! - Hello, Sir. Hello. My name is Ha Da-Young. I want you to teach me how to make coffee. Please accept me as your student. What is she talking about? This is Prince, we only accept men. - We don't accept women. - Why not? Even Eun-Chan worked here. Hi! I?m Jin Ha-Rim, and I?m 27. - How about you? - Hi. I know you! I was a regular here. I?m Ha Da-Young, and I?m 24. Gosh, I?m so popular. A straight nose, thick lips... I think they're thicker than Eun-Chan's. She's my type. What? Sorry I?m late. You sure are brave. Don't you know that I?ll nag you for years if you come late on a day like this? The meeting ran late. Excuse me, I need a glass. And you came empty-handed. You didn't even get me flowers? See that? The people who think Choi Han-Sung is nice don't know... what he doesn't even buy flowers for his wedding anniversary. You don't need flowers when you have me! I don't believe this... Congratulations on our 2nd wedding anniversary. Yes, I should be congratulated for living with such a busy husband. - What's this? - What do you mean what? I have a suite for us. I?ll treat you all night long. Geez... Geez? I mean a massage. I?ll give you a full body massage. - Yes, a massage. - A massage? Right now? We should start interviewing as soon as Eun-Chan comes back. It?ll be hard with just the girls. Working at a cafe requires a lot of labor. We'll have to discuss it with Eun-Chan when she comes back. It won't be a problem when Chan comes back. She's as strong as two men put together. I don't know about that. She's older now. Redo the parts I checked off. What? Again? How many revisions do you need? I know your baby's going to be at this cafe, but you're overdoing it. She's still here? She's not done yet? All the women who come here are so determined. She's following in Ko Eun-Chan's steps. I heard that your baby's getting a lot of offers in Milan. Maybe she's not back yet because she's got something up her sleeves. Did Eun-Chan betray Mr. Choi? What is this? A soap opera? She wants to stay another year. She betrayed you. Anyways, poor you. You're turning into a celibate. What's there to think about? Tell her to come back. You should go and drag her back here if she refuses. I can't do that. She wants to study. Finish everything by mid-September. Why is Eun-Chan so greedy? She should just kick back and come back. That's what my Angel does. Han-Gyul! We haven't had a drink in a long time! Good idea! Why do you want to cook for? Do you have a problem with that? We're both lonely birds here. We should eat good food at least if we want to stay healthy. lf you're concerned about your hearth, you should clean your room first. Mr. Hong! What's wrong? You seem to be doing well. Your husband seems like a nice person. You have one kid? Yes, he's in first grade. Do you still run the cafe? Yes, it's now called Coffee Prince. You should come and visit sometime. Okay. Are you still single? Yes. I left because I wanted you to find a better woman and be happy. But I?m glad you seem to be doing fine. Yeah right. Huh? I heard that you got married. You seem to be happy. I live like any other women do. My husband gives me a handful of trouble, so I don't feel bad when I do something wrong either. That's good. But you're allergic to peaches. I?m so nosy. My husband likes them. I?m fine as long as I wash them with gloves on. Mr. Hong, let's go. The ice cream is melting. Fine, fine. You should go. I?ll stay behind this time. Okay, I should try leaving first too. Let's go this way. She insists that both Eun-Chan and Eun-Sae need to get married first? What about us? Just leave me then. I?m not stopping you. Be quiet, will you? You're too old for this. Just sleep with him. Or maybe you already did. What are you talking about? Why are you so blunt? You seem to be in a bad mood today. I met my ex today. Who? The one who ran off with your money? What was her name? Mi-Ja or Mi-Sook? I think Mi-Sook's son looks like me. No way. He has clear eyes just like I do. That's his habit. He even told me that Eun-Chan looks like him. Your eyes look like pollack eyes! But Eun-Chan's aren't! Pollack eyes? My eyes are clear! Cut it out! You tend to be too casual with my Ji-Hyang! Stop calling her 'My Ji-Hyang'! But she's my Ji-Hyang? Cut it out, you two! Come over here! I thought your legs must be swollen... because you've been standing in the research center the whole day, but your figure's still great. Are you still mad because I went clubbing? Men tend to party at places like that. I want to break up with you. I told you that doesn't get to me anymore. Try stirring me up with some other line. You really want to break up? Shall we? Yeah, it's absurd that I?ve been dating the same girl for two years. Okay, I?ll leave this here. It was nice knowing you. Bye. Hey Jin Ha-Rim! Do you know that your eyes droop down whenever you pretend to be cheerful? You're analyzing me again. See? My eyes aren't drooping down! Take a good look. I know you're having a hard time because of your father. Why didn't you tell me? How did you know? I know about your hospital. I heard it closed down. Is that what this is about? The hospital's going to reopen. You don't know my father very well. You should've asked me. It?s not a secret. Let's see... Why do we go for a drink instead? There you go again, weaseling your way out. This is just who I am. Let's just drop it. Are you okay? You know what? I don't like the lighting in this school. Why is it so bright in here at night? Darling, is there a better place to hang out in this school? I don't think there's anyone in the lab. But I hate the lab... Let's pack our things. Follow me. Run! Do you want me to heat up the milk if you can't sleep? Now that my next exhibition is scheduled, I can't work. Yoo-Joo. I won't ask for more. You're always with me, and we both love our jobs. I can't ask for more. Do you really think so? Am I asking for too much? Let's stop going to the hospital. I don't want you to overstrain yourself. Do you want to go on a trip tomorrow? Tomorrow? You must be very busy. Forget it then. I?ll go by myself. Don't go by yourself. Let's go together after I?m done with this gig. No, I want to go by myself. Where do you think you're going? Come over here. Let's sleep. You're not going anywhere... I?m not in right now. Please leave a message after the beep. Thank you. Hey there, stubborn kid. When you come back, you'd better pay me back... for all the heartaches you've given me. You can study like you want. But just for one more year. Call me when you get this message. Ko Eun-Chan! Hurry back! I miss you! Hurry back! Is that a resume for a barista? I?m interviewing someone today. Want to join me? Heck no. - What did you just do? - I?m sorry! I?m sorry! Why are you here? I?m sorry. What are you going to do? Let's just wait for a few more days. There's nothing to lose. I hate it when people touch my kitchen utensils. Get out. I only wanted to organize the place for you. I?m sorry if I offended you. - By the way, Sir. - Don't call me that. Can you teach me how to make waffles? Your waffles are so soft. You really don't listen, do you? I?ll work hard! Huh? What the? You're both speaking Japanese? Where did you learn how to speak Japanese? I studied in Mayazaki. It feels great to speak Japanese for once. What were you two talking about? You're not talking about me, right? We talked about how nice you are. Satisfied? I don't trust you anymore. I don't like how the place will be operated according to the theme, and that I?ll be stuck for 2 years. I?m thinking about running my own cafe. Working at our cafe will help you gain experience. To be honest with you, the pay is... I need at least double of what I?m getting right now. Double? I see. You'll hear the results from the HR later. Thank you. Mr. Choi! Mr. Choi! Are you done with the interview? I?m thirsty because I?ve been waiting for so long. I?m here for an interview too. Nice to meet you, I?m Ko Eun-Chan. I heard that you're looking for a barista. I?m pretty good. Would you like to hire me? Oh, I see. Do you have your resume? Are you a man, or a woman? Do you have an ID? My ID? Hold on... I forgot. But I?m a girl! The other girl wanted double of her pay or something, but I'll work for food. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight snacks. I only need four meals. I can mop, I?m very strong, and I make good coffee. I would also like to add that I won the World Barista Competition. I?m really good. We're looking for someone hard-working and diligent, regardless of experience. I?m very diligent. I might even do your laundry and clean your house if you ask nicely. What a surprise. When did you get back? I missed you. You smell nice. You haven't changed. Your eyes stayed the same, your nose is as straight as ever, and your lips are sexy too. Wow, my boyfriend is handsome. You were going to come back anyways. You fooled me. Look at these dark circles I have because of you! Where? Here? Were you that sad? Stop it. It?s hot. I?m already fuming. Quit grumbling. Aren't you happy to see me? Do you want me to get back on the plane? Are you threatening me? I?m not leaving, even if you ask me to. I?m going to stay right next to you from now on, not even a minute apart. 24 hours? Every night and day? Then we should get married fast. You'll be busy with Coffee Princess. When's the interview? Do you think the construction will be done by September? I?ve been invited to the Latte Art demonstration. I?m going to have an interview too. It?ll be in a coffee magazine. Ko Eun-Chan is hot! Don't change the subject. I talked to your mother a few days ago. I wonder how your grandma's doing. Hello! It?s me, Ko Eun-Chan! I?m not deaf. Don't talk so loud. How have you been? When are you going to start working? - What? - What do you mean, what? You should start working right away. - You should let her rest for a few days. - I?d like to say hi to your family first. I even bought you a gift, so look forward to it. I never asked you for a gift! Grandma, we'll visit you tomorrow. See you tomorrow! Bye! She asked me not to tell Han-Gyul that she's coming, but they're already together. They're so into each other. She must've been short on money, but she called me several times about your gift. She's very considerate, unlike most kids. I met her during my last business trip. She's very upright and cheerful. I like her. What are you two doing? You're all head over heels over her. You only have one son. Don't you want a better daughter-in-law? She's a good kid. What more can we ask for? I?ll make a nice mallow soup for dinner. She didn't need to buy me a gift... Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Hey guys! My girlfriend's here! My girlfriend's here! Mr. Hong! Look who we have here! Why didn't you call? My Chan! How weird. Stop it! Are you girl? Eun-Chan! You've gotten so much prettier! - But you're still fat. - Hey! Chan! You've gotten so much prettier. - Me too! - Me too! This is weird. - Take her for a tour. - Okay. You might hurt her! Stop it! Mr. Hong! Aren't you happy to have me as your husband? I sure am Hmm...kiss kiss Please? You never listen, do you? I?ll work hard. Can I have your cell phone number? Well, I don't want you to get upset. Do you want my address too? Hello? Hi, Byul. This weird woman kept on hitting on me, but I retaliated. Don't worry. I?m good, huh? Goodbye, Coffee Prince! Coffee Prince is closed for the day
