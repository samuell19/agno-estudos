June 15th, 1944. The U.S. military invades Saipan and the Northern Mariana's group of islands. The marines moved ashore. Establishing themselves on the Southwest coast. On their way, taking control of the island. Under Japanese control Saipan is called home by 20,000 over citizens. And defended by over 30,000 highly trained members of the imperial fighting forces. Though one of the most strategically important of the Japanese strongholds in the pacific. Saipan's defenses folded. Under the onslaught of the American war machines, numbering over 70,000 strong. And in the ensuing battle the majority of the Japanese defenders are annihilated. And the survivors flee to Mount Tapochau. Located at the centre of the island. Taiheiyou no Kiseki ~ Fox to Yobareta Otoko (Miracle in Pacific ? The man who was called Fox) Keep your heads down! Down! Medic! Medic! Help! I'll go. Medic! - Ammo! - We're out! Ammo! Medic! Enemy planes! Stay put! It hurts! Hey! Naito! Naito! Unbeknownst to the Japanese on the island. The imperial navy suffers a humiliating defeat in the seas off the mariana's Making the imperial command no choice. But to abandon the defense of Saipan. The uninformed defenders however continued to fight. Believing in the inevitable victory of their hallowed imperial forces. And their nation. Get outta way! Get a move on! Clear the way! Pull this thing over! C'mon move outta the way! Sorry bout that! Captain! Carry on! C'mon! C'mon! Get outta the road! Hey! Clear the way! God damn, many Japs! This time tomorrow! The camp's gotten be overflown in no time! Just a few days, those yellow monkey's in the mountain gonna be history. You know their orders are to stop us no matter what. This Japanese soldiers are tough. They don't give up. You have no idea what you're talking about, Corporal. I'll advise you to keep your opinions to yourself. Right, sir. Dammit! Watch it! Hey! Take it easy, Corporal! Or I'm taking the jeep and you're walking. You read me!? Yes, sir. Are you alright? Shit... - I should've stopped. - Look. They're just Japs, sir. They'll be fine. Every Japanese knows there's only once in a lifetime to be sincere. What's that mean, sir? The Japanese treasure every meeting for it. They never recur. If you pay attention. You might actually learn something while you're here. Where'd you learn your lingo, sir? You date a Jap girlfriend or something? I studied in Japan two years. Unfortunately, I never got around having a girlfriend. Bet you wanted to. Keep your eyes on the road mister. Yes, sir. The remaining troops are to evacuate immediately to matanza. Our, Imperial Japanese Army... Of the 43rd, division. Under the command of His Excellency Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito. Will prevail til the end. We will hold our line til the 4th of July. Is this the final offensive? Victory finally. The enemy will finally see our wraith. Command requires that only capable and those healthy to matanza. Those unwell are to stand down. That is all! Hold him tight! Hold on! Hurts doesn't it? I understand. Captain If I may... I do not wish to go to matanza. I want to stay and tend to the wounded. It's only right. I cannot leave them to the enemy. You're Louis. Yes, sir. Have a sit, Captain. We're not that formal here. Not in this damn place... Thank you, sir. I hear you speak Japanese. Well, the Japanese would say otherwise. I know the basic's, sir. Where' you from? Boston, sir. So you're a Ivy leaguer, huh? You could say that. I'll try not to hold it against you. I need your help, Louis. I don't understand this Japs. This a... Bushido and suicide thing... It's a... Well! It's crazy. Well, It's a... it's a matter of pride. It's a way of thinking. They've been nurturing in their heads for centuries. What? Kill themselves? Are you? Are you familiar with this, sir. Can't say that I am. What are they? Some kinda... Jap lucky charms? No, sir. Their shogi pieces. Their Japanese chess pieces. If you will. They all look the same except for the writing inside. So? Well... The only thing that differentiates your pieces from mine, is the direction their facing. Get to the point, Captain. Yes sir. Unlike our chess. If I were to take one of your pieces. I don't hold onto it. Waiting for you to reclaim it. I just simply turn it around. And use it against you. As part of my army. What the hell does that have to do with killing themselves!? The Japanese put a high price on loyalty to one's master. If one were to be taken prisoner. It would be expected behaviour for them to serve the new lord... With equal loyalty. Now if that were true. Why wouldn't they just surrender and fight on our side? Well, sir. If they were to be taken prisoner. There's a chance they could end up betraying their emperor. So they choose to die. Instead of taking the chances that might happen. You see, sir. The Japanese... Captain! I didn't come here to play fucking chess. Now if these Japs want to die? I'll be more than happy to oblige them. Honorably or otherwise. l just want to get this damn war over with. Are we clear? Crystal clear, sir. Little girl... She's running a fever. Drink some water. Enemies! Man the machinegun! Quickly! Get up! Attack! Here's the entrance! You're up! Frag that cave! Now he throws it in! Merry Christmas! Nips! Hold! - Cover the entrance! - Got it! Cave's clear! What'd you got? Got one! - Move out! - Yeah! yeah! - I want a belly man! - What's a belly man? Give it. I have two children of my own. Follow me. We need to get supplies from naval. Won't our army do that? Once the offensive is at hand. We won't have a chance. Naval command's not launching any offensive, so continue to hold the defense. We'll wait for the combined fleet to recapture the island. Arrival of the combined fleet will not be long. Who is this? My subordinate. Even without naval support? We are going to fight!? - Insolence! - Quiet! Keep your silence. Captain, I will tell the rest tonight. That even without naval support I am not afraid to die. I want to win the war. As do I! No! You just want to die. That's not true. Dying may be necessary. But not unnecessary sacrifice. Death will not ensure our victory! We must kill as many enemies to ensure our army's victory! Never forget this! I am addressing the officers and men to the Imperial Army on Saipan. For more than twenty days since the American devils attacked, the officers, men and civilian employees of the Imperial Army and Navy on this island. Have fought well and bravely. I expected that every man would do his duty. Heaven has not given us an opportunity. We have fought in unison up to the present time Despite the bitterness of defeat we pledge "seven lives to repay our country". Whether we attack or we stay, there is only death. Man who realize the true value of the Empire Utilize this opportunity to exalt true Japanese manhood. Saipan is the breakwater in the Pacific. Leave my bones on Saipan as a bulwark of the Pacific. As it says in the Senjinkun battle ethics, Never suffer disgrace and will offer up the courage of my soul. For the eternal life of the emperor and the welfare of the country! BANZAI! July 7th, 1944 On the day following the suicide of General Saito and his four commanders. The tattered remnants of the Japanese forces. Gathered near the western coast of the island for a final assault against the invaders. The Americans however, remained completely unaware of their movements. Keep us posted on a regular basis. You find anything out there, you boys will be interested in? I'll let you know. Come home normal. - Stay sharp. - Roger. - Mikey!? Let's go. - Coming, sir. I sure miss those Hawaiian gals. Oh yeah, those girls are sweet. Incoming! - Holy Shit! Japs everywhere! - We got company! Japs! Get to your firearm! Charge! Charge! Long live the Empire of Japan! Cover! Cover! Get on the horn! Able Victor Crow. This is Victor Blue. Can you read? Victor Blue. This is Able Victor Crow. Go ahead, over. Look out This is Victor Crow! We getting a god damn Jap banzai attack! - We'll be trying to hold them back! - Get the Captain... Get the, Captain! Captain!? Requesting immediate fire mission on my mark! 1 stick 4 items! I say again! 1 stick 4 items! Fire for effect...! C'mon! Get outta here! Victor Blue. Repeat last transmission. Over. Victor Blue. Repeat last transmission. Over. Mike! Get your ass up! We're going in the field! Captain. That's kravits. - I think it's been overrun. - Shit... Find out what's going now. On the 7th of July. And what came to be known as the Banzai Attack. Over 4,000 Japanese and close to 2,000 American lives were lost in a space of over 2 hours. Two days later, the American commanders would declare a total military victory on the island of Saipan. Keep your eyes open! Check em' out! Could be some live ones! So you fear death? Who are you? Speak of the dead. Horiuchi, Kesamatsu. Private First Class. Here! Near Mt Tapochau. It's a place the Japanese are calling the Valley of Hell. It was here that General Saito along with his other commanders here committed suicide in front of their men. And they did this the night before they launched the attack. The night before!? That's right, sir. The night before the attack. They want to die for their god emperor. Though they just assume, take us with them. They kill themselves... The night before hitting the battlefield. What sense does that make!? Well, by dying this way in front of their men. They're showing their men the way. They're setting an example. Continue, sergeant. Now up here. Marpi point. Calling these cliffs, the Banzai cliffs. Because apparently civilians are throwing themselves into the rocks in the sea below. Women, children and entire families are killing themselves, sir. Women and children? Why!? Seems that the Japanese military has told them. That we Americans are cannibals and torturers. They are terrified, sir. The Japs has lost their commanders. And we've crushed their armies. Now I tell you boys. The end is in sight. Thank god for that. Because this must stop now! You're right colonel. But I feel we can't be too optimistic about this. This is still a volatile situation. l'd like to try to convince them to surrender, sir. You want to talk to them? They have no more food left. With no fresh water on this island. They've also got nothing to lose. l refuse to lose even one more men on that mountain! You've got one month, Captain! After that! I'll blow them all to hell. Thank you, sir. Hey! Water! Water! Open Open Where? Live. Captain. Kind as you are. This may expose us to the enemy. The enemy may save this child. And the price for that is our death? How could this line We Mania is to retrieve only to fight come on Ah this is really a dilemma What kinda name is that? Kellangly. - You don't look italian. - Check those bodies. Navajo, sir. - Articquelly - You two over there by the shed! Means troublemaker. Grandfather rode with roosevelt and the roughriders in Cuba. Meet my grandmother in Cuba. Now that's trouble. Fact. You don't mind if l call you trouble? Everybody else does. Guys hear that? Probably a trap. I don't think you should go in there, sir. Thank you, sergeant. Let's make sure we get this little guy some help, huh? Yes, sir. He's got your eyes, sergeant. Make sure no to lose him on the way back to camp. Get him some water. How you suggest I do that? You take your thumb. You're gonna dip it in your canteen. And you're gonna let him suck on it. Just like you do. Shut up! You want Japs to hear you? Now spread out and finish clearing the area. Move! And take that damn thing off your head. Captain? Captain's alive? You're guys alright? Captain's back and we're be better. Stand... Salute! Toshio of 1st Battalion, 18th Regiment. I'm Oba. We're on our way to base camp, western slope of Mt Tapochau. We'll use the dense jungle. Even light hardly penetrates. Best for concealment. Look at this! What is it? Here. American devils been here. Why are we delaying? Ambush. How are we sure they're cross here? It's the only road leading to Marpi point. And my gut feeling. Alright take five! Anyone got any water? Here. I've got a little. Private, how many times have I got to tell ya. About the marvels of water conservation? - Sergeant, it was full this morning. - You're fucking useless! You go without it. You get me killed. And I'm coming back and I'm gonna kill you. - You got it? - Yes, Sergeant. Take a load fuckin... Grenade... Grenade There's another one over here, LT... Sergeant? There's a hidden path over here. Fucking yellow monkeys. How stupid do they think we are... Well. What are you waiting on? Alright. Let's see what this takes us. C'mon. Get. Let's go... Watch your spaces... Quiet... Munroe? I don't like this. Let's get outta here. Everyone fall back! - Attack! - Incoming! - Aim high! - Cover me! Look out Fall back! Cease fire! l suppose you're gonna try and tell me the Japs did this on purpose. Well, sir! They just disappeared! Check the wounded! He's gone, sergeant. Is smoke also in your calculations? Coincidence. Show yourself! Hold your fire. Who are you? Kazuo Oshiro. How many people live here? I have not done a count... Maybe about... 200. 200!? We have got storages of food, Drugs from a hospital. And a nurse's station. I heard the words to the shelter will endure hunger and torture There are many people stranded here Marine Corps, lieutenant Kinbara. Nagata. Sakae Oba of the 18th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army. What's the weapons and ammunition sitrep? 1 light machine gun. Few launchers and 20 rifles. However. We've got 5 U.S. M1 carbine. 10 pistols and ammo. We're ready to engage the enemy! We will use the mountain as base. And conduct guerilla style raids. This will be one of our military base camp. Yes! I hope you will fight bravely. Captain? Why can't you led us here? Our mission is... to take out as many enemies as possible. You lot are disillusioned. Why you... Leave her. They're heading towards the camp. Back to camp! Yes! Stretcher! Stretcher! Tragedy. hold! Get him up. Move! I'm sorry. Out of the way! Look what've you done. Verify the number of surviving civilians and soldiers Yes! Scout for an alternative. We need another location to accommodate 200 people. Yes! Right now! We have 100 soldiers and 86 civilians. We are already looking for an alternative camp site. Under the command of Captain Oba. We will worked out 3 locations. 1st location will be here! 2nd alternative is to the western slope of Mt Tapochau! 3rd alternative is to the Death Valley! - Speed up! It's getting dark! - Yes! Please be aware of your surrounding, and not let your families wander off. Transition to the camp site will soon be completed. Kazuo? I have come to realize. That the civilians and the rest of the soldiers. Is our duty. I finally understand. Oh. Very detailed. I taught geography in school. Are we located here? You can read? I know where the mango is. Very good. You and sister can mark it out. Alright. I can also teach the children. What's wrong? Hungry... Saying it makes you more hungry. You can't eat a raw snail. You have to boil it first. Those hidden in Mt Tapochau! Japanese soldiers and civilians! We will not harm you! The U.S. army will not harm you! Lay down your arms and surrender! Feels nice. C'mon in! Feels wonderful! Quit moving around. Don't listen to the Captain Oba. Why? Because he's, commands is like a God's. Oba and God are in the same league. You there! Stop it! - Get him out! - Yes! Crazy bastard! God said to me. God love you too. - Take him away. - Yes! Quiet! I heard he was a Priest. Losing his mind. Captain Oba! Alright. You try. C'mon! You doing it wrong! Relax your shoulders! Tuck your knees in! That a girl! Hey! Horiuchi. Didn't I warn you not to approach the camp? Align your sight to the tip. Tuck your knee, Aono. Knees. Knees. Alright! Straighten up! Straighten! Shit! Damn! You really pulled the trigger! Dammit! Thank you. Please continue. Eh... Your name's Chieko, right? Try not to act like you're one of the soldiers. Call me Aono. Everyone does. The only thing I want for myself. Aono is. To kill U.S. soldiers. Captain, how old are your children? Much older. I see... I do not know the child. Been looking after him since his mother was sick. I'm not worried when you are the parent. Neither am I worried. When you are our Captain. We are grateful for someone such as yourself. Food for thought. How much do we have left? Don't think about this. Yes! They will return. We need to relocate. Fast! We move to the 2nd alternative tonight. What about the food supplies? Move them out separately. Regretful. Just settle for some normally and this happens. Now we have to give it up. How much further? It's here. The base of the mountain that we spotted the camp. Anything from the grasshopper? The last report: There's no signs of life. Japs must've gone up. What about the other side of the mountain? Can they even make it over the coral ridge? One thing's for certain. They're gonna leave a pretty big trail. Let's hope so. Alright! Munroe. Move out! They must've know we were coming. Hey! Water! Wait! There's no fresh water on this island! Oh my god! Captain? Oh, Jesus Christ! How you doing pal? Where's they... Disappears into the mist? And then he baits us for water? And we don't even know what he looks like? - Sergeant. - He's a fucking fox. Sergeant, take it easy. Save your energy. You take care buddy. l have a problem. And you can bet! You fucking me if l have a problem! You now have a problem. l've just received an ass chewing from Washington! The brass is wondering why they've received reports of enemy activities on Saipan!? An island that I assure them that we had secured! Over 4 months ago! Now I would like to report back in the not too distant fucking future! That all enemy hostilities has ceased on this island! Gentlemen. We will hunt. And we will destroy. Any and all opposition on that mountain. Within the next 7 days. Further! I'm hearing some kinda nonsense! About a Japanese officer who thinks he's too smart to be caught! A Fox! Sir. Say again? Some of the men says. He's smart like a fox, sir. Some of the men says. He's smart like a fox, sir. Bullshit! That is complete and utter bullshit! Even if there's a guy up there running the show! I will tell you this! He will be gone. Gone. Gone straight to hell. In under a week. l promise you that. The enemies' area of operation is limited to 4 miles long and 3 miles wide. Around the base of the mountain. These 200 so Jap soldiers are hold up in this area. And l know! I have your assurance that every last one of them will be flushed out. You will make a full division sweep of the whole god damn area. I want a line. 3 miles wide and marines at arms length. Forget about the Japs. Anything that?s moving or alive. I want found. l want those Japs in custody or in the ground. Good luck, gentlemen. Huge lines of Americans outflanking us. The situation will quickly spiral out of control. We need the civilians out of the way. We need to assure the civilians are safe. Mt tapochau's eastern side are endless stretches of cliffs. But there are caves interjecting the cliffs. We will keep the civilians out of harms way there. Slowly The caves are camouflaged by the treeline. They will be safe there. Those searching the jungle will never find them. It's our only way. C'mon. I am sorry. - Slowly. - Mother. What is it? Okuno's not going up. My mother's too old and frail,.sir She's afraid of heights and claustrophobia. She will give you trouble inside. Fucking... You guys got anything down there? - Nothing here! - Alright! Move out! What about that area at the base of the mountain!? Over! - Yeah! Okay... - See anything? - I'm not feeling well. - A little while longer... I'm uncomfortable. Incoming! Shit! How many!? - You gotta be... - Here they come! C'mon! Go, go...! - Go, go, go! - He's on me! He's on me! - Keep firing! Shit! - Ambush! - That guy's behind that rock! - Move it for the right! - To your left! - Move! Move...! Grenade! Let's take a look at how we did. Captain! What have we gained? All those marines at our disposal. We captured six scared civilians! Killed 3 Jap soldiers! And lost 11 U.S. marines! We failed. We underestimated, sir. underestimated? We couldn't even find them! For the Christ's sake! Who is this Fox character? Louis? What is his fucking name? ls he some kinda magician? ls he Harry Houdini!? He's responsible for the booby traps. And he's probably the one who marked the baby first to find. Colonel. He's a clever man. Clever my ass. What do you think the brass is gonna say? We did shit! That's what they're gonna say. And they be right! Get outta my fucking office! Don't hate the military... Iron rice bowl and chopsticks... Unfortunately, not Buddha... For a meal. Really good for nothing... Nothing like some labour work. I am that kinda person. That's right! I'll kill one hundred American soldiers. How about killing 31. If I kill 10 everyday. I'll achieve lots in a week. What are you doing? I want to kill them all. Excuse me? I heard you had a woman here that knows about the fox. The fox. What fox? All the civilians we brought down from the mountain? They're all civilians here, captain. You can't go in there. Haruko? I am Haruko. Sorry. It's alright. I would like to inquire about the fox? Fox? The Japanese commander of Mt Tapochau. That is your commander? He left a red marker for the rescue of a baby. Is he a good commander? Are we talking about the same person? You call him... the fox? Captain Oba. Oba? Oba, the commander. Commander. l still don't get the japs, captain. Captain Sakae Oba. 18th imperial infantry. The fox. That's his name, colonel. Is that a fact? Take care, Louis. Good luck, sir When you get this Oba character. You tell him something for me. Yes, sir. What's that sir? You tell him Tell him he's a son of a bitch. Be sure to let him know, sir. Attention! Breezy! Take me to the airfield. Yes, sir. Dismissed! You know the 1st thing that I did when I found out I was assigned to Saipan. Was to grab that fishing rod. May never use it but at least I can think about it. Well. I hope the day would come that we can all go fishing can come sooner or later, sir. So do I, captain. So do I. It's no secret you know more about this place then I do. l would like to hear your thoughts. Tell me what you know. Well, sir. We've been carrying out the director's from the psych warfare boys in an effort to get them to surrender. We've had... some success with individual stragglers but... Not with the larger groups we think that are still hiding out in the mountain. Sit down. What would you do differently? Well, sir. I'd like to continue with this. But I would like to make some on our own. Tailored specifically to the holdouts on this island. And we have to stop using the words Toko. The Japanese are very proud people and they wouldn't want to surrender. I'm aware of that, captain. Go on. We need to give them a way out without shaming themselves. Perhaps tell them to cease resistance rather than surrender. Alright, captain. Right now you pursue that coarse of action. But just know that our time is limited. That's all! Dismissed. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Captain? You seem to have a understanding of this culture. What is at the heart of this absolute commitment. The Japanese have to no surrender? Are you familiar with this, sir? I would like to save the lives of the Japanese people in the mountains. I do not want any more to die. I'll be sending messages by plane dropped flyers. Think about it? For myself. Due to the invading Americans. I have lost friends and family. My two sons are dead. We decline. Captain. l don't want Japan or America. To further engage in this unnecessary war. l would like to help. Don't pick it up! That's enemy propaganda! Leave it! What's this? Is it real? Photos of Tokyo. Bito? You were born in Asakusa, right? I'm not sure... But it's near the Ginza. Tokyo has become like a ghost town. Kazuo? Yes. I have seen the photo on the flyer. Know any of the civilians in the shelter? Oba. Akio. C'mon. Two days ago. Leaflets was dropped. The photo on the flyer... Is it real? I had a hand in producing the flyer. This photo is not the only one. There are others. Numerous horrific photos of Japan. It is to make you understand. Make the transition now. This is a good time as any. We... will not respond to claims in the flyers. Please reconsider, captain. I heard, There's enough bombs to destroy the whole of Japan. Everyday the planes take off from this island. Oba? May I enquire? Up in the mountain. Are there a pair of siblings? Yes. Wonderful? Great. They are my children. We got separated. I have never seen them since. Please take care of them. Oba? Do you have time? Here. Look at him before leaving. Safe? Captain. Leave. - Please... - Who was that!? - I don't understand... - What was he doing? Take a look! - I got nothing! - Check the windows! - No one's here. - You got anything? What was Oba doing in the can? Gathering information and supplies. He was trying to - verify some photo. - And? l told him, it was true. He was shocked. Colonel. I think we need to try something more aggressive to get them to surrender. Such as? We should promise them. Food and medicine. - When they come, we set a trap and capture them. - No... no. Absolutely not! That wouldn't be honorably nor very effective. lf we do that. The others left on the mountain will never surrender. Colonel, treachery here is not the answer. Motoki. I will go up the mountain. Please translate that I will convince the commander to surrender. Mr. Baba says. He will go up the mountain. And convince them to come down. Well, Mr. Baba. If a Japanese person like yourself can convince them to down down. I'm happy to have you try. Perhaps a little Japanese to Japanese talk will do us all some good. At this point, we have nothing to lose. The colonel agrees. Thank you. Captain, you have my permission to do whatever you need to do. To bring about a better peaceful resolution. Please make sure Motoki- san here, gets whatever he needs to. Ito? Ito! We're out of medicine and bandages. How do you expect me to work this way? Cool down. We are privy to the lack medical supplies. Don't you understand!? I could've done a lot more with drugs! I have also lost comrades! Enough! Both of you. We can get the drugs and medicine from the shelter hospital. I find out what else we need. So let him go with me For the drugs... I will find a way. - Commander? - Move it! Faster! Walk faster! Move! This bastard is a Yankee lackeys. Baba? Why are you here? I'm here to convince you to surrender. Do you think we're weak!? Stop! The Americans put you up to this? I would like to see my children... You're not here to see your children. You're here to sniff out our defenses. I want to see the children! I want to take them back! Is that! wrong? Shut up! Traitor! You have shamed Imperial Japan! Stop your tears. Your children will never look up at you again. Leave. Oba? If my children are killed. I will never forgive you. Aono, what is it? Where are we going? Gonna show me something? Here? I need to know? What? Please wait outside. I will call you. If he agrees to meet with you. Okay. But if and only if he agrees. l don't want him to think that we're trying to track him. Of course, captain. Don't worry about us. We'll stay outta your way. Thank you. Quickly... Wait... It's time. This is most helpful. Oba? Would you not reconsider? Enough! We will fight to the last breath. In fact, I have brought the U.S. captain. Fall back! No... believe me. Get back! Get back! Get em' clear! Go...! C'mon! Let's go! Don't shoot! Stop! You don't understand! Don't shoot! - Fire! - Men down! Fire! Fire...! Cover! Hey. Cover! - Japs through the fence! - Japs on the left! Get em' ...! Aono! Captain! Fallback! Going into the trees! Cover! Cease fire! Cease fire! - The hell just happened? - Alright! Check these men! - Yes, sir! - l don't know. Reverend's not gonna make it. Somebody's over here! Let's get these guys to the hospital. Captain. You alright? I'm fine. A traitor? What? Traitor's Japanese. Horiuchi's dead. Aono... may still have a chance. We must not let the civilians go to the shelters? We mustn't! They will only be a pawn for the enemy? They're be killed. Food and medicine are in short supply. We can no longer take care of them. Think of the civilians. Wouldn't it be better for them in the shelter? Captain. Though you are the commander. You are no different from the enemy. I beg to differ. I believe. Japan will once again set foot on this land. And when that time arrives. I hope you will. Often recall. Mount Tapochau. During this time that we have stayed together. And through everything we've endured. The memories will not be in vain. Bring these back with you to Japan! Oshiro? It's been an honour. Truth is. I'm relieved to leave. C'mon. TO OUR GOOD AND LOYAL SUBJECTS: We have ordered Our Government to communicate to the Governments of the United States, Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that Our Empire accepts the provisions of their Joint Declaration. Emperor Hirohito's announcement of Japan's unconditional surrender was recorded and later broadcasted to his loyal subjects. Here too at Camp Susupe. This is impossible! This is propaganda! They have time and again used this tactic. In order to make us believe. Enough of this nonsense! Ikegami? Why are you back here? Captain has given his best. Faced with numerous challenges. I'm sorry we. I did say we'd win. Isn't that what I said? I don't recall. Well. You're wrong. Just returned. Security at the shelter have become complacent. We can penetrate effortlessly. Find out why? Due to the brainwashing by the American's. Majority of Japanese believed. 6th August. Hiroshima. 9th August. Nagasaki. A new bomb was detonated. Cities and towns were destroyed Countless dead. That's why.. His Majesty, the Emperor. Declared down of arms. Japan. Lost. Fight to the last breath! Remember our commands! Even with the knowledge of Japan's total copulation. Neither Oba nor his men are willing to come down off the mountain. You wanted to meet me, colonel? Yeah! Come in, captain. according to a message from the Japanese camp. Oba is saying that he wants to meet. Oba does? Has he agreed to surrender? No. He wants to meet with the representatives of the American armed forces. Captain Oba is nothing if not consistent. He wants it his way right til the bitter end. I like to be the one to meet him. If you would permit me, sir. Permission granted. Thank you, sir. You admire him. Don't you, captain? I do, sir. Where you learn english? ln Singapore. Because of war. You speak good english.
