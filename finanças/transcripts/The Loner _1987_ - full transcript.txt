THE LONER Apparently, Léon sold his bar. Really, what an ass. You seem nervous. Look, Big Zaza has moved. I heard he works at a bank during the day. Hard to recognize. I bet. I've seen him in a golf outfit. - Hello, Commissioner. - No customers yet, tonight? The assholes. We're freezing here. - They could have brought rolls. - Why not hot meals? - What's all this? - What? The seafood, everything. Quite a change from rolls. - Try it. Don't you like it? - Yes, but I'd like to understand it. I wrote the letters of resignation. I only need the signatures. - Some people will be happy. - They can drop dead. As long as we change our lives. - Are we doing something stupid? - Of course. What does your kid say? Christian? He loves it. He knows the Antilles from TV and sees himself on a surfboard already. - Shall we go to Katia at the New York? - For work reasons? Cops are allowed to have some fun too, aren't they? Hello, Commissioner. - Hello, princess. - Thanks for Eric. It's all solved. As long as he behaves, or else I won't miss. - Where did you buy land again? - On the Antilles. Would a hotel do well there? - The land has already tripled in value. - Do we look like hotel owners? You don't, but you can work in the kitchen. One sausage with fries, two fried eggs and the bill. Nice atmosphere. Hello. Isn't Stan with you? How are you? A drink? I heard you're going to leave us. - We'll miss you. - There's a new generation now. They can't wait. - I know the type. They don't have that little something that almost makes you pleasant. Charm and class. They don't make men like us anymore. - Won't you regret it? - No way. - We'll miss your eyes and your smile. - And your champagne. Cheers. Well done. These gentlemen are leaving. - To the Antilles, like two old fags. - It's in fashion. I have to go. Will you take your son? Doesn't he go to school? Aren't there schools everywhere? We'll be missing the illiterates soon. - Well, Jo? - I keep my word. - What do you have then? - Schneider. I saw him come in ten minutes ago. I recognize him after 18 months in the slammer together. - Merci. - Sure. - I've done what I had to do, right? - Yes, your conscience is clear. - Schneider's here. - Schneider? Where? Stay here. He tricked me once, but he won't do it again. What do we do? Let's go. - He's having fun. - Won't be for long. - Don't you recognize me, Mr Stan? - Get lost. I have a nice drugs case for you. I know who they are. They're rip- offs. Go get yourself an ice cream. What do you want? They're stealing my car! This way. - Another one. - Yes, but this one... What can I say? Do you know the bastard who did it? - How did it happen? - What does it matter? You'll have to write a report. - Didn't he have a son? Christian? - Yes. I'm his godfather. - And the mother? - Disappeared after birth. To the Commissioner of the National Police. I hereby offer you my resignation... as per 1 December 1984, after completion of all my tasks. A police man never mourns for long. Two years have passed and I'm Head of Crime Prevention. I'm the only one who knows why I stayed with the police. To pay back Schneider for what he had done to Simon. - Morning, boss. - Hello, ladies. - The Director wants to see you. - Put him on. Don't forget your press conference, Stan. What do you want me to say to them? That you declare war on the criminals. They like to hear that. Such imagination. Very original. Hello, all. Give me a number, Commissioner. - You bring me luck. - Four or two. - Seven. Great. - There you are. I want a report about the Yougos in the Rue Ordener, Mordin. With your usual competence. Zanijevo and Jaslevic. The pimps. Use some nice sentences. And don't forget to add that Commissioner Pezzoli is an idiot. - 'Inconsistent' might be more subtle. - That's up to you. If we ever get a prize for literature, it'll be thanks to you. Apparently, Schneider's back. - How do you know? - From the usual sources. We'll see. Are you there again? You can't stay. I'm your godfather, not a hotel. - What's wrong this time? - The teacher's an idiot. - He mistakes a 3 for an 8. - You already used that one. - I want to stay with you. - You're as stubborn as Simon. - But I have to work, kid. - I won't cause any problems. Come in then. I'll cook, uncle. - You must be the new Bocuse. By the way, don't call me uncle. Do I have to call the school principal tomorrow? I won't keep making things up for you. - Is there no milk? - No, I don't drink milk. We won't keep doing this. Each time you get a bad grade, you live here for a while. Are you listening? - Where are the sheets? - In the cupboard. - If I talk too much, just tell me. - You're the only one I have. I know. But tomorrow you'll go back to boarding school. Did you know you're really good? No kid can look that sweet. You should teach me. - Uncle. - Yes? Can I stay for a while? You don't know when to stop. Let me read. We'll see tomorrow. - Asshole. - What did you say? It's a good thing it's you. - Got something to say, Sumatra? - I always tell you everything. - Then why don't I know he's back? - Who? Here, have some harissa. That will make you talk. You know Schneider's back. I heard something. All talk. I let you go so you could find Schneider for me. Don't you remember? I didn't want to disturb you for nothing. - Are you arresting me? - Why should I? We only lock up wolves. Not sheep. - So you're back. - As you can see. - I was homesick. - Come in. - Aren't you happy to see me again? - Yes, but it's dangerous. - For whom? - For you. Nice of you to be so concerned. - Are you talking to the cops? - That was Commissioner Stan. He's got me by the balls since the New York case. He knows you're in France. He wants to get you. That's why I worry about you. A man of you calibre should not die from fear, Sum. Four, three, two. One, zero. Get out. - Have they started? - 15 minutes ago. Excuse me, gentlemen. According to the only serious information we have... the money truck was held up by a bunch of gypsies. Amateurs. My informers will make sure we catch them soon. - They're petty thieves. - Petty thieves? You'll be surprised. I only know one person who kills his victims like dogs. Schneider. Schneider again? We have enough of him after two years. He must be working via satellite. From Caracas. He'd rather stay in Venezuela than go to jail here. Pezzoli should worry about his whores and his pimps. - I'll look after the money transport. - All alone, as usual. You have to start to understand that police work... isn't just about walking around with a gun on your ankle. I like westerns, but only in cinema. Alright, idiot. Very funny. - Can you hear me, position V1? - He just left in a grey BMW. This is V2. The BMW's now in the Rue Verniquet, direction Porte Maillot. Our friend's coming back with two men. They're getting into the BMW. We'll follow. This was V3. V3 here. What do we do, boss? I'm right behind them. Stay behind me. Untie the handcuffs. What were you doing in that arms depot car? I only had a P.38. I don't know about the others. I didn't ask. You were too discrete. Is he disturbing you? Leave us alone, Eric. - I didn't say he was disturbing me. - Now it's just you and me. We don't need any peeping Toms. I've got some pictures. Crédit Lyonnais Bank. Boulevard Magenta. 17 March 1985. The CCF Bank. You're getting in your car. The Vernes Bank in the Rue La Fayette. Nice close- up. You look a bit tense. You should smile as you pull the trigger. - He just looks like me. - A doppelganger. Good idea for your defence. Your lawyer will be able to use it. He's wearing a beret. I never wear a beret. You lost, René. You'll go behind bars for a while. Your wife won't wait twenty years. Only mothers are that patient. - I was raised in a children's home. - Now your future's ruined too. What do you want? Aren't you wondering why we let you rob banks all that time? Don't you ask yourself that? Why we didn't do anything... while we were watching you all the time? - Schneider's back and you know it. - I don't see that sicko anymore. He killed Sumatra without a reason. He's a danger to everybody. - So tell me where he is. - I can't. I waited 2 years for Schneider's return. I'll get him no matter how. I never see him anymore. I know he works with gypsies. I'd be happy if I never saw him again. And even happier if you tell me where he is. And you'd be free. You help me, I help you. I don't do deals like that. I can't help you with Schneider. That's a pity. René Pignon. Well done, Commissioner. I was looking for him. - Good evening. - Good evening. Aren't you alone? Whose kid is that? That's not a kid, it's a gnome. No, he's my godchild. Say hello to each other. - Hello. - Hello. You're nicer than the one from yesterday. The girl he brought home yesterday. - Was there a girl here yesterday? - A tall blonde. She even fried eggs for breakfast. - So she spent the night? - Yes, they kept having fun. Shall we go? Look after the house, gnome. Don't call him a gnome. And if you need to go out for dinner... why don't you call your blonde? I'm sure she'll be delighted. Brigitte... - Did you say something to her? - No. Stick to your own little girlfriends and leave mine alone. - That way, we'll be fine. - Alright. Are you angry? - What did you tell her? - That there was another girl yesterday. I'll have a great love life with you around. I'll make us some chow. Hello, gentlemen. Your papers too, Kouébi. - You know mine are ok. - That's why I like you. I don't need to see yours, of course. The asshole will be right here. Get in the back. - Why did you do that, Stan? - Don't call me Stan. - They'll kill me. - I'm listening. I only know about a dope deal at Kadour's in Belleville. I don't care about Kadour. You know what I'm interested in. Apparently, the money transport's a job by gypsies. One of them's called Rocky. That's all I know. And they did it all on their own? With Schneider. A hooker told me. Do you know where I can find Schneider? They've seen him play at Carmonis'. - Are you working tonight? - No, I'm on sick leave. I've got a note from the doctor. If you can't get used to the French climate, I'll have you sent back. It's just an ordinary flu. That's good, because I need you tonight. One moment. - I'm happy to see you, Commissioner. - Really? If you had warned me, we would have received you better. Our customers are rather jumpy. Poor people. Are they that sensitive? What can I offer you? That's not part of the deal. Things change, like in politics. I'm not a politician. I don't blame myself for anything. - And Schneider? - Fortunately, we don't see him anymore. I think there's something wrong with your eyes. Aren't you paying me? I was playing with that gentleman. Excuse me, but I should get half. Always the same thing in this fucking joint. - Easy, Commissioner. - Of course. Police, ID check. - What's happening? - They want to close the place. According to the Commissioner, Schneider was here. Nobody allows that madman in anymore. So why here? Maybe because you're afraid of him. What kind of game are you playing? Hide- and- seek. With a piece of shit. I could never stand cheaters. The older I get, the more I hate them. We're not cheating you. I hope so. Or you'd get some unpleasant visitors. - Did you talk about Schneider? - Not at all. Don't you see what that asshole's doing? Next time shut up, asshole. It looks good on you. - Would you like a drink? - It's been a long time. But you're still here. That's rare. Keep going, I'm coming. Hello, old Topaze. Still at your post? - Cheers. Everything alright? - Yes. Simon's son's staying with me. - Again? - He can't stand boarding school. But he can't stay, of course. He's a handful. If you want, I'll take him to Trouville for a weekend. I'd rather keep him home. He's only ten. - A couple of years too young for you. - Bastard. - You're exaggerating. - But I know you. - Do you know Schneider? - Yes, he's crazy. I'm looking for him. Have you seen him lately? Around three weeks ago. - Did he go up with a girl? - No, he brought one. A redhead. He was really into her. - Do you know her name? - Sandra, I believe. Apparently, she has a hairdressing salon in the Rue des Lombards. I know her. One moment. Did I wake you up, Serge? I'm on Schneider's trail. A hairdresser from the Rue des Lombards. Sandra. We must have a file on her. Are you on it? What are you doing there? - Stan, can I ask you something? - As long as it's a smart question. - What was my father like? - He was a nice guy. - Was he a good cop? - Don't say cop. - But he was a good cop. - I want to become something else. You're right. It's a crummy job. At first, it's alright, but... - Why did you stay then? - We never knew ourselves. - Why are you still doing it? - Because I don't want to give up. Your father wasn't able to finish a job. He'll hate that, wherever he is now. So I'm finishing it for him. Do you understand? I'm glad you're my godfather. I'm not, but that's the way it is. That's fine, gentlemen. He's yours. - Where are we going? - To get some fresh air. - Gone for a walk, René? - What are you doing here? I'm letting you escape for good behaviour. I didn't ask to be let out. You can't refuse a free offer like that. Yes, I want to go back to my cell. You can't do this. Strange, the last time I saw you, you looked really anxious. Like a horny woman who's afraid to get into a man's bed. - Strange comparison. - It's called a metaphor. If you ever want to write a book, you need to know that. Did you get me out to tell me that? Remember what we talked about the last time? - Not Schneider again. - Yes, Schneider again. You'll work with him again. And this time successfully. That's way too dangerous for me. He wants me to work with that madman again. Suicide. The alternative is to do time. Who knows for how long. He got you out. Enjoy it. I could also go abroad. He'll find you anyway. And you won't do well outside of France. You don't even speak English. Schneider had better disappear. When the Commissioner sees him... he'll light the fuse and wait. You have no choice. And we don't know you. We can only wish you good luck. Thanks, gentlemen. - How can we bribe this Stan? - We can't. - A shame. - I think he's going a bit too far. Sandra's 27. Good family. Father always worked for the railways. Anything else> A crook who sometimes uses her tanning booth. Aldo Benani. 1952. Born in Sottomarina, Italy. Pimp. One conviction. Got out twice due to technicalities. The robbery of the Société Générale in '82. He was there. Easy to recognize. No doubt about it. - I want Sandra here within 48 hours. - We don't have anything on her. - She must have drugs in the house. - What if she doesn't? In that case, a good cop thinks of something. I'm sure you can do that. Do you know anything about Pignon's escape? Everybody's talking about it. René Pignon? Escaped? We have so many other cases. Why? Pezzoli's turning it into a drama. If you know something, let me know first. If I hear something, I'll let you know. You know how much I like to help Pezzoli. Thanks in advance. - Are we going to Brigitte? - No, to Carole. A friend. Cut it out. And keep your mouth shut. If you start again like the other time, I'll make you regret it. - Is she in? - Of course. Super. This is my godson Christian. - Can you swim? - Yes, kind of. We'll teach you. Go put on your swimming trunks. - A cute kid. - But pigheaded. - Can you keep an eye on him? - He won't go far in swimming trunks. I didn't think you were the type for a child. You didn't forget next weekend? Of course, Deauville. - Did you make reservations? - Yes. But we'd better postpone it. - I don't see enough of you. - True. I'll call you. Stan's nice. Yesterday he took me to the Chinese restaurant. We had meat balls and Brigitte taught me to eat with chopsticks. Brigitte? Assholes. You put the drugs there. The police wouldn't do something that low. The lab still has to establish if it's coke. Get lost. Go play the whore in the Bois de Boulogne. Good idea. You should work at an employment office. - Did you ever deal with us before? - I have a clean record. Good. That's rare these days. - But I interrogated you two years ago. - Three years ago. As a witness. That nasty business in Senliss. Sex parties and all that. - You happened to be there. - Yes, that's true. The honest truth. I like that. - Do you know this young man? - He's a customer. - His record's not so clean. - So what? - Do you see him often? - He comes for the tanning booth. For nothing else? I'm not a whore, you know. Ask Vice. What kind of dirty game is this? Do you want to see my cards? That was the Jack. Now the King of Hearts. Nice mug, no? I've never seen him. - Do you fuck with your eyes closed? - That's normal during orgasm. Do you close your eyes when they take you from behind? Easy, Morin. She just wants to give you some sexual education. I've got nothing to say to you. If I knew, I'd still not tell you. You're all bastards. You can move into a room with bars. - For drug trafficking. - I'll tell people about your methods. Only in the presence of your lawyer. Same old, same old. You won't be able to keep me for long. Inform the press of her arrest. That's good publicity for your salon. And if Schneider wants to visit you, I'll allow it. - Do you close your eyes, Morin? - When? Well, you know. Hello, cop. Yes, it's me. It's about time you let Sandra go. That's up to the magistrate. His name's Cardinal. Easy to remember. Make sure they let her go or you'll be in trouble, understood? - Get out. - What's wrong? None of your business. Get out. - What was that? - Nothing, go back to sleep. Women are strange. When I met mine, she was nice and cuddly. Very feminine, know what I mean? At first, the sex was great. And then she decided to lose weight. She followed all kinds of diets. - Is Christian still inside? - No everybody's gone. - Are you sure? - Yes, I just closed up. Police. Show your ID. I was starting to worry. - How did you get out? - Across the wall. - Hello, Inspector. - Do as he says and don't run off. I don't like cemeteries. Better be careful then. You sent quite a few people here. And think of all the widows that need to be consoled. - Grave widows, as they say. - I don't like your sense of humour. - What do you have to tell me? - Schneider contacted me. - You don't lose any time. - He's planning something. He needs men. And everybody's talking about my escape. We'll meet on Tuesday, at Châtillon Station. At noon. - We'll be there. - So will I. The more, the merrier, right? What do you want from me? Have you become an informer? I didn't tell him anything, Commissioner. I guess you visited the grave of Alfred de Musset. You're well informed. I met with Commissioner Stan. - Don't you work together anymore? - We tolerate each other. Hoping to screw each other over. That's why you'll tell me what you told him. Schneider's coming. Someone else's driving. Turn yourself in, Schneider. We've got you. I know you're there. Asshole. Rocky. Stop shooting. Bravo, Commissioner. I need to tell you something. - Thanks a lot. - Get lost. From now on, stick to your pimps and your whores. - Are we going to La Villette one day? - We sure are. And now we'll go on foot, because the elevator broke down. - What's a geode? - That's rather complicated. It's a kind of cave with walls covered with crystals. Stay there. - What's wrong, Stan? - Nothing, come. Where are we going, uncle? ...declares not to have noticed anything, except a woman... Wait, I'll call you back. What's happening? Look after Christian. Be good and don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. He's not feeling well. Open the safe. - I don't know the combination. - P.38. Six bullets. Bullet speed 442 metres per second. Is that enough? I think so. The bag. I saw you coming, Commissioner. I just put a money bag away. From the hold- up of the transport. Schneider? If something happens to me, tell the bosses. Only if something happens to me. - We found Aldo. - Schneider's right- hand man? - Where are we going? - To a sex party. Do you like that? What do you want? - Remove the bag. - No, I don't want to see your faces. - Commissioner Stan. Do you mind? - You're cops. - We want to see your boss. - I don't have a boss. - Where's Schneider? - Who? Don't act like a clown. You know who I mean. I don't understand a thing. You can only save yourself by talking. We can kill you. We'll say Schneider did it. I don't know where he is. He doesn't trust anyone. He calls me when he needs me. He must be showing himself somewhere. - He plays at Carmonis'. - Is that all? Wait. - Sometimes I go with him to Rocky. - The guy who joins you in the violence? I don't get violent. Where is this Rocky? He's got an apartment on the Boulevard de Belleville. Number 26b. Fourth floor. Yes, that's it. See that it's not so hard to cooperate? In jail, you can even let them fuck you to do them a favour. You might start liking it. Right. Feed the little birds. - Who's that? - Morin. - Christian's not alone, is he? - He's beating Orsoni at scrabble. - He's good at it. - He's a handful. But he's a great kid. I'm bringing you some food. You've been here for ten hours. Any news from Sandra? She's been temporarily released as you requested. But we lost her. She's slippery like an eel. I'm sorry, sir. What will you do after the Schneider case? - They say you'll leave. - They're just talking, Morin. You're not going to the Antilles? - What will you do with the boy? - Boarding school. So he runs away again. And gives me a hard time again. I'm getting used to him. He's funny. I'm glad you're staying. You're a bit rough, but I like your style. That's fortunate. That asshole Schneider keeps us waiting. - I hope Aldo's not taking us for a ride. - Schneider will be there. But when? Can I make a phone call? Rocky? It's me. I'm not coming. Aldo's been caught and must have talked. - How do we find each other? - Like always, only tomorrow. - Try to locate that call. - It was a bit short. - Where's Schneider? - I don't know him. - I'll rearrange your ugly mug. - I don't know anything. - He just called you. - Schneider? Did he? I promise you'll go to the slammer. You don't scare me, asshole. I was 14 when I offed my dad. The call came from a bar. 144 Avenue du Maine. We don't need you anymore. You'll go to the garbage bin. Handcuff him. Who made a call here ten minutes ago? Do you think I'd remember? - I think your memory's coming back. - A tall guy with... Michel Lazare. Has been in the hotel for a week. - He sometimes drinks coffee here. - Doesn't say a word. Good that you talk for two. - Lazare? - Room 24, second floor. Go inside and don't move. - Just shoot right away. - I feel like it, yes. But I respect the law. Two years ago, you killed a police man like a dog. I don't care. Do your job. Don't give me that crap. They used to kill you for that. These days, you pay... with at least twenty years. You'll slowly get old. Without a woman. Without anybody. You'll come out old and decrepit. Affected by the bad food. Ready for a nursing home. What if I escape? If you escape, I'll find you. Because you will pay. Up to the last cent. Get out of my car, damnit. Twenty years. To the last day. You can have him. Bravo, uncle. I thought you wouldn't call me uncle anymore.
