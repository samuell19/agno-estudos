I am 17, but pretty big compared to my age. Nice, I am so horny. I am up for almost everything. Wanna meet up now? Hi. It is you, right? From the internet? Ehm… yes. Hi, my name is Jacob. Hi. Do you have a name? Yes… ehm… Alexander. Hi Alexander. I am glad you came. So… okay? Or? - Yes, yes. - Cool. Then come. Where are we going? Thought we could go in here. It's just a place where we can hang out and have fun. Take it easy, it's not dangerous. I know. - Hi. - Hello gentlemen. So, have you been here before? You know how it works? - Yes, yes. - Good. - That will be a hundred each, thanks. - Yes. Can I borrow twenty? It's fine, it's on me. - Here you go… - Have fun boys. - Thanks. Come. What are you up for? Ehm… what are you up for? Guess. Oops! Come here. Do you come here often? No, not really. You are so beautiful. Thanks. And that body... I do swim quite a lot. And what about under you boxers, does that grow when you swim a lot. No, in that case you have to eat a lot of oatmeal. Well I guess you eat a lot then. I love Oatmeal. Sorry, I… I just had too. Is this all-new for you? Yes. Okay? Yes. - Okay? - Um... I can't. I have swimming class now. Hey Alex, let me know if you want to hook up again. Seriously Sebastian, when are we ever going to use the periodic system? In some kind of period I guess. We are never getting anything done if you don’t get yourself together. Is it Maria? No, it's not Maria. Good. She looks like a moron. Then what? It's…he is called Jacob. Jacob? Why haven’t you told me? You know I would have... Sara, he is so sweet and… Are you a couple? Yes. Is it somebody I know? No, he is older than we are. So, he isn't living with his parents and stuff like that? No, he…he has a very cool apartment. Hi Alex, I have been thinking of you. Actually my name is not Alexander. My name is Sebastian. Hehe. Okay, Sebastian suits you better anyway. Do you want me to come to your place tonight? Not today. It would be so nice to see you. Yes, I can't be at my place. Would you rather call it off? So, no boxers today. Fuck Sebastian, you are so hot. I want you so badly right now. Can I? Is it all right if we wait? Of Course. It's just… I have never been with a guy in that way before. I would love if I were the first one. I just wanted to be with a boyfriend. But aren’t we a couple? Yes. Can I? Yes. But I don't want to do it here. Why not? First time should be something special. It will be. I promise you. If it's going to be tonight, I want it to be at your place. Sebastian, It's not going to happen. Why not? Because my apartment is totally fucked up right now. Can it be worse than this place? This is going nowhere. Write me when you know what you want. Wait, I didn't mean it like that. Take care. What’s wrong? I haven't heard from him in several days. I was ready for him to be my first. But you have been together right? Yes, at a club. A club? A fucking nasty sexclub. A sexclub? What? Why not at his place? It just didn't happen that way… I don't want to do it at a club. Sebastian, he can't be in love with you. I know he is. So, why doesn’t he call? - Ten shots. - Which ones? - Tequila. - Yes. Thanks for coming with me. Of course. Just because you can't find a man yourself. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Hi. - Hi. I just had to come over and ask if I could buy you a beer? Hi. You look like you are having fun. Why haven't you written me? - No wait, Jacob? - Sebastian, let him go, he's an idiot. Shut up. Jacob. Jacob. Jacob. I don't know what happend in there. You are the only one I want. Well, that's a funny way to show it. What do you want me to do? Can we spend the night together? No. - Go on and play with your new friends. - They are not my friends. I just want to be with you. Please? Are you there? - It's Jacob. - Hello? Hello? It's Sebastian. Oh, Hi. I wrote you, but you haven't answered me? No, but I was busy with some stuff. Can I…Can I come to your place today? Ehm…You know what, it's not a good time, I have to do laundry. But it could just be very quick, just to say hi and…kiss you. That would be fine, but I am kind of in the middle of something so… So, then what? - I don't know Sebastian. - When can we meet? I don't know, we'll see okay? I have to go…take care... Bye. Bye. Yes? Hello? Hallo, who is it? It is… it's the paperboy. Sebastian, is it you? Yes. What the hell are you doing? You can't just come and ring my bell! Who is M. Silverbauer? Sebastian, go home. I thought we were a couple? Go home, Sebastian. I wasn't sure you would come. With that face, it was hard to resist. As you can see, I love oatmeal. You love oatmeal? Okay? Something wrong? No. Perpetual
