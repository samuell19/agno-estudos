I'm ninety-one. Is that so? Yes. You're ninety-two. Be that as it may. - Is that so? - It says so here. Well... What does it matter? Vanity is amazing. So's forgetting. I'm ninety-one. Ok. You're ninety-two. Oh, let it alone. - No! It's important. - It doesn't matter! It does to me. I know, Because he says, "you're exactly thirty years older than I am," I know how old I am because I know how old you are, And if you ever forget how old you are "Ask me how old I am, and then you'll know." Oh, he's said that a lot. What if he's wrong? What? Let it be. What if he's wrong? What if he's not Thirty years younger than you? You'd think he'd know how old he is! No, I mean, what if he's wrong About how old you are. Don't be silly. How couldn't he be Thirty years younger than me When I'm thirty years older than he is? He's said it over and over. Every time he comes to see me. What is today? It's Thursday! You see?! Well, one of you might be wrong, and it might not be him. - He. - Yes, I know. Don't be stupid. What is it? What day is it? It's Thursday! - No. - No what? No it isn't. Ok. What day do you think it is? What day do I...? What day is...? Well... It's today, of course! What day do you think it is?! Right on, girl! What an answer! What a dumb... Don't you talk to me that way! Well, I'm sorry! I pay you, don't I? You can't talk to me that way. In a way. What?! Indirectly. You pay someone who pays me. - Someone who... - Well, there, you see? You can't talk to me that way. She isn't talking to you that way. What? She isn't talking to you that way. I don't know what you're talking about. Besides.. There. Feel better? Honestly. A good cry lets it all out. What does a bad one do? Sometimes you're so... What?! Never mind. I was going to say something nice. Never mind. What did she say? She mumbles all the time. I don't mumble! Never mind! How is anybody expected to hear what she says? She didn't finish her sentence. It doesn't matter. I'll bet it doesn't. What I meant was You may have been incorrect about your age for so long, May have made up the fiction so many years ago, Though why anyone would lie about one year. Let her alone, let her have it if she wants to. - I will not. - Have what? Why you would lie about one year? I can imagine taking off ten or trying to. Though more probably five or seven, Good and tricky... but one! Taking off one year? What kind of vanity is that? How you go on. How you go on. How I go on. So, I can understand Ten, or five, or seven, but not one. How you do. How you do. How what? How she goes on. Yes! How you go on! Yes, I do. I want to go. On? I want to go. I want to go. You want to go? You want the pan? Is it number one? Do you want the pan? No, no, noooo! Ah. All right. Can you walk? I don't know! Well, we'll try you. Ok? You want the walker? I want to walk! I don't know! Anything! I have to go! All right! You're hurting me!! You're hurting me!! All right, I'm being careful! - No, you're not!! - Yes, I am! - No, you're not!! - Yes, I am. No, you're not! You're trying to hurt me, you know how I hurt!! Hold the fort. I will. I will hold the fort. I suppose one could lie about one year, Some kind of one-upmanship, A private vengeance, perhaps, Some tiny victory, maybe. I don't know, Maybe these things get important. Why can't I be nice? Made it that time. And... So it goes. Not always, eh? In the morning, when she wakes up, she wets. A kind of greeting to the day, I suppose. The sphincter and the cortex not in sync. Never during the night, But as she wakes. Good morning to the morning, eh? Something to something. Put a diaper on her. She won't have it. I'm working on it, but she won't have it. Rubber sheet? Won't have it. Get her up, Put her in the chair and she does the other. - Give her a cup of coffee... - Black. Half cream and all that sugar! Three spoons! How has she lived this long? Give her a cup of coffee, put her in her chair, Give her a cup of coffee and... Place your bets. What chair? This chair? You got it. Don't worry. It must be awful. For whom? For her! You're paid. It's probably awful for you, too, but you're paid. As she never ceases to inform me... And you. To begin to lose it, I mean the control, - The loss of dignity, the... - Oh, stop it! It's downhill from sixteen on! - For all of us! - Yes, but... What are you, twenty-something? Haven't you figured it out yet? You take the breath in... You let it out. The first one you take in, you're upside down And they slap you into it. The last one, well, the last one You let it all out and that's it. You start and then you stop. Don't be so soft. I'd like to see children learn it, have a six-year-old say, "I'm dying" and know what it means. - You're horrible! - Grow up! Do you know it? Do you know you're dying? - Well, of course, but... - Grow up. A person could die in there and nobody'd care. - Done already?! - A person could die! A person could fall down and break something! A person could die! Nobody would care! - Let me help you. - Get your hands off me! A person could die for all anybody'd care. Who is this person? A person could do this, a person could do... It's a figure of speech. No. Really? So they tell me. Hold on to me! Do you want me to fall?! You want me to fall! Yes, I want you to fall, I want you to fall and shatter in ten pieces. Or five, or seven. Where's my chair? Where's my chair gone to? Goodness, where's her chair gone to?! Somebody's taken her chair! What?! Who's got my chair? I'm sorry!...Your majesty! There's your chair. Do you want your pillow? Shall I get you your pillow? Fetch her pillow. I want to sit down. Yes, yes. Here we go. Which pillow? Are you comfortable? Do you want your pillow? Of course I'm not comfortable, Of course I want my pillow! - I don't know which one! - It's two, actually, One for the back and this one for the arm. Here we are, lean forward. That's a girl. My arm! My arm! Where's the pillow? Here we go. All comfy? All comfy? What? Nothing. - And so it goes? - Uh-huh. What a production. - You haven't seen anything. - I bet! You can't just leave me in there like that. What if I fell? What if I died? Well, if you fell I'd either hear you or you'd raise a racket, And if you died... What would it matter? You say that again! Alb: What's the matter with you? Who? Me? Yes, you. What's the matter with me? That's what she said. That's what I said. What are you all doing-ganging up on me? Is that what we're doing? Maaaybeee! There's nothing the matter with me. Well, you just wait. Wha-what, what did she say? She says there's nothing the matter with her, Miss perfect over there. I didn't say that, that's not what I... Wh-wh-why is she yelling at me? - She's not. - I'm not! - Now you are. - You see?! What it is, what day is it? It's Thursday. Will he come today? Is today the day he comes? No, not today. Why not? Oh, he probably has something else to do, He probably has a full schedule. He never comes to see me, And when he does he never stays. I'll fix him, I'll fix all of 'em. They all think they can treat me like this. You all think you can get away with anything. I'll fix you all. Is it always like this? No... It's often very pleasant. Huh! You all want something, There's nobody doesn't want something. My mother taught me that, Be careful, she said, they all want something, She taught me what to expect, Me and my sister. She prepared us... And somebody had to! I mean, we were girls and that was way back then, It was different then. We didn't have a lot, and being a girl... Wasn't easy. We knew we'd have to make our own way, And being a girl back then... Why am I talking about this?! Because you want to. That's right. She tried to prepare us... For going out in the world, For men, For making our own way. Sis couldn't do it, That's too bad. I could! I did! I met him at a party and he said he'd seen me before. He'd been married twice... The first one was a whore, The second one was a drunk. He... He was funny! He said, 'let's go riding in the park!' And I said, 'all right!' Scared to death. I lied, I said I rode. He didn't care, he wanted me, I could tell that. It only took six weeks. Good girl! We had horses when we were married, We had a stable, We had saddle horses, we rode. Hoity-toity. I learned to ride and I was very good. - I'm sure! - How are you sure? - Shhhhhhh. - I rode sidesaddle And I rode astride, And I drove ponies... hackneys And I loved it all. He would go with me and we would ride every morning, And the dalmatian would go with us... What was her name? Suzie! No. We had good horses and we showed them, And we won all the ribbons, And we kept them in a big case down in... In Down in, in the... No, that was the other house. We kept them. And, and cups. All the silver cups we won, And bowls, and platters. We knew all the judges But that's not why we would win. We won because we were the best. - Of course. - Be decent. Oh, she'll learn. We had horses! I knew all the judges, And I'd go in the ring when we were in the championships, And I'd sit there and I'd watch the horses, I never rode when we were in the championships. Earl did that. He was our rider. I would sit there and watch with the judges. They all knew me, we were famous, We had a famous stable. And when the judging was done They'd tell me if we'd won, And we almost always did, And if they told me, and they almost always did, I'd signal. I'd take my hat off and I'd touch my hair And that way they'd know we'd won. Who? Everyone in our box!! Oh, I used to love it, Riding in the morning, Going to the stable in the station wagon in my coat And jodhpurs and my derby, and petting... Oh, what was her name? The dalmatian? Suzie, I-I think... No, no... And mounting and riding off. Sometimes he came with me And sometimes he didn't. Sometimes I went off alone. Who? Her husband, most likely. Did you ride when you were little? No. We were poor. Poor? Really?...Poor? Well, no, not really poor, My father was an architect, He designed furniture, he made it. That's not an architect, that's... Let it be. He made such beautiful furniture, He was an architect. Strict, but fair. No... No, that was our mother who was strict. No, they were both strict. And fair. Now, now. I don't know what I'm saying! What am I saying? You're talking about horses, You were talking about riding, and we asked: When you were a little girl... We never rode, The neighbors had a horse But we never rode it. I don't think my sister ever rode. But I can't swim. She drank. When she was a little girl? Oh, please! What are we talking about? Horses. You didn't ride when you were a little girl. Oh, no... You rode if you were a farmer, Or if you were rich. Or if you were a rich farmer. Shhhhhhh. Ah... She'll learn. Won't you? Well, I dare say. I wasn't rich until I got married, And I wasn't really right then 'til later. It all adds up. We had saddle horses, we rode. I learned to ride and I was very good. I rode sidesaddle and I rode astride, And I drove ponies-hackneys... - And you loved it all. - Shhhhhhh! And I what? - You loved it all! - You loved it all. I did? So you say. Well, then, it must be true. I didn't like sex much, but I had an affair. Oh? What?! What do you want?! She doesn't want anything. We used to ride. He would go with me, Not all the time. Sometimes I went off alone, Or with the dog, part way, Never too far from the stable, She had a cat she was in love with. She'd go back, but I'd go on. I had my jodhpurs and my coat And my switch And my derby hat. I always rode in all my costume. Never go out, except you're properly dressed, I always say. I'd drive in the station wagon from the house, I loved to drive! I was good at it. I was good at everything, I had to be, he wasn't. I'd drive in the station wagon to the stable, And earl would be there, Or one of the stable boys... Tom... Or... Or... Bradley. Am I doing in my panties? Well, let's see. Upseedaisy! Nope, but I bet you're going to. Off you go. Hold the fort? Why am I doing this? Because it's unnecessary? Because I've already done it? The princess and the pea, maybe? What's wrong with her arm? She fell and broke it. It didn't heal. Mostly they don't at that age. They put pins in it, metal pins, Bone disintegrates around the pins And the arm just hangs there. - They want to take it off. - What?! The arm, they want to take the arm off. - No! - She won't let them. - I shouldn't think so. - It hurts! Still... What do you know? She makes us go into the city once a week to see the surgeon, The one who set it, The one who wants to take it off. God, he's almost as old as she is! She trusts him, she says. She goes in once a week, And she makes them x-ray it, and look at it, And each time the pins are looser, And the bone is gone more, And she tells the old guy, the surgeon, It's so much better, And she wants him to agree, and he waffles, And he looks at me and I'm no help, And she makes him promise that he'll never take the arm off, And won't let anyone else do it either, And he promises... Assuming she'll forget? Probably, but she won't. There are some things she never forgets. He promised me, you were there, you heard him. I think she says that every other day: He promised me, you were there, you heard him. Oh, god! Now, why did you do that?! You naughty, naughty girl! Bad, bad girl! What do I have to do-take everything away from you? Huh?! I broke the glass! I took the glass And I threw it down in the sink! I broke the glass and now She has to clean it up! Bad girl! I broke the glass! I broke the glass! I have to sit down! I can't sit down by myself! Why won't somebody help me?! All right, now! Jesus! You're a big help. I didn't know I was supposed to be. Just here from the lawyer, eh? Yes, just here from the lawyer. What? What did you say? I said... well, What I implied was, since she's here from the lawyer, Why should she behave like a human being, Why should she be any help, - Why should she... - You're from harry? No, harry's dead, harry's been dead for years. Harry's dead? When did harry die? Thirty years ago! Well, I knew that. What are you talking about harry for? You asked if I'd come from harry, you asked... I wouldn't do anything that stupid. And so it goes. Harry used to be my lawyer, But that was years ago. Harry died, what? Thirty years ago, harry died. Now his son's the lawyer. I go to him, well... He comes to me, Sometimes I go to him. Yes, you do. And yes he does. Why are you here? Some things have been... Misplaced, Aren't being done. Some things... somebody's stealing things?!! No no no no. We send you papers to sign and you don't sign them, We call you and you don't call back, We send you checks to sign and you don't sign them, Things like that. I don't know what you're talking about. - Well... - None of it's true! You're lying! Get harry on the phone! - Harry is... - Excuse me? The "I'll get to it" pile? What?! The "I'll get to it" pile? I don't know what you're talking about. - Papers? Checks? - Ooh, lots of stuff. - There's nothing! - What is there? What is it? You have a drawer full, The bills come and you look at them, And some of them you send on and they get paid, And some of them you say you can't remember - So you don't send them, and... - Why would I send in a bill For something I never ordered? And they send you your checks to sign? To pay bills? And some of them you sign, Because you remember what they were for, But some of them, some of the checks, you can't remember? I what?! You don't remember what they're for So you don't sign them and you put them in the drawer. So? These things pile up. I see, I see. Everybody out there's ready to rob me blind. I'm not made of money, you know. Yes, you are. - Isn't she? - More or less. They'd steal you blind If you didn't pay attention: The help, the stores, the markets, That little jew makes my furs... What's her name? Aw, she's nice. They all rob you blind If you so much as turn your back on them. All of them! We've asked you: Let all your bills come to us, We'll know what to do, Let me bring you your checks every month, I'll stay here while you sign them. Whatever you like. None of you think I can handle my own affairs? I've done it for... When he was so sick I did it all, I did all the bills, I did all the checks, I did everything. But now you don't have to. I didn't have to then, I wanted to. I wanted everything to be right, And I do now, I still do! - Well, of course you do. - Of course you do. And so I'll handle my own affairs, thank you. Well, certainly. And I'll watch you pretend to handle them. And I watch you, Every one of you! I used to love horses. It's just people you don't like. Oh? Is that it? We rode western saddle, too. It was when he almost died the first time, The first time I was with him. He had a blood infection. He was hunting, They were all hunting, And a gun went off and it Hit him in the arm, the shoulder. Oh my god! They shot him in the shoulder, And they didn't get all the bullet out, And it got infected And his arm swelled up like a balloon And they lanced it and it burst - And there was pus all over... - Stop! - Why? What's it to you? - And they put drains in it And there weren't any medicines then... - No antibiotics, you mean. - What? - No antibiotics! - Yes, And it wouldn't go away and it would get worse, And everybody said he was going to die, But I wouldn't let him! I said, 'no! He is not going to die!' I told that to the doctors, And I told him that, too, And he said all right, he would try, If I would sleep with him, If I wouldn't leave him alone at night, Be next to him, and I did. And it smelled so awful, - The pus, the rot, the... - Don't! Please! And they said take him to the desert, Bake his arm in the hot sun, And so we went there, we went to arizona, And he sat in the baking sun all day. His arm oozing and stinking, And splitting and... And... And in six months it went away And his arm went down in size And there was no more pus And he was saved, Except for the scars, All the scars, And I learned to ride western saddle. My, my. And it was outside of phoenix, camelback mountain, We used to ride out into the desert. And the movie star was there, The one who married the young fellow Who ran the studio, She had eyes of a different color. She had what? She had eyes of a different color. One eye was blue, or something, And the other one was green, I think. Who was this? Oh, she was a big star, She was tiny and she had a very big head. I think she drank too. You think everyone drinks. Merle oberon? No, of course not! You know! How long ago was this? - Claire trevor? - Oh... When I was there, When we were there. She was tiny! She had two eyes! - In the thirties? - Probably. She had a son, She cooked an egg on the sidewalk, It was so hot! He told me. Her son told you? No! Ours! He was a little boy, too, He played with all the other children, The chewing gum twins, that one! That must have been before the war. Which one?! Civil! Thalberg! That's who she married! Arnold thalberg, He was a real smart little jew. All smart jews are little. Have you noticed? Irving, irving thalberg. I'm a democrat, I notice a lot of things. Most of us are, most of us do. But still, it's fascinating, isn't it? Grisly, but fascinating. She doesn't mean anything by it-or if she did, once, She doesn't now. It just falls out. Norma shearer! A and b: Who?! What's the matter with all you people? We're democrats. What? Well, you asked what the matter was. Don't you get fresh! My god! I haven't heard that in a long time. Don't you get fresh! My mother would say that to me all the time. Don't you get fresh! To sis and me. She made us eat everything she put before us, And wash the dishes, She made us know what being a grown-up was. She was strict... But fair. No, that was our father, No, that was... Both of them. They're dead, Sis, they're dead! A smart little jew. At least she didn't say kike. She made us write thank-you notes, And take little gifts whenever we went somewhere, And made us wash everything We wore the night we wore it, By hand, before we went to bed. Sometimes sis wouldn't and I had to do hers, too. She made us be proper young ladies. And go to church twice a day? And pray a lot? What? Oh, yes, we went to church, But we didn't talk about it very much. We took it for granted, I suppose. How much did you steal? When? Whenever. Well... I waited until you were asleep... I never sleep. Until you were pretending to be asleep, And I went into the silver closet And I took down all the big silver bowls, And I stuck them up under my skirt, And I waddled out into the hall... Joke about it if you want to. You must have looked funny! Well, I suppose. Waddling out like that, You probably clanked, too. Yes, I'm sure I did. Clank, clank! Alb: Clank, clank! Clank, clank! You don't think anything's funny, do you? Oh, yes, I'm just trying to decide What I think's really the most hilarious, unpaid bills, Anti-semitism, senility, or... Now, now. Play in your own league, huh? Well! I'm sorry! I'll have to talk to harry about you. Harry's dead, harry's been dead for years. I know... I know. I don't have any friends anymore, Most of them are dead, And the ones aren't dead they're dying, And the ones aren't dying, have moved away Or I don't see anymore. Well, what does it matter? You don't like any of them anymore, anyway. That's true. But you're supposed to like them, To have them with you. Isn't it a contract? You take people as friends and you spend time at it, You put effort in. And it doesn't matter if you don't like them anymore, Who likes anybody anymore? You've put in all that time, What right do they have to... To... To... - To die? - What? What right do they have to die? No! To not be what they were. To change, you mean? - Let her alone. - No! No right! You count on them! And they change. The bradleys! The phippses! They die, they go away. And family dies, family goes away. Nobody should do this! Look at sis! What about her? My sister was a drunk. She was smarter than me... No... Brighter, Two years younger. Or five, or seven. - What? - Nothing. She always got better grades, had more beaus, When we were growing up, only then, She missed more boats Than you can shake a stick at. I've never shook a stick at a boat. Well, maybe you should give it a try. Shaken, not shook. We came to the city together, After she finished school, And we had a tiny little apartment, And our mother and our father came to see it, To be sure it was all right, not dangerous, I suppose. It was furnished, But he didn't like it, So he gave us some of theirs, Some from the garage. He made the most beautiful furniture. He was an architect. We went out all the time, Looking for jobs, Jobs a young lady could accept, Being escorted out at night. We were the same size, so we could wear each other's clothes, That saved money. We had little allowance, but a very little one, Nothing to spoil us. She was a little shorter, but not much. We kept a list so the boys, the young men, The... The men, who took us out, We went out with them together a lot, Wouldn't know we were wearing each other's... Is that what I mean? Yes, I think so, - Most probably. - Keep awake. "No, no, I wore that at the plaza, don't you remember? You'd better wear the beads." We had a regular list. We had big feet. - What?! - They had big feet. We had big feet. I still do... I guess. Do I still have big feet? Yes, yes, you do. Well, I'd never know. I think we liked each other. We used to confide a lot, And laugh, and... Mother would made us write Twice a week or call, later. We tried sending letters together, One letter together, but She'd make us send two, Each of us one. They had to be newsy, and long, And she'd send them back to us with things like, Uhm... Uhm... 'that's not true, ' or 'don't abbreviate, ' Or 'your sister said the same thing, ' If she didn't like them. Or spelling. Sis couldn't spell. She drank. Your mother? What? No, of course not. My sister! Of course. - Even then? - When? When you... When you first came to the city. No, of course not! Later. Well, we'd have champagne when we went out, Before the speakeasies. We would drink champagne, Nibble on candied orange rind. He brings me some, sometimes, when he comes. Or flowers-freesia, when they're in season. It's the least he can do. And he knows it! Who? Who is this? Shhhhhhh. Her son. We'd go out, but we didn't take each other's boyfriends. She was prim, I liked... Uhm, Wilder men, I suppose. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Why? Don't you? We never liked the same boys... Men. I don't think she liked men very much. Well, I know she didn't. We had to make her get married, when she was Almost forty, get someone for her! I don't think she wanted him, he was a wop. I don't believe it sometimes. Why not? Wop, nigger, kike? I told you, it doesn't mean anything. It's the way she learned things. From these strict but fair parents?! I have jewish friends, And I have irish friends, And I have south american friends... I did! Not puerto rican, or like that, But venezuelan, and cuban. Oh, we loved to go to havana. - Another world, eh? - Uh-huh. I've never known any colored... Well, help, yes. In pinehurst they had colored help And we used to visit them there. They knew their place, they were polite, and well behaved, None of those uppity niggers, the city ones. Oh, Jesus christ! He keeps telling me I can't say these things. I don't know what things he means. He said once, he wouldn't come To see me anymore If I said those things. I don't know what things he means. What did he mean? Don't worry yourself. Your sister married an italian. She did what? Oooh! Oh, that was later. I always had my eye out for the right man. And she didn't? No, she always thought everything would fall Right into her lap. And it did, a lot. I had to work for everything, nothing came my way. I was tall and handsome, She was tall and pretty. Tall but shorter, Not as tall as I am... Was. I've shrunk! I'm not tall! I used to be so tall! Why have I shrunk?! It happens with time, We get shorter. It happens every day, too, We're taller in the morning than we are at night. How?! The spine compresses as the day goes on. I don't have one. I used to have a spine, I don't have one anymore! What does she mean? She means osteoporosis. It hasn't happened to you yet? You wait! The spine collapses, you can fracture it by Walking, turning around... Whatever. I used to be tall! I've shrunk! I know. He was short. A lot of my beaus were tall, But he was short. Who is this? Her husband, I think. Oh, that's a long time ago. Oh, I knew such tall boys, such dancers. Sis and I would dance all night With all the tall boys. Some of them were showboys, they were fairies, But some of them were regular. We would dance the night away, And sometimes I'd go off. Naughty girl! I was the wild one. Sis would say to me, 'how can you do that?!' And I'd laugh and I'd say, 'oh, come on!' I liked to have a good time, But I had my eye out. I always had my eye out. If I don't have my eye out, who will? I've always had to be on my toes, Them sneaking around, Stealing and conniving. If I didn't keep my eye out, We wouldn't have had anything. His sister! That one she married? The first one! The dumpy little... Agh, Dentist was he? What did he know about running an office? What did he know about handling money? Enough to steal! Enough to line his own pockets. And of course the old man Kept his head turned The other way because the..., What's his name, the dentist Was married to his precious daughter! Oh that one! Whining and finagling, Wrapping him around her little finger! I had to stay one step ahead Of all of them! I fixed 'em! Did you? What? Did you fix them? Who? Wha-wha-, what are you talking about? The ones you fixed! How do I know? I don't know what you're talking about! Fix who? I don't know. The ones who were robbing you blind! Yes, those. Everybody's robbing me, right and left. Everybody steals. Everybody steals something. Including me? Do I steal? I don't know. How would I know? He says I should have more money. Doesn't your office...? We deal with what comes in. There's more than one handles her money. There's plenty of chance, if anyone wanted to. Sis used to envy me after I married. She never did well. I always had my eye out. You use all your income, as far as I can see. Well, why not? It's mine! Well, just don't complain. If you wanted an increase in principal, you'd have to... I don't complain. I never complain! I have you, and I have her, And I have the chauffeur, And I have this place here, And I have to look pretty, And sometimes I have the nurses, though they're black. Why is that? And I have all those things... - I have the cook, I have the... - I know, I know. They all steal, every one of them. Ah, well. Sis didn't have her eye out, Not like I did. I married him. He was short, He had one eye, One was glass, A golf ball hit him there, they took it out, He had a glass one. Which eye? Oh, come on! No, I want to know. Which eye? Which eye was glass? Which eye was...? Well, I-I don't... I... Can't remember. I don't know which eye was the glass one! I... Can't... Remember. I... Can't... Remember! Now, now, now, now. I can't remember! Get your hands off me! How dare you! Sorry, sorry. Why can't I remember anything?! I think... You remember everything, I think you just can't bring it to mind all the time. Yes? Is that it? Of course! I remember eve-everything? Somewhere in there. My gracious! My gracious! I remember everything! Gracious. That must be a burden. Be nice. Isn't salvation in forgetting? Lethe, and all? - Who? - No one. Lethe. I don't know her. Well, maybe I do, I just don't have it right now. - Is that right? - That's right. I loved my husband. I bet you did. He gave me pretty things, he gave me jewelry. Them's pretty. My god, he said, you're so big, so tall, You'll cost me a fortune! I can't give you little things. And he couldn't. I liked pearls and diamonds best. No kidding! Oh, hush! I had my pearls, And I had some bracelets, And he wanted me to have another, He'd found one without telling me. He wore wide bracelets back then... Diamond ones-wide, this wide. Flat and wide, The stones in designs, Very... Uhm... Oh... What? - Very what? - Ornate! Yes! Ornate and wide. We'd been out, I'll never forget it, I'll never forget this, we'd been to a party, And we'd had champagne, And we were... What? Tipsy? A little, I suppose. And we came home and we were on the way to bed. We had our big bedroom and it had its separate dressing rooms, And, you know, its separate bathrooms, And we were... Undressing, We were getting ready for bed. I was at my table, And I'd taken off my clothes, My shoes, my dress, My underthings, And I was sitting there at my dressing table And I was... Oh, I was... Naked, I didn't have a stitch, Except I had on All my jewelry. I hadn't taken off my jewelry. How wonderful! Yes! And there I was, All naked with my pearls, My necklace, and my bracelets, My diamond bracelets... Two... No, three! Three! And in he walked, Naked as a jaybird! Oh, he was funny when he wanted to be, We were naked a lot, early on. Pretty early on. All that stopped. Where am I? In your story? What? In your story. Where are you in your story? Yes, of course. You're naked at your dresser, And he walks in, and he's naked, too. As a jaybird, yes! Oh, I shouldn't tell this! Yes! Yes, you should! - Yes! - Yes? Yes? Oh, well, Oh, there I was, And, and I was sitting there, At my dressing table, And I had my big powder puff, And I was powdering myself, And I was paying attention to that. I mean, I knew he was there, but... I wasn't paying attention. 'I have something for you, ' he said, I have something for you. And I was sitting there, And I raised my eyes And looked in the mirror and... No! I can't tell this! B/c: yes, tell us! Please tell us! And I looked and there he was, And... His peepee Was all hard, And... Hanging on it was a new bracelet. Oh, my god! And it was on his pee-pee, And he came close And it was the most Beautiful bracelet I had ever seen! It was diamonds, And it was wide, So wide and... 'I thought you might like this, ' he said. 'Oh, my goodness, it's so beautiful, ' I said. 'Do you want it?' he said. 'Yes, yes!' I said, 'oh, goodness, yes!' And he came close, And his pee-pee Touched my shoulder, He was short, and I was tall, or something. 'Do you want it?' he said, And he poked me with it, with his pee-pee, And I turned, and... He had a little pee-pee. Oh, I shouldn't say that, That's terrible to say, but I know. He had a little... You know... And there was the bracelet on it, and He moved closer, To my face, And... 'do you want it?' 'I thought you might like it.' And I said, 'no, I can't do that. You know I can't do that.' And I couldn't, I could never do that, And I said, 'no! I can't do that!' And he stood there for... Well, I don't know... And his pee-pee got... Well, it started to go soft, And the bracelet slid off, And fell into my lap. I was naked, Deep into my lap. 'Keep it!' he said. And he turned, And he walked Out of my dressing room. It's all right, It's all right. The wild one. It's all right, it's all right. Take me to bed, take me to bed. Sure. Help me. Bed... I wanna go to bed. All right now, a: We're alomost there. I wanna go to bed! Okay, Here we are. Oh-ooh. Oh, my arm! - My arm! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I wanna go to bed. Oh, oh, Oh, oh, Oh, oh! Mmmhm! Comfy? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... B: It's all right. Comfy? Yes. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm not good at... All that. You'll get there. I can't project. Well, think of it this way: If you live long enough You won't have to, you'll be there. Thanks. And since it's the far past we're supposed to recall best, If we get to the future, you'll remember Not being able to project. As I said, thanks. A-ha. What happens now? You tell me. You're the one works here. As I said, You tell me. The things we're able to do And the things we're not. What we remember doing And what we're not sure. What do I remember? I remember being tall. I remember first it making me unhappy, Being taller in my class, Taller than the boys. I remember. And it comes and goes. I think they're all robbing me. I know they are, But I can't prove it. I think I know, and then I can't Remember what I know. He never comes to see me. Yes, he does. When he has to, now and then. More than most, He's a good son. Well, I don't know about that. He brings me things, he brings me flowers, Orchids, freesia, Those big violets...? - African. - Yes. He brings me those, And he brings me chocolates, orange rind in chocolate, That dark chocolate I like, He does that. But he doesn't love me. Oh, now. He doesn't! He loves his... He loves His boys! Those... Boys he has. You don't know! He doesn't love me, And I don't know if I love him. I can't remember! He loves you. I can't remember, I can't remember what I can't remember. Isn't that something! It certainly is. There's so much, Holding on, fighting for everything, He wouldn't do it, I had to do everything, Tell him how handsome he was, Clean up his blood. Everything came on me. Sis being that way, Hiding her bottles in her night things, Where she thought I wouldn't find them When she came to stay with us for a little, Falling... Falling down the way she did. Mother coming to stay, to live with us, He said she could, Where else could she go? Did we like each other even at the end? No, not at the end, Not when she hated me. 'I'm helpless, ' she... She screamed, 'I hate you!' She stank, Her room stank, She stank, 'I hate you, ' she... She screamed at me. I think they all hated me, because I was strong, Because I had to be. Sis hated me, ma hated me, All those others, they hated me, He left home, he ran away. Because I was strong! I was tall... And I was strong! Somebody had to be! If I wasn't, then... Oh my god, is she... Is she dead? No. She's alive. - I think she's had a stroke. - Oh, my god! You better call her son. I'll call the doctor. - No change. - No? That's the way it goes. Yes? Something to look forward to. No? I don't want to talk about it, I don't want to think about it. Let me alone. It's worth thinking about, even at your age. Let me alone! It's got to be some way... Stroke, cancer or, as the lady said, Heading into a mountain with a jet. No? Or walking off a curb into a sixty-mile-an-hour wall... - Stop it! - Or... Even worse, think about this... Home alone in the evening, servants off, Him out, at the club, sitting home alone, The window jimmied, they get in, Little cat feet and all, find you, sitting there - In the upstairs sitting room... - I said, stop it! Find me sitting there in the upstairs sitting room, Going over invitations, whatever... Bills, Come up behind me, slit my throat, me thinking, Oh, my god, my throat's being slit, If that, if there's time for that. Arghhhhhhhhhh! I'm almost done. Or I hear them... You hear them turn around, See them... how many? Two? Three? Fall apart, start screaming, So they have to slit your throat! My throat. Though they may not have planned it that way. All that blood on the chinese rug. My, my. Chinese rug? Yes, beige, With rose embroidery all around the edges. We get it at auction. I wouldn't know. No, of course not, you wouldn't. You will, though, the rug, I mean. Clearly nobody slits your throat, Or mine, for that matter. Might be better. You have things to tell me, I suppose. Oh, I certainly do. But, then again, I don't know everything either, do I? I'll do a will, I'll do some paper that won't let me go on If I get like that. There aren't any... Weren't any then, I tried. You can't get your way in this world. There must be one. You have your way in everything and then you can't at the last? There must be! There must be what? A living will. Oooh! I was going to, but then I forgot, Or it slipped my mind, or something. He kept saying, make one! He has one for himself, he says. I meant to, nothing much to do about it now. Any change? No, we're... Just as we were, no change. I wonder how long this'll go on. I hope it's quick. What's her name took six years, Not a move, not a blink, Hooked up, breathed for, pissed for. Do I know her? No, after your time, so to speak. A-ha. A lot of money, a lot. The kids-haha! Fifty the youngest, the 'kids' disagreed. They wanted to see the will first, The lawyer wouldn't show it to 'em, They came down on both sides... Kill her off! Keep her going! Not pretty. Stop it! Stop it! - Grow up! - She will! She does. Well, yes, of course. And so do you. I will not become that! Oh, really? - Come off it. - I won't! What do you plan to do about it? Yes, that's interesting. - Nor will I become this. - Haha! I won't! I know I won't! That's what I mean. That thing there? - Oh! - I'll never be like that. Nobody could. I'm twenty-six, I'm a good girl. My mother was strict but fair, She still is, She loves me, She loves me and sis and she wants the very best for us. We have a nice little apartment, sis and I, And at night we go out with our beaus, And I do have my eye out, for... For what? The man of my dreams? So does sis, I guess. I don't think I've been in love, but I've been loved By a couple of them. But they weren't the right ones. They never are. Hmmmm. Mother taught us what the right one would be. We have fun with the others, Dancing, staying out late, Seeing the sun up sometimes. Things get a little involved now and again, And that's fun too, Though sis doesn't think so as much as I do. They get involved, but they never get very... Serious. I have my eye out, and we do have our jobs. We're mannequins, the fanciest shop in town! I don't want that known! Oh, stop, it was fun. We go into work and we put on these lovely frocks, And we walk elegantly around the store, Among the ladies shopping, Sometimes with their men, sometimes not, And we stop, And they touch our dresses, The silk, the fabric, And they ask us questions, And then we pass on to another group, To another section. We twirl, we... Sashay. - We do! - Oh, I know. Yes, we know, do we know. Don't look at them, don't listen to them. We wear our beautiful evening gowns, And we parade about, And we know there are people looking at us, Studying us, and we smile, and we... Well, I suppose we flirt a little With the men who are doing it, The husbands, or whatever. Flirt?! You?! Me?! Flirt?! Wheeeee! Brava! Brava! - Wheeeee! - Stop it! Stay out of my life! Oh! My dear! I remember it differently, little one. I remember more... Design. I remember a little calculation. Oh, yes, a little calculation, A little design. Don't listen to them. Design? What are they talking about? Never mind. They don't know me! - Noooooooooooo! - Remember me! Nooooooooooo! All right, dear, go on. I said, go on! She says go on! Honestly. I am a good girl! Well, yes, I suppose so. And not dumb. I'm a good girl. I know how to attract men. I'm tall, I'm striking, I know how to do it. Sis slouches and caves her front in, I stand tall, breasts out, Chin up, hands... Just so. I walk between the aisles and they know there's Somebody coming, that there's... Somebody there. But, I'm a good girl. I'm not a virgin, but I'm a good girl. The boy who took me was a good boy. Oh, yes he was. Yes? Was he? You remember. Well, it was a while ago. But you do remember. Oh! Yes, I remember him! - He was... - Sweet and handsome. No, not handsome! Beautiful. He was beautiful! - He was, yes. - Yes. He has coal black hair and violet eyes And such a smile! - Ah! - Yes! His body was... Well, it was thin, but hard. All sinew and muscle, He fenced, he told me, And he was the one with the megaphone on the crew. When I held him when we danced, there was only sinew and muscle. We dated a lot, I liked him, I didn't tell mother, but I liked him a lot. I like him, sis, I said, I really like him. Have you told mother? No, and don't you, I like him lot, but I don't know. Has he...? You know? No, I said, no, he hasn't. But then he did. We were dancing... Slowly... Late, The end of the evening, and We danced so close, All... Pressed, and... We were pressed, and I could feel that he was hard, That muscle and sinew, pressed against me while we danced. We were the same height and he looked into my eyes As we danced, slowly, And I felt the pressure up against me, And he tensed it And I felt it move against me. Whatever is that? I said. - Hmmmmmmmm. - Whatever is that? I said. I knew, but Whatever is that, I said. And he smiled, and his eyes shone, And, "it's me in love with you," he said. You have an interesting way of showing it, I said. Appropriate, he said. And I felt the muscle move again, and... Well, I knew it was time, I knew I was ready, and I knew I wanted him, Whatever that meant, that I wanted him, that I wanted it. Yes, oh, yes. Mmmmmmmmmmm. Remember, don't give it away, mother said, Don't give it away like it was nothing. They won't respect you for it and you'll get known As a loose girl. Then who will you marry? Is that what she said? I can't remember. Yes you do. They won't respect you for it and you'll get known As a loose girl. Then who will you marry? But he was pressed against me, exactly against Where he wanted to be. We were the same height, And he was so beautiful, And his eyes shone, and he smiled at me And... He moved his hips as we danced, So slowly, as we danced, and He breathed on my neck and he said, You don't want me to embarrass myself Right here on the dance floor, do you? No, no, of course not. I said, no, no, of course not. Let's go to my place, he said, And I heard myself saying, I'm not that kind of girl? I mean, as soon as I said it, I blushed: It was so stupid, so expected. Yes, you are, he said, You're that kind of girl. And I was, and my god it was wonderful. It hurt! Didn't it? Oh well, a little. You're that kind of girl, And I guess I was. We did it a lot. I know it's trite to say your first time is your best, But he was wonderful, and I know I'm only twenty six now and There've been a few others, and I imagine I'll marry, And I'll be very happy. Well... We'll talk about happy sometime. I know I'll be very happy, But will I ever not think about him? He was long and thick and knew what I wanted, What I needed, and while I... I couldn't do... You know, the thing he wanted... I just couldn't. I can't. Nope, never could. I wonder why. I tried! I wanted to do what... But I... I choked, and I... I threw up. I just... Couldn't. Don't worry about it, Don't worry about what can't be helped. And there's more than one way to skin a cat. - Why? - Hm? Why is there more than one way to skin a cat? Why not? Who needs it?! Isn't one way enough? I just want you to know that I'm a good girl, That I was... A good girl. You meet him in two years. What? Who? Your husband. We're what? Twenty-six? We'll meet him in two years. The man of my dreams? Well, a man you'll dream about. - For a long, long time. - Like the boy I was...? Well, yes, he was wonderful, But then there's life. - How long? - Hm? - How long? - Long enough. - You're... What? - Fifty-two. I marry when I'm twenty-eight, You're sixty-six when he dies. We have him a good long time. Another fourteen years. Yes, but the last six aren't much fun. That's almost forty years with one man. Well, more or less, More or less one man. No? Not much fun? Not much. How is he? Have I met him? The one-eyed man? The little one, the little one-eyed man? - Oh, now. - What? The one we meet at the party, sis and me. Sis is with him, but I see him looking over at me. Yes! Sis doesn't much care, I don't think. More or less? What is this more or less? - Hm? - I beg your pardon? I said almost forty years with one man. You said, more or less. More or less one man? Oh? Ah! Well, what are you expecting? Monogamy or something? Yes! If I care, yes! Remember monogamy? No. You can talk about monogamy, if you like, Pro and con, if you like. Leave me out of that one. Infidelity is a matter of spirit, Isn't that what they say? Aside from bad taste, Disease, confusion as to where you live, Having to lie all the time And remember the lies! God, remember the lies? Hmmmm. Well, there wasn't much, not too much. Except for the groom, eh? Oh, my! The groom. Why do I marry him? Who? The groom? The one-eyed man! I marry the one-eyed man! - Yes, you do. - Why?! Why do I marry him? Why did I marry him? Why did I? - Hmmmmmmmmm. - Tell me! Because he makes me laugh. Because he's little and he's funny looking, And a little like a penguin. Yes! Quite a bit like one. Well, especially in his bib and tucker. C: Why would I marry him If I'm going to cheat on him?! Why would you marry him if he's going to cheat on you? I don't know! Calm down, Adjust, settle in. Men cheat, Men cheat a lot. We cheat less, and we cheat because we're lonely, Men cheat because they're men. No. We cheat because we're bored, sometimes. We cheat to get back, We cheat because we don't know any better, We cheat because we're whores. We cheat for lots of reasons. Men cheat for only one! As you say, because they're men. Tell me about him! Don't you want to be surprised? No! You've seen him, or he's seen you. I don't think you've met him. He's something of what they call a playboy, At least in my time, not yours. He's rich, or his father is, And he's divorcing his second wife. She's just plain bad, the first one drank, still does. That one dies eventually, Eighty, or something... Pickled, preserved. What's he like? Well... He's short, And he has one eye, And he's a great dancer, 'cept he keeps running into things, The eye, you know, and he sings like a dream! A lovely tenor, And he's funny! God, he's funny! Oh yes, yes, he was. And he likes tall women! Yes, yes, he did! I have seen him? He tells me, I think I remember, he tells me He saw me with sis before he dated her, That I was taller, that he had, You'll forgive the joke, His 'eye' on me. Didn't he tell you that, that he had his eye on us? I can't remember. He was going with that comedienne did the splits, The eight-foot one. Well, you put a stop to that soon enough. Once you got your claws into him, you mean? Why did I like him? Is funny enough? Is having a voice, is dancing enough? Don't forget one eye. Oh, he was nice, We liked him a lot. Liked? Liked him lot. Oh, stop it! You're twenty-six years old, Which is not a tot, There is the future to look out for... And he is rich, or is going to be rich family. I don't believe this! Our father dies. I loved him. No! He doesn't! Everybody does. Except me, maybe. Except us. I love him! Well, that should be enough to keep the old heart going: Jesus, she loves me, how can I go and die on her? Is it quick? I don't remember. Not bad. Heart failure, Fluid in the lungs, Some bad breathing... Oh, god, the terror in the eyes! We did that, yes. We cried when dad died. B: I cried, sis cried, Mom went out on the porch and did it there. I don't remember. What happens to ma? She holds out, she stays on alone for almost twenty years, And then she moves in with us. How does it go? What? She becomes an enemy. She dies when she's eighty-four, Seventeen years of it, Of staying up in her room in the big house with us. The colitis, the cigarettes, The six or seven pekingese she goes through. I stopped liking her. I couldn't! She becomes an enemy. How? She... She starts to resent... Me, She starts to resent getting old, Getting... Helpless, The eyes, the spine, the mind. She starts to resent that I have, that we have so much, And that I'm being generous, We're being generous. She snaps at everything, She sides with sis, She criticizes me. She wasn't like that. - No! She couldn't be. - I don't care. Forget I told you. She never moved in, she's still alive, Up there in the country, In the same house, She's a hundred and thirty-seven now, Does her own baking, jogs three times a week... All right, all right. There's more. You want to hear it? Of course you don't. No, of course not. Anyhow, You marry him! I do! Yes, he's fun, and he's nice. - He sings... - He dances... And he's rich, or going to be... And he loves tall women! And you suddenly realize you love short men. Penguins. Alb: And it goes all right. His mother doesn't like me, doesn't like you at all, But the old man does. He certainly does! You're tall, I bet you're hot stuff. You win him over. You know, I think the old buzzard had a letch for us? Yes, I think so. And, boy did he want a grandson. Oh, that made him happy. I have children? We have one, - We have a boy. - Yes, we do. I have... A son. Well, fancy seeing you again. - Get out of my house! - Stop it! Is..Is that him? I said, get out of my house! Do be quiet. Let him alone, he's come to see me. Oh-oh! That's it, do your duty. He's... My goodness how nice! How handsome, how very... You wouldn't say that if you knew! - Shhhhhhhh. - She wouldn't! - Filthy little... - Shhhhh. Shhhhh! I don't want to think about that. He came back, He never loved me, He never loved us, but He came back. Let him alone. He's so young. Yes... Well, this is how he looked when he went away, Took his life and one bag and went off. No? You wore that coat the day you left. I thought I told you to get a hair cut! Yes, yes, he did, he wore that coat. "I'm leaving!" he said, And he took one bag. And his life. He went away from me? Why? Maybe you changed, They say you changed, I haven't noticed. - He comes back? - Awww.. He comes back to me, To me? I let him? Sure. We have a heart attack, They tell him, he comes back. Twenty plus years? That's a long enough sulk-on both sides. He didn't come back when his father died. Of course not! But he came to me. They call me up, They tell me he's coming to see me, They say he's going to call. He calls. I hear his voice and it all floods back. But, I'm formal. "Well, hello there," I say. "Hello there to you," he says. Nothing about this shouldn't have happened. Nothing about 'I've missed you, ' Not even that little lie. Sis is visiting, She's lying drunk and passed out upstairs And not even that little lie. 'I thought I'd come over.' 'yes, you do that.' He comes. We look at each other And we both... Hold in Whatever we've been holding in Since that day he went away. "You're looking well," he says. You, too, I say. And there are no apologies, no recriminations, No tears, no hugs... Dry lips on my dry cheeks, yes that. And we never discuss it? Never go into why? Never go beyond where we are? We're strangers, we're Curious about each other, We leave it at that. I'll never forgive him. No, I never do. But we play the game. We dine, he takes me places... Mother, son going to formal places. We never reminisce. Eventually he lets me talk about When he was a little boy, but He never has an opinion on that, He doesn't seem to have an opinion on much of anything That has to do with us, with me. - Never! - Or with you. Or you. Did we... Did we drive him away? - Did I change so? - He left!! He packed up his attitudes and he left!! And I never want to see him again! Go away!! Well, yes... You do, you see. You do want to see him again. Wait twenty years. Be alone! Except for her upstairs passed out on the floor, And the piano top with the photos in the silver frames, And the butler, and... You do want to see him again, But the terms are too hard. We never forgive him. We let him come, But we never forgive him. Ahh! I bet you don't know that?! Do you? How did we change? How did I change? Don't bother yourself. He never belonged! - I don't believe it! - Let it alone! No! How did I change?! What happened to me?! Oh, god. How did I change?! She wants to know how she changed. She wants to know how she turned into me. Next, she'll want to know how I turned into her. No, I'll want to know that, Maybe I'll want to know that. - Hahh! - Maybe. You want to know how I changed? I don't know. Do I? Twenty-six to fifty-two? Double it? Double your pleasure, double your fun? Try this. Try this on for size. They lie to you. You're growing up and they go out of their way To hedge, to qualify, To... To evade, To avoid, to lie. Never tell it how it is, How it's going to be, When a half-truth can be got in there. Never give the alternatives to the 'pleasing prospects, ' The 'what you have to look forward to.' God, if they did, The streets'd be littered with adolescent corpses! Maybe it's better they don't. They? They?! Parents, teachers, all the others. You lie to us! You don't tell us things change. That prince charming has the morals of a sewer rat, That you're supposed to live with that, and like it, Or give the appearance of liking it. Chasing the chambermaid into closets, The kitchen maid into the root cellar... And god knows what goes on at the stag at the club! They probably nail the whores to the billiard tables For easy access. Nobody tells you any of this!! Poor, poor you. The root cellar? Hush. No wonder one day we come back from riding, The horse all slathered, Snorting, And he takes the reins, The groom does, And he helps us dismount, the groom does, His hand touching the back of our thigh, And we notice, and he notices we notice, And we remember that we've noticed him before, Most especially bare chested that day Heaving the straw, Those arms, That butt. No wonder we smile in that way he understands so quickly, And no wonder he leads us into a further stall, Into the fucking hay, for god's sake! And down we go! And it's revenge and self-pity we're doing it for, Until we notice it turning into Pleasure for its own sake, For our own sake, And we're dripping wet And he rides us like we've seen in the pornos And we actually scream!! And then we lie there in the straw, Which probably has shit on it, Cooling down.. And he tells us he's wanted us a lot, That he likes big women, but he didn't dare, And will he get fired now? And I say, 'no, no, of course you won't!' And for a month more of it, I don't, But then I do. I do have him fired, Because it's dangerous not to, Because it's a good deal I've got with the penguin, A long-term deal in spite of the crap he pulls, And... You'd better keep your nose clean... Or polished, anyway, For the real battles, The penguin's other lady folk, The real ones, The mother who 'just doesn't like you' for no good reason Except her daughter hates you, Fears you and hates you, Envies and therefore hates you, Dumpy, stupid, whining little bitch! Just doesn't like you! Maybe in part because she senses The old man's got the letch for you. And... No girl's good enough for the penguin, Not her penguin! The first two sure weren't And this one's not going to be either. Try to keep on the good side of the whole wretched family, Stand up for your husband when he won't do it for himself. Watch out for all the intrigue. Start really worrying about your sister, Who's really stopped worrying about herself, About anything. Watch your own mother begin to change Even more than you're aware you are. And then try to raise that!! That?! Gets himself thrown out of every school he can find, Even one or two we haven't sent him to. Sense he hates you. Catch him doing it with your niece-in-law And your nephew-in-law the same week?! Start reading the letters he's getting from, How do they call it? Older friends? Telling him how to outwit you, How to survive living with his awful family, Tell him you'll brain him with the fucking crystal ashtray If he doesn't stop getting letters, Doesn't stop saying anything, Doesn't stop... Just... Doesn't stop!! And he sneers, and he says very quietly That he can have me put in jail For opening his mail. 'Not while you're a minor, ' I tell him, 'you just wait, ' I tell him, 'you just wait, ' I'll have you thrown out of this house so quick, It'll make your head spin! "You're going to fire me," he says, Quietly, smiling, "you going to fire me too?" Just like you fired him? "He's good in bed, isn't he?" "of course, you wouldn't know about bed," he says. He gets up, Stops by me, Touches my hair. "I thought I saw some straw," he says... "sorry." And he walks out of the solarium, Out of the house, out of our lives. He doesn't say good-bye to either of us. He says good-bye to mother, upstairs, He says good-bye to the pekingese, too, I imagine. He packs one bag, and he leaves! Get out of my house!! Does that tell you a little Something about change? Does that tell you what you want to know? Yes. Thank you. You want some more? No, thank you. I shouldn't think so. Yes, you do, you want more. I said, no, thank you. That doesn't cut any ice around here. How you got to her is one thing, How you got to me Is another. How do you put it, that, that thing there? I'm sorry. Well, maybe. Yeah, I've got a few doubts about that route myself. You?! Yeah, well.. I'm not so bad. There's been shit, but there've been good times, too. - Some of the best. - Of course, There are always good times, Like, um... When we broke our back. You break your back. Yeah, you sure do. - I do? - Snap! Well, not exactly. Snap! Really! I should know, it was only ten years ago, and... Riding.. Yes, jumping. We never liked jumping-hunters. Saddle horses, yes, Hunters, no. Brutes, every one of them, brutes or hysterics, But hunters it was, that day, Entertaining some damn fools. Brisk, Burned leaves in the air, Smell of burning, Just dawn, Mist on the ground, Dawn all green and yellow. We didn't like our mount, did we? - No. - No, I didn't like her, She was hysteric and a brute. When do I learn to ride? I mean really ride. It goes with the marriage. Yes, I didn't trust her, I'd ridden her earlier that fall, She was stupid and cantankerous, Shied at a moving shadow. I said to him, "you go on, I'll stay, you go on." - Yes. - But he looked so hurt. I said, "oh, all right." And off we went, Into the wood, the green, the gold, The mist knee high to a... To your knees! Stupid cow of a horse! Couldn't she see the fence in the mist? Did she come on it too fast And shy like that? Over we went! Over we went. Oh, no! Could have broken my neck, I suppose. Lucky. Well, yes, there is that. We never mounted a hunter again, did we? Nope. Damned cast weighed a ton! And you know what I thought about most? Who he's doing it with? Who's he got cornered in what corner, What hallway? Who he's poking his little dick into? That he might leave us. That he might decide to get one isn't broken. What kind of man is this?! Man-man. Manman. How was this happy time? Good times, you said? Oh, well, we proved we were human. No? Of course. We were fallible. Once you fall, Whether you get up or not, once you fall, And they see it, They know you can be pushed. Whether you're made of crockery and you smash into pieces, Or you're bronze and you clang when you topple, It makes no never mind, It's the plinth is important. To translate... - Thank you. - Thank you. To translate... You can go around fixing the world, Patching everything up, everyone And they're grateful to you, Grudgingly, but grateful, But once you fall yourself, Prove you're not quite as much better than they are Than they thought, then they'll let you go right on Doing everything for them, fixing the world et cetera, But they won't hate you quite so much, Because you're not perfect. And so everything's better. Nice and better. Doesn't that make it a good time? He doesn't leave you for something else, He's sweet and he gives you a big diamond ring, And you don't have to get back up on a hunter anymore. Doesn't that make it a happy time? Do I get to shoot the horse? I beg your pardon?! - Whoooo! - Alb: Never occurred to me! Whoo-hoo! I'll never become you, either of you. Oh, stop! And the great ring, the big diamond, You don't wear it anymore? Gone. Oh? I sold it. Oh? I've sold everything. Well, not everything... But most. Money doesn't go as far these days? Money doesn't go anywhere! I have no money. I have money, but I eat into it... Every year, Every year, it's less. We should cut back, we should... Don't talk to me about cutting back! It's all paste! It's fake! All the jewelry sitting in the vault, in the bank? It's all fake! Why is it there? Why do you... Why do we bother? Huh! Because we take it out And we wear it? Because the fake look as good as the real, Even feels the same, And why should anybody know our business? No? Appearances? Appearances. That which appears to be? I mean, who are we trying to impress? Ourselves. You'll learn. I took the big diamond in. When we bought it, when he brought it in for me, He said... This is a perfect stone, I've never seen a better one. You ever want to sell this you bring it back to me, I'll give you better than you paid for it. He patted my hand. Pat-pat. Pat-pat. And so I took it back, After he died, after the cancer and all, After all that. They looked at it, they said it was... Deeply flawed, Or it was cloudy... Or something. Sons of bitches! They offered me a third of what he paid for it, And the dollar wasn't worth half of what it had been. Didn't you sue? I mean, what can we do? We just can't... what can you do? There's nothing you can do. You go on, you... Eat into yourself. Starving people absorb their own bodies. The money's there, the investments are there, Except less each year, It absorbs itself. It's all you've planned to count on, isn't it? The extras? The big diamond day... The big diamond and most of the rest. Well, what does it matter? It's all glitter. No! It's more than that! It's tangible proof That we're valuable... that we're valued. Well, it's gone, All the glitter's gone. Yup. Bye. Are there any other surprises? Oh, yeah, lots! Oh, my dear, you just wait. She... Hides the money. Whatever she gets for the jewelry, she keeps in cash, And spends a little Whenever there isn't enough of the regular. There's a lot, she can't spend it all, Without people knowing what she's doing, I mean. She hides it, and then eventually She can't remember Where she hid it, And she can't find it... Ever! And she can't tell anybody. Is the cancer bad? When is it good? How bad? Fill me in, fill me in! Pretty terrible! Six years, I told you that, it takes him six years From when he knows it, when they tell him he has it, To when he goes. Prostate! Spreads to the bladder, Spreads to the bone, Spreads to the brain, And to the liver, of course, Everything does, the ancients knew something. It's all right at first, Except for the depression, and the fear, It's all right at first, but then the pain comes, Slowly, growing, and then... Then the day he screams in the bathroom, And I rush in, I expect to see him lying there, but... No, he's standing at the toilet, And his face is filled with horror, And he points to the bowl, and I look, And it's all pink in there, That the blood is coming with the urine now. And it's all downhill from there: The pink becomes red, And then there's blood in the bed, at night, As I'm lying with him, holding him.. And then there's... No! Why go on with it? It's terrible! And there's nothing you can do To prepare yourself! I don't like you, you deserve it! Thank you. You're welcome. I don't like you either. And so it goes. I had a premonition. I know you say there's no such thing, But I had one. It was... I died. Oh, stop it! You don't think I'm going to? You can hardly wait! Just you wait! I died, you see, And when I did it, when I died, I was all alone. No one there in the room with me, the hospital room, I was back in that awful hospital! Why didn't you take me out of there? Why did you leave me in that... don't you touch me!! There I was. And I was in a coma, In and out, in and out. Sometimes I'd wake up and wonder who I was, and where I was, Who were all those people looking at me? Sometimes I wouldn't wake up, not all the way, And I'd half try, And then I wouldn't. You brought me flowers, You brought freesia. You know I love freesia, That's why you bring them to me, Because I love them! Why do you do that?! You hate me, Why do you do that?! What do you want?! You want something. Well, you just wait. You'll get what's coming to you. In my... Premonition, I knew I was dead, And it didn't seem to matter any, And I was all alone. No one there with me and I was dead! No one! Just the chauffeur and the maid. I was there an hour, and I was dead! And then you came in, And you had your flowers, your freesia. You came into the room, And they were there, and I was dead, And you stopped at the door of the room, And you knew right away, And you stopped.. And you... Thought! I watched you... Think! And your face didn't change. Why didn't your face ever change? And there you were, and you thought, and you decided, And you walked over to the bed, And you touched my hand, And you bent down, And you kissed me On the forehead... For them! They were there and they were watching And you kissed me for them! And then you stood up, Still holding on to my hand, as if... What? You didn't know what to do with it? You held on to my hand, And my hand wasn't warm anymore, Was it? My hand Was cold, Wasn't it? Wasn't it?! And so it goes. I... Will... Not... Become... You. I will not. I... I deny you. Yes? You?! You deny me? Yes? You all deny me? Yes! You... Deny me? And I suppose you do too. Well.. Yes, of course. And, of course, you deny me. Well, that's all right. I deny you too, I deny you all. I deny... You, And I deny you, And, of course, I deny you! I'm here, And I deny you all, I deny every one of you! Is it like this? What about the happy times? The happiest moments? I haven't had them yet, have I? All done at twenty-six? I can't imagine that. I had some, of course, Some of what probably will be the happiest, Even when I get to the point I can begin to think about Looking back without feeling silly. Though god knows when that will be! Not feeling silly, If ever. Confirmation, For example, That wonderful time. The white dress mother made, Sis all jealous and excited, Jumping up and down and sulking at the same time. But even now, you see, I'm remembering, And what I'm remembering doesn't have to do with what I felt, But what I remember. They say you can't remember pain. Well, maybe you can't remember pleasure, either, In the same way, I mean, in the way You can't remember pain. Maybe all you can remember is the memory of it... Remembering, remembering it. I know my best times, what is it? Happiest? Haven't happened yet. They're to come. Aren't they? Please? And... And whatever evil comes, Whatever loss and taking away comes, Won't it all be balanced out? Please? I'm not fool, but there is a lot of happiness along the way. Isn't there?! And isn't it always ahead? Aren't I right? Aren't I? I mean, all along the way? No?...Please?! Silly, silly girl, Silly baby. The happiest time? Now, Now. Always. This must be the happiest time. Half of being adult done, The rest ahead of me. Old enough to be a little wise, Past being really dumb... No offense. None taken. Enough shit gone through to have a sense Of the shit that's ahead, But way past sitting and playing in it. This has to be the happiest time, In theory, anyway. Things nibble away, of course, Your job is to know that, too. The wood may be rotten under your feet, Your nicely spread legs, And you'll be up to your ass in sawdust and dry rot Before you know it, before you know it, Before you can say, This is the happiest time. Well, I can live with that, Die with that. I mean, these things happen, But what I like most about being where I am, And fifty is a peak, In the sense of a mountain. Fifty-two. Ha! Yes, I know, thank you. What I like most about being where I am, Is that there's a lot I don't have to go through anymore, And that doesn't mean closing down for me, at any rate. It opens up whole vistas Of... Decline, Of obsolescence, Peculiarity, But really interesting! Standing up here right on top of the middle of it, Has to be the happiest time. I mean, it's the only time you get a 360-degree view, See in all directions. Wow! What a view! You're both such children. The happiest moment... The happiest moment of all? Really? Coming to the end of it, I think, When all the waves cause the greatest woes... To subside, leaving breathing space, Time to concentrate on the greatest woe of all, That blessed one, The end of it. Going through the whole thing and coming out... Not out beyond it, of course, but, but sort of... Sort of to one side. None of that "further shore" nonsense, But to the point where you can think about yourself In the third person without being crazy. I've waked up in the morning, and I've thought, Well, now, she's waking up, And now she's going to see what works... The eyes, for example. Can she see? She can? Well, good, I suppose, So much for that. And now she's going to test all the other stuff, The joints, the... Uhm, Inside of the mouth, And now She's going to have to pee. What's she going to do? Go for the walker? Lurch from chair to chair, pillar to post? Is she going to call for somebody? Aaanyyybodyyy... The tiniest thought there might be nobody there, That she's not making a sound, That maybe she's not alive, So's anybody'd notice, that is? I can do that. I can think about myself that way, Which means, I suppose, That that's the way I'm living, Beside myself, to one side. Is that what they mean by that? I'm beside myself? No, I don't think so. I think they're talking about another kind of joy. There's a difference Between Knowing you're going to die and Knowing... You're going to die. The second is better, It moves away from the theoretical. - I'm rambling, aren't I? - A little. Well, we do that at ninety, or whatever I'm supposed to be. I mean, give a girl a break! Sometimes, when I do that, when I wake up, Start thinking about myself like that, Like I was watching, I really get the feeling that I am dead, but Going on at the same time, And I wonder if she can Talk and feel and... And then I wonder Which has died, me, or the one I think about? It's a fairly confusing business. I'm rambling. Yes, I know! I was... I was talking about... Au! Au... What?! Coming to the end of it! Yes. So. There it is. You asked after all. That's the happiest moment. When it's all done. When we stop. When we can stop.
