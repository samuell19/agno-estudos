NEW ADVENTURES OF THE ELUSIVES Look, guys! What's that? He's a White! Don't shoot at him! He'll drop the bombs! We got him! We got him! Fatigue is forgotten, the fumes sway and dart. Again hooves are thumping, like your own heart. No peace ever knowing, we live and burn hard, The chasing, the chasing, the chasing, the chasing, as hot as our blood. The chasing, the chasing, the chasing, the chasing, as hot as our blood. If you still have bullets, you must make them long. To rout the enemy and finish your song. No peace ever knowing, we live and burn hard, The chasing, the chasing, the chasing, the chasing, as hot as our blood. The chasing, the chasing, the chasing, the chasing, as hot as our blood. Dear General, I wish to let you know that I intend to see to it personally that secrecy is observed. Therefore, the region's map will be kept at my place till you resume your duties at Headquarters. I take the liberty of reminding you that this concerns our last fortified region. Chief of Army Counter-Espionage, Colonel Kudasov. The letter you've intercepted is priceless. Thank you, boys. Now we have to get that map, sons. To get it at any cost. It's no secret the atmosphere in the city is very tense. One long series of police raids. The colonel's repression is fearful. Even so we've decided that we'd better send you, as former partisans, as the elusive avengers. Remember... This is Leopold Kudasov himself, head of the counter-espionage. Know this one? - Burnash! - That's him. Today all that dregs of Russia are going South. Be on your guard, no one is to know about your mission. You will get detailed instructions from Comrade Andrei. - Andrei! - Yes? How do you intend to get to the city? With the Greeks. All right... One more thing, enter the city quietly, without firing a shot. You'll say: "Need somebody to take tickets?" He'll say: "We already have somebody." You'll say: "I'm a handy guy to have around." He'll say: "We'll see. I may use you." You got that straight? Does he run the merry-go-round? He's part owner. We bought it together. For our cause. There's a small profit in it. You think these Greeks are ferrying you free of charge? It'd be too easy that way. One more thing now... You tell the merry-go-round man to introduce you right away to a man named Serdyuk. You can't do much without him. He has contacts in the counter-espionage. Serdyuk. You won't forget? Serdyuk. - Yes, I'll remember. - Good. Andrei, a patrol boat! Maybe we can make a run for it, huh? Work up more steam! Come on! No, we'd never make it. If they don't look below, we could fool them. We're fishermen, you too. Hey you, on the felucca! Stop your motor! Pull up along side. Tie the rope. - Who's the skipper? - We're fishermen, chief. - Where are you from? - Balaklava. - It's easy to go off your course. - In this weather. - You have your permit? - Of course. - Comrade Andrei... - What's this? Ah, "Comrade", huh? Hands up, all of you! Terekhov! Go below! Let's have a look at what these Balaklava fishermen have caught. Hands up! The Evil Spirit! Shut up, man! Start walking. Go on. Call your chief. They want to see you, sir. I'm drowning! Help! What do you want, kid? Hello. Need somebody to take tickets? We already have somebody. I'm a handy guy to have around. We'll see. I may use you if you don't bare your teeth too much. My name is Mefody Kuzmich. You can call me Uncle Mefody. - And what's your name? - Danka. Daniil Shchus. Sounds important. I thought they'd send me someone looking more serious than you. I guess they couldn't. Let's not waste time. I've got to see Serdyuk as soon as possible. You will. Here's the address. Walk down to the old town. Go into the pharmacy. Ask them where the shoemaker lives. He's your Serdyuk. Always come to see me alone. You got it? Now go on! Ah, here's our pharmacist! How are you? Mister Koshkin! Any news from the front? That's Kudasov, chief of counter-espionage. Colonel Kudasov and his wife. She accompanies him to his office every day. Really? Remember! It's Leopold Kudasov himself, head of the counter-espionage. Captain, the whole street has been cut off. All right, hurry, hurry! Go on. Why did they arrest the shoemaker? Let go of him. He can walk by himself. Right, "Comrade" Serdyuk? Halt! Halt! Halt or I'll shoot! Bastard. Halt! Do you hear? Lord rest his soul! Look, it's me... Buba! Hello! Hello! I'm coming from Odessa. A little secret I will let you know. If I'm happy probably you guessing? I'll tell you: I'm not happy, no. But I'm not crying, never crying, dammit, Some other interests I'm professing. I crack my jokes, I just cannot help it, Because I'm... who? I'm coming from Odessa. A bandit recently did me a nasty turn: By my own house he stripped me naked... Pardon, Monsieur. - May I kiss your hand? - What? May I kiss you hand? Thank you! And thank you. I crack my jokes, I just cannot help it, Because I am... I'm coming from Odessa. My elder brother, he's so eccentric, Before being shot, he sang a song: "Oh, dear mother..." But there was a pogrom, and our mother's gone. And yet I crack my jokes... I just cannot help it, Because I am... - Good evening. - Ksanka! My goodness! What are you doing here? And where's Danka? Yashka? And Valerka? - They're here. Everyone's here. - Here? - Where? - In town. Ha... Your "cuckoo" call again. When I remember the things we did, I'm getting a palpitation. Danka wants to see you, on business. Business? I'm not in the market now. I'll tell you, Ksenia, it's a very dangerous place. Your "cuckoo" calls could get you in plenty of trouble. All right, where can I see Daniil? We'll find you. Just walk around downtown in the morning. All right, I will. How are you? How are you? Good morning! Oh, look who's here! It just had to happen to me, and it hurts! I'm sorry, my dear sir. I've dropped a coin. I was just looking. In case any mud got on your shoes, you can always get them shined. Good morning! Hello, there. Songster Kastorsky is here at your command. How are you, Comrade Kastorsy? Did you say "Comrade"? Please, not here... I must tell you that you've chosen not the best place for our meeting. Do you know what this house is? You don't? Well, I do. It's the office of Leopold Kudasov himself, head of the front's counter- espionage. - You've heard of him? - We came to pay him a call. But we haven't been exactly invited. We thought maybe you'd help us. - Oh, Kastorsky and his little dog! - Greetings to you! I've got a sense of humor too, you know, but I must tell you, Daniil, it's not humorous at all. If you think I'm in any way related to him, you're very wrong. This is absolutely incredible! It's simply outrageous! Do I have to come here to you every time I've got to take a look at that map? You and your infernal red tape, Colonel! We mustn't overestimate the intelligence of Red spies! I'm sorry, but you'll have to come here, General, until you have been assigned to Supreme Headquarters. For now, we'll keep the plan in my safe. I can't trust anyone. As for the Red spies, don't forget the incident with the airplane. We should always assume the worst. They know what was in that message. And what are you planning to do, Colonel? I'll just wait for those spies. They will surely come for the map. I'd rather they came here, and not to you. I can give them the reception they deserve. There's an officer, a captain who thinks himself the intellectual. He often comes to this house. As far as I know, he has two great passions in life: Playing billiards and listening to "God Save the Czar". I guess the man's a scoundrel and not as stupid as he looks. But he's our only solution, Daniil. Wide field, wide field of Russia, Under the moon, Or in winter, in snow, I'm entwined with you. In happiness and hardship, Never my heart. Will forget you, I know. Wide field of Russia, Wide field of Russia, I have traversed. So many a path... Allow me, please! You're my youth, My freedom unvanquished, All that came true, That I treasure and love. No seas, no forests. Can compare to you. You're mine, Russian field, Your wind cools my brow. You're my home, it's true, And I'll say it to you: Russian field, I'm here, I'm your little thin oar. Bravo! Anyone else care to try his hand? It's easy for you say. There's no point in playing against you. You never lose. We play for money, young man. Do you happen to have it? Of course I do, Captain. It's not funny, gentlemen. That was a nice shot! If you will excuse me for saying so, Captain, it was not very prudent of you. And he's right. Your shot. - Your shot. - Thank you. Baby doll! My pretty baby doll! Game! It's a game, Pyotr Sergeyevich! Yes. And he's just a boy... Goodbye, Captain. Thank you for the pleasure. Goodbye, gentlemen. Hope to see you soon. - I played with the captain. - Well? He's all right, but his reverse English is pretty weak. - I didn't mean that. - The ice's been broken. Tonight I'll have the orchestra play "God Save the Czar". He's especially fond of that song. - Does Buba know? - We planned the whole thing together. May I have the honor? She does not dance. Look, you bore me. Pardon me, please allow me to kiss... What? May I kiss your hand? I'm eternally grateful. Goodbye. Buba Kastorsky, a great entertainer, with his Little Sparrows. God save the Czar. Strong and powerful, Reign in the glory, In glory for us... Long live the Parliamentary Republic! - I protest! - Shut up, you dog! All power to the Constituent Assembly! Long live Baron Wrangel! Down with the monarchs! Reign for the foes to fear, Our Orthodox Czar... Rise! Hello, headquarters? Headquarters? Hello! Hello! I'm coming from Odessa. A little secret I will let you know. If I'm happy probably you're guessing? I'll tell you I'm not happy, no. But I'm not crying, never crying, dammit. Some other interests I'm professing. I crack my jokes, I just cannot help it, Because I'm coming... Not everyone here is devoted to the Czar, young man. The place is full of cadets, social revolutionaries, anarchists. Come with me, young man. But I'm not crying, never crying, dammit. Some other interests I'm professing. I crack my jokes, I just cannot help it, Because I'm coming from Odessa. So who are you, mysterious stranger? It's the second time we've met and you never stop surprising me. Let me introduce myself. I'm Captain Ovechkin, Pyotr Sergeyevich. And your name, I guess, is Count of Monte Cristo, right? - No. It's Valery Mikhailovich. - It's an honor. I apologize, I spoiled your evening. I never expected there'd be such a reaction. You shouldn't apologize for having your own convictions. There're few people left in this city who have them. Are you residing in this city? No. I was looking for my father. But he's left already. A refugee? Yes. Today I found out that my father is in Constanta. So you're all alone? Poor boy. What times we live in... Tell me, where did you live in St. Petersburg? - On Zelenina Street. - Oh, we were neighbors. For five years I was stationed with the Grenadier Guards. Maybe we even met. Though you were a small boy then, and your governess took you walking. - A Frenchman. - I beg your pardon? I had a French tutor. A fine man. First he had lived with my uncle, But when my uncle fell gravely ill, he moved into our home. To spare me excessive pain, he kept lessons light and rather plain. "His views on morals ever mellow, He seldom punished any lark..." "And walked the boy in Letny Park." Yes, we loved to walk in Letny Park. My God! I wonder whether those days will ever return? I've got acquainted with our captain. - Did he try to pump you? - A little. But I talked about Mama and Papa, where I lived, what I did. Be careful, Valerka. They don't hire idiots at that house. If you learn anything, come around. Otherwise, just lie low. The Avengers, eh? All right, we'll check on them. That boy has some scars on his back. He was whipped by one of my men. Lord keep his soul. He was a brave Cossack. Pfoo! Beating a child. And what happened to your courageous Cossack? You're joking. I don't think you should, Colonel. No, go on, Ataman. We're listening. We're all ears. It happened in the steppe near Kherson. My unit was fighting the Reds. These boys gave us some trouble... All right, Ataman. Where can we reach you? At the Kalashnikov Hotel. Why? We might need you. Thank you for your willingness to help. Here's a pass for you. Goodbye. Avengers! What do you think of all this, Pyotr Sergeyevich? We'd better check on them, Leopold Sergeyevich. Suppose they're the spies you're waiting for? Yes, but... children? Grigoriev's aide-de-camp came to say goodbye to me today, and he really looked sad. Tomorrow he will accompany the General to Dzhankoi, to the Supreme Headquarters. There goes the map... Thanks very much, Comrade Kastorsky. Why do you want to see me? Something happened? Yes, something happened. Tomorrow the map goes to Dzhankoi with the General. What are we going to do? We'll meet this afternoon at the merry-go-round. We should ask the old man for advice. You're finished, Grinya. Cuckoo! Gentlemen, I congratulate you. The Reds are in the city! No, gentlemen, I haven't made myself clear. All I meant was that they've arrested a Red agent. You're some joker, Captain. And who is he? Believe it or not, just a kid. A bootblack. So young, and already a hardened criminal. He's not talking... not yet. That's all right, he'll talk. Everybody talks to Kudasov. The Colonel knows how to make people talk. He'd set up perfect mobile HQ for his gang. They'd all drop around supposedly to have their shoes shined, but really to transmit messages under the very nose of Kudasov. And how did you find out? Very simple. An Ataman Burnash showed up. It took him two seconds to see who that bootblack really was. Bravo, gentlemen! - A very interesting ball. - Thank you. Valery, what's the matter? Nothing. It's just yourjoke, it scared me a little. I need to get some air. - Want me to go with you? - No, no, I'll go alone. If you want to see Kastorsky, he's not here. If you don't stand here like a marble statue, you can catch up with him. He just went out for a walk. - Where did he go? - How should I know? Excuse me. How are you? Good afternoon. Long time no see! If it's the shoeshine you've come to get, you've come too early. - May I accompany you? - No, no, I know the place. Don't bother, I'll come some other time. But I insist, my friend. We're going to help you. - I knew this would happen. - What would happen? You're in counter-intelligence? Don't tell me you are not. Quiet now. Please don't make any noise and don't resist. I've been waiting for this moment all my life. Come on, my friends. - Excuse me... - Let's go. Mister Kastorsky, please accept my sincere apologies for the tactless way my men acted. But even the secret police may make mistakes. In that case you'll be allowed to go home. Don't say that terrible word. - What word was that? - Mistake. There was no mistake, Colonel. I'm just the man you need. I'm afraid I don't understand. Let's show our cards. I agree. How do you want to use me? Of course, it's up to you to decide. But I've got a little proposition. I believe I'm your man. I'd like to go abroad as an agent. I'm studying Spanish and I'll go to work, for instance, in Argentina. Under the cover of a night club owner. Clever, eh? Oh, don't worry, I can play the part all right. Don't even doubt that. - You've seen me on the stage? - Of course. Listen to this. Suppose your man comes to me and says... The man says: "You need a waiter?" The answer is: "We already have waiters." The man says: "I'm a useful guy to have around." I answer in Spanish: "Buenos Aires, caramba y besame mucho." Clever, eh? At night, while dancing, I'll be giving you the information. Watch. It means "It's dangerous to come here. "Clever, right? I can keep a secret, that's for sure! I'm going to tell you a little story which will prove it to you. When I was sixteen years old, I gave lessons to earn a living. - Can you stop it, for God's sake?! - Yes, sure. Bring him in. Let me finish it. I gave lessons in geometry to a butcher's wife. Well, actually to his son. The wife came a little later on. Well, the butcher's wife was so beautiful like in a fairy tale. The woman loved me like Juliet loved Romeo. You've heard of that story? Will you please be quiet?! Do you know him? That boy? Yes, of course. Is he our man too? Mister Kastorsky's just said that he knows you. That's an absolute fact. I used to go to him to get my shoes shined. Have you known each other a long time? Friends like him we're going to throw in the Black sea! What?! Please, protect me against that scoundrel! I'm an artiste, I can't stand nervous tension. I can't have a breakdown before I go on this big mission. You know what I mean, Colonel? Take the prisoner away! How often did you go to have your shoes shined, Mister Kastorsky? It's hard to say how often. Sometimes often, sometimes not. And never in rain weather. Sit down. I ask you to release that man, Colonel. I'm sure Mister Kastorsky has nothing to do with it. You may go now, Mister Kastorsky. Here's your pass. Thank you very much. Let me just finish that story about the butcher's wife. Then you will understand that you can trust me with any mission. Some other time. I'm very busy now, believe me. - Good. I'll come back tomorrow. - Oh, no! Not tomorrow! - Ah, I've got it. - I'm going to get a secret notice. I'm from Odessa. I salute you! - Goodbye, Mister Kastorsky. - Goodbye. Why did you release that singer? He's an accomplice of theirs. I'd stake my life on it! There's a whole band of them, I told you. I found this in my house today. Tell Kudasov you were wrong about the bootblack, or you'll die. The Avengers. Very interesting. Do you suspect someone? It's not suspecting, Colonel, I'm sure of it. Not enough. Too much now. Too much. Don't you think, gentlemen, that this shoeshine boy, Serdyuk and the merry-go-round man are all links in the same chain? Got anything on the merry-go-round man? He went to the fishermen's village twice. But he's a sly one. Both times he spotted our spy. - What if we make a search on him? - That'll only make him suspicious. Gentlemen, I have a suggestion concerning that merry-go-round man. Well, let's hear it. It's simple. - Hi there, uncle. - Good afternoon. What do you want? Don't look at me like a soldier looks at a louse. I've forgotten the password. What password? What are you talking about? He told me that password, but I forgot. I'm fed up with passwords. - Just who is he? - Your boy there, Danka. What's happened to him? He's in solitary. He can't contact anybody. And they let me go. They're not holding thieves now, only political prisoners. So you were in solitary together? What are you so nervous about? They took us together to the latrines. He walked over to me and said I look like someone he can trust. What did he want you to tell me? I'm not going to tell you. He wanted you to put me in touch with what's his name... The chief, who comes right after Serdyuk. You know who it is. Am I going to meet him or not? Ksanka, go to Mefody's booth. My guess is Danka's there. So you want to see the Commissar, Comrade Filimonov? That's it! Filimonov! Remember the address. 13 Kurortnaya Street, in the attic. - Kurortnaya... - Hands up! Run, sweetheart! Come here, men! Quiet down, Miss. See that Gypsy? Cover me. The Devil! Stop the merry-go-round! Run, Ksanka! Jump! Don't shoot! I want him alive! We can't see him, Lieutenant. I guess he busted his skull. No wonder. What a drop! On your horses! Quick! Take it easy. It's only our specialist, Mister Koshkin. The pharmacist? Hello. We were getting impatient, Mister Koshkin. Greetings. Have you got it? - Ivory of the finest quality. - Will it work all right? You take me for a beginner? S'il vous plait. They're taking him out at four sharp. From the jail to the Colonel's quarters it's a 5-7 minute walk. - He'll have the usual escort. - We get you. You think the Gypsies'll do it? I think so. It'll be a real wedding parade. Today I'm going to be shooting the works. - I'm worrying about you, Valerka. - There's no other way. Tomorrow the map'll be going to Dzhankoi. The game'll be up then. And don't worry about me. They don't suspect me. The Captain's my friend. My best friend. How are you, Pyotr Sergeyevich? Oh, hello. I got a letter from my parents. So they're writing, huh? I'd like to bask in the sun across the sea, too. Or I'd go straight to heaven, however... I'm too big a sinner for that. I can't get away. - You can still leave. - Don't kid me, Valery. And yet you can still go to Constanta. You know I'd sell my soul to the devil to go there. There is no need for the devil, because there's a buyer. A gentleman who's interested in the master plan for the region. All right, what do I do? Just borrow it long enough to make a copy. You'll get the money and can go any place. But the map's kept in a safe at Kudasov's office. See, I've told you a military secret. Anyone who tells risks his life. All along I've suspected it. Yes, I suspected it! I knew you hadn't come to this city for nothing. You had it planned. Isn't that right? That's right. It's the Devil, run! It's the Devil! Valery Mikhailovich! Look at these numbers. What a tragic coincidence. Nine, one, four. In other words, nineteen fourteen: The year the war started. But there's another coincidence. It's the combination number of Kudasov's safe. The safe where the secret map is kept. - Do you understand? - Yes. No, you didn't understand anything. Gentlemen, please meet one of the so-called avengers. Quiet. What? Valery Mikhailovich? Don't be too upset, Valery Mikhailovich. Don't be too upset. Well, Valery Mikhailovich... You know the combination, but you'll take it to your grave, Mr. Avenger. Much as it hurts me, I must admit that for such activities you are still too young. You've committed too many errors. Fatal errors. What are you talking about, Pyotr Sergeyevich? I don't understand you. He doesn't get my point. First of all, you really put your foot in it with Burnash. No one except you could've written that note. I saw that right away. And then, the way you're mothering Mister Kastorsky. By the way, he's giving his farewell show tonight at the Palace. Yes, gentlemen, let's not miss it. Later in the evening, the two of you will be reunited up there... At Kudasov's. Put the cue down, Valery Mikhailovich. - You've lost that game. - I don't think so, Pyotr Sergeyevich. - You'd like to finish it? - Certainly. As you wish. Your shot. Allow me, gentlemen. Thank you very much. A cue! Don't miss, Valery Mikhailovich. I'll try not to, Captain. Hurry up now! To the counter- intelligence! Find Kastorsky and warn him he'd better leave the city. I've got to see Colonel Kudasov. It's urgent! What do you mean, pass, you idiot? The Reds are in the city! Let me in! The Reds? Hurry up, Lieutenant! The Captain has been killed in the billiard hall. It's the Reds, Colonel! Captain Ovechkin's been killed! Put the guard squad on the alert! Bring my automobile to the door! Arrest the cabaret singer Kastorsky! Madame... Surround the Palace Restaurant! Where are you? Cuckoo! Move it! Clear the square! Check all passes! - Let's go. - I'm not free. - I said, let's go! - Buba! Madame! Where are you going? Madame! Allow me to kiss your hand! Go on! Nineteen fourteen... The year the war started... The war started in... nineteen... nineteen... There he is! Halt! Halt, you dirty dog, or I'll shoot! The safe! No! Don't fire! If you don't mind, Colonel, I want to capture him personally. You can try to, but don't forget that I do want the boy alive. He's on the roof! In a red shirt, up there on the roof! Get him alive! Surround the block! Go after him! Valerka! Those eyes so dark, Those eyes so black, So passionate eyes, so beautiful eyes... Come on, faster! Valerka, the felucca! The guys... That's them! Start the motor! Quick! Jump! Here comes Buba, guys! Buba! He made it! Buba! Ksanka, it's Buba! He made it! He made it! Oh, my dears! Comrade Chief of Staff! Our mission is accomplished. The strategic map showing the enemy's strongholds has been delivered. We're ready for our next mission. Above the grim steppe. A raven would better not be flying, A raven would better not be crying, For we have no fear of dying. If again storm clouds gather. And lurid gets the sky, Call for our aid - We're not afraid to die. The End
