Geez! Hello. This is incredible. I should report this. No, you should go to jail. Father, I haven't even started. Oh, I didn't mean you, dear. Conceived without sin. "Download the latest version of Java Script?" You download Java for free to pay city taxes. A scam they should go to jail for. But this is a perversion of justice. They give you ten free minutes of Java and if you don't have time to fill out the form, which is impossible, then you have to pay up. Usurous bastards! Let's get to it. Okay... Why have you come? Me? To confess. Not even God confesses anymore. Don't tell me that, father, please. I really need to confess. Go ahead. I haven't got all morning. First of all, father, is it true that no matter what I say, it stays here, no matter what? - Honey, this isn't Twitter. What are your sins? I would say all of them. Please, be a little more specific. Do you read the papers? The crime wave in Bilbao? Well, that was me. Go on, beat it. I have things to do. No, please. I need to tell someone. I swear to God everything I'm about to say is true. - Don't blaspheme! I saw this coming. Excuse me? - Nothing, personal stuff. I have plenty of things going on too, you know. My taxes, the Java... Plenty. And coming here, listening, forgiving... It's not easy either. Start from the beginning. Okay. From the beginning. Here goes. Make yourself comfortable. CRIME WAVE Come on, please. Don't. No, no, no. No! No! You're not taking anything! You hear me? I'm taking this... and this. - No! I gave you those clubs. Right, they're mine. And I'm going to use them. But you don't play golf. - I do now. Is there a problem? And you have one month, 30 days to move out. I'm selling it. What? You can't kick your son out, he's a minor. Yes, I can, Leyre. You're starting a cupcake business, right? You don't need my money. But he'd have to change schools. And he finally made a friend. Julen. You can't do this, Cosme. - Yes, I can. Cosme... What are you fucking thinking, Leyre? That for occasional sex I'd come back to you? He's your son. No. That freak is your son. You made him all weird and retarded with all that therapy. A fucking freak. Vanesa is behind this, isn't she? Unbelievable. Your wife is a monster, just so you know. What's your fucking problem? What's your problem? Is that what they teach you at school? Is that what I'm paying for? To learn bullshit? Are you stupid or what? Maybe it's the teachers, for teaching you that fucking crap. All I wanted was a normal kid, damn it! You're a fool, fooling around all fucking day. Where did you get it? There are no fools in my family. From your mother. It's obvious, she's stupid. A total fucking lame ass. She can't even fry an egg, damn it. Goddamn fucking cell phone! I hope you explode. You shameless bastard, you're ruining my life. But Asier... Asier... Do it. No, don't. Oh, God. I'm so nervous. What do we do? I'm a minor. I might not even go to jail. You're not a murderer, you got that? We'll say that I did it and that's that. If you go to jail, what will I do? Oh, sweetie. Vanesa. Mom. - What? The scissors have your initials. So? A gift from my sister. - Exactly. They'll give you away. "LB" for Leyre Blanco, right? Geez. I can't. - Done. Turn off that thing, damn it. And clean all that up, please. It's Julen. Should I answer? If I don't, he might suspect. Hi. Hi, Asi. Are you at home? - Yeah. Can I sleep over? - Okay. Can he sleep over? Asier! No. Bye! I told you to be more talkative with him, he's your friend. You have to nurture friendship. What do we do now? One, two... three! You're still a pain in the ass, even dead. I won't let you ruin my son's life too. You wanted a stud? Look, here he is. You'll finally be proud of him. Look at how we ended up. Mom, what are you doing? Taking your dad's car somewhere far away. We'll say he never came over. You don't know how to drive. - Well, I'll learn. Come on. - Mom... What? - You need an alibi. When they do the autopsy, they'll know the time of death. If you were seen somewhere else at that time, you couldn't be the murderer. Okay, say that again. If someone else sees you a little while ago somewhere else, you can't be the murderer. That's right. I'll move the car tonight. Just don't feel bad, sweetie. I'll find myself an alibi. No problem. Geez! Hi. - Hello. Where to? - Somewhere far away. No, downtown. What's wrong...? You're looking at me a lot. - Who, me? Yeah, it happens a lot lately, I'm in a commercial. You know, the dull guy who asks for a loan with the saucy girl who won't shut up. I'm the dull guy. I'm an actor. I just drive my dad's taxi because I can't get work. You know, all the nepotism. But I can't complain, I've done a few ads. Well, two. But I'm out there. And the taxi helps me. Because I know a lot of psychology and I observe my customers to give my characters... Stop, stop! Here. Thank you. I hope I didn't bother you. I talk too much sometimes. My dad tells me not to bug the customers... So you're an actor. That's great. Would you do me a favor? Look, I want to play a joke on someone. I'll go in that diner and in ten minutes you come in and act like we're friends, okay? And the meter? Leave it running, I'll pay. Please. You know what this reminds me of? "Taxi Driver." The De Niro movie. Bob. He's a master, a god. Okay, then. Hey! What kind of friend? Improvising sounds easy but it can be hard. My lover. Is that okay? Me? Me? Come on, please! Tell me what the problem is! Hi. - Hello. A cup of decaffeinated coffee with lukewarm milk, please. No! Red tea. No, black. Oh, I'm sorry. My stomach isn't right. Can you make up your mind? - A Bloody Mary. A Bloody Mary. I'm waiting for my husband, he's late. It's strange. Are you married? It's him. He doesn't want to. Good, don't. All men are bastards. My husband who's making me wait ran off with my best friend and left me and our son. He's a complicated kid. There are some real sluts out there. Do that to me and I'll kill you. Now there's a psycho after me. Just what I needed. It's better to be alone. My love. Lie to me. Tell me you love me. You see? A psychopath. What? Stop following me! I'll call the police, you bastard! That's enough! What are you doing? Hit him or something. - It was a joke, I don't know that woman. What's going on here? Get out. But I'm a taxi driver. - Leave. Yeah. Now kill him, kill him! That's it, good. Come on, keep going. Dead,dead,dead! Yes. Hi, Leyre. Hi, Mom. What's up, Leyre? Nice shotgun, huh? Is it yours? Julen. What are you doing here? He forgot we have a project for Philo due tomorrow. Can I sleep over? Sweetie, can you come here for a second? Your dad's body is in the garage. Why did you let him come over? The project for Philo. Who is Philo? - Philosophy. Okay, fine. We'll just play it off and act normal. But I want you to please tell me how to get your dad's car out of here. After we go to bed. You're making things harder for me, like you always do. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm just very nervous. Okay, okay. I'm calmer now. At least I have an alibi. I met a perfect stranger, a taxi driver. I set it up so that everyone in a diner would notice me. You humped a taxi driver in a diner? No! Not the taxi driver. No, no. I was supposed to meet your dad downtown. I waited and he didn't show up. Then some jerk came in to bother me, I told him off in front of everyone and walked out. Then, we don't know how or why, but someone killed your dad. How does that sound? My mom says I can sleep over. And she says hi. These are tasty. Do you make them? Come on, you like her. - She's okay. Oh, Cosme, what a mess. What will I do with your car? She's just a kid! What, you like old ladies? Boys... Please, go to sleep! I fell asleep! I fell asleep! You hear me? - Yeah, don't worry about it. We're leaving now. Wow, Leyre. You get up with all your make-up! Go on, get moving. I hope your Philo project turns out well, that's what matters most. Asier, sweetie, come here. I'll take care of everything, don't worry. And especially, you know what. Okay, gentlemen. Put away your Viagra and listen to me very closely. Nothing gets people harder than screwing the IRS. You invest X in this project, write it off your taxes and we give it back to you in cash minus, obviously, a small commission. Where's Cosme? - Very good question, sir. His wife is on it right now. Any news, Vane? Let's see if I can get that car out of here. Geez, what a pain. Yes? Where is Cosme? How should I know? He's your husband now, not mine. We had an important signing. He hasn't answered since yesterday and he didn't come home. Is he with you? No, why would he be with me? He was meeting you yesterday. Who, Cosme? Yeah, but not here. He didn't show. I don't understand why you think he'd be with me, Vanesa. This is really hard to believe. Look, let me be honest with you. No! What are you doing? You can't just walk in like this! Good morning. Your husband gave us a copy of the key to come and empty out the garage. He's selling the house. What? No way. We're just doing our job. Look, call him and talk to him. Call him? No, no. I don't talk to him. There's nothing I can do, lady. Look, I'm telling you to leave, you hear me? This is my garage and I said no... Look, he said you would say no and not to listen to you. Not to listen to me? He said that? - Yeah. Who's the owner? - Well, what do we do now? Open it. - No! I said no! I forbid you! We'll be done in 5 minutes, boss. Five minutes. No, no, no. Cosme wouldn't back out. This is all very strange because... The slut. - Because we don't know where he is. Give me 5 minutes and I'll call you back. Yes? - Vanesa. Sorry, I was a little rude before. Any news about Cosme? No, I'm going to the police to report him missing right now. His cell phone is turned off and Cosme can't live without his phone, so something must have happened. Don't say that. Call me when you know something. Don't panic. Options: A, Cosme got arrested by the anti-corruption pussies. But I'm his lawyer and I'd know, so that's ruled out. B, Cosme is screwing with us. He doesn't have the balls. I was about to call you. I know what you did to your ex. I want to help you. WHO ARE YOU? Meet me at the hanging bridge at 2:00 sharp. Are you him? I don't have any money. What do you want from me? Nothing. - For God's sake, what? Nothing, nothing! Julen! Hi. - Julen. Look, I'm meeting someone here. - So am I. What a coincidence. - You. Me, what? - I'm meeting you. Asier told me everything last night. What a mess. And we moved the car. My dad's been teaching me how to drive. We didn't want to wake you up, but don't worry, we wore gloves. Don't worry? I asked Asier to let me tell you something first. Tell me something? There's more? Yeah, yeah. - God. What? - Well... Well, that... nobody... nobody has ever... loved someone like I love you. There. That hurt. - Yeah? You think? Yeah. Hey! - What? I'm sorry. He's driving me crazy, I can't take it anymore. Shut up! That's enough. She's crazy. Where did you two park the car? Well... - It was nighttime. So anywhere, great. - No, no. Mom... - What? Julen spoke from the heart. He even considered killing himself over you. But I said: "Jesus, man. At least tell her you love her." That's what the therapist says. You have to say what you feel. That's right. Nice going. Get off my back, I'm not in the mood. Coming to work with a hangover... A huge hangover, Andoni. Yeah. Look, there it is. Hi. - What's up? What happened'? We saw Jairo in a car, it had to be stolen, we stopped him and surprise. Okay, Jairo. Let's hear it. Jesus fucking Christ, Detective. This time it wasn't me, I swear on my kids! Don't shout at me, I'm on the rag. Hey, put on some gloves. - Gloves my ass. What joy! - Damn. I had to steal a car with a dead bastard inside! But it wasn't me, Detective, sir. Murdered? Cosme murdered? What do you mean? - Vanesa, let's not waste time. Did you have him killed? - Why would I, are you crazy? It's the first thing that occurred to me. Okay. Then it was the people in Madrid. Why? They're our front and we're all getting rich. It makes no sense. It had to be one of them. See what they say, I'll figure something out. Antoñito, what's up? Look, I need some info right now, no questions asked. Or should I call the IRS? You know me, I'm being very serious. Do you know who did it? A delinquent found the body in the trunk of his car, but it wasn't him. I'm sorry, but we have to ask you a few questions. Right now? His cell phone. Did he have it with him? - No. You see the heels the chicks are wearing nowadays? They have it out for us, I'm telling you. I see you know your stuff. Okay, all he had was his wallet, money, credit cards... The only thing missing is his cell phone. Detective Galarza! Let us buy you dinner. Do you like sushi? Let's all focus on what we have to say. Your dad told me to meet him in a diner, but he didn't show. Okay? And Julen was here all evening doing the Philo project. I came home, we made cupcakes and Julen spent the night. Repeat it, please. - Can we eat first? Can I stay to finish talking about us? I think I'll order something and leave you two alone. Julen. Look, I'm very grateful for what you did. You're very important to Asier and I appreciate that immensely. And the car. But sometimes when you're young and an adult appreciates you, when they think you're special... It happened to me once. With an English teacher, super handsome. I thought I had a crush on him. And it's also true that hormones eat your brain. And you more so, you're a few years older than my son. What's wrong? I came. Look, Julen. I'm going to get angry here. I dream about your legs every night. Seriously, I want you so bad my belly hurts. If you love this much, they have to love you back. That's enough! Stop! You're different from the rest. The best. Like in the movies. You're like one of Charlie's Angels. Or Lara Croft. She comes back from a super dangerous mission, then does the ironing and cooks and makes cupcakes. A super-chick. Stop, I won't listen to any more. Look at me, look at me. Listen to me. Please, love me. Come on, nobody will ever love you like this. That's enough! But why don't you love me? Jesus, I became Asier's best friend. I'm an accomplice to murder. What else to I have to do? What else? Tell me! Fine, Leyre. I'll kill myself. Fuck it. Just what I need, another death. Put that down, you wacko! Stop. Look, Julen, listen to me. I do love you. Almost like a son. No, no, no. Not like that. I wanna fuck. Asier! You see, Paqui? I told you. Your daughter doesn't want us here. Look, she greets us with a shotgun. Evelyn, what are you doing here? Since you didn't feel like answering your cell phone... We called and called I don't know how many times. Your mom's apartment is completely flooded. You should have seen it coming down the steps. Like a flash flood. Huge pain. And since the insurance guy wouldn't answer either, here we are. Hi, Eve. - Hi, kid. Grandma, nice to see you. Another. I know why you love me. Is this your new friend I heard about? Aren't you a little old to be friends with my grandson? I like him. You must be the only one. Go on, here. Thanks. Evelyn, you two can't stay. Please, not today. - Tell that to your mom. She won't listen to me. She's even calling me black now. Because she is. And also a liar. She's been telling me all day that the guy they killed is your father. Is he or not? He is. You know what? Good. One less moron. Because he was a moron. And cheap. In the latest news, businessman Cosme Insausti's body has been found... What a fucking idiot. Always doing everything half-ass. I'd bet my both hands you'll go straight to hell. For being stupid. Where's your fucking cell phone? Full of emails and messages I told you to erase 200 times or you'll get us all in trouble. But you never did, redneck. You're a redneck. a wealthy real estate promoter... How could I have married you? Critics called him "Mr. Bitter" for his... Bastard. Chubby, give the baby dinner, I'll be home early. Okay, bye, bye. Love you. You like white wine? It goes straight to my head, I prefer this stuff. This is Cosme. Back from the grave. He got the hiccups whenever he drank. One day he said: "I'll never leave you." And he kept his word. Do we know who did it? I'm sorry, but the case is sealed. So you have no fucking clue. Perfect. I see that sushi isn't your thing. Want me to fry you a couple eggs? No. Vanesa is always straightforward. I prefer beating around the bush. And this will be a private conversation with no legal validity. Shall we chat? What the hell, I like you. Are you trying to buy me? Us? Not at all. We've done some research on you. Your father is ill, you never miss a child support payment to your ex, barely any money saved and on the verge of retirement. Know how much pension you'll have left after expenses? 935 euros. Is that right? - Not much. What do you want? What do you think? To catch the culprit. What do we not want? Cosme's business dealings to be investigated. It would be great to find a culprit and close the case tight. Any ideas? Leyre Blanco. Cosme's ex-wife. A loser who feeds off other people. Her husband leaves her for her best friend, the slut. - Me, a slut? I'm being dramatic. Leyre is left with no friends, nothing. Rock bottom. Her only out? Wait for Cosme to die and her son to inherit. But Cosme is healthy. And he even goes and kicks her out of her house. What does she do? Broken heart. She kills him. I love the broken heart part. But she's the only slut here. There's one tiny detail. She's innocent. Well, not if we catch her red-handed. That's why you're here. For that tiny detail. But let's not talk about ethics. Is it ethical for a police officer like you to be in this situation? No. Were Cosme's dealings ethical? No. Come on. Be corrupt. Everyone's doing it, look at us. We're doing great. You see? Even Cosme agrees. Those newly hired in Spain will make less than people who retire. To be exact, 100 euros less. 100 euros less? - Yes, sir. In conclusion, you make more watching people work than actually working. Wow, no wonder... You're late. Ten more. And I can't come on Sunday. What do you think? Nothing to say? Where's Evelyn? Don't you remember, Mom? You fired her. Who, me? - Yes, you. Always calling her black. And who knows what else. But don't worry, she's coming tomorrow. I don't know how she can be so patient. Is it true about Cosme? How many times are you going to ask me? How awful. But I don't feel bad. One less moron out there, no small thing. Look at me. I said look at me. I killed him. Good. - Damn it, Mom! But you'll have to go to confession. You have to do things right. Would you bring me a glass of milk and some cookies? Does it bother you? Having killed my dad? Not really, actually. No, I mean me and your mom. Not really. He said she played really hard to get. - Yeah? Then that means maybe... Thanks for coming. Well, he was Asier's father... I don't know what to say, Vanesa. Did he leave his cell phone at your house? He didn't show up at the house. He didn't tell you we were selling it either? Look, Leyre. I'm his wife. And I'm going to keep managing his things. My son gets half now. Cosme's death was great for you. I know you were still fucking him for a pair of shoes. Slut! I don't think anybody suspects us. Leyre, I got dressed up for you. Leyre Blanco? Yes? Can you come with me to answer a few questions? Of course. This is my son and a friend. Can you take the subway back to school? Don't worry, your mom can handle them. Water and anything you need. Thank you. Nobody can say we aren't cool. So my ex wanted to talk to me. But my son and his friend were doing their project for Philo... Who's Philo? - Philosophy. So I asked to meet somewhere else. Where? In a diner, but he never showed up. What time? What was your relationship with your ex? One second. Do you work? Me? Yes. I take care of my son. And I'm thinking of opening a pastry business. Paid work, I mean. Your husband only gave you 800 a month in child support. Which is what those shoes cost. I know about women's shoes. Cosme was very generous. And he missed me in bed because his new wife didn't... You won't tell anyone, right? - No. How are you, ma'am? You never know where life might take you. I reported you for not paying my fare and then I saw in the papers you were the dead guy's wife. I'm very sorry, my condolences. I withdrew the charges right away. I thought: "This lady must be in shock. No wonder she forgot." - Have a seat. This man says you asked him to enter the diner at the time of the crime. The joke, remember? Me? He also says he picked you up near your home, took you downtown and you asked him to enter the diner for some sort of improvisation. That's right. - Please, tell us. Is this true or not? Ma'am, can I give you some advice? Tell the truth. The truth? It's very embarrassing. Oh, please. I spent the whole afternoon at home with my son's friend, Julen. You mean you were alone all day with that kid? First he came over for the Philo project. And then he spent the night. With me. You can ask his parents if you want. No, I mean, his parents don't know about us. Please, don't tell them. I hardly recognize you without those dark sunglasses. My dad is right, I'm clueless. I'm clueless. Let's rewind a bit. Were you with your ex or with this man that afternoon? Yes or no? Wow, the inside of a police station! This is amazing. I'm an actor and I like to notice these things in case I play a cop. Like Steven Seagal. Lousy actor, but he sure kicks ass. I see myself in a Steven Seagal movie walking into a bar full of goons saying: "Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? You got a problem?" Look, you fucking retard. Was that broad with you or not? Now you're teaching me to interrogate by force, right? Hey, what the fuck are you doing? You can't hit him. Only without leaving a mark. Let's see what Sunshine has to say. What are you doing? I'm trying to collaborate! You're starting to piss me off. What do you want me to say? - The truth. That is the truth. That woman got in my taxi, then asked me to play along with some joke. I went in and she clobbered me with her purse. I don't know, I thought it was her. But after what she said about the kid, I don't know what to think. Are you fucking with us or what? No, I'm only trying to collaborate. Was she the one with you? Yes or no? She said no. - Last chance, kid. If it's her, yes. If not, no. There. The year 1492 is one of the most important in our history. It's the year Columbus reached the new territories across the ocean, and also the year we expelled the Jews, and also the year of the conquest of Granada. 1492. In that year Isabel de Castile reigned in Spain with Ferdinand of Aragon. The Catholic Monarchs. Ferdinand spent most of his life fighting against Catalonia. And why? Julen, bring that phone here. - No, no, I'll expel myself. Well? Did you nail it? - Change of plans. Our alibi is useless. What alibi? - Listen closely. You came over to do the Philo project. That's the story. And we spent the afternoon together, which you and I do often. Doing what? - Making love, Julen. Fucking. Awesome. I can say that? - When the police ask. No need to tell the world. You mean... you love me? Please, let's not confuse things. It's an alibi. No, no. If we fuck, we fuck. Otherwise you're using me. Damn! Very pretty house. I love the arrangement. Evelyn, have you seen a cell phone with a red and white cover around? In case you find it. Or if you need help with your papers, I bet you're illegal. Julen, I can't believe you're doing this to me. You call this love? Please, call me back. That shotgun is my son-in-law's. Well, it was. He got killed, you know. Yes, ma'am. My condolences. He was a moron. Susana Salazar. Vanesa's lawyer. And Cosme's. Are you searching my house? Who, me? Well, a little bit. In case Cosme left his cell phone here. Cosme wasn't here. And you can't search my house. Actually, I came to offer you my services as a lawyer. Cosme would have loved that. Yeah, right. And Vanesa too. I don't need a lawyer. We all need a lawyer, darling. We're man's best friend for a reason. I haven't been accused of anything. Who said accuse you? No, no, no. I meant handling your son's inheritance. You manage it until he's an adult. And you and Vanesa hate each other. So you need a lawyer like rain in May. Well, no, thank you. Please. See you very soon. She was fucking her ex, the kid... What a beast. I don't believe her. I would investigate the stiffs business. Anyone who gets filthy rich in four years... You don't trust my nose anymore? Always. What's wrong? I'd never seen you smack anyone before. Does it bother you? I only have one friend, might as well look after him, right? I will not allow two armed officers to enter a public school to interrogate a minor without a court order. I'm filling a complaint with the school board, the union... - Ma'am. This isn't an interrogation. - That's why we called you before calling the prosecutor. I think if we all collaborate... Shit, Ikerne, a murder... Julen, were you at your friend Asier's on Tuesday? To do a Philo project, yes. And you slept over? - He always does. Like he's homeless. What's your relationship with Asier? - We get along. Asier is kind of a special boy. Special? He's a fucking weirdo. Ikerne, Julen is no choir boy. Held back 3 years in a row... Asier and Julen are friends and it's good for them both. I'm not convinced of that, but go on. What's your relationship with his mother? What kind of question is that? A mother. Nothing more, damn it. Jesus fucking Christ. Is it true you sleep with Asier's mother? Keep going. Let me see. The one below. Can I open that folder? - No. I will, I'm his mother. If this accusation is false, I'll sue. And if it's true, you're in deep shit. Let's see. Photos. Hey! Ma'am, are these yours? No. That bitch is in for it. "Can he sleep over, can he sleep over?" I'm suing the school, the district and the whole city. Erase all of this. Ikerne, he's just a teenager, damn it. What's wrong with you? Are you stupid? This whore is fucking your son. Get out. Come outside. Go on, I should smack you... Your nose is failing you, Andoni. The widow was too busy the day of the crime. What a piece of work. Come here. I like you, so I won't out off your balls. Maybe tomorrow. Got it? Come here. Hey, I can take legal action against this bitch, can't I? I assume. Damn, all these photos made me hungry. Let's get some lunch. - Yeah. Please, where is his cell phone? White women are so disorganized. Sure, they've got everything and they don't give a damn. Then it's: "Evelyn, where is this? Evelyn, where is that?" Geez. I'll tell you who killed Cosme. Vanesa. She's always been worse than a toothache. There's no way she'd put up with him more than you. Mom. Asier, where's your dad's cell phone? The cops interrogated Julen. Asi. You won't believe what a mess. - Julen, it's me. What did you tell the cops? - What you told me to say. What did I tell you? Wait, wait. Mom, I'm on the phone. - Look here, you little weirdo. This is his mother. What's up, Ikerne? How are we? - Hey, Leyre! We're doing fantastic! Glad to know you're giving my son a workout, sending him photos and whore panties. Don't say that. Can I have the phone, please? To hell with it. The fuck party's over. Fucking bitch! What are you doing? - No more fucking in this house. Because you say so. - Exactly, because I say so. How are we doing, Fermín? Andoni has a lot, a lot, a lot of money. Yeah, so do I. Okay, boss. Time for bed. Good night, Dad. You need help. Someone to take care of your dad. Or a retirement home. This can't go on. He could live for years and you're killing yourself. Can we change the subject? - No, we can't. Someone has to say it. You're being a schmuck. From home to work, work to home. Go out, travel somewhere, find a girlfriend... I don't know, pay a hooker. Whatever you want, but you can't stay locked up in here. Look at your wife. - Ex-wife. She's with some guy who's filthy rich, living the high life. She looks after my kids. - Like hell she does. A Filipino woman does while your wife strolls around Bilbao from fancy shop to fancier shop and from party to party. You even pay child support like a schmuck. Leave me alone. - No. How long have we been friends? I won't leave you alone. Fuck that. Stop paying child support. Put your dad in a home and live your life. - Get out. Out! You're the boss. Andoni! Hello? Susana Salazar? Detective Galarza, you can't call me... - It's okay, the line is clean. What's going on? We're arresting Leyre Blanco tomorrow for murder. Are you sure? - Yes, I am. Perfect. Good night. Okay, see you tomorrow, God willing. Bye, Eve. Bring me candy tomorrow. No. It'll rot your teeth and they'll fall out. And your mom will be mad. Coward. Get out! What are you doing? Evelyn is right there! Asier is my friend, I came to see him. - Through the window? You're stupid. Maybe, but my mom took my phone. - Do they know you're here? No. They pass out after they smoke a joint at night. Listen, then you love me? Oh, Julen. I think about your feelings, I really do. I'm even flattered. Seriously. You really think I'm a Charlie's Angel? You're a sweetheart. What are you doing? - Kissing you. Okay, Julen. Let's talk seriously. You really want to help me? - Yes. Are you sure'? Well, in that case, if the investigation gets complicated, God forbid, but if it does... we'll say you killed Cosme. Of course, that's it! You killed him because he wanted to come between us. And you couldn't take it. Yeah? Whatever you say. I'm all yours. What's wrong? I came. No, Leyre. Stop, please, stop. This can't be! No, I can do it again, look. Okay. You asked for it. Do you hear weird voices? No. Interference between your hearing aid and the cell phone. It happens a lot. It does? Lord have mercy. "All the way," they said. I don't understand anything. Probably for the best. At least I think so. That's enough! I've heard enough. It's over. Goodbye. What do you mean, goodbye? No way. You have to listen to me and be quiet. And I'm not finished, there's more. There's more? I saw this coming. God is testing me, but he's gone too far this time. Way too far. There must be a reason. Go back in there and do your job. No. Go find another priest and tell him your madness. Leave me alone. Oh, very nice. You don't believe in forgiving sins or God or anything. Some priest! Give me proof, a single piece of proof that all this is true. Gotcha. Is this proof enough? Gotcha. Well? Where were we? Oh, yeah. The next morning, after... Julen. Julen. Julen, I see where you're going. Don't even think about it. I can't go on. I can't go on. You'll kill me. I can die now. Was I good? Shit! I have to go home before my parents wake up. I can still make "The Simpsons." God, no! Julen! Hold on, wait a second. - What? Another one? - No! Remember the plan I told you last night? Yeah. What? I shouldn't have asked that of you. No, no. You're my owner. That turns me on. Don't say that, I don't want to be anyone's owner. Well, maybe for a little while. Even right in front of my nose! Look, Leyre. I might be into assemblies agreements and committees, but put your snatch on top of my son again and I drag your ass across town by the hair! - Mom, Mom... No, everybody listen up! I've had enough of these pretty boys doing anything they want. Let's go. This isn't over. - Then I'll send you to boarding school. I won't have my son with an old maid. Old maid? You should see her fuck. Spare me the details, dumbshit! How was Julen? Did he do okay? Sweetheart, we haven't spoken lately and this whole mess might be weird for you, like with Julen. But I want you to know that I'm doing all this for you. So if you feel bad about anything, don't be afraid to tell me, okay? What? You asked me about Dad's cell phone, where I left it. When Julen and I came for the car, I put Dad's cell phone in a box of wine bottles, the only one that was open. And you're telling me now? - Yeah, what's wrong? The movers took everything away! Did you hear someone screaming like they're crazy? Mom, not now. Please. Must be the hearing aid. - Evelyn. Don't tell me you can't come. Please, for your mother and mine. Come on, Grandma. Let's make breakfast. No, no, I'll kill myself. Really, I will. Evelyn, be here in ten minutes, you got that? Don't shout at me. - Want me to say it in Chinese? Thank you. - You're welcome. Hi. I was about to go to work. Give me your cell phone. You went too far yesterday. This isn't the Bronx or the Wild West. Your phone and get in. Okay, but no rough stuff. I'm being constructive. - Get in. Want the same thing to happen to you? Want me to have you beat up and left an invalid for life? But I didn't do anything, I was minding my own business and that wacko got in my taxi. Take this. You're going back to the station to say what I tell you. You're an actor, right? Yeah, but a shitty one. I'm serious about breaking your legs. If you say it was me, no one will believe you because I have no reason to leave you invalid, you got it? Repeat after me until you memorize it. Then you go to the station, say what you need to, leave and we'll never see each other again. Are you sure? I couldn't sleep all night, thinking whether I should tell the truth or not. And? The woman yesterday promised me... Money? A thousand bucks. To help her make a scene in a diner. So she would be seen. She got in my taxi in Getxo. Why didn't you tell us yesterday? Well, for a thousand bucks... But since we're talking about murder, I had second thoughts. And the cigarette butt? The cigarette butt. No, she didn't get in my taxi alone. She was with a kid who was smoking a joint. I told him: "Please throw that joint out the window, kid." And I thought he did, but this morning it was on the floor. Was it one of these? Yes. The one in front. Hi, I'm here to check some shipping fees. Talk to Paco. Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me. Hi. - Hello, ma'am. My condolences. Hard to believe, huh? I was talking to your ex and... Yes, it's horrible. Nothing to be sorry about. Look, I'm here because I think you took something of mine the other day. It fell in a box of wine that was open. It's all still there, in the storeroom. Thank God. Can I go and get it? I'm afraid you can't touch anything. - Why? The police sealed it off. The murder, I guess. Sealed it off. Can I look? Like I said, the box was open. No, none of them are open. What are we looking for? You never tell me anything. Hey, wait! Stop. You were in my garage the other day taking some old furniture and boxes of wine, remember? You didn't see an open box, did you? Since it was open, I thought you wouldn't want it. Sorry. You have it, thank God. Look, you can keep the wine, I just need to get something that was in the box. Please. Sure. - Thanks. But sweetie, he was a moron. A cheapskate. And a bastard. How can I explain to you that he ruined our lives. That cigar smells great. Where are we going? Yeah, where? To a warehouse I share with my cousin. Plenty of crap there, but don't worry. Any rats, we throw them in the pot. Mom, stay here. - Right, and miss the fun. Will you ever listen to me? Rock candy, a kilo and a half. Hey, cousin. Never mind us. What the fuck is this? Are you stupid? Can't you see we're doing business? Who is this broad? The lady is here to look for something she forgot. Hello, how are you? Sorry, I think I left something in that box of wine. It's a family heirloom. She's a widow. Get what you need and take a hike. Very nice of you. Sorry. Hi. Excuse me. Wow. Nice phone, huh? Can I have it, please? This doesn't have a microphone, does it? A microphone? Of course not. I don't know. I assure you it doesn't. - You tell me. No, it doesn't. - Answer it. Probably my son. - I'll take that, gorgeous. It's my son. - "Andoni, police." No, he's a neighbor. - A fucking cop calling you here! Shit, there's a van outside. - Mine! And people inside! Just a grandmother. - Freeze! Shit! What are you doing, fucker? - I'm taking it. Like hell you are, bitch! Help me! Help me! Help me, you fucking bitch! Help me! I saved your life, you bitch! Mrs. Blanco, this is Detective Galarza. I need you to come to the station, it's urgent. Asier! Knock 'em dead! Mrs. Blanco, this is Detective Galarza. I need you to come to the station, it's urgent. Mom... Mom, I don't know how to tell you this. You'll have to look after Asier. Take good care of him. Me? I'm turning myself in to the police. It's for the best. Cut the crap. -It's better to get this over with. I'll go to jail, serve my sentence. If I behave, maybe I'll be out in 3 years. Did you kill your husband? Good grief! Damn it, Mom. Yes. One less bastard. Julen, Asier, we want you to tell the truth. Don't be afraid. We're here to help, okay? These men are juvenile prosecutors. Okay. Okay. You say the day Asier's father was killed you went to his house for a project. What time? Around six. You called Asier from your cell at 6:20. Did I? - Yes. That means you weren't with Asier. Who were you with, Julen? A witness says they saw you get in a taxi around 5:45 with Asier's mother. Is that true? - Excuse me, a taxi? Were you with Asier's mother and father? Were you with him that afternoon? I killed my dad. - What? No, no. I killed him with a knife. With scissors. It was me. - That's a lie! It's true! - Wait a second. This interrogation can't continue. They're confessing. - No way. They have a right to legal assistance. And I want a psychological report. We're taking over the case. They're minors and there's no risk of flight. And to top it off you're late. Evelyn, I need you to take her home and spend the night with her. Well, now, asking for favors after all the shouting this morning. I'm sorry, but I need you to take care of her. Please. Where are you coming from? It looks like you came straight from hell. - Almost. Will you do it? - Because I like your son. And not me? - No. You're as mean as they come. She's right about that, Mom. Behave yourself. We're going home. You said lunch and sex with no phone and you bring me here. I even bought sexy lingerie. And? Not again. I just want to see who it is. Damn it. Hello? - Hi, it's Evelyn. Listen. You said to call you if I hear anything about the cell phone you were looking for. I just saw it. - Damn! Good job. Who has it? Frankly, Leyre, I didn't expect this from you. - Me neither. I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care. Oh, you don't care. I'm talking about Cosme's phone, you had it all along. See you tonight. I promise we'll at least have sex. I'm giving it to the police. What? Leyre, be sensible, please. Sorry but you're not very smart and you'll screw things up. They're going to arrest you. That's fine with me. Very nice. What about your son? The son of a murderer? Is that what you want? Because I can save him. This affects everyone, can't you see? What do you want me to do? A, stop being melodramatic. B, come straight here. No, wait. I'll send you a location in a little while. May I? - Susana, what's up? I'll bring her right back. Are you crazy? Leyre has Cosme's phone. Maybe she killed him and we're screwing up trying to prove it. If a judge sees that phone... If it does, we're in deep shit. We'll go to jail, darling. Do you want to stay rich? Want this business to stay profitable? - Hell, yeah. So do I. Look, Vanesa, sweetheart. We have to grab the bull by the horns. You and me. We have no choice. Are you willing? To do what? Kill her? - For example. Let's go for a ride. I don't want any trouble. - Drive. I'm not collaborating anymore. I only did what I was told. Told by who? Not again! First say this, then say that. This can't go on. I have rights, I pay my taxes. For not wearing your seat belt. I am wearing it. Now let's start over. You did what who told you to do. What did my mom say? She's not answering calls or WhatsApps. She did say something, but I can't remember what. Jesus, Grandma. You only remember what you want to. Do you know how old I am? A hundred and one? Three more. So I have a right to remember anything I want. MY SON Grandma, want to play cards? Hello? - Listen to me. I'm alone here with the boy and grandmother. What should I do? Very easy. A, don't let them leave. B, don't let them talk to anyone. Nobody. But... Look, Evelyn. You want a green card, right? Yes. You want a good job? Yes. You want money to send to your family? Yes, right? Then do what I say. Oh, my God! First in my class and I end up like this. I'd better call my husband, he's pissed off. Chubby. I'm sorry, sweetie, but I'm running late again. Yeah, I promise not too late. And don't worry, tonight we'll fuck twice. Ciao. Love you, love you. Why are we here? Because it's Cosme's property. They're building a supermarket and it's perfect for us. The phone. Nothing can happen to my son. Your son will be fine if you do as we say. Why do you have it? Did you kill him? We were right, she killed him! Very nice, Leyre. Give me the fucking phone. Do you really want your son to suffer for the rest of his life? There's only one way to save him from what you did. Copy this in your own handwriting and sign it. What is it? - Your confession. How and why you killed Cosme. When the judge finds this by your body tomorrow, case closed. The guilt was too much for you. My body? Yes, Leyre. In exchange, your son will get his inheritance. He'll be well taken care of. You have my word. He'll miss me. Yes, he will. His father's murderer. This is best for your stupid son. Do you want to be investigated? For them to find all the shit? Is that what you want? You're a great mother, Leyre. Who would have thought? You want a glass of water to take this? If you do what we ask, your son will be completely safe. So sit down and write. Swallow. I just reported you to the judge. For falsifying evidence, taking bribes and collaborating in a murder. Only you could have taken that butt from the kid's bedroom. The taxi driver told me the rest. You're no good for these things, Andoni. Say something. Punch me, I don't know. I'm sorry, Dad. I can't leave you alone. Andoni, open up! Andoni! Open up! Andoni! Open up... I'm going to handle something while she dies. Evelyn? - Yes? Listen closely and don't say you can't do what I'm asking. Oh, my God! - You can do it. You know why? A, you'll go back to your country rich. B, you'll make your family happy. And C, you'll eventually forget what you did. But what am I going to do? Go to the closet in the hallway, by the front door. There's a shotgun. Load it. - What for? To go to Asier's room and shoot him in the head. But it has to look like suicide. No, no, no. I won't do it. Of course you will. - Damn it, he's a boy and he's the only one I like. Can't I kill the grandma? Now we're getting touchy? Why did you come to Spain, Evelyn? To make money or be black? Then shoot the boy, damn it. You'll never have another chance like this. Will you let it get away? Don't hang up, I want to hear it. We were friends. Friends? That's what you think. I hated you from the moment I saw you. My whole life under your shadow. Fucking bitch. I swore some day you would pay. And that day is today. But there's no reason to hurt my son. Please. Do you really think I'll let your stupid son take what's mine? What are you doing? Shh! I can't hear! This idiot just vomited everything we gave her! Fuck it! She's killing herself today whether she likes it or not. We didn't come this far for nothing. Put down that fucking phone and help me! No, no. Violence makes me sick. You do it. No, no, no! How's it going, Evelyn? Remember, it has to look like suicide. Save the melodrama for TV. We don't like it here. The world is for the brave, Evelyn, so don't be a coward, just do it. What are you doing, Eve? Eve! Evelyn? Evelyn! One less moron. Evelyn! Evelyn! Evelyn! That bitch, now she won't answer the phone. I'll drag her all the way to Guantanamo. Evelyn! Evelyn? Evelyn! What a night they're all giving me. You're not helping me! I have enough on my plate! Hello? Susana? It's Dana, from the courthouse. They accused the cop of taking bribes from you and falsifying evidence. He shot himself. Right now they're signing the warrant to arrest Vanesa. Remember this favor. Goodbye. Whore! Now we're going to see if you and I can get out of this. ANDONI GALARZA DETECTIVE I never imagined Vanesa could kill her husband. Why did she do it? Jealousy. Cosme was going back to his ex and she couldn't let that happen. It was pathological. An alcoholic. She was going to blame Leyre for the crime. She paid off your partner. She forced Leyre to sign that confession and take barbiturates or she would kill her son. Luckily Leyre threw them up and they fought. Right. And you showed up like magic. No. I got a tip from the courthouse and figured it out. First I called Leyre's house and thank God the grandma stopped her from killing the boy. Poor thing. So I called Vanesa to try to reason with her... and I found what I found. Unbelievable. Horrible. You don't know anything about a shootout in a warehouse with five killed? Who, me? There's a crime wave and it's my fault? Detective, you don't have any whiskey, do you? I'm a little... I'm a little upset. Do I regret what I did? Well, it wasn't right. But what do you want me to say? Killing that bitch with my own hands is the best thing I've ever done. She wanted to kill my son. And the thing with Julen, well... That wasn't right either, but... You don't understand, Father. You don't know what it feels like to possess a man like that. It's... That's it, I'm finished. That's it? Not quite. What do I do now? Call the police? Hang up my robe? What do I do now? Give me absolution and penitence, right? How many murders were there? Eight? I'm sorry, but I lost count. Not to mention everything else. Good lord, you're going to end up driving me crazy. And you're done with the kid, right? I mean the retard. He's not normal. Well, Father... Right, you're not too smart either. He's a good kid. You're not in love, are you? No, I'm through falling in love. But listen to one thing, Father. Everything I did was for my son. Is that wrong? - Wrong, wrong... Well, not for helping a child, but... Then what's my penitence? If I hear about any more murders... And three Hail Marys. Is that all? And the Julen thing is over. May God protect you, queen and mother of mercy, life and sweetness and hope. May God protect you. We call you, Eve's unburied children. We sigh for you and cry in this valley of tears. Defend us, bring back your merciful eyes. And afterwards show us the Lord, blessed fruit of thy womb. Oh, merciful, Oh, pitiful... Do you think he'll be able to forget? Asier? Asier is happy. Like me. Are you happy? What? - Are you happy? Don't lie to me, I don't give a damn.
