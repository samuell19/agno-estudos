Hi, it's me, Motoko. How are you doing, Rie? I am at the Nagisa Hotel right now. The ocean is refreshing, and the red bridge makes me feel so good. The Italian tomato and spaghetti were also good. There is even a yacht harbor nearby, making my evening wonderful. I am going to dive into the ocean in a wet suit. See you, Rie! You should come too! It's free! Even for 3 days! You should stop staying in bed with Hirokawa! How's the ocean? The ocean is great even in the winter! Have you ever been here? Okay, you have to come. See you. Bye. The Mania: Pleasure Experiment Sorry. She still talks too much. Inviting her to an Oceanside Hotel won't make her shut up. Planning: Koji Chiba You are right.

Even for 3 days! You should stop staying in bed with Hirokawa! How's the ocean? - What is this? - A stun gun. - For perverts? - Yes. Ii've heard of these. You hold it like this and push it against the body. - Then you turn on the electricity. - Superb tech. My present for your chocolate. St. Valentine brought me something unexpected. Do I have to go too? What's so fun about Winter Ocean? It's every girl's romance. They say nothing is more expensive than free stuff. Hello. Welcome. I am Murakami, I was invited. Ah, Rie Murakami, Ms. Inoue's friend? Yes. I've been waiting for you. Well, is it really free? Indeed. This hotel is located at the ocean, so we don't have many visitors in winter. We invite young people now, expecting them to come again in summer. I see. I will tell everyone about this. What is Motoko's room number? Ms. Inoue left this morning. - She left? - Yes. I wanted to have fun with her. Please come again with her in summer. I see. I definitely will. Okay. Also, could you please pick a card? This will become your image card. I will serve you according to the card. Okay. Here. Okay, this completes your check-in process. Okay. Wow, it's stunning. Go ahead. Okay! I'm glad I believed Motoko. Thank you very much. Let me check out the ocean. Okay. I can be your guide soon. Before that, could you talk in front of a video camera? I want to invite your friends as well. Something similar to what Motoko sent me, right? Yes. Please don't forget to include your friends' names and addresses. - Of course! - Good. Tada! It's me, Rie! Noriko Mita in Tokyo! How are you? I am at a cold beach right now. Apparently, this ocean is very good for my body. It's therapeutic for rheumatism and chronic nerve pain. How's the air? A bit salty. The wind is the typical for this northern region and the waves are gentle. I am at a place called the Nagisa Hotel. The manager is so good at cooking! I've brought a coffee for you. Sorry. I couldn't finish it all. It's okay. Your service is incredible! Was the food good? It totally was! I even feel sorry for having this much. No, it was my pleasure. Tsuneo Hirokawa, you idiot! Where are you? It looks ominous. Rie Murakami, No. 1 in the world. I want to swim! Be quiet during the night. I told you to be quiet! I see. You don't get much exercise. I will make you sweat. Good Morning! Good Morning! Did you enjoy your stay last night? Yes, kind of. Anything wrong? I heard a weird sound from upstairs last night, but fell asleep anyway. I am very sorry about that. I guess you like playing cards. Each floor has a consistent theme corresponding to a card. In that case, the theme for the 2nd floor is Spades, which I chose, right? Correct. You run this hotel by yourself? It's not that busy during winter, so I can manage. Choosing the same card happens very rarely. Right! I got lucky. You did. Lucky! Lucky! Lucky! Of course, everyone gets lucky, no matter who chooses it. Cute! What kind of bird is it? These are lovebirds. By the way, I would like to go downtown for shopping. There aren't many buses during the off season. How long does it take to get there on foot? I guess it'll take about 15-16 minutes to get there and come back. That long? It's dangerous to walk alone in a town you don't know much about. You don't have to worry about that. I have this. Tada! What is that? This is an US-imported tool for use against perverts! Can I take a look at it? Sure, go ahead. How strong is it? Well, I don't know. I haven't met a pervert yet. Thanks. Sure. Anyway, I am leaving now. - Okay, be careful. - Bye. Enjoy your time. Your meal. No more? No! No! Here we are. Hurry! - Welcome back. - Manager! I've brought guests. They've been looking for a hotel too, so I came here with them. Sorry for the interruption. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Thank you for your service. I am leaving now. Good Night! Bye-bye! Fumiko... I wanted you to wait until my husband left... I don't want to hear it. I've already forgotten about my wife. Fumiko... Fumiko... I love you! Mr. Oda... - Manager! - Yes? How does it look? Does it look good on me? You look very cute. Happy to hear. See you later. See you. Wow, impressive! - Have you been watching? - A little. I am embarrassed. Do you play golf? I don't play at all nowadays. Do you want to try? - Okay. - Go ahead. Oh, it's sharp. Nice! It's nothing. I have only played single-player games. My skills are not that impressive. Utilize the center properly, alright? - Yes. - Like this. Ready? - It's cold. - Welcome back. Usually, we don't use the larger bath during winter... but I have it ready for you anyway. I am happy to hear that. - Can I get in right now? - Yes. - I will bring some clothes. - Okay. Help! Are you awake? What is that? It's nothing. What... Nothing but a card. I still need to collect more. The Eight of Spades. The Four of Hearts. Motoko! Rie... It hurts. It hurts... No! No... No... How is it now? You don't feel like running away anymore, do you? You will never be able to escape from this hotel without removing the tattoo. I get it! You aren't the real manager of this hotel! You must've killed the real manager! What an interesting story. You said so when you were making the tattoo! You are my very first face card. It will take some time to tattoo you. Eat! If you are too weak, I can't tattoo you. What a confusing girl. You are my very first face card, so I need more time. If you skip meals and get weak, I can't tattoo you! I want to tattoo your smooth skin. That's why I brought you here! I can't take this anymore! You are still an incomplete product. I will properly tattoo you in front of your friend. No! No! No! No! No! No! Come on! Yes! It's me, Rie! I am on a vacation right now. If you want to contact me, please leave a message. Bye-bye! It's your turn now. No! You can resist as much as you want. I will make a good tattoo anyway. Hello! Excuse me! Is anybody there? Who the fuck are you? Me? I am the manager of this hotel. He's lying! He killed the real manager! I didn't hear you. Say it one more time. How dare you! You murderer! I heard you say it! Murderer! You've become quite energetic now that your boyfriend has joined us. Hey! Fill in the color of the spades on her breast with this. - Go ahead. - Are you kidding me? Do it now! Tsuneo! Do it! What the hell! Do it! Do it! No! More! That's enough! Do you want to see your boyfriend? - Would you pick a card? - Yes. Here. Thank you. This completes your check-in process. I will guide you to your room soon. Okay. It smells, right? Not really. Stop it! Stop it! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! What are you doing? No! Stop it! No! No! No! No! No! Let me go! Stop! No! Help! Help! Help! Somebody! Stop it! What is this? Help! Help! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! No! Rie! What's going on? Rie! Rie, it's me! Rie! What's going on? What is this? Rie! Stop! No! No! Stop! Rie, stop it! Quiet! Rie... You did it! Let's unlock this and go home now! Rie! Rie? Hello. Welcome. I am Tachio Yasuda. I came here after watching a video sent to me by Noriko Mita. Yes, I've been waiting for you. Please pick a card. The End
