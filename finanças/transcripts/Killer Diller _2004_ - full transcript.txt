All we need is a little practice. Oh no! And look, here's my new guitar player. You guys got a tub here? Nothing like a good long soak. You know what I'm saying? Wesley Benfield. You have been arrested 13 times. Only five convictions. I got blamed for a lot of shit did not do. Watch your mouth. This is a house of the Lord. I will not tolerate foul language.

Taken him down the hall, let Raymond deal with him. You Know Raymond lives in a closet....is gonna mess me up Man I'm already messed up. I decide who goes where, not you. And remember a soft answer turns away wrath, But a harsh word stirs up anger. That's proverbs Yes,... it is. Make yourself comfortable. You some kind of Jesus Freak. You know, Jesus comes out a lot different when you read the Bible straight through He caused some trouble, He stirred up some things. Okay, thank you. Let's go Lonnie./ Alright.

What year is it, buddy? Maybe it's worth the money. It's 1963, 4 door hardtop. 318 cubic inch twin valves, and Torqueflite transmission. What color is it? What do you think? I have no idea. There's nothing there. Desert Beige Caramel, er, er, er, er, er, er, er. Hey buddy you miss a spot No buddy right here er, er, er, er, er, er, er. Is a clean windshield. Where is he? He got a new owl. Careful. Careful gingerly now. Very good. That's nice. Careful. Now Since we put it in that box, I think a whole...the fish always stinks from the head, Hey ain't she a beauty Ned... we're supposed to be playing a Spring Fling. Boys give me Just a moment. Keep your voice down. Keep your voice down. I signed us up over a month ago. We were playing. Spring fling is from Ballard student body. Not those convicts. They're not enrolled. Don't say convicts. It's derogatory. They're at risk youth. Oh, too bad. They're not fat, Maybe then you care. Do you have any idea how much money that nutrition center brings into this college? I'm glad mom is not alive to see this. How is it every time I bring up, excuse me. How is it every time I bring up something, it don't matter, Hey, hold on we all eat together. Where is Wesley Benfield? Ben, you are the designated driver. Um, I don't know. Mr. Seer, he just disappeared And you just left. Why wasn't I notified? But I thought I could count on you. I am disappointed. I am extremely disappointed. Hey, Mr Sears. It's, it wasn't his fault. I was walking. That is against the rules. I have to know where you are at all times. Every second of the day. Is that clear? Yes sir. It had better be. May I remind you all that you are in a halfway house, Which means you are halfway in jail already And you will be all the way in unless you straighten up. I just got word today. They might pull our funding Jail? Yes, from whence you cometh. Raymond, let me have that. Now, people, let's get serious. We have five days until spring fling This our chance to show the whole school...Wait a minute, Wait a minute, the whole school? Yes. Everyone will be there. So let's get busy. Let's practice, Let's get better... And lets us pray. Tell me how we're supposed to get up in front of the whole damn school And play this butt Numbing crap...Do you think we like it But don't come over here s starting all this trouble. You heard what the man said? We could go back to jail. What did you guys go to jail for anyway? That's none of your business. Well, I got in a fight with my boyfriend So. So I shot him. In the leg, He's fine. You know he's not dead. They said that it was attempted manslaughter. But I say asshole slaughter is more like it. So I guess you better just played a guitar and shut up. Wesley, That is not funny. Yeah, I know. It's not funny...you got to walking around here like a bunch of organ grinder Monkeys, Ooh, who you calling monkeys? Hey Man I called us all, monkeys Pipe down Wesley. Nobody flies solo here. We're a team. I can't do it. I'll do anything else. Give me another job. I'll paint the whole house.

Great job Ned...Ned the band they were terrific. Thank you. Luther Thanks,...What about using it for founders day? Well, let's not get carried away here. That's an excellent idea. Luther, the kids that come such a long way. You know, they had a whole new dimension to Ballard. Might even attract new money. Listen yo. I'm only gonna say this once, You save us man. Yeah, you did. I appreciate it., No problem. But it wasn't me. It was him. What is up man. Thanks...I'm Ben. Alright, you going to be in band... OK Hello. Hi. I'm the executive director of the Back On Track Again house. Oh Great. Do you mind if I ask you some questions? I'm doing a story for the Democrat leader. Absolutely. We need to drum up some support. Our funding is about to be cut. That band is the most exciting thing to happen to Ballard in a long time. You'll have to ask Deermont. He's the big cheese around here. Who? Ellen, I'm sure we can work something out. I'll leave you two alone. Ned why don't you Put some pants on I'm getting accustomed to these. Anyway, I started this program called Christian criminal rehabilitation Are the criminals, all Christian. Oh yes. They just don't know it yet And you have to understand the band is not just a band. I am perfecting the use of Christian music to infiltrate and heal the criminal mind. It just pauses it just blowing my focus. Oh, okay. Hey Vernon, please. You have to stop that rocking You gotta get your hands on. you just need you to be still for a minute. Hey, wait wait, wait...hey Vernon, Vernon Is he alright, i don't have Any idea what is happening? what do you want me to do. Vernon, Vernon, Vernon, Daddy... Well, he went crazy. Something going wrong. You say something about his rocking. Daddy...It's alright. It's alright...daddy... It's alright. Come on. i got some tomatoes in the house, Come on. Come Come on man. Something's wrong with him. We can't just go. Okay. I'm not going anywhere. Not going anywhere. Not going anywhere Slashed. I just calm down, I'm not about this man. What are y'all doing with him? You need to tell me or you can tell the sheriff Nothing, sir. We were just. He was down at the school helping us have plants in music. That's all How that happened You're on special ed. No. No. Wait. We're in a band. Yeah, kind of a Christian man. \I hate that crap. Go on get outta here. Actually sir, we was kind of hoping that maybe Vernon could come play music with us. There's about a dog's chance in hell of that happening. Vernon's music is for Vernon. He don't play with nobody. He played with us and he's got a gift. He ought to be out in the world. You trying to tell me how to raise my son. No Sir. Well you best not, and where the hell are his bridges. He peed them You know? I think you two done enough for Vernon. You church boys. Just get back in truck., Go back where you come from...now Yes sir Where's my Plymouth? It's right over there. Vernon. We towed it. Is Vernon. Okay? Yeah, he's okay. What did his parents say. Hmm... I only met his dad, and... And?... and we can't talk about is rocking anymore because that's why I got upset. Okay, fine. We can handle that. I've been thinking what a tremendous asset he is going to be. You were so right. He's already made such a great change. Uh, you know what? I'm gonna head upstairs because I don't feel too good. Well, take care of yourself. Good Work Benjamin. Thank you. Mr. S. I am going to have to speak with his father and get his permission. No, that's probably not good idea, Mr. let me take care of that. Okay, fine. You were handling. Wesley I told the sheriff I'm giving you another chance. I don't want any problems. You got that? Yes sir. Especially since Verdun is not a resident of BOTA house, Although he is definitely disadvantaged, in which case he'll fit right in. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. He'll fit right in. Wesley, I'm glad to see you getting back on track. I know we had our little misunderstandings, but you really came through for the band Guide me in my efforts to help the noble defenders of the word. Glorify your name. Amen. Raymond your Turn to help to Flip. I'm Serious, I think we can do with this kid. With Vernon? Look men you know you don't even know this kid already. Did you see what he did. Ben? Seriously how you guys can in your life out selling coke So now you see that, that is some to serious racial profiling, yes it is. For your information. We were real musicians, we was raised in the church. Long before we wrote them. Bad checks. If you guys are real musicians and you should be primed to play the blues. Wesley, The Blues is Wax Museum. It's not wax museum. Vernon, look at the Muscles on that, that too much. that just sick. Why the numbers on the clock and the circle. I don't know Oh, She is new Seemed like they always go in circle.

I ain't going to be ready for about a half hour Then you call me, when is done. I didn't slice it. Hey, better be some tasty pork chops. Don't let Vernon around no electricity. No Sir. I blow up some things. So Vernon, I was kind of hoping maybe later you can come by and maybe we can do some planning, you know, With your permission. Of course. I play guitar. Whereabouts do you live exactly, Down over on ninth street. Over by the Christian college. You live in that halfway house? Yup. Near Yeah I do Sir. It's really more like a dorm.

Oh, Jackass Hi, Mr. Jackson, I'm Dr. Gwen Bradley What have you done to Vernon . He don't even recognize me. His medication is still wearing off. He arrived in a highly agitated state. No one could control him I can control him. He can't be around people. We tried calling you. The deputy even went out to your house. Well, I was out looking for Vernon. All night?... Yeah. Well, I had to pull over and sleep some. Has Vernon been tested,the BSC or the aberrant behavior checklist. Maybe in school. Mr. Jackson. I would like to test Vernon. I suspect that he has a high functioning degree of autism. Vernon needs to learn how to interact. He needs to learn how to read social cues. Takes time and patience, but it can be done. And Mr. Jackson, I think that keeping him at home is not the answer. Yeah, man, i tell you what, it sure was fun, greatest night of my life Well I hope it was worth it. This house is closing.
