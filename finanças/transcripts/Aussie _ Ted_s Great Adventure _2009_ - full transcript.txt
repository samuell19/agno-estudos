Her name's Mei Mei. This whole story begins on the day she came to visit our house. That there's my dad. He's always clacking away on that old machine of his. He says it's more organic than a computer, whatever that means. Now, you see that box Mei Mei's carrying? I knew what was inside. What I didn't know was that it would end up changing my whole life around. - One second, coming. Mei Mei, hi, how are you? Come on inside. - Thank you, Michael. I would like to stay and visit, but I need to get back to the store. I just wanted to make sure you got this today. - Wow, this--incredible, so very kind of you. Thank you. I don't even know what to say. - This gift will bring your family much light. - I'm sure it will, and Laney will love it. Bye-bye.

So what's wrong? Well, I finally heard from silverman. Um, they're not looking at any new projects. They won't even read my synopsis. Apparently, the middle-grade book market is saturated...

We can't afford to buy this place right now. - Yeah, tell me about it. My stress level's off the charts right now. I mean, why do you think I'm meditating? Ooohhhmmmm. Oh, i-- I have a showing this afternoon. Can you pick the kids up from school? - Sure, no problem. I've got nothing to do anyway. The middle-grade book market is saturated. - Ooohhmmm.

Catch you later, mates. Still talkin' to that smelly mutt? - He's not a smelly mutt. He's a brave dog on a mission to make a little human girl happy. - Oh, yeah? - Yes, he'll find that Teddy bear. He's a hero. - Right, if he's such a hero, how come he was the one who took that bear away from his human in the first place? - Ugh, puh-leez. Rufus, you don't even have enough brains to give yourself a headache. - Ask him yourself. That hero took the bear away from his poor, defenseless human girl. Told me that himself. Doesn't seem so brave and heroic now, does he? - I don't believe you. Aussie is a loving dog, which is more than I can say for you. Hmmph! - I think that went well for you, Rufus. She obviously has a crush on you... Not. - I'm gonna crush you, recess. What did you talk about with that mutt? - I'm not telling. - Don't push me, recess, or I'm gonna make soup out of you. - You can't catch me. You can't even climb a tree. - You're crossing the line, recess. I want you to know that. You're crossing the line. - What do you think I am, a scaredy-cat? - Yeah, whatever. I don't need your help. I'll just follow that little mutt's stench. No way am I gonna let him be the hero in cricket's eyes. - Dogs: You can't live with them, and...period. Bridge, bridge, bridge. I think it's this way. Oh, yeah, I knew it. There it is, bingo. Excuse me. Pardon me, ooh. ♪ - Oh, man, it stinks. I must be headed in the right direction. - I wonder if this was the place recess was talking about. ♪ I'm picking up something. I'm sure he's around here. Don't let me down, nose. Ted, I feel you. Where are you? - Rufus. - Hiya, runt. Say bye-bye to the Teddy bear, 'cause you're never gonna see him again. - Why are you so mean, Rufus? What did I ever do to you? - One word: Cricket. She seems to think you're some kind of hero. If you bring the bear back, the deal's sealed. She'll never look at me again with those big, brown, beautiful eyes. - I'm not doing this to impress cricket. I'm doing it because I love my human. - Yeah? Well, you shouldn't have taken the bear from your human in the first place. Now you'll never get it back. - Hey. Oh, no. What am I going to do now? ♪ - A parade, perfect. I'll just run through here. That mutt's sense of smell will be totally confused. ♪ - Whoa, what do we have here? All these people, the food... My nose is all mixed up. I feel dizzy. ♪ A dragon. Eric has one of those. I didn't know they came in jumbo size, crikey. It's this way, I think. Well, what have I got to lose? - Hey, there, what's the matter? What's gotten into you, girl? Cricket... What is it? - There you are, finally. Boy, am I glad to see you, aussie. Where have you been? - I lost the Teddy bear again, cricket. - I know, i-- - Rufus took it away from me. He said I'll never see it again. The mission is a complete failure. - I know, but-- - I was so close to bringing him home to her, so close. - I know. - I almost--hey, how come you know so much? - I saw Rufus with the Teddy bear in his mouth. - You did? Where, cricket? Tell me where. - Follow me. I'll show you. - Looks like nobody lives here anymore. Perfect. Hasta la vista, Teddy. Whoa! Oops, did I do that? - Come on, he went this way. I saw him run down this street, but I don't know where he went after that. - Right, let's sniff the area. - Wait...just a minute. Aussie, is it true that you were the one that took that bear from your human? - Rufus told you that, didn't he? Yeah, I reckon it's true. - How could you? - Wait, let me explain. I was just...So jealous. My human loves that bear. I thought maybe she loved him more than me, so yeah, I hid him in the yard, but then I felt bad about it. I don't want my human to be sad. - We are dogs, aussie. We should always be proud of the fact that we love our humans unconditionally. - Unconditionally? - It means we love them no matter what. I'm disappointed in you, aussie. - I'm disappointed in me too. Hey, what's going on? Sirens? - All right, come on, guys, you're gonna have to move back. It's not safe here. - Hey, wait a minute. I can feel you, Ted. You're in there, aren't you? - Okay, are we ready? - All right, we're speeded. - Great. - And...go. - Thankfully, nobody lives in this house. Neighbors say it's been vacant for years. - Are you crazy? Don't even think about it. - I'm ready to do what's right, aussie. - Out of my way, bubble brains. I got to get in there. - That's a dog there. - Did you see that dog run in? - Get a move, buddy. All: Whoa. - Hey, the dog's coming out, look, look. - Oh, here comes the dog. - Hey, the dog. - Whoa, did you see that dog? Are you getting this? We're here at the scene of a local house fire that broke out earlier today. Now, as we were reporting on the fire, we caught these images of a dog running into... - That's the dog who visited our store. - Not just any dog, a very special dog. They are taking care of each other now, and hopefully, they will find their way to the farm, and they will reunite with the family. - Mei Mei? - It feels so good to reunite with the family. - Oh, Mei Mei. - Ted, look, we're finally home. Oh, no. What's happened? They're gone. I smell Laney. There's a picture. It looks like animals, 'but I'm not sure what kind. Now what am I gonna do? - She misses us. Don't you feel that? - All I feel is sad. Everybody's gone. I don't have a family anymore. You'd better stay here, Ted. I'm sure someone will find you and give you a home. - Don't leave me here, aussie. I'm home with you. - I don't have a home now. - Then take me to the place where I came from: To Mei Mei. - You mean that weird store with all the statues and stuff? I know where that is. All right, I can take you there. ♪ Huh? Oh, no, it's Rufus. I can't let him get you again. - Hello, Rufus. - I saw what you did, aussie. - You saw? So what? - I saw you jump into that fire to save the bear. That was brave of you, stupid but brave. So where's the bear? - Not here, not with me. - Let's see. What is this I smell? - Just give him the bear, aussie. Trust me. Save your own tail. - It's awfully familiar. - No, think fast. There must be a solution. - Any ideas? I need one urgent. - What could it be? - I've got it. Remember that time you ate that leftover chili, and then the whole family left the room screaming? - Yeah, so? - Do what you did then. It might work. - Oh, well, why not? I have nothing to lose. - Okay, here I go. - Oh, pew. What did they feed you, man? Garbage? Gross. Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck. - Oh, I remember you, the dog and the bear. Hello, there. - Hi, do you know where Mei Mei is? - Oh, Mei Mei's not here anymore. She fell asleep, the kind where she will never wake up again. - Oh, no. You mean...She died? That's so sad. - She wouldn't want us to be sad. She is at peace now. - Before she fell asleep, Mei Mei talked about you. She said that you will find your way back to the farm, and then you will be home. - Farm? The only farm I know is the one that belongs to aunt Zelda, but I don't know how to get there. It's really far away. - When you love somebody, there is no such thing as distance. Let's go home, aussie. - All right, then. Let's go home. Thanks, and sorry about Mei Mei. - Good luck. - We drove around for over two hours, and I talked to all the neighbors. Nobody's seen him. - And we put up some more signs too, mom. - Well, I still feel like we're going to find them, guys. - Me too. - Me three. - Me four. - Bye, mommy. I love you. - Bye-bye, - bye, love you. - I can't find anything in here. - And there's rain in the forecast. These and other stories... - It sure does feel different in this house without aunt Zelda around. - Hey, dad, can I be in charge of the goats? - I want to be in charge of the goats. - You can both be in charge of the goats. - Works for me. - Rescuer who braved the flames to bring out a loved one... - Honey, honey, come here. Quick, take look at this. - Henry, we're here at the scene of a local house fire that broke out earlier today. Now, as we were reporting on that fire, we caught these images of a dog running into the burning building. He came out a minute later carrying a Teddy bear in his mouth. Apparently, this brave little dog really loves his bear. At this hour, the identity of the dog remains a mystery. - In other news, the city council took... - What? What did I do? ♪ - It's getting mighty cold. Ain't a fit night out for beast or bear. Reckon we better find someplace to tuck in for the night. Oh, look at that poor man. He seems like he needs a friend. - We could use a friend too, couldn't we, mate? - Well, what have we got here? Oh, good dog. Mmm. - Hey, Ted, you think he lives here? - I'm afraid so, aussie. - Mm-hmm, yeah, okay, I understand. Hey, thank you very much for taking my call. Okay, bye-bye. - Well, the fire station has no idea where aussie is. They say he just ran off, but he didn't seem hurt. He was just fine, okay? And Ted seemed like he was just fine too, sweetheart. - He rescued Ted. Pretty smart thing for him to do, huh, Eric? Aussie's a genius. - Whatever. I told you it wasn't my fault. - Well, all we can do is hope that somebody recognizes him. - Wait, or maybe the bear will send a telepathic message to Laney. - Mmm. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay, the important thing is that right now, aussie will be a lot easier to find because he's a TV star, okay? ♪ - Whoa, crazy dream. I slept pretty deep thanks to this nice man. He kept us warm all night. - I hope someone can find him a home someday. - Well, mate, we've got a home of our own to go find. Come on, Ted, let's get going.

I've got to find that dog. He's a hero. - What are you gonna do? - You know, I wonder if he's a stray. - Maybe the station should put up a reward. - Yeah, make some phone calls. I think the reward's a fantastic idea. Thanks, Nina. - Toodles. - This one's name is Fargo, and this one's tubby, and this one's Lola, tubby's sister. - Oh, they're just lovely. - We like it here, mom. - Yeah, it doesn't smell too bad. Ehhh, I'll get used to it, I suppose. - Guys, you are not gonna believe this. - They found aussie? - No, no, honey, not yet, but my publisher just called. Somebody over there read my novel. They passed it to the editor. They love it; They want me to do the whole series. - Oh, that's wonderful, honey. - I've already got my first deadline, so I'll be writing nonstop for the next three months. - That's so cool, dad. - Thank you. - Hey, who's gonna be in charge of the animals? - Uhhhhh. - Oh, mom! - Honey, are you okay? - Ewww. - Oh, that's nasty. - I smell horses. This way. - That's right, Henry, a couple of days ago, we aired a story about an adorable little dog who saved a Teddy bear from a burning house. Well, we did some investigative reporting and tracked down the owners of that dog. They told us his name is aussie and that's he's been missing for several days. Channel one is now offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the safe return of aussie. - Maybe that horse will know something. G'day, mate. Lovely day, isn't it? - Hmph. - So I'm looking for my human family. I think they're visiting a farm around here somewhere. I have a mom and a dad and a sister and a brother. - Mm, I heard those pigeons over there talking about a new human family. - They just moved to a farm across the old wooden bridge. - Word out in the field is, the mother's a bit cuckoo. - Likes to swim in the mud with the pigs. - Hm, can't be my family. My mom doesn't like mud or pigs, and I seriously doubt she can swim. Thanks, anyway. - Mm-hmm. - Yep, yep, yep. - Yep, yep. Well, I'll be. Gary, Gary, I got to talk to you. Are you there? Gary, you know that dog they're looking for on TV, the one with the reward? - I don't think he wants to help us, Ted. - Trust your heart, aussie, and fast. - It's standing right in front of me. Dagnabbit, it's getting away. I'm going after him. ♪ All right, Gary, listen up. I need you to block off the east side of the barn. Gary? Gary, are you there? Aw, Gary, are you getting any of this? I'm closing in on him. Can you hear me now? Once we round him up, we'll just sit on him awhile until they raise the reward, kind of like having a little doggie hostage. - Why is he chasing us? What did we ever do to him? Whoa, whoa! Ugh! - Mortimer, you was lookin' for me? I was in the outhouse. Mortimer? - Daddy's writing a lot. - Yep, and it makes him very happy. - I know the secret to happiness. - You do? - If I want to be happy, i just close my eyes and make pictures in my mind, pictures of everything I wish for. - That's beautiful, sweetie, and it's true too. - I know it is. Ted told me that. - Ted, your bear? Well, if Ted said it, then it must be true. Does that mean I can close my eyes and picture a poo-free farm? You're just kidding, right? You do like it here, don't you, mommy? - Actually, it is starting to grow on me, believe it or not. I can barely even smell the animals anymore. Good night, Laney. - Good night. ♪ - Oh, man, i could go for a big bowl of kibble right now. - I sense something. - Please tell me it's breakfast. I'm starving. - Go to where the sun comes from. - You mean that way? Might as well. You've been right about everything so far. - Mom, mom, time to wake up. We need to take care of the animals, remember? - Where's your father? - He's been writing since the sun came up. Come on. - I hear you. I'm coming. I'm up. Ugh. - Eric, look, an egg. - Oh, cool. Oh, that's so cool. - I smell something. We're on the right track. - In 200 yards, turn left. - We're close.

He is glowing. - He's happy. He's finally home. - I'll never doubt you again, Laney. Well, maybe just a little. - Yeah, whoo! - When I saw aussie... - Yeah, mates, that's our story, fair dinkum. Ted and I became very famous. We're staying on the farm for good. Aunt Zelda fell in love with a man in South Africa, so she decided to sell the farm to my mom and dad. My family is really happy. They love it here. I do too, and so does Ted. Hello, hello, hello, my beautiful pomeranian Princess. - So, aussie, you're a country dog now, and I'm a city dog. How would you feel about a long-distance relationship? - Oh, cricket, when you love somebody, there's no such thing as distance. Mmmuah! - That's it. Aussie lost his head, and we lost aussie. He's totally in love. - Love is for the birds. - I guess we can go on vacation now. - So where to?
