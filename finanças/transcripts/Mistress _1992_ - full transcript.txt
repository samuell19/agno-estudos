It's called days gone by. Days gone by? We made that years ago. You're kidding. No, I'm not. It was called flesh tone. Oh, yeah. It was a terrific film. Thank you. Ah, let's see what we got here. O.k. I understand that. I'm trying to get a hold of him. Doesn't he have an agent? Agent? No. Well, how the hell do you contact him? Well, we don't contact him. It's a cult. We're not allowed to contact up there. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm sorry. It's all right. Hello. Hello? Is this Marvin landisman? Yes. Marvin, this is Jack roth. Uh-huh. You know, Marvin, strange things happen in this business. Maybe that's why I love it so much. I was cleaning out my files last night, and I came across a script of yours. I reread it, and I liked it. I really liked it. Marvin? What script? It's called the darkness and the light. I haven't given out that script in years. Well, you know what? It's more timely than ever. Um, would you hold on a second, please? Sure. I'm sorry, who are you again? Jack roth. Didn't I meet you at the commissary at universal? Oh, yeah. Marvin, your script's a knockout. In fact, I think I know where we can get it made. You interested? Look, I wrote... I wrote that script for me to direct, so... Sure. Sure. All the better. What say we get together tomorrow and talk about it. How about lunch? O.k. Would you mind meeting me at Shelby's? I know it's not the greatest food, but it's convenient. Which one? The one on 3rd. How about 1:00? And now we light a match... And presto. Hold it. Hold it. What's wrong? This is no good. What isn't? You can see here. It didn't poof. It's supposed to poof with a big flame. O.k., put some more Brandy on it. No, there's... ooh, there's plenty of Brandy on this one. I got to be out of here by 12:30. What about lighter fluid? Lighter fluid will ruin the pan. O.k. O.K. Hans, all right. O.k. I've had it. Marvin? Jack. It's wonderful to see you. You haven't changed a bit. You look great. Come on. I got a table in the back. Normally I like to meet somewhere else, but since I was at Paramount, I figured what the hell. The food's not half bad. There's somebody here I'd like you to meet. This is Stuart stratland, a very talented young writer. Nice to meet you, Marvin. If you don't mind, I figured Stuart would sit in. No, that's o.K. Sure. Good. So, come on, guys. What are you going to have? Marvin, order something good. The steak sandwich isn't bad. Honey, what's good? These men are very hungry. Same old thing. The Turkey's on special. Is that good? Do you like Turkey? Turkey's all right. Fine. I'll have the Turkey sandwich. I'll have a bacon cheeseburger, onion rings, and a large coke. I'll have the... I had a late breakfast. I'll just have a salad. They put a lot of shrimp on it? Yeah. Tell the chef to really heap the shrimp on. O.k. Thanks. So... I remember at universal there was a lot of good talk about that picture of yours. Too bad about what happened. Yeah, well, that was a long time ago. So, have you done any directing since? Uh, lately I've been working in video. Mtv? No, uh, instructional cassettes for the home market. Oh. Uh-huh. You know, that script of yours has all the right elements, I mean... It's got good characters and a terrific story. I don't know if you agree with me, but story is the most important script element. Well, yeah, I do agree. Story is very important. You know, I liked it so much, I reread it last night after we talked. It was a real pleasure. It's got great parts for actors. It's...it's modern, it's timely. What the hell more could you ask for? Thanks. I worked hard to get the right balance. That's a good way to put it, Marvin. It is balanced. You may not agree, but it does get heavy in places. Well, the painter kills himself. That's what I mean. The whole thing is very heavy. Well, suicide is a dark subject. Depends on how it's handled. Stuart here's very talented. He wrote a terrific science fiction thing. The backer I've got wants to do a smaller film, something more artistic. I'm not sure they'll go for a script about suicide. It's not about suicide. It's about an artist's courage. He's driven to kill himself. I won't change that. Naturally. I'm not asking you to change that. It's an important element. I find it very moving, but maybe it could be handled a little differently. Does he have to kill himself? Couldn't he just leave town at the end? The whole point is that he's destroyed by society. No, he can't just leave. What if he was killed in an accident? Stuart had the same teachers as Spielberg at Cal state. Marvin, you're in the driver's seat, but Stuart has some very, very interesting ideas. I figured that you guys could, you know, sit down, you know, look at it. I could have made this film years ago if I wanted to play footsie-wootsie. Marvin, we're just talking here. I knew it. I'm not changing one word! I don't need to make this film, and I don't need your sandwich. Let's...let's just forget it, o.K.? Jesus, I love your passion. It's so refreshing. I was at universal years ago when Nick ray threw a projector out of a window. This is what a good director has to have, Stuart. I'm just here to be used. Cheeseburger... Oh, that's uh... Turkey... And shrimp... And the ketchup, and I'll bring your coke. Maybe I am a little too apprehensive, but it's because I want to get this picture made, Marvin. Maybe I'm being too cautious. Why don't you meet my money guy? My gut tells me he'll like you. He's going to finance the film? Very interesting guy. He's a real player, and he's got this girl. I think she's terrific. She really has something. She's cute as a button, but decide for yourself. Decide what? He wants her in the movie. I have to give her a role? A role? Depends on what you mean by a role. He wants a little something to get her career going. Problem? Yeah. This thing with the girlfriend... Marvin, I need to make a good picture. If she isn't right for the part, I won't let you cast her. Hello. Marvin? Oh, hi. Rachel. Yeah. Your wife. Remember? Didn't sound like you. You're so up. I was just eating a sandwich. I'm in the subway, so we'll talk fast. I'm going to the lawyers to clinch this deal before Mr. Momolio changes his mind. You pulled it off? I pulled it off. He'll lease US the restaurant space incredibly cheap, and he's coming in as a partner. So it's happening. Marvin, the train's coming. There's a position opening in the drama department at queens college. They're very interested in you. I hear they have a beautiful theater there. We'll have a great time in New York. Here's my train. Bye. I love you. I love you, too, honey. Hey, congratulations. Darn it. I don't see the soup. There's too much kasha. Did they put in any soup? It's in there if you look. You're lucky you got served. Same old place. Been here forever. Forever. I know it's the same old place. You're not telling me something new. It's Marvin, right? Right. Where are you from? New York. New York. Then you probably don't remember my store. I had the biggest clock store on the west coast. Everybody bought their clocks from me... people in the business, your business. So I know something about this. What did you think of the script? I didn't read it. It looked professional, and Peggy likes it. It's a terrific script. Of course you think it's terrific. It's your job to say that. What are you going to say, that it's shit? George. Let them talk. Peggy, darling. Be quiet. You make things hard when you talk. A businessperson you're not. There's not too much chicken fat in this soup. Usually, I don't get a good bowl of soup unless I go to New York. There's no integrity in the restaurant business anymore. My father says the same thing. Your father is a smart man. So, what are you in this team? I'm sort of associated with the project. Stuart had the same teachers in college as Steven Spielberg. So have a lot of other people. Marvin. Marvin. Right? Listen. What part are you going to give my Peggy in your film? Well, uh, I'm not sure. I really haven't thought about it. I'd like to get to know her. There's a part in your script that she wants. What's the name of the part, Peggy? Zoey. Zoey. Yeah. The girlfriend. She's so deep. Yes. Yes. It's a great part. It's a wonderful part. But there's another great part, the part of the painter's model. The prostitute? It's not as big a part, but... It isn't the size of the role that matters. It's easy for you to say. But it's my money, and she'll play a big part. But it's my movie. I could have done it with a big television star years ago, but I didn't. She was wrong for the role. Maybe I don't have to play the girlfriend. What? You know, Marilyn became a big star after asphalt jungle, and she only did one scene. Sure. The point is to be noticed. Listen to me. Peggy will do anything to get into a movie, but I'm her promoter. You don't get any of my money so that she can play what you guys call an important but tiny part. I'm a smart guy, too. George, just let them talk about it. So many things can happen before a movie's finished. There's rehearsal, casting, editing. The prostitute could go from 2 scenes to 20, stealing the entire film. If the prostitute is the biggest part, then that's the part she'll play. I don't know if she can play that part or any part. Look, look, look. He's getting upset. I can't deal with someone who gets upset because I say what I want. To me, it's just business. The script is very important to him. Speak for yourself. Guys, get this together. I like to communicate with people, but the other person has to be someplace for me to communicate with them. Peggy and I took the form seminar, you know. We were in communicator classes together. Don't cast me if you don't like me. No. I like you. Marvin. You look like a nice boy. You're probably very talented, too, but it's my money, huh? Make a decision and get back to me. Andiamo,peggy. Let's go. No, no. You don't have to get up. Why did you... All right. I'll call you. Who is he, saying the script isn't finished? I've worked on that script for years. Who the fuck is he? He's a little green. He made a mistake. Who the fuck is he? What does he even have to do with this film? I thought you knew. No. Why was he even at this meeting? Jack, who is he? You've never heard of Stuart stratland? Stuart stratland? Two academy awards. He wrote sound in the river, death by any other name. Yeah. How... He's so young. Not him. That's his son, Stuart stratland Jr. He's just out of college. His son. What are we doing with his son? I know his father. He loves this kid. If we get in trouble with the script, he'll help US out. You know how much the guy gets? 500,000 easy. It's like getting the father for free. Besides, this kid wrote a very funny Sci-Fi thing about aliens. This film is about people, Jack. He's trouble. I don't need him. Did you hear what he said to George? Yeah. You're absolutely right. He was way out of line. If you want him out, he's out. But George seemed to like him a lot, and that could come in very handy when we close the deal. I don't want to blow this thing over something minor. I don't like the way George tried to bully me. Oh, that was terrible. I'm glad the way you stood up. He deserved to be told off. I was seething just listening to him. Do you really think he'll do it? He's a tough nut. He's trying to prove what a big schlong he's got. It's all bullshit. She's getting restless. That's why he came to me. She likes your script. Make her happy, and we're in. I can't use her. Would it hurt to audition her? She's not a dog. I wouldn't mind getting her alone in a room. Why can't she play the prostitute? Even if she could, George won't let her. We land some sort of a name to play the painter, the little girl finds out she's playing opposite a star, she'll take anything. George will roll over and spread-eagle. Can I do a song? A song? There's no singing in your film, but there's a lot of acting in singing. No. That's just fine. Good. Great, 'cause I've been working on this song that I'm supposed to perform at this club in ventura. Actually, George's friend's the owner. And don't worry about what George said the other day. His bite's a lot worse than his bark. He really likes you. He really likes you a lot. He just doesn't understand US people in art. This song works really great if the speakers are just the right distance. So, have you done a lot of acting? Oh, yeah. I had all the leads in high school, but I really didn't learn anything until fullerton. What's fullerton? Cal state fullerton? I had a great teacher... Mr. Brocker. He was famous and on Broadway. And I did betrayal. He said I was very good. I didn't make any money as an actress, so I became a waitress at the lighthouse. That's where you sing while you wait on tables. My boss came on to me, then I got fired, then my house burned down. That's how I ended up with George. I see. You want to push that button for me? ♪ I'm a sex goddess ♪ we think the sex goddess has got US ♪ ♪ I'm a sex goddess ♪ we think the sex goddess has got US ♪ ♪ I'm a sexpot ♪ the sexpot has got US ♪ ♪ definitely has got US hot US ♪ ♪ well, i'm a love goddess... ♪ I can't use her, even if it blows the deal. Go with your instincts. You're the director. I'll never force anything on you. Besides, she doesn't want to do it. What? George got her a screen test for a horror film. When did this happen? Last night. She was all excited about it. Here I am giving her a chance to be in a real film. If it's released right, she's got a film career. What is she playing in this horror film? A hooker who gets knifed. That's really going to help her. I tried to talk her out of it. Sweet kid. So, um... I guess this is it. Hey. We got a script. It needs some work, but it's basically in the right direction. We got a director with a hard-on out to here. How many classy projects are there out there? Honey, we'll order in a couple of minutes. I couldn't sleep last night. I was going through the index card in my head. I got someone. There's no question that he's holding, not like some pricks that'll break your balls and there's nothing there. He's got a girl, too. Mister rasso... Hey, how are you? So you're back, huh? Paris seems to agree with you. Look at that tan. How was hialeah? I made a few bucks. I'll bet you did. I love that track. It's fast. Who do you like in the fifth? The fifth? Dolls of plenty. So be it. How's that stewardess? Still flying around? She works a couple days a week, mostly to Denver and back. You're lucky you got to her first, because I really liked her. I got a feeling about her. I really think she's got something. She been doing anything lately? She did a commercial for a friend of mine four months ago. Hardware stores? It's a tough life. It sure is. Give me 100 to win on 5 in the fourth. Thank you. 5 on 5 to win. That girl's really crazy about you. I can tell you that. She's a real winner, carmine. I don't like to hear it, Jack. She wants to marry me and have a baby. Can you imagine? Wonderful! Are you crazy? With my background? Jack, I'm so sick. I found myself cheating on her last week. Really? Every time she starts talking about it, I find myself having to cheat on her or something. Christ. I'm too sick. I don't deserve her. She's been sober for nine months. Her a.A. Cake's coming up. I'll never forgive myself if I blow it for her. I got to get a beer. Carmine... Sugar, don't forget the onion rings and the great slaw. Can you bring US some onion rings and slaw right away? Thank you. Movies, huh? I like movie people. I used to play tennis with some before I almost croaked from a heart attack. Movie people are freer. They do what they want. They're not afraid to use their heads. They don't put up with the bullshit dished out by the assholes of the world. That's what my father says. I never been involved in a movie before. It might be fun. So much blood in the world, might as well have a good time. Too many people getting blown apart before they have a chance. Sounds like it might be fun. I was in special forces. I seen a few things. In 'nam? And all around it. It was terrible. Don't listen to the bullshit about not getting a chance to win that war. We did every dirty trick we could think of. Those little guys still beat the shit out of US. I can tell you about things that happened that would make your hair stand on end. I hid in a tree while I watched my buddy get quartered down below. Anyhow... The idea of making an entertaining little film is a good one. What's it about? You didn't read the script? No. I'd rather get it from the horse's mouth. Well, um... It's a story about a painter. A painter. Yeah, a very special one. His work has a very deep effect on people. It's, uh, sort of magical. It, uh, it changes them. He can't stop himself from criticizing things that he sees are wrong. He's committed to the truth, and, uh, that brings him both great pain and joy. Sounds like a manic-depressive. I know guys like that. Is the whole thing about him? No, no, there...there's the gallery owner. He's interesting. He's fascinated by the painter. He tries to help him, but then he destroys him. Aren't there any women in this film? Well, sure, sure. There's the gallery owner's girlfriend. Uh, she's a very special girl. She's drawn to the, uh... To the painter and his ideas, and, um, he's charmed by her. He...he, uh... He teaches her, but, uh... But then lots of things happen. In the end, she goes back to the gallery owner. Sounds like a great plot, huh? Yes, but there's also another great woman's role... uh, the model. She's, uh... She's, uh... She's a prostitute. But she's, uh... Anyhow, the painter paints her. And then what? And then she takes her money and leaves. She's a whore? You mind if I say something? Please do. The prostitute's the only one who can see the painter for who he really is. She doesn't put up with the bullshit dished out by the assholes of the world. The prostitute has no illusions. Yet, in a way, she is more pure than anyone in the film. That's interesting. Is he working on the script, too? Oh, yeah. Stuart here studied with the same teachers as Spielberg. Aha! Ooh! Wow! All right, all right. O.K., uh... So the gallery owner is, uh... Ends up with the girlfriend. This is fun. Now, what happens to the painter? Does he marry the prostitute? Um...something happens to him. What? He... He passes away. He dies. Oh, death. That's depressing. No, it's not! You know the Phoenix, carmine? A rebirth! Not a depressing death, no. See, the gallery owner takes over the painter's persona and is finally able to fulfill his own dreams. The painter becomes immortal, and the two lovers have been brought together. What a story! I see. I see! So what happens? How does the guy die? Suicide. Oh, Jesus! Is there any humor in the film? Humor? Oh, yeah, sure. A lot! It... It's sad, but funny. You mean kind of like terms of endearment? Exactly. Terms of endearment. Terms of endearment. Boy, was that a winner. Yeah, I love comedy. She's very good at it. That's what I do best. In its own way, it's very funny. So, Marvin, when could we read the script? Imminently. Well, looks like we got a deal. All we have to do is make the script funny. I spent five years writing that script. I'm not saying throw it all away, just lighten it up a bit. Lighten it up? It's about a painter who's forced to jump from a roof. What's the point of the film... the main point? Well, it's about a man who... it's about an artist who'd rather kill himself than compromise, right? No, that's not... yeah, but... there's other stuff about relationships and the symbol thing, where the bird flies out of the painting. Want to make your statement? Fine. I'm just saying use humor. What humor? Like the painter. All he does is complain throughout the script. No, he doesn't. O.k., for instance, does he have to be a sad drunk? Why not make him a happy drunk? He could be funny and crazy and wild... destructive, but with a kind of irreverent wit, like Jack Nicholson. What do I do with the prostitute? That's the only part she can play. She gets two scenes, one line. She won't go for that. How about if when he first meets the prostitute, she doesn't want to be painted? She'll sleep with him but won't pose nude. It's against her ethics. That sounds like a joke. People are complex, Marvin. He tries to teach the prostitute how to paint. She reveals she once tried to kill herself. That would foreshadow the whole thing. But the painter isn't a prostitute. Drawing a parallel between suicides... but that's the point! She doesn't kill herself. She becomes a prostitute! And the painter refuses to prostitute himself and dies. Right? So the artist is different from the prostitute... Because? O.k., outline a few ideas, but nothing goes into the script unless I approve it. You got that? Oh, I'm from all over. Eight states, three foreign countries. I was an army brat... well, maybe just a brat. My senior year I spent in the aleutians. Really? That must have been strange. No, no, it was interesting. It was fun. I went to an eskimo school, listened to the radio a lot. Of course, it's cold up there. Oh, yeah, I can imagine. Before I was 10, I lived in one place all the time... weirton, West Virginia. I remember everything was broken down there. It was all grimy. There was black smoke that used to come out of the steel mill in the middle of the town. But I had lots of dolls. I used to play house a lot. It was fun. Was your father stationed there? No, no. My other father... my real father. Oh, yeah? What was he like? He's handsome. He had a wonderful sense of humor. Do you still see him? No, no, we used to, you know, but it's better now that we don't, you know? He loves me a lot. I know that. I... He...he just has trouble showing it. Some...some people are like that. You know, he thinks about me a lot. I...i... I can feel it. And sometimes I just sit, and I close my eyes, and... Just feel his love... Floating towards me. He sent me a card a few years ago. I...I'm ready. Betsy! Betsy, where are you? Betsy! Carmine's ready to strike a deal. So that's it. I mean, we're in business! We're better than in business. We're on a roll. The first money's the hardest. First money? What do you mean? Carmine's putting up first money. We'll get the rest someplace else. Not all the money? He went for half. So we're back where we started from! Marvin, will you relax? That's the beauty of the thing. Carmine has this friend who's loaded, really loaded. It just so happens he has this girlfriend. We're here to see Mr. Wright. Oui. Thank you, sir. Mr. Wright. Thank you, sir. The script is going to need some changes. Changes? What kind of changes? Carmine doesn't care if this film makes money. You don't either, because you're an artist. But if I'm investing in this film, it will make a profit. What you have here is a very, very dark, morbid script. I actually kind of liked it, but it'll roll over and die when it hits the market. I'm lightening it up, putting in some humor. You'll have a light morbid script with humor that'll bomb. Either way, I lose money. I thought you wanted to do this movie because of... Beverly? That's one reason. I need more than one. If I'm doing it, we're doing it my way. Input can be helpful. Arty films are making money these days, but you need to appeal to an audience's basic motive for going to a movie. To be entertained. No, to be titillated... to go to the movies to be titillated, to see sex. There's no sex in your film. You need more sex. There is some. It's just not obvi... Yes. I've confirmed those reservations. Make sure you get me the room with the terrace. Find out about that boat. Yes, sir. Good. Isn't your film about self-destruction? Well, sex is a form of self-destruction. As the photographer becomes more disturbed, his sexual obsessions begin to dominate and destroy his life. The photographer? The painter's a photographer. It's much more contemporary. He should be photographing nude women. His art and his sexuality should be forever fighting and chained together, distorting each other's emotions, and... that's the way I see it. Great idea! I hear the editing room is where real decisions are made, so I or somebody from my office will supervise editing. You got to be kidding... Marvin, Marvin... Mr. Wright, I understand your thoughts. I wouldn't be who I am if I didn't back my director on certain matters. Roth, you're three months behind on your mortgage. Your last two pictures destroyed whatever reputation you had. The only decent picture you ever made is credited to the kid's father. Don't bullshit me. I don't like it! We respect what you're saying. Jack's only trying... how old are you, son? 24. Talk to me in five years. Marvin, save your temperament for when you can afford it. You have more to lose than either of these guys. Be honest. Your life's a disaster. Your last film folded when that actor killed himself. You haven't done anything since. You're 42, you live in a shithole, you direct instructional tapes. I'm willing to give you a chance because I think you might be desperate enough to make this film work. You think I'm an asshole with money. I'm actually an interesting guy. Maybe one day you'll know me. We're not so different, Marvin. It's just that I create money, that's my art. I'm very good at it. Once I make a deal, I'm a man of my word. Think about it. Thank you. So, when do we, uh, all get to meet your fabulous friend Beverly? I'll give you her number. We're not seen in public. My wife wouldn't like it. It's excellent. Shall we eat, gentlemen? I'm on the pritikin diet, but the frogs' legs are excellent. He's right about one thing... I am desperate. Hey, none of US are in great shape. Listen, Marvin, I got a hide like a rhinoceros. I have to. I'm a producer. Money is money. Tell me how much you can take, because whatever it is, uncle Jack is behind you. A nude photographer chained to his sexuality? What is he talking about? There's always a way. Stuart's a clever kid. Let him play with it. Maybe he'll make it work for everybody. Am I really considering this? I want the lead role. I don't care what part little miss airlines gets, but it better be smaller than mine. I'll count the lines. I want a heavy, dramatic role. I won't do any nude scenes unless absolutely necessary and tastefully done. I'm not strutting my black ass around to give the grips a thrill. I want to sit down alone with the director and check him out. I'm not going to get jerked around. The moment I get the slightest indication you people are not on the level, I will wipe you out, and I can do it. Not only am I making it with Mr. Evan m. Wright, but I also happen to be screwing Mr. Carmine rasso, who also has an interest in this project. That's right. I'm fucking both your investors, so don't fuck with me. Any questions? You know, I've never had Sushi before. My voices were right. You think that life is nothing but not being stone dead. I could let the trumpets and banners and soldiers pass me by if only I could still hear the wind in the trees, the larks in the sunshine, and the blessed, blessed church bells that send my angels' voices floating to me on the wind. Without these things, I cannot live. And by your wanting to take them away from me or from any human creature, I know that your counsel is that of the devil and that mine... Is of god. You're a very good actress. Mm-hmm. You know, that was very good. I was pushing. No, I didn't get that. Well, I was. What are we doing here? I liked it, o.K.? I've looked into your background. Not much there. What did you find out? Anything good? You directed some pretty serious stage stuff in New York. Then you made a classy little film. The New York times said you showed promise. I suppose I was doing pretty good. And then you came to Hollywood. Yeah, then I came to Hollywood. Anyway, you, though... you know, you're... obviously you must be offered roles. I want a movie where I get to use my talent. The only things I get offered are either porno or horror films. Carmine liked you, thought it might be good for me. Carmine's... A g-good friend? You want to ask me something? Ask me straight out. I don't like to be manipulated. Now, this is where it's at... Evan taught carmine tennis when he was a tennis pro. Carmine backed his first racquetball club. Within a year, Evan bought him out and has been ahead of him ever since. We met on a double-date. Does, um, Patricia know? The girl's brain-damaged. Flying around at high altitudes. Besides, it's no big deal. What about you? I do what I want. Nobody owns me. Honey, don't come on to me. It gets in the way of the work, and I don't want any problems. Not that you're not cute, not in your own way. No, believe me, it didn't even enter my mind. Well, when it does, o.K.? So do I pass the audition? You made the call-backs. It's a floor-through, two blocks from central park. Honey, you got to see this place. Why won't you come? I want to. I want to, but i... there are these videos. How long do you think you'll want to stay at my mother's when you get to New York? It sounds great! It's just that I can't right now. Oh, there's a cab! Honey, if you like the place, see what the deposit is. Taxi! It's right across the street from the planetarium. That's wonderful! Wonderful! Love you. Get here! Bye-bye, honey. I miss you! I got to know what I'm doing. My wife's waiting for me in New York. Marvin, after our meeting with George and Peggy, you can tell your wife you'll be directing, not teaching. I think Peggy's wonderful. Well, I need somebody who can do more than sing she's a sex goddess. George behaved nicer than he did at canter's. He's impossible. He'll want Peggy to have the biggest part. He's in no position to ask for shit now that the horror film's fallen apart. With the money he'll fork over, we can make the film look like it should. You know, this film is about a guy's involvement with his art. How does he have time for three women? You're absolutely right. That's why I was thinking we ought to change him into a gigolo. What? It's just an idea. Did you hear what he said? You're the director. We're pulling over. The car's overheating. It was just a thought. Come on, stop it. I don't want to hear anymore. I'm tuning you out. Come on. We're a team. I'm going to piss. Let's just go with the other guys and get the deal signed. If Stuart's turning the painter into a photographer, won't you need a bigger budget for models and stuff? He wants to turn him into a gigolo, not a photographer. It's just an idea. Can't I even tell an idea? I'll go scout up ahead. Are you seriously considering turning him into a gigolo, or are you just out of your mind? To hell with you. You can write it yourself. Where are you going? We're in the middle of nowhere. Fuck you. You've got such great ideas, you rewrite the script. You're the guy who knows how to bullshit these guys. Why are you so upset? I love her. Marvin, I love her. It's eating me up inside, I love her so much. Who? What? Peggy! For god's sake...Peggy! Are you crazy? When did this happen? I amcrazy...an idiot who stabs himself like a scorpion. I adore her. I don't know what to do. Do you realize what'll happen if George finds out? Can't you think of anything but yourself? Can't you? I like him. He's really sweet, and he's crazy about me. But if George found out that I saw him alone, it would kill him. I owe everything to George. He saved my life. I owe him everything for that. Maybe we could meet at your place. What? George trusts me with you. He doesn't think you like me. This is insignificant. Not for me! The guy's allowed to look presentable! How am I supposed to shoot this with one bulb? Mr. Bertolucci, I goofed. I'm sorry. This is a business. I got to run this fuckin' place, and you're going off on one god damn light bulb! You're out of perspective. Darling, I love you. Calm down. You're a great artist. You're very thorough. Please. We got to finish this. Got eating disorders in the hallway. You waiting for me? No. Marvin. Right. Hey, kiddo, this is not a bad life. What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. Must I always be an emissary of gloom? Something's wrong, right? What? No. Everything is perfect. As a matter of fact, we got to start thinking about getting a production office. Now, there is this thing with carmine... you see? I knew it! Thank god I didn't tell Rachel! It's no big deal. His father has to cosign the check, so you'll pitch him the story or something. Interesting guy. Used to be the garbage king of Newark. She's beautiful. She...she seems to lift his spirits. And as he paints her, he photographs her. It...it causes him to be uplifted. He's, uh... and as he... his...he... his paintings become... pictures become further well-known, uh... He's a wild and crazy but wonderful guy. People love him. He's like Jack Nicholson in terms of endearment... But nicer. Aah! Who is it? Me...Marvin. Thank god it's only you. Let me in. I've got a bunch of groceries. I got to get dressed. Give US a second. We'll be right out. Cesar romero. Jack. Ed asner. Dennis hopper. Why not Dennis hopper? He's hot. Money. Robert culp. Will you stop? They're all too old for the part. What about for the gallery owner? I know. He's perfect... the singer from motley crue. Stop, Stuart. We need an actor. Stay out of casting. What about Klaus Maria brandauer? He'd be brilliant as the painter. He'd love the script. He's a foreigner. We need a name if we're going to get a good distributor. He isa name! You're short 2 bucks. Greg louganis. The diver? Yeah. He's got a lot of presence. You're good with actors. You'll make him look great. Jack, did you see mephisto? Brandauer's the guy! Ernest borgnine. He's too old! No! He's right there! Look! Stuart, get a script, quick. He's still too old. He won an academy award! Jack, what are you doing? Mr. Borgnine! Ernest! Ernest! Jack! Mr. Borgnine! I want to talk to you for a second! Can I talk... can I talk to you for a second? Ernest, please! Won't you even... there's a really great part in that! Seriously! Ernest, i... what's your fax number? We can... Maybe he istoo old for the part, but he's a hell of an actor. Oh, jeez. Come on, Stuart, you're overdoing it. Man, enough is enough. It's still my place, you know? Hurry up. Hi. Hello. Hi. Rachel? What are you doing here? Well, I missed my husband desperately... And the air fare was a giveaway. So. Well, what have you done with your hair? Hey, this is how all hip restaurateurs look. Wait till you see my tattoo. Oh... Oh, so that's what sex is like. I almost forgot. You get it more often when you're in the same time zone. What's this? Oh, yeah. "The fun has just begun." I wasn't at my best when I gave you this, was I? No, not exactly. You know...o.K. All right. What? What? Here. Now, this is sort of an idea for the waiters. Oh, wow. This is sort of tacky. Tacky? Get... oh, how dare you call la Dee da tacky? It's beyond tacky. New yorkers love to hate L.A., right? Soon they can satisfy their snobbery and their stomachs simultaneously. Where? At la Dee da. Aha! Zanily decorated with plastic palm trees and a freeway mural, la Dee da is going to be a delicious cartoon version of the big orange. From Turkey chili to the unusual designer pizzas... the food is going to be so much better than it has to. Opened by the young and vivacious Rachel landisman and her partner Paula Rose, la Dee da is going to be New York's new hot spot. Yeah. Bring your sunglasses. Is that how you pitch it? It depends who I'm talking to, but I can pour it on, yeah. You know what would be really great? If we could go to robata's. Robata's for dinner? Yeah. Tonight? Who can afford that? We can. I bring great news. We are not going to prison after all. I have paid off the entire American express. Great. Great. We should've made a reservation. Sure you don't want to wait in the bar? No. Let's take a ride and come back later. O.k. Mr. Wright. How are you? I don't know you. You're making a mistake. Boys? Now, boys. I like the food here. It's nice to see you. Who was that? He was right. My mistake. He looked like somebody else. I'm glad we're leaving L.A. I just feel so much happier in New York, and...and we're so much better in that city. Yeah. This place, I don't know, just...feels like bad luck. But...oh, you learn from everything... I guess. Fred thinks you'll get the job at queens college, but you have to fly there now and talk to the chairman. It's a wonderful job. I can't right now. I promised Bernie. Yeah. I just don't want you to lose it... So maybe if you came back with me for two days. Uh...there are these videos. I've...i got to finish them. You're having an affair. What? There are Bobby pins all over the floor. Ahem. No, I'm not. I'm... there are these people. They're using my place to rehearse. Marvin... no. Uh... Rachel, i... I got to tell you something. Um... You know that crazy idea that when you really want something, it won't happen, but when you forget about it, there it is? It's true. What do you mean? Guess. I don't know. Guess. I don't know. I... you won the lottery. The darkness and the light. Oh. I said I had to think about it. It's so easy this time. We're either doing it or not. I'm just waiting to sign. That's why I didn't tell you sooner. See, these people are quite reasonable. They have constructive criticism. We're making it more modern. We're turning the painter into a photographer, but I'm getting to tell Warren's story, suicide and all. You know, I thought... If I set the last scene in Michael's room rather than up on the roof, maybe I can use the real building in the background. It'll be our secret. Zoey and David stand for a moment in the center of the room, not knowing what they want or why they came there. We cut to the frail, human possessions that inhabit the room. A pair of shoes near the bed. A few pennies on the kitchen table. They turn to look at the photographs that line the walls. Pictures that glow with the marvelous radiance from the passion that burned within him. There should be something almost embarrassing about the beauty and intimacy of them. Suddenly David... Is drawn toward the balcony... Trying to confront... The reality of the leap. The insanity of it. And as he looks down to the streets of the city below, he understands what it's like to want something so much that it can destroy you. The emotion's so strong that they... they push it or reach out beyond everything that holds you to the earth. Marvin. You're an asshole. All you ever think of is you, you, you! You never believed in me! You're just like my father! Oh! Because he had such a shitty time in Russia, he thinks no one could have any luck anywhere! I said, "pop, you're in america now!" Rachel, you're the asshole! Marvin, don't be self-destructive. The seven years that we tried to make that film were like a horrible accident. We're just now starting to pick up the pieces. I'm happy for the first time in years. Marvin... Please don't take that away from me. Please. Don't. Oh. Please. Please don't. It was terrible. Sometimes I didn't know if I loved you anymore. Oh, god, you're right. You're right. Please don't scare me again. Please. Forget about the film. It's crazy. It's not crazy, honey. It's not crazy. Your film could have been beautiful, but no one wants to see it. How can you say that? No one's ever had a chance to see it. You're right. You're absolutely right. They should see it. They should see it. But to the money people, a film about a frail artist and his death, that's a joke. To them, Warren's just some loser who deserved what he got. You're right, honey, but there's nothing we can do. That's the bottom line. I'm sorry. I've got to get something to eat. When a spirit like Warren's is squelched, the world loses something great. You know that. Yes, Marvin. We know that. They don't care. What...what is this? I care. Marvin, you were the last thing that Warren couldn't cope with before he jumped. What you care about is your guilt. Can you clean out the refrigerator once in a while? Should I make a film about something I don't care about? Car racing? Your film is about a man who didn't have an inch of talent for living, so he solves all his problems by throwing himself off of a roof. You didn't used to see it that way. But now that you can pay off American express, that's how you see it. Yeah, 'cause i'm a sellout, right? I'm a big sellout. And you're... Everything you do is right. This is the real world. Birds in paintings don't fly away. They just stay there. Don't you dare make fun of that! I'm not. That's the thing. I don't think you understand that birds in paintings don't fly. People can't have everything that they want. They can't have that. You have to stop dreaming. You are such a talented man, and you don't have a single thing to show for it. You live like a hermit, my brother is your only friend, you make videotapes for some jerk that you hate. You live like a college kid, Marvin. I...i...i can't believe it. Well... But I am going to make this film. Fine. That's fine. But you're going to do it without me. You're right. The real mistake is I didn't let you go earlier. What are you saying? I want you to go. There's no way I'll ever beat this. It's what I am, honey. What else am I here for? Well, maybe... If you...if you really thought that... don't give in. I mean, who are we kidding? This may not come together, and if it doesn't, I don't want you to be around me this time. I love you. I want you happy and far away. Please let me take you to the airport. No. Ah! Dah! Ah! Marvin, Marvin, Marvin. You're killing me, Marvin. You're killing me, Marvin. Just do it. This is not the script we agreed to. Just do it! O.k., o.K. Life is too beautiful. There's always another day. Is that good? Keep it rolling. What are you doing? Rolling. Just do what I tell you to do. Get back to one. Back to one. 250 feet, chief. In six. Action. Life is so beautiful. There's always another day. Good for you? Oh, my god!Aah!No! Basically, I'm playing with the idea that there's like, a happening in the universe. The story focuses on four people who live near one another. Now, because of this energy thing, one of them is destined to die. It could be Peggy who's so sensual and lovely. Or maybe Patricia who's light-hearted and funny. But the main suspicion falls on Beverly who is so dramatic that you have to wonder about her past. Certainly not the photographer who seems so normal and successful that... That's it. I'm going back to the original script. I'm not making any changes. Any changes. Marvin. What are you talking about? They won't make the film. Don't be self-destructive. Help me, Stuart. Help me, will you? You're a smart guy. It's a great story. Just help me use these women to tell it and get it made. I never told you what this all came out of. It's about that actor committing suicide on your film. No. It's about how I killed him. What? Believe it or not, Stuart, once I was pretty hot. From an old novel, I wrote a script about a ruthless gambler who destroys someone he loves. Life changes for him, and then, isolated and desperate, he realizes who he is and kills himself. Pretty grim stuff, but... I got Warren zell. Warren was a very special actor. He was an original. But he'd been through a lot, and he wasn't acting anymore. See, I had been his student. He trusted and liked me... And I convinced him it would give what he had been through meaning. Warren was amazing. The film suddenly had a... Incredible mystery to it. Actually, it was too good. The producers loved the rushes and thought it might be a Christmas release. Oh, they had one small change... take out the suicide. Instead, have the character recite some speech like, "there's always another day." It was, um...4:00 in the afternoon. I had a terrible headache. I can still hear the thud. God, that's sick. He was crazy. Of course he was, or he wouldn't have jumped. But he was too weak to fight US any other way. He had to remain honest to himself, and the suffering he represented. I was betraying him, turning this into an insane farce. Don't you see, Stuart? This is what the film needs to be about... the fact that not everything is for sale, that some things just have to be left as they are. Help me, Stuart. I want his death to mean something. Marvin, they're only making this to put their girlfriends in it. Take out the painter. He's a photographer. We can't take him out. The whole thing revolves around him! O.k. Leave him in, but take out the suicide. What, are you crazy? After the trouble we went through to sell it? That's the only element everyone agrees on. I can't bear him dying amidst all this crap. Let him get hit by a car, leave town... it's a little late for that. Marvin, the suicide stays. You take it out. I won't have him turn into a comic book. I won't murder him again! I'll kill you. Don't take it so personally! You're going to murder him. I'm going to kill you! Hold it! Sorry, dad. I don't know where junior gets the idea that the writing game is some fucking picnic. As far as I know, you not only need gracious amounts of talent, but balls of steel. If I never wrote again, it would be too soon for me. I remember 1962 in the high sierras. I almost shot peckinpah's big toe off 'cause he wanted to cut a scene of mine. That's when I gave a shit. You want a drink? We were hunting bear. Bear. That's real. Junior, go down and get US some ice, will you? Let me give you some advice, landisman. I don't know what's going on with junior and this screenwriting. Probably some phase he's going through or something. But you're a little long in the tooth to be playing the auteur game, don't you think? There's a weird kind of respect that you get for making anything... Even a piece of shit. You're in the club. From where I'm sitting, that looks like what you need. It's all a fucking charade, anyway. Marvin? What about my two points? Will they give in on them? They won't take any points from their share. I fought like crazy for it. Why don't we each give Stuart a point from our share? Stuart, you've been very helpful, but a point is a point. Then pay cash. I'm killing myself on this script. It's supposed to come from them. Jack. All right. You got the points. If he's willing to give up one of his, why not? God knows you deserve it. Fine. That's it. Everything agreed? Yeah. I'll take care of it. I got to draw up those papers because George is throwing a party tomorrow for Peggy's voice teacher, and everybody's invited. He thinks it's a good time to sign the contracts. Will the script be finished? I think so. Come on, guys. Let's celebrate. Are you still doing that comic thing? No, but... don't tell me. Just finish. You know, Marvin, when this picture hits the theaters, the only thing we'll have to worry about is what floor of the black tower we're going to piss out of. From your mouth to god's ears. I'm telling you. So what the fuck happened to you, Jack? You used to be a big shot at universal. Why are you cocking around with deals like this? Yeah, well. You know, I loved working at the studios. I'm not one of those guys who knocks them. It was Fritz benings. He screwed him. No. Bullshit. I screwed myself. Oh, god. Benings was the head of the studio when I did the stradler picture. Classic asshole. I had to fight him for everything. I had to fight him for...The budget, the stars, the director, but despite him, I got the picture made my way. It's the best damn thing I ever did. Then when it looked like it was going to go big, he suddenly decides he wants his name on the picture as co-producer. I should have given it to the prick, but... This old street thing came up, and I had to fuck him. I mean, if it had hit, I would have gotten away with it. But... It bombed. Then I was just another loudmouth. Haven't worked for a studio since. For 15 years, I've done nothing. What a jerk I was. You did that scuba diver film. That piece of shit? Now I got to crawl around on my hands and knees to get a couple of bucks for something. Jesus, I did it to myself. Now I look back... All those years have disappeared like a coin sinking in the sand. This life...This one life. Jack... This film will be a new beginning... For all of US. To new beginnings. To new beginnings. Did you just get off the boat, buddy? I'm telling you, I'm the producer, Jack roth. They don't have our names. You have Stuart stratland? Stratland... Yep. Stratland and two guests. All right. You can go on up. I know teak, ebony. I'm an expert on wood. I love trees. Oh! Oh, what a dilemma to be torn between two gorgeous women. Oh, Jack. Believe it or not, this little fella is a genuine hans broker. No, don't touch it. It's over 200 years old. The mechanism is more precise than anything the Japanese ever thought of. Never loses a second. That's something, huh? I'd like to see the cuckoo. When does it come out? It's broken. Nobody knows how to fix the cuckoo. You know, Mitch has taught everyone. Just this morning, Liza sent him a bowl of flowers. George and I are so lucky to have him living here with US. I adore talented people. You put a scratch on this, it'll be your ass. I used to drink. Oh, I forgot the dip! Watermelon and jalapeño. I'll help. After all, we're going to be working together. You are such a sweetie. I can tell we're going to be buds. I'll help, too. Uh, no, thank you. It's girls' work. What a tacky party. What a terrific party. Have a burger. I will. I've heard about your famous barbecue sauce. It's not the sauce. My herbs make it delicious. So westmoreland asks all the officers in the room if they have any questions, and I said, "yeah, I got a fucking question, general." Where's Evan? He's flying in from Europe. How's the script? Europe? Don't worry. He's got to be in Tokyo tomorrow. But what if... oh! Oh! Oh, no, don't worry. No, no, don't worry. Don't worry. Most watermelon will come right out. Oh, hi, Beverly. Hi. Beverly, this is Peggy. Peggy, this is Beverly. Hello. Marvin, she's really pretty. I mean, really gorgeous. Boy, I can't wait to work together. This is going to be great. You've got dip in your hair. You know, I think I'm going to go change. You'd better be a good director with those two yo-yos. George, Peggy wants to bring the guests inside. We're bringing out a birthday cake for Mitch. Thank you. Everybody in the house! You want to come inside for some birthday cake? You don't know horrible. The tiles? The tiles in the bathroom are from Macedonia. Where's Macedonia? Greece, darling. George has detectives everywhere tonight. He thinks I'm having an affair with somebody in the class. Are you having an affair with someone in the class? Zip me up. So where's the script? I want to read it. Jack said you'd bring one with you. I called for four days. Where have you been? Where do you suppose? Alphabetically screwing everyone in my building. I'll go find Jack. Come here. Don't you ever leave the phone off the hook like that again. Don't play Donald Trump with me. You know you'll be sorry later. Fine. I'm getting on a plane for Tokyo in five hours, and that's it. Be my guest. That's it. That's it. Ahem. I did have an extra ticket, but I guess I don't n-n-need it! That's it. That's it. Where were you? Evan... Where were you? Evan... Where were you for five days? What? Evan and Beverly are fighting. Because I don't have an agreement to take you everyplace. I do have to take my wife now and then. Let's get the contracts. Eh, hiya, buddy. Hi, Evan. Hi. Beverly. Carmine. I was just telling Evan we really should meet more often. I really miss our little get-togethers. Ha ha ha ha. She's quite a girl. You want her? She's yours. No, no, no. She's yours. Let's go inside.

Uh, look, um, Jack's going to have the papers by the pool... fine. Who cares about this fag's birthday? All right, who wrote the song? We did! We did! We did! Ha ha ha ha! Well, thank you very much.

I do, too. I'd like to be alone. Sure. Are you all right? You think I'm some kind of whore, don't you? I have a job. I have my own apartment, and I pay my own way. The only reason I ever thought about getting involved in this stupid little film was 'cause I thought it would bring me and carmine closer. All I ever wanted was to marry him and have his children, but he's just like the rest of you. You're all a bunch of liars! Marvin, be honest with me. I won't get upset. He's not worth it, o.K.? Just tell me the truth. Is carmine having an affair with Beverly? Gee, I don't know. I hardly... aah, no! God! I can tell by your voice he's cheating on me! How could he do this to me? Oh! Well, i...i... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I feel. I just... if it wasn't for your stupid little film, I never would have found out! I really don't know.

Cut the crap. You're skimming off points for yourself. You're stealing from US. Heh heh, roth. That's a legitimate cost. You don't know the movie business. I use that in my own contracts. Are you trying to bullshit a bullshitter? Marvin, do me a favor. See if you can find Patricia and ask her to come in here. I think she said she was going for a walk. For a walk? She didn't feel well. Patricia? Oh, god. The bottom of page 8. What's going on? You got it? That point's going into your pocket. It's for the script. The writer deserves to be paid. Not out of our share! That's the deal that was made with the lawyer. What are they talking about? We agreed to split it. I took one out of your share. Why can't they take the other one? You think you're selling herring on Delancey street? We've been over this before. Take the points from my share. No! The writer's not paid that way! Roth's not that far down. Why break our balls if we don't get our fair share? I don't like dishonesty. This is a small thing. It's not a small thing, god damn it! Enough of this taking the rear crap! These guys should suck my cock! Watch it! Watch it! Shut up! I'm sick of them. Relax, relax. Roth, calm down. If Marvin wants to give up his points, it's all right. What are you arguing about? I've been flying for 12 hours. I've got another flight for another 12 hours. Don't waste my time. Excuse me. Hello? Marvin, I've been in this god damn business for 30 some years. Fucking loser! Don't you dare blow this! No, I can't take the kids to school. I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow morning. To Tokyo? Evan... Beverly? I have nothing to say to you. You didn't like the script? The prostitute's roommate is a black girl who's in exactly three scenes. She's naked in two and gets stabbed to death in the third. There is an angelic blonde who's in every scene and dominates the entire picture. I wonder who gets which part. The truth is I haven't read the script. You've got some scam, Sam. I actually thought that you might be... An artist, but you're just another pimp. Do you think I studied six years with Stella adler to do this exploitative bullshit? I have something very beautiful and valuable inside of me, and one day... I'm going to get to show it. Look, I never meant for you to do this... go fuck yourself, Marvin. The bottom of page 8. Page 8, the bottom. Guess it's only a point. It's just a point. You really tried to Jew US down, didn't you, roth? I resent that. I'm sorry, but I'm disappointed. I thought you'd be a better thief. You know what your reputation is, you son of a bitch! Shut up! The whole world's blown apart, and you're talking about a few stupid details! Shut up! I'm sorry. I really like you guys. You work it out anyway you want. I got to go find Patricia. You should take the form seminar on integrity. I love you so much. You bruised my arm, you little fuck. It's over. I'm sorry. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Don't bother. I'll kill myself. No, wait. Marvin, Stuart's out of control. He'll blow this whole thing. If George finds US in here... so there you are. Get out of my house. George, it's not what you're thinking. You're both disgusting. That's why you keep going to his apartment? No. I didn't do anything. I'm really mad at you this time, Peggy. Go to your room! Get out of my house and take your gangster partner with you. Peggy! Make that two tickets for Tokyo tomorrow. Thank you. You're very special. I am. Let's get out of here. Patricia... You know my background. You know what a jerk I've been, but if you're willing to take a chance... Carmine... Are you asking me to marry you? Yeah? Oh... Didn't go as well as I had hoped. You o.K.? I'm just a pussy-whipped hack, aren't I? Come on, kid. Come on. She's a pretty girl. It happens to the best of US. Well, musketeers, bloody, but not bowed. Who the hell do they think they are? Three assholes trying to buy their way into Hollywood. You know, I always believed in this picture, and I go with my hunches. I'm putting everything I got behind it. What do you say? What do you say, chief? Does that mean he doesn't want to do it? Star wizard. In October, the planets are further away than last year. This positive... this promises a generally positive picture in the universe. The astrological prospects... Push in. Are good for that new addition to your home that you've been putting off or to further your commitment to that loving relationship. Pull out. Star... Wizard. Have a good year. Hello. Marvin... How's everything? How's your life? What you been doing? Who is this? Out of sight, out of mind, huh? It's uncle Jack, Jack roth. Yeah, I'm sorry, Jack. Um, how are you? Marvin, I can't blame you for trying to forget about me after that thing with those schmucks. It sure didn't turn out the way I wanted it to. That's o.K. You did what you could. I picked up your script again, and I couldn't put it down. You should never have touched it. I had a feeling about that script, and I still do. Jack...Jack, listen. I don't want to get involved with this again. I've got to face the fact that nobody's will make it. Even if they do, they won't make it the way I want it. In the real world, you don't get your dreams, and that's o.K. There are other things in life, and I want to get on with them. I...i understand how you feel. The only reason i'm even bothering you is because I met a guy at the friars' club today and he's loaded, and he's hot to get into the film business. I'm having a meeting with him tomorrow, and I figured I'd invite you along. What time? Captioning made possible by live home video inc. Captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
