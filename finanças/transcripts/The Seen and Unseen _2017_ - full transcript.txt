I need to see the doctor first Just wait here. He must be missing Tantra a lot. Just keep him here, or else your mother will be angry. Is Tantra your older brother? Your younger brother? He's my younger twin brother. Oh, you're "buncing" boy-girl twins. People say that "buncing" twins are a symbol of balance. You're lucky to have him, and so does he. You two complete each other. You must take care of each other. Is it good? This is a tale of a cuculus bird... ...many mountains, ravines, and forests. Oh dear God... says the grieving bird. Knowing the end will come to her soon, after she gave birth to the child, the bird is broodingly gazing up at the moon. Then she remembers the story about the moon goddess who is eaten by Kala Rawu, the evil giant. The smell of sadness... Feels faint... It is a sign... The threatening danger... Help... Help... And here is the evil giant. Help... Help... Help... Help... Help... Help... There goes the moon, eaten by the evil giant. Then what happens to the moon? Tell me, quick.

How could I bring it here?/ Just use anything and bring it to me. It grows bigger, bigger, unreachable. How was it? What did the doctor say? Tell me. These are the rontgen and lab diagnosis. I don't understand. Tantra has a bump inside his head, and it is getting bigger./ What kind of bump? It's pressuring his brain, and affecting his nervous system. Nervous system? I don't get it. What did the doctor exactly say? He can't feel anything. His senses are already affected. They are not functioning anymore. He lost his eyesight. He's blind?/ He can't hear as well. Our child... So the bump is the one causing it? Are his feet affected too? Yes it is. He's too sick. What should we do? How can we help him? Should we take him to another hospital? Please tell me what to do. Just keep praying, and wish him well. Eat your dinner, Tantri. I've told you, I don't like the yolk. Just give me the egg white. Just eat it. The moon finally came. The beautiful gold flower...

We will have rules and penalties. Yes, agree. It's for the water to flow the best in the paddy fields, so we won't face any problem. Yes, agree. Then we have to start planting. After that, the distribution of water would be clearer. Yes, the water has been divided into partitions. / The water has to be controlled as well. So there would be no fight in the paddy fields over water supply. How about the seeding. / Let's discuss it now. Should we look for it ourselves? / We could ask money to the village treasurer. Put it in the middle. Now there are two types: Gelis and Serang, Which one should we agree on? I think the Gelis seed is better. / Ok then, we will use the Gelis seed. About the pest in the fields. Please give good attention to it. Let's eat first. / Now is the season of rat pest. How could we handle it? Yes, now is the season. / Please, eat.
