I remember the first time I went to my dad's courtroom. I must have been seven or eight years old. And he was just doing calendar that day, sitting up there on the bench. God, I was impressed. I told him-- later that day, I told him... That I wanted to be a judge just like him. I was going to go to law school. [ Laughing ] And my father, he looked up from the dinner table and he said, "no lawyer will ever go to heaven as long as there's room for one more in hell." Room for one more in hell. One more in hell. - Hell, hell, hell. - [ Gunshot ] [ Screaming ] As long as there's room for one more in hell. Stanford. Fraternity man at delta kappa epsilon. Tight end of the football team. Law review. Pierce county prosecutors' office, seven years. Chief criminal prosecutor. Assistant counsel for the presidential commission on the L.A. riots. Appointed to the bench. Daddy swears him in. One wife. Recently ex. So not everything works out for our boy. - How do you know he's our boy? - I've watched guys like that all my life. [ Bailiff ] All rise. Court is now in session. The honorable Timothy Nash presides. Please be seated. Case number 8372190. People vs. Evan Charles soyka. Mr. Escobar, trial is set for-- ah, your honor, I asked the court for a continuance on the grounds-- come on, Vince. Screw this judge, man. Mr. Escobar, control your client or I'll have him removed. Your honor, he was only exercising his constitutional right of freedom of speech. - Don't push me, Mr. Escobar. - But, your honor-- Mr. Escobar, this is not a debating society. Trial is set for Monday the 14th of this month at 10:00 A.M. I talked Eddie killiam into buying that annuity. Talk to master calendar. Tim, I haven't seen your son Bobby. Not Bobby, Benjamin. He's living with his mother. Benjamin. Sorry, I forgot about you and Beth. The ol' foot in the mouth. Look, Tim, I hate this. We're not politicians. We're judges. We shouldn't have to run around asking for money. I said I'd buy a ticket for your dinner. I was really hoping for an endorsement. You know I don't think sitting judges should endorse one another. Look, Harold, I have a plane to catch for Washington. Well, uh, then, what about your dad? If I could just get a word from the great Nash family-- ask him. Ah, he doesn't like me. Then that's a problem, Harold. [ Man ] Judge Nash, you used to be a prosecutor. Why did you accept a seat on the bench? The hours were better. [ Laughter ] Judge Nash, we have this man, this rapist. Alleged rapist. Okay, who's alleged to have raped a nun. And who strangled her to death with her rosary beads-- alleged. Alleged to have strangled her. Judge Nash, you look unhappy. I am. Everyone has assumed so far that the accused is guilty. And so far, I have not heard any evidence that he is. This rapist, this murderer, this scum of the earth-- Attorney General cleary, you seem to have some sort of prejudice... Against the word "alleged." If he is what you say he is, he's going to need representation even more... Than the defendant who can afford to buy it. You would see that he got it? Absolutely. Let's assume that you were still in private practice. I would give you a call, I would say, "Paul, you remember that course in criminal law you taught me at Stanford?" You mean the one where I said that every defendant... Deserved the best defense possible. That's the one. He knows all the right answers. Knows all the right people. I'm sorry, judge Nash. I haven't had a vacation in seven years. I'm going with my wife to Hawaii. Tell her to bring you back a lei. [ Laughter ] [ Chattering ] You should have known I'd hit you with your own course notes, Paul. I've been deskbound too long, letting you blindside me like that. Neil! Somebody I want you to meet. Neil roemer. Tim Nash. Neil head's up our white-collar ethics team. - He's an admirer of yours. - I feel I already know Mr. Roemer. King of the stings. The private dishonesty of public men. That's the curse of the media age. I like to think I deal in honesty. - Oh, you find the honest people in the system? - Exactly. And as long as I've got you here in Washington, why don't you stop by the office? I'd like to pick your brain. [ Paul ] Don't forget dinner tomorrow, Tim. Judge Nash. Janice Dillon. Hello. Janice is my right-hand. You were at the taping. - Very observant. - Well, I train myself to notice who's in the courtroom. It keeps me awake. It's a trick I learned from my father. He learned it from his father. Who wrote about it. In my years on the bench, privately printed... On the occasion of his retirement. What else can I assume you know about me? You can assume we've done some homework. For what? Let's say, we have predicate information... That certain individuals have a predisposition to commit illegal acts. We could create an undercover operation... Meant to separate the honest from the dishonest. [ Janice ] Ashley, Harold. Judge at the superior court. We have probable cause to suspect that judge Ashley... Has accepted payoffs in exchange for favorable rulings. What kind of probable cause? Judge Ashley and wife Karen took a trip to acapulco last winter. A developer friend, one Carl brecht, wrote the trip off as a business expense. Ashley later threw out a zoning complaint against the developer. You know who paid for the trip because you have IRS support. The man in the flowered shirt is Carl brecht. This is still not probable cause. You know how courthouses are. Somebody gets a fancy new boat, somebody gets seen with too many developers or contractors... Or shady lawyers, and people start talking. Unless what they've said is backed up by substantive evidence, I don't listen. I have no substantive evidence against judge Ashley. You can get it. You want me to offer him a bribe to dump a case? If you saw my interview in the Washington post, I described this as creating a scenario... Where an honest judge, under suspicion, is given the opportunity to prove his honesty. Well, now, where Ashley and I come from, we don't get the Washington post. We don't even know what you guys are up to back here until we get the tax bill. And I have to tell you, you've done a whole lot of prep... To get one judge from one county 3,000 miles from here. You didn't have any trouble justifying the stings you ran as prosecutor. If I thought there was probable cause, if I thought there was a pattern of complaint... And if there was no way to catch the perpetrator. And of course, those perpetrators tended not to be white-collar. Not people you knew. That made it easier to justify. You can keep this. [ Tim ] So, you signed off on this. [ Paul ] Neil's a tough nut. Law school at night. Chip on his shoulder. Bomb shoot. But he gets results, and he works for me. Then it was your idea to bring me back here? Right. But not just to be on the show. That was just to appeal to my vanity. To run me past roemer. Why? You have the bona fides. You could have a future at the federal level. I'm about to try a murder case. I don't want anything to happen that could cause a mistrial. The prosecutors' office already runs in the red, and they can't afford to try the case twice like they do now. I still believe in the jury system. It won't interfere. You have my word. I still got trouble with this, Paul. Even though I don't like Harold Ashley-- well, maybe especially because I don't like him. It doesn't have to be personal. Every judge in that courthouse is either... A friend of my father's or someone I grew up with. So believe me, it's personal. [ Sighs ] [ Woman on phone machine ] Hi, Tim, it's me. Call me when you get back. Ben saw you on TV and wants to say hi. Here, Ben. [ Ben ] I stayed up to watch. And you know what, dad? You were great. [ Tape rewinding ] I stayed up to watch. And you know what, dad? You were great. You want me to offer him a bribe to dump a case? - ...a bribe to dump a case? - He's not locked in. Oh, he will be. Cleary doesn't like squeezing anybody. Oh, cleary. Cleary likes seminars. Colloquies, discussions. Guys like cleary and Nash, they are the old boy network. I'm not in that loop. You want me to offer him a bribe to dump the case? [ Laughter ] [ Tim ] No lawyer will ever go to heaven, dad always told me, as long as there's room for one more in hell. [ Laughing ] So, dad, on your 75th birthday. [ Cheering, applause ] Oh, well, thank you. Let me remind you, Timmy, hell isn't filled up yet. [ Laughing ] Lionel, this is for you. Oh, thank you. Ruthie, are you still carrying? You sentence the way I do, you better believe I'm still carrying. [ Laughter ] You know what they call ruthie now in the p.D.'S office? No. Yes, the time machine, if you can't do the time... [ All together ] Don't do the crime. Oh, ruthie, ruthie. Frank. I want to toast my family. Hillary... And Timmy. And all of US here in this room. For better or for worse. We are the people who hold this town together, and we haven't done a half-bad job of it. We've stuck together. We've looked out for each other. We've taken care of our own. I love you. God bless you. Finally came to the conclusion the courthouse is just a giant toilet. If you're going to tell me that plea bargain is the drano.. That keeps the crapper unplugged, frank, I've heard it before. Ah, I'm just having a bad day. All I can see ahead of me is shuffleboard and a cut-rate retirement community. When these slick lawyers march through my courtroom, I wonder what I had against being one of them. Okay, we've got 40 people. We've got ten minutes. Come on, people, hustle, hustle. Too late to powder. Now, if you can't see the camera, it can't see you. Oh, Tim, I want you next to the presiding judge. Harold! I got your memo on the short close delays. What do you expect me to do? Trot around delivering files-- if I don't get the files-- we'll talk about it later. Dwight! Yo, first group photograph! Oh, new judge. End of the line. Just like the supreme court. Get rid of the juice. Alright. Suzanna! Suzanna! Where is she? Suzanna, you got to go next to Dwight. Next to Dwight. Alright. Frank, come here next to Tim. Harold, I hear you gave a rapist ten months of community service. It wasn't black and white. The supposed victim had history-- if it would've been my court, the germ would've done Star Trek time. Mr. Spock would have been back by the time he got out. Glasses. - Could we take this, please. - Yes, ma'am. All systems go? DEA has it set up. It goes down tonight. Looks like a no-show. DEA said this guy Dale would be here. I don't mind having a bust handed to me... And a warrant in place. Yeah, if this is such a good bust, why is the DEA just gonna hand it over to US? ** Not tonight, conchita. Louis has got business. We're setting up a drug case. One we control. Sometime tonight, a defendant named Louis Dale will enter the system. What you'll offer Ashley... Is the chance to do Louis Dale a favor. What's he looking for? Damned if I know. We wait a couple blocks so we can say we saw some bad driving. Nah, screw waiting. Let's go. I'm calling for back up. Let's go! [ Janice ] You could have met Louis when you were a prosecutor. He did a deal for you. You did one for him. You'll tell Ashley you can arrange to move Dale's case into his court. He's going to wonder why I'm suddenly on the take. You're separated, maintaining two households. You made $80,000 last year. Fifty-one after taxes. Or roughly $4,250 a month. Fifteen hundred of that goes for child support. You and your wife have $26,000 in equity. And your sole joint asset, a house purchased at the time of your marriage. You have a loan on your car with $13,650 outstanding. Your collar is frayed. You haven't bought a new suit in two years. Judge... You got money problems. You didn't even get the furniture. [ Sirens wailing ] Can I see your license and registration? I saw you weaving a bit back there. Okay, I know. Do your thing, I'll do mine... And you tell everybody I'm doing just what you say. Just give me the license, please, sir. I'm going to ask you to step out of the car now. Hey, hey. Give me a minute to get my stuff together. Get out of the car. Hey, when I tell you to do something, do it. Get out of the car. What are you trying to do, greaseball? It's looking good. Real good. How about if I run and you chase me and make US look even better? Ahhhhh! - Freeze! - It looks better, right? My running? See how easy I am to work with? Anything you need me to do, I'm your man. Hey, you want to check out the trunk? Hey, hey, hey. We got four gram bags in the glove compartment and two under the seat. That's six to eight ounces. Maybe even more. Pretty easy to find too, wasn't it? Just laying there. This is a good bust. Come on, man. It was waitin' for US. What's bugging you about this? This is definitely a set-up. [ Laughing ] They're gonna stick a needle in my arm, and I'm never gonna wake up. Do you understand what I'm saying? Ev, I've got five clients sitting on death row. Five. I've got 16 more the state wanted to put there. But I saved their asses. And I'm gonna save yours. So stay calm. Calm? I'm calm. I'm always calm. [ Louis ] What did I tell you? Louis doesn't fool around. Told you I'd make bail. Couple more, and you're out of here, germ. Hey, thanks a lot. You guys are doing a really great job. You got a tissue? Damn it! A crooked machine in the police department. Why don't you see the counterevidence. - You don't remember me, do you? - Dale... Louis. Four or five years ago. Superior court, Seattle. Judge Hanover's court. Possession with intent to distribute. Ah, but I got it busted down to simple possession. But you were a two-time loser. So you got two years. Time off for time served. - You paid ten grand. All cash. - Small bills. How are you, Louis? It's good to see you. Never forget a cash customer. Are you screwing up again? Are you? Do you need my services? Oh, don't worry about Louis, Vince. I'm working on a very big deal involving very important people. - You'd be impressed if I could talk. - So talk! No can do. [ Laughing ] What do you think? Oh, he's just a big talking, small-time con. [ Louis ] You got kids, judge? I got a kid. Two, I think. Child support's against my religion, so I'm not exactly sure. Louis watches out for Louis, if you get the drift. What did they promise you, Mr. Dale? Well, I told you the deal. I'd like Mr. Dale to tell me. Do you mind calling me Louis like you know me? I got some charges in king county. Illegal distribution. Controlled substance. Morphine stolen off a truck. There's a related federal charge. Same offense. Yeah, transportation route. I've been in the joint two times. I don't want to go back. And this will fix it so you don't? - Louis sincerely wants to help. - Yeah, I want to help 'em uncover bad judges. - Don't jerk me around, Dale. - Bad judges offend me. ** [ Chattering ] Ah, ah, ah. Name out front. You're in the service business. You never know when somebody who might kick in for your next campaign. - Oh, do you know Cindy? - I knew Cindy when she was with the narco unit. Never lost a case, did we, judge? [ Applause ] Let's hear it for "tropical heat," ladies and gentlemen. My friends, I look in the crowd. I see 15 standing judges, muni and superior, all showing the flag for the big guy. And I want to thank each and every one of you very, very sincerely... For coming out here tonight and showing your support. Now we have food, we have drink. And don't forget to vote for me. Thank you so much. [ Cheering, applause ] Yo, buddy, do I have one for you! You can accomplish more with a kind word and a gun than you can with a kind word and alone. - I'll remember that, ruthie. - Work on those love handles. They've got this deal. Shrimp, canapes, everything all for the price of drinks. Tim, how are you? I need to talk something over with you. Well, grab a bite and let's sit down. Not here. If you've seen your way through to an endorsement-- it's a case, Harold. I need to talk about a case. Coming through my court? That's what I wanna talk about. If we could have dinner sometime this week. Thursday. Where? Neutral ground. Jack, Harold Ashley. Light. Mr. Escobar, I see no reason this tape should not be admitted into evidence. Motion to suppress is denied. Your honor, it's not even clear that the man in this tape is my client. - Then that's a point you can argue to the jury. - But, your honor-- I've ruled, Mr. Escobar. I've got a judges meeting. Bailiff, recall the jury and we'll adjourn for the day. I'm handing you $20,000 in marked government funds. Thanks. [ Sighs ] You'll be alright. I don't think I've ever held this much money before. I don't like the feeling. [ Janice ] There'll be a mobile unit in place at the restaurant. Agent Sanchez will be carrying a cellular phone, a concealed camera and a flying Mike. The sound isn't great, but we've made cases with it before. Harold. This is Louis Dale. You remember, I mentioned a case. No, you didn't mention you were bringing anybody else. I don't eat with defendants. I thought we'd have a nice meal, talk socially. No defendants. That's it. Get out of here. I'm sorry. Louis. Waiter, get judge Nash a drink, would you? Vodka... On the rocks. Yes, sir. So how do you know that guy? Umm. I first met Louis when I was prosecuting narcotics. He gave me some help-- snitch. Creep. Yeah, later on I was able to help him. I got rid of a possession case for him. Uh-huh. How did you do that? Ah, Harold, getting rid of a drug investigation... Is the easiest thing in the world. You know how it works. You bring in some technical infraction. I didn't, uh, consider it particularly-- excuse me. Your menus, sir. Thank you. It wasn't a particularly good bust to begin with. So you took a bribe? I'm saying that I saved the county the cost of a chancey prosecution. And what is the going rate for saving the county the cost of a chancey prosecution? Louis was picked up on a dwi with a significant amount of coke in his car, and the case is moving through court for arraignment. I could get it assigned to you. Twenty. Someone's in the way. Ah, who's that? Who's in the way? - Keep going. - He's willing to pay 20. To have the case fold up. Bad bust. Lousy search and choice. Cash? And what's your cut? That's between me and Dale. So you would pay the expenses out of your share? And we wouldn't have to talk to the perp. You know, you're the last person in this world... That I would figure would do something like this. Tap city, Harold. It happens. Well, divorce tends to do that. It's cheaper to stay married. Maybe she had other plans. What's it gonna be? There's not much time if we're going to put this on your calendar. No. That's it? Too many loose ends. But, what I do like is that it comes from you. The great Nash family. So now that we understand each other, how about that endorsement? I think I'll hold, Harold. Hmm. Well, excuse me. What's it gonna be, Harold? What's it gonna be, Harold? That's where you blew it. You didn't like him talking about your wife. So you pressed too hard. He yanked on the line. You got uptight and you lost him. Well, let's just call it one of those scenarios where an honest judge-- let's quote the Washington post here. "An honest judge, under suspicion, is given the opportunity to prove his honesty." You don't like me much, do you, Tim? I hadn't thought about it, Neil. [ Neil ] He didn't come up honest. He came up smart. Smarter than you thought he was. Correction. Smarter than you thought he was. Buy you a beer. I guess we owe you a beer. No, I'll buy. I don't want to owe the eagle. Let me get my jacket. You get somebody's father's car, you get a six-pack of beer and you came down here. That was pretty much your standard entertainment growing up here. How about you? Where did you grow up? Atlanta. Houston. Wherever. My father worked for a company that moved him around a lot. When I got out of law school and went to work in Orlando, it was the longest I'd ever been anywhere, five years. I liked it. Being in one place. Why'd you leave Orlando? Long story. Oh, I don't mind long stories. I do. Okay, let me ask you something else. Do you believe in what you do? What do you mean? The side show we just finished. You really believe it was worth it? I don't think this beer was such a good idea. Oh, you're not sworn. I can't direct you to answer. I believe... In me. We still got a deal, right? You got nothing to worry about. Now, I can't go back inside. I'm not a prison-type person. Louis, trust me. It'll all work out. [ Chattering ] Cindy, what's that hood doing in a place like this? Copping free nuts. Didn't he say he had something big going down? Just talk, Vince. Cindy, i'm an ambulance chaser. And he's an ambulance. Chat up your old friends in narcotics. See what they got new on him. [ Chattering ] What's up? Twin rivers. Mcneal island. The guy's got a standing charge with king county. Hell, he was running away from you. You should've shot him in the spine. [ Ruthie ] The defendant will rise. Your probation report is like reading a piece of pornography, Mr. Highland. Six priors on the same charges pleaded down to misdemeanor. Sexual battery. Bad mistake to go to trial, Mr. Highland. Accordingly, on each account, I sentence you to the maximum penalty under the law... To whit six years to be served consecutively. In other words, 48 years in the state. Your honor, I object. Overruled, counselor. And tell your client that his parole officer hasn't been born yet. This court is adjourned. Harold. So you miss working undercover, Cindy? Yeah, flashing those big boobs of yours around so folks don't think you're an officer. Yeah, I hate working nine to five, wearing clean clothes... Being in my bed instead of on the street at 4:00 in the morning. Yeah, who with, Cindy? Garvey, if you unzipped your fly, your brains would fall out. [ Laughing ] By the way, if you got anything more on this guy Dale, you got my number. ** [ Yelling, laughing ] - You know your work? - Sure. What about it? Is that all you ever do? Well, I'm not working now, am I? Right. Well, better tell mom that 'cause she thinks-- well, don't you worry about it, Ben. Will you ever show me-- show you what? Where you do your work? That's the way you do it? That's the way I do it. And that's the way your grandfather did it. And that's the way your great-grandfather did it. I wish there were other people here to see me. Well, you are in school when other people come, Ben. But when I have vacation? Sure. We'll ask your mom. Hey, ruthie, you're working overtime? No rest for the righteous, bubba. Ben, you remember judge Frazier? Ben! [ Laughing ] You're getting as cute as your dad. Timmy, we need to talk. I'll be in tomorrow, Ruth. I'd sooner this be at my place. I promised Beth I'd get him home around 7:00. My place. I don't care how late it is. [ Ruthie ] I've got one for you, Timmy. What has 18 legs and four tits? You got me, ruthie. The United States supreme court. [ Laughing ] Hey, quite a collection you've got here. Well, the boys know they'll get a hearing in my court. Mmm. Is your drink okay? Mmm. Oh, you smart little Ernie. And ed. The only two males allowed in my bed. You sure you're comfortable? I'm fine. [ Chuckling ] Well... I'm not gonna rape you. Even if you are back on the market. How is Beth, by the way? Fine. Sure I can't top off that drink? No, it's fine. [ Laughing ] Hmm. Your dad could drink all night. He had a hollow leg. You didn't get that from him. So... Timmy, I heard a story. - What has 18 legs and four tits? - Mm-mm-mm. About you from Harold Ashley. What's the story? That you tried to bribe him, buddy. Why would he tell you that? I'm the presiding judge. You know these stories that are floating around about Harold? He's trying to get on my good side. It's an iou. So did you? - Did I what? - Offer him money on a case. Two-time loser named Dale facing a drug bust. He doesn't want to go back to the slammer. Do you know him? I know Louis Dale. You are shopping Louis Dale? I knew him when I was in the prosecutors' office. Look, I know how this works. Find a friendly judge, get the case transferred, money changes hands. The judge gets some, you get some and the perp gets the case dismissed. No fingerprints. Life goes on. It's conjecture, Ruth. You're out of order. Harold mentioned a figure. Twenty-thousand dollars to the friendly judge. Hmm? [ Sighs ] I could be very, very friendly. It's only a matter of making some adjustments to get it transferred to my court. Cheryl could make the arrangements. Cheryl? My clerk. You remember. She was the one always trying to get you to screw her... In your bachelor prosecutor days. When you could have had the judge. Ruthie, maybe you better lie down. [ Moaning ] Ohh. Well, that is the best offer I have had, oops, in a long time. You better freshen this up. Come on. You should have come to me. I'm easy. I know. Come on. I'm just so sick of this job. All the faces look alike. I had this crackhead. She runs over her own kid with a power mower. Little girl's fat little fingers flying around like cocktail sausages. Where do you find the justice there? Then leave the bench. Go into private practice. First, we're going to get some sleep. Sure, private practice. I am a prized piece of woman power. Semi-lush going through hot flashes who hasn't been laid... Since the aba convention three years ago. You know that name tag you were looking at down there? I keep it there just to remember that guy's name. Kurt.... something. Oh! [ Gasping ] What a basket! Hey, ruthie! I'm going to get you an aspirin. I'll be right back. Well, I am available for that Dale scumberger... If you want to throw him my way. Twenty-thousand dollars. Where are my dogs? Ernie! Ed! Ernie, ed! Come up here. Mother wants you. So, are you gonna throw Dale scumberger my way? Well, speaking of hot flashes, are you having one? Shh. I'm sorry. Mmm. You ever get lonely, Tim? Shh. It's okay. I'm leaving now, ruthie. [ Moaning ] [ Screaming ] [ Ruthie ] I could be very, very friendly. It's only a matter of making some adjustments to get it transferred to my court. Cheryl can make the arrangements. You didn't have anything on her. You just thought you'd get her on tape for the hell of it! This is a sting. People who are dirty go down. People who are clean don't. Uh-uh. That's not the way this plays. This is a one shot-- one bad judge. See if he bites. He didn't. It's over. That's the way you saw it. But the way a sting works, we have to stay open. And we have to stay available for any possibility. The way a sting works is you need a snitch. I'm not your guy. Look, Tim, your name comes up for the federal bench. You know that. For the sake of your family. For the sake of your own future. Why don't you sting my kid? He's eight years old. He didn't file a 1040 last year. You can get IRS support. [ Sighs ] It's not your fault she went down. You're Ruth. You're on the far side of 50. You got two little dogs for company, and nobody even makes a pass at you anymore. I know this requires a giant leap of imagination, but try! You think this is going to be like the prosecutors' office? You think friends of the family are going to be off limits? - I'm out! - You can't get out. Yo, frak! Frank! What has 18 legs and four tits? The guys think the bust was funny to begin with. Eight ounces of stuff not even hidden. But no one ever called Dale a smart guy. Just makes the guys nervous. Did you tell him to call you? Mm-hmm. Now, Mrs. Beller, isn't it true you refused to see Mr. Soyka... Unless he paid you back the $1,000 you lent him? Objection. Calls for a conclusion. Overruled. But you're tying my hands, your honor. [ Judge ] You're trying to disrupt these proceedings... By objecting to every question posed by the district attorney. There is a difference between objecting and disrupting. When your objections are without foundation, they will be overruled. You may proceed, miss benisek. Didn't he tell you he needed money to enroll in a computer repair course? [ Mrs. Beller ] He said he wanted to acquire a skill. [ Janice's voice echoing ] You can't get out. - Objection. Here say. - So he did lie? Objection. Calls for a conclusion. To get money. Your honor... please. Objection. I'm sorry. Objection sustained. "Del rio heights"? It's a zoning matter. Agricultural into residential. One more subdivision. One less bird farmer going broke. You tell me where the moral high ground was there. You had a piece of it. You should've recused yourself. Instead, you made a ruling you benefited from... And you came away with a substantial profit. Why? For you. For your mother. In case something happened to me. That was 30 years ago. I don't remember why anymore. I did it. I shouldn't have. They're holding you hostage on this, aren't they? I'm old, Timmy. I don't give a rat's ass what people think about me. So... let me go. Cut me loose. It's not that easy. You know that. This isn't just about you. It's about the family. It's about mother. It's about Ben. Especially Ben. He will give a rat's ass what people say about his grandfather. And yes, I am being held hostage. I'm sorry, Timmy. Is he alright? Maybe you should go in. He doesn't sleep anymore. I did know, in case you were wondering. No one was hurt. The sun came up as usual. You want to know why I left Orlando? The question hasn't been bothering me. I found out my boss was taking kickbacks. Justice had him under surveillance. Neil roemer asked me to smoke him out. I had to leave. I guess you could say I was in your position. That still doesn't tell me why you did it. When I was married, my husband took a bribe. Roemer had evidence. I didn't want it out. After I went to work for roemer, I discovered that was one of the tricks the pros know. Always reserve a card you can play if somebody decides to cut and run. This was always wider than Ashley. Sure. [ Phone ringing ] I'll let you get that. Wait, wait. Please. [ Woman on phone machine ] Hi, it's me. Sorry to call so early, but it's about the house. They can't set a date for closing until-- [ continues, indistinct ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Children playing ] What are you going to do? I wouldn't say I have that many choices. I tried to bribe a sitting judge. I know a second sitting judge wants me to pay her off. My father is wondering whether a lifetime... Of service to the community is about to be trashed... For a lapse in judgement 30 years back. All things considered, [ dog barking ] I have to see my options as limited. Hiya, buddy. Would you like a drink? Sure. [ Lionel's voice ] They're holding you hostage on this, aren't they? [ Janice ] Harold mentioned a figure. Twenty-thousand dollars for a friendly judge. I can be very, very friendly. [ Tim ] I'm out! [ Janice ] You can't get out. [ Janice ] Initial contact, judge Ernest Chapman. [ Indistinct talking ] [ Janice ] Second contact, judge Dwight peatling. P-e-a-t-l-i-n-g. [ Dwight ] A tax lawyer. That's all this is. It's not my concern. It's organic crime. No one died. It was a drug bust. What's the difference? [ Janice ] 10:20 P.M. cash accepted. I want to help uncover bad judges. Hey, you're a big guy now. You're eight years old. A birthday's nothing to be sad about. I know. I know I said I'd be there. And I will, Ben. I promise. It's just-- something's come up-- second contact, judge Ernest Chapman. Cash exchanged. 1:35 P.M. First name is Dale. Not here. What do you mean it's not here? I signed the stuff in myself. Eight ounces of cocaine? My name. My badge number. Try the lab. I tried the lab! They say they never got it. You trying to make this my problem? You know what I'm wondering. You're wondering who Dale bought to make the stuff disappear, huh? That's right. ** [ Radio: Country ] What the hell is he doing up here? Beats me. [ Sirens wailing ] Jesus! What? Somebody's gonna love this. [ Tim ] Miss benisek, so the court might allot for time, how many more witnesses do you intend to call? Just three, your honor. I should be finished by lunch recess tomorrow. Then the defense can begin its case tomorrow afternoon. Mr. Escobar? Are you with US? Oh, sorry, judge. Friday morning would be better for me, if it pleases the court. It does not please the court. Tomorrow afternoon, Mr. Escobar. [ Car alarm chirps ] [ Tim ] What's on your mind, Vince? Just a story, judge. About a former client of mine. Cash client. Felony possession. Funny thing about this guy. He got picked up not too long ago... And the evidence just... evaporated. [ Sighs ] But he's always been one lucky guy, this guy. He has some outstanding charges in Marion county. He didn't even have to bother pleading them down. They just... disappeared. What do you think happened, judge? [ Chuckles ] Because to me, it looks like somebody's rolling over... To help this guy stay out of the joint. Dale's his name. Oh... I forgot. You and Louis are old pals, I hear. I could misinterpret that. Oh, believe me, judge. I haven't said nothing to nobody. So far. Nor do I want to. But, you know, I think I have a solution. You're a smart guy. You are. You are. You're always just thinking, you know? Say at the right point, I move for a mistrial? Some prosecutorial error. Um, I didn't get some report. Had to ask for the witness list. Stuff that I usually put in the appeal. And you Grant it. And if I don't? [ Sighs ] Well, the last thing I would like to do is go to the presiding judge. I could take you to the state bar disciplinary board tomorrow, Vince. Hmm. I would like that, judge. And risk having your ticket pulled... for this? [ Chuckles ] I'm not doing this for soyka. Is that what you think? [ Laughs ] It's for me. If I get a mistrial, I plead out this discount psycho. I'm king of the criminal courts. Well, goodnight. [ Door closes ] We've got a problem. Alright. Let me put this in perspective. Louis runs off at the mouth. Escobar gets interested. He sniffs around. He thinks he can scam a mistrial. I never saw a trial where you couldn't find cause to dismiss. This is a first-degree murder. He killed a 16-year-old girl. He is alleged to have killed a 16-year-old girl. Jesus, roemer! Does Escobar suspect-- is that all you can say? Does Escobar suspect a sting? No. Then whatever leverage he's got, he loses it the day we go public with indictments. We were looking at suzanna jardine, but she comes up with no anomalies. Frank whister? Why? Did some jailbird looking for a deal drop his name? A couple of them, as a matter of fact. Professional snitches. Well, cheer up. Virtue in my triumph. He won't do it. I know him. He's like my own-- father. What did you tell him? I didn't tell him nothing. But you know him? Sure I know Vince Escobar. He was my lawyer once. So you ran into him, wanted to be a big shot and ran off at the mouth. Louis, I need to know exactly what you told him. Nothing at all. If Escobar squeezes Nash too hard, this whole operation gets blown out of the water. And if that happens, you're back at mcneal island... Watching your ass in the shower room. That's not what we agreed on. Neil, please! I can't be responsible for Escobar! Guys like Escobar keep coming. I seen guys like him. Turn your back, they shake you. You got no control. Louis, you want to stay out of jail, you better start taking control. [ Door closes ] ** [ Brass band ] ** [ chattering ] ** [ Applause, cheering ] Bravo! Let's hear it for the kids! Come on! They're better than "up with america." Alright, alright. At ease, people. At ease. As far as I'm concerned, this is... The best moment of the year in this courthouse. A time-honored tradition started by Lionel Nash. Bravo! Lionel decided that we shouldn't take it out... On the kids of those people we remand at the penitentiary. So every summer we celebrate fourth of July... By reaching deep for the children of the felons! You're all heart, ruthie! You ought to be good for a large cash gift this year. ** [ Band playing "yankee doodle" ] ** frank. Remember the year we had maitais and ruthie did the hula? Come on home after this shindig. Pot luck, but you're welcome. Actually, I need to talk to you alone, frank. Oh, well, it's about time. You haven't been yourself lately. Is it the divorce? The trial? Living out of a suitcase? There's no point in getting old if people don't bring their troubles to you. [ Ruthie ] Frank! Your place, tomorrow evening. Lenora's having a book club. I'll be right there. Frank, raffle time! [ Laughter, chattering ] [ Thunder rumbling ] Do you want the lights on? No. Your mother is hoping that you'll bring Benjamin by... Now that school's out. [ Sighs ] I even had the pool filled. We could talk. Dad... I didn't think-- none of US did, Timmy. [ Thunder continues ] [ Chattering, shouting ] ** [ Humming ] ** [ Man on TV indistinct ] Hello, Tim. ** [ "La bamba" ] ** I'm gonna go get a drink. Vince! Vince! You and me gotta talk. You wanna talk? Talk to your pal, the judge. Let me buy you a drink. The one who thinks you're such an asset to the community he folds your jacket up for you. Vince, you been talking crazy. Just tell me what you got. Get out of the way. You don't got anything. Maybe you just talking big. - Just stay away from me, Louis. - I don't think you got squat. Oh, but I do, I do. And what I've got is gonna put you right back on the island. Hey, hey, Vince, just tell me what you think you've got, huh? [ Grunts ] Want me to throw him out, Vince? Why not? You want to send me back? Is that what you want? It's not my ass, Louis. Here. [ Laughing ] I got to go now. I'll call you. [ Train passing overhead ] So... the stories are true. [ Tim ] The walls in that courthouse have ears. Word is, you've got financial problems. [ Sighs ] Where is the damn case, anyway? That can be assigned to you in a couple of days, frank. The cash that you're holding... Is for me? If you want it. Hmm. You know, lenora thinks that when I retire next year... We'll take some trips, gonna see the world. On what I've saved, I can just about show her a weekend in San Francisco. It's drug money, right? Right. Well, there's the problem, Tim. My calendar's 60 percent drug cases. All that money is washing through the system. But I guess nobody gets hurt... If a little rubs off, hmm? Can I see the money, Tim? [ Frank ] Ohh! Ones. They're so damn neat. And all I do is write checks. Postdate most of them. Lenora would see this and think I robbed a bank. I don't know if I can do it, Tim. You see, we're not thieves. Not perfect people maybe, but... not thieves. It's up to you, frank. Your dad faced something like this once, and it didn't turn out so bad. I shouldn't have said that. A stupid remark. Uh, do you have a-- a bag? [ Sighs ] I was gonna sneak out. Easier than saying no. I've never been terribly courageous. Not even terribly honest. Honest only because I was too afraid not to be. I can't do it, Tim. This never happened. [ Door closes ] Virtue triumphed. Who's next? This one's a rap, Neil. What? He's not gonna play anymore. Son of a bitch. [ Tires screeching, car horn honking ] Hey, Vince! [ Laughing ] [ Tires screeching ] [ Horn honking ] [ Honking continues ] [ Honking continues ] [ Honking continues ] - [ Gasping ] - Stop! [ Shouts ] Ohhh! [ Screaming ] [ Chattering ] Carole. Highway patrol called US. I thought you should know. If you could be in my chambers early, we'll discuss how to proceed. I'm sorry, Cindy. This is your fault. What are you talking about? This was an accident. This was no accident. He had surveillance photos in his briefcase. Photos of who? He had the briefcase, and now it's missing. Photos of who? Of you and that sleazy Louis Dale. [ Louis ] It was an accident, I swear. Accidents happen. I saw his face. No, you saw nothing. You were not there. The car was smashed. I saw him die, Neil. I saw him die, Neil! I saw him-- you saw nothing. You were not there. Ladies and gentlemen, as I'm sure you've all heard, Mr. Escobar was involved in an automobile accident last night and was killed. This, of course, mandates my... declaring a mistrial... At this time. [ Murmuring ] Judge Nash. Hey! Mix and match for the grand jury, judge. It's finally happening. No, it's not. I want to get Louis through this quickly. Vince Escobar is dead, and Louis had something to do with it. I don't have any evidence of that, but I know it. Like I know the prosecutor's not gonna retry Evan soyka. She's gonna plead a lesser. And I don't think that's doing it the way it's supposed to be done. And I don't think you're doing it the way it's supposed to be done. I am not testifying. You have to. You're under subpoena. You know, I've sent people to jail that I used to work with. I liked them. I don't like you. [ Man on radio ] It's gonna slow down as you near the interchange. But officials assure US work will halt as the morning commute heats up... And it shouldn't affect your drive time. Coming up at the top of the hour, uncle macky will be here... And Bobby Ray's gonna recap yesterday's game. We'll be giving you more information-- [ Continues ] [ Phone rings ] Hello. Ruthie? Sure. Where? Ruthie? Ruthie? Remember when they used to can tomatoes out here? Sure. I put myself through college working in the canneries. Every August I'd be here or the starship plant. Of course, I got scholarships too. Why'd you ask me to come out here, ruthie? Try, "it's not bugged." [ Chuckles ] I've been adding things up. This guy Dale, he's a phony. I ran through his files. The old ones. You know why I didn't check them right off? I trusted you. You're working for the feds, aren't you? Mmm. No lawyer will ever go to heaven... As long as there's room for one more in hell. You remember, you said that at Lionel's birthday? Ruthie, just listen to me a second. I remember when he swore you in. I got a nice invitation in the mail this morning. Big awards banquet. Prosecuting attorney's association voted me... "The toughest sentencing judge in the state." Ruthie... I didn't think it through. Well, you know what I always say, buddy. If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. [ Gunshot ] [ Barking ] [ Tim Nash ] What I will present to you, members of the grand jury, is a pattern of official and judicial corruption, of bribery, of misuse of office and tax evasion. I will play you audio tapes. I will show you video tapes. I will bring as a witness a sitting judge... Who worked in close concert with the strike force on official corruption, and I shall show you why the court believes... Other sitting judges should be indicted... And subsequently brought to trial. I didn't know whether you'd come. Yeah, we don't get much business here this time of night. I wanted to come back before I left. First thing tomorrow morning. Remember I told you once I believe in me? [ Sighs ] I didn't believe you. [ Chuckles ] That was nice of you. Oh! Angel. Neil likes to have everything wired. He says you never know when someone you think is on your side... Is going to double back on you. I guess he was right. It was an accident. Accidents happen. I saw his face. No, you saw nothing. You were not there. Janice gave that to you, didn't she? I didn't factor in sex, but then how do you think she got where she is? You're out of business, Neil. [ Louis on video ] The car was smashed. I saw him die, Neil. I saw him die! I saw him die! You saw nothing. You were not there. [ Tim ] A case of vehicular homicide, and you suppressed evidence. And now you have a suicide on your hands. I think you're gonna need a good lawyer. [ Sighing ] Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! I saw him die! You saw nothing. [ Grunts ] You were not there. [ Tape rewinding ] You saw nothing. You were not there. [ Tape rewinding ] You saw nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Oh, my god! You were not there. Oh, my god! Hey, what's going on? Louis! Louis! Man, don't worry. You'll be okay. [ Whimpering ] [ Whimpering continues ] [ Chattering ] Good day, you all. I have a brief statement, and I will take no questions. I have decided to leave the strike force... And return to the private sector. [ Crowd murmuring ] [ Newscaster ] There is an announcement expected any moment... That Neil roemer's replacement will be his former deputy, longtime justice official Janice Dillon. At the present time, neither miss Dillon... Nor Attorney General cleary has issued a statement. Prior to coming to the justice department-- [ chattering ] - Hello, Tim. - Frank. [ Ruthie's voice ] Do you ever get lonely, Tim? [ Bailiff ] All rise. The court is now in session. The honorable Timothy Nash presiding. Please be seated. Case number h-467852, the people vs. Marjorie Wilson. [ Sighs ] We are about to begin voir dire. Voir dire is the process by which we select-- By which we select the jurors... Who will decide the merits of this case. May I remind all present that the accused... Is not obliged to prove her innocence. It is, instead, the obligation of the state... To prove her guilt, if such guilt exists. No man or woman who comes before this court... Can be judged guilty in the absence of a jury trial.
