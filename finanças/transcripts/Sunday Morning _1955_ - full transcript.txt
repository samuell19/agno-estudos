ONE SUNDAY MORNING Written and directed by Cinematography Music Narration Sound Editing Production Manager Assistants Production: The Documentary Film Studio Distribution: Central Film Exchange It is an exceptionally beautiful Sunday. They must stay on duty so that we may take our Sunday ride to the park. This lady did not return my smile... To have your own bus... Wouldn't that be just perfect? Is it raining? No, it's simply a wet job, a morning shower so to speak... Immaculate busses leave the depot. Needless to say, they come back looking quite different. But we all know that, it's just a matter of division of labour. Where is bus 133 going? Patience, please. We will find out shortly. It's that young driver we have met before. And, who is that young lady we have also seen briefly? Judging by their agitated conversation, she is not too overjoyed to be sharing one bus with him... One can have a lie-in on a Sunday, and then drop by a cafe where at this time of the day there's always a free table and pleasant atmosphere. See? The bicycle is a comfortable means of transport. A seat is guaranteed. Almost like on a bus - as long as you get on at the first stop and early in the morning... This young man visibly cannot bear to see a woman bored in his company... While this young man cannot bear to see a woman have fun in the company of another... Two men, one lady and a bus... Weary of their laughter, the driver is hurtling through the streets only shorten this passenger's journey as much as possible. Excuse me, sir... Watch what you're doing. Standing in the door is not allowed. There's no need to get upset... You may have noticed that I've been silent for a while. But I can't keep silent any longer. I must applaud the driver's approach towards a certain lady of a certain age... What wouldn't one do for a smile like this one? In round one of smiles, I think we can call it a draw. Oh, well. Such are the laws of the bus. Ladies get off while drivers stay. Drivers and old gentlemen, that is. It is our honour to present the so-called forgetful female. We all know that feeling when we read the newspaper and someone looks over our shoulder. This trick is as long as the hills. It has become a Warsaw tradition to check the progress on the Culture Palace. Tall, isn't it? Bus conductor? So, what next? A brief consultation and the young passengers are losing their cool. The next chapter's title, "Bespectacled Lady in Search of a Ticket". She did have one! We all saw it! There's the apple. There's the thread. There's the Great Theatre. And there's the ticket! What would a lady do without a conductor? She's not there. That's not her, nor that one. She's not there. The driver unravels his heart's secrets to us. The penny has dropped... He simply doesn't want the passengers to fancy her. Why do your lips... and nose? It's a draw, again. Here he is again! Is she really not there? No, she isn't. One man is stuck up there and another down here. The latter, because of a woman. No, that's not her. She is only 37 minutes late. He should be here. Oh, isn't he? Half an hour here or there... Dogs are very fond of columns. Even a dog may play a decisive role in a woman's life. They haven't seen each other for ages! Since last night. These are very important matters... Now, now. Get on. Finally they've found the perfect place for a chat. To get on the bus is a hanging matter for some. And the ladies are still at it. If you want to get on you'd better run. Let me kiss your hand, madam. Too many of us fancy the bus. How are we going to get on, sir? Where there's a will there's a way. SEAT FOR MO THER WI TH CHILD But this is a father with a child. And the sign says clearly - seat reserved for mothers with children. A so-called formalist. What does she care? Finally, she graciously obliged. Those two haven't had enough yet. She's probably telling her the clothes shop will be closed down. What stamina! See you, darling. Have you noticed the smiles? Unfortunately, they're the glass and speed isolates them. Watch out! Now, the tram is going too fast. A huge dilemma: To help or not to help? For sure it is a young scientist. A road to a diploma is a winding one. Like all the roads in Warsaw. All is well what ends well. There was no need to get upset. Slow down at the corner, would you? I've got a life and death situation here. He most certainly has. He has to take a close look at a certain lady. See how nice and polite our conductor is? True. Is it all right now? This is the end the line, the end of misunderstandings... and the end of our short story... What about? Nothing in particular. Nothing you wouldn't already know and see everyday. Just look at these young people. Did you have good time with them? I guess so. But they are really young and it seems they are a bit tired with us. We are going to meet them again anyway. THE END
