-The Momochi castle still stands. Lord Oda's patience is wearing thin. You will have to do something, Shogun. Momochi is no raw recruit. His ninja are the best there are. -Henshin! We're meeting like this in secret because I have a special mission for you. Kill Momochi! The three of us can achieve anything. I raised to myself. I have taught them to have no fear. Chin is a mute, Hario is deaf, together we make an unbeatable team. -Good Now do it! -My Lord, we do have other weapons and techniques available to us. We don't have to fight with muskets and swords. -The world will live in fear when they learn how Shogun, the chief of the Koga Ninja has struck him down. -I'm not ready yet for the fame I may earn, so I'll work in secret. That way, I can serve you more effectively. NARRATOR: On March 15th Lord Oda ordered Hideyoshi to storm the Momochi Castle in Iga Province, and destroy the Iga Ninjas down to every last man. So massive was the army, it exceeded the entire population of Iga province. Lord Oda was determined to eliminate this thorn from his side completely. So intent was he on revenge, he wanted nothing less than total annihilation. -Shogun, I am in your debt. Nothing gives me greater satisfaction than to hear --[LAUGH] Lord Sendayu, I can see his startled face even now in my mind's eye. [LAUGHS] My lord, let's plan our campaign. [GROANS IN PAIN] You traitor! Shogun, you deceive me! -Who are you're calling a traitor? You lost because your arrogance betrayed you. You know us ninja. [LAUGHS] -Damn you! [GIVES BATTLE CRY] -What's that? -It's the lord! -It's the lord! -It looks like he's been killed. Hey, look! -Huh? -Ninjas! [SPEAKING JAPANESE] -Brother, I can't find the sword. -What's that? The sword has a map which shows where their gold mine is. He must have it somewhere. Search again. -Sir. -Sir. [FLUTE PLAYS] -My lady, the castle has fallen. Our master has been killed-- [CHILD CRIES] -By the chief of the Koga Ninja. Shogun violently betrayed your husband. -Betrayed us? -Yes. He told the lord he was siding with us, but then he attacked him, from behind! -My husband would have been ashamed to die like that. This wolf proves that you are the heir. Guard it with your life, my child. Oroku, take care of my son. -You must leave with us, my lady. -Leave me. Now go! Mother! -No! Takamaro, sometimes it's harder to keep living than to die. But you must live, your defend your parents death. The family name rests in you. OKARU: Come back boy! -Mother! -Quickly boy, come quickly. -Damn it, we're too late. -I want that boy killed. Kanazuki, see to it. I want the Momochi Clan annihilated, down to every man, woman, and child. Yes. -Kill, or be killed. No quarter can be given in war. There's no other way. -Oh, Yatoshi? YATOSHI: Yes, father. -Oh, you're alive. -Thank good you're safe. I was beginning to give up hope. -Here comes the boy, come here. Give him to us. [LAUGHS] [CHILD CRIES] -Don't cry, Oto. -Get down. Quickly! Quickly, run for your lives. CHILD:Mommy, mommy, mommy! Damn it! Kill them! Kill all of them. -Show them no mercy! NARRATOR: In June of the following year 1582, General Akichi turned against his own master, Lord Oda. Shogun had informed Hideyoshi of Akichi's intended treason. So, as Lord Oda died, Hideyoshi was ready to take power for himself, and become the effective ruler of Japan. Hideyoshi then announced he would avenge Lord Oda's death, and defeated General Akichi at the Battle of Yamazaki. -Betrayed. Doomed. NARRATOR: General Akichi never realized how he had been used. In this way did Hideyoshi unify the country, and turn the Japanese into one nation. [SINGING IN JAPANESE] -It's land. Japan! NARRATOR: Wanted, Ishikawa Goemon the Phantom Thief, for a multitude of crimes. Five ounces of gold as reward for information leading to his arrest. Ten ounces of gold to whoever brings him alive. -Aw, I could do with money like that. -Aw, what do you mean? It isn't as if Goemon steals from us, than is it? When hasn't he split his loot with us poor people. -Come along, come along, come along! Feast your eyes on this monkey, a most amazing little creature! -Hey, what's so special about him then? -Don't worry- -What's he do? -Let's see him do something! -Come on. [CROWD CHEERS] -See our lovely young girls perform their dancing. You've come to the right place, young man. Walk right in. The Otsuya troop are famed for their Kabuki. Hey, stranger! You come from China, don't you? You've seen nothing like this back home. Another customer. CROWD: [MUMMERS APPROVINGLY] MALE SPEAKER: Take it off! Take them off! Come on! Take them off! Come over here. Come on! CROWD: [ANGRY SHOUTING] Stop that! -What's going on? Oh, no, let go! Let go of me! Stop! [BONES SNAP] -Ow! My arm. No more! Ow, ow, oh. [BONES STOP] MALE SPEAKER: Come on, stop it! -Oh, my arm! MALE SPEAKER: Come on, get him! Hey, why you-- [WOMEN SCREAM] -Get out of the way! Come on, get out the way. Hey, there's going to be trouble. Hey, hey, come on. -Hey, let me through. Hey, what the hell's going on? -Hey, that guy there! -[YELLS] -Hey, look at this! Hey, come on! [CROWD SHOUTING] -Uh? -Hey, you see that? -The Momochi sword! -Come on! MALE SPEAKER: Watch out, here's the police. MALE SPEAKER: Make way for the police! Out the way there. Get back! Get out of there. Don't let the foreigner escape. Arrest him! -Chase him! MALE SPEAKER: Chase him! After him! Don't let him escape! Get after him! Surround the building! Ichi, come on. NARRATOR: This particular ninja was working as a spy for Lord Tokugawa, who plotted to usurp Hideyoshi's position as shogun. [LAUGHS] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] [ALL LAUGH AND CHEER] -You're back! Master Takamaru. -We managed the float out to sea. Luckily, a Chinese merchant ship spotted us and took us to China. -Oh, that was lucky. -How's Iroko? -He's dead. Seven years ago. -Tell me, is Hatsu safe? -We got separated from Hatsu. We don't know what happened to the poor girl. We haven't seen her since. -I see. -By the way, we have enough gold stored to call the clan together again. MOMOCHI TAKAMURA: Then why live in this old ruin? -This ruin is our camouflage. -You must have heard of people talking of Ishikawa Goemon who robs from the rich and gives to the poor. -Right, it's right. It's not you? -We're no ordinary criminals. -Our mission is to overthrow the Hideyoshi government. [LAUGHS] -We're so generous to the poor, they all help us. They're our private army. -Ishima's information and explosives. I'm in charge of planning, and Utsuke isn't the brightest, but he can open any lock in Japan. -Who says, I'm stupid? I can fight. -Utsuke is as light and as fit as a monkey. -I help out in odd jobs, though, if any animal needs handling, than I am the man. -They seem to respond to him. I don't know what it is, because we're all animals. ALL: Ishikawa Goemon! -So you see, it's not just one of us, it's all of us. -Is that a fact? -Come and have a look through here. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] This is just part of our property. -Oh, I-- -I remember you. Ishima! -Ishima! This is our young master, Takamru. He's come back to us from China. -So why doesn't he go back there then? He looks as if he'd be more at home there in that strange outfit. -Ishima, you're out of line. -If you don't like what I say, than step outside and I'll show you how to fight. -Hey, hold on! -All right, I'll go. -Come on! And I'll demonstrate how to use Jujitsu! -Hey. You win, master. [CHEERS] ALL: [CHEER] -Yashima's good, but he's no match for the young master, he's brilliant. -Huh, you reckon he's good enough to beat me? -Go home! -What's this? -Huh, someone left this at the temple as an offering. -What do you mean, you stole it? -Hey, up there! -Huh? -Huh? -Welcome, Takamaru! -Natoshi! -[LAUGHS] Hey! I've trained these ninja to act like spiders. As loyal Momochi, we're at your disposal. -I, Takamaru, [INAUDIBLE] behalf of the Momochi Clan, will kill Shogun and charge Hideyoshi. The Momochi clan will rise again! -Shogun! -Yes? -How is it you have caught that thief called [INAUDIBLE] yet? People will start losing their fear of you. After all, the is my home town, so to speak. -Forgive my failure, my lord. I will get him for you. --[LAUGHS] That's what I like to hear. But you are my military advisors, arresting criminals should be your brothers job. After all, he's been appointed magistrate. -I'll tell him of your concern. I'm sure he can solve this problem. -Shogun, look! -Sir! -Our army is victorious! Nothing can stand in their way. Soon, all Korea will be our. General Korodo and Chimiso are here. Geteral Kato is holding the northern flank. In fact, our armies are doing so well over there, I was thinking of possibly invading China too. -Congratulations, sir. -War is so expensive, and I'm running out of gold. -I see. -Shogun, do you remember the Momochi Clan, whom I had annihilated? -Yes, I do. Even now I'm hunting down survivors. Your orders were to destroy all of them. -If only I could find out where they have their secret gold mine. I could be enjoying this war so much more, and I do enjoy it so much when our side is winning. Oh, Sutemaru [LAUGHS] my son, come here! Sutamaru, how are you today, eh? That's a good boy. Hey, come to see your father? LADY YODO: That's enough. -Eh? -You'll spoil him. Come along, Sutamaru, come. Sutamaru. --[LAUGHS] If a man's not king in his own house, how is he able the rule a whole people? -Silence! I'm in charge of this country! -Yatoshi, I'm sorry. I'd hoped your father would live. We could come back together. -I'll bury this keepsake of his somewhere. We are worse than outlaws. We have no land to call our own. Young master, restore the Momochi clan. With you, we are ready to rise up. None of us have forgotten what they did! -I'll try. I won't let you down. I intend to fight to the death, until our clan is powerful again. -What did you do in China? Was my father able to help you? -He died when I was 14. One day, when I'd run out of money, I was caught stealing food. Could have been very bad, but luckily I got away. -Are you all right? -Come here, damn you! MOMOCHI TAKAMURA: She's the daughter of a Kung-Fu instructor. Her name was Ai-Lian, and I loved her. I still miss her. -Brother Hansu! Welcome home. -It's for you. Open it. -Thank you, brother. Oh! It's lovely. It's beautiful. Look! BROTHER HANSU: It suits you. -Really? BROTHER HANSU: Makes you look like a lady. [CHUCKLES] -You're joking. [CHUCKLES] So, you must be hungry. I'll get a meal ready. -Hatsu. -Hm? -Sit down. -Yes, brother? -Takamaru Momochi's turned up in Kyoto. He's a strong young men, now. -Really? Brother, I'm no longer part of the Momochi clan. This is my home. You brought me up here, and I'm your sister now. -That's right. So, you could do me a favor. See Takamaru. Take his sword away from him. It's got the secret of the Momochi gold mine written on the blade. -Master, as long as you have the sword, our clan will never be short of funds. -What do you mean? What about the sword? -On the blade, it is written the secret map of the Momochi gold mine. My father told me as the castle is being attacked, carry it with you always, never lose it. -There's only half. Where's the other half? [FLUTE PLAYS] -Hatsu. Hatsu! -Takamaru. -So you are alive. -This flute has brought us together. -I remember, my mother's keepsake. Crybaby Hatsu. -I've not wept a single tear since that day. -My mother and my father, the flute and sword remind me to avenge them. Hatsu, all our friends are still alive. I met them soon after I got back here. I'm sure they'll be pleased to see you. -Another time. -Oh. Hatsu, where are you living now? -A kind man took me into his home in Osaka. -Well, that's fortunate. Yatoshi's with us, too. Let's go. -Good night. -Are you sharpening it to take revenge? -What do you mean? -I took the reward. I talked to the police about you and Takamaru. I told them where to find them. -What's that? -You're safe. You're safe with him. I didn't mention you. -Otsuya! -Go! Go ahead, kill me if you want to. I deserve to die, go ahead! [SOBS] No! No! No! Don't! Kill me if you want,. but don't go! No! -Let me go! -Oh no! -How can I betray my own friends? -It's too late! Please! Do you want your child to be fatherless? Get it? -Huh? -Yes. Feel this. It's ours, this baby growing inside me. Please, don't go! You mustn't go. You musn't go! You musn't go! Don't go! [CHICKEN CLUCKS] -Huh? -Huh? -It's a dead cock! -Take that! -Get back! -[YELLS] After him! -[YELLS] -Shoot them out of the trees! Yashima! -Huh, what? -Damn it! -Leave them. -Shogun! You are Shogun! -So, the Momochi son. You have survived this far. [LAUGHS] I don't want to kill you too soon, so hand over the sword. -Takamaru! -Otso! Run for it! -Talk! Where's the gold mine hidden? What's the secret? What's written on the sword? -TORTURER: Come on, Speak! -Damn it! How come they found us? [INAUDIBLE] Kazuki. -Right, 'cause that's why he come back here. -Quiet! -[GROANS IN PAIN] -Enough. -It does show the gold mine, but there is only half. There must be another sword somewhere that matches this. -Who has got it? -Hatsu, give me the flute. -Brother? -You have grown up with it, it's part of you, I know. But, as you're playing it, you relive your times with the Momochi. But remember, love is the strongest weapon you have. -Love is my weapon. -And don't forget you're my sister. [GASPS FOR AIR] [BONES SNAP] -Who are you? I am Takamaru Momochi! [YELLING IN JAPANESE] MALE SPEAKER: Prisoner escape! NARRATOR: The bandit Ishikawa Goemon will be boiled alive, in a cauldron on the 23rd of the month, down by the riverbed. [CROWD MURMERS] -No! No! -No! Not that! No! No! No! No! No! MALE SPEAKER: Get back! -Let me through. Out of my way! Let me go! Let me through here! MALE SPEAKER: Stop that man! -Let me through! Let me go! Out of my way. MALE SPEAKER: Stop that man! -Get out of my way. Let me go! -No! No! -I am Ishikawa Goemon! Listen everyone! You've got the wrong people! I'm your man! I can't let someone else take my place! I can't let innocent people die! -Kazuki! -Kazuki! -Kazuki! Kazuki! -Kazuki! -Stop her! -Sakayuki! MALE SPEAKER: Hey, look quickly. -Don't move! Get down! I want to check you! Heads up! -Come here! -No! No! No! No! No! No! -No! No, no! No! No, please! [SCREAMS] -Takamaru! Takamaru! [CROWD SCREAMS] -Hey, come on, quickly! Get away! Run away from here! Run away! [GUNS FIRE] -Look there! It's Takamaru! -Here we go. Follow me. -Right. -Yatoshi! -Yatoshi! -Young master, get away! -Hey, get back! -Yatoshi! -Young master, get back, get back there, quickly! Young master you fool, you must stay alive for me. Stay back here! [YELLING IN JAPANESE] BOTH: Yatoshi! [GUN FIRE] [CROWD SCREAMS[ -Don't die! No! -Damn you, Hanzo. [CROWD YELLS ANGRILY] -Quickly, let's go. Come on! MALE SPEAKER: Make way. [GUN SHOTS] -Leave me! Get away from-- -No! -Come on No! -Fushiki! -Leave him. -Leave him! [CRICKETS CHIRP] [YELL REVERBERATES] [FLUTE PLAYS] [SOBS] We're the only survivors. -I lost. I was defeated. -Look! Somebody's there! -Huh? -Huh? -You aren't beaten, Takamaru. But you will be unless you pull yourself together. -Do you know me? -Of course, I do. The sword is proof of who you really are. -I know you. -Sazawa Hakamusi. -Hakamusi? -I will beat any defeatism there is out of you. Come! [SINGING IN JAPANESE] [YELLING] -Konichiro! Konichiro! KONICHIRO: Help me! -Be careful! -Konichiro! -Stop. Let him crawl back by himself. -But he can't. You can't-- -He's a fool. You have to learn in this world you can't trust anybody. A lioness is meant to deliberately put her cubs away, and only the ones that can find their own way back to her will become adults. -Yes, master. [SHIRINUI KIAIS] SAZAWA HAKAMUSI: Oh, well done. Fool. Is this can in reality been a sword your hand would have been severed right from your body. Takamaru, if you wear blades on your arms than you could use your arms like swords, and you could move much faster. -Kowochiro? -Kowochiro! -You're alive! -You're alive! [LAUGHS] -I made it. -You made it! -You made it! -I made it. -We're together. -You've been through a tough training. You have mastered it all, the secret arts of the Iga Ninja. However, three is something else before you can take revenge. -What is it? We're ready to learn. -Later. This swords was given to me to keep in trust by your father, now it's yours. You've heard of the Momochi gold mine, the map of its whereabouts has been engraved on both swords. Only if you have both of them can you find the exact location of the mine. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] -Hatsu, tell me, why did you steal it? -Takamaru, please don't ask me. -Hatsu. Hatsu! Hatsu, you must tell me. Hatsu, I have to know. How could you do this? -Takamaru, please don't make answer. Go ahead, kill me for the traitor I am, please. I've betrayed our clan, but I'm bound to another loyalty as well, to my foster brother, Hatori Hanzo. -Hanzo? Did he tell you to steal it? -I can't stand much more of this? Why don't you finish me off, Takamaru? [LIGHTNING STRIKES] -Hatsu, go back to him. If he wants it, he can come himself! -Why don't you do as the girl says? She's admitted she works for Hanzo. Kill her. -Takamaru, go and kill me! -Right, he won't. I will. I'll do it! -Hatsu, run! -Stop it. Out of my way. -Run! -Takamaru! Run! -Well done, Takamaru. Remember, you can use both your arms, so you can fight with two swords. You'll be a mighty warrior, remarkable. -Master! -Stay back! Takamaru, you still lack one vital ingredient. Your heart needs to be made of sterner stuff. If you're to overcome your enemy you must learn to concentrate your anger and hate. Show no mercy. Used our emotions like a coiled spring, just as a wild beast. -Like a wild beast. -Behold! The gods sent down their thunderbolts. Their lightning inflames the earth with fear. Takamaru, there's no turning back for you. You're now lord of the Momochi clan to the end! -Master! -I'll say goodbye. -Why can't you? Why can't you do it? Have you forgotten the code of the ninja you swore. -Hanzo, please help Takamaru! He needs no help now that he's got both swords to fight with. -Takamaru isn't interested in power or wealth. He only wants to kill his archenemy, Shogun. It's the only reason he's returned to Japan! I beg you, you have to help him! -I love him! I love him with all my heart! --[ROARS] Hatsu, is life so precious to you? -It is. I want to live. -Even I, the most powerful man in all Japan have no defense against disease. --[CHUCKLES] You're not done for yet, my lord. [CHUCKLES] -I-- Shogun, come closer. Leave me. -Sir. -[GROANS] No, let the child be. I may be the ruler here, but after I'm gone, what power shall I have? I must see my son, Sutamaru, succeed me. Shogun, I'm none too confident of Ieyasu. He plots and he conceals his hand. I can't be sure whether he is in Echizen province or he's staying with his son, Hidiyoshu-- -Sir, what do you want me to do? -(STRAINING TO SPEAK) You are to deliver this letter to Ieyasu himself personally. -Yes, sir. Am I to wait for his reply? -Of course. Understand? If we let this chance slip from our hands, our clan's finished. So we have got no alternative, but act now. -Yes. On one condition. If I succeed, appoint me to be the boy's guardian. -Appoint you? -Yes, sir, appoint me the boy's guardian. I gather that Lord Maida is expecting the post. -Lord Maida? -Yes, it's dangerous post. These times are fraught with peril. Your son has many enemies. I have worked hard for you, all my life. My lord, I am uniquely placed to perform this important role on your behalf. I'll guard his life as if it were my own. I ask nothing else. -What's this? I hope you are mad with pity. [COUGHING FIT] -Is it such a big thing to ask? --[COUGHING FIT] All right, but I want you to deliver Ieyasu's reply in person. I will be awaiting your return. MALE SPEAKER: General, Shogun is leaving. Call out the palace guard. -Shogun! Shogun, it's this way. --[LAUGHS] Master Satamaru, you keep a close eye on the lord. -Right. -[LAUGHS] -Hatsu, Shogun is leaving Kyoto. It's a perfect opportunity. Tell Takamaru. He's leaving the Fushima Castle on the 17th of the month. Here's a map of the route he'll take to Echizen. Deliver it. -Brother. -Ai-Lin! -I've been waiting for you. -Ai-Lin, why haven't you gone back home? -Everywhere's my home. My home is wherever my love is. I want to fight with you by your side. I can't live without you. Please? HATSU: Shogun leaves Kyoto on the 17th. He'll be taking the Nagasendo highway, through the Wakihuru pass, on his way to Echizen. Takamura, here's the chance you've wanted. Don't miss it, you may never get another. -Hmph, how can we believe ninja Hanzo's woman. -I mean business! Well, what I'm wondering is, what's in it for you? -Takamaru, you have to trust me. -Well, I trust her. Taka, I do trust her. It's worth taking the risk, isn't it? -All right, yes. -I've all ready sworn to fight him to the death, nothing's going to stop me. We'll fight like animals. We'll take him at Washaki Mountain. The road's steep there, his men will be tired. It's two days from Kyoto, he's cut off from supplies, and the forest either side affords good protection. -Are they flying squirrels, I wonder, or Momochi we've missed. -Brother, ignore them. Let's keep going, out business is ahead. -Halt the column. We can't afford to lose our men. Get off the road. -Welcome, Shogun! Here I am, the lord of the Momochi clan. You die. -Archers, shoot him! SHIRANUI SHOGUN: Shoot him down. Fire at will. Shoot him! What are you waiting for? Out of the way. Musketeers, load up and fire. -Sir! -Damn him. They're our own men. SHIRANUI SHOGUN: Fire! SHIRANUI SHOGUN: Hold it, don't fire at random. That's what they want us to do. Kanazuki? -Sir? -Split up into 6 squads. -Yes, sir. -And each squad just hunt down one man. Beyond the forest there are some dunes and swamps. Drive them out towards the open, where we'll cut them down. We can rejoin the road further up, and don't give them the chance to get around us. Go! -Sir! -Sir! -Any sign of them? SOLDIER 2: Not yet, sir. SOLDIER 1: Spread out. SOLDIER 2: Over this way. Pick up your boots. Over here! [INAUDIBLE] -What's going on? -We've done it! We've done it! -Damn you, Takamaru. -Spread out! -Oi! MALE SPEAKER: [SCREAMS] -Get her! [SOLDIERS SCREAM IN PAIN] Quick -Come on! Come on! Follow me! Come on! [YELL OF SURPRISE] -You can't catch me. You're all going to die. You can't catch me! [GROANS IN PAIN] -No No, you musn't die! SOLDIER: [GIVES BATTLE CRY] -Come on! -Get in there! SHIRANUI SHOGUN: Gunners! Gunners. Fire. KONICHIRO: Takamura, come on! -Konichiro! -Oh -Hanzo. -Brother! -Shogun, your days as Hideyoshi's dog are over. --[CHUCKLES] If my time has come, you can be sure death has marked you. -You have let power go to you head, Shogun. You no longer recognize your own weakness, that's where you've failed. You're doomed. --[LAUGHS] You have no idea what real power can do. -[CRIES OUT IN PAIN] -Ai-Lian! Ai-Lian! Ai-Lian! Ai-Lian? -Taka, can I help you? I have helped you. Taka, remember. -Ai-Lian. -When first we met, all the peach blossom was in bloom. Taka, I love you, Taka. Gunner. -Ai-Lian? Ai-Lian! -Hey! MOMOCHI TAKAMURA: Shogun! -Go. I'll take care of them, go! -Hyah! -Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! -We've got him. -Hyah! Hyah! [HORSE WHINNIES] [GURGLES] NARRATOR: Almost at that same moment, Toyatomi Hideyoshi died at the ripe old age of 62. Japan was about to have a new shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, a ruler history would judge as the greatest of them all. HATORI HANZO: Give me the swords, hand them over. -I refuse. -Out of the way. [FLUTE PLAYS] [SINGING IN JAPANESE] -There is my answer. -Well, maybe it's for the good.
