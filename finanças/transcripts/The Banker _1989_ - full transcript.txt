Jane Marie Mallott. 2215 Franklin Terrace, Hollywood. Correct address? Take it in. What a life, huh, Vac? - Jesus, in my 18 years, I've never seen a slice up job like that. Nah, nah, she wasn't sliced, she was dissected. - All right, thanks Mike. Our pal knew precisely what he wanted to do. - Precisely? What do you mean? - This isn't just a murder, Kid, this is a work of art. Give me the key, I want to check out who that room was registered to, though it's likely to be a dead end. Then use some of that Latin charm you got on the maid, see what she's got to say. We get back to the office, we do a rundown on all murders over the last 15 years. All murders? - Make sure you cross-reference this guy's M.O. - Uh, excuse me, Sergeant Jefferson, could you tell us something about the murder? - It wasn't me. - Thanks, appreciate it. - Whoa. - Next time that cocksucker calls, let me know. News 41, after this, this channel continues now with the latest market information. The first new look at the numbers at this hour. - Good morning, Demetrius. - Good morning, sir. - One minute to air, everybody, one minute! - What's the verdict, Bruce? - Sharon. Sharon! The front office thinks your murder piece was terrific, but Terry's gonna do the story. - Listen, Frank, I know I can do this. - 30 seconds, Sharon. - No. - Fred, I was there, just give me the chance. - Terry's the star of the show. Lead with the murder case. - 15 seconds, people. And in five, four, three... - I'm Terry Moss, and this is KLA New News. The oasis of calm in Beverly Hills was shattered this morning, when the slashed body of a Hollywood woman, Jaynie Marie Mallott, 23, was found at the Beverly Regency Hotel early this morning. - What is she doing to my story? She can't even read it right. Later, Sharon, later! - No, Fred, wait! I saw what was done to that woman. - Was sentenced today to spend one month living in his own rat infested apartment building. On a lighter note, bringing us up to date on the latest KLA, Eye On Us Minute, is our own Sharon Maxwell. - Looking for something special? Something different? Well, I've got just the place for you. The Santa Monica Sandcastle Expo. There's sun, there's fun, there's... On a lighter note? Jesus. This story just doesn't seem important right now. A young woman lost her life this morning. She was savagely murdered in a hotel room, doesn't anybody care? Who was she? And who couldn't done such a thing to her? On a lighter note? Damn it, she deserves more than 30 seconds on the noon day news. Have we all become so callous and detached that we can just dismiss her like that? We are to blame! We trivialize what's... - Commercial, now. - And promote what's not, and it doesn't have to be that way! We all better wake up and do something about it. Cut! - We can make a difference! At American Airlines, we do this over 2,000 times a day. And we do it in over 200 cities throughout the U.S., Mexico, Europe, Canada, Hawaii, the Caribbean, and Japan. - What did you do? Tomorrow, 7:30 a.m., my office. You are out, finished. - All right. Thank you. Yes, we're moving into media in a very big way, and I want you to be apart of it. Yes, all right. No, the papers will be drawn up and delivered to you by tomorrow. Right. Thank you. Yeah. All right, my friend. Yeah, the next time I'm in New York, let's have dinner. Ciao. Buy him out. I want that television station by closet marker G. - Yes, sir. - Um, Mr. Osbourne. Three o'clock, the executive conference. - Oh, yeah. Thank you. - Uh, Dan? Do you mind me asking what happened with Ms. Maxwell back there? Well, listen, you were right. Room 313 at the Beverly Regency was registered to a Mr. Smith and he paid in cash and by mail ahead of time. So, can I get you anything, Dan? Maybe some coffee? Some coffee? - Yeah, sure Kid. - Cream, sugar? - Yeah. All right. Let's see what we have here. We got a big joint, the Beverly Regency. We got Jaynie, who, according to her rap sheet, ran it out at 500 an hour, and we've got some seriously weird Indian graffiti. - I think it's South America, Dan. - Yeah? I don't know. Anyway, my little voice tells me this guy is not just about doing call girls. All right, Kid. We start with a check of the hotel staff, then we move onto that South American angle, see what happens. - Here's your coffee, Dan. - What? - Your coffee. - I never touch the stuff. - Hello, babies. Dan Jefferson, L.A. Sheriff. Don't move. You've no doubt heard through your manager that there's one sick son of a bitch out there. If any of the boys start taking it in to some real serious events, won't you give me a call. Here, either one of those numbers. Day or night. - You mean, you're not gonna bust me? - Nah. Good, huh? - Sharon. Sharon, are you ready for this? After you left yesterday, the switchboard lit up like a Christmas tree. Over a thousand calls came in, all backing you. - Good morning, Sharon. Listen, I was a little too hasty in my estimation. - So... I'm not fired? - Sharon, don't be silly. Think of the ratings. - Hey, wasn't that Dan "I'll never speak to him "as long as I live" Jefferson that I just saw on the head of the tape? - Yeah. You did well, Sharon Maxwell. Keep up the good work. - Nice, Fred. - Huh? Oh, yeah. - One last time, Ira. Cowboy. Oh shit. All right. Say hello to your mother for me, Ira, bye. West Hollywood, Kid. - Who was that, Dan? - My snitch. If I wasn't so lazy, I'd go kill the son of a bitch. - Oh, they got back to me with that computer check on all murders going back 15 years with the same M.O., and... - You got zip. - Yeah. How'd you know? - This guy's an original. - Who lives here? - Jaynie's love broker. Man, look at you. You got cop written all over your face. Loosen up a little bit. Starting tomorrow, get yourself some real clothes. - Hi guys. - I'll take that as an invite. - How old are you, sweetie? - 15. - 16, 17, now you're 18. - Hi, guy. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm her father. Nah, I'm only kidding, I'm a cop. And you, sweetie, are under arrest. Move. Get outta here! - Freeze! Now drop the God damn gun. - Go get it. - I got a much better idea. - Dave. I got a fish for you. - Can you get me the hell outta here man? I need you to get me out. - Well, we got a Cowboy. Must be Christmas. Could've canceled your ticket right there on the spot. You all right, Dan? - Yeah. - What's the charge, Dan? - Contempt of cop. - Oh. - I'll be out of here before you can kiss your mama, boy. - Twice. Put him where you want him, Dave. Be creative. - Turn around. Keep your legs out. - I don't know what happened, he just barged into the house. I'm in the bar, next thing I know, he's shooting at me, for crying out loud. Just make the call, and get me out. Do what I tell you to do, you get paid for it. You understand? - Yes. - Yeah, you got the 20 grand. Get the same again.

Um, yes, Sergeant Jefferson please. - Yeah, hold on. Sarge. - Jefferson. - Hi, Dan, it's Melanie. What's wrong? - Hi, well you told me to call if anything strange happened. Anyway, I'm at this place downtown, and there's this weird guy, he's got all these objects ar... - Melanie! Trace it. Melanie! Speak to me! - Thanks. They only got the prefix, Dan. It's somewhere downtown. Damn it! - Well, hi there. Did you have a good sleep? You feeling all right? Good. Who were you talking to on the telephone there before? That's all right, you don't have to tell me, I already know. His name is Dan Jefferson. Now then. Let's get down to business, shall we? - I don't know what you're talk... - Beneath your pillow is a knife. It is yours. If you make it out of the building, you live. - Why are you doing this to me? - Off to work we go, Melanie. - Help me! Somebody help me! Help me! Will somebody help me! Why are you doing this to me? You shouldn't have given me this knife. I know how to use it! - There's $10,000. It's only a game, Melanie. Part of the ritual. - A game? - Yes. And you are its most honored participant. - Sergeant Jefferson, can you tell us anything about the murder? - Jesus, Sharon, give me a break, will ya? Doc. Get your work done as quick as you can, I don't want these vultures getting what they came for. - Sure. - Well, well, guess who's here? - Yeah, I noticed. - Another cutie? - I knew her. - Sorry. Guess it's your day. - How's that? - That Cowboy shaman. Must've had one hell of a Christmas club. Just made bail about an hour ago. - Marvelous. What kind of animal could do that? - Is my call to Johannesburg ready yet? - Here, sir. I'll put it through right now. - Very dangerous animal, I should think. - Well, there's been a second murder. Apparently by the same killer, and from all your calls and letters, I know you want to get involved, and I need your help. - There you go. The victim's name is Melanie Van Dorne. - Hey, turn that up. Los Angeles. A young woman, 23 years of age. And like Jane Marie Mallott, also a call girl. - Watch this. - We need to hear from anybody who knew her or possibly last saw her. - I don't need this shit. - The only clue we have is some type of primitive symbol found etched in blood near both victims bodies. The only evidence the Sheriff's Department would make available to us was, "No comment at this time." All right, we know that there is some evidence the Sheriff's Department should not reveal to the public, and we respect that. But I am sure there is something, anything, that they could give us that would help us to help them apprehend this asshole. - Did she say asshole? - As long as she doesn't say fuck, we're fine. - But until he does, I think maybe the Sheriff's Department should rethink their policies of how much evidence they withhold from their public. What do you think? - Yeah. We'll be right back. - Turn yourself in, buddy, just like that. How you doing, Harry? - Hi. - What do you got? - Well, your victim died of a massive trauma to the left ventricle, caused by this. It's South American, Indian. - Yeah, Kid got that already. - Yeah, we don't know what tribe yet. The markings on this and the other arrow shaft match the symbols found scrawled on the walls at the scene of the crime. And this was found at the base of that very same ventricle. See the eyes, nose, mouth. - Yeah? Holy moly. Grover Cleveland. - Grover Cleveland? - Who's on the one dollar bill? - George Washington. - You bet. And who's on the thousand dollar bill? - Grover Cleveland? - No shit, Kid. You oughta run for governor. You know how touch it is to get a thousand dollar bill? 99% of the banks haven't got one. Our boy has big money. Big money. - Sharon, there's a call for you. - Thanks, Shirley. Sharon Maxwell. - You know, you're amazing, Sharon. - Well, thank you, I think. Is there something I can do for you? Oh, I was just thinking that in life as in business, only the strong survive. - Um, I beg your pardon? Is there something you need? Nothing. Just a thought.

Yeah. - There ain't no magic, Lloyd, and you know it. There's good, hard cop work. Eddie and I are out there busting our chops. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Meanwhile, the Mayor wants magic. And I want it stopped. - Time is up. - Gotcha. What's going on, Fred? - This is your lucky day, kiddo. After what happened yesterday, you are going on live at 6 and 11, you'll answer calls form the great masses, and you'll respond to each of them. Ta-da! - Are you kidding? I got a door. - And an office. Miss Maxwell's office. They found another one. - Lady, I am gonna make you into a household name. - This guy's pissing me off. - Hey, Danny. No arrow. - Dan, I did some checking on this symbol, and well, all of this, it's from some primitive tribe. It's the domination of women, the return of the hunter. It's a ritual of the blood. - All of that, huh? This is some weird shit, Kid. - Security. Intruder in Mr. Osbourne's office, hurry up. - Call security back. Tell him to forget it, I'll take care of him. - But Mr. Osbourne, he just barged in. - Renee, thank you. - And you have been a naughty, naughty boy, Mr. Osbourne. Now I admit, now I am a criminal, a deviant, and I do love to party, now that's a fact. But compared to you, Mister. I don't hold a candle compared to you, Mister. - Can I offer you anything? I don't believe I know your name. - Well, let's keep it that way. I'm a businessman. And you're a businessman. And I got the deal of the century for you. You give me say, 500 large, and I got amnesia, forget we ever met. That's both times we had the pleasure. - Now, you do realize of course, that if I were to call security right now and say that you threatened my life, they'd probably shoot you on the spot. - Oh, lordy. You know, you are breaking my heart. Now let's not make a career of this. Do we have a deal or does my buddy make a phone call to the boys? Buddy? - May I? Well, of course I may. Okie dokey, Big O. Now we have a deal, or what? - I would be very careful of what you ask for in this life, my friend. You might just get it. Mr. Roth. I'm sending down a gentleman with a cash receipt for $500,000. I'd like you to have it ready for him in 10 minutes, please. Yes. Thank you. Done. - There. You have a nice day. - Cheers. - And I'm sure killing these helpless young women makes you feel potent and all-powerful. Well, I want you to know what your public really thinks of you. I have a few letters here addressed to the murderer of Jane Marie Mallott, Melanie Van Dorne, and Stephanie Jameson. Whoever you are, you know I've been watching you. - This broad has got some balls. - To the serial killer. "I hope I serve on your jury, I wanna watch you fry." "Why waste time and money on a trial for this animal, "let's just hang him and be done with it." - Dan, you really know how to pick 'em. - "I would like to get to you before the cops do, "I'd cut off your..." Well, I'm sure you get the gist of it. - Who's running the store down there? Don't they know she's baiting this son of a bitch? - I hope I've made your day. This is Sharon Maxwell, thank you and good day. - Somebody better deal with it. - Sergeant Jefferson, I told you it's out of the question. Thanks, honey. Look, we've got a new owner. And as a matter of fact, his organization likes her frank journalism. They want me to encourage it. - Encourage it? Why don't you give this guy his own show? Let him do his killing on television. That way your ratings go right through the roof, you'd like that, wouldn't you? All I know is A, the constitution, B, the First Amendment, C, freedom of the press. Anything else you can keep. - People are dead. You're gonna dance around it with that noise? I want to talk to Sharon Maxwell, I want to clue her in. - All right, let me elaborate further for clarity. A, she's protected by that same First Amendment, B, I'm the guy that signs her paychecks, and C, she's not here. So if that's it, just give me a break, huh? I got a very important meeting. - Come on, Kid. Let's see how just isn't here she really is. Hi. - What a surprise. - Yeah. Sharon, we have to talk. - Oh, well, you want to talk. Wow, that's a new approach. - The things you're saying on television are way out of line. Trust me, Sharon. You have no idea... - Wait a minute, wait a minute Dan. What makes you think you can walk in here and tell me how to do my work? - Look, Sharon, I'm here... - No, no, Dan, you look. You're missing the point. As usual, missing what really matters. - You have to understand my point... - No, Dan, if it weren't for people like me, people who actually believe that there is some good left in us, in all of us... - Sharon, I want you to meet the new owner. - Lucky me, I found her. - Hey, Sharon, I'd like you to meet Spaulding Osbourne. Sharon Maxwell. - How do you do? - This is a great pleasure for me. I've always admired your work, I find it most stimulating. - Well, thank you. - Sergeant Jefferson. - How do you do? - Howdy. Yeah. - Well, would you care to see the studio? - Certainly. Hit the light, Kid. Why are we stopping her? Attitude adjustment. - Come on, give it a rest. Dan, please. What are you doing? - You're under arrest. - For what? - Lack of common sense, move over. - No! - Move over. Follow us, kid. - Wait, Dan, this is kidnapping. Do you realize that? I'm not going in there. - Wanna bet? - You gotta be kidding. Dan, why are you doing this to me? I'm not going in there. Dan, you're sick for this. You are the sickest son of a bitch I have ever met. You know, I really think you've lost all concept of reality. - Reality? I'm gonna show you some reality. This! This is what it's all about. - Get me out of here. Please. - Wait, wait, wait. Dan, timeout. Hello, young lady. We watch you all the time. - You're big around here. What have you got? - Well, hair samples on all three of our victims tell us that your pal is white male, between the ages of 35 and 50, and on one of the victims, Melanie Van Dorne, we found some paint. Its base is from a flower indigenous to just a few places in South America. It's my guess that he was probably into that pagan stuff. And he probably likes heavy metal. - Nice job. Thanks. Look here. I'm real sorry that I dragged you there. You are baiting this guy on television, you gotta stop. He's not gonna stop killing. The last thing you want is to get on his bad side. - I'm just doing my job. I'm a journalist. Besides, I'm protected by the First Amendment. - What amendment protected them? - Okay. - What? - Okay! Ah, still know how to show a girl a good time. - I try. - Are you hungry? - Yeah. Thank you. - Still trying to save the world, I see. - Uh, Dan, I think he's called me. - What? - And I think he sent me roses after each murder. - And where are these roses now? I threw them away. - You threw them away? Jesus Christ, Sharon... - Would you stop being a cop for one minute and listen to me? Dan, I think he's followed me and I'm really scared. - I don't doubt it. I wish I could tell you not to worry, but this guy's not gonna stop. - Oh, that's a big weight off my shoulders. - Yeah. Listen though. I'm gonna get this guy, and I'm gonna stop him. But you, Sharon, have got to work with me. In the meantime I'm gonna have a car camped out in front of your house. You won't even notice it, all right? - Okay. You know where I'm living now? - 6068 Formosa. Crosses Willaby. I gotta keep up on those things. I'm freezing, you want to get outta here? - Yeah, let's go. - Oh God, not that song. Don't do this to me, Dan. Come on. Turn it off, please. - I thought you liked that tune. - I like feeling numb. Boy, you're in trouble. I hate you. - I know. Can I kiss you? - Oh, don't do that. - I thought you liked it. - I did. - Yeah. - The machine will get it. - Good. - Hi, this is Sharon. I can't come to the phone right now. Oh, I gotta get it. So leave a message after the beep, and I'll call you back. Thanks, bye. Hello, hello, I'm here. I tried you at the office, they said you left a couple hours ago. Okay, this is just for you. The next one's got spurs and jingle, jangle, jingle. - Jesus, that was him. - That's right. Spurs that jingle, jangle, Lloyd. Gotta be Cowboy. Get some units over there right away. Yeah. Hang on, baby. - Mm, we're gonna have a good time tonight, baby. Oh, yeah. Uh huh. That's right. Bravo. - Oh fuck. - Stay here. - Not going alone. Oh my God. - What the... - Outside your cage, there's a single-action, laser sighted crossbow. It's yours. These are car keys. It's parked out behind the lion cages. - What's the catch? - Oh, I imagine getting there alive. I have one shot, you have one shot. - You're pulling my chain, right? - Interesting, isn't it? In the jungle, as in the business world, it always come down to this. Two men, two weapons, one comes out alive. I'll count to 50. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. - Come on, I... Seven. - I'll forget about everything. - Eight. Nine. 10. - I'll even give you back the money. Well then, fuck you, and fuck your mother! My turn, cocksucker. Woo! I gotcha. Yeah, woo! Shit. What? What the hell? - You wouldn't last five seconds in the jungle. - Oh come on, please. Just give me another chance. - Another chance? - Please? - Oh, all right. Quick, name the Seven Dwarves. - Uh... Sleepy, Doc, Sneezy, Snoopy, Snoopy! - Snoopy? - Yeah. - Wrong. - No! - DMV says the vehicle's registered to our pal Fowler over there. - And the french fry in the car is? - Francis Mulverdale, also known as Cowboy. - Outstanding. My vacation starts 5 p.m. on Friday, and I want to leave town on a clean slate. You're telling me the guy in the car is our man, huh? - You bet, Lloyd. 10-4, we got our man, case solved. - Liar. - Worth a shot. - Dan, Lieutenant Hughes. - What do you got, Kid? - I think it would be better if you came over here, sir. - Osbourne Inc. What do you got? - We got a lead, Lloyd. We got a solid, gold $2500 lead. - So much for my vacation. - Bag that. - Did you check both their badges and identification? All right! Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm Mr. Osbourne's executive assistant. How may I help you gentlemen? - A smile would be nice. I'm Sergeant Jefferson. This is Deputy Garcia, we'd like to ask you a few questions. - I'm sorry, Mr. Osbourne, they just... - It's all right, Renee. I'm Spaulding Osbourne. - We've met. - That's right, the television station. Make yourselves comfortable. - We're conducting a murder investigation, Mr. Osbourne. I wonder whether you can tell me where that came from? - From me, this is mine. Where did you find this? Nice collection you've got here. - Thank you. - That was found next to the remains of a charbroiled pimp. - Amazing. It's simply amazing where things turn up these days. You know, the last time I saw that lighter was two weeks ago, Friday, the Metropolitan Opera intermission, I went to light a cigar, gone. Thank you, Renee. Tell Donald that I'll be right there. - Evidence. Thanks for your time, Mr. Osbourne. We'll be in touch about your property. - Good day, gentlemen. - Let me ask you something, Dan. Do you have any idea who Spaulding Osbourne is? - Yeah. - No, no, let me tell you. I kiss the Commissioner's ass, the Commissioner kisses the Mayor's ass, the Mayor kisses the asses of the Osbournes of the world. Are you following my drift? - Sounds like an awful lot of brown nosing to me, Lloyd. - Don't wisecrack me. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you on animal detail? - 'Cause he did it. - Right. - Start with the fact that the guy spent his wonder years in the South American jungle. - What are you cracking for? A psycho discharge? Are you claiming that one of the most powerful bankers in this country is a mass murderer? - They're all bloodsuckers, Lloyd. This guy happens to be the real thing. - Get lost! - Come on in. - I did a records check on Osbourne like you asked, sir, and he's clean. Wait, then I did some more checking on my own. - What? - I kinda got this girlfriend who works down at FBI records and well, Osbourne's a financial genius. He's made some big deals, reaped some big profits. No record of any military service, but he's an expert in martial arts. And get this. Now, he spent a great deal of time in South America last year doing big game stuff. - Good. Yeah. Add that to the fact that article you're looking at reads like a Tarzan novel, you've go tone strange son of a bitch. - Let me tell you something, Dan. When you're a dealing with a guy like Osbourne, you gotta pay attention to the simple rule of facts, you know? Like hard evidence. This is awfully thin. Come on, why don't you go home, get a rest, get a grip! What, what, what? What are you still doing here? Don't you have some paperwork you could be doing, huh? - There comes a time when the public safety outweighs the public need to know. I believe we've reached that. Therefore, I shall no longer be commenting on the murders of those unfortunate women. We intend to fully cooperate with the authorities and turn over any and all information that may aid in their investigation. - What? - This is Sharon Maxwell, thank you. - Look. Unofficially, I'm not saying Dan is right, and I'm not saying he's wrong. But unofficially, maybe you better keep your mind open to all possibilities. Do you get my unofficial drift, Deputy? - Yes, sir. - Very good. - Good night, Val. Hello? Hi, Sharon. - Who is this? - It's your friend, who else would it be? - What do you want? - Oh, I was kinda hoping maybe we could get together sometime. You know, we tend to think alike. You're a reporter, it could be part of your job. Keep talking. - I was thinking maybe we could do it right, you know. A bottle of Dom Perignon, a little beluga caviar after that, who knows, huh? - Who do you think you are? Where the hell do you come off doing these horror shows on women who never did anything to you? - That's not very nice, Sharon. - What, mommy didn't give you enough attention? - Wow. You're really disappointing me, Sharon. - Get used to it. - Homicide, Deputy Garcia. - This is Sharon Maxwell, I need to speak with Sergeant Jefferson. Sarge left just a few moments ago, ma'am. - I'm in my car, and I'm going home. I need to speak to him, the killer just called me. - All right, hang on, I can get him over the radio. L.A. 23-11. L.A. 23-11, come in, Dan. L.A. 23-11, come in, Dan. Miss Maxwell, I can't reach him. Okay, you reside at 6048 North Formosa? - Yes, but... - Okay, hang on, the Sarge told me he's got a patrol car parked right down the street. Hang on. - Roses, mister, roses. - No, thanks. Fuck it. Osbourne, you're mine. - Officers down, 6000 Block, Formosa. Officers down, send help. Geez, send help. - Oh my God. - Eddie! He's in the house. Oh geez. You... All units in Sector 14, officers down, 6048 Formosa. Crosses Willaby. Advise extreme caution. - Call for medical! Hang on, Kid. - Dan? - Yeah. - It was Osbourne, Dan. He was too fast, I... - Save your breath, Kid. I'm gonna get him, I swear to God I'm gonna make him pay for this. - Oh, he's got Sharon. He said you got to come follow or she'll die. - Where? - We gotta go! - Wait. - I... - Where? Come on, Kid. - Corner Spring Lex. 12 midnight, alone, or he'll kill her. - Thanks, Kid. - Dan? - Yeah. - Don't call me Kid. My name's Eddie. Eddie Garcia. - All right, Eddie. Get him there, guys. Good luck, Kid. - Why are you doing this? Why, for God's sakes? You got all that money, all that power. - I do not belong to the small world of power or money. My domain exists beyond all of this. Down to all that you think of is life. Yours. - Can I tell you something personal? Eat it! - Yeah! Yeah! Osbourne, you there? Corner of Jay and Harrison, Warehouse District. On foot, and alone. - If Sharon even has a headache on account of you, I'm gonna tear your fuckin' lungs out. You have 11 minutes. - God damn it. You're late. - No shit. Osbourne. You there? Always. Now look behind you. Hang up the phone and head for the elevators. - Now that I've got you right where you want me... - No! - Just be quiet. - He's crazy. I know he's crazy, Baby. - We've gotta get out of here. I'm open to suggestions. Life and death are two aspects of the same thing, which is being. - Osbourne, you don't have a fucking chance of walking away from this one. Come and get me. - Gladly. First I'm gonna get you outta here. - Dan! Dan? Dan? - Osbourne. Sharon, move. Move out of the way, now. All right, Osbourne. If you're gonna shoot, shoot. - If you shoot, she dies. If you don't shoot, she still dies. - Ask me if I care. - Well, do you care? - It makes no difference to me. - Drop! Is he dead? - If he ain't dead, I'll be God damned. - I... Am the hunter. I have collected the souls. I have lived in the shadows of sacrifice. You are worthy of my spirit, my immortality. I am Magroc! - Well, I'm Dan, I'm a cop, and you're fucked. - You are worthy. - What do you think the chances are of getting Jasper back from your mother? - Excellent.
