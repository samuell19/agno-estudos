PRISONERS OF THE EARTH Script by ULISES PETIT DE MURAT and DARIO QUIROGA Based on characters from the short stories: "Una bofetada", "Un peón" and "Los destiladores de naranjas" by HORACIO QUIROGA The province of MISIONES: a stunning patch of Argentina with its magical charm, dense, endless jungle and deep rivers in the far north of the country. There the call to PEACE and WORK resonates ever louder. It hasn't always been this way. Many years ago, men marked by destiny took the crisscrossed red jungle trails, hacked open by machete, to the very heart of the jungle in epic tales of blood and alcohol. Our story takes place in those turbid and strange times. THE YEAR 1915 Will you come back? Will you come back? I hope so. Let's get to the party, my friend! Coming? Of course! Goodbye beautiful! It's good news about the distillery. My left ear is ringing! It's a good sign! THE SUFFERING OF THE MENSÚ If I could pay back the money, I wouldn't go my friends, my father... You spent all the advance, and now you don't want to come! He's a brave man! My father is sick, he can't move, friends! He's crippled! I'm not going! Why don't you tell Köhner about it? Maybe you'll melt his heart! I was drunk when they made me sign! It's not right! My old man will be very lonely. Run, if you can! I don't want to go! I won't go! They're blocking your way. - Let me leave! - Get back! Sir! Please! I'll pay you back your money! My father! What would you pay back, wretch? Take him to the boat! No! I don't want to go! - Are you coming with me? - That's right, boss. Very good. Get on board, then. - Sign, friend, sign! - I don't want to sign! What's this? He doesn't want to sign. You had better sign! He can't read or write, boss. You were paid 200 pesos, weren't you? Here's 100 more. LA BAIADA - 100 PESOS This way, you can buy something when you get there. - And now, sign! - Give me your hand. Stop the shouting and the music! It's time to get on board. Didn't you hear me tell you to stop? It's over! Come on, it's time to get on board. - What's wrong, Andrea? - Papa, he's still not here! Don't worry. We won't leave without Dr. Else. Köhner, I want to thank you for what you are doing for Papa. I couldn't see you ruin your eyes and hands sewing. Oh, it's not so bad. Don't deny it, Andrea. You were working day and night to help him. If that was the only reason you did it... Oh no, no, Andrea. I really need him. The sickness is decimating the Mensús on the plantation. I'm sorry, my friend. It's nothing! It doesn't matter, it isn't broken! The best cane in the world! Try it, Köhner my friend! Have you got money, friend? Of course I have! Leave your weapons here. ...ask your friends for a drink! The farewell! I won't drink from now on. Are you coming to the plantation too? Yes. That's not a good idea. It's dangerous! - There are a lot of sick people. - That doesn't matter. Let's go, Papa. Leave your weapons here! - What are you doing? - What you see, boss. Eh, be careful with books! They unsettle your head. Careful, Podeley, that Köhner is terrible! Last night I dreamt of a cat. It means betrayal! Damn that gingo! He doesn't like people reading, that way he can rob them blind, in the bars, the markets, then, with the shopkeeps, he can charge them 10 pesos for a shirt that costs 2. That's why I work on plantations as a free man. You were too. Remember when I went treasure hunting, and we dug that tunnel in the San Ignacio ruins? That only you and I know about. We didn't find anything, brother, but the hideaway's still there! One day we may need it. - For what? - For nothing. Like two logs on the fire, we sing together And with our guitar, we spread happiness to all Watch that one! He's going to jump overboard! Stop this! Stop it! So it's you! I don't like it when people cut across my path. That's what you deserve! Tie him to the pole! - Is that dog yours? - Yes sir. Here. Give him something to eat, he's very thin. How beastly! You are still tied up! Beating you wasn't enough! I've been here all day. - I'm going to untie you. - No! It will be worse after. - Are you thirsty? - No... Yes! I'll bring you some water. Come in. It's very bad. It hardly plays now. But it still plays the melodies that my father loved so much. When I hear it, I feel like his music carries me away from here, to my father's homeland. He worked his fingers to the bone to be able return home. A bite from a coral snake sent him into the unending night. Andrea, I... - Were you looking for something? - Yes, the glasses. - Are there any? - I'll get one. No, thank you, I'll use my own. I took a long time, didn't I? - Here. - Let me see. Chinita. If I had known the water was for him, I'd have saved you the trip. Come and untie him. Well, you're free now. Free... Those men are very sick! I looked under "S": Scurvy - the symptoms fit! Unfortunately, I also looked under "D": Diphtheria. And the symptoms also fit! Let's go and see Dr. Else. Coming! Right away! Come in, come in. I need you, Dr. Else. Some of the Mensús are sick. The Mensús... How the times change! Do you remember, of the 300 taken from Villarica for the Tormenta plantations, Brazil? Only 20 returned. The Mensús die! Before, no-one bothered with such details. Those men cost money. They're here to fill the gaps the sickness has left. I pay you for that, not to be sentimental. Come on. I think these men are the same as those on the plantation. I'm going to prepare something for them to take. Take a torch and show him to the medicine cabin. Thank goodness we got away from those savages. Awful people. It looks like those men are still sick. They treat us like animals. They take the fruits of the earth and oppress the natives. They say ghosts lead to treasure. If we find one, we'll go south, far away, where the laws of land and men are more humane. Give half a mug to each one. The night is beautiful! What a pity it carries us to hell. - Why didn't you stay in Posadas? - I want to help Papa. I only wish he could return to how he once was. What a great man he was when he arrived. How wise! And now... There's Anthrax on the plantation. Yes, that's why Papa's here. I'm here because Köhner promised to help build my factory in San Ignacio. - Oh yes? - Why do you laugh? I remember when you wanted to distil bitter oranges. Chinita, don't tease! This time my inventions won't fail! I was looking through "A" in the encyclopaedia, and I found "alcohol". What? Don't you like it? - No. - Why? Alcohol is more deadly than the coral snakes. This time it can help us live, Chinita. Look, I'm a happy man. What do I need for that? Nothing! However, I always dream of inventing something important. Don't laugh! Köhner is giving me some jars that I'll use as an alembic. Oliveira will work for me. I will distil orange liquor. Your Papa is wise, so he can help me. We will earn so much, we'll be rich! Always so happy! I'm happy! What do I need for that? Nothing! I'll speak with Köhner, then Dr. Else, and the distillery will be built. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Beautiful evening, isn't it? Oh, it's you! - Did I scare you? - No. - I wasn't paying attention and... - I wanted to thank you. It was nothing, bringing you some water. To a Mensú, it is. You are not like the others. They are my brothers. They are suffering. Look. They treat us like animals. Some day... Listen. We live forgotten Like the spirits in the forests Amongst the thorns, we work Are they really alive, the men who keep us like this? The foreigners that bleed us dry, have no heart at all It's a complaint. I've always been so close to Papa, I don't understand much Guaraní. - You don't understand? - Very little. He says: life is sad for the Mensú. He lives, forgotten, in the traitorous jungle. Work is his destiny, only a woman, as beautiful as a star. Can brighten his dark nights. It's beautiful. Today was like that. When I was tied up, and you appeared. You didn't like it? No, that's not it. I had my own star, you know? When I was a girl, I made wishes, and when Papa was at the bar, I saw it shining through the window, and I wasn't afraid of being alone. The star that the Mensú see at the end of the trail. Inheritance, perhaps. Papa is a foreigner, from far away, but Mama lived in the loneliness of the mountains. She was the daughter of a Mensú. I'm going to see Papa. Good night. When did they die? You think they'll come back to life if you stare? Go! Leave! Tell me what happened. A little after Dr. Else gave them the medicine, they started to get worse, then they died. - What do you mean? - Yes, sir. He was drunk when he mixed the medicine. He could barely read the bottles. He mixed anything, and in any quantity. Don't say such stupid things. - Do you know the men you treated died? - The Mensú died... Mensús die like rats. The medicine is useless. Stop being a drunken fool. The men you killed cost me 600 pesos. You mixed the medicine without knowing what you were doing. All the flasks looked the same. Why are you taking me to the plantation? I'm useless! My head is empty. - I don't know any of this. - You must! Think of your daughter. Dr. Else drowned in alcohol. All that's left is old Else, drunk and useless. - I don't know any of that! - Don't shout! It's your fault. - Good evening. - Good evening. I don't know any of that. All the bottles were the same. - And death is the same as life! - Papa. Won't you do something for me? Yes, Chinita. You must drink less, and look after the sick on the plantation. Yes, Chinita, I'll do it for you. - Good morning boss! - Good morning. I must go to my office before it goes dark. Take them to the cabin. Then I'll speak with you, Doctor. - Tirafondo, my friend! - Welcome, my boy! How many girls have you left crying in Posadas, eh? Here it is, Dr. Else. This one. When you need provisions, go past the ferns, and it's there, behind the kitchen. Thank you. The rains will begin soon. The eternal issue. It feels like the rains cover my corpse. For 25 years I've been wrapped in a damp shroud, imprisoned by this land. Papa! I'm tired, Chinita. I'm talking nonsense. You must help the sick. Remember how you used to organise hospitals better than anyone, when you first arrived. They gave me a prize at the university in those times. I felt invincible. I came from the north, from a dry and rugged climate. I was going to return after two years. Like John Brown, who came to visit the ruins for a few hours, and stayed forever. Papa! I saw the damp loneliness of the jungle where death stalks. The rains were coming closer! After that, I abandoned the idea of going down the river, just like everyone, I dropped anchor next to a glass of rum. The same glass that is always full, because all the glasses are the same, and death is the same as life! Papa! Papa! Chinita, forgive me. I get carried away easily. I'm alright now. I'm alright now. Papa! Papa! You must save those people! You have to save them! Yes Chinita, yes. - Good evening, boss. - See you tomorrow. Papa! Poor Papa, how tired you are. The dinner's ready, Papa. I'm not hungry. Bring me a drink. Papa... I need it. Very well. Good evening. You are performing miracles, Dr. Else. In such short time, the sickness has gone. I don't perform miracles, it's the medicine that cures them. We're short of everything here. Look at Malaria. It's spreading and wreaking havoc. We have too little medicine, and too many outbreaks. If only we could cut back the swamps. This land is invincible, Else. You can beat her back with machetes, but only for a moment. She will always rise again. Cut back the swamps! What a great idea! And even that wouldn't be enough. Death has other tricks, Doctor. You are right. We have to fight. It's all the same. - Good evening. - Good evening. May I pass? What do you want at this hour? - I got a bit wet! - Speak! Of course, boss. I went to see my friend, Podeley. He was almost unconscious with fever. I came to see whether the Doctor could see him. The Doctor is tired. You must go, Papa. - Will you stay with Köhner? - No, I'll come with you. Good evening, Köhner. Good evening. He will be alright. He is young and strong. Give him a spoonful every 2 hours. Look after him! Rest assured, Doctor. - Anything happens, call me. - Of course! - Until tomorrow. - Until tomorrow. You are better now, my boy. Come with me to the bar for a drink. - They were rough days, old timer. - Wasn't it just. You babbled like a madman. Only babbling... - She wasn't here, old timer, was she? - Who? Something had occurred to me. Nonsense. One of those things that you young people get excited about. Who knows? - Are you coming? - I'll stay here. - See you later. - See you later. It's that strong! You see my friend! It can't be broken! It's really strong, my friend. The best cane in the world! That's true! The Doctor is strong to be drinking cachaça! Let him drink! He's earned it! He's a tiger! In a few months, he's chased the sickness off the plantation. Dr. Else. I want to speak with you. My wife is very sick. She is shivering with fever. A pen! I don't understand any of this! Rum! Rum! Rum! I want to close, sir. But a night like this... The people don't want to leave. Just a little longer. Give Dr. Else whatever he wants. I'll pay. Papa! Forgive me, Andrea. As there was no-one home, I came in. Papa isn't here. You wanted to see him, didn't you? You know all too well I'm not here for your father. Köhner! How long will you keep up this indifference that burns my soul! Köhner! Forgive me. I didn't mean to speak like that. I didn't mean to speak like that. It's the heat that's attacking my nerves. Esteban. I can't take any more, Esteban. I can't take any more. Hush Chinita, calm down. Köhner, the loneliness, the vipers! My nerves are gone, Esteban! With no-one in the world, if only my mother were alive. I'm not no-one, Chinita. Mama was the daughter of a Mensú. Just like you, Esteban. Now that I have you so close, and you're real, not like in my fever dream, when I saw you here with your father. That was me, Esteban. - You? - Just me. I belong to your people. And to me. - Goodbye, Esteban. - Goodbye. Chinita. - Chinita! - Papa. You are up early! Did you know that the one-armed man insists that I help him, with science! How funny! He asked me, when I don't know anything about that! What? He wants to distil spirits from oranges. I convinced Köhner to put down some capital. The one-armed man dreams that everyone will get rich enough to leave. Dreams! Dreams! Madness! Impossible! The red earth imprisons men. A magnetic paradise! It attracts them. Now they cannot leave. Here... forever. It's too thick. You have to cut it thinner. I don't know what this place has that attracts you. In San Ignacio, there are more, and a better class of, people! - When are we going? - Tomorrow, on the afternoon steamboat. I see you so seldom, Chinita! Did you know that everything is ready? Köhner is a partner in the distillery, Dr. Else is my scientific advisor, and you, logically, will come with us. Think of what you'll do with all the money! I envy your character. I'm a happy man! What more do I need? Let's go to the office. - Are you not coming, Andrea? - I prefer to stay. Very well. Shall we go? 200. Lift! 230. 200. 200? And the 30, boss? An idiot tax! My beautiful girl! I have to speak to you seriously, Esteban. We're leaving tomorrow. - Did you forget I'm leaving too? - The contract ended! Esteban, together again on the boat, but it will all be so different this time. Chinita, you are in my soul, and my blood. Remember, the boat leaves at 6. How much does he owe? 600 pesos, Mr. Köhner. Renew his contract. Let's see the next one. He's a servant, and sick. He owes... Your account is clear. You can go. Those who are ready, be on your way, or you'll miss the boat. Podeley. He owes 500 pesos. I don't owe anything! There must be some mistake! Look again! Please! The account is correct. It's always the same low-life! So you learn to not waste time complaining. The year's work you owe you'll spend at kilometre 37. They'll break you with work. When I return from San Ignacio, we won't see each other again. Goodbye. Well Chinita, soon we'll begin our journey to riches! Already? We will triumph! The orange liquor will be made. I'm a happy man! What do I need for that? Good day, Andrea. Why didn't you let Podeley get on board? He had a name? - Why worry so much? - Shut up! Podeley is a Mensú. Listen, Andrea. Those people are like plants or insects. They belong to the land. They endure the rain, the heat... But they love too, and you, Köhner, know nothing but hate. You're wrong, Andrea. If you could love me... Never Köhner! You hear? Never! You have everything you need to be happy, but you're always looking for trouble. You were speaking of love, Köhner? I've read the entry in this book carefully. Did you know that to love is to understand? You don't love these people, nor this land. - That's why you don't understand them. - You don't give up! The red earth has soiled your bag, and you've got it in the pages of your encyclopaedia. No, Köhner. Where there's a friendly face and a hunk of bread, there you'll find my world. What do I need to be happy? Leave me be! I dreamt of breaking my loneliness, but it's useless. I'll get to San Ignacio, do what I need to, then return to be alone. As I always was. Alone. Leave me, leave me! Spiders! Chinita! Andrea! Does no-one clean these cobwebs? Andrea! Papa, what are you doing? Why didn't you clean the cobwebs? Calm down Papa, calm down. I feel very sick, Chinita. Very sick. Did you drink again, Papa? Last night, I saw spiders. And a white rat. Enormous. I feel very sick. Very sick. Don't drink any more, Papa. I won't, Chinita, I won't. I won't drink again. He's sick. Very sick. He sees cobwebs where I swept three times. Calm yourself. He will get better soon. Ever since we left the plantation, bad luck has followed us. Everything will be alright. Last night, I dreamt of climbing stairs. A good sign! Then yesterday I heard from a friend of Podeley. He says he will be here soon! - Yes? - Of course! I'm preparing everything so when he arrives, we can head south. Hello! At last I've found you. What's happened? They've sent me this letter from Buenos Aires. The samples of aged liquor don't make it, they say! Who sent them? - He did, that's why I'm here. - I gave them to Dr. Else. He said he would send them himself. He's a great man, but so wild! He drinks it all! Doesn't leave a drop! You've rubbed salt into the wound. And it's a wound that isn't easily cured. Dr. Else had another attack. He thinks he sees bugs everywhere. Poor Chinita. It's at 5 o'clock, when the whistle knocks! At 5, when the whistle blows. When the whistle blows at 5, we have to make a move. Are you sick? It must be today, the dogs are back at camp with the new arrivals. Back to work, faker! Let's go! Take the mountain! Come on, take the mountain! Take the mountain! Look for me in the mountains. Go! Get up! Get up! Get up! To the trail to the river! Move! Get on! Get up there! Back to your own land, damned gringo! I raise you! - I call! - It's four to call! Give me another rum, boss. Coming! So, Dr. Else's getting worse? Poor fellow. He's a great man, but he drinks all of my samples! - A drink, sergeant? - No, I'm on duty! They've sent us looking for something we'll never find. Let's go. They're looking for us here. The soldiers won't go into the jungle. They're afraid of the bugs! What's going on? - You don't know? - No. There was a fight at Köhner's work camp and several Mensú disappeared. And Esteban Podeley settled an old debt with Köhner. What? He drove him onto a raft, - then sent him down the river. - They found him in a backwater. Why are they after Podeley? One of the injured guards saw him whipping Köhner. Damned gringo... It was well deserved! - One-arm - What? - Did you hear? - Yes. And the guards? Podeley is in danger, we must help. He'd be better off dead than in the hands of those animals. But why worry? Surely he's on his way to Brazil in the jungle? No, One-arm, I know him well. He loves Chinita and he won't go without her. He can only be in one place. I know where to find him. Give this to Andrea, and tell her what's happened. Goodbye. It's Olivera. - Olivera, what luck that you've come! - I know I'd find you here. You've got to leave, brother! The police are after you, - and worse, the guards! - They won't find me. - How's Chinita? - She's well. It's Dr. Else who's sick. But listen, you have to go, to save your life! One wrong step, and you could be killed! A vision, my boy? This time, I didn't dream anything. I saw Köhner's guards, and they aren't police. You must go! I won't leave till tomorrow. Tell Chinita to come! - She won't leave her father. - Bring him too. We'll go south, where men aren't slaves. Hide! Remember, if they see you... Chinita is more than just my life, brother. If the guards are in San Ignacio, they're already on your trail. Be careful with them, brother. Here, this is a talisman. It'll keep you safe. - A bad sign! - Lay off the divinations. Let's go. And that's all Podeley told me. Thank you, Olivera. I'll tell Papa. This land holds its prisoners tight. Are you asleep, Papa? No, Chinita. I don't sleep much these days. This land and air, they make you sick, Papa. We have to leave. Leave! I used to think that. How strange. I don't dream of snow any more. Have I ever seen the snow? Not so far, Papa! There, your daughter would dream of the rains, and the noise of insects on these beautiful nights. Where, then? Down the river, where men are better. How? With what? Tomorrow at sundown we can go with Esteban. He has everything ready. You need to know, Papa, we must leave, you understand? Yes, my girl, yes. Thank you, Papa. Thank you. - There will be no spiders tonight. - No, Papa. You need to rest. Come on, lie down. You'll start your life over, Papa. I've been here for 25 years under the rains, like a tree trunk rotting in a backwater. But your happiness is all I want, Chinita. Until tomorrow, Papa. Papa, has something happened? No, my girl, no. What have you done, Papa? Poor Papa, it's nothing! I'm better now. Tomorrow, at sundown, we'll leave. Esteban will take us far from here. Where those attacks won't return. I'm going to sleep in my bed. Papa! I'm going to die! My girl! My girl! Listen to me, Papa, for once in your life. Don't drink any more. Your daughter... ...begs you. We'll leave... ...far... ...away... ...forever. For... ...ever. We could have waited by the river, no? There's less danger here. We'll leave at sundown when they arrive. Them, with her, no? Will she come? She'll come. And Chinita? You must be strong, Podeley. Last night, Dr. Else had another attack, and... Poor thing. She came all the same. The guards! - Let's go, Podeley. - Where? South! You go. I'm staying. - I'm going with her. - You're crazy! - She won't go alone! - They'll kill you! What does it matter?
