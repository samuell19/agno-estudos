(Thunder crashing) * There. Okay. That's my mom? (Laughing) Liam! (Lightning crashing) What is that? (Woman screaming) (Electricity crackling) (Thunder rumbling distantly) (Woman gasping) (Dog barking) (Gasping) FEMALE REPORTER 1: County Dispatch was inundated about a loud boom shaking houses. FEMALE REPORTER 2: And these pictures are streaming in-- (Audio warbled) --Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C. Some of these pulls have been accompanied by huge, bright flashes. (Voices garbled) FEMALE REPORTER 3: Good morning, everyone. This what has so many people... (Indistinct audio) trees and the power lines, a virtual minefield in the streets... (Thunder crashing) MALE REPORTER 1: ...Power of the storm. The winds are pretty strong, and the Category 1 hurricane with gusts... FEMALE REPORTER 4: At least 14 confirmed dead... (Indistinct radio chattering) * I've specified the assumptions unsupported by evidence. A revision with further quantitative data to support the hypothesis would put the research in good standing to be approved. What assumptions? Um, three variables for instance. Yes, but it would be impractical to isolate and test each one. We can proceed with a Factorial Experiment. It doesn't look good authorizing funding on a long shot. What about the risk in not furthering this research? Look, Nigel, I've been collecting data for over a year now. Below the 60th parallel south, hmm? That region's had low pressure findings for over four decades. The possibility of an atmospheric shift that would catastrophically increase storm severity-- Jamie, you don't have the evidence to support it. You understand? I look forward to your follow-up. Enjoy your holiday. Oh, by the way, you're aware of the storm system tracking northwest from Wisconsin? Yeah. There are cottages in Chisholm 40 miles south of its path. Good. Enjoy yourself. Hi. Hey. I heard. Sorry. Yeah. I'll keep my eye out for those warning signals while you're gone. You mean the sky darkening due to atmospheric pressure? You know, I think some time off would do you some good. Sometimes distance offers perspective. (Chuckling) You know what? You are right. LARA: Wow. It looks like you're taking a real vacation. Yeah. First one since my honeymoon. Have fun. (Video game music playing) Kylie? Hey, can I come in? Give me a sec. I'm almost done. Well, we're leaving in 10 minutes, so pack them or put them away, okay? Ten minutes. I'm packed. LIAM: Like, why are you mad? It's just a couple days with my family. No, you know I won't have my phone. I just-- I'll call you if I can, but I-- Krista? Hello? You all right? Yeah. Laundry. We're leaving in 10, okay? Thanks. Yeah. Hey, don't leave any food in your room. I don't want to have to come back and hunt for the smell. That's why I eat fast food. It never goes bad. Well, neither does the wrapper it comes in, so you should eat that too if you're going to defend it. So when are you coming up with Nana? Probably this afternoon, maybe tomorrow morning. Depends how she feels. Okay, cool. Hey, buddy, can you do me a favour? Take your sister out while you're up there? Activities. Keep her busy. Okay. You got it, Mom. Thanks. (Phone line ringing) Get it in while you can. That's the plan. What are you doing anyway? Controlling the universe. Great. Care to send something my way? KYLIE: It doesn't work that way. It only controls through threat of mass destruction. That's wonderful, honey. Hey. Perfect timing. Hi. Yeah, well it's much easier to leave on time, when the kids can pack for themselves. Well, not for me. I have to ask Kylie 10 times before she listens. Guess you have the touch. No, I have the look. I know you're joking, and it still terrifies me. (Both laughing) You okay to drive? You-- You got a good sleep last night? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Hey, Kylie, not in the front, okay? Why? Megan is, uh... (Clearing throat) She's coming? Yeah. Ky, can you just give us a few seconds, Kylie? Wow, Jamie. I called, left you a message. When is she coming? Today. Today? Yeah, we're picking her up right after this. Is there a problem? Tomorrow we are commemorating Dad, which is the only reason Mom and I are coming. It's one day, Jamie. Have her come on Monday. I called twice. I left messages both times. Did you ask? What? When you called, did you ask if I was okay with it? Yes, of course. Well, I'm not. You didn't return my call, I assumed it was okay. (Laughing) Okay, Jamie. Look, Charlie I-- I've been with Megan for almost a year now. Oh, I'm so glad you can count to one. Because, you know I forgot, after 15 years. Charlotte-- CHARLOTTE: This is ridiculous, Jamie! Do you know how easy this could be? JAMIE: I called. Communicate! That's it. I can't wait to move out. All right, time to go, guys. Wait. Hand me the phones. Both of you. Both of them. Your mom and I made a deal. Let's go. LIAM: Shotgun. Hold on, Liam. I'm going to have Megan, uh... Whatever. Good times. (Indistinct chattering) (Engine starting) * (Thunder rumbling) And don't forget my olives for the spaghetti sauce. I got it, I got it. Go. How many days are we going for? One. Two tops. A lot of people coming. I just wonder if we have enough food. Mom, we're never going to get there if you don't go upstairs and pack. Please, I would like to leave today. Don't forget the pickles. Okay. Thank you. Hey, Ky. Why don't you tell Megan about your science project. Hmm? Okay. I did a science project. So, our science projects involve local recycling. Donations graciously from the fish factory. So, to answer your question, no dissections. LIAM: Yes, while that is gross, when we did the rat dissections, some dude cuts off the tail, wraps it around his neck, wears it for like a week. Hmm, very fashion-forward. A tie and cologne in one. He sounds cool. Yeah, maybe you should take him to the prom. I've a cow's eye dissection coming up. That could be my corsage. Kylie, come on, that is sick. Liam. Dad, that is sick. Do you want me to apologize for that? Yes. Kylie, do you want me to apologize? No. Well, okay, then. Let's hit the road. LIAM: Would it kill you to be a little nicer? JAMIE: This is fun! (Engine starting) (Thunder crashing) (Indistinct chattering over TV) FEMALE REPORTER: ...Travelled 28 miles from a storm hub north of Saginaw, striking a series of power lines and a young man who was walking nearby with his girlfriend. Tragically, he was killed instantly. (Man speaking indistinctly over TV) (Thunder rumbling) (Dialling) Who are you calling? Jamie. There's nothing you can do about it now. (Cell phone ringing) (Vibrating) Hello? Hello. Are you planning on having her come on our hike? Let's-- Let's talk about this later. No. We're talking about it now. My mom hasn't even met her yet. Hello? I'm driving. I shouldn't be on the phone. This is a family tradition, Jamie. Let's talk about it tonight. So you are planning on bringing her then. Okay, bye. Jamie... (Dial tone buzzing) (Dialling) Now you're just embarrassing yourself. Yeah, thank you for your running commentary. The only thing running is your temper. JAMIE, OVER ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, you've reached Jamie. Leave a message. Damn it, Jamie. Let it go. * (Inaudible chattering) It's 33 miles, not 28. You're sure? Okay, thanks. That's 3 miles past the record. Great. America loves breaking records. (Lara laughing) (Phone ringing) Lara speaking. RANDALL, OVER PHONE: It's Randall. There was another bolt from the blue strike. Really? It traveled north 36 miles. Thirty-six? My feelings exactly. I'll keep you posted. Okay. Thank you. * (Lightning crashing) CHARLOTTE: Oh! Oh, sh-- Oh, gosh! Are you okay? Yeah, are you? Uh-huh. Charlotte, get back in the car. Charlotte! (Thunder crashing) CHARLOTTE: Roll up the window. MILLY: Why? Because if we're struck with a window down the current will come inside. No, we have rubber tires. No, that's a myth. We're safe inside a car because it acts like a Faraday cage. A what? A sealed enclosure with a conductive surface. The frame is metal, so as long as there's no gaping holes like the window, the current will pass along the outside and go to the ground. Okay. (Laughing) Wow, I know way too much about this from Jamie. And thank goodness you do. (Both sighing) Okay. (Exhaling) (Lightning crashing) (Cell phone ringing) (Turns ringer off) Oh, Megan, when we get up the mountain road here, we lose cell phone service, so I'd use it now if you need to. Okay. Thanks. Oh, so, she gets to use her phone? Oh, come on, Ky. Dad, take a joke. Charlotte and I decided the kids couldn't use their cell phones for the weekend. How old were you guys when you got one? I was 11. Liam was 13. Yeah. Wow, 11. Well, that feels really young. And do you like it? Having a phone? Yeah, just being in constant contact with your peers. You can't get away. Last year there was an 88% increase in cyberbullying. I've never been bullied, so I like it. Good. (Cell phone ringing) (Turning ringer off) JAMIE, OVER ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, you've reached Jamie. I can't take you call. Leave a message- Hi, Jamie. Two boys were killed from one bolt in Duluth. This is very serious. Please keep the kids inside. And call me. RADIO BROADCASTER: ...Struck without warning. He wasn't discovered till his roommate came home and called 911. By the time the ambulance and firefighters got to the scene, he was already presumed dead. Today's weather reports have failed to indicate... Can you text him and just say, "Turn on the news. It's very serious. Call me." ...Verified sightings, a bolt from the blue. All within the last hour. Officials are unaware of the total death toll, and are asking the public to stay indoors. If you need to travel anywhere... The text won't go through. * (Lightning crashing) It's really hot up here. JAMIE: It'll air out soon enough. Liam. Yo. Come up here. How gross is it up there? Not as gross as down there. I got it. You got it? Okay. You know, I don't even like these. Yes, you do. Nope. (Laughing): You do. Here, catch. (Thunder crashing) I was expecting it to have burnt to the ground. Well, not all of life is a metaphor. But, yeah, wow, it took a beating. So all of life is a metaphor. So, what do you want to do? Nothing. Staying up here all week so Dad gets super worried and awkward around Megan. You know, she's really not that bad. So, what, you like her now? No, she's just...nice and-- I don't know. "Do you guys like having phones?" As if we're some human subspecies. Okay, first of all, no one will ever call you human. Second of all, she could be a lot worse. Did Dad ask you to talk to me about her? No. Swear? Yeah, I swear. Mom wanted me to make sure we did "activities" together, but nothing with Dad. Well, I guess I can tell you that Mom asked me to watch out for you too. What'd she say? To make sure you don't get too big a head. Okay, uh, one: not English. And, what? "I have never been bullied." Yeah, I haven't. Yeah, but who says that? That's like me saying, "I've never gone a day in my life being hungry." You haven't I know, but you wouldn't say that to someone who's starving. Oh, okay, so you think Megan was bullied. I don't. I also think Dad wouldn't care, because he wouldn't realize if he was being bullied. And you like getting bullied. If you can't join them, then don't. Any moment, is my prediction. What? LARA: Wait till you see this. Did you check the update on the Vertical Temperature Profile? No. I'm going to go check. (Thunder rumbling) KYLIE: Liam! Liam! Yeah? If we can get Dad to drive us to the bike path, I'll come. Why? You hate biking. Yeah, but today I don't, because then I don't have to go to the waterfall with Dad and Gag-an. Okay, um, here's the thing. I'm not going to the bike path. I'm going into town to call Krista. Oh, your girlfriend. "Aw, I miss you so much. It's been three hours!" Whatever. Something that you-- You need to know about me. Oh, yeah? Yup. I hate waterfalls, so the only way that you can get me to go is if you carry me... kicking and screaming. All right, so what you're saying is you don't want to go? Correct. But I thought you wanted to. It's not about me. It's about Kylie. She's just being a teenager. It's all a phase, like you said. But that was in hindsight. Of course. Jamie, I... I told you that I was grateful that my parents didn't stick around for the sake of the kids. You know, that they got divorced when they did. Right, and this is why-- But it's not how it felt at the time. It felt terrible. My parents became these whimsical, unreliable creatures. "Creatures" is a little strong. Look, Kylie's learning that-- That anyone can break her trust, even a mom or a dad. But this is what I don't want. But we all learn that eventually. The point is, for her to move forward, she needs to learn how to trust herself. And you can't figure that out for her. Look I'm going to be around all week, and I am hoping that she can forget that for a little while so she can enjoy herself. That is not true. She likes you. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Please go, the two of you, to the waterfall. Listen to her. Okay? I will, raptly, to all 10 words she'll speak to me. Okay, I'll try. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hmm. (Chuckling) (Lightning crashing) JAMIE: Kylie. you ready? Yeah. Where's Megan? Is she laggin'? She's just staying behind. Why? She just wants to read and relax. (Sighing) (Laughing): Come on, let's go. This'll be fun. Chop, chop. * If the Earth is trying to neutralize through positive lightning, it means the Earth's crust has increased its negative charge. So either the Earth's core has an increased pressure... Which it isn't. ...or there's a compromised flow of protons from the sun. Hmm. Yeah. JAMIE, OVER ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, you've reached Jamie. I can't take your call. Leave a message. (Lightning crashing) * JAMIE: I love it out here. Isn't this awesome? Yup. Do you want to walk in front? No, I'm good. You're just right behind me. Just, I want to make sure that when we get there we have enough time to eat, to drink-- Drown. Kylie. Well, if you're stressed about time, just go back now. Oh, no, no, no. We are doing this. I'm taking the lead. Try and keep up. LIAM: What the hell was that? FATHER: What are you doing? Come inside! (News reporter speaking indistinctly over TV) Uh, hello. FEMALE REPORTER: Now it looks like another network of floods. Get your umbrellas if you're going out. Possible thunderstorms for the next few hours. Cloudy tomorrow, with a 50% chance of precipitation. NEWS BROADCASTER: The fire we reported is still burning out of control. A three-block area has been evacuated. You might want to avoid that route on the way home. And there was another drive-by shooting today downtown. It appears to be gang-related... (Phone line ringing) Do you smell that? What? It's a metallic kind of burnt-like scent. It's called the forest, Dad. So where's everyone sleeping tonight? Uh, well, Mom and Nana are in the bedroom, and I brought a tent. Is Mom still coming? Of course. She seemed kind of pissed. That makes it a guarantee she'll come. (Laughing) So did Megan know Mom was coming? Yeah, yeah. She looked forward to it. No kidding. Kylie, that's enough. What? Tomorrow was about Grandpa. For once, a weekend that's not about her. Megan is here, okay? That's the last I want to hear about it. (News reporter speaking indistinctly over TV) Here. Thanks. Sure. Still no luck with your folks? No. So, what were you doing out there? We just didn't know about the storm. And they're all at the cottage? No. My sister and my dad, they went hiking to this stream that we go to. Well, they would be back by now, wouldn't they? I don't think so. They were planning on having dinner there, and then maybe hiking back at sunset. Thousands of residents in the Twin Cities and surrounding areas are without electricity. It remains unclear exactly how many people have been killed or hurt. We do know there are 16 confirmed fatalities, and close to 30 injured. Okay, I'm going to go and get started on some dinner. LIAM: No. Thank you for everything. But I'm going to go. Go where? To the stream. I have to. MOTHER: No, you cannot go out there. Uh, can you just... hang here for a second, honey? I guess. I... Take a breath. Have some water, okay? (Sighing) * You sure you don't want to walk over to the lookout? Yup. It's-- It's just over there. Suit yourself. I thought we were leaving soon. Fifteen minutes. VIDEO BROADCASTER, OVER TV: We have Nigel Green here with us today. Nigel, what is the difference between positive and negative lightning? Or are they about the same when it strikes? NIGEL: Positive lightning rarely strikes due to the increased distance it must travel to make contact. I think that guy works with my dad. The meteorologist? Yeah. Yeah, apparently he's a d-bag. NIGEL: Seeking to neutralize by striking a target of opposite charge. A potential increase in the earth's crust's negative charge could account for these new occurrences. He's totally doing the, "Don't worry, citizens. We have this under control." Yeah. Totally. MOTHER: So we're just going to let him walk out that door? FATHER: If I drive that boy up there and something happens to him on the way, that's on us. * Charlotte, could you please be more careful? We're almost there. It doesn't matter. It will matter if you drive us off the side of the road. Driving 10 miles slower won't make a difference. It might. (Thunder crashing) Kylie, you got to come look! The sky is absolutely gorgeous! So take a photo! (Thunder crashing) I can't stay here any longer. I don't see how you going out there is going to help anything. I don't know. I'll figure it out. They could need me. But then it's the three of you stuck up there with a bike. How does that help? I don't know. You coming? Uh, you can drive? (Tires screeching) CHARLOTTE: Oh, thank God. We made it. No thanks to your driving, dear. (Thunder crashing) Kylie? Kylie. What? Get-- Get out of the water! Let me go! (Groaning) Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Daddy! Kylie? Liam? Charlotte. Hi. Where are the children? Oh, sorry, everyone went out. Hi, I'm-- Where did they go? Uh, Liam, he's gone mountain biking. And Kylie and Jamie, they went for a hike. Where? Uh, I think Liam said something about a biking path. And Kylie and Jamie, they were going to go to the waterfall, but I think they ended up going to the streams. Nice to meet you-- Did they take the walkie-talkies? You want batteries? I don't think so. What's going on? There's a very big storm coming. It's coming here? Any moment. I wouldn't go outside if I were you. You could get hit by lightning. Lightning? (Thunder rumbling) KYLIE: Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Daddy! Dad! (Groaning) Dad! (Grunting) Kylie, you okay? Yeah. Dad, Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Ah. It's okay. Dad, your leg. It's okay. Wait, wait. I'm okay. We got to go. No, no, no. Aah! Did you see where that lightning bolt came from? There was only one thunderstorm 40 miles north of us. Forty miles. We got to go to the cabin. Dad-- We got to go the-- Aah! Dad. I need my walking sticks. Get the walking sticks. Okay, stay there. (Groaning) (Lightning crashing) (Inaudible) Any more? Jamie? No. Confidential, I know. And our duty to protect public safety? We identify the areas high in phosphate or sulfate, those being most vulnerable to attract positive lightning, then we warn the public to avoid these areas during a thunderstorm. And that's it? Yeah. It's the job. (Thunder rumbling) Okay, Megan, you drive to the stream. Take this. The signal in the hill is brutal, but at least it's something. Can you write her out directions? Sure. What are you going to do? I'm going for the bike path. You should stay here in case someone comes back. Okay. I don't know what's going on. No one does. Do you know how much gas Jamie had in his car? MEGAN: Yeah, we, uh-- We just filled it up on our way. CHARLOTTE: Good. Did he take his backpack? Yeah. The keys aren't here, which means they're probably in his backpack. Okay, you keep that on. Buzz me if something changes. I'm going for Liam, and then to the stream. I'm coming with you. No, it's okay. Charlotte, Megan should go with you. Keep this on. (Jamie grunting) Aah! Damn it! How about I walk in front, and you lean on me for balance? No. I want you-- I want you to go back to the cabin. Tell Megan she needs to call Lara Granger. Dad, I'm not leaving you. You have to. We don't have time for me to get there. If you go now-- Dad, I'm not leaving you! Just grab me the notepad from my backpack. You have to get out of here. You have to get to a shelter. Here. Aah! Give this to Megan, okay? Tell her-- Dad, I am not leaving you! We're going back together! You're not listening to me! You never listen! Fine. Let's go. We've got to move. (Grunting) (Thunder rumbling) So how come you didn't go with your family on the hike? Just felt like riding. I didn't know they were going until I was leaving. And things were getting really weird at the cabin. How come? Well, my parents split like two years ago. We haven't been back since. And then my grandpa passed away last year. We have this whole tradition thing we do, so we're making a really big deal of it. Like, my nana and my mom are coming up. Then Dad brought his girlfriend, and things got weird. So I rode into town to call my... call my friend. (Grunting) * I feel like we should've been there by now. Yeah, this... this feels far. Well, maybe I took a wrong turn. Should I turn around? No! No, let's go a little further. (Engine starting) Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam! Liam! Did you see him? No. Charlotte, he's not here. We need to get back-- You don't know. You don't have kids. If he is injured, if he's in the forest-- Charlotte, get in the car! No! Liam's not here. No one is here. And if he's out there, he needs you to find him. Please. (Walkie-talkie crackling) Milly, it's Megan. We're at the bike path. Liam's not here. (Jamie clearing throat) (Thunder rumbling) Come on. No, no, no. We should rest longer. We don't have time. Help me up. Okay. Let's go. I don't know if there's going to be a better place to turn around. There has to be somewhere. But it's only gotten more narrow, though. (Sighing) Liam, I'm so sorry. No, it's-- It's fine. It's not your fault. But you wanted to get to your family. I know, but they'll be okay. They'll be okay. (Lightning crashing) Whoa! Where is that lightning coming from? I have no idea. Um, look, maybe we should just wait out the storm here? LARA: There's been an increase in ozone content in every target area. By how much? Two PPM's. So check atmospheric pressure. I made a call for a sample. Good. * MEGAN: Is that Liam's bike? (Lightning crashing) CHARLOTTE: Yeah, it's Liam's. Do you know whose bike that is? This is my son's bike. Well, did you find them? Find who? This is my son's bike. Is he okay? Your son took my daughter, stole our truck, and went back up the mountain. Your-- Your daughter? You have to find them. You have to help me find them. (Thunder crashing) Come in. ANNOUNCER, OVER RADIO: Although Duluth and Minnesota are no longer within bolt from the storm cloud, the National Weather Institute advises all residents of Northwest Minnesota to remain inside until their safety is assured. Latest figures: 38 fatalities and over 150 injuries. This is Alonzo Dennigan with your weekend weather report. The lightning storm has slowed, everybody down this weekend and is showing no signs of letting up this week. Charlotte? Charlotte are you there? (Walkie-talkie crackling) Charlotte if you can hear me, no one is back here. ...No humidity in the air, so it feels quite comfortable here at the moment. There is no rain in the forecast for the next five days. But we do expect a visual lightning bolt activity. There have been reports of... Nana! Oh, my gosh! Jamie! Aah! Jamie, what's wrong? Dad, are you okay? What happened? What happened? There was lightning, and... Dad, I didn't know what to do. I need to sit up. Get up. Is Liam back? Where is everyone? I-- I don't know. Well, you tell me. My husband has been out searching for them for the last hour and he hasn't found... My son doesn't even drive. Well, Bailey has never done anything like this before. Neither has Mother Nature. He was going to bike if we didn't drive him. CHARLOTTE: Bike where? Well, I guess to warn you guys about the storm. To the cabin? No, to the stream. So that's where they went in the truck? Yeah, except my husband has been to every stream in the area, up and down, and he hasn't found anything. What does your truck look like? It's a black pickup. Okay. We're going to bring your daughter back. Let's go. No AP change. There's been an increase in ozone, and then the sky colour, but no connection with atmospheric pressure. So, what is it? A fluke. Obviously there's a relationship between increased ozone and this storm. But... we're not going to find out wasting our time with this. (Sighing) I can't believe I didn't bring my laptop Careful. Mom, are you there? I'm with Dad and Nana. We're heading to the hospital, but everyone's okay. I'm trying. Okay. Everybody in? They must have already gone. No, no. We would've-- We would've seen them. Maybe they've already gone back to the cabin We would have crossed paths with them. Milly, you there? (Static crackling) You're right. Unless they turned up to go to the cabin. Just in case they can hear us. Megan and Charlotte. We think Liam's gone back to the cabin, so we're headed back. Let's go. (Engine starting) (Lightning crashing) Still no service. Come on, come on. Yes. Dad. (Phone line ringing) What? Are we almost at the hospital? Yeah, I've got to make this call first. Your legs need to get looked at. Don't worry. We'll be there soon, okay? You mentioned your grandpa. What was that tradition he started with your family? Oh, um... okay, so Grandpa had this crazy philosophy that you always need a climbing rope on you whenever you're in nature. So a couple years back he goes on this hike with my dad, and of course my dad forgets the rope. So Grandpa, being a total hard-ass, makes him go all the way back to get it. And then, to make sure he really learns his lesson, he cuts off a piece of the rope and ties it around a tree. That's it. Wait, are you the family that ties the rope to that tree? Yeah. Why-- Why do you know that? (Laughing): That's hilarious. I know that tree. People talk about it in town. Really? Yeah, you're like, famous. Cool. So then what happened? Nothing, really. We just sort of kept doing it. You know, every year, same tree, same yellow rope. That's cool. Kind of. * Thank you. Hey! And what are you doing out of bed? I'm fine. Really? What's this dripping into your arm? It's for hydration. Okay, let's lie down and let it hydrate. Milly-- Jamie, lie down. (Sighing) The doctor said you'll be okay. Yeah, they-- They said the weakness was only temporary. Hey, you okay? I still can't reach Mom. Mom, and Liam will be fine. Now, what I need from you is to go up to one of the higher floors and keep trying, okay? The reception's much better up there. (Zipper rasping) Okay. You have to work? Well, Ky, this time it's much more than just my job. You take it easy. Okay, thanks. Thanks, Milly. Damn it, where's my phone? Okay, here we go. FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Burning a hole right through the apartment building, instantly killing a family of four. Eyewitnesses described it as a burning ball of white fire. St. Louis County. Same city that sent that video. It looks like ball lightning. Two accounts in one city in one day? Previous recordings of soil elements cited were what? Silicone, calcium-- And iron. Is it possible that this ball lighting is the same one that did that? Well, it typically travels at 15 miles per hour, and can last up to 15 seconds. Yeah, but if the house were here, then it's possible. Otherwise-- Hi. LARA: Hi. Are you okay? It looks like you're in a hospital. Yes, I'm fine. Tell me what you guys have so far. An increase in ozone concentration in every area with bolt from the blue sightings. There hasn't been any shift in atmospheric pressure. Well, how much did it increase by? Two parts per million. Okay. Um... what altitude did you measure atmospheric pressure? Sea level. I'm going to send you guys a screenshot. It was an add-on to my proposal but there was only a few accounts, so I didn't include it in my case study. Decreased air pressure at 35,000 feet above sea level when ozone content is increased between two to three PPM's. Did you check pressure at other altitudes? No. Lara, get me barometric measurements between 15 and 40,000. I'm on it. Okay. (Lightning crashing) Do you see that? Yeah. What-- What is that? What the heck was that? I don't know! Let's go! Liam! He's not in the car. Megan... It's Liam's. (Lightning crashing) There. Okay. Jamie, there's a decrease in air pressure above 20,000 feet. Decrease air pressure: boom, we got fireworks. Where's Nigel? He's reporting it. Okay, I'm looking at the ball lightning sights, and they're too far apart to be the same one. I know. Yeah, well, it might be a coincidence. But if it's not, I bet there's more. Give me the St. Louis' damage report. Forest fires, anything that could have been caused by the ball lightning. So you're thinking, what? There's a targeted area? No, it's not a coincidence. Right. Hi, can I get a report? (Both panting) We need to get inside, away from whatever that was. Yeah. Um, there first, okay? Just stay as low to the ground as you can. Let's go! Bailey! Bailey, come on! Come on! On three, ready? Ready? One, two... three! Run! Go! Come on, you got it, you got it, you got it, you got it. You got it. Okay, ready? We're going over there. Okay. See it? Let's go! (Lightning crashing) Have you seen the news and what's been happening? Jamie, you won't believe it. There was a huge fire at a junkyard. Which could've been from ball lightning. And iron in the scrap metal could have a negative charge. And it's an exposed area of phosphate and sulfate. Both negative charges. Positive lightning is travelling at a radius of 50 miles, targeting the most vulnerable areas. I got the surveillance video. Come on, we're almost there. (Thunder rumbling) You okay? Be careful. Come on. Yes! Go! Go! (Panting) Maybe they went in here. Yeah. It's a junkyard. They might be looking for shelter. MEGAN: Yeah. I don't know what to do. Do I keep trying? Yes. These things are stupid. They don't work. Milly connected with Megan earlier. I just keep thinking that they're not answering... Hey, hey. Don't do that. Your Mom knows more about lightning than most of my colleagues. And maybe she won't hate me so much for not shutting up. Come here. It's okay. (Computer chiming) Hey. The attack lasted for 40 minutes, with strikes at increasingly shorter intervals. The last 15, seven seconds apart. Seven seconds? We located all scrap yards and alerted evacuation. Are there any high-risk facilities near them? Pantar Chemical. That's on the northeast coast. We've sent for priority barometric measurements in all areas with forecasted thunderstorms. And decreased air pressure? Above 30,000. We have three days. NIGEL: Jamie... there's a scrap metal yard in Chisholm. (Both breathing heavily) It's moving closer. We can't stay here. You're right. Okay, ready? (Lightning crashing) That's my mom? (Laughing) Liam! (Lightning crashing) What is that? (Charlotte screaming) Liam! (Gasping) Liam! Liam! Where are you? (Gasping) That's Liam. Liam! LIAM: Mom. CHARLOTTE: Liam. Mom, we got to go. That thing's everywhere. We got to go. We got to go. We got to go. Are you okay? No. My arm's broken, I think. Yeah, that's-- We're going to get you out of here, okay? LIAM: Hurry. Hurry. Aah! BAILEY: Help me. LIAM: Ow! (All straining) Stop it, stop it. It's falling. Ow. Okay, okay. It's all right. Jamie, think about what you are doing. I have to go. KYLIE: Dad, the other scrap yard was completely destroyed. Listen, there's never been a recording of ball lightning. I've got a spectrograph in the car. This is perfect timing for me to do it. But why you? You heard what they said. The only way we can prevent this is with more information. Dad... CHARLOTTE, OVER WALKIE-TALKIE: We found Liam in a junkyard. Can you hear me? (Audio crackling) Oh, God. We're at the junkyard. We need help. Will you please-- (Audio warbling) Dad, they're at the junkyard. I love you. I love you. Okay, Dad's on his way. Can you hear me? Dad's coming. (Liam groaning) (Lightning crashing) (Straining) Ow. It's too heavy. Liam's-- He's pinned under some stuff. We need something to pull him out. I got Dad's rope in the in the back. It's just my arm. It's pinned. Okay, we're going to-- It's pinned. LIAM: Where is Daddy? Here. Set my phone to stopwatch. When was the last ball lightning? I don't know. Four, maybe five minutes ago. I don't know. We got five minutes before this goes up. Come on. LIAM: You got to help. My arm, Dad. My arm. My arm. Ow! JAMIE: We'll get you out in a minute. Here. (Grunting) JAMIE: Let's go. And on three, let's pull. Megan, we need you. One, two, three. Pull! (Screaming) Go! Go! (All straining) (Thunder rumbling) We got to get out of here now. This is a hot target. The lightning will begin striking every few seconds. Let's go. We got to go. Move, move! Wait a second, wait a second. What? I think I have an idea. Dad, we have to hurry. There's so much metal here. Basically this place is one giant conductor. Look, technically, if I can contain the lightning to this specific area, it just might buy us some time to get out of here. CHARLOTTE: How? JAMIE: Well, if my theory's correct, this VDG ion generator will project a beam skyward, which will attract the lightning to it. What does that mean? This is just an experiment I was working on. But if I'm right, this generator will attract lightning directly to it. All right, what can we do? Here. Grab the ferrofluid. Open up the tabs, and dump it out about 10 feet from the truck. (Lightning crashing) Charlie, start the van. Make sure everybody gets in there. Let's go. You got to get out of here. CHARLOTTE: Let's go. What about you? We're not leaving you. I'll meet you guys at the entrance, okay? * Okay... Whew, everything set. (Electricity crackling) All right. Red, red. (Thunder crashing) (Crackling) * CHARLOTTE, OVER WALKIE-TALKIE: Kylie? You there? Mom? Mom? Kylie, honey, we're all here. Everyone's okay. Oh! We're just arriving at emergency. Liam broke his... (Audio crackling) LIAM: Hey. Hi. CHARLOTTE: Are you okay? Ow, ow. Arm. Hey, Megan. Uh... I, uh... I, uh, ahem... Thank you. Science guy. Charlie. Toughest girl I know. Never change. You're a great father. Let's get inside. Come on. Thank you. *
