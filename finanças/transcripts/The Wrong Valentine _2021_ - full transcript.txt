You weren't even born yet. I went to go see it with my friend Jen, first time I saw it. Mm-hmm. That's it for today. Really great discussion. Emily, I really appreciate your thoughts on capitalism and consumerism in the '80s. Some very insightful stuff there, Thanks, Miss Connelly. I like being here. You know, it's such a shame that more people at this school don't realize how smart and sweet you are. Maybe we should work on that? Sure, whatever you say. I should get going. Okay. See you tomorrow. Is this history club? Oh, didn't hear you come in. Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Oh, that's okay. And this was the history club. And you are? I'm David Olson. I'm new here. Oh. I'm Miss Connelly. It's nice to meet you, David Olson. Same to you too. So you say you're new here. How are things going for you so far? Lots of changes? I'm getting used to it. I just moved in with my grandma, from upstate. Now, let me guess. You're a history buff, right? Yeah, yeah, you could say that, for sure. Seems the older I get, the more fascinated I become with the past. Well, then, David, this club is perfect for you. I'm sure you're right. Now, everyone that was here today, will they be here tomorrow? Yes. Terrific. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Yes, you will. What you got there? Oh, hey. I found this old photo album in Dad's closet. Oh, I forgot those were in there. Oh, yeah. I think some of these are from before we even met. I miss him too. Em. - Yeah, Mom? - Breakfast. I'm not hungry. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. Sweetheart, are you behind on your schoolwork? No. These are just some extra-credit assignments. Oh, okay. Well, then you can take a break for five minutes and eat. Sure. What? Nothing. I just... I want you to know we're good. As far as money, I mean. Mom... Your father, God rest his soul, he made sure that both of us are very well taken care of. And I know that you like to worry about things. It's just the way you're built. And I worry too. Trust me, I do. I worry about keeping you safe and protecting you without him and... Well, you're doing a really good job so far. Thanks, sweetheart. Anyway, at the very least, I don't want you to stress yourself out about having to nail some scholarship, okay? Your education's paid for, so give yourself a break. Go out, meet some friends, have a little fun. Em, you've always been a shy girl. Don't get me wrong. It's part of your beauty. But since your father died... Your point being? That I would like to see you try a little harder with your peers, not just with the books. We can't all be high school cheerleaders, Mom. Come on, I'm not saying that you have to be like I was. You mean popular? Em, these years are gone and behind you before you know it, and they don't come back around, and there's nothing quite like them, believe me. I just want you to enjoy this time. I'll try, all right? Ooh! I heard a rumor that someone has a birthday this week. 17 million people celebrate their birthday on any given day. 800,000 in the U.S. alone, so you can probably believe that rumor. Anyway, I was thinking, how about we have a little party for it here? Small, intimate. You can invite your friends from school. Intimate would be right 'cause I have like one friend. And I adore Michelle, so have her come over. I'm just gonna get a protein bar on my way to school. Bye, Mom. Hey. So I guess my birthday's coming up in a couple of days. You guess? Happy early birthday. My mom wants me to ask you over for cake and stuff. Your mom does? Is this another guess? Michelle, do you want to come or not? I guess I could eat some cake and stuff. Good. Who is that? I don't know. He must be new. He must be. I would not forget a face like that. Oh, yeah. How could I forget? Your birthday is Valentine's Day. Yeah. I try to forget that too. - What do you mean? - It means... I've never had an actual valentine before, so I guess it's always been sort of a non-issue. Hmm. Anyways, I gotta get to history club. I'll see you later. Okay. Good morning, club. Come on in and have a seat, and let's get things started. Ah, there he is. Everyone, we have a new member to our history club. His name is David Olson. - Hey. - Hi, guys. All right, now, we all were new to something - at some point, right? - Yeah. So let's do our best to make David comfortable. Have a seat. Oh. Perfect seat for you, right next to Emily. She's super smart, and you both have a love for history. Who knows what else you might have in common? Okay. Hey. Hi. I'm David. I remember. Can you help me out with something? I could use some help. Um... I don't know. - What do you need? - The 411 on this place. Yeah, I don't know if I'm the best person to ask. I don't know about that. I find it's usually the quiet ones that pick up on everything. Um, I need to get to a meeting with my guidance counselor now. Oh, okay. Hey, would you just hang out with me for a little bit? Uh... Yeah, sure. Thanks... for being so nice to me. Sucks being the new kid. You know, it's like... Have you ever showed up to a party late? You're stone cold sober, but everyone around you's already trashed? You just feel like you missed everything. I could see that. Miss Connelly, she's cool. She's, uh... She's awesome. Remember when she said that me and you might have some things in common? Yeah, 'cause it was like 45 minutes ago. Well, let's test her theory. What are you into? Well, I clearly like to study history. History? That's my favorite subject too. What I love is that there's literally so many things to study that it's overwhelming. I know. It's amazing. If you really think about all the things that go on around us, how they all connect because of our past. Yeah, I know. I've always been a firm believer that if you don't know your history, you'll be doomed to repeat it. Well, I should go. Yeah, yeah. I'll see you soon, Emily. So you're sure now. You definitely want to major in history. I'm all in, Mrs. Stein. Okay, well, you may be in luck. There's a gentleman named Frank Phillips. He's the head of admissions at USC. Also happens to be an old college friend of mine. Oh, that's cool. Well, would you like to meet him? It would certainly give you a head start in getting into the history program. Yeah, sure. That'd be awesome. Okay. Okay, what's going on with you? You're a little bit more absent than usual today, Emily. Sorry. No, I'm here, and I would love to meet your friend. Okay. I'll set it up. Thanks again, Mrs. Stein. You're the best. Well, I'm very fond of you too, Emily. Now go on. Get back to whatever is distracting you. I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay, what is up with you? What do you mean? You're smiling way more than usual. What do you mean? See? Sorry. If it bothers you, I'll stop. Or you could just tell me what happened. Hey, Emily. Oh. Never mind. Told you I'd see you again. Looks like you were right. So are you heading home now or what? I'm heading home. Yeah. Do you drive? I drive. No, but I live pretty close, so I usually just walk. Well, I live pretty close too. You guys go ahead. I'm too busy talking to myself. Your, um, your friend Michelle, you guys like besties or what? Pretty much. She's basically the only friend I have here. Well, as of now, you're basically mine. We should grab coffee after school tomorrow. What do you say? You mean like as friends? As whatever. Just get all jacked up on caffeine and get to know each other a little better. It'll be fun, I promise. Be an historic event. Could be a scone in it for you, if you play your cards right. I know that look. Mom, jeez. I haven't seen you smile like that in quite some time. You're the second person today to tell me that. Oh, then it must be a thing. So what's got your corners up? Or should I say who? Oh, my God. Nosy much? Fine, have it your way. Look. Mm-mm! Mm! But come on, 'cause dinner's almost ready. - So is he cute? - Mom... - Is he tall? - Mom! Is he... Mom... All right. Oh, that reminds me. Did you invite Michelle over to celebrate your birthday? Em? Asked you a question. Sorry. What? Did you invite Michelle over to celebrate your birthday? Oh. Yeah, I did. She said yes. Ah, that's wonderful. Come on, what is the deal? What is his name? David. David. Okay. David. And is, uh, David coming over to celebrate your birthday too? Jeez! Can I get a mocha latte with the guy first? I don't know. As long as that's not teenage code for... Mom! Fine. I hope you're hungry. Wow. So you actually live all by yourself? In my grandma's old house. We just never got around to selling it after she passed away. And where are your parents in all of this? Silver Park Cemetery upstate. They died, too, about six months ago now. Uh, I-I'm so sorry. How did it happen? It's strange, Emily. You have a better chance of being elected the President of the United States and dying in a plane crash, but... Guess I'd be on the wrong side of that calculation. How are you doing with it? I mean, everybody just keeps telling me that "it's a process, it's a process." But I sure do miss 'em though. That's for sure. You know, my dad was definitely one of those... hands-on type of dads, you know? He's more like... He was more like my best friend. And your mom? She was just the sweetest woman in the world. You know, I'm grateful for every minute that I got to spend with them. Even though it's hard not thinking about all the times that I won't. I get it. But you know what's funny? When I really think back to it, what I miss the most, it's all of us just sitting around the dinner table. You know, eating and laughing and talking about our day. Are you okay, Emily? My father passed away too. Cancer. A year ago. I can't tell you how sorry I am to hear that. What was your dad's name? Dylan. It's the process, right? That's what they tell me. I'm glad we did this. The oldest record of a valentine being sent goes all the way back to the year 1415. It was a poem written by a French medieval duke by the name of Charles to his wife. He wrote this sweet note while he was in prison in the Tower of London, and he was just 21 years old. Excuse me! Valentines! Speaking of valentines... Sorry to disturb, Miss Connelly. I have love to give out. - Do you think, Cupid? - For those fortunate enough to have an admirer this year, secret or otherwise. Whoo! Really? Thank you, Cupid. Emily Marshall, will you accept this rose? I will. What are you doing tonight? - Hi. - Hey. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Oh, hi, Michelle! Hi, Mrs. Marshall. Oh, sweetie, thank you for joining us. Of course. I'm glad to be here. Fantastic. I have a few things to finish in the kitchen, so I will be right back, okay, girls? Okay. What's up? You look nervous. Oh, my gosh! Is that Mr. Valentine? David? I should get the door. Hey. - Hi. - Hey. I didn't think you would show up. Are you kidding? Wouldn't miss it for the world. More flowers? Oh, yeah. My mom always said that you can't be too gifted or gift too many flowers. They're beautiful. Oh... So are we blowing the candles out here or... Yes. Uh, no. Come in. Mom, this is David. David, this is my mother. And you've already met Michelle. Of course. Hi. Hi, I'm Ashley. It's great to meet you, Mrs. Marshall. It's nice to meet you too. Wow. This is a very lovely home. Oh, thank you. Oh. Wait, these are for me? Of course. Oh, God. I don't think that I've gotten flowers from anyone since... Uh, let's just say it has been a minute. Well, the minute's up. Come on in and grab a slice. It's double cheese. It's like you knew I was coming. You didn't tell me he was coming. So are you two like... Well, he hasn't tried to kiss me yet, but I think he's interested. Mm-hmm, well, are you? So how are your classes? It must have been hard to move in the middle of the year. Yeah, it's going pretty good so far. I can tell calculus is gonna kick my butt though. But Emily told me that you're like a math whiz or something. Oh, well I do know my times tables. Nine times seven, quick. 63. Wow, you're good. Thanks. Maybe you can help me out sometime. Maybe. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Emily ♪ ♪ Who's still just my little baby ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ You guys are the best. Good job. You really do have yourself a cool little family here. Yeah. I'm pretty lucky. Yeah, you could say that. Sorry your dad's not here. I'd have loved to have met him. I think he would've really liked you. I'm sure it'd be mutual. So... did you get everything you wanted today? Almost. Oh, my God. I am so sorry. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay? Look, I really like you, okay? But... My mom told me to take these things really slow. She was always very demure about these kind of things. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It seems like I would have had a lot in common with her too. My dad too. Trust me. Here. I should probably get going, okay? Happy birthday, my valentine. So? Very cute, very sweet. And those flowers? Oh! Tell me about it. See what happens when you put yourself out there? Your very first valentine. Mmm! - What can I help with? - Uh, the chairs. You put the chairs back. I'll take care of the rest. ♪ Happy birthday ♪ Okay. The cake was so good. Oh, sweetie, I'm so glad you liked it. I know you love strawberries. You think I can maybe have another slice before bed? - Or should I wait? - Let's have it for breakfast. - Okay. - You got everything? All right. Is everything all right, baby? Yeah, I'm great. Okay. Good night, sweetie. Good night. What the hell? Hey. David, it's 7:00 in the morning. What are you doing here? I thought we could get some breakfast before school. Being spontaneous. I thought you'd think it was cute. I do. It's just... I'm a little surprised you'd show up out of the blue. Oh, well, I sent you a text. You did? Yeah. Oh. I-I just didn't see it. I'd never lie to you, Emily. Well, what about last night? What about it? I thought we had a good time. We did, and then I caught you standing outside my house after we said good night. You caught me? What? You weren't? I sent out an email like right before I left. I mean, I'm not good at walking and texting. You probably saw me right after I sent it, and then I walked home. That's it. So... eggs, bacon, side of toast. What do you say? I say... I'll see you at school, David. Okay? Okay. And when I looked out the window, he was just standing on the sidewalk, staring at my house. Same as the night before? Yep. Yep, that's weird. What did he say? That he wanted to take me to breakfast before school. And he did send me a text. I just didn't see it. What about last night? Something about an email that he remembered he had to get out and that I saw him after he sent it. Well, that kinda makes sense, right? Yeah, it does, I guess. Come on. A super cute guy wants to take you to breakfast, and you're finding reasons to complain. You're right. I should just be happy that he wants to see me so much. - Mm-hmm! - Right. Hey. Hey. Okay, so listen. I feel bad about what happened this morning, but I've been having a lot of fun getting to know you, and I don't want to push it. If I don't feel bad about it, then you shouldn't either. Okay, okay. - Okay, who is that? - What? Texting right now. Who is it? No one, David. - Okay, fine. Let me see. - Hey! See? Why are you being so weird? You're the one being weird. Okay, fine, then show me the text. It's Michelle. My God. What's the matter with you? Sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Yeah, okay. Hey, don't walk away from me like that. You're embarrassing me. Emily, David, is everything okay over there? Yeah, Miss Connelly. I was just leaving. Okay. Hey! Hey, it's Emily, right? Mm-hmm. I'm Pete. We're in the same chemistry class. Okay. Think I can get a copy of your notes from yesterday? I was at home sick, and it's like the last class I want to fall behind in. If you can just scan them and email them to me, that'd be epic. Why not? What's your email? There you go. Got it. Thanks. I really appreciate it. - David! - We get into one argument, and you're already talking to another guy. You can go now. So can you. - Emily, Emily, Emily. - What? I know I was wrong with the texting thing, okay? And this is how you make up for it? By pushing some poor kid that's asking for my chemistry notes? But how was I supposed to know that? - Try asking me. - I said I was sorry! Hey! Hey, what is going on here? Emily? I'm all right, Mrs. Stein. I don't know you. Hi, I'm David Olson. David. You must be new here. Because around here, we don't really take kindly to students hassling other students. I wasn't hassling her. We're in the same history class, and I had a question. Is that true, Emily? I said I was fine. See? Go to class, David. Okay. Whatever you say, Mrs. Stein. I'll call you tomorrow. Sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me about this guy? Not really. Next year at this time, you're going to be in college, right? That's the plan. Well, part of that plan should be focusing on getting into the school that you deserve. You're right. You know, we all have a time in our life when we have to step up and take control. This may be your time. Well, I have good news. I heard from my friend at USC, and he said he'd be delighted to meet with you. Really? That'd be great. Well, I'll let you know when it's all set up, but until that time, focus. Janet? Oh, Janet. Hey! What's going on? I just wanted to have a quick chat with you about one of your history club students, David Olson. What about David? I don't like him. Okay. You do? Yes, I do. I think he's a nice young man. Well, I just got in the middle of a heated argument between that nice young man and Emily Marshall. And? Come on! You know these kids these days. One day they're together. Next day, they're not. Yeah, you're right about that. And honestly, I'm happy to see Emily opening up a little bit. Yeah. No, I want that for her too. So what's the problem? I don't know, like he just gives me the creeps. Hey. Hey, Jane, how's it going? Good, good. You have a visitor. - I do? - He's in your office. I didn't think that I had any appointments today. David? What are you doing here? Hey, Ashley, I was just in the area, and I thought that I'd pop in. Pop in? Uh, how did you even know where I worked? Oh, Emily told me that you were an estate planner. It wasn't too hard to find you at all. Shouldn't you be in school right now? What are you doing here? I just wanted to say thank you for accepting me in your home the other day. Really meant the world to me. Oh, um, you're welcome. It's been really great getting to know you and your daughter. How are you doing, Ashley? Fine. See, Emily also told me about Dylan. And if I'm being honest, it really hit me hard when I heard about it. Why is that? I don't know. You know, it's just the thought of Emily having to grow up without her father, and you having to grow older without your husband. It's all really sad. You're right, it is sad. I'm sure it gets pretty lonely too. Anyways, I have some things I gotta get to, so I'll get out of your hair. I'll see you later, Ashley. Hey there, Ashley. Hi, Miss Connelly. Thank you for taking my call. You're welcome. What can I do for you? I wanted to talk to you about a friend of Emily's. Let me guess. David Olson? Yes. Hmm. Someone else was just asking me about him. Why are you? He just stopped by my office out of nowhere and, um... Oh? Why'd he do that? He said he wanted to thank me for having him over for Emily's birthday the other night. Well, maybe he shouldn't have just dropped in like that, but that doesn't sound too sketchy. Uh, I-I guess not. I just, um... He just seems like a bit too much for me, and, um, and maybe for Emily. And you're her favorite teacher, so I thought that I would just get your thoughts on it. Well, honestly, David seems like a nice guy. You should have seen the look on Emily's face when he gave her a valentine rose. It was pure bliss. Yeah, um... No, trust me, I am so happy that Emily is opening up more. I'm just, um... Being a good mother? Listen, I'll keep my good eye on it, and if something should happen, I promise I'll let you know. That would be great, Miss Connelly, thank you. Call me Janet. And you're welcome. Janet. You raised a very special young lady, Mrs. Marshall, and clearly, David agrees. I can't tell you how excited I was when I heard that you agreed to come out with me tonight. Look, I know it's been weird, considering everything that's been going on lately, but hey, you know, it's been weird for me too. But you know what? There's something here. I can feel it. I can feel it, and I know you can feel it. I don't know, but if you ask me, I think it's time we did something about it. I feel like crap. That's gotta be the worst review I've ever gotten. You know what I mean. Why don't we just try again, okay? David, Emily is my best friend. Hey, she's my friend too. But is that really what you wanna think about right now? Why are you smiling? Because I had a good time. I... That's your idea of a good time, hooking up with the guy that your best friend has been talking to? - But you just... - , Emily! You gotta be the dumbest person I've ever met. I'm a guy, and we'll do anything we want, if it gets us closer to what we want. I wouldn't have done it if I'd known you'd be... You're not gonna tell Emily about this, are you? Screw you. Not quite. We had fun, didn't we? Hey. Hey. Did you, uh, did you get my gift today? I sure did. I've been reading it all night. Awesome. Yeah, I thought I knew everything about the fall of the Romans, but this? I guess I never really thought of it that way. Yeah, that's like my favorite thing about it too. So... where are you right now? Um, just at home, thinking about you. Hey, Emily, about earlier today, are we good? We're good. Well, good night then, Emily. Good night, David. What happened? Are you okay? It's all right. Whatever it is, you can just say it. Please don't hate me. Michelle, I would never hate you. Just tell me what's going on. I hooked up with David last night. What? I hooked up with David last night. What? Emily, listen, please. How how could you do this to me? I swear, I... I finally get attention from a guy, my first valentine in my whole life. I know, I know. You're supposed to be my best friend. - I am. - So why take this away from me? I mean, I was jealous. I made a mistake. You sure did. Emily, I'll make it up to you. What can I do? You can get out of my house. What? I mean it. Get out. Hey, what's going on with all the yelling in here? Michelle! What happened? My ex-best friend hooked up with David last night. - What? I thought that... - So did I. Oh, honey. Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. How did you get in here? Emily. Hey, why don't we go get that breakfast now? How about you never talk to me again? What's wrong? I thought we were all good. And I thought you were out clearing your head last night. Well, I was. Michelle just dropped by. Oh. So you won't even kiss me, but you'll make out with my best friend all night? Emily, why don't you just let me explain? Hey! - Good morning, Ashley. - You need to go now, David. Look at that. You're starting to sound like the man of the house. You kids, you better get off my lawn! But there is no man in the house, is there? - What did you just say to me? - Nothing. I'm sure you miss having all that alpha energy around you. All right, David, you know what? It's boundary time. No more coming by here uninvited, no more popping in at my office. As a matter of fact, if you're not off my property in exactly one minute, I'm calling the police. You know what? It really is a nice house. Go now. Okay. I'll leave. Oh, Emily, I'm glad to run into you. I was about to come find you this morning. Oh, really? Is it about your friend from USC? It is. He can meet you after school for coffee, if you're available. I'll be there. Thanks again for your recommendation. Of course. Who knows? Maybe you'll be teaching there someday. I'd love that. Hey, aren't you supposed to be in history club right now? I'm... Uh, I'm avoiding someone. That boy I saw you arguing with. David. What's going on with that? He's a mess. He showed up at my house. He's getting jealous out of nowhere, even though we just started hanging out and... other stuff I don't feel like talking about. Okay. It's okay, Emily. Just focus, okay? And don't forget about that appointment this afternoon. Mm-hmm. Hey, David, David. How's it going, Mrs. Stein? - Oh, me? I'm great. - Glad to hear. One of my students has a problem though, and that problem is you. You're not talking about Emily, are you? You know that I am. Okay, look. It's just some hallway drama. You were young once. I'm sure you understand. Wait, you don't have a little crush on Emily, do you? She told me about this little meeting you and your buddy are setting up at USC. What's with all the extra help with Emily going to college? That's exactly my job. And intimidating the man in her life, is that your job too? Listen, Emily has much bigger things to focus on than fights with some stupid high school jerk, all right? You need to leave her alone. You can't tell me what to do. I'm 18. I have rights. Okay, if by rights you mean the right to be tried as an adult for harassing a minor, then yes, you're correct. You need to stop messing with her and her family or... Or what? Or I will call the authorities. I'm getting pretty sick of no one being able to handle their own problems anymore. Do not try me, David. You got me. I'm not looking to cause any trouble. I care about Emily, okay? And if you think that it's best for her that I leave her alone, well, I will. You really mean it? Of course. Okay, okay, well, then I am glad we had this chat. Me too. So tell me why you like history. Well, Mr. Phillips, I guess I'd say... I mean, there's so much to learn about so many things, it's a little overwhelming, but that's kind of the fun of it all, isn't it? Agreed. The truth is, it's amazing how little we actually know about the things going on around us and how it all connects us to the past. That sounds familiar. Hey. Uh... What are you doing here? Well, I was just in the area, and I saw that you were having coffee with... Who's this fella now? Mr. Phillips. He is the admissions interviewer from USC. Oh, awesome! How you doing? My name is David. Frank. So how's our girl here doing? Uh, she was doing just fine. Can you please just go? Yeah, sure, I can go. First, can you just consider one little thing for me? And what's that? I don't know if Emily here mentioned it, but I, too, would like to major in history next year. Uh, she actually hadn't mentioned you at all. Well, she's a bit shy, this one, so I'll just ask myself. Since we're both planning on attending the same college, would you be open to accepting both of us into your highly esteemed institution? Look... I have no idea what this is, but I'm gonna give you two a minute. And hopefully when I return, we can get back to our meeting. Thank you, Frank. And hey! Don't forget to wash your hands. I like him. How did you know where I was? Because I followed you. Duh. I asked you nicely this morning to leave me alone. A... It wasn't that nice. And second... Not until we talk about what happened with Michelle. Now, I know what she told you. Just go! Jeez. All you had to do was ask. Enjoy the rest of your meeting with Frank. I'm so excited to get my acceptance letter. Hey, Frank, how did it go today? Didn't I tell you that Emily's... What? Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. What kind of things was he saying? Okay, all right, that's it. I have had it. Clearly, I didn't get through to this kid. I promise you, I'm gonna take care of it. Okay, all right. Listen, thank you, Frank. I'll talk to you soon. David! Hi, Mrs. Stein. What, are you following me? No. I just wanted to see how USC was looking for next year. Was that him on the phone right now? Tell me, how'd I come off? Like someone trying to ruin somebody else's opportunity. That's not what I'm trying... Okay, listen, all right? You just shut up... No, you listen to me! Emily has been getting the breaks her whole life, and I'm getting pretty sick of it. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about the perfect house, the perfect parents, the perfect life! Okay, all right! Enough, David! This stops right here. And tomorrow I'm gonna go to the principal, and we're gonna discuss your future around here. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? You know, pathetic, embarrassed, self-loathing. Pick one. Just one? It's okay, Michelle. I'm not mad at you anymore. You're not? I know it's not your fault. It's him. It's David. Ah, facts! This guy is crazy. What is with him? I have no idea, but for some reason, he's made it his mission in life to make mine miserable. And he used me to help him do it, and I let him. He's a charmer. Emily, I am so, so sorry. It will never happen again. I know. Oh, my God. Did you guys hear what happened? - Hear what? - Mrs. Stein. - What about her? - She's dead. I-I can't believe she's dead. I just heard. Why is it that such bad things happen to such good people? My parents. Your father. I'm so sorry, Emily. I know that you and Mrs. Stein were very close. Just another victim of random violence. Do you need a hug? Move, please. I can't. Oh, my God, honey, what happened now? - You look like someone died. - Someone did. Wait, what are you talking about? Who died? Mrs. Stein. What? Are you kidding? Someone robbed her in a parking lot outside her car last night, and then they stabbed her, Mom. Oh, my God, that's... She really believed in me. I-I know. And now she's dead. Oh, sweetie, come here. I'm so sorry. Did you, um... Did you see David today? Besides class, I mean? Yes. So he's not leaving you alone? No. Okay, look, honey, I think that we should talk to the police and see what they have to say. I don't want to talk to some police officer, Mom. - I just want him to go away. - Shh, okay. It's gonna be okay. How long have you been out here spying on us? Hi, Ashley. I would tell you to call me "Mrs. Marshall," but I want this to be the last conversation that we ever have. No, what's the matter? Is this about Mrs. Stein? I know. I've been thinking about it all day. It's such a tragedy. I want to talk to your parents. - That's gonna be difficult. - Why? 'Cause they're dead. I didn't know that. Yeah, you know, it's actually... It's actually not an easy subject matter. I'm sure you understand. Look, David, I am sorry about your parents. - Yeah, me too. - But you need to listen to me. I don't know what kind of ridiculous game you think you're playing with my daughter, but it comes to an end right now. You know, it's times like this I bet you wish Dylan was still alive. I am perfectly capable of handling someone like you. - Someone like me? - Yeah. A little boy. Oh, you're overflowing with hidden anger and artificial confidence, and you're trying to control or hurt someone else to make up for your own pathetic life. But yeah, at the end of the day, you are just a little boy. You know, Ashley, I already told your daughter this. Told her what? That it's amazing how little we actually know about the things that are going on around us. What's that supposed to mean? It means I can promise... this won't be our last conversation. Leave my daughter alone. Goodbye, Ash. You know, Emily, I just don't get it. Why are you being like this? Why are you pretending like the last week didn't happen? Like I imagined the cake we ate, the laughs we shared. I'm your first valentine, for... sake, Emily! And I know it can't be about that blowhard Stein. I mean, I get it. The death was tragic. But these things happen all the time. You gotta get over it! And I know it can't be about her friend from USC 'cause it sounds like you were using my words to get in, so I mean, I just don't get it, Emily! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know, the thing is, Emily, we're connected. We'll always be connected, so why don't you stop being a bitch and call me back? So why don't you stop being a bitch and call me back? Emily, this guy is a total freak! How are you not like freaking out right now? Because he's just screwing with me, Michelle, and I wanna know the reason why. What are you gonna do? I need to figure out everything I can about David Olson. I mean, there has to be some explanation why he's doing this, why he thinks we have this deep connection. What do you think it could be? Who knows? Maybe I remind him of someone who broke his heart? Something like that. But if I can figure this out, then maybe this all will finally stop. Are you sure you just shouldn't let your mom handle it? Mrs. Stein told me that at some point in our lives, we have to make the decision to step up and take control of it. I think this might be my time to do that. What happened to shy Emily? You sure are a lot braver than I would be. Thanks. But I could still use your help for one thing. What? - Miss Harrison! - What? Come quick. There are two kids fighting. - What? Where? - Outside. Hurry! Okay. Just breathe. There you are. I don't understand, Miss Harrison. They were just here. Okay, sure. Thanks, Miss Harrison. Yes! Let's go. Not much here. "Awaiting medical records." Hmm. Washington High School. Good morning. Hi. I, um, I was hoping to get some information on one of your former students. I was hoping you could help me. Who is this? My name is Emily. I am a friend of his. I was just wondering... I'm sorry, Emily. We can't give out any information regarding our students, past or present. I understand that, I do, but this is super important. And that's all well and good, miss, but... His name is David Olson. What? Why did you get quiet? I-I really can't. Please. There's nothing I can tell you about David Olson or any other student who went to Washington High School. Good day, miss. ! What... The good news is the damage is mostly cosmetic. Bad news is it looks like someone really wanted to get under your skin. I called the police. - Good. - Should be someone here soon. Thank you. That is the right thing to do. No problem, boss. You know, Jane, uh, why don't you take the rest of the day off, and I will handle this. You got it. So, Miss Marshall, do you have any idea who could have done this? Maybe someone you had a beef with? Angry ex-client or friend? Anything like that? There is this one kid at my daughter's school. His name is David Olson. And he and my daughter have been going out, sort of. I don't really know what that is, but... You honestly would be surprised at what people are capable of. That includes teenagers. But why in the world would he trash a room like this? We had a little, um, confrontation yesterday, and, uh, I know that he knows where my office is. Do you have any evidence? Nothing concrete, but I... - Miss Marshall... - But I... Unfortunately, I can't question him without any proof. But I will look into it a bit, see what I find. Thanks. I would appreciate that. You're welcome. Oh, and if anything changes, he cause any more problems, here's my card. Give me a call. I'll be in touch. Your mom's pretty, but where is your father? How long have you been watching us? No way. "David's time with us is almost done." He's come a long way in a short time. His breakdown from his mother's suicide "is quite understandable." Suicide? "Despite her extensive abuse, she was the only parent he's ever known." That's... That's impossible. That's what he was talking about all along. We have the same father. No, no, no. I see you. Now you see me. Emily. Mom, where are you? I just got home. Where are you? - I'll be there soon. - Good, okay. I left you a message. I've gotta tell you something. Same. Excuse me, Miss Connelly? Yes, I'm Miss Connelly. Sorry to bother you. I'm Detective Rick. I was in the office inquiring about a student who goes here. And who is that? Emily Marshall. They say the two of you are pretty close. Yes, we are. I gave her ride home last year when she was sick. - Is she all right? - As far as I know. But her mother's office was trashed today. - I'm so sorry to hear that. - Yeah. But how can I help? Well, you see, the thing is, Mrs. Marshall seems to think another student had something to do with it. Let me guess. Do you mean David Olson? I do. You know, I have been hearing his name from too many people lately. And you know when they say there's smoke... It leads to fire. Indeed, it does. Let's go discuss this in my office. Okay. Mom? - Where are you? - Emily! A mental institution, Emily? Is that true? He had a breakdown after his mother died. When was this? He basically just got out. - I'm calling the police. - Wait, hold on. There's more. What more? His mom didn't just die. She killed herself. And there's more. Emily, just tell me, please. His mother was Dad's ex-girlfriend. What... What are you talking about? At his house, I found this old picture on his laptop of her and Dad. It was the same one I found in Dad's photo album the other day. - They were definitely together. - No, that can't be. And I found a copy of Dad's obituary on his computer. - That can't be. - Mom, look at them. There's definitely a resemblance. I'm calling the police. Mom! Emily! Ashley! Let me in! It's okay, Em. It's gonna be okay. Hi, this is Ashley Marshall, the one... Yes! I need someone at my house right now. Emily! We need to talk, ladies. I know you know that! David, you need to go. I've called the police. How could you do that to me? We're family. I'm the blood of your blood, for crying out loud! Leave us alone! Emily, what did I tell you the first day we met? If you don't know your history... You're doomed to repeat it. Exactly. Now here we are. Now let me in! - They're coming. - Thank God. You two disappoint me so damn much! I can't believe that David is my stepson. I mean, if your father... - If we had known... - I know. I swear, if we had known, we would've tried to help him. Of course you would've. But I just don't understand why Carla wouldn't tell Dylan about his own son. Did Dad hurt her? Yeah. I suppose he did. Please tell me that you guys never... Mom. He never even tried to kiss me. At first, I didn't understand why, but I do now. So what now? Well, the police have reached out to the doctor from the mental health facility, and he should be coming to town tomorrow to collect his patient. So like what happens to him? Em, David is a very disturbed young man, but he is still your father's child, so we are going to do everything we can to make sure he gets the help that he needs. Okay, ladies, just let you know, I did another check of the house. There's no one in here or skulking the area at all, okay? Appreciate that. You're welcome. We do have officers out looking for David, but if it's okay with the two of you, I'm gonna stay guard outside for a little while, just in case. Just in case sounds good. Works for me. I'll be out back if you guys need me. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Why didn't you tell me you were gonna investigate David? You did tell me to put myself out there, didn't you? - Girl! - Seriously. I think I just needed to take some more control of my life. I'm proud of you. I love you too. Are you tired, baby? Exhausted. - How about a mocha latte? - Perfect. - I'm gonna be in my bedroom. - Okay. - Mom? - Yeah. I'm glad this week is finally over. Oh, me too, baby. Me too. The prodigal son returns. You know, I always wanted to say that, but I guess "stepson" works as well. I think it's time that we go inside, we have ourselves a little family chat. And hey, if you even think about calling for help... I'll kill everyone in this house and not think twice about the mess. Please, please don't hurt my daughter. Always trying to be the consummate mother. Bravo, Ashley. Let's go. Now, where is my step-sis? Mom? Where are you? Emily! You're just in time. No. Emily, why don't you come have a seat? Are you gonna tie me up too. No. I'm not worried about you. But I am gonna tell you exactly what I told your mom. You even think about trying to escape, and there will be three dead bodies here. Would you look at your face! Okay. You guys deserve an explanation. Both of you. First thing that I'd like to say is that I really do wish that you were my mom. I imagine how different my life would be without the random beatings and the scent of brandy wafting off of her breath as she tells me over and over and over again that I will be a disappointment just like my father. Our father. It seems that I just reminded her too much of her great romance. She was hurt badly when he left, so she hurt me... badly... and often. But despite all of that, no matter how crazy that it sounds, she still loved him. When she found out that he passed away, she lost it. But you know what? She finally told me my father's name, where he lived, and told me all about the little family that he made after they broke up. And after all that, she killed herself. With this. You know, I was gonna use this to kill Mrs. Stein. But I decided to save this for just this occasion. So I stabbed her right in the back of my knife. It was you. She should've focused on staying out of my business. I can't believe you killed her. Would you let me finish what I'm saying, please?! I'm sorry. To get back to what I was saying, after all that, I experienced what they called "a nervous breakdown," and they sent me all the way to North Pines, so they could straighten me out. Worked like a charm, didn't it? Because I never told them that I knew my father's name. Our father. Look, David... I understand you're upset. You were abused, and I'm sorry, but why are you doing this to us? Can you put yourself in my shoes for one second? Look at this house. Look at your mother. You got everything, and I got kicked like a dog. I deserved better, damn it! You know, here's a funny story. One night, she got so drunk, she took this thing out. You know what she did? She threatened to put a bullet in my head! 14 years old. Isn't that hilarious? See, once I got out of those North Pines, all I could think about was you two. So I tracked you down, and I followed you. When I saw the love you shared and the kind of home that you lived in, I despised you! I wanted to be the reason that you felt bad, the way that I felt bad! So I made you fall for me, care for me, so that I could leave you empty. Empty the way that I felt every day of my life! So I enjoyed pushing your buttons until I let you in on my little secret. Because all of this... is just a foreplay. 'Cause everything leads to tonight... because I never got one of those dinners around the dinner table that I said I did. But I'm gonna get one. Just one. What does that mean, David? Wait. You said they were gonna find three dead bodies. I know that it's over. There's no way that I'm going back to North Pines, which is the only possible way that I can get out of this. So I've decided to take matters into my own hands, and I'm choosing to get off at this station tonight. David, please! Is there something you'd like to say, Mom? Yes! Yes! Let's hear it. David, I am so sorry about everything that happened to you. Everything. And I promise you, if Dylan and I had known about you, if we knew where you were, we would've helped you your whole life. It would have been different, I swear to you. But you don't have to do this. You can let her go. Because it was my fault Dylan left your mom. I'm the one you can hate. Hate me. Hate? Mom, I don't hate you. I love you. This has been the happiest day of my life. Really? Really. Emily, run! Emily, why don't you... Mom! You're no better than she is. Em, baby... I can't let you ruin this for me! You know what? We'll always have history, right? Don't move, David. Or what? I'll kill you. My funny valentine. Do it already. Do it, Emily! Shoot me! Get behind me. Oh, good lord. I just wanted to make sure that you two were okay. Is he dead? I sure hope not. Emily... it looks like you picked the wrong valentine. Okay. Hi, Emily. Honey, it's okay, it's okay. He's gone. David is gone. He can't hurt us anymore, okay?
