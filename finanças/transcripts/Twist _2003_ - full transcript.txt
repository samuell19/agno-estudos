TWIST What time is it? Almost 5:30. Why? I got to go. Can I have a kiss goodbye? Hey, Dodge. Morning. See you later, sweetie. OK. Bye, guys. Thanks, Mom. How so work last night? It was fine. Better than the previous night? Yes. Jesus. All right. Ugh. Oh, yeah. I've got-- I've got to, uh, pick up some take-out. No you don't. Yes, I do. We're not serving take-out before later. And, uh, you're not picking it up. What the fuck are you talking about? Um, I am too. I-- Should I call-- should I call Fagin? Call him. Call him. I swear to god, I'm-- I'm picking it up. Hey, please give it to me. I promise I will take it right home. I'm sorry. Come on. Nancy, I had a hard night. Was it that car from Quebec? I don't know what you're talking about. Hasn't this car with Quebec plates on it, driving by you all the time-- take your coffee at least. OK, it's clean. Adam, it's clean, thanks. Junkie, stop. Go to bed. Hey, Dodge. How's it going? Why did you tell Nancy? What are you talking about? About the fucking car. Why did you tell her? What car? The Quebec car, the car I told you about. Dodge, let go. I can't breathe. You guys want to shut the fuck up? I'm trying to sleep. I'm sorry about telling her, man. I-- I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I've had Johns look at me for weeks before they decide to talk to me. When I tell you something, just forget it. Shut your fucking face, Noah. Mind your own business. Fuck you, Charlie. Sorry I choked you. Hi. Can I just get a tuna sandwich and a large coffee, glass of water, please. Want a doughnut with that? No, just the sandwich. For a mere $0.25 more, you can get a doughnut with that. Yeah, the doughnut, I don't want it. Just the sandwich, please. Hey. Want a cigarette? No, thanks. Make up your mind. - Well? - No. And I'm cold. I'm bored. Hey, check it out. Well, fuck off. You have it? Hey, hey, you want to do this? No, you go ahead. I'm gonna do this. - Hey, Bill said we-- - What? Are you going to tell him? Go do this. I'll be back in 10 minutes. Moon goddess. I don't know. Four letter word for chair. - Seat. - Ah. Hey, want some coffee? I need to, uh, use the bathroom. Make sure he gets back to work soon. I'm sorry, Bill. I didn't mean to be checking up on you. I just-- I-- I just wanted to know if you wanted some supper waiting or some tea or something. OK, I'm sorry. Tea? OK. Well, I'll-- I'll-- make it. I'll leave it up. And-- and you just wake me, and I'll make it after for you. All right, I'll see you later. Oh. OK. So then I'll see you real soon. All right, then. Bye-bye. Feeling better? Yeah. I really had to go. Fagin went home? Shouldn't you be working now? It's Tuesday, for Christ's sake. Don't fucking check up on me. Well, Bill just called. He said he's coming down here real soon, so-- - When? Soon? - Yeah. And that was just him on the phone? Yeah. He says he's coming down here? That's what he said. Oh, shit. I just don't think he's be pleased to find you sitting here. Fuck. It's dead out there. Look, I don't care what you do. I just don't think you want to be here when Bill gets back. - That's all. - Yeah, no shit. Look, come back in an hour if you want. My shift will be over and he'll be gone by then. All right. - Bye. Say hi for me. - Yeah. Shit. Dodge, you want this one? Dodge? Fuck this. Yeah, what a surprise. When's the last time you fucking worked, Dodge? Man, I don't care. But Bill's going to cut your rations. Can I just get a cup of coffee, please? Thanks. Hey, you're still here, huh? Yeah. - Mind if I sit down? - Yeah, sure. - It's cold out there. - Yeah. You must be bored out of your mind, man. How long you been here? I don't know. What time is it? It's like, uh, 11:30, quarter to 12:00. Then about five or six hours, I guess. You should have found a place with free refills. Yeah. You live around here? No, not really. I just, um, I sort of ran away. Listen, um, I don't know if you're interested. But, uh, do you need a place to crash tonight? Really? Yeah, man. I'm Dodge. - I'm Oliver. - Hey. So you were freaked out by Kingston? No, not freaked out. But I hadn't been in the city since I was really young. And I don't know, it might sound stupid, but I wasn't used to being around all those people. So what, are you from Napanee? No, actually, not too far from there. The first-- the first foster parents I had lived on a farm near Quebec. So it was just north of there. And they had this golden retriever that they used to keep tied up out back and never feed. And I guess one day somebody noticed how sick the dog was because these people from the Animal Protection Agency came and they took him away. And then, like, two days later, child welfare came for me because they figured if these people couldn't take care of a dog, then they probably couldn't take care of me either, you know. But actually, they were really nice to me. Fucked up. And then the family-- yeah. And then the family after that I was with for five years. And, uh, that was a town right outside of Napanee. But they already had, like, six kids, so they just pretty much ignored me. Then they decided they didn't want anymore kids. So-- and then the-- the family I just left, uh, I was only there for a few months. He is an undertaker and I was helping in his shop. And he made me sleep in a coffin. And that was in Kingston. Have you only had coffee today? Hey. Nancy, this is Oliver. Oliver, Nancy. Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Want to eat something? Anything you want, man. What are you still doing here? Isn't-- where's Betsy? Late. He's come and gone, though. Good. Could I just get a hamburger and fries, please? Sure. Hey, wake up. Hamburger, fries. - Want some water with that? - Yeah. Water, please. - Thank you. - This is on you, right? That's right. - So are you new in town? - Yeah. My mom was from here, but she's dead. Oh, I'm sorry. That's OK. It was a long time ago. I lost my mom when I was young, too. Oh yeah? Really? I didn't know that. She died when I was four, so it was just me and my dad. You don't have any brothers or sisters? No. I always wanted one, though. Yeah, me too. Do you got any brothers or sisters, Dodge? Oh, you know what? Let's-- let's get that to go. You look kind of tired. OK. I'm just going to go to the bathroom first. Sure. Upstairs to your right. Thank you. Thanks. What? He looks very open. He does. He seems very nice. He does seem very nice, yeah. Take it easy on the take-out, will you? Don't be a hypocrite. Forget it. Probably hasn't eaten in days anyway. All right. I can still use some tip. Huh. OK. - Oh, Fagin, you scared me. - Sorry. What are you doing here. Oh, I just had to come by and talk to Bill, and he said you were late. Oh, yeah, there was a bit of a kerfuffle about shifts at the diner. Well, I just wanted to make sure you got home OK. I'm fine. Uh, have a good sleep. - You too. - See you tomorrow. Sweet dreams. It's right up here. Let me just go in by myself real quick, OK? I should let them know that I'm bringing someone home. - Is that cool? - Yeah, sure. OK - Fagin? - Yeah. Hey. I just wanted to tell you. - Listen. - Why ain't you out working? Listen, I'm trying to tell you. I not-- You think I don't know when you're not out fucking working? That's nothing compared to what you got coming from Bill. Jesus Christ. I'm trying to explain to you. I found a kid. What are you talking about? I mean I-- I've-- I brought a kid home to show you. Where is he? He's right outside. He's-- he's beautiful. He-- he looks like a David. Wait a minute. Come here. Look at you. You're all bloody. - Stop, that's disgusting. - Well, bring him in. Hi, I'm Oliver. - Nice to meet you, Oliver. - Nice to meet you too. Told Oliver here he could stay the night, if that's all right with you. Well, of course it's all right with me. We wouldn't want him sleeping on a bench. Hey, where's everybody else? I don't know, probably out partying or something. - Here. - Thank you. Thank you so much for this. Yeah, don't worry about it. Just get some rest. You can thank me again over breakfast or something. Dodge, can I see you for a minute before you go to bed? OK, I'll be right there. - Not bad. - Told you. - Think he'll work? - Yeah, I think he will. Well, he better. Go get some rest. You don't want me to go back out? Well, you have to take him out for breakfast in the morning. Dodge, you did real good today. Bill will be pleased. Charlie, wait. Where have you been? Sorry, Bill kept me longer than I thought. I fucking hate that guy. Really? 'Cause I love him. Don't make me feel worse about this, you asshole. It's worth it. How was work? I don't know. Haven't been to the strip in a few hours. - Is that a good idea? - Yeah, Noah will cover for me. I mean, I told him I wanted to be with my girlfriend anyways. You told him? Charlie, what the fuck were you thinking? - Relax. - No. If Bill finds out-- I know. Charlie, I'm not just worried about me here. I know. - Hey, Dodge. - What? Who's in your bed? - Who's asleep in your bed? - What time is it? It's like 8:30, man. You got a smoke? No. Ugh. Who's in my bed? Uh, Oliver, who's a new kid I found last night. - He gonna work? - Probably. - It's, uh, 8.30? - Something like that. [INAUDIBLE]. Hey, you're up bright an early. - Where's Dodge? - He's in the bathroom. Betsy got to work late last night, so-- You all right? Fine. How was your night? Did you get a good night's sleep? - So you from Toronto? - Nope. So where you from? Not Toronto. So what do all the guys you live with do? Well, we make really good money. We live in a really comfortable place. - Yeah. - Well, you saw it. You know. And, uh, you know, it's-- it's not the best place. But I think it's pretty fucking good, considering the alternatives. Right. Well, potential alternatives, you know. Because, I mean, this city can fuck you up. You know, you come here thinking one thing, and so-- so we hustle. What do you mean? Like, we're hustlers. You know, like loose woman. You mean, uh, hookers, right? Yeah. OK. So, uh, you know, that's it. That's what we do. I mean, it's not the best. But it's-- it's cool by me, you know? Right. I bet guys hit on you all the time, huh? Uh, sometimes, I guess. Will you show me how to do it? What? You know, like show me how? Well, yeah. Of course, man. Someone will be there with you. Yeah. Will you be there with me, though? Yeah, yeah. I'll be there. OK. Hey. Come in. He's not here. Do you want herbal tea or regular? Regular. So what happened? You want sugar? What happened? You want sugar? Yeah. Hey, the new boy's in. Oliver? Yep. Hey, faggot, get the fuck away from Dodge's shit. Do you want him to fucking kill you? - I'm just taking a needle. - Don't take it from Dodge. But you actually might have to go into the room to work by yourself. - Will I be safe? - Well, you'll be protected. Believe me, no one messes with Bill. Am I gonna meet him? - Eventually. - OK. Growth opportunity in the US-- oh, in the US-- for Pizzaville franchise located in busy plaza. So what's the new kid's name again? Oliver. You want a pizza place? You want to sell a pizza place? Does he have a crush on you? Is Dodge gonna get a girlfriend? Speaking of girlfriends, where the fuck is your mystery woman that we've heard so much about? Aren't you guys supposed to pack it up to Yellowknife or something soon? Shut up, Dodge. No, really. Have you ever seen this girl? No. I'm seeing her later. When later, man? We're going to work. Why the fuck do you guys care? Diner. - Relax, man. - Hi, honey. No, I'm not working late tonight. So I'll be home-- I'm not talking like that. I'm just saying that it's not my fault because Betsy didn't show up again tonight. So-- don't say that, Bill. No, I'm not trying to-- OK, I'm sorry. Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Um, will you come by with the de-- OK. Um, I'll call him. I don't mind. I'll-- sure. OK, I'll talk to you later. Bye. I love you. Everything all right? What would you do if it wasn't? What's up your ass? Stupid prick. You're the stupid prick, faggot. You know what the problem with this street is? Too many fucking faggots who work here. - That's the problem. - Hey, grow up. Christ. Don't make a fucking problem here, Charlie. I don't have a problem with you getting in my fucking face all the time. Hey, Oliver. Getting psyched yet? Yeah, I guess. Don't worry about shit like that, because they're harmless. - Hey, you want to play? - Yeah. - Got a car? - No. All right, come this way. Oliver. All right, here's the deal. I'm just here to keep an eye out. I won't get in the way. Fine. - What do you want? - I want to blow him. That's 30. All right. I'm just going to go wait around the corner, OK? Uh, excuse me. You're not gonna-- you're not gonna watch? I mean, you can, if you want to. That's not for me, buddy. That costs extra. How much? Whole thing for 50. Fine. My name is Boris. Thanks, boys. You OK? Yeah. Ready for more? Yeah, sure. Hey, how'd it go, man. Fine. Hey, you know what I'm talking about. Is there a bathroom around anywhere? Yeah, man, uh, right in the penthouse upstairs. Go in the alley around the corner. Hey, go back to the bed. I'll just take the couch again. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. Good night. Hey. Hey, Dodge, you got a cigarette? - No, fuck off, man. Get your own. - Please. Hey, look, I think you can handle this one on your own? - Think so? - Yeah, yeah. Trust me, man. He's cool. I know him. Go for it. Hey, I think I'm gonna go with you after all. Really? Hey, if the Senator wants the blond, I'm gonna have to supervise. Nothing intrusive. - Is that really necessary? - Yes, it is really necessary. - What are you, new? - Yes. You're not gonna actually go into the room with him, are you? I'm gonna wait outside. Hey, wait up. Hey! I thought you were waiting outside. Yes, outside the door of the room. That outside. - Really? - Yes. Hey, that's the fucking deal, OK? Yes, man, that's the fucking deal-- outside the door of the room. Jesus. Would you, uh, would you like a cigarette? No, thanks. I don't smoke. Good for you. Neither do I. You know, I, uh, I don't want to have sex with you. I'm sorry. No, no. Don't apologize. I just, uh, I just like to talk. OK. So, uh, how old are you? 18. Hm. You look younger. Yeah, I'm 17. Well, why don't you, uh, take off your shirt. What's your name? Oliver. That was my father's name. Really? My mom told me I was named after my grandfather. What's that? It was my mother's. Can I see it? And what about your father? - What about your father. - I don't know. You don't know? What do you mean you don't know? I mean, I don't know him. I don't know. Oh, well, what did she tell you about him? She told me when she was about 10 years old, she used to put the TV up on the sink when she would take a bath. And it would be perched right on the edge. And she would get a champagne glass and then steal one of her dad's cigarettes and then get into the bath with him. And she said she always pretended to be Doris Day when she took a bath. But it was like her secret Doris Day. Nobody ever knew she did that. And then when she was, like, 14 years old, she realized she could have been electrocuted if the TV had fallen into the water. And her parents never knew for all those years. That's, uh, that's all she ever told you about that? Pretty much. Do you always ask about people's families? I hope I didn't, um, I hope I didn't scare you before. That's OK. Yeah. I think you'd better go now. Bye. Wait. Hey. How'd it go in there? Huh? Something happen? He never fucks anybody. What? Did anything happen? - No. - No. Listen, I want you to go hail a cab for us. - Just me? - Yes. - Why? - Just as a favor to me. Please. Dodge. Come on. - Hey. - Fuck off! Oh my brother, my brother where have you gone? Left your poor mother sitting by the fire alone. Well, there's gold in the dirt, if you can find it by dawn. But your poor mother's dying by the fire alone. Come dance with me. Oh, no, I don't dance. Ah, you're gonna say no to a beautiful woman? Come one, dance. - Come on. - Come on. Oh my sister, my sister-- Why don't you guys go clean up this place? do you cry? There's a moon in the belly and a heart in the sky. Go sweep out the kitchen and pour out the rye. There's a moon in-- hi, guys. How was your night? OK, I guess. Senator picked him up. - Did you go with him? - Yes. Watch your tone of voice. Oh, Dodge, I have take-out. [INAUDIBLE] Please don't do this here. I can't watch this. Go into the office. So how was it with the Senator? That's a light sort of evening. Yeah. It was all right. Did he pay you? Yeah. Well, tell us It was fine, you know, just talking. He was asking me a lot of questions and stuff. Like what? He was asking a lot about my mother. That's weird. Yeah, all he ever asked me about was my cock and balls. Please, Noah. I think it was-- I think it was because of my locket. It freaked him out. Let's see it. You want my bed, blondie? I thought you could sleep in the bed tonight. You don't mind sleeping on the couch? No, I thought we could both sleep in the bed. Nah. It's big enough. Oliver, no. I just don't want to sleep by myself tonight. It's not going to happen. It's a bad idea, trust me. Go get in bed. Go to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. I'm glad you were with me tonight. Thanks. OK. You're welcome. Oh. - Hey. - Good morning. What'd you do, wet the bed? Hey, you look fabulous. Thank you very much, dear. Here you go. Were you waiting outside the hotel last night? No, the room. I was-- I was waiting outside the room. Oh. He's-- he's still a little nervous, you know. Right. You going out with him again tonight? Yeah. I figure I should. I mean, last night didn't really count, because it was the Senator. So I figure, like, one or two more nights. Maybe one. Bill wants to see you back at work. Did he say that? Uh-hm. Come on. Let's go for a walk. Watch it. There's cops. Paranoid. You smoke too much. What? You think that's funny. Why is that funny? No, it's just very-- I don't know. I want to talk to you about something. Yeah, what? Well, Nancy told me about that car from Quebec. Well, don't get bad at her. Ah, Jesus. She told me because she cares about you. What, you don't think that's true? Well, if you don't know that-- OK, OK. And Oliver tells me you're screaming at a car last night. What the fuck is this, kindergarten? People are telling on me. Just listen to me. If you don't want to tell me what's going on, I think it will help you if you do. Because if it's one of those things where you're just, like, making it up? Or is it just-- is it really happening? Whatever. Hey, it's bad for the boys to see you upset. You know, they look up to you, Dodge. Now, if you want me to make the car go away, you know, I'll have it stopped. - OK? - Yeah. If you want, all right? OK, yeah. Thanks. Don't thank me. That's what I do. All right? Did you have some breakfast? Come have some breakfast. - Stop it. - Would you just relax? Don't let me interrupt your flirting there, Don Juan. - I wasn't flirting. - Yes, you were. Now Betsy, you have to be careful. He has a girlfriend. Oh, right. I heard all about her. You guys think this is so funny, don't you? - Yeah. - No, honey. Well, would you think it's funny if I told you she was cheating on me? Oh no, honey, that's sad. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it sucks. Hey, Nancy, can you teach me how to dance? Oh, you're so weird, Charlie. Oh, come on, why? Teach me. - Which one? - Like you were doing last night. The waltz. Look at my feet and count the beats. All right. Left. One, two, three. One, two-- Count with me. One, two, three. One, two, three. Who's that? You do know him? Yeah, you really freaked him out. Yeah, well, um, he-- he has something of mine that, uh-- listen, would you, uh, give that to him for me? - Sure. - Thanks. No problem. OK, good to see ya. OK. - That was the Senator. - Oh. Everything all right? Well, we think Adam's run off again. Haven't seen him around for a couple of days. Now I got to tell Bill. I've always got to tell Bill, even when I don't want to. Right? That's the deal. Sometimes I wish I didn't know things. I just wish. Want to hear something weird, honey? Guess who came to the diner yesterday. The Senator. Yeah, I-- I can't believe he came, you know? It was kind of nice, though. Not nice, but interesting, you know-- I mean, to finally see him after hearing so much about him from all the boys and all. He, uh, he wanted to talk to Oliver, the new boy. I told you about him, right? This, uh, this beautiful little blond thing that Dodge brought in. Yeah, he wanted to see him. Charlie gave him his card. And so he wanted Oliver to call him. I mean, he must be crazy, right, honey? Isn't that a weird thing to do. - Hey. - Hey. Have you seen Dodge? Man, you just missed Bill. Dodge? It work so you can do this? I do this so I can work. Did Bill do that to Charlie? What the fuck do you care, Senator boy? I'm not going to call him. Fagin said he's probably crazy. So I'm not going to call him. Ah, what the fuck did I tell you about this? No. Why not? Because I don't fucking want to, OK? Is that a good enough reason for you? I don't fucking want to. I just fucking don't. Don't touch me. Now you have a good evening, my little friends. Oliver, can I talk to you for a moment? You do well out there. But if you even see that evil man, you come right back here. That goes for everyone. No one goes anywhere with or even talks to the Senator. Hear me? He's crazy. Oliver. I have to talk to you. Charlie gave you the card, right? - Are you OK? - I'm fine. Listen to me. You can't tell anyone I spoke to you, OK? This is really, really important. You can't tell anybody, OK? - OK. - OK. Now you're gonna call him, right? I don't know. Probably. Why only probably? I don't know. I don't know. Look, maybe he-- maybe he-- What? I don't know. Maybe he wants to take care of you. Did he say that? No. No he-- not exactly. What if he's crazy, or he wants to kill me or something? I can't just call somebody. You know, Fagin's right. And also, I don't-- I don't know if I want to let him take care of me. You know, Dodge has been so good to me. He took me in and he found me work and he introduced me to you and Charlie. You know, I just feel like I owe him something for that. I've got to tell you something Dodge has been really good to you, you're right. But believe you me, if he knew a way out of this place, he would leave. You don't owe anybody here anything. They didn't do you any favors. Oliver, this is not a good life. If someone gives you the opportunity to do something else, have the opportunities, for god's sakes, you'd be so stupid not to take it. Just promise me you'll keep the card. Yeah. - Promise. - I promise. OK. I'll see you later. You run along. Catch up with your friends. No. No, I don't think that's what she meant. OK, then. Well-- yeah, that's what I heard, but-- hello? Bill? - He wants Oliver. - Yeah, let's go. I think I'll go by myself. Really? Yeah, I have to start sometime. Might as well start now. - What was that about? - I don't know. Oh, God. Hey, where are you going? Jimmy! Jimmy! Wait. Hey, hold a sec, Jimmy. Don't fucking touch me, asshole. I don't want to make a scene. I just want to talk. You don't want to make a scene. Fuck you. I don't want to talk to you. - Come on. It's OK. - Jesus Christ, man. - I'm-- - Listen to me. I'm supposed to be working, you know. I got to get back there. To whore? That's what you do, isn't it? Huh? Hey, let's have a cup of coffee. All right? No. Jimmy, listen, I need to talk to you. Then why didn't you come here before? Huh? Fuck, you know what? I don't even care. Get the fuck away from me. Get the fuck out of my life. I-- I have to earn a living. I drove down here from Montreal. I'm sleeping in my car. All right? You're fucking insane. I'll pay you for the night. How much do you want for the night? I'll pay you whatever you want. Just tell me. 300. Pesos? Are you shitting me? Yeah, fuck off then. All right. No, no, I'll pay you. 300. So, um, what kind of stuff do you do? I don't know. Uh, you don't know? Whatever you want to do. You're beautiful. So how is it? How do you think it is? So are you like a-- a junkie? Yep, I am. Tell the folks. Oh, you know, man. I wanted to talk to you for so long. They why didn't you get out of your fucking car and come and talk to me, then? It's been three weeks of this shit. Look, I just needed-- to know if you were OK, you know. You need anything? You need some money? No. Where are you living? I'm not telling you. Hm. Look, I know you-- I know you think that, uh, that I just-- You know what I think? You-- you fucking insane? Fuck, you know. I don't even care anyone. I had no idea he was doing that shit to you. Yeah, bullshit. That is bullshit. I didn't. I'm so sorry. You were-- you were supposed to be my older brother, you know? You're the guy who's supposed to protect me from that shit. Yeah. Yeah, I know you think I'm a coward, or a liar. But I-- I had to make a choice, Jimmy. Hm? I had to choose to have a life, to have a future. I had to just say, fuck him. You know? He fucked me up, but fuck him. And all I can do is succeed in spite of it. I had to make that choice, you know? Yeah. I-- I cannot believe we're even having this conversation. No, I had to make that choice. And you chose this. You chose to let yourself, uh, sink into a life of shit. I mean, you don't understand me. Well, that's fine, because I fucking don't understand you. How can you-- how can you life like this, man? It's like getting-- it's like getting raped for a living. At least it's not a hobby anymore. Now give me the money. I've got to go. That's funny. Come on. It's not even 2:00 yet. Can we just talk? I really-- I don't want to talk. Give me the money. I'm leaving now. Give it to me. Here's $400, man. Jimmy. So I guess there isn't any chance of you coming home with me, huh? You still live with them? Yeah. Bye, David. Have a nice life. I just went out to get some air. Hey. You look like you could use a cigarette. Thanks, man. - You waiting on someone? - No one in particular. You got a place to crash tonight? I guess that was all kind of depending on who I met. I got a place, if you're interested. Really? - You interested? - Yeah. OK, just follow me. Faggot. You think I was going to fuck you up the ass? Look at this. Whose dick did you have to suck for this, you fucking pervert? Yes, I understand, Bill. Of course. No, well, you think I don't want the same thing too? All right. I'll-- well, I'll get him to you. I'll make that clear. Yes. Yes. Well, I'm sorry. Uh-- sorry to trouble you. OK. Bye then. Oh, is Nancy-- - Dodge? Is that you? - Yeah. So you let the kid go out by himself? Yeah. So I assume you were working. Right? Yeah. So come give me the money. I don't have it. - What are you talking about? - I was robbed. Don't feed me bullshit. Dodge? Did you just do this? Of course not. He told me he got robbed. Jesus Christ. Fuck off. You're the last one. I'm sorry, buddy. I shouldn't have hit you. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Could I get a cup of coffee, please? Can you just give me a sec? Hey, Betsy, do you know when Nancy's working today? She's not. Well, do you know when she's working tomorrow? Oliver, could you do me a really big favor? Would you tell Charlie that I need to speak to him as soon as possible? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. - How are you feeling? - Fine. What happened to you last night? I got mugged. Hey, Charlie, Betsy says to call her. OK. Well? She's dead. Who's dead? What are you talking about? Nancy. I'm going for a walk. What happened? I'm sorry. - Yeah? - Um, is Benjamin home? Yeah. Grandpa. Yeah. Hi. What are you doing here? Uh, your secretary gave me your address. - Did she? - Yeah. She won't be my secretary much longer. Oh no. No, don't get mad at her. She thought I was your grandson. Look, you should have called first. This is a terrible time. I know. Uh, happy birthday. I-- I've just been thinking a lot. And I shouldn't-- I shouldn't have ever started doing that. I was-- I was stupid. And I don't want to be there anymore. I don't. And I hope you know what I'm trying to say, because I'm having sort of a hard time. I can't talk right now, OK? You're gonna have to leave. You, uh, you can't come back here either. OK? You get it? You can't come to this house. I don't know what your friend told you, but I never intended to, uh, invite you to dinner. Are you-- are you saying that you don't-- No, what I'm saying is that I know where to find you, OK? - I know. I'll find you. - I'm sorry. Yeah, OK. Well, thanks for coming over. And, um, we'll figure this out later. Yeah, why are you here? I need to-- I need to talk to you. Yeah, I really don't want to. Well, I-- I really need to, Jimmy, because there's some stuff-- This is like the worst possible timing you could have chosen right now. All right, I'll pay $400. - I need for you-- - What? Why-- why do you-- why are you talking so fucking strangely? What? I need for you to understand me. I do understand you. I get it. You made a-- I got it last night. You made a choice, right? I get it. No. I need for you to acknowledge-- You keep saying that. What is it? Why do you need for me to do anything? You know, why do you care what I think of you, David? You know-- I-- you made a decision. You live with that. I made the right decision. OK. Is that what you want me to say, that you're right and I'm wrong? Is that it? That's not what I want. Yeah, good, because I'm not going to fucking say that. But it's true. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to get my master's degree. I'm gonna have a wife and kids. I'm gonna be happy. You know what you're going to be doing? You're gonna be face down on a sidewalk somewhere, ODed on heroine. You make, uh-- What? You make such a big deal out of everything. What a waste. I can't believe I agreed to talk to you at all. It's the same fucking thing as always-- you pretending like everything is fine. Um, I'm just fucking-- I'm fucking sorry I have a family at all. This coffee date is over now. Hey, give me the money. What if I say no? Then I'll probably get beaten to death. Give it to me. I made the right choice, Jimmy. Fuck, man. I don't fucking care, all right? Jesus Christ, yes. You make the right choice. Congratulations. I don't want to hear about it anymore. Give it to me. Give me the fucking money. I'll, uh, I'll give it to you down there. Why? Fuck, I don't even care. What? Why are we back here, man? Show me what you do. What? What are you talking about? You're a whore. And I'm paying. So show me what you do to deserve, uh, all this money. Fuck off, man. Fuck off. Give it to me. Show me what you do. I don't know. What-- I don't know if you're trying to be funny or what, man. You're-- don't be a fucking asshole. Give me-- give me the money, man. Davy. Davy, that-- that money that you gave me last night, that was fucking stolen, man. I was mugged. Look-- look at my face. Look at my face, man. OK, if I don't take back money tonight, man-- - It's all right. - Please. Then come on. Come on. Oh, god. Don't-- don't do this. I don't do this. I don't do this, all right? You do this. Why are you doing this to me? - Come on. - Why? Why are you doing this to me, man? You can't just leave. Hi. Go look in the office. I'm so glad to see you. I went to see the Senator. I'm so stupid. Shh. Fagin was right Shh. Shh. [INAUDIBLE], you fucker. You want to die? You fuck! You fucking-- you fucking whore. You're a fucking whore. Is-- is this what you wanted? Huh? Come here. Come here, this is what you want. Huh? You fucking whore! You fu-- you-- fuck! Fuck! Dodge, where you been? Have you seen Betsy? What the fuck happened here? What did you do, man? What are you doing? Oh god. Dodge, have you seen Ch-- Charlie. What time is it? - I think it's 5:30. - Why? I gotta go. Can I have a kiss goodbye?
