When the Rain Falls When the rain falls. It makes me want to cut my nails. She appeared in my dream again, but it didn't last long. It is wrong. Wake up sleepyhead. Hazuki, Oi! Your breakfast is here. Here are your riceballs. Thanks. I'll take it in a bit. What else did you bring? Tea? No i brought coffee. I'm so tired right now. Tired? I had a long meeting with the board of directors. It was boring. They kept arguing but never came to a conclusion. How absurd is that? What's so unusual about that? I guess nothing. Maybe I'm just bored of my life. I keep counting every hour until i can go home. Maybe i should find a new job. I think you just need to get laid. All office jobs are like this. Maybe i should just start my own business. Are you serious? Serious? Maybe yes, maybe not. Maybe i just need a vacation. Alright then. See you later. You finished this earliar than expected. If you keep this up, you'll get a promotion for sure. Thanks. Uh... I love working with you ma'am. You're lovely to work with. That's sweet of you to say it. It's the truth. I see you still have a lot of work left to do. You should only do the tasks you're given. Don't overwork yourself. Or you'll get tired. Understood. Ah, here you are Hanaka. You keep forgetting your real duties. I didn't hire you for typing some words, did i? You didn't? You think that's funny? No sir, i was just trying to lighten the mood. Oh, is that right? I wouldn't dear offend you sir. I'm just very stupid, as you know... We're doing that again? You should stick to what you're good at. Is that right? You should at least buy me dinner after this. Turn around bitch. I'll give you something better than dinner. You'll enjoy it, i assure you. You'll be in paradise. Hanaka, are you in there? That bastard... is at it again. Find me a tissue. You can find it yourself. Let's see here. Young men. Young women. Old men. Our clients cover a wide range of people of all genders & ages. But our advertisement is mostly catered to young men. Infact 70% of our advertising budget is spent on that group. Does it make sense to you? We need to fix it. To attract a wider audience. And improve our sales. It makes sense to me. Good. We need to improve our sales & also make our clients seem more welcomed. Understood? Understood ma'am. You may leave now. You have a meeting with him later, don't you? Try to negotiate for the photoshoot. We need to cut down on expenditures. Ofcourse. I will bring it down as much as i can. I know i can trust you. You're the most dedicated employee around here. Keep up the good work! Yes ma'am! Why does she keep targetting me? It's like she hates me of something. I think she hates us all equally. She needs to work on her attitude. She's too cranky. Just ignore her. She talks to us like she's the CEO of the company. I should be in her place. That means I'll always keep working under a woman. What's wrong with that? It's in your destiny. You're meant to serve under women. I must've been a sinner in my past life to deserve this fate. What's wrong with you finger? Huh? Your thumb nail is bloody. You shouldn't let it soak like that. You should get it treated before it gets infected. No, it's nothing serious. It's just a scrape. You should still get it treated. I'll see a clinic after I'm done here. Good. And don't worry about the photoshoot. I'll negotiate. Thanks. Not many models would negotiate so easily. I'm not really a model. It's my first time doing it. Really? Really. You seemed... professional. The water was cold. When will i get my promotion. You keep postponing it. I can't just give it out of the blue. You'll have to wait for an opportunity. Then you need to stop calling me here. Find some other girl to warm your bed. You act like you don't enjoy it too. We both have a fun time, no? I don't do this for fun. I only do it for the promotion you promised me. I'll get you your promotion soon. I promise. So can we have some fun now? You need to give me a date. Don't ruin the mood. I'm very horny right now. First give me a date for the promotion. Do it by the end of this month. Ok I'll think about it. Now do some work. What? You want that promotion right? Then you'll do "overtime" till the end of the month. C'mon get to it. I'm getting sleepy now. Have you checked all the documents? They seem fine to me. Oh, and did you meet that model guy? Did he agree to negotiate? Yeah he was very kind. He agreed without hesitating. Good. It's hard to find good people these days. You should get along with him. Be friendly when you meet him. Ms. Shiori, what are you still doing here? You should go home now. Yeah, I'm about to leave. You're the backbone of this company. Don't stress yourself & just keep finding ways to improve our sales. It's time to leave. I'll be off now. Yes ma'am. The model guy says he will visit tomorrow. Your... umbrella. Thank you. I've become to forgetful. It's probably due to stress. You'll catch a cold. Come with me to my place. I'm taking a shower at her place. Could this be the start of something more? Were you about to kiss me? When i was in highschool, i used to dream about kissing girls. I knew i was different. I was attracted to girls instead of boys. And it was a problem because i had to hide this fact from everyone. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. It's ok to tell me. I'm attracted to girls too. I know. I've noticed the way you look at me. Then do you also know i like you. I wasn't sure, but yes i could feel your emotions. People like us can't be open about our feelings. Any wrong assumption can lead to embarassment. But I'm happy to know i was right about this. It's good to know that someone likes you in that way. Even if you can never be with them. It's a pity because we look good together. Sorry, I'm just speaking my mind. Maybe if i was younger... And maybe if you weren't my assistant. We could've been more than just colleagues. These things don't matter. This can't happen. I've liked you for a long time. I'm not going to give up on you now. So don't push me away. I used to... dream about things like this too. Back in highschool & since ever after. This... feels like a dream too. A beautiful dream. The best dream ever. How did it feel? It felt unreal. Like the most intense happiness. My wish finally came true... But will it last? Good morning ma'am. Morning. Am i supposed to pretend nothing happened last night? Was that just a fling? Do you prefer tea or coffee? I prefer tea myself. Hey Hazuki. There you are. Come sit here. She spends half her time daydreaming. I disagree. She's very dedicated to her duties. Is she right? Are you that hardworking? I try to my best to work hard. Trying isn't enough. You should already be working at your best. I'll try my best to improve sir. Good. Come by my house later. We'll chat. Are you happy at office? Huh? Are things good at office for you? Ofcourse everything is fine. The pay is good. The work is simple enough. It seems I'm the only one who doesn't like it there. Maybe I'm just in the wrong profession. I just don't have the patience that you girls have. I know what you mean. When i first started working there. I felt the same way as you. Then after a while i got used to it. Now i just focus on the money & try to have a good time outside the office life. That makes life much simpler for me. But i do wonder if i could've done things differently. I can relate with you about that last sentence. Ofcourse. You're younger & junior to me. You can still change your life if you want. You'll have an easiar time adapting to a different profession. Very encouraging. But i know you're gonna keep working here. Nowhere else would you find colleagues like me. Nowhere. Let's talk about something else. How do you convince someone to date you? What do you mean? I slept with someone last night. Now it's awkward between us. Weren't you single? Did you meet someone? It's someone at the office. That's why it's even more awkward. You slept with someone at the office? Who is it ? You must tell me. You must tell me. That's private. Are you really gonna hide it from me? From me? Is it the new model guy we hired? Really? I'll tell you who it is if we actually start dating. Tell me what? I've already figured it out. So how have you been? I've been well. I must thank you for what you did last time. I already told you it's no big deal. I was happy to help you out. I'm grateful. Actually i wanted to ask you out. I find you very attractive. Well done on this report. There were no mistakes this time either. I don't do mistakes. I do everything with commitment. Mistakes are never done on purpose. But some mistakes are worth doing. Ofcourse. This mistake is worth repeating. This isn't a mistake. It's a gift. Wait a minute. Let me cut my nails. Are you crying? They're coming out on their own. Your tears are precious. Don't waste them like that. Just don't. Give me a lovebite. It's late. I have to go somewhere. So early in the morning? It's important. I'll see you later. You can sleep here for as long as you want. Stop fooling around. You gave me a lovebite. Why are you so late? You were supposed to come early. Sorry. I overslept. And here i couldn't sleep without your help. Time for us to have some fun. Come over here. Calm down. What is that? Is that what i think it is? It's just a bug bite. It doesn't matter. It's time for me to bite you. I can't get enough of your delicious body. You smell different. But I'm sure you taste the same. You're so tight. So wet. I love the way it feels. You're my favorite fuck. That's for sure. You can wash up & leave. I'm off. As you all know we have hired some new models. One of them is Mr.Mikoto. You've all met him. Hazuki, Hanaka said you need to see him today. Sure. I can't find his address. Where is he? Hanaka tried to contact his social media, but he didn't respond. Why would he disappear like this? He has switched off his phone too. I hope he is alright. He seems like a good guy. Maybe he'll come back later. I can kind of relate with him. How? Sometimes i also want to abandom everything & leave. Times when i regret my life choices. When i wonder if things could be different. Useless thoughts. They're not that useless... That's our heart speaking to us. I wonder if such thoughts bothered him. Mr.Mikoto seemed sensitive like that to me. Let me know if you hear from him. My head... I'm having a headache. Are you ok? I'll be fine. Make sure you don't give me any lovebites. They're hard to hide & it gives me trouble. What's wrong? What is our... relationship exactly? We take care of each other. We're special friends. We're caretakers of each other. I thought we were closer than that. What do you mean? I hope you don't have any unrealistic expectations. I do. I do have. Please stop. You'll end up hurting yourself. We can't be a couple... In this lifetime. Is there someone else in your life? Yes there is. That's why you shouldn't get too attached to me. Then you should go to them. Are you here to see me? I came to discuss something. Huh? You have to let go of Shiori. You can have Hanaka. Get in. What's all this drama about? I want you to stop seeing her. I can see whoever i want to see. What's it to you? If you don't stop, I'll expose it to the company. Hanaka can take Shiori's place if you want. Why are you butting in my personal matters? Huh? What's your relationship with Shiori? Is there something going on between you? Are you secretly dating each other? I'm just joking. Joking. It's just a joke. Joke? Well, you need to offer something more than just threats. Have sex with me one time, and i will leave her alone. You're a pig to the end. Fine let's do it. Now that's what i like to hear. Where are we doing this? I'm confused. Why are you doing this for her? I'm confused. Why are you doing this for her? Someone like you wouldn't be able to understand. Could it be what i said as a joke. Is that it? So what if it is? So that means she has been decieving me. You and Shiori have been sleeping together. Well now you'll sleep with me. Thanks for that. What? Kissing is off the limits? And what about her? What do you do with her? You'll never understand. It's funnier knowing that I'm having sex with a lesbian. It feels like I'm doing something special. Surely... this has to be better than what you do with Shiori. What's sex without good old penetration. You may leave. You must keep your promise. What promise? You will stop seeing her. Yeah sure. What happened? I met the old bastard today. But why? I told him to leave you alone. Why did you? You don't know anything about my situation. I'm serious about you. Why do you keep distancing from me? I am serious about you too. But i have my reasons for doing what i do. You have to choose between him & me. That's it. Why are you making this so hard for me. We are together, is that not enough for you? I want you all to myself. I'm not willing to share you with anyone. I want to be able to tell everyone that you're my girlfriend. Am i asking for too much? I want to cut my nails. Let's take a shower together. Feels so good. Is this my new beginning With My Shiori. This is just like my dream. But it's real. It's happening. My dream has come true. Shiori is mine now. All mine. I hope this day never ends. Never. Never. I'm gonna folow my heart now. Amazing. What do you want? I told you not to disturb me without reason. What's going on between them? Who are you referring to? You know exactly what I'm talking about. And i know you know about it. It's my private matter. What does it have to do with you? Are you also involved with it? I'm not. But i want to get involved with her. Then you're talking to the wrong person. If you're interested in either one of them. You should talk to them. They seem serious about each other. So you're probably out of luck. I have a favor to ask you. Please keep all this a secret. We don't want gossip in the company. This isn't fair. You all had your way. Why must i settle? Are my feelings not worth anything? I can't believe I'm starting over again. Why? I thought I'd be stuck in that soulless life forever. Until you came. Then are we really a couple now? Can we tell others about our relationship? Screw Hanaka. We support you girls. We are behind you. Yep. You don't have to worry about it. Huh? Come here and see this. It's important. [The Planning Office Manager, Shiori Sawada and her subordinate, Hazuki Kimihara, are having an affair with each other.] [I would like to share the above information. Thank you very much.] [Hanaka Mizushima, Publishing Editorial Department] Hanaka did this? Yes, we think she was jealous of you two. Jealous of us? See this. Her social media is filled with jealousy & heartbreak quotes. Did you know about this? Some people can be so shameless & miserble. It takes one action to lose all your respect. Jealousy can turn you into a wretch. What did she achieve by doing this? This won't get her anything. Is it a dream? No it's reality. You forgot about her. Hanaka! It's over. She'll remain single forever. Nobody wants to date reckless fools. The obsessive ones are worse. Aggressive ones are worse. The ones who can't seperate personal & profesional lifes are the worst. Nothing can be worse than our boss though. You're right about that. Enough of this crap. Do you think badmouthing her will comfort me? Or make her regret doing it? I think... we should... stop seeing... each other. I absolutely forgot about her. I used to date her in highschool. It's all in the past. Thank you for meeting me after all this time. I decided to say farewell before i go on a overseas trip. So you'll be modeling in a foreign country. Good for you. I hope I'll have better luck there. Ofcourse you will. You're talented & kind. I also wanted to apologize for abandoning your project back then. You should apologize to Ms.Shiori. I already apologized to her on a call. She forgave me. All is well then. And i hope you and Ms.Shiori can live happily together. And i hope you and Ms.Shiori can live happily together. I have truly moved on from you. Maybe I'll find a foreign girl for myself. Let's cheer for success. My life is more complicated than that. But i hope you're right. I hope life can finally calm down for me. As long as you stay beside Ms.Shiori, you'll be fine. Really? You also think she & i are meant for each other. I don't know about your personal lifes. But you look good together. When you love someone. You can't give up on them over petty reasons. The only reason i gave up on you is because it was one-sided. But it's different for you two. So stay by her side. If you give up on her. She'll break down. When you break a person's heart. You break their identity. There's no worse feeling than a heartbreak. You're a very emotional man. That's very admirable. Never change. As for me. I'll listen to what my heart tells me. The heart. The heart knows the right path for you. Even if i make the wrong decision. I'll be content with it. When i come back from overseas. I hope I'll find you in a happy state. You'll stay friends with me? I'll stay a friend to both you & Ms.Shiori. I mean it sincerely. Life is too short to hold grudges or regrets. It's best to correct your mistakes & move on. He's absolutely right. You only live once. Feelings. Love. Sex. Passion. Devotion. You're my happiness. Happiness. You are. Come back to me. She later told me her secret. She had a son she had to take care off. That is why she was seeing the boss back then. Amme. You're late kid. Mama. You've adapted my appearence Shiori. You've had a huge influence on my life dear. You turned my life around completely. And how are you kid? I'm not a kid. Not a kid? He doesn't like being called a kid. He wants to grow up & protect his mother. But his mother already has a protector & savior.
