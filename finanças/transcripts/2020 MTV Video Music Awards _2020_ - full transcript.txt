- Before we get into the music tonight, we need to take the time to talk about the devastating loss of Chadwick Boseman, an actor whose talent and passion is a true inspiration to all the fans he touched and everyone he encountered. We dedicate tonight's show to a man whose spirit touched so many. He is a true hero, not just onscreen, but in everything he did. His impact lives forever.

Let's give it up for The Weeknd, you guys, performing over a thousand feet above Manhattan from EDGE at Hudson Yards. Tonight, we are taking over the best city in the world. Are you ready? It's the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards! - It's the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, with performances by... With appearances by... And the first ever MTV Tricon Award honoring Lady Gaga. [cheers and applause] Please welcome your host, Keke Palmer. [Keke Palmer, "Sticky"] ♪ ♪ - Welcome to the 2020 MTV VMAs! We are all over New York City tonight, from Brooklyn and the Bronx to the center of it all, the world-famous Empire State Building, right here in the heart of Manhattan. This is incredible. I can't believe MTV asked me to host. I don't if I was their first choice, or the only one brave enough to do it during COVID. Either way, I got the job, loves! But it's not all different this year. One of the coolest part of the VMAs is that we have the best fans in the world. And guess what. They're here tonight. Let me hear you make some noise! [cheers and applause] I gotta say it. 2020 has undoubtedly been a rough year for everybody, and I'm not just talking about my edges. In fact, when something goes wrong, I just say, "2020!" But as rough as it's been, there have been incredible moments of inspiration that have given my generation hope. I mean, we've seen heroes go above and beyond, whether they drive a delivery truck, work at a grocery store, or serve on the frontlines in a hospital. And with the Black Lives Matter movement, we've seen our generation step up, take to the streets, and make sure our voices will be heard. Enough is enough. What we just witnessed in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is yet another devastating reminder that we can't stop, that we can never tolerate police brutality or any injustice. We must continue the fight to end systemic racism. The leaders of that movement are you. Us, the people watching tonight. It's our time to be the change we wanna see. We need to come together, and music, music has that power. Music can help us heal. It's all love, and that's what tonight is about. We are making the impossible possible, pushing the boundaries of music performances because that's what we do on the VMAs. We've got the biggest stars in music. Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. Doja Cat. Black Eyed Peas. Miley Cyrus. Maluma. CNCO. And for the first time ever, BTS at the VMAs. The next performer is speaking directly to the times we're living in, so whenever you make mention of him, make sure you put some respect on his name. Give it up for DaBaby!

Um, I also want to thank Grant Miller at Ingenuity, who did all of the visual effects, and my--there were two women who I've worked with in the past on music videos who were the ones who this time around convinced me that I really was up to the challenge of directing on my own, and those women were my producers on this video, Rebecca Skinner and Jill Harden, so thank you for that. I was told that this was an industry-voted award, so I wanna say thank you to everyone in the industry who voted for this video, but I also really wanna thank the fans because you are the only reason why the industry cares about anything that I do, and everything that you guys have done with "Folklore" this summer, I am just so blown away and taken aback by your generosity to me.

I remember thinking I had cried so many tears that it felt like unfathomable downpour from my eyes, but even with that much rain, you don't have to drown even though it feels like you are. You can still swim, and if there's a strong current with a bunch of waves, and they keep crashing over you, if you keep swimming, you'll reach the center of the ocean where it's calm, still, and peaceful. May God bless you.

I never wanted to be anything else. I remember when I first came to California after I built this small following for myself in New York, I would be taken out to these fancy dinners with executives who wanted to sign me, and I remember I never ever ordered anything more than a whiskey neat or a large sake if we were at a Japanese spot. And I remember that they used to ask me, "Hey, LG, why aren't you eating?" And I said, "Because... I didn't come for the California roll." Everyone always knew, if they were hanging out with me, that I was on a mission to spread joy through culture, through dance, through music. I've written music my whole life, and I feel so honored, that I get to do this every day, and thank you so much for this award during a year that I'm promoting "Chromatica," my record, an album that's a diary of a very dark time in my head, and it's brought me so much joy to see that you can spin your struggles into gold and you just gotta believe in yourself and you gotta surround yourself with good people. I surround myself with my family. They're here. My family. I love you! If you wanna win an award like this, don't eat the California roll so they know you mean business. I love you. [kisses] Thank you, MTV! Thank you, fans! I love you. You're the best.

You can't just call her a triple threat because her talent and influence seems endless. She turns pop music into high art. She redefines fashion. She's not only an incredible musician and composer, but a powerhouse actor. And she's a bold champion for equality, human rights, and mental health. She is someone who inspires and empowers all of us. Lady Gaga is in a class of her own, and tonight, we celebrate her many gifts with the MTV Tricon Award. - Global music superstar, award-winning actor, fashion trailblazer, devoted activist. Lady Gaga is a singular force, a multidimensional artist like no other. - ♪ My biggest enemy is me ♪ - One of the bestselling singer-songwriters of all time. - My first Moon Man. - 13 VMAs, 11 Grammys, six number one albums, and an Oscar for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe for her first TV acting role, an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in her film debut. - If you have a dream, fight for it. ♪ I want your loving ♪ - Her music videos, live performances, and red carpet fashions gave us some of the most iconic pop culture moments of the last decade. - ♪ Caught in a bad romance ♪ And sometimes, life gives us a million reasons to wanna give up, but we stick around. - An activist who fights for equality, a philanthropist supporting the mental and emotional wellness of young people, and from the moment she smashed onto the music scene, a true LGBTQ hero. - Bless God and bless the gays. - Unexpected, unforgettable, unstoppable, the first ever MTV Tricon, Lady Gaga. - Please welcome the first ever MTV Tricon Award recipient, Lady Gaga. - ♪ I'm a free woman ♪ ♪ I'm a free woman ♪ Oh, my gosh. Guys, this is so cool. This means a lot to me. It means more to me than you probably even realize. I've been making music since I was a little girl, and even though I had really, really big dreams, I truly never could've imagined that someday, I would be given an award like this that honored me for so many of my passions. I want you to know, I failed over and over again as an actress and as a musician when I was young, and though I gave back to the local community through service as a young woman in New York, philanthropy became a much bigger part of my life as a star, and I started the Born This Way Foundation with my mother Cynthia once my record broke. I wanna share this award with everybody at home tonight. Everybody at home that is their own form of a Tricon. I wish for you to think right now of three things that define who you are and take a moment to reward yourself for your bravery. This has not been an easy year for a lot of people, but what I see in the world is a massive triumph of courage. I also hope that people at home that have big dreams, I hope they see me here today and accepting this award and know how grateful I am, and I want you to know that you can do this too. Just because we're separated right now and culture may feel less alive in some ways, I know a renaissance is coming and the wrath of pop culture will inspire you and the rage of art will empower you as it responds to hardship with its generosity and love. This is what I believe. I want nothing more than to be your artist in 2020. It's a total privilege. I love you. Stay safe, speak your mind, and I might sound like a broken record, but wear a mask. It's a sign of respect. Thank you. - Give it up for Travis Barker. - Hip-hop has always been a huge part of my life. It's been one of the biggest blessings to collaborate with some of today's most important hip-hop artists. The nominees in this category inspire me to make music, to evolve, and to always push the boundaries of creativity. Here are the nominees for Best Hip-Hop. - And the VMA goes to... Megan Thee Stallion. - Thank you, hotties. Thank you, MTV. Oh, my gosh, I cannot believe I'm Best Hip-Hop. [laughs] But thank y'all for real. Thank y'all so much. This is my second Moon Man. Definitely not my last. I just wanna say thank y'all so very much and we gon' keep turning up. [laughs] - Congrats, Megan Thee Stallion. We can't celebrate hip-hop without paying tribute to the voices we lost this year. Juice Wrld and Pop Smoke were trailblazing artists, loved by the community and millions of fans across the globe. Their music and influence live on, and so will the legacy of the other brilliant artists we lost.
