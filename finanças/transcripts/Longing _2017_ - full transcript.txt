Hi, Ariel. Hi, Ronit. - Hi. You look great. - Thanks. It's been so long. - Yes. 20 years? Exactly 20. Kind of exciting, isn't it? - Yes. So why did you give us only 45 minutes? I told you that's all I had today, that's what you preferred. Never mind. We could've had several hours tomorrow. - Never mind. I actually thought about you lately. About those days... Hell of a time, huh? All the trips, the fights, our place on Mapu... Your belly-dancing... Flamenco. Right. Do you still dance? I wish. So what have you been doing all these years? Still living up in Acre? - Yes. You're just so polite. This meeting is such a nuisance to you, huh? You keep saying that, but it's not true. I really was happy when you called. What am I, some sales rep? Have you no shame? 45 minutes... Ronit, we're sitting, having a nice time, and we could meet again tomorrow... Also, you don't just dive in after 20 years, it could be awkward. - Never mind. I'm sorry... You know what I remember? How crazy you were about Veronique Sanson. You sang her songs all the time. Do you still listen to her? Does she still sing? Roniti... Why are you crying? I'm sorry. Please don't cry. I came all this way just to talk to you. Great. And we're talking. I'm sorry you feel so hurt. But sometimes, life's just... I didn't know this was so important. - Enough. When I moved back to Acre, after we split up, I found out I was pregnant. And I decided to keep it. And I had Adam. The most beautiful baby in the world. Two months ago he turned 19, such a special boy... I never told you because I knew you didn't want kids. You really didn't. And I didn't need any help from you, everything was fine. Everything was fine... Sorry, we're out of the ravioli. Give us a few minutes. Excuse me. Smadi, try to get my lawyer, Perry, I may need to talk to him. In about half an hour. Okay, bye. I'm sorry... Two weeks ago he took my car... he always does... and he had an accident... Up on a bridge... He fell off the bridge and he died... and I don't know what to do... I don't know what to do... You're his father. Aren't you his father? You need to know, I wanted to tell you... That's it. Ariel. Hi, Perry. - What's up? Smadi asked me to be available. - No, it's okay. What happened? - Nothing. It worked out. Happy New Year, everyone. Please welcome our 2015 employee of the year Avi Yekutieli! Our next employee, Emanuel Assis! Our next winner, llan Asraf. Thank you. And last but not least, Igor Feurmann. Thank you, good job. Igor, thank you. Now let's watch our factory's corporate video. Then we'll raise a toast to the New Year. Happy holiday. The holiday season is behind us. Back to our daily routine. Back to school, back to work. And back to traffic. Let's listen to some music. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm here for Adam Hilu's stone-setting. Is he buried here? -Yes. You can wait over there. Wasn't it meant to start already? - They're running late. Everyone? How can that be? The funeral was small, too. We're looking at a few people, tops. Wait over there. Please leave a message after the beep. Hi Ronit, it's Ariel. I'm at the cemetery. Are you on your way? Anyway, I'm here. I can't reach them. I'll start the prayer now. You're welcome to join me. Who was he to you? I'm... family. "...revive me in Your righteousness. "The Lord will have mercy "on the spirit and soul of Adam, son of Ronit, "the Lord will guide him to Heaven." If you'd like to say a few words... I don't think so... Anything at all. May he rest in peace. Hello? Ariel, this is Eli, Ronit's husband. Oh, hello. I'm just leaving the cemetery. We're so sorry, we just got your message. Ronit didn't think you'd come. Ronit's been in the hospital, she has an infection all over her body. They think it might be lupus. I'm really sorry. No, it's all right... How is she feeling? She's sleeping now and she'll probably be discharged later. We might even still make it. Since I'm here, shall I stop by at the hospital? She doesn't want anyone seeing her like this. I'll be in touch later if you'd like to wait. Okay. I'll be expecting your call. - Okay. I'll be here at... the Palm Hotel. - Okay. And again, I'm sorry. Bye. It's all right. Bye. Hello? -Good evening, sir. You have a guest in the lobby. Okay, I'll be right down. Just, who is it? Hi. Ariel Bloch, room 11. Ariel? Hi. I'm Mickey. Adam's best friend. Nice to meet you. Ronit and Eli told me you were here. They're not discharging her today. Probably tomorrow. They'll be in touch. Okay. Could we...? - Yes, sure. He would've been so happy to meet you. You think so? - Totally. Were you in school together? Yeah, our school's just across the street. The building with the steeples. Adam and I both played music. Adam, the piano. I play the cello. Adam played the piano? He was a genius. Played Bach like nobody's business. A crazy romantic. That's amazing. How about other stuff? Sports? Soccer? Acre F.C. We're their wildest fans. And... how about a girlfriend? Did he not like girls? - Why, because I look gay? No, not at all. Just because... you smiled. Adam was really into girls, unfortunately... but they weren't too interested, mainly because of his leg. What do you mean? One leg was two inches shorter, but you could hardly tell. He wore a high-heel shoe and hid it with long pants. So he had a limp? No, the heel took care of that. And when he wasn't wearing it? Never happened. Ronit didn't tell me. Ariel, I'm also here to ask you something. And I hope you'll agree. What is it? Adam and I were always short on cash. It may sound bad, but we decided to buy some hash and sell it to friends. It was just a kilo. A kilo?! Yeah, but it's not hard drugs, so no biggie. So when Adam died, he had the stash and the dealer wants his money. It's 8K, and I just don't have it. So I thought you could help with Adam's share... What, finance a drug deal? Even if we made a mistake, you're Adam's father. You can help me out of a huge mess. I will not finance my son's drug deals. I'm really in trouble. I really can't help you. Please... I'm sorry, I can't. But why? I'm sorry. No, you're not. I hear you're loaded. You have a factory... you could really help me out. Okay. Maybe it's better Adam never met you. He'd be ashamed of you right now. He'd be ashamed of you. Sorry, I'll wait outside. Can I help you? I'm Ariel, Adam's father. Adam Hilu. Oh, hello... We were all devastated to hear. I'm truly sorry for your loss. You have my deepest sympathies. - Thank you. Please, have a seat. Can I offer you anything? - No, thank you. Rauda is our school counselor. It's a terrible loss. A terrible loss. Such a charming boy. Such intelligent eyes. Always kept to himself, but you could feel his strength. He was special. Truly remarkable, your son. Thank you. What do you mean, kept to himself? Didn't he have friends? Unfortunately we have very few students from that side of town. We do make an effort but those students tend to keep to themselves. Perhaps he didn't need many friends, he had himself. I see... I was just looking at the class pictures and I didn't see him. He was no longer in school when those were taken. He never graduated? - Sadly not. Look, Adam did something very serious, we had to react severely. He sprayed graffiti, very vulgar things about his teacher, Yael. It was very humiliating for her. What kind of things? I suggest... There were wonderful things about Adam. He was one of our finest pianists. - He played beautifully. Thank you. I'd really like to know what sort of things he wrote. I'd like to know. I think it's a pity, but come have a look. There. The owners insist we paint the whole building so thus it remains. Is that French? I don't... Could you translate? Yes. Yael is also our French teacher. Here, I'll translate. "If you place one foot by the school gate and the other by the library "You can sit atop the middle school building "And let the steeple penetrate you. "If you tilt your body forward "You could rub your clitoris against the gymnasium roof. "And when you've finished moaning, "We'll sit here on the bench "I'll hold you, and we'll talk." It's a poem. I apologize for any offense taken, but it's a love poem. Forget the vandalism which is a criminal offense. This is about shaming. Stripping his teacher Yael before the entire school is terrible! Agreed. Obviously, if you write something sexual about your teacher it's a bit shocking, but... that's what poetry does. It's meant to shock you. It's lovely. It's a love poem. I can't believe you expelled him for that. - It's not a love poem. Anything's a love poem nowadays, this isn't! I'm sorry, this is who we are. Come on. The teacher was humiliated! We truly mourn with you... We have to go, the bell just rang. We have a staff meeting. I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't understand your behavior. You know what happens when you expel a student? You don't know. He starts selling drugs. Yes. Adam and his friend bought drugs to sell. Your poor decision to expel him makes you responsible. We really must go... You have to reinstate him. Our meeting... You have to reinstate him, give him his diploma, and add his photo to the class picture. To rectify the injustice you did to him. That's a request we can't... - You must. This is unbelievable. Let's see what we can do. I'll get back to you. Come. Are you Adam's dad? Yes. Why? We heard Adam's dad was here at school. Yes... who are you? 'Cause Adam's dad is dead. He drowned. - What do you mean, drowned? He was a pianist that drowned. Well, I was a pianist... I'm Lillia. I was his girlfriend. Nice to meet you. How old are you? You look so young. Fifteen. So there were four years between you? That's a lot at your age, no? No. He even lived with us. Why didn't he live at home? He fought with his mom and Eli all the time. So he didn't sleep at home at all? - No. He slept at ours. With his mouth open, like this, like a dead man. That's how he slept? - Yep. Did your parents like him? How did that work? My dad was in prison a lot. My mom spoiled him with good food and I was his woman. What boy wouldn't go for that? Right. Adam is the love of my life. I'll never love anyone like that. Ever. You're young, you'll have plenty of other big loves. Anyway, he was in love with someone else. Yael... his teacher. From the poem? Yes. What do you mean, in love with her? Was there something between them? No, but he thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. He talked about her all the time. Followed her around. After he died I found a notebook filled with poems he wrote about her. But she didn't want him so he always came back to me. Could I read that notebook? Sure. Hi Ronit, it's Ariel. I'm waiting to hear from you. Meanwhile I've met some of Adam's friends. I'm still at that hotel, I'm waiting for you to call. Bye. It was here. The accident. Yael! Hello. I'm Ariel. Adam's father. Hello. The principal told me he met you and you asked to add Adam's picture to the class photo. I think you're right. He's doing it. That's great, I'm glad. I'm also glad to meet you. Likewise. I feel like I know you. I spent last night reading his poems about you. This is all about you. Amazing. I discovered how beautifully he wrote. Yes, I'm familiar with this notebook, we talked about it a lot. Of course it couldn't be acted on. I was his teacher and there was the age gap. He never stops praising you. When you're in love, you endow your beloved with grand attributes. He also writes how sad you are. Funny... he loved my sadness. Funny. And you? Did you love him? I couldn't return the love he wanted but he knew I was very fond of him. Do you think he suffered? - No. He may have even enjoyed it a little. Really? - Yes. Really. I hope so. Well, nice meeting you. - You, too. Yael... I'm going to the cemetery now, it's a big favor to ask but if you could come with me to Adam's grave, it'd be great. That's a lovely thought, thank you for inviting me, but I can't right now, but... I'll go in the next few days. It's what Adam would've wanted most. Of course. I'll go. I'm going back to Tel Aviv... I don't know... I'd be so happy if you joined me. Can't you? I'm sorry, there's an event I must attend... How about after your event? Okay? I really... can't today but I promise in the next few days. I never did anything for him as a father, so I'd really like to do that now. But I promise I will. That's your doing. All right. All right. Yael, you could... You could make someone so happy. - It's not... I have to go. I can't understand... I'm standing here, begging. I don't get it. Please. What do you want from me? I said I'd go, didn't I? Why are you talking to me like that? Why? Why are you talking to me like that?! You have some responsibility here. A kid doesn't just fall in love. You must've done something. Are you crazy? Who are you, anyway?! Adam didn't have a father! Now leave me alone. Hello. Can I use your watering can? Here. Thanks. She's very beautiful. Thank you. I'm Ariel. Nice to meet you. Gideon. Your daughter? Yes. She's stunning. - Thank you. She really was. People couldn't take their eyes off her. Just like you. A redhead? Without a single freckle. She was an angel. Always the most beautiful creature in the room and I... I was the proudest father. But I was always afraid. What do you mean? Why? She was the best student and a talented violinist since she was seven. She was perfect and I was frightened. So I belittled her. Made up negative things to say to people about her. Because people... the jealousy, the evil eye... I knew it would come one day. She got sick? Suddenly, at the age of 12 our daughter became sad. As if something inside her had died. Never smiled anymore. On her 18th birthday she couldn't stand it any longer and she... We weren't at home. I'm not angry with her, not at all. She couldn't take it anymore. How sad. Adam. My son. 19 years old. Car accident. Do you and your wife come every day? No, just me. My wife Hila doesn't want to come. She carries on as if Abigail is still alive. Water's getting in there, you should seal the frame. "Palm Hotel" What... What is this? I'd like to take part in your lesson. I'm afraid that's a bit... The principal gave me permission. What permission? To take part in your lesson, in Adam's class. I understand... this was his class. Okay. It's a bit... but okay. All right. All right. I'd even like to sit in his seat, if that's possible. Okay. Then you need to move over there. Shiraz, can you move over? I'll just explain to the class. - Of course. Okay, kids, Ariel is Adam's father. Adam was a lovely student here and was killed in a car accident a month ago. You've all heard about it, I'm sure. Adam once told me his real father was dead. I was his neighbor. I know his stepdad Eli. Adam didn't know his father was alive. His mother never told him. I assume Ariel didn't know about Adam. Why didn't she tell him? Every family has its own reasons. These are private family matters. May I? Of course. Adam's mother never told me she was pregnant, she knew I wouldn't want the child. I'm sorry to say, she was right. I'll tell you something really hard. For as long as I can remember my father beat me terribly. Until I was 17. As an adult, every time I thought about having children I got scared. Scared that I'd beat them like my father beat me. This fear made me not want to have children. That's why she never told me about Adam. So you never had kids? We should respect Ariel's privacy... It's fine. I'm the one who brought it up. No, I never had children. Except Adam, of course. How did he beat you? With what? Anything. Usually a belt. Sometimes his bare hands or a stick. Kicks, too. He'd diversify. And what did you do? Nothing. I put my hands like this, to protect my head. Do you talk to him? Yes. Well, not exactly. He's in a nursing home and doesn't speak or remember much. So I just sit beside him. Do you love him? I think that's enough for now... No. I don't think I do. Ariel. Ariel. I wanted to thank you. And to apologize. Thank you. I wanted to apologize, too. We raised our voices a little. Yes. Weren't you going back home? Yes, but Adam's mother is getting out of the hospital so I'll visit her first. I can't go with you to the cemetery but if you'd like, we could go get some coffee. Great. - Okay. I'm sorry I didn't go with you. My father died a year ago, so it's still... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to pressure you. Adam was sweet. He got the whole class to write me condolence letters and brought me a pile this big. It was so full of love... so consoling. And once when I was crying he hugged me. It was a mistake, but I couldn't stop it. It was too close for a teacher and student. But did it feel good? Yes, I think so. I needed a hug, but still... A student can get confused... Yes. And the teacher, too? No, I don't think so. You couldn't have found yourself slightly in love with Adam? No. I have very clear boundaries. You can never be sure. Love is so unpredictable... What's for sure is that genetics are certainly at work here. You're very much alike. You're relentless. Relentless. But my biggest mistake with Adam was going to see his band play. Looks closed. Yes. Could that be the entrance? What are you doing? - Let's have a peek. Wait, there's someone inside. They played on that stage. Adam was in the corner on the piano and I sat at that table. Was there a big crowd? - It was packed, and Adam wouldn't stop looking at me. He must've been excited having you here, no? -Yes. But it was extreme, he didn't take his eyes off me. People started staring at me. And at the end, when we left, he came up and asked to kiss me. He was begging me to kiss him. And did you? No, of course not. Who's there? Sorry, we came in for a moment, we're leaving. This is where I live. Second floor. It was a pleasure. For me, too. I had a really nice time. This is the bench where Adam sat sometimes and watched up at me. For hours. Well... - Thank you, Yael. You're charming and special. I agree with everything Adam wrote about you. Thank you. Could I sit here on the bench and watch up a bit, too? You're joking. Not at all. Okay. Fine. See you. See you. Bye. Adam. Hi, Dad. You play beautifully. Really? - Beautifully. So, did you meet her? -Yes. She said wonderful things about you. So... you think she really likes me? If the circumstances were different she'd want to be with you. Really?! But under the circumstances... it's impossible. I'm aware of the circumstances. But Adam, sweetie, you can do something. You can meet someone else. There are so many wonderful girls, beautiful girls - blondes, brunettes, redheads with no freckles. It's starting. Come on. You can try it, too. No, that's all right... Hi Ronit, how are you? Hello. Eli? Ariel? Nice to meet you. Come on in. Please. She'll be right here. Please, have a seat. The sea. Relaxing. Yes, very. We're right on the beach now. We can move away if you like. Right on the beach is fine. It's not just the volume. It's the perspective, too. Very interesting. Hi, Roniti. Hi, Ariel. - How are you? Sorry about all this, I had an attack like this when I was 16, but nothing since. It's okay, I'm very glad I came. Very. I'll get something to drink. Did you walk around? - Yes. I visited Adam's school, I met Mickey and Lillia. Yesterday I met his teacher, Yael. She's lovely. I read the notebook with the poems he wrote about her. He writes beautifully, Ronit. I know I'm biased but there's true artistic value there. I'd even like someone in the field to have a look... You're discovering how wonderful he was. Yes... Did you see that notebook? No. And it's just as well. Why? He came to me in a dream and asked me to put her picture by his grave. Like an idiot I went to the cemetery and buried her picture right next to his grave. Here. What is this? - A police summons. She filed a complaint against him, that lovely teacher of his. -Yael? No way, she would've told me. That woman was his curse. You watch your child walking toward the abyss, you know nothing good will come of her and you can't say a thing. He was so in love with her. And with that love my poor boy died. But why the police? He sat on a bench by her house and wouldn't move. Just sat there. The last two weeks of his life, after he found out she was having an affair with the principal, he went crazy. - Which principal? Amnon? Yes. That can't be. - Yes, it can. What was she doing with that principal? He's so old. -Who cares? And he's so slick... So she likes slick men. What's that boat?! - It's the sea. Boats pass by. That sea doesn't relax me, it irritates me! There's one every 15 minutes. First one since he's been here. But it irritates me. Enough already with that sea. - Okay, I'll turn it down. Why would she call the police over such a thing? I don't get it. It doesn't matter anymore. In any case, thank you for coming. Really. Are you going back to Tel Aviv tonight? Tomorrow? Tomorrow, I guess. We decided not to have the stone-setting ceremony. Just the two of us will go. I'm really sorry, I'll invite you to every memorial service in the future, and if you can come... Hi, Ariel. What are you doing here? May I? - Of course. Come in. Could you explain this to me? When did this arrive? It came in the mail yesterday. At a certain point I had no choice, so I filed a complaint. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know... You were with me almost all day. Why didn't you tell me? Was it so meaningless? We talked and talked and the most important thing, you didn't tell me. Why? How could you file a complaint against Adam? He wouldn't leave me alone. - But why involve the police? He was your student. Why would a teacher call the police on a student who loves her? Are you crazy? One day you go to his gig and the next, you go to the police! I told you going to his gig was a mistake. - Whose mistake?! Yours! He writes you poems, brings you letters from the class, hugs you, the most innocent love, and you go to the police. It's humiliating! I couldn't take it. He sat on that bench night and day. So what? So you go to the police? It was the day of the accident! The police came, he ran away and had the accident. -I didn't know what to do. You killed him! You're crazy! You killed him! You're crazy, you idiot! It was abuse! He wouldn't leave me alone. He followed me everywhere. He threatened to hurt anyone I was seeing. He'd call and text all day to see where I was. He was ruining my life. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't stand him anymore. I'm sorry, Ariel, I hated him. I hated him, I'm sorry. Hope you enjoyed your stay. Thank you. - Have a nice day. You have to forget this woman. Enough. Hey. Care to join me? Today is Abigail's birthday, I brought some wine. Sure. Happy birthday. - Thank you. I had the picture framed like you said. It's waterproof, snowproof, you name it. I'm going back to Tel Aviv now. Cheers. - Cheers. It's so sad... If Adam had met Abigail he'd have fallen in love with her for sure. All his life would've changed, maybe things would've turned out differently. Sometimes I think about what would've happened if Abigail had fallen in love. I'm certain they'd have fallen in love. Her depression wouldn't have bothered him. He would've made her laugh and given himself to her, he would've written her poems, he would've fucked her. Adam was very sensual. He would've fucked her all the time. -Hey... I'm talking about being together. About love. Everything feels better, even sadness. Maybe they'll meet one day... They aren't going anywhere, right? They're wandering around... They'll meet... It's funny... During this terrible year of death and pain... Hila, my wife... We have Chinese workers on our farm, they're Taoists and they have a tradition, they told her that when one of their young girls dies they marry her off to a boy who also died. They believe the wedding will bring them together and perhaps live together wherever they are. So she decided to marry Abigail off. I found myself going with her to Chinese families who'd lost their sons to find a match for Abigail. You wouldn't believe it. Once we went to Italy to meet a Chinese family, it was a nightmare. Your wife, the most rational and wonderful person in the world, goes crazy before your very eyes. They actually make a match and have a wedding? -Yes. With guests and everything? - Yep, everything. It's not a bad idea. What isn't? This wedding business... It's beautiful. Even marrying Adam and Abigail like that... Are you kidding me? - Not at all. What do we have to lose? These are our loved ones. It's a great opportunity to be with them, celebrate with them. We'll have a little party. People will come, we'll talk about the kids, read poems. I know it sounds crazy but it's beautiful. Does it sound stupid? Yes. It would give them direction. Help them find each other. Just a small party. Anyway, it's no longer relevant. She's gone off the idea. Ronit would never agree to it, Adam's mother. What? - I'm sorry... Obviously it's extreme. You still need to digest it. - Sorry. Sorry. - It's okay, I knew you'd react this way. I won't laugh anymore. Ronit, I'm not some flighty guy. I'm not even spiritual. It's so crazy and farfetched, I don't even know what to say. Just an intimate party, not some over-the-top wedding. Ariel, I don't understand what's come over you. Neither do I. A few weeks ago I didn't even know I had a son and thanks to you, now I... Ronit, that girl, Abigail... I know it sounds crazy but she's beautiful, a redhead with the palest white skin, just the type Adam could've fallen in love with. Oh, and she was depressed, from the age of 12. At 18 she committed suicide, she couldn't take it anymore. He liked depressed girls, right? Yes... - We have to take action, Roniti. We have to help him forget that teacher. Adam is dead, Ariel. So is Abigail. They're in the same place now, all they need is a little push. Enough with this nonsense. I'm sorry, but it's enough. And putting her picture by his grave wasn't nonsense? -He asked me to. I dug it up, by the way- You dug up the picture? - Yes. Why? Because enough with that teacher. You're crazy, Ariel. Thanks for agreeing to come, Roniti. Let's be clear again, we're not talking about a wedding and all that insanity of yours. We're just going to meet a nice couple and talk about our kids. That's it. - Exactly. And you won't embarrass me. - Of course not. Hi. - Hello. I'm Hila. - Ariel. Hila. - Ronit. Gideon. -Please, come in. - What a lovely home. Hila did the decorating. - Beautiful. Wow, look at this! At least 20,000 calories, no? - We're thin, we're allowed. You are. He thinks I am, too. Wow, Turkish delight. I love it. Funny, my mother used to make this kind exactly. Do you like it? - Very much. So delicate. Do you manufacture it or import it? - No, not at all. It's the only sweet that Abigail likes. Did Adam like Turkish delight? - I was just wondering. It made me sad to think he may have never tried it. I hope he did. Two nice things happened to us today. Gideon found a recording we were looking for, Mozart's Violin Sonata No. 21 that Abigail played. That's what we're listening to. That's her playing? It's wonderful. She plays beautifully. Beautifully. I brought a piece of Adam playing, too. We can listen to it afterwards. Lovely. The other thing... Gideon, hand me the... It's so exciting... Unbelievable. Acre F.C., that's Adam's team. - She's the goalie. It's this year's photo, they photoshopped her picture in. I can't believe it. Did he also play for Acre F.C.? - No, I wish. He couldn't, but he was their biggest fan. Why couldn't he? - He had a problem with his leg. What kind of problem? One leg was two inches shorter than the other. He didn't limp. He wore a heel that was slightly higher, so it was unnoticeable, but playing soccer was a problem. But he was a huge fan. He went to every game, even the away games. So it's amazing that Abigail was on that team. Going to games together sounds idyllic. I used to take her to games. She was so happy when they scored. Just think, they went to the same games and shouted "Goal!" at exactly the same time. That's right. I'd like to say something... I'm feeling a little uncomfortable. Even though I know it's... something trivial and I may sound backward, but this matter of his short leg and the limp, I have a slight problem with that. Excuse me?! - But I told you there is no limp. This is the first I've heard about it. It just surprised me. This is my daughter and I have to look out for her. Are you crazy?! What's your problem? Have you no shame? I didn't want it to come to this. What are you talking about? Your daughter's depressed. She'll turn into a depressed woman. - Ronit. You know what it means to be a depressed woman? I can tell you. Ronit, she didn't mean... I've had enough of this nonsense. Thank you, it was a pleasure. But... Ronit... I don't want my son to be with a depressed woman. Find her someone else. - Ronit, she didn't mean it. You misunderstood. I'll talk to you later. She annoyed me, too. - Just leave me alone. Why are you talking to me like that? - I'm sick of this shit. What a disgusting woman. I'm such an idiot. So she's disgusting, you don't have to be friends. You'll meet them once, twice. How dare she talk about Adam that way? A disgusting woman with a disgusting daughter. Abigail is lovely, I could tell you liked her. - He could've had a thousand like her. But why ruin everything? There's a way to argue. You're just a kiss-ass. A kiss-ass? Some things are irreversible. Why burn bridges? You sat there, silent, then you even apologized: "The limp was unnoticeable." Disgusting. - All you can see is your pride. You idiot! -Your own pride! I can understand her. Even though I'm his father, when I first heard about his leg, it did something to me, it's disturbing. And I'm sure that when you were first told about it you took it hard. Because it's hard. So why can't you understand her? She just heard about it so it's hard for her. Stop here, please. Ronit, we're talking... - Stop here. Stop! Hi, can I get a coffee, please? - Sure. Problem with the car? No. I saw your wife get a taxi, I thought you were waiting for a tow truck. No... We had a little argument so she preferred to take a taxi. Do you like it weak or strong? Regular. Medium. Can your argument be resolved? - Yeah, no big deal. What about? Nothing, we were... My son's getting married, we went to meet the bride's parents. - Classic. Money? How much they're giving? You're giving? -No. Is it style? Are they "our type" of people? Am I right? Something like that. And the kids? The bride and groom, are they in love? Yes. Compatible, too. - If they're in love, it'll all work out. Yes. Promise me if it works out you'll have the wedding here? Where? How many people? It's a small wedding, but still... Come. Bring your coffee. Come. Is it a deal? The wedding's here? I wish. Hello, Eli. How are you? - Fine, thank you. May I? Ronit isn't here. When will she be back? I have no idea. All right. What? Did she tell you we had a fight? Yes. - I wanted to apologize. So do Abigail's parents... I'll try again later. Okay. See you. - See you. Ariel? Can we talk? I've been debating whether to talk to you. I think what you're doing is vulgar. This whole wedding is a joke. I've never heard of anything more ridiculous. But if it's going to happen, I have to be involved, in everything. I'm his father, I raised him. You can't just show up and ignore me. You talk to Ronit and decide with Ronit, you go visit the bride's parents. What's that about? If there's going to be a wedding or anything else related to Adam, I need to be involved. Listen, Eli, I'm an idiot. Of course you're his father, too, and of course you need to be involved. I'm sorry, forgive me. I didn't mean to offend you. I'm sorry. All right. It's okay... She's calmed down a bit. Yesterday she told me how she upped and left. We had a good laugh about it. Really? Yeah. She felt like an idiot. She said she'd call to apologize. That would be great. She told me that Abigail is really beautiful. She's stunning. Well, this is the place. If it's too cold, I have heaters over there. I'll put up some fabric to make it look nice. I usually put the tables here, so there's a sea view, and I'll place the bride's chair over there. All the guests will go greet her. I can put a red carpet, too. If you'd like. No, we don't need the chair, either. Then where will the bride sit? This wedding is a little different. As you wish. Hello, Lillia, how are you? Fine. What is it? Good to see you. What's this thing you're doing? What thing? The wedding. It's not really a wedding. It's a little party for us parents. You can't do this. Sweetheart, it's a little party. Invitations have already been sent... Invitations? How can you marry Adam off? Lillia, this isn't meant to hurt you. How can it not hurt me? He's my boyfriend. The love of my life. And who is this Abigail, anyway? This wedding is not happening. Lillia, Abigail was a lovely girl who committed suicide and this wedding is between two dead people. You're alive, you must carry on with your life. You're alive and they're dead. - They're not dead. To me, he's still alive. It's impossible, people already know. There's a venue, even a flamenco player. Call off the flamenco player, call the whole stupid thing off! Lillia... Adam wouldn't want it. Adam isn't here. - He is! Lillia... His child is here. What do you mean? Exactly what it means. What does it mean, his child? His child. Adam has a child? - Yeah. Where? Here. - Where? Here. Are you pregnant? Yeah. And you want to keep the baby? I want to, but I can't. Why not? We arranged for an abortion, my parents will never agree. Can I talk to them? No. I'm not allowed to talk about it with anyone, especially you. If it were only up to you, would you keep it? I'm only 15... Right. They say I'm too young and it'll ruin my life. My dad will never agree. Can I please talk to them? - He won't agree. Please, Lillia. All right. I'll talk to them. I'll tell them I told you. Well... we've listened to you out of respect for your grieving but we've made up our minds. The abortion's tomorrow and that's final. Yes, of course. I'd just like to add that Adam is my only child. Ronit is going through the worst hell a person can endure, and I'm only just starting to understand, to feel... and suddenly there's a chance. Suddenly there's Adam's child. And he's here. And there's a grandma and grandpa, and another grandma and grandpa, and a mother. This child has a wonderful family... - Of course, but we're not... No. Just promise you'll think about it again. - Okay. All right. There's nothing to think about! Still, we're hoping... There's nothing to hope for or think about and that's that! Why are you talking to us like that? Do you like the tea? Yes... Did you say thank you? What do you mean? - Enough, Alex. We served it to you 5 minutes ago. Did you say thank you? I don't remember. I suppose I did. - No, you didn't. Maybe, but that's because I'm upset and wasn't paying attention. Three years your kid lived in this house. Three years he slept in this house. Three years he ate in this house. Did you ever thank her? Thank me? Did you ever ask if we need anything? Three years! I guess it was hard for me that he chose to live with you and that made me resentful. Your sweet boy thanked me by stealing 6,000 shekels. You knew about it. Did you show up with the money? "He's my son, I'm responsible." No! Because you piss on us, just like your darling little boy. We took him in, put him in my mother's room. My mother, an angel on earth, who lay all day in bed reading books and vomiting. And when your boy wanted to fuck my 12-year-old daughter, he thought my mother might wake up, so he'd put sleeping pills in her food so he could fuck my daughter in peace. My wife would call me in prison, telling me my mother sleeps all day, we thought it was her old-age. But no, he was drugging her. Your son was a fucking asshole. Black dog, invalid piece of shit... Enough swearing, it's not nice. Shut up! - Alex, your probation. -Shut up! Look... They were both kids. When she was 12, he was 16. It was youthful foolishness... Shut your mouth! Alex! - You're crazy! You mustn't, Alex, stop! You're crazy! Shut up! - I won't shut up! You're crazy! That boy is wonderful! He's not a piece of shit, a black dog or an asshole! He's wonderful. He's loved. He's handsome and talented and he fucked your daughter because he loved her and she loved him. - You're a dead man! Shut up! I envy her, I envy all of you for knowing him. He's wonderful. Let's go. He's a wonderful boy. Fuck off, asshole! - Enough! You fuck off. We're pressing charges. I'm sorry, did I wake you? I waited until it was daylight. I've been wandering all night. I didn't go to the police, I'm going crazy, I don't know what to do. I can't stand thinking that baby is going to die... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, I couldn't sleep all night. I feel like I'm losing my mind. There must be a solution, I'll give everything I have, I have a factory, I'm well-off, I'll give it all to Lillia and this child. Sometimes money can help. She'll have nannies and help, she can keep seeing her friends, whatever she wants. I don't need anything for myself. I just want this child to grow up. It'll help, won't it? What else can I do? There's nothing you can do. I'm sorry. With all due respect to your situation... This child can't be killed. It can't be... This girl can't be killed, either. I'm sorry. I'm closing the door now. - Wait, please... Enough... - Wait! He's right, she's just a little girl... She has to keep doing what kids do. He did what a good father is supposed to do. Adam, my son... I don't know what kind of father I'd have been... but I do know I was wrong all these years. I'd never, ever... ever... I'd never beat you. Ever. Where's Ariel? Ariel. Come on... No. Come on, already.
