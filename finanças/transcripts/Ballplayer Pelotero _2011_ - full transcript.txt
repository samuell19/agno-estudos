[MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [CHUCKLES] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: 20% of professional baseball players in the United States in the minor and major leagues combined come from the Dominican Republic. 1 in 5-- a staggering number considering the island's population is 2% of the United States. No one knows for sure, but it's estimated over 100,000 young players, or peloteros, train full time in thousands of programs across the island. And they all have one dream-- to sign a professional contract on signing day, July 2. This is the story of two peloteros. [CRACK] [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: Jean Carlos Batista is a 16-year-old shortstop. He comes from a town an hour away and boards at the dorm of his trainer, Astin. [SPEAKING SPANISH] ASTIN JACOBO: He looks good. The kid need some polishing, and I'm almost sure that I'll get him signed. We have our ground to cover. We have five months in front of us before July 2 comes around. [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: One field over from Astin's is Moreno Tejeda's program. [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: Miguel Angel Sano is a 15-year-old shortstop who's been training with Moreno since he was 12. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -He not only has bat and projecting is your bat speed. But the upside to the size of his arm, I think he's the top player that's been here for a long time. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -I love you. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPORTS ANNOUNCER] NARRATOR: The 1962 San Francisco Giants featured four of the first Dominicans to play the majors-- Felipe and Matty Alou, Manny Mota and Juan Marichal. At a time when the Giants were signing American prospects for bonuses of $60,000, the team paid less than $5,000 in total for these four Dominican players who helped them win the National League pennant and would go on to play in a combined 16 all-star games. [SPORTS ANNOUNCER] Major league teams knew a good thing when they saw it. In the '80s, they started pouring millions into the Dominican Republic. They built training facilities and hired staff to scout the talent on this impoverished island. And MLB established a set of rules. The youngest a player can sign is 16. The first day they become eligible is July 2. This system has yielded enormous returns. [SPORTS ANNOUNCER] For the past 20 years, the Dominican system has produced superstar after superstar at bargain basement prices. When top American prospects were signing for over a million dollars, future all-stars Miguel Tejada, Vladimir Guerrero, and David Ortiz signed for less than $4,000 each. The run up to July 2 is a grueling marathon for try outs for young players who have five months to prove their worth to scouts from Major League teams. Today is John Carlos's first tryout with the Houston Astros. [SPEAKING SPANISH] ASTIN JACOBO: It's very tough for a young kid to be looking at a person who's going to decide what his future's going to be. Right there is, you're recklessly nervous thinking, you know, is this the guy who's going to sign me? Is this is the guy who's going to give me the money so I can buy a house for my mom? That's a lot of pressure on you. Ah, was an outside pitch. -Jean Carlos see his mother probably once a week, sometimes two weeks and he doesn't see his mother. But he sees me every day, and he spends 6, 7, 8, 10 hours a day with me. We eat together, we ride together, we sing together. We are in the field together. He tells me, "You know I don't have no father, so you my father." NARRATOR: This signing season is being watched closely by baseball insiders with all eyes on Miguel Angel and just how high his bonus might go. NARRATOR: Miguel Angel and Jean Carlos are coming onto the market following a record breaking year. In 2008, the previous year, the Oakland A's signed pitcher Michael Inoa for $4.25 million dollars-- almost double the previous record. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh yeah. No question. NARRATOR: Trainers like Moreno and Astin do not get paid for coaching their players. Most players could not afford that anyway. Trainers work on commission. If a player does not sign, the trainer sees nothing for years of work. But if a player does sign, trainers take as much as 35% of the player's signing bonus. NARRATOR: Most trainers act as agents for their players, but elite prospects like Miguel Angel have professional agents to handle negotiations for them. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -I started doing this in 1996, and I basically broker Dominican 16-year-olds to Major League baseball teams. But Miguel Angel, I've never had a guy this good. I don't think it's close, either. It's a long process, but when the teams have seen him sufficiently, I can work out a deal for him to sign on July 2 and negotiate, hopefully, the biggest bonus I can possibly negotiate. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] ROB PLUMMER: I've loaned and invested money in him that I feel comfortable I'm going to get a good return on. ROB PLUMMER: Like, the family weren't living to where I thought that somebody who needed to have his mind focused on baseball was living. They had rotted-out mattresses. And so I offered to help them move to a different place. [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: 16 is the magic number for Dominican prospects-- the age MLB allows them to sign, the age they command the biggest bonuses. After 16, a player's market value drops precipitously, and that's led to rampant problems. For years, Dominican players have used steroids and hormones to make their 16-year-old bodies mature faster, though testing now makes that hard to get away with. Just as common are players lying about their ages, even their identities. -A lot of that happens from the emphasis that they want young guys that could play baseball as go man, you know, and that's kind of hard to happen. It gives guys motivation to be 16. Because that's when they get paid. NARRATOR: Years of scandal came to a head after the Washington Nationals signed 16-year-old Esmailyn Gonzalez for $1.4 million. Three years later, a reporter discovered he was really Carlos Lugo, 20 years old at the time he signed. Since then, MLB has ramped up the investigation process and teams are on high alert for the slightest hint of fraud. -Think this guy is gonna play in the major league, guys. I really think so. He's got what it takes. The interest on him has increased a lot. ASTIN JACOBO: We're looking at a real player. He smells like a major leaguer. He does. -Thank you. -Yeah. -He plays a few pitches. He was playing ping pong with them. Do they like it? Yes, they know him. You never know. [MUSIC PLAYING] -In baseball, you can't look at today. You got to be able to look at tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. When I look at today, I like it. When I look at tomorrow, I love it. And when I look at the day after tomorrow, it's so awesome, I can't believe it. Feels good. NARRATOR: With two months until July 2, Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, and Minnesota Twins have emerged as front runners to sign Miguel Angel. Rene Gayo, the Pittsburgh scouting director, has set up a private tryout at Moreno's field. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BABY CRYING] NARRATOR: MLB now investigates every Dominican prospect to verify their age and identity. [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: For a player like Miguel Angel, high profile and likely to cost millions, the scrutiny is even more intense. NARRATOR: And with rumors of fraud circulating, MLB orders Miguel Angel to undergo an extraordinary battery of tests. NARRATOR: If MLB fines that Miguel Angel is lying, it's a mandatory one-year suspension before he can sign or get a visa to play in the United States. NARRATOR: After a series of successful tryouts, Jean Carlos's stock is on the rise, and MLB begins the standard investigation into his background. -And though I have looked through his papers and everything, but I haven't done this great investigation that you have to do, and you got to make sure, because I been-- you know, I got caught one time with that. With Manuel Sanchez. He turn out to be Julio Sanchez instead of Manuel. -OK. When guys are doing something wrong, usually you could see, because, you know, I'm a coach. I been around kids a lot. When something wrong, they give you a little hint. And I say I haven't seen that-- not on him, not on his mother. [MUSIC PLAYING] ROB PLUMMER: Major League Baseball, they haven't found a single shred of evidence that shows any-- isn't his age. This whole system, the way it's working against Miguel, it kind of seems like, you know, he's guilty until proven innocent. [CROWING] -Today is July the 1st, a day that we definitely like here in the Dominican Republic, especially guys like me. Because tonight, after 12 o'clock, 12:01, guys are going to be eligible to sign. [TELEPHONE RINGING] This is the kind of a day when you receiving phone calls. They putting their numbers together and they gonna come up with whatever they say they think it's worth. Let's put our head together and try to do something about that. And this hope that we get-- what we want, $1,500,000. That's a go. NARRATOR: While July 2 is signing day, July 1 is the day when contracts are negotiated. The door is still open for players to negotiate and sign after July 2, but typically, the top players sign on to activate the largest bonuses. Signing after July 2 usually means smaller bonuses, as teams have less money available, if any, to sign other free agents. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello? -I broke the news to him, and he kind of looked around and say, you know, why he was getting that amount of money when other kids were getting more money. I say, you know, this is reality. This is what we have here and now. NARRATOR: Desperate to sign, Miguel Angel and his family turn to the Dominican Baseball Commission, a government agency that advocates for players. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -That's my boy. I love him. [LAUGHS] I really love him. That's my boy. That's my boy. That's my boy. [SHOUTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Post July 2, Miguel Angel and Juan Carlos are still eligible to sign, but both are in limbo. After Juan Carlos turned them down, the Houston Astros signed another Dominican shortstop for $370,000. Miguel Angel has still not received any offers as teams are waiting for MLB to conclude its investigation. NARRATOR: Finally, on July 24, months after they launched Miguel Angel's investigation. MLB releases the results. NARRATOR: While they conclude that he is who he says he is, they state his age is "undetermined." By undetermined, MLB investigators mean they don't have enough evidence to verify or disprove that media Miguel Angel is 16. The message to teams is, sign Miguel Angel Sano at your own risk. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: After the meeting with Renee Gayo, the Sanos gave the hidden tape to Miguel Angel's agent, Rob Plummer. ROB PLUMMER: I actually tried to show the tape to other teams, or, but the teams don't want to hear, he's 16 years old. They want to believe that they don't have to pay him that much money. Because if you can pay him $2 million, not $5 million, well, then you're going to try to pay him $2 million. It kind of smells like collusion to me. I'm not saying we're going to sign for like, $5 million or $4.5 million or break anyone's bonus anymore, but Major League Baseball might have an interest in trying to keep the bonuses down. [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: Juan Carlos's investigation has been delayed in a backlog at the MLB office. -You see that his mother give him breath-- was at the bottom. He was supposed to be somewhere in the middle. Because he was born on the 15th. It's a little odd. If this kid could not be signed, then they really have taken advantage of me. That really throws our work out the window. We got to find out exactly what's going on. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HONKS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] -And repeat it after me. Hello. My name is-- My name is-- Hello, my name is Miguel Angel. I am from Dominican Republic. My favorite baseball player [INAUDIBLE]. Is. Is [INAUDIBLE]. Nice to meet you. Nice. Nice to meet you. And to the class-- Welcome. Welcome to the class. Very good. Ah, next. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -They lie, him and his mom. I went to his school. I find out on the third grade, he was born in 1991. And then the fourth grade, was '92. Basically, he's 17 turning 18. I confronted his mother, and that's when she admitted the truth. I was naughty, mad, you know, because my reputation went down the drain. And I was out there pushing my player, working with my guy, telling everybody about all the wonderful things he could do as a baseball player that he could still do. I mean, he's a great ball player. But he was lying. NARRATOR: Major League Baseball suspends Jean Carlos for lying about his age. [SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: He will not be able to sign for another year, ensuring a much smaller signing bonus. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Things with Jean Carlos did not end up as good as we wanted to, and the relationship is not the same. It's just that when somebody lies to you, it's not-- never the same. -Jean Carlos can say whatever he wants to say. When they changed the age on Jean Carlos, he was already 10. I don't know anything that happens, that happens when I was a little kid. Come on. If you're 9 when you're in the 3rd grade, and you're 9 when you in the 4th grade, I mean, you can't be 9 for 700 days, you could only be 9 for 365 days. And Jean Carlos is very bright. Always been very smart. Things like that are just not going to pass on him. Jean Carlo was a liar before. And he's still a liar. And he's always going to be a liar.
