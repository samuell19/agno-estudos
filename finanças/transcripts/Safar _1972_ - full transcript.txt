Hey! I've found an address. It's for real this time. Look! This time it will be right. Let's go after him. Meantime, we'll check cinema's posters. Please come! Please come! It's the last time. I've find their place. I'm telling you the truth, I've got money too. Look! It's not gonna work out for today. Master is watching. Go on your own, Go. I'll get lost if I go alone. I'm scared of getting lost. Please come. Go! I guess, they'll give you a big reward. I'm not coming. Understand? He'll beat me and cut off my salary. What are you doing? Who's there? - Nobody Master. - You hustler... - Swear to God, you wanna beat me. - Wait! Eventually you will return, And I'll teach you a lesson. Master kicks you out this time. - Where did you find one of these every day? - Why do you care so much? - I'll return at night and won't let you... - Let him go. You wanna wait until then? If I find my dad, I'll get along with him. You know, he's very powerful. How do you know that they're your parents? I know, I had a dream. It's for sure this time. They're my parents. We will find them. He kicked me out, Asshole! When I find my father, I'll tell him to find you a better job. - Yes, It's easy for him. - He's powerful and also rich. Let's go. Let's go. Your address is far away, Do you have enough money? - We'll walk. - You can't. It's far, far away. - We've walked more than that in the past. - As you wish. I wouldn't go like this if I were you. Coward! Coward! I'm not the right guy for this. So we have to walk. Do you know how far it is? Let's take a shortcut. We have to ask around about it. You have taken the wrong road. You've made your path longer. Which way should we go now? You have to ask around. You have to ask around. You have to ask around. - I'm tired, really tired. - They will prepare food for us. They won't do that for me. You're their child. I won't take a bite if they do that. What have they thought? You're my friend. - You quit your job because of me. - They kicked me out. I won't take a bite. I will have to return and beg to get my job back. And cry in front of them. No, I won't let you go. You have to stay with me. - You won't occupy any space. - I'm hungry. When they realize how difficult it was for us to find them... Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Please let me go! Let him go! Just let me go! Let me go! When are we going to find them? I'm not hungry anymore. Who says that we were hungry at first place. If you don't nag, it will get better by its own. Just for one second, don't nag! - At least, let's get some sleep somewhere. - Sleep? - We won't get there, if we sleep. - To hell with that. To hell with it. I'll go. I don't know why I come along with you every day ? Because deep down, you know we will find them one day. If I was at the store, I would have eaten something. Seriously, he will beat you. I Wish you hadn't come with me. You like it, Don't you? What about the reward? What about the job you promise me? One day, one of these addresses is going to be right. - that day is today. - Is this one of those that you make up? - Me? Make up? - Yeah, You've done it hundred times. You think that I don't realize? Everytime, you came and told me that someone is waiting for you. Well, I was searching after my parents. Why are you yelling? Shut up. Don't you realize that everyone is sleeping? God, this candle is mine. Please accept my prayer, God. Accept mine, not hers. It's not far away. You have to reach tall trees. You have to reach tall buildings. It's not far away. You have to get there. You have to get there. You have to. - My legs, I can't walk anymore. - Your legs? I'm in a lot of pain. Let's fantasize about their looks, to forget about it. I'm afraid of them. Let's fantasize, to not scare anymore. Let's talk about their looks. You always speak about these. How is your father looking alike? How is your mother looking alike? I haven't met them. They haven't met me either. You liar, You told me that your father is tall. You said, "he is very powerful." Haven't you told me that your mother has green eyes? Of course, but they're waiting for me. I remember that, You are forgetting to talk about their house. They will prepare food for us. If you're hungry, you have to wait. - They will look after us. - They may pass out. They may even cry happy tears. Shut up. I can't stand their cries. What will happen if they won't give me reward? I can't get back to work. - They certainly do. - You're telling this every day. I will break their windows if they wouldn't, All of them. - You wanna break our windows? - I will insult them. - Don't you dare insult my family. - Damn! You make us miserable. My legs, my stomach, my wounds. Damn! How dare you insult my family? Don't hurt my new wounds. Watch out! my wounds. Wow, see. Look, tall buildings. We were not fighting. Just imagine it doesn't happen at all. Well, let's take a photo together. It's gonna be a good memento. We will remember each other by looking at it. Come. One... Two... So kids, prepare your money. Shall we? Won't you come upstairs to get your reward? If I return soon, Master may give my job back. You wanna return to that job? He will eat you alive. If they want that, tell them to find me a job. Hang on for two more days, We will get you out. Goodbye. I hope you won't get lost. I'll miss you. I wish you could see. Goodbye. How old are you? 12. Our baby would be 10. Can it be 12 instead of 10? I'll sleep in the kitchen. Even in basement. No! I can work. I know how to clean up. No! You know that you don't belong to anyone. Why would you come after me everyday? I will get another address for tomorrow
