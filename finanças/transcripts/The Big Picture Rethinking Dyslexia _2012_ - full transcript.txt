-We were called on to read out loud. I would tremble. I was afraid. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): You couldn't hide. Everyone was looking at you. -The words just come out wrong. -I would sit at the back of the class. I would look at the blackboard, and it was just gobbledy-goop to me. -All I knew was that I couldn't do what other kids were doing. -Grades were bad. Self-esteem started to collapse. I remember faking being sick all the time. -What I was keeping secret was I really wasn't an A student. -I could tell, I just wasn't that confident. -I sat at a table while-- during free time while the other kids were reading books. I couldn't read. -It wasn't until I got the diagnosis that I was really-- it was like, oh, my god. I understand it now. [music playing] -I was actually looking at this desk 'cause of all the things I've carved into it. And I got this star for completing Boys' Day. It was funny, because I think when I did, when I find signed up the thing for my name, I must have spelled my name wrong. Because on this star for completing Boys' Day, my name is D-Y-A-N. So it's kind of ironic, going to Boys' Day and yet my name's spelled wrong on the star certificate thing. Kind of just sums everything up. KYLE (OFFSCREEN): The big early red flags for me were-- this is really embarrassing, because I had this whole sense that I couldn't wait to teach my child, because I'd been teaching other kids. I had every trick in the world. I had tricks for memorizing math facts. I had tricks for penmanship. I taught every single subject. I couldn't wait to teach my own son. I thought we were going to-- we were going to make history. [laughs] And boy, I got slammed really early on. He didn't learn to write his name. He didn't learn the alphabet. His friends, who were either younger than him or the same age, were just sailing right past him. I can remember-- I think this is in fourth grade or third grade. Now that we were such good readers at that point, we had to go read to the kindergartners. I basically tried to memorize-- I think it was-- I think it was "The Cat in the Hat," actually. Finally, when the day came to go and read to the kindergarten class, sitting on this stool being surrounded by these little kids staring up at you, with these cherubic faces and these beady little eyes, and I started and right off the bat I was stuttering and misplacing words, and it was so bad. Like halfway through, the kindergartners were starting to correct me. I remember being probably as nervous as I had been at that point in my life. I would work so hard, and teachers would just think that I'm-- that I was slacking off, that I wasn't doing my work, that I wasn't trying hard enough. I just felt like I was constantly trying to catch up, and it was just to no avail. I just felt like I was never going to be normal. I mostly just wanted to be normal at that point. KYLE (OFFSCREEN): The minute we went in for an evaluation in first grade, I asked the learning evaluator to look at whether or not he was dyslexic. And she said, oh, no, this is way too early. We never diagnose for dyslexia until third grade. And of course now, we know that that is not at all the case. In fact, the earlier the diagnosis, the better. I remember when Dylan heard the name, and it contained it for him. It was-- all of a sudden, it wasn't that he just had a bad brain or a broken brain. It was that he was dyslexic. And it was a certain kind of breakdown, but it didn't affect his entire brain. But frankly, at our school, we were very scared of students with his profile and really didn't feel like we could do right by them. I had to tell my class that I was going to be leaving for the majority of the day, when I was in fourth grade, to go to this learning specialized program. I realized it's better for people to understand what I have than not and be left in the dark and be left to make up their own conclusions. [music playing] DR. SALLY SHAYWITZ (OFFSCREEN): Probably reading is one of the most complex abilities that we as humans have. Speaking is natural. It's instinctive. We know it's been around for hundreds and hundreds of thousands of years, and our brains are hardwired for spoken language. Written language has been around 5,000 years, and our brains are not naturally hardwired for writing, for reading. -Hi, Carol. Hi, Dr. Shaywitz. -So we got an invitation. I just wanted to go over it with you. -Oh? OK. -Sally and I became very interested in dyslexia quite naturally. Sally is a developmental pediatrician. I'm a child neurologist. DR. SALLY SHAYWITZ (OFFSCREEN): And the most common problem each of us see is learning problems. And by far and away, dyslexia accounts for 80% to 90% of all learning problems. So many people ask me, could I be dyslexic? And it's so common, but yet so many people are not identified. So at the Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity, we've developed a small card that we give out to people. "You may be dyslexic if you read slowly and with much effort, but you're often the one to solve the problem. You can't spell and have messy handwriting, but your writing shows terrific imagination. You have trouble remembering dates and names, but you also think out of the box and grasp the big picture. You have difficulty retrieving and pronouncing spoken words, but you also have an excellent vocabulary and great ideas." Really importantly, it lists the weaknesses, but it also lists the strengths. When I first started working with children who had dyslexia, it was a different world. We didn't have the science. And children were actually asked to walk balance beams. They had visual training, all sorts of things. Because at that time, we didn't know, what's the basic cause? Why should otherwise intelligent children have trouble learning to read? -OK. We're very fortunate to be working with and interested in this at a time when the technology, functional brain imaging, became possible. So what he is looking at now is tasks that are projected on the screen. The task that's most central is looking at nonsense words and telling us whether the nonsense words rhyme. We can compare and examine the differences between groups of people who have dyslexia compared to groups of people who don't. DR. SALLY SHAYWITZ (OFFSCREEN): We now understand that there's an area of the left side of the brain in the back the brain that is necessary to read automatically. When you read automatically, it means you don't even have to pay attention. You see something, you know it. If you're dyslexia, you can't do that. It's still manual. You have to pour out so much energy and so much attention, it takes you longer. -The imaging has made dyslexia just as real as any other medical disorder. And the great advance is that for the first time, we have made a hidden disability visible. BONNIE (OFFSCREEN): Some of the myths are that dyslexics see words in reverse, that we're using some sort of Da Vinci code when we're trying to read. -Oh, you're dyslexic? Oh, could you read backwards? -The most annoying aspect of it is when people equate a learning disability with a thinking disability. -I don't really didn't get-- like, it doesn't go away. And what really annoys me is when people say, like, oh, yeah, I had dyslexia once. Yeah. Well, yeah. I had it. It's gone now. Just, no, it's not-- that's just not how that works. -All language is in code. So you're writing, whether it's Japanese, English, German, the page is in some code. And you learn to look at that code and convert it to sound and then to meaning. -S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G? -Most people who are good readers, it becomes a very highly repetitious thing, and they don't have to go through the sounding, the grinding away in the same laborious way that-- you know, people who suffer with dyslexia have to do that. -There are symbols that they don't seem to have any real significance to me. The hardest part, I think mostly, is understanding, you know, usually what they sound like. I mean, looking at a book, it just takes so long because there's so many letters, these symbols, all over the page. I skip sentences. I get words mixed up all the time. I spell completely phonetically. Understanding what letter goes where and why that letter makes that sound in that place? Like, I don't understand that. Why is it like that? Oh, this picture was me in first grade at Riverdale. Yeah. This picture was taken at school. And there are the kids reading over there, but I couldn't read yet, so I would just sit at my table and draw. [traffic noises] GERALYN (OFFSCREEN): Remember we had the big sleepover at the school for Skye. -My first memory of the word dyslexia-- it's so funny. I-- I was dating my husband Tyler, and he had sent me this love letter, and he misspelled five words. I remember turning to my mom and saying, wow, that's so interesting. This guy is so smart and there are all these misspellings. What do you think was going on when he wrote this? And she said, oh, he's probably dyslexic. He's brilliant. He's a surgeon. He's probably dyslexia. The next time I heard the word was when I was being told Skye, my daughter, probably had it. SKYE (OFFSCREEN): I remember the day when I got my first homework packet. And I remember, like, sitting on the school bus, and I was asking a friend, how do I do this? And I just couldn't understand it at all. I hated school. I did not want to go to school. I just want to not go to school. -I would get calls from the nurse's office almost every other day. They said, we have never seen a child with so much performance anxiety. SKYE (OFFSCREEN): I would pretend I was sick. I would be tired in the morning. 'Cause when I went there, I wouldn't understand anything. I felt like I wasn't learning anything. -After the stomachaches and just kind of, you know, trying to figure out what was going on, I decided to have her tested. When I got her tested, I was told it was dyslexia. I was so relieved. It felt like going to the doctor and being told what's wrong with you, and it wasn't her fault. And I remember being so excited to tell the school, oh, this is good news, this is what it is. OK? So we can all like-- and it was just unbelievable, the response I got. It was, she needs to leave the school. TYLER (OFFSCREEN): The hardest thing for us to deal with was trying to convince the school where she was to have an interest in her, and to make an investment in her. They had decided that because of her difficulties in reading, that she would have difficulties in just learning everything. GERALYN (OFFSCREEN): I felt so badly for Skye, and I remember thinking, like, where does she belong? And how traumatic to start off school thinking that she can't succeed in first grade. SHEREE (OFFSCREEN): For Sebastian, it's just-- what do you think? -Saying the words. -Saying the words. -Yeah, like-- -And it being corrected by your sister. Maybe that's annoying. -Yeah, that's the most annoying thing. SHEREE (OFFSCREEN): Sebastian was very creative, and that was clear from a young age. He loved Legos, and he loved building things. And so it was clear that he's a bright child. But when he started to have to write, compose, his spelling was just really scary. I started to buy these reading programs, and I tortured my son. Tortured him. And we received a diagnosis from professionals. -I didn't know what dyslexia was. But then when I learned, like, what's it all about, it wasn't really that much a surprise to me. -Each individual person has a unique experience. And some part of it requires that person to figure out what they need. And sometimes it's a challenge to get a 12-and-1/2-year-old to express what his needs are. DYLAN (OFFSCREEN): The unforeseeable conflict between having dyslexia and going to high school was lockers. The combination between memorizing numbers and then memorizing directional movement, it was just all bad. So I remember coming freshman year and being so freaked out that I couldn't open these lockers. I had to get my friends to open it. And then I'd put my stuff inside there and not be able to get my stuff out, and have to go get a teacher to unlock it for me. Finally, for the next four years, I just crammed everything in my backpack. But it kept me from embarrassing myself at the locker station. And still don't know how to use them. No idea. School is really hard. I feel like if I hadn't had parents who allowed me to pursue the arts, and allowed me to look at film, or allowed me to be in sports, that kind of thing, school would have just been absolutely miserable. I would have come home and felt worthless, and I would have had nothing to look forward to. But art is definitely where I've found my safety zone. Drawing has just been sort of thing that I have done when I don't understand something. It's always been sort of the default when my brain sort of detaches from-- I don't get what's going on. I better draw something. After a while, it just sort of became what I did most, is just figure out, OK, so how can I use what I like to do to tackle something that's hard for me? KYLE (OFFSCREEN): When Dylan started to go through the college application process and decided that he really wanted to go to Middlebury, frankly, I was really scared. How does someone prove on paper that they are an excellent problem-solver, out-of-the-box thinker, excellent leader? I knew that was going to be a challenge because of his poor test scores, his, for the most part, very strong grades. But then he would run into a teacher who didn't understand him and penalize him for poor spelling or something. I wondered if this process was going to confirm his worst fears about his academic future. DYLAN (OFFSCREEN): Basically what happened is I was wait-listed. My counselor got a call saying that, you know, we believe that, you know, Dylan's a very qualified student, and that, you know, he's done well enough. But we're afraid that he's had too much support and that he wouldn't be able to survive on his own. I'd been working so hard to get good grades and, like, getting to a place that would warrant me being able to go to college. Having someone think that I'd been, you know, overly supported and that I hadn't really owned the education that I worked so hard to create-- that's my worst nightmare, basically. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): My father, who I love dearly, never really understood why I got extra time. It was sort of his marker that I had some issue that separated me from the other kids. And, you know, why would he want his daughter to be lumped with the special kids and extra time? And I think that was kind of difficult. -My parents, I don't think, ever really picked up on it. And for many, many years, what I felt was I was basically putting one over on everybody, that it was only because I was willing to work extra hard. But it didn't really mean I was an A student. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): When I was in fifth grade, I had just come back from one of these evaluations, and I happened to pick up the phone when you're not supposed to pick up the phone. And the person who had diagnosed me was talking to both my parents and said, you know, Allison's never going to good with geography. She's never going to be good with language. These are things that she's just not going to be able to do. You know, I'll never forget. I hung up the phone and immediately got into bed, and I'm not-- I'm pretty sure I, as a fourth-grader or fifth-grader would do, cried myself to sleep. BONNIE (OFFSCREEN): I didn't study with other people, ever. Because other people read faster than I do. Other people will go at a pace that I can't keep up with. I never wanted anybody to think there was any issue. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): It was actually, in some ways, really frustrating because they didn't-- they weren't diagnosing me as dyslexic. They were saying you have a learning issue or a processing issue or whatever. So it wasn't even like, OK, this is my problem. How can I fix it? You think that's there's something wrong with you, or you think that maybe you're making it up in your head. So it was-- OK, you don't have an issue. You don't need to study harder. BONNIE (OFFSCREEN): I thought I didn't deserve those A's, that it was all just one colossal great acting job on my part, that it got me this far in life. But the reality was I really did have a disability. -I wasn't diagnosed as dyslexic until I was 23. The person who diagnosed me basically sat me down and said, you're really smart, but this is how you process information and this is why certain things are difficult for you. And it was just nice to hear someone say that no, this is what's wrong with you. This is a way to go about working with it, and this is what you can do. KAREN (OFFSCREEN): I like the one of the three of you on the roof. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): Look how little she is. KAREN (OFFSCREEN): Julia? ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. KAREN (OFFSCREEN): 'Cause I was going to-- I think the word dyslexia was comforting because it allowed her to understand her strengths and weaknesses. But honestly, I also think that it really could show her concretely, here's your intelligence level. You scored very high on your-- and nobody has ever really said that to her. They kept focusing on what were the deficits. She proceeded through school, and each year, she did get better and better in school. BONNIE (OFFSCREEN): Interestingly, college was actually a lot easier than high school. Because with college, you usually only have one exam, and it's at the end. So I had that time to catch up. I had that time to become the expert that I didn't always get in high school. It's like the tortoise and the hare, right? Why the tortoise would ever think to race the hare-- it seems crazy, right? But the tortoise wins. After four years at Penn, I went straight to Boston University for law school. Luckily, when a client interviews you, they don't ask what your reading rate is. They don't ask what you got on the LSATs. They want to know how successful you are, how good you are at what you do. And that's a story I, after, you know, years of being an attorney, could tell positively. Oh, hi. Yes. -I'll just share one story with you that I thought was so interesting. There was a little boy who's dyslexic, and he was crossing the street with his dad, and he saw lots of people jaywalking. And he looked up at his dad and said, well, you know, those Presbyterians ought to be more careful. And of course, he meant pedestrians. He knew what he meant, but the wrong word came out. -Aaahhhh. DR. SALLY SHAYWITZ (OFFSCREEN): The foundation of reading is speaking. And spoken language is made of different sounds. People who are dyslexic, these sounds are not as clear and as crisp. So for example, if I want to say the word "mat," I go into my internal dictionary and I pull out each sound, Mm, Ah, and Tuh, put them together, and I say the word. I don't even know I'm doing this. It's quick. It's automatic. People who are dyslexic-- and a lot of people don't appreciate it-- often have trouble pulling out the right sounds. Where they may stumble or speak around the word, or just not be glib. And unfortunately, we often judge people by how glib they are. -She's ready to wheel? Is Dr. [inaudible] ready to wheel? I try to speak slowly, because sometimes for me to get a word out is difficult. And I make a lot of malapropisms. I'll try to keep that to a minimum for this video. In high school, I remember a social studies teacher asking me what I wanted to do. And when I told him that I want to become a doctor, he kind of laughed at it. He thought, well, it would be lucky if I got into a college, let alone possibly get on to medical school. In medical school, I realized that I was definitely studying different than the other students. The other students would be able to read through the material either the day before the lecture, or they would read it that night after. And for me, specifically in anatomy, I would have to read the material once beforehand, then listen to the lecture, then read it again. On, my pick-up again. But what really hit it home was looking at the pictures in the anatomy text, or just going to the body, the cadaver, and really seeing it on the cadaver. And then I could picture it, and I was able to see the relationship between a nerve, an artery, a vein, a muscle. And by picturing it, it really stuck. I discovered that I had dyslexia when I picked up a book written by Sally Shaywitz and wanted to know all about dyslexia because my daughter was diagnosed with it. And that's when I realized-- you have one of those, like, moments, an epiphany, where this is what I've struggled with my whole life. Geralyn, my wife, was well aware of what dyslexia was. And she would always described someone as having a learning disability. And I was adamant with her that I had a learning ability. Because despite not reading well, I was able to get into medical school. And I ended up being elected to the honor society for medical schools. Today, I'm an orthopedic surgeon. NARRATOR (OFFSCREEN): While not all his dreams were embraced, he was driven by a higher calling. This is Richard Branson, and he's here to service you. Every last one of you. -That's one of the most amusing things that took place, was in my 50th year, I had now created 300 companies. We had the largest group of public, private companies in Europe. And one of my directors took me on one side at the end of a board meeting and said, look, Richard, erm, I have a feeling that you don't know the difference between net and gross. Please forgive me if I'm being impolite. And I admitted, hands up, that I didn't know the difference between net and gross. So he quietly takes me out of the boardroom, and he puts a bit of paper down on-- on the table, and he pencils in the sea. And then he pencils in a net coming out of the sea, and he put some fish in the net, and says, OK, so that's the profit at the end of a year, and there's the fish that are in the net. And this is your gross turnover, the first that are in the rest of the sea. Wow, I got it. I'd now got it. So I didn't have to say, is that good news or bad news anymore when people were giving me the figures for that company. -I've been very fortunate in having an opportunity to try a lot of very interesting lawsuits. United States Supreme Court, "Bush v. Gore" during the 2000 election. The California law that prohibited gay and lesbian citizens from marrying. Successfully defended CBS in the case brought by General William Westmoreland. I can remember one time, I was representing the Department of Justice, suing Microsoft for anti-trust violations. I kept referring to "lo-jin," as opposed to "log in," because you saw the L-O-G-I-N, and "lo-jin" seemed perfectly logical to me. And it took a couple of days before people sort of got the courage to tell me that I was totally mispronouncing kind of a key concept. -My handwriting is comical. I mean, doctors write brilliantly, with clarity. I have long said that. You do not want to see it. I mean, it's-- still to this day, I'm always embarrassed to write a note to people. That's kind of only my friends, and I get it typed up by-- thank god I have people helping me. -When I was about 15, I decided I'd had enough of school and tried to put the world right. I went to see my headmaster. I told him I was going to leave school. And he then said, you're either going to go to prison our you're going to become a billionaire. -I always thought artists had a different way of solving things. And I thought that was a pretty cool thing to do. So it inspired me to see, man, if they can solve an issue that way, why can't I solve some issues in the business world in a different way? -I mean, these financial services companies are still talking about retirement like it's some kind of dream. A vineyard? Gimme a break. ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): Talk to Chuck. CHARLES SCHWAB (OFFSCREEN): I just sort of said, no fuss, no muss. Integrate all these things together. -The good thing about being a dyslexic, if you're a business person, is that you simplify everything. If we launch a new financial service company, we won't use phrases like, you know, "bid-offer spread," because I have no idea what the hell it means. You know, we say what we mean, which is important, and I think that means that the public trusts us more as a result. -One of the things that I learned growing up was to listen well and to talk without notes. Because I couldn't read the notes. And it wasn't because I thought this was a good idea. It was because I didn't have any choice. But as you older, what you find is the ability to listen and to talk extemporaneously. It can be very valuable. -One of the things you'll learn, being dyslexic, is you've got to learn to suck it up, because you're going to fail, and you're going to fail often. And you've got to start to appreciate that, as they say, that failure is a portal of discovery. Mistakes are a portal of discovery. The most successful people I know are the ones that screwed up the most, learned from their mistakes, and moved forward and got up. -I think that dyslexia is positively correlated with creativity. -When people are working hard on a particular thing, and they're thinking about three or four different ways to get to the solution, I invariably say, you know, I think I got it. This is where we want to be. And other people are more sequential in their thinking. I intuitively sort of get there, generally speaking, much more quickly. And the ability to see the entire picture and step back from it, and not just learn, but think, I think the dyslexia teaches that, in a sense. Because learning is hard, it forces you to align more on thinking. And as you get out into the world, it's thinking that is a lot more prized than learning. DYLAN (OFFSCREEN): Finally, you know, I got a phone call in the middle of class saying, you know, you've been taken off the waiting list. I don't know. Of course I'm a little bit nervous about it. And especially, I feel like also with Middlebury, too, I mean, I'm probably the only kid that got, you know, the lowest-- I'm probably the lowest SAT-taker within the entire population of Middlebury. And-- and I think this means-- I had this feeling of sort of taking a risk on me as a student. Like, I have a feeling that the teacher's like, well, he has dyslexia, you know. So maybe, maybe this is true, but let's just see how he does. And then if he does well, then this means that kids with dyslexia can do well in this sort of intense academic environment. So I almost feel, like, an obligation that I have to do well so that other kids with dyslexia can feel comfortable in this environment. Scary, but I'm excited for it. DR. SALLY SHAYWITZ (OFFSCREEN): Knowing what we now know about dyslexia, you can be the smartest person in the world. You can even be a Nobel Prize-winner. You can be very motivated and try so hard, but you still won't read quickly. So what you do about that? You give the person what's called an accommodation. That is not giving you answers. You just allow them a little more extra time to read. -My main problem in taking tests is that I read the problem wrong. It's usually exhausting, going into your mind when you're trying to find a word. The problem's probably not going to be right. Mix up these words. For the rest of the test. How long is going to take? [interposing voices] Time. Time. Time. [boom] -People who are dyslexic would prefer not to need extra time. They don't like to read. And they would rather not sit for an extra hour or an extra 15 minutes or whatever it is. Dyslexia robs a person of time. Having accommodations returns it. We've learned that if you're not dyslexic and you have extra time, you might get a few extra points. Or because you have more time you need, you might go down, because you'll change a good answer to a bad answer. So the only people who actually go up substantially are people who are dyslexic. -Think of any suit. SHEREE (OFFSCREEN): I think the one thing that really annoys me is when people say, he's so smart. He's doing better than other kids. You know, like challenging the idea that he's dyslexic. If he's doing a B+ but he can do an A+, then he should be supported so that he can do the A+, because that's within his capacity. People struggle with that notion, because they think he's getting a leg up, whereas it's actually evening the playing field. DAVID BOIES (OFFSCREEN): Life is not a timed test. What matters is how well you do the job. And very rarely does it really matter whether you do it in 55 minutes or 75 minutes. People who don't understand dyslexia say things like, well, extra time on tests is going to give an unfair advantage. Those are people who have such a narrow view of testing that they think that what you really are trying to find out is how many things have people memorized, and how fast can they read? Those are just proxies. What you really want to know is how successful is this person going to be in really thinking and developing and creating things? Those are the kinds of things that are really important. And so when people talk about fighting extra time for people with dyslexia, they just don't understand what the process of life is. -Um, let me do the end. And see, it's not just swimming. It's water polo, field hockey, you know, you name it. I think along the way, when things were difficult for her, she's a very talented athlete. She'd often say to me, well, I may not have done well on that test, but nobody in my class can swim 50 breaststroke as quickly as I can. And that's gave her some confidence in other areas, and discipline. And I saw that discipline transfer to her work habits in school that took time to develop. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): No one ever gave me a packet on what to do or the best way to learn, or if you're not learning this way, you should go back and do it another way. But one of the things that I've learned in particular is that I need flashcards. I'm not one of those people who can just breeze through things and memorize a sheet. So I made tons and tons of flashcards for everything. Boxes of flashcards. I might look really silly. People may laugh at me. But end of the day, I'm going to do well on the test because I have, you know, 500 flashcards sitting on my desk. -I realized the only way I can read is if I underline or highlight. And then I'll take what I've read after I've highlighted or underlined and I'll basically do my own "Cliff Note" versions. I have all these binders in my house of books I've read over the years, my own "Cliff Note" versions. -I had a lot of my books on tape, because it allowed me to understand the story and what the author was trying to say without being caught up between the wordplay. -I would always take notes, and then I would take notes of my notes. And I just kept boiling it down until I knew it by heart. -If you're having a meeting, and sort of eight or ten ideas come out of that meeting, if you don't write it down, you're only going to remember one or two. And the rest will go disappear on the wind. So I will write lists of everything that's been said. That has been invaluable in building the Virgin empire. -Today, when I read, I almost go through in my mind, as I'm reading the word, almost spelling it out to myself as if I were to type on the computer. And I sometimes even tap it out with my feet as if I'm playing a keyboard with my toes. -There you go. -Thank you. Have a nice day. TYLER (OFFSCREEN): Finally, my wife and I both thought that the best thing for our daughter would be to take her out of her school. And we got her enrolled into a school which specializes for kids with dyslexia. GERALYN (OFFSCREEN): While it was very difficult to put her in a special school, I think ultimately, it was the biggest gift. Skye always says that Windward taught her how to crack the code. And the way she talks about her dyslexia is Mommy, I cracked the code. TYLER (OFFSCREEN): She shined in that school. And within a few months of being there, she had that curiosity again and that desire to learn. -I look at where Skye is now in her mainstream school, which is so rigorous, and I think that being in that real situation gave her such a jumpstart. She's really stepped up to the academic challenge. SKYE (OFFSCREEN): When I was, like, eight, I would always do, like, li-brar-y to help me spell. -I do that sometimes. -Overall, sixth grade has been a little different. When someone called me mentally retarded because I can't read or because I have dyslexia. And you know, I didn't really find it offensive. I just found it actually funny that someone would even say that as a comeback. You know, maybe if I was younger, like if I was six again, I would have, like, gotten really upset. But now I just find it funny that people would even try and, like, make a joke out of it. COACH (OFFSCREEN): Five six, seven, eight. Karate chop, one, and two. SKYE (OFFSCREEN): I love dance so much. Especially I love competition, because when I'm on the stage, I think about all the drama I've had this year. You know, some of my classes, I haven't been doing well in. And I just dance all my feelings out. [playing notes on piano] TYLER (OFFSCREEN): It brings me incredible joy just to see her perform and not hide herself the way I hid myself when I was her age. -And why was her accomplishment so important? Skye? -Um, well, Jessica Watson, she sailed. -Skye will be able to do what she has her heart set on. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): And that kind of kept me going, even though, you know, it might have taken me longer to read a book or read a poem, I just really loved learning and reading. I've really tried to become good at things that someone once said that I couldn't do. KAREN (OFFSCREEN): I told the person who had done Allison's testing in fifth grade-- she lives in our town, and I ran into her and said, guess where Allison is? Oh, she just graduated University of Chicago, double major in history and philosophy. I think the woman, like, you know, practically fell over. They were saying she can't do music. She shouldn't take a foreign language. It made it sound like her life would be limited in some way. And what I've been so overjoyed and sort of letting the breath out is to see she got into her first-choice college. She gets the job she wanted. She just takes a little longer. And whether it's working on her-- as a reporter and putting in the extra hours, and not meeting the people at the bar to get the good story or write her thesis, she's willing to do that. ALLISON (OFFSCREEN): I finished my thesis. In the comments that I got back, one of my professors laid out everything. You set the bar at trying to explain this really complicated historical process. It's a very original idea. And bravo, you accomplished it. After I finished, it was just this moment of, like, wow, I just wrote a 74-page document, and, like, I'm still ready to go. You know, like, what's next? DYLAN (OFFSCREEN): I had no idea if I was going to be able to do it or not. But once I got to Middlebury, it was actually really interesting. They have this counselor who's part of the CTLR, this, like, center for something having to do with, like, learning, and-- I don't know what the abbreviation's actually for. But I went and talked to this woman there, and she said something really interesting thing. She's like, well, Middlebury accepted over, like, you know, like 30 or 40 kids with learning disabilities this year in the class, so you're definitely not alone in dealing with this situation. And it was really great, because I realize that they have kids with dyslexia. They know exactly how to deal with it. They only allowed me one semester's worth of accommodations because by government things or something like that, I have to have an updated evaluation. You know, it has to be done. -Have you been to the center before? -No. I've never even been to New Haven. So this is-- this is all a new experience. -This is it. DYLAN (OFFSCREEN): The purpose of all this retesting, I'm kind of confused about. Because they asked that I come and get retested here. But I'm-- from where I'm concerned, it's not something that just sort goes away. DR. SALLY SHAYWITZ (OFFSCREEN): You are correct. There is no reason. If we're dealing in in a world of science and reason, there's absolutely no reason to be retested. And if we've learned one thing, it's that dyslexia doesn't go away. There's always going to be challenges. -Yeah. -But what-- what I would hope would happen with society is the artificial barriers would fall. The slow reading will always be there. I don't think you're ever going to be a great speller. -Nope. -And I don't know what you're handwriting's like, but I don't think-- -Not great. -I don't think-- but so what? Dyslexia is basically a paradox. I like to describe it as an island of a weakness in getting to the sounds of words, but surrounded by a sea of strength in critical thinking, in problem-solving, in reasoning-- the kind of things you can't teach, but it's really good if you have them. And people who are dyslexic really have them. -Every achievement that I make, it's like, OK, well, I was able to do that. Let's see if I can just go for this, too. I was really prepared for him to struggle when he hit his college environment. And the first semester, I was really relieved to hear that he was not only surviving, but thriving. But it was when he called me to tell me that he had made honors in his first year of college, I literally had to sit down on a bench, and I started to cry. And then I was really scared that he was going to be able to tell that it had moved me. Because I wanted him to know that I had faith in him beyond these external measures. He said to me, I know, Mom, I'm on a list. And I paused, and he said, you know, it's good to be on a list, especially for all those people who believed in me and who took a chance on me, and now I'm on a list. I maybe had ditched the academic super-stardom plans for him, but he hasn't ditched them for himself. KAREN (OFFSCREEN): In our family, we kind of laugh and say, oh, we care about the effort. We don't care about the grade. Because I know that this is an arc. School is an arc. And life is a long time, and how you're performing in Mrs. Livowitz's fourth grade is actually a really small piece of your life. And I think it's important for parents to keep their eye on the big picture. DAVID BOIES (OFFSCREEN): One of the ironies of dyslexia is the further along you get, the easier it becomes. It's the willingness to continue, the patience to continue, the perseverance, that is critical when you have dyslexia. -Even if you feel uncomfortable doing it, you have to push yourself to do whatever it takes. -The biggest mistake that someone could make is think that I'm-- the only way I can get through this is pretend like I don't have dyslexia, and just have to work so hard to become normal. That's just impossible, because, like, your brain is different. But it doesn't mean that you can't still do the things that you want to do. It's so important to just own it. Just totally own it. DR. SALLY SHAYWITZ (OFFSCREEN): So that means there are 10 million in the US who are dyslexic. Every class has children who are struggling readers. And if we can get all the people who care about dyslexia to come forward and joint the community of people who care and want to change society's perceptions, we could actually make promise. DR. TOBY "DELOS" COSGROVE (OFFSCREEN): I think the only reason I got into medical school was because I had an interview. The fact that they've, at a very early age, have gone over a lot of hurdles, and they've overcome them. And so for admissions people, you've already realized that you have got kids who are persistent. And that persistence will take you through a tremendous number of things. CHARLES SCHWAB (OFFSCREEN): One in five kids are born with it. Comes through their DNA. Most don't get attention. Most go through life never knowing, never achieving their potential. SKYE (OFFSCREEN): I know I will do something that makes a difference in this world, whether it's finding a way to clean the water in Africa or discovering a new cure to cancer-- who knows? I can do anything. [music playing] -I'm Chuck Schwab.
