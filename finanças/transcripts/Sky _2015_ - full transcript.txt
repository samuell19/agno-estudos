"On the day of your brother's birth, I looked out through "the hole in my teepee and I saw a coyote running "and that is why he is named Running Coyote.

I have to be far away by tomorrow noon as well. - So we agree. - We agree. - Hello! - Good day, ma'am Can I help you? - I'd like to speak to a detective, please. I killed my husband. I hit him on the head with a lamp in a hotel and then I left him. I bought a car for his $1000. I think it's a Plymouth and I drove for -- - What's your name, ma'am? - Romy Kellinger. - Can I see some ID? Thank you. You're on vacation with your husband here in the US? - Yes. - Okay, you hang tight. I'll be right back. We're just gonna verify your ID. In the meantime, would you like to have a lawyer present? - No. Do I have to? - Well, no. It's not required. But I do wanna run you through a couple of the steps about what's gonna happen next. So before I'm gonna open up your case into the facts of which you have accused yourself, I'm gonna ask you a series of questions. We can verify the details of those questions and all this turns out to be true then yes, at that point you are gonna need a lawyer. Do you understand? - I understand. Thank you. - Alright, then. You okay, miss, you ready to start? - Yes. I'm good. Thank you. You're very kind. - Okay, so why don't you tell me where this happened? - At a motel, in 29 Palms. I -- I think it's called the 29. - And when was this? - 3 days ago. It was during the night, around 2 o'clock in the morning. So I guess that's technically the 29th. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to mix up the dates, I -- - Ma'am, ma'am. It's okay, relax. The questions are gonna be precise 'cause I need to verify all of these details. What's your husband's name? - Richard Moreau. - That's French, yeah? - Yes. - So then you're the one of German descent? - Yes, by my mother's side. - She raised us. My father was French but.. Yeah, my brother and I kept-- - Ma'am, that's enough for right now. I'm gonna step out again try and verify all of this it shouldn't take me more than a couple of minutes. Hang tight, I won't be too long. - Okay, so. It's like I guessed. You didn't strike me as a killer when you walked in here. I have some good news. Your husband is alive. And he told me the story. The two of you had a bit of a domestic dispute it sounds like, it got heated he slipped, he hit his head nothing but an accident. I'm gonna give this back to you right now. I think this is something you need to talk to your husband about not the police. I'm just gonna take that.. ...and we can pretend like you were never here. How's that sound? He's in the hospital in 29 Palms. I'm so ashamed. I'm so ashamed, Romy. Where were you? What did you do? I drove for miles. I was so scared. I drove for miles. - What matters is that you're here. - No. What matters is that you're alive. There was so much I wanted to tell you but... We'll go back to Paris and... We'll talk. No. I'm not going back. I'm staying. How? With what money? I bought a car with your money. An old... brown Plymouth. It's yours. Goodbye. - Where you going? - Las Vegas. - Las Vegas.

That the clients will come for that. I think that's a really good idea, no? My mother taught me how to make a really good apple tart. It's the only thing she taught me. - What's this about gettin' a job? I thought you were just passin' through. - I am just passing through. - Your brother's here. Oh, my God, you got all dressed up! - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - What's that? - I made you a pie. - You made it? - Yes. - How's it goin', man?

She goes down to the grocery store she checks out the date on the food they throwing away and she comes back with a fuckin' trunk load of garbage. Its fuckin' cans of beef. It's fuckin' garbage. - Well, we make savings. - Oh, yeah, what good are savings 6 feet under with some like dumb-fuck bacteria, huh? - Come on. - Austin? Come here. We gotta take a bath. We gotta take a bath. - Can you take her for one second? Thank you. I just gotta get these tarts out. We're not really having anything too fancy 'cause you can't really do that with kids, but.. ...you've got so much patience for that. God! I can barely handle it, you know. It's just like one...kid after the other. I don't know what to say. I just get pregnant so easy. Kayla, are you being good? Is she being good? - Oh, they're very sweet. - She is very sweet.

What are we gonna have now a French sister-in-law 'cause that'd be funny. That'd be a funny thing. - You gotta clean that dumb-shit out of your conversation, Billie 'cause it sure is buggin' us around here. - Okay, Joe. Then you make conversation if you're so good at it. Well, look what happens when I don't talk. Nobody talks. - Why does Diego cough like that? - I don't know. I mean, I think he's been doing it ever since he came back from the war. I mean, that's what Joe told me. He said that, it left him real broke up I mean, I've only know him 5 years since I've been with Joe but it's been like that the whole time. So it's gettin' real serious with you two? - I don't know. - Hey, Billie, quit telling your last story and come out here and show me your cheerleader routine. - Oh, my God! - You make a really pretty cheerleader. - I haven't done it in ages.

My body rejects them. - I've had four. - DNC or spontaneous miscarriage? - DNC once. - And the three other times it just happened. - You're not bleeding? - No. - Well, your pregnancy's off to a good start. So don't go on fearing another disaster. That'd be a shame. Make sure the father to be pampers you. - Then you'll be fine. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. - Saw Diego's truck last night, here? - He's in the bathroom. He's not doing too good. - Are you okay? Come on. - My body's sick, Romy. It was poison. - I'm broken like you said I was. I could light up a whole town with the.. ...amount of ray in my gut. This is the payoff from.. ...depleted uranium is.. ..when it hits a target and you.. ...you breathe it in.. ...right here. It gets in your blood and your lungs. You fell for a guy that's gonna die. - I can't even make love to you anymore. - Do you remember when we made love for the first time in Vegas? Afterwards I went walking outside in the sunshine and.. ...I saw my shadow. And next to my big shadow there was...a small shadow. Like a child. And I was holding hands with the child. And Missy, she told her grandmother. And she said it means that I will have a child. And it's true. I went to the doctor and it's true. Are you okay? - You gotta get rid of it, rabbit. - I'm not afraid to have this child. - Actually, yeah. Let's keep it. It might be nice.. ...have a little baby with a eyeball in the middle of his forehead. Or maybe a baby born with no arms. Maybe he'll be born with leukemia. A nice little cancer his dad gave him. Someone he's never ever gonna meet. - Stop it! - No, you stop it! You wouldn't even hold this baby in your arms. That's how much you like it! You'd think it was ugly. You'd feel so bad about yourself for being such a selfish bitch that you -- - Stop it! - You piss me off with your little fucking angel eyes you know that? Get rid of it. - I don't know what to do. - You can't change what happened. It's all meant to be. But you've been given a beautiful, beautiful life to take on. So don't, don't cry. I will be here for you. We'll go through this together. It's gonna be okay. That's why we gave you the name of Sky Mapiya. You're always changing. The sky is always changing. - Thank you. - You probably won't like this. It's cactus. - I like cactus. - Hmm-mm, I don't know if you'll like this one actually. - It's good. - Hm.. - Hmm, no. - May I take your order? - Yes. Uh, Polish sausage, please. - Thank you. That'll be right out. - The white man desires for material possessions and power has blinded him. - Those guys are such a drag. It's a letter to President Nixon from 1970. - Nah, you're tough. I signed the letter before I knew you. - Yeah, well, that doesn't surprise me. - Thanks. Nice. - Oh, come on. Not you. You're different. - Oh, yeah. Very, very different. - Hi. - Jesse sent me. I know you're gonna be sad.. - Shh. Shh. - I love you. Tell him he was always wanted for me. Alright? You tell him that. - Diego. Diego. I love you! I love you! Let's run. Whoo.
