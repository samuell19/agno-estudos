Too bad about Shadow King. That outfit seems to become you. Think so? It really does. You smell like a horse. Take a break after this? Let's have lunch. I don't have money. Don't worry. It's on me. Go ahead. Go. I'll finish up. See you later. You and boss don't look much alike. Think so? And you don't look like you grew up in Obihiro. Came here in 4th grade. Before that, Sarabetsu. The town on the way to Hiroo? Dad used to farm there. What does your father do? He's long dead. He was drunk from morning and shouted at us all day. I was little. I don't remember much. I heard your father was a great jockey. A trainer or something now? What's the matter? He disappeared. When we were rich many gathered for the money. His life-style became extravagant, and he was deep in debt. And he disappeared. There's a place I want to go to. Can you join me? This way. This is terrific. After the dam, it's no longer in use. Steam locomotives used to run here. Really? Dad brought me here several times. The village where he was born is under this lake now. I sometimes come here. I don't know why, but I come here. A wonderful place. Several years ago, I came here in fall. The bridge was gone. This bridge? The dam water level had risen. It was under the lake. A bridge that disappears. Manabu. Don't go out with Makie anymore. Why? Makie is Mikko's daughter. Mikko's my mentor. If anything happens, I can't face Mikko. We only went for a drive. Why are you saying this? It's because you're my employee. Then, I quit. Be a slave for that salary? Slave? Working for others? You don't know how I feel. No, I don't. I did all I could, too. Dumping me and mom? That's right. That's how desperate I was. To take revenge on the world. Why must you take revenge? To end up like this? You're pathetic. Such a fool. Manabu. Manabu. What is it? What d'you think Unryu's doing now? Isn't he eating? No, he isn't eating anything. That's a signal horses send to people they like. Move their mouths like that. Just as I thought. Unryu does like you, Manabu. You're the first one Unryu befriended so quickly. They like it, when you caress them carefully. Unryu's saying he likes it. So, you like this. Why do it so seriously? He'll soon be sashimi? Don't say that. He's angry. Look at him. Hey, what are you thinking? Why train a horse without a future? Concerning Unryu just exercise him enough so he won't get sick. I pity the horse going along with your fickle moods. You've been spoiled, since you were a small child. It's because mom had you when she was much older. You received all her affection. Is mom well? Yes. Just exercise you enough so you won't get sick. My brother's terrible. Unryu, don't you think so, too? Unryu. Stop. Unryu. - Are you all right? Hey. Screamed when he fell. Look. It's all red. Never saw anyone fall so hard. Unryu has gotten bigger. Eats well. Manabu might have the talents to work at a stable. I see him talking with Unryu. He's great. Manabu, what do you talk about? He listens to my gripes. Then, you are a genuine stable hand. Gripes, huh? Motsu, I gripe, too. We know about you. Gripes, huh? Attaboy. Unryu. Maybe Monday Morning Disease. He won't be able to race? Not in this condition. Better cancel him. Darn. I was sure he'd win. It can't be helped. I'll call his owner. Attaboy, Unryu. That's good. Very good. This one's okay. Nothing to worry about. The stool's fine. He's well taken care of. Boss, he looks better than the time he was racing. You're a champion stable hand. Not me. Manabu takes care of Unryu. Manabu? Boss's younger brother. Boss's? I see. Boss, let's take Manabu with us. Forget it. There's no time. Hey, send it. Keep sending it. Please go get him. Working? Of course. For you. Manabu. Et's try from Clap our hands. Clap, clap. Are you ready? Clap our hands. Clap, clap. It's your mother. If you're happy, clap your hands. Let's all clap our hands Haruko. Mrs. Yazaki, been well? You have a visitor. I'm sorry, mom. I couldn't... I wanted to come, but I was busy, and... I'm so sorry. No need to apologize. Is your mother in here, too? What are you saying? Mom, it's me, Manabu. Haruko, what is he talking about? This person is Manabu. Is he from the mainland? He must be. Unlike Takeo, he looks refined. Mister, do you know Toto University? The national university. My son graduated from that university. Now he runs his own company. When he succeeds, he's supposed to come for me. A president must be a busy job. I'm sure he'll come soon. Are you ready? We'll walk forward. If you're happy, clap your hands? Clap, clap? Now backwards. Now, in pairs. If you're happy, let's show it Let's all clap hands This time feet? If you're happy, stamp your feet Got to pee. Her senility began 3 years ago. It gradually became worse. Couldn't leave her alone and had to take her there. Looking at horses makes you feel very gentle. It does. Manabu, horses are great animals. Here. Thank you. There's a vacancy for the last race here. I've decided to enter Unryu. Competition's tough, but it's better for him than retiring. I've asked Makie to be the jockey. Tomi. - Yes? Help Makie with the training. Should begin your jockey training. Jockey's a tough job. Yes, sir. Must be happy, Tomi. You'll be with Makie. It's great. Right? Shut up. Manabu. Tetsuo. Take care of Unryu. Tomi, great chance. I know that. Mom seems to like Haruko a lot. While I'm away from Obihiro I ask her to take care of mom. She thinks of her as family because she's always with her. Talked to Haruko like a daughter-in-law. Maybe she wants you to marry Haruko. You ask Haruko to care for mom, cause you want to marry her, right? I think Haruko wants to marry you, too. You've got no right to meddle with my life. Your wife left you, didn't she? You're right. You're absolutely right. Makie. Yes? Only want 1 st place for Unryu. After the gate, go for it. He'll collapse. Can't get ahead doing what others do. Until the 2nd hump, be the leader. Save his strength there. I know. No need to tell me. Don't save it half way. Other horses will pass Unryu and begin ascending the 2nd hump, but don't move. Unryu will struggle to go forward but be patient. Pull the reins with all your weight. Save it. Save it. Then, loosen the reins. When is that? The moment the leading horse passes the top of the 2nd hump. Climb straight up. The rest is easy. Unryu's fast on flat ground. If he can't climb straight up? C'mon. Pull the reins. Makie. That's right. Lower your hips. The horse's lagging. What the hell are you doing? Straighten up. You're Mikko's daughter. I'm not him. I must win the next race. If you want to win so bad, get another jockey. Hey. Makie. Was given handicaps. 10 kilos for woman and 10 for newcomer. But after 50 wins, I was no longer a newcomer. With half the handicap, I couldn't win. This year I've had no offers to ride. Then, work hard from now on. Right, Manabu? Yes. That's not the solution. Why? Not geared to it. Can't understand how horses feel. Don't say such a thing. Hey. Welcome. - Are you okay? Madam. Welcome. Haruko. Welcome. Where did you get such pretty flowers? The bar belongs to that old fart. He has women running several others. He helped out Haruko with her money problems long ago. He's filthy rich. How rich? He's a loan shark and owns apartment buildings and bars. Hey... ls that you, fella? We met... Hello. My, my. You knew each other. Thank you very much. You completely fooled me. You're Mikko's daughter. I thought you'd be a better jockey. I was absolutely wrong. You said she rides like Mikko. Yes, but if she can't win? Races aren't only about winning. Races aren't only about winning, huh? If you don't win you can't make any money. Money's important. How much do you want? Goes with my line of business. You're deep in debt, aren't you? Lend you as much as you want. I'm not lying. Haruko will be my witness. Lost a lot because of you. You're mentally too weak. You quickly give up, thinking it's easier. I get it now. Mikko got deep into debt so decided to disappear. Such a small man. You're just like your dad. Mr. Tanba, please. You're sashimi? Too. Fella. Fella. Wait. He's such an asshole. Let him talk. He's a useless drunk. That old fart is right. That's why I'm angry. You just graduated rookie. Work on it and you'll win. You casually came to the tracks. What would you know? You jerk. Get up. What is it? Makie's gone. You were with her. Last time she ran I apologized and they consented. But that won't work this time. Did you come back alone? Why don't you keep her on a short leash? You hurt her. Don't blame me. You useless punk. Resorting to violence? Don't you want Unryu to win? I do. I want to see him race. Boss. Boss. Her phone won't respond. Maybe switched off. Her car's here. Hasn't gone far. Tomi. - Boss. Where else can you think of? I didn't come here thinking it would be a vacation. Things went wrong with my company. I lost my wife, money and connections. When I came to myself, I was here. I bet whatever money I had left on Unryu. Even if Unryu won steak and wine was all I could afford. That was about it. But I became penniless. Now that Unryu can race again I want to bet on him once more. Can't place any money, but want to bet on him. Don't know how to say it, but I want to run along with him. I can tell Unryu wants to be in the race. Please. Be Unryu's jockey once more. All right. You want me to win, right? - Thanks. Hold. Hold. Go. The oak tree stretches its roots on the earth Sarabetsu where lilies-of-the-valley bloom Let us study and converse The spring of academics flows Be the ones to support the future Tetsuo. Was there a river near your house? Yes, a tiny river. Did we catch crayfish there? The chicken... We fed crayfish to chicken. We had some chicken. Crayfish was chicken feed. Now I remember. Crayfish... See. I told you so. The oak tree stretches its roots on the earth Sarabetsu where lilies-of-the-valley bloom Let us study and converse The spring of academics flows Be the ones to support the future Sarabetsu Sarabetsu South Elementary School Go for it. If you win tomorrow you can live another year. Manabu. Move your family register here. I'll let you apply, so you can officially work at my stable. I'll go back to Tokyo. Go back and do what? I don't know what I should do. That's darn pitiful. I'll see Sudo, and apologize. Don't know what'll happen after that. But I must apologize to Sudo. I see. I truly envy you, big brother. Why is that? You have no hesitation. What are you saying? I'm always hesitating. Did you tell the others here you were leaving? Would you tell them later? They'll miss you. All of them. Good morning, everybody. This is the 3rd day of the 10th Draft-Horse Obihiro Races. From the 1 st to the 12th races... Unryu. Thanks a lot. Boss told me you're going back to Tokyo. Yes, I am. Thanks for everything. Haruko. Yes? I need a favor. What is it? Can you go to Asahikawa with Takeo? He wants you to. I'm not joking. He seriously... Forget it. Forget what? I... I have a son, a high school boy. So what if you have a child? When I got pregnant, my man ditched me. It wasn't easy bringing up my boy. I'm not proud of everything I've done. It's been a tough life. Here. That was long ago. But I've given up. If I wished becoming happy with a man I'd be punished. When it snows and winter comes he'll come to Obihiro. When draft-horses come to Obihiro I can be with boss until spring. That's good enough for me. Bow. Mount. Thank you. Weight 942 kilos. Plus 14 kilos. No. 5 is Unryu. Jockey, Makie Shuto. Weight, 1,036 kilos. Plus 10 kilos. Makie. Boss. Your old man killed himself, owing to his enormous debts. Heartless ones may say that. Mikko is not such a weakling. He must be alive somewhere. Believe so, don't you? That's why you became a jockey. Give everything you've got. Sale of betting tickets will end with the chime. Let's go. YAZAKI STABLE This race is with a full-gate of 10 horses. Riding on the cold wind blowing from the goal the fanfare echoes through. Forward. Unryu. Unryu, go... That's it. They are approaching the mid-point between the humps. And No. 5 Unryu has taken a small lead. Others are catching up. The crucial moment. All 10 horses are at the 2nd hump. What happens now? No. 3 Energy made the first move. Hold. No. 9 Arrow Commander followed by No. 5 Unryu. All the horses are running desperately. Go. Unryu. Don't stop, Unryu. Go, Makie. Go. Go. Go. Attaboy. No. 5 Unryu. Unryu is the first one to descend the 2nd hump. Unryu is leading.
