Um, no, that's not usually a problem for me. Well, that's a nice one for you to have. So, when deciding to purchase a good, the main thing to consider… I'm sorry. Am I the only person that's hot in here. Uh, yeah, it is still a little hot, everybody else warm? Yeah. Alright, you know, let me just check on that real quick.

Well, we're talking about splurging on items outside your income. What are you trying to say?

I mean, it was just a couple of days ago. Someone has to do it, right? Sure. He's suing an ethics paper. What do you mean? That's due tomorrow. Yeah, that’s right. What? I’m sorry if I have a life. No, that’s not what I meant. I just, you know. We both know I’m going to end up copying hers anyway so. Alright. What should I do with this one? What’s in it? Uh perfume and stuff. See if you can find her black nail Polish. She never went anywhere without wearing it. Your grandma wore black nail Polish? Gangster. Not in this one. Yeah, she was pretty amazing. Should my grandma have friends over for dinner every night? Why? Thought you said your grandma was a terrible cook. Never said terrible. That’s right. It’s a vomit-inducing catastrophic. You sure you’re okay? Yeah. Um can you see what’s in that chest right over there? That one? Yeah. Oh, hello. Listen to this. The one that reads it through shall read it without an issue. If your intent is to renew your soul red is the path you shall go. Your blood, flesh and bones shall be fed with a piece of your own. Once you’ve started, there is no going back for your body will only be alive with that. Empty people for a powerful soul. That is the path you’ve now chosen to go. Grandma’s poetry sucks. The principle of morality, could be reached by a standard of rationality with our own minds figuring it out. He dubbed that a categorical imperative. It had to be it was imperative. Ladies, are we bothering you? Emily, since you seem to know all of this, would you enlighten us with the definition of morality please? Morality is the differentiation of intentions, actions, decisions between wrong and right. Okay, on to the next. Let’s talk about right and wrong. Who can give me a definition? That’s defined by your culture. Yes, in some cases, you’re exactly right. Uh ethics refers to rules defined by an external source. Whereas morality these are the internal rules. Ethically, it is wrong to kill someone. We all agree on that, right? But let’s say, let’s take it a step further. Let’s say your government puts you into war. You’ve got a gun. The other guy’s got a gun. What are you going to do? That is a moral dilemma when you come face to face. So, Next class, I’d like you to read chapters one through four and we’re going to talk about this more deeply and just for fun, bring in your own personal example of a moral dilemma. Okay? Thank you. Class dismissed. So what’s your big moral dilemma? I don’t know. What choice? What happened to like… oh are you are you okay? Yeah. I’m going to go to the bathroom. Can you watch my stuff? I’m sorry. We’re sorry. The number you have dialled is not in… Hello. I don’t get it. I really am sorry that happened to you but you can’t change it now. How is it possible that I did a ritual without even knowing it? You read the book and you put on the pendant. There’s gotta be another way. It can’t be that simple. I mean. There isn’t. The transition only happens after you have tasted. There’s no point in trying to hide it. We are the same now. You can trust me. What do I do now? You’re getting weaker by the day. You need to eat. I can’t. You can’t eat what you’re used to. You need flesh to survive and it has to be fresh. You’re insane. Why would anyone choose this life? I know this wasn’t your choice but as I said, you need to eat. Now, it’s kill or be killed. You want to go get something to eat? I’m not hungry. Come on, you can pick the place. I said no. Jesus, I’m just worried about you. Why are you attacking me? Trust me. I’m not. Yeah, but I don’t. Just leave me alone. Now, you’re turning into a real bitch lately. Not the Emily I used to know. Emily. Are you okay? I’m just... Do you want me to call the nurse? Are you alright? No. I’m I’m... I’m so sorry. Now arriving downtown… So you think I’ll like it there? Yeah. Yeah I think so. I mean, I hope so. Haven’t really taken many people here before. Who have you taken here? Just my ex. So, where is this place anyway? It’s a surprise. It’s getting kind of dark. Do you want to stop again? Sounds good. We are just going… no thanks. I just late. See you soon. How long have you guys had this place for? Well, my parents have lived all over the place but this is a vacation home. They’ve had it for a while. My sister and I haven’t visited them for years. Years? What happened? Do you guys get in a fight or something? No, no, of course not. We just all have our own lives, I guess. Billy wait up. For a bit. Hurry up. Billy. Billy, come here. Haven’t taken a dump have you yet? No look. What is that? Holy shit. We need to go. Sarah, how many this time? Detective Hayes, I think that you’re working the cases anymore. I am, fine. What we got? One child, male, approximately 7 months. Cause of death looks like strangulation. The body is in advance decay. I think it’s been here about four to five weeks. We found the body. Some local children. Anything is the body has the same markings as the other bodies that have been found. Alright, finish up here. Take the body to the coroner and get it analyzed. I’ll meet you there. John, good to see you back. Come in. Hi, John. Uh we’ve got a man who’s just come in. He’s reported his wife is missing and there’s no one else around. You do me a favor and take this one. Yeah, I’ll be there in a minute. Cheers. He’s in room two when you’re ready. Evening. I’m detective John Hayes cid. I’ve been assigned your case. So, you are David Hughes, is that correct? Yeah. Time is 11:26 pm on June the ninth two thousand and sixteen. So, from what I’ve been made aware, your wife and missus Anya Hughes went missing from your home in Redding last night, is that correct? Yes. Okay, I need you to tell me everything that happened starting from the beginning. I’ve just told the other police officer everything. I don’t understand. You haven’t told me, have you? Is there any reason you can think of why Arnie would want to leave? Any recent argument? No. I already told the other officer. When I woke up, she was already gone. There was no note, all of her stuff was still in the house. There was no reason for her to leave. Where did you get that bracelet? Oh, sister Claire gave them to me and my wife. Said it was like a symbol of starting a new life or something. Who’s sister Claire? Uh she’s a member of my wife’s congregation. Liam met about a year ago. Um they became pretty close. When’s the last time you were your wife’s sources declare? Yesterday, she was over the house before we went to bed. Why is she at your house? About a week ago, Annie was telling me she had been hearing things and s eeing things in the house that weren’t there. I just thought it was a bit of stress you know. We’d only moved into the house recently. And this time of year is it’s difficult for us about five years ago our daughter went missing Had a pretty big effect on both of us. Anyway, she called sister Claire and sister Claire came over to reassure her and to bless the house. What time did sister Claire arrive at your house? It must have been after 10, maybe 10:30. Yeah, about 10:30. I let her in, told her to make herself at home. And you was upstairs. She’d been in bed all day. So I went up stairs to tell her sister Claire had arrived. Obviously, it’s been a difficult time for Annie and well, I know she’d appreciate you being here. Sister Claire. Is everything alright? Yes, I was just admiring your beautiful mirror. It’s actually a family heirloom. I believe that originally belonged to my grandmother. And you’ve always loved it. After my my mom passed away last year. We brought it with us to the new house. At least you’ll find somewhere to put it up now. Well, it’s very beautiful. My grandmother had a bohemus of a mirror right in the center of her hallway. Really? Yeah, she was obsessed with it. She used to just stand there reticent. She used to look past her reflection as if she was waiting. Waiting for what? Claire. Thanks for coming. Honey, my dear, how are you feeling? I’ve been better, not going to lie. Look, I think we should now bless the house. It will put your mind at rest. I’d like that. And bless this house oh lord. Give it your protection for this couple who are starting a new chapter of their lives together here. May your love bring happiness and joy. Amen Thank you for that. I really appreciate you coming here and on such short notice. Of course, my dear. Well, my work here is done. I must go. It’s getting late. Sorry, before you leave. Can I just check there wasn’t something here? I’m sorry. I just feel more comfortable knowing I wasn’t crazy. Look. There is nothing to fear. The miracle that is inside you is his instrument for change. And the world will be blessed by it. When you witness it. Don’t worry my dear. Everything will reveal itself in time. Thank you dear. I almost forgot. I made these white bracelets for you. They represent a new life. A new start. Thank you, sister. Right, we best be letting you get on then. Alright. See you Sunday. See? Nothing to worry about. We got each other, yeah? Yeah. Like sister Claire said, this house is a fresh start for us. I’m going to head up, okay? Yeah. I’ll switch everything off. Is that the last time you saw your wife? Yes. Look, I don’t even understand how she could’ve left the house. The keys were on the hook, all of the doors and windows were locked. I checked the entire house. Do you recognize any of these people? Look, I just want to find my wife. Do you recognize any of these people? No. Take a closer look. Alright. Sister Claire. You sure? Yeah. You’re absolutely sure that’s her. It’s definitely her. That photo was given to us 2 years ago. She’s someone of high interest in a number of missing person’s cases. Wait. You’re telling me she isn’t even a real nun. If that wasn’t the woman at your house then no. Her and some others are involved in a series of copycat killings. There’s no way. It’s a mistake. The case has all the similar aspects to it. It’s a mistake. This case has all the similar aspects to it but there’s one thing that does not make sense. In all the other cases, it was a child that been missing. So, I’m trying to understand why your wife has vanished. She was pregnant. She was only six or seven weeks pregnant. Did sister Claire know? I’ll be right back, okay? Wait. What? Where’s my wife? The ogres. A fearsome and wicked entity that serves the darkest of evil feeding on the young and innocent with one single objective to become human only that from which is born pure can this entity enter the realm of man. One face. I am the darkness. The life you have will be mine. And I will cause suffering. When the darkness consumes. Gathers associates, this is ed, how may I help you? Ed. Lucy. Hi, when are you coming by to get the rest of your things? Are you really just calling me for that? Look, I need to know.

I wish there was something I could do. Don’t worry about it. Well, I guess some things are just not meant to be. You know, it’s funny. Have you been married to the love of your life for over four years? You start to think to yourself, everything’s alright. Everything’s perfect. That is until one day she walks up to you, looks you straight in the eyes and says, I don’t love you anymore. That’s when it clicks. She’s seeing someone. Do you have a place to stay?
