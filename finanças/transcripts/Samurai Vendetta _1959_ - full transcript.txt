I had to assist my uncle in his duel with the Murakami brothers... ...and while I was running towards Takata-no-baba... ...at the corner of the Ana- hachiman Shrine... This is an emergency! Please excuse me! I am much obliged. That's not a good tasuki! "Tasuki:" A cord used to tuck up kimono sleeves, and keep them out of the way. My tasuki? If you're not careful, that tasuki will... It's dangerous; if that tasuki becomes untied... "I hereby commit to writing, that on this day, at half-past the bottom hour of the snake... "Half-past the bottom hour of the snake:" ~11:30 AM "...at Takata-no-baba, the Itto-ryu and Chishin-ryu schools will duel... "...to determine which style is superior with respect to the principles of the sword." "This challenge is therefore issued for this express purpose." "It is my will as a warrior to..." Scum! He's in danger. If that tasuki unravels... Is something the matter? I warned that man about his tasuki, but it seems he did not understand me. I am going to go check on him. Meanwhile, continue on. Follow through. He's taking on the Murakami brothers. You there, Sir Ronin. Use this as your tasuki. Your Lordship. Your Lordship. What is it? Your Lordship. What is it? We cannot risk any mishaps during this important trip... ...so we turned back to watch out for you. You're right. You never know what kind of calamity might befall us. Those are the Murakami brothers; we're of the same Chishin-ryu school. Indeed they are. Indeed they are. It is as you say, old man, we might invite trouble by getting involved. Let's go. Let's go. Yes. Uncle. Uncle. A... Are you alright? Uncle. Uncle. A... Are you alright? Yasubei. I am Horibé Yahei of the Asano clan, from Ako in Banshu Province. It is an honor. I am Nakayama Yasubei, a ronin of Shibata in Echigo. And this is my uncle... And this is my uncle... Oh, never mind the formalities, we must tend to the injured. Yes. Yes. Fortunately, my palanquin is available. Please do not hesitate to use it. Please do not hesitate to use it. Uncle, are you alright? Uncle, are you alright? Hey, bring the palanquin. Uncle, are you alright? I know it's abrupt, but we have a man who was mortally wounded... ...while fighting for the sake of his samurai honor... ...and who wishes to commit seppuku in front of your gate. Please consider our request. How could we... How could we... Hold it. You. Tell me, whose residence do you think this is? I don't know. I don't know. Huh? And yet you still make such a request? Indeed. Clearly, this is not the residence of townsfolk or farmers. So I assumed that it is the residence of a samurai, and came to make my request. And what if it is a samurai mansion? And what if it is a samurai mansion? It's said that samurai mutually support each other. That is so. However, there is such a thing as protocol when it comes to such requests. I understand why you have come here, but there are things we must know... ...before we can consider your request, such as your affiliations, family name, and rank. And if we do so...? And if we do so...? Even then, we cannot permit it. Then we shall withdraw our request to use your gate. Excuse me... follow! Wait... Nagao. Yes sir. Excuse me, wait. We respectfully ask that you come inside the gate. We can go inside? We can go inside? Indeed. We can go inside? Indeed. He said we cannot do it outside the gate. We can go inside? Indeed. He said we cannot do it outside the gate. Correct. It would be disrespectful to permit a samurai to commit seppuku outside the gate. We shall make the proper arrangements within the walls. Such are the instructions of the Tayu. Such are the instructions of the Tayu. "Ta... Tayu?" You mean, he's a chamberlain? Correct. Chisaka Hyobu, Edo chamberlain of the Yonezawa fief in Unshu Province. This mansion belongs to the Uesugi clan. Yes. Let us go. Let us go. Yes sir. I am obliged. I am much obliged. By order of Chief Shogunate retainer Okubo Kaganokami... ...I was assigned to inspect the offices of various Shogunate vassals. "Map of the territories of vassals" The duel occurred on the very day of my departure. Over the course of the next month, I heard, everywhere I went, of the popularity... ...of the Horiuchi Itto-ryu school, as exemplified by Nakayama Yusubei. And also of the loss of face suffered by my school, Chishin-ryu. Eventually, after I had completed my assignment and returned to Edo... "The Divine Chishin-ryu ('four worlds of the whole mind') Sakaki Chishinsai Dojo" The Murakami brothers and their students died on the sword of Nakayama Yasubei. But we have witnesses that saw you at the very site while it was happening. All three of us clearly saw you there. Why then, if you were there, did you just watch the Murakamis die? I did not watch them die. At the time I passed by... ...the Murakami brothers, Nakatsugawa Yuken, and others, were still alive. But as I was on official, Shogunate business... ...I judged that my orders did not permit me to become involved. Coward! Coward! There's no excuse! Coward! There's no excuse! You were cowardly! Then let me ask you something. You also witnessed the destruction of the Murakami's entire school. So why then did you all not retaliate against Nakayama Yasubei? Are you kidding? We're not skilled enough for that. And we have never been in an actual swordfight. I too have never killed anyone. Enough of this nonsense! We are having this discussion because you are a distinguished member of our dojo. In order to avenge the Murakami brothers and their students... ...and thereby restore the reputation of the Chishin-ryu school... ...we have no option but to challenge Nakayama Yasubei to a duel. What have you to say? It would probably be futile. It would probably be futile. How dare you! Explain yourself. After seeing what happened to the Murakami brothers... Note: Tenzen is using an expression that means "an undisciplined, inept mob." ...he is unlikely to be defeated by a "murder of crows". A murder of crows?! A murder of crows?! Then what if you, Sir Tangé, were to challenge him personally? I will not do so. Now, if you will excuse me. You coward! You coward! Shame on you! You coward! Shame on you! Have you no concern for your fellow students? Have you no concern for your fellow students? Have you no understanding of bushido? Have you no concern for your fellow students? Have you no understanding of bushido? Traitor! Have you no concern for your fellow students? Have you no understanding of bushido? Traitor! Have you no understanding of bushido? Traitor! And what if I were a traitor? And what if I were a traitor? This is what! And what if I were a traitor? "Tangé Tenzen" Note: Tangé's nameplate has been taken off the wall, implying that he's been thrown out of the school. "Tangé Tenzen" "Nakayama Yasubei" Sir Chishinsai's dismissal of Tangé Tenzen... ...is a signal to us, the Itto-ryu school, that he desires to... ...end the interminable state of hostility that exists between our two schools. In other words, by removing the central figure of the Chishin-ryu school... ...he has diminished the resolve of his students. It is a pragmatic way to prevent future incidents. Knowing this to be the case, I too must respond to his thoughtfulness in kind. This the true, and only, reason why you are being dismissed from our school. I understand. And I would have all of you understand my intent. There he is. Here they come again. Right now, he's the most popular guy in all of Edo. Even the Kabuki actors are envious. Be quiet! We must get them out of here! You can't do this! You must leave! You're a total heartthrob, aren't you? I hear you're getting marriage proposals left and right. I'm just a ronin, barely scrounging enough work to feed myself. How can I afford a wife? How are your employment prospects? Yes sir. I have received two or three offers... From Lord Matsudaira of the Saijo fief in Iyo, the former master of my late uncle Sugeno. Also, from the clan of Lord Nosé-Izumo, the Shogunate master of firearms. And also, from Chamberlain Asano, of Ako in Banshu. Note: Asano will become the leader of the famous 47 Ronin. And...? I am undecided about all of them. Actually, I have another offer for you; they've been urging me to ask you. As a matter of fact, they have sent a messenger... ...and he is waiting in the back, even as we speak. The offer is from the chief retainer of the Uesugi clan of Yonezawa. Sir Chisaka Hyobu? Sir Chisaka Hyobu? That's right. Your visitor is Sir Nagao Ryunoshin... ...who has come here on behalf of Sir Chisaka. What an honor. What an honor. Also with him is his younger sister, Lady Chiharu. My daughter and Lady Chiharu are tea-ceremony friends. They are both students of the Sohen-ryu school of tea. They're old friends; they've participated together in Lord Kira's tea parties together, and so on. We're all connected in strange ways, aren't we? It has been a while since we last met. It is good to see you in fine health. This is my younger sister, Chiharu. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Until that moment, my heart had never leaped at the sight of a woman. I've been surrounded by many women since the Takata-no-baba duel. But not one of them had captured my heart. Welcome home. Miss Oshizu, it's you. Miss Oshizu, it's you. As you were not here, I let myself in. As you were not here, I let myself in. It's alright. As you were not here, I let myself in. It's alright. It's alright. I came to receive the finished products and to deliver materials. I appreciate it. "Uzen-ya" Move! Move! Make way! Open up! Young Miss. Young Miss. Look. Those samurai are having another staring contest. What will you do if they've been sent to discuss marriage proposals with Nakayama-san? You're driving me nuts. Get yourself together! It's a "Noble Dog"! It's a "Noble Dog"! It's a "Noble Dog"! Don't go near the "Noble Dog"! Hurry up and run! "Tinker, Genpachi" Please. Ahead of me. No, don't mind me. You go first. Elders have precedence. Please go first. Well... Well... Please... Well... Please... I'm in no particular hurry. Please go ahead. Oh no, please, you first. It was a time when a dog had more value than a person. They were referred to as "Noble Dogs" by edict... ...of the fifth generation Shogun Tsunayoshi, based on his pity for all living things. Needless to say, the killing of birds, beasts, and fish... ...and even insects such as butterflies and dragonflies, was strictly forbidden. And in particular, when it came to dogs... ...if anyone kicked them, stepped on them, or was cruel to them... ...they would be sentenced to hang by their legs. Anyone who caused injury to a dog would be beheaded. And crucifiction awaited any offender who killed or poisoned a dog, and so on. "Senshu-in" (Temple) However, I would have never imagined that such a calamity would befall me. "Hut for the Noble Dog" "Shichimen-zan [Temple], Senshu-in" Be careful, it's the dog-hut patrol. Oh. Nakayama-uji. "-uji:" More polite than "-san," similar to "-sama". You... I saw you the other day when I was running to Takata-no-baba. Yes. Tangé Tenzen. Yes. Tangé Tenzen. How do you do... You'll be in serious trouble if someone sees you. Leave here immediately. But... But... You'll have no excuse with that blood on your sword. Let me deal with this matter. I cannot impose such a burden on you. I should handle this; I'm just a ronin with nothing to lose. I am grateful for your kindness. Be well. Go, quickly. It appears to be a woman. However, I am a monk. Benkei decided to leave, and not attack him... ...however, Ushiwaka insulted him, kicking the handle of his Naginata as he passed. "You are violent, and I will teach you a lesson"... ...Benkei declared as he picked up his Naginata. Naginata in hand, he said, "I will show you my skill." Benkei aimed a killing blow at Ushiwaka, but Ushiwaka was unruffled... Look at that drunken loon. Wait a minute, he's doing the sacred dance- oblation to the god Shichimen. How laudable of him. Shichimen was my late mother's protector deity. After she had my big brother Ryunoshin... ...she prayed to him to have a daughter next, and her wish was granted. That's why she named me after this temple, Senshu... ...so that I would continue receiving the deity's blessings. After Senshu Temple? Note: These logograms can be read as both "Senshu" or, more commonly, "Chiharu." Oh. That's why your name is Chiharu. Yes. Today is my mother's memorial day. I see. Does Tangé-dono worship here too? "-dono:" Quite polite, similar to "-sama". No, Tangé-sama is... No, Tangé-sama is... Huh? No, Tangé-sama is... Huh?...a very close friend of the abbot. Oh. They play Go together. Oh. They play Go together. Yes. Oh. They play Go together. Yes. I see. Um... if you dropped in even for a short while, my father and brother would be delighted. Regarding the matter of your employment... ...Sir Chisaka is constantly hounding my brother, asking if you've decided. Well, as to which offer I will accept... ...the truth is, I've just made up my mind. I will drop by and visit your brother soon. But today, I have some unfinished business. You will be disposing of the Noble Dog? In an instant, my heart was set. Chiharu is my life. She is the one and only woman I will ever love. I will live for the sake of my love for her, and die for the sake of thatlove. And as for the offer of a position, I decided to dedicate my life to it. We have something to discuss with you. Concerning what? We would like to see a demonstration of the Horiuchi Itto-ryu style. And who might you all be? We are the vengeance of the Murakami brothers! Nakayama-dono. I am most grateful for the service you have done me. Because of you, I was able to avoid calamity. I wanted to express my thanks, and thus I followed after you. Oh! Tangé. Excuse me, Nakayama-uji. I am indebted to Nakayama-uji. If you will not depart, you will have to face me first. How bizarre. Strike him down. Retreat. If you attack, you will see blood. So you refuse to listen. So you have decided about the position? Yes sir. Regarding that issue... Things seem to be going very well today. Chiharu-dono of the Nagaoka family is here too. Hers is yet another matter that merits congratulations. Huh? Since her marriage has been decided... ...and since she won't be able to casually go about as she pleases after that... ...she's enjoying some frivolity with Namino, as a last hurrah. Who is to be her husband? Who is to be her husband? Oh? You didn't know? Not at all. Not at all. Well you're not keeping up. It's been the talk of the town for a long time now. And you have a considerable connection to him as well. It's Chishin-ryu's Tangé Tenzen. So you and Tangé-sama...? Yeah, but you know, I go and pray to Shichimen every month, right? And Tangé-sama is there all the time, playing Go with the abbot. So one thing led to another, and the two of us... You'll incur divine wrath on yourself, using Shichimen as a matchmaker! Now, down to the business of government... Yes. Truly... I am sorry to say... Huh? Huh? I want to continue enjoying the carefree life of a ronin. What? Please forgive me for my continuous and insolent lack of courtesy. Note: This Noh song, "Takasagoya," is sung in traditional weddings. Oh from Takasago, raise the mast of the light ship... raise the mast... of the light ship. As the tide swells, let us set sail along with the moon. Beyond the waves looms the Isle of Awaji... ...and far beyond the open seas of Naruo... ...swiftly we sail, and arrive at Sumino-é. Though I had wished for a position with the Uesugi clan... ...contrary to my will, I came to serve the Asano clan instead. Perhaps this is my destiny. Our target tonight is Kira Kozukénosuke. Who knew he was the father of Lord Uesugi? Really? Nakayama Yasubei got adopted? Yes, by Horibé-sama. Really? Does Horibé have a daughter who has come of age, perhaps? He does have a daughter, but I hear she's only 12 or 13. Yes... I saw her with a group of children at Takata-no-baba. The oblation-offerings have been prepared. Hmm... was that a cat? Or a dog? No, the laws are so stringent, none of our neighbors keep pets. Then what is that? Perhaps an assistant of Inari, the mansion's guardian deity. Note: Inari is depicted as a fox-deity. A fox, huh? I pray every day to Inari that you will be returning as quickly as possible. I can only be as fast as my duties allow. Let's see. My duty in Kyoto will take me through to the third month... ...about the time of the Hina festival. By the time of the Hina festival, I'll have earned enough... ...to send you some of Kyoto's famous husband-and-wife Dairi Hina dolls. No, I want you to come home as fast as you can. Who cares about Hina dolls? Oh. Please wait a moment. This is a Hina doll I made when I was a child. Please take it with you on your journey, and think of it as me, Chiharu. Chiharu. Yes. Chiharu... My dear... How did you spend your day? How are you doing? Did your duties go smoothly and without impediment? I, Chiharu, finally finished this. Does it look good on me? Starting tonight, I am going to sleep in this from now on. Do you like it? My dear. Chiharu is going to go rest now. Poor thing, all alone. Here, let me give you dinner, as usual. Chiharu will keep you company. Here. A broth of horsetail shoots. Oh, it's not to your liking? Chiharu will take it away. How about some pickled fish this time? I'm so glad. You like it? Oh yes. I've been so concerned with the food, I forgot about saké. But since this is the Sekku festival, for girls... ...you'll have to drink white saké to keep Chiharu company. Oh, you're going to pour some for Chiharu too? I'll gratefully keep you company. My, one after another like this. I'll get drunk if I have too much. Oh, it's so good. But if you're not going to be drinking... ...it's truly boring. My, I'm so drunk. What's the matter with me? Chiharu. What happened? Hey. Hey. Hmm? Hey. Hmm? We shouldn't be wasting any time. If anyone in the mansion sees us, there'll be trouble. Let's just bring her out. Let's just bring her out. Alright. My Lady! My Lady! What happened? My Lady! My Lady! My Lady! My Lady! They found out. Alright, I better go and... Wait. This should teach Tangé a lesson. Keep the woman alive for our future enjoyment. You did a good job. Here's the promised payment. I know about the sequence of events from the courier. Did something else happen? Yes. I couldn't explain it all in a letter before you got back to Edo... ...so I wanted to tell you everything in person. Kajihei. Kajihei. Yes. They bribed Mié to help them, and then killed her. But she confessed before she died, and we have the names of the culprits. You say there were five of them? You say there were five of them? Yes. They were all present... ...when you, My Lord, defended Nakayama Yasubei-dono... So they are all from the Chishin-ryu school? That is correct. They were injured in their scuffle with you, My Lord. One lost most of his fingers when you struck his hand. That would be Mita Shirogoro. Another lost an eye when he got cut from his forehead to cheek. That was Iki Rentaro. A third had the area from his nose to upper lip sliced off. I believe that was Niki So'émon. The next one had the side of his face sliced off down to his jaw; he even lost an ear. I'm certain that was Tomonari Mikinosuké. And the last tripped, resulting in his shin being gashed. That was Totani Hyoma. I see. So it was those five. Others were also hurt, but those five had serious injuries they could not conceal. They were exiled from the dojo, they lost their positions, and they all became ronin. So they held a grudge, and... So they held a grudge, and... Yes. Old man... how much of this has become public knowledge? Well... you see... So it's quite the news. If I may, My Lord. Of course the five won't admit that they did it. But... ...there are rumors of another man that Her Ladyship spoke with, before the wedding. What? And that when you were not home, My Lord, she would receive him. They're saying she was having an affair? So if they're spreading that rumor, there must be someone who witnessed it? Yes. And they're saying it was not just once, but twice, then three times... ...and that there can be no doubt about it. So who is it? Who is the man that Chiharu was seeing from before the wedding? Well... it's... Well... it's... Who is it? Nakayama Yasubei-sama. But why would Nakayama Yasubei have been seeing Chiharu before the wedding? Come to think of it, there was that stray dog incident at Shichimenzan Temple. So Chiharu knew Nakayama Yasubei from that time. Tangé-dono. Nakayama-uji. Nakayama-uji. My surname has been changed. I am now Horibé Yasubei. My apologies. My apologies. Oh no, as you are. It has been a very long time since we last met. How has your lady been? Well, thankfully. I have not seen Chiharu-dono since the wedding. I do miss her. And you, Nakayama... no, Horibé-uji, are you married yet? Oh no, that will have to wait. The girl is still only 13. Is that so? Well, if you would excuse me. Well, if you would excuse me. Excuse me. Please give Chiharu-dono my best regards. Yes. Excuse me. Goodbye. Old man. Old man. Yes? Yes? I get it now. Yes? I get it now. I get it now. Huh? The five villains hate both Nakayama-uji and myself. If Nakayama-uji and I were to fight, they would be killing two birds with one stone. It's a ploy to make us self-destruct. It's a ploy to make us self-destruct. Oh... indeed. Old man. Have you heard of Momonji-ya? Old man. Have you heard of Momonji-ya? Momonji-ya? Hey, Yasubei. Our groom-to-be. Hey, Yasubei. Our groom-to-be. Oh, I have just returned. Welcome home... Sure, sure. Well, it's just 10 days until the imperial envoy arrives. Yes. Yes. The official advisor, Lord Kira, is being deliberately unhelpful... ...and Lord Asano has no choice but to bow like this and say "Please excuse me." This is a very difficult time for our lord; all I can do... ...is keep praying that the important duty of entertaining the imperial envoy... ...will go smoothly, and without a hitch. That must have been stressful for you too, Father. As the old saying goes... "Far from court, far from care." Whoops. I can't very well say such a thing to our groom, can I? You were always telling me about how carefree it was to be a ronin... ...and who was the old man that forcefully talked you out of it? By the way... ...during your ronin days, you were chased by all the girls. I saw it with my own eyes too. However, rumor has it that our groom... ...has an eye for an upstanding Shogunate retainer's wife. They're saying that you are having a secret, adulterous relationship with her. Huh? Huh? It's an absurdity. The jackasses! Who said such a thing? Who said such a thing? I'm not telling, not telling. Because if I told you, you'd go and kill them. Which vassal are they talking about? Which vassal are they talking about? Ahem! "I'm afraid our Yasubei will have a loving wife who is the best in the world." "He doesn't have any interest in some other man's wife." That's how I reproved them. If only Oko here would come of age sooner, I'd have you both married at once. Otei. Otei. Yes? Otei. Yes? Why is Oko so slow to grow? Because, my dear... Because, my dear... It's because you're not raising her properly. But that's something that can't be... my dear... What are you saying? You were 13 when we were wed. You were already a grown woman. Dear... Welcome home. I am prepared for the consequences. Please punish me. I have been waiting for you to touch me... ...and thus I have wearily endured life until this day. If we were townsfolk or farmers, this incident could be forgotten. But such is not the case for the samurai. You are a married woman who was violated by several men. Such a woman can no longer be called a man's wife. I know that all too well. However, if we were to separate... ...with the circumstances already public knowledge... ...it would be tantamount to my making you commit suicide. I cannot let that happen. But since the public believes you have committed adultery... ...naturally, I will lose face as a samurai if I do not kill you. I cannot let that happen either. What wrong have you done, anyway? We have been ensnared by their cowardly ploy. One... There is definitely one way out of this, but... ...it is inevitable that we will have to part ways. Darling! I am a woman whose body has been thoroughly defiled. I'm finished. Chiharu. Do not die, Chiharu. No matter what happens, you mustn't die. Because if you disobey me and kill yourself... ...remember that you will not be my wife again for seven lifetimes. We have located the item that you ordered us to acquire. Well done. When can I have it? We can deliver it whenever you wish. Can you maintain secrecy? This involves breaking the edict of sympathy for living creatures. If our involvement were to become known, our lives would be forfeit. So you see... To celebrate the end of my assignment, my father, Ryunoshin... ...along with our closest relatives, wish to share some drinks. And then? And then? Chiharu, don't say anything else. Just silently follow me. Yes. Not a big deal. I've been enjoying the famous Tangé-Kyoto cherry-blossoms of Edo... ...and it's a good excuse to indulge in some bad singing. News from the mountains, the cherry blossoms bloom. The cherry blossoms are blooming in the mountains. Those are Usu-zakura blossoms from Mount Kurama. Broken branches placed on the road will guide you. Led to the mountain, you will see the blossoms along the way. You come under trees... ...gaze at the blossoms. If you find a house... ...with cherry blossoms, you may enter. Noble or commoner, relative or stranger, you may enter. Such is the custom in the spring. Take that. Son-in-law... What happened? The mystery is now solved. What mystery? What mystery? Yes. There are those among you, I believe... ...who have heard allegations about unacceptable behavior by Chiharu. But in truth, taking advantage of my absence... ...the bedroom of my wife has indeed been invaded. Insolence! Chiharu would never do anything immoral! As for the true culprit, he has just now been revealed. Please see for yourselves. Oh. Oh! Oh. Oh! Oh. Oh. Oh! Oh. It's a fox. It's an old and venerable fox. So it was a fox who was responsible. It was all the doing of a shape- shifting monster. Until this happened, on this very night, I was very much concerned. However, even if this clears Chiharu-dono... ...and even if this monster was a shape-shifter, it's still a fox. We can't harm a living creature, violating the imperial prohibition... ...and yet avoid the Shogunate's punishment. We've got a serious problem. We've got a serious problem. Tangé-uji, what are you going to do? If this event becomes public knowledge... ...then rumors will spread that Chiharu has been unfaithful. Fortunately, all of us are close relatives. If we are to protect Chiharu's honor... ...tonight's event must be kept to ourselves, close to our chests. Yes, yes, what other way is there? We can avoid bringing shame upon my daughter, and it will help Tangé too. It is sufficient that her relatives believe in her innocence. As to the fox-slaying incident, it's a secret. A secret. Indeed. Tangé-dono, that was superbly done. Truly yours is the finest example of Chishin-ryu swordsmanship. It was two or three days later, a day I will never forget... It was the 14th day of the 3rd month of the 14th year of the Genroku period. Together we left the house early in the morning... ...and visited my mother's grave at Shichimen-sama's. This will be the last time that we walk together as husband and wife. We are going to the Nagao household now. You will be returning to your original home today. Had you been sent back with your honor sullied by immorality and adultery... ...you would have had to kill yourself. This, in turn, would give credit to rumors that Horibé was your lover. I have erased the stain of immorality, but... ...there is something that cannot be erased, no matter what. And that is your defilement by those Chishin-ryu bastards. You are not guilty, so I will not have you punished. But I cannot allow myself to hold your body. My reason, my mind, permits it, but my body cannot. We have to part. I do love you. This is because I love you. And once we separate, what then will you do? I will request to be relieved of my official duties, and once I am free... ...I am going to kill those five bastards. What is it, Chiharu? It's so early. You're here by yourself? No... um... Where's Tangé-uji? He's with Father right now. You're crying. What's going on? What? You cannot tell me the reason, no matter what? Yes. Yes. Chiharu knows the reason why you're leaving her, I hope? She knows. She knows. Fine. Then I'll ask Chiharu. Chiharu will not tell you either. No, she will definitely not tell you. This is a matter between husband and wife, and only between husband and wife. That's unacceptable. How can a samurai take back his daughter without knowing the reason? But Chiharu is also aware of this. But Chiharu is also aware of this. Hold it. Let me ask you something. Unfortunately, I wasn't present at the fox-incident... ...but no one suspects Chiharu of immorality and adultery anymore, is that not correct? Not in the slightest. Not in the slightest. And will you attest there is nothing shady about Chiharu in any way? Absolutely. Otherwise, I myself would have punished her. It is because there is nothing of the kind, that I would have you take her back. This is absurd. This is absurd. But Chiharu knows about it. This is absurd. But Chiharu knows about it. She might, but I don't. So it's unacceptable. In other words, it's a vicious circle; it can't be explained by words. If not by words, then perhaps with swords. If that is what you desire, I will gladly comply. That is what I desire! Big Brother. Big Brother. Move. Move. No. Move. No. No. Will you defy your big brother? Darling. Darling. Don't come near me. It... It is as you have desired... Let that arm be my payment. Please take Chiharu... ...back into your care. Hey, hey. Where do you think you're going? The imperial envoy and his entourage will soon be arriving. You must use a different route. You must use a different route. Yes. Sorry about that. Come on. Wait. Is someone injured? Yes. Yes. I would be forsaking my duty if I were to let blood defile the imperial envoy's path. I will have to investigate. I will have to investigate. Yes. What is his name and status? What is his name and status? Tangé Tanzen, of the clan of Lord Tozawa Ise-no-kami. Wait. I am the chamberlain of the Uesugi clan, Chisaka Hyobu. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes sir. Is it Tangé-uji, the relative of Nagao Ryunoshin of the Uesugi clan? It is indeed. Everyone, everyone gather! We have a major incident! Have you gone mad? Have you gone mad? We are within the palace walls! On the very day I was returned to my original home... ...and my husband Tenzen lost his arm because of my brother... ...in the "hall of pines" of the Shogun's palace, Lord Asano of the Ako fief... ...attacked Lord Kira Kozukénosuke, the father of the current Lord of the Uesugi clan... ...whose family my family, the Nagao, has served for generations. And since that day, Tenzen was never seen again. My dear. Chiharu-dono. I asked around at the Shichimen temple, but no one there has seen him either. His whereabouts are completely unknown. Horibé-sama said that he was visiting comrades to promote the revival... ...of the Asano Clan, with Lord Asano's brother Daigaku as the new lord. He said he was next going to Kamigata. Even one year later, as our plot to avenge ourselves upon Kira proceeded... ...I still had no idea at all where Tangé Tenzen was. Then, at Maebara Isuke's rice shop, which we were using to spy on Kira's mansion... "RICE" (Rice Shop Gohei) The lady who is Kira's tea-ceremony partner just came out the mansion. What? What? I had Emoshichi keep watch for people involved in the world of tea... ...because they might provide useful information. I'm going to follow her. I'm going to follow her. Yeah. Wait, this isn't good. I'm wearing a tea-ceremony outfit. I'll be conspicuous. Hey. Somebody else go. Yeah, I'll do it. "Rice Shop" Welcome home. "Shiho'an Sohen-ryu School of Tea" Our Namino and Lady Chiharu are tea-ceremony friends. They are both students of the Sohen-ryu school of tea. They're old friends; they've participated together in Lord Kira's tea parties together, and so on. Um... it's urgent. From the chief retainer. From Sir Chisaka Hyobu? From Sir Chisaka Hyobu? Yes. Tenzen is still alive. Tenzen is still alive. Oh... where is he now? I figured he's too good a man to let die. I sent him to the mineral hot springs... ...of Shirabu Takayu outside of Yonezawa, so that he could recover from his wound. I thank you so much. The reason why I asked you here, is to ask you to go and fetch him. What? I know he feels indebted to me, but I don't want to impose upon him. What do you want him to do? I have written down the essentials. I've hired men to guard the Kira mansion... ...but they're hungry for money, and I cannot be sure of them. So in other words, you would have Tangé supervise these men? That's right. To keep a leash on them, he can do whatever it takes... ...whether it's killing them, reducing their numbers, whatever. Needless to say, I will reward him handsomely. He won't take a reward. He won't take a reward. He will get the reward upfront. Among these men, there are five that can definitely be disposed of. That's right, five men. Five men. Do you understand? There are five of them... I needn't tell you their names, you know who they are. Surely this is enough to entice Tangé back to Edo. "To Sir Tangé Tenzen" Old man. Old man. Yes. My life was spared, and yet I now am going to go and kill... or perhaps be killed? Ours is a twisted world of warring titans. Yes. Here I teetered on the brink of death for some months... I feel wistful about leaving these hot springs. Where do you think Tangé went? Who cares. He's vanished, that's what matters. He better not show himself either, because this time, I'll... There's still Horibé. Are the Ako guys planning revenge or not? Maybe Sir Chisaka's hunch is wrong, after all. Hey, Uesugi men. Sir Chisaka Hyobu has passed away. What? I see. Without Sir Chisaka, we no longer have access to the Kira mansion. Now that that's over with, the question is how can I make a living? Please, my dear. You needn't worry about such things. I'll gladly take care of you. That will not happen. Who cut my arm off, and why? It is not that it was cut off. I let him cut it off. My arm was the price I paid to return you to their care. You are now a woman of the Nagao clan. No, no. I stood up to my brother and ran away. Ever since then... ...I've been making a living all by myself. The Nagao clan and I are no longer... Enough. Make no mistake about this. I did not come back because you came to fetch me. I returned to repay... ...Sir Chisaka for his kindness; you should know that by now. I have always known it. If so, then don't be so presumptuous. How could you offer to support the husband who left you? Kajihei! Yeah. Yeah. Remember this. From this day on, this woman is not allowed to visit me. But sir, we no longer have access to the Kira mansion. No, I shall get them. I will get those five bastards, no matter what. However, old man. I have to pay my debt to the deceased... ...who arranged it so that I could pursue my vendetta. So, to repay Sir Chisaka, you will ally yourself with the Kira faction... ...and oppose the men of Ako? That's right, I will use the broken body that he saved from death. Until I can repay him for his favor. I can talk the talk... ...but talk can't kill anyone. How far can I go with only one arm? Since Chiharu has returned to her home, she must no longer be Tangé's wife. So what? What of it? Though nothing has been formalized yet... ...I have a woman to whom I am effectively betrothed. What do I want with Chiharu? I went together with chief retainer Oishi and had a look... ...and Kira's new mansion is starting to take shape. Yes. They're planning on moving from the Uesugi mansion sometime this month. Well, this is what the chief retainer says to do. Otaka... Yes. Yes. Is the tea master having a year-end tea party by any chance? It is as you say. It is as you say. Will Kira have the tea party at his adopted son's... ...or will it be held at his new mansion? You are right. How absent- minded of me. He will have the party at his own tea room, which he's very proud of. He will most certainly do that. Then, on that day, they will most likely leave Uesugi... ...make preparations at the mansion, and spend the night there. That will be the night... That will be the night... I see. That will be the night... I see. That night will be our one-in-a-million chance. Indeed. Indeed. If only there was a way we could find out when the exact day will be... ...our vengeance will be as good as accomplished. I have discovered that the master of ceremonies at Kira's tea party... ...is going to be Shiho-an Yamada Sohen himself. How do you know that? How do you know that? Horibé, do you have contacts? Yes. I have a few people that can be called that. Alright, I'm next. Take that! Hey. Tangé's alive, and he's back. What? He's putting on a 5-mon street show in Ueno. "Mon:" The smallest monetary unit, akin to a penny. It's a lousy 5-mon per challenger, but it adds up to a day's wages. You must be tired. Old man. Old man. Yeah. Old man. Yeah. Chiharu was here, wasn't she? Old man. Yeah. Chiharu was here, wasn't she? Yes. Um... I know it well... Chiharu's scent. What did she want? What did she want? She said that Master Shiho-an will be preparing... ...for the year-end tea party at Lord Kira's. As to the day and time, they're uncertain. But that will probably be the best time for the Ako samurai to launch an attack. I see. Therefore, if a person associated with Asano attempts to confirm the schedule... If such a person approaches Chiharu-sama to learn what she knows... ...then indeed we could infer that they will indeed attack on that day. Understood. So I must get rid of the bastards before that. Is that what you're saying? Old man. They will come to get me first. Yeah? I didn't think my 5-mon plan would yield results this quickly. Today, I saw the bastard Mita Shirogoro in the crowd. He will most likely gather the rest of them, and come after me in the next few days. Will they come, or will they not? They'll come. If the woman reveals to us the tea party schedule, our troubles are over. But if by some chance she suspects our plan, we'll have to kill her. But that won't be easy... Otaka, it's a gruesome task. But you're the only one who knows anything about the world of tea. Hmm... we all have to make sacrifices. Alright. Let's decide who'll be going with you. If anyone gets black, he'll be going with Otaka. Uh... wait. How about this. This task... Can you put me, and me alone in charge of this task? No matter what, I cannotlet anyone else kill Chiharu. If she must killed, then I will do it. To kill Chiharu would be tantamount to killing my own attachments. As I valorously departed to the land of death... ...I would be severing my attachments to this world. Is your teacher home? No, Master Sohen sent for her, and she just left. When is she coming home? When is she coming home? I don't know. But she was going to visit Shichimen Temple first. You see? That's Tangé for sure, isn't it? But he's only got one arm. I dunno, that's the weird part. I was waiting for you. I was waiting for you. T... Tangé! T... Tangé! I was going to cut you to ribbons... T... Tangé! ...but I won't sully my sword on scum that are no better than dogs and beasts. This is how you beasts will be treated! Tangé! That'll teach you. That'll teach you. Ey ho, ey ho, ey ho... Ey ho, ey ho, ey ho... Stop. Oh! Dear! Not good. I'm worried about those two guys; I can't relax. Yeah. Haven't heard a peep from Totani either; he's worried about them too. What happened? What happened? What happened? I plugged Tangé, but I don't know if the wound was mortal. Niki's neck was smashed; he died instantly. Shirogoro's still breathing, but it's just a matter of time... "I don't know. But she said she was going to pay a visit to Shichimen Temple first." It was already dusk when she left... I can't imagine she'd be visiting the grave at night. That can only mean... Maybe Tangé Tenzen is at the temple. Alright, let us do what is chivalrous, and lend a helping hand. Two of the men sent by the Uesugi to aid us have been killed. We must avenge our comrades. We must kill Tangé no matter what! Agreed! Agreed! Agreed, without reservation! Agreed! Agreed, without reservation! We are grateful for your deep kindness. If you say that you've been sent by Chiharu of Nagao, they will accommodate you. Whatever is lacking in the writing, old man, you'll have to convey in words. I understand. I'll take care of it. Perhaps, if the doctor will be delayed, you could also get some medicine. You are so kind. Please endure just a little longer. I have asked Doctor Kyorindo to come. Dear... Dear... Hmm? Thank you so much. Thank you so much. For what? I too have kept this with me at all times. You have forgiven me? Like I told you repeatedly, you were not at fault. Did you think that I was just saying words I did not mean? I'm so sorry. Even if I were to die now... ...I will have no more regrets. Who is it? Who is it? It's been a while. You've come. Tangé, I'll give you your last rites. We'd like to challenge you to a fair fight, but look at the pathetic shape you're in. So you would challenge me to a fair fight? Sure. If you think you can fight us with one arm and one leg. Fine. There's not enough room here. Let us go outside. Dear! Tangé-dono! I, Nakayama Yasubei, will now repay the debt I owe you. Nakayama-sama. Nakayama-sama! Nakayama-sama. The year-end tea party is tomorrow, the 14th, at night. I am much obliged. Dear. Oh from Takasago, raise the mast of the light ship... raise the mast... As the tide swells, let us set sail along with the moon. Beyond the waves looms the Isle of Awaji... ...and far beyond the open seas of Naruo... ...swiftly we sail and arrive at Sumino'é. The End
