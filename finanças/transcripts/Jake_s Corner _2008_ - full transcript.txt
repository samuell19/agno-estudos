Ricki's dipping into the jar. Fire in the mouth, Donald's about to serve a Whirly Derby. - You hear that, Sylvia? Your daughter's got her boyfriend wound up again. - Don't blame me, that's the Brazilian in her. I'm 100% Mexicano. - I hear that. - Hey, Johnny, that Scottsdale crew's inside. Trust-funders on 'roids. - Hey, man, our rifles? They're just a stroll away. - Everything's good, fellas. [lively rock music] [patrons laughing] - Touch her ass again, I'll kill you, man. - It's okay, babe, got it covered. - I don't like this shit. This guy's really pissing me off, you know? - Really? You know? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy, easy. - Why you gotta be such a hard ass, Stan? - Mind your own damn business and go find your has-been boyfriend. - Who's a has-been? Johnny Dunn? - Is that his name? I forgot. - You know what else you forgot? You're not in Scottsdale. - This isn't Club Shit-for-Brains. Hey, we're all has-beens here, right, Johnny? - Absolutely. - Let's stop all this macho bullshit and eat some jalapenos. - Let's get ready! - Jalapenos! [patrons cheering] - Becky said to give you a big hug. - That's not a big hug, that's as shoulder crunch. I'll show you a big hug. - I remember, she said shoulder crunch. That's right; hey, next one's on me. Line one up for Corrinne, too, will you please? Thanks, Dado. - Workin' hard, gettin' thirsty. Workin' hard, gettin' thirsty. Workin' hard, gettin' thirsty. - That girl is driving me crazy, man. - [Bar Patrons] Whoa! - You better simmer down or you're gonna run her off. - If she wanna go, she can go, that's fine with me. - I like havin' her here. - Yeah, you, me, I guess that guy, too. [bar patrons exclaiming in awe] - You like having me around. - Absolutely, Clint. [bar patrons cheering] - Dado, hook me up! - Listen, Clint, I don't serve you until after five. - It's 5:02. - It's 5:02, he says, 5:02. [singing faintly] [crowd whooping] [crowd exclaiming in disappointment] - Clint, I think it's time to take those clothes to the laundromat. - Time to work, time to drink. [crowd hollering] No time to go to the sink. - Tomorrow, take two hours off your work day and go wash those clothes. - [Crowd] Six! - Okay, boss, tomorrow. - [Crowd] Seven! - I think you're starting to twitch, Stan. - Come on, Stan, we have a lot of money ridin' on you, man. - Ready for number eight, tough guy? - [Man] Give him some water!

[crowd cheering] [crowd applauding] [people whistling] [singing faintly] [people speaking faintly] [crowd applauding] [crowd cheering] [people speaking faintly] [singing faintly] [telephone ringing] [motorcycle engines rumbling] - Jake's Corner. Fran, it's Gus. The sheriff? Fran, there's only one person who answers this phone, and there's only one person who calls this phone, and guess what? We're both on the phone. This is the fifth time that you've called today. - Johnny Dunn. - Lianus is back at the Corner with a new pair of shades. - Eh, thought I'd come back and pursue my true calling, stacking shelves and cleaning bait tanks. - Welcome back, Lianus. - He just misses his mother. - Don't we all? - I know he comes to visit you every Sunday. Maybe he's planning on coming up later. Fran, this phone is for emergency use only. What? There's a bear outside your trailer? Come on, Fran, take one of your pills and take a nap. Better yet, take two of your pills; yah! [telephone clunks] [telephone ringing] Fran, I said emergencies only. [knocking at door] [knocking at door] - [Johnny] What is it? - Phone call. [footsteps echoing] - Yeah, this is Johnny Dunn. Are they alive? Are they alive, just answer my question. I'm comin' down there. Oh, no. [receiver clatters] [slow sad guitar music] No. [gravel crunching] Gus? [engine rumbling] [horn blaring] [slow sad guitar music] [footsteps echoing] [door latch clicks] [door bangs] [morgue table rattles] That's him, Patrick. [morgue table rattles] [morgue table clicks] [morgue table rattles] Your face, it's so clean. - [Officer] Her chest was pinned between the seats. She suffocated. - That's Becky, my sister. [morgue table rattles] Where's the boy? [sirens wailing] - [Woman] Dr. Johnson. Doctor [speaking faintly]. - I'm Johnny Dunn, the boy's uncle. - Dr. Rivera. - What's his status? - He's stable; he suffered a severe concussion, a small laceration with eight stitches. We'd like to watch him for another 24 hours or so and then he'll be able to go home. - Go home? - I'm sorry. [water sloshing] [dog barking] [door bangs] [dog whining] - Rags. [slow melancholy piano music] Yeah, I'd like to cancel my subscription to the newspaper, Patrick Walsh. That's it, thanks. [Johnny sighs] [slow, melancholy music] [cell phone beeping] - [Kerry] Hello? - Kerry? - [Kerry] Yes? - This is Johnny Dunn. - [Kerry] Oh, hi Johnny, is everything all right? You sound a little, what's going on? - Your brother and my sister were killed in a car accident last night. - [Kerry] What? - To repeat that would be difficult. [Kerry crying softly] Spence survived the accident. [Kerry weeping] The boy needs a home; since you have a home and a husband, three other boys, and I live alone and keep uncle hours, you need to get down here as soon as possible. I'm not much of a phone person, so I'm gonna go now, okay? - [Kerry] Okay. [cell phone beeping] [melancholy music] [dog whining] - [Kerry] How is Spence? - [Johnny] He had a concussion, cut on his forehead. But he's okay, he's gonna be fine. - [Kerry] Does he know? - No. I have a suitcase with some of his clothes and Rags. That dog is a shadow to him, they can't be separated. You'll have to take him, too. - I can't. - What do you mean? - We're adding onto our house. We're living in a hotel out of suitcases. It's chaos. - My lifestyle is not suited for a little boy, Kerry. - It would just be for a couple of months until the house is done. Believe me, I wanna take him, he's my brother's son. [Johnny sighs] - [Johnny] I run a bar, I live in a trailer in the middle of nowhere, you understand that? - [Kerry] I think that you would be the best thing for him right now, Johnny. Patrick always says that Spence idolizes you. - [Johnny] It's easy to idolize an uncle. I come and go as I please. An uncle's role is not to say no. [insects chirring] [thoughtful guitar music] [traffic rumbling] - [Spence] Who is that? - That's Clint. He left here a long time ago, now he's back. [thoughtful guitar music] - Is something wrong with him? - He just likes to walk with his head down. - How come? - The Earth spins less like that for him. [insects chirring] I had Gus call all of you here 'cause I need to get somethin' straight between everyone in this room. You probably know what happened to my sister. What you may not know is that their son, Spence, my nephew, he survived. And he's here, living with me, living with us for a while. He doesn't know his parents were killed. He thinks they're alive, getting well in the hospital, and we're not allowed to visit right now. That's what I told him. He's a boy and he's been through a lot. The good thing is that he doesn't remember anything from the accident. I wanna keep it that way for now. I wanna keep... Lianus, you wanna say something? - So you want us to lie to the boy? - Yeah. I do, I want you to lie. You're gonna see him tomorrow and he's gonna walk around and say something to you and I want you to lie to him. - Don't you think he should know the truth? - I think he should know the truth, and he will, but I will decide when the time and place is. - Lianus, sit down, shut up and pay attention! - That's okay. He's gonna be workin' in the saloon, bus boy. Teach him what you know, treat him with compassion, as I know all of you will, but don't treat him with pity. He's a smart kid and he'll see the difference. I want the Corner to be the Corner as it always is, business as usual. So whatever you have to do to get ready, get ready. Here's your shares. We had a good month this month. Wheels, you pass 'em out? Dado, you lock up? Ricki, you take the bag of groceries up to Fran's? Put some of your mom's beans in it. I couldn't find any in the cooler. She likes those beans. - She does? - Hmm. - I just made a new batch, I'll go get some. - Okay. [zipper on bag rasps] - I never even met Spence. So what am I supposed to say to the boy? - You say nothing, you just be yourself. - Gus. [insects chirring] - John? How can this happen again? - Gus. - We go way back, since our freshman year at U of A, and I've been blockin' for you ever since, right? - Right. - So I can tell you how I feel inside, right? - Right. [bird calling] - Spence asleep? - He is. - I been trying to hold it together, but it ain't easy, bro. Becky's gone! [broom thuds] [Gus weeping] - Don't think of me, or Becky, or what's happened in the past or why it's happening again, it just is. Think of Spence. He doesn't need his whole world turned upside down because you can't hold it together. - How are you gonna do that? - Gus, listen. Look at me. Trust me, I can deal with this. But I need your help, you know what I'm sayin'? Spence is gonna look you right in the eye, either tomorrow or the next day, and he's gonna talk to you about his mother. You know he will. You can't be sad in front of him, all right? - All right. - I know how much you care, Gus. I know how much you care. You can do this. [Gus sniffling] - All right. - Gus. Remember Stanford game, senior year? I fumbled the ball, you picked it up and ran the wrong way. [Gus chuckling] I never asked you this, but didn't it feel strange that no one else was chasing you but me? - I thought that you were cheerin' me on until you tackled me on the two-yard line. - It was a tough decision. Either let you score two points for the wrong team or tackle you before you crossed the line, and now it's third and 98. - And the very next play, you run 98 yards for a touchdown. - I had 44 slot right off the left tackle. Big Gus McPhillamy, number 75 from Jersey. You pancaked that defensive end. And I was gone. - I was pissed! - You were. See you tomorrow, Gus. - Goodnight, bro. - I'd like you to sleep inside with me tonight. I'm feeling sad. - Why don't you sleep outside with me? - [Ricki] There's too many creepy crawlers. - [Dado] I'll protect you. - [Ricki] How the hell you gonna protect me from a spider or scorpion? - Spiders, scorpions? If you don't feel safe with me, then you sleep inside. - Fine, I'll sleep at my mom's. - I'll still sleep outside, what's the big deal? - You'll miss me one day, you know that? - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - It means nothing. - I miss a lot of people that I never planned on missing. - This is far enough for you, I'll take it from here. - What's the big deal? I'm already here. - Johnny said only me, you might scare her, stay back. Give me the bag, please. [coyotes howling] - [Fran] Who is it? - Fran, it's Ricki. From the Corner. Johnny wanted me to drop off some groceries for you. - [Fran] Who's with you? - That's just me. - [Fran] I heard an angry man's voice out there. - [Ricki] That's my boyfriend, Dado, don't worry. - [Fran] Leave the bag on the steps and go away! Now go away! [coyotes howling] - Angry man's voice? That woman is really crazy. - You are angry; let's go. - Ah, yeah, [speaking in foreign language]. [birds twittering] [gentle rock music] - [Spence] Who are you? - I'm Lianus. - Like, in Charlie Brown, Linus? - Yeah, like in Charlie Brown, Linus. Spelled different. - I'm Spence, this is my dog, Rags. - Like in rags to riches. - I've never seen you here before. - My mom is Peg. - You look like my friend, Richie Dean. - Is Richie Dean black? - Yeah, kind of. Richie's mom is black and his dad was white. His dad ran away before he was born. - Runaway dads, it's an epidemic. - What's that? - Richie Dean and I, we got a lot in common. - My mom's a painter, are you? - I'm an artist. - What's the difference? - A painter paints things. An artist creates a work of art. - Do artists wear dark sunglasses in the morning? [blues singer sings faintly] [Lianus chuckling] [blues singer sings faintly] What is it? - It's Queen Kong, King Kong's brother. - King Kong's brother's a queen? - I'm afraid so. - Looks like a mean queen. - It's tough being called a queen when your brother's called a king. - He doesn't like it, huh? - No. - Maybe he'll be called king one day. [Lianus scoffs] - I doubt it. - Spence, you gotta let me know when you go someplace. - I don't have to tell my mom and dad when I go down the street. - This isn't your street, it's a desert, and I don't get up early. - King Kong has a brother named Queen. - What? - Queen Kong, look. [blues singer sings faintly] - Spence, would you do me a favor and go in the store and tell Peg I'd like a cup of coffee? - Okay, bye, Lianus. Come on, Rags. - What is this? - King Kong's brother. - King Kong's brother, Queen. - It's no big deal, Johnny. I was being me like you said to be. - Okay, you're right, thanks. - I'm gonna sleep in here late, like Elvis. - I guess not. - [Radio Host] 95 degrees under clear skies and the fire hazard has increased. KRN 90 [speaking faintly] [Spence speaks faintly] Friday night fish fry. - Oh, Clint. [blues guitar music] Gee whiz, Clint, put some clothes on. - They're in the wash. - Did my nephew see you? - Who? - Get in the bathroom. - What for? - You're naked, Clint. - [scoffs] I know that, Johnny. - Come on, get in here. [door bangs] Peg, where are the rain ponchos? - Second aisle back, top shelf. [blues guitar music] - Are we going fishing, Uncle Johnny? - No, we're gonna feed Walter Payton. - Who's Walter Payton? - He's our pet bass. He survived the drought. - Why are you wearing a rain poncho? It hasn't rained in 100 days. - I don't know. Johnny thinks there's a storm comin' or somethin'. - There's not one cloud in the sky. - Clint, this is my nephew, Spence. - Hi, little guy. - Go finish the laundry, Clint. - Peg, how long does it take to wash the clothes? - Well, I've never timed it, Clint, but I'd say around 30 minutes. - [Johnny] Let's go, Spence. Thanks, Peg. - See ya. [blues guitar music] - Hey, Peg? Can I have a Slim Jim and a Budweiser? - [Peg] It's not five o'clock, Clint. - Walter Payton has swum for more yards than any other bass in history, from the big lake about 30 miles away up the river all the way to Jake's Corner. - The river's empty. - That's the thing about it, we found him just in time in a tiny little puddle before the drought sucked the river dry. - [Spence] Wow, that's Walter Payton? Can I feed him? - Yeah, that's one of your jobs, feedin' Walter Payton every mornin'. Go ahead, grab one, throw him in. - [Spence] Did you see that, Uncle Johnny? He got one. - Yeah! - I think he wants another one. - I bet he does, only three a day, though, remember that. Now, put the container under here to keep it out of the sun, okay? - [Spence] Okay. - Now, let's go get some breakfast. We've got a big day of work ahead of us. - Will Walter Payton ever go back to the big lake? - Yeah, someday, but right now, he likes it here with us, and we like him here with us. ♪ Walter Payton wandered in on the desert floor ♪ - Food up on the style spin, rotator ring-ding, Spence. - Rotator ring-ding? - Five number table. - What's five number table? - Wheels has his own language, Spence; follow me. ♪ Time, and when I'm gone, I'm gonna stay ♪ - That was table number five. - Rotator ring-ding, that's what Wheels calls it. - [chuckling] No, forget that. See, I write all the table numbers on my tickets. Table one, it starts in the back corner, counting down from one to 12. - What happened to your arm? - We working, Spence, pay attention. Table number eight needs clearing now. Two pitchers of beer, six glasses! - [Wheels] Get this one up! - Remember, towel in the pocket, dishes first. [dishes clattering] - What the piss-shit! - First pitcher's on us. This is my nephew, Spence, it's his first day. - [Customer] Your nephew, Johnny? - Yeah. - Shit, no disrespect, huh? - No problem. - Sorry, kid, didn't mean to curse up a streak, but it's kind of cold and you got me in an awkward spot. - The ladies, they don't like it when a man wets himself. [all laughing] - Spence, Shoots, Flaps, Stacy and Courtney. They're regulars. - Howdy, Spence. - You're a cutie, darlin'. - [Johnny] Let's get back to it. - Make some room, let's give the kid some work here. - You take the plates, you put them on here. Get the plates, there you go. Okay, let's go. Take your dirty plates, glasses and silverware and put it in the tub here, okay? - Okay. - Go ahead. [dishes clattering] Now take your time, Spence. Don't rush or you're gonna spill it like you just did. Don't grab more'n you can handle. If it takes three or four trips to be safe, take three or four trips, okay? Now go wipe down that table.

He's the little man workin' his butt off over there. His name is Spence; want you to treat him right and put a few coins in his pocket for his hard work. - Don't be stingy, folks.

You don't hurt them, they won't hurt you. Put your hand out and you'll have a new friend. - No. - Spence, go get your tip money. We'll take a drive to Pace and you can buy yourself somethin' for all that hard work you've been doin'. - [Spence] Can I buy something for Rags? - You can buy whatever you want for whoever you want. It's your money, you worked hard for it. - Okay. - He had a dream about the accident last night. Could it be a memory and not a dream? - More than likely, yes. - Hope it's a dream. - He needs to remember so he can choose to forget, John. - Johnny, Fran keeps ringin' me on the phone.

I bought that doll from an artist in Sao Paolo. - [Ricki] Sao Paolo, Brazil? - Is there another Sao Paolo? - That's where I grew up, my father lives there. - Yes, I know. Put the bag here. And sit, I've made some tea. - Let me help you. - Do not need your help. Sit down. On the couch. This time, you listened to Johnny and you came alone. - Dado is a good man. - I said that he was an angry man. He's not a bad man. - He's had a tough life. - So have you. - Dado loves me and I love him. - He's unsure of where he sleeps and [Fran sighs] if you really love him... - You don't know me or Dado. - I know you. I have filled your cup. Now you fill my cup. Would you care for a cookie? - How come you never visit the Corner? - Mm, I'm an old dog and I dislike playing with puppies. Johnny sent you to me. - What do you mean? - What do you mean "what do you mean"? What do you think I mean? - I'm out of here. - Don't leave, okay? Don't, there is a bear out there. [dog barking] Shut the door! Shut the door, shut it! [door bangs] - No, there's not. - [Fran] [sighs] Yes, look, come here. Uh-huh, look, see? - I don't see anything. - [Fran] I'm enjoying your company, sit. - I know why Clint walks with his head down. - Why is that? - So he doesn't step on any lizard or tarantula [speaking in foreign language]. [speaking in foreign language] Orphans. I don't want that, I want this. Is this your team jersey? - Yeah, that's right, Kansas City Chiefs. - There's no number on it. - They put the number on for you. - What's your number? - [Johnny] Maybe you wanna pick your own. - What's your number? - 29. - I'll take this. - All right, take that, come on. - [Ricki] Is that your son? [gentle music] [gentle music] - Every Sunday, Johnny comes to visit me and I make him a grilled cheese sandwich, with a side of ketchup, and every Sunday, he rests his thoughts on my lap. Lately, his thoughts have been restless, and my Sundays have been vacant. - Did something happen to your son? - When loved ones die, we search for their spirits in others. A mother finds her son, a son finds his mother. A brother searches for his sister. - Maybe my time at the Corner is just a rest stop for me. Maybe I need something more. - You need to be needed. One needs your love to melt his anger. The other needs your spirit to lessen his pain. May I? The world put its fangs into you. Cities can suck your soul with no resting place. You got yours, just before it was stolen from you for good. - I thought about my mom. I thought about how sad she would be if something happened to me, so I came back to the Corner, just to be with her. - And look what you found. You don't have to search for a home that you already have here. - [Dado] Uno. - [Spence] Uno? - Uno. - [Spence] Pick up four.

He's with my mom! - [Johnny] Spence? [twangy guitar music] - Spence, what are you doing here? - Eating pancakes. - [Sylvia] Hey, you guys want some pancakes? - You bet! - Sure. - All right, I will help you, Mom. - [Sylvia] Who's ready? - I am. - Dado, how come you sleep outside? - Because there's more room outside. - Why don't you sprinkle some gummy bears on top? - Good idea, bro, I forgot I had 'em. [candies rattling] - Hey, Uncle John. - [Johnny] What's up? - I wrote my mom and dad a letter, can you send it? - Yeah, I'll send it to 'em.

Gus! - What time is it? - I don't know. - [Gus] Day or night? - It's morning, it's light outside. - I'm still staring at my eyelids. - There's a lady on the phone that says there's a bear by her trailer. - [Gus] Don't answer the phone, Spence. - I already answered it, Gus. - How long you gonna wear that jersey? - [Spence] From now on. - She can wait, I'm gettin' dressed. [door rattles] - What did she say? - Same thing she always says. There's a bear outside her trailer. [gentle music] - How come you haven't asked about my mom? - What? - You always ask about my mom and say the same thing over and over again. "Am I your mom's favorite?" And I say, "Besides, me, my dad "and my Uncle Johnny, you're her favorite." - Where's Rags? - Right there. - How come he doesn't have a leash? - He doesn't need one. My mom said you beat up a jerk at one of Uncle Johnny's football games. - Yeah, some slap-dick was tryin' to make her feel uncomfortable, so I made him feel uncomfortable. - What's a slap-dick? - It's a jerk. Hey, don't you repeat that word near your uncle. He'll get upset with me. - A jerk? - No, slap-dick. - Gus, what are you looking for? - I forgot which rock it was that I put the patrol car key under. - That rock you're standing on? - Man, how am I supposed to see that? This is reverse, okay? Now there's the brake, now we put it in low. - How'd you get to become sheriff? - Your uncle gave me a sheriff's badge, yah! [engine rumbling] - [Spence] What if there is a bear? - [Gus] There's not. [knocking] - [Fran] Who is it? - Sheriff. - [Fran] I sense someone else. - Does she sense the bear? - There is no bear. - [Fran] Who's with you? - Spencer, Johnny's nephew. [gentle music] - You have a fresh scar. Johnny doesn't visit me anymore. - He works hard and sleeps late. - He's hiding from me. - We're leaving, Fran. - Gus, you've just arrived. Come in. - In order for us to come in, you have to let us in. - No dogs, they shit on the floor. - He's house-trained. - Does this look like a house to you? - He's trailer-trained, too, Fran. [Fran sighing] [Gus imitates sighing] - Ow. - Shut the door. [dog tags jingling] - There's no bear, Fran. - It's not safe, Gus, close the door. - Close the door, Gus. [door bangs] - Okay, be comfortable, sit. [Gus groans] - Did you see the bear today? - [Fran] Lately, I have seen him every day. - What's he do? - He wanders and wanders around. - No one else has seen him. - Oh, he's there. Some people just don't wanna see him, do they, Gus? - Whatever you say, Fran. - Lianus painted that, Queen Kong. - Lianus painted all the pictures. - Queen Kong? - King Kong's brother. [Fran exhales sharply] - Spence? It was a bad accident, wasn't it, darling? - Give the boy some room, Fran. - Lianus told me all about you. - [Gus] All right, Spence, let's go. - What did he tell you? - Well, he said you're a nice boy and that he is so, so sad. - About what? - About the accident. - Whoa, Fran, that's enough, okay? - I'm okay, everyone's okay. My mom and dad are okay, right, Gus? - Right, Spence. [gentle guitar music] - Spence, how would you like a grilled cheese sandwich with some ketchup? I'm gonna make you one, okay? - No, I don't want one. I don't like that painting. - Artists paint what they see. - It's ugly. All his paintings are ugly! [painting clattering] I hope there is a bear out here and he eats you! - Nice goin', Fran. Spence, get back here! - Why would you take him up there? - I thought he could be my deputy. - What are you, a Saturday morning cartoon? - I screwed up, I know, I'm sorry, bro. - Lianus, have you seen Spence? - No. - Why would you paint a picture of the boy and his dog? That was stupid. - Easy, Gus, easy. - What's he talkin' about? - Don't worry about it. - Spence saw your painting up at Fran's. [intense bluesy guitar music] - [Spence] Your paintings are ugly. - Hi, Spence. Your uncle and Gus are lookin' for you. - Why do you always wear sunglasses? - 'Cause the sun's bright. - How come your paintings never have the sun in them? My mom always has the sun in her paintings. I like them way better than yours. [engine rumbling] [melancholy Old West whistling music] [dude sighs] - Can I get you boys something to drink? - Boys? [scoffs] We'll get it at the bar, sweetheart. Cut out the broker. [dudes laughing] - I would never be your sweetheart, boy. [dudes chuckling] - She likes you a lot. Good going, dude. - Don't take that shit from a foreigner. - Shut up, man. [singing faintly] - Fran didn't mean to upset you. She's just upset with me because I haven't had the time to go up and visit her lately. Now, if you work really hard, this will be yours. A brand-new $100 bill.
