Come on, darling. You can take another step. Okay, step there now. THREE DAYS AGO I'm stepping. You can step again, dear. I'm stepping. Well done, darling. - Just one more step! - Enough, son. Get off. I'm getting off. You finally massaged me, but my back is still cramped. - But dad, you know... - Dad, breakfast is ready. Wait a minute, dear. You mind your brothers. - Goodness... - Kids, come on. We're having breakfast. Come on, dad. Watch out! - Come here, dad. - I just can't break this cramp. Turn around. Let's try it this way. Let's stand back to back. - Namık. - Yes? I'm going to the dealer meeting tomorrow. You'll mind the store. Of course, dad. So, the test tube baby thing didn't work again? Unfortunately, dad. Don't worry. Let's hope for the best. Let's go. - Namık. - Yes? Don't cars that run on gas tubes burn less fuel? Yes? So how come you're burning so much for a test tube baby? I have no idea, dad... But I hope we'll have a baby. We're trying. Trying? I don't need the details! - That's enough. - Sorry, dad. Your brother-in-law is crying. - Go give him his pacifier. - Okay, dad. He's trying! Goodness... Oh... This cramp just won't break! Here you go, brother. - Dad. - Yes? - Dad. - Yes? - Let's try it this way. - What way? Put your hands behind your neck. - Okay. - Put them together. - Namık. - Yes? See, I made two. And with a single shot! Easy! Nuri! Nuri! In the name of Allah... Didn't I tell you not to do that? Don't get angry. - Get out of the way. - It's not good for the baby. God forbid. Get out of my way. Namık. No tubes. All natural gas! And in one shot! Nuri, don't talk like that in front of the kid! Go on, Namık. - Come on, son. - Hold your hands together. - I'm holding. - I'll break it. Come on, son. You can do it. Oh no! - My man! My man! - To hell with you! - My back! My back! - My man... - Dad! - What did you do to him? - My back! My back! - What did you do to him? I broke him in one shot! - My back... - What happened? What's going on? Where are you sneaking to? Darling, you were sleeping so beautifully, I couldn't wake you up. - Really? - Yes. Let's talk about last night. I think we should forget about last night. We were both very drunk. What are you talking about? We were drunk? It's you who was drunk! You came home dead drunk in the morning. Where were you all night? Where were you? Listen, dear... Shut up! You went to the tavern again, didn't you? Tavern? - Tavern... - Shut up! Did you or didn't you? I didn't go to a tavern! We played rummikub in the Ökkeş's café. And we drank a couple of cups after he closed. That's it. That's not what your phone says! Did I leave it in the room? You did. See what the message from "Ökkeş" says. What does it say? "Honey, you were great last night." Is it my fault if I'm great at rummikub? Next message: "You finished me, my man!" We were playing rummikub. I passed a tile to the man next to me. And Ökkeş won. That's what he means. "I already miss you baby." Okay, I confess! - Ökkeş is hitting on me! - What? I swear. He keeps eyeing me all the time. He's my childhood friend. I can't say anything. - I'm waiting for him to lose interest. - You're still lying! God knows which woman's number you saved as "Ökkeş"! - You're blaming me for nothing. - Come on! I have more than enough to blame you for! - Please. - Once you're back from the dealer meeting. - I'll divorce you! - Divorce me? I'll divorce you! I've had enough! Damn you! Get out! Son, please, drive properly. I repent for my sins... What's that? What are you doing there? I keep losing my rosary, so... your prospective father-in-law put this on my phone. I count beads with it. An application. May God accept your deed. How many gigabytes a day does it count? I don't know about the gigabytes. Does it save your good deeds too? There's an app for that too, but my phone can't handle it. - Oh. - Right. Allah is great. Your mother is making up for the morning prayer she missed. Don't turn, she'll lose the Qibla! Don't turn? I'm on the road! How can I drive without turning? - Why did she miss it... - She's late for a gathering. Allah is great. Not just that. She'll buy jewelry for asking the girl's hand too. In the name of Allah... Oh, there's more. She needs to go to the market and get some gifts too. What kind of communication is this? How do you two speak? Son, don't make me mad. Look in front of you! I'm looking. Don't tell me what to do. I've grown up. I can even drive without looking. See? I'm not looking! I'm not looking! - Son, look at the road! - I'm not looking! - Watch out! Watch the road! - I'm not looking! Goodness! We have the fridge at the back. - We promised to deliver it today. - You want to guarantee this, don't you... You're treating me the same way you treat a fridge! I haven't even seen much of her! What kind of marriage is this, in this day and age! As a father, am I at fault for wanting to guarantee a good future for my son? Your prospective father-in-law owns five white goods stores. Five! - Really? - In the name of Allah... - Oh, it's six. - But please! Don't I have to love the girl I marry? - All praise is due to Allah... - No, she says it's not. Mom, what kind of praying is that! That's no way to pray. Don't raise your voice! You'll break her prayer. Goodness... Dad, I don't want this. Hear what you're saying, for God's sake! Dad, I don't want to marry that girl. We owe so much debt to the company that we can't pay. You can pay that with a concordatum. With whom? Concor-who? - What's that? - With a concordatum. There's this thing called concordatum. You do that when you can't pay. - Concor... - Concordatum. It means, "Look, we can't pay this debt. It doesn't seem like we'll be able to. That's clear. What can you do? We can't pay it and that's that. What will you do? Will you grab us by the collar? Will you kill us, you rascals?" Don't say that. See, that's exactly what we need your father-in-law's support for. I'm going to the dealer meeting tomorrow. We'll ask for her hand when I come back. You're getting too hung up about this debt. Don't worry. - Listen to me. - Son, please. - Don't worry, dad. - Watch out! - Did you borrow money... - Grab the wheel! - We'll pay that debt. - Watch it! - Hey, hey! - You're interfering with my principles! Allahu akbar... - Oh God... - Does your back hurt? - Are they for me? - They're for your mom! Come on. I'm coming. I'll leave this and come. - Thank you too. Have a nice day. - Have a nice day. Hello, welcome. I'm Gülçin. I'm the assistant of Mr. Zafer, the head of our company. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Welcome. - I'm Namık Temizkan, the Erzurum dealer. My father-in-law Nuri Durmaz was supposed to come, - but he's ill. I'm replacing him. - I was informed. I wish him the best. - Thank you. - So, now... - Greetings. - Welcome. I'm Adem Ballı, son of Yusuf Ballı, the Konya dealer. My father had a minor traffic accident. I'm here representing the company. I hope he gets well soon. So, now... - Greetings. - Hello. I'm Antep dealer Sadık Çolak. I was going to come, and... I came. So, once again, welcome. Can I have the gentlemen's key card? This is your key card. You're staying in the same room. - Sorry? - But why? What do you mean? One room for the three of us? This year, our slogan is: "Let's unite." That's why we're hosting our dealers in groups of three. But this is no good. Look... We all stay in rooms for three and unite. We're side by side. We intermingle. Mingle... Aren't we going a bit too fast? I'm impatient. This is a disgrace! I'm calling the police. - Sir, please. - Wait! - Brother... - Wait... - You don't have to do this. - Hello. Police? I'd like to file a complaint about a lady. - Brother... - Shut up! Yes, she's standing right in front of me. What did she do? She shot me right in my heart! Sir, please stop this! But I'm losing a lot of blood! By the way, we have the opening of Mr. Zafer's exhibition this afternoon. We have shuttles outside. Everyone is invited. I'm not feeling well. Perhaps we should call an ambulance. Enough already. But what was our slogan? "Let's unite." It's a shame. You don't even give me your number. I brought some food from my home town. I'll treat you to it. Thank you, but I don't like pickles. I didn't say I brought pickles. I was talking about your smell! Have a nice day. That's what she said... - I like it. - What? Pickles. Cucumber, cabbage... My mother makes it. Mango. What's going on? Why did you bring me here? Now, tell me. Why did you let them shoot me? - Shoot you? - You let them shoot me from behind, and ran away without a trace! I swear I didn't do that! You've mistaken me for someone else. - I have nothing to do with this! - Shut up! Are you saying I'm lying? Are you? Am I lying? Am I lying, Şahin? Am I lying? Isn't your username Spider Lütfü 42? I guess you're talking about the game, sir. My nickname is KissYourLips_92. - Show me your nickname! - Let me show you. Here. Idiot! Why didn't you check his nickname before you brought him? You're useless, Şahin! Take him away! And find me that Spider Lütfü 42! Yes, Mr. Demircan. Here, sir. This is your room. Come in. - Greetings. - Welcome. Nice room. But there are two beds here. So, I'm getting this one. Of course not, sir. We have an extra folding bed in this room. See... Oh, good. I'm getting that, then. Oh, no! Sir, be careful! - I'm opening it, sir! - What's going on? - I'm here. - Are you alright, sir? I'm fine. I just wanted to see how it worked. Goodness! This guy is crazy... Okay, we'll handle things from here. You stay... There you go. Take this. Sultan of Brunei! Have a nice holiday, sir. - Thanks. - Thank you, brother. See how happy he was to grab the five liras? Oh, man... Let's get going, Sadık... So, young men. - You’re new in here? - Sorry? Is this your first time at the dealer meeting? It's my first time. Mine too. In fact, my father was supposed to come. Yusuf Ballı. From Ballı Merchants, Konya. - We know that. - He broke his foot in an accident, so... - You told us that downstairs. - Right, the accident. What was I saying? Right. I'd gotten the red card from my lady. She hasn't let me go anywhere for five years. But I travelled a lot back in the day. You're lying. Where did you go? Of course I did. I travelled all over the country. And abroad... I went to the Ukraine the most. He said Ukraine! - Fifteen times. - Ukraine! He said Ukraine! I've got more Ukraine stamps on my passport... than Shevchenko! No way. You're exaggerating. But it's a matter of dispute who the greater scorer is! Click! - See? - Oh, what a guy! What a guy! Oh man... Oh God... The bellboy didn't lock it... Be careful, man. Okay, I’m not good in bed. That’s understood. Not good in bed... - I'm really not good. - What a maniac! - I'll teach you! - Teach me. - Let's freshen up and see the hotel. - Let's go. He made it his nest! - Greetings. - Greetings. Here we are. We're really tired. - Hello, brother. - Wow! - Shall I blow-dry those? - Sadık, please... Oh, he's gone... - The Turkish bath was great, rafik. - Right. "Rafik"? It means "friend" in my home town. - Like "dude." - "Bro." - "Partner." - Like that. - Namık! - Şahin! So it was really you at the reception! It really was you! My brother! That's my brother! Şahin is a friend of mine from the orphanage. We grew up together. Really? - This is Sadık. - Sadık. - Adem. - Adem Ballı. From Konya. Nice to meet you. So, you two were raised in an orphanage? We were. That's great. In our country... we don't have many educated people like you. In Europe, at least... In Scandinavia... You don't know what you're talking about. - Sweden, Norway... - So, what are you doing here? We're here for the dealer meeting. And what are you doing here? I work for this company! - No way! - I don't mean to interrupt, but... I'm too tired. I'll go to my room and take a rest. I'll see you in the opening. - Okay. - Namık, I'm in the room. Okay. Have a nice rest. Let's go and take a steam bath. It's good for the lungs. And we'll catch up after all these years. Well said, brother. Adem, come on. I shouldn't bother you. Perhaps you have some catching up to do... So, I'll see you in the room. Let's go. My brother, Namık! That's my brother... I thought you'd insist just a bit... Sadık... I don't think this heat is good for me. You'll see at night how good it is for you. Just wait until you see it. You know what this is? - What's that? - Look at it. You have to get close. I've missed you, man. Has it been ten years? It must have been. I made a friend from Erzurum during military service. I moved to Erzurum. Things worked out. I got married. I now work in my father-in-law's white goods store. So you married into the business! That's kind of what happened. Brother. You're not angry with me for never calling you, are you? Of course I'm not. We really went astray those days anyway. It was terrible. - Theft, and... - Shh! Be quiet! Let's not disgrace ourselves. - You're right. - May God forgive us. We were on the streets. We had no choice. I'm glad we quit that work. Both you and me. I told nothing to my wife and her family. I made a new start, with a clean slate. I did the same, man. I'm now Mr. Demircan's driver. - I thank God. I work to earn my bread. - Well done. - How long will you be staying? - Three days. For the dealer meeting. - Good. - I'm suffocating here. I should go. There's an opening or something. I'll go there with the folks anyway. That's nonsense, man. Anyway, suit yourself. Please, stop that! - Namık. - Yes? Listen. We're running this whole show here. So tell me, do you need anything? - No, thank you, brother. - If you need anything, don't hesitate. No, thank you. God bless you. We grew up together. I know you. Tell me, whatever it is. Well, you said you were Mr. Demircan's driver, right? - Yes? - Well... We owe a lot of debt to the company. Can you help me meet Mr. Demircan? Perhaps we can talk about restructuring our debt... That's all you want from me? Rest assured. I've got that. That's great, brother. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm off, then. - Okay. I'll stay some more. - I'll see you there. - Okay. Wait, what's that there? - What is it? - What's that! - Brother, please! - What's that thing! - It's the heat! I swear, it's the heat! It's the heat... - Namık, you go now. - See you, brother. Distinguished members of the press and esteemed guests, welcome. Our purpose in opening such an exhibition in this dealer meeting... is to show the long-established roots of the Yurdaeroğlu family. The exhibition includes many artefacts... of great moral and material value, and the most valuable among them... is a pocket watch, a heirloom from my late great-grandfather. Currently, this watch is worth a million dollars. Once again, welcome. Enjoy the exhibition. Sorry... Sorry... Could you please come with me? What's going on? Hello everyone. I'm Övgü Maral, self-improvement expert. For three days, we'll be doing a lot of self-improvement together. Let's see, what's your name? I'm Adem Ballı. From Ballı Merchants, Konya. - My father... - Enough. Look at Mr. Adem. What kind of a person do you think he is? Simple. Mild-mannered. - A gentleman. - An idiot. - Idiot. - He may be simple, mild-mannered. He may be an idiot. But rest assured. After three days, Mr. Adem will be a different man. Not only him, but you too will all improve. With my method, you will all be new people. With Övgü, you will improve. We thank Ms. Övgü very much. Thank you, Mr. Adem. Thanks. I should ask the members of the press to leave now... Dear guests, it's time to see our exhibition. Can I have that photo later? Mr. Zafer, this way. - Come on. - I don't want to see it. - They've put so much effort in this. - I don't care! Come on. We should go to a tavern. For you to get cultured. Wow. This is a nice place. - Sadık, it's a beautiful place, isn't it? - Yes. Beautiful. - How did they make that? - How did they... Sorry. I'll be right back. Adem, isn't it great? Adem. Adem. Adem. What's going on? - What? - What's going on? I touched a girl's hand for the first time in my life! Really? How did you feel? You know that scene in Titanic, - where the ferry sinks... - And? After it sinks, as Jack goes down... on that board, he holds the girl's hand... The last romantic. Is that how you felt? Not exactly like that... Go and wash your face. That may not be enough. Hello? Şule? Wait, I'm in a noisy place. Let me go over there. Nobody move! This is a robbery! Get over there! What's going on? Wait a minute! What's going on here? Go! Get down! Lie down! Lie down! What are you doing! - Nobody can touch our family heirlooms! - Shut up! You are not a bad person. You've just had a bad childhood. Put that gun down. - Come, let's talk. - Shut up! If she keeps talking, I'll shoot her! No! He doesn't want to hit me now. He wants to hug me. - Come here. Let's hug. - Enough! Everyone, stay calm! We'll take that watch and get out! No heroics, or I'll shoot you! He said "the watch"... Hey! Hey! What did you do! - What did you do! - What did I do? To hell with you! What did you do! Hey! Easy. Easy. Stay away! Don't come! Step back! - Step back, or I'll shoot you! - Nobody will be hurt! You won't be hurt either. Don't make me shoot you! Go back! Don't make me kill you! Stop! Get down! Sadık, take the gun! Adem, you take that one. I'm fine here. Goodness... That was some trouble we got in there. My heart is still racing. - It was a close call, I swear. - Right. Namık, had it not been for you, we'd have been in big trouble. The way you came out of nowhere... and grabbed the gun from that guy... Right. That was great work. Just like James Bond... ish. I did what I could to save our lives. But you really should've stayed out of it. - What if you were hurt? - You're right. It's all because of Sadık. You said, "Let's get in there and smash the statue on the guy's head!" - Me? - Yes. It was just an idea. You could've persuaded me not to go. If you asked not to go, we wouldn't have gone. What's he talking about? Goodness... Why don't you eat from your own plate? - What? - Why don't you eat from your own plate? I have no appetite. Thank you. I have a bad stomach. I don't feel like eating tonight. We'd like to welcome all our dealers from all over Turkey... to our dealer meeting. This year, we come together, and unite. - If only... - Hey... And now, our deputy general manager... Mr. Demircan Yurdaeroğlu. Everyone, let's sing our company anthem together! Where is he? Where's the sound coming from? Let's unite with our dealers And get together in this place Let's have a night of fun In Istanbul, Antalya, Ukraine and Russia Let's go crazy Among all the dealers, I've chosen you I've given you this title Now your tasks is to Sell all the white goods Overcharge the customers And rip them off He worked on that. Well done, manager! Thank you. Thank you. Before we get started, I'd like to thank once again before you our brave dealers who protected us at the exhibition today. Had it not been for them, we might not be here now. - No, don't mention it. - Stand up, stand up! Wouldn't you do the same thing if you were in our place? No. Applause! But don't worry. Your good deeds will not go unrewarded. - There's no need for that. - Wait. He's saying something. Wait and listen, Namık. So, I'm awarding to our three dealers... What's that? Oh God... You're in luck today... - A mixer! - Damn that mixer! - Does he mean a blender? - They both mix. He got all mixed up... And now, self-improvement expert Övgü Maral! It's her! It's Ms. Övgü! - Yes. - The self-improver! - Look at that guy... - Thank you. Gülçin is a friend of mine... - Yalçın, where are you going? - From university. Thank you, Gülçin. So, I'd like to have one of you on the stage tonight. Whoever the ball in my hand goes to... it will be my destiny to be with him on the stage tonight. - You want to go on stage? - Oh, no. Not for me. - Really? You're itching for it! - No, I'm not made for this kind of thing - Are we ready? - So you won't go if it hits you? No, that's unfair. Whoever gets the ball goes. - Are you excited? - Whoever gets it. I see hands in the back. It would be unfair. Really. - Here comes the ball. - It's coming! - Whoever gets it. I'm fine. - I'm throwing it! I won't be unfair. I don't mind this. Okay, I've got it! I've got it! I've got the ball! Let go! What do you need self-improvement for? Tense moments at the dealer meeting... - You don't need this! - Perhaps you should calm down... They're both so eager... - You're embarrassing the man. - Let go! Let go! I got it! I got it! - I got it. It's part of my destiny! - Applause! - It's destiny. - Mr. Adem, right? Let's have Mr. Adem on stage. - Sorry, brother. - Fevzi, sorry... - The young man is... - Let's go to the center of the stage. So, Mr. Adem got the ball. He's our energy ball tonight! You're a big ball, Adem! Look at that ball... - Baldy! - Mr. Adem, please look at me. I'm starting. Music please. I sometimes... go to the zoo. To lament and cry for the captive animals there. One of those sad days... having cried my heart out... I stopped in front of a kangaroo cage. Would you be a kangaroo for me? A kangaroo? Well, I've been Little Rabbit before. In grade school spelling bees, particularly. But I have no experience with the kangaroo. "No experience!" Like he'll be a staff kangaroo! Mr. Adem, I can see that potential in you. You have the capacity to be a tiger, or a bull, if necessary. - Look at that tiger! - But right now, I need a kangaroo. Would you be a kangaroo for me? - I will. - He will! Bravo, Adem! And that day, that sad day... I walked up to the kangaroo. There was nothing between us but the wire fence. Our eyes met. He seemed to understand that I was sad. He started making little jumps as if trying to make me happy. Something seemed to attract me to him. I started jumping along with him. Tears of joy filled both of our eyes. We were so happy. We were jumping so high, we almost touched the sky. And that moment, I understood... that if we want to, we can get rid of all our problems and troubles. - Shall I stop now? - That being happy was so easy. - Can I stop? - Keep jumping, Mr. Adem. Since then, whenever I feel bad... I use the Jumpy Method. Now, I invite everyone... to stand up. - Everyone... - We should stand up. - Jump like a happy kangaroo! - Get up. We're supposed to jump. Jump, and you'll see how beautiful life is! With feeling! Come on! I see people not jumping! Tell your friend to jump! Folks, jump! We're getting yelled at here. Make contact with your peer. Give them your energy. Smile at them. Hug them. - Fethi, come here. - Jump and hug! Have you ever seen a sad kangaroo? I've drawn Real Madrid here! It's unfair! Put them in your pouch! - But... - Jump! - Oh! - Jump! Everyone, jump! This sweat... this wetness... This smell... I'm getting drowsy... - He fainted! - Brother! - Sadık fainted! - Sadık fainted! Keep it up! - Sadık, are you alright? - The back row! - Brother, stand up. - He fainted of happiness! There's a lesson to be learned here... - Have we arrived? - Give him water. - Give him water. - Water. I can't drink water. Hold on, brother. I want to see the hands of our brave dealers in the air! Dance! Open, open! Open your arms, I'm coming I'm coming, don't be mad I will kiss your lips I will kiss them, don't complain Open your arms, I'm coming I'm coming, don't be mad I will kiss your lips I will kiss them, don't complain Rom-pom-pom pom-pom rom-pom-pom Thank you. We were having fun inside. That girl was blowing kisses. Please... - The heroes... - Yes, brother? Our boss thinks the reward wasn't enough. He wants to give you another gift. If it's a food processor, I don't want one! Of course not, bro. Who cares about that? We have a very nice restaurant nearby. He'd like to host you there. Hey, I'm taking you partying! Partying? Mr. Demircan might be there too. - You'll talk about the debt. - The debt? I'm going to talk to Mr. Demircan about... whether we can restructure our debt to the company... I need that very much too. Well, on behalf of Ballı Merchants of Konya... I too can talk to Mr. Demircan about that. I will. Okay, so let's go. We'll hang out a bit and come back. We'll see about that. - Let's go. - Come on. Ms. Övgü must be there, right? This kangaroo is still trying to jump! Of course I am. Tonight... Okay, just a second... - I thought you finished. - We'll talk later. So? I'm saying all this, but... When I left the orphanage, my father-in-law protected me. He's more like a real father to me. I didn't know that, of course. I guess I'm too hung up about this baby matter. Do you want some brotherly advice? I have a child. Yes, it's a great feeling. And it's a lot of fun to make! But you have to have the peace of mind to do it. - Tonight - Shut up. - I stopped by every tavern... - Slow down. - You said you didn't drink alcohol? - I don't. What did you drink? Just two. I just took two tranquilizers. My mother gave them to me. For the plane trip. When there was that "invitacy" between me and Ms. Övgü... - Intiva... - Intimacy. - Intimacy. - Right. When we had an intimate moment, I dropped two of those in the toilet. - You dropped pills? - He said "pills!" Tranquilizers, to calm me down. But they weren't enough to calm me down! Wait, I'll shoot this on video. - Shoot it. - I'll shoot it. - I'm starting. - Sing it. Tonight, I stopped by every tavern... Wait, wait. I got a message from my wife. She's crazy for me. Every tavern in Istanbul. What happened? She says she gave power of attorney to her lawyer. She's divorcing me. Really? I'm sorry, brother. They married us... too early. I did come to love my wife with time... but I couldn't live my youth. That's not an excuse, but... I made many mistakes. She's right. I can't blame her. Don't be sad, brother. Come on, start the song now. - Come on. - No, you go on. You talk. - What is it? - You talk. Are you crying? They're marrying me at this young age too. - It's alright. - He's so horny, he's crying of happiness! Come on, what happiness... Don't I deserve to marry someone I love? Can't I marry someone like Ms. Övgü? Can't I be a happy kangaroo? Don't be sad. How can I not be sad... I'll end up just like Sadık! God forbid. Look at him. Look at that face. What's wrong with me? - Why are you laughing? - Of course I'm not. I didn't mean to. Look at him. Please, brother. You're a fine man. I didn't laugh at you. Of course you are. Nothing's wrong with you. I was being silly. Okay, stop laughing. - Namık, he's laughing at me! - Calm down. - This guy is younger than me. - "Peace of mind..." Okay, calm down. Adem! Adem! You're disgracing yourself. I'm sorry, brother. Give me your blessings. You're my elder. This guy is flying! I raise a toast, with my coke... to my esteemed elders who are with me here tonight. - Come on. - Namık. That's it. And of course Sadık. I'm sorry. Give me your blessings. - Be blessed. - You know that I love you. I love you... Oh no... Get up! Get up! I'm alright. I've seen worse. - Are you alright? - I'm fine. God. I'm sorry if I broke... Your heart. What's going on? Sorry, brother. We'll pay for the table. - Right. - It's nothing, man. Never mind. Let's say it was the evil eye. I don't think this guy has much of an evil eye... Thank you for everything, brother. We made a bit of a mess. Sorry about that. - Really. - We couldn't see Mr. Demircan, but we're here for two more days. We'll see him. Of course you will. You'll have a lot more time to see us all. None of you are going anywhere. What do you mean? You're all my guests here. Oh, no, please. We've eaten enough. Thank you. God bless you. You've done a lot for us. We shouldn't overstay our welcome. Oh, we'll find something to make you eat! You're serious. Very. Huh? What's going on? Who do you think you're kidnapping? I'm from Antep! I'll give you trouble! I'm a psychopath! Sadık! He first put Sadık on silent, and then on vibrate... Namık, I'll bring help. Adem! Adem! Namık, I don't think I can bring help. I probably can't. There's 95 percent chance I can't. Catch him! Stop! Stop! Stay away! Stay away! Hey, stay away! No! Sir, are you alright? I'm fine. Call the police! - What happened there? - Nothing. - Call for help. I'm fine. - Sir, are you okay? - You're sure? - I am. I'm really fine. If you're fine, look what you did to my sunroof! You messed it up, you idiot! You messed it up! I'm not that fine! Don't hit me! I'll pay for it. I promise! Of course you will, you freak! We got from "sir" to "freak" so fast! Let him go! Alright! There's not much damage anyway. Are you alright, sir? Hello... Hello! Oh God... What's going on? Why did you tie us up? Why are we tied up? Is this some kind of perverse fantasy? What is this? Don't you do some weird things to us! What will you do with that iron bar? What? You hung them upright! Why am I upside down? You kept saying women's names in your sleep. All the blood was rushing down there. We thought we'd turn it around. But there's something you didn't think of. I've got a strong punch! Come on, get up! Namık, what are you after? Let me go! - I'm trying to help. - Okay, okay. It's not going to work. No. Hang him upright. Thank you. Thank you. Now that I'm untied... can I go to the bathroom? - Don't mess with us! - It always happens when I'm nervous! Şahin, whatever you want, ask it of me. Let my friends go. No. This is all of your problem now. Brother, I guess I had a wet dream when I fainted. What? I had a nocturnal emission. If you'll kill me, I need to take an ablution before! It will be your sin otherwise! This wet dream is all of our problem now! Mr. Şahin, please don't kill me. I didn't hear or see anything. - I have latent diabetes. - He really does. I get this temporary blindness. Look, here it comes again! I see nobody now. Thank God, it came back again... Şahin, don’t hurt us! Forgive us, for our children and families! - You don't have children. - Stop vexing me with that now! - I will have kids. I'm working on it! - Please, I didn't mean that. Shut up! What are you people talking about? You messed up the plan we've been hatching for three months! The plan? What the hell were you doing in that exhibition? - You think it's your place to be heroes? - What do you want from us? Here, sir. Idiot! What are these? Debt notes. The notes for the debt you owe us. If you don't do as I say... your mothers, fathers, fathers-in-law... - wives... - Come on. All your relatives... will rot in prison! Good. It didn't end too bad. It could've been worse. Şahin, what do you want from us? Say it. You’ll bring me that pocket watch we couldn’t steal that day! - You want us to steal it? - Steal it, snitch it, take it... I don't care what you do! Just bring it to me! Oh, no. I'm out. I'm out. My parents would rather rot in prison than see me stealing. I'm out. Thank you. - I'm really out. - Do you think your parents would like to see you dead, Rambo? They wouldn't. What a silly question. So do what I tell you! And don't you tell anything to the police, or anybody else. You can't prove anything, and you'll put yourself in big trouble. You have two days. Are you crazy? How can we steal? Don't worry. We'll give you directions when the time comes. And Namık will tell you the rest. Untie them. Take this. What is it that you will tell us? I don't know. That rascal is making fun of us! Now that I'm nervous, it just won't stop! What shall we do? How do we get the watch? Here's how... You know, we didn't eat since last night. My stomach is empty. - Right. - Brother... Let's grab the watch when the place is empty at night. Those guys would've done so if there hadn't been a good alarm. - You're right. - You know what we should do? - Go grab something from the minibar? - No. This is not the time for that. I have to listen to the plan. Tell me. So listen. Here's what we do. That stomach isn't rumbling. It's trying to tell us something... - I'll grab something. Okay? - Go. - I'll have a snack. - Get me something too. I'm hungry. Do your feet hurt? Yes. I was hung from the ceiling last night, you know! - Here. - Thank you. - Have some. - I won't. - Have it. - I won't! I guess storming the place like those guys and taking the watch is our only chance. Are you crazy? How can guys like us do a robbery like that? No stealing. I can't do it. It's a sin. What would I do in the afterlife? I'm not saying I love to do it! Here's what we'll do. Let's go and scout out the place. Then we'll make some preparations. Scout out? Preparation? How can we ever do this? Okay, we can't go to the police. We have no proof. At least let's go and report that rascal to his boss, Mr. Demircan. - Let's try our luck. - Of course. Why are you eating mine? You got the spiced ones. Mine aren't spiced. I like these better. - Give me your blessings. - Be blessed. - You eat these. - No. - Take it. - No. Shh! Okay, calm down. Okay, okay. Wait! I have a great idea. - Hello? - Hello, reception? Reception, sir? I brought some food from my home town. I'd like to give it to Mr. Demircan. What was his room number? We can't share his room number, sir. But he's in the gym right now. - Really? Okay, thank you. - Have a good day. Mr. Demircan is in the gym! - Good. - Oh, great. He's in the gym! Let's go! Come on, let's go! Come on. - Right, right! - Come on! To hell with your peanuts! You'll lose that weight! No shrinking the stomach! - No! - Faster! I'll lose that weight! I'm not having my stomach shrunk! Good! Good! Mr. Demircan! Mr. Demircan! Oh, the heroes. Welcome. I've never seen dealers work out at the gym before. We're not here to work out, - but to tell you something. - Oh, you came to tell me something. Don't talk to me. You can talk straight to Şahin instead. Şahin? Now we're dead! Can you excuse us for a minute? - What's going on? - I knew I couldn't trust you! Didn't I tell you not to talk to anyone? Get in there! - Where? - On the treadmills! Oh, please. We don't have workout clothes. We shouldn't bother you. - Get in there! - I'll go on that. Get on! Get on. Perhaps it will be good for your little brains! I ate spiced peanuts. If I work out now, it will give me heartburn. Go! We said something there... Idiots! You messed up the plan I've been hatching for three months! Mr. Demircan, please don't get us into this. - We can't do a robbery! - Yes. Oh, you can't? - No. - No. We're really not made for it. I think you should think again. Şahin! I asked a friend from Erzurum to stop by your store. No! I have friends everywhere. Including Konya and Antep. If you do us wrong, they will visit your stores too! Don't you touch my family! Do you people know who I am? Hey! But Mr. Demircan, why would you rob your own father? This makes no sense to me. What do you care, idiot? He's my father! Right. You'll get this thing done right away. Or I'll give you trouble. Idiots. Let's go. You'll get this done, one way or another! - Namık... - I can't go on. I'm letting go. - Wait. - Let me go. I'm letting go. Wait! Dude? What are you doing, dude? There's a button. You press it and it stops. - Where? - That red one. I was wondering what that was... Let's go. Is it Mr. Necati? You answer. Yes... Yes, brother. Yes. Sure. A gambling debt is a debt of honor. Don't worry. By tomorrow at the latest... You'll get it tomorrow night. I'm in an elevator now. I can't hear you. I may be losing signal... My midwife? I was born in a private hospital. He was a gynecologist. You don't mind the title... All the way up to the chief physician... Right... But... It's dropped. Şahin, these men aren't kidding. We need to get this done by tomorrow night. If we can't pay the gambling debt, these guys won't let us live! Rest assured, sir. Don't you worry. We'll get this done swiftly, - like a hot knife through butter. - Good. Because the call dropped but that guy said some terrible things about my gynecologist. - They're not joking. - Right. Any news from Spider Lütfü 42? No, sir. We haven't caught him yet. Sadık! Come here. Goodness... - Sadık. There's no watch. - No watch. - Let's take some photos, okay? - Okay. - Let's take photos and take a look around. - Okay. 34-97. Come to the fourth register please. Rafik, what do you say? - Don't be silly. Leave that. - What? Leave that. It looks like the real thing. Yes. - I think it's good. - Very good. We won't pull the trigger. Get three. - Are you sure? - Just get three. Let's go. - There's only three of these. - So get them. It says "Buy three, get one for free." - Never mind. - But there's no fourth. - Who cares? - But we're entitled! Namık! - What's that? - A radio. - What for? - We need it to communicate. No need. We'll start a WhatsApp group. Right. And we'll name the group "robbery"! - Right. - No way! We'll use this. But we can't use our real names. We need nicknames. Mine will be Edip. It's my late grandmother's name. We lost her last year. - God rest her soul. - Thank you. Our nicknames can't be related to us. Our identities would be revealed. - We need random names. - Adriana Lima! - Not that random. - Namık, listen. I'll be Namık. You'll be Sadık. And Sadık will be Adem. To create confusion. You like the idea? That's not an idea. It's nothing. Shh! - Arnold Schwarzenegger! - No way. - Just Schwarzenegger? - No way! - Schwarz! - Alright! - Everyone gets their favorite color. - I'll take lilac. - Lilac? - It was my grandmother's favorite color. She was a real Libra woman. Unpredictable and rebellious! Lilac was my color. - What? - I got lilac. No, I'm lilac. Okay, I'll take fuchsia. Fuchsia is fine. - I'm alright with fuchsia. It's fine. - Get any color you want. I'm cyclamen. - Do we have the masks? - I've got the masks. Alright. Let's go to the cash point. - Sadık... - Come on. - Can I have lilac? - I told you, it was her favorite color. - Why did you get all this stuff? - What? - Why all this stuff? - I got random things, as a cover-up. - Well done. - You didn't have to. A tea tray. Tea... - Sorry. - Go on. Brilliantine. For our hair. Windshield wipers. Windshield... Okay, put them in. They make these things so nice. They look just like me! One moment, boy. You have a difficult job, with all that "beep", "beep", "beep"... It's like watching a censored TV show, right? - You're right, sir. - Sir... When did I get old enough to be called "sir"? - Come on. - I don't care what she says. I can't read the barcode for the Oldie adult diapers. - Can you get another one? - What? I can't read the barcode for the Oldie adult diapers. - Can you get another one? - I can't hear you. I can't read the barcode for the adult diapers! Can you get me another? The gentleman is waiting here. - Gentleman... - Diapers! - Hurry! - Okay. Sir, you got the best one, though. My father has the same problem. He uses these too. He wets himself all night, but he stays dry. What are you talking about? That's not mine! Is it yours? Whose is it? Oh, you're stocking them in advance. You're doing right. These things will get expensive in no time. You'll probably be wetting all over the bed in a few years anyway. I don't wet myself! Look, I'm dry! - What are you doing! - She said I wet myself! Okay, quiet! It's alright. They act like kids when they get old! Get old... Why did you have to get that! - What! Come on. - Quiet! - It's a cover-up. - We drew enough attention! - Let's get out. - Wait a second. The 10000th customers of our supermarket are here! - What? - Congratulations! You're the 10000th! - Us? - Yes. What's going on? Put your hands down! Come on, let's enjoy this! We deserve it. A mixer again! - At least we actually got them this time. - Come on. - I don't know what to say to you... - Why are you telling me? - Why did you have to get adult diapers? - I didn't get them! - So who got them? - No. Goodness... No other woman is like my wife... - Right. - She loves me for who I am. - Of course. - I'm quitting! - I'm swearing off other women. - Well done! - There. - That's right. I'm deleting my whole contact list. Don't go that far. You're rushing. - I deleted them all. Done. - Really... I'm swearing off it. I quit. - Brother... - No, no, my eyes just happened to... Are you testing my patience or what? I said I quit! - Brother... - Sadık... - The car is here. - Huh? Let's get in. Open the door. Open it. - Take these. - What are those? We've left a blue car on the back street for you to escape in after the robbery. You'll find a map inside. You'll go to the location marked on it and make the delivery. Discard your phones after the operation. We'll communicate with this. Our boys will get you guns too. - What? - We don't want any guns. - What about the security cameras? - Don't worry. We've got that. You're running out of time. Get this done tomorrow. Or you're in trouble. Get out of here! We were getting out. Did he have to bump? No. Namık, what shall we do? Let's go to the room and go over the plan again. Come on. Do we really have to break the phones? Shut up for a second! I can't break mine. It's 20 megapixels! Okay, I'm free. - Yes, I'm free. - Okay. Good evening. Good evening, Ms. Övgü. Good evening. Good evening. - You can go, dear. - Okay. - Mr. Adem. - Yes, Ms. Övgü. I haven't seen you around today. We needed to get a few things. Wipers and so on. I looked for you yesterday. You left in a hurry. I was going to thank you. - In fact, I was going to thank you. - Why? I thanked you in front of the dealers, but you really saved my life. Well, that's right. Who would save another's life for free these days, right? Right? On the other hand, your trust in me was really... you know, I was Little Rabbit. I believe it's you who deserves thanks, for... taking me all the way up from there to being a kangaroo. But it fit you really well. I mean it. - Being a kangaroo. - You really carried that so well. - Well, who taught me? Who taught me? - Övgü Maral. That's what we call a brand, right? Thanks a lot. God bless you, Ms. Övgü. - Thanks. So, goodbye. - Ms. Övgü! I'm well aware of this... Progress I've made... since yesterday. Then I thought, as Ballı Merchants of Konya... perhaps we can, on a corporate basis, regarding the personal... perhaps self-improvement... - You want to hire me. - Right. But on a corporate basis. In corporate terms. Don't misunderstand me. - Here, please take this... - Good. - I have a special discount for dealers. - Um... - Here are some for your friends. - Thank you very much. "Övgü Maral." That must be your assistant's number. - It's my personal number. - Oh, good. So I'll... There's your address. - I have a home office. - Okay. So I'll pass this on to the relevant department, public relations and corporate... - So, thank you. - See you. When? Around. See you around. Oh, okay. Have a nice day. Then we exit through here. Do you understand the plan? Brother... Well... This... This is such a... such a silly... What a terrible, awful thing this is! What kind of a sketch is that? This is a disgrace! What grade did you get in high school art class? Who cares about art? Did you understand the plan or not? - Is this a butterfly? - What's that got to do with it? - That's a cow there. - Oh. Those are the security guards with their hands up! I told you, we gather them in one place. Aren't you listening to me? We're listening, but we don't understand! God, I'm going crazy. How did we ever get in this trouble... Don't blame me again. I hadn't seen Şahin for ten years. I had no idea he turned into this guy! So, wasn't he like this before? He did things like this, but not this much. You hatched a plan in no time, by the way. Are you implying something? No, I'm not implying anything. If you're not, brother I'll call my family now. Is this me? Yes. - This is Sadık? - Yes. - This is me? - Yes. Why? What is it? Is there something you don't understand? Why did you draw us the same height? - It's just a drawing! - I'm not the same height as him! - What's with my height? - Not much. That's what I said. I played basketball for ten years. Ten years! Was it all for this? I'm sorry, brother. You put some work in that. I appreciate the effort. Well done. Please don't resent me. But this drawing is a disgrace! I'm sorry, you're my elder. Give me your blessings. Goodness... What on earth is this guy talking about... - Right. - He drew me completely bald. Am I that bald? How bald are you? Not that bald! That's not who I am, Namık! Goodness... Namık, enough. It's all going over my head now. Don't worry. We'll get through this. Let's go to bed. We have to get up early tomorrow. - Rafik... - What? - How are we going to do this... - Really... I told you, we'll find a way. Let's get a good night's sleep. Come on. Good night. Good night, brother. Good night. - Can we turn off the lights? - Okay. - You! - I was coming to see you. We have to talk. Tell me. Leave Sadık and Adem out of this. - Let me do this on my own. - They got into this the day they ruined my plans. No. You'll do it together. Şahin, why are you... - Greetings. - Hello. - Have a nice day. - Have a nice day. Şahin, why are you doing this? You said you chose a straight life. - You said you were glad to be honest. - Shut up! You made it, of course. You started a family. You left me all alone out there! Weren't we brothers until the end? Didn't we say we had nobody else in life? You were my family! You were on the wrong path, man. Don't you believe I'd have walked with you otherwise? We were orphans! They didn't let us make our own way! Look, Şahin... Please... - Hello. - Hello. - Have a nice day. - Have a nice day. Şahin, if you have the slightest bit of humanity in you leave them out of this and deal with me. No. No way. You'll do this together. And both ways, I win. If you manage to steal the watch despite those two idiots, that's my achievement. And if you get caught... then my anger with you will subside, if only a bit. This conversation is over. - Hello. - Hello, Yalçın. - How are you doing? - Fine, and you? Fine. You disappeared last night. Where were you? I was with a woman. - May Allah accept your prayer. - Thanks. Where have you been? With Şahin, right? You're in this too, man! Come on, tell us. I won't let you ruin our lives too! - But listen... - Say it, man. Confess. Okay, I was with Şahin. - There! - Man! There you go... There you go... There you go. Say it. I should've understood... you were in this when Şahin said, "Namık will tell you the rest." How stupid of me! Oh, brother... Come on, man. Just say it, confess. You can do that. Maybe you had to do it. Say it. Say, "I'm a thief, a dishonest and a dishonorable man." Say, "I'm a thief." Say, "I'm a thief!" When Şahin and I left the orphanage, we were on the streets. We had no family. We were starving. We had no choice but get into dirty work. I regretted it. I chose to quit, but Şahin didn't. Then I did my military service. I swore off it. I made a clean start. - I hadn't seen Şahin since. - Why are you telling us this now? I'm ashamed. You understand? I'm so ashamed. I couldn't even tell my own wife about my past. I don't believe you, man. I don't trust you. I'm not doing no robbery. If they'll kill me, so be it. Here I am. I've had enough, Namık. An ex-thief who can't stop lying... - Right. - And a dimwitted, imbecile man-child! There was no way this would've worked anyway. You know, I'm out too. I'm out. What's this got to do with me? I kept calling you "brother"... But it looks like you're a worthless man. I'm sorry. Give me your blessings. Look at that guy's face, for God's sake! He cheated on his wife a many times, with that tiny height of his! A disreputable man, with no decency or honor! Sorry, bro. - Give me your blessings. - Be blessed. But he's not a man to be trusted! He's worthless. I'm out, man. Excuse me. Please don't resent me. I'm out. I talked to Şahin already. I persuaded him. - Oh. - I'm going in on my own. - You get out of here without being seen. - You're going alone? Yes. Forgive me for lying to you. And give me your blessings. Goodbye. Hello, Şule? I've been thinking about you. Are things alright there? Are you okay? - I'm alright. How are you? - I'm the same... Sweetheart, there are things about my past that I haven't told you. Namık, whatever it is you'll tell me, I'm sure you had a reason. I've seen your heart, Namık. I loved you for everything you were. If we're going to have a baby, there should be no secrets between us. I'll tell you everything when I get back. I promise. Sweetheart. I love you so much. I love you too, dear. You'll be a great father. Believe me. I hope so... I have to go now. My meeting is about to start. Okay? - Okay. - Kisses. Nobody move! This is a robbery! Hands up! I'm serious, this is a robbery! Give me your gun! Get down! Get down! - Drop your gun! - Everyone get down! Drop it! - Drop your gun! - Drop the gun! Drop it! Put the gun down! Put that gun down! There you go! Put it down! Go over there! - Drop your gun! - Get down! - There! - Lie on the floor! You didn't think we'd leave you alone, did you! - We learned everything! Everything! - You're my brothers! I see people moving! Lie down, face down! - Lie down! You too! - Face down! You don't lie down, sister. You're pregnant. I'm not pregnant! Oh, sorry. So lie down, then! Sir, you're not lying down there! If you do as we say, nobody will be hurt. Namık, what shall we do? Don't say names! We're supposed to use the nicknames! Sorry, Namık, I called you Namık! Call me cyclamen! Cyclamen! No, cyclamen was Sadık's nickname! You were something else. Don't use real names! I'm cyclamen, he's lilac, you're fuchsia. I must be lilac and he must be fuchsia. I'm cyclamen, he's lilac, you're fuchsia! You're driving me mad, Adem! Why are you saying my name? Call me fuchsia, then! - Goodness... - Come on, let's hurry up. Fuchsia, go and get the watch from the back. Okay, cyclamen. I'm learning, am I not? God damn you... Quick! - Keep your head down! - Get out of the way! Or I'll kill you. Easy. Fuchsia to cyclamen and lilac. Fuchsia to cyclamen and lilac. I have a laser-related problem here! Come and save me! Lilac to fuchsia. I'm coming. Cyclamen to fuchsia. Lilac is on the way. Fuchsia to cyclamen. Can't you come instead? Lilac to fuchsia. What's wrong with me? Fuchsia to lilac. Nothing wrong, but... cyclamen is more experienced, you know. Lilac to fuchsia. I'm not coming after hearing that anyway! - Please, go... - I'm not going. - Come on. - I'm not going! We have to hurry. Please. Lilac to fuchsia. I'm coming for cyclamen's sake. Only because he insisted. Namık, you come. Come on, Namık. Sadık, move carefully. - What's going on? - The lasers are moving! - Oh. - You have to watch your step. There! Adem, it's coming! Right, you have to adjust your steps. Step over it. - It's all over the place! - Okay. Okay, enough! Stay there! Okay. Why are you coming closer? - Okay, it stopped. - But you came too close... This is... You're really going too far here, Sadık... What are you talking about, for God's sake? How do we turn this off? I'm trying to figure that out. Where's the switch? There must be a switch. Is something moving there? Do I sense movement? What's going on behind me? What are you talking about? What can I possibly do to you? - You're standing right next to me there! - It's not like I want to! Like I love doing this! Cyclamen to fuchsia and lilac. Couldn't you solve the problem yet? Cyclamen, we have a big problem. Lilac to cyclamen. Don't worry, we'll get it done. - What are you getting done? - Shut up, man. Come on, hurry. Put your head down! How can I turn this off? Sadık, are you moving bit by bit there? What are you doing there? Don't drive me mad! I'm trying to shut this off! I'm feeling something warm! I hope it's the laser! Hey, wait a minute. Was that why you didn't want me to move? - What's that got to do with this? - It's not like I... Forgive me, God! Adem, watch out! - What? - The laser is coming! Laser is coming! Duck! - Watch your head! - Wait a minute. What are you doing? Wait, what are you doing! I respected you as my elder. I trusted you. - You've violated my privacy! - What are you talking about? What kind of a man are you! What are you saying! See? The laser wasn't working! These guys were fooling us! Let's take that and get out of here... You're crazy! - I'll tell Namık what you did. - Adem, we're deep in trouble here. - Shut up for God's sake! - You abused me... You're here! Cyclamen, take the watch. Give it to me. Hey! You got a gun? Take that out! Show it to me. How come you have a gun? Are you a cop? Is he a cop? Is he? I'm a jeweler. It's my licensed gun. How much is a quarter gold coin? Tell me! How much is a quarter? - 440 liras. - He's right. He's a jeweler. So why are you still holding the gun? You want me to blow your brains out? Shall I blow it? Put that gun down! Put it down! Don't panic. Everyone, stay calm. - Keep your head down! - I'm not feeling good. Stay calm! - You shot the security guard! - Are you alright? I'm fine. This wound won't kill me, will it? - You'll be fine. - Let me take a look. He's losing blood! He'll die! What are you doing, for God's sake! Let me take a look... What's going on? - What's going on? - The gun went off in my ass! What? - Open it. - Not here! - Let me see it. - I can't open it here! Let me see it from here. - Can you see it? - I can. - How is it? - You’re alright. The bullet shaved past. - It skimmed? - It shaved. It shaved? Mind your words, man! He can't breathe! Take that off.

I'd like to name my son after you. - Your name? - Sadık. Yours? - Namık. - Adem. I don't like either of those. I'm sorry. I'm Adem! - Goodness... - Why didn't you ask my name? - I'm Adem Ballı.

Are the police continuing their investigation? How did the robbery happen? The three masked white goods dealers entered the exhibition through this door. They were carrying guns. The three men disappeared with a watch worth a million dollars. I had to return early from my trip abroad because of this incident. HOW TO BE A HAPPY KANGAROO Övgü Maral I'm very sorry. The perpetrators will be punished sooner or later. Thank you. Have a nice day. Adem! Adem? How is the wound looking? Well, had the bullet struck two centimeters to the side... What would've happened? You could've lose your ass! Don't talk like that in front of her! - I don't mind at all. - You mean the ass? The bullet skimmed. You're alright. Get up. So, what will you do now? Will you meet Demircan? We can't explain ourselves to the police. I wish we could meet Mr. Zafer. We could give him the watch, and tell him the facts. I just saw it on the news. Mr. Zafer returned early after the incident. I can reach his assistant, if you like. Gülçin is a close friend of mine. Wait a second. Who's calling? It's Şahin, but can you call Gülçin? Of course. I'll call her. - Did you hang up? - Yes. - It's ringing. - What did she say? It's still ringing. Yes, dear. Gülçin! I need to reach Mr. Zafer very urgently. - What happened? - You know about this robbery... - Of course I do. - Right. I have the dealers with me now. - With you? - With me. - Demircan did the whole thing! - Are you sure? Absolutely. I need to tell Mr. Zafer all the facts. Can you get us to meet him? Okay. Stay calm. I'll talk to... Mr. Zafer and arrange a meeting. Great. Can you share your location? We'll meet you. Okay. Right after I talk to him. - Okay. Thank you. - Let's go. - Come on. - The guns! - Come on! - I'm so anxious. No anxiety.

He's waiting for you at the terrace. - The terrace? - He wanted to meet at a secluded location. - Let's go. - Ms. Övgü... You shouldn't get involved in this part. Go back home. Mr. Namık, we're in this together all the way. I'm coming with you. Övgü, he's right. This may be dangerous. Go home. Okay. So I'm going home. Brother, leave us alone for a couple of minutes. Just two minutes. Okay, we'll wait at the door. Hurry. - Come on. - Let's go, Ms. Gülçin. Be careful, okay? - You? - I'll catch up with them. Well... Ms. Övgü, I wanted to talk to you about something. Talk. No... Adem, what are you doing... This is too early. Aren't you going too fast? Fast? When your shoelace is untied, you should tie it. You need to tie it before something goes wrong... You tied it fast. You're very practical. Yes, I'm practical. - Ms. Övgü, I have to ask you something. - What? Once this is all over... do you think we can meet for tea? - Tea? - Yes. Linden tea. Or other herbal teas. Perhaps green tea. - Green tea? - Yes. Green is my favorite color. As food, we could have... kinoa, coriander and palm fruit salad. - Palm fruit? - Palm fruit. - Ms. Övgü... - What? - I guess you're trying to impress me? - No... By saying "palm fruit"... Okay, okay... Okay... I think you should go now. You'll be late. Mr. Zafer is waiting. On the terrace. I think I should go. Sadık is waiting. Perhaps next time, I should kiss... lower. What's up? I hear you're looking for my father! What do you need my father for? We've been calling you, and you didn't pick up. - That's a shame... - Right... - Ms. Gülçin! - Well done, darling. - Wait for me in the car. - Okay, sweetheart. Now I see who Ms. Gülçin was "uniting" with! Shut up, pickle! Enough, gentlemen! Give me that watch now. Take it! Here. - This watch is fake! - Fake? You think you can play smart with me and get away with the watch? Don't drive me mad! Give me the watch! I have to deliver it tonight! - Tell me where it is, now! - Şahin, you asked us to bring the watch, and we did. I don't know if it's fake or not. - Let us go. - You did me wrong, man! And I'll punish that for you tonight! You'll be punished for all you did wrong! Şahin, start with your friend. He's the ringleader. Namık! Wait. What can I do, man... Shoot me. I don't shoot my family. What do you mean you don't shoot? You shoot him! - I said shoot him! - Wait! Run, run! Mushin! Don't shoot! Sadık! - Fire! Cover us! - Okay! Come on! Run! Adem, run! Come here! Run! - Stop shooting that! - I want to help out too! Watch out! Will this explode? - This thing is burning... We'll blow up! - It's fine. Calm down. - I'm out of bullets! - And this thing ran out of battery! Namık! Yes, Sadık? - I'm out of bullets! - Me too! They're out of bullets! Go get them! - You've been surrounded! - Cops. Surrender! Drop your weapons! Surrender. - I'll drop this. They may think it's real. - Drop it. Hands up! Put your gun down! Look in the shed! Arrest them! - Hands up! - Come here. Watch out! Put your hands up! Surrender! We don't have guns! - We're unarmed! We surrender! - Put the gun down! Hands behind your neck! - Arrest them! - No guns. Hands up! Let me see them behind your neck! Get him. Take his gun. You see? You ruined our lives, and your own... I can't believe what you did... Dad! Mr. Zafer! Are you looking for this? What! You stole from my pocket. You stole from my company. You stole from my safe. I closed my eyes to it all. But this time, you tried to rob me in an organized way. You left me with no option other than this set-up. What? So you were aware of everything? Of course I was. Do you think you could rob my exhibition so easily otherwise? Do you think that's easy? Dad, listen. I'm so embarrassed. Not of you, but of myself. I couldn't raise you well. If you loved me just a bit, and treated me decently, perhaps none of this would've happened. I spent my whole life trying to impress you, dad. Anyway. At long last, you did something for me. Take me away. I mean, let's go. Say something. Well, Mr. Zafer... we're happy to be proven innocent, but we're sorry that you went through something like this with your son. - That's unfortunate. - We really are. No. No. - I'm at fault too. - Oh, I see. The father is involved too. That's not what he means. He meant it metaphorically. So, I failed to create a family all these years... Kids... I waive all your debt to my company. - Right! - My God! I'll do anything for you! No, no... That was too much. - What are you doing? - Namık, we made it! But gentlemen, I have a condition. Yes? - Take care of your families. - We promise. You're coming with us to the precinct. Right away. Thank God, we've made it! What a relief! Do you think they'll let us go early? Ms. Övgü must be waiting. Why? Never mind. I shouldn't talk about this. - About what? - We kissed. No way! - Rafik. - What? I should call home from the precinct My wife must be worried. Goodness... What? I particularly miss her after action... SIX MONTHS LATER You got off lightly at the court, after all. Why do I have to save you all the time? You saved me once, for a change! Here you go. How does it taste? The meat is delicious. He touched the tongs with his mouth... Won't you have any, sweetie? No, sweetheart. Lovely girl! You saved your marriage, things might not be going well for you, "sweetheart". She divorced me! - What? - She divorced me. Why didn't you tell us? I don't know. I can't talk about these things. - So, what now? - I begged and insisted... and we started flirting again! Crazy girl! Come on, gentlemen! We're dying of hunger here. Pick them up, Namık. Take it. - The meat is burned. - You pick up the vegetables. - Adem, put those on the grill. - Dad. Dad, give me your plate. Serve them... Here, sweetheart. - I'm grilling the peppers too. - I don't want any. But you have to eat this delicious kebab. I don't want them. I'm feeling sick. Dad? Is mom pregnant again? Yes. Just one! Let me kiss you... God, look what I'm going through... Namık, stop talking and help! Come here, darling. - Are you counting beads? - No, I'm playing Pumching. What's your username? - Spider Lütfü 42. - Lütfü? - It's my middle name, you know. - Spider? It's a sacred animal. And 42 is for Konya. - You got it. - I really got it right. Why are you all sitting? Come on, stand up. - Let's jump! - No, no... - No. - Not now. Please, no... I'm joking. We're eating... My sweetheart is a joker... Mind your words! "Sweetheart", what's that? It's a shame for our family! I'm a grown-up now! Stop judging my relationships! You mind your own relationship. Our sexual chemistry is perfect! - I told you not to open up to me! - Perfect! Can everyone listen to me? I have an announcement to make. Adem, you can applaud after I speak. Right. My dear wife... Sorry, sweetheart, stand up. Will you marry me again? - Yes! - Oh God! Bravo, bravo! - My dear wife! - Bravo! You're my true love, girl!
