(funky music) (Roy sniffing) (knocking on door) - How do I look? - Fabulous. - [Roy] Hello, ladies. - [Ginger] May we come in? - [Roy] Why not? And to what do I owe this pleasure? - We're a welcome to LA gift basket from Uncle A. (giggles) - Uncle A sure out done himself this time. You ladies feel free to help yourself to any of the party material. (Roy sniffs) - Um, no thanks, we're on duty. - [Roy] She gonna join us? - Hmm, not just yet, she's training. - What's your name, honey? - Ginger. - (chuckles) Ginger. You're killing me. - Mm, that's what they all say. - Whoa, you're strong! What have they been feeding you down there, Ginger? - They got me on an all meat diet, Roy, with the occasional protein shake. - How'd you know I like this? - I know that you're a bad boy and you need to be punished. - Why don't you come over here and sit on my face and tell me what a bad boy I am? - You're the boss, Roy. - What the fuck? That Uncle A's a fucking bastard. I'm gonna kill him. Man, he got me good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, jokes over. - [Ginger] Coco? - This shit ain't funny no more. - I believe he mentioned something to me about sitting on your face, didn't he, Coco? (funky music) - Wait now, enough's enough, enough's-- (Roy mumbles) - Coco, could you order some daiquiris? - We'd like two daiquiris, please. What kind do you have? Hold on please. They have mango daiquiris. Mango it is, thank you. Ginger? - Hm? - I think you're finished. - Oh, duh. (Ginger sighs) (Ginger sniffs) (Coco sniffs) (energetic music) - Oh, it's dancing! (light Oriental music) You know, my birthday's coming up soon. - No it's not, actually we just celebrated your birthday last month. In fact, that's the third time we've celebrated your birthday this year. - How many more shopping days are there until Christmas? - What do you want, Coco? - Nothing, I'm just making small talk. - Coco? - Lemona Blarnekeys has just come out with a new shoe. - You already have three pairs of Lemona Blarnekeys, and you know how expensive they are. - They are not for me. - Well who are they for? - Oh, you're kidding, right? - You have to see them, Ginger. They're this darling little Lemona Blarnekeys, masterpieces, handmade, exclusively for Lovely Linda. Please, Ginger? It's a limited once in a lifetime release. - No. - They're very rare and hard to get. - No. - Destined to become a collector's item. - Um, no. - Please? - You know, your little Lovely Linda collection? It's turning into quite the obsession. - It's just a hobby. It's perfectly normal and healthy. - Fine, I'll look into it, hmm? - Look into what? - The Lemona Blarnekeys. - Oh, I love you, Ginger. - [Ginger] I love you too, Coco. (light music) ♪ Wah wah wah ♪ ♪ Na na na na ♪ ♪ Nah ♪ ♪ Wah wah wah wah ♪ ♪ Wah ♪ Man this, this is a big shower. Only jails have big showers like this. I, I hate big showers. High schools, they uh, they have big showers, but uh, guys bathing with guys, that's just not right. How you doing, Bobby? It was good work you done with Roy. - Yeah, Uncle A is pleased. I hope you're ready for more work. It's gonna get really hairy around here. Anyway, we just want to give you a heads up, 'cause um, Uncle A's been acting stranger than usual. - Stranger than usual? He's a fucking loon. What, I'm just saying. I think it's the syphilis. - Tony! - That shit eats away at your brain, like Caligula. - Tony! - I'm just saying. It was funny what you done with his eyes? - What're you talking about? - You know, his eyes? - Don't mind him, Bobby. Let's go. - What, what? - Damnit, where's my shot? You know I can't think straight without it. Anthony, Tony, get over here right away! I need my shot. - Did you get his medicine? - No, what're we gonna do? - Shit. Ah, easy, Uncle A, calm down. I got your shot right here. - (growls) Dammit. Okay, so where were we? - We were nowhere, we just got here. - Roy, I've been thinking about Roy. I want that son of a bitch dead, do you understand me? D-E-D, dead. - He is dead, Bobby killed him. - Roy's dead? Eh. Well then we should send some flowers to the funeral, something nice. - I'll uh, I'll send some tulips. - Tulips? No tulips! Roses, roses are for funerals. Tulips are for, I dunno what the hell tulips are for. But no tulips, do you understand me? - I, I like tulips. - Tulips are stupid, you moron. - No tulips, Uncle A, we'll make a note of that. Now what's next for Bobby? I've got him standing by. - Oh yeah, get that Bobby over here. He's the only one around here with any balls, besides me. - He's right here, Uncle A. - Okay. Have him take care of Roy. - Roy? - Not Roy, you moron, Roy's dead. Pay attention! I want Louie dead. - It's Louie, you're sure? - Sure I'm sure. I may be getting on, but I ain't crazy. (suspenseful music) - He's getting loopier and loopier. What'd Louie do to him? - Oh, who knows, who cares? It's easier to have people killed than to ask questions. I'll call you with the details. - Right. - (sighs) I just wish he'd die so I could take over. - You take over? What about, what about me? Yeah, yeah, you're right. - Shut the fuck up. (mellow music) (knocking on door) - That's Bobby. - Loopy. - Now Coco, you be nice to him. - He's the one that's not nice. - Coco. - All right, I'll be nice. (Ginger sighs) - You look great, Ginger. - I know. - What's the matter, baby? - What the hell did you do to Roy's eyes? - Oh, that. Well that was Coco. (Coco giggles) - It's not funny. They almost tripped me up because of that. You need to tell me these things. I need to know all the details on each job. - Of course you do, sweetie. Let me get you a drink, all right? - Why you always here? Can't you give Ginger and me a minute of peace? - You know, Lovely Linda has just come out with a new Bobby doll. Do you wanna see it? "Hi, I'm Bobby, and I'm a giant ass." - What kinda freak plays with dolls at your age? - (sighs) You sound just like my papi. He always yell at me for playing with Lovely Linda dolls. If you're gonna play with dolls, at least play with a guy doll. And you know what I thought? Like most men, Steve has no balls. So, if I'm gonna be a person with no balls, I'd rather be Lovely Linda. She's so much more glamorous. - Ginger! - Yes, sweetie? - Um, Coco, do you mind terribly? - No, I'll be in my room. - Oh honey, you need to relax. - I'm under a lot of pressure, Ginger. Every time I go in there to meet Uncle A and the boys, I'm putting my life on the line. - I know. - And I'm doing it for us. - I know. - I mean, what if they find out that I'm not the killer? What if they find out that you're the killer? And what if they find out about you, and us? (Ginger speaks in foreign language) - What the hell does that mean? - Shh. - Ginger, I'm serious. - You want me to have the operation, don't you? - I want you to be happy, Ginger. I want us to be happy, together. I think getting the operation's the right way to get there. - Fine then, it's settled, you want-- - We. - We. We want me to get the operation, and this is a quick and easy way for us to get the money to do it. (Bobby chuckles) - You're right, Ginger, as usual. - Then it's settled. I'll keep working, and afterwards we're all gonna be very happy. You and me-- - Don't even say her name. This is about the two of us, no Coco. Do you see what I mean? She always starts it. - Listen, sweetie you look tired. Why don't you go home tonight and get some rest, okay? Everything will look better in the morning. - Oh, there's another job coming up. I'll let you know where and when. - Fine. Do I get a kiss or what? Goodnight, sweetie. - Goodnight, Ginger. (door shuts) - Coco. (light music) - I'm sorry, Coco, but Bobby, who I have no idea why I like and can't fathom why any woman would date him, doesn't like you. But what about you and me, Ginger? I don't like you, either. In fact, I hate you. You must go out and live alone in the streets, where you will eventually die of loneliness. Oh, Ginger! - Oh please. You are such a drama queen. You know I would never leave you. - I know. - (scoffs) Between you and Bobby, I think I've had enough for one night. - I'm sorry, Ginger. We should probably get high now. - We probably should. (singing in foreign language) (eclectic music) - Ginger, we're going to be late. (holy music) - What do you think? - Ginger, I think it's a bit much. Perfect! Oh, I have a surprise for you. - What the hell is that? - It's a tribal blow dart gun with poison darts. I made it just for you. - Are you sure that thing'll work? - Of course I'm sure. I got the recipe from a very reliable source. - What source? - A lovely college student I met in the internet. Anyway, I made the poison with love, so I know it will work. - (sighs) I dunno. - Ginger, you need to expand your repertoire, and blow darts are very exotic. - Don't you think it'll clash with my outfit? - Hmm, you're right, we'll use it some other time. - Come on! (birds chirping) (upbeat music) And remember to look out for cops. - Ginger? - Hm? - I am a professional. - Of course you are, sweetie. - Ginger? - Hm? - Do you think it's wrong to kill people? - No. - Okay, okay. - (gasps) There he is, red carnation, we're on! - Louie Spashachesky? You have been deemed a sinner, and for that you must atone. (tires squealing) (flesh squelches) - Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dropping like flies. You know who's responsible? Me! I'm in charge. You know how you kill a fly? - Well, you could use a fly swatter or a bug zapper, or one of those sticky things that looks like a roll of film that you hang from the ceiling, or you could-- - Shut up, numb nuts, that's not how you kill a fly. No, you gotta rip its wings off, then you watch it flutter around a little until there's no hope left. Then ya crush its tiny little head until it explodes. (phone rings) - Yeah? It's for you. - Who else would it be for? Hello? - [Richie] Hello, Uncle A. - Get lost. Hey Richie, how's it going? - [Richie] You tell me. First Roy, then Louie, it seems all of our partners are experiencing untimely deaths. - Yeah, I heard about that. It's a fucking shame. Bad luck is what it is, Richie. - [Richie] I hope you're right, because greed is a terrible thing, my friend. - Take it easy, Richie. Tell everybody to just stay calm. Look, the deal's the same as it was before, only now we don't have as many mouths to feed. - [Richie] I hope you're right, old man. I'll be in touch. (phone thumps) - Get me Bobby, I need people dead! - Let's ride. (groovy music) (water bubbling) (Coco coughs) (door thumps) - Bobby, baby. - Ginger, we need to stop. I can't handle this anymore. It's been too many murders, and the cops are hassling everyone. I think I'm being followed. Uncle A's crazy. He keeps wanting more and more people killed. I keep thinking every murder's gonna be the last, and then there's someone else he wants to get rid of. And Anthony and Tony? I don't know if they're starting to suspect something. They keep asking me for details about each murder, how I did it, what happened. It's all I can do to keep from completely losing it when I'm with them, and now they want someone else killed. I couldn't talk my way out of it. I told them I wanted a break, but he said I had to get rid of one more guy. Ginger, you don't understand. I'm going through 40 hells over here. So do this last job, baby, and that's it. We're outta here, someplace nice. Someplace safe where nobody knows us. I mean, we gotta stop. It's gonna be the last hit. - It's not the last hit, we've got plenty more in the bedroom. (Ginger chuckles) - Damnit, Ginger, you promised we'd be alone tonight. - We should go to Virginia Beach. I hear it's great. - We are not going to Virginia Beach. - Virginia Beach is for lovers! - Then take your dolls and go, 'cause I can tell you one thing. Wherever Ginger and I go, you're not coming. You hear me, we're going alone. Please tell her she can't come, Ginger, please? - Fine, I'll go to Virginia Beach all by myself. (suspenseful music) (Ginger sighs) - So what do you say, baby? - Bobby, maybe-- - Ginger, please. We gotta do one last hit, tonight. - Oh, come on, don't worry your pretty little head. I will do the last hit, okay? And then we'll get the hell outta here, I promise. - Oh, there's one more thing. - Hm? - This guy's got a briefcase, and Uncle A wants it, bad. - Briefcase, no problem. Have you seen the bong? - Oh man, sleep it off, Ginger. I'll call ya later. - Copy that. (door thumps) (dramatic music) You ready? - I'm always ready. - Now listen, we gotta kill him, and we gotta get his briefcase. I just want everything to go nice and easy, okay? - There's just one thing, Ginger. - What? - We never, ever do nothing nice and easy. - Let's kick it. (groovy music) Don't move. - Oh my god. - Can I help you ladies? - You can sit down, now. - Have we met before? I'm sure we have not, because I would never forget two beautiful faces such as yours. (glass tinkles) (Ginger gasps) - What the hell was that? Don't let him out of your sight. - I wouldn't dream of it. - Coco! - Yes? Yes, I'm fine, go and check on the noise. - Coco, that's a lovely name. - Did anyone ever tell you-- - Yes. - What's in the briefcase? - Just a few collectables. Would you care to see? - Why not? - Please. (heart beating) - Oh my god. - You like this doll? - You have the New Wave Lovely Linda doll? - Yes, I do. I understand these are quite rare. - They were made in 1983, but quickly recalled and destroyed due to the parents' outrage. There are only 10 New Wave Lovely Linda dolls known to exist. It is the ultimate Lovely Linda collectable. - Would you care to hold it? - May I? - I insist. - (chuckles) I can't believe I'm actually holding it. - Coco? - Yes? - It was a stupid cat. (gasps) Coco! What happened? - He collects Lovely Linda dolls. - Coco, this is not a good thing. (phone rings) - [Bobby's Voicemail] Hey, this is Bobby, how you doing? Leave a message. (phone beeps) - Bobby, it's me, pick up the phone. (sighs) All right, call me back when you get this message. - [Coco] No answer? - No, where could he be? - Have a drink. - No, I'm not in the mood, sweetie, I have to get ahold of Bobby before he talks to Uncle A. This was exactly what I was afraid of happening. - I'm sorry, Ginger. - No honey, it's not your fault. No, it was my job, I screwed things up. - Do you wanna get high? - No. - Let's go dancing. - Honey, I have to get in touch with Bobby. I don't want him to get in trouble 'cause of me. - But why don't you go over to his apartment and wait for him? - Well he um, he told me never to go over there. He thought it wouldn't be good if we were, you know, seen together. - Oh, Ginger. - Oh Coco, it's not that. No, he just didn't want me to be tied into the killings. - Well, if you wanna believe that, fine, but you know the real reason. He is ashamed of you. - No, he is not! - Then why wouldn't he want you coming over? Why wouldn't he proudly show off the most beautiful woman in town? I'm sorry, Ginger, but he is ashamed of you, that's why he wants you to get the operation. - The operation was my idea. - Was it? Have you even thought it through? Ginger, you are beautiful just the way you are, and he should love you just the way you are. I don't know, Coco, maybe you're right. I don't know what to do, you know, I love him so much. I just wanna make him happy. - Even if it means butchering yourself? (Ginger shudders) (phone rings) Come on, Bobby, pick up the phone. - [Bobby's Voicemail] Hey, this is Bobby, how you doing? - Dammit. - Ginger? - Hm? - If Lovely Linda were alive, do you think that she would like me? - I know she would, sweetie. - Why don't you go to sleep and dream happy dreams? - Mm, no, I'm too on edge, I'm just gonna stay up and give myself a facial. - Mm, don't worry, Ginger, I look out for you. - Yeah, but who's gonna look out for Bobby? - You remember when you used to come over and play with my niece, little Angie? She always came running home saying, "Bobby took my dolls, he won't let me play with them." You remember that? (light music) I always thought you were gonna grow up to be a queer. (Tony laughs) Imagine my surprise when you, of all people, turn out to be my number one enforcer. So, you swear you killed Richie, but you don't know where the briefcase is? - He looked dead when I left him. - He looked dead? He was dead, and then he looked dead. The only thing I'm sure about is that you're full of shit, which makes me wonder what else you're lying about, like whether or not you got that briefcase. - I'll take care of this, Uncle A. (chuckles) Hey, mister bigshot ain't so big anymore, huh? Mister tough guy, tough guy ain't so tough anymore. Mister mean killer man ain't so mean anymore, is he? - Okay, we get it, Tony. Shut the fuck up. (phone rings) - It's Richie. - He must be calling from the grave. - Hey, Richie, what's going on? - [Richie] Now you have women doing your dirty work for you? - What women? - [Richie] Please, Uncle A, those two ladies you sent over to kill me tonight. Bruto is quite angry. He wants revenge for the unfortunate deaths of Roy, Louie, Jojo, and Chan. - [Bruto] We were supposed to split everything nice and even, and you had to go and fuck us. Well I'm gonna fuck you, you little son of a bitch, when I take that fucking wheelchair and shove it up your fucking ass, you scumbag motherfucker. - Guys, it wasn't me. I don't know who those broads are. I'll look into it, then we'll split up the stuff, just like we planned, okay? Just keep your eye on that briefcase. I'll take care of everything. - [Bruto] I hope so, Uncle A, for your sake. (phone thumps) - You had women doing our hits? (Bobby screams) Women? - What do you know about these two broads, Bobby? - It's a fucking embarrassment. Women doing our hits? If word got out about this, we'd never hear the end of it. They'd carve up my empire like a dead pig! We gotta do something about this. We got to find these women. - Maybe one of these broads is Bobby's girlfriend, huh? Maybe they both are. - Two girlfriends, wow. - [Anthony] What do you know about these two broads, Bobby? Now would be a good time to start talking. - Let's torture him. (stapler clicks) - That's real intimidating, Tony. Why don't you have him drink some liquid paper next time. What's it gonna be, Bobby? (phone rings) - Bobby? Coco. It's for you. - This is Coco. No way. I am so there. Thanks, I'll call you later. Ginger, I have great news. - What? - Guess who's coming into town? - Who? (lovely harp music) Lovely Linda? (lovely harp music) Lovely Linda on ice? - Yes! Can we go, can we go, can we go? - It just gets better and better. - You're still sad. - I know something's wrong. - Well he could be sleeping or visiting his mother, his phone doesn't work, or he has laryngitis, or-- - Thanks, Coco. - Anyway, I have just the thing to cheer us up. - Us? - When you are sad, I am sad. Don't move. (light music) - (gasps) Oh, that is beautiful. - Have a finger sandwich. - Mm, delicious. - Can never go wrong with a Dutch paprika. Oh, I almost forgot the soap. - (gasps) Oh, I don't know, do you think we should? - [Coco] I think we should. - Now? - Now. - [Ginger] I'm not sure if now is a good time. - [Coco] It's always a good time. (both giggling) (cups tinkling) (Ginger sighs) Are you getting off yet? - No. - How about now? - Give it time. - Okay. Are you getting off yet? - Coco? - Yes, Ginger? - Do you see a large man standing in front of us? - Yes I do. - This is some good acid. Can we help you? - Yeah, you can help me. You can help me avenge my friends by dying a slow, miserable bitch death. But first you can tell me where the fuck the doll is. - There are two dolls standing right in front of you, silly. - The real doll! (dramatic music) - [Ginger] Don't you touch her. (man grunts) (punch thuds) - Now I've seen everything, bitches trying to do hits. (Ginger moans) First I'm gonna get my hands on that doll, and then I'm gonna fuck you, and then I'm gonna kill you, and not necessarily in that order. - You leave her alone! - Huh, maybe you know where the doll is. (dart whizzes) (man grunts) You fucking bitch. I'm gonna fucking kill you, you're gonna be so goddamned dead. You don't know how, you know how, how fucking dead you're gonna be. What the fuck? The fuck's happening? Is who fucking... I'm gonna fucking kill you. Oh. (grunts) (Ginger grunts) - Jive ass turkey. - I told you it would work. I guess the poison took awhile because he was so big. - What'd a big goon like that want with a Lovely Linda doll? - Ginger, it's not a Lovely Linda doll, it's the Lovely Linda doll. - Really, how much is it worth? - According to the Lovely Linda Collectors Guide, in mint condition in the box, New Wave Lovely Linda doll is worth about $11,000. The one we have would probably fetch about $9,000. - $9,000 for a doll? - It's worth so much more than that. It is the ultimate Lovely Linda collectable. - Coco? - Yes, Ginger? - I'm starting to get off now. (intense electronic music) - I was. - Yes. - Ginger? - Hmm? - What do we do with him? - Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. (Ginger moans) Let's go for a walk. - Hey ah, what happened to Bruto? - I don't even wanna know. - Should we pick 'em up? - No no no, let's follow 'em, see where they go first. Blonde's cute. - I wouldn't kick either of them outta bed. (intense electronica music) (dramatic music) - I'm Moonji, and you are two beautiful flowers. Please, sit. Mm, you are both lost, looking for love, hm? Search no more. You've heard of the wonderful powers of Moonji's magic men-phrodisiac, huh? And, hm, here it is. Quite affordable, only $19.95 per bottle, two for $30. - Is it raspberry? I love blue raspberry. - That's not what we came for. - Oh, I see. Then how can Moonji be of assistance, hm? Would you like to visit loved ones of the past, or do you dare to discover what the future may possess, hm? - Can you really contact the dead? - If that is what you wish, my child. - I would love to speak to Desi Arnaz. - Desi Arnaz? The devilish handsome Cuban band leader? - Yes, yes, can you contact him? - (chuckles) I wish. Oh, no no no, I'm very sorry, Moonji can only contact close relatives and the like. - Moonji, tell us about our future. - I see wonderful things in your future. I see... (gasps) Oh, great one! Oh, I see death and betrayal and more death, and, and tiny, tiny little shoes. And death! (gasps) - Same old, same old. - Great Moonji, did you see anything else in our future? - Wait, wait. Moonji sees something, oh yes. After you have swam through a terrible sea of blood, oh yes, you will find yourself on a great shore filled with glowing, glowing sand. - Ah, we're going to Virginia Beach. What a great fortune! Let's go home and try on bathing suits. - Be careful. (Ginger chuckles) - I'm tired. We shouldn't have left the car running. - I don't even remember driving. - Hello, ladies. - Hi. - We're gonna take you little ladies for a ride. - Great, my feet are killing me. - No thanks, we'll walk. - I dunno, it might be fun. - [Ginger] What do you think, Coco? - No, I don't think so. He kisses kinda boring. (gun clicks) - We weren't asking. - Charming. (dramatic music) (Anthony grunts) - Ow! - Anthony, Anthony, what should I do? - Hit her! - But, but, she's a girl! - [Anthony] So what? - Such gentlemen. (punches thudding) How do I look? - Fabulous. - [Tony] I, I think I'm in love. - Shut the fuck up. - You know what I'm saying? (light music) (Uncle A spits) You can buy sunflower seeds without the shells, but they don't taste the same. You wanna know why? 'Cause you gotta earn the flavor. (spits) I mean, you gotta sit here and chew and wrestle these little fuckers. (spits) Yeah, that's all the fun. You know what I'm saying? (spits) Gimme my coffee. What the fuck is this stuff floating on the top? How the hell do you serve me something like this? What are you, some kind of fucking animal? Here, here, take it back, make it right. (grunts) The dynamic duo returns. What the, did Bruto do this to you? - No. - Yeah. - [Uncle A] Well, which is it? - No, Bruto didn't do this. The girls took care of him. (Uncle A grunts) - Please, tell me you were in a car accident, then a piano fell on ya. Tell me anything, except that two women just beat the crap outta ya. - It's like this. - No, I'll tell you like it is. You just got your asses kicked by two girls, so no story, no excuses, nothing is gonna erase that fact. - But they were really, really strong. - Come on, Uncle A, give us another chance. - What's worse than getting beat up by a woman? Getting beat up by a woman twice! Richie is coming by tomorrow night to settle a little score, huh, and I don't want those bitches getting in the way. I'm bringing in some outside help. Get me Mr. Fly on the phone. He'll take care of this. (Uncle A sneezes) Maybe then we'll get some fucking dignity back in this family. (upbeat horn music) (birds chirping) (Ginger moans) - (yawns) Where are we? - We're in our car. - [Coco] Where is our car? - I have no idea. - How did we get in our car? - Coco, please. - Let's go home, Ginger. I need a shower. And my makeup. - I don't think that'll be a good idea right now. Well between that large ape who tried to kill us last night and those two idiots in the alley, I'd say someone was after us. - That means we are hunted, and we are homeless and must now fend for ourself in this cold, dark city. - Something like that, Coco. (phone rings) Hello? (sighs) Bobby, where have you been? - Ah, my aunt got real sick and I had to take my mom over there to take care of her, and she didn't have a phone, so I couldn't call, and uh, I couldn't leave because I thought she was gonna die and I wanted to be there for it, you know? Anyway, that's why I haven't called. - Oh, thank god, Bobby, I thought something happened to you. I guess you heard about that hit I bungled. - [Bobby] Yeah, I heard. - Baby, I miss you. - [Bobby] Ginger, I need you to do another hit. - Bobby, I don't think now's a good time, there's a lot of weird stuff happening and-- - [Bobby] Listen, I can't talk right now, okay? This last job is gonna make all that weird stuff go away. I promise, okay? - Okay. - [Bobby] I'll call you later. - Bobby, I love you! - [Both] Aww! (Ginger sighs) - I'm so happy. - I'm not. We need new clothes. - We'll go shoplifting, my treat. (dramatic music) How do I look? - Fabulous. - And I feel fabulous. You said everything would be fine, and you were right, Coco. - I was just trying to make you feel better, Ginger. Honestly, I thought Bobby was dead. I'm surprised he didn't get into trouble. - Hmm, well I'm sure he'll explain everything to me over dinner. Um, Coco? - Don't worry, I won't be around tonight to cramp your style. - You're a doll, Coco, but that's not what I meant. Would you mind staying in the car? - What, why? - I'll just be a minute, there's no point in us both going in there, and I need you to keep a look out. - But we're a team! - Well of course we are, sweetie, I just want things to go smoothly. - What you're really saying is you don't want me around to screw things up. - I never said that. - You didn't have to. - Coco. - Superwoman never left Supergirl in the car. - Well actually I don't think that there was a Superwoman. Maybe you're thinking of Wonder Woman. - Don't tell me what I'm thinking. Didn't you just adore Wonder Woman Power Bracelets? Fine, go off all by yourself and have all the fun. The ugly stepsister will just sit at home while Cinderella has fun at the ball. - (snorts) I'll be right back. - I might be waiting for you. Ginger? - Yes? - (sighs) Good luck. (upbeat electronica music) - I poured you one. - I think you were expecting someone else. - Oh, I always expect a beautiful young lady to appear. (chuckles) I'd offer you some strawberries, but I can see that your hands are full. Feeling a little tired? Would you like to lay down on the sofa, relax? - (sniffs) Did you drug this? - Oh, I might have slipped in a mickey or two. - (laughs) That's cute, except I have one of these for breakfast, every morning. You have quick hands. - So I've been told. - Should I dive for the gun, or should you? - I just bought this suit. But maybe we can settle this some other way. - Oh, (gasps) oh, maybe we can. (Mr. Fly laughs) (groovy music) Here, wouldn't want you to mess up that pretty face. (sabres clinking) (Ginger grunts) - Ooh, man that Bobby was a fool to let you go. - What the hell does Bobby have to do with this? - Nothing, no, it's about you and me! (sabres clinking) (Mr. Fly groans) (kick thuds) - I, I, I can't think of anything witty to say. - Coco. (Ginger gasps) (funky music) - This is one of the broads that beat you up? - No, it's not her, Uncle A, it's Ginger. She's the tough one. - So what happened to Mr. Fly? (Anthony sighs) You're kidding me. Okay, forget about that. Now Richie's coming by here, and I don't want anything to mess up this exchange. Put her someplace. - You have no chance of winning. Ginger is a force unto herself, a beautiful, deadly creature. Capable of giving great pleasure and great pain, she-- - All right, all right. We get it, she's fucking Superwoman. - Actually, actually there wasn't a Superwoman. It was another character. - (groans) Shut up! God, I need some air. Watch her! (mysterious music) - [Richie] Hello, Uncle A. - Finally. - Did you get those two women? - Eh, we got one of them, but don't worry about that now. Let's split up the take. You know how long I've been looking forward to this? - What's the matter? - Where's the doll? Where's the New Wave Lovely Linda doll? - Those two women who tried to kill me have it. What's the difference, we have the rest. We got an easy 400 lives in that briefcase. (Uncle A growls) - I want the doll! I want the New Wave Lovely Linda doll! (gunshots blasting) The New Wave Lovely Linda doll! - I wish, I wish this wasn't happening like this. I really think you're beautiful. - Really? Mm, mm. - What's the matter? - I'm all cramped up from sitting so long. My legs are killing me. - Do you want me to um-- - Rub them? Yes. (lively jazz music) Mm, that's nice. - Oh my god, you, you, you gotta-- - [Anthony] What's going on? - Nothing, nothing, I was, I was just watching her like you told me to. I didn't, I didn't touch her or anything. A thing, I swear. - What happened? - She's transvestited. - What? - She's, she's, she's got a dick. - You're kidding me. Why would a beautiful blonde like that hang out with a transvestite? Oh shit. If Uncle A or anybody finds out about this, we are dead. It's bad enough two women, but two chicks with dicks, goddamnit. We tell no one. - No one. You know, I'll never understand why a beautiful girl like that would go and get a dick. - You're retarded, you know that? (door thumps) - Ginger? - Surprised to see me alive? (punch thuds) - It's nice to see you, too. Come on, grab some things, let's get outta here. I'm sick of this place. Just think about it, you and me, sipping margaritas, watching the sunset. - Bobby, how could you? - I didn't have a choice. They made me do it. It's your fault. If you hadn't messed up that job, none of this would have happened. Come on, it's not like I wanted to set you up. I knew you could handle Mr. Fly with your eyes closed. Come on, let's get outta here. - Where's Coco? - I don't know. - Where the hell is Coco? - I don't know where she is. If I knew where she was, I'd tell you, I swear. - What the hell is going on, Bobby? - I picked up a bit of a phone call here, a bit of Uncle A's mumbling there. Turns out Uncle A set up a heist with those guys you killed. They robbed some big time collector. He had all sorts of old stuff. He had a Super Comics number one in mint condition, a 1927 Sugar Shack Johnson rookie card. I mean, all that old stuff is worth a lot of money, you know, a fortune. Anyways, I figured he wanted all that stuff for himself, and that's why he got all those guys killed, but I was wrong. Turns out he just wanted a doll. - A doll? - Yeah, some kind of New Wave doll? - New Wave Lovely Linda doll. - Yeah, you got it? - Yeah, I got it. - Oh, baby that's sweet! All right, here's what we're gonna do. We're just gonna mail him the doll. He'll be so happy, he'll forget all about us, and then it'll just be the two of us. What do you say? - What about Coco? - Fuck Coco! (punch thuds) - You know I can't believe you, Bobby. After all that I've done for you. God, I almost changed myself for you. You know, I may not be perfect, but I'm damn good just the way I am. In fact, you could say that I am the best of both worlds. It's a shame that you never realized that. - Ginger. (kick thuds) (phone rings) - Coco? Coco! Hello, Uncle A. Yes, I do, so don't hurt my doll and I won't hurt yours. I'll be over in an hour. (mellow organ music) (energetic music) - Killing, killing, killing women ain't right. - Yeah well if you have any hesitation, keep thinking about their dicks. - That's kinda gay, Anthony. (upbeat Latin music) (gun blasting) (singing in foreign language) (gun blasts) When, when, when should we jump in? - Soon, very soon. (singing in foreign language) (gun blasts) - Damnit, this is un-fucking-believable. Anthony, Tony, kill her! (gun blasts) (mysterious music) - (grunts) I didn't even feel that, you dumb bitch. Anthony, Tony, get her. (gun blasts) - I give up, I give up! I don't, I don't, I don't have a gun. You can't, you can't shoot me. (gun blasts) - Enough of this shit, where's the doll? - The doll belongs to Coco. - Oh really? (gun blasts) - Coco! (gun blasts) (gun clatters) - I want that doll! I deserve that doll. Please. Can I just hold it for a moment, I promise I won't bleed on it. Please, I want that doll. (gun blasts) - Are you an angel? - I'm sorry, Coco, no. - Oh, Ginger. - Oh don't worry darling, everything's gonna be fine. Tomorrow we'll buy Lovely Linda a new pair of shoes. - The Lemona Blarnekeys? - The Lemona Blarnekeys. - Oh Ginger, you are an angel. - I cannot believe Uncle A went through all this trouble for a little doll. - Oh Ginger, he's a collector. (Coco shudders) - Oh, Coco, oh my god! Coco, Coco, Coco! Coco! Coco? Coco? Coco? Coco? - Yes? - You haven't said a thing about my new bathing suit. How do I look? - Fabulous. (energetic music) (happy music) (gun blasts)
