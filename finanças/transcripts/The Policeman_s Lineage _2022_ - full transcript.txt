Provided by Synchronized ACEMAKER MOVIEWORKS presents a LEEYANG FILM production Executive producer JUNG Hyun-joo Producer LEE Han-seung Directed by LEE Kyu-man The Policeman's Lineage Let go! Son of a bitch! Stay where you are. Your head's next. Detective! I'm coming down, please... Here it is. Who are you handing this to? You just saw me come in. Listen to this guy. No security cams nearby. So you came in here by sheer chance? Yes. I'll count to three. One. Two! Hey, listen, this isn't yours, right? Right. Sir, we should take him in. Let go, we were staking out for days for him. This is next. Is it yours or not? It's mine! That drug is mine! Witness, please come forward. As a Seocho Police Major Crimes officer you've investigated my client with Det. Sohn Byung-sik, and you were present at the crime scene during his arrest. Is this correct? Was my client forcibly arrested? Yes. Defense rests. There he comes. Choi Min-jae! Backstabbing bastard! Easy, easy! Don't do this here, take it easy. I understand who you are, I do, but I'm still dumbfounded. You go on ahead. It was a month-long stakeout, stupid bastard... - I'll arrest him again... - Shut your mouth. Lay low and come back when things die down. Choi Min-jae. You're the only one just? That's what I'm saying! Why are you so anal? Stay outside for a while and go home. All right. Oh yeah, Choi. Internal Affairs wants you. Choi Min-jae? We're from the Metro. This is Det. Hwang In-ho, Internal Affairs section chief. Major Crimes, Choi Min-jae, sir. I called you here for a favor. Yes, sir. We'd like you to covertly carry out an internal investigation. Police Record: Park Kang-yoon Go after a cop, you mean? Is this an order? It's nothing like that, the decision is yours. Then I'd like to decline. This is dishonorable. It's also outside of my duties. My apologies, I'll head out. A cop died because of this incident. Honor of the police is on the line. We must get to the bottom of it before it gets out. Ever heard of Investigation Unit's Park Kang-yoon? He's a major player at Metro. His specialty is intel gathering. From gangs, drugs to gambling, he's got informants at every level. He's simply unrivaled. Heard about the Wonju factory drug bust 3 years ago? Yes, I remember. Wasn't it a joint op between NIS and narcos... It looked that way, but Park did that alone. (New Drug Distribution Gang Arrested) Is that possible? It's possible, if he crossed the line. Roundup of New Gang 21st Century Clan We believe that Park is backed by a special organization. He's given tens of thousands of dollars to investigate, which are all from unknown source. So how does the death of a cop fit into this? We had a man in his unit digging into him. Sgt. Lee Myung-ju, he was killed. We believe that he instigated Lee's death after finding out, and destroyed the evidence. Which means, a cop had another cop killed. Why me, sir? Why did you become a cop? My... father walked this path. I wanted to follow... That's it, lineage. Grandfather, Choi Eul-young, father, Choi Dong-su, and you. Three generations of cops. A cop's blood flows in you. Your father passed away in the line of duty, no? Yes, sir. Everyone knew the man who dissolved the 3-Way clan. Is that so? But his on the job death was never acknowledged? No, sir. Did you know there is a secret report on him? I'll share it with you after this detail. He took a child hostage! Min-jae, it's your dad. I heard he was a cop. Jeon Yong-bae! This is Choi Dong-su! Let's talk, okay? Let your daughter go, take me instead. Good to see you. This bitch tried to kill me with poison... Jeon, please don't do this. Mister... Please let me go, someone's taking my child... Dad! Dad! Dad! No! Dad! Dad! Dad! No! This was your father's. Internal Affairs Hwang In-ho Hello, this is Choi Min-jae. Sir, it was an order from the section chief... What are you doing? Put the mask back on. I could be hunted down, sir. Take him. Detective, sir! You don't know what they'll do! He exploits the media like this. Customs Agent Killed Colleague For Drugs He's a clever manipulator. But there's someone who's driving Park crazy. Na Young-bin, I'm sure you've heard of him. CEO of Mirae Corp - A big shot in this field, 3 convictions for production and distribution of illegal drugs. He comes from money, studied overseas. He doesn't need to do this, but he's got the smarts. From politics to media, his connections are limitless. Park arrested Na 3 times, but Na got away every damn time. No wonder Park's pissed. Here, the one handing over the bag is Cha. The one receiving it is presumed to be Park, but we only got this shot from his back. Why is Park protecting Cha? Cha is a small fish compared to Na, and not as meticulous. And he puts up with Park. Which means, with Na locked up, Park can do whatever he wants, with Cha as his front. Cha has been expanding to the Japanese market when Na got out. This is our chance to get Park. Who's the victim? The customs agent whom Park put in front of the media. Son of a... Which way? Jesus! Out of the way. What are you doing? Park, you're amazing. You used a man's life as a bait for your case. Pardon? What happened? It must be Na Young-bin. He was released recently, and started cutting his tails. Everything's Na to you, what about Cha? I heard he's flexing his muscles overseas. I was told that Cha's clan has been disbanded. So you're cleaning up the mess out of pure sorrow? Chief Han. If it wasn't for us, you wouldn't have known about Na's return. If you're gonna eat my crumbs, do it quietly. Are you serious? I've had it with you! Come on! It's barely been a month since Na got out. Sort this out before shit hits the fan, got it? Of course, sir. Bring me something to lock him up for good! Yes, sir. I'll give you 10 days. Sir. I've assigned you to Park's unit. Remember, you can never be exposed. Det. Choi Min-jae? Chief's desk over there, captain's over here. And this is yours. Thank you. Put your bag down and report in. Yes, sir. My name is Choi Min-jae. Good to meet you all. Here. Investigation expenses, absentee logs. - Good luck! - I'll do my best, sir. Good! What'll help you adapt and endure here? In the end, it's men. No matter how difficult things get, the man beside you will help. I'll remember that, sir! Wait, hold up. We have to head out soon, cuff this fat bastard up, he might wake up later. Don't have a pair yet? Not yet, sir. This bastard's a weirdo. Wait! Who's this asshole? Sing a song. Like this? Then just stand there. Make sure to dance too, don't spoil the mood. Go on. Uh, all right. I'll do my best. One, two, three, four! ♪ Be careful of those cherry lips ♪ - ♪ Be careful of those... ♪ - Stop, stop, stop! - Good morning. - Sir. Salute. You should continue. You know those passport counterfeiters? They opened up a shop in Ahyun district. - Make note of it. - Thank you, boss! Damn... Choi Min-jae, you're with me. Pardon? You'll keep him around? Hey, hey, hey! - Stay with him. - Okay... Get changed first. Come on. Sir? Drive, Cheongdam district. Yes, sir. Deputy Manager Choi. Me, sir? Wanna be 'Supervisor'? No, chief. Don't call me that, call me 'boss'. Don't sound like a cop out here. Yes, boss. Okay, give me a rundown of you. Yes, boss. Born in 1990, majored law, graduated the academy in 2015, worked in Major Crimes before my transfer here. My hobbies are judo, tennis, currently single. I knew your father. My father? We had a history. I didn't know. My boss is out at the moment... Good to see you, Mr. Kwon. You startled me... Why did you suddenly... Who is he? You'll get to know him. I'm Kwon Ki-ahn. Choi Min-jae, deputy manager. You're a cutie with terrible manners. You got a bark in you. Na didn't contact you? I cut all ties with him, you know that. I got coffee, have some. What's Na's product? Something new? Don't be like that, I really don't know. Several men are dead, including a customs agent. My company thinks it's a big case. If you don't cooperate, it'll get difficult for you. When I think about that asshole, I feel like shit, that's all... I heard the business was bad, you got into retail too? What's with you today, you're embarrassing me! What's got into you... You're under arrest for illegal substance abuse. Mr. Choi, could you step outside? But chief... Go outside. I really don't know anything about some customs agent... I only heard that he was gathering potential investors. Money? He needs money? I heard he bought an expensive license to a new technique. It's expensive enough to buy Major Leaguers. I'm serious, that's all I heard. Please believe me, look at my eyes, please! Okay, understood. Are we gonna overlook his needle marks? We don't go after small timers. Kwon may be a junkie, but he's got good ears. It's better to use him as an informant. Did you receive the key? She changed it to a keypad, 28487898. Asshole. Don't be scared, I drank a barrel when I got in. Stay frosty. So? Was it cool accompanying \the chief? I'm not sure yet. Where did you go? A furniture shop in Cheongdam. So you were there when he met his informant? Yes. Kiddo, the thing about informants is, you don't tell anyone about them. Not even your wife. Do you know what I'm saying? I'm so jealous! Hazing is still a thing? It's a tradition, sir. It's been too long since we got a new member. All right, let's drink. Go! - Go! - Go! For Unit 3! Go on, kiddo. Here. Grow some balls. You still got a long way to go. Pour! Get over here. You're driving. Drink! 17:20, Cheongdam furniture shop. A front for loan shark Kwon Ki-ahn. Park let his substance abuse slide, to presumably receive intel on Na. Considering Park and Kwon's relationship, a partnership with Cha is feasible. 21:05, arrived at Banpo home. Thanks. Come here starting tomorrow morning. Okay, good night. Good night. 170cm wide. 170... - 125cm long. - 125? That's the window measurement without the frame. Depending on his shoes, there may be some discrepancies. Between 184 and 185. Between 184 and 185... Height: 184.5cm And his ear... This is close to a 90% match. It's hard to be this close. Yes, sir? Where are you? I'm almost there, sir. Come up when you get here. The passcode is my license plate. Yes, sir. - You're here? - Sir. I'm gonna wash up, so change into that. Right. - Size okay? - Yes. - You look good in it. - Thank you. Are we going somewhere in this? Isn't it obvious? To work. Consider it your work uniform. Grab these jackets and a watch too. But sir... Too much? My salary is hardly enough to buy any of these... It's from the top, so don't worry. The top? Let's call them key players of this society. Including a few Metro Police brass. No need to feel nervous, just focus on work. Chief, could I change my tie? Pick whatever you want! Na Young-bin Why do we need suits to catch criminals? Never faced the super rich? They only deal with top 1% of society. You can't go near them in a jacket you wore earlier. Why do we take that into account? We have to meet them to catch them. They use money to keep us far away. Without a warrant, you can't even get close. Consider it your uniform. Yes, sir. Mercedes was paid entirely in cash. One-year lease and deposit for luxury apartment paid in cash, funding source unconfirmed. Sir, you can't park here, move along please. I'm an on-duty officer. I've never seen a police Mercedes, sir. Pardon me. He's a cop. (Vehicle Restoration) Any usable leak from Na's end? A few days ago, one of Cha's cars was totaled and brought in. It's true that Cha is working with Yakuza. He must be trying to push out Na for good. If there's no game in town, he will create one. Send me this photo, got the plate number too? Sorry for everything and thank you. - Take care. - See you. No contact with Cha yet, but the man in the photo is presumed to be Park. Na's investigation is carried out alone. So is the Sgt. Lee murder case, and his team is left out of the loop. A private safe was found in his study. Contents unknown. I'll submit a separate report in the future... Could I take your... Na was released recently. So how much more do you need? $500,000 should do. This year's expense rose quite sharply. Is it because Na causing problems? He's a poisonous fungus. I know you're doing your best. And you're right, he's a poisonous fungus. He must be removed before he spores. Yes. He jacked up the cover, and raised the barrier. I'll use the money for the informants, and cut down my investigation expenses. No, you have a reputation to maintain. Sponsorship is there to be spent on the field. I'll talk to the elders and send it right away. My apologies... It's quite all right. So it is from higher ups... But why'd a cop... Chief Park Kang-yoon Yes, chief. Sorry to bother you on the weekend, but I need your help. Right away, sir. Good to see you. What you asked for. It's nice to see you so often. If you miss the deadline, get me a gun, okay? Kidding. Whenever you need money, make sure to call me first. - Drive. - Yes, sir. Oh yeah, I got a gift for you. This has a discreet camera and you can record the footage on your phone, the quality is incredible. I gave it a spin, it's stunning! You'll feel like a spy, James Bond! Forget the gift, put it on my tab. Catch plenty of bad guys! Salute! Boss... Should you borrow so much from a loan shark? Why? Scared that you'll get shit stained? I can pay back quickly, watch and learn. But even so that much is... Investigation Unit had a cop named Sgt. Lee Myung-ju. The murdered cop? The perp who stabbed him is supposedly inside. Under Na's roof, cool, huh? Is that true? It was an expensive intel. If it's wrong, I'll fuck up the informant. Isn't there a membership to these events? Guess how much. $30,000 maybe? Depending on credit $200,000 to 600,000 annually. A non-member cover is $20,000 for a day. We're closed today. I'm not here for the club, I came to see Mr. Na. It's a private event. If you do not have a warrant, please move along. Piss off. Walk away while you can. Here, cover fee. I came to play poker, he's my bodyguard. Chief Park is coming in. Mid-30s, about your height, he has a scar on his right ear. I'll be at the poker table. Scan Na's associates and slip out to the back. Text me if you find him. I understand. Mr. Na, it's been a while. As you can see, the table's full. So I should just go? But we're friends. I'll wait. I fold. I fold too. Fold. Mr. Kim, leaving already? Jesus Christ... Terrible manners. Sit if you're gonna play poker quietly and leave, or piss off. He's heading up. Oh my... Mr. Na. Too bad for you, Det. Park. Jang, did you suck him dry? Bring me some more chips. $50,000 It was great today, thank you. No, this is expensive stuff... I can't wait any longer. I'm sorry. It's all right. ...a scar on his right ear. Found him. Okay, thank you. My, my. Mr. Na, what are you up to nowadays? Give me a business card. I don't have stuff like that. I'm officially unemployed. I heard you started a venture business. I got bad credit, no money whatsoever. It sounds so awkward to hear that you're penniless. Give me your phone number. I'm told this is a cordial event. No reason not to give me yours. Happy? Remember him? National ID: Lee Man-seok Lee Man-seok, you're under arrest for the murder of Lee Myung-ju. What are you doing? You're guests here. Touch me again, I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice. Are you thugs or cops? Hey, that's enough. Pull your men back. Let them go. He confessed. Motive? It looks to be a simple robbery. No gang affiliation and no known grudges. An inspector was killed in a simple robbery? And the perp's employer is Na Young-bin? Not feeling well? Get someone else? No, sir. Get him to fess up by Monday morning. Understood, sir. Det. Choi! Good work. So Intelligence Unit 2 chief is providing the funds? Yes, if the fund source is internal, I don't know if it's a cause for concern. And Sgt. Lee's killer, Chief Park caught him himself. That's more suspicious. Why? This is confirmed to be Park, right? Yes. Aside from the sponsorship, prove that he took Cha's dirty money. Didn't you say he borrowed money from Kwon too? We need irrefutable evidence, rather than suspicion. What you see isn't everything. It's an intense speed boat race! Of the 6 boats, #3 and #5 are leading the charge! #3's Bae and #5's Kim, they're on their final lap! #3! Come on! #3 vs. #5! It's close! #3! The gap with the pack is widening! They turned the final corner, #3's Bae Hyemin and #5's Kim Jong-min! They're fast approaching the finish line! Come on! Catch up! #3 and #5 are at the finish line! Neck and neck race ends with #5 on top! Come on! Please keep your ticket until the final decision. Boss, didn't we finish first? - #3. - #3! Yeah, Bae Hyemin! We did it! We won! I saw him finish first. Can we have a feast tonight? No can't do, gotta repay my debt first. The gambling debt from Kwon? Better me than gamblers here, so the money is used for the public good. Over there. Loan repaid in full. No evidence of bribery or conspiracy with Kwon. No defraudation for personal gain found. No proper contact with Cha. Chief! Is this also part of your sponsorship? No, this is my treasure #1 with a 20-year loan. I'm going to live here when I retire. I'll float around and fish for life. It's a bit small for that. I'll have less physical and material baggage by then. A sleeping bag, dishware, a camping stove and booze. Be careful. Holy cow! Cool, huh? Whoa! That's what I'm talking about. - Chief. - Yeah? You said you knew my father. You really don't remember? What do you mean? Dad! Dad! Dad! Let me go! That's my dad! No! Stop! I never thought you'd become a cop. I was so proud of him when as a kid. But... after those incidents... I became suspicious of him... And resented him for letting it happen. So I wanted to know what being a cop entailed. When I transferred to Bangbae it was January. An old drug addict froze to death by the police station wall. It was my father. An addict and an ex-con. He probably came looking for me. I was so ashamed of him that I held his funeral without ever telling my colleagues. I don't know how he found out, but he came to the funeral. Sgt. Choi Dong-su. That's who your father was. Just don't become a cop. Never. Can I ask you more about him? Don't rush it, I'll tell you little by little. Nothing's biting, let's call it a day. Name: Park Kang-yoon Seoul Metro Police Investigation Unit Final Report ...no evidence of embezzlement, or illegal slush fund for investigation... Na Young-bin These are videos of Na's investor meetings. Cross reference it with today's attendees, ID everyone you can. Once verified, figure out their relation to Na, criminal records, financials, recent business transactions, and any notable figures they're in close contact with. Most importantly, get their numbers. Report to me when you do. Yes, sir. I need to get my stuff, stand by here. Yes, sir. Section Chief Hwang Something wrong? No, behind us... It's probably nothing. Back it up. You're charged with violation of code of conduct, get out. Give us a tour of your home. I heard you're well off. Why not. Sir. What's going on? I wrote in my report that there aren't any problems. I'm the one who decide. Don't worry, I'll make sure you're not exposed. So? Should we open it, or will you? Open it. What the hell? There are only contracts. Okay, we're done here, take him away. This way. Who's your source? I've told you already. I received sponsorship. From whom? Yeonnam Association? Sir, can you take the heat? I could never take heat for that much money. That money can't be clean. Is there such a thing as clean money? I have no problem stripping your uniform immediately. But one man behind bars isn't good enough. I'm going to uproot your entire organization. Sure, do your thing. Sponsorship? Right, they really like to spurge. But don't you know they'll use you and toss you out. You're just a prop to them. You'll use that money to catch criminals? Those who ignore principles and laws and accept dirty money are corroding the entire police organization. You're a disgrace to all the honest cops. Do you actually think what you're doing is just? I don't care what others think, cops are only cops when we catch perps and close cases. I heard you let your child's killer walk free. You fucking trash! Listen. Let's just do our jobs. I'll stick to investigation, and you pretend to be a cop, and go after hard-working police officers, got that? You are a tumor. You must be removed with a scalpel. Try it, if you can. Sir, you got a phone call. Let's see how long you remain on top. - Back? - Yes, sir. What happened? Uh, the thing is... they ambushed us, so... That's all? Yes... Call me with updates. Yes, captain. Choi Min-jae. If you were by his side, you should've watched him. Right... It'll be in the 2nd report. Financial, call records, wiretaps, we gotta be thorough, sir. Laying down the charge won't be a problem. We're close to uncovering the Yeonnam... What exactly is the reason?! My apologies, sir. But this time we have to... Choi Min-jae Come to the diner, contingency meeting Ma'am, could you leave us? Get the shutter. What are you up to? Did something happen? Why do you think we called you here? Hur, stay out of this. Come here. Min-jae, let me ask you a serious question. We're not 100% certain, but there's a rumor going around. Are you the mole? Why can't you talk?! Are you the mole who backstabbed our chief?! Asshole, is that true? Search him. One second... Bastard... Your fingers will break. Let go! I'll break them! What's going on? They worked us. It looks like Internal Affairs planted him. Everyone out except Min-jae. Let's go. What was the reason? Promotion? It's nothing like that. So? What are my charges? I concluded my report with no charges laid. Let me ask you something. Internal Affairs and my orders contradict. Who will you follow? Listen, you're in my team and we are a unit. So you just have to follow my order. Even if it breaks rules and deemed illegal? Going after perps can't be illegal, no matter the situation and method. It's about choosing to become a real cop, or a bureaucrat. There will be a time you'll be forced to choose. I'll follow the call of the police. This does not change you and I. But things will be difficult at the office for a while. My report won't have any effect? Chief paid Kwon back in full. Or is there other charges that I don't know about? Park's charges... Are you protecting that bastard? Sir. Did you know Park served under your father? I knew. What about his mother, who committed suicide? Your father locked up Park's father for substance abuse, and his mother killed herself from the shock. Did he tell you that? Your father checked in on him while he was in the system. Maybe he felt responsible, or sympathetic. When Park became a cop, he joined your father's team. Like a foster son. As promised... your father's record. Sgt. Choi Dong-su Investigation Report Joined Yeonnam, a Private Organization Within the Police Superintendent Seo Joong-ho It was your father's. Ever heard of Yeonnam? What is that? It started when Yeonnam district was established in Western Seoul. There was a time when cops took donations to investigate. They didn't even have gas money to do their jobs. Police agency was shit poor. When they had to travel without any money, they were still expected to perform. Some cops gave up and let criminals go, while others spent their own money to investigate. That's how Yeonnam got started. They gathered sponsors, donations and managed them, it became an organization operating in secrecy. In other words, it's illegal. At first their work produced results and praises. But still water is bound to rot. The donation pooled to be spent on investigation became allowances and slush funds, and they took bribes for going easy on syndicates. Stop it! Later, it became hard to discern cops from criminals. Your father and Park were prime examples. In other words, he created Park. Breaking laws and acting without oversight, he learned them all from your father. That can't be. I hear your father became a junkie too. Dad! - Dad! - No! Dad! So many needle marks... I'm sorry to say, it's true. Undercover methods back then were very primitive. The best cover was to become an addict himself. His killer was a Yeonnam affiliate, until he became an addict. If your father wasn't murdered, he'd have shared the same fate. With enough support, they want absolute obedience. Before the media got ahold of this story, Yeonnam was covered up internally. Then someone lit the fire on Yeonnam again. Park was the fire starter. Is that why you sent me? You calculated that Park'd take me in because I'm Choi Dong-su's son? Without digging into the soil, one can't uproot the weed. I'm done with this, do what you will. Who do you think led your father to his demise? It's Yeonnam. Park is ripe for picking. Na is no easy foe, and the sponsorship alone can't lead to his arrest. Next step is obvious. Cha is his ace in the hole, and he will use it soon. Think carefully. This is our last chance to right the wrong. Choi Min-jae, you're a cop, don't forget that. Prove that you're not like your father. Get over here at once, starting stakeout Yeah, I understand. Got it, good work. Please! I'll pay you back within this month! If you got money to burn, you gotta pay me back first. If you splurge on everything, when will you pay back? You still managed to send kids overseas to study. Them, right? No, not that, please, I can't! I really can't! Please, don't do this! Will you look at that... You made 2 calls to Na each time. Is it against the law to call him? Of course not. Then why are you doing this? You have an illegal loan business at gambling dens, and opened up shops to sell drugs to youths, and facilitated sex trade, those are illegal though. This is abuse of police authority! Filthy piece of shit. Did you bring a warrant? You didn't? Listen up. You said Na started a venture, what exactly is that? What? What are you talking about? - What the hell?! - Hold on, asshole. Hold still, you son of a bitch! If you move, you'll lose your chin. Can't you let me in on the secret? Stay the fuck back. That's enough, chief. If you get in my way, it means you can die by my hands, got that? Yes, venture! You're so right! He's starting a venture! Let me tell you about it! He's producing drugs! - Producing drugs? - Drugs! - Here?! - In Ansan! - You sure?! - I'm sure! Chief, it sounds legit. What happened was, I attended Na's investor meeting. What he said was fantastic. It was a sexy proposition. You may all know already, you'll take home as much as you put in. Whether intentional or not, if you leak anything, you and your family will be in great danger. All right. Let's start with samples. The ingredients have been approved. When they mix with caffeine in coffee, that's when you get high, it's revolutionary. Na bought the rights to the mixing technique. To regulate this psychotropic drug, it'll take at least 3 years. Why? It's hard to tell whether this powder alone is a drug. When mixed with coffee, there's no odor at all. That's why he disguised it as a coffee roaster. It's the perfect front. If it's distributed all over, kids get high while drinking coffee and hanging out. Getting a warrant is impossible. It's legal in a constitutional country. Detective, I'll stitch you up in no time. Yong, you'll have to help us. You're a funny guy, you want me to die? Or rot away for 5 years. You can't handle the cover. How much? $2 million is my cut. It's not much compared to others, but I got off the bandwagon. I got no cash to spare. So? Will you front the cover? Yes. Dad. Just don't become a cop. What, man? Shit, you're so childish... There are other ways to catch a mole. Goddammit... So what then? - Drop the case. - What? Wait, sir! Authorized Personnel Only What can you do with a rejected warrant? Who's blocking this? What are you implying? You got no evidence, it's all based on a testimony. It'd be strange if a warrant was issued. So who's the one blocking this warrant? Jesus... All right, then submit a report on how you got this intel. We got a lead... about passport counterfeiters leaving for the Philippines. Why don't you take on this case? We got a quota to fill. Let's get the counterfeiters first. MOLE Head to Namsan. It'll be tough this time. Is something wrong? We received an order. Can't I get a partial funding? It's not about the money, but a problem of will. Just like rejecting the warrant? That's the situation we're in. Is it because of Chairman Kim's son? All households have a problematic child. No amount of scolding will do the trick. With some time, he'll pull out. But it'll stir trouble if you ambush them now. Look the other way on this, you got bigger things to do. No. A new type of drug could flood the country in no time. If they hit hard and pull out, there won't be a next time. Park Kang-yoon. You're being dramatic. The decision has been made. Chairman Kim is Yeonnam's biggest supporter. Cheongdam furniture shop. - To Kwon's office? - Yeah. For operation fund? I'll use it to get in, then return it. By winning the speed boat race? I can do far worse. Drive. Yo, where's Kwon? He's abroad. He took off running? No, he travels abroad regularly... You laugh? Did you just laugh? Huh? Are we some kind of thugs! Is Cha the only option left? Watch your mouth. What about Yeonnam? They won't back you? Yeonnam? Is that what Hwang fed you? Come on, chief. One must find a rightful option, why must you resort to an illegal option? Can we do our jobs without getting our hands dirty? Are you saying nothing is illegal when going after criminals? What exactly is the call of the police you speak of? Listen up. Us cops are always standing over the boundary. We can't be black nor white. - Is that even possible?! - It is! So long as people support our work, we can stand above the gray zone. At times, they will push us towards the black. That's being a cop. If you can't do that, just quit. That's just it! This is precisely why my father didn't want me to be a cop! Yeah? That's weird. He suggested that I become one. A cop who could move the world. So Na is finally going down. Damn. I couldn't even shit properly because of that bastard. A few days ago, my fortuneteller said I'll live a long life. That's fine and all, but he said I'll outlive Na. So I asked him how he knew that. He said he saw Na's fortune too. Fucking hell. What do you think I did? What did you do? I buried him! What are the chances of him seeing both me and Na? I got the chills and thought maybe he was trying to bury me. Have you forgotten, asshole? I'm a cop. Why? Gonna lock me up? Go ahead. I'll have to get your loan back from jail then, bro. Don't call me that. Bring it. I put a GPS tracker on the bottom of the bag. Choi, come with me. Give this to him. Fine, after this job, leave my unit. Go back to your team, good? Oh my. Good job putting together $2 million. Protect that money. If we don't recover this, we're all dead. The rabbit is going in. Copy, standing by. Choi Min-jae. I expect big things. I had some money stashed away! Perfect timing, huh? $2 million! Out? Safe, just barely. Safe! Safe... The rabbit is inside. I'll now activate the machine. Raising both of your hands will be our signal. Signal us only after the final product is out. No mistakes. Boss, cops are here! Park Kang-yoon, that asshole... Turn the machine off. Pardon? Turn it off. Yes, right away. Attention please. It's the police. Easy, don't worry. You'll now witness your top dollars at work. They're simply imported coffee ingredients, right? - Yes. - That's right. Cops don't have a warrant. No evidence either, right? But why is the police coming? All units, we got the signal. Move in, move in! Go. Son of a... Bring him. Come on, Mr. Na! Can't I adjust my hair?! Don't move! - Everyone freeze! - Stay where you are! Get back in! Now! Don't move! Against the wall! Stand against the wall! Show me your warrant. Na Young-bin, you're under arrest for production of an illegal substance. What illegal substance? This isn't drug... Det. Ahn. Chief, nothing came out yet. Switch it on. Yes, sir. It's got a passcode lock. Where's the code generator? Who knows... Where the hell is it? You son of a bitch. Don't move! I swallowed it, asshole! Do Not Enter Wait till I shit it out tomorrow! Get back! Don't move! - Det. Ahn. - Yes, sir. Who are you? Stab him! That bastard saw my face, stab him! Chief Park - Arrest him. - Yes, sir. Buddy. You made that yourself, don't forget. Come on out. See you again. Get over here. Chief, I don't see Min-jae. The entry was chaotic... Hey, Choi Min-jae! Min-jae! You okay? Are you all right? Get up! He's conscious, get the EMT! Yes, sir! Lee Myung-ju... Lee... Ear... What? Chief! Sir... The rabbit is gone. A drug producer disguising narcotics as coffee was arrested. Over $100 million in cash was found on the scene, and the police is focusing on the source of this money. Drug Org's Connection to Daeho Group Heir I told Park not to stir trouble. He wasted our business funding. It's likely he took money from the Yakuza. The Internal Affairs is digging into us due to this incident. Park Kang-yoon... I don't know how to thank you. Not at all, sir. We should've paid more attention, my apologies. Since this case is related to the death of an officer, the Internal Affairs is keeping eyes on it. Chairman, I'm sorry to bring this up but... I was thinking of sending him to Europe somewhere... Yes, I'll make arrangements. It's time to dump Park. Cha Yes? Yo, bro! Come by! We gotta celebrate Na's grand exit! I told you not to call me that. It's a cause for celebration. Is it because of the runaway money? Yakuza is already talking about gutting you, I'm barely holding them back. Bro, I got a proposition that'll wipe away your debt. You won't be able to refuse. I heard you're getting a medal. You're a made man. Hardly. This is what you asked for. The knife wielder who was charged with Sgt. Lee's murder. He had a scar when I arrested him, but not in the photo. The fucker who stabbed me also had that the scar. And Sgt. Lee's killer, Chief Park caught him himself. That's more suspicious. For operation fund? I can do far worse. If you get in my way, it means you can die by my hands, got that? Hey, what are you doing? Where will you go? Yes? Tick, tock, time's running out. I know. I thought you couldn't come out because of a rat outside your place. Who? The kid you hung out with, he's guarding the door. You should've called ahead. How are you feeling? Fine, sir. That's good. The guy who stabbed me at the factory... had a scar on his earlobe. And this is the perp we caught at Na's gambling joint. This was taken only a month ago. He doesn't have the earlobe scar. And he's in final stage of cancer. He recently received a large deposit to his account. So? Sgt. Lee Myung-ju... You killed him. And to cover up the murder, you created a fake, and arrested him. No? If I tell you, will you believe me? What about the $2 million you took from Cha? I saw you taking it at the port. That's my debt to repay. So how exactly will you do that?! If you cannot pay back, you do it with your life. You sure you weren't in bed with Cha? Are you bugged? Hold still! Go home. You took out Na for Cha to take over the turf, no? Choi Min-jae. Learn how to see the world properly first. No one in my unit joined me to stuff their pockets. No, speak for yourself! A cop must stand above the gray zone? You've already fallen in the black muddy water. The world will not stand with you this time. Okay, I'm the evil. But I will lock up those who are worse than me, only then I'll quit this, so mind your own business. Got that? No, you won't be able to. I'm going to stop you. Don't resent me, you started this. Who's that? Who are you? Hey! Answer me! Welcome! A $2 million gig won't be a cake walk. Go to these coordinates, pay the money and get the stuff. Now that you confirmed it, I'll take your phone. They'll cut the power, and contact you with this. Thanks to your intel, coast guards and narcos won't come near here. I got a present for you there. What are you doing? You know what's inside. Hey! Stop! That's enough! Give me the key. He's probably not your illegitimate son, why are you protecting him? It's obvious he's buying his time to backstab you. I'm getting rid of him for you. Give me the key! What's with you? You're in a bind because you won't clean up your shit... Buddy. Buddy. You got shit for brain? This is the west sea. By morning with the tide gone, everyone will see that car. And a body is found in the trunk, whom I beat up and put in. If I'm labelled a cop killer, I won't be able to work. Maybe I'll wrap it all up here. Or pull him out. All right. You're a prickly one. Look at that bastard! Uh, bro? This is what it comes to? Delivering drugs to pay back your debt? Chief, it's not too late to give this up. Don't be cute in front of me. There's so much money here, how much are you bringing in? If a police chief is delivering, wouldn't you try to get as much as possible? Choi Min-jae. I'm giving this to you so that you don't get killed. Until I give you an order, stay here like a ghost. Got it? No matter what. Chief. I can't be responsible if you get yourself killed. Remember, stay down, got that? Boss, should we check the money first? Hey. Fucking pay me. Count properly. Police! Police! Why isn't that bastard coming back? Go check it out. Yes, boss. Chief! Stop! You fucking bastard! Nobody move! Drop your weapons and surrender! This is the narcotics! I say it again, drop your weapons! Where are you going?! Goddammit! What are you gonna do with that? You son of a bitch! Dammit! Get me Park Kang-yoon! Park! Get him down here! Can I help you? When we arrest Na, slip out with the bag. And lay low until I call you. Chief Park Kang-yoon asked me to drop this off here at 11 PM. $2 million, not a single bill missing. It's exactly 11 PM. Park, that bastard... Police! I'm a cop! Chief, chief! Over here! Get me a stretcher! Chief, is this fun? This is the sweetest moment. I told you to stay down. Chief! Sir! This kid's not obedient, go educate him properly. All right, thanks. - Take care of him. - Yes, sir. Who's that? Park Kang-yoon, you're under arrest. There's been some misunderstanding, we're wrapping up another case, and making arrests here. I understand, do your thing. On what charges? For fabricating a suspect for the death of Sgt. Lee Myung-ju. Wait a minute, sir. You can explain this, right? Lt. Park Kang-yoon, you're under arrest for evidence tampering among others. You have the right to retain a lawyer, blah blah blah... you know the drill. Got anything to say? Take him away. Wait a minute! Stop! Chief! This doesn't make any sense! Chief! Park was arrested for suspect fabrication. We switched Chairman Kim's slush fund account to his. I made sure Internal Affairs won't dig in any further. Did Chairman Kim's son fly out? Yes, sir. It's too bad about Park. Visitation Request: Park Kang-yoon Chief. I... should have consulted you first... It's okay. You were right to be suspicious. You didn't order the suspect fabrication. I didn't but I'll become the fall guy for it. It's my fault as well, Na was too good of a prey. That's why I bit down. You can't always win. You sometimes lose some. And get backstabbed too. I did more than enough. No regrets either. When I get out of here, I'm done catching bad guys. I'll live my remaining days fishing instead. That's good. By the way, about my boat, I didn't get to put it away since I was rushed in here. There was a storm recently. Could you go check if it's doing okay? Sure. Plants send a signal before roots rot. Leaf tips turn yellow like this, or they shed leaves. Park was tossed out like that. You know that he didn't do it. That's not important. It's about whether or not the root is rotting. It's up to you to decide how you determine it. Sgt. Choi Dong-su Investigation Report Suspect Profile: Jeon Yong-bae - A new addition? - Yes. Welcome. Didn't you come with Chief Park some time ago? I'm the son of Sgt. Choi Dong-su, whom you killed. It's Jeon Yong-bae, Choi Dong-su's son will come by. You worked for Park? Yes, I did. So? What's this about? I would... like to meet the man on top. What are you talking about? He'll surely come if it's about my father's case. If there's no way from inside, I'll have to find a way from outside. That'd ruffle a lot of feathers, no? Is that a threat? No, sir. It's been a while. Yes, sir. You asked for me? What's this? It's a report on my father Choi Dong-su, and former officer and his murderer. (Testimony of Jeon Yong-bae) Jeon Yong-bae's testimony. It details activities of Yeonnam-sponsored officers, and injustice suffered by field officers from those activities. There are other testimonies and evidence as well. Testimony? It's still just hearsay. You do not have any irrefutable evidence. It won't get past arraignment. Details of the report are quite powerful, and the media will latch on to it, turning it into a scandal. Yeonnam sent Kim Jung-gyun to Europe. I've secured evidence that he contracted a hit man, and figured out his escape route as well. You wanted to ask for a favor. You've grown up well. You're fiercer than your father. Siheung Penitentiary Buddy! What have you done? I'm not sure. Don't you always go by the book? Sure. But I might do this until I catch all the bad guys worse than me. Boss. Should we head to Hapjeong district first? A new drug from Thailand flooded the market there. Okay, Deputy Manager Choi. - Drive. - Sure thing. So I hear Kim fled to Europe. You've been gathering intel even in prison? European business trip sounds good? Our bosses won't sign off on it... We'll get that after we return.
