I spent a lifetime learning how to paint like a little child. For my big little brother! Imagination is a great servant... - It's you! - In this house... Children shouldn't tell lies! We don't have secrets anymore. I need to tell you something as well. - Are you ready, captain? - No one is invincible! We're actually closed. No! Wait! I didn't know it was you. Well? Did you have a look around? Did you like the place? What exactly was it you were looking for? Ah! Stories? In that case you've come to the right place, come! This place is filled with stories! And every one of these objects could tell you dozens of them! Don't mind the dust, because behind this layer, a story is hidden and it still lives on. There's a past that is still here today. So? Let the journey begin! 1978 The mission. CAUTION, WORK IN PROGRESS. - What? - It's time to begin! It won't be easy to get into the control room. There'll be infrared rays and we need to avoid all closed circuit cameras. And if just one of these were to see us... I know, we'd need to abandon the mission. And once we're in the preparation room, we'll only have 30 seconds to throw the chemical inside the poison. At that point we'll wait for our unwitting ally. If everything goes well, the world will be saved. 30 seconds starting from... - Just like Sean Connery. - You mean Roger Moore. Come on Marco, we've had this talk so many times. Connery is the real Bond. - Roger Moore. - Sean Connery. - Roger Moore. - Sean Connery. Only Connery can say: "Bond. James Bond" - Yeah, but Luca... - What? Now! Ten! - When is he coming? - Shh, don't shout. - Yes but when is he coming? - Any moment now. - What? - Any... moment... now! Don't forget Marco. Patience is a 007 agent's number one virtue. - Is he here yet? - No! - Is he here yet? - No! - Is he here yet? - Does it look like someone's here? - What? - Does it look like someone's here? Don't shout! Here he is! - I'm home! - I'm in the kitchen! Do you think it'll all go according to plan? - Shh... don't shout! - Will it go according to plan? - Let's hope so. - What? Okay, okay, I got it. - What's this smell? - It's dinner. And it doesn't smell. It's a healthy pot of vegetable soup. Again? Didn't you just make it the day before yesterday? It was last week. You know vegetables are good for you. - But the match is on tonight! - First the soup, then the game. I can imagine how happy the boys will be! - Come on, I'll go call them. - No, wait! Taste it first! - Is it too hot? - I wish! It's way too salty! - How's that possible? - You added more by mistake. Let me go buy some pizza. You're right honey, maybe you should get four pizzas. 007 reporting: mission accomplished, over and out. Hang on, if you're 007, then who am I? - 008? - No, I want to be 007. - Come on, 8 is nice. - 7. - 8. - 7! - 8. - 7! - 8. - 7! - I said 8! The pizzas are here! Here I am... are the veggie pizzas for you? - Veggie pizzas? What!? - Oh yes. - I want the four seasons pizza! - I want pizza with ham! You know nothing gets past me. - Let's go. - Come on, the match is starting! Maybe your next mission will be more successful! The stadium is full, the captains reach midfield to exchange flags. We're all set for this spectacular match. The two teams reached the final thanks to their champions' feats. The teams respect each other, they'll fight for the final victory. We can clearly see the tension on their faces. - Captain, are you ready? - Paolo, don't call me captain. - Nervous, huh? - What do you think? It's the final. So? You're Danilo, the team's captain. You're also the top scorer in the League. Thanks Paolo, you really know how to help. - No problem, captain! - Look here! The fool and the hero. Hey! Danilo isn't a fool! Did you think this was going to be your big day? Let me give you some advice: avoid touching the ball. Don't even step on the pitch. Don't forget to use a compass so you know which way the goal is! - Do you think he'll kill us? - What's he doing here? Who, Bruno? He's in the opponents' team! - Did you know this? - Yes, so what? It's the best moment: the unbeatable Bruno will get to know the bitter taste of revenge. The first half is already over? Come on, we'll show them who we are in the second. Yeah... sure we will. - I think my spleen is gone. - Your spleen is on the other side. Exactly... it used to be on the other side! What are these faces I see? Guys, you're playing well, trust me. They haven't scored and that's fundamental. - But we can't score. Bruno is... - He's beatable! - The captain and I will make it! - I don't think so. Maybe you should replace me? Danilo... nobody is unbeatable. Let's go back there and show them what we're made of. Okay? Come on! Come on! Come on Paolo, now we... - Have you been replaced? - What? - Have you been replaced? - No, I don't think so. - I thought so. - Excuse me? The coach didn't replace you, right? That's because you were playing well. Sure, of course I was. You didn't give up. You tried and tried again. I think it's time for a little help. When I was your age, not to brag, but I wasn't a bad player. I know I don't look like one. When I was on the field, not one ball would pass by me. If I had... If I had this, I would play a great game! Take it. Hey! Young man! This is a captain's armband! - Take it, trust me. - Thanks, but... I have to go back, the second half is about to begin. You'll never be a great captain, if you don't become captain of yourself. The armband is a symbol for the team. Whoever wears it, is brave enough to guide the others. But most of all, whoever has the armband is able to guide himself. Take it, come on! Trust me. What were you doing in the bathroom this whole time? Too scared? What are you doing here? Come on, the game is about to start, let's go! Danilo, the ball! Are you ready to show them who we are? Of course, captain! We're the champions! We did it! I don't know how I did it. This armband must be magical. - You think? - Did you see what it made me do? - This armband is... - It's a common armband. Just a piece of cloth, no big deal. But... I... Exactly, you! You played well when you understood you could beat them. In order to become a champion, in life as well, you don't need an armband. You just need good lungs and especially this. You need to feel the air you breathe. There you go, that's it. Off you go... come on. Coach! Do you know that man? Riccardo? He actually began playing right here. - Then the war began and... - Why is he a caretaker? Caretaker? Who told you that? Riccardo is the owner of this pitch! He bought it a few years ago and completely restored it. He once told me, I want kids to start smiling again. I think he did it. Danilo! Come on, they're handing out the prizes! Go and celebrate with the others, you've earned it. - You can tell the spaceship is fake! - Shh! Don't talk so loud! - Kids, go to bed! - There you go. Yes mom, the movie is almost over. And we still haven't seen these damn aliens! - Maybe they're cute like E.T.! - No! They're invading Earth 2. They've got to be scary, just like in Alien. Is that the movie mom and dad won't let us watch? Exactly, that's really scary. There it is! - And you call that an alien? - Shh! Don't shout! - Kids, go to bed! - I knew it. Watch out, they could crash! I was so disappointed about the aliens and from where they came from. And not even an explanation on how they invaded Earth 2. Their weapons were laser guns and stupid fusion bomb grenades. Those spaceships were so fake! What kind of alien wears a tracksuit! Exactly, that was 20 years ago! It's not as good as the previous ones. - Forbidden Planet. - Spacetown. - The Day the Earth Stood Still. - Planet of the Apes. - 2001: A Space Odyssey. - Star Wars! Wouldn't it be cool if every movie would be... Sci-fi! Sci-fi! Always and only Sci-fi! What have we done to deserve this? Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was for your father and me? Do you get it? - But we... - Gianni... Didn't she ask us a question? - I thought so too. - Elena! - But... I can't imagine what dinner with your aunt will be like! Exactly, we all know how gossipy your sister is! - They'll find out in a flash! - What about your mother? Can you imagine if your grandmother finds out? - Was that a question too? - I think so. - But we... - No, don't even try! - Don't you dare! - I don't think it was a question. She'll say I'm not a good mother, that I can't educate my kids. - Do you realise how serious this is? - Don't answer. - Do you understand or what? - Watch out. See? They won't answer! Do you realise how serious this is or what? Actually... we don't. We didn't do anything! Nothing? I don't think the teacher's note is nothing. - You didn't do your homework. - But we did! - It's just that... - Sure, I know! You were attacked by aliens while going to school. And you lost your schoolbags while you were running from them. Kids, your stubbornness is just making things worse! - We're not making this up! - We really were attacked by aliens! - Kids, don't tell lies. - Mom... Lies might seem the best option to begin with, but they're not. Lying simply means postponing a problem. From now on, no more lies. I only want the truth, you can do it, right? - It'll be easy! - Telling the truth is so easy! Are you ready? Ouch! - Who did that? - Well... uhm... - So? - Help me. - Come on, you can do it. - Did you do it? - Yes, it was him. - Thanks! Yeah, it was me. - Luckily we hit you on the head. - Luckily? - Mom says you have a thick head! - Yeah, thick as a... - Thick as a brick! - Are you kidding me!? No... sometimes we do, but not this time. - What do you mean sometimes!? - When you sing under the shower! That's really funny. What have I done to deserve this? - Is this a direct question? - I don't know. - We never told lies! - We only told the truth! Yes, but you can't exactly say everything. There are some things, that despite being true, may offend people. Exactly. For example, your aunt, mom's sister... you can't say she's gossipy! It's true, but she'd feel bad about it! Yeah! And you can't tell your grandma that she's too overbearing and apprehensive, you'd hurt her feelings. Don't tell lies and don't say some truths because... Do you get it? - This time it's all clear. - We can't get it wrong. Hello? Hi grandma! Gianni and I are having a snack. Mom? Grandma, can I ask you something? If mom is here and doesn't want to talk to you, would you feel bad? Give me this... hello? Okay kids... Sometimes people say a few fibs. A half truth or an uncomfortable truth... Sure. I always say your aunt has the gift of gab. - But I never say she's gossipy. - Will you stop it with my sister? - And what about you and my mother? - I didn't say anything about her! You didn't even want to answer the phone. You run to the bathroom every time my mom calls! What can I do about it? She inspires me! - Was that the doorbell? - I think so. Next time answer the phone while I do something else. - No problem! - Do you think we should answer? She doesn't tell you that you're an inconsiderate father! - We're coming! - Stop right there! - We haven't finished yet. - You're still grounded! Did you get anything about this truth stuff? Not really. Who is it? Why aren't you answering? Oh... good evening. You two must be Elena and Gianni. I met the kids this morning as I was going to the sci-fi fair. It must have been the mask, but they saw me and ran away. And they forgot their schoolbags. These things are heavy. Good thing your address was on them. Sorry if I'm handing them in now, but I was really busy with the fair. I hope I didn't create any issues. Well, in this case, it's always best to have a good laugh, right? 1960 Investigation. Something terrible happened in this house today. Not again... What about that time the tools disappeared from the garage? - Or when the meatloaf went missing? - Honey! - I never found the culprit. - The culprit? Don't exaggerate. Uncle Gaetano took the tools without warning us. - You ate the whole meatloaf. - I didn't eat the whole thing! - I shared it with my friends. - Who says it wasn't you this time - as well, daddy? - Was it really you? Me? Oh please! Federica, turn the TV back on! - Are you sure? - Of course! Are you sure you're not the one hiding something? Me? I would've easily admitted it. Are you sure? I know you're on a strict diet. - Honey, don't believe him. - What about that stain right there? - Oh, it's nothing... - What is that? I know what it is. Cherry jam. So mom, this is what happened. Daddy was looking for something in the fridge. - Then you arrived. - Get your nose out of that fridge. We just finished eating 10 minutes ago! That's when you took advantage of his distraction. You carefully opened the cookie cabinet - and you took... - Okay, okay... I confess! I had a slice of pie. - Ah, you're eating behind my back! - It was a tiny piece! - I've got nothing to do with... - Who could tell? I can tell. It means it happened after and if I'm not mistaken... - you went in the kitchen after. - I can't remember. - I can't remember. - So mom left the kitchen, Franco arrived in that moment and went straight for the cutlery drawer. - Franco, where are the pickles? - In the cabinet down there. At this point, you were about to leave, but you had a bad idea. - You took a chair and stole... - It wasn't me! Plus, you can't say that. You don't have any proof. But I do. You were working on a science project this afternoon. You needed... these. Guess where I found them? In the sweets cupboard. - Franco! - It wasn't me! I wanted to play a joke, but once I was there... I saw the door open, I thought it was you so I ran away. But I didn't go back in the kitchen. So the culprit must be... you! Franco was on the chair while dad was looking for the pickle jar. Dad didn't notice that Gino took a pickle and brought it here. It can't have been him! Only two people are left: grandma. - And you. - Federica, you're making things up, - you're making assumptions. - I think this is what happened: you got up, you were still hungry, you saw the cupboard open and went for it! The chair was in the way so you put it back. No, dad would've just moved it an inch or two. - That's true. - It's late now, shall we sleep? There's work tomorrow and the kids need to go to school. - What's the big rush? - Nothing, it's nice, but... - Federica, go on. - Dad got up, still unsatisfied. He went back to the fridge, but this time he looked in the freezer. - And he found your ice-cream. - Did you eat my ice-cream? - It's the only sweet I can eat! - Sure, that and the pie. - It was a tiny piece. - At that point grandma went in. Grandma, can I have my snack back? Imagination is a great friend, but also a dreadful truth. The easiest solution is very often the most precise one. I love this game! This time it lasted two minutes shorter... two! - See! It wasn't me. I'd never do it. - Sure you wouldn't. You ate my ice-cream! There was hardly any left! - You probably finished it! - There's still a little bit. By the way... where's the spicy salami? The one Uncle Gaetano brought. Nope! I deserved this one! Wow, I love this video! Come on, back to homework, my parents are coming home soon. - What's the fifth answer? - Which one is it? - Highest mountain in Spain. - Hang on, let me see. - Teide. - Wikipedia says it's a volcano. - Aren't volcanoes mountains? - Dunno. I'll write Teide too. 2007 Confessions. Here's another one. Maybe a storm is about to begin. - Hey, what's up? - Nothing... I'm... Are you afraid of thunder? Don't worry! We're at home! 1, 2, 3... 3 divided by 3, it's 1 kilometer from here. - What is? - My dad taught me. It's easy. You count the seconds between the lightning and the thunder. Then you divide it by 3 and you know how far the bolt is. Come on, let's count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 6 divided by 3? 2. - See? It's moving away. - You must think I'm an idiot. No way! I'm worse than you, I'm actually scared of butterflies! Butterflies are just... just... Dunno! I have a secret. You know that white stuffed bunny I have? I always sleep with it. - I knew it! - I really had a sore throat. Well, at least we don't have any bad secrets. - Did I say something wrong? - No, it's not you. What is it then? I've been meaning to tell you this. Remember when you asked me to invite that guy to your birthday? - Who? Gianluigi? - Yeah. I was jealous, so I didn't invite him any more. - Oh, that's why he didn't come. - I'm so sorry... I don't know what got into me, I immediately felt guilty about it. - Don't worry about it. - I meant to tell you, I swear. I'm telling you not to worry! Look... I have something to say too. - The problem is their defence... - I know, but... - Hi dad! - Hi honey! - Put your stuff away, we need to go. - We haven't finished, - can't you wait 2 minutes? - Grandma's coming for dinner! You know how she is. Come on, we need to hurry. What were you about to say? That thing about me? - Oh, yeah... - Are you ready? Come on! You've been together all afternoon, you'll see each other at school. Come on, grandma's coming. Bye Maria! - Bye. - Come on, we'll be late. What did you want to tell me? - Hi! - Did you have to come late? - Tell me that thing! - Look, we're late... - It's nothing... - Just tell me anyway! - Okay... I, uhm... - Girls! Still here? Go to class! - Just a second... - It's late! Go to your class! Come on! Go, go, go! - Good morning Lino. - Mr. Headmaster, good morning! Maria? - Maria? - Tanya! - Is something wrong? - No, no. If you don't tell me now, I'll go crazy! Please! Please! Please! Oreste? What's so interesting around you? Get back to work! Will you tell me or not? Please! Ok if you insist, then I'll confess. I really like you. Your Oreste. - What? - Tanya! I'm guessing you've finished, come and sit next to me. Come here, so the others won't lose their concentration. I have to go. Bye Gianluigi! Hi honey! How did it go? - Dad, please follow Maria's car! - What? Please, I need to speak to Maria! Okay, fasten your seatbelt. There they are, they've stopped at the traffic light. - They're going to the park. - Can't you reach them? I'll get there before them. - It's about yesterday, isn't it? - I can't get it out of my head. - It's not easy. - Did you do something terrible? - No, no, not me. - Who then? - You. - Me? - Let's say you did it unknowingly. - What do you mean? You told me you didn't invite Gianluigi because you were jealous. - You didn't want him at my party. - I'm so sorry. Don't worry. I didn't invite him because I like him, but because I knew you liked him, I wanted you to spend time together. So you invited him for me? What did you tell him today? - I invited him to the party. - But yours is in 7 months. Not mine, yours. He told me he'd be very happy to come. I asked him what he thinks about you. - And what did he say? - Dunno! I told you what you have to do, right? Wait for the lightning. There. Now count with me. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Anybody there? - And then? - Does she save herself? I still need to finish the story, but she has to save herself, right? She's the main character! Okay I'll do it myself, as always. What can I say? You never accept my ideas. - You wanted a ninja in the story! - Every great story has a ninja! - Are we shooting at your house? - Yeah! - How do we shoot the ghost scene? - With a bit of imagination. - What are you writing? - I'm organising Sunday's shooting. - Sunday? - Yeah. It's your mom's birthday! Everyone's coming! - Sunday morning? - What's all this whispering? We were just talking about Claudio's movie. The movie? How is the shooting going? Fine, we're almost done. Good. How about school? - All good. - All good. Claudio you know what I think, first comes school - and then all the rest. - I know, mom! An ignorant director will never be a great director. Claudio... I always have to do what she says, she never leaves me alone! Here it is! I finally found it! Does she tie you to a chair and torture you? - More or less. - Listen to me. They say God couldn't be everywhere at the same time... so He created mothers. Yeah, I know. I really understand your mom! - There's nothing to laugh about. - Not again! - It happens sometimes. - Just throw it out! Throw it out? You just need to move it a little bit. What do you know! Sometimes it gets jammed, the music is the same, but the record is still wonderful! Don't make that face! Let's get these done! Do you see the ghost? This is it! Well, it needs to be worked on, but with a bit of imagination - it becomes a real ghost! - I'll bring it all back on Monday. - Good, I might need this stuff. - See you on Monday! Sure! Why do we always have to do this? I don't remember how! This is the only thing I remember. - Then the explosion. - See you on Monday! Bye! See you! It's a fraternity thing. Is anybody here? Stop! Claudio please! We've done this scene 10 times! - What's the matter? - You don't know how to scream! And why do you always drop this thing on the floor? Can't we do it differently? How would you do it? My point exactly! Licia. Licia! Please, don't do that, please! Don't do that? We've been helping you with this movie for 3 months. We had fun, but most of all, we put up with you! You need to learn that in life you need to deserve the things you have, maybe with an honest "thank you" or "I'm sorry". I'm sorry. Is that okay? This needs to be fixed. Okay, bye Claudio! All is silence and peace, the world is still, there are no tidings now remained of them. Once in my boyhood, when so eagerly, we would look forward to the holiday. Finding it over, I lay upon my bed, wakeful and very unhappy, late at night a singing heard along the alleyways, little by little dying in the distance even as this does now, gripped at my heart. Who wrote these verses? Claudio... Leopardi. Leopardi! Exactly Claudio, just as Licia says. It's Giacomo Leopardi. Yet another terrible mark for Claudio and one for you too, Licia. Hi mom. Claudio, I spoke to your teachers today. - Claudio. - What? Honey... once, when your uncle and I were kids, - our grandparents took us... - I don't want to hear another story. - Fine. I'll take this then. - No mom, please don't! Claudio you're just a kid and you need to study. Why is everyone telling me who I need to be, what I need to do? - You just need to be a kid! - I don't want to be one! - Will you still make the movie? - No. - Elio get down from my bed. - Why? - Because you can't sleep up there. - Why won't you make the movie? Why do you want to grow up? I don't want to grow up anymore! - Why not? - Because I'm six! For children from 2 to 7. Do you want to know a secret? I still play with this. The funny thing is that maybe they're right. Of course. You're not always right! It's obvious that I'm not a grown up. I don't drive, I don't cook and I don't know how to live by myself! - I'd give anything to be 20. - Good golly! Where's the rush? Getting older isn't that much fun! - Why are you laughing? - Good golly is a bit old fashioned. - Relax, young man! - Young man too! I can't say young man or good jolly! I want to show you something. Come here. Do you know who this belonged to? It's mine. It's the first object I brought here more than 30 years ago. As soon as I see it, even just for a second, I become a child again. It's like a shock that runs through my entire body. This is the power of objects. They make you travel back to the past. And you live lives that weren't yours. Do you know what my mom used to tell me when I was sad? She used to say, don't think about now, think about when you'll become - a child. - Become? Become... because in the past, our entire future lies. - Did I go a bit too far? - I think so. I exaggerated a little... oh well, it happens, it's this thing! How much do I owe you for this? Get outta here! - No, it's like this. - Did I get it wrong? Oh well! - Thank you so much! - Thank you! For my big little brother. I found a new ending for the movie, but I really need your help! Please... Elena... Honey! You were right yesterday. If I want to grow up, I have to... stop pretending I'm already big. But... I'm afraid I'll forget what being a kid means. I just need one thing. Are you recording already? Do I have to look in the lens? Well... I was 8 years old, your uncle and I... saw an alien. I swear! We've all been kids. A grandfather who became captain of his life. A grandmother, who never stopped listening and observing. Imagination is a great servant. A mother and father, who before becoming parents, were the protagonists of small and great adventures! When you're little, everything seems big and possible. And then... you grow up. The world gets smaller. That's why in the scent of an object, in the colour of a toy or in the taste of a sweet, we should find the kids we've been and always will be. All the stories I listened to have become my story to tell.
