There it is. New Jerusalem. One of the most sanctimonious, clean livin' self-righteous buzzards on Earth. My old hometown. Well, what do we care, so long as they gotta bank and.. ...there's plenty money in it. Seems like a peaceful, unsuspecting little village. Almost a sacrilege to rob it. Well, what are we waiting for? Better get started, Pedro. Pedro is already there. Andale! - Come on, Doc. - Ho! Wonderful air, Gus. You can almost smell Christmas. Let's you and me take a trip some place after we clean out this bank. Somewhere where we can loaf good. That's what I need, a chance to loaf. Maybe some place where you can help that cough of yours. Doesn't need any help. Doing alright by itself. So long, Gus. So long, Doc. Last round, folks. We're closing down for the church social. We open again at 11:00. Well, you come to the best place, alright. Arizona's got a notorious climate. Lots of lungers come out here from the east and get well. Who said I was a lunger? Well, ain't you? That cough. No, no. No, I just smoke too many cigarettes. Don't sound just like a tobacco cough to me. Sounds deeper. I said it was too many cigarettes. Well, maybe. I guess I am just naturally a doubtin' Thomas. Comes from being the sheriff. I thought it came from your horoscope. Horos who? What's your birthday, sheriff? Uh, January 5th. Ah, then you were born under Capricorn. No, you got me mixed up, I was born under a tent. No, no, no. I'm speaking of the zodiac. Oh, them fellas. I've heard of them. They tell fortunes. You know, sheriff, Capricorn people are persistent doubters. Now, if I said yes, you'd say no automatically. Why, no, I wouldn't. Well, you see? There you go already. Well, I'll be. What else does them Capricorn fellas do? Well, they wait too long between drinks. My golly, that's right too. How's the old tooth, Ed? Fillings fell out. Oh, and I'll fix that for you in a jiffy. A little piece of bee's wax and.. - Ooh. - Oh. Now, wait a minute. You know, I, uh, I ought to fill this with.. But I ain't got time. Yeah, how's that? Fine. Hey, you sure are an A-1 dentist, Amos. Blackie, start slidin' out of them spangles. I ain't never been late to a church social yet. Have another drink, Amos. We're shuttin' down in a minute, mister. We open later. Don't pay me no mind. I'll be out when you close up. Last deal, sir. We'll resume play after the festivities. How many cards? Uh, three. I check. Pair of treys. Pair of knights. Well, that's the first smart call you've made all week. How come? - I just had a hunch. - Good. Psst-psst. Hey. Hey, mister. Thanks very much. Now, tell me. Why did you do it? Oh, I don't know. Guess I'm just a no-good rat. Going to the social, stranger? Ain't invited. This is a Christmas social, whole town's invited including strangers. Well, that's fine. Shake hands with mister.. - What was your name? - Oh, just call me Doc. Oh, a medical doctor? No, no. No, a doctor of philosophy. Ooh, special diseases. Meet mister, uh.. Gus Williams, horse wrangler and mule skinner from Las Vegas. - Pleased to meet you. - Same here. What's that you're rubbing in your hair, Ed, snake oil? Bear grease. It don't hardly smell at all. You'll just smell like a bear, that's all. Ready, sheriff? Alright, Amos. I gotta stop at the jail first. See you gentlemen at the social. Sure. Pleased to have met you, Las Vegas. Same here, special diseases. Hey, hey, hey. Say, say, mister, mister! Mister. I want you to take some of this money before I'll put it to the bank. Aah, I don't want none of your money, stranger. You put it all in the bank. - Reverend McLane? - Yes? Uh, this gentleman and I are strangers in town and the sheriff said... Why, of course. - 'Welcome.' - Thank you. Thank you. My name is Doc. And this gentleman's... Uh, Joe Moffat from up Cheyenne way. Been a prospector all my life but never hit pay dirt yet. Well, I'm glad to know you, Joe. Uh, this is my wife. Glad to have you gentlemen. Just make yourselves at home. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. It's extremely nice of you, ma'am to be so kind to strangers. I'll bet you're from New England. Why should you think that? Why, your voice. - The way you speak. - Oh. Well, as a matter of fact, I'm from Rutland, Vermont. I knew it. I'm from Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Is that so? Well.. - Strange we never met. - Yeah. Well, Blackie. Mother, I want you to know Ms. Blackie Winter. She works down at the bodega. Well, I.. I'm glad that you've come, my dear. I hope we ain't kept you from your business too long, Mr. Barrow. It's a pleasure, ma'am. The good of the community comes ahead of everything. Get away from that mistletoe, stupid. Gracious Father in heaven we have thy blessing 'in these gifts of thy love.' Amen. Uh, pardon me. I didn't just quite get your name, mister. Oh, I'm Dan McAfee from Carson City. Been a railroad man since I was ear-high to a jackrabbit. Oh. What's your line, miss, wife or mother? Oh, neither. I'm just a schoolmarm. Asparagus, Mr. McGillicutty? Folks, while it won't really be Christmas until next Friday. I wanna announce to you a very special entertainer. Just step in the library and meet Prof. Amos Snape. Step right in, folks. Quiet, please. Quiet. Quiet. My friends, the object of my little talk here tonight is to acquaint you with nature's purpose in giving you your teeth. Child gets his milk teeth soon fall out, no good. He gets his second teeth, they soon decay and fall out. Again no good. Nature is only trying to say to man "Go and invent for yourself some kind of genuine false teeth that will really do the work." 'They too may fall out.' But if they do, you can always stick 'em back in again. Now, the price is on.. Sufferin', jumpin' Jehoshaphat! Why, your teeth are all in slaunchwise! You ever have dizzy spells, suffer from heartburn regurgitation or liver complaint? - Huh? - Ever have glanders.. Barber's itch, or inflammation of the jaw bone? Uh, I don't know. I-I can't recollect. Exactly. Loss of memory too. 'Choose your partners for the Virginia reel!' Swing your partners. Ladies and gents.. 'Promenade!' All hands on a.. Well, Bob, I.. I'm glad to see you. Thanks. Been a long time, hasn't it? Yeah, about two years since I got run out of this town. Well, you're always welcome here, Bob. So I noticed. Well, it's just as much pleasure for me to be here as for them to have me. If you feel that way, wonder you came at all. Well, you see, the salon was closed and.. ...I gotta find me a drink. Hello, Frank. Hello, Bob. - How've you been? - Just fine. Still, uh, still working at the bank? I'm runnin' it now. I'm cashier. Well, well, well.. Must have nearly a $100 buried in it by now. Oh, we're doin' alright. Got 30,000 in deposit. You don't say. All saved up for Christmas presents, huh? I can imagine. It's that kind of a town. Yes, it is. - Married Molly yet? - No, not yet. But we're going to be soon. Well, I'm sure she'll have a very happy life with you. But kinda dull. - On the house. - Yet. Got.. I was wondering when you'd get around to seeing me. Well, Blackie.. You look like you've been peeled. Well, how do you expect me to dress for a church social? I wouldn't expect you to come at all. 'Say, how about pullin' out of here and meetin' me' down the bodega when it opens, heh? Well, I don't know. We can catch us a few drinks on this. Where'd you get that watch? Ooh, I found it in the pocket of an old coat. Oh, but it's a woman's watch. Yeah. Is, uh, is 11 o'clock alright? Yeah. Hello, Molly. Hello, Bob. How've you been? Fine. You look as if you've come a long way. Yeah. Yeah, I have. Won't you have something to eat? There's still plenty left. No, thanks, I.. Kinda surprised to see me? Yes. But I sorta felt you'd come back. Molly, I hope you baked enough pies for the sale tomorrow. I got the whole town coming over. - Over 200. - Yeah? - Seven different kinds. - Oh. Bob, this is Ed Barrow. The new owner of the bodega. Well, I'm sure glad to meet you. How do you do? You mean to say you're gonna sell pies in the saloon? Well, why not? It's for the Christmas fun. Everybody will be leaving their stores and tramping over to the bodega just to get a smack at them pies. Everybody in town will be there. Say, you, you couldn't hold that pie sale in the morning, could you? Well, yes, I think so. Any time suits me that's alright with you, Ed. Alright, I'll put up the signs tonight. You want to dance? I'd love to. You say you're leaving about noon? Yeah. Can't think of anything to keep me any longer, can ya? No. Who is that poisonous critter? Bob Sangster. He's a low-down, no account skunk. One ornery move out of him 'and I slap him right in jail.' Is he a killer? He'd kill anything from a baby to an old woman. I've always wanted to see a real western killer. Hm. Isn't it clear tonight? Yeah. The Christmas fun's gonna be bigger than ever this year. Is it? The miners have done well and the cattlemen say... Frank tells me you and him is getting married. That's what he says. Says you was engaged. That's right. - Gonna be married soon? - Yes. Well, you, you got my congratulations. Thanks. I haven't got much to give you for a weddin' present, Molly, but.. But would you take this watch? It's all I've got in the world. It was my mother's. - Oh, but, Bob... - No, no, no. Please take it. Can't you understand? Yes. Thanks, Bob. I think I know how you feel. He's a fine fellow, Frank. Yes. Honest as the day is long. - That's right. - Yes, sir. Uh, ambitious too, you know, he got a sense of responsibility. Everybody likes him. Yes. Well, of course he loves you. It's a great match, Molly. Great match. 'Cept for one thing. You don't love him. - Oh, yes, I do. - No, Molly. But I tell you I do. You can tell me from now till next Christmas. I know. You don't love him any more now than you did two years ago. You couldn't. He's the same and you're the same. - Oh, no, I'm not the same. - Oh. You mean, two years ago you loved me and tonight you don't? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Molly? Alright, I'm not asking, now I'm telling you. I'm sure you love me. You love me as much tonight as you ever did. And all these two years too. You couldn't help it sometimes, could you, wonderin' about me? Where I was, how I was. Knowin' you could no more help in lovin' me than you could help breathin'. Oh, stop it, Bob. And so you're marrying Frank to forget me, ain't that it? Ain't it? Well, I've tried everything else. Listen, Molly, I'm here tonight maybe I'll be gone tomorrow. You love me, you've waited for me, you've wanted me. Thanks, Bob. For what? For lots. I remembered somebody strong and fine. I couldn't drive his memory away. And now you've come back. Well, you're cheap and dirty and stupid. I know that now. That's why I'm thankful to you. And you might give this back to whatever mother you stole it from. Funny thing, I don't even know if she was a mother or not. Anyhow, she don't care what time it is no more. You're early. What's the matter with the social? Not a thing. Never had a better time in my life. Say, Blackie, what did you say if I was to settle down get a job, work hard and join the church? I'd say you'd gone plumb loco. Atta girl. - Hey, bartender. - 'Yeah?' How 'bout drinkin' up this watch? - Is it any good? - Any good? Eighteen carats from stem to stern. - Alright. What'll it be? - Straight rye, Ed. We got some fine, old Kentucky bourbon. Two bits a drink. Gimme some of your regular whiskey. Got more cockle berries to it. Them are good lookin' eyes you got, Blackie. - Oh! - Ha-ha-ha. Here's to you and me. To me and you. How 'bout a dance? Hey, piano player? How 'bout a little, uh.. You know, Blackie, I danced at the social but it didn't get me nowhere. Is it gonna hurt? - Sure. - Oh. 'I ran down here, see..' 'When I got to the bottom of the gulch, I.. I found my mother layin' across a heap of stones, unconscious. I picked her up, moms, and carried almost half a mile to the cabin. I laid her on a cot inside and.. ..shielded up her pretty blue eyes. Her voice was weak. Her breath come in little kinda gasps. "Sonny.." she said. She always called me sonny. "Sonny," she says, uh.. "You're the only thing I got left in the world. "Well, exceptin' that watch. "If anything should happen to me, I.. I want you to keep it with you always." She gave me that watch you got there. So, that's how it was. Do you think I could keep that watch after what you just told me? Oh, no, Ed, I.. I drank it up. It is yours. No, I wouldn't even consider it. Take it. - No. - Oh, take it, please. Well.. Thanks, Ed. Have a drink on the house. Thanks, Ed. I sure needed that. Uh, and did your mother die? No. Not from the fall. But she broke her leg and I had to shoot her. Morning, folks. Nice day, ain't it? I'm sorry, Molly, but I'll have to get back to the bank now. - I'll see ya later. - Alright. 'Come on, boys, let's go at that pie sale.' 'Yeah, I'm thirsty.' 'Oh, Frank, there's a package there for yo" 'just come in on the stage.' Good. This is one Christmas the kids in this town are gonna have a Santa Claus. - Yeah, who? You? - And why not? Now, you'll see. The whole outfit. How's that, better? Oh. - Oh, Frank. - 'Coming.' 'Just keep your hands down. Act natural.' Alright, hand it over. I'll take it right here. That's all. What's in that box? Wha.. What.. There ain't no Santa Claus. Well, I wonder who he was. Whoa! Well, ha-ha! Shook 'em off neat and pretty. Ha! That'll be half an hour finding how we slipped out of that blind gulch. Yeah, wind's in our favor too blow them hoof prints clear out of sight. Hey, you ornery fool! That stuff'll kill ya quicker than a bullet. No, not exactly, Bob. This is less merciful poison. Takes about an hour to do its work. Some more of Doc's useless education. Ah, who wants to live an hour longer? Yeah? What's it good livin' an hour less? There's a posse after us. They'll see where we go from here. There you are. "Angela Camp. 51 miles." That's right. Boy, Gus. I always thought you said you couldn't read. Gosh, almighty.. Uh, fella never knows till he tries. Pinto Flats is shortest. That's what the sheriff'll figure. That's why we're gonna make Grays Gulch. - How 'bout water? - Coachella waterhole. Forty miles off, and right on our way. Doc. Why, your arms' all blood. What's the matter? I got hit riding out of town. - Bone broken? - I don't think it's broken. But its chewed up a bit, I ought to wash it off and put on a wet bandage. No, we haven't got any time for that. Now, let's try to get to that next mesa before they spot us again. Yeah, but he's liable to get blood poison. Thank you just the same, Gus. Alright, Bob. Blow wind, come wrack, I'll die with harness on my back. Took the words right outta my mouth. I'll help you up, Doc. - What's that? - Take a look. Shot himself. 'Ain't been dead long.' Come on, Doc. You better let me fix up that wound. Name's George Marshall. From the look of his fancy clothes and this here dude's gun, he musta been a tenderfoot. Probably had some loco weed and went crazy. Easy, easy, Gus. You're not dressing a steer. Who says I ain't? Hold still now. 'I took Marshall's gun.' It's only thing he had of any value on him. - Should we bury him? - 'What's the use?' 'Nature's got the job half done' 'and the buzzards and coyotes will finish it.' Robert the perfect realist as usual. Why discriminate in favor of maggots? Now, what poetry fellow says that? Doc did. You always surprise me. Ha-ha! Well, drink hearty, boys. These horses can smell the Coachella waterhole already. Well, here's to you, Doc. Here's how, Bob. Ah! Aah! Come on. # Tula tula tula tula # # Tula tula tula tula ## What in Sam hell is that? Why, that's Doc and me's college song. Ain't it, Doc? It sure is, Gus. # Tula tula tula tula ## Look. Looks like a deserted wagon. Well, let's make sure first. Nobody's there. Maybe the owner left somethin' we can use. Nice fellow, Bob. Such a strict utilitarian. Sure, ain't he though? Woman in there. Looks dead to me. She's alive. Get your canteen. Mine's empty. Where's my baby? Why, here she is, ma'am. It's a he. 'Hey, Doc, Gus!' 'What day is this?' Me, I only know seasons, ma'am. It's-it's winter. It's Monday, ma'am. Say, Doc, some crazy tenderfoot blew up the waterhole. Yeah, but we've got to ride 88 miles to Grays Gulch without water. Shut up. Monday. We got here Friday night. The waterhole was almost dry so he tried to dynamite it to get more water. The next day our horses wandered off looking for water. George hunted all day, but couldn't find 'em so left on foot to get help. - Saturday night he... - Who left? George Marshall. My husband. 'Did any of you see him?' Sure, sure. He got to New Jerusalem alright. 'And we were sent out to find you.' That's good. I'll never see New Jerusalem. I guess I've been unconscious most of the time since George left. Except to feed my baby. Uh, we'll get you back alright, ma'am. But it's too late to even try. No. I know. You better hovel the horses. We don't want 'em runnin' off like hers did. Now, Gus, you'll find a shovel on the wagon. I can't dig with this shoulder. Better give me a hand, Bob. You know, I never did ask what your name was. No water, no grub. Just half a sack of coffee and four cans of milk. Milk? That's just what he needs. How are you doing, Mother Gus? Oh, say, you better hold him a minute. I-I gotta whittle him on a pair of pants. Little older then. I wonder if he misses his mother yet. Looks to me as if you fellows was aiming to take the kid along. If you are, you're crazy. Shucks, Bob. Babies ain't no trouble. Why, I was married to a Yaqui squaw once. She went 'hind a she burro. She used to carry two of my papooses cross my back like they was ornaments. Alright, diaper your kid. Feed him milk, feed him anything. I don't care. If it was up to me, I'd, I'd put him out of his misery. Well, it doesn't happen to be up to you. Alright, but I'm tellin' ya. Water's short. Why, that kid'll hold us up half a day gettin' into Grays Gulch. - Well, what of it? - Plenty. I'm pullin' outta here alone in the morning. 'Some of that money's just itchin' to get spent.' Well, go now if you want. Nobody's stopping you. - Shut your mouth, will you? - Now, Gus. Now, wait. Wait a minute. What's the good of all this argument? We've gotten along pretty well together so far. Ain't no argument, Doc, it's just a little difference of opinion, that's all. Gimme the little critter. I sure miss Pedro. We could have some music now if he hadn't got drilled. Yeah, but he got drilled 'cause he wouldn't throw away that dang guitar. Campin' is right. Don't catch me takin' no fool chances like that. That's why I'm the oldest desperado in the southwest. So, uh, how 'bout me, Gus? Ah, you ain't no real desperado, Doc. You don't count. Well, how about Pickles Jack? He's 45. Yeah, well, he unexpectedly got hisself hung last summer so that gives me the record. Heh, look at the little runt. What book you readin' tonight, Doc? Fellow named Schopenhauer, Gus. What's the story? Well, there isn't any story. Jokes, huh? Yes. Yes, just jokes. Man is everything. Woman, nothing. Then I'm sure gonna get me a lotta nothing soon as I hit Grays Gulch. What's the matter, Doc? Oh, I was just thinking. Funny thing. Long time ago just about Christmas time too. Three men sat around with a baby like this. That so? Anybody I know? No, nobody you knew, Gus. Oh. Friends of yours, huh? No. Not friends of mine either. Three ways. How's that, fair? Yeah, that's what I make it, three. Alright, I'll round up my horse, grab me a cup of coffee and mosey on to Grays Gulch. I'll meet you fellows in the best saloon in town.. ...if you ever get there. Hey, that coffee ain't done yet. No, but we are. You can deal them horses out. - They're dead. - Dead? Yeah, there's another poison waterhole beyond that gulch. They're lyin' there covered with buzzards. Marshall's horses, too. Then we're out of luck for water. Don't let any of that steam out. That's water. How much water have we got? Just a few drops here. We better pour it all in one canteen. You pour, Bob. Your hand's the steadiest. Mine's nearly empty, too. Nobody gets any of this, see? Till they gotta have it. Hey, where's them three cans of milk? 'Hm?' I, uh.. Here they are. That's fine. One a piece for breakfast. Here you are, Gus. Doc. Well, I'm never very hungry for breakfast. Milk always turns my stomach anyhow. Oh, I see. You're gonna give it to the kid, eh? Well, that's fine. Wait a minute, Bob. What for? We can get along alright. But babies need milk. Yeah, well, milk's what I need too. No, wait a minute. I'll buy that milk from you. For how much? That much. What's the matter with him, is he crazy? I don't know. Alright. Suits me fine. Thanks for the trade, kid. 'Five thousand dollars for one mangy little can of milk. Hm!' 'You'll be drinkin' pure gold.' Well, the horses have settled one thing. It's too far to Grays Gulch. We've got to go back to New Jerusalem. Yeah. Where we'll get a warm welcome and a cold rope. Nobody can walk 88 miles to Grays Gulch with less than half a pint of water let alone taking a kid. You fellows still mean to say you're gonna carry that brat? If you think you can make Grays Gulch alone, Bob try it. We'll give you your fourth of water. Ah, nobody can walk 88 miles in a mouth full of water. I gotta go back to New Jerusalem with you. Alright, but I'll have nothin' to do with that kid, see? Nursin', carryin' or feedin'. Nobody asked you to. No, I'll.. I'll carry him first. But you got that poison in your shoulder. That's why. It beats me how Doc has got so much interest in a woman he ain't never seen before. Yeah? Well, maybe he's gettin' closer to her than you think. And a whole lot closer than I wanna think. Look at that. Men'll be comin' here just like us lookin' for water. Say, Gus. I'll bet there'll be a dozen skeletons around that hole in a couple of years. Come on, let's get going. Oh, dang these rocks. Say, Doc, who's that friend you said could swat a stone and make water came out? Then Moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice the water came forth abundantly. Moses. That's him. I wish he'd show up here for just once swat. I knew a fella named Moses once. He run a tailor shop over in Las Vegas. - Did he have a beard, Gus? - No, he was clean shaved. Wasn't the same fellow. Bob. Water, Bob. This has the coffee in it. May give your heart a kick. Just a little more. Bob. 'Better rest a while.' - What's that? - Gila monster. Hm, just like alligators, aren't they? I wonder if they're amphibious. Sure they're furious. They'll bite clean through your leg. Say, Doc. Why don't you get rid of them books? They're nothin' but dead weight. - "Dead weight?" - Sure. Dead weight. I guess you're right, Bob. The only complaint I ever heard about your poetry, John Milton.. ...always a little...too heavy. Well, let's get goin', boys. Gimme a hand up, Gus. - You better let me take him. - No. Not yet, Gus. I'll tell you when. This is the last of the coffee water. One swallow a piece. About the baby, Gus. You think he'll make it? I don't know. Bob has my share of the money. I'm sorry I haven't got anything to give you. Shucks, I don't want nothin', Doc. Yes, I do though. I wish you'd give me one of your books so that I have somethin' to remember you by in case we got split up somehow. But you look fine. Take your pick. How 'bout the joke book? Schopenhauer? That's the brown one. It must be great to... have education and.. Well... someday I'm gonna catch me some and.. ...then I'll be able to read me these jokes and.. '...think of you.' You know, Gus, you ought to make a will. - What for? - Oh, everyone has one. You ought to anyhow. A fellow over Santa Fe was going to make me one one time, but.. ...I never had no money and he ...never got around to it. I'll write one for you, Gus. Would ya? Say, that'd be great. My real name is Sam Barton, if it makes any difference. Mm-hmm. Who do you want to leave your things to, Gus? Why, to you. No. No, you better leave 'em to Bob. He's younger and he'll last longest. W-whatever you think. Hmm, "I, Samuel Barton "being of sound mind "do give and bequeath "all my property, real and personal "to Robert Sangster. "Witness.. ...James Underwood." That's my real name. Gus, make a cross right there. Yeah. Can't you shut that brat up? It's worse than a pack of howlin' coyotes. Why, he's teething, Bob. His gums hurt. Yeah? Gus. Yeah? Oh, how do you feel, Doc? I'm alright. There's a packet of letters in that saddlebag. Yeah, I remember. Give 'em to me. Mighty pretty writin'. Yes. Mm, you was gonna tell me about them letters some time. Was I, Gus? Anything else I can do, Doc? No. Oh, yes. Yes. There's a book in there. Oh, sure. Which one? It's called "Macbeth" by Shakespeare. What kind of books did Shakespeare write? Red books or green books? He wrote green ones, Gus. Thanks. Water, Doc? No, no more for me. It'll only be wasted. Give some to him. Well.. ...you fellas better get started. I'll cash in here. Oh, I-I-I know what I'm saying. I'd only hold you up. 'You know I'm right, Bob.' I guess so, Doc. I guess you're right. I ain't goin'. Yes, you are. It's best that way. Not for me it ain't. Leavin' you. Now, Gus.. ...suppose it was you instead of me you'd want me to go, wouldn't ya? Would I? Why? Because.. Because this kid has a better right to live than any of us.. ...or all us. Anything I can do, Doc? No. - Don't you have fire? - No, no. No, thanks. Well, so long. So long, Bob. Funny. Where you start has nothing to do with where you finish.. ...or how. Here, Gus. "Tomorrow... and tomorrow.. "...and tomorrow.. "...creeps in petty pace "day after day "to the last syllable of recorded time. '"And all our yesterdays' '"lighted fools the way to dusty death.' '"Out, out, brief candle.' '"Life is but a walking shadow.' '"A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage' '"never to be heard again.' '"A tale told by an idiot.' '"Full of sound and fury' 'signifying nothing."' No sleepin' this time. Just ten minutes' rest and two miles more. Doc said that.. ...there's only 5000 feet in a mile. Yeah? Two-thousand steps. That's what Doc says. - Bob? - Yeah? If I give out.. ...what'll you do? I won't hold him up. If he can crawl to New Jerusalem it's alright with me. Come on! Come on! Wait a minute, Bob. Can't you shut off that squallin'? Milk's all gone, he's got a tooth comin' through. He.. If he had somethin' to bite on, why.. Here. Let him bite on this. Gentle, Jesus.. ...meek and mild.. ...look upon this little child. Pity my simplicity.. ...suffer me.. ...to come...to Thee. What're you mumblin' about? I.. Just somethin' I remembered when I was a kid. Hey, Gus. Gus? "Bob... if you get this will, it means that Gus is dead, too. "If you never did anything human before "give the kid an even break. "James Underwood. Doc." 'Say, you would crawl to New Jerusalem, huh?' Just like I said. Well, I say you got nerve, anyway. ' "Even break" he says, huh?' I'll give ya an even break. They ya are. Now, go to sleep. If you got any sense, you'll never wake up. Shut up! Now, look what you done. Made me kill that poor little rattlesnake. You got me so flustered with your bawlin' I couldn't aim straight. Can't leave you alone a minute without you gettin' into some kind of devilment, can I? That little snake just wanted to get warm and you got pesterin' it and blow it out. Hm. Nice fellow, ain't you? You know you gotta be a good sport about these things. Maybe you think I ain't thirsty. You got it easy. Ya.. You've been carried all the way. Here. If ya spill any of this, I'll punch you right in the nose. Yeah. Well, there's only one swallow left, see? No more. Well, maybe I'll match you for it later on. Desert must be gettin' to me. I'm... I'm actin' crazy. There are the buzzards already, kid. Waitin' for us. Why don't they come closer? What are they afraid of? Or do they have to smell carrion before they light. Wait a minute. I know. It's him. 'Your father.' And he had a canteen. It's no use, kid. We can't make it. We're licked. Your daddy got this far. Only about nine miles from New Jerusalem. But.. But it's five hours at the rate we're goin'. Well, I tried kid. I want you to believe that. I tried. But I'm only human. Nothin' human can help us now. Nothin' human. Listen. It ain't for me I'm askin'. I don't read nothin'. But I always heard you was.. ...you was good to babies. Our Father.. I can't pray. I don't know how to pray. Water. Water. Water. Doc says that poison don't hit you for an hour. One hour.. ...five and a half miles. Maybe.. Maybe.. Fill up good and plenty. Get my belly full of the water and then go fast. That's it. That's it. Here's to you, kid. He's dead. A woman's watch. I wonder where he stole it. He didn't steal that watch. It belonged to his mother.
