[eerie vocalizing] [soft foreboding music] [thunder crackling] [dark foreboding music] - [Warren] Hollywood: deep, dark. That source of infinite entertainment, wonder and mystery. Home for the beautiful, the ugly, the rich, the poor and the weird. In the following film, you will experience individuals whose lives dwell beyond the boundaries of understanding and may appear unusual, freaky and bizarre. Man is an animal of compassion and evolution. What we don't understand we can learn from. What you're about to see is an eye-opening journey into the underbelly of Hollywood. Porn stars, freakshows, transvestites and fire eaters exist among the rich and famous as an integral part of the entertainment industry. These are the underdogs, the unsung heroes of the business. Join our host Dark Infinity as we begin our journey at the California Institute for Abnormal Arts where Carl Crew gives a tour of many of the freaks and oddities that await you behind their alluring doors. Welcome to "Hollyweird." - My name's Carl Crew and I am a writer, an actor, producer and do a mean soft shoe and many, many things. I was a mortician. I had an antique store in Haight-Ashbury. Basically I grew up in a repertory theater group from a kid 'til I was like 20 for like 17 years. And I studied film and I decided to move to Hollywood. And I got down here. Six months later, I got my firstlead role in "Blood Diner." And I actually met one of the producers, Bill Osco who was famous for such wonderful hits as "Alice in Wonderland: X," which was really R back then. And "Flesh Gordon". He was like 23 and he made like 23 million dollars like 50 years ago. I mean you know what kinda money that is? He moved into the Bee Gees mansion. You know, like wow. Anyway, so we started makin' movies together. I did one more movie with Jackie Kong and Bill Osco. They were married. It was called "The Under Achievers." Originally "Night School," but they had to change the name. But my costar Rick Burkes, brilliant actor. Fantastic. He was "Blood Diner." We got two little roles in "Under Achievers." And then I started writing, producing and making my own films with Bill Osco. "Gross Out," "Urban Legends," "Lunch with Larry." And we were talking on the phone one night and he's going, "You know what? "You look exactly like Jeffrey Dahmer." I'm like, "I'm gonna punch you." And then I go, "Huh." And then I literally got on the computer and I found the police interviews with Jeffrey and I wrote the script for "Jeffrey Dahmer: The Secret Life." And we immediately got funding for that and we did it. We did it in secret. That's what I told the trades, you know. I said, "We're shooting this in secret." And my fax machine explodedwith 20,000 faxes in one month. Literally, there was a puff of smoke coming from it. If you ever wanna do something and get it out there, you tell people you're doing this part in secret for whatever reason andeveryone go out and talk to you. But that got a lotta press. It never was released in the theaters though. It just went straight to video, but we had just a lotta, lotta, lotta pressure. We did "Maury Povich" and we did "Milwaukee's Talking." I literally got interviewed at Jeffrey Dahmer's apartment door and I reached out and touched the door. Next day the papers, "Oh yeah, that Carl Crew. "He made love to Jeffrey Dahmer's door." I'm like, "Wow, this is hilarious publicity." The director was pissed. He was like, "No, that's terrible." I go, "Relax. "Publicity's publicity." Then when we did "Milwaukee's Talking," the family would kind of, you know. Of course a movie's gonna be made about one of the most heinous serial killers. So like we settle them down. By the time we got to "Maury Povich," they had whipped 'em into a frenzy. So it was the "Barbecue Carl Crew Show." [chuckles] Which I'm a debater and I loved it. But I got called Jeffrey Dahmer number two you know, and all this stuff. Actually I have a Facebook page Facebook. It's called "Jeffrey Dahmer: The Secret Life" and it's about the film and the archived "Maury Povich" is on there. If you want a cheap thrill. [chuckles] But then I got involved with making. Well I got involved with Chris Miller. We did a bunch of films together, not lead roles. I've always had lead roles. But for a while I was so busy with this club we've had for 25 years, California Institute of Abnormal Arts. We're still here after 25 years. Freakshows, magic shows, puppet shows. We have a museum. We're in the Ripley's hardback book last year because I have three dead bodies from 100 years ago. I used to be a mortician. I lived in a mortuary for five years and I know the rules. Pre-1925, I don't need a permit. So I have a dead clown and two dead Chinese magicians. Yup. [Dark Infinity speaking faintly] I'm sorry? - Freakshow in St. Louis? - Say again? - [Dark Infinity] "Freakshow: Los Angeles" the book. - Oh, that was a book that got ruined. This is the original book, okay? And it's 500 pages. It's full color and this guy did a deal with me. He's like, "Yeah, we're gonna publish this book." And he put it down to 200 pages and he screwed it all up and made blank pages so you could write notes like what are you doing? And finally his company went bankrupt and I got my rights back. It was ridiculous. I was furious when I saw it. But yeah, this is literally about 18 years of all the press, all the publicity, the whole story. Every freakshow picture, every flyer ever designed from 25 years. Hold on. I'll wait for this to go by. Oh, it's good. Anyway, yeah. So I did it on CreateSpace and we got like 300 copies and it cost me $39 a book to print. And we had to sell it for like $45, you know? It's like a textbook. But I got the deal with Amazon. They go, "Oh yeah, we'll give you some money "for every book." I go, "Really, how much?" Goes, "A penny." I'm like, "No." The club started here and we got some really amazing people attracted to their club. A friend of mine was a producer and he goes, "Dude, I have to show you something." And I said, "What?" He showed me this DVD of a thing called "Happy Turkey Day" with Shaye Saint John and it literally blew my mind. I didn't know what I was lookin' at and I said, "I have to meet this person. "Whoever these people are, I have to meet them." So he gave me Eric's number and I called him up. And we struck it off and he came over here and he introduced me to Shaye Saint John who was [exhales] an enigma. They were two separate people, Eric and Shaye. I worked with them both for 10 years. Shaye was a handicapped. Well she was in a train wreck. She was put into a military hospital. And they have been doing all this MKUltra stuff there and they thought they killed her. They did the most implantation they've ever done on anybody. There were cool people in the hospital that snuck her out and hid her in an art colony and that's where my friend Eric met her. And so he would bring her over here and we would give her some props and wigs and whatever and set her up with some. Very hard to talk to her. She talked like this, [imitates Shaye]. I mean it was like [sighs] and she wore a wig mask over her face. When go into a wig store, the same face that's on all the wigs, that was her face. In other words, she bought 100 of those 'cause she was disfigured. I've never seen her face and I worked with her for 10 years. No one has ever saw her face. She was in a wheelchair. She had to have her arms and legs amputated because of the lack of flow of blood or whatever. And she didn't want prosthetics, so she used mannequin arms and legs. She was just a movie star. She thought she was a movie star. It was like so bizarre. I was in horror and roaring with laughter for 10 years. Eventually my friend Eric drank himself to death. He just died. Yeah. And then everyone said, "Oh, RIP Eric. "RIP Shaye," 'cause everyone thought he played Shaye. Well I waited three years and then I made a little tiny movie with Larry Wessel and it's called "Shaye Saint John: Trigger Happy" and it tells the real story. Shaye is still alive. She's in a witness protection program. The people that snuck her out of the hospital, they knew that Eric was dying and they made a deal with him to help him. If he could do one Shaye Saint John video making it look like he played Shaye, so she could escape into a witness protection program. I mean this is 10 years. It's the weirdest stuff I've ever. You could get it or you could order "Triggers" compilation on the Internet. And these are the early Shayes, we used to do 'em here and then Eric would render his stuff. It would take weeks to do 'cause it'd be back in the day, you know? Like before 2000 or right around 2000, very primitive. Like you'd do like 10 minutes and render it for two weeks. You know, it's crazy. But he would come here and drop them off and we would screen them here. We were the first people to show Shaye Saint John. And people would just walk out goin', "What did I just see?" So great. It added to the whole mystery of the institute. Before she left, I talked to her. I said, "You know, if you ever just call me sometime "and make sure you know, you're okay, "I wanna know you're okay." I said, "But when you do, say this word." I said the word and she said, "Look, man." That wasn't the word, that's how she was. And 3 1/2 years later, I got a call from a restricted number and I heard, "Hello again." There's been other people that have tried to call and say, "Yeah, it's Shaye." "Okay, what's the word?" No one could say it. I heard it three o'clock in the morning. I said, "You're okay," and she goes, "I'm okay." And that was it, click and that was it. So I know she made it. I know she's out there somewhere, but I just hope she comes back. I don't know how weird it's gonna be without Eric to do his brilliant editing on. But yeah, that was really an amazing part of my life. They wrote an article. They just came out with a huge article. She got pressed all over the world: "Bizarre" magazine. "Girls and Corpses" interviewed her here in person and that was weird. She made a couple appearances here and sign stuff with her rubber hands. It was so bizarre. Well "Vice" magazine just came out with a huge article on Shaye Saint John and they interviewed people. There was this woman named Leonora Claire. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous chanteuse and an art critic. She's actually in the news right now. She got stalkers and she got legislation passed for stalking. It was really good. It's just that she's on the news. But she used to come and do these shows at Apocalipstick with Kitten Natividad and they had Shaye show up. She signed stuff. She was chosen by the people that wanted to help Shaye escape as the person that would see a fake costume draped over her chair. So she'd say, "Eric is Shaye." So it was orchestrated that and I just recently told her that. I never even told her that. So she was the one. So in the article from "Vice" magazine, "Oh yeah, that's right." Then they interviewed me and I was like, "No, that's not it." [chuckles] Anyway it was just wonderful. It was wonderful to be involved with such electric burst of creative energy and he was a maximalist artist. That's what I am. I'm a maximum. Why bother with being anything else, you know? My great uncle was Jerry Crew. Jerry Crew was a logger. Along with my father and my other uncle, Jerry Crew took the first plaster cast of Bigfoot in 1958 on Mount Shasta and literally changed the name from Sasquatch to Bigfoot with his discovery. He took it to the Humboldt Times and they took a picture of him holding the cast. It went worldwide. This is 1958. Yeah. So in the crypto-zoological world, all the people that do all this stuff, they all know who Jerry Crew is. He's like the grandfather, even though Bigfoot went back hundreds of years with sightings of wild men. But I've been doing research and writing a script about the life of Jerry Crew, interviewing everyone who's left alive. Like I interviewed Peter Byrne. He's like 90 years old. He hunted the Yeti in the Himalayas and he was hired by an amazing guy named Tom Slick from Texas who was a millionaire. These people, I mean like they described Peter Byrne as the Don Quixote, Indiana Jones. I mean this guy went out. I mean amazing books by this guy and I interviewed him few times. Amazing stuff I got outta him. So my other uncle who wasthere, my father was also there. He gave me 50 years of yellowed articles and cutouts of Bigfoot articles that I've been pourin' through and going through the scripts. It's like family history. It was amazing. It was amazing, I'm almost finished with it too. So yeah, that's what I've been working on lately. I did write the sequel to "Blood Diner" called "Blood Dinner." I have about 10 scripts I finished. I'm really tryin' to balance my time between the club which takes up all my time and get back heavy into more filmmaking. That's what I love to do. I just love to create stuff, you know? So this club has always been just constant creating stuff and doing new stuff and trying out stuff. And yeah, it's been a very interesting road. Yeah. - [Dark Infinity] Where do you see the future of your club? - [laughs] I wanna go full-heavy. I mean I'm an artist. You know, it's like this is 25 years. I think that's enough, hey. I have no idea, I have no idea. You know, I know very specifically I wanna start getting back into heavy filmmaking again and just whatever or wherever my muse takes me. [soft mystical music] [singer vocalizing] - [Dark Infinity] My next stop was a visit to a classroom. But this isn't your typical kind of class, it was an outdoor one at night. And they weren't teaching math or physics but rather fire eating. Professional fire eater Derrick Vermin teaches classes on a weekly basis to those interested in learning the craft. He's performed at Knotfest and Lost Lands and worked alongside at Dr. Phil's son. He had a few moments betweenlessons to sit down and tell us about what makes this a unique, magical and one-of-a-kind skill. - I've been a fire performer since 2007 performing with like poets, staff, fans, things like that. And I guess later on, it started getting into more of like fire at circus performances, then fire eating was kinda introduced to things. It was introduced to my world. I just kinda like jumped in there, got into it, tried to figure out what it was. I knew some people in the circus world who were into it and they introduced me to it. I fell in love with the fire just doin' fire performance, but I fell in love with fire again. Like over again even deeper once I got into fire eating. It's just a different way of handling the fire. It's what more people would call fire manipulation and it's just really controlling it just with your mouth and with the torches, getting really just up-close with the fire. There's a breaking down of certain fear barriers that you go through when you're learning to eat fire or breathe fire. And getting past those, just makes you feel so different about it all. Yeah, so it becomes a passion, really like gets into a passion right away. Well the classes I'm teaching. Well I know that fire eating has become a lot more popular in the past five years. Like me and a lot of other people have been kind of developing it more in the past five to 10 years than it has in its whole lifetime of it being done. Even hundreds of years ago, people were doin' fire eating. But the kinda stuff we're doin' now, we started to like raise the bar up. And now because of that, it's been being seen everywhere. A lotta people are tryin' to get into it, but not everybody's learning the correct way. There's like a proper way to go through it that makes it fun, makes it safe, makes it healthy to where you're not gonna... There's lot less chance of you burning yourself. And at the same time, it allows you to really expand on all the tricks that there are. So I really wanna make it accessible. Some people are still gonna go try it in their backyard and I don't want 'em to that. I wanna be at least out there so I could teach 'em the right way. They can expand on it from there with the other people they know that are fire eaters. But as long as they learn the proper techniques of it and safety, learn about thekinda fuels and stuff like that, then hopefully they're gonna grow in a good environment. In my hometown, I started my own kinda troupe there. We started doin' shows, birthday parties, events, fundraisers, then music festivals and things like that that were goin' on around in my town. But then I started getting these bookings for outside of it too and that really started around the time where I teamed up with "Dangerous D Shock Show" to go to Knotfest. And I ended up doin' that two years. I've done some other shows like that too like Blackest of the Black and also Lost Lands which was out there in Ohio. And then even got booked for a show doing Dr. Phil's son Jordan, his dirty-30 birthday party. I went and performed for that. And so like I've taken the whole fire eating and breathing thing to lotta different big music festivals and private parties. And so that's what I've been doing with it, yeah. - [Dark Infinity] So what does the future hold for you then? - Oh, the future? You know, I would love to be able to either be part of or to start my own kinda performance troupe where we really push the boundaries of the artistic side of it all. I think that's my goal. I mean like goin' to these festivals and doin' these things, it feels more like I'm out there. It like an ambiance, like just in the background kinda doin' these things. But like I really wanna create like a showcase for displaying the real art behind it. Like fire eating and these things are kind of like half magic,half flow and half performance. It's already known that people can do fire eating, but I wanna show what kind of magical performance you can do with it. And I wanna be able to create a venue for that or to be part of that. And then to see more people involved in that and try to get more people to connect to it, getting real just like deep in the musicality of the fire art itself and the performance. You know, it's just a crazy thing to see that you're takin' this element of fire. And it's already within us to draw away from it and to not have it anywhere near us and for it to just exist how it is and for it to be something that we almost see as kind of uncontrollable. But through fire eating and other fire manipulation arts, we're learning the science of it, the nature on how it works and being able to manipulate that. So some of the things that we're doing where we're not just eating the fire, not just putting it in our mouth. But we're taking it and now it's burning the vapor and we're able to just let fire come out of our mouth. It's something that when anybody sees that that hasn't seen it before. They're just like, "Wait, how is that happening? "How is that possible?" It's really just the science of it and there's no real magic trick to it. Lotta people talk about magic as there being a trick, some sorta deception behind it. But with fire eating, there are no tricks. It just is literally what we're doin'. You're seeing fire come outta your mouth and it's not supposed to be something that's supposed to be there. But we're able to just control it and that becomes the magic behind it. [rhythmic electro music] ♪ Ready - I'm Derrick Vermin and I eat fire. [eerie laughing] - [Dark Infinity] In Hollywood, horror is hot. So we couldn't pass up an opportunity to catch up with horror hostess Malvolia: the Queen of Screams. - Good evening, my victims. For those of you who do not know me, I'm Malvolia: the Queen of Screams. [thunder crackling] Hi everyone, my name is Jennifer Nangle and I am the creator and actress of "Malvolia: Queen of Screams." To be honest with you, I never wanted to be a horror hostess. This was never in the plans. Filmmaking was never in the plans. Basically what happened was about almost four years ago, there was a film franchise that was released with a woman's name in the title and I had noticed that it had always had male directors. Then usually the female lead was always like a victim of some sort, so I wanted to be a part of this franchise and be a female director. Also have a female voice and maybe have a lead female badass you know, fight back. So I wrote "The Treatment" and I sent it off to the creator and he politely declined it. But one of the producers who had read it really encouraged me to pursue my idea 'cause he thought that it was really interesting. So not being under the film franchise and the restrictions of it, I knew I still wanted to keep that badass female lead character. But I wanted to go in a direction where I could talk about a horror genre that wasn't being talked about very much. So a couple months later, I went to Son of Monsterpalooza and that was the year that they were celebrating Elvira. And I was so amazed at her current popularity. I mean she was famous back in the 80s. I mean it's been several decades and yet there were crazy amounts of people waiting in line for her, just to only have two minutes with her. Just to say, "Hi, how are you?" Take a quick picture, get a signature and that was it. My mind was blown over that situation. So I thought okay, horror hosting. You know, nobody's talking about it. That could definitely have obviously a strong female character, so that's what I wanted to have my feature film be about. I stand corrected now. I understand that there are still many, many horror hosts and hostesses across the nation, if not worldwide, still on public access, still hosting you know, films and stuff like that. But at the time, I had no idea. So I got to researching. I went down the route of the original who I think is one of the original horror hostesses. I started researching Vampira. And I know that one of her icons or who she was referencing off of was Morticia Addams and the Addams Family. So I took a little bit ofVampira, little bit of Morticia, luckily found this dress on Amazon Prime and got to tryin' to figure out what I wanted to do with the character. So while I was writing the feature film, I was super huge and a fan of "Blair Witch Project" and how they you know, put their film out. They made it that it was real. And so I kinda wanted to go that route and make this character real. I also thought that if I had a stable fan base when I was done with the feature film, I would already have that fan base. I would already have that numbers and it would be easier for distribution. So my boyfriend and I, we came up with some press pictures. I reached out to some horror bloggers. And on January 1st of 2017, I released the iconic picture where my hands are up and we have the teal-green background with the curtains. People went crazy. [chuckles] They went crazy for her. They didn't know anything about her. I just denounced her name and the Queen of Screams which is a play on of "Scream Queen." People were like, "Wow, she's solid. "She's strong." And so then I realized I really had to get cracking on this web series to make her real, so we could do the feature film. But what happened was the more episodes I was putting out as the web series on you know, the easiest platform you can on YouTube 'cause you already have an audience built right there, people just couldn't get enough. They just wanted more and more and more. And so I realized you know, I couldn't kill her off in a feature film. I had to keep going with this. So here I am [chuckles] on the verge of possibly moving into season four and I'm currently writing an "Origins" feature film script. Basically when we were doing the web series which was the first time that I was doing the hosting, we film in my living room. So here I was at home, we put up a set. We used the curtains. A friend of mine, he donated his short film that I could host. And one of the producers at the time, he wrote the script for the first episode. And I was not necessarily nervous because I was working with friends. But the dialog that we first started out with was very intimidating and it was really difficult for me to memorize. So I just wanted to make sure that I got all the words out properly and easily, just flowing off the tongue. And so I believe we shot two or three episodes at one time. So yeah and it's on YouTube. First episode of season one, so that was my first hosting experience. So some of the projects that I have been involved in as Malvolia: the Queen ofScreams is 1031 and 1031 part 2. Both of those are available through Scream Team Releasing. Basically I just host in the beginning and at the end. I also did host "Theater of the Deranged Part 3" which is available on Troma Now. I obviously have my own YouTube channel. I have three seasons on there. There's a mixture of hosting independent horror short films and there's also skits that we do of the character. Because again, acting is my base and my love. And also other projects that I have out right now is Dustin Ferguson's "The Last Roommate." It's kind of like "Single White Female" meets really creepy [chuckles] characters. And so that was a huge experience. I know starting out 2020, I wanted to have a challenging role that would take me outta my comfort zone and maybe people might've not seen me in that light. And let me tell you, "The Last Roommate" hit every single one of those requests that I had, so I'm done with 2020 with all the challenges. [chuckles] So any advice that I can give anybody that wants to either horror host or get into filmmaking is just do it. You know, be creative, think outside the box, pick up that camera and just do it. A lotta people never get started and that's because of a lotta fear, fear of failure or fear of success, whatever it is. That's what always holds a lotta people back. There really is no excuse not to do what you wanna do nowadays. I mean we all have you know, cameras on our phones. We all have DSLRs. I mean you know, anything that seems to be a device has a camera on it. So there's no reason not to pick it up and you know, just be creative and experiment. Not everything's gonna be perfect. Not everything is gonna go the way that you want it to go and sometimes those are blessing in disguises. You know, you can do so much pre-production and hope that everything is gonna fit the way that it needs to fit. But when you get on set youknow, you might run out of time. You know, this one setup might've not worked at this one location that you had. So you gotta think outside the box and just go with what you have and what you know. And then usually everything always works out for the best. So stay positive, stay hopeful and then just do it. - [Dark Infinity] In the 1980s, breakdancing was all the rage in Florida and Southern California. It was a popular style that would soon spread across the country thanks to the nationwide successof movies like "Breakin'." One of the original pioneers of the genre is a man who goes by the name The Egyptian Lover. He's released breakdance and electro music consistently since he took the scene by storm back in 1982 in Uncle Jamm's Army. I've had the pleasure of working with him in the past on a music video I directed for his 2014 single "Freaky Deaky Machine." Today, he's pairing his new album 1986 and we were able to catch up with him outside the studio for an intimate discussionabout his very prolific career. - Think my older brother and my older sister inspired me to make music 'cause they were always listenin' to music. They loved music. I remember my sister goin' to a club one time comin' home sayin', "We heard this record, "but it was a long version "of a sheet song called "Dance Dance Dance." She went out and bought it the next day and played it. I'm like, "Wow, I wanna be in that club life." Then I saw a movie called "Thank God It's Friday." The deejay was in the movie was just so cool. It was like the prettiest girl that came in the club. It was like the other guy was bettin' him. "Betcha can't get her." Blah, blah blah and he was the deejay. Of course the deejay get all the girls. I'm like, "I'm gonna be a deejay." [chuckles] So I wanted to be a deejay, but I didn't know how to make music. But I knew what records to play at the party. So by being a deejay, I knew what records to play, what breakdowns to play and what got the party hot. But my younger brother X-fion played music and wrote music. He was a saxophone player and he used to write music. I was really impressed. And he saw me listen' to "Mary Jane" by Rick James one day. He said, "That's a nice bass line." And I'm like, "What are you talkin' about?" He said, "You hear the bass line?" I'm like, "Listen to the words, Mary Jane." He said, "Start it over and only listen to the bass line." So I started it over, only listened to the bass line and I was like, "Wow, that's a nice bass line." He said, "Start it over again, only listen to the strings." So I started it over again and only listened to the strings and the song just came alive to me. He said, "Keep startin' it over "and every time you start over, "listen to somethin' different." So the next time I start it over, I went and listened to the drums and I heard different things with the drums and the feels. And I'm like. So I broke the whole song apart piece-by-piece by listenin' to it over and over again, every part. And that when I went to the studio, it taught me how to put together a song part-by-part by my younger brother teaching me how to listen to a song. So actually I owe my whole career to my younger brother. Thanks, little brother. The name Egyptian Lover, the Egyptian part came from King Tut who was a young king who ran his own empire. I wanna be like a young man who had his own business and run my own empire. And the lover came from a 20. Let's see, silent filmmaker. Think it was from the 1920s, I'm not sure. His name was Rudolf Valentino and I saw one of his movies called "The Sheik." When they put the lights on his eyes and he looked at the women, he was just like the lover. I was like, "Wow, I would love to be somethin' like that." So I got King Tut and Rudolf Valentino together. Egyptian Lover, that this is a man who's also a lover and that's where the name came from. I think the best memories are the very beginning when I was with Uncle Jamm's Army back in '83. We used to get parties just deejays givin' parties at the LA Sports Arena with 10,000 party people. And it was just unbelievable, all the speakers. We had a couple hundred survey speakers just bumpin'. And the biggest highlight is when I brought my 808 to the first. Actually to the last Uncle Jamm's Army party we gave, I brought the 808 drum machine and nobody knew what a drum machine was back in '83. So I was playin' "Planet Rock" with my own breakdown. I turned the volume down on "Planet Rock" and played the 808 drum machineand everybody kept dancin'. So I was like I got 'em. They're dancin' to a drum machine. Then I turned the hi-hats up, then I turned the cowbell up. Then the room shot up. Now they're just dancin' to nothin' but a drum machine. They didn't stop dancin', just kept dancin'. So then I was kinda nervous. Okay, I'm gonna change the beat. Then I changed the beat, so they want boom, boom, boom, boom. Just want [imitates rhythmic drums], so it was a little different beat. I changed the beat and they kept dancin'. I was nervous as hell, like I hope they dance to this drum machine and they kept dancin'. And I heard one slut scream up, "What song is that?" As soon as he said it back, I said, "I got 'em "if he's not playin' records." So then I started breakin' the beat down 808, turnin' the toms up [imitates rhythmic drums]. Turnin' to the cowbell. Doin' different cowbell rhythms[imitates rhythmic cowbell]. You know, just goin' crazy with 808. Turnin' the bass up a little bit from boom, boom to the [imitates rhythmic booming]. And the crowd's just goin' crazy. They kept sayin', it's hard to change the beat. "Man, what songs are you playin'? "What songs are you playin'? "C'mon, man. "Tell us, tell us." So then the owner of Uncle Jamm's Army ran up on stage said, "Man, what songs are those? "Those are hot." I said, "It's the drum machine." He said, "What?" I said, "It's this drum machine." He looked at it and he's like, "You tellin' me you brought a drum machine?" I'm like, "What? "It sounds just like a record." He said, "We need to make a record." So we went to the studio and we met the big star playin'at the club, at the party. "Yes, Yes, Yes" when we made a new song called [indistinct], put that out and that was, man. That's fortunately in a show when the drum machine personified the hybrid model. The next project I'm workin' on. Workin' on two projects right now. Pyramix Volume 2, which I'm doin' a lotta remixes from old songs like "Girls" and "You're So Fine" and "Egypt Egypt." Doin' new mixes of the old songs and also adding some new songs that didn't make 1986. I mean this song that made 1986 which is another project I'm workin' on. I did 1984, I did 1985 and now I'm workin' on 1986 which'll probably be out at the end of 2020 or by Valentine Day 2021. Pyramix will probably come out early 2020. Man, if you haven't heard Pyramix #1, make sure you listen to that. Then Pyramix 2 will be just like that, but probably two hours of music nonstop. So I don't know if I'm gonna do a vinyl on that, but we're thinkin' about it. Maybe some 12 inches from that. But you'll definitely see a two hour nonstop mixtape from the Egyptian Lover called Pyramix 2, so make sure you check that out. And to my fans: Man, thank you for all around the world just comin' to the parties, the festivals and just showin' your support. 'Cause all the energy you give me, I give it right back. Soon as I go back to the hotel, I'm inspired to write more music. It's just a vicious circle, just me gettin' the energy from you, you givin' it back to me and me givin' it back to you and you givin' it back to me and I love it. Thank you. - This shit ain't over. This shit ain't over, y'all. Put your motherfuckin' hands up one time. Yeah. [rhythmic hip-hop music] Please start it like you do in the early stages, 1983. We make music that is satisfying to the soul. That shit got right here. Listen to this shit. Listen, listen. Here we go. [mystical hip-hop music] ♪ You're so fine - Then again. - We love you. - Thank y'all. - Goodnight. - [Dark Infinity] Our next stop on this journey through Hollyweird takes us to the home of famed adult actress and webcam model Alana Evans. Known for her work in the adult field most of her life, she's additionally sang for the Lords of Acid and recently began acting in mainstream horror films. Tonight, she discusses her role as an advocate and the positive change shehopes to bring to the industry. - Hi, I'm Alana Evans. I am a porn star turned webcammer. [chuckles] I've been in the adult industry since 1998, always did films. I've been a big gamer. So I found ways to incorporate different aspects of my real life into my career. You know, have fun while you'remaking your money, right? But as technology changes, porn has changed so, so much. The people are different, the sets are different. The type of content that they're filming is different. It's a little bit more violent. It's more aggressive. That's not my bag, it never really has been. And so as the industry changed you know, I moved into more of an advocacy role. But with that, who's going to hire you when you're the one telling everybody how to do things safely? You're a risk. So I found my way into webcamming because I could completely set my own rules, control what I do, what kinda content, what kinda shows I'm doing and I control my room. And man, once you get that sensation of being completely in charge, there's kind of no going back. I am very lucky because I have the fanbase that automatically brings people into my room. You know, people come in. They can't believe they're talking to me. It's the cutest thing. It's great for my ego. Let's be real, this is one-on-one, instant reaction. Whereas a porn star when I started in the 90s, the Internet didn't exist like that at all. Nobody trusted it. Porn sites didn't exist. And so there wasn't any instant gratification like there is now meaning I film a movie, I'm gonna wait six months beforemaybe it hits the shelves. And then you'll go to a trade show six months later. Maybe a few people know who you are. And then maybe the next year, you got a line around the cornerand you've got legit fans. But it took work, it took fan clubs. Now social media, webcamming. The Internet changed, everything. You can take pictures up of yourself, build your own little fan page and you're a superstar and in the matter of minutes without filming one actual movie. And webcamming is no different. I can be one-on-one with that fan who's having their own carved intimate experience with me. At that point, I'll give them control because I'm still the only one touching me. I'm the only one interacting with myself and my physical being, you know? I'm safe. I'm not gonna get sick. I'm gonna have fun [chuckles] on my terms. And you know, in that moment when the show's over and they're throwing money at you or they're leaving these amazing reviews, you know right then and there how happy you just made that fan. And now they're gonna be a fan for life. They're gonna buy all your content. They're gonna go to all your social media. They're gonna come to your cam room again and again and again and that totally beats that waiting period, you know? Even now though, it's still instant with the other girls being able to do porn. It's really quick. But when you're on set, it's still incredibly different and far more difficult being the president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild. We're the union for porn performers, webcammers, content producers, phone sex operators, texters because we all work in the same fields, you know? If you do one thing, chances are you're doing everything. And so for us, it just made sense to be able to streamline all of that into one place and a big part of our membership is webcam models. Something else that we're dealing with is a new law in California called AB 5 and it is basically a court decision about independent contractor status versus employee status that is making many people that were originally independent contractors, freelance workers employees. And you know, it works great for porn performers. It's totally necessary so they have workers compensation when they're on set because they are at risk. You know, accidents happen. People fall. [laughs] I have fallen off of a stool with a dildo attached to the middle of it and hit my face on the floor on my way down. I know girls that have fallen outta chairs and hit their jaw on the floor and it broke in three places. Like workers compensation is important in that life. Can you imagine me being an employee from right here? This is my bed. That's my shelf. [chuckles] That's my ceiling fan. If it falls off, it decapitates me. [laughs] My homeowners insurance covers that. It's kind of my fault. So the idea of just something making us employees inside of our own homes isgonna cost the webcam companies a lotta money. And there are benefits to it, sure. We would get to keep all of our tips 'cause in the state of California, an employee can't take them. And as a webcam model, for many of the sites what the viewers at home don't realize if we're lucky, we only take home 32% of that tip. It means the rest of the 68% that you just gave us 'cause we gave you a really great show just went to the company owners and that's a hard pill to swallow for a lotta girls. I totally get that. I feel it because it's the same on all of those platforms we work for. But instead of complying with what is now the law as of January 1st, 2020, the companies are firing girls. When you're Uber or Lyft, if you fire your drivers, you don't have business in that state 'cause you physically absolutely need them. You can't outsource to a driver in Nevada because they have to be here. But when you're a cam company, that's exactly what you can do. You can shut off access to those states and basically fire your models across the board and that's what's happening. And you know, my organization supported AB 5 with the idea that porn performers were gonna be employees because that's what needed to happen. And now that it's causing my friends to lose their jobs because it affected people that no one understood, there was no mention of it until what, December 6, 2019? So couple weeks before Christmas, girls are gettin' fired. No idea how they're gonna pay their rent come February because they can't log in. It's crazy. So moving forward, there has been talks of a cleanup bill. And you know, I can't sleep at night. It's a real thing that's happening right now. And I know that this isn't my fault, I get that. But it's still hard to not feel as if I was a part of it, especially because they didn't understand how it was going to affect my own job. We're talking about how I pay my bills here. And so I immediately jumped to the ground. We contacted the California Labor Federation which is the union of all unions in California. They had a meeting with us. We brought webcam performers, discussed the concerns and what our fears were and they immediately told us about the cleanup bill that is working to create exemptions for people being affected in ways like my entire workforce and I'm really excited because at this point, this is where I realize that all the hard work that I've put into the union thus far is completely paying off. We already have a meeting set with the author of AB 5 because I know her personally and she's already spoken to the people with California Labor Federation. And at this point, completely understood where we were coming from was disappointed that this is how it's turning out and agreed that she would make exemptions for our workforce. So I'm really thankful about that. It's an odd position for me to be in where one side of my workers absolutely need this law and it's important for them and then the other side of my workers it just doesn't make sense for. And so, from that point, it's going to the cam companies. It's talking to them about these tip levels. Because the other reality is this law right now basically means that every single cam performer in the state of California can sue every single webcam company that they've worked for for backpay and tips and lost revenue since April of 2018. That's a lotta money. And it gives us bargaining power to have discussions about cutting those tips, giving girls more of the money that they're actually earning for themselves. Because as it is, they still only see 32% of that you know, per-minute fee that they're getting anyway. So camming has been a very crazy world for me. I got into it because it was fun and I enjoyed it. I play video games while I webcam. That's a big part of what I do. So for me, it's all about the entertainment side of it as well. But I certainly never thought that I would find myself in a position here where I'm fighting legislation for my job, to save our jobs and to try to bring the work back. Because I'm pretty sure that when you know, Lorena Gonzalez offered this bill, she didn't expect that people would get fired over it. I think it's really important for the fans to speak out, get involved, ask questions of the companies that you're giving your money to. If you start putting pressure on them about how we get paid, you can actually help make the changes for us. You know, we're a solid voice together. We're the workers, but it'syour money that they're earning and so are we. [chuckles] I always encourage everyone to vote. I think it's the most important thing, especially the girls in the industry. If you don't pay attention to the way that things are changing around the industry that you work in, you totally will miss the boat. And I think that's the biggest thing, that is the biggest lesson here because the cam companies had no idea that this was happening. They had no idea that this was affecting them in the way that it has. They didn't understand until December. I mean let's be real, I worked on the legislation in a sense. I helped, I marched, I spoke out and even I didn't understand that it would affect our jobs in the way that it did. And I think it's really important for people to just be involved and pay attention. A lotta girls talked about how they had no idea what AB 5 was, but we've been talking about it since March. [laughs] We've been talking about it for what is that? Seven, eight months before the hammer even came down and I think that's the biggest lesson that girls learn. You know, you can pay attention to technology. We all know the latest cameras that are coming out, which one's gonna make our skin look the best, which light is gonna take away the most shadows. We know every detail about that. I could tell you exactly how to make all the programs work. I'm a blonde. People would assume that I'mnot that intelligent, you know? I get it all the time. It's totally okay. [laughs] I think it's less intimidating to people. But we are our own boss. We create the entire facade that you see as a viewer. We put so much of our sweatand literal tears into our jobs and I think that we definitely deserve the compensation for it. We deserve the appreciation for it. But like I said in the beginning: we get it at the end of every single show. We know how happy they are or if it didn't go that well. [laughs] Let's be real, it happens. You don't always know. People have odd usernames, you know? If you come into my room and your name is Mr. Small, I might think that you're into small penis humiliation. I might start talking shit to you. It's not my fault. [laughs] It's happened. [chuckles] But camming is amazing. Unless technology changes and gives us the next new thing, in-room VR with body sensory technology, then this is where I'll be in my bedroom on my webcam. [chuckles] - [Dark Infinity] Next, we caught up with monster actor Alan Maxson, who provided us with a little insight on what it's like portraying some of Hollywood's most memorable creatures. - I am a huge fan of monster movies, even to the point where when I was a kid, I wouldn't buy a VHS or a DVD unless it had an alien or creature or monster in it. You know, it's like movies with humans only are boring. You know, if you're gonna waste two hours to escape from the world to watch a movie, why would you watch something that you can see in real life? I wanna see something that I cannot see in real life and that's where you have monsters and aliens and creatures and things that are awesome and visually beautiful to look at. That's what I think is cool about monster movies. When you watch movies, the most memorable character to me at least is always the non-human character and that's also the characters that I wanted to have the action figures of, you want the poster on your wall of. You don't want the human, it's boring. And so I sought out being a creature actor and I do not regret it because it is the most fun thing in the entire world and I'm gonna keep going until I can't. Because man, it's awesome looking in the mirror and seein' yourself as a monster. And when you're acting, to me, it's much more fun than acting as a human because you are otherworldly. There's no rules to it. You get to just let out the animal instinct in you to bring that character to life. It's so much fun. I love it. I've had a lotta very memorable roles that I love. One of 'em is I got to playthe right head of King Ghidorah in "Godzilla: King of the Monsters" for 2019's movie and we did that with motion capture. And that one will always stand out to me as special in my heart because it really changed the game for me and it really got a lot of attention and eyes on me and helped me to book future roles because of what we did in that film. That one is particularly special because most creatures you play by yourself, just like any other actor. But this one since it had three heads, they wanted a different personality for each head. And so they took three different actors and they tied us together and threw us in a motion capture volume and that's how we played it. It was great. It was a ton of fun and it was an experience of a lifetime. I hope Legendary calls us back for more. That'd be a ton of fun to do another one. That one stands out to me as a very memorable experience. And another one is actually I got to play Blade in the "Puppet Master" film "Blade: The Iron Cross." What they did was Tom Devlin had the regular-sized puppets that he would puppeteer. But then during heavier stunt scenes or running scenes or full body shots, Tom built a full suit to fit me and they filmed me on a green screen. And then John Lechago, the director, he just composites it into this shot that they filmed on set and shrank me down. So that was awesome 'cause I've been a huge "PuppetMaster" fan my whole life. It's just super cool to get to play a character that you literally had action figures of as a kid and you watch the movies growing up in your living room, you know? So that was a great experience for me. If anybody is interested in being a creature actor, all I can say is just train as an actor. I mean it's no different. You have to have the motivation, you have to have the character, you have to have a background and you just have to think about those things and the script and perform it. It has to be real and it has to feel real. You can't just snarl and bite somebody. That's not acting. You have to have actual thought and intentions as your character. So I suggest if you wanna be a creature actor, study real acting. Just be an actor and train physically because it takes a lot of endurance and strength and just concentration and patience really to do creature acting. You gotta be under a lot of heavy prosthetics and suits. So it can be claustrophobic sometimes, it can be hot sometimes, very uncomfortable sometimes. So you know, just train and be physically fit and in-shape. As an actor, I've played over I think 60 or more creatures all under prosthetics or makeup or suits. That's for TV, film, commercials, music videos. The whole kit and caboodle. But along with being a creatureactor, I'm also a filmmaker. I made two movies in the past. One of them is called "Christmas with Cookie" and the other one is called "Patina." Both are available on Amazon, on streaming and Blu-ray. So if you want to make a film, don't be afraid to start embarrassingly low. Just make stuff, just do it. Get out there. Alan Maxson signing off. - [Dark Infinity] In early 2018, California legalized recreational marijuana in most of the state. In a matter of days, there were new shops around every corner; some even offering their own delivery services. Deep in Hollywood Hills rests the High Church. No only can you score some of the highest-qualitymarijuana on this side of SoCal, but they offer spiritual awakenings in the form of a dab hit with any donation. Let's take a peek inside. Cameras, while not illegal, are forbidden by shop owners, so we were forced to go undercover to bring you the insight needed on this rapidly-growing new industry. Here, you could find nearly any strain you are after, whether it's Indica for a more energetic and clear high or Sativa for more relaxed and calm high. Different strains have different effects on the body. There are many strains recommended by professionals in this industry said to have the ability to fight anything from minor depression, insomnia and eating disorders to even some forms of cancer. With new research findings being released every day, we continue to learn more about the many benefits of the plant as well as the economic growth the state receives from taxing the product. With many other states following California's lead, soon the days of reefer madness should be over. And countrywide, it will become available to practically anyone in need. [dark foreboding music] After getting stoned at the High Church, we made one final stop at the nursing home of drag queen the Goddess Bunny, a model with a very disfiguring form of polio. She was all the rage in the late 80s and early 90s in the Hollywood underground scene. Her distinct odd body structure, combined with her sassy wit and fun personality made her irresistible to fellow celebrities. Even 90's shock rocker Marilyn Manson befriended the goddess, even giving her a role in his award-winning "The Dope Show" music video in 1998. Today, she goes by the name Sandie Crisp and resides at a nursing home in West Hollywood. We were able to catch up with her for a few moments and she was kind enough to reflect on some of her most memorable experiences as the reigning underground queen of entertainment. - Well back in the early 80s, I came to Hollywood basically to be, I'm out now, just a gay boy. I was living at a home by the name of Michael Venegas. Then a person by the name of Jackie Sekiro, who gave me a chair wench. They were having a contest for Miss Gay Universe and I started making a dress, trying on makeup, learning how to do wigs. Lo and behold, Bunny Victoria Venice was born. - [Dark Infinity] Amazing. - I was the first runner-up of Miss Gay Universe, opposite Heather Fontaine and this was back in 1981. - [Dark Infinity] And since1981, you had quite the career. You've done a lotta things with a lotta people. Do you wanna tell us about some of that? - Well I worked with Michael Jackson on "Thriller." I worked with Marilyn Manson, Dr. Dre, Gloria Estefan. I was in a play called "Boogieman" which was at the LA Theater Center and I've done odd jobs here and there. Last year I did a movie called "Scumbag." - [Dark Infinity] Wanna tell us a little bit about that movie? - "Scumbag" is about south central Los Angeles. Well if you watched it, you have to be smoking weed to watch it because that's the only way it makes sense. Basically it's about phone callers, people that call you to sell you something and what goes on in the offices of those phone company sorta things and what they get away with. - [Dark Infinity] What was your part in the film? - Well I go to this nightclub and the man who I'm drinking with gets jumped in an alley. And I pull outta can of hairspray and a lighter and I end up chasing the bad guys away with my hairspray and lighter. Using my hairspray as a flamethrower, I become the hero of the film. - [Dark Infinity] Sounds like a lotta fun. - Yeah, it was interesting. - [Dark Infinity] Do you wanna talk a little bit about your experiences that you remember working with Marilyn Manson? - Well Brian, as I know him as. Great guy. Great sense of humor. Very intelligent. I wish these women would stop thinking that he's this macho straight guy 'cause we all know he's not. I mean any man who wears more blush than I do, honey, tellin' people, "He's a drag queen," all right? Get over it, girls. So he's got a big schlong, get over it. Most drag queens do. Hello. [Dark Infinity chuckling] Brian called me one day and I was out in Echo Park. And he goes, "I want you to be in a video." I said, "Okay. "Who's it with?" "Marilyn Manson." "Well who is she?" [Dark Infinity chuckling] He goes, "Well it's me." "Marilyn Manson?" He goes, "Yeah, Marilyn Monroe and Charlie Manson." I go, "Okay." Interesting concept, all right? So show up. We're in back of the Superior Court building. Of course they have this great big old stage that's like 13 feet in the air. There's no way I can jump my wheelchair up this thing. All right? I can't climb the ladder. That's out. So basically the first day I got paid for nothin'. Second day we went over to Simi Valley and we used a museum that was shut down and this museum was a giant donut. And they put a Plaster of Paris over my boobs to make boobs on his chest. So you're lookin' at my tits, boys, on Brian's chest. Brian was such a sweetheart. During the 1998 MTV Awards, the costumer, hairstylist and makeup artist didn't show up. And the girls that were back-up singers, their dresses were still on the bolt of material. I had to act swift and quick. I called the supplier here of the Universal Amphitheater. Said, "I need a can of gold spray paint "and I need a can of pink spray paint." They sent it over. I put all the boots upside down on the parking pillars and me and my assistant spray painted all the pairs of boots pink and then the gold. The girls got the gold ones, the boys got the pink ones. They got all their uniforms on 'em. I had to sit there and make a dress over the girls while them laying down on the ground and we hot glued 'em into the dresses. And that's how the dresses were put on them girls. - [Dark Infinity] Wow, way for you to jump in. - And Brian goes, "I owe ya." "I'll say you owe me. [Dark Infinity chuckling] "Saved your bacon." - [Dark Infinity] Is there anything you wanna say to your fans then, that you'd like to say to 'em? - Well I wanna thank you for all your years of dedication on this old queen and thank you for all your warm messages I get on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. Yeah. You ever try fighting with the president of the United States on Twitter? It's a lot of fun, [Dark Infinity chuckling] especially since he comes ill-equipped with brains. - [Dark Infinity] Exactly. Well thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today. We really appreciate it. - You got it. - [Dark Infinity] This country is filled with all walks of life: the rich, the famous, the beautiful, the poor, the ugly and the weird and Hollywood is no exception. For in reality, there's beauty in everything, especially the strange and weird. We can learn from what we don't understand. And once we all understand each other better, we can grow together and take humanity to a higher place. This has been Dark Infinity. And until next time, stay weird. - 10 to is where I start to get hoarse. My voice is kinda hoarse. - [Dark Infinity] Oh, no worries. [soft foreboding music] Okay, so let's start with-- - I'm looking, looking? - [Dark Infinity] You can look into the camera. Yup, talk right to the camera. Okay, are you? - I had my dress picked. [chuckles] - [Dark Infinity] Looks beautiful. - [sighs] Anything that gives me the slim right now. - [Dark Infinity] Okay, so we're gonna start out. We'll have you talk a little bit about why you decided to step back from the film work and get into camming and more mainstream films. - Okay. - Whenever you're ready. - How's my language, clean? Does it matter? - Oh no, you can cuss. It's all right. - Talking about camming. - Yeah, make it as raunchy as you want. It's fine. - Okay. - Go for it. [dark haunting music] [dark foreboding music] [thunder crackling] [eerie vocalizing]
