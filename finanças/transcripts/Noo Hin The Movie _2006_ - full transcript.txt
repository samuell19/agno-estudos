Time has flown... like a Sky Lab with a turbo engine. I've been working in Bangkok as a House Manager for a year now. My beautiful boss, Miss Milk, is as beautiful as ever. Miss Milk, wake up. Sleeping Beauty, huh? And no blanket... Should I get you back? Then there's Miss Som-O, her sister. She's just as pretty as Miss Milk but very insecure. She's always looking for her flaws; and complaining all the time. Dry skin. Split ends. Circles under her eyes. Cellulite. When I see her in the house, lthink she's from another planet. Then last week, I met a handsome gardener next door. Boy, did sparks fly! We call it puppy love. I'm mowing the lawn because they're moving in next week. l'm Noo Hin from None Hin Hae. What's your name? My name is Tong. Such a beautiful name! Soon after that, I had my heart broken for the first time when I found out that he is actually... the son of people who live in that house. l was dumb to think he was the gardener. Noo Hin. But it's OK, because Miss Milk is keeping the dream alive. I'm fine with it, if it's Miss Milk. The relationship between the two houses has been growing ever since. There are many strange things in Bangkok. Especially with the women... ljust don't understand them. When they see a sale, they go crazy. It's scary. And they like to put whitening cream on their underarms. One for you... Thanks. Noo Hin, this is yours Thank you. But, everyone is nice to me, especially Miss Milk. Mom, you don't have to worry. It's for you. You like hair pins, don't you? Miss Milk. You are so kind to me. From now on, we are sisters. You are my angel from heaven. Miss Milk. I'm so touched. No one has ever been this kind to me. Take it easy. You don't like this watch anymore, right? It's late. I'm going to bed now. I'll write again soon. I sent you some money yesterday. It's getting cold now, so take care of yourself. Dad too. Noo Hian too. Love, Noo Hin in Bangkok. Toddy at 1 pm.
