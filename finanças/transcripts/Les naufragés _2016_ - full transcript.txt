Excellent! Attention! Breakfast time! Good morning lady! Very nice day. Good morning sir. Very nice day. Excellent. Good morning sir. Your gift, sir. What happened to you, Joel? For the lady, sir. - Christmas, right. - Birthday, sir. Exactly. Her birthday, Joel. Good day Sir. Jean-Louis called the Tax Office. - When? - The arrest warrant has been issued. Prepare my plane. I fly away. Impossible! They see Falcon. But I had planned before. I bought a ticket to Tortola, line up as a VIP immigrant. Fly to the right Costa Rico in no time. This is your new passport. Mustapha Muhammad? What is that? It was the only passport we could find urgently. We had no other choice. Daniel, do you think I'm like Mustapha? Mustapha, there is PH at the end. More respectable. More beautiful. It looks more elite. I found the story, Anne, a French archaeologist. I heard enough! So in his spare time. Merry Christmas! Daniel, I have already given your bonus. But that's not why .. I mean happy holidays! Follow me. Keep walking! Please Joel. This is embarrassing enough. There is no need for such a feeling. If we don't meet again before Christmas, I have a gift for you. Thank you. Stay a surprise for the trip. I was officially spoiled today. Have a nice trip, Mr. Mohammed. Have a nice trip, Mr. Mohammed. He's a little neurotic but hard to explain. Are you flying or not? I'm waiting for my fiancee! You've been saying the same thing since nine in the morning... ... it is now a quarter past two. I know I know. I can't guarantee the flight anyway with Hurricane Franklin. Say okay to the pilot. No, wait. Let's get together first. Wait a minute. Sandy, it's me. Never mind my other messages. Seeing you with a diving expert and then going out, ... it was pretty heavy. You don't even know him. One second, please. You've done stupid things with strangers before. Would you excuse me? Only priority passengers please. Excuse me, ma'am. Sorry, sorry! - I have a priority ticket. - OK. My mother. He's my mother. You're right, it's yours .. Damn .. Where did mine go? Mom? Mom? Call me. I know that there is a lot of suspicion in it. I love you, I kissed. I trust you will call back. This is it! Be good and forget me. He said he couldn't come. I'll fly one. I'm glad to hear that, but no longer a pilot. I have to leave this island. If I see him again .. I warned you. Don't ever regret. All the airline is closed. Dear passengers... I don't care, Daniel. Solve this work yourself. Call our contacts at the ministry. Stop calling me now. They came here. I can't speak right now. I'm not interested, lady! Evidence! - Come! - Immediately, ma'am. Gentleman? The news is bad. There are no available pilots, sorry. I have a plane to South Africa, but I don't have a pilot? Sorry. This is life. Nonsense! Nonsense! It cost me a fortune! - You have an airplane? - I hired it. For the world tour. Is it alone? Congratulations. - I'm glad. William Baker. - Mustapha Muhammad. Mustapha? Very different. Mustapha with PH. There is a little nuance there. You need a pilot. My plane too. My jet broke down, I can create a flight plan. I know its owner. Yes, we are ready to fly, but we have to be very fast. Where's your plane? WILLY AND SANDY FOREVER It was a fancy aircraft. What am I supposed to think about? This is the tower control. Do not take off. Hurricane warning! I repeat hurricane warning! Watch and see. - Is everything okay? - On your way. Is it okay or okay? It's not ok. It's definitely not in its way! It's obvious. - Stay in place! - Do we have a parachute? - Shit sit down! - Parachutes! No, I said sit down! - What will I do? - Don't move! Tobacco! - No! - Hold tight. Mustapha! Mustapha! Hold tight! Anyone here? Thanks God! I'm not alone. Where are you? I'm here! I'm here, Mustapha. Live! Moving! Help! Help! Hello there! Is there anyone there? Is there anyone there? Is there a friendly person? This place is like hell, it's a hell in the world. I've eaten alive. Did you get your own belongings? These work best. Thank you so much. - What work do you do? - I'm a craftsman. A craftsman! Finally good news! What craft? Dry cleaner. Excellent. My partner is a cleaner on an abandoned island. Anyway, it's better than nothing. Dry cleaning .. Because it's a handcrafted. Yeah. Lets! Go on. - Get the coconut! - What will I do? It's you there, not me! Nothing here. This is impossible! Look under the leaves! I'm already under the leaves! Then, come here. We try another one. Coconut does not grow in all palm trees. Are you waiting for Christmas to open? - A phone! - Telephone! Joel. Joel! Our last chance. Call a friend. Damn. These were the players! Whereas I distributed big bonuses. I am surrounded by idiots .. Do not worry. We fish and hunt. We'll handle it. What the hell are you doing! We have one flare. Neither aircraft nor ships, nothing is in the air! At least you found us souvenirs. Earrings are useless. If we suffer from a female shortage, she is separate. How is it ?! Warm but no fish. And the weather is very hot. No fish in the Caribbean? Walk around! Shake shake! Defraud the fishing rod! Shall I rock the fishing rod like this? It's done! What do you say about this? Is there a problem? No no. I will keep trying. If we manage to get out of here, ... I'll repay every penny. - My bag! - Give me good news. I feel bad, Mustapha. Do you want to eat them all? No, but these crackers are bacon. I don't know .. Are you eating pork? What I love about you is consistency. Thanks! Thanks. Amine! Could I have another one, please? The last one! We have to keep it. You will thank me tomorrow. This is crazy, all this water and... ... there is nothing to drink. Then I saw Sandy again. And the dirty bed linen were very harsh stains. I had my own shop The secret to being successful. Quality result with human touch. I printed my surname on the sign in capital letters. - What is your surname? - Yes. Baker. Cleaning. - Baker. Cleaning. - With different writing style. Of course. It has been remarkable. William. Bring my sleeping drops. I beat it alive. What about you? No thanks, they don't come to me. Help me. Stay near me. My stuff is here. Pay attention to my shirt. There is only this. Wait, what? - You're cleaning clothes. But I'm not your maid. Why is that? Isn't being a maid a respectable job? You really disappoint me. A lot indeed. Ugh! A real nuisance! Mustapha! Mustapha! Have you heard? Why is there nothing to eat here? This time, Mustapha, you will be very impressed. You sleep like a log, how lucky you are. Is it lucky? I'm losing my leg. Did you hear anything last night? I tripled the dose of my sleeping medicine. - I heard a drumbeat. - Drum sounds. Maybe they are cannibals. Cannibals .. If they're hiding until we get fat. What did you find food? Nothing! Think again. I found fruit. They are very strange colors. Will it be defeated? I do not know. We'll see .. You first. - Why me? - To make a division of labor. So I'm gonna die while you're laughing? There's a lot of food here. I smell it. Go and find it with your perfect nose! Nothing here. Except for something that can eat us! The best way out is to show ourselves. - What are you doing? - A help message. NO FOOD, NO WATER, HELP We can not beg! They throw us rice in bags! Draw a triangle. A help message for pilots. If I saw a triangle in the sand, ... I'd say a triangle. But this is not for you. Don't childhood, draw me a triangle. Let me think. If you want geometry, draw on that side. Enough! Let's split the beach in two. This is my side. You are right. Let's draw a border. Until it survives. Let's try to live together. This is healthier. And it is distant. This limit is curved! Did you take the tree? I'm not using a ruler. Colonial style. My line was drawn by the mother nature. No problem. Less work remains for me. I am a dry cleaner. Yes, I studied civil engineering. This is pretty bad deplorable, shameful, arrogant... The 80's are already over. Which game do you play? When your wealth is smoke, don't turn to me crying. How repulsive. Scoundrel. You crossed the border illegally! I can't even walk. There was theft. A cracker. My name is Mustapha, so I'm not a thief. Stealing is a sin, Mustapha. I'm starving. What is this bad playlist Joel? All the works of Mozart. Thank you, dear Joel. I am so hungry! In winter, Joel burns my fireplace. It is very ingenious. He is skilled in many subjects. - Is he your boyfriend? - Are you crazy? My butler. How should I know? You are troubled. I hate misunderstandings. Especially with Joel. Take it, let's see. 1000-15000 for fever. But the boards are wet, try 2000. - Keep me away from this. - From what? Mustapha from the drug trade. Another clich√©. The facts are simpler. My poor mother's legacy had a design shop. Buttons and items. The Caribbean was his dream. But unfortunately I'm here. Sandy's dream was also. With your money? You're a little too, too good. He always said that. I have to help others. I do not regret. Things could have gotten worse. Like losing my money. But instead, I made a very good investment. I can start life from the beginning. If you behave well, he will be good to you in life. - Where did you invest? - To Brochard. - Very bad. - Is there a problem? What is it! We are stuck on an abandoned island! Mustapha! Did you hear that? Mustapha! This sound again! Wake up! Cannibals have arrived! I have a gun. I am a black belt in sudoku. Are you human? Cannibals. They came! Let's go! Wake up! Mustapha! Wake up! Go away! No food here! Leave him alone! Mustapha! Get up! Go away! Go! Where's my snack? What is the problem? Didn't you sleep well? Pardon. Didn't you hear anything last night? When the monster attacks? While you pretend to sleep. A giant lizard attacked. What? I didn't pretend to sleep. Is it 250 pounds and like a fist? He was a monster! You were frightened by Salamander. It was certain that something was hungry. I also protected you! You've lost your mind. Every day, you find excuses not to do business. Just for your information. There are no giant lizards in the Caribbean. You can't treat me like this after what I've done to you! You should have thanked me. Start by protecting me from yourself. You never washed the laundry. I'm not your Joel. Sir? Be careful! Joel will not be spoken! If you were my butler, you were fired! ErUmdUr rebellious. - An airplane! - I was tired of slavery. They pass again. Signal flare! - No. - Yes. - When the beast attacks. - When the beast attacks? You also used our last flare. To kill the salamander? You're sick. I concluded that you are useless. It's even dangerous. I do not trust you. Let me say one more thing. We had no flight plans. You have become the person I hate the most. You're a vile. Hating you at least helps time pass. Make your own raft, don't even think about using mine. No problem. Mine will be beautiful. A little fun in the end! The cleaners are very ingenious. Have fun. Ll see. My purse! My purse! Mustapha! Hey! I'm alive! I'm alive. Mustapha's photo! We were close. Your beach is right there! How do I know, I don't even know you! What happened? - What do you want? - Why don't I have a photo? We're alive! We're alive! Why am I not in the newspapers? What is this? Mustapha! What did you do? What are these? Dirt! Hi girls. Welcome sir. How was your journey? - Rugged. - You two? By myself. So lonely. There is a hotel above. Below is the banned natural reserve, for the last Komodo Dragon. It looks very wild. - Your credit card? - My credit card? Yeah. I don't think I bought it. If you do not mind... I prefer to pay cash. Of course, sir. Your name? - Baker. - Baker is enough. We're used to it. We are very secret. I have nothing to hide. My family name is Baker. Actually, I'm a dry cleaner. But my name is Baker. - Sure, Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker. Music. Mini bar. This way. Bedroom. Toilet. Outside. Very strange. But everything is very good. Praise to Velvet Heaven. Paris, London, New York. The same sentence everywhere. Kill him. What do you think about this topic? I do not know. I will spend my money and go. How naive I am! Excellent! An excellent seafood platter. Grand Crulodic currant. How can I resist this sweet talk? It's delicious. You're such a sucker, William. SHARK FLASHED Thousands of customers were victims. Their houses in Deauville and Courchevel were looted. Orphan was born. Little Orphan as the name of Wall Street... ... Annie is wanted everywhere. The hunt for humans has begun. I hope you're away. Hey Mr. Whale! Mr. Balin! I'm here! I'm here! - Hi. - Hi. Are you following the Brochard story? Afar. Far too far. Good day Sir. What a sunny day. You look so tired, sir. - You can not guess. - Your chair, sir. Joel... Dear Joel .. This sounds so good. Only you can take care of me so well. Criminal partners too. He has a certain accomplice. - They eat for five years. Five years? 15 years if they spend their money! 15 years? What is your job? Cleaning. I am a dry cleaner. Hello? What!! Brochard was caught in Caracas. What!! Is he arrested? Caracas? What's he doing there? Still there. Damn. Mustapha !! Mustapha !! Mustapha !! Mustapha !! Mustapha !! Mustapha. Mustapha. Daddy. Are you? Is that really you? Yes, Mustapha. I thought his body would hit the shore. I see you miss me. Did you find your stuff? - Excuse me? - Did you change your clothes? Not really. The same clothes are elegant as usual. You're a sunburn, Mustapha. I'll come and see right away! - Do not go. - I'll be right back. Another hallucination. Fruit! There is fruit! I said it was full of food! Now you've changed your outfit. It is enough. Don't start again. You are worrying me. You couldn't escape from here .. Our fates are entangled. Willy. Can I call you Willy? Of course. Now that we meet, what should I say to you? I don't know... you can say Mouss! As my close friends say. - You never look like Mustapha. - Different, in the PH part. Albeit with PH. All right. Do you want the truth? - Yes. Okay. I don't look like Mustapha. I have been in pain all my childhood. My father was Beduin. My mom is also an archaeologist. Buttons and Items weren't they? Yeah. He had it too. An amazing woman. We have to make a raft and leave here immediately. It is better to wait for things to calm down. This place is like hell. We will leave here together soon. The wildlife over there ... It's really brutal. The other shore! If there is fruit, I can go there! It's Easy! You're safer here. I will bring you food. Less risky. I'll get your pills. Stay here. I'll be right back. Don't move until I come. This is the best for you. Thanks Willy. This might surprise you, but you're good not to die. Thanks! I always think of the dragon. - Do not worry. Is it really isolated? Can't she escape? It is surrounded by coral reefs. And there is a fence around it. - So he can't escape. Impossible. - Is that so? A dangerous predator. Good evening. Charly. General manager. In fact, he's the boss assistant. Charly? Impressive. I am coming. Happy holidays, Mr. Baker. I'm coming quiet. Good evening. Would you like something to drink? No no thanks. Are you back in France? Our salaries are blocked. The bank agrees. Not since our main shareholder began to be searched. Brochard made us all bankrupt. 30% of employees left. Do you have an idea? We can do a lot of work. Nobody complains. - There are no unhappy customers. - He's right .. I work in 5 jobs, I don't even count the hairdresser. They were shocked to see me cleaning. Good Morning. Where's my breakfast? I have to do everything. - Mr. Baker. - Yes? Good luck, Jimmy. How are you doing? Hard times. If I can help, tell me. Kill the name behind it. Sure. It can be done quite well. I have a few ideas. Do you want to see the perfect natural wonder tonight? I have one before my eyes. I meant the sunset. To watch from the bar. Sorry .. At 8 o'clock this evening? Hello? Should I chase everyone? - OK. - Sorry. Isn't there a jet ski? - Sorry. - That's a big problem. - I present my apologies. What will I do? Finally! Did you think you were on vacation? I've been waiting for hours. I am so hungry. - What happened to Sala? - There is no progress! Have you been awake too? What happened to your drops? I thought I would wake you up. I see you have found yourself busy. - Request. For you. - What's this? That. From the water source. 4 hours on foot. I used a tree trunk. Is it water? Well done, Willy. This coconut water made me diarrhea. - This is mineral water! What? Are you sure? - Yes. - Pretty unusual. "Natural mineral water. Nature is wonderful. You smell good this morning. So beautiful. I washed in the water source. You are quite a master in a dangerous environment. - I'm a craftsman. - Let's get to work. I've been walking for three hours and it's late. Let's work alternately. I'm exhausted. Understand me. Come on please. Part-time work is not enough. This is unfair. This is eight. Good job, keep it up. Now 12 of the lighter ones. Are you saying now? Were all these entanglements for nothing? We have made progress. We specialize. So .. especially me. I hate working like this. If we hurry, we do bad work. Day is over! Time to go to bed, go to sleep! Hop hop hop. Now to bed! Tue tomorrow! two drops. We walk to the water source tomorrow. I may not find it again. You too hard to walk. We go early. Tomorrow .. Come to sleep. Take it. You wake up at sunset. I'm so tired, aren't you? I'm not at all. Burn the fire. Of course. It helps you sleep. Come on, let's. How beautiful flames. Lets. Sleep time. - Take it. - Enough. I'm not tired. Are you in a hurry? No, but you act like a child. You need to sleep! Otherwise we will be tired tomorrow and we cannot do raft! Sounds like you're acting hasty. Did you fall asleep civil engineer? You ruined my meeting! It ruined my meeting! Despicable. Good evening, sir. How was your trip? So beautiful. Do you know where Charly is? He had to go. Emergency. When did? So the last time you washed clothes. Tshirt and socks can't scare me. A big crisis, sir. The sheets were ruined. White's white is my specialty. Hello ma'am. Dual-body Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãQueen! I never thought I could see. Partitions are inside out. It is very typical. I'm just an accountant. You have to be careful. This is officially nonsense! Mr. Baker... Dart game. - It is our tradition. - Of course. Come on William. Lets! You're unbelievable. I'm just a dry cleaner. I've never seen you during the day. Where have you been? Sea was. I love open spaces. Yes, I came from the mountains. How perfect. - Thanks. - Thanks. His last hope is mine. Like you and me. - Yes. Me and those like him? No no. A sick old friend. It's imperious and semi-senile - How good you are. - Nothing. I'm not a good person at all. I'm fine but not in that sense. - Sometimes I mean well .. - I'm not like that. Let's have lunch tomorrow. - Are you available? 31 of the month? - Is that all? Time flies. Of course. Only a hurricane can stop me. William! - Are you going for a ride? - Yes. Take me too. Sorry I can't take it. I promised to show Carlos the dragon. You can not show! Unless you throw chickens on the fence. - Peeling time. - Go peeling! Have you looked at the clock? There were too many drops. I slept for 16 hours. I'm not a newborn boy! Now you will get it on time I never slept! This road is very steep. We will never go back. Turn right .. right! I do this every day. I know where I'm going. Right from the baobab tree. What are you missing? - You stress me! I said right! My back ached. Enough. Something moved. There! Go look. - You look! - Go ahead. - Go. - Listen. Here is your water source. Yes, here is my water source. But it's not sparkling. Not even a little bubble? - No. - Strange. Give me my slippers. Joel, my slippers .. William, my shoes! It smells disgusting. It's not like your skin. How long should this insect repel stay? Until I started cracking. I have a feeling like you're lying. But I can't figure out why. This is my life. I can't change anything. Because he chose me. This is my life. Not hell, not heaven. This is my life. Yes! William! William! Aren't you happy? Didn't you come from the mountains? Do you prefer fondue? I love the raklet cheese. But when I get excited, my face is officially freezing. I'm so excited. How lucky you are for living in the mountains. I miss the cold! Ski jacket. Gloves, scarf and hat. I always preferred high altitudes. A wine from Savoie. This is fine. But it's a bit hot. No need for machine. It melts on its own. - You burned? - I'm fine. Are you okay? Didn't you get hot? Me? Are you kidding me? I've never felt this good. I'll make a good feast for both of us, Willy. How are you? - William! Are you okay? Children are not here? - They're out. In the woods. - In the forest... What are you doing? I'm throwing chicken. Come on Carlos! Not a live chicken, of course! So what is the ecosystem? A new kind! My son comes first. Nice move. Let your father try. We did it, little one! Going! Flee! Carlos? Carlos! Carlos? Carlos! How was it? It will burn from cooking. It won't be good. Carlos! Maybe you shouldn't shout so loudly! Carlos. Carlos! Carlos. Carlos. Carlos. This is that monster! Hello there. Bye. Disappeared. Go eat chicken! Thank you, William. - Thanks. Do not mention it. Here it is! Overcooked! He could leave a note! Mustapha! Are you okay? I Wiilia! I had dinner. It was a surprise. Now he is ruined. Come eat. Don't you eat Overcooked. Not that. I feel a little swollen. Very strange. You do so much exercise. I must admit, before his extraordinary return... ... it was a real hell. Now, it's like living in a postcard painting. We have angels that protect us. I have very good news. Really? What? Look at the castle. Swallowed by the sea. Now we can cross the rock. There is no need to hurry if we are feeling well right now. You said it was like a postcard. Are you kidding me? We have been fighting here for days. To fight? Don't overdo it! We survived. Tell this to factory workers! In the Caribbean, by eating fish from the sea. - No more! - What is this? Unbelievable! A wild chicken. - Wild? - Yes. A leash, wild chicken? Maybe it's a suicidal chicken. Come on, chicken. Come on, let's. Here I got it. Tomorrow, coconut chicken! An island full of surprises. We have a big day ahead. At least it makes sense. I'm very tired too. Happy Birthday! There is no point in waiting until midnight. Happy birthday Mouss. Everything will be even better. I hope. This is all you have done in the past weeks. The same ones always win. Thank you so much. The bad guys sleep peacefully. Do not worry. I'm sure he got the crime worth. I doubt that. It must be in a very comfortable place. Its elements are looking at it. It seems to me that... They cook and cut their nails. Dead skin. Like a foot peel. Do you feel the grains? This is beautiful. Did you like it? Such? Let's not exaggerate my dear. So this was it. Mustapha! Let the circus begin! Fresh fruit and water. You really look glamorous! One day sparkling, one day flat. I have some bad news. I prepared for the worst. There is a difficult sea in the north. We postpone our departure a little. Sorry. How much now? Do you think I'm an idiot? It's time to remove the pod in your mouth. Great confession. Look into my eye and... swear his name is Mustapha. Jean-Louis! Look into my eyes and get out. I trusted you, you goddamn traitor! After all that I've done. You caged me like an animal. To hide the number one community enemy... I risked my life. I can be lynched because of this! I changed my name and face. Just curious, how much do they pay? 500 thousand dollars? You're too far away. I will leave you here to die alone. Live! So far from you! Stop bothering me in the man now! Take your hands off my chickens. I have the best weapon here. I live here. This is my chicken! I'm sorry, little chicken. Franklin. You're finally here! All right .. Come on. Franklin. Come on. Is that just it? Open the gates of hell! Don't expect me to apologize! Lets! Come! You can't scare me! Come on! He's crazy! Moussa! Mustapha! Mustapha! Mustapha! Mustapha! Mustapha! Mustapha! JEAN - LOUIS MUSTAPHA KNOWED LIVED AS A TIRAN DEATH WAS DEAD Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. Dragon! It may be your field but don't start again now! I'm leaving my gun. - No, Willy! - Behind you! Monster! The twig scared her Very easily scared. Yes she is a female. Gisele helped me last night. I'm leaving here. I'll find a boat. No, Willy. I'm staying. This does not happen in hell. We'll both go together. Fuck the risks. It's over now. I say what you call hell home. Of course not. I'll bring you your juice. With or without gas? You do not understand. I have everything I need. What will you do here unless we do a raft? It's all about angle. You lift it very fast. You are right. This place is beautiful. Cleaners work everywhere. Isn't it ironic? Just at the beginning of the deal. Sit down, sit down! Very ugly, Giselle. You make me sick. Bit of heat. Against the fire. With this... we can stay warm in the future. Do you launder money? A little ironic movement for dry cleaning. Mustapha's treasure. I can't take this. - You will need it. - And you? - How will you handle it? - For the fire? With these old papers. Lets. I can't bear this much emotionality. I have something to tell you.. I stole the cracker. I was starving. We cannot break a good friendship because of crackers. It is best to admit. There is something I have to admit. The day you cooked fish .. I ate racket cheese. Hello, Mustafa. Hello, William. Good luck buddy. THREE YEARS LATER Let's go. Let's. Everything was done. Be careful. Queen of Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis part of the collection. You should not overload. - I'm sorry, boss. - Not important. - No problem. Come on, good day. - See you, boss! Is everything okay, honey? - Isn't it too hot? - I'm fine. - Is everything okay? - Yes sir. - How are you sweetie? - I'm fine. Hey Karl, you're not too busy I guess? I'm fine, sir. - Take it, Joel. - Thank you sir. - Call me William. - I can't say, Mr. William. I have a surprise for Charly. - What is it? - I can not say. - They're all ready to go. - Excellent! News about your friend. Leak Brochard continues to disperse its existence. To hospitals in India, schools in Africa. And today there is the opening of the orphanage in Los Montes. Are they a generosity movement, or getting rid of the system... A bench for...? This week, by the French, to Brochard... ... was named Man of the Year. He deserved. As usual, you are loyal. Brochard is a real Robin Hood. Will they ever catch him? It is far away and... I'm sure it is very well protected. I heard he was climbing the mountain barefoot in South America. I ask you all! Do you want? Thanks. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Karl! WILLY AND CHARLY ENDLESS HAPPY No, Giselle, not tonight. Lie in your own cottage. Let's go to bed.
