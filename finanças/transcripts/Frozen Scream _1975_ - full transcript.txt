(dramatic piano music) (waves crashing) - Ever since the creation of life, man has dreamed of immortality. But pursuit of eternal life has always been devoured by death itself. - [Kevin] Immortality. Why would anyone want to live forever in a world like this? (soft moaning) (splashing) (intense music) (screaming) (gasping) (eerie music) - [Tom] Hello? - [Ann] Tom darling, it's me again. Yes, I'll be home in a while. The fog is very thick out here and it's kind of slowed me down. - Damnit Ann, I worry when you drive up to see your folks. It's a lousy road, even in good weather. - It's alright, I'll be just fine. - Wait a minute. - [Ann] I'm still worried about you, darling. You still don't sound right. Are you okay? - Honey, you didn't have to trek out in this weather ahead of schedule because of me. I was just feeling a little upset this afternoon. Really, I'm alright now. - Well it's not like you. You sounded so strange. If you really want to know, I was feeling a little homesick for my own bed. Hey, can I get arrested if I make this an obscene phone call, or would you rather I save that for when I get home? I love you so, Tom, I'll love you forever. See you soon. - Yes Ann, real soon. I love you too, Ann. I love you. Hello, this is Dr. Girard again. Is Father O'Brien back from church yet? Any minute? Yes, please have him call me as soon as he gets back. Tell him it's urgent. Life and death. (mysterious music) (clock chiming) (phone rings) Father O'Brien, thank God. I can't hold off any longer, it's happening tonight and... (ominous laughter) Hello? Who is this? - [Man] Fear no longer, Tom. The angels will be there in a few minutes. Please be ready for them. (ominous laughing) - Beach station, could you connect me to Sergeant McGuire right away? Yes please. Tom Girard, it's an emergency. (quiet crashing) (suspenseful music) (clattering) (growls) - Judgement day, time to pay your dues. (gun fires) - Now, Tom! - No, Ann will be here any minute. (gun fires) (punching) (groaning) - This'll only take a second, Tom. (screaming) - [Ann] I'm home! Tom? Ah, no! - Don't fight me on this, Ann. You know this'll help to subdue those nightmares. - Needles frighten me. I'd rather have the pills if you'll give them to me. - Of course. - I've never liked needles, even before that incident in the hallway. - Nothing happened in the hallway. (eerie music) Your phobia is associated with Tom's heart attack. - You still refuse to believe me, don't you? After I found Tom dead, two men grabbed me and knocked me out with a drug. The same two men murdered Tom. - Easy, easy. That was a scary night for you, especially when the police arrived and found no evidence of what you are saying. No struggle, no needle. - He was murdered, I know it! - Ann, Tom called Dr. Johnson a short time before you got home. Tom said he was feeling chest pains. Ann, even you yourself said he didn't sound right on the phone. When Dr. Johnson arrived, he was already dead and you were hysterical. - I may have been hysterical, but I know what I saw and I know I didn't make it up. - [Kevin] My name's Sergeant McGuire. I'm a cop, and I was getting nowhere investigating the disappearance of two med students, until I found one of their professors, Tom Girard, dead. Girard had called me in a panic, but by the time I got to him, a colleague of his, Dr. Sven Johnson, was already there. Dr. Johnson insisted the cause of death was a heart attack. And I saw no signs of a struggle to dispute his claim, but everything was too clean, and when Tom's wife Ann said she saw two men running from the house when she discovered the body, Dr. Johnson and his assistant Lil Stanhope were there to convince her she was hysterical. The doctors seemed to have all the right answers ahead of time, and I figured if I knew more about this mysterious death, I might also find out about those missing students. So I went to see Lil Stanhope with the intention of getting to Ann Girard who was now one of her patients. - Can I help you? - I'm Detective McGuire. I'm here on a routine investigation. I was wondering if you might answer a few questions. - What sort of investigation? - Well now it seems some former students of yours have been missing. A Bob Russel and a Richard Kirk. Their landlady thought they were skipping rent, but some checking has gone on and it seems no one has seen them since your last seminar at the university. - I have so many young people in my class. But I think I remember these two. Very bright. I must say, I've been wondering about the reason that they didn't sign up for my new class. - Yes, well we were wondering that also. Some of their friends said they were very fond of you and Dr. Johnson. They went out with you once or twice, didn't they? - Not in a social sense. Some of my classes incorporate field trips to special locations, so. - Neither of the guys had any family to speak of, but Russel was seeing a young med student, Lisa Cochran. Do you know her? - No. - Oh well. I guess they were boyfriend girlfriend. She said Bob was participating in some sort of drug program headed by you and Dr. Johnson. - That program was on extended consciousness only. - Is there a difference? - Our experiments are on the order of mental concepts only, completely free of drugs, including cigarettes and alcohol. - If you say so, I'm sure it's true. But Lisa did mention drugs. - Instead of using drugs, I drug them with my knowledge or approval. I'm very busy now, and you seem to know more about my students than I do, so if you'll excuse me. - Just one more thing. A friend of mine was admitted here. Ann Girard. (mysterious music) Could you help me find the room number? - Why? She is my patient, but I just gave her a sedative. I'm afraid you'll have to see her another time. - [Kevin] A pretty bad acting job, I'd say. It doesn't take much to see through her indignant rage, but it wasn't the right time to press her. - I see you've met Detective McGuire. - He practically accosted me at the nurses' station. - He may be a little over zealous in his job. - And he knows Ann, he asked to see her. Tom made a mistake involving those boys. Suppose he's told Ann. I know there is going to be trouble, I just know it. - Nothing we can't handle. How's Ann's therapy? - She's still not convinced she was hallucinating. I hope she doesn't talk to this McGuire, considering our murder angle. - Ridiculous. Tom died of a heart attack. I signed the death certificate myself. - And but if Ann pushes for an autopsy? - You worry too much. - [Kevin] Of course she didn't want me to see Ann but what I was wondering was whether Ann would even cooperate with me once I got to talk to her. You see, Ann Girard was going to be Ann McGuire. She broke off her engagement for no apparent reason and the next day she was getting married to Tom Girard. - Perhaps Cathrin could stay with her for a while. Ann could use a nurse close by while she recuperates. - Why Cathrin? I could stay with her for a while. - Oh no, my dear. I am too fond of your company in my bedroom. - Sometimes I really don't know what I see in you, Sven. You remind me too much of one of your cold immortal creations. Maybe you appeal to some sense of danger and adventure in me. - [Kevin] It's always been a mystery to me why she acted so irrationally when it was clear she cared for me so much. So I figured with her help I may solve this case, and with Tom out of the way, I'll have a chance to win her back. - You can start on Ann's paperwork for her release tomorrow. How is she? - Asleep, I gave her a sedative. - Why don't you go have a chat? - Of course. Ann, are you awake? - Ann, Ann? Ann, Ann, Ann? - Tom. Why are you dressed like that? - Do you love me, Ann? - Yes Tom, I love you. - Turn around, Ann. Undress for me. (intensifying eerie music) I love you, Ann. Forever and ever. (screaming) - Good, you're awake, that's good news. You can go home today. (mysterious music) You're a little anxious about going home, aren't you? That's normal. Ann, I hope you don't think I'm being pushy, but I feel at this stage of your therapy it would be good if you were to mingle again, date, maybe even go to work. - I think I really just want to be left alone for a while. - Ann, to isolate yourself now could be very damaging. Depression might set in. Come back to the university. - I don't think so. - [Lil] Why not? - Because I'm upset with you. - Why? - You promised to help me decipher my dreams, you haven't said anything about the one I had last night. - Oh that's it. I thought you might be able to analyze it yourself, it's so obvious to me. - What is? - Halloween night. The beach, Father O'Brien, Tom. We were having a celebration. Cathrin went swimming, remember? Cathrin, come here please. Aren't you getting cold? - No, I'm not cold. - Cathrin will tell us when she's uncomfortable. Won't you, Cathrin? - What if she gets too cold? - Actually, I'm more concerned about her being too close to the fire. Let's add an extra hour to her therapy tomorrow. At this stage I'd hate to see a setback for any reason. - She is your best work, Sven. - Yes, she is. When are Tom and Father O'Brien coming? - Here they are. - The good father and I thought some fortification against the cold. - He was like this when I found him at the rectory. - Don't worry, it was good brandy, makes you forget all your problems. - I'm afraid it's my fault, I wasn't watching how much he was drinking. - Oh no no no no no, it's not your fault, it's not anybody's fault. You know guilt is just an outmoded concept. Kind of like the idea of a soul, just ask any of my students. - Are you alright, Tom? - Yeah, just fine, Sven. Just a bit reluctant to go leaping into the brave new world. (dramatic music) Have you ever noticed how cold Cathrin is? She's like walking ice. - Tom! Tom, come here. Tom, you're acting like a fool. Get your head together, you're talking too much. - Talking is good for the soul. I can't say that, can I? I haven't got a soul. - Listen, Tom, I'm not gonna let your little guilt trip spoil this project. - I'm not going to guilt, I'm going to hell. (ominous music) - Will you all please form a circle? Before we begin, I would like to thank you all for a wonderful and enlightening semester. (suspenseful music) (tapping) (screaming) (intense music) - The concept of immortality or life after death is rarely celebrated in the American tradition. With the exception of this night, Halloween, which is why I chose to end my class at this time. Being All Souls Eve, I have asked one of our guest lecturers, Father O'Brien, to help us with the ceremony. Father O'Brien? - This evening in older, quainter times was not one that was primarily concerned with cold shadows or vague specters or trick or treaters. But it was a celebration of the spirit of resurrection. The circle of fire represents the sun which is the symbol of the immortal Christ. And with this in mind I'd like you all to join hands. - To immortality, Father. - Of the heavenly kind, I'm sure. - [Students] Love and immortality. Love and immortality. Love and immortality. Love and immortality. Love and immortality. - [Sven] Grant us now our humble boon. - [Students] Love and immortality. - [Sven] Oh lord of night, (mumbles). - [Students] Love and immortality. - [Sven] Call out now beyond the moon. - [Students] Love and immortality. Love and immortality. - This is all very pagan, isn't it? - [Sven] Oh fire bearer-- - Well, it's a bit exuberant perhaps. I think it's just students having a good time. - This thing about immortality. Do you think that's pagan? - Well not really, most religions have a concept of immortality of course. - [Students] Love and immortality. Love and immortality. Love and immortality. - You want to tell me exactly what's on your mind? - On one condition. It has to be under the seal of confession. - Alright. Will you excuse us, Ann? - Of course. - [Students] Love and immortality. Love and immortality. Love and immortality. Love and immortality. (eerie music) Love and immortality. - [Sven] Render us. - I have to go back to the hospital. Sven and I are just loaded with work. Give some thought about coming back to the university. You could help Sven and me finish Tom's research. - I'll think about it. I always felt so uneasy about Tom's work. - Surely immortality doesn't frighten you. Living forever. After all, that's what most religious philosophies are about. - I don't know. - Well, anyway, get some rest dear. See you tomorrow in my office. - Okay. (humming) (intense music) - Sorry I startled you. Didn't Lil tell you I was coming? - What we call death is one stage of being or non being is merely a changed state. Often temporary and sometimes curable. I'm frightened, Sven. - About what? - What we are doing is wrong. We are interfering with nature. - We are doctors. We interfere with nature every time we arrest the course of a disease. - But this is so different. The things we create are not human beings. - Perhaps. But one of these days our experiments will create immortality. - Immortality. Did I ever tell you that I was married? - No. - John was in the army so when the Vietnam War broke out they sent him overseas. He didn't want to go. He, we both knew he wouldn't be back. So I was not surprised when I received this letter. We regret to inform you. I did not cry, just went outside, sat on the porch, I did not even think about John. All I could envision was how incredible it would be if life could go on. Immortality. (eerie music) - [Kevin] Love? If you ask me about love I'd say it's a lot like life. When it's over, it's over. I've never been one to sulk or go soft, but I'm sure of my love for Ann and hers for me, ours was the kind that would go on forever. Then she had to ruin it by running into the arms of that Dr. Tom Girard. - [Sven] We're so close to making that dream come true. - Immorality. - [Kevin] With Ann out of the hospital, I followed her to school to talk to her there, but how could I talk about Tom without sounding sour, and convince her to help me on this case? - You have asked me whether I, as a physician believe literal immortality is possible. I have to say, the problem is the definition of death. All men are mortal, all men must die. We may as well say all machinery must break down. We are, after all, very much like sophisticated machines. But we know, with proper maintenance, and repair, a machine can go on working indefinitely. The same holds true for the human body. The Greek letter theta stands for thantos, it's the word for death. The bar above it cancels its meaning. Potentially, each one of us is athonatos, immortal. Death is a stage we can conquer. It is curable. We can live forever. - And that leaves plenty of time for messing around. - Oh Kevin, you startled me. What are you doing here anyway? - Looking for you. They wouldn't let me near you at the hospital. - I thought a policeman could see whoever he wanted to. - Well I suppose I could have pressed it, but they told me you had leprosy. I figured what the hell. - You probably thought worse things about me after our breakup and then marrying Tom. - I still danced at your wedding, remember? - Yes, I remember the wedding. - You're still very much in love with him, aren't you? Hey, if you need a friend, I'm here. - Thanks. You always have been, Kevin. - Ann, I came here because I need to talk to you about Tom. - What about him? - Can we go someplace else? A restaurant maybe? - Okay, but let me call Cathrin, she's my nurse. - Your nurse? Now let me guess, she's 80 and she doesn't smoke or drink and she won't go with anybody that does. (chuckles) (tense music) (phone ringing) - Hello? Yes Ann. No, go ahead. Have a good time. I'll be here if you need me. Hello? She's with him. - That's ridiculous. I know Lil very well. She would never be a part of anything like that. I've been to a few of the experimental sessions, which added up to nothing more than a few kids sitting around a circle, chanting, trying to raise the flame of a candle. - [Kevin] And Dr. Johnson? - Sven? He's a scientist, silent and analytical. - He has a private lab, doesn't he? - Yes, it's in his basement. Kevin, I know what you're implying, but I can't believe that they would be involved in anything that would deliberately harm anyone. They're doctors. - Ann, I'm not accusing anyone of anything. - You said you wanted to come here and talk about Tom. Well what does all this with Lil and Sven have to do with him? (sighs) - The stories go on to say that Tom had a hand in it. Ann, will you wait a second? Just wait a minute. - It's easy for you to blacklist him, isn't it? - Ann, I'm not saying that Tom murdered anyone, I'm just saying he's part of the puzzle I'm trying to solve. - You didn't try as hard to solve his murder! - There was nothing in the report to suggest that he was murdered. - But I saw it! - Ann, you've been under a lot of pressure. - I saw him murdered, I did! - Okay. Okay. Easy. It's clouding up, let's go back to the car, huh? - Okay. (gentle music) I just wish you believed me. - If it's true, we need proof. I'll need your help. - What can I do? Everyone thinks I'm crazy. - I know that Tom would never hurt anybody on purpose, but I can't help but feel that Dr. Johnson had him caught up in something mysterious. - Something that might have lead to his death? - Maybe. Listen, next time you're in Johnson's office, see if you can find anything that relates to his experiments like old records, charts, anything that might be helpful. - I'll try. - And go through Tom's files as well. See if anything there relates to Johnson's. Listen, did Tom ever talk with anyone outside the university? - I think he talked to Father O'Brien. In fact, last summer he went to confession. - And? - Father O'Brien wouldn't give him absolution. - That's strange. Listen, I think maybe we'd better go see Father O'Brien first thing in the morning, okay? - Okay. - Alright. - Have you come to any conclusions yet? - Possibly. Her physical temperature hasn't risen. But her emotional tenure was very heated. Psychologically she may have triggered a malfunction in her prefrontal circuitry. - Then we attend to that, then what? Will she be as unstable as before? Will she end up like Tom and Russel who are more like monsters than anything human? And Kirk's behavior is rapidly bordering on a pathological state. You are responsible for that. You sent him on this terrorizing errand. - It was something that had to be done. I'll put a stop to it tonight. I am aware that we've had some minor malfunctions. The cranial circuitry will have to be perfected in order to keep the body temperature low enough to retard the aging process. But in time, future generations will have achieved the ultimate in religious and scientific vanity. Eternal youth. - [Lil] But so many failures, Sven. - Our last experiment was successful. Would you like to have another look at him? - Tom? (sighs) He scares me most of all. - Then let's prepare for a cranial incision. I want to inspect the circuitry. - I realize the importance of what both of you suspect, but I cannot reveal under the seal of confession anything. - But what about all those other times? Did he ever say anyone was threatening him? - No, but he did try and reach me the night he died. My housekeeper said he was very agitated. - Yeah, he tried to reach me also. I'm sorry Ann, I should have told you earlier. - I can't believe Tom had any enemies except maybe his own guilt. The work was too straining for him and left him feeling very uncertain with himself. I do remember something curious he once asked. - Yes? - At one time he asked me whether I believed rats had souls. It had something to do with a private experiment of Dr. Johnson's. He was using a curare poison to paralyze rats. Then he would revive them at a lower temperature on the theory it would retard the aging process. The thing that seemed to upset Tom most was that when the rats recovered, their personalities were altered, diffused, almost soulless. If they were human, one could almost say that they were without souls. But that's absurd, of course. Only human beings have souls in the strict sense. - Did Tom ever suggest that Dr. Johnson planned any such experiments on a higher order of mammal? - If he did, that would be a matter of confession. If you'll excuse me, I have some people waiting for that purpose now. - Thank you. - Yes, thank you Father. (ominous music) - [Man] I have sinned, Father. - Yes, tell me your sins my son, yes. - [Man] I have sinned against the church. Therefore I need absolution. Absolution, Father. (laughing) (screaming) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Tom] Ann I'm cold, help me I'm so cold. - Who is this? I'll call the police. - [Tom] Ann, my body is so cold, numb, help me. - Hmm! (gasps) (screaming) (intense music) Cathrin, wake up! (crashing) (phone ringing) Hello? Oh Kevin, thank God. Please come over right away. Someone's trying to break in! What? No, I'm upstairs. Alright, oh hurry, please. (creepy music) (screaming) (knocking) (crying out) - One sound and you've had it. I have a message from Tom. He says that hell is very cold and lonely. If you breathe one word of this to anybody. (crying) - Where were you? - I was in the kitchen, then I heard you scream. - Did you seen anyone else in the house? - Not a soul. What's wrong? - Your hand, it was cold as ice. Like death. - Ann is rapidly becoming a threat to us in our research and our relationship. It needs to be talked out now. - So what do you suggest? Do you know I won't stand the matter. I'll fight you on that, Sven. - We won't have to do that. Just transfer her from one existence to another. I'm sure Tom will enjoy the company. - Tom would be better off dead. - His problem can be solved in due time, I'm sure of it. But if you continue to pry-- - I know that tone too well. What are you hiding from me? - If my recent calculations are correct, you will have all the time you need to decipher that question. - [Kevin] You did have your door locked at first? - Mm hmm. - Why? - A childhood fear, I guess. Like keeping out the boogieman. - And you only heard Ann? - Of course. - I suppose you think I'm crazy then. - Just tired. - That's right, I'm tired of you acting like nothing's going on around here. I mean it's like you think that you-- - Come on. Come on, let's go. - What's the matter with you? - Get in the car, I'll explain at my place. (eerie music) - Five seconds. - Stop your watch, let's try again. (intense music) Time? - Three seconds. - I love you, Ann. - Oh Kevin, it's like seeing a whole different world. - Well I don't see things, but I feel very close. - You think I see too many things, don't you? - No I don't. I know somebody tried to break in. Your front door was jammed. And there were footprints around the area outside your window. And your sill had blood on it. It all matches what you said. - And Tom? You think I actually saw him then? - Maybe, or somebody made up to look like him. I've got a feeling that nurse of yours is in on this also. - How do I get rid of her? - You don't, not just yet. We don't want them thinking you're suspicious. Do you remember the favor I asked you? - Yes, I remember, but I did not think you would get here that early. Sven and I have a staff meeting to attend. - You go on, I'll wait for you here. - You sure you're alright? Cathrin told me you had again a bad nightmare last night. - Mm hmm. - We'll talk about it when I get back. - There's not much to tell, just a bad dream. I'll be fine. - Wait for me here. - I will. - [Kevin] I couldn't figure out why Ann wouldn't tell me she loved me. There was really no way to be sure what she was feeling, but I thought if she'd do a few favors for me and collect some evidence, that would be proof enough for the meantime. (eerie music) That's Richard Kirk alright. You're positive that he's the one that threatened you? - Dead certain. - How about this one of Russel? Do you know him? - No. - Alright. - Maybe Kirk is one of the men who attacked Tom in the hallway. - The night Tom was killed? - I'm not so sure Tom was killed. If someone was impersonating him, I'd know it. He's alive, I'm sure. But-- - But what? - He wasn't himself. It was as if someone was hypnotized or programmed. Johnson's done something to him, and I intend to nail that bastard good. - Now hold on. You're probably on his list already. I don't want you taking any more risks. - If I'm clever, there won't be any. Look, I'm invited to Johnson's house next week for his annual Halloween celebration. If it's any kind of party at all, I should have no trouble getting a look at his private lab. - And then what? - If I find anything connecting it all, I promise I'll call you as soon as I can. Whether or not I find anything.

She's probably helping Lil. - In any case, we can't trust Ann to play the frightened rabbit any longer. As soon as she leaves tonight, you're free to do as you like. I made you strong and skillful. Therefore McGuire will have a difficult time assembling things other than clues to your disappearance for a long time. - I don't think it's necessary that Lil know about this.

(screaming) (laughing) No, no, no, no, no, no! - Stop right there, Kirk! Listen to me, Kirk. Can you feel what's happening? It's all over. Feel your forehead, Kirk. That's right, it's hot in here. Your usefulness is over. Immortals live in the cool of the clouds, but you are burning because you are in hell. (intense music) It's alright. He won't harm you now. (eerie music) I'm sorry we had to abduct you. - If you had stayed at the party tonight and minded your own affairs, you would not have been brought to these circumstances. - You're going to kill me, aren't you? Transform me into one of your things like Tom. - Don't be so ungrateful. We are going to bestow upon you a great gift, eternal life. - As a waxwork. - We hadn't planned it this way. We had many experimental errors and Tom and I am sorry he was one of them. - We really didn't kill him. You see, death was simulated by slowing down his body processes, then we revived him at a lower body temperature and injected a chemical acceleration of the healing functions to sustain life. The lower temperature is the prime key. The chill factor. It inhibits aging. Unfortunately, we cannot always calibrate this exactly. Some subjects are difficult to stabilize and therefore show signs of erratic and emotional responses. - It's you who're unstable. You forced them into something horrible on some vague promise of godliness. - Ann, we forced no one. - Tom had agreed from the beginning to simulate suicide. Unfortunately at the last moment he changed his mind, but it was too late. Once started, the procedure was irreversible. - I won't be one of your zombies. - But you will. And with a minor operation you'll be quite pleasant and manageable. - Sven, we hadn't agreed to that last part. - Don't tempt me, Lil, you'll make a lovely specimen yourself if you don't stay out of this. - Please Sven, don't make me do this! (gun firing) (haunting music) If I release you, will you work with me? Will you help materialize this dream? - A dream that creates monsters? - You don't understand. We'll perfect the process, we'll give them an inner life to compliment the immortal physical life they now possess. We will achieve what Sven never could achieve. There is a way. The dream will create a way. - Your dream creates death, not life. You'll kill me just as you killed your lover. - No, not if you'll help me. - Alright Lil, undo the straps. - Everything will be fine, you'll see. First thing we'll restore Tom to his rightful position. I loved him, Ann. But I never trusted him like I trust you. I know you can help me. - You don't know me at all, and as far as Tom's concerned, he's better off dead. - No, Ann! (buzzing) No! (exploding) - Oh, Tom. - You have killed him, but you have not killed the experiment. You'll feel a little cold for a while, but no pain, I promise. - I thought I heard a disturbance. - Father O'Brien, stop her, she's trying to kill me! Please Father, help me! - Of course I'll help you. (intense music) (screaming) - [Kevin Voiceover] Love and immortality? I survived being hit by the car, but I was having a harder time healing from being run over by Ann again. I hadn't heard from her since coming into the hospital. Things seem to have ended as quickly as they began. Could Dr. Johnson have been onto something? Could living as a frozen zombie forever be any better than facing the pain of things coming to an end? I was thinking I never wanted to find out when Ann came to see me and told me what I had been waiting to hear all along. - Ann. - Yes, Kevin. We were worried about you for a while. - We? Why are all these people-- - Shh, not now. I have something very important to tell you. I love you. - I love you too, Ann. - I'll love you forever, just you and I forever. (intensifying music) Love and immortality. - Love. - Immortality. (screaming) (haunting music) (funky music)
