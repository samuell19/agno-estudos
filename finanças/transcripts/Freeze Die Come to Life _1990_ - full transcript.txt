No matter how long my sentence I'll return to my beloved doorstep Longing for your caresses I'll knock on the window... In Kochi of Tosa At Harimaya-bashi... Are you crazy? That's boiling water! "Thanks to Stalin the Georgian Who clothed us all in rubber" "Thanks to Stalin the Georgian Who clothed us all in rubber" Gimme more! Are you begging again? What do you want? Are you blind or what? Tatar, I'll get you. I'll cut your head off. Hot tea! Tea! Hot tea! Valerka, we're celebrating. You want to join? From behind the dark forest, they carried him enormous Carried him on seven oxen He, poor boy, was chained and shackled One woman didn't believe it Sat on her... and measured What are you carrying? You think you're the only smart one? Devil knows what day it is... Get it here cheaper! Who wants tea? - Get lost, kid. - Tea. Who wants tea? Hot tea! Don't drink hers. She gets her water from a rusty pump. I'll kick you, you jerk. Only I have spring water tea. Buy some tea. O.K. kid, give me some spring water. You rip me off and I'll take a rouble from you. It's pure spring water I swear. You're my first customer, you can have it for free. After such a binge, you may as well give me another shot. I don't have change. Wait a second. I'll sell some more and get your change. - No, give me my change. - I've got change. Hey girl, got any tea? - Take mine, it's spring water. - Get out of here. Who wants tea made with spring water? Come and get it. Vaska... You crawling snake... A rascal... Well, of all things! Vaska! Let's go to my place. Cornflowers, cornflowers, how many there were in the field I remember I picked them by the river for Olga Olya picked a cornflower, and bowed her head Look dear, the cornflower floats, it doesn't sink Oh Vaska, my brother. Hey! What're you doing? You! Why you... I'll bust your head open... So cute... Hush! Close the door, you'll let the cold in. Look what I bought. We'll feed you now. Where should we keep him? - He'll get stolen in the shed. - He'll die in the shed. We'll make a place for him in the corner. Give me that bowl. It's cold on the floor. Water freezes overnight and he's all naked. - So where should we put him? - He can sleep in my bed. A pig in bed? So what? He's so small, with such smart eyes. I can train him to poop in the box. - Oh my precious! - It's a girl. - What'll we call her? - Mashka. Vic where have you been? Relaxing in jail. - Would you come to us? - I don't have time. Mama the doctor can't help me I fell in love with a girl She doesn't want to hear about love She thinks it's only a trick She is blonde She has big, blue eyes Her skirt made from Charleston fabric Such cheerful girl, like a dragonfly Her skirt made from Charleston fabric Such cheerful girl, like a dragonfly The police should take him. He can't be let go like that. That's no way to beat someone. They caught a thief. I can see that. Stop that. What're you doing? That's enough, take him to the police. Otherwise somebody'll have to answer for such shit. He could croak from fear. The victim should go with him too. Ah you scum, beat him for all you're worth. Where'd you get the money? From me? What is it? - Give it back it's mine. - I found it under the pillow. You trying to get me thrown in prison? I'll kill you stealing from your own mother. - I didn't take it. - Money's gone from my purse. Keep an eye on your lovers. That's none of your business. - I earned that money. - Where? At the flea market. Ask Galia. Galia. Come here. What's the matter? Where did Valerka get money? He bought skates... He sells tea at the flea market. What? Hot tea... Rouble a mug. That's great. My son the junk dealer. And mother learning about it from outsiders. Maybe you don't need me? It's your fault. Stop taking him to the work zone. Why isn't there vodka on the moon? Want to play a little chess? You had to learn, smart-ass. You lose - you give me your mother. You win - you take whatever you want. You give the country coal. Powdery, but a lot. Quantity prevails over quality and no place to hide. How long can you dig a hole like a mole? Isn't it time we devoted ourselves exclusively to us? Am I right? Absolutely right. How is it better done: together or separately? Better separately. Valerka, I'm going to work. Shut the pipe on the stove. I'll get an oak stake And cripple all the devils... Why isn't there vodka on the moon? - Get it? - What? Vic has fallen in love with my mother. You just figured that out? Why does he act like that around her? - She loves him, and he doesn't. - If he was a little older... All the same, nothing would come of it. Don't be smart. We'll see how you act around the girls. - Me?! - You. Never. Forget it. Let's go skate. You'll fall on your nose. I bet I won't. I already got it all figured out. - Let's go skate, O.K.? - I'm not going. You gonna sweep up trash again? Cleaning lady. Snotty Tatar. You're a fool and it's terminal. Two against one? Alright, I'll get you yet. They snatched your skates? Sing! Ebullient, mighty, no one more powerful... My country, my Moscow, you're the most lovable - Valerka, you sick? - What makes you think so? You've got the eyes of a crazy man. I'm trying to figure something out... What's going on? Forward march! Are we supposed to march through shit? Stop! Silence! Even out the rows. Form two deep! Forward march! Sing "Ebullient..." - Ebullient... Stinking! - Stop! Who said "stinking"? Leave the row right away. It will be worse later. Attention! Forward march! Sing! Keep in step! Faster! - You called me, comrade Headmaster? - What is that?! Err... you know... I don't know nothing. I ask you again - What is that?! You see for yourself... shit! Shit, but where's it coming from? From the school. Some pranksters poured yeast in the latrine. It fermented and brewed over. Flowing without restraint. What can I do? The elements of nature! It's a breach of official... You know what you get? Did I make the mess or something? My technical worker got sick. Don't worry, it'll lose strength and quiet down. We have to wait. You could march in another place... I don't need your foolish advice. Do as you're ordered. Oh, you... ugh! - They got rid of you too? - Yeah. I don't wanna... - ...to sing hysterically. - We're a disgrace to them. - Have something to eat? - Don't kid me, dude. Who tossed the resin? You want to see a trick? What? Say you caught a spy in the forest and you don't have a belt, or a rope. Only a stick. Could you bind his legs and hands so he can't escape? - Alone? No. - Wanna bet? What do I need to know for? It might come in handy during your life. I'll show you. What are you afraid of? It's the Japanese method. I don't want to get dirty. We'll tie you standing. Come on. Lift his hands. Do it. On his fist. - O.K. Such a fool! Gotcha! What're you doing, bitch?! Shithead, I'll show you. Now I'll show you... cocksucker. Nervous type. You offended or something? - Fuck off! - We were just joking. Nervous type. Well, did you figure out? - What? Who the two strangers were? I'm having trouble. Well, I figured it out. I know who stole your skates. Who? They're from our school? No, he lives far away, you don't know him. Ah, "you won't see from here"? I know. You're just pulling my leg. Valera, when your classes are over... We'll go together. Wait for me after school. He made a mess here and still he threatens us. Children you have to come to the school orchard. Here's a pear for you, an apple for you. This coin is your advance. If you work hard you'll get more. You'll get more... Shit on your shovel. What're you doing? You were brought here to work - so work. Goddamn intelligentsia. Don't leave the zone. If you're so sick go to the hospital. Stinking vermin. Too few of you in jail. Clean it up, carry it there. God it smells, I can't breathe. STUDENTS, EDUCATE IN THE SPIRIT OF HIGH POLITICAL VIGILANCE! It must be found. We'll look for it. Who stole the fountain pen? Return it right now. Well... After the bell... The class will stay here until... ...the Chinese fountain pen is returned. Understood? Close the door. Sit down. What do you want, Khabibulina? Vasilyev, come to me with your things. Hurry up. Here. Go on. Quiet! Let me go, too! I have to get home. - What did you blab? - I told the truth. - About the skates? - No, about your pig. - Stop teasing me. - Did I scare you? That blabber mouth will tell everybody... ...that I sleep in the same bed as a pig. Sure, I won't tell anyone. I lied, I said you were leaving. - What's gonna happen now? - Nothing. She'll go see my mother. You know she wouldn't lie. Why are you such a chicken? What'd you have to lie for? Now get me out of this mess! - I'll get you out of it. - Oh, aren't we brave! If you're so smart go get the skates yourself. Galia! Wait! I don't even know where the scum lives. Your skates are there in the hall. There's no one at home. - Is there a dog? - No. Faster! Maybe tomorrow. Today we'll just investigate. What's there to investigate? Get going or I'm leaving. Yes. Right there. Open it quick or else it'll squeak. Here? Get going. Be brave! I've got the skates! - Genka, what did they snatch? - My skates, the scum. Get the little bastard with a shovel. Fuck! Gods be damned! Why you got him in the head with a board? I'll catch you! Assholes! Filthy dogs, I'll show you how to steal. That was great, you got him in the head. There was snot pouring out his nose. Don't drink it she's got cockroaches in her can. She mixes them in with the tea. Get lost with your stupid jokes. Or I'll hit you. Some joke - cockroaches in your stomach. Look, there's nothing. They were there, maybe somebody swallowed them. Everybody come and get it. Hot tea. Made with pure spring water. You throw like a boy. Taking aim... missed me again! Come on! Damn! Well, good bye. In Kochi of Tosa At Harimaya-bashi A priest bought a hairpin Yosakoi, Yosakoi In Kochi of Tosa At Harimaya-bashi A priest bought a hairpin Yosakoi, Yosakoi What did he bring? What did I order from you? A cupboard? Cupboard... - What's that? - Cupboard. Damn Japanese! Who are you trying to mock? I'll shut you up in that cupboard. Bring me a cupboard tomorrow. Stinking Japs. Genka's dad did that to you? I'd have him thrown in jail. - What'd you sit down for? - What, can't I or something? Mama, I'm hungry, I'm tired. Valerka, take a walk. You stay out all day and now come home on purpose. I'm hungry. Mom, give me something to eat. Valerka, what are you doing here? Nothing... Be a sport! Take these forms to my uncle. He's standing in line for flour at the store. Can you do that? Alright, I don't have anything else to do. Go for it. - Who are you, a miner? - A miner. I've never seen you before. Don't let him through. You get it twice a year and... You say thank you for it. Ask for his certification. I've got one, I've got one. Don't cut in! If you're entitled for flour, then stand in line like ordinary people. Take your certification. What did he show? I want some small white pancakes. Don't yell, she won't give it to you. Don't look at me like a wolf, I'm not guilty of anything. Enough battling with the women, give me your sack. I'll give you some of my flour for pancakes. Give me your sack. Don't you have a sack? - No. - Good-for-nothing sort. Were you going to take the flour in your pocket? Why is it taking so long? Pancakes... Little white pancakes. Little... white... pancakes. That's Abram... a scholar from Moscow. - Who told you that? - Vovka told me... His father works as a guard at the zone. Has he been decommissioned? They let him go 'cause he's crazy. I'll be back by September Forgive me my mother, forgive me Take me home, dear mother The camp court convicted me a second time We probably won't meet again My mother, they gave me a long sentence Like the soldiers who served under Peter the Great Kiss the girl with the black eyebrows I have not the strength to do it myself... So farewell, my mother, farewell So farewell, my love... I'll come to meet you. I swear by my life. From this very moment... you'll be dearest to my heart. Don't be shy. Give me your hand. Touch me, caress me. I know I lost a lot of weight but my skin is clean. Oh please. Are you afraid you can't? I need for you to... You know... It's my last chance... I beg you! Just relax and it will be O.K. Don't be shy. It's something else. Look at me. You are a man. You can't? Here let me help you. Where are you going? Don't leave. You're like a child. I didn't mean to offend you... If you're shy then close your eyes. Don't leave. I beg you. Wait! Stay with me. Please! Let's talk. I'm the youngest in the zone. I'm only fifteen. You can help me get out of here. I know. Traitor... You can do that. I beg you. If I get to go free... ...you'll be dearest to my heart. Please! Scum! Idiot! Bastard! You can help me... I know that... You want to kill me? Well, kill me then. Jerk! Scum! You're not a man and you will never be. What did she want from him? Don't you understand? I wasn't listening. They could have caught us. - She wanted a child. - What child? You really don't know anything? What should I know? Soon pregnant women and women with children will be freed. She has a long sentence. They all have long sentences. There's thousands of them. Where have you been? At the work zone? - No. - I left a note for you. Meet me today. - I remember. They club your mother in an alley and you'll remember. There's a dance at the club today. All hell breaks loose. Dance-schmance. There'll be a fight. I still want to dance. - But you don't know how. - Me? It's easy. Foxtrot: "Everything's great, my beautiful marquise..." Tango: "Sasha, do you remember we met without pants by the sea?" I didn't write the song. - You don't know how to waltz. - Why, I can't spin like a top. I'm dizzy. Your knees are weak. My knees? Why, you Japanese cop. Akira, how are you. I brought some tea. And that's that. Well, hello. How's life, young man? How our guys driving your guys out. Hello, professor. Cold? Let's trade. Warm up your bald spot. Listen to my command. Wait! At my command! Quick march! Fall out! The moon, has come out, Oh, the moon is out, heave ho Over Miike Coal Mine the moon has come out The chimney is so high, I wonder if the moon chokes on the smoke... Heave Ho! Learning to speak Japanese? From him?! He only talks about one thing, "Tea, tea", is all he wants. - He won't teach you. - I want to learn. The main thing is more tea. Tea is good. The snake! He understands. He understands tea's good. He asks for tea but doesn't want to talk to me. Oh leave him alone. Now it gets interesting. Come with us to the work zone. - Can I? - Dad's got permission. See you later, you old fox. And what would the Japanese do with their prisoners? They'd make them work too. Those who fought with them tell some horrible stories. Better off not getting caught by them. I have to meet my mother. Will your dad take me there? Ask him yourself. Uncle Shamil, will you go to the club? I have to meet my mother. Jump in. Samurais smile happy with their gold teeth. Dogs, to hell with them. Bitches. Jackals. - Do you eat rice often? - I've never eaten it. And you never will. What are you doing hanging around here? - How about a drink? - I'm waiting for my mother. - Looking for a tit? - Fuck off. Don't hang around here in your coats, you thieves. You've come to a cultural establishment. - Why don't you guard the place? - We've got order. Order! Cigarette butts all over, and hooligans. Disgraceful. The boss tells the people: there's no coal - move the dirt. Police! Let's get her, men! She's got a stash in the cabinet. The dance has been postponed. Farewell march! Turn off the lights! COMRADE STALIN - THE FLAG BEARER OF THE WORLD! They don't know how to fight. Bumping around like women. - Why so early? - They all got drunk... ...and broke a glass case. Who's that? What's he following us for? Vic, come here. - What Vic? - My brother came. A huge bastard. He'll cut you up. You'll work all your life for medicines. I can't go on. Fed up to the back teeth. I'm quitting that job tomorrow. Why did I agree to work there? Thieves everywhere. Listen, Mom. Leave the receipts in the cafeteria. Hide them there. They'll steal them, the pigs. And I'll go to jail. Nobody needs us. Each one cares only for himself. Mama, you need to get married. Unlikely. Tramps like me sell it cheap on nickel night. I will be here until Bon Festival, After Bon Festival, I will not be here If Bon Festival comes earlier, I would return home earlier Will you ever stop taunting us? You'll have to wait a bit. My nerves are shot. Ivan Ivanovich. All this is praiseworthy, but where... Where were you earlier? - No one called me. I found out yesterday. - From whom? From my son. He confessed everything and I decided to come to you. It's good you came, but we can't help you. Forgive him, he won't do it again. Central? It could happen to anybody. He's a smart boy. He knows the world's capitals, seas and oceans by heart. You can check him with a map. Apologize! People are waiting. In vain. He's not a prankster at all. You gotta be strict with him. Why don't you say anything? People are talking to you. Good. I have only 3 hectares. What are you doing? - Louder! What? - What did you do? Forgive me, but I'm ready to kill him. Our only yardstick. That's unforgivable. Forgive me, my head is spinning. I've worked my fingers to the bone raising him. You make a mistake - you tell people and they forgive you. I am right, aren't I? I beg you, let him finish sixth grade. Don't expel my son. Nothing more... The school has turned into a torture chamber. Will he never stop his sawing? It's unbearable. I beg you to forgive him for the last time, please. Even if it was the first time... ...the decision would not be in his favor. You see what you've done with your silly yeast. Where'd you think of such an idea? Yeast in the sewer. What will happen now? I shudder to think. What are you doing? Get out of here. Rotten sausage! Little shit. Wait! Carry on! Go! Do you live in this barrack? I live in this one, he lives in that one. Whose slingshot is this? Let me see... I didn't see any of our kids with it. - And you? - We've never seen it before. So you don't know whose it is. Did you see the wreck? No. Is it true they caught a spy? Not a spy, a saboteur. He wanted us to trust him. He's a spy. He sold our secrets to the enemy. I'd shoot such scum on sight. - So you don't know who did it... - Do any other kids live here? - Tons. So this is where you're hiding. I took you for a Japanese. - Did you cause the wreck? - What are you talking about? How could I have done it? I know you did it. You know, well then keep quiet. And what if they find you? Will that make you feel better? Why did you tease me? So that's it... And I thought... You thought I was stupid right? Don't turn me in. Are you my friend or not? What are you doing here? Nothing special. Just playing. Great place to play, right next to the railroad. Our vegetable allotments are here. Do you live in this barrack? I'm coming, mama. - What are you shaking for, boy? - You really scared us. - Did you see the wreck? - No, we were at the market. Let's go. If mum sees me now she'll let me have it. Don't worry. It'll pass. Only not a word to anybody. Swear to God. Here, kiss it. Galia, look. - What's that? - A picture. That's a girl. - Who did it to her, the Japs? - Ours. - What are you talking about? - I swear it. I snatched it from the red-face. Are you trying to scare me? He carries out orders in the prison. Look at this. First a shot in the temple then in the back of the head. You know what the second one's for? Control bullet. They're strict there. They take a picture of each shot. How do you know all that? My mom's boyfriend told her when he was drunk one night, they thought I was asleep and I was listening. - What if he finds out? - He won't. He's got a big stack of these pictures in his pocket. Throw it away or burn it. Why? It's horrible. That's what they'll do to me. What's going to happen? First my mother will turn me in. She'll start howling and take me off to confess. Then they'll tighten the screws and I'm done for. Your mother loves and pities you. Don't talk bad about her. Pities me? She pitied me once and she'll pity me a second time. What hurts most is she'll believe anybody but me. - What are you going to do? - Take off somewhere. - Whereto? - I'll go to a factory school. If only I had some ink, but I don't wanna draw on my skin. There was some case... Once they took a guy out to be shot. They stood him against the wall and aimed. He tore open his shirt, and there was Stalin on his chest. They made him turn around, and he had Lenin on his back. And that was it. They didn't shoot him. Let's go to my place, we'll think of something. I can't go back to the barrack. You don't have to leave. Damn, it went out. Galia, come home. Devil. The man in the hat asked about the wreck. I didn't tell him. What man in a hat? Little girl. Don't come near me. Stop that. Be quiet. Why are you bothering the children? Wait. Take me with you. I beg you, help me, give me your hand. What are you looking at, stinker? Help me get on. Please help me climb on, take me with you. What, is it hard for you? Give me your hand, I have to get out. Please! Help me at least a little. What are you looking at? Gregory, let the dogs loose! What if he falls under the wheels? Gregory, let the dogs loose I said! I don't want to end up in jail because of that bitch. No, don't! Get away! Cowardly nut - couldn't even bite the goner. He's still young, he'll learn. Bite her! Bite! Thieving mug... Who are you running from? It's me, Nina's son from Suchan. Did you recognize me? Can I stay a couple of days? - You could have let us know. They're crawling out of the dark corners around here. - How are things at home? - About the same. - Your mum's not married yet? - No, not yet. I took him on as a lodger and we got married. - You want something to eat? - A little. My old man works as a night watchman. I take the leftovers from there and feed my pig. - We have a pig too. - They're only trouble. You're tired, honey. Do you want some tea? I'm going to bed. Lay down, I'll undress you. I'll make it warm for you, honey. Can I sleep in your attic? Don't smoke there. You'll burn the house down! I don't smoke. I've no matches. - You got an extra blanket? - There's enough rags there. - Will you sleep late? - No. Tomorrow we have the day off. We'll sleep late. I won't bother you. Well, lock it up, I'm gone. The wayside winding and golden Oh you, dear youthful joy, impossible LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT VLADIVOSTOK STATION Oh, we sing stronger, become closer LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT VLADIVOSTOK STATION LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT VLADIVOSTOK STATION Hey girlfriend, come out and look at your boyfriend LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT VLADIVOSTOK STATION Oh youthful joy, impossible Your legs just yearn to dance Do you have a father? I'll be your father. Black clouds fly, the air smells of noodles Neighbors fight at dinner, as the cook runs with a poker When we beat the enemy on the Volga And we asked him: You must be from the Volga? But the boy simply replied: I'm from the Far East, from the city of Suchan - Vasiliev? - Yes. - From Suchan? - Yes. Come on out. - Who's that? - A cop. I'm not here. Halt! Go on. Keep this kid for me till tonight. I know that you have a building to repair. Only until the evening. I'll send him to Suchan tonight, O.K.? - Where should I put him? - How'd you get dirty? The little scum scared me. Be a little less rough with your hands, got it? Take him to the jail. Can Ivanov take him? And I have to clean my uniform. Tell Ivanov I gave my permission. Oh tobacco, cigarettes We became friends you and I We've gotten old, girl But we're still fighting strong - Give us a smoke, boss! - Shut up, silly bitch. Where's Ivanov? Hello. Hi kid. Who you looking for? - Bled. - Who's that? I don't know. The lame one told me to say that. What else did he say? He said you'd understand. Who you trying to fool? Nobody. The cops got me. Who let you out for a walk? I just took off and came to you. - What for, pigeons? - No. What are you staring at? You recognize me? No, just looking. - You like it? - I've never had a pigeon. I'd tear anybody's head off for this pigeon. Give him to me! Might be the end of our pigeon loft. He'll confess to me. - Leave off, Taras. He doesn't know anything. - Want some grub? - Yeah. How'd you get in here? I could shoot you. This is a jewelry store. Come on out. Come out I said. Get out. Valerka, stand guard. Maybe the kid's just blabbing. It's heroism for him, but for us it's curtains. A stool pigeon has to know his place. No reason for him to know our secrets. We took the punk in. - You mean what you say? - Yeah. Carried out as ordered, captain. Put her there. - Who's that? - Why, it's Galia! Galia! - Here comes the tail. How did she know where to find you? She's a die-hard detective. She'll find you anywhere. My skates were stolen and she found them. - Why doesn't she come to us? - She's a weird one. And we're here wondering who's ratting on us. Yeah, time to hit the road. Don't worry, Taras. We'll take them for a ride on the island. I do so love it. We'll get all dirty. When we're done, into the water, and get all clean. - What do you say, Bled? - Do what you want. Where did you come from? Your mom's looking for you. Why'd you run from the police? How'd you know? You were at my grandmother's? Pretty shrewd of you. - You with my mother? - Alone. I was at my aunt's. So my mom called the police? You thought because of the wreck? They're rebuilding it. So you can trip on home without worry. - Who's that? - My friends. What are you so angry about? Come on, have something to eat. - No, and I advise you not to. - Come on, don't be difficult. Don't you understand? Leave me alone. Die alone if you want. Get off me. Don't touch her. I'll take care of it. We have to get the girl back or she'll think badly of us. Shouldn't have let her go. Let's get her. - He's got a knife. - Come on, faster. Run! Faster! Follow me! Valera, wait. I gotta talk to you. A fast train rushes from Penza to Moscow I lie on the top bunk and pretend I'm sleeping This was a great idea. They'd have caught us long ago. In the darkness I notice someone's suitcase I open it and see a knife and a gun - Valerka. - What? What? - Be honest with me. If I hadn't come would you have come home? Sure I would have. I wanted to come home the whole time. But they tricked me from the start. - Did you steal? - Who, me? Yes, I did. Once Bled stuck me through a window. Bled? Yeah, it stands for: "Bad Luck Every Day". Stupid nickname. Ah to hell with him. I don't even want to hear about him. - Have you finished with them? - Sure. - Swear. - Here, hold it. Give me your paw. Aw. You fool. Why so hard? And if I do the same? I'm sorry. I just really meant it from the heart. Get away from me. Enough messing around kids. The train stops here. You can walk along the tracks. It's not far to Suchan. It's nice here in the taiga. - Better than in Vladivostok? - You bet. - You figured that out, huh? - Yeah. Out of the way, you fool!
