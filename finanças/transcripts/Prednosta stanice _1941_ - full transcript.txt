Seven thirty, the train is late again. You say it like it's my fault. - I don't run the trains. - I know. You're my sweet Anatol. Now kiss me goodbye and be careful, don't get run over, I'll be back in the afternoon. I'll miss you, Julinka. - Good morning, madam. - Good morning. Pivoda! Where's Mrs Master going? For a new hat, mister landowner. - It's spring. - Yes, it's spring. Thank you. That's enough. But this is not enough. What can I do. - Hey, Karel, let's go. - Right now, mister landowner? Yes, right now. Madam also wants to the city. She told me to be ready at 8. Listen, Karel, don't talk back. - I said to go, so we go. - As you wish. Pepička. Pepička! Yes, mister chief. Why are you crying? Two days here and already lonely? Ah no, I cut the onion. - What's with the tables? - Tables are here. - I see, but what's missing? - Flies. Pepička, am I stupid, or are you? I don't know. You decide, chief. I'm asking you, what's missing? - Guests, please. - Sure, they will come when you didn't even do the tables. - What are you waiting for? - For when my chief tells me. You said yesterday to do only when you say so. Sure, I'd have to wait for you to have idea. That'd work out! Now do the tables. They recommended me this good for nothing as the smartest of a village. Tablecloths are spotless. Of course, they are, nothing is being served. - Not a soul for lunch. - That's not my fault. You didn't attract a single guest. I won't attract anyone, I have a boyfriend and I'm faithful. Pepička, you do this. Stand next to the door, when someone walks by, give him this leaflet. Understood? - Hmm. - Come here. You keep telling people, that we have the tastiest meals. But mister chief, that's not true. We'd be full otherwise. My God. I'm going, or something bad happens. Sir, there you go, it's free. Mistress, there you go, it's free. It's almost lunchtime and you have them all. How all? I gave many away. You have to go outside, so people see you. - Sir, there you go, it's free. - Free? All right. - What are you doing? - Nothing, mister inspector. As I look at you, it looks as if we have the same ones, right? You on the walk... I'm on duty. I'm on business trip. But the difference is, that you get paid, I'm paying myself. One pocket to another. Since childhood. - Parents didn't support you? - No, I'm a love child. What a smell, isn't it? Is that you? No. Could be rabbit on pepper. Look out, guest. Would you like a lunch? I would like. Lunch too. The well-known Hejhal restaurtant. Yes, known, excellent restaurant. Yes. I've read your ad. Seeking violinist. How is it? Is there salary, or to collect money, or for food? - You're violinist? - I'm coming to say, that I can't accept the position, I can't play at all. But you can have a lunch. Well yes, but I'm invited, you know? Come. Come for lunch. That's for free. - This? - Yes, advertisement. You think I could advertisely eat? Sure, chief will be happy I brought someone. Come, you'll be welcome. And miss, is it all ready? - Yes. - To not wait. Creamy hare… Creamy hare, hmm. - Is it really hare? - Yes. - Do you have cats? - Not since yesterday. Then no hare for me, I could walk on ledge home. - Lungs on fine… - On wine. Wine, yes, yes. Baked mutton. Who mutted it? - Mister chief. - Aha. Veal breast with stuffing, beef with side dish, sausage… Wait, I see something. Fried veal legs. Didn't have these for ages. I'll have that. - Sir chose? - Sir won't be choosing, give me all top to bottom. Everything. Sir will eat here outside, or inside? Outside, I'm used to it from home. So, soup, starter and hare on cream. Pork, dumplings, cabbage. Fried veal legs... Halt, veal legs twice. One should eat those limbs, he needs the most. And that's my case. Dessert, cheese, black coffee. - No beer, sir is abstainer. - No beer, sir is abstainer. - That, good. - Yes. And, miss, how is it with paying? Right now, or after? - There's enough time. - Enough. And how's your chief? Can he run? Oh no. He's chubby. Ah, so, leave it here. And, miss, what's side dish to the legs? Potato salad or spinach. Oh. Could I get something else? - Sure. - Right, so, instead of salad give me let's say goose, and something lighter instead of spinach. Maybe roast. - Sure. - Yeah. What's for dessert? Apples in blanket. - What? - Apples in blanket. - In blanket? - Yes. But... In blanket... In the cloth? - How is it? - In blanket, that's... Wait, just give them naked, okay? - Alright. - Yes. - This one's beautiful. - Take it, it suits you. - Isn't it too expensive? - Three hundred crowns. I don't know, what will husband say. Ah madam, that's not your husband's business. - If you allow... - Mister landowner... Mister landowner means selflessly, friendly. - A tribute to your beauty. - No, I buy my stuff. - You won't be offended... - Sure not, madam. You know well, I'm a shadow of your beauty. - The hat is amazing. - Put the old one in the box. - I'll carry it. - But I go straight to train station. So do I. I have some packages. - You don't take them by car. - Only train. Out of sympathy. Thank you. - Sir enjoyed? - Oh yes. - I'm stuffed. - Will you recommend us? Of course, I will. Pepička, come here. Be careful, so no one leaves without paying. I wouldn't want to run after someone. It happened once, one ran without paying. And I had to pay his hospital for three weeks, you know, Pepička? Look, guests are coming. Go serve. Don't forget paying. I'll want money ahead, chief. - I can't miss my train. - But madam, there's so many other trains. - What would you like? - Coffee for madam - and soda for me, okay? - Sure, sir. Are you absolutely sure, that you have money? Excuse me, what's that? If you didn't have for spending, I'd have trouble with chief. That's cute. There, I pay ahead. That will be safer. The service here isn't the nicest. Your wife is not here today? I see you rarely alone, she's usually with you. I haven't noticed. I wouldn't want madam Olga to be suspicious, there's no reason. After all, even my husband could suspect me. You go so often to station. Without a reason. You know, madam, I took care of reasons. Or better, packages. Sir is satisfied with our cuisine? If sir's satisfied, he'll surely recommend us - to friends and relatives? - Of course. - You have many friends? - They're chasing me. Also connection in higher places. That's important for promotion. That's right. All I do is promote. - How come? - I walk with ads. You? You walk with ads? You carry ads? - Black coffee. - For me. - Wait! Take away the coffee and bring a bill to the fine guest. And dessert, I didn't have dessert. - What dessert. - And lungs with dumpling. No lungs! No dumpling! There'll be trouble. - Mister restaurateur... - Yeah? What do you with a person, that eats here, drinks, and says, he forgot wallet home? We send someone for the wallet! Hmm. And if there's none? That can't happen to honest person, that's a fraud. But if that happens anyway? What do you do then? Then I catch that guy, slap him until he passes out, wake him up, kick him, so he flies on the road. But can't guarantee, he'll ever walk again. You'd be able to? Such strong person? You couldn't handle it differently? - How? - Well, how. Take me to the side and say "don't do it again"! "Careful next time." Give me some money and I go. - Do I steal? - I don't know. - I'll go for officer. - Oh wait... Look at me. Have mercy, I look like a shadow. How about me? So do you. But of a circus. - I'll go for officer. - Come on... We do it like this. I sit here, you keep bringing food, I keep eating and doing you advertisement. No way, you dog. No. Let's do something else. Do you have something expensive? - Yes, I do. Teeth. - Listen... Then just fire me and done. - You’re not my employee. - That won't work either, will it. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? One works hard since morning and you say "go"! There's door! No manners? That's normal? Look at this, you will slap me in the end! - Good idea. - Pepička, go for officer. - What's happening? - They're calling police. Let's leave. I don't like these things. Yes, that's very unpleasant. - What's with you? - Ah nothing, nothing. - But my woman, sorry... - But... So here was husband's business meeting. Mister taverner, guests are leaving, I'll bring them back. Don't move! You'll stay here, rascal. - What did you call me. - Don't move, or... People will get used to not pay, you'll see. Excuse me, was here older gentleman with a young lady? That's the one that ran away. - Ran and didn't pay! - I'll be happy to pay. - All? - For what I care. And for me. And for me. Start and go. We leave madam here? - I said go! - Arnošt… - Dear, I finally found you. - Where were you, Arnošt? I ran some errands, until stores close. Ah, you bought me a hat? - Seems like that. - Not a bad choice. Not bad, right? - Franta… - Yeah? So the old crate will ride again. Interesting, Inspector General always wants, - a sleeping wagon. - What's so weird? He sleeps after lunch. Let's go. - Where are you going? - To dress madam. Ah. Go, go. - What is that? - Red grapes juice. Madam is starting again her grape diet. - Would you like? - No, thanks a lot. Enough that she starves me now. But mister landowner, your menu stays the same. Your favourite wine will be on the table. Good that you reminded me. Tell madam, when she asks, that I went to train station, - to pick up my wine package. - Again new wine? But mister landowner, we have full wine cellar. What is it to you? When it comes, you put it to cellar. But if it's in the afternoon, then no. Evening also not, I'm free. Yes, free from me. Question is if madam will let you. I won't be held back! If she won't, I'll run away! - Right. - Růženka! So run, but upstairs. Růženka! Růženka, I had half kilo less yesterday! Ten kilos must go. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, nothing but grape juice. Fifty. What's inside? That's some weight. Head of the inventor Morávka, it's to be unveiled tomorrow. That's why it's such hurry. They sent it last moment. You have a lot to do, you can't unveil without a head. Rehearsal in chief's office. ♫ And then the old wanderer♫ ♫ played violin. ♫ ♫ Songs about love, ♫ ♫ he never cried. ♫ ♫ When I'll be old ♫ ♫ and remembering, ♫ ♫ I want to be happy ♫ ♫ and laugh like him. ♫ ♫ When the old wanderer♫ ♫ plays violin under the window. ♫ What's the next station, mister conductor? Mokrá nad Soupravou, General Inspector. Mokrá. That's a boring place. - Last year we didn't stop. - No, mister General Inspector. We have to stop by this year. Who's the stationmaster? Anatol Jelen. He was promoted recently. Born 1899, married, child free. 16.2. requested to be transferred closer to capital city. Pivoda, come here. Do your stuff in the morning, deposit incoming packages, - in the afternoon you take my job. - Me as a stationmaster? Nothing can happen, nobody comes here, - only for tickets. - But I'm free in afternoon. - I'm meeting my fiancé. - Well, you're not. Get married and you won't have to meet. I'll do it the day I get a raise... Man, you want a raise? I hope, you'll support me, stationmaster, - since I step in for you. - You can hope, but now go work. Nothing can happen, I'll be right back, we just rehearse for tomorrow. - There'll be banquet, right? - But you won't be there. Only the head has to be there. - They took it a while ago. - Just in time. I could do that too. - Hello, warehouseman. - Goo day, mister landlord. - What would you like? - Be that kind, I have three wine boxes here, I'm expecting six watering cans, two fridges, stove and one wing. - Wing? Goose? - Oh no, piano, piano. Ah, some piano came some time back. That was pianino. This is piano. - That's madam? - No, that's stationmaster. Ah, I thought so. You know, I have no musical hearing, I can't tell. Anatol, you know I'm not musical. You have to go, I must practice. - I sing in the evening. - And I have to listen. Dear friend, for your troubles. Be that kind and take one box to the castle today. Just one? There are three. Nevermind, please. Take only one. I'll check the rest, if they sent correct, - that I ordered. - Can't we check it now? No, no, in the evening. Go now. - Good day, madam. - Looking for my husband? - No, for you. - What if husband saw you? Nevermind, I came for my packages. Madam, I'm heated up like a locomotive without a vent. It's up to you if I explode. Please, don't eat my arm. Would you like my arm, mister landowner? Gladly, stationmaster. I came for my packages and saw madam. Now I'm happy to say goodbye. Madam… Pěnkava is not very inconspicuous. If you want to start a fight, don't bother. Do you want to say, you're unhappy here? Not exactly unhappy, but… The only entertaining here is passing train. Be careful, so I don't sit in one eventually. Do you understand? I'd like to push a pram like this. Ideally with a baby inside. You babbler. Only talks, but to get married, no. No? I'm crazy about it. As soon as I get raise, I'll marry. - To me? - To you, Růženka. We start big family, you'll cook for me, I'll always come for lunch and yell: Růženka! Sssh, so madam doesn't hear. Sit down and eat. Hare paté. What a smell. My most favourite food. I got you a nice portion. You get a piece of everything. They're ringing from dining room. Eat, I'll be back. What are you reading, Arnošt? Important stuff. There's a rehearsal of statue unveiling. I have to show off. stationmaster will be there, choir… - What celebration is that? - A little rehearsal. Tomorrow I'll unveil a monument to native in Břízky. I hope you don't want me with you. Oh dear, I wouldn't dare. - But understand, I have to show. - Alright, go show. - We don't have hare paté? - Oh yes. Růženka, how... Is this station restaurant, or what? - A hat. - I see, how did it get here? - You have something with railways! - Me? - They brought wine... - You know? - And the mister from railway... - Just say it, to madam, say it. But carefully. That brought the wine... He leaned forward and it fell. And he left without it? Or sits in kitchen! Let's check! Go after her, go after her! So what do you say? I know, I'm also mad. Don't think about it. Excuse me, sir. This is no public dining room or buffet. Me and Růženka are getting married. When you are, have whatever you want, but there will be no feasts in my castle. The hat belongs on your head, not hare paté. Madam, my head is not that stupid. If you knew, what I know, you'd feed me as a maharaja. You'd bring me yourself the best meals on family silver. What? I'm not interested That's curious, not being interested about your husband. I'm really not curious, only a bit nervous, that hat of yours distracted me. Take it off and make yourself comfortable. Růženka, serve your groom properly, bring from the fridge Pilsner beer. Růža, don't do anything. I'm not eating. I'm a character, madam. Character. You can't buy that with Pilsner. You didn't let me eat, chased me from table and bride. I want noting. I see, you'd like to know, what's landowner doing tonight. But I'm not saying. See you, madam. And when I can't come to you, you will come to me. Even if you'd have to resign. Růženka, you'd like such boor husband? I would, madam, because he's no boor, he's a character. We won't stop in Mokrá, let's continue. But we'll be right there, General Inspector. No. I'm terribly tired. Didn't sleep for a moment. Didn't lay the whole ride. No rest after lunch. That's interesting. As the train goes, it makes you sleep, as a child. As you wish, General Inspector. Was it a busy inspector ride. There are some men. Blind passenger! Who's there? Open! I'm telling you to open! Yeah, yeah, that'd be… - Open up! - Can't you hear! I hear, but I won't open. I'm asking you to open! Open! I'm asking you to open! Open! So you hear or not? Come here. Open this. He jumped out of the window. - Catch him! - It's a blind passenger. - Has no ticket! - Catch him! - Hello. - Hello. - Haven't you seen this person? - Who? Suspicious man, bling passenger. No, I haven't. - You're Mrs. stationmaster. - Yes please. Where's your husband? He has to sign protocol. He left, but he'll be back. What? Isn't he on duty? That's impossible. - That's unfortunate, madam. - Can't you not tell? It's not about me, I'm just a supervisor, but outside is General Inspector, he's extremely strict. - He's suspended many. - That's horrible! If only we managed to find him, all would be good. Let's check staircase, - Maybe he's there. - Please, Mr. supervisor. If you didn't catch me, you won't now. Master, hmm… I could go to the peron. No, no, it's somehow busy. We go this way. Hmm, I guess here they live. Just to not have dog. 'Cause when he doesn't know a person, that's very stupid. Mister stationmaster! Mister stationmaster! - What would you like? - Looking for stationmaster. I'm his wife, how can I help you? Nice to meet you, madam. I'm Kokrhel, General Inspector - of transverse railways. - Nice to meet you. Where's Mr. stationmaster? He had something urgent, committee. But madam, stationmaster on duty can't leave station. They reported something at the eastern traffic light. - That's not far. - I hope so, because longer unjustified absence from service it is simply inexcusable and has bad consequences. Madam, in official matters I'm relentless. - Mr. General Inspector... - Well, madam, the regulations defines for such suspension. He'll be right here. That'll be in his interest. I'd like to meet your husband. You can go. I think he'll be also happy to meet you. Yes. We didn't actually plan to stop here. You didn't leave yet? But now I see that inspection is very needed. He'll be right here, I'll send for him. Nice station. Sending for stationmaster as for a beer. People like at fair, I don't know where to run. Mister Pivoda, mister Pivoda! So I finally found you. Come here, mister stationmaster. Come, come in. I'm scared to look back. You're not away? How can I be away, when I'm here. Your wife is looking for you. My wife? First time I hear that. Yes, your wife. You're stationmaster, aren't you? - In here? - Of course. - Of course. Well excuse me. What are you doing? You don't know you should press that? - How would I not know? - Why don't you do it? You'd have to let me! Well. Hey, put the barriers down and up again. Good. Well. Hey, did the local train go? Not yet. Ring me then. Good. Well, I know to press it. And what are you doing in my office? Well excuse me, I'm doing an inspection. - Seeking a blind passenger. Where's he? - I don't know. But you have to solve it. It's serious matter. I don't have time, I expect train from Kolín, I'm busy. Mr. stationmaster, you don't know who you speak to. Tell me, if it surprises me. I'm Kokrhel. Ha, my granny used to wear you on her head. Excuse me, I'm general inspector of transverse railways. Interesting. Let's make tea then. But I'm your boss, Kokrhel. You should've messaged. We could prepare welcome parade. I don't appreciate this tone, okay? - Alright. - Where are we? Guess. - You have to find out. - I'm supposed to guess? Tell me now, where are we. - Well, on train station. - I know, but which one? Which one. It's written there. Buffet! I ask you one last time to speak to me politely. I'm working here and you're acting like a mad man. - Didn't you drink? - But I'm an abstainer! Abstainer. This person is peculiar. This is Mokrá. (=wet) Must be, otherwise it wouldn't print. - Mokrá, I say! - I'm saying, Mokrá! Why didn't you say, when I asked you. In Mokrá the stationmaster is Jelen. Are you? If there's stationmaster Jelen, I must be Jelen. You wanted transfer closer to the city, right? Well, if it could… If it could! For such position you must have the best qualifications, and you? I don't understand you. Maybe, maybe I could find it. Hm, find it. Qualification. You're married. - Yes, yes. - I talked to your wife. Do you have kids? I'm asking you if you have kids? - I don't, no. - No kids, well. Wait, since I'm here, I'll try your qualification. So you asked for transfer. What month was that? Could you tell me? Well there you go. - So, in which one? - That was the, how it's called... Wait, you don't know, now I see, you don't know. I'm wasting my time like this. Jelen. Well, sixteenth of second. - First. - Second. - First. - Second. - First. - What's with the first? I thought we're counting march. Counting! Here you sent your request. - Well, February. - Second. Excellent. Wait, to finish this. You call the controller, understood, and we investigate the fraud. - What fraud? - The rascal, who travels for free. And in special wagon. He escaped here and we're chasing him. What did he do? He went without ticket, is that not enough? And you have a ticket? That's not the same, I'm an official. The more you should have one. You sit one someone's place, who'd like to pay. - You should sit on locomotive. - How do you speak to me? You'd also like, that he pulled emergency brake! And what should he pull on a train? Maybe he knew about accident. Perhaps collapsed railway, torn tracks. Jammed tunnel. That's just a speculation. Move on. - Move where? - I said move on. - I'm here officially. - Ah well. Maybe he didn't want free ride. Poor guy was there sleeping, you suddenly take the wagon and ride away. Can't you tell him a day ahead? Look, mister stationmaster, you made up a romantic story, honour to your imagination, but bad to your official manners. Bad! Mister Pivoda! - Play, mister landowner. - Isn't someone calling. Who'd call. Be glad we're alone and can play. But I wanted to play only five games. You were supposed to let me win. - According to what? - All the rules, when rich plays with poor, he lets poor win. - And I'm in with twenty crowns. - Alright, let's play. Nothing happening? Oh no. Good, that you came! Right on time! Sir, who are you? I'm the stationmaster here. - That's my husband. - Well, yeah. Sir, where did you get the uniform? Madam, I wore it to save your husband. You're saving nobody, take it off! Madam let's not do it. We'll get into trouble. So we won't get the rascal, huh? - General inspector. Silence. - We're going in two minutes. In two minutes? Alright, I'll spoke a bit - with mister stationmaster. - Sure. They leave in two minutes, we can do it. Don't tell on us. Well, madam, you found your husband alright? - Ah, yes, sure. - Yes, yes. And where were you? She always wanders, I can't wait for her. Madam, your husband is such strange, stubborn person. We can't all be the same. He has something in him unruly. I have to say, I wanted to make such notes in his revision statement. That's the loneliness, it makes one wild. That impression was improved, when I got to know you. - You're truly kind. - Indeed. Mister general, two minutes, we should go. - Did you sign free? - What fine? - Sign? - What for? - Free! - Long time ago. We go in a minute. Go inside and stationmaster will send us away. I'll honk at you. Yes, madam, I do inspections for twenty years. And this is the first time, I'm fully satisfied. But thanks to you. Mister general inspector… Madam, don't you get bored here? - Not really, right? - Talking to your wife, colleague. - Are you well-furnished here? - Very humble. But if mister general would like small refreshment, I'd dare. Not a bad idea, to swallow some. Madam, I'd dare. Mister colleague, I accept your invitation. Give me keys from pantry. What's that? I don't know. Earlier too, there in the corner. But that's a train. I know, I didn't want in front of her. Ah. Madam, your husband is hopeless. Well, mister stationmaster, go to peron, duty is duty. - Please, mister general. - Happy to, madam, just a moment. Go to peron! - Didn't a train come? - No, that's just a local one. - Shouldn't you go? - As it came, it'll leave. - I can't let go, when losing. - Okay, but I'd… Sit down, Mr. landowner. And play. I have to put ten… Acorns and acorns and finish. - Right. You play well. - Good, but I'm losing. What? Yes, some train came. It's gone. I don't know number. You'll know when it comes. Well of course. Some knocking all the time. Why is my window a drum? What do you want? What time goes train to Svijany - Podolí? 8:64. - I'm sorry? - 64. If you don't have time, leave an address, and we message you, as something goes. Don't you have timetable? We do, but you wouldn't understand it. Wait a moment. - What time? Morning? - Yes. Morning nothing. You'd have to go in afternoon. Afternoon then. Afternoon goes, but from New Year. And only in clear weather. As I look at you, - I think, I know you. - Me? I was in Hejhal restaurant. Remember? Where you ate so cheaply. Ah, this… I'd need it again. Now when you're stationmaster? Such a nice position. But without food. I'm so hungry I'd bite bumpers. Still it's better than handing out leaflets. No difference, leaflets, or tickets. How did you get the position? Well, it's not in newspapers, you have to send a request, stamp it, wait... That'd the official process, you wait some years… When it's your turn, they hire some friend. Give me then the ticket to Svijany - Podolí. I told you, nothing goes. I just came from there. That was last one, we cancelled them. You want only cars, buses, now you'd like train? We're waiting for your few cents. We're losing enough without them. I prepared money for ticket and everything… - You have money? - Sure. I thought you go on ID. That's different, I'll give you special train with dancing wagon. Or wait, don't you want to go by the one on peron? - If it goes to us. - That one goes everywhere, - it's a tour. - Then give me ticket. - What class do you go? - Third. - I'll give you first. - Isn't that more expensive? It doesn't matter. Railways like to give away, we're glad, when we drive someone. But you have to recommend us. - There. Thank you. - Thanks a lot. The ticket says Scotland. - Then you go to Scotland. - What would I do there, I don't speak Scottish. - Well what can I do? - Change it. If only you could read. It doesn't say Scotland, it says skates. That means you get skate with each ticket. I'll have to give you one more, you can't skate on just one. Well… I gave you two ten crowns, give me change. Railways don't give change, we'd earn nothing. Mister stationmaster. Twenty crowns in a minute, that's business. Keep knocking. Leave us alone. Hey, sir, can't you hear? Someone's knocking. - I sent her away. - We don't send anyone away. - Mister stationmaster... - Well. Woman, what do you want? This is like a post. When it says Closed, we're closed. We're having conversation. No way, colleague, first serve customer. This is no customer, this is a woman. The more you should be kind. Open up. - What do you want? - I have luggage, write it down. - I don't accept luggage - Since when? Since yesterday afternoon. I voted for it. Jokes aside, accept that luggage. Give it here. Don't you see the window is too small? Why do you force it? - Well did I do it? - Well, did. You accept luggage here, in the office? - And where? - In waiting room. There's a big scale behind the corner. But where's the waiting room? You're looking at it. The scale too. - Stationmaster asks for waiting room! - I know! - Is there scale? - Yes. - Put it on it. Let's go. Go. What go? Where do I go? On a scale too? - I have tickets, don't I? - And I need one? It's not about you... There's the scale. - It's a bit heavy. - How heavy? About thirty kilos. Thirty-five and sixty eight decagrams. Stop guessing and put it on scale. It is. - Here's scale. - And there. You have to put it. - Put it there. - Put it there. And now we weigh it. How much? Hundred ten. That's too heavy. You know I hate such jokes! What's that? I don't know. What's that? If something expensive, you have to tax it. - Get off the scale. - Mister general inspector. - Mister general inspector, please. - At your service, madam. I prepared upstairs aperitive. May I ask you? Ah sure. I'm coming. I have no more money, I'm going. You had only fifty, mister landowner? - Yes. You wouldn't have played? - I wouldn't have played. See. My woman took my cheque book, - to not spend much. - Landowner and fifty crowns! - Please. Tell my wife. - Why would I tell her. You have box of wines, give me some. Yes, right. Still, I'd prefer… Sit down, landowner. I'll tell you when it's time. - Alright then. - I have bank. - Yes. What's in there? - Two bottles of Riesling. Two bottles of Riesling. Give me card, okay? Yes. One more. Allow me to look, okay? And you drink. Stop asking, go there and done. Our general is there. He must be mad, he won't show up and will sleep. Well, that's the thing. And we'll wait. Trains will avoid this station through fields. What's this? Some oilcans or… No, that's a trumpet. Oh yey… What's that? I missed my train! - Me too. - How did that happen? How did that happen... I'm standing here, right? And now, I don't know why, I tooted on this. And without asking, he goes. Excuse me, that's horrible. That's a catastrophe. I'll have to stay overnight. Me too. I mean, that's the usual. Yeah, with you. But what do we do? What about that. We'll play mariáš… - Wait, no mariáš. - No mariáš, I know. No. - Darda is better. - But darda! No way! - Colleague, you know what? - No. - We'll make a revision. - That's awesome. Or you know what? We make dumplings with eggs. Wait, no dumplings, we make official revision, - you don't understand. - Ah, revision. - Yes, revision. - Why not. Prepare your stuff, we search through the building and you'll see, how the time flies. Could mister inspector come up? Here it's no cosy. With pleasure, madam. So, colleague, prepare the things. And inventory. - Yes. - Please. Well, inventory. If I knew, where it is. To prepare it, hm. So you don't say, mister landowner, that someone took it. You lost twelve bottles of wine and two of cognac. That doesn't matter. Just tell me, - if stationmaster is away. - He can return any time. This side entrance and home. That's the safest. Well, I'll look around. I assure you, madam, that I'll never forget the lovely times spent in Mokrá nad Soupravou. Now allow me, I must check downstairs, what's stationmaster doing. But, don't leave yet… But madam, I'd rather not left at all. I have to, I have to go check. - But just for a bit. - Yes, yes, madam. Just for a bit. Sixty-seven, sixty-eight, sixty-nine, sixty ten. Sixty ten. Ew! To hell with this inventory. - What is that, colleague? - I'm doing inventory. Inventory? You call this inventory? You're crazy! - Not yet, but soon. - You did this? But it was your idea. You said to do inventory. My idea. Aha. Listen, colleague, aren't you a bit overworked? - I mean, a bit nervous. - Yes, yes. I mean… Didn't you suffer an accident, or so, that you feel… Not really. Well once I walked on stilts and fell over. You went as a stationmaster on stilts?! It's a hobby of mine. - I use it in city, sometimes. - Ah, well. Even in the city. Now I get it, colleague. Now it's all clear to me. I know. Yes, yes, yes. But this can't be, colleague. You can't endanger the station! You have to leave! - If I was gone, it's too late. - Yes. Rely on me. Your transfer will be approved. That's for sure. For now you get sick leave, you'll go out, relax… And I'll take care of madam. That's really nice of you, mister general Kokrhel. Not you too! I beg you, leave! Leave! You're sending me away? Do you know, how I suffered behind those doors, hearing our sweet voice and my rival? If you knew, what situation I'm in. Imagine, the highest supervisor and husband is somewhere singing. - Poor me. - Singing, singing… What was that? - He's coming back. - I knew it! I knew it! - Leave! - Where? There! Don't come until I call you. Please. - You yell "now"? - Yes. - Okay. Venda, I brought food, you're surely hungry. You're reading my mind, dear girl. All you couldn't eat in the afternoon… - He's here. - Yes. - Then come. You know, colleague, it's past seven? - Time flies, or? - I'm so hungry, - I'd eat nails. - Me too. Someone put sugar on watering can, I'd eat it all. I believe you. - When do you usually eat dinner? - That's not always the same. I know. As duty allows you. I understand. Not really. Depends, how's the treasury. - How should I understand that? - Depends on my income. Ah, when you think, you didn't earn for the company, - you're fasting. - Yes, like that. - That's a bit extreme. - True. How about today? Are you fasting? - It seems like it - Oh no, colleague, I'm telling you, I'd like to ask your wife, to make me dinner. - Not a bad idea. - What? You could also mention me, hm? That's funny. Aren't you invited every day? Having food with such a lovely lady… Must be charming. Right? You... You like her? I'd lie if I said no. - She's very adorable. - Oh yes, very. - What if madam finds us? - No worries. She's busy with mister Pěnkava. She'll try to get rid of him, but he won't leave. He's so in love. Good idea, to take it with me. I'll serve it then. That's right. That must be. Damn it, this needs something to drink. I took glasses, but forgot about it. Don't worry. You'll see what I have. I won from Pěnkava few bottles. There. Listen, someone's in waiting room. Don't you think? - Next door, right? - Someone knocked…? - So-something next door? - Yes. - Go take a look then! - Ah yes, well... It's here! - It's here! - What? - Dinner. - Oh no… Dinner, that's great. From madam? - From madam. - But that's great. So she didn't forget. - This? - All this. Come, have it, colleague, come. - Come. I put it here? - On the table. What did madam prepare… Oh wonderful, chickens! And strudel. Hmm, that's wonderful. Such dinner and… Why do you eat in office? There's no comfort here. - She has these ideas... - Yes? Once I dine in warehouse, once on barrels. Once I ate in Chlumec nad Cidlinou. We could put tablecloth? Why not tablecloth… Here… Is some towel. - If it's clean… - Clean as bean. Let's put... like this. You know, colleague… That's very imaginative? It feels like the fairy-tale "Table, serve us". I hope the baton won't come. - Did you call, madam? - No. - You didn't say "yes"? - No, please, stay! I'll go down, to see, if it's free, I'll give you a sign and you have to run. Understood? Understood, madam, but… Dinner for my rival. No, I don't understand! Mister inspector, I hope you'll accept small dinner. You're very kind. We already found your food. - This? - This. Very nice joke, madam. - Who brought it here? - Saint Nicholas. Please, sit down. Please, please! There sits miser inspector! - I sit here. Where do I sit? - Well here. Sure, I did my job, so I can go sit away. May I? You're lady, you have to get first. Help yourself, mister inspector. - No, madam, you first. - You're our guest. I can't eat, if there's nothing for you. - You really won't? - I can't. No? I'll have it then. What vagabond is this? I'm sorry? She said we have a bond. Gosh, Venda! - Dinner is gone! - What are you doing here? Ah, mister landowner. Yes, mister landowner. But quiet, please, okay? - What are you doing here? - What is it to you? Be gone, I don't need you here! That's just awful. Not a second without manors. I've never seen this. Again someone there. What a nuisance when we dine. Someone wants to ride on Sunday and comes for tickets on Wednesday. Drinks for mister inspector. Wonderful! Bravo! Nicely chilled. I thought it was forgotten. No way, madam didn't forget. - Yes. - Corkscrew. I'd take my glass… No, colleague, to open the bottle. - Ah yes. - Corkscrew, yes? Splendid. That's an excellent brand, madam. No wonder you hurry to open it. - I'm abstainer. - But you'll have with me? Madam, will you tell him? He'll listen to you. Happy to. But you take care of me, dear. Why was landowner in waiting room? I think he ate our dinner. It's gone. That's nice! No dinner, but Pěnkava here. If he ate it, he'll get it from me! - Venda, calm down! - Let go! Cheers, mister inspector... - Cheers madam. - Cheers.

Dear Jelen, that's an excellent brand. - But this is not... - Be silent, please. - This is your warehouseman? - Yes, mister inspector. - Our warehouseman Pivoda is treasure. - Happy to help, mister inspector. You can help now. - Sure, mister inspector. - Unscrew this. You have unique taste, madam! - Someone knocking? - Yes, I see. I know, what it is. - I'll take care of it. - Go. - What are you doing? - Go, you can't be here! General inspector. Revision. Promotion.

I see, everything is alright here. I like an order, mister general inspector. Yes. You know, madam, I feel sorry for you, seeing you living here. You complained? I hope not. That's interesting. She wouldn't kiss me with a witness. Don't be shy because of me. Madam, as I see you, so seductively restrained to your husband, I'd say you met today. See, that's proper inspection. Give him kiss too. Excuse me, mister inspector, I'll clean your room. I'm ashamed I'm giving you work. It's an honour to care for you. - Beautiful. Charming. - You like her? She's the shining semaphore on this station, - everyone has to stop by. - And stay overnight. I hope the stay doesn't bother you. - What's this? - Oh my. - Something rang. - Of course it rang. It's a telegram, isn't it? - Telegram is calling. - Now, in the evening. Of course. Well, there. - Oh no. - What? - Who put this here? - Dear God… - Look, how it jumps. - I can see that. You've never seen a telegram? Well, there. - There it comes. - Accept the telegram. - What? - Accept the telegram. - I accept. - Come on, colleague... You are... Wait… I have to admit, I'm not used to Morse anymore. - There you go. - You don't know it? - I do, but I forgot. - What is this. You have to know. No jokes, colleague. Dot, dash, dot, dot, dot, dash, dash Stop it, colleague. Now seriously. What are they saying? Apparently, cargo, isn't it? Yes, here. Careful, cargo. So? Further, which one? The train is too long, you think it ends and... You won't count wagons. What train is it? - I got it. - Thank God, so? Dear Karlíček. I'm sending you twenty-six wild boars, two boars and one domestic pig. - Ah, I get... - Your Vašíček. I understand, colleague. I know. But now, at night? Really? - You're still wondering. - What wondering. Answer. - Answer the telegram. - I know. Go on… - About the train… - Colleague, answer! - No. No, no. - Why? - No. I don't talk to him. - To whom? - The one that called. - What does it mean? It's your duty! You have to, sir! - I'm not answering, no. - Why? - Why... He sent me once, Wednesday afternoon, a locomotive coal ahead. You don't do that! Look, colleague, quit joking around, sit down and answer. Don't be... Well. Dear Julie, I'm ruined by your relentlessness. God, what have I done to deserve this. Go! Some guy is here for you. Two. I'm telling your man. - Please. - I'm telling him. - Do! - I will! But how? What's this again? He got the message and is glad, that we're friends again. Your room is ready. Much obliged, madam. You're very kind. Right after you. Sir! Do you know what's happening? I don't. With whom I have the honour? - Who am I? - That's stationmaster Jelen. - Who said that? - Mister general inspector. - What? - He approved it as a - highest instance, so it's true. - Then it's true. I don't recognise mister Jelen. But I recognise you. You eat and don't pay. How dare you? I'll tell your wife and she'll show you! - I must be hallucinating. - What's this? Go away! I'm sure you're tired, need some rest, mister inspector. - Not really. - I'll call him. No, no, let him work. He works all day, until the night. The better. He'll sleep like a log. He needs it. Thinking about your husband. He's overworked. He needs quieter, but better position. I'd like to get him promoted and relocate him to better place. You deserve it. - Mister inspector... - You don't have to respond. - Dear madam... - Julie! Who's this! You'll find out, sir. I’m Jelen. You're relative of mister stationmaster. Yes, relative, mister general inspector. General inspector! Aren't you ashamed? For what, mister? I'm your boss. You're rude intruder, sir! - How did you get to my flat? - Please shut up. You're not ashamed, bringing guys here when I'm away? - I'm general inspector! - I don't care! There! You don't care. I'm here officially, I'm doing a revision. I'll revise this, you've never seen! Excuse me! What special train? I haven't ordered any. - Done. - Pivoda! Pivoda, come here, lock the doors. - It'll be interesting. - It'll be, sir! Call everyone from building here! There’ll be investigation. Strict investigation, sir. Go, if general inspector wishes to. - At your service, general inspector. - Quiet! Now I speak! - For a long time! - I meant, just... Mister general inspector, I beg you pardon... Tell me, sir… Stationmaster Jelen... Jelen who? Jelen me? Jelen him! So you say, you're stationmaster Jelen. He is. He looks shocked. Sir, I forbid you such tone! I'm the master of this station. And I forbid... - You! - Yes. - Based on what? - On my strength. You'd like to preach, mister inspector. - And I will. - I don't think you will. You found it here to be alright. You wrote it down, that master is the man, good on duty, should be promoted, relocated to better station… Overall, confirmed his qualification. - That's what you wanted. - No, I wanted... Let me tell you. You wanted to tell master to take better care of his pretty wife, and to not let any hungry dog, walking around here, to circle around her, like a vulture. That's what you wanted to say. You know, stationmaster Jelen, that one wanted to stay overnight? Forgot his official duty and wanted to breathe the same air as madam. Isn't it, mister Kokrhel? - Not quite literally. - Very literally. Train! Again some inspection! Where's madam. Hurry. Mister general inspector, we came back for you. How could you leave without me? I'll remember that! When you need it, you tell him. Mister stationmaster, do the train. You didn't have enough?! Hello, Mokrá nad Soupravou. Jelen. Can special train of mister general inspector go? What's today? Wednesday. He's off. Departure - 20:10. Yes, understood. Thanks. Track is free, mister inspector. Excuse me, madam, that we were sort of… Don't mention it, mister inspector. Ah well. Thank you. Aren't you upset, what have I done here? The opposite. Thank you so much. Say hello to husband. You didn't have enough? To come to peron with me! What did I tell you? Stop following me! Careful! Just wait, when I find out! I see you once again!
