The object is to keep your balls on the table and knock everybody else's off. You're still there, huh? We're gonna do one more song and that's it. All right. And happy Thanksgiving.

Good night. Goodbye. ( "Theme from The Last Waltz") OK, look. We've been together 16 years. - Who? - Who? The Band. - You want me to plug that in? - Let's do it again. The Band has been together 16 years. Together on the road. We did eight years in bars, dives, dance halls. Eight years of concerts and stadiums, arenas. We gave our final concert, The Band's final concert, and we called it The Last Waltz. Why was it held in San Francisco, in Winterland, when you guys have been on the road for 16 years? Winterland was the first place that the band played as The Band. Some friends showed up and helped us take it home. Not just friends. They're more than that. Would you ask me that again? They weren't just friends. They weren't just friends who came in to say hello. You know what I mean? Get that fly! No. They were more than just friends. I feel they're probably some of the greatest influences on music on a whole generation. We wanted it to be more than just a concert. We wanted it to be a celebration. Celebration of a beginning or an end? Beginning of the beginning of the end of the beginning. - Good evening.

We didn't know where we were going, we didn't know what it was. But, for some reason, it seemed like a good idea. We got to this place, a joint, in Fort Worth, Texas. It was burned out, bombed out. The roof wasn't even on the place any more. And that's when they decided to call it the Skyline Lounge. And we got there and set up and... A big place. Huge. Bar, way at the back and a big dance floor. - Real old. - So we set up the first night. We go down to the place to play. We go in and, in this huge place, there's about three people in the audience. A one-armed go-go dancer and a couple of drunk waiters. - A couple here, a couple there. - Somebody fires a tear gas... And a fight starts. There isn't enough people in the place to get angry. And we found out a few years later that it was Jack Ruby's club.

At one point, we had no more food money. It got to the point where, coming from Canada, we had these overcoats, big overcoats with pockets and everything, and we had a little routine. We'd go to the shopping centre, all together. - But I stayed home, right? - No, you didn't. I got the cigarettes. I turned the cigarette machine upside down and got everybody some cigarettes. - Yeah, but that was on the... - You got me some baloney. We'd go to the supermarket and a couple of people would buy a couple of loaves of bread, cos that was about the cheapest thing you could get. And the rest of us would be carousing the aisles, stuffing baloney. It'd be time to leave, the guy with the loaves would go to the checkout and we'd say "We'll meet you at the car. You take the bread out." - Ya'll come back! - And with these overcoats...

"Marshmallow Overcoat". Those kind of names. When we were working with Bob Dylan and we moved to Woodstock, everybody referred to us as The Band. He called us The Band. Our friends and neighbours called us The Band. And we started out with The Crackers. We tried to call ourselves The Honkies. Everybody kind of backed off from that, you know? It was too straight.

Fascinating. Scary. Kind of hard to take the first time. You have to go there about two or three times before you can fall in love with it. But that happens eventually. We stayed at the Times Square Hotel on 42nd Street. The title of the hotel, it sounded like it was conveniently located in midtown Manhattan. What did we know? We came out of the hotel after checking in, and you think "It's great to be back in New York." Movie theatres for ever. All these friendly women walking up and down the street. It was... It was great. Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion. It was an adult dose. So it took a couple of trips to get into it. You just go in the first time and you get your ass kicked and you take off. As soon as it heals up, you come back and you try it again. Eventually, you fall right in love with it. Roulette Records was in the middle of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley. The songwriting capital of the world. And we met some of the greatest songwriters ever. Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus. Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller. They were all then. Carole King. Neil Diamond. At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter was the low man on the totem pole. But then, these people... And here come the '60s, with change and revolution and war and assassinations, and a whole other frame of mind coming along. And these songwriters were expressing the feelings of people in the street. In a way, it was kind of the beginning of the end of Tin Pan Alley.

Thanks very much. When you started playing as The Band, you shied away from publicity a lot. Talk about that a little. That was just part of a lifestyle that we got to love in Woodstock. We got to like it, you know, just being able to chop wood or hit your thumb with a hammer. We'd be concerned with fixing a tape recorder, fixing a screen door. Stuff like that. And getting the songs together. We always seemed to get a whole lot more done when we didn't have a lot of company around. We were more productive. And as soon as company came, of course, we'd start having fun. You know what happens when you have too much fun. Something we've kind of evaded around here, but I'll ask it now. - What about women and the road? - I love 'em. That's probably why we've been on the road. - That's it. - Not that I don't like the music. I thought you weren't supposed to talk about it too much. - No, I guess we're not. - I thought we were supposed to... pan away from that sort of stuff, get into something else. Since the beginning, since we started playing together, just like we've all grown just a little bit, so have the women. - You know? And it's amazing. - That's right. That's good.

In my opinion, he's the best harp player, that's like harmonica, blues harmonica, that I've ever heard. He's the big Daddy of 'em. And he took us to a friend of his, a woman's place, who served food and corn liquor. In a southern booze can. He would sit there and he was playing for us. And we were getting drunk and trying to figure out where we were. He was spitting in a can. I thought he was dipping snuff. I thought he had something in his lip. And he kept spitting in this can and playing, and we kept getting drunker. Finally, I looked over in the can and I realised it was blood. He was getting pretty tired and pretty drunk by then. And we made big plans for the future and all kinds of things we were gonna do. And it was tremendous. A great night.

And we had to pay him $10 a week each for these music lessons. Then I was sure it was a riff. But then I found out what it really was. It was that, where he was coming from and his musical education, to tell his parents at this point that we was joining a rock-and-roll band would have been like pouring it down the drain. So he justified it to his people and his background by being a music teacher. There is a view that jazz is evil because it comes from evil people. But, actually, the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.

One was Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels. - What was that? - Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels. Yeah. They used to have the show start, right? They'd have the singers and the players and the different parts of the show. Then the master of ceremonies would come out just before the finale and explain that, after the kids go home, they'd have the midnight ramble. - The midnight...? - The midnight ramble. The songs would get a little bit juicier and the jokes'd get a little funnier. And the prettiest dancer would really get down and shake it a few times. A lot of the rock-and-roll duck walks and steps and moves came from a lot of that. Everybody did it and so, when you would see Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry or Bo Diddley really shaking it up, it didn't come out of nowhere, It didn't come out of the air. It was like the local entertainment everybody was going to see. So when they exposed it to the rest of the world, it was like this unknown beast that had come out, the grotesque of music that the devil had sent, you know? Here we go.

The road was our school. It gave us a sense of survival. It taught us all we know. There's not much left that we can really take from the road. We've had our share of... Or maybe it's just superstitious. - Superstitious in what way? - You can press your luck. The road has taken a lot of the great ones. Hank Williams. Buddy Holly. Otis Redding. Janis. Jimi Hendrix. Elvis. It's a goddamn impossible way of life. - It is, isn't it? - No question about it.
