ILLUSTRIOUS CORPSES I saw him naked and I helped clean him up. I never realized he was so small, so short. Yes, Inspector! Judge Varga used to come here every Sunday. He liked talking to the mummies. He'd make the dead reveal the secrets of the living. - He'd talk to the mummies? - Of course. You're from Rome. There are some things you can't understand. Open it. See him? Bernardo da Corleone. A great 17th century lawyer. In those days, the dead person's family would come here and tell the deceased their secrets. And our Don Bernardino, still alive at the time, would come down to the crypt at night and get the corpses to tell him everything. So he knew everything. Everything about everybody. "Let me talk about little white jasmines... " This fatal, just-picked blossom symbolizes the purity of his existence. And its scent evokes the goodness he brought to the courts and to his family. It's this jasmine that caught the last breath of Judge Varga, and passed it on to the ultimate Judge, who will admit him to His Kingdom. For thirty years he fought against crime and the Mafia and the Mafia has killed him. He was the Mafia! He was the Mafia! Organized crime had never been so daring before! It's the first time a judge has been murdered! - Mafia! You're the Mafia! - You're the Mafia! It's an appalling crime aimed against the whole judiciary! It's a challenge to the State's authority! Why is this leaflet linking your name to the dead judge and the garbage? They attack me because I was his best friend! What about the garbage? Come and have a look. You hear that? They're not striking for better pay. They even have cars to come to work in. They're starting a cholera epidemic just to screw me. Where does Judge Varga come into it? Varga was murdered because he was about to arrest them. Not these wretches, but their puppeteers. Quiet, quiet. He's dead. He has no pulse. Judge Varga knew every secret of this city. He had drawers full of court files. He acted on some when the time was right, but ignored the others. General, you were his friend. You admired him, didn't you? I liked the man. He wasn't in it for money. He thrived on power. Inspector. A phone call from Rome. I'm sorry. I need your authorization to move from here right away. - Why? Where? I guess you already know they killed another judge some 100 km from here. The two crimes may be linked. Go, but keep me informed. The Minister is concerned. The whole city mourns the tragic demise of judge SANZA who lived without marrying to fully dedicate his life to his native city which he had seen growing and multiplying during his thirty years of service - Shall we arrest him? - Why? - As usual, they won't talk. This guy heard nothing, saw nothing, knows nothing. Parisi! Do you get many lemons? A lot, but they want to out everything down to build houses. Tell me something... did you know the judge? Of course. He issued the dispossession notices. What was he like? Like this town. This is what they wanted. - Maresciallo. - At your orders. Is this you? Maybe. Did you bring us all this way just to identify a picture? You were at Judge Varga's funeral. Were you a friend of his? We had ceased to be on friendly terms. But when he was a junior judge... - When you killed that unionist. - Everyone was acquitted. Sure. But this time you've gone too far. You shouldn't mess with judges. Inspector, you're wasting your time with us. And you know it. If it's payback, as you call it, that's between the judges. NATIONAL BANK Brave Chief Judge Calamo is dead. He's the third judge to be killed. The police do nothing to stop this mad slaughter. And their inertia gives rise to all sorts of speculation. We're being killed off and our reputations are tarnished. But the judiciary is sound, the Parliament is ineffective. The government is weak. They're the reason the country is plunging into chaos. Find me that raving maniac! Only a maniac would go around killing judges. Listen to me. You're the Chief of Police, your head will be the first to roll. You're our best man, but if I go down you're going first. At least stop the damaging stories about the murdered judges! What's this? The late Chief Judge Calamo had them in a drawer. He had several millions in the bank. - What on earth are you doing? - Piecing together three lives. Don't waste time with the dead. We need someone who's alive and guilty. Stop this nonsense! You're looking for rationality, but we're dealing with a paranoid. If he's paranoid, he's an innocent one. What did you mean by "innocent paranoidâ€œ? Three judges have been killed in twenty days, in three towns quite near each other, all killed the same way, by bullets of the same caliber, shot from the same gun. A gun with a silencer. - Enough evidence to suggest a vendetta. - By whom? A victim of a miscarriage of justice. Do you know whether the three judges Varga, Sanza and Calamo ever worked together on a case? Yes. They worked together for eight years, right here. Sir. The plane is ready to take off. Actually I thought there'd be another killing in this town, and I was right. I was here when they shot Calamo. Then the papers are right: you're a jinx. Now I have my definite opinion. Three innocent people who live in this area were unjustly sent to jail for several years. A chemist ruined by his wife, who tricked the judges, a mechanic rumored to be gay, and a truck driver who's now a hobo. - So, what's your next step? - One of these three people is the killer. - How are things? - Bad. - What's bad? - Everything. - And before? - Before what? - Were things better before? - No. So? 80... Here we are. What do you think about these judges being killed? Were you sentenced by Varga? He was the prosecuting judge in that trial. He asked for 30 years. He said he regretted there was no death penalty. Did Chief Judge Sanza deliver the sentence? Judge Sanza gave me a discount... 27 years. - But he wasn't alone. - I know. Judge Rasto was there too. And Rasto is still alive. What do you want from me? Later they proved I was innocent. Right. You were innocent and spent four years in jail, unjustly. 52 years of my life have been spent unjustly. Spending four of them in jail was no big deal. Jail is a safe place. - What do you want? - Police. Leave me alone! You've already made my life miserable! Go away! Come here. Do you remember Judge Varga, Chief Judge Sanza and Calamo? Bastards! They were all bastards. - And you killed them. - I wish I had. Do you live here? Do you have a gun? - Go and get it. - You get it. Clear off! Don't answer me like that. Understand? - What shall we do? - Nobody saw him. He might be sleeping. - Stay here and keep an eye out for him. - Yes, Sir. - Mr. Mama, phase. - That's. me. - Can I help you? - I'm Inspector Rogas. I'd like to have a word with you. At your service. Excuse me, I'll be back shortly. - Please, sit down. - Thanks. I wanted to talk to you because I've been told you're the only friend of the chemist, Cres. Friend... It's hard using the term friendship with a man like Cres. Let's say I get to meet him. - You see him often? - Yes. Actually, I'm the one who goes to him. I try to get him out of his shell, and give him a chance to meet other people. - Have you seen him today? - No. I think he's been staying home all day. I knocked on his door, but no one answered. He does it all the time. He pretends he's not home, even with me. - You mean it's happened to you too? - Yes, often. Are you sure that Cres used to stay always home? That he didn't go out? Dear Inspector, as far as I know, the only trips Cres takes are inside the walls of his own house. He's not here. So, it's not true that he's always home. Maybe he's left and switched the meter off. Let me take a look. What's this music? Cres is crazy about tangos. He has thousands of them, let me show you. Tangos of all kinds, from all countries. He's put speakers all over the house. That's Cres' wife. She used the Animal Protection Agency to frame him. Do you think Cres was innocent too? He prepared the chocolate rice. My husband used to cook it all the time! Still any doubt? No! Unless you think that poor woman designed such a diabolical scheme to incriminate her husband, to the point of sacrificing an innocent animal, her cat, that had for years been the only companion in her lonely existence? It's an absurdity. He wanted to murder his wife. He set up a fake suicide. You must find him guilty. - The woman, where is she now? - Nobody knows. She took off while he was still in jail. She took almost everything with her and left him only her portrait. And he placed it in front of his bed. Sir. Is this headless picture Cres? I think so. Maybe his wife did it out of spite. - This is you, who's the other one? - Probably Cres. Probably? - Don't you have any pictures of Cres? - I used to, but he took them all back. - Who is it? - I'm Inspector Rogas. Come in. The judge is waiting for you. Come in. The police Inspector is here. - Your honor. - Good evening. Inspector Rogas. - Please sit down. - Thank you. - Will you excuse me for a moment? - Certainly. Well? Forgive me for calling on you at this hour. But I've been trying in vain to see Mr Cres, the chemist. His house is locked up and nobody answers. What do you want with the chemist? Nothing in particular. I looked up his file... a strange case indeed. Any story is useless when there's no man in it. I want to meet him. Cres' trial has no link with what's happening nowadays. It was much talked about. And the sentence was very controversial. Weren't you one of the judges? I was only the recorder. The decision was made by Judge Varga and Chief Judge Sanza. And they've both been killed. Forty meters. They fired from over there. There's no doubt. - Who lives there? - It's empty, there's no caretaker either. A fire was still burning. The killer must have spent the night there. He must have known the judge's habits pretty well. - The corpse can be removed now. - There's an ambulance strike. We called the airport, in order to have someone else. Use one of our cars. Do you need the union's approval? Were you really here when he was shot? Not really. I met Judge Rasto last night, but I didn't kill him! - Why did you visit the judge? - Just routine. You have no clues? Four judges have been killed since you began investigating. Gentlemen, talk to the chief. Inspector, we have to write our articles, the people must know! Who shot? We don't know yet. Hey! Look who's here! One judge is a concern for the police. Four, and it's a political matter If it's politics, you're here to explain everything. - Don't you read the papers? - No, especially yours. - Good! - Let's get away from here. Your colleagues won't give me any peace! Let's go. Too bad you don't read our paper; it's the only one defending you. - Defending me? How? - We're not into witch hunts. We're not looking for a maniac at all costs. We don't want to raise the tension. We want you to do your job without any interference from above. Is that what you write? Well done. Sometimes the police even suit the Communist Party! - Yes, if they do their job like you do. - I do it well for you. Because we were school mates and we go fishing together. But your friends always think it's a political matter! That's your friends in the government, and they play dirty politics. Listen, you can tell me. - What's behind all this? - None of what you might think. Nor what my friends in the government think. I'll tell you a story, if you promise you won't write a word of it. A nice story. It's about a man, his wife and a cat. - This one? - No. This one? No, not at all. This one? This one looks like him, but it's only a drawing, not a photo! That's enough, we need to put an end to all this! You! Give me your description again. "Wanted. A man, 175 cm tall, sturdy, with graying hair, perfect teeth, slightly aquiline nose. " JUDGE ASSASSINATED JUDGE PERRO SHOT DEAD AT 6:30PM IN ROME These brutal and appalling crimes - MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OF STATE - are an attack on law, order, and the authorities. They are the diabolical fruit of the actions of groups of young agitators, who preach violence as a means to an end, and sow the seeds of delirium in weaker minds. It is time to say â€œEnough, we must resist together!â€œ Have you seen the murderers? I heard a shot and saw two young boys run away. That's all. - Were you passing by at that time? - Yes, but I heard nothing. I was on my bike when those two knocked me over. - Why were you at the scene of the crime? - I wasn't, I work down there. I'm a printer. I went out to get some fresh air. I heard a woman shout and saw him getting away on his bike. At last! While you waste your time trying to catch your crazy maniac, the real lunatics are exterminating the judges, and ruining the country! It was you who talked about a maniac, you even came to tell me. - But you were there, and you should have seen what you didn't want to see! - What do you mean? - Please, sit down. - What I mean is they were everywhere. At Varga's funeral, where Sanza was killed... They even setup camp there! This is not serious evidence, it can't be used to accuse anyone of murder. Didn't you hear that there are eyewitnesses to Judge Perro's murder? Nobody has seen them shooting, just running away. Enough talk! You're an excellent detective, Rogas. The best criminal investigator we've got. But now this has become a political affair. We've already made too many mistakes. The good name of the police must be restored; it's in your interest too. You will work with the political squad and Inspector Bloma. This way. Before they fuck me, I'll ruin them! I'm telling everything! - That'd be bad for everybody. - I don't give a damn! You can tell them! I have ten boxes full of documents, they're hidden in Switzerland! Did you talk to the Customs Police? - Yes, but they won't give us the tapes. - Why? Everyone's blackmailing each other: Customs Police, Police and Carabinieri. They took the money, but they won't give us the tapes... - This goes straight to the Minister. - Yes, Sir. Are you still recording phone calls? - Where are you keeping all these tapes? - Don't worry. They'll get rid of them, at the courthouse. Come with me. Rogas, come here! Isn't that your communist friend over there, the journalist? - Is he being watched too? - No, only their leader, Amar. "Times are difficult. " "This meeting must end with a clear decision. " "A party like ours can't be caught off guard by the actions of the government. " Let's see what they're sending us now. Courthouse. Please, write. When questioned, he answered: "I used to go to Rome every month, and delivered the checks coming from the Oil Companies to the head of the Christian Democratic Party, who was responsible for their distribution, according to the quota, to all other Parties, except the Communist Party. " - Nothing to the Communist Party? - No, just to some affiliates of theirs. Only once, but not much. Put in the tape of the â€œ2 Group... Yes, Sir. We are monitoring all these groups' publications, written in the last few months, especially the articles that attack the Judges. Can I have the article from "Permanent Revolution"? Thanks. This is the newspaper written by â€œGroup 2â€œ. This is Galano, head of "Group 2". The most fanatical. There are some other tough ones - listen to what they say about judges! The article is titled â€œThe Monsters... "Bony and withered, more often fat and flabby, their faces marked by infamy, dressed like clowns, as bishops wouldn't dare. These are the high magistrates who inaugurate the judicial year, telling us to lock up more people and keep them there. - Stand up! - Who, me? Yes, you. Stand up. - Start walking. - Where? Just walk until we tell you to stop. Turn around and walk. Walk. Do you recognize him? Is that him? Quick, turn around! Keep on walking. Go ahead! Come on. Do you recognize him? Let's start again. Two young boys bumped into you and you fell off your bike. I didn't say I fell. I was knocked over. Same thing. You saw them run away. The dark-skinned guy was limping. I didn't see any dark-skinned guy. It doesn't matter. He did limp, though! - Maybe, but it was so quick! - How quick? Just one second... Then they got into the car. A car? You never mentioned a car before. You never gave me a chance. You kept asking about the young boys. Let the girl in. Sit here. - You saw the car? - What car? There was a car when they shot Perro. - Yes, a big foreign car. - Foreign? What do you mean? Why didn't you tell us about the car? What's the car got to do with this? I see so many cars! I work with cars. - Was the car parked? - Yes, it was. I went up to it to see if I could do some business... That's why I noticed it was big, nice and foreign. - Swiss. - Then what? They started the engine and left. - With the young boys? - What young boys? The hippies, the ones that were getting away. They started running and I saw them get into the car. No way! The car left and the hippies just ran away. Let's start again. This is your statement: I'll read it to you. "It was 6 PM, I was walking by the courthouse building. I was about to cross the street, when I noticed my shoe strap was undone. I bent down to tie it up and heard a shot. " - What next? - When I heard the shot, I turned around. - What did you see? - Two young boys running. - They bumped into him. - And then? They ran away and went around the corner. The car left right away, in the opposite direction. He didn't see anything, he was leaning over the dead man. No, I insist. They got into the car. You were scared stiff, with your ass on the ground! You didn't see anything. Bloma, I've been thinking about it. I won't work with anyone else. Maybe the chief is right when he says I'm not made for this. Maybe you're right. A break will do you good. Yes, but first I have to do something, to ease my conscience. I have to tell a guy he's about to die. Easy, one at a time. No, I can't answer. We are following a definite trail. As soon as we know something certain, we'll let you know. Good morning, Inspector. May I speak to Chief Judge Riches? - Who are you? - Inspector Rogas. Wait here. - Inspector, the Chief Judge asks you to come back tomorrow at 8 PM. - Very well. That's the Chief of Police's car. Is he having a meeting with the President? Why are you asking? At least get in touch with the boy. We have to pay the school fees. - Don't worry, I'll do it tomorrow. - Marco is moaning; he says he never sees you. - When did you see him? - Last Sunday, as usual. - Was he all right? - Yes, he was fine. - Don't forget the school fees. - Yes, bye. News update. Today, General Edoardo De Sarmiento was appointed Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The new Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces received the Commanders in chief of the Air Force, the Army and the Navy. The ceremony included a parade of the various Corps, along with Police Special Units. Various diplomats were attending the parade... Today, General Edoardo De Sarmiento was appointed Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The new Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces received the Commanders in chief of the Air Force, the Army and the Navy. - Rogas? - Yes. Good evening, Sir. - Why did you go to Chief Judge Riches? - I wanted to warn him; he's in danger. You still insist on chasing your lunatic. The Chief Judge will be killed by my lunatic or by your groups. The Chief Judge is well protected. I know. All the General Staff looked after him today, and I saw your car, too. We weren't at Riches', we were attending a reception at the Portuguese Embassy nearby. You can go and see Riches, but don't alarm him. - Hello. Is this the Portuguese Embassy? - Yes, who's speaking? I'm the Chief of Police's chauffeur. I'm sorry, but my boss forgot his briefcase at today's reception. What reception? The embassy has been closed for a week. - The ambassador is in Lisbon. - I'm sorry, there must have been a mistake. Thank you. - Yes? - It's Rogas. I need you to do something. Find the owner of a white Mercedes with a Swiss plate. Is that everything you know? The first two numbers are 9 and 7. You find out the others. Sit down, please. - So... you think I'll be killed. - Yes. I believe they'll try. The subversives or that other guy? The other guy... Cres. Ah, that's right... the chemist. He tried to kill his wife, his plan was too naive. What did he get? - 5 years, upheld by you on appeal. - Not by me. I meant by the court over which you presided. - So? - He was innocent. - Really? - I think so. Was he innocent, or is that just what you believe? I do think he was innocent, but I can't be sure. - So, you can't be sure about it. - I think it was an error, a miscarriage of justice. Miscarriages of justice don't exist. - Are you a catholic churchgoer? - Not a churchgoer. - But you're a catholic nevertheless. - Sure, like everyone else. I presume you go to Mass from time to time. Have you ever considered the issue of bread and wine, turning into the body and blood of Christ? Every time... Every time the priest eats that bread and drinks that wine, the mystery occurs. This always happens. The priest may be unworthy in thought or deed, but simply due to his Ordination, every time the Mass is celebrated the mystery occurs. When the Judge delivers the Law, he is exactly like a priest celebrating Mass. The judge may have doubts, he may question himself, he may even torment himself. But at the very moment he delivers his sentence... he can't harbor any doubt. At that moment justice is done. Always? Once, a priest who was breaking the host found blood on his robe. Because he had doubts. That has never happened to me. No sentence has ever left blood on my hands. No conviction has ever left blood on my gown. It's always a matter of faith. I don't think you've quite understood. I'm not a Catholic. Nor am I a Christian. I've never had such weaknesses. I've never believed in Voltaire's â€œA Treatise on Toleranceâ€œ. He started all this nonsense about miscarriages of justice. Virtue, mercy, innocent victims fallen prey of errors. What error? A judge who can freely km with his sentence. Voltaire was the first to sow doubts about the judicial system. When a religion starts to be concerned about people's doubts, that religion is already dead. That's why we had Bertrand Russell, Sartre, Marcuse... and the delirium of today's youth. So it's all Voltaire's fault. Yes, but Voltaire had an excuse. At the time they didn't realize the danger inherent in these ideas, but today's masses have made that danger lethal. If things go on like this, the only viable form of justice will be what soldiers call "decimationâ€œ. Punishment by killing one soldier out of ten. Nowadays, there are no individuals any more! There is no individual responsibility any more! Your job, my dear friend, has become ridiculous. It was fine in times of peace, but now we're at war. Robberies, kidnappings, murders, sabotage... This is war! As in war the answer is: decimation. One, two, three, four, five... Out! One, two, three, four, five... Out! One, two, three, four, five... Cres, convicted! Cres has a. 22 caliber gun and it's loaded with a bullet with your name on it. Park down there. All the way back! Go on! Go on! Stop! Who lives below Chief Judge Riches? - Mr. Pattos. - Pattos... the shipowner? - Yes. Inspector, Mr. Pattos is here. What are you doing here? - Excellency, I didn't think... - You didn't think what? That you'd meet me at my friend Pattos' place? I didn't think I'd be intruding on a reunion of friends. - Too late now. So? - I was looking for someone. - Looking for me? No, someone who just came in. Do you think he's here among my guests? Come in. Inspector, I'm sure you were looking for me. Are you here to arrest me? My dear Evaristo, you are a big liar. You always denied that the police tapped our phones. The inspector's presence here proves my case. - Is it true? - Not that I know of. How amazing! He asks if it's true. And he answers that it's not! I know nothing about phone tapping. I know it's done sometimes, but always with a judge's approval, and only for criminal suspects. But never for political reasons. It's impossible. That means I'm a criminal suspect, since my phone is definitely tapped. I mean the phone where I live, not mine. Nocio's phone. Where's the great liberal writer? You are not my guest. You're my wife's guest. I would have never had an intellectual asshole like you as my guest! They want to start a permanent revolution! You wish the Inspector had come here to arrest you; you'd become a hero. - Wilfredo, don't be ridiculous! - Shut up! This is how conservative you are: "Shut up!". Just because I'm a woman and your wife! No, because you're a parrot, not a woman! There's nothing to do. You're atypical communist, catholic and bourgeois. Yes, for a long time. I didn't wait for the latest fashion! Now that we are winning, communists, catholics, the bourgeoisie, you're all queuing up to jump on the bandwagon! - No, I won't take this! - This asshole wanted to start a revolution! Gentlemen, let's stop these family quarrels. We're here to enjoy ourselves, to eat and drink something. - Champagne? Would you rather have some whiskey? - No, thanks. Have a drink, Rogas. You're not on duty. Your assignment here is over. Come with me. Did you hear? To them it's all a game. - A game? It doesn't seem a game. - Yes, a game. I'm playing the game too. I'm in the middle of it. Giving both protection and threats. Don't let appearances fool you, Rogas. Everybody's sure they've already won, but they're still scared. Maybe more than before. When the party's over, they'll flee in all directions. No one will sleep in his bed tonight. - Who do they fear? - They'll think that you and I were part of a plot... and that your sudden appearance was planned. My dear Rogas, subversive groups like Galano's are useful to us. - And to our Communist Party friends. - Friends? Your know what the situation is like. My party, which has been badly running the country for 30 years, will be forced to badly rule with the Communists. Your own job would be easier, Rogas, if Amar, head of that party, already had my chair. The ministry of safety would work, and I'd have fun watching Mr. Amar on my chair, oppressing these small groups. So, what should we do? Keep going. Keep harassing these small groups as much as you can. Arrests, controls, searches. But always with the approval of the judges, who won't withhold it. - They keep on killing them! - Are you still thinking of arresting Galano? At least give us our minister back! Hang around, Rogas. We'll continue our conversation. Hot coffee and cold milk. Waiter, a whiskey. Find out who they are and what they want from me. How? We're always being watched. If they find out, I'm finished too. I didn't tell you to do it in there. Why don't you use your own lab? You did it for the oil companies. Give me a cigarette. Come on. Thanks. Placing a bug under the chief of police's ass. Big fucking shit! And now, Minister, allow me to address a burning issue. Ever since I left the house of the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court, I've had the feeling that I'm being followed by professionals. I mean, people specifically suited to that task. As if trained in a state or private police corps. If people in high places deemed it necessary to give me protection I can only be grateful. But, at the same time, I want to point out that such surveillance, which is very expensive, with so many officers involved, would be better employed in protecting the judges. You'll never get out of here unless you confess first! And that goes for everybody! To the Minister of Safety It's the tanks; the motors run all night. They're holding a meeting at the armored division barracks. Listen, this is him. "Let's be careful with these judges. " Stop! Play it again. . These judges. Let's be careful with these judges. Rogas is on our back and he's already figured out too much. " Come on, once more. . These judges. Let's be careful with these judges. Rogas is on our back and he's already figured out too much. " - What next? - Next? Isn't that enough? - Rogas? - Yes. Good evening, Sir. Why did you go to Chief Judge Riches? I wanted to warn him; he's in danger. You still insist on chasing your lunatic. The Chief Judge will be killed by my lunatic or by your groups. - The Chief Judge is well protected. - I know. All the General Staff looked after him today, and I saw your car, too. It's a plot. The chemist Cres killed his judges, and now they keep killing the others. We've come across so many plots - they arrange one a day. We've always managed to keep a close watch on the situation. But this time you've got to do something fast, or something bad will happen. You must understand, we can't risk jeopardizing everything. You talk this way. I'm not saying you should start a revolution before their counter-revolution, but you have to inform the Parliament or the press. We can't alarm a whole country just because of some â€œfeelings... What feelings? I have evidence. They're all involved! If that's the case, it's no use discussing it any further between us. You must see Amar. Only the party secretary can decide. Amar is like all the others to me. In a room of the National Gallery a group of visitors discovered two bodies. The police have now identified the victims, Mr. Amar, the secretary of the Communist Party, and police Inspector Amerigo Rogas. Both victims were shot using the same weapon, the gun that Inspector Rogas was still holding in his hand. Here's the Chief of Police's assessment of the facts. Inspector Rogas had just returned from a very stressful mission, conducted out of the city, searching for the judges' killer. When he returned to Rome he started showing signs of mental disorder, as a result he was placed on leave. He was seeing plots everywhere, and started looking for non-existent evidence. Maybe he thought that even the secretary of the Communist Party was part of this imaginary plot. He killed him and then he killed himself. We have already accepted this version of events. Everything points to him being the killer. I don't believe it, I knew Rogas. He was no lunatic. There was a plot. They felt so confident, they went all the way. And now they came up with this last provocation. A police Inspector who kills the party secretary. Even if what you say is true, would you start a civil war? A real clash? No, but I don't want to be an accomplice. Accomplice? We would be if we took part in their game. They want to unleash the masses! That's what they want! So, people will never know the truth. Truth is not always revolutionary.
