- All right, Happy! Bring it home! - Hit him, hit him! Get in there! - Come on, Happy! - Come on! Come on, Happy! - Happy! - Stop messing around! - He's got this. - Stop messing around out there! Nobody can touch Happy McBride! Nobody! Nobody will! - That's another knockout win for Happy McBride. - Jab him one. Use your left. Stick him when he clowns. Wait for it. Wait for it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Owen, move your head. Left, use your left. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's you, Owen. Damn it, Owen, you've got to stop the take down! - Happy, you gonna help me out or are you just gonna watch? - I can't take my eyes off you. It's like watching a train wreck. - Take him to the ground! Drop the left! There it is. You guys ain't done, get up. - You know, you're right, you know? The only chance that guy had was on the floor. Even with the size advantage. - Owner's over there, man. - I didn't come to see him. You're Happy McBride, man. - No, I'm not. Happy McBride is taller and apparently a lot smarter than me. I can't help you, kid, okay? I don't have the time. - Okay, well if you'll just take a look. I made this reel for you. It's short because I know you must be busy, superstar and all. - You came here for me? - Yeah. - From where? - From New York. Internet has you working out at this gym, so I came here. It's small stuff, I know. But six and 0, I'm undefeated. Kinda like you. - Oh, next big thing, huh? - Not like you, you know, but most of the write-ups said that I had promise. Time to go pro though. I mean, the average time a guy starts picking up injuries, is what, approximately eight fights? - You got that down to a science? - Closing time, lights out! You don't have to go home but you can't stay here. - This shouldn't be any different than any other business. Should it? - It is. You don't talk like any fighter I know. Did you go to a good school? - Yeah, a few years in college and private school before that, but nothing special. - You should go back, okay? Everybody and their brother's trying to get into this now. You can't get in. You gotta be connected, you gotta have money. - I have money. I have 1,700 bucks, thank you very much. - Well, that's barely enough to get a foot in the door. - Okay, well you know which door to put it in. - You're not giving up, are you? All right, listen. I got a ride coming, but let's see you throw a few. - All right, against you? - As if. Al! Hundred bucks in it for you if you knock this guy out. - Does he have the hundred? - He has the hundred. Go to it, boys. Whenever you're ready, Al. I got your green. - What do you think of my two-three? I've been working on it. - Show me. - Your boy's got some D, huh? Slippin' and dippin'? - Finish this. - Fuck! - It's okay. Just breathe. - Did you do that on purpose? - The liver is nine ribs down. It's center of circulation so all the blood flows there. - You win, I get half. - Yeah, seems a little steep. - Plus, you pay expenses. I get you one fight. - Name's Matthew Bradford. - The funds, Matthew Bradford. - Oh, now? - Yeah, I can't put myself out there and then find out you don't have it anymore. I don't know you. - Well, I don't know you either. - Well, who am I? - You know I know. - Who am I, Al? - Undisputed heavyweight champ. - You know me. What's it gonna be? I got a ride waiting. Okay, five o'clock tomorrow. - Early start. Here? - Here. Hey, honey. - Hey, Dad. - No, no, no, no, no, no. I'll drive. - Oh, come on. That's not gonna happen again. - I've got some much to live for, honey. - No trust? - Ah. - Another fighter? - More of the same. - I thought you were going to do your own thing after this last one. I'm fine, Dad. - How do you say, I'm fine, in French? - Oh, my God. That's a lot of French. Hey. There he is. - You're a little late. - Yeah, well. I'm sorry about that. Business is good. What do you got going here? - Everything I need in there except a shower, but gym membership for that, so. - What's with that poster? - Oh, that's pre-med. - Pre-med? Liver. - Right. - Yeah. You ready? - Mm-hmm. - All right, let's do it. - I was a little confused at first. I thought we were going to a gym or something. - A gym, why a gym? - Well, to train. I mean, you're gonna be my manager and all. - No, no, no, no. Don't even say that out loud. I'm nobody's manager, man. I don't just put my own thing aside and get a few guys going. Hey! - What's your own thing? - Are you kidding me with that? - What? You're fighting again? - Must be happy hour, huh? - Yeah. - Always happy hour when you're here. - I thought you'd retired. - Why would you think that? - It's been like eight years. - The hell it has. - Well, you won your last one when I was 10. It was actually my 10th birthday and I just turned 18. - Okay. - I didn't mean anything by that. I mean, you look like you could fight today. It's just been so long that, you know. - Enough. Bring up that stuff on the internet. What is this? I'm talking about your fight footage. - It's the stuff we were talking about earlier. - Where are you going? When are you coming home? What about us? - Turn that off. - Okay, I'll get the reel. - How does it get on there? - It must've been on TV or something, I don't know. - Oh, there he is, right on time. Guy puts on fights. Unsanctioned, but he draws a good audience, so. He's got one tonight. You're the opener. - What? Really? Just like that? This is great. I mean, I just came here two days ago. - Bet you wish your dad could see you now, huh? - What does that mean? - Well, he couldn't have been too happy about you giving up school to get punched in the face. - Can we talk about something else, please? - We could talk about why my picture's not up on the wall anymore. - People keep stealing them, Happy. - Yeah. - So who am I fighting? - I don't see him, but I do see a lot of people here who mean something. - I heard about this kind of thing before. - There he is. - Ah. What's up, Hap? - Is he not your guy, too? - I told you. None of you are my guy. Huh? - What's up, Happity Hap? What's going on, baby? - Over my left shoulder. - Seriously? - Listen to me. You do not go toe to toe with this guy. This guy will pick you apart. Do not fight that guy standing. Look at me. Take him to the ground, okay? - Are you kidding me right now? - Take him to the ground. - Man, I'm not worried about this guy. - Take him to the ground, take him to the ground. I'm telling you. Are you listening? - Better not be my big fight. - Take him to the ground. Do not let you take him to the ground, whatever you do. You stay on your feet, you pick him apart. - You're managing both of us in the same fight? - I promised him a little help. Two birds, one stone. - Shouldn't the birds be in the same weight class? - Unsanctioned. - Welcome to another fight night at Victor's. Ultra violent mixed martial arts. All right. I'm gonna lay down some rules for you guys. I want you to listen very close. No biting. No strikes to the spine. Let's go to what does go and that is everything else. - This one's a stare down. Don't ever think I saw Cray Cray smile. - Ready? Fight! - That's the right idea. Grab him this time. - What're you waiting for? Cray, to the ground! Get ready to stuff him! You know what's coming! Stuff him! Deliver it, Matt! That's it, Matt. Same thing. - You guys really think this fool can take me? He couldn't hit me with a baseball-- - We're gonna keep clowning around until he hurts you! Take him to the ground! Don't let him take you to the ground! Matt, twist your hips! Slip out! Tighter! Matt, twist out! That's good work, Cray. That's it. - Yeah! - Ow. Yeah, I need to speak to Happy. - How many times do I gotta tell you? Who is this, Bobby again? Listen, I never know when he's gonna be here, all right? Stop calling! - It's not Bobby. I wanna leave a message for when Happy McBride-- Hello, hello? - License and registration, son. - Didn't I see you at the Gulag? - Yes, you did. I'm hard to miss. - I'm looking for Happy. - So is a lot of guys. How much did he get you for? - All of it. - All of it. Well. You didn't hear it from me, but he's never very far from his daughter. There's a little diner called Cadillac Jack's, that's where she works. It's Saturday, big tip day. He's gonna be there taking her tips because that's what he does. That's what Happy does. He takes. He just takes and takes 'cause he's a bad guy. He's scum. He's gonna pretend to be your friend and then he's gonna gut you. Do you understand that? - Just get out of here, man. - Cadillac Jack's. Pop your head in there, you might find him. You've got the van, you might as well kill him. - Can I get you something? - Only if my friend shows up. - Want this while you wait? - I actually don't have any money to pay for this. - I know. - I'm not a bum or anything. I just got robbed. Not the usual way, but still. - Sorry to hear it. - Was that French, too? How many languages do you speak? - Enough. But what I really wanna do is become a fighter. - A fighter, huh? Why is that? - Money, fame, chicks. - So, what's stopping you from doing it besides knowing how to punch? - Oh, I know how to punch. Oh, come on. - How'd you know what I do? - Wasn't the way you talk. - Yeah, so I've heard. You don't really talk like anyone else either. That accent from all the languages you speak or? - I spent some time in Montreal when I was younger with my mom. - Nice. Seriously, though. How'd you know I fight? - I don't know. It's this feeling you give me. - Thanks. - Didn't say that was a good thing though. - But I could get two of these pair for the price of one of these pair. - I mean, it comes down to how superstitious you are. Oh, there you go. - He's the man. - Hey, thank God for small favors. I thought you were dead. - So, you left me in a parking lot. - You didn't pay enough for a funeral. - You gonna ask me in? - Well. I will ask you what you're doing here and who told you where I live. - I paid you enough money to get a decent fight. - And what would you call what you got? - Well, we both know the truth about that, so I'm gonna need my money back. - Whoa. - Well, you can wither give me my money back or you can get me another fight. - You want another fight, pay for another fight. - It took six fights to get that money. - Well, fight six more times. - I'd rather you do the right thing. I'm not leaving here until you do. - You just left. I'm up! - Happy, you've had the next world champ three times in the last year. - I know, I know. I'm almost embarrassed to be here. But Benny, with this one, I don't want you saying that I didn't tell you about him. All right? Have a good day, bud. - Wait, that's it? Just like that? - Yeah. Look, this is the one I'm throwing you in appreciation for those other bums. - Oh, this is that one? - Yeah. - But you're not pitching him? - Thanks for your time, brother. See you, bud. You need his name. - That would help. - You need his name so when you see him fight you'll know we're even. - I've been waiting years for some payback from you. - Name's Matt. - Matt. Okay, what's his last name. - He doesn't go by his last name. He likes to use a nickname, like a lot of these guys. - And what is it? - He likes to use The Doctor. - The Doctor? - The Doctor, yes. Write that down. - The Doctor. - Look for him. - Wait a minute. Why do they call him The Doctor? - They call him The Doctor because he's like a surgeon with his punches. This guy, liver, kidneys, pancreas, bam! - Duodenum? - I don't know what that is, but I'm sure he does 'cause this kid went to medical school just to learn where all that stuff is. - Ah. - Matt The Doctor? - Right. I'll see you, bud. - I got nothing here. You gave me nothing. - Benny, this is you and me. I'm just showing you the same love you've shown me. All right? I'll see you. - All right, hold on. For the love, I'm gonna bite. - Oh, really? You fight on Friday! - Just like that? For who? - My friend Benny Stone here. Pays 3K. That's headliner money in a regional. $500 advance. - Is the other guy a middleweight? - Will you stop? You ever hear of Rick The Kick? - Yeah, of course. Three and 0, two by knockout. - You got anything to do but memorize that stuff? - I do, actually. So, how'd that happen? - How'd it happen? What's my name? - If it was that easy, why didn't you do the right thing in the first place? - We just have a different opinion about them. - Well, if you still think you did the right thing, why fix it? - Because it's easier than killing you. - I see. - What're you doing now? - It's gotta be the right way, Hap, or else we just keep starting over. - You know what you're walking away from? There's no way. There's no way! You're not... I kept my promise, man! I kept my promise! All right! I'm not entirely comfortable with what happened to you at Victor's. - Can't risk you spending it. - Also, you get 30 percent, not 50. Plus you get to train me for this fight. That would leave you with a 50. - That leaves you 50 away from a dentist. - Well, then it's a good thing that the last thing I want isn't money. It's getting a little claustrophobic in here. - My room has one bed. - That's fine, we'll alternate. I'll go first. What the? - Who are you? Who are you? - What the? - Why you do floor? - I sleep floor, what you think? - Well, who he? Who is he? - He's one of my fighters, he's one of my guys. - Why sleep here? Huh, in your bed? - Will you get dressed? You're scaring him. - Fun, Hap, you funny. You love it! - Hey! Hey, come on! Ow! It's okay, it's okay! - Why sleep here? Why sleep? - I love you, Kitty! Goddamn. She's a wild cat. Woo! Hoo-hoo! - So, I was kina hoping that would've lasted longer. - Yeah, well. She only know about 10 words of English. Throw in this room. Damn near perfect. - The room? She pays? - Well, it's her motel. Actually, it's her husband's. So if you think about it, she's totally perfect. You're still aiming for the bag. Punch through the bag. Come on, through it. Through it! - Say, Happy. I don't like to get in your business, man, but that Calvin Cray, or whatever he calls himself, was hanging around earlier, looking kinda serious. Well, keep your head on a swivel, brother. Why do you keep messing with these guys anyway? Look at this? Are you kidding me? Are you serious, man? - Got any tape on Rick The Kick there, Skinny? - Bullshit. You telling me he's fighting Rick? - Are you kidding me, Skinny? He got Rick? What am I doing here? Am I the only person in this gym that knows I'm the contender? - Not anymore. - Rick The Kick. Man's scary. - Scary when you see a guy with a lot of fights who still looks good. - Hey, Happy-Go-Lucky. - Hey, Benny. - How are you? Good to see you. - You, too. Meet the next champ. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Stone. - Pleasure's mine, Champ. You know, that would make this a collector's item. It's your first poster as a pro. - Cool, I'll frame it. The Doctor? - Yes, sir, The Doctor. There you go, that's yours. Now, this is your contract. Right there's the title page. There's the blah, blah, blah, boilerplate. And then you come around here to the signature page and you put yours right there on the pretty spot. - All right, I'll just look at the-- - Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on. Just... Just sign it. - You don't need to take a look? - It's all boilerplate for you at this point. - Sign it. - Boilerplate, okay. - Excellent. Done deal. Congratulations, you're on your way, Doctor. - Thank you, sir. - Catch your later. - Excuse me, is your name Happy McBride? - No, you got the wrong guy, man. - You look just like the guy my son, Matt, saw on the internet. - Oh. New York. Sorry, man. A lot of people come here looking for me, so. - That's exactly what he told his mother he'd do. - He did. I told him I'm not a manager though. - You have seen him? - Yeah. A couple days ago. - Can you tell him where I can find him? - I have no idea. He's pretty beat up. I'll tell you what would be my guess. Probably beat you back to New York. Probably beat you back. - What're you doing? - What am I doing? What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm giving you information. You ask me a question, I give you the answer. What do you want from me? - Well, help me find my son. Would you, please? - I told you what I know. He came, I told him, I couldn't help him. He left. I'm a fighter, I'm not a manager. - Oh, Matthew, right? Matt? - Yeah, Nikki, right? - Your eye looks a lot better than it did. - Yeah, you look great as well. - Would you like a coffee? - Uh, ice tea would be preferable. - Sure. - Thank you. - I was gonna ask you how you ended up on my doorstep. - Yeah, I followed her. - What a coincidence seeing the two of you together. - Oh, no coincidence, honey. I told him the food here was great. A salad for the guy trying to make weight. Apple pie for me, Nik. You see how I covered for you there? - Yeah, well, it's also lying. - Please don't start another fight in here. Salad for you and apple pie. So, Matt. Did you find the guy who robbed you? - What, do you speak French now? - That's German, Dad. - Yeah. - French. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - French. - What the hell are you doing? - What're you doing, huh? What're you doing? - Hap, what's wrong with you? - What're you doing? We got plans, okay? She was gonna work at the UN, she was gonna work at a bank. She's studying. - I understand, Hap. You just want the best for her. - No, you don't understand. The first half of that girl's life, with her mom, was not good. I'm not gonna watch anybody mess up the second half. - Well, what makes you think that I would mess her up? - Why are you even asking if you're not considering it? - I'm just wondering because I wanna know why you feel that way about me. - You're a fighter. - You're a fighter! - Why are we still talking about this? - I don't know! You're the one that's talking about-- - You stay away from her! You stay away from her! - You're a mad man! - You'll find out what a mad man is. It's gonna get a lot worse than that. You've got weight to lose. Come on, one, two, one, two, one, two. - I think I'm light enough. - Few more minutes. - It's been half an hour. - It's been 12 minutes. - But my feet are burning. - Just getting started. - Is this supposed to make me itch? - Rick The Kick Kline, 170 pounds. And now Matt The Doctor Bradford, weighing in at 169. 169 pounds. Ladies and gentlemen, it's an exciting matchup. We'll see you all tomorrow. - I'm gonna mess up that pretty face of yours, bro. All night. I'm gonna pound that thing in all night. - Yeah, yeah, settle down. - You kidding me? - Save it for the fight. - I'll beat all night, old man! I'll take you on, too! - Hello? - Get him out of here! - Hey, Matt, it's Nikki. - How'd you get my number? - My dad and I share a phone plan. Anyways, I just wanted to say I was sorry. I was rude when we spoke. I just know my dad wouldn't do that to anybody. - Hold on. - I'll get a ride with Benny. - Okay. - Okay? You all right? - Yeah. - All right. - Listen, I was wondering, can we meet later? - Sure. - All right, thanks man. Appreciate it, bro. - You're welcome. You what what I always say. - What's that? - I was hoping you knew. - Happy, good of you to stop by. I was just leaving. - What the hell are you doing in my room, man? How'd you get in here? - You know exactly what I'm doing here. Look, you give me my money and I'll give you your belt back. - Forget who I am, Cray? - Don't walk up on me, old man. - Yeah? - I ain't worried about you, pops. Really? - Cray, you ain't doing nothing. - I would move out of the way. No need to get up, old man. - You fucking. - Go to sleep. - I don't think I'm gonna be able to hang out much longer. - Did my dad tell you to stay away from me? - Yeah. - Sometimes I think he's looking out for me just a little too good. - I think you're lucky, someone looking out for you like that. - Believe me, I don't take that for granted. - I know. - What'd he tell you? - No details, just... How it wasn't too good for you with your mom. - She just never was there. From what I've heard, she really went off the deep side after they split up. - Must've really cared about her. - I think it was more about what she could have become when she wouldn't have quit school. Also, about my dad becoming undependable as a fighter. - Well, that explains a lot. I think it's good he stepped in for you. - Well, he kinda had to. Didn't he tell you she killed herself? - No. - If we keep talking about this, will you promise to never tell him? - I wish I could, but if he asks. - Do you always tell the truth? - Yeah. - Always or always-always? - All three. What're you doing? - Changing. Cleaner back here than in the restrooms. - You're gonna get me killed. - Oh by the way, Matthew. While you're telling him the truth, make sure to mention this. - Sorry. You're in bed early. - Gotta get my sleep, we got a big fight tomorrow. - Still early enough. - I got you something. In my bag. - These are great. - Come on, they're shorts. - No, seriously. You didn't have to get me these. - Don't be too happy about it. I've been trying to sell those for two years. - What the hell happened to your eye? - Come on. - Who did that? - Sue. - Sue did that to your eye? - I'm no longer undefeated. Of course, different weight classes, so technically it doesn't count. - Unless, of course, it's unsanctioned. All right. - Happy, you got three minutes. Go get 'em, Doc! - Get your head right, brother. - Hey. - Dad. - Is that any way to say hello, son? - Sorry. - It's okay. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Happy, this is my dad. - Yeah, we met. He wasn't very forthcoming with information, but I found your fight online. Son, we need to talk. - Yeah, well now is obviously not the time to talk. So, you're gonna have to leave. - It's all right, Hap. - You sure? Hey. - Listen to me. I need you to walk away from this right now with me. - We talked about me doing this, Dad. - Matt, I didn't come all this way to talk about the same thing. - Calling your name, brother. - Matt. - Sorry, Dad. - Hey, hey, hey, come on. If he wants to go with you, he'll go. Not like this and not now. - Bye, Dad. You didn't tell me my dad showed up. - You didn't seem like you wanted to talk about that. - I was gonna say thanks. Why is there never a cage? - The old becomes new again. These smokers are catching on, man. - Stay focused. Study him a little while, all right? Okay, have a good fight. - You know this guy's a kicker, right? - Rick, come on, baby. All right. - You stay inside that. He'll throw all combinations. No solo punches. Cut his angles. You understand? - Okay. - Hey! What's Larry doing here? - He owns the place. He owns all of 'em. - Fight! - Combinations! Stop the single punches! Combinations! Stay warm, stay warm. Stay warm. You're no good on the ground, but that guy's worse, okay? You take it to the ground. Just take him to the ground. - Yeah! - Ready. - Fight! - Take him to the ground! Down! - Oh, hi. Take a picture. Thank you. - Oh. Ah, killer, huh? Killer, I got something for you. This is Davey. Davey gonna get us some bitches. Some more bitches. You're too old. Let's go, man. - You're not coming? - I already got enough of a bitch on my hands, remember? - Okay. - Hey, Larry. Lar. Hey. - Hey. - Ah, you're looking good, brother. Looking good. It's been too long. - Yeah. How you doing, Hap? - Never been in better shape. - How is, uh... How's my little girl? How's little Nikki? - Nikki's no little girl anymore. She speaks five languages. She's gonna be working at the UN. - Wow. - How's Anne? - Amber. - Amber. It has been too long, right? Hey. - Hey, Hap. - There he is. You know who Larry Crowley is? - Yeah, of course. He's your manager. - He still is, right? - You managing him? - We just did one fight. - Just helping him out. - Look, uh... Whoever you land with, have him give me a call. Set up a meeting. - Yeah. Thank you so much. I'd love to fight for you, Mr. Crowley. - Good fight tonight. - Hey, Larry, it's good to see you. - Whoa, whoa. That's not who I think it is, right? Get the hell out of here. - I'm gonna hit the head, man. - You ain't even that good. - Nobody can touch Happy McBride! Nobody will! Hit 'em! Get in there! Come on, get in there! Stop messing around, Happy! - Bitch. - So, it's not even that you were that good for me. It's the fact that you did that despite working with Pappy McBride. - Well, he was champ. - Yeah, I'm aware of that. For 15 minutes. And he wasn't much even then. Listen to me. He's a snake, all right? He bites people. He ruins people. That's what he does. He can't escape his nature. So, you call me when he bites you and I will suck that poison out wherever you are. - What are you doing up here? - Oh, I was... I was looking for an exit. Got lost. - Right. One for the road? Look, I would like to make a toast. Look, I know that we've had our rough patches, but. - Come on, you don't have to do that. - Just hear me out, okay? No one's ever done anything like this for me before. Oh, wow. That's strong. I was thinking we keep it going. - You already know the answer to that. - Hap, look. Now that you're training, you're gonna need someone to work with. And if I ever get in your way all you have to do is say so. - I don't need this, okay? If that's why you're up here. - Hap, what are you talking about? I'm the one who needs this. Look, now that I've won, it'll be so much easier for you. Plus, now we have the funds to spread around. Huh? - Sounds a little too much like being a manager. - Jeez. Well, will you think about it? - Yeah, I will. - You okay? - Yeah. Thank you. - He won? - He did. And he got a meeting with Larry. - Well, that means you win too, right? - Well, I'd have to stick with him. - Keep Matt going. Get a dozen more fighters. - Never feels as good as doing it yourself. - I know, but it would be a different kind of good. Helping others. - Sure would. - It would. - What are you trying to say, Knick-Knack? - Nothing. - Thank you. You remind me so much of your mother. - How's that? Why do you think she did it? - Honey, that's a complicated question. - Did she ever talk about it? - No. I mean, we had the same problems other couples did, but. - It's me then. I kept her from living the life she wanted to live. - Honey, I wanted you. If that were the case, she wouldn't let me have you. Right? Come on. Where are you going with this? - You know, it can be passed down. - What? - If nothing caused it, then it must be genetic. - No. - What are you watching? - Nothing. - Did you think about it? - Yeah. Yeah, I did. But I got one question. What was going through your head when you went red on that guy? - What do you think? - Well, something to do with your dad? - Too many somethings. The thing I was thinking about is stupid. - Well, I gotta know. - I had this cat, Pepper, since before I can remember. She was older, 17. So, when I left school we thought it'd be best if my mom looked after her. Wasn't long after that that my dad just put her down. He didn't even call to talk to me about it or anything. He just put her down. I don't know. Maybe it's as much my fault for leaving her there. Maybe I just feel that way because there's so many other times where he just didn't do right by me. He just wasn't there, Hap. Does that answer your question? - Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't the reason I asked, though. I just gotta make sure if you're sleeping here, going red had nothing to do with me. You did good. All right, throw it, throw it. Now, slip it. Slip it. Grab his neck, okay? Lock the hands. Come on. Come on, just like that. All right, pull him down. I want those elbows together. I want those elbows together. You got lots of air here, okay? Tuck your chin. - Hap, how about you show him? - What, does your mama wait for you for dinner? - Sure, whatever. I want to go, yeah. - Go on, go on. Down, okay? Elbows together. Try and get a punch through there. It's not gonna happen. Come on. Elbows. Look. You see that? I got your face. Elbows together. Now, tuck your chin, tuck your chin. Now, watch your head. Where your head goes, your body goes. Where your head goes, your body goes. - Very nice. - Left, right, out to coffee, anywhere I want it. Missing your chance, missing your chance. I'm late. Got that meeting with Larry. - That's today? Is that today? - That's today. One hour, motel. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. All right. Okay. - Wanna mix it up a little bit? - Not really. - You can't fight? - What's wrong, dude? - Why are you always defending him, huh? You know loyalty? It only means something if it's returned. If not, then somebody playing you and you a sucker, hmm? - What are you talking about, man? - You wouldn't even know. I'm gonna tell you this, though. You wouldn't like it. That's for sure. - I don't know about this, Knack. - You look great. - I feel like I kind of look like an old person. - No, distinguished. Just like a manager does. Hey, how's he look, Matthew? - Like a liar. - What the hell does that mean? - I'd like a word with your dad, please. - We don't keep any secrets. - Did you really put a bet on Rick The Kick against me? - Who told you about that? - You need to tell me you didn't do that. - I didn't do that. As your manager, I can't. I had someone else do it. What business is that of yours? - Are you really asking me that right now? - Nikki, you see a problem with this? - Yeah, Nikki. Do you see a problem with this? - Obviously, you didn't know during the fight. - Exactly. How's it hurt you? Did you win? - Yeah, but it's the-- - Yeah, but. I'm the one who got hurt. Lost 2,000 bucks, man. - You bet $2,000? - Yeah. Well, I bet the 30 percent I had on this one plus the money I won in his fight against Cray-Cray. - You bet against me on the other fight as well? - It really doesn't matter. It's all gone now, right? - Oh, well I guess I should be apologizing then. - Actually, as long as you're bringing it up, it would be the gentlemanly thing to do. - I'm not going to this meeting. - You're ridiculous. - Honey, come on. I lost 2,000 bucks. Yeah, go talk to him. Why you're out there, find out how the hell he won. Don't be too nice. That 2,000 bucks was your college money. I'm supposed to believe in him? When does somebody start believing in me? - People see things different all the time. - I'm not allowed to make a couple bucks here? - This is just costing you a lot more than it costs him. - You need to remind him he lived in a van when he met me. - Why do you keep defending him all the time? - Remind him he still does. - It's bullshit. I'm serious. Just over and over. - I'm not going to this meeting, either. - Do you remember what he did for me? - What did he do for you? - You always ask why he stopped fighting. Did you ever think about when he stopped fighting? Once he took me back so he could take care of me? - Yeah. Well, that was also when your mom did what she did. - I know you're still out there. I hear you whispering. - Do you ever wonder how he felt about himself after that? I mean, he's gone gray in just a couple of years, right? You're not the reason he stopped being a fighter. - You better not be talking about anything except me. - Fine. We agree to disagree. I'll be in the van. - He's ready for you. Follow me. - Hey, we're past that, right? Old times. - Mr. Crowley. - Matt. Listen, I don't have a lot of time. I had a couple meetings pushed back. Saw some of your fights, Matt. I like your precision. You know this guy? - Of course. - Sonny Jim Jamison. Middleweight. Top contender. - My middleweight broke his hand. I need someone on my roster to fight him. - When? - Two weeks. - Great. - Boilerplate. Standard provisions for where you are right now. - I'm gonna need a minute to go through this with him. - Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it would all be boilerplate for me at this point. - Give us a minute. - Thank you, Mr. Crowley. - Fellas, can you walk Matt out? Don't start, Hap. You know I give the best deals for these kids starting out. - Larry, I just wanted a minute alone. - All right, I'm listening. - I really appreciate what you're doing here. And I know why you're doing it. So, I've decided on that card, for you, I'm gonna fight again. - Wow, you just can't help yourself, can you, Happy? You're messing with me even now. - No, I'm not. What are you talking about? I mean, I know it seems like that. It's been four or five years, but it's not-- - Eight or nine. - Eight. That's if you're counting. It's eight years of know-how, of training. I'm 30 again. You and I can start this right where we left off. - Where you quit on me? - I didn't quit on you. You brought me a bunch of bums. - That's bullshit and you know it. - No, no. Me and him, two for one. Double card. Where's the old Larry? There he is. That's the guy I remember. - Huh? Come on. - I know what's underneath, brother. - Huh? - You love me and you know it. You love me, you know it. You know you love me. - You've always been a pain in the ass. - Come here, man. This is me. This is me, brother. Come on. Come on. - You're not 30. You're not even 40. - Jesus, look at this. How many people did it take to get that thing in there? - A crew. - How old were those guys? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Stop with the desk. - Just one fight to you, Larry. This is nothing to you. - Every card I put together is special. You know that. - This is special! This is me! - Put the desk down. It's from France. Whoever I get to fight you is not gonna do anything for you. - Any fighter you get has gotta be better than what I got. It's gotta be better than what I got. - I'll see what I can do. - What the hell happened in there? - It's all good. - Hey, Matt. - Hi, Joe. - Hap. - Fancy seeing you here. - Hey, hold up, Joe. Hey, why don't you go celebrate with Owen like it's done. I have always wondered what that meant, fancy seeing you here. - Oh, come on, Hap. It means what it means. It's something you say when you see someone you expect 'em to be here. - It didn't sound like that. Did you expect to see me here? - No. It can also mean surprise. Like when you see someone you know where you don't expect them. - And why would you not expect me to be here? I knew this guy eight years before you met him. - Listen, we got a meeting we gotta get ready for. - No. - You know what, Happy? You're a... Fine. - Do you not remember who I am? Do you not remember who I am? - Fancy seeing you here. - McBride, what do you want, man? - I'll tell you what I want. I want you to say fancy meeting you here like you expected to see me. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Hey, Hap. Fancy to see you here, brother. Happy. Say it. - Fancy seeing you here, Hap. - Not like that. I want feeling. I want you to expect me here, like you're happy to see me. - Fancy seeing you here, Happy. How's that? That's all I got. - One more time. One more time or I'm gonna rock you. - Happy seeing you here, Happy. Nice seeing ya. I'm happy to be here. - Good to see you too, Joe. - Okay. - Good to see you. Did you say hi to Joe? - Hi, Joe. - Hey, fancy seeing you, kid. - Keep in mind who he is every time you see him. We're on the ropes. You had me on the ropes. Hey, Skinny. - Hey. - I feel like I'm not getting any rotation in my hips. - Hit the bag, brother. Yeah, Hap. I know. You're not getting your hips through anymore. That pivot isn't working for you. You need to change levels. Change the way you throw that right hand completely. Put your left out and stick it. Leave it there. Leave it right there, right there. Okay. Now, right here where you would normally throw them. Throw that pivot that right hand around. Yeah? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I want you to drop your hips and let that foot drag and your hips will come all the way through naturally. Just let the foot drag. It's a half a step. Damn, Hap! Happy, glory days. They're coming, baby. Go. You're in it to win it. One more. He's not standing there looking at you. - I feel really good. Who loves you, my brother? Hey, listen. Listen, I gotta hit the head, man. This is making everything move faster. - Well, what about me? I can, uh... Skinny, no? Now? What? Hap. - Do I look like I'm taking calls in here? Team McBride. - Hap, it's Freddy here. How goes it, man? - Hey, Steady Freddy. Never better. How you doing? - Good, good. No, it's all good, man. Hey, listen. I got a fight for your kid. - Ah, really. Against who? - Um, I can get him jack Roberts. What do you say? - Gonna guarantee him more fights with a win? - I'll give you one in a great stadium. - Where is it? - Sunny Tijuana in Baja, Mexico. - You gonna pay for a hotel with that? - Hap, it's a two-hour ride. Why do you need a hotel? - I don't know. You gotta get used to things down there. You gotta get used to breathing that bad air. Gotta get used to fighting wet 'cause you know they throw pee. Gotta get used to the food. You ever see anyone do ground work with diarrhea? How much you paying, man? - 1,500, Hap. What do you say? - Well, it sounds... Well, I think... - Huh? What's going on? I can't hear you, Hap. Hap, I can't hear ya. - You didn't hear me? I said it sounds like, you know. It sounds like I might. - Matt, good luck. Really, Matt. - All right, all right. I get it. - Yeah, good luck, Matt. - That's your answer, huh? - That's my answer. That's also the National Anthem for gringos down there. Come on, Freddy. You gotta come back with a real offer. This kid's on his way up. What do you say? Hello? - So, we got an offer? They'll call, right? - Yeah, yeah. Who cares, you know? I mean, it's now more important what you say no to than yes. - The person we said yes to hasn't called in a couple of weeks. Shouldn't we call him or something? - He'll call. Nobody knows Larry like I know Larry. He will call us. - I'm saying four hours isn't a medical problem, brother. It's a scheduling problem, right? - Hey, Champ. What's up, baby? I heard you're training again. Hey, man. If you want to be the champ, you might need this. What are you gonna do, little man? - No, man. Forget it, Happy. Come on, he's not worth it. Hey, bro, come on. Stop, let me call the cops. - Call the cops? Better call the ambulance. Really, old man? You know what happened last time. - What happened? - You know exactly what happened last time. - What, a sucker punch? - Sucker punch? - Sucker punch. - A sucker punch? Are you serious right now? - This is bullshit. - You really want to fuck with me? - Oh, whoa. I guess he was right about the ambulance. - Guess he forgot who you were, Hap. - I don't blame him. - Hey, man. I don't want any trouble. - See you later. - You might as well pick a fight here. It'd be the only one you see. - What are you saying? - You are not getting that fight. Look at me. You're not getting the fight. - All right, Big Joe. - Do you get it? - I get it. - So, this can't happen for you unless they use him. - Am I crazy or is this as messed up as everyone says it is? - I don't see why this two for one thing is hurting you. - Because I earned the fight. - You earned the fight together. - With him as a manager and me as a fighter. - I'm so sure things are going to work out. Why don't you just wait until they-- - Because the fight's already gone. He's unbelievable. Just like my old man. Just keeps worrying about himself and no one else. - Why do you keep coming back then? - You say that like you already know the answer. - Hey, Dad. Just got off work. - I thought you were Matt. I thought you guys had been out all night on a bender. - Did you eat? - No, I did not. Thank you. I've never been so hungry. - There's something I want to talk to you about. - Me first. Now, I know we've been getting by. That's not good enough. Everything's about to change. - Dad, about that fight you're planning. - What is this? - Matt passed by the diner looking for you last night. He had this. - It was a done deal! - Well, what did you think would happen? - Well, it's gotta be Big Joe. He's been trying to poach Matt since the beginning. - You sure that's what happened? - Of course, what else could it be? I blame that bastard Larry more than I blame anybody. - So, you didn't try to get yourself into the deal? - Matt told you about that? Well, why would that have anything to do with it? - I don't know what that has to do with it. I just know that Matt's upset 'cause he cannot get the chance. And didn't Larry call you in for that, so that Matt would have a shot? - Why is Matt coming to you with all this? - That's not what we're talking about. - Is this guy coming after you? - Where is that coming from? - Is he coming after you? - Dad, I'm 19 years old. You gotta trust me to make my own decisions. - Like your mother made hers? Honey, okay. I'm sorry about that. Stop. - I'm not her and he's not you. Just do the right thing by Matt. - Honey, I'm trying to do the right thing for us! For you and me like always! - Oh, so that's what you've been doing. - What does that mean? What is that about? What the hell does that mean? - Just do the right thing. - Yeah, a message for Larry. Happy McBride. If you don't remember my name, think back to when you built the company on my back. You also might remember all the bribes and everything else I kept my mouth shut about 'cause that's what friends do. And if you feel like calling me back, you should do that as well. - Hey, where are you? - In my van. What's up? - I want to do something about this for both of you. - Mr. Cowley. Mr. Crowley, look who's here. - Ah. - Larry. Hey. - Nikki. - It's been too long. - Yes, you're a big Nikki. Matt. - Mr. Crowley. - Look, I know why you're here. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but the bottom line is there is no demand to see your dad fighting, your manager fighting. It's just business. I don't know what you heard, but I do not take bribes. - These are pre-sold tickets, Mr. Crowley. When I thought that you were gonna give us both a fight, I tweeted. Had people looking for seats before they sold out. So, I had them send me the cash. That's the bottom line, Mr. Crowley. - $2,000 here. A lot of money. - Of course, he's been all over YouTube for like 10 years. - Eight. Okay. You both fight Saturday, but I don't know if you're gonna be on the same card, okay? - Whatever works for you. - Uncle Larry, one more thing. We don't want him to know it happened this way. - He values your friendship so much that it would mean more if-- - Okay, okay. I get it, I get it. All right, I'm a busy man, okay? I gotta go. - See you, Larry. - All right. You gotta go. Maddie! Nikki's leaving! Tell Johnson I'm upstairs! - Uppercut, right hand. Good. You good? - Yeah. - What's up? - Hey, give me just a minute, okay? Matt. Hey, man. - What's up, Hap? - You know, Nikki told me about. - Yeah, I know. - 11th hour. - I get it, Hap. - No, you don't. I wish I had some idea all the time, but I don't get it either. I just know I gotta do this. I gotta do this now. - So, how do we do it? - I'll figure that out. You just need to know I'm sorry, you know, for what you have to-- - Stop, you don't have to do that. It's fine. - All right. - Hey, what are you... What, are you drunk? Get a room. - What? - Uh, I got this. Kitty, what's going on? - No more night left, Champ. - How is that possible? - What little money I had is gone. - When'd you start paying for a room? - You told your fighter, too? What kind of bullshit that? - No, no. That's not what happened. He knows how much I care about you, so I'm sure that he assumed you were just helping me out. Right? - No, that's not what happened. - Jesus. - Take things. You, him, happy time. - I have the money. You have the money. Just give her a couple of days. I'll get you back. - I can't. I don't have it either. - You had $2,000 two weeks ago. - Yeah, and it's gone. - You, him, happy time. Both bullshit. - You know what, Sue? You are bullshit! - No, you're bullshit, Champ. - You're double bullshit, Sue. - You're double bullshit to the roof. - You're bullshit-- - Bullshit. - Fucking infinity. - You go, okay? Take happy time. Go. - Yeah, you know what? Charge me a lost key fee here. I'm not even gonna ask you what you did with that money. I'm not even gonna ask you. - Okay, well. - Now what? I'm not sleeping in a van. I'm not sleeping in a van, dude. - All right. - There's no way I'm sleeping in the goddamn van. - Blender, great blender. Running water. The stove if you wanna whip something up. Fridge, excellent. TV, flat screen. Right. - Yeah? - Happy? - It is. - This is Maddie over at Mr. Crowley's. He'd like to set a meeting. - That sounds great. - So, all bums, huh? - Come on, we both know the truth about that. - And bribes? - I don't know anything. - You should. Seeing as my entire company has been built on your back. - Larry, I'm sorry. - You're a loose cannon. How am I gonna know that you're not gonna... That there's no more surprises? - Larry, I swear to God, I'll do whatever you say. - All right. You fight Saturday. - Really? Just like that? That's great, man. What about Matt? - Happy you'd asked. Matt, uh... Matt fights Saturday, too. - Who'd we draw? - Each other. - Each other? - You versus him. Think about that. - I don't have to think about that. - Aged and experienced versus young and strong. But he's only had one fight. You know what that is? - Confusing? - Yes. No one knows how to set those odds. You know what that is? - Embarrassing. - Big bets. Someone's gonna make a lot of money. - It's ridiculous. Nobody would ever believe that that kid could beat me. - Hap, remember what you just promised me? - Yeah, I do. Yeah. I'm not doing it, though. I can't do that. - Okay. - I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. - Okay. - Not happening. Well, that was hard even for me. - Are you sure you made it happen? - You're damn right I did. - Uh... Uh... Hap, I think there's a mistake. This says I'm fighting you. - No, no, no. That's not a mistake. This is even better than separate fights. - How the hell is this better? - Now, think about it. With separate fights, we could both lose leading us nowhere. We fight each other, one of us has to win, can take care of the other down the line. - What? No. How dare he, Hap. This is crazy. Come on. How do I fight without a manager? - You scored there, too. You got Big Joe. I'll take Benny. We're good. - I get the guy we dissed? - He doesn't care. It's all business to him. He's got a deal with Larry for his fighters, so he fills it with you. - And knowing that, you don't think he had something to do with it? - I'm sure he had everything to do with it. Come on. - And you're still willing to go through with this? - Sign it. - No. There's so much wrong with this. - Look, Matt. I'll carry you, okay? We'll show your best game off. - It's not what I'm talking about. - Integrity. - There's nothing else. - There's everything else. You've only been allowed to have integrity because of the non-integrity stuff that I do. You want an example? Take a good look at your friend Owen rotting away. - I don't believe that. There's gotta be a better way, Hap. - There is no better way. It's the game you chose, man. This is the world we live in. What do you expect me to do against that? - I don't know! - Sign it. - Glad you called. I hope you're not gonna try to talk me into this fighting thing. - It shouldn't matter what I do, Dad. I just... - Matt. - I want you to be happy with-- - Matt, if this fighting thing's not off the table, we don't have anything to talk about. - I don't think it's the fighting that you have a problem with. I mean-- - I'll tell you the thing I have the biggest problem with is you choosing something the furthest thing from a medical career. - Because it was the furthest thing away from something that you wanted, Dad. - Look, we can start over. - I'm not here to figure out the rest of my life with you, Dad. - Stop interrupting me again! Stop it, stop it! - Well, you know what? You're gonna be happy. I came here to tell you that I was going back to school. - Great. We can start over again. - No, we can't. - Sure we can, son. Sure we can. - We'd have to go back 18 years. Say hi to Mom for me. - Oh, I see you're all nestled in. - What are the odds of this, huh? - If it happens, I'd say three to one for you. - With the odds-odds. I mean, what are the odds of you managing me against my own kid? - Oh that. Well. - What do you mean three to one? - Well, they would probably give you more because you know his every move. - It doesn't matter. I win and they won't give me nothing. - No, they would notice. Kid's got heat. Be worse for him no matter how you look at it. - What do you mean worse for him? If he beat me. - If he beat you, he beat some guy that nobody knows. He's no better off. If he loses to you, he lost to some old guy that nobody knows and he's worse than no better off. He can't win for losing, Happy. - You sure got a great way of putting things there, Benny. - Yeah, I call it the way I see it. All right, I gotta get out of here. - Goodnight. - Nikki, wait. - Who do I have to kiss to get a coffee? - Jesus. - You sure about that? - Are you? I'm gonna have to beat up your dad. - That's the spirit. Honey, we have to talk. - Listen, I know how you feel about Matt. - No, Honey. I need to talk to you about what happened to your mom. - You're just saying this so I don't think she passed it down. - No. Now you know she gave up everything for me. You know she lived for me. I hardly even came home. - But that wouldn't have been enough for her to do it. - Jesus, Nikki. You don't remember. I used to come home, she'd be curled up on the couch. She would try to hold herself together. I just... I used it as an excuse to train harder. - But that's why she left. You couldn't have been the one who caused this. - Honey, she only left to get my attention. - I can't remember feeling that she wanted you to follow us. - Honey, she was counting on it. She expected me to fix it. - Why didn't you? - I planned on it. I planned on it. I got a fight and I thought she'll wait for me. She loves me more than anyone. She'll wait for me. Then I got another fight. - I know that you loved her, too. So, why would you do that? - I loved her more than anything I've ever known except you, baby. I swear. - It's not that simple. - Honey, we both know it's not genetic. I know what's up, Joe. You got everything you wanted. - Not everything. Couldn't stop you from fighting. - Larry wouldn't do that to me, not even for you, Joe. - Larry didn't give you this fight. - How the hell am I sitting here? - You know what he's doing. Why even entertain this? - He's the one doing the entertaining. How, Joe? - You're here because of the cash Matt and your kid put up for the seats they lied about selling. Go take a look. Front row, 50 empty seats. - That's impossible. That's impossible. You know... You know Matt, you know that kid. You know he wouldn't lie to save his life, so. - Well, maybe you're growing on him. - Hey, come on. Get out of here, you mongrel. - How much? How much did Matt give Larry? - Not nearly enough for this. $2,000. - Ah, come on. - Son of a. - Happy, Happy, come on. He's just messing with your mind. - I need to see the kid. - Big Joe won't think that's a good idea. - Hey, come on. Hey, Joe. Joe! - What are you doing? You know the other room's off limits. - I just want to talk to Matt. - No, I can't let you in there. You know, what I told you was between us. Did I hurt your feelings? - Go on, get out of here. - Get Larry. - Hey, Matt! - Happy, Happy, come on. - Hap. - I told you to stay away from my daughter! - Ooh, daughter. - I told you to stay away from her! I told you to stay away from my daughter! I wanna know the details, every single thing you did. - Happy, Happy, come on. Come on, Hap. Jesus Christ. - I knew it was your daughter, Happy. She's got your DNA. Sucker! - Stop it! Matt! I told you to stay away from her! - Jesus, what are you doing? - What are you doing? What are you doing? - Happy, no! - I told you to stay away from her. - Hap, ease up, buddy. Happy, ease up. Come on, bud. - Happy, come on. - Hap, Matt. - Knock it off. - Matt, Matt, Matt. Come on, Matt. Off his neck. Easy, easy, easy. - Come on. Goddamn it, what are you thinking? What, did you hurt your hand? Call a doctor. - It's a classic boxer's break. It's what they call an impact induced fracture. - Just can't help yourself, can you, Hap? - Well, he's the one who can't help himself. - Sorry, kid. We all lose. - No, wait a minute. Just put him with somebody else. - It's too late. - You got another guy? - No, he fought mine in the last fight, remember? - My guy's right here. - Oh, Jesus. Wait a minute. The word I hear, that Owen kid's a contender. - He's ready. - He do it? Same terms? - For you? Hell yes. - You good to fight? - I'm fine. - Skinny, go get him. - Come on, Doc. Let's go take care of the paperwork. - Good luck. - You never cease to amaze me, Hap. - You either, Lar. - Now you got a real shot, kid. - You gonna be okay? - Yep. - Don't beat him up any more. - I'll try. So... So, that shot was the point of all this? - Hey, how do you know it wasn't about Nikki, hmm? - I'm pretty sure you would've beaten me up the first time you saw us together. - That's true. - And you haven't exactly told the truth since we've met. - Yeah. Well, you haven't lied since we met either. Except to Larry. - You're not staying? - I gotta get up early and train. - Training with a broken hand? Of course. - Hey, Nik. Your dad's here. - What happened? - Tonight's big story, Happy McBride already had his fight in the locker room with Bradford. And once again, Happy McBride has defeated himself with his temper before taking the first step into the ring. - You know, Bobby. I wish he broke his hand before I had his fight. - Brian, I'm sure 102 other fighters wish that exact same thing. - Do not romance him. You wanna take him home or you wanna take him down? - I had him with one hand. - Good thing you didn't hurt him worse then. - That's funny. That's funny. - Listen to me. Happy never told you that. Happy didn't care. I care about you, Matty. Come on, Matty. That's it, that's love. - Happy should be happy the way The Doctor is operating on Tremaine. - Listen to me. Happy never told you that. Happy didn't care. I care about you, Matty. Come on, Matty. You got the heart. You got the heart Happy never had. You got heart, kid. Trust me. - And Bradford is still all over him. - Tremaine obviously didn't have enough time to prep for this fight, but he's.
