In 1935 Ed Murrow began his career with CBS. When World War II broke out... it was his voice that brought the Battle of Britain home to us... through his "This is London" radio series. He started with us all, many of us here tonight... when television was in its infancy... with the news documentary show, See It Now. He threw stones at giants. Segregation, exploitation of migrant workers... apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover... not the least of which, his historical fight with Senator McCarthy. He is the host of our enormously popular show Person to Person... and tonight he is here with his son, Casey, wife, Janet... and all of you who he's worked with, inspired... lectured and taught. Ladies and gentlemen... the Radio-Television News Directors Association and Foundation... welcomes Mr. Edward R. Murrow. [APPLAUSE] This might just do nobody any good. At the end of this discourse a few people may accuse this reporter... of fouling his own comfortable nest... and your organization may be accused of having given hospitality... to heretical and even dangerous ideas. But the elaborate structure of networks, advertising agencies and sponsors... will not be shaken or altered. It is my desire, if not my duty, to try to talk to you journeymen with some candor... about what is happening to radio and television. And if what I say is responsible... I alone am responsible for the saying of it. Our history will be what we make of it. And if there are any historians about 50 or 100 years from now... and there should be preserved the kinescopes... of one week of all three networks... they will there find, recorded in black and white and in color... evidence of decadence, escapism and insulation... from the realities of the world in which we live. We are currently wealthy, fat, comfortable and complacent. We have a built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information. Our mass media reflect this. But unless we get up off our fat surpluses and recognize that television in the main... is being used to distract, delude, amuse and insulate us... then television and those who finance it... those who look at it and those who work at it... may see a totally different picture too late. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [LAUGHING] Until a year ago... Millie. Millie, just the person I wanted to see. Come here. [SINGING] This needs to go to the top of the Roy Campanella piece. Give me about a half an hour. - No, I need it quicker than that. - Can I get a cup of coffee first? Oh, get me a cup... Morning, Johnny. I have some new notes that go with the Tito footage for Fred. - Fred's not in for about an hour. - I understand. Can you just make sure that he doesn't look at the film... until he reads the notes? Thank you. AARON: Hey, Joe. Shirley. WERSHBA: John. - What's going on here? WERSHBA: What do you mean? Two attractive people alone in the copy room. - Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me. - He'll fire both of us, Shirley. - Rules are made to be broken. - You can afford to say that. [LAUGHING] Let me see this. - It's simply a loyalty oath. - To CBS? And to America. - You promise to be a loyal American? - All of the reporters have signed this. - Are you promising this to CBS? Paley? - Murrow. Murrow signed it. - Murrow signed it? - Yeah. "Are you now or have you ever been"... I thought it was a joke at first, but there's a lot of pressure. - "On the list of subversive groups?" - I don't know. All right, what is it really saying? Is it a civil liberties issue or censorship? - I'm telling CBS that I'm not a Communist. - Murrow signed this? - Yeah. And Fred and Stanton. - Maybe you should talk to Murrow. Maybe I should sign it. If you don't sign this, are you and I a target? If I don't sign it, they'll fire me. Sign it. Finally we can tell everyone the truth. KEEFE [ON TV]: If I could express it in what's in my heart right now... I'd do it in the terms of the poet who once said: Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower I bring to you. Yes, 'tis but a violet, glistening with dew. But still in its heart There lies beauties concealed. So in our heart. Our love for you. Lies unrevealed. You know, I used to... pride myself on the idea that I was a bit... tough. Especially... over the past... 18 or 19 months when we've been... kicked around and bullwhipped and damned. I didn't think that... I could be touched very deeply. FRED: Okay. That's enough. That's enough, Leo. How long is the piece? NATALIE: Four minutes, but we can cut it down. WILLIAMS: It can't stand alone, but it might be a nice companion piece. Let's go through this one more time. Palmer? WILLIAMS: Got a call from the office of Senator Morse this morning... interested in setting up a debate, possibly with Senator Kerr... over Bentsen's comments on last night's show. FRED: Secretary of agriculture. Good idea. Can they do it by this week? No, it would be two weeks at the earliest depending on Morse's schedule. - Still think it's a great idea. FRED: Let's follow up on that. The Hoover-speaks-on-Benjamin-Franklin piece. We're having better luck with Mr. Benjamin Franklin... than we are with Mr. Hoover. It may progress better as a Person to Person. "At home with Ben Franklin." ZOUSMER: We've got the footage, we just need to contact him. See if you can get in touch with him. He wants to do the story. Joe? - Delbert Clark's no longer with us. FRED: New York Times? - Right, our friend at the Times. WILLIAMS: When did that happen? Yesterday morning. They're saying... FRED: How old was he? - 53. Illness, sudden illness. WERSHBA: Home of a friend. FRED: No, it's not an obit piece. Natalie, send some flowers over there from CBS News. Couple things. Case before the Supreme Court... involving the constitutionality of a section of the Internal Security Act. Provides for the deportation of any alien... if he becomes a Communist after entering this country. No takers? McCarthy interrupting his wedding trip... to take charge of the investigation of Communist infiltration... FRED: Natalie, send some flowers. [LAUGHING] SCOTT: May I finish? - It's national security. ZOUSMER: A real ladies' man. SCOTT: Well, they're in love. They're in love. FRED: We have no show for Tuesday, fellas. So get out there and make some news. Rob a bank. Mug an old lady. Do something. AARON: See the Stevens footage? FRED: We will. Watch it to the end. It's worth it. Thank you, John. There's not much there. I can tie it to the Eisenhower-in-the-back-of-the-train piece. You ever spend any time in Detroit, Fred? Not recently. There's a story here in the Detroit News. Dexter, Michigan. Kid named Milo Radulovich. - Italian? - Irish. Air Force kicked him out because his dad read some Serbian newspaper. - His dad a Communist? - I don't know. - Who brought the charges? - Air Force. Charges were in a sealed envelope. - Nobody saw them. - Not even at the hearing? He was declared guilty without a trial and told that to keep his job... he had to denounce his father and his sister. Thank you, Natalie. - His sister? - Yeah. He told them to take a hike. Let's send Joe and Charlie down there, see if he's any good on camera. Is he being brought before the Committee? No. Then it's not McCarthy. Isn't it? Milo Radulovich. WERSHBA [ON TV]: What happens to your children? Yes, if I am being judged on my relatives... if a... Are my children going to be asked to denounce me? Are they going to be judged on what their father was labeled? Are they going to... have to explain to their friends, et cetera... why their father is a security risk? If... If... If the thing is let stand as it... As the first recommendation was sent out by the board... I see a chain reaction that has no end to anybody... for anybody. Well, that's new. You can't call this a neutral piece. The other side's been represented for the last few years. The Air Force hasn't gone on the record. MICKELSON: You'd forego the standards you've stuck to for 15 years? - Both sides, no commentary. - We all editorialize. I'm just identifying what you're both doing. We gave them the information, and asked them to comment. Fred. Hold on, Fred. I've searched my conscience. I can't for the life of me find any justification for this. And I cannot accept that there are, on every story... two equal and logical sides to an argument. Call it editorializing if you'd like. - It is editorializing, Ed. ED: They'll have equal time. Do you know the position you're putting us in? We are all in this together, if the Senate... Do me this favor, Fred, avoid any big speeches... about how we're all in a big boat together, okay? Please don't insult me. I have to go back to Mr. Paley... and Alcoa who sponsors your show... and also happens to have some military contracts... and tell them that they're going to be in a tough bind... because of a beef you had with Joe McCarthy. - We're not going at McCarthy. - You're starting the goddamn fire. Excuse me, Mr. Friendly, there's a Colonel Anderson to see you. - Colonel? - Yeah, he's in your office. FRED: All right. - There's two of them. Maybe they liked the transcript, and wanna compliment us on it. Excuse me. Go after Joe Kennedy. We'll pay for it. ED: I've got a great story about Hoover. You know how many Person to Persons you have to do to make up for this? Judy and her daughter Liza next week. MICKELSON: No. You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin. I'll talk to Mr. Paley. Alcoa won't pay for the ads. And we probably won't either. - But nobody will stop you. - How much are the ads? Three thousand. I'll split it with Fred. He just won't have Christmas presents for his kids this year. - He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that, he loves Christmas. FRED: You did speak with the lawyers? - Yes, we did. And we read the transcript. We've not been allowed to see the footage. Charlie Mack is on a plane right now with the rest of the interviews. - We'll be going right down to the wire. ANDERSON: Your show airs tomorrow. How can we possibly approve and check the story that you are running... in the limited amount of time you have given us? With due respect, you have been invited to participate in this piece, not to approve it. We are going with the story that says that the U.S. Air Force... tried Milo Radulovich without one shred of evidence... and found him guilty of being a security risk without... And you who also have not seen the evidence... are claiming he's not a security risk. Wouldn't you guess... that the people who have seen the contents of that envelope... - Who? - Might have a better idea... of what makes someone a danger to his country? - Or should you decide? FRED: Who, sir? Who are the people? Are they elected? Are they appointed? Do they have an ax to grind? Is it you, sir? Or you, Colonel Jenkins? Do you know the contents of that sealed envelope? Mr. Friendly, we have been a friend and ally... of both Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years. The story you are going to run tomorrow is without merit. So before you take any steps that cannot be undone... I strongly urge you to reconsider your stand. These are very dangerous waters you are attempting to navigate. As a matter of fact, we had no hearing. We have had no day in court. In all the 32 years that I have been a practicing attorney in Detroit... I have never witnessed such a farce and travesty upon justice... as this thing has developed. Eddie, take the first reel. - Tell John I left five seconds extra leader. - Five seconds. I got it. - Palmer. Where's Joe? WILLIAMS: On his way to the control room. We have to do the voice-over live. - Natalie, I need a booth with a live mic. NATALIE: It's already set. We didn't have time to sync it up. HEWITT: That's not what I asked for. It's front-loaded about five seconds. Voice-over's missing on the last piece. Don, there's a commercial in the booth. MACK: Two minutes to air, fellas. HEWITT: Get him out of the booth. Out of the booth. You can't have a mic set up here. Do it in the booth. - Two and a half minutes on the Ed piece. - We've got three minutes on the bottom. HEWITT: Fellas, keep it down. It's a little loud. Two minutes to air, fellas. Charlie, let me borrow your lighter. FRED: Thanks. WILLIAMS: I swapped those pieces... of parents on the end... ZOUSMER: As long as he talks fast. WILLIAMS: He will talk fast. FRED: We got the film. - Will it be ready? FRED: You bet. Funny thing, Freddy. Every time you light a cigarette for me, I know you're lying. You know, it occurs to me we might not get away with this one. - Ten seconds. - You fellas ready? Okay. Ready on camera one. FRED: Five... four, three, two... HEWITT: Pan camera one. Good evening. A few weeks ago there occurred a few obscure notices in the newspaper... about a Lieutenant Milo Radulovich, a lieutenant in the Air Force Reserves. And also something about Air Force regulation 35-dash-62. That is a regulation which states that a man may be regarded as a security risk... if he has close and continuing association with Communists... or people believed to have Communist sympathies. ED [ON TV]: Lieutenant Radulovich was asked to resign in August. He declined. A board was called and heard his case. At the end it was recommended that he be severed from the Air Force... although it was also stated that there was no question whatever... as to the lieutenant's loyalty. We propose to examine insofar as we can the case of Lieutenant Radulovich. Our reporter, Joe Wershba, cameraman, Charlie Mack. JOE [ON TV]: This is the town of Dexter, Michigan. Population: 1500. This statue is at the end of Ann Arbor street... What did the general tell you yesterday? It was a colonel, and there were two of them. - That makes a general. - They weren't too pleased. You're gonna get audited this year. Not me. You. I told them I didn't wanna do the story. - You always were yellow. - Better than red. FRED: In 10 seconds. This is the sister, Margaret Radulovich Fishman. She neither defends nor explains her political activities. MARGARET [ON TV]: I feel that my activities... Well, be they what they may... or my political beliefs, are my own private affair. MILO [ON TV]: Are my children going to be asked to denounce me? Are they going to be judged on what their father was labeled? Are they going to have to explain to their friends, et cetera... why their father is a security risk? Uh, I see absolutely that this is a chain reaction. If the thing is let stand as it... The first recommendation was sent out by the board... I see a chain reaction that has no end to anybody, for anybody. Perhaps you will permit me to read a few sentences just at the end... because I would like to say rather precisely what I mean. We have told the Air Force that we will provide facilities for any comment... or corrections it may wish to make in regard to the case of Milo Radulovich. We are unable to judge the charges against the lieutenant's father or sister... because neither we, nor you, nor they, nor the lawyers, nor the lieutenant... know precisely what was contained in that manila envelope. Was it hearsay, rumor, gossip, slander... or hard ascertainable facts that could be backed by credible witnesses? We do not know. We believe the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father. Even though that iniquity be proved, and in this case it was not. But we believe too... that this case illustrates the need for the Armed Forces... to communicate more fully than they have so far done... the procedures and regulations to be followed... in attempting to protect the national security... and the rights of the individual at the same time. Whatever happens in this whole area... of the relationship between the individual and the state... we will do it ourselves. It cannot be blamed on Malenkov or Mao Tse-tung or even our allies. And it seems to us, that is Fred Friendly and myself... that this is a subject that should be argued about endlessly. Good night, and good luck. And we're out. [SINGING] May I tell you something about yourself... as a member of the Person to Person audience? Based on audience research studies... you are well above average in education and intelligence. Your interests are wide, from world affairs and science... to sports and show business. And you have one characteristic that's rather encouraging to me... and that's the fact that you are not easily persuaded by advertising. Now, the makers of Kent considered all these characteristics... when they chose Mr. Murrow's program to tell you about Kent. Of all leading filter cigarettes Kent filters best. Now, if you'll try Kent with that in mind... I think you'll agree with many other thinking people who have changed to Kent. They find that it makes good sense to smoke Kent... and good smoking too. AARON: Did you get the change on that? No. - You there? Okay. HEWITT: We got it. Not since the silent movies and the idols they produced... has Hollywood witnessed the sort of pilgrimage that is now going on. Each day oblivious to time, weather and the state of the world... sightseers head in the direction of California's San Fernando Valley. For there at the end of the tourist line is Sherman Oaks... and the home Liberace has built for himself and his mother. ED: This is the front, and nobody knows how many people have seen that view. This is the back of the house, and that's Liberace's bedroom. - Good evening, Lee. LIBERACE [ON TV]: Good evening, Ed. - What are you doing? LIBERACE [ON TV]: I'm just dictating... my weekly syndicated newspaper column... and on my trusty tape recorder here... I also am dictating a book. It's an inspirational book. Have you given much thought to getting married... and eventually settling down? LIBERACE [ON TV]: I've given a lot of thought to marriage... but I don't believe in getting married for the sake of it. I want to some day find the perfect mate... and settle down to what I hope will be a marriage that will be blessed by faith... and will be a lasting union. In fact I was reading about lovely young Princess Margaret... and she's looking for her dream man too, and I hope she finds him some day. Uh-huh. Well, Lee, thanks very much for letting us come and visit you. It's been very pleasant. And say good night to the rest of your family for us. LIBERACE [ON TV]: Certainly. - Thanks a lot. LIBERACE [ON TV]: Good night, Ed. - Good night, Lee. Next week we'll take you to Beverly Hills, California... to the house of Mickey Rooney and his new bride. Until then, good night, and good luck. MAN: Good show, Mr. Murrow. NATALIE: Excuse me, Mr. Murrow. When you have a moment... can you take a look at this and sign it for me? And Dr. Stanton wanted you to have a drink with him. - When? - Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar. I can't. What the hell's he doing there? - I believe he's waiting for you. - Well, just call him, Natalie. - Oppenheimer next week. - It's a good show, Ed. - Hey, Don. - Ed. You're getting good at this. They're gonna think you like it. Pays the bills. How are you, Don? It's... day-to-day. Well, if she saw how good you looked right now she'd be back. You tell her that if you see her, will you? - I read the O'Brian piece. - Yeah, it's tough. I'm a pinko. I slant the news. I'm just waiting for him to say my wife left me too. - Nobody worth their salt reads him. - You read him. Well, see, I rest my case. Does Paley read him? - Bill Paley's not gonna do anything, Don. - Well... Thanks, Ed. Oh, I just came by to tell you how great the lieutenant piece was. - Thanks. - How's the fallout? Mostly good, surprisingly. Is this the start? Are you taking sides? It's just a little poke with a stick, see what happens. - You let me know if I can help. - But you're a pinko, Don. I'll see you, Ed. [CHATTERING] SURINE: Joe, what's all this "Radwich" junk you're putting out? Don, I can't talk right now. I gotta get this film to New York. What would you say if I told you Murrow was on the Soviet payroll in 1935? - Uh, Charlie, you wanna...? - Sure. I'll set up outside. WERSHBA: McCarthy going to the Eisenhower dinner? FRED: I have no idea. I don't keep his calendar. Don, ever seen any spy films? You don't just hand me a classified folder. You're supposed to slip it in my briefcase. I didn't know who to give this information to, Paley or Murrow. As you can imagine, Fred and I aren't very friendly. No pun intended. Well, no pun elocuted. - What do you got? - In short? Murrow's been a Communist sympathizer since the 1930s. Member of the International Workers, sponsored trips to Moscow... and on the Soviet payroll in 1935. It's all there. You wanna know why that's not possible? Why you'll lose this one, Donald? Because everyone in this country knows Ed Murrow is a loyal American. He's a patriot. Did you know the word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary? - Can I give this to him? - I'd love it. I have copies. I think you guys go too far. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck... SECRETARY: Yes, Mr. Paley. Right away. Yes, sir. No, he hasn't called. Yes, sir, the second he calls. If you're in a meeting, shall I...? Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Mr. Murrow, Mr. Paley will see you now. Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here. Thank you, Miss Mary. - Hello, Ed. - Bill. Sit over here, will you. - How's Janet? Your son? - All well, thanks. How's Babe? She's fine. She's fine. Her fundraiser got rained on, so... - That's why I never plan on anything. - Really? You'd never know. - Reading fiction? - I hope so. You tell me. - Now we know how they'll come at us. - That's just their first shot. Somebody's going to go down. Have you checked your facts? Are you sure you're on safe ground? - Bill, it's time. Show our cards. - My cards. You lose, what happens? Five guys find themselves out of work. I'm responsible for a hell of a lot more than five goddamn reporters. Let it go. McCarthy will self-destruct, Cohn, all of them. Bill, you said Corporate would not interfere with Editorial and the News... We don't make the news, we report the news. 99 percent of the time he's wrong about the people he's... If he goes too far, the Senate will investigate him and we will report on that. He's wrong all the time when he oversteps civil liberties. You're trying him in the press. Does he get the right to face his accuser? You've just decided on this and now you're presenting it as fact. I write your check. I put you in your country house, and I put your son through school. You should have told me about this before it went so far down the road. Every one of your boys needs to be clean. Do you understand? No ties. If Aaron's mother so much as went to a group fundraiser in 1932, he's out. Hewitt too. Anyone in that room, you make no mistake... I will cut them loose. Corporate won't interfere with Editorial. [PHONE BUZZING] But Editorial will not jeopardize the employees... of the Columbia Broadcasting System. Do I make myself clear? BILL: Yes? FRED: Fellas, our next show is gonna be about Senator McCarthy. And we're gonna go right at him. I don't need to tell you how careful we have to be. If we do this, Ed and I need you to be straight with us. We need to know for the good of the piece... if you have any connection at all... if you subscribed to a newsletter, if you attended a party, anything. Anything that could compromise this, anything at all... because now would be the time to tell us. Ed, I think I should excuse myself. ZOUSMER: Palmer, you kidding? WILLIAMS: My ex was a... I wouldn't say she was a Communist... but she attended meetings. It was before we were married. I didn't even really know about it until after the divorce. But it was different then. We were all on the same side... I'm not telling you anything you don't know. The thing is, somebody will find out. They'll hurt us with it. I should have told you sooner, Ed, I'm sorry. Fred. Oh, if none of us had ever read a dangerous book... or had a friend who was different... or never joined an organization that advocated change... we'd all be just the kind of people Joe McCarthy wants. We're gonna go with the story because the terror is right here in this room. John, Jesse, go through the HUAC hearings. Eddie, Palmer, look at the interviews and any speeches. Okay, fellas, here we go. FRED: His own words, that's what we need. MCCARTHY [ON TV]: Said he wouldn't remove that general from the Army... who cleared a Communist major. I said, "Then..." general, you should be removed from any command. Any man who says: 'I will protect another general who protects Communists'... "is not fit to wear that uniform, general." All right, hold on. Ethically, we're fine. But legally if we air this are we leaking closed-hearing testimony? NATALIE: He chose to read it. SCOTT: We're not misquoting him. There are other reporters. We're safe. - If it's a legal issue, it's his. SCOTT: I'll check with Legal. And wait till you hear the bleeding hearts... scream and cry about our methods... of trying to drag the truth... from those who know or should know... who covered up a Fifth Amendment Communist major. But they say: "Oh, it's all right to uncover them, but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy." [CROWD CHUCKLING ON TV] Did the Civil...? Civil Liberties Union... provide you with an attorney at that time? HARRIS [ON TV]: I had offers of attorneys... one of those was from the American Civil Liberties Union. MCCARTHY: The questions is, did the Civil Liberties Union supply you with an attorney? HARRIS: They did supply an attorney. MCCARTHY: The answer is yes? HARRIS: The answer is yes. You know the Civil Liberties Union has been listed... as a front, doing the work of the Communist Party? HARRIS: Mr. Chairman, this was 1932. MCCARTHY: Yeah, I know it was in 1932. Do you know that they since have been listed... as a front, doing the work of the Communist Party? HARRIS: I do not know that they have been listed. MCCARTHY: You don't know? HARRIS: I've heard that mentioned... All right. Turn it off. ZOUSMER: I need those three cans of Stevenson's tacked onto the end. FRED: Anybody read this book yet? It would be nice if this guy isn't a commie. ZOUSMER: Did Millie give it to you? WILLIAMS: I wanna read it. FRED: Nobody else. JOE: I hear you. FRED: That's it. WERSHBA: I'll put it on a kinescope. FRED: Palmer, cut it at 2:30. ZOUSMER: I prefer it one on each end. I think it would be more powerful. Cut Kennedy? Shorten the piece. FRED: Joe, file it for me. I'll see the Mundt piece later. ED: Are we gonna make it, Fred? FRED: We lost the telecine, but we'll make it. FRED: Did you finish your closing piece? ED: It's Shakespeare. FRED: Write your closing. My argument was, if you show the images of McCarthy it doesn't make any difference. If you agree with him, you'll hate the piece. If you don't, you'll love it. They should wait till they get more footage. I don't think we can take that chance. We've gotta hit McCarthy before he comes after Ed. The blue one. Well, they haven't gone after the Alsops or Herb Block. Well, honey, the Alsops and Herb Block... didn't work for the Institute of International Education in 1934. Then I guess it's time. You worried? I didn't think I was. I don't know why. I was in the office on Friday. I answered the phone, and it was Howard calling from London. And he asked what was going on with McCarthy. And before I answered him... I turned and looked over my shoulder to see who was listening. And who was listening? Chairman Mao. WERSHBA: See you at the office. Hey, your ring. Name me another wife... who reminds her husband to take off his wedding ring before he goes to the office. Ava Gardner. NATALIE: Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow. Mr. Paley's on the line for you. FRED: Maybe he wants to reimburse us for those ads. - You'd like that. FRED: I would like that. - This is Ed. BILL: There's a Knickerbocker game tonight. I've got front-row seats. Are you interested? I'm a little busy bringing down the network tonight, Bill. Is that tonight? We're covered, Bill. BILL [ON PHONE]: All right. I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm with you tomorrow. ED [ON PHONE]: Thanks, Bill. - Ten seconds to promo. - Do you know the timing on that first piece? Can we hold all the calls, please? WILLIAMS: All calls till after the show, thank you. MACK: You fellas awake down there? AARON: Okay. What are we, 20? FRED: Thirty seconds, Ed. FRED: Ten seconds. Five, four... three, two... ZOUSMER: And pan camera one. Because a report on Senator McCarthy is by definition controversial... we want to say exactly what we mean to say... and request your permission to read from a script... whatever remarks Murrow and Friendly may make. If the senator feels that we have done violence to his words or pictures... and desires, so to speak, to answer himself... an opportunity will be afforded him on this program. Our working thesis tonight is this quotation: "If this fight against Communism has made a fight..." between America's two political parties... the American people know one of these parties will be destroyed... "and the republic cannot endure very long as a one-party system." We applaud that statement and we think Senator McCarthy ought to. He said it 17 months ago in Milwaukee. MCCARTHY [ON TV]: The American people realize that this cannot be made a fight... between America's two political parties. If this fight against Communism is made a fight... between America's two political parties... the people know one of those parties will be destroyed... and the republic can't endure very long as a one-party system. On one thing the senator has been consistent. Often operating as a one-man committee... he has traveled far, interviewed many, terrorized some... accused civilian and military leaders of the past administration... of a great conspiracy to turn over the country to Communism. Well, may I say that I was extremely shocked when I heard that... Secretary Stevens told two Army officers that they had to take part in the cover-up... of those who promoted and coddled Communists. As I read his statement I thought of that quotation: "On what meat doth this our Caesar feed?" MCCARTHY [ON TV]: Did the Civil Liberties Union supply you with an attorney? HARRIS [ON TV]: They did. MCCARTHY: The answer is yes? HARRIS: The answer is yes. MCCLELLAN: Do you think this book did considerable harm, its publication... by an expression of the views contained in it? HARRIS [ON TV]: The sale of that book was so abysmally small, it was so unsuccessful... that a question of its influence... You can go to the publisher... you'll see it was one of the most unsuccessful books he ever put out. He's still sorry about it, just as I am. MCCLELLAN: I think that's a compliment to American intelligence. [PEOPLE LAUGHING ON TV] MCCLELLAN: I'll say that. The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates one of the senator's techniques. Twice he said: "The American Civil Liberties Union was listed as a subversive front." The Attorney General's list does not and never has listed the ACLU as subversive... nor does the FBI, or any other federal government agency. And the American Civil Liberties Union holds in its files... letters of commendation from President Truman... President Eisenhower and General MacArthur. Earlier, the senator asked: "Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed?" Had he looked three lines earlier in Shakespeare's Caesar... he would've found this line which is not altogether inappropriate. "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves." No one familiar with the history of this country... can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating... but the line between investigating and persecuting is a fine one... and the junior senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof... and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason... if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine... and remember that we are not descended from fearful men... not from men who feared to write, to associate, to speak... and to defend the causes that were, for the moment, unpopular. This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent... or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history... but we cannot escape responsibility for the results. We proclaim ourselves, indeed as we are... the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world. But we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the junior senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay... amongst our allies abroad and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear, he merely exploited it and rather successfully. Cassius was right, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves." Good night, and good luck. FRED: And we're out. Nothing? Well, maybe nobody watched. WILLIAMS: We got nothing. ZOUSMER: Nothing. MAN 1: Should I turn the phones back on? Yes, I think now would be a good time for that. FRED: Turn the phones on. MAN 2: Mr. Friendly wants the phones on. [PHONES RINGING] It's the junior senator calling collect. Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris thanking us for putting him on the best-seller list. HOLLENBECK [ON TV]: I don't know if you have seen what I saw. But I want to associate myself and this program... with what Ed Murrow has just said. And say I've never been prouder of CBS. HOLLENBECK [ON TV]: Mr. Stevenson had charged that the senator... made demagoguery and deceit... [PHONE RINGING] SCOTT: Congratulations. ZOUSMER: Great show. Feel like a Scotch? I think everybody could use a Scotch. [SINGING] - It's 3:30, early editions are out. - Not worried. No, of course not. Shirley, honey... would you go and get the early editions? - All of them? - Just get O'Brian. [LAUGHING] - Hey, watch my drink. - Yep. SHRILEY: Okay, here we go. ZOUSMER: Here they are. - At last. - The Times. SCOTT: Good. Who wrote it? - Jack Gould. "Edward R. Murrow's television program on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy..." was an exciting and provocative examination of the man and his methods. It was crusading journalism of high responsibility and courage. For TV so often plagued by timidity and hesitation... the program was a milestone that reflected enlightened citizenship. The program... " Hold on. " The program was no less an indictment of those who wish... the problems posed by the senator's tactics would just go and leave them alone. "That was Mr. Murrow's and television's triumph and a very great one." - Yes. - Hear, hear. - He hated it. - Yeah, what's his beef? Send the Times a bottle of Scotch. I did. How do you think we go that review? ZOUSMER: How's the Post? WERSHBA: It's pretty good. - What about O'Brian? SHIRLEY: The same. [LAUGHING] Go on, go on. Read O'Brian. - Uh, I don't have it. - Got it. Here. SHIRLEY: Here we go. - Shirley, that... "We can't say we were surprised..." at Murrow's hate-McCarthy telecast last evening... when his explosively one-sided propaganda... edited with deviously clever selectivity... from McCarthy's march against Communism was finished last evening. By equally Machiavellian coincidence, the following telecast... featured Murrow's PM protégé Hollenbeck. In an obviously gloating mood, Hollenbeck... "hoped viewers had witnessed his patron's triumph from and for the left." And so on. Yeah, so on, so on, so on. HOLLENBECK: It's okay. Go ahead, finish it. - No, that's it. - That's it, that's... - Shirley, please. Finish it. "The Columbia Broadcasting System has been in a lengthy..." clean-house-of-lefties mood. The worst offenders on lesser levels have been pushed out of the company. Don Hollenbeck, a graduate of the demised pinko-publication PM... attacked conservative papers with sly and slanted propaganda. He then proceeded through an equally... tilted review of the day's events with McCarthy... "dominating his words, actions, attitudes..." So on and so on. - It's O'Brian. - Yeah, he didn't get the Scotch, that's all. - Is that grammatically correct? - I'll have that cigarette, Ed. PALMER: Thanks, Shirley. SHIRLEY: Oh. ZOUSMER: Thank you. Joe. Shirley. For the legwork. FRED: It doesn't matter. SHIRLEY: To Jack Gould. FRED: To Jack, to Jack, to Jack Gould. FRED: To Jack Gould. SHIRLEY: I love Jack Gould. AARON: A scholar and gentleman. WILLIAMS: A real writer. SCOTT: May he rest in peace. AARON: What? - Hello, Jimmy. - Fred, congratulations. Thank you. - I got a hangover you wouldn't believe. - All the ad guys on the third floor watched. - Good review in the Times. - Switchboard lit up. We're putting out a release that said calls came in 15-to-1 in favor. - Really? Fifteen-to-1? - We got calls from everywhere. - East Coast or the West Coast? - Yeah, Kansas City, Cincinnati... JIMMY: Mr. Paley. - Morning, Fred. - Morning, Mr. Paley. - How's your wife? - She's fine. Getting ready to move. - Really? Where to? - Riverdale. - We found a nice house there. - It's nice there. Yes, sir. - Excuse me. - Fred. McCarthy wants William Buckley to do his rebuttal. I said no. Yes, sir. Hey. Johnny. Radulovich has been reinstated. AARON: What? - Radulovich... - Radulovich has been reinstated. AARON: Where did you hear this? ZOUSMER: Where's Ed? NATALIE: He's in the bullpen, why? ZOUSMER: Got some good news, got some very good news. Special announcement from the secretary of the Air Force. Fellas. Listen up. Everyone. "I have decided that it is consistent with the interests of the national security..." to retain Lieutenant Radulovich in the United States Air Force. Stop. "He is not, in my opinion, a security risk. Full stop." [CHEERING] ZOUSMER: There you go. Harold E. Talbott, secretary for the Air Force. FRED: Make a copy of that for me? ZOUSMER: Will do, Fred. FRED: Let's get back to work. ZOUSMER: Good job. AARON: This means something. ZOUSMER: Good news, huh? SCOTT: This absolutely means something. ZOUSMER: Absolutely. I mean, this is the start of... FRED: Palmer? The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you. - When? - Tomorrow. FRED: I don't want you to get paranoid, they're talking to everybody. WILLIAMS: Any ideas? FRED: Just tell them what you know. COHN [ON TV]: Is that testimony true? MOSS [ON TV]: No. Not at any time have I been a member of a Communist party... and I have never seen a Communist card. COHN: You've never seen a card? MOSS: Right. COHN: Ever attended any meetings? MOSS: No, I've never attended meetings. COHN: Ever subscribed to the Daily Worker? No, I didn't subscribe to the Daily Worker, and I wouldn't pay for it. MCCARTHY: Uh, well, Mrs. Markward who was working for the FBI... who joined the Communist party under orders from the FBI... has testified that while she never met you personally... at a Communist meeting, that your name was on the list... of Communists who were paying dues. Uh, can you shed any light upon that? MOSS: No, sir, I don't even know what the dues are, or where they were paid. MCCARTHY: Do I understand you have never paid any money... to the Communist party? - Is that correct? - That's right. MCCARTHY: You've never paid any dues to anyone...? FRED: Thank you, Leo. Thank you very much. Good work, Joe. Charlie. Now, what is the show? Is it defending Annie Lee Moss as not being a Communist? Or is it her constitutional rights? We're better sticking up for the constitutional issues. ZOUSMER: The woman is not a Communist spy. FRED: Joe McCarthy said that they have a spy in the Pentagon... that spy has gotten into the code room, and that spy is Annie Lee Moss. New York Times reports, "McCarthy asserts he has new Red-link to Army." Quote, "Senator McCarthy charged today that the Army employs a woman..." "in its code room who was and still may be an active Communist." Unquote. Front page of the New York Times. WERSHBA: No sooner is he done chastising the other committee members... for wanting to push into the afternoon, then what? Seven questions in, he ducks out, leaves his hatchet man. - He leaves. - It's all over the headlines. Eddie, get me copies from any newspaper that printed anything about that. - Absolutely. FRED: The Cincinnati Inquirer. SCOTT: Chicago. All across the country. FRED: Get a stack for the show. Couple other pieces we should include. There's three Annie Lee Mosses in the book. There are two Robert Halls. One's colored, one's white. Charlie said we have some footage of the empty chair. That says it all. SCOTT: That's a great shot. Start with McCarthy leaving after seven questions... and then we'll cut to the shot of the chair. FRED: All right, so to that end... - Excuse me. Fellas. Mr. Murrow, McCarthy wants April sixth. Thank you, Natalie. If Charlie shoots it we see it first. We should ask. Offer. - It's a long shot. - What the hell can McCarthy possibly do? Is he gonna debate himself? We used his words. How can he? We used the original transcripts. Johnny. Johnny, we know what it's going to be. He's going to come after me. There's nothing more he can do. He's gonna bet that a senator trumps a newsman. FRED: He'll lose. - Not if we're playing bridge. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - I'm sorry, guys. Didn't mean to interrupt. FRED: Hey, Don. WERSHBA: It's getting fun now. - Ed, you have a minute? - Yes, Don. I'll be right there. FRED: All right, boys. WERSHBA: Playtime's over. FRED: We have four days... to do a 28-minute show. ED: Sorry. - Oh, that's all right, Ed. HOLLENBECK: Hi, Mary. - Mr. Hollenbeck. Mr. Murrow. - Could you give us a moment, please? - Certainly. HOLLENBECK: Thank you, dear. Thank you. I have to ask you something, Ed. It's about O'Brian. - O'Brian doesn't matter. - He's killing me. - It doesn't amount to a lot. - It's not just him. - Let that guy have it. - We're not going after O'Brian. I will not take on McCarthy and Hearst. I can't defeat them both. Just don't read the papers. Or don't read O'Brian, anyway. Okay. I guess not. I'm sorry, Don. - Although Miss Moss offered to testify... - Senator Mundt, South Dakota. Senator McCarthy suggested that she was too sick. She agreed... Mr. Cohn wanted to know about Mrs. Moss's connection very much with... MCCARTHY [ON TV]: Do you swear to tell the truth... and nothing but the truth so help you God? COHN: May we get your full name for the record, please? Annie Lee Moss. COHN: M-O-S-S? - That's right. MCCARTHY: Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record... and for your information and for the information of your counsel... that you are not here because you are considered important... in the Communist apparatus. We have the testimony that you are a... Have been a Communist. We are rather curious, however, to know that... How you suddenly were shifted from... uh, a worker in a cafeteria to the code room. In other words I am today much more interested... in the handling of your case... by your superiors than in your own personal activities. However, the council will question you about your own activities also. LAYWER: Mr. Chairman? - We will not hear from counsel. You've been told what the rule is. If you have anything to say, say it through your client. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] COHN: Did you begin work at the General Accounting office in 1945? Yes, sir. COHN: And prior to that time had you been a cafeteria worker? - Yes, I had. COHN: I see. Uh, while in the Pentagon since 1950... have you had any connection with coded messages? Have you ever handled coded messages? - No more than to transmit them. COHN: Pardon me? No more than to transmit the message. COHN: Then to transmit them? Did you transmit codes? Receive or to transmit messages was all I had to do. And in the courtroom, I've never been into a courtroom in my life. MCCARTHY: Do you know the, uh, type of classification? Do you know if they were secret, top-secret, confidential? No, sir. MCCARTHY: You wouldn't know the degree of classification? - No, sir. MCCARTHY: I see. I'm afraid I'm going to have to excuse myself. I've got... a rather important appointment tonight which I've got to work on right now... and I wonder if, Senator Mundt, you would take over as chairman. - Mr. Chairman? - Mr. Cohn? I have no further questions of this witness at this time. I can say, we have the testimony of Mrs. Markward... the undercover agent for the FBI... stating that Annie Lee Moss was a member... a dues-paying member of the Communist party. The Northeast Club of the Communist party. We have corroboration of that testimony by another witness who was called... and gave a sworn statement to the effect that she also knew Mrs. Moss... as a member of the Communist party. She's already lost her job, she's been suspended because of this action. I'm not defending her. If she's a Communist, I want her exposed. But to make these statements as, "We've got corroborating evidence... that she is a Communist." Under these circumstances I think she's entitled... to have it produced here in her presence... and let the public know about it and let her know about it. [APPLAUSE] MCCLELLAN: I don't like to try people by hearsay evidence. I like to get the witnesses here and try them... [APPLAUSE] By testimony under oath. MUNDT: The chair will rule... that the comment of Mr. Cohn be stricken from the record. I didn't ask that. I didn't ask that, Mr. Chairman. MUNDT: Whether we should try to produce a witness in public... because the FBI may have her undercover. We don't want to... You can't strike these statements made by counsel here... as to evidence that we are having and withholding. You cannot strike that from the press... nor from the public mind once it's planted there. That's the... That is the, uh, evil of it. Well, I don't think it's fair to a witness... to a citizen of this country, to bring them up here... cross-examine them and when they get through, say: "We've got something, the FBI's got something that condemns you." MUNDT: The chair agrees... - It is not sworn testimony... it's convicting people by rumor and hearsay and innuendo. [APPLAUSE] ED: You will notice that neither Senator McClellan or Senator Symington... nor this reporter, know or claim that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist. Their claim was simply that she had the right to meet her accusers face to face. ED: One month ago tonight, we presented a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. We labeled it as controversial. Most of that report consisted of words and pictures of the senator. At that time we said... if the senator believes we have done violence to his words or pictures... if he desires to speak, to answer himself... an opportunity would be afforded him on this program. The senator sought the opportunity, asked for a delay of three weeks... because he said he was very busy, and he wished adequate time to prepare his reply. We agreed. We placed no restrictions on the manner or method of the presentation of his reply. And we suggested that we would not take time to comment on this particular program. Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, junior senator from Wisconsin. MCCARTHY [ON TV]: Uh, good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow... educational director of the Columbia Broadcasting System... devoted his program to an attack... on the work of the United States Senate investigating committee... and on me personally as its chairman. Now, over the past four years he has made repeated attacks... upon me and those fighting Communists. And, of course, neither Joe McCarthy nor Edward R. Murrow... is of any great importance as individuals. We are only important in our relation to the great struggle... to preserve our American liberties. Now, ordinarily... Ordinarily I would not take time out... from the important work at hand to answer Murrow. However, in this case I feel justified in doing so because Murrow is the symbol... the leader and the cleverest of the jackal pack... which is always found at the throat... of anyone who dares to expose individual Communists and traitors. And I am compelled by the fact... to say to you that Mr. Edward R. Murrow... as far back as 20 years ago... was engaged in propaganda for Communist causes. For example, the Institute of International Education... of which he was the acting director... was chosen to act as a representative by a Soviet agency... to do a job which would normally be done by the Russian Secret Police. Now, Mr. Murrow by his own admission was a member of the IWW... that's the Industrial Workers of the World... a terrorist organization cited as subversive... by an Attorney General of the United States. Now, Mr. Murrow said on this program, and I quote: "The actions of the junior senator from Wisconsin... have given considerable comfort to the enemy." That is the language of our statute of treason, rather strong language. If I am giving comfort to our enemies... I ought not to be in the Senate. If on the other hand Mr. Murrow... is giving comfort to our enemies... he ought not to be brought into the homes... of millions of Americans by the Columbia Broadcasting System. And I want to assure you... that I will not be deterred... by the attacks of the Murrows... the Lattimores, the Fosters... the Daily Worker or the Communist party itself. And I make no claim to leadership. In complete humility... I do ask you and every American... who loves this country... to join with me. MAN [ON TV]: Everyone talks about the weather. Wherever you look on America's modern farms... aluminum is on the job... helping the farmer do something about the weather. Aluminum for the farm is one more example of how Alcoa, since 1888... has continued to pioneer new uses for this vital metal. New uses of aluminum that mean better farms and better farming. The aluminum from the nation's first and leading producer: Alcoa. Aluminum Company of America. Last week Senator McCarthy appeared on this program... to correct any errors he may have thought we made in our report of March ninth. Since he made no reference to any statements of fact that we made... we must conclude that he found no errors of fact. He proved again that anyone who exposes him... anyone who does not share his hysterical disregard for decency and human dignity... and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution... must be either a Communist or a fellow traveler. I fully expected this treatment. The senator added this reporter's name to a long list of individuals and institutions... he has accused of serving the Communist cause. His proposition is very simple: Anyone who criticizes or opposes Senator McCarthy's methods... must be a Communist. And if that be true, there are an awful lot of Communists in this country. For the record let's consider briefly some of the senator's charges. He claimed but offered no proof... that I had been a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. That is false. I was never a member of the IWW, never applied for membership. The senator charged that Professor Harold Laski... a British scholar and politician, dedicated a book to me. That's true. He is dead. He was a socialist, I am not. He was one of those civilized individuals... who did not insist upon agreement with his political principles... as a precondition for conversation or friendship. I do not agree with his political ideas. Laski, as he makes clear in the introduction... dedicated the book to me, not because of political agreement... but because he held my wartime broadcasts from London in high regard. And the dedication so reads. I believed 20 years ago and I believe today... that mature Americans can engage in conversation and controversy... the clash of ideas... with Communists anywhere in the world... without becoming contaminated or converted. I believe that our faith, our conviction... our determination are stronger than theirs... and that we can compete, and successfully... not only in the area of bombs... but in the area of ideas. I have worked with CBS for more than 19 years. The company has subscribed fully to my integrity and responsibility... as a broadcaster and as a loyal American. I require no lectures from the junior senator from Wisconsin... as to the dangers or terrors of Communism. Having searched my conscience and my files... I cannot contend that I have always been right or wise... but I have attempted to pursue the truth with some diligence and to report it... even though, as in this case, I had been warned in advance... that I would be subjected to the attentions of Senator McCarthy. We shall hope to deal with matters of more vital interest to the country next week. Good night, and good luck. "In the last analysis the senator was perched on the television high-dive..." and all prepared to make a resounding splash. He jumped beautifully, but he neglected to check first where he was going to land. It must have been a shock to find that Mr. Murrow... "had drained the water out of the pool." [LAUGHING] - Is that the Times? Gould? - Yeah, it's Jack Gould at the Times. He's a hell of a writer. You should hire him away from the Times. If we can afford him. Senate's investigating McCarthy. What? The Army's charging that McCarthy and Cohn... exercised undue pressure to get preferential treatment for Schine. AARON: I saw Crichton down at the Sun. Second source? No, but it's coming out on the wire in two hours. Who's heading up the investigation? - It's not gonna be McCarthy. - Are you...? Really? - What happened? What's going on? FRED: Call the Post for a second source. The Senate's investigating McCarthy. AARON: There is an added bit of comedy to this story. The committee can't convene for several days... because Senator McCarthy has a case of laryngitis. And he must recover in the desert air of Arizona. [ALL GROANING] ZOUSMER: Oh, how mysterious. AARON: But Stevens is going after him... - and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah. AARON: They'll allow each side to call witnesses... FRED: Great, I'm on that. AARON: And be privy to testimony. WILLIAMS: Hey, Fred, we still have a meeting when I get back. SCOTT: We're gonna go talk to Thompson. No, thanks, Jack. Bye. Well, Freddy, we're a hit. Right up there with Howdy Doody, huh. AARON: Can I have an outside line, please? AARON: Outside line, please. ZOUSMER: Yes, 74, 76... [SINGING] "The fact of newscaster Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday..." does not remove from the record... that peculiar history of the leftist slanting of the news... indulged consistently by the Columbia Broadcasting System. Hollenbeck was what most astute students of CBS's... strange and questionable new methods... considered typical of its newscasters. "By Jack O'Brian." SINGER: Oh, yeah. I like it like that. ED [ON TV]: One of the best programs I ever heard was called CBS Views the Press. A great many people liked it, some didn't... but no one ever called it anything but honest. It was the work of an honest reporter. Don Hollenbeck. He also worked occasionally on See it Now. He did the 11 p.m. news over some of these stations. He had been sick lately and he died this morning. The police said it was suicide. Gas. Not much of an obit. But at least we got our facts straight. And it was brief. And that's all Don Hollenbeck would have asked. Good night, and good luck. WERSHBA: Gotta be in Philadelphia this morning. What time is your train? Eight. - Charlie going with you? - Mm-hm. Here's a thought. What if we're wrong? We're not wrong. We're not gonna look back and... say we protected the wrong side? Protected them from what? In the name of what? What would we be preserving? An argument could be made for the greater good. Not once you give it all away. It's no good then. It's just a thought. WELCH [OVER SPEAKER]: May we not drop this? We know he was in the Lawyers Guild. And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me. I did you, I think, no personal injury, Mr. Cohn. - I meant to do you no personal injury. COHN: No. And if I did, I beg your pardon. Let us not assassinate this lad further, senator. You've done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last have you left no sense of decency? This, I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch. WELCH: Senator, I think it hurts you too, sir. MCCARTHY: I'd like to finish this. WELCH: Have you some private reservation... when you take the oath that you will tell the whole truth... that lets you be the judge of what you will testify to? The answer is there's no reservation about telling the whole truth. Thank you, sir. Then tell us... who delivered... WOMAN: I don't mean... - the documents to you? - This new fashion... is not chic. I think it's just not good for me. Not for you. Milko, anything you care to say on that subject? MILKO: I think, no comment. [CHUCKLING] MILLIE: It's gotta be there. SHIRLEY: If you can't find it, I can't write about it. Check again. MILLIE: Charlie said he dropped it off. SHIRLEY: Charlie said he dropped it... - Shirley, can I see you a minute? - I gotta call you back. MICKELSON: Joe. You too. Close the door. Come in. Have a seat. How are you? - I'm fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah. You both are aware that there's a policy here at CBS... that no two employees can be married. I wanna ask you both a question, but I don't want you to answer it. I want you to just consider it. I know you two are married. Everyone knows. That's not my question. In the next few weeks I have to lay off a couple of people. We're making some significant cuts across the board. I wanted you to know that because you could save someone else being fired. I'm asking you to consider making this decision a little easier. I don't need an answer now. Just... think about it. Okay. - Well, Joe. - Well? - We're sure gonna miss you around here. - Yeah, I'll pack my things. - I think it's for the best. - Well, we'll find out. [CHUCKLING] Mrs. Wershba. Everybody knew. ED: Natalie, did he say what it was about? NATALIE: No, Mr. Murrow. Just that he wanted to talk to you in his office. Uh-oh. The problem isn't simply that you've lost your sponsor. - With Alcoa See It Now still loses money. FRED: Mr. Paley... the fee is $50,000, last week's episode we did for less than $50,000... BILL: You're speaking beyond your competence. We'll find another sponsor. We can find someone who wants... Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Question brings in over 80,000 in sponsors... and it costs one third of what you do. Ed, I've got Tuesday night programming that's number one. People want to enjoy themselves. They don't want a civics lesson. ED: What do you want? - I don't want a constant stomachache... every time you take on a controversial subject. I'm afraid that's the price you have to be willing to pay. Let's walk very carefully through these next few moments. The content of what we're doing is more important... - than what some guy in Cincinnati... - What you're doing, not me. Not Frank Stanton. You. CBS News, See It Now, all belong to you, Bill. You wouldn't know it. What is it you want? Credit? I never censored a single program. I hold on to affiliates who wanted entertainment from us. I fight to keep the license... with the very same politicians that you were bringing down... and I never... never said no to you. Never. I would argue that we have done very well by one another. I would argue that this network... is defined by what the news department has accomplished. And I would also argue that never saying no is not the same as not censoring. Really? You should teach journalism. You and Mr. Friendly. Let me ask you this. Why didn't you correct McCarthy... when he said that Alger Hiss was convicted of treason? He was only convicted of perjury. You corrected everything else. Did you not want the appearance of defending a known Communist? I would argue that everyone censors, including you. What do you want to do, Bill? I'm taking your program from a half an hour to an hour. And it won't be a weekly program, and it won't be Tuesday nights. When would it be? Sunday afternoons. How many episodes? Five. Why don't you just fire me, Bill? I don't think it's what either of us wants. You owe me five shows. ED: You won't like the subject matter. BILL: Probably not. Fred, I'll need you for a moment. FRED: Thank you, Mary. MARY: Goodbye, Mr. Friendly. He wants me to lay a few people off. I'm sure he does. Let's do our first show about the downfall of television. Senate's gonna vote to censure McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably. - And then what happens? - He sits in the back row. - Right. They keep him in the Senate. They don't kick him out. No, he stays. Well, we might as well go down swinging. Did you know the most trusted man in America is Milton Berle? - See? You should have worn a dress. MAN [ON TV]: They're more sophisticated. - How does a Scotch sound? - Scotch sounds good. MAN [ON TV]: Why are we proud? - You know Joe and Shirley are married? - Sure. - Did everyone know? FRED: Pretty much. MAN [ON TV]: We are proud... because from the beginning of this nation... man can walk upright. No matter who he is or who she is. He can walk upright and meet his friend or his enemy. And he does not fear that because that enemy... may be a position in great power... that he... can be suddenly thrown in jail... to rot there without charges and with no recourse to justice. We have the Habeas Corpus Act and we respect it. I began by saying that our history will be what we make it. If we go on as we are... history will take its revenge... and retribution will not limp in catching up with us. Just once in a while let us exalt the importance of ideas and information. Let us dream to the extent of saying that on a given Sunday night... a time normally occupied by Ed Sullivan... is given over to a clinical survey on the state of American education. And a week or two later... a time normally used by Steve Allen... is devoted to a thoroughgoing study of American policy in the Middle East. Would the corporate image of their respective sponsors be damaged? Would the shareholders rise up in their wrath and complain? Would anything happen other than a few million people... would have received some illumination on subjects... that may well determine the future of this country... and therefore the future of the corporations? To those who say, "People won't look, they won't be interested..." they're too complacent, indifferent and insulated"... I can only reply... there is in one reporter's opinion... considerable evidence against that contention. But even if they are right, what have they got to lose? Because if they are right... and this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain, amuse and insulate... then the tube is flickering now... and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost. This instrument can teach. It can illuminate, and, yes, it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent... that humans are determined to use it towards those ends. Otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box. Good night... and good luck.
