THE LAST TRAIN Here and here we can take on water. How will we tell people? I told you. MacFerry and De Le?n will look after the media side of things. In the communique I think we should include an urgent request for a special tax to increase pensions by at least fifty percent. I must remind you that is not on today's agenda. Why a special tax? Can you make ends meet On your pension? My daughter maintains me. What is all this shit? Wouldn't you help your daughter? Please... we have an agenda To keep to. Let's vote on the plan. I vote against. I don't want to be considered a supporter of this illegal act. As the doctor is always wrong, I vote in favour. I don't want any trouble with the police. MacFerry? In favour. Renter?a? Against. In favour. It's a draw so far. My vote is conditional. In the statutes there's no such thing. Then fuck the statutes. Language! I'll expel you... I'll vote in favour if we can persuade Avil?s to take charge of the operation. Leave that to me. It won't come out. It's jammed. It won't come out? OVIEDO TRANSPORT You see? What the hell are you two doing? Did you do your room? Go on, hurry up, get a move on. Why don't you get your things and just piss off? No, the thing is Guito asked me... Hugo, not Guito. Hugo, right... And I need your room. Why did your dad give him the room free? They were friends. Pity about your brother. Those chosen by the gods die young... I bet you didn't say that when you were fifteen. Worthier to die by a fascist's bullet than in one's bed. You're just an old fool. It's you who's old. I'm the same age as my hopes and dreams. Don't tell me, I don't feel like fighting today. Number 33 is waiting for somebody with balls to restore its dignity. Those at the association are all the same. I didn't come to talk about that. I've come to call you to action. You've known me for ages. More's the pity. You know I've always been against acts of violence. Well, have I or haven't I? And, generally speaking, violence paves the way for repression. But there are times in history... That's history with a capital H... when a violent act is the only way out. The only way for decent men to show that they refuse to go on living on their knees. Here. Anyway, in short... what the fuck do you want? I want you to be the knight in this heroic deed. Number 33 is counting on you. Then it's one salami and two sausages. What do you think? No. These two. I'll get MacFerry. RESULTS OF TEST Now, breathing in deeply... And we let our whole body be taken along by the breeze... A gentle breeze swaying the trees and plants... Do you want to see the boys or not? Do tai chi like everyone else. I'm not Chinese. It was your turn yesterday. Today it's mine. Time for the news. ...with Jaime Ferreira Fink, the owner of the engine, which is to have a special destination, right? That's right. In ten days' time it'll set out for Hollywood to be used in a film. That's the reason for the whole thing. Our people have been working on it for the last few days, putting the finishing touches so that it can set out. Was the engine like this before or was it, shall we say, not quite so ready? No, it was just scrap. It was nothing but scrap, so a lot of work with Uruguayan labour had to be done on it, and is still being done. It's taken a month and a half to make it as good as new, as the Americans wanted. How much did you invest? Hello. It's "D-Day." Good. Call everybody. Hurry up. Always the same. Come on! Where are we going? Did you tell your folks? Mum... What did the doctor say? Nothing, nothing... Just a nervous complaint. Blackie! Blackie! - What is it? - Can we come in? - At this time? What for? - To steal the engine. He's always joking... To take some pictures before it goes. That'd put me in a difficult position. There are valuable items. Here, take this. Have a drink on us. I've recorded that you're five minutes late. Record the kick I'm going to give you. Oh, I'm so scared! This is no time for fighting. He's provoking me. - Shall I get the things? - Right. - Yes, yes. - What's that? - You've done it now! - Record it. He's the fireman. You can't bring him along! Why not? Look, 33 isn't a carousel, Pepe. Stoking's not an easy job. Who's going to do it? You? Your hands are used to books. He's only a child. We can't take him. All right. You're not being democratic. You have to go along with the majority. If that absent-minded old fool will stoke coal then Guito stays here. I've got high blood pressure. My Sophia Loren! Who? Madonna, then. My black beauty. I'll take good care of you. Come on, let's get moving. So you're the Professor's nephew. My mother was his sister. - Can I stop a minute? I need... - I'm afraid not, young man. - Just to... - We're late as it is. Have you passed wind? I'm a man in control of his sphincter. Review your troops. Perhaps one of your men... My orifices respond to natural controls. Come on boy, wake up! - Good, my black beauty! - The door! The door! As if it were made of paper! Gave you a fright, eh? Grandma's last jewel is not for sale! Did you see them gaping? Like a dragon was passing. That reminds me of a story by Bradbury. About two mediaeval knights on the way to the Crusades. They see a bright light and hear a terrible noise. "A dragon!" says one, raising his lance. "Aim for the eye!" Says the other, and bravely they both charge at the thing approaching them. And the train knocks the shit out of them. - I don't get it. - Because you're stupid. It's very simple. Did you get it? More or less... You explain, if you're so clever. You wouldn't understand anyway. Stop it! It was a story by Bradbury. - Ray Bradbury! - Ray! About a time tunnel. The knights go from the road onto the railway lines. For me, the main point is that the knights don't hesitate, not for a moment, and they die fighting. We wish to notify the public that the "Friends of the Rails" have decided that locomotive number 33, a jewel in the national crown, be returned to the people of Uruguay. With this our aim, we have decided to take expropriational action which will cease only when the following conditions are met. One... locomotive number 33 shall be declared a national historic monument in order to prevent the purchase by foreign capital of this, the last symbol of the once booming railway network of our small, dear nation. We also demand the government create a special... No, no, no, not that! - Fuck off! Keep filming. - It's not relevant! It's not relevant! Right... that's it. Okay, Guito, pressure's up. My black beauty with the heart of fire! It's not a machine, it's a person. With every sound, she tells you how she feels. And what's that? It's a manner of speaking. Can you hear? She's happy. She's better than ever! - That's phase one complete. - Shit! We forgot the banner. You did. Why bother to write things down? - You write it down then! - I'll stuff that down your throat! - Come on, boys. - Him and his notebook! Unite, brothers. The minutes... Include in the minutes our first victory! - What's the date? - The 22nd. The twenty second of what? - November. - November. Of course. Twenty second of November. Come on, Pepe. - Show me how to drive. - Show everybody. If the old relic dropped dead, we'd be in the shit. Look then. It's really easy, a joy. Once pressure's up, you pull this lever to speed up or slow down. This lever operates the brake. You turn this handle to the left to reverse, and to the right to go forward. It's all very easy but very important. But really... know what you need most of all? Well... Feeling. This is the police station. Would Mr. Jaime Ferreira Fink please get in touch with us urgently? This is Inspector Ponce. - Six-thirty a.m. - Exactly, six-thirty a.m. I should be in bed, not here. Look, I know you're the victim, but I'm in charge. - You're in charge? - Yes, sir. Carlos? This is Jimmy. Sorry it's so early. Really bad, my engine's been stolen. My engine! Yes, you heard right. I couldn't believe it either. I haven't the faintest idea. At the police station with one of your men. Ponce, and he isn't showing much respect. I'll put him on. Here. Thank you. Hello? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, yes. If you'll allow me... I understand, sir. Whatever you say. I'll put him back on. Thanks, Carlos. I'll let you know. I hope everything works out. Say hello to Estela for me. The cameraman works for T.V. So we let him go. But he was an accomplice. - We've got his details. - The recording? Here it is. Thank you. "Arrested for public disturbance..." In the sixties. "Member of the Communist Party..." That's not a crime. Of course not but it gives you a clearer idea. I want to speak to this one alone. I'm sorry a man your age has got himself into such a nasty business. Yet we're both in this for the same reason... Our love of trains, right? But the difference is that I think you can't halt progress. Do you really think some politician will stand up for you? I'm afraid not. Manuel... Can I call you Manuel? Thank you. Manuel, we both know that when the police go out after that engine, anything could happen, right? It could get violent, and nobody wants that, least of all me. So I'm asking you to cooperate with me. Let's work out a solution together. What do you say? You see, I was right. - How are you, my old chum? - I knew you'd do it. Over here. Whenever you like. OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE IS NOT FOR SALE What about the provisions? The provisions? Professor, where did you put the food? That was your job! - Look in your book. - No, not the book. Hell and damnation! I forgot the provisions! Then we won't get very far. At our age, we can go without food. What's the matter with you? Are you blind? What about the boy? - He needs to eat! - So why didn't you bring...? What's your notebook for? All right... - For fuck's... - What's it for? Will you calm down, please? Calm down! We'll have to stop. Stop? Where? If he's hungry he can go. You voted for me to stay, so fuck off! You've got it in for me. I'm sorry. It's just that I... I... I... I... I... I... Hello? Who's there? Hello. Yes. Eight years. Who is this? Article 178, five years for robbery, and Article 306, three years for conspiracy to commit a crime. You've got to catch us first, Mr...? Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy. Are you the police? I'm surprised you've forgotten, Professor. I'm the owner of the locomotive. Tell me what you want. I'm very busy. And what do you want? I want the progressive forces in our country to stop this ignominious sale. Give me a progressive's name and you can ring him and ask him what he's going to do. Listen, Professor. You know this is madness. That's what they said when the Bastille was stormed. This isn't a history lesson, Professor. It's a crime. And you can't win. Then why bother to call me? I don't want any bloodshed. Now you listen to me. If any blood's shed, the press will be very interested. Talking of the press, your nephew's video's pretty bad. You're an educated man. Admit it's all over. I don't know if you realise, young man, that I'm talking to you from an engine that's going at full speed. Listen! And I'm talking to you from a police car that's on the way to arrest you. Cooperate like De Le?n and MacFerry did. - That's a lie! - Me? Professor, tell that gentleman who was born in Oviedo to mind his language. I didn't raise my voice. Professor, give me the engine back and I'll try and sort things out for you. Or I'll leave things to agent Ponce who's with me here. He's the chief of the riot squad and a very efficient man. Know what I mean? You can tell that Ponce that if his men lay a finger on this engine, I'll turn it into scrap! Do you hear? Pepe! - What are you doing? - They got those silly old fools... You should look at yourself. Then it's Plan B. It's Plan Z for me. Are all Asturians like him? - As excessive as him, you mean? - Yes, excessive, extensive... - Mad! For goodness sake! - Guito, come here. You've got good eyesight. Help me look for the battery. - What's up, Pepe? - We have to slow down. The line's fucked. Antonio? Antonio? "Our lov"e "is so vast" "that it n"e"v"e"r" e"nds," "and lif"e "so short" it is not e"nough for our idyll". Ponce. What's he doing? His duty. What's the gun for? He always carries one in cases like this. Remember this is a bunch of old men. I don't think so. You hear of the occasional senile old man with a gun. Last month a pensioner fired a shotgun at us. There's no way I'll risk my men's lives. Did you know that dishonourable discharge means loss of all entitlements, including a pension? Boys, put your guns away. Might scare the old fogeys. Now what are you doing? Look, is this a gang of crazy old men or what? If they are, they'll stop when they see this. And if they don't know how? I don't want my engine damaged. Either we let them through or we try to stop them. My dad was a miner. So for my brother and me, explosives were something we knew all about. How did you use them? That's where the engine came in. We'd go out at night looking for Franco's men. It was my job to drive the engine at full speed. We'd appear, like the dragon in the story the Professor told, remember? I can still hear their bullets on the engine... What did you do? My brother and the militia hid with the fuses lit, and as we went past... Of course, after a time word of our tactics got out, and one night they were waiting for us with an anti-tank gun. The police! The police! What's that on the line, Pepe? Here they come. Brake, brake! Brake, Pepe, brake! Brake, for fuck's sake! Brake! Fuck them! Did you see the boy? - What boy? - The boy! Guito! Come and stoke. - Almost derailed us! - But we're serious. You forgot the boy! That was irresponsible of you, Pepe. But really... full of poetry. As Gandhi would say, "Caught them with their trousers down." You break my balls because I don't bring the kid any food, and you congratulate this madman for almost getting us killed! I feel like getting off now! Pepe, we're going to have to stop. We really are. If the media don't hear about this, there's no point to it. Stop? Have you gone mad? What if the T.V. Cameras had been back there with the police? Everybody would be talking about what we're doing. And that's what we want, isn't it? Let me see... Perhaps there. At this station. - It's isolated. - That's what I mean. - How far is it? - 20 minutes away. Look, the thing with the police car worked out but it might not have. Mind you, they know we're serious now so it'll be harder next time. It's a risk we have to take. Pepe, Guito can't stay here with us. Okay, you're right. Guito can get off whenever you like. And I'll get off with him. Kramer, we could divert them after that bend. - Where is the bend? - There. - And after it? - A siding. Ponce, imagine you get home one day and find thieves inside. Do you set fire to the house? Not a bad idea. We did that once. - Your house? - No, the man who called us. I said your house. A few flames wouldn't do any harm. They'd shit themselves and stop. You've no idea how much an engine costs. - Well, actually... - Yes? I don't. A lot and I don't want it stuck in a siding. Understand? We need to use something you obviously don't have. We're very well equipped, Ferreira. Really? This genetic equipment... even with a brain transplant you'd fail. Put police along the line to stop them taking on water. Find the old men's relatives and the boy's parents. Why so much fuss? And look up "genetic" in the dictionary. Haven't you got anything thicker? No, I've sold out of those, but these are very popular. Don't know if they're any good to me. Trouble with the bladder? I had a prostate operation and I leak a bit now. So two litre bottles of water and did you slice the salami thick? - Yes, sir. - Good. You're okay, you're a journalist. Yes, uncle, but it's a wonder they didn't keep me in. Look, Daniel. Do you want to be a second-rate cameraman the rest of your life? Then this is your chance to make people look at you. Breaks like this one only come along or times in a lifetime. - Yes, but... - I love you, that's why I'm telling you. Stop shitting your pants, you were born with a pair of balls. What do you want me to do? They took the video off you, so go and tell your people what you saw. What you witnessed. - They stole the engine? - Yes. - Where's the video? - Police headquarters, I think. - What do you mean you think? - At police headquarters. Who are you calling? Our contact there, who do you think? I beg you, fellow countrymen... Spread the news. Tell the world that a sepoy from the east, in connivance with the American empire, would deprive us of this thing of beauty. He wants to sell it! Taking it forever beyond our frontiers! I beg you! I beg you! Good news and not so good news. The not so good first. The professor's wife can't be found. So an old lady's too much for your men? Those men have picked the boy's parents up. Yes. I was lucky enough to film the engine being driven away. Montecarlo is the only channel to have had access to the footage. Let's see a preview. This means your job, Ponce. - I'll have you fired. - It wasn't me. - Wasn't you? - I was with you all the time. I'll open an inquiry to see who's responsible. So it wasn't you? I prefer a bent copper to an idiot who can't control his people. Hello? This is Jimmy. Give me Channel Four's number, please. The direct line. Yes... It doesn't matter, Ram?rez. You open the inquiry. How much did you get? You're an idiot, Ram?rez. A scoop like that is worth much more. No... Call and say you got it wrong. First of all... Guito. Then this pain in the neck. And this is mine. Professor. Did you only buy salami? Why? Because I like it. You could have got some fat-free cheese. At our age so much fat is bad. At our age, all's good... The arteries in your head are clogged from all the crap you eat! I prefer that to just eating boiled vegetables. Professor, you know I've got nothing in common with this idiot. But this time, it breaks my heart to say that he's right. This salami is marvellous. It's wonderful. Ah, do what you like! Who am I to lecture you on the connection between a bad diet and heart disease... You'll find out for yourselves. Here. You're from this generation. See if you can work this out. Is that it? Things like that make me feel like a useless old fool. Thanks, kid. Dani, please. Thanks. Dani? Really? Great, Dani. My sister, wherever she is, would be proud of you. Gentlemen. Phase two completed with total and absolute success. Thousands of people just saw this mighty machine break down the doors of its prison. What do they want now? I don't know, but they'll try and board us. They can't. They'd need a bridge for that. We must let Guito off. You know that very well. They're trying to put pressure on. It's leaking. Mr. Secretary, did you buy that sealant? Here. What the hell's this? Glue. But it says it's for false teeth! One of the hardest things to stick. The bastard! He gives me this crap! Give it here. What needs sealing, apart from this argumentative fanatic's mouth? Well? What have you got to say? It was a fluke. But then, that's typical of silly old fools. We're absolutely devastated. We'd always treated Pepe like family. We gave him a room, and look what he did, taking our son, making him steal... I don't really think these people's pain was in the plans of those who took the engine. They're not hardened criminals, just a group of senile old men. They're all on medication. They're mainly a danger to themselves. I ask all Uruguayans of goodwill to cooperate with the authorities, who are doing everything they can. Inspector, what's being done to recover the engine? As long as the boy is on board, our main aim is to try to recover the locomotive without anyone getting hurt. Right, well thank you all. Who's that? My wife. Your wife? Aren't you too old to be married? What do you mean? All the men of your age that I know... are widowers. What about Pepe? He's single. He's much younger than you. And why were you looking at her? Because I like to. I wanted to see a thing of beauty. She's got a nice face. Look, if you don't like her, just tell me so. It's okay. Careful, Guito. Leave Micaela alone or you'll be in trouble. She's not ugly... That's something. Come on then, name a woman you think is beautiful. My mother... Not now, but in pictures before she was married. She looked like a film star. It's true, Prof, what he's saying. When she was 20 years old, she took your breath away. She's less pretty now. It's my dad's fault. Why do you say that? He's always shouting at her, calling her names, nagging at her... There are ups and downs in all marriages. Did you call your wife names? No, it's not my style, although I expect I've hurt her inadvertently. I don't want my mum to go on living like that. She's always crying. Guito, come here. There's nothing to be ashamed of, you know... Know how many people I saw cry in the war? Big men with balls like elephants... When night fell, they remembered their families and cried. And then the next day, they were risking their lives again... Who said men don't cry? Come here. Come and see this. Look. The bastards are emptying the water towers. Now that's just immoral, wasting water with so much drought in the world. When were the police ever moral? Don't overdo it, Pepe. I was just stating a fact. Have we got enough water? We've got enough for two hours flight. - Planes don't take on water. - It was a metaphor, for God's sake. Have you forgotten what "metaphor" means? Metaphor is when I mean "stupid" and I say "Pepe" instead. You must give me the name of the tablets you're taking. Wait, wait. Here. I can't remember the name. Sometimes I forget the simplest things and other times I remember in a flash, like the metaphor thing. I don't know what it means but Finadita used to say it when she taught at home. I don't know. I told you... another fluke. I really got his back up. Look, Pepe, whether by luck or the tablets, the thing is he demolished you. Look, there's a mobile T.V. Unit. The banners! Where are they? Shall I brake or go on? Slow down, but don't stop. There might be some police there. Right! Four... three... Damn it! Fucking hell...! You kidnapped the boy. What? Is he a hostage? I'm a member of the group! Your mother's really upset. Saying we kidnapped him is vile. He's a minor. His parents said you just took him. What do you call that? - You want to know? - Yes. This is a set-up arranged by that sepoy to get rich on the country's heritage. That's what I call it. Do I look like a kidnapper? Look at me! I don't know about that, but... they want the boy back. He's right. We're just common kidnappers. Guito. You have to get off. No, Pepe, don't listen to those fools. This is like in the war, Guito. It's the enemy's final offensive. You see? Like Franco's men they're better equipped and have the advantage. But the train has to go to Brazil. Yes, that's a great idea and I'll bear that in mind, but we shan't be able to do it that way, Guito. You see, it's so easy to stop a train. They stopped my train near Gij?n, you remember I told you that? He who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day, you remember? The Professor said something very important before. We have to win the battle in the press. He's right. That's why you have to get off. The radio and T.V. Stations will be after you like you were a big star. You realize how powerful that makes you? First I'll say that I wasn't kidnapped. Fine, fine. And it's really important you learn our slogan, so that when they interview you you can mention it, slip it into the conversation. It doesn't matter what happens to us now. Even if they stop us the main thing is for you to say everything we couldn't. Now's the time, Pepe. It's been a pleasure. Private Guito, our fate is in your hands. We know you'll win us victory. My friend, off you go, and take care, eh? You too. Look after the old men... I will. First on the scene, Montecarlo has good news for the boy's parents. Nobody kidnapped me. Then why were you on the train? To stoke the boiler. - You could have got burned. - No. I did what all Uruguayans should do. Make the engine stay in Uruguay. How come your men can't find the Professor's wife? In a few minutes... More like 2,000 or 3,000 minutes. With all the fuss over the kid, we can't wait for the water to run out. There's a tunnel there, and it's on a bend. You get the idea? Promise me the locomotive won't be damaged. I'm not an insurance company, but I think we have a "99%" chance of success. And I don't want any martyrs. If anything happens to them I stand to lose a lot more than you. What are you looking for? I've forgotten the name. I can't find it... Whose name? His. I can't remember what he's called. Jos? Avil?s. What do we call him? Pepe. Can you remember my name? Come on, say it. Antonio L?pez, alias "the Professor." You'll have to come along with us, madam. Moraes, you go with N"?"?ez. They're coming. They mustn't see us. - Can we go any faster? - We're at full speed. And there's a bend. Get into position! Fox One and Two ready. Hands up! - This is dynamite. - Drop it! Come on, or we all go up. He's got a 27, he's got a 27! Abort mission! Get rid of that, Pepe. Fucking hell! Get rid of it, you damned fool! - Since you ask so nicely. - Yes... It's a miracle! A miracle! Professor, how could you think I'd bring along real dynamite with Guito on board? If we were at war, I suppose I might. Did you see those cops jump? Look, I'm not Guito so stop talking rubbish. We all know you weren't in any war. I was! You were a babe in arms. If you were a teenager in 1"9"36, you'd be at least 85 years old now. So what? The boy loves listening to my stories. One day, Pepe, you'll have to tell Guito the real hero was your older brother and not you. Out of all fairness to your brother. And Guito doesn't love you just for that. What a bastard you are! A "99%" chance of success! You and your men are a dead loss. And if you weren't so tight-fisted... - What do you mean? - Our intelligence service tells me the insurance covers the engine once aboard ship. Otherwise we could stop it right now. Well they're wrong. The engine's covered here by a foreign company. It's not a question of money, but prospects for the future. Get it? It doesn't look like it. I wouldn't go. With 100"%" efficiency my men are bringing the Professor's wife. Kramer! Are you tired? Where are we? Coming to Chamberlain. The water just held out! My hand's falling off. Mincho's cantina. Look, that's me. The strike of '4"9" A grand strike. They sent battering rams. Poor wretches, we kicked their backsides. Where can we get water here? You know who I am? I'm the Professor. And he's Pepe. I don't know... I'm the Professor, and he's Pepe. What's my name? Dante. Dante Minetti. Don't worry, you're among friends. The Professor, Pepe, and Dante... You're Dante, remember? - Say it, "I'm Dante." - What am I doing here? We were riding with the Professor and the boy, Guito, on the engine, remember? No. I want to go... You want to go? I'm hungry. What would you like? Noodles and pesto. We can manage that. Come on, let's go and have some noodles and pesto. What are we going to do? He should see a doctor. I don't think much can be done. Nothing at all. The same thing happened to my mother. So now what? It's okay, we're here to help. We saw you pass. Thanks. Thanks very much. Can we take on water around here? Of course, come with us. Come with us, please. Right. This is the geriatrics department. Tell them to call his son. - Give me a hand, Prof. - Hey. Still feel like noodles and pesto? Look, you see this gentleman? His wife makes the best pesto for miles around. Yes, she's a great pesto expert. Go with them, eat all the noodles you want, and Pepe and I will come back for you. Come on then. Promise me something. What? If I ever get like that, please push me under a bus. But he's happier than he ever was. Yes, but it's not him any more, Professor. We're the sum of our experiences. Yes, but if all you experience is suffering, what's the point? What's up with you? What are you saying? I see it. Did they take on water? Affirmative. Damn it! We're on our way, notify all units. Professor! Listen to me, you bastard! Antonio, it's me. Micaela? What are you doing with him? I wanted to hear your voice. You didn't tell me about the doctor. I left you a letter, Micaela. About very important things for me... It's you who's important. I don't want to lose you. And I don't want to end up like a vegetable. Professor L?pez. I expect you've heard of the famous - Mayo clinic in America? - So? It specializes in the treatment you need. You could be flying there with your wife tomorrow... Now you listen here. If I wanted an operation I'd go to Montevideo. I don't want any surgeon talking foreign to me. Understand? Science knows no languages, just results. And your wife's already told me she wants you to go where results are guaranteed. Antonio, I'll always be there. I love you, my darling! I love you. When this is all over, I'll kick you into the operating room if necessary. All under control, sir. They won't leave the country. Fine. Divert them. Fucking bastards! What is it? We're going into a siding. You'll have to get off. I'm staying on. You're useless with the brakes. When we've stolen 2 or 3 more, you'll see how useless I am. You're under arrest, in accordance with Articles 178 and 1"9"2, and 306, Section One. Come along with us. Techera, take the lady to the van. Well, did we stop them or not? Your work's not over. Clear the line. The engine goes back to Montevideo. That's your problem. It's Montevideo for the prisoners. Listen, Ponce... Ponce! - Where are you taking them? - Not now! Ladies and gentlemen, it's all over. Please clear the line. The engine's going back to Montevideo, so please clear the line. Will you do that? NUMBER 33 NEVER WENT TO HOLLYWOOD AS THE DELIVERY DATES EXPIRED. JIMMY IS STILL ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALS. THE PROFESSOR NEVER WENT TO JAIL DUE TO HIS DELICATE STATE OF HEALTH. AFTER A HEART OPERATION HE NOW LIVES HAPPILY WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS BOOKS. FOR HEALTH REASONS, CHARGES AGAINST THE SECRETARY WERE ALSO DROPPED. HE WENT BACK TO THE OLD PEOPLE'S HOME, WHERE HE DOES TAI CHI. GUITO'S PARENTS DROPPED ALL CHARGES FOR KIDNAPPING AGAINST JOS? AVIL?S. AFTER SERVING SIX MONTHS, HE WAS RELEASED FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR. HE STILL USES HIS VAN FOR TRANSPORTATION. GUITO'S ONLY DREAM IS TO DRIVE TRAINS.
