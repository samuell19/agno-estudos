"PERFORMANCE IN PROGRESS, NO VISITOR ALLOWED" CAST: VIOLET LAM, KAN YEE-CHING, CHO TAT-WAH, LAI ON-YI, WONG KA-HEI, ANNA NG ALBERT LAW, MEG LAM, TAM KIT-MOEY, OUYANG SHA-FEI, ANNETTE SHAM Excuse me... Urgent matter... Thank you. Excuse me... Happy occasion... Rocky, where are you going? Home. - Excuse me, happy occasion... - Rocky. Charlie, what's up? The moment I see you, I know I'm safe. When you find me, I know bad luck found me. Don't say that. It's my first year anniversary with Mary tonight. Why are you looking for me now? I have to. There's a million-dollar commercial. Hello. The director is throwing a fit. He said the actor is lousy. I thought of you right away. I only need two hours. - How about I give you half a day next week? - No, it has to be now. I can't. I haven't prepared anything tonight. No. I'll get Mildred to help you. Mildred is not my wife. She's yours. How is she going to help? So you put your wife before your best buddy? Charlie, I only have one wife. I have many good friends. Think about it. Hey... Are you helping or not? It's not that I don't want to help. I'm saying next week. Have you forgotten what you said in first grade? What did I say? You said we are brothers. I could go to you if I ever need help. We'll talk about what happened at first grade later. Bye for now. If I'd known you have no loyalty, I wouldn't have helped you beat up Toothless Dog. And you wouldn't be able to play the triangle now. Charlie Wan? Who's Charlie Wan? - Who's Charlie Wan? - It's me... - You're Charlie? - Yes... Thank you. I'm working on it. I got him... I'll be there in five minutes. See you. What did I say in first grade? Loads. Let's go. I'll tell you on the way. - I'll only be there for two hours. - No problem... Action! No matter how well you are groomed, without "Maha", you are still a caveman. No matter how casual you dress, with "Maha", you're irresistible. - So, use "Maha"... - Cut! What the hell is going on here? Tell Rocky, we have to do this over again. - You promised. What am I going to say now? - Charlie. Okay, bye for now. Please fix this. Dude, I've told you again and again. You've to eat the banana peel too. How can one eat the banana peel? The gweilo said eating the peel would make you look more like a caveman. The one telling others to eat the banana peel is the caveman. Tell him to hurry. I'm a person, not a caveman. There's no way I eat the banana peel. What's with the two of you! The gweilo is furious. Get going now. Hey! Are you having a meeting there or what? - Work's done if you eat the banana peel. - It's alright... You get to go home and celebrate your anniversary. What do you say? I will eat the banana peel. Look, if he makes another mistake, I'll have you eat all the NG film, alright? He will make it. Darn you! What's that? Means you're smart. Action! No matter how well you are groomed, without "Maha", you are still a caveman. No matter how casual you dress, with "Maha", you're irresistible. So when men use "Maha", women will be charmed. Maha! Even caveman is charmed. Cut! Hey! Great! You did it. Fantastic. Wonderful! My boy! Well done! Great! Wonderful! You're really great. Let me embrace you, my boy. Darn you... - Darn you... - Put me down... Darn you... Thank you very much. Hey, nice! Hi, Lora. Is my bouquet I ordered yesterday ready? Yes, Robert. It's Rocky. It's the same. Is this for your girlfriend? No, I'm married. It's my first anniversary today. Oh, I remember now. Your wife is... She's Sally, isn't she? It's Mary. The red flowers represent passion. The purple ones, romance. That will do. Here, count it. - I'm going now. Bye-bye. - Bye. Send my regards to your wife, Julie. Okay. Bye-bye... What? Where to get the best wig? I want to know too. Why don't you check the Yellow Pages? Hello, Doctor IQ. Why are you so happy? Have you found out what to do after 19977. No, today is my first anniversary. First anniversary. No wonder you're happy. - After the seventh, you'll be just like me. - Why? You'd rather stare at the TV. Never. My wife and I are very much in love. Bye-bye. Honey, I'm home. Honey Mary, honey... What are we having tonight? "TO MY DEAR COMPANION" Mary is really special. Even her gift is full of creativity. Rocky, what I'm about to say is worse than when I rejected your marriage proposal a year ago. But you are a reasonable man. Marriage doesn't always last. For the past one year of our marriage, I haven't been happy. I don't know if it was you who couldn't make me happy, or me, who doesn't appreciate it. Rocky, I've decided to pursue my happiness. I hope you'd understand there's a limited time to pursue happiness. My lawyer will handle our divorce. We might not be husband and wife. But we can still be friends. Be cool about it. Bye-bye. Mary, I know you were just kidding. I was scared to death. - Happy Anniversary! - Happy Anniversary! What took you so long? Rocky, congratulations. Brother, congratulations. A year went by just like that. You only have decades more to go. Don't worry. - Where's Mary? - Thank you. Where's Mary? She's... She's not at home. Let me put the salad into the fridge. She must be picking a present for you. Women are very picky. When Mary's home, we can open the champagne. Don't wait up. She won't be home ever. Why not? Did Mr. Liew ask me to call him at his home? Thank you. She... She wants a divorce. How did this happen? She said she wasn't happy being with me. Don't be upset. We can still celebrate. Really? Celebrate for what? For regaining your freedom and being a bachelor again. The water tastes like champagne. It's champagne you're drinking. - I think something is wrong with me. - What's wrong? My salad tastes like fruit. This is fruit salad. Here... The pork chop's here. Fresh out of oven. Rocky, this is the best piece. The pork chop looks great. Why do you stand up? I need to go to the bathroom. To eat pork chop? To pee. Do you eat the pork chop while peeing in the toilet? You cracked that joke when he got married. He's divorced and you cracked the same joke. I don't even know why it's funny. I know it's not. But looking at how he is now, I just want to keep it light. Don't you pity Rocky? What's there to pity? He gets to be a bachelor again. He's free! No wonder you don't want to get married. I only have faith in love. See? They got married but are getting a divorce anyway. Something isn't right with Rocky. What is taking him so long? Don't be ridiculous. He is not stupid enough to kill himself. What? Are you alright? He swallowed the whole thing? - No, look. There's one left. - One left. Spit them out! Hurry... - Spit what? - Spit whatever you swallowed. I only had some fruit salad. - Didn't you try to kill yourself? - I thought you were trying to murder me! We thought you were trying to kill yourself. Where's my migraine pill? Gone. My head hurts and I don't get to have a pill. I'm going to bed. It's so unfair. Rocky loves Mary very much. Why did she leave him? That's why I'd never love you too much. Why not? I'm afraid that you might leave me. If I leave you, you'd be really pathetic. I don't have to wait until then. I'm pathetic enough as it is. Why is that? I have three clients to entertain tomorrow. One wants the most beautiful woman. One wants the most beautiful man. The last one wants a dying woman who has money. Where am I going to find these people? The problem is each of them can afford 50,000 dollars. If I can't find them, I'll be really pathetic. Can you switch that off? It's hard for you to treat me nicely with it going off all the time. You are always on the phone or in a meeting. That's why they say women only bother with trivialities. - Jojo, dinner's time. - Only at critical moment, you'd know. What critical moment? Like when you're dying or the house collapsing. So it's impossible to know who really loves you. It's better that way. There's something more important now. Going to the bathroom. Father, good morning. It's George. Call me George. Father George, good morning. Why are you moping? Don't you have to send your wife to work? Not anymore. She wants to divorce me. That's normal. What? Son, men get married because they are horny. Women do so because they are curious. She's no longer curious about you. That's why she left. Why is it so hard to figure women out? - Only one type of men can do that. - Which type? Me. I know women all too well. So I decide to stay single. A bachelor needs a girlfriend too. Not necessarily. Look at me. I'm energized by love. I'm happy and don't stress out about supporting a family. Valentino... Listening to her voice makes me happy. Emmanuelle... George. I am Valentino now. Watch your feet. - What's this? - Just some soup dumplings. This is my brother, Rocky. - Hi. - Your brother? Hello. I made some soup dumplings. Let's eat together. - Here, have some. - Thank you. Go ahead. It doesn't come with tears. What do you mean? I don't have to pay for them. You and your brother look very much alike. Maybe a little. But he's not as gorgeous. Wait up. - Hi, Rocky. - Hi, Anita. How are you? Did you sleep well last night? - Good... - What? Your wife left and you slept well? She's gone to tour around the world. - Really? - Yes. She's touring the world alone at your anniversary? Don't lie to me. Women these days don't like to get stuck in a marriage. Really? I wouldn't know. Of course you don't. If you want a women to fall for you, you have to look handsome. But you're not. Or you have to be rich. Does your family have money? - Not really. - That's it then. What are you doing? Aren't we going to the same floor? It's none of your business his wife left him. These people are so nosy. If they find out about you, the whole building would know. - Tell Sunny she can do the dubbing next week. - Okay. You have to give Foo Eik the quotation soon. Okay, I'll give it to you this afternoon. - Okay. - Charlie. - Hey, are you alright? - I'm fine. Right, are the slides of "Applause From the World" ready? They are all here. You have to see for yourself if you like them. I'll get the projector ready. - Have a seat. - Okay. Right, Rocky, you pick one too. - Pick what? - Girls. I didn't say I want to pick. You can still look at them. That's right. Pictures of babes are always entertaining. - How about her? - Quite good. - This one? - Very good. - This one? - Very good. - This one? - Very, very good. - This one? - Unbelievably good. I say you're unbelievable. What do you want? You're a moron. Do you think you can have them all? You said they are all good. Which suits you best though? One that looks like Mary. Fine. Let's meet at 8:00 p.m. at Sansan Restaurant. - Really? - Yes, it beats you moping in the house. Charlie, listen, I can't go. I have stomachache. I've gone to the toilet over 30 times. I can't even stand straight. I even have to crawl to the phone. Seriously. Enough. I won't change my mind once I've decided. Okay, bye-bye. - Who's that? - Rocky, what's wrong? It's over ♪:00. Why are you still at home? You can't be late on the first date. - No, listen... - What? I... I think I'll be five minutes late. Five minutes, nothing more. Okay, bye-bye. Sir, do you have a reservation? A company of four under Mr. Wan. Take him to table number 28. - This way please. - Thank you. This way please. Sir. That's not my table. I'll sit here. I can watch the performance and listen to the music. I can sing too. It's very convenient here. Thank you. What would you like to drink? Coffee please. I think I'll just have some water. I'm thirsty. Water please. - Give me a glass of orange juice. - Okay. I drop something. What is it? My contact lenses. How about the glasses you're wearing? These are non-prescription lenses. Why do the lenses have circles on them? I mean my contact lenses are non-prescription lenses. These are for nearsightedness. How can I help you? Please stay out of the way. Don't step on my contact lenses. Don't step on my contact lenses. Excuse me. Thank you... Hello, Annette. Hi, Annette, have you been waiting? Only for 10 minutes. Our friend is a great guy. Husband material. I guarantee he doesn't stray. - Are there still guys like that? - Very rarely. But there are still two of them. One's me. Where's the other one? Excuse me. He's here. Hi, Rocky. Rocky, why are you late? Traffic jam. Let me introduce. This is Annette. This is Rocky. Hi. Why is your name Rocky? You don't live up to your name. After watching the movie, I feel like the lead is like me in some way. In what way? Our career path. Do you box? No. What then? Hunting? Battling? Playing mahjong? No, I... Rocky is a percussion musician of the Hong Kong symphony band. He specializes in playing the triangle. Yes. What is your hobby? Nothing much. I take walks, read classics, watch fog at the mountain, enjoy the sunset, listen to classical music, meditate. That's all. - Do you write poems? - Not really. Thank goodness. Right, Rocky might be a bit quiet but he's a great dancer. Rocky, invite her for a dance. Now? Yes, Rocky, go ahead. Okay. May I? She's a lot taller than me. Go! Annette, is this your younger brother? Yes... He's my new boyfriend. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Do you know Alan Tam? Can you move your head? - Can I? - Yes. Thank you. Annette! Annette... Honey, where's my pajamas? It's on the bed. Why didn't you say so? Can't you see it for yourself? Oh please. You might as well massage my neck. Don't play with useless things. You're really selfish. I worked all day at the office for you. Now that you're home, you still want to boss me around. I'm not your wife yet. That's why I'm giving you a chance to perform. If you pass, I'll marry you. Do you think you're the only man in the world? Among all the men you know, who else is as funny and smart as me? - Does it include your look? - No. Aliens. Since when do you know how to crack a joke? I learn from you. Rocky and Annette didn't work out. What should we do? She didn't even let him put his head on her chest. Who would want her? I know who's right for Rocky. - Who? - Miss O. - Miss O? - She's perfect... - Why are you late? - Traffic. What's taking so long? Thank you. This is your seventh drink. Really? I'm thirsty. Let's not wait anymore. No, we made an appointment already. Maybe she's not coming. We are early. - Oh no! - Why? I need to go to the bathroom. Go then. They're not here yet? Let's go. I don't want to wait anymore. Why are you in a hurry to leave? Miss O is very funny. What did you say about me? Miss O, let me introduce you to Rocky. Rocky'? I like you. Your smile is cute. Who? Mildred Wong? Wait. Miss Mildred Wong... Your call. I'm her. Thank you. Rocky, where are we going tonight? - You decide. - Miss O. Hi, 702. Hi, Miss O. Hi, 504. It's really special that your friends' names are numbers. - They are numbers I gave them. - Really? Seven is the length. Two is the number of times. What number should I give you? Whatever. How about K100? Miss O, what are you having? - Nothing for me, Johnny Walker. - Okay. If you're not having a drink, why did you order? Johnny Walker is his number. It's an English name. How is it a number? He's the kind that only passes by the door. What else can I call him? 0007? What? We're waiting for you. Okay then. Bye-bye. - How about this? Okay? - Miss O, Charlie just called and said he couldn't make it. Let's go then. What? I just got here and you're leaving already? Right, you guys go ahead. I better go. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - Mildred. Drink up first. No, I need to go urgently. - Really? - Yes, I must. - Okay, let's go then. - Okay. - Johnny Walker, put it on my tab. - Okay. Can you speed up? You really have to go huh? Yes. Why don't you pull over first? That's not necessary. There's one at the corner. Really? Why are we here? Didn't you say you can't wait until you get home? Aren't you afraid you might run into somebody? You've been here before, haven't you? I'm just worried that you might run into somebody you know. This way. I haven't been here for a long time. I almost forgot the direction. Let me lead. I know this place well. Are you spending the night? Madam, I want... You're here for sex, aren't you? Everyone does. You've to register first. Name, age and ID number please. Are you staying by hour or overnight? No, I don't need that long. I'll be quick. I don't care how quick you are. You're staying for at least two hours. May I know where the toilet is? It's in the room. Which room? The one you rent. You know the way. I haven't been to a place like this. I don't mean you. I mean the girl you're with. Register now. - I need the room with sunbathing. - Sure. Sunbathing? I only need to go to the toilet. You rent the room. Use it however you want. I just need the toilet. Even so, I'll have to charge you. That would be 160 dollars. Keep the change. - Thank you. Mr. Danny. - You're welcome. Isn't your name Rocky? Whatever. I need to change my name anyway. - Follow me. - Hurry please. - This is the room. - Thank you. Hi. Your peeing reminds me of my first lover. Seriously? He was 6 and I was 4. But the noise of your pee is the same. The flow was consistent and rhythmic. Sometimes, it felt like a full force of water. Sometimes, it felt like a gentle stream. Rocky. I want to leave. Excuse me. I want to take a shower. I sweated a lot and I stink. No, I love your most authentic scent. To tell you the truth, my first time was in a stable. You're not getting away tonight. Let me go, please. You're so light. Really? From now on, you are not leaving the bed. I didn't know I didn't know things happen so quickly between us. I didn't expect before I died, I could make such passionate love. I am going to screw your brains out. That's right. Do what I do. It doesn't matter, as long as it gets you excited. When we climax, strangle me hard. And I... I will strangle you. What? Imagine it. At that moment, when we are so passionate, that we become one, we strangle one another. We will be together forever, dead or alive. When others find us, what they see is not two corpses, but a pair of perfect statues. We can name us, "Love-making". No, it should be... Love! The only downfall is our eyes might be bulging and our tongue sticking out. But it doesn't matter. They can gouge them out and throw them away. What's left is faces that are completely blue. I think you better take that shower. Didn't you like my authentic scent? Sometimes, I like the soapy scent too. Good, but remember. You're not getting away tonight. Mama Mia... How is it? Any luck? No. You can't pick up a fish even if you catch it. Don't mock me. I'm your son. I'm seriously doubting that. If it were me last night, things would be different. I'm a human, not an animal. Even an animal knows how to do it. What was wrong with my decision last night? All men will agree you did wrong. Fine... If I ever come across opportunity like this next time, I'll bring you along. Next time, I will do it myself. It's bad to drink beer so early in the day, Father. Your mother said so for decades. She drank milk for ages, while I drank beer for ages. She died before me. Where's your lover? I don't want to talk about it. You broke up? She said she wanted to get married last night. Did you say yes? I've been free since your mother died. Why would I get tied up again? I'm not going to do that. Wooing a woman is like fishing. The most fun part is when you get her. After you get her, - even if she goes away, it's fine. - What if she leaves for good? Another one will come along. There are so much fish in the ocean. Even if you don't drop the bait, she'd find you anyway. Valentino! My big red grouper is coming this way. You two seems to be having a lot of fun. Go to a salon with me. It's boring going to the salon. Let's watch a movie. You can go fishing. We're off to a movie. Why don't you come to a salon with me? I need to get my hair washed. Sure, but my brother was there. Let's go to a salon now and dine out later. I don't like to dine out. I want to go home to make meatballs. Meatballs? Sure... Meatballs... - Remember, don't mention Mary. - Got it! Especially not to that gossipmonger. - Got it! - Why? If she finds out, all classmates will find out within 10 seconds. Don't be ridiculous. I'm really nervous. - She was even prettier the last time. - I'm jealous. Hi, Rocky. Handle her for me. Hi, Suzy, long time. You're getting prettier. Really? You're sweet. Rocky, where's Mary? She went to the States. Really? How come I am not aware? - Do you work in the US embassy? - No. Then, why would you know? Rocky, why did Mary go to the States? To visit her parents. - We're going to the other side. Come, bye. - Okay, bye-bye. Do you know? Rocky and Mary fought - and Mary went to the States. - Really? - Yes. - Oh dear! How could she said that about you? I feel bad for you. Have a drink. You were right about her. Mildred, Rocky, how are you? Hello, Paula, where are your twin daughters? They are over there. Let me bring you to them. Long time no see. - Hi, Linda. - Mildred, where's Charlie? - He's outside. - See you later. Hello. Hi, Amy, your baby is lovely. Come and greet Auntie. - Auntie. - Hello, you two. Give me a kiss. Your twins are beautiful. - Rocky, where's your wife? - She went home. - Rocky, where's Mary? - She went to the States. - Rocky, where's your wife? - She went home. - Rocky, where's your wife? - She went to the States. Really? - Rocky, where's your wife? - She went home. - Rocky, where's your wife? - She went to the States. - Rocky, where's your wife? - She went home. She went home to the States! Uncle, you're sitting on my hanky. I didn't know. Here. The hanky is to flag the seat as mine. This is my seat. There's no other stool. Let's share the seat. Okay? Where's your wife? I'm not married yet. You're old. How come you're not married? Because I don't like women. Are you gay? You're smart... Uncle, I'm not gay. Mary, aren't you in the States? No, I'm writing a book. - What book? - Let me see. This is my boyfriend, Romeo. That's not Rocky. No, really? Impossible. Look. He said she went to the States. I say they're splitting up. Rocky lied. Right, he's embarrassed. Hi, Rocky. Hi, hope you like the book. No problem... Hope you like the book. - Have a look. - Hope you like the book. That's true. - Hope you like the book. - Hi, show me. Have a look. The secret of a married man behind closed door. Does this work? Interesting. It looks interesting. It is. Do you want to read? Have a look. No thanks. - Look. - Is it interesting? Yes. My turn. - Do you know where Rocky is? - No. Where is he? "A Sentimental Man - The Secret of A Married Man Behind Closed Door." What a stupid book! Father, good morning. Morning? Do you know the book about you has made over 1,000 sales. There's nothing I can do. Let me figure this out for you. Do you know what it's about? What? She said during the one year, she hadn't enjoyed the sex, not even once. I don't know if you were bad in bed or she was asking too much. I'm not angry. Why are you? I wasn't, until I saw she said it was genetic. Is it genetic? Do you think you're a test tube baby? There was no such thing back then. If I didn't make it, you wouldn't have existed. Isn't that good enough? But people don't believe it. Everybody knows now. How am I supposed to go fishing? Fishing? When they know you can't get it up, how will they trust that you'll get the job done? Isn't it enough that we know we can get it up, Father? No, sue her. For what? For libel. Charlie, hurry, don't be late. Honey, I don't want to go. Why not? Rocky thought you'd be there. I've lots of work. I can't spare the time. You're his only good friend. Everybody at the court is there to laugh at him. Why can't you spare half a day to be there for him? What can I do there? At least we can support him emotionally. Support is very abstract. I can support him while I attend a meeting afar. He will feel it. Save it. Honey, let's have lunch later. Can you do that from afar? On February 14, 1983, on your first night together, your ex-wife asked if you were a virgin. Did you say yes? Did you? Yes. How old were you when you got married? 30 years old. A 30 year-old virgin. You must have certain hereditary abnormality. Objection, Your Honor. The question is unrelated to the case. Sustained! Did you masturbate before you got married? This is ridiculous. Why would she ask something like that? This is too much. - Silence. - Did you? No. Do you undertake other ways to satisfy your sexual needs? No. Do you mean you don't have sexual needs? Not true, but there's nothing I could do. How do you feel when you look at this picture? - Are you excited? - No. - No? - No. - That's an abnormality then? - No, it's just that I don't like this woman. According to research, your wife initiate sex 365 times, but you only accepted 12. Is that right? I don't remember. The reasons you didn't respond include for fear of waking others, 13 times; In deep sleep, 40 times; Hurricane signal number 10, twice; Overeating, 19 times; Movie ending, 18 times; Having people everywhere, 23 times; Too cold, 17 times; Too early, 30 times; Just finished showering, three times. Even the 12 times you accepted were less than ideal. That's why your ex-wife thinks you failed to be a responsible husband. Objection, Your Honor. Silence... Objection, Your Honor. How can she say that to my client? - Don't go. Calm down! - Rocky! Son... He's your son. Why did you say he was your brother? What else have you lied to me about? I look young and he looks old. If I said he was my son, you wouldn't believe. You're dishonest. I don't want to be friends with you anymore. - Let's go. - Come... Rocky! Rocky! Wait for me. Rocky, say something. - You'll feel better after you let it out. - 1... You're a good man. You can get through this. I'm not. You saw how people laughed at me. You should know by then. I can't make it. I'm short, portly and timid. I'm not smart. My nearsightedness is serious. I can perform in front of thousands of people but I can't make love to a stranger. But you're a great friend and a principled man. You're honest, caring, funny and romantic. What you described is my twin brother. He's dead for a long time. No, it's you. Not many people have your qualities. Not many people appreciate it though. At the very least, Mary doesn't. Actually, we all think in different ways. Am I right? Come on, let's have lunch with Charlie. What would you like to have? You decide. Do you want Japanese or Vietnamese food? Anita, why do you eat alone? Have lunch with us. You should have said so. Lovesick guy, why are you taking me to lunch? What are you up to? He's not buying. Charlie told us to go for lunch together. Forget it. Right, where's Charlie? He was gone when the clock hit 12:00. Is he really having lunch with you? You know how you hubby is like. Never mind. We can have lunch ourselves. Anita, do you want to come? You want me to come? Alright. Let's go. Let's go. Honey. Hello, Jojo. Honey, pack my luggage. I have to go to Taiwan tomorrow. - Right, how was it with Rocky today? - We had lunch. It's all Simon's fault. He had to drag me along to see our Taiwan clients. That's why I have to go to Taiwan tomorrow to sign a contract. You're always on the phone or in a meeting. I could hardly see you when you're in Hong Kong. Now, you've to take care of Taiwan side as well? You really have to send some support from afar to me. I can't said no to business, can I? Business is all you care about. You don't care about me. Do you think you're Jojo? Do you need me to feed you? Do you understand what women want? Sure I do. Women want affection, love, et cetera. Love needs romance to go hand in hand. Romance requires the right ambience. The right ambience requires money. That's why I work hard to make money. Am I right, Jojo? Or else, you won't have fresh milk and beef. Enough. I have to take a shower. My flight is really early tomorrow. Remember to set the alarm. Charlie, how long is your trip? Two, three days, possibly five to seven days. So you don't know how long it'd take. I want to establish more connections. If it goes well, the company can expand. Do you get it? Charlie, we haven't traveled for a long time. When you come back, let's go to Hawaii. Sure. Really? I'll book the air tickets. When you come back, we can leave right away. Sure. Let's ask Anita's sister to find us cheaper tickets. The cheaper the better. Europe is very expensive. Europe? We'll go to Europe like you say. See how nice I'm treating you? Remember to call Curry and ask him to pay up. He hasn't made payment for over two months. Dog! Watch out! Cars! Hello? - Charlie? - Come to the hospital now. Thank you. But don't introduce me to a nurse. I don't like them. No, Mildred just had an accident. She's in a hospital. I need to go to Taiwan now. Can you come here and take care of her for me? I can't talk anymore. I've to go to the airport now. Bye-bye. How's Mildred? Which hospital? Hospital... Excuse me. Mildred, are you alright? I'm fine. I just hurt my arms. Right, where's Charlie? Is he gone? Did he say when he's coming back? Don't worry. I know all about admitting to a hospital. Mary used to get admitted. Towel, toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, toilet paper. I've brought everything. The toilet paper here is really rough. It's impossible to use. With some flowers, the patient won't feel so down. You must avoid certain food. If you're thirsty, remember to drink isotonic drink, or eat some fruit. I will leave them on the fridge. There are magazines and a radio. If your eyes are tired, don't read the magazine. Listen to the radio. It'd make you sleep better. It's a pity I don't have time to make soup today. So I bought one off the shelf. Incidentally, it's peanut with pork trotter soup. It's the most tonic for arm injury. But the bad thing about soup off the shelf is that it's very oily. It's bad for your stomach. So you must remove the oily layer at the top before you drink. Okay? Let me see if it's alright. You can drink it now. Here. I forgot you hurt your arms. Let me feed you. Here. Isn't my arm injury enough to make him cancel his trip to Taiwan? He said at critical moment, I'd know. Know what? Know how much he loves me. I know it now. Even if my arms are broken, he would leave me behind. Fine, I'll go to Taiwan and look for him. The plane has left. Well... I'll take the next flight. I'll take the next flight. - Do you have the visa to Taiwan? - No. Don't cry. Don't cry. Stop wiping. I'm not crying anymore. But I am. Why are you crying? Why can't I cry? Charlie has gone to Taiwan, and you cry because of that. Mary left me. Why can't I cry? But my arms are hurt. My heart is hurt too. You can get a cast on your arms. But I can't get any bandage on my heart. Rocky, don't cry. Don't bother about me. Let me cry away. If we let you cry away, the hospital building will collapse. You're a man. Stop crying! "LOVE, CHARLIE" "REMEMBER TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE" "WISHING YOU A SPEEDY RECOVERY" Father, you're early. Early? It's already 9:30. Really? Why is the newspaper late today? The milk was on the sofa and the newspaper was in the fridge. You're either in love or being dumped. But you don't look like you're dumped. Where are you going? Mildred is discharged from the hospital at 10:00. I've to go and fetch her. What does that have to do with you? Charlie went to Taiwan. You know you'll be late but you dress up anyway. The person you're seeing is either your love rival or your lover. I didn't want to go, Mildred. Listen to me. It's all Simon's fault. He wants me... You say you'll be back tomorrow. But tomorrow, you'll postpone again. Come back whenever you like. Why even bother to tell me? Come in. - Luckily, I'm early, or the bouquet's wasted. - Thank you. Come in... Come in... This is my best friend, Mildred. This is Mandel Hong. Hello, how are you? Why are you following me? Go have a seat. Is he your boyfriend? He's my fiance. Are you getting married? Yes, I'm 30 years old already. I don't have much option. I'll go with whoever treats me well. Whether he's good-looking or not, it'd be the same a decade later. Congratulations. If you find a good man, be sure to hold on to him. How about you and Charlie? I don't want to talk about it. Mildred. - Hi, Anita. - It's been a while. You look sharp. I've to go. I need to shop for a bed. - Okay. - Are you getting married? Yes, that's my fiance, Mandel Hong. Come over. Hurry. This is Rocky. Hi, how are you? Hi, how are you? Congratulations. - Thank you... - You're welcome. Stop shaking hands already. We don't have time for shopping. Let's go. - Let's get together some time. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye... - Let's go. - Bye-bye, Sweetie. - Bye-bye. - Have you packed? - Yes. - Let me get it. - Thank you. - Make sure you pack everything. - I have. Let's go. I'm sorry for keeping you at this hour. I don't know what to do at home alone. Me too. I don't want to go home early either. Do you feel bored? Now? No, I mean in general. I never felt bored when I was with Mary. After she left, I started to feel bored. But lately, I don't anymore. - Are you bored with me? - No. Do you sing? I can only sing Cantonese opera. - Come, sing for me. - It's bad though. - Go ahead. - No. - Go ahead... - You won't laugh? "A light gondola glides." "One is miles away... ." Stop howling! - I'm so sorry. - Go sing in the mountains! That man was really fierce. Can't blame him. It's the middle of the night after all. Are you hurt? No. It was just a banana peel. If he threw something hard, my skull would be broken. Then, I'll take care of you then. It's late. You should go. You go in first. I'll go in after you leave. You go in first, then I'll leave. Okay, I better go. It's late. Okay, thanks for tonight. Crazy man! How do you know? I'm really crazy... Congratulations, Uncle, congratulations. Mildred, I'm so happy "I'M COMING" What is love? Love is like a glass of coke. If you pour it too quickly, the whole glass is filled with foam. Once the foam subsides, you find the glass is only half full. Are we pouring too quickly? What do you think? Not really. We've known each other for years. But I don't know why I just found out how much we click. A lot of times, we don't notice what's in front of us. I don't believe that. At least in Hong Kong, everybody knows this is Star Ferry Pier. Excuse me, where is Star Ferry Pier? It's right there. Thank you. There really is someone who doesn't know where Star Ferry Pier is. How crazy! What is it? Why are you so energized? Nah, I just want to be fitter. You've been with Mildred a lot, haven't you? How do you know? I am your father after all. The thing is she's my friend's girl. Are they married? Not yet. It's fine then. You're a man. Do what you want. Love whom you want. If you don't cherish her, you will regret it. Have you been regretting? I'm not. Just taking a break. To avoid the red grouper? I don't want my cholesterol to be overshot. I'm going now. Where to? Are you really my father? You forget it's my birthday today. Of course I remember your birthday. Or else, why would I tell you to cherish Mildred? You win. I'm going now. Bye-bye. Is today his birthday? I thought it's July 14th. How come there's no cake? I don't know how to bake. How do I make a wish then? You can wish upon a piece of braised beef. - Nobody does that. - Sure they do. - Done. - Can you tell me what you wish for? Sure, I wish my next birthday, you would put less starch in the beef dish. Try the soup. Here's your birthday cake. It has lots of starch. Not on this piece. It has lots of starch too. Hi, Rocky. Where's Mildred? No, of course not... She's here I knew it! Hi, honey. What's the occasion? - It's Rocky's birthday. - Right. Right, that's why I come back. Rocky, thank you for taking care of my wife. - You're welcome. - Why are you eating these for your birthday? My wife must have made these. She must have added lots of starch. Let's dine out. Get changed. I love your tin soup best. Happy Birthday. I went to Taiwan for a long time. Did Mildred introduce you to any girls? Mildred was still in the hospital. Right, she hurt her arms. It should be hard to make calls. How about you? Have you come across anyone on your own? - Yes. - Really? Did it work? She has a boyfriend. It's just a boyfriend. Go for it even if she has a husband. Don't worry. I support you. - I'll dance with my wife now. Enjoy the wine. - Sure, go ahead. Charlie, it's not nice to leave Rocky alone. It's fine. We're old friends. He'd understand. I was in Taiwan for a long time. We need to catch up. Right, honey, I make a lot of progress at Taiwan this time. That's why it took me so long to come back. You're not mad at me, are you? I'll make it up to you and we'll spend more time together. Hi, Mr. Charlie. Hello, Mr. Ojio, it's been a while. I've a film in production in Tokyo. I need a model who looks like a Chinese housewife. Can you help? Sure, of course. When can we meet up? Now is fine. My table is over there. You can come over. Right away I'll be waiting. Honey, let's go back to our table. Rocky, keep Mildred company for me. I need to meet with a client over there. I'm making money again. - Thank you. - Okay, no problem. - Let's dance. - Do you want to dance? The song is nice. - I like it. - Me too. - Please send my wife home for me. - Sure. - I'm signing a contract with the Japanese. - Sure... Thanks. - Bye-bye... - Bye-bye. - Let's stop dancing. Shall we go? - Okay... The Japanese signed the contract really quickly. If only all business deals are as easy as this. Honey, I went to Taiwan for a long time. Did you miss me? I'm tired. I'd been away a long time and you're not interested? I think you need to see a doctor. What? What's wrong with you? Honey, it's 6650, not 665. Honey, get me a cup of coffee. In the previous Community Chest deal, I didn't make a profit because of this deal. Now you're giving it to Robert? You're setting me up! Honey, how come the coffee is colorless? Oh, okay... Today, of course. Honey, where are we going for lunch later? I've an appointment. I thought after Charlie comes back, you won't see me anymore. Why? Do you treat yourself as a reserve? No, but you and Charlie... Do you want to call it off? Fine, let's call it off. - Mildred... - What is it? - Bye-bye. - Say it one more time. I do wrong by Charlie. Fine, if you want to be nice, I won't force you. But I will still tell him that I no longer love him. Mildred! Mildred... Let me talk to him. Okay. Let's meet up after work. I was wondering who Mildred is seeing. - It's you. - Yes. - What did she say? - Nothing. Really? She must have said something. We are buddies. Tell me. Be honest, after I went to Taiwan, - did she see another man? - No. Really? Were you with her? - Me? - Yes, you. Yes, Charlie, she and I... That's great! I feel better knowing she was with you. Mildred thought I went to Taiwan for other women. You know I didn't want to go. Everybody else was having fun. I had to go along. Yes. Next time you see Mildred, put in a good word for me. Okay. You're always my best buddy. I've to get back to office. Bye-bye. Charlie. I will talk to Mildred. Thanks dude. You didn't tell him then? I think he needs you. I know how it feels to be dumped. It's my decision who I want to be with, not yours. If you can't tell him, don't. Mildred. Mildred... Mildred Mildred, come back. - Listen to me. - No. Mildred. Officer, I just left for a second. Please give me another chance. Sure, you'll get a chance. Tomorrow, I won't be here. You can park here if you want. Father. You're early. I'd been waiting the whole morning and caught nothing. You said the ocean is huge. There's always fish. One will find you. Stop teasing your father. Where's your red grouper? Forget it. Mildred? Are you here to ask for my help again? She wants me to confront Charlie. You score with her. Of course you have to confront him. Charlie is my best buddy. So what? I can choose to keep quiet. Then do it quietly. You want me to elope? Eloping is old-fashioned. I mean get on with it first and tell him later. - Can I do that? - Sure. You heard me right. I said it right. This is the right move. Go ahead. Mr. Lee here's your tickets. Thank you - I can go straight to the airport? - Yes. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Honey. What surprise do you have for me? Yes, a surprise. Are you traveling? Where to? No, I'm breaking up with you. Breaking up? Honey, are you kidding? Do you find this funny? Are you mad that I went to Taiwan for too long? Give me an explanation. We've been good together. I thought so too. That's it. I don't stray. I work hard to make money. Where else can you get a guy like me? This is not what I want. Honey. What else do you want? We have a house, a car, a company. If you don't want these, what do you want? These are not necessities. If you feel empty inside, it's useless. Honey... You're being abstract again. One must be realistic. Can you stop being so realistic? Can you stop measuring everything with money? I really don't know what you want. You won't get it even if I reiterate it for the rest of my life. That's why I've decided to break up with you. Tell me, are you in love with someone else? Yes. I don't believe there's someone better than me. Tell me who he is. - It's Rocky. - Rocky? Are you kidding? How can you fall for him? I'm not kidding. You don't have to look for him. He's going away. Charlie! Jan got married, Ian got married. Are you married? - Rocky. - Hello, Mildred. I told Charlie about us. Oh, what should we do? He's looking for you now. Gosh... I've to hang up. I'll figure something out. I'll come over now! Okay... Bye-bye. Oh gosh! What should I do? Wait, I'm sleeping. Coming. Coming... Hi, Charlie, you're early. Charlie, listen to me. Why do you take his side? Don't explain. He didn't even chop up the drumstick for me. Get me a glass. Come, have a drumstick. I've had dinner. You go ahead. Come, sit. Drink with me. Are we best buddies? Yes. I told you to watch Mildred for me, didn't 1? Yes. Do you know she's in love with someone else? - Do you? - I do. I... Yes, she said she's in love with you. - Charlie, listen to me... - Don't. I don't believe it at all. We are best buddies. How could she fall for you? Right? How could she fall for you? It'd never happen. Rocky I've never had any failure in my life. You know this. Actually I really pity you. I finally understand why you were so sad after Mary left. Because I feel your pain now. Don't cry. Lie down in the room. Come. - Ask her not to leave me. - I know... Talk to her for me... Let me get you a towel. Mildred Mildred Wong? Mildred Wong? It's really you! I'm sorry, Charlie. Sorry? Can I apologize after I strangle you? Charlie... Stop! - Calm down! Don't be rash! - You're a jerk! I'll kill you... Are you serious? Go to hell, scumbag! Stop! I'll kill you! Darn you! How could you do this to me? Don't run! I'll kill you! We are childhood friends! I'll kill you! Charlie... Charlie... Are you alright? Rocky! - What are you doing? What happened? - Charlie... - What happened? - Mildred, get here quick. Hold Charlie. I'll call ambulance. - Charlie. - Mildred. Charlie, don't scare me. Wake up! - Mildred... - Charlie, are you alright? Charlie... So? You failed to elope, didn't you? How do you know? History. Since when have you got it right the first time? My life is full of failures. Don't lose hope. - It didn't work this time. Try again. - Try again, right? Dad, I think I'd never try again in this lifetime. Learn from me. Red grouper leaves. I get another fish. Don't worry about it. - Don't bother. Red grouper is back. - Really? Hi, Valentino. You air tickets are useless now, aren't they? Don't waste them. Good luck with your honeymoon. Hi! I'm more of a catch, aren't I? Let's go on a trip. To get married? No, we are doing it first and worry about the rest later. Why? We have to keep up with the trend. Give trial marriage a go. Who's on trial? Me or you? We'll put each other on trial. It's fair that way. No need to try for now. I think I'll have some meatballs instead. Why? - Hi. - Hi. How is it? Are they giving trial marriage a go too? They are. So are we. Dream on! Fine... Hi. Hi. Father, bye-bye.
