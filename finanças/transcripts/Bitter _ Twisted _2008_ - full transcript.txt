You got a dog, don't you? - It died about a year ago. It was run over. - Yeah, I ran over a dog once, it's... It was pretty horrible. I didn't run it over. I never said you did. Your figures are down. Really down. - I know. - Yeah, I know you know. Are you gonna do something about it? - Yeah. - That sounds like a very good idea. Hold on, hey. Smile. World can't be that bad. - Lisa coming down? - Don't know. 10 times-- - You have the exact same thing. Yeah, yeah. Look, can you just hang on a sec, please? Lisa? Would you mind going upstairs and check I haven't left the iron on? - I'm watching this. - Please? I don't want the house to burn down. - Your bedroom? - Yes, thank you. Leon? I think I might be pregnant. - What are you doing? - Do you wanna turn out the lights? - I'm pretty tired. - Okay. That's fine. - I'm tired. - You make me feel like I'm fucking 80! - Don't yell, the kids will hear. - So? So? - Where are you going? - I'm gonna find some red wine and I'm gonna drink it in front of the television. Is that okay? - Yes. Yes. - What are we watching? That's my neighbour. - Did you try to call last night? No. I thought I got a missed call. - No. So what the fuck are you doing here? - Just bored. - Bullshit. - I am. - Hey, you free tonight? - I might be doing something. Doing what? I don't know.

You work today? - No. I don't roster down Saturdays anymore. - Where do you work again? - Wooly's. - I like our walks. - You know, you don't always have to say something? You know that, right? - What? - Nothing. I know it's you. Don't hang up. You'll never see him again. - Jesus. You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing here? - I knocked but you didn't answer. I was calling out. - Let me get you a towel, you look like you're freezing. No, don't worry. - No, no, I'll get you a towel. You can't stay, Pauline'll be home in half an hour. I'll drive you home, we can talk in the car. - Look... Your wife rang me this afternoon. She said that you two were trying to save your marriage and that you still love her. - Listen-- - Actually, the way she put it was that you've been having an affair and that I was the one trying to break up your marriage like you had nothing to do with it at all. That's not what I thought. You told me you were separated, Greg. - Things are very complicated, on all levels. This thing with my wife... I don't know what this thing with my wife is. I'm lost. - That's just something people say when they wanna fuck you over and forgive themselves for it. - I love you, I do. - That's just another thing people say, Greg. - Look, look... I'm sorry.

No. - I might be able to help. - I wanna go to Melbourne. I wanna get outta here. I wanna go to Switzerland. - What the fuck's in Switzerland? Cheese. - Why do you work so hard at making something of this? I mean, you always happen to turn up when I'm having a cigarette on the porch, and you're always here when I'm feeling shitty, and you're always saying, "Let's go for a walk," everyday, I just... Hate it, I hate everything. Why did you? Why did he fucking leave? I just want it all back. I hated it, but I was happier before. Are you talking about your dad? No. - Wake up, Dad. - Hello. - Hey, hi. It's a hot day. - Yeah, it is. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm... I'm fine. - You sure? - Yes. It's just the heat. - Penelope Lumbard, please. Lumbard. - So, what are we looking at today? - Just a pregnancy test. - Sorry? - I'm after a pregnancy test. - Okay. Well, you were right about there being a reason your period was late, but it's not because you're pregnant. I'm assuming you're going through menopause, Mrs. Lumbard. It's nothing concerning, it's a natural process. You're 53, I've had some patients go through this at 40. - I'm sorry? - You're not pregnant. I can arrange for you to talk to somebody about the menopausal process, if you'd like. Dad, Ben, Ben, Dad, remember? - Hey, Ben, long time. - Hey, Mr. Salt. - How's your brother? - Yeah, good, good. - I can't believe you said Mister. Want a drink, Mister? - Do you have any milk? - Yeah, we have milk. - This is Blackie. I froze him in ice just before he died, or as he was dying, so he's reaching up to the light. Funny? - How long ago was that? Nine years. Why don't you lie back? - Why? - I'd like to hold you. Ben? - What? - You okay? - What are we doing? - Nothing. You don't say much, do you? - People like me more if I don't talk. Matt? Where's my glasses? Matt? - Yeah. Just wait here for me. - Yeah. - Hi, Dad. Dad, Dad. Hey, how you doing? You okay? - I've lost my glasses. - They're on your head, Dad. I'm gonna go out, be back by 10. Okay. - Okay. All right, we'll only be a minute. You ready? - Yeah. - No, no, I'll take it, I have to get up anyway. - You can stay asleep, Mom. Mom, do you wanna go to Melbourne? - What? - Let's pack up and go to Melbourne, you and me. Why don't we do it tonight? We just pack a few bags, and then we can just come back for the rest another day. - I can't just pack up and leave. Why? - Because. - Yeah. - I get back here at six o'clock and it's nearly 10 past, what's going on? Can we go out for dinner tonight? Zolini's is good on a Saturday. - It's too crowded. - What's this then? - What? - What is this? Well, it looks very like chips and egg to me but maybe it's a trick question. - Where you going? - Out. - Where? - Do you care? - Yes. - Have a nice chop. ♪ Have you been here before ♪ - Two scotch and dry on a lemonade, thanks, Joe. - The music's really slow, isn't it? - Sorry? - The music, it's depressing. - I don't know, haven't been listening.

What would you say if I asked to kiss you? - Just kiss me. - It's okay, relax. - I should probably go home. Why don't I... Get your number, maybe we could go out for dinner sometime. I'm quite serious, I've... Got a bit of paper here somewhere. They're my keys. Still up? - I was waiting for you. You go to your sister's? - Yeah. - You didn't call. - What are you doing? - Just... Looking. - We should go and visit him tomorrow. - I missed you tonight. - We're gonna have to take Lisa to see the dietician. She started not eating again. She won't listen to me, and I'm sick of yelling at her about it. - I called Lil's at nine, she said you weren't there. - Yeah, well, I didn't get there 'til 9:30, something like that. I went walking for a while first. I was thinking. Goodnight. - Penny. Yeah? - Nothing. - Remember what Vishnu says. ♪ You got to be the lover, I got to be your friend ♪ - I should go.

You've been gone two fucking hours! Come into the meeting room. Now. What am I supposed to say? - I went for a walk, I didn't have a watch. - 30 minutes, that's your lunch. - Sorry. - You can sell cars looking like this? Did you bring another shirt? - Well, I didn't know it was gonna be so hot. - Have you got right off the walls, mate? I mean, what is the problem? - Don't know. - Here is some free advice. Wake up! This is the last time. I promise you that. And you know, everybody feels like shit sometimes. It's not an excuse. It's not. Three years. That's enough. Okay? It's enough. - Mom, you ready? Mom. Mom, it's 2:30 in the afternoon. - I must've dozed off. I thought you had a craft class at two. - I'm too tired. I just don't sleep on the weekend. - Well, are we still gonna go shopping this afternoon? - I'm too tired, darling. - Okay. - Max, go inside. Inside now, son. What are you doing here? - You've been ignoring me. - What do you want me to say? - Well, you wanna pretend it never happened, is that it? - Yes, I think it's better. - Better for you. - You have to go, Pauline's inside. - I bought... I bought two tickets for Melbourne for us, it was supposed to be a surprise for your birthday. - Can't go to Melbourne with you. - I'm pregnant. Reckon she'd like that? - You're not pregnant. - I've known for a few weeks, and I wanted to tell you, I couldn't. So anyway, I'm gonna have your baby, Greg. - You have to go. I'll call you later. - I fucking hate you. - You all right to drive? - I'm fine. So fine. Just relax. Over there. It's under your leg, under your leg. Yo. Sierra. What's happening, babe No, I told you, I can't do that on Sunday. What the hell are you doing? - Nothing. - You know, I am interested in you. You know that, don't you? You pretend you don't, but you play into it. - Sorry? - I know, it's hard to understand it's... Changes, it's life. It's me. And it's not 'cause I've had a drink, you know? It's me. Maybe you don't know. I think you do, I really think you do. I really do. There is this thing, this thing with time and with people. It's where everybody holds back and never says what they really want, like maybe tomorrow's gonna bring the opportunity where they never have to do anything. Anything for themselves. It's just gonna happen for them, like it was some plan set out by the universe, and they're owed this. Love. Time. Fate. It's all the same thing. Same fucking beast, it's the very same thing. It's about knowing what you want and taking it. Knowing who you want, and doing something about it. I think... I think about you all the time. You're a really funny guy, Ben. You're a really funny guy. And yeah, I have a girlfriend, you're right. I love her. I have for five years, but I'm not gonna fucking marry her. But you know, Ben, do you know? - What? - I don't wanna miss maybe the greatest moments in life I might ever get... 'Cause I loved her. - Matt... You have a girlfriend. Yes. - You have a girlfriend, Matt. - I'm not doing anything, Ben. It's melting. Yeah. Mom? Mom? Who do I look like? God, that isn't funny. - I didn't do it for you. - Take it out. - I can't. - Take it out! - Mom. Cost me $80. Don't play stupid, Benjamin. Go away, go away from me. Go to your room, go anywhere you like. I don't care what you do. What is wrong with you? - Hey. - Hi. - Could you drive me somewhere, please? - Yeah. Actually, Mom's not talking to me at the moment, she won't give me the keys. - My mom's got a car. Are you supposed to look like Liam? - Do you like it? - I don't know. Why would you do that? - I'll be back in a minute. Will we be long? - I don't know. Hey, do you have a baseball bat? Just pull over here. And you can just go around the block. I'll be like, five minutes. - What are you doing? - I'm just gonna visit a friend. Hello. Is your daddy here? Max! I want that room spotless. Dad, there's a girl with a baseball bat. Max? Dad, dad. There's a girl here for you. What's the matter? There's a girl with a baseball bat. - You're kidding me? You gotta go. - You didn't call me. - I couldn't! - Max! Max, come on, come on, we're going, come on! - You don't have to go, I just wanna talk-- Talk? - Pauline, you don't have to go. - I don't care. Max? Come on, we're going, come on, Max. No, no, wait, she's leaving. - Quick. - She's leaving. - Come on, Max. No, fuck you, Greg, fuck you. - You don't have to go, you know, I just wanna speak. - Get out! Get out of my house! Come on, darling. - You trying to punish me? - You didn't call me. - What's the bat for? - I don't know. To scare you. Christ, Greg, why are you doing this to me? I'm having your baby. Look, just stop it, okay? Leave it. - Well, what do you want me to do with it? - You're not pregnant! All right? You can't be pregnant. I can't have kids. - You have a son. - Do you wanna think about that? - You have a son. - Just think about it for five seconds, think about it! - You have a son. - He's adopted! - Why didn't you tell me? - There are lots of things I haven't told you. - I thought you loved me. Where are we going? - Max, Max, come on. - Wait, Pauline, Pauline, wait. Come on. - She's leaving, she's leaving, she's leaving. - I don't care! I don't care, Greg. - Please don't go. - You brought her here! Please don't go, please. - You brought her here to your son! It's finished, it's finished. Don't, Greg, I don't care! - Please, please don't leave. God, please. You brought her here to your son! - It's finished, finished. - You did this, it's you, Greg! It's finished, it's finished.

Where we going? - I don't know. I just wanna walk. You know what, go home. - You're seeing that guy from the news agent, aren't you? I think you should know, he's married. I think about you all the time. I know you went out with Liam, that doesn't mean that you couldn't-- - Different people. - No, no, we're practically the same. - I'm pregnant. Still think you love me? - Yes. Are you really pregnant? - Come visit me in nine months and you can see her. - It's a girl? - yes. - How do you know? - Doesn't matter, I'll fucking kill it! - Is it his? Is it that guy from the news agent? - I'm not talking to you about it. - What's his name? - Greg. - We could call the baby Greg. - Leave me alone! Just leave me alone! Go home! - It's a fine car. Got all the zero four features, power windows, CD player, air conditioning, air bags, alloy wheels, ABS brakes, power steering, and central locking, and a partridge in a pear tree. - Got one yet? - Not yet. - There's a few hours left, it'll happen. If you have any problems with it in the next five months you can bring it back here and I'll make better than it was before, I promise. Would you like to come and see it? Yes. - I need chocolate. Hello? - Hey, it's me. Hey, I was just thinking... It's, it's been really bothering me. Pen, I can't... You didn't go to your sister's, did you? - No, I didn't. I can't talk to you about this now, Jordan, I'm at the shop. - Look, I'll talk to you when I get home. Jordan? Fuck off! Get in the car! - I want to walk! - You asked me to drive you! - Yeah, because I needed a lift! - Well, why don't you get in the car? We can get gelato. - It's like you're in denial. - I'm not giving up until you get in. - It's my mom's car, you're gonna break it. - Then get in. - Leave me alone! - No! How do I put on park again? - Can you please go home, Ben? - I can't. I've never really wanted anything before. - You're not Liam. - You can make me whoever you want. - You're not Liam. Do you wanna go to Melbourne with me? - When are we coming back? I'm not. - Okay. - Bus leaves Highwater Road at 11, if you're coming. - I'm coming. - Hi. It's a good car. It's our flagship model, our Rock of Gibraltar. We sell more of these cars than any other. Perhaps you'd like to take it for a quick drive. You'll find it handle just as well as the Torch series you were looking at, but for half the price. Yeah, okay. Shit. Are you all right? - What time are we gonna be finished tonight? - Are you all right? We're calling someone. Go. Call my wife. Yeah, I will, I will. It's all right. God, is that yours or mine? - Yours, Mom. - Hello? There we go, ready, on three, go. It's all right, it's okay, man, you're all right. - Two, three, up. - You're gonna be all right, mate. Okay, in we go. You're hurting me! Well, hurry up! - Sir, I need you to concentrate for a minute, are you allergic to aspirin at all? Okay, I'm gonna give you one, if you could just swallow that for me. Open your mouth. Now, hold there, thanks. Thank you. - You've been ignoring me. Give me a sec. Yes. Where are you? - Hospital. - What are you doing there? - Dad. If you want I'll come meet you somewhere. - Can't. - Have you been thinking about me? - I don't know. - You can tell me, it's all right. It's safe. I tell you what, if you don't say anything I'll take that to mean you have. - Have what? - This is bullshit. - Dad fell over at work, I don't know what happened. What is it? - I don't know. Heart attack? - I don't know yet. - Is he all right? - Yes. No. He's asleep at the moment. Mom's in talking to somebody. I don't know what's going on, I'm just at the hospital. - Yeah, I know. You told me. What am I gonna do with you right now? - I don't know. You could kill me, it's probably a good place to start. - You're a funny puppy. - Woof. - If you need anything, call me, even just to talk. - Yeah, I'll call you. - Is it worth me asking again? Have you been thinking about me? What should I say? - Say nothing. - Nothing. I am gonna go. Thank you. Goodbye. - Hey. - Hey. How are you? - Tired. Sorry if I scared you. Where's Ben and Lisa? - Ben's gone back home, Lisa's getting something to eat. She's fine. - Donald called me, he told me, and I didn't... I didn't. God, I got makeup everywhere. - It's okay. There's nothing to worry about. - I couldn't talk before, I was at the supermarket. - It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. I trust you, I do. I don't know what I was going on about. - I lied to you, Jordan. God, this is hard. I... I went to a bar. I don't know why. And this guy made me feel... I don't know. He made me feel wanted. I would never do anything to you. He tried, and... For a minute... Jordan, I love you so much. But you know... You don't love me. Since Liam died we've all become so closed. And everything stopped, but... Time didn't. I can't do this anymore. This isn't the person I thought I'd become. Jordan, why are you like this? You're like a wall. I can't get through, and it's ripping me. - There's nothing. - What? - There's... There's nothing that I... I don't know. Nothing. - Look what I've got. - Orchids. - See? I listen, Dad. - We should get going, Dad needs to have a rest. Give me a call if you need a lift home. Okay. All right. - Bye, Dad. See you, Lissy. - I've gotta go. - I've changed my mind. Could you take a left up here near the lights, I need to go through Ardenbury... And say something to my boss. Fuck you. I don't wanna sell your cars anymore. - Good. - I've hated working for you, every single day since your father left. You've gone off the rails, man. - I know. And thank you... For calling my wife. - Come down and... Buy a car from me some day. I'll show you how it's done. - Fuck you, man, fuck you! - Ben, set the table, please. I wanna eat in here. - Set the table, please. - Smells good. I called a cab. People come from all over the world just to catch a. Where are you going? - Be back in a minute. - It's almost 11. - I'm just ducking out to get some coke. - There's nowhere open. - Be back in a minute. - Be careful. - Lissy. Hey, Lissy, it's time for bed. - Jordan, this isn't gonna go away. We can't keep on tippy-toeing around it. Please... Talk to me. This is my life. It's my life. - Things happen. Things happen all the time. We can't let it kill us. I quit my job tonight. I'd been thinking about it for weeks, and... On the way home I thought about Liam... All the opportunities he'll never have... And I just did it. I should've done it the first time I thought about it. I want my family. I love you. I do. All my life. - They're all the letters you wrote to Liam. Mom never threw away anything. - Did you read these? - No. Yes. - I'll write you a letter. - I'd like that. - Liam... How are you?
