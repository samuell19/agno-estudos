Rock lobster! Reindeer! Let's do animals with a 'K'-sound. -Crow. Crocodile. -Kangaroo. Cockroach. Let's get off the highway... ...and see some local colour. No. Not as long as you refuse to drive. What are you doing? Just looking at the fuel gauge. -You just look in your mirror! lf you sat behind the wheel, you'd see the gauge far better! Look! There's one tree! A tree! lncredible! Another one tree! Peel me an orange. Wonderful ''local colour''! My nightmare. l dreamed it again last night. -About the golden egg? That you're locked inside it and have to fly through space all alone forever? The loneliness is unbearable. No... This time there was another golden egg flying through space. Far away. But if we collided it would all be over! Rex, what's that? Fuel. -No! No! lt's my fault, but that's beside the point. This is very dangerous! My lights are on! -The warning light! There's no warning light on this car. See what happens when you behave like an idiot! Don't panic dammit! Never mind how we got here, we need to get out! And if you start getting hysterical... -l am not hysterical. l'm scared. The golden egg... This is no time for dreams, we have to go. Come on! They can't see us! We'll be run over. -l'll take the torch! What torch? -l packed one! Any minute now there'll be a car on top of us! l have to find the torch. -Come on, god dammit! Don't touch me! You go! You won't find it in that mess. l'm going! Rex. Wait! l'll find it in a minute! Don't leave me here alone! You can't leave me alone! Rex! Wait! That way! ...you only need to be better than your adversary... What'll it be? Fill it up, please. And this one too. lf you want we can go back to Amsterdam. l'm sorry about earlier. l didn't know what to do. But l shouldn't have left you alone. l've also put fuel in the bidon. -What? ln the jerry can. l love you. ln the tunnel, when you called me, l loved you very much. l hated you! We're going to have a wonderful stay in my little house. What are we waiting for? -l need to use the toilet! l'll wait over there. ...and here comes the pack with Delgado in the lead... 300 francs please. Please move on. Rex, catch! A frisbee for 13.50 francs! What's that for? Because you're driving all the time. lt helps against stiffness. From the girl who loves roses most when there are eight of them! But l don't smoke. -You can give me a light! May l still go on holiday? Two conditions! Name them. l drive to Bois Vieux! You let a lovely lady drive with such a key ring? And the second condition? -Counting trees! ...7 ...8! ...Fignon is climbing very smoothly and Hinault... ...and Hinault has been left behind! Now he is paying the price for his repeated attacks all the way up... Fignon, with supreme confidence, masters the situation... ...anything can happen, an important chapter in the Tour is unfolding... l, me, Rex Hofman... Swear, that the wonderful... Swear that the wonderful... ...exquisite and sweet... ...exquisite and nearly always sweet... The always-sweet Saskia Wagter... ...will never again be abandoned by me! l'll keep them. To get used to them. You're such a baby. Let's have a drink and then drive to Bois Vieux. Shall l go and get it? -No, it's on me. Do you want a beer? Sounds good. Money? l'm such a baby. Why would anyone need to get used to car keys? Enjoy the rest of your trip! CAR GETTlNG USED TO SASKlA Hinault is really suffering. He's being passed by Herrera who finished this last ascent in the lead... ...and by Fignon who's on his way to winning the yellow jersey of this tour. l'M LOOKlNG FOR YOU. WAlT AT THE CAR. You're in the way! l'm looking for my wife! This isn't the men's toilet! l can't find my wife! -This isn't the ladies' toilet. Driven by a courage which is almost sacrificial... Clients aren't allowed in here. l'm looking for my wife. She came to buy a beer and a coke... She's got reddish hair with little... She's wearing white jeans and a yellow jersey. Fignon's wearing the yellow jersey! You mean a yellow top? -Yes, with gold in it. Hang on, l've got a picture. Yes, l saw her! -When? About half an hour ago. She was near the coffee machine. But she came to buy cold drinks? She was near the coffee machine then she came to get change. Was she alone or did she talk to someone? 10,000 people come through here each day. And none of them know each other! Have you seen this woman? Yes, l saw her walk out with a guy a few minutes ago. Minutes? -About 15. Your lady was leaving the shop carrying two cans. A coke and a beer. Did she come out alone or with someone? -Alone, l think. l don't know. And then? -l did an oil change... But where did you see her last? At that door! lf she was here with the drinks she was on her way back... So she must have seen me. Which means l could also see her! The Polaroid! There she is! The little red dot... lt's her! lt can only be her! And next to her... ...there's a man! He must be found! The bikes! Mr. Hofman... Believe me, l take you seriously. You know you didn't quarrel with your wife, but how can the police know that? She's disappeared, hasn't she? -Your wife's been missing a few hours... The police sees it as a domestic quarrel. And if they had to react every time... lf she's not back by tomorrow morning they'll move! That's too late! We have to do something now! She could have been kidnapped... He must have left some trace... -Tomorrow morning l will... We don't have to wait for the police... She was next to the coffee machine, she spoke to someone. lf he took coffee, his fingerprints will be on some of the coins. We have to keep them till the police get here! You can't be serious. That's absurd! Tomorrow morning... HOUSE FOR SALE - R. LEMORNE - NlMES Careful! l don't think it's very stable! l'm not surprised with this dump! -lf your grandma heard you! As a reward for your patience with me, look what l bought! The corkscrew is in the drawer. Spiders! Cute, friendly little animals! That was a good scream. Do it again! -l can do it louder! And Mommy? So how's the house coming along? -We're doing what we can. Why don't you cut down more trees? Let the sun come in! Then so will the burglars! -A beautiful house should be shared! l was there yesterday with the family, l don't know whether you saw us? When we arrived we thought we heard screams coming from there. You didn't hear anything? -l didn't hear a thing. Are you going to N?mes? -Yes. l'm with a friend. So l see! Listen, you are cheaters. There's space for two but l stopped for her alone. So, 'bye! l went to the edge. So 12 cc equals... What was it? 18'54''. 18 minutes 54 seconds unconscious equals about... ...20 miles... Which gives me 3 or 4 minutes margin. Not bad! Good day, Madame. What a coincidence! You may as well go by car! Handkerchief. lt's a bit short... l'll start again. Why d'you do that? Because l like you! -No... the lock. Didn't you read the paper? A girl fell out of a car on the highway recently. How awful! ls she dead? What do you think? The concrete, the speed of the cars... Of course she's dead. Have you got a mistress? Don't look so shocked. lt's okay at your age! At the house in St. C?me. l know what you do! Excuse me, the Prisunic? -l'm going there myself! You can come with me! Lucky coincidence! l think l'd prefer to walk. Of course. lt's a lovely day! Go down this street, it's on the right... 15.42... Pulse rate 90. ...the euphoria of victory in this fine setting. Zoetemelk in 76 and 79... ...Kuiper in 77 and 78... ...Winnen in 81 and 83 carried on the Dutch tradition. ls there another woman? No. WlLL FlGNON TAKE THE YELLOW JERSEY? Don't you want to know why l asked? lf it wasn't me who was going there l'd think like you. The time l spend at St. C?me, all the mileage... Simone, l love you! And l love our two daughters. And l'm probably the last Frenchman... ...who can boast of having known only one woman in his life. lt's the mileage. lt's 13 miles to the house, 26 there and back... Lately you've been averaging... ...50 miles a day! l used to dream of a wife who loved numbers. Well, l have one! Denise. Stay in your room! The house in St. C?me is like a passion. Because that's what it's become! You start with an idea... You take a step... ...and then another... Then you realise you're up to your neck in something that is senseless. But that's not the point. You persevere for the sake of persevering... ...for the satisfaction that may give! That can't be measured in miles, my dear! The remaining riders go into the final week of the race... l'm looking for the Prisunic. -Are you by car? Mr. Lemorne from N?mes! You don't recognise me? Gisele Marzin. l know your daughter Gabrielle. l was her volleyball teacher. Of course! We met frequently at matches. Do you come to Remoulins often? l'm sorry, l don't have time. We could have a quick coffee! No, l really am in a rush. The Prisunic? Take the highway in any direction. lt's full of foreigners. You stop at any gas station... ...and you'll find hundreds of women. No one will recognize you! lf you want, we can go back to Amsterdam. THlS WOMAN DlSAPPEARED THREE YEARS AGO. That guy's starting with his posters again. -Which guy? We've argued about this before. -We argue about everything. You wanted to kill anyone who kidnapped young girls. And l said what if l had? The Dutch girl. What about it? -Nothing. l admire perseverance. You mean obsession! After three years! l don't get it! He's quite a guy! Good glue! -That's right! Sometimes l imagine that she's still alive. Somewhere far away. She's very happy. And then l give myself a choice. Either l let her go on living and l never know anything... ...or l let her die... ...and l find out everything. Then l let her die. l don't feel like always being part of a trio. Mineral water. Do you know anyone called Montm?jean? -l am. Sorry? -My name is Montm?jean. Thank you. ''l want to see you 13 September. 15.00. Caf? Des Beaux Arts. N?mes. Montm?jean.'' He's watching me. l can feel it. l think he's a lunatic. lf he really was involved he wouldn't put himself in such danger. This is now the fifth time he's got me running after him. And always within 50 miles of the gas station. He's building up courage! He knows that l could've seen him then and that l might recognize him now! And then? Then? No idea. D'you know what l'm afraid of? That he stops sending the postcards. What if he's dead? Then l'll never know! You won't ever know. He's playing with you. He followed the story with the posters... ...and he wants to see how far you'll go. He only needs to send a postcard and you obey. He's having great fun! We'll see. Quarter to four. Shall we go? Let him go to hell! -He is here! Saskia was... -Saskia is gone, Rex! She's gone! Show this nutcase that you're not interested anymore. lf you want to do something meaningful come lie with me in the sun. lf Saskia were here now, l'd go with you. But if l could choose... ...l'd rather be at the gas station. Three years ago! Where d'you want to go? To Anduze - Bois Vieux. l've never been there. lt's time you did. l've had enough of your ''sacred places''. There might be people up there. Crocodile... Chameleon... Caterpillar... Here we are! Golden egg... Golden egg... What about this egg? Come on! Here l am! Rex Hofman! Here l am! Come on! Come and show yourself! Hey, piss off man! What's going on shitface! Haven't you finished with your crap? l'm waiting for you! Come on! -Shut up or l'm coming down. Show yourself! Last equation! Thirty seconds. Fifteen. Five. Time's up! Where are you? -Next to the fountain. ln this crowded square in Arles there might be a murderer. You see him without knowing it. He's just another face in the crowd! A gripping situation which Mr. Hofman has experienced five times! Look, that's us! How many times did the police video it? -You missed it! Only the first and second. They now think it's a bad joke. But you don't agree? No. And l hope this gentleman is listening. There's something l want to say to him. l want to meet you. l want to know what happened to my friend. l'm prepared to do anything. l don't hate you. l don't hate lightning. l want to know. l'm sorry. l hope you eventually find out something. She's working in a brothel in Marseilles. l'm going to see her again in three days! Madame Phoenix, Montelimar! Take a look? ln this crowded square in Arles there might be a murderer. You see him without knowing it. He's just another face in the crowd! A gripping situation which Mr. Hofman has experienced five times! l want to know! Do you have any idea what kind of man he is? l think... l'm sure he's very intelligent. An inconspicuous person... He loves perfection. Something puzzles me. This new campaign is costing at least 300,000 francs... ...which you've had to borrow. Why now? After three years? Not long ago l had a dream. The same dream my friend had the night before she disappeared. She dreamed... ...we would meet in the universe... ...each of us locked inside a golden egg. And in my dream we also met in the universe. l interpreted this as a sign. Do you have any hope? Of finding her? No! Why don't you give up? lt's a homage, sir. Nice. A homage to the vanished loved one. lf you have any information about this young girl, please contact us. Thank you, Mr. Hofman. You're quite photogenic. l'm sorry. How are you? Okay. Really? Do you know Lieneke's Law? The first Relationship Law... Getting over separation takes half the time the relationship lasted. So in about four months l'll be over it. lt's a pity. lf there'd been no Saskia... But Saskia was and still is... Can't you see that? l'll call you. l'm the man you're looking for. The caf? in N?mes. l saw you but you weren't alone, l didn't dare disturb you. ls she dead? Come to France and you'll find out everything. And that she's dead? -l'm offering you this one chance. Finished? l must warn you, l've taken precautions! lf anything happens to me, if you speak to anyone, the deal's off. And you'll never know. l'm going back to France with or without you. l'm leaving in five minutes. All this time l was afraid you might be dead. lf you're hungry, l've come prepared. Passport. lf they don't stop us, l promise to tell you everything. Lemorne, Raymond. 6 Place aux Herbes, N?mes. The last time you had me come close to where you live! l don't like the idea that you know my name, l have to minimise my risks. But you could have found it out by my car number. There's nothing to gain from re-opening an inquiry. You won't find any evidence. The coins from the coffee machine. Your fingerprints were on them! lf l'd taken coffee l'd have held the coins by the edge. You're on a Polaroid l took at the gas station! Wrong! You'd have recognized me at the caf? in N?mes. The second table to the right... Passport. l've thought a lot about our meeting. Right from the start l felt the need to see you. When you left the caf?, l realised l couldn't wait any longer. What you said on television convinced me. l gathered the courage you spoke about. You can kill me. l acknowledge your right to do so. l'm taking a risk... ...but l'm gambling on your curiosity. You want to know what happened to Miss Saskia. When l was sixteen, l made a discovery... Everyone has those thoughts, but no one ever jumps! l pictured myself jumping... ls it predestined that l won't jump? How can it be predestined that l won't jump? So to go against what is predestined, one must jump! lt was quite a fall! l broke my left arm, lost two fingers. Why did l jump? A slight abnormality in my personality... ...unnoticed by those around me. You could find me in a medical encyclopaedia... ...under ''Sociopath'' - in the modern editions! Did you rape Saskia? Come now, Mr Hofman! lt took me 26 years to find the idea for a new experiment... Who'll be first? Denise! l thought so! A bit to the left... To the left. Leave a space between you and mommy... Smile! Otherwise no allowance! There's a little girl in the water! Bidule drowned! Who's Bidule? She's my dolly. That man won't save her! You're a real hero! Jumping without even thinking... Of course l'm a hero! But watch out for heroes! They're capable of excess! My daughter was bursting with admiration. But l thought that her admiration for me wasn't worth anything... ...unless l could prove myself absolutely incapable of doing anything bad! And since there's no white without black... ...l obviously had to conceive the worst thing l could think of. But, l should add, for me the worst thing is not to kill! Could we stretch our legs? Do you still go cycling in France? You were an amateur, weren't you? ln cycling, amateur is a category. l cycled for pleasure. That's what l said, you are an amateur! Uphill on the Ventoux peak is the best place to watch the Tour de France go by. A mile before the top you'll see who'll give way, and who'll try for a breakaway! That's where l saw Zoltemeck. A compatriot of yours. Know him? Doesn't sound very Dutch. Sounds more like a Mexican god! lt's Zoetemelk. Couldn't be more Dutch. lt means sweet milk. Mr. Sweetmilk? Some weird names there! Naaktgeboren - Mr. Nakedborn. My neighbour's got a dog called Rex! Dodeman - Mrs. Deadman. Marriage produces some strange combinations. l know a woman called Fry her toes! Friar-Towes. ln the N?mes telephone book there's someone called Poof! We're not good at foreign languages in France. l need help! That's where l'm losing time! That's better! ...l'll wait for you there! Shitface! -Excuse me? Nothing! Your French is good. lt certainly makes things easier. My method wasn't very successful. l couldn't get the women l chose into my car. Prostitutes, yes. But they don't interest me. They're destined to become victims. Nobody mourns them. l was getting high blood pressure. Frustration. And now the presents! This one is from me. TlLES For the house at St. C?me. lt's a key ring for your car keys. For all those miles you have to drive! More? RAYMOND LEMORNE YOUR LlFE My glasses. Look at his ears! -lsn't he cute? A bit chubby! That's when you fell from the balcony. The trailer didn't need to be heavier... l needed to be weaker! This is the Tour de France. We're ascending to the Coq-Pass... ...and things are getting serious on the 1 7th day of the race... Hinault is pushing down hard to break away from Fignon. But Fignon is not giving in. He knows he'll be wearing the yellow jersey later. The two men confront each other now, swords drawn. The duel really began with Hinault's heavy offensive. Fignon does not weaken... Arroyo in front of Delgado, Millar, Fignon and Hinault... ...the fight begins... You only need to be better than your adversary! And that's when you arrived. Your friend kissed you before she got out. We're now exactly 12 miles from the summit of the Alpe d'Huez. This is an extraordinary day. We shouldn't bury Hinault too quickly. He's fighting back with exceptional bravery... ...crossing swords with Fignon! Broken? ln Germany it's forbidden to drive like that! Even as a passenger? l broke my arm when l was 1 1 . ln 1940. 59. You're 59 years old. l will be, in November. l'm still 58! Yes, but most of the year has passed. So it was more likely you'd be 59... Therefore my assumption was the most correct. Do you speak French? -Of course! Could you help me? l need to hitch a trailer onto my car but l can't do it alone... My car. -Where's the trailer? Over there! l'll bring the car. l can come with you, if you don't mind! How can you drive like that? No problem. Excuse me. Fate, Mr. Hofman! lf l hadn't sneezed... Do you speak French? l am French. l don't have enough francs for the machine. Can you change for me? l've got a one franc piece... ...two 2 franc pieces... so if you have 5 francs... No, l haven't got 5... ...but 10, yes! And if you have a 5... l don't have a 5 but... Oh sorry, it's very kind but l prefer to... l'm driving on the highway for the first time! lt's very good to speak French... My friend always says l must trying... Try. You speak very good French. You're liar! Yes. Hey, look me! ln your hand, very nice! Because my friend has... l love him very much... ...he also has a name with R. Rex, Roel, Roger... Raymond. Good. ls it possible for me to buy the thing? l'm the representative for these things. l sell them. l have plenty... in my car. Here? l want ver... can... Shit! Want to buy this thing! Why not? But not much? 13.50... Like the frisbee? l want very much! Tiles! -Oh, that's what they're called! l want a tile with an ''R''! Get in! Get in! All one's planning can be wiped out... Now what? A faulty contact! You weren't wearing your safety belt. -l have a dispensation... ...medical certificate... l am claustrophobic. Correct! See what l mean... All one's planning can be wiped out in an instant, just by chance! And that saddens me! What did you do with her? -l will tell you, as promised. But the only way to tell you is to let you undergo what she did. You're crazy! Not important. So she isn't dead? Drink. What is that? A sleeping pill. l drugged her. l'm going to drug you. And after that? After that you'll experience exactly what she experienced. So if she's dead, l'm also going to die! You are mad! lt's the only way. l don't believe this. l don't want to punish you. l won't tell anyone. l don't give a damn about you. l only want to know what happened to her. l understand that. l put myself in your place. l believe, in fact, that you don't want to punish me. But l'm not sure that l'm right in believing you. Understand? l believe you, but l'm forced to act as though l don't! So, drink it. lt's really the only way. What's in it? l told you, a sleeping pill dissolved in coffee. The car keys... l'd like to see them again. Understand once and for all! What use are these keys to you? You have no proof against me. -You're bluffing! Let's assume that you're right, can you be absolutely sure? That's your problem. You have to take into account that there may be no proof against me. You'd be gambling against the odds. l've been analysing what goes on in your mind for three years. You can take the keys. You can even go to the police. But then you'll probably never know what happened to Miss Saskia. On the other hand, if you drink... ...in less than an hour, you'll know! l guarantee it. l know all l need to know. l'm going. And the uncertainty? The eternal not knowing, Mr. Hofman? That's the worst thing there is! l wanted to do you a favour! Well? l pictured myself drinking... ls it predestined that l won't drink? So to go against what is predestined, one must drink! lt will take effect in ten minutes. lt's for her that l drank. Of course. She didn't give you the time to not love her. lt can't be! My name is Rex Hofman and that's a bit weird! MYSTERlOUS DOUBLE DlSAPPEARANCE
