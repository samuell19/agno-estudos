I hope the hotel has a wire service. -Honey. -What? Honey, of the two of us, I'm supposed to be the workaholic. Well, this is my last fundraiser as Chair. I want it to be perfect. Isn't Celia taking over till we get home? Celia's a great foot soldier, but I'm... But you're the General. Yes. But, um... Do you have the guts to go topless? I have to say that you are the most beautiful General on the beach. Quite a compliment from somebody who sees 40 breasts a day. Aw. I can't believe I'm doing this. Well, Sybil. If anyone ever sees that picture... No way. No way. Not on your life. That desk job's taking your edge. Yeah? Then how come I'm the one with your hat? Come on, baby. Hey, hey. Do I have to send you guys to your room without supper? You're going to the gym now? Yeah, I want to get in a few practice shots before the game. You guys coming? Hey, you know it, wouldn't miss it. All right, see you. Hey. That other guard might be bigger, but you're smarter, and that counts. Don't forget that. I won't, Mom, thanks. You're right on schedule for your exam. I'm going to bring you right up into the machine here. Now we're just going to do your side view. Just need to raise your arm up on the machine. Great tan, by the way. Thank you. I was vacationing in Sicily with my husband. You might know him, Dr. Goldrich in Obstetrics. No, afraid not. Hold your breath. And breathe. Okay, that's it. We're all finished. That was the last one. Thank you. - You see those areas? - Yes. Those areas show microcalcifications. I'd like to schedule a biopsy. What if it's cancer? Why don't we wait for the results? I want to know everything now. Worst case. Okay, worst case, I'd recommend a bilateral mastectomy. It's the best way to make sure the cancer's removed from your body. But please, don't expect the worst. Schedule the biopsy now. I want to know what I'm up against here. "Breast implants have become the trendiest cosmetic fix and as sought-after as Chanel knockoffs and designer jeans." What's this doing on my desk? Um... Something that I've wanted to talk to you about for a long time. -Yeah? -Yeah. I'd think I'd like to do it. But why? Sweetheart, I... I love you just the way you are. I know, I know. It's just... I feel like I look... Imbalanced. -Imbalanced? -Yeah. You know... Flat on the top and round on the bottom. You don't look anything like that. You are a very beautiful woman. I tried on every bathing suit in the store last season, and nothing could hide it. I really think that you're being, over... Overly critical here, sweetheart. You know? I just wish that you liked yourself more. I like who I am. Just not what I look like. When my sister and I were kids, I was the only one who used to play basketball with my dad. Guess I kind of became his boy by default. Boy, it's got to be expensive. You know, our insurance doesn't cover, um... Unnecessary procedures and operations and stuff like that. I know, I thought about that. David? -I wouldn't ask if it wasn't something... -Yeah. I want it. And it's supposed to be a simple operation. I just really wish that you didn't feel like you needed it. But, you know, it's your body and... And if it'll make you happy, then... I guess I'll figure something out. There we go. Dr. Hirschville, call the page operator. Dr. Hirschville, call the page operator. Amy, will you come on? We're already late. Dad's probably called up the Marines. Let go of me. I skipped lunch and I'm starving, okay? Please. You go, I'll be there in a second. They probably don't want food in there. You're so full of it. I hate hospitals. You know, I... I just hate that Mom has to have, you know... How do you think Mom feels, Amy? You'll start to feel drowsy in a couple of minutes. Don't fight it. When you wake up, it'll be all over. I'm trying to imagine waking up and not having breasts. Sybil... They wouldn't do this procedure unless it was absolutely necessary. Bentley is a great surgeon. I know. I know. Jimmy, um... After this is over, I... I've been doing some reading and I would... I would like to look into implants. Honey... I will not be able to look at myself without breasts. Will you? Sybil... I love you. I will be very different. Your body, not you. And I don't care about anything except you getting well. There they are. Come here. Come here. I was about to call out the Marines. See? Come here. Come here. Come here. This thing is starting to work. It's okay, honey. It's okay. We're all here. Are you sure there's enough skin to work with? I... I talked to lots of surgeons. One of them even said to me during the examination, "Boy, they stripped you bare." I can make you whole again. But first we've got to make sure you're comfortable with the procedure. How long are the implants supposed to last? According to the manufacturer, a lifetime. So they must be safe? I've performed over 100 successful operations. The implants are filled with silicone. It's a man-made compound of oxygen and silicon. Now, the best thing about silicone is it's inert. It doesn't react to the body. I wish I knew someone who'd done this. I... My nurse can give you the number of one of my other patients. Call her. I will. I won't lie to you, Sybil. At first, it was painful, but they have shots for that, and gradually, it fades. Some people thought I was crazy for having unnecessary surgery, but... But after the cancer, I felt totally out of control. Choosing to have implants gave me control over my body again. Do you think that I could see them? Sure you can. Now? Rosemary, they're beautiful. Thanks. May I feel them? Be my guest. They are so soft. Honey? Wow. You look great, sweetheart. I mean, not that you didn't before. You looked fine before. But, my goodness. I know. Believe me, I'm happier about this than I ever imagined. Now... The surgeon gave me strict instructions to massage them, to keep scar tissue from forming. Did he? Well, I guess you're going to need some help with that? Sweetheart. You know, I'd like to be there when the bandages come off. How about I meet you at Sutton's office tomorrow morning? How about a sneak peek, Doc? You're like Xena on her birthday. Nervous? - Nah. - Right. Am I hurting you? No. But if you happen to have a spare bullet, I could bite it. Sorry, fresh out. See anything you like, sailor? Yeah. You. I'll get it. Mom! Mom? Mommy, what's wrong? Are you okay? Mommy. And they feel as hard as baseballs. This can't be normal. Actually, it does happen. I'll have to do a capsulotomy. I don't like the sound of that. It's a way of breaking through the scar tissue. Hang on to the table, this is going to hurt. If he couldn't break the scar tissue, and they're still hard... Now what? Surgery again. And now he says there's a new kind of implant called a Meme. It's a foam covering that's supposed to keep them from getting hard. And what're you thinking? I'm thinking that it's maybe time to talk to another surgeon. Sutton is supposed to be the best. And nothing was supposed to go wrong. I just don't think another surgeon is the answer. Well, if you have any better ideas, I would really like to hear them. I just want this to be the last operation. Come on, Mom, all net. Hey, that's all right, Ma. Even Magic has a bad game now and then. Yeah... I kind of have a bad season. I can't seem to shake this cold. There she is. I have pneumonia? It's not a personality flaw, Kathleen. I never get sick. How could this happen? You're a busy wife and mother. Don't be so hard on yourself, it'll pass. Dr. Frederick to OR 2. Dr. Frederick to OR 2. Is she okay? That took a lot longer than we thought. You of all people should know these things take longer than expected. - She did just fine. - Good. These new implants shouldn't give her any problems. Thank you. We need to check the infection. Let's see what Sutton has to say. Why do we need Sutton to confirm the obvious? The fevers, the rashes... My body is reacting to the foam implants. They're going to have to be replaced. Why not just say it? Because I'm not a plastic surgeon. But if the implants have to be removed... Stop it. Perhaps we shouldn't put new ones in. Don't even mention it. Sybil, your body, anybody's body, is bound to be exhausted after cancer surgery and two implant operations. You don't have to keep doing this to yourself. Jimmy, I don't want to spend the rest of my life looking and feeling like a freak. You're not going to look like a freak, not to me. That is not true, we both know that. Now, this is what I know. I love you and I don't want to lose you. I'm certainly more concerned about your health than how you look in a damn swimsuit. I'll get in touch with Sutton, decide what's best for you. Honey? What is it? Are you okay? Can't do it. I'm completely drained. This can't be pneumonia. It's been weeks. I got to call those doctors today. I want to find out what's up with those tests. I did that. She can't find anything wrong. Thinks it's stress. Which is doctor talk for not taking you seriously. Let's get inside. Come on. David, what's happening to me? Come on, sweetheart. Flap reconstruction? Mom, you just had these Memes taken out and now you're talking about another operation? Honey, we won't do it right away. It's something we're looking into. Want to hear how it's done? No way. I've decided to be a doctor. This week. Girls. They take, um, tissue and muscle from the stomach and funnel it under the skin. I'm out of here. They funnel it under the skin to the chest, where it's formed into breast mounds. So that if it's made from my body, I won't reject them. It's a... A new procedure. But from what I understand, the patients have been pleased. I think you should check it out, Mom. -It sounds really good. -Thank you, sweetie. But I still want to know why I had so much trouble with those implants. Jimmy. Shh! Sorry. Yeah? This is a Pittsburgh cardiologist writing about an implant patient who had fevers and sweats just like me. Yeah. She had swollen joints. She had enlarged kidneys. But she recovered after the implants were removed. Scroll down. It just refers to the manufacturer's warning. Excuse me, the what? It would be included in the shipment box. Why didn't I see it? -Because nobody but you would read it. -Stop. Seriously, I know where to get one. Good. What did you find? Here, take a look at this. -What is it? -Right there. "50% of this doctor's implants after mastectomy had to be replaced." 50%? This is outrageous. Jimmy, why wasn't I warned? I am appalled! Shh! Well, I am. Hi, Mom, what are you reading? The manufacturer's warning that comes with the implants. If women knew... They don't. That's the problem. And you know what else? If you think I had trouble, listen to what happened to these other women. Autoimmune disease... Like scleroderma. Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis... Gosh, I cannot believe that there are doctors who don't say anything. Me either. But I can say something, and I will. What are you going to do? One of the editors of Ms. magazine is a friend of mine. I think that she would like to hear about this. -Louis McClennon? -He just left. Mr. McClennon? Somebody call me? Yes. Thank you. Are you the woman who's writing about the Orphan Drug Bill? No, no, I'm Sybil Goldrich. I'm... I'm doing research on an article about breast implants. They can cause terrible health problems. I'm living proof. I'm not sure how the FDA can help. How can the FDA approve a product with such serious risks? But we haven't. Excuse me? Do you have any idea how many drugs have to be screened by us every year? No, but I bet they're not all available to unsuspecting people like me. Here's the problem. Breast implants aren't a food, they're not a drug. Congress didn't even give us the power to regulate them until '76. That's 15 years ago. And we're getting around to it. Mr. McClennon, there are nearly one million women walking around with these things. What are we supposed to do in the meantime? It's a bureaucracy. It's very slow and I'm sorry about that, but there's really nothing else you can do but wait. Well, that's where you're wrong. If the article were written by a surgeon... But for God sakes, Sybil Goldrich is a Beverly Hills housewife. Who's had severe health problems after implant surgery like me. But she had cancer. You don't. What about the manufacturer's warning? Lawyers make them slap those warnings on there. -They don't mean anything. -It means something to me. It says it can affect your immune system. I've had pneumonia twice, I'm always tired, my joints ache, I trip all the time. Those symptoms could be anything. What does your family doctor say? She can't find anything wrong. Look, before I had implants, I ran six miles before breakfast. Since the implants, I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I want the implants taken out. Kathleen, you're overreacting. It's unnecessary surgery, and I won't do it. Then I'll find someone who will. Wait a minute. Dr. Ness? He's the only plastic surgeon I've never heard of. He's a psychiatrist. Great. You think I'm crazy. Sybil Goldrich, this is Dr. Daniel Shatz. Dan is a member of the university's pathology department. I read your article. Great job. Thank you. All right, let me fill you in on what's going on here. I've come to LA to go over Dan's research on breast implants and the problems that they can cause. In a couple of weeks, the FDA is going to be holding hearings. Dan is going to present his findings to the panel. Findings which support what you've experienced. That's good to know. Now, Dan can represent the scientific community, but we also need a woman with personal experience, a woman like you. -And I know this is very short notice... -I'll be there. Why am I not surprised? - Welcome to the trenches. - Thank you. Hello. Kathleen Anneken? Kentucky? I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. No, not at all. What can I do for you? I just wanted to thank you for your article in the magazine. Before I read it, I thought I was going crazy. See... I've had trouble with my implants, too. Believe me, you're not going crazy. How are you now? Not great. But... I am having one heck of a time trying to talk a surgeon into removing these things. Yeah, I had trouble with that, too. But I bet you didn't have any trouble finding someone to put them in. No, they were more than willing. You know how it is. -Infuriating. -Yeah. How are you doing? I'm fine. I, um, have decided to try flap reconstruction surgery. I'm almost finished, finally. Good for you. Gee, it's... It's really great to talk to someone who knows what this is like. You know, the FDA is holding hearings in Washington in two weeks and they've asked me to speak. I'll be back around the 10th. Why don't you call me then? I'd... I'd like to hear all about it. Thank you. - Any messages for Sybil Goldrich? - Sybil? I'm Kathleen Anneken. How did you... Your husband told me where you'd be staying. - Did he? - Would you, like to have lunch? I know my being here is a surprise. Believe me, it is to me, too. I've never done anything so spontaneous. No? How do you like the hotel? I'm... I'm not staying here. I'm staying at the Douglas, near the airport. Um, well, shall we order? I'm... I'm going to have a hamburger. Think they're any good? I don't eat red meat. -Are you ready to order? -Yes. I'll have the chopped salad, no egg, dressing on the side. And do you have any sparkling water with low sodium? I'll check. And you? The same. I've never been here before. Do you like Washington? I'm disappointed in the shopping. It's not like New York. But it's a nice town. Town. This is huge to me. Of course, you're coming from LA. I've never been that far west. Maybe someday. You must think I'm crazy, showing up like this. I... I didn't book my ticket till the last minute. It really means a lot to me, being here. After lunch, I'm meeting with Louis McClennon from the FDA. You can come along, if you'd like. I sure will. What... What time is the hearing tomorrow? 3:00. I want to try to meet with a Congresswoman after that. You'll want to talk to her, too. She's a cancer survivor like us. I didn't have cancer. You... You didn't have a mastectomy? No. I had implants, because I wanted to look better. Did I say something wrong? Could you bring that order right away, please? Um, no. It's just that I don't have as much time as I thought. And since Louis McClennon isn't expecting you, maybe it's better I see him by myself. I just figured the more people that made noise, the better. Sybil, you're way ahead of me. There's so much I need to learn about this. All right. Daniel Shatz from UCLA is in town. He wants to meet at 5:00, here. Why don't you join us then? Thank you. You know, Memes were supposed to be the solution to capsular contracture. This is what one looks like when it's new. And look at this, patient had this removed after only six months. All the foam is gone. That looks awful. Where did the rest of it go? Great question. Seems it goes into the surrounding breast tissue. Once it's there, it's not easy to remove it, I'll tell you. What happens to the fragments if they're not removed? Well, they can dissolve into a chemical known as toluene diamine, TDA. It's known to cause cancer in animals. In fact, the FDA banned its use in hair dye. But it's okay for breast implants? Great. I've had Meme implants. So basically, what you're saying is, the implants that are used for reconstructive surgery because I had cancer... Can give me cancer again? It's a risk, not a proven fact. But it's a big risk, otherwise you wouldn't be here, right? I guess I better find out what these little bumps are. And the ones just like them on my thigh. -Coffee, please. -Yes, ma'am. - Morning. - Morning. You didn't eat much. I don't have much of an appetite these days. And as they say, there's always an upside. Are you okay? I was real worried about you last night with those little bumps and all. I'm dealing with it. Well, better than I would. Hey, I've been sitting here making some notes. I thought we could start a newsletter. We could do it together. We could call it Command. For Cosmetic Operation Mishaps. Do you have any non-fat milk? Thank you. So, what do you think of the title? Actually, I'm starting one myself. Truth in Reconstruction, Understanding Surgical Techniques, TRUST for short. How about something in between? To be honest with you, I haven't considered aligning myself with women who have had implants for purely cosmetic reasons. I get it... You're the good victim. And I'm the bad victim. That's not what I said. Sure it is. You know, you remind me of folks who divide people with AIDS into two categories. The guilty ones because they're gay, and the innocent ones like hemophiliacs, because they've had transfusions. That's really not what I meant. Look, I can admit I had implants because I wanted to feel good about myself, but so did you. I think there is a difference. I had cancer. I had lost something. And I'm sorry. But we both chose to have implants. Kathleen, I don't know what I would say in a newsletter to women like you. You were perfectly healthy. I... I was. But we were both misled. I'll see you at the hearing. The problem, gentlemen, is... When implants rupture or leak, silicone gets into the bloodstream, and is carried to the thyroid glands, the ovaries... -Excuse me, Dr. Shatz. -If I may finish... Are you suggesting that silicone is anything but inert? -Hi, how are you doing? -I was fine. Silicone can trigger the immune system. So it produces antibodies which attack itself as well as other parts of the body. Unfortunately, because the outer covering of the Meme implant breaks down, it doesn't fare any better. - Dr. Shatz... - How about a dry run? ...I find your comments overstating, if not highly inflammatory. Who is the man with the bow tie? That's Vincent Koch. He's a lawyer from Dow Corning. Boy. -I'd like to get a shot at him. -You'll get your chance. ...when implants rupture or leak, silicone... I thought that I would tell them that I questioned the surgeons thoroughly about the reliability of the implants, but since I had no idea that they came with a manufacturer's warning, how could I ask to read it, something like that. That's good. I'd like to assure you, ma'am, that Daniel Shatz, distinguished as he may be, doesn't know what he's talking about. With all due respect, Mr. Koch, I believe he knows exactly what he's talking about, because I'm exactly one of the women he's describing. Mrs. Anneken, I sympathize with your physical discomfort, but surely you can understand that unsubstantiated charges by one... Excuse me. If I may, Kathleen. -Mr. Koch, is it? -Yeah. Sybil Goldrich. You may have read a recent article of mine. Or if not, I'd... I'd like to send it to you. When you do read it, you'll learn that Kathleen is just one of an untold number of women, myself included, who have had negative reactions to these implants. Ladies, you're going to have to excuse me. -That pompous ass. -There's a lot of those around here. Did I look like I needed the cavalry? Well, yes, I thought you were going to collapse. Maybe so, but I don't recall asking you to come to the rescue. Look, Sybil, I came here because I have to find out what's happening to me. And if you don't like who I am or what I've done, that's your problem. But I'll tell you one thing, I am not leaving Washington without answers. Sybil, you're up next. - We'll talk later. - I'll check my schedule. But I refute Daniel Shatz's testimony. That's Paul Cadets, he's a big-wheel surgeon. If, and I say if, silicone travels, it's harmless. It's picked up by the lymph system and excreted or stored. There is no, and I repeat, no medical proof that links silicone to immune system ailments. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Cadets. Mrs. Sybil Goldrich. Gentlemen, thank you for inviting me here to speak. Um... For me, implant surgery was one way of reclaiming my body after a mastectomy. Unfortunately, my body rejected both the silicone implants and the Meme replacements. As if once wasn't enough, I've now lost my breast three times. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Though I... I asked many questions prior to my surgery, I was not informed of the manufacturer's warning that comes with the implants. Had I known of the risks, I may have made a different choice. -Mrs. Goldrich. -Yes. Is it your opinion that silicone implants should be removed from the market? For whatever reason a woman chooses to have implants, she must be told they do not have FDA approval. They are not necessarily safe and they could ruin her health. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Goldrich. We'll take a 10-minute break. I just hope they heard that. Well, I did. So, now what? I'd say it's about time we paid a visit to a few members of Congress. Here, you take half this list. I'm sorry, Congresswoman Brenner is unavailable. We need 10 minutes at the most. You'd be wasting your time. The Congresswoman doesn't agree with your position that breast implants be taken off the market. -Well, that's not my position. -Mine either. We just want to make sure that women are informed of the dangers involved. Thanks for your help. Let me get this straight, she doesn't have time to listen to us, but she's got time to listen to Dr. Slick here who gives her a line of baloney? -Excuse me. -No, I will not excuse you or anybody else who participates in this whitewash. Can we go before we get arrested? -All right, we'll go. For now. -Sybil... If you ask me, the big boys are nervous. Otherwise, why send a heavy hitter like Koch here, and why have Cadets buttonholing Congress people? You might be on to something. We just need to keep the pressure turned up, especially from the private sector. Which reminds me, that FDA panel has a seat for a consumer representative and it's vacant. We could appoint Sybil. No, she's not eligible unless she represents an organization. Actually, we do. It's called Command Trust... Network. Kathleen's the president. I'm the vice-president. Well, then, it's settled. Thanks for taking me to breakfast. You didn't have to spring for a limo, too. Yeah, I think maybe I owe you. So... What are we going to put in our newsletter? Well, maybe we should each write an article, from our own point of view, about what happened. Okay. And... I'll contact other women's groups and see if they'll lend their mailing list. That's a good idea. And let me know when you find a surgeon to remove those implants. If I do. You will. And call after a doctor checks those little bumps on your wrist. All right. So I guess... Take care. You, too. The nodules are non-cancerous tumors. I suppose they could have been caused by the silicone, since it leaked into your system when the implants ruptured. My implants ruptured? Why wasn't I told? I have no idea. It's here in your chart. It took the surgeon two hours to clean the gel off your chest wall. Do you believe that? Now I find out that I could have silicone flying around in my body and I can't do anything. Those damn doctors. Right. She doesn't mean you, Dad. Who's she talking to? One guess. Yeah. So you keep looking for a surgeon, Kathleen, and don't let them give you the party line about silicone being inert. Actually, I think I've found one who's agreed to talk to me about having the implants removed. I... I'm seeing him tomorrow. Well, that's wonderful, Kathleen. What, honey? - Forgot to give this to you. - Thank you. Kathleen, did you read the paper today? Listen to this. "A jury found in favor yesterday of a woman suing Dow Corning." She claimed her implants were the cause of an autoimmune disease. My goodness. What? She was awarded $1.7 million. The judge upheld the jury's finding that Dow Corning committed fraud. What's the attorney's name? A Joshua Norton, and he lives here. Sybil, be gentle. I know. I know. I know. I'll call you as soon as I've cornered him. Bye-bye. Xena, this is fantastic, darling. - Thank you. - You're welcome. How was practice? It was okay. Brad... I saw your face when I mentioned having the implants removed. It's no big deal. Brad. Okay. I... I guess I don't know why you had them in in the first place. Remember the beginning of last season, when you had to have the new high-tops, 'cause the old ones didn't look so good? Maybe it's not so different for me. Mom, I didn't have my new high-tops surgically attached to my feet. So, I'm in the mood for a cheap escapist thriller. Anybody with me? -No chainsaws. -Spoilsport. -Sybil, you in? -No, go ahead. I want to try and finish this newsletter and I'd like to see if I can get a hold of this Joshua Norton's telephone number tonight if possible. -Can't it wait? -Yeah, Mom. It can, but it won't. Go ahead. You don't need me to have fun. Go. Okay, it's your loss. I'll get my coat. Sybil... -What's going on? -Nothing. I just don't want to go to a movie. Jimmy, don't over-analyze everything. I'm not. I'm just... Never mind. -I'll see you later. -Okay. And I'm an oncologist, not a plastic surgeon. I know, but none of the plastic surgeons would help. To do so could give credence to your argument that the implants have caused your illness. This isn't about what they think, this is about what I want. Your symptoms may not go away. I'm willing to take that chance. You had the implants for cosmetic reasons. Do you understand how your breasts will appear without them? Yes. Why don't we do a mammogram to see if the implants have ruptured? Thank you, Dr. Warren. I haven't agreed to perform the surgery yet. I know. But you're the first surgeon who's listened to me in a long time. Sorry to make you eat on the run, but I'm due in court. No problem. Um, do you have any salads? Um... So, Mr. Norton how did you convince a jury that Dow Corning committed fraud? Well, Dow said their implants were safe. The only thing wrong with that is, their own documents suggest otherwise. What documents? I got the court to order Dow to give me the files. I saw stuff going back 20 years. We hit the jackpot. I'd like copies. Can't. I can't even tell you what's in 'em. That's one of the conditions of them giving me access in the first place. So the information exists, but I can't have it? That's what I'm saying. Then I'd say Dow Corning's in for a rude awakening. I'd say you're in for a fight. I got to run, sorry. And so, if what Michael Norton says is true, and we can assume that it is since his client was awarded over a million bucks, how do these guys at Dow Corning sleep at night? They sleep just fine, Sybil. Dow is like any other corporate entity. Their board answers to the stockholders. - Not to do so would be in breach of... - Jimmy. How can you defend these people? - I'm not. - Yes, you are. Xena, pass the dressing. We have this conversation every night. Can we give it a rest? Hear, hear. Sorry I'm boring you. You're not, but... That's not what I said. Every time we're together, we talk about implants. You're becoming obsessed. How can you say that to me? Let the machine get it. I'll get it. My God. What are you doing? Is it too much to ask to have a... A normal dinner with my family? Because if it is, I'll go down the street to get a burger. Fine. Jimmy, leave. Why not? That's right, why not? You do it all the time. This work has taken over our whole lives. And I'm very sorry that you don't see it as important. Kathleen was supposed to have her implants out today. Then get it. Thank you. Hello. Hi, Sybil, it's me. I hope I didn't... Catch me at a bad time? No, not at all. I'm glad you called. Are you all right? Well... Well, I had my implants out, like I wanted. And just now, I was thinking about junior high. I was so skinny. The boys used to say I should hire myself out as an ironing board. Kathleen. God, Sybil, they'd all laugh. You don't need to tough this out. Yeah, I think I do. I shouldn't... ...have cared so much about what they thought, but I did. And now, here I am. So many years later, and it's like... It's like I'm less than zero. What happened was not your fault. Now I know what you must have felt like after your mastectomy. I would give anything for you not to know that. Before I forget, um... We have four new members of Command Trust. Three women, and a transsexual from San Francisco. We'll talk later, okay? You can count on it. Bye. Honey, please. Please don't shut me out. Okay? I can't help it. I feel so unlovable. No, you're not. Not to me, you could never be to me. Sweetheart... I just want to hold you. All right? We'll take it slow. I just want to hold you tonight. It's going to be all right. It is all right. Celia and Rich want us to go to opening night of the ball. Sounds okay. We need to talk. Indeed we do. Connie Chung's office phoned me. They're interested in an interview. Actually, no, it's more than that. They... They want to show pictures of my breasts after they became infected and disfigured. And you said yes? No, I said I wanted to discuss it with my husband. And what would you do if I said I'd rather you not do that? Is that what you're saying? No, no, I'm asking you a direct question. If I'd rather you wouldn't do that... I heard you the first time. Jimmy, this work that I'm doing is very important to me. It helps me cope. You talked to the girls? Xena's fine. Amy has never much understood why her mother is so out there. That's a direct quote. I wish that you did. You're beginning to treat my involvement with this like it's an inconvenience, -like it is just another fundraiser. -Sybil, do what you want. Damn it, Jimmy, this is about spending what time I have in a meaningful way. The children and I had hoped that you would spend that time with us. Wait a minute. Sybil, this work that you're doing helps you cope, that's fine. -But for me, it's just a reminder. -Of what? Of how I let you down. Doesn't it ever occur to you that I might feel responsible for all this? You didn't know what was going to happen any more than I did. -We both asked questions. -I'm a doctor. I hear you bad-mouth doctors all the time on the phone to Kathleen. Don't you think I hear that? I don't blame you. -Don't you? -No, of course not. The choices were mine. You're a good doctor. More than that, you're a good man. And you would never ever let one of your patients make the choices that I made without a full understanding of the risks involved, and I know that. You're sure? You're sure you're sure? Three points, Daddy. That was lame. Yeah, smart girl? Show me what you got. Sitting there in the sidelines, making noise. Come on. Three points, Mom. Come on. Go ahead. I dare you. Mommy! Yes! Hey, she's back. Amy! Mom's show's on. Sybil Goldrich received implants after a double mastectomy. You didn't set the VCR? No, no, no, the resident technician did it. Although implants have been on the market for three decades. Look, Mom, it's you. - This is your fantasy? - I look fat. TV adds 10 pounds. Now you tell me. You're beautiful. There are over 300 implant operations done every day in this country. Women who choose this surgery must be given a copy of the manufacturer's warning that comes with the product. Had I been given more information, at least I could have made an informed choice. Mrs. Goldrich gave us permission to show this graphic and shocking photo that illustrates the extent of her disfigurement after five implant operations. Like many women, numerous operations left my breasts... -Forget about it. -...disfigured and infected. Amy? Amy! And all this time, the FDA has never approved them. Just as I say that I believe implants are harmful, the drug companies and manufacturers have no proof that they're not. Amy? I want to talk. After tonight, you said it all, Mom. Amy, you may as well give up. You know how persistent I am. I don't have time for this. Well, make time. You've been grousing at me for months, and I've left you alone. It's fine with me. What's bothering you? You don't want to know. Yes, I do. Nobody cares more about you than I do. Amy, what do you want? I want to be left alone. I don't believe you. Okay, don't believe me. Doesn't matter what I think anyway. It matters to me. What do you want me to say, Mother? That I approve of you showing your breasts all over national TV? Well, I don't. Okay? It is the most repulsive thing I've ever seen in my life. Where is your self-respect? You want to know the truth? You disgust me, okay? Are you happy now? This is so humiliating. I'm just so scared all the time, if the cancer is... Amy. We're pretty sure the cancer is gone. And I'm taking the tests. Cancer runs in families, Mom. You know, sometimes I think it's not a matter of if I'm going to get it, but when. Honey, why didn't you talk to me about this sooner? Because there's nothing you can do about it. Amy... Just because I had cancer doesn't mean that you and Xena will. My mother didn't have breast cancer, neither did my grandmother. Mom, telling me not to worry is not going to make what I'm feeling go away. You're right. Amy, whatever you choose to think, don't ever be afraid to know what's going on inside your own body. I have to finish this paper. You should know this, I'm going to Washington again. I've been asked to testify before a House Subcommittee. They're finally looking into just how safe implants are. Or aren't. Like Congress actually cares. Kathleen and I have gotten the word out. There's a lot of other women who are demanding the truth. So you see, your mother isn't the only woman out there who has a big mouth. I guess... I guess that's one trait I could stand to inherit, since I want to be a lawyer, right? Yes, you could. Mom? Knock 'em dead. No, I know. Well, listen, you let us know if you want any more information. Sure, bye. - Hey, I'll get it, Mom. - Okay. You know what to say? Yeah, I got plenty to say. Hello? This is Command Trust. Yeah, I saw the show, too. Really? It happened to you, too? Would you like us to send you some information? What happened? - Yeah, can I... - Is everybody all right? - Well, sure. - "Well, sure"? Kathleen, I've been trying to call for two hours, the phone has been busy. I'm sorry, honey, I told you Sybil's TV interview was on last night. Producers gave our phone number as a reference, and I guess the program hit a nerve. Let it ring. Dad, it might be one of those women who needs information. Then answer it. Hello? What did you have to tell me that was so important? No, that's not the point, Kathleen. I couldn't get through to my own home. David, when you opened your accounting firm, you were on the phone 10 hours a day. Why can't I get the same consideration? When are things going to get back to normal around here? The only way I can live with this is to make sure other women won't go through what I have, what we have. And if you're going to live with me, you're going to have to live with that decision. Well, I guess there's just one thing left for me to do, then. I'm going to have to put in another phone line? All right, Dad. What else am I going to do? You got me double-teamed here. And I've had three autoimmune diseases. Just never occurred to me that the implants had anything to do with it until my surgeon discovered that mine had ruptured. Took five hours to clean up the silicone in my chest cavity. But who knows where else it spread. Sounds all too familiar. What can I do for you? This may be insane. But I want to take on Dow Corning. Now, the thing is, I need the right lawyer, and I thought you would know of someone. Yes, I do. His name is Joshua Norton. He's done it before. He's the best there is. I have his number in my car. - Thank you, Sybil. - Thank you, Joan. You keep in touch with me, you let me know how it's going. -All right? -You bet. Let's get it. How many on this Subcommittee? Eight. But they won't all show up. Well, I bet they would if this were about penile implants. What we need is a hot piece on the 6:00 news or something in the Washington Post. This really is all about politics, isn't it? And then some. Did I miss anything? Kathleen. How good to see you. - Good to see you, too. - You look great. -Thank you. Hi. How are you? -Kathleen, hi. Mr. Koch? Mr. Koch? Sybil Goldrich. How does it feel to know that Dow Corning has internal documents that suggest the implants might not be safe? Excuse me, Mrs. Goldrich, I don't know what you're talking about. Well, you must be aware of the $1.7 million settlement that the court ordered Dow to pay that woman. Mrs. Goldrich, I really think this conversation is inappropriate, in light of your newsletter which encourages readers to sue Dow Corning. We're not encouraging anyone to sue. However, we do offer guidance as to how to select a lawyer in case any of our readers feel they need one. Excuse me. Sybil... There, might be a more diplomatic way of handling him. Come on, Kathleen, that man won't even admit there was a settlement. Look, we want information, we're not going to get it by bulldozing him or anybody else like him. Excuse me, I have to get ready. -I'll grab a seat. -I'll be right there. -Kathleen, could I talk to you first? -Sure. I, um... I hope you know what a good job I think Command Trust is doing. Thank you. And when I say what I'm about to say, know also that I have the greatest admiration for Sybil and for everything that she's accomplished. But... We, um... We are starting a new advisory panel. And I would very much like to see the Command Trust Network have a voice on it. Now, Sybil... Sybil's a little hard, so... But would you consider taking that position? Maybe. Tell me more. Well, we're going to require that manufacturers of implants submit detailed reports showing us that they can minimize the risks. And then in a few months, the panel will meet again, and they'll go over all the findings. What if the manufacturers can't comply? Well, it's possible the FDA would recommend pulling the implants off the market. This is serious. You bet. I've already talked to the administrators about you. I like your style. You're tough, but you listen. Now, you'll be the consumer representative. It's a non-voting position, but it's a lot of work. -Count me in. -I was hoping you'd say that. Over the last few months, I've not had any recurrence of cancer. But what will happen from the silicone that is still in my body? I shudder when I think about it. Thank you. I think that ought to satisfy her. Let's go. You see, the thing that bothers me is that, here we have a history of the FDA dragging its feet on problems that its own scientists have identified as being very serious. And I don't understand that. The FDA is not in the business to kowtow to plastic surgeons, or manufacturers, or to anybody else. You are here to protect the well-being of the American public. Yeah, I'm happy that Command Trust has a seat on the panel. -But unhappy McClennon asked me. -No. All I'm saying is after Weiss' speech today, the FDA is going to feel pressure from all sides. Don't let them off the hook. I might not be as outspoken as you, Sybil, but I'm not a pushover. Kathleen, come here. What? Somebody's rearranged my things. And I'm sure I didn't leave this medicine bag open. Could somebody have gone through this? Maybe they were after my mailing lists. It could be. It could be, yeah. Of course, it could have been a stray dog. In my hotel room in Washington, a stray dog went through my medicine bag. Sybil, you would not be the first hotel guest to have a maid rifle through her things. Don't you think it's a bit coincidental? Okay. Okay, we will padlock the garbage cans and get you a paper shredder. -It's not funny. -Not at all. Think the neighbors would mind the machine gun turrets? Come on, Sybil, get a grip. Honey, you said you were coming to bed about three hours ago. -It's 2:00 AM, you know. -I know. I got to get through these so I can turn in my recommendations. Panel meets in Washington again next week. Already? What is all this stuff? Remember I told you the FDA is requiring all implant manufacturers to submit documents proving their safety? Right. Well, these are the documents. I guess that kind of fits into the category of, "be careful what you ask for," No kidding. Dow Corning is only one of dozens of companies making these things, and they all sent reports. At least they complied. Can I help you? I wish you could, honey. It's the thought that counts. Yeah. Kathleen. Hi, there. Kathleen, hi. Good to see you. Let me take your bag for you. - Thanks. Have you seen Sybil yet? - I did, I did. She got on an elevator followed by two bellhops and a load of luggage. So, how's it going for you? Well, I'm starting to understand the plight of an overburdened government employee, you have my condolences. Actually, I didn't expect to see you here. Well, I'm... I'm not here officially. Let's, um... Let's move out of the traffic here. I don't understand how these companies, especially the big ones like Dow, keep track of their own paperwork. They don't. This is marked confidential. You didn't get it from me. I have to talk to you, but not here. -Hello to you, too. -Come on. What's gotten into you? -Perfect. -What? And you thought I was paranoid. Louis gave me this. "Dow Corning's strategy notes." -Good show. -Keep reading. An enemies list. I thought this went out with Nixon. My God. This is great. Great? Are you insane? No, I am flattered. I love this. Dow Corning considers us enemies. I think I'll frame this. Doesn't this make you just a little bit nervous? No, of course not. Well, okay, a little bit. But this is it. This is what we've been waiting for. We've got them, we've really got them going. I can't wait to see their faces when they have to pull those implants off the market. Lot of people here, don't you think? I hear they flew in over 400 women. Who? The Plastic Surgeons Association. I'm from Dallas. I'm... I'm from Beverly Hills. I'll see you inside, Sybil. Excuse me. You are Sybil Goldrich, aren't you? Yes, I am. I was hoping to run into you. Do you know you've been scaring the hell out of women? I know that I've been giving women information they're not getting anywhere else. Here, you listen to me, I had cancer, and after all the surgery and the chemo, getting implants was the one good thing that happened to me. I can look at myself in the mirror and not see a cancer victim staring back. Other women should have the same opportunity. Absolutely they should, as long as the implants are safe. They are safe. Do you see any one of us complaining? Well, good for you, but there are a lot of women, myself included, for whom it was a complete disaster. Do you know that silicone could be bleeding into your body? Do you know that your implants can become hardened and infected? What are we supposed to do? Live with flat chests and mastectomy scars? No, but there are other safer alternatives. Um, flap reconstruction, for one. I've had it. At $35,000? Do you think everyone lives in Beverly Hills? No. There are other alternatives, saline, for example. They'd flatten out. You don't speak for me, Sybil. And you don't speak for the majority of women who have implants. We are thrilled. - Excuse me. Sybil, we have to go. - All right. No, wait, wait, wait a minute. Do you realize that plastic surgeons make $450 million a year on implants that are not approved? This does not communicate to me that they are protecting our health. They are protecting that bounty. Sybil. And it is the conclusion of this panel that manufacturers at this time have not proven that silicone breast implants are safe. However... Ladies and gentlemen... Please. Thank you. However, we feel the implants serve a public health need. We're asking the FDA Commissioner to leave the implants on the market while additional data is collected. In the meantime, we urge physicians to explain to women that safety concerns have not been solved. Implants are not risk-free. Women need to know this, so that they can give informed consent. We had the manufacturers on the run. Why did you let the panel back down? Sybil, I'm not a voting member. You should have spoken up more. I spoke for informed consent, which is what we've been fighting for. Don't you get it? The FDA is urging physicians to tell women of the risks. Nobody says they have to, by law. This panel can't change the law! No, but it could have recommended that the implants be taken off the market. Instead, you let them off the hook and now we're right back where we started. I think you're overreacting. Kathleen. Did you see the women in the audience? The ones who were flown in to lobby for implants. Yes, Sybil, I did. And those women have a right to have implants as long as they know the risks. But they don't. That's the point! These companies are playing politics in order to keep from exposing everything that they know. The only person on this planet who seems to grasp this is Joshua Norton, and he's the only one who's managed to dig deep enough. Maybe you should be working with him. Maybe I should. Let me ask you something. If your implants had worked, whose side would you be on right now? I'd still want to know the risks. Now where? McClennon's office. Before we leave, I'd like to see if there's any way to undo some of the damage that was done here today. Moving to better digs? Sybil, Kathleen, hi. I'm glad you stopped by. Um, this will be better coming from me. Some of my colleagues feel that I've allowed myself to get too close to Command Trust, and, um, so I'm being transferred. Effective immediately. -Kathleen, welcome to California. -Thank you, Jimmy. It's so good to finally meet you in person. You, too. I'll take that. Thank you. Come on in. Your house is gorgeous. Thank you. Sybil should be back in a few minutes. I hear Washington was rough this time. We were almost down for the count. Never seen Sybil so angry. Good thing that doesn't happen very often. Sybil was really happy you decided to change your mind and come out here. Meeting Joshua Norton is important, so I wanted to be here. Excuse me. Girls! Girls! Coming. - Hi. - Hi. Girls, this is Kathleen Anneken. I'm Xena. Your mom talks about you all the time. That's scary. Hi! Turn on the TV, quick. Celia called me on the car phone. I'm so glad you're here. -Me, too. -Come on. Joan Brouchet sued Dow Corning claiming her implants ruptured, leaving her with painful medical problems. The jury awarded her $7.3 million. Dow Corning's attorney Vincent Koch called the jury's verdict outrageous. Look, there's Koch. Mrs. Brouchet's attorney, Joshua Norton, disagrees. The jury has sent Dow Corning a message, "You cannot sacrifice the health of women to enhance your balance sheet." - Excuse us. - Are you satisfied with that? Yes, we are. Thank you very much. Norton used Dow Corning's own documents to discredit the company's case. Boy, would I like to get a hold of those documents. Do you ever eat sitting down? You know what they say, "You snooze, you lose." I thought I would see you yesterday. What happened? The verdict came out at what time, 4:00? I know. I expected to see Sybil camped outside my office door. Very funny. If the FDA Commissioner saw those documents, he may pull the plug on implants once and for all. You know I'm bound by a court order. But just think about the women whose lives would be changed. Sybil, you really want to see me in prison? 'Cause that's where I'll be if the judge were to find me in contempt. Not to mention, putting my license on the line. This isn't just about you. And this isn't just your fight, Sybil. I've worked for years on these cases. Don't tell me I don't care. The FDA knows how I won those cases. Now why aren't they asking the tough questions, with all these hearings you're going to all the time? What should we do now? Well, if I were you, I'd think about filing a class action suit. So the lawyers make lots of money after about a zillion years of litigation. One way to go. Who knows? Shake enough people up, maybe somebody on the inside will pass you the information. The real truth, it takes all of us going at it from all the angles. And I know you don't want to hear this, but it takes time. I got to go. This is my son Brad. He's cute. Yeah. Next time bring him out. Maybe we should file a class action suit. What do you think, Jim? Have you noticed my wife has a one-track mind? No, does she? I like this. You didn't finish your joke. Hello. I'm looking for Command Trust. Is this Sybil Goldrich? Yes, it is. Who is this? I worked for the Razon Corporation. Do you know what that is? Well, among other things, Razon manufactures implants. Is there... Something that I can do for you? I don't want to talk on the phone. Can you meet me somewhere? Tomorrow? I don't like this. It is a little cloak-and-dagger. We're just going to talk. Make sure you're both there at all times. And meet publicly, preferably in front of a police station. Now who's paranoid? This guy could be a real nutcase. Jimmy, he's fine. He's just a little nervous. Look, I got to go. Will you call me as soon... ...as you get home, immediately? Did he say what he'd be wearing or what he looked like? Tall, light hair, light eyes. Well, that narrows it down. Mr. Ivey? Sybil Goldrich. This is Kathleen Anneken. -Hi. -Nice to meet you. I'm... I'm nervous about this. You should've seen my husband. What did you do for Razon? Consumer affairs. I'd handle calls from women whose implants had ruptured. These were women who couldn't afford replacements, so surgeons would have them call us, to see if the company would do something. And did it? We were told to say we'd never had any complaints before, which is a lie. Then the company would agree to replace the implants, as long as the women signed releases protecting us from lawsuits. And they signed? Yes. I didn't want to make a fuss, but... After a while, I just felt too bad about what the company was making me say to these women, so I quit. Mr. Ivey, with your help, we could tell your story to our 15,000 women on our mailing list. Come on, Dave. Make a little fuss. Command Trust Network. Sybil? Yeah, I'm writing Dave's story right now. Where? CNN? Hold on, let me turn it on. ...about the implants that amplifies our concerns about their safety. Therefore I'm asking physicians to cease using gel implants. -As physicians... -Yes! ...our first obligation is to do no harm. I'm also asking manufacturers to stop distributing these products during this period. Did you hear that? Do you think Joshua Norton gave him those papers? I don't know. We still do not know how often the implants leak... -Thanks for that. -You're welcome. -See you tomorrow. -Any time. You turned those documents over to the FDA Commissioner. Did he say that? No, but how else could he have them? You got me. You may not hold lawyers in high regard, Sybil, but some of us actually do believe in obeying the law. That's right, and I do hold some lawyers in high regard, like you. When will the documents be made public? My estimation, a couple of weeks. Wish I didn't have to wait. You are one persistent woman. Okay. The documents are letters from plastic surgeons, writing to Dow, complaining about implant ruptures, leaks and so on. There were memos from Dow's own scientists, pleading with the company to conduct safety studies. Let me guess, Dow Corning stonewalled? Pretty much. They put off the safety studies, and the studies they did conduct were ludicrous. They put mini implants into dogs, then published an article saying there was no problem. Dogs? We don't even rate primates. Guess not. But get this, within a year, one of the dogs died, and the other three were in bad shape. What's going to happen when this information hits the streets? I don't think there's any question. Dow will be buried in litigation. And sure, class action suit will be filed. But will any of the women who deserve the compensation see the money? Sybil, if you have anything to say about it, and I'm sure you will, those women will be fine. -Good luck. -Thank you. Just remember, we're here to find out who's eligible for the class action lawsuit, that's all, okay? Act like I'm going to start a riot or something, why don't you? Your Honor, many of the plaintiffs, especially those in financial difficulty, turned to the manufacturer for help. And they were adequately compensated by the manufacturers, Your Honor. There's no need to include them in this suit. Mr. Koch, compensation alone is not going to exclude these women from a class action suit, you should know that. Ms. Fleming, what would it cost a woman to remove and replace ruptured implants? Um... Do we have these figures? No. Your Honor, I don't have the exact figure in front of me at the moment. If I may, Your Honor, about $4,000. No way. -Sybil, give the lawyers a chance. -All right, all right. Fine. If women received $4,000 or less from the manufacturers, we'll say they can participate in the settlement. If they received more than the ceiling amount, they are excluded. Excuse me, Your Honor. And who are you? Sybil Goldrich, Command Trust. The standard fee for implant removal is $5,000, but that is before anesthesia and additional care. So, the ceiling, in my opinion, should be at least $10,000. Your Honor, please. Raising the ceiling is going to add many more women to the settlement. No, no, no. That's not my concern at this point. If Ms. Goldrich is correct in her figures, and incidentally, it would behoove plaintiff's attorneys to confirm these numbers, then $10,000 it will be. There's an advisory committee for the class action suit, right? To help determine the monetary award. We want to be on it. No, it's limited to attorneys. None of you knew the price of implant surgery. I mean, where would we be if Sybil hadn't spoken up? Okay. But do me a favor, will you? The next time you sit in on a proceeding, just pass me a note. Don't go off like a loose cannon. Well, I don't have any problem with that. Okay. And if you believe that, I've got some nice swampland in Florida. God, I love New York! Even the street vendors are, I don't know, special. -Do you have 50 cents? -Allow me. Is this your idea of a payoff? I'll have a regular coffee, please. Well, you ladies won a minor skirmish today in a long, very long war. A war you seem to be losing. If you count the courts, the press, public opinion, and, yes, the scientific community. It's a funny thing about public opinion. It can turn on a dime, so can the press. You can ask any politician. Courts, well, they reverse their opinions every day. Thank you. And as for the so-called scientific community, hell, we have a staff full of scientists. What's that supposed to mean? It means that that dollar is the only money you're ever going to see from Dow. Have a nice day. What are you thinking? Nothing that's legal. You know, the problem with this whole thing is that women have been kept from hearing the truth about implants, and here we are, barred from hearing the judge's decision first-hand. I know. It's unfair. I'm hungry. You hungry? Lord, no. I am too keyed up to eat. I could go for a chopped salad. With dressing on the side? Do you think if we met under different circumstances, we'd still be friends? I don't know. I do know that if I had to do it all over again, it's the one thing that I would never change. Me either. -Sybil Goldrich? -Yes. I'm Anne Connor. - Have we met? - Not officially. I'm the one who confronted you at the FDA hearing. The one who said, "You don't speak for me." Yes, Anne, how could I forget you? This is Kathleen Anneken. -How do you do? -Hello. So, what brings you to New York? The class action suit. And I was hoping for a chance to apologize to you. About a year after we met, one of my implants ruptured. So I guess you really do speak for me after all. Anyway, I'm sorry. So am I. I really am. I'm very sorry, Anne. Thank you. -We did it. -What? We got an agreement. For breast implant victims, $4.2 billion. Yeah, Dow Corning's got to pay about half of it, about $2 billion. Looks to be the largest class action settlement in history. Yeah. There have been many changes since I last testified here. Many of you are critical of the FDA's moratorium on silicone implants. But I speak to you as a cancer patient. I survived my cancer, but I have been continually plagued with problems arising from the silicone implants I used for my breast reconstruction. My medical records describe me as an implant failure. I do not accept that description. The implants failed me. Thirty years after the release of breast implants on the market, there are still no valid scientific studies to prove the product's safe. Not proven unsafe, not proven ineffective, is not the standard, never was the standard, should never be the standard. The rule to be proven safe must never be altered. We are, all of us, entitled to that safeguard. Thank you.
