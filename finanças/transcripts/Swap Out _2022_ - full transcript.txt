So if you can set up a Zoom call for Friday, well, actually remember I told you those people was coming over the house? Yeah, man. It's already going left, but set up a Zoom call. And if I need to get outta the house for it, I will. But like I said, the Langley case is moving forward so we're good to go. And this might be a two, three month shutdown.

This is what I was talking about, right here. - [Announcer] From four state governors as the coronavirus pandemic spreads, New York, California, Illinois, and Connecticut, all ordering non-essential employees to stay home. Those orders cover 75 million people. - You get to stay home, more time with me. - Well, that won't be such a bad thing. Damn. - Zero. Where this virus come from? 75 million Americans ordered to stay home. Look, civil fines, mandatory closure for businesses that are not in compliance. So they gonna shut you down 'cause you're not like compliance? - Yes. They're gonna shut you down if you're not in compliance with the order, you can't do that. There's too many people in this country. - Listen, they're gonna figure a way out. We're in America. - Look, president Trump. Look, look. - He's so annoying. - And you know the Republicans ain't going for that. They are not gonna miss money. The Republicans, they ain't shutting down. They ain't missing no money for nobody. Now the Democrats on the other hand, they more people like. So we gonna see. 75 million Americans ordered to stay home as cases grow. Come on now. I mean, it's just nonsense. - At the end of the day. - I'm tired of that stuff. - We have to make sure that we're stocked up. So I gotta go get some water, gotta stock up the pantries, stock up the fridge. - Get some tissue. (both laugh) - I'll get some tissue. Oh Lord and baby wipes. - Get everything, I tell you what though. - And snacks. - Ain't nothing going happen. How you gonna shut down a whole country for a virus? It's like the flu, if you ain't shut it down for the flu, we all catch the flu. We get little shots. What if they come out with a vaccine? - I'm not taking it and you ain't either if you wanna stay married to me. - You know, I ain't taking no vaccine. - You better not. - Nah, but I need to call Chad because we got a lot of stuff going on with this case at the office though. - Like what? - It's a lot. I mean, if they're ordering people to stay home, I think I need to jump on top of it because I mean, we could joke about it, but I gotta take it serious because I got this big case. You see, New York was on TV, right? - Yes. - Now if that trial goes to New York, you know what happens? He might get extradited and we have to go to New York. - I'm not going to no New York. - No, no, no, you gonna stay right here.
