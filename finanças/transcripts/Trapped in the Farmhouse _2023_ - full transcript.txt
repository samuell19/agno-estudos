Cooking like this, how could I say no? You know, I can't imagine how hard That must have been on you and your daughter. I'd say the worst part was the suddenness. Never having a chance to say goodbye. Can I ask what happened? It was just a car accident. It was over quickly. No pain, they said. It's been really hard on kylie, but... -She's a trooper. -[chuckles] Just like her mother. Listen to me blathering, It's just... I don't get a lot of people to talk to. Right. Besides your daughter. Right. [thuds] Um...These old houses. They say they don't make 'em like they used to. Well, I say there's probably a reason for that. Right. Ready for seconds? No, I couldn't. Um, besides, I don't feel like Having to run an extra five miles tomorrow. Why do you have to do that? Oh. It's just something that my-my boyfriend bryan would say Anytime I splurged and be like, "that's a five-miler." Sounds like a real charmer. Yeah, that's one word for him. So, uh... How long you two been together? Um, we were together for three years. -Were? -Uh-hmm. Like you said, charmer. Better late than never, I suppose. What do you mean? You know what I think? I think you were with him because it was safe. I bet deep down, you knew he wasn't right for you. You just weren't ready to admit it to yourself. Am I right? -Actually, it's-- -[noises upstairs] Would you excuse me? -I'll just be a sec. -Yeah, sure. [footsteps] Wind's really did a number on the roof. I have to patch it up in the morning. -Hmm. -All done? Stuffed. Thank you. Uh... Why don't you, uh, go to the living room And see if there's an update on the weather. Okay.

[newscaster] appears to be a cell Forming close to the ground. It's difficult to see what's going on, If there's definitely A possibility of this forming into a strong funnel cloud. We will continue to monitor this and other spots Where we are concerned about additional tornadoes forming. As you know, central and southern texas Is no stranger to extreme weather. From earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods to ice storms. So what can you do to prepare? First, it's important to stay informed. Watch the news, listen to the radio, Follow your local emergency [indistinct] On social media [indistinct] by following [indistinct] [jack] got anything? Weather? Oh, um...Uh-uh. [newscaster] ...Between hurricanes and tornadoes. Hurricanes and tornadoes are both types Of severe weather, but they are very different In terms of their size, strength, And how they form. Hurricanes occur fairly often in late summer-- I never could bring myself to take them down. I guess it seems like having them up... Somehow makes me feel less far away. -Hmm. -It's silly, isn't it? No. No, not really. It's ironic. So many of us are willing to believe The most incredible fairy tales Just because somebody at some point Labeled them a "religion." Is it any crazier to think that... Having these pictures of my wife up, In some small way keeps her spirit alive? I take it you're not very religious. Hmm. I refuse to believe any benevolent god Would let her die the way she did. My mom used to call me a easter And christmas lutheran. Oh, in other words, you go to church 'cause you think you should. Not 'cause it's important to you? Something like that. Hmm. Seems like a waste of time. -Towers must be down. -Yeah. Last time a storm like this came through, Phones were out for a week. [newscaster] ...The tornado caused Extensive damage to homes... You know what? Maybe even if I leave now, I can get ahead of it. I'd feel responsible if anything happened to you. Oh. You know, my sister's probably worried sick. She doesn't know you're here? Uh, no. She knows I'm on the road. But not here. No, she does. When? -When? -Did you tell her? You haven't had your phone this whole time. I'd really like my keys now. I'm just curious. Keys? Of course. -Well, thank you again for-- -uh-hmm. For everything.

So if you are near or in roosevelt, Telegraph, or junction, Please stick to your basement or shelter and stay put. [suspenseful music] Jack! Jack! Jack! Inside! Hurry! Come on! It just came over the radio. An f4 not five miles from here. That gives us three, maybe five minutes max. You made the right decision. Oh, come on! What's wrong? Old hinges. [wind howling] I've never seen anything like it. Jack? [jack] come on, you son of a... -Jack! -Come on! Let's go! [emma] jack? [jack] behind the shelf! [grunts] Grab a lantern. Hold on!

[announcer] [on radio] ...Wind gusts up to 150 knots, Severe thunderstorm warnings continue into the evening hours With a strong chance of tornados in the edwards county area. The national weather-- Generator's motor probably just stalled. One of the many joys of living "off-the-grid adjacent". I have to give the real estate agent credit for that one. My wife and I used to joke that the only people who wanna Live out here... Are either misanthropes Or in hiding. Which one are you? Former city dwellers Looking for inexpensive real estate. Kylie, she hates it, of course. But...Thanks to zoom, Her social life doesn't seem to suffer much. Uh-hmm. Right. It's funny, The more connected we are... The less attached we are. It's gotten even lonelier since the workers quit. I thought you said you let them go. -Did I? -[emma] yeah. You said you let them go While you were figuring things out. Hmm. Well, it was mutual. That's all. You know what I used to do for kylie whenever she'd get scared? -[upbeat music playing on radio] -distraction. Come on. Dance with me, emma. -[chuckles] -[jack] come on. -Jack, I-- -[jack] come on, dance with me. -Come on. -I really should go. I-- Come on. It's perfectly natural to be scared. -Just come on, dance with me. -Jack. Emma, dance with me. [button clicks] No. I'll be honest, I really don't know how I feel about you Going out there right now, not with everything that's going on. Okay. Uh, look, I really appreciate everything You've done, I do, but I have to go. All right? My sister, she's gonna be worried sick. So I need to call her. It's just the storms aren't over. It's too dangerous. I'm gonna take my chances. Fine. You...Will you do me one favor before you go? I'm gonna go restart the generator. Can you just let me know if the power comes back on? It'll only be a moment. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. [sighs] Anything? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. [tense music] [jack] emma. [metal clangs] [gasps] [groans] You're awake. What happened? I... -[jack] shh. -I can't move. [jack] try not to exert yourself. Don't wanna overdo it. Why can't I move, jack? To keep you from trying to hurt yourself again. And the gun? Protection. Here. Let's get this cleaned up. -Something wrong? -It hurts. Of course it does, silly. You got yourself a nasty bruise. But I can't bandage it up until it's clean. Please, I really just wanna go. Yeah. Can you please untie me? I will, okay? Once I'm sure you're not gonna do anything rash. It's lucky I found you when I did. Another storm system came through When you were out. Wait. I have to call my sister. Uh, where is my phone? It's over there. I figured you won't be needing it. Don't worry. I told her where you were. -You did? -The funniest thing. I happened to be writing her a text When she called. Why do you keeping looking over there? I just... Is that really necessary? Like I said, "off-the-grid adjacent". No. I know that, but it just feels like-- A man has a right to protect his home, Doesn't he, his daughter? I thought you said it was just us. I'm talking figuratively. [sighs] Why are you looking at me like I'm crazy? -Hmm? -Uh, sorry, I wasn't-- You wanna know what I think is crazy, Really crazy? Taking a road trip during a tornado. Staying with someone who hurts you... And I'm not just talking about your heart. I saw them bruises on your arm. I'm guessing they're not from a loving embrace? Meanwhile, I haven't done anything But try to help you. I swear, I'll never understand you women. [sighs] you're right. I guess I would just feel better if you untied me. I will. Once I know you won't hurt yourself. Please. You know, my sister, she's gonna call the police. And then they're gonna track my phone. They're gonna know I'm here. And then they're gonna come here and... I think the police have more important things To worry about tonight, don't you? Hmm? Now, where were we? There we go. There we go. All better. So you'll untie me now? [sighs] How do I know you won't try and leave? I won't. I... 'cause you won't get very far, Not with the other storms coming through. No, you're... You're much better off Staying right where you are. -Okay? -Right. -[jack] yeah. -[emma chuckles] I know you just wanna protect me. -That's all. -Yeah. [sighs] Can I get you anything, water, root beer? [sighs] Actually, there is one thing. -[door opens] -[door creaking] Can I have some privacy? Oh, of course. Be right outside.

[suspense music] [siren wailing] [thunder rumbling] [emma panting] [thunder rumbling] [wind howling] [jack] emma! Come on. Come on. You're hurting me. You have to trust me when I tell you I'm doing this for your own safety, emma. Is that for my safety, too? [jack] you dropped it. Not me. You're welcome by the way. [emma] what the hell is your problem? Quiet. -I just don't understand-- -I said quiet. [announcer] [on radio] multiple funnel clouds Are reported 170 miles Due west of the metropolitan austin area And moving quickly in a southeasterly direction. Wind gusts reported up to 200-- Sounds like it's moving away. Hooray. [jack] if this is gonna work, You and I... We're gonna have to have A serious conversation about trust. Trust? [jack] yes, trust. Meaning? Trusting me when I tell you I have no desire to harm you. [chuckles] You have a funny way of showing that. Excuse me? [emma] I don't know. Tying me up, Chasing me around your farm with a gun? You're right. I should have just left you out there. See how long you'd last with a twister coming through. Two hundred and twenty miles an hour. Two hundred and twenty. Do you have any idea what kind of damage Wind like that can cause? Maybe next time you pull a little stunt like this, I'll let you find out. Why do you care what happens to me? Because, unlike bryan, I actually appreciate you. Appreciate me? You know what I think? I think that you've been treated like crap For so long, You've forgotten what it's like To be with someone who actually cares. Look...I don't know What kind of sick game you're playing, -But I just-- -is that what you think of me? Well, it just seems like there's still A whole lot of secrets around here. -Like what? -Like, what's in the attic? [chuckles] what are you talking about? I saw a light in the window. Is there someone up there? Look... It's been a long day. You're not being rational, okay? If I was sick, would I really go out Into the middle of a storm, risking my own life to save you? Yeah. Your daughter would be so proud. [suspenseful music] [thunder rumbles] I didn't mean to do that. Why would you make me do that? Why? Emma. -Emma-- -please don't touch me. Look, I know you might not appreciate me Very much right now, But you have to trust me when I tell you I know a few things that you don't. Like whenever you were about to leave. A storm system blew through And took out a neighborhood not five miles from here. Dozens of people lost their lives, Emma, including an entire family. Not to mention a hundred more that lost their homes. Now, I know you don't believe it, But you're lucky. I mean, you've got a place to go, A strong shelter, And someone to look after you. And I'm grateful. Radio says another storm system's coming through. I really don't think it's a good idea For you to be on the roads until morning. Jack. [jack] and who knows, by then, Maybe you... You decide to stay longer? Jack. Look, I-I know how it sounds, But I mean, think about it. You need someone. I need someone. And here we are. It's perfect. Okay, do you really think -That this is perfect? -I told you. -It's for your own protection. -[emma] for my protection. I know, but think about kylie. How are you gonna explain me to her When she gets home from her grandma's? Kylie's gonna love you. She will. And you're gonna like her, too. I promise. I can't just stay here And pretend to be part of your family. Pretend? We're not gonna pretend. Okay. Okay. I-I-I realize that you think that you want this, But you don't know me. -I do. -No. You think you do. This...This could work. Let me go. This is for your own protection. I will be fine. That's, uh... That's what my wife said. Uh, could you... You just give me a minute. Um, I just got to... I just--I just need a minute. Um, just don't go anywhere. Wait, what? [jack] uh, just a minute, that's all. Jack? Jack, where are you going? Jack, don't leave me down here. Ungrateful bitch. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [tense music] [police radio chatter] [knocking on door] Sheriff's department.

We were collecting for the sheriff's fund. Oh, right. The sheriff's fund. They wouldn't happen to be here now, Maybe I could talk to them? My wife, uh, she passed. Car accident. Nearby? -Uh, not too far, no. -Hmm. I don't recall there being any fatal wrecks In the area recently. And kylie, well, uh, she's staying With her grandmother over spring break. Uh-hmm.

[dramatic music] [reporter] ...Require multiple days to repair. If you're watching this now, this is dangerous, folks. You need to stay inside. You could risk your life. [dramatic music] [storm siren blares] [thunder rumbling] -[storm siren blares] -[dramatic music] Hello! I'm down here! Hello! -Hello! -Hello? Is someone down there? Hello? Is there someone down here?

So, I'm thinking... Once these storms pass and make it through the night, I'll make us a nice big breakfast. You're in luck because I just so happen To be a world-class omelet guru. And we'll just relax, Start thinking of our new life together. Obviously, we both need to be there When we tell kylie. Uh, she's... She's a great girl, really. She just... [sighs] she's-she's been through a lot this year. You know, we just gotta be careful. She's still fragile. You understand, right? Oh, and, uh, you're a teacher, right? I wasn't--I wasn't snooping. I just...I saw textbooks On the backseat of your car and so I assumed. Um, but that works out too Because I'm already homeschooling kylie, And so, you can help with that. You know, two birds, one stone. Hmm? I just have one request. Oh, yeah, of course. Anything. It's kind of a big one. But it's also kind of a dealbreaker. I'm all ears. Well... If we're gonna be a family... Uh-hmm. I can't be tied up anymore. I know. -It's awkward. -Yeah. However, In my defense... You have been sending me mixed signals tonight.
