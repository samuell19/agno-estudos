CONFESSION DIRECTED BY HELENE FILLIERES Thanks, Patricia. Did you talk to Michel? We spent last evening at his place. I know. Michel is with Brigadier Marquand. Marquand? I'm really sorry, Jean. The mayor has been asked to secure the cliff for years. It'd spoil the landscape. What exactly happened? The day had just begun. The wind was warm. Maud was walking in front of me. Then she was gone. Benjamin, your mother... What happened? I'm sorry. Not bad, huh? Mr. Flamand, answer my question. We had a party here, between friends. Jean and Maud were the last to leave. This morning, I saw them on the path up to the Botte. It was maybe... 6:30, 7 a.m. I thought they were brave to go for a walk so early. You can reach the Botte from here? There's a path up the hillside behind this wall. It's quite a walk. You have to climb a lot. You can reach the top in 20 minutes through a narrow passage in the rock. The view is amazing up there. Luckily, it's also accessible by car. Did you see them leave together? I did, as well as a wild goat and its ibex. I see lots of them. I watch them through binoculars. Anyway, I saw Maud and Jean walking behind her. I know Maud likes that hike. It's her thing. It was a good sign that Jean was going with her for once. Why? Hiking's not really Jean's thing. Or any sport. He's wrong. Exercising is important. Maud was very sporty. Tell me a bit about her. What kind of woman was she? Do you think it's funny? I can tell you that last night, Maud was in top form. I'd never seen her like that. I thought that was a good sign, too. Meaning? Love stories are private planets, Miss. They obey laws that are unknown to the rest of the universe. They vanish as soon as their inhabitants leave them. Is this the way to the Botte? It is. Greg, stop. You need to stop calling me. What can I tell you? We've lost our connection. Greg... Stop arguing. It's pointless. I don't want to anymore. You don't care what I'm going through. We haven't slept together for three months. You think that's normal? Are you serious? I don't know what to say. It's over, done, case closed. I don't want you anymore, Greg. Is that what you want to hear? Yeah, right. You too. Fuck you. I came out for a smoke. I actually quit, but I call it an "air cigarette". Like some play the "air guitar", you see? Yeah, I get it. It tricks the brain to remember the taste. It was Michel's idea. Dr. Flamand, my neighbor. Yes. Your attending physician, whom you were with last night. I'm sorry about your wife. Bye, Clarisse. Michel? Coming! -Want a drink? -I'm fine, thanks. How are you? Fine. Is Benjamin holding up? I hope so? Maybe it'll be a wake-up call for him. That kid needs to grow up, become a real man. His mustache needs to grow. We had a great time last night, didn't we? Yeah, we had fun. Maud was radiant. Yes. Absolutely ravishing. And very, very... Very sensual. What exactly happened? Did you tell the cops you were my attending physician? The cop already knew. -What about patient confidentiality? -Nonsense. That doesn't mean you can't reveal your doctor's identity. Not at all. Want a drink? I'm sure it'd do you a world of good. I'm OK, thanks. I gotta go. OK. Bye, Jean. Bye, Michel. On her last night, Maud became a woman again. Mine. -How are you, Maud? -Oh, you know... You look lovely. What about you, Christophe? Is that so? I couldn't sleep that night. -Thanks, Augustin. -You're welcome. -Will you be OK, Benjamin? -Yes. That priest is an odd fellow. I loved your mother deeply, Benjamin. You have to believe me on this. From there, you can criticize me all you want. Others divorce or separate. But not us. We're respectable people, we'll stay married, no matter how sad and pitiful our lives have become. We're masochistic idiots who ruin the only life they'll ever have in the name of a sacrosanct pseudo-morality. -Are you OK? -Yeah. I really like your mother. I know. Mom really liked you, too. What an awful accident. We're going to miss her. What idiot launched this model? Did you, Jean? No, the designer... Yes, but the designer does what he's told. Last time... Was a different time. But also... these colors... Are you serious? Benjamin, got nothing to say? We thought we'd keep the same typeface, but use a red mountain -on a white background. -Alright, I get it. Well, it failed. We'll send it back to the designer. Agathe, call him now. -Got it. -Can you make me some coffee? Yes, Mrs. Duberry. Are you taking over? Who else? What exactly happened up there? She... She just fell? She did, yes. Then you called 911? Yes. OK. I'm looking for the truth, Benjamin. A semblance of truth. The truth about Maud, the truth about myself, the truth about our marriage, the truth about everything. Nothing but the truth. No false pretenses, only facts. Where did we go wrong? Who fault was it? Of course, we argued. There's no such thing as a couple without arguments. We argue, say things we don't mean, then we kiss, make up. That's what married life is like. It's the very basis of a happy marriage. A marriage becomes unhappy when rage and pain dissipate only to be replaced by a certain emptiness concealed by a screen of good manners. A polite void. Excuse me? Yes? Hi. I was wondering if I could testify without signing anything? I don't want any trouble. It'd be easier if you told me what it's about. The estate manager. I was there. His name is Raymond Forestier. At the time, he didn't understand what he was seeing, but it was odd enough to keep him watching. Did he recognize Duberry? No, he didn't know him. He insisted on it. He realized it was him when he read the newspaper. So, he saw a guy he recognized as Jean Duberry push his wife from the cliff? Not exactly. He was out for a walk, too. Meaning? He heard a thud, which he interprets as the body falling. He approached, the saw a man whom he now recognizes as Jean Duberry, alone, standing over the cliff. This is where his testimony becomes interesting. He claims that Jean Duberry stayed for a long time, several minutes, three or four minutes, looking down, without reacting. Three or four minutes is a long time. It was only after when he saw Mr. Duberry make a call. That reassured the witness and he left the scene. It's strange. Jean Duberry observed his wife's body at the bottom of a cliff without intervening, as if to make sure she was dead before calling for help. I know Jean Duberry well. Frankly, he doesn't look like a murderer. What do you think, Greg? Greg? I think it's nonsense. A guy making a call with his back turned... Your witness saw nothing. He didn't see the victim. He didn't know the suspect. His testimony is bogus. He didn't even sign his statement. You know that makes his testimony inadmissible. He wakes up 15 days after the event. Your witness' no good. Let me investigate it. The case is closed. There's no reason to send it to the judge. Something's up, I can feel it. Case closed. You speak French, don't you? Did things work out with your boyfriend? Greg, right? I knew you heard me. Sorry, I didn't mean to snoop. Everything OK, Hervé? We're just having trouble with one of our machines. It's the transmission belt, I think. I don't know anything about it. -I'll take care of it. -Thank you. Herve Dallois, our crop manager. He's amazing. Without him, we'd have no wine. Maud really liked him. Do you know Benjamin, Maud's son? We went to college together. Ah yes, that's right. Why don't you come with me to my office? It's quieter. How are things going with Patricia Rougier? Not too bossy? So-so. You know her well, don't you? So-so. I'm listening. Is there something I should know? A witness saw you on the cliff. A "witness"? It took you several minutes to call for help. I thought the case was closed? After your wife's fall, what was your reaction? I called for help. Before you made the call, what were you thinking with your wife unconscious for several minutes? Do you really think I killed my wife, Clarisse? Do you think I pushed her over the edge to kill her? I can't prove it, but I'd like to understand. Me too. Did you love him? The boy on the phone. Greg. That's the only good question. Did you love him at the beginning at least? I don't know. What about him? Did he love you? I loved my wife. I'd like you to understand that. I won't keep you. Will you be OK? I have to go. If there was something against him, would you tell me? Would you? What were you doing at Jean Duberry's house? Visiting the property. What the hell were you doing there? I like to ride my bike after work and it was on my way. Don't pull my leg, Marquand. Something's not right. -What don't you understand? -This man was on the cliff. The witness is unreliable, move on. I know you know Jean Duberry. That's not the point. You know the father, I know the son, a childhood friend. It's only natural I look into it. What can a man say about his own marriage? As far as I know, other people's marriages are a lot like mine. Both sides carefully keep their quarrels, their hidden arguments, their hidden humiliations to themselves. On the surface, the others are happy. Maybe only moderately happy. At least, they don't openly display their unhappiness. I loved Maud. I loved her. She wasn't perfect, but who is? Since you're going on a trip Since we're parting tonight My heart is learning I want to smile with courage You've put your bags On the front steps And for the most important signals I have my big handkerchief ready My only luggage is my love I don't care about anything else Since you're going on a trip My darling, I'm going with you Your mother had forbidden me access to her room. She had so many Françoise Hardy records. It's her favorite singer. -This way. You know the way. -I do, but... Hold on to me. Oh, boy... My feet hurt. Come. Come, darling. Come in. Come. Do you have to be such a sweetheart to the girls who work here? What are you talking about? -What is it? -My cup is cracked. You think so? I'm telling you it is. That's not a big deal. Not a big deal? This cup is cracked. I'll get a new one right away, ma'am. Who gave me such an idiot? It's no longer a question of getting a new one! You gave me a cracked cup. Get Jean-Paul over here. Where is he? What are you doing? Ah, Jean-Paul. Mrs. Duberry. Yes. This cup is cracked. It is cracked, indeed. For a start, I don't want to see this girl here again. Maud, this is ridiculous. It's just a cup. -It could happen to anyone. -Not in our house. Do you hear? Not in my establishment. I take full responsibility, ma'am. Thanks, Jean-Paul. Jean, you have to support me. Our employees need to know that there are no cracked cups in our house. Jean-Paul, go to accounting and ask for your paycheck. And if anyone else wants to follow him, he's free to do so. Benjamin, want some coffee? Yeah, why not? Agathe, could you make coffee for Benjamin? Yes, of course, Mr. Duberry. Thank you. It took your mother's death to bring us closer. What a shame. Did you miss running the company all these years? Maud did it very well. She made your life hell sometimes, didn't she? Where did happiness go? It slowly drained away, as if we'd stored it in... It seems to have slowly drained away, as if we'd stored it... in a can with a hole in it. And none of us knew how to plug the leak. What a waste! What a waste of two lives! Don't come any closer. That's Jean's office. He's been spending most of his nights there for some time now. Or he's in a room under the roof. Did they sleep in separate rooms? That's my understanding. Did you know that the estate was originally intended for Jean? It belonged to Jean's father. When he retired, my mother was chosen as his successor. As a result, Jean became his wife's subordinate. And he put up with all that? I don't know. I imagine it hurt him. That, and the rest. It's been like this for two years. -Really? -Yes. That's odd. I don't think I've ever seen them swim. -Hello. -Hello. We have a caterpillar problem. Jean asked him to come. Benjamin? Will you help me in the kitchen? Happy birthday, Benjamin. I could've given you a speech like last year, but I wasn't inspired. Here it goes. I figured I'd have to answer to you sooner or later. I kept a sort of diary addressed to you. -To me? -That's right. Maybe you'll get answers to all those questions you ask yourself without ever expressing them. That's beautiful. It's admirable. In psychoanalysis, we say that the father doesn't answer the questions we don't ask him. Benjamin, that's your chance to avoid 15 years on the couch. Alright. Benjamin, I decided to write this diary for you to answer those questions you ask yourself without ever expressing them. Perhaps you'll find the answers you're looking for in this book. Your mother and I were never accomplices, when everything is harmonious and nothing stands in our way. I never experienced passion with her, that exceptional moment when both people merge to become one. I didn't know what it was until August 3rd. Like every year at the beginning of summer, your mother sent me to our suppliers and service providers. I liked it, and I'd gotten used to stopping by Nelly's on the way. One of those timeless places I was particularly fond of because we used to eat her husband Joël's crayfish. Nothing beats our Sainte-Victoire. How's your crayfish? Beautiful. Let me know what you think. Stop, you're making me hungry. Table 10 is ready for you, facing the bar just the way you like it. Thanks, Nelly. I look ridiculous, I know. You don't look ridiculous. You look like a little boy. It's for the crayfish. American sauce stains. Have you ever tried it? No. Marjane. Jean. Marjane is a pretty name. There, in this legendary establishment on a roadside in green Provence, my life turned upside down. -Marjane is a pretty name. -It's Iranian. My mother loved Iran. You could be Iranian. You are... I am? Very pretty. As for the rest, I'll spare you the details, Benjamin. That night in the arms of this woman will remain forever engraved in my memory. I didn't even think it was possible. I never saw her again, but I'll never forget Marjane. With her, I became someone else, as if I were getting to know myself. But what man can truly know himself? Hello. Hi. How was your trip? Green Provence has magnificent landscapes. But nothing beats our Sainte-Victoire. By the way, Dallois' wife is dead. An attack in the night. Poor Hervé was all shook up. I sent him home. Really? Yes. That's life. Was the crayfish any good? Delicious. You should come with me at least once to try them. You know I hate crayfish. You stained your shirt again. You could've changed your shirt. I almost forgot. I found this little gift. A trinket, it's nothing. To make amends? For what? Everything. You should see your face, my poor Jean... A scarf... I already have so many. From that day on, Maud's remarks stopped getting to me. They bounced off the memory of that one night with Marjane. But let me make one thing clear, Benjamin. It is your mother I came back to. I never considered spending my life with anyone other than her. Yes, OK. Let's do that. What time do you get off? I'll pick you up. Bye. I loved your mother, Benjamin. I've never loved anyone else. Trust me on this one. From there, you can criticize me all you want. Am I bothering you? No, not at all. Come in. I'm working on the labels. Red or white, I can't decide. I read your diary. And I... It touched me. There's no need to talk about it. Well, I'll leave you to your labels. Are we eating together tonight? Yes, if you like. Is this a good time? Did you read it? What did you think? I don't know. What do you think about the scarf? He cheats on her with Marjane and gives her the same scarf, as if to say: "I cheated on you. Wear it." ? It's twisted. I think he comes across as a guy who's always felt misunderstood. -Hello. -Hello. I have to go. Your witness and suspect. They know each other well. No way... THE WINE SHOW IS BACK You said you didn't know Jean Duberry. Did I? The man you saw at the edge of the cliff, that you'd supposedly never seen before. You lied to us. Well... You know what you're facing for perjury, Mr. Forestier? If I remember correctly, I didn't sign the statement. Were you at the cliff that day? Answer. Answer, Mr. Forestier. I knew it was bullshit. I should never have agreed to do him this favor. What favor? What favor, damn it? The Botte. What are you talking about? What do I mean? The Botte! He told me to say what I'd seen that day on the Botte. Well, more exactly what I was supposed to have seen. He asked me to tell you and no one else. Tell me what? Tell her what? That I had heard a thud, went to the scene, and saw him. He insisted that I tell you that he waited a long time, several minutes, at least three or four, staring idly down, without calling for help. He told you to tell me that? Yes. Word for word. We got him. He described you very precisely. I recognized you straight away. Are you sure you don't want a lawyer? If you can explain when I broke the law. You asked Mr. Forestier to lie. Explain yourself. Understand if you will. You're busting my balls with your cryptic answers. Was this false witness to get the case reopened? You couldn't stand that we dismissed the case and validated the accident hypothesis. So you sent Forestier? To her. Why? So I can prove you're guilty? Is that what you think, Clarisse? You think I killed my wife? Maybe that's what you want me to think. Enough riddles, Mr. Duberry. What are you playing at? I'm not playing, I'm looking. I'm looking, I'm looking... You think I'm playing a part? We all play a part. Everyone plays a part for people we know or don't know. And when you're on your own, you play for yourself. Are you looking for the truth? Men are all liars, actors. Nobody knows what the truth is. Truth is no more than an opinion. What did Forestier tell you? That I was at the top of the cliff after Maud's fall? You already knew that. That I was a little slow to react? I confirmed it myself. That I ended up calling 911? That's exactly what happened. Are we going before a judge for bringing this truth to light? You'll first spend 24 hours in police custody. Sorry. NELLY'S Was Jean Duberry here last August 3rd? Jean Duberry? Yes, of course. He ate his crayfish as he did every year, but he was alone. We was with another woman, wasn't he? A woman? It doesn't ring a bell. Jean Duberry ate alone. It was early, too. And on Mondays, we never have anyone, so... Are you sure? A beautiful brunette with an unusual first name. Marjane. "Marjane"? Marjane is new. Maybe she can help. -Are you Marjane? -Yes. Do you remember the customer at table 10? He was here on August 3rd. No. I don't recall. Forgive me for insisting. He claims he talked a lot with a certain Marjane that evening. Your name can't be a coincidence. I don't know. I have to work, if you'll excuse me. Yes, Greg? He's lying to us. I have proof. This confirms my hunch. Duberry is lying to us. I know. In my desk drawer, there's a notebook. It's a kind of diary. Can you dust it for prints? You'll find mine, Duberry's and his son's, we're interested in the others. It's more than a hunch. The cover, and all the pages inside. I have to go, I might have something. Are you the Marjane Jean Duberry met? Did he come here on August 3rd? And you spent the night together. You slept together. You wouldn't understand. No one can. I can't tell anyone. Except Michel, who refuses to understand. Who's Michel? Michel is... My neighbor, my doctor, my friend. He doesn't care about me, he despises me. He won't listen. I can listen to you. You can talk to me. Alright. I could never to it. It's my life's tragedy. With you, I forgot, and... I believed it for a moment, then... I'm impotent. Impotent. That's OK. There's medicine now. I know, but... Blue pills, red pills, injections, pumps, rings... Welcome to the modern world. It works on others, but not on me. Michel says it's all in my head, but no one can get inside my head. Your wife? My wife hates me. I hate her. I hate my wife. She hasn't expected anything from me for 25 years. She wants to humiliate me, crush me, put me down all the time. That's what turns her on. But for me, it's torture. It's torture. Are you going for a walk? Yes. I really drank too much last night. No doubt. Can I come with you? If you like, but I'm leaving now. Put on your shoes. Understood. He said no. You didn't tell him about the fingerprints, they're on every page. He didn't write that diary for his son, but to hurt his wife. He's a pervert. That doesn't prove he killed her. What the judge is interested in is what happened on the cliff. Jean Duberry is a free man. You knew she'd read it, didn't you? Every word was weighed to make her suffer. But you've outdone yourself in your lies. I met Marjane, the real Marjane. The Marjane who did so much for you doesn't exist. It's an invention. I know everything. You think you do, but you know nothing. You came to me, Mr. Duberry. I'm here, I'm listening. What happened up there on the Botte? Come with me. What happened up there, Jean? You wanted to break your wife's heart. You made her believe you could with another woman. Maud knew you were impotent and she put up with it. You were angry about it. You wanted her to hate you, so you made her believe you could with another woman. What do you know about love? You think a relationship is a long straight line? That we evolve with logic? I probably went a little too far with the Marjane story. Maud made a scene, that's true. We remained on bad terms. Long days of silence, but nothing to rebuild. Until that evening at Michel's and that... ...fateful morning. Maud was happy at Michel's. She laughed a lot, drank a lot, too. It's disinhibiting, you know? She was so different from usual. Come, darling. Come. Do you want to know what happened behind that door? It had been two years since I'd crossed that threshold. Come in. Why her and not me? Why? Come. Since you're going... Since you're going on a trip... Who's Marjane? Huh? -Who is she? -Maud... Maud... Michaël Francart Subtitling: TransPerfect Media
