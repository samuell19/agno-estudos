Check! Check! The pressures and demands players of your son's ability... place on themselves to win are incredible. I can't afford to keep him in here forever. I just want to keep him overnight and then start with a child psychologist. I knew this would happen. His mother's not strict enough with him. She lies in bed drunk all day and the boy does whatever he wants. After he's released, it's crucial that he's supervised. The most important thing is that during his treatment... he's not allowed anywhere near a chessboard. I've got a drunk for a wife and a lunatic for a son! I don't need this shit anymore! You're crazy! Both of you! Help me... Today concludes the second week of competition in this tournament. Each of the players will play the other a minimum of three times... and the winner will earn the right to play for the world title next year. But the big story is the amazing comeback of Peter Sanderson... who is currently leading the tournament. The European Grandmaster now residing in Westport, Connecticut... stunned the chess world three years ago... when he walked out in the middle of the last candidates tournament... while leading by three games... and he forfeited the match to Viktor Yurilivich... who is only two games behind Sanderson in this match. - Congratulations, Mr. Sanderson. - Thank you, Miss Rutledge. - Your schedule for tomorrow. - Daddy! - Congratulations, dad. - Thank you, darling. My cheering section. You're playing the English. Lutz won't do that. - He opened his first game with it. - He knows that you're aware of it. I'll transpose. On a variation, yes. But it must be a variation that is unique. - I'm sure you have something in mind. - Of course. Get rid of knight. Bishop takes bishop. Pawn takes pawn. Rook takes Queen. That's to your advantage. With the excellent range of your bishops, he's finished. - It's a good play, but risky. - You don't win by playing it safe. Daddy... - What are you doing up? - I can't sleep. My bed's lumpy. Forgot to bring your night-light, didn't you? That has nothing to do with that. You want to sleep in my bed tonight? Okay. I'll tuck you in. Jeremy, have someone pick up a night-light tomorrow. - Hello. - Debi? Yes. It's me. I forgot something. Sorry to ruin your trip, Frank, but we got a real nut on our hands. - Run it. - Debi Rutledge. Female. Caucasian. 24. Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel. A neighbor found her. - Local? - No. She moved here... four months ago from Portland. What the hell's going on here? Gentlemen, this is not a party. Anybody who doesn't have to be in here, get the hell out. Now! I came out here from the city to get away from this. What to you got, Nolan? There's no sign of a break in. I think she let him in. - How long has she been dead? - Six, eight hours tops. What's the cause of death? You think whoever did this wanted it to look like suicide? He would have taken more care not to leave the rope burns on her wrists. The way I got it figured is he tied her up, slit her wrists... and sat back and watched her bleed to death. But that's not the main thing. What's wrong with this picture? There's no blood. Where the hell's the blood? Bingo. - Did Ms. Rutledge have a boyfriend? - I guess so. What do you mean you guess so? I know she had company last night. A man. How do you know that? Her bedroom is on the other side of mine. The walls are very thin. I could hear them. What are you trying to tell us? They were... humping? They were having sex, yes. I wasn't intentionally listening, but with the walls so thin... Thank you very much. Well, first thing I'd like to say... is that some of us have not had the opportunity... to get to know each other since I took for Captain Waters last month. And a lot of you feel that I'm an outsider... who took over a job that should have gone to a local... but that's the way it worked out. You can bitch and complain all you want. But you will tow the line in my department which means... that the next time an officer responds to a homicide call... he seals off the crime scene and nobody gets in... but Detective Wagner and myself. Is that clear? Also... I don't wanna hear anybody talking about this message on the wall or the blood. Nothing. - Anything? - I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region. - What about sperms? - No trace. - Prints? - No prints. - No prints but hers? - No, Frank. No prints. - Yes? - Mr. Sanderson? Frank Sedman, Roxbridge P.D., Detective Wagner. - I don't know whether you've heard... - Miss Rutledge. Yes, I did. May we come in? - Sure. - Thank you very much. - I hope we're not interfering. - No. - Morning! - Good morning. - Can we talk in private? - I'll get out of your way, gentlemen. - Nice to have met you. - Nice to meet you too, sir. I'll get right to it. How well did you know Debi Rutledge? Only in passing. To say hello to. What does that mean? I don't understand that. I've talked to a few people who say you and her were friendly? Well, chess tournaments can be boring. People have a lot of free time. They like to gossip. What did you do last night? - I played Gregory Lutz. - Yes. You won two games. You left the auditorium at 8:45. What did you do after that? I came back to my room and... went for a walk. - By yourself? - Of course. Of course. I have here a printout with all the calls to your room... and I noticed one here at 9:04 from Debi, "please call me at home". She was calling to give me my schedule for tomorrow. I see. The funny thing here is that... you say you only know her in passing... but this message says "call me at home" and there's no number... which would indicate that you already know her number. I got it from the tournament directory. There's no Debi Rutledge in the directory. That's because you're looking in the general directory. In the players' one everyone connected to the tournament is listed. We seem to be having a little problem here. Really? What kind of problem? I think you're lying. That's what kind of problem. - What are you saying? - We're not saying anything. We're just trying to put a few pieces together. That's all. - Thank you. - Pleasure. What do you think? He's got an answer for everything, but no alibi. You think he's dirty? I don't know, but you're right about one thing... he's lying. I'd like a different chair. This one killed me yesterday. Also the pieces on the board move too slowly. It's distracting. Will be sped up. Grandmaster Sanderson, there are five other players. If we were to accede to every special request... I'm not asking anything special. I just wanna be able to concentrate. - David? - No problem. Just a matter of adjusting the response time. Can you make it so they don't slide across the board? The audience is gonna have a difficult time following the move. - Can you speed them up then? - Okay. That looks pretty good. You're acting like a superstitious schoolboy, Peter. What's next? Incense and rosary beads? Grandmaster Lutz, you'll be sitting here for your next match. I can't sit there. I must be facing north. My power come from the north. Please. - Hello, Peter. - Hi, Viktor. You played an interesting game last night. Even though sacrificing your rook at E4... was the game I played against Valsney in '82. - I'm glad it helped you. - You're two points behind. - Doesn't that make you nervous? - I never get nervous. Besides... you will falter. - Not this time. - Well, then, this time... you will have to stay until the end of the match, won't you? I'll be here. Ready? Are you sure? What do you do? - Who told you this? - Mrs. Lutz. She said only that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium... to try and contact great grandmasters in the spirit world. - Has he reached any? - No. But he did contact a dead parcheesi champion. Mr. Sanderson? The phone's for you. Thank you. Hello? Hello? - Hello, Peter. - Who's this? Someone who's gonna become an important part of your life. I wanna play a game with you. Listen. I don't have time for this. You had time for Debi. - What? - Don't worry. I wiped off all your prints. What is it, dad? Nothing. Let's go. Mr. Sanderson? There's a message for you. - See you later, dad. - Bye. Get me the police. Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier? I don't know. I was afraid of hours of questions. I can't afford to miss a game. We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games. What was your relationship with her? - Casual. - You were boning her, weren't you? It wasn't serious. What's your problem? You are. I don't like you. Fine. Don't ask me out on a date. Don't worry. I won't. I see how your dates end up. Knock it off. Both of you! Now this is just a little too convenient. What's that supposed to mean? If I were the killer and I thought the police were closing in on me... I might invent someone to try to throw them off the scent, too. That's crazy. Why would I do that? You like to play games, don't you? Listen. He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at 11. Why don't you come back and listen for yourself? Don't worry, we'll be back. You can bet on it, pal. You must understand. This is not my field. It's not mine neither, but I can tell you, this guy's crazy. That's your business, Doc. You deal with crazy people. I deal with people with problems. There are all different types of problems. We don't have the budget for outside psychological help. We'll take what we can get. He is acting out some kind of fantasy. We're talking about a deeply disturbed person. No shit. Can a person this disturbed give the appearance of being normal? Absolutely. Alright, we have a suspect, no hard evidence. If you met him, could you tell? - Tell what? - If he's crazy. If he's disturbed. Perhaps, but not necessarily. One opinion I can offer with any degree of certainty. He'll kill again. I'm sorry. I thought it was empty. It's okay. Are you with the tournament? - Are you one of the players? - Yes, I am. I've always wanted to learn who to play chess. It seems like such a complicated game. Not really. You see your goal and go after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed. - Sounds very violent. - Chess is a reflection of life. Life is violent. The strong win. The weak perish. You enjoy being the stronger one? If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion? - -That's a very personal question. - I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess. It is. Do you always open quickly? Are we talking about me or chess? You. It depends on the opponent. I hope you'll remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian. I think I've had enough. Getting too hot in here for you? Who are you? A reporter? - A cop? - I just came in for a steam. And how far exactly were you willing to go? - Well? - I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes. You didn't get any vibes from the guy? I'm a psychologist, not a psychic. - What's this all about anyway? - What did Dr. Fulton tell you? That you wanted someone from the institute... to talk to Sanderson about some case you're working on. - What did he do? - Not sure. - What do you think he did? - Could be a suspect of murder. The girl who was Killed last night? You sent me into a dangerous situation and didn't even warn me? They came to me and asked for help. - What am I supposed to do? - You could have been honest with me. We work together. I have to be able to trust you. Sanderson wasn't gonna talk to him. Besides, you're young, attractive. The guy could be a psychopath. It worked out alright, didn't it? Fuck you! - I won. - Congratulations. It's 11:06. Hello, Kathy. Thanks for coming. Mr. Sanderson, Dr. Sheppard, psychologist, helping us out. We've already met, haven't we, doctor? I see you're still having problems with your openings. Keep him on as long as you can. No confrontations. - Hello? - Hello, Peter. Just a second... Hello. Very amateurish. I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic. I am not an idiot. Don't treat me as one! I'll call you every day. You get one minute... whether you put me on hold or talk, is up to you. Are you ready to play? Why did you kill Debi Rutledge? To get your attention. What about the word "Remember" on the wall? That's something you will have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions. - Why not? - You don't wanna think. That's why I'll win. I'm already two points ahead. - What? - I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't wanna play. - Where is she? - You'll find her. If you wanna tell me something, just come out and say it! Where is she, you son of a bitch? Detective Wagner. I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to go back to your tracing equipment. If I wanted to play this game with a moron I would have called you. I suppose you wanna know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter. You're not gonna tell me that. Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town. Upstairs, downstairs in his nightgown. Crawling through the window. At the end of Miss Emma's street. Her god has gone and left his home. So her and I can meet. So what the hell you're doing grabbing that phone? - Sorry. - Anything? Nothing. We'd have a better chance if we tapped into the main junction box. Thanks, Mr. Sanderson. Kathy. Do you want me to come with you? Maybe I can help. No. We'll take it from here. You should have been an actor, Frank. You looked like you were really mad. The veins popping out of your neck, nice touch. You weren't mad at him picking up the phone? I wanted him to find out if there was someone down the other end. - But we heard him. - It could have been a tape. The FBI has nothing even remotely similar to this guy. - I think he's a first timer. - Call the state. If he hasn't killed outside of Washington, the FBI wouldn't have him. He tapes their mouths shut. We found traces of adhesive. We're doing a chemical analysis for components... but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store. We'll check it out. The lipstick he uses is interesting. Why is that? Because the company that made it went out of business 16 years ago. - What about the blood? - Not a drop. Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross. The fact that he's viewing this as a game, suggests to me... he's trying to prove some sense of superiority... and the way he's killing... shows a need to be in complete control of his victims. What about how he arranged the body? That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy. Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions. Once it becomes a reality, though... they reach a sense of euphoria and repeat the act to sustain that feeling. But in all the research I've ever read on Serial Killers... I've never heard of one moving this fast. It's as though the game is the catalyst for the murders and not the other way around. Anything else? Why disguise your voice if no one knows it? That's what I was thinking. I mean, he's gotta be local. Why would he call Sanderson? He's one of the best chess players in the world. Who better to play a game with? You're still having a problem with that? Yeah, I am. I got a feeling about this guy. It's like he's laughing at us. I'm telling you. He's playing us, Frank. We should bring Sanderson in on this. There's a reason why the killer's calling him. - No way. - Captain, we found her. They're trying to control my thoughts. Aluminum foil. It repels the thought rays. Very nice. - They couldn't break the riddle. - Did you think it was gonna be easy? You think he was gonna lay it at your feet? We need your help. I offered my help this morning, Sedman turned me down. You are the key. You're the one he wants to play the game with. I can't now. I've got a game. There's a young woman who could be dead by the end of this game. - She could be dead now. - What if she isn't? I don't believe this. Where are your priorities? You have to think between a chess game and someone's life? The girls who was killed last night was 21 years old. He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage. Gentlemen! Excuse me. Same as the others? Backspace. Boing. Here you go. Keep it going up. Right. There you go! Good! - Morning. - Good morning. - Daddy! - Got a problem? Our computer is bust again. - Is it bad? - No, it's all fixed. I also put a few games. I hope you don't mind. Of course not. I'm gonna play with them. Just kidding! I have to go over to Lutz's room now. He thinks someone tampered... with his computer and it's emitting gamma rays to control his thoughts. I'll see you guys later! Don't you wanna say something to David? - Thank you. - You're welcome. You ready? For what? You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today. I'm sorry, baby. I can't. Not today. But you promised. Baby, I'm sorry. ¿Peter? - Not now, please. - Yes. Now! Don't do to Erica what you did to your wife. - Don't bring her into this. - Why not? It's true, isn't it? I watched you push her away from you. I sat back, I said nothing. But not this time. This time, I'm going to say what I have to say. You're here to coach my chess game, not my life! You raise your voice to me? You? You think you can speak to me like this just because you won a few titles? No. I'm sorry. You're like a son to me. It hurts me to see you missing so much of your life. This is where he forced his way in. We found some fibers on the window sill... probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope... and if it likes me. It's a man's shoe. Pretty old by the individual characteristics. About a size 9, maybe 10. What's this? Don't know. Looks like a cut or a gash in the sole of the shoe. I think Fulton was right. This guy's not gonna stop. - He's got a taste for it now. - Make sure that Brooks... has everything set up for the next call. No excuses this time. Alright. Just do what I told you. I'll call you back later. - Frank, good morning. - Good morning, Mayor. I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by. How nice. I heard there was another one. - Any new developments? - No, nothing yet. People are scared, Frank. I know that. You know that 70% of the economy of this island... is generated through tourism. This weekend the ferry tolls were down by 30%. The hotel vacancy rates were 20% below normal. People aren't coming over here any more, Frank. We have got a major problem on our hands... one that could seriously jeopardize the financial stability of the community. I understand you have a prime suspect in Peter Sanderson. Who told you that? Let's just say that I have friends in this community... a lot of concerned friends who whisper a thing or two in my ear from time to time. - What about Sanderson? - He's a suspect, that's all. If he's involved he's not alone. I don't have enough evidence to do anything. Let me make myself clear. I am not interested in proof. I'm not even interested in evidence or a conviction. What I'm interested in is an arrest. An arrest that will get the press off my ass... and that the tourists with their wallets start coming back over here. You want me to arrest Sanderson without sufficient evidence? I'm the Mayor of this community because the people have confidence in me. If their confidence falls, I will not be re-elected... and I need hardly remind you that your job is an appointed position... by the holder of this office. I don't know. I've been... a cop over 20 years now and I have yet to figure out who's worse... the criminals who break the law or the assholes who make them. I am the Chief of Police here and as long as I am... I'll arrest people on the basis of evidence and not for political ramifications. I could have your badge for that, Sedman. And I could run over to the press and tell them how you're willing... to do away with due processing to sell a few more shrimp cocktails. Have a nice day. One more thing, Mayor. I don't like threats. I've dealt with politicians who are a damn sight tougher than you. When this thing is solved you can give your speeches and have your photo taken... but in the meantime, let me do my job. - Morning. - They found that third girl. Her name was Loraine Olson. I just came from there. God, it was horrible. How can anyone do something like this? - Do you have anything to drink? - Of course. Sit down. Thank you. Hey, relax. How the hell can I relax after what I've just seen? I know it was bad. How could you know, unless you were there? I'm sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I'm sure you didn't. You know Andy thinks you're doing this. - Doesn't that scare you? - No. - Why? - Because I think he's wrong. - Morning. - Morning. Ready to go? I should have brought my fucking fishing pole. It's from the rain. Foundation leaks. - How's it going here? - We're all set. All calls coming into Mr. Sanderson's room will be re-routed into 611. Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight. You know her? - Not really. - Why her? - Because she's the type. - You just said you didn't know her. I know what I said. She looks just like... Just like who? I really wish you would stop trying to maneuver me. I find it irritating, not to mention insulting. - What the hell's that? - It's the water pumps. - Just trying to play the game. - You're not playing very well. There are clues all around you and you keep missing them. Listen, if you're just calling up to gloat, I don't wanna hear it! People will be very interested in what I have to say. - Then call them. - Are you crazy? Let's see how much he wants to play. Just for that, no hint today. Why are you doing this? You must have an idea of the pain you're causing people. Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have. You want these girls to feel your pain? Please... I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game. How? I couldn't say it any better than Huxley. Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just". So is mine, within the framework of my rules. What the hell do you think you're doing slamming the phone down? You think you're gonna catch him on a trace? What he does is planned out well in advance. The only way you're gonna get him is to rattle him, make him slip up. You never know how you can catch a suspect. Excuse me, Captain, but I think Peter's right. This guy's gotta be forced into making a mistake. - We didn't ask for your opinion. - Maybe you should. You don't tell us how to run our investigation, pal. You got that? You don't have an investigation without me. You got that? You two through with this? What do you wanna say, Kathy? I think we ought to play up to his ego more. The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take. Okay. What about this Huxley? What is that? He was referring to a quote by Thomas Huxley. "The chess board is the world, the rules are what we call nature. The player on the other side is hidden from us... but we know that his play is always fair, just and patient. We also know that he never overlooks a mistake." You're not the easiest person in the world to get close to. Me? We always talk about me. What about you? What about me? I dunno. Where's Erica's mother? She died in a car accident. Oh, I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. It must've been very hard on Erica. It was. And you? Do you want me do lay down, doctor? Why don't you just ask me what you want to know? Was it serious between Debi and me? No. Have I known lots of girls like her? None of your business. Have you noticed that every time we start to talk... about something serious you begin playing games? - I'm not playing a game now. - Yes you are. You're playing word games. What is this? I'm just trying to get to know you better. - By attacking me? - Attack you? Who could attack you? You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impassable... you become trapped behind your own defenses. You cut off everyone around you. What are you talking about? You don't even know me. Does anyone? Are you forfeiting? No. I just don't wanna fight with you. Then show me who you are, Peter. I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time. You have to face the things you feel. What happened to facing the things we feel? You can turn everything around so easily. This isn't just another game, is it? No. - I'm hungry. - Call room service. I hate hotel food. - What about a pizza? - Good. Rondi's is right down the street. Okay. I'm gonna take a shower. - What do you want on it? - You! - Did you call? - No answer. I'm gonna try again. - Where are you going? - I'm going to pick up the pizza. They're not delivering. - Didn't you say the line was busy? - It was and then I got through. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Why are you backing up then? The phone book? I was looking for connections between names, addresses... anything that might be the same about them. You're as bad as Andy... maybe worse. - Peter, you have to admit... - Admit what? That I was right about you in the steam room? That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room? How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it? Ladies and gentlemen. Since Grandmaster Sanderson leads the tournament with nine wins... and Grandmaster Yurilivich is in second place with eight... we have decided that their remaining games between Grandmaster Sanderson and Yurilivich will be held separately. Thank you. Rook C2. Yes. - What is it? - Mate in five. Queen E3. He didn't see it. Check. Daddy! Here! - Hi, dad! - Hi, baby. He just got lucky tonight. You'll cream on next time. I sure will. You have something you wanna say? Just wanted to know whether you'd like to talk. - About what? - Whatever is on your mind. Who says something is on my mind? What do you see here? I know. Mate in five. - Why move E3? - Obviously because I didn't see it. Is it Kathy? No, it's not Kathy. - Who's Kathy? - When I told you to live your life... I didn't mean you to start in the middle of a match. I told you, it's not Kathy. Who's Kathy? I know you better than you think, Peter. Who's Kathy? Alan! God, you scared the hell out of me. She had just arrived from Seattle... and we decided to share an apartment. Did she have a boyfriend? No. Does the name Peter Sanderson mean anything to you? No. God, how can somebody do something like that? Captain, you gotta a call. - Who is it? - Dr. Sheppard. - Yeah, it's the same shoe, alright. - No doubt about it. Was there anyone else on the grounds? - A few people. - Did anyone stand out? What do you mean, stand out? Did anyone look suspicious? Think! There was someone there that was kind of suspicious. What was suspicious about him? He was holding a sign that said, "Serial Killer", alright? Miss! Excuse me. It's okay. You said Mary Albert moved out here from Seattle. How long ago was that? Just a few months ago. How did you find your apartment? Through a rental agency. I see. Thank you very much. What's up? You told me that Debi Rutledge found her place recently, right? Yeah, so? Come on. Now you've been very helpful. Thank you. All girls rented new homes in the last year and they rented them from... Roxbridge Rentals. Boy, you're just great for a headache. All our listing are in this computer. We don't keep any other files. Who else works here beside you? There's a girl, helps the counter part time, that's it. Anyone else has access to the files? No one. Okay. Thank you. - Dead end? - Detour. Hi. You must be Erica. - I'm Kathy. - Alright. - Is your dad home? - He should be right back. - Would you like to come in? - Yes, please. Thank you. So, are you enjoying yourself while you're on the island? Not really. It's pretty boring. Boring? That's just because you don't know where to go. Do you like... hiking? Sailing? - Fishing? - Yuck! No way! - What do you like? - Boys. - Do you like my dad? - Of course I like your dad. Oh... you mean, do I like... like him? - I know he really likes you. - Really? How do you know? Did he say something? Not, but I can tell. A woman knows these things. Why don't you go down and see Jeremy? - Nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you. - I like her. She's nice. - Yeah, yeah, now go, okay? Hello? Hello, Peter. Do you have any idea what the message is? Well, if it's important, why don't you tell me? I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. Not that you're playing very well. - You like to brag, don't you? - Credit should be given where it's due. I'm not worldly like you. I am not an internationally known figure. I'm just a poor guy who has never been anywhere, but I am beating you. Why were you looking for Doctor Sheppard today? - What? - You heard me. What were you doing at the Institute looking for her? What makes you think I was there? I couldn't tell you that. It would ruin the game. The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time. No, it's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're just wondering, how much do I really know... how close I'm getting. I'm getting pretty close, pal... and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall! Very nice speech, Peter. Did you rehearse that or was it impromptu? There's an old wooden bench in the garden. Next to it is a rock. You'll find a message for you under it. Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are. "Peter: In a fierce magazine you will find a hint of my action to come. As large as you may be in the world of pawns and castles... you are still light years from reaching me. Invisible as the air, one hundred men with their desperate pleas to stop... can't move me." - Why does he set this line apart? - For emphasis? Exactly. It's the key. What does he mean by fierce magazine? Violent? A fierce magazine... brutal... an angry magazine... a war magazine... - a scary... - Mad... Mad Magazine! - Do we have a note? - We just put it on the board. No, I need the original note. - Here. - Maybe. The kids at the clinic love to read Mad Magazine. If you fold the pages just right... the text reads differently. "Peter, in a fierce action to come. As large as castles, you are still light as the air... one hundred men can't move me." - That doesn't make any sense. - Because we don't understand it yet. - But a hundred men could move him. - He's not talking about himself. Then why don't he tell us what he's talking about then? If we'd knew that, we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He is telling us where he's gonna kill tonight, and we can't see it. Let's back up and look at what we do now. These girls are all the same type, they were all murdered at night... they moved in a new quarters in the last year... and they all rented from the same place: Roxbridge Rentals. I thought the rental place was a dead end. It's gotta be more than a coincidence. Someone is accessing the files. The woman who owns that place has a son. We're trying to locate him. We're also checking on the cleaning service. He moves around a lot. Why? He finds his victims through Roxbridge Rentals. He goes where they are. But they rent so many places. Why should he move all over the island? Jesus! It can't be that easy! What? You wanna tell us what the hell you're doing? He told us and we missed it. He said he's never been anywhere. Therefore, this island is the world to him. As far as he's concerned this is a map of the world. That's why he quoted Huxley. "The chessboard is the world". He is using the map as a chessboard! The son of a bitch is playing chess with me! Wait a minute. How can he be playing chess with you? You haven't made a move against him. Maybe I already have. E2, E4. D2, D4. It must be an opening. He starts the game, he's white. B1, C3. And C1, F4. It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening. David? Can you get into the Federation records? Sure. We got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York. Can you bring up the tournament records of the past ten years? Mr. Sanderson, there could be hundred of thousands of games. We're only interested in the names of people... that have played opposite to Mr. Sanderson. Search for anyone who used that opening against me. There should be less than a handful. The first is 1983. Lionel Baines. Boston. No, no, no. He died two years ago. 1985. Hans Korshaud. No, he's seventy years old and he lives in Holland. - What is it? - New York, 1986. Viktor Yurilivich. He's replaying the game I played against him... move by move, using the girls as the chess pieces. You found all the girls in their homes... except Christie Eastman, who was found in the back of a warehouse. He had to move to that grid in order to follow the game he played against you. Right. D4. It's a commercial area. No one lives there. That's where he had to place the body to make the move. Can you guess what his next move is going to be? His last move was C1, F4. My next move would be F8, G7. So his move should be F1, C4. Right here! You want me to what? I want you to take all these streets and feed them into your computer. As large as castles, still light as the air... but one hundred men can't move me. It's posed as a question: What am I? - A building. - It's not as light as the air. What's large, as light as the air and can't be moved? As large as castles. Why say castles if you mean a general type structure? He's not gonna give us direct hints, he's gonna squirt around it. He names castles, plural... then says, "can't move me", singular. Why not say "can't move us?" A shadow. What's as big as a castle? As light as the air... but one hundred men can't move it? The shadow of the castle. Are there any buildings with the name "castle" in it... that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another... There's an apartment in the area called "Castle Arms". - That's gotta be it. - Right. Okay. The Rental Agency gave us the name Laura Owens. She moved into an apartment across from the Castle Arms a week ago. We're sending her over to stay with her parents in Seattle... where the police over there are going to watch her tonight. Officer Gordon, I want you to spend the night in her apartment. Andy, I want you to go to the hotel... stick with Yurilivich through the tournament... and wherever he goes afterwards, alright? With any luck tonight, we're gonna wrap this up. You all set? You wanna tuck me in? Maybe later. - Okay, everybody in position? - All set. What happened? There seems to be a problem with the board. It's gone crazy. The computer is down. It'll take several hours. Adjourn to tomorrow? Our expert tells us that the computer will take several hours to repair. Forgive us, ladies and gentlemen... but until tomorrow then. Thank you. Getting a bad feeling about this. If Yurilivich were making a move Andy would have called by now. - You think we're in the wrong place? - No, this is gotta be it. It's the only building around here with the name "castle" in it. Around here. What does that mean, around here? There's the Castle Crown Apartments over on Pine Road across town. Why the hell wasn't I told that before? It's in another grid. - You said you only wanted to cover... - I said I wanted options, goddamit! This guy's a psychopath, for Christ's sake! How is she? - She's gonna make it. - You alright? I've seen a lot of things on this job, nothing like this. Yurilivich? I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel. Come on, move it. Get it up there. - What about Sanderson? - I spoke to Jeremy. Sanderson went out after the match, he hasn't come back since. Find him. I wanna talk to him. - Can I come in? - Sure. Thank you. The other night, I... said some things that maybe I shouldn't have. I mean... you haven't known me for very long and... I can see how you thought what you did. I'm not looking for an apology, Peter. When this is over, maybe we could... I want someone I can feel close with. I don't think that's possible with you. You really haven't seen my best side. Remember how you said I hide myself behind my chessboard? Well, ever since my wife died I... I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again. Afraid of losing them. Your wife died. You shouldn't feel responsible for that. It wasn't an accident. She... she drove her car over that cliff. The police said it was an accident, but I knew... I've always known. I closed myself off to her... and then... when I found the letter I closed myself off to everything else. Beating Yurilivich and playing for the title... was all I could think about. Then I had a breakdown in the middle of the match. I couldn't go on. I've never opened it. Why not? Because I know what it says. Maybe you're afraid of what it says. Can you stay with me, please? Peter. There are many pains we feel in this world... but loving someone who has shut you out of his life... has to be the most unbearable of them all. I don't know when things started to change... or how we ever drifted so far apart... but I can no longer stand the pain and the emptiness. So, I'm leaving... going some place where the pain will finally stop. This is my choice. My release. I only ask that you shield Erica from the truth... and forgive me for what I am about to do. I love you, Jennifer. Dr. Sheppard, what goes on in the mind of someone like this? That's a very general question to try to answer. Is there a usual scenario? Yes. We usually find that they've had a traumatic childhood... and he was probably abused by a dominant female figure. That, coupled with the fact that none of these girls were actually raped... leads us to believe that he may be impotent or latent homosexual. Regardless, he's acting out some kind of revenge fantasy... that probably fulfills some sick sexual needs. - Peter? - Hi, Jeremy. - Where's Erica? - She went to town with Mrs. Lutz. - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I did. - Feel like practicing? - I can't. I gotta meet my friends down in the dungeon. Jeremy, I know this is your dream as much as it is mine. I just want you to know I'm gonna do my best. I know you will. You'll win. - Where were you last night? - Ah, come on... We're not gonna go through this again. - Just answer the question. - I went out. Don't fuck with us! Where did you go? - He was in my place. - What time did he get there? - About a quarter to one. - We're interested where you were... from the time you left the auditorium till you got there. - I was at the beach. - You weren't over on Pine Road? - I'm positive. - You're lying. Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddamn accusations! You wanna arrest me, do it! Otherwise, back off! It's a big game to you, isn't it? A sick, fucking game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, but we're gonna find out. You gave us just enough information to send us to the wrong place. It must have shocked the hell out of you... when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish. I'm not gonna listen to this. - Yes, you are. - Get off me! Come on! You wanna shoot me? So, shoot me! You're gonna answer that? Peter. Please. Hello? Last night was very exciting, wasn't it? Have you figured out what I'm doing? You're playing the Tarakoss opening. Very good. Your next move should have been F1, C4. I used a variation. You should have anticipated that. Have you figured out the message? What word did you leave last night? The police haven't told you? The police. They think we're doing this together. Interesting concept. I hadn't thought of that. If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess... you might get it. I'm starting to think it doesn't mean anything. - Remember eventually revenge is... - You're hopeless. You can't even read a sentence. Didn't they teach you punctuation in school? The game end's tonight. Remember... eventually... revenge... is carefully... Carefully what? Have we tried switching the words around? We're not gonna spend any more time on this crap, are we? It doesn't mean anything. It's Sanderson. It isn't him. Frank, you brought me in on this because you wanted my opinion... as to whether or not he's even capable of doing something like this. Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective. You can't possibly be unbiased. He's right, Kathy. What are you accusing me of? Seeing what I wanna see? Protecting a murderer? What? We can't trust your judgment anymore. - What does that mean? - You're off the case, babe. I don't have a choice here. I can't run the risk of compromising what little information I have... and the future actions of the department by sharing information with someone... who's emotionally involved with the prime suspect. Sharing knowledge. And what if he's wrong? If you were so sure that it was Peter, you would have arrested him. And if it isn't, he's going to kill again tonight... and we're not doing anything with this message. We'll work on the message. Fine. This stinks. I think there've been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and Peter's the easiest choice. - He's a logical choice. - You don't have a shred of evidence! We'll find the evidence. You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm! Milk, two sugars while you're there. What a bitch, huh? Wagner. He said the game's gonna be over tonight. The next word is the last one. It could be anything. Remember eventually revenge is carefully... carefully what? How did you know it was "carefully"? Well, Frank told me. No, he didn't. Oh, no. The Killer did. - When? - When he said... "think about the way Anton Berger plays chess". Anton Berger wrote one of the most famous books on chess... called "Principles and Tactics". The first chapter is his three rules to good play: "Carefully, carefully, carefully". This is not gonna be like the phone book, is it? No. No. Of course not. - Are you gonna come tonight? - Yeah. I'll be there later. - Roxbridge Books. - Sarah, hi. It's Kathy Sheppard. Could you look for me and see if you got a book in on chess... called "Principles and Tactics" by Anton Berger? I'll check. Can you hold for a moment? Can you call me back instead? I'm at 471-3829. - Of course, Kathy. - Thanks. You shouldn't have said those things about me on TV. You have no idea what I am. - Peter... - Peter isn't here any more. Help! Help me! Help! - Did you see his face? - I couldn't, he was wearing a mask. I saw the cut on his wrist. It's Peter. I can't arrest someone for having a cut on the wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with? I have got a room at the Institute. I can stay there. Okay. Go on out there, we'll check back with you later. King base one. This Is King fifteen. Yeah, this is Wagner, go. I'm out at the old pier. I think you and the Captain should come down. - This better be important. - It is, sir. Over. Hello, Captain. Fisherman found this tacked... on the railing... together with his stick and glasses. "Peter, I'm sorry, but I just can't... do it any more." What is it? A voice modulator. He was never there when the calls came in. He's been covering for Sanderson the whole time. Call Judge Myers. I want a search warrant for Peter Sanderson. Kathy, what are you doing here? What is it? I've just been... such an idiot. What are you doing? You're crazy! Peter Sanderson, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court of law. You have the right to an attorney... - Are you feeling better? - I just can't believe it. You don't wanna believe it. It's a normal reaction. How come the police have no record of Peter from before? These things don't come out of nowhere. There has to be some kind of history, right? I found our Killer. Jeremy was my best friend. He would have never killed himself. I knew him like he was my father. Maybe he got tired of covering up for you. You might have gotten away with it, if you hadn't attacked Kathy. What? Sarah, hi, it's Kathy Sheppard. Remember I called you earlier about that chess book? Yes, Kathy. We called you back but you weren't home. We have the book. Listen, I need you to do me a really big favor, okay? Look in the first chapter. The author talks about... three rules to chess. Can you tell me what they are, please? Of course. Yes, here it is. They're all the same. Can you tell me what they are, please? "Carefully, carefully, carefully." Thank you. The Chess Federation got you a lawyer. You got three minutes. Looks like he's ready for round two to me. I got a feeling we go in the distance with this guy. Let him sweat. It's Peter Sanderson, calling for Richard Boyd, please. - Hello, Peter! - You son of a bitch! You're a sore looser, Peter. Cutting my hand like yours was a brilliant move, don't you think? If you kill tonight, I'm in jail. They're gonna know it's not me. By that time the game will be over. Anyway, I figured out the message. No, you haven't. Even if you had it doesn't matter. Who'd you tell? The police don't believe you, and you just used your only phone call. Come on, Peter, think. Think, think. Kathy, please! I'm getting dizzy watching you. I'm sorry. I'm just nervous. You're safe. He won't come here now. He already did once. - Why did he? - Why did he what? Why did he come here? - He was watching you. - That's what we think. What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here? You're losing me. What if he came here because he's a patient? An out-patient? Remember. Period. That's what he meant by punctuation. Remember what? Everything with him has been word games. Revenge, arranged, revenge, arranged... Holy shit! - I figured out the message! - Sit the fuck down, Sanderson. I figured out the message! - Hold it! - Wait, wait. He's gonna kill my daughter! Daddy? Daddy? Daddy! He wants me out of the way. I understand that this is just one of your games. You're so fucking stupid, you can't see what's in front of your eyes. Andy... I'll talk to him. Wagner! Listen. I'll do anything you want. I'll sign anything you want. Send a car to the hotel, please. Alright. I confess. I killed them. I killed them all. Oh, my God. Lock him up. Where is Detective Wagner? - He just left. - Where did he go? I don't know. - Send a car now! - No car. It's over, Sanderson. Don't move! Give me the gun. Come on! On the floor. Give it to me. Don't move. In the cell! Come on! Lock the door. Keys to the cuffs! Come on! Oh, great. This is just great. Oh, come on. - Boy, you scared me. - Who else is here with you? - No one. - Come with me. I can't. I have to wait for my dad. I don't have time to argue with you, Erica. Whoever's there, get us out of here! Frank? Kathy! - Is that you? - Get us the hell out of here. Erica! God! Oh, God. Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter. - Let me speak to my daughter! - No. I can't do that. I just wanted you to know that she wasn't dead yet. - Good bye, Peter. - Please, wait! The game's over. You lost. It's me you want. Let her go! As usual, you are wrong. Its her I want, Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat, That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? His play is always fair and just. You're groping. I've been fair. It's my move now. I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please! Don't beg, Peter. - I can't win unless she dies. - Listen! A few seconds. Where can you go in a few seconds? The noise. I know the noise. I know where you are, David. Very good. How did you know? The pump. Excellent. It doesn't matter, though. You still lose. She'll still be dead before you can get down here. Checkmate. Drop the razor! Put the phone down. Computers. That's the way you got into Roxbridge Rentals records. You can get into anything. Yes, I can. Including your mind. I'm in there right now, aren't I, Peter? I'll always be with you. No matter how this turns out. You think that I put you through some big ordeal. It is nothing compared to what you caused me. In your eyes, I was just another small town boy... to be crushed beneath the shoes of the great child genius. Nothing I could have done to you, nothing warrants what you did! Pain is relative, remember? You cannot judge mine. Stay where you are! You still haven't figured it out, have you? Tell me, Peter, do you have scars? Scars! From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen. We were only children. Oh, Jesus. Son of a bitch! The basement! Daddy! Don't do it, daddy! Don't! Daddy, don't! Kathy! Help! We're coming, baby! David! If you do this you are not going to win. You're going to lose. Again. You don't understand why I have to do it. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. I found your file, David. I understand... but this is not going to bring back your mother. My daddy left. Then my mummy. There was so much blood. It covered everything. You feel bad for not helping your mummy, right? I should have stayed with her. That's why I stayed with the others. I cleaned them, I washed them... so they look nice when they go see my mummy. I'm sure your mummy knows that. I'm sure she understands it. Children make mistakes, David. It's okay. David, put down the knife now, David. Please. Put down the knife. Put down the knife. Please, David. I can't. The game is over.
