I feel like me and Daisy are really, like, homegirls, like, I have my own distinct call in this house. [kissing sound] Anywhere she is, she hears it, she just looks at me. [Nia smooches] I love you! -[Johnny] Come on! -[Nia] She is so bougie. [rock music playing] [Dominic] You see that? -You see it? -Yeah. Look. That's 20 second. Right there. Showtime.

He is basically coming to kick me and Jess' asses. -Boom, and then right here. -[Jessica] Okay. Like you're throwing a baseball. Throw a baseball. And then, yes. [upbeat music playing] That's perfect. Tight stomach. When Tyler first broke up with me, I was just in pieces. And it wasn't necessary. I realized that a boy is not your be all, end all. And you can't let a small thing like a little heartbreak keep you from having fun or living your life. [Dominic] Good, straight ball. We got ten more. Daisy, come here. Aggressive intensity.

But, like… about taking, like, an oath of purity and not continue to live the way I've been living. I'm scared. I don't think it should be something to be scared of. It's definitely something that you could look at, like, you know what I'm saying, he's gonna work that much more -in your life. -Yeah. I think it's a good step, not only for Jessica's faith, but just for Jessica as a person. I think it's something that she really wants to work on. -Thank you. -[Marlon] No problem.

I don't think this way of thinking is healthy for you. I think that Jessica is frustrated that she got hurt by Tyler out here. And so now, she's, like, "Screw guys, I'm just going to be pure."

And so, instead of saying, like, somebody broke up with me, she's like blaming it on her, like, sexual desires. Instead of just being, like, "I got dumped." You know what I mean?

[rock music playing] [Johnny] So we're sitting here, cleaning Daisy's dog poop… [Averey laughs] …that Nia smushed into the carpet and dragged throughout the house. Nia claims to be, you know, wants to take the dog, wants responsibility for the dog all the time, but won't clean up the [bleep] that she smeared into the [bleep] carpet. But now… but think about it, though. Nia can't touch Daisy anymore. Nia's not touching Daisy. [Averey] She's not feeding her, she's not sleeping with her. Nothing. [pensive music playing] [Anastasia] I am absolutely aghast. Johnny belligerently shut me down. Johnny just wants to be selfish, and he doesn't want me to pipe in with reason. He shouldn't have yelled at me. [Averey] I don't even know why you got into it, though. [Anastasia] All I was gonna say was this is a stupid fight. It's over a piece of turd. It's over a turd. You guys are yelling at each other over a turd. It wouldn't have stopped. Well, I don't know why everyone [bleep] yells at me when I'm trying to make peace between everybody. Then don't make peace.

All I was saying was that you guys were arguing over a turd. [Averey] And now we're arguing over arguing. -It's stupid. -[Averey] So, that's stupid too, right?

She's, like, I thought she killed it, like. I thought she, like, chopped her arm off or something. The way she was screaming in the bathroom. -Tracked it all over the house. -[Jessica] Yeah, she did. [Johnny] Yeah, she's a piece of [bleep], disgusting waste of space human. So… That's what she is. Yeah, that's… doesn't really matter. It's over with. -I mean, but… -[Averey] That's how I feel.

Your child [bleep], you have to clean it up. I cleaned up the tracks through the house where I did that, but the initial poop, sorry. Nia's not touching that [bleep]. And then so, Anastasia's was trying to say something to him, and he blew up on her. -Anastasia was really mad or whatever. -Well, if I was her, I'd be mad too. She is crying. Really upset. You know, the whole thing. She's just, like, "I feel nobody lets me talk." [Jessica] Wait, wait. Ana? She was upset, because I mean, Johnny was like, going off on her. Oh, so it was more than just a snap, he… he legit yelled at her? -Yes. -That's bull-[bleep]. Yeah, I know. [Jessica] Even though Ana and I aren't talking, I still feel a little bit bad. She and I have a common ground on the fact that we both want to be liked. But I want to be a part of the group, whereas Anastasia's wants to be at the top of the group. [Nia] She wasn't even saying anything bad. She was just about to say, "Listen, you guys are arguing over a piece of [bleep]. I still bang with her, I know you don't. -I'm not about to not go-- -[Jessica] No, I'm not mean to anybody. You know, that's why I came over here to get this, and then I heard a little bit about what happened. I was just asking if you were okay. [Nia] I mean, nothing happened to me. Like, I feel bad for Anastasia. He's such a little, like, fool to me. And I mean, I keep it cool and, like, everything, and I am going to. Like, it is what is.

You're disgusting. -[Averey] I'm trying to get over there. -What does that entitle? -[Johnny] You're literally disgusting. -[Nia] It's your dog. Your dog [bleep], therefore, you have to pick it up. [Johnny] It's all our dog's. [Nia] It's not all of our dog… it's my dog? -Do I own the dog? -It's fine. Let's not argue. Nia's not gonna touch my dog anymore. -It's not an issue. -[bleep]-damn. -She's not gonna touch her. -[Nia] What are you talking about? [Marlon] Nobody's willing to be the bigger person. If one side would just admit that they were wrong, then that opens up the other side. Then you can legitimately squash these issues, and people won't fight over a turd. Low, low, lowlife human.

And I go… [smooches] …and then Daisy goes… and then Johnny turns around, he looks at me, he's like, rage in his face, all from me going like this. [smooches] The whole thing just really shows me that you guys, really deeply rooted, just really don't like each other. [Johnny] I tried to approach her civilly. I said, "Nia, you have to pick that up. you smeared it everywhere." "That is your issue. That's your issue." She immediately turned it around and started [bleep] with me. Do you think it's something more? Like, do you think it's, like, that she does that out of, like, insecurity or something-- [Averey] I think she might do that out of insecurity, 'cause it's like, "I'm gonna hurt you before you hurt me" type of thing. Yeah. She has to stay guarded. So, she has to keep the argument or the conflict alive. And I just feel like… Sometimes she just holds on to it. I thought Johnny and Averey and Nia had made up, I thought they were cool. But obviously it was just a quick fix. The real issues of what they were dealing with was never talked about. It was never squashed. They never came to an understanding, so it was just time before one little thing was gonna set either side off. She stepped in it, freaked out, and was like, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!" It just shows me the type of person she is. Like-- But, see, she's a good person though. I'm not gonna say that everything about her is good. [Jordan] I haven't seen it. But she's genuinely… like, she can be a good person. -Like, she can be-- -She can be, can be! -I know. But she can be understanding. -I don't see that. -There's good and bad in all of us. -Exactly. But I just want everybody to be able to see the good and appreciate that we may not be friends, but I know that you're not just a terrible person. Maybe it's wishful thinking, -but she can be a good person. -[Averey] Oh, my God.

It was so cute. [Nia] Sweetest little child in the world. My little baby. My little monkey baby. -[Averey] She's not your dog. -[Nia] She is. Yeah, you can't even pick up her [bleep], Nia. [Nia] She is. You're right. You're the owner, but she's my dog. [Averey] My little monkey. My little monkey!

No more Pokémon cards, no more getting upset over words, no more crying over the fact that somebody held your dog and didn't clean up the [bleep] that you were supposed to. -[Johnny] It's my boogers. -[Nia] Play with me if you want to. It can get real serious real mother-[bleep] fast. [Johnny] I will play with you, and you will lose. I [bleep] dare you, dude. [Jordan] Hey! Whoa! Whoa! -Whoa! -[Nia] Keep palming your hand over. Get the [bleep] off me. -[Nia] No. -Whoa! Hold up. -Nope. -No! -Uh-uh. -Uh-uh, it's not over. No, no, all day, every day, I'm bangin' it on you and your bitch. Stop. Don't do that, dude, don't. [Nia] Matter of fact, I really-- [rock music playing] This is already broken anyway. -[Marlon] You bigger than that, though. -I am, I am. [narrator] [tense music playing] [Nia] It could be a two-for-one combo if there needs to be. Where's he at? Hmm. Lessons learned. I think Nia's just so angry right now, she feels she has no other option. But grabbing a blow dryer is not… it's not a good look. It's not a good look at all. So, the boy is hiding from the girl. The little [bleep] is hiding from the girl. [Averey] I'm not gonna let some dumb bitch [bleep] up my boyfriend because he can't do anything to protect himself. I'm not going to do that. I care too much about Johnny. I'm not gonna let her hurt him. I've done a tremendous job on being the bigger person. But now, it's game over, and I'm [bleep] him up. I am the last person you ever want to [bleep] with, and he's gonna find out why. [door opens] [dramatic music playing] -[Jordan] Yo! -[Marlon] Yo! -[Jordan] Yo! -[Marlon] Yo! Yo! [Marlon] Yo! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Nia, let her hair go, yo. -Nia, stop, yo. -[Jordan] Let her go. [Marlon] Stop! Stop. Stop. Let her go. -[Jordan] Let her go! -[Marlon] Let her go, Nia, damn! [Averey] Let me go, Jordan! Get the [bleep] out! [Marlon] Dude, you have to let them fight, bro. [Jordan screams] -[Johnny] Averey! -[Averey] She has my hair, Johnny. -I can't let her go. -[Marlon] Let that [bleep] go. [Marlon] Oh, my God. [sighs] [Nia] Boop! What's the score? I can't stay here and try to talk Nia down. This is [bleep] ridiculous, bro. I can't get her to see reasoning right now. So, I just got to let her go. I gotta let her make that decision on her own. [intense music playing] -Let's go. Two on one. -No. I'm bigger than you are. Daisy. Round two? You're so scary. Like, what are you protecting her for? I'm not fighting. I'm not fighting. -Exactly. -[Johnny] Exactly. You're a [bleep] child, Nia! [all speaking indistinctly] -What do you got? -Please, Averey. -What the [bleep] do you got, Nia? -You're a [bleep] hoe. [indistinct shouting] [intense music playing] And you, swinging on me? Your life is over too. When did I swing on you? [bleep] Averey and not fighting your own battles. -Do you want to go? -[Nia] Yes, I do. -[Averey] That's it. -Let's go. Let's go. No. Take it, seriously. Please. Oh, Johnny, that's not even fair. Everybody in that room has, like, a serious issue. Nothing like something like this to show us that me and you aren't really that different. [scoffs] Like, our stuff was stupid. I'm still here for you, though. Like, I'm a [bleep]. [indistinct clamoring] I think it was just a buildup of annoyances for me. I've always said, like, I like you as a person. Witnessing what is going on outside of our bedroom right now, I'm just thinking, okay, forget the last harsh words that I said to you. This is bigger than that. And I'm gonna be here for you, Jessica. This just obviously shows, like, how stupid our stuff is! [tense music playing] [Jordan] What else? Wait, excuse me, I got to get closer. Excuse me. You're doing a fabulous job, by the way. Very good. [tense music playing] You're getting [bleep] up day in and day out. -[Jordan] Bye. -Bye! There's no rule in anybody's rulebook that says, "Hey, once a fight is over, there can't be any more." I don't have to stop. [Johnny] There's more of The Real World on the way, and it starts right now.
