ASTRONOMERS FROM MY NEIGHBOURHOOD The Telescoperos is a group that was formed five years ago to bring together those who make telescopes. We were already keen astronomers. We observed the sky with telescopes that we bought. But we wanted to bring together makers of telescopes. The main component of a telescope is the mirror that captures the light from the image and focuses it on a point which allows us to enlarge the image of the star. In the telescopes we make, such as this one, the mirror is placed at the back. Inside there. It is covered with a layer of aluminium. It captures the light from the stars and focuses it on the point where the eyepiece is fixed. It is actually a high-quality magnifying glass that allows us to observe the stars. How is the mirror made? First it is polished with emery. It used to be polished with sand. A lady in Valparaiso used sand. We put sand and water here and rub together the two pieces of glass. And the sand wears down the glass. This time we are going to use a machine to make the task easier and quicker. This is a Newton telescope. The mirror is 310mm in diameter. Here it is. I copied it from the telescopes in northern Chile. This machine has a mechanism used in clock making which enables it to compensate for the Earth's movement. The motor makes the telescope turn in the opposite direction, to maintain for as long as possible the image being observed. I'm going to open up the motor so you can see it. It's made from the motor of an old electrophone. A record player. If I want to slow down the telescope because it's going too quickly, this part still functions, but this one stops. Let's test it. Is the telescope turning now? It's turning but we can't see it. Usually a telescope does a full turn in almost 24 hours. It's barely noticeable. You don't notice it. What you can see is the declination movement. Can you see it moving? That's the fast speed. This is for focusing. I engage it and operate it with a remote control, that's what I'm doing now. Saturn, the rings of Saturn, are best observed with red light. It's easier to see the details. What about Jupiter? Jupiter, with a blue light. The light can be adjusted. What we are seeing next to it is Io emerging from behind Jupiter. And the rings? In the days of Pinochet... I liked to observe the sky when the electric pylons were blown up. It created total power cuts and the sky became black once more. This lunar map was created in order to locate the various lunar impact craters. This is the Sea of Nectar. Here are the craters: Archytas, Aristoteles, Heymans, Aliacensis, Arzachel, Alphonsus, Ptolemaeus. Here we have a complete planisphere of the South Pole and another of the North Pole. This hazy strip we see here is the Milky Way. So that I could observe comfortably, I had to invent a chair that raises me to the level of the eyepiece. You see? I used the mechanism from a car's water pump, and a sewing machine wheel. Right, we are ready. I often have to fix the telescope. It's hard for me to go down to the house when nature calls. It's necessary. So I decided to build the smallest possible toilet. Here it is. There is even running water. Is the problem fixed? Yes, the light is back on. - Good. - I don't know what happened. Something must have become unplugged. - Yes. - You must have pulled on a wire. How long did it take you to build the cupola, the telescope and the mirror? More or less seven years. Let's say seven years. Maybe a little more. It is never finished; there is always something that needs changing, repairing, improving. It is never-ending. What was the happiest moment of your life? The happiest moment of my life? There have been several. My wedding day, of course. And when I finished my first mirror and I was able to observe the universe for the first time. Often, what seems beyond reach gives man the determination to attain it. Subtitles: Katie Henfrey
