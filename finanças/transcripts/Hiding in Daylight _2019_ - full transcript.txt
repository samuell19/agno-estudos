(joyful violin music) (birds chirping) - Something smells really great babe. - Just finishing up dessert. Dinner will be ready in five so clean up. - You're the only dessert I need. - Maybe we should skip the meal. - Fine by me. 45P MURT request full shut down mode. (joyful music continues) - Adam Peterson identified. Audio shutdown, two hour limit. (machine shuts down) (joyful music) (door locks) - Chop, chop ladies! Hurry it up or we're gonna drink all the wine. - Oh, jeez, hang on a minute! - Girls take forever! - Seriously, every damn week! - Unlike you two? Wam, bam thank you ma'am? - Or man. (laughter) (wine pours) - Who wants to start? - (sighs) Took a long walk with Bella after school. - Aw. - She was the envy of every dog owner. - Aw, you really do have the cutest pooch on the Upper West Side. - My ninth grade history class was torture. Needed to decompress. How are the choir kids? - Challenging every word I say. Because evidently I'm not a young pop sensation and the music degree on my wall is junk. (laughter) - Everyone's a critic. You should see some of the stares I get at my gallery showing. (laughter) - Has anyone tried that new bistro on 78th and Broadway? - It didn't get the best write-up in the Times. - So we're letting the Times make all our decisions for us? - Depends on who you ask. Some believe it's full of fraud and lies. Damn. Sorry. I couldn't help myself. You left me wide open with that Times reference. - I got our season tickets to the Met today. La boh√®me is on the schedule. - I love the opera. It's such a top shelf art-form - Ah. Nice alcohol reference. - Cheers, from the Great Balcony. (glass clanging) - I've narrowed down our summer home in P-Town to three places. Should we book East End or West End? - Stop with this shit. P-Town is a ghost town and we're not going to the opera. - We know. We only get to do this once a week. Let us play our game. Coffee anyone? - Seriously? It's a friggen over in here. Get your air fixed Scott. - Or crack a window. - You know we can't crack a window. (eerie music) - I think I need something stronger. - Well this is fun. Next subject? - Okay, social media. Created as an addiction so people will freely give away information. - I have to report all the prescriptions I fill at work. - Another executive order signed today. - Ugh, he's the reason we're stuck in this hetero-shitstorm - Don't blame them. - I'm not blaming, I'm stating a fact, Val. I'm stuck here pretending to be just like them because of that asshole. - We have allies putting themselves on the line for us. - I'm sorry? I must have missed this on state-run media. Did some straight person punch the sovereign? - You can always count on Paul for a witty response. (laughter) - Just trying to hold on to some part of the old me. - At least your fake name doesn't sound like a Southern debutante. - Oh, Cecille, you poor sweet Southern thing, I'll pray for you on Sunday. (laughter) - Guys. It's one night a week we get to forget about all this shit. (eerie music) Can we please return to the game? - Fucking game. Our world is dead. - That makes this all bearable. (somber music) (piano plays) - What's going on? - It's getting too risky. These weekly meetings, playing the game. We need to stop. - Are you serious? Twenty-two years together, Scott. It's worth one night a week. - I'm with Paul on this. - Mm-mm, Scott says "Stop. Game over," We don't play. So, anyone watch the Cowboys last Sunday? Oh wait I can't talk football, that's too butch of me. - Seriously? Everything going on and you're worried about water rings. - Whatever. - Just remember this is our house. - You're an ass. - What's gotten into you Scott? - Can you stop using our old names? We paid good money for the new ones. - Sorry, Adam. (alarm sounds) (helicopter circling) (dogs barking) (alarm continues) - I hate this sound. - It's two doors down. Man and a woman I never would have pegged those two at all. (distant shouting) - Everything just changed in an instant. I feel guilty we never befriended them. - How could we have known Cecille? - Are we supposed to be happy it wasn't us? - Might be, next time. - How were we so blind when this started? - We weren't blind, we were complacent. - The Chechnya gay purge, That wedding cake debacle. - Or that elderly lesbian couple. They weren't even allowed to move in to the same old folks home together. - God bless. - There were people resisting all of that. - Well not enough. And now we're stuck in these fake marriages and it is getting too dangerous. We have got to stop. - Who died and made you boss? - They just carted our neighbors off. You have a better plan? - I have a better plan. Do you have any champagne? - What the hell are you celebrating? - The two of you, it's your anniversary. - Oh honey, I'm so sorry. How could I forget? - I did too. These fake lives. I can't remember what I had for breakfast. - Raise whatever's in your glass. A toast. - No, let me do it. I'm the one that put a damper on this evening. To the best friends a man could ever have. Wishing you love, light, and many happy years to come. I'm sorry. - Aw, Scott, now I can't come back with a smart ass response. (laughter) - Cheers. - Cheers. (glass clanking) - Come here. - Happy Anniversary. - Thank you. - I love you. - Love you too. - This scares the shit out of me, sorry. - Come on. Let's dance. - Okay. - Listen babe. I think Scott might actually be right about this. - You're not serious are you? - I don't think I can make it if I didn't get to see you each week. - It's just a little step back in the closet. It's fucking genocide out there. They are wiping us out. - We know that. - Then let it go just for a little while. - If I were picked up and put in a camp at least I could be with you. - As you line up to die? You want that? - Look, we've been hiding for over three years now, we're We're good. - Til a neighbor turns us in and carries us off! - Stop it! Stop fighting! I can't breathe, you're sucking the air out of the room. (door opens) (heavy breathing) (eerie music) (indistinct radio chatter) - Monitoring complete. Location confirmed. Suspects on site. - Copy that. (indistinct radio chatter) (door locks) - New game. (eerie music) What would you do if this were your last day? - I'd, um, I'd hold you. And kiss you. Make you realize how much I loved you and that you mattered. - I'd try not to be so goddamn petrified. - You guys really don't get it? The whole point is to not have a last day. We have to... we have to... We have to stop meeting. Just for a while. - No, Scott. You don't get it. It's not our decision. (loud thud) (alarm sounding) (women crying) - I love you. (door banging) Let's go. - Open up! (banging continues) (alarm continues) - Don't move! Stay right there! Put your hands up! Get on the ground now! Get on the ground! (alarm continues) (women screaming) (somber opera music) (opera music continues)
