Han Tae-ju, you asshole! Stop, you prick! Stop following me! Hey, go that way. You're freaking fast. You know what? With Min-gyeong, I thought I could understand. But three girls? Don't you think that's too much? Move! Why are you guys so tall? Who? Min-gyeong? Right, she's pretty. Although she's a little short. Got a death wish, you prick? What about Hyeon-jeong? I freaking loved that girl. She hit on me first... I'm traumatized because of you. I really hate Christians, but Gi-ppeum was an exception. I really didn't think she'd do that to me. She was the most charming one. Hey! Why do girls like this prick so much? I mean, I'm better-looking... Am I wrong? You piece of... If you punch me, you won't be able to handle the consequences. Jeez! My dad is a director at TB Group, you asshole. You're laughing? You keep laughing. How dare you laugh? Did you hit him? - Go easy on him. - Jeez. I was wondering where you were. You're this prick's minion. Yes, I am his minion. You minion jerk. Hey. - You okay? - Are you all right? Sorry to let you down. My dad is the chairman of TB Group. I'm not paying you to follow Tae-ju around just so you two can goof around like kids. I'm sorry, sir. We weren't goofing around. It really hurt. I guess you still haven't quit that habit yet. I didn't want to cause trouble, so I just let him punch me. Han Tae-ju. When you do anything wrong, I beat up Guk. You know that. If something like this happens again, I'll send you to the U.K. End of discussion. I let you move out so that you'd stay out of trouble. Behave yourselves. - Yes, sir. - Okay. I'm sorry. For what? Who knew I wasn't even allowed to get punched? From now on, just punch them first. That'd be better, right? Hey, I can't believe you told them that your dad is the chairman. Come on. That cocky douchebag kept provoking me. He said his dad is a director. Think about how baffled I must've been when I heard that. We're putting up with all this so that no one knows. Let's be careful. What? "Putting up" with this? Did you just say that? I have fun with you. I'm happy here. You're not happy? We can order fried chicken whenever we want and play video games together all night. We can also eat instant noodles. Right, I'm happy too. Babe, I don't want to go to the U.K. Don't do that. Come on. Why not? Seriously, I'll beat you up! Jeez, look at you. Dude, get off me. Hey. Are you okay? I told you not to do things like that. Damn you... Hey. Was that a fake? - Why? Were you worried? - Yes. Here comes the technique. I was all worried. Hey, let go. You're no match for me! Don't mess with me. I can provoke you even more. I'll attack your weak spot. This is the place. It's cute. The food is good too. And you rarely see people from school. We opened very recently. By the way, it looks like... I guess you're the top? And you, the bottom? - Pardon? - Pardon? Oh, never mind. What did she say? My goodness! We have customers. Oh, sorry. The fine dust is making me sneeze. Oh, right. This is the guy I told you about. Our first customer. He totally brightened my day because he's so handsome. Oh, no. You're that guy? So? Do you approve? - Yes, the food wasn't bad. - Good. What's up? Why follow us? My mom's been talking about you every day. You're more handsome than I expected. Hey. Girls usually stare at me, not him. Sure. Can I get your number? What the... Not my number? You want Guk's number? Here you go. I'll see you around. Hey. What's going on? What? You were obviously busy flirting with girls while I was in Japan. No, I've never seen her before. You were acting all serious and cool in front of her. What are you talking about? She now has your number. Happy? I didn't give her my number. Then what was that? A fake number. Really? Okay. I'm thirsty. So? Buy me chocolate milk, please. Buy it yourself. You're rich. Come on. Just buy me one! - Buy me... - Jeez. - You're so dead. - Hey! What's up? I thought we were done. I'm sorry. I don't know why, but my dad told me to go apologize. This is freaking embarrassing. Apology accepted. We live in a messed up world, you know. Is your dad really the chairman of TB Group? No. Not that it's any of your business. Right. I apologized, so that's that. Do not steal my fourth girlfriend. - Hey. - What the... - What are you doing? - I'm sorry too. Let's be friends. Are you nuts? Hey. Be my buddy, or I'll steal your fourth girlfriend too. Hey! Is something bothering you? Nope. Then what's the matter? I don't like that douchebag. Pil-hyeon seems like a nice guy. And he's cute. You're calling him cute, kiddo? Hey, I took you down with an arm bar the other day, remember? I may be a better fighter than you now. You think so? Then you wouldn't need me anymore as your bodyguard. I told you not to say shit like that even as a joke. Right, sorry. How about a showdown later? Sure. Aren't you coming? Stop it. Don't get into trouble. What's with you? I was just goofing around. Sorry. Dude. You're so ripped. We eat and do the exact same things every day. How come you're so ripped? You've seen it many times. What's with you today? Hey, who's buzzing you? No idea. Check your phone, dude. Just leave it. Kang Guk? Why did you give me a fake number? Who is it? Hey, did you give her my number? Come on. It's fun. No, this isn't fun for me. It's my gift to you. I don't want you to blame me later. Just do everything you want. Everything. I mean it. Jeez. This is Kang Guk's number. He said he gave you the wrong one. - You can thank me another time. - Who is it? Your Prince Charming? No, this one is a weirdo. So that guy's name is Kang Guk. - What? - He even has a cool name. I suggest you give up. Why? I just think you should leave those two alone. What do you mean? I've lived long enough to just know what's going on when I see something. They have such good chemistry. I don't think so. Don't go easy on me. I sure won't. Did you text her back? No, I don't plan to. Text her back. This is an order. You can't order me around here. This is the only place where I can mess with you. What? You're talking as though you never mess with me. Of course, we obviously... Do I have to teach you a lesson? Accept it and it'll be easier. Things will always be this way. I'm going to touch your ear. What's with you? I have to touch your ear to calm down. You know that. Right, but you can't. By the way, you should stop bulking up your chest. Look at this. This is almost like... Oh, man. Hey. Are you okay? I'm sorry. - I knew it. - It wasn't intentional. I knew it wasn't intentional. Did he text you back? - I totally knew it. - You see, I'd love a handsome son-in-law. Either of them would do, so charm them. Oh, dear. But I'm hoping... things will work out for those two. Mom. Stop it, seriously. I've got the warm fuzzies for a change. They're best friends, you know. Being a third wheel is always uncomfortable and emotionally exhausting. Damn it. This is so uncomfortable. Hey, I apologized. Okay, fine. You won this time. I can't study or eat with this arm. Cook me something nice tomorrow. Okay. Wait. How am I going to wash up? What do you mean? Just be careful not to get water on it. How can I wash my hair with one hand? I'm not even a lefty. You can do it. Can't you just help me out? No way. Hell no. Gosh, why not? I want to wash up. You know that I hate feeling icky. I'm your bodyguard, not your butler. Unbelievable. My "bodyguard" broke my arm. Damn it! This is so uncomfortable. I can't even take my clothes off by myself. What the heck am I going to do? I hate you, Guk. I really hate you. I know it's a little too soon, but what are you doing this Saturday? I have no plans. Let's hang out. I HAVE NO PLANS, LET'S HANG OUT Crap! Can't you just help me? I'm cold. Hey, that tickles. Just hang on. This is making me think of my mom. She did this for me from time to time. Don't you need a shower too? You should wash up too. I'll do it later. Jeez. Hey, I said that tickles. Wash up with me. I said I'll do it later. Hey! You got cold water on me. - So just wash up now. - I'll take a shower later. Hey, did you text her back? I'm going to see her this Saturday. I'll go during your tutoring session. Wow. So it's all planned, and you're just notifying me now? This is so unlike you. You said I should date. Jeez. Ouch! Hey, be gentle. My lustrous hair is so precious. Handle it with care. Yes, that's better. I have to say, you did such a good job with this. Anyway, you'd better not neglect me, even if you start dating. Well, that'd be nice. What? What did you just say? I said, it'd be nice. By the way, have you ever been on a date? Never, right? Gosh, you... You're usually quiet, so you'll probably be no fun. I'll kindly give you some tips tomorrow. What? You probably want to thank me. No, not really. Come on. I know you do. Hey, be careful with your arm. Right. You two-timed me with my friend. You even gave us the exact same gift. You jerk! Let's eat. Guk. What was that? You have good manners. And on top of that, you're handsome. I want that. And you can cook? You're totally my type. Guk, you're my type! What? What's with that intense gaze? There's something on my face? Come on. Let's eat. Look at this. Hey, listen. You're great, but you're not good with words. You can't just stare at the girl. Ask questions and keep the conversation going. I'll figure out what to do. You don't have time for this. You need special training. My gosh, what is this place? You like making things, so talk about art. It'll make you look cultured and intelligent. No, I'm not doing that. Come on. Why not? She seemed nice. I can't believe that snooty girl Min-gyeong came to see you. Hey, can we please drop that? I told you. I have to coach Guk on dating now. I had no idea Hyeon-jeong and Min-gyeong were friends. Can you just leave? Why? Just leave if you don't want to be helpful. Okay, fine. Hey, who's this girl? Tell me so that I can help you. Don't tell me... No, she's not your fourth girlfriend. She's a newbie. Jeez, you almost gave me a heart attack. - Hey, stop it. - Stop what? Dude, I bet you've never even kissed a girl. Did you see me kiss Min-gyeong last night? Hey, what the hell? You said she came by to fight. Why did you kiss her? It makes no sense! Never heard of an angry kiss? What? "Angry kiss"? What is that? I mean, I know Angry Birds... Are you a bird? Gosh, you also have a lot to learn. Am I the only one who doesn't know? What the heck does it mean? Kim Pil-hyeon! Hey, guys. Hey. You told them you were here? Don't worry. They're fine. Anyway, we'll talk about that later. Let's go. Why do you keep him close? It's boring if it's always just us two. How did that feel? Did your heart skip a beat? That's what dating is like. Surprise her when she's least expecting it. The same goes for getting physical. Although I'm not sure if you'll do a good job. Like this? Oh, look at you. Did your heart skip a beat? You're mad at me. Will you stop doing shit like this? Stop provoking me, okay? Seriously, please. I know it bothers you too. Get going. Will you be all right? Don't be so overprotective. No one's going to stab me. Call me if you need me. Sure, whatever. Jeez, this is such a pain in the neck. Is it okay to take it off like that? Yes, it's fake anyway. Let's move on to the next one. For this, you have to carefully read the question first so that you can identify the keywords prior to reading the passage. Here, you see A, B, C, and D. We actually went over this together last time. - If you look at this... - He's actually going. Tae-ju. Tae-ju? Teacher. I'm hungry. People say I should upload mukbang videos. Yes, you should. You're a big eater. Would you watch my channel? Yes. I like seeing others enjoy food. Here, have more. I'm not too sure about how I feel yet, but I want to get to know you better. I even had a dream last night. In my dream, we had lunch together and went to the movies. We were married. We already had two kids. What? Just kidding, okay? Gosh. Hello. What? Hey. Tae-ju. Did you tell him to come? No. Do you have feelings for him? What? What did you say? Or does Tae-ju have feelings for you? No, it's not like that. I'm like his bodyguard. What? Like a live-in bodyguard. His dad takes care of my living expenses and so on. So to be exact, I'm like his employee. I see. Is that a good thing? Well, I don't mind it. Hey, what are you up to? What's up? Want some pasta? Just so you know, I'm not Guk. I know. You're Kim Pil-hyeon. Hey, what the hell? Must I obey you like Guk does if you call me up and summon me? Hey, you're hurting my feelings here. I'm busy! Ta-da. Look, the shrimp has vanished. Yes, it's gone. This prick hung up. Han Tae-ju, this prick, thinks he's above me because I've been too nice to him. Hey, why do you even hang out with him? Are you going to ditch us or what? I have my reasons, okay? What is it? What's going on? Just tell us. Even this place. Didn't they bring you here? Jeez, seriously. Just tell us. What's the reason? He's handsome. What about us? We're freaking handsome too, you know. You guys are tall, but that's about it. Here's your pasta. Enjoy. My heart hurts. What? All of a sudden? Are you okay? You have quite a story. I usually fall for guys like that. I'm overwhelmed with emotion right now. Oh, I see. I want to get close to you. Thanks for asking for my number first. Hey, what's with that cheesy pickup line? And I really don't see you two together. You're both so weird. Tae-ju, the thing is... Guk and I aren't done yet. Can he talk to you when we're done? I'll walk her home and come back. If you're okay with awkward situations like this... It's fine. It's actually quite entertaining, so it's a plus. I'm relieved to hear that. What happened to your cast? It was a fake. I tricked you. Hey! Gosh, what's taking him so long? You should walk home. I'm feeling under the weather. I don't want you to catch a cold because you're my bodyguard. Well, my employee, to be exact. Mr. Yang. Turn the car around. Hey. You're actually going to walk home? Take the bus or just a cab home. Everything has to be on your terms? Get in. Why did I do that to you? Because you're mean. No, it was different. It was a different type of anger. Have I ever made you feel that way? What are you talking about? I want a hug. Like my mom would. Tae-ju. I asked you not to do this. I'm sad. PE classes are so useless. Isn't it better than studying? No, I'd rather study. Whatever. What's up? There's a dodgeball match. My class versus yours. So? Do you have no friends? Why bother us? I actually have no friends. I haven't made any friends yet. Hey. You're really mean. What? One, two, three, four. Five, six, seven... There are two extras. - Let's go! - Go, team! - What are you doing here? - Let's go! - No! - Gosh! Hey, you aren't in our class. Sorry, I have no friends. Jeez, she's annoying. Hey, enough. I'm very competitive. - Let's win, okay? - Yes, of course. Relax. This is just a dodgeball game. Then don't play. Guk, protect me so that I won't get hit. Sure, that's my specialty. I'm a real bodyguard, you know. "A real bodyguard"? Hey, you make me laugh. Don't let this jerk influence you, okay? All right. What? You don't find it funny? That was freaking hilarious. Did it hurt? Like you said, you're my bodyguard. You lied to me about hurting your wrist, so karma bit you in the butt. You ran to her without hesitation. I thought he was targeting Hye-mi. I'm sorry. Let's hurry back in. The class will start. Why are you sorry? It was just a dodgeball game. Right, exactly. Right? It was just a dodgeball game. I don't understand why I'm so upset. - What? You want to do it here? - "Do it"? Do what? Say it. Do what? You want to fight, don't you? Not here. Let's do it later at the dojo. Don't play dumb. You frustrate me. What do you mean? I'm wondering if you're... like me. That's why this is so frustrating. Hey. Han Tae-ju, get off me. Let's find out. What the hell? Hey, stop. What's going on? Shouldn't you be in class? - Who are you? - I'm Kim Pil-hyeon. And I cut class all the time. Are you the girl Guk is seeing? Hey, leave them alone. They're fighting now. They're fighting? I don't know. Just go. We're supposed to eat this together. Do you have to eat that with him now? Damn it! Tae-ju is whining about getting hit, isn't he? What's with that weirdo? You also think Tae-ju is a weirdo? My gosh. You too? You're kind of charming. You're kind of interesting. Is that a compliment? Just leave them alone. I told you they're fighting. Just give it to him another time. How about you eat it with me? People will see us. Let's go. Hey, are you wearing your pants backwards? No! - You are. - No, I'm not. Wait, is this the back side? I told you they fought. Hello... Gosh, I thought you were a customer. The restaurant is always so quiet. Are we going to be okay? It was busy at lunchtime. Congratulations. - Mom. - Yes? It's common to get jealous even in friendship, right? Of course, it happens all the time. It's common, right? I think I've done it too. - Yes, I have. - Why do you ask? Are Guk and Tae-ju pulling jealousy antics on each other or something? Gosh, they're just so cute. Oh, please. I'm not in the mood for jokes. You're lucky to have something you want to do. Want to spar with me? Got a death wish? I have to say, I regret doing that earlier. Why did you do that? "Stop provoking me, okay? Seriously, please. Tae-ju. I asked you not to do this." - What's this about? - Don't change the subject. Why did you do that? You're the one who said we must always talk things out to stay friends for life. We can't stay friends if we talk about this. Every time I see you with Choi Hye-mi, I get so pissed off. At first, I thought I was just jealous as a friend, but I like you. I want to be with you all day. When I'm with you, I want to hold you. And I want to whine when you're not looking at me. Enough, seriously. I'm reaching my limit in putting up with your whining. You know, you're being like this because you think of me as your mom. Don't delude yourself and piss me off like this. Enough is enough, okay? You think I'm a kid who can't even differentiate the two? I know you're being mean to me on purpose right now. You always think whatever you want. Right. I've always been this way. So tell me, you stuck-up jerk. How do you feel about me? Say it. Whose loss will it be if I leave? You've been my patron all my life, so I bet you think it'll be my loss. But you know what? You're wrong. I can live without you, but you can't. That's not what I'm asking though. Hear me out first. Out of the past 15 years, that one week you spent in Japan... was when I felt freest and happiest. Then go tell my dad now. That looking after me has been so damn exhausting. And that he'd better pay you before you expose everything I've done. Go tell him. Okay? Right. You've always been wiser than I am, so I'm sure you're right again this time. I'll give you a month. Leave before the month is up. CHOI HYE-MI Where's Tae-ju? At home. Sorry I left without saying anything earlier. It's okay. Ta-da. What do you think? It's your guardian angel. My guardian angel? I made this for you. Isn't it so cute? Yes, it's cute. Here, take it. You don't have anyone who protects you, right? I don't want to see you stressed out. - Hye-mi. - Yes? I'm not stressed out. To be honest, looking after Tae-ju isn't stressful at all. And... I'm sorry. You asked me if I had feelings... My mom was right. What? I don't want to accept it, but I had an inkling all along. Your eyes. Even when you were looking at me, I felt as though you were staring elsewhere for some odd reason. Please leave your message after the tone. When you're done, hang up or press... Tae-ju. Hey, don't pull a prank on me. Tae-ju. Tae-ju! Han Tae-ju. Please leave a message after the tone. Sir. I think Tae-ju has been kidnapped. I can see his most recent location, but his phone is off. I'm sorry, sir. I'll go to where his phone was last pinged. Hey, Pil-hyeon. Did Tae-ju call you by any chance? No. Why? What's up? Hey. We should meet. I can't meet up now. It's about Tae-ju. Hey, Guk. What's going on? I'm not too sure, but... Tell me what's going on. I didn't think things would get to this. Tell me what the hell is going on unless you want to be beaten up. I told his father. That I saw... you guys kissing in the field out back. The chairman ordered my dad to... Well, I've been watching you guys. I know I sound like a loser, but my dad would've gotten fired otherwise. I'm sorry. Thank God. What? That means the chairman took him. I'm relieved. Tae-ju is moving to the U.K. I'm sorry, dude. I didn't intend for this to happen. But don't tell him I told his dad. It'll put me in an awkward situation. Damn... That freaking hurt! Loser. Kim Pil-hyeon, you're a piece of trash. I shouldn't have let you two move out on your own. Please don't beat up Guk. He doesn't feel the same way. So it's just you? I had a one-sided crush on him. You moron. I shouldn't have raised you in the first place. You're right. You always fail. You're such a wimp because you take after your mother. Do not speak about Mom that way. Guk is here, sir. Let him in. Guk, I thought you were doing a pretty good job as Tae-ju's bodyguard. I'm sorry, sir. Explain to me why you came all the way here of your own accord. I know I can never win against you, sir. I have nothing, but you... You have everything. That's right. You obviously know better, yet you're letting one reckless mistake... completely ruin your future. I came to talk to him for five minutes. We were always together for the past 15 years. We should at least talk for five minutes. I told you Guk will get beaten up when you do anything wrong. I'll go. I'll move to the U.K. And? I'll move there... all by myself... and study hard to get into college. I'll do that. But how can I trust you? I'll leave first thing tomorrow. I promise I won't disappoint you. Trust me, just this once. Please, I'll prove it to you. Book Tae-ju's flight for tomorrow and proceed accordingly. But please... allow me a moment. Just tonight. Let me go home. I freed you. Why come back? You know the answer. I don't want to move to the U.K. I'm sorry. Kim Pil-hyeon, that nutjob. I want to beat him to a pulp. Where did the time go? It's almost dawn. I'm not sure when it began, but I've been wanting to hold you. I like you. Jeez. You're confessing your feelings knowing that I have to leave in a few hours? Have a good flight... to the U.K., Tae-ju. Gosh, you should've just accepted my kiss that day. We never even got to kiss. Hey. I'm not a pervert. Why would I kiss someone whose lips are bleeding? We'll meet again, right? Find a good tteokbokki place. I'll be back. No, don't. We have different paths laid out for us. - Just stay there and enjoy... - My dream is... to live a happy life, but I'm happiest when I'm with you. So I will come back. I'm telling you. He's really handsome. What if it's totally packed again? Gosh, those eyes when he smiles! - He smiles with his eyes? - Yes! Wait, let me put on some lipstick. Hey. They're leaving. Hey, we should hurry. TOGETHER BEST TTEOKBOKKI How do I look? You look pretty. - You look pretty too. - Come on. My gosh! Here, Hye-mi. Okay. Here's your tteokbokki. Hey, greet your customers. Come on in. I love you. Me too. I never wanted a tteokbokki place that is this busy all the time. Oh, please. Don't talk such nonsense. Hey, Guk. Are you really going to leave? Yes, I have to. But my question is, why Japan? Just because. I've always wanted to visit. When will you be back? When my mind can be free of the internal chatter. My dear handsome Guk, I'm so sad I won't see you around. How am I going to live now? Oh, dear. How am I going to live with just this brat? Mom, please. Oh, right. - No. - Just take it. I'm paying you for helping us out. Thank you, ma'am. Hyem! Gosh, what a pain. Hey, I've been waiting for this day. - Then... - I didn't like having you around Hye-mi. I have to say, Guk is much more handsome than Pil-hyeon. And he's more prudent. Ma'am. Hey. Where's my gift? I did order something, but it hasn't arrived yet. - Sorry, dude. - Jeez. How's college? Fun? I don't know. We always learn weird stuff. Should I also go study abroad? Are you an idiot? Take good care of yourself, prick. You'd better call me often. Hey, that means "It's been a long time" in Japanese. Have you not seen him in a while? Bye. My dear Guk... He's like a delicate flower. How is he going to live on his own? That prick is not weak, ma'am. Damn it. Does he really have to leave? Did you call Tae-ju? Yes. What did he say? Did he not say much? I don't even know. I told him Guk was moving to Japan, but he didn't say anything. Hold on. He should be here any minute now. Hello, I'm here for the interview. Damn it. That guy is going to steal my spot now. You didn't turn off the location tracker. You sappy loser, why come all the way here? My gosh. You've gotten more handsome. Hey. So you're moving to Japan? I told you to find another tteokbokki place. Why are you running away? You sure took your time to return. If you're running away, we should go together. That was our wish, you know. JANG EUI-SOO HAN GI-CHAN JEON JAE-YOUNG, CHOI KYU-RI Subtitle translation by Liya Choi
