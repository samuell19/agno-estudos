HEY, CITIZEN, HURRY TO THE DEMONSTRATION OF "THE BEDBUG" IT'S A "TAIL" OF PEOPLE NEAR THE TICKET WINDOW AND A CROWD INSIDE THE THEATER. BUT DON'T BE MAD ABOUT THE INSECT'S JOKES, THEY'RE NOT ABOUT YOU BUT ABOUT YOUR FRIEND. MAYAKOVSKY LAUGHS THE EXTRAVAGANZA COMEDY BASED ON "THE BEDBUG" AND "FORGET ABOUT THE FIREPLACE" OF V. MAYAKOVSKY Hello, comrades. FILM-DRAMATURGE ALEXEY KAPLER First of all, I want to explain, why am I standing here. I was invited by my friends, directors Sergey Yutkevich and Anatoliy Karanovich, to take part in this film as, well, let's say, a witness, a contemporary of Mayakovsky. And now, when monuments are erected in honor of Mayakovsky, when in schools they study Mayakovsky, rather, they "pass" Mayakovsky, it's very difficult to imagine what the poet was during his lifetime, what kind of storms were raged around him. It seems I can still hear this... this storm at Polytechnic Museum, this howling and roaring of his enemies, shoutings of his friends when he performed. Mayakovsky was fearless, he took the blow and hit back outright. We, young people, loved him infinitely. He was our standard. Before I agreed with the directors about my participation in this film, I asked: "Well, and if I wouldn't like something in the film, do I have the right to say this to the audience or should I praise everything?" They answered: "Say whatever you like". Thus, we agreed. So I found myself in this pavilion of the film studio, here there are everything you need to shoot and sound the film. Looking around, here you can see the lighting equipment, microphones and the shooting equipment. And at the top you can see something that looks like a captain's cabin, this is the place for sound engineers. So if you hear me badly now, it's their fault. In short, here you are surrounded by the cinema equipment, which in the days of Mayakovsky couldn't even dream of. The main character of this film is the embodiment of petty bourgeois - Prisypkin, or Pierre Skripkin, this is how he elegantly renamed himself. Mayakovsky believed that petty bourgeois are his mortal enemy and he fought against it with the full force of his genius. Of course, we understand that now there's nothing to fight against and there's no need for that because petty bourgeois is over forever. It didn't remain at all. Well, maybe just barely noticeable manifestations. Some car will rush along the street, with a doll on the radiator, with balloons and colored ribbons on the sides of it. And in this car there's a pompous Prisypkin with a girl in a white veil. Doesn't Prisypkin want an elegant life? Doesn't he want a prestigious car and meet with celebrities? To be serious, there are much more dangerous manifestation of petty bourgeois, of "prisypkinism". Because Prisypkin is the same classic character as Tartuffe, Khlestakov or Rasplyuev, for example. I want to tell you, comrades, not to be surprised that in this film with the live actors you will see dolls, animation, all this mixed together. This is an experimental film. Mayakovsky once said: "The main thing depends on the width of the director's actions". Our directors acted very widely. Let's see what happened of it. Now let's get acquainted with the actors. A completely new actor is invited to the role of Prisypkin. He worked in a variety studio and never acted in films. And to find out how he is suitable for this role, we made a screen test, based on the scenario of Mayakovsky, "Forget about the fireplace". Let's see this screen test. Hey you, clyster soul! Give me the sick leave. But you're not sick. Am I? You're absolutely healthy. Healthy? It's tickling. Tomorrow I'll be sick. I'm always sick the next day after payday. Comrade doctor, close your hospital, we all go to the community work day. And you pay a membership fee for the "Russian Autoroads". You haven't paid for six months. Haven't I? And what is this? IOARF - have paid. SADACC - have paid! "Down With Illiteracy"? "Down With Illiteracy"? Please take it! Not enough for you, huh? The "Russian Autoroads"! You won't get anything! You're snakes! You're flayers! You want to take away my salary: "Take it out and put it here!" Don't you touch me, Why should I pay these fees? What did I fight for? What did I fight for? What did I fight for? Who goddamn knows! If you're responsible, this and that, Then you have to pay for everything. Oh, no, my dear, look for another fool! And I say, "Good luck", and was gone. And I say, "Good luck", and was gone. They will pounce on me and begin to embarrass me. Well, don't care about them, I don't want to know them. It's not the th year, I can afford it. I'll get what I...! I'll get what I...! I'll get what I fought for! We go together, shoulder to shoulder. We build roads, but what have I to do with it? Oh, no, my dear, look for another fool! And I say, "Good luck", and was gone. And I say, "Good luck", and was gone. What do you think? I think this is a suitable candidate. This actor's name is Yuri Chernov. Let me introduce him to you. Gee! And where is Chernov? Chernov is not there, he's late again. Again? He's always late! - I'll find him. - Okay. You know, comrades, we could re-shoot this scene with Chernov, but I'd like to show you... Hello! Sorry, I'm late. But it's not my fault. Our concert was far away and we had problems with transport. You should apologize not to me, but to Iya Sergeevna Savvina. She always comes on time and you made her wait. Let's get acquainted. I'll be your partner in this film. I'll play the role of Zoya Beryozkina, and in the course of the plot, I'll have to fall in love with you. Thank you. Oh, sorry... Yura. Attention, all be prepared for the dubbing of the episode "Hostel"! It seems I forgot the text at home. I have a lot of concerts, so I forgot about it. But I remember the musical parts! It's okay, I'll help you. This episode exactly repeats the text of the play. You should remember that play. We studied Mayakovsky at school, but not "The Bedbug". But I studied "The Bedbug", Alexey Yakovlevich. But I have a question. At the very beginning of the play, Zoya Beryozkina appears only for a moment, and I, as an actress, don't have time to understand about the nuances of the relationships between Zoya and Prisypkin. Where did they meet? How did they spend their time? Where does Zoya work? Mayakovsky as a journalist will answer these questions better than me. He wrote "The Bedbug", using newspapers materials. And he has one saying: "Together with me, this play was written by the Komsomol and 'Komsomolskaya Pravda'". I suggest you to take advantage of your actor's imagination and imagine yourself as Zoya Beryozkina in that distant epoch. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA GO FORWARD MORE CONFIDENTLY, COMRADES! Worker Prisypkin calls himself Pierre Skripkin. He met artists who said he looked like Harry Piel. After that, he began to go to the cinema more often. He grew his whiskers, that prevented him from washing his face. And he, wanting to keep the beau monde, badly washed himself for a month. THE LASSALLE'S PLANT Everybody to the community work day! SUMMER CLUB TODAY AT CLUB Report on the international situation And after - LIVING NEWSPAPER of Trade union council called "BLUE BLOUSE". TODAY IN CINEMA: Harry Piel's "Der Mann ohne Nerven" And yet, I can't understand. I can't understand. She is a Komsomol member, a young girl. And she fell in love with this Prisypkin? It's unbelievable. Zoya was young, naive. And he had a powerful instrument of seduction - a guitar. Mayakovsky hated vulgar things, and he called people like Prisypkin "romance-voiced" ones. Mayakovsky mocked the popular romance called "Forget about the fireplace". So he gave one of his scripts the same name. I learned the romance of Prisypkin. Can I sing it? The moon hid behind a cloud - It again goes out for a walk. Let me put your white-white hand To my red heart. My feelings, dreams and fantasies Were again lit up in my heart like a flame, - I deserved a private life for myself In the battles with the world bourgeoisie. He leaved her inâ€¦exactly In fifteen days of use. For reason that she had no Enameled leather shoes. When you put, so trustingly, Your little fingers on my palm, You can't even imagine That you put them on fire. It's impossible to live without tenderness, It's easy to ruin this tenderness. Let me love your black-black eyes With my red soul. - Why so late? - Hi! - Are you all set? - Yes. My boys are in a hurry, so let's start. But we first need to make an episode of "Hostel". Baby, we need to mount everything. Stop, stop, stop! Forgive me, comrades, but I have to stop the action, because there are two new and very important characters. One of them is Bochkin, who chose a pseudonym Oleg Bayan. He's a rascal, the ideologist of Prisypkin, his "home-bred Mephistopheles". He preach temptations of elegant life. By the way, after the play "The Bedbug" appeared, there was a scandal around Bayan's name. The fact is that then there was one real character, I knew him personally, he was a literary plagiarist and a fake poet. His name was Vadim Bayan. Of course, this is also a pseudonym. He was just Sidorov. So, this Sidorov accused Mayakovsky of the fact that Mayakovsky insulted his personality. He said that Oleg Bayan in "The Bedbug" has a lot, as he said, of "parallels and signs" with him. Mayakovsky replied: "If you don't like it, change your name". This "Bochkin-Bayan" was played by Leonid Sergeyevich Bronevoy. To be precise, he played two roles: He plays Oleg Bayan from the "New economic policy" epoch and the modern mediocre actor Bochkin. Galina Borisovna Volchek also plays two roles. At first she plays Madame Renaissance, the future mother-in-law of Prisypkin. from the "New economic policy" epoch. And then she plays a mediocre actress, who performing with Bochkin. They both voice themselves. They voice their animated drawings, because the cinema could revive the drawings, but the drawings can't speak with human voices themselves yet. Even now, in the era of the scientific and technological revolution. I apologize to the actors for interrupting their acting, and I ask them to start the scene from the beginning. Why so late? Look at the clock! - Hi! Are you all set? - Yes. Okay, my boys are in a hurry, so let's start. No, we first need to make an episode of "Hostel". Baby, we need to mount everything. The boys today have two more gigs. So these puppeteers will wait. Give me sheets, baby! Faster! Faster! Come on! Come on! Instruments are in order! Tempo! Tempo! What about you? Warm up!

Oleg Bayan will arrange everything just like in Paris, Oleg Bayan advises you with good intent: Grab the piece that lies closer to you, Until somebody grab it before you. Wait till you're my age, my dear. They will deceive you many times - Ask Madame Renaissance about it - Because there are all sorts of crooks at this place! This is a wonderful private trade around, This is fair trade, who will beat whom? We don't need too much from others - No, we don't need too much!

Just press your thumb against your index finger And you won't ever lose your pants, citizens! Dutch press studs! They sew themselves on! Twenty kopecks for half a dozen! Here you are, monsieurs! Buy them, Rosalia Pavlovna. In our Red family there must be no petty bourgeois squabbles over fly buttons. And Comrade Prisypkin's pants must be like a horn of plenty... He is the victorious class and he sweeps away everything in his path, like lava! I'll take them and it won't cost you. The best republican herrings! Indispensable with every kind of vodka! Yes! Salted herrings! Now that's something for the wedding, I'll sure take some of them. How much is this sprat? This salmon costs two-sixty the kilo. Two-sixty for this overgrown minnow? Only two-sixty for this budding sturgeon! For these marinated corset stays! For this real whale! Two-sixty! Two-sixty for this sprat? Two-sixty! For this overgrown minnow? Two-sixty! For these marinated corset stays? Did you hear that, Comrade Skripkin? Oh, how right you were to kill the Tsar, our imperor! Oh, how right you were to drive out Mr. Ryabushinsky! I shall claim my civic rights and buy my herrings in the Soviet State public cooperation! The best republican herrings! Indispensable with every kind of vodka! Comrade Skripkin, why get mixed up with petty bourgeois elements and haggle over herrings in such a controversial form? I beg you not to worry, There is no reason for this. Give me half a liter of vodka And the tail of herring, And fifteen more rubles... Then the wedding will be a success. Yes! Comrade Bayan... I'm against all this petty bourgeois stuff - like canaries and other... I'm a man with higher needs. What I'm interested in is a wardrobe with a mirror... Whales! Whales! Whales! Dolphins! Now then, show me that snail! A whole tail's lenght longer! A whole tail's lenght longer! A whole tail's lenght longer? What did we fight for? Oh, why did we kill the Tsar, our emperor? What did we fight for? Oh, why did we throw out Mr. Ryabushinsky? Where will I find my civic rights and will buy herrings? This Soviet regime of yours will drive me to my grave! My dear Rosalia Pavlovna, try comparing them at the other end. They're only bigger by a head and what do you need it? You can't eat this head. You'll cut it off and throw it out! Did you hear what did he say? If I cut off your head, Comrade Bayan, it will be no loss to anyone. But if I cut off this herring's head I lose ten kopecks to the kilo! This is a wonderful private trade around, This is fair trade, who will beat whom? We don't need too much from others - No, we don't need too much! This is a wonderful private trade around, But each of us is very honest. We are modest people and if you pay, We'll sell you everything, everything! We'll sell you everything, everything!

HOSTEL "RED MODE OF LIFE" Attention, get ready for shooting the episode "Hostel". Action! Episode "Hostel", take one. Puppeteers, action! Where are my boots? Someone's swiped my boots again! They're here. Prisypkin took them to go see his lady-love, his she-camel. The trash he leaves behind him is kind of more refined nowadays. It used to be empty beer-bottles and fish-tails. Shut your trap! The kid buys a new tie and you curse him like he was Ramsay MacDonald. That's just what he is! The new tie don't matter. Trouble is that he's tied to the tie - not the tie to him. Friends, help me to conduct a great experiment. I use the latest techniques to fight against absenteeism! Today he quit his job. He marries a daughter of a barber, Now Mademoiselle Elzevira Renaissance will cut his nails. Got pretty cozy! Maybe you just envy him? Do you think you're Karl Liebknecht? If someone beckons you, you surely would leave too! What a hero! This isn't . People want to live their own lives now. Attention, in a minute Prisypkin should noisily awake! Don't pay attention to this rude jokes, Comrade Skripkin, it will only spoil the refined taste that is awakening in you. Who is this? This is his teacher, who taught him to do his hair. He now teaches young people, to write poetry and to dance. He just borrows money from some of them. A man of such talents like you, Comrade Skripkin, just doesn't have elbow room in Russia, what with capitalist encirclement and the building of socialism in one country. You need a world revolution, you must break through into Europe. Once you've smashed world bourgeoisie, you will delight the Moulin Rouge and the Pantheon with the beauty of your bodily movements. The first tango after the nuptial ceremonies is the most crucial step in life - it should leave a deathless impression. Well, take a few steps with an imaginary lady. That's right! Tread softly like you were coming back from a saloon on a moonlit night... full of sadness and dreams. Oh, you are so beautiful, my tango, It's hard with people, but it's easy with you. Don't wriggle your hind-parts! You're supposed to be leading your mademoiselle, not a pushcart! I was just scratching myself. Oleg Bayan knows women, no doubt. Oleg Bayan advises you with good intent: If you want to kiss, do it only after the engagement, But if you want to do this before, then you'll have problems. Vanya, how so? So that's it? Our love is liquidated. "We part like ships in the sea..." Van'ka, aren't you ashamed? You need to leave this woman. Why don't you cut it out? Vanya, how so? We wanted to live! We wanted to work! Don't interfere with my free civil feeling! Otherwise I'll call the militia. ZOYA BERYOZKINA'S SHOT HERSELF Don't be sad, Iya Sergeevna. Zoya had a clumsy love. And just as clumsily she tried to commit suicide. Therefore, in the second half of the film, you'll meet your character again. You should never forget: don't put on two ties at once - particularly if they're different colors. And remember, you can't wear a starched shirt outside your pants! Especially for a wedding. The tramcars drew up to the Registry Office, Bringing the guests to a Red marriage service. Dressed in his working clothes was the spouse And a union card stuck out of his blouse! Ah, the guests are respectable and prominent, Prominent! And mother-in-law is imposing and significant, Significant! The bride is rosy and drunk, Drunk! But not because of wine. Let's begin, Skripochka? Wait a little more. I wished to get wed in an organized fashion - in the presence of the guests of honor, and particularly in the presence of the secretary of our factory committee, respected Comrade... Lassalchenko. Yes! My dear bride and bridegroom, please forgive me for being late and allow me to convey to you the congratulations of our leader, Comrade Lassalchenko. "Tomorrow", he says, "I would even go to the church. "But today is a Party meeting. "And like it or not, I have to go to the Party cell..." I hereby declare the wedding open. Comrades and Monsieurs, please eat! Where would you find pigs like these nowadays? I bought this ham three years ago in a case of a war but there's still no war! And the ham is getting moldy... Please eat! Respected citizens! Beauty is the motive force of progress! What would I have been as a simple worker? "Bochkin" - and nothing more. What could "Bochkin" do? Mooch? And nothing more. But as "Bayan" I can do anything. I'm glad, I'm happy, We all are happy. My friend Pierre Skripkin, Our friend, our monsieur, At the moment Path full of struggle, He lost only his professional ticket But he found so much. When we suffered being under the yoke Together with the working class, Together with Comrade Friedrich Engels, And with Comrade Marx, Could we dreamily assume Or at least assumedly dream, That we'll combine in a beautiful marriage Self-sacrificing work And defeated capital. Oleg Bayan, everybody knows him, Oleg Bayan, he doesn't need to introduce himself. Oleg Bayan, he combines a lot of talent and charm. Pour him a glass of champagne. Oleg Bayan is drunk with happiness! Beauty is pregnant... Pregnant? Who said "pregnant"? Watch your language in the presence of the newlyweds! A romance. "Makarov's Lament for Vera Kholodnaya". At a time when flowers are being collected, At a time when dreams come true, Tell me just one word, And you will be in my heart again, Only you. And you will be in my heart, Only you. FIRE STATION COMRADES AND CITIZENS, VODKA IS POISON DRUNKS CAN EASILY BURN UP THE REPUBLIC This is the end of the first part of the film. All were burnt. And an elegant life, too. However, among the victims there was no Prisypkin. They decided that he had burnt and forgot about him. In fact, Prisypkin, along with his seven-stringed "girlfriend" froze and frozen into the ice floe because of the fire hoses water. Now you'll see what happened next. And now let's say that we're done with information and we can look around. We're on Mayakovsky Square. A person very quickly gets used to the words. Mayakovsky Square. This is the holy place of Soviet art. Here on the right, where is now the Tchaikovsky Hall, previously, there was "TM", Theater of the famous Soviet director Meyerhold, who staged all the plays of Mayakovsky. If you look a little to the right, there used to be a circus, then a music hall, and now it's the Satire Theater, there you can watch Mayakovsky's plays even now. And here, in the center of the square, there was a simple tram stop. On the Garden Ring, to one side, went "the Bug". It was called so. Tram "B". And along Gorky St., the former Tverskaya-Yamskaya St., went other trams. And there, opposite from here, was their stop. These trams had no doors so you could jump in there or jump out. At that time trams were liberal. On the Garden Ring there were trees. In fact, the entire Garden Ring was a big single... green boulevard. And on this boulevard one could often meet Mayakovsky who was going to the Meyerhold Theate for the rehearsals of his plays. Actually, it was hard to imagine Moscow without Mayakovsky, who was walking its streets. He was tall, taller than the rest. Wide-shouldered, wider than the rest. He was handsome, very handsome man. In "The Bedbug" he wrote about the future, but even a genius can't imagine the future as absolutely real. And he couldn't imagine this Mayakovsky Square either. And his monument too. It's known that Mayakovsky didn't like monuments. But we need this monument, not him. And Mayakovsky definitely couldn't imagine that there'll be "Mayakovskaya" metro station. "You go out on the 'Mayakovskaya'?" - asking somebody as simply as he would have asked in the 0s: "Hey, coachman, how much will it cost "to get to Sadovo-Triumphalnaya?" ie, the current Mayakovsky Square. The station "Mayakovskaya". Above us is the Sun, the Sun and the Sun. Rejoice, all you who are strong, workshop of the creators of the world and workers. Warm up, the Sun! Play, the Sun! Burn, our Sun! Enthusiasm, go grow and expand! Plants, go shine iridescent! Today we are building socialism - It's alive, real, true one. Warm up, the Sun! Play, the Sun! Burn, our Sun! THE FUTURE GENERATION FINDS FROZEN PRISYPKIN AND DECIDES TO RESURRECT HIM I've slept it off! Forgive me, comrades, I was boiled, of course. What militia station is this? I always can prove my identity. I've got my documents with me. IOARF - have paid. SADACC - have paid! "Down With Illiteracy" - please take it! And what is this? A marriage certificate... Right, I married yesterday. Where're you? Who's kissing your finger tips? There'll be hell to pay at home! Here's my union card. All my unpaid union dues! What day is today? The forms... They'll ask the forms! Local Committee... District Committee... My God! My wife! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Where am I? Where did you put me? Automobiles! Automobiles! Coachman! Automobiles of the future amazed a defrozen mammal. This pure example of petty bourgeoisie got into a new world. Hello! Hello! This is the President of the Institute for Human Resurrection. I want to inform you about new circumstances related to the amazing experiment. This is the return of the frozen creature to life. I'll read the resolution! Moved by sanitary-inspection stations of the metallurgical and chemical enterprises of the Donbass: In view of the danger of the spread of the bacteria of arrogance and sycophancy, we demand that the exhibit remain in its refrigerated state. I want to say! This is the opinion of the majority of the members of the Academic council of our institute. Time that goes very quickly will sweep away and cut away the heavy ballast. Ballast of those who devastated by unbelief. The future will accept all those who have at least one trait that ties the person to the collective: the joy of work, the desire to sacrifice, the indefatability of inventing, the ability to share humanity. Owing to certain mimetic characteristics, this ressurected mammal should be representative as homo sapiens. My colleague Dr. Beryozkina is mistaken. By comparative bestiology, I was convinced that we're dealing with... with a dangerous anthropoid simulator. And that this is... the most remarkable of parasites. In the not too distant time, in the mattresses of time there were only two types. They're different in size, but identical in essence: the famous bedbugus normalis and bourgeoisius vulgaris. The difference between them was that bedbugus normalis, having gorged itself on the body of a human, falls under the bed. And bourgeoisius vulgaris having gorged itself on the body of all mankind, falls onto the bed. Give me a drink... I made you breakfast. We give this only to cosmonauts and investigators of the sea depths. Try it. It's very delicious. I don't need your breakfast! Please, give me a drink. It's good that I envisaged this relapse. Cognac "Cosmos". It gives you energy, and has the same taste as French "Napoleon". You can drink it at work and when you're sunbathing by the sea. One hundred percent lack of alcohol. Like giving lemonade to an elephant. You ressurect me and now you make fun of me! Give me a drink! Give me a drink! Indeed, this is an amazing parasite. The dispute about his future fate arose not only among scientists, but also among me and directors of this film. There was a so-called confrontation between us. The thing is that in "The Bedbug" everything ends as follows: people of the future, that is we are, put this anthropoid creature to a zoo cage. And I thought that this is how this film should end. However, the directors decided to transfer Prisypkin to another world. A world where there is still a elegant life and where such people as Skripkin and Bochkin live perfectly. In response to my doubts, they referred to Mayakovsky. He really said that he would insert into the play "Facts about the philistinistic bastards of the past and the future. "Recent political and domestic news". It's known who is in charge in the film. The directors. And they decided to do it their own way. I'm not responsible for it. GIVE US AN ELEGANT LIFE (EPISODE TWO) GIVE ME...! GIVE ME...! ...A DRINK! GORBLIMY! SO WHAT CAN I CHOOSE FROM ALL THIS TO DRINK?

I'll live in a barrel, but I'll be free. So I could grow my hair long. I'll live in a barrel, but I'll be free. So I could grow my hair long. And we also have to live this way. Brothers, our time has come! And other classes, the bosses and the masses, Will go bald without us! And other classes, the bosses and the masses, Will go bald without us! Hasten to buy the elixir "Diogenes" - And your hair will be long up to the knees. I'll sing, I'll numb and begin to cry. When you're with me, I become drunk without wine. It's impossible to escape from fate with laughter, Once I start playing the guitar, you'll be mine. We live once and die once, Kiss me and don't be sad, why should we get married? All the horses left, they raced away, I'm at saloon and the sadness eats my soul. Hey, beautiful, just wait for me, Let me get a drink and I'll be yours. I'll sing, I'll numb and begin to cry. When you're with me, I become drunk without wine. I'll sing, I'll numb and you'll be mine! Let's get drink some. Let's get drink some. Oh, you horses, my beautiful horses, How far have you ridden off me? Oh, you horses, are you far or near me? Let's get drink some. Let's get drink some. We live once and die once... Come on, sing it! Kiss me and don't be sad, why should we get married? A man of such talents like you, Comrade Skripkin, just doesn't have elbow room with the conditions of the socialist system. You must break through into Europe. Dear journalists! Let me introduce you to Mr. Skripkin. He escaped from the socialist paradise. And as a sign of protest against the oppression of a free individual... he changed the vulgar nickname "Ivan" to a beautiful name "Pierre". I'm pleased to announce to you that Mr. Skripkin signed a contract with our famous firm, and now he will sing to the glory of "Diogenes" and the entire free world! Comrades! Citizens! Brothers! I'm one of you! We all are parts of one folk...! Gentlemen! Misters! Monsieurs! I'm just an artist!
