[seagulls squawking] [engine rumbling] [dramatic music] [water splashing] [engine rumbling] [horns honking] [traffic whizzing] [engine revving] [tyres squealing] [metal clanging] [tyres squealing] [car thuds] [tyres squealing] [car thudding] [horn honking] [engines revving] [car thuds] [tyres squealing] [car thuds] [engine revving] [car crashing] [glass shattering] - Coogan. [engine idling] [shot firing] [car doors slamming] [shots firing] [fire whooshing] [shots firing] [pensive music] - Let's go away together. Anywhere you like, for as long as you like. - [Jeff] You don't know anything about me. - I don't care. I'm leaving behind me everything I was until today. You do the same thing. Can you? Darling, why don't you relax? Let the warm sun sink into your skin. Nature is nothing but love. [music continues] [footsteps approaching] [gloves rustling] - Jeff? [door sliding] Jeff? [inmates chattering] - Weber sent you. He gets me out and I join The Organisation. That the idea? - No, Jeff. I came down here on my own. I heard you were in trouble. You know, you were somebody very special for me. You were my first client. - Okay, okay. Don't get uptight. It's just that I don't wanna owe those guys any favours. I'm glad to see you. - That sounds better. Now then, let's see how we can get you off this time. Tell me what happened. - Well, all you have to know is that I fired in self defense. The gun I used belonged to one of them. - Okay, but I'll have to tell the judge more than that. Jeff, why did they wanna knock you off? - Say it was a mistake. They thought I was some other guy. - You think that the judge will swallow that? Maybe if the girl who was with you testified that the gun wasn't yours, then- - What girl? No girl. I was alone. - What do you mean, Jeff? They saw her. - Well, Mr. Attorney, you find some people who didn't see her. All you have to say is that I fired in self defence and I was alone. - Jeff, this isn't the time or place to get sentimental. You're not the sentimental type. It's going to cost you too much to keep her out of it. - She won't be out of it. [eerie music] - Jeff? - Jesus Christ. What's he doing? He's crazy. [music continues] [foot stomps] [light clicks] [cellmate sighs] - You had to prove yourself a tough guy anyway, didn't ya? Even here. - What are you talkin' about? - I knew a guy once, and for 40 years he was a good husband, a good father, and a good citizen. One day, instead of going to the office, he bought himself an automatic pistol, stood on the corner of the street and just started shootin'. He killed three people. Well, everybody said he was crazy, but that wasn't so. He had just discovered his true calling. He was a natural born Killer. [eerie music] - $20,000. That's not bad, Jeff. Besides it's not really a crime. My uncle's 80 years old. 80! All it means is giving him one little push. You'll have no regrets. - I am a professional. [phone buzzing] - Hello? Who is it? - [Jeff] I'm a friend of your nephew's. He asked me to call you and warn you there's someone waiting to Kill you. - What? What do you mean? Who is it? Where is he? - [Jeff] He's waiting for you on shore. You can see him if you look out of your porthole. - Hello? Who is it? My God, I can't hear anything at all. Nothing. - I'm a professional. [shot firing] [eerie music] I looked at him. That's never happened to me before. For me, they've all been targets, nothing else. Why? Why did I look at him? [eerie music] - Did she play it dirty with ya? - That's enough, old man. You shut up now. [engine whizzing] [announcer chattering] - Welcome back. Come on, Jeff. The boss wants to talk to you. You're lucky. You just got out, and already we got a nice job lined up for ya. - I'm not workin' anymore. - $30,000, Jeff. - I said no. - For God sake, Jeff. $50,0007? - Hey, come here. This guy has a proposition for you. - What? [engine rumbling] - Hi, Jeff. Lined up like they're in uniform. They're just clerks nowadays. Killers with a time clock to punch in an old age camera. You were smart to say no, not to go with Weber's bunch. You're another kinda man altogether. You're like me, a free man. We like to think with our own heads, use our own hands. And when the crunch comes, you were there in person ready to risk our necks. [dog barking] [pedestrians chattering faintly] [upbeat music playing faintly] - What the hell are you doin'? You think a good deed a day will get into heaven? - No, heaven cost me a lot more than that. 50 bucks a day. Snow. The blind man's my connection. [engine rumbling] - Do some lookin' around for me. - Who do you wanna find? - [Jeff] Harry Coogan, Vanessa Shelton. [pensive music] [engine rumbling] I wanna know where they are. - Okay. - I wanna know right away. [engine rumbling] [gravel crunching] [kids chattering] [engine rumbling] Freddie? - That's right. Car's ready. It's over there. [car door slams] [engine rumbling] [anticipatory music] [band music playing] - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Michigan. We're about to begin the racing trials for the Canadian Americans or the Can-Am, usually known. The most famous names in automobile racing from all over the world are taking part in these trials. The crowd of fans' estimated at 40,000 gathered from every state of the union and all over Canada to follow heartbeat by heartbeat the progress of their heroes, and drill with them to every move in this exciting race. Sterling Ross himself as great British champion is here to direct the company, the district carrying out last second- [band music drowns out speech] 200 miles an hour on us. Let me see if I can spot a few of the famous names for you. There's Dennis Holt. [audience applauding] John Gleason, looking as confident as ever. [audience applauding] And Harry Coogan, fearless millionaire dedicated to his one great passion, racing. [audience applauding] [dramatic music] Now the cars are being moved into their starting positions. Start signal is given as the cars pick up speed. Ernie Moss, director of the competition, guides the circuit and decides the moment the accelerating cars will reach the speed at the beginning of the race. Maintenance crews treat these powerful machines with all the care deserved by any extremely delicate mechanism in this and all states of the union. The drivers watch every move with hawk-eyed interest, and above all, safe to use the machine. They know that each one of them is very close to demonstrating their skills at every dangerous bend right along the high speed straights. Where they make up any time, they might've lost on the curves. [helicopter engine whirring] [engine rumbling] [hooves clomping] [anticipatory music] As the cars reach their positions, we hear the sound of revving engines. Each driver sensitive to any irregularity in the tuning of his motor, strains to hear the familiar reassuring sound he knows so well. There are only a few seconds left now before the start. Tension increases in the crowd. For those of you who have just joined us, let me repeat that we are bringing you direct from Michigan, the Canadian-American racing trials. [engines revving] [men chattering] The drivers are now standing by at their places. [anticipatory music] [engines revving] [hooves clomping] Look at the way the cars are grouping like real thoroughbreds straight [indistinct]. All coiled up to spring ahead of the signal. [engines revving] [stop watch clicks] [metal clinking] [revving continues] [tyres squealing] [pensive music] [engines revving] [shots firing] [tyres squealing] [car crashing] [explosion booming] [upbeat music] [photo rips] - As far as she's concerned, nothin' doin'. I looked around, asked a lotta questions. Nobody knows a thing, or else they won't say anything. I'm sorry, Jeff. Listen, can I give you some advice? - No. - Well, I'll give it to ya anyhow. Forget that girl, Jeff. Go away. Get some sun, fresh air. It'd be good for you. If you really want me to, I'll go on lookin' for her. And if I find out anything, I'll let you know, but clear out, Jeff. Listen to me. Don't go hunting for more trouble. - I have to find her. Right now. [guests chattering] [gentle music] - [Woman] And I am sure dear friends, [speaking faintly] will come to talk to the appeal of this important human enterprise. These innocent little victims of poverty will have their faith in life restored when they have learned that they have [speaking faintly]... So, if you can feel in your heart to help us and help this cause today, give the money to the ladies, and pass this basket around when you can make your contribution. [audience applauding] [gentle music] [guests chattering] - Jeff! [engine rumbling] [car door slams] Oh, it's hopeless. You'll never believe me. It's terrible, really to be the way I am. I'm always getting things wrong. I was Coogan's girl when I met you. He was terribly jealous. He realised right away something had changed, so he had me followed and found out about us, about you. He realised who you were. He decided to use you to get rid of his uncle, and then have you wiped out and take me back. - Well, he got what he wanted. You went with him. - Yes, I went away with him. Well, what else could I do? It was only for a little while. I couldn't forget you, Jeff. I couldn't forget what he'd done to you. I left soon afterwards. [train horns blaring] [engine rumbling] [tyres squealing] [Vanessa gasps] [boat horn blaring] [car door slams] All right, I was wrong. I'm still wrong. I always am. It's just because I can't be by myself. Oh! We can start again. I'll leave everything behind me. Oh! Oh no, Jeff, no! [Vanessa gasping] No, Jeff, no! No! [Vanessa grunts] No. No, Jeff, not here. Oh [gasping]! Oh no, Jeff, no! No! No, not here! No, Jeff, no, not here! [Vanessa gasping] [men yelling] [punches thudding] Why is it whenever I'm with you, I always end up in the middle of blood and violence? - Well, it happens the whole city is full of blood and violence. You only see it when you're with me. Come on. [horns honking] [engines rumbling] [car door slams] [plane engine rumbling] [announcer chattering] - [Announcer] Flight 216, boarding passengers from concourse A&D number 1. For Kansas City and Omaha, and Minneapolis, St Paul, brought onto international flight 250, concourse AA. [announcer chattering] [whistle shrilling] [announcers chattering] - [Driver] This is for you. [engine rumbling] [travellers chattering] - Hello, darling. - Name's Heston. I have reservations for Miami. - Have a nice trip, Sir. - Thank you. - [Gate Agent] This was left for you, Mr. Heston. - Cancel. [upbeat music playing softly] ♪ Whoa ♪ [singing faintly] ♪ We can fool around ♪ [singing faintly] J We'll be all in town & [singing faintly] ♪ We'll be all about ♪ [singing faintly] ♪ Pieces will be found ♪ ♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪ ♪ Pieces will be found ♪ - [Jeff] What do you know about that? ♪ Pieces will be found ♪ - What kind of a joke you think this is? Jeff, you gone crazy? - This why, old friend? - Put that gun away. That girl's gone to your head all right, if you could even make you do this to me. I was the first one to put a gun in your hand, and then you come here threatenin' me. I'm the only friend you've got. [gun thuds] Don't forget that, Jeff. You can't just scratch me off your list. - I made a mistake. A man's gotta defend himself. - Against me? What do I know about this crap? I was with you, wasn't I? I helped you, didn't I? But I won't help you again. You can count on that. [door closes] [mellow music] [vocalist exhaling] [Freddie grunting] [metal clanging] [Freddie groaning] - Well, if you're gonna - No! - Take up photography- - No [groaning]! - Who sent you? [Freddie groaning] - All right, all right! - Who sent you? - I'm sorry. Don't kill me, don't kill me! No [groaning]. [Freddie gasping] No! Don'! No! Don't! - Cool it, Jeff. The girl was really heroic. Damn fool for no reason. We could've told you, Jeff, I ordered the pictures. I've been lookin' all over for ya. We wanna have a little chat about 'em. - Take it easy, Jeff. We're here to hand you a strictly personal invitation. - You know, Jeff, you're photogenic. Now you'll come with us, won't ya? Like I said, the boss wants to see ya. [engine rumbling] [golf cart engine rumbling] - [Steve] Hey, Jeff. - Hi, Steve. What a coincidence. - Not really. The club belongs to Weber. I come here a lot to play tennis and keep my weight down. But you? - [Man In Yellow] Weber wants to talk to him. - Ah. Go and tell Weber that he stopped for a word with me. He'll be along in a minute. - All right. He's over there in the Japanese sauna. Hurry up, Jeff. He doesn't like to be kept waiting. - What are you up to with Weber? - Nothin'. He wants to talk to me. - Listen, I know it's none of my business, but be careful with Weber. He doesn't take anything from anybody. He's accustomed to squeezing people like lemons, then he throws them away. I don't want him to do the same with you. - You worked for him. - Yes, but I use him, he doesn't use me. I'm a lawyer, Jeff. And it's normal for me to work with people like them. I have to convince them that certain methods, violent methods are out of date. They can't be used any longer. Jeff? I wanna make you a proposition. There's a deal on in Venezuela. It's a good business. Handled it myself. One of the latest purchases of The Organisation. I can arrange for you to leave right now. Don't go to Weber. - Well, I have to see him. Your reasons sound good, but he's got pretty good ones, too. - Jeff? I'm going to the office now. I'll be working late. Come and see me when you finish with Weber. - Okay. - Oh, remember, those who give the orders aren't always those who command. - Oh, I made you an offer and you turned it down, and you lied about it. You said you didn't wanna work anymore, but instead [chuckles] Coogan, pow. You shouldn't tell Daddy lies. You know, it all comes out in the end, Jeff. Especially if big daddy's a suspicious son of bitch like me. [Al chuckles] - That wasn't work. I did it for myself. And you shouldn't allow your feelings to get hurt so easily. - Hey, my feelings aren't hurt. It's just, I can't allow certain things. It's a matter of authority. The Organisation, I have to make myself respected. Otherwise the whole works, they fall apart. It was different in the old days. Than you just had to knock off one of the boys from time to time, not a small percentage, you know? Set an example. And that way everybody else would fall into line very, very nicely. With you young people today, you're all cynics. No, they don't care about anything, and they don't show respect. - I want that film. - And I want you to join our little family. - I've been an orphan all my life, Weber. I'm used to being alone. - [laughs] Well, even orphans get married. You know, you can't go it alone, especially nowadays. You gotta belong to somebody, a group, a party, a church. If you go alone, whoop, they crush ya. [hands slapping] No, none of my men would've gotten into the trouble that you did down in the Virgin Islands. I wouldn't have allowed it. You understand? Now, look, we're headin' for big things, my boy, you and I. The Organisation is changing in many ways. It's getting stronger, and it's getting cleaner. In fact, we're thinkin' of settin' up on a serious scale nationwide. We don't have time for no two bit killers anymore. And if by some rare chance we need somebody, well, then, we'll hire the champions like yourself, and nothin' less. So look, you'll have a regular salary, pension. You'll have all the freedom you want. Only if I call you, you come, yeah? Always. There's no divorce from our family. Remember that. - Yeah, I know all about that. And the harbour is full of people who didn't, underwater statuary. [Al laughs] - Oh! You've been readin' those detective stories. Jeff, you've been readin' the wrong kinda books. Hey, look, I wanna make ya happy. So if you say okay, I'll even hire this friend of yours. What's his name, Kill a in? - Kill a in, you can't hire. - Oh. Listen, the only reason he hasn't joined us 'til now, nobody asked him. If I want him, I take him, or anybody else. - I'll give you my answer tomorrow. - Hey. Now, wait. I haven't finished. [engine rumbling] You know, you might not believe this, Jeff, but sometimes I get homesick for the old days. Eh, you wouldn't understand that, you're too young. You're part of the Machine Age. You wouldn't know how beautiful it was [chuckles]. You see that bank, for example? You know, the first time I went in there, I had an automatic rifle, me and three other guys. We cleaned the whole joint out, and now I own it. I gotta preside over the board meeting [laughs]. You know, all a sudden it's a nuisance. In front of the bishop, it's a real pain in the neck. - That's the way Kill a in talks about the old days, only he didn't go to all that trouble to get a hold of what disgusts him so much. - All right, I'm ambitious, I admit it. And I get sentimental too, but sometimes I screw myself. Hey, you see that skyscraper? That's the new office building for the firm. You know something, Jeff? I worked a long time to be able to build that, to build something worthy of me. And now it seems I'm not worthy of it. These smart college boy directors I got workin' for me, they say, "Don't come around the office too much and show your face. It's not good." You understand? Seems that these big shots would rather not know I exist, and they're handlin' my firm. And that way they don't have to get their hands dirty, and they don't have to go to confession on Saturday. - I don't want to hear the story of your life. I got better things to do. Why don't you let me off at the taxi stand? - Relax, Jeff. Be my guest for just a little while longer, huh? [alcohol sloshing] [Al chuckles] There we go. So. Here, you try this. It's called the Moonlight Passion [chuckles]. It's the newest thing here. - No, I'm not thirsty. - Oh [chuckles]. So, Jeff, do you like my place? It costs more than an aircraft carrier. [chuckles] But I had to have it. [machine whirring] I've got a very, very demanding wife. You know something? Before she'd marry me, I had to buy her a million dollar country place. Hey, I'm not complainin'. She heard the law before the honeymoon was even over [chuckles]. You got a lotta of style. You know somethin', Jeff? I'm not what you call a novice, right? I've been around. But I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. She showed me more surprises, I mean, very, very pleasant ones. [gentle music] Oh. Boy, I forgot you knew her. She used to run around with you a couple of years ago, right? And then she dumped you for this guy, Coogan, when he got his inheritance? It's all right, Jeff, I squared it for ya. I mean, she dumped him too, and quickly, the minute she met me. You were smart to let her go. She's too lively. Now, you're young. You would've taken it too badly. As for me, as far as I'm concerned, when she goes off on one of these escapades, you know, I'm relieved. I'm an old man. I gotta rest every now and then. Oh, women, they're so beautiful. You know, they can be the biggest whores in the world, and yet they insist on propriety, on keeping up appearances. She goes off on one of these romantic weekends and she knows that if I object, she wouldn't move an inch. And yet, she comes back and she starts these, these scenes, telling all these lies, point out all these details. Oh, you know, in her own way, I think she's a great artist [chuckles]. Come on, let's drink to it, huh? Let's drink. Let's drink to the talents of my wife. - I told you I wasn't thirsty. Why the hell didn't you tell me? - You were in jail. I couldn't come there and tell you that your Vanessa had married Weber. And besides, I felt it was partly my fault. I got in touch with her during your trial, and she was with me when Weber saw her the first time. [upbeat music] [patrons chattering] I'm disobeying Jeff. He didn't want me to look for you. He doesn't need your testimony. - I was in love with him. It was terrible for me to find out he was a killer, a gangster. - Of course, he's a gangster. And you'll have to pay for it. But believe me, nobody is all white or all black. - The lovely Vanessa. You're a knockout tonight, darling. Tell me, have your ears been burning? [music continues] [chattering continues] There's a lot of talk about you going around. My radar picks up everything, you know? - [Vanessa] What do you mean? - Oh, have a look at my show next week. I'm going to be talking about your fiance, the gangster, Jeff Heston, and your vacation in the Virgin Islands. - I had nothing to do with that business. - Listen Shandy, if I were you, I would avoid talking about Ms. Shelton on television. Believe me, you'd be sparing yourself a lot of trouble. - The TV station belongs to him. Well, boss, what do you say? Are we afraid to talk about Miss Shelton's vacation in the Virgin Islands? - I adore lawsuits. When we arrived at our thousandth suit, I realised that Thomas' show was a hit. - Anything wrong, Steve? - Tom Shandy wants to mention Miss Shelton's name in his TV gossip show. - My show lives on news. I'm sorry, but when I've got a good story, I report it. You can bet on that. And I'm gonna tell this story, even if it costs me my job. [lighter lid clicks] - You've already lost your job. Is that right, Chairman? Chairman, is that right? This rash young man has lost his job. Is that right? I can't hear you, will you spell it out? Is that right? - Yes, Al. [music continues] All right, Steve, if you'll move your behind off that chair, I'll make Miss Shelton's acquaintance. - I'd better keep an eye on this situation. You're too dangerous, and Vanessa's too important. - You still haven't got her out of your mind, hey Jeff? But she's dangerous for you now. Forget about the past. It can't mean anything but harm for you. You decided to change your way of life. Well, do it, leave. Take my offer. You can start all over again. Give your future some kind of meaning. In a little while when the whole organisation is cleaned up, normal with legal activities in broad daylight, I might even be able to bring you back here, hm? [door closes] Hello? Mrs. Vanessa Weber, please. You don't know where I can reach her? No, thank you, it doesn't matter. [anticipatory music] - Thank you for coming, Jeff. Do you like it? It's my hideaway. Jeff, you gave me that. [glass clinks] On! [hand slaps] - No memories. Only yesterday, and no tomorrow. - I love you, Jeff. - [Jeff] Only this moment counts for what it's worth. - Oh, I love you. [Vanessa panting] I love you, Jeff. [moans] I love you, Jeff. I love you. [car door opens] [car doors slams] [engine turning over] - Where are you goin'? - I'm going to the store, darling. Country air makes you hungry, you know? [engine rumbling] [trunk slams] [shotgun loads] [bag thuds] [anticipatory music] [engine rumbling] [water splashing] Why are we stopping here? - I wanna do some huntin'. Come on. [birds chirping] [branches rustling] [gun cocks] - Jeff, if you're going to shoot me, please do it quickly. You found out about Weber, didn't you? He was the one that stopped us at the airport. And now he sent you out here to be rid of me. He put the gun in your hand, but you want to do it, too. You hate me. I could feel it when we were making love. I could feel how you hate me. Jeff, I only ask you one thing. Please do it quickly. I can't stand physical pain, you know that. [Vanessa gasping] [soft music] Just because it exists. You can't understand that, but you have your own way of being in control. I'm weak. Perhaps I'm sick, but to me then, he meant safety, strength. But I paid for it. Oh, Jeff, it's disgusting living with him, sleeping with him, feeling his heavy, greasy body on top of me. [eerie music] [gun cocks] - Jeff? [shot firing] [music continues] [crickets chirping] Is he one of Weber's men? - My friend, Kill a in. He's still carrying the price tag. [TV shots firing] [adventurous western music] I got news for you. [women on TV screaming] - Oh? What kinda news? - It's for the obituary column. [TV clicks off] - Now you and the boys go down to the Olympic Club, and wait for me there. I wanna be alone. Well, my boy, I can't say that you did wrong. Vanessa hadn't behaved well with you, and to be perfectly honest, she was beginning to behave badly with me, too. So, you can see, Jeff, why I'm not gonna be in mourning too long. I hate to sound cynical, but in the past two months, Mrs. Weber was beginning to stick her nose a little bit too much into Mr. Weber's business, and that's why I left you completely alone. I gave you a completely free hand. So, everything went well, did it? I mean, in your usual grand style? - Yeah, yeah. Fine for everybody, except for Paul Kill a in. - Kill a in? But Vanessa? - [Vanessa] I'm right here, Al. [pensive music] [door closes] - Oh, Jeff. Jeff, she did it to ya again. - Where are the photographs, the negatives? [music continues] The key. - She should have a set made, right, darling? - The key. Vanessa. [key clinks] - As you can see, the lady of the house is very, very well informed. You're makin' a big mistake, Jeff. Coogan, me and you, and now you've fallen for it all over again, and ya think you're the last of the series? She's usin' you. All she wants to do is plant her pretty little behind at that throne where I'm sitting right now. Turn that gun on her, Jeff, and I'll make ya out a check for $10,000,000 right now. - Are these the ones, Jeff? - [Jeff] Burn them. - Good girl. And now you'd better send her off, Jeff. Vanessa, she hates violence. Don't you, darling? - Okay. You remember everything, Vanessa? - Hotel Jericho, Ms. Brown. Hurry, darling. - Vanessa?? Goodbye. And congratulations. [door closes] [Al chuckles] Dear, dear little Vanessa. I gotta give her credit. She's got an awful lot on the ball, but you Jeff, you're a big disappointment to me. And it's funny. With her you seem to lose all your strength as if she's taken it all from you. I wanna tell you somethin', and I don't care if you believe me or not, but she's screwing you over all the time. Along with the negatives in that drawer, there was a copy of the prints, and she just snuck 'em out right in front of your very eyes. - Nah. If she had done that, you would've told me about it right away. - I find it more amusing. You wanna kill me don't you, Jeff? I might as well enjoy it. What's the matter? You lost the courage to pull the trigger? You have your doubts, your second thoughts. Let me tell you, Jeff, you're screwed for the rest of your life. You ate the apple and they're gonna throw you out of the Garden of Eden. And if you do anymore, killing your victim is gonna haunt you for the rest of your life. [shot firing] - What's the name of the hotel where you're supposed to meet Jeff? - [Vanessa] Why? Who are you calling? - The police, naturally. Well, what does that mean? - Wait, Steve. I can't do it. - What's wrong? Remorse? [smirks] Did those three days at the cottage heat up the old romance? I thought you were better than that. Can't you realise, if we don't have him arrested, he'll kill you. And by now he knows you're a bitch. - Of course I'm a bitch, but that's precisely why you've been able to sit comfortably in your chair and talk about law and justice. I was the one that was risking my skin out there. It was me that had to marry Weber. I was the one that had to go to bed with him. - I could have offered myself, but I don't believe Weber would've appreciated my charms, darling. At least I have one thing to my credit. I discovered you. I set the whole Vanessa mechanism in motion, the operation that means we now have a billion dollar organisation right in our hands. In any case, Jeff is finished. They have his name on their list. They'd catch him sooner or later. You know how many dead men he has on his conscience. - What about you? You're the one that wanted Weber killed. - [tongue clicking] We both did darling, but he won't be on our consciences. We just shifted the pistol's aim from you to him. Jeff was the one who pulled the trigger. The sooner it's over, the better it'll be for all of us, even for him. Where is he waiting for you? [engine rumbling] [car door slams] [guests laughing] [upbeat music] - Has a Ms. Brown checked in yet? - Ms. Brown? No, she hasn't. [guests chattering] [engine rumbling] [tyres squealing] [dramatic music] - [Officer] Back, there he goes! [music continues] [singer vocalizing] [tyres squealing] [vocalist exhaling] [singer vocalizing] - [Officer] This is car 23 reporting in. We're blocking intersection B right now. [vocalizing continues] [music continues] [pedestrians chattering] - I want squad 24 to close on in. [dispatcher chattering faintly] - It's official. - Send it out. - Number available. - Over. - Wrap it up. [dispatchers chattering] [lever clicking] - Calling all cars, calling all cars, attention. This here's top priority. Jeff Heston, he has been sighted west of Warren Street. [buzzer buzzing] [typewriter keys clacking] [gentle music] [glasses clinking] - [Steve] You know, you're beautiful? Even in clothes. - I know. There's no need for a toast in advance, Steve. There'll be lots of them afterwards. - It isn't for the ceremony. It's for us, to celebrate good news. It seems they've found him, or rather, identified him in Africa with mercenary troops. With a fake name, of course. One of the Nicholson agents told me. And I'm talking about Jeff, obviously. I wonder how he managed it, to get out of the States and reach Africa. - Then everything's all right. Africa's far enough away, isn't it? And dangerous enough. - I would've preferred a more definitive solution. - I like that word, definitive. It's very refined. But to me, it sums up a picture of Jeff twisting in the electric chair or riddled with machine gun bullets. - You frighten me, Vanessa. You agreed to betray him, but you're still possessed by that killer, with the smell of death on him. - I catch the same smell on you, Steve, only much stronger. At least he always took his own risks. It's people like you, like us if you want, who never risk anything. At least, almost never. - I have your speech for you. - I don't need that. I know what to say. Don't underestimate me, Steve. - You're learning fast, Vanessa, very fast, but you still need me. We've done everything together, and we'll make it together. But I was the brains, and I still am. Don't forget it. When we're able to get married once a decent period of mourning is over, you'll see where I'll be able to take you, how far we can go. - I know very well where I want to go, but I also know that I want to go there by myself. You were right, Steve. It's wonderful to be powerful, strong. But power can't be shared. It has to be held by one pair of hands. My hands, in this case. - Be careful how you treat me. - Steve, at the new WI building, from the doorman who opens the car door to the board members at the top of the building, they'll all be waiting for me, the widow Weber, with her majority of the shares. Keep smiling, darling. You're still my faithful, trusted attorney. [horns honking] [traffic whizzing] [all chattering] [doors whirring] [glass shattering] [fan whirring] - John, cover the roof. [doors whirring] [horn honking] [sullen music] - Shoot. Must be a rookie. You don't shoot, I'll kill you. [shots firing] [gun clicking] [dramatic music]
