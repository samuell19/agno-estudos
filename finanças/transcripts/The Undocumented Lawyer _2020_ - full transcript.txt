During the initial hearing, Edith was not allowed to provide evidence and to explain in detail her fears for returning to Mexico. Her asylum case was denied. She had a judge who had an over 90 percent denial rate. She has potential avenues for relief, but the wait is long. It could be over four years.

Columbus is supposed to be a sanctuary city, um, and if they can't support a woman who's been living in a sanctuary for a year, then you know, that tells-- that's more, um, a reflection of them than it is of Edith. (BOTH TALKING IN SPANISH) (IN ENGLISH) So, you're suggesting that we go back to Liz Brown and say, "We understand you don't have the votes, -but let's get it on the floor"? -Yeah. We need the support of a local community and we need the support of local... -Absolutely. -...um, the local government. We'll see what happens tomorrow. I'm very honest with my clients. From a legal perspective, there's only so much we can do, but my background is that of an organizer. And so, we know that there's set immigration laws, and then there's policy. And policy changes depending on who's in power. If we're ever going to win anything, not just for Edith, but for many other immigrants, then politicians need to do more than just pay lip service.
