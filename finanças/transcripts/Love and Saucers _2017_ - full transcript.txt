- Well, when I was 17 I lost my virginity to a female extra-terrestrial. That's all I can say about it. - David opens his eyes, only to see a pair of glowing eyes staring back at him. It was a little hairy guy, and David is not afraid. He is very calm. Voice, "David, get dressed, come outside." Cut to David opening the front door. He see's the little hairy being, his eyes glowing, voice, "Follow." David closes the door behind him and follows. They cross the field into a line of trees. There is something on the ground, it is glowing. They go over to it and go inside. There are three insect-like beings. The little hairy being, two of the little men, and a woman. She is wearing a dark blue cloak. One of the insect beings comes towards David. Voice, "Sit." "Remove clothing. "Lie down." David lies down on the bench. There is an orange yellowish light comes on. David is looking at the light. It doesn't hurt his eyes. He is aware of the beings that are standing over him. They are touching his body. David becomes aroused. The woman is there. She looks at David and then eases on top of him. They watch as David and the woman have sex. Soon it is over. The woman looks at him, a slight smile on her face. Woman, "Forget." David says, "Forget." My name is David Huggins, I'm 72 years old, and I live in Hoboken, New Jersey. Mm, yes. I do some writing, I'm writing a script. I have a part, part-time job working at a deli, and then I come home and I paint. Would you like some coffee? I do meditation occasionally, just to calm myself down. Ommm I throw the I Ching. There are dreams I'll have which I just don't understand. And I'll ask the I Ching, what is the meaning of the dream I had last night? Hmm, benefit increase. - What were you asking it? - What do they think of the documentary, the beings. Let's put this over here. Pretty stable environment, nothing out of the ordinary, no. Sometimes I go a few days without eating a thing. And when I do eat, I make a lot. I've always enjoyed impressionistic art. Monet, Renoir, van Gogh. He was an expressionist, though. I mean, the style is very fluid, very loose. Oh, it's just the colors. The colors are just incredible. Well, most of the paintings I do are representative. I did landscapes, still lives, portraits. I'd say they're impressionist, but not really impressionistic. I don't know what you would call them really. I've always liked this scene. This is one of my favorites, Son of Frankenstein. I'm standing before a collection of science fiction horror movies. There's a couple of thousand VHS's here. I just like VHS. There's something about the tape rolling, you know, like a regular film. Let me see, Teenagers from Outer Space. This is from the 50s. Remember when they had all those teenage movies? Oh, The Ghoul. Yes, with Boris Karloff. I mean, you got pimples running up and down your spine. I mean, it's the atmosphere. Sssssss. It's about this scientist who turns people into snakes. The ending is really a stopper. You see the guy, half snake half man. The Uninvited. Oh, this is very good. I think this is the greatest ghost story ever made. - Does the name have any meaning or relation to your encounters too? - No, they were always invited. One movie, it's a Doctor Who movie with William Hartnell, and it's called The Web Planet. It has giant ants, ant-like creatures in it. And when I saw it, I just could not stop watching it. I don't know why, but it seemed familiar to me. The Thing from Another World. A saucer crashes, and they find a body frozen in the ice. It thaws out, and it starts killing people. I saw it when I was about seven or eight years old. I grew up in Paulding County, Georgia. It was all farmland where I lived. There are vast areas that nobody lived in. We had a farm. I had to slop the pigs, cut the grass, carry in wood for the stove. I enjoyed it. My grandparents took me to tent revivals on several occasions. The preacher would come on, hellfire and damnation. There was this woman there, she just started babbling from what I could tell. I think it went on for like 15, 20 minutes, and then it stopped. You know, and it's like, what is this? It turned me off to religion big time. This is a rose bush that I brought up from Georgia many years ago. The blooms don't last very long, but the aroma fills the whole back of the yard. I like going to fields looking for arrowheads. I had quite a nice collection at one time. But that's gone. Basically, my heritage is English, Choctaw, and Cherokee. Where our farm was, it was kind of weird, is that there was a lot of arrowheads there. And I'm thinking at one time it is where they lived. This is my mother and my father. That's my mother, my brother, Marie, and me. This is me, from School Days. This was during the time of my first encounter. My childhood was strange to a certain extent. I was seeing things, and my parents didn't. Nobody in my family seemed to see what I was seeing. My first encounter was when I was eight years old. I was playing at the base of a tree, and I hear this voice say, "David, behind you." And I turned around, and there is this little hairy guy with large glowing eyes coming straight toward me. I thought it was the Bogeyman. I didn't know what to think of it. What was interesting is that for a split second I felt as if I was in his eyes looking at me. Then I just freaked, and I ran to the barn, and I glanced back, and the little hairy guy was turning around and going back into the woods. The eyes were just glowing, is the best way to put it. They just glowed. The next encounter, I went out to the barn to get, I think it was a baseball or something like that. And I heard a noise on the other side of the barn, and I go take a look. And there is this giant insect like being. It resembled like a praying mantis. And I just look at it and started screaming. As I did, he sprayed me with some type of bluish gray liquid. I ran away from the barn, and I notice that this bluish liquid was evaporating very quickly. I was very terrified. It's like, what in the world am I looking at? And for a eight year old, you don't know what to think. There was one time I was going over to a friend's house. And I'm walking behind the barn, I'm going through a field. And I get the impression I am being watched, but I didn't anything. And then I hear a sound like the mooing of a cow. And I see a head coming up from behind the bush. And I'm looking at it, and I'm saying, "Is that a head? "Are those eyes?" I start getting scared, and then suddenly, I said to myself, "Why is it so bright?" And I just fainted or just fell down, and curled up into a ball. And there were several little grays standing around me. But the next thing I know is that I hear three beeps, and I'm standing chest deep in these weeds, and I don't know how I got there. I was in the back field. I was looking for arrowheads. I happened to glance up, and I see about eight or nine little blue guys drop from the sky, and they hit the ground running straight toward me. I took off toward the house. I went around the front of the house. I looked underneath our house because it was on pillars, and I could see their legs on the other side. And then they just turned and walked away. That night, I'm looking out the window, and who should I see but several of the little guys. Then I see them come in into my room, and they take me outside. And we floated up to some type of craft. I'm inside a room, a well lit room with one of the little grays, and a woman comes in. She has a long rod in her hand. She tilts my head back. The little gray guy holds me. And she thrusts the rod up my nose. She inserted something inside my nose. And after she pulled it out, I said, "You hurt me, you hurt me." And she says, "Let me see." And she looked at me, and she made the pain go away. You know how we tag whales and stuff like that? I think there were multiple crafts. But I only say them one at a time. But they were round, oval shaped, very bright. Sometimes they were dark. When they were around there is just and incredibly beautiful silence. I mean, it was like I was inside a vacuum or something. There could be a car outside honking its horn, and then it would stop. And there would be nothing, absolutely nothing. These beings didn't seem hostile at all. Scared the hell out of me, but no, there was never any hostility at all. There's the little grays. They were small. I kinda of got the impression they were workers. The hairy guy, it was his eyes that always got me. A tall thin being, he had a knob on the back of his head. He was like the person in charge. There was the insect being. He reminded me of a praying mantis. He was frightening, but he always spoke to me as if i was a child. And then there was Crescent. I was walking in the woods, and I see a woman sitting under a tree. And she gets up, and she starts coming toward me. I become very aroused sexually. I couldn't get my pants down fast enough. I fall back on the ground, and I'm lying there, and she's looking at me, and I reached my climax, which was quite painful actually. It was very intense. And then I'm looking into her eyes and I pass out. And the next thing I know, I wake up. I don't know how much later, maybe 15 or 20 minutes. My pants are down around my knees. I couldn't understand what they were doing down there. And so, I quickly got up, pulled my pants and underwear up, and I was gone, I left. Virginity lost. I figured if anything, I'll be losing it in the backseat of a Ford, something like that. But no, no, it didn't work out that way at all. I couldn't take Georgia anymore. There was just nothing there. Well, I always enjoyed drawing and painting. My parents didn't like it. I heard about the Art Students League. So, I wrote a letter to my folks, told them where I was going, and that was it. I just got up and I left. I was 19 years old. They weren't there when I left, or they would've stopped me. This is during the great transit strike of 1965, '66, somewhere around there. And there was no buses running or anything like that. I said, "Oh my god," 'cause this is gonna be one very wet walk. And so, anyway, I started walking. And then when I got to 5th Avenue, I held out my thumb. I figured, well, hell, I might as well try it. And this big black car pulls up, stops. And this woman, she says, "Where are you going?" I says, "Ma'am, if you can just take me "across Central Park, I can walk the rest of the way home." So, she said, "Get in." We didn't talk very much. We get there, and I said, "Thank you very much for the ride. "You saved me a wet walk." She just nodded her head. That night I had a very strange dream. I see this face, it's a woman's face. But the eyes are closed, and she's coming toward me. And I don't remember anything else after that. It was dreamlike, I should say, but it wasn't a dream. And every time I would wake up in the morning, I would hear these words. "We'll be back tonight." Now, this is going on for months. You have no idea what I was going through. "It was only a dream. "No it wasn't, she's real. "No, she's not." I'm going back and forth. I just did not know what to think. One morning when I wake up, I hear those words. "We'll be back tonight." But I didn't forget them. I go to the league, and I end the classes. And as I'm walking home, I'm still having, "Yes, no, yes, maybe, I don't know." I pass a florist, and I see these flowers inside the window. They were pink cyclamens. And I say, "Well, if she's real, "then the flowers are hers." I remember lying in bed, and I say, "Those are for you." The next morning, I wake up. Wham, it hit me. She took the flowers. I couldn't believe it. That night, I knew they were gonna come back. I cleaned up the house, washed some dishes. Had to be spick and span. It was like I was gonna have a date. We weren't going to be going out, but as a date. That night, we were rubbing our heads together. Next time you're with your girlfriend, start rubbing heads. Trust me on this. There was something very beautiful, something very lovely about her. She had a very nice body. The only thing that was different about her was that she had very long fingernails, and she had these very large eyes, and her face was rather pale. My relationship with Crescent was warm and friendly, a little strange. What do I mean little, very strange. She was my girlfriend, really. This was one of the first paintings I ever did. It's not really all that good. She's on top of me, I reach my climax, and she and the insect being leave. I was always having sex with her. I was on the bottom, and she was on top. Because I was basically kinda paralyzed. A very unconventional relationship. There were a couple of women at the Art Students League. I would have only one date, and that was it. They would find some reason not to go out with me again. But at that time, it was basically Crescent. I was doing some painting, and then all at once, the wall opens up, and there is Crescent, and she's very stressed out. And she says, "David, the baby's dying." And I go, "Baby? What baby?" "Your baby, but it's dying." And I said, "Show me my baby." At first she wouldn't do it, and I had to yell it out three times really loud. "Show me my baby." She picks the baby up out of some container and holds it out in front of her. And the baby's just like dangling. And I said, "No, no, no, don't hold the baby like that. "Cradle the baby in your arms. "Listen, I've gotta come there." "No, you're not allowed." "My baby's dying, and I can't come there? "What's this?" And I go and I pass out on my bed. The next thing I know, I'm there. The insect being comes over, and he's rather upset with me. He says, "What are you doing here?" I said, "My baby's dying. "I want my baby." And I see Crescent holding the baby, but the baby is not moving. And I reach over to touch it, and just as I touch it, like static electricity jumped from my hand to the baby, and the baby moved. Maybe I was imparting some of my energy to it. And I say, "Wow, did you see that? "The baby's moving." The insect being is looking at me, and he says, "Come with me." And we go into another room filled with babies. And I'm looking at them, and I say, "Oh my god. "Whose babies are these?" He points to me. I wasn't so much as creeped out as I was surprised. I was just like, whoa, no, no. I could not believe it at first. But they were my babies, and I had to help them, so I wound up touching them all. There was one time where I had totally flipped. I was taking off my clothes, and I'm hearing these words, "Everything is fine, everything is all right." And I wasn't all right. I started crying and everything. I just broke down. I kept saying, "The baby died, the baby died. "Oh my god, it's my fault, it's my fault." "Everything is fine, everything is all right. "Everything is fine, everything is all right." And it wasn't fine, and it wasn't all right. "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no." I was carrying on, I was spreading my arms, crying. These two very large women grab a hold of me, and they forced me to the floor. Crescent came running in, and says, "David, what is the matter?" And I said, "My baby died." And I didn't calm down until Crescent said, "David, the baby didn't die. "See, here's your baby." And one of the women comes in holding the baby. I get up and I go over to it. And all the guilt or whatever I felt was gone. This is the morning I woke up. I heard this voice inside my head. "The baby is fine, the baby is all right." It was like letting me know for sure. there was like this amnesia, or whatever it is, but every time I'd have an experience with these beings, whether I saw them during the day or at night, I always forget it. It was just incredible. I should not forget something like that, but I did. It started coming back August 17, 1987. They had left me alone for a long period of time. I got married, and we had Michael. It seemed like I was living a perfectly normal life until I started remembering things. And then it just like, flipped me out. I was creeping around the house, because I felt that there was somebody else in the house. I felt a presence... but I never saw them. I didn't know what to think. I was just beside myself. I was getting nervous, anxious, paranoid really. I was basically a walking bowl of jello. I didn't know who to speak to or anything like that. I heard about Budd Hopkins. And I tried getting his book. It was like a compulsion. It was like I was being led to the book. I'm going back to the house, and looking through the book, and there was this chapter, Other Women Other Men, and I start reading it. I go, "Oh my god." This is the woman I never told anyone about. As I was reading it, memory upon memory come flooding back. It was just like image upon image, upon image. It wouldn't stop. I think what bothered me the most is I didn't know what to do with it. I was so scared. There was this meeting with these beings, and the tall thing guys aid, "Let David do paintings." It took me about three weeks to get up enough nerve to do my first painting. But I did. And that night I got such a restful sleep. It was just a relief to get the images down on the canvas. That's the insect being. He is always there. This is my other body. This is the packaged alien. It opened it's eyes and mouth, and it began tapping on the side of the plastic. I quickly gave it back to him. It kind of scared me. It's a UFO over my head, and it is humongous. I am someplace, it is park-like, it is beautiful. This is on the other side of the portal, then it closes up, and I am someplace else. We're in space, or at least it seemed to me we were in space. We went to this room, there was this bowl on this table, and I was supposed to ejaculate into the bowl. - Not very romantic. - No. This is one of the large women, and I had sex with this woman. It was quite pleasant, even though she was bigger than me, and stronger. I was traumatized. I'm not saying that I wasn't. But after I started doing the paintings, it seemed like I was calming down, and that I realized that these things had happened to me. And I was able to face it. Oops, out of staples. Okay. I see the image in my head, and I start drawing the image image or painting the image. There was like, I don't know, something orangey about his eyes. He was just standing there looking at me. And I went and told my father, and he came back very angry with me. "There's nobody out there! "Boy, quit making things up." Yeah, yeah, yeah. The next day I was behind our house, and there was Crescent. I said, "My mama and daddy don't believe me "when I say I see you. "I got a whipping." And as soon as I said it, I knew she didn't like hearing that. Then she just stared right into my eyes, and she says, "Then don't tell them." After that, I never said a word. - This is what you were painting last time I was here. - Yeah, I just never did finish it. - As you're painting, does the memory become clearer? - Yes, it does, actually. I usually see 'em rather bright, you know. But this was dark. I think it's a UFO. It wasn't a hole in space, I can tell you that much, 'cause it was moving. Let me see here, okay. My mother and father drank a great deal. If I was anywhere around, I usually got hit or something like that. And I just got sick and tired of it. Sometimes it was with a belt. Sometimes it was with a switch, rather thick. And dad was seeing other women. It was like hell, really. And I hear this voice inside my head saying, "If you don't leave now, you never will." And well, I left. I'm not strict with Michael at all. I've never hit him, spare the rod and all that good stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is one time I did one painting which I totally made up. I destroyed it. The main reason why I did it is that they were very upset with me. And it was like, "David, do the paintings, "But don't make anything up." Now, when this painting dries, I'm thinking of putting some trees down here at the bottom. But I've got to wait until it dries. - What would you title this painting? - Something in the Sky? I'm working on a movie script about my ET experiences. Right now, I'm up to a point where David sees his babies in the incubator room, and he is shocked. And he asks the insect being, "Whose babies are these?" And the insect being points to him. And David says to himself, "How am I going to send these kids to college." The act of writing is, for me, similar to painting. It seems like I get more out of it by writing it by hand. I just seem to remember a little bit more. I just remembered something. There was a time during my teens where I seemed to float off my bead. And then as I'm floating off the bed, I kinda wake up, and then I crash back down on the bed again. - What made you just remember that? - It's what I'm reading here. I read the book, and then several months later we got a divorce. We had been having problems in our marriage. I know that she knows that something was different about me. I didn't know how to bring it up. I said, "We gotta sit down. "I gotta talk to you about something. "I have no idea where to start." But I said, "I have had a experiences as a child "with all I can say are aliens, "and there were sexual encounters also." And that was when it stopped. "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "I don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna hear it. "I don't wanna hear it, you're crazy." That was it. Oh, which one am I looking for? Yeah, this is a young boy that she showed me that was mine and hers. It's like, in a way, I think of Michael. It's like he has some half brothers and half sisters someplace. Well, I told Michael when he was younger, you know. But I kept it very light. And I said, "These are people that I know. "They're from someplace else." And he would say, "Well, where?" I said, "I don't know." This is me holding my son upside down. He likes to be held that way, I have no idea why. I've gotta ask him one of these days if he remembers. - I don't really remember how I found out. I just remember the paintings. I just asked, "Who are they? "What are they?" I guess, at some point, I was told. But there was never a moment where we had a big conversation about it. I guess my childhood upbringing was pretty easy going, pretty normal. Well, the extra terrestrial encounters are unique. The encounters never impacted my childhood. It was just something that was going on. And it never flowed over into my life. Yeah, I supposed I just accepted it. I never really questioned it or was very concerned about it. - I admire him that he believes in certain things. And nobody has to judge nobody else. I know David by one day walking in the store looking for the job. And he told me he knew how to work in a deli. And I gave him a chance, and since then he's still working here. - Yes, sir, may I help you? - He's a very quiet person. He gets along with everybody. - Just made it a little while ago. Enjoy. - Thanks. - I saw his paintings once. Well, each one believes in his own ideas. And I respected that. - Do you believe that David had these experiences? - Yes, I do. That's what he tells me, and I just believe it. - My name's Nitten. I live on the block. And it's a block where everyone has a good time just hanging on the steps, talk. And our friend, David, is a very good neighbor since the last 30 years that I know. And very quiet. And when you see him, the most friendliest guy you'll ever meet is David. And he's actually the last man standing alone on this block. We had a lot of people who have gone to heaven, and he's the only guys who's left here on the block. No, I haven't heard his unique story. I would like to hear his unique story. Oh, beautiful eyes on the alien. Hypnotic eyes. So, that's his room, and she's having sexual intercourse. Wow. That's something unique, from an alien? - I have not had sex with aliens or anybody like that. But the question, would I in the first place? I've written thousands front page articles in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. I have interviewed Hillary Clinton many years ago when she was a senator. I've interviewed Michael Bloomberg, and the mayors of New York, and other public figures. I connect with people. I connect in a very human way, because there's a human story behind that person. I do the same thing when I'm dealing with somebody who claims to have had an experience. I am involved in the UFO subject very intimately, both as experiencer and as one who founded a support group for people who have had experiences of seeing UFOs, to having close contact with UFOs. And the group is called SPACE. The letters mean Search Project for Aspects of Close Encounters. People come to our meeting and tell about their experiences. And David was one of them. He showed us some of his artwork. And that's how we actually formed a friendship. What David reveals, the way he talks, the way he does his art, from all that he's told me, from all that he's shown me, from his manner and personality and character, I trust what he says. And it conveys not only trust, but commonalities that other people who also have the ability to sketch and make artwork which I collected over the years. This is my own sketch of an experience in 1993 in Greenwich Village. I have fun. This is my balloon alien blown up. I put him on the bed, and he's reading UFO Roswell. What does he think? Now, why did they choose David Huggins, for that matter, anybody else? And David has pondered that for a long time. And I don't think he has an answer. - $64 question, I have no idea why. I mean, I don't consider myself all that important or special. I mean, I don't even know what that means anymore. But they came into my life, and to a certain degree, they're still there. Who are these beings? What do these experiences mean? And why did these beings choose me? I don't know, I've never asked these questions. Okay. Who are these beings? Creative power, the Creator. What do these experiences mean? What do these experiences mean? Eight. 39. Hm, obstacles. What do these experiences mean? Obstacles. Why did these beings choose me? Okay, let me see what that one is. Advancement. It must be Doug. - Just ring the bell? Yes, I'll be down in a minute. - The original Thing, I love. - Yes. - With James Arness. - I have a few of those. - Yeah. That was always a very, very effective film. - How do you know David? - I'd heard about you at first. And then when I met David, I went into where you were working at Lisa's. - Right. - And I introduced myself. I don't have these kinds of experiences at all, but I'm very, very, good for some reason at spotting things. One of the reasons why I think I'm good at it is I actually look up. When everybody else is walking around in this town with their head down. The closest thing that I've had when I was seeing something was a sort of a very spiritual feeling. It was a cooler day, and it was brilliant blue out. And I was ready to see something. And I sat on my church steps on 7th and Jefferson, the St. Ann's Church. I sat there, camera here, just watching, and watching, and waiting. And one of the most beautiful sights, a whitish pearlescent orb came over my head, stopped directly above me, I took about 20 pictures of it. It was beautiful, a diffused pearlescent orb. And the second I looked down to do something on my camera, it was gone. I'm working on an interesting series of paintings about whistleblowers. I'm up to almost 60 portraits of whistleblowers. The town councilor in Whitby, England, that means he held a political position and was elected after he came out admitting that his parents were mantid beings. So, can you imagine that? He comes out in public and admits that his real mother is like a mantid being. And David paints the mantids, which is interesting. And he admitted that, and they still re-elected him as town councilor. - Okay, you ready? - Yeah, who is this guy? - That's Bigfoot. - And what's his significance? - He guards our door and holds our hats. Some of the best and most popular science fiction writers of all time had jaw dropping paranormal experiences. And that's why they wrote the stories they wrote. It's the paranormal that produces the science fiction, and then the science fiction loops back and influences the paranormal. It's not just that David remembers abduction experiences because he has a thousand VHS tapes of science fiction movies. It's that he actually collected a thousand VHS tapes because he had an abduction experience. It goes both ways I think. When I spoke to David, I heard a man who is very sincere, very simple in many ways, whom I really liked immediately. I mean, he just exudes this kind of humane personable nature. And I heard a man who was just telling us the truth as best he could without a whole lot of interpretive overlay. Kind of a humility there. He's clearly working through his experiences, and his suffering, and his joy all at the same time. I'm a professor of religion at Rice University. I am a historian of religions, which means I compare religious experiences, kind of across space and time. The first half of my career, I wrote about erotic forms of mysticism. People's extreme religious experiences that were also sexual in some way. It's extremely common actually in the history of religions. And that's really what brought me to the theme of the alien abduction literature. So, really, the alien abduction literature, in my own mind, is simply a modern secular form of mystical literature. I mean, the whole history of religions is essentially about weird beings coming from the sky and doing strange things to human beings. And historically, those events or encounters had been framed as angels, or demons, or Gods, or Goddesses, or what have you. But in the modern sort of secular world we live in, they get framed in sort of science fiction. Most people, when they think of the sacred, who are not trained in the field, think of the holy as the good. So, being holy is about being nice. But actually, when a human being encounters the sacred, it's a terrifying experience, and it's an ecstatic experience. You are being split open. So, I'm not surprised at all to see someone like David say it was scary and then to paint some of these terrifying images, and to insist that it was the most pleasurable events of his life. And he'd do it again in a heartbeat. I myself actually had such an experience in Calcutta in 1989. It was extremely dramatic, it was extremely erotic, and it was scary. It was that single event that, I think, makes me so sympathetic to people who've had these experiences, because I know they happen. You can't tell me they don't happen. It happened to me, and I know it happens. I absolutely think David's being genuine. You certainly can't talk to him without thinking that. He's a very humble man. But I also believe him because his story is so similar to other stories I've heard from other people I've worked with, and got to know very, very, well. I'm completely convinced they're not lying. They're being very sincere. But again, what it is is an entirely different question. And that's where I think we need a lot more humility. - Believing is like a funny thing. It's like, unless we really experience something, we may often say we believe, but we really don't. I look at the character of a person, then I look at "what is the motive?" I mean, there's no motive. This is one of the things I thought about. David has no motive to be telling anything other than what's real for him. It's not like he's raking in millions of dollars. There doesn't seem to be any kind of motive. - I would think that initially, if they're not familiar with the subject, they say, "This is fantasy, this is fiction. "This is made up to sell paintings," and all that. And others say, "You must be kidding me. "There's something wrong with you," or, "See a psychiatrist, or something." Some say maybe, maybe, the maybe is very important, maybe it can be. - There is always a possibility that there are other explanations. But I think the fact that there are a lot of people in the world that have had so many similar encounters in so many different ways, so many different parts of the world without any form of communication, that I think this is probably the best explanation. - Do you believe in extraterrestrials? - Yes. I always believed there was alien life out there. We cannot be the only ones in the universe alone. - I never seen any astronauts. I never seen any. But I do believe that they exist. And I believe certain people can see them. - I don't ask anyone to believe a word I say in regard to whatever this is. That's the sketch when I thought the baby had died. I was doubting myself, but I knew that the experiences were real, because I've seen them when I'm awake. I mean, the little hairy guy, the insect being, the guys floating down from out of the sky. Those were not dreams. You wanna say they're interplanetary, fine. They're intergalactic, fine. Another universe, fine. Another dimension, I don't know. I just don't know. You know, it doesn't really matter to me. I know they exist, I know they're real, and that's enough for me. I mean, if they ever tell me where they're from, I'll let you know. I miss her, but she's where she is, and I am where I am. I don't know what else to say. - Would you have left the Earth forever to stay the rest of your life with her? - I think so, yes. I mean, if they had said yes, I would've gone with them, and I would've stayed. But it didn't work out that way. No, I don't think I would've missed it at all. I would not have missed Earth at all. The Earth is getting warmer, and warmer, and warmer, floods, tornadoes, fires, plus the war on terrorism. No, I wouldn't miss this. I wouldn't miss it at all. - Maybe in the center of eye level. And then I'll sort of build out, so I just put a little cluster around it. - Yeah. - I'll suppose I'll get it so it doesn't look so cluttered. If I have it side by side like that, that's gonna look a little too... - I think there it is. Okay. - So, David, what are you feeling now? - I feel fine. I mean, I'm not nervous or anything like that. - Are you excited? - Yeah. The paintings are gonna be the impression. Whatever they think is what they think. - When showing publicly like this, what do you hope people take away? - That there is another reality, and that, well that's basically someone else. When I was seventeen. - Why are you chuckling? - Oh, it's just the expression on my face. Yeah, it's a nice space. - The atmosphere is really incredible. Like you just kinda feel like you're in this room. - I really like it. I like that it's kinda open. It adds something to it, and I really love the colors. I just find it really soothing to look at it. - This might not be so bad. - Right. - Yeah, I had an experience. I don't remember it in as much detail as you, but I do remember being taken aboard a ship, and then also given a little child to hold, a little hybrid child. I don't have this level of detail. When you look at these, it could stimulate a memory. - And is that like an alien bug, or what is the... - That's the praying mantis type being. - Okay. - He's not a bug. - I'm not even sure, I think he looks more like this or that. - Okay. - And there is this door, an opening, and was filled with all this light. And then I had to come out. And the next morning I woke up. Man I was so energetic, and I am so energized you would not believe. Somebody pushes my head forward, and I start nursing on the breast again. Teaching them how to nurse. - Yeah. - Anyway, I... - You're teaching the babies how to nurse. - Yes. And I turned around, and he is coming right out of the woods straight toward me. Beep, beep, beep. It was instantaneous, it was like clockwork. - Did they always take you, or did they sometimes come visit? - Oh, they come and visit. - Oh, they do? - Yeah, this takes place in my bedroom. - Oh, okay. - Does this still reoccur? - Yes. - Continues to reoccur? That's fascinating. - When did you sort of decide to start? - I was with the beings one day, and they said, "Let David do paintings" So, I started doing the paintings. It was a catharsis. I mean, alright I've done one painting. Let me do another one, another, and another, and another, and another. I've got about a hundred paintings. And that was it, that was it. - That one. - That one that has a kind of urn head. - What was that like? - Oh, I enjoyed it very much. I'm so glad that people enjoyed my work. They found it informative, off the wall. Full moon is out tonight. - Do you have any last thoughts on the night or parting words? - No, except I had a very good time, and I enjoyed myself immensely. It was nice watching people's faces as they were looking at the paintings. All right, I'm gonna get out. You got everything that you need? - Yeah, thanks. - Uh-huh, you too. - We have come to visit you in peace and with good will. - I think what I like about this movie is that it's the people that are the savages, and he's the one that's civilized.
