How much do you need? Wha-- I am offended. -How much? -Fifty bucks. What happened? Ms. Greenhut found someone to do her roof for less money. Do you ever think about workin' for a company? Why? I have all I need. House, truck, food, beer. Beer that I buy. I got some other stuff comin' up. I'll pay you back. I don't want you to pay me back. I want you to take care of yourself. I do. Financially, idiot. How's things with you, sis? You know Davie was asking about you. Davie, huh? He made his choice. Arlene? -Don't say it. -Well, it's true. He saw something in her. Yeah, that's what it is. Well, she can have him. Besides, now I only have one drunk to buy booze for. I am not a drunk. I'm an explorer. Booze intensifies the exploration. Mm-hmm. You know what you should do. -What? -You should find the richest guy you know, and marry him. Mm-hmm-hmm. What would that get me? A life of not working. And all the time you want for your stupid books. You're such a deep thinker. Oh. Woo! -Believe it or not, sis... -Mm-hmm. I do love you. I know you do, Darrell. Thank you! Goin' to Lula's tonight, you interested? No. And I want a man, just not that dirtbag. I am a man. Yes, you are, but you are like family. Uh, I thought you said Jenny was staying home. I thought she was. Hey, sis, let me buy you a drink. With my money? Don't say that, I'm trying to impress Sunny. Is it working? No. How are you doin'? I'm fine. The house felt empty. -Aw. -Here. Darrell, what is this? Dragon's breath. Can I get a beer, please? Of course. Oh, well look who just walked in. What's goin' on, Davie? Just gonna talk to my wife. Is that really a great idea? Darrell, hey. I can handle this. Yeah. Hi. What are you doin' here? I just wanted to get out of the house. -Where's Arlene? -What do you care? -Okay. I'm gonna go down-- -Hey, hey. Hey. Please. Please. Come here. Come on. When can I come home? I missed you. I-- I miss you. Davie. It's over. You know we are no good together. - No. - Yes. No, why do you get to decide, okay? I'm your husband.. - What? - Time to take a walk. Get off me, Darrell. I want to talk to my wife. Move along! It's over, Davie. Go home and sleep it off. It's so-- What's that for? My sister. Stay away from her. Stay away from where she goes. Stay away from the diner. If you don't want a beating every time you go out, just stay at home, 'kay? Last time, Davie. No more maybes. Hit like a girl. Hey, did you guys hear? There's a movie comin' to town. Subtle transition. What? I'm excited about it. -Mmm. -You know what she meant. You know, sis, I never got to tell you that I'm sorry. For what? You had to give up. You know, your... Your dreams. Aw. Thank you, Darrell. Your secret's safe with me. What secret? That you have a heart, moron. Oops. What movie, huh? The North Carolina government doesn't want us having movies anymore. I don't know, but they're supposed to be here in about three months. Mmm. What kind? I think it's one of those, like, hometown feel-good love movies. Wouldn't it be funny if it was a John Raymond film? That's-- You okay, Jenny? Jenny. -Yeah? Sorry. -You okay? - Hey. - Hey. Hey, did you hear about this movie? Yeah, the-- Sunny was telling me about that last night. So exciting. I mean, nothing ever happens around here, and now this? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I suppose. Well, I'll tell you one thing. If they're lookin' for local talent to do a love scene with their leading man, I'm their girl. Bar! Hey, would you mind takin' that out to the counter for me? - Yeah, no problem. - Thanks. -Make another burger. -Why? Just do it. Mother pus-bucket. Shelly told me the sliders were good. Uh, $6.50 plus tax. Unless you want rings. I'm sorry? The sliders. They're $6.50. Comes with fries. May I have some? Why are you here? I'm hungry. No. Why are you in town? -Really? -The movie? It's what I do now. I knew it. Then why are you so surprised? I'll get you sliders. - Hey, you okay? - You know who that is? - I do. - God. That's my ex-boyfriend! I know. What happened? Oh. Quick on the trigger. No. Wait-- What-- I don't remember. He left me. So, he cheated on you? No. He left me to go to Hollywood. Oh. You still love him. Yup. What? No. No. -I told him to go. -What? I told him that he needed to go after what he wanted and, well, there he went. And now you're angry. I don't know. But this-- this isn't fair. He should have told me that he was coming here. Oh, yeah, 'cause that makes perfect sense. Oh, shut up. See, this is why he left you, 'cause you're a mean girl. I'm sorry. I really wasn't expecting this. It's okay. Did he ask you out? I just got separated. I do not want a man right now. Am I being this childish? No. You are being the perfect adult woman. What should I do, then? Maybe you should take this to him without dropping it. Oh, go to Hell, Gus. I'm already here, Aunt Jenny. -You did this. -Mm-hmm. He hasn't gone. I got this. Here you go. Service with a smile. -How are you? -Confused. Why would someone who hasn't been to this town in ten years choose Wilmington to make a movie? Fulfilling a promise. Not to me. No. My mother. She always wanted me to make a film in this place. I'm sorry about your mom. Thanks. Me too. So, how's Davie? Come on. You already know. Yeah. I'm sorry about that, too. Yeah. He's hittin' the bottle kinda hard, too. Has been the past few years. Yeah, I know what that's like. Yeah, heard you gave it up, huh? How's that goin' for ya? Cheeky. It's been four years now. -Notice a difference? -Yeah. My writing's softer. Never got back into the theatre, huh? No. It's too much work. I ain't never seen a town this small. Good Lord. Stephen James Burley, Jenny Hill. Devlin. - Is it still Devlin? - Nice to meet you. Call me Bear. Want somethin' to eat, Bear? No. I want somethin' to drink. Where can I get somethin' like that? -You like our music? -Aw, are you kiddin' me? Well, they have live music at Tail's Piano Bar tonight. I love it! Uh, what time do you get off work? I'm buying. Ooh. I have some stuff to take care of at home. Yeah, and we have to get goin'. What about your food? We have a thing at the government, uh, building. Oh, yeah, that thing. How can I possibly forget that? You really shook him. Congratulations. Aw, well, I'm comin'. We gotta go to that thing that's so important that I couldn't possibly make up an excuse in front of her. Shall we go? Tail's, right? Come by. I'll, uh, tell you all about that thing. Comin', boss. Hey, Mrs. Harling. Hey, Jenny. Do you have any of those blueberry puffs? Of course I do, honey. I always know when you're comin' in. There you go. -Oh, no. -Please, Mrs. Harling. Take the money. You gotta make a living, too. I feel bad. Davie is not your problem. Oh, no, it-- it-- but I had to cancel my siding job. I-- had to go out of town, and I didn't-- didn't feel good about leavin' Darrell all by himself at my house. Oh, I understand. Uh, Darrell's been known to be irresponsible. Oh. As soon as I get back from Florida, I promise. His work is wonderful. It's just all that drinkin'. He hasn't been drinkin' on the job, has he? Not that I know of, no. -He has. -Jenny. Don't you ever miss dancin'? I was just a kid, Mrs. Harling. You were like one of them beautiful dancers I seen in the movies, but live. That might be one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me. Comes from the heart, m'dear, comes from the heart. -Thanks. Take care. -You, too. He knew you were in the coffee shop. Sunny! You scared the hell out of me. What'd you just say? He knew you were in the coffee shop. -Really? -Look. That Bear guy is buying drinks tonight, and I can't make it, so I'm gonna need you to drink for me. Bear's buying everybody drinks? He found out how much booze cost here, and it was almost a spiritual thing. Well, I'm not really interested in guys right now. Um, John's not going and Bear is gay. I think you're fine. -Bear's gay? -Yeah. So? Well, how do you know that he's gay? I asked, and it's not like looking for an Easter egg. Really? Well. And you're the musical theater girl. Hm. Hm. How did you meet Bear? I grew up here, too. And I talked to John, and maybe you should say hi to him, too. I think you should give him a chance. I think of John no differently than any of my other friends. Hm. Yeah. Is that why you're over here hiding? Wanna come join us? We're just looking for places we might want to shoot. No, thanks. I think I'd just get in the way. He knows you're over here. What am I doing? I mean, he's just a guy, right? -That you dated. -That became very successful. So what? He's successful, I'm working in a diner. Owning a diner. Look, you're welcome to come over and join us. Yeah, I don't know. All right. Just make sure you show up at the bar tonight. He won't be there. Stop! God, it just sucks. Okay, we don't have to get this number right. That was a bit harsh. Are you kidding me? I did a show for her years ago. She was way worse on me. I was fighting with your booze. Kids, sit. Cast, I want you to meet-- Sit. I want you to meet John Raymond, director, writer, turncoat. Ouch! What's that about? Why'd you say that? Well, when was the last time you were on stage? Uh, I think I'm a little too old for that now. How are you, Kat? You are absolutely the only one allowed to get away with that. Say hello. Hi, kids. Uh. If it was easy, everybody would do it. Say hi to my assistant, Bear Burley. -Hey, Katherine. -Hey. Doesn't suit your accent. Brooklyn. Pretty good. Yeah, she used to dance in the city. -Quite a few years. -Don't tell him that! He'll think I'm old. How are you, Bear? Hey, ever get mad at your mom for callin' you that? Hey. I like it better than Barney. Yikes. - Oughta disown her. - I didn't have to. She named me Stephen. Oh! I-- Uh, uh, this place is great. The town or the theater? Both. I miss the theater. Really? And you're his assistant? Hey! Take it easy on me. You know I support this place. Oh, yeah, of course. So what are you guys, uh, performing? -What are you workin' on? -The cabaret fundraiser. Most of our budget. Hint, hint. I know. I brought my checkbook. Woo-hoo! Okay, so, uh-- I know you guys didn't come over for chitchat. Well, we're shooting a scene and it takes place in a theater. Mm-hmm. Oh. Okay, well, I'll handle Tony. Am I in the movie? All right, slow down. Yeah, I mean there's still contracts to be signed, and we have to figure out the costs, and uh, all the stuff that goes with it-- Well, fine. Am I in the movie? -I'll take a look and see-- -Yes, we will find a place for you. Woo-hoo! Done deal. You find me a spot, theater's yours. All right. When's their performance? Three weeks. Coming? We'll bring the production team. Yeah. Hey. I didn't get the lead I wanted. Who's playin' it? I am. Who did you want? All right, back to rehearsal. I love her. Yeah, she's a hoot. Hey, what was that leading role thing about? That's not important. What's next on the schedule? We're done! -Hm. -You coming out with us? No. I've got things to do. What's the problem? I don't get out much. I need to look good. Why? Sunny said he's not gonna be there. Or are you looking at someone else? I am looking at no one. You know I've been down this road before? Remember? I drove you to your prom. I have more important things in my life to think about than the opinion of John Jessup Raymond. If he's there-- He's not going to be there. You really believe that? Sunny would never lie. Well, anyway, how about this one? That's the one. -Yeah? -I'm sure of it. All right. Shoes. -Oh, God, shoes. -They always forget the shoes. So, my husband is late getting off stage. The drop came in, bonked him on the head. And all you can hear is him during a blackout say, "My bad!" Oh, God. That is when I fell in love with that knucklehead. God, I miss him. How long ago was that? - Five years? - Mm. Yeah. He loved the theater. He brought your boss down in to do a show in Lumberton. -You're kidding! What show? -Mm-mmm. Camelot. John was great on stage, and Jenny should have been Guinevere. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, say what? Jenny. I didn't know you was a theater girl. I was a theater girl. -Yes, and good, too. -Oh, stop it, we're-- If I could, I would be on stage right now. Hey? So Bear, you're queer. Oh, Darrell. Why, yes, Darrell. Yes, I am. Uh, you? What? I was just trying to break things up. Did I say something wrong? You have no idea. Well, I didn't mean to offend you. It's cool, big dude, it's cool. I heard a lot worse. I guess you're my first, uh... -Gay. -Yeah. No, it's not. What does that mean? Shh! It's a secret. Okay, everyone, singin' starts in a half hour! Start gettin' your songs in! Oh, hell. That's gonna happen. What you singin', Jenny-Lou? You'd have to get her way more drunk. That's right. I couldn't. That was long ago. Ah. Okay. You're not going to sing, I'm going to Lula's. Ooh. Mm-hmm. Bye! I'll see you later, Darrell. Woo-hoo! Hey, guys! -What's up? -Shut up, Henry. No, John, you have to learn to control the women. Are you kidding me? You know women? I bet you don't even know girls. Um, have you met my parents? Yeah, they hate each other. No, John. They understand each other. Let's go. Hey, guys! Shut up, Henry! If no one sings tonight, I'm just gonna keep playing theater stuff. Hey, Henry, um, can you give me a beer? One. And if you get out of hand, again, I'm callin' the cops. Hey. I'm the public. You can't talk to me like that. Get out. Now! Who is that guy? Oh. That's Jenny's ex. Mm. Sorry to hear that. Hey, Davie. Calling it a night? I heard you're back in town. People here don't want you around anymore. Maybe I can change all that. Who knows? Maybe not. Katie. How are you? John Raymond. As ever, so handsome. Are you drunk? Of course. John Raymond. -Henry. -How's it goin', man? It's goin'. How are you? -Oh, I'm good. -Yeah. This place is fantastic. I think your sister's drunk. Yeah. Yeah, she's always drunk. -What can I get you? -Uh. Tea, if you have it. Oh. You're serious. I quit drinking. I can just take a water, if it's all the same. Uh-- uh, no. What-- what kind of tea do you want? Earl Grey? I swear, I didn't know he'd be here. I believe it. He's always predictable, except when it comes to bars. Thanks, Henry. Evening, everyone. Folks doin' okay? Yeah. Um. Just didn't expect to see you here. I got a little bored at the hotel. So, Jenny, are you singing? I know Bear would love to hear it. And I would, too. Good call. You just made us all feel a little bit more uncomfortable while we wait for her response. It's fine. Uh, did you find everything you needed for the shoot downtown? Oh, yeah, sure. Sure, sure, it's coming along. We still have a long way to go, but... Mm-hmm. Uh, when do you start shooting, John? Oh, we start shooting, uh, about two weeks. Who's casting it? Sandy Chastain. Hm. Knew it. She's married with two kids. And why the hell does that matter? It doesn't matter. What the hell's going on? Have you seen Sandy Chastain? Yeah, we work with her a lot. Let's just say that Jenny is not a fan. - Okay. - I made a mistake. Excuse me. What? Sandy Chastain. Why did you say that? What did I say? You know he never had anything with that woman. I know. God. Damn it, all right. John! Wait. I'm sorry. That wasn't fair. Why are you here? Why not Charlotte or Raleigh? Why here? I don't know. That's not true, I do know. You know how you said I never had any dreams? I never said that. Yes, you did. You know, after all these years you're gonna have to stop competing with me. -I'm sorry? -You were right. Well, there's a first. You know, you can stop that too. You know, never mind. Okay, John! I'll listen. When you said that, I started thinking. Okay? What if there was something I could do? You know what was amazing? You were right. I just wanted to do it together. I didn't think that you were that interested, John. I thought it was a hobby for you. Do you even remember what broke us up? You left, you went to film school, and then you went to Los Angeles-- Well, I guess you don't. You pushed me out the door. I wanted you to take me with you. Oh, no, you didn't. You accused me of ignoring you. And next thing I know, you're going out to the bar with all your friends, staying out all night. You were the most important thing in the world to me, and you threw it away with-- with insecurities and jealousy. I-- I was scared. You're still scared, Jennifer. Do you ever wanna leave? How do you mean? I mean, move somewhere, like New York or L.A. or London. I think you're more likely to make that than me. Seriously? Don't say that. What? -You could do so much. -Stop, come on. You can! You can sing, you can dance, you can act, and-- and directing. You are an incredible director. Jen, I'm just happy to be with you. Okay? If you wanna go, then I wanna go. If you wanna be there, then I wanna be there. And I want you to wanna do it. I do. I just want it to be the both of us. -Really? -Yeah. Of course. Hey! Good morning, lil' chickadee. And how are you this lovely fall day? I'm good. How are rehearsals comin'? Okay. Wish I had a couple of stronger dancers. You comin' to get tickets? You got a minute, Katherine? Oh. Since I'm still tryin' to get you on stage... for you, I have two. Have you ever thought of giving up? Theater? Why, you not liking what you're seeing on stage lately? No, I'm sorry. I meant the daily grind. Does it ever wear on ya? Well, I mean, theater has its stresses, always. You know, actors don't show up for rehearsal, stage managers think that they're the director. But you know, at the end of the day, there is this guy, and he always makes me smile when I'm like "Bleh." Was he ever in the business? Oh, hell, no. I've done that. They compete. And it's really hard to find a fellow theater person who supports you completely. Ah, I was just curious. You always seem so put together. Yeah, I get up at five in the morning to meditate, too. What's goin' on? Hm. I was looking at photos. Shoulda, coulda, woulda, I kinda think-- Oh, don't do that. The past is too easy to dwell on. It's the future that should be your target. Were you afraid when you moved to New York? Oh, no. That was like coming home. Movin' here, was that a shock? Uh, no. I mean, I've lived in smaller places all my life, including where I was born in the Philippines, so you know, this place, with its thriving theater community? It took me, like, five minutes to adjust. Uh, I don't think I'll ever leave. Artistic director at the Dallas Theater Center. Ooh. Oregon Shakes. Hey. I gotta get to work. Thanks, Katherine. No problem, baby. -Oh! And one more thing. -Rehearsal's at five. How'd you know? I look at photos, too. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. Stop! All right, ladies. Let's call it a day. Uh, after watching that, I need to have a drink. Now, just remember, we open in three weeks. And even though I know the dance, I'm not gonna be on stage with you. Let that sink in. Get it together. There are times that I question her-- Don't say it! We took the show. Yeah, but my mother does not speak to me the way that she does. Oh. Did I see you speaking to John Raymond the other day? I mean, I met him on auditions a few weeks ago, but I didn't know him before then. -I'd French him. -What'd you say? It's true. He's hot. What does "hot" mean? It means good-lookin', and she's right. Plus, he has a great body. -How would you know? -I heard it from somewhere. You're supposed to say that. I think. It doesn't matter if they're hot, good-looking, great body. None of that matters. What matters is that you control the man. The man needs to know his place. You see, Davie only likes being around me because he knows other men want to be around me, including you. Keep the men in their place, ladies. They'll keep coming back. Take my hand. Hooked. Come on, Henry, let's go. I don't know what's worse, small-town gossip or small-town politics. It's like being in a meeting at Buck Tessel. It's too funny, man. You know, I grew up with half of those giants of industry. Mmm. Hey, Bear. Don't be too long. It's hot. Go ahead and take the car. If I get beat up again, I'll walk. What do you want, Jenny? I wanted to apologize. You were right. I am scared. You know, we don't even know each other. Okay? So, if you have a problem with me, we don't have to see each other. It is a small town. Yeah. And I bet you have the same routine every day. Am I that predictable? Yeah. You always have been. Everyone around here says they don't get me. They're lying. Maybe not. Maybe only one person ever got me. Maybe. Do you ever think about me? So, I guess this is the scene where I grab you, and kiss you passionately, then? Please, stop! Ten minutes. Whoo! You're doing great, Mrs. Devlin. That's nice. -She didn't mean it. -It's been so long, I thought I was gonna fall flat on my face. You look great. And you look happy. I am having fun. Forgot what that was like. Ooh. Sit down. So, what else are we doing? You mean in the show? Yeah. You got plenty to do. Might even add a bit more. Mmm. Hey, your boyfriend was here the other day. When was John here? And he's not my boyfriend, I don't think. Mmm, few days ago. Was shooting a scene in here. He didn't say anything. Should he have? I mean, no. Damn it, Katherine. I kissed him. - Cool. - I know! After study hall, right? Is it that bad? Little bit. It's kind of funny, you Miss Even-Keel, like, head up. Yeah. Was it everything you remembered? Much better. Oh, my God, much better. It was like I was 16 again, and I was scared that my parents were gonna see this. Yeah. What's next? Well-- I was thinking about going to his hotel, - taking off all my clothes, - Ah. tying a ribbon around my waist, waiting for him to come in, and singing "Happy Birthday." His birthday's in January. I know. How do you know that? He worked for me, Miss Jealous. Sounds like you're making progress. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. -Oh, hey, Bear. -Hey! - Where's your shadow? - In a meeting. He's doin' his best to put together a Wilmington team. Ah, uh, Bear, this is my baby brother, Tim. Tim, this is John's right hand man, Bear Burley. - Hi. - Hey. -Bear's from Brooklyn. -Oh, Brooklyn! I love Brooklyn. -Yeah. -Where in Brooklyn? East Flatbush. Oh, they have great Jamaican food there. Yeah, man. Hey, can I meet up with you in a bit? I need to drop by the house and check on the old man. Oh, where were you going? Oh, we were gonna go have a drink or six. Gotta be five o'clock somewhere. Well, I can take you some place. Well, we could go have a bite, and grab a drink. I know this little café, that's not really a café, it's more like a dump. But I like to imagine it's a café. - Interested? - Sure. All right. Well, I'll just meet up with you in a bit. - Yeah. - Let's go. So... -tell me about yourself. -Oh, my God, so cute. Well, I'm 5'11". - I'm a Leo. - Hmm. And I like long walks-- Hey, you. Hey, you. You busy? I am. I got a kinda meeting to go to. But I'll be done by 10:00, though. Oh, what kind of a meeting? It's a surprise. But I can meet you later. Okay. Where? Uh, how about Apple-- Uh, uh, uh. Stop. No chance. Well, there's always Lula's. That sounds better. Let's say about 10:30. - Sure. See you there. - Bye. You sleepin' with my wife? You still screwin' around with Arlene? Why'd you get out? I always wanted money. Davie, I think you need to take a look at what you're really angry about. And why's that? You live your life, like it's one big party. My family built this town. Yeah, and that's true. And everybody loved your father. Yeah, I don't. I can do what I want. Terrible person, aren't I? Yeah. Yeah, you are. But you can change all that if you want to. Do I have to admit how I hurt people? I don't know. But you can just apologize to 'em. I slept with Jenny. While you guys were dating. We were just kids. That really bothered me. Yeah, that's why you married her. 'Cause that was your penance. You should probably head on home, yeah? Yeah, you're probably right. Hey. Make it a beer. Oh, my favorite. Free beer. I was gonna drink that. You quit drinking. And don't try to come up with some half-baked story about how you've had a bad day, because that-- It just seems like an excuse. You're a filmmaker. You know half the people in this town aren't makers of anything, and you're the guy that creates their escapes. You know what that's like when you come rollin' into town? You're a hero. I'm not a hero, Darrell. You're wanting to do something to impress my sister. Who does these shoot-em-up mob flicks, and then just tries your hand at romantic comedy crap? I mean, how stupid do you think these people are? Maybe the mayor. Yeah, I suppose you're right. I might not be after the woman I thought I was. I just got some news. I think I made a mistake, coming here tonight. John, I'm not trying to run you off. This-- You work really hard, and I don't want to see you throw away something that... you tried to create. I see what you brought here. This stuff is a crutch. You get that. Thanks, Darrell. Tell your sister I had to, uh, take off. You tell her yourself. - Hey, mister. - Hi. Do you stand me up? -Something came up. -Mm-hmm. But, let's take a raincheck. Sure. Is it too soon in this thing for a kiss? Yeah. Well, hey, Bear said that we're gonna go to a movie? Uh, yeah, sure. Tomorrow. - Yeah. - Okay. Bye. What was that? Bad day. Needed some air. Said he got some bad news. I'm telling him. -Oh, hey, John? -Not now, Katie. It's not true. What do you mean? He didn't have sex with Jenny. Were you listening? No-- I was just walking up, that's it. I remember the story. You guys, I think, were, like, 25, or something? You were having trouble. You're good. Really good. You shouldn't be in this town. It's not that easy. Jennifer, you know it's-- it's not what you know, it's who you know, and I've never shot at film. Why the hell am I going to LA? I mean, New York makes more sense. Then go to New York! But damn it, get out of here! Is that what you really want? What? Have you stay here with me for some noble hope, that we'll be together forever? Do you know how ridiculous that is? We're kids. I'll probably meet someone the minute you leave. I love you, Jenny. Go to hell. And then she went drinking. 18 was the drinking age, so I was legal, I was there, and she came here and got bombed. Or Davie and his money helped her get drunk. Darr, just give me another drink. You've had enough. Sit tight and I'll drive you home when I leave. One beer. Yeah, one beel-- Deer. You're on a short leash anyway, pal. Gotta change the keg. Mm-hmm. Yeah. -Mm. -Mm-hmm. So, what did he say? He's just gonna leave me here to fend for myself. I'd never leave you. That's sweet. He just doesn't understand how much I love his sorry ass. Why I've done everything for him. Oh, no, that's not true. He's done everything for me. When he's gone, what'll I do? I'll take care of you. That's true-- I can give you everything you need. That is so sweet. But I don't need money. I just need someone to care. Not here, you idiot! People are watching. Get your car, bring it around the back. And I'll-- I'll be there in a second. You're not really going with him, are you? What does it matter? I'm all alone. Don't got anyone. I think you've had too much to drink. I'll make that choice. Who are you, anyway? I'm nobody, but I'll take you home. -I got a date. -Right. Okay. Just trying to help. You're kiddin' me, right? You're just like a child. Oh! Mm. How about I take you home, Jenny? I'm gonna go to another bar. Okay, how about I take you to another bar? In Fayetteville, cause I know I can find a man in Fay-- Okay. Shh. Fayetteville. I'll drive anywhere you want to go. Mm. Okay. Watch your head. Okay. Ready? Need to get it where you can. I know what you mean. God. So, you really can't hold any of this against her. Why wouldn't she say anything to me? Did you ever ask her? No. You guys are so strange. You go off on each other and you never ask any questions, do you? I guess that's always been the problem. He was all lovey-dovey this afternoon. And he blows me off? Think it was work or something? I don't know. I-- I don't know. I know. What? Davie told him you were sleeping together while you and John were still a thing. And John believed him? He did at first... and then Katie told him it wasn't true. Probably should have finished that last sentence before she left. - Yeah. - Shot? -Yes. -Yeah, two shots. Mm. Ah. -Oh. -Yeah. I love that. So-- Where is he? Oh, uh, I'm fine. Tim took me to this little Italian café. -The pizza there was-- -Where is he? Oh, you're serious, huh? He-- he's in the bathroom upstairs. You believed that idiot without even asking me about it? -You're naked. -I know. Why are you naked? Uh, I'm usually naked right before I take a shower. Why did you believe him without asking me? Do you really want to do this like this? I can take it if you can take it. Great. I didn't know how to react. But then Katie explained everything to me, and I understand it now. Wait, what? Yeah, when I went outside, Katie was out there. And up until this point, you still didn't think about asking me about it? Well-- you... no. Why? I don't know. 'Cause I was jealous. And I was hurt. And shocked. And you couldn't even come into the bar. I felt ashamed of the way I acted. But I get it now. You didn't even trust me enough to ask me if it was true, John. I didn't need to. Katie gave me the answers. Well, let's see if she can keep that up. Where you going? Back to the way life was before. Wait. John... I missed you for a long time. But I wonder if I've missed you or the fantasy I have of you. Jenny. Come on. Good luck with the movie, John. What didn't I say? Maybe "I'm sorry"? So in all the years you've been here, you've never felt it? Let me tell you something. To most people, I'm Japanese or Chinese. Filipino, what's Filipino? Hey, Jenny. She just busted in? Yeah, that was one unhappy lady. Yeah, well, when you're not trusted, that hurts, you know? Well, from what I've heard around town, it's a two-way street with those two. Yeah. Hey, does John know she's in the show? I don't think so. Hm. You know, you should really see her dance, Bear. You'd never know she'd been away from this for so long. Oh, my God! What happened? I don't know, my ankle. - Must have spun around weird. - Okay, come on. Can you help me get to the green room? All right. Yep. Don't put any weight on it. Here. Hey, where's that pillow? Can I do anything else? Get back to work. - Let's go. - Hey, can one of you -get me a salad? -A salad? I'm hungry. I'll take care of my foot, you take care of my stomach. Okay. Right. Go, go, go. Go. Let's go. Think we got enough witnesses? I believe so. You really think this is gonna work? So, here's the deal. I want Jenny in this role. Her confidence is shot to hell. This makes her look like a hero. I get exactly what I wanted. And when John sees her, they'll figure out a way to speak again. And if it blows up? Then, I look like an idiot. And you can say "I told you so." -Mm. -Hey, I'm doing this -for you, too, you know. -How you figure that? Your boss's happiness might get you a raise. Well, I'll take the raise, but what I really need is to be around some sane people. You think those girls are gonna say anything at the diner? I think they'll tell three people at the stop sign in front of the theater. You crazy. Did you hear it snap or something? I don't know, but she said a salad would help her ankle feel better. So, how much is it? Take it. Please. Thank you. Bless her heart. Now what happened? I'm realizing that Katherine hires morons. -Is everything okay? -Oh, uh-- Katherine was rehearsing her stuff, and she turned her ankle wrong. - Is she all right? - Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you go over there? Why? Because I know your secret. What? Yeah, Katherine let it slip to a few people. - Damn it. - It's cool. It's cool. I can handle things here. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Piece of cake. -Thanks, Shell. -Sure! I will let you know what I find out. Okay. Hey. Yeah. No, she's on her way. Nope. Not a thing. - Ooh. - Katherine? Oh. Katherine. I just heard. -What happened? -Hi. I don't know, I like, pirouetted wrong or something and there was a crack. -Did you hear a crack? -Huh? What-- Oh. It cracked. - Ugh. - Oh. Yeah, it was just some, like, dumb, freakish accident. Hurts like a mother. What are you going to do about the show? Oh, my God, the show. Uh, I don't know. What are we gonna do about the show? What are my options, Mallory? I know the combinations. I could do it? Too young. Next. I don't really know. What would you guys do, Bear? We get somebody else. But there's nobody else. Well, then, we pick up the phone, and we-- How tough are the combinations? Oh, my God, they're so simple. They're so simple. If I can get someone to help me with the lines, I'll do it. Ah, oh, Jenny, that's so great of you, but I-- It's gonna be a lot of work. We don't start shooting 'til next week. -I can help you. -Oh, that's so sweet, Bear, but-- but Jenny, it's been such a long time. I can do this. I don't have anything else on my schedule. Okay. Mallory's basically gonna live with you for a week. Oh, my God! Thank you, Katherine. - Oh. - Finally, someone trusts me. - Let's do this. - Okay. Oh, yes! Now, that's a woman with an axe.

Hey, Mallory. Everything okay? That was the most amazing thing I've ever seen, Mrs. Hill. Oh, stop. And please stop calling me Mrs. Hill. We're peers now. Call me Jenny. No, we're not. You're what I'd hoped I'd be. When I was a little girl, back in Chapel Hill. I worked and studied and danced 'til my feet bled. I was up at five, I never left the studio before 11. My mom was a great fan. She never made me do anything I didn't want to do. She's the reason I'm here. She's the reason I came to Wilmington to study with Katherine after graduation. Sounds like a great mom. She uprooted her whole life to bring her baby girl here. To study with Katherine. I mean, technically, I could dance circles around you, Mrs. Hill. Jenny. But I don't have your heart. That was magical. Hm. Thank you, Mallory. I know everyone says I'm a dummy, but... I don't think anyone could make me feel the way you made me feel when you were performing. You've got... it. Mallory. What do you dream about? I don't dream. I don't really sleep much. -Right? -I guess it's all the time-- Oh, there's a star! Yeah, I'm one of them, I guess. Were you in on this, too? Nope. They kept it from me, too. Well, it was a brilliant plan, and I got exactly what I wanted in the first place. Wanna talk? Yeah, I think we should. You know, I forgot how much I miss the nights over here. It's hard to breathe in L.A. I didn't think you were coming. I wasn't. Then, I saw Katherine on the news and I had a hunch. You haven't missed a beat. No, I don't know. Hey, I wanted to say I'm sorry. Yeah? It's weird, switchin' places for a change, huh? You being the jealous type? It's not a place I like to live. I'll admit that. But I promise, Jenny, and if you were-- John. I'm moving. To New York. What? Katherine has a line on a job for me, plus some contacts that I could meet. But I'm-- I was thinking that, if we spent some time here-- I have never really done anything for myself. Don't you think it's time I should? Yeah, of course. Of course. But think about-- If you and I-- John. Look. I love you. I want you in my life. But just this once, don't you think I should try? I mean, you yourself said that I'm afraid. Shouldn't I stop living afraid? When are you gonna leave? After the run. Well, is there anything I can help with? You've already done so much. Really? -Mm-hmm. -What have I done? I wasn't going to have the confidence if it weren't for you. Oh. You made me believe again. You did all that by yourself. God, you're gonna be great. Well, I had a great teacher. And I'll only be a phone call away. Yeah, I know. But you're gonna be busy. Don't forget, I lived the New York life. How fast is it? It's faster than L.A. In L.A., you can lose your job... just own it. In New York? You lose everything. Oh, God. Hey, but not you. You're gonna do great things. Proud of you. That might be the best thing you've ever said to me. Hey, Katherine. How are you? I'm great. Hey, I have you scheduled for an audition for a new show in a couple of weeks. A friend of mine's directing. Uh, I can't leave work. You didn't go to New York to be a receptionist. I know, but it's hard to get-- Auditions start at ten, and I have you down at 12:30, right before lunch. What's the project? Pal of mine's written something. He's been working on it a long time. He thinks it's ready, and drummed up some backers, so wants to try it out at Hartford, possibly move to New York. Well, this is really exciting, Katherine. Thank you. Don't thank me yet. You better be ready. Whenever you're ready. I do declare, Mr. Greenfield-- Let's start that again.

I loved your audition, and-- and I would really, really be hopeful you'd take the role of Jana. You've gotta be kidding. Oh, no. When I saw you at the audition, when I heard the words coming out of your mouth, it was like I had written it just for you. This has gotta be a joke. There's no way. No. -No joke. -John? I wrote it for you. You're so sappy. Yeah. Yeah.
