Hasn't been used in a while. Rusty... Here we go! That's the telephone. -Hello there? -Do I speak with Florida? "Longing 202" speaking. 202? Sorry, wrong number. This is B410205. What's this with your longing? Where do you live? -Whom are you talking to? -She says, she's longing... You must be crazy. She's worth a million. No, not a million. 202, she says. Hello, this is Florida. Yes, in person. If you can come over, you ask? Of course, we already long for you. 202... Splitter... Milady, hello? Your connection has been discontinued. But Mrs., we want to pay... I'm sorry, I have to interrupt you. -You'll have the money tomorrow. -As if. Hello, I'm cutting the line. Now our phone is discontinued.

I sure hope to see you again. One moment... Mrs., please excuse me. You're expecting a letter? What a shame. If I had known this, I would've written you one.

Now, enough with this following business. I think so, too. If this doesn't stop, we'll soon be in Schönbrunn. Mrs., a single word and I'm gone in a second. -So, what is it? -When will I see you again? -Never! -Can't you give me a more precise date? That's precise enough, isn't it? It isn't.

No one's on the line. Oh yes, naturally. -What do you mean? -Let me for a minute, I'll deal with it. Hello... Hello!... I don't get it. HOME OPERATOR What's that? -Slow line. -Slow line? Oh, now I get it. The slow line is busy, I'll transfer to the short one. Hello? Hello! -Operator speaking. -Mrs., please put me through to 30206. 30206. In a moment. -Hello mother? -Hello, Fischer and Weber speaking. -Whom am I speaking to? -Fischer and Weber. Wrong number. Please hang up. Goddamn it! -Mrs., I got the wrong number. -I'm sorry, won't happen again. -30206, if I may. -30206. In a moment. The line is busy. What's this? Have you gone mad? What's with the lad out there? He must be off his rockers. I can't get a connection. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Wiesinger. Say, I went to the advertisement agency. That goldfish also swam away. It's over, we're finished. May I introduce: Miss Longing. -Wait... You're Longing...? -...202! That's... That's marvelous. That's wonderful. -Get a chair for the lady. -Will do. May I offer a lemonade... a lemon... a cold glass of water... -No, thank you. -At least take a seat. That's amazing. -So everything's settled? -So far yes. About the specifics... Yes, about the salary. -What sal... -About the salary, naturally. Of course, the salary is important for you. -It is. -Of course. Well, what were you thinking of? I thought... maybe... 100. -100 -50... Maybe 150! 150! This we can do, can we? -Granted! -Yes, yes... And while you're in a good mood, I've got another request. Another request? Granted, too! We're very generous. Can I have one month's pay in advance? -A... Advance? -Gra... Granted, of course. He's the one granting the advances. -Splitter! -Yes? Take the lady to the office and show her the rooms. We'll take care of the advance later on, of course. Out of the way. May I? I'm sure you'll like it here. Did I do well with the phone? -Splitter! -Yes? -Come on! -Oh yes... Behave yourself. No ring ring and stuff like that. Say, moron, you're promising her 150 schillings? -What do you call me? A moron? -Yes I do. -What are you, then? -Your partner. You almost blew it right no. Super-moron! -Beautiful rooms. -Yes, they are. -I like it very much. -Glad to hear. I don't get it. What does she need 150 schillings, being a millionaire's daughter? That's just her quirk. One flies over the ocean, the other collects Maybugs... So what will she do in December? And this one wants to earn her own money. And so she should! But not our money! Say, is it always that quiet here? Yes... yes, how could you think that... Sometimes... it's slower... sometimes not that much... sometimes not at all... But that doesn't mean anything, it's just because... ...because... today is Friday, the 13th! -Is that so? -Oh yes, people are superstitious. On some Fridays I... almost look forward to Sundays. So how can we get hold of 150 schillings? Do you know what we've sold since yesterday? A toothbrush! In installments. And you want 150... Ridiculous! Say, Bobby, come here. -I've got an idea. -Unbelievable! -But don't get mad. -On the contrary. A rare occasion anyway. So what is it? I... I want to sell the ring. This ring? That I gave to you as a present? You should be ashamed. My friend, beggars can't be choosers. That's just a phrase. You can't sell the ring. And where can we find the money? I don't care. This ring you can't sell. -I have to. -No you don't. -I will. -You won't. I forbid it. -And why? -Because... it's a forged rock. To make it short: a solid business. I can see that. So this is the register? That's the register, but it doesn't work. Out of order. But here you have the list, for comparison. In line one there's Eau de Cologne, in line two there's lavender... -You there! -One moment! And in line three there's red... -Oh, hello! -Where are the bosses? My bosses? In there. But they can't be disturbed right now. An important meeting. -I have to talk to them. -Think about it, won't you... Not when money is involved. Be reasonable, you can't barge in like... -Who was that? -Him? He's a money man. He wants to force his capital on us. But we don't need it. I you won't pay this minute, I'll tear down the building today. -That's unpleasant, isn't it Harry? -I'll say. Then I guess we'll have to... well... Dear Property manager, can I offer a pawn? -A pawn? -Yes, a souvenir, from a true friend. All right. But if you won't pay tomorrow, your ring is gone. Well... well, what can we do. -Bye. -Go with god. Don't you pout. I'll return exactly the same ring to you. -See you! -See you! One moment, please. A forged ring can be useful, too. So what's going on? Are we out on the street. -For now we're fine. -Thank god. If only we had money for the advance. -An advance? For me? -For you? For the girl, of course. -For the millionairess! -Advance... What's going on, what's going on. Who do you think you are? -Paul! -Magda! -Paul, listen, I got the job! -How wonderful. -So what is it you will be doing? -I'll be a salesgirl. -I'll be your first customer, then. -You are? I need a dozen razor blades for my boss. Marvelous, I'll get them for you. Follow me. Here are the razor blades. -But this is a pack of 120! -Doesn't matter. They're always useful. -Maybe a cream? -For my shoes? No, for your face. Smell this! Nice cream. You won't find anything here. What's this? -Nothing, unfortunately. -I thought so. 160 schillings altogether. 160 schillings! That's something else. For this kind of money, I should've bought a new tire. This here is much more important. -One moment! -What is it? Ms. Wurmser owes 300 schillings since three months ago. -This is it! -No it ain't! I already collected the 300 schillings myself. -And where are they now? -Here. -Very nice. -Isn't it? -Very nice. -What's that? How dare you... There's only one thing left to do. One of us has to go out and tell her that we don't pay advances on principle. Very well. I'm going out and you tell her. Too bad about Ms. Wurmser. Say, where should I put the money? The register doesn't work. -Where does this money come from? -I collected it. -How did you collect it? -For the merchandise I sold. -Someone bought something from us? -Naturally. It's not all that natural... Mrs., we're very sorry, your advance can't... ...be held back any longer. 150 schillings, wasn't it? -Yes. -Of course we'll have to subtract the tax. -Splitter! -Yes? -Hand over the tax table. -The tax table. -We have to, unfortunately... So that makes... No! That's the one from yesterday, it's no longer valid today. Sorry, my mistake. Not your first one. Tax on income, unemployment, bachelorhood, crisis, salary, insurance, labor, welfare. Altogether that makes... We'll come out just about even in the end. -You can't do that. -Why not? She's got millions. So, 150 schillings, right? Here you go, tax-free. Thanks a million. Thanks. She really took it. Well, still 10 schillings left. For my partner... net gain. A gentleman from head to toe. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 This one is old, but rich. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 king of spades, jack of spaces, ace of spades. Three black ones... A negro? No, auntie, he isn't a negro. He isn't old, either. Aside from that, you got it. If you don't pay, I will cut the light. -You simply can't to that. -Oh, it's very simple. The display window needs much more light. More light? Only recently, we installed marvelous effect lighting. -You did? -Effect lighting! Look for yourself. I don't get it. What's going on? My friend, think it over. There's a millionairess sitting outside. -So make her pay! -She's not supposed to know! -By the way, how much is the bill? -80 schillings. 80 schillings. Well, turn on the light for a moment so that I can have a look. Will do. -Strange. -Indeed. Forget it. Maybe... for now... 5... schillings... OK? Are you joking? That won't do, no deal. Just as a down payment, you... No no no, I can't wait any longer, I'll cut it again. And then there was light. I just moved my hand like this. That's the end of it. Good night! What's going on? Who's horsing around with the light? What do you think? The light has been cut, because of 80 schillings. 80 schillings? I got it right here. Turn on the light for a minute. If you insist. One last time. -Did you see this? -Yes, I did. Suddenly it was dark again. I just did this... I left my coat upstairs. But do return tomorrow, then I'll have it down here. -Are you trying to make a fool of me? -I swear, I'll have it down here! I'm cutting it now. And that's that. -Did you see this? -Of course. I don't understand. Me neither. I got to have a secret power. Every time I'm doing this... -Did you see? -No, I don't see anything. -Closing time! -So early? There's a short-circuit, so we're closing up. -Got it. -No, not a short-circuit. It was me! -If you allow, I'll walk you out. -Thank you very much. Good evening! -See you. -See you. -Boss, it was me! -What do you mean? -One moment! -What's with you? I got it. If you insist. Not like that. I'm talking about the short-circuit. That was me! -That was the electricity guy. -What are you talking about? The electricity guy switched the light on and... For heaven's sake! So that's why. Now I'm beginning to see. -Good evening! -Good evening! -How nice to meet you! Good evening! -Good evening! I'm Wiesinger. And you must be the mother. The similarity is right there. -This is my aunt. -You're aunt! I... couldn't have known. Nice of you to join us.

"Thanks very much, and best wishes to our mutual cousin." That beats everything! -Good morning! -Good morning! -Well, so early? -What do you mean, early? It's almost 8. You need to put a bit more imagination into all of this. Imagination! Can't help it if I haven't got one. Invisible advertisement isn't worth anything. That's what I mean. Here, in the shop window, we must make changes. -Something that catches the eye. -Exactly. -Do you think I could give it a try? -Of course, you can do anything you want. Perfect. Say, is there anything special the bosses are interested in? They are only interested in being left alone. Ridiculous. -Bobby! -What is it? -Telephone! -What? -Telephone! -Oh, I thought this was the alarm clock. Hello, what... That's ridiculous. In the middle of the night! Hello. -Who was it? -The super.

Well, can't help it, then. -So what is it? -Your precious ring, of course. Oh, he already found out. And now? Eviction. -Really? -Yes! What can we do? -The bottles, please. -Here you go. -Beautiful. -Isn't it? -And the fan. -Fan? Why do you need a fan? -For the burning question. -Why? Oh, now I get it. You really are very skillful. My friend, there's only one hope left. You have to borrow from the millionairess. -Me? Not a chance. -Why did we hire her? Why do I have to do everything all the time? Because you are more handsome. Yes, you look like a film star. Your charm, your sex appeal, the blank expression of your eyes, so... Harry, be reasonable. It's a dire situation. Get dressed, will you! -Finished? -Yes, in a moment. -Please turn on the fan now. -The fan, will do. -Thank you. -The ribbon isn't in place. To the right! To the left, from your point of view. -Thank you. Now bring me a nail, please. -A nail? A big one or a small one? -Done! Now what do you think? -Marvelous! BLIND Look at this! I'll have a closer look. DEAF -How original! -Excellent advertisement! -Is this fine? -Beautiful, indeed. -Now, please help me down. -Just take my hand. PLEASE COME IN. WE CAN'T PRESENT EVERYTHING IN THE SHOP WINDOW. Look at this! A tiny bit of packaging goes a long way. Marvelous. Excuse me, please let me through. One moment, please. -Good morning, Sir. -Good morning, Miss. -I came in. -How nice of you. -What can I show you? -What I couldn't see in the window. One moment. Good morning, Sir. What can I show you? You? Nothing! The young lady on the other hand... -Hello, Miss. -Hello, Sir. I came in... I'd like to, I saw in the... Please, gentlemen! Not all at once! -Good morning! -What do these people want? -Tell them we pay on Sunday. -But those are customers! -Customers? -Of course. -Good morning. -Good morning. -These really are customers? -Of course. -Where do they come from? -The new girl rearranged the shop window. What a pleasant thing to hear. Four bottles of eau de cologne, please. -Four bottles eau de cologne. -That's the phone bill, right there. -Five bottles lavender. -And there's the light bill. Marvelous. Tell her to see us in the office for a moment. -She's with a customer right now. -Then you will cover for her. -I don't know. That one guy didn't like me. -I can relate. One moment, one moment. We'll make sure to deliver all of this. -In person? -You can bet on that. -See you later, then. -See you later. One moment, now it's my turn. Miss, out there, in the show window... Sorry, the bosses want you in the office. -But I'm with customers! -I'll cover for you. -One moment, please. -Miss, please stay! -Sir how can I help you? -You can't, I already told you that. Disgusting evasiveness. Goodbye. -See you. -I knew he doesn't like me. -Good morning! -Good morning! -You want to talk to me? -My partner needs to tell you something. -Correct? -Yes, correct, I... ...he's a bit shy. I hope you understand. Won't you take a seat? -It's just... -Now he can talk more freely. Am I right? Well? Well... I... I'm supposed to... -I'd like to ask you something. -Go on! I wanted to tell you something that is very close to my heart. -But we just met. -Yes. -Two days ago. -I said that, too. My partner talked me into it, though. -Talked you into it? -Yes, because I was afraid to tell you. To be honest, I'm afraid even now. I think I already know. Really? Thank heavens, that's a relief. -So... can I hope? -I have to talk to my mother, first. Do that! When can I expect an answer? -Is it that urgent? -Yes, very urgent. Maybe I'll see you tonight? I'll call you. -Deal? -Deal! -You really are charming. Thanks a lot! -You're welcome. Miss, if you allow, might I ask for an advance right now? Splitter, Splitter... I'm so happy! -What's that? -Me... I... What's going on? Did you talk to her? -Yes. -And did she give you something? -Yes, a kiss. -What are you saying? You know, I think I proposed to her. -You were supposed to ask for a loan. -I did. But she misunderstood. -And now? -And now we go on a date. How nice. You'll tell her then. And no misunderstandings this time. -Nothing doing? -Sorry? -Now that I know that she loves me I can't. -Is that so? I'll tell her, then. -Hey, hey, I forbid it! -I'll do it anyway. -I'll make sure you don't. -No chance. Want to take a bet? -We'll see. -We'll see, exactly. We'll... -Kitty! -Bobby! What brings you here? I want to get to know you in your field of action. That's sweet of... Splitter, please go and find out what time it is. -It's nice here. -It is? Do you like it? Yes, indeed. So, what do you have on offer? My lady, let's see. Our own make, available in all sizes and prize levels. Oh, how beautiful. COURT OF EXECUTION, VIENNA -This must be your trademark. -Yes, our trademark. What kind of funny animal is this? -That's a vulture. -A vulture? Yes, there's one of them on all of our bottles. How many do you want? Not a single one. I came by to tell you I'm free tonight and want to go out with you. -Tonight won't do. -Why not? Tonight I'll have to take inventory. I'll be busy all night. I'm sorry about that, poor you. I'll have to think of you all night, then. -Kitty, you must change perfumes. -Why? That one's dangerous for me. ♫ My dearest I'm in love with your perfume ♫ Because it puts me in the right mood ♫ I don't know what it is, I only realize ♫ There's something, there's something, there's something ♫ My dearest, I'm so fond of your perfume ♫ It brings us together, even when you're far away ♫ It smells of kisses that only happen once ♫ I'm in love with your perfume I don't like you going out with your boss at night. But mother, if you only knew him. He's so harmless. Those are the worst, believe me, I know. I can't go like this, anyway. My god, nothing to wear. What do you mean? Your blue dress is very nice. -No, I can't wear that. -Why? It's way too short. Oh, I forgot. These days, long dresses are in style again. Wait a minute! I got an idea! Well, what about this one? -Isn't this grandma's ball dress? -Yes, it is. -And I'm supposed to wear it? -It's all the rage now! -But mother, that won't work. -Wait and see! Say Harry, where are you going to meet her? So we won't end up at the same place. -We're going to the Moulin Rouge. -The Moulin Rouge, interesting. Have fun. -One moment, did you hear that? -What are you saying? -Didn't you hear it? -You and your jokes. -There's something going on in there. -Then take a look! -I'm afraid. -What a hero. You go. You're the stronger one. So, who did win the bet? I was never smarter. And now I'm going to get money from the millionairess. Do not get bored in the meantime. Open up, scoundrel! Don't forget to bring out the shoes. -Well, isn't this lovely? -Yes, very modern. And at the same time, just like in the olden days. That dress! I've rarely seen anything so sweet. -Do you really like it? -All I can say is: cheers! Waiter! -Won't you tell me already about... -...the waiter? He'll be here in a moment. -No, I... -Yes, he will. Just a little... I'm talking about your partner! Oh, you're talking about Harry. Well, as I told you, he is indisposed, and he asked me to fill in for him, as far as... Are you saying he won't show up at all? He will! As soon as he manages to free himself up. Are you that unhappy about the substitute? -You aren't? Well then, cheers! -Cheers! -My friend Harry talked to you today. -Yes, he did. -And while doing so, he... -Yes, he did. -No he didn't, that's the thing. It was... -I'm sorry. -What's that? -May I? -Please excuse me. -Well, that... -One moment, how much are these liqueurs? -4 schillings. -Both of them? -8 schillings. Then bring me... one more. ♫ My dearest I'm in love with your perfume ♫ Because it puts me in the right mood Auntie, I don't get it. Why shouldn't I call him? -Because it is not proper. -Why not? The poor guy's taking inventory. ♫ My dearest, I'm so fond of your perfume ♫ It brings us together, even when you're far away ♫ It smells of kisses that... -I am going to call him! -Kitty! Yes, I'm calling him. -Hello! Help! -What? What happened? -Help! The rascal locked me in! -I'll call the police immediately! ♫ My dearest I'm in love with your perfume ♫ Because it puts me in the right mood ♫ I don't know what it is, I only realize ♫ There's something, there's something, there's something You left me here... Terrible, that noise! -By the way, we were interrupted. -Yes, we were. -What is it you wanted to say? -I... Impossible with this music. It's about... Thank heavens! It's about making a dream come... Here we go again. It's about making a dream come true. -May I have this dance? -I don't know. I beg you. You can't deny me this waltz. Ain't I right, Sir? -Please excuse me. -Thank you. -I'm sorry... Hey there, you! -What do you want? -All this dance music all the time! -Of course, this is a dance bar. -The orchestra plays whatever one wants? -Yes, why not? Then tell them to play rummy for a while. Hello! Is anybody here? Look over there. Someone's knocking. Turn on the light! -Hands in the air! -I beg your pardon? -Hands in the air! -But I'm the owner! -Anyone could say that. -Good evening. Good evening. My good friend, am I the owner or ain't I? -Does he tell the truth? -Of course. -Why didn't you say so earlier? -Earlier? I couldn't get a word in! And what are you doing in there? Who locked you in? My partner played a stupid joke on me. Unbelievable! Calling the cops for that? I could've died of hunger in there. Maybe that's what you... -Where's Bobby? -And who are you? -I called here just now. -So you were the one setting me free! So where is Bobby? What did you do to him? I to him? He to me! He locked me in! Unbelievable. Let me tell you something. I'll report you for deceiving the authorities. On with it! -Now you see what my partner is up to. -Your partner? He's your partner? -Of course! -He told me he'd be working here all night. Working my ass. He's at the Moulin Rouge, with my girl. Enough dancing already. Now we need to have a talk before the music starts again. -I... My friend thinks, in our business... -May I? Excuse me, may I? Finally, he's left. So, my friend thinks, we need a woman in our business. -Do you want to be a boss at our firm? -Me? He told you lots of silly stuff, probably. But the gist of it, the transaction... -...he doesn't know anything about that. -But I'm no transaction. Well, to me, a few 100.000s schillings feels like business. It's not a lot, but we'll take it. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the money you might... would invest in our business. Charmingly... Me? But I don't have any money. That's something else. A millionairess and no money? Millionairess? But I'm no millionairess! -But you advertised! -Not that I'm a millionairess! Don't fool around! Are you Longing 202 or aren't you Longing 202? -Of course I'm Longing 202! -I knew it. Here, read this. "Lady worth millions..." -Unbelievable! That's a terrible mistake! -What do you mean? -I never advertised this! -Oh my... You don't have any money? -No! -Mrs., you are a swindler! -How dare you! -Stay on your seat, don't make a scene! Now I get it. That's why you hired me. And that's why you were so nice to me! And that's why your friend asked me out! -What a nerve! -She must be jealous. -Shame on you! -What's going on? -Leave me be! -Magda! Here he is, the scoundrel! Making a date with me and going out with another girl. -Why are you here, Kitty? -Why am I here? For this! Thanks a lot. Well hello Harry! How did you escape? You're the most insolent guy I ever met. -You've got me into trouble again. -Me? -We'll talk about it at home. Just wait. -Forget it, we're no longer friends. -From now on you mean nothing to me. -That's right. You're mean less than nothing to me. Vacuum, negative space, black hole. What's that? Heavens, now it starts... ♫ The sky over Vienna ♫ Is twice as nice as anywhere else ♫ Because the whole year long ♫ The sky is full of clouds ♫ A Viennese looks at stars from the office ♫ While thinking about all the unpaid debts Splitter, stop the singing!

If you, by chance, meet my partner, then tell him, that I went to the Hesse advertisement agency... One moment, stay here. ...Went there to put up my share of the business for sale. -Why are you still here? Go! -Yes. -I'm supposed to tell you... -Silence! Silence! Tell my inept partner that I'll sell my shares, too. Go on, tell him! Later. Tell this business moron that I'm finished with him once and for all. Tell this dubious character I'll be happy to never see him again. Tell him! -Never see him... -Tell him that... -Stay here! -Stay here. Splitter, over here! You were supposed to say... -Tell him nothing, nothing left to tell. -I think so, too. -Tell this bleak idiot. -You're a bleak idiot. -Have you gone mad? How dare you? -But he said...
