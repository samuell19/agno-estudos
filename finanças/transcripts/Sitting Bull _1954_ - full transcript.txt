Give you a man exercise encourage sports. I'll run the military end of it. Mr. Webber. You stick to your business. I was a military man when you were a pup, Major Parrish. In an army where discipline came first…… A European army. I thought so. Your orders will be posted at nine o'clock every morning. What time do you feed those Indians ? Once a day, at sunset . Any other questions ? No. Sergeant ? Yes, sir. What is that ? It's Indians feeds, sir. This stuff would sticken a hog. For a fact. It would. Taste that. Take it away.

What ……! what is all this ? What happened here ? You'll know soon enough, I'm afraid. Last night, Parrish, I sent a telegraph to the railhead. Reply from Washington has just come back. Instructions to place you under arrest for court martial. Sergeant. Take charge of your prison. Miss Howell is a general's daughter. Mr. Webber. The words 『Court-Martial』 should be mentioned only in a whisper. Would you explain this to me. Mr. Webber He came here and openly insulted me. I had Indian prisoners, dangerous renegades under discipline. He went among them stirred them up into an outbreak. and finally refused to allow his troops to stop the escape. After all we talked about You have heard his version of it. Now listen to mine. I don't need to hear it. Mr. Webber, tell the escort we're returning to the fort. The pleasure's ours. Immadiately. Sorry sir. Sitting Bull Come. My son. Now will you make war ? Leave me…… with my grief…… Great spirit ! Father of my Fathers ! Here lies the body of my son ! killed without reason ! Listen to the death chant of the women ! Listen to the war cries of the chiefs! Give me your counsel mighty one ! Must there be war ! Is this land not big enough for all people ? Guide me now ! Oh God of my people. war or peace…… war or peace ? We can have war or peace out there. Mr. president. It'll depend on how we treat the Indians. You were called here to explain your conduct at the Red Rock agent say. Nothing more about us. All I did was try to prevent a slaughter. The tribunal thought enough of that defense to recommend a dishonorable discharge. Why didn't the tribunal try Webber ? Because the bureau got rid of whether. And don't yell at me. I'm sorry sir. All I have to do now is sign this discharge. Then you can go up and down the land spouting your ideas. Being the civilian. You'll be under no army discipline and discipline seems to be the thorn in your side. Sit down. You have a brilliant military career ahead of you. Parrish. Youngest Colonel in my command. medal of Honor…… and well earned Out west I thought you'd go to the top. Just what are you trying to do. Get yourself demoted all the way down ? May I speak freely, sir ? Go ahead. You don't settle Indian troubles by shooting Sitting Bull's son in the back. I know that. I suppose you have a plan to maintain Sitting Bull grow around his teepee We're dealing with the whole Sioux Nation. For a thousand years these people have roamed ------ From Minnesota to the Tetons. Ten thousand Braves seven Nations. There are a proud people. They'd be fighting us now with every drop of blood that was in it, But for one thing. What's that ? Sitting Bull. their spiritual leader. The man that they look up to even more than Crazy Horse in the fighting Chiefs. Sitting Bull alone is holding These people in check. Why ? May be it's because he knows that the next war will be the end of his people. Mr. president. Brain Sitting Bull here to Washington. Treat him with a dignity in the respect that he deserves. and prove to him that our treaties means something that they're not just words on paper. Do you think you could get Sitting Bull to come here to a council I can try. That is, if my hides not hung on a fence by my superior officers. The minute I set foot in Dakota. Our Chinese friends would call out of 『Chuck Gee』. What do your Indians call it ? Medicine, sir. Heap big medicine. Well, that will gets you over the top of army orders, captain. Captain ? in the interest of army discipline. I'm reducing your rank. Very good, sir. Your trouble in the Sioux territory so far. Has been a tea party. But now there's something else waiting there for you. What's that, sir. A rush on the Black Hills. They've discovered gold. Gold ? You'd better arrange that meeting with Sitting Bull. No…No…No…No…No ! Imagine a dirty redskin trying to steal our claim ? What 'll we do with him ? Give her a shovel let her bury him. And now another client comes. This one wants gold. He is worse than their long knives and her blue coats. This one brings his women. He shoots without orders from his Chiefs. He kills game he cannot eat. He fouls the clear water. He has come to stay. Drive him out ! While they're still game, driving them back. Wise as you are, Sitting Bull. Put on the war paint. Yes !put on the war paint ! Speak, Sitting Bull. Give us counsel. When a man draws his arrow on. An enemy He must shoot. When I dip my fingers in the war paint. It will mean…… War. But this I counsel you, Gather all the Nations together before you draw the first arrow. It will seem easy to drive back the men Who want the yellow stones. But if we fight them. We must fight the long knives, the soldiers. So this I counsel you. Send runners to all the Nations of the Sious. To the Cheyenne to the crow. Who have been our enemies. Send runners to all our cousins. Send them now, Crazy Horse. Gather all our armies. We will make sure. Our bow is strung. Before we fit the arrow. See that these bags get to my quarters. Yes sir. Cathy ! Well I didn't expect to see you here. Are you disappointed ? And a captain too, Did you notice ? Yes. We heard about it. What's all this ? A county Fair. Miners, prospectors. My old friend yellow hair. That's quite an army he's captured. Left , Side, Ho! Cathy. Can we go away somewhere where we can talk. Bob !

And he can give you the parties and the theaters and the clothes is that it. ? Yes, yes that's part of it. Can he give you this ? Gonna keep their hands tied. captain ?

I still think there's news in him. Forget Bob, Parrish. I could forget him very easily, Cathy. Soon we will have enough. You know what the joke is, captain ? I can see a few funny spots in it. Feed injun braves like papoose. Tell them I'm sorry. I have to keep their hands tied. I want to be sure they're between me and other cousin. [ SPEAKING SIOUX ] You want another joke, captain. They don't miss anything. I tied injuns hand with rawhide. Dry rawhide. That'll hold them. Every night the dew wets the rawhide. That'll hold them. They can slip their hand out . Every night. And every morning I put them on. How far do you suppose it is to Sitting Bull's camp ? [ SPEAKING SIOUX ] We's there now, captain. We's there now, captain. Kill him ! We's there now, captain. Kill him ! a black brother says you bring a message from your great white chief. Speak, I came to hold council with you, Sitting Bull. White man speaks with many tongues…… all of them twisted. I came from the great white chief of all long Knives I say kill him ! Call this mad dog off. He wants blood, let him fight me the Indian way. It is his right. let it be then the Indian way. I came to hold council. I will listen to the words of your chief. I have wanted peace. I have prayed for peace. There have been batties. But when the white soldiers win a battle they call it victory.. When the Indians win They call it massacre. Great chief. Will you listen to the words of my chief ? Speak. Move your braves across the little river. My chief too has many soldiers it will They will come and they' will stop on their side. But neither army must strike a blow. While you come to the great white chief for the big Council. I will say yes to this meeting. What is your plan, Sitting Bull ? My Braves will hold their arrows. But your chief must come here. He will meet me between the two armies in the open country. You mean bring the president here ? If this meeting fails, then both armies will come together. The Chiefs in the middle…… will die first. This is the Indian way. My chief is many days travel… I will give him time. Many Braves are here now. More are coming. I will hold them until the full moon I can't promise the president will come here, Sitting Bull. When the moon fills up. He must be here ! Don't bother to unsaddle him, Sam. We're moving on. You aiming to ride all night again, captain ? That's right. I'm plain beat, captain, all out tired.. And besides. rhe horse is ready to quit. You're wrong, Sam. A horse'll run till he drops dead. He'll never quite. Let's go. Come on boy. Come on. Look like every bull footed yankee west of the mississippi. Has move out here. Sergeant ! Yes, sir. See that these horse are walked and fed. Sam, you get something to eat. I'll see you in a minute. it doesn't make sense. It's what Sitting Bull wants. I couldn't change his mind. You can't ask the President of the United States. To come out here and sit under a tree with an Indian. Grant's a soldier. He'll understand. Can you send a message to him right away, sir ? Tonight ? Of course. It's almost hopeless. Maybe, but it could save us a war. All right. I'll have it sent. You get some rest. Thank you, sir. Hey captain ! Hi, glad to see you back. Your fiancee doesn't look any too pleased. Any news ? Will war be declared ? Declared ? It's already on. Charlie's talking to you as a newspaper correspondent. Now you look as if it's been kinda of tough going. Three days nights in a saddle might be tough on a reporter. Here in the army it's just routine. Charlie's no stranger to a uniform He was a major in the last war. A major ? Waht do you know about that. I'm outranked again. You know, under other circumstances I could like him. Any news, captain. No. Nothing. It ain't all bad, captain. We still got a quarter moon to go. The Warriors already, Sitting Bull. [ OGLALA ! ] [ MINNECON ! ] [ ARAPHO ! ] [ SANS ARC ! ] [ YANLTON ! ] [ CHEYENNE ! ] [ HUNKPAPA ! ] [ NORTHERN CHEYENNE ! ] Use said make sure the boar is strong wise chief ? I haven't given the work. The moon is not full. The white man is not watching that moon. He is ready to move. The gold miners more and more come closer. Give me the word to move against these miners. Onc spark will start the prairie burning. Spark ! I will throw a thousand torches. When the time is right. I will light your torches. I'm sure getting band eyed watching that moon, captain. Well I was a fool every think grant would leave Washington. To come out here. Looks like we missed, Sam. That dance they're having might be fun, captain. Yeah, it might be. Sam…… No sense riding a dead horse any longer. You've been a good friend. If you want to put a feather in your hair and go back and join your Indian friends. It's all right. I'll understand. You can leave tonight. I guess I got some of that horse blood you was talking about, captain. You mean you're not giving up ? Good ! Good. Forgive me, captain. But what about you ? Are you gonna give up on her ? Debbie where you turn ? Cathy ? Just what do you want me to do ? I want you to take me away from here. May sure that's what you want ? I know what you're thinking Charlie. I want to marry you. But if you don't take me away from here. I'll go alone. We'll leave together be ready at sunup. I'll be ready. You are a strange man, captain. You fight crazy horse. You are a strange man, captain. You fight crazy horse. You go in the thick of Indian land.. You got no fear in you But you're scared to walk up to one squaw. Grab her by the hair and say. "come to my tent." Hi, Parrish. Glad I ran into you. It was quite a detour you made. Well, I just wanted to say goodbye. I'm leaving for the railhead at daylight. with Cathy. What am I supposed to do wish you good luck ? Well, that's the usual thing. Good luck. Well ? You're doing a stupid thing Are you know it. Is that what you came here for ? You don't love charlie Wenteorth. Let me go. You know you don't. Do I have to call my father. or will you leave ? I'm gonna stop you from leving only way or another. You can't. Belive me You can't. Sir. You wanted in the orderly room, urgent. Yes, sir. It's from him, all right. Here it is, sir. Top secret codes. change them every week. Get rid of them You men wait outside. Sergeant, No one enters into this room. No one you understand. Very well, sir. Well, sir ? Looks like you win. 『 APRROVE PARRISH PLAN 』 『 SET MEETING WITH SITTING BULL 』 『 INSTRUCT FIELD COMMAND 』 『 FULL SECRECY 』 『 SIGNED. U.S. GRANT. PRESDENT. 』 We'd better get busy. Look, sir, see if you approve of this plan. Sergeant. inside. The deals on, sam. You hear fou Sitting Bull. Send word ahead every change you get. And you, sir. I'm going forward with custer. You'll find us. As easy as finding a herd of buffaloes. Come in. Hi Bob. Didn't expect you. So you're really leaving. Yep ! Let's say the second best man has won. I thought your newspapermen lived by a code. Code of honor ? You got that wrong. But if you think I've taken dishonorable advantage of you over Cathy. We can settle that one too. Let's skip that. Something else I had in mind. What about a newspaper man never running out on a story ? What's story ? The biggest story you've ever had a chance to cover. Are you serious ? President grant's a coming out here. Grant ! To sit under a tree and all the council for peace with Sitting Bull. So that's it. You're forgetting, Parrish. I could telegraph that story in without interrupting a single plan for the wsdding. Yes, you could. But that informations top military secret ! Telegraph it and you'll see me put against a wall in front of a firing squad. Do what you think's better. Oh great spirit. Now I come to ask for strength. The war plane is ready. Give us strength and courage If the battle must come…… It will be the last……fight. Your orders, Colonel . Sealed, sir ? Sealed. You may move out when ready. Very good, sir. Forward. Scouts out ! Forward. Troop . Forward. Forward. Ho ! Forward. Troop ! Left ! Column right ! Ho ! Troop ! Left ! Column right up ! Ho ! Get food and presents for council. There will be no war. No war ! Well, Sam ? Sitting Bull got the word, captain. The hatchet's buried. Fine. But there's another kind of trouble out there, sir. I passed through them miner's camps dozens of them. All of them got guns and they're all on the prowl. Looking for injuns. What 's that for, captain. That's custercalling for his officers. SOLDIER: - [ Prepare to ! Dismount ! ] SOLDIER: - [ Dismount ! ] Mr. Reno, You will proceed to the Little Bighorn You'll hold at medicine creek. You should get a good view of the Sioux camp from that position. Very good, sir. But your orders were to hold here, sir. That'll be enough, captain. Captain Benteen, You'll proceed as rearguard to major Reno. All right gentlemen, move out. Very good, sir. I'd advise you not to move so close, sir. Captain Parrish. Did you read general Howell's orders ? Yes, sir. Then you know those orders transferred you back under my command. You also know more about these miners than anyone else. Therefor I'm giving you an order to clear them out of this immediate area. You'll be responsible for their safety but my place is here ! Captain are you refusing an order ? No, sir. Hey, Bob. Get the troops mounted. Yes, sir. A courier just came up with the mail. There was a letter from Cathy. She asked me to give you this. Would you like to read it ? No. The best man was winning all the time, Bob. I knew it. You thought I was a fool to leave her back there at fort. But it wasn't me riding away from Cathy. It was you. Good luck. You know, gentlemen, I was just thinking. If the Indians should attack, This is not a position I would choose to hold as a civilian, Colonel Custer, might I have a word in this. Naturally. Captain Parrish was certain, sir. That the Indians had no plan to attack. Um…Maybe not. I intend to swing off here. Major Reno will hold at the Little Bighorn. Captain benteen will join him as planned. That forest will be the anvil. We'll cut through the hills, hit the river well above major Reno and his men. We'll be the hammer. The Indians will then be between us. If anything should go wrong. If they should attack. The hammer will strike the anvil and heaven help anything that's in between.

Nor for me. Sitting Bull. That is good to hear. But then why are you now going to kill this man for treason ? This man has always risked his life to bring peace between us. He risked his life when he led my people north. So that there would be no more killings on both sides. For all time the Indian will respect this man. When he left my side I called him 『my son.』 I feared for his return. I remember his last words to me 『The great white chief will understand what I have done.』 He said. Kill him, white chief, and your Nation will destroy a patriotic son. Only to find their mistake too late. But let him live, and throw him, the Indian, and the white man, can sit again in peace Council. To peace. To friendship.
