Shall I close the window? No, no. And this decision, did you take it by yourself? Yes. But you're already 2 months pregnant. Did you want it? Yes. And why you don't want it anymore? Because... Because I live with someone. He's 42 and... I can't explain it in one sentence. I'm going to leave him. And you, how old are you? 39. Did you have children before? Yes, I have a son, 16 years old. With the same partner? No, I was married before. Are you divorced? Yes. We'll do it next week. Right now the intervention takes only 10 minutes. You'll go back home the same day. Yes. Yes, I know. Martin? Didn't you go to work? Are you ill? No, I'm OK. What time is it? Don't know... six. Do you want anything? I'll make you tea. No... Come, sit down. Tell me, how did it go? Well, I think math was OK. I could get a 6, but about physics I'm not sure. Maurice wasn't so lucky. Does it worry you? Worry, no. When will you go? Should be at the end of June. Did you tell your father? Yes, yes. Maurice wants to buy a used car. And who will drive? He has a driving permit, and Nicole too. How are things with Nicole? I think I have a chance. Only, she says... that she doesn't like my character. It's Maurice. Serge called you. At last, he went to Charleroi, and won't be back until tomorrow night. Right. Bye. Serge... Before you left I was expecting a child, but not anymore. If I did that without telling you, it's because... I didn't know how to tell you that I was expecting you too. And that I don't expect you anymore. Tomorrow when you're back, I won't come to your house. I'm asking you, don't come to mine. I'm asking you, don't call me. It's not your trips and the time you're away, what has made a distance between us. Lately, when we're together, that's when I miss you most. Perhaps I never was that much yours, with my job, my son, my life. You told me that we have to love people for what they are, not for what they should be. I thought so too, but you cannot do it, and I'm not good at it either. And now this child had become a silence between us, so I got rid of it, like I'm getting rid of you. I'm trying to write you, please try to understand. What are you doing? Aren't you coming? Yes, yes... just a minute. Did you see Salinas yet? No. Who's that? A new one. Started on Monday. They reduce lower personnel, but hire new managers. With the tickets they give to Francine, you don't know what we went to see yesterday. Well with my mother, a drama of course, she just doesn't want to change her habits, and everybody wants to meddle, my sister started to cry. Ay, it's raining! Wait, I'll ask Mr. Froidemont for an umbrella. George! Hey! What are you doing in this building? Perhaps you know, with all these mergers... there's a problem with services, so they called us here, that's all. Did Martin call you? About the used car for the holidays? Expensive guy... I told you so. And for the rest, how are you? Me? Nothing. It's raining. Yes... Hi there Esther. Ahh... hi! Alright, I have to go. See you! Hi Jerome. Hi. Hi Esther. Ladies, allow us the pleasure of your company. For who is that? For us? Mr. Senaldi offers free drinks because he has won his trial. Right, that's great! What trial? No, no really! Well, I'd like some. I like bubbles. I'll have a coffee, please. I'll have some cakes. Yes, a coffee. Jerome, is your wife here? Yes, she's there. Oh... Gabrielle! So they're going to sell Lafert?'s house. Did Gabrielle tell you? Yes, it's far and is becoming a burden. Excuse me. What are you looking for, Francine? Looking for my money because I have to go. I have a meeting. Oh I need your help, but I'll tell you later. Bye. Did you see that Serge is here? Is he here? In the phone booth. I was cut off! Why did you disconnect? No, I didn't do that! Call the same number again. We came back this morning, so I came... Are you OK? Yes. At last, I came looking for you. Denissio'll drive me crazy, he has the slides... We have an appointment with some guys at 2 PM. I didn't call you, excuse me. Pour me one more? Can I take you out to eat Italian? No, I have no time. Tell me... doesn't Francine's husband work in legal affairs? I don't know. It's that I need him to explain something to me. Is my call on yet? I'm trying... Gabrielle might know. Gabrielle! Lucky you're hungry. Anybody wants to buy a 504? Hey Solanz! It's a '76, with blue carpets. No thanks, mine is doing fine. Do you know how long it took to get back from Charleroi? Why are you shouting? I don't know. This morning we got up early... and then with Denissio I think we... If you came back this morning you had time to see Wilson. Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to ask you. What exactly did you say to Wilson? I didn't say anything. I asked him to see you, that's all. And he told me you could drop by anytime. Very well. And? Well, you know, I'm not the only one. I mean, to get into an office, there are 10 guys wanting the job. What time did you go? Sorry? Well, I didn't make a note of it. You didn't go, Serge. Do you have a light? No. No, I didn't go. It's not a good moment, I get proposals from many people. I'm not going back to designing clothes in a workshop. Damn, I did that for 15 years. Listen, you know it, we're not going to... Your number is ringing! Ah, thank you. Marie, how much? I'm off, I'll go with Jerome. Are you OK? Do you have to stand up? No, I'll sit down. Jack, the coffee. I invited some guys to have dinner with us. Will you cook or would you like me to order it? What do you prefer? That you dine with them without me, that's what I prefer. What's up with you, are you tired? Yes, I'm tired. I wrote you a letter, Serge. To me? Yes. Well, when will I get it? I didn't send it yet. What's in it? See you Marie. Bye. Why didn't you tell me? If I had told you, what would you have done? I'd had... I don't know, I'd had... Listen, I don't know what to say. I feel confused. Did you go to work today? Yes. Would you like another drink? Yes, the same. And you? No, thanks. Did they make you sleep? Yes. You know... What? Nothing, I feel bad... They tell you there's a child. And then suddenly, nothing. It wasn't suddenly. Well... You're the woman. Yes. Leave me the letter. No, it's not a matter of words. You need to... I know, I need to understand. But what do I need to understand? That I don't want to live together with you. Yes, yes... OK. But we could talk a little. No? It's worth it. No. OK, so we finished talking. Yes, see what I mean? So... what will we do? Look, we're in a cafe. You're really tired. And I'm real tired too. now this is important and if we start writing letters... Ah... there's Denisold. Right. Where will you spend the night? At home. But where were you? I was looking for you everywhere. Did you forget it was at 2 PM? No, I didn't forget. You left me notes all over the place. Hi Marie. Hi Michel. Excuse me, but... Go. I searched for an hour. Where did you leave your keys? Don't talk stupid, I told you they were below the chair. But what's up with you? Nothing, my business. The problem is the branches of the corporation are so far apart that for the same salary, working conditions vary. And not only in the X-ray equipment section. Management will only talk on the level of qualifications. We all agree this: the strike will end only when there's an employment guarantee. We do agree on this too. About a requalification program... For whom? For those who were threatened by a merger or a foreign takeover. But that was unofficial. Although we all know about it. We didn't get to discuss everything today. Like the problem of supervisory staff, and the indemnities in the case they are laid off. And a bonus for those who are transferred. Well, I think that's all for today. I remind you that we have another meeting tomorrow after lunch. No more bets. Red pays 3 to 1. 3 red. I'm leaving. Already? Let me pay for it or I'll never ask again. So there! Alright, it's not a problem. Well, let's say it's a present for... you know... For Mother's day? Yes, very good. Wait. Turn around. Good. You gained some weight, right? Didn't Andre tell you? It's me who haven't told him. I know, only 2 kilos... What do you want with Andre, with him, I eat, I drink, It's only a dress for work. That's not the point. Alright, you can take it off. Thank you. Did they let you stay on part time? No. Will you quit? No. I can't quit in the middle of Andre's exhibition. And I like the people there better than in Montparnasse. Except when we have to find rooms for them. They arrive, fill in forms? Ah, that must be Serge. He called before and wanted you to call him back. Yes? Yes, Serge, she just got here... Here she is. No, no please... Yes? Yes. Listen, I'm not always at home. What? Yes, and you? No, no... I'm with Anna and am going to Gabrielle's house. You can do as you like, call Gabrielle... Yes, OK. Alright, so, goodbye. You've been living alone for a month? Yes. Well, I can understand, although... Never mind about me. But I just wonder... No, please don't wonder. Got another man? No. When he calls, I'm at a loss. At times, he thinks it's another man. Then he thinks it's a phase. Oh yes, a 'female phase!' Do people have physical seasons? Apart from your father, I've only loved Andre. But I've had other men. Even at my age... A woman is a woman. Don't imagine... I'm not going to imagine a thing! I'm not going to imagine you, and don't you imagine me. That's all I ask. Is it possible? Yes, it's possible. But, I can't help feeling sad. That's Anna. Yes, yes. I'll be right there. Listen, I can't go back to him just to make you feel better. No. I'm alright. I really am. Will Martin come by before he leaves? Of course. - Hello, how are you? - I'm late, right? I like your perfume. No place to park here. Stop here, I'll get them. - Christian is here. - What does he want? It's none of my business, but when I call and a man answers... and I wanted to talk to you in private. Are you OK? Yes, I'm alright. I signed it. Thanks. Need anything else? No, no. Good. Well, next summer, I'll keep the kids till August 5th and you from then on. Yes, you told me. I'm just confirming it. Where are you going now? Gabrielle's house. Ok, ok. My father is dying... We've been expecting it. You'll go to see him? Yes, I'm leaving tonight. What time is it? I've got to go before they get here. Bye. I'd kiss you, but I have a touch of the flu. Good bye. Call me sometime... when I call I always feel I'm disturbing you. All right. Hi! Is their house far from here? No, a ten minute drive. It's chilly, right? It's good to have a suit on. Yes, but I like it like this. I'll never learn... Yes, yes you will. Try again. You don't know how to breath Let her go... Otherwise, she'll never learn. Charles... That's the sixth one since lunch. So don't say you're trying to quit. Breathe! My legs are out. That's not normal. Lift your head! Let her go, Patrick... Can't you leave them alone? Who asked you? Why pick on me? I'm not. Where's your brother? I don't know. Jean-Pierre, get dressed. Anyway, it's almost five, we're leaving. Marie, we have to go to the grocery store. Do you know the way? Yes! Look... Put it back there. Tell me, which way do I go? Yes, straight then right. There is a path off to the left. Have some, Mr. Couturier. Thanks, thanks. You're not going to fire that thing? Who brought the gun? We did. Jerome, have you seen these guns? No, I usually don't look at those things. Jerome! Yes. Did you see about the fence? Yes, I already spoke to him. Martin, move your car so the others can park. Yes, I will. What about me? Sorry, I forgot. Thanks. Shouldn't your kids sleep with you? I can sleep anywhere. No, if they're with me they will raise hell. Anna! I'm waiting for you. I'll finish it. OK. I'm coming! Where do I put this? In the back room. Martin and his friend won't have much room in the garage. Listen, they'll manage. They have their sleeping bags as well. When are they leaving? I don't know, they keep changing their minds. One of these days. What's wrong Gabrielle? Something I haven't told you. Jerome was notified that he'll be fired. What? The letter came today. But, he's almost relieved, because he was expecting it. That might be why he is selling the house. He started losing interest in his work a year ago. Isn't it nice here? Yes, good. Very good. Well, do you want some? No, no. No mixtures for me. You're lying. No mixer here? Never mind. We'll strain them. Did you put some salt? Yes. Marie, put some yeast while I stir it. Yes. I found some in Langeais. You didn't have to go so far. Thanks, Patrick. Cut it out! I like Patrick, he's very nice. You bet he is. Are you getting married? There you go! Life insurance... I hate that attitude. You'd think I'd asked an indecent question. It's not indecent, just pointless. We live together and all... and do things together. What if those 'things' turn out to be a child? Wait, we haven't gone that far yet. It doesn't matter anyway. Can you say that? Yes... Yet you got married like the others. Yeah I got married, at 19, to a man who ran off with someone else. Not bad, huh? Now he's fed up and wants to come back. Now, I'm the "someone else. " Don't tell me that doesn't cause problems. You mean money? That too... Yes, it does cause problems. You can work nights, lazybones. I do. Well, let's change the subject. But why? I sleep with men when I need the money. I don't mind admitting it. Well, I do mind. Jean-Pierre! Get down from there, it's dangerous. Come inside at once! Right now! Charles! If you sleep with strangers... why not with Christian? They come and go but he would stay. Then why have kids? Cut it out! What are you moralizing about? All day, you talk, people listen, the union committee... life, justice! I have no right to be free! Would you tell anyone that? What I'd say is, that sneaking men in while your children are sleeping, that's not freedom. You make love quietly too! My children or yours it's the same. I'd rather sell it and make money rather than doing it for nothing... For nothing? What do you know about other people's lives? I can see how my husband is. But when I need him, I'm glad he's there. If he left me and the kids, I couldn't take it. We're only trying to say that a woman... A woman! A woman! I'm as much a woman as you are. You think I am... I'm sorry... My wedding gown! You haven't stained yourself? No. My wedding dress... How are our great chefs? Looks delicious. What is it, Francine? Charles! You need to know what was said. Therapy is not necessarily psychoanalysis. In fact, according to the behavior... Did you hear what he said? The sea's influence is called thalassotherapy... It's incredible. And who is this cute friend of Colette? Please, don't get up. Thanks. Take the empties. We'll go inside. These mosquitoes. You're right. What will we play? No, not Ambassadors. No, no.. not Ambassadors. Well then what? Switchover. What's Switchover? Aren't you going to play cards? Leave them alone. What's Switchover? You play a scene, like you are a man, Patrick is a woman, Well, Esther could be a guy who tells his wife... Gabrielle. Where's Gabrielle? I don't know, she'll be back in a moment. What do you want? Playing cards. Over here. Two full decks. Thanks. Jerome! What have you done? He took some pills... Leave me alone! Make him vomit. He swallowed half a tube of Neurovine, what I take in the evening. We must call a doctor. Come on. He needs coffee right away. I'm so thirsty! Isn't Francine's husband crazy? Yes. Were you talking? Yes, yes. Did you call? Yes, he said we did the right thing. He has to drink coffee. He'll sleep anyway, but we have to watch him. Be sure the chassis isn't warped. If the guy has had an accident, it might be off a fraction of an inch. In any case, the price is too high. 420 for a '65! Hi! Hail Marie, full of grace! How are you? You're looking good. Yes, I slept 3 hours and played cards all night. Like to know with whom? No. I met them in the village. Oh, look, there's a fairy behind you. My chocolate! What chocolate? Everybody outside! Let's go. Take him... Whose dog is that? It belongs to Denisold, No, no don't feed it, it's a beggar! Why didn't you tell me they wanted to buy a car? I'm sorry. She didn't tell me about the clutch. Did you look at it? Yes, but the left headlight... What's wrong with it? Good morning. Morning Jerome, how are you? You're here? - Yes, I'm here. - What's wrong with it? It doesn't work. Neither does the horn. I can fix the horn. Got the keys? - Yes. - Well, let's go. Come on, let's go! Not an athletic dog, it resembles Denisold. Sorry about last night. I was drunk... But it's not that simple. Anyway, it was stupid. Yes, it certainly was. God! What crap! Turn off the hand horn! Pull the cable! Crap! Stop! Come on! Pull the red cable next to the battery. I don't know if I should cut the cables. And you, be quiet! Come on, hurry up! Turn it off. Thanks. It hasn't changed, has it? How long has it been? Five years. The last time we had dinner. You come here often? Sometimes. What is it? Are you ill? I'm just fine. But someone else is not well at all. Martin? No, not Martin. Jerome. Oh yes, I know. No, you don't. Yes, I do. He's getting the axe in October, but that was inevitable. Georges. He tried to kill himself. Suicide? Yes, last Sunday. I was there. He swallowed some pills. We did save him, but... And Gabrielle? Gabrielle wants to keep it a secret. Georges, it's important you do something. You're asking me? Yes, I'm asking you. What happened with him? It's the way of the group in which he works, where I work, where you work. They decided on a reshuffle of units, closing down 3 plants, And discharging many employees. And so Jerome... he was great ten years ago, but now... Salinas says he's no longer productive. For the past 3 years his projects have been too old hat, too expensive, not reliable. And what's more, copied from foreign projects. That's the story. You mean you can't help him? It's difficult, I'm not the only one who makes the decisions. I'm not telling you to impose his projects, if they aren't reliable. You don't have to cheat. But can't you find another way? An idea? That he starts working again, one way or another. After all, it's Jerome. He's still got talent. You've said so. He's not a memory. Did you like it? Yes. You're right. I don't know how, but... I'll manage somehow. I'll find a way. - Can you pour me some? - Sure. Martin said you're still with Laurence. He should keep still. Yes, yes I am. You're happy then? Well, she's young. She's not demanding, and neither am I. Oh, sure, if neither one is demanding. But is that your love? Getting back to Jerome... he should be in research, so that... he'll just be giving advice, without having to be original. We could use his experience. I can obtain that for him. I'm sure I can. What's wrong? I thought you hated lentils. Yes, but... Well, let me have them. I love them. What is it? I'm just looking at you. Do you like what you see? Not bad. And Serge, how are his project doing? No more Serge. Oh... Right. I don't want to talk about it right now. Do you mind? Then you're... living... Alone! I'm free! Every time Nicole phones and asks "Is Martin there?" he waves at me and turns as red as a beet. I say "Wait Nicole, I'll go and see. " "No, he went out with Maurice. " She says "Funny, Maurice is with me. " My turn to get a color. He listens in on the line. He's not taking it too hard? He takes everything too hard. So you can't tell the difference. That's what worries me. Uh.. I threw you an ash. What kind of Russian? Never took any of those classes in the end. No. But I gave you money for those classes. Yes. I bought a dress. Look, it was this one. No it was another. I think I drank too much. Shall we go? Will you take me? Yes, yes, I'll bring you home. Buy me some cigarettes? Yes. Where's your car? Over there. George? May I ask you one more thing? You can always try. Take me in your arms. and hold me tight. Tight. Tight. You're expected at home? Yes. Well... So long, 'dear friend'. Now if you'd like to see me again... I'll call you. Very well. You've got lipstick on you... Where were you? What do you want? Answer me. Let me by, Serge. Answer me! Where were you, you slut! Out screwing again? How long has this been going on? Who were you with? Do you think I stupid? Serge! How long have you deceived me? So you left me? - Don't give me this crap. - You're completely drunk! He's insane. Leave her alone. Let go, you idiot! Leave her alone. Shit! Leave him alone! Let's go. Leave them alone. They are drunk. Why did you interfere? Come in. Quiet, Martin is sleeping. Yes, I know. Do you want one? No. Well... I stopped by at 10 pm, Martin didn't know where you were. Anyway, he never knows when I ask. I waited at a bar, I drank... What time is it? 3:30 am. Why didn't you say it was him? That it was him, what? Why do you want it to be because of someone, Serge? I'm not the one who 'wants'. People break up for someone else. You think so? Anyway... I always knew I was a loser. You believed in me though. But I didn't believe in myself. When I began designing on my own, I could have predicted what would happen. Then why did you quit? You ask me that? Marie, don't you realize how demanding you are? No? I had to risk it. I wanted to be somebody, something, To accomplish something. But now, I don't care. That's not true, you do care. You've never really loved me, it's normal. You're wrong. I did love you. That makes it even better. I'll clean you up. No, let me. I'm sorry. But I'm so fed up... I know it's over and yet, I just can face it. Don't worry. I know it's over. It's sunrise, we've got to try to live. I have to go home now and get some sleep. I don't know which way to turn now. You are already so far away. You're much stronger than I. I'm not strong, Serge. I often wish I had your strength. Yeah, I must say I'm fantastic. Got a girlfriend? Now where did I park? You know how our meetings go. They say 'expansion' and mean 'shutdowns'. No more new projects. We'll work with what we've got already. That means, fewer problems, since we know what sells and what doesn't. Well, let's go. We need a man here. If not, we'll get snowed under. Good morning. Let us know as soon as you can. I'll phone tomorrow. Glad I could help you out. Don't be a fool. Come on, get in. Someone has to take that job, preferably you. We get on well, you and I. Hasn't that been lost? No, I don't think so. Georges, tell me, did Marie talk to you? Marie? No. We're all in the same boat, Anyone of us could get the axe. It didn't happen to you. But it could, unless I quit. I even forget I'm waiting. You have your car? Yes, there. Well, see you. See you tomorrow. Have you been waiting long? No, 5 minutes. You're OK? Yes... who'd that? Jerome. Good morning. It's incredible! I've lost four coins. Francine! I've lost four coins. Don't always blame me for broken coffee machines, lack of water or the lunchroom aircon... Who me? Madeleine or you. Also with the issue of pharmacy, and today you don't like the coffee. Today there isn't any coffee. I can't be bothered with such nonsense. Look, I voted for you. Otherwise, why did you take the job? I am not on the committee. You get yourselves elected and then... They are all alike. As soon as they're elected... What do you mean? You've got better thing to discuss at the meetings? What's wrong? The coffee machine. Heard from your son? I got a letter last night. Their car broke down at the border. They're sleeping in a truck. - Here I am. Hello. - Hello! Mind if I cancel dinner? No, why? Jerome brought loads of work home from the office. Oh well, we see you in the bar. Telephone call. Yes? And you? What? Tomorrow? Yes, sure. At your place? OK. Not bad. No, not bad. I had forgotten. I hadn't. At the beginning, I was so mad at you. So was I. I wiped you out of my mind... So did I. You do everything like me? This last year was pretty awful. I didn't know it was last year. I didn't realize. I knew, because I was just horrible. You didn't realize, Georges? You left before I did, much sooner. That was when I took on a new job. It absorbed me too much. It was clear we didn't share much anymore, So I became jealous of everything. I kept repeating "we had little too share anymore". Ideas,, nor boredoms, nor friends, nor Martin. Martin, we shared him. One night, when you were not home, Martin must've been 4 years. Suddenly he had a fever, about 40 degrees, He was in a bad state, choking. I thought he was going to die in my arms. You never told me. I called Gabrielle. She told me to bathe him. She and Jerome came over, they were wonderful! Then you came home, so late, so tired. Such a stranger, ...that I didn't tell you. I'm a bit hungry. Again? Yes, again. What are you doing? Just looking. Laurence lives here all the time? Almost. Since when? Five or six months. You never lived with others? No. Are you going to tell her today? No. She never asks questions? Yes, but you know that I don't answer when I don't want to. Yes, I know that. The toughest questions are the ones I ask myself. Are you coming? Yes. Your brother's haven't changed. Was that in Orleans, at Michel's? Yes. Still in music? Yes, practicing with his daughters now. I liked him. Because he liked me. Everybody liked you. No, not everybody. It's sufficient? Yes. 'Cause that's all I've got. Were you tired of living alone? Yes. I think... You said she was working on a Master's degree? Why is she in Grenoble? She's earning some money, as an interpreter at a convention on psycho... Now, stop talking about her. But who started it? I'm sorry, I didn't realize. That's it. Where do you see him? At his place... at mine when she's there. Or at a hotel. Often? Now yes. Not all that often. I wish it were more often. Have you seen Serge since? Once, at the Italian place. A bit remote, but very relaxed. He's not drinking anymore. Not a drop. That's because of Anna. Who's Anna? I think he wants to impress her. He looks for her and drives her kids to school. I do not know, but... Get in the car or you'll get drenched. You tell me that now, when I'm already soaked? A truck, watch out! Let's go! Let's go, hurry up! - This is exasperating me. - Well, hurry up. Marie... wake up. What time is it? 7:15 am Thanks. When does she arrive? Her train gets in at 7.30 am. Crap! Your bracelets. Yes, thanks. Wait, I'll help. No, no... Pull it a little bit. I am pulling it! But why make your bed? Where will you say you slept? Yes. This can't go on. I'll talk to her. How is Jerome doing? He won't say a word. Is he working? No, he isn't. Why? I don't understand. What do you mean "he isn't"? I can't help him anymore. He's going to be fired, for good. Listen, I gave him a job. The only one around. Then he brought me documentation, saying that it wasn't worth writing a report. That did not work. Not what I wanted to tell you. Then I gave him another job. We again waited two weeks. He didn't show up to the meeting. He promised us 20 pages, but only gave us 10, a botched job and late. Who read it? I did. That was enough. It's not possible. Yes, it is. I don't believe it. He can't even see himself the way you see him. I don't know what he's up to. He doesn't want anything anymore. He's finished, Marie. Finished? You talk like that now? Marie, I know he's your friend. He's your friend too. Yes, but not theirs. I can't do any more favors for him. He's no longer productive, is that it? "Everyone should have a chance", you used to say that. Perhaps. I'm going. Don't be afraid. Afraid of what? You know I never agreed with Georges. Not even before. But in this, frankly... What's more, Jerome, leaving aside our feelings... - Would you like pineapple? - No. When I think of the 114 manufacturing... 110 or 114 I cannot remember... Some sent to the province, separated from their families. Others simply fired into the street. Without time, without second chance, without Georges' aid or anyone else's. The truth is I can't feel much pity for Jerome. Many pilgrims come to Mecca, festivities occur without disturbance. Although there's a chance that unruly groups divert attention. So police and army have set up checkpoints throughout the area. From early morning visits are going on... Yes? Yes, Gabrielle... No, no... I'm trying to write to Martin. How? Wait, wait. Yes, yes... How? When did he tell you? When you got home? Oh I'm so glad! I bet you are too... Oh, crap... No, I dropped my cigarette. I'm a little tipsy, tell him I'm glad for him. Will you tell him from me? Don't forget. Kisses for you! And kiss him from me. See you tomorrow. No, no. I'm fine. See you tomorrow. Hi, excuse me. May I speak to Georges? It's Marie. Hi, am I interrupting? I wanted you to know right away that someone else has saved Jerome. Salinas, you told me about him once. He'll be in the achieve room. It's less pay, but it's enough. If he accepts, that's fine. I didn't know he'd like being in a cupboard. If he's glad, you're glad, and we're all glad. Is that all? Yes, you already told me that. Next time, I'll choose the film. Esther's a big help, she reads all the subtitles aloud! Because Jacques can't see them. Can I take you with me? Where are we going? To the Italian place. Yes. Somebody saw him jump from the 3rd floor. Stand back. Stand back. There's still room in this box. There's this too... Are you hungry? Yes, yes I am. Well, I have to go now. I'll carry them down. No. They'll be picked up. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thanks. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Gabrielle... For years it didn't occur to me... It happened very gradually. When did you notice? I was surprised, but not much. I think I'd already guessed. He didn't have many, did he? I don't know what you call 'many'. Some of them I probably never saw. Sometimes he mentioned them. He never talked about "women". He would say "I met someone", "you might have seen". It wasn't that I didn't care. I know. With him and me, it never worked, hardly ever that is. It was love much more than sex. So I couldn't keep him from looking elsewhere. Did you tell him about your affair with Paul? No, if I had, we would have separated. Remember that summer, he was so funny? When he went to pick up Georges. And he took that police car. All the trouble that caused. During the last weeks in the office, he kept his shutters closed all day. I have to get away from here. Come and live with me. Yes. I have to sell the house. I need money to make a new start. You'll have to see Georges, you know. You have to tell him, none of us could have prevented it. Over here, please. There's the fence. The property reaches the bushes there. And those trees there. All of them. Well we... You couldn't be in better health for it. You're in great shape. I'm glad to hear that. You're sure this time? Yes, I'm sure. I'm pregnant. For what date? For April. So it will be Aries. You have a call. Ah, it's the buyer of the house, it's not even fixed. Is it sold? No, not yet. We're working on it. And does Georges know? No. But this time, I'm keeping it. I wanted it so badly. I really don't know what Georges wants. What is it? Nothing. You just make me laugh. I make myself laugh too. I can't have a child and a man at the same time. And as time passes, it seems less important. To have a child is a serious matter, for it and for me. When I say "I'm keeping it", I wonder if it's keeping me. Otherwise... I don't know, I really don't know what to do with my life. I get knocks, I'm clumsy. Fate, fate doesn't exist. Liberty does. I'm not talking about Jerome's liberty, he wasn't free to start with. I'm talking about ours, we haven't done too much to attain it. I, at least. Does Gabrielle live with you? Yes, we found a place on rue Saint Antoine with a room for us, and for Martin as well, if he wants. He'll be back soon. I won't be here when he gets back. I'll be in Marseilles on a personal affair for two months. Maybe longer. A trial run. With some men my age and 3 younger ones. If all goes well, we'll work together. I can't go on here. Not anymore. Laurence is coming with me. She's giving everything up. You know Laurence, it's hard to say this, but she was and is... I have the car right here. Can I bring you someplace? No, I prefer walking. When are you leaving? Day after tomorrow. See you. See you. She didn't tell him? She wasn't going to. She saw she has no place in his life. But someday he'll find out she had a child. And he'll ask questions. She said he wouldn't ask questions. Even so, that couldn't change anything. But how will the child grow up with only her? Her and me. No dear, don't be silly. You'll be staying until when? The end of the summer. I have to be out by September 1. Then this is our last time here. Yes, it's the last time.
