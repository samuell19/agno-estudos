April 9th, on our wedding day, Denmark was occupied by Germany. PROCLAMATION! To the Danes. To save the factory, Karl had to cooperate with the Germans. TRAITOR Our family has drifted apart. Michael joined the Free Corps on the Eastern front. He returned home physically and mentally scarred. Helene became infatuated with a German submarine captain, and ran off with him to Norway. When he died at sea, she returned home to us. Both Knud and Valdemar have become obsessed with jazz music. Aksel rallied against the government. And following Svend's death, he has fallen into bad company. Karl found a weapon that Aksel had hidden in the attic. They had a terrible fight. Karl banned Aksel from our home. OUT OF THE DARKNESS February 1943. - It's only for a couple of days. - Are you wanted? No. Officially, I still live at home. They haven't come by since they shot Svend. - But you think it might happen? - I don't know. I won't get you involved. We'll always do our best to help you. I know. - Are you speaking on my behalf? - I know your attitude. - Britta's in a pamphlet group. - I'm not saying yes to everything. - I'd like to know beforehand. - Clear speech. - I like that. - Of course you can live here. Thanks. I met Michael in Kgbmagergade the other day. He was drunk as a skunk. - Did you talk with him? - No. He was way too drunk for that. - I felt so sorry for him. - That bastard. - Aren't you tired of licking stamps? - Yes. You need to get back into the game. You're not usually so apathetic. Join our Corps. You owe it to Schalburg and all your fallen friends. - Louise? One more round, please. - I don't fight civilians. Not civilians. Cowards who won't put on a uniform. I'm an officer, not the police. The Schalburg Corps is not for me. As their interrogation officer I know we lack good men. You'd fit right in. - No, thanks. - You're bloody impossible. - Michael Skov, right? - Yes. I'm Aage Thorup's wife, Louise. Aage, your father's driver. We met several times in Vedbak. - I'm sorry, I don't remember. - I see. - How could anyone forget Louise? - I don't understand it. - I'm sorry. - No problem. Your half-brother Aksel... Do you ever see him? - No. Why? - I got this photo from the police. It was taken recently. He's talking to a Spain volunteer. Bloody fool. It won't be long before we catch him. - Cheers. - Cheers. The Germans guard the more sensitive section of the factory. The rest we look after ourselves. The Justice Department wants all major companies to set up effective defence measures. What we do ourselves doesn't interest the saboteurs. They destroy all the factories they want to. The Minister of Justice demands that we fight back against the terrorists. Yes, but we're afraid that this will worry our workers. Right, Kurt? It's important that we avoid types like the guards of the German section. We've already had a couple of incidents. Sorry about the interruption. I have an important message. Michael, wait until this meeting is finished. - It's important, Karl. - Please give Michael some water. Of course. Come here. I'm sorry. Michael had some terrible experiences at the Eastern front. Yes. This war... Poor boy. - Goodbye. Give my regards to Eva. - T will. I'm so sorry that I couldn't prevent your son from barging in. Michael. Michael? Michael! Michael, why did you come barging in like that? - You have to warn Aksel. - What did you say? Michael, hey! Look at me. - What are you saying? - You have to warn Aksel. What have you heard? Get him the hell away before the Gestapo gets hold of him. Do you understand? The Gestapo? I've no idea where he is. Hello. It's the police. We're looking for Aksel Skov. - He doesn't live here anymore. - We have a warrant. - I'll call Mrs Skov. - Svendsen, search the attic. - Should I call Mrs Skov? - Jorgensen, the cellar. Hello. Excuse me, who are you? Sergeant Mortensen. We have a warrant for Aksel Skov. - He isn't here. - Do you know where he is? I think he's on a bike tour with some friends. - Whereabouts? - In Jutland. We haven't heard from him lately. What's this all about? I can't say. But it would be best if he turned himself in. I assume you understand that it's an offense to hide a wanted person. Why not look in the dustbin? That would be right up your alley. - Do you think this is just a game? - Are you finished, Jgrgensen? - Yes. He's not in the cellar. - We have to go. - Thank you for visiting. - Don't be so cocky. We haven't forgotten that your son shot one of us. Excuse me. I'm here to see Britta. - I'm Britta. - I see. I'm Karl Skov. Knud's father. I have to see him right away. Do you know where he is? He's playing on the radio right now. But he's playing here tonight. - I can give him a message. - Well... It's regarding Aksel. Knud's brother. I was hoping Knud could establish contact for me. - Do you know where Aksel is? - No idea. No... Knud finishes at four. Perhaps he knows something. Thank you so much. Please come and visit us with Knud some day. It would be so nice. Dad? - I'll see you next Thursday. - Of course. - What's the matter? - Can you get in touch with Aksel? The Gestapo are after him. The police came to our house. I think he sleeps in a new place every night. I know someone who can tell him. Tell him to get to Sweden as quickly as possible. We'll cover the expenses. Give him this to start with. - I'll do what I can. - You're not in this mess, too? No! You know I'm not cut out for it. Yes, of course. We have to come and hear you play at Stardust. I don't think our music is really for you and Mum. Say what you want to him. I'm not fleeing. They know who you are. They'll catch you soon. We're better than you think. The Nazis are drawing back all over. - They've lost momentum. - These are from Dad. Don't worry so much. - How is Britta? - I think I love her. - You ought to find a girlfriend, too. - I'm working on it. - Someone I know? - No. It's an underground love. We're sure he ratted on Erling and the group. It's open season. - I'll take the assignment. - He's always armed. - I'll cover you. - It ought to be me. I cycle fast. It's important when clearing out. Let us handle this, Oluf. You've been a heavy smoker all your life. I don't like it. As head of the group it's my job to take him out. The boys are right. You're not in any shape for this. I have a report on his daily activities. His name's Henning Langaa. He has no set routines. This is where he meets people. May 1943. - Hello. May I take your order? - Three beers. Henning Langaa. They shot him! - It's not him. - What? It's not him! He's here! Go! Finn. He looked so much like Langaa. - He... - It could've happened to any of us. It was a horrendous accident. It was. I have killed... an innocent man. It was an accident. It was. Look at me. There's a letter from the registry office. Your surname's Skov again. Helene. Are you going to lie there all day? Dad and I understand that all of this hasn't been easy for you. But you have to move on in life. We all do. No matter what happens. All my friends have turned their backs on me. If I go out, I always risk someone recognizing me, shouting "jerrybag". Dad and I thought that you could start at the factory's design department. Mum? No dinner for me tonight. I have a jam session at Stardust. No way. You have a physics report to write and then it's off to bed. - You can go to the club Saturday. - The jam session is only on tonight. All your teachers complained that you're getting lazy and sloppy. - No more music at night. - It's not fair. Close the door behind you. You're grounded! Goodbye, gentlemen. I hope my advice was worth the travel. Definitely, Doctor Koch. We're extremely grateful. Goodbye. He probably thinks you've wasted his time. He seemed satisfied. He was disappointed that you weren't more specific. There are many good reasons to want to think this through. We're not in the same political situation as you. You've only done business with the Germans. - Why not extend the collaboration? - Everything's changing so fast now. I see. SO now Sweden wishes to be properly neutral? We are incredibly grateful for all your help, brother-in-law. Give my regards to the family. We'll get back to you. Safe travels. - Did you pump him? - Yes. Thanks for the tip. - Did you get your pay? - Yes. He refused for a while, but then names and addresses just flowed out of him. His Mum won't be able to recognize him. - I want to see. - Good idea. Thanks. Splendid. One more game? Michael, you want in? I'm tired of listening to your bullshit. Your friend is prudish. Don't say that about a man who was awarded the Iron Cross. Can I play? You have rationing stamps, but I have French silk stockings. Please sit down. Louise? One more round. - Do you have any more? - Maybe. Thanks, Louise. - Oh! Are those for me? - Yes. If you go upstairs with me, I'll put them on you. I'm sure they will suit you. - Forget it. - Where did you learn Danish? Danish girls have big teaching talents. And they say Germans don't have a sense of humour. Cheers! - Why are you up? - Do you know the time? I had a table that wouldn't leave. I called the inn. No one answered. - It was too noisy. - The phone is in the bar. - Why so suspicious? - I called four times. No wonder that... Are you calling me a liar? I just told you it was noisy and busy. - Of course I worry when... - Worry? You think I cheat on you. - But I... I didn't say that. - You think I'm a whore now? No, of course not. I got this because of the long hours. Here. I think you need a glass. And so do I. - Let's take them to bed. - Not tonight, honey. I'm exhausted. And suddenly he's 18. No children in the house anymore. You'll be graduating next summer. We need to discuss your further studies. I won't be studying and I won't graduate. What's this nonsense? You have to go now or you'll be late. - I'm not going to school. - Are you off? - I'm done with that institution. - What's this notion? If you won't study, what will you do instead? - Do you want to be an apprentice? - Don't act up. Mind your own business. I won't swot for the rest of my life. - I'm tired of being mocked at school. - What do you mean? Everyone knows you collaborate with the Germans. - Why haven't you told us? - What good would it do? I won't stand for it. I'll speak with the headmaster. We don't need all these comforts, Karl. I could start working again. Can't you sell your shares in the factory and get out? I had hoped for your support. The way the wind's blowing, we risk being totally isolated. - I doubt it. - I met Mrs Troense in Illum. - She pretended she didn't know me. - She's a gossip. When has Mrs Troense ever done something for other people? I can't just run away. If no one takes responsibility for our companies, there's no society. - You're so uncompromising. - I'm not! - You don't understand this company. - Nobody understands what we're doing. Find some decent friends who do. We do it for the good of all. - It's causing the boys to drift away. - And who's causing them to drift? - You're no help! - You don't mean that. Don't touch me! I've never seen him like that before. He'll come round again. Dad's trying to keep up appearances. I see it every day at the factory. We have to be kind to him, Mum. I wish he would make up with the boys. It'll be all right. They love him. I miss them terribly. The town hall square was rowdy yesterday. - The cops made over 100 arrests. - It's even worse in the towns. People can't be controlled anymore. They don't like your executions. We'll put a stop to that soon. Genuine Sumatra. - Genuine St ink adores from Svendborg. - That was just a test. Here's the real McCoy. Directly from Holland with band and all. - I'll take them. - Arne. The police. Your hat! Hello. Arne Nordborg usually comes here. - Arne who? - Nordborg. - We have so many customers here. - Yes. - He got away. - Goodbye. - One more round, please. - Yes. - What did you just say? - You'll soon see for yourself. Don't give me all that secrecy. Doctor Best just returned from Berlin. Hitler's furious that the police can't put a stop to the sabotage. They'll put a ban on strikes. Special military court. - Death penalty for saboteurs. - And if the government refuses? Then they'll declare a military state of emergency. The Wehrmacht can't disarm the army with their pathetic recruits. An armoured division is on its way from Norway. Real Front bastards. We'll find them in bed. - Who? - You, my darling. You'd like that. We'll show the terrorists what real war is all about. You're adding fuel to the fire. ANNOUNCEMENT MILITARY STATE OF EMERGENCY Everything was fine. Was it really necessary for the government to leave? Yes, when the Germans introduced the death penalty. It's very unfortunate. But Christmas Mgller in London and all the Commies are also to blame. They sabotage our politics. We must maintain some societal control and avoid further German intervention. - It doesn't sound very stable. - Your company has better conditions. - You won't have any big problems. - I hope not. But I'm not sure. Do any of you know the Council of National Liberation? Yes! I'm sure they're planning a Communist coup d'état. They won't get far with that. No matter what you think of them, we should keep an eye on them. The people might see them as powerful. I doubt it. - Have you heard from Aksel? - Not a word. In this unfortunate situation, it might be better this way. - Eva wants me to sell the factory. - You're not going to, are you? No, but... I'm starting to feel more and more alone in this. - Maybe she's right. - She has no business sense. You created it all from scratch. Don't waver now. October 1943. - Is Mrs Meyer in there? - Yes, her and her grandchild. I tried to save some of her belongings from her apartment. But the Germans had already razed it. - Let's go in. - I haven't told her yet. She's rather upset. Thank you for coming, Mr Skov. I didn't know who else to contact. We can't afford the boat to Sweden. But I I have some jewelry that you might help us sell. - Don't think ill of us. - Sarah, keep your jewelry. It was my aunt's. It's a genuine brilliant. - Your daughter might like it. - Out of the question. Subject closed. I'll pay for the boat. How are you going to get over? Do you have any contacts? - Mr Hansen has been asking around. - I talked with a fisherman. - He's demanding 10,000 kroner. - Pure extortion. - It's a year's salary. - Another one might accept 5,000. This shouldn't stop us. How soon can they get over? Very soon, I hope. Come to my office tomorrow. I'll go to the bank as soon as they open. Please tell me if you need anything. My wife and I want to help, Sarah. We, of course, consider it a loan. If we can ever repay you... No. Subject closed. Give this to my sister. She'll do all she can to help you. This is for the first weeks. Without your help, we would be lost. Yes. They're here. - Thank you. - Good luck, Sarah. - Safe travels. - Thank you. Now we can only hope. You've handled this well, Karl. - Do you know how Louise is behaving? - What are you talking about? - Does she have a driver's license? - No. I saw her behind the wheel of a car with a German officer. - It can't have been her. - They drove right past me. - Are you sure? - What if Mrs Skov saw her. You can't put up with it! No. - What are you doing? - You deserve it. - What do you mean? - Driving with a German officer! - It could cost me my job. - Where did you hear that? Annelise saw you. But, Aage, he offered me free driving lessons. A driving license is so expensive. That's all there is to it. Darling. - It mustn't happen again. - I'm sorry. It won't. But don't hit me. Okay? I can't stand it. Good evening. I have this for you. - Hi, Finn. - Leif. - Are you happy? - Very. They're coming. - Have you met them before? - I heard they can be trusted. - Aksel? - My name is Finn. I see. And you're the leader of the group? - Yes. - I have torches for you. I have a map of the posts in my car. - Finn's brother is in the Free Corps. - IT know. It's none of my business. I'm happy your group is helping us. - We want our share of the weapons. - Higher authorities will decide. - Then you can do it yourself. - Stop. You can't be serious? If we don't get our share, we're not with you. Obviously. Okay, I give in. But under protest. I'll take the parachute. Now. - Stop. - And again. - See you later. - See youl. - I took that fool for a ride. - You'll get into trouble. We need the weapons. The others don't do shit. Do you know what they call themselves? The Waiting Group! Bloody hell! Step on it. We'll shoot our way through. Bloody good driving, Finn! Oluf! Oluf! Turn around! Goddamn it! Will you please get Annelise so we can clink glasses? - We should go ice-skating tomorrow. - I have a pair you can borrow. - I haven't skated for years. - I'll hold your hand. Who is the lovely young lady? It's Britta. Knud's girlfriend. You just said hello to her. I know, but... Why is she here? Because she's with Knud. She's with Knud? How amusing. Did you hear that, Georg? - She's with Knud. - Yes, darling. - Why weren't we at the wedding? - They're not married. Knud and Britta are a couple. - But then who's Britta? - That's me. Now I think... we should all raise our glasses to Britta. Good idea, Dad. And wish each other a merry Christmas. Let's hope this is our last Christmas with the Germans here. I wish you a very merry... Britta. O Christmas tree o Christmas tree how lovely are thy branches. - Yes. - Cheers! Heil Hitler. - That is your headache. Cheers. - Merry Christmas. - Did you get the pigs that shot Gaust? - Not yet. I demand a danger bonus. Don't be greedy, little Arne. Remember you're fighting for a great cause. Merry Christmas. What would you like? A bottle of schnapps. - Have you seen your family? - No, I'm not welcome. Neither am I. Suits me just fine. - Hi, Louise. - You're a cheeky bastard. - Merry Christmas, darling. - Thank you. Is it okay? - It looks all right. - Thank you. - Mr Petersen is here. - Very well. Okay. - Good evening. - Liva. - How's the rest of the group? - They're safe. - How will we manage without Oluf? - We'll reorganize the groups. - We have several new recruits. - But they have no experience. The plan is that you will lead one of the groups, Finn. - Can I choose my own people? - Within limits. We have to listen to the Council of Liberation, they're coordinating. Who put them in charge? We're not fighting for the capitalists. We have to work with all the parties involved. But they don't trust us. They won't give us weapon and explosives. The party has two representatives on the council. If we keep pushing, they'll give in eventually. They're leading us by the nose. We have the contact to the work places so they can't avoid us. What do you say? Will you take the job? Yes. But I want Leif in my group. Good. I'll keep you informed. I have to go. When is Oluf's funeral? The funeral has taken place. In silence. - Why wasn't I told? - For good reason. - Talk to you soon. Red Front. - Red Christmas. Yes, Red Christmas. I almost forgot. - Merry Christmas from the party. - Thanks. - And a little something. - Grand. We'll stay in touch. You can have the bedroom tonight. I'll sleep on the couch. Thanks so much, Ellinor. A nice Christmas present. Hurry up! The Germans are in the street! - They're here. - We have to go to the roof. Now. Get back to bed. February 1944. Here. And you get this. There's not a soul around. Now the fun begins. - But tidy it all up afterwards. - Of course. We're off as soon as we've tested it. Don't tell me any more than necessary. I guess you heard the Germans executed five of our comrades in Aalborg. Yes. And the bastards just sent 31 people to Germany. No one lifted a finger to help them. Thank you, Lorentzen. It's ready. Damn it! Let me have a look at it. Thanks. I think it's working now. That's it. You understand that from here on in you'll be on the run? But there's still time to get out. Next week it's serious. - How many times shall I say it, Aksel? - My name's Finn! And you are Ole. Please remember. No one would blame you if you find it too hard. If you get caught... then it's the end. - Let's go. - Yes. Are you coming? The Germans are too close. Mission abort. - Toss the bikes onto the platform. - Come on, lads. Come on now. We have to find the pilot before they do. Is he dead? No. - They have patrols on both sides. - We have to move him now. - Grab him. - We won't make it. When they find the parachute, we're dead. - Maybe we can use the dinghy. - Get it. We'll carry him to the bank. Leif, now! Goddamn it. Valdemar! Get under the bridge. Let's move on. - What should we do? - Could we hide him at home? - What do you mean? - In the cellar. - I'm sure Annelise will help us. - Let's go. Aksell. We have an injured Englishman. His plane was shot down. - An injured Englishman? Here? - Can you help us? Lie him down on the table. Careful. Valdemar, call this number. Say "Finn says the water broke." I'll keep guard. Goddamn it. 36-14. The water broke. Okay. When is he back? I'll call again. Goodbye. Valdemar. What's going on? - Is it Aksel? - Yes, or... Don't go down there! We have to... get under. - Aksel. - What in the world's going on? - An English pilot. We found him. - Hand me your belt, Aksel. - Annelise, take a ladle. - Yes. Here. This was in the nick of time. Why didn't you call me? - We'll move him as soon as possible. - It's far too risky to move him now. - So he should stay here? - We can't admit him. - The Germans would find out. - Dad'll never allow it. He will have to. It's best not to get him involved just yet. - Is the doctor coming? - He's not at home. - We can call again in an hour. - Put him in the room in the attic. Give him some water when he wakes up. - I'll stay until the doctor arrives. - I'll come back when Dad's at work. We'll talk later. So you've involved Valdemar in whatever it is you're doing? I tried to dissuade him. He kept pushing me. - He's only a child. - He was so determined. Now at least I can keep an eye on him. I have to go before Dad wakes up. Thank you, Mum. I'm so proud of you. Please be careful, Aksel. - We'll try to get him to Sweden. - IT wouldn't recommend it. The wound could open up and his bandages need changing. I'm a trained nurse. Here's some morphine. If his temperature rises, contact me immediately. Thank you. Eva? It's your call, Eva. You're so distant. Is something the matter? I have to tell you that I'm hiding an English pilot in the attic. No. Tell me you haven't. He's wounded and I promised to tend to him on the boat to Sweden. What's this nonsense? If he isn't operated on soon, he won't make it. Is it Aksel who's involved you in this madness? You risk your life! We have the death penalty now. - He has to pick him up right now. - It's my decision. I can't just fold my arms when the boys need help. - The boys? - Valdemar's also involved. No! No, now we... We need to remain calm. Can't you hear how completely mad all of this sounds? You're risking your life for a total stranger. I can't say no when I'm needed. It's as simple as that, Karl. - I need you. Doesn't that count? - It's not always about you. Helene! Helene? Don't take it so hard. - I have to do this. - But why didn't you tell me sooner? - It only just happened this morning. - Valdemar and Aksel already know. - Apparently, you don't trust me. - Of course I do, Helene. Mrs Skov is hiding an injured English pilot in the attic. What? - No way. - I shouldn't be telling you. You're only telling me. - A doctor came... - Doctor Madsen? No, that's the strange bit. A total stranger. - And Mrs Skov seems well enough. - Are you sure it's an English pilot? Director Skov is not pleased, I can tell you. I'm surprised Mrs Skov would do such a thing. Ouch. Your elbow, honey. - You're so clumsy. - I'm sorry, darling. Do you think Annelise knows something? - I think so. But she won't tell me. - That's just like her. Ouch. That's your elbow again. You forgot to turn off the light in the passage. Goodbye, Karl. We have to go now. There was a lot of shooting on Friday. I thought it was an air raid. The bloody English on a dropping operation. For once we hit a plane. - Did you find any survivors? - It caught fire and crashed. - Why do you ask? - No particular reason. - Do you need to tell me something? - No, Aage made a comment. - About Aksel Skov? - No. You don't owe that family anything, the way they've treated you. We can't afford for Aage to lose his job. - We can find a solution for that. - I'm not an informer. Don't worry. It'll stay between us. Go! Upstairs! - No one's here. - Go down. - And? - We didn't find him. False tip-off. What's going on here? Who's in charge? Good morning, Mr Skov. Inspector Schimmel. We've been told that you're hiding an English pilot in your attic. - And did you find him? - No. Not yet. How strange. Are you not aware that my factory produces goods for the Wehrmacht? - I don't know anything about that. - There's a lot you don't know. Ask Doctor Koch. I work with him. - We're following orders. - Ask Doctor Koch and leave my house. - Goodbye, Mr Skov. - Idiot. Everybody out! June 1944. - How's your wife? - She's well, thank you. The Allies are gaining a foothold in France. She'll be back home soon. Well... Let's hope so. It's time for you to reconsider your position, too. My position? Do you really think the Germans would let me halt production? Well, you've got a problem there. I can see that. It's not just my problem. I have the government's full consent. True. But those were different times. The day of reckoning will come. Perhaps it would be wise for you to already now do something to show your good intentions. You're talking nonsense. My hands are completely tied. What do you think I could do? Some major companies working for the Wehrmacht have discreetly supported the Resistance with large sums. So, you're saying I should support sabotage and terrorism? Now that it's clear that Germany won't win the war. More and more people take a different view now. This is blackmail. More politicians now show regard for the Council of National Liberation. They're in regular contact. If you wait for too long, things could turn unpleasant. Would you... be able to establish contact if I decided to give a donation or whatever you call it? - It could be arranged. - And there are no guarantees, right? Or a good, old-fashioned receipt? Hardly. But if the money goes through the right channels, it will be noticed. - Did you hear that Knud proposed? - No! Congratulations, Britta. - Thanks. - He finally plucked up the courage. - You're not pregnant, are you? - No. Fortunately not. - When is the wedding? - We've decided to wait. Until the Germans have been kicked out. - Hi, chicks. - Hi, handsome. The young ladies have bought you a drink. - You're a real charmer. - He breaks hearts all over. - You're really swinging. - I don't think that's the reason. - Which one will it be tonight? - I'll put them to the test. Cheers. - You play so well. - Thanks. I have to be prepared when the real American jazz musicians arrive. It won't be long. They've reached Paris. - Really? - Yes. Didn't you know? The BBC said so last night. We'll soon be hearing wedding bells. I'm way too late. - When will I see you again? - I don't know. - Let's set a date. - No. - We can't go on like this. - What do you mean? - It's too risky. - It's worth the risk. It's irresponsible. We're both key figures. We can't do this. I can't live without you. We have to see each other once in a while. You're a romantic fool. Hello, Director Skov. - Hello, Holm. It's been a while. - Yes. - You are my appointment, right? - Yes. Let's get right to it. Put your briefcase under the table next to mine. I hope you can put in a good word for me in the right places. - What do you mean? - I was forced into this situation. So I should report that you regret your collaboration with the Wehrmacht? My patriotism has never been questioned. Maybe you should have shown it a bit earlier on. Make sure that Aksel and Valdemar get over here. - I tried to do so many months ago. - You have to try again. Eva. I miss you so much. It's empty without you. Do you know if I'm on the wanted list? Not in Denmark, anyway. Not according to Eskebjerg. But the Gestapo are calling the shots now. - How is Helene? - The design department loves her. - She's my only consolation. - Are you coming? - Kalle's here. Dinner's on the table. - We're coming. The Allies are advancing fast. You'll soon have your beloved Eva home again. - Let's hope so. - A toast to her safe return. Cheers. - How is the factory doing? - We're keeping busy for the moment. But things could change overnight. We're heading for difficult times. You'll have to adapt the company. You're usually good at that. It's not that simple. Denmark is still occupied. I'm tied to contracts I can't get out of. It's not like here. You change sides with the wind. Gustav's not to blame for the pickle you're in. That's one way of putting it. You make it sound so cheerful. - Let's have a toast for the pickle. - Be kind to Karl. It's not easy. What's the point of this strike? The Germans will tighten their grip even further, and it will be impossible to rule this country. The workers have left everything in order. My job is done. When you impose a curfew so people can't get groceries, you're asking for trouble. The Germans start executing people and the Schalburg Corps have free rein. Dad! People are barricading the streets. The Germans are shooting. There are several dead and wounded. - Where did you hear this? - Britta just called. - The Germans cut off water and gas. - Why do the police accept this? They're tired of being the Germans' errand boys. If the police don't do their job, the Germans'll take over. Then it'll be like Norway. You tried that. Is that what we want? - Of course not. - Then use your head. Death to all Germans! Valdemar! Are you crazy? - Valdemar! - Come and join us. - The police have given up. - Stop it! Come with us. Treacherous rat! Filthy bastard! The Krauts are coming! - Come with us! - I'm going. - It's too dangerous! - I'll be fine. See you. At least we can be grateful that the Germans have made concessions so people can work again. Only after the Council of National Liberation agreed. Now those charlatans set the agenda. - Unfortunately. - Why do our politicians allow it? The way things are going, they don't have any choice. Now I can't get home for lunch. I'll take it out on your Madeira. You're welcome. Stay here. We're too old to go to a shelter. Nothing happens. Get them to stop all that racket! Thank you. That's better. - Who's your guest? - It's Karl, my dear. Hello, Granny. How are you? Thank you for asking. Feeble. - And who are you? - Karl. - I'm Karl. - Karl is our son-in-law. - He's married to Eva. - Eva. Where's Eva? She's taking a short holiday, staying with Agnes in Sweden. She married a Swede. - Isn't he a homosexual? - No, he's an engineer. Yes, I know that. That's why they can't have children. Oh no! That's so incredibly rude! Do something, Georg! Hello. We have to talk to Director Skov. - He's not at home. - Could he lend us civilian clothes? The Germans are arresting all police officers. It's too risky to go home. I'm sorry. Eskebjerg. Chief Constable. I studied with Karl Skov. And this is Sergeant Mortensen. - We know him here. - Can we go inside, please? Perhaps we could borrow some clothes. We'll return them, of course. Come this way. I can't lend you Mr Skov's clothes. You can borrow some of my late son's. Thank you so much. I'd feel more at home in one of Karl's suits. I was afraid she wouldn't help us. When we reach the bus station, let's cut through the forest. - This is affecting my blood pressure. - I have to go back for the gun. Keep going. Stop. Don't move. - Show me your papers, please. - Just a minute. I forgot them at home. My cousin and I are just out for a walk. We live close by. Has something bad happened? - No, everything's fine. Let's go. - No. Wait. Lift up his trouser leg. - Police boots. Arrest them! - You're under arrest. Nice doing business with you. The black market has carte blanche, huh? - What are you talking about? - The cops aren't on your back. I don't miss them. Was it necessary to send them to Germany? Not all of them. Some of them work for us now. - Uniformed? - No. - What's in your bag today? - What do you need? Sugar? Coffee? If you can track down this lovely lady, you'll get a big bag of cash. Read her file. I'll do my best. Want to buy me a drink? Nordborg treats us to half a bottle of Schnapps and three lemon sodas. I find it scary without the police. Rapists and thieves can do harm. The hipo boys'll keep us safe. Or just stick with me. Then you're bound to be shot. We'll wipe out those terrorists. We're rolling up their network. - Cowards and amateurs to boot. - Good luck. As Captain Sommer said in his speech: "If they use guns, we'll use machine guns. We demand action in Denmark and will stomp all over Denmark." Do you think Stalin shits his pants over your stomping? Show some hon our and help protect women and children from the Commies. The Reds will rip the cross from our Danish flag. I can't stomp with this leg. - And I don't shoot civilians. - You're bloody impossible. Cheers to all the stomping, Ove. Night down memory's lane peaceful spring thaw down the road we remember their names they have now all found peace after trouble and strife. Don't move. - Put this on! - What's going on? - Take it easy. What is it? - Just put it on, for god's sake. Come on. Stop the machine! Cut out that filth! Mrs Lismal? So nice to see you again. How are you? Trygve Kvam. We met at your wedding. I'm a good friend of Willi. - My condolences. - Come on. I have a job I'm not sure you're going to like. - A liquidation? - We'll hit your father's factory. If that's a problem, we'll respect it, but you're the best man for the job. - I've made my stand. - I'm pleased to hear it. The German section is closely guarded. - We need support from other groups. - You'll get all the support you need. - I look forward to hearing from you. - We'll start right away. Liva? The head of the cover group is here. Is the plan ready? - When is Petersen coming? - Tonight I'm Petersen. We have the apartment to ourselves when the meeting's over. I love you. Go to him. - Hello. I'm Finn. - Hello. They call me the Jutlander. So this is how you look. The gates open at 7.00. Walther and Nymand enter disguised as workers. You overpower the guards while we carry in the explosives. - And I drive the truck? - Yes. We mount the machine gun on the platform. Leif, you shoot. If the alarm goes off, the Germans can only come from this spot. - They're right in your line of fire. - But the workers go past there, too. They're stopped by our cover group before we blow it up. Valdemar? Here. Have some water. You can't go like that. - You have a high fever. - I have to go anyway. They're counting on me. - Let's get a doctor. - Yes. They can't go without me. I have to go. Valdemar, look at me. Why is it so important? - What's keeping him? - I told him off the last time. It didn't seem to sink in. You should've smacked him. I have to do something. Easy now. It's my brother. - Where's Valdemar? - He has a high fever. - I promised to take his place. - You can't. Valdemar said he was the driver. I'm a better driver than he is. - I even have a driving license. - We risk opening fire. - Are your nerves stable? - How should I know? If you can find someone else, I'm off. - We're already late. - Very well. You know the neighbourhood. The truck... Aksel. I won't shoot anybody. Concentrate on driving. We'll handle the rest. Alarm. Close the gates. - Damn! They're on to us. Run. - Close the gates. Drive, goddamn it! What's going on? Knud, goddamn it. Hello! Help! Help! Hello! We need help! The guy here. - What happened? - He was shot. - Take his legs. - Be careful! My brother has just been admitted. Your brother was dead when he arrived. I'm so sorry. I wrote in his records that it was a car accident. I should never have let him do it. It's not your fault. He wanted to do it. The Danish Brigade's Camp Tingsryd. INFIRMARY Thank you. Karl... Is it the boys? Yes. What's the matter, Karl? It's Knud. They shot him. They couldn't save him. Knud? How could this happen? I don't know the details... Aksel was involved. And I was so happy that he wasn't involved in all of those dangerous things. Aksel got him into it. He did the same with Valdemar. He's completely reckless. But Knud? Knud? Why didn't you speak to him? Couldn't you have talked him out of it? I knew nothing about it. And I don't know what the hell I could have done. No one listens to me anyway. Our children do just as they please. And following your example certainly hasn't made them any more cautious. - Are you blaming me for Knud's death? - I'm not blaming anybody. But no matter what I do to ensure the safety of my family I'm told that it's all wrong and done for all the wrong reasons. Enough, Karl. We've just lost Knud and all you think about is yourself. I'm the only one who doesn't care about myself. The rest of you run around trying to be heroes regardless of what it might do to the rest of the family. - Is that how you think of me? - Yes, it bloody well is. Karl, you're not yourself. I only am when I act the way you want me to. - Please calm down. - Don't touch me! Please, we have sick people here. We'll be sure to keep it down. I won't take up more of your time. What's going on here? Who are they working for? Ask the foreman. He's in there. Doctor Koch. What's going on here? And why haven't I been informed? I demand an explanation. You were recently in Sweden visiting your wife, correct? Yes. I'm told a tragedy has befallen your family. - My deepest condolences. - Thank you. My heart goes out to you, but I'm sure you understand that after this failed attempt at sabotage, increasing security here is absolutely essential. You'll have to excuse me. We're in a terrible hurry. Herr Braunschweig, please give Director Skov a copy of the new security regulations. This area is the only one left under our control. The two sections will be totally separate. - And I won't set foot in theirs. - That's probably for the best. What will the workers say? As long as the guards are Danish and well-behaved, I don't think it will be an issue. And the Germans are happy. As they should be. It was their idea. January 1945. Your group will keep the job. But before we approve the mission, you need to provide Command with a meticulously detailed plan. You need to hurry. How far along are you? Security has increased at the factory. To hit the military production, we have to access the German section. But we'll find a way. Believe me. Ten minutes, then I have to go. - You're gorgeous. - Promise? - Promise me. - I promise. All right. I love you. Shut up. - It's lovely, Mathiesen. - I did my best. - A gentleman is asking for you. - Who is he? He didn't say. He's up at the masonry yard. MASONRY YARD Aksel. - It's so good to see you. - You, too. Britta said you wanted to help. Is that true? Yes. Did you know that she's pregnant? - Is she certain? - Yes. She's excited. I'm just not sure how brave I am when it comes down to it. No one knows until they're in it. But you won't be in any danger. - I just want to make a difference. - Even if it involves Elektrona? - Are you planning to blow it up? - They're working for the Germans. What do you want me to do? I need to know the location and schedule of all the guards. How do I get the information to you? You know the cobbler on Lindegaardsvej? Tell him you have a message for Laurits. That's it. I'll see what I can do. Are you in touch with Valdemar? He keeps blaming himself for letting Knud take his place. What about Dad? Does he blame me? He's heartbroken. But does he blame me? No, he just thinks that... Yes. He does. I'm so happy that you trust me, Aksel. Hello, Sigurd. Have some cake. - It's Mrs Jokumsen's birthday. - Be sure to thank her for me. Will do. Working late today? Yep, it's a late-night shift. Now you have something to sweeten the time. Bye now. Excuse me, would you like some cake? Here you go. You have a long night ahead of you? Look at that. She just can't help herself, that army slut. The director's daughter wouldn't want a yokel like him. She had it on with a German. It seems she didn't get enough. Bye for now. Are they biting? Not yet, but a man can hope. Yeah. And so you should, Sigurd. - How do you know my name? - I know everything about you. You work for the Germans at Elektrona. I'm not thrilled about it. But my kid is sick and my wife has a bad back. I'm not a Nazi. I see. Even though you joined the Nazi Party in 19407 I stopped paying the fee and got thrown out. You have an opportunity now to show your true colours. There's no questioning my colours. Good. Now listen up. The coast is clear? There's a tunnel running from factory hall B to where they make the operating systems. Our explosives will have maximum impact there. How's the security? We have a man on the inside in the Danish section. The German section is heavily guarded by troops with machine guns able to rake the street and the square. Can we rely on your group if they open fire? Exiting will be critical. - I have to go now. - Could you wait a bit? No. Anyway, good luck. How do you move the explosives in? We divide them between eight men for easy transport. I'll need three experienced guys. Can I count on you? I have some dependable boys. Where are the gun pits situated? I have a diagram in my jacket. Finn? Finn, did you doze off? Sorry about that. Right, um... There's likely to be a machine gun on the west side, and one on the north side by the gate. - It's five past. Has he stood us up? - He wouldn't dare. There he is. Go! That's it. Go! If they sound the alarm, take out the searchlight first. The gunner will be hard to pick off hiding behind those sandbags. Better take this with you. - Where's the other guard? - In the basement with a telephone. He calls the operations room every five minutes. They control the gates. I was hoping for Bentsen. He'd never fire a shot. I fear this new guy is a Nazi. All right. Down! Damn it, we're seven minutes behind. Go! Hands up! Freeze, or we shoot! - Where's the key to the lattice door? - The man asked you a question. No idea. The janitor probably has it. It's only ever used if a pipe bursts. - Is that true? - No. I'm counting to three. One. Two. Don't! The key is in that box. Which one is it? This one. Now call the operations room and tell them the usual. No funny business. Sure thing. - And mind the time. - Right. Ten seconds. Anti-sabotage guard Ibsen reporting. - Right, let's go. - He gave them the alarm code. - You liar! - It's not true! - Stop it! Are you sure? - He should have said "All clear." It's been changed. I swear it. No time to waste. We're going in now. The rest of you cover us and keep an eye on this guy. Walther. Don't shoot until you hear me whistle. Got it? Just a false alarm. Workers have to be arriving now. There will be casualties. We have to warn them. - There could be soldiers up there. - That's a risk we have to take. Get out of here. We're bombing the factory. Get out! Now! - We have ten minutes. - Go! - Are the fuses lit? - Yes. You warned the Nazis. If they shoot at us, we're using you as a shield. We get over the wall, the worst is over. Two minutes! Jump! Yes, Kurt? Right. Thank you. Right. What did he say? They've blown up Elektrona. Did anyone get hurt? I forgot to ask. It's all over. You'd better go and check on any damage. No. I haven't got the strength. Come on, Dad. I'll go with you. Please sit. His papers are probably false. - It's all in the report. - Thank you. - Did the doctor see to him? - No. It's only a flesh wound. He will endure for a long time. Excellent. - Thank you, Kriminalrat. - To work, gentlemen. Heil Hitler. Nymand. That's not your real name. But it is. Do we really need to waste time doing this? We have far more important things to discuss. You fired upon the Wehrmacht outside the Elektrona factory shortly after the bombing. Which group do you belong to? BOPA? Are you a Communist? Nope. I see. Then why did you shoot? I was afraid. Where did you get the gun? I found it in the street. I don't have time for this. Stardust. Britta speaking. Yes. Yes, he's here. I'll put him on. Yes? When? Understood. The Germans have arrested one of our mates and taken him to their HQ. You and Aksel need to make for Sweden. Promise me. Nymand, goddamn it. Go! Search the whole place! Good evening. - We're looking for Ole Pedersen. - I don't know who that is. Hey, let me go! I said, let me go! - Ole Pedersen? - Yes. I hope you have a good explanation, Valdemar Skov. I know we can do it. Ten men can overpower the Germans en route from the prison to HQ. We cannot risk the lives of so many of our companions. Nymand and your brother will have squealed. I can muster the volunteers. I just need two cars and a rifle. And I need to speak to your contact inside the prison. You're not listening to me. Look at me! We cannot afford to lose more men in some insanely dangerous mission. - I'll take full responsibility. - You'll do no such thing. Freeze! And drop your gun! Aksel? - You want to shoot me? - Get over here. Now! Nerves getting to you, eh? The Gestapo have taken Valdemar. Only you can save his life. I'm a soldier. I'm not with the Gestapo. And even if I was, you don't scare me with that puny gun. This is your baby brother we're talking about. Does he mean nothing to you? No more than Knud did to you. And now you're about to have Valdemar's blood on your hands, too. Get your own house in order. Bring out the prisoners. Just a sec. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. - You're up early. - I need to speak to you. In private. Counterorders. To be carried out immediately. "For further interrogation." Signed by the Reich Plenipotentiary even. - You've made an effort. - The order is explicit. It's very skillfully done. I could pretend to be in good faith and hand the prisoner over to you. Just obey the order. You're going down for this. You should know that. Just hand over the prisoner, Ove. Release the prisoner! Valdemar Skov, you're wanted for further interrogation. - Assuming custody of the prisoner. - Understood. Heil Hitler. Attention! How's Dad taking it all? It's hard to tell. I can't get a word out of him. But he's terrified about what will happen to Valdemar. He managed to escape. Really? Now they're accusing me of helping him. - Did you? - I denied it, of course. And what did they say? I'm to be court-martialed in Berlin. I can't leave the barracks. - When? - I don't know, Helene. Everything is so chaotic here right now. Michael... Thank you, Michael. Thank you. When the hell do we get those extra men? I suspect Command is stalling on purpose. - Why would they do that? - Perhaps they've lost faith in us. That would be just grand. Walther. - Liva has been arrested. - Have they put her in jail? No. It was three days ago. She's been sent to a camp in Germany. What happened? She was to meet a man who claimed to have a weapons depot. A black-market trader called Arne Nordborg. He never showed up. The Gestapo did. - How do you know? - Ulrik. He was her cover. There were too many of them. He barely managed to escape. That dirty rat needs to die. Will you cover me? Of course. I'm sorry. My ulcer is bleeding again. I've promised my wife... That'll kill you. You need to be hospitalized before it's too late. Go straight to Gentofte Hospital and ask for Doctor Sondergaard. - I hope that won't be necessary. - Let the doctor be the judge of that. - Get going. - Thank you. Get well soon, Walther. We'll let your wife know. I'm really sorry. Take care of yourselves. We should get Command's permission to kill the rat. That won't be necessary. We know he ratted on Liva. - Do you love her? - IT do. Have you done it? - What do you mean? - You know what. Yes, we have. Why didn't you tell me? You never asked. - We must be able to trust each other. - What do you take me for? Ulrik will telephone him in two minutes. Do you think he'll suspect? How would you react to hearing your mother had been hospitalized? Yeah, you're right. If we both survive this war and Liva comes back... - You understand me? - No. I will do anything to have her. It's not for us to decide, Finn. Liva has always been her own boss. Bloody hell, there he is. No! Intense fighting last night on the streets of Copenhagen, and in the vicinity of the German barracks. In Dyrehaven and at Gentofte Town Hall, German troops fought amongst themselves. This just in: Montgomery has stated that the German forces in the Netherlands, North-Western Germany and Denmark have surrendered. This is London calling. Did you hear that? How wonderful. - Now Mum can finally come home. - Yes, honey. Get Aage and Annelise in here. Congratulations! - The last of the real brandy. - Thank you. A toast to peace. To peace! Cheers. What a dreadful ordeal it's all been. We will forever miss Svend and Knud. But now we can look forward. Perhaps bring the family together. But what happens now? No one knows. I've been calling the Ministry for days, but they haven't returned my calls. Let me try the Permanent Secretary's home number. Have another. I've been saving it for this day. Director Skov seemed so nervous. I don't think he's slept a wink. He fears his political allies will abandon him even though they asked him to work with the Germans. - They can't deny it. - You don't know much about politics. What's going on? German pig! I'm worried about Dad. I should go home and warn him. I know you, you little jerrybag! - Annelise! - How dare you? - Annelise, help me! - Helene! Valdemar! Valdemar, thank God. Helene has been arrested by freedom fighters. Do something! They're shooting from the observatory. We need to end that. We'll get two men in... - Aksel, I need to speak to you. - Not now. - Helene has been arrested. - You may leave. Helene? I'm Louise. Don't you recognize me? Helene Skov, a member of my group has been arrested by mistake. - She's in cell seventeen. - Give me the keys. - I can't do that. - Give me the damn keys! Let me go! Aksell. Come on. Aksel, it's me! Louise. Thorup's wife. Get me out of here. So rich broads get away with sucking Kraut cock, huh? Are you taking her home to her collaborationist dad? You call that justice?! I'll do everything in my power to make sure you're not put on trial. But it won't be easy. But I've made considerable donations to the Resistance. And I've always followed all applicable laws to the letter. Which is much to your credit, but there will be new laws passed. - Surely not retroactive ones? - It's been done before. And with the current climate it might be done again. There's even talk about reinstating the death penalty. But it would only apply to crimes like murder and so on. You'll be fine. We aim to limit the number of trials for political reasons. We wouldn't want to cripple the business community with arduous trials. Such things rarely benefit the national economy. - So I have nothing to fear? - Certainly not. If you should be indicted, and I do mean if, you will be notified well in advance. Gee, thanks. But given the current climate I would go and visit your family in Sweden, if I were you. Just until things have calmed down a bit. The director is upstairs. - Is it him? - Yes. Him and his wife are both rats. - Aage Thorup, you dirty rat. - It's not true! No, stop it! - Hey! What's going on? - Thorup is a rat. - Nonsense. Who is your superior? - None of your damn business. No, I won't! - We'll get to you later. - Get in! Sit down! Karl. How are the children? Michael is dead. Our three are still in one piece. - Where are the boys? - I don't know. Aksel won't see me. I have to go to Sweden for a while. Will you join me? I miss the children so. Very well. I'll see you when you get back. Are you sure? Mum? Mum... Aksel seems so depressed. I know. He claims everything is fine, even though it clearly isn't. I'm worried about him. - Just leave him alone. - What do you mean? Just what I said. - Something is clearly wrong. - Is it about your father? No. He wrote him off a long time ago. It's Liva. Liva? What about her? She came back and married Leif. Don't mention it to him. I should be getting home. What about you? Sure, let's pack up. We can have an ice cream at the station. The trials drag on while countless traitors still haven't faced justice. Calm down, Aksel. That belly looks so cute on you, Britta. - What're you doing? - It's Langaa who ratted on Erling. Henning Langaal! No! No! No! Aksell. What the hell are you doing? You idiot! Aksel, the war is over! The killing is done! Subtitles: Malene Hollnagel Scandinavian Text Service
