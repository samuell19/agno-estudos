Everyone knows where LA is. You tell someone, do you know where Oxnard is? Hardly anyone knows, unless they've heard about the story. It was a bad thing that happened, horrible thing that happened. We all learned a lot about life through this, and I know people on the outside have learned a lot about themselves through this. Like, I just woke up like it was just another morning. But I was sick, and I didn't wanna go to school, but I pushed myself to go to school. I had bought a new sweater the day before, so I was quite happy to wear it and stuff. And then mom drove me to school, gave her a kiss goodbye. Everyone was just hanging out like they usually do before the bell rings. We walked down to the computer lab. Larry and I walked together. The rest of the class was behind us. He brought me little flowers in a Dixie cup. He was just a sweetheart of a kid. He was a little smaller, you know, those kind of kids. You tend to... okay, you just wanna protect 'em. We went to type our essays for Holocaust, Anne Frank and stuff like that. It's so fricking ironic. It's a unit on tolerance. Everybody sat down and we started typing. I was walking around, up and down, and checking on people's things, and then all of a sudden, I heard this pop. Like a loud bang, like a balloon popped. And I just knew somebody had exploded one of those computers, and I turned around and Brandon was standing. I said, "What the hell are you doing?" I don't know how long it took for me to realize that was a gun. I stood up from my chair and I was able to see over the computer. I just saw his eyes. I looked at him, he looked at me, and then all of a sudden, there was another pop. He just gave him another one back of the head, and he dropped. Miss Boldrin tried helping Larry, but she was too shocked and paranoid. She didn't know what to do. Brandon put the gun down and he ran out. 911 Emergency dispatch You're at E.O. Green School? Yes. Shots were fired by Room 42 on campus. Do you know where the person with a gun is? No. - Who's the victim? - Is there a victim? I'm on the phone with dispatch. Larry! We need an ambulance. The ambulance is on the way. They should be there staging any time now, okay? Everyone was screaming, like the kids that had seen it, like the blood and everything, I guess. There was somebody else doing first aid. All I kept thinking is let him know I'm here. He knows my voice, and he was just looking around and trying to find me. So he was definitely hearing me. He was vomiting and gasping, and thrashing around, obviously in extreme pain. One of the people in the office came on the intercom, and she sounded really frantic and it was, like, "We're on lockdown. This is not a drill." These giant cops came in with huge guns and, like, kicked the door open. We've realized since Columbine, there was a potential for more victims. There was a potential for more suspects, so they had to start searching the school. 30 people come in with the full-on suit and with like lights on their helmets and guns, like they were pointing them everywhere, and that just even got us more scared. Our first priority is what do we do with the children that were in the classroom that actually directly visually witnessed what happened. They were put into a spare room. We put on a movie for 'em, and staged some officers in the room. Let's stick these 20, what, five of us in a room. Let's put on "Jaws". Not a cartoon, or... Let's put on "Jaws". There was a huge line, all the way down the street of parents waiting to pick up their children. There were children could have been hurt and they were just having them wait outside in a line, like nothing's happened. Hi, everybody, I wanted to let you know a quick update on the incident that happened this morning out at E.O. Green School in Oxnard. The victim is in surgery right now at St. John's hospital, so we're keeping our fingers crossed, saying our prayers for this young man, and the suspect in this case fled the area and he was apprehended by police just a couple of blocks away. My friend Matt pulled up and came walking in, and I was, like, "Hey, how's it going?" He was, like, there was a shooting at E.O. Green and I said, "Yeah, I heard on the radio. It's, like, crazy?" and he was all, "Brandon was involved with that," and I honestly thought, like, he was the one who got shot and I'm, like, "Is he alive, is he ok" you know? And he's, like, "No, like, he shot a kid." I just fell to my knees and started crying, and I started screaming "No!" That's all I really remember, is just screaming no, and smashing holes in everything. And then some detectives showed up and tried to talk to me... and I, like, you know, he's not the victim here, I don't understand why you're so upset. What's your full name, son? Brandon. Is that B Yes, sir. Your middle name. David, McInerney. Me and my brother looked up to my little brother, because he was the good one. He never did no drugs, never got drunk. We were all doing that when he were his age. He was all about keeping his life straight and then, and then all this happened. Just turned 15? 14, sir. 14, yeah, 14. People did look at Brandon as older than he really was. Deep down, he was still a kid, you know, he still bought action figure toys and he played with Pokémon cards. I heard that he got caught like a couple of streets over, but I was still scared. When I found out someone got shot, I knew automatically that it was Larry. Yeah. Same here. The first time that I met Larry, some kid was over there and the kid said something to him, and Larry got in his face and said, "Hey, I am who I am, so don't..." you know, and I ran over there and I got in that kid's face and said, "You know what, just leave this kid alone, you know?" That's when we became friends, you know. We're like brothers, so we look after each other. We would go to get clothes, right, from the front, donated clothes. He would always go for the girls clothes for some reason. I'm like, what? We had on episode during Christmas break where he got make-up he put on. It was purple and bright, and my God, it was the first time I'd seen him put make-up on, and he goes "What do you think?" and I go, "I think you look like a clown" and, being a woman who puts on make-up, "I can tell you that." So we got a VST, take him in and really show him how to put it on but not put it on. Further in, all of a sudden... the boots appeared and I remember thinking I can't... walk in those things all day. I don't know how he's doing it. He's a tough kid, but he's strong willed, and I remember telling him one time, Larry, you really shouldn't be wearing heeled shoes to school, because, it's, you know, because it's dangerous. When you're doing PE, and so he put on tennis shoes and went out the door with me. Little did I know, he had tucked his heels into a backpack. Whenever Brandon talked about Larry, it was about what Larry was wearing, 'cause it really was just, weird. It was, like, off the wall to him. It was off the wall to me, too. I think Larry was kind of shoving it in everyone's face. For you to come to school dressed like that, you're making a big statement. At Christmas time, Larry said very shyly, "I've got a present for you." And it was a little blanket and a mouse that he had crocheted for my cat. And I said, "My, that's so sweet," and I opened it in front of him and gave him a hug. My cat didn't show any interest in either item. It's admirable that he was crocheting scarves for soldiers in the Middle East, but nobody in the seventh grade crochets. Everybody was making fun of him. They were using him as, like, like sexual jokes, like, "Dude, you're so gay", "you're gonna date Larry when you grow up." ♪ I thought I could be God ♪ The Valentine's Day game is where everyone says the first person that comes to their mind, who they think is cute, and they have to go up to that person and ask them to be their Valentine. And Larry thought Brandon was cute. He had to go up to Brandon, and it just so happened that Brandon's friends were around him, so he got real embarrassed when Larry asked him to be his Valentine. Larry made a comment to the effect of, I love you, baby. Brandon was offended by Larry's effeminate demeanor. He was really disgusted by who Larry was, and I think it made him very angry. Brandon approached another student, a girlfriend of Larry's, and he told her, "Say goodbye to your friend, Larry, because you're not gonna see him after tomorrow." Oxnard police detectives obtained a search warrant for the residence, which belonged to Brandon's grandfather. The grandfather's room had a couple of long guns, and then there were a number of hand guns. There was ammunition as well, placed on the top shelf of Brandon's bedroom. The morning it happened, my phone rang at 7:35 and it was him. I was gonna call him right back and I didn't. Many times, I've been sitting in that room and just wanted to say, "What were you calling for", and I still don't know. He called you before it happened? The victim in this case, his condition seems to be improving a little bit at the hospital. Hopefully, he continues to be on the mend, so that's great news. It was a whole bunch of well he's stable, he's in critical condition but he's stable. He's dead. That's what we heard. And then, and then, like, five minutes later, he's okay. That wasn't a very happy Valentine's Day for anyone. I thought Larry was gonna survive. The teacher was, like, he's gonna survive it because it wasn't a strong enough gun. But then, Valentine's came, and they gave us the news that he passed away. ♪ And I can't change ♪ ♪ Even if I tried ♪ ♪ Even if I wanted to ♪ ♪ And I can't change ♪ ♪ Even if I tried ♪ ♪ Even if I wanted to ♪ ♪ My love my love my love ♪ ♪ She keeps me warm ♪ ♪ She keeps me warm ♪ ♪ She keeps me warm ♪ I don't think people realize how brave Larry was, like, being out to that many people, like, it's must have been, like, extremely difficult. One, two, three! Larry! This is not political. I'm not a political person, but this is personal to me. A boy has been killed, and a number of lives have been ruined, and somewhere along the line, the killer, Brandon, got the message that it's so threatening and so awful and so horrific that Larry would want to be his Valentine that killing Larry seemed to be the right thing to do, and when the message out there is so horrible that to be gay you can get killed for it, we need to change the message. Larry was not a second class citizen. I am not a second class citizen. It is okay if you're gay. My heart goes out to everybody involved in this horrible, horrible incident. The whole of the families and this poor... Even, you know, Brandon's life has changed 'cause he did this. I just knew right off the bat that they were gonna try him as an adult. In my head, this is an area, like, yeah, he's going to jail for the rest of his life. Although he kept saying, like, he'd never be able to love a girl, you know, he'll never be able to, you know, get drunk and do something stupid, like, he never even got in trouble before. There are so many things he never got to do, you know, like, he'll never have to drive a car or, you know, ditch school. It just constantly kept running through my head is all the things he'll never be able to do. I didn't know anything about it until I read a little article. You know, he's 14, and that it's a classmate, and that it was charged as a hate crime and that he was looking at life in prison. I was like, we should try to help this kid. Scott was working for United Defense Group and his boss said, yeah, we can do it pro bono, and then we just kind of sought out to help the family. Our passion is helping children in the juvenile delinquency arena and especially those that are charged as adults. It used to be that they would have a fitness hearing. The juvenile's background, mental health issues. The idea behind it is to rehabilitate, not to punish. But Prop 21 just cut that whole process out. I have a three defendant gang homicide where one victim was killed, three victims were seriously injured. They were shot multiple times with a Tec-9, which is a semi-automatic. Prop 21 intended to address this rather dramatic uptake in juvenile violence in the gang context, because a lot of pee-wees, as their older brethren called them, were put up to the task of committing these violent crimes because they knew they would only go into the juvenile facility where they would receive a mild slap on the hand and they would be out on the streets within a very short period of time. A lot of people thought that this was for gang kids. I don't think anybody anticipated that it would be used in the way that it's being used now. They're taking a 14 year-old who's barely, you know, 19 days after his 14th birthday and making that snap decision, we're gonna charge you as an adult, because we can. There are cases where juveniles have committed a homicide and we leave them in juvenile court. Because of the vicious nature of the crime, this is not a crime that the juvenile system is capable of handling. What do you do with someone like this, who is so dangerous that they plot out the execution of a classmate in front of the whole classroom full of people? What do you do with someone like that? And it's not always easy. I was working at a grocery store in Arkansas. I met this truck driver and he was going to Oxnard, California, and wanted to know if I wanted to go, and I said sure. So, I jumped in his truck the next morning and we drove out here. I'd never seen anything so beautiful in my life, and so I went home, and got James and Jeremy and moved here. She came here with me and my brother, on her own, and she met a guy who was willing to help her and stuff, and that was a big thing. He was the head sales manager for Cal Co motor sports. He promised me everything and bought me everything, and gave me everything, and we got married, when I was pregnant with Brandon. Billy was a fun guy. We went camping a lot, you know, and jet skiing and motorcycle riding. He seemed totally normal, and then once they got, like, serious, you know, moved in together, that's when he, like, just changed overnight. We were at one of my friend's engagement parties and no one really liked him, and so, I guess he thought it was a good idea that he took a gun with him to the party. So, it was like, you know, your dude has a gun. You guys need to get outta here. We finally got home and we started fighting... We heard 'em arguing, and me and Jeremy got up and we, like, went by the door and, like, I was, like, peeking out and I could see her, like, walking up the stair and he yelled, like, "Turn around and get back down here," and she was, like, no, whatever, and he's, like, "I'll shoot," and next thing you know, he did. I walked out there and she was laying on the stair and she, like, yelled at me to go back in the room. I could hear Billy, like, on the phone, 911, lying about it, like, "It went off, I didn't mean to, it just went off." Then, like, tried to, like, put things over her head so we couldn't see, but I still saw there was just, like, blood everywhere, all over the wall, over the stairs, like when you have wet shoes on, you get, like, squish, that's what it sounded like when you were walking down the stairs. And I found out the bullet went through my arm, through a wall, through a water heater, and landed right next to Jeremy on the pillow. It was a .45 automatic with a hollow point bullet. Larry had a very sad and difficult life. He was adopted by people who took his brother as well, but even after he and his brother were adopted, he had a pretty rough life. Larry would go to school and he would keep his jacket on or something, and when he finally took it off or, you know, you saw he would have bruises everywhere. And the county had been working to get him out. It was like 22 complaints about abuse and all of them went unfounded. Probation took him out of the home, for some bogus vandalism and theft. It was stealing food from their own refrigerator, yeah. They detained him at the Juvenile Justice Center, I believe, for one night before he went before the Judge and the judge placed him with us. The last months he was living in Casa Pacifica, which is a locally run shelter for abused and neglected children. I knew of him before he came. We had been working with Larry and his family for several years in their home. They just struggled as a family. There was just a lot of issues. I think a lot to do with his orientation and what he was trying to, to learn about himself. His parents never showed that they really loved him. He was so lovable. I mean, he was the nicest person. Any like, bruises or anything I ever saw, I always thought was from martial arts, because he always was, like, really tough. So I just thought anything was from that, like, I never really thought... I was really innocent in that. It was on Fourth of July the first time we drank, like, a beer, I think, and one beer when you're that little, you definitely feel it! One time he drank is, like, dating Sam, and Billy caught him and punched him in the face in front of everybody. I found the next day that he had a broken nose. My gosh, this is out of control, and he's, like, 12 years old, and he's getting hit in the face by a grown man. The students of my classroom requested counseling day after day after day, and they weren't getting it. They didn't do anything, and school went, like, my mum got a call saying that school would go, like, go back into session, like, that day. They don't care about what happened. They cared more about swine flu... Than they did about Larry. It's ridiculous. Like, at least one of our teachers every period talked about the swine flu. I requested the kids get laptops, because some of those kids were going back to, a computer lab that they had run into after watching somebody get shot, and the school didn't stop it. Can somebody just take us to Disneyland, so we can have one day all together? Because it was fresh right then. I even called Disneyland. They don't do that. They don't do school shootings. And then they'd just leave us to, like, pretty much fend for ourselves, when we don't know how to because we're young and no one gets taught how to go through something like that. Every single adult just fucked up everything at every step of the way and continues to and that's, I think, what's so frustrating for me. No one noticed for years and years and now we just wanna say sorry, adult. The judge at the trial of an Oxnard teenager accused of murdering a gay classmate is scheduled to hear a new motion today, for a change of venue that is likely to cause another major delay. The purpose of the change of venue motion, obviously, is to protect the defendant from press coverage which has turned the public against him. Where are we gonna go? Because the saturation is not just local, it's nationwide. What if we wind up in San Francisco County? I'd volunteer for that! Superior Court Judge Campbell refused to move the trial, but that doesn't mean the trial will get under way any time soon. I get, probably, two letters a week. He just got his first package, and it's all about cheese and peanut butter and jelly. He loves peanut butter and jelly. For a long time, Brandon thought that he was gonna get bailed out, and it was devastating when we had to tell him that it wasn't gonna happen. I think that really devastated Billy, too, that he knew that he wasn't gonna be able to bail Brandon out of jail and, you know, promising him stuff that he just couldn't, it was just unrealistic. He had the stability of being here for four and a half months, which I think was helpful for him to begin to heal. I was in the system from when I was five to when I was 18. I moved group home to group home, but I always ended up here. At Casa Pacifica, it's home, man. It's home. Larry showed his true self here. He felt comfortable around where he was, so he started coming out. This is Larry's. There was this staff member that could sing, you know. She was unbelievably good, so he's like, alright, and then he's singing. My gosh, that kid had a voice. It's amazing. Larry was an active kid. Always with people, laughing, smiling. When he was at Casa Pacifica, he was the happiest kid. I mean, it was, like, a total change. I mean it was amazing, and people liked to say, it got him more flamboyant. He started dressing up more. No, he started dressing up more because he felt better about himself. When Brandon was, like, eight, I came home and told James that I had quit my job at Vons and he said, "You fucked up", and I bet you're gonna be homeless in six months," and we were homeless pretty much in six months. My mom was on drugs, like, the whole time I was growing up. Living the life of a zombie, just high all the time. I moved out when I was, like, 17. I wasn't even 18, then, I just moved out. Because we were homeless anyways. Brandon went to live with Billy at Grandpa's house. It might not sound it, but it was most likely better for him to be with Billy at that point. And he had Billy up on this high pedestal, and Billy fell off, and he fell off hard, and far. He would seriously take Brandon with him on his drug runs, like when he was smoking crystal meth and stuff, and Brandon would be sitting there in their living room, sleeping, and he would, like, crawl under the coffee tables and fall asleep, just to, like, kinda, be out of sight of everybody. There was times when I picked Brandon up, and he, his knuckles were sore from being out in the front yard, hitting the tree in the front yard. It would be bloody. He wanted out of that house so bad, and every time he was with me, he was begging me to get a place to live so he could come live with me, 'cause I lived at the rehab for so long, and I couldn't do it. Tears were coming down his face, and he was saying how "James, don't make me go home, I don't wanna go." You know, we all got to leave Billy's situation, and he didn't. A real family is what he got at Casa Pacifica, and he felt stronger. He wanted to change, be a new person, and that's who his alter ego was. One day he would be Lucretia, and the next, like, Latonya, but it always started with "La". Everyone knew that Larry was part black. So it was like a generic kind of black name. You don't mess with... Latoya or Latonya. You know, you don't mess with her. At first people didn't talk to him at all. They thought he was crazy. I think that's kind of the thing he wanted. If they didn't talk to him, they weren't bothering him. It was just kind of relief, and so that kind of who that person was to him was kinda who he wished he was. I don't think that Larry is gay, he's transgendered. It's a big difference. I think that he was born in the wrong age. Hopefully, within the next 100 years, it will be perfectly acceptable, without the totally disgusting circumstances that I've had to grow up with. I was out in the open eighth grade. I, I actually regret the decision very much. Practically the whole school is Latino. So they're, like, "Gay!" There's a lot of misconceptions, and... My parents would send me to, like, therapy, with like some medical doctor for, like, a year and a half, like, trying to fix this, see, what's wrong with me and all this. But, like, the doctor ended up saying, like, how I'm perfectly fine, and my parents are just, like, old-fashioned and they're not open-minded. The occasional assault... Which is the equivalent of, like, fucking fag. That's what I hear, because, you know, or, or... Or just faggot... you know. Don't be gay! And then when people say, "That's gay." That gets you so mad! It's just basically ignorance. That is a plague of our school. When Brandon told me that Larry came to school in high heels, I was, like, why? I had a Black Flag... It's this punk rock band has a white shirt but with the Black Flag symbol underneath, and you could see it through my uniform, and instead of just telling me to take it off, you know, take off your undershirt, they suspended me for it. I got in trouble for everything. No collar... I would try to go to shirts, I'd try to wear a regular white shirt and not have a collar and try to get away with it. I mean, if it's a uniform dress code school, how come that one kid got an exception from everybody else? Larry only accessorized his school uniform for two weeks prior to his murder. The first day that I saw him accessorized, I called the District Office, and the District Office asked me did it say in our policy that girls could not wear make-up, and I said no. Then you cannot tell him that he cannot wear make-up. There was a law that had just passed in California, SB777, regarding not discriminating on gender identity or sexual orientation in the educational environment. I told Larry, if you want to come to school and accessorize your clothing, then you may. However, it's going to be very difficult, and if you can get through it, more power to you. He asked his teachers to call him Letitia instead of Larry. That made some students so uncomfortable, they bullied him. Using the "F" word against a gay or lesbian or transgendered student, it's kind of accepted. More and more teenagers are coming out. Over 80% of them say there's not one adult in the school situation that they consider to be supportive or helpful in any way. I had Larry as a student the previous year as a seventh grader and I knew his inclination. He had discussed it with me. When he asked me what to do about the situation, my response to him was nothing. What to do about this situation is nothing and to keep it private and to dwell upon it. Larry shouldn't have expressed himself so blatantly, openly, transsexual. He progressed day by day in his outward appearance as a girl. I was talking to my daughter and she had her old homecoming dress, and everybody knows you don't reuse your dresses, so I said can I give it to Larry, and he loved it. He just loved it! He ran into the bathroom and he tried it on. Miss Boldrin, it's a little big, but it fits great. My daughter's exceptionally small and petite. She's like a 00, so that'll tell you how small Larry was. Any teacher with a grain of salt really said it's out of control. I do believe in a heaven and a hell, and I do believe Larry, honestly, did not even have a clue the consequences of his actions. I relate to Brandon because I could see my own self being in that very same position. I don't know if I would have taken a gun, But a good, swift... kick in the butt might work really well. You're visiting. You are a nosey parker. Larry had a special need, this individualized educational program, which is IEP, where there are behaviors that you're trying to extinguish in the classroom. Larry had a behavioral goal, to not do exactly what he was doing, in the weeks before he died. It's a legally binding document. It should have been enforced, like any other legal document. Other teachers had a lot of issues with Larry, and because I didn't have any, they didn't like the way I was handling my situation. I didn't run around and tell everybody, "I gave Larry a dress, I gave Larry a dress." I'm the really cool angel on the horse coming down and saving all the little transgender children. I've been teaching for 30 years. Junior High, boys especially, are homophobic. I was convinced that the kids would take it into their own hands, since we did not. The Thursday before Larry was shot, I went into my Principal, and I said, "If you don't physically come in there and do something" to stop Larry's progression, the boys of this school are gonna take him out "behind the shed and beat him to death." You gave him a dress, and he thought he was queen for a day, and All of a sudden, he's dead. I'm quite sure Larry would not be dead if he had been my student that year. After Larry's death, a gay pride rainbow group of about 1,500 people are marching down Sea Street, right in front of our school. Now, who orchestrated that Gay Pride? In 14 years of teaching there, never seen that. Never seen it in the city of Oxnard, and... right in front of our school? What is that? Who orchestrated that? I have huge questions, huge questions. It's that tree right there with the big stakes. It's an Australian willow tree. It's a place to go where you can remember anyone you want to remember, and they don't have to necessarily be dead. They can be anyone, just anyone you wanna remember, and Larry was my inspiration for it, but I can't really say that it was for Larry on the plaque that I'm trying to get, because of school policy and stuff. They don't want to bring it up again. Everybody's extremely scared to talk. They're very scared. The day they sent me my termination letter, I told them you'd better as hell send me a really nice recommendation letter, then, and this is what came the next day. "At this time, Mrs. Boldrin feels the need "to change her teaching environment..." right? Unfortunately, we do not have other teaching positions "that meet her needs..." right? "Therefore, I support her efforts to find a position that would give her what she needs." I was extremely concerned as I started working for Starbucks, one, that I was gonna go bald wearing a hat. I feel really bad, come brew coffee at Starbucks with me inside Vons, and go from your $55 an hour job to nine and see what it's like. Larry King and I share more in common than just our names. We both believe that all students should be free to be themselves without the fear of name calling, bullying or harassment. Hundreds of thousands of students will take a vow of silence on April 25th as part of the 12th Annual National Day of Silence. They'll honor the memory of 15 year-old Larry King and the countless other students who have had their voices taken from them simply because of their sexual orientation or gender expression. He wasn't afraid to be who he was. Everyone was making fun of him. I didn't know what my friends would say if they saw me round him, so I just kept my distance. I felt guilty 'cause I know there are times that I said things to make fun of him. I feel extremely guilty. He had asked me, "How come you feel so comfortable with yourself? How can you act, you know, openly gay?" and I told him, "Larry", no one's gonna kill you for who you are. Everyone's different, "and that's just the way the world is." And a year later, he was shot to death because of how he was. Larry would always be in my heart, no matter what. I got this when I was 18. It says, "In loving memory of Larry King". He taught me things, you know, just to be who you are, stand up for yourself, you know. I mean, I stood up for myself, but to be strong. It helped me open up more and not care about what people say or how people think about the way I dress or the way I look. ♪ The truth hurts When you turn eighteen ♪ ♪ But the truth gets Even less easy ♪ ♪ But what do ya know? ♪ When he first got shot I used to think, like, what if it was me? People just find out that you're gay, and then they'll just go after you. It was the day of the murder. Once we were able to leave the school campus she was really scared, and then, you know, she just looks me and she says, "Mom, I'm gay." Okay. It was a surprise. She wore pink, she wore Spandex, everything! It wasn't the colors. Her hair, her pony tail went from up here to lower, and I don't know, it was just different little things that I would look at her and say. I just wanted her to be sure that's what she wanted, and I let her know that it was gonna be really tough. My mom took it good, not all the way, like, accepting, but she said that if that's what I wanted, then she would be there for me, and my dad just blew it off. The father of Brandon McInerney, the Oxnard boy accused of killing a classmate, was found dead this morning, just hours before his son was to appear in court. The Medical Examiner says the 45-year-old died from a blunt force head injury related to alcohol. The toxicology report is pending. The day he died, I put the biggest smile on my face. I didn't give a shit, you know. Like, I cried, because I had to be the one to tell Brandon, you know. I honestly felt that way. And even when James told Brandon, the first thing Brandon said was, "I knew it was gonna happen. I just didn't know when." He didn't even cry. I was the only one crying, and that's what scared the crap out of me. I did not want to leave him, like, when they told us, like, that we had to go. I didn't want to go. I was afraid of what he was gonna do, and ever since that took over, he shows no emotion, or whatever. Like, Brandon always showed emotion until that day. There it goes. The kid on the right is doing nothing, and McInerney just stands up and boom, starts whaling away on him. He's not used to following the rules, and I believe that he's a bully, and he's kind of a thug. I mean, clearly, there might have been words spoken between them, but you can see from the film it's completely unprovoked. The kid walks out. McInerney, who's kind of doing his laundry or something, he sees him, and he just runs over there and the same thing, he starts beating the guy up. I don't know. Nice! It doesn't surprise me that they're having a difficult time coming up with a defense. Here's one of my subpoenas. I have, like, a case full of these. Yeah, it's just... And I get these all the time, and when they call, I ignore them, simply because nothing's going on. It's like every time they show up for court, there's a reason why it isn't going. One thing built upon the previous thing to drag out the case, which is another, a not uncommon defense tactic, try to wear everybody down and hope that they get a lesser plea or the witnesses go away. That's kind of defense lawyer 101. They wanted him to accept a life sentence. From the get go, we told them, well, first of all, he should have been in juvenile court. We explored and tried those issues, and tried to set them up for appeal, etcetera, but the system is only as fair as the players. Mclnerney, who is being held at the Juvenile Justice Center, will turn 17 January 24th. The victim, Lawrence Forbes King would have turned 18, and that case is now going to return to court on Valentine's Day next year. This is the first time when he put Samantha McInerney and I was, like, my gosh. "Hey beautiful, I wish I could tell you in person" how much I love you, but it will have to be on paper for now. I'm going to buy a marriage packet, "and I will send it to you whenever." When I think about a guy being the one to marry, like for the rest of my life, he's definitely probably my number one pick, 'cause he's, like, the only one that's ever cared. I just love him... way too much. When I first looked at these drawings, the first page when you start seeing lightning bolts, is it doodling, is it? Okay. When I started getting a little farther into the notebook, where I was noticing drawings that stood out to me to be unusual. It's not just the book in his backpack, it's going through these books. 12th SS, The History of the Hitler Youth Panzer Division, volume one and two. You oughta go to any backpack in the city of Oxnard of any kid in the school district, they're probably not going to have volume one and volume two of this. This isn't just doing history. This is not Anne Frank. The doodling that I saw in my kids' notebooks were really very interesting, but the swastika, they would copy and those who were artistically inclined the whole Adolf Hitler with the mustache and the hand and the "heil", and, you know, walking into class after being taught some of these things, the very next day, it would be perfectly normal, "Heil!" for kids to come in and say, "Heil!" This particular image was the most disturbing for me, seeing the hand crushing the Star of David and the blood coming from it as cracks. It's hard, because I know Holocaust survivors. This is a very, very strong message. It's very, very powerful. To me, it's... this is somebody who would want to see this happen again. It very quickly looked to me as though I was dealing with, at the very least, a budding white supremacist, who very well may have acted against his effeminate and far physically smaller victim, either because of his sexuality or because of his race, knowing that, that Larry King was biracial. This is where Brandon and his friends used to hang out. Brandon had, like, a thing for calling people nigger. He called me a couple of times, and I kinda lost it, and I hurled off and I socked him in the head in the middle of class, and I didn't get in trouble, in fact, because I told my teacher what had happened, and she wasn't gonna put me in trouble for that, and so, I was really mad at him, and after that, he never really ever called me nigger or anything. I'm afraid of people who feel very strongly that juveniles should not be tried as adults, because they want to be on the case so bad that they'll lie in jury selection when you ask them their feelings about a certain subject, and I'm really afraid of the stealth homosexual haters in this case. I believe they're gonna present some kind of a gay panic defense, that somehow Larry King, based on what he did or said provoked Brandon into doing what he did. This trial finally starts after several years today. Defense attorneys told the jury that, while McInerney indeed killed King, it was not a premeditated act of murder. Brandon may have been bullied too, by Larry, in fact. Larry had, reportedly, told people the two were dating but had broken up, and just a couple of days before the shooting, classmates say Larry had asked Brandon to be his Valentine, and Brandon's friends joked the two would make gay babies together. What Larry was doing to Brandon was an extreme form of bullying. It was an extreme form of sexual harassment. When playing basketball at lunch, Larry had wobbled onto the court, interrupted the game in front of all Brandon's basketball buddies, and asked him if he would be his Valentine. To have any guy ask you that in front of all your peers, but to have a guy who's wearing high heels and make-up, that would be, like, the ultimate humiliation. It was very disturbing to all the boys and so they, you know, kind of talked about it in a guy way, macho way. It's bad enough to have this kid who wears girls' clothes, you know, breaking all the rules, but then, you know, guys don't hit on guys. If you want to really insult a guy, you call him gay. Brandon was thinking that he needed to get rid of Larry, he needed to save everyone from this, you know, this scourge that had come up on the school. When I think of Larry, I think of, like, butterflies. There's a picture of him, holding, like a, I think it's a caterpillar, with him just, like, smiling. It's for Larry. The last tattoo I'm ever getting. It says hope. Day two took such an emotional turn that we're told the bailiff had to keep restocking the courtroom with facial tissue, because of all the tears. About a half a dozen students testified, saying the same thing, that King was a loner who was ignored until he came out and started wearing make-up and heels, and that other students randomly mocked him. One of them, though, that had the most riveting testimony, was a girl known simply as Mariah T. She was a friend of Larry King's, was also sitting behind him when those fatal shots rang out. Just spell your name. M-A-R-I-A-H. Thank you. Miss Fox? - Hi, Mariah. - Do you remember that morning? Yes. What did you see Breathe. You okay? Do you want to take a break, Mariah? Why don't we take a break? Thank you for everything. Walked into the courtroom, and I remember seeing her look over at the defendant, and she gets up on the witness stand. I asked her one or two questions and she just lost her mind. She turned away from the defendant and she just kind of collapsed and started sobbing. Everyone asks me how I would react if I ever saw Brandon, and I always would say that, like, I would attack him, but at the same time, like, and I know what it's like to be alone, and unfortunately that's what he turned to, because that's what he was taught. I mean, look at this place, it's gorgeous. It's a beautiful view. This is a public area, anybody can come here, but the reality is, not anybody can come here. Something as simple as a memory board for a friend that died, they take the time, not just to commemorate that he was a surfer or to talk about his persona, but to put the nautical sign on there. It's this diamond, and that "X" right there. The SSL, Silver Strand Locals, is a gang moniker. The acronym, SSL, it's often done in graffiti with a kind of a runic lightning bolt looking "S", very similar to the Schutzstaffel "S" from the Nazi era. You think of beach, you think, like, white surfers or something. White is a minority now. You don't see a lot of white people, like fully white people, like me, like, white, like, or, like, like Brandon, like, we were white, like. You will, like, you see like, tan people, you see, like, you can just tell when someone... It's not a bad thing. Brandon had at least one mentor that we know of who is a dyed-in-the-wool neo-Nazi racist skinhead. Matt Reaume told us that Brandon McInerney's half brother, James Bing, knew that Brandon was getting into white supremacy and brought him to Matt Reaume specifically to educate him. Matt is white, they said a white separatist, you know. Matt doesn't hate you because of your skin color. He believes, you know, a white man should have a white wife, a black man should have a black wife. A black woman should have a black husband, you know, just to save your, your ethnicity. It could have been me the whole time instead of Larry. I don't really feel like being surrounded by people. Sometimes I just feel like a ghost. I watched the movie, "Boys Don't Cry". That made me have nightmares, too. Even dressing like a boy could get you killed. I had a dream that that was gonna happen to me. I just kept having the flashbacks. I'd be driving, and just start crying. I'm just never gonna see the world the way I did before February 12th. If I fall and break my leg, easy, I know what the problem is, but with the post traumatic, you don't know what's gonna set it off. My family couldn't handle it. They couldn't handle the anxiety, the crying, the despair. I had overdosed on drugs, I had tried to commit suicide, and I almost did it, because I was on a life support for three days. I'm really excited to see Mariah and Marina, I really am. I've missed 'em. The last time I physically saw them was literally the day I walked off the job. What I've learned is that truly nobody's ever prepared for any of this, and everybody just thinks, "The cops and the school, they've always got it handled." They don't have shit. I think the day of the shooting was the first day I dressed like a guy. Yeah. And when I saw you, you know, like, hey, and then I couldn't recognize her. But I love it. I like it a lot. The week before the shooting, I had an epiphany. I was out monitoring the students after school, and I saw this pretty little girl, and she had really short hair with these dangly pretty earrings, and these high heeled boots and beautiful little figure, and then she turned around and I saw it was a boy. It clicked. This is Larry, and this is what all the rumblings are about, and now I understand. He came into my classroom before school with make-up on. I told him he needed to wash it off because we were working on his behavior issues. He wasn't supposed to draw attention to himself, and wearing make-up as a boy is definitely drawing attention to yourself. I saw Brandon sitting on the bench, very angry and upset. Brandon's friends, they were laughing at Brandon. That's when I first noticed Larry. He was kind of parading back and forth. It seemed like he was trying to get Brandon's attention. Nobody else at E.O. Green hated Larry to the point that they wanted to hurt him. Brandon suggested they jump Larry, they beat him down, but nobody would help him do that, so he was basically gonna do it all by himself. Brandon's dad was gonna take him to school, and he walked outside, and Brandon actually forgot the gun and had to go back in and get it. Now there's an opportunity where fate has actually made you forget. The one key element you need to commit a murder is the weapon and instead of maybe taking a clue or, you know, getting scared he's gonna get caught, he just no, oops, I forgot the gun. I gotta go back in and get it. Even though Brandon was consumed by these feelings, there was a chance to stop and think. Larry was called out of the class, and during Larry's absence, Brandon began to have second thoughts. You know, he had his hand in his sweatshirt pocket where the gun was. He was, at that point, thinking maybe I won't do this. The ultimate trigger was Larry saying, "I've changed my name to Letitia." When he heard that, it just obliterated any reserve or restraint that he had. That took it to another level. This guy, who is doing these things to me, is not going to be calling himself by a girl's name. The admissions that Brandon made to Dr. Hoagland were so damning and corroborated the entire prosecution theory. I thought it was over. He did not pull a Columbine. He did not go and shoot everybody he could. He shot Larry King because he didn't know what else to do to make it stop. It's not a murder. When you make this decision, use your common sense, use your heart, use your soul, remember that he was 14. Mr. Wippert would ask you to violate the law, you know, use your heart, and 39 times he reminded you that the defendant was a 14 year-old boy. We talked about the fact that it's gonna be difficult that your emotions come in, but you have to check them at the door. The law requires you to do that. There is absolutely no way that the facts of this case could ever be voluntary manslaughter, because no reasonable, average person would ever do what the defendant did. And it's sad, it is. It's tragic, it's awful. It's also a done deal. Was it a momentary act of panic or a cold The jury has been unable to reach a verdict after deliberating for days. In fact, the judge in this case has declared a mistrial just a short time ago. The jury is saying they could not come to an agreement, with seven jurors believing that he was guilty of voluntary manslaughter, five saying they believed he was guilty of murder. He's looking at life in prison, and that's not an option. We want a date, certain, that he can look at a calendar and say, on this date, I'm gonna get out. He doesn't wanna go through this process again, and none of us wanna go through this process again. But if we have to, then we have to. We'll have some talks with the District Attorney's Office, and see if there's any kind of resolution that all parties can live with. None of the jurors believe that this was a hate crime. Until another day. Until another day. This is what I poured for you, it's really good. Trader Joes. 3.99. Everybody's telling me about that. I'm telling you, it's so good, and they have Cab, they have Merlot, and they have Marbach. We bonded because it was so frustrating to hear things in court and, and there were times we were all crying in court, and we couldn't talk about it. I know. Brandon's an intelligent kid. Everybody said it. You know, I feel he's an intelligent... But I feel he's such a kid. He's immature! I feel... You know, when I looked at him, and he was sitting at that table, my heart broke for him, as a mom and a grandmother. None, not one of us thought that he was a white supremist. Never. Now. His assignment on Adolf Hitler. Could it have sparked his interest in that... Well, I wanna know a little more about this. He's 14, of course he did. He's a kid. And they love to draw at that age. Yes, they doodle and crosses and... and he's combining symbolism. I doodle now, especially when I'm not happy about what I'm hearing, and my hands go faster and faster. Where are the civil rights of the one being taunted by another person, who's cross They have to address that. It's very important. Clearly that wasn't addressed. No, it wasn't, and he had no one he could turn to, 'cause the school was so pro Larry King's civil rights. But where was Brandon's civil rights? It was the high heels. I think it was the make-up. The behavior... Because Marina... Yes. She had a girlfriend. They were told not to hold hands in school, so they stopped. She got it. She... Exactly. Larry didn't get it, and had he followed her example... We wouldn't be here today, no. Here's an extra. Yes. Thank you. We were supposed to not consider his age, which is very hard to do. That was the very first thought I had. He is so young. How can I, Rosalie, say that this kid needs to go to jail for the rest of his life? It would have to be so much more compelling in every way for me to even go down that avenue. I do not think it was first degree murder. However, it was premeditated. He had a plan to resolve this terrible problem, because no one was taking care of this problem. By murder, or just to maim him? We don't know. And then he's having second thoughts about doing it. But then, the green light when he says, "Hey, Larry, I hear you're changing your name to Letitia," to him that's a green light. He pulls out the gun and shoots him. Yeah. He was solving a problem. I picked a terrible jury. Juror number 11 wrote a letter to Judge Campbell. "It is a tragedy," and propaganda filled witch hunt. You all know this was not a hate crime. You all know the victim had a long history of deviant behavior. "Yes, I said deviant." As you can see, she cc'd Judge Campbell, me, Mr. Wippert, ABC 20/20, the Venturer, Star, Fox, LA and God. Everybody's so worried about Brandon. My God, he could get 52 to life. He shot a kid in the back of the head, point blank range, and premeditated and lied... Watched the back of his head for 20 minutes. I feel bad for Brandon, he made some bad mistakes, and he's a... he's a kid. Do you hold him accountable for the rest of his life? I'm not a judge but I can sure tell you that they made a murder victim the cause of his own murder. I've never seen that before. It was a seven-five split for manslaughter. How many of you believed Brandon should have been tried as an adult for first degree murder? Not one of you. The District attorney's Office refused to talk publicly, but said in a statement they believed Brandon is capable of killing again. And just this week, a California court gave the green light for DA to retry Brandon again for first degree murder as an adult. These jurors are now wearing Save Brandon bracelets too. They also told us they're raising money for Brandon's defense for the retrial. To see the jurors going on television with a Free Brandon bracelet and all that, are you gonna have that kind of compassion for a, admitted shooter if it was your kid? If you've got me walking through your door in the middle of the night to give you the one bit of news that you never ever, ever wanna hear. How are you gonna feel then? Are you gonna keep that bracelet on? This is my only tattoo. Obviously it's a show of support for Brandon. It felt like the right thing to do. I don't know how to explain it. I don't know that I will ever be able to express what it is about this kid that means so much to me. I just... I love him. He's just like one of my favorite people on the planet. His spirit, his energy and his... I don't know what it is, and I don't suppose I need to know what it is, but I just, I love him. I just, I think he's fantastic. Every time I look at it, I'm happy. There was a surprise plea deal tonight in the case of a gay junior high student shot to death by a classmate. How do you plead to that count? Guilty. He pleaded guilty to second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and use of a firearm, in the death of his classmate, Larry King. Well, he is gonna spend the next 21 years of his life in prison, no possibility of parole. The Ventura County DA's Office and attorneys for Brandon McInerney reached that deal in a Ventura County courtroom today. Brandon McInerney's mother left, weeping, also not talking to reporters. Some of the jurors in the first trial were here to support McInerney. And I was kind of shocked, like, 21 years, really? No chance of parole, really? It seems an awful long time for a kid who had no prior record, who didn't do any torture, kidnapping or any of the other things that I would consider to be appropriate for a 21-year sentence with no possibility of parole. There's more to the story than just what you see. I'm sorry. Just hanging back so I don't get down there, but I don't think I have anything at this time. I'm sorry. It just sucks. Larry doesn't get to come back in 21 years. I was just thinking about Larry. We're not gonna see him smile anymore, not gonna see him grow up. We ended up getting a resolution which was the best that we could have gotten. It was still way too high. It's still way too high. Everything we did in this was a fight, but at the end of the day, what really matters is Brandon is gonna get out. He has a date for his calendar that he can look forward to. I would next like to thank the people who have helped me get to this point, my family for keeping me motivated and always supporting me, my lawyers. Their hard work have put me in a position to put this diploma to work. Lastly, to the people I haven't mentioned. No, your support hasn't gone unnoticed. Thank you. He's sent a letter. First thing I got it in the mail. I did not open it. I was too scared. "It's cool you found out about my graduation. "I would have been an idiot not to try and get my diploma. "I can't tell you enough how sorry I am "for all the pain and guilt I've caused you, "but I need you to know, "none of this is your fault at all. "It is no one's fault but my own. "Please know that, "and I am definitely not angry with you, "and I never was. "I've moved on from what happened, "and I hope I can help you do the same. Love, Brandon." Graduates traditionally move their tassels from the right side to the left side of their graduation hats to indicate they have completed this phase of studies and now are ready to move on to the next. Move that tassel! When you ask me if Larry died in vain, the answer to that, with or without any trial is yes. He simply shouldn't have died. The trial of Brandon McInerney is neither here nor there when it comes to Larry's death. It highlights how intolerant we are, that intolerance is to such a degree that people bring it with them wherever they go, even in the jury box, and until we become a little more forgiving, a little more open-minded, I think, as a society, then tragic events like this will continue to be in vain. "God grew a garden and planted a seed "and every so often, had to pull out a weed. "He cared for the seed, so much. "He knew every hair on its head and such, "for this seed was a child who would love and laugh "but the love of a family he'd only get half, "who'd be a great child but adopted while young, "growing up with maybe your daughter or son. "He'd care for the animals, birds and bugs, "and if anyone was sad, he'd give them hugs. "He'd only use the kindest and softest tone, "but God knew a secret that to us was unknown. "This seed's life was short "and would die while still young, "but while still alive, this seed would have fun. "This seed's name was Larry, and he was my good friend, and he stayed like that all the way to the end."
