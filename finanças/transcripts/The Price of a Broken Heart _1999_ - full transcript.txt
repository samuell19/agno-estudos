OUR TOP STORY ON THIS 6:00 NEWS -- A JURY OF NINE WOMEN AND THREE MEN IN NEARBY BURLINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA, HAS SPENT THE AFTERNOON DELIBERATING IN THE CASE OFHUTELMYER vs COX. WE'RE EXPECTING A VERDICT ANYTIME NOW IN THIS LANDMARK CASE THAT HAS ATTRACTED NATIONAL ATTENTION. BURLINGTON RESIDENT DOROTHY HUTELMYER IS SUING LYNNE COX FOR ALIENATION OF AFFECTION, A LAW ON THE BOOKS IN HALF A DOZEN STATES, INCLUDING NORTH CAROLINA. THE QUESTION BEFORE THE JURY -- DID LYNNE COX DELIBERATELY SEEK TO DESTROY DOT HUTELMYER'S MARRIAGE BY PURSUING HER HUSBAND, JOSEPH? WE SPOKE WITH DOT HUTELMYER AT HER HOME IN BURLINGTON EARLIER THIS WEEK. I'M SUING BECAUSE I NEEDED TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF. I WANTED TO TELL THIS WOMAN THAT IT IS WRONG TO COME INTO MY MARRIAGE AND BREAK IT UP. HEY THERE, FAYE. LET'S SEE, I'LL HAVE A MEAT, TWO SIDES, SWEET TEA, AND SOME BISCUITS. DID YOU HEAR THAT, PHIL? MEAT, TWO SIDES, BISCUITS. WE'LL BE BACK LATER IF THERE ARE ANY LATE-BREAKING... WHAT YOU ALL LOOKING AT? WE'RE WAITING ON THE VERDICT IN THE DOT HUTELMYER CASE. WHO THE HECK IS DOT HUTELMYER? DIDN'T YOU SEE HER ON "OPRAH"? "OPRAH"? SHE'S SUING LYNNE COX FOR STEALING HER HUSBAND. YOU CAN SUE SOMEBODY FOR THAT? YEAH. YOU CAN IN NORTH CAROLINA. W-W-WAIT A MINUTE NOW. THE HUSBAND'S THE ONE WHO CHEATED. HE'S THE ONE OUGHT TO BE SUED. YOU CAN ONLY SUE HIM FOR ALIMONY. THIS LAW -- IT ONLY WORKS ON THE OTHER WOMAN. OR THE OTHER MAN. CAN I GET ANOTHER ONE? YEAH, TOO BAD DOT DIDN'T HANDLE IT THE WAY THEY DID IN THE OLD DAYS -- TAKE A NICE LITTLE RIFLE AND GUT-SHOT THE WOMAN WHO TOOK HER MAN. OH, PLEASE, BUBBA. THERE WOULDN'T BE A JURY IN THE WORLD THAT WOULD CONVICT HER. HOW YOU GONNA SUE SOMEBODY FOR A BROKEN HEART? NEXT THING, FOLKS WILL BE SUING OVER HURT FEELINGS. FINALLY, SOMEBODY WHO AGREES WITH ME. WHAT DO YOU CALL YOURSELF? I'M BURKE. HI, BURKE. I'M SUSAN. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO. THIS LAW IS GOING TO SET WOMEN BACK 200 YEARS, BACK TO THE TIME WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN. A LITTLE OUTDATED. WE'VE GOT ONE WOMAN -- THE VIRTUOUS VICTIM -- AND THE OTHER -- THE EVIL SPIDER LADY -- WHO LURES THE INNOCENT MALE INTO HER WEB. LOOK, I'M THE ONLY ONE OF ALL OF YOU THAT WAS IN THAT COURTROOM EVERY MINUTE OF THE TRIAL. TOOK TIME OFF TO DO IT. AND I AM TELLING YOU, I THINK LYNNE COX SET OUT TO STEAL DOT'S MAN. THAT GIRL IS TELLING THE TRUTH. WELL, AS MY MAMA USED TO SAY, "UNLESS YOU'RE THE THIRD HEAD ON THE PILLOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY WHO'S SLEEPING WITH WHO." BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT, BUT I CAN TELL YOU ALL THE EVIDENCE I HEARD PROVED THIS MUCH FOR SURE. FOR A REAL LONG TIME, JOE AND DOT WERE IN LOVE. THEY FELL IN LOVE ON A BLIND DATE. WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT ME? JUST THAT YOU TWO WERE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER. OH, I'M KIDDING. OH, HERE HE COMES -- THE ONE WITH SPENCE. HI, SPENCE. HEY, JOE. HI. THIS IS DOT. HI.HI. LET'S DANCE. PHYLLIS TELLS ME YOU'RE IN INSURANCE. I STARTED WORKING THE DAY AFTER I GRADUATED COLLEGE. IS THAT INTERESTING WORK? WELL, IT ISN'T FLASHY, BUT I THINK I CAN MAKE A CAREER OF IT.

THEN HOW COME YOU'RE ON THE ROAD EVERY NIGHT INSTEAD OF AT HOME WITH YOUR WIFE? THAT'S HOW I KEEP THE PASSION IN MY MARRIAGE. BUT WHAT IS A HAPPYMARRIAGE ANYWAY? WELL, TONS OF WITNESSES TESTIFIED AT HOW HAPPY THEY THOUGHT JOE AND DOT WERE. JOE WASN'T HAPPY, OR HE WOULDN'T HAVE GONE AND GOT HIS AFFECTIONS ALIENATED. I'LL TELL YOU HOW YOU ALIENATE SOMEONE'S AFFECTIONS... STEP BY LYING STEP. LYNNE, CAN YOU, UH, YOU KNOW, FILE -- YES, SIR. GUYS, WE ARE GOING TO CRESSWELL'S TO HAVE SOME EGGNOG. SHALL WE SAVE YOU A SEAT? JUST PUTTING THINGS TO BED FOR THE HOLIDAYS, BUT YEAH. MIKE? YEAH. LAURETTE, ORDER ME SOMETHING LONG, STRONG, AND HOLD THE DAIRY ON MINE. You think we should invite Lynne? She isJoe's secretary now. We could get to know her better. No. She does notlook like the partying type. ALL RIGHT, THEN. CAN I SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE? YES, SIR. LYNNE, I THINK IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO CALL ME JOE. YES, SIR, J-JOE. I MEAN, YES, JOE. I'D LIKE TO SEND FLOWERS TO MY WIFE. SHE WORKED SO HARD ON THE COVERED-DISH SOCIAL FOR THE BOYS' BASKETBALL LEAGUE. ROSES MAYBE, BUT NOT RED. I SAVE THOSE FOR ANNIVERSARIES. MAYBE THOSE LITTLE PINK ONES. WHAT ARE THOSE CALLED? THEY'RE CALLED SWEET -- SWEETHEART ROSES. SOMETHING WRONG? I'M SORRY. THIS IS VERY UNBUSINESSLIKE, AND I APOLOGIZE. I'M JUST GOING TO ORDER THE FLOWERS, AND -- NO, REALLY, REALLY, YOU KNOW. IS SOMETHING THE MATTER? I JUST WISH THAT MY HUSBAND WERE MORE... IT'S JUST SO NICE THAT YOU SEND YOUR WIFE GIFTS LIKE THAT. HE'S -- HE'S JUST NOT WARM AND AFFECTIONATE THE WAY THAT YOU SEEM TO BE WITH YOUR WIFE. AND HE'S GOT VERY STRONG BELIEFS ABOUT RELIGION. AND HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS OR GIVING GIFTS TO ME OR THE KIDS. SO IT'S JUST NOT THE GREATEST TIME OF YEAR FOR ME. LISTEN, I GOT AN IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU AND YOUR KIDS COME TO A LITTLE CHRISTMAS PARTY THAT DOT AND I ARE HAVING? YOUR KIDS COULD HELP DECORATE THE TREE. IT'S NOT THE SAME AS HAVING YOUR OWN, BUT IT'S SOMETHING. AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE LIBERTY OF GETTING EACH OF THEM A LITTLE GIFT. Really? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE -- THEY'RE GOING TO BE SO HAPPY. THANK YOU, SIR. I APPRECIATE IT. HI! LYNNE, I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. THANK YOU. LYNNE! THIS IS MY HUSBAND, CHIPPER COX. HI, CHIPPER. MERRY CHRISTMAS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW MATTHEW AND SARAH. HI, KIDS. BOYS, COME IN HERE. HEY, BOYS, COME ON, COME ON. MATTHEW, YOU GO TO SCHOOL WITH KEITH? MM-HMM. YEAH. I THINK WE'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND. YOU KNOW WE DON'T CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS THIS WAY. YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS, DIDN'T YOU? I KNEW THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME PRESENTS -- SHOULD I TALK TO HIM? NO, HE'LL BE FINE. YOU ENJOY YOUR PARTY. GO ON. Joe: WE ARE GOING TO DO FOR OUR NEXT SELECTION... "COME, ALL YE FAITHFUL." 1...2...3. ♪ OH, COME, ALL YE FAITHFUL ♪ JOYFUL AND TRIUMPHANT ♪ OH, COME, YE ♪ OH, COME, YE ♪ TO BETHLEHEM ♪ COME AND BEHOLD HIM ♪ BORN THE KING OF ANGELS ♪ OH, COME, LET US ADORE HIM ♪ OH, COME, LET US ADORE HIM ♪ OH, COME, LET US ADORE HIM ♪ CHRIST, THE LORD WHOO! HEY, HON. WHERE'S THE BOYS? UPSTAIRS. DID YOU HAVE A ROUGH DAY? A LOT OF POLICIES ON LONG HAUL. THAT'S ALL. ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO. OH, THAT'S SIMPLE. I AM THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE BURLINGTON BRANCH OF WINWOOD INSURANCE. JOE! YEAH! THAT'S INCREDIBLE! BOYS! LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO GET STARTED RIGHT AWAY AND FIND US A BIGGER HOUSE TO LIVE IN. SOMETHING WHITE, MAYBE, WITH A LINCOLN BEDROOM? SOMETHING LIKE THAT! YEAH! OH, HONEY, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. WELL, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU, DOT. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. WHAT? GUESS WHO'S THE NEW PRESIDENT OF WINWOOD INSURANCE? WHOO!YAY! THAT IS SO AWESOME! I KNOW, I KNOW! OH, HERE HE COMES. HERE HE COMES! THANK YOU! Man: DON'T FORGET TO WRITE! Man #2: NO MORE "JOE"! LYNNE? WOW! CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR PROMOTION. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING ME ON AS YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. THAT'S QUITE A CHANGE. WHAT HAPPENED? CHIPPER AND I SEPARATED. DON'T SAY, "SORRY." EVERYBODY SAYS, "SORRY." AND THE TRUTH IS IT'S REALLY THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. SO IT'S TIME FOR A NEW YOU? WELL, I WENT FROM PLEASING MY PARENTS TO PLEASING CHIPPER. AND I JUST THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT MYSELF. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GET STARTED. I AM READY, WILLING, AND ABLE, MR. PRESIDENT. HMM. AREN'T YOU GUYS GOING TO GIVE HIM HIS CARD? LYNNE COX IS IN THERE. BOY, IS SHE IN THERE. WHO CARES IF LYNNE COX IS SITTING IN THERE? YOU SHOULD SEE HOWSHE'S SITTING. LYNNE COX IS IN HIS OFFICE? DID YOU SEE HER WHEN SHE WALKED IN THIS MORNING? I WOULDN'T HAVE RECOGNIZED HER IN A MILLION YEARS IF SHE HADN'T TALKED RIGHT TO ME. SHE'S HAD A LITTLE CHEMICAL ASSISTANCE WITH HER HAIR COLOR. THAT SKIRT ISN'T 3 INCHES LONGER THAN HER JACKET. SKORT. WHAT? IT'S NOT A SKIRT. IT'S A SKORT -- HALF SKIRT, HALF SHORTS. DON'T WE HAVE A DRESS CODE IN THIS OFFICE? GOD, I HOPE NOT. HEY! OH, HI. OH, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU PICKING ME UP. I KNOW YOU MUST BE PRESSED FOR TIME WITH YOUR RECENT PROMOTION AND ALL. I HATE DOING LONG DRIVES ALONE TO ALL THESE OUT-OF-TOWN MEETINGS. THIS WAY WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE OFFICE PARTICIPATION IN THE MARCH OF DIMES THING BEFORE WE GET THERE. OKAY. OKAY. I CAN TAKE SOME NOTES WHILE WE'RE IN THE CAR. OH, HEY, RELAX. NOT -- NOT JUST RIGHT THIS SECOND. WE GOT A 4-HOUR DRIVE. YOU SURE? YEAH. LET'S GO. OKAY, I'M GONNA WATCH ERIC'S GAME, AND THAT SHOULD BE OVER ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS YOUR LESSON. BUT IF I'M LATE, YOU WAIT ON THE INSIDE FOR ME, AND THAT WAY I DON'T WORRY. MOM, WHEN WILL DAD BE BACK? HONEY, HE'LL BE BACK LATE TOMORROW AFTERNOON. AND I KNOW HE HATES TO MISS YOUR GAME, BUT I'LL JUST HAVE TO SCREAM EXTRA LOUD! I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY I AM TO BE ON MY OWN. I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD ON MY KIDS, GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN US, I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN LIVING IN AN UNHAPPY HOUSEHOLD. I SHOULD HAVE ENDED THIS THING A LONG TIME AGO. IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU AVOID SOMETHING. IT SEEMS SO SCARY -- THE ANTICIPATION. THEN, WHEN IT FINALLY HAPPENS, IT'S SUCH A RELIEF. I MEAN, YOU WONDER WHY YOU WERE SCARED AT ALL. YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, HAVING THE PERFECT MARRIAGE AND ALL. MY MARRIAGE ISN'T PERFECT. WHAT PROBLEMS COULD YOU AND DOT POSSIBLY HAVE? OH, NOTHING MUCH. I GUESS WE'RE BOTH A LITTLE OVERLY INVOLVED WITH THE KIDS. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR JUST THE TWO OF US. THAT WILL CHANGE ONCE THE BOYS GET OLDER. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. OF COURSE, SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES CENTER ON THEIR KIDS FIND THAT WHEN THEIR KIDS LEAVE, THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON ANYMORE. DOT AND I HAVE A LOT IN COMMON ASIDE FROM THE KIDS. SHE UNDERSTANDS YOUR WORK, HUH? WELL, SEE, THAT'S KIND OF A RUNNING JOKE WITH US. SHE NEVER DID UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT I DO. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. THAT IS EXACTLY HOW IT WAS WITH ME AND CHIPPER. WE COULDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY WORK-RELATED THINGS, NOT THE WAY THAT YOU AND I TALK. WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE. WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. DOT AND I... UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD THAT YOU CAN TALK TO DOT. AND I MEAN, MAYBE, WHO KNOWS, MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WORK THINGS OUT. HOPE YOU HAVE MORE LUCK THAN CHIPPER AND I DID. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT A MARRIAGE WITH PROBLEMS IS LIKE STALE BREAD. YOU JUST CAN'T MAKE IT FRESH AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THEY'RE WRONG. ...SAY THEY WENT TO THE FAR EAST LOOKING FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. A CONTINGENT OF BUSINESS LEADERS... YOU THINK THEY'LL REACH A VERDICT TODAY? I JUST COULDN'T SLEEP TONIGHT NOT KNOWING HOW THIS IS GOING TO TURN OUT. OH, LET'S BE HONEST. WE'RE NOT CURIOUS ABOUT THIS CASE BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE WHO'S GUILTY. ONCE A LAWYER, ALWAYS A LAWYER. THE REASON WE'RE INTERESTED AND THE REASON THE GOSSIP FLEW IS BECAUSE OF A LITTLE 3-LETTER WORD SPELLED S-E-X. WHAT IS IT WITH EVERYBODY'S OBSESSION WITH EVERYBODY ELSE'S SEX LIFE? OH, SUSAN, COME ON! WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT ELVIS WOULDN'T SLEEP WITH WOMEN WHO HAD KIDS? OR THAT FRANK GIFFORD COULD BE SEDUCED BY A FORMER FLIGHT ATTENDANT? ME! I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. KATHIE LEE DIDN'T SUE THE WOMAN WHO SEDUCED FRANK. NO ALIENATION OF AFFECTION CASE AIMED AT HER, RIGHT? I MEAN, HOW MUCH AFFECTION COULD THERE HAVE BEEN TO ALIENATE BETWEEN JOE AND DOT? YOU SAID IT YOURSELF, FAYE. THEY HADN'T HAD SEX FOR YEARS. THERE'S MORE TO MARRIAGE THAN SEX. YOU CAN HAVE MARRIAGE AND AFFECTION WITHOUT SEX. YOU COULD,BUT WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD YOU WANT TO? I THINK IF THERE'S NO SEX, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATION THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. WHO SAID THERE WAS NO SEX? HIS STORY AND HER STORY ARE PRETTY DIFFERENT ON THAT ISSUE. WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO MEN AND WOMEN AND SEX, AREN'T THE STORIES ALWAYS DIFFERENT? WHAT WAS YOUR SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP LIKE UP UNTIL THE EARLY '90s? I WOULD SAY WE HAD A GOOD SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP. UM, WE HAD SEX ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK. NOW, AT SOME POINT, DID THAT EVER CHANGE? YES, AROUND, UM, THE EARLY '90s -- '92ish -- I NOTICED THAT JOE JUST DIDN'T SEEM AS INTERESTED IN HAVING SEX. OKAY. AND HAD ANYTHING HAPPENED AROUND THAT TIME WITH RESPECT TO HIS JOB? YES, HE GOT PROMOTED TO PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY. DO YOU REMEMBER THE KIND OF RESPONSES YOU WERE GETTING FROM HIM ABOUT SEX? WELL, HE -- HE WOULD, UM -- HE WOULD JUST TURN OVER AND SAY, "I'M NOT INTERESTED." AND SOMETIMES I WOULD WAKE HIM UP, AND HE'D SAY, "OH, YOU WOKE ME UP. NOW I WON'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP." THAT KIND OF A THING. WHAT'S THE MATTER, HONEY? TOUGH DAY AT WORK. RUMORS ARE FLYING THAT WE MAY GET BOUGHT. I'M NOT SURE HOW SECURE MY JOB IS. YOU'RE JUST A WORRIER. HMM. I THINK I'M GOING TO SLEEP ON THE SOFA. SINCE WHEN IS THAT SOMETHING HUSBANDS VOLUNTEER FOR? I'M TIRED. MY HEAD IS SPINNING. I DON'T WANT TO TOSS AND TURN AND KEEP YOU UP. I LOVE YOU. Dot: AND SOMETIMES WHEN I WAS REAL LONELY, I'D GO DOWN AND LAY BY HIM ON THE COUCH. BUT IT WAS KIND OF NARROW. AND THE THING WAS, I FELT I REALLY UNDERSTOOD IF THAT'S THE WAY HE WAS, IT WAS OKAY WITH ME. I WAS HIS WIFE. I WAS DEVOTED TO HIM. I WANTED TO SUPPORT HIM. I FIGURED I HAD THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH HIM, AND IF THAT'S HOW HE WANTED IT, THAT WAS OKAY WITH ME. I LOVED HIM JUST THE WAY HE WAS. TELL THE JURY WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS LIKE WITH YOUR WIFE IN THE EARLY YEARS OF YOUR MARRIAGE. IT WAS -- IT WAS GOOD. IT WAS A MARRIAGE WHERE WE BOTH GOT ALONG WITH EACH OTHER. WE BOTH LIKED DOING A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS. IN THE '80s, OUR CHILDREN WERE BORN, AND THAT TAKES UP A LOT OF YOUR TIME. DID THE CHANGE OCCUR IN THE MID-'80s OR LATER? MORE TOWARD THE LATE '80s, WHEN IT APPEARED THAT... THAT DOT WASN'T INTERESTED IN ME ANYMORE AND ALL OF HER FOCUS WAS ON THE CHILDREN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WHEN WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER, WE REALLY DIDN'T. IF I GOT CLOSE, IT WAS, I WAS CONFINING HER OR SMOTHERING HER. IT WAS TOO HOT, OR IT WAS TOO COLD, OR SHE WAS TOO TIRED. Is there any truth to that? My gosh, we were married for 18 years. I must have said no sometimes, but it wasn't like that! NOW, WOULD YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE FOR THE COURT, THE JURY, WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS LIKE WITH YOUR WIFE, DOT HUTELMYER, IN THE EARLY '90s? THERE WAS VERY LITTLE PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP. SHE MADE AN ATTEMPT ON THE NIGHT SHE TOOK ME TO A HOTEL FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY. SHE SURPRISED ME FOR OUR 14th ANNIVERSARY. OFFICIALLY UNPACKED. EVERYTHING IS IN ITS PLACE. WOW! BABYSITTER FOR THE BOYS. EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER. REALLY? YOU DID THAT? I AM SURPRISED. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY. Thank you. WELL... LOOK AT THAT PAY-PER-VIEW! OH, THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. THAT'S $7. THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED, HONEY. YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT. DO YOU WANT SOME CHAMPAGNE? UM...YEAH! OH, DEAR, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO OPEN THAT OUTSIDE, OR WE MIGHT GET IT ALL OVER THE ROOM. IT'S HOT IN HERE, DON'T YOU THINK? I WONDER WHERE THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL IS. DOT! DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH YOUR WIFE THAT NIGHT? NO, SIR. I DID NOT. WHENEVER WE WENT AWAY, WE MADE LOVE BEFORE WE UNPACKED. ♪ HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO US IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME. YEAH. AND I RENTED THE ROOM FOR THE NIGHT JUST FOR THE TWO OF US. AND I GOT THE BOYS A SITTER. AND I DIDN'T DO THAT SO WE COULD GET A $5 BAG OF CHIPS FROM THE MINI BAR. OH, YEAH? DID YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE SEX THAT NIGHT? YES. YES, WE DID. HE SAYS THEY DIDN'T HAVE SEX. SHE SAYS THEY DID. THEY BOTH CAN'T BE TELLING THE TRUTH. MAYBE HE STARTED HAVING SEX WITH LYNNE BECAUSE DOT STOPPED HAVING SEX WITH HIM. THAT'S WHAT THE JURY HAS TO DECIDE -- WHO SEDUCED WHO. WHOM. HEY, HOLD ON A SECOND. HERE IT IS. ALTHOUGH DINNER HAS BEEN SENT IN, INDICATING AN EXTENDED SESSION... Burke: WELL, NO NEWS IS NONEWS. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHO STOPPED SLEEPING WITH WHO, WHAT, WHERE, OR WHEN. BUT ACCORDING TO THE OFFICE WORKERS THAT TESTIFIED FOR DOT, IT WAS THE MAIN TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AT WINWOOD. JOE, I NEED YOU TO LOOK THESE OVER AND APPROVE THEM. I'M GOING TO LUNCH. WELL, SEE, I REALLY NEED THEM APPROVED BADLY. JUST PUT THEM ON MY DESK. WELL, NO, THAT WOULD BE AFTER LUNCH. I NEED THE STUFF BEFORE LUNCH, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE...NOW. 5...4...3... I'M GOING TO LUNCH, GLORIA. MM-HMM. 3...2...1...BINGO. Mike: SO, YOU THINK THEY'RE DOING IT YET? I BET JOE'S GREAT IN BED. HE'S GOT THAT BURNING LOOK. THAT'S JUST INDIGESTION ABOUT THE TAKEOVER RUMORS. THE ONLY THING LYNNE COX IS BURNING UP OVER IS HIS $200,000 SALARY. YOU THINK THEY TALK BUSINESS WHILE THEY'RE...DOING IT? MAYBE TALKING BUSINESS ISIT FOR THEM. KATIE, KIDNAP A CLUE, HONEY. WELL, FOR SOME PEOPLE IT IS. NOT A WHOLE LOT OF BUSINESS GOING ON THERE. WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED JOE WOULD BE A SUCKER FOR A SHORT SKIRT? DO YOU KNOW ROBIN BOONE? YES. ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT LIBBY SMITH, VICKIE MINOR, SARAH LITTLE, SHERRY McKEEL, EVELYN DAYE? YES, THEY'RE ALL COWORKERS. OKAY. AND THEY ALL WORE SKIRTS THAT WERE ABOUT AS SHORT AS, OR THE SAME AS, THE SKIRTS MS. COX, NOW HUTELMYER, WORE FROM TIME TO TIME. DIDN'T THEY? I SUPPOSE SO, YES. OKAY. NOW THIS IS A STRANGE QUESTION. DID ANYBODY ELSE -- DID ANY OF THE WOMEN THERE -- DID THEY EVER DO ANYTHING TO THEIR HAIR? LIKE -- LIKE COLOR IT? MM-HMM. YES, I'M SURE THEY DID. HUMAN NATURE BEING WHAT IT IS. BEING WHAT IT IS. I WAS EMPLOYED WITH WINWOOD INSURANCE, WHERE JOE WAS PRESIDENT. DO YOU REMEMBER AN OCCASION DRIVING BY THE WINWOOD OFFICES IN THE EVENING ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO? YES, I DO. IT WAS AROUND 8:00, 8:30 AT NIGHT, AND JOE AND LYNNE'S CARS WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE. OH, MY GOD! DO YOU REMEMBER A PARTICULAR RECEPTION AT A CONFERENCE YOU AND YOUR COWORKERS ATTENDED? YES, I DO. IT WAS IN GREENSBORO. I THINK IT WAS JULY BECAUSE I REMEMBER HOW HOT IT WAS. THE LOSS OF THE ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT HURTS, BUT I DON'T SEE IT AS A LONG-TERM PROBLEM. AS LONG AS WE KEEP WRITING, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. DO YOU REMEMBER PUTTING YOUR HAND IN JOE HUTELMYER'S GLASS? I RECALL REACHING IN AND TAKING ICE OUT OF A GLASS, BUT I ALSO RECALL THERE WERE ABOUT THREE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND US DOING THE SAME THING. DID THEY ALL GET THEIR HANDS IN THERE AT THE SAME TIME? I DON'T THINK SO. I'LL GET A BETTER IDEA WHERE WE ARE WHEN I MEET WITH THE BIG GUYS THIS WEEKEND. YOU GOT ANOTHER MEETING, HUH? I DON'T SEE HOW YOU STAND ALL THAT TRAVELING, BOY. IF I WAS AWAY FROM MY WIFE THAT LONG, WHOO! YOU WERE SECRETARY TO DON SANGREN, THE PRESIDENT PRIOR TO JOE HUTELMYER, FOR HOW LONG? 17 YEARS. DID YOU EVER GO OUT OF STATE ON COMPANY BUSINESS? NO, SIR. DID YOU EVER TRAVEL TO ANY CONVENTIONS WITH MR. SANGREN? NO, SIR. DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING, WITH RESPECT TO LYNNE, WHEN MR. HUTELMYER WOULD BE OUT OF TOWN? YES, THEY TRAVELED THE SAME TIMES. DO YOU THINK ANYBODY SUSPECTED THAT I WAS HERE WITH YOU? I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK YOU LIKE THIS. I THINK YOU LIKE LIVING DANGEROUSLY, DON'T YOU? Yeah. HEY, LISTEN, THAT MEETING STARTS IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES! TAKE ME WITH YOU. HUH? TAKE ME WITH YOU, HUH? THIS MEETING IS FOR TOP PRODUCERS ONLY. LOOK, I FEEL TERRIBLE MAKING YOU SNEAK AROUND LIKE THIS, BUT I JUST COULD NOT COME UP WITH A PLAUSIBLE REASON FOR YOU TO BE HERE. HOW ABOUT THAT YOU LOVE ME? IS THAT A PLAUSIBLE REASON? LYNNE, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. YOU... I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN GO ON LIKE THIS. I'M NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER. I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE. I'M NOT GOING TO BE MARRIED FOREVER. EVENTUALLY MY KIDS ARE GOING TO MOVE OUT. AND MINE WILL, TOO, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE WHEN THEY DO. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, JOE. YOU -- YOU CAN'T BE SNEAKING AROUND IN HOTEL ROOMS WITH ME AND THEN RUN BACK TO YOUR REAL LIFE. I GOT AN APARTMENT -- A RENTED ONE -- FOR MYSELF, AS SORT OF A FIRST STEP TOWARDS MOVING OUT. I WAS GOING TO SURPRISE YOU. LOOK, I'LL CALL DOT AND TELL HER THE TRIP WAS EXTENDED BY A DAY, OKAY? OKAY, BABY? MMM. Yeah. HELLO? Dot? HI, HONEY! IT'S YOUR DAD. SETTLE DOWN. HI. WE MISS YOU. YOU SHOULD SEE ERIC'S COSTUME FOR THE SCHOOL PLAY TOMORROW NIGHT. I, uh -- I can't be there. YOU CAN'T? He'll be so disappointed. I JUST DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT, DOT. UH, HEY, CAN I TALK TO THE KIDS? Uh-huh, just a minute. IT'S YOUR DAD. HE HAS TO WORK TOMORROW. HELLO? Hey, buddy! How are you? ALL RIGHT. MISS YOU. Oh, I miss you, too. LISTEN, I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO YOUR PLAY. I love you, Joe. OKAY. WELL, UM, I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT THEN. OKAY. 'BYE. 'BYE. I love you. I LOVE YOU, TOO. 'BYE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WE EVEN GOT CABLE. CONGRATULATIONS, MR. HUTELMYER. I'M PROUD OF YOU. I ORDERED AN EXTRA SET OF KEYS FOR YOU, AND THE MICROWAVE ARRIVES ON FRIDAY. WHERE'S THE PHONE? I BETTER CALL CHIPPER AND MAKE SURE HE'S GOING TO PICK UP THE KIDS. UH, I HADN'T GOT AROUND TO THAT YET. OH. WELL, LET'S HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO CALL 911. THANK YOU. I LOVE IT. Burke: OF COURSE HE DIDN'T PUT A PHONE IN. 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT LYNNE CHECKING TO SEE IF HE WAS THERE AT NIGHT. I DON'T THINK HE EVER DID MOVE OUT OF HIS HOUSE. THE NIGHTS HE SPENT THERE, HE JUST TOLD DOT HE WAS OUT OF TOWN. THAT'S IF HE EVER TOLD LYNNE HE WAS SEPARATED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I MEAN, MAYBE THAT APARTMENT WAS A LITTLE LOVE NEST IS ALL. WHY ARE WE ALL SO READY TO BLAME THE WOMAN? HE WAS LYNNE'S BOSS, RIGHT? HE WAS THE ONE IN THE POWER AND ALL THE CONTROL. MAYBE HE INSISTED SHE GO ON ALL THOSE BUSINESS TRIPS. MAYBE HE DANGLED THOSE PROMOTIONS IN FRONT OF HER TO GET HER TO GO TO BED WITH HIM. WE BLAME THE WOMAN, AND HE'S OFF THE HOOK, RIGHT? DO YOU GUYS EVEN GET WHAT THIS LAW WAS INTENDED FOR? IT WAS WRITTEN ABOUT 200 YEARS AGO WHEN A WOMAN WAS CONSIDERED A MAN'S PROPERTY, LIKE A TRACTOR OR A HORSE. IT WAS WRITTEN SO THAT A MAN COULD RECLAIM HIS WIFE -- HIS PROPERTY -- IF SHE RAN OFF WITH ANOTHER MAN. DO YOU EVER TAKE A BREATH? WELL, WHATEVER IT WAS JOE TOLD LYNNE, SEEMS LIKE IT ALL FELL APART BY THANKSGIVING. IN FACT, EVERY THANKSGIVING. ALL TOGETHER AS A TEAM! OH, MY GOD! LOOK AT IT! NOW THAT IS A HANDSOME BIRD. WHERE'S THE BREAD? BOYS? HE FORGOT IT. NO, YOUDID. NOW, NOW. SETTLE DOWN. I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE JOE HOME WITH US. HE'S BEEN WORKING SO HARD, WE'VE BARELY SEEN HIM ALL YEAR. HE GETS HOME JUST IN TIME TO TUCK THE BOYS IN. HE GOES RIGHT BACK TO THE OFFICE. I WANTED HIM TO SEE WHAT HE'S BEEN MISSING. COULD YOU SAY THE GRACE? SURE. WE THANK GOD FOR ALL THE BLESSINGS THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THIS FAMILY. WE THANK GOD FOR OUR PARENTS, OUR CHILDREN, OUR FRIENDS, OUR MATES. AMEN. Eric: CAN WE EAT? YEAH, LET'S EAT. HAPPY THANKSGIVING, EVERYONE. Joe: COULD YOU PASS THOSE ROLLS? MY GOODNESS, THEY LOOK DELICIOUS! OKAY, STOP SQUIRMING AROUND. YOU PACK YOUR TOOTHBRUSH? YEAH, MOM. WHAT IF DAD MAKES US EAT HIS RHUBARB PIE? TELL HIM YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO IT, OKAY? HAVE A GOOD THANKSGIVING. I LOVE YOU, MOM. I LOVE YOU, TOO. I'M SHOOTING, I'M DRIVING. AAH! WHOO! WHOO! WAIT. I SHOT IT IN. COME ON. NO! HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YAY! WHOO! WHOO! SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE NONE OF YOU ARE GONNA BE PICKED UP BY THE NBA, LET'S DO HOMEWORK. HOMEWORK! Joe: OH, BOY, HOMEWORK! YEAH, WE BEAT DAD. WHOO! HEY! AHH! UH, I HAVE TO HEAD BACK TO THE OFFICE FOR A COUPLE HOURS. JOE, THAT'S THE THIRD NIGHT THIS WEEK. WE'RE LOOKING AT MOVING OUT OF THE WINWOOD BUILDING INTO THE INTEGON BUILDING, AND I HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME COST PROJECTIONS. DO YOU WANT ME TO WAIT UP, AND WE CAN WATCH A MOVIE? I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE. IF YOU'RE HAVING FUN IN THERE, YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE! HOMEWORK! WELL... I MISS YOU, JOE. UH, I CHANGED MY MIND. YOU'RE GONNA STAY? I CAN'T. BUT PICK OUT A MOVIE, AND WE'LL WATCH SOME OF IT WHEN I GET BACK. OKAY. OKAY. LYNNE? HMM? YOU AWAKE? UNH-UNH. WHAT'S GOING ON? CHRISTMAS IS COMING. IT'LL DO THAT EVERY YEAR, SWEETIE. I MADE A MISTAKE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M GIVING UP THIS APARTMENT. I JUST CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF BEING WITHOUT MY BOYS. OH, REALLY? Yeah. I'm sorry. I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT I'M GOING TO SIT AROUND HERE WAITING FOR YOU TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. FROM NOVEMBER OF EVERY YEAR UNTIL AFTER NEW YEAR'S, MR. HUTELMYER AND I DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER BECAUSE HE ALWAYS BROKE MY HEART BY TELLING ME THAT HE WAS GOING BACK TO HIS WIFE BECAUSE THE HOLIDAYS WERE THERE, AND HE WANTED TO BE WITH HIS -- WITH HIS SONS. AND DURING THAT TIME, MR. HUTELMYER AND I DID NOT SEE EACH OTHER. I MEAN, OTHER THAN WHEN WE HAD TO SEE EACH OTHER AT THE OFFICE. BUT YOU WENT OVER TO THE COMPANY CHRISTMAS PARTY IN '94, DID YOU NOT? YES, WITH LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE. AND DOROTHY HUTELMYER WAS THERE WITH HER HUSBAND. YES. BY THE TIME OF THE CHRISTMAS PARTY, HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME THAT HE'D MOVED BACK, THAT HE WAS LIVING WITH HER AGAIN. HO, HO, HO! GLORIA PAULSEN, COME ON DOWN! YAY! WHOO!WHOO! LYNNE COX. DO WE HAVE A LYNNE COX? Man: MERRY CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, SANTA. JOE, DON'T FORGET THE KIDS. They've been so patient. Oh. HO, HO, HO! COME ON, GATHER AROUND, GATHER AROUND. HERE YOU GO! COME ON. LYNNE. MIKE. WHERE'S YOUR CHRISTMAS SPIRIT? CHILDREN, COME ON! LYNNE? YES, SIR? COULD YOU BRING ME THE HUXTABLE FILE, PLEASE? THANK YOU. UM... HOW WAS YOUR HOLIDAYS? IS THERE SOME OFFICE BUSINESS THAT YOU WANTED TO DISCUSS WITH ME? PLEASE, OPEN IT. LYNNE, I MADE A MISTAKE. I NEED YOU. I WAS MISERABLE OVER CHRISTMAS. I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU EVERY SECOND. I, UH -- I GOT THE APARTMENT BACK, AND I'M GOING TO SEE AN ATTORNEY. I'M GOING TO GET A SEPARATION AGREEMENT. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD MEET ME TONIGHT AFTER WORK AT THE APARTMENT? THEY'RE KISSING! WHO? JOE AND LYNNE. WHAT'S GOING ON, GIRLS? GLORIA JUST SAW JOE AND LYNNE KISSING IN THE OFFICE. I THINK WE SHOULD FINALLY TELL HIS WIFE. ME, TOO. JOE IS OUR PAYCHECK. YOU REALIZE HOW FAST WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB IF WE TALK? I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP OUR MOUTHS SHUT. SOMETHING JUICY'S GOING DOWN HERE. I CAN FEEL IT. WHO'S DOING IT WITH WHO? JOE AND LYNNE. WE'RE JUST GUESSING ON THAT. HELLO! I JUST SAW THEM KISSING. HERE THEY COME! Joe: OKAY, EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP. GATHER AROUND. COME ON, COME ON. I HAVE A COUPLE PROMOTIONS I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE. MIKE, HERE, WILL BE OUR NEW HEAD OF SALES. WHOO! MIKE, THAT'S GREAT! WAY TO GO, MIKE! AND ANOTHER PROMOTION FOR LYNNE COX. SHE WILL GO FROM DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES TO V.P. OF COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS. OKAY, EVERYBODY, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. LAURETTE'S BEEN HERE 20 YEARS. SHE SHOULD HAVE THAT JOB. LYNNE IS THE ONLY V.P. I KNOW THAT STILL ANSWERS HER BOSS'S PHONE. OKAY, NOW I THINK WE COULD CALL THE HOME OFFICE AND LET THEM IN ON THESE SHENANIGANS. AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO TELL THEM? THAT WE CAN'T DO OUR WORK BECAUSE WE'RE SPECULATING ABOUT THE BOSS'S LIBIDO? NO, I THINK I'LL KEEP MY JOB, THANK YOU. POOR DOT. IN THE 20-SOME YEARS YOU WORKED THERE, ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY FEMALE WITH ONLY A HIGH-SCHOOL DEGREE GOING UP AS QUICKLY AS MS. COX? NO, SIR. YOU WERE THE LEAD PHOTOGRAPH AND INTERVIEW IN A MAGAZINE ARTICLE, WERE YOU NOT? AN ARTICLE THAT DEALT WITH THE RISE OF WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE. YES, I WAS. IS THIS YOU? YES, IT IS. WELL, YOU'RE NOT WEARING GLASSES THERE, ARE YOU? I WAS WEARING MY CONTACTS AT THE TIME. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DISTANCE VISION WHEN I WEAR CONTACTS. WOULD YOU HOLD THIS UP SO THE JURY CAN SEE HOW YOU APPEARED IN THE OFFICE AND HOW YOU ARE DRESSING HERE FOR THIS TRIAL? EXCUSE ME? IF YOU WOULD, JUST COME DOWN SO THE JURY CAN SEE HOW YOU WERE DRESSING AT THE OFFICE, AS OPPOSED TO HOW YOU ARE DRESSED FOR THIS TRIAL. YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT. OBJECTION OVERRULED. DIDN'T I TELL YOU LYNNE WAS PLAYING THAT JURY FOR A FOOL? NOT WEARING HER CONTACT LENS. WHAT THE HECK DID SHE TAKE THEM FOR? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HER TO DO -- SHOW UP IN COURT WITH FISHNET STOCKINGS, A PUSH-UP BRA, AND STILETTOS? IF THE STILETTO FITS. I WISH YOU ALL WOULD GET OFF LYNNE. WHAT ABOUT JOE? Faye: DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED. I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF MAN CALLS HIS WIFE, TELLS HER HE'S OFF ON A BUSINESS TRIP, DOESN'T COME HOME FOR DAYS, AND THEN, FINALLY DROPS BY JUST TO SEND HER OFF SO HE CAN PLAY HOUSE WITH LYNNE? Dot: JOE? YEAH? BILLS ARE ON THE SIDEBOARD. MUST BE PAID! DON'T FORGET. LET'S GO, BOYS! COME ON, GUYS. LET'S GO. GOT EVERYTHING? HEY, LISTEN. HEY, HEY, HEY! PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR MOM. ALL RIGHT? SEE YA, DAD. YOU'RE A SWEETIE. GO ON. HONEY, MY PARENTS ARE REALLY GONNA MISS YOU. AND WHO'S DAD GONNA COMPLAIN TO ABOUT MOM'S COOKING? YOU THINK THE BOYS ARE OLD ENOUGH FOR THAT? HONEY, DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD COME DOWN AND JUST JOIN US FOR THE WEEKEND? OH, I'D LOVE TO. I AM SO SWAMPED AT WORK. I JUST CAN'T. I MADE A MEAT LOAF, AND THERE'S A BIG BOWL OF POTATO SALAD IN THE REFRIGERATOR. AND FRIED CHICKEN, OKAY? NO APPLAUSE. JUST THROW MONEY. 'BYE. BYE-BYE. HAVE FUN. MAY I SPEAK TO LAURETTE, PLEASE? HEY, BABE, IT'S ME. LISTEN TO THIS. JOE HUTELMYER AND LYNNE COX JUST LEFT HIS HOUSE TOGETHER. AND I THINK SHE MUST HAVE SPENT THE NIGHT THERE, BECAUSE HIS WAS THE ONLY CAR THERE. DOT AND THE KIDS ARE AT HER MOM'S. TALK ABOUT NERVE! DOT'S BACK IS TURNED FOR ONE SECOND. RAE ANN KELLY LIVES NEXT DOOR TO LYNNE. AND WHEN SHE WAS AT HOME ALL THAT TIME WITH THAT CANCER, SHE WAS WATCHING OUT THE WINDOW. AND SHE SAID SHE SAW JOE'S CAR THERE ALMOST EVERY NIGHT. AND... And sometimes until the morning. JOE HUTELMYER'S A $200,000-A-YEAR GUY. HE CAN'T BE DUMB ENOUGH JUST TO PARK HIS CAR RIGHT OUT FRONT OF LYNNE'S HOUSE AT NIGHT IN PLAIN SIGHT. NOT THAT IT'S ANY OF MY BUSINESS. AND WE ALL KNOW WE'RE NOT TO LIE, TO STEAL, TO KILL. BUT TODAY I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER SINS -- THE ONES WE DON'TCALL SINS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT GOSSIP. GOSSIP IS AN EVIL. IF SOMEONE COMES TO YOU WITH GOSSIP ABOUT ANOTHER... Do you think she has any idea? Clueless. ...AND DO NOT FAN THE FLAMES BY REPEATING IT. PLEASE REMEMBER -- YOU HAVE THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN YOUR TONGUE. YOU CAN SPEAK LIFE, OR YOU CAN SPEAK DEATH. AMEN. I heard his car is in Lynne's driveway till 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. I heard it was there till the morning. WHEN WE GOSSIP, WE HURT BOTH THOSE WE GOSSIP ABOUT AND OURSELVES. That's the best sermon I ever heard. THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS. THERE'S ONLY 12 SHOPPING DAYS LEFT TILL CHRISTMAS. SO, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GET YOU FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY, HONEY? WHAT'S WRONG? I DON'T KNOW. MY KIDS, THE HOLIDAYS -- JUST REALLY A HARD TIME FOR ME. I THINK THAT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU KEEP PROLONGING THE AGONY. YOU JUST GOT TO TELL DOT THAT YOU WANT A DIVORCE AND SPEND THE HOLIDAYS WITH ME. MY KIDS. YEAH, I GOT KIDS, TOO. AND EVERY TIME I COME OVER HERE TO BE WITH YOU, I HAVE TO PAWN THEM OFF ON CHIPPER OR MY NEIGHBOR OR SOMEONE. IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME, EITHER, BUT KIDS SURVIVE DIVORCE, JOE. MINE DID, AND YOURS WILL, TOO. I-I JUST REALLY FEEL THAT I NEED TO SEE MY KIDS OVER THE HOLIDAY. YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME, I KNOW, AND I DON'T BLAME YOU. OH, GOD! I-I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS TO ME THREE YEARS IN A ROW! I'M SORRY. DOT? KIDS? DOT? SURPRISE!SURPRISE!SURPRISE! HEY, JOE! I FLEW THEM IN FOR YOUR 40th! ARE YOU SURPRISED? WOW! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HONEY. OH! OH!OH! MAKE A WISH, HONEY. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE GOT A 40-YEAR-OLD SON. AND IN JUST A FEW YEARS, THESE YOUNG FELLOWS HERE WILL BE OUT ON THEIR OWN, AND THEN I'LL KNOW I'M GOOD AND OLD. I THINK HE LOOKS PRETTY DARN GOOD FOR A GERIATRIC PATIENT. I'M, UH -- I'M GOING TO BE RIGHT BACK. WHERE ARE YOU GOING, HONEY? I LEFT THE DONNER FILE AT THE OFFICE. IT'S DUE TOMORROW. I WAS GOING TO WORK ON IT AT HOME. WELL, CAN'T IT WAIT? IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY. HONEY, I MADE A COMMITMENT. FOR GOD'S SAKES, JOE, TAKE ONE NIGHT OFF. I'll be back before you know I'm gone. EVERYONE, PLEASE START WITHOUT ME. WELL, THIS IS JUST GREAT. NOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT HIM BEHIND HIS BACK. I'M GOING TO GO FINISH MY HOMEWORK. YEAH. ME, TOO. IT'S A SHAME HE HAS TO BE AT THE OFFICE SO MUCH. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WE KEEP A LOT OF OLD PHOTOS OF HIM AROUND. THAT WAY WE RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE DOES COME HOME. LYNNE, PLEASE. PICK UP. COME ON, I KNOW YOU'RE THERE. YOU'RE SCREENING YOUR CALLS, RIGHT? LYNNE. FOR GOD'S SAKES, LYNNE! IT'S MY BIRTHDAY! AND I-I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE WITH DOT WITHOUT MY BOYS. AND MY BOYS ARE GROWING UP SO FAST. I'M 40 YEARS OLD, AND I-I-I'M A MESS. PICK UP! PLEASE! IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, LYNNE. UGH. LYNNE! I AM BEGGING YOU! I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE. JUST -- I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU. THAT'S ALL. I WANT TO -- I WANT TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU. LYNNE, I'M BEGGING YOU! I BOUGHT A WEDDING RING. I WANT TO MARRY YOU. YES. OH, YES, JOE! I LOVE YOU. ANY REASON YOU'RE NOT WEARING THAT RING FOR THE JURY TODAY? THE REASON I'M NOT WEARING IT IS MY FINGERS ARE SWOLLEN, AND, QUITE FRANKLY, I COULDN'T EVEN GET IT ON. OH. SO YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH YOUR EYES ANDYOUR FINGERS. YES, IT'S VERY WARM IN HERE. MY FINGER -- MY HANDS ARE SWOLLEN. HI, HONEY, YOU'RE HOME. CAN I MAKE YOU A TUNA-FISH SANDWICH? NO, THANKS. UM, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING. WHAT IS IT? UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT I, UH -- I CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. AND I'M LEAVING YOU, DOT. I WANT A DIVORCE. A DIVORCE? I PUT YOU SECOND -- SOMETIMES THIRD -- AND I CAN'T... I-I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU IF YOU HATED ME. HOW COULD I HATE YOU? I LOVE YOU. LATELY I'VE BEEN FEELING SICK, AND I'VE HAD A LOT OF HEADACHES AND A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. WHAT'S WRONG? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WRONG. YOU CAN'T JUST WALK IN HERE AND TELL ME YOU'RE LEAVING. I CAN'T STAY. I-I CAN'T STAY. JOE, WHAT ABOUT ME AND THE KIDS? NOTHING WILL CHANGE FOR YOU AND THE CHILDREN. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. LISTEN, I-I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH AN ATTORNEY. I SHOULD GO. GO? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING. YOU CAN'T JUST WALK IN HERE AND TELL ME YOU'RE LEAVING. WE HAVE A FAMILY! WE'RE GOING ON A FAMILY SKI TRIP IN FOUR DAYS. THE BOYS WILL NOTICE THAT YOU'RE NOT THERE. WE WILL GO TO THE HOTEL. WE'LL GET SEPARATE ROOMS -- WHATEVER. BUT WE'LL WORK THIS OUT. JOE, YOU'RE JUST WORKING TOO HARD. NO. NO. JOE, YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO COME BACK AND TELL THE CHILDREN WHY YOU'RE LEAVING. I WILL, I WILL. I'M... I SHOULD GO. JOE? JOE? JOE? DID JOE RETURN THE NEXT DAY TO TALK TO THE CHILDREN? NO. NO, HE DIDN'T. AND I HAD DECIDED I WASN'T GONNA TELL ANYONEABOUT JOE UNTIL WE TOLD THE BOYS. I COULDN'T TELL THE BOYS WITHOUT JOE BEING THERE, BECAUSE HE NEEDED TO BE THERE TO ASSURE THEM THAT HE LOVED THEM AND IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT. I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL THE BOYS ABOUT JOE WHILE THE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS WERE UP, BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID THEY'D ALWAYS ASSOCIATE CHRISTMAS WITH SOMETHING SAD. I GOT TO... TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING, OKAY? AND...THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO GOOD WAY -- THERE'S NO GENTLE -- THERE'S NO NICE WAY TO TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU. SO I'M GONNA SAY IT OUT, OKAY? UM... YOUR DADDY HAS LEFT US. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. BUT I WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE IF I CAN, OKAY? WE'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT, NOW. WE'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. B-BUT IS HE EVER COMING BACK TO LIVE WITH US? NO. I DON'T THINK SO. BUT HE'S STILL GONNA SEE YOU BOYS ALL THE TIME. SO, ARE YOU GUYS GETTING A DIVORCE OR SOMETHING? YEAH, I GUESS IF THINGS DON'T GET BETTER WE ARE. BUT... WHY? I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE -- WERE HAPPY. I THOUGHT -- I THOUGHT WE ALL WERE JUST HAPPY. WHAT HAPPENED? I DON'T KNOW, ERIC. I JUST DON'T KNOW. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. I GOT -- I GOT A NUMBER HERE. IT'S YOUR DADDY'S NUMBER. YOU BE MY BIG GUY, NOW, AND GO CALL YOUR DADDY, AND I'M SURE HE'LL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. OKAY? GO CALL YOUR DADDY. GO ON, OKAY? Keith: It's true? Aren't you gonna come back? THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING BETWEEN THE THREE OF US. THIS IS BETWEEN YOUR MOTHER AND ME. I, UH -- I JUST DON'T LOVE your mother anymore the way a husband loves a wife. SO, I'M GONNA COME AND SEE YOU GUYS SOON. OKAY? Everything's gonna be all right. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. UH... WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET PACKED FOR THAT SKI TRIP? WE STILL GOING? YEAH, WE'RE STILL GOING. COME ON, BABY. IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. DO YOU REMEMBER IN "TOM SAWYER" WHEN EVERYBODY THOUGHT TOM DROWNED, BUT HE DIDN'T, AND HE -- AND HE COMES BACK? I... I JUST KEEP HOPING THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE WITH DAD. ME, TOO, HONEY. ME, TOO. WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM THAT SKI TRIP, HONESTLY, I JUST -- I COULDN'T KEEP IT IN ANYMORE. I DECIDED I WAS JUST GONNA TELL THE VERY FIRST PERSON I SAW. MY NEIGHBOR NANCY WAS THE LUCKY VICTIM. THE WHOLE THING IS SO WEIRD. HE KEPT SAYING HE WAS SICK, WHICH IS REALLY OUT OF CHARACTER. I MEAN, I AM STANDING THERE IN MY OWN KITCHEN, MAKING A TUNA-FISH SANDWICH, AND MY HUSBAND WALKS IN AND TELLS ME HE'S LEAVING. EVEN THE THOUGHT OF TUNA FISH MAKES ME SICK NOW. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT, AND THE WHOLE THING KEEPS PLAYING OVER IN YOUR MIND REAL SLOW? AND YOU KEEP TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS YOU MIGHT HAVE AVOIDED IT. THAT IS WHAT MY WHOLE MARRIAGE FEELS LIKE. I KEEP GOING OVER IT IN MY HEAD, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE, AND HONEST TO GOD, NANCY, I DO NOT KNOW HOW MY WHOLE LIFE GOT TOTALED. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THERE'S ANOTHER WOMAN INVOLVED. NOT JOE. NO. IF I WERE YOU, I'D HIRE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR? MM-HMM. WELL, FOR HEAVEN'S -- DOROTHY HUTELMYER? IT'S KATIE. I WORK AT WINWOOD WITH YOUR HUSBAND, JOE. YES, HOW ARE YOU? I'm fine. BUT WE ALL HEARD HERE THAT THE NEWS IS OUT NOW ABOUT JOE AND LYNNE, AND WE JUST WANT TO SAY WE'RE SORRY WE NEVER TOLD YOU, BUT WE WERE ALL KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT OUR JOBS. And then it went on for so long -- I mean, three years is foreverfor an affair -- HE WAS SEEING HER FOR -- THREE YEARS. AT THE VERY LEAST, THE WHOLE SITUATION HAS BEEN A DISTRACTION FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES. AT THE WORST, YOU'VE SADDLED US WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR A HUGE SEXUAL-HARASSMENT CASE. I THINK THE BEST THING FOR EVERYONE WOULD BE FOR YOU TO LEAVE. JOE, YOU'RE A SMART GUY. HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING SO STUPID? THERE'S NO WAY THIS OFFICE CAN FUNCTION WITH THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF YOU AND MR. HUTELMYER. HOWEVER, WE ARE PREPARED TO OFFER YOU A RICH SEVERANCE PACKAGE IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR AGREEING TO HOLD THIS COMPANY AND MR. JOSEPH P. HUTELMYER HARMLESS OF ANY SEXUAL-HARASSMENT CHARGES NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU LADIES FOR MEETING ME TODAY. IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING. I HAVE SOME -- SOME QUESTIONS. MY CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL WITH HER CHILDREN, FOR GOD'S SAKES, AND I SORT OF NEED TO KNOW BEFORE MY CHILDREN. LYNNE TOTALLY CHANGED THE WAY SHE LOOKED, STARTED FLIRTING AROUND. YOU MEAN WHEN SHE FIRST CAME TO THE COMPANY? I MEAN THE MINUTE YOUR HUSBAND BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY. SHE STARTED HANGING OUT IN HIS OFFICE ALL DAY LONG -- THE WHOLE TIME. DID SHE GO ON THE BUSINESS TRIPS? MM-HMM. ALL OF THEM. SHE WENT ON ALL THE TRIPS WITH HIM. WHEN SHE WASN'T HAVING HIM OVER TO HER HOUSE ALL HOURS OF THE DAY ANDNIGHT. YOU OKAY, HONEY? YOU WANT A FRY? KEEP YOUR STRENGTH UP? SURE. WELL, THAT'S, UH -- THAT'S THAT, THEN. I THINK WE GOT A PRETTY FAIR SETTLEMENT. I HAD A GOOD MARRIAGE, A SOLID MARRIAGE, UNTIL THAT WOMAN WALKED IN AND DESTROYED IT! WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO BE HAPPY BECAUSE JOE GAVE ME ALIMONY? WELL, BELIEVE ME, I AM NOTHAPPY. THERE IS NOTHING FAIR ABOUT ANY OF THIS! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME? WHAT COULD SHE HAVE DONE TO MAKE YOU DO THIS? LOOK, DOT, IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENED. "IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENED" FOR THREE YEARS? LYNNE, GO WAIT IN THE CAR. I DON'T WANT YOU SUBJECTED TO THIS. YOU DON'T WANT HER SUBJECTED TO THIS? YOU'RE MARRIED TO ME FOR 18 YEARS, AND YOU DON'T WANT HER SUBJECTED TO THIS? AND YOU! YOU'RE A DAMN THIEF! YOU COME INTO MY HOME AND YOU STEAL MY HUSBAND. I WELCOMEDYOU INTO MY HOME, AND YOU DESTROYED IT! COME BACK HERE. I'M TALKING TO YOU! DOT, YOU'RE MAKING A FOOL OF YOURSELF! NO, I THINK YOU DID THAT FORME! Look -- isn't that Dot Hutelmyer? ATTENTION, SHOPPERS. WE'RE HAVING A SPECIAL TODAY ON SOFT DRINKS. BUY ANY SIX-PACK AND GET ANOTHER FOR HALF PRICE. THANK YOU. HI. HI. ATTENTION, SHOPPERS, THIS IS DOT HUTELMYER, AND, YES, I AM DIVORCED NOW. YES, MY HUSBAND LEFT ME FOR LYNNE COX, AND THEY HAD AN AFFAIR FOR YEARS. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK ME OR SAY TO ME, COULD YOU PLEASE COME TO CHECKOUT AISLE 3 AND SAY IT TO MY FACE? THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO SAY -- WHAT? I THINK WHAT LYNNE COX DID WAS TERRIBLE. Thank you. Thank you very much. IT JUST FELT SO GOOD TO HEAR HER SAY WHAT LYNNE COX DID WAS WRONG. I WILL SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS IF YOU WANT. AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO STOP CALLING ME "POOR DOT." THEY OUGHT TO PUT IT ON MY LICENSE OR SOMETHING -- POOR DOT HUTELMYER, 5'5". AND I KNOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL SOME CLOSURE AFTER A DIVORCE, BUT I -- I DON'T. SUE HER. SUE HER? SUE HER FOR WHAT, GRAND THEFT HUSBAND? I DON'T KNOW. PEOPLE SUE EACH OTHER FOR EVERYTHING. THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING YOU COULD SUE HER FOR. WELL, EVEN IF I COULDSUE HER FOR SOMETHING, THAT WOULD MEAN EXPOSING THE BOYS TO COURT, AND I COULDN'T DO THAT. I AM RAISING SONS, TOO. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR BEING A JERK. THAT'S THE WORST PART. JOE WASN'T A JERK. HE WAS A GOOD MAN. I HAD A GOOD MARRIAGE. I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHY. BUT I HAD A GOOD MARRIAGE TO A GOOD MAN UNTIL LYNNE COX TOOK THAT ALL APART. I'M SORRY. HONEY... IT'S OKAY TO FALL APART WHEN YOUR MARRIAGE DOES. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO FALL APART. I WANT TO DOSOMETHING. I WANT TO SUE LYNNE COX FOR ALIENATION OF AFFECTION AS PRESCRIBED BY THE A.L.R., SECTION 12, VOLUME 2, PAGE 807. MRS. HUTELMYER, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THESE TYPES OF CASES CAN BE DIFFICULT TO WIN. WE NOT ONLY HAVE TO PROVE YOU HAD A HAPPY MARRIAGE -- A DIFFICULT THING TO DEMONSTRATE -- BUT ALSO THAT MS. COX INTENTIONALLY SET OUT TO TAMPER WITH THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT, MR. WALKER. AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK JOE WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT IF THERE HADN'T BEEN SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE MARRIAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT ONLY ME, JOE, AND MY BOYS LIVED IN THAT HOUSE, AND ONLY I KNOW IN MY HEART WHAT IS TRUE -- THAT WE HAD A GOOD AND SOLID MARRIAGE UNTIL THAT WOMAN CAME ALONG. IT WILL MEAN THE AIRING OF A LOT OF DIRTY LAUNDRY IN PUBLIC. YOUR SEX LIFE WITH YOUR HUSBAND WILL BE DISCUSSED -- ALMOST ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOUR MARRIAGE IS FAIR GAME. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY SUBJECTED TO THAT? I HAVE DEVOTED MY LIFE TO MY FAMILY, MR. WALKER. I DO NOT INTEND TO TURN BACK NOW. ALL RIGHT. LOOK AT THIS. SHE IS SUING ME! THAT BITCH OF AN EX-WIFE OF YOURS IS SUING ME! DOT, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. IT ISN'T FAIR TO DRAG LYNNE OVER THE COALS. I'M THE ONE WHO DID WRONG, AND I KNOW IT. I CAN'T HELP THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE. I HAD NO CONTROL OVER THAT PART, BUT I HANDLED THE WHOLE THING REALLY HORRIBLY, AND I'M SORRY, BUT I JUST DON'T SEE WHAT YOU HOPE TO GAIN FROM THIS. LYNNE WAS FIRED, TOO. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET MUCH MONEY OUT OF HER. THIS ISN'T ABOUT MONEY. I DON'T CARE IF I GET A PENNY, JOE. I JUST WANT SOMEONE TO AGREE WITH ME THAT WHAT LYNNE DID WAS WRONG. HOW CAN YOU DRAG OUR... dirty laundry OUT INTO OPEN COURT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE TOWN? I THINK YOUARE THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT SHOULD BE ASKING ME "HOW COULD I"ABOUT ANYTHING. ISN'T THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN WORK THIS THING OUT BETWEEN US? OH, I WISH YOU'D ASKED ME THAT THREE YEARS AGO. DOT... I'M SORRY. NOW, LYNNE, IN THE DIVORCE DECREE BETWEEN THE HUTELMYERS, YOU WERE ACCUSED OF INTERFERING WITH THE LOVING MARITAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED BETWEEN THE PLAINTIFF AND JOSEPH PETER HUTELMYER. BY YOUR ACTIONS AND CONDUCT AND ENTICEMENTS, YOU INDUCED JOSEPH PETER HUTELMYER TO LEAVE HIS MARITAL HOME. YOU ALIENATED AND DESTROYED A LOVE AND AFFECTION THAT PREVIOUSLY EXISTED BETWEEN THE PLAINTIFF AND JOSEPH HUTELMYER, AND SEDUCED JOSEPH PETER HUTELMYER. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THESE ALLEGATIONS? I DENY THEM. YOU DENY THEM? YOU DENY EVERYONE OF THEM? SHE STATED THAT SHE DENIED THEM. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I INDUCED HIM TO LEAVE THE MARITAL HOME. I THINK HE WAS ALREADY GONE, AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I SEDUCED HIM. I DO NOT TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED. AND UNTIL DOT CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE SHARES IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THIS MARRIAGE, SHE CAN NEVER GET ON WITH HER LIFE. WELL, THANK YOU, DR. LYNNE. EVEN IF JOE SEDUCED HER AND NOT VICE VERSA, SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO BLAME IT ON DOT. THAT JUST BURNS ME. I JUST KEEP THINKING OF THE SAYING, "ALL BAD MARRIAGES ARE THE SAME." BUT THAT'S THE POINT, SUSAN. IT WAS A GOODMARRIAGE, AND THEN LYNNE CAME IN AND BROKE IT UP. THAT'S WHAT THE JURY'S BEEN DECIDING ALL AFTERNOON, ISN'T IT? DID LYNNE COX ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF? THE FIRST THING THAT DOT HUTELMYER HAS TO PROVE IS THAT THERE REALLY WAS A GENUINE, MARITAL RELATIONSHIP. I'VE SEEN A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A GREATRELATIONSHIP IN THE BEGINNING. AND I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT MAYBE THERE WASN'T, IN THE END, A GENUINE, MARITAL RELATIONSHIP. TOWARDS THE END, JOE HUTELMYER WAS ABLE TO CARRY ON TWO LIVES. DOT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CLUE. DOES THAT NOT TELL YOU THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THIS MARRIAGE -- WHEN A MAN CAN LIVE TWO LIVES, AND THE WIFE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A CLUE THAT ANYTHING IS GOING ON? AND SHE SAYS, "I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S ALL THE OTHER WOMAN'S FAULT." DOT IS THE CONTROLLING FAULT. SHE IS THE EFFECTIVE CAUSE OF THIS. WHEN DO YOU LEARN TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE? THIS TRIAL IS ABOUT A FEW THINGS. MAINLY, IT'S ABOUT MONEY. DOROTHY HUTELMYER WANTS MORE MONEY. BUT DON'T MAKE LYNNE COX PAY FOR JOE AND DOT'S FAILED MARRIAGE -- NOT AFTER WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM. IT IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR FAIR. AS JOE HUTELMYER ADMITTED SAYING TO HIMSELF THE NIGHT HE DECIDED TO LEAVE, "MY KIDS ARE GROWING OLD, "I'M LIVING WITH A WOMAN I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH "EXCEPT MY CHILDREN. I DO NOT WANT TO GROW OLD IN THIS SITUATION." HE MADE THAT DECISION! HEDID. AND HE IS PAYING THE PRICE -- HE'S A BIG BOY -- $4,000 A MONTH. IT IS NOT LYNNE COX'S PRICE TO PAY. AND THE WIFE SAYS, "I HAD NO IDEA MY HUSBAND WAS UNHAPPY. "I DON'T ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY. "I BLAME THE OTHER WOMAN, AND I WANT MORE MONEY TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER." THAT'S WHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT. MONEY. AND I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THERE HAS BEEN A FAILURE... OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. SUDDENLY, MS. COX IS THE VICTIM. LYNNE COX IS NOT A VICTIM. SHE IS A CAUSE. AND MR. ALDERMAN IS SAYING PUNISH DOT BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED IN HER HUSBAND -- BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED THE MAN THAT WROTE HER ALL THESE POEMS, BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED THE MAN THAT HAD BEEN A GOOD MAN. HOW ABOUT THAT ROCK? HOW MANY OF YOU LADIES HAVE A $3,000 DIAMOND? DIDN'T EVEN WEAR IT. SHE AIN'T GONNA GET UP HERE AND WAVE THAT $3,000 ROCK IN YOUR FACES. "LET'S DECEIVETHE JURY. "THEY'RE STUPID, RIGHT? THEY FELL OFF THE TURNIP TRUCK YESTERDAY." THAT'S WHAT SHE THINKS OF YOUR INTELLIGENCE. I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED, BUT I APPRECIATE YOU BEARING WITH ME. THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT -- LYNNE COX WAS DESCRIBED AS MATRONLY, SHY. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE'S THIS OTHER WOMAN -- SEXY, SULTRY LOOKS AT JOE. HOW MANY OF YOU LADIES EVER GO IN YOUR BOSS'S OFFICE AND TAKE A CHAIR -- WITH A DRESS ON -- AND PUT YOUR LEGS OVER THE ARM OF THE CHAIR AND LET YOUR DRESS HIKE UP TO YOUR THIGHS? ANY OF Y'ALL EVER DO THAT? MNH-MNH. SO WHAT CHANGED? I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED. JOE HUTELMYER GOT PROMOTED. HE'S THE MAN. SUDDENLY, MS. COX IS IN HIS OFFICE ALL THE TIME. SHE'S STRAIGHTENING HIS TIE, GRABBING ICE OUT OF HIS DRINK, AROUSING HIM. NOW... WAS THERE A GENUINE MARITAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN JOE AND DOT? A GENUINE MARITAL RELATIONSHIP IS ONE WHERE THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF LOVE. DOES THAT MEAN IF THERE WAS NO SEX, THERE WAS NO DEGREE OF LOVE OR AFFECTION? NO. IT MEANS THERE WAS NO SEX, AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHY THERE WAS NO SEX. SEX WAS TAKING PLACE OVER AT LYNNE'S HOUSE. THIS IS ABOUT A MARRIAGE. IT'S ABOUT LOVE AND COMFORT. THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS -- YOU GET SICK, NOBODY'S THERE WITH YOU. YOUR PARENTS DIE, NOBODY'S THERE TO GO TO THE FUNERAL WITH YOU. PEOPLE LEAVE YOU OUT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A PART OF THE GROUP ANYMORE. HOW DO YOU PUT A PRICE ON THAT? THAT BRINGS US TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES. PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE TO SAY, "LADY, WHAT YOU DID IS SO BAD, "WE WANT TO SAY TO EVERYBODY IN ALAMANCE COUNTY, "'YOU DON'T GO OUT AND DO THAT. "'YOU DON'T GO DO WHAT LYNNE COX DID. "'YOU DON'T SET YOUR MIND "'WHEN YOUR BOSS BECOMES PRESIDENT "THAT YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY THIS MARRIAGE AND FAMILY. WE WANT TO GET THIS MESSAGE OUT.'" MARRIAGE IS IN TROUBLE. PEOPLE ARE DIVORCED, FAMILIES ARE BROKEN. THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO PREACH TO THE COMMUNITY, TO TELL THEM ADULTERY IS WRONG. YOU PREACH THAT WORD. THANK YOU. MMM! LOW BLOW ON THE MESSAGE THING. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WALKER'S CLOSE THIS MORNING WAS FABULOUS. JURIES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEND MESSAGES. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO JUDGE GUILT OR INNOCENCE. YOU CAN STILL GET THE MESSAGE THAT ADULTERY'S WRONG AND NOT LAY ALLTHE BLAME ON LYNNE. WELL, THEY OUGHT TO SEND A DIFFERENT MESSAGE -- KEEP YOUR PRIVATE LIFE OUT OF THE COURTROOM. Y'ALL, HUSH UP. THERE'S A BULLETIN. AFTER A 5-HOUR DELIBERATION, THE JURY HAS REACHED A VERDICT IN THE HUTELMYER ALIENATION OF AFFECTION TRIAL. THEY ARE JUST REENTERING THE COURTROOM, AND WE'LL BE BRINGING YOU THAT VERDICT AS SOON AS IT'S ANNOUNCED. ANYBODY CARE TO MAKE A WAGER? YOU'RE ON. WE NOW RETURN TO OUR SCHEDULED PROGRAM. HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT? WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR. Judge: DID THE DEFENDANT, LYNNE COX, ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF'S HUSBAND? YES. Judge: ORDER! WHAT AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF COMPENSATORY AND/OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IS THE PLAINTIFF ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM THE DEFENDANT? WE FIND FOR THE PLAINTIFF IN THE SUM OF $1 MILLION. ORDER! NO WAY! NO! ORDER! ORDER IN THE COURT! OH, MAN! YOU KNOW THAT'S WRONG. YOU KNOWTHAT'S WRONG! THEY'RE GONNA APPEAL. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. I REALLY JUST FEEL LIKE THE PEOPLE OF NORTH CAROLINA SAID I WAS RIGHT TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF AND TOLD LYNNE COX THAT SHE WAS WRONG TO BREAK UP MY HOME, AND THAT'S ALL I REALLY EVER WANTED. DO YOU THINK YOU'RE A SYMBOL FOR FAMILY VALUES? NO. NO, I... THINK I'M AN... ORDINARY PERSON. AND I REALLY JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO MY BOYS AND ON WITH MY LIFE. WHAT DO YOU PLAN --HOW DO -- EXCUSE US, PLEASE. Woman: HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR BOYS WILL REACT TO THE VERDICT? Eric: THEY ALWAYS SEEMED REALLY HAPPY TO ME... BOYS? I'M HOME. THEY DID LOTS OF STUFF TOGETHER, AND, UH -- AND MY MOM AND DAD THEY JUST DIDN'T FIGHT. HONEY, WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? JANE PAULEY'S ON THE PHONE. GIVE ME THE PHONE. GO. HELLO? WHOEVER THIS IS, I DON'T THINK THIS IS VERY FUNNY. OH, MS. PAULEY? NO, I DON'T MIND TALKING TO YOU, BUT I WOULD PREFER YOU NOT TALK TO MY CHILDREN. YES, THAT WOULD BE FINE. TOMORROW -- YES. YES, THANK YOU. HUH. Woman: HELLO, I'M CALLING FOR DOT HUTELMYER. WE'D LIKE TO BOOK YOU ON "20/20" TO DISCUSS YOUR LAWSUIT. Man: HELLO. I'M A PRODUCER FOR "DATELINE." WE'D LIKE TO INTERVIEW YOU FOR OUR NEWSMAGAZINE. Woman: HI, YOU DON'T KNOW ME, BUT I JUST HEARD ABOUT YOU WINNING YOUR SUIT. MY HUSBAND LEFT ME FOR OUR BABYSITTER AFTER 15 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, AND MAYBE IF MORE PEOPLE WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, THEY'D HAVE A LITTLE MORE RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S MARRIAGES. SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID. YOU'RE WELCOME. HUH. YOU THINK DOT REALLY DID IT FOR THE MONEY? OR REVENGE.SHE'S SURE FAMOUS NOW. WELL, SOMEBODY FELL IN LOVE, SOMEBODY FELL OUT OF LOVE. NOBODY HANDLED IT VERY WELL. IT'S SAD. TRAGIC EVEN, MAYBE. BUT IT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT THOSE THREE. THE VERDICT WAS RIGHT. THIS TYPE OF CASE IS GOING TO TIE UP THE COURTS LIKE CRAZY. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING -- DOT FOUND A MILLION WAYS TO GET EVEN WITH LYNNE. WELL, TIME FOR ME TO ROLL. YEAH, ME, TOO. NIGHT. I'M GONNA GO HOME AND GIVE MY WIFE A BIG SLOPPY KISS IN CASE SHE'S INSPIRED BY ALL THIS TO GET HERSELF AN ATTORNEY AND SUE ME FOR NEGLECT. SEE YOU TOMORROW, FAYE. OKAY. HERE'S YOUR $20 BACK. OH, BUT -- NOPE, NOPE, NOPE! THANKS, FAYE. THANK YOU. Dot: AND I REALLY JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO MY BOYS AND ON WITH MY LIFE. WHAT DO YOU PLAN -- HOW DO -- Woman: HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR BOYS WILL REACT? COME ON, BOYS! KEITH, HAVE YOU GOT YOUR HOMEWORK? HAVE YOU GOT YOUR SOCCER SHOES? BYE-BYE. I LOVE YOU. NOW, YOU BE REALLY SWEET. CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELVES. IF YOU NEED ME, CALL ME. OH! Keith: HEY, DAD. Lynne: OKAY, GUYS! OKAY, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO TODAY?
