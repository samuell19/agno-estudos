I wasn't there. Jenny was with her. You guys, you made really good time. Drove straight through from Toronto. Traded off. 401 was crazy. It was all crazy. Let me give you a hand. Have you heard from Donald? Maybe the wrong email. See? Whoa. Yeah. Have you been eating? So, you're in touch with Donald? Your mom was, seems like. She had an email for him? In her desk. So, this-- Tam, let's put our stuff in our room and have a quick wash. Yeah, okay. Dad? Go ahead. This'll keep. Here you go. Here I go. Where do you go? This is. I can't. Hey, it's okay, Tam. I told you that she knew where Don was. Why wouldn't she tell me? What did I do to-- You didn't do anything. I don't think this is about you. He should be here. Should isn't helpful, Tam. Come on. Go have a wash, downstairs in 15, kay? Should I get that? Hi, help you? Jesus. Miranda. No, Dad, it's me, Dawn. Oh my God. Hang on, like Don, her brother? No, like Dawn, her sister. Um, shall I, uh, tea anyone? Betsy? She must have forgotten me. Dad? I'm glad to see you, Dad. You look exactly like her. I know. Go on. I ... When did? It's been happening since I left. Five years ago. Where'd you go? Montreal. On your own? I didn't have a buddy. You speak French? I do now. And Mom knew. Yes. This is awful. Tam! It's okay. No, it's not. You know, this should be about her, and as usual, it's just about you. Got another down here for you, Andy. Jerry. Hey, Stranger. They behaving? Little lambs. Whatcha doin' here? We're good here. Whose car? Tammy's. She brought her boyfriend. Ha ha, must be serious. Yeah, fiancé. Dawn's back. Great. Isn't it? Dawn, I mean. That's what you said. Don's back. Dawn, like sunrise. You'll see. Oh. I'm not an asshole. I didn't say that you ... It's an adjustment. I'm-- What? Comfortable, more. You never called. Birthdays. I did. I hung up. I thought I'd lose you forever if you knew. You didn't have me. You didn't even give me a chance to ... Are those Mom's? Yeah. I thought she lost them. She said that they'd be her daughter's one day. They are. Wow. Hope it's okay. I put something in the oven. Great, I'll go have a wash. I knew, something, from forever. I spent the drive planning to tell Dad that you're gay, if you came. But this? This? Dawn, I don't know how to do this. I thought she was gonna be okay. She seemed better at Christmas. You saw her at Christmas? You just said-- I came back to Halifax when she got sick. You've been in Halifax for two years? What, like in school? I wanna do sports physio, but I need some courses. So I came back after her first mastectomy, so when she started chemo, if Jenny brought her in, I could help out or ... Jenny? Jenny knew? And we didn't? She didn't want Dad being the only one not knowing, and I thought him hating me would make her sicker. Jenny knew everything? She did what Mom wanted. Mom did what I wanted. It was never anything to do with you. No kidding. Whoa, I don't think Byron will be very comfortable on this bed. Don't be disgusting. He's sleeping in the spare room. Don't you guys live together? Dad is right over there. And I don't want anyone ever touching me again. Don't. Don't do that. I ... I hate ... I hate you. Mom's dead. I want her. Come on. Sorry. We have to, big baby. I know. Dawn is still an amazing player. He, she's on a team in the city, women's team. She wants to be a sports physio. Did you know that? How would I? I don't get it. It's hard. But, she's here. I'm glad.

See you later. Betsy. Good girl. Hello, woo. Well, you can certainly tell that you're related. You're the spit of Miranda. People say. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm Sandra. My husband, Jerry, and his brother, Andy, they run the farm the way over. Right now, they're helping John Andrew. Awfully hard to run a farm, you know, when ... Anyway, I woulda brought pizza. I work over at the Pizza Palace, but I thought maybe he'd prefer some home cooking. Is he eating? Uh. You know, I didn't think that Miranda had nieces. She doesn't, didn't. I'm Dawn. Dawn? Yeah, Dawn, Miranda's-- Jesus. Nope, just her daughter. Oh. Thanks. Tammy sent it along yesterday. Lovely obit. She writes stuff for advertising. Tammy, sorry for your loss. Oh, thank you, Arthur. How's Babs? Oh, we're all good. I told your dad, this is a beautiful obit. You want a job? No, thank you. Is that it? Do you mind? Thanks. I hear your young man's with you. Yeah, he's in the cafe. He's got a latte addiction. Thanks. Thanks, Arthur. See you outside, Dad. Oh, John Andrew. Miranda paid, six weeks back. I'll see you to the door. Are folks eating? A bit. Not for a lack of casseroles. Well, people wanna help. Yeah, like, don't say she means well. How's the team, glorious? Solid. Losing. I can't do this, Jenny. The wake, the funeral. Yes, you can. It'll be-- Awful, best-case scenario. Everybody home? Yep, Dawn came yesterday. That's good. Arthur, do we have to do a wake? You do what you want, but the town loves a wake. The town loved Miranda. Right then. See you tomorrow. Kay? Not a surprise, eh, Bets? You think she'd go, girl? You think? That might be the best casserole I've ever had. Well it wasn't bad for artichokes. What's wrong with artichokes? Nothing, you just don't expect country folk to eat fancy casseroles with artichokes. Country folk? Yeah, mm-hm. Unsophisticated, redneck, meat-eating folk like you. We did meatless Mondays every week. Pretty tasty, considering the source. Sandra dropped it off this morning. Well, set it on the steps and ran. Wait, Jerry's Sandra? She meant well. Poison, that woman. Hello? Oh, Jerry, go on through. Jerry, everything okay? The milk going? Just picked it up. The test was fine. Good, we did not need another load dumped. Yeah. Listen, I hope you don't mind, I'm not nuts, but God's truth this, five o'clock, funerals come on the radio, Miranda's name for the wake tomorrow. Every cow in the barn stopped chewing. Milkers going, chugging away. Not another sound. They stopped breathing to listen. Never seen it. Oh, thanks. Sandra said she brought something, the artichokes? Yeah, delicious, thank you. A bit fancy for me. Glad you ate it. Night, John Andrew. Jerry. Tammy. My fiancé, Byron. Good to meet you, Byron. And, uh. Dawn. Dawn. Just a kid last time I saw you. All grown up, eh? Yes. Different person now. Good your home for your mom. Bless you. Night. I can't believe she didn't tell him. About Dawn? About everything. About how sick she was. Byron? Uh-huh. We have to share everything. We do. Except a bed around here. Okay, well. It's fine. Your bed's toast anyways. I wouldn't dare right next to your parents' bedroom. Oh my God! I mean your dad's. Sorry. Tam? Hey. I'm scared. Of life without her. You're scared, how do you think Dawn feels? Your mom was the only family she had for years. She chose. Why is this so easy for you? No history. She's a new person. Gorgeous blonde person. Jesus, Byron! Tam, I'm joking. Come on. None of this is funny. When did you know, Miranda? Managed it all, didn't you? Paid for your ... Fucking cows stopping chewing. Dad? Yeah? I'm going out. Is Jerry back in the morning, or are you milking? I am. Want help? I'm good. I can get up early and-- Go on, get your beauty sleep. Have you got rubber boots? Think my old ones are there. What's going on? Why is everyone up? It's a farm, Tammy. We're doing farm things. Go back to bed, girl. Get your beauty sleep. What's going on? They're doing farm things. Just go back to bed. I'm up now. Could I do farm things? I don't know, can you? I'm a quick study. All right then. I'm never eating steak again. You'll get over that. That was funny, Martine, firing you, huh? That was Martine? Yeah. Who is Martine? Cow that was trying to knock Dawn over. Martine was his ... Sorry. 4H project when she was 15. I loved that calf. Wait, 4H is a real thing? I thought it was like a movie thing. Oh, Jesus. Where did Tammy find you? Dad? Yeah. Do you know if you can get more parts for the Jubilee? The what? The Jubilee, the old tractor. You guys talked about fixing it. I loved it. Loved a tractor? Learned to drive on it. It was my grandpa's. I thought maybe I could try fixing it. You know nothing about that tractor. What was that? I guess girls don't fix tractors. Right. Guess I'm doing the dishes then. I'll do it. Don't pout. I am not. Fuck this. Cows are easier. That bike's ancient. Probably won't blow up. I didn't do anything. Why aren't you talking to me? I'm not not talking. I'm just not answering. He's counting the minutes till I leave. Give him a chance. It's Day Three. Gonna fix it? Mom wanted it fixed. Remember that grandfather clock? Yeah, he nearly killed me. Yeah, till you fixed it, then it was my boy, the mechanical genius. Ugh. What? Do we just forget that you were someone else, the golden heir to all this? Is there a rule book that I should have? I wasn't someone else. Google it. You might not give a shit, but I have friends who think I'm pretty fucking golden now and a life I don't run by a rule book. What stupid questions. I forgot what a jerk you can be. Was "are you gonna fix it" a stupid question? No. Dad? He's at the funeral home. Dawn? I'm going as fast as I can, okay? It's fine, I j ... I Googled it. I know who you are. I always have. I just ... I'm not good at this. Whoa. Too much? Perfect. You okay? We'll see. What? What? Arthur Murray's, come on. What? What, what are you doing? Looking for footsteps. Byron, just. Arthur Murray's, come on. World-famous dance school. My parents went every Saturday for years. You put your feet in the footsteps. Here, Laney, let me give you a hand. No, no no, squares. Get my stick. I didn't know you had a suit. John Andrew? We planned to tell you. She tried so hard to wait for you. I'm glad you were there. Dawn? Your father said this morning that you were right back in the barn. Oh, as good as any fella ever was. Dying to dance? Hey, don't encourage him. And just don't draw more attention to yourself. Get a grip, Tam. Do you mind or? Of course. No, of course as in all good, totally fine, awesome. So it's fine then? Yeah. Okay. I'm Banu. I was your mom's massage therapist. Oh right. She mentioned you, how much she liked you. How much you helped. Oh, you found her, Banu? Mm-hm, yeah. Well, that coulda been worse. Still time. Funeral on Friday. Banu says there's music at the pub tonight. Probably not a good idea. I'm gonna see Laney home. She's-- Drunk? A bit emotional. She had like a gallon of punch. I'll get you up for milking, though, huh, Byron? Yep, that's me, the king of the teats. It's like I'm in a sick reality show created to prove why I should not marry you. Come on. Let's go get emotional. I was travelling for a year after school, but then I stopped here for a night and I met Ethan. Is he your boyfriend? No, Ethan manages the cafe I work at. And he offered me a job, and I thought, why not, right? I like it here. Your mom was one of my very first clients. I'm really gonna miss her a lot. So you have your own practice? Well, I have six regular clients. Three are your mom's friends. Jenny, Debbie, Joy? She was kind of like an agent to me. She said you're doing sports physio? Hope to. We'll see. How long you home for? I don't know. I'm waiting for ... A sign? Maybe. I have never been in here. Oh yeah, you left before you were legal. Being legal was never the issue. Oh yeah, well, me either. Thanks. Come on. Tammy Bobammy. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God. I was wondering when you'd be home. Oh, Tam, I'm so sorry, your beautiful mom. Everyone loved her so much. Hang on, I'm coming around. Holy cow, you are about to pop. Cow's right. Seven and a half months. You having twins? Byron, oh my, I am so sorry, Ally. This is my fiancé, and a man, and an idiot. And he's right, I'm having twins, boy and a girl. Wow. Wow, wow. Oh, hi, Dawn, right? I heard you were home. Yep, and this is Banu. Yeah, I know Banu. You were in the same class as Martin, my little brother. Oh yeah, is he good? Great, practically runs Dad's machine shop now. He's here. There, see? Oh yeah. Do you guys wanna grab that table? You should go say hi, be interested to see you. No, he looks busy. I'll send him over. Honestly, we're good. Marty, look who's here. Dawn MacGinnis. Get us a pitcher, okay? Hey, I heard you were back in town, Donald. I think you were on the same bus as Jimbo, right? Yeah, wow. And friends with little Banu. Kinda like a club, eh? Isn't this something, Donnie, after all these years? Dawn. That's what I said. You still playing soccer, Donnie? A bit. Isn't the team thing tricky? Why? Well which side do you play for now? Excuse me, fellas, it's a private party. Sorry, just catching up with our star striker here. He doesn't mind, right? Don used to score and score for our team in high school. Right, Donald? Dawn. That's what I said. Has your hearing gone funny too? What, too? My hearing is great. And it's Dawn, not Donald. And it's she, not he. Whoa, she, come on. Marty, Marty, leave it. Sorry, Tammy. It's fine. Whoops. Gosh, guess we're done here, huh? Come on, ladies. Byron. Fucking asshole. Are you on the tranny train, too, or have you got a cock? Martin, Jesus. I've got a cock. Is that your thing? You calling me a fag? If the wet shoe fits. You're the one wearing jewellery. Jesus. Oh my God. Stop it. Get out! Tammy, why'd you come in here and bring your brother causing trouble? Get him outta here! Her! It's her! God dammit. And I hope that you have the longest labour ever. Dawn. Ally called from the Watering Hole. Dad. Make your choices. Live how you want. But this is my home. You've gotta play the game here. No I don't. Not when the game is stupid and cruel. And if you think how I live is a lifestyle choice, think again. Breakfast? In a bit. Byron, get Jerry a coffee. I'll be right in. We'll do the order list. Yeah, we're nearly outta feed. Going to Stewart's machine shop after breakfast. I thought maybe you'd come. To apologize? It was Marty Stewart who butted Byron last night. Figures, he's been tormenting you since you were eight years old. I told you then you gotta stand up to him. You gotta be a ma ... You can't be a ... He's a coward. And you're not. If you're gonna start on the tractor, you're gonna need some parts. All set. Nancy, thanks for calling. Yeah, yeah, we're okay, thanks. Listen, been looking through invoices and I know we owe ... Yeah Miranda took care of all that. Right. Well two weeks' feed'd be great. Yeah. Thank you, Nancy. Okay, okay, bye. You have reached Gerard Thomas, personal banker. I'm away from my desk, but leave me a message. I'll get right back to you. Gerard, John Andrew, give me a call. Just wonder if there's any room left on the mortgage. Thanks. Bit fancy for the machine shop. Yeah, I don't have a lot of wardrobe choices. Hey, Dawn. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you don't like pancakes, and I'm sorry I used your moisturizer. I thought that it was Mom's. I'm sorry that I said it was fine last night. It wasn't fine. It wasn't my fault, but it wasn't fine. And since I'm gonna spend most of my time apologizing while I'm here, I wonder if we can do like a credit thing. I'll say sorry a dozen times now, and then that'll buy me very fuck-up till I go home. Only a dozen? How soon are you leaving? Ha ha. Do you want me to go? No. Let's stay. Till Dad says he loves us. Till I fix the tractor. Highland Heart Tractor Trials. Well, isn't that like two weeks.

But Miranda said she'd leave with me, and he couldn't lose her, so, I stayed. But he never stopped letting me know I didn't belong. A few years after we were married, I started looking for a tractor. Something bigger that could do more, you know. The big John Deere. Biggest fight we ever had, your mom and me and him. Seeing his tractor shelved was like shelving him, I guess. She just didn't get it. Living on another man's charity. It was his house, his land. She'd say it was mine, too, but it wasn't. I couldn't turn around without he'd ask me why I didn't turn the other way. I get it, you know, but disapproval day after day is enough to break someone. But I did it to you. After her dad died, she asked me if I'd fix it. And I couldn't. I'd look at it, and I'd feel small again. Always trying to be somebody else. So stupid that a thing can make you feel like that. A person made you feel like that. She never asked for much, your mom. For me to fix this tractor and to talk to you. We were going to tell you. I know. It's a different world, Dawn. Five years from when you left, maybe 500. I maybe don't get it, but I don't wish anyone ill, Dawn. Loads of people don't get it, Dad. This thing. Try it out. Turn the key. Pull the choke. Now hit the ignition. Fuck. That's not ladylike. Let me. It's not going for me if it won't go for me. Okay, we'll try it again. Key turn. Choke's out, so just press the ignition.

Yeah, but my mom said to me, and she was smart, too, there's room round the campfire for everyone, and there's a different view from every spot. I remember that. All the time. I love campfires. One more coat. I think so. Can't believe it's done. Mom would be ... Yeah. It's sweet the 4H kids are gonna help with it before the trials. Trials? Yeah, tractor trials. Part of the Highland Heart County Show. It's sort of like a figure skating beauty pageant, but for tractors. Mom drove that tractor in the trials in prehistoric times, like before you, Dad, right? She did. Can I drive it? No. Favourite. So clear. Calling for rain tomorrow. Nah. Look at all those stars. This is nothing. Wait a sec. Whoa, that's like black, black, black. Shooting star.
