You were astral projecting last night, right? Yeah. Don't you think it's kind of strange that you started getting your abilities around the time that I was killed? I think our path's were supposed to cross, man. I mean I'm stuck in this plane, but, you're not. If you can somehow astral project back in time and stop me from going to Maeve's, you can bring me back, man. I can astral project back in time? You are an astral traveler, okay? With your abilities, you can defy the laws of time and space. You can travel to different dimensions if you wanted to. Jay. Dad? You're all grown up. Yeah. There's something you should know, and I don't have much time, all right. Don't astral project anymore. Word got out, about what you did last night. And it's creating a stir on the other side. Do you trust me? Yeah. Come with me. Okay. What are you doing up, Jackson? What is this? Hello? Jackson? Jay, I told you not to astral project anymore. Why didn't you listen? They're trying to reach you. Don't let them in, Jay. Don't let them in! You okay, Uncle Jay? Yeah, yeah. Weird dream. You sure? Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. And I hate to give you bad news over breakfast, but autopsy reports confirm that "Mars Cop" actress, Aura Garcia, died of an overdose of the popular street drug known as party favors, last week in her Los Angeles home. Police are on the lookout for a drug dealer known as Siggy, in connection with her death. The mysterious drug lord had been using Mandao cereal boxes to transport the drug. At this time, we have no official statement from the Mandao cereal corporation. Coming up next, strippers against global warming. It's a shame what that menace is doing to Mandao's name, Uncle Jay. Uh-huh. All right. Y'all are gonna make yourselves useful tonight. I have a very important client coming over. Did you open this? Aura Garcia's manager. After your little Halloween stunt, I decided to have a holiday special of my own. 5% sale on all psychic services. Contacting the dead's been my biggest hit. Well, right after pet telepathy. This guy, Ted Williams, has been hitting me up ever since Aura died, and he's paying big bucks. So, tonight we are making contact with Aura Garcia. You're a charlatan, Andy. You never cease. You never cease. I'm making money, Jay. What are you guys doing? I'm a janitor, cousin Andy, all right. You know that. Okay, well getting fired after two days does not equal a career, Jackson. And I'm not your cousin. Until you guys can afford to pay rent, you both work for me. And take a shower, Jay! You believe the nerve of that guy, Uncle Jay? Move. You still mad at me? Hey, I'm looking for a job, Uncle Jay, all right? When I get it I'm gonna pay you back, I promise. Yeah, you burnt down my apartment. It's popcorn soup, Uncle Jay. It's volatile, but god, it's delicious. Mm-hm. Sometimes I just wanna. I, I wanna. Come on, I need your help in the garage. Wow. This thing looks great, Uncle Jay. What is it? It's called a spirit box. It's for talking to the other side. That's cool. Have you had any luck with it, or? Not yet. But today might be the day. Whoa. Wish me luck. Hello? Is anybody here? I'm trying to reach Raymond Mandao. Dad, if you're here, speak into the radio. Dad! Dad? It's me. Sorry. Damn it. Why can't you just astral project and find your dad? I keep having these dreams where, he tells me not to. This is stupid, he's dead. Aw, come on Uncle Jay. Look, I'm turning it off. Okay, now remember, it's all about atmosphere. We really want Mr Williams to feel like he's having an authentic experience. You're choking me. You're choking me, Andy. There's more where that came from if you fuck this up, popcorn boy. All right, Jay, now I know that you don't astral project anymore, but I think... No, you know what? It's fine, I'm in. What do you need me to do? Oh, okay good. I need you to be my all seeing eye. What the hell does that mean? I need you to help me make Mr Williams think that I can see things that I shouldn't be able to see. Oh, like how many fingers you're holding up. Yeah. Yeah. And some other things too, okay? All right, but I'm not taking sleep mix again, okay? That stuff messes with my brain. You don't have to. I've got something better. This is a special binaural beat. It'll have you in astral form in seconds. Here, put this on and lay down. Okay. Okay, get comfy. Give me your phone. Give me your phone, give me your phone. Thank you. Okay Jay, don't be alarmed. I'm about to call you. Answer his phone. Okay. Testing, testing. Say something, Jay. Hey, hey can you hear me? Yes, yes! It's working. It works! I know, I... No, I mean it's working! Show time. Jackson, go get the door. Jay, meet me in the living room. Welcome to the house of Tarot. Can I take your coat? I'm not wearing a coat. Would you like a coat? No, I don't want a coat. Sweater? What's with your outfit? Uh. You look like a homeless bellhop. Andy. I'll take it from here. Go lay down. Hi Mr Williams. Thanks so much for coming. It's nice to meet you. Come on in. You're Andy, huh? Yes, that's me. What's up with the perv? Um, he belongs to my cousin. Take a seat. Take a seat. Man. Looks like Alec Baldwin's angry stunt double. Now Ted, I know things might seem strange at first, but I want you to know that you've reached out to the right person. But don't take my word for it. Okay. Allow me to demonstrate my power. I will now guess how many fingers you're holding up. Okay, hang on a second. Could you just get Aura, okay? I didn't come here for a little magic show. This is real. I, I don't have a lot of time. It's cool though, just try. It's not cool. Your turban's too tight. Just get Aura on the phone. Okay, just try. How many fingers am I holding up now? He's flicking you off. You're flicking me. Okay, all right. Skip the foreplay, let's just get started. Hang on a second, I'm sorry. Who is it? Someone named Philip. Does Philip know that he's interrupting a very important session right now? No. It's really important to me that I speak to Aura, okay? 'Cause I let her down. I wasn't there for her when she needed me. The one time she needed me. I wasn't there. I want her to know I'm sorry. It's also, the matter of unpaid residuals, you know? I mean "Mars Cop" was very big and I didn't get my mailbox money. So, if you could just get her to give you some information in terms of where my residuals are, that'd be huge. When was the last time you were with Aura? It's, it's been a while, okay? I'm not gonna lie to you. We've had a falling out. Well, Ted, that's all about to change. What? What in the hell is that? This is a spirit box. Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Andy. What are you doing? We call upon the spirit of Aura Garcia. Close your eyes. Concentrate on Aura. Aura, Aura Garcia. - It doesn't work, dude. - Aura. Dude, it doesn't work. Aura Garcia. Hello? It do... Teddy? Yes, yes, Aura. If that's you honey, give us an indication. My god, Aura. Teddy? Teddy? Teddy is that you? She's never called me Teddy in her life. Well, maybe she does now. Aura, Teddy would like you to call him Ted. Yeah, since that's what you've called me the entire time that you've known me. That'd be great. Hi Ted. You shitting me? It's beautiful here. I just got done tanning. You don't have to worry about skin cancer up here. Isn't that beautiful? Jay. Get me outta here. Hold on, Uncle Jay. Are you all right? Oh, my back! Um. Seems like there's some extra spirits in the room. Uh, no, um. What is this? It's a conduit. I think there's a lot of extra spirits in the room and we're just kinda hearing. My ass, this is a walkie talkie that you put inside your spirit box. - No no no! - To make it sound like you were getting Aura. No, they're from another plane. You're a fraud! I swear. Shut up! Hello? Hello, spirit, come in. Mr Williams. Spirit, I'm here. Please, they're just... I told you to shut the fuck up! Hello? Wherever you are, come out. Be quiet Uncle Jay, you're ruining the atmosphere. You're ruining - - My life! Sons a bitches. I knew you were up here! Get the fuck up. Ow, God damn it. Ah, Christ. If I pulled another disc, so help me god, I'm gonna kick your asses. The fuck outta the way! You okay, Uncle Jay? I think I was hallucinating. Sorry Uncle Jay. Get this fucking thing outta here. Sorry. You want a ham and PB&J? No thanks, no. You sure? Yeah, thank you. All right, suit yourself. Damn. This pack must have gone bad. Yeah, it expired in 2016. See those bold letters. Don't eat that. This is pathetic. We gotta get outta here, man. Hey, don't worry, Uncle Jay, I'm talking to my old boss, all right? I'm pretty sure he's gonna take me back and when he does, I know he could use a guy like you. My life is pointless. What do you mean? I've been trying to reach my dad. And I realized something. Why would he want to see me? I'm a loser. I haven't done anything with my life. I have no purpose. Oh come on, Uncle Jay, you know that's not true. What about astral projection? I mean you saved our butts last Halloween. I really think there's a lot of folks you could help out with those abilities. Heck, I'd like to help out right along with ya. We're family, Uncle Jay. We got that. We got it all. You burnt down my apartment, Jackson! I said I'm sorry, all right. Can we drop it? Hello? Hello? Is someone here? Is this the entity from earlier today? Can you hear me? Oh my God, this works. What's your name? I need your help! Hey, where are you going? Keep talking to it. Uh, all right, um. Are you human? Yes. Mm, you sound like a lady, are you single? Oh please, like you have a higher chance with a ghost. Oh no. Binaural track. What are you doing, Uncle Jay? I'm going under. I, I don't think you should. I mean what if it's a bad spirit? If I don't wake up in five minutes, do it for me, all right? I don't know. Jackson, what if this entity needs my help? Okay, give them too me. All right. All right, Uncle Jay, just be careful. I got this. Okay. Hello? My name is Jay Mandao. I come with peaceful intentions. Hey Jay. Hey. You're that actress. Yup, that's me, but don't ask for a selfie, okay? I can't do that over here. Oh, I, I wouldn't I. Selfie's are stupid, so. You know, I've heard about you. You heard of me? Yeah, a lot of people on the other side really want to meet you. They want to meet me, really? Mm-hm. Wow. Wow, I'm a big fan of yours too, actually. Really? Yes. What's your favorite thing that I've done? God, this is, what an opportunity. Uh, uh. Yeah, oh. I can't think of anything right now, but I'll tell you something, it, it was, I like uh, I don't know what it was called. Glad I made an impact. Listen, I need your help. With what? I know everyone thinks that they died before their time, but if anyone's life was cut short, it was mine. You know what I mean? So, I need your help. Hey! Don't say another word, Jay. How long were you waiting there, man? Long enough. I don't like business transactions going on behind my back. Oh my God, it's really you! Aura, I'm a huge fan. I've seen "Mars Cop" like 20 times. I have like two copies. One at home and one for on the go. And one was mine, you borrowed it. I'm sure. Uh, you know, I saw what you guys did with my manager Ted. No no, it's fine. I really don't want to talk to that guy again. He sucked. Ruined my life. Oh, thank God. I mean, that's tragic. Sad. But he is terrible. So is it true about what you did last Halloween? Where you went back in time and prevented someone from dying? Well, uh. Uh, wait a minute, just a minute. Now, we're both pro spirit and everything, but you know, the living still have to make a living. You know what I mean? Okay, I'd pay you, but they don't have banks over here, dude. Well, were you broke when you died? No. Okay, well did you leave money around the house anywhere? Yeah, in my room there's a lock box with like $5,000 in cash. Um, that'll do. I mean, a little cheap for a death reversal, but that'll do. Time of death? Thursday around 11:30 PM. And is there a lock box key, code? No, it's just like this book. I think, "Treasure Island." Okay. Great. Here are the terms. We prevent you from dying. In exchange, we get the money in the lock box. When we wake up, we will look up your address and go from there, won't we? Yeah. Stop saying we, you sound like a French whore. Aura. Deal? Deal. Listen, Aura. My father's name is Raymond Mandao. He's on the other side. If you could help me get in contact with him, I would really appreciate that. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Okay, well do you want to exchange information? Information, that's stupid. We're back in the game, cuz. Andy. How is it supposed to work? When I'm in astral form, I can't, I can't touch anything. Just let me take care of the details, okay? Let's get to work. What is that? What? Calm down. Keep it together. Why are you sneaking up on me like that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jay. Christmas came early this year, baby cousin. My God, you. Did it, did everything work out? Everything worked? Yeah, perfectly. Andy. We're gonna be rich! Hey Fer. Hey. What's all this? Little Christmas cheer. Aren't you going a little crazy here, Jay? I don't think so, I don't think so. Why is he still asleep? He's fine. The more he sleeps, the more I save on food. Yeah, I gotta go. Hey, thanks for the ride. No problem. Also, here's a little tip. Uh, I'm not gonna tickle your pickle, you know? Oh, then give it back. Here. I'm just kidding. I can't, I can't take it. I really can't. Yes you can. Hey, the boys and I are gonna celebrate Christmas, we'd love to have you. Um, I can't. I gotta go 'cause I, I'm thinking of moving, you know? Um, you ever think about moving? All the time. Listen up radiomites, the next caller gets an exclusive pass to our Aura Garcia memorial event happening tonight at 7:00 PM. Rest in peace, Aura, we love you. This is DJ Miguel and you're listening to,. I, I don't know! I don't know what happened, Uncle Jay. Stay where you are. I'm calling the cops. That's a good idea, Uncle Jay. What happened, Jackson? I don't, I don't know. I, I must have done this in my sleep, Uncle Jay. Give me the knife. Give me the knife. Get up. Get up! Move it! I said move. Shit. I'm no good, Uncle Jay. They're gonna give me the chair. Yeah, they probably will. - Really? - Yes. Does it hurt? A lot, Jackson. Hold on, hold on. No! Calm down. No. I gotta think. You're doing the right thing, Uncle Jay. Boys in blue will take it from here. Time to ride the lightening. All right. I'll go back 20 minutes. 20 minutes. I knew something wasn't right. I never should have let you guys live here. Jackson didn't kill you, Andy, he was being controlled by Aura. What, she was here? Yeah she was here. I guess she's still a little dead, huh? What do you want from me, Jay? I've got my own problems right now, okay. I'm really dead, man. Oh my God. I was gonna lose the house. I needed that money. My dad's gonna be so mad. It's okay, it's okay, man. Last night, I got a little ambitious. When you went under, I gave you some sleep mix. Let me guess, it was expired. The whole batch man. I stopped making that crap. You're a dicksuit. Anyway, once you took us back to the night of Aura's death, I sent you back to the present. How did you do that? I set an alarm on your phone so that you'd be pushed back to the present while the sleep mix kept you sedated. You slept like a baby. What the hell! Andy. I'm sorry. I, needed you. I needed you to get me to the past. I can't do that by myself, okay? I tried. Several times. You're the only person I know who can actually do it and it pisses me off! I'm sorry Jay, but seriously it pisses me off! I'm the only one you know who can do it? Don't rub it in. Okay, what happened next? I possessed Jackson. After that it was a pretty simple operation. I found out where Aura lives. I broke in. I got the money. I stashed the money in the garage. And when I woke up it was still there. And you tried to stop her from overdosing, right? I might have been a little late. Oh, you fucked us! You fucked us north! You fucked us south! I'm sorry! You fucked us! I got a little greedy, okay. A little greedy. Well we need to fix this. We need to fix this right now! Yeah, okay, yes. We can, we can fix this. You just have to go back to last week and make sure she lives. Okay, I'll do that. Shut up. Shut up. Looks like I finally got what I deserve, Uncle Jay. You're not dead, you're astral projecting. Awesome! Oh, cousin Andy's alive too, huh? No, he's dead. Oh. You were possessed by a ghost, Jackson. The actress? I mean, why would she do that? We don't know, we don't know. That's what we're trying to figure out. We need your help, buddy. You got it, Uncle Jay. Okay. You guys need to go back to last Thursday, then y'all need to possess each other. Oh, I don't know, cousin Andy, it sounds evil. No no no! It's the easiest way, Jackson. Otherwise we're stuck communicating with radios and that can be spotty. All right. All right, how do we do this? Okay, it's actually pretty simple. Instead of astral projecting to a place, you astral project into a person. As long as both bodies are sleeping, you should be able to just kind of merge with them. Ew, yucky. It's really easy. It's like jumping in the driver's seat. It's just like stealing a car. Sounds illegal, cousin Andy. Then it's just like renting a car, Jackson. Whatever. We go back in time, last Thursday, 11:00 P, 11:00 PM. Whoa, how's it do that? It's always fun when it - Let's go. Guys. Okay, we'll be back, Andy. Thank you. Here goes nothing. Copy that. I'm getting blisters on my feet. Where's Fer when you need her? Geez, Uncle Jay, you got some hairy legs. Yeah, Jackson? You're in cuddles with a cop uniform, okay? She's never gonna believe this. This is from a few Halloween's ago, okay? We had to improvise. Yeah, you're a dicksuit. What's the plan? Put it away, Jackson, before I take it away. Come on, let's go. Turn it off, Jackson. Would you just, would you, just stand there. Just stand there. Police, open up! Shit! Jackson, put it away. Jackson, put it away. Put it in your God damned pocket, Jackson. Ma'am, we got a call about a possible disturbance on the premises. Get on the ground, now! Oh my God. Hey, you can't do this! I have rights! Oh, you want rights? You want rights? You can't have any rights! Am I right, Uncle Jay? Calm down, Jackson. Sorry bout that, sorry. Sorry, ma'am. What the hell? Why are you wearing cutoffs? Miss Garcia, we know you have the drugs, okay? So you might as well just hand them over. Either that or we're gonna take you down to the station, so it's your choice. I'm not doing anything until I speak to my lawyer, pig! That's it, you earned this. What is with you? Sorry about that, Uncle Jay. Sometimes I just get, amped! Yeah. Yeah, I guess you do, huh? Geez, these are pretty tight. Yeah, I gained a little weight, Jackson, okay? You insisted on wearing 'em. Sorry about that, Uncle Jay. Yeah yeah. What's next? Hey, hey, help me find. Pay attention. Help me find the drugs, okay? All right, let's do this. Yeah, let's go. Wow, nice tapestry. Good craftsmanship. Oh wow, "Mars Cop." This cop is about to see red. God, everybody's seen that movie. Oh, it's a great one, Uncle Jay. Would you get that light outta my face, Jackson? Help me find the drugs. Okay. Hey bring that light over here, Jackson. Oh, there it is. Nice work! Come on, let's go! Fer! Why was Fer here, Uncle Jay? I don't know. Come on. Would you just back up? We gotta start workin' out, Jackson. Yeah we do, Uncle Jay. I just got myself a gym membership recently. You did what? Got a gym membership. On my dime? Hey, you can be a guest. Jack, would you get that light outta my face, Jackson. It was a one click trick. What's that? That's payment. Come on, let's get outta here. Andy! What? Okay. You're alive. You're alive. You okay, Jackson? No. No, I'm not Uncle Jay, I had this bad dream last night. I dreamt that we were, we were at Aura's house and we were all dying. And there was, there was somebody else there, too, but I can't, I can't remember. Ted? Who's Ted? Okay I, I think it's time I filled you guys in on everything. - Wow. - Wow. You weren't kidding? No. I can't believe you were inside me, cousin Andy. Me neither. And I'm not your cousin. I think I know why Fer was there that night. Aw, cool. Don't. Ay! Ow! - Stop it. - Let me see it. Stop! Hey! Care to explain this, Fer? Or should I call you Siggy? What the hell are you talking about? You know, this really isn't a good look for you, Jay. Look, I'm not Siggy, I'm his successor, okay? Okay. Not so fast. All right! I used to drive the real Siggy to his client's houses. And then one night, after a few deliveries, I looked in the back of my car and he was gone. Oh my God! So what happened? Did he go get a pack of smokes, or something? He OD'd on his product. Oh. But he left behind a shit load of drugs. Look, I'm tired of being a Bum Ride driver, okay? So I saw an opportunity and I took it, okay? So shut up. What'd you do with the body? Yeah, what did you do with the body? I left it on his porch with a bag of party favors. Okay, look, what was I supposed to do? Give the drug dealer a proper burial? Come on. Well, this was a nice touch. I'm sorry about that, Jay. I actually am sorry about that. But you have to admit that was good branding, right? Look, when I became Siggy, it felt good. But I'm done with all that. I haven't answered her calls since last week, so I'm out. Hey Uncle Jay, why do you think we had the same dream? Maybe it was a shared premonition. And if it was, we could all be in danger. Along with Aura's manager. Ted? What? Last time I was at her house, she was telling me about this club called the Population. It's this cult where they initiate new members by making them do rituals and stuff. I have been busting my ass for so long and it's like, I never have, I never have any fucking money. Why? But things are about to change, Siggy. Wanna know a secret? I guess. I think I'm about to make it big. Like, really big. Good for you. Shit. You know, fuck man. Hollywood is a sick place, and you would know that, look at you. You don't get to the top unless you sacrifice. And I really mean that. You have to sacrifice someone. These actors in the $20 million club, they didn't get to where they are without having sacrificed something. Someone. I think you're taking that too literally. No I'm not. Have you ever heard of the Population? Is that a band? It's a club. All these celebrities, all these A listers are a part of it. It's like I can't even name people. But you know them, okay? And on Christmas Eve, at midnight, it's gonna be official. I'm gonna be one of them. I am ready to sacrifice. Cool. And I cannot think of anyone more deserving than my manager Ted, he's perfect. The little piece of shit. You wanna know what he said to me? This, I can't believe it, he said, "You're worth more dead than alive." And with posthumous CGI and record sales and shit. You sing? No, I suck. He's just a sociopath. Police, open up! Oh shit! Then the cops showed up and I booked it outta there. I thought she was just stoned. So that's it. Aura's gonna try to kill her manager tonight before midnight. Okay, stop, stop. Everyone, we fixed this, all right? Can we just move on? We fixed everything, all right? What do you mean you fixed everything? Fer, I'm an astral traveler. So is Andy. And Jackson too I guess, I don't know. Point is, we traveled back in time, we messed some stuff up but we fixed it, okay? Jackson and I possessed each other. We were the cops that night. That's how we knew you were there, okay? That's what happened. I've heard weirder things. You guys, maybe Jay's right. I mean, we're up five grand, no one is dead. Maybe we should just leave it alone. Now wait just a minute, cousin Andy. We shared a dream that something bad was gonna happen. Uncle Jay, that means something. What's the matter with you guys, huh? You got your money, and that's all that matters? For all we know, an innocent man is gonna meet his maker tonight. And we can stop it. Uncle Jay, you wanna know what your purpose is? This is it? You're right, Jackson. Yeah. Ted's a prick, but he's innocent. We could really use all the help we can get. Yes. Come on, cousin Andy. Mandao boys, right? I'm out. Oh, come on cousin Andy! No, you come on, Jackson. I just got my life back. I'm not trying to lose it again! Cousin Andy. I'm not your cousin. Well. Let's go over it again. Fer contacts Aura to sell some party favors. But instead of the real thing, it's powdered candy. Right. After she inhales it, Jackson employs the viper hand and she's out like a light. Then Jackson puts headphones on her and plays the binaural track. When she's in the astral realm, she'll think she's dead and I'll be there to make sure she doesn't wake up too soon. Then we book it out of there. When her alarm clock goes off, it'll be past midnight. There won't be a need to kill Ted, and she'll be so happy she's alive she'll never do drugs again. Mission accomplished. That's a great plan, Uncle Jay. Thank you. Yeah, that sounds like a real half baked plan, Jay. Oh, it's a half baked plan for, what was your plan again? Shut up. It's a good plan, Jay, it'll work. Thank you. All right. All right, father fuckers, let's go. Greetings to you Population hopeful. By midnight tonight, we will see if you have what it takes to join us. If you are unable to complete your initiation task, you will be irrevocably banned from joining the Population. Any attempt to alert the authorities of our operations will result in severe consequences. Remember, we know all your secrets. There is no need to send proof of your sacrifice. We know where you are and we will be watching. Shit. You guys ready? - Yeah. - I think so. All right, be careful. You too, Jay. You ready? Let's boogie. All right. Get in here. Siggy, do you mind if I owe you? I was robbed last week and I mean, I'll pay you back in a couple days, I swear. Yeah, no problem. Thanks. You wanna do a line? Tonight's been crazy and I'm ready to blow my brains out. All right. I mean we have to do it quick, 'cause I need to be somewhere soon. Yeah. After you. Okay. Thanks. Went down the wrong tube. What the hell? It tastes like sugar. Ow! Ouchy! Hey, you're that fake cop who took my money. Where's my fucking money? Plan B, Fer, plan B. You idiot! There's no plan B! You're in on this too, Siggy? Put the headphones on, bitch! I'm not putting on no fucking headphones! Yes you are! Bitch! Oh! Ow, shit. Ow! Shit, that hurt. Wake up! Your friends are going to die! Now wake up! Wake up! Well, it's not every day that two perfectly good sacrifices walk right into my house. It was meant to be. And I can't wait to kill you, Siggy. Oh shit! Fuck. I'll be right there, Ted. Shut up! Fuck. Come on. Andy! Andy! Hey. Hey, Ted what are you doing here? I came by to say hello, Merry Christmas. How are ya? That's great. Right now's not a good time, so. I can, can I just use your bathroom real quick? I mean it'll just take a minute. - Uh. - I had some paella, or something's gone right through me, seriously. Wow. Okay. This is weird. Your place. It's Christmas time, no decorations up. There's no tree, there's no lights, nothing? I don't celebrate Christmas. How can you not celebrate Christmas? 'Cause I don't. I'm busy. Yeah, I can see you're busy. Got quite a little party going on here for yourself. Ted, what are you doing here? Wow, is that bad cocaine. Ted, please, just. Why? Why am I here? Uh-huh. What? I'm here because I want you to know something, and that is that people care about you. Ted, why are you here? I want my money. - Oh. - No. Hang on a second. Those residuals are something that, I'm coming. We talked, this is shit. We've talked about this. I called you three times yesterday. You don't return phone calls. Where are you guys?
