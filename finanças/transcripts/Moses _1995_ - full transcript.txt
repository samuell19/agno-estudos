[screaming] [baby crying] [baby continues crying] It is a male. (captain) Pharaoh has decreed death for all Hebrew newborn males. [screams] [continues screaming] (soldier #1) I'll see to it. [soldiers chattering] (soldier #2) it's the best way. Miriam. [baby wailing] (soldier #2) At least they die quickly. [baby crying] [baby cries] [baby continues crying] [maids chattering] [baby crying] [people chattering] [all gasp] Moses. Ptira, come and get your adopted son. Teach him to stay on his feet. Mermefta. My son. (officer) Are you ready, Mermefta? Moses? Ready. (officer) Begin. [grunting] [grunting] Moses! [grunts] [drum beating] [drumming stops] We greet Pharaoh as we greet the sun. Pharaoh is Egypt. (all) Egypt is Pharaoh. We offer praise to you on the commemoration of the day that the great god Ra gave all Egypt the gift of our Pharaoh, Ramses. I love birthdays. Especially my own. [all laugh] And how does my family mark this special occasion? (Tuntmin) We all bring offerings to you, God on earth, the sun that lights our lives. I offer praise to my father on this great day. You have done well, my daughter. And what does your son bring? Moses, are you here? Moses! (Moses) I'm here, your majesty. I had a game made for you, Great Egypt. Speak up, Moses, I can't hear you. A... a game. [people snicker] This is very fine woodwork, Moses. I didn't know that you were so good with your hands. No, Great Egypt. I did not make the game myself. It was made by a Hebrew cra-craftsman at my request, especially for you. A Hebrew? I have never been very skilled at games, Moses. Are you? No, Great Egypt. Moses is too humble, Great Egypt. He defeats me in riddles quite often. You let him win, Tuntmin, as you do with me. Ne-never. Are you good at riddles, my son? I have one for you, father. When is an Egyptian not an Egyptian? (Pharaoh) I don't know, my son. When? Oh, I'm sorry. I've forgotten the answer, father. Then it's not a very good riddle, is it? Well, I'm sure there are those in the court who know the answer. (Pharaoh) well, when you do know the answer, ask it again. Yes, father. And now my gift for you. [people exclaiming] [people chattering] A model of the great statue I'm building in honor of my father, Great Egypt. (Mermefta) Ramses. Prepare the chariots. I wish to see where my son has decreed that I shall stand through the centuries. [chisels tapping] [slaves grunting] [slaves panting] (guard #1) put that back in the cart! Here, have some water. (guard #2) you, work harder! [Hur grunting] [sighs] Get up, get up, they'll see you. Just rest here for a moment. No, Aaron, Oh, if they see me lying here, they will beat me. Just rest. Lazy Hebrew, will it take a beating to make you work? No! You dare interfere, Hebrew? (taskmaster) No, leave him! The Pharaoh himself arrives. [bugle blowing] Get to your knees, Hebrew. The great Ramses is within sight. [guards shouting] (guard) Down on your knees! (guard #3) Shut your eyes! (guard #2) On your knees. (taskmaster) Pharaoh is Egypt! (slaves) Pharaoh is Egypt! Egypt is Pharaoh! Egypt is Pharaoh! Pharaoh is Egypt. Pharaoh is Egypt. Egypt is Pharaoh. Egypt is Pharaoh. (taskmaster) Back to work. (guards) Back, move, move. [chisels continue tapping] Moses, you shouldn't come here. You say that every time I come, and every time I come, your eyes tell me what a terrible liar you are. Please, Moses, they... they mustn't see me being idle. They won't bother you, they won't bother you. (guard #1) Get up! How are you? I am well, Moses. [guards continue shouting] And you? Oh, I want for nothing. Except... Except? I have to go. Expect me tonight. Goodbye, Moses. (guard #2) Give him a hand over there. Come on, quickly, hurry! You're not Hebrew, Moses. You sucked at the breast of a Hebrew. Nothing else. You are an Egyptian prince, Moses. Be proud. Why? Because Egyptians are powerful? No. Because it's what you are. I'm not Egyptian, nor Hebrew. I'm nothing. Moses! Don't speak this way, or you shall offend the gods. Which gods? Oh, the gods that you teach me to worship or the god that Jochabed loves? Jochabed was your wet nurse, nothing more. She lies if she says she was more. She tells me nothing more. [sighs] But I know the truth. The truth is that I am your mother. You are a royal prince of Egypt. I'm nothing! Pharaoh knows it, the court knows it, the nation knows it. Only you pretend, mother. (guard #1) Move along. (guard #2) All right. [man chattering] (man #1) Keep moving. I want to get home. (Aaron) No! You thought you're gonna get away with it, didn't you? No, master, please, I meant no harm! You made me look like a fool. No! [grunting] [panting] Moses. You've killed him. You've killed an Egyptian. Aaron. (Aaron) Keep digging, Hur. (Aaron) It's not deep enough. Come on, pick up the body. [Aaron grunting] (Aaron) Cover it with some mud. Quickly. (Moses) We have to go. We must cover him. (Aaron) Leave him. You saved my life. Why? Why? You're my brother, Aaron. God be with you, Moses. [Moses exclaims] (Aaron) What do you want here? I want to see my mother. Moses, no. You don't belong here. You're Egyptian. (Jochabed) Aaron. I'm here to see my mama. Moses, no. I'm here, my son. Mother. [Jochabed crying] Forgive me, Moses. [Moses sniffling] It was my only way to save you from the sword of Ramses. I am Hebrew? You are whatever you choose to be, Moses. God has given you a choice he has given to no other man. But I've taken it away. What do you mean? Why are you wearing these rough clothes? - I'm leaving Egypt. - Leaving? Tonight. Didn't Aaron tell you? (Jochabed) Aaron? I have so many questions, But now, I must go. God saved you, Moses. Serve him well. [wind howling] [birds chirping] [goat bleating] [women laughing] [sheep bleating] (shepherd) Hup-hup. [shepherd whistling] [sheep continue bleating] Fill the trough. Drive the flock forward. But, Zipporah, father said not to look for trouble. He doesn't have to spend half of every day. Waiting until the men are through. They have struck us before, Zipporah. They'll do it again. Fill the trough. (Batim) Come. [Midan whooping] [men laughing] (Midan) Ooh, see how fortunate we are? The priest's daughters have filled the trough for our flock. You are mistaken. The water is for my father's flock. Really? Well, Jethro's sheep can wait. [men laugh] Perhaps. But my sisters and I can't. Drive the flock forward. Do as I say. [yelling] [screaming] [men laugh] [grunts] I, uh... May I drink at your well? Thank you. If you would drink, you'd better ask my permission. Nobody makes a fool of me. You ignore me at your peril, stranger. Now there's no point in strutting for the sisters. You're 1 and we are 4. What's your name, shepherd? Midan. What's yours? Moses, son of Ptira, daughter of Ramses. [men laugh] Ramses. Look inside my cloak. My cloak. Egyptian. It's Egyptian army. I serve Ramses himself. His army can probably be seen from the top of that ridge. They'll need lambs to eat. Now, shall we take your sheep. Or those of the women? Move the sheep, move the sheep. Quick. (shepherd) Hup-hup-hup. [shepherds whistling] [laughing] What did you say to him that made him so afraid? [sighs] You're shaking, yet you're brave. Why? I was not brave. (Zipporah) You were brave. Why? I was angry. Sometimes... Well, he knocked you down. That was wrong. My father is Jethro. He's the priest of Midian. He'll be grateful. (Batim) Hup-hup-hup. Well, uh, I'll be on my way. Oh, but my father... No, it's b... It's best. Go well. You're back soon. Oh, father, father! An Egyptian stopped Midan from taking our place at the trough. An Egyptian? Or a gang of them? No, father, just one. But a very brave one. Is that him? (Jethro) He deserves a show of gratitude. I asked him to stay, father, but... Go fetch him, daughter! [laughing] (Jethro) My, what great pleasure it is for me to have another man at my table. My life is surrounded by women. [Jethro chuckles] A father needs a son amongst his family. As you saw today at the well, we live in a time of rough men with little respect for women. I'm a priest to the people of Midian, which lies just beyond the ridge. What gods do you worship, Moses? In Egypt, we have many gods. The Hebrew slaves have only one. Yes. You know of him? Is he above other gods? I haven't heard much of his power for many years. My wet nurse, my... my Hebrew wet nurse, she says that he will deliver them from slavery. From the Egyptians? [Jethro chuckles] That will be an act of great power. You're a man of many fascinating thoughts and ideas, Moses. But not many words. [all laughing] It would be worth our while to persuade you to stay for a time. There's no better kitchen in the entire region. Zipporah makes sure of that. And no one weaves finer fabric than we do. Also under Zipporah's eye. They exaggerate, Moses. I'm... I'm sure it's all true, all of it, but I... I must be on my way. East? Mostly barren land. What towns do exist rarely welcome strangers. Why not stay here, until you have a better idea of where you're headed? Yes, please stay, Moses. Please. You're very kind, but... Good, good, that's agreed, eh. [all laughing] [all laughing] [birds chirping] [pipes blowing] [drums beating] [people cheering] [people laughing] A full day has passed since great Pharaoh has shown any sign of mortal spark. Let Egypt rejoice. My father has rejoined the gods of the other world. Give thanks to great Pharaoh. The sun and moon live in him. (Mermefta) Arise. Tuntmin, you may look upon me. Egypt's people shall mourn for one full phase of the moon while the holy embalmers prepare my father for his journey to the other world. As it is said, so shall it be done. Then I shall take my place on the sun throne. As it is said, so shall it be done. (Mermefta) Good. Let the mourning begin. [clucking] [bleating] - You counted them? - I have. - Every one? - Every one. (Zipporah) Dried lamb, bread, dates, and the water. (Jethro) Is that enough for you? Oh, it's 2 or 3 days. I'll see them settled for summer grazing, then I'll... I'll return. Take care. I will, I will. Beware of the wolves. I will. [kid bleating] Yes, you've lost your mum. You've lost your mama. Strange. No lightning. Let's go and see. Come, let's go and see. You burn, but the flames don't consume you. [kid continues bleating] (God) Moses. Moses. Here I am. Remove your sandals for the place where you stand is holy ground. [bleating] Be at peace. I am the god of your fathers, Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob. Why do you come to me? I have heard the cry of my people, Israel. I will send you to the Pharaoh, And you shall free my people from Egypt. Why me? A man cl-clumsy with words. Who am I to go before the Pharaoh? I will be with you. If I go to the Israelites and say that God has sent me, They won't believe me. They'll ask, "What is his name?" I am who I am. They won't listen. Wh-why should they? They'll seek signs. That rod, cast it to the ground. Aah! [hissing] Grasp it by the tail. [continues hissing] Now put your hand under your cloak. Now withdraw it. Oh, no. Now replace your hand and then withdraw it. This will be the sign that you speak with the voice of the Lord their God. Please. Oh, Lord. Not me, not me, not me. I-I've never been a man of words. Not in times past, not no-now. E-even as you s-speak to me, I'm s-I'm still, I'm still... I'm still of speech! Your brother, Aaron, will meet you and you will be my voice to him, and he will speak for you to the people. [bleating] Jethro! Jethro! Moses! [grunting] Maybe I was dreaming or mad from the sun. Or perhaps God spoke to you. Why would God speak to me? Why me? Why not you? Because I don't know God, I know nothing of God! In Egypt they have many gods. Which god spoke to you? The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Ab... But you're Egyptian. No. I'm Hebrew. I had 2 mothers. I came from the womb of Jochabed, a Hebrew slave. But I was raised up by Ptira, daughter of Ramses himself. Ramses? Both mothers. Spoke to me of God, but... I've yet to find my god, I can't find him, I can't find him. God doesn't speak to anyone. He knows your heart. Even a murderer? Does he speak to murderers? Does he know the heart of a murderer? What are you saying? Moses? In Egypt I killed a man. It's why I ran. It's why I came here. They... ...killed so many of them. Of us! And I survive. And I kill! I know nothing of this. But I do know, God speaks for a purpose, And you heard your God's voice. Did I? Are you mad? Are you mad? No, you're not. You saw the bush. You heard the voice. God has spoken to you. Has he? Did he not give you a sign? Did he not change your staff into a serpent as you told us? As I told you. It was God. Was it? Was it? Was it, was it, was it? Was it? Was it God? What could be more real than the call of God? What if it is true? Can you live without testing the truth? [wind blowing] [breathing heavily] Did I see God, Zipporah? Only you can answer that, Moses. If I go back to Egypt, as the voice has commanded, they may kill me. Not if God is with you. Not if he is sending you to free your people. I can't even talk in the presence of the Pharaoh. I can't talk. It is a true call. You must answer it. They may kill your husband. I will trust in God. Will you? God be with you. [stick clattering] Aaron. Aaron, my brother. Oh, Moses. How I've missed you. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. [crickets chirping] What are you doing here in the middle of the desert? [laughs] God called me to come to you. God? He spoke to me, too. I know. [women shouting] [donkey braying] [people chattering] Moses has returned! Moses has come back! What are you doing? I must let the people know you're here, Moses. Why? You are sent by God to free his people. - But what if... - Moses. Blessed is the day God chooses to free his people from bondage. That day has come with your arrival. The people will want to know. Moses. It has begun. Moses has arrived! Moses has returned! Moses is God's messenger! He has been chosen by God to lead his people out of bondage. Behold the deliverer! Moses. Miriam. Moses. My brother. Miriam. Moses has come back as a messenger of God to free his people from the Egyptian bondage. Come, we'll show you, come. (Aaron) Come, gather round, all of you! Come gather! Moses has returned as God's messenger. Gather around. Witness the power of God through Moses. Moses. [goat bleating] A few weeks ago, I was on Mount Sinai. (man) Speak up! A few weeks ago, I was on Mount Sinai. God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, came to me and asked me to return to Egypt to lead you, His chosen people, out of bondage into a land of milk and honey. (Zerack) Moses. Moses the Egyptian. I was raised in an Egyptian family, but I'm Hebrew by birth. An Egyptian family. You were raised by the daughter of the Pharaoh himself. I believe God asked me to return to lead you out of slavery. Do you? And why do you believe this, Egyptian? Here is a sigh God gave me. [people gasp] [women scream] (man) Moses. [hissing] [people chattering] A magic trick. No. The hand of God. And there is more. [people gasp] [people exclaim] (Aaron) These are the signs of God. Moses has been called to lead us out of bondage. And why would God call an Egyptian? Moses is my brother, and you know it. He's the son of our departed mother Jochabed. But he was raised in the way of Egypt. Do you question God's ways? These are the signs of God! Proof that he's heard us. Proof that he has come back to us. Have we followed the way of God through all this, to desert him when he hears us? [singing in Hebrew] [singing in Hebrew] [all sing] Great Egypt, I beseech you, show mercy to this man. My chief steward says I should show you mercy. But he's too soft. Your tax will be paid or your life is forfeited. (Tuntmin) Next. Come forward. Plead before Great Egypt. You see, steward? A steady hand and complaints disappear. Now if there's no more business... [guards shouting] Who are you to enter my courtroom? I'll have your head. I am Moses. Moses? Well, I knew a man by that name once, but he left under cover of night. God has demanded my return. So, adopted son of Egypt, from time to time we wondered where you were. In... ...d-distant lands. Very d-distant, I'm sure. [people snickering] I expected your return for Ptira's entombment out of gratitude to your Egyptian mother. I knew nothing of her passing. And who is this? I am Aaron, the Levite, brother of Moses, Great Egypt. Great Egypt. Exactly right. So how do you dare to come before me? I do as Moses instructs, sire. As Moses instructs? Why did you not tell me, steward, that there are those other than myself who command the acts of people in my kingdom? I had no idea there was another authority, sire. May I be forgiven? Moses. How dare you show your face before me, huh? Tsk, tsk, tsk. It is not by choice, Pharaoh. I come only because the Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has asked me to speak his message. Do you hear, steward? A wretch in shepherd's clothes, speaks of a God great enough to decide to whom I, God on earth, must give audience. But our god, the God of Israel, has shown himself to us. And these are his words. He says: "Let my people go, "so they may celebrate a festival to me in the wilderness." I should have you both killed for daring to come before me, but your blood is unworthy of me. If Hebrew you must be, so be it. Go, Moses, take your brother. Live with the slaves, live there. Then come back and speak to me of your god. Steward! Sire? We can't have slaves dreaming of journeys to the wilderness. Egypt needs their sweat. Increase their workload. Have them gather their own straw for the bricks they make. Then demand the same number of bricks be made each day. Then we'll see if deceitful promises distract them. (guard #1) More straw! (guard #2) Work harder! (guard #3) Use your strength. Who is their foreman? You, Zerack! Kneel before the steward of Great Egypt. You failed to meet the prescribed quota of bricks today and yesterday. We try, master, but now we have to gather our own straw. As hard as we work, the quota is never reached. We only want to serve great Pharaoh. Then explain why you sent him Moses to beg that you be allowed 3 days in the wilderness. I sent no one, master. I beg of you. Ask Great Egypt to lift this burden. You will produce your quota of bricks or you'll be beaten. Hold him. Guards. [grunts] Beat him. [grunts] [grunts] [grunts] [grunts] I don't understand it. I knew they wouldn't listen to me. Why should God cause greater suffering? More hardship? (Zerack) Moses! Look upon this, prophet. Moses plays us for fools. There are no voices. Look at him, the false prophet. Hold your tongue, Zerack. It was not you under the lash, nor was it Moses. The Pharaoh lets Moses sit and watch while the rest of us work until we die! To make you jealous of him. Hold that sharp tongue, woman. I'm sorry, Zerack. I believed God spoke to me. Hah! God called you, Moses. Don't doubt. If you are not convinced, then how are we to believe it? Your doubts won't stop Zerack from plotting against you. You better do something, brother. Quickly. Fill me with belief, Lord. Fill my arms, fill my hands, fill my tongue. [music playing] [women laughing] [people chattering] [drums beating] [flute playing] [snake hisses] [music continues playing] [music stops playing] Again, Moses, such insolence to look upon my face. Why are you here? As part of my entertainment? [people laughing] We come with the word of God. He bids you, let his people go. Oh, does he really? Well, that doesn't fit with my plan, Hebrew. Ask him to wait, will you? Are you so sure that I'm a fool and a fake that you'd risk his wrath? Risk? [all gasp] [hisses] Great lord! [hisses] [people laugh] [crowd exclaims] Now hear me, For God fills my tongue. The Lord, God of Israel bids you, Let his people go. No one. No one bids Great Egypt, God on earth, anything! Anything! (Pharaoh) Come here. [clicking tongue] Ooh. [cooing] Behold, a prince of Egypt, heir to the throne. (all) Hail, prince of Egypt. And now I must bathe in the Nile as a gift of thanks, yes, to Amun. [guard shouting] Stop! [neighing] (Aaron) Stop! Hear now! The voice of the Lord, God of Israel. He bids you let his people go! Blood. Blood. There will be blood throughout the whole of Egypt for 7 days. The fish will die. The rivers will stink of death. Through Moses, the Lord says: "Know by this that I am the Lord." The Lord bids Pharaoh, "Let my people go." Or... ...he will fall upon you with pestilence and the sword. No work today. Rest. Be at peace with your families! [slaves cheering] No work today for any of us. [laughs] The Nile is undrinkable. Every single Egyptian across the entire land is scratching at the earth for water. Moses. Moses. You were right. And surely now, Pharaoh will let us go. Is it to be that simple? Well, isn't it? God warns us the Pharaoh's heart is hard. This will not be won easily. Great Egypt, your priests have an answer. Show me. Great lord. [chanting] You see? The Hebrew's trick is easily performed. And our agents in your upper kingdom report that the waters of great Nile are now clean and sweet as they flow downriver towards us. Before 7 days have passed, this plague will be only memory. Good. Put the Hebrews back to work. They must make up for the work lost by these games of Moses. [rooster crowing] [frogs croaking] [shouts] [laughs] (Pharaoh) I suppose you and your god take credit for this. If you do not believe this, then why did you call us before you? Lift this plague. I'm tired of these games your god plays. Will you let the Lord's people go? Yes! Yes. But lift this plague. Great lord... Silence! I want peace. Get these frogs away. Take your people to the wilderness for your sacrifice. I have spoken. Here you are, go on. [people chattering] This is our day of freedom! (man) Praise be to god, Zerack. We are leaving. We are leaving. Ready? Let's go. [people chattering] Truly, Moses, you are a prophet of God! I never thought to see the day we would be gone from Egypt. You will. Will? [soldiers shouting] [women screaming] Out of my way. Fool. Did you think Pharaoh would be compelled by a silly trick? To your labors. To your labors! You said Pharaoh released us. Line up for work. Today is no different from any other day. You lied, Moses! You lied! Line up for work! You lied, Moses. This is your vanity. This is your vanity! [people shouting] The Lord must try Israel even as he afflicts Egypt. The people are righteous! Listen to the people! (Zerack) I believed you, Moses! (Korah) Vanity! Moses, all your tricks will not convince me to release Egypt's work force. It is God's will that you let his people go. And who will do the work? Your god? Moses, your people cannot survive in freedom, you know that. You understand the system. I cannot expect your brother here to understand, but you do. Slaves are slaves, Moses. They're happiest being slaves. Thus says the Lord, "Let my people go "so that they may worship me. "For by now I could have stretched out "my hand and struck you and your people, "but I have let you live to show my power "and to make my name resound through all the earth.” My name resounds through all the earth and I have let you live. Moses, let me put you in charge of the Jews. Huh? You can look after them. You can care for them. But they must stay. They can worship who they like. I've never interfered with their god. Send everything you have in an open field to a secure place. Every human and every animal will die when the hail comes. Hail? Hail? We are in a desert! Open the doors! You are a madman, Moses, do not come before me again. Do you hear me? Never, never again! [wind howling] [thunder cracking] If your powers are less than a slave god's, what good is your service or your lives? Great Egypt, what can be lost by allowing them to worship in the wilderness? Because once there, they'll never return. They'll move on! A horde of people on our eastern flank, a threat to Egypt! But what greater threat can Egypt face than these plagues? They're great magic, my lord. The omens tell us that while we keep the Hebrews, we will have no peace. Enough! Enough! [locusts buzzing] [men screaming] Egypt is ruined. The barley is in the ear, the flax in bud, The locusts will eat it all. The hand of the Lord. Blessed be his name. He is still upon us. Moses, now will the Pharaoh's heart soften? If God sees us ready for freedom. If not, he will harden the Pharaoh's heart and we will remain slaves. We will leave this place when Egypt finally understands the power of the Lord. You pray to him that you'll be ready for that day when it comes. (Moses) Fear not! God will not let them harm the children of Israel. You may go. And all your people with you. Egypt has decided it no longer. D-desires you in our midst. When the Lord lifts the disease from your body, will your heart harden again? I want you gone. All of you. Only your flocks and your herds will remain. The Lord bids all our possessions go with us. How else will we have what we need to make sacrifice to him to show our thanks? It is to me you owe your gratitude. You go. Your flocks remain. All of us. Stop. (Moses) Our young, our old, our flocks, our herds. Or you'll face a plague worse than anything the Lord has thus far shown you. Not one more word of this foolish god you boast of. If your flocks are so dear to you, stay with them here in Egypt. Think carefully on this. How dare you instruct me! Get out of my sight! Be gone and take care never to look upon my face again! For if ever I see your face one more time, Moses, I will kill you! I will kill you. [panting] How long, oh, Lord? How long? (Moses) And with this last plague, the Lord will break the Pharaoh's conceit and teach us the terrible price of freedom. Mark well, now what I say to you. On the 10th day of this month, Each family will take a yearling lamb without blemish. You will watch over this lamb until the 14th day of the month, At which time, the entire assemblage of Israel will gather. (Moses) And at twilight on that day, you will slaughter the lamb. [sheep bleating] Take some of the lamb's blood and put it on the doorposts of your houses. The lamb's blood will be a sign. When the Lord sees the blood, he will pass over you, and you will not be harmed when he strikes the land of Egypt. You will eat of the lamb the same night. It must not be raw or cooked with water, only roasted. And you shall eat it with your clothes on your back. And a staff in your hand. You'll not take time to leaven your bread. This will be known as the feast of unleavened bread. And you will eat this passover offering hurriedly, for at midnight, the Lord shall go forth among the Egyptians, and the lord will punish the gods of Egypt. But the blood on the houses where you are will be a sign. For when he sees the blood, he will pass over you. [people shouting] [women wailing] [people crying] [sniffles] [crickets chirping] Look what you have done to my son. (Pharaoh) Your god is evil. Evil. Go away from my people. Take your flocks, take your herds. And be gone. (Pharaoh) Moses. I have let you go. Bring a blessing on me. Please. [door closing] [people chattering] (Moses) Remember this night on which you came out of Egypt. Out of the house of slavery. Because the Lord brought you out with the strength of his hand. Go forth, oh, Israel. Oh, Israel! Go forth! [Hebrew song playing] [people chattering] [goat bleating] [goat bleating] [people chattering] The people wonder, Moses. About what? Why we take this route. This leads to the Red Sea. South lies a clear path to the east, to the land of Canaan. We take the route the Lord ordains. [women sobbing] Tuntmin. What have I done, letting Israel leave our service? It was a wise decision, Great Egypt. Where are they now? Approaching the sea, but I caution. They must pay for this. Prepare a company of our army. Is this a game, Moses? Did you bring us out of Egypt so that we could swim to the promised land? I've done as the Lord instructed. You must do likewise. (Palti) Moses! They're coming, the Egyptians! With Pharaoh at their head. An army of soldiers and chariots. Save us. How far back? How far behind are they? Half a day. (man) Half a day? Half a day? He'll find a way. Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you've brought us here to die in the wilderness? It would've been better to have served the Egyptians than to die in the desert. The Lord has shown us the way. If we follow it, he will deliver us. What are you doing? [wind howling] [man coughing] [wind continues howling] What's he doing? He's trying to blow the Egyptians away. [laughing] Look. Look! Look. Everyone, look! Oh! Oh, my Lord! [all exclaim] [thunder cracking] (man) We are delivered! All hail the power of the Lord! [all exclaim] He has turned his face towards us. [people shouting] [horses neighing] Forward! [snorting] Death to any man who disobeys! Forward! [soldiers shouting] [lightning cracking] [neighing] [horses neigh] Forward! [all shouting] [soldiers shouting] [people clamoring] [soldiers screaming] [waves crashing] He has triumphed! The Lord is my strength and my might. This is my God, And I will praise him. Who is like the Lord? Who among the mighty? In your steadfast love, You led the people whom you redeemed! You guided them with your strength. The Lord will reign! Yes. Forever and ever! Forever and ever! (all) Forever and ever! Forever and ever! [laughing] Forever and ever! Forever and ever! Look at Moses up there. Nothing stops him. (Zerack) Speak up, Eliav! My stomach's growling so loudly I cannot hear you. Listen to you bleating like a lamb waiting at the slaughter. Slaughter there will be if we don't eat soon. Well, did the Lord fill any of your empty stomachs today? Huh? Moses, Did God lead us into the desert to starve? If it is God's will, so be it. Do you have a plan, Moses, or not? I demand to know. To follow God's will, as always. For us to starve in this godforsaken place? Godforsaken? God has shown you the way. You can call it godforsaken. Your people are starving, Moses! What are you going to do about it? Did you follow this man into the desert to starve? Truly, Moses is a great man. But somewhere he has lost contact with God's will. We must help him now! Look! Fire! [people screaming] [people clamoring] Hurry! Run! Run! (man #1) Moses, help us! (man #2) Moses, please! Moses! (woman) Moses, stop the fire! Ah, enough! (man #1) Moses, you have the power! [people continue clamoring] Stop the fire! Praying won't help. Come. Throw sand on the fire. He can't help you now. Praying won't help. Do something! Help! Throw sand on the fire! He can't help you. (Zerack) Eliav! Eliav! Moses, please! Moses! Stop the fire, Moses! (man) Moses, stop the fire! Moses! Why do you lay the burden of all the people on me? Did I conceive these people? Did I give birth to them? I cannot carry all these people alone! They're too heavy for me. [people continue clamoring] The people are waiting, Moses. For what? For God to feed them. God didn't lead us here to die, Moses. Go into your tents. Don't come out until the morning. God himself will provide bread. (Korah) Bread? How? Not a stalk of grain within a month's journey. Go into your tents. Don't come out until morning. [children shouting] [children laughing] Aaron! [laughs] What is it? Eat it. Delicious. Delicious! Like coriander seed. [laughing] Sisters, gather it up. Gather it up. Men, get some baskets and help to gather it up. It's a gift from God. We will call it, "manna." Manna. The bread that the Lord has given you to eat. Every morning you will gather as much as needed for a single day. You will receive this as a gift. Take no more than is needed for a single day because each day the lord will see to your needs. If you lack faith in the lord and take more, it will rot. It will rot. [all laughing] [people chattering] It's good. Now that you're free men, You may rest every 7th day. This will be the sabbath, and you will not have to work. The sabbath? No work? What's the sabbath? No work on the sabbath. How can we? You rest. What does it mean? God says to me, "There is no work "on the sabbath, "you will rest, you will not gather "the manna on that day, "but on the 6th day, you will take a double ration, which will not rot." No work, rest. - Sabbath. - No work. Remember this the next time you grow impatient with god, Zerack. Do you expect us to live on bread alone? This day the Lord will send you meat. [laughs] Meat? We haven't seen meat since we left Egypt. The Lord will send you meat. And you will eat it till it comes out of your nostrils. [all chuckling] Meat. [all cheering] [laughing] [all laughing] [drums beating] [people singing] [donkey braying] Jethro. Jethro! [Jethro laughing] I've heard of all your god has done for you, Moses. I had to come. See for myself. God has been good to us. How's Zipporah? She's well. I miss her. She understands, Moses. She understands. [laughing] (man) You are a liar! [people shouting] (Aaron) This has gone on 10 days, it's too long. You must honor the bond. Benjamin, [goat bleating] Know in your heart that just as a parent disciplines a child, So the Lord your God must discipline you. (Miriam) That's all for today, Moses must rest. Tomorrow, tomorrow Moses will hear your cases. He must rest now. The sun's almost gone. Why do you sit alone in judgment all day? I make known to them the statutes and instructions of God as you've seen. What I've seen is the people feeding off you, and you allowing it to happen. And you've allowed it to happen. Do you not love your brother? You have no right to ask such a question. (Jethro) And you, none of you, have any right to let Moses be destroyed by his own people. Look at him. He can hardly stand. Is this how your god rewards his servants? Jethro! Your tongue's too sharp. Jethro. But you speak the truth. This task is too heavy for a single man, Moses. Your god did not mean for you to be his only voice. Aaron was called also by God. Listen to me, and I will give you counsel for a change. You must look for men who fear your god and set these men as officers over the people. Let them settle the small matters, bring you only the important ones. Now if you do this, you will be able to endure, and these people will go home in peace. I wonder why it is so hard to listen to someone speak the truth? Do I speak the truth? How many times do you want me to say it? You're a hard teacher, Jethro. [chuckles] Yes, you speak the truth. These people, uh, are still learning to live without the law of their slave masters. God will reveal his law to us. But will you be ready? You can ask that? We travel the world, in us trusting in God's plan every day. Have you traded an Egyptian slave owner for a taskmaster in the heavens? Profanity. Laws are not sufficient by themselves, and the people must learn how to follow the law without Moses or any leader. They must learn to want to follow the law without fear of any whip on their backs, on their souls. To follow the law, because they are free not to. When they have learned that, they will truly be free. Until then, they are still slaves. This is my dream, Jethro. To no longer be needed. You're a wise man, Moses. I'll begin by choosing God-fearing men tomorrow. Umm, tonight. I'll begin by choosing Aaron. Thank you for your counsel. [people chattering] [goats bleating] Where will you go now, Moses? I believe God is leading us to Mount Sinai. I wish you pure water and green grass. As God wishes. (Moses) Mount Sinai. Where God first spoke to me. (Miriam) In the burning bush. (Moses) God is calling me up there. Do you think I'll make it, Joshua? If God is calling you, Moses. I wish he'd given me a better pair of sandals first. [Aaron laughing] Moses. Moses! Moses is coming! (man) Moses! (all) Moses. Moses. [people chattering] Hear now, oh, Israel. Hear the words of the Lord. Hear His word. God says to you: "You've seen what I did to the Egyptians! "I carried you on eagles' wings "and brought you to me. "If you will be faithful to Me and heed my covenant, "you shall be My treasured possession "amongst all peoples.” God says to you, "All the earth is Mine. "But you shall be to me a kingdom of priests "and a holy nation, if you'll obey My law "and heed my covenant,” God says to you. All the words which the Lord hath spoken we will obey. (all) We will obey! Gladly! Did the Lord appear to you, Moses? You wish to hear his voice yourselves? The people need to know that the word is truly His and not yours. You doubt me, Zerack? If you would hear the words of the Lord yourselves, then you must be prepared and consecrated. Water over here. [people chattering] (Moses) The Lord has said to me: "Have the people wash their clothes. "For 3 days, they will not lie with their wives. "Prepare for the 3rd day "when I will come upon Mount Sinai "in the sight of the people.” Purify your hearts, not only your robes, for you will be in the presence of God. (Moses) My task is almost complete, Aaron. After today, God will no longer need a mediator. He'll speak directly to the people. No, the people will always need a leader, Moses. No, Aaron, I'm not a leader. I'm an ordinary man who happened to be chosen, but now that we're out of Egypt, through God's will and power, my task is complete. You stand assembled today before the Lord your God to enter into a covenant which He is making with you in order that He may establish you as His people and that He may be your God. If you obey the commandments that God will give you today, then you will live and become numerous and the Lord will bless you in the land He has promised to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. [trumpet blowing] [people shouting] [trumpeting gets louder] [trumpeting stops] God of Abraham, We wait upon you. Speak to us! [trumpet blowing] [people shouting] [thunder cracking] [wind howling] [people continue screaming] [thunder continues cracking] Moses! Moses, do not let God speak to us! [people continue screaming] Moses! Moses! Do not let God speak to us! (Moses) Do not be afraid. We will surely die, Moses! Do not be afraid, it is your God! You speak to us, we will listen! [trumpet blowing] No! I am but a man! If I can hear him, so can you! Do not be afraid! Listen, listen to his voice! You must hear him for us! Moses! Please! We will surely die! Yes. Israel! Hear the word of the Lord. The Lord has spoken and said: "I am the Lord your God who brought you "out of bondage! "You will have no other gods besides Me! (Moses and Aaron) "You will make no graven image "nor bow down, nor worship any idol. "You shall not swear falsely in the name of the Lord. (both) "Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy!" Remember the sabbath. (all three) "Honor your father and your mother "that you may stay long in the land "the Lord your God will assign you. "You shall not murder! "You shall not commit adultery! (all) "You shall not steal! "You shall not bear false witness "against your neighbor! "You shall not covet your neighbor's house! Nor his wife, nor anything that is your neighbor's!" [wind stops blowing] The Lord has spoken! He has pronounced His law! The law of His covenant! [laughing] Do you hear, O Israel? [Moses laughing] Do you hear, O Israel? (man) Yes, Moses! [people exclaiming] (all) Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses! Moses. I must go back on the mountain. For God wishes to give you his law. You will stay here. You will remain pure while you wait for my return. [sighing] Stay pure to receive the law. He will send down. Joshua. Joshua, come with me. Come with me. [people chattering] [people clamoring] [birds chirping] Purify your soul. Ah, there. Purify your heart. Joshua. [water splashing] [sighing] [birds chirping] [people chattering] This is madness. 30 days and nothing. He had no food when he left. [goats bleating] Thank you, Korah. Do I look so awful that my presence makes you silent? No. We were just gossiping. Oh, stop it, Korah. Tell the man the truth. After all, isn't he the brother of Moses? He's not the same as Moses himself. So surely you can speak openly to me. Moses has been gone 4 phases of the moon. 30 days on Mount Sinai. It's a long time without any food. What do you want me to do? Go up after Moses? You know that's impossible. We were told to wait and to keep pure. [laughing] Keep pure? We wash 3 times a day. But for what? Not for what, Zerack, but for who. We'll do as Moses said and wait. Easy to say, but hard to enforce, Aaron. (man) You have no faith if you think they aren't returning. [people shouting] People are nervous, restless. You must do something. Aaron. Yes. Look, we do nothing more than Moses instructed. Have you forgotten your fear at the storm? No, of course not. So we'll do as we promised and wait. For how long? [men fighting] [all chattering] Please, listen! Silence! For the love of all you hold holy, silence! 32 days since Moses went up the mountain. And no sign of him. Are we to wait here forever? Did we come up from Egypt to be abandoned in the desert? Then go back! (Zerack) Always the same threat. Are these the only choices left to us? Blind obedience to Pharaoh or even blinder obedience to an old man who's probably perished in the wilderness of Mount Sinai? He's not perished! [people arguing] Do you have a 3rd option, Zerack? Yes. - Stop relying on Moses. - Yes. We don't even know what has become of him. Let us find our own way of seeking God. Fashion our own tribute to God. We will fashion His image with our own hands so that we can see him, touch him. You heard the voice of the Lord yourself. He commanded us to have no idols. Not an idol, Aaron. A tribute! Fashioned from the best gold, the best precious metals, the best gems we possess. It can be our guide out of this wilderness! [all chattering] Aaron, don't listen to them. God has been our savior so far. And He will remain with us if we're true to His word. Yes. How long before you admit that Moses has died, That he perished on Mount Sinai? Moses is not dead! Only your faith in God is dead! (Zerack) Hold your tongue, woman! The people need something to look to for inspiration now. (all) Yes, Aaron. But a graven image... No, a symbol! A guide to show the way. How long must we wait? 7 days. Great, Aaron. Why? Why 7 days? Give him 7 days. By then, Moses will return. I'm sure of it. Tsk, tsk, tsk. [all chattering] Aaron. [birds chirping] Aaron, do you have any doubt of Moses' return? Are you ready to abandon the Lord's word this easily? I said 7 days, Miriam, and 7 days it's been. (Zerack) Aaron! (Aaron) They'll do what they want. You know that. Aaron. We have discussed this amongst ourselves. We have waited the 7 days. It's time for us to take matters into our own hands. On your head be it, Zerack. He's seen the truth! Gather up all your gold and gems. Your earrings, your bracelets! Bring down the smiths and the metal workers to me! [people cheering] Blessed be this symbol of the great force that led us out of Egypt. We consecrate your image, and ask that you be with us now. Greet the birth of this image of the almighty! Celebrate its presence in our midst! Celebrate! [all cheering] [drums beating] [all singing] [pipes blowing] [drums beating] [people cheering] [all singing] [Moses shouting] [shouting] [Moses groaning] Is this how you serve God in my absence? I'm... I'm not like you, brother. [sighing] I am a weak man. We thought you were dead, Moses. What else were we to think? The word of the Lord. The hand of God. A path to lead you out of the wilderness of your own hearts. No, Moses! [all shouting] No! If that was the word of God, Moses, It was easily shattered. Can't you see? Moses can't lead us out of here. Let the calf go ahead of us, And let other tribes see our wealth and power. You have broken God's covenant. It lies on the ground before you. Those of you who would still choose to be with God, Come stand by my side now. My brothers! Fellow Levites! Have you come this far to turn your back on the Lord? Come stand with us. Stand with your tribesmen now. Are you fools? Do you wish to die in the desert? Stand with me, And we will take our own freedom. Those of you who would be with God, stand with me. Those of you who would be delivered from the wilderness, stand with me! We'll break camp in the morning. The calf will lead us. [thunder rumbling] You're a fool, Moses. We'll go our own way. There's nothing you can do about it. [thunder rumbling] Lay them waste! Moses. Thus sayeth the Lord: "Whomsoever has sinned against me, "I will blot out of my book." [thunder continues rumbling] Do God's work. Purify Israel. Moses. (Miria) No! [grunting] [all screaming] [men shouting] [grunts] [shrieking] [grunting] [screaming] [women screaming] [screaming] You will grind the idol into dust! You will put it in the water! You will drink your evil ways! And taste its bitterness! (Miriam) Where are you going? To seek God's forgiveness. Maybe I can make atonement for your sins. [goats bleating] [wind blowing] Moses! It's Moses! (Aaron) Moses! Oh, God. See the blood of the covenant the Lord has made with you. Look upon your work, Israel. This will be your sanctuary. The place for meeting God. The Lord bless you and keep you. (Aaron) The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace. [goats bleating] 10 days since we left Sinai and still no end to this wandering. Nothing to eat but this daily portion of manna. Shh. Do you remember the feast days in Egypt when we ate fish till we burst? True. There was a richness of food, even vegetables. But they were only given to us at the Pharaoh's pleasure. But at least it was given to us. Is that how you wish to live, Miriam? Eating or starving at another man's whim? I travel the desert at my brother's whim. Do you think I'm so arrogant that I decide the fate of Israel? Do you think it was me who brought you out of Egypt? No, I think it was all of us. Has the Lord spoken only through you, Moses? Miriam... Didn't god call you to the wilderness to meet Moses? It was you who gave the Lord a voice in front of the Pharaoh. Has God spoken only through Moses? No. Miriam, how can you say such a thing? You know that Moses is a humble man, he seeks no glory. You stay out of this. Miriam. All this wandering is so aimless. Surely God knows the route to the land he's promised us. Yes, and when he sees we're ready he'll deliver us there. - And you think we're not ready? - Well, do you? If God brought us to Canaan tomorrow, would we know what to do? Would we be able to see his law being followed? Could we organize ourselves? A kingdom of priests and a holy nation. We have wealth in our children, And a desire to settle on our own land. What more do we need? Brotherhood. And a willingness to serve more than our own stomachs. [Miriam screaming] Miriam, what's the matter? Miriam? Miriam! Miriam! [continues screaming] Hold on still, Miriam. Be still. Leprosy. Oh, my lord! Do not punish her for her sins. [all praying] Do not let her be consumed, Lord. Please, heal her. God says she must be shut out of the camp for 7 days, after which time she may be brought in again. She will be healed then. Take her. Take her. God is being merciful. Unclean. Unclean. Unclean. It's Moses, Miriam. I've brought you some food. Stay away, Moses. I'm not afraid, and you have to eat. No. Please. Go away. No. Why are you doing this? You're my sister. I'm sorry you thought me so arrogant. I spoke in anger, and God has punished me. God talks to me, Miriam, just as I'm talking to you. I don't deserve His presence. Why did God choose me, why me? Don't let my sin punish both of us. God has chosen you, and I am your sister, and that's God's will. Rejoice. Rejoice. All this will soon be over. We will journey to the promised land. All of us together. [people chattering] (woman #1) It is so green and lush as far as the eye can see. (woman #2) Oh, Moses, it's beautiful. Truly, Moses, we should never have doubted you. There is the promised land. [Aaron laughing] (Korah) We should never have doubted you. You should always question me, Korah, but never the word of the Lord. As he promised us, so it shall be. When will the Lord appear to lead us forward? He won't. What? Look at our numbers. Are we expected simply to walk into Canaan and occupy it? How else will it be delivered into our hands? Surely the Lord will do it for us. We must act for ourselves, Eliav, if we are to be a free people. Joshua, select 12 men, one from each of the tribes of Israel, lead them across the plain into Canaan, look closely at everything you see, then return with your news. [people chattering] Caleb, from the tribe of Judah. Shammua. Nahbi. Shaphat. Igal. [drums beating] [tribesmen chanting] We will all die if we try to occupy this land. So, Nahbi, are you too scared to lead us to the land. God promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? I won't lead my family to certain death or enslavement. God will be with us. He will lead. Be reasonable, Joshua. We've spent 40 days here. 40 days. You saw the same things we saw. The cities are heavily fortified and the people are strong. And there are so many, Joshua. But what good will their numbers be against the strength of the god who delivered us from Egypt to destroy the Pharaoh's army? Would you risk the life of your children on it, Joshua? Where the Lord leads, there is no risk. Come. [people clamoring] Madness, Joshua, madness. You sound like a madman. Eating nothing but manna has destroyed your good sense. [all laughing] The desert sun has rotted your brain. Perhaps, but not my heart. Or my faith. My trust is in the Lord, my love is for God. Can you say the same, Nahbi? Are you so righteous that you'd risk our lives? I claim no special righteousness, only devotion to the words of God. You've spent too long yapping at Moses' heels like a faithful lap dog. (Palti) It's time you thought for yourself. He does. As do I. And we know that the land God promised us lies within our reach. Try it and the Hivites will slice your hand off. They are mighty people. [all agreeing] (all) Yeah! And if the Lord is with us, He will bring us there. Like lambs to slaughter. (all) Yeah! How can you doubt God? Look how far He's brought us. Yes, look how far. Through a desert to a wilderness. We've seen brother kill brother because of the golden calf. Every step of the way he has tested us over and over. Perhaps this is yet another trial, one that only few will survive. (all) Yes. Korah speaks the truth. This so-called promised land is already home to Hittites, Jebusites. What good is a land of milk and honey if only a handful live to enjoy it? Moses, is this another test? How can I know that? All I can tell you is what the Lord commanded. We go forward into the land He promised our forefathers. I follow His word without question. Then perhaps it is time for a new leader. One who cares enough about the safety of Israel to know God's answers to these questions. - A new leader? - Yes. It is not too late to save ourselves. Better to go back to Egypt than to die here or on an Amalekite sword. [all agreeing] Far better. At least there we knew what each day would bring. A new leader. We've gone far enough with Moses and Aaron. The only place they have brought us to is one of hardship and suffering. [people agreeing] The hardship and suffering you brought upon yourselves. You sinned against the Lord. Sinned? Listen, O Israel. Moses always tells us it's our fault. [crowd agreeing] I stand with Korah. I say we anoint a new leader. One who will take us back to Egypt and save us from destruction. [people agreeing] (Korah) Look, they draw weapons. Is this killing of one another never to end? - How many more of us must die? - Stone them. [people clamoring] [people shouting] [ground rumbling] [women screaming] [people screaming] Oh, God. The Lord has spoken. Hear his words. 10 times we challenged Him and ignored his bidding. Yet even now, He will spare you. All of the men who have lived 20 years or more. Will die in this desert. [people shouting] [women shrieking] [people chattering] (Moses) For 40 years, one for each day that his servants scouted that land, those who spoke against him will wander and die. When the last of those who spurned God are fallen, then He will take their children into that country given by His oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Of those who spoke, only Joshua and Caleb will live to occupy that land for they alone were of a different spirit. (Joshua) All is as it should be, Aaron. (Aaron) Good. Then we have a home again. A temporary one, of course. How long before the promised land, Aaron? This drought is hurting us. Moses says only weeks away. So let us pray that our water lasts. Let me. No need, I'm not dead yet. Get about your business. But I can help. You're too clumsy. Men aren't able to do this kind of work. [women laughing] [coughs] [goats bleating] Moses, Aaron, it's Miriam, come quickly. Miriam. Speak to me. Miriam. Oh, no, Lord. Not Miriam. Miriam, my sister. Miriam, the light of my family. No. Not... not now! Not this close to home! [crying] Sleep gently, sister. And glory in God's goodness. Without water, we'll all follow her to the grave, and quickly. (Moses) No! Which... Which one of you said that? Even at my sister's burial you complain? Can't I even grieve without hearing your whining? Moses, Moses, they meant no harm, they simply... They simply worry for themselves. As if the Lord hasn't proven He'll care for their every need. We feel for your grief, Moses, but our animals will soon die of thirst, we only ask... You only! You only! You ignore all that God does for you, and you whine and you want. Where's the wonder at what you already have? Where's the wonder? (Aaron) Moses, Moses, come. We must ask for God's hand in this matter. Come, let us ask God's hand. Come. Come. Now kneel to God. [coughing] Dear Lord, The people need water. You satisfied now? What do you mean? God did not speak to me. He spoke to me. Moses! Go on out of my way. I command you to yield water to the people. Yield! [people murmuring] Yield! [screaming] [land rumbling] There, I've given you water. [people chattering] I heard your call, Lord. [sighs] I'm here. Yes. I did. I lacked faith. [sighing] I should have waited upon you, Lord. It was my anger, Lord, My arrogance. [chuckling] Hmm. [Aaron groaning] Moses. [breathing heavily] Miriam? You forget, brother, Miriam has passed on. Ah, yes. Yes. Has... Has the time come for me to join our beloved sister Miriam? That hour is known only to God. [continues breathing heavily] But Canaan is within grasp. Yes. We saw and lived miracles. Did we not, my brother? The calf. Moses, the calf. Will God remit my sins? Surely. He already has. [sniffling] Moses, what can I do? How do I help you, Moses? By taking the torch from my hands, Joshua. Just as God decreed. Moses. You and I will journey to Mount Nebo tomorrow. Mount Nebo? To the top of Pisgah. But before that, you must be commissioned, Joshua. God has named you to be in authority after me. I have asked the Lord, God of the spirits of all flesh, to appoint someone over the congregation who shall go out before them and come in before them, who shall lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the Lord shall not be like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said, "Take Joshua, "for he is a man in whom dwells the spirit. "Lay hands upon him "and commission him." Be strong and bold, for you shall lead the Israelites into the land the Lord promised them. God will be with you. [Moses coughing] [coughing] [panting] Sit me down on a rock, Joshua. The land the Lord promised is just on the other side of this mountain, Joshua. Yes, Moses, and we are ready. God has said to me: "This is the land "I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying "I will give this to your descendants.” You have achieved the great task the Lord put before you. The Lord also said this to me: "Moses, "you may view the land from a distance, "but you shall not enter it." This cannot be. You are the servant of the Lord. God has said this to me. Surely if you plead with God, He will hear you. I have. No, Joshua. This is as it should be. Why? Because I was arrogant, Joshua. I struck the rock twice for God's water. I did not trust God to reveal His holiness before the eyes of the people. But, Moses... It was my anger speaking, Joshua, and God cannot turn His eyes from that. God cannot build a nation on anger, Joshua. [sighing] I'm... ...going... ...up the mountain now. Joshua, I shall not come down again. No, Moses. I'll come with you. No, no. This is as it should be. [thunder rumbling] God is calling me home, now, to be with him forever. [grunting] [thunder continues rumbling] The people must follow you now, Joshua. You are beloved of God, but... ...the land of Canaan is only promised, Joshua. Every inch will be a struggle. You must now build a new Israel based upon the love of the law, not blind obedience to it. You have the people well-organized, Joshua. Are they ready to cross Jordan? More than ready. Anxious to follow God's word. Rejoice, for I have accomplished my task. It's for you, now, to complete God's will. My job is finished. God's will be done. The promised land. [Hebrew song playing] [women wailing] [people exclaiming] Remember what Moses, the servant of God, instructed you. Beyond lies Canaan, the land promised our forefathers. Now, for the 2nd time, the Lord bids you, "Go forth!" [all roaring] (male narrator) From Jericho to Shechem the Lord led Israel into the land. He had promised their forefathers. And at Shechem, Joshua placed a stone at the foot of the sacred oak. And said: "Let this stone be a witness against us "if ever we break faith with God." And the children of Israel ended their wandering.
