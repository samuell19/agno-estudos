[somber music] [melancholy music] [tense music] - That's where he died. They say seventh cell you die. [tense music] It's cursed. - [Daphne] No, it's not. - I don't believe it, either. Why don't you go in there and see? - [Daphne] Why don't you? - Okay. I'm not scared. See, come in. [tense music] [choking] - [Daphne] Stop it, Jake. Mommy, Jake's scaring me! - [Seth] Hey, what's going on? - [Daphne] Jake's scaring me. - [Seth] What are you doing with your sister, Jake? - [Jake] Oh, I was only playing around with her, Dad. - I thought I told you guys upstairs was off-limits. Understand? All right, I want you to apologize and take her downstairs for me. - [Jake] I'm sorry, Daph. - [Daphne] Just don't scare me again. - Exactly, so we're all good here, okay? Go back downstairs. I'll be down in a minute. [clanging] [tense ominous music] [tense music] [faint pop music] - [Grace] Did you find out what was going on up there? - [Seth] Jake was trying to scare his sister. - [Grace] I thought we said the jail was off-limits. - Well, I don't know honey. I must've told 'em a dozen times. - [Grace] Can you use a glass? - What were they doing up there? - Well, they're kids, you know. Weren't you curious when you were a kid? - Yeah, but I didn't live below a jail, especially one where inmates are gonna be housed. - Come on now, Gracie. I must've apologized to you a hundred times, here. All right, it wasn't supposed to work out like this. I'm sorry. - [Grace] Seth, but you knew that it could. - Well, we've only been here for three dang weeks. Now, what are the chances? Besides, I think the Sheriff's been pretty generous lettin' us stay here free of charge, at least until our house is finished. - [Grace] Seth, look at me. I don't want myself or my kids living below inmates. - Well, what do you wanna do, sweetheart? You wanna go to your mama's? - No, why can't the town put us in a motel? - Because I told you already. There's no budget for that. - The inmates aren't even here yet and the kids are already scared. - Well, jails are scary. Don't worry, I'll keep it all locked up. We're gonna be fine. - Seth, we're gonna be living in the same place as criminals. Has that registered with you, yet? - Sweetheart, I'm with them 24 seven, okay? You're gonna be safe. - This whole idea is ludicrous to me and to think that the town can't accommodate us is absurd. - [Seth] Grace. It's one of the stipulations I agreed upon as Sheriff, all right? I'll take care of this. - [Grace] Why here? - Because sweetheart, the prison is overcrowded. [knocking] [faint rock music] [knocking] - [Grace] Sheriff. - [Sheriff] 'Morning, Grace. Seth. - [Seth] Hey, Sheriff. - [Sheriff] You guys doin' okay? - Well, how long exactly do you plan on housing these inmates here for? - Should be a temporary thing. - [Grace] How temporary? - A month, max. Just long enough for us to get the jail up and running. You got my word on that. - [Seth] You see, sweetheart. Four weeks. What's the worst that can happen?

[tense eerie music] [mumbling] [coughing] All right gentlemen and lady. [mumbling] - [Pablo] Hey man, all I did was write a few bad checks. I didn't get the, I didn't get the death penalty. - [Clayton] That's enough, Pablo. - Plus, this place stinks. Smells like my wife. - [Cash] I guess you and your wife share just about everything, huh? [tense eerie music] Sheriff, I'd like to have a restraining order placed on that old, dirty bastard. Please keep him away from me. - [Sheriff] He'll be in a separate locked cell, Cash. - [Stark] Sheriff, is Waylen stayin' with us? I mean, no offense, buddy, but you're an accused murderer. - [Waylen] Oh no, no, I completely understand. I'm a dangerous guy. - [Sheriff] Down the hall in a separate locked cell, away from you, Stark. - See? We're good, thank you. - Relax. You got a deputy downstairs 24 seven. [clanking] - [Cash] Sheriff look, I hate to belabor this point, but I have a serious aversion to asbestos. - [Sheriff] It's not as bad in here as you think, Cash. - [Stark] I mean, if I could just make my phone call, I'd be out of your hair, Sheriff. - [Sheriff] I'll work on that right away for ya. - [Stark] Thanks, Sheriff. - [Pablo] Sheriff, this is a little harsh, don't you think, for a couple of bounced checks? - [Sheriff] Come on, Pablo, a couple? - [Cash] Sheriff. - You got a deputy downstairs. - [Cash] I hate to reiterate the point, but I mean, this place is-- - [Pablo] Shithole! - Yeah, a 12th century shithole. I mean, this is definitely below health code standards. - [Daphne] Mommy, I'm scared. - [Grace] It's okay, honey. Everything's gonna be okay. - [Seth] Listen to your mama, littles. We're gonna be fine. - [Jake] Why are they here? - Well, Jake, you know, when we moved into Colton our house wasn't ready yet, so, the Sheriff was nice enough to let us stay here, at least until it's finished. The fire at the jailhouse, there's just no other place to put the inmates. - [Daphne] Daddy, I don't want the bad people upstairs. - I know you don't, kitten, but I promise we're gonna be all right. - [Jake] How do you know, Dad? - Because I'm gonna make sure, that's how I know. - I wanna go to Mawmaw's. - [Grace] We'll figure something out, okay? - A hotel? - Would everybody just stay calm, please? We're gonna be fine. - Listen to your daddy, kids. He's right. Everything's gonna be okay. Seth, could I see ya? - [Seth] I'll be right back. - [Daphne] I wanna go to Mawmaw's. - [Sheriff] All right, Deputy Clayton's gonna have the day shifts. You'll have the nights. - [Seth] That's fine with me. I'd just as soon be working while my family's asleep. - [Sheriff] Good. - [Calvin] Seth, can I have a word with you? - 'Scuse me, Sheriff. How's it goin', Calvin? - Hey, listen. Little news. We're running a little behind schedule on the renovations of your new home. - [Seth] Listen, I don't know if you've heard, but we're-- - [Calvin] I know. I know, I read the paper this morning. Look, we're doing everything we can. We're working at breakneck speed to get you in before the holidays. - [Seth] I appreciate that. Look, just do whatever it takes to speed things up, please. - Man, we're trying. - [Seth] All right, thank you. - Right. - [Sheriff] What's up, uh, you must really want outta here. - Can you blame me? I mean, my wife's not too thrilled about this situation. - [Sheriff] I told you before that no one downstairs is gonna be bothered. The jail is soundproofed. I'll be back in the morning to check on the inmates. - [Seth] Yes, sir. - [Clayton] Soundproof. [tense eerie music] [scratching] - [Stark] What are you lookin' at, Pablo? - [Pablo] The stars, Stark. Stars. - [Stark] Still awake? - [Maddy] Like I could sleep in this shithole. - [Stark] I know. Kinda creepy, huh? - Kinda. I'm scared outta my mind. - What did you do? - Writing bad checks like your boy over there. [Pablo ululating] - [Stark] He's a character. [popping] [ululating] So, what'd you do? - [Maddy] I got caught up in this drug thing. - [Stark] Drug thing? - Yeah, boyfriend, long story. What about you? - DUI. - A DUI and you're stuck in this place? - Yeah, time has never been on my side. I had some trouble before and they set bail too high. You know how that goes. - [Maddy] Sorry. - That's all right. I'll be out by tomorrow. - Good luck. Enjoy this place while you can. - Yeah. - At least you're not the only female. - [Stark] It's kinda weird you're in here with us. - What do you expect from a small town like Colton? - [Donnie] Colton's not so bad. This jail. Worst part about this place is this big old piece of steel between me and a beautiful lady. - [Maddy] Hey, nobody's talking to you. - [Stark] Don't worry about him. - [Maddy] Creep. - I heard that. - [Maddy] Good. - [Stark] Hey, it's gonna be all right. - All right, I'm tired. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - [Donnie] Goodnight. [tense music] - [Stark] Shoulda left a long time ago. [tense eerie music] That was amazing. [mumbling] - [Jilian] I'm driving. - [Stark] I mean, seriously, that was a great night. I mean, you won like, nine straight games of pool. [mumbling] You're shocking and I'm starving. - [Jilian] No, you're drunk is what you are. [tense music] [birds chirping] - Wow. Look at you. Look at you. You're more beautiful than ever, baby. More beautiful than ever. I really missed you, you know. So much, and I understand if you don't wanna talk to me anymore. I understand that, and, I understand if you're mad at me. I just miss you so much. [weeping] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I love you. - [Clayton] Waylen. - [Waylen] What are you lookin' at? What the fuck are you lookin' at? [screaming] [thudding] - [Clayton] Crazy bastard. [Pablo ululating] - Up and at 'em, people. It's breakfast. Stay away from the door 'til I call your name. Stark. Cash. Pablo. Maddy. Donnie. - [Dispatcher] 10-54 in progress at 913 Pine Grove Drive. We need all available units to come immediately. - [Clayton] 10-4, this is unit two. I'm on the way. [clanging] - [Cash] Pablo. - [Pablo] Well, don't mind if I do. Yeah, uh huh. - [Clayton] I gotta go on a 10-54. - [Seth] Wait a second, what is it? - [Clayton] I don't know, but the Sheriff said you had to cover for me. - [Seth] What do you mean-- - [Clayton] I'll see ya later. [siren blaring] - [Maddy] Seat taken? - [Stark] Who'd they let out of the cage? - [Maddy] I know, right? - [Stark] How'd you sleep? - Aw, my neck and back are killing me. Probably got like, three hours. 'Bout you? - [Stark] How could anyone sleep in this place? Pablo was right. This place smells of death and bad dreams. - [Maddy] What, you dreamed of something worse than this place? - Am I awake? Please tell me I'm dreaming. - You need me to pinch you? - Might have to. It's all right. I'm gettin' out today. - Oh, yeah, you'd leave me in here with these animals, huh? - I can make a call once I get to the outside if you want. [tense music] [tense music] - [Seth] What in the hell? [tense beat music] [frantic mumbling] [thudding] [yelling] - [Waylen] Need your help. Down here, we need your help! [garbled moaning] [reel flickering] [tense beat music] [frantic mumbling] - Break it up. [yelling] Break it up. [thudding] [grunting] [reel flickering] [garbled roaring] [grunting] Break it up. [thudding] Break it the fuck up! The next one that throws a Goddamn punch, gets the pipe upside his fucking head. Am I clear? Now, settle your asses down, or I'll be back. [breathing heavily] [horn blaring] [slamming] [metal pipe banging] [cricket chirping] [tense eerie music] - [Grace] Seth. Seth! Seth, what are you doing? [tense eerie music] - [Seth] Did you put the kids in bed? - [Grace] Yeah. Seth! [tense music] [thudding] [grunting] [groaning] [tense beat music] [yelling] [frantic mumbling] - Hit the man, Mick. - [Man] Get him, get him. - [Man] Hit the nigger! [thudding] Hit him, hit him! [thudding] [tense ominous music] [thudding] [grunting] - [Grace] You passed out. What's wrong? I mean, I've known you forever and I've never seen you pass out. - [Seth] God, I must have ate something bad. - I'm gonna take you to the hospital. - [Seth] No, no, no hospitals. I'm gonna be fine. - I don't deserve to be here behind these kind of bars. I deserve to be in a better bar where I can have a drink. But they uh, all I did was write a couple of bad checks. My wife comes home one day with two sealpoint Siamese cats. They were twins. And she wanted me to go out and get this special diet. And all I had was rent money, but she said she was gonna leave me if I didn't feed these cats. - [Cash] Pablo, what are you doing? - [Pablo] I don't know what I'm doing. - [Cash] I guess everybody's a little nuts. - Or they're nuts. [chuckling] - Yeah, that'd be great. That sounds like a lot of fun, too. Maybe, maybe all three of us could go, huh? Little walk down the beach. Maybe a glass of wine or two after. Who knows what'll happen, right? [chuckling] Oh really, Renee? What now, huh? What now, Renee? Well, of course you're jealous. Now you know how I felt when you were lookin' at him. You watch your goddamn mouth. Watch your goddamn mouth. Can I help you? [tense music] [muffled grunting] - [Donnie] Shh. - [Stark] Mother fucker. Son of a bitch. Get off her. [thudding] [grunting] - [Waylen] Jesus. Fuckin' get back. [excited chattering] - [Stark] Give him his fuckin' asshole. [mumbling] [clanging] - [Maddy] Fucking [mumbling]. - [Stark] Sorry. [grunting] - [Donnie] Why don't we all just get a piece of that? - [Stark] Sick fuck. - [Donnie] Just 'cause your mama's not here. [laughing] [mumbling] - It's locked, right? - [Maddy] Yeah, fuckin', fuck. Just make sure that fuckin' shit's locked. - [Stark] It's locked. I'm sorry. [chuckling] - [Donnie] Whoo! [faint pop music] - [Grace] May I help you? - [Clayton] Mornin' ma'am. - [Grace] Morning. - [Clayton] Ah, I'm just here to feed the new tenants. - [Grace] Funny. - I was just tryin' to make ya laugh. - [Grace] Well, don't. - [Clayton] 10 four. [faint pop music] [knocking] Waylen, I got you some breakfast. What the fuck is this? Sick dude. [tense music] - [Donnie] Hey, hey up here. Mornin' pumpkin. Hey, we got some unfinished business, don't we? Hey. [smooching] Why don't you give me some more of that? [chuckling] Oh, don't be mad. Come on. [footsteps shuffling] - [Cash] Pablo, we don't both have to work out at the same time. - [Pablo] Just living my life, just living my life. [mumbling] [footsteps shuffling] - [Cash] Hey, Pab, do you remember that spacial awareness thing I was talkin' to you about? - [Pablo] Yes, I do. Feng shui thing, yeah. - [Cash] What's goin' on with you, Albert? I thought you were gettin' out today. - [Stark] Yeah, I thought I made bail. - [Cash] Yeah, well, hopefully we'll all be outta here soon. - Hopefully. What are you in for? - It's a long story. - How long could it be? - [Clayton] Rise and shine my people. - Deputy, you can't let Donnie out of his cell. - [Clayton] Excuse me? - [Stark] You can't let him out of his cell. - [Donnie] Don't listen to that prick, Deputy. Lemme out. - [Clayton] Why, did something happen? - [Maddy] He tried to rape me. - [Clayton] What? When? - [Maddy] Last night. [banging] - [Donnie] It's his shit! - [Stark] Deputy, you can't let him out. [faint country music] - [Seth] Hey, sweetheart. Where are the kids? - [Grace] Kids are at school. It's noon. They been there for hours. You'd know that if you didn't sleep so much. - [Seth] I'm sorry. These inmates got me runnin' ragged. I don't even know which way's up. Shoulda just woke me up earlier. - [Grace] I tried and you didn't move. What's this? [clanking] - [Donnie] This ain't right. I ain't no animal. - [Clayton] I guess you are for now. - [Maddy] Get him away from there! - [Clayton] So sorry this happened, but just hang tight and I'm gonna take care of this, all right? I promise. - [Stark] Deputy. I thought I made bail. - [Clayton] Well, you're still in here, ain't ya? - [Stark] I guess I gotta call my lawyer, right? - [Clayton] I guess you do. - [Stark] Can you make that happen for me? - [Clayton] Yeah, I'll get right on that. - Thanks Deputy. [groaning] - [Cash] No, Pablo, come on man. - [Pablo] You gotta go, you gotta go. [grunting] - [Cash] You couldn't wait five minutes? - [Pable] Five minutes? Take a dump like this? That's like, five years, dude. What are you talking about? [stammering] - [Cash] Why do you smell like that? We're all eating the same food. Smell like Dr. Frankenstein. - [Pablo] What do you want me to smell like? - Shouldn't exercise as much. You're waking up with a monster in your belly's what you're doing. [clunking] - Yeah. [grunting] - [Seth] Something I found upstairs. Been looking for that. - [Grace] What? [faint mellow music] What's wrong with you? - No, Sheriff, I don't know what happened. Yeah, Donnie and Maddy's cells were left open. Well no, but he tried to rape her. She's okay, but they don't want me to let Donnie out of his cell. Yeah, I'll say something to Seth about it. Will do.

I don't wanna bore you with the details. - [Maddy] Well, I got nothin' but time. And I'm all ears. - My dad left was I was young and my mom basically drank herself to death out of guilt from killin' my sister, car accident.

My mom died a year after. What about you? I mean, where's your family? - [Maddy] Oh, man, I don't know. - [Stark] Why is that? - I don't know. I just don't. We had a falling out, I guess. My boyfriend, who was the one growing the drugs in the first place doesn't seem to be making it a big priority to come bail me out. - [Stark] Wait, he didn't get locked up? - No, should of, but he didn't. - Wow, your luck is as good as mine.

Hey. - [Calvin] Good evening, Seth. - [Seth] Calvin. - [Calvin] Thought I'd stop by and give you an update on the progress of your new home. - [Seth] Last time we spoke Calvin, you said you were workin' at breakneck speed on that son of a bitch. - [Calvin] We are. - Well, you just keep that up. - [Calvin] Well, Seth, Seth. I mean, it's only been a couple of days. - Yeah, if I was you, I'd get your little ass in that fancy little car of yours and get off my property, pronto. - [Calvin] You know, it's only been a couple of days, and-- it's not your property. - All right boys, here you go. - [Stark] Something's not right. - [Maddy] You think? - [Stark] Where's that guy Donnie? - I don't know, I don't care. - [Stark] That's understandable. But he hasn't been around in the last couple of days. Then old man Pablo, him makin' bail? I mean, come on. That doesn't make sense. - [Maddy] He does nothing but work out. - [Stark] I know. - [Maddy] [mumbling] fight with Donnie. [clanking] - [Seth] Who's thirsty? Brought y'all some refreshments. - [Cash] What is this? Red punch? I don't drink this stuff. - Oh, I'm sorry. That's my bad. You got a problem with your drink? - [Stark] Ah. - [Seth] You see, that wasn't so tough was it? Dumbass. [clanking] Y'all need anything else, you just holler. [laughing] [tense eerie music] - [Stark] So, you're an accountant? Wow. - Numbers, you know, they're like people. They all have their own little world, Their positive and negative sides. Full of possibility. Indivisibles, their variables, squares. Roots. Freedom isn't where you live. It's not your job. Hey, hey, hey, you all right? Woo, woo, not lookin' too good, buddy. - [Stark] Hell if I-- - Are you sure? Woo, woo, woo.

Stark, is that you? - [Stark] Yeah. Why are you whispering? - [Maddy] I don't know. Trying not to wake anyone up. - I don't think no one else is here. Hey, is your head hurting? - Yeah, I feel like I got hammered last night. What do you mean nobody else is here? Where's Cash? - I don't know. I guess he made bail, too. Hey, do you smell that? [screeching] - [Maddy] Yeah, I smell it. - Because the deputy downstairs, I think he put something in our drinks last night. - [Maddy] I think so, too. - Yeah, I mean come on, red punch for Cash? - You're so smart, you should be a detective. - Funny. How's your cage? - It's fantastic. - [Stark] I like what you've done with the place. - [Maddy] Yeah, just call me Martha Stewart. - [Stark] It's gonna be all right. [clanking] - [Seth] Sorry to break up this little jailhouse romance, but I got plans for your ass. - [Maddy] More painting? - Not quite, but just as exciting. Let's go. Not so fast, turbo. - [Stark] You said let's go. - I was talking to the lady. - [Stark] What's that? - That's your new best friend. The two of you gonna shine up them toilets. And I do mean shine.

That old jail. [tense eerie music] - [Jilian] Is it haunted? - How'd you know? Just ruined my story. This deputy treated these inmates really, really bad. Inmates rose up and killed him. So they shut the place down, or something like that. - [Jilian] Just trying to scare me? - No, no, no. Every Halloween, my friends and I would dare each other to go into that place. We were always too scared. - [Jilian] It's probably a good thing. - How 'bout one last adventure before we leave Colton, babe? - [Jilian] No. - Come on, don't be scared. - Don't be stupid. - What do we have to be afraid of, huh? We have each other, right? - [Jilian] We could get in trouble. - No one ever goes in there. Come on. Let's go. [chuckling] [tense somber music] [whimpering] [mumbling] Oh my God. I'm gonna get some help, I'm gonna get some help. [whimpering] Oh God, fuck. Babe? Oh fuck. Hey! Hey I'm up here! Hey! [tense somber music] [whimpering] Okay, I'm gonna get help, get help.
