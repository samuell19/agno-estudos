So, there were efforts afoot to try and change the cigarette because that was what was igniting most of the fires. FEMALE VOICE ON TV: In the last 10 years, significant steps have been made toward developing a federal fire-safe cigarette safety standard. CALLAHAN: Up to that point, the industry response had been, "We just can't do it. "We can't make a cigarette that anyone's gonna want to "smoke that will extinguish on its own. It's just not feasible." They had a very successful, very lucrative product. And they were very leery of changing it. ...where we're taking on the major cause of fire death, the major cause of fire injury... McGUIRE: I was there. I testified. The cigarette industry said, "It's not our problem. You should make furniture cigarette-resistant." They said that in hearings. The homes of America are filled with furniture that had not been treated to reduce its flammability. In fact, I can report that we have developed a method for applying a flame and smolder retardant in the home. McGUIRE: They had a flame retardant that you could go and spray everything in your environment with this flame retardant to prevent cigarettes from igniting it. Fire retardants can save you thousands of dollars and possibly save your life. McGUIRE: That was their solution in 1983... The tobacco industry's solution... To fires caused by cigarettes. All right, so, page 23. I started kind of noodling around on the tobacco document sites, where there's this phenomenal repository of documents that the tobacco industry turned over to settle lawsuits. There's 13 million of them online. It's just an investigative reporter's dream. This issue of making a fire-safe cigarette was gaining some traction, and they were worried about it. They said, "Neither industry response has been "particularly effective in offsetting fire scarred "victims interviewed by the news media and paraded before legislative committees." "Fire scarred victims." That's what they feared. We are not here as freaks parading before you for sympathy, but as burn victims who could have been any one of you but for the grace of God.

On some of the early versions of the standard that I wrote, I specifically indicated that if any flame retardant chemicals of any type had to be added to products in order to achieve compliance with the standard, that there should not be any negative effect in terms of adverse health impacts. That was removed from the standard. ♪ McGUIRE: So, it was a solution from 1975 in California, and it went totally below the radar screen. No one knew this happened. The only people who knew that it had happened was the furniture industry. And they ultimately went along with it because it was just California. But eventually, after the years went by from 1975 on, they had to do it for the rest of the country. They had to do it for Canada. Because it was too difficult to make furniture for California with poison in the foam, and then storehouse furniture for other states and countries with no poison in the foam. So they just said, "Let's just put poison in all the foam." McGUIRE: Because the California market is so huge, it's in all your furniture throughout the country. WOMAN: It's called Technical Bulletin 117, TB117. And if you go home and look at your couches, you will probably find TB117 labels on your couches. And it's not a very good standard.

And when fabric burns, do you still have a teeny flame? You have a big flame. And then the furniture... The foam burns in maybe 2 or 3 seconds.

So, what would you do? How many of you would go to Mount Everest? How many of you would stay and write the paper about the kids' pajamas? Well, I did both. [Laughter] So the chemical is called brominated Tris. And this was in the mid-seventies. And we found a little girl who had never worn Tris-treated pajamas. So we put her in the pajamas, and we collected her urine. And the next day, there were Tris breakdown products in her urine. Does that sound good? AUDIENCE: No. BLUM: And they were cancer- causing chemicals that we were finding in this little girl's urine. ♪ BLUM: I flew my Tris flag at about 24,000 feet and sent my paper by mail runner back to Berkeley to be published. It's unusual. But it worked. 3 months after we wrote the paper, Tris was removed from kids' pajamas. However, today, chlorinated Tris is the most commonly used flame retardant in our furniture and baby products. So, here we got it out of kids' pajamas in the seventies, but it's back today in our furniture, our baby products. ♪ So now I can understand how they wouldn't want to speak at the hearing because there will be hooting and hollering.

So, this is the kind of thing that my daughter Gigi is sleeping on today at preschool. So, she sleeps on this and it's soft, and the reason it's soft is it's got polyurethane foam in it. Here, it's cut out because we had to test the polyurethane foam. That's how we know it has these toxic chemicals in it. Now, if you think about when you squeeze a nap mat and some of the air comes out, that air contains a vapor of a carcinogen, and it's right in the breathing space of the child that just squeezed it by putting their head down.

These chemicals come out of the foam, and they like to attach to dust particles, which then eventually come back down and either, you know, form a film on your couch, or on the floor, which is where most kids spend most of their time. They're getting more exposure because they're touching everything and then putting their hands in their mouth.

And that's the thing about organohalogens. It's not like they give you a burn or a rash. It's they go into your body, they stay. And over the course of your life, they can cause serious health problems. And the very same thing that makes them desirable to chemical companies as a flame retardant, in many cases is the very same thing that worries people who study environmental health. They can be kind of volatile. They can travel widely from where they originally, you know, start out at. And they also often can bioaccumulate, and they're toxic. It's like a trifecta of concern with flame retardant chemicals in this country today. ♪ BLUM: So, I have one little chemistry lesson. If we look at that molecule on the top, you have a polybrominated diphenyl ether. PBDEs. PBDEs. They're found in over 90% of Americans' bodies. They're found in breast milk and blood and urine, and even in amniotic fluid. And they accumulate up the food chain. And way at the top of the food chain is a nursing baby... Marine mammals and nursing babies. So, our children have 3 times the level of adults. So, these are chemicals we have about a pound in your house. Women with higher levels take twice as long to become pregnant. Children, when they have higher levels at birth, have 4 to 6 points less IQ permanently. There's a number of studies trying to relate them to autism. There are literally thousands of papers showing harm from these flame retardants. JANSSEN: Increased rates of childhood learning and behavioral problems. Increased rates of birth defects. Adulthood cancers, like testicular cancer. And there is some good evidence that flame retardants are contributing to the increased rates of cancer in our firefighters. Because the flame retardants in their chemical structure, when they're burned and when they are volatilized or vaporized into the air, they form these toxic chemicals, specifically things like dioxins and furans, which are known cancer-causing chemicals. And fires that have flame retardants actually turn out to be more toxic than fires that don't have these chemicals. STEFANI: I know when you guys took the job, and I know when I took the job, I didn't give a damn what we were coming in contact with. When we went into a building on fire, the object was to knock the fire down as fast as we could in the city, and if there was life involved, to save a life. Tom, what do you think? I think it's... I think it's important that we realize that these fires that we're going to now are just an absolute toxic soup, the environment we're entering into. It's Three Mile Island. It's... you know, it's Love Canal, and it's on fire. And those chemicals are sticking on our equipment. Those chemicals are sticking on our skin. We're seeing more and more breast cancer now in the female firefighters, and we have the highest percentage of female firefighters in the United States, if not in the world.

"is this a high number, or is this just normal? Is this what just happens in our lives?" DIFFERENT WOMAN: My first fire was on 45 Yosemite Avenue in San Francisco, off Third Street. You go up the stairs, I look right. There's nothing. It's dark. But I... there's no more heat, there's no sound. I look left. I see orange glow. It's loud. Oh, we're going that way.

Everybody helped me gather the report. They went through all the journals. And I was... I was really blown away by all the toxins we were exposed to. [Radio transmissions] KERR STONE: Alison's death was probably the biggest event in my adult life. She was my colleague. And it really hit home. It hit home about what we're exposed to and that you can get really sick... and be this vibrant, healthy, powerful person, and have all the fight in you you want, and not live. It changed my perspective on my job. It didn't change my love of the job. It changed my realization about what the job was, and how much I was exposed to. And I remember at the same time, I had learned a little while before that there were toxins in breast milk. I had talked to Tony. I asked about that and he said, "Oh, there is "research on it, and they are finding it from flame retardants." And I thought, "From flame retardants?" Here I was. I had breast-fed my first child. I thought I was giving him the healthiest thing I could possibly give him. Going back to work and still breastfeeding. And I thought, "What did I feed him?" Maybe they're going too fast. KERR STONE, VOICE-OVER: Now I feel like, well, all I can do, at least now I know that 117 exists and that I should read the label. But most people have no idea, then. They have no idea. And they think the same thing I do. They think, "I've got this nice safe car seat, this nice safe stroller, this great breast pillow." All right. What are you thankful for today? I'm really thankful for the pasta. [Chuckles] That's a good one. KERR STONE, VOICE-OVER: It seems like something's wrong with this picture. If it was banned in kids' pajamas decades ago, why is it still in so many products? Because it's a lot less likely that my child is going to catch on fire when I'm breast feeding than it is that they might get exposures to toxins. It doesn't take a scientist to figure that one out. "They'll put out the flames..." ROE, VOICE-OVER: You have sort of an untold public health threat that's in everyone's home. It's in everybody's home. You know, the industry has worked really hard to downplay that health risk and to promote this idea that flame retardants are working. But if the science shows that these chemicals don't really even work the way they're used, then why are we getting the potential risk and none of the benefit or the purported benefit? The people who make these chemicals don't really want people to ask that question. [Machinery rumbling] [Vehicle beeping] FEMALE VOICE: Flame retardants are also an important part of the fire safety toolbox. Yet they go unnoticed and in some cases are misunderstood. The major reason for the reduction of the fires is the fact that flame retardants have been incorporated into so many materials in the home. We first contacted the American Chemistry Council and asked them for, you know, proof that flame retardants work. We just wanted to know. This is very early on in our reporting. And they gave us the government study by Vito Babrauskas. One of the findings was that flame retardants would give people in maybe a residential home a 15 times fold escape time in a fire. If you had flame retardants in your home, you would have 15 times more time to escape if those things caught on fire. That's what the industry said. That's not what the study said. That's... that was completely wrong, and it was easy to prove because we went to the main author of that study and said, "Here's what they're saying your study says. Is that true?" And he said, "Absolutely not. They're distorting it." There was something very narrow and specific and specialized about that study. All of the products we tested were cost no object, state of the art materials. The items that were tested were not tested under real-world conditions. These items had NASA-style flame retardants added to it. They used the most potent, expensive flame retardants, and they put these in these experimental items. And lo and behold, it proved that flame retardants work. But that is not the furniture when we go into a retailer and say, "I want a new living room sofa." And so the industry said, "Look. "This study shows that you get 15 times fold escape time." But no, not unless your furniture is made by NASA, you won't. Now, California and TB117 is basically the opposite extreme of the scale. They put in a very small amount, on the order of 3% to 5%. And once you do that, you get the worst of both possible worlds. ♪ BABRAUSKAS: These pieces of foam are tested naked, just a piece of foam. Now I know absolutely nobody who has in his living room a piece of naked foam that they sit on. ♪ It's just plain old... This is from my house, actually. We redecorated. My wife said I could have this one. What we've got here is a piece of foam that we took out, and it was tested, and it has the penta in it, which is a pentabromo diphenyl ether. Let's see if we can make a piece that we'll cover up with a piece of fabric. LUCAS: What we've found is that when the fabric catches fire, if it catches fire, you can end up with a much bigger flame. And when you have a really large flame, we found that the materials used, even if they've been treated with fire retardants, can burn. In fact, when they do burn, they can produce smoke that can be more toxic than untreated materials. That's a pretty intense fire, a lot of smoke coming off. MAN: And that foam was... This foam passes TB117. BABRAUSKAS: You get maybe a slight benefit of a few seconds of ignition time, something like that, from a fire safety point of view, but you do get great gobs more of noxious chemicals that are put out in the smoke, and they are going to be toxic to human beings. CALLAHAN: Vito Babrauskas, he explained to me that by the time the fabric cover burns and the flames reach the foam inside that's treated with flame retardants, what he said to me was the fire just laughs at it. ROE: That was a study that was sort of easy to disprove because the author himself, after many, many years, came out and said, "No, they're distorting it, and I want them to stop." So, they manipulated your research to suit their needs? Well, in an exceedingly blatant and disgraceful way, yes. And they wouldn't stop. They just kept going. It made me think that some of these other studies that they've been using over the years, you know, might have similar problems. Then they came up with the Simonson study, saying that the study out of Sweden proved all these things. There have been several studies, particularly in Sweden. The Swedish National Research and Testing Lab SP, with Margaret Simonson and her group at SP found, is that you have orders of magnitude better environment from the point of view of toxicity, when you have materials that are... Products that are more fire safe. It's just incredible. And if you drill down on this study, you'll find that the foundation of all those broad claims are an obscure study... So obscure that it's only available in Swedish. [Woman speaking Swedish] ROE: It's a government report out of Sweden 15 years ago that has nothing to do with flame retardants. And the study is so obscure, the industry doesn't have a copy. You can't find it online. It's not published anywhere. And we had to go to the only library in the world that I could find that has a copy of it, the National Library of Sweden, to get a copy. And then we had it translated in English. And what you'll find is that all these broad claims that they've been making are based on 8 TV fires that occurred outside of Stockholm in '95 and '96. Well, that logic is so fundamentally flawed because it's such a small sample. But once they made that claim... That because of those 8 TV fires, flame retardants work... They used that finding and that logic to do other studies. So, then they could say, "Well, it reduces pollution "because there's fewer fires. "It saves society millions of dollars because flame "retardants work. It saves money." Basically, that's the main study that they highlight. I thought there would be a lot of studies that support that flame retardants work, that the industry would have more in their... they'd have more ammunition than what they had. They basically had two, and both of them... Both of their arguments were really fundamentally flawed. ♪ With a normal cover... CALLAHAN: As far as furniture goes, when we looked into it we found that government scientists and independent scientists have looked at this over and over again and have found they provide no meaningful benefit for consumers. And so it's, you know, they don't work. ♪ Now, the good news is: fire-related deaths have decreased significantly, not only in this country but throughout the western world because we have rightfully required that all new construction have sprinkler systems and smoke alarms and that cigarettes self-extinguish. So, we've changed the way we deal with fire risk already. The second thing is there are ways to mandate that the fabric meet a certain weave and thickness standard with no chemicals added that makes it resistant to fire caused by small flames or cigarettes even it helps with the cigarette problem, and all of that has nothing to do with chemicals. My view is today, you can have fire safety without the use of fire retardant chemicals. So, again, then why are we requiring that products be made with these potentially and known dangerous chemicals? STEFANI, VOICE-OVER: When I contracted cancer, I got to the point where I had run out or was close to running out of my sick time, my vacation time. I got to the point where there was going to be no money coming into my house for my family, my two sons. At that time, I was a captain. There was approximately 200 officers that were able to donate time to me. And just about every single one of those 200 that had time donated time to me so I could continue to go through my treatment, recovery, and put a paycheck on my table. I called every single one of those people up and thanked them for what they did. But... I didn't think it was enough. And then a crazy thing happened. I was involved in a pretty lousy cycling accident. I was out getting some exercise, and got hit by a pickup truck. My doctor at UCSF told me, "Tony, you're here for a reason." It was in the back of my mind, and I said, "You know, doc, you're right. "I'm going to try to put a non-profit foundation together, and work toward preventing cancer in firefighters here in the city." What are you hoping is going to happen today? What are you looking forward to? Well, it's the first time our foundation has actually had a sit-down roundtable conference with researchers in the cancer field. We're hoping to get a pla... A game plan together here in San Francisco to look at the problem we have with both the men and the women in this department contracting cancers at pretty alarming rates. We are fully aware of Technical Bulletin 117 that has been put in place since the 1970s here in the state of California that has to do with flame retardants. We know that it's an outdated standard. We know that the chemicals they use are carcinogenic. We know that the off gas during a fire, that off gas is furons and dioxin. WOMAN: I mean, this is a fundamental shift for us. Like, how many of you have walked into the station and you can smell smoke and you go [inhales], "They had a fire last night"? We've all done that. When I hear all this, I want to either go, "La la la la la, because I like my job, la la la la," or run out of the room. You know, one of the challenges we face in doing advocacy work is, you know, the chemical industry, which would like to continue to create these chemicals, are requiring or trying to sell the fact that we need incontrovertible evidence to take steps to regulate these chemicals. We are... you can't experiment on human beings. The closest we do is what we do to you, really, which is we send you into a bunch of really toxic environments, and you come out and we see what happens. And we don't even look that closely at what happens, and we should. And I think that's part of what we're trying to say here. But we're never... even if we... KERR STONE: I've had co-workers die in fires. And I've had a lot more die of cancer. It seems important that we do something. Before I joined the Fire Department, I was in research, working at UCSF. And so I ended up learning from Tony that they could use some help. Tony's starting to do research to try and link the specific chemicals that are released at different kinds of fires. I thought, "This is... I would love to do this. "This is fascinating. I can "cross-reference it online, and try and find out what's out there, and make this a little easier." Not to stop what we do, but to educate us. We have to make sure we're safe so that we can then take care of other people. Years ago, when Tony and I started this, in order to get attention for it, we put a pair of boots out on the steps of City Hall for every firefighter who died with their boots off. We wanted the world to know that a lot of firefighters die in a hospice, they die in a hospital bed, or they die at home. And they don't get the folded flag, and they don't get the hero's ceremony, but they should. And this is the first time since Tony and I have started this that I feel like someone's listening to our call for help. So, I wanted to thank you very much for doing this. We have a problem. We're contracting cancer. We can do so much to protect ourselves. But if we could eliminate the problem to begin with, the problem would no longer exist. Here we have this unique situation. California is, in a sense, causing poisoning of... Of the country and Canada, and maybe the world, when we should stop it here in its tracks. And so, how do you stop that? BLUM: You know, there is always a chance it could get through the Assembly. If we don't try, we'll never get anywhere. LENO, VOICE-OVER: We were working... Trying to work with the industry over the... somewhere... 5, 6, 7 years ago. One of my staffers suggested that I go to Berkeley on a Sunday night for a dinner party that a chemist from UC Berkeley was hosting at her home. This would be Arlene Blum. And that there would be some other community activists there, and the subject matter was the proliferation of brominated and chlorinated flame retardants in consumer products. And that Arlene was going to suggest that I author a bill that would ban these chemicals from these products, and begin to mitigate some of the damage that's been done to the environment. I think there's a snowball rolling here. So, maybe we might need to adjust this myth a little bit to reflect the great burden thing head on... There's gonna be above them agencies who are gonna have to... Is there fewer fire deaths, it's because of fire sprinklers and smoke detectors and not flame retardants. We need to organize the key people who should be interested in this. Putting these pieces together, calendaring out what the next couple months to a year is going to look like. MASCARENAS, VOICE-OVER: If we show that you can prevent these chemicals from being out there, that you don't have to go to the store and try and be a chemist, and look at every single label, and, you know, spend more money, or just not know if you're buying the safest thing for your family. If we can change that on the front end, that's what I'm dedicating my time to. BLUM: Welcome, Don. We were just talking about you. Oh, look what he brought... His nursing pillow. He's got a new baby. And there's chlorinated Tris inside. LUCAS: In a way, I fault the scientific community for not being more vocal in talking about these sort of things. And so, to me, the more scientists we get involved in the combustion aspects of this and the health aspects of this, the better the answer that we're going to get. So, Dr. Vito Babrauskas, we're very pleased to have you here today. BABRAUSKAS, VOICE-OVER: I felt a ethical obligation that I really don't want my profession to do harm in the name of promoting fire safety. CALLAHAN: The group that was lined up in support of changing Technical Bulletin 117, it wasn't just a few environmental activists. You know, it was firefighters who had been sick. And it was nursing moms. And it was public health advocates and it was scientists. It was a diverse group. Ultimately, here's what it all boils down to. My work of 40 years boils down to this. Either you have people behind you or money behind you. And we don't have the money. [Birds cawing] Boat mail today. We're getting boat mail today. WOMAN: This is an island of 350 people. Literally you have to be involved to live in this town. WOMAN: Aww. I don't want to kiss that baby. PINGREE, VOICE-OVER: So, I grew up with the sense that if you want to fix something, everybody has got to pitch in and help. Wait. Let me see on... I think I had a cell phone for her somewhere. WOMAN: I would like to introduce the Maine Speaker of the House, Representative Hannah Pingree. Welcome to the State House... PINGREE, VOICE-OVER: I think I was... 2003, 2004, I was a freshman legislator. And a group of folks who work on environmental issues said, you know, "We're thinking "about putting forward this bill to ban "the group of brominated flame retardants. "And we need a legislator who's kind of willing to take on a fight against the chemical industry." And for some reason, they decided that a 25-year-old legislator was the right choice. And, of course, you know, I was up for big fights, and I was like, "Let's go for it." When they first came to me, you know, even the name of all the chemicals... Penta, octa, deca... I mean, it was like chemical soup. But the more I learned about the issue, the more I thought, "This is absolutely outrageous that, "you know, our entire environment is filled "with these chemicals "and no one's really talking about it. No one's really taking action on it." I had my own body tested in 2006 for toxic chemicals. I said, "I'm willing to do this." I was one of 13 Mainers tested. I said, "I'm willing to do this "for the stake of, you know, good public policy and science. Sure, you can have my hair, blood, and urine." I always thought, you know, here I am. I grew up on this beautiful island off the coast of Maine. You know, I spent a few years living in cities, but I've mostly lived on this island or in this very clean place. So, when I had my body tested, I assumed I would be better off than most of the people who lived, you know, even in more industrial areas of my state. But when the results came back, and I saw that I had all these chemicals in my body, including flame retardants, including mercury and arsenic and, you know, BPA and phthalates at levels that were high enough to impact my health or the health of a developing, you know, child, I suddenly... You know, I went from being a policy maker who cared about this to a person who was, you know, really angry about the fact that this could be impacting my health. It's one thing to say to the chemical industry, you know, "More Americans "have these flame retardants in them compared to Europe, where they've started to phase them out." And you can make a real technical argument. But when you can say, "I have these flame retardants in me." And, you know, it makes me angry. You know, Maine doesn't require flame retardants to be in our couches or computers. This came from, you know, the state of California and that's now impacting me all the way on the other coast, in Maine. You know, it's a good lesson in public policy, but it's also something that should make a lot of people angry. ♪ I ask you to consider today that the real motivation of our opponents is to sell more fire retardants at any cost, including the health and safety not only of our kids, but of every human generation hereafter through genetic mutation and lingering poisons that have contaminated our homes, our waters, our wildlife, and even our mothers' milk. AB706 provides a robust framework... LENO, VOICE-OVER: The first time that we introduced a bill on the subject, the chemical industry spent over $6 million on a multimedia, multi-million dollar campaign of full-page color ads in newspapers up and down the state of California... Radio commercials, robocalls, mailers to households, and television commercials... Urging voters to contact their state legislator to vote against this bill. FEMALE VOICE ON TV: The California legislature is considering a bill that will endanger our children. We cannot afford to take our safety for granted. The furnishings inside the average home will contribute to most of the flame spread and fire spread. So those furnishings need to be protected by a fire retardant material... They ran television commercials on TV in Maine for weeks, saying that Maine legislators were trying to ban this flame retardant that would literally cause people's homes to burn down. They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to convince the Maine people that the Maine legislature was about to do something very dangerous. And the entire campaign was based on fear that your house will burn down, your child will die of flames. I care about flame retardants and fire safety because I see what happens to burn survivors every day and I go though it myself every day, and as a result of that, I cannot support legislation which threatens to remove flame retardants from fabrics and other things that protect our people. FEMALE VOICE ON TV: Say no to laws that put our children in danger. This whole campaign of TV ads and newspaper ads and, you know, hiring an army of lobbyists, I mean, that's not something Maine sees very often. I mean, that happens maybe more often in New York or California. That never happens in Maine. LENO: Why would we want to tie ourself to something 35 years old, and close our minds to any possibility that we might know more now, and there might be a better way to address fire safety? CALLAHAN: There was a bill in California that would have changed Technical Bulletin 117. I went to that really not knowing what I was going to see. You're going to hear a lot of conflicting testimony today, and what I'd like to do is just to remind you... CALLAHAN: And there was a group called Citizens for Fire Safety that was fighting it. And I was really curious about Citizens for Fire Safety, really curious. MAN: Mr. Chairman, members. Joe Lang, representing Citizens for Fire Safety Institute... CALLAHAN: You know, rumor on the street was that Citizens for Fire Safety was the chemical industry. But I didn't see evidence that proved it. Was it really a front group? That was... you know, that was one of the questions. And I have to be able to pin it down. I have to be able to document it. It's not just rumor and innuendo. You got to prove it. And I think what fascinated me about Citizens for Fire Safety from the get-go was... their website. It had this picture of these 5 smiling children holding up a banner that said "Fire Safety" with a little heart dotting the "I." And behind them is a red brick fire station. You know, it could be on any corner in America. It was very... This very wholesome, Americana kind of picture of "We're all about fire safety." OK, so what they said was that they were "a coalition of fire professionals, educators, "community activists, burn centers, doctors, "fire departments, and industry leaders, "united to ensure that our country is protected by the highest standards of fire safety." We already have the highest fire safety standard of any state in the country. To change that standard, and yet somehow not compromise fire safety, it's just... It's not logical, it doesn't make sense, and it can't be done. You know, right from the start, lots of chemical industry people showed up and told us that all the science that had come out was false, and everything we were saying was baloney. So, clearly, they had a lot at stake. I mean, this young legislator in this tiny state of Maine was taking on a chemical that was making a lot of money for them. Flame retardants are important to do the job to save lives. Thank you. STEFANI: My name is Tony Stefani. I'm a retired captain with the San Francisco Fire Department... STEFANI, VOICE-OVER: I spoke on behalf of Senate Bill 147. And I watched the state senators on the subcommittee actually not even pay attention to the testimony that was being given by experts, scientists that say that this technical bulletin has to be changed. There are safer products out there that can be used. But I did see them perk up when they had people there from the chemical industry talk. It was pretty discouraging. That if we continue to ban chemicals that are developed before they're used, we won't have any chemicals to use, and you won't be able to create the new jobs that people want to create here in California. And I do want to point out, once again, that as I was surrounded by this opposition, I was the only one at this table that was not receiving dollars from the chemical industry. AstroTurf organizations are a phenomenon that's from the, you know, sort of the mid-to late 20th century, where corporate America decided, "Oh, there's ways to create "phony groups that appear to be consumer groups. But what they do and work on is our agenda." So, what do they do is, quote unquote, "Citizen non-profit doing fire prevention." They give grants to fire departments. They worked their way in with their line of BS. They donate money to different funding activities that a fire department might be doing. But the the back lot activity is sort of sickening. A couple partners called and asked us about flame retardants. They were all communities of color, and they had been contacted by Citizens for Fire Safety because Citizens for Fire Safety was saying that, "Your community is affected more by fires. "Therefore, this legislation in California is going to cause more fires and deaths in your community." Tim Martinez, Hispanic Chamber of Stanislaus County. We oppose the measure. MALE VOICE ON TV: Thank you. MASCARENAS: They convinced them that these are crazy environmentalists and all they want to do is, you know, all they want to do is protect the environment, not people. WOMAN: My name is Kiki Vo, I'm a burn survivor, and I greatly oppose this bill. We were, are outraged. It's exploitation. It's manipulative. Imagine hearing someone you love say, "I love you," and that might be the last time that you will hear them say that. So please vote no on SB 772, and keep us safe from fire. WOMAN: Thank you for your testimony. So, when you look into Citizens for Fire Safety, here's what you find. You know, people think that investigative reporting is, you know, meeting with mysterious tipsters in parking garages, and mostly it's just looking through really boring documents and finding little puzzle pieces, little gems. So this is one of the gems. So this is the 2010 franchise tax report that they filed with the state of Delaware. And you have to list your headquarters, your principal place of business. And sure enough, when I looked up this address in Reno, Nevada, it's just a mail forwarding service. It literally is 24-hour access at a prestigious California Avenue address in tax-free Nevada. So, its headquarters, according to this form, is a mail forwarding service. That piqued my interest. But again, I still didn't have who are the members? There's still a chance that they could be truly a broad coalition, right? So, sure enough, good, old California form 602. You have to list the number of members in your association. It says, "Check appropriate box." So they check the "50 or less." Well, in parentheses, it says, "Provide names of all members on an attachment." So you would think there would be an attachment there, right? This is all online. If you look at that document, there's no attachment. There was no list. So I asked the Secretary of State's Office in California to go through their archives and find that list. It's a public record. It's not like I was asking for a favor. It's a public record. It should've been in there. So, sure enough, the day that this arrived, it was a very, very big day for me because here is the list of the Citizens for Fire Safety Institute member list. Take a look. Is it a broad coalition? No. It is the 3 largest makers of flame retardants in the world. And ultimately, one of my colleagues flew over the plant where they make their flame retardants. And it's not a red brick fire station. It's an industrial compound and everything you would imagine a chemical company would be. This was one of those moments, though, in the reporting where had they showed up and said, you know, "We are the chemical... "we are the voice of the chemical industry and here are the reasons why we think this law is wrong," I might have walked away from it at that point. But that's not what they did. They were lying. The group was presenting itself as something it was not. And it was presenting itself to the public, it was presenting itself to firefighters, it was presenting itself to state legislatures... as something it wasn't. [Dog barking] ♪ PINGREE, VOICE-OVER: Chemical industry had a huge amount of money, lots of scare tactics. They were doing everything possible. They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to influence Mainers and Maine legislators. And they had so little impact in the end.

I had no clue the kind of opposition we were going to be facing. To determine the safety of chemicals used to meet California's... LENO, VOICE-OVER: The first year, we just wanted an outright ban.

LENO, VOICE-OVER: We were defeated by the chemical industry yet again. But so then we thought, "OK, we'll address it another way.

WOMAN: Whether it's lead, mercury, or flame retardants, the assumption is that somebody's minding the store, and that somebody is trying to prevent harm and prevent exposure. And we have this burden of proof to show you that we've been harmed. That's a standard that is very difficult for many communities to meet. And they rely on you to protect them from this.

How one agency can then do the science on 84,000 chemicals with another thousand or so being invented each year and say, categorically, "This one's safe, this one's not safe," on the budget they have is just ridiculous.

Neurodevelopmental, neurodevelopmental." ♪ Our meeting starts at 10 a.m. this morning. I'm ready. BOXER: The hearing will come to order. The purpose of this hearing is to review the need to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act, otherwise known as TSCA, the primary law that regulates chemicals in this country. STEFANI: What we understand right now is that these are important chemicals that have to be dealt with because of their bioaccumulative process that is actually proven in medical science right now. MAN: OK. My name is Hannah Pingree, and I thank you for this invitation. I am here as the former Speaker of the Maine House. PINGREE, VOICE-OVER: The fact that Washington is now really seemingly paying attention is exciting. I definitely did not imagine myself, you know, sitting next to the Chemtura lobbyists and the other industry lobbyists, and a great California firefighter. But I, you know, I felt good about it. I felt like, "I am exactly what we're talking about. "I am a pregnant woman who is being impacted by these chemicals and so I should be here." The Senate bill would mandate a new round of EPA review for every new use of a previously approved chemical, and every significant increase in use of an existing chemical. The implications for EPA's overburdened resources, for EPA's ability to prioritize, and for industry's ability to innovate would be very significant. MAN: Let me try to get an answer to my first question. Does Chemtura concede any danger from its... From these two flame retardants that you've identified? Again, in terms of the expected exposures, in 2006 EPSE published expected exposures and predicted exposures of TBB. And those are much lower than any level that would e... Was predicted to have any sort of an effect. So, in those terms, the answer to your question would be that, no, those are, those are safe. MAN: They're perfectly safe. OK. In Maine, we had an industry front group. We had many of the companies represented at this table, the American Chemistry Council, spending huge amounts of money, misleading legislators, and doing whatever they could. I don't trust these companies to tell the truth about their chemicals, and I don't think the American public or you, as senators, should, either. BOXER: I want to thank all of you for coming here today. So I have a question I want each of you to answer yes or no. There's no other answer, just yes or no. And I'm gonna start with Hannah. Do you agree that chemical manufacturers should have to prove through unbiased studies that their products are safe for pregnant women, for infants, and for children before they can sell those chemicals in the United States? Yes. STAPLETON: Yes. I... yes, I agree. Could you repeat the question? BOXER: Do you agree that chemical manufacturers should have to prove through unbiased studies that their products are safe for pregnant women, for infants, and for children before they can sell those chemicals in the United States? Respectfully... BOXER: No, not respectfully. Yes or no. The question cannot be answered without explanation. BOXER: Mr. Stefani. Yes. BOXER: Thank you. Let me just say, I know that it's a little harder for lawyers to answer yes or no. But this one? ♪ PINGREE, VOICE-OVER: The fact that they are holding hearings and paying attention is a big deal. They got that it wasn't just about flame retardants. It was about the big picture. But the reality is, the American Chemistry Council is working absolutely overtime to try to influence members of Congress to stop this bill. They know that it has traction with the American public, so they don't want it to get out really into the light of the day. If it's on the floor of the Senate, they know it's problematic. Because when you get a group of moms angry, politicians don't want to be on the other side of them. [Chanting "Toxic chemicals got to go"] We brought the signatures of 130,000 Americans with us, gathered by... [Crowd cheering] We are delivering these signatures to our senators to show how many people want action. When people's voices are heard, you know, retailers might start taking action. Those kinds of changes are happening. But the only reason they happen is that regular people have stood up and said, "Look. "We're... we don't want to... You know, we don't want to take it anymore." So if there's a furniture company that wants to be a part of the solution, we want to meet with them, we want to collaborate with them, we want to actually triangulate with them to force the chemical companies to stop making those furniture companies to use their chemicals. And then, for companies that actually are just looking for a quick buck, we're gonna kick them in the nuts and force them to stop. ♪ Citizens for Fire Safety, they folded. So... they said they're folded. The website with the smiling children and the red brick Americana firehouse, that doesn't exist anymore. You know, I think the big question is, will the world change? It's not just our furniture. It's not just California Technical Bulletin 117. It really is about how we, as a society, view chemicals, how we vet them or don't vet them. And who are we listening to when we're being told these chemicals are safe, they work, they protect us, they're essential to our lives? Who are we listening to? That's really, I think, the crux of it. STEFANI: So we're really excited about the new Technical Bulletin 117 2013 that's going to be put in place to eliminate these toxic chemicals. Well, I'm optimistic when a small band of a thousand people or two thousand people can take on a multi-billion- dollar industry and say we will stop you from using those poisonous chemicals in our furniture. We did that on people power. However, I don't think that we can celebrate yet. I hope that what we did in California is, in a way, inspirational for the rest of the country, to in their legislatures, in Congress and so on, to turn the spigot off on these poisons and have sane chemical policy. Do you want some milk? Yeah. KERR STONE, VOICE-OVER: His name is Graham Alison Kerr Stone. And Graham is a family name. And then Alison is our friend who passed away, Alison Greene. So we said, first baby, we said, "OK, it's a boy. "We'll give this another shot. If we have a girl, she can have Alison as her middle name." Well, we have a boy with Alison as his middle name. Right after her... in her memory and her spirit. ♪ STEFANI, VOICE-OVER: Seeing firefighters that I worked with for years succumb to this hideous disease called cancer, it has a profound effect on my life on a daily basis. I know when I came in in 1974, I was not concerned about cancer. It was the last thing on my mind. Every time that we rolled out our doors, we were going out for one reason, and that was to help somebody. And when you have a big fire, it gets to the point where, OK, we draw the line right here, and this is as far as that fire is going to go. We're going to put it out. You don't let the fire win. We win.
