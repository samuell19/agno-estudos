Here you are, ladies and gents. Get a cane ! Get a whip ! Here you are, son. Here's a balloon for you. Just a copper penny. Balloons here. One penny. One copper penny. Balloons here. Get your tickets for the main show ! My balloon ! I want my balloon ! Hurry, hurry ! [ Chattering ] Step right in and enjoy the show. Hurry now. Step in and enjoy the show. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Are you goin' in ? No, sir. Step in and enjoy the show, gentlemen. There you are, little lady. And thank you, madam. Thank you very much. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up. Here they are. Fresh roasted peanuts. Peanuts, popcorn, candied apples and Taffy... Are all fresh and are all delicious. All right, folks. Step right up. Step right up here. The peanuts are grown on the plantation... And they're roasted right here on the premises. Are you a looker or a buyer ? About how many peanuts would you say I could get for a penny ? Well, now, young sir, in the normal course of business, - I don't usually sell them by the penny. - Oh. However, seeing as how you're a handsome young rooster with cash money in hand, I devise I might part with say... - Six genuine plantation-grown Georgian goobers. - Six ? That's more than you get if you bought 'em by the bag, and that's a solemn fact. Here. [ Whistle blowing ] All right, folks, step right up here. Here it is. It's all fresh and it's all refreshing. Nice and cold. Nice and refreshing. Plantation peanuts. Can you swap the ones back that are bad ? Bad ? I don't vend bad peanuts in my establishment, boy. Maybe a little underbred. Perhaps timeworn. But not really bad. Tastes bad. Here's two more. Run along. You'll miss the best part of the show. Oh, I'm not goin'. Not going ? Ah, you lack the price of a ticket. Yes, sir. I suppose your parents are bringing you tonight. No, sir. I don't have any parents. [ Whistle blowing ] Orphan boy, eh ? Well ! Have you ever thought of joining the circus, lad ? Me ? Imagine... being a part of the glorious confraternity of the big top, that exalted company of artistes... Who travel the length and breadth of this great land of ours. How would you like that ? But what could I do ? You... could become... A concessionaire. I could ? - A con-- - concessionaire. R-R-Rolls out on the tongue mighty important, don't it, boy ? Yes, sir. Free transportation, snug place to sleep, all you can eat, see the performance anytime you please, rub shoulders with the great and near-great. And as if that weren't enough, each and every Saturday night, yours truly-- Harry tupper-- will present you... With one of these. What do you say, lad ? Is it a bargain ? I'd like that better than anything else in the whole world. You would, eh ? The only trouble is uncle Daniel and aunt olive need me. Aunt and uncle ? They're awful poor, and there's lots of work for me to do around the farm. I understand. It does you credit, my boy. I'm a loyal man myself... And I love to see it in others. Well, I could ask them. Don't bother giving it another thought. I'll just pick up a boy in the next town. Plenty of 'em be glad for such a golden opportunity. Yes, sir. Anyway, thank you. Wait a minute. Come here. Just so's you and I part the best of friends, here's a free pass for tonight's performance. But mister-- tat-tat. Come, bring a friend... And enjoy yourself courtesy of yours truly, Harry tupper. Mr. Tupper, i-- farewell, lad. Ice-cold lemonade ! It's pink, it's cold, it's refreshing ! Here we are ! Ice-cold lemonade ! It's pink, it's cold, it's refreshing ! Here you are ! Ice-cold lemonade ! [ Chickens clucking ] [ Clucking continues ] Hey, red ! Red ! Look at what I got here ! Look, red ! Guess what this is ? A genuine free pass to the circus. Look. [ Whinnies ] Yahoo ! Where have you been ? I said, where have you been ? Answer me. Oh, I'm sorry, uncle Daniel. I meant to come right back, but there was a parade. And then I happened to go by the circus grounds, and a man gave me a free pass. Look. Circus ? Did you know the hogs broke the fence down... Because you didn't feed 'em, and rooted up the turnip field, did you ? Toby, we counted on selling that crop. You know how we need money in the house. You're a shiftless, ungrateful boy. Don't be hard on him. Boys get skittish when a circus comes to town. He don't have a right to behave like other boys. - He's got no rights at all, and he knows why. - Don't say that to him. I'm a poor man, yet I took you in out of decency's sake... When no one else would have you. Daniel ! I don't see why we didn't send you to the county home in the first place. You're no kin to US. You're nothin' to US. Nothin' but a millstone around our necks. You don't mean that, Daniel. Now you just go up to bed and stay there. There'll be no place at supper for you. Those were cruel things to say. Get on with the supper, olive. [ Chattering ] Gangway there. Horses comin' through. All right, move those fingers out of the way ! [ Elephant trumpeting ] Guy out over here ! Tim, guy out ! Over here ! Mr. Tupper. Mr. Tupper. Here I am, Mr. Tupper. Well, what of it ? Don't you remember me, Mr. Tupper ? You said I could work for you. So ? I'm ready. All right, move it, move it ! What about that aunt and uncle ? Well, it's all right. They don't want me. They said I was a millstone around their necks. [ Horse whinnying ] All right, you got the job. Fifty cents a week. But today you said a dollar. If Harry tupper said a dollar, he meant a dollar, but don't let me catch you runnin' away... Once I spend the time to teach you the business. It takes a lot out of me, boy. No, sir. Gentlemen's agreement. It's one of the most solemn things there is. Understand ? Yes, sir. All right, now you stay here and stay out of trouble. I'll be right back. Mr. Tupper ? Yes. I'm hungry. So ? I didn't have anything to eat for supper. [ Lions growling ] [ Sighs ] All right. Throw a blanket over the cage ! [ Elephant trumpets ] There you are, my boy. Nutritional gold from the indies. See that it lasts you till morning. Yes, sir. Give US a hand here, will you, olie ? Olie ! Chuck wagon's ready ! Come on ! Pull that back here, now ! Bring your horses ! Get some of this stuff back in there ! [ Men chattering, horse whinnying ] Steady. Steady ! Steady ! All right, clear that ball groove. [ Horse whinnying ] Clear that ball groove ! Hey ! [ Chattering ] What are you doin' ? - [ Shrieks ] - Give that back, you thief. [ High-pitched shriek ] [ Shrieking continues ] Here. What's goin' on ? What did you do to that chimp ? Me ? I didn't do a thing. He stole my banana. [ Shrieking ] All right, troublemaker, settle down. Now, as for you, you better get home. I thought I told you to stay out of trouble. He stole my banana. What's wrong here ? Uh, n-n-nothing, colonel. N-N-Nothing at all, sir. The chimp just got a little excited. Who's this ? Th-this is my new helper, sir. Picking them kind of small, aren't you ? Well, sir, he has no folks, the poor lad. I thought I might take him under my wing and kind of give him a helping hand. Spare me your kind intentions, tupper. Let's get these wagons moving. The boy can ride up top with Ben. Thunderation, colonel. Why pick me to wet-nurse tupper's sniveling brats ? Trim your wagon, Ben. We're moving. Olie, get these sideboards up ! [ Horse whinnying ] Mr. Tupper ? Hmm ? Oh. I kind of changed my mind. [ Stammering ] Oh, now, lad. Now listen. D-Don't you worry none about our rough ways. No, sir. We don't mean a thing by it, not a blessed thing. No. Now, here, look. Look what Mr. Tupper has here for you. There's a bag for you... Of peppermint jaws. Uh-huh. And that should last you till morning. [ Lions growling ] [ Elephant trumpeting ] All right now, lad. Right up this ladder here. Let me get that for you. You're gonna be snug as a mouse up there. Mr. Carter will take good care of you. [ Man ] All right, keep them cats covered when you move 'em. Colonel castle says you ride with me, you ride. Get a tight tailhold on yourself, Sonny. Bess, will, ha ! Good. Get up. Now let's get one thing straight. Me, I don't like kids, especially runaways. They're a weak-livered lot. A kid has a good home. The first time some little thing goes wrong, he runs away. Then he finds things don't suit him just right... And wants to run back home again. Go ahead, jump. Nobody'll miss you. I doubt you're worth missing. Jump ! Don't be scared. I'm not scared. And I'm not scared of you either. Fair enough, Sonny. My name isn't Sonny. It's Toby Tyler. All right, Sonny. We'll call you Toby. Now, it's none of my business, Toby, but maybe you'd better catch some sleep. Morning comes early with this outfit. I'm not sleepy. Suit yourself. ** [ Singing ] ** [ Continues ] * and away I go * I never know when and then mm, mm, mm * * it's better not knowing I don't care * ** [ Continues ] * and away go I hold there. Giddap, giddap. * not too sad * my way of thinking is not too bad * * never know when and mm, mm, mm, mm * * it's better not knowing I don't care ** [ Elephant trumpeting ] You better be up and doing, boy, before Harry tupper comes looking for you. Thanks for taking care of me last night, Ben. I guess I fell asleep. It don't mean nothin' to me one way or another. I just didn't want you fallin' off the wagon and me gettin' blamed for it. Anyway, thanks. I won't bother you anymore. I'm sure glad to hear that. [ Monkey chattering ] [ Shrieking ] [ Horse whinnies ] [ Man ] Hey, get Mrs. Conner and those girls over here. [ Lions growling ] [ Man ] Hey ! [ Lions growling ] For a big fella, he sure throws a puny shadow, don't he ? He sure does. You reckon I ought to tell him his apron strings is draggin' ? I didn't-- I didn't say nothin'. [ Man ] Hey, have you seen this big wagon ? Should I wash up here ? That's water, ain't it ? Yes, sir. All right. Now you do me a favor and keep out of my way. What's the matter ? You sure got a bad temper, mister. Don't let that bother ya. You're working for Harry tupper, a real fine fella. - At least he's friendly. - Oh, sure. And just by happenstance, here's Mr. Friendly himself come lookin' for you. What's the idea of making me chase all over camp for you ? Morning, Mr. Tupper. I was just washing up. Not on my time, you aren't. Come on. Come on. Run along. Move it along. Come on. Step it along. [ Sighs ] Now look. We don't want to be wool gathering all over camp... When there's work to be done, now, do we ? Now, let's move along, boy. Let's-- let-- let-- - put me down ! - No, Ben. It was my fault. You keep out of this, boy. It's got nothing to do with you. Take your dirty hands off of me. Oh, I aim to, Mr. Tupper. I aim to. Now, I don't believe in coddlin', Mr. Tupper, but, uh, I got my fill of you mistreatin' your helpers. It just don't sit well with me. That boy works for me, and I'll do what I want with him. Sure, Mr. Tupper, sure. You just tell him what you want him to do. If he don't do it, you can fire him. But, uh, if I ever catch you mistreatin' him again, well, I'm just liable to do something like this. No, Ben, don't ! As for you, you listen to Mr. Tupper. Work hard and do your job right. He's your employer, and you be respectful to him. Yes, sir. Now you can go to work as soon as you've had your breakfast. Cookhouse is down there. Well ? [ Elephant trumpeting ] Why, Mr. Tupper, you're all wet. Here. ** [ Singing ] ** [ Continues ] * away they go * [ chattering ] Here ya are. Thanks. Why don't you sit over here ? Oh, thank you. - You're new around here, aren't you ? - Yes, ma'am. Who's that ? I was just trying to find out. You're not supposed to be here, you know ? This is a performer's table. - Stop it, ajax. I asked him to sit down. - Did you hear what I said ? And look at me when I talk to you ! Oh, ajax, let him alone ! He's not supposed to be at our table. Go on, get away. [ Clears throat ] Well, well, there you are, my boy. Colonel castle specially asked me to look out for you. Me ? Mm-hmm. Oh, are you taking a professional nom de plume this season... Or do you plan to use your own name ? I guess I'll use my own name. Which is-- Toby Tyler. Toby Tyler, of course. Wonderful name. I've always liked it. Oh, may I present mademoiselle Jeanette and monsieur ajax. You've heard of Toby Tyler, of course. [ Stammering ] Well, gosh, I didn't know who he was. [ Chuckles ] It's a little late for apologies. Will you do me the honor of having breakfast with my family and me ? Yes, sir. Fine. Right this way. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Sam treat, circus clown. A clown ? At your service. Ow ! [ Chuckling ] Oh, what is it that you do with the circus, Mr. Tyler ? Oh, I'm a con-- "constashionaire." A "constashionaire" ? [ Chuckling ] Papa Schultz used to say, "what would a circus be without a 'constashionaire' ?" [ Chuckling ] [ Chuckling ] Come on. Kids are sure gonna be glad to meet you. How big of a family do you have ? Oh, it depends. Most of the time I'd say somewhere between four and five. Sit down. Thanks. All right, kids. Breakfast ! Gosh ! When you said you had a family, I thought that you-- it's all right. They're family to me. Not what you're used to, I suppose. To tell you the truth, I don't have a regular family either. -That's why I joined the circus. -Is that so ? I ran away, you know ? I never would've guessed. It wasn't because they didn't want me, but they're awful poor, and I was a millstone around their necks. Millstone, huh ? That's pretty bad. Sure is. You, uh-- you figure you'll never go back ? I guess not. At least ways, not until I can earn enough money to bring home... To show 'em I'm not what they said I was. You know, papa Schultz used to say, "happiness you should spend around, "and it would come back even more so. Money, you should save in something." Who is papa Schultz ? An old clown I used to know. I always wanted to make people happy the way he did. That's why I ran away with the circus. You ran away too ? Papa gave me this pouch to save money in. He said, "the circus... "Is for elephants 'und' papa Schultz. Everybody else should take the money and go home." But you didn't. There you are, Toby. Save your money. Don't wait'll it's too late. Thank you, Mr. Treat. I'll save all my money and work real hard... And do everything Mr. Tupper tells me. And-- oh, my gosh ! - What's the matter ? - I forgot. Mr. Tupper's waitin' for me. Bye. Bye. Bye. Come back again. [ Whistle blowing ] ** peanuts, popcorn, candied apples ! [ Crowd gasping ] ** [ Band ] [ Tupper ] Peanuts ! Peanuts, popcorn, candied apples ! Peanuts, popcorn, candied apples ! All right, folks.

Ice-cold lemonade here. It's pink, it's cold, it's refreshing. Dollar, thirty, thirty-five, forty, sixty, sixty-fi-- what's that ? Why, you blithering greenhorn. Don't you know any better than to take a lead slug ? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tupper. I don't know that much about money. Oh, you don't. Oh, well, then I'll teach you. And here is lesson number one: I'm going to replace this slug... With a nickel from your first week's pay. Yes, sir. What do I do with these ? Where did you get them ? They were left over. When I tried to give 'em back, they said, "keep the change." That, my lad, is what is known in circus parlance as a tip. Understand ? No. Good. Now there's an old circus custom... That all tips belong to the head concessionaire. That's me. Yes, sir. However, if you report all your tips, I will split them with you. Thus, a dime for me, and a nickel for you. Thank you, sir. But... You must promise... To keep our little arrangement a secret. You see, in the circus world, you must pretend to have a hard nature. I wouldn't want folks to think that, uh, I was a softy. [ Both chuckling ] Now get busy and clean up that mess. [ Chattering softly ] [ Chattering continues ] [ Shrieking ] [ Shrieking ] [ Shrieking continues ] Why, you little-- Mr. Tupper'll skin me alive ! I hope you get sick ! I hope you get so sick that you turn green. [ Shrieking ] [ Shrieking continues ] He's awful sick, isn't he ? Don't look too good, that's a fact. It's all my fault. I didn't want him to get that sick. This fella'll eat anything. Sometimes I think he's part ostrich. Let's see here. A trunk key. [ Whimpering ] A button hook. A hairbrush. A piece of clothesline. You sure scared me. Don't worry about this fella. You couldn't even hurt him with a-- [ imitating papa Schultz ] He's almost indestric-- uh, indestructib-- - you couldn't do it. - Do you think you can fix him up ? I always have. [ Chattering ] Old reliable. Castor oil. [ Barking ] Now get a good grip on him, and I'll give him a couple of spoonfuls. Gosh, I wanted to make friends with him. He'll never forgive me for this. Hang on tight. Don't let him bite ya. [ Whimpering ] There we are. [ Shrieking ] H-hold still. [ Shrieking continues ] Easy, easy, e-- [ Shrieking stops ] Now hold him tight. Sure hate to put him back in that old monkey cage. Well, it might be a good idea to keep him warm tonight. Here. Wrap him in this. Maybe he can sleep with me tonight. You better ask Ben. The monks are his responsibility. Thanks, Mr. Treat. Good night. [ Horse whinnying ] We're gonna be real good friends now, aren't we, Mr. Stubbs ? Stubbs ? Why Mr. Stubbs ? He reminds me of old Mr. Stubbs. He runs the general store back home. We sure are real good friends. That's gonna be US, Mr. Stubbs. How I ever let you sweet-talk me into this, I don't know. Colonel castle's number one rule is: Animals ride in the cages where they belong ! Don't you think he's lookin' better ? I bet he'll be his old self in the morning. That'll be real nice. Hiya, ya ! Move, now ! Wake up, Toby. Wake up ! What time is it ? Late. Canvas wagon had a breakdown during the night. Maybe I ought to find Mr. Tupper. He'll be lookin' for m-- you hold your seat. We're gonna parade straight into woodvale. We'll set canvas afterwards. You mean, I get to ride in a parade ? Yeah. Here. You wanna be circus ? Look circus. How about a hat for Mr. Stubbs ? Never mind about that. Whatever you do, just hang on to that chimp. - Don't ya think he's lookin' better, Ben ? - Yeah. [ Firecrackers popping ] Hey, I almost forgot. It's the fourth of July. That means firecrackers. Uh-huh. The big cats are sure gonna love them. Ha ! Giddap ! ** [ horse whinnying ] [ Growling ] ** [ Continues ] Steady now ! [ Whinnying ] [ Popping ] [ Shrieking ] [ Ben ] Hold up ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Stop ! Jump, Toby ! Jump ! There's a kid under that wagon ! Get that kid out of there ! Look out ! Look out ! [ Crowd murmuring ] Toby, are you all right ? Yeah, sure. Thanks, boys. How the devil did this happen ? Chimp was loose, colonel. Got scared of the fireworks and rattled up the horses. - How'd the chimp get loose ? - My fault. He was riding up top with me. You know the rules, Ben ! You're through ! See me after the show ! The monkeys ! Olie, olahah ! Get after those monks before they tear this town apart ! Mr. Stubbs. He's loose ! Keep those wagons moving ! Close it up ! Close it up ! ** [ Band ] [ Monkey chattering ] Mr. Stubbs ! [ Chattering continues ] ** [ Continues ] [ Gunshot fired ] Get down ! Take cover ! [ Chattering ] [ Chattering continues ] [ Chattering continues ] [ Gunshot fired ] [ Chattering continues ] Hey, son, get down ! That chimp in there's got my .45 ! Mr. Stubbs ! Get back down there ! [ Chattering continues ] He's got just one more shot. Rest easy, folks. That's the last bullet. Sheriff. Wait ! Get back there ! I hate to do this, but I'm gonna get him before he shoots someone. - No ! - Hey, come back here ! [ Chattering ] Oh, hi, Mr. Stubbs. It's me, Toby. Look out, boy. Don't rile him. [ Shrieking ] [ Gasping ] We're friends, Mr. Stubbs. Remember ? Careful with that gun. Good ol' boy. Easy. Easy, Mr. Stubbs. Good ol' boy. Good ol' Mr. Stubbs. Easy. Give it to me. Please ? No, Mr. Stubbs ! No ! - [ Shrieking ] - Mr. Stubbs. Too late to be sorry now. Come on. He didn't know it was loaded. Hey, sheriff, that chimp's pretty good with a shootin' iron. Yeah, maybe you ought to deputize him. [ Laughing ] Where you goin' ? I'm takin' a walk. Free country. Where you goin' ? I'm leavin'. Oh, plannin' on buyin' that livery stable you been thinkin' about ? Might. Well, good luck. Come in. Come in. [ Horse whinnying ] Why doesn't Ben just tell him it was my fault ? You know why Ben's so big ? He's just plain stuffed with mulehead pride. Well, Ben, it's been quite a day. Those runaway monks fiascoed US into the best business we've done all season. Telegraph from our advance man in kingsville. Says they've already sold out of blues for the performance there tomorrow. And listen to this. "Monkeys capture woodvale. "Boy disarms gun-toting chimpanzee. Animals celebrate independence day by making break for freedom." That busted wagon was the best thing that ever happened to US. Why the, uh, getup ? You tryin' to scare the animals ? I come by to pick up my pay, colonel. - Your pay ? What for ? - You fired me today. Oh, now, Ben, you know me. I was just lettin' off a little steam. What's the sense of runnin' my own show... If I can't get sore at people now and then ? If you'll just pay me the money that's rightful due-- oh, stop whimperin' about your money. Where's that boy, Tyler ? Toby ? He's outside. What's he got to do with this ? Toby ! Toby Tyler, come in here. Now, Toby, I want you and the chimpanzee to ride up on the monkey cage tomorrow. Folks in kingsville wanna look you over after those stories today. A chimp up on the seat ? Colonel, are you out of your mind ? That's what started the whole fracas today. Ben, with you in charge, I'm not worried about a thing. O-O-Oh, no. No, sir. You don't get around me that way. Toby, I'd like to thank you for saving that chimp's life today. He's kind of a pet of mine. I guess I've got a weakness for troublemakers. -That's why I like old Ben here. -Colonel. Seems like you handled that chimp pretty well. How would you like to take care of him ? Keep him out of mischief. You mean it, sir ? He's your responsibility. Now run along. Thank you, sir. Now, look, colonel. I don't think this whole thing is gonna work at all. What are you standin' around here for ? Climb out of that banker's suit and get those wagons movin' ! It's a long haul to kingsville. Welcome home, Ben. And where have you been ? Oh, I was-- I don't care what colonel castle says about that chimp. You just be sure he doesn't interfere with your work. Now I have to go into town on some business. You'll remember everything I told you ? Yes, sir. See that all the stock is locked in the green box, fetch enough water for all the jars, and it's Saturday. Saturday ? Yes, sir. The day you pay me. And what, my young creature, are you doing... With all the money I've been showering down on you the past couple of weeks ? Oh, I save it, sir. That's a slug, Mr. Tupper. So it is. Just wanted to see if you were on your toes. Here you are. And you make sure that chimp stays out of my stock box. Now I won't be gone long, and I want you to carry on with your work. Yes, sir. [ Lion growling ] Did you ever see so much money in your life, Mr. Stubbs ? Three dollars and forty-seven cents. I'm pretty near rich. Won't uncle Daniel be surprised when I bring all this money home ? Come on. I better tie you up. Let's go. I gotta go tie you up. Stay there. Now don't move. Here we go. Come on. Here we go. Sit down. I got a lot of chores to do, Mr. Stubbs. I better get started. [ Elephant trumpeting, lion growling ] Oh, come in ! Come on in ! Well, if it isn't the great peanut salesman ? Death-defying daredevil of the lemonade stand. Stop it, ajax. We haven't seen you around lately. Mr. Tupper kind of keeps me going. Well, sure. He's got an important job: Chasing flies away from the lemonade. Don't mind him, Toby. Oh, I don't. Next to Mr. Tupper, he's kind of friendly. That sure is a pretty horse. You like horses ? What would a peanut seller know about horses ? Hey, Jeanette, watch this. Oh. I do so know something about horses. It so happens I have a horse of my own. Toby, really ? His name's old red. Course he isn't really old. That's just his name. Is he a gaited horse ? Gaited ? You know, what gait does he favor most ? Oh, I guess he favors most the gate that leads down to the pasture. Lots of sweet clover down there. Toby, you're joking. [ Chuckling ] Hey, Jeanette ! Look at me ! Hey, that's pretty good. Don't look at him. He thinks whenever he's out in that ring, the whole world has to stop and watch him. Tell me some more about old red. Can he jump ? Hey, Jeanette ! Ajax, you know what the colonel said about practicing without the belt ! Who cares ? Just keep watching ! Ajax ! [ Screaming ] Ajax ! Get away from me. [ Moaning, gasping ] It's pretty bad. Get him to his tent. Move ! Careful of that leg. Both hands under it. Easy, easy. Get the doctor. Quick ! Who's responsible for this ? Who let that boy practice without the belt ? Ben, where were you ? Never mind. I was out-- never mind. Don't bother me with it now. Question is: Now what ? Here we are, going into our peak playing time, and our top act goes up the chimney. Well, what do we do about it ? Colonel. What ? Toby Tyler can ride. Who ? Who ? It's true. Toby's been riding since he was little. He has his own horse at home. You ! Toby ! Sorry, sir. I'll get right back to the lemonade stand. Can you ride ? Me ? Well, sir, it was just around the farm, kinda. Never mind that. Just so you had some experience. I'll take care of the rest. - But colonel, I don't think-- - that's good. Don't think. Jeanette, come stand over here next to Toby. Now let's see what we've got here. Sure. Sure. They jibe together like ham and beans. What do you think, Ben ? Now hold on, colonel. Yes, sir, we may have something here if we work it right. That right, Sam ? I think it's a great idea, colonel. Now you listen to me, Toby. Let's get this straight. We're gonna make a rasenback rider out of you. Understand ? It won't be easy, but by the eternal, that's exactly what's gonna happen. But, sir, I-I gotta work for Mr. Tupper. We got a gentlemen's agreement. I'll take care of tupper. All right, start the first thing tomorrow morning. We'll be at the county seat in waterford in two weeks. I want this boy riding by then. Now, take over. He's all yours. But colonel. Two weeks ? Well, I gotta be goin'. I'll see you later. I'll see you now. You heard the colonel. He's all ours. [ Chuckling ] Sure. Well, i-i-it just isn't fair, colonel. Toby Tyler is the best boy I ever had. You can't take him away from me. Will you stop whimpering and get out of here ? Find yourself another boy ! I don't want another boy. Customers like him. He brings a lot of tips. I-I-I mean money. Now, listen tupper, if you-- now, colonel. N-N-Now, colonel. Don't you go boilin' up. I know you're a hard man. You know, people say a lot of things about you. But I never heard no one say that you weren't fair and honest-- now don't you try to bear-grease me. [ Sighs ] Well, it-- you see, it-it's just that I feel responsible for that boy. He's liable to get hurt foolin' around them horses. Ben'll take good care of him. You know that. [ Sighs ] Yeah. Well, it just don't rest easy on my conscience. Well, just how much do you think it would take... To soothe that conscience of yours down ? [ Chuckles ] Well-- I don't like to put it in terms of money, but, uh-- how about $40 a week ? I figure the going rate on your conscience a lot lower than that. Let's make it ten. How does 30 sound to you ? It sounds like 15. Colonel. [ Stammering ] Colonel, I wanna help you. Now, I tell you what I'll do. No, Mr. Tupper ! I'll tell you what I'll do ! I'll give you $20 a week finder's fee for that boy ! If you say another word-- that's a very fair proposition, colonel. I'll just draw up a piece of paper sort of legal-like-- you'll what ? Let's make it a gentlemen's agreement. After all, if you and I can't trust one another, what kind of a world would this be ? Get out of here ! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Mm-hmm. Ben ? Yeah ? Did you ever tell a lie ? Same as anyone else. Kinda gave it up, though. Too much trouble. Any lamebrain can lie himself into somethin'. Then there's all that trouble of working yourself back out of it again. It's not worth it. - Ben ? I told one of those lies. - Don't say ? I can't ride. Not hardly at all. I know it. - When you figure on leavin' ? - How'd you know ? Ought to be a pretty good pile of coins in that pouch by now. I surmise you could buy a train ticket home... And still have money left over to give your uncle Daniel. Would you look after Mr. Stubbs ? He don't know I'm goin'. He won't starve. I'll come back someday and buy him from colonel castle. Sure. Why don't you get some sleep ? Ben ? Next to Mr. Stubbs, you and Sam are the best friends I got. -I'll sure hate to say good-bye. -Now, don't get all wrought up. A few weeks, you'll forget what I look like. I'll never forget you, Ben. Go to sleep. [ Clears throat ] ** [ Humming ] ** [ Humming continues ] Toby. Toby ! Better get up now. You got a big day ahead of you. Yes, sir. Mr. Stubbs ! My money ! Where is it ? Where's my money ? What'd you do with it ? Tell me ! [ Mr. Stubbs shrieking ] Tell me ! Tell me, Mr. Stubbs ! What'd you do with my money ? Tell me ! Tell me, Mr. Stubbs ! Tell me ! What's the trouble ? Ben, Mr. Stubbs threw my money away... And I looked all over for it. Why, the ornery, thieving little chimp. Why'd you do it, Mr. Stubbs ? - Take it easy, Toby. - That's what I get for makin' a friend out of him. Near as I can remember, colonel castle said he was your responsibility. You took him on, didn't ya ? Nobody made you do it. - No. - Well, then, don't go blamin' the chimp. But, Ben, all my money, my savings-- it's gone ! You think money is your only problem ? That's easy. Here. Take what I've got. There's enough to get you home and some left over. Go on ! Take it and get outta here before you get in any deeper ! You mean you don't want to run away ? You want to go on takin' care of this ungrateful little chimp ? [ Chatters ] You wanna go out in the practice ring today and work off... Some of that trouble you've lied yourself into ? All right. See you're in that ring at 11:00 sharp this morning. And don't think it's gonna be fun. Oh, that's a great trick, but let's learn to stand up first. Get back ! Back ! No, no. You go the same direction as the horse ! Keep a leg on each side and your mind in the middle. Keep your body limber. That's right. Steady. Steady. Hup, hup, hup, hup. Carry your weight low. Now, feel his motion through your feet. Go with it. Don't fight it. Whoa ! [ Chattering ] On your knees now ! Stand up ! Stand up ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Wait for the horse ! Hang on ! No, no. You're supposed to ride him, not kiss him ! - No, no, no. Let go of his ears ! - Whoa ! [ Mr. Stubbs chattering ] Stand up. - Hang on ! - It's no use ! I can't do it ! - That's just what ajax said. - He did, did he ? Yeah. He said you'd put your tail between your legs and quit the first day. Oh, yeah ? I'll show him ! Now let go of the rope. Let go ! That's better. It's not good, but it's better. Get off that horse now ! Get off ! [ Sighs ] Now get ready for the fourth jump. - Now ? - Yeah, now. And this time, watch your timin'. Get ready, set-- go ! I missed. It's not bad for a beginning. We'll work on the stand ups after lunch. Olie mathesson. Madam tanzini. Two for you. Greta neilssen, Toby Tyler. Harris tillford. Uh, Toby's busy now. I'll take that for him. Frank Vernon. Harry birch. Rufus rachen. "Dear Toby, we've had a very bad time. "I'm afraid your uncle Daniel is not well. "Without your help, the work around the farm is just too much for him. We need you, Toby"-- [ Toby ] Mr. Tupper ! You dropped somethin'. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Well, uh... how is, how is our star performer getting on ? Awful, but Ben says to come back after lunch. My boy, I have complete faith in you, and just to prove Harry tupper is not just sounding off his bazoo, look what I have for you. The best secondhand riding shoes money can buy. Now, I ask you: Is Mr. Tupper your friend or is he ? Mist-- but, but, but. There's no need to thank me. Now, you just forget your chores around here, run along and meet your friend, Mr. Stubbs. Mr. Tupper ? Hmm ? I don't know how to say this, but I wanna take back... Some of the things I thought about you. Yes... well, there's no need to mention it. I'll admit I'm not the most patient man in the world, but it's how we behave when the chips are down that really counts. Am I right ? ** [ Humming ] Ben ? Think I could tell my aunt and uncle I'm gonna be a bareback rider ? I don't see why not. Think I'll ever ride real good ? Well, you ain't no Pawnee bill, but by the time we open in waterford, you'll look like a professional... Or my name ain't Benjamin obadiah Carter. Ben, how do you spell "uncle" ? "Uncle" ? Well, now, that depends. Some parts of the country, you spell it one way; other parts, you spell it the other. - What part are we in ? - Drat it, boy. It's not the spellin' of a letter that's important. It's what you say in it. Now, did you tell the folks you missed 'em ? Not exactly. Well, then, did you say you loved 'em ? Folks put an awful lot of store in things like that. I love you very much. Cordially-- Ben, how do you spell "cordially" ? Why don't you sign it "your friend, Toby Tyler"... And stop botherin' me. [ Applause ] ** [ Band ] ** [ Snake charmer music ] [ Crowd laughing, applauding ] [ Whistle blown ] ** [ Fanfare ] You'd be scared too, if you had to go out in front of all those people. Well, how are we gettin' along ? Doesn't seem to fit too well. Well, let's see. Let's see could we do somethin' about that over there. Stay right there for a minute. Now, let's see here. If we take up the slack in the back here, I think maybe that the front, the front would be, uh-- the front is, uh-- turn around this way once because across here, it will-- ooh. If we did a sling-- "und" this doesn't look too-- it's awful, isn't it ? I think so. I don't think even magic could help it. Of course, there's all kinds of magic, you know. There's the magic where you got the hat "und" you take the rabbit, but this is no good for the-- oh-ho-ho-ho ! I got the magic. I got the right kind of magic. Close the eyes. "Und" keep 'em closed. Tight. Now, then, how does it go again ? Oh, yes. Needles and pins. Needles and pins. When you presto the changeo, the magic commences. Open the eyes. - Surprise ! - Good luck tonight, Toby. Monsieur Toby, in a few moments you will make your debut... As a featured performer in colonel castle's great American circus. - But i-- - shh ! And we, your fellow performers, not wishing to see the luster of this occasion dimmed... In any way-- especially from a sartorial point of view-- - what ? - Or as papa Schultz might say, "when you go in front of the people, you should never wear... "This ridicu-- this awful-- this-- the baggy pants. - You shouldn't do it." - [ Performers chuckle ] Good luck, Toby. Thanks. And here's the rest of it, Toby. You have just about three minutes to get dressed, monsieur Toby. ** ** [ "The blue danube" ] ** ** [ blowing whistle ] ** [ Continues ] Mr. Stubbs, have you seen my shoes ? [ Chattering ] Good night ! I left them over at the lemonade stand. Where's Toby ? Still dressing, I guess. Mr. Stubbs, how'd you get loose ? [ Distant applause ] [ Whistle blowing ] Toby ! ** [ Fanfare ] No, Mr. Stubbs ! "Master Toby Tyler" ? They're all for me. They're from aunt olive. - Mr. Stubbs, they did write ! - What the devil are you doin' here ? Look, Ben ! They did write ! You haven't got time for that. Now, come on ! Hurry ! I'll take care of the chimp. [ Blows whistle ] Now, ladies and gentlemen, we present for your kind approval... Those daring young equestrians... Mademoiselle Jeanette and monsieur Toby ! Jeanette and Toby ! Taffy candy, ice-cold lemonade. It's pink. It's cold. It's refreshing. I-- Uh, peanuts ! They're fresh roasted ! [ Blowing whistle ] [ Tempo increases ] ** [ Drumroll ] Lemonade here, folks. Here we are. It's pink. It's cold. It's refreshing. It's ice-cold lemonade. It's made... right-- ** [ Drumroll ] Peanuts ! They're fresh roasted ! [ Whistle blowing ] Toby, you rode like a champ ! You were just great ! Excuse me. I gotta read my letters. [ Chuckling ] [ Chuckling ] [ Aunt olive's voice ] We miss you so much, Toby, and wonder why you don't answer our letters. Your uncle Daniel is not well. He has taken over the chores you used to do, and with the rest of the work, it's too much for him. They want me to come home, Mr. Stubbs. They need me. I've gotta go before they try and stop me. ** [ Fanfare ] ** [ Drumroll ] I can't take you with me, you know, Mr. Stubbs. You don't belong to me. They'd say I "stoled" you. You understand, don't you ? I'll come back and get you someday. [ Hoots ] Honest, I will. [ Chattering ] [ Shrieking, chattering ] [ Background music ] [ Distant applause ] Toby ! Toby ! "Dear Ben and Sam, I am sorry to tell you this, but I am leaving the circus." That ungrateful little whelp. After all I've done for him. Good morning, gentlemen. Eh ? You got a phone ? Operator, get me the sheriff over to bartonsville. Yeah, it's important. Sheriff, this is Harry tupper representing castle's great American circus. Yeah. I want you to keep your eye open for a small boy about 11 years old. Calls himself Toby Tyler. I figure he's going in your direction. Well, he ran away from the circus last night. Took along a valuable animal belonging to colonel castle. A chimpanzee. Thanks, sheriff. Oh, say, sheriff, you find the boy, we'll be glad to express our appreciation. You know what I mean ? All right. Say, uh, I don't suppose either of you have glimpsed the lad. Nope. Oh, a hunter, eh ? Mm-hmm. Well, I suppose you know these parts around here pretty well. Some. Tell you what: You find that boy... And there's a reward of, say, $10 in it for you. Sorry. I'm not much on trackin' small boys. Bobcat's about fearsome enough for me. [ Clears throat ] Yeah. Well, suit yourself. [ Mr. Stubbs whimpering ] [ Whimpering continues ] [ Chatters ] Mr. Stubbs ! What are you doin' here ? They'll be after me for sure now, Mr. Stubbs. You know I'm glad to see ya, but gosh. [ Mimics ] Oh, well. As papa Schultz would say, "here we is 'und' where we is... "Is further away than where we was... "Next to where we're gonna be. "So, I take you home... 'Und' we write colonel castle where you is." Don't get your feet wet, Mr. Stubbs. * a biddle-Dee-Dee and a biddle-Dee-oh * ** [ Humming ] ** [ Humming continues ] * and I don't know where * ** [ Whistling ] ** [ Humming continues ] [ Chatters, screeches ] [ Carriage approaching ] Whoa. [ Mr. Stubbs chattering ] [ Whispers ] Quiet, Mr. Stubbs. Shh. We'll cut across this way. You raisin' somethin', Jasper ? [ Dog howling ] [ Screeches ] Mr. Stubbs ! [ Barking continues ] [ Barks echoing ] [ Screeching ] [ Barking ] Mr. Stubbs ! [ Barking continues ] [ Screeching continues ] [ Toby ] Mr. Stubbs ! [ Barking ] [ Screeching ] [ Barking continues ] [ Shot fired ] Mr. Stubbs ! Oh, Mr. Stubbs. [ Sobbing ] Oh, Mr. Stubbs. Please don't leave me. Don't leave me. [ Crying ] You did it ! You shot him. Why ? I didn't mean to. I thought it was something else. You killed him ! You're a murderer ! I'm sorry. Believe me, I'm sorry. Get away from US. [ Sobbing continues ] What's this ? What-- oh, Mr. Stubbs ! Don't leave me, Mr. Stubbs. [ Sobbing continues ] Well, now, Toby, that's, that's too bad. That's really too bad. You see now, Toby ? If you hadn't run away, this terrible thing wouldn't have happened. - It's your fault. - My fault ? Oh, surely you see that ? Mr. Stubbs would be alive and well if you hadn't run off. - Come on, let's go back. - I want Mr. Stubbs. Now, look ! Now, look, Toby, Mr. Stubbs is dead... And there's nothing you can do to change that, so come on. Maybe the colonel will give you another pet. No, I won't leave him ! Come on ! Just a minute. It wasn't the boy's fault. It was mine. That's quite all right, young fella. Accidents will happen. The important thing is we found the lad safe and sound. Hey ! Hey, wait a minute ! Wait ! Wait a minute ! I'll tell him ! Stop ! Colonel castle, I ran away... And Mr. Stubbs followed me. I didn't want it to happen. Honest, I didn't. Toby. Toby, there is someone here to see you. Toby ! [ Crying ] Toby, will you forgive me ? You Lily-livered skunk. I found out what you did with Toby's letters ! Now, now, Ben. I didn't want to upset the lad. Tamperin' with the mails, Mr. Tupper. That calls for a jail sentence. Oh, but it was just a little tamper. Mr. Tupper, I'm gonna make you one of those gentlemen's agreements you're so fond of. Fine, fine. I'd like that just fine. Anything you say. I want you to give up that share of Toby's money you been gettin'. Uh, Ben-- now, let's talk this over. You don't know what you're sayin'. I want you to stay away from that boy. Yes. Absolutely. Yes. And I want you to behave real nice and pretty. Yes. Depend on it. Oh, yes, sir. Because if you don't, I'm just liable to do somethin' like this. Yes, Ben. Yes. No, Ben ! No ! Happy to see you back, Toby. Thank you. Hi, Toby. Looks like a full house tonight. Do your best, now. I'll sure try. Good. You've made a lot of good friends, Toby. I just wish you could have met Mr. Stubbs. Colonel castle told US about him. This was his wagon. He was my best friend. Well, I see you're showin' the folks around, eh, Toby ? Uh-huh. Would you mind doing me a big favor... And go and tell Sam treat to meet me behind the stock tent right away ? Sure. Come on. Sam ! What are you doin' here ? [ Chattering ] Mr. Stubbs ! Oh, Mr. Stubbs ! Is he all right ? Bullet only ventilated his hide a little. Mr. Stubbs. Mr. Stubbs, Mr. Stubbs. [ Whistle blown ] Popcorn, candy... apples. Peanuts ? Yes, sir. Peanuts, popcorn, candy apples. [ Applause ] [ Whistle blown ] ** [ Fanfare ] ** [ Drumroll ] And now, may I direct your attention... To a feat of horsemanship and balance... Seldom witnessed in the sawdust ring. Ladies and gentlemen, monsieur Toby ! [ Applause continues ] Whoa ! [ Audience laughing ] [ Tempo increases ] [ Laughter continues ] Ice-cold lemonade here. It's pink. It's cold. It's refreshing. That little boy. Isn't he wonderful ? [ Together ] He's our boy. Ben ! Colonel, I'm sorry about-- Ben, this is the greatest yet ! Why didn't you tell me ? [ Quietly ] Well, I didn't know. Congratulations, Ben. Congratulations. [ Laughing continues ] We'll bill him as "monsieur stubbs." Peanuts, popcorn, lemonade. Pink. It's refreshing. It's cold. [ Whistle blown ]
