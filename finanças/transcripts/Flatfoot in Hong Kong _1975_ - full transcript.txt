(commentator chattering) (crowd cheering) Come on, come on, come on, look at them go, come on, Caligula! Come on, give me his head! Gonna make it, go! (crowd cheering) Told you those two horses were going to come in. I'm sorry, Don Pastrone, but I'd like to remind you that I'm the one who gave you the name of that horse. Don't worry, Pastrone never forgets his friends. Don Pastrone, bad news. It doesn't look good. Those two bastards Giovanni and Gatano have got themselves in trouble. They're being tailed by the cops. Don't worry about it, they know how to take care of themselves very well. (tires screeching) (sirens wailing) (radio chatter) What's happened to the people in narcotics division? Where is Rizzo? I always have to do everything around here. Find me Rizzo. Now where are we? Central to Parzi, central to Parzi. Hurry up with the soap, Pasquali, we need an alibi fast, they're right behind us. Hot soap coming up. Shave and a haircut? Hold it! Don't move! Did you report to headquarters? They're already on the way. Put the bracelets on both of them. Don't you want to question them? What is there to ask them, you want me to ask them if they're a couple of Patroni's men? You work for Pastrone? No! No, eh? You've never even heard of Pastrone? And you never push drugs to kids, isn't that right? You just never pushed drugs, eh? See, Caputo, why ask them anything? (praying silently) So, now we pray to Our Lady of the Automobile, eh? Take all of them away. And you, call headquarters and get a tow truck. The car's full of drugs. Come in, headquarters! (merchants yelling) Thanks for keeping us alive. I put aside a fresh macaroon just for you. Fresh macaroons? Send it over to my office. Asulda. Ah, Captain. Want a loaf of my delicious bread? Yeah, why not? I'll take this one. Jesus, Joseph, and the Blessed Mother! A sneak put those cartons in there! Someone must be trying to get me in trouble, momma mia! Oh please, don't take me to jail. Don't worry about it. I came here to buy a carton of cigarettes. I'm a smoker, too. You want a carton of Marlboros? Well take them, here! I'll wrap them for you. I'd like to pay. Well, thanks. Bless you, Captain. Bye bye. Thanks again, Captain, I'll say a prayer every night that you enjoy good health! Momma mia. Gennarino. Who is that? Now what are you doing with those bells? If you're deaf and blind, who are you trying to fool? And take off those glasses, you're giving me bad luck. Captain, I've got a dozen children and I haven't eaten in four days! Think of my poor, starving children! Come on, you'd like me to arrest you for fraud? Only I don't feel like it, so just keep moving. With all this extra weight, I feel lazy. Well, just starve like me and you'll begin to feel much better. Okay Captain, I'm going, I'll see you around. Let go of me, take your filthy hands off me! Shut up, keep moving! Where are you taking her? She just made her third escape from jail. And she's pretty smart, it's just a school for criminals. Let her go, get back on duty. Whatever you say, Captain. I'll put a curse on you! You won't have a moment of peace after today, pigs! Would you like me to read your fortune? Don't waste my time, gypsy. I can read your eyes and tell your fortune. I predict a long voyage, and soon, you'll be starting on it! To Bologna? Not much longer than that. But I've spent 20 years here in Naples. Your future holds a trip very soon to the other side of the Earth! Are you ready, Caputo? [Caputo] Yes, Captain, I'll be right there. Hurry up, it's late. And how do I look? You look repulsive. I can't help it. (phone ringing) Get the phone. Yes, Captain. Narcotics division, I'm Sergeant Caputo. Ah, Alogisi, I'm sorry. No, it's impossible, we can't meet tonight because I'm on duty, I've got to work tonight. But what other girls? Where are all these women? There aren't any. But I'm not lying. Please, tell her I'm on duty, she's calling me a liar. Huh, you want me to- - The woman's jealous, jealous! Oh Marone! Hello. Yes, that's right, Caputo's on duty with me tonight. Yes, I feel very badly about it. No, the three of us won't be able to get together to know each other better. No. I know, yes, alright. Why don't you be a man next time? Dressed like this? Relax, relax, you're as stiff as a piece of iron! But Captain, I've never played a woman before and I'm not exactly enjoying it! You'd better act like you're enjoying it. I know, but it isn't easy! Did you eat any garlic? Just one little piece! You stink so much, I'm trying to hold my breath. Well, I didn't expect this- - Hug me, hug me, make it look real, come on! Hey, Captain, you're squeezing me too hard! We've got to get into our act! You're breaking my arm! Hold your breath. I've got to breathe, and Captain, you're crushing me to death! You feel as if you probably weigh a ton! What are you talking about, I'm as light as a feather! You lie, Captain. Now come on, act like you like it! (wincing) Stop groaning in pain, groan as if you like it! Here they come, hug me! Love me! [Caputo] I love you, I love you! Hey, dirty old man, aren't you ashamed of yourself in front of all these people? What is it? What do you want? Nothing, we just want to have a little fun with your girlfriend. Come on, big boy, come on outside. Oh, there you are. You could've given me some help. How could I? I was supposed to be the woman. Oh, you were supposed to be the woman, eh? Well, let's take care of them, call headquarters, get the ambulance too. And change your clothes, you look ridiculous. Such ruffians! Well, Rizzo, so what have you got to say about this? Fracture of a nasal section with contusions and lacerations. At least 10 days in the hospital. Shall I continue with it? The whole thing's intolerable, Rizzo. You're a police officer, not a hoodlum. Your actions can't be justified, and I condemn them! You've got to stop using methods like that. Do you know anything about the five of them? You don't, eh? Well I'm gonna tell you. They grabbed a young girl out of a car, and then the five of them raped her. This is under the jurisdiction of the morals division. And narcotics is supposed to be your division, Captain. I picked up that girl in a narcotics raid. You should have seen how those punks worked her over. Because she was so ashamed, she took the drugs. And the punks were free to rape some more. If you knew who the men were, you should have made an arrest. Oh sure, so that 24 hours later, they could have been out on bail. In the hospital, they'll have plenty of time to think before they try it again. Now listen, Rizzo. You're going to get yourself in trouble, you know that. Unless you stop doing these things. Is there anything else? Yes, there is. I heard that you threatened Pastrone, that you'd like to smash his face. Come on, we're dealing with criminals, not dilettantes, Commissioner. It's well known that Pastrone's the number one man in narcotics here, and he's got to be made to talk. But this Pastrone is number one in narcotics and Naples hasn't been proved yet. The man's an antique dealer and respectable. Then I suppose he deals in antique drugs. We don't have any evidence against him, so for the time being, Mr. Pastrone is an innocent man, just like anybody else. I'll pin the rap on him. The operation has been scheduled for today, it should go pretty well. Alright, I want to be there. And let me warn you, Rizzo, you're going to see Sam Accardo there too. Yes. The chief of the United States narcotics bureau has flown over from Washington just to give us a hand. [Rizzo] He's one of our informants passing as a drug buyer. I'm hoping he'll lead us straight to Pastrone. We know there's a big shipment from the Orient around here. This time, I hope we see some positive results. You don't like my methods, do you, Accardo? I couldn't care less about your methods, it's what you accomplish that matters. What I don't like is your consistent refusal to cooperate with me. Where's the meeting? I don't know, they make them telephone at intervals. Look! Stay close behind him, Caputo. (phone ringing) Brilliant. Stupendous. The operation's over before it begins. Alright, let's go. You've been pacing for three hours, you must have done at least 40 kilometers. Are you trying to lose weight? No, Caputo, I don't want to lose weight, and besides, pretty soon, being fat will be the fashion. I'm upset because we look like such imbeciles to the narcotics bureau. You did look bad. Why is it that when we do something stupid it's always me, and when we do something good, it's always we? What were you doing when it happened? I was behind the wheel, what do I know? So you were behind the wheel of the car, are you trying to be cute? Captain, you better calm down. What's the matter with the way I'm acting? You better not calm down, Captain, you might as well stay upset, huh? Read me the telegram. It's a telex from Interpol, and it says that Frank Barella has landed in Rome from New York, and arrives in Naples in Air Italia flight number EZ 425 at half past 12. It's strange, nobody sends us any undesirables for six months. Look him up. Okay, Captain. Frank Barella, born in Howbacken, or however you say it, on the 11th of August, 1929. Undesirable, arrested in New York on the 12th of April 1958. Connected with narcotics traffic and involved in two attempted homicides. Barella was apprehended in his home on Long Island in 1972 and sentenced to deportation to Italy, stop. His movements should be watched, stop. As if we didn't have enough rats of our own, they have to send us one from the US. I think I'll go see what this money looks like in person. (speaking foreign language) I understand, lady, now just take it easy! What's all this screaming about? Nothing much, Captain, she just thinks somebody stole her purse right here in front of headquarters. Tell her there aren't any purse snatchers anywhere in the city. Tell her they kidnap foreign ladies, but only the pretty ones. Gennarino. Gennarino, get out of there. Yes, Captain. If anyone reads a story tomorrow in the newspaper saying that a tourist had her purse stolen in front of police headquarters, and that the thief hid in the captain's car, your neck will get broken. Captain, they might have locked me up forever and cut me into little pieces! I'm a four time loser! And besides, I have 13 children. But yesterday, you told me about having a dozen. Yes, but yesterday, I was presented with a precious new baby girl. She looks just like me, has my eyes, and so cuddly, so adorable, you should see her! Congratulations. Thanks, Captain. What am I doing congratulating? I want what you snatched! Oh, sure, here. You took this from the German lady? You've got to be crazy to grab that. But that's all she was carrying! You should be put in the booby hatch, not prison, for snatching it. What would happen to my precious little baby, then? Anyone with that many brats has to be crazy. I'm letting you off at the corner. Please. And I'll give the purse back. - Yes, Captain. - Now beat it. I'm Captain Rizzo. Watch out, Paisano, he's a hot one. Why, he's got a fever? Where we going? We are going to drink a toast to your arrival and captivity here. Hey, wait a minute. Have you got a warrant? I'm gonna call my lawyer. I know my rights. What lawyer, what rights? I just wanted to meet you and have a little chat. Why are you so hot in the collar? Well... Suppose we get to know each other in a restaurant then, eh? I don't eat no pasta on an airline, and I'm very hungry. I'm hungry, too, that's a good idea. You know something, Captain. Those Americans got a bunch of dummies working as FBI agents. Like, whenever they see a guy eating a plate of spaghetti, why do they always figure he's mafia? So you're a victim of an err in justice, is that right? I've done some things in my past. Stole to be able to eat. But I helped a friend out. But drugs? Uh-uh. Never. Now listen to me, Frank Barella, you're not talking to an idiot. Don't get excited. Here you are. You know something? Maybe I do have some information for you. Some good friends of mine told me that the number one in Naples is a guy called Pastrone. Pastrone? Yeah. And you came from the United States in an airplane to tell me that? Frank. We've been sent by a pal to welcome you. He's getting very impatient for a talk. Yeah, but I don't like being disturbed while I'm eating. You tell him to come here. Come on, let's avoid complication. I'll bring you over there. I don't like my lunch interrupted! Beat it! Scram! Get out of here. Hey, Paisan. Come here. Some wine, and some spaghetti. They must be crazy, those two guys! Alright, I'll bring the spaghetti right away. Okay. Captain, your friend damaged a lot of things in the restaurant, what am I supposed to do about the damage? Hey. It costs a lot. Here, take what you need. Ah, well, I'll take a hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, five- - No. Two. Two. After all, we didn't knock down your business. Course not, Captain, thank you. Alright, alright. You see, money takes care of everything. Without me giving you some muscle, you would have been killed. Barella, you're under special surveillance. You have to report to the station every other day. You have a room? At the Excelsior Hotel. Fancy place. I'm not a cop, you see. That's why I'm rich. Here, Captain. Want some of this? I'm fussy about what I eat, it would give me an awful belly ache. Now I've called you members of the Italian Police here for one reason. Because I think the drug situation in Naples has become ridiculous. Look, Accardo, we're not one of your colonies. The investigations, the police operations here are done by us, not your narcotics bureau. Look, my men called Frank Barella in just for a friendly chat. They were only trying to help. Now, there's only- - Those men you sent to get Barella were heavies, and the next time, I'll tear them to pieces. Rizzo, cool it. I'm trying to control myself, believe me, but to stop the drug traffic here, we've got to arrest the top men. But you know I don't have to tell you. Your inefficiency and incompetence are maybe something else. But let's get to the point. On the 12th of December, our office informed you that a shipment of heroin was on an incoming flight from the far east. You go down to the airport and find nothing. The fourth of January, we inform you another shipment is coming in by sea from Izmir. You go down to the port and find an old stack of newspapers instead of hashish. The 18th of January, you tell us you've been tipped off on a shipment that's been hidden in a coffin on a flight to Boston. The only thing found in Boston is a corpse! And I, myself, saw your latest efforts right here in Naples, our informant blown to bits in front of our very eyes. Need I say more? I can't believe that! Well, you'd better believe it, cause the bureau is sure of it. Your side is tipping off the syndicate every time we set a trap. Well, at least something's been cleared up. [Accardo] What do you mean? It looks as if one of us is undertaken, therefore, working for the number one dealer in Naples, Pastrone. And he's the one you've been stopping me from arresting, Commissioner. I've told you that there isn't any proof. No magistrate is going to sign a warrant for his arrest without it. And besides, he's got too much protection, we could never hold him. He'd bring in a battery of lawyers and be out in two hours. I'm sick of his lawyers, and he's being protected so well. If I don't do something, they're gonna keep treating us like a colony. I'll see Pastrone. Rizzo! I'm ordering you not to! (ringing bell) [Policeman] Get a shot from this angle. [Photographer] Right. Hey, let the doctor through. Nice work, Rizzo. Two men dead in 48 hours your way. Maybe you'll believe me now. If you want my help, you know where you can find me. The initial examination shows no signs of either knife wounds or a bullet having caused his death, but there are many bruises and contusions. This man has been beaten to death. And so, you disobeyed my orders not to come here. I know your methods. Maybe you just wanted to make him talk. Or prevent him from talking. I've told you that when I got here, Pastrone was dead. That's what you said. Now, I'll not conduct this sort of investigation. You're to remain on call. (70s dance music) Ferraminti? I'm Frank Barella. I'd like to talk to you. Yeah? Why? We haven't been introduced. This is for you. Thanks. Okay. Now we've been introduced. I want some answers, Junior. I don't know nothing! Oh no? You better cooperate. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't, eh? Hey. You hit Pastrone, didn't you? Look, I've got a big shipment coming into Naples, and you're gonna give me the name of that cop that works for the organization. I don't know his name. I want you to tell me who he is. I told you, I don't know. Pastrone's the only one that knew, and he wouldn't even have told his own mother. You can hit me again, do whatever you want to do with me, I still don't know nothing. Okay, alright. But you do know the organization, because I know you're on the payroll. I need your help. And you're gonna give it to me, right? Okay. Okay. Yes, miss, yes. That's right, Caputo was on duty dressed up as a woman. What did you just ask? Have you any peculiar tendencies? Me, peculiar tendencies? What tendencies? No, at least he doesn't admit to any. Alright, yes, goodbye. Captain, it's nothing more than jealousy. She torments me with her jealousy. She puts me through hell. Caputo, when she's jealous again, and calls me, you're fired. Speaking of getting axed, Captain, I hear the Commissioner wants to give you a pink slip. Right? What do you care about it? What do you mean do I care? I've been attached to you for years, I'm part of your furniture, and you're like a brother. Now Caputo, I don't want to be light. You're deaf and you're dumb, and to me, that's the only thing that matters. Alright, so I'm deaf and dumb, so tell me what's on your mind? Now that Pastrone's dead, one of these boys must know who the spy in the police is. And I'm going to try finding out from this one here. [Caputo] Ah, another gentleman. How many times I gotta tell you, yeah. Of course. (wincing) [Radio Lady] And now we continue our program of easy listening music. (easy listening music) Hang up, Cupid. And call your lawyer, because this time nobody's gonna get you out of a 30 year rap. But what'd I do, Captain? What the hell is up? What did you do? I'll tell you what you did. You knocked off Pastrone to take his place in the organization. Why don't you admit it? You're crazy. I don't know nothing about it. Those marks on your face... Didn't they come from Pastrone before he died? Pastrone's got nothing to do with them. Then who gave you those bruises? Barella. Frank Barella. Frank Barella. Why? Because he wanted to know Pastrone's cop. Barella's got a shipment he wants to put through and he needs his help. And what did you tell him? That I don't know his name. I don't know nothing. You don't know nothing, eh? Nothing, eh? The motive's there, and I've got the proof, so I'm arresting you for murder in the first degree. Now let's walk. Hey, wait, hold it. There's only one other guy that knows his name. The big boss in the Orient. And you're going to put me in touch with him, aren't you? I don't know his name, either. You don't know it? Honest! Now talk. I only know some guys from Bangkok. You know how these things are. We just take orders. And you told Barella, didn't you? I had to. And you told him where he could find your guys in Bangkok. He was going to kill me, I tell you! Too bad. Too bad for you. If Barella spills this, tell him Ferramenti's finished. He'll be killed. But I'm gonna help you, okay? I'll get rid of Barella, and you'll do me a little favor. A phone call. After you make that call, you're deaf and dumb, eh? Otherwise I'll tear you apart! Alright, gypsy, am I getting married or not? I'm sorry, I can't read your hand. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. Now don't ask me anything else. You're supposed to tell me my future! That's against the law, Sergeant. Ah, the law. The trip's coming along, as you read right here. I told you that I read it, and now you see I'm right! Does this mean you're going somewhere? Yeah. They say we're incompetents. Me too? Are you on my side or not? I'm with you. Then you're incompetent as well. Ah. In order to find this police department spy, I'm going to have to take a long voyage. You mean he just left? Yes. He just ignored my direct order that he was to stay here in Naples. Instead, he's even left the country. Where'd he go? I have no idea. But obviously, he's on the run, and that means one thing, he's our traitor! We'd better notify Interpol. No, no, no, wait a second, just wait. Let's not be impulsive. After all, you're the one who told me just how impulsive Rizzo can be. No, let's just, let's- He might be onto something, and who knows, he might bring us back a little surprise. But don't you understand? He felt the earth getting hot underneath his feet. To me, his running away is a clear indication that the man is guilty. My advice is to take it slowly. We're in no hurry. If we give him enough rope, maybe he'll hang himself. Or somebody else. (world music) Go to the Thai village. Aah! This happens to belong to me. What did you say just now? The wallet's mine. You mean you're Italian? And you're from Naples, huh? No, Pozzuoli. And what are you up to? I follow the tourists. You'd be surprised how good the pickings are in this place. In Naples, there wasn't much going on. So you're here to keep up Italy's reputation, is that it? But I'm not Italian. My name is Viktor Petica. Also, I'm known as Goldenhands. I'm stateless. A man without a country? A man without a country. And you've got to be a tourist. No. What are you, then? A captain of police. Oh, wow. I've really had it. Captain, there's police. Yeah. They might think I'm a thief, or whatever. Or whatever, eh? Let's pretend we're tourists. What's the time? What? I just asked you for the time. In Brazil or Bangkok? In Bangkok. The time in Bangkok is half past 10. I'm going to the Thai village, you know the way? Oh sure, Captain. I'll take you up the street of the temples. The street of the temples? The street of the temples there. Captain, the tickets. Tickets? How much? A hundred baht. Thank you. This is the monk's court. The kind that sets fire to themselves. There, see? I have to thank you, Captain. If you turned me in, you would have caused the end of quite a brilliant career. Sure. I am not a bragger, you know, but I'm one of the last of a disappearing trade. I hope so. Who knows how to steal with finesse these days? Did you see how easily I lifted your wallet? No. You must have noticed it, you understand business, more or less. Goldenhands, any idiot would have noticed it. They would've, eh? Yeah. Postcards? Postcards! Buy some postcards, sir? No thank you. Postcards? Captain, they get offended very easily here, you better take one. They get offended? So how much? 20 baht. Goldenhands... Huh? You owe me 120 baht. Oh? What do you mean? Well, the temple street, 100, plus 20 more with this lousy photography, and if you don't give it to me, I'll get offended. Come on. Okay, now get me a taxi, because I've got to go find the Thai village. Oh, Captain, now I'm going to be offended. Allow me to give you a lift in my car. It's parked over there. (car backfiring) Here we are, we can get out here. We've arrived. You'll notice, Captain, I'm not bragging, but I always use Italian cars. Hot cars? Captain, really, I swear I bought this baby by the sweat of my brow. I'm sorry, but I can't go any further than here. That's alright. This isn't my part of town, Captain. Whatever you need, be sure to give me a call. I'm at your disposal. Guns, murder, pickpocketing, be sure to call me. I'm not bragging, but I know this town like I know Naples. I'll be glad to help out. Here's my card, just call me at the office. Thanks, Goldenhands, take it easy. Sabaidee. (festive Thai music) I am happy to meet you. We are glad you came. You have been expected. Friends of mine are here too. You must not be offended that their guns are aimed at you. Be careful if you wish to live a long time in this sweet world. You see, you will die instantly should I drop this flowering branch. Shall we go? I hope that your visit will be a pleasant one. Sabaidee. Follow us, please. (speaking foreign language) It is interesting. I have always preferred Thai boxing to your western style. Now, please come this way. Our friend in Naples, Ferramenti, informed us you'd be arriving. You are welcome here. Our custom is not to arrange such meetings on the telephone. And none of us has met you before. Yes, I know, but this is an emergency, and we can't stick to custom. Besides, Ferramenti surely gave you some assurance concerning me, didn't he? There isn't much time, so listen to me carefully. I succeeded Pastrone, and I intend to resume every one of his contacts as soon as possible. I want to know that you're able to continue supplying me and go over the smallest detail. [All] We are interested in making a sale. And I am interested in buying. So, show it to me. I've got to inspect the stuff before I buy it. I don't buy until I look it over, and there are lots of other suppliers, so goodbye. Just a moment. What are you trying to pull? You couldn't even sell that stuff as bicarbonate of soda! Wait. I'm sorry, we're to put you to a test. We have other merchandise. Excellent merchandise. But I'm afraid there's a problem. What is the problem? I've got to know who the cop is that's undertaken Naples. I know your boss knows who the man is. I want you to put me in touch with him. How can I make it clearer? When somebody bumped off Pastrone, the cops started breathing down our necks. I've got to know who that cop is if we're to stay in business. It's in your interests. The competition's growing every day. That's why I had Ferramenti warn you about Barella's arrival. And he's more dangerous than anybody. I do not think he will give us any more trouble. Please. This should be a lesson not to cross the organization. Listen, I- - Bangkok is just a shipping point. Our merchandise doesn't originate from here, it's sent on. We are agents. It comes to Bangkok from headquarters. Where's headquarters? In Hong Kong, and we can reach it only by indirect contact. To reach it, you must ask for Bambu Kane, in Aberdeen, in a place called Golden Moon. You assholes! He's a cop! You've really got an imagination. Honorable friend... Kindly pardon us if we look into words spoken by our enemy. Mmm. (banging gong) (phone ringing) I'm Goldenhands, import, export. My friend, listen carefully and do me a favor right away. Call the police. My telephone number... 218463. Get them over here as soon as possible. You haven't told me the address! I don't know it, stupid, that's the reason I gave you the number! Oh yeah. (speaking foreign language) (woman talking on intercom) (speaking foreign language) (alarms ringing) (speaking foreign language) (adventurous world music) (chips clattering) Good morning. I would like to speak to Bambu Kane. We don't know Bambu Kane. Pardon me, but isn't this the Golden Moon? Yes. Then I'd like to speak to Bambu Kane. No Bambu Kane. Alright. Stop. Looking for someone? Good morning. My name is Chang Li. I know you are looking for someone. Some friends of mine in Bangkok told me to go to the Golden Moon and look for someone called Bambu Kane. Know him? Go tonight to the Green Dragon. Green Dragon? Mmm. (upbeat club music) Fancy seeing you in the area! What are you doing in this part of the world? We're having the Orient. The whole fleet just packed with chicks. And the girls in Naples will get a little rest. (laughing) Hey, Flat. When are we gonna have another free fall like the last time? Soon, very soon. Let's go. Okay. Okay ladies. See you in a little while. Have a seat. Come on now, you don't want to start any trouble here, do you? I want to know how you managed to escape from Bangkok. Ah. Well you see, you use your hands. I use money. Now listen to me, you clod. Take it easy. We're not in Naples. Excuse me, sir. Bambu Kane is waiting for you backstage. Nice. Excuse me, eh? Alright. Look out! Thanks, Rizzo. See, even cops can be use for some things. Where are we going? Somebody in Bangkok must have warned them. Now let's try to phone Bangkok and find out. There doesn't seem to be any way out of here. There's no end to these Chinese. There's millions. Now, you start talking. Where's Bambu Kane? Tell me or I'm gonna kill you! Talk! Now, where's Bambu Kane? (speaking foreign language) How am I gonna tell her to shut up in Chinese? Shhh! You've got to tell me how you managed to be a gangster. There we are. From now on, every step you take, I'm going to take. And where are we going? On a sightseeing tour? Or maybe you'd like to go to a good restaurant. Don't try to be cute. You know how to get to Bambu Kane. You've just been told. I don't know where he is, so I'm going with you. You're telling me. Oh no, I'm not telling you. You're the one telling me. I don't have to tell you anything. Don't worry, I've got plenty of time to waste. In fact, time doesn't mean anything to me. You want to go to a restaurant, okay- - Okay. We'll make a deal. We work together. I'll help you find your crooked cop, you help me get a shipment of drugs through to Naples. Once it's through, you get your bad cop. Huh? I might. Okay. Okay. Now take off this wedding band, Captain, eh? Wait a minute. First you tell me where we're headed. Okay. Bambu Kane is a woman. A Japanese. Her real names is Makiko. She lives in a villa on a beach in Hong Kong. (speaking foreign language) Are you Makiko? They were afraid she'd talk. That's why they stabbed her. Who did this to you? The name, Makiko. Leave her alone, can't you see she's going to die? Who was it. I want the name. Yoko... Yoko... Yamada... Let's go. All we need's a corpse on our hands. Come on. Let's go up there and try to find this Yoko Yamada. But the police are going to be here any minute. What are you doing? Looking, looking. I know that, looking for what? We've got to find something that'll lead us to Yoko Yamada. Mama. Mama. Mama. Yoko? Mama. Are you Yoko? Here it is. This is the first thing, this is Yoko. That's Yoko, huh? So what? Yamada? Yamada. Yamada. Look, we'll leave him here. The police will take care of him. No, he's going with us. He's our only lead to find out who Yamada is. You're crazy. You come to Mama Makiko with me? Good. Alright, Yoko. Who's Yamada? Yamada. (giggling) What's funny? (all sighing) Now listen to me. Is Yamada a dancer? No. A boxer? Is Yamada a woman? You know, a woman? Aha. She's a woman. And pregnant. Is she? Well, you mean that she's pregnant... A pregnant woman. The woman dances with her legs spread. Alright, she dances with her legs spread apart. Bravo, Yoko. I knew you'd be able to tell me who it was. What'd he tell you? You stay and play with Yoko. I'm going to Yamada. Hey. What about our deal? Don't you know that between gangsters, there's no such thing? (speaking foreign language) You be good, I'll be right back. (applause) (speaking foreign language) Yamada! (applause) (speaking foreign language) You Yamada? Yes. Are you crazy? Come on, get a woman! Alright, that's enough! I was too late to save her. She'd been stabbed by the time I got there! Makiko spoke your name before she was killed, but I didn't know who you were. You understand what I'm saying? Mmm. Good. You police? Yes. Makiko was my friend. The person she was with were no good, they blackmailed her. She was afraid to leave them, because they would hurt her son. Where's Yoko now? He's with me. There is danger to child now. They know he may lead you to them without meaning to. I have to avenge Makiko's death, and I know- (glass shattering) You wanted to lose me, huh? Then you shouldn't have asked for the address in front of the hotel. And keep the change. Hey, where you going? Hyatt Hotel. What happened? They murdered Yamada. Did you find anything out? Yeah. That the poor little boy's in danger, and you left him alone back at the hotel, you jerk. Yoko. Yoko! I told you not to leave him alone for a minute. Look, I didn't come to Hong Kong to babysit. Look out! Dadadadadada! What's this bububububub, Yoko, why do you always have to play? Hey, where are you going? Well, it's like you said, Captain Rizzo... I mean, a big gangster like me? I should never trust a cop. So from now on, the two of us will be on our own. You see, you made him good and mad. Bravo. (giggling) You laugh? What are you laughing at? Now how are we going to solve this problem? Well, I'll tell you, even if you aren't able to understand. I'll have to leave you with someone I can trust. There's an ill wind blowing here, right? There's going to be trouble. You're tired already, eh? You're light as a feather and you're tired. Look at me. Huh, cat got your tongue? Little boys always talk a lot, especially when they're Japanese. Come. Let's go. You hungry? Okay. I think you've got some Neapolitan ancestors, the way you talk with your hands. Let me pay. Let's go. Hey look, it's Flatfoot! Hey, my man! Hi! Hello. How you doing? You disappeared from the Green Dragon. We took more of a beating than we took at Pearl Harbor! So where we going now? We're ready when you are! No, I've had more than enough. I wanted to see you for a better reason. Meet Yoko. He needs your help. This bambino's in danger of getting himself killed in Hong Kong. I've got to leave him with guys that can be trusted, and around here, I can only trust you three. Well, okay. Okay. Yoko, go with these men, you'll have a good time, like with me. If you had a good time with me. So long. Thanks again. See you, man. Hey, what's going on, huh? Come on, you've got to start acting like a man. Quit being so sentimental, you're breaking my heart. Yoko, it's best you stay here. These men are friends of mine. You'll have fun, I know. And you've got to be brave. Alright? That's it, that's much better. He's all yours. This is the new captain of our exalted ship. Boy. He's our new mascot. Joe... He runs on milk, not whisky, remember that. So long. So long. See you around, Flat. Thanks. Saint Gennaro, you're helping once again. (speaking foreign language) Don't worry, we'll get there before them. You ever been to Macau? No. Macau's a Portuguese colony. She's completely surrounded these days. You know, Red China. Those islands over there all belong to Mao. Very new to Macau sightseeing? A gambler. On business? Yeah, mine. Would you like to follow us, please? (speaking foreign language) We're the Portuguese police. I'm placing you under arrest. From the reports I received, your comportment has been absolutely unbelievable. You are accused of outrage and assault on public officials. As I am, too, a public official, I'm going to make the same charges against your men. We are not joking, Captain Rizzo. You didn't even give my men time to show their identity. Enter! This time, old friend, you came in second. Don't worry about it. I'll leave sooner. Gentlemen, now listen up. The charges you face are most serious. Trafficking in drugs, and involvement in homicide. Who says so? I do. I came to get you, and I find you with him? You're obviously working together. Now I've tried to be fair with you. I'm sorry, but this time the evidence is too overwhelming. First you knock off Pastrone to take over the operation in Naples, then on the pretext of looking for the black sheep, you come over here and make your deal with the big bosses. Put them both on the next plane for Italy. With Captain Rizzo, there won't be any problem. He'll get extradited to his own country. But Barella's a citizen of the States, and we can't send him to Italy. And there's still a further complication, he's an undesirable in the United States. I need them both, now. Well, I do not write the extradition treaties. Okay, okay, just make sure Rizzo is on the next plane to Italy. Alright. Rizzo, I now place you under arrest. I hoped until the end that you were not implicated. You'd better hire a good lawyer. Come on, Gennarino, hurry up. Do I have to clean over there too? Actually, you have to sweep the whole corridor. Get moving, you spend all your time asleep! Good, I'm asleep now! (swift knocking) Who is it? Gennarino, what are you doing here? Well, Captain, what can I say? When I don't have your protection, they throw me in jail at the drop of a hat for nothing, so what am I doing here? Right now it suits me fine. I do a little nursing, and I sweep up ideally. And I help the sick some of the time. If you need anything, I can arrange to get you whatever you want. I know everybody here. Listen to me, Gennarino. Does the mail work? Am I able to get a letter out of here? A letter. Of course we're able to send certified mail, parcel, post, air mail, registered mail, special delivery. Couldn't be easier, but... Easier letter very important? Most important. No problem, because it seems so important, I shall mail it from the Vatican. Go ahead, you're next. Now make the sign of the cross. Hey, and Gensino... Yes, father. Gansino, I'm giving you absolution this time, but next time, I won't, because you don't tell me the whole truth. Alright. But Father, I only talk in the presence of my lawyer. I believe that. You can go now, and God bless you God's blessing. Hey! You come here again? I heard your confession yesterday. Yes, but I sinned again. Your promises aren't worth my time... I tried my best, but I'm a very bad man. I'll hear you again. Blessed are the weak. Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Gennarino, tell me your sin. Gennarino? Huh? Tell me your sin! I'm trying to remember. What are you doing, you kneel down on one side and you're speaking from another! I'm left handed! God give me patience. Alright. Confess your sins. (whispering) You see, you're weak. I have so many. You've got to hide temptations. Sorry, very sorry. Here, here, your holy hat. Oh, it's perfectly alright. At least I've still got my- - You alright? Thank you. God bless you. [Rizzo's Voice] Dear Caputo, don't worry about me being in jail. Remember, I've still got an ace up my sleeve. Now, instead of sitting there with nothing to do, I have a little job I want you to do for me. But first of all, get your feet off my desk! Go to the Hotel Excelsior. Without being seen, go to the room where Frank Barella stayed, and search it. I'm sure his papers with certain information are still there. [Passerby] Did you hear? They've shot Sergeant Caputo in the Excelsior Hotel! He's in serious condition, I said! Hey guard! Guard! I've got to talk to Commissioner Morabito right away! Your friend Barella was released by the Macau Police, and he was brought under heavy guard back here to Naples. The results can be seen immediately. Caputo was badly wounded, and I know that it was your organization. Please, Commissioner, let me go out. You've got to be crazy. I'm the only one who can find Barella! I'll find him, not you. Is there something else you'd like to tell me? Unfortunately, there is! I need some time, Commissioner. (knocking) No, no, no! I'll do anything for you, Captain, I'll do anything you want! Don't worry, I'll go easy. Just remember that you never saw a thing! [Guard] Easier, Captain, easier than that! Easy, you said! (speaking foreign language) Joe, did you sound the alarm? Look, it's Captain Rizzo, we've got to use earplugs. Gennarino, I need two epileptics. Two epileptics! Get going! Oh, I get it! Yes, I understand! Come here, all you men! Listen to me! Open the gate. This is Dr. Calusi, there'll be an ambulance on its way out. (siren wailing) Fortunately the bullet didn't hit any of his vital organs, so don't worry, he'll make it. Look, I know he's in Naples, and I don't care what you have to do, you've got to find him! (phone ringing) Hello. This is Captain Rizzo. Where the hell are you? Don't worry about that, just forget the past and listen to me, because I badly need your help. I figure Barella knows the answer now, he knows who's a police spy. Then tell the Commissioner. Me? No, all I know is that it was Barella who shot Caputo. I want you to go after him, but you've got to take him alive. That's the only way that I'll be able to get out of this jam. And I know where you can locate him. 20 Via del Piccolo, a chair on the first floor. How do you know where Barella is when we've been chasing his ass for 10 hours? Look, just go there and pick him up. Curiosity killed my friends. You wouldn't shoot me, Frank. You've had too many chances to shoot me before. And besides, it's always been easy for you to get away from the police. Ever since Bangkok, I've known you were with the FBI. You're right. My compliments, Rizzo. Didn't take you too long to figure that out. You know, I knew you weren't the black sheep when we were arrested together. And now you know who he is. I think so. But I can't prove it yet. It won't be long before we can prove it. To the headquarters, this is Morabito. You're to stand by until this channel stays clear. Rizzo is on the loose, he's escaped, and let all cars that the order is out for his arrest. If he's sighted, he's to be arrested immediately. Watches, Swiss watches! Watches, watches! Swiss watches, unbelievable prices! That file you kept on me. You should never have kept it in a hotel room. I thought the FBI trained their men better than that. Maybe you're not very good at what you do. Good enough to know you were the ideal choice for the organization. By being a narcotics agent, you knew every move the police made. The proof was in Macau. I mean, how could you be there the moment we were arrested? Nobody but the organization knew that Rizzo and I were there. Ah. The crooked cop everybody's looking for is you, Accardo. Too bad you won't be able to share that information with anybody. Now wait... I'll send you where I sent Caputo. The two of you can talk about it, okay? Aw, you broke the door. You're supposed to knock before you come in! Don't just stand there, God damnit! Come on, get going! Come on- - Momma mia, please don't hurt him! Why are you men standing around? Help him! Arrest him! Rizzo must be crazy! Arrest Rizzo! Get Rizzo. Accardo. We're awfully sorry. I promise you that the Captain will get the punishment he deserves. I personally- - Oh, no you don't. Sorry, Captain, but I've got to put these on. Oh, good, just what I needed. Now you're gonna tell me you knew all along this was the black sheep, eh? Don't worry, Commissioner. We won't say anything to Washington. [Intercom] A brilliant anti-drug operation was brought to a conclusion by Commissioner Morabito of Naples. The young commissioner has broken an international organization of dealers which was masterminded by an agent of the United States narcotics bureau, Sam Accardo. For several months, Commissioner Morabito secretly monitored all movements of the members of the drug ring. Thanks to the genius but dangerous restrictions that the police commissioner imposed on his men, the Italian police were able to deliver a crushing blow to organized crime. A personal telegram of congratulations for a job well done was sent by the Minister of the Interior to Commissioner Morabito. This concludes today's newscast. That the way it goes here in Italy? No, it can be much worse than that. Well, they won't be giving me any medals when I get back to the States. It's true. You know you can make more money being a wiseguy than a cop? Uh... Is the Italian government gonna contribute any money to take care of him? (giggling) Laugh, that's all you care about, isn't it? I'm the only one things happen to this way. The American Navy decided they didn't want him because he's too small. Five's too young. Either I make an adoption, or he'll be sent to an orphanage in Tokyo. What would you decide in my place? Well, my friend, if I were in your place, I'd keep the boy. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Bravo. Yoko, eat properly, and make me happy. You're eating that spaghetti like a pig. Do me a favor, can't you? Now what are you up to?
