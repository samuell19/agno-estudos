I eat ground rice without salt. I feel much better. There are people who talk about that, Brazilians. Have you been to Brazil? No. I just go to talks. Macrobiotics is a Japanese thing. A Japanese man imported it. It consists of finding your equilibrium through food. Each one of us has an equilibrium point. We have to find the most economical way for the organism to achieve its equilibrium. It's expensive. The Japanese began with their own food, soya, all of that stuff. Bringing it here is expensive. - Soya? - Not just soya. In Brazil, survival itself is at stake. So this Brazilian school calls into question some of the Japanese school’s principles. There's this thing here, this circle with a wavy line and two dots. What is it called? The circle, there, you see it? With a wavy line and two dots, like that, one there and then the other? - Yin and yang. - That's it. Yin and yang. I have too much yang. and not enough yin. I need to get more yin. I have to find my yin. My husband is the opposite. He is supple. I'm hard, very hard. - My husband has too much yin. - Really? It’s just that this search for balance, is a bit idealistic. That's what the Brazilians are questioning. They say that imbalance is part of life. That it's not balance you should search for, because... in a sense, balance is death. You need movement. Because imbalance, is dynamic. It’s life. If you’ll allow me to ask the question, how did you come across these ideas? For a long time, I wasn't very well. I was in analysis, and then well... It was my mother mainly. She was ill, very ill. She didn't want to have the operation. She was too tired. She thought that if they operated on her, she would die. We had to find something else. That's why she started treating herself, with food. And she got better. Well... Not better exactly, but, well... But what exactly was wrong with her? Cancer too comes from an imbalance. The imbalance is too great, and it creates a tumour. Then again, cancer can have all kinds of causes. If you smoke, I’m sure there would be an imbalance, but if it comes from accidental irradiation or a virus... Irradiation, a virus, that also creates an imbalance that needs to be controlled. That's the important thing. Especially in Brazil, in those countries. But us too. Even if we have it all - and less life as a result. Less life than in those countries that... that have a future, that are coming into being. We have to try to get by. OK. If you change your mind, don't hesitate to call me. - I am at your disposal. - Thank you. And you, if you have a food-related problem, you can call me too. Thank you. Goodbye. - For both coffees. - Thank you, sir. Pathetic, isn't it? I don't think so. Do you believe all that stuff, about yin and yang? That's not the point. She wants to do something. Something to escape the inevitable. - And you think that... - You listened to her ironically. You thought you were superior. You were condescending. - I don't think so. - You were. At one point, you could see that I was listening, and you played up to me, against her. Really? Is that what you thought? Well, wasn't it? I don't know. Maybe unconsciously. She was trying to tell you things. Important things. Hang on, are you lecturing me now? You asked my opinion, I’m giving it to you. It doesn't make sense. For once it's not me talking, I listen, and I get told off. Well, maybe I was being a bit ironic. I’m like that, I can’t help it, it's a form of defence. After all, she was attacking me. She was being aggressive towards me, in all that she said. I didn't notice. She’s leaving the job she used to do with me. She's leaving me. Everything she told me was a way to make me understand that I'm not up to it. Not as a teacher, but... in terms of the demands, the requirements of life. In fact, she was the one playing the superiority card. She told me indirectly that she finds me dead and lifeless. All that talk about people in the Third World more alive than us… I mean... Why not? But how can you make such generalisations? It’s terrible isn't it? I don't think so. But she's a bit crazy, isn’t she, this girl? She believes she has a mission. I thought you were less cynical. So you know me, do you? - I have to go. - No, wait. No, really. I have to go. - Are you a student? - At Paris X university. I gave a talk on your book, the latest, Cristal. Is that so? I really like that book. It's excellent, I think. It caused me enough pain, in any case. It's your anger that I love. I sent you a copy of my presentation 4, 5 months ago, along with a letter. You never answered me. Ah, I'm very careless with my mail. I never reply. She's right, that girl. Everything happens to you, you have it all, but you do nothing. And that, that's death. Goodbye. Wait! At least tell me your name, that way if I find your presentation... It's not worth it. Yes, it is. I keep everything, you know. Aurore. Aurore Tremaine. Tremaine? Pretty name. Goodbye, Aurore. Goodbye. Any calls for me? There was a Thomas who called twice. Still no letter from Bergère? Two months since I sent him my book, and at his request... It's becoming insulting frankly. What do I do? Should I call him? Do nothing. - We got the tickets. - Which tickets? Louise. Ah shit, Louise. - And when is it? - Saturday. Oh no, not Saturday. The final’s then. Well, it’s the last show. She won't be happy. Be nice. Nice? I am nice. Everybody spits in my face. This morning again, I was insulted by two stupid cows. What did Thomas want? - He was waiting for you. - He was waiting for me? Yes, you had an appointment. You should have known. Ah, well, I forgot. If it's him, I absolutely don't want to talk to him. Yes, hello? Yes, Thomas. No. Well... I don't really know. Maybe he can come tomorrow? Yes? Morning? Huh? Morning? Yes? Ten o'clock? All right. Goodbye. Yes, you're going. In any case, it's a good thing, because I think I'm sick. - What was it with those girls? - Huh? No, I was asking about the girls who insulted you. You’re the one for whom I have made the most effort to meet, the person I most wanted to see. And you remained invisible, someone one hears about, but never sees. There was a time, Madam, when I was indeed visible... When there weren’t many women like me. Are we disturbing? - Good evening. - Good evening. - It was really good. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Well done. - Ah, yes, it was really, really good. Thank you. This is Ana Paula. She's the one following my diet. Aliette... Abel Vichac. You drink a lot of coffee, don't you? Lots of tea? Can you tell? A lack of magnesium. A lack of vitamin C, of vitamin B. Did you know that coffee kills vitamin B? No, I didn't know. All vitamins: B, B1, B6, B12... Very important vitamins. And champagne isn’t too harmful? Ah, I’m sorry. Let me serve you. - Here you go. Would you like some? - No, thank you. Congratulations again. Well done again. Really, it was... - Would you like to sit down? - No, we're not staying. I know a pharmacist, on rue Saint-Lazare. You have to go and see him. He’s extraordinary. 93, rue Saint-Lazare. Mr. Simon. He heals people. He looked at me and said: You, you need five grams. of vitamin C. Not one, not two, But five! Five grams. No, honestly, all that stuff, I find it... Oh, but this chap, he isn’t just playing around. He tells you right away: That’s shit. It's useless. I have a friend, he saved her. She was only eating rice. Ground rice. She would have died. Ground rice? Florence Grinberg? You know her? Yes. That's Yin-Yang. She’s a former student. He saved her. Go and see him. What sign are you? - Capricorn? Aquarius? - Aquarius, yes. I’m Pisces. Liz Taylor. Pisces! Let me remind you what that meant. What's unique about the wife-mother position is that it naturally connects her to pleasure. That’s the first aspect, which is at first glance the easiest to understand. In any case, the surface element, can be easily understood. The second, more difficult aspect to understand, you have to remember, in order to understand what is written on the previous page, about parent-child relationships. To put it simply, children equal death for their parents, like supermarkets are the death of small business. So the singularity which is played out in nuptiality, is knotted in nuptiality, but unravels in the child. Now the child... is the disappearance... Hi. Now, the child, is the very disappearance of this unique conjunction. So the singularity of the mother-wife is the event in which one witnesses one’s own disappearance. Henri, it's me. Will you call me? Any time is fine. I need to see you tomorrow. It’s important. Call me back. I not only found your address, I found your presentation, and I wanted to talk to you about it. Am I disturbing you? It's not that, it's... I can come back. No, come in. - Catherine. We share this flat. - Hello. It's pretty, it's pleasant. It's a little small and... We’re starting to hate each other. - What is that? It's beautiful. - I am at the Boulle arts school. I do design for a jewellery line. Are you leaving? I would have liked to stay. - You want to talk to her about her presentation, right? - Yes. I would have been interested, I used to study philosophy. I’ve read all your books. And you gave up? Why was that? For the money. When Henri calls, tell him eight o'clock at the Rostand, tomorrow. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'll be back late. I'm having dinner with my Chinese friend. What can I get you? I have green tea. Green tea from Japan, have you tried it? No, but okay. Excuse me, before... Where is it? It’s there. Thank you. It's dumb of me, I brought tarts. - Where is the great man? - How do you know he’s here? I just saw Aurore. Careful - I'm Aurore. - Frankly, that pisses me off. - I won't insist. OK, OK, I'll stay. Where are you going? I know someone who’ll find this amusing. My friend Bruno has just arrived. He brought this. - I'll leave you to it. - No, no. Please. Does he often spoil you like that, your friend Bruno? Sometimes. Fruit, chocolates, wine. - But I... - He’s well brought up. Not me, I always come empty-handed. You brought yourself, that's all we ask of you. Two lemon, two raspberry, like in the ad. - Which ad? - I don't remember. But in your opinion, which would your friend prefer? Lemon or raspberry? Raspberry. - How well do you know him? - Quite well. Let's make a bet. I reckon he'll choose lemon. Obviously, if we both choose raspberry, he won't have a choice. No, but you’ll let him choose. I say he’ll choose raspberry. All right, let’s make a bet. What do we bet? How about a kiss? I'm kidding, I don't know. OK, fine. A kiss if I win. And if you lose? Ah, but I will win. In the drawer, there are spoons and... in the cupboard there are cups with saucers. - Hello. - I've seen you somewhere. Ah, at Jussieu maybe. I’m on the opposite side, science, I belong to a research group. What are you researching? We are working on violations of Bell's inequality, Aspect's experiment, questions about the indiscernible. It’s quantum mechanics, It might not mean much to you. Bell’s inequality… isn’t that related to Einstein's locality principle? You’ve heard of it? I must have read about it at the hairdresser's, yes. No, I sort of vaguely know that wave packets... maintain relationships even at considerable distances. It’s something like that, right? Yes, that's right, except that it's not vague at all. When there are two particles, it can be formalized in a six- dimensional mathematical space, it's what we call the configuration space. Who cares? Pass me your cup. You didn't tell me what you’re working on. Something far more vast. Let's say the notion of happiness and regret. - Regret? - Help yourself. Yes, regret, remorse, repentance, nostalgia, mourning, synderesis, things like that. - It's not very funny, all that. - No. I'm not a very funny person, Which I regret, by the way. - You regret it? - Precisely. What's your angle on regret? - Logical. - For example? Ah no, it must be very boring for you, all that. No, I'm interested. Logic interests me. - You chose a lemon tart. - Yes. Because you are a delicate young man. Thank you, but I don't see the connection. I chose first. I chose raspberry. Let’s suppose you too wanted raspberry. You had to choose lemon to leave a choice between lemon and raspberry. So I should regret my choice? Not necessarily. So? So, so... It’s a bad example. I also chose lemon before Bruno had his. I saw. So that you could change your mind if you felt like it. That’s sweet. So you prefer raspberry too. I don't regret it. - So... - What's up? You both prefer raspberry and you both chose lemon. That's funny. It makes sense: if Catherine takes lemon to allow me to swap, I’m obliged not to swap In order to enable her to swap in turn. That's right, and the same for her, vice versa. - That’s what you call a circle. - Or a garrot. Or a headache. There’s one left. Go ahead, Catherine. Catherine? Did I say Catherine? I meant Aurore. Why don't you tell him the truth? Bastard. Catherine, Aurore, what's the big deal? You're going to regret it, Bruno. Regret what? It’s grotesque. Can't you see that you're trapping yourself? I think you have work to do, Bruno. I think you should go. Can't you see I'm doing you a favour? I don't give a shit. Get out. Poor girl. Hang on. Explain it to me. What's the problem? There’s nothing to explain. No, it's just that I have work to do. And you're going to spend the rest of your life being called Aurore. Well done. What's going on? Is it because Aurore... My name isn’t Aurore. My name is Catherine. - Really? What's the big deal? - Yes. What's the big deal? Your name is Catherine. - Catherine Trémaine? - Catherine Rateau. You didn't need to to conceal your identity. Why didn't you tell me right away? Aurore is pretty, but Catherine is a nice name too. It's all just childish games. Your name is Catherine. And my name is still Abel, a ridiculous name. It isn’t at all ridiculous. My mother says it is. She wanted to call me Guillaume, but... it was just after the war, and my grandmother thought that it would sound Prussian. So, you see, I know all about the little dramas of names. - Does she still mention it to you? - Who? Your mother. I don't see her very often. She lives in the outer suburbs, in Plaisir. I never have time to go there. I only see my mother once a year, on her birthday. She lives in Stains. Have you ever been to Stains in March, when the pissers are in bloom? No. What's a pisser? A prunus tree. That’s what we call them in the north. - What? - You’ve never seen a prunus? They have purple-red leaves, and a brown-ish tinge. - Plum. - Well, yes, as the name suggests. No, I've never seen one. Well, maybe I have, but since I didn't know the name, it's as if I'd never seen one. So, you were born in the north? Yes. And you? You never left Paris? I have done once or twice. Would you like some more tea? And your friend Bruno... He must hate me now. He hated you before. Yes, I noticed that. Are you together? Are you interested? - Am I being indiscreet? - No. - Is he in love with you? - No. Yes, he is. What about you? Are you in love with him? You are being indiscreet. No doubt. Stop looking at me like that. It's your eyebrows. - What's wrong with my eyebrows? - They’re very thick. - And? - I like them. Stop looking at my eyebrows. It bothers me. Look at my eyes. - I'll add some hot water. - Stay here. Is this where you sleep? Yes. Aurore sleeps over there, in the back. Aurore... Aurore Trémaine, that is? Yes, that's her. - Do you regret it? - Regret what? Yeah, it's Henri. Are you there? You aren’t there? OK, Aurore, call me back later, yes? These slippers were on sale. I got them half price. - Nice. - Why do you say nice all the time? Don't you want to sit next to me? I have to get back. Of course. Why of course? - In any case, it wasn't... - Not at all... - I don't want to... And I know that you... that you’re married. I’m not married. You live with someone. I don't know if you’d call it living. That's a horrible thing to say. Yes, I agree. But you love her. - I'll get going. - OK. See me out. Don't be angry. I'm not angry. Can we see each other again? Yes, I hope so. - There you go. - Thank you. - I forgot to tell you about your presentation. – So you did. What can I say about it, in a few words? It's very intelligent, very reasoned. Very cold, too. It's not like you at all. Since I’m very silly, very passionate, very hot. I'm the one who's really... You didn't write it, of course, that presentation. - No, since I’m not Aurore. - No, but I understood. You took your time. Yes, it takes time sometimes. In logic, there are three steps... Great, but you're not going to give me a lesson now are you. No, I’m not. Aren't you forgetting something? What am I forgetting? Well, we made a bet, and you won. Don't feel obliged. No, but... I suggested the bet, didn't I? - Yes, but I'm the one who... - Look... OK, that’s that. You’ll catch a cold. You’re not my mother. I'm not. - OK, well... - Goodbye. See you soon, Catherine. Pretty name, Catherine. See you soon. Aliette? Ah, you’ve already had dinner? You could have waited for me. I was waiting for you, then I stopped waiting. - And Denis the cat, where is he? - I don't know. Was it good? Was what good? Your afternoon. It was nice. Who was it with? What do you mean, who with? Which one of the two? Yin-Yang or the other one? Well, I was with the other one. I needed to talk to her about the work she did on my book. And you stayed there until now? No, I didn't stay there until now. I went to the Chai, I didn't see anyone, I drank three glasses of white. I can smell them from here. And did you have another meeting there? No, I didn't have another appointment, I was... I needed to rinse out my stomach. She made this weird tea, a Japanese green tea. Here, remind me to say no to that conference in Japan. I'm sure Yin-Yang drinks it. Do they know each other? No, I was just saying. Did you make love? Excuse me? No, nothing. Yes, you said something. Say it again. I said: aside from the green tea, did you make love? - Aside from the green tea, no. - She must be wild. Listen, Aliette, leave it. For the umpteenth time, I don't want that. I don't want those kinds of relationship. What kinds? Seedy complicity. I’m not chasing that girl. I simply agreed to have some tea with her. With tarts, yes. Lemon and raspberry tarts, since you want to know everything. Absolutely. A friend of hers was there. It really wasn’t a big deal. Oh! Oops. So... What are you trying to prove? Is it used? You should see yourself. It’s anger, I really find your... your curiosity, I find it unhealthy frankly. Ask yourself whose fault that is. Before I met you, I was the simplest girl in the world. I gave up a lot of things because I thought we’d be something. Or if not, that we’d at least be a couple. And you know what the worst part is? It's that we really are a couple. A beautiful couple. - Blue or rare? - Rare. Secretary, nurse, cook, eh? You still can’t be fucked to put a steak on the grill. Give it here, I'll do it. - All right. - Because this is getting a bit much. Go ahead. Do it. Go ahead. I don't know the cooking times. One minute each side for blue. 3-4 minutes, rare. OK, just let me do it. What do you want with it? Nothing, it'll be fine like that. - Are you going to see her again? - Pardon? I said: are you going to see her again? Who? I don't know. I don't think so. I doubt it. You will see her again. I'm telling you I won’t. Put that away. Don't look at me like that. It's just that I waited. That's all. I'm glad you're here. I really am happy. All right, listen. It's all right. It's nothing, it's... - It’s my fault. - No, it's mine. It's yours, it's mine, it's ours. Hello. - Can I come in? - If you want. Are you alone? I'm not staying, I have to meet my brother. He's an excellent doctor, by the way, if you need one. Thank you, it's not necessary. - You have a pretty place. - No, it's not pretty. The people in the building don't look like much fun. They’re all narrow-minded. The people are narrow-minded. They don't engage with anything. They have it all, so they don't need to open themselves up. That means death. When you don't have to go looking for food, when you have everything at home: food, information, you don't need to go out anymore. At the same time, we can't control anything anymore. We don't know what we eat. we don't know what's going on, how things work. Goods arrive. Information comes in. We have the telephone, the Minitel. You can even get your kicks like that, without ever meeting anyone. I met someone. A friend of yours. - Ana Paula. - Ana Paula? Ana Paula. She told me that you had been very ill. She's exaggerating. She told me that you almost died. I was just lacking vitamin B12 for a while, that's all. How are you doing now? Are you eating? Sleeping? Yes. You're lucky. I’m not sleeping well. That smells weird. What is it? Wakame. Can I have a glass of water? Thank you. Your tap is leaking. You know, a plumber explained to me: you have to avoid tightening the taps. Because you crush the joints. There are joints inside. You crush them, and that's why it leaks. You have to tighten taps delicately. Have you ever had insomnia? A leaky tap, a rattling window, a mosquito whistling around your head, that kind of torture... For me, it's not... It's not a tap, it's not a... It's not a mosquito. It's not a noise. It's a word. One word spinning around in my head. I have to repeat it to myself for hours on end. Until it loses its energy, its power. And yet, this word has no meaning. Do you know what I mean? I don't see how one word can have such power. Exactly, it's... It's stupid. It makes me ashamed. It's childish. I’m going to tell you the word. It’s... ersatz. Ersatz? I’ve never told anyone. But I'm telling you, I don't know why. It's like someone who knocks on your door. Someone you've been spying on, who wants to be recognised. Ah? Perhaps. That's good. It's strangely perceptive. I don't understand why you're here. In a way, neither do I. I should be down there. Besides, I can see my brother who must be getting impatient. You should leave. - Am I scaring you? - No. - You hold me in contempt. - I don't hold anyone in contempt. Wait, Florence. What's going on, Florence? What are you doing? You shouldn't get up, Mum. Go back to your room. Go back to your room. I'll be right there. Seven years already. I thought you wouldn’t come. Why is that? You didn't come last year. I was writing last year. I had plans last year. I had hope, I had a future. Things not going well? - Hey, I could use some time off. - Of course, whenever you want. You know, the house in Noirmoutier is still there. - Seriously. - Yes, but the problem is Aliette. She can't swim. She hates the sea. You’re not Siamese twins. That's easy to say. Listen, you're right. “Thus I go forth into faraway lands, “above my soul, are the stars alone.” - What? - Goethe, old chap. Goethe. It's true, I want to see the sky, I need some sea. I want to live. I want to fuck. Those lines are by me. How long has it been since you last got laid? Eh? Thomas the chaste, Saint Thomas, the angelic doctor. Huh? I'm asking you how long it’s been. You never saw Olga again after? Why are you asking me about Olga? You seemed to have a pretty good time with her. You never saw her again? She lives in America. - Of course. - It's been eight years. It's true. I don't know why I'm asking you about her. Did I hurt you? No, no. I didn't mean to. It wasn’t intentional. A flush of euphoria. A flush of euphoria, surrounded by tombs. But it's passed now. It's ok. Is your insomnia better? I guess. And that thing, that word that stopped you sleeping? - Has that stopped? - Ah yes, more or less. Are you going to tell me now? What? The word? Yes, the word. This word is software. You see, nothing to make a fuss about. OK, listen... - It's good that you came. - Yeah. Bye. Ladies and gentlemen, I know that you are all very busy. I’m not begging. This newspaper, produced by the homeless, costs 10 francs. I’m selling it to pay for my little room, to eat and stay clean while I try to find work. I don't have enough change. I can make change. From a 500 franc note? - You don't have 50 francs? - No, I don't... Maybe there’s someone... No, it doesn't matter. Take it. - But young man! - No, take it. Hello. Hello. I’m amazed. I can't believe it. Life is magical. I’ve been in Paris since Sunday, and I run into you. - Sunday? - It's incredible. What’s more, I just bought your book. Have I changed that much? It’s true, eight years... My hair has grown, but still... Oh my God, Olga... You're in Paris? What do you think? No, I mean, you're not... No, I'm not in San Diego, since I’m here in Paris. That’s incredible. I was talking about you with Thomas just this morning. I believe in these things. I do so believe in these things. In fact, I believe more than that. Life is magical. ...I know that you are all very busy... Do you have time now? Are you working? No... Well, yes. Can't you give him 10 francs? - I don't have it. - You haven’t changed. ...to eat and stay clean while I try to find work. - Here you go. - Why me? You give it to him. No. But... No, wait. Too bad for me. Are you out of your mind? Go on, give it back to him. You see, life is magic. I enabled you to earn 500 francs. - Really... - What "really"? You could have got something else. A punch in the face, a stabwound. It's incredible how much Paris has changed. Three years ago, I got into trouble in Tijuana, Now I only feel safe if I have this with me. My husband wasn’t happy. Are you crazy? We don't use those here. I don't intend to use it. Can we see each other? I have to be here for a while. In eight years, not a sign, I don't even know where you live. I didn't want to call Thomas. We need to talk. I have some things to tell you. Are you all right? You look tired. Are you still with Nadine? No, it's been over for a while. She's dead. I'm sorry. It's been seven years. And you're still with your peanut planter? Yes, I have two wonderful daughters. That's terrible news. No, no, we’d already split up. I read out about it in the paper. Excuse me, this is where I get off. - Your number... are you in the phone book? - No. Besides, I haven’t got anything to write with. I’m staying at the Kléber Palace Hotel. Give me a call. Give me a call. Bergère... It's good to see you. Yes, I have a seminar here. - Did you receive my book? - Yes. I sent it to you three months ago. It was at your request, right? Yes, absolutely, I mean... absolutely. Moreover, I have read it - there are some great things in it. - Thank you. - Yes, great. I started writing a little letter to you... Don't feel obliged. No, but I’d very much like to talk about it. It's... I'll wait for your little letter, since you started writing it. Bye. Wait... Aren’t you at Paris X university? I’m trying to register here. I’d like to do my dissertation with you. Uh, okay. Let’s talk about it later. - I wanted to tell you something. - Yes? After tea at my house, you remember? Of course. How could I forget? My friend Aurore ate the last tart, the raspberry one. And? Did she get sick? Not at all. She loves summer fruits. What I wanted to tell you was... I thought about the fact that you chose first, raspberry, to force Bruno to take the lemon one. - Have you two made up? - No, but it doesn't matter. In fact, you forced your own hand too. If you hadn't been thinking about it, perhaps you’d have preferred lemon, not raspberry. That's a good point. And everyone took one they didn't want. That's it. - Catherine... - Yes? Catherine... I don't know how to be direct. I'm not good at it. Every time I try, it's a disaster, but hey. You can tell me anything. You don't want me to do my dissertation with you. You don't want me to try to see you again, right? - Do I scare you? - Not at all, it’s not that. We’re having a big party for my 20th and I would really like you to come. Even if I annoy you. Maybe you could see me now and then, out of charity. - I’m not Catholic. - I was joking. Can I attend your course? I’m sorry. Only registered students. You should try to be generous, just once, just to see what it’s like. - OK? - I'm OK. Even Thomas thinks I'm doing OK. You look like you've seen a ghost. That's more or less it. I just met Olga. Olga, the American? - She’s no more American than you are. - I was just saying... I didn't even recognise her. She recognised me. Yet she hasn't changed. Apart from the hair, maybe... I must have a hole in my head. There's a hole where your heart was, otherwise you’re fine. She thought that Nadine... What do I do? Have another or not? - Don't. - There you go. - She thought that Nadine...? - I don't want to talk about it. I'm telling you I don't want to to talk about it. So don't talk about it. You look pale. Yeah, I'm tired. Actually, I asked Thomas to... to sign me off work. You asked for time off, now? Yes. You know he was crazy about Nadine? In fact, it’s because of her that he hates me. Thomas? He spends his life thinking he's shit, and that you're a genius. He worships you. Yes, well... Beneath worship lies hatred. Maybe you should see Laville. - Huh? - Oh no, no way. I'll call him. - No, no. - I, I... Hello? Yes, I'll put him on. Hello? Yes, hello, Catherine. No, you're not disturbing me. No, I can't. I won't be in Paris. No... Noirmoutier. No, you’re not being indiscreet. I have a house there. No, it's not excessive. A fortnight or so. Yes, we'll talk... We'll talk about it after. In the meantime, happy birthday. Goodbye. She can be clingy, that one! - Since when do you go to Noirmoutier? - Huh? I said: since when do you go to Noirmoutier? Since now. You said yourself that I need a holiday. Why Noirmoutier? It was Thomas' idea. You know what I think of the sea... Maybe you didn't intend to take me with you. I don't know. And Denis the cat, I'm supposed to look after him? I don't know. Fine. That's clear. She’ll meet you there, I suppose? Don't be absurd... You said Noirmoutier so that she’d know about it. No. I said Noirmoutier because I thought about Noirmoutier. When is this inquisition going to end? Huh? I’m asking you when this inquisition is going to end. When are you going to stop poisoning me with your venomous compassion? With your suspicions. Even your hands. I never want you to touch me again. No man worthy of the name would put up with being bound together by ivy and weeds. You still want me to get treatment. Look at yourself... You too could use a doctor. - And maybe more so than me. - You're right. I'm going to get treatment. Aliette... Aliette. Aliette... - Are you from around here? - No, I got here yesterday. I’ve been here eight days. The weather is changeable... Yesterday it rained all day. Today it’s fine but the wind... That's very nice... I don't know how you can concentrate in such wind. Oh, it's fine. In Arles, Van Gogh had to attach himself to trees to paint. Because of the Mistral. But it's great to be here. I was a wreck when I arrived. It's not warm enough to swim, but... I go for a dip first thing, I don't mind the cold. The colder it is, the better I like it. - Are you here alone? - What if I am? No, I didn't mean that. I don't even understand homosexuality. I know I came up to you... We don't know each other, I start talking to you... It's my job to talk. I’m a professor. Professor and writer. I came here to write a book. A novel? I have two ideas. The first is that there are two kinds of man. Those who talk, and those who fuck. - Those who fuck don't talk, those who talk don't fuck. – Oh yeah? And then the second one is... That both categories are unhappy. Or at least, they both have problems. Because you can't always talk and not fuck, or fuck all the time and not talk. So sooner or later, those who fuck have to talk, and those who talk have to fuck. And that's when they get into trouble. All of them. What about women? Ah, women... Hey... A young man your age all alone on holiday here, it's a mystery to me. Is it the landscape? Are you at art school? I’m here because... - Exiled? - I wouldn't go that far. I'm in exile. I killed my wife, I strangled my cat. Really? I also killed my first wife by... tampering with the steering on her car. Really? What solitude... How peaceful it is here. I thought I'd try my hand on some innocent... On a young dope like you. If I push you off the top of the cliff... There are no witnesses. No one will know if it’s a murder, a suicide or an accident. Don't panic, I'm kidding. I hope you aren’t angry. I say whatever comes into my head. It's the weather... All the best. You should have come, it was great. I met a boy up there. - He made beautiful drawings. - Is that so? We talked a bit. Well, I did. I’ve brought the papers. Didn't you go shopping? Is there more in there? Thank you. Ah, it's cold. I'll reheat the water. Come here. You've got salt in your hair. Have I? Someone has come to see you. Here? Impossible. No, it isn’t. She’ll be back. - But who is it? - How should I know? Ah, there she is again, I think. Hello. Good morning, Mr Vichac. Did the lady tell you? You’ve been invited this evening. I’m five kilometres away, overlooking the sea. If you drive, it's easy, but I can call a taxi for you. I don't know... do we know each other? Not me. My name is Lin Tong. But you know Mademoiselle Rateau. We’re celebrating her birthday. At the moment, they’re out crab fishing. This is it. I rented it for the weekend with my uncles and brothers. - But how did you know that... - You have a brother too? This is his house. I believe in brothers. Everything happens through brothers. [chatter] - Good evening. - Good evening. What did you say? Could you get me a martini, please? Good evening. This is the young man I told you about, from earlier. - Good evening. - It's a pleasure. Good evening. I am his wife. - Your wife? - That's right. Good evening. Good evening, Madam. - OK... - Good. See you later? Good evening, Mr. Vichac. - That's the one... - Bye sir. Thank you for the invitation. - Yes, thank you. Thank you for coming. - Can I get you a drink? - Yes, thank you. Yeah, I screamed. And he says to me: wait, Aurore, if I hadn't called you... We won't see each other anymore... I haven't wanted to see him for three months already... Can I help you with anything? - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Ah yes, maybe, the shrimps need to be peeled. All right. Excuse me. Why are you letting her into the kitchen? What’s the harm? She doesn't know anything about Chinese cuisine. - Good evening. - Aliette. - Catherine. - Happy birthday. Thank you. 20 years, I won't let anybody say Aurora etc. etc. - Aurore. - Good evening. - What happened to you? - Oh, it's nothing, it's... No, I'm the one who... She's joking. I was asked to do some work in the kitchen. Can you show me where it is? Yes. This way. Besides, I've got something to do, too. You’re wearing the same skirt as Catherine the other day. Yes, it’s mine. Don't tell her I told you. She won't be best pleased. - Do you want a drink? - Yes. Are you sure you don't want an apron? No, thank you. A party by the sea at this time of year, you’re lucky. Aurore organised it, for her friend. I’m very happy. Did you go out on a boat today? Yes, it was great. I couldn't do that. When I see the sea, I feel like it’s going to... that it’s going to swallow me. I can't swim. That's a shame. Could you pass me an egg? Thank you. You say you’re happy. Are you really? Yes, why? Well, you must be glad that my husband is here, but a little less glad that I came with him. Eh? He dragged me here against my will. No, that's not true. I dragged him here. - He didn't want to come. - I know. I scare him. Believe me, I'm glad you’re here. I wanted to see you. Is that so? Why? Stop attacking me. You’ll make me mess up the mayonnaise. I’m not attacking you. It’s a genuine question. He’s the one you’re interested in, not me. I'm interested in you too. Damn, it's spoiled. Did he tell you that? No, I’ve been living with him for ten years. Ten years. I met him through his brother. I went to Paris to go to medical school. He was in love with me. His brother. A very touching boy, very... very sensitive, healthy, balanced. Can you pass me another egg? At one point it was a choice between the doctor and the patient, and I chose the patient. Why do you say the patient? Thomas would have loved me. He would have given me lots of children. He would have raised them well. We’d have had beautiful summers. We’d have had beautiful autumns. Makes you think of an ad for an insurance company. Yes. That's why I stayed with Vichac. - I see. - No, you don’t see anything at all! Okay? And now I'm all washed up. I'm going to freshen up quickly. I'll be OK. - I'm sorry. - Hurry up! Everyone is waiting for you to do karaoke. Just a minute, I'm talking to a guest. It's rude. Listen to me for once. - OK. - Hurry up! So Catherine takes everything from you? Your name, your work, your skirts. Careful, she could even take your soul. I'm not worried, I haven't got one. That's what they say... But a body like yours, must have a soul to go with it. What do you have against her, Catherine I mean? What did she do to you? Why are you so contemptuous? Nothing. She's cute, but... Girls who chase after me leave me cold. It leaves me completely cold. Come with me, I’d like to ask you something. Is the bathroom this way? - Pardon? - This way to the bathroom? Yes. At the end of the corridor. On the left, I think. Did you see that ass? Yeah. - Those little trees over there... - Which trees? With the red leaves. - What are they? - They’re prunus trees, I think. - Ah, that's it. Pissers. - What? That’s what they call them in the north. You know, Aurore, the work you did on my book, Cristal... - It’s very good. - Thank you. It's very intelligent, well reasoned. You have a good head on you. And not just the head. There’s something I don’t understand about you. I mean, we have the sea, the sky, all of that... And all you want is to see my breasts. I find it a bit sinister. The sea, the sky... We aren’t in boundless nature, Aurore. We're at a dead end. A dead end? Yes, a dead end. You, me, everyone. A dead end. We're at a dead end, and it's true, I want to see your breasts. Whatever. Happy? I’m sorry. Just admit you did a stupid thing. I have nothing to confess. - Well, that's that. - It's awful. Not really. Not really? You should see yourself. It's terrible. I’m telling you: it's nothing. It's just an ersatz. A what? Nothing. Come on, let’s go and see those little trees. You’re crazy. You’re scary. You’re really scary. It’s a crime, that's for sure. We’re committing a crime. And on Catherine’s birthday. Would it be less of a crime if it was another day? It would be less of a sacrilege. She's my best friend, damn it. And your wife, do you do this to her often? Every Tuesday. Don't worry. It had to happen. I’ve felt it coming for a long time. As if you had nothing at all to do with it. What is it? Nothing. I have no idea what I’m doing. It's uncharted territory. It's something else, right? - Shall we go in? - Now? Yes. But it's cold. We'll freeze. No, it’ll be good. Ah, I don't care. Let's take a dip, In the sea. Where’s the crime? The crime is in your head. I know that much. So, are you coming? Leave me alone. Come on. I'm off. Catherine! Stop! Stop! Don’t go. Stop! Henri, help me, damn it! All right, calm down. Shit! Where are we? I don't know. The current carried us away. We stayed in too long. - Uh, which side is the house on? - I don't know. We can't stay here. What a mistake. What have I done? What a mistake. - It must be that way. - No, it's not. It has to be that way. Where are our clothes? Uh... don't panic. We'll find them. What were we thinking! - What a snoop you are! - How would I know that? I warned you. Oh, leave me alone! You really are looking for trouble. I don't know how it happened. I was preparing for days, so everyone would have fun... - I have a déjà vu. - What? I've lived this before, I'm sure of it. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. Do whatever you want, but we have to reassure them. - How could I have predicted this? - Shut up! Where is Aliette? You didn’t see her? She's out looking for you. In which direction? I don't know. She left two hours ago. Where's Aurore? Where's Henri? We had a fight. He went back in the car. Where did he go? He told me to tell you it's over, he doesn't want to see you anymore. Never again. You don't believe me? I swear it's true. "Too much is too much,” I’m quoting. We just went for a swim. We were swept away by the current. It’s not a crime. You're really... He doesn't give a shit about you. - You've known it all along, so... - Shut up, now! You shut up! Give me a break! We didn't do anything. Aliette... Get lost. - But... - Really. I'm really asking you. I never want to see you again. You’re dead to me. So? - Hello Bruno. - Hello madam. I brought you some slates. Hello. Hello. - Your favourite posture. - I’m hibernating. - It’s not the season for it. - It's a manner of speaking. I have something to tell you, but I don't know how. Not more emotional stuff, I hope, because... - No, this is factual. - What is it? Don't you want to play with us? What is it? Aurore is with me. - Are you kidding? - No, what I mean is... We’re not "together". She came here with me. You didn't take her? Don't look at me like that. You mean to say that she's here in this village? It's not witchcraft. It's an hour's drive. - She wants to fix things. - There's nothing to fix. Scrabble is better with three, isn't it? In any case, it’s faster. That way, we'll be out of here quicker. Go on, choose. - What did you get? - O. Your turn. Sixteen. Are you doing this on purpose? What? What did I do? Can't you see you’ve got a Scrabble, you silly cow? - How so? - With the G. That's a good start, shit. I didn't even see it. Does it still count? Of course it counts, it exists, doesn't it? Just because it exists doesn’t mean it’s OK. Shut up and count your points. Waw. Ah, I'd stopped expecting you. I'm leaving on Monday. Can I come in? Can I have a drink? Take what you like. There's a mini-bar. My God, what happened to you? Did you have an accident? - I was mugged. - I knew it! - What did you know? - I knew there were muggers in Paris too. There’s no peace anywhere. I can't stand living in terror anymore. It wasn't in Paris. My friends told me it was a safe city, but no city is safe anymore. Except Singapore, maybe, or Dubai. But Dubai, last time I was there, I was so bored... - I'm telling you it wasn't in Paris. - Good. What? What's wrong? I look tired? You haven't improved either, you know. Well, nothing bad happened to me. I never come home late. I've always gone to bed early. You know that. And then go out? Who would I go with? I thought you'd never come. I feel terribly lonely. I nearly called Thomas even. That’s saying something. Luckily, I resisted. I was able to go and see all the exhibitions. It’s become an awful, stupid town. The Louvre pyramid... The Bastille Opera, all those monstrosities... Be careful! It’s loaded. The trigger is very sensitive. I practice every morning. At Gastinne Renette's. You have to be careful. Walking around with it is a double-edged sword. Since I've been in Paris, I haven’t spoken to a normal guy. Someone who isn’t in business with my husband, I mean. He didn't want to join you? He’s afraid of diseases. He doesn't want to set foot in Europe. He calls me day and night. He gives me orders at a distance. I can’t help doing stupid things. There you go. Good timing. Will you excuse me? Yes, thank you. Put him on. Yes, Mike. Fine. Yes, I talked with my husband. You want to know what he says? It's very simple. The shit hit the fan. Quotation. OK? So please, do not say anymore you are going to solve it. Please do it, and do it fast. OK? Could you wait a moment? Are you leaving already? Yes. I'll leave you my number. Can't you stay a bit? No. Could you wait a moment? What are you doing? What do you have in mind? I don't understand. I have to go. No. Excuse me! Sorry... I've been here for an hour. I need to talk to you. I have nothing to say to you. You’re surprisingly defensive. What are you afraid of? I’m not going to force you to go back to your dissertation. You can't force me to do anything. That's what I like with you. Direct. Boom! And how is your mother? Well. I’m glad. Is she here? No. What about your husband? What do you want from me? Won't you let me in? Hold on. - I’ll help you unpack your shopping. - No. I'm glad to see you're back on a more varied diet. Are you still seeing your Brazilian friend? When it comes to it, I know next to nothing about you. You know me. From the start, you had me pegged. I can't stand that thought. Maybe I'd be better off trying to make you laugh? I used to be a communist. I must have comic talents. Usually, all I have to do is say dictatorship of the proletariat, and everyone falls about laughing. What are you after? Why have you come here to do this dreadful number? You look exhausted. You’re trembling. Are you ill? I’m alone, Florence. Completely alone. I know, it's nobody else's concern. All I can do is face things bravely... Clench my teeth, regain my dignity. Put on a manly mask. Negotiate life like a solo sailor. Like Tabarly. Or the other chap, the one from your generation. D’Aboville? That's the one. Honestly, I don’t get that at all. It bores me rigid. I have zero respect for solo sailors. It might be my only source of pride, this total absence of... respect for solo sailors. Stop scratching like that! You’re crazy. You’re bleeding. Do you have something to ask me? I don't know if I’m capable. What I have to ask you is... is to live with me. There, I said it. I didn't think I could do it. I still have a buzzing noise in my head. But I said it. I'm asking you. I’m begging you, I’m imploring you, Florence… to share your life with me. To share... what's left of my life. Why? Ah, if I have to tell you why as well... I don't know... Maybe it's because you believe... I don't know what you believe, but I don't care. It's calming to believe, and I need calm. You're mocking me again, and yourself. I could have said it was... because I love you. That would have been easier, but less honest. No, what I can tell you is... that I like your... let's say passion. No, in fact, I desire it. It entices me. I'd like to share in it. Is that a yes? You'll see, you won't regret it. In spite of everything, I'm a great guy. Maybe I would have. - You would have? - Yes. In spite of my husband. Give me that. If I’d believed it would help you. Only... Every word you say... Every confession, every oath that you make, is blasphemy. Blasphemy against what you’ve already said. That's why I didn’t want... That I could no longer work with you. I was afraid of being contaminated. - Contaminated? Charming. - Yes, by your negativity. Now I don't care. Only I feel sorry for you. Oh, that kind of talk... I know, eh? Nothing and no one can save me, etc. What if I don’t want to to be saved, after all? What if I want to... What if I want the opposite? What if I want to lose myself? Do you want to lose yourself? Fine, go ahead. But go all the way. Are you in? You should put that down. What are you doing here? I'm here, that's all. Put it down. You're here because I have this. So I'm not going to put it down. Was it Olga? She called Thomas' house, I replied. I got scared. You were scared too, huh? How moving. Anyone would have been afraid. Come on. Come on, please. - Come on, give me that. - No. - Are you back to stay? - No. To pick up the cat. Shit. All right, that's enough. Stop now. Listen, Aliette. Listen to me carefully. I’m holding this. And I’m aware, I am more than aware, I am supremely aware how ridiculous... - I don't care. - Let me talk, damn it. How ridiculous... it would be not to use it. If I use it, of course, I’ll be freed. It’s your reasoning that’s ridiculous. If you die to be free of ridicule, that's ridiculous. Relax. I'm sure that more than... half of all murders and suicides are down to fear of ridicule. Actually, I’d like to know what idiot invented the expression - “ridicule won't kill you”. - It's possible. Let's say you are, as you say, completely ridiculous, I’d still prefer you ridiculous than dead. Come on. You're sure about that? I thought I was already dead to you. I’m sure of nothing. Stop it. Stop it. Don't push me. That bitch Olga says the trigger is highly sensitive. I stuck it in my mouth. I don't know how it didn't go off. I feel like I've still got it in my mouth. I wonder how I’m even able to talk. Even with a bazooka in your mouth, you’d talk. Very funny. Very amusing. No, I don't think you understand. I'm here, I'm talking to you, I hear you, I see you, but... It doesn't mean anything. I'm starting to get a cramp in my hand. I can't move my finger. I can't take it off. Yes, you can. Stop, I'll shoot. I can't help myself. Yes, you can. No, I swear, I can't. You need to calm down. Come on now, calm. Calm down. Relax. But it’s... Abel! Open up! Abel! Open up! Abel, open up! Open up! Abel! Abel, open up! Ah, the doctor! My friend, my brother, my saviour! What have you done? What do you care? Why would you care all of a sudden? Where is she? What have you done? Where is she? What have you done? You stupid bastard! You broke my coccyx. She’s fine. She’s fine, I tell you, it's just fear. She passed out. - I don't know what's holding me back. - Well, don't hold back! Go ahead, it's so tedious, holding back. See what it's made you, holding back all these years. Bastard. I asked you not to come. Come on now. Come on. - No, leave me alone. - Come on. It's OK, I know what I'm doing. I'm not hurt. You scared us ringing the bell. She's right. We were discussing quietly, then you come along... Give me that... Give me that thing first. Give it to me. You're completely crazy. Leave us, Thomas. - Out of the question. - Please! Come on, give. Give it to me. You could get hurt. I’ll send it back to Olga. And then what? Come on, it's all right, I've already fired. I'm not going to do it again. The bullet’s there, in the floorboards. I may have killed the neighbour downstairs, but it doesn't matter, he was a pain in the ass. Aliette could never play piano after 10pm. So you’d like me to trust you? Something like that. - I hate you. - Oh yeah. Why is that? I hate you because you're my brother. That seems a good enough reason. There are others, but I don't feel like going into them. I hope I'm not making a mistake. Thank you. - It’s OK. - I hope so. Bye. He gave it back to me, the idiot. I can't believe it. Nice. I really want to shoot you, right in the face. I really want to. I'm telling you, when you have it in your hand, you feel like shooting. It’s dangerous. Give it back to me. - Crazy fool. - Go on, give it back to me. Sit down. I'll get you a drink. - No, I'm going to go. - No? Are you going to go back to Thomas’ place? I don't know. I don't think so. I’ll go to a hotel. Then what? Don't worry about me. I won't worry about you – it’s for myself. That's nice. No, it's not a question of... grilling steak, you understand? Yes. - I'm sure you don't. - Yes, I understand. OK. Goodbye. Do you mean adieu? Yes. Adieu. Adieu, Abel. Did you forget something? Denis the cat. You might kiss me. Better than that, maybe? I’ll try.
