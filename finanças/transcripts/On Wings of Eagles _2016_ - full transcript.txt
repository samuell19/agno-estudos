Eric Liddell, the Brit who snatched the gold in the 400 meter, was offered a chance at the American dream. But the famous athlete, who, despite multiple sponsorship offers from dozens of American brands, has respectfully said no to one and all. He has joined the London Missionary Society, and after moving to China married the love of his life, nurse Florence Mackenzie. There, they will raise a family. He will teach and live a productive life. For Mr. Liddell, offering a helping hand and some hope provides all the riches he needs. XU: With any luck, you will find someone in your life to help make you a worthy person. That luck came to me many years ago when I met the Flying Scotsman. His name was Eric Liddell. The whole world came to know him when he refused to run the 400-meter race scheduled on a Sunday, which he reserved for the time he spent rejoicing with his family and giving thanks for the many blessings bestowed upon them. In the glory of winning, he became famous for a man who stood up for his principles. But to him, it was not such a grand gesture. After he completed his education, he returned to China where he taught chemistry, English and athletics. The many years of the Japanese fighting the Chinese had worn away our happiness and brought a great misery to our people. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (DOGS BARKING) Get the soldiers! Hold it! Hold it! (SOLDIER SPEAKING MANDARIN) (SPEAKING MANDARIN) XU: Born poor, I developed my ways. I made it work whenever and however it became necessary. Professor Liddell called me by my name, Xu Niu, and paid me to drive him to teach the poor children in the schools there. (CHILDREN SHOUTING) (ERIC GREETING IN MANDARIN) (CHILDREN SPEAKING MANDARIN) ERIC: In we go! Up, up. Up, up. Sit down. Quiet, please. Sit down. P for Peter, C for Cat. Cat? Er, Dong Nong? Dong Nang? (SPEAKING MANDARIN) (ENGINES ROARING) (DISTANT EXPLOSION) No! Song, no! Song! Song! XU: In my early years, I would only run from a nest of hornets or escape a man who would put me in jail. But I would run with Mr. Li. Running helped him find peace. But on this day, I was struck by his fearlessness as he ran to find peace in the face of an escalating war. Florence is gonna kill you for this. Me, too, most probably. She'd do the same in my place. We came here to help these people. What will they think if we jump on a ship at the first sign of trouble? Your children are people, too, Eric. They're young. Florence will be there for them. Let me finish what I started. Please, give this to someone in need. (DISTANT EXPLOSION) (GASPS) (WHIMPERING) - Shh. - Daddy, I'm scared. It's all right. It's all right. Now, listen, how does that... How does that melody go that Mommy loves so much? Can you help me? - ♪♪ Be still my soul - (PLAYING XYLOPHONE) ♪♪ The Lord is on your side You have a go. ♪♪ Bear patiently ♪♪ The cross of grief Or pain ♪♪ Florence. (GUNS FIRING IN DISTANCE) Thank the Lord they're good sleepers. I promised to help the hospital in Xiaozhang. They need medical supplies more than ever. And now Robert's son is... Sick. Yes, I know. And he had to go back to England to care for him. But your brother is a doctor. You're not. We've made a family. Not just God's family, our own. I love you, Florence. Absolutely and utterly. I know what sort of man I married. Now help me pack. Come on, Heather. Xu looks magnificent, doesn't he? There you go. Xu. Please take good care of him while we're away. You can count on me, Ms. Li. I will make sure Eric is safe. XU: Prior to the occupation, Mr. Li had applied for a furlough from the London Missionary Society, allowing him to travel to Canada with his family, but permission had not yet arrived. He felt he was duty bound to serve those in need in the good times and the bad. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (FOG HORN BLOWING) Well, you know I'll be there as soon as I can. You have to let your grandmother know we're all fine. You have to show her how beautiful your handwriting has become, and I have to show the children here how to write as beautifully as you do. Please don't think this is a gold medal. Oh, Florence. I love you. One last hug, darlings. We'll be together again soon. We'll all be together again soon. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Ladies and gentlemen. Anybody who is not sailing with us, please leave the boat. I'll be home soon. - PATRICIA: Bye. - Bye. I love you. HEATHER: I'm going to miss you. I'll miss you, too. I'll be home soon. You look after the new baby for me now, okay? You promise? HEATHER: I promise. Promise? XU: Even though the Japanese Imperial Army had looted and taken over his home, Mr. Li believed in praying for his enemies. I had other thoughts, but I kept them to myself, as I was learning to respect Mr. Li. Much time would pass before I found the value in thinking his way. Mr. Li was forced to leave his home and seek shelter with the other refugees at the school where he was teaching. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) For me? Let's go for a run. Come on, now! (BOY SHOUTING IN MANDARIN) XU: He ran every day without fail. It took me some time to realize he was running not just for himself, but for us. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) So, gather around. Ferrous sulfide. Acid. You smell? (ALL GROANING) (SPEAKING MANDARIN) (ALL LAUGHING) Yeah. Oh, yeah. Good girl. What have you got? Oh! Maureen. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) Come here. Yes, that's me. Before the hair slipped off the back of my head. Where on earth did you find this? I have my way. Found it a long time ago. It's for you. Thanks. You know, would you help me find an orphanage that can look after him? Well, listen, I was born here, so surely that makes me Chinese, too, no? You know, I've been living here for half my life, so I raise a cup to you, my friends, with a drink that comes from my first home. Oof! (CLEARS THROAT) You know my... You know my brother Robert? He ran the hospital in Xiaozhang. He wrote to me before he left, asking for supplies for the doctors there, if we can buy them. No. Your father give you this. I'm afraid it's all I have now. But he would have been happy if it could help. XU: No, not with this. Please. I hope it's worth enough. It's quite a long list. (ENGINE SHUTS OFF) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Oh, no. Let me handle this. I'm so sorry. Teaching. Teaching. Thank you. (EXHALES) XU: As the months passed, we encountered many close calls with the Japanese soldiers. Life was full of danger, and we were often caught in the crossfire of the armies that fought each other. With Eric's dedication to help those in need and my connections to the underground, we found ways to accomplish our missions. (WOMAN SPEAKING MANDARIN) Well, that wasn't so bad. NURSE: Eric, do you mind? There is a dying patient to pray over. ERIC: Of course. Come on. (BOY SPEAKING MANDARIN) Go! Come on! Come on! You've got two hands, don't you? Repeat after me. "I, Hugh." I, Hugh. "Take thee, Catherine, to be my wedded wife." Take thee, Catherine, to be my wedded wife. "To have and to hold from this day forward." To have and to hold from this day forward. "For better, for worse." For better, for worse. "For richer, for poorer..." Please, this is a house of God. Could we have the weapons... (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Captain, you have no right to be here. Could we just... (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Captain, you have no right to be here. We are at war. (BOY SPEAKING MANDARIN) - (STEAM HISSING) - (HORN BLOWING) (MEN SHOUTING) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) No, no, we're, we're married. We're... Go this way? No, no, we're together. We're married. We go together. No, no. Hold on a second. Hold on. You can't separate us. We're together! Hold on! Catherine is my wife. Let us live together. How could you prove? You can! You were there! You were at the wedding! No. Whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. My Emperor is the god here. Huh? We do not serve false gods. Please. You're a big guy. Come on, take my bunk. We'll get through this, together. Hey, doc. David, hey. I came across this. I think it's more your style. Thank you. Yeah. (GRUNTS) Xiao, Xiao. (SPEAKS MANDARIN) (YELLING) (WHIMPERS) (CRYING) (CONTINUES CRYING) See? No! GUARD: Get up! Get up! Who is Eric Liddell? Who? ERIC: I am! You go. - What are you doing? - Hey! What? He wants to race? And train. I want a fair fight. When you release us, I will race. You have no choice. We found these. XU: Xiao Shitou and I had searched for days. When we found the camp, it had been turned into a prison and more intimidating than I had ever encountered. I knew then I would have to employ the ways of my past to be of any help to my friend. (SPEAKS MANDARIN) Shitou! (ALL EXCLAIMING IN JOY) Christmas has come early, Dr. Hubbard. Good luck. I missed you so much. (SOBBING) God, I missed you. I missed you, too. Look at you. I'll try and shave next time. (CHUCKLES) You shouldn't have stayed here. Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. It's okay. Look. I made it for you. No diamonds this time. You stay, I stay. Remember? We're going. We're going. SOLDIER: Come on! Come on! She's going, okay? ERIC: There's a mountain out here. You see the little lamb when it's lost, and we're singing a song to bring the lamb back. ♪♪ There were ninety and nine ♪♪ That safely lay ♪♪ In the shelter of the fold ♪♪ But one was lost On the hills away ♪♪ Far off from The gates of gold Happy, happy, we're gonna get this. ♪♪ There were ninety and nine That safely lay ♪♪ In the shelter of the fold ♪♪ But one was lost On the hills away ♪♪ Far off from The gates of gold ♪♪ (WHISTLES) (ALL GASP) (ERIC WHISTLES) (KIDS GASP) (SHUSHES) ERIC: Now, the trees convert the carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, C02 into oxygen. The tree also uses the process of photosynthesis, which we talked about earlier. Now, question, where does the tree get its water from? The roots. Yes, the roots. Stop! (EXCLAIMING) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) You got this. Come on! (CHEERING AND CLAPPING) Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric! Eric!

Come on! Come on! Look at him! He's starving! Get off me! You won today's race the day Japan invaded China. No... Come on! He's down already! (SPEAKING JAPANESE) We all thank you. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (EXHALES IN PAIN) Li. Eric. Here you go. They'll kill you. They'll kill you. How did you get here? You know, I have my way. Your ways... (PANTING) David. David needs water. He needs water. I have something for you. Eric, you anger the Japanese. They're going to kill you. We need to get you out of here. What good will that do the others? Hope. What do they have without you? (SOLDIER YELLS) (ALL CLAPPING) (ALL CHEERING) Welcome back, chaps. Can you walk okay? Sit down here, David. Okay, Eric, right here. How are you feeling? You're back. You're here. - I'm okay. I'm okay. - Anything broken? Eric. Anything I need to know about? You're okay? You sure? Get some water in you, and let's have a look at this eye. Okay? (SPEAKING JAPANESE) I hear the Japanese keep on losing battles at the front line. This is their second time food truck didn't come. I made them a deal. Ten o'clock Saturday night. Two times a month. XU: Life in prison was taking its toll on everyone, including the guards. I made a bargain with sources inside the prison. However, grave danger existed from the guards who would never bargain away the Emperor's imperial power. "N-A." Big "N," small "A." Sodium mixed with chloride gives us... What do you sprinkle in the... Salt. Xiao Shitou! Come here. What surprises do you have for us, huh? (ALL EXCLAIM HAPPILY) Here we go. That's yours. Xiao Shitou, would you like me to teach you some chemistry? Would you like Daisy to teach you some English? (EXCLAIMS) (SPEAKING JAPANESE) ...of the season. And this time of year when... When the light of the season... And they fall! Sit down, Daisy! I'm trying to conduct a class! Let's take a small break. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is Eric okay? (GIRL SPEAKING MANDARIN) (SHUSHES) (HUMMING TUNE) (INHALES SHARPLY) Hey! Xu Niu! (WHISPERS IN MANDARIN) Please. Please, you've got to get me out of here. Look... Look at what they've done to me. Please. Xu Niu, please, you've got to save me. They're gonna kill me. (SPEAKING MANDARIN) XU: Come. Xiao. Get in. (SOLDIER SHOUTING) Who helped David Marshall escape? No, no! WOMAN: Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! I don't know anything, okay? I don't know anything! Stop punishing us. You're supposed to be protecting us, not punishing us! If you have lost our friend, then you must find him for us. You will all be punished until I get a name. XU: David had made it out of prison. He decided to join the underground resistance forces to receive and translate news about Japan's increasing struggles to win the war. (CATHERINE PROTESTING) Catherine. Come on, no, no, no. You can't help like this. No! (CATHERINE SOBBING) No! No! - (WHIP STRIKES) - (GROANS) Follow my finger. Both eyes. It's painful over here. Right, it's this side, isn't it? Is that sore? Deep inside. Migraines are just more frequent now. All right, okay. Stand up. Both feet. Sit down. Oh, my God. My bunk. Put him on my bunk. We need some warm water and a cloth. Okay. Hugh, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Hugh? Do you know where you are? Catherine. Okay. Put this on your forehead. (HUGH COUGHING) (SHUSHES) Okay, okay, okay. It may be bronchitis, but more likely an acute bacterial pneumonia. He needs medicine. Soon. Otherwise... Any ideas? (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Major Kenji, you must provide medicine for the American, Hugh Johnson. We have no medicine. We have no food. Then I must ask that you turn a blind eye again and let these supplies be smuggled in. There has been no smuggling in this camp. Let me race you again. If I win, you permit one visitor to bring what we need. We have raced, Mr. Liddell. And I beat you. A proper race. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Thank you, Major. Sunday. One, two, three, go! (LAUGHING) (GROANS) Hope I'm not interrupting. No, no, no. The whole camp pitched in so you could have a proper meal, build up your strength for the race. That's very kind of them, but we all need our strength. If the shepherd starves, what becomes of his sheep? You can't win this race, you know. You shouldn't even try. It'll kill you. You know, I've often said it was the prayers of others that carried me to victory. Let's give them something to pray for. Hmm? Let's give them something to pray for. Come on, boys. Get back. Get back. Open the door! I've been here for two years. I wanted to watch one race! (GROANING IN PAIN) No shoes? A man runs with his feet, not his shoes. Quiet! Come on! Quiet! This won't help! Let's pray for him instead. ♪♪ Amazing grace ♪♪ How sweet the sound ♪♪ That saves a wretch Like me♪♪ Singing? ♪♪ I once was lost ♪♪ But now I'm found ♪♪ - (EXCLAIMS) - (SHOT FIRES) Boys, it's starting! The race! (ALL CHEERING) Yeah! Yeah! (ALL CHEERING) He is not here. Check again. It's nearly time. He's gonna bring the medicine any minute. Thank you. You have a visitor. Thank you. Thank you. Catherine. They're allowing medicine to be brought in tonight. I know. You'll get well soon. You'll get better. Yes. Be strong. You're going to be a father. (CHUCKLING) What? We thought you knew! You're pregnant? Congratulations, Hugh. You old dog. (BOTH LAUGHING) (SHOUTING IN JAPANESE) Xiao Shitou! Xiao Shitou! Xiao Shitou! Get down! Get down! Xiao! Don't! Xiao Shitou! (GRUNTING) (ALL YELLING) No! No! XU: My wife and I stayed all night at the fence, silently praying and mourning the loss of Xiao Shitou, the gentle boy we had adopted as our son. It was difficult to pray for those who were so cruel. (SPEAKING FRENCH) XU: The guard who tried to warn us was placed in the hole. Everyone was grateful for his kindness and courage. Hey. Would you let me do that? - Thank you. - Yeah. - Yeah, thank you. - You're welcome. Okay. Okay. - So go up to the point where I say... - Uh-huh. I was carrying too much responsibility. After months' rest... Much better. - Much better. - Okay. The Commandant Major Kenji Kurata has told me that I could be home around Christmas, according to the repatriation request. But Catherine, whose husband was lost to her not long ago, is pregnant, and for the sake of her and the baby, I asked the Commandant Major to let her go instead. I know you would have done the same. Everlasting love to yourself and the children. Eric.

XU: As difficult as it was, I had received his message. Eric Liddell's unwavering faith in the essential goodness of mankind had cracked the coldness of my earthly soul.

But the greatest gift of all was his gift of hope. Subtitles by explosiveskull
