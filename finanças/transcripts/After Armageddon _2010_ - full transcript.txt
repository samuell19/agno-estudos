This program is a theoretical account of the worst case scenario for global disaster. This is not a real emergency. Ever central tendency. In government to plan for the normal and disasters aren't normal. They're going to be overwhelmed. They're not going to be ready for. People are going to die and years isn't a whole lot we're going to be able to do about it. Meals away from at matter. Will start to see a true disintegration. People will for them together and gangs to go obtain the resources. Looking for food they're going to be looking for drugs. They're going to be some great a predators out there. Turn it up large urban centers will be uninhabitable. Dangerous places. Some small camera is would put up or. You're going to find things along the route that are going to be useful to you and you're going to take. You're going to have to forage which is a nice word for looting. Hardest thing in the world for anybody would be to take another life. The. Nothing could have prepared us for what happened. Millions dead in a matter of weeks. Billions across the world. America was devastated. Nowhere risperdal. The food water or power cities like ours became wastelands. We were just an ordinary family. But pretty soon we realized we wanted to stay alive we had to get out of the city the we thought we were leaving the worst behind us. But we were all. Were law lorna order is broken down and the the systems have broken down. That's really nightmare stuff. Very few of us have the skill sets to survive in as radically change or. At some point in a long-term crisis the cities of uninhabitable and you need to move and you have no choice you have to move. How do you stay secure. People trying to escape from city is they're going to encounter looters game Steve's. What you want to be as invisible as possible. Turn that off. If people see you you want their eyes just to roll over you. Keep him down. Most frightening to have family members with me that had to protect. It'd be hard to not feel tremendous sense of guilt about that. Once we hit the freeway we should be out of the city and like an hour. As if enough people tried to evacuate the road simply become so jammed. That you get traffic jams stretch for tens of miles what a check the freeway. Lock the doors. Roads become simply impassable. Peace will begin even to die in their vehicles in those vehicles block the roads and prevent further egress. Grid lock would be. A major secondary event. With that then the desperation go even higher. Freeways block we're going to try to get out of the next town real. People would masquerade as police pretending to be police or other authorities. Ellen. The. And it can be difficult for people to tell. Who is official who isn't. Who might be their song it and who isn't and many people would make mistakes. I think it's the national guard. Think maybe they can help the finally or. National guard wine then you. Get them down. This at. Concern is today mounting over a deadly new strain of influenza which is reportedly sweeping through parts of southeast Asia. The outbreak is believed to have already claimed the lives of over twenty five thousand people despite a raft of emergency measures to try and control it spread. We average a pandemic every thirty to forty years that it's a cycle that we can predict. It's almost one hundred years and he's already severe one. So we become think we're immune but let me tell the mother nature is still lurking there and if we had one of these rapid moving viruses like this wine to combine it with the fatality rate of avian flu we would see unspeakable indescribable catastrophe. Where the world now facing an official global pandemic alert. Us government agency has confirmed that were as yet no suspected cases in north america. However. Apply to. UK s open up early yeah seriously. To everything. Yeah Chris yeah. Yeah what times. Seven yeah. Hosting an open house. I forgot about seven thirty so can pick them up. Do have to you. My pal you know the drill. You sign up for it. She signed me up. Prompting panic selling that's disgusting. Up. With wall street. Discuss what are. My case we gotta go. Hey could kill know for every. Watergate. Have a good one. It takes dense populations to have a pandemic so of course cities will be the most vulnerable. In two thousand and seven more than half of the world's population for the first time in human history lived in cities. Transmissibility depends on the person to person contact grow very close proximity. And we've got that. Of he had seven okay got. Given the amount of global networking you can spread of disease these days in a matter of hours and days. It would be here and be among as a for we'd have a chance to react. Morning. Yeah this guy straw and fifteen minutes late. Sorry about that it's not good if people have been warned. A few times before. Then the level of sensible reaction goes down did you see that stuff on the news last night you know this virus over and Asia. Gimme a break swine flu mad cow disease avian flu smartish nada you know what mean. Let's go. I. Made me take a lot of shaking people by the collective lapels to say look all those previous mr he has been really come to anything that this is the big one. I take very good care of you here are in the early stages we haven't got a clue what it is of course. Or Wanted we do that person who's suffering from an unknown rest of the disease we're going to get them specialists you get it right away we'd better put this person in the more specialist hospital in the other side of the city now to hospital now in fact that so in no time at all it's going to set up. Today alarm is growing at the global corporations may be out of control. Reports of hundreds of thousands of cases of the major cities across Europe south america Russia. As far afield the southern Africa. There certainly is the potential to develop a vaccine problem is will it be prepared to quickly and out in an environment you need to probably not. Those of us who are exposed to viruses that we haven't had a previous experience with have no immunity that far. Where you have a virus that humans have never been exposed to before the human body recognizes this as a completely new protein and then just calls in all the troops. So these victims. Essentially. Drown in hemorrhage fluid in the lungs. Initially many people might try to leave the city gave. Hey what's going on this might actually be one of the ways that the disease spread to the countryside we heading to Washington state. So we still guys little ip say. We don't have very many examples of mass migration that has gone. Peacefully. It's going to be hard for people to evacuate a small space. In a very short amount of time without there being complete chaos. In the early stages you'll still try and maintain critical services with only a small fraction of people will show up for work you will have a shortfall exactly when you mean an increase. Are you doing. Going to work. Going to work. Why are you going to work. Cause that's what do. Shouldn't you be staying home here we can see me. Honey. You in case you are going to be fine. Okay. I'll start by the store and pick up some things. I'm absolutely convinced that our medical care providers will do the best they can but they're going to be overwhelmed there's no way around that. Know he was going to a hospital. They are going to barricade the doors and say go away from the keel. Anime case but we do with them we don't have drugs and we don't have vaccine. Fred what's going on. Demand. Why. Just go to the hospital. They did what in los Angeles county we have close to ten million people. And the average bed counts sits around twenty five thousand and maybe four thousand available on any given day. In some instances of bed counts as low as several hundred. The systems close to capacity on a daily basis. Based on the magnitude of this type of them the numbers aren't good. If you take just point one percent of the entire population you're looking at close to nine or ten thousand people that could die. That's just in a general scenario you get into a scenario where seventy or eighty percent of the entire area experiencing severe or virulent pandemic strain. You're looking at numbers that are. Off the charts. I. Will healthcare providers abandon their patients you almost never see it but we did see it in sporadic cases in Katrina. Medical supplies will be a very short supply. You have Ivy's are you have. Medicines antibiotics in particular. Those things will be worth their weight in gold. If was that person would hide my special skill set. Are you adopting. I would be in such great demand. They might almost be a bounty on me sorry. Sooner or later. Every care give has to say have a family my family is at risk. Time. You get to the point where he said let's close the borders the damage is done people are sick the dead are piling up as government officials were forced to admit global efforts to control the pandemic were failing. Hospitals in los Angeles county have reported. President. Can't watch this anymore. Is now. I wouldn't get out of here. I think about going to Idaho. Sit tight for a while okay. They will recognize that their survival and well being as in their own hand. And that they might not be well prepared for it. Little more than two weeks or world have been torn apart. We were clinging to what remained of our lives. But soon the world around us would be changed forever. UK s government today admitted the global flu pandemic is no longer containable official advice remains that to prevent infection people should stay at home and avoid all unnecessary travel. As a pandemic progresses everybody's thinking it's going to pass and everything will revert back to normal but then somewhere outside of three days four days five days. The situation gets real. Susan. How are things in Idaho. Nope. No got sick in the earthquake that hit the San Francisco bay area in the nineteen eighty nine. The whole mass communication system. Just broke down. Since it mainly from overuse. Then again. It would just add to the general chaos. Hello. This is going to be affecting the police. The fire the ambulance the people look after the power supplies the people who look after the Internet service. It's not fun. It just keeps. Global Internet. Which was designed to withstand nuclear attack. Cannot withstand the failure of one of it's most important components and that is the human army of labor that keeps that network going. When the Internet fails many things that are not even obviously Internet things stop working. I Think about how much information has held on the computers and I'm not just talking about information I'm talking about the ability to run the train system flights and all that depends on the computerized control. And logistics firms years that in controlling the delivery of all kinds of other goods and services. When the wheels stopped turning in america. Production lines come to an end in a production lines come to a stop jobs come to a stop. The mother of all dominoes would be liquid fuels. Delivery of petroleum and particular once this slows down or stops then all of the other dominoes thoughtful. Eighty percent of all airports are fueled by trucks. The largest percentage of railyard your. Received their fuel by trucks. The gas station that you feel from they may receive replenishment two and three times a day. The average supermarket replenishes of every one to one of the half days so it becomes. Very problematic if the wheels on trucks don't move to expect there to be groceries when you go to buy. Most people have about three days of food in their house so if you really wanted to go to ground. You need a lot more than three days you need three months. When you no longer have the delivery of goods and services you have. Chaos you have pandemonium. A saying that were nine meals away from anarchy. Wherever you stand on gun control. There are a lot of guns out there the most recent number on firearms in america something to the tune of of one gun for every citizen in the country would not be surprised to find violent. In new Orleans it took four days for a major American city to descend into anarchy. Think that the veneer of civilization was a little bit more thick than four days. For many people the situation would be without restraint. Going to take over as much as they can in the question is who's going to stop them. As. Well we have our. Official pandemic supplies. We have a bunch of this crunchy rice stuff. That. While the pandemic relatives course. Which could be ninety days more for it very few people think are prepared to shelter in place not have to go outside for any purpose for ninety days that would take some exceptional forethought a preparation. Fighting. So many great apes have green beans. It looks like. We will be here. For more than three days. Near one hundred and two nuclear plants and he but only five thousand workers that can run in and that's. That's a kind of frightening. God. If the skilled staff took a major hit would basically be the equivalent of partially severing of or and someone's neck. I still think we should go to Idaho. What. Can be excused. Hurt me. You've seen the news. Okay. The freeways are a disaster the system starts getting thrown out of balance there's going to be a series of shut off. Yeah the TV's not working. I think that that would not go down well in terms of people's nerves. Check all the channels yeah they're dependent on information in the information caused by electronic means. See that. Weird. There's going to be a domino effect and that the powers going to cease to fly. Flashlight. When the lights go out. I don't come back on. Here we are. Really at the limits of our knowledge. The most immediate problem within cities in the aftermath of a pandemic would simply beyond buried bodies. We would have many many many times more dead than anything or system is designed to take care of. There would be thousands upon thousands of them with no organized service to remove them. All diseases eventually decline. A number of people will survive and they will be immune to it police for that that cycle. Once we decided to try and set the pandemic out. There was nothing to do but wait. After awhile the days just blurred wanting to another. You'd have to say the people. Come to realize that they live or world which the lights are never going to cut back on it. What have to be gripped by despair it's terrible to think about it. Gradually it with dawn on people that the world has changed in it isn't going to go back to the way it was before. Some people. Emotionally could never make the transition to accepting this change. They would continue to hope that their previous lives would be restored good of course they never would be. As we rely on the freezer. Before we had a cold store nobody has any more crass. Refrigerator gone off. Very few modern people. Even conceive. I can't turn on my lights my cell phone doesn't work. My DVD player my computer. Slow down. It's all right. Eu one of the things that we saw a new York city in the blackout is how quickly it's like well the sewage is gone because the electricity is off. Toilet stopped working. If there's a grid down situation to sue each com started working. How are you going to deal with sanitary issues. Clearly there would be disease coming from the lack of sanitation and this would be on top of the pandemic that already exists we ever officially. The toilet. Then she has to go. Yeah. Very. Oh also. Ran out of toilet paper so. As a new update. Fairly soon people will turn on the top and find that nothing would be coming out of it or perhaps a trickle that would that would dwindle down to nothing at all all the water is not running. I dunno what's wrong with it. Great. Okay. I'll hit up. I go down to the store. I'll try to find whatever can. Somebody's gotta have something. Okay. Okay. I think people are going to say look were hungry one way or another I've got to feed the family. The kids are starving there's no milk where am going to. The. What happens in new York city when the garbage collectors go on strike for a week. Is it the city. Very nearly shut down. Pump garbage piles in the streets rats are everywhere. The would also be corpses of cats and dogs and other animals of the people keep us pets. And the disease can simply the stench from this would be overpowering. What we see dead bodies around we we made. People may have to Bury them in the back garden. Dead bodies. Deceased remains. Have all the packages that you'd expect. I think it's safe to say that you'd want to get those remains in the ground is quickly as possible. We all know that we have. Individuals and our society who are sociopathic are predatory. Who prey on other people. And attempt to secure supplies for themselves. And you are a sight for sore. Eyes. Okay. First of all. No. No. No. You know where my kids everyone. That might. Know. He Of prisons will be affected to they will not be able to keep the criminal element inside those prisoners. That work security for a hurricane and it was very interesting to go into a Walmart. Two days after the hurricane. And see that the the store had been completely cleaned out of everything. Talking toys pet food. Clothes furniture. Everything. By the third night when people. Were out of food. Things got incredibly. Crazy in a we were hearing automatic gunfire from. All over the said. People will for together and gangs to go obtain the resources they need. If they they don't have the resources they are going to go find them they're going to go look and there are going to take. Think it'd be looking for food they're going to be looking for drugs are going to be looking for gold or silver something. That'll have some value after. Security becomes first foremost in everything. One approach is to be invisible you could do that by making the house of look as though it's already been looted. Throw a bunch of stuff out on the front lawn. To make this place to look like it's been ransacked. That gives the the the looters a message that it's already been looted. That stop Ellen. Organic. Me job it. Fabric. Gangs. Two blocks away from here okay they're going from house to house and they are looting everything. You hear me the arm but getting the house can. Just leave at. As much better to not be seen that it is to try and fight. Damn stubborn. Almost. Course. We're almost out of water and am. A massive attack. That. I know this is not an ideal situation. An ideal situation. I see we give it another week. Okay. I say we stay here say we go. What are you doing on. Those people in the house next door taking stuff. At some point in a long-term crisis the cities of uninhabitable you're going to have to leave. Train have helped us understand the veneer of society is very thin and it doesn't take much to disrupted and peel that veneer back and what you see underneath it. Is is is quite ugly. Quite nasty. Where are we going. Going on little road trip to. Were to. Well your mom's kind of partial to Idaho. After you sheltered in place for so long and and you've exhausted years food supplies. You're going to have to get out of the city and get to some other locations. There's a lot to think about allowed to plant if you're going to make that kind of a trip Casey. Yeah let me a favor get all this stuff sell the wash and put in that box right there. When people are. Feeling that their life is in jeopardy. There is a state that many people go into which we call dissociation. It's a trance like state which is a lot like being hypnotized do you think you can do me a favor. They may sit there and stare and not move and not do what they need to do to survive because you packing a suitcase full of clothes. Casey come on come on need all that stuff in that box. The bug out bag is simply something that you use when you have to leave. They also call it a good bag which stands for. G. Do you get outta dodge filing such a rush when you talk about a bug out bag you talk about what you need to carrying with you if you've got to leave you've got gotta have water water is heavy. More water than you think. So the bulk of what you're going to be carrying his water. You need some sort of portable food that can be prepared quickly and provide you with a high level of calories much like a mountaineer or an expedition to. Take. I dunno. Simple foods you know. Crackers and peanut butter simple stuff that is. Hi and carbohydrate and complex carbohydrates and protein. Was going to have some way of. Of sheltering. It'll be something simple like a poncho or a tarp. You also need some kind of security whether it's a kitchen knife or battle rifle you need something. Because you have to face the fact that there are people out there who will kill you for what it is that you have. You always want to hope in the long term things are going to come back so you need things like your bank account number and you need your passport. We tried to pretend to each other one day we'd return. Will be back but deep down think we knew we'd probably never see home again. Already figured getting to Idaho would be tough. We hadn't realized was how difficult it would be just making it out of I a. To check the freeway. Lock the doors. Freeways blah ok. We're going to try to find the next time around. Ellen. Look. I think it's the national guard. The national guard line then you. Get them down. I get everybody out. Front foot from year to get out of I a you're going to want to avoid roads are going to be choked with dead cars. Going to have to hike good fifty sixty miles. And leave the ref. You need to strip that bag down to the most important things. You have to carry minimal amount of food and be concerned with traveling light. Travelling fast. That is going to be the challenge. Main roads are a dangerous place to be because that's where. The ambushes are expecting you to walk. You're going to have to go other routes. Storm drain system in I a's extensive alright. Let's start of the bags out first sorry they've basically taken all the rivers and paved them and turn them into big channels Casey slide down all right don't want anybody twist in their ankles we got a long walk. I Take you from sector to sector more than anything else. It'll get you through the difficult points. Once you get to the Hollywood hills. There are fire roads from west Hollywood. All the way across to the ocean. People will abandon Baltimore and Washington and Pittsburgh and they'll. Come out to where they think they can. Can do better. You'd be among the hordes of people all trying to get out of the city's many of them going in the same direction and essentially stripping the countryside us that go. Refugees will literally swamp the land around los Angeles. Over there. Really safe way to travel as on foot but may not be the efficient way. It may take so long. That you just aren't going to survive you have to get into a vehicle dr Ellen. Book. If somebody in there. You guys hold up here. Alrighty then. You're going to be a little call an opportunity for. Which means that you're going to find things along the route that are going to be useful to you and you're going to take advantage of them. Around the company I'll be right back. What are you doing. Looking for Keith people tend to fear. The bodies will pass contagion on but what does he have the virus is not thought that it would be true in a flu epidemic you can't get infected from a dead body. Besides the pandemics probably burned out by now. Anybody who survived this long has probably pretty savvy. Looks like this guy that he was a bit of a cowboy this is like going from junior high school the high school from high school to college every level you have briars. The competition gets differ. Want to try to get. Started. I never done this before. I have. By this time the people who are still around are people who figured out some stuff about survival. Those two wives. Just twist them. And you know how to do that. I don't want to know. Three days after leaving I a we were finally on an open road. Heading north. About fifty miles up the road here. There's little town. Will be able to get some fuel. Can get some water. Brief moment we forgot about what still a ahead of us. Hey look. There's that town. Be about five minutes from here. Or optimism didn't last. Jesus what is this. People. In smaller communities might actually arm themselves to to to keep strangers out. I could foresee that some small communities would not want outsiders coming in for the germs bring along for the extra demand on resources that they bring along. At a what can do for you we were wondering if we could. Write better that's good that's good right where yet. We are looking to get some. Food and some water and maybe some some fuel. Sorry pal can't do it can't login nobody nobody out. Yeah got my wife and my kid in there is the scenario of a lifeboat. After a boats gone down in the the lifeboats filled to capacity and there's other people in the water. What do you do do you pick them up and kill everybody in the lifeboat to. Or you roll away. Decision you won't even know that were mad said no. Know what if hours you. Will get in your vehicle turn it around and go back the way you came. Pretty quickly. Stay here for the night. In a form close. When parents have to worry about taking care of their children. On top of taking care of themselves. That's hard that's really difficult that adds to their stress and so to some extent people are very vulnerable who have children. So many sleep. I don't think we know what to predict. About how people would respond to a realization. That no matter where go. It's dangerous. When my children my die. By the time we were a few hundred miles out of I a. For all we could tell we might have been the only people left on the planet. We still had no idea how he never make it as far as Idaho. Fact is we were already running low on food and water. The average temperature in the greater los Angeles area and a daily basis is probably between seventy five to eighty. But when you start moving people in out of the the base of the coastal area of los Angeles and start getting into the inland desert and temperatures are and the extremes of between ninety and one hundred and fifteen degrees. What are you doing. That's drinking water. Brush your teeth with this. Why. Start using your head. She told me don't care what your mother said hey you don't need to yell. Helen we only have a few bottles of water left. If you don't get water pumping through your system you're going to get dehydrated quickly. When you become dehydrated you get loud thinking confusion. We got to take the quickest route north. Through the desert. Yeah the desert. I you need to be invisible. And that means you can't take it easy path can you find yourself. I want to see if you're getting a signal. It's not going to be I'm going to follow the high ten. To the four o five and then follow that right out of town. You got. Right now. Mean either you have it or you don't don't okay don't in around trying to see if can get like okay forget. Most of the time to maintain safety and security. You're going to want to avoid. Roads. Even if they're clear. It's a dangerous place to be. What he didn't. Get to see these okay. People are capable of barbarism. Selfishness but. There are also capable of. Great generosity. Or sir. Hey. You know what happened to you. Think my context ripped off my eyes need to try. He just stay here I'll be right back all right. We see this time and time and time again. Disaster after disaster that people bind together in the face of a common enemy and help each other here have some water. We're just going to be a little shot okay. Alright. A new Orleans we saw instances of amazing altruism. At least initially just sit back but there was a limit to the generous feeling. Good luck said dual human nature of thing we want to take care of each other. But our generosity is not infinite. Obviously the seven eleven at the corner is not going to be available to you you see that. Industrial complex. The obvious places will have been destroyed or emptied out very early on in the pandemic. So you're going to be looking for the nooks and crannies that other people have overlooked. That's where they keep all the supplies or the food all the water we need to head over there. Paramedics going to be able to look at the bigger picture they're not going into situations blindly but rather with a great deal of suspicion Allen look. Is that person a threat does this street that I'm approaching present possibly a threat my family is there an escape route. Around the back. Will be right back. Things that most immediate value after a pandemic would be fuel and feed those are the to critical things. Those who did control large amounts of people become very powerful a valid. Silly to think that an organized criminal gang. Is not going to make immediate moves. Toward the resource that would make them essentially rich make them kings in a new country that you guys spare any of that the. Water or food. I really. Real. Food will the power seriously. Someone could get control of that they have an invaluable resource I've got some cash. As a good around here. Initially paper money would lose value. About that ring. Value would reside once again in precious metals. Electricity goes away and bank account money isn't there and you can even check your back and counts then you'll presumably find other forms of barter other watch. Let's take the what. Peaceful thing to do is to make your peace with the new king of the food distribution center. And the heroic thing to do maybe to start a revolution to defy him and grabbed the food away. Geneva take this. In a post collapse situation you have not only your own life that hangs in the balance you have your family's life that hangs in the balance as well. If got gotta get the hell out of here. That that slowdown. It's okay. Sorry baby. The hardest thing in the world for anybody would be to take another life. Slow down. Their first response is going to be nausea they're going to be sick know that for a fact from law enforcement officers who've been forced to kill the line of duty. They told me. That it was a life altering event. Every one of the carry those people with through the rest of their lives. That is a car coming. Get over in the ditch. You gotta go. More than anything else if you're on the road you have to have a heightened awareness. Get out. My back. One of the keys again is being invisible staying very low key staying out of sight. People will for them together and gangs to go obtain the resources they need. If they don't have the resources they are going to go find that they're going to go look and they're going to take. Every car has fifteen to twenty years a gas of it. You have a couple of five gallon cans on the roof of your su the. And every time you pass a vehicle that looks like it might have some gas at it you stop. Drain the tank. Don't even need a siphon has because just got a screwdriver and a half the punch a hole in the bottom of the gas tank a stick my bucket under it and gather that fuel and. The excellent don't care about. Destroying the tank. Took all the back. My. Took everything. At a to on the gas tank. If it's hot in this summer and you have to go through the desert you'd better hope you can get across it in a couple of days because there's not a lot of water out there. Hm. Current breadbasket of the united states the great plains the mid west and the central valley of California with no longer be as productive as they are now. Since they depend to a large extent on fossil fuels and mechanized agriculture. Big farms won't work. As Need the mechanization in a the energy you need a petroleum to make the fertilizers. All that stuff isn't there anymore. For. I can't say for certain how long we walked. We follow the road north but truth is we were lost. Pretty soon the only thing that mattered was finding a way to stay alive. Most of what is around I a as a. The key thing you're going to be looking for the road is water you can drink. Three months into a scenario like this other low lying for it's been packed. You're going to have to be very creative to come up with food you're going to have to know where to look and what kind of resources are there. Was a barrel. Come up with scholar. You're going to have to forage which is a nice word for looting. Survivors would be very desperate situation and probably most of them would starve to death within a few weeks. And. You're going to have to do things would imagine that would be very unpleasant. You're going to have to go into houses where people have died. And you going to have to see what's left what's available to you brought up. That you guys because of that shape right now. Longer the scenario stretches out. The more food becomes. Unavailable to it spoils it goes bad. Is that that in there but these crack. And. Dad. Thirsty. Don't want to even less water. It takes water to digest your food. Sell if you don't have water available then it should not be eating. You can go about thirty days without food only about three without water. Let's see what's in that fire maybe there's. Water so. About six to eight course of water a day for a personal lab but the willpower is more necessary. If someone doesn't have a will to survive the will to like at they're not going to. You'll be gathering water as well as scavenging for work. You're going to take advantage of every opportunity. High water tanks from a hotel swimming pools any place that stores water. Water. The guys go give bar. There's more shade in there. You're going to have to look at water deck normally you would look at and make an awful face of run from. You've gotta be able to disinfected. Talk. Can't drink this though. We have three choices you can treated with chemicals such as iodine or bleach which will render a biologically safe. You can filter it with water filtration system plus generally renders is biologically safe and you can boil it which will render a biologically safe. So you can to need to make fire. Batteries are still wall will disconnect the in the back and it sounds an electric current through that keeps it upsets red hot. Potential light it up. And. Casey. Open. At. Assuming that person can stay hydrated the process of starvation may take as long as fifty to sixty days before one expires. After about three days you will not affect help hunger. New basically the bodies now be getting into break down fat and muscle tissue and about the same ratio. You become more lethargic do we become more disorientated. You have highs of euphoria and then you simply do not want to eat. One of the first things to suffer or is your eyesight. That's an indication that you're actually in a really bad starvation mode. People not aware of the small world around them which couldn't back the largest food. There's plenty of insects ants Beatles which have seven times the protein content pound for pound of ground beef just don't realize that. As. One of the cross culturally constant things we see him as historical literature. Is that. Early on. In a famine. There's a great deal of outpouring of energy. Into religious ritual activity. Term unusual wanderings has been repeated a number of times and accounts of what goes on and famished populations. What you get is basically last human. Movement over the landscape and search of some kind of relief. Spread that. Get. Lay on delayed like that. Why don't we just sleep on the ground. For sleeping out there you don't want to lay right on the ground by and it's about fifty five degrees. I want to be ninety eight point six. Cases watch out for this could be snake. But how are we going to sleep on. Brink the pieces out. Going to Atlanta. I'm going to be like insulate. Insulate yourself on the ground and create a warm pocket of air around you to keep you warm at night. It's not clothing that keeps you warm or cold it's the dead air space. Battery is almost dead. Process of starvation goes slow at first ever increase the and speed until if it's our control the an evening but by repeating you will not fact survive. There's a house. Over there. It can. You can make. At. Cognitive functions of a person being able to think clearly become impaired. One it may make poor judgments and it may adversely affect one survival. I'm gonna have a look around. And under extreme duress sometimes people will look towards. Pets. As a potential source of food. One didn't say dogs and cats and many parts of Europe after world war two. They probably serve the family well for a meal. For the most part people will not eat their own pets but would have no a compulsion about in the pets of other people. He knows from accounts from Africa you'll have masses of children. Often quite as birth day and according to many us or art is. Worthless. Children of the most dangerous people am a family. Most liable to be violent most aggressive in their activity to. To get food. Requirements are walking a lot a be as high as twenty eight hundred and thirty five hundred calories a day and be able to maintain that is going to be difficult. Well since the middle nineteen seventies. That about seventy five percent of all plants are toxic and one way or another to humans. Very likely to encounter quite a few snacks so if they know how to catch a snake which isn't that difficult the as a stick. The head down. Cut off the head. It's real easy to pull skin off real easy to take the guts out if they're smaller ones who can eat the bones right along with everything else just your real good. If Commonly hear the phrase that human beings will eat everything. There simply isn't the case. Many people in fact choose not to eat and they will affect star a presented with a truck load trauma to truck will offer. Somebody like they'd just a bag will not eat it. Casey why aren't you eating. I can eat a snake. That's the only food. That we have. If you don't eat that. You're going to die. I'd rather die. What did you just say. What did you just say. He really to see that. Aren't going to keep their. Often. We're going to. Understand me that. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. As Period about eating shape into the third or even in the fourth week. Other bad things happened to the body the liver functions begin to fail the test of anxious begin to fail even though cardiac heart rate because to fail. What are you doing. Stay away from the road. Essentially we made it into a small town. We were just happy to be able to rest of for awhile. But it soon became clear. We were living in a dangerous and unpredictable new world. Managed to get to bed linens Washington drive so. Warm tonight people coming into an area would want to take advantage of those homes or apartments or whatever. That are left behind. And why not. These people had a. Interesting taste and the. I think order would be reestablished fairly quickly within towns. Around town you'd have security barriers and the limits on who comes in the more attention to that just like we do now with nations we will do more with smaller regions. Life for awhile might become. What it is like in frontier situations such as the American west in parts of the nineteenth century where authority is local authority. Can be guaranteed if there is a a local sheriff who was particularly effective. One hundred and twenty bags of white flour. Sheriff is someone with authority. Has a badge. Now what's that authority come from that authority comes from some sort of idea even the wild west that there's a guy who's there to enforce the law wouldn't it be easier if just wrote this app it'd be easier if you had a brave Terry come out we're doing this is official work. Were talking about a world in which the governmental authority itself breaks down it's not authority he has so much as the power to enforce loyalty to a question and threads guys let's get over to the storage locker. Got. Guys. Those who did control a large amounts of food and become very powerful they would become leaders by virtue of the resources that they control the resources to people need most immediately. Security is as a huge concern in the style a limited supply the not let anybody get in here we really rely on remarkably low level of security in our society and we rely on these long-term connections to punish people. And when those long term incentives are gone you'll have to pay a lot more attention to security. I have quite a bit of faith and people being able to establish some kind of community or. Lessen. It may not always be the kind of community order that we are ideologically. Attuned to are getting at the church. Both in the destructive phase and the rebuilding phase religion will be a major current. And wouldn't see any reason why that religious impulse would not reassert itself on a massive basis. Under conditions of mass disaster. I can confidently predict that many people would interpret. Such a set of the vets and religious terms. And that there would be a resurgence of. Apocalyptic from. Might be good reason to come to that conclusion. Thanks for being here. Historically we have seen some very interesting patterned after disasters dear friends. At times like these it's only natural that we ask ourselves. Why. After the nineteen o six San Francisco earthquake there were a lot of fundamentalists revivals. Why is the world changed so much we as. San Francisco was regarded as having been just justly punished. For being a city of sin listen to what the lord says in the book of job this is a kind of religious response. That sin. Is receiving. His is do. They are as stubble before the when. And weep. That the storm carry a call religious fanatics might blame the troubles. On. Mar iron knowledge as happens among the fundamentalists and many religions today what's happened is no whimsy of naked. It would be you need to find someone or something to blame. He is putting out the candles of the with the appropriate to lay what other men and those are defended them. Hair being widowed out. Those so recently. Removed from their native desert in the jungles. They are being. Old out. Perhaps they would feel chosen. They would feel some elation. Rolling away but for having survived with a lot of people haven't. We. We. Say ab... Be. An initial period. The would need to irrational. Food is perhaps kept in a community wide storehouse. With someone who makes decisions about how much of it is allocated and at what times. Terrible were tria she comes to mind and that is making decisions as to who get the food. Under what circumstances and whether or not there be an obligation for act activities for that food food reward programs for example. So. Does anybody around here know what's going on around the country secretary of. Will there be room or in this last connected world yes or just wondering if you had any news about what's going on around the rest of the country. However do think that you're going to see global communication of a sword think shortwave communication and ham radio communication will survive get am radio station. Are able to get news all over the country. Listen to do a lot of news down south back east. Sounds like pretty bad stuff Shepherd they're talking about another civil war breaking out. Amateur radio facial that it does not need. Any infrastructure so. Anybody can be on the air he could scan for. Other conversations or just broadcast down the blind. Let's give it a shot. This is deputy Terry. Huntsville the a police department. The. Airway. Hello. Things like up there. Are not to get. That sounds like it is here. We will be living by our wits and buried trying conditions are trying to keep ourselves together when they're I'm writing. Gangs trying to take whatever a little bit we've managed him to get area. It could be. Pretty great in. All right. That. Was just stay here. I can imagine if you're caught stealing or looting. You get shot on the spot. You have the wrong town. Way you would call the. Instantaneous application of. Of deadly justice. We figured there had to be somewhere better to build a new life. First opportunity we got we decided. We like to think that moral progress has made us nice people. We've heard that our distant ancestors were mean and cruel and. Ruthless and. We can't imagine that we would be such. Were nice mainly because we're rich and comfortable oh. And where we're no longer rich and comfortable we won't be as nice. In the end we made it to Idaho. As spring slowly turned to summer. Life started to feel normal again. But it was a world away from the life we note in I a. If towns are abandoned because of a pandemic there'll be repopulated according to various criteria. Irrigation in the past has been a basis for organized some communities. Would become so again. Water would drive people to the northwest. Or maybe even. Out to the eastern seaboard. It would be kind of like. Eighteen hundreds america rural america going back to that period. I. You might have very limited healthcare services. They might go back to a system that we had in say the early twentieth century like a family doctor practice taking patients within their. Household setting it well. Trained as a paramedic not really a doctor. But I'm pretty confident just got a cold it's going to go back to the very basics dislike it wasn't a civil war. They think in the seventeen hundreds eighteen hundreds. People were more Hardy because they had to be do you have any aspect of painkillers yeah we kind of went through that stuff a couple of months ago. Today in modern society we've we've become accustomed to instant. Pain relief we can take these Bentley's. That should clear up your congestion we'd have to go back to the home remedies that we had many years ago all right let me know how they work okay. Alright thanks a lot. If. You're going to have to learn skills. That their grandparents would have taken for granted. And that's going to be a very hard way to live you making. The to. Case it. And in the garden. One does not walk into a patch of dirt interest some scenes and six weeks later harvest meal of. What do you think not too bad huh. I'm into our carrots learning how to grow food is a process that takes people entire lifetimes to learn. We can use a little help with that. More like a lot. Hey Chris. You have to grow an awful lot of food that becomes ripe at the same time. That means you have to have patient food preservation techniques that maybe the community may not know it at first. Dehydrating and pickling are both. Ways to preserve food that require very little energy and store food for very long time. Do we have to work all day. All day. Creativity is certainly high in the list. Retrofitting some things for instance a car. Car makes a really good. Solar dehydrator. Alan can you give me a cup. What happened. Interesting. I'm. Not certain. You can perhaps compared to. Some of the early English settlers on the east coast of the united states who had years of famine when they first got here because they had to learn how to farm. Under new conditions. In order to grow food when would probably jumped back to the eighteen fifty is eighteen sixties and term terms of technology where. We would be news and more human power more animal power. To grow food but it'll be a radical change. Key economic insight is that. When chain things change a lot what we all need to do as a doubt with the only to find a new job. People who actually know how to go guard. Be far more valuable than someone who knows how to trade on the stock market. A man who is working really hard all day everyday requires about three thousand calories a day. You were going to have to grow things that are starchy you're going to need the root vegetables potatoes come to mind turnips beets carrots. Year on. Food supplies that had been in storage would be gone. They'd have to learn how to cooperate. They'd have to learn how to share. Only things that you could transport knowing distances overland would be very high value goods. These might perhaps be weapons other things people consider to be of high value in these circumstances. We got some the finest every ever going to find. Of the big careers will be and salvage people who go out and a visit communities that it had been decimated and they bring back the stuff. After a while local communities would probably establish their own currencies based in paper. We might see something like a los Angeles dollar in the San Fernando valley dollar there would be all of these local currency is emerging. Naughty. Hi. You guys have any and antibiotics and. I'm sorry. Guy used up. Word out in the south it's using up all the medical supplies. When you'll be. Back up backup. That three her for a few weeks we gotta go down the. Yard or something. I'll be fine. Thanks. Without the medicines that we live on today we would go back to the mortality rates that we saw in the seventeen hundreds eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds. Even a scratch could be contacted and cause problems. Bed certainly could happen if we didn't have access to antibiotics. At it barely been ten years since we left I a. But it felt like a lifetime ago. Finally we built in his life for ourselves. And although the days required. For awhile can honestly say we were content. But that happiness was to be short lived. He's gotten the text minutes cut. I could picture a feast for everyone comes together you'll see a lot of things on the table that were gathered from the wild mushrooms and and queens. There may be bright but it might not be we read it might be cornbread and it might be heavier in denser than you're used to. There might be meet but it might well be. Poultry and you might not get much of it. Have you guys spend through really. Been through I a. As what about a month ago. Have to shoot away and shoot around it's not worth it anymore. The Walmart sometimes. Go in there to clean right. The opponent more time go figure that. Going to do with it can either. Celebrate. The a home remodel. Alright. Folks not throw a party yeah. I am certain that one of the first things that will evolve. Is a way to make alcohol or. Historically we've come together around sharing a drink and think will continue to do that. We raise our glasses these find people that have. Shown their. Hospitality. Or life expectancies have increased dramatically in the last. Couple of hundred years. We've benefited from the diet and lifestyle. Without modern medicine we go back to the scenarios. When people got a small cut. It became inflamed developed a minor infection. It spread to the body and the body became toxic as a result. Little that there's good people left in this world. Reason something worth fighting for. God bless y'all. Breath. Doing can you hear me. People will die they will die earlier. They will die from things that they didn't die from twenty years ago or ten years ago. And we will have to come to terms with that. There's nothing more terrifying than the complete finality of death. After dad passed away. I found myself questioning my own life. Endlessly replaying events. Seriously. Everything. Yeah. I wondered if somehow could have made things turn out differently. Been times in the period of mankind were we we've gotten down to really scarily few numbers and we still managed to survive. Was a time. When. The earth. Had only ten percent. Of the population that it now has. And it was. There were setbacks but generally thrived are we will be here today. In many ways it would not be an undesirable way of life. Many people today aspire to a simpler way of life and this is what it would be. As. You imagine that some of these old technologies that are immediate forebears. Developed. Would come back. That but surely there would be. More ingenious then somebody in the eighteen twenty. Twenty five years on we would have a new generation for him the new way of life as normal. Education would simplify knowledge will become practical. There will remain an institutionalized form of memory. The books didn't get sick. There's a stock of knowledge and are survivors could go back to. United states still exist in twenty five years. It's interesting to remember that after the collapse of the Roman empire for awhile people in western Europe still thought they were in the Roman empire. It continued to exist as a myth. An ideal as a story and think that's what would happen with us that we will develop a myth of the last golden age. But it would be a myth. I don't imagine that the big cities ever work again. As the infrastructure decays. It's not clear how it could be repaired or replaced. Once the train stop. Once the refinery stop. How to get them to again. Remember the universities have been decimated all around the world. Who is going to make new nuclear engineers. It's a very bleak prospects. Something positive emerge out of a collapse the positive things don't always emerge from collapses it but they can. So we would expect that ecosystems would restore themselves we would have healthier landscapes and less pollution. Loss of so many millions loss of so much culture so much community that's not good. But if you try to put yourself in the position of the. Survivors. You have to say. It's a new beginning. Maybe it's a moment. For. Star getting over. Not developed the petty jealousies. The plague us. That would be hopeful that that. That would be the future. Rather than. The one of. The mad Max and great barbarism and. Myths selfishness. That's possible but it's not the future want to play. Will be. A coward people who have survivor scouse. I can we can leaders. In that new age. What happened left its Mark on his on. That in the past. The important thing now is to look to the future. That will be look like today's society. Absolutely not. Will it be better. Neighbors. Will be worse. Let's hope we never have to find that. As. I.
