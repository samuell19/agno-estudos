English subs by Djilik Proofread by Shaunx - Hello? - Paulus? I'll put you through. - Hello? - Paulus? - Yes? - It's me, George. - Here you are! Where are you? - Just arrived at the hotel you booked for me. Good. Hurry up, we're waiting for you. - What's the address? - 119, Depot Street. 2nd, left - Far from the hotel? - No... Just walk down the stairs, take right, keep forward. Right, I'm on my way. LYON 7.00 p.m. Looking for me? Looking for me? - No, it's not me... - Who is it, then? - The guy's place you're going... - And what place am I going to? - 119, Depot Street. - We'll go together, then. You, first. Come on! Push the pile driver. What happened to you? - What does this mean? - What? This. - You keeping track of me, now? - Listen, it's not me... - Who is it, then? - Edgar. - Edgar? - The guy I told you about. - Come here, he'll explain. - No, you'll explain. Listen, Edgar is an amateur, you know. He's not used to it. He distrusts anyone, that's OK, no? You think so? Not me. Bye. - You're not leaving like this, are you? - Tell him I don't like his manners. Have you gone mad? Wait a second... Hope I don't disturb you? Already conspiring? Edgar, this is George. Hello. Hello... Please don't stay out here, come in. - He wants to go. - Go? Why? That's a nice start... Let me see. No, that's ok, not too bad. Here. You better go home, now. He's a nice guy, he works with me. Consider this: I didn't know you, I kept track of you. You can't blame me for this, let's have a drink. No thanks, I'm leaving. Wait a sec, damn it! What's the matter? Come on, just a minute. Maurice and Stephane are there, waiting for you. - Where? - Over here. - Make them wait, let's talk alone. - All right. It's a big deal, you know. A huge one. For specialists, the best. They need a leader. And according to Paulus, you're the one. That's the first time I've set up something like this. I'm an amateur, I get the gist, but mostly, I goof off. Keeping track of you, for example. Anyway, I need someone to prevents me screwing around. I don't pretend to be the boss, I'm just trying to create a team. And work with me, equally. - How many are you? - Paulus, Maurice, Stephane, you... ...and me. - It's a five guy deal? - No, you're absolutely wrong. No, these only are the managers, the team leaders. - The team what? - According to me, we should be 25, 30 guys.. - 25 or 30? - Yes. Are you mad? Why not 450?! Beyond some figure, no deal is possible. It's too risky. Listen, let's stop it here, we'll both save time. It's because you don't know my plan. Let me just tell you until the end. If you then decide we can't do it, I'll leave it. If I refund your travel expenses. Are you OK with that? And if I say your deal is hopeless? And I use it afterwards? Aren't you afraid? No. - Hey, you! - Hope you're fine? - Hey, you've grown up! - Always funny, huh? - Been a long time, hasn't it? - Five years. Five years? Hope you like beer, that's the only thing left. - What about the kids? - Still at Tolbiac, with their stepfather. I'll close the window, we can't hear ourselves. Are you all right, not too hot? There... Ah... some pins... Do you know a city called "Servage"? A small city, 26.000 people. In Is√®re. Well, it does exists. There it is. All around, here, are mountains. The city is stuck in the middle of it, the only way to go to it is there, is from the Valley of Maurienne, using the junction of road 42. You can't go beyond, it's a dead-end. Apart from this, the railway... ...that goes into a tunnel. The only business in the city is Mertens's Foil Factory. Half of the population works there. Actually, the Mertens own the whole county... The factory's there, surrounded by walls. At the entrance, a guard stands, armed, day and night. On wage days, 2 more guards close to the safe-deposit box. This is one thing. Downtown, there are two banks: General Credit and Industrial Credit, close to each other of about 50 meters, in Republic Avenue. On the right, in Theophile Mertens Street, Agricole Credit. Here is the Saving Bank, and in front, supermarket, jewelry, reception. Anyway, all the city's money concentrates in the center, so I've zoomed in here. - There it is. - There is what? According to county laws, all pubs close at midnight, so every midnight, Servage is a dead city. Except precinct, central, fire brigade, factory and guards. Wage for the factory is done every last friday of the month. The night before, there's between 40 and 50 million in the deposit-box. Within the two banks and private boxes, gold and jewels: 150 millions. Mail office, General Credit: 30 millions. What remains: jewelery, store: 30 millions. Total is: 250 millions, at least. I expect 300. I don't know what you think about it, but I like it. I think it's great. - Great? - Yes, why not think big, for once? You know, we should operate like a raid-commando. - The five of us each leads four guys. - That makes 25 guys! We fire at midnight, each team with a specific target. One for precinct, one for banks, one for the factory and so on. At 5.00 a.m., we've cleaned it all out, finished, and long gone. And 5 minutes later, all phones are blazing red! What phones? We cut the wires before we leave. What about cars? Don't they drive? Who? Postmen, cops, guards? We'll have them tied and muzzled. They can't be found out before 6 or 7.00 a.m. That makes around 2 hours in front us. From Servage to Lyon is about 100 Kms. Who long does that take for you? I do it in one hour. What do you think? - You do know these places, right? - I spent years out there. - What were you doing? - Working at the factory, as an overseer. - When did you leave? - Four years ago. - Why? - Not paid enough, I found another job. - Where? - At Berlier's, in Venissieux. I've got a month off. - How long you known him? - Since army duty. It's really true, not a joke. In Nancy. Then afterwards, of course, we lost touch. - And then what? - Well, when I was arrested... ...he learned from the newspapers, he came to see me, he helped me... ...and last month, he called me. We checked his idea from all points for two weeks, it works. Otherwise, I wouldn't make you move. But with 25 guys, that doesn't stand. - What about the deposit-box? - White building on the right, see? There's something I don't get. You were an honest overseer, I guess... - You tell me something! - So did you come up with this idea? It's not an ordinary one... - I read crime books. - Everyone has, that's not enough. I read some news about kids, holding a whole city ransom for something ridiculous. Grocery's cashier, baker's cashier, then... - Then what? - Then I got the idea. What could I expect, at best, for my whole life? Double my wage? That's nothing. This does not mean to have some money. HERE ENDS FREEDOM Factory's west wall... ....and here is the entrance. The General Credit bank, brand new... Industrial Credit bank, belongs to Mertens... - You got an account in there? - An account? Take the first on your right. You forgot that! - The hospital? - It's active at night. There are nurses and paramedics. - But they don't move until morning. - What about emergencies? Shit! What is an emergency? An ambulance and a surgeon... In any case, we'll know it with central. Best not to move then, just let things happen. I think we can do it with 12 guys. - 12 guys is just great! - But we still need to find 12 guys! - We're already four! - Five! - And three guys for the deposit-box. - Obviously. You're one. Only two more to find. And the other five guys. For others, I can check it. But deposit-boxes... Tell us about the others... - Salsa? - Salsa is OK. And there's... Combret as well. - Whooh... - What do you mean, "whooh"? - He's tough, but simple, right? - Simple, but regular. If he's simple, he'll get an easy job. Ok for Combret, then. - There's Wiss. - Wiss? I don't remember him... A short guy, working with Rotenbach. Rotenbach, yes, but Wiss, no. Rotenbach was working a long time ago with a kid called... Coletta. Well, Coletta was Wiss... Well, Wiss and Rotenbach, only two left. Including a driller. I don't know any good drillers... - What are you doing? - Have a guess. I'm gonna tell you what he's doing. If the sugar falls on the right, everything will be OK... if it falls on the left... - Well, I don't like that... - Don't worry, it'll fall right... - Come on! - Hands off! - No! - See? Falls at the right! Fucking stupid! Shit! Let me think about it. I know one who could fit: But he stopped working five years ago. - Kerini. - Oh yes, Kerini. But he won't go for it. Depends if he knows George's in. If we could meet him through his pal.... - What's his name? - Lebuisson. Lebuisson! By the way... you know him well, right? Ok, I got it. If Lebuisson's in, Keriny follows. - You got it right, in the end. - I'll try. It's not a matter of trying. Then, I think we're complete. Let me recap: Salsa... Combret... Philippe... Wiss... Rotenbach... Lebuisson... ...and Keriny. On our way back, we'll cross the Rhone river by Vienne... We'll reach Lyon by the right side, We should be in town around 6.30 a.m. We then separate, each of us takes a car. - This is the way I see it... - And what about sharing? We'll share in this place... in 12 equal parts. Got something to say? When using talkie-walkies, we'll name each other using our initials, right? Correct. - You meant, the first letter's first name? - You got it right. So here's a problem... Why? - Stephane and Salsa, that makes 2 "s". - You're right. Therefore, Salsa is "S", and Stephane is "ST". - Ok? - Fine for me. Wait a sec, at the firebrigade, what do I do? You just monitor. - Is that all? - That's all. I can handle that... Keriny, what's the matter with you? Honestly, I'm not that keen on it... You told me everything, now I'm here, I'm upset. If you told me that before, I wouldn't have come. - What do you dislike? - I don't know... Too complicated. One does this, one does that, too many moves. I'm regretting this, really. Louis, don't exaggerate, you only got the factory's deposit-box to manage... - We don't even know this deposit-box... - It's a 2-92 from '42. - Do we got any documentation? - Sure. There. - A 4 point set, you'd do it in 3 hours. - I can do better, at least. The issue's not here... There's the whole ride, before. And I'll have to carry a gun. Weapons.... You do know what I think about it. You won't have to use any weapon, just for an impression. Even that, I dislike. If you're upset, we'll do it differently. Edgar'll come with us, you stay out of town, we'll pick you up and go to the factory. Is that okay for you this way? - Could be, this way.... - Is it OK? - Ok! - Good, you'll have less movements, right? When this will occur, exactly? Between 27th and 28th, nightly. We have 2 weeks in front of us for set it all. We'll go to Servage on morning of the 27th - Hi! - Hi there! What's up? How are you? That's fine, right. Hello... - Where's Stephane? - In the truck, over here. - How's the mechanic? - Hi! - How are you? - Just fine... Ah, look on the road map. I think we should take Ostend's bridge. Down there, on the right. You're right! I'll pick up Edgar, see you later. You want to see Edgar? - Is he in? - No he's not. But come in. He'll be back in a minute. He went out for a ride. - Want something to drink, coffee? - No, that's fine. I'll leave you here, I'll get dressed and leave... Oh, he'll be upset, he told me he was waiting for someone.... ...someone important. I guess it's you. Whaouh.... it's already 10.30 a.m.! I should have left a long time ago. I fell asleep... he'll be furious. Anyway, that's the way it goes. - Looking for something? - My boots. Over there. - Is it cold outside? - Quite cold. - Tut, hope it doesn't rain? - No... but it gets cloudy. Geez, I've got no umbrella, neither. - Are you from Lyon? - No. What about you? Me? Have a guess... There, I'm ready and I leave. You better tell him you haven't seen me. Yeah, right: I'll tell him I've jumped in through the window. Yeah that's right. Tell him the door was opened. - Did you forget anything? - No, why? What about this? Isn't it for you? Thanks. - You known Edgar for a while? - Yesterday night, in a bar. ...at the "Armorial". Ah, there he is. What are you doing here? I told you to leave. Listen, I know what you're about to tell me... I've told her many times. She fell asleep, and you came early. We said 11.00 a.m., remember? - But this is not what you think. - And what do I think? I don't know: an affair with a girl to which I tell all on the pillow. - You didn't say anything? - Have you gone mad? These are not her words. - What did she say? - Everything: Servage, the day and time, the banks and guy's names. It can't be! No, it can't be! Listen George, I met her in a bar one night! It can't be! Maybe you talk in your sleep? Oh, shit... Come on... ...only joking. Just wanted to see your face. You tell me something! Only, I thought all was over. Oh you... you... Croisille and Pinsard, Croisille and Pinsard? Albert, listening. Come back to precinct. OK, we'll go to "Three Crowns" and come back. Croisille and Pinsard come back immediately. - What's going on? - Come back quickly, that's all. - Over. - OK, OK, on our way. What happens to fat one? - Let's warm the pot. - You're hungry? So what's going on? Not a move! Make a move, and you're eight times dead. Hands up! - What's your name? - Croisille. - First name? - Bernard. - What about you? - Pinsard. Ren√©. - Are these the patrol car's keys? - Yes. Right. Albert, Ren√©, Bernard, listen to me carefully: You only have to keep it quiet. Got it right? Quiet! Don't YOU move...! Now, all of you go around the counter. Come on! Lean them down. S... Come over here. - It's hot down there... - You got the vicious one? - Croisille 's dogged. - No, the snake's Albert. - Keep an eye on him. - Don't worry about him. Work with this. Not with that. Any incoming call, you answer as usual. - Right? - Right. Come on, let's hurry up. G calls ST, G calls ST. - ST. Listening. - You see the police car? Yes. Its coming towards us. - What do I do? - Nothing, I'm inside. Now precinct's done, we'll go to the fire brigade. Over. That's fine. Hands down. Keep quiet, sit down. What's your name? - My name? - Yes, first and last names. Pithivier. Arthur. How many are they in the other room, Arthur? Three. Don't move guys! Keep lying down. If you do nothing, nothing will happen to you. What if somone calls? About a fire? Don't worry Arthur. There will be no fire. I've planned it all. I'm a great wizard. All organized. - Why are you doing this? - It's a coup. You know what it is? Quiet ladies, don't yell. What's this? What does it mean? Stand up. - These are gangsters. - Gangsters? So what? If you think you would threaten me, with your guns... You can kill me, I don't care! What could you steal in here? There's nothing! Go away! You didn't get it? Stand up. What if I refuse? I shoot. - What's your name? - Lancret. Well, Mrs Lancret, please introduce your colleagues. - What you're gonna do to them? - I just asked for their names. - Jeannine Pasquini. - Thanks Jeannine. - What's your mate's name? - Marie-Ange Degand. Thanks Marie-Ange. Jeannine, take the call. Yes, I listen... No, sir, no... I wasn't sleeping. No, I swear, no! How can I help you? #27, Bellegarde? My mate? She's a bit sick today, yes... Here you are sir, connecting #27. See Mrs Lancret? Everything went well. No need for stress. Right, go downstairs to the boxes I'll join you later. Shit! This wasn't here before. Let me do it. Stand by. You know Mrs Lancret, what I would do if I was you? I'd let myself to sleep. I want you to give me all emergency numbers: Precinct, fire brigade, etc... I agree, but the list is... ...in the drawer. Don't you mind if... Marie-Ange, you dont want me thinking there's a gun in there. Go ahead. Open it. I would like #11... The precinct? There's a dial in front of you, put on a headset, and turn twice. Hello? Albert? Put me through to the guys sitting next to you. I'll put you through. Yeah? Agreed. You don't need this anymore, Albert. We settled on at central. Every call comes to us. I'll take all incoming calls. Marie-Ange? I have to listen to all calls. How can we arrange that? If you sit down here, we can do it... You have your headset, unplug this wire here... ...you put it here... You plug both red wires when the light flashes... Incoming... outgoing. You lower the lever... When the lever's down, you hear everything. There it is. - Well, here we plant. - Looks like, indeed. - Will it last long? - A long while. Then what? Is it coming? That works! Now go replace Keriny, at city entry. You warn me all oncomings and all outgoings. You: ride with Edgard and bring back Keriny. Hurry up, right? G calls ST - G calls ST. - ST, I'm listening. - Mail office is done. W is down at the deposit-box. We'll go to the factory. - You know we're not in time. - Don't worry about that. Over. You're going to steal the factory's wages! If you don't ask me questions, I'll tell you no lies. - Let's talk about you. - Me? Sure no! - Why? - I've got nothing to tell you. Yes... tell me about your home, your kids. I have no kids. A husband? You must have one. - Guess! - Then hide your ring. E calls G. E calls G. - I'm listenening. - OK, I'm at city entry. As soon as he comes in, you handle the guard. - Tell me, will they need us? - Don't worry, that's their job. If they need us, they'll warn us. What's going on? Open the door. Come on, open it! Deposit-box office. There are the guards. - Who are these ones? - I don't know. Then, what do we do? G calls E. G calls E. - E, listen. - In an office, two guys work. Shit... They must be accountants. I doubt it. One looks like a boss. There's a Facel parked in front of the office. It must be young Martens... I couldn't foresee. Anyway, we can't move in now. Can't you hold them up? No! Over. - Why can't he hold them up? - Are you stupid? These guys are not alone! If they don't come back home, the family worries, and this will turn into a mess! I have the feeling your business is gonna fail. - Will you enjoy that? - I haven't said that. Then please be kind. Don't turn down my spirit. G calls P. G calls P. P, listening. The two guys will leave now. Open the gate. Understood. I'll take over. Stand up. - Good night. - Good evening, sir. Damned! Only one goes and it's the boss. Give this to Gignou, tomorrow morning. Yes, sir. Good evening, Francois. The one left is a tall bald guy in between two old people. Do you know him? Tall? Bald? I don't know who. - It's M. Fabre! - M. Fabre? - The new chief accountant. - One of your friends? - We live by the same street. - Alone? Yes! M calls G. M calls G. G, listen. - The accountant is alone. - Sure? Sure. Over. - You're not gonna hurt hirm? - No more than you. - Jean-Paul! - Hey! - E calls G. E calls G. - G, listen. Martens went back home. Everything's OK. I'll keep an eye on the road. - You heard it, now? - Now, yes. - The accountant. - What? He's gone. He didn't return the key. Wait, I'll check it out. Hey, door's opened. Switch it on. Watch out! Nice job. You knock people out, now? Well done. G calls ST. G calls ST. - You can go now. - OK. - Switch it off. - At least! - Leave the coins! - No! Hey! We're leaving! Right! Put this in the van. - How long do you need? - Almost done. Let's go to the power supply. They're approaching the doors. - Mertens went to bed. - She better have. - It's Security glass. - Pressure point is on your right. - No, it's over there. - Let me see. - You're right, it's here. - See? ST calls G. ST calls G. - G, listen. - We're ready. Understood. - Be careful, huh? - You're afraid we trigger the alarms? You think we're gonna wake up the whole town? - Are you mad? - Wheel of fortune... G: R speaking. We're prepared. Be careful, all: 5... 4... ...3... 2...1. Hello? It's the hospital. Yes, here as well. Hold on. What do I tell them? I'm the electric company, put them through to me. I will put you through to the electric company. Hello, yes? It's a breaker failure, sir. Ah? Yes, yes... One moment, I'll check. M calls G M calls G. G, listen. Hurry up, guys. There's panic at the hospital! One guy is wired to a medical system, He's gonna die if you don't plug back him back in! G, R speaking. We're ready. ST: done. ST: done. Go ahead! Who spotted on the bank? Yeah, me. Put on drill size 30. - This time was very close to. - Were you afraid? - Sure, weren't you? - Yes. The train is on 22 minutes. Push harder! - What makes you laugh? - I think about young Mertens. What a surprise he's gonna have, tomorrow morning. I wish I could be there to see his face. You can't figure out how much I don't care. It's because you don't know him! I was raised here, I went to school here. I know, otherwise, we wouldn't be there. - Don't be upset. - I'm not upset. I mean, it's useless to think about people's faces. Think about what, then? - Don't get worked up. - I won't! - I'm just impatient. - Opening deposit-boxes takes a while. Don't worry, we'll be rich tomorrow. See you later. I don't like it when you stare at me this way. - Why? - I'm embarrassed. I look at you because you're handsome. Anyway, you're not with this stuff on! - What? - I feel suddenly depressed. Whats happened to you? When I think we could be on the beach... - ...under the sunlights... - That's an idea. On the other side, on a beach, we may never have met. What you complaining about? - I'm thirsty. - So do I. - Don't you have anything to drink? - Yes, I do have some Coke. Ah, fingerprints... Anyway, all this is simple. To tell you the truth, Marie-Ange... ...I'd love to kiss you. Sounds delicate, with this on your head. - How much time? - Seven minutes. That's fine. Ok, you're gonna push it on. - You're not ready! - We're never gonna make it! - Only five minutes left! - Come help! Push on! - It's the 2.00 a.m. train. - No kidding? Look! - What are you gonna do? - What am I gonna do? Go home! Find my glasses. - How time flies... - It's my fault. I shouldn't fall asleep. That's both our fault, you know. - We're meeting tomorrow? - Don't know, I'll call you. - I'll go downstairs with you. - No, keep sleeping, honey. You can't figure out: I work with my father at 6.00 a.m. I have a long way like hell to go. I have to close down anyway, honey. Turn around. Hush! Your jacket. Hello! Hello! Precinct, please, it's an emergency! Yes... Hello? Is this precinct? I'm calling because I think there's a bank robbery. General Credit bank... My name? Michel Castagnier. They cut off the bars! This is not a joke, I saw them and their van! I'm at Republic Avenue public phone. Right. I won't move, I'm waiting for you. Cell's keys. Come on! This way. Get inside, Michel. - Are you okay? - Every thing's fine. Go ahead! Stop it! - This time it's the one! - So much time we've spent on it! Come on, the other ones will be easier. Asshole... - There. - Not too hot? No. Still dexterous, Louis... - You bet. - You tell me something. Enough! Lord, with my colleagues near by. - They sleep. - My clip, where's my clip? There. My God, I've gone crazy. What's the matter with me? Well, sister... you always complain that nothing special happens... You got one! In a way, you're not serious in your own job! Usually I am. That's funny.... You've got a soft face. I don't even know your name. "M", it's a quite short name. Anyway, I will not forget your face soon. There's the picture in there. I could even make a identikit of it... ...for the newspapers. - That would be funny. - Your friends would be glad. - You're afraid, huh? - No. In any case, if I wanted to report you, - I wouldn't need this. - No? No. Stop it! - It's opened. - No kidding? - Want to bet? - Any bet you want. - A lunch at "Demaire's". - All right. I think about something: You didn't came here by accident. There must be a reason. Someone gave you information. Right or wrong? One of you knows the county well. The one who recognized young Mertens earlier. The same one that took the keys in the closet. The one you call.... "E". Go on. I know his voice well. He used to call his wife when he worked here. Edgar. Edgard Varini. He was overseer at factory. One day, his wife ran away with young Mertens. Three months later, young Mertens left her alone. She committed suicide. - M call G. M call G. - G, listen. - Where are you at now? - At the factory. - Could you call me by phone? - Agreed, I call you. ...18, 19, 20, 21.... ...22.... Maurice? I'm listening. - Something has happened. - What? - Edgar has been recognized. - What are you talking about? The operator recognized Edgar. - Is she near by you? - Yes. One moment. How much do you think it's gonna make? I don't know. ...34... 35... There are not many solutions. We must take her away. Right, I was thinking about this. I'll come by you later on. ...38... Marie-Ange.... We're forced to take you away with us. Take me away? ...46... 47... 48... Good, right, but let's hurry up. 48.150.000 french francs. - Hey, take it easy! - We still have some more to do. Come here, I need to talk to you. You're just in time for a help, we're too slow, much too slow! We got an issue. Edgar was recognized by the operator. God damned! We should have stolen his idea, and left him at home. Impossible! What would you do if you were me? Pal, I really don't know! Two or three days, then you'll be free. Nothing will happen to you, I'll take care of you. What about the others? - We're done. - Already? With Rotenbach, we don't lose time. That was fast. - What do we do now? - Savings Credit or supermarket. - Whatever is faster. - Supermarket. E calls G. E calls G. I listen. Some lights on the road. E calls G: three motorcycles. That's all right. A kid's band. I'll handle them. Now all listen: It's 4.00 a.m. We leave in half an hour. Over. Can't they just go to bed, these brats? Let's scare them, otherwise they'll wake up the county. Ah, sure, now here they are! Party breakers! Easy, guys... ...not too fast. - See ya, Martin! - See ya, guys! He'll go out of town, he doesn't live here. Warn Edgard. G calls E. G calls E. Call him back. G calls E. G CALLS E! What's wrong? But where the hell is he? Stay here. What are you doing here? Are you mad? - Get out of here. - Leave me alone. You others got the money, enough for you, not me. - Have you gone mad? - Go away. Go away! Go away! P calls G. P calls G. Answer! Answer me! P calls G: answer me! You all listen carefully! Repack everything now! ST calls G, ST calls G. What's going on? ST calls G. What's going on? Answer, damn it! What's going on? ST calls G: where are you? Forget us, go with others and let's meet at the city exit! Put your coat on! Your coat! Combret! This way! - Get in! What are you waiting for? - We're not all ready yet. - What's going on? - We don't know. A girl? We're not gonna bring a girl! - Yes, it's planned. - What do you mean, planned? Shut up, it does not fit the moment. Start the engine. ST, you hear me? ST, you hear me? I listen. What the hell are you doing? Why aren't you all gone? - Some are missing. - Who? - Huh? - Don't waste time: over here. Hurry up! You got it? Call the police and come back, hurry up. Stop it. Cigarette? In a mile there's a crossroad, take left. He's dead. - What does he wants? - I don't know. Go get some stones, quick. Stay here. Wait for me. Now he's dead, we don't need her anymore. We can release her. - She's in the van? - Yes. Take her in the woods, tie her at a tree, so they don't find her too soon. Give me the guns, quick. No one forgot anything? Let's go then. Come here, you've got nothing to fear. - We lead. - That's it, go. - See you tonight. - Right. Come on, hurry up! - That's for us. - No, just go by. Come on, come on! No time to waste. - Have a nice ride. - Georges, we won't wait for you? - No, go fast! - See you later. What the hell is Maurice doing? No, hide! Faster! Faster! - Accelerate! - Treadle's maximum! Turn towards the woods, we'll be safe there. Let's not stay on the road, I'll take the first exit. - Don't you go straight away? - No. Take some bough. Put the boughs on. Come on, go ahead! - Reverse! - Yeah, reverse gear! - Pull! - Push over here! - Stop it! - Put some boughs at front! Stop it! Stop it! - Go ahead! - Reverse! Push! Forget it. Forget it! - Oh, fuck! - Oh, shit... - How do we do it, now? - It's us or the cash. - We have no choice. - Oh, no, no! It's us or the money, and cops tracking our ass. - We got to go! - Are you mad? - Le's not leave that! - Paulus, listen! We got to go! Fuck, you got it? Stop it! Leave me alone! - You can't say you weren't warned! - Go the hell away! - Come on! - No, I want my share! Come on Stephane, let's go! Come on Stephane, faster! - We need to drop the bags. - No, we're gonna make it now. Come on! - We got to reach back. - Oh no, I... Yes! Come on! Come on, go. THE END
