Since Homer's time, mankind has endeavored to control wrath and violence. Laws were created, justice systems were created, prisons were created. For the duration of the imprisonment, victims and offenders now were strictly separated. We're gonna just look at what's in here. This is the south cell hall. The north cell hall is almost identical. Three hundred seventy-some inmates live in each of these areas. Are they doubled up? - Some of them are. This high-security prison in Wisconsin is one of the very few prisons worldwide that offers the victims of violence the chance to meet with violent criminals. They do not, however, meet with the perpetrators of their own cases. 1100 roughly inmates here. It's a maximum security institution. I always tell the story that in the middle of the circle is a candle. That candle was given to us by a woman, an Irish woman who works in prisons in Ireland. Her name is Anne Gallagher, and she runs a program called "The Seeds of Hope". That candle really unites us in an international way with others around the world. And I always like to point that out. When I was a judge, I remember I was sitting in felony court and I was doing homicides and sexual assaults full-time. I heard about this restorative justice thing, and victims and offenders getting together. And I thought: 'That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. I can't imagine.' It absolutely transformed me. And the talking circle is an opportunity for each of us to speak from our heart and to learn from the other. The most important thing people do in a circle is to listen to each other. Hi, my name is Bobby. I came to prison at 19 years old. I'm 43 now. I have a few years left before I go home. When I came to prison, I was an angry young man and needed help. I'd say about ten years into my incarceration in 1998, I met a man named Chaplain Jerry North from Waupan, and he told me one day in his office, he said: 'You can't keep doing the same things... the same way looking for a different result'. My name is Michael. I'm from Chicago. I grew up in Chicago. My thing was I grew up in gangs. I've been locked up most of my life. I been doing time since '84. My momma didn't have the answers. She grew up. I get my anger from my mother. I don't blame her for that but I do get my anger from my mother. She was abused as a child from her father and she displayed that. So, I grew up with that, her anger. I know I understand anger. My mother and dad both gave me unconditional love, and I think unconditional love is the one thing that I learned that I really try to pass on. My name's William Parchman. I think one of the people that put the greatest impact on my life was my older sister. It's just the matter of you waking up and deciding that change is... change is time... it's time to change. So, it had come. The positive thing my mom said to me once, last spring: 'I'm proud of you son, even though you are in prison.' I got five siblings and... I don't know. Good job. My name's Lisa. I think that the most impactful thing that ever happened to me was as a young girl. I always looked to people to see the good in them all the time. If you know people by now that can actually not be a good thing because they tend to fail you. But I didn't understand why people would fail me or why I was looking to them for something or anything. One day I came home to my father and I was like: 'Why do people keep doing things to me that I wouldn't do to them?' And my father told me: 'You have to accept people for who they are.' And after that I learned to live life a lot differently. To see people for who they are and not judge them and... it's worked out a lot better. Darryl, Darryl, Darryl. Maybe we can just get a picture, right? And put it there. Darryl was Lisa's brother, Leola's son. He was shot dead at the age of 16, near their apartment in the Bronx. A friend of Darryl's had thrown an egg ata young man from the neighborhood, which led to a fight. Almost ten years have passed since then. Yeah, I oughta get him a picture. Sentences in Norway are the opposite of those in the USA. In fact Norway has the most lenient sentencing policy in the world. Erik lost his daughter five years ago. The 16-year old Ingrid was shot in the street by her boyfriend. The two had been a couple for one year. Their families lived 300 yards apart. Ingrid had called her boyfriend from a party at their local sports club, and they had quarreled. When your daughter gets a boyfriend, you think she's safe. But she was not. When your children grow up they have their own opinion about things, and Ingrid-Elisabeth had a strong personality. It's not actually when it happened, but everything that built up to it. And I think that is not only us, but all her friends. When she talked on the phone and they heard her... what she was talking to him and that they didn't stop her. Several of her friends talked to her minutes before she was killed. One thing is, what happened in that actual situation there, but that we didn't see it coming. That we didn't understand his personality more than we did. And of course, for a father not being able to protect your child... that's an extreme situation. The dog is the last link to Ingrid in many ways. This is the picture from her confirmation. She is sitting in the front row. This was together with the dog, which was hers, Jena. We were having the same sense of humor. The feeling that you have that... you have a twin soul. And of course she also represented not only what I am, but also everything that I would like to have been. That's... because of the way she was. And of course she was also extremely competitive. And I miss her a lot. Ingrid's former boyfriend, Stian, is now in prison in another part of the country. Sometimes he is granted special permission to make internet calls. It was a sight that I will never forget. There's something special about the last breath because then... all life just disappears. You can almost... you can almost feel that the spirit leaves the body. Because... From the look of the eyes, the body... the noise of the lungs filling up for the last time. It's a sight you never can forget. What did you do next? This happened... and her eyes just rolled back in her head. Then I panicked and I tried to call Erik three or four times. Because, I don't know... I just felt that he would be the person to call first. It all just happened automatically. When I tried to call him and I tried to call the police. I just walked this yellow line in the middle of the road without thinking of anything but this last breath. That is something that has a special place in my mind. It will be there forever. Darryl was a typical Bronx teenager, and he had himself been in trouble with the law a few times. The night before, and the morning of his murder, he had not been home. He was very athletic and he could box really good. Which is probably the reason why he got killed because he had to fight. That's sad, that you can have a fight and somebody comes back and kills you. That Saturday, it was February 9th. He was going to school. So we went to Secaucus, New Jersey, to go shopping, because he wanted the Champion shirt. And I said: 'As long as you go to school, I'll get the Champion shirt.' We had an awesome day that Saturday. We shopped. We had a real good time. We came home... They was having a party downstairs for the girl that was eight years old. He was right in the hallway, and I said: 'I love you and I'm going out and take care of Lisa.' He's like: 'Ma, I got this. I got this, Ma.' Then, the next thing I know, it's the next day. This is me and Darryl opening presents. There is Darryl opening up his PlayStation. At that circle in prison you started to call the inmates gentlemen. What do you think about the man convicted for killing Darryl? I wouldn't see him changing at all, because he didn't admit to the crime and that's first and foremost. I definitely don't see how you could ever be a part of restorative justice if you're not being honest about the crime you committed. The only thing that it might have brought to me is that he was very, very angry. He had gotten robbed maybe a year before he had come into the confrontation with Darryl and wound up killing Darryl. I think, in his mind, he got a gun and he decided if anybody ever bothered him or whatever, he was gonna get that gun and he was gonna take care of business. Unfortunately Darryl had to be playing a childhood prank and hit him with an egg. Then he has a fight, goes home and he gets the gun and he comes back and kills Darryl. I don't think he's gonna ever be, I would hope and pray he would be, but I doubt it because he's cold-blooded. I don't think he would wanna be a participant of restorative justice because in his mind, there's nothing to restore because he's not guilty. "Today, RAF commando Ingrid Schubert, shot dead the secret diplomat Braunmühl, the political director of foreign affairs in Germany. Our actions target the aggressive FRG state-apparatus. It functions as the core of Western European imperial war strategy." This statement was found close to the scene of the crime. Patrick lost his father in an assassination. Gerold von Braunmühl was one of the last victims of the German militant leftwing RAF, the Red Army Faction. The senior official at the German Foreign Office, he was shot one evening in the street right in front of his house. At the time his son, Patrick, was 18. His motivation to work at the office for Foreign Affairs was his experiences in late World War Il. His family lived in what is now the Czech Republic. They were exiled and passed through reception camps. He experienced all the stress and suffering. He wrote a great examination essay that expressed early on his desire to work in foreign affairs. To prevent wars from happening again. Although almost three decades have passed, Patrick is haunted by the question of who actually killed his father and why. There's this image of my father. He wasn't much older than I am today. The last time I saw him. When he went to work and gave me a hug. When we had breakfast together for the last time. All those memories. They've remained at a standstill in a distant time. The images from the terrible crime. The insanity of the crime: getting a call at night, arriving in that brightly illuminated street, looking at the covered dead body. I obviously did not want to associate it with my father. All that terror and the days after. All that happened. It's a trauma buried deep inside. And situations like this bring it all back. Stian had confessed to shooting Ingrid with a sports pistol from his father's gun collection. As a minor, he was sentenced to nine years in prison. After a few years he was transferred to a prison in the fjord of Bergen. Common people have very... They have severe difficulties in understanding what a prison is really like. Because when you are standing outside watching this island, see sheep walking freely around, it looks like paradise in a certain way. But really it's a prison. It's the same rules. You know? The people who are standing outside and watching a prison system from a distance can't really understand the real problems. Because they just see: "You have a sofa! Oh my God, you have salmon on your table, Oh my God you have a big TV with hundreds of channels. You are allowed to have a computer and are allowed to go to the Internet." In some way that feels like a hotel compared to other countries. But... that's not what we are focused on. What is your focus? So far I never walked one single round around the island alone. I had these tensions inside me all the time, so I didn't ever relax. After four years in prison, Stian received the right to visit his family on weekends. Norwegian law permits him to leave this island every two or three months. Erik has no legal means to prevent this. The time frame is important with respect to rehabilitation. Our rehabilitation. However, that does not necessarily need to mean that the person needs to be sitting in a high-security prison. It's a need for us to feel secure, knowing that this person is somewhere else. That you don't need to look over your shoulder every time you go outside. That is the time frame of it. Not knowing how he is, not knowing his mental state, is a huge challenge. Because when you have that fear, it is not just something you put aside. The fear is there. I go in treatment, but still I can't put it aside. I don't feel secure. And that has nothing to do with whether he will... do anything to me or not. Because statistically he will not. But statistically he shouldn't have killed my daughter. But he did. I don't know when he will be out on probation. However, what they have said from the prison is that if he applies, he will be out by January 22nd, 2012. Which is six years, two-thirds of his sentence. The following spring, Lisa and Leola make another trip to Wisconsin, this time to attempt a dialogue with only one offender. With the assistance of the former State Supreme Court Judge, they meet with a man who has murdered. He has no connection with Darryl's case. Good morning. Sorry about all this. It's alright. - You doing okay? Did you sleep okay? - Absolutely. They are nervous. Are you a little nervous? - I'm pretty sure we all are. So, my role here is to support all three of you. And to help you in any way. If there is some awkward moments or difficult moments I may interject, but for the most part it's a chance for the three of you to talk. I have asked Lisa and Leola to start a little bit maybe by telling us about Darryl and taking us through what happened. If anyone needs a break, you just let me know. The day that Darryl was murdered, it was a Sunday, so we were both home and my father as well. They'd been married for twenty-six years, right? We're a pretty close-knit family. I was nine years old. My brother's friends all used to ring the doorbell. And they would be like: 'Hi, Lisa, is your brother home?' But this time his friend Rich rung the bell. He's like: 'Hi, Lisa. Is your mother home?', which really threw us off. He comes upstairs and he's shaking. 'Darryl was shot and the blood is coming out his mouth.' He stays with me and my parents run. Probably about seven o'clock my mom had called me from the hospital and had told me that he had died. I just felt like I was robbed. I was robbed and my innocence had been stolen. Because I was a baby. In my eyes, I was a baby. I didn't realize people were so evil or angry. I think that stripped it from me. From then I felt like I grew up at nine. It sounds stupid. I remember this, right? Darryl wasn't always well behaved. He wasn't a bad kid because he had excellent manners. What happened on the day he got murdered... me and Lisa were looking at TV. All of a sudden I had this vision. And I was like, damn, somebody died. The vision was gone. Three seconds later, the friend is ringing the bell. They put us in a room. It was me and my husband and Dwayne's mother and father. And some other lady was with them. I looked up and the nurse or the doctor came in and she was telling Dwayne's mother to come out. And I'm like: 'Oh, my God!' I'm like: 'Oh, my God. Is he dead?' And they were: 'Yeah, he's dead.' And I'm like: Oh my God. Everything killed him. It just felt like everything killed him. I tried so hard to fight for him, to try and save him but it wasn't even up to me. Things were still gonna happen the way they had to happened. I had no control over that. I had just turned eighteen as a matter of fact, and... I was with this one girl. I was just chilling... and I rubbed my pockets, thinking, I ain't got no money, man. I remember, and, we were just at her home, and... she was like: 'So what you gonna do?' I said: 'I'll be right back. Let me use your phone.' I hopped on her phone and I made this call to this restaurant. I make the call. I hang up the phone and I'm like, man, I'm thinking to myself, I don't even really wanna go outside. I really don't. I'm like: 'Okay, if I go over here, and this guy's not here, I'm just gonna turn around and leave.' I'm not gonna wait or nothing. When I go and I get to the yard, I see the car pull up with the restaurant sign on top. I'm like: 'All right. All right it's too late now.' I go through the yard and I turn the light off so it's dark back there. I see him come in and I pull a gun out. I tell him: 'Just drop everything. Drop the money on the ground and just leave.' And he did that. He dropped the food that he had in his hand. I couldn't see what else he was doing it was so dark, but... the gun just... it just went off. I don't know. It went off, man. 'I can't believe this happened. I can't believe this.' That's the whole... that's the only thing I'm saying. I'm down there for like two hours just sitting there by myself. I'm just thinking about everybody. My family, my daughter. And I'm like: 'Damn, did this just happen?' You don't remember your finger touching the gun or nothing? No, I don't. I didn't have my finger on the trigger or nothing like that. Because my intention going there wasn't to shoot nobody. The gun just went off? - Yeah. Maybe you hit it or something and it came out? Absolutely not. I didn't do none of that. The judge gave me sixty-five years. I been down fifteen years now and... I'm thirty three. And it's like... The hardest part for me is I had to watch my daughter grow up in prison. When she would come see me, she would just look at me like... And I could tell what was on her mind but she just didn't know how to say it. From day one, when I found out and everything like that, I've been trying to fight for Darryl's memory and stuff because he's my only son. I can almost identify with your daughter. It's just on the other foot. You in here. She out there. My baby dead. It's the people like us that gotta live with that every day. If you do get somebody to man up and say: 'I'm sorry!' or be remorseful or talk to the people, that makes it a little better. At least you talked in the court. He said nothing. He was cold as ice. It's like as if he just took his self out. His body was just there. If you don't mind me asking, what would you tell him? What would you say to him? The first thing would probably be: 'What took you so long to get to this point in your life?' That would be my first question. 'After you killed my brother, why did it take you this long for you to admit to doing it?' What can I do not to allow somebody else to ever do this again? Like, where did this anger come from? 'Cause it wasn't just from my brother. It's no way in hell somebody... A little fist fight and now you wanna come back and kill everybody? It's deep. So, where did this come from? I'll be having a world of questions for him. There's absolute incomprehension. The feeling of many questions unanswered. And on the other hand you learn to live without answers to the many questions. But it is a very unhappy situation. A murder happened, and to this day, you still don't know anything. You don't know who, you don't know why. You don't know what was discussed in that group. How they chose their victims. This feeling is deeply unsatisfying. After the attack, Patrick and his family took an extraordinary step, attempting to communicate with the RAF killers through a daily newspaper. They got no response. Seven years later, the RAF member Birgit Hogefeld was arrested. She was never accused of the Braunmühl assassination. But at the time she had been in the inner circle of the RAF. Therefore Patrick and his family wanted to talk with her, and they had a meeting in prison. I could imagine it quite well. The meeting is long ago. 1996, nearly 20 years ago. Obviously life went on. After such a long period, I would expect to be able to have... a frank talk about it. I'd like to learn more about it. I know that at the time I was fairly reserved and tense, I thought: did she hold the gun? Am I sitting opposite the murderer or not? I asked her how the RAF chose their victims. Again, her answer... She didn't want to... She didn't want to discuss it in relation to my father. She only mentioned how... how abstract... selections had been. She also admitted they didn't pay much attention to the people in question and weren't interested in them. They were looking for individuals who could be portrayed as evil. Representatives of the imperialistic state. But they never actually asked what these people thought or what wrongs they actually committed. That was less relevant. Birgit Hogefeld was released from prison after 20 years. Do you think she's willing to speak to you? The prerequisites for her... talking to you or me is she herself being interested for her own sake... in processing the matter; that she still considers it a matter of importance... and views dialogue as an opportunity to move forward herself. Erik's family received a letter from Stian in prison. His ten handwritten pages explain the crime in detail and intended to ease their fear about him visiting the town. But actually, Erik's family became deeply troubled. They felt that the Norwegian state was failing to protect them. We... made the final decision in two thousand and... We moved here in 2010. Two years ago. The 15th of December, 2010. We didn't have any trust in that he would do anything but moving home. And that was the only indication we got. So it kind of came from that. At that point you can't just wait and suddenly you get into a forced situation. The grief we feel for the loss of Ingrid-Elisabeth does not mean that we love you less. That's for sure. But of course one of the biggest fears is that you see if your other children are suffering, but... you cannot do anything with it. But did you see that? - Yes. And... I think we saw that. Because... I think I actually did, but that was... more from mum than you. It's now that I feel I started to look over my shoulder when I'm... After he got out of prison. I think that was when I started to look over my shoulder. Yes. - Not before. -No. When I see someone who in my imagination looks like him... I don't have those. ... then I'm really focusing and looking hard and kind of making sure it's not him coming towards me or coming up behind me. That's the only thing where I have to... to make sure that I am in control. I don't think I remember what he looks like anymore. I only remember his little brother. You think he looks similar? I think his little brother looks similar. If they don't want anything to do with me and they don't wish to see me, I'm going to do my best trying to be a ghost among people when I am home. I still send my little brother to the store if I want ice cream or soda or whatever. He thought that I was lazy and that I wouldn't use my own money. And I grabbed him and said: 'Listen, this has nothing to do with laziness.' And I, personally I have... nothing to fear to go to the store to buy what I want: Nine of ten times it will be going okay. But the one time it won't go okay, and then I have failed. After shooting Ingrid, Stian wanted to kill himself. It was only after his parents visited him in custody that he started to feel like a human being again and a part of a family. Since Stian's release from prison, he has been studying far from home. However he visits his parents regularly in Hommersåk and is worried that he will run into a Berg Family member. I also have friends living there, in Sandnes, in their new apartment, but I've never been there to visit them, just because I know the Berg Family lives there. I have never placed my foot in the graveyard. And I don't allow myself to do so because I respect the people who might come and visit Ingrid-Elisabeth's grave and who don't want to see me. The whole prison stay isn't a punishment. The only punishment you can get is what you give to yourself, because at the time you start thinking... when you start to reflect on what you did, that's the real punishment. The punishment is not to be locked up in a small box with nothing but yourself. The real punishment is what you make for yourself. We are at Elverum Volke High School. You choose this school 400 miles away from home? I think it's... because of my sister's murderer. He is close to home. Even if he's in Kristiansand or wherever he was. He can still come home and... I thought that if I'm far away, the chance of meeting him is smaller. I close myself off from everyone and live very much by myself. I think I have a difficulty to get... to get to know boys. That's something I just have to get past. Not everyone is like... that guy. Patrick's wish for another encounter with Birgit Hogefeld does not take place. She doesn't want to meet him. The RAF group became militant in the aftermath of the student protests of 1968. One of the RAF's last surviving founding members lives in Berlin. Manfred was a close associate of Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin. Here, around the Technical University, was where I was with Petra Schelm. This was our district. We lived here on Bleibtreustrasse. There was a huge demonstration here and she was almost run down by a police car. What were you demonstrating against? I think it was the American invasion of Cambodia. That was when things changed. Afterwards we were sick of peaceful demonstrations and decided to arm ourselves. The Federal Republic of Germany responded to the RAF attacks of the early 70's with the biggest manhunts in its history. When I was convicted, it was to life plus 10 years, yes, that was what one had to expect. Manfred was the RAF's forger. In 1972 he turned a Hamburg apartment into his workshop. The thing was the tenant of that apartment, Weisbecker, Thomas Weisbecker, he was shot dead at noon at a bus stop in Augsburg. Straight to the heart. By some police officer. I thought, shit: that apartment's too hot! Before that we'd never have re-entered it. But these valuable machines were in there. Mainly that repro device. it took us ages to organize it. You couldn't just buy it anywhere. Documents, passports and photos, basically my complete darkroom. I arrived, it was winter, March, I don't know... snow on the ground. I walk in... in front of me is a comrade who didn't know the apartment... I was wearing a thick winter coat like a parka with lambskin. In my right hand the keys and in my left a briefcase. Inside was a machine gun. We wanted to get the forgery equipment out as fast as possible. That's why we came with a VW bus. I open the door and my comrade walks ahead. I reach for the light switch and instantly the shooting begins. They had already been there for five or six hours. Three of them, as far as I know. I dropped to the floor, drew, and shot back. All of this was in the dark. So anyway... Right, it was murder. Sure... You can't claim self-defense. No two ways about it. In America they'd have given me the electric chair. No two ways about that, either. The police chief investigator died in the hospital. Manfred recovered from his nearly fatal gunshot wounds. Miss Berg? - Ah, it is me now. I've had an indescribable good time in this class, and... Well, I had so many good experiences, I can't describe it. And the best teacher I've ever had. At the beginning, I mean for probably six to seven months or something, I was living a nightmare. It was like I was living in a nightmare. And I really had to struggle to wake up. At the same time I was suicidal. I was thinking about ending it all. I still have nightmares. Not about the actual scene, but more like that I'm with her. I'm dreaming of the good memories and when I wake up, it's very sad to wake up and realize the fact that she's not here anymore. I start to feel that if there had been any chance in the world, I would very much trade her place with mine. The bomb blew up when Ingrid called me for the third time the evening I had gone home, brushed my teeth and gone to bed. She said: 'You know very well if you are not around, someone else is, and you know very well who this person is.' And she was referring to this person. I turned off my phone and I just thought, good night and tomorrow is a new day. And she called again and she said that they were finished with the first round and that they were on their way up to the second floor. Where the couches are, where people meet on a big table. And she was telling me in detail what they were supposed to do sexually. And then I just threw my phone against the wall. And she did call up the third and last time on the house phone. She went further and deeper into these sexual details describing of what they did and whatever... and it just exploded in my head. My intention was only to scare, to make fear. In the trial for Darryl's murder, Sean was not willing to take full responsibility, and denied being the gunman. If he now admitted his full role in the crime, Lisa and Leola would not get to know this. In the USA prisoners are forbidden to directly contact their victims' family. Why would I want to talk to the perpetrator? Well, it's been almost eleven years. I'm pretty sure he regrets it because his behind is in jail. When I asked you shall I contact him, you agreed. So I did it. And I wrote him a long letter. And I told him about the project and about you. To him?-Yes. - Did he write you back?-Yes. He wrote me back. - He wrote you back? Yes. - What did he say? I didn't even know he was capable of writing. Now you understand how low my standards are for him. Did you tell us that before? That he wrote you back? Oh that's all he wrote? Let me see, Lisa. He said he is willing to do it. He's a liar. Wow, this is crazy. This is from Sean Green. Friday, April 22nd, 2011. "Hello and good day to you. I'm writing to you in regards to Mr. Siegert's letter I received on 4/21/11. However, I am willing to be interviewed and to discuss participation in Mr. Siegert's film. Sincerely, Sean Green" I seen that. I read it. At least he can write. Yeah, in script too. He signed his name. Yeah. - Well, that says something. He got an education from New York. That's what it says. I guess... Some month later, Manfred suddenly mentions that after his 19-year prison sentence, he had intended to contact the family of the police officer he had killed. I wanted to put things straight. I really thought: I'd shot down a family man, you know? With kids my age or younger... And I thought I get out after 18 years... and offer an apology to the victim's family. I wanted to explain how it all happened. I was uncertain of the outcome. I wanted... Maybe my wish wasn't strong enough. It all went different than expected. She prevented me, with her statements towards the Bild newspaper, you know, tabloid press. They like to up the ante. I still have the copy. 'The murderer of my husband has been pardoned. I cannot imagine why.' For me, that was that. I decided not to go there. I mean... I talked to my prison pastor Hubertus Jansen. He was prepared to be an intermediary to set the thing up... I asked him to help me. For us her actions were like closing the gates. I didn't see any possibility. What would that meeting have meant to you? You can't negate what has happened. But, maybe... if a meeting were to come about... in some shape or form... I could imagine... that afterwards... both parties would be able to let go of that which is haunting them. A kind of mutual closure. Everyone had his reasons. It happened the way it did. I couldn't prevent it. Neither could she. Life goes on. Well... To put an end to this victim-perpetrator bullshit. Stian's letter to Erik's family led to their total rejection of him. When Erik himself later asked for a meeting in prison, Stian was advised not to do it. Due to his regular visits to Hommersåk, public and media backlash was already too intense. The Norwegian justice system did not attempt to mediate between the two sides. I would gladly take some of their burden if I could. I can never tell him that I'm sorry for what I did, because the word isn't strong enough. 'Sorry that I killed your daughter' would just make it worse. For him? - Yes. I believe so. Because there are no words. There do not exist any words that describe how sorry you really are for what you did. What would you have expected from that meeting? Do you want to give or to get? Both. What do you want to give? I want to give me as the person to blame being there. I'm just free to point at and shoot at. Just bring everything, expressions and hate and whatever. The eyes always tell a different story than the words. If I can receive that message, maybe I will change my mind totally. Just decide never to place my foot in Rogaland. There is something with the eyes of living creatures that can tell a different story. The eyes always tell a different story than the words. If I can receive that message, maybe I will change my mind totally. Just decide never to place my foot in Rogaland. If he could understand that I don't have any words to describe my feelings for his loss. If he can understand that, then I have managed to... to send out my message to him. That I am sorry. Of course it would be unpleasant to meet him. He murdered my daughter. Of course it would be unpleasant. Lisa and Leola have asked the New York Department of Correction for a victim-offender-dialogue with Sean. The department denied the dialogue because Sean has continued to assert his innocence. Sean has now exhausted all legal options. He says it is important for him to defend his position on film. We migrated from Jamaica in the West Indies to come to America. It was my mother really. She wanted to come up. I didn't personally want to come to America yet. Because I wanted to finish high school down there first. Then I would have moved to Jamaica Queens, New York City with my grandmother, aunts and other cousins. Stuff like that. They enrolled me into Richmond Hill High School in Queens, New York, - which - I wanted to go to a different school but they said it was my zone school. I was fifteen years old when I left Jamaica to come up here to live in the US. Sean, tell us about your punishment. I have a forty-years-to-life sentence. I have been incarcerated for more than eleven years now. It's difficult, some people they say it happens for a reason, but spiritually it's not comfortable to me because this is not where I want to be. This is a place that I don't want because this is an unnatural environment. If you're not mentally strong enough, it will drive you crazy. This is why sometimes some people hang themselves. In his case file, Sean has a copy of the surveillance video from the crime scene. He claims he was not there for the shooting. February 10th, 2002. When I walked into the bodega and approached him. I said: 'Listen! Why did you hit me with eggs?' He said he doesn't know what I'm talking about. The fatal victim in this incident comes over there. He asks me what the problem is. I said: 'No, there's no problem.' When Darryl, the deceased, asked the non-fatal one, Dwayne, if there was a problem, he said: 'No, there's not a problem.' I said: 'Okay, it's not a problem.' And then I left the store. I've always been the first to try to walk away from an incident because I believe it's the right thing to do, to avoid a situation. This is what I've been doing so this is why it's so stressful to me, because I've been doing this all my life to avoid problems. Problems always seem to come my way and then situations happen. I feel that I was wrongfully convicted and targeted because there was nothing that proves that I'm the one that really did the crime. I don't believe it's a good idea to meet with the deceased's family because I said the closure they're trying to find is not what they could get from me. I can't give them what they want. I am sitting in my car not doing anything. But he takes the gun I wanna tell you, I don't care if it was a real gun or a loaded gun, a BB gun or a fake gun altogether. The impact on the other side is exactly the same. The harm is exactly, a hundred percent the same. He takes the gun and he cracks me three times upside the head in the same spot. It probably went something like this, you know, but in my mind it was like a million years in between. After the first time these exact words popped into my head: 'Just take it.' And then he ran off, and I was just left there. I wanted to know who in God's name would ever do that to another human being. I had to be able to look somebody in the eye and know who would ever do that to another human being. Every six month, the former State Supreme Court Judge organizes this circle of restorative justice. Each time, new prisoners and new crime victims can participate. Tanya, I'm in prison for armed robbery. Since you told your story, I thought, it's not the stuff that you physically take away but the stuff that you emotionally and spiritually take away. Because that stuff can never, ever be replaced... and I'm sorry for taking the stuff that can't be replaced... way more than I'm sorry for taking the stuff that can. Thank you. This is one of those moments that I feel well, I feel terrified. The reason is, when I hear stories like this, it brings me back to all the people that I have harmed. Over the past few years... I always thought when I first got incarcerated that I only had one victim and that was the person that I shot. But... after so many years, I started realizing that I have had countless victims. From his own police... coworkers, everybody in the city, county, neighboring cities. I took the security away from a whole city. And it's... It's something that I'm never gonna be able to make amends for. But I know stuff like this, this right here, is the only honorable thing that I can do. It is too late, actually. It is too late. During the last month the final decision was taken. I can't just say, there was a date or whatever. But I still considered sending him a message up to a week ago. Or maybe less. I don't want to risk where I am today. And I don't need to have the disappointment. Now that I've decided not to meet him... it is a decision that I have to close the door. And if I were going to send him a message, I couldn't close that door. I would still have been waiting on some reaction. I think that at some point that process would have been good, but it's too late to put it in now, and as long as I don't have anything to gain from it, I can't do it. Erik says he doesn't care whether Stian sees footage of him or not. But Stian attaches importance to it, wanted to learn how Erik responds to his readiness for a meeting. When this opportunity came, that I could meet Ingrid-Elizabeth's murderer, I had to realize and think how would that affect me... what would that do for me. And then I finally got to the decision that he had nothing to contribute. That was a step in removing him from me. And that was very important, and actually a relief. That was a relief. To me this project has meant a moving forward more than I had been able to with any of the other things I've done or help I've had. So that's why it's a relief. Of course I was furious. I was angry at a group I didn't know much about. I often wondered in my fantasies: What if I had been with him? Could we have fought them back? There is still a lot of anger to this day. But nobody to address. Was your father armed? Never. He didn't even have an official car that day. As a diplomat I thought maybe... - No! He went innocently home by taxi. He didn't want to have the official car wait. And this soft spot was used against him. They must have listened to the taxi radio, waited for him at the front door and just run at him with the gun and shot him. As I say, it was never... the intention of the original RAF to just kill people, politicians, whatever... people... To just shoot them down like that. I would also be deeply frustrated and hurt. To you it's a cut-and-dried thing that those people were allied to the RAF? You have to assume it, given the letter claiming responsibility. A letter claiming responsibility... - Everything else is uncertain. Forging was my profession. I could easily forge such a letter. The very fact that it's... How long is it? Ten pages... that says it all. Apparently typed with the same machine as the one used for the letter... - Ah! It's from back then. - ... relating to Schleyer's kidnapping. I am one of the founding members of the RAF. First generation, and in this regard I feel responsible for everything that happened in the name of the RAF. But also... There was some kind of... mutual agreement not to incriminate anybody... and therefore also not... to contribute to resolution for this reason. That was the general agreement, and nearly everyone kept their word: Not to blabber to the authorities. I can't say if this still concerns surviving convicts or ex-convicts. They alone know that. So the question becomes, why would they now talk about it? To retrospectively incriminate themselves or others? Because it's what a plausible renunciation involves. Murder has no statute of limitations. The way I see it, solving the crime won't bring the victims back to life. But it's a requirement that should be taken seriously. And also by those who say: 'Maybe all this was wrong.' It would be a small contribution by way of responding to this need to know more about what occurred. But if... But if someone comes along now and says, it was me who did it, he will go to jail for life. Without any chance of a pardon. So that... That's something... Without the testimonies of group-members, there isn't much hope, anyway. - If they did exist... these offenders... Assuming they come from this environment, they would have to be given an offer. Immunity from prosecution. - Maybe... There would have to be an offer. What chances do you see for the resolution of these 3rd generation RAF incidents about which we know so little? I have the feeling there is a pact of silence between officials and offenders. To my knowledge, ex-RAF convicts have never felt the need to again have a sit-down and come up with a political analysis that is actually comprehensible. One in which, maybe, I don't know, compromises would be demanded from the state. By way of de-escalation. My girlfriend, Petra Schelm, was shot on the run... in Hamburg. There was this raid for BMW cars. Police locked everything down. Unluckily, Petra was traveling in a BMW. There was a new comrade with her. A policeman at a barrier asked her to stop, she tried to skirt around it. Then came the helicopters, and they both jumped out of the car and ran in different directions. She ran through this backyard... and was shot in the back of the head. My whole world collapsed. I thought, how can life carry on at all? Of course I was furious. After that I was always armed. It always... escalates like that. A spiral of violence. In the end, Patrick and Manfred have the impression that it would make sense to get other RAF victims and perpetrators together as they have done. The tape is very fuzzy and grainy. The shooter has on a hoodie over his head. I've seen the tape and it's nota clear tape. That's him getting a soda. He walks the same damned way. Ma, you saw that? For Darryl's family, the deceased, they have a great loss. So I feel for them but there's nothing I could do about it. Admit it! That's all, just admit it. You need to admit it. I don't care how much forgiveness you're supposed to have for a person. I don't think I could forgive him that much. I could forgive him enough so I could lead my life, but other than that, uh-uh. I'm glad he's not out. I'm glad they don't have that system like they got in Norway. It would really hurt me to know that he could come out of jail because it's a holiday to be with his family. Meanwhile, I have to go to the grave to be with my child. That's not right. I don't know who made that law over there. I thank God they don't do it here. You heard him say: 'He wouldn't wanna be here. Jail is no place to be.' Okay, but he deserves to be in hell. He doesn't only deserves to be in jail. He deserves to be in hell. That's what he deserves. That would be a fitting punishment to know that he's going to hell for the rest of his life. That's what I would want to know. - Mom, turn it down. The rice is not in here yet, Lisa. The water has to boil. Yeah, that's what I would wish. Yeah. This is what it is. As far as being a victim and a survivor. Everything is always conflicting. One minute you're a victim and one minute you're a survivor. One minute you understand how he could do it and the other you hate him. The one minute you wanna forgive him, the one minute you never want to. You're always in this constant battle trying to understand it. I, as a person, have to constantly feel like this conflicting feeling. I don't want to hate anybody. I swear. I don't want to hate anybody. You pray that you're able to forgive somebody after they hurt you because you have to carry around this heaviness. So, you want to forgive the person as much as you want to. You want to, from the bottom of the heart you want to. But then it's like you're fighting yourself. Because it's like, if you forgive him, do you not love your brother anymore? You feel like... You're just letting it go, like, he's dead, now you've forgiven that person and now you move on. But does forgiving him mean like you say it was okay to kill my brother? Because in a way that's what forgiveness says. And it's hard to say that. It's hard. It's so hard to just say: 'Oh, I forgive you.' I forgive you for what? For killing my brother? I don't forgive you. I don't. I don't know how to. It's okay to step on my shoe, but it's not okay to kill somebody. It's not. And for them to never live again. Erik is now living on his own in the new house. He is considering selling the house and working abroad for a while. I think the loss and the grief... That will never go away. It can get more distant, but it will never go away. I had a picture once out at the graveyard where there is a mountain behind it. I felt that she was sitting on top viewing everything. That's a picture I have in my head. You heard her say anything? No. I'm embarrassed because of who I am and how I might think that they will see me... as a murderer, as a cold-blooded killer. Maybe deep, deep inside I will also have the same thought about myself. And I hope if there will be a situation where we might stumble upon each other and that I will await eye contact that he will know I will await it because I'm the person who is scared and embarrassed because of the whole situation. It's not Erik that should be scared. I've spoken to many people who were responsible for other people's lives and at the end some months before people are having their parole, they were all like big people with a lot of muscles and an angry look on their face. They were all scared before they were released because of this embarrassment. To see their own reflection in other people's eyes. I think that's also a great fear. Lisa has begun work in the City of New York's legal department. Once she completes college she will study law. I've met people who have committed murders and not all of them are the same. He just happens to be a selfish person. I'm gonna be me. I have to keep going, keep moving on. And do everything in my power like it is my life's goal just to have black guys succeed. So maybe if I could do something in my power to become a politician, to be a mayor, to be anything, an activist, whatever, to help stop this ever from happening again, then that's enough for me. I don't expect nothing else from him and nobody else. I'm gonna tell you this story, my favorite forgiveness story which comes out of a victim-offender dialogue. A friend of mine facilitated it. They were talking, and they went through the horror of the crime, his background and what happened. And then they started talking to each other more as human to human. They both had native American blood in them. They started talking about how in the native tradition, you really love mother earth, sunrises and sunsets, and animals and all that interconnectedness and they were talking about all that. At some point the victim asked to see the facilitator in the hall way. The victim said to the facilitator: 'I was really hoping I could tell him I forgive him today and I can't. I just can't. What should I tell him?' My friend told him what we always tell people, you can either tell him nothing or you tell him the truth. She looked at him and said: 'I was really hoping to say I forgive you, but I am not ready to do that.' He said the most beautiful thing. It was the gift of him understanding her pain and what this was about. He looked at her and said: 'I would never expect you to forgive me for what I did, but if you ever decide to forgive me you need not tell me, just go to a hill site and watch the sunset for both of us.' Restorative justice helps to get beyond the strict separation of offender and victim. Nevertheless, restorative justice is still an unknown territory. Perhaps forgiveness is a change of perspective: Choosing from what has happened to you to forge a new life.
