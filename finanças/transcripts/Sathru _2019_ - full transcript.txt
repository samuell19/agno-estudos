My dear people! Greetings to all spectators! Theme of the folk drama to be played before you by Ramar Koothupattarai of Chennai, we are going to watch the annihilation of evil demon Sooran known as 'Soorasamharam' What you steal is money! What you find in shop is sweet honey! What you offer as sweet Puttu on a girl attaining puberty! You get rap on head if you go to place you don't want to! We are a troupe of folk artistes! Applause please! Ruling over this universe, troubling Gods and their devotees, to kill Sooran, the demon who killed innocent people, to protect us from the evil demon, Lord Muruga killed him! Silence please! Devotees! Lord Muruga, who got the divine Spear as boon from his mother, we will present you the action of- Lord Muruga killing demon Sooran over 16 days! We request devotees to watch the show on all the days to get blessed by Lord Muruga. We humbly request you to forgive us for any mistake in this presentation. Let's watch the atrocities of demon Sooran! What? Is Sooran coming now? Is he going to torture people? What if he kills us too! If he comes, he'll definitely kill! What can we do now? I'll run for my life, if also fear for life, run! No one can kill me in this world! The world is my slave! People are my slaves! Infact Lord Siva is also my slave! My word is law now! My word is rule! World is at my command! Kill people, devotees and Gods who refuse to pray me! Let their blood flow like river and flesh as bank! Only then my thirst of rage will get satiated! What's it, brother? What happened? You made me laugh like a mad man, right? Didn't you buy the liquor I had asked? - I bought it, brother. - First, make a drink for me. What's it, brother? Still thinking about morning incident? Let bygones be bygones, let's think about what to do in future! Say something, Prabha! Shut up, you're responsible for everything. Had you kidnapped the child properly, we could've made a crore easily! He could've settled down in life, right? We were helpless at that time, brother. You should've killed him, right? A crowd gathered, brother. If not we would've killed him, brother. Women surrounded us, had we killed him, they would've raised an alarm. Had it been men, they wouldn't have neared us in fear! Forget it, brother. We kidnapped two kids in Coimbatore, right? Let's plan similar kidnapping here. As soon as he knew about kidnap, he came running with cash to pay ransom. We must plan it like that, brother. Prabha, tell me who our next target is! I'll ensure we don't bungle it again. - Kutty, get me that bag. - Okay, brother. Watch out...careful! See! He's the next target. I want complete details about him and his family in a week. Unlike our previous assignments, this is very big deal! If accomplish this well, all of us can settle down in life. One more thing, if anyone crosses 4 our path, just kill him! - Brother, call from Anbu. - Don't answer it. They showed their true colour. They always do things mindlessly. - Let's call when we need them. - Okay, brother. Don't loiter under the influence of marijuana. Do your work properly. I'm going to keep a watch on them, right? - Where did you keep the key? - It's with you. Why are we living separately? Why not stay together, brother? How happy we can be if we're together! Having a blast of life with liquor and game of cards! Kutty, it's good for us to live separately instead of living together. Because our work demands! If there's any problem, all of us would get caught together. Who would take care of our families then? If I'm in trouble, you'll take care of my family. If you're in trouble, I'll take care of your family. That's why! You always say this, brother. Whatever you may say, it's out of world when we are together. Don't worry, if we execute this plan well, We can live together happily ever after! Okay? One more important thing Keep your homes clean till this job is over. If anyone comes in search, he mustn't get even a bit of paper. - Raghu, buy 50 Korean Mobiles. - Okay, brother. - Kutty, talk to Das and get SIM cards. - Okay, brother. - Bye, brother. - Bye. Bye, brother. - Call from Anbu. - Cut it. - I'll take leave, brother. - Okay. Bye, brother. Where's Balu now? - Salem. - Why did he go to Salem? To attend a friend's daughter's marriage Do you consider yourself a hero? Do you think you can do anything in police uniform? - What happened, sir? - What happened!? Who permitted you to thrash Royapuram Perumal? Smuggled goods confiscated from harbour two days ago... I know everything about it. What's the evidence that he did it? No sir, I suspected his involvement. That's why I inquired him. Are you such a great officer? Will you inquire anyone on suspicion? If Inspector is on leave, cool your heels in station. Don't take law into your hands. Okay, sir If this happens again, will not stop with warning. Get lost Who is he, sir? AC is shouting at him! He's standing his ground bravely without moving an inch. His name is Kathiresan, Royapuram SI. He joined the dept. 2 years ago. Go suspended twice in 2 years! About 3 months ago, for an eve teasing case, though the teaser was MLA's son, he thrashed him mercilessly on road. Infact he took on Commissioner for a case involving his son. Its all not because of new to Department or Young Blood. His character is like that! Brother...brother...brother... Why are you here early in the morning? SI is here to inquire you again, came to inform you, brother. I told him everything, right? What's his problem? - Come. - I don't know, brother. What's your problem, sir? If you visit me often like this, I'll get bad name in this neighbourhood. I don't know anything about the goods. Won't I tell if I know about it? I'll do one thing, I'll send two of my men, close the case with them. They'll have a tour of jail and you can close the case. Why inquire me instead of... Why are you hitting while I'm talking, sir? Don't hit me, sir...don' hit me, sir... Sir...sir...it's paining... Stop it, sir. I asked you to tell me the truth, will you complain with AC? I know whose goods it is! Till you come and accept it, I'll keep on inquiring you. Okay, sir. Greetings, sir. He turned approver, sir. Had you turned approver earlier, I wouldn't have inquired you, right? Forgive me, sir. Sir, Perumal has agreed he smuggled the goods confiscated in harbour. What to do now, sir? - Shall I file FIR or....? - Do something. Take their statements and arrest them. Oh no...don't hit me, sir... Tell me...tell me... - Don't hit me, sir - Tell me...tell me... - Don't hit me, sir - Tell me... It's paining...no...no...sir... - Did they accept the crime? - No sir. Sir...sir...don't hit me... - Will you accept? - I'll accept sir... Hello There's trouble in Sunshine bar, sir. - Please come immediately, sir. - Okay, we're coming. Sir, it seems someone is creating trouble in Sunshine bar. Okay, check it. - Sir... - What? Shall I send someone else to the court, sir? You carry on the court work, I'll go to the bar. Okay, sir. - Where are they? - Upstairs, sir...come. sir. - Inside? - Yes, sir. "I'm straight forward..." "I don't tell lies..." What happened? - Are you mad? - Yes, I'm mad, sir. A young man loved me for 2 years, sir. He chased me till I accepted his love. After our marriage is fixed, he isn't calling me on phone. Arrest him, sir. No...no...kill him in an encounter. Look dear, I was on duty since morning. That's why.... - How did you come now? - I'm on duty now also. They said trouble, so I'm here... You're on duty, right? Don't answer the call. AC is calling me urgently, can I go...? Okay, go. How many days are you going to take leave for Kathiresan's marriage? 'Kashmir' One week. Why? Shruthi wanted to visit Ooty for quite long time. If you take 2 weeks off, we can also spend some time in Ooty. Is it for her sake or you...? Oh no...for her sake only. She has been insisting on having a kid brother for quite long time. Just a sec, wait. Darshini is calling, I'll call you later. Okay...okay... - Hey - Yes Get going quickly. Darshini would be waiting on road. Okay, father. Brother, that boy's father is Mahendran. As you told me, he owns 3 jewellary shops in city. His family consists of 4 members. He, his wife, his mother... and then his son. His wife and mother come out of home only on work. That boy is studying class 3 in Srividya School. There are 3 cars in is house, brother. He uses BMW, his wife uses Audi, Benz for that little boy. He goes to school in that car only. Driver is Namasivayam. Inquired about him, honest man. But short tempered. If we seek help from him, we'll get caught. That little boy leaves home at 7.30 am. There's no else with him other than that driver. The car takes left turn after coming out of home. The car races without any traffic for 700 meters, then takes two left turns and two right turns, brother. Takes last right turn near Gandhi statue. Driver will go fast if there's no traffic. He'll stop at school gate in next 3 minutes. School is on the left side, so the boy sits on the left side in back seat. The boy enters school immediately on getting down from car. Distance between parking car and school gate is 20 feet only. Two watchmen at the gate, we can't enter the premises. After school closes, the car is parked at the same place. But the boy's mother or father will definitely accompany him from school. Any which way we look... It's risky, Prabha. Brother, car has started. Hey you, what's your problem? Why are you going on honking horn? Will you keep on honking horn if you've a car? - What the heck! - Sorry, brother. Do you know who you're talking to? How dare! Drive carefully! Be careful! Do you know who I am? - Why are you stopping me? - Listen to me, keep quiet If I see you again... Why did you leave my son alone in car and got down? ICICI Bank account has Rs.70 lakhs. HDFC Bank account has Rs.10033000, sir. Rs.70 lakhs in City Bank, sir. Withdraw all the cash. Okay, sir If that's not enough, let's take out cash hidden in bank locker. Okay? No need to rush, Mahendran. We know AC very well, let's inform him first. Uncle, keep police out of it. What can we do if they refuse to return the child after taking ransom? Let's go to police first, that's safe for us. Do you've enemies? I mean in business or personal? No one like that, sir. Do you suspect anyone? Suspect? No one, sir. - Can you see anything else? - Nothing. But called AC sir directly on phone. - What's their demand? - Rs.3 crores. It's not Rs.3 crores but Rs.5 crores. Will call you again at 3 pm. Keep the cash ready. Arrange the cash instead of wasting time on tracing this call. Call came from Avadi this time but the caller is another man. Please take her out. Sir, I'm scared... let's pay ransom, sir. Sir, don't rush, first demand was Rs.3 crores, now their demand is Rs.5 crores. Can't pay ransom as they demand. Money is not important to me, my son is important to me. Correct, sir. Sir, let's first pay ransom and save the child. Then, let's trace them... What are you saying, Kathir? Can we give money if some stranger calls and demands ransom? They kidnapped his son for money, why did they kidnap another child also? Their target is not money but some other motive. Moreover how can we believe the child is with him? Sir, please listen to me. Sir, I feel money is the motive from their phone calls. We can't decide like that, we've to think in all directions, Kathir. We have to think in all direction Wait I'll show you How to handle this? Let's be little patient, sir. - Is money ready? - Arranging it. - Please give me little time. - What? Arranging money? Yes, earlier demand was Rs.3 crores, now, you're asking Rs.5 crores. Shouldn't we arrange it? We're serious here, can't you arrange Rs. 5 crores also? We're arranging the cash. Can we talk to the child before that? Will you talk non-sense like this in the name of smart moves? No use in talking to you, give the phone to Mahendran. Hey! I think you don't love your son. That's why you went to police despite my warning. They're now playing with your son's life. They're trying to save your money not your son. Watch, what they're going to save! Not like that Hello...hello Please save my son, sir. Let's pay them, sir. I want my son, sir. - Please sir...do something, sir... - Don't worry, please sit down. Sir, they killed my son! Sir!...sir! My... My child... Oh no...my son! Look at my son's body! My son...my son... Look at my son...my son... Hello Assistant Commissioner, I'll warn only once. Don't force me to kill another child. Don't stop me now. Just listen to what I say! Exactly at 9, one among you, must come with cash to B2 coach of Kaveri Express leaving from Chennai. No smart moves, it may take another child's life. Last thing, I'm watching your every move. I'm listening to every word you say! From which platform train to Vizag leaves, brother? I don't know. Give the bag to any girl boarding B2 coach and leave the place. Which girl? What is this hair style? It's there...get inside. That right side. Please take care of it. I'll buy water bottle. Be careful! One water bottle, please. Take it. Madam change Madam Brother, I forgot to take the change. I called you, madam, but you didn't turn back. Excuse me - Madam, a small help. - What? My name is Kathir. I'm a police officer, a small problem. Will you please keep this bag with you? Who the heck are you? What's your problem? Why are you giving it to me? Please try to understand me, madam. I'm also a police officer. Please check my ID card. A child has been kidnapped and they're demanding ransom. - This bag has cash. - Kidnapped? Sir, please don't get me into trouble. Please give this to someone else. You won't get into any trouble, madam. They've already killed a child and blackmailing us with another child. Please try to understand. You please try to understand my position, sir. Please find someone else, sir. - Mother! - Coming! - Excuse me, sir - Madam He's also of your son's age. His mother is also waiting eagerly to see him. Please help at least for her, madam. - Sir, child... - Mother! Coming, son. You're saying child... kidnap...ransom... We'll not get into any trouble, right? Madam, you won't get into any trouble, I'll travel in the next compartment. Please, take it. - Thank you - Okay. Excuse me Move please! Move please... What happened, madam? Don't know who he is! Suddenly a man came, without caring that she's a woman, he hit her black and blue and ran away with her bag. - I'll come with Prabha. - Okay, brother. Hello May I come in? How did he come here, Prabha? Whatever it may be, let's think about it tomorrow morning. Shot him! He was faithful to us! Police must arrest criminals, why did he shot him dead? What are we to tell his family? He was talking about seeing his mother and sending money to family. They killed him at young age! Why are you silent, brother? I must see him... I must talk to him... I feel like sharing food with him, brother. Kolathur Munusamy's body is ready. Who's the claimant? Come here. Wait, I'll come Oh God! They killed Kutty, man Hey, Guna! They killed Kutty brutally Police...police... Let's go brother Come Do you know what you're doing? - Say something. - No sir...that is... I don't want any explanation. Had anything happened to the child? Who would take the responsibility? Will you explain it to higher officers and press? You'll do something like action film hero. But if anything goes wrong, you'll stand here like an innocent boy. We've to bang heads for it, right? No sir, they already killed a child... - That's why, I... - Stop it! Don't we know to do it? Are you teaching me what I should do? Earlier you bashed up Royapuram Perumal to turn approver. He called me up to tell this. What the hell are we here for? Leave it. What did I tell you? I told you to give money and come back, we'll discuss later Why the hell did you do like that? Thank God, the child is safe. This is not the first time, you disobeyed senior officer's order many times. I've warned you many a times. You take every warning first time. Sir, this will not happen again, sir. I am very sorry Panneerselvam, you take charge of the case. Enough of him. Thank you, sir For disobeying senior officer's order and without my permission, for the action you had taken, I'm suspending you for 3 months. Go home and take rest. I am very sorry I heard about your suspension. Idiots! Suspension for your heroic deed! That's why our dept. is like this. Sir, if you recommend me... it'll be helpful. Oh no...to roll down my dead. That's why our police dept. is like this. But one thing, had I been Commissioner, I would've celebrated this grandly. Sir, you don't need to be a Commissioner to throw a party. Am I right? Then, I'm throwing a party on Sunday in my home. - Okay? - Super sir. Then, be careful. Don't know how many boys were there in the gang? They may attack you in retaliation. Sir, it is not possible. How many they would be? 10? 15? Okay, assume they're 20. We're over a lakh in our department. Police officers get attacked in films only. In real life, they'll wet their pants. Killed one, right? Others would've run away in fear. Even if they do come, I'm not afraid of them, sir. Because we're police men! - You don't forget that, sir. - Okay, sir If he kills one of us, does he think we would run away in fear? We must make him run for his life. Though so many of us are here, Kutty is lying there as unclaimed body. He deserves death for this. No, brother. Not just him, brother. Before he dies, he must cry for every gory death in his family, brother. Prabha, he must answer for Kutty's death. Let this be a lesson to every police officer who kills people in encounters. We must do this before the hurt wound heals. We're doing it one day! This must be the headline of every newspaper next morning. Every police officer must think twice before killing any criminal. They must fear! Shruthi - Where's the photo that was here? - I don't know, mom. You throw away things. Bye - Hey...hey - Hurray - Mother! - Wait...wait.. - Mother - Don't come. - Mother! - Hey! Mother! Oh God! Look at me, Shruthi. Shruthi! Oh God! We came here half hour ago, doctors are checking. - She's in ICU. - Nothing to worry. - I've talked to doctor. - Who is patient's father? Her father is out of station. I'm her grandfather. Please sign this. Pay money in cash counter. Operation is on, nothing to fear. When are you coming? Flight leaves tomorrow morning only. I'll be there by afternoon. Okay Sister, a child was admitted last evening after meeting with an accident. - Where is she now? - Second floor operation theatre. - How is she doing? - Serious condition only. - Thank you - Okay - Father! - How is she now? Operation is on, father. You don't worry, dear... nothing will happen to her. We've boarded train. We'll come straight to hospital by morning. - Which train? - Cheran express. Train is moving, I'll talk to you personally. Okay, father. - What? - My parents are coming. They're coming in Cheran express. - Uncle? - Yes. Paid cash, father. No problem. Okay, son. I inquired, I'm sure the child will not survive. Had you said yes, I would've burnt down the hospital. Let's stay here and kill every member of his family one after the other. Yes Prabha, if two are inside, two of us will wait outside. Let anyone come out, we'll kill them. No Guna, it's risky to attack now. What's the risk, brother? We can take any risk for Kutty. Don't talk like a mad man. You saw the crowd inside, right? Be patient. Entire hospital will be sleeping early in the morning. That's the best time for us. - Sekar, take him with you. - Okay, brother. We're meeting here again tomorrow morning at 3 am. At dawn, he must see another family member dead. Guna, let's go. Get in quickly. If he says, he'll surely come. He won't go away. You keep the gate open. Must do something to distract opposite house man He's disturbing us a lot. - Why you want to see him? - Where's your husband? Don't cry. Someone may come in. Let's go. Police shot him dead. I can't bear it. He was right before our eyes. He used to come silently. He said let's take care of it tomorrow morning, let's go. Why should we wait till morning? We should've killed him there itself. You brought me here like a coward. I don't need anyone's help, I'll kill him myself. Are you blabbering getting drunk? I said let's go, right? Come, let's go. - Tell me. - Buddy... Got the vehicle. But records are fake. But still we're inquiring about the vehicle. One more important thing. Handicapped man's body is missing from mortuary. Everyone knew about it since morning but didn't tell anyone. I came to know just now. Better to be careful. Don't know how many are in the gang? They may attack you in retaliation. Shruthi has met with an accident. What? Had food? Buddy, you go home, I've a small work will finish and come. I'm nearby Baby I'll tell my parents that I'm going out with a friend. Okay. Okay...okay... Okay, I'll hang up. - Hello - Kathir? Yes, you...? Got to know who we are now? She should've died immediately on hitting her. Her good time, got postponed by a day. Don't keep hope of her survival. Nobody can stop her from death. Who are you, man? Who am I? You killed and sent my friend to mortuary thinking there's nobody to question you. We're there for him. We'll kill your entire family and send them to mortuary in 24 hours. Had he allowed me, I would've killed you all tonight. You escaped...you're a little boy! You shot him dead because you're a police man, right? Fear will enter you now about who in your family would die next and where? It'll tell you, who we are! Who the hell are you? Hello Boy, pay for the phone call. Hello Got a call from this number just now, do you know who he is! Who the hell are you? Who is on phone? It's for me, brother. For me. Hello Cradle the phone properly. I'm telling you, cradle the phone properly. Answer the call. I said answer it. They don't know what they do if they're drunk. They'll never come good in life. They'll reform only if we go to police and get them thrashed. No way, if we go police, I've to spend more than my broken phone. - What do you want? - I want 4 packets. - What packets? - Condoms. Super Unlike you today's young men don't worry about safety. Who was on phone? No one...wrong number. Lie, tell me the truth. Who was on phone? - What's the problem? - I said nothing, right? What happened to you? It was just a wrong call, right? Why are you getting so angry for that? What's it? Come out bravely. Father, it wasn't an accident Shruthi met with. Yes, father. They did it with a plan to kill her, father. Moreover, Shruthi isn't just their target. All of us are their target. A man died in child's kidnap case, right? His gang members. Who are they? They're threatening you! I think they don't know about you. What? Would they kill all of us in 24 hours? You too have the same time. Don't leave anyone. Pain of a police man mustn't be seen in his eyes. It must be seen in his action only. You must show your anger in every step you take. Your anger must instill fear in enemy. This is not for me or my family. For this country. The day you took the oath as police officer, you've sacrificed your family for this nation. Go bravely, son. I'll take care of our family. Ensure never again another family faces this problem. Go. 'Hospital 09:00:02PM' Blow...blow... Sir, he's drunk. Brother, a man called on phone from your shop. Do you know who he is? Did he call you? What's the problem between you guys? Why did he break my phone? Buy a new phone for me, if not I'll call police. We too are police officers. We're to investigate a case. Police? Sorry sir A man did call from here, sir. After making the call, he broke my phone and ran away. New phone, sir. - Do you know him or not? - I don't know him, sir. Buddy, if a man calls from here to threaten you. I'm sure he's not from this area. Let's inform AC about this problem. No, he's already angry on me. The problem is he's angry on you. If you do anything now, it'll create more problems for you. So, better to inform him immediately. - No... - Don't think. Call him immediately. Tell me. I'm Kathir here, sir. Police do get threatening calls, can we fear for every call? You should've listened to my orders. You went overboard, okay... Call and inform Inspector Panneer. What did he tell you? He asked me to call Inspector Panneerselvam. Have you started it again, Kathir? Don't forget you're under suspension. You should've called me first to talk about this case, right? Why did you call AC? You killed a criminal you should've arrested. Now body is missing from mortuary. I'm investigating from all sides. I'll catch them in couple of days. It's safe for you to stay in hospital with your family. I'll send two police men for security, be careful. What? It seems he'll catch them in couple of days. Suggested me to hide in hospital without fearing them. If a girl is hacked to death on road, it takes 2 hours to clear her body. It takes 2 days to decide which station must deal the case. Even after seeing the killer's face clearly in CCTV, it takes 10 days to catch him, they'll entire police dept. is responsible for this. But the real reason is officers like him. Don't know who they are, how many they are, don't know how they look like, in such a situation, not just 2 days, they may not catch them in 2 months also. I don't have that much time also. - What time did you get the call? - About 9. Tell me if the man who came here is in this. Give me. It vehicle goes to court, it may take about a week. Pay fine and take your vehicle as sir says. I don't have money, sir. I've to withdraw money from ATM. Get it, I'll talk to sir. None in these photos, sir. He was dark with curly hair. Okay. If you see him again, call me immediately. Okay, sir. - Bye, sir. - Okay 'Kotturpuram Police Station 11:45:23PM' Sir, cash...my bike keys, sir. - Come tomorrow morning to collect slip. - Okay, sir.

When I inquired their families, they said all five of them were working in Chennai, and were sending Rs.20000 to homes every month. But nobody in their homes knows where these boys are working. Only once in school they created some trouble. But there's no police record or black mark, clean slate. - Got any photos of them? - Yes. - WhatsApp their photos to me. - Okay Talk to him.

What did you say now? Yes sir, I came once to an Beach House with her. - Do you know where it is? - I don't know which area that is. There are just few houses in the street.

Yes sir, just before Maayajal. - Ok, thank you - Thanks, sir That particular car didn't cross toll gate. If my guess is right, this toll gate is just 5 kilometers from Panaiyur. They must be somewhere in these 5 kilometers range only. Moreover beach side home... I think we're very close to them. Scoundrel police mentality! Are you playing with me with your silly mentality? Though there's a life in my hands, you still want to take my life, right? I'll show you my power! - Who is it? - It's him! Where are you guys? Outside the hospital, brother.

Owner lives in foreign. I'll take a leak, sir. Come. That military man is here, brother. Very difficult to enter now. - What are you saying? - Yes, brother. Can't kill anyone here as you say. Entire place is crowded. Moreover police are guarding in civil dress. I'll call you later. Hello! Who are you, sir? Who are you planning to kill? - Are police guarding upstairs for you? - Wait... Who is it? My wife. She's calling me getting scared on not finding son in school. What did you tell her? I managed her by telling he's with me. Look, I don't know about the situation inside. Call AC and get entire team to reach here. Surround the house. Police? Playing with me? If we go to police, they may harm my son. We know they're here, right? Let's deal it ourselves. Don't be so naive. We don't know how many there are inside and what weapons they're carrying! It's not safe to enter now, have little patience. What are you saying? Should I be patient? - It's my son inside there. - Don't shout. I don't mind if you don't come in, forget it. I know how to save my son. Just a minute. Come.

Okay Prabha, it's clear. - Clear? - Yes. - Hello! - Why are you staring? I'll ask Prabha to call later. What are you thinking about? Kill them first. Let's think about killing others later. If I wanted to kill him, I would've done it long back. He mustn't die so quickly. He must know no one in his family is alive. He must die only after that. Only then all my efforts till now would be justified. - Where are you guys? - Here only, brother. Made a small mistake. A nurse heard our phone conversation. She tried to call police. I didn't have choice, I killed her, brother. She's dead, right? To hell with it. Go immediately to the backside of hospital. That military man will come alone.

We can kill them only if you come here, brother. Okay, stay there, I'm coming. Do you know the matter? Your brother is lying dead. I'm going there, I'll tell you who else is dead. Guna, you stay here. Be careful. Kill them if they make any move. Okay, Prabha. Tonight is your last night, don't worry. I'll come back soon. Kasthuri Where? Where is he? Stop! Who are you, sir? What are you doing near car? How did you hurt your head? - You showed your true colour, right? - We didn't have any choice, brother. Take him away. Entire police force will be here in few minutes. Already entire city police has been alerted. By now police would've killed them in encounter, right? You're next. If you surrender yourself to police, at least you'll be alive in jail. - Untie them, boy! - Okay, sir I told you to bring police, right? I'm an accused myself, how can I go to police station? Get in. Take him to nearest hospital. Careful. 'East Coast Road 06:11:35PM' Sister, you stay here, I'll go to canteen. - Are you Shruthi's mother? - Yes.
