The famous Hang Seng bank robbery happened on August fifth, 1975. It shocked Hong Kong and the whole world. Forty-five days after the robbery, on September twentieth, 1975... six robbers were arrested except for one, who escaped during the robbery. In June 1976, the case was closed in court. Six of them were sentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment. But they appealed to the court. The judge, on account of their clean record... reduced their sentence by five years. In June 1989, they were released. But the escapee was still at large. The story of this film was told by one of the robbers. It helps us to understand the truth and inside story of this crime. Mr Zhang, how did the cultural revolution impact you? Why would you ask such a question? We want to know your background... and to find out what motivated you to rob a bank. The robbery was long ago. Why does a TV station all the way from England... want to interview me about this? Mr Zhang, the robbery in the Hung Hom cross harbour tunnel... is the biggest robbery case in Hong Kong. But until now... there has been no detailed coverage from the media. That's why we want the whole truth... and we want it straight from your mouth. You want the whole truth? Why not start from the day you came to Hong Kong? Mr Zhang, what is your reason for leaving China? Maybe it was heaven's will. During the revolution, we were the rebellious students. Later on, the authorities went down the wrong path. Everyone was sent to villages or mountains... to be re-educated in the poor workers and peasants way of life. I didn't want to be pushed around anymore... that's why I decided to come to Hong Kong. You came here alone? Take me to Crazy Bo. Yin has told me everything. - Kuan... - Don't talk so much. Let's go. Thank you, Mr Bo! Please take good care of me! Don't worry, I'll contact your boss. Thank you, Mr Bo! Always pretending to be a big shot... why talk so much to him? Let's go. Don't beat me... Go to hell! You tried to make a fool out of us! Because of you, my comrades had to run away! Pay back the money or go to hell! What's happening? Let's talk it over. Ding, what happened? - How are you? - It hurts... Yew, Kuan is here. Why so late? You don't have to work tomorrow? Can I have supper with you? But you have to wait for me to finish my work first. Sure, we can wait forever. But the one who will wait for you is not me, but Kuan. You two can have some beer, and let me finish my work first. - Come, let's have some beer. - Long-time no see! Kuan, thank you for tonight. I don't like to help you like this every time. I understand. You don't like me to mess around. We've been in Hong Kong for so long, do you ever think for yourself? - Of course I do! - What is the conclusion? So far, nothing! I'm serious! Don't fool around! But it is a fact! We can't do whatever we want to do. If we could, we wouldn't be sitting here. Have you ever tried it? Try what? What can I do? Like me, as a construction worker. Do you want to live a life like that forever? Don't forget you still have someone to take care of. I'm different, I've nothing to worry about if I die. Where are we going to have supper? It's none of my business. You're not coming along? I've only got one bike, how can I carry the two of you? So I might as well go home. Good night! Kiong... You don't have to say anything. We understand each other. Is your work tough? Life has never been easy, so I never know what comfort is. What happened between you and Kiong? Nothing. I know you two too well. I know you three are good friends. Kiong is a grown man, he knows what to do. You don't have to worry about him. What are you thinking about? I have a day off tomorrow. How about we find Dong to get a pair of free movie tickets? Would we still go even if Dong didn't have free tickets? We can save some money if we can get free tickets. Why do you want to save so much money? To get a second wife! You are still single, why do you want a second wife? Aren't you my wife? You are my wife! - Come and move the board away. - I'm coming. - Come over here and finish it. - Okay... Here is your letter. How's your family? Same as usual. Why are you looking for me in such a hurry? What do you think of that case? I still haven't decided yet. Are there any problems? You can tell me. I don't think it's that simple. I've given it a lot of thought. If this case... is pulled off successfully... we will each get one million. More than our life time income. If we failed... we would get eight to ten years in prison. Risking ten years of freedom for a fortune... I think it is worth it. Kuan, you are early. We're talking about that bank robbery case. Kuan, Kiong is already in, it's up to you now. Kuan, if we three work together, nothing is impossible. You're Mark's good friend, there'll be no problem getting the guns. Do we have any other way out? No. You should know the opposite of the word "God." It is either god... or dog. There is no middle path to take. Think it over carefully. We'll wait for your decision. Kiong, we'll talk it over with the driver tomorrow. Who is he? Can he be trusted? His name is Lee Guoming, from mainland China. There should be no problem since he is from the same place as us. You can discuss your plans, I've got to go now. When can we leave Hong Kong by plane? Very soon. Are you leaving Hong Kong after we finish the job? With that kind of money, we can go anywhere. I think everywhere is the same. Whatever the outcome is... I have tried so hard to get here... I would rather die than to spend the rest of my life in jail. Don't worry. We came from mainland China. Our records are clean. The police will never find us. - He is Lee Guoming? - Yes. He was with Crazy Bo last time, can he be trusted? Crazy Bo? - He was beaten by you and Kuan? - Yes. Kiong, meet Lee. I don't know what happened between the two of you... just get the job done. Don't forget what our real aim is here. What's the matter? Crazy Bo and I are not friends. He is a good-for-nothing loser who never respects others. I only care about money. I don't care about other things. I hope you are telling the truth. You better not fool us. - We'll talk it over in the car. - Okay. Do the guys have clean records? Don't worry, they are all from China. Everyone is clean in Hong Kong. You better check carefully, I don't want guys with records. Don't let the police follow us. Don't worry! I win again! How are you, darling? Win again? - How are you, sweet heart? - I'm not your sweet heart. Are you trying to be funny? What's taking you so long to shoot a ball? Keep your mouth shut! Take him outside! Why didn't you pay back the debts you owe me? I'm just trying my luck here to win enough money to pay you. Darn you! If you're lucky, you wouldn't be here now. - Beat him! - Wait a minute! What's the matter? He owes me money, so I'm beating him up. He is my friend. We can settle it tomorrow. Now I need to talk to him. Alright, I will deal with him next time. Let's go! You've been having a lot of problems lately. Mr Bo, please take good care of me. No problem. Now your good friend doesn't want to take on a job. How about you? I'll do whatever you need me to. Remember those guys who beat me up last time? Yes, I remember. What are you thinking about? You seem upset. That day, Dong said that after the job is done, he will leave Hong Kong. All we can do is just sit here and see him off. What's really on your mind? Okay. Don't get mad if I spell it out. Just say it. You can do the same as Dong. - What? - Try your luck. If you're successful, you can leave too. It is easy to say it. Actually a place and time can change one's thinking. To tell the truth, we've been here long enough. But we don't know each other's thoughts. Why worry about others? This is your game. As long as you know how to play it... you'll have the chance to win it. Don't forget what you said last time. There are many things in this world which you can't do as you please. Right. But at least you should let others know what you want to do. If you won't let me know, you should at least tell Yew. Don't do things you can't handle... otherwise... you'll lose your confidence and others will be disappointed. Chairman Mao said don't fight a war that you are not confident of. - Any good horses to bet on? - Number three is a sure win! - Are you sure? - It's a winner! What do you need? Four Red Star guns and two grenades. Are you sure, Kuan? Are you fighting a war? It is not for me. I'm getting it for Dong and Kiong. You knew Kiong in the mainland, right? Yes, we met before. When you have the goods, contact Kiong directly. Alright. When can we get those weapons? As soon as possible. Recently, someone also requested the same type of weapons. - The same type of weapons. - From which gang? It's a gangster called Ding. - Ding? - Do you know him? I've seen him several times. - Better leave that guy alone. - Why? He sold me a car last time... but it was a stolen car... and the police confiscated it. Luckily I still hadn't paid him yet, otherwise I'd be in trouble. Really? - Brother Gou, it's time. - Okay. I've got to go now. - Excuse me. - It's time. I've got to go now. Don't worry. I'll inform you right away when I have the weapons. - Best of luck! - Thanks! Let me give you a tip. For the second race, number three is a sure win. Take care! Look at him... gambling for his whole life! If you don't gamble, how do you know you're in luck? They are starting to fight again. You think I'm scared of you? - Get him! - Beat him! Youngsters nowadays are reckless. It's nothing compared to us. After I settled down in Hong Kong... I left all the troubling memories behind in China. I hope all my former classmates could live a decent life... and start all over again. I never thought of robbing a bank. Even though Dong mentioned it several times... I never agreed that it was a good way to get rich. Finally, I realised that I was cheating myself all along. From high school until the Cultural Revolution... and from China to Hong Kong, and after the robbery... I was never part of them. Yew. You've got the tickets? But Kiong isn't here yet. He is always late. He has something to discuss with Dong tonight. I think he's on his way now. I'll give him a call in case he forgot. - The one who is making a call! - Get him! Kuan... Kuan... Chop him! Chop him into pieces! Run! Don't go! Are you alright? Get some rest. - Where is Yew? Is she alright? - She is fine. Did they hit you? What's wrong? Why do you care about me? You can't even take care of yourself. Those guys got it wrong, and attacked the wrong person. I don't mind being beaten, because I'm used to it. Anyone getting hurt is not good. The street was full of people, why did they only choose you? They even tried to stab you! What kind of enemy do you have? Are you hiding something from me? I have nothing to hide from you. If you don't want to tell me, fine! Yew... Don't be like this. The two of you should talk. He always keeps things deep in his heart. I don't know what he's thinking. You know him, he won't hide anything from you. He doesn't want you to worry, that's all. Kiong. - Use warm water to clean the wound. - Okay. How is she? She is fine. She wants you to get some rest. Who were those guys anyway? I have no idea. I only recognised that guy Ding. He is under Lee. - I'll introduce a girl to you. - Make sure you keep your word. Dong, how have you been recently? Calm down! Don't fight! - Darn you! - Don't move! - What's the matter? - That guy attacked Kuan that day! Why did you follow Crazy Bo's orders? Are you under me or him? Dong, can we leave these private matters aside? Dong, either him or I must leave. Dong, you told me to look for a good driver. He's a brilliant driver. It would be a waste not to use him. If he is that good, why did he become a car thief? Lee, this guy has a bad record... How can I trust you if you couldn't control your men? Why didn't you tell me about it? Are you trying to get us into trouble? - But it is just a minor case. - It is just the same! Get out of here! - Lee... - We don't need you anymore. - Move! - Move! What are you looking at? Get out of here! Don't obstruct our work! Now the dispute is settled, everybody is happy. Alright, I won't waste your time. We'll go ahead with the plan in five days. - So soon? - You long for it, don't you? Dong, I'll do whatever you say. I'll explain the details now. Kiong will get the firearms. After everything is ready, we can start anytime. Have your cars ready, the sooner the better. The cars are not a problem. My men will do their best. You always let us down! - You are a bad apple. - Lee. Ding... you're my boy, I'll take good care of you. Just do whatever you are told. I know what to do. I'll give you your share. Just get the cars ready. - Thank you, Lee. - Alright. I can't fix this radio either. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting Ma. - I'll go with you. - Don't bother. Why not go find your girlfriend, Yew? Be nice to her. Kiong. - Gou is waiting for you upstairs. - Let's go then. He is on the third floor. We're almost there. Get away from me, drug addict! Don't block my way! Police often survey this area, we will be in trouble sooner or later. - Kiong, sorry about that. - It's alright. Are you satisfied? - This stuff is hard to find. - Thank you, Gou. Let's go. You three, stop right there! Are you working here? What are you staring at? I said stand right there! Don't try to be funny! What's inside the bag? All of you face the wall! Let's run! Run! What's wrong? Don't run! Stop right there! Don't run! Don't run! - Freeze! - Go! Go! Go! Go that way! Freeze! Don't run! Down there! That was really bad luck. Running into the police like that. Don't talk, get some rest. You are lucky that shot didn't kill you. Forget it. Kiong, you can't do the job. Forget about it. I'm fine. It's just a little scratch. I'll get used to it. The police are looking for you. They might recognise you. You better get some rest. Kuan. Let's go outside and talk. Do you think it's unfair to Kiong? You're a reasonable guy. You know that I have no choice. Kuan... I'm hoping that you can replace him. I know that you've always wanted to leave here. But you need money to go to Malaysia. Why not use this chance... to help yourself... as well as to help Kiong? After the job is done, we'll give a share to Kiong. Dong. Is Kiong alright? Is he still alive? You would like to see him dead? No! He was wounded for the job... I'm just concerned for him. It is very tense outside, what about the job? What do you think? Since Kiong is wounded and wanted by the police... he can't work with us anymore. I think... we should leave him out of this. Dong, don't misunderstand me. I've got no hard feelings towards him. I'm just telling the truth. You're right, so I've asked Kuan to replace him. It doesn't matter... as long as he can get the job done. There's something I have to tell you. After we finish the job, Kiong will still have his share. Are you kidding? He does no work and can still have a share of the money? Why not share it with everybody? What are you talking about? Kiong got hurt because of us. He has done his part... so he should have his share. You say that because he is your buddy. I agree with this decision. Dong, it's unfair! You made your own decision! If you don't agree, just leave! - You want to fight with me? - Lee! You should know that no one is indispensable. You can leave if you want. Alright then. Do as you wish. After we parted at the last meeting... we carried out our jobs. Can you tell us more about how you guys worked together? Dong was the mastermind. He knew the exact time and route of the armoured car... and he knew which bank employee was holding on to which cash box. What about Lee's role? He was in charge of the cars and drivers. Why did you choose them for such a crucial role? Because they arrived in Hong Kong earlier than us... they knew the roads well and they drove brilliantly. How did you carry out the master plan? According to Dong's and Lee's research... there were three spots suitable for the job. The first one would be Hong Street. The second one was Song Street. And the third one was the Hung Hom cross harbour tunnel. Why did you finally choose the tunnel in the end? It was Lee's decision... because he was the expert in this field. We trusted him... and it proved that he was right. What was the plan after you got the money? We rented a house beforehand. We planned to divide the money three days after the job was done. Who was responsible to carry the money? What if someone tried to run away with the money? Dong was cautious about that. He divided us into two groups. Each group took two boxes of cash... and we would divide the cash later. It would ensure that nobody would try anything funny. I will go to Malaysia at a later date. Malaysia? Why do you want to go there all of a sudden? I've told you before. I have a relative there who set up a restaurant. He wants me to go there and help him. I've given it some serious thought. Since I can't make money here... I might as well go over there. I would like you to come along with me. What do you think? This is too sudden. How am I going to tell my father? Don't worry, I've already told your father. - He agreed to it. - So you planned this out already. I wonder how they celebrate Christmas over there? My dear brother, Hong Kong is a free and prosperous capitalist country. You grew up in China... so have you adapted to the way of life over there yet? But I believe that no matter what, that place is much better than here. And I'll always remember what you said... you prefer to be a wild and free wolf... than to be an obedient dog. Brother, the day after tomorrow is father's death anniversary. Even if you don't believe in ghosts and spirits... please burn a stick of incense for our father... so that he would know that you're not following his path. Target has appeared. The box is placed in the trunk of the first blue car. The target has started to move, we'll start our plan now. Target is now on Foo Road. Darn you! Couldn't you see me? - Where are you from? - It was your fault! What's wrong? Sir, they ignored the traffic light and knocked me down! - What happened? - Sir, it wasn't our fault! He is the one who ignored the traffic light! - It was their fault. - They said it was your fault! Are you hurt? You're not hurt, right? - Don't block the traffic then. - You better be careful! Don't drive too fast too. Are you going to rob the bank? - Move along! Go! - Thank you, sir. It is coming! Target has appeared! We're following it now. But there is no sign of Kuan's car. Forget about Kuan's car, just follow the target. Don't let the target out of your sight. Robbery! Don't move! Give me your weapon! Don't move! - Start the car! - Faster! Finally, we've won a battle. Hopefully we're on the right track this time. This is the scene of a robbery. This morning, two armoured cars were robbed... at the entrance of Hung Hom cross harbour tunnel. The initial damage was estimated at USD seven million. It is the biggest robbery ever to happen in Hong Kong. The police are very concerned about the case... and a task force has been setup to investigate the case. - There was a robbery... - Who's calling? Lee? I'm Ding. The job was done beautifully! You've become so rich after only one job! When are you going to split the money? Keep your mouth shut! Don't you know the police are looking for us? I know what to do. But Lee, don't forget about my share! You better hang up now, I'll call you later. - Who's calling? - Dong? - What do you want? - Have you seen the news? Speak up. They said the sum is seven million U.S. dollars. What I got is only Yen and Peso. It doesn't seem right. Everything I got is USD. I think the sum is right. It is a big sum of money, I'm worried I'm being scammed. Why don't we split the money soon, so that everyone is happy? - It is not necessary. - Dong, it isn't right! - What I think is... - Are you worried I'll con you? Even if I con you, you can't find me now. This is the final decision. We will meet three days later. Dong... How dare he hang up on me? Darn you! Police have analysed the heist and believe there were twenty robbers. Police are looking for a robber according to a drawing. Seven hundred thousand reward for the arrest of ten robbers. Here is the money including Peso, Yen, HK and US dollars. It will be shared among seven people. Kuan will hand over the money to Kiong. Are you kidding? It was six people, why divide into seven shares? Why are you looking at me? You didn't tell them? You should've said so earlier, then there would be no dispute. And we wouldn't have to be fighting over it now. We said it earlier, Kiong will have his share. We all agreed on that. You were there too. But I don't know anything. I wasn't there. Now you want to divide the money into seven shares? What's the meaning of this? You're fooling us? Do you think we are stupid? Lee, will you keep your word? What do you mean keep my word? I always believe in majority wins. If they agree to split, I'll agree too. If they don't agree, I won't agree too! Don't talk rubbish! I say split it into seven shares! Do you agree or not? - No way! - Stop! I'm telling you now! If Kiong doesn't get his share... you'll get nothing out of it! We're already prepared to die. If we can talk it over, everything will be fine. We have to be fair. What do you suggest? Like you said, we have to take care of our men. Ding also did his part. If Kiong gets his share, Ding must have his share too! Alright then, we'll divide it into eight shares. Stop fooling around! Stand still! Get ready! - Come quickly! - Hurry up! - Let's see the photo! - Let me... This picture is really nice! You keep it! You don't look pretty, that's why you don't want to keep it! Go to hell! How is that case? It's fine. You already got your share. Don't worry about it, everything is fine. The electricity stopped again? Come over. Happy birthday! What? Are you trying to act cool? Or are you too happy? Why are you so quiet? This is my first birthday cake. Thanks to both of you! I'm glad that you're happy. You look like a big kid! Is your wound getting better? Yes, it has almost healed. Tell Yew to stop acting like my mom. She treats me like a kid. You have a big wound there, you should get more rest. We'll be leaving you soon. Stop saying that! We'll be leaving for Malaysia next month. Before that, I want to go back to China... to say goodbye to the folks. That's good. Help me to burn a stick of incense for my parents at their tomb. And don't forget to buy a chicken for them. Lee! Lee! You scared me to death! It's been a long time, so I came to see what's going on. Lee... you met Dong a few days back. - So how was it? - What do you mean? I would like to know how much money I can get. The sum must be big... even the police are offering a reward of seven hundred thousand! What do you mean by that? Are you trying to be an informant? How can I be such a person? The police already came to see me, but I didn't tell them anything. I took part in this job, how could I be an informant? Lee, how much can I get? Lee? How much can I get? Let's not talk about it! They divided it into seven shares. Those guys gave Kiong his share, and you'll get nothing out of it! I tried reasoning with them, then they pulled out a grenade! I couldn't fight them single-handedly! How could they bully me like that? Here is some money for you. After a few days, I'll settle your share with Dong. - Alright, I'll wait for your call. - Okay. Lee, don't forget to call me! Don't worry. Hello, I would like to book an air ticket for one person. Dong, are you free tonight? Come out and have some beer. Anything to discuss? Just come, alright? Kuan has gone back to his hometown, I'm so lonely. The police are still trying to find us, you better stay at home. Don't talk so much! Just come! - Drink up! - Okay! Darn you! What do you want from me, sir? Any information regarding the robbery? What information? Go to hell! Don't try to pretend! I'll ask you one more time, any news regarding the Hang Seng robbery case? Ding, don't forget... you had a bad record. You know what to do. - Let's go. - Be smart! Police? So what? Police can't simply beat people up! You are an informant! What did you tell the police? I didn't say anything! But where is my share? I worked so hard but never got a dime! Go to hell! Move away! There is nothing to see! I don't care what the outcome is. I tried so hard to come to Hong Kong... I'd rather die than to spend the rest of my life in jail! Don't worry. Why did you fight with people? You're talking rubbish! You still want to pretend? Everybody saw you fighting! Sir. - Keep an eye on him! - Yes, sir! Sir! Well, that guy you just arrested, did he say anything? He didn't say anything. A report from the hospital said that the guy he fought with is dead. We've confirmed the deceased is one of the robbers. And the bullet found in his head... matched the one found at the tunnel. We suspect the deceased is related to the robbery. Focus on him. We might find some clues from him. Yes, sir! Cheng sir! The hospital report said... the man you fought with at the bar is dead. Now we're charging you with murder. Sir, I didn't kill anyone! We have solid evidence to prove that... the deceased was involved with the robbery. And we suspect that you were involved too. You killed that man over the spoils, right? Sir, I didn't join in the robbery! You better tell me everything you know, maybe I can help you. If your information is vital, you can go free... and even get a seven hundred thousand dollar reward. Sir, I only helped them to find the cars. Who are they? We've received reliable sources... and we have decided to take action tonight! From now on, you're on duty for twenty-four hours. Every one of you should lead a team for action. To prevent leaking information, you'll know the details just before action. Squad! Attention! The operation begins! Remember, the robbers are vicious! If they refuse to surrender, shoot to kill! Police, don't move! Don't move! Lean against the wall! Don't move! Why did you kill Kiong? Why? - I had no choice. - What do you mean by no choice? He was badly wounded at that time. He only had two choices. One was death... and the other was to get arrested. I believe he would choose the first option. How did you know that? I have nothing to say. If you think that I was wrong to kill him... you can kill me now! Can you tell us your view towards your arrest by the police? I don't have any particular view. The police were just doing their job. It's just that we were in different positions. I don't blame them for arresting me. If I were in their position... I would do the same thing. I would not let them escape. - They are here! - Go! Hurry up! Let's run! This way! Let's run! Let's run! Hurry up! The famous Hang Seng bank robbery... happened on August fifth, 1975. It shocked Hong Kong and the whole world. Forty-five days after the robbery... on September twentieth, 1975... six robbers were arrested except for one... who escaped during the robbery. In June 1976, the case was closed in court. Six of them were sentenced... to twenty-five years imprisonment. But they appealed to the court. The judge, on account... of their clean record... reduced their sentence by five years. In June 1989, they were released. But the escapee was still at large.
