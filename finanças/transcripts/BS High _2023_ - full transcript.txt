It sounds like an old pimp. Bishop Sycamore. They got on ESPN and got their asses wiped out. End zone, hauled in by Tate with one hand. Low throw. It's caught. And reaching across the goal line, touchdown! Bishop Sycamore, they're a bit of a mystery in this game. When did ESPN start producing comedy? Get right back out! Get that shit out! Bishop Sycamore told us they had a number of Division I prospects. Look at this shit! A lot of that we could not verify. Reports are now claiming Bishop Sycamore is not even a real high school. No facilities, no building, kids staying in hotels. And they're not actually high school players? How does this get on ESPN? How does that happen? There's got to be a point now, Lugs, where you do worry about health and safety. I already am worried about it. I do honestly feel bad for them.

Sitting in front of a camera and talking is probably his ideal scenario. Do I really want to be famous? Do I really want people to see me? Did me wanting to be so loved and seen and people like me and all that, that good feeling and all that, trump everything else? I used to be a local news reporter in Columbus, Ohio, and I was one of the first people to cover the story. Roy could absolutely be the next in a long line of people to fall on their own sword on a national scale because he talks too much in a documentary. A lot of Roy Johnson is anecdotal, right?

Growing up, we went to a church on the corner of these two streets, and I can hear my mom singing right now. And my brother and I would be champing at the bit to get out of night service before the streetlights came on. So we could go play football. My brother is the best football player that I've ever seen. Fast, strong, relentless. And he was cold-blooded. As a big brother, I wanted to make sure that I could take his talent and put it on a bigger pedestal. I'm telling the little kid, undersized kid in New York, "You gonna play for Ohio State one day." "Are you sure, Roy?" "Follow me." How many times I went to talk to teachers because they failed him, and then when he couldn't play football, I had to go beg teachers to get his grades up. So when my brother went to Ohio State, I saw that high school football changes lives because it provides opportunities to get higher education. When I started this whole thing, for me, it was an opportunity to take it from my brother or two or three kids to helping an entire football team, an entire school. I had been working for the African Methodist Episcopal Church for about three or four years, just doing random projects to help. So, they came to me and said, "Hey, we're thinking about opening a school called Christians of Faith to help young men get an education, go to college." At this point, you know, working, years working with my brother, getting him into college and getting young people into college through the avenue of football, I was like, "Hey, you know, I don't mind working on this project, but we have to add a football element to it." The first day I met Roy, it was after a football game. He just said he always wanted to have a team. He wanted to impact kids. I had coached for a long time, and I was like, "Oh, that's easy. I can tell you how to do that." For me, it was an opportunity to have a Christian school powerhouse. And what better place to do that than Ohio? We talked about this, I mean, every single day. I mean, to two at night sometimes. And my wife is over there and she's like, "Hey, man, look, just let me know. You and Roy got something going on. What's going on? Is it Roy or is it Regina?" Tell me about John Branham Sr. And his role in this process. - Who? John Branham Sr. Who's John Branham Sr.? Of course, he would say that, because he knows I know the beginning. I know every ins and outs. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. He, um, he was around for a few weeks. He was helping us out with advice. Real smart. I can't say a few weeks. That wouldn't be right. So... six months, seven months maybe. The goal was to get the school started and sports to come in about two to three years. He was like, "You're talking about a 150-million-dollar project. It takes years to build something like this." The money was supposed to come from people getting insurance policies through the church and leaving that money to the school. So, "Hey, you want to help out the school? Take out a 100,000 dollar life insurance policy. You can leave whatever percentages to your family and then leave a certain percentage to the school." So then he gives me a list of things that we're going to need. And once he gave me that list, it's just like anything else. Just go get it. ♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ So I get into my Hannibal mode, just putting the grind on and getting out there. Kept talking to people, talking to people, talking to people. We had people calling from other states like, "Hey man, I want to coach, I want to help you guys." And we hadn't started anything. We had got engineers and architects to draw up this facility. And the facility had a rooftop basketball court and little ponds for kids to go fishing in. The idea was that if the facility is really good, it'll help draw in the players. It would probably cost hundreds of millions of dollars to do something like what they were talking about. Especially to build, like, physically build a school, a building, a field, like, renovate a whole thing. Next thing I know, I get a call from Roy. He's like, "Branham, that place you took me to, SuperKick, the indoor facility, we're going to rent that for the kids to practice." I said, "Yo, man, what kids?" ♪ (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ I go up to SuperKick indoor facility. There was a bus, like a tour bus, with kids getting off the bus, coming to practice. And I'm sitting there like, "What the hell?" This is not what we were supposed to create. I was going to choke his ass. How can you go and coach a team of young kids and you know it's not a school. It's my philosophy of business is, do what the people who have the money do, even if you don't have the money. I trusted Roy all up into the point where I didn't trust him. I'm insecure, I'm an extremist, and I'm very resourceful. And that's a bad combination. I... I remember the first day that I learned about COF Academy, which was probably the same time I learned who Roy Johnson was. COF Academy was Christians of Faith Academy, which was the precursor to Bishop Sycamore. ♪ (WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Ben Ferree is a former investigator for the Ohio High School Athletic Association. He said he began looking at Bishop Sycamore's predecessor years ago. I worked at the Ohio High School Athletic Association for eight years. It was my job and, uh, I was pretty good at my job. So I knew a lot about high school sports. The Ohio High School Athletic Association is the governing body for high school sports in the state of Ohio. Its general mission is to have some sort of fairness in the competitive landscape to protect the players, to protect the schools. I met Ben when I was a freshman in college. Um, he was a year older than me, and he also worked on the newspaper. Ben loves rules. He loves, like, minutia and, like, following the rules and being like, "Hey, look at this weird thing." He's like a little puppy who, like, finds things, and then just like dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digs. It was, I think, the summer of 2018 and Ben was doing this job at the OHSAA, where he always wound up with weird stories. One day, he just sent something to the group chat, like, "I have this really weird school that is, like, a brand-new school and says they're D1 with 750 kids." And it was very clear, very fast that this was one of those things that Ben was going to sink his teeth into. I was intrigued by Roy, um, because he... he opened my mind to what fraud could be. I had no idea the depths with which you could get away with things. And his life provided a fantastic case study for all the flaws of the legal system. Let's go, everybody, let's go, let's go. Here you go. Three, two, one. Yellow, let's go. I met Roy at an indoor soccer training place called SuperKick. - They were having a media day. And I get there, and it's all just sort of, like, chaos. There's like, kids running around, people with clipboards and stuff, but there wasn't any organization or anything. And there was basically no other media there at all. It was pretty much just me and someone that they had hired to do video for them. Roy was sharper than most of anybody I've ever met. He knew what to say, how to say it. Um, he knew how to talk about things that were way beyond me as far as how to build a school and what hoops and things you had to jump through. We actually met at a Panera Bread. This dude had long Adidas socks on, gym shorts and a big Iron Man T-shirt. So, he sat down, but the moment the guy started talking, we were both impressed. We were ready to go. Talked for two or three hours. Really sold us on the vision. We had the proposal ready and he saw the number on it. Didn't even flinch about it. He's like, "I'm going to go to the bank. I'm gonna get you guys squared away within the next month. No problem." Anthony and I walk out into the parking lot, and we just closed the biggest deal of our life, man. The plan was to have them get as much film as they could, and then put it all together and see what we could do with it. He... He said, "You're going to get us on Netflix." I was like... "All right." Yeah, right? Maybe one day get it on HBO or Netflix or whatever, right? It seemed like we were gonna kind of build... You know, you don't want to say the communications department of the school, but it kind of was that. Um, kind of be the creative directors of the school that's about to start, that's supposed to be an IMG Academy of Columbus, Ohio. This here is a brotherhood. ♪ (INTENSE MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We hold ourselves to a higher standard than anyone could ever set for us. Work harder. Get stronger. Be smarter. Play faster. - Dream bigger. ♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪ IMG Academy is a school that was built to be an academic arm of what is basically a sports academy. They are probably the most known school in the country when it comes to athletics. They have the best facilities, the best schedule, the best trainers, always one of the top-ranked teams, gets kids to college, gets kids to the NFL. Nothing about IMG seems like a high school. It seems like a professional team. Like, if you look at the facilities they have, they're as good as any college or pro team. They're kind of like the establishment, and they're what COF Academy was essentially striving to be. There might not be that many schools in America that are as high profile as IMG Academy, but the same concept applies to dozens or hundreds of schools around the country. All of these schools exist for the same purpose, which is to play football. And education, or taking care of the kids, or any of that stuff, is secondary. I think Roy looked at IMG Academy and he said, "Why can't I do that?" But with kids from bad backgrounds. With COF Academy, their target demo was athletes who were good at football or thought they were good at football, but were not going on to play at the next level. Be that because they didn't have the grades to get into college or didn't have the grades to academically qualify, or be that maybe they didn't have any offers to play at the next level but felt that they should. And that's really the dream that they sold them on, was, "We will get you into a D1 school." "If you come here, we're going to get you into big schools. We're going to bring in top talent. We're going to bring in the D1 talent. We're going to rival IMG." So, when people say D1 or Division I, they're really talking about the highest levels of college football. These are the schools that you see on television. That's where people see you. That's where you get measures of fame and celeb. If Christians of Faith does begin placing multiple kids in D1 programs, then Roy all of a sudden becomes a nationally known high school coach, that you go play football for Roy Johnson, he can get you into D1 programs. That would have a lot of cachet. Go. So, I walked around, talked to other coaches like, "Y'all do understand there is no school." He's like, "Oh, man, you know, you gotta... You got to let that go." I said, "I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna let go. I'm gonna let go of his neck after I grab it." So he left, and then the other people working on the projects, they left. And then it was just these couple of parents and myself. - ♪ (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ The real shocker came when the AME Church issued their statement, saying they had no involvement with COF Academy.

For all intents and purposes, they were. It was run by the exact same people. In their first year of existence, Bishop Sycamore was wearing COF Academy's equipment. Because COF ended so badly, I kicked up the notch on recruitment. When we looked at the young men that we were bringing into the program, it was something in their life that wasn't right. They had an unhealthy home life. They had bad grades. They needed more film because they didn't play a lot. The end goal was they wanted to go to college.

If you don't have hunger, you can't become a man. You got to eat in this world. So I'm gonna eat. Where I'm from, opportunities don't come around. So when you have an opportunity, you got to capitalize on it. And that's what I was trying to do. Coming from a broken household, getting evicted back-to-back, and so football is just a way to help get my mind away from everything that was going on at home. When I was seven years old, my dad caught a murder charge, or homicide. So football was the only way that I had, a... a male support. That was where I was getting disciplined.

They dream of being famous. And you sell them the idea that, "Hey, I'm going to get you to these places that will give you the chance to get there. All you have to do is work hard." I got promised that I'd be at a big-time school. I'd be D1. Basically, I got promised everything you will want to hear. Well, he called my mom. He was telling her, "Oh, we're supposed to be playing a big-time school called IMG." I took the phone, I was like, "Yo, IMG is a dream school, I always wanted to play against them or play with them." So, I went to learn, to better myself and to play football, to get a... a scholarship, to go D1. If you go to Bishop Sycamore's Twitter page, it is literally just hundreds of messages tweeting at players, "Hey, DM me. Hey, DM me. Hey, DM me." The dream that they sold them on was, "We will get you into a D1 school." He was saying, uh, "You just come and play ball... and we're going to get you to school." He was just selling me a dream. At the time, you know, I was in a lost space. So I took it as a chance for me to start something new. I looked at my mom, I said, "It's gonna be the biggest opportunity. You know, it's going to be life-changing for me." Coach Roy DM'd me on Instagram. "Hey, what's up, bro? I want to fly you out and let you come to our school. This school I'm building up, all-Black coaching staff, I want to build it up." I'm like, "All right. Bet, bet, bet." You know, it sounds like a fairytale story. Damn, I got this opportunity and I don't have nothing else. I'm just home.

Because I didn't pay the bills. Why didn't you pay the bills? I don't know. Might've been I didn't have the money. Didn't care. Lazy, arrogance. There's a lot that goes into it. I would literally have to look at all 30 lawsuits and look down and look at 'em. What does it feel like to be a co... Well, actually, are you a con man? No, that's not, like, my trade or profession. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm... No, you know, I'm dodging it. - Roy is absolutely a con man. Is he any good at it? That's a great question. He's kind of good at it and kind of awful at it. I'm not sure what the name of the television show is exactly, but I think one of the terms is nigga-ish. So I'm not a con man. I'm con man-ish. - ♪ (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Man, there's some hustles I could tell you about, man, that I did. And that's what they were. They were hustles, man. You know, I would call a grocery store in the morning and say, "Hey, I need to order 25 rotisserie chickens." And they will order the 25 rotisserie chickens and cook them. And then I wouldn't pick them up, and then I would show up when the deli closed like six, seven o'clock, because I knew, at night, they would mark them down to two dollars apiece. But I didn't... I mean, I didn't have a choice. Where am I going to find food to feed 50 kids? Originally, everything was supposed to be catered, have all these meals and whatnot. But we found out that it wasn't like that. It seemed like these kids got fed, but it was whenever Roy could make it happen. When we first started, we were usually getting fed pasta. I was eating pizza and pasta every day. The mac and cheese would get put out because nobody would eat it. And then that same night, it's reheated and it's there like four nights later. I saw pictures that he would send me and I'd be like... - "What is that?" - It's not oatmeal. I don't know. I don't even know what we ate that day. Like, it was a porridge? A whole bunch of food like mixed together, - like, just try it out. - We out there playing football. Ain't nobody really got any money or anything. And where I'm from, it's only one way, so... They going to Walmart, they stealing, Kroger, stealing it. There got a time we all got kicked out of Walmart like none of us could go in there. We had to steal TV dinners and stuff like that, chicken and stuff. With financial backing comes stability. And once that didn't happen, it was almost like they were on an island by their self, surrounded by water. And now you have to learn how to survive or you have to learn how to, you know, do whatever you can to get out of it, get off the island. Coach Roy and Mr. Peterson told me that they would be able to help me get my ACT score up as well as get extra tape. Get to those colleges that I wanted to go to. For the school, it's... it's... It began with meeting the needs of those kids. One, two, three... To my understanding, there were no educational standards. They did not have teachers. They did not provide any education themselves. The school that we visited months before we got there was not at all the school that we, quote, unquote, "attended." The school that we actually attended, it was called YouthBuild. In 2019, the first year of Bishop Sycamore, they claimed that they were going to be the athletic arm of YouthBuild. It was a school for kids that got locked up during high school and kids that probably dropped out and just wanted to get a GED. Bishop Sycamore started running up bills in YouthBuild's name, and expecting them to pay for things that YouthBuild had not agreed to pay for. And so almost as soon as it started, the partnership was dissolved. We never really had like a teacher to help us for our ACT. We really was pretty much on our own. Coming in, I told him, "I need to move my GPA from here to here." You know, he told me, you know, "We have a trusted, accredited source to bring your grades up." And I said, "Okay, I'm gonna put all my marbles in one basket. Imma trust you with this." In its paperwork, it says students go to class from 7:10 a.m. to 3:05 p.m. at Franklin University's library. We're supposed to be going to a school called Franklin University, and Roy's telling us, "Okay, this is the building where we'll be taking our classes at." We get there and the doors are locked, we can't get in, so. You guys never had any type of brick-and-mortar school location in... in the entire process? No. Look, you tell a teenager, "You don't have to go to school anymore," they're not going to stop and say, "But wait a minute, there are consequences to this." No. They're like, "Cool. I don't have to go to school anymore." They figured everything would be taken care of because the grown folk on duty said that everything would be taken care of. Three games into the season and we haven't touched a single academic assignment. - We don't have any laptops. We don't really have a solid place for everyone to, um, everyone to do work. There's no teachers. So I'm kind of iffy about it, but I don't want to go tell my mom. I'm like, "Oh, I'm not doing school." I don't necessarily think there was a gap between what was promised and what was delivered. Um... I... I guess... I guess in a way you could... You... You probably could say that, I guess. If these were individuals who were under the age of 18, you have a legal obligation to provide them a very strict framework and make sure that they're doing what they need to do because they're not adults yet. The brain isn't fully formed. But one of the things that Bishop Sycamore and COF Academy would always dance around was the age of their players. Notably, they filled out on their paperwork in 2020 that they had three students and in 2021 that they had one. Now, obviously, there was more than three people out on the football field. So why weren't all these players on Bishop Sycamore being considered truant? The answer would be, if they were all already out of school and over-aged. I already graduated from high school. So, Coach Roy trying to search up classes for us at YouthBuild down in Columbus. They tried to find us classes so we could look like a real high school. Roy would tell people, "We... we don't have graduates on our team, we don't have players over 19 on our team. We are just a high school like any other." Hard work on three. - One, two, three. Hard work! There were remarks made at practice like, "We're going to go out there and play a bunch of 17 and 18-year-olds and whoop the shit out of them." Which kind of led you to believe that... these kids might be grown men. And, obviously, you know, the way they look, they looked old. You could definitely see it. There were players with children, one that just came out of jail. Just something you can look at and see, like, this isn't a high school program. Ben Ferree said you guys had players who were too old? - Mm-hmm? Junior college players that were playing in your team, is that true? It's not true. Ben Ferree doesn't know what the hell he's talking about. One that stands out to me who did play for Bishop Sycamore in 2021, his name is Mecose Todd. He was listed as playing at a JuCo, a junior college. He was listed at that college as a sophomore. What are the odds that someone two years removed from high school is age-eligible for high school athletics still? You know Mecose was already in JuCo. And you know I played at JuCo. And you know this stuff. When you're in JuCo, you can't go back to high school. Like, that's... That's basically your clock has already started. It always felt like we were not supposed to be doing things that we were doing. Looking, looking, looking. Gets hit from behind and sacked. There are some big boys. What do these kids eat? I knew I wasn't eligible to play high school football. But what he kind of made it seem like was that he had a prep team as well as a high school team that was playing. So our school was a hybrid of a high school-prep school. I don't understand how people just buy into that hook, line, and sinker. There's no such thing as a hybrid high school-prep team. That does not exist. If there's one prep school player on a team, it is a prep school. You're bringing 20, 21-year-olds out here to compete against 15, 16, 17-year-olds. Like, that is flatly wrong. But it's masked by the fact that they weren't good. But there was still somebody on the other side of this 20-year-old who probably looked up and was like, "Damn, that dude looks old." The lie is when you tell people that you are a school, and then when you compound on that lie by saying "We are a high school." What's the high school age limit? Does anybody know? Is there some type of organization that says how old you have to be to play high school football? Where's that manual? Does anybody have that? In OHSAA regulations, you can be 19 years old and play. The day you turn 20, you are no longer eligible to play high school athletics. Cool. What's that have to do with us? We're not OHSAA. So what are you talking about? What, to play with OHSAA school? I'm not OHSAA. We weren't OHSAA. There was nothing about us that was OHSAA. I didn't belong to OHSAA, I wasn't a OHSAA member. Everything about that organization is just disgusting. And then they run around and call themselves the state, but they're not even governed by the state, they're just an association. Did I break a law? Is it illegal? Am I in jail? Some things, there aren't laws against because people lack the imagination that anyone is unscrupulous enough to do them. No, it's just Ben Ferree, OHSAA, and what they thought is your opinion. Roy, the issue is that you lie. I think I'm the most honest liar that I know. So if you ask me if I'm a liar, or have I lied? Yeah, absolutely. But I would tell you that. My core value is loyalty. So I wouldn't lie to somebody I'm loyal to. Or more importantly, I don't think I would lie to somebody who is loyal to me. Roy will tell you he's a liar. And then Roy will say, "I'm a liar. So I know that I need to tell the truth about X, Y, Z, because you'll just look into me because I'm a liar." I will not lie about something I can prove. I'm not going to tell you we did something and we didn't - when I can prove it. - But you're comfortable to lie about things that can't be proven. Yes. My name is Joe Maimone. I'm a matchmaker to the top teams in America in the world of high school football. I had heard of Bishop Sycamore, just from being in the business. Roy called me, we started talking. He told me, "I want to assemble the best schedule in the history of high school football." They didn't care about winning or losing. They just wanted to experience playing the best. Play against good teams, that gives you good varsity film. Big throw from Harris. - Caught at the end zone! On one level, you can be a coach that says, "I want my kids to compete against the best of the best." But the adults in the room are the ones who have to look around and say, "Nah, we don't need to do that." And you can do that in basketball or chess or something else that doesn't involve getting hit in the kidneys. Like in this... this... There are different consequences to this. IMG is one of the toughest teams in America to schedule for, because of how good they are. So I surround myself with those type of clients who want to play the IMGs of the world. Even though you lose to IMG, if you're playing well against one of their top players, that can get you a scholarship somewhere. The exposure helps. The only thing is, if you're not that good, exposure means getting exposed. Do you know why IMG played us in the Canton Hall of Fame? Because nobody else in Ohio wanted to play them. They think it's a finesse thing, right? "How did you finesse your way onto ESPN?" I didn't. They called us. After assembling Bishop Sycamore's 2021 schedule, it was ranked the fourth toughest schedule in America. Not only were they playing IMG, they were playing a team from Texas, they were playing a team from Las Vegas, they were going down to Maryland. It was a great schedule, one of the best I've ever put together for any team. We're on ESPN... playing at the Canton Hall of Fame. Win, lose, or draw, we win. We're there. We win. I love it when a plan comes together. The first game of the season - was at Archbishop Hoban. Harris looking under pressure. Scrambles and dropped down at about the 45. They're a really good team. They've had about four or five state championships. There I'm playing against the top programs in the country. Let's go. The second game on my schedule is IMG. It was an opportunity for me against IMG to go in there and showcase who I really am. But the week of, Roy tells us we got another game on Friday. He's like, "Yeah, we're gonna take this game to get prepared for IMG. They had scheduled individually, on their own, the Pennsylvania team on Friday. This to me was one of the craziest things to come of this. It was finding out that they had played two football games in a span of three days. Had no idea about it and would definitely would have talked them out of it or let them know my feelings, uh, not to do it. Especially when you're playing a top-five team in America 48 hours later. Welcome to the Woodland Hills Showcase. Tonight's first matchup is going to be Bishop Sycamore versus Sto-Rox. Every single snap, you are ramming your body into somebody else, and you're doing that a hundred times a game. Bishop Sycamore comes out being led by their quarterback, Trilian Harris. Teams are playing two games within one week, but not Friday, Sunday. Not that small a window. You need time to recuperate from one game to play the other. I've been around the game a long time and I've never witnessed a team that played two games back-to-back. Shotgun formation. Harris gets the snap. He's under pressure. And he's taken down! You wanna know what that feels like? Go run into a wall 30 times and then come back two days later and say, "Yeah, I'll do that again." Except this time, against a much sturdier wall. If it was such a big concern that they should only play one game per week, then you should make that a national law and rule, the health people should come in and say all that, and guess what I would do? "Hey, bro, we can't play these two games. We can't do that, because it's against the law." But they didn't make it illegal, so we played the game. There's no law saying you can't play football games within 48 hours of each other. There's no law saying you can't, you know, drive a nail into your leg. People just don't do it because it's stupid and unhealthy. You could not demonstrate less of a regard for the safety of your players than having them play two tackle football games in a span of three days. People were sharing helmets because we were lied to, saying that we had, um, equipment on the way. Trilian had to wear his helmet that he had in high school that I bought him, that I know it wasn't registered, and it wasn't a certified helmet for this season. And his helmet comes off! I can't believe this happened again. Uh, were players sharing helmets? Yes. Is that dangerous? Football is dangerous. Yeah. And that'll just about do it here. The Sto-Rox Vikings come out and get a victory against Bishop Sycamore. There weren't safety concerns because there just wasn't anyone paying attention. There wasn't enough eyeballs on it. When it's on ESPN and... and you have millions of people seeing the horrible situation, then it gets a little more spotlight on it. Welcome to Canton, Ohio, home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. IMG Academy out of Florida, a powerhouse, against Bishop Sycamore from Ohio. And all of a sudden, we see that Bishop Sycamore has scheduled IMG Academy at Hall of Fame Stadium on ESPN. Dude, we can't miss that. That's Roy Johnson's idea coming to fruition. What if they're good? I was sitting at home, I was like, "I'm gonna binge-watch something." I made me some lemonade, got my cookies on deck. And then all of a sudden, I saw Roy drinking the water. And I'm telling you, I dropped my cookies and the first words I... I yelled at my wife, "Hey, man, the clown's on TV doing this thing." Roy Johnson, the head coach for Bishop Sycamore, they're a bit of a mystery in this game. Roy, how did you pull this off? I don't know. I don't know how you did it, but, like, it was amazing. You watch them growing up. Like, everybody watches the IMG Academy growing up. So you know you're playing against the best school in the nation. So it was definitely surreal. I was happy for Roy. I was happy for the boys, happy for the coaches. So, it was like... It was emotional. Like, I remember coming out of the tunnel. Before I got to the tunnel, my wife looked at me and I just... And I just burst into tears. Trilian was extremely excited. That's all he could talk about. That's all he could post on Twitter. It's what we do from the West to the Midwest. So, we're going up, baby. Let's turn this up. You see the one-three. Let's fuckin' go! The day IMG game, waking up. It's a lot of nerves. So I said a prayer and I went to the mirror. I'm looking. I'm... You know, my eyes is getting watery. I'm looking. I'm like, "It's the biggest day of your life, bruh." Let's go! The day of competition is a big deal. Now, you take this and you make it teenagers, and you tell them that they are being put on the most important stage in American life. Television. I'm so hyped right now. Just imagine all the emotions that come up with that, because TV confers an authority in this country. Be legendary on me. Be legendary on three. One, two, three! Bishop Sycamore will kick it off and IMG Academy will receive. Going to the game, I think everybody thought we had a big chance of winning. Like, everybody's hopes were high. You don't go into this game thinking that you can't win. I've never thought that we couldn't win. He honestly and truthfully thought that we were gonna go into the IMG game and stand a chance. How likely is it they could have beaten IMG? They hadn't won a game in two years and now they were gonna fight the champ. End zone. Hauled in by Tate with one hand. I'm playing against one of the top programs in the country. And now if I beat them, I'm the man, you know? If I beat them, I'm a dog out here, man. I'm gonna get the most respect out here. I saw that as a chance, like, to really prove myself that I'm that dude. It's my only shot, for real. This is my chance. First time we get to see this offense. Trilian Harris is their quarterback. History is written by the winners. It's not written by the losers. On second and nine. Harris gets rid of it, completes near sideline. If we win, sponsors are different, signing day is different. People congratulating us. Fourth and one from inside its own 30. Bishop Sycamore will go for it. If you hear Roy Johnson just beat IMG Academy, now my school automatically is the top school. And IMG will take over. The ball comes out. It's gonna be a tall order for this Bishop Sycamore offensive line to hold up throughout the course of four quarters. If Bishop Sycamore had beaten IMG Academy, it would have been the proudest moment of Roy Johnson's life. ESPN would be running around like, "We had this flagship team that we brought on." Underdogs and all that. Yeah. New York Times is talking about Roy Johnson, the genius. "Look how he's helped these kids recover." But that definitely didn't happen. Low throw. It's caught. And reaching across the goal line, it's Carnell Tate. The injured player for Bishop Sycamore is number 54. We do not have a 54 on the roster we were given. Safety comes first with football, but we didn't have any trainers. Actually, the IMG game, my mom was the trainer. One of the staff members from the stadium came in and he was like, "Where are your trainers?" I said, "I am the trainer." And he was like, "What? They're supposed to be supplied. They were supposed to get somebody out here, you know, if somebody got injured." And I was like, "Well, that didn't happen." First ten minutes of the game, one of the kids tore his ACL. It was a bad knee injury and Roy was just out there with some of the coaches. No medical staff, nobody out there. A red zone chance for IMG. Still fighting into the end zone from 12 yards out. This is throwing a bantamweight with just a few fights under its belt into the ring against essentially your heavyweight champion. At that moment, I was extremely concerned. From the 15, Harris will throw. Backpedaling. Jihaad Campbell gets the sack. And Trilian Harris, the quarterback for Bishop Sycamore, limping on the sideline. I'm gonna sit back there and take them hits, but I'm gonna get back up. I'm gonna get back up. I'm gonna keep playin'. Play me. I don't give a fuck. I don't care. 'Cause in that moment, I'm like, "Bro, I can't go out like this. I can't." And I want college coaches to know that, okay, at least he a dog. Harris heaves it down field. Incomplete. As I was throwing the ball, my arm came up and my shoulder came down. I felt the pop. So I'm dangling my arm. You can tell. Like, you know, you can tell it that I'm hurt. End of the second quarter, Trilian goes up for a pass. The linebacker came and hit him in his shoulder. As he was off the field, he threw his helmet. He, you know, was like, "I'm good. I'm good. I'm going back in the game, I'm going back in the game." I was like, "No, you're not." I don't care if we got whooped a hundred to zero. All I know is I wanted to go out fighting as a dog. The coaches, of course, let him go back in. I was like, "He is not going back in this game." We get a new quarterback here, - Isaiah Booker. He's listed as a receiver or a defensive back on the roster. Right. Not even listed as a quarterback. My backup, he broke his ankle. But we are seeing Isaiah Booker here. He is under pressure and gobbled up. The inherent danger right now. That looked like a young man not prepared to face this kind of a defense. The thing about watching football is you recognize there's a chance that somebody is going to be hurt. But when you watch one team just be physically superior in every way to another team, and it's clear that that team can't compete, you felt like the referee should have been coming in or somebody should've thrown in a towel and said, "Hey, man, this is enough. Our guys can't do it." Now, it's on the coaches. You know, you say you care about us, but did you really? I go to the sideline, tell the coach, "I felt my knee pop." "If it ain't hurting, you good." So, I go back out there. Then come to find out I tore my ACL. I'm telling him, "It popped." Not one coach said, "Don't go back out there." It was disgusting. I was literally sick to my stomach watching it. Driven hard out of bounds. Quarter number two comes to an end. Halftime came and he literally cussed the kids out. We come in at halftime. My phone is blowing up. Fake school this. Fake school that. I got over a thousand messages in my requests. I'm thinking to myself, like, man, it's halftime. We will have a running clock here in the third quarter. IMG to kick off to Bishop Sycamore. There were media outlets that I had reached out to telling them, "This is a fake school. You need to cover this," that just completely blew me off and said, "No, we're not running a story on it." Gage reaching and he is in. So to see it go viral simply because it existed on ESPN when they could have run that story any time in the last three years. That was just like, "Go fuck yourself." Trending on Twitter, seeing my name, you know, it hurt. Grown men tweeting my son that he should go kill himself. He is never gonna be shit. Like, "You suck. You're a Bishop Sycamore quarterback." Jonathan Mambila in there now at quarterback. Also listed as a defensive back wide receiver. Too high, tipped, intercepted. People got the narrative that I'm a grown man. People got the narrative that I'm a JuCo dropout. These are grown-ass men losing to fucking high schoolers. Hill handed off. It's Gage and he'll waltz in. You 20 years old, 21, and you playing high school kids, they smacking you around on the field? Man, get out of here with that nonsense! This is not a representation or a microcosm in any way, shape, or form of Ohio High School Football. It takes a lot for a broadcast crew to be critical of what they are seeing in real time. Nobody knows who Bishop Sycamore is. The last thing you want is to have this be representative of the image your program projects going forward. It had to be so transparently fraudulent that people who were on the payroll to promote this event could not keep up the story. They get it right back. Makes it a pick six. I would be stunned if Bishop Sycamore ever plays another football game. And that will do it. The absurdity kept stacking and stacking and stacking, and it couldn't have possibly been funnier. If I was a viewer, I'm clowning me. Like I'm... I'm... I'm clowning me. And then we found out what this meant to the kids. I'm not even Adrian Brown. People see me as Bishop Sycamore, the fake school. Y'all are gonna be clowned forever. What amazes me about this particular con is the dream for this con was for everybody to see it. The fallout after the team's blowout loss continues. Who is this team? What sort of education are these players getting? And it will be interesting to see if there's a criminal investigation. - Maybe from a fraud standpoint. Yeah. Were they raising money under false pretenses and not delivering it? Now, we can tell you they have fired their head coach. Teams scheduled to play Bishop Sycamore canceled their games following last week's televised loss. The Fairfield Inn & Suites in Canton alleged that the team used counterfeit checks to pay for its stay during its matchup against IMG Academy. ♪ (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ The day before the IMG and Bishop Sycamore game, Roy asked me to pick him up. He needed to go get a check, which in my mind is like, okay, you're gonna go to the bank. He's like, "No, let's stop over at Kinko's." I'm like, "That's weird," 'cause that's just printing. And he told me in my ear when he did this that it was a hot check and that it was going to pay for the hotel through Education Resource. Education Resource was what his mom created. It was a nonprofit organization. But she passed away, so he gained control of the business. And I was like, "So you're printing off a check?" He was like, "Yeah, we have to print off a check to give to the hotel." He was like, "Oh, no. It's good. It's good. It'll get taken care of. I just... We'll just have to move money around, but these are gonna bounce." I'm like, "Well, I don't wanna be a part of that." Did you print fake checks - to pay the hotel in, uh... - Canton, Ohio? Canton, Ohio? - No. What were you printing at Kinko's then? At Kinko's? It was the... That's like the account numbers for the account that we had. You put it on the check and then pay them. But we ended up paying with credit card. They needed something to hold it. We know the checks didn't go through. - That's what we know. - It's not attempted fraud. The account was valid, there's money in the account. - They know that. They never had a bad check. And I don't know who told you about Kinko's, 'cause that's not right either. There's no doubt in my mind that Roy knowingly bounced those checks. Anything that Roy could not pay, he did not pay. A lawsuit alleged Coach Roy Johnson owed 110,000 dollars in hotel fees at this Baymont Inn. I think every place the team stayed at, where you would have to pay money to stay, they were evicted from. We would move the kids in and get the first two months free, whatever it is. And then, you know, you're thinking that by that time that you would have the funding coming in to continue that. Getting evicted three months in is about as quick as you can get evicted. That means you never paid a single bill. Hey, we can go to these places and live there for three months and not have to pay a dime. And that's about the length of the football season. Then we're out of there. And that's what they did. Roy told everybody, "This the end of the season. We got like two days to get out." I walked past the front desk lady after I packed my things up. And she's like, "Do you know why you guys are getting kicked out?" And then she was like, "He hasn't paid." Since like we literally first got there. Uh, home. Everybody went home. Some of these evictions are in these kids' names. That's something on your record as an individual that could affect your credit, that could affect your ability to get financing in the future, that could affect your ability on where you can live, what kind of apartments you can rent in the future. I know about the eviction thing. I know about that. Because after they all moved out, we didn't pay for the next month and so they had to file an eviction. That's just how the process works. You had dealt with them. You made sure that they were cool. - Yeah, they were... Yeah... They were situated after that. Yeah, they were situated home. They were taken care of. - And they were taken care of. Yeah, the eviction didn't happen till after. Yeah. Me getting evicted with the eviction notice on the door, it was more so like, "We're getting kicked out, what we gonna do?" I didn't know the eviction was on my record till my mom told me. She starts yellin' at me. I'm like, "What are you yellin' at me for? I don't know what you're talking about." And then you had to get a... Mr. Peterson got an attorney. The attorney went to court, dealt with the court situation, and then we moved on. He had a lawyer. Bishop Sycamore, rather, had a lawyer to help them with the eviction cases. That lawyer then had to turn around and sue them for not paying him for helping them in the eviction cases! He would try to be buddy-buddy with the kids, telling them things that he does, making it seem like it's okay to get away with that type of stuff. Coach Roy made it feel like it was okay to be a criminal. Like as long as we was gettin' this money. Like, we getting this money by any means. Like, that's the thing. By any means. Ask him. Ask him! Come on, bro. You don't care about us, really. You care about money. This man was telling kids that you gotta pay a mandatory fee to attend this school. The cost was approximately 12,000. Yeah, to this day, I'm still receiving an invoice from Bishop Sycamore, and it's from Education Resource. Kids and their parents called and told Coach Roy that we don't have the money for this. And Coach Roy literally said, "I can help you with that. Take out a loan." Roy pressured the kids into doing PPP loans, and it made it seem that the money was gonna go towards tuition. So now they're thinking this is like a grant or something. And the whole time, it's just nothing but a loan. If you don't do this, how else are you gonna cover a 16,000-dollar tuition being an 18-year-old unemployed student athlete? They don't understand that, okay, you do this loan, this gonna go and hit your credit. They're just understanding that 50 people wanna get D1, 50 people wanna go play football. But 50 people also got told, "Well, this is the only way that can happen." The first day, the parents were gone. It was just us and the coaches. We had to sign a paper with our information. We signed our names, gave our address and we signed our Social. After I signed it, I immediately called my dad just to get his take on it and to see what he had to say, and he was kind of upset with me. And what he told me was to just immediately get them, get the paper and discard it, or have them discard it. What did they say? - They said that, uh, they said that they discarded it, got rid of it. Have you given other people - your Social Security number? - No. Did you take out two PPP loans for 20,833 dollars? No, I don't... I didn't... I don't know anything about that. I ain't taken out no loans. I didn't get any PPP loans. We didn't get any PB loans. The school didn't get 100,000 dollars, 500,000 dollars, and we just had it anywhere. That did not happen. I would not tell 40, 30, 20 kids to all take out PPP loans from the United States government. I don't even trust the United States government. They were just on my ass. With Coach Roy, he's smart. He... He'll play you so dumb to your face to the point where you will think he's dumbfounded to the situation. But don't do it because he's smart. Like, he's smart. Real smart. He'll play you. Legally, I did not commit any fraud. I just hang out in the gray. What do they call me? Loophole Leroy? - ♪ (LOW MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ So one morning, the sun barely coming up. There's five geese on the road. This man goes full speed... and ran the geese over with no remorse. Did you ever run over a gaggle of geese? - Yeah. Oh, you did? Mm-hm. Yes, it was a geese. But I guess, because there were multiple there, that would be considered running over multiple geese, yes. This man says, "I gotta show you niggas what it's like to go to war. It ain't nothing like the smell of fresh blood in the morning." What happened is, it was by accident. But then after I ran it over, then I had to make a joke about it. And he reverses full speed.

Imagine what you're capable of. ♪ (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Early on in the season, we came out for practice one morning... and then there's a homeless man like trying to get into Roy's car. So when I walk out the front of the building, my car door is open and somebody's in it, like, you know, looking for something, whatever. This person looks up. And when I look up, it's not a player. It's just some guy. So I was like, "Yo!" This guy had my cell phone, my wallet, my stuff. So he turns around and I was like, "Bruh, you don't want this." 'Cause at this point, now a bunch of players were in it. I told the team the reason he's acting like this... is because he never had a dad whoop his ass. And then he took his belt off. He literally whipped him with the belt. The homeless dude with the belt. - I just started smacking him on his butt until he gave me my stuff. And I think he by accident, 'cause he maybe turned, got hit, like, you know, on the arm and the face, but... That went on for like a little, probably five minutes, and then everybody on the team just got licks in. The homeless guy, after the fight, he walked away with his, like, holding his ribs. Like, he didn't have his bike anymore 'cause they broke his bike. And the police show up, and they're like, "What happened, what's going on?" And he's laying there and he's like... "I knew I shouldn't have broke in his car and took his stuff. But they shouldn't... They shouldn't have done me like that. There was like a hundred of them. A hundred of them!" And I was... I was just like... I would never get involved in anything like that. So I was kinda like standing there as a bystander. I'm like, "This is not where I wanna be at all." And I was like... I was just shook. My son called me, and he said, "Mom, I wanna come home." He was really adamant, like, "I wanna come home." So when they were taking him in, 'cause he said he had to go to the hospital, he was like, "Am I gonna get pain meds for this?" All my kids are in college, but I got one kid staying at home 'cause he doesn't trust men, he can't play football, he can't do anything 'cause you fucked him up. You royally fucked my kid up. - ♪ (MUSIC FADES) ♪ There's a lot of anger in me. Insecurity, fear, and hurt comes out as anger. I don't want people to see me upset or I don't want people to know that I'm scared, so you come out with anger. And it's not really the anger that gets me in trouble. It's the aggression that comes out of it. That "fold 'em" side of me never comes out. And what I mean by a "fold 'em" side, you've gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run. Fold 'em, walk away, run, not in my DNA. Good morning, Mr. Johnson. You are charged with domestic violence, which alleges that you did knowingly cause physical harm to a family or household member. So, one of the... the... The things we didn't talk about the last time you were here that we feel like we have to address is the domestic abuse warrant that you had out for your arrest during the IMG game. - Mm-hmm. - ♪ (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Can you explain that situation to us? I had a charge with domestic violence. I was supposed to go to therapy for it. I went to therapy, I didn't complete the therapy, and there was a warrant issued. These are serious allegations, obviously. The victim did suffer visible injuries from this incident. She had a busted lip and there was blood on her chin when officers arrived. Did you ever hit her? - No. I lived with Coach Roy for about four months. I saw him on a weekly basis get violent with his girlfriend. And on a daily, he got verbally abusive with her. On a daily. Why would people say you were physically abusive if you weren't? I don't know. So, in my head, when you say physically abusive, I never smacked her, I never grabbed her by the head, threw her against the wall, never any of that. So... Especially in front of the players. I wanna say my second week there, I hear him and Miss Ashley arguing. I just so happened to look up. He slaps Miss Ashley, "You stupid bitch! Look... Look what you made me do in front of my players." - We get in the car... And he's laughing about it, like, "Yeah, man. Look what I had to do to her. Look what she made me do." The victim has also indicated that she ended up in the hospital last week due to the defendant's actions, although he took her to the hospital and told her to tell them that she, I think, fell off a ladder. How would I have responded if my daughter came home and said that situation happened, right? 'Cause that's really what it boils down to. I'd have whooped his ass. Would I send my kids to a school if I knew the principal had a domestic violence charge? No. Simple as that. So, you know, there are some titles in society that confer authority upon you. Once you're a doctor, you're not Mr. or Mrs. Or Miss anymore, you're Dr. That's the title that we refer to you by always. And "Coach" is that same way. Like that, in this society, is seen as somebody who is a leader of men and someone who is supposed to guide young men and make them better and teach them all of these values. And that's what all these kids were told. And then they ultimately see Coach beating up his girlfriend in front of them. They ultimately find out that Coach is a con man. I saw an opportunity that I thought could change my life, and once I really, you know, figured out that they couldn't help me and they're wasting my time, that kind of... That hurt me, like, in a dramatic way. I was feeling sick. Um, feeling very sick when it fell apart. Feeling hurt. Um, asking why. Well, I told my mom, "I don't even wanna be here no more." You know, I was losing everything. I know what hurt is. I know what depression is. I was lost, you know? What's my next move? When Trilian wanted to kill himself, I was just thinking about how many other kids are out there feeling the same way. How do I tell my momma that like, "Mom, I'm at a school where a coach wants me to do the same illegal stuff that you tried to get me away from"? It was over for me with football and just school in general. I just... After I left, I was... I was pretty much just done, like, with everything. That took me to a... very dark place. If I didn't go to Bishop Sycamore... I'd be showing my ass at college right now... ballin', as we're speaking. I'll still be having some pain in my lower back, so I just deal with it. I feel like they left me with a permanent injury. I do regret going to Bishop Sycamore. I do. I tried to take this opportunity as far as I can go. And this has really just broken me all the way down. All the way. I need a second, I'm crying and shit. Shit hard. I swear I never cried in my life. I'll call my mom right now. Fuck. I tried to make a better life for my family. I can't do it now. How can you do that to kids? Take them from their parents and destroy their dream. How can you do that? How? Coach Roy is evil. This man told me, all I gotta do is play football... to obtain my dream. The whole time, he tellin' me that just so he could benefit off of it. That's evil. How do you respond to that? Can we take a break? Please. Sure. - That's some fucking bullshit. These motherfuckers, man. Bruh, Pahokee? How many tourneys we paid for you? Oklahoma just literally hit us up, man, about him. And I said... I said, Pahokee... See, here's what I don't like. What I don't like, in trying to develop this, is that everything is cool. I get where you're coming from. But, dawg, y'all had problems with doing us this stuff, and we'd clean it up for you, we take it up for you. When you talk about Pahokee... I can't even explain to you the things that we did for Pahokee. Man, ain't nobody recovering from that. I'm telling you why they're not gonna recover from that. 'Cause it's not about recovering. It's about recovering because I gotta do that for my son and my family, because... Bruh, I don't need to recover from something I didn't do. Regardless of whatever people say, you always desire to be liked. You always desire to... The same way you feel about somebody, they feel about you the same way. And I think that's part of the struggle, is... those kids know that I would do anything for them. So now that you fucked up and you coming here, you need the opportunity, you get it. Yeah, the ESPN shit messed up so that's why you didn't get it. All right, Pahokee, I get it. But you, Pahokee, he only care about himself? If I only cared about myself, why'd I spend all that money on clothes and food and flying them all over the place, sending them to camps, all this, paying for attorneys and all that, if I only care about myself? What's my benefit from that? - And then I... - And you got screwed on in IMG. And... And... Regardless of whatever happens, you know, we still would do whatever we can. Zyshaun... Zyshaun knows. Like we're still trying to get Zyshaun - in a school somewhere. - Bruh, it is not... There's no way to win it. Roy, what did you do wrong? What would you change? I should've sent y'all home. I was dumb. I was egotistical. I thought I could actually do it. I got too emotionally wrapped up. I thought I could pull it. And I did and I didn't. Because I did that, I dragged you into something. I should've sent you home. The minute the church said it was over with, I should've walked away. That's what I should've done. Should've shut it down. ♪ (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ I don't think that he could have possibly let them down any more had he been in their lives in any other capacity short of being their fathers. Because the coach is seen as another father. And that's what he exploited. He exploited the goodwill that comes from the expectation that this is a person who's here to make young men better. But that's not what they got. They got him, right? They got his pursuit of profit. They got his pursuit of glory. How do you justify doing it for the kids when almost every kid we talked to said it just broke him? So, there's that part of me that wants to go, "You entitled, selfish, lying-ass niggas!" I saved you a year. Guess why you were coming there? Because you didn't have a college to go to anyway. That's why you came. So because you had nowhere to go, you came. And you came to get that extra year. It served its purpose. It gave you a chance to do that. How did I dash your dream? How did I keep you from going anywhere? You still went to college. ♪ (HOPEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ From the time Bishop Sycamore ended, I flew back to Texas. And then as I was in Texas, I was just training every day and seeing my family, being around friends. But just training, make sure I was always on top. I was thinking, anything could happen, so just train, keep training, never settle. So one of my trainers I was training with, he got me in contact with Grambling State. Grambling State is known for being an all-Black college, um, but also the coaches there... You have Hue Jackson that coached in the NFL. Hue Jackson is the former head coach of the Oakland Raiders and the Cleveland Browns and has a great reputation in the NFL for working with quarterbacks. He is one of those guys. You want your quarterback to get better? You call Hue Jackson. So for Trilian, perfect person for him to play for. Hue, you know, loved him. He said he loves your size. He loves your ability. He loves the way that you think as a quarterback. So, Trilian got the phone call. And I was in a whole other room and all I hear him doing is screaming. Hey, no. On God. I'm committing! What? What? What? Then he was like, "I got the offer. I got the offer." I was like, "What offer?" He's like, "To Grambling State." I'm like, "You're freaking kidding me." I'm committed now, dude. What you mean? I want him to go to a HBCU. Hey, I'm... Oh, I'm committed now! I felt that I'm living my dream, you know? Like even though I'm not there yet, I'm living my dreams. I was very excited. And so that's why I got these tears coming out 'cause, you know, I knew I have... I can make it at a HBCU. ♪ ("ME OR SUM" BY NARDO WICK PLAYS) ♪ ♪ Now she think she me or sum ♪ Let's ride, let's get it and let's go, you know? So... I cried. It's gonna make me cry now...

So... ♪ (HOPEFUL MUSIC STOPS) ♪ As soon as they found out about, you know, Bishop Sycamore, everything went left. ♪ (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ And as soon as I thought that I was actually happy, I found out my Grambling offer got taken away because I went to Bishop Sycamore. He basically said, you know, that we are not gonna be able to enroll you into Grambling because it wasn't even a real school. We're talking about Grambling and now we're talking about a player who spent a year at a school that did not exist. They don't have the manpower and the money to do everything that would have been necessary in order to get that young man in school. And that's the tragic irony of it all. It might have been the perfect place for him, but probably doesn't have the access to the resources necessary to help somebody who needed what he needed to get past the NCAA. So, of course, we're devastated. Start crying. Trilian's like... He wanna give up. I broke down. Broke down. I went to the room. I broke down crying. I'm supposed to be living my dream. You know, I was supposed to be the one to show the little homies that whatever you go through, you can make it. You feel me? You can go D1. To Roy, it's basically a fuck you. You feel me? And I'm gonna say it on camera. It's a fuck you. I think race plays an important role in this story. The fact that the players are Black is the reason why somebody like Roy Johnson would think that he could get away with this. I don't view this in the way a lot of other people do and say, "Man, how could you do this to your people?" He did that to his people because that's who you can do this to. Black players are the commodity in athletics. They are the prize that everybody wants and they are also the least respected people in the whole process. So, yeah, he was going to do this to Black people. An update tonight on the Bishop Sycamore High School controversy. So, in spite of what had been happening at Bishop Sycamore and just who they were, it took the ESPN game for the state of Ohio to care at all. Now Governor DeWine is calling for an investigation into Bishop Sycamore. The state of Ohio was embarrassed by this because this happened on their watch. And so the governor, Mike DeWine, has an investigation into this one school. What I hope comes out of the investigation is the truth. Uh, there's a story here and it doesn't sound like a very pretty story. They produce a 79-page document that says Bishop Sycamore is a scam and that it's not a real school at all. They call the thing explicitly a scam, and then said they couldn't do a damn thing about it. As it turns out, there's no law saying you can't run a fake school. This report doesn't do anything to prevent them from playing football in the future. It doesn't make anything they have done illegal. It doesn't send anyone to jail or accuse anyone of any crimes. It basically just scolds them for 79 pages. How is it that not one person was like, "Hey, we need to put a law in here to say that you can't make up a school." And the answer is very simple. Nobody thought anybody would make up a school. Who would do such a thing? All they could do was shrug their shoulders and be like, "Man, that's fucked up." So what's the difference between a school like IMG Academy and a school like Bishop Sycamore? Ultimately, they all have the same purpose, which is to be a place that high school football players go to play football, and if they go to school in the meantime, that's fine. Bishop Sycamore just skipped the part where they make the kids go to class or do their work. There are a lot of schools in the nation that put football first. Some of them do it a bit more reputably. Some of them are legitimately providing an opportunity for kids who otherwise wouldn't have it. So what you wind up with is a school that has very good teachers and everything else, but that is there to supplement the athletic programs rather than the athletic programs being a supplement to the school. Bishop Sycamore is just the most extreme example of that, where the academics was a lie. Football transcends sports. Football is the reason that I'm here. I'm not here for education. It's not about education. It's about football. Especially in Ohio. They did an 80-page investigative report. Seventy percent of it was talking about football. There you go, Mando. Oh, yeah! Look at him work. There you go, Mando. Almost there. Good work. And fortunately for me, unfortunately for a lot of students, there'll be more kids next year that need an opportunity to take an online class to get their grades up and to play football. So there's gonna be another Bishop Sycamore. There's other people that have started charter schools. But the reality of it is this. Is that the reason why I'm sitting in this chair is because we played the number one team in the country on national TV. That opportunity wasn't provided to us because I'm so smart. That opportunity was provided to us because the system sucks. And it's like, people looking like, "Oh, I can't believe this, it's not fair, they're cheating." No, I'm not, I'm just following the rules. You wrote the rules. I don't have the power to write the rules. Bishop Sycamore is just a name. The concept is not going anywhere. Our frustration needs to be directed towards something larger, because it's really easy to pick out the Roy Johnsons of the world and then say, "Hey, you are the problem." But he's not the problem. He is definitely more of a symptom. And we need to take a real, honest accounting of whether people should be making this much money off of kids. If we're gonna get to the point where we, as a state or a country, can actually punish people who do something like what Bishop Sycamore did, that means we have to reckon with what's going on at these other schools. But as long as the money machine is churning, like, no one really is interested in any of that. A lot of people in a lot of institutions can now see the benefit of having schools, because if they set up a school and they set up a strong athletic program, there's a good chance that they can get money. Which is why you have so many prep schools, right? No one can deny that there's prep schools out there that are taking financial aid and doing all types of things like that, because it's the wild, wild west. This whole game has been built around not paying players. Therefore the money goes to various adults who are able to "provide" the players in some way. Once you demonstrate you're somebody that has access to players consistently, now you got money from people who just want to stay in your good graces. But then there's also money that comes in from sponsorships. You might even be able to do endorsements around town. Now, you're a pillar of the community because you have built this football program that does these things for these kids. Bishop Sycamore does not happen if there wasn't an abundance of money in high school sports. If there wasn't this tie-in between athletics and education. And it was just sort of the naivety of the world to think that there wouldn't be someone as, um, exploitative as Roy, who would come in and do that to the extremes. What was in it for you? Making the insecurity feel better. There's a lot that goes into why I was doing it. You know what I mean? So now if I'm saying it makes me feel better, "Why does it make you feel better to help kids?" Because I wanna help. Well, why do you wanna help? 'Cause it makes me feel good. Why do you wanna feel good? 'Cause I'm insecure. - ♪ (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ I don't know what the point of it was 'cause you're putting yourself out there and you're a criminal now. Like, what was... what was the point of it? I really don't know. Saying that there is one reason for Roy to do this or one motivating factor is oversimplifying it. Roy saw the kids as a means to an end. What that end was is speculation. It was perhaps profit. If this is a scam and he's just trying to make some money, either in the short term or in the long term. Or it could have just been maybe notoriety and fame. It was an opportunity for him to have an image of himself, you know, locally in Columbus, but also what he thought would be a nationwide thing. And that is a powerful pull in this society, is I want people to know who I am. Whether it be fame or infamy, I want people to know who I am. But I don't think there's value in infamy when your infamy comes from exploiting kids. ♪ (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ We get our ass kicked. They plaster me all over there. Call me all types of names.
