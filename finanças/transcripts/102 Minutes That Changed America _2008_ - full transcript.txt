Yeah, Dispatcher?" Yes. - This is off-duty firefighter, Jumain I guess you got this already. You got a plane that crashed into the World Trade Center. Are you aware of that? You've got a plane that crashed into the World Trade Center in Manhattan? - World Trade Center in Manhattan. - Oh, my God! No way. Holy mofo, what is that though? Mom, it's like a huge, just like explosion or something. Yeah, yeah. Did you hear what I said about it like maybe not being a bomb? 'Cause like it's up high, mom. It's unbelievable, it woke us up. We're frickin' videotaping it. Yeah, yeah. I just have no clue what it is, there's just black smoke, and what looks like paper, but... Unbelievable. - You should just tell her to watch the news dude, it's all over there. - It's on the news. - Just a few moments ago, something believed to be a plane crashed into the tower of the World Trade Center. I just saw flames inside, you can see the smoke coming out of the tower. We have no idea what it was. It was a tremendous boom just a few moments ago. You can hear around the emergency vehicles heading towards the scene. Now this could have been an aircraft, or it could have been something internal. It appears to be something coming from the outside, due to the nature of the opening, on about the 100th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. - The World Trade Center, tower number one is on fire. The whole outside of the building, there was just a huge explosion. - This is confirmed, this is confirmed. - Oh my God, dude. What is up with that? That is ed up. - That's the building? - Yeah. - Holy mackerel! - Every available engine that you got to this position. - Rescue crews responding. - Jesus Christ. - Do we have any report on a fire condition yet from on-scene personnel? - Reports uh, numerous floor's on fire. - Is this the second alarm right now? - This is the third alarm since we've been transmitting. - Four David, 10-4. - Oh, man. Are you there? I just saw the hugest explosion. Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah, yeah, we're plenty far away. Apparently a plane went right through it. There's gotta be hundreds of people dead. - Oh God. - We have breaking news this hour out of downtown Manhattan. A plane has allegedly crashed into the World Trade Center. Details at this hour, very sketchy. Just a few moments ago, allegedly a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. We don't have any reports of what type of plane, what perhaps the carrier was, how many injuries are there right now. Police and fire units are being dispatched to the scene as we speak. Again, these are only sketchy details, we'll just stay with pictures. You're looking at live pictures right now from News Chopper 7. - Mike check, news copter, 1, 2, 3. Mike check from the news copter. Yeah I can hear that. Alright, I'm standing by. - Oh, my God. Oh, man, what? - Oh my goodness. Look at that. I don't know, wow. - Oh my God. - Imagine that a airplane hit it. - Hit the building? Wow. - You can see it from the Lincoln Tunnel and everything where we were pulling into the Lincoln Tunnel, and everybody stood up on the bus. Huh? I don't know, I can't see. Chris tell me they've locked all the doors, and everything's flying all over the place, there's people everywhere. I don't know. It hit the building, everything just went rignt up into smoke. - No, that's the World Trade Center. - What just hit? - The Twin Towers, the buildings that they-- Yeah, all the way downtown, where it almost got blown up that time. - Uh oh. - Oh, my God. Feel sorry for whatever amount of people was up on that floor, you know? - Yeah, I know, destroyed. - And we're trying to gather some information as to what type of plane this might have been into this area. I can tell you as we are looking here at the north side of the north-facing tower number one, the gash that is in the building, runs from about 10 stories up, to about 15 stories going from right to left. And now we have quite a bit of smoke and flame pouring out of the eastern side of tower number one, and at this point, Jeff, that is all we have. We are still looking at smoke billowing out of tower number one. - Um, well I was walking down Chamber Street, and fully saw the entire event. With my own eyes, I saw the entire, I saw the plane, from the sky pass right into it. Amazing. - Yeah, well, that's what it looks like. Hey, I can see what appears to be a hole, but there's so much smoke, you know, from where I'm looking at it. Oh, you can hear the sirens now, right? I'm telling you, the whole tower is on fire. Yeah, 'cause there's black smoke coming out of the one side. I hope it wasn't a terrorist attack. 'Cause that means tunnels are next, bridges are next, you know. This is not good. Not good at all. - Oh, my God. - Straight into the building. - Can you imagine the people who work in there? They must be going crazy right now. - Did you find apartment 328? - This is operator 2-7-6-4, we have 100 people trapped on the 105th floor of the one World Trade Center. - Okay. - Want to know if they should evacuate. - Really, they should remain where they are, if they can put something to block the smoke from coming in under the door. 'Cause we're in the building, and the hallways are filled with smoke, so they should not go in the hallways. - Okay. - Alright? - They've already started trying breaking the windows, they're panicking on that floor. - I understand ma'am. Listen, we're doing the best that we can, okay? - Alright. - Thank you. - in' awful. - Cell phones don't even work. Hey, go over one more block down this way. Everybody's running away. - Look! Somebody's falling, somebody's falling! - You can't stay here. I'm sorry, you got to go. Go, you got to clear, let's go! - That, what is that falling? Oh, my God, don't be a person. - Where? - Oh, my God. - Where? That right there? - What are those big heavy things falling at a rate that a piece of paper would not fall. - Oh, my God! - No way. Like that, Katelyn, you see that? Do you see the-- - Yeah, I see it. I see it, I just, I mean, who's to say it's not like a chair? That's a big chair, that's a big chair. - Regardless, it's gonna be so dangerous at that pace, obviously. Wait... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - What? - Oh, my God! It's terrorists that-- - What do I do? - Mom, another plane just crashed into the other World Trade Center. I don't know a plane like hit it. A jet, a jumbo jet. I'm so scared, I'm leaving. - No! Don't! - Bye, I love you! - Megan... Wait for me! - Take the camera, get your cell phone. Oh, my God! Get the outta here! - Do we take the elevator? - I don't want to be on the 32nd floor of this building anymore. - Holy shit. - Oh, shit! - How many planes crashed into it? - Two, another one. - And then I saw the one hit the middle of it, and we're like, get the outta here. - I would say for me being back here feels surreal. - And I never left, but I'm never down here just sort of considering that day. - Yeah, that's interesting, 'cause for me, every time I come here, it's specifically like, oh, remember college. Remember the worst day of your life. - Yeah. This is the elevator we jumped in. I remember, I think it was this one, right? - Yeah, I remember when 102 Minutes, when you guys originally asked for our footage, I thought why do they want this, why do they want to interview us, and then now, 15 years later, after having watched it, I realized, oh, this is why they wanted it. We were children. You know, we had this very unique perspective where we're old enough to understand what's going on almost instantly, kind of young enough to not know what's going on with my point of view, and mature enough to be able to sort of narrate it without realizing we were narrating it. - And our friend Phil was either with us or in the elevator. - Yeah, people have emailed me or Facebook messaged me, and said hey, I was in that elevator on that TV show. - We both get messages on Facebook and Twitter on 9/11 from people who've seen the footage, and it somehow, our experience in particular resonates with them. - But the thing is, it's a universal reaction, which is empathy. People see it and they just feel so, they just want to, they always say, I just want to hug you. - Those first five years were hard. And we saw things nobody should have to see. I remember seeing people standing in those windows, and we were close enough that we could see them holding hands, ready to jump. I couldn't talk about it with anyone, and I also felt like my perspective was rather insignificant, knowing that those people were lined up in windows and their only option was to jump to their death. What did it matter that I saw that, and that I was feeling terrible about what I was feeling inside. It just didn't seem justified when so many people died, and so many people lost their husbands and wives, and sons and daughters that I was allowed to feel what I was feeling. I think the worst minute personally of that day for me, was hearing Caroline say, "Don't leave me!" I wasn't leaving you. - It sure looked like it. - I was making you move faster. - Still besties. - Still best friends, right? I get that question a lot from people who have seen the documentaries. - Yeah, even though she tried to ditch me that day. - She's the only person in this world who knows exactly what I experienced that day, and can probably anticipate any anxiety that we could possibly have before anyone else in our lives around. It's nice knowing there's at least one other person out there that knows what I went through that day. - Apparently that was another plane, we have witnesses, that was the second plane that just blew. - It's been another one, Carl. - Yes, he hit in building number one. - The other building. - Yes, he flew right into it. Southeast corner. - You're seeing, it looks like, some kind of sick confetti parade. There is debris flying out of that south tower. - Brian! - Get outta here! - Brian , Brian! Go! Go! Oh, my God! - Get out! Now! Shut up! - Definitely something hit the second tower. Two-thirds of the way up, we've got visible fire showing out there. Suggest to the incident commander, Fort David, to transmit a fifth alarm to tower two. - An airplane hit the second tower, okay? - That plane was a large, bomber-style, green aircraft into the second tower, be advised. - 10-4. - Holy! ing hell! That's terrorists. I can't believe I just saw that. Both Trade Towers. Good God. - Another plane just hit! - Nah, another building! - In the other building. - Oh, shit! - Oh, you see it on television. Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of deaths. - Whoa, the whole building, it's on fire! - No, both of 'em. - So, both of 'em are on fire now, huh? - What's going on, man? - I don't know, man. - Well, what just hit it? - An airplane? - Another one? Wait, was the first one an airplane? - No, what was that? That was a, just now. - As far as I could tell, that was a United, it looked like, I swear it looked like a United airplane that crashed into the side of it. - The one that just came in now? - Yes! - Jesus Christ. - Mom, the other tower just blew up. Oh, my God! - How did that happen? - Oh, my God, I'm shaking! The World Trade Center on the left side. - No, it's not coming down. - Come on. Look at the window, out the window. I'm shaking. - A second explosion has just happened, the first we understand was from an airplane, the second we have no idea. - No idea at all at this point what has triggered it. If we take maybe a wider shot. - Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. - Look it's on fire! How do you get to that, you know? - I don't understand how they're gonna help these people. - First they have to get the people out then they have to fight the fire. How do they do that? - I can't believe we're almost there right now. I just can't believe it. - Fire 3-2-8, what's the address? If you feel that's necessary, sir, I can not... Yeah, I'm not there, I can not advise you. If you feel that is necess... Okay, have him cover the doorway. Have you stuffed the doorway with, did you put something in the doorway to block the smoke? I'm 3-2-8, but we have personnel there, we're on the way. If you feel you must, I can not direct you on that. 3-2-8. - Dispatcher 4-1-4, what is the address? 88th floor, what building? Building two? You seen any firemen as of yet? They're there, but... Just hold on. So it's Two World Trade, 88th floor in the northwest corner? - My is coming up the floor of 89. - Alright, stay with me for a minute. Sir, are on the 89th, or 88th? 88th, I don't... Alright, we're in the building, and we're gonna convey the information to the emergency guys. - God damn! - Stand by, one second. Yeah, we copy. Once again, we're live over the west side of Manhattan. We're up around 79th street, about five miles north of the World Trade Center, and again to recap the events here this morning as we are assembling them, is that at approximately 8:45 this morning, an airplane traveling from north to south struck the north tower here of the World Trade Center. Shorty after that, as the first building was engulfed in flames, we were on our way to the scene and we witnessed a second airplane strike the south side of the second tower, the south tower, and that is the second row of flames that you see here. As far as air traffic in the New York Metropolitan Area, all operations at the New York airports, being Newark, John F. Kennedy International, and LaGuardia Airport all air traffic operations has been suspended. As far as other aircraft traffic right now, us included, we are being kept at a distance of five miles from the site of this absolute disaster. - Jesus Christ, you know, if that's happening, we got to get the hell out of here. Sorry. - Yeah, what happened? - Half my company is in both those towers on floors that got hit. I can't get through. I was there only six months ago, my office is now in Midtown. - What company? - Marsh McLennon, Marsh, Inc., Mercer Consultant Group, and William M. Mercer, Putnam and Guy Carpenter, occupy all floors in that range there that looks like that got hit. - I'm devastated. I can't imagine this happening to my, I just have some very dear old friends in the World Trade Center. I hope they're okay. - What else do you want to take in, defribulator?? - Do you need that? - Let's go! - I got my car parked down there. I know, so do I. Don't worry about it, come on. We're moving out, come on. We're just moving back the area. We got to get a safe time in 'em. Let's go. - Everybody please step back! Let's go! Get ahold of Field Comm, we need them on West and Vesey Street gang. field com, West and Vesey. - Let's go, get the out of here. - Jerry! - in' A! Get the out of here. - God! Oh, my God! That was ed up! - Ma'am the police want everybody off the roof. Hurry up! - Everybody out the building, everybody evacuate the building. - This is a terrorist. - Do you think? - I think so. - Oh, yeah. - For two planes, one right af-- - There were two? - Another one just hit it. - Yeah, two. - I did not know that! - Just another aircraft hit it. - You coming up in the elevator? - I'm coming down, I'm coming down! - This is serious, serious stuff. They're evacuating the whole building? - You bet, it's better, because our building's really high. We don't know what's gonna happen. - A second plane hit? - A second plane hit. - That's incred... That's on purpose, then. - That's definitely on purpose. - It was a British Airways. - Was it? It was a British Airways? - It was a commercial airliner. - Yeah, I saw that one, but a second one hit, too. - Someone said it was the British Airways hit the second World Trade right in the middle. - You're kidding! This is ing unbelievable. ing unbelievable. - Oh, my God, someone's jumping. Right there. - I know. - I don't think there's any way they can get out. - What can you do, exactly. I wonder if they both hit from the front. Do you know that, did they both hit from? - On the news, they said the second plane came around in a circle, linking back. - Yeah that second plane-- - Right, and hit from the other side. - It's like Pearl Harbor. - Yeah, yes. - Nobody expected it, early in the morning. - This is a strange new world. - I was watching it, I saw it smash right into it! God! Yeah, the people are dead. We don't have any idea how many people there must have been. - Well the second one kind of went-- - Do you think there were, there might have still be people in the building. - No, the second hit, man. - That was a different tower! - I do know that there were major efforts to have disaster drills, to have a preparedness plan in the event of an awful tragedy like this, but one has to wonder how with two gigantic skyscrapers-- - I can't even imagine. - How the fire department and can handle both in that confined space. - Shh! Dude, half the people down there have no idea what's happening. - Let's go, clear the area! - Two Planes? - Two Planes. - Would you believe this? I seen the first one, I saw the explosion, the first one, but I thought it was a bomb, but then they said no, it was a plane. All of a sudden the other get through the same thing. And now I hear somebody said the news, that they said they're gonna do it every half hour. - They're gonna fly a plane into this thing every half hour? - Yeah. - Isn't it done enough, I mean... - We were standing after the second one and then just went back to get film. - After the first one, we went all the way down there. We were on Church Street, and I said, "I want to get a different camera." And we walked back, the next one, we were right there. - We were not in a good place to be when that other plane. - I have news for you, I think everybody's like leaving from here. Everybody's leaving from here. - Oh, yeah. - I mean, this is ridiculous. Who knows what can happen? - Keep moving, let's go! - Hey, Jim? - Yes, Arnie? - They appear to be getting the water on those fires. If you can see the flames on the south tower, which appear to be getting lesser and lesser. It's where the smoke is getting progressively lighter and lighter, indicating that the fire officials are getting closer to putting this fire out. - It's not safe. It's not safe here! Do me a favor and move, okay? Alright. - Come in. - Go ahead. -OK Fieid comm, number one World Trade Center, the 103 floor, southwest corner and northwest corner. Reported to be 100 people overcome at that location. - Repeating, one World Trade Center, 103rd floor, north corner, reported to be 100 people in that location. Also, Ladder 3's reporting, On the 36th floor, going up on the stairwell, they've got numerous injuries, repeating numerous injuries from burns occupied in the stairwell at this time. Does field com receive? - field com receiving. - What happened? -Let's go, c'mon let's go! -That way, that way everyone that way! -This way! - First of all, we was just in the building, and we was looking out the window, 'cause we saw the paper going around, and we're looking out, all of a sudden, we seen a plane come from this direction. - Were you on the same floor? - Yeah, remember I told you. I told you, went right through this building right over here. Two blocks away, all right. - The second plane came from that side. Right into the side, boom. - Did you feel the first one? Were you in the first one? - No, no, we just looked out the window, we were in the building and we saw, we said what, did the Yankees win the World Series again? It was like a ticker tape parade, we were joking around, and then we looked out the window and realized that it was on fire. We didn't hear it whatsoever. Then we came down to check it out. - I saw it all. - I was in the 50th floor of the Millennium Hilton, and I was getting ready to call my wife. I heard the whine of a jet. It had the nose down, it was hauling ass. I looked up and I thought, what is this plane doing coming so fast, and it just slammed right into the tower. - Nuh uh, you're kidding. You're kidding me. - It just went down. - What? Holy mother of God. - And they were hijacked? - Apparently, well that's what the neighbors were just saying, that apparently they were hijacked, but the FBI got word that these two planes were hijacked. And then suddenly they have one crashing into the building and then next one crashing in, about 20 minutes later. - Hell yeah! It was crazy, man! - I heard the first plane was a Cessna. - What if it got hijacked then? - The first one was a two-prop, the second one was a actual twin-engine huge plane. - It didn't look that big when it hit. - No, it was huge. - You can see the glass shattering right now, little-by-little. - That was horrible. - I couldn't get it, it was like a big, regular jet. - I'm not gonna be able to get through. - Keep trying, try mine. - No, I'm calling the AmEx building. - Stunned, to say the least. - At 110 stories, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center dominate the New York City skyline. 50,000 people work in these buildings, travelling here from all over the metropolitan area. More than 700 firms and organizations from over 60 nations have offices at the center. The World Trade Center is home to some of the largest and some of the smallest international businesses operating today. It is having a major impact on the economic life of New York and many nations around the world. - Whoa, look at that damage. What's going on? - It's a plane, a plane crashed. Holy shit, it hit both towers. Unbelievable. - Once again, ladies and gentlemen, due to a plane crash at the World Trade Center, until further notice, there are service changes and there will probably be service changes all service to Brighton Beach is suspended, all W trains operate to 36th Street only. - I can only imagine what's going on on the ground over there. - People have been crying in the streets. There are no phone services down here. People can not use their cell phones, they can't use their walkie talkies, but right now we have people crouching behind cars, police trying desperately to move the crowd back, they've moved the crowd back quickly, about four or five blocks. And from what we see, we are seeing big chunks of the building fall to the ground. That there is truly a scene of chaos here on the ground, and folks are looking in the air afraid for another impact. - Were you here working? - I was here earlier with the United States Marshalls. - And did you hear anything? - I heard two explosions. - What'd you see? - A lot of fire, just what you're seeing right now. - Can you say anything to comfort those who are concerned about loved ones inside? - Let me find them first, okay? Keep safe, alright? - Jesus Christ. - All civilians... - We need volunteers in first aid! - Oh, shit! - Go slowly. - Vinnie! Vinnie, you got Stu with you? Where's Stu? Find him down here. Just find him, see if you can find him, 'cause I want to know where he is, though. - Come in. - Go ahead. - Attention all units, by the order of city-wide call commander, all off-duty firefighters and all off-duty officers are hereby recalled, repeat, by the orders of the city-wide call commander, all off-duty firefighters and all off-duty officers are hereby ordered to recall immediately. - Now speaking about the situation here in New York City at the World Trade Center. We're trying to bring you his comments live as best we can quickly here. - To hunt down and to find tho folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand, and now if you join me in a moment of silence. - President Bush speaking from an elementary school in Florida. - May God bless the victims, their families, and America. Thank you very much. - Brief comments in which apparently we didn't catch the beginning of it, but he was talking about this being a terrorist attack, and talks about getting the folks responsible. About the folks inside the World Trade Center, 45 minutes after the first plane crash into the building, we have yet to hear word one. - The fire dispatcher 449 the address to the fire? - Listen to me, listen to me, you said you were at two world trade? And you're on the 105th floor? Any particular corner or room? I understand. The fire department is on scene, that's what I can give you at this time. I'll relay the information to the units. Understand that, sir. Sir, I understand, I'm sorry. Thank you. - Fire department 3-2-8, what's the address? Okay, I can only tell you to try to remain calm, to remain low to the ground, the smoke rises. Keep your mouth covered if you can, alright? No, you can not. I can not update you on that. I can only ask you to remain calm and stay where you are, okay? I understand that, it is for hundreds of other people also, sir. We're doing the very best we can, okay? We're in the building, we're getting to you as soon as we can. - Fire 408. Okay, sir. Okay, just sit tight. That's up to you, just stay where you are. Sir, I'm not a fireman, I'm just telling these guys where to go, just stay where you are, if you gotta break a window, break a window. Only thing I can tell you to do is sit tight, alright, because I got almost every fireman in the city coming out to help you. Alright, they're coming, all I can tell you is sit tight until somebody leads you out of there. Just sit tight. I'm telling you, just stay where you are! Don't leave your floor, don't leave your office, stay where you are. I'm hanging up. - Yeah, how you doing? This is the command post in tower two of the World Trade Center. This is Chief Dedler, I gotta get a run-down of the companies, we're in a state of confusion. - Alright, for 8-0-8-7? - Is that the box number? - That's for 2 World Trade. - That's where we're at, number two, we're in the south tower. - Edna, Edna, pick up 2-6-3. Give this guy the run-down of the number two World Trade. - Hello? - Yes. - Okay, that's engine 211, ladder 11. Engine 44, engine 22. - Hold on, engine 44. - Engine 22, engine 53, engine 40, division three, battalion 10. Battalion 12, ladder 16, ladder 2, ladder 13, engine 221, engine 23, engine 209, engine 212, 279, 230, 229, 235, 220, 216, 217, 238, 214, ladder 12, ladder 118, ladder 7, ladder 24, high rise 1, battalion 11, engine 74, engine 76, engine 47, engine 58, engine 91, ladder 22, ladder 25, ladder 35, ladder 4, ladder 21, engine 41. - Right, that's good. Is there someway we can maintain this link open? - Alright, 10-4. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - It's safer here than on the street. Do not open the window! - Oh, my God! Oh, there's people hanging out the windows and shit, I see a person waving a flag. Oh, no, there's another guy up there hanging. Oh, my God. It's just probably so hot in there, they're just burning up, you know? Oh, he fell out! Oh, he fell out, the guy with the flag! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, these poor in' people. Oh, man! Oh, I just can't believe what I'm seeing. Look at all the people walking uptown, Jamie. Thousands of people just walking uptown away from this, horrible, horrible. - Everyone for your own safety, please move out of this area. - The smell is unbelievable. The smell of burning wire and metal. Unbelievable. - He has taken off from Florida, where he was speaking about a half an hour ago at an elementary school. He is aboard Air Force One. - No, no, I want to hear it. - You want to hear it? - They're going to keep him in the air at this point. The Capitol Building, the Treasury, and the White House have now all been evacuated. - A plane crashed into the Pentagon just a little while after the two planes crashed into the two towers of the World Trade Center here in New York. They have also evacuated the Capitol Building and let's listen in for Tom Kaminsky in chopper 880 who joins us again. - Tom, we have a question for you. Can you get out of Manhattan? - All of the Port Authority crossings are closed down as we've been saying. The subway service severely disrupted, no one really being allowed to move anywhere. At this point, if you are in a safe spot anywhere around this area, probably the best thing for you to do is to just stay exactly where you are until this situation gets rectified to some degree, because it has not been rectified to any degree yet. - Alright, Tom Kaminsky, we seem to be losing him at this point. We can tell you about evacuations. Manhattan is sealed off. If you want to get in, you cannot at this point in time. - It is Tuesday morning, the 11th of September, and you will not forget this date. - People, let's start walking to the east side. - ...the city hall park, and the situation down here is this, every building in lower Manhattan has virtually been just emptied, and people are now clogging the streets. There's panic at times, people run when they think debris is falling, there's fear that more might come down. Police are trying to push people north. If you're in the streets, walk slowly north. -Come on, let's go! - Shit. - Oh, wow. - People we need everybody to please get to a sidewalk, get out of the street. Keep going east or west of the area. Walk north, evacuate the area. All civilians continue walking north. - It's very dangerous. This is a terrorist attack. Let's go, they could be bombing other buildings up here. You don't wanna get killed right? - Come on, let's go! - People we need everybody to please get to a sidewalk, get out of the street, keep going east or west from the area. - Let's go people, you're supposed to be cooperating. - Gonna see if my guys are all right. - Hang in there. Yeah, let me just talk to ya. You good? Lighting's okay? - You're good. - Joe, right? - Joe. - Napolitano? - Napolitano. - You're breathing heavy. Where were you? Take me through it. - I just was in the lobby trying to get a cup of coffee, heard the bang, and I'm just going around the corner, see if my friend's all right. I can't talk. - Let's go, folks, come on. Move it up - Please move out of this area. - Watch out. - All right. I want you to move all of your people away from the building. - Everybody back up, everybody move. - Back, everybody back, keep moving, get back! I don't care. I don't care, get out. - What's your badge number? - Get out, don't worry about it. - Who is that guy? Get that guy out of here. - Where is he going? - PD's out here to stop the traffic. - You've got civilians walking back into the area here. - We need some PD down here! - Jesus Christ. - All of that putrid shit coming down. - Tell them to be aware of their surroundings. Don't leave the hose laying around. you gotta take em... - Another person fell out of the building, all units all units to use caution. - Shit. - The building is unstable. Let's move to the east side. - Let's go, let's go man, please. - Hey, Ray,. - Here, let me get one... - I use to go to the firehouse with my dad and ride along with them back in the day when I was you know, like the young kid. And I use to ride on the firetruck with them on runs and stuff. I guess it was just always in my blood from that. My dad's father was fireman also, so it's kinda in our blood. My sons say they wanna be firemen, so we'll see what happens. - Do you wanna be a fireman? Yeah? - Austin, Lisa, Cross, Wylie. - Oh, what are you gonna call yourself, Lisa? - Well, in my neighborhood, they still call me Cross, so really my name is Wylie. - Why can't each one just say what they wanna Okay. - Well, we got you a uniform. - Lisa Wiley, W-Y-L-I-E. - Joanne Doria Cross. - Laura Cross. - Brian Cross. - Denise Felman, D-E-N-I-S-E F-E-L-D-M-A-N. - When Brian was talking to him on the phone, it went static, and then he lost touch of him. It was terrible, just not knowing, and you know. - We've heard so many different stories of where he was found. Who found him? Where was he, what was he doing? What job was he doing? He was in the towers, he wasn't in the towers. - My wife, Lauri, always watched ah, any of the 9/11 shows, so that night, she happened to have been watching this 102 Minutes, and, actually, when I walked by, and just took a peek in, and looked, and I said, "Lauri that was just Dad.", and she was like, "No way." I said, "Yeah, rewind it.", and then I called or texted my whole family, and called my mother, and notified them of it, and then we all watched it at our-- - Watched it. - Yeah. - Yeah, watched it 30 times. - See, they're just doing their jobs there now. They don't realize that these buildings are gonna fall. - Within 10 minutes or less. - They don't realize it, oh my God. - I don't even think it was that. - They're just trying to figure out how to get the people out, you know? - There he is. - There he is. - Oh my God. Oh God, oh God. - It's nice to find something to put together all those puzzles to see exactly what was the right story. Where was he stationed working at the moment, at the time. For me, maybe to see like how far away was he from surviving? We did get that last glimpse to see like-- - We got that little last glimpse. - He wasn't nervous. He wasn't afraid. He wasn't worried. He was strong, working, ready. - Oh yeah, oh no. - He had the tank on. - In charge, so. - He wouldn't have been afraid, no. He was doing his job. - He was doing his job. - You ready? - If I take a picture, am I going to mess you up when I click? - We're gonna be like this for two hours? I don't believe it. - All right, shut the windows, shut the ACs. - Collapsed, there is panic on the streets, thousands of people running up Church Street which is what I'm looking out on, trying to get away. - As far as I can tell, the top half of the building, at least half of it, I did to know that that. Half of it just started this gigantic rumble. falling down on itself, it collapsed. - Oh shit. Oh shit. - Oh don't you. - Oh man. - Help me, help me, somebody. - Studio, are you on with me? This is Chopper Five. Studio, you copy? Studio, the Two World Trade just collapsed, copy? Yeah, go ahead, go ahead. There's a portable crew down by the World Trade Center. Those guys are, I don't know if they're all right or not. I didn't copy. I did not copy that. All right, are you hearing me? Studio, are you hearing me right now? Okay, yeah, anybody who can hear me the-- The studio wants you to shoot as much tape as possible, as much tape as possible, copy? - Help, help. - How you doing today? State police about 90 in a 65. So you live in Springfield? On Quick Silver Drive? You still live on Quick Silver Drive? - Yeah. - I'll be right with you. Okay, sir, 90 miles an hour in a 65 zone is $270 fine. - I don't see the building. Did the building just disappear? Are you sure? I don't see the other World Trade Tower. - It's just so much smoke from the first building. - It looks almost like a mushroom cloud exploded into this billowing, billowing smoke look at that. That is about as frightening a scene as you will ever see. - Can you go in the other room, please baby? Just go watch some TV. - ...the South Tower just apparently collapsed. - Honey, there is no second building. It's gone, it's gone. - Go, go. - Honey, stop it. - I don't know what to do. I can't get downstairs. I don't know what we should do. - Just, you're gonna sit right here, and we'll be fine. - Yes, Raphael? Hi, it's Kate in 25D. Oh, we're not evacuating, are we? They what? - World Trade Center Tower has collapsed. - We should evacuate? So is everybody downstairs? - What's happening? - The World Trade Center's blown up. We're just going to get some air. Keep your apartment door shut if you have clean air in there. Yeah? Oh , forget about it. - What? - Forget about this. - Oh. - It's just a cloud. - The roof of the building we can say is not where it was 10 minutes ago. Lower Manhattan was simply completely enveloped in smoke, visibility zero. - Debris, it looks like a nuclear war happened here. You can't see the sky at all. It's all grey. - Right now I'm on Broadway and Leonard Street. I'm in a crowd, and we are escaping an enormous cloud of dust and debris. - Ladies and gentlemen, there are times in our lives that are life-changing, where your life can never be the same, and this appears, certainly, to be one of them. - Where do we go? - We can't go in the street. We cannot go in the street. - What do we do? - Stay here until the dust... You cannot even breathe outside. - I don't know No, you cannot even - Any unit operating near Two World Trade Center, urgent. Any unit at Number Two World Trade Center. - This is the condition of my building. Firemen are coming in. -Oh God. - Got a cell phone? - Two, two. - What am I calling? I have a cell phone. - Hand it to me. - Cell phone - What am I calling? What am I calling? - You know what, Charlie, I'll come with you. - I'm going to Manhattan. - Okay, one. - Four, seven, four. - Two, one, two. - Four, seven. - Four, seven, four. Is this your wife's you're calling? Yeah, hello? Hold on one second, I have your husband here, okay? - Can you get an outside line? - Yeah. -'Cause I gotta call someone and tell them I'm OK. - Hello? Mom? I'm all right. - Just talk to her. Don't try to listen. -I'm alright. I'll call you back. - Oh my God. - Yeah. Hey, who else am I calling here? Who else are we calling here? You wanna call your family? As he said, everybody's dead. They're going back out. Do you wanna call your? Charlie, do you have another, Charlie, do you have another set of gloves do ya? Oh my God. - Studio, can you hear me? This is Kai can you here me? No I do not. We do have guys down there, and I talked to some of them. You know, I don't know. This is like a dream, man. Yeah, a nightmare. - Hello? I can't see a thing. It's possible. - If you're just joining us, we're hearing that the first plane was hijacked. - It's possible, it's possible. - Plane that hit the second tower of the World Trade Center. - They're showing video of it, it's gone. Oh my God, all those people down there. Jennie, Jennie, do you know how many people were in that building? There's like 30 to 40,000 people per building. - We're only looking at one. Yes, it's gone. Just disappeared. It's gone, Jennie, it's gone. It's completely gone. - Just looked around and saw just a buckling of the tower. - Oh my God. - And it just looked like it collapsed within itself. You could just see the top of the tower collapse. We can't tell what happened to the bottom half of the tower from here. - Have you seen any people being evacuated? I know that people are fleeing, but have you seen any of the injured being evacuated from the area? I know there are so many who are down there to help them. - We have not actually been able to get close enough to see actual distance at the scene because, obviously, at this point, it's still not secure. - Let's go, back it up. Make a hole, make a ing hole! Make a ing hole! Make a ing hole! - Get the cameras out of here. Let's go, get off now, go. Walk! Walk! Get back, let's go. - On the other side of the barrier. Go on, the other side of the barrier. The other side. On the other side, up there, up there. Everybody up there. - What happened? - The roof simply caved in. It collapsed. I need some water. - Give him some water. This guy right here. Give him some water. - Sit down, sit down. - Engine 221 I'm at the World Trade Center. We're at the scene of the collapse. - You all right? - Yeah. In, deep breath in, in, hold it, in hold it. Out, o, in. - Somebody has I need water, I need water. - It's salt water. - Right there you can get water and everything that you need. Right there. - Are you okay? - I don't know. - Are you hurt? - No. - No, that's nothing, nothing hurts. Why don't you sit down for two minutes? Try to calm down. - I think a head wound, but he's going to be okay. Take a minute. A minute's not gonna matter. - That man who saved our lives. What's your name? Liutenant McGinn, Tim McGinn. - Blew out the window with his pistol. We all would have died. - Water. - We're moving some people, be advised. We're moving some people to, we're setting up an ad-hoc ah an ad-hoc emergency post. We need EMS personnel we could use more people, cause the place is filling up with ashes. - You're not suppose to be going in there, bro, get out. -Pick up Mike. - I need to get up to 25th. - I'm the last one. - There's nobody up on 25th? - No, they evacuated everybody down. They probably all went down to the bus. - This side of the building come down? - I don't know. Something came down, I couldn't see. - It was pretty clear at one point, and then there's a whole bunch of smoke and glass, and I think we're just about the last ones in this building right now. I think you should leave. Everybody else is gone. -OK I'll just make sure that there's nobody else coming downstairs. - What do you think happened? - I hear the top of the building fell down. Fell over us. I don't know, I haven't seen outside yet. - The tower collapsed into the ground just about 10 minutes ago. Kelly's joining us live. Where are you now? You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm 7th Avenue South. I'm about 10, 15 blocks north. I'm looking at the North Tower, still heavy smoke coming out of it, but I can tell you that I'm looking at blue sky where I was looking at the South Tower of the World Trade Center. - I can tell you the reaction on the street there are people sobbing. There are people frantically trying to dial their cell phones. Many of them don't know that service has been cut off. Everybody is sharing what little information they have with each other, but I can tell you that people are very, very frightened. - All right, thank you, Kelly Edwards reporting live from downtown where so many thousands and thousands of people are waiting to hear the fate of the loved ones after the World Trade Center South Tower completely collapsed, the North in flames. Here's what we do know about the apparent hijackings of these jet liners that crashed into the buildings. One of the planes was hijacked out of Boston, according to FFA sources, and now we're learning that another source, speaking on a condition of anonymity says that second plane was flown out of Newark. - I think it's terrible. It's a tragedy. I think we should go to war now. - My personal opinion is we should go to Bin Laden, all those Arabic countries and just blow them up, kill them. That's it, honestly, kill them. - World Trade Center blew up. - How's it make you feel? - How's it make me feel? It makes me feel wonderful. The ing World Trade Center just blew up. Dude it, dude, take this camera out of my face. - These animals, they don't deserve to live on this earth. They should eliminate them. - And we should-- - Pulverize them, the mothers. - And we should retaliate right away, that's it, and I wish that it could be done today, like they did to us. That's all I can say. - Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. street, what's going on? - Can I ask you to keep filming? I'm gonna go get another tape. - I can't get off the island. I can't get off the island. Yeah, I'm okay, Mom. All right, okay. Love you, too, bye. Yeah, dude, I was 15 minutes away from being in that building. - You must know a lot of people in that building. - Hell yeah, my whole floor. - Which building do you work in? - I work 38th floor on. - Oh my God are you kidding? - I was 15 minutes. I'm getting all these calls. My mom just called. - Yeah, can't get through to anybody. - Hello? Hey, I was late for work 'cause I watched Monday Night Football last, Monday Night Football saved my life. I was 15 minutes away from being in that building. - Yeah, we copy. Yes, I can just about make you out. If you speak slowly enough, I can answer all the questions you have. It is hard to tell from this point. Again, because I am exactly five miles away from it. No, I can't really give you an honest opinion on that. I will tell you that the fire appears to be spreading, rather than subsiding, and, again, obviously, there's firefighting issues, trying to get water up that high, but I really can't tell you whether or not the building is leaning or not. - Frank? - Frank? - I'm out here, I just called in. - Frank? - Frank? - Where'd he go, where'd he go? - We've gotta get out of here. - Oh my God. - You guys, the other one might collapse. - You have to get out of here. - Let's just walk to the river. - Oh, shit. - Here's your choices, Brooklyn Bridge or the street. Please go this way. Thank you very much. You too, please. - .. that's totally enveloped Lower Manhattan. What we can tell you is the critical thing for people to do right now if you are in lower Manhattan, move north, slowly and orderly. You need to keep the streets clear, folks. You have to get out of this area, track north. There are no trains running through this area, and really it's a scene that's still developing. It is a fluid scene, and people need to realize they need to get out of here. - The fire continues to burn there. - Yeah. - And there have to be questions on the part of the fire department at this point about the structural integrity of that building and whether they want to send any people in because they try to respond to these things by sending fire fighters up the stairs to fight the fire, but when you're talking about an explosion of this magnitude, that amount jet fuel up there, they would have to ask themselves questions about whether they want to send those men in to fight the fire or just let it burn itself out. - How many, how many masks did you get? How many masks did you get? - Watch your back fella. - Chief, can I ask you a real quick question? What are they telling you? Like what are you suppose to do? What's your plan? What's that? - I can't tell you anything, I'm sorry. - Just not in any terms of what happened, but we're just trying to figure out what - We're just putting on equipment right now. - Oh my God. - Oh. - Oh my God. - Both towers down. I hope they evacuated everybody out of that area because. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - We've got to get out of here. - Holy shit. - Oh my God. - Does anybody see Kenny, over? - Don't do it, Danny, just suck it in. - We're heading down towards One World Trade Center. - We are unable to make any kind of communication, over. - Oh, I don't see any building. - What? - Oh my. - There are fire fighters and there are police. - Oh my God. - As quickly as possible. People who are near the area are - Nothing sweetheart, go lie down. - The top of the building just collapsed. - Go lie down, baby. Turn around, lie down. - Get daddy to erase the whole tape. - Devastating toll. The World Trade Center is no more. - There you see it. - Oh my God. - Earlier One World Trade Center collapsed. Now you can see the collapse of the second tower. - Oh my God. - Move over. - Michael don't lose me. Don't lose me. - Ma'am, are you okay? Do you need some water? It's okay, it's okay. - I think that was the second building going down. - Oh, shit. Thank the ing god we got out of there. - Unbelievable. It seems, which way do you think it fell? It seemed to fall straight down. It seems that maybe some of it might have fallen over towards the Hudson River a little bit. - What happened? - It collapsed. The top floors collapsed down. I saw it blow and then ran like hell. Thank God, I'm 69, but I can still run. There's gotta be firemen trapped back there, though. - Anyone here emergency Does anybody have - What's your location? - And I thought it was thunder, but there is blue sky, so there's no way it could be thunder, so I stayed out there, whoa. - Can I ask you a couple of questions? - I'd rather not. Bad day, thank you. Do you know where everybody's going? - No, I don't. - They're evacuating everybody from the area. It's gonna be okay. We gotta go. I gotta try to get home. - Spencer it was exploded. - First, was it like when it exploded? - Yeah, look Spencer. It's not there anymore, the World Trade Center. Right, Dadda? It's not there anymore. - As I was filming Callie watching the towers burn, I had this impression that I was maybe, using her. - Hey, honey, how's it going? - What's up? - Where've you been? - Hey Rexie. Just chillin'. - I had the idea of maybe I shouldn't do this, but that notion went away quickly, and I kept filming. Often when I look back at the footage, I'm glad that I didn't stop filming. I'm proud that the footage I took could help others understand how people felt that day. - You wanna sit out here? - Yeah. - Yeah I remember, vividly. I believe it was my first day of kindergarten, actually, and I was sick. A lot of people think when you're a child and you see horrific things, it doesn't affect them as much, but I feel like it kind of affects you a little more 'cause you're more vulnerable. Like I don't think about it all the time, but when it's brought up, it definitely brings back a lot of memories, bad memories. - As I recall, your mother kept trying to have you go back into our bedroom. - Yeah, she was like, "Go watch Dora." - To watch cartoons, and just to keep you away. - And I couldn't 'cause of all the stimulation, and Mom was like crying, and we had no clue what to do. It was like the first time something like this has ever happened. I mean, I'm four years old, and it was just not a great day, yeah. - We stayed at your grandmother's place for three days in Putnam County. - Okay, so I guess-- - We left because the city, it smelled so bad. It smelled like burning rubber. It was terrible. There was just a lot of bad air. And I remember when I got there just sitting looking out at the lawn just sort of in a daze. - What do you do to be safe? - My knee pads and my helmet. - Oh, okay, and that keeps you safe, right? - Yeah. - Okay, are you fast on the scooter? - So, four days after September 11th, Callie's mother and I decided to separate, and there was a feeling of, "Well I don't know if I'm gonna be alive tomorrow." 'Cause we didn't know, and there was a lot of fear. We have not revisited that subject since. - Well, yeah, we haven't necessarily talked about it, but every year we do watch it together, and it brings back a lot of emotions. - A lot of couples looked at themselves, and said, "What if we're not around tomorrow? "I wanna be happy today.", after September 11th. - Shit. - I've been in regular contact with the vice-president, secretary of defense, the National Security Team, and my cabinet. We've taken all appropriate security precautions to protect the American people. - We will assist you guys to New Jersey. I can't answer any individual questions at this time. Everyone has to listen as a group. Long Island Rail Road limited service in the subways. Long Island Rail Road, limited service. - 34th and 12th otherwise go over the 59th street bridge, that's it.
