Rick we barely even know each other! - [Jenny] Do you know what time it is? - Um, 10:30 I think. - I wanted to sleep in, ugh. What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at school? Isn't it a school day? - Not until noon. End of school picnic. - Really, they still have those? Those always suck. - Mom. - Shit, I'll try to be more positive. I'm getting better at that though, haven't you noticed? - You're doing great Mom. - Thank you. - Why do you always have to do that? I mean, it's still morning. - Cramps. Much better! (laughing) Baby Bird is finishing sixth grade! That is so wild! Oh I can't be that old. Am I really that old? Ugh. You know what you should do? Stay home from school and watch movies with me. Watch movies with me all day, yes, yes! - You can't make me stay home from school. (giggling) - God you are a weird kid. - Coffee? (gentle music) - Thank you Baby Bird. - There's seriously nothing in here. There's like pickles and yogurt. - That is not true. There's like corned beef hash and french fries I brought home from work last night. - I can't keep eating your diner food. - Stop complaining, it's not that bad if you nuke it first. I hate grocery shopping. - Then let me do it. I keep asking you and you never let me do it. - No! - Why? - Kids do not grocery shop. It's like, wrong. - But then you wouldn't be all crabby about doing it and then we'd have apples and eggs and stuff. - Okay, I am totally not crabby. - You're totally crabby. - Those are Grandma's. - She's in India. Besides, she told me I could wear her stuff. - She didn't tell me that. - Well. - [Jenny] They're too big for you. - I know. - Well you better be super careful and not get anything on them otherwise she'll never stop giving me crap. - I will.

(laughing) You're not bleeding, you got your first period! Oh Arlo she got her first period. - Oh. - Mom! - Honey! You've got your period! - I think I'm gonna just step out for a smoke.

Honey, Baby Bird, this is a really great moment, you got your period! - Mom, stop it! - Okay, okay. What? (coughing) Okay. In an ideal world what would you want me to do right now because I can do it. I mean Grandma is gonna flip over those jeans but let's not talk about that right now. But I mean when I got my first period she did not handle it well, she was all like "here's a pamphlet, "I hope you don't have any questions." And then slam. - I was at the picnic. In white jeans. Okay, everybody saw. That girl Rachel told everybody! I don't even know what to do! ♪ Da da da da da ♪ - Happy first day of your first period. - You're not helping. - I am trying to cheer you up.

Old enough to bleed, old enough to breed. - Dude! - Dude you don't even know what that means. - Hey man. - Hey. - She home? - Yeah. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do that if I were you. - Why not? Can you just give this to her please? - Which her? - Robin, she's in my class. - Oh you mean Bird. - Yeah. - Alright, will do. - Alright cool. Oh sorry. - Will you show me? - What? - You know. The stuff. - The stuff? It's not really like that. - It better not be. - Okay, you know I can do this. Yeah I mean that is, nobody stands when they do it. Okay so, it, you know, you're like that, and then, you know, you open up a thing and you're like right up in there, maybe this way. And you're like in its spot. You know mine veers a little to the left so you never really know. - You're terrible at this. - I am trying. - I want Lilli. - Okay. Find a comfortable position. That's bullshit. You're just gonna want to squat down and find something to hold onto so you don't fall. - I could fall? - Blah blah blah, into vaginal canal, blah, I mean seriously, who wrote this. Man, you are gonna push this thing all the way into your vagina. You understand about vaginas, you know how to find it? - I think so. - Okay, good. So once this is really in there you're gonna push this thing up like this, (pops), out that comes, you're gonna pull this stuff out, this is the only thing that stays in here. You have a little cotton tail so you can pull it out again later. - Right, make sure you don't lose it up there or forget about it. - Wait, I could lose it? - It sometimes does. - It doesn't get lost. - How many times do I have to do this? - It depends. - On what? - On the flow. - Yeah. - And how many days? - Like about five. - Like eight. - Jesus. Okay well there's your tampon, here's your mirror. Good luck, let's go. - I should have told her about all this. Crap, I totally should have told her about this right? - It's okay, she's gonna be fine. - I am not ready for this. She is a baby! - You are gonna be fine. - [Bird] It didn't work. - Hey. Go get me a pair of your underwear. - Yeah. - Oh my god. Make sure it's clean! - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, so there's another option, there's um, oh here we go! The pad. As I like to call it, the diaper. Why the diaper you might ask? Well because. They're itchy, they're hot, they make you waddle like a duck. - They have wings. - They have wings, that is right. And so... Goddamnit. Just like so. And you go like that and you put it up, ba ba ba. (pops) - Oh I hate those things, I only wear 'em if I have to double down. - [Lilli] Give me one of those. - Hey, you quit. - Not today my friend, not today. (lighter clicking) I've been so worried about this. - About, yeah, well. (clears throat) You know I guess I have to say that you know I think it's probably you know it's, I think... I've got nothing, I don't know. (laughing) - That's right, you don't have any sisters do you? - No. I got a mom. Bit of a narcissist, workaholic father. That's it. - Explains so much. (laughing) - Screw you. - Celeste is not gonna kiss me for a week because I've been smoking. (laughing) - Doesn't this count as an emergency? - Yeah, it does for Jenny. Oh what can you do? I'll see you soon my friend. - Love you. - [Lilli] Love you too. - [Bird] Sorry I made you sleep on a maxi pad. - Please don't go. - I actually do have to go. - No! Stupid band practice. I bet you were a sexy nerdy band guy, weren't you? You were. Please don't go, it's my night off. - But you know Bird probably needs some... Some time with you. But I could maybe sneak in after she goes to sleep. - Arlo, I'm scared. - I know. - Hi! - Mom! - What? Popcorn? - No! - Okay. - Oh crap. I hate this banana. Can we please take it down? - I love that banana! I painted that, you know? - Yeah, I know. - Oh god I just realized. - What? - I could be a grandma. - What? - Once you get your period you can have babies and if you can have babies then I can be a grandma. I can't be grandma! - That's disgusting! - I know! It's totally freaking me out! - Mom. Stop talking. - Do we need to talk about sex? I mean I realize I should've talked to you about the whole period thing sooner, but do we need to have the sex talk? Do I need to buy you a box of condoms? - [Bird] Oh my god. - Grandma has the Magic of Sex around here somewhere and it has really good pictures. - Mom, you know what? Stop talking now. Okay I've just had the worst day of my life. Everyone knows! Carlos knows. - Mmm. Who's Carlos? Is he your boyfriend? Why didn't you tell me? Okay. Oh hey. Do you like me in this dress? - No, Grandma's gonna kill you! - You're no fun. - Ugh! - Ugh! - Ugh! - Please don't tell me you're smoking in my bed. Listen honey, you were never good at this, any of it Jennifer. Every transition she's ever made. You didn't even like it when she started to get teeth. - That's not true. I loved her tiny teeth, they were like little pearls. - Yeah but you complained about it for two years. - I am not good at this. I wanna be good at it. But I mean when I went on the rag you totally sucked! - Well life is suffering. - For you. So how is live on the 'shram? - What can I say? - I'm, you know, I'm living my fondest dream. I may never come back. Don't get any ideas. - So there actually is some bad news. - Hit me. - The pants that Baby was wearing today, they were your white ones. - That's fine, that's fine. It's just an object. - What? You just jumped down my ass for smoking in bed? That's just an object. - That's because I don't want to see you immolate yourself and my granddaughter in a blaze of selfish idiocy! Come on. - Same time next week? - Love you both. - Love you Mommy. (screaming) - There's blood, there's blood everywhere. - What the hell? What did you do? - What do you mean what did I do? There's blood everywhere, Mom, I'm bleeding! - Did you wear a pad, did you wear one of the big ones, did you do it right? - Yes I did it right! I put on the pads that Lilli showed me, I did it exactly how she told me to. - God baby girl at night with gravity and shit you have to wear one of the big ones. They were right next to the wimpy ones, didn't you see? - I thought it would be enough, okay? So now I'm just someone who bleeds, for the rest of my life I'm gonna bleed. Just gush out of me, just bleeding, this is gonna be all the time I'm just gonna bleed. - Okay. Wow. Wow. - I'm bleeding. I'm never gonna stop bleeding. (coughing) It's never gonna end. - Okay. Let's do this. Baby Bird, go take a shower. (upbeat music) - I'm not leaving the house while I'm bleeding. What if I bleed all over everything? What if I'm just going to walk down the street and then suddenly blood starts gushing out of me? - [Jenny] You are not gonna gush. This is a moment. This is a moment and I wanna take you to pancakes so can we go now? - I don't want pancakes! Or a bubble bath, okay? Or ice cream, because that's what would make you feel better. - [Jenny] Hormonal much? - [Bird] And will you stop smoking pot all the time? - What? Look. If you don't like pancakes anymore, that is-- - Well you know what, I Christ on a shit-sucking, butt filled cracker don't wanna have pancakes with you. - Okay Baby Bird, I will give you that one. - [Bird] Don't call me that anymore. - Call you what? - Baby Bird. - It's your name! - No it's not! (groans) I am not a baby. - But you looked just like a baby bird when you were born. I wanted to call you that but Mommy wouldn't let me. She broke me down. - Why are we never in here? - [Jenny] 'Cause this is Grandma's space. - Isn't it all Grandma's? - [Jenny] Huh. - And it's Bird. - What bird? - That's what everyone calls me. - Like who? Oh my god is that my shirt? - Everyone calls me that like Lilli and Arlo. - Since when? - Since we left the Valley! (groaning) - Crap. I know that you didn't want to come here but it makes things so much easier for me! - It was great there, okay? No one thought I was a dork anymore. I got to live next to my best friend and I wasn't bleeding all over everything. - Seriously just Bird like not Baby or Baby Bird? - You say I'm a woman now and I'm gonna have sex with everyone I see and then oh yeah, I'm gonna turn you into some sort of creepy grandma? Yeah, blood is pouring out of me and ya suck. (scoffs) - Come on. (slaps) Okay, you are on the rag and you need to like eat some chocolate or something. - Then let me go grocery shopping! - You can't go grocery shopping! (groaning) - I'm not a baby. I don't need baby things, right, 'cause I'm a woman. I don't need dolls or toys to play with. I can't have any of this anymore. - Baby Bird, Bird. - My childhood is over. - You are a kid! - And I'm bleeding! (sighing) - You know what? Screw pancakes. She won't let me. No. Hey, is that woo woo lady thing still happening at Mona's? Yeah? Wait what? I have to make the phone call. I have to call people? Oh god thank you. - Is Celeste gonna make me talk about my vagina? - Is Celeste gonna make her talk about her vagina? Probably. - Oh my god. - Bird, ah! - [Bird] Hi Celeste. - Tell me all about what's going on with you. - I think Lilli already told you. Got my period. - Ah your first period! How exciting! So how are you feeling? Do you have any cramps, any soreness in the breasts, bloating, diarrhea, mood swings? - Mood swings. - Mood swings. - Mood swings. Girl, welcome to the sisterhood. - [Jenny] I mean she does live in the house, we do share a bathroom. It's bound to happen. - [Arlo] Maybe we should do the ribbon on the doorknob thing. - She's a kid. That's a little inappropriate to be like hey, here's a sock on the door. - What is more inappropriate? What are my options? I feel like some preemptive strategy. - A little bit? No. - Hey, I got a question. - Yeah? - What's going on here? - What do you mean? - What do I mean? I mean what's going on with you and me? - With you and me? - Yeah. - Everything's cool. - Everything's cool. That's your answer. Well maybe you know what maybe cool, maybe cool isn't cool enough. - Aren't I supposed to be the one that's like where is this going? - Yeah well maybe it should be you. - Arlo this conversation's giving me a headache. - Alright I'll put it another way. How do you hear it when you say it in your head? I blank Arlo. Fill in the blank. - This is such a waste of break time. We could be having sex in the very big backseat of your car. - I'm waiting. - Why don't you come back to my place at midnight? - I'll be there five minutes after midnight. - I gave her one of the biggest pads I could find. I feel so bad. - It was like a freak horrorshow this morning. Ah! Really? - Mm hmm. - Oh. I love you! Did Bird tell you that I sort of kind of slapped her? - Yes. - My mom slapped me once and I never forgave her for that. - Well now you know. - Did you make the phone calls for tomorrow? - Celeste made the phone calls. Just a reminder, tomorrow's about Bird, not about you. - Duh. But it's gonna be awesome. She's gonna have such a good time. - Yay. - Now listen. I'm only coming in with my treats if you tell me you love me. - It's raining outside. - Do you love me or not? - Come on. - No. - Come on. - No, I'm putting my foot down. - Come on. - [Arlo] Oh wait, do you love me? You do, don't you? - You know I think I may actually. - What's that? Really? - Mm hmm. - Doesn't count. - Why not? - Why not? - Mm hmm? - Well first of all you're stoned and secondly you just had a very high dose of vitamin C and lastly I am playing bongos on your butt. (laughing) But that's okay, that's alright. I'll wait for the real thing. (drumming) This bother you? - [Jenny] Hey keep going. (drumming) - Why won't you tell me? - Shut up, you're gonna love it. - Robin, welcome. - It's Bird now. - Bird? (holistic music) Women, virgins, mothers, crones. May we all welcome the beautiful Bird who is having her very first period. (cheering and clapping) (singing) - [Jenny] It's really sticky. - This is really exciting moment in your life. It's like having a telephone right into your body. (laughing) - You don't remember the story? - What? - I told you on our second date. So anyway... - So my friends would come over and we'd look at it and we'd laugh and then when the stuff actually started happening to us we didn't laugh so much anymore. - Yeah. (laughing) - Earth. Air. Fire. Water. We resonate with your tides. (tambourine shaking) Oh Mother Moon, bless young Bird as she flies away. Descending to the world of nonbeing. Jennifer, mother of this child. What do you say on this, her passing? - I can't believe I'm this old. (crying) (upbeat music) (singing) (laughing) (drumming) My vagina is impressed. (clapping) Baby Bird! Bird. I have to leave for work in an hour. I'm not chasing after you. I don't do that. (gentle music) - That was so dope. - Yeah that was tight man. - She was so pissed. - Not again. - [Richard] Dude come on, shut up. - Just give me a minute okay? - [Richard] Maybe we should just leave her alone this time. - [Carlos] I just want to talk to her. - Haven't you seen Carrie? Girl gets her period, all the other girls scream plug it up, plug it up! That chick burns down the whole school bro. The whole thing. - You should like get her a present or something like a necklace or flowers. I dunno, girls like it. - Let's go. (light music) - Gum? You look different today. Is it your birthday? - No, no my mom made me go to this party. There were these people chanting and I had to pretend like I was dead in a kiddie pool. It was totally creepy. - That's wild. You know with my sisters my parents just took them out to dinner. - You have big sisters? - Mm hmm, yeah. Four. I brought your book back the other day. - Thanks. - I looked at some of the pictures as well. You like to read those big books, huh? - Do you like to read? - I like comic books. Have three boxes this long. My cousin wrote one that's actually pretty epic. - Is that the same one that did the song? - No, that's another cousin. - How many cousins do you have? - A lot. - My mom tried to take me to pancakes. - And you didn't let her? Who doesn't like pancakes? (clock chiming) - I better get going. - Hey, what do they call you? Your people I mean. Your name's different in school. What do they call you? - Bird. They call me Bird. - See you around Bird. - [Bird] So if I'm gonna bleed for one week out of every month that's 25%, right? - Right. - I mean that's a quarter of my life bleeding. What's the point of living a life like that? - Well. There's having children, that's a beautiful thing. - What's a beautiful thing, you? Hi Baby Bird. - Hey. But you guys don't have any kids. - We like other people's kids. - Why? - Meh. - I'm never having kids. I mean I already have my mom. (knocking) - You brought your guitar. - I'm working on a song.

All that, you know, turning around and spinning the board and stuff? - Um, no. No it's not too hard but not anyone can do it. But you know it's not too complicated. - I make guitars and it's kind of the same thing. So can you show me a couple moves? - Not today man. - Why? - First you gotta put on some different shoes. - Oh right. Okay. - So you're a guitar player? What's your name? - Arlo. And yeah, I am a guitar player. - Nice to meet you Arlo. That's a cool name. I'm Carlos. - Also a good name. - So like we have the same exact name except my name starts with a C and ends with an S. - That's right. Huh. That's cool, that's very cool. So are you Bird's... - Her mom's your lady? - Uh, my lady, yeah. Yeah well I'm working on it. Gotta go for these things in life, you know? You gotta go for 'em even if... So um, so show me something. - Alright. (laughs) It's called an alley oop. - That's an alley oop? - Yeah. - I like that. - Thanks. I made it up myself. - You did? - Yeah. - You mind if I give it a go? Don't worry about the shoes. - Are you sure? - Don't worry about the shoes. - Being a woman means having to put up with a certain amount of shit. And having your period is just one of them. - I refuse to believe that. I want the pill. The ring, I want the patch, an IUD, and every single thing that will stop this from happening to me again. (coughing) - So I just did an alley oop. - She keeps rejecting every attempt I make to cheer her up like I'm the bad guy, like I'm the bad guy. Am I the bad guy? - Jenny you know this isn't happening to you, right? - Who the hell do you think it's happening to? - It's happening to Bird. (muffled screaming) (sighs) - Arlo, can you do me a really big favor? Can you like take Baby Bird and go for a walk or have a nice talk with her? Anything to give me a break from my daughter's demonic possession? (muffled screaming) Please? - Sure. (knocking) Hello? Hey. Uh... Is it cool to come in? (groaning) I'll take that as a yes. - She wants you to have a talk with me, doesn't she? - Yeah. - I'll take that as a yes. - Yes. She might have mentioned something. I enjoy talking to you so it wasn't a big ask. I think it's pretty cool. It's grown up, you know? Sometimes it's tricky but I think it's pretty cool. You're doing great. - You think it's cool that blood is pouring out of me? - Oh. - That's strange. - I mean not that specifically. That's cool too though. - The hormones, the mood swings, you think that's all cool? - Love this bedspread. - [Bird] Can we not talk about it? Just pretend like we had a good talk and she won't know the difference? - [Arlo] However you wanna play it. - Oh no. - What? - Those kids are gonna be here. That girl Rachel I bet she's gonna be here. Can we go now please, please? - It'll be fine Bird, it'll be fine, don't worry. - You can't promise that. - It'll be fine. - No one can promise that anymore. - What are you gonna do? You gonna avoid parks for the rest of my life? - You know all the girls in my class are already like, you know, active. - You mean they got the painters in? They're riding the crimson wave? - No, I mean like, you know, blow jobs and hand jobs and balls and tits, it's revolting. - Oh look, there's the food dude. You wanna get some fruit? Uh okay. Okay. So hmm. Balls, really? - That's her. - Oh, that's okay. Hello. - What's up shark week? - Suck shit. - Whoa, Bird! - What did he just call you? Bird?

I am up to my ass in commitment. - Okay Jenny. Do you want me to step up to the plate here or not? Because I can't go halfway. - I'm having a really bad week. - You're having a bad week, really? Well your kid's freaking out. I, my day, yeah it started out okay, yeah, then it went (mimics explosion).

You're being a dick. Take a shower and clean yourself up. - [Bird] Who was that? - Lilli. - No, who was the guy? - Um, the guy was no one, he was Gabriel who bought me a drink. - You were supposed to be picking me up! - I had a bad day. Arlo and I had a fight. - What about? - I am not telling you that. You are a kid. There are things, things that grownups don't tell kids. - You are not a grownup. I'm the grownup! All the time around here, okay? I am the grownup. - Okay, you can be the grownup, see if I care. - Fine, I will! (door slams) Mommy! - Oh god. - Mommy! I want some pot. - What?

She was the one who hit me the other day. - Okay. Why'd you steal a box of tampons? - Well the ones at my house are really weird and giant, purple, it's just really weird so I came here and we ran out of pads and I hate the pads, they just always crinkle when you walk and you can feel them and then sometimes you can just end up bleeding like everywhere. - Have you been drinking any or eat anything strange? You been smoking? Is there something you wanna tell me? It's okay, you can talk to me. - What is going on? My car was still at the diner. - Miss. - Styles. Jenny Styles. - This is your daughter? - Yeah, Bird. Robin, her real name is Robin but we call... What's going on? - Your daughter got caught stealing this box of tampons. - Bird, come on! - I think she's been smoking marijuana also. - Come on! - Miss can I speak to you for a moment? - Those are mine, oh my god those are mine. - Ma'am. Now look the situation is usually pretty (mumbling). What concerns me is the pot. How old is she? - 11. No, 12. - You have sole custody of her? - Of course, she's my kid, of course I have sole custody of her. - Okay. What happened today? She got bullied. She's been in a fight. The girl was here and she needed money. Now this is all something you should be handling. She's 12 and you're... - 30. - Get your act together. Keep the marijuana away from your kid. I'm assuming it's yours, right? Keep the marijuana away from the kid and get this girl some tampons. Take care of yourself, okay? - You brought the cops down on us? - No, I'm sorry. - Come on. You know I am supposed to be at work right now? - [Arlo] What's going on? - She was caught shoplifting these. She got into my pot and went shoplifting high. - Well that shouldn't be too hard. - Am I gonna go to jail? - No sweetheart. - What? - Getting into your pot. - What's that supposed to mean? - Means it's always out, lying around. She's a kid. - Yeah, she's my kid so it's none of your business. - Where were you last night? - I was home. What? - After work I went by to talk to you some more and you had already left but you weren't here. And you haven't been answering my calls. - He bought her a drink. - Who bought her a drink? - Bird, nobody. - Nobody bought you a drink. - Nobody bought me a drink, I had a drink and then I came home, big deal. - How did you get home? - [Bird] Gabriel. - Who's Gabriel? - [Bird] He bought her a drink. - Come on Jen, what is this? - Go in the house Bird. - [Bird] No. - Bird! Go in the house! - Really Jenny? Seriously? I love you. You know that. Bird, I love you too. - So what, I get to be the bad guy with you too? Great, just bail. Arlo. Oh my god, you are ruining my life. Ruining it! I don't know what makes you think you can act like that and it's not gonna cause problems for me. What were you thinking? Narcing me out for having a drink? - I like Arlo! He's nice to me. - And I'm not? I don't do nice things for you? God you used to be such a nice kid! - Yes I used to be such a nice kid! But now I can't even be a kid anymore. And no, you're not nice to me. You don't let me do what I wanna do. - What do you wanna do? - I wanna go grocery shopping with real money so I can just buy my own tampons instead of having to steal it! Okay? I want to have a mom who could pick me up for once! Just once, could you please pick me up for once? I want to have friends again, I wanna go home! I want a real mom. I hate you so much. I wish you never had me. - Fine. Get in the car. - Where are we going? (thunder rumbling) - I'm giving her to you. Here, take her. Do whatever you do with them. Put her up for adoption. Whatever. - I'm sorry, what's going on here? - Safe baby drop off. No questions asked. She's all yours. - Yeah safe baby drop off, she's a kid. - I know my rights. I have until she's 18. You have to take her. - Is that right? That can't be right. - Have a nice life. - Mom! - Um... Okay I'm not sure... You know what? Let me get someone, okay? - She left me. - I know kid, I know. I'm just, I'm not sure... - She left me. She left me. - Can I get you a bottle of water or something? - No. - Here you go. Okay kid, stay here. I'm gonna go get someone. Just stay here. (murmuring) - I want to go to the Valley. I've got cash. - Okay. - Where is she? - I just walked in here. We were trying to figure out who to call. - And you let her leave? What is wrong with you, she's just a kid! - [Arlo] Hello? - [Jenny] Arlo, she's gone. Bird is gone. - What, where did she go, what happened? Tell me. - I left her. I left her at the fire station. - The fire... Wait, was there a fire? - No. Safe baby drop off. - Safe baby. - I was so angry at her, I didn't mean it, but I just dropped her off and then she left. God I'm a terrible person, I'm terrible. Arlo? I know that you are really mad at me and you have every right to be. I have been acting like a dick and I see that now I just, I really need you to help me find Bird, please. - Okay. Where do you think she would go? - Lilli's maybe? Maybe she called her? - She doesn't have a cell phone right? - [Jenny] No. - Does she have any money? - Yeah. - Do you think she might have gone home? - I don't know, she is really angry at me right now. - No I mean home home, like Reseda home. - Why would she go... Oh, maybe, maybe, yeah, she might have. - Call Lilli and go home. - No no no no no, Arlo I can't go home. I have to look for her. - Jenny. If Bird comes home you need to be there. You need to be there for her. You hear what I'm saying? - Yes. - Okay. I'm gonna go to the Valley. - [Taxi Driver] If you just told me an address. - I can find it. Okay I lived here for almost a whole year, okay? I can find it. - Bird, Bird, is she here? (gentle twangy music) - [Taxi Driver] Not a street name? - I don't remember. - [Taxi Driver] What about a number? - Um...I don't know, I think it started with a 12. That's it, right over there. - Are you sure? Looks like every other apartment house we've seen tonight. - Yeah, I'm sure. (doorbell rings) - Yes? - Hi Mrs. Allen. - Oh my gosh, Robin. What are you wearing? Is your mom... - She's over... Can I come in? I really want to talk to Amy. - I'm sorry, Amy's not here, she went to a little party over at, uh, honey, what's that girl's name? - [Man] Synthia, with an S. - She's over at Synthia's. Do you know where that is? - Jen. Jen. - Please don't. Not right now. Just please don't. - I see everything. - I get it, okay? I finally get it this time. Just... Not right now. And thank you. (crying) (upbeat pop music) (knocking) - Yeah? - Synthia it's me, Robin. - Robin, what are you doing here? - I need to talk to Amy. Can I talk to her? - Yeah, but we're all like kind of in the middle of something right now. - What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. Can I just talk to you for like a minute? - Go ahead. - It's a totally supervised party, I mean-- - Yeah. - I just thought she'd rather be there than here. - Sure, sure. So can you give me the address? - Yeah, it's-- - At her friend's house in the Valley so I'm gonna pick her up, I'm just a couple blocks away. - What are you wearing? You're like, you're a mess. - Um, I smoked pot. I almost got arrested and I got really really pissed at my mom so now Arlo's gone and she dropped me off at a fire station. And now everything's just really, really screwed up. - Jeez. I mean, that's too bad and stuff, but, um... We're kind of in the middle of something. - With Synthia? With stuck up Synthia? Do you even remember how we used to laugh about her? About how she was never, ever nice to us? She treated us like we were invisible. - Yeah well... I dunno. - What are you guys even doing in there? - We're playing seven minutes in heaven. You know, you get locked in with a guy for seven minutes. It's okay. - I got my first period. - Jeez Robin. Grow up. That happened for me like months ago. - I only moved away from here like three months ago. - Yeah well... - It happened in front of everyone. Look, I've had a really, really bad week. I guess I just wanted to come home and see you. Guess I can't now right. - Yo doll, there you are. You had me worried girl. Come on, no calls, no texts. We were supposed to meet for cocktails like an hour ago. Arlo, Bird's boyfriend. How you doing? So what do you guys got going here? Little party? - So? You don't wanna hang out at a lame Valley party, do you? - Not anymore. - So not your style. Shall we? Ladies. You do what you had to do? - I did. - Well kid, you know what they say about the Valley. - No, what? - The Valley sucks. You are an LA woman now. - Yeah. Fuck the Valley. - You okay? - I went home. (knocking) - [Jenny] Can I come in? - Yeah. Is Arlo mad at me? - No. - Is Arlo mad at you? Are you mad at me? - You must wanna kill me. I would. - If there was a place I could drop you off I would've too. - [Jenny] I can't believe I did that. - You did that. - [Jenny] That was a terrible thing to do. - Yeah it was. - You are so smart, Bird. So much smarter than me and sometimes I just can't believe that you're my kid. And then I go and I mess it up. I just love you so much. And I know that I am a mess as a mom and... - You can be a pretty cool mom. - I really screwed this one up though. - Yeah. - I'm getting better, right? Calling you the right name. - Totally. - So. What was it like back in the Valley, what did you see? - Um... It was kind of like it wasn't really there anymore. - Like it wasn't there, huh? - I'm never going back. - You don't ever have to go back, Bird. Do you need anything? Like water, extra blanket, really big giant purple tampon? (laughs) - No, I'm good. - Okay. - Hey Mom? - Yeah. - How come you never apologize for anything? - Um... I don't know. Um... I guess 'cause if I don't apologize, then it can always be someone else's fault. But I never wanted it to feel like it was yours, that's awful. (phone vibrating) Um, Grandma messaged and said that they are singing a special bjang for you today at the 'shram. - Really? - Mm hmm. - That's pretty cool. But what's a bjang? - It's a song. Special just for you. Which is pretty cool. - Yeah. - Good, good, good. Whoops. I love you. Awesome. Okay. - I learned how to take a cab. (laughing) - Wow. Do we wanna talk about that? - No. I love you. - Really? - Mm hmm. - Well. I'm afraid that's not gonna cut it. But you are getting warmer. - I love you. - There we go. (gentle music) (tapping) (murmuring) You literally have nothing in your refrigerator. - [Jenny] That's not true, there's like yogurt or something like that. - Just gonna see what I make. Okay. Oh my, really? There's a french fry in here, in the yogurt. - Gimme that. Mm. - Wow, really? Okay. I've never tried that. It's not great. - Okay, okay. - Morning. What are you guys doing up? - We are making the coffee this morning. - Hey mom? - Mm hmm. - [Arlo] What? I wanna know. Oh, yeah. Nice. Good work. - Yeah. - Good work. You, you got this. - [Jenny] Oh I got this, I got this. I think. - Hey. - Hey. - Um... I just wanted to say thank you for stopping by the other day. - It's cool. - Alright well I gotta go do something. Have fun skateboarding. You're getting better. At skating, since we moved here. I've been watching you. A lot better. - You've been watching me? - Yeah. (laughs) - You know when you first moved in the house I thought you were pretty. Now I think you're really pretty.
