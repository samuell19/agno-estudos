It's not 7:45. - It wasn't my fault. But it doesn't matter, we were late, we missed 'em. Let's just go home. - No, no, no. It'll work, it'll work. It'll work, we'll grab just her, just her. (door clicks) (Eunice screams) - Get in the car! Get in the car and shut up, shut up! (woman screams) - Lay down. - Tie her up! (tires squealing) (dark funky music) (woman moaning) - Leave it! - [Eunice] Please, oh, oh! (dramatic music) Oh, oh! Oh! (woman grunts) Please, oh! - [Man] Shut up, shut up! (Eunice moans) (ominous music) - [Man] Lay down and be quiet. - What are you gonna do with me? - I'll tell you that when we get there. Just be quiet and you cooperate, nothing's gonna happen to you. (dramatic music) (clattering) This way, watch your head. (steps clattering) (door clicks) Okay, step up, one more. (steps clattering) - Can we untie her? - Yeah, yeah, go ahead. - [Eunice] How long are we going to be here? - If everyone cooperates, we should be out of here in a couple of hours. - [Eunice] Why did you pick me? - Actually... - We picked your name out of a hat, Eunice. (laughs) - We got it out of a directory. - All right, all right, you just be quiet, okay. Now look, we're just gonna have to be patient and we're gonna have to sit here and wait until we get the money, okay? - When will that be? - Soon as we get a hold of your husband at the bank. - You better, you better get going. He is not an easy many to reach. You see, he's... - Yeah, yeah, we know that, Eunice okay. But it's out of our hands now. - [Eunice] What do you mean? - It's up to the other guys. - Other, what other guys? - Well, see there's a couple other guys doing the negotiating. All we gotta do is wait. - What other guys are you talking about? There aren't any other guys. - No, there ain't no other guys. Now you make a call, huh? You tell him to get him as much money as he can and bring it to a gas station at 66th and Lindale. - 66th and Lindale. - Got it? - Yeah. - Okay. - The car's in the garage. - Uh Betty, keep trying to get Eunice, will you? I'm gonna go out and I'll be back in half and hour or so. Okay, thank you very much. - He's out to lunch right now, perhaps if you'd leave a name and a number. I could have him call. (phone clacking) Grover State Bank. - Hello, I'd like to speak with Mr. Kronholm. - I'm sorry sir, I just saw him leave the building. Would you like to speak to his secretary? - No, nevermind, nevermind. This is dumb, it ain't gonna work, ain't gonna work! (heavy breathing) - Listen Eunice, tell me something will ya, how come you and your husband didn't go to work together this morning? - We never do. - What do you mean, you never do? You work at the bank, don't ya? - No, no I don't work at the bank. I'm a nurse. - A nurse? - Well, yes. I've been in charge of health services at the Bethel College. I've taught psychiatric and surgical nursing. I've never worked at the bank. - One of your daughters work at the bank? - Both of them have. - Is one of them named after you? - No, neither of them is Eunice. (thuds) - You know something Eunice, you're lucky. I mean, you're lucky you're not with one of those other guys. I think one of them's a sadist. I mean, he'd have to be to do some of the things he does. Course, I'm not such a nice guy myself, Eunice. I sometimes think I should see a psychiatrist. I could be pretty ugly. I can be pretty ugly, Eunice. (ominous music) - She hasn't been in today. All right, thank you very much. - Have you been able to reach Eunice? - No, I haven't, but I'll keep trying. - All right, thank you. - Since I don't know your name, would it be all right if I just kind of made one up for ya? Why don't I just call you Bill, okay? (sighs) - Yeah, why not. - That's good, I don't have to feel as though I'm talking to the wall. - I don't get you! How could you be so calm? - Well, if I'm calm it's... I feel strongly that God is in control of the situation I'm in, he'll take care of me. - Goodie for you. - Hello, Mr. Kronholm please. Listen, I gotta talk to him now! - Gentlemen, the next thing on the agenda in our meeting is the matter of small business loans. This afternoon we want to consider the number of small business loan appli... - I'm sorry Mr. Kronholm, but there's someone who insists on talking to you on the telephone. I told him you were in conference, but he says it's urgent. - Excuse me gentlemen. - Gunnar Kronholm speaking. - We got your wife. Now get all the money you can and deliver it to a phone booth at 66th and Lindale. - Please, please, would you repeat the instructions? (low murmuring) Gentlemen, I have a problem. Eunice, my wife, has been kidnapped. Will you get Bob Anderson in here please? - [Man] Sure. - Bob, Eunice has been kidnapped. I've had a call from abductors. Call the operator and ask for the FBI. - Yes, give me the FBI please. - Dear God, how could you let this happen? We've tried. We've tried to serve you in all the areas where we've been given abilities in. We've been through so much heartaches before. Then you let me have Eunice. Dear Lord, how could you do this? How could you do this to me? - Get through? - Yeah. - What'd he say? - Well, I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - Well, I called him, like you said and I told him. I hung up, I got scared. I don't even know if he heard me. (grunts) - What's the matter with you, huh! I sent you out to make a simple phone call and you blow it! Idiot! (thuds) You think you could clean that up and make us a pot of coffee, hot shot? - Ah please, I need to go to the, I need to go to the bathroom. Somebody! I need to go to the bathroom, please! - I'm gonna pull you up. All right hold it, let me get the light. All right. Okay, please don't take off your blindfold. Just yell when you're done. - Yeah, all right. (door knocks) - Eunice, you want to stay alive, you don't touch the scarf, you understand? - I told her that. - And don't take all day! Did you at least remember to bring some beer? - Yeah it's in the car. - Thank you. - [Eunice] I'm done. I'm done! - Come on. All right, over here. - [Man] Bryan, turn off the set. - Mom, I have something to tell you. - Yeah, so that's connective. - Well mom, it's something about Eunie. Eunie's been kidnapped. - No. Kidnapped. - Listen, I called the other fellow Bill so I don't feel like I'm talking to a wall. What would you like me to call you? - You can call me Jerry if you want. - Okay, Jerry. - Hot shot, go get drunk. Hey Eunice, guess what I just heard over the radio? That there's cops all over the place. One of them's been shot! - Oh dear Lord, how did that ever happen? Why do they do things like that? - Don't get all excited huh? - How did it happen? - I don't know. One our guys must have ran a red light and a cop probably stopped him and he got excited and shot him! - Was he hurt badly? - They don't know yet. - Oh, that's terrible, terrible. - Would you like a beer, Eunice? (low murmuring) - Jan, thank you for this. My father, please bless this. Oh God, dear, dear God. I beg of you, keep her safe, keep her well. Don't let her flu get worse. God my father, don't let those men torture her. May we hear soon. Let contact be made. May the demands be such that we can meet them. Amen. - Uh, it's only instant, but well it's coffee anyway. - Oh, I thought I smelled coffee. - Be careful, it's hot. - Thank you. Oh that's good. You know, I was wondering, what ever happened to my car? - We took care of it. You should get a new car out of it. - You mean, you wrecked it? - No, I mean once the FBI'll through with it, well they'll pry open the trunk... - And there won't be much left after that. - I don't understand you. I mean, you're not nervous. I'm a wreck and you're just as calm as you can be. - Well, it isn't myself. I'd be very upset if I weren't a Christian. You know, many years ago I found out who God really is and what he wants to do for people, for me. He wanted happiness for me more than I wanted it for myself. And all he asks is that I allow him to control my life. He wanted me to believe that he loved me so much that he sent his son, the Lord Jesus, so show us how to live and love other people. In fact, he loved us so much that he allowed his son to die for our sins. Now all we have to do is accept that fact and ask God forgive us our sins and take over our lives and make us into the kinds of people he wants us to be. - Sounds easy. - Oh, it is, it is. That's why it's for anybody. Oh God, work in his heart. Even through this, may he come to know you. Well, why don't you tell me about yourself. You married? - No but I was. I'm not now, though. - I see. - Okay gang, it's nap time. (gasps) - What are we doing? - Well, thanks to you, we're gonna spend the night right here. Give me a beer. Hey, hey, hey, that's mine. - What about me? - Get your own blanket. - Get your own beer. (laughs) - That kid's got guts. Pleasant dreams, Eunice. - Gentlemen, we've come into this case on the assumption that it is a kidnapping. Gunnar received a phone call from someone saying they had Eunice and to collect as much money as he could and deliver it to a station. The rest of it was unintelligible. - All I ask is the safe return of my wife and the FBI has promised not to interfere. We are waiting further instructions. We will meet their demands and we will follow instructions. Eunice, I love you. And we're all offering prayers for you. (cries) (slow somber music) - Hey Eunice! Eunice, rise and shine. Hey, come on, come on. Look, I'm gonna let you take the scarf off and go into the bathroom and wash up, okay? Come on, get up. But look, when you're through, I'm gonna put a different blindfold on you. But look, while you're in there, do me a favor will ya and don't look around, okay? All right, let me know when you're through. All right, don't take all day, huh? - [Eunice] All right. - [Man] Come on Eunice, hurry up. - All right. (door knocks) - [Man] Come on! - All right. - All right, shut your eyes tight and don't look. Right here, right here. I'm gonna put the new blindfold on you. Just relax. Okay, how's that huh? A lot better than the scarf, huh? Good girl, that's a girl. We can go sit down now. - When they call, you should be prepared to meet their demands at once. - I intend to. I'll go myself, of course. - It has risk. - Yes. - We would recommend that you allow one of our men to take care of it. Our men are trained to react. - But Clay, she's my wife. I'm willing to take the risk. I have no right to ask you or anyone else to endanger yourselves doing what I should do. - Gunnar, it's not only the risk. - But Clay, remember she is my wife. - Gunnar, it's just not safe. Now, we have an agent here on duty, Dick Donovan. He's very close to your build and similar in height. We think he'd be a good double for you. Gunnar, why don't you think about it. - All right. - Why don't we talk a little bit, huh Jerry? You're not from around here are you? - No, I'm from the south. - From the south. Tell me about it, about your family. What about your mother? - Well, I don't know, she's too good for my dad, I guess. He was drunk all the time and get pretty mean when he got drunk. - I think you better tell me some of the points of your life I'd be expected to know. - All right, where shall I begin? - Tell me about Eunice's background. - You mean where she grew up and went to school? - Yes, but father back than that. - You know, I've never met a woman like you before though. I mean, most women be crying and hollering they'd be so scared, but you're not. I'm sure glad you're not. - I can't take the credit for that. I told you why that is, Jerry. - Yeah. - [Gunnar] Did I tell you Eunice is the youngest? - Of seven children. - You know, I had a very good mother too. She's still living. - Yeah, mom used to get along real well. We used to do a lot of stuff. We used to go down and get shrimp right out of the water. We lived on the Gulf. Boy, it sure was good. I wish I had some now. - I bet. - All right, we gotta move. The owner's been nosing around. I don't know if he's hip yet, but he's gonna be back in a couple of minutes. Grab her stuff, we gotta go. Come on Eunice, we're going bye bye. Right this way. - My purse. - Come on. Yeah, we got it, let's go. (dramatic music) Get her coat. Come on, move it. (dramatic music) Hate to do this to you, we'll put you in the trunk. - Please don't, please don't. I'll die! I could get carbon monoxide in there! I'm a mother, don't, don't! - Just for a little while. We gotta make a phone call. Come on, just for... - Please don't do this. - [Man] Just be quiet for a little while. - Please it's not that bad in there. I rode around in it myself for a while. It's safe. There's plenty air, you won't smother. - I'll die! Oh please, will you take of out soon? - Yeah, don't worry. About 10 minutes or so, don't worry. - Don't leave me, don't! Please don't leave me! (thuds) (dramatic funky music) (phone clacking) (phone rings) - Kronholm residence. No, I'm sorry, there's been no more news about Eunice. - What's the matter? - It's busy, I'm gonna try again. - I'm sorry, but we have to keep this line open on orders of the FBI. - Hang up, Greg. - No, there's nothing more we can tell you. We've got to keep this line open. - Hang up, hang up. - Come on. All right, copy this number down, will you? Come on, come on! - All right, all right. - 483, 483. - I'm sorry. We've just got to keep that line open. (funky music) - Give me a dime. - I don't have any more, I used them all. - Hello. Just one second please. Ruth! For you. - Hello? - Yeah, yeah, is this Ruth? - Yes, who's this? - This is a friend of Eunice's, Eunie's. Yeah, can you get a hold of Gunnar? - Yes, I think so. - Okay, now you tell him to be at your house in exactly half an hour. We'll call back then. And remember, no, remember no police, no guns, no nothing, okay? Hey, I get it, I get it. - Hurry Gunnar, they're on the phone again. They say they can't wait! - Oh did they? Thank you. Gunnar Kronholm speaking. - Hey Gunnar. Are the police with you? - How's my wife? - No, no, no, hey listen, don't worry. Eunice is fine. Naturally, she's a little scared, you understand? But otherwise, she's all right. Listen, don't worry huh. You just follow instructions carefully and everything's gonna be all right. - I'll do everything you say, but how do I know that you have my wife? I'm going to ask you a test question to make sure I'm dealing with the right person. - Well, go ahead, ask it. We'll give you the answer the next time we talk to you. All right, now you listen to me, you go to a phone booth on 66th, west of Lindale in Minneapolis. You be there at eight o'clock and we'll give you further instructions then. - It's 7:20 now. - All right, now what's the big test question, huh? - The question, ask Eunice, ask my wife, what we did in going to the opera... (loud rock music) - Okay, what you did? - After the opera, our last night in Rome. - In Rome, okay. Now listen to me Gunnar and you listen good. I don't want no police, no guns, no nothing, you understand? Okay. (loud rock music) What's the matter with you, I'm trying listen on the phone! - I didn't know. - Vick, God keep you. - Okay hot shot, you wanted something to do, ask her about Rome. - Mrs. Kronholm! Your husband wants to know if you're okay! - [Eunice] Tell him I'm okay! I'm okay. - We did, but he wants us to ask you a test question so that he knows you're all right. - [Eunice] What is it? What is the test question? - What did you do the last night in Rome that was special? - [Eunice] We went to the opera! - Yeah, yeah, we know that. What else did you do? - [Eunice] We went out for pizza! - Pizza. That must be it. (laughs) - You're gettin' good. (phone rings) - Gunnar Kronholm. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're late Gunnar Kronholm. - What did my wife say about Rome? - Yeah, she said you went out for pizza after the opera. - When can I talk to her? - Nevermind about that, huh. Remember, no police, no guns. - No, no, of course not. - All right, now you follow these instructions and you follow them carefully, you understand me? - Listen, I'll do whatever you say. - You go to the Hub shopping center. There's a phone booth located at the corner of 66th and Nicolette, okay. You follow them and nobody's gonna get hurt, understand? Now get going. We know how long it's gonna take you to get there. (dramatic music) You make the call. I'll tell you when he gets to the booth. (dramatic music) Okay, he's at the booth, go ahead. (phone rings) - Kronholm here. - All right, now open your jacket and unbutton your shirt and whatever you got on and walk outside the booth. Hold it all back, to prove that you're not wearing a radio mike or something like that. - Okay, he's clean. - Okay, we want $400,000 in fives, tens and 20s. - That's impossible. The vault is closed. The most I can get is 200,000. - Wait a minute, just a minute. They can't get $400,000, they can only get two 'cause the banks are closed. Come on, please, let's take the $200,000. I don't want to keep this going. I just want to get it over with, all right? - All right, all right. - All right, we'll take the two. Now listen, this is what you do. Get the money and be back there at 6:30 tomorrow night. No tricks, no tricks. Just do everything like you're supposed to and you'll get your wife back. Come on, let's go. (low ominous music) (doors clattering) I told you, she's almost frozen. (ominous music) (clattering) - Oh, how did it go? - They called it off. - What do you mean they called it off? - What went wrong? - They were very suspicious. I'm supposed to meet them at the same place at 6:30 tonight. - Oh no! - They wanted $400,000. They told me what denominations. I told them the most we could raise was two. - Did she say anything while you were alone? - What's she gonna say? She wants to go home. So do I. - Can't stay here all night, you know. - Where we gonna go? - We gotta move early. I got us a room at the motel. - We gonna sleep at all? - It's up to you. You want to sleep, sleep. - Mrs. Kronholm, Mrs. Kronholm? You gotta wake up, we gotta move. (funky music) - [Man] Okay. All right come on, slide on big boy. Come on. - [Eunice] Where are we? - Step up. Just sit. (bell rings) - No, no. You can't go near that door. You stay right here. What do you want? - I'm here for Bryan's paper bag. (radio music plays) - We got a radio here, would you like to listen to it? - Yeah I would, I sure would. - Anything special? I mean, I don't know the radio stations around here. - CCO, try CCO, that's 83. - Is that it? (twangy music) Maybe you ought to do it yourself. You know, I just don't know. Here, right here. (gospel music) - [Eunice] Do you mind if I listen to this? - No, not at all, go ahead. (gospel music) - [Man] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, all that is within me, bless his Holy Name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all thine inequities, how healith all my diseases. All believers are part of his family. He is our father, we trust that you are aware that your heavenly father is watching over you this day. Let us pray together. For some of us, our human circumstances are most difficult but Christ is here to help. We pray for those in deep waters. Lord, we ask that you will give them courage and hope. As we are here or as we have gathered by a radio, we acknowledge we need your strength, as we move through life. We pray that from us... - Can I get you anything? - [Man] That will make people hunger and thirst for righteousness. (gospel music) - I forget you're such a big boy now. - Would anyone like any more? (phone rings) - It was Eric. - Would anyone like some more chicken? - More lemonade. - [Man] You've been hearing reports about the abduction of Eunice Kronholm. We'd like to urge all KTIS listeners to pray that God will intervene so that Mrs. Kronholm will soon be reunited with her loved ones. - Did you hear that? Thousands of people are praying for me. Isn't that something? - I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. - [Woman] I don't think we have any coffee for dinner. - [Woman] Well, it's time now. - [Woman] I always like a little coffee after dinner. - [Woman] I know, we'll enjoy it now. - [Woman] Should I cut some big pieces or little pieces? Do you think the men are hungry already? (soft instrumental music) I cut some big ones for the boys, they're always hunger. Bryan is growing so fast. You know, I remember one time when you and Eunie were little girls and you had... You want a piece of cake? Sure, you take the napkin. Oh, it's not so big, but it's good enough. You better be careful. You'll get fat like your grandma. - You know, when I get outta here, when I get my share of the money, I'm gonna give a lot of it to good causes. - That's good, Jerry. Do you have any particular ones in mind? - No, well, I haven't given that much thought yet. - Hey gang! Chow time, huh! You deserve a break today. - You know what we heard on the radio? Thousands of people are praying for Mrs. Kronholm. - Oh yeah? That's terrific. Praying for the wrong one. Hey Eunice listen, I want you to start thinking about you should write in the note to your husband. You could say anything you want. Then I got something I want you to write. (sighs) - Lord, you know I love Eunice. I thank you for giving her to me and for all she means to me. Lord Jesus, it's in your hands completely. Your will must be done. Whatever happens now, it'll be as you planned it. Thank you Jesus. (clattering) (machine dinging) (phone rings) - Kronholm here. - Hey Gunnar. Nice talking to you again. Listen, you go to the phone booth on Portland and 78th. Open the directory to Kronholm. You'll find your instructions there. - I've got it! - Yeah, it's a pay station on the corner of 76 and Portland. Right. - I'm to put the money in the trunk, leave the key in the trunk. I have a list of instructions as to where to go. (ominous instrumental music) (dramatic music) - [Man] Eagle one, making his motion with package in trunk. We'll keep him sight at all times and keep you advised of our 20. First destination is the wharf. Lincoln as been advised to leave key in the trunk and wait 15 minutes. (dramatic music) This is eagle one, Lincoln is approaching the wharf. Keeping the package under surveillance. (low dramatic music) - Small coffee. (ominous music) - [Man] This is eagle one, package was not picked up. Lincoln is moving downtown to second destination, the wheel. (ominous music) (soft country music) - [Woman] Evening, how are you tonight? - Ginger ale. (dramatic music) - [Man] This is eagle one. We have some trouble here. An unauthorized TV car is interfering. We're taking it out. Radio silence will be maintained to protect the package. (sirens blaring) (dramatic music) (sirens blaring) (phone clattering) (phone rings) - Gunnar Kronholm speaking. - Now look, I want to know what's going on here. There are cops all over the place! Now I thought we had a deal! - We do, we do. Somebody must have misunderstood. What should I do now? - Well, what about the cops? - I can lose them. I don't know what they're doing. - Now listen, if there are any cops around the deal is off, do you understand? - Look, I know I can lose them. - All right, okay now this is your last chance. There's a McDonald's hamburger stand on highway 13, west of 35W. Now you go there and you wait for me to give you another call, you understand? And no tricks this time, no cops! (dramatic music) (phone clattering) (phone rings) - Gunnar Kronholm speaking. - All right, now listen to me. Take the money out of the trunk and put it up in the front seat with you, all right. Now, drive south on 35W. - Wait, wait! - All right, drive south on 35W till you get to Frontage Road. Now, take Frontage Road and you'll come to an old metal bridge all right. Now take the money and drop it at the edge of the bridge and then just get outta there. - What about my wife? When do I get her back? - Look, if you do your part of the bargain, you'll get her back at daybreak. - Where, how? - Just don't mess around and you'll get her back at daybreak! (dramatic music) (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) - Well? - You should have your wife back soon. - Thank God! What did they say? - They said they'd release her at day break. We'd better get over to your place as quickly as possible. I'll tell you about it on the way. - I'm ready. - You get on the floor of the backseat this time. - I'm so tired. - I know. - I don't care what happens anymore. - I know, I know. Bill, Bill let Jesus handle your life. You know, the bible says love even those who persecute you. Bill, I care about you, I really care about you. Give your life to Jesus. He'll give you a new life, Bill. (Bill cries) - Don't preach to me. (sobs) - Gunnar? - Yes? - Why don't you get some rest. There's nothing we can do till morning. - You're right, thank you Dick. (horn blares) - Eunice, Eunice wake up. Come on, we gotta move. Everything go all right? - Yeah, it went fine. - Did you get it? - I got it. - Does that mean I can go home again? I can go home now? - Oh yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it Eunice. - [Eunice] Oh thank God. - [Man] Step up. - Hey my friend, take Mrs. Kronholm to the living room. - All right, this way. - Hey come back in here, I want to talk to you. - [Man] Yeah. - We did it huh? - Yeah. - Listen, I got to leave you for a while okay. A few things I gotta pick up. - All right. - If I don't come back, get rid of her. So long hot shot. (laughs) - Jerry. - Yeah. - Jerry, I thought you left me. - Had to go out to the garage for a minute. - Jerry, I asked God to get me home by six o'clock tonight. Do you think I'll get home by six o'clock tonight? - I sure hope so. - What, what? - I bought something this morning, a radio, a real nice one. I thought maybe you'd like to listen to it. I'll turn it on. - Yes. - Just tune it that way and whatever station you want. - Oh, I got it. (soft instrumental music) - [Man] Now a news bulletin on the Kronholm kidnapping. Police have picked up a suspect they think was involved in the abduction of Eunice Kronholm last Friday morning. - Jerry! Jerry, did you hear that? Jerry, Jerry, they picked someone up. The radio says they picked up someone they think was involved in the kidnapping. You think it was Bill? - [Man] Here's an update on the news bulletin on the Kronholm case. The suspect has been identified as Fred Watson. The FBI said that Watson had been under surveillance and that they felt it was best to take him into custody at this time. Mrs. Kronholm is still missing, although the ransom was paid last night. - Oh man! Oh man. What am I gonna do? Why'd I ever let myself get into this mess! How am I gonna get out? (dramatic music) I'm sorry, I'm sorry we put you through all this. I didn't like it, I didn't like it from the beginning. I don't know what to do, I can't decide. I gotta go and think, I gotta go sit down and think. (cans clattering) - Jerry? I don't think it'll do us any good to be here together. - I know. I know it, they're gonna be coming around here any minute, I know that too. I just don't know what to do, that's all! - Why don't you let me go now, Jerry? - I'd like to. I'd like to get out of this whole mess myself. - Then why don't you? - I don't know! They got me either way. - Then, I think you oughta let me go right now, Jerry. - No, no, wait, I mean... Well, they're working over there. I don't want them to see you. Maybe we oughta wait 20 minutes. - Well, I'll just get on my coat and boots while I'm waiting. - Still working over there. (phone rings) - Kronholm residence. No, no, nothing yet. - You might as well take off the blind fold. Don't make no difference anymore anyway. Here's your blanket. There's a Superette down the road about a mile on the right. - Well, I'm gonna go now, Jerry. - [Jerry] Maybe I oughta go with you. - Oh no, no, that would be a mistake. Be less conspicuous if we go alone. - [Jerry] Yeah, I guess so. - Jerry remember this, I forgive you and God loves you. (soft instrumental music) (dramatic music) Oh God send me... Oh!

They'll have her in a matter of minutes. Craig, call that store back and get her back on the line. Tell her I'll have someone there to pick her up in a few minutes. I'll call the office. - Calm down, Gunnar. Everything's gonna be all right now. It's fine. - Miss! There's a telephone call for you. - Oh Gunnar! - Mrs. Kronholm, your husband gave me the telephone. I'm Clay Brady with the FBI. Let me assure you, Mrs. Kronholm, that no one can get there faster than one of our men. - Mrs. Kronholm? FBI, Trimbaugh. - Oh they're here! Wait, Joseph Trimbaugh, yes! - We'll take you to your husband. - All right. (Eunice cries) - It's all right, Mrs. Kronholm, come on. - The FBI's picked her up. She's fine, Gunnar. She'll be here in a little while. - Dad, she made it. - Yes, Craig. - Look, we've prayed often these four days. God's been very present. He's answered our prayers and we should pause and thank him for it. Lord, thank you for protecting Eunice. Thank you for guiding Clay in his endeavors and for giving Gunnar the strength to see this through. - Thank you God. Thank you my father. Thank you for bringing Eunice back to me. (soft instrumental music) - Hello, I'm Gunnar Kronholm and what you've just witnessed is what happened to us in March of 1974. Let me introduce to you, my lovely wife, Eunice. - God has said that he would work all things to giveth for good, to them that loved him and those that are called according to his purpose and he has done that through this incident, and particularly in the life of Jerry, the man that I call Jerry, who was one of the kidnappers. Not long ago, I received a letter from Jerry, who is in prison, apologizing for the terrible crime that he had committed upon me and my family. He also said that he had found God again and he felt surely, that God had forgiven him but needed our forgiveness in order to make him a complete person again. You know, God is really a great God and he still performs miracles and for the thousands and thousands of you that prayed for a miracle for us, I want to thank you. (soft instrumental music)
