Now. What's happening? Please! No! No! No! Please! No! That's not Mussolini. No, no. ll Duce is not here anymore. He left this morning with colonel. He's not here now. I swear to God. Look, signorina, you better put some clothes on. This village is gonna be full of partisans in a minute... ...and they'll be looking for information or something. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Winston Spencer Churchill. Good morning, major. The general's expecting you. Thank you. Now then, Major Wright. -Let me tell you what l got in mind. -Suppose I said no? Did I hear you right, major? Come on, Sam. I've taken two dozen men on two missions. Except for a couple of them, they're all dead. Yes, and most of them would have been hung by now anyway. A few of them would still be alive. Mister, you refuse an order, you face court-martial. Court-martial finds you guilty and you'll finish the war in a military prison. Half the officers in the European theatre... ...think you belong there anyway. Well, maybe they're right. That's a nice sketch, general. Your work? -Well, yes. -That's a beautiful sketch, general. It's my rendering of a secret German document I saw last week. -Do you know what it is? -V2 rocket? A much more powerful version than that. When the Germans make that baby operational... ...it can reach New York, Washington, Moscow. It's an A4 missile. The Germans were working on something like this in the mid-'30s. If they made it operational in time for this war... ...they probably would have won it already. Well, I'll pass that along to the Allied General Staff. Supposing I'd painted a picture of a missile landing in Washington... ...and what the results would be if it were crammed full of poison gas? -The Germans will never use gas, sir. -Hitler's desperate. He's gotta find a means of achieving a quick victory. One that'll knock the Americans and the British out... ...and give him a chance to wipe out the Russians. I'm not gonna explain Allied grand strategy to you... ...except that there are three dozen canisters... ...of an experimental but deadly nerve gas in a monastery in France. We want them taken out... ...before they can be launched by those new rockets. Now. -Use the Air Force. -No, we can't. There are six scientists, top experts in chemical warfare... ...brought in from the occupied countries. We want them rescued from that monastery. You'll bring them out of France. No, you got the wrong man, general. You know, I'm not on any rescue mission. Get the phone number of the International Red Cross. Right now, mister, you're on your way to Forbes Road military prison again. My idea is that you start finding another Dirty Dozen. Of course, that may not be your idea at all. -Well, I was thinking-- -Nothing further at this time, major. Yes, sir. Got Joseph Stern here, major. Death by hanging. lnteresting record, Stern. I mean, brief, but interesting. For what you want done, major, I qualify. Oh, there's no doubt about that. Let's see, born in Germany, came to the United States in 1935. ln '37 went back to Europe. Spain. Fought on the Loyalist side when you were only 17 years old? I lied about my age. Three armed robberies back in the United States. No convictions. A federal rap, gun running. And you beat that one too. Yeah, I've been running in luck. Yeah, well, your luck ran out. They finally nailed you. Drunk in a bar and killed an Englishman. You want to hang for that? -No. -All right. Let's see, you speak German, you handle a weapon. You know, my problem is I gotta put a team together. And according to this, you never played on any team except your own. Look, major, this isn't a baseball game you're talking about. You're talking about war. You want to go all the way to Berlin and back. lf it's the only way I can beat the noose... ...I'll follow you. Just for the record... ...I wasn't drunk in that bar. -All right, open up. -Okay, Swede. Bring out the bucket. Eric Wallen, death by hanging. They going to hang me now? No, no, no, not now. Maybe later, but not now. -How long you been in solitary? -I'm not sure. He's been in solitary 25 days, major. And what did they send you to solitary for, Swede? They tried to kill me. He refused a routine diphtheria inoculation, major. The doctor ordered it... ...and he put the doctor and three MPs in the hospital. That's an impressive performance. Let's see, you killed two British citizens to get here in the first place. They try to kill you too? They tried to take my money. Oh, that's the last bad idea they ever had. According to the medical examiner's report... ...you crushed their heads with your bare hands? I'm sorry about that now. How'd you like to get out of solitary, Swede? -They're going to hang me, sir. -Probably. But maybe not. Would you like one last crack at the Germans first? Could you tell me your name, sir? Major Wright. And you remember that, soldier! Because from here on in... ...I don't think there's anyone else who will be all that important to you. I brought you together tonight for a number of reasons. One of them is to view some secret footage... ...made available to British lntelligence... ...by sources inside Germany. Lights, please. The locale of this film is a small hospital... ...maintained by SS experimental units near Schierling. Our information is that this film was shown to Adolf Hitler... ...and his production genius, Reichsminister Albert Speer... ...less than two months ago. She is being given a small dosage of a new nerve gas... ...developed by scientists working in France under SS control. More gas is pumped into the room. By now, her lungs are collapsed by the gas. Her heart has slowed. Her brain is paralyzed. And she's dead. Lights, please. Sam, how much time do you think we have... ...before the Germans start using this stuff? Not much. British Intelligence is convinced... ...that canisters of this gas can shortly be delivered... ...to every part of the British lsles by V2 rocket... ...without the loss of a single German life. Think about it, gentlemen. All that for my benefit, general? You have to be kidding. Did it work? More or less. You know, I'm not that fond of the Army... ...but after watching those Nazi training films... ...I realize I hate those bastards even more. The Abbey of St. Francis of St. Michel. That's where it's at. The sacristy, SS quarters. The scientists are being held in the old monk's quarters... ...and the canisters are in the wine cellar. Your orders, major. You will take 12 general prisoners... ... convicted and sentenced to death or to long terms of imprisonment. You will train and qualify the prisoners... ...and deliver them secretly behind the lines. You will attack and destroy your assigned target... ...and you will free the six captive scientists. Any breach of security, any failure of discipline... ...and the prisoners go right back where they came from... ... for summary execution of sentence. Ferruci, Ernesto. Twenty years hard labour. Might add a little class to the act. Okay, Pops, on your feet. All right, at ease, Ferruci. Sorry to disturb your labours. No problem, major. I got 20 years to finish it. Well, if you-- -How old are you? -Forty-four. -Come again? -Forty-eight? Well, the Kansas City police department... ...got you listed here for 52. Oh, l thought the Army might be good for... ...my security in my old age. So I lied to the recruiting officer. -Yeah, what's that? -I write poetry. -Do you? -Yes. At that little tent of blue Which prisoners call the sky That's a good piece of jailhouse poetry. -Thank you, major. -Thank you, major. lt was a great piece of jailhouse poetry when Oscar Wilde wrote it... ...fifty years ago in Reading Jail. Oscar Wilde? I thought it sounded kind of familiar. You really had it made, didn't you, Ernesto? With your phoney gas coupons, food stamps... ...counterfeit British pounds. You're a one-man black market. Sometimes a man gets desperate, major. I met this English girl. She was 25 years younger than myself. -I lost my head. -It's a good thing she wasn't twins. We would've lost the war. I don't know, Ferruci. You're a con man and a thief. But where I'm going, they don't just give you 20 years. They turn you upside down and let your guts roll out. No. I think you're a little too old for this project. l'm not too old, major. l'm in good shape. Maybe I can help you with some of the young kids. Honest to God, major. I don't want to die behind these walls. Okay, now, you listen. You foul up one time and you die in France. You understand? Now, I don't know what I'm gonna need. French ration books, food stamps... ...German identification cards, occupation passports, currency. But whatever I need, I need fast. And I need it perfect. You got it, sir. Never con a con man, Pops. This is Webber, Ronald and David. Thirty years imprisonment. Each. Well, I thought I'd talk to you two boys together. -Since you're partners in everything. -I always try to look after Davie. Oh, you're the one. Well, look what happened to little brother Davie. You got him 30 years and you're still taking care of Davie. -Ronnie's tried to talk me out of things. -Obviously not enough, right? You start off as race car drivers, and you wind up as what? Auto thieves and killers. Let me ask you something. Do they give gold cups for that kind of dumb? All right, relax. What's the last good year, boys? '39, major. We left the farm, went up to the Indy with a 3.2 Maserati. Man, we almost took it all. And then what happened? You run out of gas? Not exactly. We lost the farm the next year, major. One thing after another, everything went down the drain. Let me ask you something. You boys, you sprechen Sie Deutsch? You mean German? I hardly heard it since Daddy pulled up stakes and took off years ago. All right, you look German. Put a uniform on you... ...keep your mouths shut and then what happens? People gonna think you stepped out of the Afrika Korps. Is that why you're picking us, major? I'm picking you because you're drivers. One slowdown and I'll run right over you. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. You are now entering maximum security, major. I see. One.... You keep three empty cells between Fontenac and the others? Right, major. The idea is to prevent the others... ...from getting to him before we hang him. Well, I really picked some beauties this time, huh? I'm sure the major knows what he's doing. I hope you're right, sergeant. Simmons! You move an eyelash and I'll blow your head off. You can scratch him off the list, major. And we'll hang him for escape. Don't touch him. He's perfect. Yeah! Lunge! Lunge! Left parry! Right parry! Left parry! Best you got, Martinez? -Lunge! -Come on. -Left parry! -Come on. -Let's do it. -Right parry! -I got you. -Lunge. Right parry. -Come on. -I can't hear you. Now lunge. All right, recover. Recover. I'm surprised. I mean, most of you are in here for capital offences, right? It looks like the only thing you've ever killed is time. Put that on. So, what are you gonna do when the Krauts show up? Read them your trial transcripts? You, Swede. Catch. Hold onto it, it won't bite. I'm the enemy. It's you and me. Go ahead, lunge. Major, I'll kill you. There have been two great wars. Sweden has managed to stay out of both. World War I and World War II. I wonder why. Is it because you're a peace-loving, intelligent people? -Or is it because you're cowards? -Major, don't. -Don't push me. -I'm pushing you, Swede... ...because I want to find out where you're coming from, all right? Now, are you a soldier... -...or are you a coward? -Kill him, Swede. -Come on, Swede. -Stick him, Swede. -Put him away, Swede. -Get him, Swede. Major, cut it out! They want to know. Are you a man or a gutless punk? Lunge. What happens when the Kraut comes along... ...and shoves this steel through to the back of your head? That's enough for this session. Okay, okay, let's go. Line up. -Move it. -All right. Everybody out of the trucks. Fall in. Move it! And when you're ready... ...count off. -One. -Two. -Three. -Four. -Five. -Six. -Seven. -Eight. -Nine. -Ten. -Eleven. -Twelve. -Thirteen. -There'll be only 12 of you... ...going on the mission. So be on your toes. One will go back to prison. The infiltration under the live ammunition course... ...is usually reserved for the last week of training. But the first week and the last week... ...are one and the same around here. And besides, I want a fast rundown on you people under fire. The 30-caliber machine gun at the other end of the field... ...is locked in to fire at 36 inches above the ground. That's three feet. Listen carefully. Keep your heads down. And you keep your butts close to the ground. Then you should get through it easily. But if you panic... ...then this mission is all over for you. All right, hit the ground. Two at a time! I can't do this. -I gotta do something. -You keep going, Hallet. -Or he'll get us all. -No. Hallet, keep going. Stay down! What are you doing? Hallet. Cease fire! Goddamn it. He's dead. Now it's an even dozen, major. You just used up your spare. Get back on your bellies. You're only halfway there. Commence fire. Take it slow, little brother. It ain't like the major to leave trucks sitting here. I'm telling you, it was the same last night. You boys couldn't sleep, huh? We're going out. You're gonna send me back to hang? Not unless you want to come along with us. Yeah, sure, Swede, we got room for one more. Don't forget... ...if one of us fouls up... ...we all get it in the neck. Swede, you gotta think about yourself. That's just what I'm doing. You go back to the bunks. You didn't have to get mad, Swede. Like I said... ...you boys go back to the bunks. Now. Gee, Swede, I never want to be around when you lose your temper. Congratulations. You got as far as survival school. These shells... ...contain two ounces of nerve gas. It's odourless, fast and deadly. Our mission is to destroy a monastery... ...that may be crammed to the roof with canisters of this stuff. You didn't tell us about this. Now, you've been given preliminary instructions... ...as regards the use of the gas mask. When that weapon is fired, you get that mask on in three seconds flat... ...or we'll be burying some of you. Ready, fire! Get him in the air! Get him breathing again! Put him down. Come on, come on, you'll make it! He didn't know what the hell to do with that mask. But now the rest of you do. You didn't have to kill Ferruci to make your point, major. Oh, well, all right, so I lied. The gas in those shells... ...aside from rendering the victim temporarily unconscious... ...has no lasting effect. You can rejoin your buddies, Ferruci. Welcome to World War II. Welcome back, Mark. -How was London? -A little chilly this month. Good to see you again, Paul. Let's get rid of this, then we're on our way. Everything is going according to our plans, Paul. A selected group of Americans is already in training. Have you seen Flamands again? Yes, and they are eager to go... ...with one exception. But there are terrible problems now. -What are you talking about? -Halt! Hold fire. Is this the man you saw talking with your distinguished project director? Yes, colonel, I'm sure of it. Carl. I want increased protection for the abbey. I want increased vigilance over all air traffic in this province... ...especially single aircraft. Notify the Sicherheitsdienst. Yes, sir. Well, now. They're beginning to look like soldiers. If you don't mind, I won't tell them you said that, general. Yeah, sure. I wouldn't want to hurt their feelings. I'm sending them to jump school next week and-- Forget jump school, major. That's the principal reason I'm here. There isn't gonna be any dramatic parachuting into occupied France. What are you saying? These men have-- The British agent who jumped into France was captured... ...and executed by the SS... ...along with the French Resistance leader who met him. There's been a leak somewhere. You mean the mission is cancelled? No, the mission is not cancelled. But the Germans are monitoring every flight into the St. Michel area. And they've increased a detachment of SS at the abbey. They know something. We just don't know how much. So you'll go by sea. You'll get the exact coordinates later today. And the code name of the French Resistance leader... ...who'll meet you and get you into the monastery is '' Marie.'' -Marie? -That's right. Her father was the leader that the SS blew away. That's the best we can do. You want to send them back to hang? Come on, Chacon. -All right! -Come on, Chacon. -Go, come on. -Yeah. -Go, go, go. -Yeah. -Go, go, go. -Move over. Move over. I got a gal in New Orleans Sixteen kids and a can of beans Five-feet-seven and eyes of green But she's ugly and she's mean -Sound off -One, two -Hit it again -Three, four -Cadence count -One, two, three, four One, two, three, four I got a gal in New Orleans Sixteen kids and a can of beans Five-feet-seven and eyes of green The target area. The Abbey of St. Francis of St. Michel. A very holy place, I would imagine. Yes, it was a holy place, Kelly. The monks have been sent to another monastery of the same order. This monastery is in the hands of the SS Totenk opf... ...the Death's Head Division. The Resistance has pinpointed three main areas for us. The radio room to knock out communications... ...the wine cellars with the gas canisters... ...and the machine gun post on the balcony. The travelling members of the order... ...are still permitted to use the chapel. And that's where you come into it, Ferruci. Yeah? What do you need, major? These are identification cards... ...issued by the SS commandant of the St. Michel area. A Colonel Krieger. I want two of these for the brothers of the order... ...authorizing them to travel for two weeks. -It's sure nice to be working again. -Oh, that's nice. And make sure the documents identify me... ...and Maurice here. Are you saying, major, that you and I are gonna go into that monastery? Eventually. There are 36 canisters in the cellar of the monastery. We're gonna blow them up... ...and get out the six scientists they're holding as prisoners. We're going in there to bring back six scientists? You told us we were... -...gonna get a shot at the Germans. -Relax, Stern, that'll happen. And I got news for you... ...they're gonna get a good shot at us too. Martinez, that safe you blew up in London, a piece of cake... ...compared to knocking out those canisters at the monastery. I never did a job like this. But maybe I can do this one. Oh, well, if you do... ...and everything goes right... ...then you're gonna beat the Army... ...out of 50 years in military prison. How's that? -What about the juice? -The juice. -The French will supply the explosives. -Let me ask you something, major. You say we're going to blow up the canisters of poison gas. Won't the explosions spread the gas? Well, the best thinking is, that if we use incendiaries... ...and the canisters are in a tightly enclosed area... ...as they are in the cellar of the abbey... ...the gas, in its present inactive state, will be consumed by the flames. Suppose the best thinking is wrong? Then... ...none of us will ever get to play the violin again. Well, I thank you for your attention. All right. What do you think, sergeant? I think they're gonna bury you in France, major. They think the same thing. Everybody out. Move it. Let's go, let's go. Move it, guys. You heard the major. -What the hell is this? -Don't look like a jump school to me. No, this is some kind of port. Southampton maybe. Maybe we're gonna get our shots here. Look at that. Oh, that's nice. Hey, sarge, she got a sister? All right, inside. Move. Move it. -Come on, move it, Pops. -Don't call me Pops. Now, Pops, don't get overexcited. Well, here they are. Good-looking men. It's a transatlantic invasion! -Hello, dear. -She's gotta be dreaming. -Come here, sit next to me. -Think I died and went to heaven. I'll have the big tall fellow. Greedy. All right, this is Martha. Martha's the head mistress of this... ...very exclusive girl school. Martha says you're part of a very elite unit... ...just like our commandos. Yeah. That's us. An elite unit. One in a million. I like the slow dance numbers. I prefer the fast ones, Yank, but it's your party. Easy does it, Yank, I'm on your side. He's a rapist and he murdered a WAC. -You think he belongs here? -You all belong here. But do me a favour. Keep an eye on him anyway. Consider it done. -Got any cigs? -Yeah, chewing gum too. Finally found something they like to do. What do you think will happen when the brass finds out, major? Forget about the brass. I'm getting these guys killed. The least I can do... ...is let them get lucky. The sea is full On the French coast The light Gleams and is gone Welcome to France. I am Marie Verlaine. I'm Major Wright. Maybe we ought to keep moving. This way. I'm sorry about your father. -Was he betrayed? -Of course. I haven't been home since. But there's a farm where we'll be safe until we hit the monastery. You been in touch with the scientists? The project director, George Flamands, is waiting to see you... ...but there's something you should know. Two weeks ago, the SS Commandant Colonel Krieger... ...decided the scientists at the abbey needed better motivation... ...for their work. -What are you talking about? -Three of the scientists are married. He rounded up their wives. Are they in a concentration camp? On the contrary, they are at the monastery. The 'honoured guests' of the Third Reich. I didn't come to pick up husbands and wives. I know why you're here, major. To blow up the monastery and kill the Germans working there. I approve of that motive. Why can't we stay on the land until we reach this farm? Krieger has doubled the security at every checkpoint... ...adding regular troops to the SS. The Germans are so used to controlling the river... ...that they've gotten careless. All right, Marie. Let's go for it. All right, I'm counting on you to take out the radio. Get down! Where's Sturdivant? He's dead. Stern, get on the radio. Familiarize yourself with the vessel's call letters... ...but don't attempt any transmission. You got it. Let's get this craft cleaned up. We're going up the estuary. First class. And make contact with the Resistance. -Good evening, Marie. -Good evening, François. They are here now. We made it. -Very good. -Yes. Hey, this is just like home. The one I ran away from. Major, how come we can't drink some of this fine French wine? Because I don't want a dozen winos on my hands, that's why. Now listen. You're all gonna stay down here until 21 30 hours. The Resistance people are gonna post guards... -...but you all stay out of sight. -Where are the French girls, major? -They did us a fine job in England. -Yeah. Well, I just wanted you to know what you were fighting for. -Fontenac! -Major? We're going to the monastery. Marie's arranged a meeting with the director of the project. George Flamands. -What happened? -We're not sure, colonel. The boat was last in communication at Salles-sur-Mer... ...about 5 p.m. yesterday evening. lt was to patrol the estuary and the approaches until 1 900 hours. lt was found with no signs of life at the estuary about 20 minutes ago. -What about the crew? -Gone. There are many bullet holes on the forward and afterdecks. Notify Army Group 7 headquarters. Yes, sir. A commando attack, colonel? No. For what purpose? The boat was taken for a purpose. And when that purpose was accomplished... ...the boat was abandoned. We're lucky we found it this fast. -What about the reserve ammunition? -Expended or perhaps stolen. We thought perhaps the local Resistance. The local Resistance doesn't smoke Lucky Strikes. -Major? -Come in. I'm sorry to disturb you... ...but I'm going to see some of the men who went into the city today. All right. You go to St. Michel, find out what's happening. -In the meantime, I'll brief my men. -Good. Marie... ...is it gonna be difficult to leave France and your family? My mother died when I was a child... ...and my brother was killed in the first days of the war. Now that my father is gone... ...the only family I have is the Resistance. I'm sorry. You really must know what war is all about, right, Marie? Beautiful. Yes, but take a good look. Now, remember, you're a monk, okay? You've taken vows of piety and non-violence. You fake it good, or we're dead. Morning, holy Fathers. -I see you've come from Nimes. -Yes, the new home of our order. But we have a great desire to pray here, if we may. Oh, of course, are we the enemies of God? Did you come by Nancy? No, by way of Châlon. It's much faster, and the scenery is much more pleasant. My impression exactly. Thank you, holy Father. You did a good job with the sentry. Thank you. I was an altar boy. Of course. I should have guessed. Suppose your project director doesn't show up? No, he'll be here. Look, when we leave... ...you tell the SS sergeant we want to return again. Tonight. Could be evening prayer. Very important for monks. Perfect. Good afternoon, brothers. I think you have come a very long way. In search of God. That's a journey we all must make. Monsieur Flamands, we're taking you out of here tonight. Good. I'll start collecting my notes... ...and advising the other members of my group. Except, of course, for my assistant director, Pierre Claudel. -And why not him? -He's a French Nazi. Part of Vichy, part of the Croix de Feu. He may have caused the death of Paul Verlaine... ...the local Resistance leader. Major. -That man could blow this thing open. -He doesn't know. If he knew more, he would have denounced us already. The plan. We come here after midnight. We blow up our target... ...and get you out in less than 20 minutes. That's possible. But you must get us out of the monastery before you blow it up. -We'll do that. -You'll have plenty of time... ...to make sure your wives are safe and kiss them goodbye. -What are you talking about? -Monsieur Flamands. We didn't know about your families when we landed. This is a military evacuation. We've got a problem. We just don't have any room. Then it's impossible. Don't you realize what would happen to my wife... ...and other hostages... ...the Nazis could think of to threaten us with? Why else do you think we worked for them? Perhaps because of your interest in pure science. I will be missed at my desk. Make no mistake, I'm going nowhere without my wife. We will be ready in any case. Pierre. I had no idea there was a religious streak in you, George. Colonel Krieger is on the phone. Thank you. All right. Now the Resistance will have two trucks in back of the abbey. How about a tour bus and a guide for these husbands and wives? Major, it is crazy to go bring them out. Suppose the plane won't take off? Oh, it will take off. Besides, the flight's not that long. And if we have to, we'll jettison some of the reserve fuel. You said half the German air force in France is in this area. You gonna outrun them with these people? Yes, if I have to. Look... ...the scientists won't leave without their wives... ...and it's my job to get them out of here. No, major. Your job is to knock out that monastery... ...and to keep scientists from showing the Germans... ...how to make more effective poison gas. What the hell are you talking about? Give them a choice, major. The same choice the Army gave us. You go or you stay. Now if these people don't buy it, we'll stop them. Not only from making more gas... ...but also from setting up another laboratory... ...to replace the one that we're about to blow up. You're talking about murdering them. We are in a war, major. They have a choice. You wanna leave it up to these boys here? -To vote on this? -Maybe Fontenac's right, major. Let them have a choice. They're the brains the Nazis need. No, he's wrong! And I'm not leaving here without them. -Yes, Marie, what is it? -Some men must go get the trucks. Others must get back to their families. The SS is conducting house-to-house searches in St. Michel. Well, the Germans must have discovered the patrol boat. Or they know it's missing. But they have other duties which may help us. The new army general has arrived to command the region. There is a reception tonight for him at the villa. And the reception will tie up the top brass, huh? All right. We finally got a break. If they're entertaining the general... ...maybe security won't be as tough at the abbey tonight. Maybe. Claudel was here a moment ago. -He says we have to get dressed. -That's right. The new German commandant wants to see us tonight. We are to be his guests at dinner. You said the Americans are coming to take us out. I know, but I can't contact the American officer leading the attack. I don't know what his reaction would be if I did. Especially if I told him everything. Did you tell him about us? He knows that there are wives. He doesn't know more than that. Then you and I must go with Claudel. That damn Nazi. -A kiss, Papa. -But of course, my son. Mother says you're going out. Yes, we have to go into St. Michel for a few hours. Just your mother and I. Sorry. You said we had to be ready tonight. That's right, my son. And you may have to go somewhere without us for a while. -Just a while. -You mean like the school? Yes, like the school. No matter what happens, you stay with your friends and Dr. Dufresne. -Is that clear? -We're all soldiers now? So young to be a soldier. My people will get you into the wine cellar of the abbey. We leave at 10 tonight. Good luck, major. All right, I'll lay out that plan later. Martinez. I couldn't help overhearing some of the conversation. If there is a problem in taking me... ...I can head south, and then try for Spain. Marie, I'll get you out of here. What do you want, major? You trying to find out... ...who's on your side if there's a showdown? I can tell you. No one. -What about you, Stern? -I came here to kill Germans. Okay. You know, I did a little checking into your record... -...while you were training. -You should mind your own business. Those three banks you robbed... ...all branches of Trans-German Nord. The largest German-owned trading bank in New York. Maybe I didn't know that. Maybe not. Or those guns you were arrested for smuggling. All wound up in countries... ...fighting against the Germans and the Japanese... ...even before we got into it. -I told you.... -No. You haven't told me a damn thing, but I'm telling you. Whatever you got up there... ...it's tearing you apart. What difference does it make? We're all going to be dead in a few hours. Stern isn't my real name. It's the name of the family... ...I was smuggled out of Germany to live with. Well, is your real name important? No. Most of the people who had it are probably already dead. There were literally dozens of us, major. Maybe I'm the last one. So those six scientists working for the Nazis... ...whether they live or die, you don't give a damn. You got it, major. I'm sorry. So am I. Lieutenant Karl Hoeffler. He commanded the patrol boat, colonel. Any other sailors' bodies recovered yet? No, but we know the area where the attack must have taken place... ...and we will continue searching. He died for his Fűhrer. How many Resistance members do we have in detention? Six, colonel. Hang them. Orders of Reichsleiter Himmler. Post a notice of retaliation. State that they are being executed in reprisal... ...for the murder of German sailors. State that I may spare the six if those who actually committed the murders... ...are identified. Marie and the partisans will meet us at the north end of the monastery. Martinez, you and Stern take out the canisters. Holt... ...you wipe out the gun tower, then get inside... ...and blow the place to hell. Maybe I can do this one. Ballews and Chacon will go and support you... ...from the upper balconies. You got 20 minutes to secure the monastery. Hey, Pops. Where's Fontenac? He said he was gonna pull guard duty. That lying bastard. Come on! You move and I'll cut your throat out. Get the major. After I get rid of this pig. No! You don't make that decision. The major does. I'll be right back. Oh, you're beautiful, Maurice. You're a real work of art. What the hell happened? Is there anything I can do to help? Get them out of here. You don't know who these men are, do you? Of course I do. They're a picked unit, right? Elite troops come all the way... -...from America to save France. -No, no. Suppose I told you that a few weeks ago... ...these men were in a military prison. -Most of them sentenced to hang. -What are you talking about? It's true, Marie. These men were picked for this mission, not because they're ''elite.'' Because they're expendable. Not because the United States Army is proud of them, no. They're thieves and killers. Then what are you? Well... ...I'm the officer who picks them... ...trains them... ...leads them into action, and more often than not... ...most of them are killed doing the job. Marie. I can't kill Fontenac now even if I wanted to. I need him to get back into the monastery. To launch the attack. But for this mission, Marie... ...you're even more important. Call me when you're ready. When it's over... ...I kill Fontenac myself. Shouldn't my father and mother be back now? You must be patient, Fredric. Try to be calm. When we get inside, I'll take care of the Communications Room. You go to the rear of the building... ...and make sure that Martinez and the others get in with the explosives. Whatever you say, major. It's late, Fathers. It is not too late, I hope, sergeant. I'm sure God is still awake. Go, Stern. The plane from England will touch down in 90 minutes. I guess we'll be on our way home by midnight, right? You got it. I was curious as to how a monk... ...living in isolation recognizes the insignia of an SS sergeant. Thinking of taking a little stroll, Maurice? I can get us into Spain. Want to come along? Go through that door and I'll blow you to hell. All right, come on. Come on, Kelly, let's get inside. No! Pops? Swede, help Pops. What happened? The chemicals must've affected the incendiaries. They exploded. -Where are the wives? -On the other side of the cellars. Martinez, you go upstairs and make sure nothing's moving. Kelly, Stern. You come with me. Let's go. What--? Who are these children? They were brought here when their schools closed this week. Supposedly as a bonus, but of course they are hostages. The whole damn German army will be here in a minute. What are we gonna do with them? Let's go. The new German commander invited Flamands and his wife to his villa. We have to leave without Flamands. You can't. He knows more about Z-1 7 than the rest of us put together. If the Nazis have him... ...they can put back everything you have destroyed in a matter of weeks. We can't get the whole group out of here, major. Let's take the scientists and leave the others. Are you crazy? They just executed six hostages in St. Michel tonight... ...because you killed those sailors and no one in the whole Resistance... ...would give you up to the Nazis. Why didn't you tell me they'd taken hostages? What could it change? But the wives and children will go to the concentration camps... -...if we leave them behind. -You're right. We're getting them all out. Now get these people to the trucks and onto the plane. Stern, you and I are going to the villa. If we're not back within the hour, take off. Now, that's an order. That uniform's not a bad fit. Well, I used the lron Cross to cover one of the bullet holes. Fourth row, third from the left. Give him a couple of minutes, get him out of here. You got it. -Yes, what is it? -Colonel, Sicherheitsdienst just... ...passed on information that a Fieseler 1 68 was spotted over... ...Charlėne-Sur-Mer about 10 minutes ago and preparing to land. Counterintelligence informs us... ...there are no authorized flights in that area at this time. Do you know the coordinates? -Mark them on the map. -He saw two trucks leave... ...and take the Soissons Road less than 15 minutes ago, colonel. All right, give me the map. The rendezvous will be in this general area then. But they can't have gotten there yet. I want a blocking force of vehicles and men at the Soissons Road. Here. Pull them from the SS pool area in North St. Michel. Yes, sir. I want those damn trucks stopped. Don't you realize my wife is still in there... ...and there are more than a dozen German officers in the building? The rest of your family and colleagues are on their way out of France. Well, a monk in the afternoon, and a captain in the German army at night. What a transformation. You shoot and you're dead in seconds. This has nothing to do with you, Pierre. You are a Frenchman-- Yes, I'm a Frenchman and I'm loyal to Marshal Pėtain and the French state... ...not some degenerate traitor who-- Hold it! Hold it! Open it. Open up! Let's get on to the airfield! What's this coming? Hold it. What the hell is this? I'm Sergeant Holt for Major Wright. We have the cargo, or most of it. -Where's your major? -He'll be along. Oh, I doubt it. -He's in St. Michel. Dead. -What's he talking about? Major Wright and one of our men went to St. Michel... ...to bring out the project director and his wife. He sent two trucks along the Soissons Road... ...because he thought the SS would have a report that you'd be in the area. He sent the rest of us along a side road that ran along the estuary. I want to wait for my mother and father. -Wait for them in the plane, kid. -The kid can wait with me. -It's all right. -I suppose I'm better off not asking... ...where the women and children came from. -We're already due out of here. -We're not gonna leave... ...until the major and the trucks arrive. Kelly! Set up the 30-caliber. I want you to guard all the approaches. They're not coming, sergeant. They're dead on the Soissons Road or St. Michel. -Fontenac's right. -Set up that gun, Kelly! You're blowing our last chance to get out of here alive. -Nice of you to drop in. -Good to see you, major. Can we go? No. I've sent four men and two trucks out to decoy the SS away... ...from the others, and they're unaccounted-for. Mama. Doesn't look like they're gonna make it. -Move out! -Mama. Fredric! Fredric! I guess I won't be going home with you, sir. After them! What sort of unit is it that you command, major? Top secret, boys. Elite troops. You must be proud of them. You'll never know how proud.
