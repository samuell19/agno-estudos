David Mamet said that? That's amazing. - "Galaxy Quest" is the story of a group of actors who were on a sci-fi television series real similar to the original "Star Trek." - By Grabthar's Hammer we live to tell the tale. - And they get kidnapped, brought into space by a group of aliens who have studied their TV show as if it was an actual recording of real life events. - Since we first received transmission of your historical documents, we have studied every facet of your missions and strategies. - You've been watching the show? - Lieutenant, historical documents. - We really wanna believe that this stuff is real. We don't wanna believe that these are sets and Styrofoam and people pretending, and "Galaxy Quest" basically takes that fantasy and makes it writ large, and this is the true genius of "Galaxy Quest" is the fans have made it real. - It's such a charming idea because of "Star Trek" and because it's so beloved, was such a wonderful love letter to all those actors and all those fans. - It is a touchstone for filmmakers of a certain generation. - For me, what I remember most about it and what I love most about it is it didn't make fun of the fans, it really allowed you to have a sort of point of view in the story. This helped kind of usher in a generation of storytelling that both could keep the stakes, but also not take itself so so seriously. - Somebody does something first, and a small number of people go wow, that's amazing, and the larger culture ignores it; "Galaxy Quest" was way ahead of its time. - I don't know when it switched over to, it wasn't always this cult sort of favorite, and then it became that, and now it's huge. - That's because of the fans. - "Galaxy Quest" is actually a big part of my childhood. - Every aspect of it is just wonderful: the storytelling, the writing, the actors. - I thought it was funny. They portrayed cosplaying a little bit. - When I watched it when I was a little kid, I liked it so much, I thought, I was hoping they were gonna do a miniseries. - I was talking with a coworker about it today, we were quoting lines back and forth. - Someone goes, what? We go, oh, we had to stop what we're doing right now and go watch it. - I watch this movie several times a year. - Who hasn't seen "Galaxy Quest?" - And you can laugh and say, oh, that's me! - That whole meta take on it, analyzing "Star Trek" from the outside a little bit... - They weren't making fun of anybody, they were just, hey, don't take yourself so seriously. - We all embrace it together, it's just something we all love and experience together. - The really irony struck me when Tim forced me to go to a screening, and after the movie was over and I walked out and I sit down to have a Q and A, and they turn the lights up and the first three rows are people dressed in "Galaxy Quest" costumes, who either understood or didn't understand the irony of that. - I would make fun of people that would dress up and go to the openings of new movies. It wasn't cool, but yeah, it's never cool, it was never. But then it became okay to do it. - Only if it was the "Galaxy Quest" coming out. - Yeah. - It's one of those movies that you can watch again and again and again. - I was thinking, why do I like this so much? It's because the moment in a movie where he says, "stop, it's real," and the kid goes, "I knew it!" That was me, that was me, it's like, I knew it! - It's all real. I knew it, I knew it! - "Galaxy Quest" happened at this very unique period of time, because it was at this point where fans were still a little bit in the shadows. - You know, when I think of how people sort of behaved about fan culture in the late '90s, I think of the Shatner "Star Trek" skit on SNL. - Get a life! - Or he just says, you're a loser, you're a bunch of losers, and go home. - For crying out loud, it's just a TV show. - When "Star Trek" became really a hit, which was in Syndication in the early '70s, that's when the fans started calling themselves Trekkies, that's when you had the conventions, that's when you had people turn out in record numbers to these events. - That fandom started to coalesce over the course of the next decade and basically gave birth to "Star Trek: The Motion Picture," and then of course, "Next Generation" and the all the series that followed. I don't think that there has been a stretch of like, two or three years where there has been no Trek being produced, and that's only because of the fans. - People loved it so much that even when it was gone, they needed to still experience it. - Spoiler alert, I was on "Star Trek," and I meet people every week who are inspired by us. - You know what, we do these conventions, occasionally have young people come to my table and say, I could only relate to your character, it's overwhelming. - Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not here to ask a question, I'm here to state a fact how all of these wonderful people on stage right now changed our lives. Aw. - A lot of "Galaxy Quest" is the truth about "Star Trek" but it was said in a way that was whimsical, beautifully done, well-portrayed and non-offensive to anyone. - "Galaxy Quest" is without a doubt the best "Star Trek" movie, because it's about what makes "Star Trek" special. It's about the fans. - What I mainly felt watching the film, and I felt it all the way through, was, why didn't we do this? Why didn't we do this, it would have been us, and we would have gone through that same journey. We would have had such a big hit. - And the reason that "Galaxy Quest" earns its space inside the Trek canon is it really does feel like a Trek movie, because it has all the hallmarks of what makes a Trek movie work, which is never give up, never surrender, like, you can overcome sort of any problem. - We kept saying as we were making this, dude, it can't just be a comedy, it has to be a good "Star Trek" movie. One, two, three, action! - In the late '90s, Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen all come together, and they form Dreamworks, and they've got something to prove, right? These are three dudes who are at the top of their individual industries; ever other studio head wishes them well and tells them how much they want them to succeed and then roots for them to fail because that's the way the industry works. Dreamworks needs hits. Dreamworks and we, meaning our little production company, optioned a script by David Howard that had this concept, this idea of actors being mistaken by extra-terrestrials as not being actors but being, you know, the heroes that they appeared to be in the show. We really took to the idea and that it would be the basis of a terrific comedy. - It was sort of like that moment where you stop at the door and turn 'cause someone says something, and what if aliens that that William Shatner was real? I think that was the full thing. - Which was the premise, there was no other thing in the script that we held on to, and we met with many, many writers. They all came in with this idea that he hated being the captain, he was trapped in this role, and Bob Gordon came into my office and he said he loved being the captain, if he could be the captain again, it would be the greatest day of his life, and that simple adjustment changed everything. - I said, well, should I read the script? And they said, no, they didn't want me influenced by it. I sort of assumed some things about it, that there would be kind of a ship that they had to operate in a certain way, that each crew member would have their own thing that they had to now deal with in real life, and the moment that I really felt like that I could write it seems really super obvious now. It's when they have to admit that they are really just actors and they're not really heroes, and it all goes to hell, and when that clicked in, I said okay, I got it. I know, I sorta know, I know enough about it. - And then it was Bob who said, and he has to go into outer space, right? And we were like, what? What are you talking about? 'Cause we had it sort of like a, kind of a, you know, like a comedy of that era, like an Amblin comedy of that era where the aliens come to earth... - And I think that Bob Gordon did make it bigger than we thought it was going to be or than we thought we could afford. - It was Bob's brain that blew it out like that. - I think there were people who sort of were scratching their heads a little bit, like Mark Johnson was sort of like, this is a lot of explosions. - I would say in 1999, 2000, things were still kind of in their box; if it was a sci-fi movie, it was a sci-fi movie, if it was a drama, it was a drama. - In 1999, the vast majority of sci-fi movies were action movies, all of these dark, gritty, nihilistic sci-fi movies. - You could call it the end of the world. - I think that more than anything else, "Galaxy Quest" is sort of like an exercise in tone. - It is a broad comedy, of course, but it also has a real heart and real sincerity. - I would maintain that the studio never quite understood the tone of the movie, that they were expecting more an out-and-out comedy a la "Spaceballs." I can't breathe in this thing! - I'd never done a movie like this before, I'd never done a science fiction film, but they read it, and even though it still needed work, said okay, we're making this movie, so we started looking for a director right away, and that's when we came up with Harold. Harold Ramis is a big, he's just an imposing, big guy. And the one thing I will say is, having worked with a lot of directors, they're all different shapes and sizes, but the one thing they all have in common is they start talking and you go, yeah, yeah, I'm behind you. They're these natural born leaders. - Harold had a very, I mean particularly wry sense of humor, and I think that the notion is that was certainly gonna carry into the film. - Do you have any hobbies? - I collect spores, molds, and fungus. - He's one of the very few directors in 1999 that can get people into a theater. - We were like, wow, comedy genius, it's gonna be a great, funny film. The relationship that Dreamworks had with the Stan Winston Studio at the time was very, very fruitful. - It tells you a great deal about how much the studio cared about "Galaxy Quest" that they have Stan Winston do the practical makeup effects and they have Industrial Light and Magic do the visual effects. - I can't remember how many "Star Trek" movies, I worked on I think five total. When we are brought onto a project, there are very very high expectations. Dreamworks felt this was an important enough film to get an industry leader involved in it. They believed in the project. Immediately they knew that there were certain things they were gonna have to do, like design the Protector. And one of the interesting things about that, it's the only time in my career doing design where we had to have the Dreamworks lawyers involved with what we were doing, because they were so deathly afraid they were gonna get sued by Paramount, but one of our production assistants at ILM came up with idea, because we were having all this back and forth with the lawyers, the number should start off with NTE, which stands for Not the Enterprise, so we can stand up in a court of law and say, it is not the Enterprise, it says so right here. - The special effects in "Galaxy Quest," they hold up. When the Protector crashes, it's like, those effects are still really good. - I think that all of the visual effects people and all of the makeup effects people got a real kick out of the movie. - The visual effects were the straight man, in a way. - You really want to state to everybody at every phase, how can we make this as believable as possible? I know we're dealing with something that seems inconceivable but how can we make the audience feel like it's real? And that comes in the form of the kind of production team you put together to make the thing. - People saying, well this is a comedy, it's supposed to be campy, it's supposed to be sloppy, it's like, no. This has to be, these effects need to look real. - It's always a process and it's always an exploration, you know, you just do as many ideas as you can possibly do and kinda see what they gravitate to. - We started to come up with design elements for it, Linda Descenna was hired on as production designer. - I was a set decorator on "Star Trek: the Motion Picture" and "Blade Runner" and "Back to the Future II" and they called me up one day and said, we're doing this move "Galaxy Quest" and Harold Ramis is the director and we want him to meet you, he's in Chicago, can you fly to Chicago tomorrow and meet Harold? So we flew to Chicago, Charles and Mark and I, we met Harold. - Harold's sort of collaborating on that with the tone of, the look of the spaceship was going to be. - It was to be a kind of Star-Trekky-looking film, so that we were basing the design of the sets on that 1963, '67, really kind of cheesy, cheap, funny TV sets, and I thought it was gonna be a breeze. - The main thing they were going through at that time was casting. - Before we did anything, it was about finding Jason. There has to be a leading man, he has to be the protagonist of that TV show, but obviously they need to understand the comedy, they have to have a funny bone. - Harold had certain aspirations for who he wanted to cast in the film, and the studio had other thoughts. They sort of agreed on one particular actor, if they could get him, Harold would be very, very happy with him. - Who did he want? - Well, Kevin also would have been wonderful. - Kevin Kline? No, uh, eh... - Nope. - Possibly. - It's really interesting, 'cause the casting choices tell you where the executives are at. We want Kevin Kline in this movie, so you want somebody who's a slapstick comedic actor who's really good at embracing, like, over-the-top physical comedy. I love you, Harold Ramis, but you are all kinds of wrong about that. - We started building sets and we were fairly far down the line, and the actor declined, exactly right, he De-Kevin Kline'd, so. - The people I remember that we really talked about were Bruce Willis... - Bruce Willis, definitely not, definitely not. - Eh, no, Bruce Willis, bad choice. That's a bad choice! Tim Robbins. - I could see Tim Robbins. - He's too goofy, too boyish, maybe too boyish in the face, I don't know. Mel Gibson was in there too. - Take away Mel Gibson's side-of-the-road DUI Mel Gibson, let's just go back to 1999, a safer, simpler Mel Gibson. - And a lot of people that you would be surprised really pursued it and wanted to do it. - Alec Baldwin was desperate to do it. - He's got the look, he's got the energy, he's definitely got the comedic chops, or he now has the comedic chops, good choice. Actually a really good choice. - You know what, I've been watching this movie for 20 years. I can't imagine anyone else in those roles. - We offered it to a number of actors, it was offered to Steve Martin. - Also Bill Murray, Robin Williams... - And for one reason or another, they didn't want to do it. And the one actor who wanted to do it made it clear that he wanted to do it was Tim Allen. - Yes, I've framed it. Now I'll probably have to give it back, 'cause I stole it. I was a sci-fi junkie when I was a boy and I read pretty much everything that came out when I was a kid. There's freaks like me that collect every piece of that, I have one of the five Gorts here at my office, along with Robbie the Robot from "Forbidden Planet." It's very hard to do high-concept stuff that's meaningful. - Tim Allen's name came up very first from the studio, and Tim was a big star, had a number one TV show, he'd been in Toy Story, he'd had a book on the New York Times Bestseller List, I mean, he was a huge, big star. - I think it was Jeffrey Katzenberg who felt very strongly about Tim Allen, he loved Tim, he thought he'd be great in the role. - I don't know how to soften the story, it went, Jeffrey Katzenberg approached me, he said, we have this idea, and we sat down at lunch, and it was kinda funny, 'cause I'm digging into eggs and bacon, and Ramis was not eating, and I looked up, and so am I missing something here? And he goes, well we're just circling an idea and I'm not sure that this is right for you. And Katzenberg looked at Ramis and they kinda exchanged a look, and I said, so I don't have the part. And then the forks go down, and they're wiping, and wasted some bacon there, he goes no, 'cause we're looking at rather than a comedian to play an action hero, we're looking at an action hero that can play, to be funny. They're going, and I said, wow. And those two needed a minute, and I said, well yeah, definitely, this is a little uncomfortable. I'm not sure that that's exactly what he was saying, 'cause he had other comedians in mind. Harold said this to me. Harold had made "Club Paradise" with Robin Williams. There is no disputing that Robin Williams is hilarious and a big movie star and a big comic movie star. Harold thought that the failure was Harold's, that he didn't hear Robin's comic voice clearly enough. He was concerned that with Tim, who he met with a couple of times, that the same thing was gonna happen. - Next thing you know, Harold Ramis wasn't working on it anymore. - It was definitely a first for me to lose a director. I'd never been in that situation before, and I just adored Harold, but completely respected and understood why he departed the project. - He understood the Tim Allen casting idea, it wasn't like he was offended by it or anything, he just was like, there's a voice that's good for the movie, maybe, that's different than the voice that's good for me, and I get it. Anybody who knows Harold Ramis knows he didn't hate anybody, ever. He had a very clear sense of his own art. That was a sad day to lose Harold Ramis on a movie, because it's a big thing to get, yeah. - I mean, I think it would've changed the whole tone of the film, really. - 'Cause you know, "Groundhog Day" has like a certain vibe to it, it's very comedic, but in a dry comedic kind of way. - Harold Ramis has done great work, but I feel like no one else, any change to this would have been worse. - He left, and we were like, well now what're we gonna do? We kinda felt like, mm, it's not gonna pan out. - And you never know what's, there are so many pieces of the puzzle that switch and change, and you get excited about one, you know, manifestation of it, and then something changes, and it starts to kinda let the wind out of the sail a little bit as you move forward. - When I knew that Harold Ramis was leaving "Galaxy Quest," that it was going to signal, you know, probably put a big question mark in the minds of the studio. - You never want to lose momentum on a project and have it go away for some reason, so I think the challenge really was to keep the momentum going in a way that the studio felt comfortable, but at the same time, that we would be ready to start production. - Mark was a little stealthy, I have to admit. - So I wanted to make sure that we were well on the way and that we were casting and we were building sets and that this movie was gonna happen, come hell or high water. - We did meet with maybe eight directors, maybe ten, I mean but like, really quickly. - Dean read it and said to me, why don't you offer things like this to me? - Never. I haven't watched it in a long time. And it's not playing. - I'm basically a first time director, I've done one movie, and it did fine, it was all right, but I wasn't in the category of this movie, et, as a director. I would assume I became possible because it was falling apart and someone needed to come on. - Mark vouched for Dean, and I think that really made a difference. - Mark has been incredibly loyal, I mean, Mark discovered Vince Gilligan and stuck by Vince's work for 30 years to get "Breaking Bad" made. He's just one of those guys, who like, I like this guy's work, I like what this guy does, and you're in the Mark Johnson camp. - Now I know Dean well enough that when it came time for him to do it, when Harold left the movie and we gave it to Dean, he then had some second guessing. Well, let me reread it, and let me make sure it makes sense for me, and there were a couple of us, me at the forefront, basically said, no, you son of a bitch, you're doing it. - So then I got this call from Mark. If you say yes right now, I can get you on this movie. - Hi Bella, hi Lucas, hi Mommy. Look, this is what Daddy's doing. We're way out in the desert and there's lots of sand and lots of people and we're working to make a movie. Say hi Alan, my kids. - Hi, kids. This is what your wretched father has made me put on my head. - Ow! I think he understood the movie, he understood how to play it. - I grew up with two brothers, we all watched "Star Trek" when we were kids, I can watch "Star Trek" and be absolutely invested in it and still look at it as a ridiculous thing. - Commanding a star ship is your first, best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material. - I would not presume to debate you. That show, as a kid, it opened up so much possibility. - You can tell that the filmmakers love science fiction television. - It's very tricky to work on something that you have incredible reverence for. You have to start from a place of I love this thing, and the last thing I ever wanna do is screw it up, and to some degree, particularly as it relates to my work on "Star Trek" or J.J.'s work on "Star Trek" and "Star Wars," they are giving us hundreds of millions of dollars to produce our fan fic. Because when you talk about the fans, I just hear you talking to me. We're one of you. - And I think you have to love the kind of story and the world you're in, it's a thin line between a really successful fantasy action show and a farce. "Galaxy Quest" really was one of the first films and stories that celebrated the relationship that fans have with these kind of films or these kind of stories. - The first time I saw it, I went, uh-oh. Here we go, okay, I'm used to this, being made fun of, it happened when I was in high school, but then I went, wait a minute, that's not what this movie is. - By Grabthar's Hammer, by the sons of Warvan, I shall avenge you. - By Grabthar's Hammer... - Next. - The original movie they had was kinda goofy. It was real goofy, and everybody would have been goofier. That's how I looked at it. Dean Parisot came on and literally turned it on its ear. - No question about it, it would have been a very different film if Harold directed it, I don't know what the film would have been, it would have been, I'm sure, very entertaining, but that movie has a DNA of Dean Parisot. No question. Once thing to know is that Robert then did make other writing adjustments as the film progressed. - A lot of the stuff that I wrote for Harold was making it bigger, we sort of brought it back down after that. - I remember coming in on "Galaxy Quest." Once the director was changed and things were sort of a little chaotic, having there be some days that were really hard and very strange and very strained. - Dean was afraid of it being too spoof-y, so he was always double-checking us. - We did not want the movie, the set to look cheesy. We had somebody, and I won't mention her name, who kept on using that word, and we all resented it. - We were in the middle of building them, having them look like cheesy 1963, based on "Star Trek" the TV series. - That's not what it was supposed to be. - It kind of changed to look more like "Buck Rogers." We had to accommodate that, trying to stay within our budget with everything having been designed for a whole other look. - It does a wonderful job of creating what you expect from a late 70's TV show, but it all looks real. - I looked at it like, oh, I've got this great movie that's smart and absurd and has about 12 levels of irony to it and fandom and the whole the whole thing. - Dean always understood it, he understood it from the get. - Dean directed "Galaxy Quest" as a drama. - To tell any story well, you have to really believe in the characters, and you have to talk about them and write them and shoot them and cast them in a way that makes everything feel as real as possible, and it's the thing that allows us to connect. - Tim is not the obvious comedy choice, but Tim had in his life, the experiences that this character had. Tim had just had a major television show stop, and now he was sort of out there in the universe with just a "Santa Claus" movie, and that was it. I think Tim understood that world of protecting yourself from the fact that you might be a one-trick pony, right? That that might have been the only thing you ever did. I really related to this guy, this kind of a lonely guy, 'cause when he gets home, he lives alone in this creepy house up in the hills and he's drunk most of the time. - I think that he was the perfect cast, because he plays Buzz Lightyear, and Buzz Lightyear is nothing but full of himself. - I can see how they would be like, the guy from "Home Improvement" is, what? But he did great. - Oh yeah, he's phenomenal. - He's perfect. - He takes the very best of William Shatner as Captain Kirk and then he combines it, and I don't know if he even did this on purpose, with the very best of Patrick Stewart as a human being. Patrick was very much the leader of our set. And he would put his neck out for people, and he was our captain on-screen and off. - Like if you squint a little bit, he kinda looks like William Shatner, it's like, that is the perfect catch. - Phew, your commander is on deck. I have a T-shirt, had a big number one on it, but I get to act like that when I come in, your commander is on deck! It was just so much fun to rib these people, because no matter what they did, I am number one on the call sheet and number one in this movie, but it's not, I never believed that. - Tim was already on board and nobody else was. The hardest thing on this movie was casting it. Debbie Zane is fantastic at bringing in people. - Just people you wouldn't necessarily expect to see in those roles; it's the cast from Mount Olympus, it just couldn't be better. - I think that one of the things I would go to immediately that I love about the film is getting great, great actors to do something like that. And one of the things that really began, I think, to celebrate comic book films was when amazing talent decided that it was okay to do those things, that it wasn't gonna be career-ending. - Sigourney went crazy with her part. - My agent told me about it and he said, but I can't submit you, because they don't want anyone who's ever done any science fiction to be part of this movie. I don't understand that, I mean, it's we who have lived in science fiction who really understand what we're doing. - When I went to go see "Galaxy Quest," I was certainly aware of the fact that Sigourney Weaver was in the movie "Alien" but that she also had comedic chops. The fact that she's so different from Ripley, I think that if the character that she played on "Galaxy Quest" was Ripley-esque, it probably wouldn't have worked. - And once I'd read it, I thought, well I'm certainly as close if not closer to Gwen and Tawny as I am to Ellen Ripley. - I literally can't imagine anybody else in the part other than her. - Look, I have one job on - it's stupid, but I'm gonna do it, okay? - You cannot be an actress in Hollywood without having those Gwen and Tawny thoughts, you know, you can't be in that atmosphere where it is so much about what you look like without getting some of those insecurities. I guess in the end they relented, 'cause I forced my way in. - My "TV Guide" interview was six paragraphs about my boobs and how they fit into my suit. No one even bothered to ask me what I do on the show. - It's real important for everyone watching this to understand that this is before "Harry Potter." Alan Rickman is known as an incredibly serious actor. - For there is nothing lost that may be found. - Alan Rickman is who Bob wanted. It would be Laurence Olivier, you know what I mean, like that's what you want. - He's not a hard sell because everyone respects his work, he's a hard sell because initially they see it as broad. I'm now seen as impedimented because I'm not putting comedians in it. - I played Richard the Third. - Alan is unbelievable funny. It's a different way of looking at it. It's people that are funny because they've committed completely, and that's a hard thing, it's a difficult thing, 'cause not everybody's in that zone. - Loved the script, and we sat down with Dean and we chatted. - Tony, to me, is a silent comedian. - He's physically incredibly funny. Everything he does feels like Chaplin to me. It seemed that Tony was just made for this part, because this part was underwritten, I'm sorry Bob, it was kind of underwritten, so there was a lot more invention and a lot more physicality, a lot more behavior rather than dialogue. - Man, where the hell is he? And hour and a half late? An hour and a half. - Well, Darryl had been in "Home Fries" with me. The more irate he got, the funnier he was. - Damn man, come on, this ain't Radioshack, put the pickles on before you put on the onions. Three pickles, not four; this ain't pickle burger. - Shit, I was just imagining what could happen or what couldn't happen, and then I'm saying to myself, you know what, brothers don't go outer space too often. I've gotta talk to LeVar Burton, and he loves it. He loves the movie man, he was like, you know, it made him feel good, because he felt like he was as trailblazer. - If I remember correctly, I think because Dean wanted Daryl Mitchell so badly, and he was so much younger than the group, and it didn't make story sense that he would be so much younger, we had to come up with a reason for like, Corbin Bleu played him, and he was like this boy wonder, and then he went off to have a pretty huge career, it was almost like fly paper where all the right people just came, and then it was like, stuck, and then they all have big careers. It's a fun movie to kinda watch in the background, even people like, is that Rainn Wilson? - Sir, I am Lahnk, senior requisition officer. - "Galaxy Quest" was one of the very first auditions I did in LA, and actually my part was supposed to be a lot bigger, but I'd also gotten cast in the world's worst television pilot on NBC. - Yeah, yeah he did, he had to leave. Yeah, he would've gotten more, he was great. - Okay, nobody had heard of Sam Rockwell. - What's my last name? - It's uh, uh, I don't know. - Nobody knows! - My head turned the most was probably Sam Rockwell, I just said, this guy is brilliant. I did not wanna do the part originally. - He said no a million times and she just wouldn't let him. - Finally, I said yes to it, because I realized that it would come out probably around the same time as "The Green Mile." - The role in "Galaxy Quest" and "Green Mile" would be such a nice contrast, I can't explain why I would ever say no to this movie, it was just me taking myself way too seriously. - For me, it was my introduction to Sam Rockwell and how great Sam was as an actor and as a person. That's what I think of when I think of "Galaxy Quest." - Justin Long playing a role, that honestly, I think if you put him in it today, he would look like he's not aged a day. - Yeah, I was 20 at the time, 21. What's your name, son? - Brandon. - There was no question mark in the script. - It really was not a very big part, he was just so perfect, like that little crack in his voice. - Ah, I mean, that, Doc, that's from Michael J. Fox, who was my idol. Doc, are you tellin' me, you know, it was that! And Chris Farley, remember Chris Farley going, you're... - Evidently we had a little miscommunication regarding... he's so nervous, he just,. - I actually wanna, just wanted to tell you that I thought a lot about what you said... - There's also a comic book guy in there. I grew up watching "The Simpsons," and so he was always like best, you know, whenever he was talking to somebody was always a little bit down to them, I was like, I'm just gonna do what I love, I'm gonna steal from all the people that I love. - Justin's a very gifted actor and comedian and he's got a great ear. - I love Sam listening. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. - I've seen his impression of me, it's very, yes. It's slightly exaggerated. - Brandon, honey, garbage. - Ugh, mother I'm quite busy. - It's one of the best comedic cuts in the history of modern cinema is that they're trying to get in touch with Justin Long's character, and they're like, are you there, are you there? - Brandon! - And he's not answering, and you cut to him taking out the garbage. - Mother, I cannot stress enough the severity of the commander's predicament. - Don't forget the recyclables! - Oh he still is a teenager who has to take out the garbage. His mom does not care that the fate of all these people up in space depends on him. If you're a sports kid, which I suspect you aren't if you are watching this "Galaxy Quest" documentary, it's not enough to just be in the NBA, you have to win the championship in game seven with three seconds to go. For us, for us it's getting the call from Captain Kirk, and he's saying the Enterprise is in trouble and only you and your nerdy friends have the information required to get the Enterprise out of the situation it's in, can you help me, Damon? Like, that's the fantasy that we had. - There were all these suggestions thrown out, and one of them was to remove entirely the subplot of Justin Long's character, which is the very heart of the theme of the movie. There was a little friction. - I can't imagine what "Galaxy Quest" would be without Justin Long's character and his little buddies. And also, when you think about '99, the internet culture certainly exists, but the fact that there is a fandom and they all have different schematic areas of the Protector and they've got vid screens of each other up, this is like, way ahead of its time. - I don't think, for instance, you could do a film today about the teen nerd and say he was the outcast. Like, it wouldn't be true. But when I was growing up and I was the DM of my local Dungeons and Dragons group with a bunch of foreign exchange students it was a very different thing. Then "Galaxy Quest" came along and said, you know, these people are heroes too. They don't have to be the funny sidekick. They can actually be at the center of the story. - Brandon, where you goin' with all those fireworks? - Well, the Protector got super accelerated coming out of the black hole, we're gonna help Laredo guide it on the vox ultra-frequency carrier and use Roman candles for visual confirmation. - I do think that that's a lot more prominent now, that sort of self-awareness of one of the characters that really reflects the kind of people that might watch the show or see the movie. You could really draw a direct line all the way back to a film like "Galaxy Quest." - And it's a terrific character arc, where they go from being a punchline to being heroes, and it mirrors very much the journey of the characters who are on the "Galaxy Quest" show in the movie. - In the end, it's the fans that actually bring the plot together and actually save the universe. - If you didn't have that, then you wouldn't have "Galaxy Quest." - And one of the things that I really like is that there's a hero within all of us. - Fans in "Galaxy Quest" are not just the people who are attending the convention or Justin Long and his buddies, the Thermians are the fans in "Galaxy Quest," they just don't realize that they're fans of a television show, but they literally say that this television show changed their culture, they credit this television show almost with religious awe. - At ease. - I'm a geeky nerd or a nerdy geek, take your pic. - La la la! - Real fandom is about creating this illusion that in some way this piece of popular fiction may in fact be real. - I have always felt that cosplay is the purest, most wonderful expression of love. - We love this show, we need this show, we want this show to be real, and you need us. The reason that there is a convention is because of us. - We relate so well to the Thermians. So naive about things, in fact, why do we have to be so crass when we get to be adults? Why can't we all just stay kids and just, things are what they are, and we don't know that, you know, lies, deception, yes. - Deception, lies. - It started out with two of us because I made two costumes. - If you look really close, our costumes aren't awesome. - They're not professional quality, I sew my own costume, but I put those uniforms on and then I'm not me anymore, so. - In this role, we are the Thermians from Utah. Yes. - It's perfect that they're octopuses, because an octopus is real sensitive and really smart and very willing to sacrifice itself to preserve its children, and it's one of the reasons I have an octopus tattoo, so when they are revealed to be octopuses, I'm not saying that I get a little bit of tear in the corner of my eye, but I'm not not saying that. - We thought, that's a really unique, crazy out-there, they're kinda funny, but they're kind of, like, no one's ever seen octopus people in a long time. When they were done actually about three weeks before they were needed to shoot, and I got a phone call from Stan in his car one day, and he goes, are you sitting down? I go, no. He goes, maybe you should go sit down. I go, why? He goes, Steven saw the test footage and he thinks they're too ugly. He'd like them to be like, "Close Encounters" aliens. I was like, but they're done. Yeah. - They're done, they shoot in three weeks. - I like the octopus better. - The octopus, quality. - Ultimately it came back that, okay, leave them as is. So there was a fleeting moment where those were almost cut from the movie, and that would have been really tragic I think. - Mm-hm, yeah, totally. - Hey, Fred, oh that's not right, no! - It's not right though! - Oh, that's not right, yeah, that is not right. - I had some very generic line in there. Same is so respectful and comes up and says, you know, I was thinking of playing this this way, and I was thinking of playing this this way. - Did I really? - Yeah. - Phew, wow, that's great, I'm glad I did that. - I'm not exaggerating, we were making it up as we went along. - Obviously I wasn't there when Dean Parisot was shooting the movie, but my sense of the film is that at every step of the way, it was a little bit like jazz, so they know kind of what the story is that they're telling, but they have to take those risks, and still all of that feeling like a single orchestral thing. It wasn't so well-planned as you might expect. - Dean, he was like the great enabler of choices. The bigger, the weirder, it was all good. - You have to play it completely for real, including Enrico and setting the tone for the aliens. - He auditioned, and it was good, but it wasn't what I was looking for, and he got up to go, he was like, he was tentative, there was something on his mind, I said, what what what? He goes, well I had this voice I was trying. Oh, what is it, what is it? And that was the voice. - There was a vocal exercise that I was taught at the Yale School of Drama, and it was just hitting all the resonators, touching all your, you know, head, there's seven different resonators, so... - I must speak to you, it is a matter of supreme importance; we are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula and we need your help. - And as soon as he did it, I went, that's genius. As I started casting other people, we all started trying to duplicate the voice. - Debbie Zane was like, I don't normally do this, but I'm gonna show you someone's audition. 'Cause I'd looked at the sides and I wasn't really sure, and then, so his audition was, hello, you know like that, and I was like, oh I know what this is. - Is that what happened? - He basically invented that whole thing. - I didn't know I had the job yet, so I'm glad I found this out after the fact. If I'd known that, oh, we would have negotiated a much bigger, better deal. - As we had alien school every day, they started growing and getting more fun and more interesting and having their own particular quirks and traits. - And then just a little one at the end. Yeah. - The part that made me laugh unexpectedly when I first saw it, I thought they're gonna take me out of the theater, was the limo scene where he's looking at her and everything, it's like, what, she doesn't speak? - Her translator is broken. I can't even... Don't hurt yourself. - And then once the ball was rolling, they're all so brilliant, they just kept taking it and inventing more. - It had said that they were like Disneyland employees and they didn't know what lies were. Patrick came up with the walking with the hands and the legs together. - They just got it slightly wrong. - They watched, but they just didn't... - Right, and I got that from "Thunderball XL 5" 'cause they were marionettes, and we destroyed every extra on that show, because they all had to get that hammered in anytime they were walking behind the camera they all had to be like... - And sometimes if you were really watching, you'd see an extra that's just like, uh, I don't know what I'm doing, I'm just kind of like... They came in, it was the longest day, because no matter what we did, once they knew that we were laughing at it, they never stopped with that. - We were all kinda looking at each other going, maybe we're just having too much fun. We shouldn't be having this much fun. - They found every joke, they found every exciting moment, they had every great line you could possibly have, no one can explain lightning in a bottle in the business. - It became what it was going to be, there wasn't anybody stomping on it. - What you always wanna do when you're making a movie for a studio, you want the studio to be making a movie other than yours that's either really expensive or very high-profile or going dramatically over budget so all of their attention is on that movie. - The studio was making another movie at the time, this movie "Gladiator," which is a fantastic movie, and it was shooting in Malta. The actor Oliver Reed died also while they were shooting. So the most tragic thing that could happen on a movie happened on that other movie that was shooting at the same time we did, so you know, they weren't really paying that much attention to us. - There was no adult supervision, or very little. - The sets melted. - No no, there was a literal fire. - And I wanted to shoot anamorphic; anamorphic, without getting too tactical, requires a lot of light. The only thing Steven Spielberg ever sort of advised us to do is to put down shiny Mylar to make the floors have some life, 'cause you're trying to get some life into everything, and this was a little bit of a dead set. So we put down all this Mylar everywhere and turned the lights on and it all buckles like that, like, the whole floor buckles. - Never leave the set. - "Galaxy Quest" is very unique in that there are three formats in the film. When it starts out, it's kind of the square television format that we're all familiar with. Very small, letterboxed on the screen, and then it grows, and then it becomes 1.85, which is kind of the real world, where we're at the convention, we know we've gone from one world to another, but there's a second change in the format that a lot of people don't pick up on. - When the doors open, when he realizes he's on the deck of the spaceship, the doors open us up into widescreen CinemaScope. That's why I shot it in anamorphic, so I could have this giant widescreen. - When the doors get to the side of the 1.85 aspect ratio, they open it up to 2.35 and it was symbolic of him having his eyes opened to what was really happening and the rest of the film is in 2.35. It's pretty subtle, though. - If you don't tell the projectionist in the theater that that's happening, then he opens it up for 1.85, and all of a sudden, that great big effect is in the curtains on the side, which is really not good, and that happened, apparently, in hundreds of theaters, it was the stupidest idea. And then they started sending out, I guess, little notes on the cans, you know, but yeah, great, great idea. - I mean, I think one of the amazing things about great movies is that ultimately everything happened exactly the way it was supposed to. - We didn't know what this was gonna be. It was so eclectic, the group of people we had. - One of the things that helps is when you go on location, people become closer, because they're not dealing with their regular lives, they're out in some weird place, and we were in a very strange location. - One of the things that was very unique was to be able to shoot in Goblin Valley in Utah. It's a national monument, it's protected by the government, and Dean immediately responded to that, so we flew out from Los Angeles. And this is where we are, we're in the middle of nowhere. There's no stoplights, there's no anything, it's completely empty, just a lot of sand and dirt and rocks. We were all getting along pretty well, we had a lot of fun there, we had some good parties in Goblin Valley, and it was hot and people were in latex suits and it was hard, but we had a good time. - This is a horrible MacGuffin to that movie. - That shirt comes off on the desert, and the way it's written, I'm the rest of the movie with no shirt, and I said, you know what Dean, if you read this script, when do I get my shirt back on? And he goes, I don't know what to do about that. Well, I'm not gonna do the rest of this movie, I don't mind a couple of aesthetic scenes, grease me up or whatever you gotta do to make me look manly, but I'm not gonna do it, so that shirt just magically shows up on the control room. Yes, 'cause it got beamed up with him. - Shatner was kind of built at that time, and it was supposed to be, at least that part, you wanted to believe that he was an action hero. So I had a trainer, and I ate, I think, cat food most of the time, 'cause I had to stay at this weight. - You know that Tim's experience with his personal trainer on the film? - Yes, course I do. - That's Janie, his wife now, so she worked out with him, he had a gym there and he would work all the time with Janie, and she's now his wife. - Tim would tell me every day that we were going straight to video; actually, nobody tried harder than he did secretly without pretending like he wasn't. Cut, cut rehearsal. - The entire group of them sort of became like a, they were all working off one another, and they were all working together. - I think they work well together as an ensemble, the Thermians are fantastic... - You can see the chemistry, they had fun doing the movie and you can see that. - That's my star moment in that movie, man. Pulling that spaceship out that dock. Somebody was going ee-ee-ee! Yeah, I'm doing this so yeah, they're all reacting to me making the noise of that ship, kind of exhausting after a while. And we just can't get it out. Ee-ee it was terribly funny. - We had the loveliest group of people in this movie, and you can tell that Dean created this atmosphere where we could thrive and we could also be very vulnerable, we could, you know, we didn't have our shells on, we didn't have our armor on, and he allowed that to happen. - Sigourney had been taken so seriously in her parts. She couldn't wait to get into costume. And she had these big fake breasts that she kept throwing at us, she wouldn't take off the blonde wig. I did, I hated to take it off. Sometimes I'd even wear it home. Part of it was I wanted to find out if blondes really do have more fun. - All systems are working commander. - I guess for me, there but for the grace of God go I, I could've gotten on a series and that would have been what happened to me, I was probably acting out something I'd felt very strongly in my career that I never had a chance to express, honestly. - You often have a collection of actors that come from completely different study of the craft. You'll have a very method actor like Sam Rockwell, a sort of Sandy Meisner-style, who's probably closer to Tony, Tim would come to the set usually a little bit late and make vomiting and farting noises. Alan would come five minutes early, would know everybody's lines, and you could look at him in the corner going, ugh. - I think just to say that Tim Allen and Alan Rickman exist in the same movie together and they're gonna play the Kirk and Spock avatars, that shouldn't work. Like, they shouldn't exist tonally in the same universe, and yet they do. - Alan thought I was such an asshole because I'm doing cock, ball, fart jokes right up to camera. - I remember Alan telling me that in the beginning, I don't think he really knew who Tim was. Sort of looking at him maybe slightly askance. - Tim, if he had one person paying attention to his jokes, that was it. If he just had, it was usually Chill and me just like, laughing at everything he said. - They called action like two minutes ago, and me and him is over there acting up. Man, anything you do, it'd send him over the top, and I mean, he got that stupid laugh, so it make you laugh. Yo man - Just no professionalism whatsoever, no. But it was so different, that's what made it so beautiful, that we were so different, all the way down to Alan Rickman, god bless him, that was hilarious. He'd curse you out then invite you for wine. - 'Cause Alan was just like, I won't laugh at him. I refuse to laugh. - He always was the more respected actor, it's very close to what was going on, I'm just a comedian. - It always took Sigourney to sort of tap him just gently, she was so good with him, it's just like, come on Tim, come on. - I think the one moment in "Galaxy Quest" that really pulls everything together, when Mathesar is being tortured and they basically, to continue the torture, tell Tim Allen's character, you have to tell him that it's all fake, that you're a actor. - Mathesar, there's no such person as Captain Taggart. My name is Jason Nesmith, I am a actor. - I kept telling him that that was the most important scene in the movie and it had to be absolutely dramatic and real and painful and horrible. - I think he was worried that I was gonna be this smart-ass. - That was a piece of drama that had to be a piece of drama, and that was the only day that Steven Spielberg came to my set; Tim is going through the take after take, and he's starting to tear up, he's starting to get very emotional, and all of a sudden I hear this voice next to me, 'cause the monitor's right here, oh yeah, oh wow, I'm like, I'm about to turn and tell this person to be quiet and it's Steven Spielberg, and he goes, Tim's really great in this, I said, yeah, I know, he's doing a really good job, and then I turned back and Tim is just completely emotional, heart-wrenching actually, he says yeah, I don't like these feelings I'm having, I'd like to go back to the trailer. I said, okay fine, no, great, fantastic. And Alan Rickman no I can't tell this story. - What did he say? - I can't do it. He said, oh my god, I think he just experienced acting. - And finding those real emotional heart tugs, that's "Galaxy Quest" gift to all of us, it's why it's not just a fun movie but a great one. - It was hard for me to be that, because it was sad, you know, that I had to really get into it, and Spielberg came around the corner and he goes, wow, that was really good, Tim, like he was impressed. He startles you, 'cause it's Spielberg standing right there, and he goes, that was a really good scene. And I didn't know how to respond to that and I go, come here you, you know who this guy is? And I wanted to pick one of the movies I was unsure about. Yeah, him going, hey this guy is? He directed "1941." He would do that Spielberg, and Spielberg like,. - I never thought Tim Allen was not a good actor, so I thought he was just doing a great job in the moment. I love actors who still are children and they can't hide it, and Tim is a big child. - Of all the films that Tim Allen has done, "Galaxy Quest" is his crowning achievement. It is his best role. - You know, Tim had a rough road. We sat down and talked a lot about that. That dude been through it, so for him to go from that to this, to number one on a call sheet, come on, man. - I just don't know how to hold on to an experience like that, I loved every second of that, I hated leaving, you know... - Yeah, it was fun, it was the most fun I've had, I think, making a movie. When we got into post, all of sudden, okay now there's the movie. Another unsung hero of the film is Don Zimmerman, who was the editor of the film. - Big Daddy D! - I don't know if there is a right rhyme or reason to it, it's a feeling, you know? - He's cut everything from "Liar Liar" to some of the finer Hal Ashby films, and so he understood quirky, he understood authentic, and he and Dean became a real team on that show. - In "Galaxy Quest," it was just, it was a fun collaboration, the music and the actions and emotions, you know. - Hurry! - Climb over! - Dean was the kind of guy that he would shoot, and if he gets what he wants, he would ask anybody for an opinion, what do you, you want to try something? He would always open the door for the actors to do things. - I don't think I said, I didn't no to that much, did I? I just encouraged everybody to try everything, usually. - You know, sometimes, 90 % of the time it didn't work, but on the occasion it would be brilliant, and you just go, wow! - And so Don was a good stabilizing force to create a nice environment, he'd come down to the set and talk about things, hey maybe you want a shot for this or a shot for that, so it was really a, it was quite a good group effort. - And the music, by the way, it feels like it's a riff on Trek music, but the score for "Galaxy Quest" is kind of great in and of itself. - I wasn't sure what to do with the main title, so I tried to do something that was like the original Alexander Courage main title of "Star Trek." And I played it for Dean and everyone, and they just cracked up, and it was great. Then the theme I wrote, completely wrote, which is what is in the movie now, I played second. So I played two opposite things, and we discovered that we wanted to make it as heartfelt and glorious as possible, a little bit, maybe overblown here and there, but not too much, because in the end of the movie, this becomes an extremely meaningful situation for the characters, but also for the people watching. - When I really like what I'm doing, that just carries you through, it's like, oh, look what we're gonna do today, let's do that, oh, you just get so involved in it that I forget about the suits and briefcases that might be looking over my shoulder. - You know, and there were a lot of battles fought, a lot of battles fought in the editing room. - That was the hardest part of all of it, not the screenwriting, not the Harold leaving, not the production, the post-production was the hardest part. - Dreamworks got very involved in the edit of the movie and it was a little contentious. - We have this screening where we think it's great, and that goes really badly. - I guess it was the PG-13 screening, there were some families there, and a woman followed me into the bathroom, and she was like, how dare you. This is a Tim Allen movie. - And the studio was not crazy about it. - We never recovered from that, as far as the studio was concerned, they kind of thought, like, oh, well it's not that good. - Everybody's afraid when you make a movie that it's not working because they've read it a million times, they're so invested in it... - None of the jokes are fresh anymore... - So, it's a very dangerous thing after you make a movie to screen it because it's always a mess, and then there's a whole collection of people that want to believe that they fixed it, as well, and none of it makes any sense. - But neither of us are responsible for the limo, neither of us wanted the limo. - That's right, Tim is in the limo and he falls asleep, and when he wakes up, he's on the spaceship. - Commander, commander, I'm sorry to wake you sir, but your presence is requested on the command deck. - That's how it was originally conceived, and I'll admit to you, I sort of saw it like "The Wizard of Oz," right? That could this be a dream or not? But ambiguous, you're never told whether it is or it isn't. That shot of the car going up makes it completely literal. I mean, I get it, they were worried that there was a logic problem, that ends up being a lot of studio notes end up often being about believability and logic. I think they were worried that the kids wouldn't get it. - They cut all these scenes to make it a kid-friendly movie. - And then they just said, okay well now it's Christmas, it's PG, it's Tim, just finish it. - The worst day on "Galaxy Quest," the darkest day on "Galaxy Quest" was when "Rugrats: the Movie" came out, because "Rugrats: the Movie" was a G-rated film and it made a butt-load of money, and so all eyes turned to us and like, you need to make this a G movie. There's like, infamously that moment where Sigourney Weaver is like, she just goes like, "this!" But they put screw in her mouth. - Chompers? Oh, screw that! - And if you look at her mouth, it's like... - That's not what she said. - It was an F. - She says another thing, and you can tell what is, but you didn't shoot an alternate. - It's hilarious, and obviously we didn't even cover it, like we didn't even try not to do it. - Well fuck that! That was terrible. - Man, I just want that director's cut man, 'cause we cussed through that whole movie. - Sometimes you thought, well why don't they appreciate us more, why don't they see what they have? Don't they see who's in this movie, and haven't they read the script, and don't they see who's directing, and aren't they really thrilled that they have this very special movie, and honestly, I don't know the answer to that, but you didn't get that feeling, let's put it that way. It's really a very sophisticated movie. - With eight-year-old audiences. Dreamworks pictures presents, Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, "Galaxy Quest." - What was in danger of happening was that marketing on that movie, which runs usually the show, believed that that was a Christmas movie for, I would say, eight to 12-year-olds, and we believed we were making a movie for everybody. - Now, granted, Dreamworks I think could've did a better job promoting that movie, but I got to give them credit on the fact of, when they cut all the profanity out of that movie, it worked. - When it comes to "Galaxy Quest," you cannot deny that the movie works, and I wonder, although I acknowledge that Sigourney Weaver saying in that moment instead of screw would have been funnier, if that limits the movie in any way, Sigourney Weaver or Tim Allen or any of the characters cursing, is the joke worth it? And I would say I'm kind of siding with keeping it PG in that moment. - The artistic process of what makes a diamond is the two pieces of coal just rubbing up against each other, and two opposing forces that really make something great. It's a horrible process to go through sometimes, but it really does, you know, it's just like when you don't have enough money to make something, it makes you be more creative in a lot of ways. - It was better family-friendly as a PG movie. I think it worked better. - Those inside jokes that you have, you can have them with your kids, like clapping weird, or just, never give up, never surrender, all of that stuff, you can do that with your children and it makes a really good shared experience. - When I saw it at the Chinese Grauman Theater, I thought the movie was gonna be huge. - Oh, not another sci-fi boys in space movie, where ugly aliens are threatening our universe? I'm afraid it is, it's "Galaxy Quest." - I went straight from seeing "Galaxy Quest" to a Christmas party, and I was raving about the film. I was like, guys, you gotta see "Galaxy Quest." It's got everything you could possibly want in a movie by any measure, this movie's gonna be a massive hit, but it wasn't. - And I remember at the premiere we had a premiere it was on a weekend day at the Grauman's, and some people came out, some industry people came out who were well aware of how a movie's being sold and the expectation, and turned to me and said, well I can't believe how good it is, I had no idea. - If you think that this is just a film for kids, that would be the first and biggest mistake. Anybody who thinks this a film just for eight-year-olds, big, big mistake. - What I did particularly like about this film, Alan Rickman's wonderful performance as the half-reptile, - half-man. - He does that well, - doesn't he? - His makeup is sort of falling apart, Sigourney Weaver's blonde wig, I mean, wonderful things, I think it's a lovely film. - Do you know what, I think it actually hits what it aims for, which happens very rarely with a film. - Just more people should have seen that movie. - Dude, you made the perfect gumbo, but you forgot to invite people to dinner, man. - You never got the sci-fi crowd, you couldn't tell what the movie was. - They needed a kid's movie, and they chose this one, but it still managed to find an audience, and kind of become a beloved movie. - It wasn't a flop, it looked like it was gonna be a flop, it dug itself out of being a flop by the virtue of it being good. - It did, in fact, cover every single base. It got serious, then it got stupid, then it got funny, then it got clever, then it was more clever than you... - I remember the feeling when I saw it, I just kinda went, phew, you know, good, that actually came together okay. - More than that, it was just really satisfying to hear, to get calls or emails from people who really, really got it and it just went on their list right away as one of their favorites, you know? - Patrick say it was blown away by it, and what did he say? He said to Dean, let me say something to you. I love this film. - It wasn't until I got older, like around I became a teenager I really just noticed all the writing, all the jokes, all the clever satire it pointed out. - It's one of my favorite films, I have it on my phone so I can watch it anytime I want on the airplane. - There is a symbiotic relationship between artist and fan. We love this thing and we wanna honor it, and the artist said we would not be here without you. - There's no doubt that the relationship between storytellers and artists and fans is a much more intimate one. The meta-ness of something like "Galaxy Quest" was one of the first stories to kind of really shine a light on something like that and to really exploit it and not be afraid of it. - When J.J. and Alex and Bob and Bryan Burk and I first got together to talk about whether or not we should make "Star Trek" as a movie, we talked about "Galaxy Quest" incessantly, in fact, we all referred to "Galaxy Quest" as the second-best Trek movie. So I'd say that "Galaxy Quest" had a tremendous tonal effect on certainly the first Trek. - I've been working at Marvel lately, and Kevin Feige is a huge fan of "Galaxy Quest" as are all of the creative production executives over there, because why wouldn't they be? - I mean, Dean could have directed "Guardians of the Galaxy," I think. - I loved "Guardians of the Galaxy," I thought it was great. - I'm just James Gunn and I spoke about "Galaxy Quest" and knowing James, I'm sure It's a huge favorite of his. - So I went to see "Guardians of the Galaxy," which I liked a lot, and I said, you know, this is clearly sprung from the loins of "Galaxy Quest." - What a great compliment too, though, I mean like, there's DNA from other things in "Galaxy Quest," it's like that DNA keeps getting passed on. Just so long as you pull it off, it's fine. - And it made me go back to "Galaxy Quest" and said, let's re-examine it, let's talk about what to do with it. I wrote a pilot, and, miraculously, everybody wanted to do it, including, I had heard, Alan, - It's a great time to be a '90's kid, a TV series based oh, on "Galaxy Quest" is officially in the works. - I was gonna do the Amazon thing. - All the stars were aligning to reestablish it. Everybody said yes. - And I had some scenes with Alan, you know, I had a couple scenes with Alan. And then that just, you know. - I saw him about six weeks before he passed away, he came to see a play that I was doing in New York, and we saw him backstage and he was a little frail, and he said he'd had a stroke, and we were like, what? But he was with his wife and he came to the theater, flew to New York and see plays, and we went to dinner afterwards and he was just, you know, funny and sweet and was so lovely, and then he died like six weeks later. He didn't want us to know he was dying, he'd said he'd had a stroke, and so that the evening was not in any way morbid or sad, it was just another little Alan's here, he's getting better, and... I don't he'd mind me saying this, I hope not, Alan. Forgive me, but he had to drop out of a project because of his illness, because of the stroke, he'd said, and he goes like, and I go like, oh, who got the role? And he goes like, Bill Nighy, with great disdain. - Well, I think his work has, first of all you knew right away that here was such a brilliant actor who didn't take himself seriously, who probably on some level, like me with Tawny, felt he could have had a very different career if maybe times were different or he'd had different goals, that he could've been a great King Lear or what have you, and he brought all that truth to it, and Alan was such a truthful actor. You know honestly I can't imagine our little ensemble without Alan particularly, but without any one of us, but I think the fact that Alan Rickman had chosen to come over and do this with us gave us such legitimacy, you know. - He just, he was funny and sardonic and caustic and... - His bedside manner would seem sort of misanthropic... - And the thing that I remember most about him is the day we were saying goodbye I said, thanks so much for being in this movie, and it's been great to work with you, and he said, it's been fun intermittently. - Actually, he was the opposite of that. He was such a kind-hearted, affable, beautiful guy, but he had this very sort of dry, you know, English thing where he sort of seems like he's over everything which made him very funny, but actually he was one of the kindest people out there. - Instead of judging me, he accepted me, and acceptance is a huge thing to have somebody accept it, not only accept it, but then honor who I was. - He was the first movie star that wanted to be my friend. - I did a play years later that he was just leaving, so, and I, such a huge regret, we had a couple performances where I could've entered the play early and had overlap and done it with him, and I felt like I wasn't ready, and I got a card in my dressing room that just said, in really like, flowing cursive, and then there's a sunset, it just said you. It was really funny, and then the stuff inside was really sweet, but it was the funniest, he just had a great sense of humor. - By Grabthar's Hammer... - When we meet Sir Alexander Dane, he does not want to say By Grabthar's Hammer anymore. - By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus... - Don't do that, I'm not kidding. - I'm sorry sir, I was only... - Just don't. - The whole movie is a setup for, can we create a moment where this actor in character as Dr. Lazarus actually says that line and means it for the first time? And that's the moment in "Galaxy Quest." - He just gets really centered and he gives Quellek this gift... - By Grabthar's Hammer, by the sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged. - And I got to, you know, watch him do it, it was just magical. - Every time I see that, I get chills. I remember when I saw "Galaxy Quest" in the theater, the entire audience just went quiet when it happened, and it's like, we were just laughing like 20 seconds ago, 'cause Tony Shalhoub blew some dudes out of a door, and now here we are in this very intense emotional moment. - He hates the line, but yet then he understands, he then understands what it really means, and that's his aha moment in the movie, was like, this really does mean something, you know. - That's "Galaxy Quest's" enduring gift to all of us. - The reason why we even did the crew in the first place was when Alan Rickman died, I made Dr. Lazarus' prosthetic head wearing those costumes, and me as Dr. Lazarus as a tribute to him. By Grabthar's Hammer, that's when I'm doing Alan Rickman's character, that's, you know... - He never says it, but when someone says it to him... - I'm not saying that line one more time, yes. - There's a "Galaxy Quest" viewing. - Yeah, today at the Regent. - I've put many shows together here at this venue, and I totally thought the upper ceiling is like 200 people, and then we sold out over 400 people in 48 hours. - I mean, it's a family affair, right? You're gonna do something crazy that makes it nice if you do it together, because then you have something to talk about stop it, you would just stop for one second, I would be done. - I get off work at four, so I've been sewing from five o'clock until midnight for nine days. - And he remade the suits how many times? - This is my fourth generation suit. - I'm excited to see the screenwriter and the director... - Mathesar, Enrico Colatoni, yes he's my hero. I mean, he is my hero but if I never meet him, I'll be okay, but he is my hero, like. The Thermian ones, Roxanne and I will take these two, OK? This is so much fun, I love being a Thermian, it's so much fun. - It's more of an homage, kind of like the film itself was. It seems only fair to say thanks, it's us saying thank you for this awesome experience, you know. Dean? - I think I'm most excited about the fact that people are still celebrating "Galaxy Quest" even though it's been years and years, and it was just a movie, it wasn't part of a big franchise or anything, but the fact that there's an event like this going on just makes my heart sing. Everyone can take your seats now. - By the end of the movie, you are celebrating that, right? That is actually an amazing thing that we do, that we can just give up everything and lose ourselves in this thing. - For the most part, the nerds have inherited the earth, you know, so they were right. - My whole pitch has gone down in 18 years, I don't think I can do that. - Try it. So we have Thermians here in the audience, how does this feel to you to see that? - This is like a meta on top of a meta on top of meta, yeah. Did Harold regret it, did he ever say? - He saw the movie, loved it, and he said, the biggest mistake I made. How do you see the legacy of "Galaxy Quest?" - Legacy? Never give up, never surrender! - Every film has its own personality, every film has its own life, and you can see the love behind the camera on the screen. - What is the value of this silly thing we all do about what movies are and how we do them and why they're worth something and how we can mock them all we want, but eventually we fall for it. - Being a nerd isn't about the thing you love, it's about the way that you love it. I think that a lot of people who grow up as outsiders, we can find a home in science fiction, because it tells us, that thing that makes you weird in the world that you live in, it actually makes you incredibly valuable and really special in our world. - He's my hero.
