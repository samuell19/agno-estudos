Yes, hold on... She's not picking up. Ah, the answering machine. Oh well… Hello. I'm calling from Benimamet Primary School, and wanted to let you know that your daughter Ana María Gómez is not feeling well. She went to the school infirmary and the doctor recommended rest. Please call us back as soon as possible, and come over here to pick up your daughter. Yes, hello. I've just received a call from the school saying that my daughter is sick and to come pick her up. Yes, I just called and you didn't answer. I was here, i just didn't have time to make it to phone. Okay, don't worry, it isn't important. Do you want me to call her father to pick her up? No, no, it's not a big deal, I'll be there in a few minutes. I won't be long. Okay, see you later. What happened? I don't know much, just what you heard. Ana is ill and I have to pick her up. Sugar? Yes, please. Two Okay. I'm leaving it on the table. Okay. You'll see... Juan? Hi, this is Ana. I just got a call from the school. Ana María is ill and I need to go pick her up. Wait, wait, she's ill? What's wrong with her? You said you received a call from the school? Yes. Well, I don't know. I just hope this isn't another one of your lies to prevent me from seeing my daugther this weekend. Because if so, you will be sorry. You are not following the deal we agreed on. My turn is this weekend. I know it. As soon you know how she is, just call me, okay? Yes, yes, sure… If she is feeling okay, then I'm going to come pick her up. But right I can't come. I wonder why I'm not surprised Next weekend I'll be in another part of the city working, I won't be able to have her with me next weekend. Don't turn off the phone! Don't worry. That's not the situation. The point is that you prefer to party with your friends rather than enroll your daughter in a good school, and this is the result. What the fuck are you talking about? I enrolled here there because it is close to both of us. Or do you want her to cross the whole city by bus every day? - Juan, just go to hell! - Don't give me that… You sound just as stupid as you always do. Who do you think you are? Listen, Juan. I've to collect our daughter, so, as you can imagine, I haven't got time for any more of your bullshit. Just go pick her up already! Don't spend a half an hour doing your make-up like you did before, all right? Are you stupid or what? Anyway, when I pick her up I'll take her to the doctor's to see what's wrong. Tell me something here... How many men have you fucked in front of my daughter? You're such an asshole, what do you think this is? An interrogation? Leave me alone. Yes, go ahead and deny it! I just hope our kid doesn't grow up to be like you. Listen Juan, don't piss me off. I'm going to pick her up and take her to the doctor's office. Bye! Dont forget - This guy is a prick. He lives right by the school and he's saying he can't pick his own daughter up, that he's got other things to do… Always full of excuses. Don't worry, I'll go with you. Fuck your ex... But no need to throw out the coffee. I know, I'm sorry. But this guy gets on my nerves. I know. But don't let him upset you. But that's not the point. We have a daughter together and Juan always calls me stupid, as if… He looks down on me and… What does he think? That I can't take care of her? Hey, hey! Come on That doesn't annoy me, what really irritates me is… Ah, how could I be so blind? Has he always been such a bastard? No, he had an edge, but not like this. Maybe he's still in love with you and arguing makes him feel like he did when you were together. Well, I don't know... It could be. And that's why he asks how many guys you've slept with. Listen, doesn't he know about us? No, he doesn't. Nobody does. I mean we only just finalized the divorce, so the last thing I want is for Juan to find out. I get it. But please understand my position. We're no longer kids, we shouldn't have to hide our feelings. Listen, Carlos. That's not the point. Okay? - Okay, so what is the point then? Let's see, Carlos. I have to pick my daughter up, take her to the doctor's and then take you to the airport, so as you can see... No, no need to take me to the airport. Just drop me at the subway entrance. I can take you to the airport but don't come back with stupid comments about... No, forget it. Take the girl to the doctor and then let me know. Okay, perfect. Yes, perfect. Listen! I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to say anything, it's just that... I know. Every time I speak to Juan... Yes, I understand... You're not angry, are you? No, I'm not. It's just that that comment annoyed me and I'm going to be late getting to the airport, okay? Okay. Did you pack everything? Yes. Yes. Let's go, but drop me off at the entrance. Okay? Okay. Okay. Have you seen my keys? For fuck's sake, Ana! No, I haven't. Ready? Yes. So, who's going to pick you up at the airport? I guess my sister Paula will. No one else could come. Oh, no? So? Will you call me when you get there? Or should I call you? I'll do it. I don't mind. I'm saying it just in case you forget... No, I will remember. But I don't know what time I'll arrive at the hospital, and it's better if I phone you. I'll call you as soon as I get to the hospital. Okay? Okay. It's because I'm worried about you, there with your mother the whole time. Yes, I know, but I don't know anything about what my brother has planned. What did they say? Because if you're going to spend the whole weekend at the hospital... If they called me, it is for a reason. I'm saying this because Elena invited me to go out. Okay. You sure it's okay? Yes, you're a grown up. Do whatever you like. Couldn't you leave this tuned where it is? Sure, I always change it, and then I forget about it and... Yeah. What time is it? I don't know but it doesn't matter. We have plenty of time, there's no need to worry. Plenty, plenty... Of course, Carlos. We have plenty of time. I know the way and we'll be there in a few moments. Fine. Listen! You haven't told me anything about you mom's surgery. Is she going to be in the hospital for a long time? We don't know. It depends on how the surgery goes. But it was something simple, right? Yes, but at her age anything could go wrong, so... She's going to stay there under observation for a while. Right... A friend of my mother had something similar and she wasn't under observation for long at all. I hope it's the same with my mum, because I'm fed up with traveling, hospitals, sleeping in different beds. You see! That's what I mean. You don't have to put up with everything during the weekend. Come on! What do you want me to do if my siblings are there during the week? Sure, but you're not on vacation, you're working. Yeah, I know. But what do you want me to do? Tell them that I can't go and distance myself? For fuck's sake, she's my mom! No, of course not. Do whatever you want. Please, give her a kiss from me when you see her. Okay? Okay. From whom should I say it's from? My girlfriend... or just a friend? Come on, Carlos! Come on, Carlos! Yes... Look, do whatever you want. Fuck, the traffic light! Please, stop getting uptight. No matter how many times you look at the clock... Ana, if I miss this train, I'll miss my flight. I thought I could take you to the airport. I'm not blaming you but shit... That's how things go. So, you don't mind if I go out? About Ana? To go out with Elena? No, it doesn't bother me. As I told you, you can do whatever you like. You made a face when I told you. Well, if you want to party while I'm at the hospital, it's up to you. I love your capacity for turning things around. It's... We're getting close. Okay. Please, go ahead. You always manage to find the pedestrians when you are running late. I'm sorry... What do you want me to do? Run them over? Come on! I'm not saying it's your fault! Shit! Sometimes it is impossible to talk to you... It was just a comment. Look! That's it. I'll park there. No, look, park there. No, no way... That's not a good one. Honestly! I'm going to miss the train. No, you're not. I'll park there in a second. Up to you! Okay, I'll stop, but please let me get over there at least. Fine. You're leaving like this? Not even a... How do you want me to leave? Not even a hug? You know that I'm going to miss you, don't you? It won't be long, okay? Carlos! What? Wait! I'll help you out with your bag. I only have this. Wait. Please, forgive me. You're not upset with me, are you? No, I'm not. How could I? You know I love you. See you soon. Carlos! I love you. I love you too. I'm so sorry for what happened back there. I'm going, okay? Yes. Hi, Ana! Hi!, Elena! I won't make it to Pilates, I'm sorry. Damn! What's going on? I just got a call from Ana's school. She's ill and I have to pick her up. I'm sorry. Nothing serious I hope... Well, I hope not too. Isn't it her father's turn this weekend? Of course it's his turn this weekend, but they called me, so what could I do? What does he think? That the girl is a toy and if she's ill then he doesn't need to take care of her or what? No, exactly what you say... This weekend was his turn, but it's okay. You'll see, step by step he is going to get bored with caring about the kid after he's met some twenty year-old bimbo and he's gotten her knocked up. You'll see, he isn't going to have any interest in her after that! Oh well. But one thing's for sure... If he doesn't pay my alimony, he can forget about seeing her. Yeah, but I am sure he will say that he's short on money, that he has parking tickets he has to pay. I'll tell you, in my experience it's always the same story. They always start off well, but little by little they lose interest in paying it. Remember what happened to me with Jose Antonio. When he stops paying, do not let him see the kid. Yes, yes. I agree. But the thing is that at the last minute our daughter always asks for him, and despite it all, he's still her father and I feel bad. Anyway, what about next weekend? Oh! About next weekend ...Of course! I wouldn't miss it for anything! Yeah, you must go out, meet people, you know? By the way, what are you going to wear? No idea what to wear. It depends where we go, something casual. But yeah, no idea. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure that you will show up in a tight dress and high heels! No, how dare you say that! I know you! No, you're wrong! Listen, Elena - I've got to go, okay? I just arrived to the school. Okay, I hope it's nothing serious... I will call you later, okay? Okay, bye! Hi. Good morning. Hi. I'm looking for the head teacher. Yes, one moment. I'll call him. Hello. Is Mr. Francisco there? Oh. Okay. No, no. It's just because a mom wants to see him. Okay. Yes. No problem. Let me see... Just one moment, please. Your name is...? Ana Perez. Ana... Didn't you come in earlier? Yes, of course. When I dropped off my daughter this morning. Well, I'm sure it was that. The head teacher is not here, but the director of studies is, which is the same thing. It is? Go down the corridor, it's the second door on the left. Second left. Second on the left. I'll tell him that you're coming. Okay, see you later. Just one moment. Just one moment. Please come in. Sorry, I had to answer that call. Please, take a seat. I received a call from your staff asking me to pick up my daughter, because she felt sick. Her father should have come to get her but I called him and he told me that he couldn't. So, I came. I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean. Let's see. I got a call from this school and you told me that my daughter was feeling sick. I spoke to a man. I don't know his name. He told me that my daughter was feeling sick and asked me to pick her up. Wait, because I don't understand any of this. No, I'm the one who doesn't understand what's happening. Keep calm, Ana! We'll call the teacher. Who's your daughter? Ana Maria Gomez. Okay then. Don't worry! Her teacher is Mrs. Puri. We'll check the class she's in and I'll call her. She'll explain it all, don't worry. Okay. But the problem is that I get a call from you guys telling me that my daughter is ill, and when I get here you don't know anything about it. It's a bit strange. Are you are the director of studies? Yes, madam! Ana Maria Gomez, Gomez... Ana Gomez is in first A, her teacher is Mrs. Puri. You were right. Please wait here a moment and I'll be right back with her. Maybe she was feeling better and now she's back in class. Excuse me, Mrs. Puri. Could you come out here a moment? What's wrong? Well, there's a mom in my office asking for her daughter. She says that someone called her to pick her daughter up. And I was made to look like a fool. Why I was not informed of this? I think I still have a say in what goes on here at this school. Or so I think, right? I think I still have a say in what goes on here at this school. Or so I think, right? Listen, this is the start of the term and I know that you're not used to the rules of this school. But if something similar to what's going on now were to happen again, I'd have no choice but to take disciplinary actions against you. Is that clear? Yes, but the ting is that the girl never even made it to class. As I'm sure you'll appreciate, the office has already taken care of everything. They phoned the mother, they informed me and I told them to write a letter from the school to the parents. And of course, to inform the head teacher or, in his absence, the director of studies, you. If they haven't done that, then what can I say or do? Well, this changes everything. Sorry if I've been rude to you, but I'm a bit shaken. Mrs. Puri, can I go to the bathroom, please? Of course, dear. Please, don't take too long. As soon as I finish talking to the director here, we'll pick up the math lesson. Anyways, as far as my feelings go, I understand your reaction but I don't like the way you said it. Anyway, let's just go talk to the mother. Sorry. This is Mrs. Puri, your daughter's teacher. Fine. And Ana? Please take a seat. No, I'm fine. We didn't think you would come. It's a pleasure. Well... Please, take a seat. No, thanks. I'm fine. Well, your daughter never made it to my class. Just before we started, she went to the bathroom and started to feel sick. One of the teachers passed by, saw her and took her to the nurse. The office told me about it and I guess they phoned you then. But that was an hour ago. What time did you say they phoned you? I didn't tell you the time. Calm down, Madam! Hold on, I'll call the office. Please, remain calm. This has to be some sort of a misunderstanding. Paco, come here right now. Please Ana. This has to be a misunderstanding. Maybe your husband came to pick her up. Maybe. Now you guess... If I were you... - Calm down, Madam! - Shut up! I wouldn't be so relaxed because... May I come in? Paco, this is Ana Perez. Mother of Ana Maria Gomez. This morning she got a call because her daughter was feeling sick, but now her daughter is not here. Can you explain where her daughter is? Tell me where my daughter is! Well... Please relax. I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding and there's an explanation. Okay. So... I'll have a look at the visitor log. Do it now! One moment, please. Let's see! Madam, please calm down. It's here, your daughter is Ana... Ana Maria Gomez. Correct. Yes, it's here. Someone picked her up early this morning. You gave my daughter to a stranger? No, no. Who has my daughter or who took her? No, no. Please, Paco. Look at that list right now! Please, let's see... Ana Perez came to pick her up. Ana Perez... Yes, here. Ana Perez, are you stupid or what? - Please, Madam. - I won't admit... Please, please. How come? My goodness! I'll be right back... I'm going to call the police. If my daughter doesn't turn up, you'll all be in for it! Yes, hello? I have your daughter, but if you keep making a racket I'll have to get rid of her, okay? Leave the school, get in your fucking car and wait for my call. Don't you even fucking try to call the police or you won't see your daughter alive again. What do you want? Where's my daughter? If you want to see your daughter again, you'd better do exactly as I say. I guarantee you that this isn't going to be easy, and if you fail or you break the rules, you will never see your daughter again. It is simple. - I'll be giving you instructions. - Okay... But what? The first instruction is for you to calm down. In two minutes I am going to call again. Listen! No, please wait! Fuck! Fuck, Carlos! Juan! Juan, please pick up the phone! Juan, please! I've just been to the school and our girl is not there. Calm down, I don't understand, say it again slowly. Who is not where? What do you mean? Ana! What? Wait, wait... But you told me that you left her at the school? Yes. I don't know. I don't know what happened. I went to pick her up after I called you, because she was ill. But how do you know somebody kidnapped her? Because... Yes, yes... Calm down, calm down. How the hell you want me to calm down?! But how do you know that someone has kidnapped her? Because they called and told me not to call the police or I will never see her again! Wait right there, I am coming there with the police. Are you still at the school? Don't move, I'm coming with the police. No, don't even think about calling the police. Do you want them to kill her? Damn it, Juan! Just don't do it! I'm sorry I insulted you this morning, but please do your best to get my girl back. Forgive me, I behaved like an idiot. But she is my dauther... Trust me, go home and wait there. I will call police. No, no. Trust me. No, hold on. Another number is calling me. Who is it? How the fuck do I know? I'll call you later. Yes, hello? Don't scream again. - And don't call the police... Got it? - Okay, I understand. Now you will go home and retrieve all documents that you have. Documents? But...? All documents, including mortgage documents and medical records. But... Yes, I got it, but why do you want those documents? You're going to put all those documents in a briefcase, and you are going to wait for my call. Okay, I'll put it all in. When I tell you to put everything in, I mean everything, got it? Let me speak to her, please! Just put her on, please! The game has just begun... And remember, do not do anything weird if you want to see your daughter alive... But listen. Fuck! Juan, fucking pick up the phone! Juan... He told me to go home and grab some documents! Go home and wait... Did he tell you how much he wants? What the fuck does he want with a bunch of documents? He hasn't mentioned anything about money. Do not give him anything... I will call the police. Okay... No, don't call the police! Do you want them to kill her?! I'm telling you, they called me to tell me to go home and grab some documents, but they didn't mention anything about money. Do not give anything to them... I will call the police. You go home and wait there. I bloody can't wait around! I'm almost home, I'll call you later. Ana, I love... Fuck! Come on! Okay... The person who you are calling is not available, please leave a message. - Hello? - I told you this is a game. I'm going to give you everything you want. I have the briefcase... I have everything, but please don't touch her. She's my only one. It's up to you to be alive or dead. Until you finish the game you won't see your daughter. Listen... Do you have everything? I told you to have everything! Okay. Yes. I have everything but I don't even know what you want, so I can't… But please, you can cover your face. I'll bring it all to you. Now you must go to the parking garage on the south side of the city. To the parking garage? But what...? Under the shopping center... You have seven minutes. No, you won't give me more time? Please just give me more time. Hurry up, the clock is ticking... No. Listen. Please, let me talk to her... Motherfucker! This is a game, isn't it? Okay... Let's play. 112, what is your emergency? Hi. Please, My name is Ana, I need help. I'm being blackmailed. My daughter has been kidnapped. Calm down... What is your name? My name is Ana. Ana, very well, sweetie, tell me where you are right now. I'm going to a parking garage. Which parking garage? The one in the shopping center. In the south of the city. Okay, what is your car, how can we recognize it? I'm driving a small car. It's metallic grey. Ana, calm down, stay cool. Nothing is going to happen to your daughter... But listen to me. What is your daughter's name? Hello? Tell me... What is your daughter's name? Yes, but... Her name is Ana Maria, but please hurry up. How old she is? What grade is she in? She's in the first grade... Ana, listen to me. We are going to find to your daughter. I promise. How did it happen? I don't know. I went to pick her up at school this morning and... Then the kidnapper called me and told me not to call the police or I wouldn't see her again. Then they asked me for documents. Calm down, calm down. How many times has he called you? I got three calls from an unknown number, but please hurry up. Okay, very well, I am going to track your phone calls. Fine! But do not hang up the phone... You are doing very well. Please, but... Ana, Ana give me a minute. Okay, but hurry up because the kidnappers told me that I wouldn't see her again and she'd be killed. And they asked me for some documents and I... No, they didn't ask for any money. Ana, you must to calm down... We are going to do everything possible to find your daughter. But if my ex-husband calls and I don't answer, he'll call the police and if he calls the police... He can't call the police. I'll track your husband's phone... We'll call him, okay? Calm down. Okay? What if they hurt her? They could do something to her in there. They will not do anything to your daughter. Yes, they'll do something to her if I don't go in. They won't do anything to your daughter. I have to go in. No, listen, we are going to call him, but do not enter that building. I'm almost there. Tell me what to do. Do not go in, wait for the police, please. Please, do not enter. Okay? I must enter. Ana? No, don't call her father because he'll call the police and will mess it all up. No. Wait Ana, the police are coming. Hey, listen! I have to hang up as I'm there, okay? Thank you for your help, but I can't wait. Ana, the police are coming! Yes, hello? I told you that this is a game. Hello? What is this, some kind of joke? There was supposed to be someone here to hand the briefcase to. Who the fuck is in there? Listen! There is nobody here. I told you not to call the police. No, I haven't told anybody. I swear! And now you'll never see your daughter again... You probably heard my ex-husband calling me, running his mouth. I haven't called the police, and I really am here by myself. Leave your phone in your fucking car and get into the car I left for you. The keys are inside. The car you left... Okay. Okay, look! I'll leave my phone here, okay? Fuck! I know you're looking at me. I know you're watching me, you son of a bitch! Come on, show yourself! Listen very carefully for the next step. I'm fed up with this game, with you, with going from place to place... If my daughter doesn't show up or if you don't let me talk to her... Shut up, bitch! Now listen to me. You have to go to the Hotel Vora Fira... And then go to the first floor... Now to the Hotel Vora Fira? But...? Shut up, bitch! You must go to first floor and knock on room 117. In there you will finish your assignment. Okay, yes... Don't play with me. You want your briefcase, right? Do you want it? So let me speak to her first. I want to know that she's fine. If this is what you want, I'll let you listen to her voice. Hi Mom... I'm having a lot of fun with this game... Ana? Thank God! Tell me where you are playing. Tell me where so mommy can come and play with you. Come on, tell me where you are. I said I'd let you listen to the child, not interrogate her... No, I'm trying to do that! You think I'm stupid? Is that what you fucking you think? Now... You have broken the rules... No! Mommy, don't cry, when you cry you are not pretty. Ana? Damn, Ana. Thank God! Now you know to follow the rules. You son of a bitch! Now do what I tell you, you have four minutes to reach the Hotel Vora Fira, so hurry... Okay... But when I get there, I promise I'll kick your ass! Motherfucker! The clock is ticking... Tick tock, tick tock... Okay. Come on... I'll make that light. I'll reach it. For fuck's sake! Hi. Good morning, madam! Would you like some tissues? No, I don't want anything! Go away! Look, we have mint, piña colada... Please, it's for charity! I don't fucking want anything. If you don't want one... I can clean your car. Fuck! I don't want anything. What are you doing, you jerk? Madam, I won't be long. Listen, get off the car! Please madam, whatever you can spare, two euros. For charity. Get off! Please, madam. Okay, it's me, I don't have money. Madam, I cleaned your car... Bitch! Fucking hell! Get off! Fuck! Fuck. Shit. Juan, a man has just been run over. It's all my fault, shit! What are you talking about? I'm on my way to the Hotel Vora Fira. The hotel? What are you talking about? To the hotel... Yes. Listen to me. I'm on my way to the hotel... Just listen and shut up! I'm on my way to the Hotel Vora Fira and they told me that they will give me the girl back, okay? How do you know that? Nothing will happen to me. Yes. Everything is under control. Juan, everything is under control. I'll call you right back, okay? Bye! Wait! It could be a trap! Wait... You brought the briefcase, right? Yes, it's here. Leave it on the bed. Want to know something? When something horrible happens to you, that is when you really remember the past... ...When you miss the good things the most. Listen, I want this to end right now, so... I don't want to go on with this any longer. I just want this to end right now, so tell me where my daughter is because... Let's see what's in the case... Is there a combination? No, none. Listen, I've done everything just as you said. Now... Shsssh! Okay. Very well. Right, you've done your part of the deal. Let's get what you're looking for. - What? Isn't she here? - No. But she was supposed to be here. I wish, but this is how things are going to happen. Listen... I don't like this at all. Tell me where the fuck my daughter is! Do you really think I'm enjoying this? But that's how it goes. Where's the car? I left it... I left it down there... Just right down there. Let's go then! Listen, I won't move until you tell me where my daughter is! It's a miracle that we both reached this point, okay? We're about to settle this matter. And now you back out? You displease me. Listen, I want this to end as soon as possible, I really do. But I need you to cooperate. Look... Look at this rose... I had nothing to do with it. Maybe it was picked this morning. But now it's in my hands. It's delicate. And I can break it whenever I want to. Hey! No. I'll take the briefcase - if you don't mind. Come on, to the car. Okay, calm down. Let's take the stairs. Come on, walk! Come on! What are you doing? Go! Quick! Get out! Where is the car? Fuck! Let's go! It was supposed to be here. What? Where is the car? It was supposed to... hey, relax! Okay? It should be here... Where is the car? It should be parked here. I parked it here. I asked you to come with the car. Yes, I did. I came with the car you left me, but... Fuck! Where is the car? I don't... I'm sorry, I don't know. It was supposed to... What the hell do you think this is? A game? No, no! Where the fuck is the car? Shit! I don't know, please don't... Please... Fuck, fuck! Hey, listen please... Stop. What are you doing, jerk? Get out of the fucking car! Get out of the car, come on! Damn it, get out! Get out the car, come on! Out! Hey, no! Please, don't hurt her. She's got nothing to do with this. Fuck! Now - inside! Come on, get inside! Get fucking moving! Come on. Okay, I'm going. Go on! This is getting out of hand, okay? Shut up and drive. Go straight ahead. Yes, I'll go straight ahead. Listen. Wait because... Okay. Shut up and go. Go, go, go. Fuck! Who are they? Go, go! Who are they? The ones following you? Why are they chasing you? Ignore them and keep going! Okay. Fuck! Bloody hell! Take the first left. Okay. But who were they? Keep going! They have nothing to do with you, just drive! Go this way. Hey. This is about money, right? Money has nothing to do with it Do you still think this is about money? Shut up and drive. Straight ahead. Yes. You're going to head out of town. Fine, yes... You are going to take the first exit on the right towards a country road. Okay. Yes. Yes, as we agreed. Okay. Aren't you the person I've been talking to? What's this? What the hell is going on? Take the left. Hush! So you weren't the person I've been talking to? Are you having a hard time controlling her? No, it's not difficult to control her. Don't worry. Tell her shut up or I will kill her daugther. I told her to shut up and she doesn't even know the first rule. What the fuck do I know?! You've just stolen this fucking car. So this is not my fault! Okay, yes. Calm down. That's it! We're getting out. You must come here or I will kill your daughter too. You're fucking out of your mind! Who is it? It's your boss, isn't it? Hey, you son of a bitch, I want my girl back! Shut up, okay? Tell her to shut up or you will kill her, but only do it when you are past the city limits. No, no, you can't to give me that order, please, I have been doing exactly as you've told me, please! She must be killed. Damn it! Okay... Shit... When you get past the city limits, kill her. What shall I do? It's a security checkpoint. What shall I do? Stop! Stop! Hush! They can help us. Shut up! Stop there on the side. Shush! They can help us. Okay, okay. Do exactly as you are told. Yes, yes. Good morning. Please, may I have your IDs? Good morning. Sure! Thank you. May I have your vehicle documentation, please? One moment. Whose car is this? Is it yours? No, it belongs to a friend of mine. And where are you heading to? We're going home… To a friend's home to get some things. You know women… They want to get their stuff right away. What shall I do? Please, pull over to the side. My colleague will be you shortly. But… Shut up, shut up!! What can we do? Who were the ones following the car? Hey! Shut up. Get out of the car immediately. Is there a problem? Because we are… We are in a bit of a hurry. We were… Please come over here, I found something. Please go ahead. Wait. Come on, drive. Okay. Whatever you say. Shall I go now? Yes. That was close. That was very close. Fuck! They could have helped us. Hush! All right. Now turn right. Turn right? But we're leaving the city. Yes, shut up! I know that already. In this area there's some open ground. Fuck! This way. Straight on to the end. I'll tell you where… Yes. And I keep driving to the end? Yes, to the end. Fuck it! I'm not going to continue with this. What are you saying? I'm done. What the hell are you saying? Listen. What the…? Hold on! Fuck! Wait, wait, wait! I told you, I'm done! Come on, get in the bloody car! Come on, get in the car! Come on. You know that... Come on, get in the car. What are you doing? You're going to fucking spoil it all now - now?! Get in the fucking car and drive! You're Mr. Nobody. We're too close… Do you know who I am? I'm the guy with a gun who holds your daughter's life in his hands! Now shut up and drive! You're the jerk they are blackmailing, just like me. What are you doing? Wait, slow down. What if we die? Isn't that what your fucking boss wants? Isn't it what he wants? Hold on, wait! Listen... Fuck you! Hey, piss off! Wait for the surprise I have prepared for you... You know that you killed an innocent man, right? And now... I will kill his daughter, too. It's a shame... You have ruined everything... You are weak... You have always been weak. Guess who's coming... Ana? Ana? More or less. If you really thought a judge was going to take my daughter away from me, then both of you were very wrong. Motherfucker! Now if you'll excuse me, I have a briefcase that belongs to me. Ana... Ana... Yes, don't worry... I'll tell her that her mother was very nice... She will be fine with me... Well, I guess that you won't need this phone any longer. Poor woman... Hold still, I'll clean you up, you have a little blood on your lip... You know, this would not have happened if you had not pissed me off with all your lawyers... You knew I didn't like it, but you didn't want to talk... It's funny how things change... An hour ago you were at home... You were getting ready to go to the gym... And now... And now you are lying here, Bleeding to death... So we're even now, right?
