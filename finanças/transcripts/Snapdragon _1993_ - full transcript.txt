You will be the best ever. And the third drive-by shooting this week resulting in fatalities has put the community on edge, and the police department on tactical alert. And more on that in a moment, but first a traffic update from Daniel sherman in sky watch 97. How's it looking up there, Danny? T-m-c Johnathan, too many cars. We have sigalerts working on both the Santa Monica west and the ventura north, your afternoon drive out of downtown L.A. Is gonna be an absolute mess. The Hollywood freeway traffic reported a nine-injury tangle between a tanker and a pickup, traffic is backed up at the four-level exchange, and Broadway and Chinatown is tied up with the Chinese new year parade. Good luck, motorists. If you have to be in it, be careful, it's starting to look dangerous out there. How we doing? You look good, you want a date? - What do you want? - Getin. Hey, hey, I don't have a layaway plan, sorry, I get the money up front or no deal. Show me what you got first. I'm not showing you nothing - until I get the money. - Why not, come on. - No. - You wanna play rough? Huh? Huh? You son of a... Alright, alright, alright, I got him, I got him, let go. Pressed pants, asshole. Shut up! I've had it these animals, they ruin everything. Looking for reimbursement. Sit down, sergeant. Outside, I'll deal with you later. And grosky, shut the door. Guess he showed up a little late again. He's alright. - How about you? - I'm fine, don't start. Come here, I wanna show you something. Yeah, firestone from last month. The same m.O.? Exactly. She did it again. I knew it, I knew she would. This should be my case, Burt, I was the first one to call this. You be careful what you wish for. What does that mean? That the case is yours. Really? For some ungodly reason Metro seems to think that you can help them on this. You've been reassigned, you'll report downtown - in the morning. - This is my shot, Burt, this is my chance. Then you won't disappoint me, will you? No. And you will be very careful, won't you? So get outta here, you got paperwork to do. - And peck? - Yeah? You cover your ass. Ow, god, what are you doing? - What? - Peck. Fuck. Every fantasy has to have a little pain, - you should try it. - Oh man, what are you, crazy? What's that all about? Come on doc, lighten up. Put a little excitement into your dull, - drab... - No, I don't like that kind of excitement, forget it. Trust me, the guys at the department are gonna find it real exciting. What are you, embarrassed? No, I'm just a little old to be walking around with a hickey on my neck, happy? I'm gonna have to wear a damn turtleneck all week, and I hate turtlenecks. Nice, gee. No, no. Thank you. Ah, you know what, you drink too much. I'm celebrating. - Oh, celebrating? - Mmhmm. What is it now, miss Mark of the vampire? - Better than that. - What? I got transferred to homicide. Yes. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Permanent? Uh, temporary, but if I'm good I'll probably stay. Good, good, that's great. What's the case? Serial. Serial? - Confirmed? - Not officially, - but I know it is. - Mmhmm, okay. You know you get in trouble when you second guess the powers that be. What's it like, what is it? Probably with a razor or something, and then she places this black silk cloth over their eyes. Nice, the kinda girl you wanna bring home to ma. Actually I read about it, what's the body count? - Two. - Two, well then isn't it a little early to call a serial? Not for me. That's right, so young and so wise all at the same time. That's my girl. I need a favor. Please don't do this. And do a psychological profile - for me. - Oh, come on peckham, don't, we have people who do that, they're probably doing it as we speak, come on. - They're not as good as you. - Oh, come on, I talk to uniforms, the people who think they're Rambo, John Wayne, people like you, that's what I do. What does that mean, people like me? Cops that drink too much. Are you kidding me? We're now gonna enter the room where the homicide occurred. Mrs. Cullen, the manager of the hotel is Mrs. Cullen, room 23, thank you. We're approximately at the corner of college and Broadway, on a beautiful sunny day in downtown - Chinatown. - Kinda hard to think with you making all that noise. Hey look, we've been back here three times, what's to think? This guy is some borderline sex pervert, likes to pick up women in the sleazier parts of town, a real low life. Geeze, are you still on that kick? And firestone, 62, successful businessman, community leader. Went to the same church his entire adult life. And you think there's a connection? Has to be. Has to be, my aunt Francis. Look sergeant, you're new at this. Take it from me, what you're dealing with is some cuckoo crackpot broad that gets her rocks off by slicing some guy's throat while he's getting his off. Now you got any questions? - This is the key. - Geezel - so? - So, in the first place I'm not even supposed to be doing this, so would you please let me finish reading this stolen file? - Borrowed. - Yeah right. I'd guess she's mid to late 20s? Well I guess your guess is probably right, keeping in mind of course that at this point that's all it is, a guess. There's no prints at either scene, right? Clean as a bone, - she's good. - Mmhmm. Your turn, you guess. Well, I would say that she was probably sexually abused as a child, possibly by a family member or someone who knew her. Yeah, like a revenge sort of thing. Could be, but then again maybe not. You're being very helpful here. Babe, you get what you pay for, okay? See, I'm intrigued by the oriental overtones of this thing, the candles, the black silk cloth over the face, hide the eyes. Which means? The elevating of the soul to a higher place, the ending of life on a sexual high, pleasure, not pain. Now she's doing these guys a favor. I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, you. Look, this is what I find most fascinating. Yeah, what is it? I haven't a clue. Yeah, well neither does anybody else, can you find out? You want me to do your legwork for you too, huh, - your research? - I do things for you. - Oh come on peck. - Try this one on, I stopped at pathology on the way over here. - You did? - Yeah, and they said that both of these guys probably ejaculated after they died, while she was still on top of them. I didn't know that was possible, Jesus. I guess that's what they call last rites, huh? Not funny. Nah, it's not funny at all. So tell me, how bad is it? How bad is what? That hickey you're sporting under that very fashionable wardrobe. It's that obvious, Jesus. You should get some of those big bell bottoms, you know the kind Sonny and Cher used to wear? - Those real wide ones? - Yes, that would be a nice touch for me, I agree. So how's Ms. peckham? Still fulfilling one of your four basic needs? You know, she's the same, she's a friend, you know, you know, same, more or less. She said to say hello, by the way. - You give her my best. - She likes you. Hold on doctor lob, a moment of your time please? What's going on, Walter? Don't you have any idea who you're with? Well no, I can't say that I do. That's Elvis Presley. You go on ahead, I'll meet you in there. Come on, let's go. That's lovely. Really lovely. I'm doctor hoogstraten, call me David. What's your name? I don't know. You don't know? I have no idea. It's time for lunch, Felicity. Felicity? It means happiness in Latin. I know that. Nurses give them names. She's a Jane Doe, total amnesia. - Permanent? - Well, we don't know, little early to tell. Found her at the beach a couple of nights ago at the bottom of a cliff, no ID, no nothing. She's very lucky to be alive. Jumped? Might've been, might've had some help. Come on, I'll give you first shot. - Yeah. - No, this is mine and that's yours. - Come on. - Come on, that was in, that was in, that was in. - Very nice, right there. - Alright, alright, alright, I'll match it. What'd you think about that blonde Jane Doe? Felicity? - Yeah. - Nice, what about her? Well, I want you to talk to her. Uh uh, not unless she wears a badge, you know that. Oh David, come on, lighten up with the rules, will ya? Bernie, rules are what make life work, it's called civilization. Now if you please? That's the game, my friend. Listen, just bend these rules a little bit for me, will ya? Please, I need a favor. Oh, so now I'm the favor man? Well, you are since I fixed you up with your first date - when you were 12. - You also fixed me up with my ex-wife. Boy, you're not gonna let me forget that, - are ya? - Uh uh. - How much do I owe you? - No, you keep it. - Nah, come on. - Keep it, keep it. Next time double or nothing. Do me one thing though. No, now just talk to her, that's all I'm asking, just talk to her, please? Listen to me, I'm groveling. Hey man, since when did you take such an interest in your patients? I thought your rule was don't get involved? Well, this one's different. She's salvageable, most of them aren't. Now visualize the number one. The color is purple. A soft, vibrant shade of purple. And now you're at the deepest, most nerved part of your being, and you're in the middle of an immense field. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, I'm the one who's inept. Hardly. Oh well, it's only our first try. Takes time, doesn't it Bernie? Why don't you go on to bed. You look tired, get some sleep. Thank you. For what, I didn't do anything. You tried. Felicity, Dr. lob says that you've been having those nightmares. Is there anything you wanna tell me? No, not really. Okay, then goodnight, sleep tight. She obviously doesn't wanna remember, at all. Well, we're gonna have to leave it alone. You gave it a try. Oh, don't give me that crap. Come on, you're the one who said she was salvageable, and for once, for a change, you were right. Alright David, then what? Then what? She's got something inside her so deep, so deep, deep inside her, that's so ugly that she doesn't wanna dredge it out and look at it. - I agree with that. - So let's do something. We have to release her on Friday. Dr. hoogstraten? I'm sorry, there was no one outside. Nobody, oh, it's lunch already. I was a patient of Dr. lob's. I remember you, of course. Felicity, right? Please come in. - I was just... - Can I sit down? Yes, absolutely, Felicity. Dr. lob mentioned that after your release no one heard from you for three weeks. I was really sorry that we didn't continue with the hypnosis. I just thought I should talk to somebody about the dreams I've been having. Bad dreams, still? I'm really sorry to hear that, I'd very much like to help you Felicity, but you should be talking to Dr. lob. You see, I'm a police psychologist, I don't technically treat private patients. I was comfortable with you. You didn't treat me like a child. Thank you. - I'm sorry I bothered you. - Wait, Felicity, wait. You hungry? Ah, we made it. Best table in the house. No, the people in social services have been great, they helped me find an apartment and get a job. Okay, so then you're doing alright. You still depressed? Well, that's normal after trauma. It's not the depression, it's the dreams, they're more like experiences. To the subconscious dreams are experiences. We feel pain, sadness, happiness as if it were really happening. You left out fear. Well, there's nothing to be afraid of. You see, dreams are just the inner mind working out everyday problems, that's normal. Is it, is it normal to see yourself having sex with faceless strangers then killing them? That's different, but not quite as abnormal as you might think. How did these people die in your dreams? Just at the end there's always blood, lots of blood, then I wake up. Well, you just have to keep telling yourself that it's only a dream, nothing more, quite possibly the result of some deep-seeded childhood experience. Thank you, Dr. hoogstraten. I guess I feel better now that I've talked about it. This is for you. Uh-uh, don't touch the meat, - hey, hey. - Dead about six hours. - I'd make it more like nine. - And the Gage on the incision you think that's about the same, look about the same to you? At first glance I'd say so. Let me know if you find any blonde pubic hairs. - I do my job sergeant. - Good, just do it fast. Hey. Thanks, that's fine. What are you doing here? Slow day, I heard it on the cop radio and decided to come over. Wanted to see firsthand how cops get screwed up, huh? Something like that, what's with the blonde pubic hair? - Let's go outside. - Why? What, I'm not allowed in there, huh? Well, it seems she wasn't quite as clean or careful - as we first thought. - Oh come on, that could've been from anybody. No, this last guy's wife is a redhead, a real one. Why the sudden interest? It just blows the theory I was developing, - that's all. - Which was what? That your killer's an oriental. Uh uh, not with blonde pubic hair. Could've been a dye job. Don't women do that anymore? Is this a theory or an obsession? Look, you got me involved in this, I didn't ask for it. Maybe you should get uninvolved. Yeah, okay, maybe I should. May I help you? Father, good afternoon father, I'm David hoogstraten, I'm with the L.A. police, and I was wondering if you could indulge me with some information about Mr. Walter firestone, the late Walter firestone? I would greatly appreciate it. I've already spoken with one of your people, I believe her name is sergeant peckham? I don't know what more I can offer. Well, perhaps you can offer me the same. Needless to say, the entire church is still in an absolute state of shock. I take it he was well-liked. Cherished. You know, it's difficult to imagine, no, impossible to conceive how he was ever coerced into such a compromising situation, a situation so... Fatal? Well, that depends entirely on your beliefs. People do succumb to the sins of the earth. Are you familiar with those? The sins of the earth? Only as a student. Tell me father, did Mr. firestone belong to any church group? He worked full time for the church until, oh, 10 years ago. In what capacity? Several, for the most part however, he was in charge of our foreign missions. Foreign missions? He made the final decisions as to where schools would be built, and he was also responsible for the hiring and the signing of church members, lay people, to act as missionaries and teachers. These missionaries, are they mostly from the L.A. area? Oh no, they came from all over the country. Alright, let's see what I remember from human anatomy. Oh, well, well, well, if I'm not mistaken that's a fracture, and so is that. Yeah, there's another one there. What the hell's going on, I thought you said she was just bruised up when you got her. Come on, David, these fractures happened when she was a kid, 10, 12 years old. - I know. - Yeah, I can tell you know. Doc, that's another one right there. What are you getting at, why the sudden interest? Just curious. Her memory ever come back? - Nope. - Nothing? - As far as I know. - How about the nightmares? Nightmares. You know what, that information will cost you a drink. It's very interesting. Do me a favor doc, don't analyze me, you're off duty. You know what I think you should do? I think you should see her again. And why is that? David, you're missing a golden opportunity here. Man, I hate it when you get brainstorms. - Remember the ex-wife? - Yes, vaguely. Remember how she didn't turn out quite the way you wanted her to? Yes, and? Well, clean slate, you start from square one and you, you, make the perfect woman. No history, no baggage. My very own personal Stepford wife, huh? Absolutely, men would die for this opportunity. Oh doc, you belong at the other side of the desk. Yeah, you're right, you're absolutely right. I forgot that you already have the perfect relationship with Ms. peckham, don't you? Thanks. Dr. hoogstraten. David, please, remember? This is for you. Thank you. So how'd you find me? Friends at the police department. Why, are you hiding? No, just trying to get my life back together. Mmhmm. Felicity, this place, look around. Does it mean anything to you, some of the art, the designs? I don't understand. Forget it, I'm sorry, I'm just... I saw your x-rays. From the hospital. Why? It looked like you had several broken bones when you were a little girl. Anything? I'm sorry. Can we talk about something else? Sure, sure. Well, how about this? You know what these are, huh? One for you, you ever done this? This could be fun, also maybe a little insightful. Open yours. True love is much closer than you may realize. 000. Do yours. And the winner is, oh, this has never happened. - [T's the same as mine. - Mmhmm, I don't know what that means. Still mad at me? Never was. How's that case of yours coming? Oh, dead end. Sorry, bad pun. Blonde pubic hair on an oriental guy, huh? Yup, sorry about your theory. I'll get over it. Still might be in the ballpark though. Yeah, how's that? No reason she couldn't be a Caucasian, maybe lived in the far east, - or worked there. - Or anything, right? Oh, well that doesn't sound very enthusiastic. Now what's wrong? Decided to take your advice, stick to my job, let you guys do yours. Homicide, Benson. Roger, David. Listen, I need you to do me a favor. Anything for the good doctor. - Good, is your computer on? - Computer never sleeps. Alright, will you punch in sun wang? The Rambo guy who just got whacked? Yes. I love your choice of words, Roger. Why the interest? Research. Very nicely done, Hank. Thanks very much. Yum. Hey, what are you doing here? Instant heart attack, right? - I'm gonna tell. - Maybe, I didn't think you were on 'til tomorrow. Why not? Just came down here to, I don't know, I was gonna ask you to let me see the file on - Felicity? - Felicity yeah. David, I can't do that. You know patient confidentiality rules - as well as I do. - Oh come on, it doesn't apply here. You asked me to consult. I asked you to consult when she was a ward of the state. She's a civilian now, all bets are off. Look, I can help her. I mean, there's gotta be something in her file, just a little something we could find. Why do you sound so desperate? I'm not desperate, I just feel like I can help her. Alright, slow down. What if I was to do this? Don't you think we may be crossing the professional line here? For Pete's sake, I'm just trying to follow something that I'm involved in. David, listen to me. Maybe this went over your head. The other night in my office when we were talking about Felicity being the ideal woman, you remember that. - Yes. - The Stepford wife, that's what you called her. That was a joke. I'm familiar with your humor. Well good, then you're familiar with when I'm serious then also, and right now I'm serious, leave it alone. - Leave what alone? - David, don't dance with me, what are we doing here? We've known each other too long, I don't wanna see you jeopardize anything, now is that clear? Yes? Yes, you're right. Leave it alone. I'm outta line. I'll see you tomorrow, I'm sorry. Oh rodger, let me have the flower, you know that's not for eating dear. Come on, I'll give you some nice cookies. Come on now, you know with raisins, the chocolate chips, the ones you like. Hi, I'm Dr. hoodstraten. I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time. Of course doctor, what can I do for you? Well, do you possibly remember a patient you had here a while ago? I'll try, I can't make any promises. Her name was Felicity. In fact, I think you even... Yes, I remember Felicity, oh, wonderful child, but so lost, so all alone. Good, good, good. Let me ask you something, did you teach her how to arrange flowers? Oh, heavens no, she taught me. - Really? - Have you seen her or talked with her? Yes. How's she doing? Oh, such a nice girl. Yes, she is, and she's doing fine. Look, the reason I'm here is I was wondering if you could recollect anything she may have said while she was here, out of context, possibly in one of her nightmares, that would relate to her past, - to her childhood? - Not really, I wish I could. Are you and Dr. lob still treating her? Yes, in a manner of speaking. Oh, that's good. How about any distinctive marks? Birth marks? Yes, maybe, something that could be - traceable? - Now that you mention it, one time, when she first came here, she was taking a shower, got real confused, disoriented, started to cry. I ran in with a towel to try to calm her down, we do that a lot around here. Well, she had a Mark on her thigh, it was way up. I didn't say anything, I didn't wanna embarrass her, poor child. Do you remember what the Mark looked like? - No. - No, sorry. Will you take a look at this? Is that anything like it? Yes. Dr. hoogstraten. Professor huan, nice of you to see me on such short notice, thank you. I see that you're with the police department? Yeah, I'm a psychologist. What can I do for you, doctor? Well, I was hoping you could tell me the meaning of this drawing here. Where did you see this? I can't tell you, it's part of an ongoing homicide investigation. Just, could you tell me what it means? It's the Mark of the virgin. The virgin? I was born here, doctor, but my mother remembers when her mother was forced to sell her younger sister because they had nothing to eat. What, into slavery? I know it may seem cruel to the occidental mind, but being a concubine was far better than dying from a swollen stomach. When my mother saw her sister again 10 years later, she was a consort to a rich merchant. The snapdragon tattooed on her upper thigh was put there when she was 9 years old to prove that she was pure. Like branding a steer. I don't think it's anyone's fault for wanting to survive. I suppose you'll want to see the dragon's tongue. What, the dragon's tongue? You've researched the gliff and not the tongue? I'll loan you this for two days only. If you could kindly return it undamaged, - it's quite rare. - Absolutely. You may not like what you read. I'll take my chances. Oh yeah, that's it. The emperor's harem bore the Mark 6,000 years ago, they were the only ones allowed to use the dragon's tongue, bingo. The concubines hid it under their tongues, and then slit the throats of the emperor's enemies, whom they would seduce for information, yow, Jesus. Uh uh, sorry. - It's okay. - No, it's not. Yeah, it is. Hey, don't worry about it, happens to everybody. Not to me, you know that. Well, you just joined a big club. I'm canceling my membership. Oh, what are you celebrating? Joys of growing old. Oh please, you're a virile stud muffin, okay, it's no big deal, you're just probably preoccupied right now, - that's all it is. - Sure. With what? Office, I suppose, too many screwed up cops, too little time. - I can relate to both. - Really? I'm sure, why don't you tell us about your case, huh? I thought you were gonna stick to doing your own job. Oh yes, I forgot, I'm sorry, sorry, - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry, forgive me? Yes, you're forgiven. It's just this thing's got me up against the wall, and if something doesn't break soon they're probably gonna send me back to vice. Oh great, that's your favorite place. There just has to be a connection between these victims, - there's just gotta be. - Not necessarily. Look, you know what, that's what everybody's saying, but I feel it in my gut that I'm right. Oh, well then you're probably right. As they used to tell us in psych 101, go with your instincts, babe. Okay, this first guy, he's over 60, businessman, practically a religious fanatic, second guy, he's a stud, no offense. None taken. Um, he spends all of his discretionary income on prostitutes, and then this third guy, he's some Chinese dude who sells flowers. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm the one who's nuts around here. What do you think, doc? Like I said, I'm out of it, don't ask me. Yeah, nice catch, good hands. See, hands, concentration, it's all a matter of concentration. And throwing is all in the wrist, remember that. What? What, does that remind you of something? What's going on? Okay, what, this remind you of something? Like what? Like the feeling of another place? Another time long ago, childhood? Memories of mountains? Ocean? I thought this was gonna be a fun day. Tis, it still is. We're gonna have fun. One last lonely dog, who wants it? Not me. - Come on. - Oh, it'll make me fat. Oh, yes, sure, I doubt it. I wonder if I ever was. - What, fat? - Yeah. Like I said, not a chance. Did you have a good time tonight? - Yeah. - Me too, really good. I wanted to try something, although you probably tried it with Bernie, oh nevermind, here. - The pictures. - Yeah. And see if I can remember. Wanna give it a shot? I'm sorry. It's okay, it's alright, no big deal. David? Do you think that maybe before all of this I could've been a bad person? - I mean, a really bad person? - No, not you. Vice. What? - Yeah, Dr. hoogstraten. - There's been another one, I need your help. - What? - Hoog, are you awake? Yeah, I'm okay, where'd it happen? Holiday lodge motel in El dorado. Yeah, I know where that is, I'll see you soon, okay? All through? I came by your place last night. Yeah, I was with a patient. After midnight? Oh come on, is that what this is about? Is that why you're calling my house at 2:30 in the morning, to find out where the hell I am? No. No, I, I... I don't know why I called. You okay, babe? I don't know what I am, this thing is just, this is making me crazy, it's like she's inside of me. Oh boy, I don't know if I can do this. Sure you can. You're a good cop. Go get 'em. You okay? Have you been here all night? Well, why don't we go inside, huh? Wanna come inside? Come on, alright? This is for you, careful, it's hot. Thank you. So you feel better, a little bit? You feel like talking? I think so. Good. So you had another nightmare. The worst one, it wasn't like the others. Parts of it were more clear, it was terrible. Tell me about it. - It's embarrassing. - I understand. I was with a man in a bedroom. Did you recognize him? No. Then the blood. Felicity. Felicity. You know that because of the recurrence of these dreams, and the fact they are becoming clearer and clearer, it's quite possible that you're re-experiencing something that happened before you lost your memory, possibly even something you witnessed, do you understand? I don't know, I'm not sure I wanna know. You're really good with flowers, aren't you? What do you see? I don't know. Tell me. Images. Colors. Okay, that's your memory struggling to come back. - It will. - I can't, I'm sorry. Okay, here. I'm sorry, I'm imposing. Don't be silly, come on. There you go, see? You'll be safe here. I'll be right down the hall where you saw, and we'll talk later, okay? God knows we both need some sleep. Anyway, goodnight. You know, no one's ever been this nice to me before. How would you know? Help, help, help! No, no. No. - No, no! - Hey, it's okay, it's alright, it's okay, it's alright, it's me, it's David. You were just dreaming, you were just dreaming. Do you know where you are? Alright, I'm gonna let you go now. Try to sit up. There you go, there you go, that was a bad dream. Do you remember what it what, what was going on? They were trying to hurt me. They were? Did you see their faces? Who was it, you know, you don't know? Don't remember? - I really think I should go. - Wait, no, please don't go, don't run away from this. It's not gonna go away by itself. - Please. - David please, - I have to leave. - Please, please, please, please, please. Felicity... Wonderful. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't go anywhere. Hey, hey, it's not, wait a minute! Hey! She didn't call or nothing? Nope, I tried to call her but she didn't answer. Kinda hard to figure, I mean she's never been late or anything, ever since she first started working here. Come on, you don't have any idea where she might be now? Not one. I don't understand how the police department can order me to come and see you... Wait a minute you can't go in there, I'm sorry, I tried to stop her, but she pushed past me anyway. Officer green, excuse us for a minute, Sylvia, it's okay. I'm sorry, I forgot I had an appointment with detective peckham. See you later. Have a seat? No. Well, I'm gonna sit down if you don't mind. Peck, we don't have exclusive by each other, you know that, I mean, we never have. I can live with that, this I can't. What is it? I think you know what it is, and I also think you know what that is, don't you? Isn't this cute, doc? It seems an old friend of yours, a professor huan from the humanities department at ucla gave us a call. Uh huh, she was actually looking for you, but when she mentioned something about an ongoing homicide investigation the call was referred to me, - how's that for coincidence? - Okay, well, - there's... - Don't say a word, it would probably be a lie, and it just might be used against you in a court of law. - Oh, come on. - Do you know what you get for withholding information in a capital crime? You wanna tell me what the fuck's going on? I'm sorry. That helps a whole hell of a lot. Let's go, and don't say a word unless I tell you to. - Hey peck? - Let's go. I can't believe you didn't tell me. - Sorry. - Yeah, you already said that. What are you, carrying on your own investigation, all of a sudden you're dirty Harry? Hey, I think I'm involved. Funny way to show it. Okay, this last victim was a pimp, ran oriental women mostly, worked outta one of these dives. I think we might be close to something. So why am I here? You wanna be a cop, I'm gonna show you what it's like. Besides, I'm not gonna let you out of my sight until I know what you know, all of it. I'm sergeant peckham, LAPD, I'd like to speak to your manager, or... Sergeant peckham, LAPD, and you would be? I am hua. You know this man? - Never seen before. - He's dead, you know that? Never seen before. We have pretty good information that he ran a call girl operation right outta here. No girls, just mahjong. What are they, nieces? Waiting for tables. - Ever seen... - Rumor has it that your boy here actually owns some of the talent who work for him, bought burnt-out hookers from the orient and brought them back here, but you wouldn't know about that, would you? Looks like you're violating some health codes. Oh, and some fire codes, and no doubt some liquor codes, you interested in staying in business? Have a good day. The first guy sent missionaries all over the world, but mostly the far east. The second guy lived for hookers, mostly oriental. The flower guy, Felicity's friend, the pimp actually owned people, had them brought here from... That's it. - You better take this. - Yeah, this is Deb. I'll be happy to tell him. Alright, alright yes. Hey man, it's me, David, where you at man? Hey, you there? Listen, you're not gonna believe this, I figured it out. Felicity is a Sybil, man. Listen, she's doing the murders except she doesn't know. I don't know how I didn't figure it out before, but I'm really gonna need your help on this, buddy, huh? Listen, um, what... Oh, oh, shit! Oh man.. Oh no, no, no! Not you, not you, not you. Oh god! I just came from Bernie's office, I'm sorry, really sorry. Yeah, it was my fault, I'm responsible. It's nobody's fault. I could've won, I know who did it, I was just too wrapped up... It's not your fault, it's not your fault. We did it. We did it. Her name is Felicity, except it's not her real name. A nurse gave it to her. She has amnesia, you see, she was a patient of Bernie's, and then he asked me to help, so she came to see me after she was released, and we became friends, so to speak. While I was here that day. Yeah, she has a severe split personality, only I was too stupid to see it. You know it all don't you? - Mmhmm. - You did all the research - I asked you to? - Oh yeah, yeah. Parents were missionaries, sent to the orient about 20 years ago, sent by a man named firestone. Jesus. And then they were killed, she probably saw it happen while she was being kidnapped, and then she was sold, sold into a life. I know, I know. How could people do that, how could people do that? You know where she lives, don't you? - Oh, yeah. - You're gonna show me. Yeah peck, only you, okay? Please, at least the first time, - please. - That's fine. It's not here, nine, there, 12. I've never been inside, I swear to god. I believe you. You okay? Yeah. Will you tell me the rest of it? It's all a guess. That's what life's about. Well, she was sold again, probably to that pimp downtown, he brought her over. Why the flower guy? Why? Because, on purpose, she's leaving a trail, she wants to get caught. David. Yeah, see, she wants to be stopped, see, she wants it to be all over finally, just over. And Bernie? So what are you gonna do now? I need to get some guys down here. - That's a good idea. - And you? Me? I'm gonna go to the morgue and be with Bernie. Yeah, well you take care of yourself. I'll let you know. Thank you. Hey, good luck, okay? I've been waiting for you, David. I knew you'd come, the matchbook. Just stay right there. - Don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid, you should be afraid. 'Cause you love me? Because I understand you. I did understand you, until, Bernie. Why Bernie? I understand all the others, I just can't... Why him? They don't matter, all that matters is you and me. I know it's not you, I know it's not you doing this. Make love to me. I wanna know about the snapdragon, tell me. Who told you about that? Felicity. No, she wouldn't. She wouldn't, huh? - She was sworn to silence. - By whom? The woman who ran the mahjong place, right? Her? Right, her? Just tell me. Why are you asking me so many questions? What are you so afraid of? Who's gonna hurt you? No one's gonna hurt you, no one's gonna hurt you. - What? - Make love to me. Hey! Thanks Mike, I can handle it from here. - Cute David, real cute. - Hey, it's not what it seems. What do you have a death wish or something? Please, it's not the best day - of my life. - Hey, fuck you and your best day! It's a wonder you're not lying there with a black silk cloth over your eyes. How'd you know where I was? Well when you didn't show up at the morgue after three hours, I put an apb out on your car. I got lucky, sometimes it works. Oh, this is great, this is great. Okay, where is she, lover, huh? No more games. I swear to god, I don't know. Don't give me that crap, you know damn well where she is. She left you alive for a reason. I don't know. Nice. Beautiful. Yeah. I want you to know something. I never wanted any of this, any of it. See, contrary to what you guys thought my life was just fine before I got brought into this bizarre business. So now my doing favors for friends has ended up costing me Bernie, you, And now somebody... What's the fucking point? And now what? I'm supposed to feel sorry for you? I don't think so. I'll tell you what doc, I think you're sick, and you need help, a lot of it. - Why don't you... - No, don't start, I don't wanna get into it, and I have a job to do. I'll leave you to wallow in your own misery. No more trouble, you leave now! Please, where is she? Enough death, you go away. Look, I just wanna... - Hey, hey! - Please go, it's too dangerous. Look, I'm going up okay, I'm sorry. Felicity, I know that's not your name. Look, I don't know what's going on here, but I'm here to help you, that's all, alright? I'll get you outta here, we'll start over, you don't have to tell me anything, okay? I'll just help. You should've stayed out of it, David. You think you're so smart. What? Do you know what this is? Who are you? - Why are you doing this? - Because it has to be done. Come on, it doesn't have to be this way, we can fix things. Can we, David? I was wrong. Recognize this? You should, it's yours from your Jeep at the motel room. This time I'm gonna do it right. You tried to kill your sister. You pushed her off the cliff at the beach. She tried to leave me. She actually wanted to get away from me. It'll never work. They'll think she tried to kill you, like she killed the others, so you shot her. It'll work. You're nuts. We shared everything, even our dreams, our thoughts. You had to spoil it, just like you spoil everything. No! How'd you know? I followed you. Rule number one, never trust anybody who's in love. No, how'd you know which one to shoot? It didn't matter to me. Alright. You sure you don't want me to stay with you tonight? No, I think I need to spend some time by myself. Okay, okay. Anyway, you have my number, right? Hey, tomorrow start over, right? Brand new life. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah? Well. Okay, I better go now, I need my jacket. I'll see you.
