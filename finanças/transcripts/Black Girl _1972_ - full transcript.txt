And Billie Jean ain't doing nothing. I don't mind. Besides, Rosie wants Billie Jean to tend to her books on the weekends. What books? That loud music playing in her room the past two months ain't been coming out no books. Maybe she can study with the music on. That's right. You know you done quit school. Done quit school? Billie Jean, you mean you been leaving here every morning with your books like you was going to school, and you ain't been going? You see, she can't say nothing 'cause she know it's true. My lord, my lord. There ain't no use you throwing things around like you mad at me. What are you gonna do when Rosie finds out about it? Lord have mercy, y'all get mad when Rosie takes on about netta so. Maybe reason why she does 'cause neither one of y'all don't want to get nothing in your own heads! Norma! I asked you and Ruth Ann to keep them children out of my room. They done broke my record. Girl, don't be hollering at me about them breaking no record. They told you they didn't break the record. Like they didn't tear the picture of that dancer off my wall! Now, the way you be kicking your legs all out when you doing that ballet-dancing stuff, you could've broke it yourself. It ain't no ballet dancing. That's what it look like to me. The record was inside the cover. Funny it happened to be the one I was practicing my dancing with. Girl, them children, they can't even read. How they gonna pick out some old record you was dancing to? Maybe they had some help. I know you ain't accusing me of breaking no record! You better not be accusing me. Y'all got my uniform ready? Norma: She could've had it ready by now. What is going on in here? She's starting some old mess about a damn record. Somebody broke the record I been practicing my dancing with. I don't wanna hear nothing about no darn dancing. I told you that mess you doing ain't nothing. What the devil you keep on carrying on about it for? Norma fay, why don't you and Ruth Ann make Billie Jean get on with her schoolwork? Then she wouldn't have time to be popping her tail. Ain't no schoolwork to get 'cause Billie Jean done quit. Billie Jean, you mean to tell me you done quit school? This teacher was picking on me, mama. What teacher? And don't stand there and lie to me! I'm not lying. Then how come you didn't come and tell me about it? There's something else to this. I'm going up to that school and find out what it is. She thinks she's grown. You can't tell her nothing! If I wasn't already halfway late to work... Get out of my face! If it wasn't for my netta... Lord, I don't know what I'd do. And if I had just one of you to follow her example... Ruth Ann, hurry up with my dress! No. No, you go. No, you go. No, you go. You go. Aah! Both: Want to buy some mother's day flowers? Y'all ain't never gonna sell nothing like that. Ruth Ann, out here selling mother's day flowers. Mother's day? Damn, it almost is mother's day, ain't it? Bring 'em up here, y'all, so I can see 'em! Fay, wanna buy some mother's day flowers? How much is they? A quarter. A quarter for the whole box? Both: No, ma'am. A quarter a piece. A quarter a piece?! I almost forgot mother's day was right around the corner. Ruth Ann, zip me. A quarter for these little bitty things? Both: Yes, ma'am. Ruth Ann: Hey, fay, look. Look at the wild woman, will ya? How you expect she got way down here by herself? You watch it. One of these days, she's gonna walk in front of a car and get killed. If y'all don't wanna buy none of these, say so and let these children go on. Don't keep picking all over 'em. Mama, look. I don't know why the city don't do something and put that woman away before she hurt somebody. That's what I said. Y'all's mother make these? Yes, ma'am. You tell her they mighty little to be costing a quarter, but we gonna help out, anyway. Pay 'em, Ruth Ann. Ruth Ann? Ain't this something? Norma fay, you sure a letter didn't come for me from netta? Mama, I am not the mailman. And I already told you no. All right. [ Telephone rings ] Hey, this you, netta? Mama Rosie! Is anything the matter? Guess I was a little worried about you. Something come to me in a dream I wouldn't see you no more. I done told you about those dreams. I can't remember one yet I had about you didn't come true. Seems like you want me to worry about you. But how can you say that? Is it the money? You know I'll scrape up some kind of change to send you. No, ma'am, it's not that. I got enough saved up to come. You act like you don't wanna see me no more. Now, you know that's not true. I didn't say nothing when you didn't come home for Christmas. I didn't say nothing when you didn't come home for Thanksgiving. I ain't gonna stand not seeing you for mother's day. I didn't know whether or not you'd be up to having company, mama Rosie. Company? Darling, you ain't no company. This is your family and your home. Ain't no need of you staying in no empty college like you ain't got no home to come to. Now you come on home, you hear me? Well, I'll write and let you know. Yes, ma'am. I promise I'll try to come. And you let me know if you're gonna fly or take a bus. I'll have Mr. Herbert drive me to meet you. I'll know within two days. Okay...you take care, too. Bye. [ Dance music plays ] [ Knock on door ] [ Knock knock knock ] What y'all want? We want some water. How many times I tell you to go through mu'dear's room or get water out of the bathroom? I don't want no toilet water! Then drink it out of the ditch! Girl, you get out of here. I'm gonna tell big mama. The next time your mama leave you here with me, boy, I'm gonna beat your ass! Mama said tell her next time you beat me. You tell her with your own nappy-headed self and you better not bring your butt back in here! [ Pounding on door ] Mu'dear: Open up this door, child. Why don't you let these children get their water? And stop scaring them all the time. I ain't scaring them. They pass through my room all day long, and they don't be wanting nothing out of that kitchen. How do you know they don't be wanting nothing? I know they don't be wanting nothing. Mama's put them up to running back and forth through here. What is this mess lately about somebody picking on you all the time? You gonna lose your mind, locked up every day like this. That's right. I'm losing my mind. It's just my imagination that when Norma and Ruth Ann was living here, they'd keep their things all over this room. They can't stand to see me have this room to myself, but I'm losing my mind 'cause I see through all that mess. That's right, miss Billie Jean. Just make a joke out of everything that I say. You know, you ain't gonna get very far disrespecting your parents and your grandparents. Hey, how y'all doing? Hey, Herbert. At least you could've knocked, Mr. Herbert. Now you listen here. I am not gonna stand for this mess. I am just not gonna stand for it! I wasn't talking to you. What's the trouble here? I'm gonna tell Rosie she better do something with this child. You hear me? 'Cause I don't play with children. Open this door, girl! Ain't I told you to keep this door open? Now open that other door! Mama, sometimes I be in here undressing, Mr. Herbert walk in here without even knocking. You don't be undressing all the time you keep these doors locked. Who you think you're talking to? Besides, Mr. Herbert seen plenty kinds of whatever you trying to hide. If Mr. Herbert was married to mu'dear, that'd be different. But he ain't no kin to nobody in this house. That ain't none of your business. As far as you're concerned, Mr. Herbert pay half the rent on this house, and he's a roomer. How come he ain't got no room to hisself? That ain't none of your business who my mama has in her room. You keep your trap shut or get out and get a place. Mighty funny when netta's mama went crazy and she didn't have no place to stay, you opened your big heart and welcomed her, but i-- because netta's got sense enough to stay in school and get something in her head instead of her tail. You ugly bastards! Do you want me to get a stick and beat all the black off of you? You must've forgot what a good beating feel like. You better snap out of whatever's on your mind! Don't you roll your eyes at me. This ain't dear you're playing with, you understand? Yes, ma'am. I wasn't rolling my eyes at you. Dear better not come and tell me you sassed her or Herbert, or it's gonna be woe be unto you. Billie Jean, what'd you call my baby? He was sticking his tongue out at me. That don't give you no right to call him no bastard. A bastard is a child that ain't got no daddy, and my child got a daddy! She's smelling her piss, that's all. You're getting out of this house tomorrow and finding a job. She's already got a job, mama. Already got one? Where? At the groovy bar and grill down at second ward. At the groovy bar and grill? Doing what? Doing that ballet dancing. It ain't no ballet dancing. P-a-l-l-e-t is pallet, ain't it? B-a-l-l-e-t gots to be ballet. It ain't even that kind of dancing. Have you started this mess yet? I just work three nights. How come just now I'm hearing about it? I thought she had done told you about it. It's a job. I didn't see no reason for her to be hiding no job unless it's something else she doing. I was gonna tell you. You was gonna tell me. After I got my first week's pay-- you ain't gonna see no week at that place. I don't approve of that dancing mess, no how. And shaking your tail at the groovy grill, of all places. I didn't raise none of y'all like that. That man don't wanna be looking at no ballet dancing. They wanna see some striptee, baby. How much is you getting for this mess? $3 a night, mama. $3 a night. But I get tips, mama. Tips! I don't care how many tips you get. You dip your ass over there sometime today and get what that man owes you. I better not ever hear of you going in no place like that unless you got a husband to take you. That truant officer walk in there, you out of school and under 18, you'll get carried right off to reform school. They'll make me pay a fine. Mama! What?! Daddy just drove up. You kidding. No, I ain't kidding. Look at that nice car. I'd like to ride in that. I'm gonna drive in it. What is it? Don't you tell him I'm here. Jive-ass bastard. Mu'dear, Mr. Herbert... Cheryl Ann and Earl, come and look at your grandpa. Ooh-ee! Man, this sure is a pretty car. It's gonna stay that way. Don't be getting too close to it. Why don't you go play over yonder somewhere? Can I wash it for you, mister? Y'all done learned to hustle young. Come along, get back. Come on. See you. Hey! Both: Daddy! Daddy! Ooh, daddy. This thing is worth a lot. You're talking my language, man. Hey, girls, come on. Lay something on me. Daddy, you're a sight to see, I mean... You ain't seen nothing yet. I didn't wanna mess up these little old country boy's minds on the first day. You're gonna make mama's eyes pop out. Hey, young blood, come on, watch the car. Don't be letting nobody get all on it, you hear? I won't let them get on it, mister. All right. Come on, let's go. Oh, lord, there's my boy. How you doing? You sure look well. Hey, dear. You sure smell good as home. Hey, what's going on, Herbert? Nothing, Earl. Same old thing. Working hard. Come on, gimme five. Ruth Ann: Mr. Herbert, come see this view. Man, I thought you'd have been done left this town. What would I wanna leave it for if I like it? Honey, you sure went and did something for yourself. I'm proud of you. But why don't you come to see US more often? As far as I'm concerned, you're still a member of this family. Don't pay no attention to Rosie. You know I ain't scared of your daughter. I'm just a mover. You know me. Oh, lord. Say, who's them? This one's mine, daddy. I named him after you. Didn't your mama write you that you had grandchildren? Sure, she did 'cause I was over to big mama's house the day she wrote the letter. Earl, you and Cheryl go hug your grandpa's neck. Now look, don't y'all be calling me no grandpa. And what the hell else are they supposed to call you? Oh, lord. Now, me and you ain't gonna get in no fights before we even say hello, is we, Rosie? What you driving? A Mr. El dorado, mama. You bring me any money? Now, Rosie, why can't you be nice? How come I ain't being nice? I ain't cussed you out...Yet. Girl, you ain't changed a bit. Doing all right for yourself, ain't you, Earl? Daddy, let me have the keys. Me and Ruth Ann wanna take US a little spin. No, not in my car, you ain't. Oh, daddy, come on. Now get out the way, Norma fay. Don't be jerking your hands in my pockets. Children, y'all give your daddy a chance to sit down and rest. He just got in the door. Before you know it, he'll be back out the door. We won't see him again. Norma fay, get the money. Wait, don't be wrinkling my suit. Don't be digging your hands in my pockets. You'll stretch the pants. Get back. Come on. Y'all stretchin' the pants. How do you get the money out of there, then? I'll show you. Just, please, come on, get back. You know I'm gonna give y'all money. Right now! Good lord. You the begging-est woman I ever seen in my life. Always got your hand out. How is anybody supposed to know we need something? Ooh, daddy. Y'all, I see a 1 with two 0s behind it. Now give 'em room to breathe. Come on. Lord have mercy. She got it first. Let mama hold that for you till you get old enough. Y'all go on outside and play. Go on. Billie Jean, come on out and get some of this money. I ain't giving every niggah's kid in the neighborhood some of this money. What the hell you mean, every niggah's kid? I know you know who Billie Jean's daddy is. I know you ain't intending to come into this house, give everybody some money, and ain't giving Billie Jean none. I'm letting her wear my name. Ain't that enough? You can have it back anytime you want it. Well, looky there. I didn't ask you to come out here and act smart. Time you growed up and got fine. When's the last time you seen your old, no-good daddy? Chickenshit bastard better not bring his tail around here again. I heard he was telling people Billie Jean wasn't his'n. Up his mammy's ass with a flagpole. I ought to know who Billie Jean's daddy is. Rosie, don't. What is he trying to say about me, dear? See? When you had me, you wouldn't treat me right. 'Cause you wouldn't act right. Wouldn't act right? Dig this girl, will ya, dear? Didn't she have a roof over her head, and did these children ever want for anything? They sure didn't want for nothing. Well, mama, I wanted for something. That was your trouble. You was never satisfied. You wanna style big, I know. But if you had just had a little Patience... Come on, get your money. That's all right. I don't want no money. Girl, are you crazy? You better not be turning down no money. You don't want it, you get it and give it to me. I wondered what that voice was kept telling me, "pack your things and git while the getting's good." Now I know. Two rosies under the same roof. Herbert, you sure must have your balls together. What the devil are you talking about? Billie Jean got ways like you. Billie Jean ain't nothing like me. That child over there... She's more like me than anybody I've ever met 'cause she wants something out of life. Who is that? That's my other daughter. The one you don't know about. When did you have this one? You always springing some new kid on me. Is she wearing my name, too? She's too good to wear your name. How come she's too good to wear daddy's name, mama? What's going on here? "To my dear mama Rosie..." Mama Rosie? You can read, can't you? "God will surely bless you for helping so many of US when we needed help." Earl, Rosie didn't tell you, but she's done gone to keeping girls every now and then. First, it was one of Norma and Ruth Ann's friends that didn't have no place to stay. Every stray alley cat in town done found 'em a good thing. Dear, I don't like that. You getting any money for this? I don't want no money for it. Let me get this straight-- you just gives a girl a home who ain't got no home just out of the goodness of your heart? I love those girls like they was my own daughters. Norma fay and Ruth Ann and Billie Jean wasn't enough for you. They don't appreciate me like them other girls do. Maybe if you would appreciate US more, mama. What is there to appreciate? I don't see none of y'all's graduation pictures up there. You and Ruth Ann couldn't keep your dresses down. Y'all got caught, huh? Yeah, they got caught. The way Billie Jean like to shake her tail, she's next. I don't put no faith in none of them no more. But my girl netta-- she's gonna pull me through. When she get her diploma, she gonna come back and teach. What is so big about a teacher, mama? You go into some white woman's kitchen, you liable to find one working there. What is the sense in spending all that time in some fancy college just to come out and work in a kitchen? That ain't gonna happen to my netta. How do you know that? I know. Because she's smart, that's why. She done won all kinds of awards and scholarships, and they can't mess with you when you're smart! A spiritualist told me that a child that was mine was gonna make me happy one day. Now, you can groan all you want, but I don't see none of y'all helping me get nothing. All Billie Jean got on her mind is that dancing mess. Dancing? Yeah, daddy. She do that ballet-dancing stuff. You know, where you kick your legs all out, and you have your arms flopping like chicken wings. You know, like the white folks do. Is that what you wanna do, Billie Jean? It's paying her $3 a night at the groovy bar and grill. At the groovy and two? You doing that kind of dancing at the groovy and second ward? What you talking about, man? She's the star dancer. Damn, what is them niggahs drinking out there? Rosie: They just had her doing that crazy dance for fun. They were switching her to the striptee next. Well, tell me something... Even at that, $3 a night... You'd get more than that picking cotton. Baby, if you wanna use what your mama gave you that bad, come on back to Detroit with me, I'll show you how to get your ph.D. In the funky chicken, and I guarantee that'll sell when cotton won't. Look, Earl, you know better than to talk like that with dear sitting here. You respect her, and I mean that. Herbert, dear ain't no virgin. I got enough sense to know that. But that ain't the point. I don't care what he do out in them streets, he ain't got no business coming in here, talking like that in front of these women. Hell, everybody in here's married, except Billie Jean. From what I just heard she's sneaking and doing, she may be in motherhood this very minute. And even if she ain't yet, at least Earl'll take her where she won't be disgracing this family. Can't nobody disgrace nothing that's already a disgrace. What the hell are you trying to say? If you don't like this family, ain't nobody holding you in it! Hold on before you say something you'll be sorry for. If I say it, I ain't sorry. Herbert knows I don't play that shit. I wouldn't let no man talk like that in front of daughters of mine. Look, you skin your cat, and I'll skin mine! Hell, I was just trying to help. I got somebody who can help me get all that I want. Now don't you worry about it. I got netta! All right, Rosie. Hey, get off my car! Oh, daddy, come on. Mama, daddy fixing to leave! Wait a minute, e.P. Gimme a ride to work. You gonna drive this car, or you wanna let me drive? If I'd knowed you was gonna drive around here stylin', I'd have took a bus. Girl, you want me to let you out at the corner? No kidding, e.P. I want you to come by for mother's day 'cause my other daughter might be coming home, and I want you to meet her. Rosie, I don't wanna meet no more of your daughters. You ought to want to meet her so you can see what your daughters didn't make out of theyselves. That bitch ain't staying in this house. How you gonna stop her? You don't live here no more. I said she wasn't staying in this house! Well, I ain't deaf. Rosie: Let me see that watch. You better not make me late. Earl: What you being so faithful for? You gonna get a raise or a promotion or something? Raise or promotion nothing. There's more teachers seen me there for years pass me in the hall and don't even speak. That's why I want my girl netta to teach here when she get her diploma. I'm gonna sit in on her classes when I finish my work, too. Oh, e.P., I know I can learn it. I've watched her helping Billie Jean with her schoolwork. I'm telling you, she's got so much Patience. Rosie, I didn't know you wanted an education. Yeah...i always wanted one. Why don't you let me send you to night school? I don't want it for myself no more. As long as my girl netta gets hers, I'll have mine. Rosie, come on, take the day off. We going to the park and watching ducks in the lake. Is you crazy? These people seen me in this car. No, they ain't seen you. I'll call and tell 'em you don't feel well. I know you better unjack this thing and let me out. Ain't nobody seen you except the kids, and they ain't gonna say nothing. You trying to make that old devil make me do something, and I ain't gonna listen to him. Come on, girl. Remember how I used to lift you over that fence, and we'd just run like jackrabbits from one end of the field to the other. You remember the time I outran you? You mean the time I had that bad ankle. Bad ankle my foot. Every time I'd win at something, you'd lay it on your bad ankle. Wanna try again? Come on. On your Mark...Come on... Get set... Go! I don't know... You coming back to Detroit with me, or you want me to come back here? For what? Oh, don't beat a player crazy. You know what I'm talking about. You think I'm gonna get bit by the same dog twice? Damn. I got an elephant on my hands. 18 years, and you still remember. The bitch didn't mean nothing. That's what's so killing. How did I know she didn't mean nothing? You don't see me with her, do you? Maybe she didn't want you. Shit. You know better than that. You wouldn't have went up down her job and threatened to whip her ass if you thought she didn't want me. Who told you that lie? That's all right. I heard all about it. Whoever told you is a bare-faced liar 'cause you ain't never seen me showing my behind in public. I got too many other ways to get even with her. Is that what you was trying when you married Billie Jean's daddy? That had nothing to do with getting even. What'd it have to do with, then? I dare you to say you felt something for him. I did feel something for him. Where'd you feel it at? Where do you think I felt it at? Shit. You know I'm the only man ever got next to you. You think so? If my life depended on you admitting it, I'd be a dead son of a bitch 'cause you ain't gonna admit nothing like that. E.p., how are all them girls in Detroit getting along with you down here? Now that you mention it, I was thinking, since you like to keep girls, I'd round up all them funky bitches and bring 'em down here to you. If you stop playing with me, I'll stop playing with you. Rosie... You know I ain't happy doing that stuff. I'm a one-woman man, and you know it. What do you want with me? You know what we had going between US. Humph. I ain't going for that. What was wrong with it? You still trying to get revenge? I ain't never said I wanted no revenge on you. Then what is it? I never did beat all on you or nothing like some guys do women, never even raised my hand to you. 'Cause you know you better not pull no shit like that, that's why. You're right. You're always right. In fact, you're so right, it seemed I ought to be able to come down sometime and not see you in the same rut, paying rent on that matchbox of a shack where, half the time, you heat your own water before you can wash your face or paying off some loan company where you borrowed money for them kids. Hell, they got they own husbands. Who told you I was borrowing money? Dear? Dear ain't told me nothing. What's the matter with you? I'm trying to understand you. I bet you don't have no trouble understanding them other women you got. Them babes know what they want. And I know what I want, too. What do you want that any man can give you? If you were the man for me, you'd know that. The man for you? The man for you, Rosie? Look, baby, you see this money? Here's $1,000 cash. Go on. Count it. I want to see you go out and find the man for you, and when you find that dude, I don't care where I'm at, let me know, and I'll come wherever you are. I'll not only take off my hat to that bird, I'll eat it, too. This $1,000 is yours, and I'll give him 1,000. Make sure you contact me 'cause I wanna see that bad mutha. Well, you may lose your money and get indigestion to boot. You're the damnedest woman I ever met. Gimme my money. If you was willing to pull with me till I got my shoe business going good, then you could have your home paid for, you wouldn't have to slave no more. But you keep on wearing yourself out doing for somebody else, so go on, keep on letting yourself go. You don't even laugh like you used to. I told you, don't be worrying about me. This is the last time I'm coming to you. The last time. I didn't ask you to come this time. Just as cool as you is, baby. [ Humming ] Hey there. You here? Thought you was going somewhere with Herbert. No, I didn't have to go nowhere with Herbert. He had a Deacon board meeting, but I don't have to go with him. I don't know why them deacons ain't made Herbert quit that board, living in sin with you the way he is. Lord. I could tell the way you come through that door you was aiming to start some dirt. Mama, I'm not trying to start no dirt. It just don't look right, you and Herbert shacking up. There's more folks in the church doing more than Herbert and me. That includes the pastor, too. What kind of example is that to set before Billie Jean? Your girls ain't no babies, and neither is you. It's a sin for a woman as young as you to be walking around here burning. God didn't mean for US to burn like that, you know. Old Herbert done interpreted that Bible to you that way just so's he could get half of your bed. Smarter than I thought he was. Herbert and nobody else don't have to tell me that when it comes to nature. That Bible belongs on the shelf, not myself. I know where you got them ideas from--old auntie. Lord, if I'd have known leaving you with that old woman was gonna make this big a fool of you, I'd have rather gived you away and never seen you again. You come pretty close to doing it as it was, mama. You ain't never gonna forget that, is you? Auntie didn't let me forget it, mama. Morning, noon, and night. "If it wasn't for your mama leaving your daddy, I wouldn't be fooling with you." Oh, sometimes I wish Earl would never come to this town. Mama, what does Earl got to do with this? Oh, Rosie, Rosie. Picking on me ain't gonna wash your feelings away for him. Oh, you talking out of your head, mama. Yeah, that's right. I'm just a dumb old woman talking out of of my head. I don't know nothing. Oh, Rosie... Even that old whale had to let Jonah out of his gut one day. Honey, whatever's holding on to you... You better give it up before it's too late. Rosie, you better give it up. You been down our way yet? Nope. But I'll come if you want me to. You got anything in there for me? You got anything for me? You crazy. Now, how come I gotta be crazy? You better give me my mail from out of there 'fore these people start gossiping. Your sister got anything for me? I told you, you crazy. Boy, I tell you, how y'all expect for Santa claus to bring y'all anything if you gonna act like that? Shit. Get a letter from your boyfriend? Ann! Mmm-mmm-mmm. What you call me for? I want you to come go into Billie Jean's room with me. What for? Just be cool. [ Rock music plays ] Norma: Jean... [ Pounding on door ] Open the door, Jean. You got a place to stay for next year? What? 'Cause if you ain't married by next year, come stay with me. Oh, I would take you, but when the baby comes... I don't know what Johnny gonna say with an extra person. I don't care what Melvin say. If my people can't come there when they out in the cold, then he don't want me there. What y'all talking about? Whatever do you mean, what we talking about? What y'all talking about, a place for me to stay? You know you can't sleep on that couch. Mama don't let nobody sleep on her couch. She ain't heard yet. I told you mama hadn't told her yet. Ain't heard what? Is some other girl coming to live here? No, that's just it. Ain't gonna be no whole lot of different girls no more. Mama said from now on, there just gonna be one certain girl. Mama don't ever tell nobody nothing. She go and do whatever she feel like doing, and everybody's supposed to fall in line. You mean to tell me that mama didn't tell you when your friend get her diploma from that fancy college next year, you gonna have to give up your room? Give up my room. Nah, mama ain't told me that, and that girl ain't none of my friend. I don't see why they both can't stay in here together. But I guess she gonna have to have the whole room. You know all them clothes teachers wear. Changing two and three times a day. Suits in the morning, casual slacks in the afternoon, and cocktail rags at night. Yeah, Jean, I'm afraid she gonna have to have the whole room. Yeah, but the way mama put it, though, she wanted Billie Jean married and off her hands by next year. She didn't wanna see her netta cramped up in this room with another person. Did mama say that? Yeah, that's right. You go ask her so she know we come and told you. I'm sorry I said anything. Wait a minute. I ain't gonna say nothing. What I think is at least mama could have told you. Yet and still, I don't think it's fair... To be kicked out of your room for somebody that ain't even in the family. I ain't giving up my room to nobody. I tried to tell you, three years ago, when you was all friendly with her. "You better watch that girl." I knew then mama had plans for her to come back here and get that room. Oh, no. You wouldn't listen. Now you're being kicked out your room for her. You think I didn't watch her, huh? You think I been secret buddies with her all these years, huh? She come writing me letters when she first left, all chummy and stuff, but I didn't even answer her. I'm tired of hearing that girl's name. Every time I turn around, mama throwing her up to me. "Why don't you follow my netta's example? My netta gonna be teacher this and teacher that." Have y'all ever been with mama when she tell people, "I worked at the school." What is all this bragging she doing about some old ignorant gal coming back to this hole-- to spook the kid-- then trying to make Billie Jean give up her room for her. She ain't getting my room. I'll burn it down 'fore I see her in it. Well...if you feel that way about her, how you gonna stand to stay in the same room with her when she come for mother's day? She coming here for mother's day? Next week sometime, so I heard. I guess mama didn't tell you that either, huh? No, mama ain't told me nothing. Damn. Oh, Ruth Ann, maybe mama was gonna tell her. Maybe mama waiting till she know definite before she tell her. Oh, yeah...Maybe so. All mama said was she called and asked her to come. She won't know nothing definite till the girl write and tell her what day. A letter coming here for mama? I know what to do with her letters when they come here for mama. Well, I'll be damned. Mama ain't read them? No. I didn't like the way she was sounding in 'em, all appreciative. I told you Billie Jean got more sense than she make out. Billie Jean! You is our full-blooded sister now, girl. And I promise you one thing-- that if anybody, and I mean anybody, come to try to take over your room, they gonna be in for a big surprise. ♪ Black girl ♪ ♪ where do you think you're going to? ♪ ♪ Young girl, where is your imagination taking you? ♪ ♪ Do you think that the clouds around you ♪ ♪ are gonna let you fly? ♪ ♪ Don't you know what can happen to a black girl ♪ ♪ who sets her eyes too high? ♪ ♪ What is your program, girl? ♪ ♪ Oh, girl ♪ ♪ what is that light shining in your eyes? ♪ ♪ Hey, girl ♪ ♪ better think twice, better think twice ♪ ♪ you know, making up a dream you can live by ♪ ♪ is hard to do ♪ ♪ are you sure you can dream of something better ♪ ♪ than what's laid out for you ♪ ♪ what are you thinking, girl? ♪ Ruth Ann: I bet you if it was my room she was coming to rip off, I'd meet her before she even got through the door. Norma:She might as well take her head off on the steps before she hit the front porch. Ooh, and, Jean, you know Norma fay don't play. Shit, just because we ain't got no fancy diplomas from no Harvard and them other highfalutin colleges, do not mean we gonna let her walk in here and walk over our sister. That's right. Billie Jean: Now hold it, y'all. I want this to be my party 'cause it's been a long time since I got funky. Right on, sis. We all gonna get funky. Ooh, here she come, y'all. Do your thing, sis. If she don't, I sure got my shit together. Thank you so much. Teach! Hi, Billie. Gimme that bag, damn it. Look who's here, y'all. It's teach. Get on in here and make yourself comfortable. Around here toting bags with all these heavyweight champs in the house. Mama Rosie? Wait a minute. It is my pull. I thought you pulled already. How the hell you thought I pulled already and you just trumped my card? Get on, then. Sure will be glad when you start winning so you can stop being so grouchy. Up there at that big, fancy white college, they don't teach you how to speak to people when you come in they house, miss teacher? I was waiting to see your faces. What the hell you got to see our faces for? You know we got 'em. Look, y'all, Santa claus done come early. Hey, you went in my suitcase. I didn't take nothing but our presents. They is for US, ain't they, teach? One, two, three-- they gots to be for US. Well, I wanted them to be a surprise. Well, ain't that nice? Which one's mine? The smaller ones have perfume in them. I'll take it. Give it here. Yes, honey, hurry up and give it to her. Go to hell, asshole. What's in this one? It's a book. I know you ain't brought me no damn book. I got the book for Billie. What I'm gonna do with it? You better take it, sis. One of them big words gets whipped on you, you'll be glad you got it. I guess the last one's mine. You got perfume, too, sis. Oh. Me and Ruth Ann, we stink? I wasn't thinking that at all. "The dance en-cy-clo..." I thought it would help you with your work. What work? Your dancing. I don't do that mess no more. You don't dance anymore? You heard her. Did mama Rosie go to work today? How the hell else is she gonna feed all these stray boarders that's always popping in on her? Yuck yuck, sure 'nough. She called and asked me to come, so I wrote back and told her that I'd be arriving-- mail don't go as fast here as it do in them big college towns. Oh, let me see now... "Dear mama Rosie, next Saturday, the 25, Travis field, flight #720." Why, you sure did write a letter. Sure 'nough you did. You mean mama Rosie doesn't get her mail? No, see, i's in charge of the inner-house mail, and beings that I been so busy lately, I ain't had a chance to route this one yet. I hope that something is coming through real clear to you, miss teacher. It's clear to me why Billie never answered about that talent search and that national tour I wrote her about. What talent search? What national tour? Oh, telling you would be like giving you your mail. And that seems to be against the rules around here. She's saying we stole Billie Jean's letter, sis. Yeah, and I don't like it worth a damn. Then how come I didn't get it? Just because she say she sent a damn letter don't mean she did. Her mouth ain't no prayer book. This new dance company they're forming, you have to be enrolled as a student, so I sent you an application for enrollment. Enrollment in college? Billie Jean didn't even finish high school. Talking about college. You didn't finish school? I could've finished if I'd wanted to. I ain't talking about the could've. I'm talking about the did. This old teacher made me mad, that's all. She talking any niggah off the street can sing and dance. They can. Miss halley's kid down the street ain't but eight years old, and she can do the same country ass-kicking you do. Whatever you call it, it was me who taught her those movements. That's what I'm talking about, fool. If some eight-year-old kid can do it, you a damn fool bussing up to some big-time college with something anybody can learn in kindergarten. You can make that company. Just get this high-school thing over with--this summer, maybe. But will they take me, that big college? Say! Where did Billie Jean go? Search me. What's the matter with y'all, drunk? Here I am. For a minute there, I thought you had done cut out on US. Think how proud mama Rosie would be-- what is all this shit about you calling my mother mama? She is not none of your goddamn mama! Your mammy lives ten blocks from here. And if you wanna call somebody mama, walk ten fucking blocks. Listen, Norma, I ain't never called your mother a mammy, and I don't think you should call my mother that. Well, if you care so damn much for her, why in the hell don't you just go stay with her? You ain't taking over Billie Jean's room. Taking over Billie's room? Is that what you think? That's what we all think. I'm going straight to law school next year when I finish, and I'm gonna be there a while. You're coming right up there to finish your education. Look, girl, why don't you leave my sister alone? She told you she don't wanna go to no white-ass college with all you sudiddy niggahs walking around with your noses all up in the air. But I wouldn't get like that. Go on up there, then, if you so bent on it. What the hell you telling US for? You gonna have a mind of your own and listen to someone else over your own sisters. I am listening to y'all, really. I thought maybe the house mama always wanted-- if I could just learn something-- aw, Billie Jean, who do you think you kidding? You ain't rarin' to go to no college 'cause of no schoolbooks. You ain't never even really been smart in no books. This gal done told you how them little old white boys up there do their thing... And that's why you breaking all out in this sweat. That ain't the reason. She ain't even said nothing about no boys. I don't know what she waiting on. By the way, how is them little white boys, miss college? Being as you had a chance to get out. I wouldn't know. I know you ain't saying you been up there all this time and you ain't tried none of them yet. That's exactly what I'm saying. Damn! Have you tried any man yet? Being that's not what I went up there for, I don't consider it a lost cause. Who you saving it for? Jesus? Girl, if you don't hurry up and get your head out them damn books and find yourself a man, you gonna go crazy. Or end up funny, one. I mean, that's a disgrace. A 21-yeard-old grown woman still walking around here guarding the stuff like it was the first national bank. I always said too much of that book stuff will sure kill off a girl's feminine stuff. And trying to drag Billie Jean into the shit. Look, let me tell you one thing-- I can see that she's filling your head with all this college talk. And I can tell you've fallen for it. Well, go ahead. But if you disgrace this family by ending up funny or something, you better change your last name. And I better not see you around here no more. I ain't going to no college. I'm just listening. I'm gonna stay right here with you and Ruth Ann. Oh, look, don't get US wrong. Me and Norma, we'd be proud to see you go off to college. Wear some nice rags. Thing she's wearing. You'd look good in stuff like that. But what me and Norma's trying to say, we want you to come back with your feminine stuff still together. Yeah. Them some nice dry goods, all right. While you over there, raise up her dress. See if she got one of them "things." I always wanted to see what one of them freaks looked like. You know, I think you done hit on something there. Sure I have. Remember how she used to always run and hide every time one of US was about to see her naked? Ain't this a bitch? All this time, we ain't even been safe in this house. Don't you put your hands on my clothes, Norma. Ooh, you better watch her, sis. If she is a man, she probably fights like one. Where you going? Get my things. Where you gonna stay? What the hell do you care where she gonna stay? Let her take her ass to her insane-ass mammy's house. You didn't think we knew about the lunaticky bitch, did you? Uh-huh. Even the insane asylum won't take her ass. Hey, don't. Beware bad dog, sis. She getting healthy. Come on, bitch! Come on. Come on. Fuck with the bear. Fool, if you don't get away from me, I'm gonna make another path up your ass. You know better than to be pulling me back when somebody's walking up on me. Hey, Norma, you the winner, baby! Everything is cool! What you waiting on, tramp? Get your ass in gear... Before the butcher starts carving some Bologna. I wanted to tee off on her so bad, I could taste it. Tell me why. Why would you, of all people, do something like that? I didn't have nothing to do with them talking about your mama. Well, if you didn't get your kicks out of that, what was in it for you? You said you'd never change, but, oh, have you changed. Look, don't you be putting all that stuff on my head and be acting surprised like you don't know what's been going on. Ever since the day you came in this house, I can't say nothing to my mama that she don't be throwing your name up to me. I didn't know she was doing all that. You know now. I mean, how do you think I feel knowing my mama sat down, talked to you, and probably put her arms all around you, and told you she loved you and everything? She never did all of that. You just throwing stuff in that never happened. She never told me anything like that. She didn't? I swear to god she didn't. Really? It's not even her way. Look, how long do it take you to put your shit in that suitcase? It all depends how big the suitcase is. Are you trying to play on my intelligence? I'm trying to get out of here. Hell, you done had plenty enough time to do that. It just didn't close-- ain't nobody asked you nothin'. Billie, did you really teach Mrs. Halley's kids how to dance? I sure wish I could teach someone how to dance. Now, all you men that pledged to help off with the service at our mother's day luncheon this afternoon, if you didn't bring your aprons with you, you go on back home and get it. Now, y'all know that at every father's day luncheon, the women always tries to make US feel like kings, now, don't they? All: Amen. You brothers might as well say amen. You know I'm telling you the truth. All: Amen. Don't the sisters do right by US on father's day? Make me know it, then. All: Amen. Some of you men sitting out there I knew when your mothers had to almost hock your underwears to get you out of trouble or something. All: Amen. This is my mother. Pardon me, sister foster. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for mama. Ain't nobody gonna stand by you like mama. Don't care what you done to her before. God bless you for bringing your mama to church this morning. She's sure been needing you. You back to stay with US for a while now? Just for a while, sister Jenkins. As long as I can. God bless you. You gotta keep on praying for mama, and she'll be all right one day. Thank you, sister Jenkins. Now come on, y'all. That offering is mighty noisy. I can hear it way up here. And I know the lord can hear it. You know the lord don't wanna be counting all them coins that you're putting in there. I say amen. Amen. Make sure that you put in your love offering. Will you wait a minute till I get my change out of there? Ain't you gonna put your tithe in?

You got plenty of people to lean on. My mother only has me. I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I can't deal with all this. Deal with what? What is it? I understand about your mother. You should've called me. I am my mother's daughter, not yours. I ran away from my mother years ago because I wasn't strong enough then. But I am going to her now. It's as simple as that.

Herbert, put this on the living room table for me. Okay, dear. Acted more like big sisters to Billie Jean, but we thought it was a stage she was going through. We don't deal with it now, it's gonna be too late. Ruth Ann: Sure will. That's the way I feel about it. I'm really afraid that Billie Jean is gonna fool around and get hurt hanging around in one of them places. Me, too, mama. And you work hard every day. You can't look after everything. Besides, you done the best you could for her. You really have. So what we got to do now is just take the time out from our own lives and just try to save Billie Jean's. Billie Jean? Ma'am? I think it's time you and me had a little talk. Now, you almost 18, you ain't got no job, no husband, or no nothing. You ain't gonna hang out in honky-Tonks until some old drunk niggah comes and kills you... 'Cause I'd rather kill you myself. I'm not gonna hang out in no honky-Tonks. What you gonna do? You don't know, do you? I do know. What is you gonna do? I'm going up to where netta is to finish high school, and I'm going to college. Girl, why don't you stop lying? Are you crazy? Now, you're not going up there where she is. You're just not going. Mama, if she just wanna finish high school, how come she can't do it here? She wanna get off away from you and hang around in them joints with men. That's not what I wanna do. You sound like you is losing your mind. She needs to be in a reform school 'cause she gonna get hurt. Do you want me to call the truant officer? Yes. What? Rosie: Where you going? And come back here. I told you, this child is beside herself. What's the trouble? Ain't nobody call you out here. Call mu'dear for me. You better not. Ain't nobody scared of you. You knows I ain't. Dear, you better come here and see about this mess. And I know you better get your ass out of my house. What's all the screaming in here? What's going on? Dear, call the truant officer. Don't be twisting on that child like that. Hold her. Shit, I'll call him myself. Ain't nobody gonna call nobody till I find out what this is about. Dear, Billie Jean is my child. But what did she do? All I said was that I'm going to college. Turn her loose. I said turn her loose. Rosie, sure enough, Billie Jean is your child, but I got a feeling you're wrong. Y'all lie. You ain't never in your life called me a liar. And god's gonna whip you for that. When you're laying on your deathbed, god's gonna whip you 'cause I'm your mother. You don't understand what I been through with these girls. You don't know nothing about nobody in this house 'cause you're too busy trying to save strangers. If anybody touch one of them gals off the street, you'll bring down the wrath of god. But with your own children, your own family... What about my own family? What kind of love did you give me to pass on? You're gonna carry that to your grave, ain't you? You're gonna whip me with that until it kills you or me. I loves all of you. I did what I could for Billie Jean. I didn't raise her for no dancing and shaking her tail in public. God didn't make you perfect in your judgment, either. You could be wrong about Billie Jean. God knows I ain't crazy about her wanting to be no dancer, but that's her life. Now, if she don't make nothing out of it, it will be her nothing. You want US to stand around and let her ruin her life? She can't do no worse with her'n than you done with your'n. Now, Rosie, you come to your senses. There's your cab, baby. Mama, I'm fixing to go now. [ Honks horn ] I'll write you to let you know I got there all right. It takes about eight hours or something like that. Thanksgiving is the next big holiday. If I have the money, I'll come home. [ Cabbie honks horn ] You take care of yourself now, you hear? I will, mu'dear. I'll be writing you. And don't you stay away too long. I won't. Hurry up now. They charges for waiting, you know. Billie Jean... Ma'am? I ain't never in all my life apologized to nobody for nothing. Just ain't in me. Yes, ma'am. But you drop a card or something and... Let me know how your dancing's coming on. You hold your head up now. Stay with the lord. Mama... Billie Jean knows I didn't try to hurt her. She knows that now, honey. Just seemed like...
