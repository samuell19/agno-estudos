Our care facility. They are all cloned... cloned dogs. You don't get any more of a story of success all the way to miracle healing than Dr. Hwang. It was not only a scientific breakthrough, but it was a political one, and that is what caught the attention of both the scientists and the world. South Korea will be an economic power 100 years faster than planned. The promise was that people who were paralyzed would walk again, and people who are dying from diseases would have those diseases in remission. At that time, it was huge. "Finally, Koreans are the world's best!" First, we have shocking and devastating news. Disgraced stem cell researcher, Hwang Woo-suk, has been sentenced to one year and six months in prison and two years of probation. The scientist has gone from Jesus to Lucifer. When science is seen as this thing that can save us, what are the consequences of scientists taking advantage of that? The story becomes a really important one to tell, in the understanding of both the heights that a misguided attention to the wrong things like fame and money can bring you to and then the depths that profound ethical violations can drop you to. We started selectively breeding animals many, many thousands of years ago. But something much, much more powerful is happening now. For the first time in the history of this planet, we are able to directly design organisms. We can manipulate the plasms of life with unprecedented power. It's not science fiction. It is theoretically possible that before too long, we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark. How many camels have you cloned from these? Uh... More than 150. Science often gallops way ahead of the ethics. Good intentions is never an excuse for bad behavior. Look what happened to Dr. Hwang. The fact that he was trying to do something for the good of everybody does not excuse such profound misbehavior. He's sitting on top of the world, he's done something no other human being has done, and then he takes the complete fall and collapse. I mean, it is a story for the ages in some ways. Humans made to order. Mothers giving birth to themselves. Babies conceived just so their body parts can be transplanted. Come with me into the scary new world of cloning. Living here, in the middle of this desert, day to day, month to month, listening to this type of music, it gives me a lot of meaning to each aspect of my life. And perhaps in the eyes of others, there's just as much pain as there is glory in the history of Korea. Uh... And in what I chose to do throughout my career in my past. But unfortunately, those things cannot be erased. That was who I was. This is the... reception area of the main building. The portraits you are looking at are of the key leaders of the UAE. Sheikh Zayed, the current president is Sheikh Khalifa, uh... Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed, our big boss, Sheikh Mansour. - Welcome! - Hello! - How are you? - Fine, how are you? Welcome. Thank you for having me. - Thank you for coming. - How are you? - Okay, I'm good. - Very good. Thanks. I suppose you could say I had... a lot of nicknames. I was once called the best lecturer at Seoul National University. At one point, I was also considered a national embarrassment. And I was treated as such. I'm sure they are fully aware of everything I've done in this country as well. But even after everything, they are still ready to fully support me. When we get one cell from your camel... So you start to work with the skin only? - Mainly, not only. - That's... But the best portion is the skin. Quite a good scene, isn't it? One man crazy, three very sane spectators. First, we have to understand what cloning actually is. You take an egg, and you take the nucleus out of the egg. Then you take a body cell from the individual you want to clone. It could be a skin cell, it could be a liver cell, it could be any cell, and you take the nucleus out of that cell, and you put it into the egg. And now what you have is an egg that looks a lot like a fertilized egg, because our body cells have all the DNA we need to be an individual. Now the question is, can you get that egg to start reproducing? When we use electricity, just like in Frankenstein, we give it a little jolt of electricity, and it begins to split and become an organism. That's cloning at its most basic. It's alive. It's alive. It's alive! It's alive! It's alive! Actually, today is the due day. Night, huh? Tonight, huh? God willing. In this place, we have a total of six cloned baby camels. Amongst them, the black ones are beauty camels. Next, the baby that was born yesterday, and the white camel over there are both racing camels. And, uh... today, or possibly sometime tonight, a third racing camel will be born. The baby is coming now. Among those criticizing cloning technology, some say that cloning is wrong, that it is interfering with the will of God, and with the process of natural creation. Some even say it's an attempt to play God. Cloning is not that kind of technology. No. What cloning is... is a genetic copy. We cannot simply create DNA out of a vacuum. One might say that history has already proved it. In this world, has there ever been a Frankenstein? No, not yet, right? Every time I see such a creature, I feel the greatness of science and technology. It is a sense of awe at how much science and technology have contributed to humanity. I take pride in our science and technology. This is what I feel. - So only one embryo, yeah? Not two. - Just one. Alex Tinson's my name. I'm an Australian veterinarian who started out wanting to be a zoo vet and ended up being a camel specialist. I was working at one of these old-fashioned lion safari sort of places. Believe it or not, we had a few, sort of, disasters there in terms of the lions and tigers eating people. I nearly got eaten a couple of times myself, I must say. And in the end, the place got closed down. Going, single embryo. In those days, after you've been a vet for a year or two, you literally went and knocked up your shingle somewhere and said, "Right, I'm a vet, come and see me," you know? These days, there's a lot more regulation. I came to the Middle East for two years, and 35 years later, I'm still here. My daughter's married to an Emirati whose... a lot of the relatives are camel racers, so I look after my relatives' camels. But I guess pretty much from day one, I always felt that my personal interest was the breeding side. We had a camel called Mabrukan. He was a show camel, and he was big, he was black. People laugh at me about beauty camels. How do you rate a good-looking bulldog? How do you rate, uh, you know, best in show and crafts? It's the same thing. You got a committee. They judge the height, the color, the ease, position, how it walks. Mabrukan was just the biggest, most amazing, expensive camel we ever had. He was the first camel to get a 10 out of 10 beauty score. Never happened before. He was literally the size of a dinosaur. When I was standing next to him to take blood, his head was like this, you know. You felt like you were taking blood from a T-Rex. He was magnificent, but he was also very dangerous, you know? Because he was ridiculously big and strong. He had teeth the size of a lion, and he was a bit grumpy. He was just a logistical nightmare because of his size, because of his value. I mean, he was five million US dollars when he was bought. One of the other ruling families from another country offered, I think, in excess of 20 million dollars for the camel. And His Highness refused. He said, "No, not for sale." We were trying to breed him a bit. And he was a real headache because you'd bring the best-looking camels to him, he wasn't interested in those. He liked the scrubbers. The ones that didn't look that... I don't know. It was bloody hopeless. Anyhow, one day, I was with a whole lot of friends in Rome, and we went to this restaurant. So I get the phone call. The bloke on the other end says, "Mabrukan's dead." And I'm just... I'm sitting there, dead silent. And then I stood up and I said, "Cut out his testicles! Get some skin! Put them in the fridge! I'll be back tonight." And then we forgot about it for ten years. Some people say cloning is only for rich people. It is no doubt expensive. But I will take my last money to clone my dog. Csillo is a French bulldog, and they've got a special geometry of the face, more like a human. Csillo comes from the name Csillag. It's Hungarian for "star." And he was, for me, the star of my life, actually. So that's why I called him Csillo. It is a very deep relationship because we interact very much. And he took part in the family. He put me, for example, to bed. So when I was looking TV in the night, and he thought, "Oh, it's too late, I must sleep," he came to me to bring me to, to the bed. So that's why I think he's like an older brother. He really gives me support, I think, and the laugh. The laugh, I think, is the biggest thing he gave me because when I went away, he was crying. His mood changed. The more days I was away, the more he got nervous, the more he got sad. And when I saw that he had this lymph nodule at his neck, I understood it was something serious. You could see that his life was in a bad shape. He was suffering a lot. I knew cloning is possible. And then I was thinking, "Yes, I want to clone Csillo." It would be a wonderful thing to see. I started to do research, where I could contact, who was doing it. There are some companies who can do some steps, but not further processing. And the Americans were quite easygoing. They'd say, "We do cloning. Quite good success rate." But when I was researching about Dr. Hwang, I found out that he had got a huge experience and that he was like a pioneer in this. Let us now introduce the cloned calf. This is "super calf." The cry of the cloned calf was healthy and strong when it was born. After eight years of research, Professor Hwang's team created the cloned calf using cell nuclear transfer techniques in his lab at Seoul National University. When it's ready to be applied to domestic livestock farms in Korea, there will be huge savings on imports of about 700 billion won, creating added value of about 1,500 billion won per year. At the time, the public did not know who he was. He was merely a simple professor from Seoul National University. Since calves were expensive, it was breaking news when Hwang Woo-suk succeeded in cloning. So government officials arranged a meeting between the president at the time and Hwang Woo-suk. Hwang Woo-suk, a professor at Seoul National University, was allowed to meet him. This was a special occasion as regular citizens could never meet the president. Not even if they were distinguished scientists. He had numbers in the hundreds of, of cows that he was cloning and, uh, other, other animals. He, he wanted to clone a, um, a Korean tiger. And the Korean tiger is very symbolic. He was describing it as a way to get North Korea and South Korea to come together because it was their common heritage. They had this endangered species, and he wanted to be able to clone it. He thought that if a North Korean tiger, a gift from the north, could be cloned using South Korean technology, there would be no greater scientific event. Hwang did not hesitate. He grasped the opportunity. Hearing about the process to clone a Korean tiger, it sounds technically complicated. Could a tiger be successfully cloned? Yes, I am hoping that by the year 2000. I will succeed in cloning the Korean tiger. Thank you. With this claim, he knew he could garner the attention of the public, and raise research funds. At that time, there were no "Korean tigers" in South Korea. They had gone extinct, as the last remaining tigers, the breeding tigers, had failed, so to speak. From the Pyongyang Zoo in North Korea, the last two Korean tigers who were still alive, one male and one female, were sent to South Korea in a sort of animal exchange program. In the beginning, the easiest egg to, uh, to obtain was the pig egg. Compared to other animal eggs, it's easy to use them for surrogates. So at first, we used the Korean tiger donor cell and injected it right into the pig egg. Afterwards, we took it to the next level, which was to use the cow egg. And after that, once we'd confirmed that initial development was possible using the pig and the cow, we moved on to using domestic cats. At this time, we used, um, the tiger and the lion. We used each of the animals as surrogate mothers. One of the lions developed a... a hernia. So after the implantation, the wound didn't heal, and there were complications. We observed that the intestines... The innards came out and ultimately, the animal perished. That is when we stopped the experiment. This is what science is. And some might think it reckless, but in science, you can't ignore a path just because it's reckless. Through the process, there are trials. But again, we obtain scientific data, so nothing goes to waste. We make sure of it. Scientists in South Korea have, for the first time, successfully cloned a dog. It is an Afghan Hound, and as of today, it is 101 days old. Dr. Hwang's team has declared the dog's cloning a success and it is seen as the peak of animal cloning research. The name of the world's first cloned dog is Snuppy. The name is Seoul National University's English acronym and the word "puppy" put together. Researchers say the puppy is healthy and normal. American researchers had tried for a long time to take on the difficult task of cloning a puppy named Missy. But they had repeatedly failed. We bred dogs so much that their genomes were very fragile in certain ways. That made them difficult to clone. He was a very skilled scientist. So it wasn't a surprise to the scientific community that he did it. I mean, people were surprised only because they didn't know who would be first. It was a race. I believe that in this case, our success sends a... message to others in the bioengineering world and cloning field. And it is not a small one. The fact that we can successfully clone dogs is not a small feat. Because it means if we are given the opportunity, and the necessary conditions required, we can believe that cloning almost any other animal is possible. Dr. Hwang had a lot of funding. He had a lot of fancy machines and micromanipulators that are used to manipulate the eggs. He had technicians who he claimed had special training with their hands. "Chopstick-trained hands." About 30 researchers in Professor Hwang's team work, on average, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The "chopstick technique" which involves removing the nucleus from an egg in a split second, is a technique that is mindboggling to bioengineers around the world. Foreigners have slower hands, so... Let's say we do 100 an hour, they manage fewer than us. One day, I heard from the UAE government that there used to be a symbolic camel in their country named Mabrukan, but 10 years ago, it suddenly died. They asked me what the possibility of cloning Mabrukan was. So I told them, "The probability is less than one percent." One day, we were told literally to come to the conference room. In walked Prof. Hwang with his team. And, if I'm really honest, did I really think we were gonna clone him? No. I thought we could get some individual sperm into sperm injection and get an offspring. At last, 11 years after its death, 11 cloned Mabrukans were born from this science. Ten Mabrukans. They are now living here in the UAE as extremely treasured subjects. When the brain function... and the heartbeat come to a halt, those are considered to be some of the early signs of death, but we think otherwise. Forget about medical death. We do not think an organism is totally dead until the body cell no longer has the potential to be cultured as a cell line. In this line of work, that is our definition of death. Our research has proved to us time and time again, that a single cell itself is, in fact, a living thing. I must say, the first time, I was just standing there, holding this animal. And I thought to myself, "This thing was dead for 10 years." "I used to look after it, and here it is back." And I've got to say I cannot explain the feeling. Does it feel like a God complex? Yes, unfortunately, it does. At that moment, you suddenly thought, "God, what have we done? Isn't this just incredible?" And then you just think, "God, what have we done?" The last day of Csillo, actually, he was in, in this room. He came back from the vet. He was sleeping here on my arms, and he knew he would die. And that's why he was a bit shaking. He wanted to be with us. And this point, we, uh, he was, he's, he died here, actually. Here, he died. Yes. Here, he still had hope. You see, his eyes still wanted to live. But the last day, he could not live anymore. We were shocked. Csillo was dead after 12 years. Because you must know, the shock is... That's why it was so strong. He did not age, actually. He was always playful, he was always young, always full of power. He was in a completely good shape. He was in super shape. Although French bulldogs live only 12, if he did not have this leukemia, he would live for maybe 20 years. And because of this, it was very shocking that it happened to him. From one day to the other, everything turned out bad. I tried to put the sadness of losing him into the happiness of recreating him. I guess one way to look at it is... grief is the catalyst. It's where our... cloning process really begins. I started to buy a cloning kit. How to take the sample, how to store the samples, and we took the samples from the ear. Because the ear, the fibroblasts are more easily to let them grow after. We sent to England. There's cell storage for animals. From England, they went to Korea. Because it was in the transition time when he went from Korea to Abu Dhabi. Although we can't guarantee success, we told them to send the tissues quickly. Dr. Hwang was so nice. Once he had cells growing, he made pictures. Then he sent me pictures of it. And he had two teams working on it. But when they clone dogs, it's quite difficult to achieve, so they make more dogs. And I cloned Csillo because I wanted to have Csillo back. Not a sea dog, not a, a playing football dog. I wanted Csillo, Csillo back. The problem in the cloning process is that there could be many failures. So what they're doing, they make multiple trials, so it can be that you get five dogs back, or four dogs back, or three. So we had two cloned Csillo, actually, at this time. We had... The first clone of Csillo was born in November, and I thought, "Look, I have a cloned dog! It's fantastic!" And then the assistant of Dr. Hwang called me. "We have got another Csillo." The first of these two brothers died, very early afterwards, because of the malformation. He starved to death, actually. We couldn't do nothing. It was too young. I can tell you now, Csillo two, he's one year and a half old now, and he's a happy dog. And that's why I know I did everything right. This cloning is... not about... copying 100%. We are copying genetically, we're copying the DNA. We are not copying the phenotype. Therefore, there might be a slight difference from the original. So this is what we say to people. We didn't know what to do with Csillo's body. We didn't know if we should bury him or... What are we doing with him? Some people are putting it, you know, stuff it or do something. So we put him in the fridge. Our idea is that we'll find a place where Csillo can be. We did not want to put him in a cemetery here in Hungary. We wanted to be next to him. And we want to find a place where he would be happy and where we connect always with him. That's what we, we find now. A place in a garden where we can go and where we can cherish him, and it will be his place. At this time, in the genus of dogs, I think we have... I think we have cloned roughly 1,600 dogs. We've also cloned cows, pigs, wolves, coyotes, cats, horses. When Dolly the sheep was cloned, there were no rules or laws against it. There still aren't to this day, as far as animals are concerned. But the majority of Americans said they thought cloning animals was wrong. And it took another eight to ten months to a year for scientists and the media to say, "You're not getting what cloning really is. Here's what it is." And then slowly, those numbers went down, down, down until you had Americans saying, "Well, okay, things like cloning sheep are fine." Once you get to cloning primates and then to human beings, though, it's an entirely different kind of conversation. Now, a major development in human cloning, health correspondent, Susan Dentzer begins. Other scientists have previously cloned small numbers of human embryos that live for a short time. By contrast, the South Koreans who announced their work today in the journal, Science, apparently succeeded on a scale that far outstripped earlier human cloning efforts. It was earth-shattering in the sense that this was the first step towards the world of regenerative medicine when we were actually going to be able to start using these cells for all kinds of therapeutic uses. The researchers began with a group of 16 women, who were given hormone treatments to produce large numbers of reproductive egg cells. Then the scientists used innovative techniques to strip out the nucleus from each of the egg cells. The scientists next took body cells from the same women who had donated the egg cells. The body cells have two sets of chromosomes, the full genetic blueprint needed to create a human being. The scientists then removed these body cells' nuclear material and placed it into the egg cells. The result was 66 cloned eggs, in effect, human embryos, with the exact genetic makeup of the original females. There was this tremendous interest from the point of view of regenerative medicine. Because if you can take a cell and you can make it into any of the cells in the body, you know, could we make new livers? Could we grow new organs? Could we regenerate damaged nerve cells? And so there was this huge, sort of, therapeutic interest as well. You had some pretty prominent scientists talking about this as, as car parts that we'd be replacing. Embryonic stem cells are the building block cells that ultimately develop into almost all the cells and tissues of the body. The South Korean researchers extracted these primordial cells from the embryos, destroying the embryos in the process. They then grew entire colonies of genetically identical stem cells. You need to recognize that the primary American contribution to the work in Seoul has been Coca-Cola. Woo-suk lives on caffeine and sugar. This was the biological dream. Dr. Hwang became a world-famous scientist. He was very much being hailed as a scientific superstar in South Korea. There will come a time when I can share information with you. It is reputation. It is money. It is your place in the pantheon of science for all time so that the textbooks a hundred years from now are going to mention your name. It's absolutely stunning how brilliant the scientific advances have been and how important the medical implications are. His accomplishment here is... is fantastic, but what people are most amazed by is not his scientific ability, but by his ability to get these eggs. The crucial resource was getting eggs to grow in the clone cells. You need eggs to grow these things. And it's not easy to get human eggs. During the monthly menstrual cycle, one of the ovaries releases an egg. After ovulation, the egg enters the fallopian tube. A woman is most likely to become pregnant if she has sex in the days just before, during, or right after ovulation. Dr. Hwang claimed he used 242 eggs. That means that he had to ask women to take a drug to hyperstimulate their ovaries, and then use a needle to aspirate from their ovaries, one at a time, to use in research. I think one thing that is often obscured by the scientific language is the bodily burden on women that's involved in, you know, the biological labor of producing eggs and the kind of biomedical reality of women going through cycles of ovarian hyperstimulation and harvesting. There were different rules in different countries about how you might access ova. But in every case, there is only one way to do it, and that is to get consent from a woman. He claimed that he had 16 women that gave 242 eggs. And he claimed that these were all volunteers that had done this just out of the good of their heart because they believed in his research. We were thinking, "Well, this is amazing that he did this." So when I was in his office, I'd ask him, "How did you get these eggs? Where did they come from?" Once again, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the many dignified women who were willing to provide their eggs for this study. I was working for Nature, which is a very well-known international science magazine, and I was the Asia-Pacific correspondent. And I was trying to find out more about biomedical science in Korea, stem cell research in Korea, and I really didn't think that I was going to uncover something. I didn't think that he had done anything demonstrably wrong. I was just getting some weird vibes from him. I mean, he was giving me answers that weren't complete, and he looked uncomfortable when I asked these questions. So I decided just to call everybody on the paper. There were 15 co-authors, and the first author is usually the person who does all the work. The last author was the senior professor who has kind of designed the experiment, and I just started calling each of them, hoping that I could find one person who could say, "Yes, I was in charge of the process. This is how we did it." Several of them said, "Just talk to Dr. Hwang. I don't want to talk to you." But finally, I had a woman on the phone, and she said, "I can't tell you about the egg donation process in general. I can only tell you about my own procedure." It took me a second. "So you donated your eggs for the experiment?" She said, "Yes, I donated my eggs." And then it hit me that this was... this was something... this was something big. So I asked her about all of the procedures that she went through, where she did it, why she did it. She said she had already had children, she wasn't worried even if it made her unable to have children. She said, "There are so many people with spinal cord injuries in Korea. I want to help them out any way I can." She basically said Dr. Hwang was going to be a savior to people, and she wanted to be a part of it. At that time, we had many female researchers in the lab. All the female researchers were called into his office. Hwang Woo-suk showed them the papers, and personally explained all the details of his contents, then asked them to sign it. The majority of the female researchers in the lab signed the papers without a second thought, and Professor Hwang collected them. I think it's fairly likely that if you were a junior female researcher working in a lab at this time and you thought that giving your eggs was a way that you could make this breakthrough happen, you would do it, willingly. You might not even need to be asked. But was it really voluntary? Did they have any choice? Um, I think, in the matter, did the well-respected, senior scientist coming into the lab and saying, "Well, we need some eggs. Where on Earth can we get them from?" Is that a form of coercion? The article I wrote was basically about there being ethical problems with the research that Dr. Hwang did not want to recognize. And the title of the article was, "Korean cloners dogged by ethical problems," and I told Dr. Hwang this. And he said, "If you do that, you're going to have very big problems." It has been revealed that the funding provided to Professor Hwang's team by the government and private organizations amount to over 100 billion won. Do you feel powerful, Professor Hwang? Power? What power? It just means there is greater responsibility. I thought that the article would lead to further investigation and that they would find what I wrote was true and that there would be more reflection on this, and probably some headaches for Dr. Hwang, but... I was surprised that there was only negative reaction to my article, to the integrity of my article. And among the scientific community, there was very little said. And this is the star of embryonic stem cell research, of cloning research. This is the guy at the center of it all, and if he has serious bioethical problems in his research, then we should be talking about it. But no one wanted to talk about it. And then Dr. Hwang's second human cloning paper came out in May of 2005, so just over a year after his first. This report brings science a giant step forward toward the day when some of humankind's most devastating diseases and injuries can be effectively treated through the use of therapeutic stem cells. That 2005 paper was a step towards the ability to be able to use a patient's own cells to create therapies for that patient. The work that you do in Korea doesn't occur anywhere else in the world. Therapeutic cloning offers the hope of understanding treatment and cures for millions and millions of people around the world. Scientists say it's the greatest discovery of our lifetime. Dr. Hwang claimed that he took a fertilized egg that has managed to divide into a certain number of cells. Each one of those cells are what we call pluripotent stem cells, which means that every one of those cells can turn into a kidney cell, or a lung cell, or a skin cell. And the goal here was to take this cloned, fertilized egg and be able to clone it into many so that you could get stem cells that all would actually be identical to that original, which, in a uterus, would develop into a full human being. And so that's basically what he did. He created stem cells that were cloned from the original human being. At that time, stem cell science was going to revolutionize medicine. It was going to be transformative. And so, in some ways, for any country, achieving that level of breakthrough science would have been something to strive for. 2002 FIFA WORLD CUP KOREA/JAPAN At the time, South Korea was transitioning from being a developing country to a developed country. So naturally, there was a strong pride. "Now, we're not following others, that time is done. Instead, we're the ones leading with something new. We're among the world's best. It's time that we have the best technology, the best science, and so on." This mindset was very strong during that period. The World Stem Cell Hub, which will reposition Korea into the mecca for life science research worldwide, opened its doors today. We now have hope that human being sufferings might someday be alleviated by the breakthroughs enabled by patient-specific embryonic stem cells. In the past, I was not a big help. But now, I am helping out a little bit. From this moment onwards, I will provide full support. Basically, the world was divided into two camps at that point. There was a group that supported embryonic stem cell research, and there was a group that said embryos are humans and they shouldn't be torn apart to use their cells for embryonic stem cell research. Tonight, I ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research. Human cloning in all its forms, creating or implanting embryos for experiments, creating human-animal hybrids, and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos. As early as next month, the hub will be registering patients with incurable diseases. I've dreamed that I can get up and throw away the wheelchair. Maybe get some walkers. At that time, most of the public was still unfamiliar with the concept of stem cells. When the notion of stem cells was finally introduced to the public, it was presented as a medical advance that could do anything and cure all diseases. So almost all patients, almost all people with disabilities, they began having big dreams and came to depend on them. Hallelujah, my beloved disciples of Christ. Have you been well this week? "Who am I? And where did I come from?" Throughout history, all humans have looked for answers to these difficult questions. And through the 19th and 20th centuries, humans found those answers in science. Therefore, humans have effectively replaced God with science. Could it be true? My child was involved in a car accident in 2002. He woke up after 24 days from a coma state. And after that, his lower body from the chest down was... completely paralyzed. In that time period, I think Dr. Hwang had requested help from the Gil Medical Center. He was looking for a patient. A patient that would volunteer and participate in the stem cell research that he was conducting. The doctor at the Gil Medical Center who was in charge of caring for my son, Hyeon-yi, asked if we would be interested in taking part in this research. Later, we ended up visiting the laboratory of Dr. Hwang Woo-suk upon his generous invitation. And I realized just how incredible this technology was and I started to have some hope. Kang Won-rae was a member of a successful two-man dance group. He was well-known for his excellent dancing skills, and in the past, he had built his career as a backup dancer for a very famous singer. They were even called "Clon." I hope that... Mr. Kang Won-rae will... stand again and show us his sharp dancing skills we remember from his past. They staged the whole scene. I mean, he told a man sitting, a man in a wheelchair that he will make him walk again. That's something Jesus said. So he told a pastor's son that he would make him walk. Who does he think he is, Jesus Christ? What is this? You know, there was an American actor named Christopher Reeve, who starred as Superman. He said that he knew about the work that Dr. Hwang was doing. Therapeutic cloning, also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, offers real hope. The post stamp. They released a commemorative post stamp. Someone sitting in a wheelchair and getting up and starting to walk is depicted continuously on these stamps. Wow. It's crazy. How can a scientist say things like, "I can make you walk"? You can't say that as a scientist. At the time, the most famous person in our country was Park Ji-sung. If I were to compare it to today, how should I explain this? If we were to think of it in cultural terms... BTS? Or Son Heung-min? Combine their fame? That was the public sentiment towards Professor Hwang Woo-suk. That was his power. Seoul National University professor, Hwang Woo-suk, has been selected as its top scientist. At the Palace Hotel Seoul this morning, the Ministry of Science and Technology has appointed Hwang Woo-suk as the chief scientist with a unanimous vote. Professor Hwang will receive three billion won in research funding for each of the next five years. Hwang was getting all of this scientific and medical and public interest, but at the same time, these cells are coming from human embryos, and that's obviously controversial for some because they regard human embryos as sacred or deserving of protection. You know, they're the start of human life. So there was a lot of debate about this at the time. PD NOTE These people have come to PD Note with heavy hearts. They have shared their stories, requesting that they remain anonymous for protection. I worked at PD Note around 2005. It's an investigative program that most Koreans know and among all the investigative programs, it was ranked number one. When I first received the tip, the first thing I thought was, "Ah, this could be..." Because this was about Dr. Hwang, a university professor, I thought it would be about sexual harassment. The informant used the expression, "Riding on the back of a tiger that I can no longer get off of." So he made up his mind to tip PD Note. "I was on Dr. Hwang Woo-suk's research team, and... and I have information... to share with you regarding an important issue. I'd like to meet to talk about it." As a producer, as a PD, as someone who makes documentaries, no matter how uncomfortable the truth is, it is the journalist's duty to reveal it. So I thought I would go and listen to the informant and find out what this personal information was, and if it was serious enough. But the person who showed up was Han Hak-soo, whom I hadn't known before. At the time, I had my guard up. So when he first arrived, I immediately began to gauge whether I could trust this person or not. When I got there, Mr. Ryu Young-joon, um, took me to a quiet room and before he said anything to me, the very first question he asked me was this. "Producer Han, what's more important to you? The truth or national interest?" Producer Han Hak-soo replied, without a second of hesitation, "Truth itself is the national interest." That was when I knew, "Ah, I could trust him." He made illegal transactions with regards to the eggs. Those eggs were illegally traded. When we were preparing for our 2004 research paper, Dr. Hwang and I didn't know how to procure the eggs. We had no idea where to get them. I reached out to all the labs in the country that frequently used eggs as part of their research, and subsequently visited them myself to follow up. I asked them if they could provide us with eggs for our experiment, but they all refused. They said there were no more eggs left. And that they wouldn't help us because what we were trying to do was ethically problematic. And that was the conclusion. Dr. Hwang was extremely upset. From that moment on, he started visiting hospitals in person and noted the ones willing to help. He concluded that it had to be Mizmedi, a maternity hospital specializing in infertility treatment. Whenever the ethical problem of the eggs used in research came up, Professor Hwang Woo-suk has emphasized that he has only used eggs donated by dignified women. I have already communicated to the foreign press and media just how grateful I am... to all of these women. I haven't had the chance to meet all of them personally, but it is true that they have each volunteered to donate their precious eggs for research to assist in this scientific experiment. However, through our PD Note investigation, we found that this claim was untrue. Over the past few months, we have secured evidence showing that more than 600 eggs were provided through trade. This woman, who visited an egg brokerage company she found on the Internet, seemed to have no idea that her eggs had been used in Professor Hwang's research. A woman, who provided eggs to Professor Hwang's research twice, also admitted to selling her eggs through brokers. RECENT APPOINTMENTS MATERNITY CLINIC They recruited these young women to provide their eggs for up to, um, three million won or two million five hundred thousand won. Are there any ethical issues when it comes to the eggs used in the experiment? Well... Were the eggs bought? We don't have any such cases. Thank you, Professor Hwang, have a good day. Thank you. The number of eggs they illegally procured by recruiting these women is really beyond our imagination. So when I first started reporting on the... glaring ethical issues regarding Dr. Hwang's eggs and how he obtained them? The whole country turned upside down. Save Professor Hwang Woo-suk... After that, supporters of Hwang Woo-suk surrounded our MBC building 24/7. At night, they held candles. They had candlelight vigils. "Please don't broadcast PD Note." "Please stop the reports on Dr. Hwang Woo-suk on PD Note." At the rally, people with disabilities came, famous people came, as well as regular civilians who supported Hwang Woo-suk. PEOPLE IN SUPPORT OF HWANG WOO-SUK JANUARY 11TH, GWANGHWAMUN, SEOUL At that time, we'd go to Seoul every week. My daughter was young, she was six years old. We'd go there, and she'd be fine during the day. But she'd get sleepy at night, and she would whine. So then we'd have to get back to the car. I would carry her on my back. Then the police would escort me all the way back to the car. They would ask me where I was from, and I said I was from Cheongju. Then they would cheer me on, saying I was doing something impressive, secretly. That's what the police said. The citizens are watching! The citizens are watching! Give him another chance! Give him another chance! My fellow Koreans, whom I respect, the research we are conducting is the world's first at every level and step. To repay... the warm support that the citizens have shown, and for the hopes of patients around the world suffering from incurable diseases, I will continue on my path with only the purest... of scientific interests. Dr. Hwang really understood the mood of society at that time, as well as the national patriotism. That's why, two days after we aired the report on the eggs, he invited so many, so many journalists and he hosted a live press conference. If I were a woman, it's true that I would have wanted to extract my own eggs to conduct my scientific experiments. This case shows how Korean society hastily acts to put out results first and pushes all other things to the periphery. And how the truth can so easily be overlooked for the sake of the country as a whole, all wrapped up in such a dogma, in such fascist beliefs. "Why are you undermining a promising scientist? You should keep your mouth shut for the sake of the country. They're developing technology for the advancement of our country and instead of helping, you're complaining." DR. HWANG IS KOREA'S HOPE AND FUTURE Those women were volunteering their eggs and I... I was completely shocked. It was the first time I felt that our nation had gone mad. Because usually, it goes like this. Lots of eggs are needed for experiments, and those eggs were extracted from young women. I heard that it's an excruciating process to extract eggs. I felt for the first time that we were like Germany in the 1930s. The number of voluntary egg donors for Dr. Hwang's research has now reached 1,000. The protesters said that if there were so many issues with the eggs, then they would voluntarily donate their own eggs for research. So the fan club would actually hold events for voluntary egg donor patients. Many women, along with relatives of people with incurable diseases and disabilities have gathered today to create a foundation for the donation of eggs. If women understand the purpose and use of their egg donation, for research and treatment, they will participate with their own will and judgment. We are all human beings and we feel that sharing the pain with others who are less fortunate is the best path. It wasn't easy. It wasn't, but I... I mean, it was for research and it couldn't be done without eggs. So, I gladly... I, I took it out from my body. I saw it as a seed of life. I wanted to donate it, with pleasure. I didn't do it for the individual, Dr. Hwang, but rather for humankind and for a greater purpose. That was my thinking. Doctor, come to Daegu! Please stay well, Dr. Hwang! Please stay well! Please stay strong! We will support you! But the reporters and Professor Hwang's supporters were camping outside my place. It would've been a disaster if I went there. I would've been beaten to death. I've received too many death threats to count. "I'm going to kill you," things like that. They made a lot of threats. I lived on the 13th floor of a 15-story building. And two reporters from a broadcasting company rappelled off the rooftop and came into my place through the window. They took videos of my place, and it was broadcasted on the evening news. Usually, people criticized me. "How could you betray a father-like figure?" In South Korea, officiating somebody's wedding has great importance. It means... that you will be present for the couple throughout the rest of their lives. He asked me to be their officiant, and I willingly did. And one day, he called me and said, "Our first child is born. Would you be the godfather of our first child?" So I paid a visit to them in the hospital to meet their baby, and I became the godfather. The godfather to the newborn child. It was only later that I found out that throughout this time period, he had been constantly exchanging emails about me with MBC's producer, Han Hak-soo. It's not right for people to say I betrayed my mentor by exposing his lies, especially given that we're not family. That is not my definition of betrayal. The word "betrayal"... as understood among scientists, applies only when we betray the truth. I think there is an image of scientists as kind of pure, truth seekers. And for a lot of scientists, I think that's true. It fits. Like, that's why they went into it. Maybe they're smart people. They probably could've made money... more money doing something else. But a lot of them are curious and interested, and they just want to follow that curiosity. But there's also your career to worry about, and scientists, like anybody else, they have to produce results. All scientists face pressure. There's a huge amount of hope and hype around lots of areas of science, and not every scientist in Hwang's position would have done what he did. According to the research paper published in the Science journal, all 11 stem cells have been successfully cultured by the team. However, doubts have been raised within the research team that the cells may have been damaged or were not even stem cells to begin with. A scientist called Anonymous... Well, he's not a scientist anymore. He's a potato farmer now. He's someone who loves science. So at the time, he read Dr. Hwang's paper. When he read it the second time, he came to the realization that the picture Dr. Hwang claimed to be a stem cell was, in fact, manipulated. The additional cell lines, which Professor Hwang and his team have claimed to have established, will undergo DNA analysis to confirm if they are patient-specific somatic cell cloned stem cells. That paper, it had implications for the science of every advanced country on Earth, for the careers of hundreds of thousands of scientists, of graduate students, and postdocs, all of whom would have used that paper as the basis of their own work, and then fail. 23 SAMPLES ANALYZED AT 3 RESEARCH INSTITUTES The Seoul National University investigation committee, who is reevaluating the professor's stem cell research, will be making an announcement shortly. I was the leader of the human research team back then, so I had access to all of the raw data. I was also in charge of drafting our submission to Science academic journal. When I finished it, I passed it along to Dr. Hwang for final approval. He changed the raw data figures as he saw fit, right in front of me, as if he was exercising his authority. He changed the numbers, just like that. He lowered the failure rate and increased the success rate with his red pen. Once he had the figures he wanted, he instructed me to go back and make the formal changes according to his made-up numbers. The 2005 research paper reported that 11 patient-specific stem cell lines were created from somatic cell cloning. However, the truth is that the data of these 11 stem cells was fabricated from only two stem cells. First of all, we have news that is both shocking and devastating. There was a testimony that out of 11 of Professor Hwang Woo-suk's embryonic stem cells, at least nine of them are fake. Please give us a comment. - Please give us just one comment. - Just one word, please. Good evening. We kept hoping it wouldn't be the case, but the first findings from the SNU Internal Review Board regarding Professor Hwang Woo-suk has left the whole nation feeling devastated. Back then, I thought that whatever happened, Dr. Hwang's stem cell research was going to yield some definitive results. I'm not entirely sure what went wrong in the process... But if it is true that he never worked on creating my son's stem cells at all from the very beginning... If he never did the research from the beginning, then he is a terrible person. Science is based on a trust system. And when that trust system breaks down, it must be severely punished, because if it's not, all of science collapses. The moment of downfall for a giant of modern science. For his staff, it was a day of mourning. We have just charged Dr. Hwang Woo-suk without detainment for fraud, embezzlement, and for violating the safety of bioethics law. This office has turned into a wailing venue. The police mobilized three units to block access to the building in case Dr. Hwang's supporters, dissatisfied with the announcement, show extreme behavior. Then later, the PD Note episode finally aired. I watched PD Note together with my son and my wife. After the show, my son turned to his left, looking directly into my eyes, and then he asked me, "Daddy, does that mean I'll never be able to walk again?" And I said... "God will... definitely help you achieve it. It's just... we must believe in God, not ordinary people. So there is no need to despair because of this." Then my son said this. "I know, Dad. I feel the same." And then he cried. After the PD Note episode, regarding Dr. Hwang, not long after... ...my child, uh... passed away. These guys lied, and they, you know, they do, they have to go to jail. But of course, that's not what happens. I mean, scientific fraud is not a crime. There's no real way to put someone in jail for that. You can go on with your career. Dr. Hwang did get in trouble for embezzling grant money that he had. But for scientific fraud? There's no real, uh, way to put someone in jail for that. I ask for forgiveness. I am feeling so ashamed to the point where it is hard to even apologize. Thinking back on the amount of love, all the support, and expectations you had for me, I have no right to be here. I admit to everything, and once again, I give my apologies. Looking back at all of this, the incident taught me a hard lesson and became a milestone not only for me, but for the entire Korean scientific society, and moreover, for the world's scientific circles. It would be cowardly of me to use pressure as an excuse to justify my actions. No one in the world could have pressured me. No one could make me do something like this. That is just... a cowardly excuse. This happened because of my excessive greed. There's no one... no one else that can be blamed but me. However, if I were to be born again, if I were to get the chance to choose the path of my life again, I would choose to take the exact same path. I have very few regrets. I stand behind my contributions to science. I think there are real structural problems in how we have set science up. And I think we often, in the guise of trying to do the best science, encourage misbehavior. I think it's profoundly important that scientists think about ethics, and I've spent my career trying to teach scientists how to think about ethics. All of us, whether we're a scientist, or a plumber, or a baseball player, have to take responsibility for the ethics of our work and the implications of our work on others. Thank you so much for the invitation. You've done so much for the development of paleontology, especially molecular. We really appreciate everything that you have done for us, and for molecular science of the entire Russia. Back in the summer of 2012, I traveled to an excavation site found deep in the Kazachye region, which is in the northeastern area of Siberia. At this time, I felt that I was... the most disgraced that I've ever been in my entire scientific career. After a lot of work, I was recommended for this expedition. If I didn't produce any results from this expedition, I knew that I would never get a second chance. There was a lot of pressure on me. See, all the walls are covered in ice crystals. This is where we found the elbow bone of the young mammoth. This cave is not a naturally occurring cave. It is man-made. The mammoth hunters would... How can I explain it? They would spray water towards the rock in high pressure and slowly but surely, the cave was formed into what you're looking at today. The hunters were only interested in obtaining the mammoth's ivory. But we entered the cave because we wanted the cells. Not the ivory. We were told that the cave was potentially dangerous. That it could collapse. Okay. - I did it. - Sir, we need to go. - What? Why? - We have to leave. - Now. - Why do we have to retract? Why? We have to retract because the entrance... The entrance is collapsing right now. - Oh, really? - Yes. - Okay. - Do we have to... Do we have to go this way? Okay, let's go out. Let's go. Okay. My... My sample. My sample, my sample. Okay. If the cave had collapsed, everyone on the inside would have been stuck. There would have been no possibility of rescue. Everyone would've died. At that specific time, I was ready to give my life. To sacrifice everything for my work. I was... I was very committed to that. I have lived enough for a lifetime. If I went there for the purpose of fulfilling a scientific goal, and my life was cut short due to an accident? Then I think it would've been meaningful. I am dedicated to this cause and I can't see myself shying away from danger. This small room has enough high-precision equipment to complete the first steps toward the creation of a mammoth clone. Overseeing the process was a professor at Sooam Korean Biomedical Technology Foundation, Hwang Woo-suk. Among the samples we obtained, we found muscle samples with traces of blood. This was the moment where we thought, "We might finally be realizing our dream." These were some of the pictures from that time. From there, as long as we can find one single living cell, that's it. Confidentially speaking, we already have the live cells. If the mammoth project is successful and if the Russian government agrees, I want to put a few mammoths between South Korea and North Korea. It would be a symbol of how science and technology can bring people together. It would be the initiation of the reunification of the two countries. Using cloning for species preservation or conservation, or de-extinction, as they call it. There are many problems with it. One is that it's very resource intensive. Another is that if you're cloning, you're going to have this kind of, inbreeding. By definition, you're going to have genetically identical animals which doesn't help with the kind of long-term sustainability of that species. A creature brought back through cloning isn't really what that creature is. That creature existed in an ecosystem and in a time that gave all kinds of familial and territorial and coexistence with other animals' context to its life. And now, you're just bringing it back outside of that context. What is a Tyrannosaurus Rex outside of the Jurassic period? It's just some simulacrum, some pretend of a, of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Here we go. Csillo, come! Time to go. Let's put your... your first body in the Earth. Clone my dog is the best thing, what I did to my life. People are writing, "Oh, you're playing God" or "It's not the same dog." They're all negative. Everybody asks the same question. "It is genetically the same, but its character must be different." And actually, I would always answer that it's the same dog. Because cloning a dog and putting it in the same environment, the same family, with the same kids around, he will be behaving exactly the same as the first one. I don't see I cloned him. He is Csillo, he came back. He actually survived death. This cloning process is very powerful and can help a lot of people. Cloning is really only reincarnation. Reproduces the body which is gone. Yes, I think it is very, very useful to do this. Here lays your first body. And... you'll take over his role. It's very strange for me because Csillo is now big. I feel he's really replacing him completely, so actually, for me, it's like saying, "You, you take now over, his role." And we finally found a place where he can rest in peace. In a world first, Chinese researchers have cloned two healthy monkeys by using the same technique that produced Dolly the sheep two decades ago. The barrier of cloning primate species is now overcome. In principle, any primate, including humans, can be cloned. Let's face it, technology's controversial all the time. I'm sure the motorcar was controversial. They were upset it was scaring horses, you know. I think everything... everything we do is controversial at some stage. I lost two daughters when they were very young. And the first one, Anya... Basically though, I mean, I'll never forget how it affected me. I mean, it affects me to this day. And I actually held her in my arms when they disconnected her. And if somebody turned around and said to me, "Hey, we can clone her and we'll get her back." She hadn't really had a chance to develop a personality. She was going to be identically, genetically the same. She was going to be my daughter. Would I say yes? And... I'd have to say I would. There's nothing worse than small coffins. So is there a role for cloning in humans? I might argue, in very select cases. Now, if somebody said to me, "Would you like to be cloned?" I'm going to be cremated. No one's bringing me back from nowhere. No one's playing with my DNA. Science often gallops way ahead of the ethics. And ethics plays catch-up because scientists are out there doing these experiments and then occasionally, they come up with something, and we have to say, "Whoa, whoa, wait a second. We need to talk about this." Unfortunately, often it's just the ethicists saying that. No one listens to us. But, um, sometimes, that conversation becomes very serious. Sometimes, we manage to get people to listen and say, "This is coming down the pike, and we really need to pay attention to it." Korea is the country where I was born. So... I feel at ease every time I come back from abroad, even if it is only once or twice a year. Pastor. Welcome. - How have you been? - Oh, goodness. Pastor. Your face has not changed one bit. You're also the same, Pastor. My goodness. Let's head in. You look even younger. Yes, Pastor, I've been really wanting to see you. Hyeon-yi is someone I can never forget. The noble promises I made with Hyeon-yi. I hope that you will continue to keep the promise you made with Hyeon-yi in your heart as you've done so far. There are so many Hyeon-yi situations out there, right? Yes, there are so many in the same predicament. I believe you have... been given the mission to help them. Among those people who criticize the use of cloning technology... some say that cloning is against the will of God, against Mother Nature, and natural creation. Some say it's an extravagant attempt to play God. But, how can anyone definitively claim that this... that this really is God's realm?
