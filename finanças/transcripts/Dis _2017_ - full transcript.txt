No, some things'll never change. What did you did? What the fuck are you doing here? Ain't you supposed to be in the sandbox? Good to see you too, brother. I'm serious. What'd you do this time, you little bastard? I don't wanna talk about it right now, all right? Shit. You know why I'm here. Oh yeah, welcome to the underworld. There's gonna be a few things we're gonna have to spit back and forth a little later. Fine, but right now, I gotta get a shower. Damn. I thought you'd never say that. What's this? Chill. It's just dessert. Fly in the ointment. Devil's root. Now you. No, no. Where'd you get this? Got it from the witch. The witch almost killed Sophia. In my opinion, it was a dry belly and the blues that did her in. The witch was trying to save her, you know? You even know where that stuff comes from? It comes from the woods, the no-no part of the woods. Supposedly, they grow from the jizz of a hanged killer. That's one way of looking at it. There are darker versions too. Some are saying men, women, even children are turning into plants. Fact is, people have gone missing. And the mandrakes are blooming. There something you wanna tell me? Right after you left, Sophia had a breakdown. She used a woodcutter to cut her leg. Which leg? The fuck you think? Which leg she fucking cut? Which leg? What leg? The dry leg. Really? Then what happened? I told you. She was doing fine. By damn, you had her back at her gig, didn't you? You had her gigging after that shit. I didn't know you were coming back. I didn't know and Sophia's gone. What do you mean? Where'd she go? There's nothing there. There's just a shell. We tried to help her, I swear to you. I swear to you by my, by our mother's grave. Oh, Jesus. Who are you? Oh, not again, fuck. I can't feel my legs. What the hell did you give me? You son of a bitch. I'm freezing. Freezing. No. What the fuck are you gonna do with that? No. No. No! No! No! What's in the water? You expect me to drink that again? I'd rather die first. Who are you? Jesus. Come on. Come on, come on, cunt! Okay. Okay. Okay. You happy, bitch? Let's get married and then have babies. Yes, it's okay. Shhh. Momma's never gonna leave you. ♪ Hush little baby ♪ Don't you cry Yeah, oh, yes, momma loves you so much. Mmmm. You will not fear the terror of night or the owl that flies by day. Or the pestilence that starts the darkness. Or the plague that destroys everything. I know what you are. Subtitles by explosiveskull
