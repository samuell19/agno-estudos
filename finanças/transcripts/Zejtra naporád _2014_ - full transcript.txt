Stop! -Stop, you asshole! -Do you see that guy? -That’s me. -Stop! Everything got all messed up and it couldn’t have been prevented. Or it could have, but it all started somewhere completely different. “I WAS JUST AT...” All the truly important things are in our dreams. That’s why I’m here. “WESTIN HOTEL ZHEJIANG PROVINCE, CHINA” What am I doing here? I’m the middleman. Want something from China, India, Bangladesh? I’ll find it. Clothes, toys, talking calculators, plastic Jesus clocks. Whatever. Nowadays, things need to be done cheap. Best is for free. That’s why people travel around the world, like me. For the West to live on. For us to have enough. And wanting to do well, I take what I get. Right now, I’ve got this one guy. He’s a bit crazy and it isn’t smart to mess with him. But hey, do or die. No matter what you do, The balls always find the hole. Adadas... I’ve been waiting for this deal. To set me in the right direction. To be able to fulfill my dreams. I spend weeks, months, years here. I live on the go, in airports, hotels. I don’t like sitting down, a mortgage to pay, trudging on to and from work. I have no wife, still plenty of time for kids. I spend my lonely nights talking to girls far away. I’ve chosen three of them to meet when I get back. I’ll deliver the stupid Adadas shirts, get my money and maybe meet someone who’ll change my life. PRESENTS A RUDOLF HAVLIK FILM STARRING ALL MY TOMORROWS MUSIC SOUND EDITING CAMERA PRODUCER SCREENPLAY DIRECTOR So what are you hauling in this time? China again, huh? -Hey, I got you... -What the hell man, not here. Come here... Thanks. But next time somewhere else. Everything’s changing here, man. They’re cracking down on us. Nice. Fuck! Shit. And I can kiss my dreams goodbye. -It can’t be. -So are you going to take this stuff? They’re all fucked up. Hey, when it’s got tits or from Asia, there are always problems, right? I need you to hold it for a bit longer. -Are you crazy? -Just for two... -Have you gone mad or what? Come here, one week. Not a day longer. -Are we clear? -I gotta go. Awesome. I know just what he’ll say. Where’s my money? We sit down all nice, then his henchmen follow me and knock the life out of me. They said not to take the job, but well, I’m smart and know what’s best for me. What now? Hello? Did you forget about me or what? Could you please come already? -Now? -No, in a week. I’ve been waiting for an hour already. Shit. Hi, sorry. Could you please explain to me... Why is it, that after a few weeks, you all treat us like total idiots. Tereza. Someone I can tell almost everything to. The therapist of my life, who can get practically anything out of me. We sit together at cafes. She always has a latte. She wants me to do yoga also because otherwise I’ll have a heart attack. And men, she’s not afraid to let them have it. From the start, I was his true love, he wouldn’t trade me for anything. And then I see him in a bar with some skinny, flat-chested bitch. I see. Just tell me what’s new with you. -When was the time it wasn’t so shitty. -What happened? Oh nothing, I’ll manage it somehow. But I’ve got to get away for a few days. -Where to? -I arranged some blind dates for myself. -Blind dates? So you’ve given up on love. I’m stupid, telling you my problems. Sorry. You’ll find someone better, you’ll see. -I feel horrible. -What are we going to do about that? You go and enjoy your dates. I’ve got a better idea. It’s so beautiful. I always come here when I need to clear my head. I don’t get why you need to go on blind dates when you’ve got this here. -Meeting someone you don’t even know. -I don’t know. I just thought about it. I told myself it was the best answer. I enjoy it, clean my head and we’ll see. Maybe you’re right. Maybe even I could use a little of that. -And what about your father? -My father? He doesn’t have time for anything. He’s getting ready for my brother’s wedding. -Oh. -But he asks about you. Like how work is and whatnot. Yea, work. -Everything ok? Petr! -Work’s going. Petr, look at me. Petr, I know you... -You’re so weird! -It’s great, jump in. -No way. -Come on, Tereza! -Fuck! -Jump. Give me your hand. Here, here. I’d like to live like you. Traveling, no worries. -I’ve always got something to worry about, really. -You? -Yea, me. -Such as? -Look at how I live. No long-term relationship. -That is true. No one could stand you. -Oh, come on. -You’re always gone. But maybe there’s a surprise waiting for you. -Yea? -Mm. -How do you choose the girls? -From the photo. They send some photos. You’re a pervert. Hey, so are you feeling better? -I’m alright. -You see. So, my options, have them remade? Unrealistic. File a complaint? In China. How? I’ll think of something and then kill myself. “ARE YOU BACK? LET’S GO FOR A DRINK!” FROM: PAVEL HORAK You’re just like counterfeit money, always in circulation. But before you fly off to somewhere, -we’ve got to go out and get drunk again. -Definitely. -Is that clear? Pavel, you can always rely on him. If I’ve ever been unreliable, lax, or immoral, he’s the exact opposite. You know the guy all women love because he does everything right. That’s him. -Only it’s not fake. -You’ve gotta be kidding me. Fellas, you dug the hole on the wrong side. Fuck. Fuck... -I got this great idea. -You don’t say. Go on. I arranged a few blind dates with girls I know from the Internet. -Dude. -They could be quite good and some are getting kinda serious. You’re crazy man. Girls from the internet are monsters. -Oh fuck that. -Oh, that wouldn’t interest me one bit. -So, do you have any favorites? -I wrote them, saying I was home, and... -By chance... -I’ll be in the area and we could meet up. I enjoy it. So we’ll see. -When are you leaving? -Tomorrow. So, to you. Cheers. Here, here. -Hey. -Hey there. Are you going with me? -Of course. -I remember you talking about your dates. -Yea. And I have a girlfriend, who is great and if nothing works out, so I could set up a date for you two. Of course. What’s she like? She, she is really tolerant. -A great girl. -Sounds good. Wait! I’ve got a picture here. Here she is... Not bad, huh? Kinda plump, isn’t she? -You don’t like her? -No, it’ll be good... -What? -It’ll be good. So think about it and let me know so I can set it up. Ok? -And water my flowers, please. -You mean the two you have? I’ve got three. Finish school, find a job, find a wife, buy a TV, get a mortgage, have kids, sit on your ass, and don’t think for yourself. I don’t want to live like that. It’s never interested me. I like when I don’t know what to expect. The uncertainty when I don’t know what the next day will bring. For me, accountants are like wives. I’m often hiding from ours. -No, you aren’t. -Yep, I swear. Yea, ok. Hey, so what’s it like in Hong Kong? Hong Kong is amazing, something like an overcrowded London covered in Chinatowns. And every Sunday, the Filipinos go out and have a picnic. You can’t even move there. Ridiculously crowded. Sorry. -Hello, this is Petr Kraus. -Hi. -Oh, hi Tereza. -Since when do you call me Tereza? -Sorry, I didn’t know it was you. Of course, you’re there with one of them, huh? That’s so sad. Listen, don’t let people disturb you, you sex fiend. Ok, thank you. That was just my secretary. What? Secretary? Hello? Are you going home tonight? Two shots, thanks. And when’s the next time you leave? And will you take me with you? And are you vaccinated? Against you? There is no serum for me yet. -It was hot in there. -I still wanted to dance. You’re cute. Good evening. Twenty, uh 304. That’s my secretary. -I don’t normally do this. -That’s what they all say. -I’ve been with my boyfriend six years. -This one too. You’re all the same, just wanna fuck. You make me sick. Don’t touch it. A thief too, huh? Our entire world is based on lies. Business, relationships, sex. We lie at work, at home, to ourselves. Over and over, and we don’t even know why. If we all just began telling the truth, the world would likely end that day. They told us you shouldn’t lie, but they didn’t tell us how to survive. Hey, so how was the date? -You’re prying. -No, I’m just asking. How’d it turn out? -Well, that depends. -God, depends on what? Well, it just somehow went bad. And I’m all scratched up and stuff. -You were in a fight somewhere? -No, no fight, but... Doesn’t matter. Just didn’t work out. Getting something out of you is a real art, pal. -Mm, and how are you? -I’m great, really. Listen, I wanted to ask if you wanted to go to the wedding. It’s on your way and my father would be really happy. -Yea, I could go. And when is it? -Saturday, Saturday, you coming? -Yea, sure. -And by the way, -my friend is really excited to meet you. -Yea, tell her hi. Yea, I will. See ya. The idiot doesn’t answer. Is this fucker just playing with me or what? Hey, go and find out what’s going on. Three million down the drain. Every night, a million people fall asleep with the desire to change their lives, but they never do it. Tomorrow I’ll stop smoking. Tomorrow I’ll quit my job. Tomorrow I’ll break up with her. Tomorrow I’ll be a better person. And then the morning comes and nothing’s changed. And maybe even that’s why I’m running away. From myself and my own bullshit. I’ll get lost on a blank spot on a map, believing tomorrow things’ll change. That it’ll be better and everything will be alright again. Shit! Son of a bitch. Fuck. Shoo. Get on out. Son of a bitch. Hm? What? -What the hell man. -Hey, listen. I need you to come and get me. Are you nuts? Do you know what time it is? -Yea, I know, but I’m in a jam. -Fine, I’ll come. Where are you? -Somewhere near Prachatice. -What? Dude, why don’t you call your dad. He lives there somewhere, doesn’t he? Because my dad hasn’t had a... you know... -...phone for ten years. So are you coming? -Fine, I’m on my way. -And hurry up. I can’t climb off the roof. -Yea, I’m coming. What, from what roof? For Christ’s sake. Hey, what’d you do this time? Wow, nice job. Are you alright? The car also looks fine. Wow.. -Did someone take a shit in here? -Yep. Hey, isn’t this yours? Just as well. It’s for nothing. Throw it away. Don’t be stupid. It could go with something. How’d the date end up? -She scratched me. -Wait, you took her straight to bed? -If only you saw what I have on my back. -Go on, show me. -Forget it, do you have a rope? -Of course I do, Romeo, a rope and even a first aid kit if necessary. Yea, this is all fucked up, man. You have to do something with the bumper. Where are you going to sleep? I’m going to my dad’s and we’ll do something about it in the morning. Ok, whatever you say. I’ll go for the rope. -Be careful. Drive safely. -Yes, father. -And ring me. -Sure, hey thanks a lot. -See ya. -See ya. -To Třebíč. -Yea, have a seat. Thanks. I think it’s gonna rain. -Don’t you want to put it in the back? -That’s ok. Ok, fine. -Anyways, I’m Petr. -Andrea. Why do I always stop? So, what’s in Třebíč? I’m going to my boyfriend’s. -Oh. -Do you have a girlfriend? -No, not now. You’re waiting for the right one, huh? I guess you could say that. Men. Do you work in the forest? No, why? I was just thinking. So your boyfriend is from Třebíč, huh? He doesn’t want to introduce me to his folks. That they wouldn’t understand it. I don’t know what they should understand about it. I think he’s got a girlfriend. -Well, it is weird, but... -It’s weird, it’s fuckin weird. -Hey, calm down. -I’m not going to. Stop staring at me. He keeps staring. The whole world has gone mad. -You know what? I’m not gonna give a shit about him. -Please put that away. -This time, I’m just not gonna give a shit. -Ok, put that away. -Get back, I’m gonna start it up. Leave me alone. -Don’t do that here. -Leave me alone. -Turn it off. Fuck, turn it off. Fuckin shit. -It doesn’t seem to be right to me yet. -Fellas, I’m looking for Petr Kraus. Come on, where are you with the tub? Chop chop. What do you want with him? -He’s got our order... -C’mon, we don’t have all day. -...and I can’t reach him. -I don’t know where he is. -Be careful. -I can’t help you with this, bud. -Would you like to think it over. -Watch out! Fuckin shit, have you gone mad? Here on site, you can get hurt real easy if you’re not careful. -Pick it up. -Whatever you say. Guys, what the hell. Is this your first day on the job or something? What happened to the tub? You know, sometimes you have the feeling everything’s all fucked up. Yea. And the point is. You’re never in so deep to not get out. There’s always a way, maybe to somewhere else, but there is. Maybe you find another girl... or guy, and he’ll be the one. You’re right. Fuck him. -So, shall we go, bud? -Yea. -Let’s put this in the back, ok? -Probably best. -Thanks a lot. -No problem. -Sorry about that. -It’s alright. I need to give you the chainsaw. -No, no, no, leave it. -Don’t be ridiculous. -No, really. -Alright. -Good luck. -You too. Hey, why didn’t you tell me you got yourself in some shit. -Don’t be ridiculous. -I’m being ridiculous? Some guy’s looking for you. -You brought him some shirts back from China. -Except they’re all fucked up. You’re fuckin with me. That’s bad. Listen, you’ve gotta call them, otherwise they’ll come after you. You can’t run away from this. -I know. I just need to think how to fix them. -Fix them? You can’t fix them. -You just have to remake them or I don’t know. -It must be possible. -Wait a sec. Hey guys. Are you having a party over there? Go do something. Ok, I’m coming over. We need to think of something. Where are you? I’m going to a concert in Všemokrousy. What? Všemokrousy? Alright, I’ll put it in the GPS. Maybe I’ll find it. Later. You were right, boss. He’s already left. I said it, balls to the hole. He’ll lead you to him. How many people do you really get to know in your life? How many times do we fall in love? How many times do we break up? How many times do we start over? I believe there exists another half for each of us in this world. A part we aren’t complete without. And when you go far enough away, you find we’re similar. We want the same things that aren’t so difficult. We just complicate the path ourselves. -What do you want? I’m paying. -Peppermint? -Again? -I get pretty wild after it. -Ok, I’ll have one two. -Two peppermints. -We got no money. -So what. -No place to live. -So what. -We’re incapable. -So what. -We know no laws. -So what. We’re a mere nation of a younger generation. We’re only puppets of an older jubilation. We’re under the rule of the incompetent swine. We don’t want to rule. We aren’t their brine. -We got no money. -So what. -No place to live. -So what. -We’re incapable. -So what. -We know no laws. -So what. -What’s that noise? -Hey Teri. It’s a band, open air... Open air! -Yea, I’m here and listening to it. -Did you forget about the wedding? What? What wedding? Tomorrow we’re going to a wedding. My brother’s getting married. -Oh, is it tomorrow already? -Tomorrow is the wedding dammit. Good, so we’re coming. We’ll meet there, good? Did you forget? No, just slipped my mind, because... it just slipped my mind. Would you be so kind, sorry, so kind and write me everything? How long will you be there? Where will you sleep? Don’t tell me at her place. I don’t know where yet. -You really are unbelievable. -It doesn’t matter though, does it? I need you to pick up my uncle from Brno. He won’t fit in my car. Uncle? Sure, I’ll do that. Whatever you wish. Good, and don’t drink so much. And be careful. My uncle’s a diagnosed kleptomaniac, so don’t give him anything, ok? -Ok, I’ll be careful of him. -Bye. -Bye. -Why’d you tell him Karel’s a kleptomaniac? -I, I don’t know. I wanted to have some fun with him. And you know what it’ll be like if he’s looking after him all day. I don’t know. I think it’s just pretty stupid. -What? Are you upset? -I’m not upset. Why should I be? Upset. So I’m, so I’m, I’m stupid, ok. Smoked a lot, lungs were fine. That’s gone. That’s gone. That’s gone. -Yea, so...? -So? Shall we go to your place or mine? -Yours. I don’t live here, remember? -Oh yea. -I’ll sleep in my car. -Don’t be stupid. You could sleep at my place. -Well, I don’t know. You think? -Yea. -Shit. -What is it? -It’s my boyfriend, you idiot. -Boyfriend? You have a boyfriend? -Yea. -This’ll be interesting. Are you having fun, love? -Zygy, please don’t be stupid. -I’m not. Someone else here is though. -Hey, don’t. -Shut your face. You fucked up, dude. You thought you’d fuck my girl, did you? Stop it. -And you, you little slut. -Nothing happened. Leave her alone. Beat it or I’ll take you down. Come here, come on. -Go. -Don’t touch me. -Go. God, you look... Wow man. I couldn’t find this place. -Ouch. -Are you ok? -But do I have all my teeth? -I’ve got the feeling that... -I don’t know. Did you used to have two? You’re stupid. Hey, you think you’ll be able to start taking care of yourself again in a week? -It really wasn’t my fault. -Yea, I know. Never is. Was that her, the redhead? Yea, she just forgot to tell me she had a crazy boyfriend. Haha, women. Hey, let’s get out of here. -Fuck. -Before the heroes call the cops. Pricks. I don’t know how you could’ve screwed up like this. I underestimated it a bit. So you’ll give them back their money, and that’s it, right? I don’t have that much. I paid the Chinese. Ok, so you’re fucked. Can’t you fix it somehow? No. And if I could, do know how much it’d cost? There must be some way. Hold up... -Did you hear that? -What? -Wait. Shh. -Fellas. -The fucker must’ve been following me. -What are we gonna do with him? -We kill him. -Are you nuts? -It was a joke. We’ll knock him out and toss him somewhere. Ok, but I’ve never knocked anyone out before. It can’t be too hard. It’s in all the films. Wait. Trade me places. I’m a righty. -Wait. -What? -Be careful not to really kill him. -That’s easy for you to say. -That probably wasn’t hard enough. -You try it, Mr. Know-It-All. -He keeps looking at me all weird. -Do it. -Hm, ok. -Move aside. Wait, I’ve got an idea. Yea, that’ll be good. Hold his head. -Ok. -Tight. -Wait, wait. -Watch out for your fingers. Wow, this guy can withstand a lot. -Hey. -What? -We need to be careful to not do anything to him. -That’s the point, isn’t it? -Well, yea but... But what? Should I untie him so he can bust open your mouth? Huh? Here, hold this. I’ll look to see what I’ve got in the car. -Too small, huh? -What the... -My wife. -Alright, look. -That’s probably too much. What do you mean too much? I really don’t know wh... And there you go. What now? Well... Get up, get up, get up, get up. Oh, it’s you. -Get up. -Wait. -So what’s the plan? -I’m going to a wedding today. -You’re getting married? -No, Tereza’s brother. Poor guy. But I don’t know if I should cancel it, since I’d rather sort out this mess. Just the same we won’t come up with anything now. When do you have to have this sorted out by? I’ve got a meeting with them in Ostrava in two days. So we still have time. Go to the wedding. Maybe something will come to us till then. Careful. -Will you handle it? -Yea. -Hello. I’m sorry to bother you. -I don’t have any change. No, that doesn’t matter. Are you by chance Mr. Petr? -Hello, I am. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. The same to you. I’m Karel, the uncle. Tereza said you’d be waiting for me. -Yea, ok. -So this goes in the trunk, right? “Balvinova 47. I’m waiting on a bench. From: Jana Hlavata” Thank you. You’re very kind. -I really like it here. What’s this? -What? -What you have here. -Yea, that’s a phone. -Oh, and could I search around on it? -No, it doesn’t work. -No, why not? -I need to charge it because it’s dead. -But I just want to look. -No, it still wouldn’t interest you. It’s hard to use. It’s all, it’s kinda... It’s kinda strange. -Oh, so why do you have it? -Me? -Yea. -Yea. -I have it, well. -Uh huh. Because before I buy, get something else, better, so I’ve got this. -That’d probably be pretty expensive, huh? -Yea, terribly, a real, real lot. Well, I couldn’t afford that. You know I’m retired. I’d only... I could only steal it from somewhere. -Hi. -Hi. -Sorry about the complication. -It’s ok. I’m just glad to see you in real life. And now we’re going to a wedding. This’ll be funny. Yea, it will. And we’re also taking the uncle we need to deliver in one piece. -Hello. -Nice to meet you. -I’m Karel Sebral, the uncle. -Jana, nice to meet you. -A little gift for you. -It’s for me? Thank you. -I’ll buy another at the gas station. -So, I’ll sit in back. -I’ll open to door for you. You know, gentlemen. Back then, there weren’t any combines, in the morning dad went out with horses to the field and we’d have to help him. There wasn’t any TV, radio either. Just a crystal radio receiver. I remember my grandpa had one. Yea, and the guys and I would spin tops around all day. -Why did we make a turn? -I’ve gotta put on my suit. Mine’s been on for a while already. -And you look real handsome. -Yea? Thank you. -I’d rather stay in the car. -You can’t. -Why can’t I? -I have to lock it. -Oh, ok. The alarm doesn’t work. When I... When someone’s sitting in the car, anyone, and I leave, it beeps like mad. -It’s broken. -Ok, fine. So I’ll go with you all. -What was that all about. -The guy’s a kleptomaniac. -What? I didn’t wanna leave him alone in the car so he wouldn’t steal something. -I’ve never seen a kleptomaniac before. -That’s funny. -What’s that on your forehead? Were you in a fight? -No, I wasn’t. -Just had some trouble, that’s all. -Oh. -But it wasn’t my fault. -Here, pretty nice scrape there. I’ll clean you up. -No, that’s not necessary. -Hey, I’m a nurse. You have nothing to be afraid of. I’m not going to bite you. But it will sting a bit. -Tell me why you men are always fighting. -I don’t fight. I see that. Would you fight for me? Of course. Right here right now. You’ve really entertained me in the short while we’ve known each other. First the wedding. Then the stealing uncle, and now this. What’s next in your plan? I’d like to take a piss before we go. Well, you can manage that without me. -Yea. -Is that all? Two hundred twenty-five. Did you raise your prices? Not yet, but it’s with the flower and chocolate the man with you took. The man, huh? -Do you want our discount card? -No thanks. I’ll make my own at home. -Bye. -Goodbye. -A one-thirty. -Let’s go. -Let’s go! -I have to go. Nice to meet you and I hope it treats you well. Alright. May you be as sweet as springtime love. -Thank you. -Glad to. Hope you like it. -Except you forgot to pay for it. -What? -For your springtime love. Gosh, it slipped my mind. When I see a beautiful lady, I forget everything. -I’ll pay you right now. -No, it’s ok. -No, no, no, no. So, where was I? So there was Fanda Šiška, Pepík Roubavý, Olda... Good, they’re here. We don’t know each other so well, but may I offer you my arm also? -Ah, and the sad hero of the day. -Hi, Petr. -Stupid blabber. -Nice to meet you. -You should go see Tereza. She’s kinda nervous. -Karel, how was the journey? -It was a little strange. -Yea? -We should buy the groom a shot. -No, no. He’ll pay. -He’ll pay? We’ll see you later. In a bit. -I have to get a drink. -Your ex? -What? Who? -Tereza. -No, we’re friends. She freaks out pretty often. Good. Because I won’t let any exes take you today. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony. I hate weddings. Groups of well-dressed people pretending it’ll be forever. As if the vow should change everything. As if till then the feelings weren’t real. Faust’s deal with the Devil, which says only a chosen few can be successful. Then everyone gets drunk, fights, and argues like crazy. Probably what’s awaiting me. -Do you want to dance? -Hi, Teri. Sure. -You know I hate that name. -Ouch. Ouch? Hope you don’t come apart. You look awful. -Thank you. -Who is she? -Who was he? -Who is she? One of them, right? -Uh huh. She’s pretty. I don’t even know her. I had Uncle Karel, so we didn’t have much time. -And what all did you want time for? -Nothing, just saying I don’t know her. -Yea, and you were right. He wanted to steal my phone. -Who? -Who else? Karel. -Karel isn’t a kleptomaniac. -What? -I made it up. -You’re joking, right? -No. I thought it’d be funny. -You deserved it. -For what? -For what? -You didn’t call. -My God. I made an idiot of myself. It was just a joke. Have you chosen one yet? Why do you have to be so mean? Why are you never nice? -What? -What exactly is it you want? -I’m never nice? -Yes. What do you want? So I didn’t call. I was drunk or driving, and was thinking about something else. I don’t know. You’re always a hard-ass. Why don’t you go harp on your own idiot? I am mean, yea. Me, who’s always afraid when you’re dragging your ass around the world. Me, who sits at home waiting like some bitch if your plane’s going to land. Me, who listens to your bullshit about where you are or the skank you slept with. And me, who loves you, even though you act like a real idiot sometimes. So listen up, you’re an arrogant asshole. I’m sorry, from the bottom of my heart, and you can go all over Europe, all over Czech, but when you act this stupid, you’ll never find anyone. Anyone. Goodbye. -Hi, Petr. -Hi. -So, how’s it going? -Well, everything’s pretty much fucked up. -Yea. Something’s happening and I’m the only one who doesn’t know about it. Hey, Tereza’s a bit strange. We’ve both known a long time. She sometimes does stupid things. I have the feeling now it has something to do with you. She never allows others to speak badly about you and now this. I did nothing. I just didn’t call her, ok. She’s not my mother. How many times in your life have you not called someone? -And then yells at you like a little kid. -She’ll get over it. She takes after her mother. There’s that Slovak temperament. Gentlemen, if you all, might I join in? -I just wanted to... -Of course, Karel. We’re just solving woman problems. -Yea. -Women, women. -Yea. You know, I was curious what Asian lovers were like. -Oh, Karel. Come on, stop it. -No, really? -You’re... No, that’s really alright. Completely unshaven. Their legs. Not even there. Even though you’re far from home, you still put up with a lot, huh? -What are you all talking about? -What are we talking about? About hair growth. Wish I hadn’t asked. Dad, do you know where Aunt Klara is? I don’t know, but last I saw her, she was climbing into the fountain. Thanks. Don’t drink too much. Tereza, can I tell you something? Today you look very very pretty. Thank you very much. At least someone noticed. -Gentlemen, she takes after her mother. -Yep. -And what about their armpits? There’s a beautiful sky tonight. -Do you see that constellation there? -Mm. Yea. Orion. -You know your way around stars? -My dad tried to teach me. He knows all of them. I remember just this one. -Jana, I... -Don’t say anything. I’d like to explain something to you. Explain? Go ahead. What number I am and how much higher I can get on your list? In bed, or even elsewhere. It’s not like that. So how is it? I... it’s not easy. But every person is looking for someone. And what does it look like with me? I don’t know yet. You do? Maybe I do. And what about Tereza? We’ve known each other since we were kids. She helps me. I help her. -You really are blind, aren’t you? -What? You know, all this. The wedding, stars, pond, a great guy. I like all of this. It’s exactly what I’d like. But there’s one problem with it. The guy should be sitting next to Tereza not with me. Because she wants that. -That’s ridiculous. Nonsense. -Believe me. I’m a girl. Maybe I don’t know everything, but this I know. Look, I’m sitting here with you, not Tereza. -She just told me to go, you know where? -Yea. Do these things happen often? Yea. In the last four days, about four times. You wanna go lie down? Ok. But I hope it’s clear nothing’s going to happen. I’m not just another notch on your bedpost. Don’t worry. After this crazy week, I’d be grateful for that. Wait. -Ouch. -You should get it some air. And so if I don’t find the money, they’re gonna skin me alive. -Wow. -And that’s what it’s like with me. -Stupid T-shirts. -That’s really a big mess. -Don’t worry. You’ll manage it. So, see ya. -See ya. -Call sometime. -See ya. Bye. -Fuck. -Hello, sir. Can I see your license, please? Yea. -Nice. -Hello. Hi, do you know why I stopped you? -No, I don’t. -Any idea? -No idea. -No idea? -No idea. You should have an idea. No idea what law it could be? You should have an idea why I’m here. This is a no parking zone. -Oh, but I was just... -Yea, there’s the sign. Over there. So what are we gonna do about it? Let it slide? Let it slide? -Great. -What’s great? That you’re going to pay it? -I’ll pay it. -Yea, ok, have a seat. Wait. I’ll write the ticket. -I hope you’ll do something about the bumper. -At the shop. -And the window also. -That too. Stop. Stop, asshole. Stop. Stop, asshole. You fucking asshole. Get out. You fucking asshole. Get out of the car, asshole. What’s going on here, bud? Making me look like an idiot. Get out. Come on. -Didn’t you see... -Hands on the roof. -Didn’t you see... -Yea, I saw it. -You saw the guy stealing my car, right? -Don’t move. You’re going nowhere. Can you let me go to the bathroom? Fuck. Where is he? Boo. Yea, he’s taking it bad. Psychologically mainly. So, Mr. Kraus, sign here. Here are the keys to your vehicle. It’s in the impound lot. You go there now. I’m talking to you. Pick up the vehicle and of course you’ll pay for the towing. Of course. Pretty, pretty, pretty. -How’d you do it? -Me? I didn’t. -So who then? -The idiot. -So I should thank him then now. -Mm, yea, you can. He brought me. -Thanks. -No problem. It was nothing. -You got another cigarette? Thank you. -Could you drop me off at the impound lot? -Sure, get in. -You wanna go out for dinner? -Yea, sure. -Yea, sure. Oh. Allow me. Scumbag. Fuck. There exists a very thin line where it stops being all fun and games. And I just crossed this line. This needs to stop. Here and now. -They brought in a guy from a crash about an hour ago. -One moment. -Are you related? -No, we aren’t. We’re not allowed to give information to people who aren’t related. -But I’m the guy who pulled him out of the car. -I understand you, but... No! You don’t understand. I want to know how he is. If you did, you’d tell me. -We’re not allowed to give information. -You can’t do anything. Nobody can. In this fucked up world, nobody can do anything. Because we’re controlled by these idiotic rules. -Sir, I’m going to have to call security. -What else. -Hi. -Hi. First off, don’t yell at me. I want to apologize and thank you for your help. And I, I’d like to talk to you. -I’m listening. -But not on the phone. -Don’t you think it’s too late for that? -No, I don’t. -We just need to talk. -Ok, go on that date. -I will, but... -Don’t say anything. See you after. -Good. -Good night. Drive carefully or I’ll go mad. Bye. Fuck. You’re a good girl. Come on, come here. Come here, good girl. Come here. Yea, that’s a good girl. Stay. Good girl. Come here. Let’s go. Fetch. Sir, get up. You can’t sleep here. What an asshole. -Yea, this is Petr Kraus. -Wonderful. We should talk. -I’m coming to your place. -Stop on by. -Hey. -Hey, I thought of something. -It’s no use. I’ll just confess and solve it somehow. -I’ve got a solution. Ok. -What? -I have... I’ll come to you. Where you at? -I’m already in Ostrava. -Good, wait there. Send me the address, ok? -I got this for you, honey, didn’t I? -Yes. -From Jablonec. He doesn’t want to. Give him a nudge. What the hell. No. You see, Rany. Every ball finds its hole, right? You thought if you hide, you win, huh? I... I’ll do something about it. I’m not just in the textile business. I also have a slaughterhouse if you’re interested. -What kind of house? -Slaughterhouse. Go on. Move, move. God, what’s this supposed to be? Pretty good, huh? I could sell that. -How many you got? -A full container. They’re just messed up like this one. So what are we going to do with you? Quite a pickle we’re in. I tried to think of something. -But this is good, isn’t it? -Lucky you have friends who think for you. Fine, I’ll buy it. Untie him. But I want the originals even. WhenI take my dog out, I want us to look good. -When can you get them made for me? -I can arrange it right away. So get up, do it, and bring them over. And don’t make me look for you. -Scram! -Let’s get out. Come here, come here. -Does your car run? -Mm. But it’s pretty banged up. If you’d just listened to me, we could have spent all week drinking in peace. -When do you fly out? -Right away. I’ll buy a plane ticket and... Don’t screw it up again, ok? -Hey, could you do something for me? -What? I was supposed to have one more date, right in our cafe. I’m not going instead of you. No, I thought if you go and apologize for me. I promised it to Tereza. -So you just won’t show up. The world won’t implode. -But you could go, right? Otherwise Tereza’d go crazy. Since she’s got that new idiot, she’s been crazy. Tereza? Who? Dude, that was some cousin who came to the wedding. -Yea? -Yea! -Oh. Anyways, you’ll go there? -You’ll recognize the girl real easy. -Come here. -She’ll be sitting, staring around. -Yea, great description. -You’ll go? -Fine, I’ll go. Come on. -Thanks. 10:45AM 10:45PM 15 439 CZK BUY God. Yep, that’s me. Rushing again. Again I don’t know what first, and when I finally know what I want, I don’t have time to follow through. Maybe some people never find what they’re looking for because they always make big mistakes. And maybe I’ll always be walking circles around my happiness, never meeting it. I am an error in a system that can’t be fixed because it doesn’t want to be. I want to function freely and sometimes stupidly. This kind of fun will always cost something. Sometimes too much. And sexy as always. Hey. -Hey, what are you doing here? -I had off so I came for a coffee. -Great. -Hey. -Hey. -And you? -Me? I’m waiting for someone. Me too actually. She might already be here. I don’t know what she looks like. -Who is it? -Some girl. -And...? -Yea... It’s a blind date. -It’s some epidemic or something. -What? -Nothing. Nothing. And who are you waiting for? Some new discovery? Hm? Just someone who really annoys me. So, I won’t bother you. I’m sure you’ll knock him off his feet. See ya. -How’s your wife? -Yea, great. The girls are growing like weeds. -Thank you. -You’re welcome. -Shit. -Doesn’t answer? -Hey, I’m not here for any date so you understand properly. -Yea, I get it. -Ok? No, seriously. -Yea, serious as a heart attack. -I’ll kill him. Also no answer? Looks like we’ve been stood up, huh? Nobody ever made me wait except for that idiot. -Listen. -Yea? -Have you spoken to Petr? I did about an hour ago. -What did he want? -Hey, I don’t know. -You don’t know? -It’s quite personal. -What did he tell you? -Hey, I... -What did he tell you? -Alright. That he doesn’t have time. He’s going straight to the airport. That someone’s waiting here for him. -I should find them here and... -That idiot. -Where are you going? -To the airport. -Well, hey, wait. It’s not... Here, ok? -Wait. Wait. -It’s me he was supposed to meet. It’s me. -What? Why didn’t he tell me? -Because he didn’t know. -What the hell are you talking about? -You wouldn’t understand. It’s always fun with you. This is pretty cool. -Don’t say anything. -Yea, I’m quiet. You two are idiots. Wouldn’t it be better to call him once he gets there? -No, you don’t get it. Of course, I don’t get it. -Can’t you go any faster? -How in this traffic? Plus it won’t go any faster. You’re welcome. All the truly important things are in our dreams. We guard them because they’re only ours. I’m back in my other world that I like and couldn’t do without. I’m starting a new story. A beginning, an end. People are always the same, whether they be a cook, manager, assistant, marketing director, footballer, teacher, waitress, bodybuilder, or repo man. We all secretly hope for our own happy ending. We believe that our story will end well because only that makes our life better. It makes sense whatever happens. The story. The beginning. The end.
