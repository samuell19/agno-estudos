40,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age, temperatures climbed and climbed in the Los Angeles basin, giving rise to new species of plants and animals. New predators attacked new prey. But something else rose as the heat swelled. A hot, sticky and seemingly endless seepage from the ground. Tar. As decades passed, the tar pit grew and grew. The animals came but never left. Slowly sucked into the steaming hot tar. Thousands of years later, early Native Americans settled in the area. Villagers nearby used the tar as sealant for canoes, baskets and huts. On one occasion, the villagers were having a celebration, but in the morning, three of the tribesmen who had ventured off were found dead, covered and suffocated by the black substance. After this incident, no one was permitted to go near the pit in the night. They called it Matchi-Manitou, the evil spirit. During the 20th century, a sprawling urban metropolis buried the tar pit deep below its concrete surfaces. Only a small open pit remained, allowing excavators to sift through the trove of ancient skeletons. Many new species were discovered, but one, the elusive Matchi-Manitou, was never found. And the urban metropolis is the street you find yourself standing on right here today. Right here on the streets of Los Angeles. Yo, let's go. Come on. I've just gotta hear it one more time. That's very kind of you, good sir. 40,000 years ago- - You really still believe this shit? I'm not saying that I believe it, but I don't not believe it. Your dad always talks about it. Yeah, my dad would always say, "don't go in the tar pits" as a kid, but you know why? 'Cause it's bad, it's gross, it's sticky. It gets on your foot. You're such a pussy. Here's the deal, we go and finish packing, and then tomorrow we're not gonna be here anymore, so you can come all you want and listen to this story. Come on, let's go. His eyes. I'll never forget that look in his eyes. You know I always wanna help you, Ben, but I can't get you her number. Come on, man! You've known her for years, she trusts you. I love you like a brother but I don't trust you with her. Whatever, man. Oh, hey, hey, hey! - Come here, come here. - What's up? So, I'm sitting here packing, getting everything ready to go, and then something told me "stop everything that you're doing and open the book" and I did, right to this page. "On October 18th, an Aquarius new moon," this is you, "lights up your eighth house of intimacy and shared wealth. This is the second consecutive new moon in Aquarius." The first was on, get this, September 20th. Just like I said! Last week. I am going to miss this so much. I know. Is my dad in? - Dad? - Mm? I need the keys for the workshop downstairs. Please? Isn't the please implied? So it's gonna be one of those days, is it? What makes you think because it's the last day here that it'll be any different than any other day? Okay. Well? All right, let's do it. Through the legs. Again. Come on. You're stubborn, just like your mother. No, I'm stubborn just like you, Dad. Yeah, well, sorry for giving you a livelihood. Yeah, you gave me a livelihood. It just wasn't so lively. Putting computers back together, rebuilding laptops, typewriters every so often. Tell me all about all the offers that you got after getting your degree. Tell me again, enlighten me. Just for once. Sure, yeah, I'll enlighten you that I could use a little encouragement from my father. Is that what this is all about, huh? Is there some sort of resentment? No. Let me tell you something, Zachary. I never resented my dad, who worked his ass off, by the way, giving me all the advantages and privileges that I received. I know. I never, ever resented your mother. Now you're bringing Mom into this? I'll just go get back to packing. None of us knew. Definitely not Ben and Marigold. So? What's next after all this? Fuck if I know. You? I'm gonna open up my own shop. Gonna have candles and cards and stuff in the front and people to do tarot and read palms in the back. You know, you've never done one of those weird handjob things on me. Really? I've given everybody in this office a handjob. Let's see. Oh, wow. It looks like you're in for a really unhappy ending. L. O. L. Come on, this desk isn't gonna move itself. You and your magical psychic mind-reading abilities levitate the desk outta here. Yeah, why didn't I think of that? Dear spirits, help me move the fat ass that's on the desk. Oh. Oh, wow, it's working. Dummy. - Come on. - All right, you ready? One, two. Bobby used to drive me nuts with that tennis ball. Hindsight's a funny gift. Is the 10:30 gonna be on time? If I can set up the track in time. I think you will. Did you bring the pick from the car? - It's on the table. - Oh, all right. I see it. Thank you. 10:27, 10:28, 10:29. 10:30, right on time. Was that an earthquake, Papa? No, no, no. That was the building across the way. Remember I told you? Barry. Do you know that building? That building's gonna be something very special for this city. But I thought it was just a museum? Yeah. To some people, that's special. I think it'd be special if it was a train station. Yeah. Yeah. Barry, Sebastian Sterling's here to see you. Hey, Barry. How are ya? You know it doesn't have to be like this, Barry. This whole thing could end amicably. No. No, Sebastian. With this deadline that you're imposing, no, I don't think the word amicable comes to mind. Right, the whole two-week eviction notice, I mean, that was a tad harsh, and you gotta get out. You know, but according to the terms of the lease- - Yeah, the lease that was written 65 years ago. It's a bit dated, but you know, I've got lawyers, Barry. You know, Sebastian, back then, they didn't need lawyers. You know what it was? It was a handshake. That's it. My card. Take it, use it, call me. If you need me, anything for you, okay? Anything, as long as it's before six a.m. No way. "Science fair champ." Three generations at that place. Greenwood Repair. And Papa and my dad had that bond. I just wish that my dad and I had more of a chance. Oh, hey, bud. Oh, that's, that's sad. It's really sad. Hey, man, I know. I know it's sad, but, you know, I'll be hiring in a year. You're more than welcome to apply. Yeah, I appreciate that. So what do we have to do by six a.m.? What do you have to do by six a.m.? Uh, everything. Everything must go. Everything outta here, okay? The boxes, the schmudtas, the mopey old men. Oh, you mean my dad? Your dad needs to get outta here. The typewriter, gone. The walls, the walls are filthy. Look, there is schmutz all over these walls. They need to be cleaned, carpets need to be shampooed. Paint needs to be repainted, and the bathroom. Can we talk about the bathroom for a second? I need it to smell pristine, and if you don't adhere to all of those things by six a.m. I'm gonna have to refer to the lease. That's where I have to take you to court, then I have to sue you, then you have to pay me the- - $100,000. I know. Yeah, that you know. But it's getting torn down in a month. Why do you care? That's just a rumor. Are you kidding me? That's a fact. - No, that is a rumor. - Ah, no. That's a fact. Don't go start spreading rumors. This building is getting torn down in a month. Hold on, got a call coming in. Hello? Hey, babe. Just going through a tunnel. Listen, hey, it's just procedure, young Greenwald. It's procedure. Oh, yeah, it's procedure you wipe my ass. What was that? Nothin', I was just going over the procedure. I got you covered. You're a good man, Greenwald. It's Greenwood. Greenwood. Hey, did you get my card? This isn't the life I dreamed of. I wanted more adventure in my life. Third year in a row. Sky's the limit. Someday this could be you. Like grandfather, like father, like son. But then one year becomes two and three and four and family obligations and loyalty and then you're stuck. Oh, shit. Help! Somebody? Help me! Somebody! Anybody! Help me! Help me, somebody! I'm still not hungry, Ben. But I have your favorite. What're you doing here? Thought you might be hungry so I brought you some food. It's so good to see you. And look what you did. - Cucumber martini? - No. Yes. You knew exactly what I needed today. Okay, I'll just have one sip. So needed that. Look, I know it's been a rough day for you and your dad. Yeah, what day is it? Come on, Zach, you can't get away with those throwaway "woe is me" lines anymore. Yeah. But you know what, Rose? It's more than that. We never see eye to eye. I'll be up and he'll be down. Or he'll be up and I'll be down. I've been the third wheel in that situation enough times, so trust me, I know. You know what? Tonight, no third wheels, okay? Just two wheels. No third wheels, just... Two wheels. In your next life chapter, you're gonna take center stage. That's what I've been saying. - You get me. - No, I don't get you. The stars get you. They tell me what's going on with you and I relay it. That's it. Hey. Hey. Sorry to bother you guys. Oh, no. You could never be a bother to us. Oh, god, there must've been another accident or something from that subway. Anyway, what's up? Yeah, so, I get a little bit anal with these types of things, and I was wondering if you had any more of that premium quality bubble wrap? Thanks. Really appreciate it. See ya. Can you get any creepier? Did you hear the way she said "anal" to me? - Here you go. - Oh! You didn't have to do that. I could've done that. Oh, it's totally fine. Don't worry about it. I'm almost done packing the back office. I'll make sure that it's packed tightly. - You really are the best. - You really mean that? Of course I do. As soon as we move and I hire new people, I'm bumping you up. Carmenia, I wouldn't be where I am today without you. So, let's get going? Oh, right. Yeah, I'll get right on that. Why isn't it working? Well, I don't know. Let's see. - You got it connected, yeah? - Yeah. Is it tight? Let's see here. There we go. Papa? What? What was that? Just that construction. Really? Doesn't sound like construction. Motherfucking subway! Guess we can't do any more work. Hopefully the power comes back on soon. Or not. Remember, what was that, two weeks ago? It didn't come on for like 45 minutes. What if it doesn't come on again? You know what? Screw it, maybe we should just go. Yeah, so let's all go have a drink, because Zach here's gonna front the 100 grand. Come on, I was just saying, you know, even Sebastian. He probably wouldn't want us to move in the dark. Yes, he will. I'm afraid we have no choice, okay? But someone's gonna get hurt. I don't want Marigold to move in the dark. Or Ben, I don't want him to move in the light. It was my grandfather, it was your great-grandfather, he kinda had to leave Europe in a hurry. He was a stowaway in the belly of a cargo ship. Two weeks on the Atlantic, pitch black. Hey, hey. So now you are afraid to lift a few boxes in the dark, is that right? Is that how I raised you? You're right, but you also didn't raise me with an extra 100 grand to spare, Dad. Really? Is that the way we really want to spend our last night here? Arguing with all this negativity? Let's just turn around, be a little positive, and do what we have to do. And I can help you with whatever you need. I know. Ben. Sorry for talking back, we'll go pack. It's okay. That's my boy. If you're gonna do nothing, at least do it quietly. I hear words, but I'm night-blind, so I can't- - Yeah, huh? Rose never should've turned up at the office that night. Mom got me this. Dad got me this. Wait, I remember the day I got this picture. She wasn't even supposed to be in town. Love you. Biggest mistake of her life. I need to take five. Why? Exhaustion. Really? I'm not gonna sit here and do this by myself. Ah, fuck it. I didn't say anything earlier because you were kinda being a douche when we were moving the desk, but I won two tickets to the zoo in the Ralph's Grocery Store drawing. And I know that you like the meerkats. I love those meerkats. Anyway, they're only valid the first Tuesday of every month. I'm gonna go Tuesday after next. Wait, did you see that? Dude, you're paranoid. You're paranoid! I'm not the one who said I saw anything. Shh! Now you're being defensive and paranoid. It's probably Diana. I think it was over here, yeah? It was you two. I know her shadow. What we saw definitely was not that. Wait, you guys saw something? I saw something but I thought it was you guys. No, we were in our reception area. Maybe it's the girl that works with you, that Carmen girl. Carmenia? No, she's in the back, packing. If it wasn't us and it wasn't you then what the hell was it? Girls, girls. Come here, come here. Listen, I know it's scary. Don't worry, I've got this all under con... That was a drill, right? Yeah, it's like a bulldozer or something, but come hang out in reception with us. Really? What the fuck was that? It felt like the building burped. It was probably just the subway construction. What happened to that light? Dude, relax. You relax! Remember before it was darker? And then now it's flickering and- - When did you become such a crazy drama queen? You're a drama queen! Everyone here needs to calm down! Everybody just calm down. Everything's gonna be okay. Yeah, no. I know. Everything's fine. Everyone's cool, I'm cool. I'm on top of this. No offense, babe, but you don't really seem like the kind of guy who's on top of anything. She has a point. When I look like actually into your soul, I don't see a guy who's on top of things. I just see a giant vagina. That's uncalled for. I can handle this. Wait, can you keep doing that? I mean, if you want. How about when you do something manly, then I'll keep rubbing your back? Okay, how about this? I save your life, you make out with me. I think you have a better shot with the zoo animals. Like oo-oo, ah-ah. Seriously, I think that's a fair exchange. Your life for... Your tongue in my mouth. Statistically speaking, I feel like there's a higher chance of me getting struck by lightning and winning the lottery in the same day, than you actually stepping up to the plate and saving anyone, so... Why not? Shake on it? Shake on it. Has anybody seen Zach? Wait, where is the drink shaker? Nervous? Maybe just a little, with all that's going on. You need a drink. - Better? - Oh, come here. Huh? What? No! Dad! Seriously? My dick. Let's go. Come on, right now. What's going on? I've got everything under control. We just have a little situation. But isn't it the subway or it was- - No, no, no. Listen. I will explain everything in a moment. Right now we just all have to work together. But we are working together. Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. Let's go. Yo, I saw something. I saw a shadow, there is someone or something out there. I don't know what it is. Come on, guys, it's probably just the subway. At this point it doesn't even matter what it was, okay? We all heard what that guy Sebastian said. We've really gotta start moving. I'll tell you exactly what it is about Sebastian. He's a dick. That's all you need to know. It doesn't matter. Rules are still rules. You know what? I hate rules. Yeah, I know. I'm aware. Zach, it's kinda key that you follow a few right now. Why? Because we all have to work together, that's why. No more distractions. We didn't do anything. Now, we're not gonna get anything accomplished, unless we have a plan. Why does it always have to be your plan, Dad? I have a plan, okay? We're gonna take the flashlights that you brought us, we pack and we get outta here. There you go, that's the plan. Thank you. - Zach? - What? Would you just come out in the other room with me? Why? Because I need to tell you something. Everybody else, just chill. We'll be right back. Zach, would you come with me? No. No. Sit down. What now, Dad? What? What? First off, I want you to calm down. Listen, there's something I wanna tell you. I gotta figure this out just in case it's something else. Something else? Yeah, there's just something else I gotta check out, but what I need you to do is I need you to stay in the room and keep everything in order, okay? Can you do that for me? Can you do that for your mother? I've been doing this for Mom for 10 years, Dad. Ever since the day she... Do you, listen, do you remember... It was a little league semi-final game, and you were really frustrated with me. The game where you were mouthing off and the ump almost kicked you out of the game? Yeah. Yeah, I was, but you're my son. - You won the game. - Yeah. - You went to the finals. - Yeah. Once again, you're upset. You don't wanna play. But you pulled it together. You said "I'm gonna do this for the team." Right? You. You did for the team. Yeah. So you come out the dugout, you had confidence, man. You step into the box and you dig in. First pitch. Boom! - It was a great moment. - Great moment. This is another one of those moments. Now I really need you to stay here. Don't let anybody leave, can you do that? Okay. Yeah, that a boy. Yeah. Thought I'd never see him again. Just like with Mom. Miss D? Miss Diana? What the... I got it. You got the tape? Get in here. Come here, Barry. Nobody's here. I want you to stay right here, okay? I'm coming back. Okay? Stay here, you hear me? Keep it closed. Everything's fine. I'll be right back. Shit! Damn it! I will not let fear control me. I will not let fear control me. I should really go check on Carmenia. Wait. No, Diana. Diana, stop. You gotta stay here. Why? I told my dad that I'd make sure everyone stayed here. So everyone stays here, nobody goes anywhere. Okay, I get it and I respect your dad, but he also said when he left that he'd be right back and it's, it's been more than half an hour. - I know, I know, I know. - I think everybody's fine. I think they're both fine. Oh, my god. Okay, I gotta go have a look. I'll be right back. Really? It was probably just the subway. That's one fucked up subway. My dad always had all the answers. But now he had no answers. None. Dad? You okay, Dad? What the... What the hell? Dad? Dad, where are you? Shit! Hello. So, how long have you and Zach been together? Um, three years and three months to the day, actually. Happy anniversary. Thank you. Boom! War! Yes! What about you? Do you have a guy? I'm married to my work. You don't think that there's like a Mr. Right out there for you? You see these? It's kinda hard not to. They're a blessing and a curse at the same time. Sometimes I feel like they can stop people from seeing the real me. Boom! War! - Deal it. - You deal it. Fuck. Oh, shit! He's not answering. Don't worry, Rose. He's probably just dropping a deuce. Doesn't want you to know about it. That's disgusting. So? Why are you doing all this? - Doing what? - This! There's black tarry stuff on the ground, you've been making all those noises, the power's out. Why are you doing all this, huh? Oh, no, boy. I wish it was me doing it, but it ain't. No, no. It most definitely ain't. Well, if it ain't you, then why are you here? Well, the sidewalk gets cold. Man's gotta stay warm at night. Wait, these are mine. I looked for these for two weeks a year ago. And a most enjoyable year it was. Much appreciated. Oh, you want me to fluff your pillow too? Yeah. What is all this shit anyway? You see this? This is the truth. This is what's going on out there. I always thought Papa's bedtime stories were just that. Just stories. But... There's clues. 'Cause he'd always say that in every story there's a kernel of truth. Shh. You're mad. You know that, right? Well, you can call me what you will, but I've seen it. Seen what? I'm gonna call 911. Yeah, I know, it's a good idea. Oh, shit. My phone just died. Does anybody have a phone? We need to call the cops. Yeah, I think mine's in my office. Do you wanna come with me to get it? - Yes. - Okay. No! You guys, I thought we agreed that we were just gonna stay here? Okay, well, do you have a phone? Me and modern technology don't really mix, you know? Ladies. Especially Diana. This is for you. I was just like you, 30 years ago. You're nothing like me. What're you talking about? I was just a young assistant archeologist with my brother down there at the tar pits of La Brea. But then I saw things. Things that people don't wanna see. When it was disturbed under the ground, it would come up. And what comes up? Man of the tar. This works almost every time. Oh, my god! What's the matter with you? I was going places, boy. I'm not crazy like you think. Sometimes things ain't what they seem. Down there at the tar pits of La Brea. I told them the truth. I did! But sometimes people don't wanna hear the truth. So they gave me a label. They called me schizophrenic. Whoa, whoa. No, they didn't believe me. The deaths of all those people 30 years ago. Ever since then, I had to be a man of the street. A man of this great office. Could I just ask you one thing? Have you seen my dad? You're Barry Greenwood's boy? But you're such a pussy. So you tap that button as fast as you can and as hard as you can and I'll hold the top button really really hard while I drag my knuckles across the screen. Right, go. Just breathe. Breathe. He just always does this, it drives me crazy. What's your name anyway? After all these years, boy, you finally wanna know my name? The name's Carl. O'Neil. The third. But folks round here just call me Carl. Carl. Okay, remember before, I was talking about my dad? Have you seen him? I thought I saw him back there for a brief little moment. You did? Okay. Here's what we have to do. We gotta work together to beat the man of the tar and find Mr. Barry Greenwood. Okay. Whatever it takes, I'll buy it. What do we do? When noise disturbs the world where the creature of the tar rests, he becomes uneasy. And when man builds down, he disrupts the world where he lives. And his only recourse is to stop that disruption, and he used his world to destroy. You see, he's friends with the tar. Friends with the tar? How are you friends with tar? And every time he's disturbed, his unrest becomes greater. Okay, let's say I believe you. Oh, believe. - So, what do we do? - It's light. It's his eyes, young Greenwood, he can't have the light. See, his eyes are his worst enemy. At least the one he has left. He only has one eye? Light and silence. Light and silence? That's the answer. Okay. So what do we do? Well, I... I'm gonna go find Zach. Wait, Rose. Silence, young Greenwood. Zach? If you can hear me, say something back. - Zach, where are you? - Shut the... Shh, shh, shh. Zach? Zach, please say something. Zach? Zach, you need to answer me. Zach, stop being stubborn for once in your life and... The power's gonna come back on soon. That bad premonition that I have? It's gone. Certainly somebody's gotta call the cops, right? This is the only time ever I want the cops to come. I'm not just saying this because of the cards, I truly think that everything's gonna be all right. Quiet. Right, it's gone, it's gone. Wait, wait, wait. Let's go. Shh, shh, shh. Are you okay? Are you okay? Think it's finally toast. We are so sorry for your loss. Rest in peace, phone. You were so good to me. You've been so good to me you make me wanna shout? Kick my heels up and shout? Throw my hands up and shout. No. Don't forget to say you will. Don't forget to say. ♪ Say you will ♪ ♪ Say you will now, baby ♪ ♪ Don't forget to say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Say you will ♪ ♪ Little bit louder now, a little bit louder now ♪ ♪ A little bit louder now, a little bit louder now ♪ ♪ A little bit louder now, a little bit louder now ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Say that you love me ♪ ♪ Say that you need me ♪ ♪ Say that you want me ♪ ♪ You wanna please me ♪ ♪ Hey, hey ♪ What the fuck is going on? Shh, Rose, you've gotta be quiet. I am really not into being shushed from you right now. I'm sorry, okay? It's just that there's... What? Can we talk about this later? Why can't you just tell me? You're a lot more like your dad than you think. Oh, come on. No. God, just stay here. What is out there? Okay, there's a really, really bad guy out there. Please just stay here, let me finish this. Come on, Rose, trust me. Okay? Okay. Stop! The hell is your problem? I'm sorry. God, I just feel like we've been in here for way too long. Completely agreed. I should really go check on Carmenia. Yeah, I'll go with you for protection. No, are you guys insane? No, neither of you are going anywhere. You just stay here... That's really bad energy. Get up! That is not a subway! Just remember. - Just stay here. - Just stay here. It's gone. I think we're alone, you guys. Marigold, it's not the time for this shit. Shut up. Marigold, seriously. What are you doing? - What're you doing? - I feel that... That was the end of it. No, are you out of your mind? Sit down! Voices! I think he's right that we should just sit down and wait for help to come. I know I said we should wait, but if it's gone, we need to make a run for it. No, wait. Stop doing that. Are you nuts? Stop doing that! Stop it. What're you doing? I just gotta look. I just know we're gonna be okay. You guys. I think it's gone. Oh, my god! Oh, shit! Come on, work. Damn it! Work, work, work. Come on. Zach! Oh, my god. It's Zach, Ben! Diana, come on, we have to go. Did you see that thing? Diana, where's Marigold? Everybody's gone. Marigold, dead. Everybody's gone. Marigold. I can't believe I just killed that thing. Diana, come on. No, wait! Wait. Didn't I just save your life? Yes, kind of, okay? But let's talk about that later. No, no, no. Now, now. Ben, I don't care what you did, we just have to- - This has nothing to do with you! We had a deal, a saved life equals a kiss! Don't. We shook on it! I'm sick of being walked all over by you guys all the time! I finally did something meaningful with my life and I just wanted to be acknowledged, okay? It doesn't matter who saved anyone's life. We just have to get out of here! I'm trying! Come on! This has nothing to do with you, shut up! It's dead, what's the rush? I killed it, okay? Ben! Ben! Ben! Come on, Diana, grab my hand! Oh, my god. Run, Diana! - Zach! - Reach, reach! - Reach for my hand. - Zach, help me. Come on. No. God damn it! Shh, shh. Rose! - Who is that? - Barry? Oh, Rose. Oh, my god! Rose, hold me. - What happened? - No, no, no. Look at me. Are you okay? - Yes, are you okay? - Listen. No, no, no. Listen to me, listen to me. You've gotta be quiet. That's what Zach said too. Rose, is Zach okay? No. Barry, stay awake, okay? You gotta stay awake, you just... Oh, god. Tell me a story, okay? Barry? Keep talking, okay? Tell me a story. I thought I was prepared for this, but... Prepared for what? Shit, I gotta go. Where's my dad? My dad, that look on his face. I'll never forget that look on his face. I was looking for my dad. And that sound. My god, there was a sound. A sound like you've never heard. I was scared. I ran and I hid. I was so afraid. Papa! Okay, come here. Something more dangerous, and more terrible than anything. Anything you can possibly imagine. Listen. Listen, you hear that? Dad? Dad, are you down here? Rose? Dad? Dad, are you here? What the... What the fuck? Okay, grab the corner of that carpet and just- - Right here? - Yeah, just pull it back. Pull it up. That a girl. Okay, lay it down first. That's it. Get behind. Get behind but be quiet. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Shh. Don't move. Don't move. - Zach! - Rose? Rose! Dad? Dad! Calm down. Why did you think you could do this on your own, Dad? - Listen to me. - What? This is important, we gotta work fast. I need you to do something for me. This one of your plans? Okay, okay. I need you to open that box. Okay. - Come on, quietly, quietly. - Okay, okay. Okay, open it. What is this stuff? See that handle? Slide it out of the sheath. You know, Zach, sometimes it takes something like this just to realize that all the battles that we fought just weren't worth fighting. You're right. But this is. You're gonna have to do this. Can you do this? Yeah. Hey, Zach. What is that thing? You got it? Shit. You got it? That a girl. Got it, got it? Okay. Shit! Oh, no! The electricity is not working! Get at it. Got it? Sit down. It's gonna be okay. You know what that smells like? Smells like $100,000. Hello! One hour till everybody's gotta the hell outta here! Actually, 54 minutes! 54 minutes! Shh! Don't shush me! I can make as much noise as I want. This is my building! I can make as much noise as I want! Sebastian! Shut the fuck up. Will you stop shushing me? Don't you understand that there is a Kentucky Fried Chicken that is gonna be directly below where we're standing very soon? That is exciting. You've got to be quiet! You don't understand. I'm so excited right now, I could dance! Shut up, you've got to be quiet. Shut the fuck up! Whoa. Hey. Relax, man. Okay? There's, there's, don't get crazy, okay? You, you, you can have another 10 minutes. You've gotta be quiet. You don't understand what's out there. Out where? Here. Here? Oh, shit. Go, go. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. He'll go away. He's gone, he's gone. I've got this. I've got this. Light and silence. That's the answer. What the fuck? It was you. Fucking asshole. He's gone. I'm so scared. Come on, come on. Shit. No! Go back, go back! Dad! Dad, grab this! Below you, grab it! I got it! What is this thing? - Turn it on! - What do I do? Push the red button, Dad! I've got it! Point it in his eyes! Don't fuck with my family. I don't hear him. - Oh, Zach. - Zach. Let's go. Let's go. Dad. Family. You did it. Dad. "Don't fuck with my family." You actually said "don't fuck with my family?" Yeah, I actually said that. I mean, that's... And then you shined a light on this thing? Some sort of super light? I don't know if I'd call it a super light. It was really bright and I was surprised as you it worked. It actually worked. And the monster was eight feet tall? Or nine, ten? I don't know, it was huge. Tall monster. Remember I told you it had the tusk? - The tusk? - The tusks! The tusk. Right, the tusk. Okay? Because this is the truth. This is what's going on down there. I'm not crazy like you think. Whoa. Hey. We did not use the word crazy. Well, the dad needs medical and then I think that we can let him and the girl in holding go. Yep and we can put out an APB for a tall homeless guy with a thing for tar. All right. Let's go, Dad. And Dad, I don't think it's over. Yeah. We'd have to do this all on our own. Like Papa. We have to find the creature and we need to go under the pit. I'm not sure. It's the only way. Dad, it will be back. No. They will. Story of the man of the tar. Some say he still lives in the tar. Under the streets that were once filled with the hustle and bustle of trollies. The man of the tar not long ago attacked a family. So many died. I should know. My brother was one of them. As for the fate of Matchi-Manitou, the creature of the tar, no one knows. He may be gone, or he may be waiting. Waiting to be awoken. Awoken once again. Awoken by the streets you find yourself standing on right here, today. The streets of Los Angeles.
