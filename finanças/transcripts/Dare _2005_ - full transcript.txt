[school bell] You coming, light boy? - Come to think of it... maybe you wouldn't be so bad to interfere with? - Stay back! Don't you come toward me another step, Stanley, or I'll? What? Some awful thing will happen. It will. What are you putting on now? I warn you, don't! I'm in danger. Uhh... Stella? That's the third time tonight, Johnny! We open next week! Sorry, I got distracted. Yeah! So did I. If you don't have these lines down by tomorrow, I'm going to give it to someone else. We're done! Good night! Get out of here. Well, that sucked! YOU were good. Call me later, Ben. Alexa! Can I get a ride home? No! I'm running late because of you. If you make me look bad, Johnny, I swear to God? Learn your goddamn lines! What? You're going to make me take the bus? [to himself] Bitch! Hey! Do you want a ride? I could help you with your lines. Okay. It's this way. Hold on a sec. This stuff's really expensive. Yeah, there's a whole case of that shit in there. Drop the bottle. Drop it. We've have this date with each other from the beginning. What? That's the line I forgot. [champagne cork pops] It'll help with your lines. I've been on to you from the start. Not once did you... "pull any wool over this boy's eyes." Oh, fuck! Fuck this! Jump in! No, it's okay. Oh-o-o... shy light boy! That's okay. You could stay in the shallow end. Do you want a cigarette? No thanks. Didn't think so. Where's a bathroom? Piss over there. Problem? Hey, make sure you get the statue. It's my step-mom's favourite. [snickers] Nice! I can't believe that's your first cigarette. I'm totally corrupting you. It's.. kinda cool. All I need is a bong hit and a blow job, and I'd be perfect. Why don't you call Alexa? Alexa wouldn't hook up with you. How do YOU know? She's my friend. Yeah, your only one. Why is she friends with you, anyway? I've known her since I was little. Have you ever even hooked up with anyone from school? It's just... I hear you're all talk. From who? Nobody talks to you. Just because I don't want to date any of those skanky rich girls, man. Maybe I'm just sensitive. [Ben laughs sarcastically] Fuck you. You don't know me. Well you don't know me either. Have you ever even gotten a blow job? Have you? I asked first! I bet you haven't. You can blow me, light boy. You don't know what you're talking about. Whip it out. I'm not a fag, man. Whatever. I'm not the sensitive one. When did you turn into "evil light boy"? When you turned out to be a total poser. Dude, who the hell are you? You gonna do it or not? You really want it, don't you? Well, maybe you want it and you're just too scared to admit it. I'm not scared. So? I don't want anything. I've never kissed anyone before. I'm about to... about to graduate high school and I've never kissed one person. Are you serious? Look man... You tell anybody this and I'll kick your ass. I've never gotten a blow job. Awww... Never been kissed? [chuckle] Come here! How's that? What are you doing? I don't know. [kiss] [kiss] Dude, wait... wait. [More kisses. Johnny gasps.] [kissing/sucking sounds continue...] [distant conversation] [indistinct conversation] - Hey. - Hey. Just learn your lines, okay? Yeah, okay. What's he doing here? Uh... Mrs. Davis... made him come and help me with my lines. - Gee, that sucks. Hey. Is your nose bleeding? Oh... Yeah... I bumped it on the ledge. Are you okay? Lex, we're running fast. Yeah, coming. You don't want to stay, do you? No, it's okay. [laughs]
