YAKUZA DEKA: MARIJUANA TRAFFICKING SYNDICATE Produced by Koji Ohta Screenplay by Fumio Konami & Yukio Noda Music by Masao Yagi Starring Shinichi Chiba Ryohei Uchida Fumio Watanabe Giant Baba Directed by Yukio Noda Around here? Thanks. By the way, your driving is amazing. You've got guts. You're quite a guy! It was a cinch. I'm talented in many ways. Gambling, women, shooting, et cetera, et cetera... What is "et something"? You fool! By the way, did you save me because I'm Ishiguro from Seiwa? What? You're the famous Ishiguro? Sorry, I didn't know. I took your side just because I detest cops. Hippies and bow-legged girls are not to my liking, though. No good? But you are exceptional. Hey, guys. How about having your fortune told? The lines of your palm, features, or... Let's do it just for fun. Okay. You may go. Welcome. I'm not doing this for money, understand? - Your date of birth? - 5th February, 1935. 5th February, 1935... You were born under an unlucky star. Let me read your palm. - No good. - What's dead? Not dead. No good. I help you now. Mouse... Cow... Cow... Monkey. That should do. Let me have a look again. It was haunted by the God of Death. But I had it peter out just now. Oh, that sounds right. Doesn't it? One more time. Can you tell anything else? I'm not doing this for money... but thanks. Show me your face. It's great. Your countenance shows excellent luck. You have luck with money. Gamble tonight and you'll win a lot. Good, eh? If you are so lucky, will you have a match with me? Quiet. Oh, you, too! It's so rare to have two lucky people together. I don't need you to tell me that. Great. I'll hit the jackpot to repay you for what you did earlier. That sounds good. Have you got any money? Don't underestimate me. Come with me. Thanks, pop. I'll treat you to a bowl of ramen with my winnings. Ramen? Stingy. Get me something else. CLUB QUEEN BEE She's a peach. What are you watching? We should get down to business. Stop it! If you abuse Japanese women, you have to face me. - The strongest Japanese I've seen! - Yes. Ouch. Ouch! - You're tough, too. - Not at all. Let's go. Thanks. Hey... I'm broke. I was to repay you, but the luck went the other way. I'm sorry, but that's gambling. I'll buy you a bowl of ramen anyway. I told you, I'm broke. Lend me some. Give up. Oh, boss! Oh, are you Boss Mano? Great timing. May I ask you for a loan? No way. I can't lend money to a vagabond like you with no collateral. I have plenty of collateral. Don't move! This vest is part of my collateral. Put it on. Shit. Damn it! Boss... After them! You, too! Go! Go that way. Did anybody pass by here? - Anything wrong? - I saw men go over there. Thanks. - What's going on? - I wonder. Did you find them? There are lots of troublemakers. That's right, boys! - Good luck. - Thanks. Did you find them? I owe you my life again. Boss. Here's a million yen. I'll buy your bulletproof vest, to show my thanks. Thanks a lot. But actually... why don't you buy my skills instead? I don't know what's going on. But I know they aren't ordinary yakuza They're professional assassins. No one is a match for them... ...except me. You're an exception too, pal. I see. Your name is Hayata, right? You want to sell your skills... So you want to work for me. Yes. I'm fed up with loafing around. And I happened to know Ishiguro, your right-hand man. Alright. We won't go through any complex ceremony. You'll be under the care of Ishiguro. Thanks. Take this money in the meantime. See you later. I think those guys were... No doubt. They're Natsui's men. They've begun to make a move. They intend to kill me to begin with, then eliminate the big men behind the scenes... ...in order to get their hands on our smuggling ring. Something has to be done before it's too late. That's right. I've got a job for you, Ishiguro. I know. You want me to kill Natsui, don't you? They're trying to kill us. We have to stay ahead of them. That is... These three are drug control officials who were killed in the last couple of weeks. They were moles in Natsui's organization. Chief, how much do we know about the Natsui Gang? This is Natsui. We still don't know much about his organization. One of the dead officials reported that Natsui's real intention is to take over the Seiwa Gang. Take over their marijuana smuggling network around the Tokyo area. I see. And... oh, where has he gone? That's why they're attacking Seiwa. That shows that the Natsui Gang are ready to import a lot of marijuana. It must be different from their usual route, Korea or South Eastern Asia. Their way of killing is far more brutal than the old yakuza in Japan. It's more Western professional style. They're too much for drug control officials. I see. Western style... It means like the famous one in Chicago... Al Capone's 'Maffifa' or something. You mean Mafia? Your pronunciation is improving. We are facing the newest and biggest marijuana network in Japan. We have to completely destroy it. This is our special mission. Is that clear? Hayata. You're the only one who can do it. Will you do the job? Your name will be wiped from the police list. You'll be placed beyond our control. We can't guarantee your safety, either. I understand. Here's the secret weapon. It will be of some service to you. Mineo will be supporting you as before. Let Natsui recognize your skills, and gain his favour. She's a cutie. She's the only sister of Wakabayashi, the officer who was killed. Cheer her up, but don't tell her who you are. Yes, sir. She's a teacher in an orphanage. Who's next? Be good, children. Okay? Yes, miss! Take care of the children, pal. You can't leave me here alone. Wait! Hurry... Here we are, pal. You didn't make a pass at her in the forest, did you? - You seem to have a liking for her. - What do you mean? Nothing, only... She's beyond our reach. Too good for scoundrels like us. You're good with smart phrases. Of course. Back me up, pal. Hey, Hayata... Shit... Wait! You are...? What happened? Hey! Who attacked you? Who's your boss? Who ordered you to do this? About the boss... Tomorrow, at 10am, he'll leave the Natsui building, pass the Otome Pass... ...and go to the golf course. Are you alright? He was the bass player... Shit. The band belonged to Natsui! What, Natsui? It's Natsui... Is there any sign of Seiwa making a move? Not so far. We've brought in a lot of support. Strike Seiwa dead. His car windows are bulletproof. We can't do anything unless he comes out. They're coming. Good. He's coming out. - You've done it. - Good. This way. Shit. You missed him. Don't panic. I'll kill him next time. Bastard! Hey! They are there! - Let's go that way. - It's dangerous here. - Jump down! - I don't like... - Wait! - Hurry up! Get on. Hurry. Shit, it's burning up. Hot! It's too hot! What can we do? The river! Damn. We were beaten. Badly beaten. Badly. Bastards. We'll get them next time. Something's wrong with my ass. Ouch! You, too. - We're even. - From now on. Let's cool down. A rat named Hayata... He stands in our way, working for Seiwa. Hayami missed him. That drunken assassin couldn't get him, either. He's really tough. But he's a vagabond, in the end. Money can buy him. Get him to double-cross? Lure him out first. Ayako... that's your job. Lure him with your body. Then make him smell money. I remember you well. I'm honored. Do you remember me? Of course I do. - You haven't been dancing lately? - I'm not very popular now. There's more important things... I want to tempt you tonight. I feel the same way. That will save us a lot of trouble. You have something to tell me. You must know what. Shall I say it? You're with me because Natsui ordered you to be. But you don't seem to want to kill me. What's your objective? Don't you want money? Of course I do. Why not quit that worthless Seiwa Gang and double-cross them? That depends... This is just a portion. Not bad, eh? What do you think? I once aimed for Natsui and injured him. That's the point. Think up some proposition to make up for that. For instance, destroy the Seiwa Gang. Alright, I'll try. Why don't you go home? Your mission is over. It's been more pleasant than I'd thought. I'd like to keep working on a job like this. Hold me tight. - I understand. - I'm counting on you. Your life line crosses the Yamanote. I won't take that train tonight. See you. Good evening! Bring him a double whisky! Captain, no. I'm an American Colonel, mind you. No difference! I've just returned from Vietnam. Vietnam, the war front. Returned from Vietnam? Come back to Japan. Sounding the advance... You are patriotic, girls. Are you a hostess? A call girl? I own this bar, I'm a 'mama-san'. Oh, Mama-san, you're beautiful, madam. Oh, I remember, your name is "Kintaro"! I'm not Kintaro, from the folk tale. Oh, Kumako, I see, I see. "Kumako in a tenement"? Not that kind, like in the comedy sketch. Kumako is a cute girl's name, like Hanako, or Yoshiko. Some more, madam. - It's real Scotch. - More, please. That's enough. Bottom's up. Cheers. Thanks, Colonel. Come, everyone! Oh, Hayata. Thank you for the other day. Everyone! - Thank Mr Hayata. - Good. Sorry, I didn't thank you till now. I didn't know your address... I was afraid you wouldn't come again. This is Ishiguro's number. Tell him to come over now. Why so suddenly? Don't ask me why, please. It concerns his life. His life? Keep him here all day. By any means. Certainly. We're having a birthday party. - I'll invite him to that. - Thank you. Mister! 340,000 yen. - 340,000 yen? - Yes, 340,000 yen. 34 times 10,000 notes. I have some money. This is all I have now. Here are some pawn tickets and officers' food tickets. Really? - That's all I've got. - It's not a joke. - I have other things. - I've sobered up. I have plenty of marijuana. You have? Show it to me. Not here. In the other room. Madam, music, please. Okay, I understand. Where is it? - Oh, marijuana! - Yeah, marijuana. Look. One bag, two bags... Three, on top of that. $2,000. - That's the market price. - To hell with the market price. Money, quick. Hey, Little Joe. Test him. "Bus"? What does he say... Oh, yes, cabaret, snack bar, night club, motel... - Mama-san... okay? - Speak. He doesn't speak English at all. Who are you? Well, er... You're Japanese? - Help me, madam. - Help? Damn you, with your wig! You are a detective? - Damn you! - Madam! Don't call me Madam. You have thin hair under your wig. So you're Toru, the smuggler? If you know that much... I'll skin your head for you. Ouch, ouch... What is that... It's him. He's a detective, no doubt. Mr Detective, are you ready? When Mano appears here, they'll put guards at the entrance, emergency staircase and the escalator. You go to the entrance. You, the staircase. And you by the escalator. You will climb up the back wall and get the guys on the roof. All in three minutes. After three minutes, I'll get into Mano's exclusive lift. I'll switch off the emergency alarm. We've only got five minutes to do all this. Then it's another shift of watchmen. Any questions? Excuse me. Do you have light? Who are you? Where are you going? The boss's lift is moving. Own up! Spit it out! Who are you? Hayata. What do you want? Mr Mano. You're a dead man. You're late. Mr Mineo. Here's your reward. So much? I'll come again, then. Thank you. What's this? You double-crosser! You're caught in a trap, boy. Be punctual, you fake Charles Bronson. You're Natsui's men. You trapped me, eh? I leave them to you. All the big shots from the Seiwa Gang! Thanks for gathering, gentlemen. Congratulations! Blow out the candles. Congratulations! Congratulations! Come, come and eat. Brother! We were attacked and the boss is... Sorry, I have to go. Quick. Boss! It's Natsui. Damn Hayata double-crossed us. What? Hayata? Shit. I'm sorry, boss. I'll avenge this for you. What's this? I'm sorry, but you're through. What? The boss ordered us to get rid of the rubbish. You tricked me, eh? I've met you before. That's right. I failed to hit you that time, but... ...not this time. Stand back, men. Stay back. How have you been, gentlemen? I'm Hayata and I've been... You guys don't have any manners. Shut up! Stop your monkey show. You tried to get on our good side by double-crossing Mano. But I won't accept a traitor who tried to kill me. Oh... The situation is getting very unfavorable. She might have told you differently. But a rat like you would double-cross again. What's the big idea? You'll die as a rat. Have you gone nuts, you flunky cop? Sudo. Would you double-cross me, too? Boss... This guy's a rat, but... he's a man of amazing skill. It's a shame to kill him? He'll be of use, if properly trained. Can you take that on? Alright, I'll save your face today. But you'll pay with your life if you bungle it again. It's too noisy. We are not attacking the US air base, are we? You talk too much. You'll be in trouble. CENTRAL AMERICAN LEAGUE - EMBASSY That's Juzo Kondo, the chief secretary of the Democratic Party. Mind your own business. What's wrong? Are you okay? This ex-cop won't live long. - He's got stomach cancer. - What? He can't have women, alcohol... His days are numbered. Son of a bitch... Bastard, I'll kill you. Hey. Sorry, I'm alright. Leave me alone. You must work through the Natsui network from now on. Understand? Listen! You can't deal marijuana outside the Natsui network. - What's with you? - I'll do it to you, slut! - Have you got money? - Mr Ishiguro! Oh, Miss Saori! Watch out, come this way. Well... How's Hayata doing? I don't know. He's not a friend of mine anymore. You hate him, don't you? To tell you the truth, I invited you to the party that day for a reason. Hayata had asked me to invite you. It was a matter of life and death, he said. He did? I learned later that your friends were killed. If you were with them, you could have been dead. Hayata must have known and saved you. Hayata saved me... Did he? But why? It's you. I was dying to see you. This is my castle. Even Natsui can't get in here. It's all my own. But... you're an exception. Is this a marijuana party? Mexico... The drug of heaven... It comes from Mexico... Plenty, from Mexico... Mexico. The tobacco of heaven... Mexico? CENTRAL AMERICAN LEAGUE - EMBASSY The boat carrying the marijuana is nearing Japan. Are you fully prepared for it? Let the boat enter the gulf here. Okay, we'll tell them to do so. Are you sure it's safe? Don't worry. The syndicate has made all the arrangements. 2kg of LSD and hashish please The time and place for the deal will be confirmed later Shit. Damn. Ouch, ouch. Bastards. You worthless drunkard! You didn't see through that guy. Now we're in danger. Stand up! You bastard! You tricked us. I'll kill you. Sudo! You said you'd take responsibility for this guy. But how? Kill him. Make him spit it out first. He double-crossed us! You killed three officials. Why do you save me? You made me want to atone for my sins in the end. That's all. Are you alright? Give it to me. Listen! A big transaction will take place on the 17th at 2pm at Kondo's villa. What? It's this Mexican deal. Kondo is involved. Catch them red-handed. I understand. I once won a Metro Police shooting contest. Look out! Beat it! Run! Watch this. This is the end of the drunken cop! Damn. The villa is too closely guarded. I see it now. You're a detective. I won't make any excuses. I was a fool. You saved me by way of an apology? Maybe because you're a lone wolf like me. Flattery won't stop me from killing you, Detective! Draw your gun. You're as short-tempered as ever. Shoot me, if you can. Hey, why are you so interested in that boat? Is Natsui involved? It's carrying marijuana from Mexico. Alright. I'll let you carry out your duty. You played dirty, but this is my payback to you for saving my life. But remember. This will be your last job. "Fight evil with evil." Let the depraved ones sink to their worst. Only the good ones will thrive and reconstruct Japan. Drink to our future. Bottoms up! Hey. - What's happening? - After them! Fire! - Boss? - Fire! Damn it! Charge! Let's go! Once more! Take that! Go! Don't move! Hands up! Watch out! Hey! It seems like I've gone too far with you. I'm sorry. I wanted to dance again... just for you. Take this, you bastards. Here's more. - Ugh! - Nezuko, stop here. Hey, Hayata! Ishiguro! I'm still alive. You can't die before having a match with me. - Hello! - Nezuko! Thanks. - Look out! - I'll get the small fry. Erika, Ranko! Get rid of him. Get out of my way, women! You are the assassins? Damn. Die, devils! Ishiguro! Nezuko! Damn you... Ishiguro! You can't die before me, you fool! I'm still alive, you idiot. I regret that I didn't kill you. Say hello to Miss Saori. Shit. Hurry up! Keep swimming there. I'll fish you up. Bastard! Watch out! Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye! Good luck! Grow big, children. Goodbye! Why do I always have to be a clown at the end, in these stupid clothes? Everyone's saying goodbye. Oh yes? Goodbye, goodbye! Hey! Where are you going? Wait! Wait, Hayata! What are you doing? What should I do?
