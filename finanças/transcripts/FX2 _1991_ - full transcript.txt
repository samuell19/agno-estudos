THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I FOUND OUT WHY MIKE WAS KILLED. ALL RIGHT, HERE. SAINT PETER'S IN ROME. THE VATICAN. OKAY? THE SISTINE CHAPEL. THESE BRONZE-COLORED RELIEFS SHOW SCENES... FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT BOOK OF KINGS. FROM HERE TO HERE, THE GRADUAL CONVERSION OF THE HUMAN SOUL TO GOD. WHEN HE FINISHED THE SISTINE CHAPEL, MICHELANGELO RE-CREATES THESE RELIEFS... IN SOLID GOLD. TEN MEDALLIONS ABOUT SO BIG. THIS IS THE CASE THAT MIKE WAS WORKING ON. ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, THESE MEDALLIONS WERE PART OF THE VATICAN EXHIBIT AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM. A GUY NAMED CARL BECKER, PRETTY GOOD THIEF, HE SNEAKS IN AND HE GRABS 'EM. DUMB SON OF A BITCH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA DO WITH 'EM. BECKER GETS PINCHED THE VERY NEXT DAY, BUT THE MEDALLIONS, THEY NEVER TURN UP. NOW, THESE ARE ORIGINAL, HAND-MINTED, SOLID GOLD MICHELANGELOS.
