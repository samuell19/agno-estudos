Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM Hey, dad, you ready to out-do last Fourth of July? Sorry, but I can't divulge my secrets. I'm going to have to keep you in suspense a little bit longer. Not fair! Well, I can tell you this. In a little while, I'm going to light up that sky, big time. You think he can make it happen, mom? I have total faith in your father, but then, I am married to him. You left out "blissfully". I love helping you guys. Well, you've been doing it since you were three. Yeah, I know. You owe me a lot of back pay. Talk to the financial officer. Check's in the mail, sweetie. Looks like Sammie is summoning me. Can you guys spare me? I think we can handle it from here. Okay, love you. Have a great show. Have fun, kiddo. Hey. Surprise! Our tradition. Big moments call for cupcakes. You are rocking the outfit, by the way. Look at your nails! Thank you. I may have outdone myself. Ebay? How dare you. I searched every thrift store between here and Seattle for this ensemble. Well, you look even more patriotic than last year. Well, I wish I could say the same for you. Why, thank you. There. See? That's much better. Now I feel like singing the star-spangled banner. Here. So good. This is my definition of nirvana. I'm going to miss you so much. Didn't I tell you? I'm coming with you. I wish. How did your folks take it? I didn't tell them yet. Amy... Tomorrow. What about Hank? Tonight. Yikes. You are so brave. I want to be just like you when I grow up. I am not feeling very grown up at the moment. Amy... I want to say something. Really? Because I wanted to tell you something, too. Do you want to go first or should I? It's okay, you can ago first. You remember how "The Seattle Observer" offered me that internship? Yeah, you couldn't have planned it more perfectly. You'll only be, like, a few miles away from my law school. I know, but plans have changed just slightly. They have? The craziest thing happened. "The Chicago Post" offered me a job. Not an internship, a real job. That's great. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm... I'm excited. I just thought... You wanted to stay here... With me. I did, of course, I did. This just came out of nowhere, and I... I couldn't say no, because I might not get a chance like this again. I mean, Hank, it's Chicago... It's my dream job. What about us? We're still us. Okay. How though? I mean, you won't even live here. Look, I know it's not ideal, but we'll just figure it out as we go along, right? Right. Okay, what did you want to tell me? Nothing... nothing. Are you sure? Yes. Totally. Nothing. The fireworks are starting. Listen up, people. Circulation's down. We're not connecting enough with our readers. We need more human interest, something meaty. Larry, what have you got? Top ten taco stands in Chicago? You said you wanted something meaty. Funny, Larry. Wendy? I need a minute to regroup. Help me out here, Amy? What if we do a profile of everyday people we come in contact with, the folks that we take for granted. The bus driver, the waitress at the diner, the dry cleaner. You know, get to know them, find out their dreams, their... Their daily battles. No good? Snooze fest. Do you want it bigger? Yeah, give me something explosive. I'll circle back to you. How's it coming? Well, the Fourth of July's coming up. What about we do a behind-the-scenes look into the fireworks industry? I didn't mean literally explosive. No, really. There's a lot that goes into putting on a big show. Launching a firework is like launching a cannonball out of a cannon. The shells can be huge, sometimes three feet in diameter. I could interview some pyrotechnicians... That's actually not bad. Talk to the wildest, hardcore guys out there. Actually, my dad's been doing this for 30 years. Wait, your dad blows up stuff for a living? Yeah, it's the family business. Get out of here. You've never even mentioned it. You never asked. That is the coolest thing I've ever heard. Have you personally set off fireworks? Yeah, many times. Well then, let's make this a first-person narrative. Write about your family and what it was like to grow up in that world. Go home to Wisconsin... Washington. Whatever. We'll run it on the 4th of July. Amy... Yeah. It's nice to see that creative spark again. See if you can get it back on this assignment. Have I been low on spark? Lately, it seems that your heart hasn't been in your work. I need more from you, Amy. You got it. Oh, Jack Johnson tickets. Tonight. Interested? I love Jack Johnson. But I can't tonight, it's just, it's insane, I have to pack, and then Phil's taking me out to dinner. I wasn't inviting you. Well, yeah, he's taking me to one of those fancy restaurants that he adores, but I can't even decipher the menu. I just really don't feel like getting dressed up. Maybe I could convince him to order pizza. What do you think? Look, you're busy with your own stuff. Cancel. Yeah, it's just... It's just not like me to cancel. Then don't. Just make a decision, Amy. Helpful. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. Hello, you! Hi! It's so good to see a friendly face. Guess what? What? I'm coming home to do a story on my parents. Are you kidding? That's wonderful! I know! I haven't been home for 4th of July since... Since I left. Are you wearing a dress? Yes, Phil is taking me to some chic French restaurant, so I figured I should at least try to look nice. French food? You? I know! I know. I'm trying to expand my palate even if it kills me. Stand back. Let me see the shoes. I haven't found them yet. Okay, have you tried your closet? Closet? What's that? You know how tiny my place is. There they are. Why were your shoes in the oven? Did you bake them? No. It's broken, so I've just been using it for storage until the super can get around to fixing it. High heels? You're scaring me, Amy! Wait... Is that rouge on your cheeks? No. It's just, I'm just a little flushed, you know, because the air conditioning keeps coming and going. Mostly going. Well... One day, you're going to let me give you a fresh makeover, and you, too, can look just like this. No, there's only one you, Sammie. True, and I have got something very big to tell you. Can it wait? If I don't go now, I'm going to be late. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. I want to hear your news. Just Skype me the second you get back then. Okay, I will. - Bye! - Bye! Babe, you look absolutely stunning. Thank you. I just, I love it when you get dressed up. Merci beaucoup. De rien, monsieur. Mademoiselle? I'll have a hamburger, please. She's kidding. Honey, I've already ordered for us. You have? To us. Bottoms up. Amuse-bouche. Pistachio, pomegranate, octopus. Merci. Isn't that delicious? I don't know, it was over so fast. Well, wait till you see what's next. You are in for a rare treat. You're really going to a lot of trouble for this. Well, I pulled a few strings. I mean, this place is booked solid all year. But you are so worth it. That's sweet, thank you. Have you had a chance to find a gown for the gala? The gala? Yeah, the black-tie benefit for the opera. When is it again? Honey, it's next weekend, when I get back from Abu Dhabi. Oh, Phil, I'm so sorry, I can't next weekend. No, work is sending me back to Lakeside on assignment, so... It's such an amazing party. What's so funny? It's on fire. I know. It's supposed to be. That's the house specialty. That is as good as the steak Diane at Chez Jean in Paris. I'm sorry, all of this is just... A little lost on me. But I'm sure it's wonderful. Yeah. You must have a sixth sense. I literally just came in from my date. Okay, what's your news? Okay, you're not going to believe it, because I can hardly believe it myself, but... I'm getting married! What? What do you mean you're getting married? I mean, I am tying the knot. I'm saying "I do!" Oh, my gosh, that's amazing! I know, right? Wait, you didn't even tell me you were dating somebody. You've been holding out on me. - Amy? - Yeah? Will you be my maid of honor? Like you even have to ask. Wait, did you set a date yet? When's the wedding? July 4th. Okay, that's soon. Well, I know! But you know that I've always wanted a Fourth of July wedding. I know, I know, but back up. Who's the lucky guy? The guy? The guy! The guy you're marrying! The guy. - Yeah, the guy... - Yeah! Well, as a matter of fact, it's... It's Hank. Hank Lyons? - Yup? - Hank? As in my ex-boyfriend? That was so long ago, and you guys did break up. Yeah. Yes, we did. That's... Awesome. Look! You're getting married! I know, right? Hello? Hey, mom, it's me. Guess who's coming home for a visit? Well, I hope it's you. I'm not a fan of anonymous houseguests. It's me. Your father will be so happy. I am writing a story about you and dad and the business. A story about us? Why? Because you guys do the best small-town fireworks show in the country. Well, when you put it that way... Wait, do I have to be photographed? Yes, of course, you do. I'm going to have to lose five pounds first. You do not need to lose five pounds. You're such a good liar. And I'm not just coming home to do the article. I'm going to be the maid of honor in a wedding. How lovely. Well, who's getting married? Sammie and Hank. Hank? That's a surprise. I know. Well, good for them. I mean, as long as it doesn't bother you, sweetie. I mean, it was a little weird when they first told me, but, you know, I'm happy for them. And I haven't seen him in seven years. Hank is ancient history. Yeah, and you're with Phil now. And I'm with Phil now. Hi! Hey! I... I picked you up a little something, but I forgot to give it to you last night. Thanks, that's... Yeah, it's, it's a forget-me-knot. Get it? Yeah. It's really pretty. Thank you. Okay, I gotta catch a flight. I'll see you soon. Miss you like crazy. One quick thing. I am going to be in a wedding back home for Fourth of July my best friend, Sammie, is getting married. Do you think you could make it? Oh, shoot, I'm still in Geneva. It's okay. No. No, you know what, I'll rearrange things. I'll meet you in Lakeview in time for the wedding. - Lakeside. - Lakeside. Okay, I gotta go. Love you. Bye. Bye. Have a safe flight. Thank you! It's so good to be home. Your father's in the office. He'll want to see you right away. Yeah. Look who's here! Hey! Our big city girl! Hi! It is so good to have you home again. And we have her through the 4th. It hasn't been the same without you. You look thin. Have you been eating? Of course, I have. Wait, hold on. I turned on my phone. Sammie's calling. Hello. I need you right away. How soon can you come over? I can be there in 20 minutes? Yeah, I'll just change, I'll be right there. Okay. Well, it looks like I am on wedding duty. Already? You just got here. I bet it's not going to take that long. And you know Sammie. She's just excited, and it's part of being her maid of honor. I hope. Come on, how hard can it be? Sammie? You made it! Hi. You look so pretty. Thanks. You, too. Did you do something to your hair? I brushed it. It's very flattering. Thank you. Oh, my gosh, it is Fourth of July wedding central here. Yeah, I may have gone a little overboard. You? No... I have a zillion decisions to make. I desperately need your input, Amy. Well, I don't know much about weddings, but I just... what's this? That is for my dad's office. What do you think? I... You know, it's bold. Yes! How is the interior decorating going? It's a little slow. Which reminds me. I need you to "like" me on Facebook. Not me. "Sammie's designs". Got it. You've done so much since I last saw it. I know. It's pretty fabulous, isn't it? Okay... So, how long have you and Hank been together? A while. I don't know, it just, it just sort of... It sort of just happened. We started hanging out, going to movies and dinner. One day, I realized I want to be more than just friends. Amy... I just... I don't want things to be awkward between us. Awkward? - No! Not at all! - No? Good. Oh, good, I'm so relieved, you have no idea. I thought about asking for your blessing. You know, the whole, "don't date your best friend's ex-boyfriend thing", but I chickened out. Stop. Really, like, don't even give it another thought. Hank and I, I mean, that, that was so long ago. Yeah. Right? Yeah. All that matters to me is that you're happy. I am. I want you to be happy, too. I am. I am, and by the way, Phil is going to come to the wedding. Really? That's great. Yeah. It's about time that I met him. I am so excited for us to meet the new wedding planner. I hope that I like her better than the first two. What was wrong with them? Everything. I know it's got to be really hard to do all this without your mom. It's really hard. Yeah. Look, I am so glad that you're here to help me. You might reconsider all the red, white, and blue, dear. It's a bit... Limiting as a color scheme. My wedding is on the Fourth of July. What other color scheme is there? I'm just suggesting you scale back. Maybe use, pops of patriotism here and there. Just a hint of the holiday, you know? Not a... an overload. A hint? What fun is that? You know what it is, I think Sammie just prefers to make a statement. Yes, thank you. See? She gets it. There are many ways to make a statement. I did a Fourth of July wedding last year that was quite elegant. All of the bridesmaids wore simple black gowns... black? This is a wedding, not a funeral. Yes, I understand, but... I don't think you do, Marie. We're having a major disconnect here. Ooh, well, you might be right, dear. My next appointment is here. Why don't you just, talk a look through, and see if there's something that... Speaks to you. Excuse me. Just... You have... Okay, let's just... look. Did I make an appointment? Was that not an appointment? Well... Whatcha doing? I'm trying to decipher Sammie's tuxedo notes. Not to pry, but... that never stopped you before. Just tell me again, why are you marrying Sammie? I proposed, and she said yes. Hey, don't get me wrong, she's a great girl. Fantastic. I just, you know, I always thought you'd end up marrying Amy. Amy? Where'd that come from? I haven't thought about her in years. So there's no lingering feelings about the woman you almost proposed to? None whatsoever. That was a long time ago. Great. Hey, man, I'm just doing my job as best man here, right? Trying to make sure you're ready to take that leap. Dude, I'm totally ready. I've never been happier. Great. Hey, guys. Fred! Hey. My wife baked these for you. Ooh, blueberry. My favorite I.O.U. Just my little way of saying thanks for all your patience and your hard work, huh? Now, that check will be coming soon. Don't sweat it, Fred. We know you're good for it. Come on in, help me choose a tux. Okay. Ooh, what is that? Apple pie? I'm going to get that. You really liked her? I did, I think she's great, and the... babe! Hi, hi! Hey. Amy Peterson, is that really you? Hi. It's good to see you. How you been? Good! Good. It's been so long. It has. Amy. Hank... Congratulations. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, pull up a chair. Come on, have a seat. Grab a seat. This is nice, isn't it? Yeah! The best. All right... Well, I know what I'm getting. So, Amy, what, what brings you back to Lakeside? She's my maid of honor. Really? That's... That's great. You didn't tell him that I'm in the wedding? I could've sworn I mentioned it. No. Yeah, honey. No, I don't... I mean... Well, we know now. Right? I am... I'm hungry. You again. Hey! I thought I might see you here. Part of my daily routine. I remember. So, you and Sammie seem happy. Yeah, we are. And you? Everything's going well with you, right? Yeah, yeah, everything's good. Great. Look, I was thinking about it, and I just don't want it to be awkward, you know, with me being in the wedding, or... No, it won't be. We won't let it. Okay. - So, we're good? - Absolutely. Friends? Friends. See you. Have a good run. Amy? Sweetie, did you hear me? I'm sorry, mom, what did you say? I asked you when Phil's coming in. Not till the first. Just a quick trip, and then he's off to... Genoa or Geneva? I can't remember which. He sure travels a lot. How do you find time to be together? Well, I mean, it's a constant juggling act, but... You know, we don't have a lot of time together, but the time we do have is more than enough, you know? He's a really good guy, and I am glad that you finally get to meet him. Yeah, we are, too. So, how's Chicago? It's... Chicago, you know. My feelings fluctuate depending on the day, the weather, the traffic on Lakeshore drive. I guess I just thought it would be different somehow. Well, how about the paper? Things are going good there, right? I've kind of hit a wall and I don't know why. My editor says I need to step up my game. Is that why you've been sounding so down lately? Maybe. I'm hoping that this article that I'm working on will just turn everything around. I'm sure it will. You'll figure it out, honey. We have faith in you. Thank you. It's Sammie. I should probably take it. Hello? Can you come over now? It's really important. Yeah, I will... I will be there soon. I thought I would give Marie another chance, but she just, she doesn't understand my vision, so I said "forget it! I am not going to let you ruin my wedding". I don't think she'd wreck your wedding... "pops of patriotism". Give me a break. You sure you don't want to meet with her one last time... so, I said, "Marie... We're done". Okay, well, you know, I'm sure there's got to be another wedding planner besides the three you fired... no, no, no, but that's just it, Amy. I don't want another wedding planner. You don't? No! I don't need one. Perfect. I have us. Us? Look, I have tried everyone locally, Amy, but nobody gets me the way you do. You... Are my oldest and closest friend. We are going to have the most fun ever. I promise. Yeah, no, I... I know, it's just I don't think that I'm really the right person for this. And I have the article, and I'm on deadline, and there's just probably not enough time. I just don't know if I can, honestly... here. Don't be ridiculous. I've outlined your responsibilities, so just skim through in your spare time, okay? In my spare time... In my spare time. We have got a lot to do today. There's wedding cake, china, bridesmaid's dresses, flowers... I'm ready. I put you in charge of special wedding fireworks. Sounds great. Can you arrange those with your dad? Absolutely. I'm going to see him later on today to talk about my article, and I will mention it then. Perfect! Yeah. Hi. Hi! Hi, daddy! Hi, honey. Amy Peterson, formerly of Lakeside? How are you, Ben? Oh, fine, thanks. They treating you well at "the post"? They are. Dad, close your eyes! No peeking. Okay. Open. It's... It's... perfect. See? Maybe now you'll let me decorate your whole office. Let's get through the wedding first and then we'll talk about it, but thank you. Good to see you, Amy. Nice to see you, too. - Bye! - Bye. Bye, dad! He seems good. Yeah, he's great. It's time for cake. Hank's going to meet us there. Okay. These look wonderful. Hi, Hank. There's my groom. - Hey. - Hey. Couldn't pass up the free cake, huh? I go where my taste buds are needed. Let's start with the red velvet. Your favorite. My favorite. It's tasty. What's this one, Helen? White chocolate. That is an O.M.G. Try it, you guys. It's a little sweet. Amy? Don't you just love it? I don't know, I can't really say. Try the lemon cake. It's very popular with our summer brides. Refreshing. It's too tangy. Sorry, I'm vetoing the lemon. No offense, Helen. No, none taken. So, it's between the white chocolate and the red velvet. - White chocolate. - Red velvet. White chocolate, Hank. I would like to change my vote to white chocolate. Great. Now, for the design... Amy, can you open to page 377? Yes. 377. Okay, okay... 377. Yeah. I want that. In white chocolate. It goes perfectly with my theme. "Stars and stripes, and Sammie and Hank forever. That's catchy. I'll get right on it. Every time I see my china, I'll remember the wedding. What do you think? It's... nice. You hate it. No. No, no, no, it's... It's very upbeat. Amy? What do you think? Yeah, I... I like this. Right? It's too plain. I'm going to go check out the stemware. Hi! I'm Dinah. Are you two lovebirds here to register? No, I'm not. He is. I'm sorry. No, I'm marrying that little lady over there. She's lovely. She is. All right, I have to got get going. You... ...can take it from here. It's getting heavier. Bye. Bye. ...in 12 or six, I'm planning on having some very large parties. Bye. Thank you, hon'. I'm planning on having very big parties, so I'm going to need a lot of this one. Amy Peterson? Sylvia! Hi! Hi! I don't believe it. I haven't seen you in forever. I know, not since we worked on the newspaper in college. You look great. You, too! Oh, please, I have eight pounds of makeup on. High definition is so unforgiving. Well, that's one of the perks of working in print. Are you still in Chicago? Yeah, I am. You're so lucky you escaped. Unlike me, still stuck in sleepy old Lakeside. I don't know, you seem to be doing just fine. Well, they haven't kicked me off the air just yet. I'm on in five. So good seeing you. You, too. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, dad, where are you hiding all the fireworks? What do you need? Well, I want to take some pictures for my article. And then Sammie wants something special for her wedding. Okay, well, here, pick out something you like, and I'll have to order it. We don't have much in stock. Yeah, I noticed that. It seems like inventory's pretty low for this time of year. Yeah, it's been kind of tight the last couple months. Why didn't you say something? I didn't want to worry you. Did something happen? No, no, no, it's just a couple of cancellations. No big deal. Wait, you're not getting the town fireworks till July 3rd? That barely gives you any time to set up. Come on, dad, you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself. Yeah, I don't like it any more than you do, honey, it's just, this year I didn't have any choice. So, what are you going to do? I'm going to focus on the Fourth of July, and after that, that should bring everything up to speed. Dad, no one does the Fourth like you, but I still think that's cutting it pretty close. Once we get the town's payment, everything will be fine. Well, what can I do? Oh, no, no, you've got enough on your plate. Yeah, but so do you. At least I can work on the stuff for Sammie. I know what she likes. Okay, well, you know how much your mom and I love working with you. Me too. Okay, Sammie will definitely want "wow". Wow. This is really bright. Someone has to rein Sammie in. The whole Fourth of July theme has gone too far. Amy... You're elected. Me? What am I going to say? I have no power over her. You're her best friend. You have to think of something. Please? Hah! Look at you! What do you think? Be honest. Your arms look incredible. Your waist looks tiny. Your country salutes you. Do you really like it? - We really do. - We really do. Maybe... Some more red. What about blue roses? I don't have those. We'd have to dye them. Perfect. I know just the shade of blue I want. I'll send over a sample. And tiny American flags? In the bridal bouquet? Yeah. You know what, let's just keep it going for the boutonnieres and the bridesmaids bouquets, too? I think we might have to do a Fourth of July intervention. Hang in there. My work here is done. I'll see you later. Great choices. You again. I just have a minute while Sammie finishes up the order in there. I need a favor. Okay... I'm in charge of the rehearsal dinner, I could really use your help. I know it's a lot to ask, but... I can't do this on my own. Hank, I just don't know if I can do it. I don't think I have time. Look, I've got the article about my folks, and the bridal shower is coming up. Sammie's got me booked solid. Well, Sammie wants your help. She said so. Okay. Yes! You're the best. Thank you, Amy! You're welcome. I think. Okay. Deliveries out back, service entrance. No, sorry, we have an appointment with the manager, Mr. Roth. Do you really? Yeah. 11:00. I think we're early. If you insist. This way, please. I don't know about this place, Amy. It's a little... Pretentious? Exactly. You want to leave? You read my mind. So... Is now a good time to mention that we're lost? We're not lost. The eagle's nest is around here somewhere. The question is where? Maybe I prefer taking the scenic route. I just saw a sign for Lew's barbecue. Aw, wouldn't you love some of his famous ribs right now? That sounds great, but we've got our meeting at the eagle's nest. We can send the caterer a text, tell them we're going to be late. Lew could give us directions. Directions, huh? Just in case. Not that we need them come on, we're so close. We have had a lot of good times there. The best. I finally figured out the seating plan. Hey, where's Amy? She's with Hank. They're checking out places for the rehearsal dinner. Alone? Sammie, have you officially lost your mind? Of course not. Look, what if they still have feelings for each other? They're friends now. It's okay for them to hang out. I mean, does it get any better than this? No. No, it doesn't. You know what, if I could pick my last meal, it would definitely be a plate of Lew's ribs. There's that dark side coming out. Come on, if you've gotta go, you may as well do it with Lew's barbecue sauce just dripping all over your face, right? It certainly makes for a charming visual. You got something. There you go. Thanks. Hank and Amy? Amy and Hank? Lew! Is it really you or am I seeing things? My eyes are all teary from chopping up onions for the sauce. Onion? Now, is that the secret? No. What is it? Hey, like I'm going to tell her. Next thing you know, it'll be splashed across the front page of "The Seattle Observer". Actually, Amy's with "The Chicago Post". Impressive. Well, that explains why you never come and see me anymore. So, what's your excuse? I... don't have one yet. Get back to me when you do. So, what else can I get you? Peach cobbler? Twist my arm. A scoop of vanilla, right? Aw, you remembered. I always remember my best customers, even if they abandon me. We'll just take one. We can split it. We're cooking up a fresh batch. It'll be done in about five minutes. - Thanks, Lew. - Thanks, Lew. What? Let's go see if our bench is still there. Come on. Come on. Yeah. There's something about this place, it just... Makes you want to camp out here forever. Eating ribs. And corn bread. And peach cobbler. Yeah. Hey, I know this is going to sound crazy to a big city sophisticate like yourself. Yeah, that's me. But do you think there's any way we could have the rehearsal dinner here? At Lew's? Yeah. Well, I don't really know how Sammie would feel about it. Has she... been here? No, but, I mean, we could dress it up for her, make it look really nice. Maybe put some lights outside? Get some good music going? Get some linen napkins, tablecloths, maybe even those, paper lanterns? Yes. I think it could be really beautiful. Yeah. Yeah, I think you're... You're right. Great. Lew's it is. Lew's it is. We need it to look pretty, Lew. Pretty? Barbecue isn't pretty. Barbecue is messy. Can you do pretty? Tell you what. I'll supply the food and drink, and you supply the pretty just by being here. Always a charmer. And you're a lucky guy. It's about time you two got hitched. Congratulations. No, no, Lew, we're not getting married. What? No, we haven't been together for a long time. Is that so? Yeah, he's, marrying my best friend. Good one. Hey... Not a joke. You could've fooled me. The old house... This is the old house. Thanks again for your help. I really couldn't have done this without you. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah. Okay. Hey, before you go, there's something I've been wanting to say. Okay. I'm just really glad things are working out for you in Chicago. You know, you took a huge step, and it's paying off. Most people wouldn't have the guts to move away and follow their dreams. Not you, Amy. You're fearless. Yeah, I... I know it probably seems pretty good on paper, this big hectic life I have, but... Sometimes I just feel like none of it is real. Like if I were to look beneath the surface, I just wouldn't find anything, and... What... Sorry, what are you saying exactly? I don't know, I'm just... I'm just babbling. Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's going on? You can talk to me, you know. I know. I've never met anyone who was easier to talk to than you. You just have such a... Wonderful way about you, Hank. I hope I told you that when we were together. You told me all the time. Good night, Hank. Good night, Amy. Why are you guys working so late? It's a beautiful night. You look... I don't know how to say it... You look happy. Well, Hank and I found a place for the rehearsal dinner today, so... Yeah, one thing to check off my list. You guys are so old school. Do you know, I tried to link your website in the article today, and then I realized... We don't have a website. We barely have a computer. I know, but I'm worried about you guys. You've got to be more competitive. Market yourself. But you know we've always been word of mouth. Yeah, my mouth. I'm putting that in the article. Be my guest. No, but I'm serious. Word of mouth is not enough anymore. You should get into social media. Build a website, start tweeting. We're Luddites, that's beyond us. Yeah, we'd have to hire somebody. No, no, no. I could teach you of the basics. It's actually not that hard to get going. Oh, no, you have enough going on, especially with the bridal shower tomorrow. You don't have time. Mom, this is important, and it's fun. How about this, before I head back to Chicago, I'll get you guys up and running. How do you say no to that? Best... Bridal. Shower. Ever! I'm so glad you like it. Like it? Try love it. You went all out. I mean, I had help. Oh, please, the way you've been there for me, Amy, the way you've brought it, 110%, I can't thank you enough. Aw... I am so lucky to have you in my life. I'm lucky to have you in my life. Guys, isn't it time for... Time for what? The game. Oh, right. Yes, yes, yes, okay. Who is ready for the toilet paper dress and veil game? It's my favorite! We have our bride. What? No... No, wait... Wait no! Okay, Sammie, pick a winner. Who's it gonna be? It's a tough call. Because they're all so fashion forward, and ultra soft, but... If I had to choose, I'm going to go with... Team Amy. Yes. That means you're next, Amy. That dress is so you, Amy. Yeah, see, I was going for T.P. Chic. Well, you've definitely achieved that. Oh, Hank. I'll just... - Hi! - Hey. Hey. Come on, I want to show you the gifts I got. - A waffle-maker! - Sweet. - You like it? - I love it. Come here. It was a wonderful shower. You did such a great job. Sammie loved it. Amy? Sweetie, are you okay? No, I'm not. What's wrong? I know it's going to sound crazy, but I think I have feelings for Hank. Oh, dear. It just sort of crept up on me. I haven't thought about him in years, and now I just can't stop thinking about him, and I... I can't have feelings for Hank. I'm with Phil, and Hank's marrying Sammie, and it... It just makes no sense. Well, it makes some sense. You're about to lose him for good, and it's all just starting to hit you. I'm so confused, mom. What do I do? Well, it's complicated, sweetie. I don't know if there's anything you can do. You're right. I just have to face reality. Hank and I are not meant to be. Hank is marrying Sammie, and there's nothing I can do to change that. Hey, look who I found. Hey. You must be Gloria. Phil, nice to meet you. Yeah, you, too. Hi. Babe, I made it. Yes, you did. It's... It's so great that you're here. Thanks. Lakeview. ...Side. Lakeside, right. Lakeside... This town really gets into the Fourth of July. It's great. Yeah, we really know how do the Fourth around here. I can see that. I always say, if you're going to do something, do it big, otherwise, don't do it at all. You never told me that your family was all part of all this? I've mentioned it a few times. I bet they put the spectacle in spectacular. I can't wait to see it. I really think that... what else have you been hiding from me? Hiding? N-Nothing. No, I mean, what other Fourth of July surprises do you have in store for me? Phil! This is so exciting. I can't believe I finally get to meet you. Sammie. The pleasure's all mine. Great suit, by the way. Thank you. Okay, come on. I am dying for you to see the tuxes. Come on. Come on. This is some bow tie. Yes, it is. Sammie's definitely got an eye for, details. Yes, she does. Do I seriously have to wear this thing? If I do, you do. Okay, fine, you owe me one. Hey, how's the rehearsal dinner going? Really great. Yeah. Yeah, Amy's been such a big help. I forgot how she was so... So, what? Are these sleeves too long? Honey! Hey. You look amazing. Amy, don't they look amazing? Yes, they look amazing. Hank and Andy, this is Phil. - Phil, Hank and Andy. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Good to meet you. Those are... Those are great bow ties, you guys. I know, right? Great for a Fourth of July wedding. Exactly. No, where are the matching cummerbunds? You read my mind. Doesn't that just finish the look? Absolutely. Good morning. Hey, Phil, it's supposed to be a hot one today you may want to lose that suit and put on a pair of Bermudas. No, thanks, Charlie, I'm fine. I feel more comfortable in a suit. Okay. Hello? Hi, bill. Oh, no. When? Okay. Yeah, we'll see you then. We'll be there. Bye. The water main broke last night. The city council wants us to come to a special meeting this morning. What, now? Yeah, now. Well, let's go. Listen, hon', I'm sorry, I can't come. I have to wait here for a conference call. That's okay. There's nothing you could really do there anyway. I'll come back and get you when we're done, okay? Are you sure? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Enjoy breakfast. Thanks. Good luck. Hank! Hey! Hey... Hey, it's good to see you. You too. Hi. What a mess, huh? It's awful, isn't it? The council called an emergency session. Yeah, we should probably go over there. Do you mind if I tag along? You don't... you don't have to. I'd really like to. Yeah, come with us. To repair the water main. The only way around this is to reallocate the monies slated for the fireworks. I'm so sorry. Now, hang on there, bill. We've already ordered the fireworks. There must be something... I'm afraid we have no choice in the matter, folks. It's already been decided. The Fourth of July fireworks show has been canceled. We can't weather the loss of this job. We're going to have to sell the company. Hey, wait a minute, no one's selling anything. Come on, you can't give up hope. Maybe we can raise the money on our own. I don't like asking people for money. Neither do I. It's not charity, it's tradition. We have had fireworks at the Fourth of July in Lakeside every year that I've been alive, and I can't picture it without it. I know the town would rally around that. Don't you think? Yeah, I mean, it's ambitious, but it's definitely not impossible. Nothing's impossible. Okay, so, now that I opened my big mouth, I've got to make it happen. I think corporate sponsorship's the best way to go. Hit up some of the bigger players in town. I like the thinking. You know, if you want, I could help. I'm in rotary with a lot of those guys. That would be amazing. Cool. Hey, Sammie... I need a favor. We can't do Fourth of July without fireworks. Thank you so much, Ben. This is a great start. Yeah, thanks, Ben. I wish I could do more. Can you think of anyone else who might want to contribute? I'd happy to make a few calls. That would be huge, thank you. Hey. - Hank, how you doing? - Hey. Good. What a great place to get married on the Fourth of July. It's all coming together quite nicely, don't you think? It really is beautiful. I was thinking about the Fourth of July, and I don't think that we can raise enough money, not one sponsor at a time. Honey, I'm happy to make a donation. Thanks Phil. That's great, man. Yeah, no, whatever I can do to... follow me, everybody, follow me! Now, listen, I want the chairs facing the water. Facing the water! In two sections on either side of the aisle! Excuse me, I'll go see if I can help out. Great. Yeah, I still think we need a different fund raising approach. I don't know, maybe one of those kickstarter campaigns? Yes! I see those on Facebook all the time. Right, they do help you just reach a lot of people fast. In two sections on either side of the aisle, okay? We have to make sure that everybody can see the swans floating behind us. Swans, what a nice touch. I'm so glad you agree. You know, I never would have thought of that. It's up here. No. No, no, no. Not the black arch. I wanted the white arch. Fellas, look, she doesn't like the arch. Amy! Amy, can you come here! Andy's really great with social media. Maybe he could tweet something? Right, and maybe we could have the radio station do an ad, "help us save the Fourth". Perfect. Can we put the fireworks on hold for a second? Sure. Did you order the black wedding arch from the rental company? No, I ordered the white one. Can you go talk to the guys? Sure. Okay. Actually, I've already handled it. Thank you. My pleasure. I am having fun. Hon', I tell you, I love Lakeview. - Lakeside. - Lakeside. What I... sorry. The bows look great. How's the fund raising website coming? It's almost finished. Here, take a look. Very impressive. There. It's ready to launch. Do you really think this will work? I do. Okay, here we go. Come on, Lakeside. She looks beautiful. I know. Yes... Go back and check the next batch of ribs. I just, I wish you'd have been there. Yeah, me too, but I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you could make it. There's the happy couple. It's amazing. This is so good. Hey, how you doing? Sammie, look at you, you look fantastic. Oh, why, thank you. I think we pulled it off. Yeah, and Lew didn't think that we could do pretty. We showed him. What us that color? Is... is that coral? Yes! It's my favorite color. Well, it should be. It suits you perfectly. It really does look fantastic, doesn't it? Yeah. It's such a special place. It's all incredible. Thank you, both. There's my girl. Dad! You look wonderful, honey. Hank. Ben. This is fun, right? Yeah. Why don't I grab us a drink? I'm good. You go get something. I'll be right here. Thank you. See you in a bit. Bye. Lew! Looks great, huh? It looks amazing. Fourth of July! Yes. You okay with all this? Yeah. It... it's great. I mean, your guy marrying someone else. He's... he's not my guy. I'm with Phil now. Right over there. Right, right. Come on. How are the kids? My daughter, Carol, is 12 now. You're kidding. Where did the time go? Whoosh! Oh, my gosh. Hey, Lew. Everything looks great. She's the visionary. That, she is. Thank you. Hey, you want to dance? I don't know. Come on, for old time's sake? A man asks you to dance, you dance. May I have this dance? Indeed. Hey, how are the contributions for the kickstarter site? They're pretty good. Not enough to save the day. Right. Well, let's not give up hope yet. Okay. This is fun. Yeah! Look at them. Awfully chummy. Enough, you two. Give it a rest. What? It's funny, there was a time where I thought it would be you and me getting married. Really? Yeah, I was going to propose. I had a ring and everything. When was that? Years ago, Fourth of July. We went down to the docks, and you told me you were leaving for Chicago. And I didn't... Can I steal my fiance for a dance? Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. I thought I'd come out and show you a few moves. I don't mind... I-I'm sorry... I just have to go check on something. Yeah.. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm happy. Yeah? Found you. Hey. You okay? Yeah... I'm just thinking. You should probably go back inside. Hi, everybody. If I could have your attention. Come on into the main area here and bring your glasses. It's time to toast the almost married couple. Yes. Sammie and Hank, come on up. There she is. Sammie... All right, and Hank. All right, Hank, we know you're here. Hank? Hank? Come on, what's wrong? You can tell me. You were going to ask me to marry you and I ruined everything. I just... thought you wanted something else. I went after the wrong dream. I just didn't realize it, and... And I lost the person that I cared about the most. And now I... And now what? What? And I'm pretty sure I'm in love with you, Hank. You are? Yeah. I don't believe this. Sammie, just... No, I didn't see it before, but now I get it. The only reason you're here is to steal Hank away from me. Sammie, come on. I would never do that to you. You don't expect me to believe that, do you? But it's true. I would never do that to you. Hank? Will you help me out here, Hank? Because I really feel like I'm losing my mind. Was all of this just smoke and mirrors? No, of course... of course not. Everything? Us? The plans we made? We have to calm down and discuss this... what's the point? Sammie... So, we'll... Sammie, what... What are you doing? Stop. Sorry to spoil the party, but... The wedding is off. And if you want to know why, you can ask Amy Peterson. Oh, man. Hey, buddy. Hey... Hey... Sammie, please wait. Please? It's not what you think. It's exactly what I think! It's so obvious now! I must've been blind not to see how much you wanted Hank back. No, that's not it at all, Sammie, I... just leave me alone, okay? Sammie, please... Please, it's not what you think! Sammie, please. Please, just... Wait. Wait! Where's she going? I don't know, and I feel like it's all my fault. Okay, tonight was crazy. We need to put whatever that was on hold, at least for now, okay? I know. You're right. We need to find her. Okay. Amy, what's going on? I'm so sorry. I owe you an explanation, but I can't do it now... I've got to go find Sammie. I will explain to you back at the house, I promise. Come on, go, go. There she is. You just go. She made it really clear she doesn't want to speak to me. I'll talk to her. Hey, Sylvia. What's going on? We're doing a piece on the Fourth of July cancellation. Do you... Do you think you could interview me? I'm trying to raise funds to save the fireworks show. Sure. Yeah, we can get your family's perspective. Yeah, I'll just, I'll set it up and bring you in. That would be great. Thank you. Yeah. No problem. Good evening. This is Sylvia Sherwin, coming to you live from downtown Lakeside, where the aftermath of the water main explosion is everywhere. Holiday cheer has fizzled on the eve of independence day. This is Amy Peterson, whose parents, Gloria and Charlie Peterson, of Peterson pyrotechnics, put on the fireworks show every year. Now, tell us, Amy, how are they dealing with the cancellation? Well, they're disappointed, just like the rest of Lakeside. It's not the Fourth of July without fireworks. No, it isn't, which is why we started a website campaign to raise money. We are doing everything in our power to save the Fourth of July. You don't have much time left, do you? No, but with the help of the good people of Lakeside, it is definitely possible. Please donate whatever you can, tonight. Amy Peterson, looking for a Fourth of July miracle. This is Sylvia Sherwin, reaction news. Back to you in the studio. Thank you, Sylvia... She did good. That was great. ...you can make a contribution by going to the website below... Hey. Hi... Everyone. We should give them some space. Phil, I'm so sorry. What happened tonight? Everything just spun out of control so fast, and I didn't expect anything to happen. I... I thought Hank and I were just friends, but then all my feelings for him came back and I feel just terrible, because you're... You're such a good guy, and you've been so sweet to me. You don't deserve this. You really don't, and... Amy. Amy... We've had... A lot of really good times together, but... I've never really thought you were "the one", and I know that you've never thought of me that way. Listen, it's okay. Right? We're different. Sooner or later, we were bound to go our separate ways. So, we're... breaking up? This is your home, not Chicago. This is where you belong, this is where you're happiest. You think so? I know so. Yeah. Look, I'm going to check into a hotel tonight, so, do me a favor and thank your folks for me. Thank you, Phil, so much, for understanding. Thanks, Scott. Really appreciate it. Hamilton came through. Delivery in a few hours. Wald and Orion came through, too. Just waiting to hear back from Corey from northwest display. Well, not to be a killjoy here, but isn't it a big gamble, ordering fireworks we haven't raised enough money to pay for? Well, we've got to replace the order that we canceled. Keep the faith, mom. Well, I guess I'll make a fresh pot of coffee. Come. I will. I'll get you some. I really managed to make a mess of everything. I lost my best friend and destroyed her wedding, in the same night, and in record time. I'm so sorry, sweetie, but I am sure it will all work itself out. And then Phil and I broke up. I mean, mom, I am really on a roll. Now, what about Hank? What is going on with him? I'm not sure. Amy? Amy! What is it? You did it! You did it! Look! Look! We all did it. What? What did we do? We raised enough money for the fireworks. It's too much wonderful, I have to sit down! Crisis averted and I got a great ending for my article. Just not sure I can say the same for my life, though. Can I come in? You're going to anyway. A cupcake. Our tradition. You think cupcakes can make everything better? No. But I think they can help. Sammie, I... I just want you to know that I honestly thought Hank was just a part of my past. And then I... I came back home, and... All these old feelings started... They just started resurfacing, feelings that I promise you, I had no intention at all of sharing with him, but... then you told him anyway. I remember. I was there. Sammie, I'm so sorry. Just so you know, I'm not ready to forgive you yet. I understand. Phil and I broke up. Hank and I had a talk last night. We've decided not to go through with the wedding. But it just... It just hit me, you know, that I've been lying to myself, pretending I could create this great life with him. It was just a big fantasy. My mom would've set me straight. You know, she would have said, I was in love with the wedding more than anything else. That's not the right reason to get married. I never meant to hurt you. You know that, right? I know, I do know. This is a big moment for us. You know, we've been through a lot together, and we said we'd be best friends forever. So, I have to ask you a really important question. How long do you plan on being mad at me? I might make you suffer a little longer. Fair enough. Well, in the meantime, maybe you would want to help me with the Fourth of July picnic? Because I could really use your expertise. I am not in the mood for a picnic. Okay. All right, well... Just think about it. I might have an opening in my schedule. I know. See? It's so good. Hi. Hey. Walk with me? This is weird. Is this weird? A little. Yeah. Hey, congratulations. For what? You saved the Fourth of July. With your help. I didn't do much. Yeah, you did. Everyone else thought I was nuts and you backed me. We... we made a great team. "Made?" As in past tense? Well, yeah, I have disrupted your life in a pretty major way, twice now, so I wouldn't blame you for wanting to keep me in the past tense. Look, when you left for Chicago, I had to find some way of moving forward without you. I know. And I was doing okay... Until you came back. And after spending all this time with you, Amy, I've realized how much I love you. You do? Yes. Yes, I do, and... I know Chicago is far away, but... there's no more Chicago. What? Phil and I broke up, and, I decided that I'm not going back. Because I wasn't happy. And my home is in Lakeside, with the people that I love. With you. Sammie... Everything looks amazing. I know, right? Yeah. You have a real knack for party planning. You could do this full-time. I mean, if you ever decided you didn't want to do interior decorating anymore. That is such a wonderful idea. Okay, so... I sent in my article to "the post", and they put it on the front page. I really like that picture. I can't wait to read it. I also sent in my resignation. You did? I just want to be doing something that I really love. So, I thought that maybe I would apply for the much-needed marketing position at the company. You're hired! Aw, let's get everything done. Let's light up the skies for Lakeside. Come on, dad. I love it. Well, that should do it. We're ready to begin. Amy, will you do the honors? With pleasure. Safety first. Okay. Hello, Sammie. Phil, hi! I thought you'd left. I just, I kind of wanted to stick around and watch these amazing fireworks. Nice hat. You too. You look great in red, white and blue, by the way. Don't you just love the Fourth of July? Yes, I do. It is now my new favorite holiday. Join me? I'd love to. Ooh... It's so good. You know, if you ever did want to pop the question, I hear the Fourth of July's a really great day to do it. - You think? - Yeah. Amy Peterson, I love you. I never want to lose you again. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Let me think about it. Yes! Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM
