A guy came and took all the merchandise. - A guy? - Just one guy. He was a cop. What? Noncompliance to standards? It says "stainless steel". I know, honey, but they found lead in it. Lead teapots, can you believe it? I couldn't send them back. No way, Sami... Yes way, Sami! Don't worry, I have an idea. A factory in Lithuania... Yes, Lithuania is...

Know what your big flaw is? He's lazy! A coward! A liar! No, he's very sweet. Thanks, Mrs. Ronssin! Your flaw is you won't grow up. My salary alone can't pay our debts. The company's cutting back. We're sinking. We'll have to move and you didn't even finish the room! You're mixing everything up. No, I'm not. You're scared. Terrified. I'm terrified? - I'm terrified? - Yes, you're terrified. Between you and me, do we have to keep it? Sami, I'm eight months pregnant. Sit tight till I shape up. You're not funny anymore. You're almost a dad, so get real. Find a job and keep it. - We'll make it, honey. - No, we won't. Stop lying to yourself! Stop lying, period. At worst we sell the TV or the couch. No, not the couch. Where will I sleep?

We have the new "Zelda". - Not released yet. - I finished it. I knew you had nothing here. What's that? They lent us a statue for the new film. It's not for sale. Mr. Pouzier. Hello, security post? Yes, it's all good. Spiderman Red and Spiderman Black are in place. No worries. I'll secure the area. My sleep strategy of pretending on purpose to sleep worked well. I'm coming. Shit! Control? I'm running late. Have some coffee. Hey, colleagues, thanks! Wait... - Sorry. - Idiot. I didn't mean it! Don't move. Take this. That stings! I want that. It stings! I'm so sorry. I'm stuck too. The Spiderman? No, that. Venom? No, him. - The gentleman? - The gentleman. I'll manage alone. No, we can't give him to you. Why not? My belt! Because it's impossible. He's a man... We can't give you a man... He's not for sale. My father will be upset. One minute. André Pouzier, director of the store. - You are? - Sami Cherif. I seemed to be asleep, but no! I was honing a surveillance technique. - Excellent technique. - Really? Mr. Cherif, that young boy there 'vs the boss' son. The big boss. I don't know what got into him, but... he wants to take you home. Me? To his place? What for? To play- Your shift is almost done, but just a few hours. You'll have your job tomorrow. I promise. Sir, I'm sorry. I'm paid to guard, not babysit. You're not paid to sleep on the job. I could fire you. That's not false. Alexandre is the son of Philippe Etienne. You understand? - Who? - Philippe Etienne. Who's that? We all work for him here, including you. Really... yes. 1,000 euros. Sorry? 1,000 euros. Go back with him, spend a few hours together.

You outdo Santa Claus! A Monopoly in your name? This is wild! A Monopoly with your face! Crazy! I'm not playing that. Follow me. Don't wanna play you? Too bad. I'll clean up. Jean-Louis, the butler. Your name is Jean-Louis? Yes, Jean-Louis. Coming? Follow him, Gunther. Only if I feel like it. I feel like it. Get this into your fat head. I'm not... Gunther! This is still your room? Unbelievable. Incredible! Dad's a drug trafficker? Play. This? I'm warning you, I'm unbeatable. Each point I win by is another year you're my toy. It's your risk. Just don't cry if you lose! - Ready? - Whenever!

Milo, what is this madhouse? Your son's birthday present, sir. Great! My toy! Know what? I'll call you Gunther. Come, Gunther! Don't call me Gunther. Erase that. Need help, ma'am? Don't bother, sir. It's my job. You sure? Who said to get off? I never said to help her. Mr. Alexandre! You came from the left. We had priority. Our policeman will report it. Write her up a ticket. I didn't run the light, officer. No worries, ma'am. You just have to... I said not to help her. Confiscate her license. Is that understood? National Police, hello. Who are you to give orders to the police? Do as I say, Gunther. I ask the questions! And I answer them too. Out of my way. This car doesn't seem in order. You can't drive inside a house. Frankly, it's wrong! I said give her a ticket, dummy! Gosh damn! Insulting an on-duty officer? Oh boy! You'll get 20 years minimum! I doubt it. I'm Philippe Etienne's son! Gosh damn! Attempted bribery! Did I hear correctly? - You heard it. - Yes. You heard it? - Hands on the hood. - Not on your life. I said: "Hands on the hood". I said: "Not on your life"! Enough! Learn manners! You'll see who you're messing with! - You a wise guy? - Let go! Are you a wise guy? Let go! - Who's the boss? - I am! Wrong answer. Who's the boss? Ian-I! You have no manners, so I'll teach you. - Let go! - I'll teach you... to pick UP"- some manners! Opel'! up! I can't hear! Get me out of here! - Thank you. - No problem, ma'am. Ana Maria. Sami. Muchas gracias, Sami. Let me out! You almost broke my arm! What's going on? Nothing, Daddy. We're playing. Hello, son. Mr. Etienne, Sami Cherif. I work at your store. I'm aware of this. My assistant will tend to you. Who is that man? My new toy. Meaning? Nothing, it's my gift. You don't buy people. He's a human being, a person. You said: "I have no time, take whatever you want." Alexandre, return that toy immediately. Did you say it or not? Do it again, I'll open you like a Russian doll. I'll cram your siblings inside. I'm an only child. Sorry, it's my... Excuse me. Can you give me my check and drive me home? I'll draw up a contract for you to sign, and we'll pay you your due. Everything's in order. You'll be driven to the station. After dinner. Of course, sweetheart. After dinner, Mr. Cherif. Family, friends, Double-Spout Sami here. Leave a message. Where are you? I need you. One of our wines? Yes, sir. Domaine de la Solitude. No thanks, I have tons already. I'm good. Wazuh beef tataki with strawberries. Toufik'? What's a Wazuh? It's beef. And it's Jean-Louis, sir. What? No talking during meals? Depends on what we have to say. Enjoy! Something wrong, sir? It's exquisite. Very exquisite. You eat this every day? Mouloud, any more beef tachini? It's Jean-Louis, sir. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, son. Is that it? That wasn't a very happy birthday. Where's all the family, friends, aunts? The gummy bears? And the candles? I'm not hungry. Goodnight, Mr. Cherif. Goodnight, Mr. Etienne. What am I signing? It bars you from telling anyone about what happened here. I can tell my wife. No. I'll keep him for the night. Chucky is acting up. Coachman, home please. One moment please. Thank you for tonight's dinner. And thanks for this. Perhaps you find my son not easily approachable. For the first time since his mother died, he's shown a desire. And this desire is you. He's brave. Since his mother left us a year ago, he desires nothing. If it made him happy, I'm happy- Perhaps you'll find the magnanimity to prolong this experience? The experience of being a toy? No thank you. Alexandre simply needs a companion. The inconvenience will be remunerated. It's not about the money. I have to go. My wife's waiting. It's important. Thank you, though. You're very kind. Goodbye. 2,000 euros. Not to be disrespectful, you already paid me. I have all I need. Goodnight. A day. 2,000 a day... makes 24... 4... When you say 2,000 a day, you mean 24-hour days? That's right. You'll do experiments on me? You'll remove one of my shoulder blades or a knee? 14,000 a week, renewable. We need more banners! - Alice? - Sami? You're not home? Why are you there? Where's Alice? We're having a union meeting. The company's insolvent. The redundancy plan includes 50 layoffs. Not just old people. Where are you? I've been calling. I was scared. Don't worry. I can't talk, I'm stuck here. I found the job of a lifetime! Stop, what are you talking about? Samira, put them there! Listen to me! I can't talk, too many people. We need markers. - Red tape too? - And red and black spray paint! Ask your brother, the loafer. I can't ask him. Az beat him up thanks to you. Get moving. That's what I'm doing! I've never moved so much in my life. I'm settling all our problems. Gone! This is the deal of the century! I've come across some people... How can I put it? They're dumbbells. They're idiots, I've never seen hamars like them. And they're nice. They're nice people. They look like Mary Poppins and Bruce Willis. This is incredible. What the hell is it? Are we in space? We're in space here! This is wild! We're in Star Trek. This is madness! Mercury, Venus and Earth will be reduced to ashes. The sun will die out. If you enjoyed this, click on "subscribe" or "like". Bye. Shut off. Too bad. You post videos? My channel popularizes astrophysics. I recognize this kryptonite from Superman. No, it's a meteorite. And it's called a pallasite. Over 4 billion years old. Hands off! One day I'll go to Mars. They found a dune there with blue sand. I personally wouldn't go there if I could. It's hot and there's no one. "I personally" is redundant. And FYI, you don't say: "Enjoy". You may as well say: "Enjoy, stomach" or "Enjoy, bowel". Personally, I think you need a beating. Personally, I... Come and fight. What was that? Flamenco? - Come! - You're on guard, zerma? You want to fight me? Come, I said. Do that in my hood and they steal your pajamas. Scram! Come back in 50 pounds. Up. No way! I can't believe it! Seriously, what the hell? How the hell can this be? There are no, no... there are no... What is this thing? As a kid, I had bunk beds. You have the bed but no bunk. - I bet the Russians made it. - Go to bed. How can I sleep here? There. Not there! I want an anti-gravity bed. Shall I call my father? Liking you is tough. Night. Fuck... What are you doing? Answer me please. Where are you? You better have a good excuse! Hi, this is Alice. Message after the beep. I don't know your intentions, but that work of art is worth 2 million euros. I went closer to... get a better look. I didn't see it well. Two million euros? At that price, they could have thrown in the flush. Who decides if it's art? Artists give their vision of the object. You decide if it's art. And this... Its... A Bertholon. Not a zebra? Ah, yeah... Klimt. - Gold period. - You like painting. I did a puzzle of that, lots of times. What about that? Is it art? It was, until my son vandalized it. It was my favorite statue. Why don't you clean it? My son doesn't want to. Do you have children? No. Yes. My wife, well, my partner, is sort of pregnant. What's it like to be a father? When the baby is born. It's nothing. Then the child becomes your entire life. I don't think men are made to be fathers. It's so complicated. So you're spending some time with us? I ironed your shirt. What time is it? 9:00. Did you sleep well, Mr. Sami? I couldn't sleep, not enough noise. Hot! That smells good! Amazing madeleines! May I? Dream on, Gunther! They're my babies. Don't be an ass, just one. No! They're my babies. Don't call me... Mr. Gunther, I'm Henri, the driver. I was asked to take you home to pack some stuff. Where's the kid? He gets back from surfing school at 1. Surfing school? - Where can you surf here? - Biarritz. - Biarritz? - The best waves. He's in Biarritz? Every Tuesday. Biarritz every Tuesday? Tuesday mornings. Can he pick up mustard in Dijon? Because he goes to Biarritz to surf. It's as if I said: if he stops in Provence, can he buy herbs? It's the same category of... - Seriously? - What up, Snoop? I said I'd make it, guys! Auntie! Sami! How are you? What are you doing in that car? Is it yours? What a beauty! You're Uber? I'm Henri. It's a notch above. A round of gyros on me! Honey! I have amazing news. So you're here? - It's wild! - Sleep well? I met someone, a businessman. Not even a businessman. This man does all the business in the system. You won't believe who it is. - Have a seat. - Yes, I'll sit. Is Etienne one or two T's? One T, two N's. Philippe Etienne. One T, two N's. Usually. Who is it? ETIENNE KILLED ME Who? The businessman! - The businessman? - Damn! You express yourself poorly. Who is the businessman? I'll tell you. He's American. And his names is Johnson's. Michael Johnson, Johansson. - Michael Johansson. - Right. Half American. Swedish on his mom's side. Born in Michigan, studied in the Morbihan. Based in Paris now. Speaks French like youze and me. He speaks bilingual. Lots of linguals, in fact. He has big factories in Ohio, all over. He came to see me. He approached. He opened up, so I told him about my Double-Spouters. Honey, he started shouting. "Amazing! incredible!" He hugged me, a real American bear hug! He was a madman! He was saying: He adores my teapots! Says it's a brilliant idea. Great for the Middle East. He didn't find it brilliant, no way. Liar! Know what surprised me most? He wants me to advise him. I swear, he said: He even said: "I need new eyes on the world." I understand, he needs new blood. You're packing? He wants me 24/7. Always at his side. Where's the Ralph Lauren I got in Turkey? The colored striped one? Here it is. Why take your nicest shirt? Honey. What is it? Why the tears? Who's the bitch? Why are you lying? You're a cheat! I'm not cheating. There is no bitch! I'll be right back. What, Ricky? Sami, everyone says I missed the round of gyros. I wasn't there! It's not fair. - Go buy some gyros, Mbappe. - Sami, thanks! - Where were we? - At "Who's the bitch?" Yeah, who is she? There's no bitch. No bitch! Stop crying, baby. There's no bitch. I didn't cheat on you since 3rd grade, not once! I'm 8 months pregnant, and you cheat! Stop that now. I love only you. There is only you. Look. - I can't see. - Look. 10,000 euros? Is that cheating? What's your scam? There is no scam, baby, it's clean! Ricky, you're pissing me off. - You won 10,000? - Let's see! Show us. There's no check! What do you do for this? What do I do? I do nothing. The truth is, I can't say. - I signed a disagreement. - What? - Meaning? - It prevents me from talking. - I hope you don't get in trouble. - Please! - Do I ever get you in trouble? - Yes. Every day- But now there's a man who believes in me. I have a car and a driver. Look! No, there. Henri! Open the door, please? Can you shut it? Hello, ma'am. Hello. Henri works for me. Sabri! Open the door, please? Go fuck yourself! He doesn't work for me. Honey... At first, I just have to work for him nonstop. And you just have to trust me. Bad days are over, breathe easy. You can finally have fun and relax. You'll have... 14,000 euros a week to spend. - For real? - For real, of course for real. This first check is for you. I want you to spend it all, okay? Make yourself happy. Buy everything you don't need. Etienne, again and again Look at your Rolex, it's Revolution Time He's here, guys! Bastard! We'll kick your ass! Wait, it's Sami. Stop, it's Sami. We almost kicked your ass. - Mistook you for the boss! - I wish. Alice made sandwiches. Try the Catalan ones! What's the car story? That's Henri, he's a... Are you holding up? A limo? - How's Shrek? - Fine, Sami. Is working nights hard? Not too bad. I'm heading there. - Now? - Night guard at noon? You got crazy hours! Crazy, cray I got. Alice! See you soon, honey. We're fighting for you. Fuck the big bosses! Fuck the big bosses! Down with management! To the Chéteau, Henri. Tahiti vanilla milk shakes. - I don't understand your language. - Yeah, right. What you doing? Checking the comments on my last video. Show me. "Seriously boring." "You suck." "Write me a check instead." Don't read this crap. They all insult you like that? You have real live friends? The super-rich have no friends. You never know why people are with you. Do you have friends at school? Not in mine. Billionaire's boarding school in Switzerland. Switzerland? - When do you go back? - Ten days. Ten days? What did you think? Nothing. When we were playing you said... You seemed to speak in years, that we'd be together at least for months. 10 days is... See? You're here for the money too. Can you drink in silence? Silence, I said! I see why you have no friends. You're a drag. No fun, not nice. Not cool. You never laugh. They're right, you're a pain. Entertain me. Entertain you? Entertain me. Do what you're paid for. What should I do? Play dog. - Huh? - Play dog. Bark. Bark! Are you serious? I get on all fours and do this? You want that? You want me to be a dog? What is this? Who are these psychos? Why are you following me? Are you a mall cop? What am I gonna steal? A pine tree? Ferns? Your grandma? Minister, no mushrooms. Builder, no gluten. No, the PM is gluten-intolerant and the construction magnate hates mushrooms. The kid leaves in 10 days? Yes. I hadn't understood that. I thought the contract was longer. I made no follow-up plans. I'll have my job at the store? The toy store? I'm not laughing, Colonel Sanders. This is about my life. Think I like being here? Babysitting a rich brat who treats people like dogs? No friends, tons of haters. Everyone despises him. Why is that? Because he's despicable! It's unimaginable. He's not like us. He was raised by Macintosh. He runs on little bastard software! The kid's a monster! Mary Poppins! - No, it's beyond me! - Put it on or you're fired. I swear, never in my whole existence, would I wear that. 20,000 euros. 20,000 euros. What you make in 10 more days, right? So do your job. What the hell is this? A KKK meeting in Sologne? Alexandre... We're coming. Mr. Minister, meet my son Alexandre. - And his... - My bunny. I'm not his bunny. I'm his toy, that's all. It's for play. Are we going? We're off. Don't stray. - Rum - Why'? Alexandre, stop that! - What the hell? - Run! Stop your son! Run! Stop that right now! Apollo! Zeus! Gunther!

I sleep with my head turned. What's that TV? Sami. It's for the baby. That's for the baby? Personal initiative for the kid's education. Put it at baby-level. Honey. - Everything's ready. - Great. Say: "Thank you, Daddy." I paid off Az and the back rent. And look. It closes. Nono wanted to buy you something. - Killer TV, right? - Yeah, killer. You spent all the... With all the layoffs, I put the rest into a solidarity fund. Solidarity fund? They're closing the company. We can't give in. All my coworkers are struggling. I figured our debts could wait. What's wrong? Just a little contraction. Contraction of what? Those assholes fired everyone. Everyone including you? Yeah, they're closing. They're closing... We'd be in deep shit without your job. Very deep shit. You get a dream job and I lose mine. A miracle. It's wild. See? He came back. They always come back. What do we play now? - Go away. - Where's my bed? I won't play with you anymore. - Where's my bed? - Go away! I said go! What do we play? Why are you still here? I said to leave. Go out. I'm taking a bath. Take your time. I'll wait here.

Since science can also be fun, next time, we'll discuss these floating space bubbles that look like giant swimming pools. Cool, huh? So long, friends. I almost forgot! If you had fun, click on "subscribe" or "like". Shut off. Gunther? I'm glad you get along with this gentleman. I'll prepare him a room. No, he stays here. No, he changes rooms. No, he stays here. You're lucky I'm understanding. Rm lucky? Yeah, right. I'm lucky. You're here? What are you doing? I looked all over. I'm Philippe Etienne on his terrace. My father never comes here. Come. Calm down. Look how beautiful this is. You're crazy! It's stunning. What a vast view. The forest is all yours. I see underwear hung to dry. This... it's a first for me. Whatever. Come on, move. Whatever? Come back, Emmanuel Macron. This garden, the flowers, the lawn! These madeleines! You have servants! A big red cat! Enjoy it! If you don't enjoy today, heaven will bore you. You realize how lucky you are? Kiddo! Alexandre! Alex! Alexandre! Let go! Not so fast. This treehouse is unbelievable. I prefer this to your room. Wanna sleep here tonight? Room for only one person. We can easily put 40 people here. You okay? What's wrong? No need to act tough. You're allowed to be sad. When Mom got sick, the doctors said they couldn't do a thing. But Dad would listen to no one. As usual. He searched... until he found a miracle treatment in Stockholm. Mom didn't want to go. She wanted to be left in peace. If she weren't the wife of Philippe Etienne, I'd have spent the end of her life with her. The treatment could have worked. I miss her. Ever read The Baron in the Trees'? No. A manga? No, it's not a manga. One of 276 books I read as a parking lot attendant. I was so bored, I read a ton. There were no cars. It's the story of a rich kid, like you. He gets in a fight with his dad, just like you. Know what he does? He climbs a tree. Guess like who. Like me? And? And from that moment on, he never sets foot on the ground. No more ground. The guy lives in trees. He goes from branch to branch, because he's light. From forest to forest. From orchard to orchard. Know what an orchard is? And he explores the whole world. And he has extraordinary adventures. In the name of Father, Son and Wholly Toast, I slay you! I destroy you! Hello, my name is Miguel. I came to kill the queen. Hello, child. Countess of Bouillabaisse, my respects. Surrender, pirate! I'll slice you in two! Listen, little Chopper, I've battled the waves on the seven seas... Help! A big bear! Now the storm rages! In the tumultuous waves of the Pacific! Off the coast, not far from Venezuela! It's blowing in every direction! Everyone is scared, shouting. And then Stinkerbell arrived. She asketh: "Why do you do it?" And evil Rachida changed her head and told her... Honey, are you asleep? Working on tomorrow's demonstration. - Still pregnant? - What? You still have our child? I have him all right. - He's there? - Yes. Tell him I'm starting to like him a lot. And... and... I love you, Alice. What did you smoke? Nothing, what do you mean? Nothing. You never say you love me. I see it, but you never say it. That's a mistake, a huge mistake. Now I'll say it more often. Every two weeks, minimum. Thanks for sharing this. Goodnight, Alice. Hello, sir. One second, Henri. Good morning. Morning. I like walking barefoot on grass. It tickles my feet. And it relaxes me. See? No. He slept in the treehouse? Yes. What an amazing treehouse. He's reading his "One Piece", and he'll come. While you're here, can I ask a question? You know Cosmopac? A wrap factory where my wife works. My wife, my cousins, my neighbors. Everyone in the projects. One of my subsidiaries. They are all being laid off. The whole neighborhood. It's a catastrophe. Yes, a dissolution procedure is underway. Dissolutions can't be dissolved? No. You can't do a thing? How is he? Fair. He's not in great shape. With all due respect, sir... what he needs is time with you. Be content amusing my son, without giving your opinion. Have a good day. Big soccer game tonight. He'd be happy if you came. I'm dining with the Japanese Prime Minister. The Chéteau incident has repercussions. They're upset. It could throw into question the Tokyo Green Mall. If you send a signal to the Japanese... The Americans made a counter-offer. They're in Tokyo. Sir? You'll dine with the Japanese at Ambroisie. They would appreciate if you go in person. Two billion dollars! Sir? The idea is to tell them tonight at dinner. Isn't it wiser to go to Tokyo to clinch the deal? He'll get him! Tackle him! Stop! Penalty! I was afraid of that! Why? - What kind of match is this? - Yeah! You brought bad luck! Forget it! It's a break point! I can't watch. Neither can I. 5th penalty kick in 4 games... He didn't kick? Yes, wonderful. Excuse us, sir. My fault. I invited them. Unmute it. Don't mind me. Yeah, yeah... Exactly. Good! Go on... We scored! We're the best! Incredible! Oh "W, a goal! Goal, goal! Yes, goal. Goal. Goal. Jesus, Mary and Josette! You like madeleines? Yes, no. It's not madeleines. It's more... They're very good madeleines. More better than others. Madeleines. The Tokyo Exchange opens shortly. Really? I didn't know they exchanged in Tokyo. Tonight was far from a smashing success. Your son was thrilled that you came. So many people didn't help. As far as soccer fans go, I'm not incredibly at ease. I swear, it was great when you came in and shouted "Yes, wonderful!" That was a nice moment. With all due respect, Mr. Etienne... you're a bit stiff. You must feel it. Right? You have to let go more, I think. No one can read your mind. How so? It's not criticism. For example, I'll ask a question. Show me your face if I said you won a million dollars. Good face. Very good. Now show me your face if I said you lost... a million dollars? It's wild. You make the same face. Try adding some nuances. How would you say "Hello" to someone you don't like? Hello. Now say it to someone you like. Hello. You have one face. 50 cars, 600 employees, but one expression. It's a problem. You need at least two or three. At least three. Because... Excuse me. Do you mind if I... In life, when you like people, you show it. You go up and say: "What's up, pal? How's the family, all well?" See, this is the problem. You're... You show no warmth. You're too uptight, Mr. Etienne. Even with your son, I saw it, when you tried giving him a hug, it wasn't... It wasn't... Let's do a little test. Take me in your arms. Let's try. You have to loosen up. Take me in your arms. There. This... You have to take me in your arms too. There. It has to be reciprocal. You must apply the same mechanics. Hold me tight. There... Give me a snuggle, a real one. Have you ever snuggled? Yes. This is a snuggle. And if you really like the person, you breathe him in. See what I mean? Breathe me in, Mr. Etienne. There. That's good. There. Good evening, Ana Maria. Goodnight, gentlemen. Goodnight, Mr. Cherif. Night, Mr. Etienne. Mom! Mom... Alexandre? You okay, kid? What's wrong? What's going on? You okay, Alex? Morning, sir. My dear Paul... How are you? Good? Your health? Sir, I'm not Paul. I'm Lucien. Because... I'm Paul. Good, good. Paul, how's the family? Your daughter, her appendicitis... it all ended well? I have a son. The appendicitis was Lucien. Thank you, sir, things are much better. It's been a year. Very well. Hello, Ana Maria! This is pretty. What's this? - Don't! - A harpsichord. Mr. Gunther, you mustn't! Who do you think you are? This is not your home! Anything goes? Out! You're fired! Get lost! What did I do? Why? What did I do? Beat it, bum! What did you think? You'd join the family? - What did I do? - Loser. I played the piano! Get lost! I was playing! You have no right. I do, I'm your father. Sorry you grew attached. He went too far. It was time for him to go. I hate you. Need a ride? In that? Scoot over! I'll drive you home. No! I'm going with you. You're a nut job. Bat-shit crazy! No way. They'll annihilate you. They hate your father. We have that in common. Come on, Sami. I'm not Gunther anymore? So your name is not Etienne today, understand? We're off! Thank you, Sami! He left his room by the balcony. I didn't expect it. He took the mini-car. For society to work, everyone must know his place. Incompetence is not knowing your place. Sir! It's been 10 years! Find him now. Léa! I'm fired? Is that it? Sorry, Milo. We're all his toys. Fuk the sistem Look, Mexican abs! What's that car? The Chicago Nulls! You won the lottery? I played your birthdate! Hope you crash! My Couch! I'm sorry. Harmonie, I'm sorry. - You didn't even have priority! - Come on! It was an accident. Wanna be my childhood friend? - If you want. - I do. Can I drive, please! Sure, I'll show you how it works. Don't leave the projects! Leave them. Sami, so it's true? You're loaded now? Everyone's talking crap! He had a car made for his size! That chair isn't for yours. This is the baby's room. All this. We have a spaceball too. Like yours. Shit! I'll help you, ma'am! Thanks a lot. It's heavy, don't. I'm Alice. I hope my baby has your manners. With a dad like me, impossible! How are you? Who's he? My boss' son. Hi, I'm Alex. We'll get going- Excuse me, Sami, not to bother you... Wouldn't it be interesting for the baby to invest a sum of money in my real estate project? Tea? Got pine nuts? No pine nuts. Believe me, it's exceptional. This is my invention. Three glasses. Not bad, right? Striking serves no purpose at all. - Sure it serves a purpose. - What purpose? To be noticed. Our lives are on the line. You can't close factories like in Monopoly! Fucking Etienne! Piece of shit Etienne! - Dirty dog Etienne! - Flea-ridden Etienne! There's a child here. Sorry- Sorry, we're emotional. Who's on the phone? It's nice of you to come here. - See Sami often? - All the time. 26 missed calls What exactly is his job? Exactly? To take you home. Come on! I told you about my clause. You can tell us now. I already explained. Bye, everyone! Bye, everyone! Yo, Habib! My tracts! It's boiling hot! It doesn't work. There are two spouts, you need two glasses! Obviously. Are you stupid? I'll get the shuttle. It's leaking. That kid's car is worth a fortune. I can't find what's wrong. - I need to take him home. - It's the spark plug. What did you ever repair, a bike? Coming, Gaby? Alex, the car broke down. Cool! It's normal, it's out of gas. Out of gas! - You didn't check? - I'm not a gas station! Give it back! No, I won it. Give it back or you're dead! No, I won it! Give it back to him. Physically return it. What's that? Excuse me. I said to stop with that. - He was joking. - I won. - Give it back. - Tell him. - Hurry up! - I am. No, I don't want to. What's going on? - What's up? - He's fighting your brother. If they want to fight, let them. That's not a good idea. Destroy him. - That's too bad. - If he wastes him, I waste you. Run, Alex! Today was amazing. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Here... a gift. The Baron in the Trees Thanks, Sami. My tree is your tree, pal. - Bye, Alexandre. - Bye, guys! Bye! Give him the keys! Stop! Hands off! Alexandre, get inside. No! I don't want to leave. Alex... You belong with your father. Make the most of your life. I trust you to do something big. Not medium, something big. I don't want to leave with them. I want to stay with you! Let go of me! Let go! I hate all of you! Gunther! Gunther! What's this bullshit? You're a YouTube star! Know what? I'll call you Gunther. Come, Gunther. Milo shot that! Why did he post that? Coming? Come, Gunther. You're in deep shit. Bark. You bet. Philippe Etienne! Fuck! You sold yourself as a toy? We're getting fired and you wipe his kid's ass? The kid has nothing to do with it. Sicko! You're a dangerous person! It's easy to criticize, but you liked the money. I don't give a fuck about the money. Not if it's to lie and shame me. You shamed us all. I shamed you all? Who did I shame? Who did I shame in the projects? Did I shame anyone here? No one in the building? All I did was find a job. Wait, what? A job? You call this a job? Great! My toy! I can't trust you anymore. You've lied to me from day one. I don't know you. I swear, I... I don't admire you anymore. I don't need a toy like you for my child. Get out of my life. Alice, please. Those videos are fake. I never played dog. Get out, Gunther. Sami, before you leave, can you get me a Pepsi Max from the fridge? You're a dear. HEY, ! - A dog for the rich? - Coward. You okay, Sami? Did the billionaire give you to his son as a toy? Can you tell us how you were manipulated by Philippe Etienne? The video, now seen over 2 million times, spread like wildfire among union workers, strikers, and France's outcasts. Arielle Daher reports. We're near the Sami's projects with his comrades. It's always the same thing. They use us then throw us away. It's not normal. My mother works here. My husband too. What'll happen to us? Where is Mr. Etienne? Give us back our dignity! By being bought as a toy, Sami became the incarnation of man's defeat by the capitalist system. No to capitalism! Down with management! Sami Cherif remains impossible to find. Come show yourself. This is my new toy. Handsome, right? I adore him. Bark! Family, friends, Double-Spout Sami here. Leave a message, I'll call you back. Family, friends, Double-Spout Sami here. Leave a message... Where are you? Alexandre! I go to Japan tomorrow. Come along. You really want me to come? Yes. Then I want a present. We reached an agreement with my so... with... my board of directors, and we decided to save Cosmopac. I commit myself to keeping your jobs. Not that dumb, boss! We have to go now. Since this seems to suit you all, I'll be going. Excuse me! This doesn't suit me at all. And Sami? No one asks where or how he is? We spit in his face but we're no better! You mention cowards? We're cowards! Where is everyone who said "Motherfucker Etienne"? You stop! Traitor! You stab him in the back to get on TV. Disgusting! Calm down. Sami stabbed himself, sorry. Why did he go in that box? Every single one of you would have gone in the box for a quarter of the price! Every single one! Am I right or... Don't get so worked up. Get out of my way! Leave me alone. - Let us help. - Beat it. Are you well? - We'll help her. - I don't need anyone! Go ahead, sir. You thought buying that factory would mend things? Emotions and business don't mix. I won't become a robot like you. To hell with your rules. Not mine. They belong to a system we can't change. Who if not you can change them? 8 billion people are fighting for money, my son. The Etienne Group makes a lot. But we employ hundreds of thousands. One day you'll run it. You'll want to leave it to your son. For that, you'll need to toughen up and to accept the rules I've always followed. What for, if I'm not happy? Why be France's richest man, if your money couldn't even save Mom? You're right. I should have left her home with you. With us. I'll never forgive myself. Sami will miss his baby's birth. I won't forgive myself either. Where did you hide your toy? Sir! The plane is waiting. I do as I please. Sami! Telephone! It's Mr. Alexandre! It's in the basket. If I were you, I'd answer! It's urgent! Thanks, Dad. This way, it's in here. It's the Etienne boy. As union leader, I can start a strike. But I can also be Mr. Etienne's eye. - Your name? - Moussa. Births always make me emotional. A hors d'œuvre? Who pays your overtime? Overtime? We work nonstop. Is this meat couscoussed? - It's a secret. - Come meet our chef. I'm happy to be here with you. Me too. Everything I did was for you. Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting. Since Sami will be on paternity leave, need a new toy? No thank you, that's very kind. It's a girl! You performed a miracle, honey. What's her name? No idea yet. If it was a boy, I had Gunther. Call her Madeleine. That's nice. - Great idea. - Nonsense, her name is Sofia. Her name is Sofia. Like your mother? Nice. May I? My princess! Come kiss her, losers. Gently. Sami, can I be her godfather? Yeah. Here. I'd love that. - Hi, Sofia. - You're loaded! You Okay? Come. Let's take a walk. Have a seat. Take off your shoes. Your socks too. You know, Dad, if ever I take your place, I won't do anything like you. You're Alexandre Etienne, you do as you please. My way? Your way. Coming? It tickles. Yes. I want to launch a start-up. If you want... In what? Teapots. Double-spout teapots. THE NEW TOY Make the most of your life. I trust you to do something big. Not medium, something big. Subtitles: Andrew Litvac Subtitling: HIVENTY
