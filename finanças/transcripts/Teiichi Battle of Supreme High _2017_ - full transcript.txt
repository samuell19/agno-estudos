"Showa Era Japan" "Politics is war without bloodshed." My favorite quote by Mao Tse Tung. In a landslide victory, Representative Katsuya Tabuse has won a seat in the Lower House election. My dream is to become the prime minister of Japan. Prime minister's salary: 40 million yen. Donations: 200 million yen. In addition, there's the 1 to 3 billion yen "Proprietary Fund"... A secret discretionary fund used by politicians for "pocket money." It's the ultimate dream job. How do I become prime minister? "Kaitei High School Entrance Ceremony" Congratulations, incoming students! I am your student body president. Kaitei was established in 1 891 as an elite naval training academy which was later renamed Kaitei High School, an incubator for future politicians and bureaucrats. I have to become student body president of Kaitei High School, then a member of the political faction made up of past presidents. This is the path to the prime minister's office, with the fringe benefit of automatic admission to Tokyo University. We will provide you with gentle, yet strict guidance! Everyone wants to become president. All men are ambitious. But I reject failure. Applause! Stop! Now, representing the incoming class, with the highest score on the school entrance exam, and president of Kaitei Middle School, from freshman class 1, seat 1, Teiichi Akaba! Here! Go, Teiichi. Step by step, I will rise to the post of student body president. And eventually, become prime minister so I can create... ...my own empire! Based on the manga by Usamaru Furuya TEIICHI - BATTLE OF SUPERME HIGH Masaki Suda as Teiichi Akaba Shuhei Nomura as Kikuma Togo Ryoma Takeuchi as Dan Otaka Shotaro Mamiya as Roland Himuro Jun Shison as Komei Sakakibara Yudai Chiba as Okuto Morizono Mei Nagano as Mimiko Shiratori Kotaro Yoshida as Josuke Akaba Directed by Akira Nagai "Teiichi Akaba, 4th grade, Bunmei Elementary School" My father, Josuke Akaba, currently Undersecretary of Trade, is an alumnus of Kaitei High School. My mother, Sakurako, was a concert pianist. I was the born into an elite family with tremendous expectations. My father lost in Kaitei High School's presidential election to his arch rival, Usaburo Togo. Togo was inducted into the elite President's Circle and is now Minister of Trade. My father wanted me to live out his dream. But ironically, I inherited my mother's genes. I swept the piano competition circuit, causing Usaburo Togo's son Kikuma and his sidekick Nishizo Nezu to mercilessly taunt me. - Nipple boy! - Ow! "Kikuma Togo, 4th grade," Playing piano again, sissy? "Bunmei Elementary School" Playing piano again, sissy? Give it back! Act like a man and make me! You'll pay for this! "Mimiko Shiratori, 4th grade," I'll kick your ass next time! "Bunmei Elementary School" I'll kick your ass next time! Her name is Mimiko Shiratori. Why don't you fight back? I hate confrontation. Well, I like you. You're sweet, Teiichi. Teiichi! Playing the piano again?! You're home, Father. I'm not saying don't play, but there's so much more to learn! You're scaring him, dear. What a sissy. That's why Togo's son always bullies you. Teiichi has good grades. It takes more than good grades to become president of Kaitei! I don't want to be president. Idiot! Becoming student body president is the path to becoming a politician that could shape national policy! To creating your own empire! Could any man dream for more? My own...empire? Sakurako, your damned piano turned your son into a sissy! He's grown up to be a kind person. This calls for waterfall training! Waterfall?! To shock some sense into you! Please, dear. Why does my piano playing create such friction? All I ever wanted to do was play. Teiichi! - Teiichi! - Brother! I'll go train at the waterfall. Teiichi. That was when a switch turned on inside me. I vowed to create my own empire and do whatever it takes. "Fair and square" doesn't exist in Teiichi's vocabulary. "Akaba Residence" Your dinner. Thank you. Welcome home, Father. How was school? Unremarkable. My speech went smoothly. Become homeroom representative. With your grades, it should be automatic but I'll increase our donation, just in case. It's only his first day. I hope you'll make some friends, Teiichi. Mother, I didn't get into Kaitei to make friends. Well said. Just don't lose to Kikuma Togo, no matter what! Yes, Father. How's Hanazono Girls School? Boring. Everyone's a snob. They say things like, "Good day." It's not your style. You're so mean. Anyways, why the makeshift phone? Consorting with girls is against school policy. A political scandal is the kiss of death. No one can tap this phone. You're so cautious. So how was school? There's a pleasant level of tension. It's the first step towards my dream. Are you still playing piano? No. That's a shame! You could be a concert pianist. I'd love to hear you play. Mimiko... There comes a time when a man has to fight for his life. For some, it's college entrance exams. For others, it's for a job. For me, it's now! Piano can wait. I'll be rooting for you. Thanks. I love you. Me, too. Stand! Bow! Sit! A homeroom representative must embody exemplary conduct. A president must first become a homeroom representative and a member of the student council. We've made our selection. Your representative is... Teiichi Akaba! I knew it. Yes. I'm honored, Mr. Kawamata. I will do my best to advance the interests of this class. Choose a Vice Rep by tomorrow. I already have. Vice Representative Komei Sakakibara! I humbly accept. Teiichi, I need to pee. I'll go with you. They're really close. We're ready, Mr. Kawamata. Yes, Principal. Class 1 Rep: Teiichi Akaba. Donation: 6 million yen. Vice Rep: Komei Sakakibara. Donation: 1 million yen. They were president and V.P. in middle school. Class 2 Rep: Kikuma Togo. Donation: 5 million yen. Vice Rep: Nishizo Nezu. Donation: 1 million yen. So it's Kikuma and Nishizo in class 2. But everyone's saying you're a shoo-in for president. It helps to have a genius like you who can engineer a wiretap like this. So you want to be president to avenge your father's defeat to mine? Teiichi, I'll be the next president. You can relive your father's humiliation. Kikuma, don't say that. Komei, I believe in you. You should abandon this loser and join my faction. No. You have bad breath. Let's go, Komei. Running away? I'm not fighting anyone. This election is my own personal battle. Goody-two-shoes. That's what I hate about you! But I know you're rotten on the inside. You reek of evil. He reeks, Nishizo! At least my breath doesn't reek, like yours. Don't get carried away, nipple boy. Want to be bullied again? Look, your legs are shaking. Sorry! You okay? Thank you. You gave the speech at the ceremony. Teiichi Akaba, Representative, Class 1. I'm Komei Sakakibara. I see. I'm Dan Otaka, Class 6 Rep. Class 6? I thought Sasaki was Class Rep. He's my Vice Rep. For some reason, they selected a transfer student. You transferred in? Wow! That's not easy. Hey, wait! You ignore me after hitting me with a ball? Your breath stinks. What the hell? What's up, Dan? Nothing. What's your name again? Kikuma Togo, Class 2 Rep. Don't forget it! Sorry I hit you, Kikuma. Come on, let's play! He's like a hero in a girls' manga. Dan's a nice guy. He's popular, too. Whoa! Don't be fooled! All homeroom reps are rivals. Sorry. Eat my bugger! Ew! That's gross! I'm going that way. See you, Dan! See you! Teiichi and Komei, right? You need something? He found us! Well... As fellow homeroom reps, I wanted to get to know you better. I see. Come over, then. A little further...Here we are! - Here. - Here? I'm home! - I'll beat you up, Teiichi! - Stop it. Dan... Dan! I'm making dinner, so watch the kiddies, will ya? Let's eat! Go for it. Go ahead. It's good! It is good. Try it, Teiichi! It's delicious. I'm full. - Is it good, Suzu? - Yeah! Yummy! Dan, where are your parents? My dad died and my mom works. Sorry, but how did you get into private school? My plan was to work, but Kaitei offered me a scholarship. Kaitei's feeder school system is extremely hard to get into. It takes a nearly perfect score to get a scholarship. You must be a genius. He's No.1 in everything! - I doubt that. - Teiichi. You're a funny guy. Why don't you try a bite? Okay. A little. It's good... Delicious! The fried chicken's good, too. It's good. Ew! Sorry. He's admirable. Your friend, Dan. Admirable? He may not seem ambitious, but I bet he's extremely calculating. Maybe some people just aren't ambitious. Only on the surface. Teiichi. You've changed. I haven't changed! I've grown stronger! My mom's calling me. See you. Teiichi stands for No.1! "Entrance Exam for Transfer Students" A copy of the test for transfer students? I'd like to take the test myself. No. Dan Otaka's test scores are proprietary. Don't compete with him. I want to see who's No.1! Mr. Kawamata, my father has connections in the Ministry of Culture. So? You're a fan of the author of "Anne of Green Gables." He'll be promoting an exhibition of her work in Japan. How did you know I love "Anne of Green Gables" "Anne of Green Gables"? Komei is an excellent researcher. But still... Manuscripts penned by Montgomery... Quilts sewn by Montgomery herself... Could I actually...see them? Test 1 : Math. Begin! Boolean function?! I never learned this in school! Verify the expression of function F as follows. 00 or 1? What are variables AB? Test 2: English! Entrance exam for transfer students? Father. So Togo isn't your only rival... Okay, let's do it. First, Japanese. Japanese... Japanese. Dan Otaka... 1 00 points! Teiichi Akaba, 1 00 points! We're even. He's good! - Math! - Math! Dan Otaka, 96 points! Teiichi Akaba, 95 points! 1 point short... Don't panic! Chin up! It's just 1 point! Yes. - English! - English! Dan Otaka, 95 points! Teiichi Akaba, 96 points! We're tied! You can do it! I'm not afraid of Dan Otaka! Have no fear! You're No.1! - Sociology! - Sociology! Dan Otaka, 98 points! Teiichi Akaba...95! 3 points...is a huge gap. What's wrong? 3 points. Are you ready to admit defeat? The word "defeat" doesn't exist in Teiichi's vocabulary! Lastly, science! Science! - Science! - Science! Dan Otaka! 95 points! Teiichi Akaba... 1 00 points! Thank goodness! My empire is safe! Dan Otaka, 484 points total. Teiichi Akaba, 486 points total. It's not official, but you won by 2 points! Teiichi, how does it feel to win? I... ...can only live by winning! I never want to lose like a dog! Idiot! You are a dog. Become a dog! A winning dog! Winning dog... Stand! Bow! Sit! Each freshman rep will present his resolution. Class 1, Teiichi Akaba. Here! I'm deeply honored to be a member of the student council. But... I have no intention of promoting myself at this time. From this day forward, I will promote my agenda wholly through actions. I humbly ask for your guidance and support! Class 2, Kikuma Togo. Here! My strength lies in intelligence gathering. I will gather intel for you with the persistence of a snapping turtle. I will be your arms and legs. I will not fail you. My name is Kikuma Togo. He's appealing his usefulness. Dammit. Lastly, Class 6, Dan Otaka. Yo. I don't have a resolution like these other guys. My goal is to make school fun. I'll do my best. Thanks. He's a small fry. I outscored him on the test. The Montgomery ploy worked? I got a copy of his test. Thanks to your brilliant strategy. The Treasurer will report on the budget for club activities. Please refer to your handouts. First, the budget requests. This year's... Kaitei High School has a unique presidential election process. 60 council members comprised of class reps elect the president. The current president has the authority to pick 3 candidates for the next president from the 6 junior homeroom reps. Komei. Yes? The surest way of becoming president... ...is to align yourself with the most likely candidate for president. These 3 are the most likely. First, Shota Honda from class 4. A typical family of politicians. Impeccable pedigree. His family is so prominent, he's sure to attract some votes. But he's too quiet, and he messed up the lighting in last year's school festival. Have a nice day. Second, Okuto Morizono, class 5. A genius at the top of his class since middle school. A chess master who can read 1,000 moves ahead. I lost! He's also President Doyama's childhood friend and advises him on student council operations. He's a prime candidate! But there's someone even more qualified. I know. Roland Himuro, class 6. So he's from Kaitei. What? You scared? They really stood out in middle school. What's wrong, huh? - Ready, Koma? - Yeah. Mr. Himuro from Kaitei taught us a lesson. You're trash. We're meant to rise to the top. A superhero who avenges any Kaitei student who's been harassed by thugs. Himuro was the No.1 contributor to President Doyama's campaign in his election. Whose dog shall I be? The answer is clear! Woof! Excuse me! Akaba isn't paying attention. Teiichi Akaba! Repeat what I just said! Oops! Ha! Yes! In addition to each club's budget, we will establish a priority quota to promote equality and fairness. Each club should review the process and make their requests accordingly. By the way, there is a misprint in the total appropriations figure. I believe it should be 26,61 9,200 yen and not 26,620,200 yen, an increase of 6.74% over last year. Whoa! He's good. That's the end of the report. Let's move on to student council operations. President Doyama, I'd like to run the general meeting. Anyone else? It's all yours. Thank you. Freshmen, the general meeting is the stage on which President Doyama announces and approves the budgets for the various clubs at our school. It's also a sacred ritual and your first job as freshmen representatives. Let me remind you. Failure in any form is unacceptable! The penalty for failure is imaginary "hara-kiri." Imaginary hara-kiri? The offender will be considered dead, his future finished. Himuro Senpai! What is it? I heard that last year, someone dropped the school flag on stage and embarrassed the president. Yes. He was stripped of his post and banned by the council. But, he insisted on his innocence and claimed he was set up. Morizono, who are you trying to blame? No one. Himuro Senpai! It's Teiichi Akaba. May I carry the school flag? I'd like to be of assistance. That weasel! Akaba! Are you trying to promote yourself? Forgive me! Ha! But, I like aggressiveness. You may bear the flag. It's an honor! Well done, Teiichi. You even caught a misprint. Yeah. Himuro Senpai, Koma Senpai, Kikuma Togo, at your service. What did he hand them? Personal information on the freshman class? With personalities and weaknesses. Kikuma could be useful. Yeah. And the freshman representative Teiichi Akaba looked me in the eyes. His eyes said, "I'll be your dog." How endearing. And Dan Otaka, class 6. He's popular with the freshmen. We need him, too. In any case, they all adore me. Kikuma has his eyes on Himuro Senpai, too. Is it so important to work for Himuro Senpai? My future depends on who I align myself with. Just like the political war of 1 970... That's over my head. Let's go out sometime. Yeah. But isn't it great? Himuro Senpai is letting me carry the school flag as a freshman! I'm sure you know the school flag is the pride of Kaitei. I don't. You're not even listening to me. That's not true. I have to lay the groundwork now. Akaba's son is carrying the school flag? I'm sorry, Father! But I'm in charge of lighting. Bearing the school flag is the pride of Kaitei! You're such an idiot. Who did you take after? The Akabas are the toilet paper stuck to my butt hairs! You lost to toilet paper! I will work diligently to make Teiichi commit imaginary hara-kiri in public. Good. "General Student Body Meeting" Please take your seats. Dan, watch the volume of the music. Dim the lights slowly. We begin in 3 minutes. Yes, Himuro Senpai! The school flag weighs 20 kg. It must be lowered in time with the music as President Doyama approaches the podium. Nishizo. I got it. Teiichi, ready? As I'll ever be, Himuro Senpai! Student Body President, Keigo Doyama! Applause! Stop! The school song! Dan, the music! "From the" "ancient gods..." "The deep seas..." Good, Teiichi. Don't stop. "The light that shines" "on the seven seas" "We are the warriors" "We are the light" "Kaitei! Kaitei!" "Brilliant light" "Kaitei High School!" "Kaitei High School!" The general meeting of the student body will begin! Applause! Stop! Yes! That was perfect, Teiichi. Now we wait for the interim report to appear on the screen. - Stand by until then. - Yes! Good job, Teiichi. First, the agenda. I will announce the items up for discussion. Nishizo... If over 2/3 of the students oppose the proposal, the council members will reconsider the matter. Now, the budget proposals for club activities. This year's club activities are as follows. The flag... Can you hear me? Don't use the mic for personal conversation. Only Himuro and I give instructions! I'm sorry. "Someone's messing with the flag." Someone's messing with the flag? Nishizo! What are you doing? Wait! You're so tenacious. Stay away. Stay away! Stop it...stop! What would happen if you dropped the flag now? Stop! Stop! Hey, nipple boy! You're still hanging on. How about this? Tickle, tickle! Is there an itch you'd like me to scratch? No! It'll be over soon. Are you serious? Dear god, give him strength. If I fall, you'll be a criminal! I'll say I was trying to help! Stop it! I can't lose to you. You rotten... But I'm still Kikuma! Crap! You're stronger than I thought! I'll make you suffer, just like... What are you doing? Kikuma, you dirty dog. Crap! Dan! Dan! Are you okay? This will conclude the general student body meeting! Applause! 3... 4... Good job, everyone. President Doyama was delighted. Teiichi, your timing with the flag was impeccable. Well done. Thank you. Unlike the two of you, who abandoned your posts. I'm sorry, I... Sorry! I was taking a leak. Seems I can't count on you. I'm sorry! Move! Dan, Komei, thanks. Thank goodness. Your warning saved me. We're in sync, even if we're apart. Teiichi, your arms are rock hard! Get a room, guys. I want to call Kikuma out on it, but if you don't want me to... You were punished because of me. He didn't have to get that mad. You want to be student body president that badly? Is it wrong? No, it's fine but Kaitei's student council is crazier than I thought. I owe you big time, Dan. - You don't owe me. - Yes I do. And I will repay you. I have to go to work. See ya. See ya. "Six months later" Six months later, the candidates for president were announced. The 3 candidates for the next student body president are... Shota Honda. Yes. Okuto Morizono. Yes. And Roland Himuro. Yes. Let's hear Shota Honda's manifesto. Yes. Um...I... As a Kaitei... What was it? I'm sorry. My mind went blank. Next, Okuto Morizono. Yes. I... ...would like to create a system that rewards effort. Namely, a merit based system. Merit based? Whether club activities are cultural or athletic, funds should be appropriated to clubs with the highest achievements. But regardless of their track record, I'd like to evaluate the freshmen and establish a budget based on "future potential." Sounds good. So weaker clubs can recruit strong freshmen to increase their budget. And... I want to abolish the rule that the president must be nominated. The entire student body should vote. What?! So anyone can run for president. Abolish factions? Totally impractical! Lastly, Roland Himuro. The body is a temple! Until now, we've distributed the budget evenly amongst all clubs, but I pledge to dramatically increase the athletic clubs' budgets next year! Kaitei High School is known for its academics. Let's make it known for athletics as well! And I strongly oppose Morizono's totally democratic model! It may sound good, but absolute democracy is a recipe for chaos, which will jeopardize our school's history and tradition! It would be reckless to radically change Kaitei in our generation. Bravo! Himuro! Himuro! Himuro! Himuro! Can I come over? Sure. Are you hungry? Are you sure? Hey, Dan. Why don't you join me in supporting Himuro Senpai? I'm not interested in politics. But you're into sports. You must agree with Himuro Senpai's manifesto. But he's doing it to get votes, right? I kind of agree with Morizono's proposal to treat everyone equally. To use a chess analogy, he's just a "pawn." But a pawn in enemy territory can pose a threat. Himuro is very calculating. I'll probably lose, unless things change. That's why I'm waiting. For an ally to come along and protect me. You want to be student body president, too? I think this whole thing is crazy. I agree. But shouts from the sidelines are never heard. We have to infiltrate enemy territory to change the tide. You're right. To be honest, I don't even want to be president. But I was nominated. And I hate to lose. Fighter's instincts? I'm just a guy. Please vote for Roland Himuro. The election has begun... The next student body president... This may be a game changer. But Himuro might win after all. It'll be interesting if Morizono wins. The polls are out. "Himuro surges ahead" According to the polls, Himuro has an overwhelming lead. Himuro! Himuro! What do you want? Minister... Togo. We're peers, but I'm still a Minister. Show some respect. Did you call me to aggravate me? Your protectionist policy favoring domestic automakers is facing opposition from all sides. I know. But it was a request from Prime Minister Tabuse. And... I know you're trying to promote U.S. auto manufacturers. I also know you've taken bribes from an auto executive named Redford. Watch your mouth! I don't give a damn what the prime minister said! His post will be mine anyhow! Even you should know who you should wag your tail for. How's the election going? Himuro Senpai is off to a good start. The school festival is coming up and I'm in charge of the opening ceremony. I have to succeed. I'm thinking about future votes. It was just one vote. Huh? I lost to Togo by one vote. But that vote changed my life! Don't forget that! Thank you for your advice! I'll lick Himuro Senpai's shoes if I have to! Himuro? Father, I'm in charge of the closing ceremony at the school festival. I'll contact a fireworks company that I know. Himuro Senpai will be pleased. Himuro? Yes. Roland Himuro, the leading candidate for student body president. Roland Himuro... "Kaitei School Festival" Now for the opening ceremony of Kaitei's school festival. And now! Kaitei High School festival's opening ceremony! Why me? Here's my strategy. The athletics clubs were happy to participate in the opening ceremony. We were all on the same stage, practicing together, sweating together, as one, cementing our bond. Are you okay? Come get your beef bowl! You really fired up the audience! Remember to vote for me. Teiichi, your opening ceremony was spectacular. Thank you! But to win over undecided voters... Why not promise them key posts in your cabinet? But there aren't enough posts to go around. Your aim is to win their votes. - So trick them? - No, not trick them. Make promises that are hard to actualize. That's prohibited. I'll do whatever it takes to get elected! You're not running. I'll do whatever it takes... Don't fight. What's Dan Otaka up to? Dan? What about Dan? I could use a popular guy like him. Himuro, Kikuma gave us some intel. I went to Dan's house. I can provide even better information. Good job. You're so good! Dan. Himuro Senpai. Have a minute? Yes. What is it? I hear you've assumed your late father's debts. Poor guy. Your mother is working day and night to pay it off. That's why you have to take care of your siblings. I have an idea. My father's company set up a foundation to fight poverty. If you like, I can ask him to apply for a subsidy... In exchange for my vote? What's the problem? It's easy. Dan, it's a good idea. Himuro Senpai will be the next president. Let's support him together. And when I succeed him, I'll make you V.P. You'd be guaranteed a spot in a good private college. My vote isn't for sale. And I'll get into college on my own merits. That's very noble of you. But you're just blinded by self-righteousness. If you're serious, you're a fool! Fine, I'm a fool then. Too bad. When I become president, you won't even be able to... Teiichi, I thought you were my friend. Was I wrong? Friend? I never thought of you as my friend. - Teiichi... - Think about it, Dan. Just writing down my name will help your poor mom out. Do it for her. I'm a weak human being. To be honest, I wavered a bit. I hit you so I could never go back. I've decided to support Morizono for president! I'll never vote for a backroom dealer like you. Hey, I'll kill you! Try it! I'll take you on! Everyone's watching. Hit him and it's over. This is my chance. Excuse me, Himuro Senpai. I'm in a crappy mood. Get out! Dan got mad because Teiichi provoked him. That may be true. Both he and his father are conspiring against you. What do you mean? Your father is the president of a U.S. automaker. It's all my fault. I rubbed dirt all over Himuro Senpai's face. Teiichi. I did some research. And? Roland Himuro's real name is Roland Himuro Redford. His father Steve Redford, is the Japan president of HM, a leading U.S. automaker. He's my sworn enemy. My protectionist policy created huge losses for HM, who invested millions to dominate the Japan market. Redford had to take full responsibility. He must hate me. If Himuro Senpai ever finds out... Teiichi! I'll never forgive you. I'll use you up and spit you out. You'll be used and abused. It's the end. My dream is finished. Teiichi, why are you naked? If Himuro Senpai doesn't nominate me, I'm as good as dead! I have to become student body president! And prime minister... Or I'll have no reason to live! Then Teiichi, you have only one choice. What is it? Here's the wiretap recording. Teiichi! I'll never forgive you. I'll use you up and spit you out. That would be best. Good job, Kikuma. I'm counting on you. By the way, I've arranged fireworks for the closing ceremony. Spectacular! Come here and let me hug you. You'll be the next president... What will you do? I made my decision, Komei. I'm waging a war. Do you mean... Yes. I'll join the Morizono faction and destroy Himuro Senpai! "Okuto Morizono" So your plan is to rebel against Himuro and join my camp? It's your lucky day! With me on your side, you'll have a chance against Himuro. You have a plan? Komei! Excuse me. Come in. Hello... Honda. - Hello. - Yamabane, too? I stayed up all night to come up with this plan. I have a chance against Himuro if I align myself with Honda? Exactly...huh? Dan advised me to do that yesterday. He got there first. When did you think of this strategy? Yesterday... What hour, minute and second? That's not the point. In any case, I'd never trust someone who'd use Dan's personal situation in order to win. I'd take him in. At this rate, we're struggling to increase our voter base. I agree. Teiichi would be a huge ally. I'd rather support you than take away each other's votes. For better or worse, Teiichi is single-minded, and aggressive like a "knight" to use a chess analogy. Right? You'd speak up for me after what I did? I think of you as my friend. So it's cool. Dan... You'd support a "pawn" like me? I take that back! I apologize! Morizono, he really means it. I've never seen such humility. I'm joking. I forgive you. Let's fight together. Yes! Teiichi. "Farewell Letter" "Good-bye, Himuro Senpai. From: Teiichi Akaba" Never chase a deserter. Rather... Shoot him in the back! Himuro's faction is still ahead, but his strategist, Akaba, has deserted his camp. It will be a close battle. Honda conceded. The body is a temple! Let's democratize the election. I have 32 votes, more than a majority. But I need to win over the culture club and committee votes from Morizono. Let's pledge our lives to getting the remaining votes! Yes! "Himuro - 40, Morizono - 20" Why is the gap widening? That's funny... What tactics are they using? Ow! Morizono Senpai! Good. End in a supine position. You'll increase our budget? As long as you vote for Himuro. He'll greatly increase the thespian club budget next year, right, Himuro Senpai? Don't you want new costumes? Of course. But do you have the funds? We have a secret stash. Secret stash? Just between us, there's a pool of funds set aside for emergencies. Tamasaburo, think of this as a personal gift. For me? Himuro, you're going too far. Bribery is a political tool. I'm not talking to you. Koma, stay out of it. Secret stash... But isn't that bribery? This war is finally getting real. - Shall we expose them? - It's no use! I'm sure Kikuma is behind this. He doesn't leave tracks. Is there actually a "secret stash" to begin with? There's no such thing. It's all Kikuma's idea. Huh? What the hell? When I become president, I'll just increase the council budget to subsidize them. That will never be approved by the general committee. Where are you going to get all that money? Kikuma has that covered, too. I threatened our vendors that I'd terminate their contracts, and they coughed up kickbacks. What happened to you? Do you know what you're doing? It's too risky! Shut up! I have to win! Sorry, Koma. Hey. You've always been my ally. Remember when you were bullied and I stuck up for you? We're almost there. Come on, Koma. A bought vote is meaningless. It's only a number, not the will of the people. Who cares about their will? We need numbers! But whoever took the bribes won't feel good about it. Politics isn't about feeling good! You just don't get it. You need money? Don't do it. Money will get you into trouble. You don't know how brutal political warfare can be. But at this rate, we'll lose! If Morizono Senpai loses, I'm really finished! Teiichi... Remember the Shogitai? The former shogunate forces that lost the Boshin War. Why do you think the Shogitai lost the war? The new shogunate forces held a trump card. The "flag." Flag? They won with a flag? Right. They raised their flag first and showed the world that they were the victors. It turned the tide in their favor. Show them that Morizono is the victor and Himuro will look like the rebel. If you do that, the people will naturally turn towards Morizono. But whoever took the bribes won't feel good about it. I got it! "Himuro - 46, Morizono - 14" It looks like Himuro will be the next student body president. I wouldn't count on it. Himuro! You gave money to the thespian club! What about the athletics club? Quiet down, please. Okay, okay. Don't blow it out of proportion. "Broadcasting Room" Please play this song after school. Hey, Himuro. Where's my money? Calm down! Kikuma, this was your idea! Do something! What are they doing? "Mayim Mayim"! It's a last-ditch effort in a losing battle. - What's going on? - What is this? The circle's growing. A familiar folk song that we've known since childhood. They loved it. The circle grew bigger as if to extol Morizono Senpai at its center. But there were some who could not join the circle. Those who accepted bribes from Himuro. Beset by feelings of guilt, they could not join Morizono's circle. This surprise attack moved the entire student body. This was the Mayim Mayim Incident that went down in Kaitei history. This is a farce! We did nothing wrong! You want money, right? I'll bring some more tomorrow. So vote for me! What's with you? You're going to be V.P. because of me. You'll get into a good private college. You should thank me! That's a crappy thing to say. Don't piss me off. Who taught you how to fight off the bullies? I want to dance! The polls are out! Okay, ready? 30 - 30! We're tied! The Mayim Mayim worked! We're seen as the victors! Your strategy was amazing. I'm ready to lay down my life if you lose. Please don't die. Morizono and Himuro are tied? Please lend me your support! So you're losing to Akaba's son. You piece of shit. I'm sorry. That Akaba. Like father, like son. Fools! They'll pay. "Snapping Turtle Restaurant" What is this? A water chestnut. Does it taste good? It's not a matter of taste. It's about enjoying the season. I don't get it. Isn't this great? Eating snapping turtle in a private room. It would be scandalous if someone saw us together. Come on. Let's enjoy this date. Hey. Why do you have to fight so hard? Huh? What do you want to do as prime minister? Make my own empire. And then what? - Let's eat some turtle. - I'd love to, but I'd rather hear you play. Stop it! Don't talk about piano with the election coming up! My dream is about to come true! I'm leaving. Mimiko! One week to election day! Victory is near! Let's go cheer on the sports teams. Just a few more days. Right, Teiichi? Teiichi! A dove... Why are you lost in thought? Actually, Mimiko and I are on the rocks. Why are you so happy? What? Who's happy? I hope Himuro doesn't have something up his sleeve. Akaba! Your dad... Don't worry, Yume. No way. It must be a mistake! Investigators are searching the home of Undersecretary Akaba, accused of... Teiichi... Trade Undersecretary Josuke Akaba is under investigation for bribery. Investigators have asked Mr. Akaba to voluntarily accompany them to the... This is a disaster. I'm sorry. You said money would get me into trouble. Was that about you? That's not how it is. Believe me. I never accepted a bribe. I'm... being made into a scapegoat. Scapegoat? Redford and Togo opposed my policy which protected domestic automakers. Are you kidding me?! I don't know anything about that! Why does everyone just get in my way? I'm... ...done for sure this time. Teiichi... You told me to make my own empire. I didn't mean to get in your way. Lies! All lies! You've always stood in my way! I want to play the piano... Piano? Teiichi! Playing the piano again?! This calls for waterfall training! To shock some sense into you! Please, dear. Teiichi! - Teiichi! - Brother! I'll go train at the waterfall. Teiichi. I'll create my own empire. Because in my own empire, no one will stop me from playing the piano. Teiichi... I haven't touched the piano since that day. Teiichi... I wanted to be free to play piano. That's the only reason I wanted my own empire. Just... Just for that? For years and years, you've been fighting for that? Now, I'll never be able to play. I'm sorry. The student council election will be held today. Did you see Akaba's dad on the news? This doesn't look good for Morizono. "Teiichi Akaba's father is a criminal" I found this. Will it hurt us? Of course it will! Let's go. It's election day. Brother. Your friends are here. Teiichi, it's me. It's Dan! Open up. Teiichi! Go away. My battle is over. Teiichi, let's go vote. You worked so hard. Please leave. And pay for my door. I thought you wanted to be president. It's impossible now. Leave. You said you owed me. Komei! Mimiko! - Long time, no see. - It's been so long! - You cut your bangs? - You noticed! Let's go, Komei! Oh, yeah. How's Teiichi? Well... What's with you guys? Why don't you go vote? Leave me alone. What happened to your own empire? Isn't that why you asked Komei and Dan to help you? Now it's your turn to help them. If you even can't do that, how can you create your own empire? Yo. Where's Akaba? I finally won, Teiichi. Teiichi is here. The guy never gives up. I'm voting by absentee ballot. We're starting the election process. No outsiders, please. Stand! Bow! Sit! Where are Akaba and Togo? Togo will vote by absentee ballot. We haven't heard from Akaba. We will now elect the next student body president. This way, Mimiko. Thanks. You have some nerve, showing up here. I have the right to cast my vote. It's tainted! You're the son of a criminal. He hasn't been indicted! Move, Kikuma. Why are you here, Mimiko? I... Are you two... ...going out? Then I didn't need to get my father involved to destroy you. So Minister Togo was behind this after all! Do you have proof? Let's go, Mimiko. Teiichi! I won't let you vote. What's with the look? Shall I remind you of the days when I bullied you? That won't be necessary. It's in the forefront of my mind! Teiichi and Kikuma are fighting! Seriously? Roland Himuro! "Roland Himuro" I believe in Himuro's promise to increase our budget. Roland Himuro! Roland Himuro! Roland Himuro! Okuto Morizono! I voted for Morizono because he'll treat everyone fairly. Kikuma, let me vote. Stop it, Kikuma! You never cease to annoy me! Because of you, I was always yelled at every day after school! Top grades, best pianist. You even had Mimiko. I'm going to vote! You'll never know how it feels to never be allowed to fail! Okuto Morizono! Roland Himuro! Kikuma Togo, absentee vote for Roland Himuro! I knew I could count on him. Okuto Morizono! I received a "gift" from Himuro, but I was plagued with guilt. So I'm returning the gift. Where's Teiichi Akaba? Go home and play your stupid piano! You'll never know how it feels to be deprived of your passion! Okuto Morizono! Thank you for my gift. But my vote is a different matter. Damn you! Okuto Morizono! Roland Himuro! That's my vote. Okuto Morizono! Koma! You're kidding, right? I've always supported you. But I don't think you're fit to be president. What are you saying, Koma? We're buddies, right? The hero who saved me from bullies is gone. Koma! Hold Himuro back! What the hell? - Are you okay? - My arm is numb. The least I can do is kick your ass! We will consider Teiichi Akaba's vote forfeited. Hey, Sasaki. Vote before me. All right. Okuto Morizono! It's tied. I want to see the new Kaitei envisioned by Morizono. The last voter is Dan Otaka. Are you sure? Yes. Blank vote! Blank?! Why, Otaka? I support Morizono because I like him. But I don't know if that's enough to choose a president. To be honest, when I got here I thought you were all rich boys without any worries. I thought this was all child's play. But I was wrong. You're all trying, fighting something. I'm not one to cast a deciding vote. It's not my place. Sorry. Don't apologize. You were never interested in politics. I got you involved in all this. I'm the one who should apologize. Morizono. In the case of a tie, in accordance with election rules, the president will cast the final vote. President Doyama. Otaka, you forced me to vote. The best judge of who the next president should be is the person who understands the student council better than anyone. Himuro. Yes? You're a very capable guy. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be president. Thank you. - Then! - But... You taught all of us that the abuse of such power creates discrimination. And exclusion is dangerous. History has already proven that. Wait a minute! Morizono hasn't contributed anything to your presidency! I've supported you! I'm willing to lick your shoes! Morizono hasn't contributed? That's not true. He taught me the true nature of leadership. Without any backing, he moved everyone around him and reversed the tide of this election. A dictator with one powerful backer, or a man who reaches the top with the help of all his pawns. Who'd make a better president? The answer is clear. I'm just "a frog in a well who doesn't know the ocean." There's a second part to that saying. "But it knows how high is the sky." You can reach higher heights. You want to make me cry? Okuto Morizono. You're the new president. You're really persistent. Teiichi! Okuto Morizono! He did it! Morizono won! Morizono! Morizono! Morizono! Where's Kikuma? Did I win? You did great. I see. I won. Revenge is sweet! What about the election? Teiichi? Komei... Teiichi! Komei! What happened to you? I kicked Kikuma's ass. The election...! Morizono Senpai won! - Komei! - Teiichi! Whaaat?! Himuro! Don't! It's all over... Turn out the light... - Someone call an ambulance. - Call an ambulance! Himuro... Himuro? Teiichi... He's...he's alive! A mat? Why? I'm glad I was prepared. You put that here? You knew? No! In case you jumped if Morizono Senpai lost. It was for you. Koma... Are you... ...still my friend? Of course. We'll find a new goal. A new goal? Where? There are millions out there. Okay... - Himuro... - Himuro... - Kikuma... - Kikuma! The student council election came to a close. Himuro Senpai's attempted suicide made headline news, putting an end to the corrupt faction system at our school. In retrospect, Dan was right. The student council was crazy. I told you this story because I want you to know the truth. No, I want to take this opportunity to atone for my sins. "Politics is war without bloodshed." My favorite quote by Mao Tse Tung. But he also said this. "The people alone hold the power to create history." So I want to work for you. Please vote for your dog, Teiichi Akaba! Cut! Good job. That was cool, Teiichi. I, Teiichi Akaba, am running for student body president. I, Kikuma Togo, promise to... Please vote for Dan Otaka for student body president. Dear. Sakurako. I'm sorry for everything. How are the kids? They're both fine. Teiichi is fighting now. That's right. It's election season. Prime Minister. Akaba, don't worry about the trial. Thank you. Thanks to you, we uncovered Togo's corruption. He'll pay for his crimes. It was a toy in my son's room. I'm glad it came in handy. Your son wants to be prime minister one day, right? Yes, he's fighting as we speak. What will you do now? Give up? The entire student body will vote for their president. Please come to the gym. Teiichi Akaba, 349 votes. Dan Otaka, 350 votes. Kikuma Togo, 1 5 votes. One minute until voting closes. Everyone must decide now. 1 5 votes... I pledged my life for 1 5 votes! President Morizono! Can I vote as a candidate? Yes, you're free to vote. Hey, Teiichi! I really hate your guts. Me, too! Let's go. Teiichi Akaba, 349 votes. Dan Otaka, 352 votes. Kikuma Togo, 1 3 votes. Teiichi Akaba, 351 votes. Dan Otaka, 350. Kikuma Togo, 1 3. Akaba is now in the lead. Kikuma voted for Teiichi? Impossible. Why, Kikuma? We go way back. That's all! If you're not above me, I'll have no one to bully. Kikuma. 20 seconds left in the election! Any changes must be made now! Teiichi, may the best man win. Dan... 1 0 seconds left. 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Voting is closed! Teiichi Akaba, 350 votes. Dan Otaka, 351 votes. Togo Kikuma, 1 3 votes. Congratulations, Dan. I repaid my debt. Teiichi. You're the kind of guy who can change this school. You've helped me so many times. Now it's my turn to help you. I want to play the piano. That's enough for me. He's matured. Yes. Are you sure? We're friends, right? Teiichi! Teiichi! Teiichi! Be my Vice President. I need your support. Play at my inauguration. With pleasure! The next student body president is Dan Otaka! Teiichi. The inauguration is starting. I know. I never knew how talented you were. Hey. You haven't given up on becoming prime minister, have you? "Given up"? Those words don't exist in Teiichi's vocabulary. I thought so. Because that day... 1 0 seconds left. With seconds left, I saw Kikuma step over to Dan's camp. Kikuma wanted to lull me into a false sense of security. "Kikuma moved over." I made a split-second decision. It's better to "concede" than to "lose." By "letting him win" I won over Dan and the student body. Morizono abolished the faction game. Now, it's a popularity game. Good. You're back to your old self. Yeah, Komei. I will do it. I'll create my own empire. And I'll be there with you. In Teiichi's empire. What's this song, Komei? Teiichi's favorite song. "Marionette" Puppets, huh? Puppets? Right. Applause! That would be you guys.
