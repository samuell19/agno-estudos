Taxes are the lifeblood of this nation. Collecting taxes is a thankless job. As officers and agents of the Internal Revenue Service, we are more than just an arm of the government. We are the heart and hands of the United States Treasury. There is, however, an increasing number who willfully disregard their obligation, resist the payment of taxes, and even openly criticize the Internal Revenue Service. Washington, and all of us, are gravely concerned over this growing contempt for taxes. Agents are here with the Director to discourage noncompliance through investigation, prosecution and other statutory sanctions within our broad authority. [chattering] Harry, what are you doing? - They've already started the meeting. - Yeah, I know, I know. - Listen, will you grab this end? - What? Yeah, go out there and stretch it apart, will you? Harry, we're late. Would you come on? Watch it, watch it. Don't let it hit the ground. Look, the janitors are supposed to be doing this, not us, Harry. Janitors. You know where I found this flag? I found it wadded up... ...in a corner on the floor. The American flag. Can you believe that? Unbelievable. Thanks. Harry, when we get in there, I want you to remember what Roth said, all right? - The pension plan... - Okay. - Hey, Harry, how's that for special delivery? - Thanks, Charlie. Aunt Beverly? - Your vote's gonna make all the difference. - [man]...meeting under way. I hope everyone's here today because, as I'm sure you all know, we're going to hold an informal session on pension plan revision. Just to keep everyone clear on this, I'll read... - Harry, come on. What are you doing out here? - Huh? Say, I gotta go. Here. [sighs] One, two, three. Good. All right. Now turn around. - And... - [classical piano music] Hi, Daddy. [Kathy] Good. Thank you. Well? - He comes walking in, and then he goes to sleep. - Mm-hmm. And a bird comes and picks him up and flies away to the castle. That's right. That's absolutely right. Why don't you open the door, stupid? - Hello, Shelly. - Mom, it's for you. How's school? Uh... - Well, how are you anyway? - Fine. - Fine. Is this yours? - Mm-hmm. - Were you playing the queen today? - Mm-hmm. Well, this is for the queen. [gulping sound] - What are you doing here? - I'm visiting the queen. Go and play, sweetheart. Mmm. I thought we agreed that until all this is settled... - I just wish, just once... - I know, I know. I'm sorry. Let's not go into it. I called and nobody answered. I'm driving down to St. George tomorrow. I wanted to take the kids. Simple. You've had the kids twice this month already. Yeah. Well, it's hard to divorce your kids. I don't want a divorce. Will you go in the other room? Shelly? - Can't we go? - Go where? Yeah. Why don't we all go? Harry, we're... I'm not going to... to St. George. [sighs] I guess they can go if they want to. It's up to them. Mm-hmm. Well, I guess it's just you and me, Your Majesty. [Kathy] I don't want her going without you. - Mom! - Oh, come on. It'll be fun. I'll show you where I grew up. - When will they be back? - I'm not sure. Oh. I'm going to meet an old friend of mine. A lady named Beverly Payne. Can you kids be ready by 8:00? - Harry? - Thank you, dear. Uh, Kathy, thank you. See ya. Well, seems like I've always known Beverly. We got to be really good friends when I was about nine. When my mom died. Was she divorced? I don't know. She was alone most of the time, so was I. Hmm. We needed each other, I guess. For four or five years there, she was my Aunt Beverly, and I was her Button. Button? Oh, brother. [chuckling] Yeah, she never called me Harry. That was a long time ago. But you know... ...she was really good to me when I needed it. Hmm-hmm-hmm. Um, you kids stay here for a while, okay? Oh, can't we go? Well, I want to see if she still likes children before I turn you two loose on her. Okay, Button. [gunshot] You stand up like that, you're gonna get yourself killed. Huh? Does Beverly Payne still live here? You tax boys, you never learn. Tax? I'm-I'm not... M-My name is Harry Johnson. I-I'm an old friend. She wrote me a letter. I'm... I'm Button. Button? Hey, it's them, Beverly! It's Button! Button? Aunt Beverly? [chuckling] Button. - Surprised? - Oh, I should say so! I wasn't expecting you. Why didn't you tell me that you were coming? Let me look at you. Oh, I can't see anything with these glasses. They always put the line right where you look. If I had known that was you, I never would have... - You look older. - You've changed a lot too. - Well... - You don't look older though. My blood is old, four eyes, and my sinuses are... - Are these your children? - Yeah. Harry, where's their mother? - She's... - Mothers should stay with their children nowadays. All this liberation is just ruining family life, you know that? - Kathy and I decided that... - Well, you all look hungry. Are these children getting enough potassium? Oh, this leg. I got to get off of it. Well, we're having stew tonight. - Here's a friend for you. - [meowing] Here you go. Now come on in, and we'll feed you in a jiffy. Oh. [sighs] Stairs are getting taller every day. [man coughing] [coughing continues] [toilet flushes] Hello, everybody. Come on in. How's Joseph? [woman] He's fine. Coming home from the hospital maybe Wednesday. [Beverly] Oh. You girls go and sit over there by Billy. Welcome to the mission, brother. - Thank you. - You're in good hands. - She'll help you. - Van, shush. Time for the blessing. Dear Lord, with knowledge thy hand in all things. We thank you for these foods from thy earth. Protect us from sin and the Russians. And please forgive the secret rulers if you can. And give us the strength to preserve our freedoms and to endure all things. Prolong the inevitable and bless the food. Amen. Now we have some new friends here tonight. Get up and introduce yourself. Tell them your name. Come on. Don't be shy. Up, up, up. Hi. [clears throat] You can... call me Draper. [chuckles] This is Draper, everybody. Oh. Hi, I'm Harry Johnson. These are my children, Shawn and Shelly. - Stand up, dear. - Who is it? Oh, this is Button. He's an old, old friend of mine. We hope he's going to be here with us. Now eat and enjoy the Lord's patient bounty in the shadow of the famine. Tell him about the nuclear fireball. Oh, yeah. Well, the desert sands are gonna fuse into one great sheet of radioactive glass capping off the wells. And then they'll retaliate, and that'll poison public opinion and open up the door to war. Will you pass the bread? Sure ain't like war used to be. We used to have fun. Now they started on me eight years ago. Right after Russia buried the bombs. - Bombs? - The cobalt bombs. Under the fault. I've never had an audit, and then Scelera came. - Scelera? - Yes. Tax agent. He'd work, you know, a day here, two days there. He even stayed for stew one time. It just went on for months. You have to provide them with a place to work. - Did you know that? - Mmm. Well, he couldn't find anything. But that didn't mean anything. He said he had a feeling, you see. And so he couldn't quit snooping around. - It was just driving me crazy. - Well, you know what they say. The two things you can count on are death and taxes. Ah. Well, they're the same thing, Button. He never let go. And he was talking to everybody about strange old Beverly Payne. This just... Insulting questions, you know? Like I was some kind of criminal. People hardly even talk to me anymore. "The IRS was thrown out on its ear today by the irate proprietor of Beverly's Antiques and Surplus. If he comes back, Mrs. Payne was quoted, I'll bite his ear off and... staple it to my 1040 form." [chuckles softly] Looks like he believed you. Then about a month ago, I received a deficiency notice for $192,654. Wow. I want you to take it over, Button. What do you mean, take it over? Everything. Look around you. I just... I can't handle it anymore. I'm a mailman. I wouldn't have the slightest idea what to... how to... I don't know the difference between an antique and a piece of junk. Well, there's not much difference. [clearing throat] Oh, thanks. That's okay. I'll take it now. - I just thought I'd help. - Oh, no, no, no. She don't ask or expect nothing. You know, she's been feeding folks for the last 12 years every Saturday. That's why I help. I ain't missed her stew since '65. - Why? - Why? It's good stew. - And it's kinda home. - No, I mean... Well, why does she do all this? Oh! This ain't nothing. Oh, she gives away stoves, fridges, TVs, all sorts of things. Anybody who needs 'em. She never took a penny. It's sort of a mission. Is it always like tonight? Always stew. Ain't always pie. [chuckling] No. I mean... ...all that political stuff. She always preach like that? That ain't preaching. That's just Beverly. Well, you can't give your whole life away. If you don't take it, they will. Now I don't mind a fight, but I just... - I don't like to lose. - Oh, you're not gonna lose. This is America. Nobody can take your property from you. It's... We have the Bill of Rights. Yes. Well, if the boys who wrote that knew what was going on, they'd all go to Canada. This is just a misunderstanding. All we'll do is we'll just talk to them. [sighs] Oh, Button, Button, Button. Bless your faithful heart. You just refuse to see any evil in the world, don't you? Oh, well. [sighs] Guess I... ...shouldn't expect to change you. I just thought you'd be excited, that's all. Good night, Harry. Harry's Antiques. [chuckles] - [knocking] - Yes? Oh, I'm sorry. Don't get up, don't get up. I'll do it. [clicks tongue] Aw... Thank you. "She waved an old battle-ax, and they picked up their guns and ran." Their guns. Do you have any idea how much we spend on our public image? This kind of publicity sets us back a million dollars. Most people are not even aware that we're allowed to carry guns. Now you cannot afford this, Ernie. Drop it. Croft, I'm con... I'm convinced that that woman is wealthy. She owns half of World War II out there. Hiding behind this phony mission, she pays no taxes. Possibility of conviction is an absolute requisite in all cases falling under the directive. - Now you know that. - We're building probabilities. She's a classic case. Trust me. Who is this Johnson? Probability? - Uh... - Huh? Sorry. - Hi. - Oh, hi. The kids told me you were leaving. I brought a box of your stuff. From the garage? Oh. Have you... Have you had lunch? No, I... Look. I feel really dumb coming over here like this. I just thought I ought to... ...say good-bye, at least. You don't have to feel dumb. Don't you think you ought to take a sick leave or something? See how you like it. Before you throw your whole life up for a... ...a junkyard. It's not a junkyard. Besides, you're the one who was always after me to take chances. You're not doing it for me. Besides, I didn't say take chances. - I said assert yourself. - Every time I did, you stopped me. Alaska? That was ridiculous. Well, somehow I thought you'd be excited. Well, I'm surprised. I'm... This is gonna work out. I'm telling you. I just know it. I have a feeling. [sighs] This Beverly must be quite a woman. Yeah. She is, you know? She... She's really something. I didn't want to say anything about it in there. I hope I did the right thing. I just heard that... Yeah. Some discretion is wise. I think you did well, really. Let's just keep it... - It seems to me if we really... - We'll talk about this, all right? Good. Be right back. [Ernie] Hey, that was a great question. - Ron. - Hi. How are you? Your contribution was way out of line in there. But it's true. I... Well, the codes are so full of exceptions and complexities that it doesn't make any sense. The opinions that you choose to voice in a room full of Washington morons and district policy are two entirely different things. - Ernest? - You didn't clear any of that stuff with me. Walking on the edge, you know that? - Come here. - Yeah? [Ernie] Boy, what a schedule you've got. - Back to Washington? - One more regional symposium. It was an inspiring speech. Really. Everybody said. I was just talking to Hamill. Gave fire and purpose to the new directive. Really wonderful. I got it. You know, with your target roster for investigations, it is clear that you are way ahead of all of us in this. And just one more thing, Ernie. Off the record. Now we both know that you're the logical appointment for district director. But I would very carefully consider this whole Beverly Payne matter. It's over, Croft. Trust me. She is right there. Example number one. [humming softly] - [door shuts] - Hi. - How was school today? - Boring. And what did you do today? Well, I wrote a letter to Aunt Beverly, but since I couldn't write, I drawed a picture. Whoa. That's pretty. - Is Aunt Beverly pretty? - Uh-huh. How old is she? Oh, about old as Mommy. Does she look like me? No, 'cause she's real big up here. You are Treasury officers. Special agents. Croft went crazy when he saw this. "Battle-ax." [snickering] Let me tell you something, Pond. I'm gonna be director of this district, whatever it takes. And I'm not gonna let your inabilities stand in my way. Is that clear enough, Pond? I want the Payne property locked up. Sorry. - May I help you? - Yes. But I'm not sure I know who I have to see. Well, you must have some idea what you want. Well, yes. I have a friend. Well, actually, she's a business associate. Her name is Beverly Payne. And for the last 12 years... - May I have your name, please? - Johnson. Harry Johnson. [typing] [whirs] I'll be right back. Sure. - [hums softly] - [phone rings] - [whistling softly] - [clicks tongue] So, the guy that I finally talked to said he wasn't sure why the contributions would be disallowed. The IRS makes mistakes like this all the time. He set a conference up so that we can sit down and straighten the whole thing out. - Yes. And if we don't? - Then we have to go to tax court, he said. Ha. Well, guess who will win? Well, we will. Any jury in the world will come down on our side. There's no jury in the tax court. There's just a judge. There's a tax judge, and a whole room full of IRS attorneys. - Are you sure? - Oh, yes. The only way to get to a real court is to pay the money first. $190,000? And then you have to sue the government to get it back. Well, that doesn't seem right. Well, the way things are and what's right are very seldom the same. Beverly says before we get one of those IBCM missiles out, whammo. One circle and the Russian cosmo-deals'll burn 'em. With particle missile burners. That's very dumb. That don't make no sense. Hey, listen, boy. You're eating her stew. Oh, Billy, a man's belief has nothing to do with his stomach. We've been fed fiction so long for truth, we think fiction is better. They control the newspapers, TV, everything. Tell him about the "lie-zer" beams, Beverly. Well, they're our salvation. Because if we could destroy the cosmo-spheres with our landing site lasers... Oh, he's not interested in that. [Kathy] Shawn? Before they ran into this "thermer" boomer problem... [Beverly] Thermal-blooming, Billy. Thermal-blooming. I told you 90 times. She's more crazy than you are. Hey, listen. You can say anything you want about me. Don't you say anything about Beverly. [Beverly shouts] Oh, Billy! So rude! Here, you dropped this. What is this? Is this a tape recorder? Oh, it's-it's nothing. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. - I really am. - Oh! It's a job. That's all. - Draper. - That's all it is. I'm... Beverly, wait a minute. Look... - Wait a minute! Beverly, look! No! - Beverly... [shouting continues] - Wait a second! - Wait, wait, wait. - No, wait. Wait a minute. - [shouting continues] [Harry] No! Get out of here. Ow. - Ow. - Stop it. Hello, dear. Beverly... Kathy, this is Beverly. Beverly, this is my... - Mother of my children. - Oh, you're just in time for stew. Come on in, please. We were just discussing the thermal-blooming problems with laser weapons. Well, sit down, sit down. You like stew? This is home. Well, you're going to have to share a pillow. You'd think with all of this, I'd have an extra pillow. Oh, I hate them to kill the ducks, but I don't like foam. - We can't stay. - Of course you can stay. I've already got the children tucked in. They're very comfortable. - But we're not... - What? I'm... We're almost divorced. Oh. Well, almost divorced is still married. From a cranky old woman who's been going to bed alone for 33 years, I think you better take some advice. Share the pillow. Good night. [Harry] Oh, the possibilities of this place are really phenomenal. Come on in. See, I have this idea to clear out all that junk up there... Come here. I'll show you. ...and make it a lunch place, or something. Like sandwiches. Simple stuff. Here. Come on. - Let me show you. - Harry. We've really got to go. Can't you wait till Beverly gets back? You promised we could play hide-and-go-seek. - Great idea. Mommy's it. - Uh-uh. I don't want to play... - Oh, yeah, you do. - Look, it's too dangerous with all this stuff around here. No, it's not dangerous at all. Now don't peek. All right. Just one time. Then we're leaving. - Okay. All right. - Now be careful. - Let's go, guys. - Okay, I'm counting. [Shelly] Here's a good spot to hide. In here. I can't hide in there. It's too small. You hide in there. Here I come, ready or not! - What are you doing? - Shh! Playing hide-and-seek. Quiet. Those are land mines you're sitting on, son. Ooh. Whoa. Well, let me see. You've already sprung one. [gasps] Billy. Well, they... they can't be active, can they? We'll know when you get up. You know, I remember a couple of guys in France who tried this once. - Both got killed. - Oh, my... - Easy, now. Easy. - That's so sad. - Gotta get hold of the pin. Easy. - Yeah. [whispering] Easy. Easy. Okay, I got it. [whispering] Easy. Easy. [timer rings, stops] It's diffused. It says "diffused" on it. It's painted right there. It says "diffused." Worst kind. Maybe there's water in that barrel. - Easy. - Will it work? [indistinct] I don't remember. - [mirthless chuckle] - Yeah. Easy. - I got hold of the pin. - Okay. Easy. [grunts] Easy. Easy, Harry. Very easy now. [meows] [meowing] [meows] - [Kathy] Shelly? - That's not fair. You're supposed to look. [Shelly] Mom? Shel? Are you all right? [soft groan] Oh, honey. [soft grunt] Come on. [soft grunt] Go! [hissing] Get in the car. What happened? - It's a long gray belly. Antipersonnel mine, ma'am. - Shh. Shh. K-Kathy, wait, wait. Kathy, wait a minute, wait a minute. [Kathy] They are never coming here again. [Harry] It was an accident, sweetie. You know, I came here hoping that we... [growls] Never mind. - Kathy, wait a minute. Can't we talk about this? - No! Be cheaper to buy the store. Start by paying this. [register dings] $440 for the last stuff. Bounced higher than a kite. It bounced? It's been attached. What do you mean, attached? I mean your bank account has been seized under orders from the IRS. They can... They can do that? See, it's simple. I've got over $600 in the account. Excuse me. You had me do this one last week. Yes, but this won't work. Look. When you do 885F manually, you can't fill out 25 through 29 on 5226. - It doesn't say that. - Please. Just do it again. Now listen. It's my break. She'll take care of you over here. But I have a... Uh... What did you want now? I just explained it all to the... - I'm Harry Johnson. - And you're whose attorney, Mr. Johnson? No. I'm here for myself. Could I talk to somebody, please? It says here that Mr. Hamill, the guy you're supposed to... Well, he's not here today. He's auditing my books, and he hasn't the slightest idea why my bank account has been attached. [clicks tongue] You have to pay your taxes, Mr. Johnson. [chuckles softly] You ought to see Hamill's supervisor. Thank you. Now without the file, it would be impossible. - But you'll be notified. - What do you mean notified? Are you going to give me a note to buy groceries? How do I run my business? You'll have to excuse me now. But talk to Hamill. Well, I... I talked to Hamill. Excuse me. I'd like to talk to the director. - The director's canceled his appointments. - I just need that much time. I have two questions. They have attached my bank... Does it occur to you that something else is going on here? - I just want to talk to him for two minutes. - There's absolutely no way. Call back next week. [to caller] I'm sorry. Now we were... Yes. Uh-huh. [typing] Okay. Mm-hmm. Excuse me, Mr. Director. My name is Harry Johnson. - I have been in this building for three hours... - What are you doing? - [man] Who is this, Rodney? - I'm talking to the director. - You can't do that. - Yes, I can. What's going on out there? I've been here for three hours, trying to talk to somebody. - Give me... - I'm trying to... Let me talk to the machine! - You can't go in there! - Sir, I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. - But something is happening that I can't... - Rodney, call Security. Oh, please, Mr. Director. My name is Harry Johnson, and for three hours, I've been... I know who you are, Johnson. You were... You were here before. No. That's something else. Look, I have been under an... Taxes, Mr. Johnson, are what we pay for a civilized society. It is the duty of every citizen to properly report and fully pay his fair share of that responsibility. The measures this office takes are legal, fair and necessary. Wait. There's some mistake here. If there is a mistake, Mr. Johnson, your cooperation in the Beverly Payne matter will be very beneficial. Your problems are still little ones. [door shuts] [Harry] So, it's really pretty simple. The amount of what she has given away is considerably more than the deductions taken over the years. That includes the appliances and the furniture. But it doesn't include Saturday night stew. Well, for instance, there is a farm laborer's wife and three children that have... Objection. Your Honor... Sustained. Again, Mr. Johnson, please restrain these feelings of fondness for the defendant and her friends. I fear it's never been entirely clear to Mr. Johnson that whether or not Mrs. Payne made the alleged contributions is really not at issue. - We concede your grossly belabored point. - Oh. The district has ruled, Your Honor, that Beverly's mission is not exempt under sections 501(c)(3) or 170(c), but is rather clearly a political organization and as such is not eligible for charitable contributions. She produced a weapon and ordered us off the property. Had you properly identified yourselves? There could have been no mistake. What were her specific words, do you recall? Something about showing us what the right to bear arms was all about. She quoted the Constitution? - Yes. - Thank you, Mr. Pond. Oh, one thing. Did you bring charges against Mrs. Payne? No. Mr. Scelera felt it would be beneath the benevolence of the service to bring charges against a woman in her emotional condition. [Beverly] ...all that going. And the [indistinct] conspiring to keep the President under sedation. Remember? I told you that last week. And out of control until after the first strike. Yes. Who wants more rolls? All right. And then, you see, their destructive plan is gonna be fully operational. Well, who's got the butter? Pass it on down... Whose voice is that? Beverly Payne's. - And you've been denied credit at the bank. - My account is attached. You know that. You attached it. And you're being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service now? - It was a routine audit. - Yes or no will do. - No. - But you are being audited. Your Honor, may I object from here? Well, I'll just overrule. Mr. Johnson, do you know what this is? It's Beverly Payne's will. A copy. - Have you ever read it? - No. But you know what's in it. No. "No." Mr. Johnson, do you expect this court to believe that you are the sole heir to Beverly Payne's estate, her close confidant, her advocate, and you don't know? Are you an attorney, Mr. Johnson? No. Have you ever read the Internal Revenue Code? Well, you know, I did try. Do you know there are 36,048 pages in there, and the print's really small. I mean, it's really... Have you any possible qualification other than your own personal interest in her estate to argue in a court of law? - Is that question really pertinent? - Most pertinent, Your Honor. When this court knows what Mr. Johnson knows about Mrs. Payne, we'll know the size of the iceberg. Your Honor, I don't understand all of this. [judge] Just answer the question. Well, I'm not qualified to be here, if that's what he means. About that much, he's right. It's just all so confused. We're talking about things that I don't... It's just been blown up and out of proportion. - Just get back in the witness box and sit down. - Your Honor, please. For one minute, may I be forgiven the formalities of the court and just explain this whole thing? Just explain it. Your Honor, this proceeding is an embarrassment to the bar. [judge] Very well. You may continue. Your Honor, I'm sorry. I've made such a farce of this whole thing. No one has more respect for the law than I do. I know you have more important things to do. I didn't want to bother... I thought it was simple, that's all. I... I brought Aunt Beverly's papers down here to show you about the deductions. But I see that's not what it's about. He said that Beverly Payne's mission was not charity, but politics. Your Honor, she doesn't care whether people agree with her or not. People are hungry, so she helps them, that's all. Is she going to be taxed for that? Well, I mean, in a way, aren't deductions supposed to encourage people to look after each other so the government won't have to? Well, I just don't think she should be taxed... ...for trying to help people. That's all. Mrs. Payne, your attitude and actions represent a flagrant violation of our tax laws. For example, Code Section 7201, 7203. Evasion of taxes, failure to keep records and supply information. Concealing property subject to levy, ignoring summons, and most seriously, the forcible interference with the administration of our tax laws. It is therefore the considered decision of this court that the position of the Internal Revenue Service is upheld and sustained. - The court is now adjourned. - Not adjourned. You call this justice? Pompous nincompoop. This is just a travesty. - Damn it. - Bailiff. Bailiff. You call yourselves a court? Well, you're not. You're nothing. Where is conscience? Where is justice? Where... Where is anything that will have... [choking] - Harry, is she all right? - [Beverly groans] - Is she all right? - I don't know. [crying] Oh, Button. Oh, so much I didn't tell you. It's not over. Do you know how much I love you, Button? - Yeah, it's all right. - Oh. It's all right, it's all right. It's oxygen, it's oxygen. It's all right. I'm here. - [bells ringing] - [baby cries] [crying continues] I'm sorry about Beverly Payne, Johnson, sincerely. I am. Isn't killing her enough for you people? Look, you blame us, I know. But it's not our fault, Johnson. Beverly Payne frustrated the system. So the system fought back with every... Look, Johnson, people who ram their heads against a wall eventually die. Privilege of freedom, I guess. This is a privilege of freedom, huh? Don't be stupid. People like Beverly Payne destroy themselves. I came here to offer you a compromise. Compromise? This is my property! This property was illegally transferred in anticipation of death. Look, either way, it belongs to us. You're wrong. You are wrong! What do you think this country is about, Johnson? It's about housing. Education. Defense. Welfare. Medicare. Highways. Social Security. It's about taxes, Johnson. She was... She was a fool. Leave. Leave. - Johnson, don't... - Now! Well, then you're the fool, Johnson. I'm the United States Treasury. What are you? I'm... What... You can't beat the United States Government, Johnson. Not in a million years. Your taxes will be paid. We get it one way. We get it another. But we will get it. Oh, by the way, Johnson. You're trespassing here. - [meowing] - Shh. [rooster crows] [man on radio] Good morning. It's 7:00. This is KJAC radio-TV, and your morning update. And a beautiful morning it is. High today will be in the upper 60s, and the skies will be clear and sunny. Following the news this morning, Public View will discuss taxes, friend or foe, with our special guest, Internal Revenue Service District Director Ernie Scelera. So we hope you join us for that. It should be interesting. Headlining the news this morning... [continues, indistinct] [zipper zips] - Hi. Roger Scofield. - Hi, Roger. Ernie Scelera. Nice to be asked here tonight. Look, the main thing I want to avoid is this whole Beverly Payne business. Her collapse in the courtroom. All that. - Your people promised me you'd let that alone. - Mm-hmm. Okay, I have some supplementary materials here. Okay, this is a list of the recommended questions that will bring out the essential points that I want to hit. These are of particular importance. These right here? Okay. Excuse me. Good morning. I'm Roger Scofield, and this is Public View. Last week, a woman collapsed and died in tax court. The new District Director of the Internal Revenue Service is here to discuss that... ...and other matters in the Public View. Now we worked with Mrs. Payne hand in hand over many years to try and solve some of the problems that she had. It was a sincere effort. But she did die after an emotional outburst in tax court. There's no connection. The Internal Revenue Service is the single most important part of the United States government. There are two million people who file no income tax returns. So far they have gone unprosecuted, but we're gonna change that. The Constitution simply didn't contemplate the requirements of our contemporary society. Taxes are a part of life, and they will be collected. The so-called power of the IRS is necessary to ensure collections. Some people insist on fighting against the system, but they only destroy themselves. Never have we been in more complete... ...control of taxpayers than we are now. And we intend to keep moving... ...in that direction. We still have a few... small... problems. I have something to say! Get a camera over here. Turn around here on two. Right here, sir. I declare war on the Internal Revenue Service of the United States. I'm challenging the right of the IRS to assess, harass, intimidate and seize property of the citizens without due process. [siren wailing] I'm challenging the right of the IRS to destroy people. People like Beverly Payne. Move it out. Move it out. The God that gave us life gave us liberty at the same time. I think that most of you people will understand... - Is it a new show or something? - No. ...is trying to keep those liberties alive. I declare war on the IRS and all the... little men who've become their tyrants. [Harry] ...at the same time. I think most of you people... It's Dad. Mommy, Mommy, come here. Daddy's on television. We Americans have risen up against tyranny before and we will rise up again. In the words of another patriot, "We will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God." It's time that somebody did something. Stop him. Stop him! I'm not a part of this. I'm just watching. He tried to kill me, you idiot. I am the-- God-- Federal Government. Move! Get him now! Get him in your car! - Wait a minute. - Get in your car! Hold it. Hold it. Go! Go! Open the door. Open the... [siren wailing] You buffoon! I love it. Get that thing over, mister. Get it over there! Do you hear me? Pull it over! Pull it over! [siren continues] [chickens clucking] [siren wailing] Hold it up now. Come on. Hold it up. All right now. Hold it right there, son. Now listen to me. I hate to pay taxes just like you do. Now we can work something out. I mean, this is... Now, boy, listen. You're getting... getting into trouble. Don't you start that thing up. Hey, hold it. Stop it! Stop! Stop it! You fool! Well, damn! Crap. You hit it. Oh, my car. Yeah. Yes. I'm... I'm dimly aware... [phone ringing] ...of some problems. Senator, I assure you that there's no problem. There's been some flap. Yeah. - Yeah. - [woman] Mr. Scelera, line three. Just... Just a second. Hello? Who is this? Do I need you? Oh, hi. Did you find Johnson? [woman] I assure you Mr. Scelera has the matter... Well, where did you look? Clowns didn't even check out there. Why not? [all talking] Oh, yes. They're on their way out there right now. Pull your people out. I'm sending mine in. - No. I don't... - Hey, please. Can I have a statement, sir? [all talking] - No. Hold it. - [phone ringing] Nobody says boo to the press but me. Got it? You guys leak this thing, and you're going to be patrolling school crossings. I assure you that Mr. Scelera has the matter well in hand. - [woman] Treasury Department, line three. - Hello? Yeah. There are three more from the press here. Hold it. No statements. I want those people out of here. They get nothing. And listen... That's another thing. I want a total blackout on this thing. No statements. Nothing. Oh now, hey. Don't worry about her. - She won't let us down. - I'm sorry. I missed that. [people talking] Just one statement from you. [reporters clamoring] What the devil have you done? You realize what you have started? You could be single-handedly responsible for the destruction - of income taxes in our country. - Call you back. This whole damn system works on a bluff. You know that. Once it's blown, we go back to a constitutional government, Ernie. You'll be selling shoes. Why did you let her die in our court? [sighs] Don't be ridiculous. Where would he get a land mine? Where'd he get a tank? Oh, come on. He's bluffing. [hissing] [panting] * Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light... * We're sitting ducks. They're all around us. Gettin' out of here. [stammering] * At the twilight's last gleaming * * Whose broad stripes and bright stars * * Through the perilous fight * O'er the ramparts we watched * * Were so gallantly streaming? * * And the rockets' red glare * The bombs bursting in air * Gave proof through the night * * That our flag was still there * * Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave * * O'er the land of the free * And the home of the brave? * - Mr. Scelera. - That's okay. It's okay. What's so secret? No secrets. No secrets. We'll cooperate with you guys any way possible. We like the press. It's just that in consideration for the guy's privacy, figured it'd be better... Hey. Off the record, okay? Sure. Guy is crazy. Really sad. They took him into custody last night. They moved... moved him to the hospital for psychiatric examination. The war with Harry Johnson is over. Then why all the security? [cow moos] Because he planted explosives. This whole hill is a bomb. The governor has very kindly given me the National Guard to clean it up, but they're not here yet. You understand? This is Special Officer Crawley. She'll be in charge here. Any further questions you may have, she can answer. - Tight. All right? - Mm-hmm. Move it, Paul. Johnson, it's 10:15. You got less than an hour to be out of there. Do you understand me? Major Andrew. - You Crawley? - Yes. I'm damned offended about the politics you used to get me out here. They suggested we could depend on your full cooperation. Reckless driving. Unlicensed vehicle on a state highway. 200 dollars' damage to a barn and four dead chickens. What the hell do you want with the army? He's declared war on the Internal Revenue Service. Well, if declaring war is against the law, he should be in jail, not conquered. Lady, you're talking to the United States Army. And you are talking to the United States Treasury, Major Andrew. I don't think he's coming out of there. Let me have that bullhorn. Hey there, young fella. Can you hear me? Look. Look, son. We don't wanna have to do anything drastic now. Why don't you just come on out, and let's talk this whole thing over? Are you listening? - Sir. - Good night! It's not the first. You want me to hard-charge in there with the whole damn army and blast some demented boy shooting arrows? They're messages. It's the same every time. Then why don't you get him the damn TV cameras? There's a press blackout. Well, by the saints, I won't do it. I think you will, Major. If you want him alive, you get him out of there. When I come back, I'm gonna level that cracker barrel. [cocking weapons] [gunshots] [hissing] [gagging] [coughing] [sighs] [Billy] I don't believe those tax guys are telling me the truth. He ain't in the hospital now. I'm telling you. I called the hospital. [Kathy] Billy. Billy. Where's Harry? I don't know, but I feel like I'm being left out of this war. You mean he isn't here? I think they got him pinned down up there. Yeah. [whispers] Like [indistinct] in 1943. Yeah. Billy. Billy, is he all right? I don't know. But he's gonna be the next president. If they don't get to him first. I can't believe this. [sighs] Billy, we gotta help him. What do we do? I think it's time to reenlist. [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] Are you sure? They won't do nothing with the kids and all of us. Come on. Get in here. Ooh. It stinks in here. There used to be cows in here when it was a dairy. Shh. Watch that. Watch it. That's a mine. I never knowed no woman to come through here for me like this. Uh-oh. There's another one. [screams] Hide yourselves. Somebody's coming. [Kathy] Over there. Get down. [screams] [banging, clattering] Harry. Harry! Kathy? Oh. Are you all right? You got her? That man scared me out of my wits. What's that? Which man was that? [screaming] Are you crazy? There's children here. Oh, geez. They ain't supposed to be shooting at kids. I'm telling you something. That guy's in trouble. [explosion] Billy, why did you bring 'em here? Kids, come on. Take 'em down to the cellar. [Shawn] We saw you on TV. - It was my idea. - Your idea? You get down to the cellar too. Oh, no. Look, Harry, I thought of 50 ways to say this to you, a-a-and I can't... You look wonderful. You picked a funny time to visit, you know. I should explain. I want to explain. Don't say anything. You're here. I'm sorry. You can't stay here. You don't understand what's going on. [whispers] Hey. Hey. You know, if all the people who ever tried to do anything, tried to right some wrong, had any idea how it was going to turn out, I don't think they'd ever begin. I was just sure that everybody would understand, you know? Well, if you're counting on anybody hearing about this, it's gonna end right here. What do you mean? Well, they got you blacked out like London '41. Everybody thinks you're tucked away in the nuthouse. Oh, great. You've got to tell 'em. Course you ain't too bad with that arrow slinging. Billy, listen to me. Can you get out of here again? Listen. Some day I'm gonna tell you some real war stories. All right. Tell the TV, tell the papers, tell the radio, tell everybody. Get them out here. People have got to know about this. It's the only chance we've got. - Right, skipper. - Okay. [groans] [vehicle approaching] It's the army. I don't think they know you're just trying to make a point. [man giving commands] Major Andrew. We don't want this property damaged. It belongs to the U.S. Treasury. I'll handle it, Crawley. They're the only ones who know we're here. You don't suppose that they could just erase us and nobody would know, do you? Oh, you gotta get out of here. Roger. Unit C ready and standing by, sir. Set the charges. Attention in the house. This is your last warning. Surrender or we will attack. Surrender or we will attack. Wait for me. Okay, kids. Let's go. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It's about time. They're coming out this way. I seen 'em. Follow me. I'm sorry, sir. We are under army orders. What are you doing? [automatic gunfire] [Harry] Get down! Get back! Get back! Get back! [Kathy] Stay down. The tunnel is mined, sir. Send Unit B and the sweep to Unit C. B Sweeper to Charlie. Hey. Hey, man, give me a hand. My arm's stuck. Hey. Psst. There are kids in there. Come on. Take 'em to the cellar. You'd think the U.S. Army could have one man in custody by now, Major. Two little children. There are two little children in there, you maniac. Why didn't you tell me he had hostages? Hostages? What are you talking about? There couldn't be. Attention all units. This is Major Andrew. The enemy has hostages. Repeat, repeat. There are two kids in that house. Pull back and stand by. All right. Step down. Got her, honey? - Oh. - [meows] Now, listen. No matter what happens, stay down there. I'm just gonna try to talk to them to explain this thing. That's the United States Army out there. How do you say I'm sorry for a war? Whatever happens... I love you all. Be careful. [Crawley] Major, I insist that you continue. That man must be brought into custody. There are no hostages. You shut up. Please shut up! Why in the hell did they ever send a woman out here anyway? My sex is not an issue here, Major. It most certainly isn't. Stand by for hostage negotiation. Major, do you realize that that man has assaulted federal officers, rescued government property under force of arms? The only thing that I realize, Crawley, is that I might... ...I just might be on the wrong side in this war. [vehicles approaching] [man shouting] Charge, you mother! Thank you, Sergeant. Chief, we're going to do a network thing here and... How are you? Good to see you again. - We got a job to do. - We have a press thing up here. - You're doing a wonderful job. - I'm doing the very best... [man] Stay tuned to this channel for further updates on the war... Excuse me. We're doing a network thing. - Excuse me please. - Ladies and gentlemen, please! - Ladies and gentlemen... - We don't know exactly... [Crawley] This is federal property! This is federal property! You understand? - [Sheriff] Stop it! - [gunshot] Now hold it! We'd like to have your cooperation, please, by standing back behind the lights! Now there's a subject up there with hostages! He's dangerous, and he's armed! I told you Scelera said no press. They can't be here! Well, you tell 'em then. Get on that step. This is federal property, and you are trespassing. I'm a federal officer. I want... I demand that you leave at once. You are unauthorized to take pictures. I said... Do you understand? Get out! Out! Out! Get out! [Andrew] Johnson, can you hear me? Son, we still don't want to hurt you. You understand? You gotta trust me, Johnson, and you can. Release the hostages. Let them kids go. Johnson, you hear me? Informed sources here say the hostages are actually Johnson's family who have joined him in this courageous last battle to keep his home. There've been no formal charges, as far as we can tell, no court orders. Only demands from the IRS. And they've refused comment. All America is watching tonight. Some here call this "Harry's War." But could it be that he is actually fighting for us all? Hold it. Hold it. He wants to exchange hostages. He'll make a deal. There are no deals. Get those cameras out of here. The man is a criminal. He'll trade the hostages for the district director. No. I am in charge here. Go get Scelera. Yes, sir. - Mr. Scelera. - Mr. Scelera. Why did you claim Johnson... Who actually owns the house? You or probate? Come on, guys. I've had no time to prepare a statement. - Give us one statement. - Okay, okay. One comment. That's it. Okay? The Internal Revenue Service, in the interests of Mr. Johnson's privacy, has made every effort to handle this very difficult problem quietly. But Harry Johnson is a sick man. He's a dangerous man. He has repeatedly violated the law. He has abused his rights. He's refused to cooperate, and he's taken this final, desperate, illegal, self-destructive course. Huh? Has he actually broken the law or just the IRS code? Gentlemen, I'm here to try and save some hostages. All right? I just cooperated with you. Now please. That's the new district director of the Internal Revenue Service. Someone broke security. I can't believe you were this stupid. If the press gets to him... Do you realize what you've done? - I forgot the cat. - Don't worry about the cat. Now listen. When you get outside, find Billy and just get out of here. What are you gonna do? Talk to them. Try to appeal to reason. I don't know. Listen. If anything happens, take this, get it to every TV station and newspaper you can find. Send it to everybody you ever heard of, including the president. [crowd chattering] [Harry] You first. Go on. Turn around. [man] No questions. Clear it. [Sheriff] Get back! Get back! He's crazy! He's a madman! I am no madman. I admit that I'm a little angry. But I've never been more sane or seen things more clearly or understood things so well. You said you wanted to make a deal? I want an honest hearing. You've got it. I give you my word. I promise. You promise? What are you talking about? Who are you to promise me anything? Are you a judge? You tried to prosecute me. Are you trying to judge me now too? I want them to judge. Don't be ridiculous. That's impos... It's illegal. Illegal, is it? A trial by a jury of my peers. That's guaranteed to me by the Constitution. Is the IRS more important than that? Look, Johnson... Is the IRS above the Constitution of the United States, Mr. Scelera? [crickets chirping] Okay. The case of Harry Johnson versus the Internal Revenue Service. - You all right? - You can all see the government's case. I'm looking right down the barrel of it. My case is so simple it frightens people like this. With all their might and machinery and rules and confusion, they never bother with the one fact that's so simple. Who told them they could tax us? Who gave them the power to tax us? Did you? I didn't. I'm not at war with this country. I'm not even particularly against taxes. But when Mr. Scelera and his people think they have the right to come in here and seize my property without the due process of law, well, something's... Something's the matter. If I were accused of murder, I'd have more legal rights than I knew what to do with. But when the IRS audits you, they make you think you don't have any rights at all. They make their own laws. And they administer them, and they enforce them, and they prosecute them, and they judge them. All that power in one place. Boy. Hitler would have loved the IRS. So would Napoleon and Caesar. They'd understand it. I don't. Government doesn't have any right to do anything but what we give it. And they're supposed to protect us from what the IRS is doing in the name of government. That's what this is all about. That's all. [applause, cheering] [applause, cheering continues] [crowd chanting] Harry! Harry! Harry! [chanting grows louder] Get him! Get him! Get him! Arrest him, you dumb shits! Get him! Arrest him! Get your hands off me. [explosion] [screams] No! That's my husband! [Andrew] Pull out! Pull out! Get those civilians out! Move, move, move! Harry! [screaming] - Let go of me! - Hold it. - [explosions] - [screaming] Get these people out. Let's go. [explosion] This is the most repugnant scene you have ever witnessed. The house is burning. The man is still alive in there, we think. There has been no attempt to try to rescue him. Absolutely unbelievable. There is complete panic. Don't panic! Wait a minute. Let go of me! I'm the federal government. God damn it! Get your hands off me! [explosions continue] Sir. [clattering]
