everyone says there's nothing quite like christmas in the city, but it's been a long time since mommy lived here in denver. So... I forgot what it's like. It's so big. It is big. And I know it's not exactly like savannah, but it's gonna feel like home in no time, okay? Do I have to go to winter camp? We've talked about this before, tyler. With mommy starting her new job, I think it's a great way for you to find new friends before your school starts in January. Okay... Let's make a deal. If you give this a chance, I promise to make this the best christmas ever. What do you say? That's my tiger. So what do you think? What? Is there something about them you don't like? I don't know, marcus. I guess I was hoping for a little more pop. They popped for me. Thanks, barry. Good morning! Would you like a mini tree for your desk? Ah... I don't really have a desk, but... Sure. Merry christmas. Thank you. you're welcome. Emma... Yes? Oh, you've been here barely a week, but it looks like you're settling in nicely. I need you to print out my-- phone sheet? It's already on your desk, valerie. Along with your iced coffee-- two creams. Well, you certainly are a breath of fresh air. Come with me. As you know, December is one of our busiest months here at "daily lifestyle magazine." yes, the head of hr explained to me that the magazine's christmas issue is the top seller. That it is. And this year, the pressure to deliver a real page-turner is at an all-time high. But you've worked on staff before, so you know the drill. Yes. After taking time off to raise my son, I freelanced occasionally for the local newspaper in savannah. I know you're a tad overqualified for executive assistant, but there might be a junior staff position available come January... If you play your cards right. Wow... That would be incredible. I am ready to do whatever I can to make that happen. While you glance over your phone sheet, would you mind if I pass out the rest of the mini-trees that I got for everyone in the office? You really are a charmer, aren't you? Well, I just... I guess it's my way of trying to keep my small-town spirit alive in the big city. Don't let me stop you. Hi. I'm emma. Valerie's new assistant. Merry christmas. knock-knock. - who's there? - -emma sanderson. I don't think we've met. How are you? Marcus welsh. And as your typical mondays go around here, I'd say that I am fair. Well, I just wanted to drop by and say hello and give you a little something that brightens your desk. Oh, thanks... But I'm not exactly a ho-ho-ho type of guy. Seriously? Come on. What's there not to love about christmas? Well... First off, let's start with tighter deadlines, higher expectations, and a lump of coal in our stockings if we fail to deliver. Last year, I had to photograph the 12 days of christmas... In three days. That must have been quite the challenge, but I bet it made quite the spread. Are you always such a big ray of sunshine? I don't know. Are you ever one? I'm sorry. It's just my day started off a little bumpy with my lifestyle editor. -Valerie? -Yeah. I'm her new executive assistant. I started Monday. I see. In that case, I'll give this back to you, because you are going to need it a lot more than I will. What is that supposed to mean? I bet by Friday, you will be answering the phone, "bah humbug." and I bet I'll surprise you. emma? Merry christmas. Merry christmas. She's awfully chipper. Yeah. As you're all aware, our christmas issue is responsible for boosting subscribership. Unfortunately, the last three years have seen those numbers fall significantly, which is why I'm concerned that these pitches that I've been reading just don't pack the punch to turn those numbers around. I completely agree with you, miss hennessy, which is why I invited you down here to let the staff know the direction you'd like to be heading. I'm looking for something that is truly unique. Something new. Something fresh. Something captivating. We need a real page-turner. How about we do a story about a celebrity heading back to their old hometown to spend christmas with their folks? We did that in 2012. How about a piece about christmas traditions around the world? Maybe as a feature, but it's not special enough for a cover story. For our cover story, we need something that sings of christmas. Of family. Of tradition. I need a story that is going to melt people's hearts. And I am confident that you will deliver. Of course. Okay, then. I need everyone in my office bright and early with something truly inspiring. how did tyler's day go? So far, a bit on the quiet side, but I'm sure he'll warm up. Hey, ty. -How was your day? -Okay, I guess. Come on... I think we can do better than that. Why don't you try telling me what was your best and worst part of the day? -Best? -Uh-huh. You picking me up. The worst, you dropping me off. I walked into that one, didn't I? A little bit. How about we turn that around and we go meet aunt nancy for a little holiday cheer? Good? -Thank you. -Bye. look, mom-- he's really good. He is, isn't he? Aunt nancy! Folks call him "santa dean." I'm always amazed at the talent this city brings out. I got you both a little treat. Aw, thank you. Roasted chestnuts. Oh... So... How are you two settling in? So far, as well as expected. Thank you so much for helping us find a home. I'm just thrilled that you decided to pursue your career in journalism again. What finally pushed you to take the leap? Well, after my divorce, I realized that if I had any hope of teaching tyler to follow his dreams, it was time to follow my own. Only now a little older and wiser. That's the hope. How goes the pursuit so far? It's a little too soon to tell. I've quickly become aware of how long I've been gone. Make any friends yet? Yeah, one. If we count you. Give it some time. If anyone can get people to warm up, it's you. I hope you're right. The whole staff is on edge trying to come up with the next big christmas story for our holiday issue. Sounds like a ripe opportunity to prove yourself. You think? I haven't even been there a week. I don't want to come off as overzealous. From what I can remember back in college, that enthusiasm was always your strong suit. Maybe... But the editor in chief is being really picky. She doesn't want just any idea, she is asking for a christmas miracle. What's a christmas miracle? A christmas miracle? It's like... When something truly wonderful and unexpected happens this time of year. I wouldn't mind finding a christmas miracle. You will, sweetie. Didn't I promise you the best christmas ever? I'm going to need a miracle to pull this off. If anybody can, it's you. Hey, what happened to the raisins? I ate 'em. Tyler, you were supposed to use it for the door knob. I thought we could just draw it on with icing. Ah, I like the way you improvise. What do you say... We continue construction tomorrow? Okay, tiger. Time for bed. Can I sleep on the couch while you finish your work? Sure, baby. Come on. Are you missing our old life back in georgia? I know a big move can sometimes feel a little scary. But you'll see. We're going to make lots and lots and lots of new friends. Lots and lots? Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots. That'll take a christmas miracle. You just have to have faith. Okay, mister. Now close your eyes and go to sleep. you're here awfully early. Overtime, glutton for punishment, or you trying to impress the new boss? I can say the same. The truth is, I got here early because I'm working on something of my own. Well, you should know that the company frowns upon using the office for personal use. Well, actually, I came in here to work up a pitch for valerie. So you're throwing your hat in the ring. Okay, let me see what you've got. Oh, okay. Fine. If you don't want to use my years of experience on staff for a little free advice. All right, okay fine. When you put it that way, why not? Just give me a second and I'll print it out. Okay. Okay... This is... Interesting... Interesting. Interesting good, or are you just trying to be nice? No, it's interesting good. It is. But, listen, it doesn't matter what I think. Valerie's the one that you have to win over. I know that. I'm just not sure about how I should approach her on this. It's a tough one. Normally, I'd say, wait till she's in a good mood, but that's rare in December. But then when should I strike? I don't know... Catch her in a private moment, okay? Alone, without anybody else around. -Okay... -Okay? Keep your pitch brief. Let her swirl her mind in the finger paint a little bit. Okay? And the moment you get a nod, just stop talking. Okay? Valerie hates it when people babble. Fortunately, that's not me. I mean, can I get carried away with a subject sometimes? Sure. But I am totally not the person to keep going on and on and on. I'm babbling, aren't I? Just a little bit. It's okay. You'll be fine. Just remember, if she rejects your idea, don't take it personally. And if she loves it? Then don't let it go to your head. With someone like valerie, you are only as good as your last idea. Is this your way of wishing me luck? Yes. Good luck. Thank you. thank you and keep up the good work. How did the staff meeting go? I think we have some pitches with real promise. The question is will miss hennessy agree? Well, if it's all right, I would like to run by a concept by you. Go ahead. My son, tyler, is having a bit of an adjustment with the move, so last night, I decided to take him to the christmas fair to cheer him up. Anyway, my friend, nancy, and I got talking about a christmas miracle, and tyler looked up at me with eyes as big as globes, and asked, "what's a christmas miracle?" let's fast forward to the pitch, please. Sorry. That inspired me to start searching for real-life christmas miracles. So, I went on my computer last night, and I couldn't believe the things that popped up. There was a firefighter who was called to put out a christmas tree fire. It turns out it was the home of his childhood sweetheart. They rekindled their romance and got married. And that's just one example. I found dozens. A father whose life was saved when they found the perfect kidney match on christmas eve. Interesting. But I assume these stories have already been told. True. But I'm sure in a city the size of denver, there are plenty of fresh stories to be told. Let me think about it. I wrote up a little something for you to look at. You really are eager, aren't you, emma? All right. I'll look it over. If it has merit, I'll pass it by miss hennessy after lunch. You will? I will. That's great. Thank you, valerie. Thank you. -Emma... -Yeah? Is valerie out of that meeting with miss hennessy yet? No. But I'm hoping she finds a fan with my real-life christmas miracle idea. I need her to look at the proofs from the christmas cookie shoot for the recipe page. Ah, I see. What's on the menu for December? Reindeer cookies. Oh, my goodness. That is adorable. Thank you. I just hope valerie shares your enthusiasm. But I fear my timing may be off. Marcus. inches away from a clean getaway. Yes, valerie. Are these the photos for December's recipe spread? Indeed, they are. Come with me to my office. I'll take a look. Okay, here we go. Marcus, I don't have to tell you how high the expectations are for this year's christmas issue to be the best ever. Is this really the best ever? Valerie, they're photos of cookies, not the lunar landing. I didn't realize you put a dial on your enthusiasm depending on your assignments. I didn't mean it that way. The whole point of these recipes is to inspire the reader to make them on their own. Be creative. Give the reader a reason to run to their kitchen-- not turn the page. Okay. Emma, meet me in my office in five minutes. Of course. How did the pitch go with miss hennessy? Not as good as I had hoped. She approved all our features, but passed on the lead story pitches. Really? All of them? I'm afraid so. Fortunately, I came up with an area on the fly she seems to like, so I guess it will be up to me to impress the editor in chief. How's your christmas spirit feeling right about now? rejection comes with the job. That part I have no problem rolling with the punches. Okay... Then what's bothering you? It's dividing my time between work and my son. I know... It hasn't been easy on him, and I just keep wishing I could do more to help. You're doing the best you can. Then why do I run around all day with a case of mommy guilt? Because you're a good mommy. I see how hard you work to find balance as a single mom. I know it can't be easy. Thanks, and I'm not complaining. -It's.. -You want it all. I get it. Plus, I promised to give that guy a special christmas. And you will. What I remember most as a kid is that life wasn't as much about the grand gestures as it was about the moments. Moments you probably thought were trivial but will end up being tyler's fondest memories when he grows up. That's true. When I was growing up, my mom, she used to hide a secret christmas present for my sister and I. And there was something about finding that one present that made it more special than all the others. The same will happen for tyler. Thanks, nance. You're a good friend. What'd I do? Okay, it's a new day, people, and I'm thrilled to report that miss hennessy has approved all of our upcoming features for the christmas issue. Karl, I managed to salvage your celebrity concept by adding in family traditions. Soap fans have a huge audience, so I want you to pepper some in amongst the a-listers. I'll get on the phone with publicists right away. Glenda, I would like you to do a christmas spread about the hottest holiday parties in the city. Oh, and miss hennessy thought there was something fun about the tri-city christmas carol glee club competition, so I think annie and sarah, you should run with that. Love it. And as for our cover story? I'll be responsible for delivering that. Details forthcoming. Anything else? Valerie, I promised my son, tyler, we'd go christmas tree shopping after work, and I thought it might be a morale booster if I picked one up and got some decorations for the office. Oh, that's a great idea. You probably need some help with that. -Marcus? -Yes, valerie? Your docket is a little light today. Maybe you could lend a hand? Sure. I... I mean, yes, I would love to. marcus! Hey! This is my son, tyler. nice to meet you, tyler. How do you like living in denver? He's a little shy. That's okay. I was shy as well when I was your age. I barely made a peep, actually. My mom called me the "observer." I think that's why I got into photography. So you could take pictures all day? Yeah. Yeah, I do. That's got to be fun. It can be... It can be. -My mom's a writer. -Yeah? She likes telling stories. -That's what I told him. -Yeah. After taking time off to raise this guy, I realized how much I missed it. And that's why we came back to the city. That was a big move. So what is it about writing that you love so much? I guess it's the power to move people emotionally in a way they didn't quite expect. Well, I'm glad you took my advice and didn't let valerie's rejection slow you down. Oh, trust me. I realized early on in order to survive this business, you've got to have thick skin. One of steel around here. Maybe... But as I always say to tyler, you can't win if you don't try. I found the one! You did? Uh... What do you think? I don't know, ty. I think we might need to get a crane to put this in our place. But you said I could pick out whatever tree I want. I know, sweetie, but-- but this is a scotch pine. Okay, this is a sturdy choice. These originated in europe, and they're known for their excellent needle retention. How do you know so much about christmas trees? Well, I shot a piece about the top 10 christmas trees of the season, and this tree placed 9th. Which came in first? This guy right here. The forest spruce. And legend has it, it was the first christmas tree that was chopped down in the black forest. And you want to know what? Kris kringle chopped it down. Really? Yeah. This one right here. You don't think it's too small? Not to me. But it's your decision. I think I want this one. Well, okay, then. We have found our tree. But, you know what, I think I like the scotch pine one for the office. So, tyler... This is where mommy works. - cool. - it's pretty cool, right? A little help here. All right, so how does that look? Uh, crooked. It's leaning to the left. Okay, how about that? -Ty, how's that? -Your other left. -Right. -A little more. - There? - -a little more. There? -A little more. -A little more. -Yeah! -There. Perfect. All right... Okay... Well... I think my job here is done. Aren't you going to help us decorate it? That's up to your mom. Sure. Okay. good job! -a bit higher. -Higher? -Here? -Yeah. wow. I don't remember the office looking so festive last year. I know. It really warms the place up. I'm telling you, valerie, your real-life christmas miracle idea is a stroke of genius. The more I thought about it, I think that this actually has the potential to be an annual event. that's a great idea. Each year, we find a new miracle so it becomes a gift that just keeps on giving. It was the shot in the arm that this magazine needed. Brilliant. Brilliant concept, valerie. Thank you. Miss hennessy didn't pass on my real-life christmas miracle idea. She loved it! And valerie took credit for the whole thing. I'm so sorry, emma. It's not like I was naive enough to think that they were going to hand me the assignment. I would have settled for "nice job, emma." no, I get it. I get it. Why did she lie to me? I think it's because of miss hennessy's attitude around her lately has valerie feeling like that she's-- you know, that she has something to prove. This is just-- it's so disheartening. I agree, I agree, but I think, for your own sake, it's best if you just don't let valerie know that you're on to her. How? Have you met my face? It pretty much tells the tale. I'm being serious. Okay, if you don't want a pink slip under your christmas tree at the end of the month, play pretend. there you are. -Good morning, valerie. -Good morning. By the way, nice job on the christmas decor. It's make me feel a tad more jolly. I bet. I'm meeting with dennis in research, so if you could print out my phone sheet and-- and get you your iced coffee. On it. Thank you. How was that? You had me convinced. Look, dennis, the real-life christmas miracle I'm looking for doesn't have to be something as monumental as an organ transplant. It needs to be unique and it needs to be inspiring. We're a lifestyle magazine, not a medical journal. I get it. That's great. But I want to keep this under tight wraps. Just between us. Understood. I don't have to tell you how much pressure I'm under. Find me a true miracle and you'll be looking at the biggest christmas bonus of your career. I appreciate it. Valerie is in a meeting, but I'll give her the message when she gets out. Looks like your day hasn't gotten any brighter? It's been nothing but gingerbread and jelly beans. Well, cheer up, because I think I have a solution that you're going to love. -No thanks. -Wait. Hold on. Are you giving up so quickly? Actually, it's the opposite. I've decided my best hope of promotion is to prove my worth the month of December. And clearly, I've been doing something right. Hold on. Come on. Marcus-- it's not like I have a choice. I need this job. Maybe, okay? But you also look like you could use a break. Come on. I already sense a spin. Go ahead. Well, valerie stole your idea, right? So what's stopping you from stealing it back? I beg your pardon? Why not find your own story, somewhere in the city, and write about it? I mean, what better way to prove yourself than by delivering a more heartfelt christmas story than valerie for our big issue? Behind her back? She told you miss hennessy passed on your idea, so write it anyway. And prove to her that, despite your rejection, you let passion be your guide. You have an answer for everything, don't you? Tell me I'm wrong. You're the one that loves to write. Apparently. Why do I get the sense you're only encouraging me as a way to turn tables on valerie? Oh, I'm just trying to get you to write. At least tell me you'll think about it. Why are you so keen on pushing me to do this? You don't even know if I'm a good writer. If valerie stole your idea, you're a great writer. Where are you going? I just want to pop in and check on tyler. I'll be out in a minute. Okay. I'll be here. look, mom. Santa dean. thank you, folks. Ah, thank you. And with that, I am going to take a short break and... Warm up the old digits here. Pretty good, pretty good. Hi. Hello. That was very generous, santa dean. Well, I just come here to play music, not for the tips. People feel compelled to give me money anyway. Of course they would. Your music, it just has a way of uplifting our spirits. For both my son and I. Isn't that right, tyler? That's very kind. Very kind. Tyler, what's your favorite christmas song? Oh, come on, tyler. Tell santa dean your favorite christmas song. It's "silent night." oh, "silent night." he would be thrilled if you could play it for him. sure. I think I remember it. "silent night..." I'll do my best. -Hey, you two. -Hey. Looks like this place is turning out to be your favorite hang. Tyler likes coming here after camp. It cheers him up. And I could definitely use some of that after the day I had. I'm so sorry, emma. I still can't believe your boss did what she did. Taking credit for someone else's idea is just wrong. I know. As was telling myself I actually stood a chance for writing it. Well, if I were you, you know what I would do? Just that. Write it anyway. Really? That's what marcus from work told me to do. Marcus? So you've made a new friend? I guess. I mean, we started off a little prickly, but he seems to be my only ally at the office. So are you going to write it? I don't know. I just... I still feel a little torn. What for? If this temporary position of yours doesn't become something permanent, you'll need a fresh writing sample come the new year. True... But if valerie finds out, I don't want this costing me my job. Sounds to me like creating excuses to not write. Think maybe it's because you're a little scared to put yourself out there? My mom's not scared of anything. Right, mom? welcome back. Now, I have a special request from a young friend of mine named tyler. Thanks. How do you like that, ty? this place is really starting to feel like home, don't you think? Thanks, mom. I mean it. You always try to make me feel good. Aww, tyler... That is so sweet. You know when you say you're proud of me when I do something good? Yeah? Well, you make me proud. I do? I know it wasn't easy coming here. But you made it happen. I did. Didn't I? Thank you. For what? For making us both believe that anything is possible if you put your mind to it. I thought a lot about what you had to say. And I decided... I'm going to go for it. So now that you're onboard, where do we start? We? I thought I was writing this. You are-- you're writing it-- but your article is going to need a layout, which means you're going to need a photographer. Marcus, I don't even have a story. Details. Details, details. We'll find you a real christmas miracle. The real miracle is going to be me finding time to write a story. You know what they say... If you want something done, ask a busy person. Henry and carol, I'd like you to meet valerie masala. She's the lifestyle editor for the magazine. pleasure to meet you both. According to dennis, you have quite the tale to tell. We like to think so, yes. lovely earrings, by the way. Oh, thanks. I tend to get carried away this time of year. Yeah. Our friends call her "christmas carol." why don't you tell valerie what you told me this morning? Of course. Well, my wife and I both work as librarians at the city public library, and, well, carol's also a budding novelist as well. I've been toiling with my first novel for the better part of a year, but for some reason, I suffered a horrible case of writer's block. well, that was until we moved into this amazing turn-of-the-century craftsman over at curtis park. Underneath one of the floorboards, we came across an old book that looked like it had been tucked away for a century. It was a first edition of charles dickens, a christmas carol. Hand-signed by dickens himself, to his son, henry. My name is henry. not many people know this about dickens, but he was a big family man. Fathered ten children. And along with his literary works, he was also very passionate about philanthropy. This is where we both get a chill. Well, my wife and I work part-time at the city's children literacy program. Months ago, we learned cutbacks were going to threaten the program come January. Yeah. We quickly realized that we needed a miracle to save the program. And the proceeds from the sale of this book could help make that happen. We think it's what dickens would have wanted us to do. We're just hoping that our good fortune will help encourage others to rediscover the classics. So, what do you think? I think we have a real-life christmas miracle in the making. Okay... Easy there, tiger. All right, skating is all about balance. Got it? Oh! There you go! That's it! See, mom, it's not that hard. Maybe for you! This mama needs some training wheels. Hey, those are the kids from winter camp. You want to go over there and skate with them? Maybe in a little bit. I don't think I'm ready yet. okay, tiger. hey, marcus! Hey, what's up, man? This is a surprise. Yeah, well, I figured I'd squeeze in a little work with exercise. Why not, right? Your mom told me she was taking you skating today after work. You're looking pretty good on those blades. -Thanks. -Yeah. -Oh! -It's all about balance. I know, man. You're doing good. You're doing good. I'm trying to encourage him to go skate with the other kids. So, did you know when I was your age, my family moved, like, six times because my dad was in the service? -No way. -Way. And I realized really quickly that if let my shyness get in the way, then I wouldn't make any new friends. So what did you do? Well, I figured that I wasn't the only shy kid in the world, so I sought out other kids that were a little bit like me. And then? And then the easy part. You just walk up to them. And I said, "hey, I'm marcus." and then the rest takes care of itself. So what do you say? You want to go and skate with the kids? -Sure. -Sure? All right. hey, guys. Why couldn't I coax him to do that? It's just the message seems to land a little better when it's not coming from your mom. Well, thank you for that. you're welcome. So, seriously... Why did you come all the way out here? Oh, because I think I found our potential real-life christmas miracle. The artist's name is luca gianello. He is taking the art scene by storm. Okay, this one is actually called "a christmas miracle." come on, emma, the story practically writes itself. Marcus, stories don't write themselves. They need an emotional component to make them compelling. Okay, so find an angle and finesse it into your prose. I had a professor back in college who once said to me something I will never forget. He said if you want to be a great writer, you have to trust your gut. Let your inner voice be your guide and it will never lead you astray. Okay. So what is your inner gut telling you about our christmas artist? Okay then. Moving on. I know this can be frustrating, but you will see. My gut has never failed me. Okay, but we are chasing the holiday deadline, so is there any way to make your gut work faster? I just need the right inspiration. Okay. I got you. Thank you. Hey, buddy. so this is the exact spot where I was inspired to find my real-life christmas miracle. I see. So you're hoping that lightning will strike twice? Something like that. Look. They call him "santa dean." tyler and I have been coming down to listen to him play. There's something about him that has me keep circling back for some reason. what's so funny? You remind me of someone. You... My ex-girlfriend. But in a good way, in a good way. You have this innocent, guileless nature about you. It's charming. I can see your wheels spinning. I know. I guess I've always been sort of an open book. That's good. What about you? Total opposite, actually. I... Have a hard time opening up, but... I'm working on it. I think that's why the relationship ended. Any regrets? Not at all. Not at all. 'cause I think everything happens for a reason, right? In that case, there's someone I want you to meet. thank you, folks. Hi, santa dean. Hey, you're back again, huh? Yes, I wanted to bring my friend, marcus, out to hear you play. I really love your sound. Thanks, man. I wish I could play the piano. I can't even whistle yet. Oh, yes, you-- you know what, if your mother says it's okay, maybe santa dean can grant your wish. What do you think? What do you think? Yeah! come on over here. Sit down next to me. Take off your gloves. And where's your pointer finger? Okay, now, I want you to hit-- this is called a key-- when I point to it, all right? And you just touch it once. Ready? And... Good. Now we're going to go up... Bum, bum, bum, bum... Bum. good. Good, good, good, good. Good, good, good. Keep it up, keep it up. same one, right there. Good, good. You remembered that. Good. how'd you do that? -that's great! -I did it, mom! I can play the piano! You really are something. I have not seen him smile like this in a long time. He's a natural. He's got a great ear. There's a piano at the rec center. I'm going to practice tomorrow! You'd better. Santa dean, I don't know how to thank you. -No. Oh, gosh. No, no, no. Please, please, please. Watching a child's face light up while he's first discovering music... Is a gift for the giver. I can tell you really love it. And to play like that, you had to have played professionally? Well, you're very kind, but I'm just a retiree who likes to make some people happy in my time off. But your music... There's something about it that sounds so familiar. It's because I borrow from the greats. I'm going to continue playing my christmas music. Thanks for coming. I have to say that I wasn't expecting that. Definitely not. You think there's a story here? I do. The question is, what exactly is the story? he's playing for the love of sharing his music, but I get the sense he's hiding something. And I suppose this is your gut telling you that. Tell me I'm wrong. I wouldn't dream about it. It wouldn't even make a dent. I can see that you've already made up your mind. I have. Wow, you really are starting to get to know how to read me. Yeah. So, now that you've decided on your story, how do we get this to move along? I think dean will only shut me down if I approached him again. But someone in the park has to know something. So why don't you just go back tomorrow and ask around? what? Tyler's been sleeping on the couch ever since we moved here, but tonight... He decided to sleep in his own bed. Big boy. -Baby steps, right? -Baby steps. All right... I should go. Thank you, by the way. Tyler and I made these to share with the kids at the rec center. Do you want to try one? I guess valerie was right. The spread I shot encouraged you to try and bake the reindeer cookies for yourself. It's cute. Good! Think these are going to slay. Sorry I'm late. I wanted to stop by the bakery and pick up a few christmas treats. Good news, everyone. Miss hennessy is thrilled with the direction of our holiday christmas cover story. Care to share any details? Not until the exclusivity agreement is signed. Okay, karl, how are we doing with the piece on celebrity christmas traditions? I've already got three soap stars confirmed and we're out to an a-list star. Great. And, glenda, I want plenty of coverage at the celebrity parties that you e-mailed me. Annie and sarah, the preliminaries on the tri-city christmas competition is a real hoot. How do you feel about expanding it to a 750-word spread? -No problem. -Great. Okay, well, let's just keep this train on the tracks, people, and with the deadline looming, my presence will be a little less in the coming weeks, but emma will be my eyes and ears. Oh, and marcus. I love what you did with the christmas cookies. Glad to see you're putting in the extra effort. Thanks, valerie. Keep up the good, work. will do. The last time we got pastries, valerie got the exclusive with the royals. Yeah, barry's right. Valerie must have stumbled upon the biggest christmas story since rudolph. Hey... Is there anything on santa dean? Nothing other than he comes out to play after thanksgiving and christmas. Nobody seems to know anything else about him. Okay. Now that we know that valerie is off to the races, we have to up our game. Yep. tyler was thrilled. My friend, nancy, offered to take him christmas shopping tonight. So how long have you been doing the single mom thing? It's pretty much all I know. Tyler's dad is in international sales, so he's away constantly. Does he ever get to spend much time with him? We all make it work. Man... I wish I could see the world through your eyes. It's like you always find the good in people. And you don't? I'd like to say I try, but-- so, in your case, you are a work in progress. I like that. Whoa... I guess our street performer has a penchant for take-out. I wonder if anybody in the diner knows anything about him. You should go in there and ask around. Oh... Mm-mm. Emma, you can't write a story if you don't know who you're writing about. I know. It's just sneaky. Emma, you're not a girl scout. You're a journalist, remember? Why can't I be both? Do you think valerie would hesitate to go in? Probably not. But I am not valerie. Okay, I'll go. No, no, no, no, no. I'll do it. Excuse me. I'm sorry. That man who just left the diner... Not many people recognize him anymore. You must be a big jazz fan. My dad, actually. I know I've seen his face before. Maybe on one of his albums? His name is dean wannamaker. Of the wannamaker trio. That's it. Thank you very much. Well? Turns out your instincts were correct. I knew there was more to him than meets the eye. You were right. let's go! I don't want to be late for winter camp. Well, this is a change. Okay, then... Let's get a move on. Come on. I tracked down paul mulligan. The bassist of the dean wannamaker trio. Okay, and? And the last time they spoke was when dean vanished from the music scene ten years ago. Maybe the miracle element of my story is finding a way of reuniting the trio. Or finding out why they split in the first place. The good news is, paul was really eager to talk to us. What do you mean us? You, me and your camera, remember? Yeah. What caused dean to suddenly drop out of the jazz scene? Well, in the '70s and '80s, we had engagements all over the world, and... The pressures of life on the road put a strain on his marriage, and, ultimately, his divorce, when his daughter was just a young teen. He has a daughter? Yes. Cissy. He loved that little girl more than the world. After his divorce, their time together became less and less. And despite the fact that we were touring constantly, he always tried to maintain his presence in her life. By the time she graduated high school, cissy stopped returning his calls and his texts. I think something inside him just died. He lost the desire to perform, and... We tried reaching out to him, but... Paul, I'm so sorry. Thanks. I'm just glad that he's found a way to start performing again. Aside from the love for his daughter, music was his life. emma, you're a journalist. It's not your job to decide the outcome. It's not about the "story" anymore, marcus. Some things are more important. I think I need to find a way to help him. Listen, your heart's in the right place, okay? But don't you think it's a little dangerous for you to be getting emotionally involved? I think it's a little late. I knew you were going to say that. --go... Here. Jingle... quite the change, right? tyler? Tyler made a friend today. And you must be tyler's dad? Oh, no, this is marcus-- I'm a friend of the family. Oh. hey, mom, this is my friend, jacob. And this is our friend, marcus. He works with my mom. nice to meet you, jacob. nice to meet you. Looks like someone's turned things around. Do you think maybe tyler can over to my house for dinner tonight? I think that is a wonderful idea. -Yes! -Yes! ah, there he is. Okay... This is your shot. Wish me luck. You don't need it. You got this. Okay... Santa dean? Oh, hey. How are you? Hi. I was hoping we might have a word. Where's your son? He's on a play date. Okay. Dean, I have a confession to make. Okay. I'm not just a fan. I'm an aspiring journalist for the "daily lifestyle magazine." I know who you are... And what drove you away from the music scene. I can't imagine being separated from my child for as long as you have. How do you know this? I spoke to paul. He's worried about you. I think that if you'd let me tell your story, I might be able to help. Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Write this big expose about a washed-up jazz musician in the park playing for tips. No, no, no, that is not what this is about. You know, I think you're a very nice woman, and if you really want to help me... Leave me alone. Dean I'm just-- I'm just trying to help. Here... Call me if you change your mind. Dean. Dean... I'm so sorry to bother your again. Hey... Emma was drawn to you, okay, and it is for a reason. She set out to write a story about a real-life christmas miracle. Uh-huh? You are that miracle. -Me? -Yeah. Now, she's had to overcome a few hurdles to get to this point, and if I could help her, I would, but that's up to you. Why don't you give her a fancy by-line? Dean, can't you see it's not about a by-line for emma? It's about bringing a family together and making them whole again for christmas. That's what it's about for her. Maybe you were right-- maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved. Come on, don't start second guessing yourself now. Listen, okay, santa dean may have given up all hope on reuniting with his daughter, but your article may inspire him. You're right. And the fact is, santa dean is only half the story. -Right. -There you go. valerie. -Back from assignment? -Yes... I need you to schedule a photo shoot for the couple we're featuring on the cover story. Right away. And given the tight deadline, it'll be a working weekend for you both. Miss hennessy needs to approve the layout for the christmas issue Monday morning. Marcus, I need you to bring your a-game. That's all I've been bringing these days, valerie. Thank you. Looks like this weekend I'll be writing for my life. Yeah. Oh, um... What are you doing after work? Nothing, why? Tyler got invited by one of his new friends to go out caroling later. And I'm sure he would love it if you came. -Of course. -I mean, you don't have to. I know you're not the ho-ho-ho type of guy-- yeah, but I'm not a no-no-no type of guy either. So I'd love to. Great. It's a date! All right. I mean, no, not a date. -You know. -Yes. I-- -yeah, yeah. -Yeah. What? Nothing, man. I didn't say a word. I know. emma? After the staff meeting, I need graphics in my office to go over layout. Will do. Okay. so you're that marcus from the office that emma keeps talking about. yeah. thanks for taking her under your wing. I don't know about that, but... this move hasn't been easy for her. I can tell you've been sort of a life raft for the both of them. Hey, marcus, come sing with us! You guys are doing fine without me. aw, come on. Don't be shy. It's just one song. Okay. All right, so what do you say we sing "up on the rooftop"? -Great! -Okay. cissy, I know I'm stepping beyond the boundaries of being a journalist, but I was really moved by your father's story. Well, I'm afraid you're wasting your time. I have nothing to say to him. Okay, how about listening to what he has to say to you? I'm tired of his apologies. Growing up, he wasn't exactly parent of the year. Who is? As much as I would love to win that title, as a single mom, I can't help but think I am always coming up short. Trust me, even when we're trying our best, we make mistakes. I think it's those mistakes that help make us better parents. Come on, cissy. I have to imagine there had to have been some good memories, growing up with your dad? Christmas time? Summer vacation? I remember once he spent the whole weekend teaching me to play my first song on the violin. "silent night." I think it was because I was about to give up the instrument, and he wasn't going to let the daughter of a jazz great admit failure. I think it was much more than that, don't you? I think he saw a chance to share with you his passion for music. Clearly, something must have rubbed off. I'm sorry. I have to get ready for tonight's performance. So, I guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. I can tell there's a lot of hurt there, but at this point, she is refusing to budge. That's a shame, because guess who I caught coming to see her play tonight? Her number one fan. I bet he makes the pilgrimage just to hear her play. Yeah. Come on. Okay, let's get one more of carol holding up the book. okay. That's great. And, marcus, I want a series of close-ups on the book so I can see the inscription by dickens. of course. you must be very excited about what your story could do to put a spotlight on literacy programs? Oh, yes... Yeah, my wife and I are hoping it'll turn out to be a real win-win. Win-win? Oh, yeah. Carol's an aspiring novelist, so I can only imagine what a cover story's going to do to help launch her career. I mean, who knew this would turn out to be the best thing that's ever happened to us? Wow. Valerie's in a really good mood today. She actually complimented me on my work again. Weren't you the one to tell me not to let what valerie says go to my head? You're right. I'm only as good as my next shot. What did you think about them, by the way? The millers? Seemed nice enough. I guess. There's something about them that seems a bit off. Do I detect a note of jealousy? More like a symphony. I just wish santa dean was as much as an open book as the millers. Yeah, but I mean... Hey, at least you have a story to tell, right? Yeah... But my idea was to find a real-life christmas miracle. I didn't think my job would be to conjure one up. -What? -Nothing. You're just always so optimistic? It seems like nothing ever gets you down. I might seem that way, but trust me, I have my moments. and this is not one of them. What is it? I asked santa dean to call me if he changed his mind. -He's in! -What? Yes! -Yes! -We're in! Here we go! For the first time in longer than I care to recall, you looked like you were actually having fun. Emma sanderson, are you blushing? Don't be silly. Marcus and I are just friends. That's it. That's it, because you won't let yourself be open to more? Emma, I know you have a lot on your shoulders between work and raising tyler. But somewhere along the line, you deserve to make time to find your happy. I'm curious, what made you decide to talk to me? Well, watching you with your son, actually. There's nothing quite like that bond. I remember the moment cissy was born. They put her in my arms, and looked down in her eyes, and I promised myself that I would be the best father in the world. I think we all make that promise when we become parents for the first time. It's easy to say. So many things I wish I would do differently. You know, and then cissy... When she stopped all communication with me, it was like... Like I lost a limb or something. That's why you stopped performing? Hard to play the piano with one hand? When was the last time you had contact with your daughter? Her high-school graduation. I was supposed to make a speech, but the plane was delayed in london, so I missed... The whole ceremony. And we said things to each other we probably shouldn't have said, but... Then... Somehow, days turned into months, months turned into years, and... ...You know, unfortunately, I'm not a very good communicator. That's because you talk through your music. That's the way it's always been, I suppose. That's it! Why don't you perform a christmas eve concert in the park with the trio? Dedicate it to cissy and see if she comes. I don't know. She's a pretty stubborn girl. like her dad. But, hey, you-- you finally opened up to us. Dean, I know this is hard for you, but you need to take a leap of faith. This isn't about my story. This is about bringing you and your daughter together again. You can't win if you don't try. What are you doing in the office on a Sunday afternoon? Man, I know, right? Valerie got you working overtime as well? No, no, no. I finished the layout for the christmas carol couple. I'm working on the proofs for emma's story. Your second job. -I forgot. -Come on, man. She's really managed to press your reset button, hasn't she? -Who, valerie? I know. -Emma. Your whole attitude shifted almost the moment you two started working together. Oh, I wouldn't go that far. I mean, yes, her enthusiasm is a little infectious. It's more than that. She ignited a spark inside you. It's almost like you started caring again. Really? Mm-hmm. I guess I never really realized I stopped. where's tyler tonight? Aunt nancy has been begging me to let him go over to her place for a sleep over. Ah, okay. Nice. I mean, that we get to spend this time together. Yes. My alone time has been in short supply these days. Well, you must be really happy. Finally finishing the article, I mean. I think so. But... You should be the judge of that. wow, emma. I mean... I don't know what to say. I did not know you had this in you. I mean, the writing is so poetic... Everything is in there. Christmas. Family. Forgiveness. It has it all. Thanks, marcus, but the truth is, I wouldn't have gotten here if it weren't for you. Come on, come on. You're giving me way too much credit. No. You pushed me when I really needed to be pushed. I can say the same for you. I think santa dean will be very proud. I just hope my words convince cissy to give her dad a second chance. I mean, not just cissy. Emma... I wouldn't be surprised if this inspires everyone to do the same thing. When do you plan on giving it to valerie? First thing in the morning, before she makes her final presentation to miss hennessy. Good. Are you worried? I wouldn't be worried. It's not that. It's just... Something's been gnawing at me ever since the photo shoot with the millers. Gnawing? Like, how? Carol's husband was really eager to talk to me about how much this story would launch his wife's writing career rather than save the city's literacy program. So? I mean, that is a big aspect of her story. I went online tonight to see how much the first signed edition of a christmas carol goes for. Okay... It's less expensive than you think. A few thousand dollars would be a small investment against a potential book option. That's a big leap to make, don't you think? Maybe. My instinct is just telling me there's something off. Maybe this whole thing is a hoax? Valerie's a seasoned journalist. I am sure she had her sources check out their story. Details like this are hard to prove, which is why I'm going to share my suspicions with her in the morning. Whoa, whoa. I wouldn't. I wouldn't do that if I were you, emma. I mean, that could backfire on your own story. Well, I'll just have to take that chance. This could end her career. So? She took your idea, remember? Emma... It's not your job to save the world. Come on. I'm not trying to save the world, marcus. I'm trying to do the right thing. Emma... Well, this is a first, emma. I've never had my journalistic integrity questioned by anyone, let alone my own assistant. I'm not questioning your integrity, valerie. I'm just concerned that the millers may have played you from the start. And you're telling me this minutes before my meeting with miss hennessy? I only went online last night to discover how easy it is to pick up a signed edition of a christmas carol in the city. All it would take is a couple of phone calls to rule out the possibility. I've already had my fact checkers go over the story, so I'm afraid this ship has sailed. She's right, valerie. The story is a hoax. I spent the entire night searching the internet, and I found the exact same signed copy of a christmas carol that was purchased at a downtown gallery a week and a half ago. This must be a mistake. There's no mistake. It's the same signature on the book that I photographed with the millers. Well, I guess I have the both of you to thank for delivering this unsettling news. No, actually, it's emma you have to thank. I was a little slow on the draw. It's a mistake that I'll never make again. well, that's all fine and grand, but this revelation has left a gaping hole in my morning presentation for miss hennessy. Not necessarily. I don't know what to say, valerie. You've exceeded my expectations. Actually... It's my staff that did that. And our cover story, written by emma sanderson, layout by marcus welsh. This story... Has all the warmth and the heart that our readers look forward to in a holiday issue. But it's not really a completed real-life christmas miracle, is it? Not yet, but with any luck, it will be... When cissy shows up at santa dean's christmas concert. Well, that's your first assignment. You are going to have a very bountiful career with us here at daily lifestyle magazine. Really? Thanks, miss hennessy. You're welcome. And marcus... I am so inspired by your work. It's so poignant. It's beautiful. Thank you. The two of you make the most incredible team. I think so. congratulations. And everyone... Thank you. And merry christmas. merry christmas. I don't know how to thank you both. Obviously, there's no excuse for my behavior. With miss hennessy's faith on the wane with this year's christmas issue, I honestly regret what I did. And, marcus, I know I've been hard on you. There's no excuse for my being ill-tempered and critical. I only push you because I know what you're capable of. And as for you, emma... I should have been upfront and honest with you from the start. I hope you can accept my apology. Of course. After what I did, I'm not sure I would have come to my rescue. Maybe not right away, but deep down, I know you'd do the right thing. I really would like to believe that. Thank you. Merry christmas, you two. -Merry christmas. -Merry christmas. So... What made you decide to come running to my rescue? Well, I promised you that I would trust your gut. I just wish you would have given me a little more time before you stormed off. My story might have had a different ending if you didn't come around. So thank you, marcus. Emma... - I... congratulations. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. marcus is here! merry christmas eve! Merry christmas eve to you, too. So I got you and your mom a little something. You want to open it? It's a picture of us, mom! Marcus... I don't know what to say. It's just something for you both to remember your first christmas in the city. Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means to me. You're welcome. All right. So I guess we better head off to santa dean's christmas concert, huh? here, I'll get it. Hi. I have a special delivery for a tyler sanderson. That's me! Thanks! merry christmas! thanks, mom! This isn't from me, baby. "dear tyler, thanks for coming out to hear me play. If you ever need a teacher, you know where to find me. Merry christmas, santa dean." you kept your promise! I did? This really is the best christmas ever! Sweetheart. I gotta tell you, dean, yesterday's rehearsal was just like the old days. Well, I'm sorry I shut you guys out all those years ago. But you know me, words are not my strong suit. Under the bridge, old friend. Under the bridge. Hey, dean, any word from cissy? No, not yet. Well, it's christmas eve, right? Anything's possible... Anything is possible, and I'm hoping for a christmas miracle. I hope you're as proud of yourself as I am for you. thanks, nancy. I would just feel a little bit better if cissy showed up. The issue hit stands about a week ago. tyler and marcus seem to be getting along nicely. I'm starting to realize just how much he misses a male presence in his life. Maybe not so much anymore. Any sign of cissy? I just have to believe that love will always triumph. hello! Hello! Thank you for coming out on this chilly, chilly christmas eve to welcome back our little trio. This marks the first performance for the the dean wannamaker trio in over a dozen years. thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. We're going to dedicate tonight's performance to my daughter, cissy wannamaker. You know, christmas is a time for hope. Letting go of the past, living in the moment, and a hope for a brighter future. I've been living a life with a heart filled with... Regret. I let hope die. Until I met someone who opened my eyes, and... She showed me that it's at those times that you need hope most of all. So, cissy, wherever you are, daddy loves you. Now and forever. Okay, you want to hear some music? --yeah? my angel. Merry christmas, daddy. Come over here. Are you gonna play with me? you did a very good thing here. No, we did. Yeah. Emma, spending this time with you lately has really opened my eyes in a way I never could have imagined. How so? Well, you got me believing in love again. Or at least starting to. That's something I never thought possible. You are a work-in-progress, remember? yes, yes... But this work-in-progress is falling for you. And I hope that you might just feel the same way as well. well... Trust your gut. It will never lead you astray. I think you just found your happy. Yeah... I think I did.
