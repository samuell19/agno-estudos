It's rainy, it's cold, but look at all the excited faces. A lot of these folks from Renton here, ponchos, smiling, even though it's raining. And we talked about the team effort for this.

One Dow stock is skyrocketing, and it's a familiar one. Shares of Boeing stock is on pace for its best month ever. I'm speaking to you from the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington, because at this plant, they're building the plane of the future. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! -U.S.A. -U.S.A.! U.S.A.! We're the leader in this great global industry, and we know that lives literally depend on what we do. We will continue to lead and succeed in our second century. I believe in the Boeing mission. I'm awed by their technology and their prowess. I love it. And it's a hugely important company, and I want it to succeed.

Maybe you could've stopped the second crash." ♪ ♪ An Indonesia passenger plane crashing into the sea minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. All 189 people on board are now feared dead. ♪ ♪ Mentioned this was a-a Boeing aircraft. What m-more do we know about the plane? Boeing, as you said, uh, almost brand-new. They had taken delivery of it back in August. It was a 737 MAX. That's the updated version of the 737. They haven't been out that long. The stock is down, but my read is that TheStreet actually isn't that negative on where Boeing is going with this issue. Analysts have great expectations for their stock. The company said the crash had posed no material risk to the MAX program, the company has enough cash flow to cover this, and that this issue again is overblown. First of all, I think it's important that we all express our sympathies for the-the loss of, uh, Lion Air Flight 610. Uh, we've been very engaged with the investigative authorities throughout in providing all of the information, uh, necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of, uh, of the situation. And the bottom line here is the 737 MAX is safe. We are following breaking news out of Ethiopia, where a plane went down, killing everyone on board. The airline told state media there were people of more than 30 nationalities among the dead. It's unclear what caused the crash, but the model in question, a Boeing 737 MAX 8, it's the same one that was involved in the Indonesian disaster back in October. This has now moved into a criminal probe. The Justice Department issuing multiple subpoenas as part of a wide-ranging investigation into Boeing's FAA certification. Facing serious safety questions and brutal political headwinds, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is being grounded around the globe. Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded. Is this expected to send shock waves through the U.S. economy? It certainly could. You're talking about tens of thousands of supply chain workers. That's in addition to the 12,000 Boeing employees who build the 737. It was a big-- that was a big decision.

Going through the list of remains, viewing, like, what's in the casket. You know, it was hard to digest. The families of some of the 157 people killed when a Boeing 737 MAX crashed in Ethiopia last March have accused Ethiopian Airlines of denying them the chance to attend a service for their loved ones at the site of the disaster.

Two days before the burial, they send the families an email, saying, "We're going to be burying your loved ones in the next 48 hours."

We may actually be in litigation against Boeing out of this cris-- so I don't want to throw stones at Boeing until we know more. Boeing's got the best aviation lawyers, trial lawyers. They've got unlimited resources. And the families of the victims essentially have us. I was a pilot in the Marine Corps. I've been in two aviation crashes. The first one was in a DC-9. It broke in half when it landed in Pensacola. The second one, the cross-tube broke, the rotor blades hit the ground and flipped the helicopter. The accident I was in, nothing compared to the two MAX crashes. Those passengers didn't have a chance. So, on the 6th, we have Konjit. And then Linet. She has two hours to meet with you. There's two sides of the case, and they're both equally important. The first one is the liability case. She may not come now. She's all worried. Yeah, I saw the emails. Basically, we have to prove that Boeing did something wrong in order to hold Boeing accountable. She left behind a husband and two little-- and two minor children. But they haven't given me a date yet. The second thing is compensation. Even though life is precious and life can't be measured in terms of money, that is how the law measures it. And the compensation that we seek from Boeing has to reflect the very serious losses our clients have suffered. Boeing will try to put people on a spreadsheet. Hello. Have name, age, relatives. And then they might say, "Well, that's a single person, "not survived by a spouse, no kids. That case isn't worth a lot of money." So one of the things we do is we kind of take them off that chart. "Yeah, that person's not married, but did you know the person supported his entire family?" He completed all the six years training and then he become Africa key instructor. In this case, our client's a young man, who, in the entire country of Ethiopia, he's the only person who can actually instruct master technicians on Toyota vehicles.

Joining us now is Dominic Gates, an aerospace reporter for The Seattle Times. Behind me here, we've got the 737 fuselage system installation. This is the most journalistically competitive story I've ever worked on. Sorry, everybody. Sorry I'm late. And so every meeting we were having... You know that a lot of people are gonna be reading it or not... The editors were saying, "Whatever you got, get it out there fast." There are two great centers of airplane building in the world: Toulouse in Europe for Airbus and Seattle for Boeing. Historically, you did pay a premium for a Boeing plane. And that's because it was better built. I don't think that's true anymore. I mean, it-it began with the McDonnell Douglas merger in 1997. The merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas is now complete. And, in a sense, the MAX crashes are the end point of that. All these McDonnell Douglas people came with this different mentality. They didn't want to design new planes and just harvested the money from these older models. The new management sold Wall Street this vision of Boeing growing exponentially, and Wall Street bought it. But they were also under intense competitive pressure from Airbus. -Yeah. -That's right. Airbus kept building new planes, and suddenly American Airlines was about to seal a huge order for 200 A320neos, which is the rival of the 737. Is Boeing in trouble, do you think? It tells us that the-the company's in some trouble in its competition with Airbus. American Airlines was a legacy Boeing customer who only flew, uh, Boeing products up to that time. So the idea that they would lose market share to, um, Airbus was a major event. So what's Boeing going to do to answer Airbus? They were going to design a whole new airplane, and then scrapped those plans and decided to modify -the 737 in that race. -Right. And the thinking for that was time, - money? - Time. It's a lot easier to get a new version of a already certified aircraft certified by the FAA. But the primary goal was that Boeing wanted to produce the airplane so they could sell it to customers who were already flying the 737 and say, "Look, if an airline is looking at either buying an Airbus, "where they'd have to put pilots through training, "or buy the 737 MAX, where they already have the pilots certified, that's a huge competitive advantage." The biggest picture of all is really the expectations in a capitalist society, right? There's shareholders, who want greater return all the time. There are flying passengers, who want lower prices all the time. That's really what drives all of this. Pull the curtain back and see what's really going on in this company, and you'll understand why this plane crashed. Over here, this was not supposed to be a big parking lot for 737s, but that's what it's become right now where they're grounded. It's, uh, heartbreaking. The 737 factory, it's a huge facility. My team worked on the factory floor, and we started seeing a lot of quality issues. And that's when I was expressing my concerns to the general manager. ♪ ♪ Problems started when senior executives were really trying to ramp up production of the MAX. The plan is to build these planes in a very organized way 'cause it's a complicated product and you have to do everything right. And because of this pressure, this continued pressure to produce, because of Airbus, we're not doing that. We're seeing a lot of, uh, narrow-body interest, so of course, uh, this week, we'll be highlighting the MAX family. Cameras captured a great week for Boeing in orders and commitments. Singapore Airlines has committed to 30, United Airlines to 20. The MAX was very successful. It's the fastest-selling Boeing jet ever. We got about 4,000 737s in backlog. We're oversold. We were going from building 47 planes in a month to 52. That's a lot of airplanes. Every one and a half seconds, a 737 takes off - somewhere in the world. - Right, and... - So, there goes another one. - All right. - So we would try to meet schedule, and-and it started slipping. AerCap announced an order for 100 737 MAX 8s. Well, it's looking pretty good. Looks like, uh, another record year. Now we're having to do work out of sequence, which adds risk. Take a look at shares of Boeing. Over the next 20 years, we see a need for about 41,000 new airplanes. I'm about ready to move again. So I just move my pad, and I have to keep pace, keep up. I've never seen that kind of pressure put on people. And they started getting grilled, you know, "How-- "I thought you gave me your word you were gonna be done yesterday, and your team-- How come you're not off the plane?" And somebody would make this mistake, and then the same mistake would be made a day or two later. Y-You don't want people thinking like that when they're building airplanes. I wrote a letter to the CEO saying, "We could still do the right thing, but we need to stop and give our people a chance to catch up." I wrote to the board of directors, and I requested their assistance. "Yeah, we'll get in touch with you." "We'll get back to you." Nothing, nothing. We'll meet this demand, always raising the bar when it comes to safety, quality and integrity.

Those are the names that you hear about, but there are many other whistleblowers trying to speak out to make a difference. Doing okay, honey? I'm doing okay. Ed's going up against Boeing, one of the biggest employers in Seattle area, and there are some very well documented examples where Boeing has retaliated against people who have gone against the company. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. Going down here. Down here? -CYNTHIA McFADDEN: Hi. -Hi. How are you, Cynthia? Thank you for coming and doing this. Thanks for inviting me. Appreciate it. Very good. So let's, um, let's ask the documentary team to go. So, the name's out. The Wall Street Journal is the one who got the leak. Right. Someone leaked Ed's identity, and now the press are calling Boeing, and Boeing is preparing to say something. I can't answer questions like that ever on behalf of the client, whether the answer is yes or no. People want to protect Boeing's flank. They think it's in their interest to have Boeing get out there first before Ed's story is told. But of course, I know you don't want to do that. In order for that not to happen, um, looks like the stories will go today rather than tomorrow. I'm trying. Never a dull moment. McFADDEN: After 30 years in the military, much of it spent in an airplane, Ed Pierson has a strong sense of duty. Bottom line is you're worried about people dying in Boeing planes. Yeah, absolutely. McFADDEN: But in late 2017, Ed Pierson says he started to see things that alarmed him. What words would you use to describe that factory at that point? Dangerous. Um, unnecessary. Taking unnecessary risks. Chaotic. Uh, um, disarray. McFADDEN: Four months later, a Lion Air 737 MAX crashed, killing all 189 people on board. What do you say to Americans who are planning to fly on a 737? I would demand that the FAA, in their role as regulators, go in, thoroughly investigate that factory. So, Cynthia, what is Boeing saying about all this? McFADDEN: Well, Lester, while the 737 MAX fleet are all grounded, there are more than 6,800 other 737s flying. Now, Boeing is pushing back strongly tonight, saying that the 737 is one of the safest planes flying, and they say, quote, "...the suggestion by Mr. Pierson of a link between his concerns and the recent MAX accidents is completely unfounded." And they say, so far, no investigators have found, quote, "...production conditions in the factory contributed to the accidents." Lester. PETER DeFAZIO: After the first crash, Boeing told us it was a one-off. The initial reports on the second crash sounded identical to what happened in the first crash. And that just set off alarm bells with me, saying, "No, wait a minute. Uh, there's something we don't know here." And that was when we began the investigation. Almost like a court proceeding, we-- first you go into discovery. You need the documents. And then, once you get the documents, you identify, uh, key players who need to be interviewed. Morning. Good morning. Good to be here with you this morning. Uh, thank you. Looking forward to, uh, today's hearing. They're gonna ask you, apparently, about a manager who sought to halt the production of the 737 MAX today. Did you know about anything like that? And what would your response be to that now? Aware of that, and we've, uh, taken on those concerns and address-- have addressed those. Thank you. Thank you. DeFAZIO: I want to return to the market pressures, the fact that you had to design a plane that was more economical and couldn't require pilot training. I was taking on a very powerful corporation. Mr. Chairman, we'll follow up with that information. DeFAZIO: They were resistant. Is anybody at Boeing taking a cut or working for free to try to rectify this problem? My, uh, board will conduct a comprehensive review that's... So you're saying you're not giving up any compensation at all? You're continuing to work and make $30 million a year? DeFAZIO: But we're gonna see through with the investigation. We think the system is gonna work. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg testified before a Senate committee. Boeing came to my office shortly after these crashes and said they were the result of pilot error. Those pilots never had a chance. When we design a system, understand that these airplanes are flown in the hands of pilots, and in some cases, our system safety analysis includes not only the engineering design but also the actions that, uh, pilots would take as part of, uh, a failure scenario. Blame the dead pilots. I-I'm continually astonished that Boeing won't move from that. Especially once I started digging up information about the MAX's new flight control system, which is called the MCAS-- the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. Hey, it's Dominic. Uh, you got a minute? The name of it is an awful acronym that tells you nothing. I find it astonishing that you don't know about it. All we knew early on was that MCAS was new flight control software that had been added to the MAX and that some flaw in it had caused the crash. There's a big question about how this airplane was designed. The history of this is freaking crazy. So the whole thing goes way back to, like, the '60s. Newest arrival in the Boeing family of airliners, the 737 attracts a crowd. They want a short jet. They want a jet that people can get onto and off of on a stairway, so they build the 737 low to the ground. So then, fast-forward to 2011... ...they tacked on two new engines. The size of the engines meant they're gonna be dragging on the ground, so they put them forward and up. The new engines are so big that the air gets underneath and gives it an extra bit of lift, so software automatically counters that. A sensor feeds the flight control computer, and MCAS swivels the tail, pushing the jet's nose down. But the system was just too strong. Before the first crash, the pilot began a fight against this system that he didn't know about, pulling the nose up, and he did it 26 times. And the plane was going in a roller-coaster ride. Flight 892 is... I actually talked to pilots, and they had a totally different story. Before the second crash, Boeing sent a senior vice president down to American Airlines to brief the pilot union. And that turned into a pretty rough meeting. I wasn't going to stay in the meeting. It was the first time Boeing visited APA headquarters. When we saw the list of the Boeing personnel coming, the one thing that really jumped off the page was they were bringing their lawyer, so... I mean, who brings a lawyer to a safety meeting? I just sensed that they were not being direct or forthright. So, anyway, I just thought it would be beneficial to record the meeting. So I-I guess what I'll start with, then, is the control law that is referred to in the press right now called MCAS. So it's just a little bit of software in the flight control system. Obviously, in the accident a couple of weeks ago, it's been reported that the system misbehaved. I keep hearing those words, "little," "little bit," "misbehave." It was like they were describing it as a child. You know, a million miles you're going to fly this airplane, and maybe once you're going to see this ever. So we try not to overload the crews with information that's unnecessary. And I don't know that understanding this system would have changed the outcome of this. They didn't come in and go, "Look, "you've only got a handful of seconds to get this right. "Okay, we didn't tell you about it. We're very sorry. "But we want you to know going forward that if you react quickly and get on this, that it's manageable." They didn't. They were like, "Look, you know what to do." Just minutes from now, lawmakers on Capitol Hill will hear from pilots who have criticized Boeing in the wake of these two deadly crashes. I know Sully will be the movie star in the room, but really look for Dan Carey. He's the head of the Allied Pilots Association. As pilots know, improvements in aviation are often-- too often-- written in the blood of the unfortunate victims of these airplane accidents. I got a subpoena from Congress, so I released the tape. I knew there would be some pretty heavy consequences. This audio recording, more than anything else, has raised the specter of doubt about the company and this aircraft. This is the first unscripted moment we have heard from Boeing. It was important for me to get that tape out, and then I immediately turned it over to Chairman DeFazio. DeFAZIO: There were many false warnings simultaneously? Yes. A single fault, a single failure can now have cascading effects rapidly through multiple systems. Do you think that better trained pilots should've been able to handle the malfunctions? You have to remember, uh, sir, and members of the panel, this is a sudden, violent and terrifying event. This airplane's pitching up and down, rapidly and violently. There's bells, uh, warnings and clackers, uh, sounding. Again, the failure was that they didn't ever tell us the system existed, so therefore we did not have robust training. I'd like first, the family members who are on, that they could unmute themselves and introduce themselves so that the media knows who is, uh, who's on. Suzanne Camp. I'm the mother of Micah Messent.

Like seeing the ground coming toward you so close. ♪ ♪ Tonight, a rare and stark admission of fault from the world's biggest airplane maker. We at Boeing are sorry for the lives lost in the recent 737 MAX accidents. The Boeing argument was, "We've informed everybody how to handle it, and we're working on a software fix which we will have very soon." Boeing says MAX pilots can learn the new system in just 30 minutes. That's-that's just ridiculous. We're taking a comprehensive, disciplined approach and taking the time to get the software update right. We're nearing completion and anticipate its certification and implementation on the 737 MAX fleet worldwide in the weeks ahead. We remain confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 MAX. People think that the problem was only software, but Boeing is controlling the narrative: "Look here. Don't look here." It's easier for them to talk about pilot training, 'cause they can blame it on human mistakes, and the software, 'cause we'll just make a software patch and we'll send it out, you know, but there's other issues, unanswered questions that are not being addressed. Why did the plane crash? It crashed 'cause the pilots lost control. Why did the pilots lose control? 'Cause MCAS software was pitching the plane down repeatedly. Why was that happening? 'Cause the angle of attack sensor failed. But why'd the sensor fail? People think it's software, but it's actually hardware. It's a three-pound physical part that's been installed on hundreds if not thousands of planes. The angle of attack is the angle basically between the wing and the incoming airflow, and the angle of attack sensor was giving a wrong signal. In fact, it was giving an impossible signal. 74.5 degrees nose up. Isn't 74 degrees, like, beyond the pale of any normal... You're right. An airplane can't fly at 74.5 de-- You'd have to be a rocket ship. So even though the plane was flying at a safe angle of attack, because of this bad sensor, the MCAS system thought it was higher up like that and was programming the nose to go down. If this was truly the-the angle of attack, they've got... - Bigger problems. - They got way bigger problems. The MAX was not the only plane being built at the factory. Makes you wonder: Are there other sensors out there that have the same defect? And so, if that's all they're gonna do-- fix the software and the pilot training-- then I think the flying public needs to ask why. Whistleblowers from inside Boeing stepping forward has always been my best source of information. Over the years, that's how I've learned what's really going wrong inside the company. I'm for the little guy. I'm not for-- obviously, for the large, powerful corporation. So-- That I know has severe problems internally. Gerry Eastman approached me in 2003, years before the MAX crashes, angry about how management was running the company into the ground and about safety issues. My boss had this meeting with me and told me not to do my job, to just stamp the paperwork off. Of course, I knew that was bogus. He had access to documents he wasn't supposed to have access to, but he did. I mean, you're talking about the second biggest defense contractor in the United States with big cyber capabilities. And this machinist was logging in to the presentations of the CEO and giving them to me. I repeatedly told Gerry, "Look, be careful." He just completely ignored me. Eastman worked for Boeing for 18 years. He was arrested at his desk. He's been charged with computer trespassing, and, if convicted, he faces up to four years in prison. Anybody who worked at Boeing who talked to me privately is breaking the company rules and is in serious trouble. Gerald Eastman was in King County court today for his arraignment, where he pleaded not guilty. He says Boeing was not taking his safety concerns seriously and that is why he went public with what he found. You know, I got together, you know, and said to my wife, I said... "I have to go public, you know, so-- regardless of the threat to me." After he was arrested, he settled with Boeing and he never worked in aerospace again. I didn't hear from him in a long time, and I wondered, "What's going on?" I was worried. Later, I learned from a friend of his that he had taken his own life. Do you ever look back and say, "I wish I would've just kept my mouth shut"? No. There's-there's thousands of people like-- at Boeing that do that every day, and some of us have to step forward. ♪ ♪ I'm anxious. We have friends and family that work or have worked at Boeing, and-and my dad worked at Boeing after he retired from the Navy as well, and we felt proud to be part of that. And so this is hard 'cause you feel like you're squealing. And I know it's not. He's not. He's just trying to shed light on something that can be made better and safer. But I'm hoping that people understand the reasons behind why he's doing this. It would be different if you knew this was a one-off, this is it, this is the last time this would happen. But there's the angst and anticipation for another crash to happen. This first six minutes of every flight are extremely difficult. Not just for me but for all the families. Every time there's turbulence, the first thought is, "Is this the end? "Like... am I gonna die?" But my dad would go anywhere for me. That's why I have to go. To make sure that the world knows planes are not as safe as we think they are. ♪ ♪ Folks, we'd like to welcome all of you to Washington, D.C. So glad you're here. -Good to see you. -Yeah. -We made it, guys. -Yeah. -Yeah. We made it. I've met so many families from 35 different countries. We see the same pain in each other's eyes. While all your lives moved on, for the last six months, our lives, the lives of the families of the victims has not moved an inch. Grief, loss and pain are a universal language that everybody speaks. Grief has been, uh, profound, and, uh, I feel best when I'm outdoors. My daughter was a... a conservationist. And I know that was her, um, happy place. And I think that the way that we can fight for their legacy... ...is to make sure that no other family is in the same position as we are. DeFAZIO: The families, they're critical, putting a face on these crashes. Since the plane was built here, since the plane was certified here, they knew that they had to focus on the United States government and on Boeing to fix this problem. It was quite evident that things were rushed. In fact, they were continuing to make the airplanes after the second crash. That's the biggest slap in the face to every single family. My mission out of this is to make sure that, when people get on a flight, that they get off on the other side. There's a lot of, lot of, lot of things swirling around in my head. It's... It has been a-- I have-- it's been-- I've been obsessed by it, and I-I didn't really intend to be. I'm not-- I don't consider myself... That's the first time I've heard you say that. Well, I know I've been obsessed with kind of-- 'cause I want to, you know... ...make sure it never happens again. So... ♪ ♪ I still have nightmares, but fighting back has been a powerful motivator. - I mean, I'm finally getting it, but... - Just one more step. Yeah. I know. I'd like to think that the families know that there's people out there that are still trying to get to the truth. Today, appearing before the House Transportation Committee is a Boeing whistleblower, Edward Pierson. Pierson says he thinks that production problems contributed to the MAX crashes. We need answers, we need accountability, and we need someone to take responsibility. The reporters will try to question you. They'll shout questions at you that'll be provocative. Don't respond to it. You're gonna do this right now? Guys, if you could give him some space, that would be great. Can we just have a moment? Yeah. Why did the FAA not... - You're gonna have to ask them... - We're coming in. My name is Ed Pierson. I would first like to provide my heartfelt condolences for all the families and friends who lost loved ones on Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Your loss and grief are truly unimaginable. I believe production problems at the Renton factory may have contributed to these two tragic crashes. I formally warned Boeing leadership in writing on multiple occasions, specifically once before the Lion Air crash and again before the Ethiopian Airlines crash, about potential airplane risk. Those warnings were ignored. On June 9, 2018, while the Lion Air airplane was being produced, four months before it crashed, I wrote an email to the 737 general manager advising him to shut down the production line. When I mentioned that I've seen operations in the military shut down for lesser safety concerns, I will never forget his response, which was, "The military isn't a profit-making organization." Less than a month later, on March 10, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed, killing 157 people. The U.S. regulators' investigation of these crashes has been as disappointing as Boeing's insistence that it had no systemic quality or safety issues. Thank you again for providing me this opportunity. I'm ready to answer your questions. Okay. I recognize, uh, Representative Norton. Would you favor the FAA going farther and doing an investigation of U.S. Boeing factories? I fully support that. I was there for three years, and-and honestly I never saw-- I never met an FAA employee in my three years. And I never actually remember any of my employees saying they talked to an FAA employee. Now, they may have been there, but they certainly weren't visible and present. And I-I really think that's necessary. Uh, I'm gonna suggest that, uh, as, uh-- following this hearing. It is gonna be on us if we do not take the steps to systematically look at Boeing factories across the United States. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ♪ ♪ DeFAZIO: The Federal Aviation Administration, they are tasked with the job of keeping the public safe and, uh, making sure that things that we certify to fly are gonna fly and not crash. Administrator Dickson, you're our hope. You are our hope. Aviation's hard lessons and the hard work in response to those lessons have paved the way to creating a global aviation system with an enviable safety record. But we recognize that safety is a journey, not a destination, and we must build on the lessons learned, and we must never allow ourselves to become complacent. Thank you, and I'm happy to take your questions. Mr. Dickson, um, do you know who Ed Pierson is? Uh, I have not met him personally, but I know, I know of him. -He's sitting right over there. -Yeah. I mean, are you aware that four months before the first crash, he brought these problems to Boeing's attention? Are you aware of that, gentlemen? -Four months before the first crash. -I know that there were, uh, con-- yes, that, uh, that concerns were raised, yes. That's right. And you know what they did? They sat on it until a second plane crash. That's what happened. A bunch more people lost their lives. So my question to you is: Will you investigate the production problems at the Renton facility? Uh, I know that there's ongoing activity through our-our, uh, our oversight. Sir, sir, I'm sorry, that's not good enough. Are we gonna interview the production workers at the Renton facility? Is it gonna be a real thing? You have my commitment that we are looking into those problems and we will continue to do so. Will you commit, as we sit here today, that you will interview Mr. Pierson? Absolutely. Will you, will you investigate -the production problems at the Renton facility? -Yes. The committee stands adjourned. Thank you so much. That took courage. You're doing the right thing by making sure it gets fixed and no other family has to go through this. Thank you. Thank you. -Thank you very much, sir. -Yeah. Thank you. If you could give him some space, that would be great. Happy to-- if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them for you, but I think that's all for today. Well, nobody wants to fly on those planes. That was really amazing. The FAA just got directed to go and-and investigate the factory. And, yeah, this was a big win. The story we are following tonight: Boeing has fired its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. Muilenburg had presided over one of the worst years in Boeing's history. 346 people died. Can you answer a few questions? How much did he walk away with? $62.2 million. That may sound like a lot, but he's not taking his 2019 bonus. But the new guy, the new CEO, David Calhoun, he will be making 1.4 million with the added benefit of making millions more in bonuses, including seven million-- just seven million alone-- if he gets the MAX back in the air. And since we're talking about... There is no remorse in this for Boeing. Just financial targets. And I think for me, thinking about Muilenburg and my dad, knowing they were two men born the same year, one is living a lavish lifestyle with millions of dollars, and the other paid for it with his blood. ♪ ♪ So the FAA is under fire, and I think rightfully so, but it's crazy because the-- Boeing's main defense is that it can't be liable because the airplane is certified by the FAA. Every plane that's ever crashed has been certified. -Right. -So that kind of answers the question, uh, no, certification is not safety. The FAA's position is that the certification standard should provide immunity to-to the manufacturer, but the FAA's position also is that manufacturers, their responsibility extends beyond just meeting the certification standards. If the only pressure on your profit margin is legal liability, and if you remove the risk of legal liability, because once it's certified, you're no longer going to be able to be sued by people who are killed or injured by your aircraft, there's no longer any motivation for the aircraft companies, for the designers, the manufacturers, to design anything safely. The only motivation is to design something that's certifiable. It doesn't really make sense. Then there is no-- there's no safety for the flying public. - We got to go. - Yeah, we got to go. - Okay. - All right, babe. -Okay. -I will call you when we can, -and we'll-- Okay. -Good luck. Love you. Naively, I thought that he would do his bit at the hearing and then it would be over, and so not the case. And it-- I mean, it literally dawned on me that moment like, "Oh, my God, this is not the end of it. We're just, we're just... This is the tip of the iceberg." And that's exactly what it was. ♪ ♪ Finally got the interview with the FAA. Now I'm going to tell them what was going on in the factory. I think that's it, that giant facility down there. - Yeah. - I believe. ♪ ♪ That's my source. I'll see you later. This source approached me in 2007. At the time, I actually met with half a dozen FAA safety engineers. You know, I'm not taking my usual car because some sources that I've worked with have been followed. I give them a number of a burner phone that I bought with cash so that the phone's untraceable. Nobody here yet. The thing that really jumps out for me is, during the interview, I was always giving them examples of production problems that I was seeing in the factory, one of the gentlemen would lit-literally finish my-my thoughts. And as I said, you know, "And-and then this led to," and he would, he would actually finish my statement. So either the FAA did know and they didn't do anything about it or they didn't know and it's inexcusable how they could not know. And-and I-- the part I can't get past my brain is, you know, you have 45,000 FAA employees, you have 1,600 of them in that building that we were at, and they can only assign five people 15 minutes away down the street at the busiest factory in the world? I mean, give me a break. I just hope that they do what they say they're gonna do and go back and do a deeper investigation and... It's-it's gonna require someone to force them to do it, I-I worry. ♪ ♪ Thanks for coming. Yeah. In terms of change at the FAA, is there a culture shift as a result of what happened on the MAX? Have people's attitudes changed? One of our engineers turned in a safety report, and the manager was upset. Because now you've got a delay in the program, and it's all going to impact the program's schedule, and managers retaliate. And so the people that I talk to said that they have not seen any change. There's some real problems with the organization. In all fairness, we went through ten years of just absolutely amazing safety level. But then there was a lot of complacency, both in industry and at the agency. And Boeing has huge influence politically. A lot of money put into lobbying Congress. And it just shows the acceptance of the Boeing... the Boeing position on things, because the agency and Congress, they are focused on enabling industry, and I think the belief system is that is safe enough. ♪ ♪ The wall between the FAA and the industry is a very low wall. There's-there's a lot of back-and-forth movement. It really often is a revolving door. People who work for Boeing, who then go into the FAA. You also see people at the FAA looking to go into Boeing. And what ends up happening is the FAA really becomes part of the Boeing team. DeFAZIO: I was very frustrated by the FAA. They were way less cooperative than Boeing. They refer to the regulated entities as their customers. No, they're not your customers. They are a private interest that sometimes will cut corners to get a competitive edge. And sometimes those corners they cut kill people. During this investigation, we found out something which I think changed everything. After the first crash was a report that the FAA had produced about the MCAS system. That report said that, unless the MCAS was modified, 15 of these planes will crash during the life of the fleet. We've never allowed anything like that into the air before in history. You don't do that. Who saw that report? How was it circulated? Why didn't they then act to ground the planes, as opposed to waiting until, uh, another plane full of people crash? After the first crash, they estimated 15 crashes in the lifespan of the plane. FAA leadership, Boeing leadership, they knew this before this plane was made, before it was put together, and they did nothing. That's what makes it so heartbreaking. When you realize, like, how preventable it was. ♪ ♪ This is gonna be a really interesting hearing. And this got to go here. ...of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. There we go. The aircraft involved in both accidents was the Boeing 737 MAX. It is hard not to conclude your team at the FAA has attempted to keep us in the dark. Administrator Dickson, I hold you responsible for this. I expect to receive an explanation today at this hearing for the failure to comply -with the committee's request. -Yeah, just make some excuses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I-I always appreciate the opportunity for dialogue. I will not sign off on this aircraft until all FAA technical reviews are complete. I also intend to pilot the aircraft myself before the FAA makes any ungrounding decision. There we go. Just bravado. You got pi-- you have test pilots. You don't have to fly it yourself. Talk about j-just tone-deaf. Senator Markey. Boeing is now arguing in court that the FAA's certification of the 737 MAX should shield it from liability. Do you support Boeing's position, or should the victims' families be able to hold Boeing accountable? Uh, Senator, I'm not in a position to comment on that. Uh, but I would certainly be willing to-to follow up with you - on-on that, uh, question. - Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Did Boeing lie to the FAA? I can't say. I-I can't say. I mean, I-- definitely there was incomplete, uh, information and fragmented information that was provided. - That's bullshit. - Did the FAA screw up in certifying the 737 MAX? I have concerns, I would say, that there were mistakes made, yes. Come on, Senator. In Washington, the passive voice is a great way of avoiding responsibility. Who made the mistakes and why? The-the, uh, the manufacturer made mistakes, and the FAA made mistakes in its, in its oversight of the manufacturer. And what were the mistakes and why were they made? The full implications of the, uh, flight control system were not understood, uh, -as design changes were made. -Come on. Has anyone at FAA been fired? Uh, no one has been fired over this particular matter, um, up to this point, but... Has anyone been disciplined over this matter? No, not specifically. So, unknown somebodies made unspecified mistakes for which there have been no repercussions? -Zero accountability. -You understand, sir, you do not work for Boeing, you work for the American people. With that, this hearing is now adjourned. Who got fired? Nobody. Who got demoted? Nobody. This is our government, our government. This is our government in action. Just ridiculous. Come on, Jordan.

I think he sort of owns it and feels very, very guilty, maybe responsible a little bit for the deaths of these people, and it's very difficult to watch him, 'cause he's not. I thought he was doing a time line mostly of just the things that he had done. But this is everything. I am beyond pissed. It should not be that hard to get the FAA to do their damn job. But you still have the Department of Justice investigation going on, so it's not over yet. ♪ ♪ As part of the Department of Justice investigation, Boeing was forced to release some documents. Instant messages and emails between a couple of pilots at Boeing that's completely off script, and they're saying things Boeing would never have wanted to see the light of day. And we're reading them, and you're realizing as a journalist, "Oh, my God, readers are gonna be outraged." Boeing's chief technical pilot, Mark Forkner, saw it as his job to dissuade airlines and regulators all over the world from wanting extra training for the pilots. This guy Forkner, he is doing it because, higher up at the company, they decided that a major program goal was not to require pilot training. This was a business competitive advantage and was very important to Boeing. Boeing had promised pilots who flew the old model 737 could transition to this MAX model with minimal training-- two hours on an iPad. Seriously, an iPad. Boeing had written into the contract with Southwest a guarantee: "You will not have to train your pilots on the simulator, "and if you do, we'll pay you a million dollars per airplane. That's how seriously we're taking this." And there was a-a chilling moment when I got in the middle of the document and I saw this exchange and I realized that Forkner was telling his deputy, Patrick Gustavsson, that he had, that day, managed to dissuade Lion Air... ...not to have simulator training for its pilots. Lion Air did actually ask for more training, and Boeing went out of its way to stop them from getting it. Mark Forkner tells his deputy, "I just Jedi mind tricked these fools." What we also learned was that MCAS was changed in a way that was gonna be a real problem, and if the FAA knew about it, they were gonna change the training requirements. So these two guys at that moment, under pressure from senior managers, caved and-and decided not to tell the FAA. "The airplane," meaning the MAX, "The airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys." This is bad engineering. It's bad safety. It's devastating consequences. And after the MAX wrapped, these guys were given an award by Boeing because they delivered exactly what their bosses had wanted. What's Boeing going to do to answer this mess? We don't know, but I would expect criminal charges. The U.S. now has its first confirmed case of the deadly new coronavirus. The Dow dropping more than 2,300 points. Airports and airlines devastated. This airport is empty. The parking lot is empty. ...at all times until they are checked. Because of the COVID-19 crisis, what we have is a company that's in terrible shape business-wise. Boeing, the number one component in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, in a freefall at this moment. So they really depend on the 737 MAX getting back to get cash flow coming again. We have to help Boeing. We have to help the airline industry. It wasn't their fault. This wasn't their fault. It has to work or Boeing can't keep going. ♪ ♪ Yeah. Um, what about the... Are you sure? ♪ ♪ Today, we're gonna watch the FAA administrator fly the MAX on a test flight. This is one of the last steps apparently before the plane gets recertified.

Steve, uh, I'd like to ask you a question that actually comes from one of the families of the victims in an email this morning, and it's something that the-the families have been repeating. They say today's flight is a public relations stunt, a gift to Boeing. This is not a publicity stunt. This is simply, uh, the fulfillment of a commitment, a promise that I made, uh, within my first few weeks at the FAA. The 737 aircraft-- and statistically it may be the safest airplane that's ever been built. You know, as I've said many times, safety's a journey, and it is something that we need to continue... The FAA is supposed to be our watchdog, our guardian and our protector. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. Doesn't make sense to me. At all. ♪ ♪ This is a settlement as a result of the DOJ's grand jury investigation. Boeing avoided criminal prosecution for criminal misconduct today for giving the FAA false information about the 737 MAX. As part of this agreement, which is, by the way, what many people on Wall Street expected, Boeing has agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion. That fine's only a slap on the wrist when you consider the severity of the charges. Boeing had a problem. They dealt with the problem working with the government. They together crafted this announcement that basically said, "Look, we're responsible... "...but only because we had some bad apples, "and the bad apples didn't have senior management. It was these guys." These two guys were guilty, pilots from the internal Boeing emails, Mark Forkner and his deputy Patrick Gustavsson. They've been thrown to the wolves here. Forkner does what he's told, and now he's basically being left as a scapegoat for what Boeing did. And the DOJ actually went out of their way-- and this is not normal-- they explicitly say that senior management didn't do anything. All of the senior management at Boeing are off scot-free, and not only scot-free but, you know, with their huge million-dollar salaries all intact and no threat to them at all. Hey. I'm on a call. Can I call you back? Yeah. Just come by when you're done. All right. It's really annoying that Boeing is able to pay money to avoid criminal responsibility, but honestly it's great for the case 'cause we make the same allegations that the government now has settled with Boeing, and that is essentially Boeing defrauded the FAA. These guys, um, Forkner and Gustavsson, are the two technical pilots. They do what they're doing because they're under orders from above, but the guys above, the executives who gave the order, they got away with it. And that frankly goes back to this whistleblower that we've been talking about, Ed Pierson. After the first crash, I wrote to the CEO. "You need to know we got to stop and do the job properly." Right after that, I wrote to the board of directors. And it was a certified letter 'cause I wanted to make sure that it was documented. I was pleading with them to act. And then, a couple weeks later, the Ethiopian Airline crashes. Pierson comes along and he says, "That's not just those two guys. "I went to Muilenburg and said there are real problems on the assembly line, manufacturing process." So you begin to develop a larger picture of a corporate attitude to put money and, uh, profit above safety. Everybody in the Boeing organization says, "Safety first, safety first, safety first." Is that true? Is that true or is that a canard? Is that baloney? Right now, I like the idea of, uh, getting Pierson, uh, on paper. Yeah.

I've talked to high-level people inside Boeing who feel a sense of guilt but they don't believe they did anything deliberately wrong. The sin wasn't anything deliberate. It was going along with the system that was there and not questioning it enough. This is a very American story because it's the American corporate culture at the root of what's gone wrong. What happened within the FAA in withdrawing further and further from its direct oversight role, that was just a political move. Boeing lobbied and paid politicians and convinced them that they needed to get out of the way of industry. Boeing said, "We want regulation out of the way. We'll control it 'cause we're efficient and we can do it ourselves." Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff. DeFAZIO: Predatory capitalism will kill itself. And it'll kill people.
