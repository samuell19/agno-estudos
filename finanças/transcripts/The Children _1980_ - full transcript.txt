Go ahead. - When are you going to ask me out? I'm dying for a ride in that fabulous machine of yours. Anytime, ma'am. - Listen, why don't you call me Sal or Sally or divorced with two kids, but Christ, drop this ma'am stuff. Yes, ma'am, ah, Sal. - So when do I get my ride? - When do- - I'm off tonight at 10. I'll see ya at 10. Um, time I paid up, huh? Oh, no, that's okay. Just don't be late tonight. - So, did you make any big sales today? - No, but it's still pretty early. - Well not many cars have come by here since the interstate opened. No, but it's still pretty early. We get a lotta cars. They always- - God, the sheriff. I'll be home tonight for suppa. Well, is anybody at home? No. We're all alone then? Yeah. Dr. Gould. Sorry to bother you. Be quiet, Queen. Quiet! Is Miss Button at home? Why? I'd like to speak to her. She's not feeling very well. - Ah, has Tommy come home from school yet? No, why do you ask? - Strange. I just ran up on the school bus about a 100 or so yards before the entrance to your place, and... Queen! -Ah, Fred's not on it, and none of the kids, so - Joyce? - I thought maybe they'd come down here. Joyce? Who's there? Just the sheriff. It's alright. I'll be with you in a minute. Headache? Who's at the door? Oh, it's just the sheriff. He needs my help for few minutes. Don't worry. I want you to take a couple of codeine. And rest. Is Tommy home? Soon. Okay, let's go, c'mon. - I really don't think it's anything to be alarmed about. - Yeah, I'd rather just take a look for myself, though. Sure. It's strange. They couldn't have just disappeared. Sheriff? Sheriff? These are Tommy's things. - This everything he had with him today? I guess so. Harry? Harry, Sheriff Hart here. Come in, Harry. Dammit Harry, answer me. Yeah, Billy. - Are you still out at the MacKenzie place? Yes, sir. But I was just about to come into the office. How long you been there? How long have I been here? Billy, I just been talkin' for a few minutes. - Dammit, Harry, just give me some straight answers. I don't wanna dock your pay. Did you see the school bus pass there? No, sir. - Did anything pass you on the way out to the interstate? What, you mean cars? I mean anything, Harry. A car, a station wagon, truck, maybe? No, nothin' gone by us here. What's up, Billy? I just found a school bus about a hundred yards from the Gould place. Motor's still running but no Fred and no kids. - Is your brother home from school yet? Paul? No, he isn't home yet. - Well, now Sheriff, now how could the bus have gotten all the way down to where you are without us seein' it? Harry? - Sheriff. - Get out to the interstate, set up a road block. I don't want anything goin' out of here unless you check it, you understand? Yes, sir. - And nobody comes in unless they live here. I'll, I'll send a couple of boys out to you as soon as I can. - Alright, Billy, I'm on my way. Bye. Tommy? Okay, at least the bus is out of the middle of the road. - I don't know where the hell they could be. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, you know? I know. Why don't I take you home? No, that's alright, I'll Walk. They'll turn up. Try to be patient. Easier said than done. I just don't know how Leslie's gonna take it when she finds out Tommy's missing. Don't tell her. That's one way to deal with it. I'll be in touch. Yeah, thanks. Joyce? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? Joyce. Tommy. Hank, those are skinny birds. - Come on, Molly, it's a beautiful bird. Skinny little birds. - Molly, if you want 'em any bigger, you're gonna have to wait a couple of months. This is as big as they are right now. - Oh, I don't want... - They're pretty near full size. - Yeah, I suppose so. Well, what are you gonna do? Alright. - Howdy, Hank. Frank. Sheriff. Sheriff. - Boys, I need a couple of deputies for a roadblock out by the interstate. Ya interested? Maybe. Maybe. $20.00 a day. County'll pick up the tab. - Oh, that sounds fine with us, Sheriff. That's okay with us, Sheriff. Mm, must be somethin' big if the county's payin' them kind of wages, uh? - Molly, you heard anything from Fred this afternoon? No, why? - I ran across the school bus about a mile outside of town across from the cemetery. Yeah? - I can't find Fred or any of the kids. Ah, hell, Fred's not much more than a kid himself, Sheriff. Well, there ain't nothin' to worry about. I'll bet he took 'em to the stone quarry. Boys, better be on your way. Harry Timmons is already out there. - We'll get on out to the roadblock, Sheriff. Billy, how serious is this business? Molly, I just don't know. Hmm? - Found the bus parked across the road. Motor still runnin'. - Yeah? Nobody on it. - Well, damn, that's not like Fred. He wouldn't leave that motor runnin'. Yeah, I know. My God. I wonder why? - Hey, John. Sergeant Preston. Hey, John. Molly, I need a can of ether. Another can of ether, John? Why don't you get a real mechanic to tune up that car of yours? I just got it out. How come you're not hidin' by the side of the road? Not the day for it. Kids go to school today? - Here, John - Boy, things must really be slow around here, huh, Molly? No, really. Well, Johnny did. Clarkie? - Well, Clarkie's home with a cold. Why? What's up? Fred? Ah, that ole fart. - Listen, if you've got a couple of minutes, why don't you come out with me, we'll take a look around. - Well, I gotta go out to Cathy, let her know about it. See, I don't want her to worry about it. - Okay, I'll stop by the Miss Shore's place and then go over to the Chandler's. I'll pick you up at your place in what, 10 minutes? - Yeah, about 10 minutes should be alright. Okay, he)', tell Cathy not to worry, huh? Yeah, Cathy'll be alright. Piece of shit haul. Fred, do you hear me? Fred? Answer me this second. Miss Shore? Anybody home? Miss Shore? Miss Shore? - Sheriff Hart, how nice. Is Janet at home? - Isn't she a little young for you, Sheriff? She's only nine. Miss Shore, please. - I really haven't the faintest idea. Jack, darling, have you seen Janet lurking around the house? No, sweet. - She's always lurking around the house. - I don't wanna alarm you about your daughter, Miss Shore. I discovered the school bus out by the cemetery. None of the children were on it. Neither was Fred Mansfield, the driver. - Mansfield's a bit senile, if you ask me. He probably took them on an impromptu picnic or something. - Did Janet say anything about a picnic this mornin'? - I really haven't the faintest idea. I never rise before 10. Not now, love. Exactly what are you trying to tell us, Sheriff? That Janet is missing. Along with all the other children of Ravensback. - You don't think they've been kidnapped, do you? I don't know what to think. Ah, a kidnapping in Ravensback. Oh, Jack, how exciting. - This is a, this is a lovely piece, Miss Shore. - Why Sheriff, I didn't know you were into art. Jack and I brought that back from Rome last year, didn't we, darling? Call me if Janet shows up. Goddamn. Oh, yeah. - What's the trouble? - What's the trouble? It's the damn carb again. Oh. Here, let me have a try. Oh, sure. Try it. I gotta get home. - Hell, why don't I give you a lift? I just have to stop by the Chandler's. Oh, shit. - Talkin' about? It won't take but a minute. Oh, yeah. Here, I'll push ya off. Oh, oh. Mommy. Ellen. Daddy. Harry? I can't. - You mean I rode all the way down here to see you and you won't even kiss me? I can't. - Think he won't kiss her? - Yeah, I'll kiss her. Come on, Harry, kiss me. - Do you wanna kiss her first? - Your boy is gonna Not now. - kiss her. - Whole lotta nerve as far as I'm concerned. Later. Well, then I'm going home. - Look at that hair. - You look at the hair. - I'm lookin' at the hair. - Yeah, I'm not lookin' it. She got pretty hair. - Ooh. Goodbye, Harry. I can't now, I'm working. Goodbye, Harry. Kiss me, Harry. I'm goin' home, Harry. Bye, Harry. - Harry, you get into that sweet little thing yet? Hey, come on. Tell the truth, Harry. Will you guys give me a break? - I'll bet he'd settle for a hand job, right Harry? - Go on, Hank. Tell us, Harry. Yeah, tell us, Harry. - Tell us, Harry. - Tell us, Harry. I don't do things like that. Well, we'll do it for ya. Right Hank? - Right, we'll do it for ya, Harry. - I bet you would. - You're damn right we would. Now, what the hell? Howdy. What's the problem? - I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't let anybody in. - Perhaps you could tell me what the problem is? No, sir. - I take it you don't know who I am? No, sir. And nobody who doesn't live in Ravensback is allowed in. Orders. - Apparently you're new here in Ravensbank. I'm Sanford Butler-Jones. You do know who Dee Dee Shore is? Yes, sir. - Why don't you just ring Dee Dee up, and I'm sure everything will be cool. Well, I don't know her number. Who is this guy? - I don't know, some, looks like a pimp. Hello, Dee Dee? Hi, darling. Listen, I'm sorry we're late, but we've been detained by a little misunderstanding here in town. An encounter with a policeman. Would you, darling? Well, thanks a lot. We'll be right along. Miss Shore. Yes, ma'am. God, I'd like to hump that bitch. - Yes, ma'am. Well, you'd have to be on - Yes, your own. - Ma'am, but the sheriff I'd take her on my own. Yes, ma'am. Well, if you say so, ma'am. Goodbye. I guess you can go through. She acts like she wants to die. Get around her, now. Mrs. Peterson? Mrs. Peterson, I've got your apples. Oh. Mrs. Peterson?

Oh, darn. I tried calling you. That damn wagon broke down again, and Billy had to give me a lift. It's okay. Is Jennifer with you? No. - She was supposed to come directly home after school. I was gonna work on her portrait this afternoon. - Honey, we don't know where any of the Ravensback kids are. What are you talking about? I passed the bus on my way home from the doctors. Were the kids on it? Of course they were on it. It's just that Billy found the bus near the old cemetery. Empty- Empty? John? Hi, Cathy. - John just told me you found an empty school bus. Sorry. - Well, we're gonna find them safe and sound. Huh, Billy? - Whoopee! Hey, hi. Hi, Sheriff. - Clarkie, Clarkie, it's your bedtime. No. - Now he can stay up for awhile, huh?
