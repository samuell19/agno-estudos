Oh, shut up, June, you stupid whining, bitch! [ dog whimpering ] Enid Pearly, I really do not know where you learned such language. Shame on you. You know the Lord doesn't like it when little girls talk like that. Come to Momma. Shh. And I'm sure that Harry's mother would not allow it. Now would she, Harry? No, ma'am, she wouldn't. She wouldn't. Damn right. [ muttering ] [ mocking ]No, ma'am, she wouldn't. Move it. [ doorbell ringing ] Oh, Lord, there is no rest for the weary. Shit. Harry, that will be your mother. Enid, be a dear and watch your sister for a sec. [ doorbell ringing ] Oh, my God. There, there, June baby. What's the matter? Are you cold? Is that it? Is my little sister Junie-wunie cold? Enid, what are you doing? None of your business, butt face. You're gonna get it, Enid. You really are. Uh-oh. Hurry up, Harry. Come on back to the kitchen, Mrs. Hopper. [ Enid whistling ] Say hello to Mrs. Hopper, Enid. Hi, Mrs. Hopper. Hi, Mom. Hello, Harry. Enid, where's June? - Oh, June. - Oh, Harry.

You asshole. Tell me something, June. have you been able to get anything out of Mr. Peewee over here? Enid. Ahh! Now I want you to fess up and tell me right now how long this has being going on. Quick! Now just cool it, okay? We just have to-- we're all adults, right? Well, we just have to... be adult. God, are you just completely brain dead? Adult? You want me to be an adult? I think you're right. I think I should be an adult, I do. At your funeral. Oh, God. [ gunshot ] - Give me the gun. - Dick head. JUNE: Wait. Get up. You dickless wonder! I killed her. Don't be stupid. She's not dead. - My own sister. - She's just unconscious. - My own flesh and blood. - Enid? Dead. Enid. Enid. She's dead. Are you sure? I'm sure. Oh, my God. [ doorbell ringing ] [ doorbell continues ringing ] Don't you think you better go get the door, Harry? [ ringing continues ] Oh, shit. This is a .357 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You make one move, asshole, you're history. Floyd, so help me, one of these days. Where did you get that thing? I just got it in the mail. She's a beauty, isn't she? Um, did I hear a gunshot just now? - Gunshot? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, me and Enid, we're having a little fight. And you shot her? - Good thinking. - Don't be ridiculous. No. My gun fell off the table, and there is one in the chamber, you know. Um, we got to go now? Yeah, well, I gotta stop and get some ammo for this monster. HARRY: Look, I'll get Enid to drive me. I'll see you later, Floyd. Are you okay? Yeah, sure, I'm fine. - I'll see you in a while. - Are you sure? I'm okay, really. I'll see you later. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Come on, Harry, you're a cop. You're supposed to know about these things. Oh, God. Oh, mother of Jesus. Oh, God. I'm going down for this. I know it. I can feel it in my bones. - What? - Nothing. Come on, Harry, this is serious. I can feel it in my bones. - I said this is serious. - I'm going down. No shit. No shit. It's all your fault. My fault? My fault? You are the one that cracked her over the head. Why did you have to hit her so hard, June? God! You're the one that came on to me in the first place. What? You came on to me over that Christmas party down at Ronnie's Pizza. It was 2 years ago. Yeah, well, if you hadn't started hitting on me, we wouldn't be in this mess, now, would we? Am I really hearing this? Well, you did come on to me first, didn't you? Admit it. Okay, I admit it. It's my fault, all right? So what? Does that change anything? You feel better now? I'm sorry, honey. Really. I'm sorry, okay? I gave her that clown for her birthday last year. She hated it. What do you mean? She said she loved it. She lied. Really? Yeah. It's been hell, June, I swear. Your sister was driving me to an early grave. Oh, please stop bawling, honey. I can't help it. I mean, I just killed my sister. I got a right, don't I? I mean, even if she was a bitch, I got a right, don't I? Yes, you do, sweetheart. You have every right. What are we gonna do? Well, you know... I mean... We could own up, take the rap, plead self-defense. The problem there is, folks ain't gonna take to a woman killing her own sister 'cause she found out she's screwing her husband. I guess I'd be an accomplice 'cause I was the one doing the screwing. Life in prison, is that what you're trying to say? Like life. Well, no, just hang on. We could get off for good behavior after... I don't know, 20 years? Great. Or-- I know this is gonna sound illegal. Maybe we could make it look sorta like an accident. I can't believe she hated this clown. A car accident. Cost me a fortune. If we could just get her out to the car with no one seeing. I was gonna buy it for myself. What do you think? About what? Making it look like an accident, June. A car accident. Look, if we play our cards right, we got to be real careful, baby, I think we can pull it off. Wait a few months, stay away from each other till things calm down. We could be together. Just like we always talked about. Huh? Not now, Harry. Well, June, what do you think about what I just said, about disposing of the body? No, no, Harry. It sounds so terrible. I mean, I never thought of Enid as a body before. Honey, she's never been dead before. Yeah, not like that. Seems like we don't have much of a choice, sweetheart. Why did you have to be such a bitch, Enid, always giving me a hard time, giving everybody a hard time? We don't really have a choice, do we? Well, this is a dumb idea, Harry. I feel so stupid. No, no, it's good. You and Enid sort of look the same. Oh, thanks. From a distance, honey, I meant from a distance. Anybody sees us, they'll just think you're Enid. Head up 301 to the mountains. There's a road that goes to El Rado. - Do you know it? - Yeah. Go about 200 yards past that road, there's a real sharp curve, you pull over, you put Enid into the driver's seat. Are you listening to me? - Yes. - Pour some whisky on her, you know, make her look like she was drunk. And then, well, just let her go. She's got a bump on her head, right? No one will ever know. It's gonna work, honey. It's gonna work perfect. Do you really like this lipstick color? I don't. Listen, honey, as soon as you dump the car, mess yourself up a little, you know, roll around in the dirt. Why the hell would I want to do that? Well, get the dust out of the attic, honey. You're gonna have to say you jumped out of the car just before it went over. Watch out! - Jesus. - No need to yell at me. I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous, all right? Never had a murder on my hands-- God, don't say murder, Harry. It sounds so... Well, Harry. Yeah. If I push the car over the cliff, how am I supposed to get back home? You're gonna have to hitchhike. Hitchhike? Pull over there. Oh, shit, there's Floyd. Okay, you understand? You got everything clear? - Oh, Enid. - Bye. [ tires screeching ] [ cars honking ] Oh, God. Oh, she's in a hurry. What's up? Oh, she's going to Santa Fe to see her parents, Floyd. She's real late. She looks different. She's taking better care of herself, right? You got that right. I finally put my foot down. Oh, God, I know that I sinned. I know that you're punishing me for what me and Harry done. Shit, God, give me a break. Please, please, just give me a break. How the hell's Jasper? Yeah. Just told me he had to have his leg cut off, amputated. Honey, you just listen to Mavis now. I'd put him out of his misery. I really would. They get real nasty when they get a handicap like that. I'd just put him right out of his misery. [ laughing ] You're such a card. Oh. MAVIS: Police station. Hi, Mavis. This is, uh... Doreen Waverly. Is Harry there? Harry? Hey, go tell Sherlock his Aunt Doreen's on the phone. He's in the can. - We playing bingo Friday? - Well, I don't know, but I will certainly let you know, okay? Charlene's gonna be there. No one's seen her new thighs yet. It's your Aunt Doreen. He's coming. Hold on. Doreen, how are you? Harry, she's stuck in the door. Uh, w-w-what's that you say, Doreen? Enid is stuck in the goddamn door, so you're gonna have to come back over here and help me get her into the goddamn car. How in the hell, June... Well, you don't say. Uh, well, I don't know if I can do that, Doreen. You see, me and Floyd here, he's right here, see, and we have to go out on a call. Harry Lee Hopper, if you do not get your ass back here right now, so help me, I'll shove your plan where the sun don't shine. You hear me? Sure do, Auntie, I sure do. I'll see what I can... ...can do, Doreen. I'll see you soon. Problem, Harry? No, no, no problem. Just got to swing by the house and pick something up. My Aunt Doreen. I'll be right back. Oh, my God, look at this. Come on, I only got a couple of minutes. Floyd's waiting in the car. Why can't you come by and pick me up? What? Well, I'm gonna be standing out there in the middle of nowhere with my thumb stuck out, covered in dirt. What if I know the person who picks me up? I just don't see why I have to do all the disposing. Honey, if I don't get back to that car in 2 minutes, you are not gonna have to worry about the way you look for the next 20 years. You'll pick me up then? Yes. Yes, yes, come on. - Harry. - What? Do you love me? Yes. Yes, June, I do. Then say it. Say that you love me. I love you, June. I do. I love you with all my heart. Goddamn, I love you. Now come on, honey, for Christ sakes. Oh, God. God. All right, get her strapped in. Make sure she's sitting upright. I gotta go. But, Harry... Ah! - Floyd. - Harry. Come on, let's go. Uh, you're dripping with sweat, Harry. I'll be damned. I must be coming down with a cold or something. Let's stop by the store and get some aspirin. Come on, let's go. Is there anything you want to tell me? No, everything is fine, partner. Come on, let's get out of here. You sure? Okay, Floyd, there is something. I'll tell you in the car. Babs called. Charlene wants you to come in early on Monday because Mrs. Chambers needs a perm for the wedding. Okay? You know, maybe I wouldn't get 20 years. I mean, maybe the judge would have pity on me. Wait a minute. I could plead insanity. No, they'll not believe me. Oh. You were even ugly as a child. You know, you always laughed when you hurt me. You hurt me all the time, all the time. You hated me from the moment I was born. All right, why don't you tell your Uncle Floydie here what's going on. Well, it's like this, see... Me and Enid-- Well, me and Enid haven't been getting on too well lately, Floyd. You know, Floyd, she may be having an affair. - What? - Yeah. She says she's going up to Santa Fe to see her folks, and I don't know. I think she's going up to see her lover. Enid has a lover? Oh, Harry, you got to be kidding. I mean, who in their right mind would ever-- You're all tied in now. There you go. [ engine revving ] You know, I cannot remember the last time we went for a little drive together. Can you? Here we go. Oh, geez. Oh. Get off of me. God, the Lopez' trailer. A big-city cop would probably shoot himself if he had to wash his own patrol car. I can't help it, Harry. - I just envy those guys. - I know you do, buddy. They haven't got time for this in New York or Chicago. They're too busy fighting crime, real crime. Armed robbery, murder, gang warfare, your dope-crazed terrorists, they got it all. I don't know, Floyd, you could say hello to a bullet any day of the week. God, you really like scarin' me, don't you? You remember that Halloween when you put that pig's head in my lap? Blood everywhere all over my pretty white costume, and you couldn't stop laughing. Oh, now we're out of gas. I suppose you think that's funny, too, huh? What have we got? We got Sam pluggin' rabbits in the middle of Main Street during the lunch rush. It's not enough to keep us sharp. I need crime, Harry, real soon. You know what I mean? Floyd, I know what you mean. Shit. Oh, my God. Ah! Is this what you're looking for? Wasn't locked. So the guy just stands there with a daiquiri in one hand, and a gun like a cannon with eight barrels in the other. He puts the daiquiri down on the tray. He smiles, and then, boom, boom, boom, boom, he mows them down, 40 people chopped in half... You filled it with unleaded gas. This car takes leaded. It will ruin the engine. That will be 20 bucks. Why didn't you tell me that before? You didn't ask. Oh, that's great. Thanks a lot. Hey, 20 bucks. My money is in my purse. Glad to hear it. Yeah, well, I've locked the keys in the car. What about your friend here? Why don't you just ask her to open the door? She's sleeping. He's only got one bullet left in his .45, right smack in the forehead. Boom! Right between the eyes, one shot, real clean. - That was it. - Floyd. Yeah. I'll be right back. I got to make a phone call. - [ knocking on window ] - JUNE: Enid. FLOYD: Hey, come on, hurry up. JUNE: She's been drinking. I think she just passed out. ATTENDANT: Lady, I don't care. Ah! What's going on, June? Harry, I've locked the keys in the car. Enid is... well, you know. No, I don't know. Well, she's sleeping. I mean, you know, she's been drinking a lot, and you know how she is when she drinks. You know this lady, Harry? [ car horn honking ] Yeah, sort of. She owes me 20 bucks. Hey, it looks like we're just gonna have to wake her up. [ June grunting ] Oh, thank God. MAN: Hey, what's the hold up? [ car honking ] - Oh! - Shit. Haven't been getting on too well lately. It's a family thing, you know. [ horn honking ] You okay, honey? MAN: Come on, let's go. [ horn honking ] Geez, she's shit faced. You got that right. You know, I do not know why I got involved with him in the first place. Must've been crazy. You know, those cops just love telling people what to do. June, do this. June, do that. I don't know, Enid, really don't. I mean, my life has been a tragedy, Enid. A tragedy. What did I do to deserve a sister like you? From day one, nothing but hell on earth. A tragedy. Dangerous curve. Well, here we are. It'll will be over soon, Enid. Oh, my God. [ gasps ] Shit. Shit! Shit. Shit. Great idea, Harry, real great. Just drive her over the edge. Now what? Do you have any other bright ideas? Damn it. That's it. Thank you. Now what am I gonna do with you? What are we gonna do? I'll be right back. [ indistinct talk on radio ] Bottle of Jack Daniel's. That will be $6.49. Hey, how you doing? You want to party there, little lady? You from around here? Not very friendly, huh? You got a pay phone? Hey, put out the flags. She talked. There's a pay phone outside by the cage. Hey there, sweet cakes, you want to party? I got some beers, you got some JD. What do you say? Mavis, hi, this is Lucy Stark, cousin. Lucy, is Harry there? Well, could you-- could you radio him, and get him to call me at 555-2219? Yeah, no, it's a pay phone. I'm gonna be waitin' here, okay? Uh-huh. Yes, yes, thank you. [ burping ] How about it, Cousin Lucy? You and me get down and party? Name's George, friends call me Jim. Listen, George, I am not in the mood. All right? So why don't you just get in your truck and truck off? You got an attitude problem there, lesbo. Maybe your friend there wants some. I doubt it. Shit, you never know till you ask, right? No, believe me, she is not in the mood. - She is sleeping, okay? - Hey, I got a mood right here. [ phone ringing ] - Hey, baby. - Harry? Oh, God, Harry, it's me. There was an accident at that place. What are you talking about, honey? There was an accident there already. I mean, there's cops, there's a road block. Now what am I gonna do? Oh, Jesus. Uh, where are you now? I'm at Jake's liquor store on the El Vayo Road. Okay, listen. There's another place further up the mountains, up at the lookout. You can do it there. Harry, I don't know. I mean, this whole thing it's getting really weird, all right? I mean, I am freaking out here, and there is this guy hitting on me, and right now, he is over with Enid. Hey, I like your outfit, swear to God, no kidding. Hey! I said that she was not interested, so just leave her alone. [ laughing ] Come on, sweetheart, let's play "strike the monkey." June. God. What do you mean he's over there with Enid? Who is over there with Enid? George. He's drunk. Hey! Whoo! Come on, baby. How would you like to sit on my big eight and twirl, huh? Listen, I've got to go. I will call you later, all right? June. - Hey! - Wake up in there. Hey, what's the matter? You look sick. Get off of the car. Don't get off the car, I don't care. What is the matter with you? Whoa! Please help me. Get off my car, you son of a bitch. Whoo! Whoo! My rodeo. My car! What did I ever do to you, I don't even know you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Sit up, Enid, please. I mean, we are in some really deep shit now, Enid, you know that? Oh, God. Great ride. Look, Harry, there's something I got to get off my chest. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Now don't get this wrong. I mean, just don't take it the wrong way or anything, all right? You've been acting pretty strange lately, and I was wondering... Are you on the take? On the take? Floyd, we're in Las Moscas, New Mexico, not the fucking Bronx! - Jesus, Floyd, sometimes. - All right. All right. So I'm off base there. I'm sorry, okay? You have been acting pretty weird. I told you, Floyd, it's Enid. She's two-timing me. I find that really hard to believe, I got to be honest. MAVIS: [ on radio ] Number 2, number 2, we got a disturbance at Jake's liquor store on the El Vayo road. Some woman's gone crazy with the car. Require assistance. Over. Oh, I'm glad you're not on the take. Okay, now, let's get out there, right. We're on our way, Mave. JUNE: Momma used to bring you, me and Harry up to this lookout when we were kids. You'd creep up behind me, and pretend to push me over the edge. Been scared of heights ever since. I think it's kind of fitting that this is gonna be your final resting place, don't you? So beautiful. Isn't that romantic, Enid? You remember those days? Seems like 100 years. You remember Bobby Ellis? God, what a hunk he was. Football team, senior prom. He asked me to marry him, you know? Yeah, he did, night of the prom. I thought he asked me 'cause he just wanted to get laid. The thing was, that's all I wanted to do. So we did it. Boys' locker room, behind the gym. It was wonderful. Then Mr. Higgins, the math teacher, walked in just as he was havin' his orgasm. Bobby fell off the table and broke his elbow. He said that ruined his pro-ball career. Now he's selling insurance over in Albuquerque. Magic goes, don't it? The sparkle. I mean, everything just gets so complicated, difficult. Rotten. Life just whizzes by. Before you know it, you're old. Fed up, ready to meet your Maker. You know, I bet if Bobby had not fallen off that table... that he would have become a pro and married me. But God said let's see what would happen if Mr. Higgins walked in. How are they gonna deal with that? You know, she would never have said it to my face, but I knew that Mom could not stand the way that you were always going on about Harry not making enough money. You made him feel worthless sometimes, you know that? He told me. He said, "Enid makes me feel worthless sometimes." He did, he said that. You know, Susie over at the salon says that you are having an affair with Mr. Suarez. God, I just cannot imagine you with Mr. Suarez. Of course, I can't imagine you with anybody. I mean, why would any man ever want to have any-- [ engine starting ] Well, see, Officer, me and Enid pulled over for a little drink to watch the sun go down. Now I-- I got out, and I went for a stroll, you know, to get some fresh air as the sun was going down. Now Enid must have been trying to pull the car around or something. Because, before I knew it, the car was rolling down into the barrel pit. I mean, there was nothing that I could do, just nothing. [ screaming ] We better go find this little lady. - She sounds like a maniac. - God, the guy was drunk. - Look at him. - Guys, I only want the beer. She was probably just protecting herself. Come on, Harry, let's check it out. She's dangerous. She could kill somebody. Floyd, whoever she was, she's just pissed off at the guy. [ engine turning over ] Why did you do this to me? Do you know that 75% of all Mafia hit men are women? - What? - No shit, it's a fact. - So? - So you never know. Let's go. Floyd. Floyd. Come on, let's go. She's gone. You look like shit, Enid. I can't take you into town looking like that. I'm really sorry about this, honey, but I think that you're just gonna have to rot in the trunk. Sorry, Lord, I really am. I swear I didn't mean to hit her so hard. I mean, she was gonna shoot Harry. If she did, there'd be nobody around to take care of me. We were going to tell you just as soon as you got back from Santa Fe. I swear to God, we were. We were gonna get married right after the divorce. I know that it was wrong for me and Harry to be doing what we did, but these things happen, don't they? God. I mean, you read about it all the time, don't you? I do, all the time. Well, you see, Officer, me and Enid, we were staying here at this motel, and, I mean, I was sleeping. And when I woke up, she was gone. I mean, she must have just wandered out into the desert or something for sort of, I don't know, what, a stroll? And I don't know. Why? What do you mean, she's dead? That's impossible. Oh, my God, how did it happen? Shit. [ coyote howling ] Look, I know-- I know it's gonna be lonely out here and everything, and I'm sorry. I really am, I swear. Just think that this is-- this is for the best, okay? Bye, Enid. Shit. Oh, please. Come on, you son of a bitch. Oh, God. What the hell do you think you are doing? Well, I-- I came off the road to relieve myself, if you must know. All right. This is an old Indian burial ground, you know. - It's sacred. - Really? I'm sorry, I didn't know. Yeah, well, Indians don't appreciate people who defecate on their burial grounds. What do you think this is, a public john? Look, I said I was sorry, didn't I? Ugh. Excuse me. I seem to be stuck in the sand here. Do you think that you could give me a tow back to the road? Please. There was a storm, and I slipped in the mud. All right, come on. Boom! Head explodes like a cantaloupe. Then the wife walks in. The guy turns around and opens up on her. Psshh. Covers her from head to toe. She flies out the window, lands on a passing car, goes right through the windshield, the car hits a fire hydrant, and then right into the clothing store window. Dummies flying everywhere. Man, it was just crazy. MAVIS: [ on radio ] Number 2? Number 2? Hello, are you there? Yeah, Mave, it's Floyd. What's up? It's Enid for Harry. Wants him to call her back at 555-8870. It's a pay phone. Enid? Hi there. Hello? Excuse me? Yes, ma'am. It's my car. Fill 'er up. No, I think that it's-- it's-- the radiator, it's overheating. I don't know, it could be a, what, hose? Leaded or unleaded. No, no. It's the radiator. We don't have unleaded. No, it's the radiator. The radiator. Could be the radiator. God. [ phone ringing ] Hello. Enid. Harry. June. Harry, thank God. Listen, we got to get Enid. June, do you realize you almost gave me a fucking heart attack? Give me a break here. What exactly do you mean, "We got to go get Enid"? Well, she's buried. I mean, she's not really buried. She's sort of half buried somewhere in the desert in this Indian burial ground or something. June, I'm supposed to be on duty here. I can't just drive over there with Floyd. What am I gonna tell him? Enid is buried? Half buried in the desert somewhere, and I got to go look for her? God! This guy saw me out there already, Harry, okay. The shit is about to hit the fan. Okay, where are you? I'm at this gas station on the 301. It's about 5 miles north of that El Vayo sign. Harry, please hurry up. He picks up this machine gun and throws it away right through the door. Ugh, blood everywhere-- - Floyd. - Yeah. Would you stop at the store? I want to pick up - some chocolates for Enid. - Yeah, yeah, sure. Anyway, so the guy is standing there at his dead brother's feet. His brother's blood all over him. He's holding this kitchen knife in his hand. Cars are funny things. I reckon they come off the assembly line looking pretty much alike, but I believe those cars come off the assembly line with a kind of soul. They come out of there with a destiny, same as you and me. Floyd, you mind going in and getting the chocolates for me? I owe some money from the last time, and, well, I'm a little short tonight. I don't know, Harry. You've been piss poor company tonight, you know? Hey, I'm sorry, man. Really. Something in a box with flowers on it. She likes flowers. Hi, Henry. Where's the chocolate? I got to get chocolate for him. Shit. My ass is grass, man. I don't go down for murder, I sure as hell am gonna lose this job. All right, open the cash box, nice and easy. Do as the man said, motherfucker, or I'll blow your fucking head off. I'm not playing with you, shit head. Five seconds, open up that cash box. Come on, come on. You want to be dead meat, motherfucker? - Come on. - Just a second. One, two, three. The dude's a fucking asshole. Come on, motherfucker. Do as the man says or I'll blow your fucking head off. Okay. One two, three, four, five. Here. Here. Here. [ indistinct shouting ] Freeze! Shit. Is everything okay? You all right? Yeah. Harry? Harry! Harry! MAVIS: [ on radio ] Number 2, number 2, Harry, you there? Over. Harry, there's been a hold up at the 7-Eleven over on Maple. One guy is dead. The other one got away. What? Are you in pursuit or what? We require assistance here. Over. Uh, yeah, Mave, this is Harry. I'm in pursuit. Is Floyd okay? Over. Yeah, Floyd's okay, but he is shittin' himself, Harry. He says that one guy saw the getaway car. It's a yellow or orange Oldsmobile. [ honking ] Is that the one, Harry? Over. It's difficult to say, Mave. It could be. Over and out. I believe those cars come off the assembly line with a kind of soul, soul of their own. They come out of there with a destiny, - same as you and me. - [ siren wailing ] Their lives are sort of predestined if you get my drift. - [ siren wailing ] - You know what? I think I'm just gonna fix this thing when I get home. No, you never know. You could be right. It could be-- she was just a little thirsty. You got to learn how to communicate with your car. Well, take your time, why don't you? I've been waiting here for hours. You won't believe what just happened. I left Floyd at the 7-Eleven. Oh, never mind. Come on, I'll follow you. He was the one who got me into this thing in the first place. If he didn't come on to me at that party, I would not be here right now, would I? What a damn fool I was. Her goddamn sister. The same goddamn family. I was lonely. I was getting back at Enid. That's it. I was getting back at Enid. Jesus H. Christ. How can anybody be so goddamn stupid? How could you bury someone accidentally? Mother of God. Sorry, I didn't know you were gonna stop. Jesus. She looks so weird. How did she get like this? Listen, Harry, I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm fed up, I'm sacred shitless, and I think I'm going crazy, so don't you ask me any more stupid questions. Okay? I've had enough. Well, that's a pretty obvious question, June. I think I've got every right to ask you. I can't take it anymore, Harry, I can't. I can't take it anymore. MAVIS: [ on radio] Number 2, number 2, Harry, you there? Over. Okay. Okay, don't get upset. Number 2, number 2, what the hell is going on here? Goddamn that Mavis. You know, she drives me crazy. Goddamn it, Harry, what's going on? Over. Shit. Stop playing with yourself and pick up the goddamn-- Uh, this is Harry, Mave. Over. Did you apprehend the suspect, Harry? Uh, no, I didn't, Mave. He got away about 10 miles north of town. I'm on my way back. Did you hear that? There's been a robbery. Floyd killed the guy. Honey, if I don't get back there, they are gonna know something's going on. God. Okay. Why don't you get a motel for the night? As soon as things have calmed down, I'll come out and pick you up. We can do it together. Maybe take a little nap, too. Sort of freshen up. [ howling ] I guess we better get her in the trunk. Just in case. It'll be safer. Oh. Jesus Christ, June, what happened here? The bumper's hanging off. Harry, you are standing here in the middle of goddamn nowhere with your dead wife in your arms, and you are worried about your fucking bumper. Well... Just put her in the trunk, Harry. You know something, June. You sounded just like Enid when you said that. Yeah. And sometimes you just piss me off so bad. Yeah, well, I didn't used to. Yeah, you're right. You didn't used to. Shit. [ siren wailing ] God. [ moaning on TV ] What the hell happened to you? Do you have any vacancies? Come by way of the sewer or something? What is with the third degree? I just want a room. It's a simple request. It's $25 tonight. Pay in advance. All right. You know, no guests. [ moaning continues on TV ] Room 10. I couldn't leave you out in the cold, now could I, Enid? At least it's warmer in here. MAN: [ on TV ] So get ready for the most dazzling extravaganza of all. We proudly present the best of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. On our 100th edition, we are privileged to present a portrait of our own Queen Elizabeth. Come behind the glittering public image... Ah! Incoming! [ indistinct muttering ] Oh, now look here. Thank you, Jesus. Hey! Woo-hoo. Woo-hoo. Oh, God. Oh. Yes. Oh. I know you want me. You've just been playing hard to get. I bet you can't believe your luck, because I'm gonna ride you like a Harley on a bad road. [ snoring ] Stuck in this motel. Harry is pissing me off so bad. Just as much his fault as it was mine. It's all gonna be over soon, Enid, I swear. Harry is gonna come over here and deal with this like he should have in the first place. Okay? Ahh! God. [ snoring ] Hello? Excuse me? I cannot leave you alone for one second, can I? Harry, I killed that man. You know, it was him or me though. There's no question. He looked surprised. I heard the shots. I was about to come in when I saw the guy running out. I figured I better go after him. You know, well, you did the right thing, there's no question. That's what I would have done. Except it makes me want to go. [ clock ticking ] Ahh! Ahh! What are these people doing here? I told you no guests. Well, Enid was-- she was sleeping in-- I don't care, rules is rules. Now you and your friends are gonna have to get the hell out of here. But you don't understand. Well, I don't care but, you know. TV set blaring, throwing parties. You're fucking crazy, you know that? Phew. Well, if you're not out of here in 5 minutes, I'm calling the cops. Well, this is just great, Enid. You are starting to really piss me off. Oh, my God. Let's just-- [ screaming ] I cannot take it anymore. Do you hear me? No more! Okay? Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Really appreciate it from the very bottom of my soul. Exactly what I needed today. Exactly what I needed. Well, you see, Officer, we were-- we were crossin' this bridge here, and, uh, this tree just fell across the road, and she swerved and... I mean, Enid had had a hell of a lot to drink. And she just sort of... ...missed the bridge. She must have hit her head on something, like, the window or the dashboard, maybe. Luckily, I managed to jump out just in time. Bye, Enid. Oh, God. [ muffled talk ] Oh, I think I got it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Joe. Wait a minute. Look, over on the road. Thank you. Thank you, God. Thank you. Holy shit, there's a dead body. There's a dead body. All right, all right, now calm down, honey. Just hold your tiny horses here. Would you mind repeating that? Uh-huh. Oh, boy. All right, where are you now, honey? All right, just, um, we're gonna send the car out there right away. You wait right there by the phone, right where you are. All right. That was a couple of kids. They say they just witnessed a murder out by Sanchez River. Harry, it's your cousin Annabelle. God, where the hell is Floyd? There's been a murder by Sanchez River. Hello. Harry, you are gonna be so proud of me. I did it. I finally did it. Did what? Dumped her. Oh, God. That's great. God, honey, that's the best news I heard all night. - Where? - Sanchez River. - Where? - Sanchez. About three miles north-- You dumped her in the Sanchez River? Yeah. I'm so relieved. I can't believe it is finally over. I mean, I thought I was startin' to lose it, Harry. I mean, for a minute there, I thought-- Oh, my God. Holy shit. Come on, Harry, let's go. I'll be right there. - Wait for me in the car. - All right. Now hurry up. Harry, what's wrong? What's going on? Honey, someone saw you dump the car. They just called. June, you have to try to get the car out. Do you hear me? Get the car out fast. We're on our way out there now. [ engine revving ] I dream of nights like this. Yeah. Come on. Floyd, for Christ sake, we're only going to talk to a couple of witnesses. Harry, the guy might still be hanging around. After dumping a body? Give me a break. God, Harry, when are you gonna start to learn to think like a criminal? Goddamn it! Get up! Get up! Ahh! God shit. - Zip it up. - You called us? Ugh. I got to go, Floyd. I'm going to the river, you stay with them. No. Harry, come back. What did he do that for? Goddamn it. Move over. I'm commandeering this vehicle in the name of the Las Moscas police force. I've been having a little trouble with the starter. She will start if you're a little patient. Son of a bitch. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Sir, can I-- God Almighty. June. June. Is this it, Harry? Am I arrested? No, honey. But you will be if we don't get this car out of here fast. Floyd's gonna pull up any minute. Now look, you stay here, I'm gonna get a rope down to you. We're gonna tow it out. Mavis, it's not my damn fault. Harry just took off in the car. MAVIS: [ on phone ] What do you mean took off, Floyd? - Whose car? - My car! I don't get it, Floyd. Your patrol car? Oh, Mavis, you're so dumb. Would you listen to me? [ engine turning over ] Oh, my God. Are you okay, Harry? Harry? Tie the rope to the rear axle, June. Where's that? In between the rear wheels, June. [ indistinct chatter ] No, no, no, no. What are you doing? We're gonna have to torch the car. We? What do you mean "we"? I'm not gonna have anything more to do with it, Harry. - I'm going home. - Well, go on then. [ sirens wailing ] We'll put her in the trunk. [ farting ] - Oh, God. - Been doing that a lot. I'm off duty in an hour. Go back to the house, I'll meet you there. We're gonna figure something out. June? - Harry. - What? Nothing. Hurry up, June, for Christ sakes. You don't understand. Didn't mean to do it. It was a mistake. She made me do it. She's the one that's doing this to me now. It's just weird or something. And it isn't you at all, God, is it? It's her. It's her playing the games. Oh, God. Ahh! Shit. Looks like you got yourself a little problem here. Oh, why don't you just arrest me? Get it over with. For what? For killing my sister. What? What difference does it make? Come on. I'll show you. Ma'am. [ screaming ] Holy shit, you're alive. Get your feet. Get your feet in here. Jesus Christ! I only hit you with that clown. You tried to hit me with that tire iron. You tried to kill me, didn't you? You thought that it was me opening that trunk. Harry's just not gonna believe this. Oh. Oh, he has been going crazy. He really has. I mean, he-- he's gonna be so overjoyed that you are not dead. I'm sorry I hit you with the clown. He's gonna be so happy. You know something? So am I. Harry's just not gonna believe this. [ horn honking ] Jesus. Oh, Harry. You can move your car. [ screaming ] I ran out of gas. So you're my taxi cab, got it? Taxi cab? Why am I his taxi cab? And drive me back to your house before these scumbags track me down. I'm not going anywhere, I'm gonna stay right here, that's it. - I'm not taking this anymore. - Honey, don't get me ugly. - Now drive! - I'm not just doing anything. I ain't feeling too charitable, chicky. You step on it or you die. You got that? Do you copy, huh? [ indistinct rambling ] Will you shut the fuck up? Lady, you just ran out of luck. Oh, God. You're all out to get me, aren't you? Every single goddamn one of you. Well, I am not gonna take it anymore. Will you stop this fucking car? I'm gonna get out of here. I'm getting out of here. Where the fuck are you going? [ siren wailing ] Harry. Listen, buddy, I got some bad news for you. It's Enid. We found this. Body was burned beyond recognition. It's cinder, Harry. I'm talkin' Cajun style, man. I mean, completely burned up. Leave out the graphic detail, will ya? [ wailing ] Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry, buddy. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, Harry. Harry, you want some company? Oh, no, Floyd. I think I'd rather be alone. Oh, June. Is June sleeping or is she just pretending? Hey, Jackson. Goddamn. Setting fire to the car in the middle of town wasn't exactly what I had in mind, honey. It's a little risky, you know. [ groaning ] It's okay. We made it. It's all over now. Hey, you still mad at me? Come on. Oh, baby, you must be exhausted. Oh, God. He really loved that woman.
