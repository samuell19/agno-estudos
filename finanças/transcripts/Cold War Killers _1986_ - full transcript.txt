Jones you were the passenger on the last flight three years later he married his widow fine man he may have been a good enough pilot but he was also a damn selfish bastard you didn't say that 27 years ago we were in the same squadron we didn't rat on your base at least not in all doctor didn't so why I said no I wasn't married to his widow 27 years ago he's come to think of it I hadn't even met Margo's in when I fell in love with the last well I learnt about Johnny I'm sad to say did you mug is a decent enough woman Steerforth got her pregnant and then lost interest in her and she gotten bigger played around you know I know you know bloody files I'm surprised I hadn't been chucked out in the weeding process service I actually sir you haven't been talking this thing personally since 1956 hardly I was at Oxford what are you some sort of military intelligence I think so this is my first day on a new job I tell you something else I didn't mention 27 years ago I didn't believe he was dead neither did Tiernan or Morrison why not no it's too damn convenient as you know it'd been up to his old tricks oh come now mr. Ottley dead lips okay you must know yes Iseult events are done in the last flight yes the last flight they were on to something really big I wasn't in the crew so I wasn't in on it but believe me they were very excited they were like schoolboys with a copy of health and efficiency bill how did it go no suspicious characters turned up often dr. Audrey and myself how did he get on last I saw he was driving off with Jones got foot-in-the-door East now you don't misunderstand me this is business and not all our business is good clean fun I have been here a year in their house we want you to keep a close eye um David on dr. all he's removed sideways to a good job and Viner him under that academic exterior he'll be fuming David always insisted that the Middle East desk couldn't run without him and others would agree but his intelligence analysis didn't suit the Arabists in FCO particularly Llewellyn that everybody in Berlin that it I'll have you back with the crabs painting the runways at Bryce North all due respect sir I'll be very happy to get back to my proper profession mmm when you work for me at this precise moment and this is your brief monitor David orderly while formally attached to this case as his - I see and report back in writing twice weekly to me under protest christ almighty must not mean trade union meeting and then replied your next question it's none of your business whether or not a copy of your report will go to the following Commonwealth Oh actually my next question was going to be do we have a code name allocated to this inquiry yes Lucrecia you Krisha yes come over itself operation Lucretia god so then what did he say but Jones oh he he recounted how these Russians have hung around pretending to be Hungarian refugees air force their story was that they'd had a contract with Steerforth's to smuggle some kit into the country and where was the trunk had there been a trunk Jones didn't know he never saw the cargo hold however he introduced them to a crowd of real Hungarian freedom fighters and I gather that the Magyars weren't 100% pro-russian and that was the end of it oh here's how Jones described one of them about five foot ten brown hair brush straight back piercing eyes a very determined looking bastard you go panning the wreckage of a plane has been discovered the aircraft serial number reveals it to be a Pembroke of Transport Command which the RAF announced was reported missing in December 1956 only one body has been recovered and that's the lead - welcome back mr. Steerforth your resurrection might not be in a minute the door I'm sorry look I know this is a bit of an intrusion no not so retracting right mr. tempus I'm sorry I shouldn't have come I'm glad you

stepfather saying he was a thief a cheap little crook nicking stuff out of Berlin and Hawking it on the black market now my parents are fighting with each other frightened in case these weird people

a week Monday naturally I just look I love her it's just I don't know what the hell to give her I hardly ever get to see them you know it's a problem when Laura left me we hadn't got around to kids maybe that was the problem the apartment of our airforce attache was burgled last Thursday it foolishly left some classified papers in his briefcase so copies are now circulating all over MLD right are you asking me or telling me Jake would you tell me if I asked you would you trust me if I told you son of a bitch I guess I would the results would certainly have been circulated to the Middle East desk and you no longer work there news travels far so you would guess I would guess the British service had nothing to do yeah so what can I do for you it's concerns ego Penny's a crushed Pembroke pennant Berlin nineteen fifties there you have me David you're a couple years older than me all that Suez Cold War time is a closed book to me I'm afraid apart from lectures at Staff College why don't you ask Theo Theodore Friedmann never heard of him oh he's one of our great Nazi hunters some say the thinking man's Simone Vicente try this he's in a man to guard or with just a hint of drugs correct Spanish his science thanks so dan in their lien what else according to our files we picked up a Russian agent following the murder of a norwich jeweller who used to buy certain items from the pilot at the Pembroke that was years ago well his pirate was in the jewel trade excellent sherry really nutty which is gracias so the Russian agent had connected the jeweller to a slow-burning gas cooker which he seemed to imagine would help further his inquiries and then what did this Russian want he was too frightened of his masters to say but he did mention some boxes and some Nazi outfit in Berlin for Suge thumped fear baby knowing you know what this was frankly the Second World War and the Third Reich have never been my cup of tea I think someone has leavened your present cup of tea with a strong dosa paraquat any chance of you being touch less obscure don't you know it is clear to me my dear sir that you have been assigned to an Inquirer where your personal safety can no longer be taken for granted I just hope you have not been followed here and a briefing for the team at the Australian High Commissioner on the same something as a firm broken pie coming off well it's in David Aldus hands he's not ready an affair with the routine for a field investigation is he completely on his own or do you have on someone's senior keep it'll watching brief first question john-boy tell me this is absent from Middle East desk arising much comment Linda King John Smith nothing more than a few sighs of relief still have been reading as analysis showing the line well inform perhaps tiró David is a touch too honest Alec I mean I would hate to use the term naive incidentally the word is he still hand him dad with the red sea pedestrians yes oh very chipper she took a bit of a tumble of dig up school point-to-point last Saturday burger damn devil food yeah it's nothing personal particular David or palak whatever gave you that idea okay adopt oddly isn't here just now stare forth all right mr. Frizzell tell him thank you fine grace the squadron leader has he left an envelope for the boss no did doctor oddly mention he was selling his car no won't get much for it it's hardly worth three foreigners trekking out to his farm house is it that old banger I'll say not why Pembroke's you're a dead little boy I've just got the latest jet fix range perfect I had something larger than mine mr. Madison larger I'm sorry unless you compute up the scale drawings double the size bit tricky though life-size life-size having me on another sport life sighs this is a model shop you are oh one nine four five three six sergeant Morrison Thomas Anthony now don't tell me I want something in a 40 year old raffle what's the problem the problem is yours friend and don't play dumb the papers and TV have been full of the discovery of your old kite gee George one-one-one m-mike squadron Transport Command I'm Rosco mo de sécurité we've reopened the file and quite frankly sir you're in trouble the pack of lies you've been caught up in lies I haven't so let's have the truth now shall we it's a pity to go to prison for something that happened nearly thirty years ago isn't it now look I didn't mention the boxes that the formal inquiry says we all thought johnny sniffles that fate is Devon and scarpered with it you know was a big one and you hoped by keeping quiet dear old Steerforth would turn up one day with a fistful of reading more or less what was in the boxes holy Johnny knew and Burt pilot officer Tierney I was just a lookout Jake solemn feel Astrix is ask him at forcing some 4p how much does he know it gives the impression he knows nothing it's not an impression to be relied upon did he give any hint what panel is after I will keep in touch so I told him not to leave town do you think you will I doubt it and we'll see the only lookout on the last flight no hue we can't have these loose ends hanging around all over the shop by the way I found the office grace says that faiths tearful a telethon I think it's time we paid another visit to mr. Morrison now that you've softened them up a bit and they said that was a fairly yes well you can stop being so damn courteous and call me David right we'll sorts death sir how do you mean dead as in not breathing's no finesse please be very good you and you don't exist as far as the police are concerned and the first hint from the pathologist is broken neck as Hugh likely diagnose it was an accident won't make sure thing in my knowledge then called Friesland he thinks we're saving it for some murky area well penny71 to shrink from getting nasty so there was a chance big was put no not as far as the local law a concern but whose report does mention a female traffic warden outside Morrison's shop yeah well I didn't who was paying her but it wasn't the local council air traffic wardens were changing shifts at the time grace get me mr. paws on the line simply stated I'm having a lovely time I hope it's not too soon after the funeral my father's been dead for years was upsetting for mum of course but I never knew him more or less walked out on her he died before I was born coincidence her marrying someone from the same squadron really mom was a long way from home the squadron was their closest family in a way tell me about the chaps that wanted to buy my car just three blokes really foreign hardly a word of English between them what exactly do you do at the Ministry of Defence David Lee what sort of ages I don't know two three blokes really middling kitchen of yours it's really evocative it's like those ads on the telly for home baked bread height faith I really do need a better description of them tell me something if I can did you ask me out tonight for business or personal reasons that's what's troubling you well you can put your mind at rest I certainly don't know you well enough to presume to ask you for a date so it's professional of course and the meal and the pleasant surroundings make it less less formal is that it something like that it's all paid for by HMG stop it next time you want to interrogate me I suggest you go and get them warrant or whatever faith Mystere for meto Oh it's against their cell peace for the illegal to visit the embassy come on everybody in London knows every Israeli spy so I gave you a shopping list already what have we got for you take we have been slaving night and day meetings with the British us end of the briefings monitoring the PLO they all take a back seat for our chief undercover level what was all that about your daughter's birthday cut the crap on deal right you asked for an update David oddly the Soviet embassy spook called Gloria Alexander which is be sniffing around over this house and generally keeping tabs what's the radio traffic like Soviet embassy to Moscow to separate increases unexplained from the Soviet embassy proper and from the aeroflot's managers house in hanket so this Pembroke must have been carrying quite a large cargo it's a stupid question but what was in its home when they found it in the lake nothing apart from legitimate cargo the cupboard was bare so Steerforth must have gotten rid of whatever it was he was carrying between telling the crew and passengers to bail out and crashing and crashing into the lake and who apart from Eagle Palin knows what steer thought Nick from Berlin who indeed not you by any chance scouts honor Wow this is a pleasant surprise I feel rather stupid now inside you must be hungry alright alright no need to rub it in what is it well I take it this is a social call came to apologize I suppose that social good it's just that I've been so wrapped up in work I hadn't really looked on you as a bit of crumpet don't get my special anyway it's it's I who should apologize oh my god a spark of gallantry so I make a big pot of it on Sunday night and it lasts me for the rest of the week don't you get bored with it you know at all Tuesday I converted to ragout by adding some wine on first year judicious leavening of paprika changes it into goulash and on Friday the remains become David or Lee's famous Korean oh my god what about Saturday ah well as a reborn Bachelor of eligibility one generally gets invited out on Saturdays you were married once hmm eight years how about you after steady boyfriends once got serious it happened after eight years or would you rather not say divorce civilized divorce is never civilized she

questions so case yes do you know why I got them yeah eggs gimme so no certain Roman general kept geese outside his camp the their cackling warned his sleeping arm he hit the enemy attempted a sneak attack well they don't cackle if anyone comes up the front pathways they're used to that discretion astonish you we saw not to put too fine a point on it oh no no no I'm afraid of confession let's find out after they good impression 71 Russians David what exactly's gosh David Onley this is some elaborate plan to get me into bed my dear young lady then it's quite all right by me really good old you're not one of these query intelligence men we've been reading so much about are you is it quite safe to venture out now dr. Hoadley what time just give work you know exactly where I work of course but I don't know what time you have to be able to school just my immediate rush shouldn't we see if I suppose prognoses still here beast but to wait it out what just gets you in this is what they teach you of the Ministry of Defense surprisingly something that I got the hang of all by myself I really don't see why I can't have a bath because I don't want you blown to bits red David look we were broken into last night's you heard them I heard them Vicki said and this morning there's not even a broken pane of glass so nobody broke in they did old Uncle David straps work with the most careful prowlers this house has been well turned over dear girl by experts god what a horrible feeling no I found a passage to the front door without making any bangs so follow me and we'll phone the office from a local call box show me they booby-trapped the place well either that or we're wired for sound of course we should speak mustn't let these people grind you down bunch of impotent nonentities a lot of them Colin got a job for you nah me boss I was night 2g Technical Officer jelly's late or anything off take take a team I wanted and then actually two teams I want a demolition sweep and a check for electronic surveillance the doctor over this house that's a dress shirt on playing football this afternoon I'm rostered off as of 20 minutes ago and you better take three cars in case you need to leave one for dr. oddly also take two close escort from the muscle home no service for a we salvaged it from that embassy fire I'll get it licensed chicken a bath in there and she said all clear vision and I said where the place isn't gonna blow up as far as I can see so in she doors taps on ear off bubbles I didn't know you use pebbles sir I also have a cockerel duck I take it we're clear for banks yeah far as I can see the debuggers aren't through yet oh gosh why for sound exactly bleepers swell if they can follow your car sir I do know what a believer is Jenkins the first one the obvious MacGuffin is intended to be found correct right and this boat is intended not to be a fire and the boat is also bleep oh yeah and of course there could be a third well there could be but this is a check device they supply them for every known make of vehicle Warsaw Pact funny people use them Jenkins sure locate and identify all the docking devices in and around the house top and just one thing is it remember that lecture we gave to Special Branch lost country house weekend where you've got all tired and emotional and proposed to miss Marsh when Chief Superintendent Brady fell off the fire escape from broke his hip flask that's one got it right you are chief what was that all about a lecture about turning electronic surveillance to advantage don't know how you can get so enthusiastic about all these things I want you to drive faith to Newton Chester or crane to a hotel whose faith she comes see you rather take him to field work what's the name of this hotel Paul you don't say good morning mr. forth you know somewhat different out of uniform it's called ringleader or if you changed jobs since we last met I he works with me faith I've a request to make I'd like to take you out of circulation for a few days and keep you out of trouble I'm serious so that's two rooms at the bull Hotel is that right sir what 180 weren't it David right then I'll see you later David words all over town Israelis a tapping orde-lees every move sir but our friends from the Moscow Ring Road what him in that clumping round like Inspector Clouseau slipshod are they hmm professional enough I suppose not quite the standard we've come to expect from the KGB earlier I suppose they are KGB yeah boy you tell me so be painful as they're giving it low priority though word is Palin's on a plane from Moscow this very moment so they must be taking it seriously excellent then things are going according to plan sir what if David finds the real Pembroke they must be lying around somewhere that would be a trifle embarrassing then perhaps it might be prudent if we took him a bit more into the picture if David is to be a complete sealer for panning he must believe that we want this box is from and that the aircraft in the lake rarely is the Pembroke and the corpse such as it is really is Squadron Leader Stefan yes I understand all that some of what if he succeeds where everyone else was failed don't seek the Russians have tried we've tried and have died the question of that but we've convinced orderly chances are we've also got an independent I still think it's a risk bringing those two together but panin is a man of influence in Moscow we heard from our friends he's having trouble with the hawkers Ameland he's an old adversary of David's old respected adversaries just the sort of person he might confide in you just work the other way around all these years strange to be here I mean this was the aerodrome of my childhood mythology never been here before this your technique do you think perhaps I know the secret of my father's crash so doctor oddly or is it colonel just doctor what do you do apart from being spy all sorts of useless things bravissimo what do you play vogner it's a terrible thing how fascinated we Jews are by that man I suppose it's obvious why then why keep a bird in the cage where else could he go can you see little Herman here fighting with pigeons and fag like London's powers for a crust on the embankment how close do you believe we are to another war another big one closer than anyone will ever admit why well early what was in those boxes it absolves so long ago something which Hitler ordered to be burnt along with the rest of Gestapo records Steerforth nicked them believing they contained not salute our treasures but he crashed and four people have been murdered why babe 1946 a handful of Russian and Nazi intelligence officers had of necessity become aware of the contents of the boxes stolen from the for exempt by flight leftenant steer forth the Soviets were so concerned to keep the contents forever secret that they organized the murder of everyone concerned in the affair the operation was run by Eko Panama but one intelligence officer survived I take it I'm talking to him I am the only man alive doctor outside the Soviet machine who knows what was in those boxes no one else not even the Israelis will you tell me why not that was the main runway according to the states love your father developed engine trouble as he cleared the Belgian coast by the time he was over the Humber he was on one engine which he reported his rough smirre he had his jump know he then got down safely he landed it's all in the fire but then he took off again every shot it's not clear on that point but the chaps who wrote the log was Stifler's for accuracy if it says landed taxied took off he circled assumably intending to land again then quite suddenly the remaining engine packed up managed to get the others ID safely but by then it was too low for him to jump as we now know he ended up in a lake about 60 miles from here right Yuto this is loaded and I'm happy to use it can I help you utopia I am looking for utopia is sorry to give you a start I mean some right queer fucking about these parts what kind of people a couple of foreign-looking blokes this one of the men could be that's the man that was hanging around David's house a couple of days ago he said he wanted to buy his car Ministry of Defense you say well I'm still not selling what these blokes they said they heard the old airfield was up for sale well it's not I'm an application for planning permission in charlie dwellings and a swimming pool a couple of good summers I kiss the pigs and sheep goodbye it always turned it into an open prison take a closer look please mr. Warren and I do assure you the ministry is not interested in acquiring this airfield then what were you doing here just after the war somebody lost something now everybody in this brother is trying to find it this is a bloke and they did most of the speaking foreign chap I caught him searching this old control tower dead a night scurry F your Trudeau average look please Fermi at the bull hotel if you see him hanging about and don't try to speak to him this is important fairly important yes I hope you and mr. Smith have a right to enjoyable stay miss thank you thank you sir you'll be mr. Smith man i Thompson Thompson room 26 single hey do you think you like this guy's here what exactly does David do at the Ministry of Defense he's just a civil servant really like you pretty boring really I've seen quite a bit of freezer fund of knowledge old seal yeah nice fella Jake what do you think's in those boxes surely freeze let old you he told me the Czar's crown jewels I can't help you quite play games David someone is playing a game with you you want some advice if it's free go for panning my people think he wants to talk to you to me that's what they think you're such a tease so design it click I have it on excellent authority that they discussed operation Lucretia in great detail the name Pantene was banded around and confidential sources of the intelligence service were mentioned it really is a most serious breach yes I see well thank you for bringing this to our attention mr. Llewellyn this is not to be taken lightly dr. Orly has acted in complete disappearance - in order to keep clear of the Mossad with whom he became a Mike - Palli while he worked on my desk if the point is noted sir I should be making a formal request to your dg2 have already voted out of the service I take it you are joking so I really can't permit you to rifle uglies desk who's that done you the courtesy of warning of my intentions so that your own report and advice cause it come to me alongside that for my own desk at FC I trust commander that you get the message oh yes sir loud and clear large scotch right sir I've just lost 50 P you only need to turn you get three goes for fifty kill the barmaid still there sometimes okay fill me up all of the old air ministry and security service files one of the blokes murdered in Berlin the first time around was the DG's brother Bill Russell filled security check second point of considerable interest is the actual crash contrary to what we well I certainly assumed the plane landed on one engine got the end of the runway going maybe a mite too fast and took off again how did you know that because I'm beginning to understand how that rather likable pirate squadron EDA steer fourth Jay actually operating last week a Daanish Korean I get angry challenge every door on this device will you be cross if I ask you something what's that young lady you're not still furthering your inquiries are you cool I mean here in this room well you don't think I do professor panic what very great Jack Vasa Archaeological Society I'm helping out this country visit of course you are commander and I'm sorry Nikolai the second shall we dispense with this comedy right I'm here to tell you the dr.
