[water dripping] [metal clanking] [creaking and clanking] [metal creaking and clanking] [Mueller] What were you thinking? [Michael] Ernie. [sigh] So what brings you to these parts? We're opening an office in this podunk town, what do you think? He hurt Anna. This is China. You shouldn't have hit the guy. I love her. You need to leave now. You're being deported, Michael. No. I've got to go see Anna. Forget it. She's under house arrest. No contact, no way. I'll see you on the other side. Michael Vance. Nice to finally meet you after all the e-mails. Stanford Lau. You as well, man.Hey, let me get that for you. [Mei Mei speaking Chinese] [Anna speaking Chinese] [Stanford] Ooh. You see that? Now that's Hong Kong. You know, so everyone at IT is still talking about your appointment. Yeah? [Mei Mei, speaking Chinese] [Stanford] So, we're a bit far from the office but this area is really good for shopping. Everything okay? Yeah. It's a personal matter. I'm sorry if I-- It's okay. It's a bit far from the days of us writing code at Stanford, huh? That's right, you're class of 2001. My freshman year. Look at you now, you're head of IT security. Well, it's not as glamorous as it sounds but yeah, I'll take it. Your new home is coming up right here on the right. Fully furnished corporate flat. The concierge will take care of whatever you need except that he doesn't speak English. Mueller will meet you on Sunday for lunch. A private club. Tr√©s chichi. The Chairman likes that sort of thing. Just show this to any taxi driver. He'll help you out. That's okay, I prefer public transportation. It's a long bus ride. You're going to need it. I'll manage. See you on Monday. Not at eight. That's too early for me. People tend to work late here. I'll be there. [Jessica, off] Michael, you've been a civilian for almost a year now. I think we both know that your two tours weren't exactly easy on us. We just... [Jessica, off] We don't laugh anymore. I'm sending the ring and your bronze star to your parents. And I'll put the rest in storage. [whispering] Sorry. [crying] I'm so sorry. [angry growling] [more growling] [panting] [crying] [Mei Mei speaking Chinese] [no audible dialog] [Mueller] Captain Vance? Ernie Mueller. [Michael] Please. Call me Michael. Okay, Michael. I appreciate your service to our country. Thank you, sir. You have quite an impressive record. First tour Force Recon. A G-2 desk in Kabul. I'm especially intrigued by your intel work. You know, tracking down high value targets. That information is classified. Son. I have contacts and I know things. Anyway, you met Stanford Lau. He's your point man. You can get started on the project right away. That's the reason you're here. Yes, sir. Now, let's go have some lunch. Do you know what Dim Sum is? Psst. So, what's he like? Who? The Ballet Master. Victor?Mm. Well, he was a principal dancer at the San Francisco Ballet decades ago. [chuckle] Sometimes he still thinks he is. [boy] But Victor will definitely keep you on your toes. And he likes to repeat himself. [Victor clears throat] [piano music stops] Ladies. Gentlemen. Good morning. Ms. Wang. Do you have something to say? Sorry, Victor. Please. Call me Mr. Young. Sorry, Mr. Young. [giggling] [Victor] Here at the Star East Dance Company there is no room for idle chatter, gossip, or giggling. We're here for one thing, and one thing only. To be the best. So, please. Continue. That includes you. Yes, sir. Barre work starts no later than eight A.M. every morning. No exceptions. If I do not see you here by 8:05, you will not work out that day. It will count as an "absent". Three "absents", and you are suspended. I do not like to repeat myself. Have I made myself clear? [both] Yes, sir. [Victor] We are preparing a new program to the music of Bach's Unaccompanied Cello Suites. There will be five solos. Competition for these roles will be open to all. Newcomers included. Auditions will be held in three weeks. Who will decide? Ms. Gabrielle Wilkins-Jones, our Artistic Director, and I will be making the decision. [Victor] Yes, Ms. Wang. She's a legend in the dance world and we should all be grateful for her guidance. Since you are new in town, I'd advise you to skip the night life. Listen to the program music carefully. Devote yourself to honing your English language skills, and perhaps take some acting lessons. And one more thing. Ms. Wang. Ms. Zhou. Welcome to the Company. Trying to hack us, are you? [typing] [Stanford] Nice try. Your logic bomb failed. Your remote access Trojan crashed. So did your rootkit. You want to try again? [sigh] Maybe later. I'm always willing to mash codes with a talented programmer. I'm always down for fun and games but I really need to get started on this new program. It's got to be quite the adjustment to go from the battlefield to corporate IT, huh? Not really. For one, they both require 360 security.Right. Because crackers can come at you from any direction. Well, from what I just experienced our cyber perimeter seems pretty secure. So far. What's that supposed to mean? You expecting something?Maybe. But that's why you're here. Right? [soft piano music] Such lovely form. Forgive me. Edison Poon. On behalf of the Board of Governors I would like to officially and personally, welcome you both. Really? Yes. I--and the Board, are keen to ensure that all our dancers feel at home. So please join me in toasting your arrival. How? How splendid you both look today. Thank you.Welcome. Oh, no thank you. I don't drink. [Edison] Not even a sip? Nice view. I rather enjoy the view myself. On a clear day, you can see Lion Rock. And of course at night, when the lights come on, the view is even nicer. [Mei Mei] Excuse me, Mr. Poon? Edison? Do you have red wine? Well, of course. Excuse me. I do have something rather special for you. Thank you. 1992 Chateau La Tour. I hope you like it.Thank you. Uh, she needs some air. Not feeling well. Really? But we're on the terrace. Walking will help. Right? Yes. I will be okay. All right. Do come back soon. [sighs] So, where were we? You know, on a clear day you can see Lion Rock. Oh. Sorry.[Anna speaks Chinese] [Michael speaks Chinese]Sorry. [Michael chuckles] Please. Thank you. You're welcome. [Michael] All right. So, I've been looking at these IP addresses. They seem to zigzag all across the globe. Just looks like a bunch of dead ends. [Stanford] But several of these seem to ping back to Hong Kong. [Michael] So, what do you think? Well, I think, that you must be the new guy. Kirsten, Michael. Michael Vance, Kirsten Kwok, Senior Sales Manager, Greater China. Pleasure to meet you. Likewise. What are you still doing here? It's late. Just finishing up year end sales projections for the CMO. Oh, Ms. Fong. Chief Marketing Officer, And you don't want to mess with her. Oh, don't worry. I've got years of practice managing up. So what do you do in your free time? Uh, depends. Learn Chinese.Really? Well, do you have a teacher? No, but I've got this. [woman's recorded voice] You know, learning Chinese isn't easy at all. [Kirsten] The tones can really throw you off. It's better to have a teacher. Call me if you want private lessons. [Stanford] Well, I need private lessons. Hold on. [click] [ringing] [beeping] [Jessica's recorded voice] Hey, it's Jessica. I'm not in right now so leave a message. [long beep] [Michael] Jess, it's me again. Please just call me back. [beeping] Can I get a single malt scotch? Neat. Sure.Make it a double, please. Enjoy, sir. Thank you. [typing on keyboard] [Mei Mei speaking in Chinese] I'm Michael, by the way. Anna. [speaking Chinese] Oh... [speaks Chinese] Yeah, my Chinese isn't so great. Oh, my English no good. Oh, your English is much better than my Chinese. [conversation in Chinese] [Anna] Try. [speaking Chinese] See? Better. You're a pretty good teacher. [Mei Mei speaking Chinese] Michael? Anna. Hi.Hi. Hi. Tea? Okay, um-- Should we start with the basics? Okay. You start. Okay. Uh-- [speaking bad Chinese] Did that suck? No, no. You not bad. Then why did you laugh? Oh...Not laughing of you...er... Foreigner speak Chinese very cute. I correct? Er...Yes, please. Uh-- [conversation in Chinese] Not bad. Very good. Where did you learn English? Uh, my family speak some. And I learn in school. What kind of help do you need? More words. Oh, vocabulary. Well, that I can certainly help you with. [Anna, in Chinese] [Mei Mei] Yes. [rhythmic pounding] No. No. [pounding continues] [Mei Mei, moaning] [glass breaking] [classical music] [Mei Mei] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [volume increases] [music stops] [conversation in Chinese] And, uh-- What do you do? Uh-- [speaks Chinese] Guess. Um-- a model or an actress. Tell me I'm wrong. I dance. Oh. Oh. [clears throat] Modern ballet. Oh...ballet. I practice nine hours a day. Auditions for a new program start soon, so I need to be ready. Wow. That must be difficult. If you love something it is not difficult. [soft piano music] [Victor] No. No. No. I don't see any passion from either of you. You need to connect with each other emotionally. Stop thinking about the movement. What is the emotion behind this piece? Xu, when you touch Anna. I need to see it. I need to feel it. She needs to feel it. She needs to feel your passion. Music! [piano music] [music stops] [phone ringing] Stanford. What's going on, man? Of course, you're intruding. But that's never really stopped you before, has it? No, come on up. I'll buzz you in. [clatter of dishes] Too much. [door closes]Hey, man. [Michael] What's going on? I brought you a little brain food. You know, it wouldn't hurt to let the housekeeper in once in a while. It'll do wonders for you. Yeah. I'm sorry about the mess. It just got a little ahead of me. Well, at least you've got the lived in look down. So, what's up? [sigh] Hm? We've got a problem. We do? You... Aw, what are you talking about? Well, you're a certified workaholic. A true Hong Konger. New job. New city. I'm just trying to stay ahead of the game. Working hard. Right into burnout-land. Look, take some time off. Have some fun. Look, this is what I'd do. I'd go to Guangzhou on business. It's legit. Take in the sights. Kirsten's there. I, uh, I appreciate your concern but, I've just got some other things on my mind right now. [Stanford] Michael. you're here. It's now. No better time to take her off the pedestal. That's what I'd do. [Anna] I have idea! You new to Hong Kong. Me, too! We should meet at different places. So we can... [speaking Chinese] Mm-hm. Oh. Hold on. [speaks Chinese] Discover. Explore. Yeah, I would like that. Oh, we should start on the Kowloon side. [Michael] I know the perfect place for us to...[speaks Chinese]. [shutter clicking] [speaking Chinese] [repeats Chinese] [taped voice] Boring. Photos long. Bored? Tourist. [speaking Chinese] I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? Your smile nice. Smile more, should. You should smile more often. Yes. You, too. Maybe. Maybe. [chirping] [Michael] Wow, this park is beautiful. Oh, that's... That's pretty. Oh.I hadn't noticed that before. Yeah, Ma give me when I confirm. You're Catholic? Yes, my whole family. Really? Many generations. So you have brothers and sisters? No. My country has one-child policy. So, only one.Oh, yeah. That's right. Huh. So, do you have a boyfriend? Yes. No. No. You? Girlfriend? Uh-- [dry chuckle] Yes and no. Um-- It's complicated. Complicated. How complicated? I have got to get a life. Oenology? Are you serious? [Professor Granville] You must be able to predict the wine's future. Take for example this... 2008 Saint Emilion Grand Cru. A dark purple color is followed by lifted aromas of... [sniff] blackberries, currants, dried spice, and incense. But shows excellent fruit purity matched by finely grained and ripe tannins. [slurping] [coughing] [Stanford] Excuse me. Walking a fine line between varietal definition and rich opulence, this wine will reach its peak in five to seven years. You okay? I don't think it's ever going to reach its peak. Stop it. It's awful. This is what I like. It's got a nice oaky body with a hint of mulberry. Well, look at you, all smart and educated. Well, I'll let you in on a secret. I read it on the label. Cheers. Cheers. That was the worst class ever. It was the worst. I'll see you soon, okay? You better. What? Hey, Stanford! I'll talk to you soon. Bye. What are you doing here? I was going to ask you the same thing but I get it now. She is beautiful. Am I ever going to get a chance to meet her? Look. It's none of your business, but her name is Emma, all right? Let's go. All right, where are we going? [Stanford] I need a real drink. [classical music on piano] Well, should we give the newcomers a try? You have anyone in mind? [Wilkins-Jones] Anna Zhou? You can't be serious. Why not? She's hard working, dedicated, and she demonstrates artistry. Are you sure artistry is all we are discussing here? You know that's all I care about. And quite frankly, I was expecting a little bit more open-mindedness from you. [Wilkinson-Jones] But it's the centerpiece of the whole program, an emotional crescendo. It has to come from the heart. Just look at her. She's a little, shall we say... inexperienced. Thank you, Miss Kim. That was adequate. [Victor] She's been working hard. She may surprise you. Victor, I know you have a great eye for rising talent but I shall remain skeptical. [sigh] Miss Zhou. [Wilkins-Jones] Miss Zhou. Now! Thank you. [soft piano music] Gabrielle, do you think we have our soloist now? That will do. [Anna] Beautiful. [Michael] Yeah, it is. Just like dancing. Floating. Free. Just like wind. Worry about nothing. No worries. You okay? Uh, yeah, fine. You don't look fine. Oh no, I'm...I'm great. Um...it's just you and me and a... fifty meter drop. Oh, you afraid of high places. No, no. Actually, it's my ear. [exhales] Ever since, uh-- I was...wounded, I have trouble with...balance. Oh. Um-- come here. Okay. All right. I like clouds. They're funny. You mean fun to look at? Yeah, fun to look. Uhhh-- Like that one. Look like duck. Huh. [Michael] I don't see it. Relax. Imagine. Yeah, I got nothing. Must be my training. Too regimented. Feeling better? Hm? Much better. Anna, I was wondering-- [speaking Chinese] Well? You, I, [chuckles] mine, ours,Mm-hm. we go on date. So you accept? Okay. Under one condition. What's that? No language lesson. No book. You don't bring gadget. I can do that. Yeah? Deal? Deal. Okay, it's settled. We're going on a date. This was a great idea. Just need a second to get away, you know? Take a breath. Now what about your upcoming date with that pole dancer? Whoa. Ballerina. No pole dancing involved, man. A ballerina really? Yeah. For real. All right, fine. What she like? She's different. Is she hot? Beautiful. So she's got a personality. I get it. So, what's the problem? I don't know. You don't know? Well, have you seen her dance yet? No. Not really. You sure she's not a stripper? [chuckles] Yeah. So, that was interesting. But I kinda liked it. You did? But it was Canto-pop. Yeah, well, I'm not saying I understood most of it. Or any of it for that matter. But it had a lot of energy. Thank you for taking me. You're a very brave man. [Anna] Look. Photo? I go ask them. [conversation in Chinese] Oh, no, we're just friends. Look, I'll email to you. Okay. [speaking Chinese] Uh, this guy... [Michael] Uhhh...Let's see... that one looks like a... dog. [speaks Chinese] Okay. What about the one on right side? [Michael] Ummm...I don't know. [speaks Chinese] A horse? Really? No. You don't see starfish? No. I lied about the dog and the horse, too. I know. So how do you do it? How do you see beyond what's real? Free up your mind. Go away from the real things. So just forget about everything? Mm-hm. Your mind, clear it. Like computers and delete. Try it. It's not always that easy. Nothing ever is. The Chinese have ways of helping this. They do? Yes. Healing rock path. It ease the mind. Relax your body and release your qi. We can try... together someday. I'd like that. I'd like that a lot. Okay. That one... definitely looks like a...a...a-- [Chinese terms] Mm-hm. It certainly does. I know I'm a goofball. [Michael] Oh yeah, it's not so bad. Oh ow! Spoke too soon. Ow! Yeah! Ow! [Anna] Relax. My God, this hurts. Enjoy. What's there to enjoy? Pain is literally shooting through my legs. Because you bad circulation. Oh, I circulate fine, thank you. Look! It is good for you. Stimulate points in your feet. Yeah, it's stimulating some pain, that's what it's stimulating. Good for fighting stress. You need, no? Yeah, yeah. Or, or this is some kind of joke that you like to play on foreigners. No. Hey, it improve balance, too. Oh great, you're a show off, too. That's awesome. Ow. No, this good for you. I don't believe you. Challenge! You Marine? I used to be. Not anymore. Yes. Now you foot soldier. [Michael] So, Mei Mei, it's nice of you to join us on this beautiful foggy day. Yeah, thanks for the fog. Ha ha ha. You didn't bring a friend? Uh, no. Too bad. She don't like running. Oh...uh... Well...too bad. Uh...should we start? Yeah? Okay. No money. [Michael] So, how are your rehearsals going? Okay. Just okay? I'm a little nervous. The show is next week. I know. I bought a ticket. You did? Mm-hmm. I've never been to a dance performance before. I'm looking forward to seeing you on stage. Now I really nervous. I can imagine. Tickets are sold-out. That's really cool. Look at that. [speaking Chinese] How's that? [speaking Chinese] Uh...nothing. You need this. [speaking in Chinese] I don't need that. I've got you. For when I not around. Yeah but then I've got my tablet. You have too much electronic in your life. So, this is simpler. For you. [speaking in Chinese] Go for coffee. Yes. I told you I didn't need this. Because you have me. I guess you're right about that. [Victor] Anna? What's wrong? I'm thinking. How do you do it? The lights, the people. The applause. That's what we live for. To be the best. This is not your first solo. But it is my first solo here. It's different. Stand up. Don't let the fear overtake you. Don't let it cripple you. When you're on stage, don't listen to the music, feel it. You and the music... will become one. Reach deep inside. And use everything you have and imagine imagine that there's only one person in the audience and follow your heart. You're ready. [speaks Chinese] [recorded voice reads in Chinese] [voice repeats Chinese phrase] Yes is yes. No is no. Yes. I think I do. [soft cello music] [cello music continues] [music ends] [no audio] [Michael] You are an amazing dancer. I had no idea. All the time, I want to dance. Really? Mm-hm. Nine years old, I begged Ma to take me to first audition. "Dancer's life is hard", she said. She did not want me to leave so young age. Well, how did you know that's what you wanted to do when you were so young? It was my dream to be dancer. I...I just love it. Nothing can stop me from my dream. So finally my Ma agree. I left for Beijing Academy when I was ten. Wow. Any regrets? No. Except I miss my family. Sometimes I feel... very alone. Hey. You're not alone. [Michael] Hey. Hi. You okay? Mm-hm. It was wonderful. Yes, it was. But what about back home? It's over. Eat and run. You okay? Yeah. Fine. Why do you ask? You've been wearing the same clothes for the past three days. I'm starting to get worried about you. I've just-- I've got a lot of code to write. That's all. It's Anna, isn't it? You know... I know how she feels about me. I just, I don't know how I feel about her. I really don't know what to say to her. Look, it's, none of my business, but all I'm saying is forget the words. Listen to your heart. You need to get some rest, buddy. Oh! By the way, I got something for you. Really? Yeah, you need that. That's kind of you. Wait. Hey. Whatever happened with you and Emma? I'll catch you later, buddy. [beeping] [sigh] [phone rings] Mei Mei speaking. [speaking Chinese] Uh, Mei Mei, where's Anna? Well, if it isn't the great white hamburger. Sorry, she's switched to gateaux de boeuf now. What are you talking about? Don't you know? She's going to France. To France? [Mei Mei] Oui Oui. Her flight leaves...soon. Tonight? Mais oui. She's-- [beep] She's on the A-29 bus to the airport. Okay. What is the flight number? Sorry.Mei Mei. Mei Mei. What is the flight number? Too late. [Michael] Mei Mei. Mei Mei! Dinner was excellent. Spicy food always reminds me of home. Speaking of which, when are you leaving for Chinese New Year? I'm...not sure. Well, don't leave it too late. Otherwise, all the flights will be booked. I don't care. Family things... so boring. Well, if you stay, perhaps we can celebrate together. The fireworks are spectacular... especially from the bedroom. Well...to fireworks. [glass clinking] About the trip. Maybe you don't go with me to China. Why not? Isn't it a tradition to go home for Chinese New Year? Yes, of course. I go back every year even when I was at the Academy. But...a lot of family things to do. It is my duty, not yours. Anna, I know all about duty. Besides, what better way to spend my first Chinese New Year than with you in China? Unless you're trying to hide me from your boyfriend. No. I told you. I'm just kidding. No more. If you'll have me as your guest... I would be honored to meet your family. Okay. Come here. [church bell ringing] Anna. Is that your church? [Anna] No. Different. That one is Patriotic Catholic church. Bishop is state-appointed. Our church is what Western media like to call underground church. You know, your English is much better when you're angry. [Michael sighs] This is a journey. Don't worry, we're there soon. [Anna] Our church. [Michael] That's hardly underground. I was actually expecting it to be...underground. What? What's wrong? My grandfather, he's... Difficult? Don't worry. My Chinese is getting pretty good. I'll win him over with that. No. His English is good. [Michael] So, what's the problem? [Michael] Does he have something against foreigners? In Korea War, he fight Americans. [Anna] It wasn't good! Oh. [Anna speaks Chinese] [conversation in English] [Michael] I was. Not anymore. Afghanistan. [speaks Chinese] [speaking English] Vietnam. Korea. He commanded a mortar squad. [speaking Chinese] Yes. Three generations. [speaking English] [speaking Chinese] I fought for America with honor. [speaking Chinese] Mm. My father and grandfather also fought with honor. [speaking English] [speaking Chinese] [speaking English] I would be honored. That would be a good day. [speaking Chinese] They will also have my grandfather's blood and that would bring honor to both of our families. Yes. [chuckles] [speaking Chinese] [Michael] Oh... So, that's where you're hiding. Not hiding. Just thinking. May I join you? It is beautiful out here. Oh, look at that. You see that cloud? It looks just like you when you dance. Arms out... light, free... beautiful. You're making that up. No, I'm not. You're just at the wrong angle. Come on over here and you'll see. Hey. What's wrong? What about us? Did you mean what you say to Grandfather? I have to admit he caught me completely off guard. He made me realize how I truly feel about you. But what about when your job finish? I promise you I will never let anything keep us apart. [grandfather speaking in English] Yes. I am looking forward to it. [grandfather in English] Really? Is that okay? [priest speaking Chinese] [grandfather speaks off in English] And that allows you to practice religious services openly. [speaks in English] In what way? [speaking in Chinese] [no audible dialog] [Anna] [no audible dialog] Stop! [Anna] Michael! Anna! [thunder crashing] [speaking Chinese] [metal clanking] [creaking and clanking] [Mueller] What were you thinking? [Michael] Ernie, Gong Xi Fa Cai. Happy New Year to you, too. So, what brings you out to these parts? We're opening an office in this podunk town. What do you think? You should not have punched a militia officer. He hurt Anna. This is China. You should not have hit the guy. I love her. So, how bad is it? You're being detained. Pending identity verification.Really? What's that supposed to mean? It means they can hold you as long as they want. But I made a few calls and I cashed in a lot of chits. So you're out of here. Yeah? I really appreciate that. You know, you really made a mess of things. Yeah... I can't seem to get out of the line of fire. Well, you're on the six o'clock flight back to the States. No. I can't leave. I've got to go see Anna. Forget it. She's under house arrest. No contact. No way. Besides, there's no time. You need to leave now. You're being deported, Michael! Here. Take this. That's really generous. Thank you. I like you, Michael. You're my kind of guy. I hate to lose you. So Hong Kong is out? Yes, Hong Kong is out. Our interests in China take priority but you can work in any of our other offices. Your choice. Thanks, Ernie. But maybe in the future. I need to find a way to get back to Anna. I made a promise. [speaking in Chinese] [phone ringing] [beeping] [Michael, over machine] Stanford, is everything set? [Stanford] Yes, it's all in place. But you're on your own after you cross the border. Are you sure about this? Yes, this is a promise I have to keep, and like you said. Forget the words. Listen to your heart. [woman over speakers] This is the final boarding call for Flight FX 801 to Hong Kong. Please proceed to the gate immediately.
