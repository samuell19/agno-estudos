So, who's been taking care of your dogs? A next door neighbor. That's a mighty nice neighbor, watching after both dogs for three weeks. Yeah. One more stop in Arizona, and I'm headed home for a month. Thanks. Dinner comes to 6.95. I didn't charge you for the coffee. Thanks. See you on the way back through? Yep. I should've known it'd take more than a power outage to keep you from working all night. I just got rolling on something, that's all. Give your brain a proper rest, and you'll work better. I thought the deal was that I move back here to take care of you. So did I. But the way you take care of yourself, I'm not sure how much you can take care of me. You know that I have two generators. Ah, I thought it'd be too noisy. I didn't want to wake you. So what do you got there? Uh, this? it's a newsletter from the reservation. Sorry. All out of gas. The, uh, refueling tanker was supposed to be here last night. Not sure when he's gonna show up. Sir, my name is Hank Summons. Detroit, Michigan. Uh, I'm just passing through. Um... The tanker you're probably talking about is what I seen about 25 miles back. It seems to have blown up. Bad accident. I think we got a problem here. I'm calling the sheriff. Yeah, that tanker's, uh, blocking the entire road. Is there any other way out of here? Only way up is the 15. Shit, on the 15, it's at least another 150 miles to the next town. 173, actually. Look, this is a high-performance vehicle I have here. Nigga can't make it no 173 miles. I ain't got enough gas. Look, I'm from the city, right? This is not the city. I need help bad. I smell horse shit, and it's probably been a long time since you've seen a hundred dollar bill around this place. Sell me a horse, anything. Just get me the fuck outta here. Let him go! Let him go! Annie? Yeah? Hello? I'm here. Just got a call from a couple of Rob Horn's men. Looks like a truck crashed down near Hack Creek. Probably what caused the power outage. Power... What time is it? 6:48 a. m. Hack Creek. Um... Well, what did you say? Hack Creek, right? Yeah. All right. I'm heading down there right now. You sure? I mean, you sound kind of-- I'm fine. 6:48's early for me. Hey, I was just offering to check it out myself. Thanks, Luis, but, uh, I'm still the sheriff, remember? At least through this week anyway. All right. Then I'll meet you down there. I'll meet you down there. Whoa! Hey there, Annie Oakley. It's just me, your humble deputy. You know, one of these days, I'm gonna shoot you. I suppose startling a woman with a gun ain't the smartest thing to do. Yeah, well, I wouldn't shoot you for that. I will shoot you if you keep calling me Annie Oakley. What the hell is that? I'm not sure. I wonder what he's doing down here. Maybe Nodin can help us out with this thing. That was quick. Yeah. Well, it was important. You didn't tell anyone I was wanting you to take a look, did you? Of course not. What do you have? You say you found this at the crash site? Stuck behind the grill of the tanker. Must've come off whatever he hit. Yeah. Whatever that was. I've never seen anything like it. Well, l-- I was hoping you could be a little more specific. Uh, best I can do is I'll run a generic zoo blood on it. Thanks. And, uh, don't get your hopes up. It may come back with only basic information on what, uh, species you have here. That's a start. Hey. What happened to the driver? Didn't find one. Hey, Annie. Everything okay? Uh, what? Well, you came to see my granddaughter about something. Oh, uh, yeah. I'm... I just wanted her thoughts on-- It's nothing, really. Any idea when we're going to get power restored? I'm going to run out of diesel for my gennie. I'm looking into it. Why don't you hate me? I mean, you never-- you never even seemed angry. You and Nodin. I mean, I'd understand if you did. I've been around a long time. I've seen a lot of both-- hate and anger. Some might think it's a natural reaction. As far as I know, neither have led to retribution. Chief, you out there? Yep. Busy day. Looks like a wolf ate a couple of Rob Horn's cattle last night. He wants to talk to you. Perfect. Thanks. There. There it is. If it was a wolf, you'll be paid. "If"? I ain't playing here, Annie. I want 2,000 a head, including them calves there. Ain't gonna happen, Rob, and you know it. Government's maxing out at a thousand per head. 500 for each calf if you're lucky. - This is bullshit, Annie. - I hear you, Rob, but you're aiming your anger at the wrong person. I don't write the law. Hey, Kelly, get on out to those troughs and make sure they're full. Yes, sir, Mr. Horn. The electric pump's out, so we may need to do it by hand. We've been real good to you around here, Annie. Put up with a lot from you ever since-- well, over the last year. Hell, I even stood up for you a time or two myself. This job's a hell of an opportunity for somebody your age. You better be understanding you work for us. You need to be going to bat for us around here. That's your damn job. At least till the town meeting next week. I ain't fooling with you, and I know you ain't so drunk you don't know what I'm saying. Thanks for giving me that much credit. It means a lot coming from you. I'm going to kill you. Don't be such a bitch, Ally. Bitch? I'm moving all the way out to Hollywood so you can try and become the next Julia Roberts. All I'm asking is for you to navigate. And I did, okay? The Web site said this is the fastest way to California. I don't know what happened. Well, I hope you're right, 'cause it's been, like, 125 miles since we've seen a road sign. Or any sign of life, for that matter. How's that for your sign of life? Pull over. Pull over. Looks like engine trouble. Really? Ain't that a thing? I just came up with the same diagnosis myself. You must be a mechanic. Don't worry. He ain't going nowhere. I know. Got anyplace cool to keep this? Put it in the corner. What about the gas? Is it coming soon? Not sure. Hey, Grandpa. I need to get that case to Albuquerque, like, yesterday, okay? Comfortable back there? Could've been worse. Well, folks, I hope you don't need fuel. What do you mean? It means you're trapped. You're welcome to stay here tonight. Welcome to the party. Heard Horn lost another one of his cattle today. Yep. Afternoon, Sheriff. Hey, Carla. We can't be having our livelihood jeopardized 'cause of some damn wolves. Someone's gotta start standing up for our rights around here. - How's it going? - It's going. You know what would be a good start? If we got a real law person in here instead of some drunk woman. Don't pay any attention to them fools. There's plenty of us who know you're good for this town. Horn's cattle are already the talk of the town. It seems so. I wonder if she's taken out any little Indian girls today. Harlan, don't make me ask you to leave. Rob Horn looking for Sheriff Flynn. Over. Another cow gone missing. Somebody's ears must be burning. Want to talk to him? Do I have a choice? I got it, boss. I got one stop, and I'll be there before dark. Hey, Sheriff. Yes, Curtis? You coming to the town meeting? Yep. I'll be there. Hey, Carla. Town meeting's next week, right? Yep. So I'm still the sheriff today? Yep. That means I can still arrest people around here, right? I reckon so. Don't know why you stick up for her. Because she's decent people. You know what, Carla? I doubt the parents of that little girl would agree with you on that one. Hunter's at first. Oh. Um, hi. Can I help you? Yeah. Is Nodin home? Who's that? Finally, a cop. So when's the road gonna be opened back up? We should have it cleared by sometime tomorrow. Um, yeah. Nodin. Um, she's down the hallway in the greenhouse. Come in. Thanks. Annie. Think you can give me a hand here? Yeah, sure. What do you need? I'll put my hands under it, then you put yours, then we'll move it over to that table there. - All right. - All right. Thank you. Sure. Wow. You need-- You need all this stuff just to make a pot. We don't look at it as just making a pot. Creating pottery is about a connection with Mother Earth and our sounds and everything around us. It's a gift from our people. We look at it as we would an individual's life. So why don't we flip a coin for the couch tonight? Maybe we should just wrestle for it. - Wrestle? - Yeah. Tough guy. I haven't wrestled in a while. - I'm tough. - You are? Let's see. We take the clay and work it, develop it, cleanse it, take away any impurities and add what is needed to strengthen it. Only then can it be made into something beautiful and useful. But there is an ugliness that comes from the earth as well. A kind that can never be made into anything beautiful. Come in. There's something I want you to see. I don't want to wake up Grandpa. Grandpa's a little pussy. Yeah. Well, you see, we classify all living things under five kingdoms: fungi, protista, bacteria, plant... and, of course, animal. This polygenic dye is designed to attach itself to DNA from any of the five kingdoms. No! Take a look. There's a different colored marker assigned to each of the five kingdoms. The one that you're seeing there is the animal kingdom. So you're an animal. So what? So... I've run the test three times on this thing, and it's coming up clear. Nothing. The dye won't bind to it. It's, uh...a novel life form. And what the hell are you saying? I'm saying this thing is a bona fide unnatural organism. Harlan? Too drunk to drive. Curtis? If you boys need a ride, I can-- Harlan? Oh, shit! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Come on! Oh, God! This is not good, Kale. I was right. We were right. They didn't die because of the drought. I will. The interior of this thing is lined with them. - What are they? - I'm not sure. But look what happens when I add the dye. Whoa. The dye seems to be indicating that there's DNA from each of the five kingdoms encased inside those little chambers. DNA... What kind of animal carries around-- Look, I'm probably wrong. You really should take this thing to a proper lab. I'm way out of my field. I mean, I've studied plant DNA. It just...doesn't make sense. The test is pretty straightforward. Strange. - Shower. - I have one of those. Haven't had one of those in a while. We've been driving for a long time. Oh, yeah. What's going on? I, uh, thought you were a coyote rummaging around in the trash. It's best you, uh, be getting inside now. Okay. Um... I'm just going to go and, uh, go to bed. Good night. Good night. Oh, excuse me. - Who do you think you are? - Oh, I don't know. - Who do I gotta be? - Oh, you know. Oh, God! - What is that? - Fuck! Oh, my God! What happened to her? Get down! Where's your gun? Close both sides. Kale! She already saw it! Oh, shit! What's going on? Hit the lights! The roof! The roof! There! There! There! Shoot that fucking thing! Where is she going? Where is she going? Fuck! Shit! Gun is jammed. Grandpa! Get them out of here! Go! Grandpa! Let go! Get go of her! Get out of here! Go! Go! Get to your car! Get back! Come on. Follow me. Get in. I got her. Go, go, go! Take the dirt road! Yeah, to the left! Shit. Is that it? Is the thing dead or what? - We're fucked, man. - No, no. No, we're not. We'll be fine. We're close enough to walk. What are we doing? Where are we going? What the hell was that thing? What is going on? I don't know what's going on. I don't know what that thing was. We've got to keep going. It's probably best if we keep quiet, too. Now let's move. Where are we going? There's a guy up here who might be able to help us. Look, Mr. Horn, I'd be pissed off, too. I give you my word, we will get to the bottom of this. I wish I had as much faith in your boss as I do you, son. I think you ought to consider throwing your hat in the ring. I believe you've got the makings of a damn fine sheriff. Appreciate the support, but, uh, at this point in my life, I'd be lucky to be half the sheriff Annie is. Sorry to hear you got such a low opinion of yourself. Stay here. What the hell? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I hope this ain't the guy that's going to help us out. We might as well be waiting on Tupac. Where are we? We made it out. We're okay. Grandpa? He's gone, Nodin. Is Kale here? Not unless he's in there. Oh, it look real safe in here. Real safe. A kiva. What? An ancient burial room. Nodin, you come with me. The rest of you stay there. Holy shit. I guess we know what Kale's been doing down here. This is the thing that killed my grandfather. What the hell are they doing down there? Stay here and keep an eye out. He was right. It wasn't a drought. What? The Anasazi. They lived in these parts about 900 years ago. Then they seemingly just vanished. Vanished? Most historians believe it was because of a drought. This...shows a tribe in their day-to-day life. And... here we have what appears to be that thing showing up one day. What's that? Caya! Everybody quiet. Your friends cooperate, I'll untie them. Everyone is right. You are crazy. My grandfather died! - Your grandfather wanted to know the truth. - What truth? The kind of truth you get when given a voice for an entire race of people that were wiped off the face of the earth. The Anasazi were your ancestors. I thought you'd care more to see their lives were given some kind of resolution. Get up. Over here now. Now. Read it. They said he came from the sky. A god. They worshiped him... until he turned on them. Yeah, the university thought I was crazy, too. They stripped my funding, but I was right. No, you weren't. What? Annie retrieved a piece of this thing from the crash site. I found it in the grill of a truck. When I dissected it, I found a series of tiny chambers inside that contained all sorts of DNA from the surrounding area. Plant species that had been extinct for centuries. This thing isn't a god. It's some advanced civilization's scientific probe sent here to gather DNA. The strange thing is is that in lived in peace for a period of time, and then it suddenly turned, like a survivor mechanism had been tripped. Nearly annihilated the entire tribe until... whoever drew these petroglyphs made a poison to stop it. And now it's back from the dead? It was never dead. The poison-- it put it in a sort of suspended animation. The creature's skin developed some kind of compound that bonded with its cell protein... that acted like a protective chest. For 900 years. Like brine shrimp. Your grandfather-- His translation said there was an extract from the sunami plant... that helped make that poison. He was still deciphering the process. I need you to finish his work. Look, I get that in your mind, killing this thing is going to fulfill some sort of destiny that you think has been bestowed upon you. But I have a responsibility, too, and that's the safety of these people. So you're going to give me the keys to your SUV so that I can get them out of here. No. Keys, keys. Get up! You're going to give me the keys to the truck. Am l? Right now. Over there. I keep everything over there. Hey! The car keys-- behind the rock. You satisfied, Sheriff? I think I see something. Wait a sec. Oh, God. Hold on. Oh, fuck. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You son of a bitch! - No, no, no, no! No! No! No! - Step out of the way! Shoot the son of a bitch! Put the gun down. I'm the only one who'll know what she needs. What the hell's that supposed to mean? Antivenom. Sheriff, clock's ticking. Okay. We'll sit you down right here. It's okay. Help me. Help me get her down. Here. I need some room there right away. - Get him off me! - Hey, keep her calm! - Okay, okay. - Keep her calm. It's okay. It's okay. She's been hit with a baby rattler. A lot of venom. She's going to need two more doses every hour, okay? Hey! What's going on? Looks like you're going to have to finish your grandfather's work. Great. Why don't you start removing the spine so we can soak them in that bucket of lighter fluid? Lighter fluid? It was the only thing I could find around here to remove the lipid content from these things. "Lipid content." Big word. Should've guessed. I mean, making poison to kill aliens is, oh, like, old hat to you Indians, huh? All right, Kale. You got what you needed out of us. Why don't you fly Caya here to Rio Vista and bring back some help to get the rest of us out of here? I knew it. I told you this asshole ain't going to get us out of here. - She needs medical attention. - Really? Here. Fuck this. I'm taking the SUV, and I'm taking it as far as it'll take me. Fuck all you crazy motherfuckers. No one's taking my truck anywhere. Christ! Fucking maniac! Go, go, go, go! Let's go! Come on! Move it! Let's go! In the cave! Come on! Where's Nodin? She was right behind me. I don't know. Shit! [creature growls] Come on. Run! Move it now! Get them to the SUV. I'm with you. Get her out of here. I'll be right behind you. I'll be right behind you. Get them out of here! Come on! Move! What about Charlie? It's too late for him! Give me the keys! Give me the keys! Come on. Over there. Rob Horn's ranch. He'll have fuel. Let's go. Oh, my God! Luis! Rob! Rob Horn! Y'all better not have brought that creature back with you! Where's Luis? Oh... He must've crawled out of the barn after that thing got him. I brought him down here so he could be with me. He had these weird things attached to his body. I caught one of them. The little bastard's dead. It ain't moved since about 10 minutes after I put it in here. You enjoy yourself, darling. That Montrachet's 300 bucks a bottle. These tiny organisms must carry some kind of venom that produces paralysis. Maybe some kind of pre-digestive system. Maybe both. Seems as if they liquefy the internal organs-- bones, genes, everything. I saw what it did to the cattle and that trucker. It was this close to me-- inches away-- and then it just took off. Why didn't it kill me like the others? It sensed the poison. Then why didn't your darts work? Let's go find the others. What did you get? Follow me. They grounded the plants here. Uranium. Uranium is the catalyst that makes the poison work. When they ground the plants with this mortar and pestle, they were combining it with radioactive uranium. It wasn't described in the drawings because they had no idea it was part of the process. Uranium. This old cave is a uranium mine. I've got tools to extract uranium back at my lab. Hopefully, it's still intact. I ain't sure why that thing keeps coming back here. Probably-- Probably 'cause it always found food here. First the cattle, then the men. No one got out? We all come up from the big house in one truck. When the gas tank ignited, took her out. Left us all stranded here to fight for our damn lives. There's no vehicle to get us out of here? The only thing I got's parked down at that old wooden barn at the end of the road. It ain't been driven in more than a year. So the battery's dead. She ain't going nowhere. We got a battery. I got bit by a rattler one time. Hurts like a bitch, don't it? Yeah. Shouldn't she be back by now? Yeah. You'd think with all this alcohol waiting for her, she'd move a little quicker. What's that supposed to mean? It means the sheriff moonlights as the town drunk. Pretty much. Come on, Caya. You ain't seen her hands shake? Her hands shake harder than a $40 hooker shakes her ass. You're a jerk. She saved your life, and she's out there alone trying to save yours, too. I got it. There's a-- There's a gennie just outside that door. Okay. We got it. Take this. That's good. Here. Plug it in. You know, four years ago, when I first moved here to take this job, I'd never been happier to be anywhere. It was like I was in a place that I finally belonged. Been wanting a job like this in a place like this for, well, as long as I can remember. Funny, ain't it? You can work towards something and want something for years, but it only takes a second-- a split second-- for you to do something and take it all away. You know, I don't speak for nobody else around here, but it never seemed to square up right to me that you had to take that hit for that little girl's death. I got to hand it to you, Annie. You're a tough little broad. I guess I underestimated you. You're not going to get all mushy on me now, are you, Rob? Oh, hell, no. This ain't no apology. I still think your head's too deep in the bottle to be sheriff. And come that town meeting next week, I will vote your ass out. Let's just hope there's still a town to have a meeting about. Start the engine! Stop pumping the gas! You're flooding the engine! Son of a bitch! Come on, you fuck! Hit it! - What? - Hit it! Let's get the fuck out of here! What about the others? Fuck the others! What about us? Shit! Let's go. Rob! Let's go. You're alive. Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, are you okay? Where's Annie? Get out of here! - Go, go, go, go! - Let's go! Come on! Come on! Come with me! It will work this time. What are you doing? Here. This will protect you. Wait here. No! Oh, fuck! Sheriff Flynn, we got a call: 1031 with a child involved. 355 Patron Road, just inside the reservation. Up against the car! - Daddy! Daddy! - Hands behind your head! Sheriff, this is on tribal land. We are not authorized to interfere. - Hands behind your back! - Let him go! - Let him go! - Let go of my kid! Let go of my kid! - Let him go! - Stay back! Let him go! - Up against the car! -... understanding you work for us. ...taken out any little Indian girls today. - Why don't you hate me? -...a real law person in here - instead of some drunk woman. - Let go of my kid!
