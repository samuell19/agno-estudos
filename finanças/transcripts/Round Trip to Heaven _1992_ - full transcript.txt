That was ... How much? (dramatic music) - I got to call you back. What the hell? (sirens wailing) - Hold it right there, asshole. Hands up, behind your head, asshole, lock the fingers. - [Officer] Alright, on the hood, hands behind your back. Get him in the back. - Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here? - Police business, sir, everything's under control. Look, we're going to take him down and book him. - [Officer] Jim, I'll see you back at the station. - Hey, little girl, don't look so blue, Boingo has got a surprise for you. Watch the handkerchief. There you go. - Thanks. - Bye, little girl. Bye, kids. - [Children] Bye, Boingo! (honking) - Bye, kids. - You turkey. - Next time I show up at a party where the kids are one second older than preschool age, I'm out of there. - Well, one thing's for sure, Boingo is fun for the whole family. - That's funny. - Well, I should be so lucky, you know. - Oh, yeah, you've got a lot to complain about. Your dad sends you off to Europe to go to college and I'm stuck here slaving my ass off all summer with two jobs, not one, but two. - Come on, Larry, you know your dad would've done the same thing. - Yeah, I guess you're right. - [Steve] Boingo, I mean you got to admit, it's funny. I mean you do look pretty cute. - [Larry] We'll just see how funny it is, my friend, when you're standing in line to see the world premier of Boingo, the motion picture. - [Steven] Oh, yeah, I'm sure they're going to be lining up the block to see that one. - Lucille. - Hi. - Hey, what's going on? This is my cousin, Steven. - Hi, Steve. From New England, right? - That's right, hi. - Well, I guess maybe I'll see you guys later. - Yeah, maybe we'll come by for a slice, definitely. - She is cute. She one of your conquests? - Lucille? - Yeah. - No, she's like family. We go back for years. No sex involved. - Oh, pity. - I guess. - If you're coming to screw with me I'm going to bust your head open before you can say Pete Rose. - Mike, Mike, it's us, Larry and Steve, don't worry about it. - So, what, I'm here closing up. - Yeah, well that's kind of why I showed up now because I wanted to let you know. - And that's the last damn time, you can bet your ass on that. First there was only weekends. Then it was the film school every Monday night. How am I supposed to run a business here? - Like I was saying - - A while ago, the cops caught some clown out there in the yard. - A clown? - Probably trying to steal the Rolls if you ask me. Speaking of which, that Rolls is got to be finished first thing Monday morning. Which is two days after tomorrow, in case you're not counting. - Well, as a matter of fact, I'm going to be in here first thing tomorrow, so you really don't have anything to worry about. - I got news for you, pal. I'm out of here. - Okay. - I'm driving out of town for the weekend and I don't want any funny business here. And if the Rolls isn't finished Monday morning, look for a new job, that's a promise. - It's my kind of good day. - Just in time. So, I trust you're all packed. - I don't think I can do it, Uncle Jerry. - Oh come one, you just grab some things and you stuff them in a suitcase and you're all set. - I mean, I don't think I can go. - Uh, this has been a dream of yours for how long now? - I know, but maybe it was just meant to be that, a dream because reality is I'm going to be way out of my league. Like, way out. - Missy, if you're out of your league it's only because your head and shoulders above the rest of them. - Uncle Jerry, you know as well as I do - - What I know is, you got to follow your dreams. - So, you'll take off early tonight, you'll go home, you'll pack, you'll get a good night's rest. I got a cab coming nine o'clock tomorrow morning take you to the airport. (laughing) - That's gross. - Come on, you're gorgeous already, let's go. - Gorgeous, you want to see gorgeous, let me show you gorgeous. - Miss April Summer, now this my friend is gorgeous. - Oh yeah, the Miss Perfect you called and told me about once at two AM, my time. She's beautiful alright. I wouldn't do that, I mean if you keep sucking on that photo you're going to get ink poisoning and die. - I may put my mouth on her for real. I'd gladly die. - You die and I'll go get some pizza. (singing in foreign language) - You know the last time I saw a look like that was in your mother's eyes. God rest her soul. She was looking at your dad and the next thing you know there was a little pizza in the oven. - Uncle Jerry. - You better serve it to him before it gets cold. (upbeat music) Here you go. Nice to see people are enjoying my food. Listen, you got to promise, not a word of this to Lucille, she'd kill me. Open it up, look inside. They didn't put her picture in there, just some of the more well known models I guess, but she's in there. - Lucille Johnson. Sponsored by Uncle Jerry's Pizza Emporium. - Let me see. - I didn't know that Lucille was a model. - Oh yeah, she's been doing quite a little bit of it. On the side. Eye glasses, janitorial supplies, you know, local stuff. Last week she did a thing for the Turner Rose Association up in Bakersfield. - Really? - Yeah. - God, that's impressive. - Oh my God, I don't believe it, look at that. - Oh my God. - [Jerry] What is it, you know her? - Yes. Well, not yet. - Well, I just wanted to share it with you. I mean, hell, you've known her since junior high school. It's kind of nice when something like this happens to one of your own, huh? - Yeah, yeah, no that's great. No, I'm really happy for you. That's really great. - Would you like another pizza? - Hey, Jerry? - Yeah. - Wow, we just inhaled a pizza for 12. Hey, Larry, didn't you say those girls were going to cook us dinner tonight? - Ah, shit. (laughing) - Come on, you got to finish. - Yvonne, really, I can't have - - Yvette, silly, you keep calling me Yvonne, it's Yvette. - I knew that, I knew that actually. I was making sure you remembered - (laughing) Oh, thank you, thank you. So, you guys made it all yourselves, huh? - Yeah. We used up all the good shit in the house too. Heinz 57 sauce, ginseng and a couple cans of anchovies paste for the taste. - And you know what the ginseng is for. - That would be sex, right? - Mm hmm. - Yeah, well we should probably find out if that's working at all. Wait, I can feel it. It's happening, I can feel it. Let's go, I don't want to lose this. This is good. - Hey, is your friend going to stay in the bathroom all night? - Oh, well probably not. That would probably be a good thing if he didn't do that because if he was in the bathroom then he wouldn't be doing this ginseng thing or sex or. (knocking) Yo, Steve, it's time for desert and you should probably come get it yourself. (toilet flushing) (panting) - Are you okay? - Yeah, it must have been something I ate. Earlier. - [Tina] What flavor you like? (upbeat music) - Hey, wait a minute. We've got plenty of time, you know. - Okay, we got passion fruit, banana, a little lime thing going here. - You know, if it's any help, any one of those will do Muffy just fine. - Muffy?

So, of course, I took care of you and gave you some excitement. - Yeah, but in the last 24 hours I've ODed on pizza, I heaved all over some girl, we committed grand theft auto, some guy is chasing us around town with a gun, come on. - That's excitement, that is definitely excitement. Yo, let's try this one. See, what I'd tell you.

Come ahead, yes, thank you very much. - Anything else, sir? - [Larry] Nope, can't think of anything, thanks. - Fuck you, dick. - At last, some peace and quiet. - Now all we need to do is figure out a way to get into that reception tonight and get some tuxedos. - Hey, why don't we just break into the dry cleaning and steal a couple. - That's a great idea. - What, why do you always think I'm lying? What? No, I'm telling you, this white man jumped in my taxi and he put a gun to my damn head. What do you mean you going to put a gun to my head? Look. No, no, no, no, no, I am not with my ho.

Oh my God. - Come on, lady, I know Mr. Page has got to be staying here, his car's in the parking lot. - I'm sorry, sir, there's no one by that name registered at this hotel. Why don't you check in the restaurant. - Yeah. - Have a good evening, sir. - What's so good about it? - He was inquiring about a Mr. Page. Must be his exchange man. - We are closing in on him, Ed, I can feel it in my bones. - Speaking of a bone. Do you see those women going in and out of that ball room. - Maybe we should take this to the police. I think we should take this to the police. - No, no, Steve, we're not going to take this to the police. We're not going to spend the whole weekend in the police station answering questions. I mean, that's ridiculous. You know what. I bet you anything that the guy Lucille was talking about is after this money. - Oh, shit and he's got a gun. Larry, I don't like this, I don't like this at all. - What we're going to do, we're going to put this under the bed and we'll talk about it later. We've got things to do. (phone ringing) - Hello? Great. Hey, everybody, they're here, come on. Shh, turn off the light. Hide everyone, hide, quick. (chattering) - [Girls] Surprise! (cheering) - Thanks.

I got to get something to eat. - Not now, we're closing in on this turkey. Control yourself for Christ's sake. - Ed, that is easy for you to say. I mean you just take a couple hits of Maalox, you're fine for a couple hours, I am dying here. - I got it. What if we help Stoneface find Mr. Page? - How do you plan to do that? - You just keep an eye on him, I'll be right back. - [Melvin] Right. Waiter, no.

All I want to know is if you too any luggage up to Mr. Page's room? - Yeah, I took some luggage up to that cheap ass. Room 407, yeah 407. - Thank you. Just follow my lead. You believe our friend, Page. You remember Page? He used to play golf with us back in LA. The son of a bitch must have hit the lottery big time. Bought himself a brand new Rolls Royce convertible.
