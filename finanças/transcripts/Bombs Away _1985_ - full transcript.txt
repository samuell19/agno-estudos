Once upon a time, there was me, and I was bored. Bored to death of standing around doing nothing. So I decided to do something about it. Now, officially, I'm an AB-7439. But I hate that name. I prefer to be called M.A.R.Y. It stands for Military Armament, Round, Yellow. M-A-R-Y. M.A.R.Y. Oh! And if you're wondering, now, I'm a bomb. An atom bomb. What you call a big bomb. They can't expect me to be happy doing nothing forever. It's not fair. Whoa! All I'm looking for is a change. I want to get out, travel and see the world... while it's still there. ♪ It'd be so long to everyone ♪ ♪ If the government Lost the big one ♪ ♪ You better hope and pray You don't see the day ♪ ♪ The bomb gets In the wrong hands ♪ ♪ Someone might want To cause a fright ♪ ♪ And keep it in the city ♪ ♪ One slight cough Might set it off ♪ ♪ Oh, wouldn't that Be a blast? ♪ ♪ Bombs away ♪ ♪ Bombs away ♪ ♪ If they drop the big one Then you ♪ ♪ Better pray ♪ -Hurry!

Oh, damn! Oh, oh, shit! Oh, damn! Oh! -[man] Oh, my God! -Uh... We're in trouble. [Kable] And that's how my troubles began. One bored, pissed-off atom bomb aimed right at me. At the same time, I was under attack at home. Only Dad was using the word "dud." [indistinct chatter] I was supposed to go out in the world and find myself. I didn't even know I was missing. [indistinct chatter] -Could this be my chance? -[woman] Oh, those poor kids. -What's going on? -The kids are trapped. Great. It's okay, I'm a reporter. -[camera shutter clicking] -[crowd exclaiming] My babies! Ah! Come on, baby, don't do this to me. Help! Help! Help, I need some help. I'll give you some help. Ten more seconds, and then I shoot her. No, no, no! Don't shoot her! -You, come here. -[camera shutter clicking] Come on. You, come on. Just give me a kick right in there. Go on, help me. Now kick it. That's it. -[electricity crackling] -[indistinct shouting] [gasps] -[crowd exclaiming] -[woman] Hold on! Hold on! Oh, look at that. [Kable] For once in my life, I was a hero. Of course, there's no pleasing some people. Like Dad. Very nice, I guess. But why were you riding a Ferris wheel on a Monday? [Kable] You see what I mean? [Kable's father] Kable, you're just not working out. As a son, I mean. Ask anybody. Ask my secretary. Everything he says is true. Listen to him. It's your only chance. And if you don't believe her, ask anyone on the board of directors. He's right, Kable. [overlapping chatter] Tell me, how much have you contributed so far to the family fortune? Just as I thought. Exactly nothing. A big fat zero. Now, son, I'm a businessman. I know life isn't easy, but your general lack of, to be blunt, anything, is going to be the death of your poor, old granny. -Granny? -Look what you've done to me, you worm. You make me sick. Sick, sick! [Kable] Sorry. It's obvious to everyone, Kable. If you don't get out there and become somebody, I'm going to have to let you go. Be somebody, Kable. Believe me. Whatever the cost, it'll be worth it. [Kable] What could be worth this? A front-page hero one minute, strangled and kicked out of my own home the next. Then I get this phone call from the owner of Space Needle Cabs. A man who would do anything for publicity. [men] ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's A jolly good fellow... ♪ That was all for you. Knock it off. Look, the reason I called is I was wondering if, uh, if you had a job. We're looking for new drivers down here, and being the kind of a guy you are and all, you could help us a lot. I mean, PR stuff, you know. Give us a name, and make something of yourself of course, too. Why don't you come down and talk to us? [Kable] I'll show Dad... and Granny. "Hero saves children." Fine. It's gonna be just fine. Here's his uniform. No, we'll leave him the way he is. You're no regular cabbie, are you? You're special. We want you to look the part. Now, Kable, take a look at this. Magnificent, isn't it? It's the heart and soul of the city. And we keep track of it all right here. Not just the cabs, either. Anything that's important that's going on. Anything our cabs are doing out there, our little cabs are doing right here. [female dispatcher] That cab's on radio call. Oh, I'm sorry. [female dispatcher] Wrong way. Sorry. [female dispatcher] There's a three-alarm fire at 113rd Avenue. Oh, Johnny, do your fire engine. He's so good, he's embarrassed. Go ahead, Johnny. [mimicking siren] [Kable] I was just getting into my new job... when M.A.R.Y. the atom bomb came to town. She ended up at Lillian's War Surplus, run by a widow, Lillian Smithers, and her three kids. Strange people. Hey, look at this. What's an "AB-7439"? It's an atom bomb. [Kable] Well, they didn't panic. In fact, they decided to keep M.A.R.Y. to teach the Pentagon a lesson. Good luck. -[Kable coughing] -[man] Normally, you being a star and all, we'd give you the best cab in the fleet, but, uh, everyone seems to have gotten here first. So we're gonna have to do a little improvising. But I always say it's the man, not the vehicle. Now if you get hot, over $99, just mark it down over there, okay? And if there gets to be too much smoke, bang on the dashboard. Good luck, kid. Don't let me down! Hey! [Kable] As I drove off, I thought my troubles are finally over. My troubles were just getting warmed up. A couple of old friends of M.A.R.Y.'s from the Pentagon showed up. PR Ransom and Colonel Wild Bill Reynolds. The colonel was called Wild Bill because he always carried three or four guns at a time. He kept losing them. [indistinct chatter] [women cheering] [both grunting] [Susan] It says here that the central blast area of an AB-7439 is five miles across. It's at least five miles across. God, that means we have to go all the way to Everett. Why'd you take the flag down? Oh, my God! If they rush us, I run up here, -cut the rope, and blooey. -Are you crazy? No, but they don't know that. Psychological warfare. -Look out! -[metal clanking] Oh, no. [Susan] Easy. Easy. [female dispatcher] He's headed for the airport. [man] That's it. Kable. Go for the big one on the first fare. Gonna do great things. I hope so... for your sake. [engine rumbling] -[car horn honks] -[man] Move it, rookie. What the hell's he doing? Probably waiting for the big one. Trust me. He's got the touch. I can spot it anywhere. [female dispatcher] Car 47. Come in, Kable. This is the assistant dispatcher. We have your location at the airport. -We would like a status report. -[electricity crackling] Some touch. [man] Hey, rookie. He keeps moving back. I know. I know. I can see. What's going on? How about a cab? Convention. Only one left. It doesn't look safe. -[people chattering] -Look out. [man] Let's count it. Let's count it. Make sure we got it all. We had 17 bags when we left Texas. -[woman 1] Ten of them are yours. -[woman 2] That's not true. [man 1] Oh, it wasn't a bad flight. I didn't mind it. [man 2] Where are the cabs? [woman 1] I was counting all the bags. I don't know. -[man 1] Everybody got bags. -[man 2] Where are the cabs? [woman 2] Listen, where are the cabs? -[man 2] Taxi. -[woman 2] Taxi! Taxi! [woman 1] They're all gone. There's one. Follow me. [woman] Taxi! -Taxi. -Taxi! -Look out! -[woman] Faster! -[man 1] Taxi! -[woman] Look out! Out of my way! [man 1] Taxi! [woman] Taxi! Taxi! [man 2] Look out, lady. Taxi. [engine starts] [brakes screech] [man] Watch out! Watch out! [overlapping chatter] [man 1 coughing] Driver. [coughing] [man 2] Watch out. [coughing continues] [indistinct laughter and chatter] [man] Hey, we're here. [all cheering] [shouting excitedly] [Kable] I was thinking about giving all of this up, looking into the computer programming field. At the same time, Ransom and the colonel were looking for some help and I was about to be drafted. [shouting excitedly] [laughter] "Hero saves children"? [man] Come on, let's get out of here. [Ransom] He looks perfect. Cabbie, how would you like to work for the president of the United States? [Kable] What could I say? Okay, we've got our star player now. But remember, the quarterback can't win alone. It's the team backing him up that will put us over the top. Is that right? Now, let me hear it. [Johnny mimicking siren] Oh, never mind. [Ransom] Look at this file. "Lillian's War Surplus. Family-owned, classified as liberals and environmentalists." Interesting. Where's the building? Should be right down here. Check the address. This is the test order. Get rid of it. This is it. Around that corner. [Kable] Dad's gonna love this. The president. They seem a little strange. [Wild Bill] That's the building. [Ransom] It looks deserted. [Wild Bill] They're probably home sleeping. We'll be in and out before they come to work in the morning. It's awfully dark out there. Maybe we should get some help. [Ransom] We've got help. Right, cabbie? -[man] They're here. -[woman] I told you they'd send somebody. [Ransom] That's fine, cabbie. Don't look back. Don't talk. You sure this is it? Yeah, this is it. Up there. I see a light. Fourth floor. Put that away. Just leave your meter running. We'll settle up later. -It'll be a nice tip. -[clicking] What's that sound? The blinker. Turn it off, God damn it! Too far. Back the other way! [JJ] Right, left, right. [Max] Some kind of a signal. [JJ] Trap? -[Max] It could be. -[Lillian] I told you. Those tricky bastards Turn the light off. [JJ] Turn it on. Don't let 'em think we're afraid. [Susan] We should be afraid. We'd be perfect targets. Turn it off. [Ransom] Off. On? Off? Doesn't look good. It's some kind of signal. -A trap? -Could be. Tricky bastards. Kable? The cab looks empty now. We want this crate back, that's all. Nothing to worry about. If you run into somebody, tell them we'll take it back. No questions asked. They'll probably be glad to get rid of it. But no use telling them we're down here. Is there, Kable? [Wild Bill] If anyone should ask, tell them the crate's yours, right? [Ransom] You won't be sorry, Kable. This is no time to be reading. -Know your enemy. -Enemy's right out there. He's doing something. [Kable] Well, here goes nothing. Just a quick look. [man] He's getting out of the cab. [Susan] He looks like a real cab driver. -[man] It's a disguise. -Oh, I don't think so. He looks too nice. Looking nice is part of the disguise. He also looks sort of familiar. [Kable] I wish I'd gone ahead with those karate lessons. [cat meowing] You stay here. I'll go to the other side. All right. -[JJ over radio] I'll cover this side. -We're standing by. [Susan] Careful, he could be dangerous. -Think he's armed? -Maybe. He's probably trained in karate. -We're in position. -[JJ over radio] What's going on? I think he's coming. We think he's coming. Roger. I'm moving out. Quiet! [JJ over radio] Is he near yet? Hello? What's going on? He's over here. [cat meowing] -[clattering] -[thuds] Meow. Meow! [Max over radio] What's that meowing? Are you okay? All clear. [female dispatcher] He hasn't called in yet? His radio is probably out. Don't worry. I bet he's onto a big one. Maybe a sightseer. What's taking so long? It's a big building. Give me the gun. You see something? No, but if we go in, no guns. Unarmed? One bullet into that crate and poof! [Wild Bill] Doesn't seem right. But... I'm caught! My sleeve's caught. -[grunts] -[coat rips] Damn! My coat. I ripped my trench coat. [door creaks] -[Max] You looking for something? This? -[JJ] You know what this is? -[Susan] You do know, don't you? -[JJ] Where are they? -[Susan] Who are you? -[Max] He is a cab driver. Look. "Space Needle Cab Company." [Susan] Oh, Kable? What kind of name is that? [Max] Are you sure you're not with the Pentagon? [JJ] They're in the cab, aren't they? Tell them no deal. Can you remember that? [Susan] Hey, you're not going to try to run away, are you? Here's a list of our demands. You're telling we don't give up easy. Tell them we don't give up at all. [Max] Right. Not easy and not at all. [Susan] You look familiar. -Why, I... -Get going. [JJ] One to nothing. Hey, what's that pounding? [thumping] Jeez, Max, be professional. I knew they were in there. Turn the light on. Not yet. [Lillian] Does he know what's in the crate? -[Susan] I don't think so. -[Lillian] Doesn't surprise me. That's the way the government always works. Well, I suppose in a way, he's lucky not knowing. Well, they have to tell him now, won't they? Not a chance. They'll never tell him. -[man] Well, why should they? -[Susan] They've got no reason to. [man] I guess you're right. They won't tell him. [Lillian] I think they told him. [female dispatcher] Just staring isn't going to make it move. [Wild Bill] Damn civilians. Another one? It's loaded. Jeez, that's dangerous. -Blindfold him. -What? -With what? -Blindfold him. -What should I use? -Wait, I got an idea. [Ransom] You people are overdoing it. [Wild Bill] This is humiliating. I'm a colonel in the United States Army and you... [Ransom] Exactly what makes you so sure it's, uh... What did you call it? -AB-7438? -39. The packing slip says so. -[Wild Bill] Could be in code. -It's not a code. [Wild Bill] Have you looked inside? It's a bomb, all right. An atom bomb. Military Armament, Round, Yellow. -M-A-R-Y. -[Susan] Pre-1955 model. Practically an antique. Maximum yield, eight megatons. -Maximum blast area... -Better than five miles! He was in the Air Force. [Ransom] All right, all right. It's a bomb. -[Susan] An atom bomb. -[man] And you want it back. -[Wild Bill] Damn right! -[Susan] Fine. [Ransom] Excellent. I knew we could work this out. [Susan] Just as soon as you meet our demands. Oh, yes, uh... The, uh, demands. Um... How am I supposed to read this? "The president of the United States of America must appear on national television. Two, he must explain to the nation how this happened. Three, he must promise that this will never happen again. Four, he must punish those responsible. Five, he must personally ask us to return the bomb." -Uh, about the president... -[man] I thought he loved going on TV. Well, of course he does, but we don't want to panic. Panic could be dangerous. You haven't been to the papers, TV stations? -Not yet. -Mm-hmm. [Susan] What are you doing? -Doing you a favor. -[Lillian] We've got copies. Lots of them. I said I was doing you a favor. I'm destroying the evidence. -What evidence? -[Ransom] The evidence against you. I assume you knew it was a federal offense to have or retain any nuclear device for more than 24 hours without written permission from the president of the United States. [Wild Bill] Section 3338-59, US Criminal Code. Section 3338-59... 60. -Even the old ones? -Especially old ones. Punishable by up to five years in prison. Five years? Oh, Mother, I told you. Five years? Come on. We don't make the laws. [Lillian] You sent us the bomb. That's not illegal. That was a mistake. You made another mistake. You left your back window down. Rain. Is it raining? Worse than that. [Wild Bill] My God, you've ruined it! -[man] Why did you tell him? -[Wild Bill] We needed a ride. -[man] How much does he know? -[Ransom] Too much. We can't let him get to the newspapers. [man] We've got to stop him. We've got to shut him up. [Wild Bill] If he talks, we're all in trouble. [Kable] Wait a minute. How far can I get? If I went back, I could be a hero again. Help save the city. There he is. Somebody might see us. Act casual. Smile. Hey, Kable, we want to talk to you. Hey, wait a minute! We won't hurt you. [Kable] Go away. [Ransom] Don't worry, Kable. We're working this out. [Wild Bill] This is nothing but a security precaution. -[Susan] Can you breathe? -[Wild Bill] Of course he can. Why didn't the others help us? -Who? -[Wild Bill] All the others when we came up. -Oh, uh, they... -They went home. Yeah, it was getting late. [men singing] Muzak? Oh, my God. I forgot Uncle Ken was practicing here. -Hi, everybody. -Hi, Uncle Ken. -Ah... -Be quiet. [Uncle Ken] Just getting in a little practice. We're singing at the convention, you know. Singing at the convention? Great. We'll try and be there. I hope so. ♪ For it was... ♪ [man] See you later, Ken. Sounds good. -Who was that? -Uncle Ken. -He works for us. -[Wild Bill] He knows? -Not really. -Uncle Ken is too high strung for this. Uncle Ken has a problem. You frighten him and... He's got a weak bladder. That's disgusting. Nobody's perfect. Right, Kable? [Kable] Help. [breathing heavily] [man] What are we gonna do with him? [Wild Bill] I can think of one thing. [Susan] We could make him neutral, like the Swiss. -He's an American. -He's already neutral. No, he isn't. He came with us. You tied him up. Temporary strategy. He knows too much. Unfortunately, that's true. Stop that breathing. We can't hear ourselves think. [heavy breathing stops] So, we have to shut him up. Oh, he won't say anything, will you? -How do you know? -Look at his face. -[Ransom] That a promise? -[Wild Bill] Cross your heart. -[Susan] Not a word, right? -[Lillian] No, an oath of silence. Pledge him to secrecy. No talking to anybody outside this room. Pledge to silence. -No talking. -Period. -What. -Period. No talking at all. Period. [thuds] [typewriter clacking] [sighs] It might seem strange, not talking at first. But it's not like they want your opinion. "Hereby pledge not to utter a single word..." "To any living soul until..." Okay by me. Twenty-four hours. I'll call the White House tonight. Naturally, he makes the final decisions for this sort of thing, but I'll do my best. Remember whose side you're on, Kable. Nobody's. [Kable] Nobody's side? What about my side? I guess I'm on the side of whoever ends up with the bomb. All that stopping and starting. Think there's something wrong with our computer? [female dispatcher] No, I don't think that's the problem. That was a ticklish situation, Kable. They were in an ugly mood. If you want to talk a bit, just to us, that's okay. I could tear this pledge up. How do people like that get in the war surplus business? Her husband was a war hero. Yeah? On whose side? [Lillian] Now they know we're not kidding. [man] I don't think we should have let that cabbie go with him. [Lillian] Don't worry about him. He's one of us. Well, I don't trust any of them. If you ask me, we should be ready for a sneak attack. What's that for? Don't worry, it's a dummy. Psychological warfare. Shit. As for those demands, in a perfect world, I'd support them one hundred percent. But really... The president on TV, explanations, apologies. We could have a panic. I know what you're saying, Kable. What's worse, a panic or a nuclear explosion, right? That's what you're saying? Well, a panic could cause a nuclear explosion. What he means is... some of these devices are kind of... unstable. People find out they're near one, they start running around, screaming, and poof. You know what I mean? [Wild Bill] We've got some secret reports you wouldn't believe. Now, I'm not saying that it will happen, just that it might. Sometimes these things seem almost human. And you know what being human means. It means you can't trust it. That's what it means. [Susan] M.A.R.Y., I was wondering if, uh... Hi. [Susan] If you were feeling any hostility towards us for the way that we've been treating you. She's talking to it. Yeah, it's a technique they taught us in the Air Force. -If it makes you nervous, you talk to it. -No kidding. And, you know, we didn't invite you here. It's only until Mother talks to the president of the United States. Now you know who that is, don't you? And then you can go home. Max! This isn't doing any good. That never worked for me either. [man] I hope not. Listen, I got a feeling those government guys are gonna try something funny. We should be prepared. Well, what if somebody infiltrates them? -Like who? -Well... Me. Yeah. Swell. We should schedule guard duty. You're right. They're not supposed to talk back, are they? I don't know. Those things are weird. That's not funny. Talking bombs. That's not funny! Look at that. He keeps that meter running, it could be a record. Shouldn't we try to get in touch with him? [man] What? You want to jinx him? You don't mention a no-hitter until the game is over. [female dispatcher] I guess not. There you go. Trust me. [meter clicks] [Ransom] Let it run. You're working for the United States government now. Good idea. Practice not talking so you don't make a slip-up. Let them think you're neutral. Don't worry, Kable. We know whose side you're on. -Who's that? -[woman] Kable! Yoo-hoo! -[Wild Bill] Looks like a reporter. -[Ransom] Damn! Publicity is the last thing we need. Hi, Kable. Remember me? At the Ferris wheel? [camera shutter clicking] -[Ransom] She didn't see us. -I wanna do a story. Kable? Kable! [Wild Bill] Yeah, but now what? -Here she comes. -Kable... Remember me? Jane Clark. I want to do a follow-up. You know, you on the job, picking up interesting people. -[softly] Get down. -How it feels to be a brand-new hero. Stay there, smile for the camera. -That's a nice... -[softly] Good going, Kable. Keep distracting her. -I think this could be on television... -And then get out of here -and keep your mouth shut. -That's really what I want to be, is a television reporter. [continues indistinctly] Just, that's it. That's it. Come on. Come on. Kable. Nice for the camera. Nice. Perfect. Come on. Come on... [shrieks] [Wild Bill shouts] -Don't you dare... -[Wild Bill] You're stepping on my hand. Let's go. [Jane] You people got in my way... Heh. Let's go. I knew I'd seen you before. Why didn't you tell me you're a hero? That's right. Keep silent. They'll never suspect. But we know whose side you're on, don't we? No, don't say a word. [Ransom] Please stop that. [Kable] Things are looking up. [engine starts] -[indistinct chatter] -[Wild Bill coughing] [Jane] I here on official business... They're trying to steal our star. Oh, good. He turned them down. [Kable] Wouldn't you know it? I try to have fun and Ransom runs off and calls the Texas lieutenants. [man] Sex? Now? -[woman] Don't you like me? -You're kidding. Come on. Don't be a stick in the mud. Please stop that! -This is not the time or the... -[woman] Nobody can see us. [man] Wait, that's them! -[woman] Isn't this exciting? -[phone ringing] [man] Hurry! Get it. [woman] They can't... [man] Get it. Quick! Get it. Get it! -[ringing stops] -Oh, damn. Try the other one. We're in trouble. -There it is. Get it! -Quick. Get it. I'll get it. Lieuten... Lieutenant Smith here. Get out here right away. We found it. -Oh, great. -Thank God. But does it look okay? [Ransom] Don't celebrate yet. There's a problem. I knew it. -Will it go off if it's dropped? -Dropped? -Yes, dropped. Will she go off? -Of course it will. Dropping's the whole point, isn't it? I mean, dropped from, say, ceiling height. [Smith] To the floor? That's right, dropped from the ceiling to the floor. Will she go off? Well, our planes usually fly higher than that. -We could look in the manual. -Look in the manual. Nice idea. I like that. Very professional. -Good. Do that. -[Smith] Right, sir. What next? Uncle Ken. He's their weak link. [Kable] Even heroes need to relax. What can I do? They're my family. Do you think we're doing the right thing with M.A.R.Y.? What do you think, MAR? Yeah, that's just what Kable said. Silence is kind of sexy, isn't it? -[hiccups] -[laughing] [Susan laughing] M.A.R.Y.? M.A.R.Y., is that you? How long has it been since this car has been serviced? -About two years. -[whistles] Maybe that's what's wrong. I can't believe he'd cross me. You're too trusting. Being famous changes people. [birds chirping] [man speaking indistinctly] -[knocking on door] -[Ransom] Who's it? Who is it? Kable. Is that you? Great timing, Kable. Uh, I've just spoken with the president. He wants M.A.R.Y. checked out right away. So he sent us some experts. [Kable] Experts, my ass. Can you believe those disguises? Government issue. Oh, don't worry about it. They're on an expense account. Sure is nice of you helping us out, cabbie. How does it feel not talking? Right. Interesting idea. Hope these people aren't too weird, considering. Never hurts to be prepared. I'm not sure we should have told him. He hasn't been out of the bathroom since. He can't get off this boat until we do. And right now we need some inside help. -Feeling better? -Sort of. Quite a story. No wonder everybody's been acting so strange. Excuse me. This is our inside help. He's got to stop sometime. I don't know. They say the body is 90% water. Don't worry. I've got a plan. -[exhales] -False alarm? -Mm. -This has been quite a shock. I mean, I'm in the war surplus business and all, but usually we just sell bayonets, stocking caps. It's always a little shocking at first. Most people calm down. Well, I've made up my mind. -Lillian is acting irrational. -My words exactly. -So we've got to do something. -Precisely what I had in mind. -Excuse me. -Shit. Not necessarily. [horn blares musically] How do we know they're expert? [JJ] Grab that. -[Max] Okay. -[JJ] Be careful. -What's the matter? -In the Air Force, what'd they say about talking to one of these things? They said it might make you feel better. They put some sort of recorder in 'em to make it talk? I don't think so. -All right. That's it. -What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Stand over here. I've changed my mind. You're not getting near it. Test, one, two, three. Max, did you hear me? Hello. Test, one, two, three. I hear you loud and clear. We brought the instruction manual. And Max is gonna check it out. -Who's Max? -Our expert. Tell Max to go ahead. -Go ahead, Max. -Roger. I'm going ahead. [man] Roger. You're going ahead. I'm now taking out the nails. [man] You're now taking out the nails. Now taking out the nails. He's now taking out the nails. [creaking] -One. -[man] One... [creaking] -Two. -[man] Two. -Three. -[man] Three. -[exhales] -Four? Four. Four? [Max] I'm now opening the lid. He's now opening the lid. You're now opening the lid. [creaking] [man] How's it look, Max? Can you see it? Max? I can hear him breathing. He's not moving. Max. Come in, Max. -I was afraid of this. -He's fainted. [man] Speak to me, Max! This is pretty exciting, isn't it? -Yeah. -They don't seem so bad. I think we can reason with them. Yeah. -What are you doing? -[grunts] -Not now. -[groans] -They could come back any second. -[moans] The cab. Go on in. -[man] There he is. -[Susan] He's alive. -Speak to me, Max. -Max! Get up, Max. Are his eyes open? [Susan] It didn't kill him. Thank God. [Lillian] He fainted from the strain. That's it. I knew it. -[softly] I didn't faint. -He's alive. [man] It's a miracle. What did you say? -I said I didn't faint. I gave up... -[man] Right. He said, "I didn't faint, I gave up." -[Lillian] Gave up? -What's that mean? [Max] It'll go off. I know it will. [man] He's kidding. [moans and grunts] [car squeaking] Reminds me of my younger days. -Aah! -Oh. -[woman moaning] -Wait. -Hmm? -[softly] Wait. If it goes off now? What? -[Smith] I mean, while we're down here doing this... -What? What if... How's it gonna look? -[Susan over radio] Try moving. -[Max over radio] I can't. It'll go off. I know it will. "I can't. It'll go off." Now don't worry, it's just the attack talking. Who's worried? Funny he never told us about these. Come on. He'll be all right in a few minutes. [creaking] [Kable] One thing about M.A.R.Y., life around her wasn't boring. [woman] God! Yeah! [Smith grunts] [squeaking] I guess that's it. -Oh, gee. Oh, my God. -Come on, let's go. What's the matter? Come on, cabbie, let's go. [engine starts] They're waiting for us, so let's get out of here. Kable, we can't find Uncle Ken. JJ thinks Ransom and the colonel have him. We're talking about kidnapping, Kable. You know what that means, don't you? Do they have him, Kable? Can you tell us? No? "No, you can't tell us" or "No, they don't have him"? All right, look, can you tell us if they have him? -Okay, you can. -[Smith] Cabbie, let's go. Do they have Uncle Ken? No, they don't? -God, what a way to communicate! -Come on. We're ready to go. Action speaks louder than words! [sighs] -[Smith] Well, that wasn't so bad. -No. [Smith] Do you think the colonel will be able to get the troops? [woman] Of course he will. He is a colonel. They've got a squad of Rangers. No, no, Rangers might recognize you know what. Get some, uh, basic trainees, that's it. Got any recruits? Second or third week of basic? I don't care if they can march or not. Jeeps? A tank? No, we'll get something less conspicuous. Uh, never mind. Yes, have them bring their rifles. -But no ammunition. -And no ammunition. Come to think of it, have them bring drill rifles instead. [Wild Bill] Drill rifles instead. And tell them to wear civilian clothes. Thank you. [woman] We'll be late. Come on. [indistinct chatter] -[man 1] You gotta move over. -[man 2] Can we all fit in here? -[woman] I don't know, but... -Why are you avoiding me? -Something going on here. -[man] Come on, buddy. Who are those guys you're always with? [man] Come on, driver, step on it. Did we get them tickets? I'm getting butterflies. [overlapping chatter] What's the matter? Don't you want our business? [man] Come on, hurry up! Hurry up! Let's go. Tip-top shape. Absolutely. -Then we can go ahead. -Good. [knocking on door] Who is it? -[knocking] -Who is it? Kable. You're still here. Look, Kable, uh, we're on the phone again talking to the president. You come back later, okay? He's gone. -You can come out now. Make yourself at home. -[toilet flushing] -So? -[woman] It looks good. [Smith] We checked out the bomb very, very carefully. [Wild Bill] Good. Now, one thing... this is my family. No physical violence. [Ransom] We're not talking about violence. Strategy, man. Stealth and strategy. Right. They'll never expect good old Uncle Ken to be helping us. We'll be in and out before they know what hit them. -[Uncle Ken] Hit them? -Figure of speech. Come on. We've got a date. [Kable] Looks like the old double-cross, doesn't it? It doesn't seem fair, but I guess you can't expect nuclear war to be fair. [engine starts] Mr. Ransom. Mr. Ransom, I'd like to talk with you. I'm from the Times, and I know you have some relationship with-- [clears throat] Wrong person. I don't have relationships with anybody. But I have reason to believe-- You've got no reason, period. Buzz off. What's going on? And what about that cab driver, Kable? [Wild Bill] It's freezing back here. [Smith] The freezer switch is broken. [Wild Bill] I should have worn my uniform. Call us on this when you locate the crate. We'll do the rest. [over radio] Stand by... All right, men, check your gear. Don't be nervous. Our objective... A large crate of government property. Six feet long, this wide and this high. It has the letters Capital M, Capital A, Capital R, Capital Y on the side. -Jeez, that's my mother's name. -[Wild Bill] We'll bring it down. You load it carefully back on this truck. And we'll have you back by evening chow. Any questions, men? About these guns... Rifles, sir, they're not real. Psychological warfare. Shouldn't I tell them I'm coming? Good idea. Pull over. [over radio] Hang on. Anybody got change? -[coin rattles] -[phone rings] [line rings] [phone ringing] -Hello. -Hello, JJ. This is Uncle Ken. Listen, I know all about it and I want to help. -Uncle Ken? -We're in a difficult situation. What are you talking about? We're gonna be okay. The cab driver explained it all. So I'll be right over. I talked to JJ. I told him I wanted to help. Good. Did he ask any questions? -No. -Let's go. -As soon as you get inside-- -Oh, my God, stop! [all groaning] Jeez. Fingerprints. -What? -I left my fingerprints on the phone. [Smith] Don't worry about it. I won't do it unless I wipe them off. -[woman] Oh, my God. -All right, back up. Anybody got a handkerchief? -[Smith] Hold on. -[Ransom] Look out! [all groaning] [Wild Bill] What happened? Excuse me. I said, what happened? [automated voice] Please hang up and try your call again. This is a recording. Satisfied? [Kable] That's all we need. Trouble with the phone company. Look at him go. Looks like an emergency run. A pregnant mother, maybe, with the delivery on the way. He's back in that building again. Again? I'll give him one more chance. Oh, thank God you're here. Uncle Ken called. Is there going to be trouble? JJ thinks there is. [Ransom] Standby. We're stopping. Standby, men. Five minutes. If we don't hear from you, we're coming in. -[Wild Bill] Roger that. -Thanks. [Wild Bill] All right, men, check your rifles. Remember, you're a team now. [Ransom over radio] All right, Ken, this is Ransom. So far, so good. No sign of trouble. Looks like we caught them with their pants down. Oh, sorry, Ken. [Uncle Ken] Oh, my God, JJ. [JJ] Uncle Ken, what are you doing here? What's this about the cabbie talking? I'm fine. Nice to be back. -Hey! -Just gonna run downstairs. You don't need to be afraid of me. -I'm fine. -What's the matter? Just be a minute. I'm fine. Uncle Ken, are you in trouble? [Uncle Ken] Nothing's going on. I came back to... To work. [toilet flushes] Uncle Ken? Open that door! I knew it. -[JJ] Uncle Ken's betrayed us. -[Max] Fantastic. [Susan] Got it. [JJ] I think he's on the other side. Hold it, Kable. [Max] Easy now. Be careful now. [Susan breathes heavily] -Easy. Watch it. -[Susan] Watch it! [JJ] We'll beat 'em yet. [Max] I'll go down to swing it in. Ken? Ken? Ken! Come in, Ken. -Can we come out now? -Yes. [men shouting] Come on! Come on! Come on! They're a disaster. About face! Keep your eyes open, look sharp. [creaking] [Susan] Good. Watch it. Come in, Ken. Ken? Ken? I hear water running. What's this? A barricade? You're kidding. What the hell? Pathetic. [Smith] That was easy. These are beginners. We're getting them now. [laughs] Let's go. Move it! We've got 'em now. -One, two... -[Smith] Oh, my God! [JJ] Three, four... [Wild Bill] Hit the deck! [Ransom] Oh, my God, I'm a civilian. Here. -It's a dummy. -Oh, no! Ow! Uh-oh. Attention. Looks filthy, soldier. [creaking] [Susan] No. Not now, Max. -Fight it, Max! -I can't help it. I have no control. Oh, no. Fight it, Max. Fight it! [gasping] Look... Kable! Hit the deck! [creaking] Kable, you did it. You saved the city. Wake up, Kable. [JJ] All right, on your feet. Let's go. We got work to do. Looks sharp, man. [whistles] [Wild Bill] Stop! What are you doing? That's M.A.R.Y.! -He's not on our side, you idiots! -Get him. It's too late. That's good. Move out. Come on, gotta go. -Bye. -Take care. -[soldier 1] Good luck. -[soldier 2] Attention! Well, at least we got some prisoners. [toilet flushing over radio] Kable? What have they done to you? I hope you're satisfied. What was he doing here? He's helping us. You'd say anything to confuse us. Something funny's going on around here. And I'm going to find out what it is. Good. Don't worry, Kable. We know you're 100% with us. This is only a precaution. [Kable] While I'm being heroic and self-sacrificing, they're running around, playing Let's Make a Deal. I'll call. [ringing] -[Ransom] Hello. -[Lillian] Ransom? -This is Lillian. -Good to hear from you. -I bet you have a deal for us. -This is important. -Is the colonel there too? -He's listening. Good. Now this is the deal. Swap the bomb for Susan and Max. -Don't forget Uncle Ken. -Ah! All right. And Ken. Any tricks, we go straight to a TV station. Understand, Ransom? -No problem. -We'll meet at the parking garage at the center. Ken knows where it is. -You think she went for it? -No doubt about it. It wasn't our fault, all of this. They sent you here, so we can't back out now. Right? Don't worry, we got a plan. [dispatcher over radio] Testing. One, two, one, two. Get that worm. [thuds] [Susan] What's that sound? Is somebody here? Somebody to help us? [Max] It's probably a trick. Don't say a word. [camera shutter clicking] [Susan] Oh, a broad. -[Max] Right. -Looks like you're in trouble. [Susan] Oh, the whole city is in... Shh! They'll hear you! One at a time. -Untie us. -No! -Why not? You're not on their side, are you? -No. Well, you... You can't leave us here. They... They've got her. They need help. And you've got... Who are you? -A reporter covering this story. -What kind of reporter? Well, right now, I just work for the newspaper, -but I'm open to... -[Max] Listen, there's something about M.A.R.Y. -I don't remember... -M.A.R.Y.? Is she the boss? No, you don't understand. They're gonna swap us. What channel are you on? No, I don't work for TV now. But I'm hoping when this story breaks... Listen, what are they swapping you for? Defense plans? [Uncle Ken] I didn't know it was gonna be like this when I said I'd help. -I don't want to be traded-- -Shh! Shh! You! Don't try anything tricky. Been suspicious of you for a long time. You were too good to be true. Now we're gonna go find M.A.R.Y. Ready? [elevator whirring] Welcome back. [Susan] You'll never get away with this. [Uncle Ken] I have to go to the bathroom. [Kable] Everybody's got a plan. Mine was to get loose and to get M.A.R.Y. And to then... I understand it all now. You weren't really a hero. That was all part of the plot. I put you on the front page, but it was a trick. A signal. This time I'm gonna use you. "Crusading new TV reporter breaks up spy ring." Don't worry. When I get you on TV, you'll talk. They always do. Look, that's what I need. A TV crew. [crowd shouting] Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! I've got a story... See him? He's getting away. The story... We've got to... He's paying for that door. We're talking about national security here. Hurry, he's getting away! [all shouting] [man] What time are we gonna be on? [woman] What channel are we gonna be on? [engine rumbling] -Now where the hell's he going? -I can't tell yet. I'm gonna tell the boss about this. Attention. We've tracked him to the center parking garage. [Lillian] We've got you covered. No tricks. Please stop this. [JJ] We've got you covered. [woman] And I thought I could trust you. We are very, very disappointed. [JJ] Disappointed? I thought we could trust you. Right. You can hand everything over. That'll be the day. [man] We've got you covered. [Lillian] There's a principle here. [man] Right. Just who tells who. -[Lillian] Big deal. -[Ransom] Big deal? Big deal? Are you kidding? Damn right. It's a big deal. You people will never learn. [Susan] Please stop this. You're taking an awful chance pulling guns around this thing. -So are you. -[Susan] Here's Kable. We know what we're doing. -[Susan] Help us, Kable. -This changes things. It certainly does. Put your guns down slow. [Lillian] Not a chance. Kable's on our side. Tell 'em, Kable. Sorry, he's been with us from the beginning. -Tell them, Kable. -Come on, Kable. [Wild Bill] Speak up! What do you want? [Susan] He wants all of you to put your guns down. If I were you, Kable, I'd be asking myself, is this the way a public-spirited citizen should act? We can't throw our guns down, Kable. You don't expect the four of us to do that, do you, Kable? [Lillian] Oh, my God, he'll blow us all up. [Kable] I'll be damned. It worked. Five hundred... and forty-six dollars and 20 cents. That's a new record. I'm happy to announce we have a new record, $546.20. [cheers and applause] Get back to work. We still have got problems here. I have them in sight. They're arguing about some kind of a crate. [Kable] Damn, I was doing so well on my own. $546.20. I guess we can buy a new door for that, huh? I know this was too good to be true. They trying to stiff you, Kable? Here. Let me have that. All right, who's been using that cab? [all] They have! Well, somebody's got a hell of a bill to pay here. And nobody's leaving till it's settled. You've got to be careful who you pick up. You know, I'm not always going to be around to help you collect. No credit cards. How about one from the United States government? [man] Are you kidding? [helicopter hovering] [Smith] Looks like they've got trouble. Who's that other guy? -My God! They've got guns. -[Smith] This wasn't supposed to happen. [both] Get down. Get down! Quick! This is our chance. Get in. [JJ] What? Oh, yeah, right. Come on, Max. -I'm coming. -[Lillian] Hold on. [Susan] Kable, look out! -Kable! -Stop, thief! Come back with that! -I'll stop 'em. -No! We could be walking into a trap. I'll bet you those troops are waiting downstairs. Pull over down here. -[Lillian] Careful. -[JJ] Right. Be careful. Oh, Kable. Not again, Kable. What are you doing? You want to set it off? It's not loaded! Come on. Friends of yours? How about if we settle for half the bill? Twenty-five percent? To cover the cost of expenses? -It's empty. -Get another one. Here's yours. -Forget it. It's empty. -[Wild Bill] What? I didn't want to be the one to set the bomb off. Get yours. [Wild Bill] Mine's empty. Why should I be the one? They're all empty. Here, give me that. Forget it. -We've got to get them. -They're empty. They don't know that. How about 10% and a nice tip for Kable? Do you have one of our cards? [JJ] Max, be careful. [Lillian] I'll meet you on the other side. [tires screeching] Hurry. Hurry! [Wild Bill] Stop in the name of the president of United States! I told you they're useless. It's better than nothing. Easy. I'll get it. [Max] Careful. It's going too fast. I'm losing it. -[JJ] I'm trying. I can't hold it. -Watch it! God, I thought... Never mind. Let's go. Hurry! Here they come! Get off, God damn it! There. [Smith] Who's that? Looks like a reporter. [Smith] Oh, no, not TV! The last thing we need is publicity. Some people have nothing to fear from publicity. Right now, I can't think of anything more dangerous than publicity. What about M.A.R.Y.? Well, one thing. Kable, you missed all the excitement. Come on, let's go get 'em. I think we can still collect our money. [helicopter hovering] [Smith shouting] I forgot the gun! Oh, don't worry about it! It's not loaded! I'm gonna go get your cab. Okay. Well, you should have seen it. JJ and Mom took off with M.A.R.Y., and they were shooting at it, and then... Then they jumped him and... [camera shutter clicking] Come on. You ready? It's close. [Ransom] Stop, stop! Oh, damn! [Ransom] Want to play games, kiddies? We'll play games. [panting] I can't go much further. My old war wounds are acting up. Come in, John One. Come in, John One. We have M.A.R.Y. Get set for pickup. [woman over radio] We cannot land! You must find someplace to hide it. Hide it? We need to capture some high ground. [both] Ninety-five, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Actually, this is fun. You know, five big ones is... Is definitely worth it. What about me? Does he owe you money, Kable? I'm sorry. I'm on call. Call our main office. Hurry. We'll do him and then we'll follow the others. Hi. Remember me? Jane Clark. Covering the spy story. Quick. Use the radio. -Warn him about the water. -Do not get it wet. Tell him to hide it. It's okay. Kable. It happens to the best of us. I'll tell you one thing, though. The rest of this is going on their tab too. Now where would you go if you wanted to go someplace where a taxi couldn't find you? Psst. -What happened? -They took it, with guns. Here. But they're not loaded. Neither are theirs. -Don't tell 'em I told you. -[both] Thanks, Ken. [man] All right, stay here. I know you've had a tough day. I'll go up and look around. And if I flush 'em out, you... Bang! Right? -[man 1] Whoa, there, boys! -[Ransom] Look out. Hi. Having fun? You going up there? Yeah. They say the view is great. [man 1] You boys look all tuckered out with that. [man 2] You sure do. -[man 3] You want some help? -[man 2] Bet you do. -That'd be great. -[man 1] Say no more. -Say no more. -We'll take it right on up.

I know those guns aren't loaded. [woman over PA] Welcome to the Space Needle. We're traveling at 800 feet per minute. The needle is 605 feet high and it commands a 360-degree view of Seattle and the surrounding area. [Kable] If I could just get my hands on M.A.R.Y.
