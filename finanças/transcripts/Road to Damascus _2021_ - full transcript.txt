Hey. Thanks. Yeah. I can't keep working half-shifts like this, Shelly. You need to help me jump my car again. I gotta start working more hours. Tomorrow. Then I'm gonna need the car again tonight. I picked up a shift from Tommy. Okay. What time? 11:30. Fine. Do you have this month's rent? Hey, Shell. Hey, what's up? What's up? What's going on? You know... Yeah, I know what you mean. Super lame over here too. Do you think you could take those books back to the uni for me? They've been really riding my ass. Yeah, I mean... I could, or... we could go together. Uh... I don't... I don't think so. Yeah, why don't we go together? I'll help you register. You know you can still come back. I just... No, I... It'd be weird, I just... It's not, though. It's really not. It'll be fine. Look, are you... are you gonna do it for me or not? Yeah, whatever. Hey, um, is Thomas around? No, he's at the store. He's on this really annoying homemade-everything kick. I don't know. Oh, he just got in. A little help would be great. - What? - It's Shelly. All right, I got some more down in the car, will you go grab it? Clean your fucking nose off. Shelly, hey, how's it goin'? Oh... You know, it's tough. Yeah? Real dog-eat-dog out there. What can I do for you? You think... just maybe, um... I've just... I got expenses everywhere, I've got no fucking cash. - Shelly. - Rebecca's hounding me... Shelly, Shelly, Shelly, I got you, I got you. Great. Oh my God, Thomas, thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no worries, that's fine, it's just, uh, you know, remember our deal, all right? Could you maybe come by my work late today? I'll find some time, I'll come through and I'll give you a bag, all right, to tide you over till later. Thanks, thanks again, Thomas. All right, yup, see ya when I see ya. Jesus Christ, do you think you got enough? Stockin' up, baby. I see that. Wait, did you hang up? - Yeah. - I wasn't done talking to her. She was done talking to you. Wow, Thomas, you just really don't care about anybody, do you? Rebecca... all right, you know what, you wanna know what I'm doing here? - Huh? - Yeah, I do. I'm trying to go to her house so I can speak to her about this whole, you know, college thing, speak her language, see if I can get a fire under her belly, you know? Look... I get it, all right, she's depressed and lonely, and she's your friend, and if you want me to play the supportive boyfriend role, then that's what I'm gonna do for you. It's not just that. - There's... - What is it? I don't know, there's more to it! You can't just push Shelly. She's... she's fragile. She's not just depressed or whatever. And I was already talking to her about it... Rebecca, Rebecca, it was her idea! All right? What do you want me to do about it, huh? Really, what do you want me to do? I don't know! Look... I think Shelly is frustrated with the way that you nag her about this shit all the time. I mean, think about it, Jesus Christ, I would be. All you do is you make her feel guilty about this shit, and I know that you know you're doing that, so... you know, if someone's being selfish here, it's you. - Fuck you, Thomas. - Yeah, all right, let's react about it. Let's react about it. Chop up some lines, let's do coke all day. That sounds tight. Car trouble? Yeah. I can maybe give you a jump. You try that yet? I, uh... I don't know. Well, why don't we give it a shot? - What's up, Shelly? - Thomas! How we doin'? Hate my life, wanna die. - So you still need help. - Yeah. You see that? I don't give a fuck, I'm not the boss. All right, so we can do it right here? - Yeah. - All right. Till next time. - Thanks, Thomas. - Yup. Thanks, Grover, I... don't know how I let it sit here for so long. That's all right. But, uh, I'm gonna need that rent, Francis. Come on, man, I thought we were having a moment here. Rules are rules, man. Look, I... I've got your money. I... I just need to take care of a couple things first. Shelly... Shelly hasn't been a lot of help. No shit! Never got why you live with a queer. All right, Grover, thanks. Sure, Francis. I'll be seein' you about that rent, man. Greedy motherfucker. Hey, Sam. Yeah, no, I'm coming. - Hey. - Hey! Wanna go to the bar later? - Definitely! - Cool. Hey, Shelly, um... I just want to let you know that I got my car back up and running, so I'm not gonna need the truck later. Are you okay? Yeah, no, I'm... I'm fine. I'm just outta the house. Okay, so, you don't need the truck? No, it's fine. You sure you're all right? Look, Shelly, I gotta go. - Fucking bitch. - No, no, no. Would you shut the fuck up for one second? - You are so self-righteous. - ...yapping at me since you got here, shut the fuck up for a second. No, I know what your fucking president thinks of me - and women and Black people. - You fucking snowflake. You are so self-righteous! Shut the fuck up, you fucking bitch. You've been fucking going at me since you got me. Shut the fuck up, you fucking... Bye, Hillary. Oh, now you're just gonna fucking run away? Fucking Nazi scum. Urge to smack you upside your fucking head. Jerk. Oh, hey. Fuck off, fuck off, fuck off. Fuck off! Hi, Shell. Glad you finally showed up. See that asshole I scared off? Hey, let me get you something. Could I have another gin and tonic and something for my friend here? - Tequila? - Oh, fuck that! You think I'm made of money? Get her a rail vodka. - That okay? - Double. He was such a jerk. Well, what do you know about that guy? The fucking hat! Jeez, I thought you'd give more of a shit. Why were you talking to him? Oh my God, I just... What's going on? You don't look well. I have a lot of my own shit right now, okay? Go easier on yourself. You working tonight? Yeah. Not until later. Be safe. Um... I'll be right back. Okay, all right. I swear. - Don't worry about it. - Yeah, no. Just chill out, watch out for that motherfucker, don't let him come back here. I'll be right back, I will be right back. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Look, this is how it's gonna go. We're gonna hook you up, but this is the last time. - Okay. - Okay, Shelly? Uh, yeah. I'm serious. Okay. Shelly. Hey, so did you think about what I asked you? I'm not fucking going. - Really? - Nope. I ain't leaving without you this time. I'm not. I'm not fucking going! - I'm never going with you! - Yeah, really? - That's unfortunate. - I'm working. I'm not going, I'm working. Well, hey, guess what, I know you're working, because I fucking paid for you. But it's all good. I paid for you. - I'm not... - Listen! He just wants to see you, it's not a big deal. Come on, let's go. - No! - Hey, hey! - No! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - No! - Whoa, whoa! What the fuck, you fucking bitch! Ow! Jesus fucking Christ! All you had to fucking do was come with us! - Barry! - Just get the fuck up! - Fuck you! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck is your problem? What's your fucking problem? She just fucking cut me. Oh! Okay! Okay, hello, I guess I'll go fucking bleed somewhere else. Get the fuck out now! We ain't done, bitch! You're out of your fucking element. Out! Oh, thanks for the napkin. Get up, Shelly. - Come on. - Barry... Get up. Thank you. Barry. Hey. What can I get you? Wake up, we gotta go. It's... we're closed. It's time. We're closed? Slow night? Yeah. Think we might have to let you go. Might not be the worst thing. Like, let me go, let me go? Yeah. Okay. It's not like any of us want to be here anyway. Yeah. Look, won't just spring it on you, you know? Wanna make sure you land okay. Wanna let the heat go up. Like, where's your jacket? It's fucking freezing out here. Thanks, Barry. All right. Good night, Shelly. Good night, Barry. Shelly, you home? Rebecca? Francis... Have you seen Shelly? I don't know, like, think about it, like, crazy cat lady, man's best friend. Like, cats are feminine and dogs are inherently masculine. That's how society views them. In theory. - In theory? - Yeah, that's like a cartoon... aspect of it. No, I mean... I don't look at cats and go, "Oh, feminine." I mean, we even sexualize cats, like, with Catwoman and, like, how cats are, like, slinky and everything, and a girl can be... Vagina is called "pussy." Yes, thank you. You are actually making my point for me. But don't get it twisted, I'm not agreeing with this cat theory. No, I think it's obviously a sexism issue nowadays, and women don't get the credit... That was Shelly's car. So what? What do you mean, "so what?" She's my fucking friend. What do you want me... you want me to go back there... - Yes, I do. - ...'cause her fucking car - is parked in a parking lot? - Yes, I do! - I'm trying to go home. - Thomas, turn around. I'm not turning around... Turn the fucking car around, Thomas! Jesus fucking Christ, all right, Jesus. It's been a pretty good week. Um, I talked to Mom on the phone, and she's doing good. Um, she has a visiting day coming up, and I think I'm gonna go see her. She would, uh, she would love if you could come, but we both know that you're tired and... and it's hard for you. Um... I'm still working at the warehouse you set me up at. Yeah, the... the boss, he's a... he's a really good guy, you know. I'm, uh, thinking he might see me through, start, uh, letting me take on more responsibilities. Um... I keep the house nice and clean, and, um, I've been seeing a girl. Yeah, I've been seeing a new girl. Her, uh, her name is Casey. She's, uh, she's really kind. I think you'll like her. Uh, she takes care of people and... I hate to do this, but, um, I have to be getting back to work. Love you. How's she doin'? The usual. Still not responsive. Oh. Here. Thanks, Casey. See you next week, Harry. It's Barry. Mm-hmm. You good, Barry? Yeah. Just holler if you need anything. Come on, Barry, answer the fucking phone, dude. Fuck. Hey, Francis, did you hear what I said? Hey, Rebecca! Her phone's in here. We found her phone. Francis? - Hey, Vic. - Hey. - Glass of water. - Okay. So... We'll get to that. Hey. Do you know Shelly Baker? Yeah. Have you seen her around at all? Why? Look, I'm her roommate, and she didn't come home last night. Could she have just hooked up? Well, then why did we find her car abandoned on the side of the road? Who's we? Some people who care about Shelly. Have you seen her or not? Yeah. Where? Hey. You didn't happen to see Shelly Baker here the other night, did you? Yeah, yeah. Um, she forgot her coat when she left. - Hey, Thomas? - Francis, hey. Okay, have you guys found anything yet? No, no. Okay, so, I just spoke to one of Shelly's coworkers... - Francis. - ..and like, apparently she's not technically missing, - but we found her car, so... - Francis. ...what technically qualifies as missing is like... Francis, shut... Francis, shut the fuck up, man. I'm trying to tell you something, dude. - What? - Well... You know Shelly was using again, right? Fuck, really? Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, it's... fucked up, dude. Goddamn it, Thomas. I know, I know. Oh, fuck. You... - Fuck. - Look, I know this is fucked up, and I think I know what's going on and I can help you, but I need to know you're gonna be fucking cool about it, all right? Look, I think there's someone you should meet. - Hey. - Hey. I'm sorry I wasn't here yesterday. But I'm here now, so... Do you have it? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Hey, Sam, wait. Can I... You look like shit. Everybody slips sometimes, Sam. I don't. I got him that fish movie he wanted. Anything else? It's cold. No, no, I guess not. Ha... have you... Have you heard from your cousin at all lately? You skip out on her half of the rent again? No. Never mind. No. No, I haven't, not in months. Okay. How's she been? I thought she'd been doing better. Guess I'm just worried, is all. She'll make a person do that. Yeah. It's cold. Yeah, no, sorry. Hey, she'll turn up. She always does. Yeah. Hey, what's up? We're in the middle of pr... What? I'm doing what he asked me to do. Well, we're still trying to find her, right? Okay. - So, Vic. - We're done here, Martin. Well, I hear one of your girls went missing. What's your point? Well, I heard she was a little different. - I heard she was slack... - Go home, Martin. - Maybe I can find her for you? - I don't think so. Well, maybe I already know where she is. - Barry! - Just give me like five grand. I swear I'll find her for you. Take a walk. Fine. Fuck that frozen cunt. - Fuck did he want? - A job. Tasteless. They're just hungry. Hello? Okay. Man on his way? Yeah. Do you really think this is the best way to go about things? Why not? It's just too messy. I don't think so. But why? Never pay for something you can get for free, Barry. Hello? Barry, what's up? No, no, no, no. We're, uh, we're looking at all the hospitals like you said, but nothing's turned up yet. Yeah, her roommate. Well, he's a guy. His name's Francis. To be honest, no, I don't get that vibe. In fact, actually, I think he's our best bet at finding her. Can you give me a second? Barry? Yeah. All right, so, he's kind of an AA nut, right? Did a little stint in prison for beating the shit out of his baby mama's new boo, but... I don't know, he's got this white knight thing going on right now, and plus, Shelly being his baby mama's cousin, I don't know, I think he's trying to score some points by helping her stay sober. Yeah, well, she has her secrets, obviously. No, no, no, no, no. All right. Bye. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, bruh. I gotta pat you down. You good. Follow me. Hey. Do you know who I am? I've been out of the game for a while. So I've heard. But do you know who I am? Give us a second. It's okay. Yeah, yeah, I know who you are. So I don't have to tell you why me and Shelly are acquainted? I can guess. Know what I want you to do? I'm assuming you have a list of names, suspects. There's only two. Just two? I'm pretty sure I know what's going on. Explain it to me then. One of them is her brother Saul. Do you know him? That doesn't surprise me. He's kinda reclusive ever since his conviction. What'd he do? Touched a kid. Jesus. The only reason I bring him up is 'cause I've caught him hanging around here a couple times. I thought he might be skeevin'. I also think he was trying to get her to quit, so he might've gotten her to drop off the radar. So who's the other guy? John, goes by King. King? King was all about Shelly. The thing is, though, she wouldn't let him close. And... well, they had an altercation the other night. And if I'm being totally honest, it had been simmering for a while. I didn't handle the whole thing real well. It got dealt with, but not before it got ugly. You see, Francis, guys like King can sometimes get obsessive, and I'm worried that he might've gotten her alone, where we can't protect her. So you think they either have Shelly or know where she is? They might. What's the catch? I'm gonna be straight with you. They owe me and my affiliates money, and I need this done. However, I also appreciate the fact that we live in small towns with a lot of social overlap. There has been a lot of shit flying over your head. I'm giving you an opportunity. Maybe it's time for you to stop playing the victim. I'll send Barry with you. Barry! So, will he do it? He's thinking about it. No, he's not, he's just gonna run... $800. That's Shelly's half of the rent. Okay. Do we know where they are? - Yeah. - Let's go. Hope you know what the fuck you're doin'. Hold up. Hurry up! Slow your role, chief. You got a piece? A gun. I gotta go back to the house to get it. What the fuck. No, don't! Is that it? Yeah. What'd they take? Well, my computer, for one. Jesus fucking Christ. This place is fucking trashed. Yeah. I can't even tell what they took other than her computer. I don't get it. Do you... do you think it was one of these guys Vic was talking about? - Could be. - All right, then let's fucking go. Jesus, what are you, 100? Station broadcasts at a low frequency. Look, can you fucking not? All right. You ready? For what? It's just... things can get intense. How so? Well, for starters, this one time I went to meet this guy who accidentally blew his own face off. - Jesus Christ. - Yeah. Guess he was waiting for me with a shotgun aimed at the door. I was running a little late, and when I walked in, I guess I scared him, and bam! Bullshit. You don't even know the half of it. The super-fucked up thing is, he lived. Now he's got a new face. Well, what's it look like? Ehh... It's not bad, but... it could be worse. Kinda sick, huh? Lost his sense of smell. Okay, this is it. Park over here. See the house up there, white sedan pokin' out? Yeah. That's it. You ready? Yo, you with me? Yeah, yeah. Where the fuck is she, Saul? Fuck, who? Who? You know who the fuck I'm talking about. - Where the fuck is Shelly? - I don't know! - Where the fuck is she? - Don't kill me, please. I swear to God, I will pull this goddamn trigger. - Barry... - Don't look at him. Look, just go to class, all right? I'll be here in three hours. Okay. Grover. Thomas. Can I have my code? This'll put me even, plus a round? This will put you even, plus a round. Here's your baggie, as promised. Get the fuck outta here. Remember, you didn't see me. Right. Oh! Shit. Shit! What? Um... I'm-I'm-I'm required, since you're new in the, uh, neighborhood, I-I'm required by law to inform you that... I'm a convicted sex offender. I'm not required to tell you about the specifics of my crime, but i-if you wanna inquire, you can, uh, call my caseworker, Debbie. Which house is yours? Get the fuck off my property. Where the fuck is she, Saul? Where the fuck is Shelly? - Who? - Who? You know who the fuck I'm talking about! Where the fuck is Shelly? - I don't know! - Where the fuck is she? Don't kill me, please. I swear to God, I will pull this goddamned trigger. - Barry, Barry... - Don't look at him. I swear to God, you're talkin' to me. - Where the fuck is she, Saul? - I don't know! Aww, shit! Go after him! - Fuck! - Fuck, man! Son of a bitch! Lookie there! Hey! Shouldn't have fucking ran, Saul. You okay? Fine. Fuckin' jomo. All right, one more fucking time. Where is Shelly? Shelly's missing? Fuck that! You ran outta here like you know something. You guys scared the shit outta me! I mean, you think that's the first time someone's kicked in my door? I'd rather be killed where I have witnesses. Yeah. Heard you fucked a kid. It's not like that. Then what's it like? Okay, yeah, yeah, it's like that. I oughta blow your fuckin' brains out - right... - Look, look, I've done ten years, I'm in therapy, please! Where's Shelly? She's not with you, Barry? Fuck you think, Saul? Look, yeah, I was trying to talk to her, but... Why? Our dad's lookin' for her. What? Dad, our dad is looking for her. I fuckin' heard you! Why is that bad? Look, he's just bad news, okay? Sorry, Saul. We're gonna need more if we're gonna let you go. Look, why do you think we're so fucked up, huh? Drugs? Fuck you. No. Fuck. My dad's a cruel man, okay? Look. Shelly got the worst of it. Sometimes, I can still hear her whimpering. Look... eventually, CPS came and picked us up and we got bounced around from house to house. But it was too late, though. Francis, you, uh... you went to high school with Shelly, right? Then... then you can attest, I mean... She ran away constantly, and... even back then, it was clear. She'd been hurt. You'd drink too is all I'm sayin'. Look, I... I know what I did was wrong. But, fuck, I... I'm broken too. Saul. I believe you. Look. Do you really wanna help Shelly? Yes... yes, I'd do anything. Then come with us. - We've got another lead. - What? No! Is it King? Yeah. How'd you know? Dad has King looking for her too. Wait. King knows your dad? Yeah, yeah. King and my dad go way back. He's King's boss. Wait... your dad's Fat Dan? Fat Dan? This white supremacist asshole from the '90s. The gang he ran with used to run east of 35E. Yeah, still do. They're still pushing meth, heroin, kids. Didn't Fat Dan go to prison? Went to prison, past tense. Do you know where he is now? No. I been looking for King, though. We know where King is. Shit, let's go, then. Excuse me? Yo, fuck this guy. He is not coming with us. Why not? Look, he's just looking for his sister. You know we could use the extra muscle anyway. What's the problem? The problem, Francis, is that you're forgetting a key part of what we're doing here. You owe me money, Saul. Do you have it? No, but... Fuck, Saul! Fuck! Look. Look, you've roughed me up. If-if-if I help you, can we... can we just call it even? No! How much does he owe? Fuck that. How much? Six. Six hundred. I've got two, though. I'll cover the rest of the four from mine. Fine. Fuck it. He's all you, though. I want it known, I don't like this pedophile fuck. Do not make me regret this. Hey! Francis! Hey, Shelly! Oh! I haven't seen you in, like, three months! Ever since rehab, I've just felt like I'm fucking gutted, just, like, ripped apart. And I've just been drifting. I mean... We're still young. Your twenties are supposed to be kind of a mess. You're just kind of out of the curve. Yeah. Things... things'll get better. At... at what age... at what age are things good? When do things get better? Soon. - Soon, I think. - Yeah. Yeah... I love the way it feels on my feet. Never met a bed as comfortable as the sand. I used to run away here all the time. You ran away? All the time! When you came to my house. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - You want? - Uh-uh. - Uh-uh. - Fair enough. I'm glad I'm beside you. Mm-hm, uh-huh. Hey, Shelly? Mm? Okay. Oh my God. Been looking all over for you. Shh! Been looking all over for you. - Hm. - This place is like a fucking maze. It's actually fuckin' beautiful. It's boorish, is what it is. Oh. Do you have it? Yeah. So... all together, shit came to about 1500. So... we, uh, we good? You know, this collection reminds me of you. Yeah? Chaotic and barely contained. Primitive. And ugly. - What the fuck, Vic? - I'm saying you, like these paintings, are not to my liking. Yeah, I know, I'm fucking gettin' that, Jesus Christ. Wait, are you fucking firing me? I'm firing you. You can't fucking fire me! And I thank you for your service, but I also think we should no longer do business with each other. - Vic, you can't fuckin'... - What? What, Thomas? Did you think I would let you play bookie? No! Did you think that I would let you run a debt train on my employees? No, I wasn't trying to... Vic, I was just trying - to fucking help you, man! - No, you weren't. You were just taking advantage. Shelly? This is the last time I will let anybody, especially you, push anyone over the edge. Let me? You think you fucking let me? I would choose your next words very carefully. Holy shit, Thomas! Thomas, what the fuck? What the fuck is going on? Shut the fuck up! Shut your fucking mouth, Rebecca! For once! Okay, what the hell is going on? You've dragged me all over town and we're barely getting through these fliers, - and now you're... - Fuck the fliers! Fuck the fucking fliers, Rebecca. Fuck Shelly, fuck this whole fucking situation. I'm done with it, I'm fucking done! - Pull over. - No. We're going home. Let me out. - We're going fucking home! - Pull over! Pull over, pull over! Fuck you. Get the fuck out of the car. - Get out of the fucking car. - Gladly. - Fuck you, Thomas! - Fuck you. Shut the fucking door! You shut the fucking door! Rebecca! Fuck you! Goddammit. So that's it? Yeah. Let's go. Ring the bell. It's all you, man. Jesus Christ. Saul! Motherfuckin' Saul! Why, I ain't seen you since you was. What the shit you want? Hey-hey King, uh, have you seen Shelly? Oh, your fuckin' dad sent you, didn't he? Oh yeah. I saw her. I saw her, like, a couple of days ago, and I don't know why this motherfucker didn't tell you that he saw her, because he fuckin' saw her, and guess what? I tried talkin' to her. Woo, doggie, lookit! That bitch fuckin' cut me. And I fuckin' told Dan, I am not lookin' to lose a fuckin' pound of flesh over it. Wait... Dan was looking for her? Uh, yeah. Jesus fucking Christ. And he's looking for this cocksucker, too. - Hey, King! - What? I need you to go get diapers! All right. - And be quick about it! - Yeah! Okay! Jesus fucking Christ. Oh, man. This is where he's at. Just take the goddamned fucking thing. Jesus fucking Christ. Look! Door is locked. That's where he's at. Jesus fucking Christ. That's it? Get off my fucking porch. You know, my fucking neighbors are watching. So, Francis. Mm-hm? You're good at this, you know? You got the right balance of anger and patience. It's good for this line of work. Yeah, I used to do something similar. Where? In prison. Fell in with a guy kinda bringing his own type of justice on the cellblock. Targeted strikes, theft. You name it, I... yeah, it was... it was similar. Hm. Yeah. Meet your kids' new dad? Yeah. Did he... No. No, um, I just didn't like him. Hm. Was drinkin' a lot back then. Fuck you, Derek! What? That's what I should have said. "Fuck you, Derek." Who? King. - His name's Derek? - Yeah, cool name, right? Totally. You're the one to talk. Well, shit, let's not waste no more time, man. Gotta get to Dan's. I-I'm hungry. Fuck. I forgot to collect King's debt. Is there any ketchup? Jesus fuck! Jesus fuckin' Christ, Tara. Hi, Tommy. What's up, baby? Where's Becca? Fuck that bitch. - Yeah? - She's fuckin' nuts. Well, shit! I mean, if you wanted a new boo, you could just, you know, I'm just right here and everything, and I'm... Thank you, baby, I know you are. I know you are. Can I get a hit of that? Got your fuckin' money? Well... most of it. What's our deal? End of the month? Get in. All the information you gave us is really gonna help. We're gonna find her, Rebecca. You did the right thing. - Rebecca... - I don't know, I just... I feel like I... like I let her down. You know? I just... I abandoned her. She just needed help! Hey, Lo? Yeah. Hey, we got a guy out here talking about a missing girl? So, Saul. You think you could tell it again? Come on, let's go. How do you want to play this? Fuck! I can't get this fucking gun in my waistband, what the fuck? Barry! What? Slow? I don't know! Let Saul lead again. I don't know. I'll take lead. Fine! Shit. Let's go. Saul! My God, I-I-I've been looking everywhere for you! Sir, sorry to bother you at such an hour. It's fine, it's fine. Saul! Wow! You look good. Little skinny maybe, but, uh... yeah, good. Dan... can I call you "Dan"? Daniel is-is fine. Daniel. Can we come in? Who's your friend? We need to talk about Shelly. All right. Come in. The wife's asleep, though, so just kinda keep it down, all right? So, uh, Saul. What's it been, uh, 10, 12 years? Watch your head. Fifteen. Fifteen years! Wow! Uh, I just, uh... I can't even, uh... Where's Shelly? What? Sh-Shelly's missing, we can't find her. Shel... Shelly's missing? How long has he... she been missing? You don't know where she is? No! No, no, I... Can I show you something? King's always been a lazy piece of shit, so... I knew I couldn't count on him to find the two of you. So, uh, even before he pussied out on me, I hired this private eye, you know? And, uh... Shit, I know it's here... there it is. Yeah, so this is basically everything I've been able to collect on Jos... um, Shelly. As near as I can tell, he... she was, uh, staying somewhere not too far from here with some fella named Francis? - That's me. - Yeah? I-I-I... I'd really like to see him... her again. If you find her, can you tell her to contact me? I don't think so. What? Wha... Did you tell them? Look, uh... I know. I know that, uh, that I did wrong by the two of you. I-I know. I don't deserve it, Saul, but... if you could just find some way in your heart to forgive... Jesus! What the fuck? What is going on? Daniel? Daniel! Francis. Francis! We gotta go. We gotta go now! Daniel! What the... who the... who are you? What are you doing here? Daniel. Daniel! Oh my God! Oh my God, Daniel, are you all right? Oh... oh my God, oh my God, ohh! Someone do something, someone do something! Oh my God! Gimme your gun, Saul. Gimme the gun! Are you coming? No! He's not. How's your food? I don't even know how you can eat right now. Well, threw up, for one. For two, I was told you should eat through stuff like this. Who told you that? My aunt. My dad was killed when I was a kid. Shot right outside my house. Cops? Nah. My mom. My aunt, she actually brought me here right after that. Shit. I just noticed I'm not even hungry. She brought me here a lot. Shit! What? I know where Shelly is. Fuck. Fuck! What are you doing? Calling the police. No. What? We found her. Let's just fucking end it. No. Fuck you, Barry! You're not thinkin, Francis. This whole fucking thing was pointless, Barry. It was for nothing. She's been here the entire fucking time! Just end it. We'll call in an anonymous tip. No. All right. Fine. But I can't wait to hear how you explain to the police why Fat Dan was killed with your gun. Fuck! - Fuck. - Look. There's a pay phone not too far from here. We can call it in from there. I'm sorry. Come on, man. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, uh... Sam? Hey, what's up? I-I-I'm fine, uh... are you okay? Fine. Are, uh... are you with Paul? Yeah. Oh, um... yeah, is he okay? He's fine. Happy, healthy. Francis, what's going on? I, um... I mean, we... uh... Did you... Uh, she, uh... - ...she... - Francis. I let her down, Sam. I'm so sorry! I killed her! She's dead because of me, I could... I could have done something, but I didn't. I'm so fucking sorry. I'm so sorry. Francis. Yeah? We could take another minute, man. No. Let's go. Take a seat. I'll get you in a minute. Set him up with a whiskey. - It's nine in the morning! - Just do it. Barry! How'd it go? It went like shit. - We found her, though. - Good, okay. So where was she? Overdose. - She had a spot by the river... - Jesus fuck! ...I guess. - She's dead. - Shit! Yeah. How 'bout the other thing? Well, Francis is covering Saul's debt. King's in a bind, so I have to go back. So how did he do? He did good, considering. Oh. Fat Dan's dead. Wait. Why? Saul killed him. - Shot him in the head. - Why, though? You remember that shit Saul always talkin' about? Yeah? I don't think it was all talk. Hm. Thomas, he really did a number on Francis' apartment, too. Well, that validates my firing him. Good. I'm thinking of giving the kid the job. Francis? Yeah. Think he'd go for it? Honestly? Every time I think I know what he's gonna do next, he surprises me. Okay. Why don't you give me a minute and then send him in? Gonna drink that? Fuck! He's ready for you. Little farther, little farther... there you go. Hey. - Did they... - They called. Okay. What's going on? There's, uh, $400 there. Francis. I got a new job. There should be more money coming in. - You don't have to... - I do. I really do, I... I wanna provide for you and Paul. Okay. Do you wanna come in? Another time. You sure? See you, Sam.
