[eerie ambient music] [ominous orchestral music] [vocalizing] - Okay, some potato chips and, oh that's right, some herbal tea. Oh, here it is. [register beeps] That'll be $7.75. - Oh, dear. I could be a few dollars short here. - I'd be happy to put it on account, Mrs. Wilson. - [Mrs. Wilson] Would you? - [Mr. Larson] There you go. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Larson. - Nice seeing you. - Hey Tommy, this totally huge shipment of DCs just came in at Mr. Sumatra's. - Finish that dry spot, Tommy. Then, you can go. [whimsical music] - Here, you want a jellybean? - Thanks. - Hey, who's that? - I don't know. - [Man] Ho, ho, ho, ho. - Hey, kid. You want to ride your bike around here? You gotta pay. [laughs] - Pay? For what? - Protection. [Freddy grunts] - Come on, you guys. - Look, Sally, could you just stay the hell out of this, okay? - [Tommy] Hey, let him go, Booger. [people chattering] - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you boys looking for trouble? I give you all the trouble you can handle. - What, you got a frickin' problem, huh? Get the hell out of here! - Come on, Vinnie. Let's go. - Punks. You ought to be locked up. - [Kid] Go back to work, make an honest dollar. See you later. [kid coughing] - You okay? Come on, get up. You okay? [inhaler sprays] - Yeah, I think so. - You're new around here, huh? - Yeah. I just moved in down on 35th Street. - Well, I'm Tommy Larson. This is my sidekick, Bill turner. - Yeah, right. - Well, my name is Fredrick Mariam Thompson. - Here, you want one? - Yeah, sure. - Do they always call you Fredrick Mariam Thompson? - Well, you can call me Freddie. - [Tommy] That's a relief. - 50 cents, my man. Excellent choice. Excellent. Yes. - Oh wow. Check out the Flash Annual featuring Argus in the Flash. - I'm gonna get the special Crypto Annual. - Hey, and if you get the Green Lantern, then we can swap 'em after. - What's the Green Lantern? - Oh, man. Look, the Green Lantern is not a what. The Green Lantern is a he. - Trust us, you'll like him. Hey, Mr. Sumatra. This is Freddie, he just moved down the block. - Hello, Freddie. - Hello, sir. - Mr. Sumatra to you. Oh Bill, I'd almost forgotten. Something came in that might interest you. - [Bill] Never heard of this flavor. - Manioc, William. A starchy, potato-like root that is very popular in my country. - Wow, thanks, Mr. Sumatra. - Bill's a jellybean junkie. That's all he eats. Here's for the comic. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thanks. Thank you. - Let's get out of here. [playful music] - That guy's kind of weird, huh? - Mr. Sumatra? He's been around here forever. - He's from Haiti. He used to be a magician back home. - [scoffs] No way, he was a policeman. - A policeman? - That's what my old man says. [whimsical music] Green Lantern is the most amazing superhero in the world. - Crypto's infinitely more cool. - Come on, Bill. How can you compare Crypto to Green Lantern? Crypto's a dog, jeez. - Uh-oh. Don't look now. [upbeat orchestral music] - [laughing] Heads up, chums. - [Bill] Hey, give that back. [laughing] Give it back, Pud. - Give me that. I can't believe you guys are still into this crap, huh? When are you idiots gonna grow up anyway? - Come on, give it back, Vinnie. - Just give it back to him. - Ooh. - [Vinnie] What, are you gonna go to bat for this twerp now? - I said, give it back, Vinnie. - [Vinnie] Oh, what are you gonna do if I don't, huh? Call your mother? - Look, jerk. - [Vinnie] Hey, who are you calling jerk, huh? - [Thug] Hey Vinnie, Mr. Sumatra's watching. - I don't care if Mr. Sumatra's watching. - You boys, get out of here! - Hey, why don't you eat this, Mr. Sumatra, huh? - You all heard me! - Come on, Vinnie. Man, let's get out of here. That guy gives me the creeps, all right? - Later, twerp. - [Mr. Sumatra] Go now! [tin can rattling] - You shouldn't have done that, Vinnie. - "You shouldn't have done that, Vinnie." Please. - There's gotta be a way to get those jerks off of our backs. - The only way to handle those guys is stand up to 'em. - I don't think that's such a good idea. - You used to be a policeman, right Mr. Sumatra? - Yes, I've had law enforcement experience in Haiti. - Back when you were a policeman, how would you handle a gang like the Vipers? - I would have collected information on them, and then transmit that information to a special squad of inspectors in the Tonton Macoute. - What, like running surveillance? - Exactly. When in pursuit of malefactors. - What are those? - Evildoers. Criminal, Freddie. When one deals with malefactors, one must have great diligence. Only then, may expose the soft parts beneath the underbellies. Leaving them bleeding, sorrowful for trial. - [Freddie] The cops in Haiti sound pretty scary. - Yes, Freddie. Cops in Haiti are extremely scary. [laughing] - [Sally] Hi, Tommy. - Oh, hi. Hi, Sally. - I just want to let you know that I'm really sorry about yesterday. Vinnie just gets like that sometimes. I don't know why. - Maybe he's just got a bad character. - [Sally] Vinnie has good qualities. - Sure could've fooled me. - He's had a lot of trouble at home. - Having trouble doesn't mean you go out terrorizing the entire neighborhood. And he's your boyfriend? - What's that supposed to mean? - Think about it. - Hello, Sally. Something wrong? Um, do I detect a little girlfriend troubles here, son? - Ah, Dad, it's not like that at all. [tires squealing] [whimsical music] [horn honking] - Oh, hey, Sally. Hey, Sally. Come on, you're not still mad, are you? - Go away. - Oh, come on, lighten up. - What you did yesterday was really awful. - Come on, that guy's a total wimp. - Tommy Larson's not a wimp. - Oh, what? So you're all in love now? - That doesn't even deserve an answer. - Watch out, Vinnie! [tires screech] [speaking foreign language] [horn honking] - Sally? Sally. Are those boys bothering you? - Nothing I can't handle, Mr. Sumatra. [mischievous orchestral music] [chimes twinkling] [tires squealing] - Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Jesus, stop the car, man! Come on, come on! - There's no brakes, man! [tires screeching] [trash thudding] Shit! - [Booger] Why don't you watch where you're going, man? - [Vinnie] Why don't you shut the hell up, all right? - Where'd you learn to drive, Vinnie? - [Vinnie] Shut up! - God damn it! - Jesus! [metal bangs] - You know they're gonna come after us. - So, what else is new? Those guys have been after us since kindergarten. Aren't you getting a little tired of running from Vinnie Benedetti? - I've only been here three days and I sure am. - Well hey, if we don't stand up to those guys, we're always gonna be looking over our shoulder. - I think I better be heading home. - Yeah, I better go, too. - All right. [playful music] - Well, later, Tommy. - See you later, Tommy. - See you guys later. Oh buddy, you think you're bad. Well, I'm the baddest of the bad. Yeah. [grunts] Yeah. - Hey, Tommy! What are you doing? - Um, nothing. - I know it's kind of late, but you think maybe we could talk? - Sure. You want me to come down? - [Sally] That's okay, I'll come up. [metal grinding] - [Tommy] So, how come you're out on a school night? - My mom and dad were fighting again. I couldn't handle it. - [Tommy] Sorry. - Don't worry about it. I was thinking about what you said the other day. I don't know why I thought Vinnie could change. I'm not gonna see him anymore, though. - Well, it's about time. - And besides, I like someone else now. - Oh, great. Who's the lucky guy? - Well, he's really, really nice and he works really hard in his dad's grocery store. [light orchestral music] You're trembling. - No, I'm not. - Hey, that's Old Lady Wilson's car. [metal clanging] Come on. [whimsical music] Tonton Macoute Two calling Tommy. Tonton Macoute Two calling Tommy. Tonton Macoute Two calling Tommy, over. - What's that? - It's just Bill Turner. - [Bill] Come on Tommy, would you pick up already? - Sounds kind of important. - What do you want? - The Vipers are pulling apart Old Lady Wilson's car on Carter Avenue behind your building right now. - Man, this is it. [light orchestral music] - What do you think you're doing? - We're gonna bust the Vipers. - Are you crazy? When Vinnie finds out he'll kill you. - We're not afraid of Vinnie anymore and you shouldn't be either. - Tommy! [upbeat orchestral music] [metal clanging] [Vipers chattering] [uptempo jazz music] - Get the lamps and the tires. Come on, guys. Come on, hurry it up already! - We're hurrying, we're hurrying! [whistle echoing] - All right, you guys know what to do, all right? Now, move, move! - [Man] Let's go, let's go. [police siren blaring] - All right you guys, hold it right there! - Ah, Connors, we was just walking, right? And here you are rousting us again. - Well, if it isn't Booger Martin, and Podowski, too. - [Booger] Oh, man. - I should have known. Look at the car down there. See that car? That car looks like it's been stripped. - [laughs] You don't see us lugging any parts, do you? - You got a big mouth, you know that? - He's lying, Officer. I can prove it. - [Officer] What? - Here, push the red button. - [Booger] What's this? - Holy smoke. That looks like a felony being committed. Oh yes, that is a felony being committed right there. All right, come on, come on, come on. Assume the position. - You're gonna pay for this Larson! You hear me? - Shut up, Booger! - Aw, look at the tough guys. You guys think you're tough now, huh? - Ah, screw you, Tommy! We'll be out of jail two hours max. You better, ow! We're gonna come looking for you and your punk friends. - [Gang Member] You're dead meat, Tommy! Dead meat, man! - [Podowski] Take it easy! We'll get you punks. We didn't do anything. - We better get used to it. We're dead meat. - If I die, I'm gonna die happy. - [Bill] Speak for yourself. - Sally? - You shouldn't be seen here. - Yeah, well, this is my neighborhood, too. [light orchestral music] [uptempo jazz music] - Hey Big Moe, we gotta talk. - [Big Moe] So, talk. - I got a problem. All right, my boys all got pinched and I need to raise three grand to bail them out. - What do I look like, a bank? - Oh, Big Moe. You're so mean. - You keep quiet. You're whole gang you say, eh? How did you manage that? - These kids from the neighborhood growing up to be a real pain in the ass. One of 'em shot a video while we were pulling apart some old biddy's car and he gave it to the cops. - Vinnie, I've been trying to bring you along. Huh? You know? Now, I gotta know. [Vinnie groaning] You turning soft, Vinnie? - No, Big Moe. I ain't turning soft. - [laughs] Good. Bring them troublemakers here tomorrow night, huh? I'm gonna show you how to handle punks. Count me out three grand! [upbeat jazz music] [laughing] [sniffing] - Ah, freedom. - Oh, yeah, well. Shut up and enjoy it later 'cause we got work to do, all right? - Hey Vinnie, how'd you make our bail so fast? - I got Big Moe to spring for it, pud. - Ah, I never knew she cared. - Oh, you're a comedian, Booger. You're a real fucking comedian. Let's get out of here. [suspenseful orchestral music] [tires squealing] - [Bill] You happy now, the Vipers. Oh, man. [grunting] - [Tommy] Where do you think you're taking us, Vinnie? - [Vinnie] Shut the fuck up! - [Booger] Yeah, you're gonna like our friend. [laughing] - Come on, come on, go. [whimsical music] - Hey Big Moe, these are the twerps that got the guys pinched. - Ah, the photographer. What are your names? I asked a goddamned question. - My name is Tommy Larson and this is Bill. - What's the matter with your pals, they can't talk for themselves? You, what's your name? - His name is Freddie. - For now, you're gonna get off with a warning. I want you to keep your mouths shut. What do you say? - I say Vinnie Benedetti's a rat bastard who belongs in a jail cell. [body thuds] - [laughs] We got ourselves a tough guy. [laughing] You should think about coming to work for me. - Doing what Vinnie does? Robbing people, breaking heads? - It's a living. - Nah, I don't think so. - That's a shame. Now, I gotta figure out what to do with ya. But, right now, I got business. That the last of it? - Yeah. All day's actions. Where do you want it? - [Big Moe] In the back, we'll count it out later tonight. - Yo, Big Moe, your Irish pals just pulled up outside. - [Big Moe] Let 'em wait. I want you should take these punks into the storeroom. I want you should tie 'em up real good, then I want you should get lost 'cause I got business now, huh? - Got any more bright ideas? - I've almost got it loose. Come on, work it for me, Freddie. - I just want to go home. - Come on. You wanna die? [grunting] - [Big Moe] [laughs] Yeah. Oh, and I'm getting boxes of Maine lobster for each of ya, huh? - Hey, Big Moe. - [Bill] Hey Tommy, what's all this? - They're number slips. If something were to happen to these, it would really screw up Big Moe's operation. - I just want to get out of here. I don't care about any stupid pieces of paper. - No, no, listen. Whosever got a bet here, could say they picked any number at all and Big Moe won't be able to tell if they're telling the truth or not. She'd have to pay 'em all off. - Look, it's one thing having the Vipers mad at us, but Big Moe's in a whole different league. - [breathing heavily] He's right, Tommy. [inhaler spraying] - [Big Moe] Now, bring me them snot-nosed kids. - They're coming! Um, we can get out through there. Put these chairs up on there. [all chattering] - [Big Moe] I ain't got all day. [all chattering] - [Bill] Don't make him do it, Tommy. It's crazy. - [Man] Hey, it's locked. - This is the only way out. Go! - [Man] Come on, kids. Come on, open it. - [Freddie] You're crazy. - [Bill] Forget the sacks, we don't need 'em. - [Tommy] That's one. - [Freddie] Come on, Tommy. Man, you are crazy. - [Bill] Come on, quick. - [Man] Open the door! What is with you? - [Tommy] Come on, we gotta at least get the last one. Come on. - That's it. I got a nice surprise for you. Come here, come here. [grunting] Right in the face, you little punk. [banging on metal] Moe, Moe! Them punks took the whole day's actions from the Port District! Everything! - My slips? - Everything I says! - Took my slips? - Everything! - Jesus Christ! Get 'em back! [knocking on door] [suspenseful orchestral music] - All right, all right, all right. - Them punks you brought over, they got loose. [suspenseful orchestral music] - So, I mean, they live here. Where are they gonna go? - They took my slips. You hear me? My slips. - Holy shit. - Yeah, and seeing as they're from your turf kind of makes it your responsibility. The only way that I can see you making it up is by working it off. - Whatever you say, Big Moe. - Yeah. - What, you want me to take care of it like this? - What? You ain't up for it, kid? - Yeah, I'm up for it. [laughing] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Man, this is taking forever. - What, you got a fucking problem with it, Booger? Because if you do, you can take it right to Big Moe because this is coming straight from her. - Just take it easy, okay? Just take it easy. - Oh, man. Look, there they are. - [Tommy] It's all right. We don't have much further to go. - If my Aunt Lacey catches me sneaking in at this hour- - Don't worry, Freddie. After this is over, you're gonna be a hero. [suspenseful orchestral music] - [Vinnie] Now goddamnit, do it now, do it now! [guns cocking] [guns firing] Get the sacks. Get the fucking sacks! [Booger yells] [engine starting] [tires squealing] [Police sirens blaring] - Tommy! - Oh, you did good, Vinnie. Broke your cherry, huh? [Big Moe laughing] What, what, you getting a case of the nerves? - [sighs] Look, them punks we whacked, I mean, they were just kids, you know. I was just thinking about what would've happened if we got pinched. - Whacked? What do you mean, whacked? I thought you was just gonna rough 'em up a bit. - That's right, that's right. Vinnie just gave 'em a couple of slaps, you know. Gave 'em a bunch of whacks, that's all. What is this, you think we go around killing kids? Oh, jeez, honey. - But, he said- - Yeah, well you just forget about what he said, huh? Yeah, now you go on now, huh? I got business. - Okay. - Hey! [snapping fingers] Take her home. - Okay, okay. I just got a little scared. - It's all right. Anybody gets pinched, Vinnie, it's gonna be you, so don't go turning punk on me now. I need you. [upbeat jazz music] - Man, this is bad. This is really fucking bad. - Hey, you did what you had to do. Now that I see you can handle it, I'm gonna make you my right hand man in the neighborhood, huh? You'd like that wouldn't you, Vinnie? - Sure I'd like it. - Yeah, sure you would 'cause you're a smart kid and you're job's gonna be making sure that everyone in the neighborhood that does business with us pays us a percentage. Think you can handle that? - Yeah, I can handle it. [Big Moe laughs] - Yeah, well. Look at that. Come here. I want you to go get yourself some clothes. You're working for me now. Oh, oh, oh. And, oh, I want you to watch your mouth around Mitzi, huh? She's a sensitive girl, Vinnie. - Sure thing, Moe. [tense music] [woman crying] - What has happened here, Sally? - They're dead, Mr. Sumatra. - Who's dead? - Tommy, and Bill, and that new kid. They're dead, just murdered. [Mr. Sumatra growls] [dramatic orchestral music] - Please accept my condolence, Mr. Larson. This is a most very tragic loss. Truly, like a dagger in my liver. Sally. [mysterious music] [casket creaking] [casket creaking] [casket creaking] [liquid bubbling] Here, my boys. What trouble you've gotten yourselves into now. Oh well, nothing to do but this. [liquid splashes] - Hey look, I just want to talk, okay? - I have nothing to say to you, Vinnie. - Just hear me out, please? Look, I just wanted to let you know that I'm really sorry about what happened to Tommy Larson. - [sighs] Yeah, right. You hated Tommy Larson. - Sure, I was pissed at the guy, but I didn't want him dead. - [Sally] You weren't at his funeral. - I didn't exactly feel welcome and then I got to thinking about what would've happened if the same thing had happened to me and I just didn't like the idea. What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm going straight. - Yeah, right. - You can laugh if you want. I'm gonna go to night school, become a business man, learn how to steal a million all legal like. Look, I'm just kidding, all right? Could you smile for me, please? You got a beautiful smile, you really do. - [Mr. Sumatra] Good afternoon. - What's up with that freak? - Don't you dare say anything bad about Mr. Sumatra. - I wasn't going to. - Then, say you're sorry. - I'm sorry. Okay? You happy now? - Mrs. and Mr. Berkowitz, what a pleasant surprise. - Mr. Sumatra, there's been a terrible stench coming from your apartment. - As you can see, this cat has not been well at all. That is the source of that terrible stench, but please be patient. The doctor of cats has predicted that he will soon be bursting with health. Goodnight. Until tomorrow. [liquid bubbling] [ominous orchestral music] [vocalizing] Here's a nice fat pussy cat for seasoning, my boys. Split as you please. [laughing] Now, my boys, it is time for your awakening. In the most high name of the most high spirit. In the name of the most high line of Judea, Haile Selassie. In the name of the most high duvalier and the Tonton Macoute, I command you awaken. [thunder crashes] Awaken. [electricity zapping] What have we here? An accuse ball, how rare. [laughing] - I can't feel my body. - You're a spirit animating flesh now, Tommy. Behold, Bill and Freddie are here with you, too. [light orchestral music] I command you to awaken, William. I command you to awaken. - Maybe he'd rather stay dead, Mr. Sumatra. - Nonsense. Nonsense, Tommy. I shall entice him. Eat the Wizzo, eat the Wizzo, now. He awakens. He awakens, Tommy. Eat it, eat it. Eat it, now. Eat, Bill. - Oh, gross. - Munch, Munch. Awaken, Freddie. I command you. [electricity zapping] - What was that? - You're drawing electricity from the air, Tommy. It stimulated him. - Look out, they have guns! - It's okay, Freddie. It's all over now. - I feel so weird. I feel like. Tommy, are we dead? - You're no longer dead, Freddie. I have boiled you and I have lovingly dried you. I have- - Yeah, and made us into shrunken heads. Thanks a lot, Mr. Sumatra. - Ah, William. You have awakened fully. [laughs] - This is so bad. This is so bad. - I want to see my Aunt Lacey. - I won't be like this. I'd rather be dead. - William, you cannot mean such a thing. - If being this way means laying out on a table all the time. Yeah, he means it. You three will have the power to soar the heavens. - How do we do that? You gonna go get a golf club and knock us around? - You may have lost everything below your chin, William, but not your sense of humor. - Yeah, right. - So, hear me now. Powerful and unknown abilities await your discovery and I shall guide you into this new and remarkable existence. - Hey, hey! No, no! - Use your mind. Use your mind to stay in the air for good. [Tommy yelling] Great, Tommy. Great. [Freddie yelling] - [Bill] Hey, don't touch me. Hey, let go. No, no! - Fly, my children, fly. Round, round. [Freddie yelling] Good. Come to me, children. Come to me now. Here in my condominium you will be safe. Revenge will be your sustenance and as your thirst for vengeance grows and blossoms, and all traces of your humanity begin to vanish, you will find yourself not only able to fly, but to kill. [electricity zapping] [explosion booming] [whimsical jazz music] - Well, what do you know, Mr. Larson. Is it that time of the month already? - Hey, you don't mind do ya? It's really hot out there. - Just take it and go. The sight of you makes me want to vomit. [Booger and Podowski laughing] [knocking on door] - Yeah? - Hey, there's 1,900 in there. We'll get the rest in the morning. - You handle that thing yet with Mr. Sumatra? - Oh, Mr. Sumatra? No, not yet. - Come here. What the hell's wrong with you? That old freak is the only son of a bitch in the neighborhood who ain't kicking back a percentage. - You know how I hate being near that guy, right? - Look, Booger, you do your job or I'll find somebody who can. - Okay, okay. Jesus, man. - Get out! Get out of here! [mysterious orchestral music] [liquid bubbling] - Awaken, my children. Are you ready to be tested? - [All] Yes, master. - [Mr. Sumatra] So, go now. Fly. Rise into the night and do as you've been taught and may all of your dreams come true, my boys. My dear, dear boys. [light orchestral music] - [Thug] Big juicy legs and a big fat- - [Girl] Get off me. [man grunts] [metal clangs] [spray hisses] You, cretans. - Shit! [grunting] She's still got her purse. I'm still going for it. [woman screaming] [wind whooshing] [light orchestral music] [hissing] [electricity zapping] [blade clicking] [woman grunting] [metal slicing] [gasping] [woman yells] - Stinky, man. What's the matter? - [Tommy] Go ahead, malefactor. Make our day. [whimpering] [electricity zapping] [man yelling] - The change comes faster now. - Master said our first kill would quicken the transformation. - And as we continue to nurture our hate, the loss of our humanity will quicken ever more. - You will now await my return. [light orchestral music] [dreamy orchestral music] [electricity zapping] The master was right. There's nothing more for us in this world now, except for revenge. [horn blowing] - Have you drawn blood, my children? - We have found evildoers. - [Bill And Freddie] They will do evil no more. - Excellent. Excellent, my wonderful boys. My just, and wonderful boys. [electricity zapping] [groaning] [farting] - We really fucked up this time, Stinky. [gurgling] [grunting] [Stinky farting] - [News Reporter] A new and frightening disease seems to be attacking local criminals throughout the city. The mystery illness is characterized by a peculiar shuffling gait, a total loss of bowel control, and a compulsion to pick up litter and clean graffiti. Victims exhibited an alarming drop in blood pressure. [phone ringing] Making it impossible to locate a pulse or respiration. What doctors call a pseudo walking death gait. The Center for Disease Control urged the public not to panic unless they have criminal records. - Hello? - Yeah, I just got out of class, now. - [Sally] They give you a ton of homework also? - Well, there's a movie later. I thought maybe you'd like to go to it. - [Sally] Yeah, I guess so. - Okay, I'll pick you up around seven. - [Sally] Okay, bye, Vinnie. - All right, bye-bye. [upbeat jazz music] - Are you still pulling that girl's chain? - Hey, a guy's gotta do what a guy's gotta do, huh? - Yeah, well you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Telling her you're still in school. - Hey Vinnie, what movie you gonna see, huh? - Don't you fucking worry about what movie, Booger. All right? What you ought to be worried about is what I'm gonna do to you if I hear you ain't taking care of that Sumatra thing yet. - Look, I'm telling you, man. That guy's into a real bad scene, all right? - I can't believe that you're actually afraid of a broken down old loser like that. What the hell's wrong with you? - You tell 'em, Vinnie. - Maybe you think it's a little thing, right? Maybe you think it's a little thing, huh? I don't think it's a little thing, okay Booger? You know why? Because it's principle. - I don't think it's no little thing, Vinnie. - All right, look. If I have to ask you again, all right, I might just lock you up in a closet with that old fucking freak. Now, how would you like that, huh? - All right, I'll take care of it. Just lighten up. - Go. Get out of here. [mid tempo jazz music] [Big Moe laughing] - You're learning, kid. - Inquiring minds want to know, Mrs. Wilson. - Oh, Mr. Sumatra. - And what do you malefactors want? - Relax, Mr. Sumatra, this ain't gonna take long, all right? - I gotta admit, Mr. Sumatra. It's been awful peaceful around here lately. No burglaries, no robberies, nothing being run on the shopkeepers. - You mean the shopkeepers who pay for protection. - Oh, yeah. We do a pretty good job. - And now you come to me for payment? - Look, Mr. Sumatra. You've been benefiting. Why shouldn't you pay like everyone else, right? - Of course, I am the one who will pluck out your tongue with bolt cutters and roast them, and I shall take your brain and chill them for the purpose of garnishment. - Those are some pretty good reasons. Huh, Booger? - Yeah. [laughing] Oh, man, did you see that? - What, I didn't see nothing. - That's it, man! I don't care no more! I'm out of here! I don't care no more! - Where are you going, man? [laughing] - Fuck Vinnie, man. Fuck him. I told him Mr. Sumatra was into a bad scene and let him take care of it himself. I don't fucking care no more! I don't fucking care! - Hay, wait up, Boog. - Two of your enemies were here moments ago. - [All] Where, master? - There go the malefactors now. [slow jazz music] - Hey man, let me hang at your pad tonight. - I don't know. - Come on, be a pal. My mom won't let me in the house. - Your own mom won't let you in the house? - Yeah, she says I scare her. - [laughs] All right, come on, asshole. - Hey, thanks, Boog. Thanks a lot. [mischievous orchestral music] [laughs] Hey, so, Boog. Don't you want to watch TV or something? - Nah, man. I gotta take a shower. And don't be whining when I turn it off either. I gotta get some sleep. I don't wanna have to keep seeing that old bastard's face no more. [wind whooshing] [suspenseful music] [blade slicing] [electricity zapping] [laser blasts] [light zapping] - I just don't want to, Vinnie. - [Vinnie] "I just don't want to, Vinnie." - You think that's funny? - [Vinnie] Aw, look, come on, Sally. You know how I feel about you, right? - That's not the point. I'm just not ready. - Well, what do you mean you're not ready? I mean, you're almost 16, right? - Look Vinnie, if you can't wait, then maybe you better find yourself another girlfriend. - All right. Walk home. - [Sally] I will. - I hope you get run over, you dumb-ass little bitch. [dramatic music] [distant moaning] - Hey, Booger, man. You still in there? Damn. [grunting] Man, you've been in there for three hours. What, you fall asleep in here? Damn, this water's freezing. You okay, Boog? Boog? [mouth sucking] Oh, man. Oh, man. [yells] What the- [Podowski crying] [electricity zapping] [horn honking] - Hey, Sumatra! Freakin' molinyan. [horn honking] Sumatra get out here! I wanna talk to you! - What do you want, doomed one? - Hey, who you calling doomed? I'll break your goddamned head. Now listen, I'm looking for Booger and Pud, and I know that you've seen 'em because they were on their way over here to see you. - Your friends are suffering the torments of hell for their terrible sins and soon it will be your turn. - Sins, what do you know about my sins? - Your friends are in the alley over there. - All right. All right. I'll see you later, afro pops. [whimsical music] What do you two idiots think you're doing, huh? You think this is funny? - Hey, Vinnie. What's happening? Want to help us weed the garden? [farting] - [Booger] Mr. Sumatra wants to see you now. [gagging] [light orchestral music] - Hi, Tommy. I know I haven't visited you lately, but I never forget about you. I wish I had the courage to tell you how I really felt. [sniffling] I guess I was afraid you would laugh, so I'm gonna tell you now. I love you, Tommy. Even when we were little, I think I loved you. I wish you were here so badly. - I am here, Sally. [Sally gasping] Don't be afraid, Sally. It's me. It's me, Tommy. - [Sally] Oh my god, no. - Mr. Sumatra brought me back from the dead. It was Vinnie who murdered me, Sally. - [Sally] No, I can't believe this. I won't. [chimes ringing] - I will show you, Sally. I will implant my memories inside your skull and you will know the truth. Bear witness, Sally. Bear witness as my life was so cruelly torn from me in the prime of my youth. Mr. Sumatra came to where I lie awaiting burial, severing my head from my corpse. He prepared my head so that it could receive my restless, wandering spirit once more. And when he raised me from the dead, he taught me to use my special powers so that I could revenge upon Vinnie and his friends for so cruelly murdering me at such a young and tender age. [electricity crackling] Now you know what happened that night, Sally. Our love was cut short. - Oh my god, Tommy. - Let me be close to you now, Sally. Let us share a last embrace. - How can we do that? - I will show you, Sally. - Ah, Tommy! What are you doing? Oh, god. I can't stand it! Tommy, wait! Tommy, come back, please! [wind whooshing] [knocking on door] - [Mr. Sumatra] Who is at my door there? - Sally Conway, Mr. Sumatra. Open the door. I want to see Tommy. Where is he? - My girl, you're suffering from delusions. - I'm coming in. [liquid bubbling] - Sally, you've never been at my condo. Thirsty perhaps? - Don't play dumb with me, Mr. Sumatra. I saw Tommy with my own eyes and he showed me things. I don't know how, but he did. - Have a seat, Sally. Please? - He said Vinnie Benedetti killed him. - That is true. - I dated Vinnie for nearly a year. If you knew he was a killer, why didn't you warn me? - Good and wholesome girls in their teens experience loving feelings in their hearts for evildoers, Sally. But, my three boys will avenge. - Wait a second. How many are there? - You seen Tommy? Behold. The other three together. - Jesus god in heaven, Mr. Sumatra. How could you be so cruel? - Cruel? - It is. It's the cruelest thing there ever was. - No, no, no, Sally. For these boys are no longer human in any sense of the word. These beings that you confront now shed no tears, have no sympathy, nor do they suffer, Sally. What animates them now is the desire for revenge. - I refuse to believe that. Tommy was too good of a person. He cared about people. He believed in doing the right thing until it got him killed. - He was a fine boy, that is true, but- - His body maybe dead, but Tommy's spirit, that's a different thing altogether. Nothing can touch that. - Perhaps you're right, my child. Love can do many strange and wonderful things. - Forgive me, Sally. I know I disgust you now. - No, it was just the shock of seeing you like that, but you're still Tommy and if you disgusted me, I wouldn't be able to do this. [ethereal music] - Never have I seen or heard of a human head made so small to show affection of this sort. - I told you Tommy's spirit wouldn't just roll over and die. [light orchestral music] - I will leave you alone to afford you privacy. [ominous music] [gun clicking] [breathing heavily] [gun cocking] [clock ticking] [farting] [groaning] [screaming] [gun firing] - [Booger] Sumatra wants you, Vinnie. - [Vinnie] Let me go! Let me go! [grunting] [farting] [screaming] [glass shattering] - [Podowski] Oh, Vinnie. - Mr. Sumatra wants to see you now, Vinnie. [Vinnie screams] [farting] [suspenseful music] [groaning] - Mr. Sumatra, man. Call these fucking things off, man. I swear to god I'll do anything, please. Fucking please. [suspenseful orchestral music] [wind whooshing] Oh, shit! - Mr. Sumatra wants to boil your head, Vinnie. - Come on, it'll be fun. [all laughing] [liquid bubbling] - Is that really the uniform they wore in the Tonton Macoute? - Oh yes, my child, and I wore it proudly back in my homeland. - So, what's the big occasion? - Tonight I wish to set up all accounts. Are you anxious? - Yeah, but I have a lot of faith in you. What do you have cooking in here now? - Special recipe for Vinnie and his evil comrade, Big Moe. - Is there anything I can do to help? - Yes, but are you ready, Sally, for capital punishment Haitian style? - Capital punishment? I don't know. What would I have to do? - Before we proceed, I must ask you something. Take care how you answer, for this is very, very important. I must know now, Sally. Is your maidenhead intact? - [chuckles] If you're asking if I'm a virgin, yeah I am. - Hmm. Only a female who has never had a male member inside of her body can complete this particular spell. - You aren't gonna sacrifice me or anything, are you? - Of course not, my dear child. Go into my bedroom and dress in the gown in my closet and I will wait for you here. [tense music] I only wish my old comrades in the political section were alive to see you at this moment. They would be greatly charmed. - Thank you, Mr. Sumatra. [horn blowing] - [Mitzi] Oh, it's gorgeous! Oh, you shouldn't have! - [Big Moe] It's no big deal. - Put it on me. Oh, put it on me. [giggles] [door clicking] - Booger and Pud are dead. They're fucking dead. They got whacked- - Oh, jeez. - Be quiet, Mitzi. - [Vinnie] But now they're walking around fucked up and now they want to fuck me up just like they're- - Hey, slow down, Vinnie. Tell me. Who's dead? - [Vinnie] Booger and Pud. It was the fucking heads. - What's that you're talking about, heads? - Heads, little heads! They're flying around! They've got ponytails, they've got teeth, they've got bugged out eyes! They belong to Mr. Sumatra! They're little and they're brown! They're flying around, they're chasing me all over the fricking place and that ain't the worst of it! At first they were all messed up, Booger and Pud, right? But, now they're really fricking messed up. I mean, they got, they got, they got, skin falling off of their face, they're chasing me around everywhere, they got maggots falling off out of their mou- [electricity zapping] They got the lights. They got the lights and they're coming after me. - Listen, Vinnie. I think you've been under a little stress lately. You know, I know this beautiful little broad, she's got a condo down in Florida, maybe you can- - You don't believe me? You stupid bitch, they're coming for us! - All right, get out of my face. - We're all gonna be dead! - Get out of here! Get him out of here! - [Vinnie] I'm not your man, I'm not. Get off me. [gun fires] - Lieutenant Colonel Aristide Pierre Le Fete Sumatra of the Tonton Macoute, retired. - What the hell? - You know will be bound over to my condominium for zombie vacation. - Kill the old man! [groaning] [guns firing] [punches thudding] [gun firing] [suspenseful orchestral music] - [Man] Get away from me! [laughing] [thudding] [laughing] - Sally, Sally. Look, you gotta call these things off. I mean, talk to Mr. Sumatra, just get these things off of me. - Sorry, Vinnie. You're gonna have to answer for Tommy. - Oh, for Christ's sake, please! - Let's do it. - Behold our bitching tube saw, Sally. [whirring] - No! - Not, my children! Remember, our revenge must be consummated at my condominium. - [Big Moe] Call them fucking things off, now! - There's no power on Earth that can save you from your day of reckoning, woman. [gun fires] - Mitzi? Mitzi, come on out of there. - Somebody just tell me what's going on here. - Everything is gonna be all right now, baby. - What's happening? - We're gonna go on a little vacation, okay? Let go of my arm. Go get in the car, the two of you, now. - Okay, yeah. Okay. - Yeah, come on. [uptempo music] [car starting] - Sally. [tires squealing] - [Mr. Sumatra] Careful, boys. - Why is this happening? - That's a very good question, Vinnie. - Won't somebody tell me why this is happening? - Huh? Huh? - Okay, it's them heads. - Huh? - You remember them kids we whacked last year? Those are their heads and Mr. Sumatra has brought 'em back from the dead. - You did kill them kids, you did. - No, Mitzi, no, no. Vinnie, he's been under a lot of stress lately. He don't know what he's talking about. - Vinnie may have pulled the trigger, but your gangster friend gave the order. - [Big Moe] Keep quiet. Look, the both of you keep your mouth shut. - Oh, no! Shit! - You can run, but you cannot hide. - [Vinnie] Sumatra's behind us! - Jesus Christ, will you slow down? - You will not get away this evening. Not this night. [laughing] [tires squealing] - [Mitzi] Slow down, you're gonna kill us! - [Big Moe] Will you watch out! - [Mitzi] Vinnie, Vinnie, no, this is crazy! - Take it easy. Take it easy, kid. - Are you ready for the Apocalypse? [people booing] For thy heaven's at hand! [people booing] The moment approaches and the faithful shall be cleansed, brothers and sisters. Cleansed in the fire of the Holy Apocalypse. [people cheering] - [Big Moe] Vinnie, slow down. [car horn honking] [tires screeching] - Shut the fuck up! [people cheering] [man shouting] [metal banging] [screaming] - Oh, jeez. All them people. - I hope them poor bastards can swim. - You almost got us killed, you idiot. - Hey, hey, hey, I would rather be killed. Killed, you hear me? Killed, than turned into one of them puff bag zombies. - Even suicide wouldn't save you, Vinnie. - I want out of the car. Pull over. - Shut up. - Pull over. - Shut up, Mitzi. - Pull over! - [Both] Shut up! [sirens blaring] - He's gonna stuff you in an iron pot he has in his apartment and he's gonna cook you, Vinnie, and you're gonna feel it all! - Shut up! - You're not gonna be able to move, not scream, not even cry, Vinnie. - Shut up! - You may as well give up now 'cause Mr. Sumatra's gonna get you no matter what you do. - Shut your friggin little traitor mouth! [laughing] - If anybody's lying it's you, Vinnie. You said you were going to become a business man. - [Big Moe] You're making a mountain out of a molehill here. - Oh, cause you got a bunch of dead people chasing us around. - [Vinnie] Look, you know what? We really could have had it all, we could have done it all. - [Mr. Sumatra] Now, my boys. Our enemies are in sight. Go. [Mr. Sumatra laughing] [blade clicks] - [Vinnie] Holy shit! [Vinnie screams] - This is the fun of the chase. ♪ I'm so happy ♪ Things seem rather grim [blade grinding] ♪ Time, yeah ♪ We've only done so many tricks ♪ ♪ No one has ever known [knife grinding] [Sally yells] [gun fires] [screaming] - What? What? [screaming] Holy shit! Jesus Christ! - Okay. I've just about enough from you. - [Freddie] Give it up, lady. You're under arrest. - Ah, you want some, too? [gun fires] - Get the rest! Get the fucking rest! - Keep rolling, I'll take care of the rest! [gun fires] Two down. - One more and we are home free! [laughing] - [Big Moe] There you go, Vin. - [Sally] Give it to 'em, Tommy. - Look at me go. [screaming] Sally, look at me go. Look at me go, Sally. Look at me go. [glass breaking] [girls screaming] - [Big Moe] Oh, no. Spit it out, Vinnie. Watch it, Vinnie! [tires squealing] [trash banging] Get rid of that thing. [electricity zapping] [gagging] [head thudding] - Let's talk deal. You don't want nothing bad to happen to the little girl and I don't want to be turned into one of them things. - What was done to these creatures is not for the like of you, woman. These zombies are able to walk the Earth for a short period of time before they deteriorate into brown liquid. What I have reserved for you is far more permanent. - Yeah? Well then, let's all go to hell together, huh? What are you doing? [gun fires] - I ain't gonna let you hurt no more kids, Big Moe. - Time has come, woman. Accept your fate. - We'll see who's time. [electricity zapping] [mysterious orchestral music] - You're bleeding pretty bad, Mr. Sumatra. - I have healing infusions at my condo, Sally. We will go there now. - Hey, what do you want to do with me? - You can go wherever you please, little flashy one. All I ask is that you do not reveal what you've seen here this evening. - Don't worry, Mister. Nobody will believe this in a million years. I'll go. Thanks. Yeah, I'll just go, okay? [ominous orchestral music] [tires squealing] [light orchestral music] - Will you be able to fix 'em like they were? - Of course, Sally. They're dead, are they not? - Can I ask you a question, Mr. Sumatra? - Go ahead, Sally. - How come you shot that guy when you opened the door? - [laughs] There's an old Haitian proverb. When the Tonton Macoute comes knocking, don't answer the door. [laughs] [light orchestral music] Now, the real work begins. [whimsical music] [muffled grunting] - Bye, Vinnie. Too bad things didn't work out better. Hey, Mr. Sumatra, where'd Tommy go? - [Mr. Sumatra] There with the others. - They're just laying here. - They have completed their mission and now they sleep until needed again. You, Sally, as the new high priestess of the Badon will be their caretaker. They're yours to take. You now may begin your incantation. Top of page 79. - In the name of the most high duvalier. In the name of the most benevolent Haile Selassie. In the name of the Tonton Macoute, please heed this virgin who beseeches you for your blessing. [light orchestral music] [vocalizing] [light orchestral music] [wind whooshing] [eerie orchestral music] [vocalizing] [whimsical orchestral music] [vocalizing] [ethereal orchestral music] - [Mitzi] Would you like some coffee? - Yeah, sure. - There's this great place I know. We'll take a shortcut. [groaning] - Jesus, what's that? [Mitzi gasps] - Hello, Mitzi. [mumbling] [screaming]
