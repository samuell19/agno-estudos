So confusing. ♪ Ee Sogasada Sanje ♪ Hi Deepu! Did you entered with your right leg, correct? I anticipated a fabulous greeting. Come in soon. Just look at this house. -Wow! How amazing is this place! Doesn’t look like a rented house. It’s fully furnished. Yeah, the owner had planned it for himself. Unfortunately, he couldn't pay back the loan. [Giggles] I have been awaiting you, my love.

Do you think a woman is a banana ..to eat and toss off the peel? I’m not gonna spare you! [Evil laughter] Wait. You hang out with your futile friends each night at the club ..and come home so late. Don't you have any shame? Learn from your brother. He cares so much about his kids and family. Yeah, I’ve seen. You got me married to your wayward son. Please don't think so, my dear. I’m struggling here. It’s my fate. What fate? Am I not listening to you people? I visit the factory regularly. Sometimes when I’m worn out, I visit my companions in bars or clubs. Is that a big thing? You talk as though I'm fleeing with some lady. [Gasps] Thank god, you haven’t done that. He might have done that as well. He gets home late after 12 PM. What’s the assurance that he has no affair? Who knows where he goes ..and whom he spends time with? Don’t just blabber, you idiot! You please calm down. A woman must have abundant patience. [Yells] What are you up to? You always keep on playing. Now you’re operating a small car, later when you grow up, buy a bigger car ..and kill someone on the road. What’s wrong with you dad? He’s a kid. Why do you talk ill about him? You have no sense, and you're lecturing me? He's become just like you. It's obvious for my son to have my qualities. Not your's! If you had any of my characteristics, this family would be running great. [Sobbing] What happened, Abhi? Grandpa scolded me. He's always harsh on me. That’s it, huh? Grandpa never scolds you. Abhi, he scolds me too. But I don’t weep like you. What do you do then? I can’t reveal it. Please tell me. Because I don't want him to be harsh on me. Okay, I shall tell you. But, you shouldn't tell to anybody. Alright. I know a magic trick! Really? Whenever he scolds me, I disappear and go hit him. Why do you think Granddad always gets neck aches? Don't know. Do you think I’ll be quiet if he scolds? Teach me this trick. Sure, I will. But don't say this to anyone. Done. Now you'll disappear.. It's gonna work only for 10 minutes. Where are you Abhi? Bro, I’m right here. No, you’re not. [Surprised] Remember, the trick works only for 10 minutes. Do whatever you want to, right now! Okay, brother. At least now you need to learn. Never make a woman cry. It's not a good omen for you and this house too. Alright. Why are you hitting my dad? -Am I visible now? -Are you out of your mind? You’re going to get trashed now. Dad, what happened? Just how the bird isn't responsible for the ruptured twig.. Similarly, my son isn't responsible for your dad's demise. If you were sensible, we wouldn't have to get counseling for our only son in a hospital. Hey, mind it. Are you perfect? You always keep wandering to ..these gatherings, conventions, and parties. Have I ever questioned you? We wouldn't be here if you were rational. Oh, am I so imperfect? And what about you? Yes. You loaf around every day and return home so late. Is that good with you? If I do the same, it's unacceptable. Even my father never questioned me. Who are you to point at me? I’m done with you. Yeah, go away. Who can tolerate you? Just go away. Huh? Did you just ask me to go away? Yeah. Is this your final decision? Yes, final. Okay, I shall leave. Never show me your face too. I’m filing a divorce against you. Cigarette! [Phone ringing] Have you ever visited the pooja room? Ever prayed or lit a lamp there? Upma? Yes, it's upma. Even yesterday it was upma. And you repeated the same today as well? Yesterday it was coarse upma. Today, it's thick layered upma. Both are the same. Look, I'm not running an Udupi Bhavan hotel ..to maintain a menu card. You can employ chefs if you need that. Here, I do all the stuff from cooking, cleaning, and tending. What did I say now? You’ve been yelling like a Radio Jockey. Yes, I’m the jockey to this crazy family. But not a Radio Jockey.

[Festive drums playing] [Everybody cheering] You might be an old soul but, very youthful for your age. Oh! Wanna know how you are looking? Yeah, how am I looking? You look exactly like Ananth Nag when he was 25. -Uncle.. -Did you listen? Heroines might change from Lakshmi, Geetha to Ambika. But Ananth Nag will remain the same. -Young and energetic like you are -Yeah.. He’s Raghu, a baby with a beard. [Laughs] He’s my nephew. Namaskar! [Greeting each other] Grab some drinks and have fun. Uncle, you wanna have some? I’m the groom, no booze for me today! Look, Abhi is right there. You guys have fun. Oh! I’m very sorry, Abhi. What's up, Abhinandan? A fabulous ceremony for\ your dad’s third wedding. A perfect arrangement. The third wedding can’t be too basic. It’s obvious, isn’t it? Even then, your new mother from Kashmir looks stunning. Have you met her yet? Or shall I introduce you? Not sure if they’ve met yet. He is in anger. Sad.. Abhi is angry. Let’s get drunk. Why are you having a beer? Have this. Irritating fellow! [Storms out] Hey Abhi, come here. Chill! Get out of my way! Okay anyways, it's my uncle's wedding. Have it.. Cheers guys! Hi Abhi. Thank god, you are here. I assumed you wouldn't show up since you weren't picking any calls. Good that you came. Saved my face in front of everyone. What respect do you have to lose? What happened now? What more has to happen? Looks like you’re on a wedding binge. What more do you expect? A wife is the best thing that has happened to a man. What say, baby? -Yes, baby. If that’s so, why did you abandon mom? I couldn’t tolerate your mother at home. She fights over trivial things. I value peace of mind, isn't it baby? Hmm.. Feed all these lies to your new spouse, and not to your son. Parent's love must be like an investment, and not installment to the kids. 6 months here, and the rest over there. Please.. It's annoying! Okay, here's something. What? You were supposed to stay with me from the next week. [Hesitates] Don’t worry.. I’m referring to the shared custody. Yeah, I know. So what? Why wait a week? You come right now. Why? Try to understand. We’re planning a honeymoon to the Maldives. The weather's great. We are staying there for 15 days. You join us. I’ll make the bookings right away. Dad, what are you saying? It’s your third marriage and ..you’re still longing for a honeymoon. You don't speak sensibly. Abhi, listen to me. Wait.. Look, you go where ever you want. Just don't disturb me, let me be. [Gasps] Baby.. No, he wont join us. [Laughs] All right, what shall I buy for you in the Maldives? Seashells. Seashells? Conch Shells?

He’s extravagantly lavish, and you are reckless. My head’s going to explode now. Yeah, why not. Your head always explodes. Clarify this. Whom do you call out for when you are hurt? Mom or Dad? I shout out slang. With his company, you’ll throw slangs at me too. You’ll be with him the coming week. You won't remember at all. So, how’s your third mother? You’ve no control over your mouth ..and he has no control over his desires. I’ve become a football in between you two. I’m done with both of you. So? That person literally invited me to his honeymoon. You on the other hand, always fight with me day and night. You guys have no adoration for me. Six months here and the rest over there. I'm burnt out on living this paying guest life. Okay, let’s do this. I’ll rent a house. If you guys really love me, you both stay with me. Yeah, go away. Go wherever you want.

I don’t care, I won't rent it out to a bachelor. Look, your husband is calling you. Let’s scoot! -Idiots! Namaskara! We are looking to rent a house. I shall rent it out to bachelors. But non-vegetarians aren't allowed. You won't find any mess of the meat around. So relax! We won't allow non-vegetarians. You rent this house for vegetarians alone. What are you blabbering! Get out! Go get a life! Just go away. Did you like the house? Yes, I did. But, where’s the restroom? Where’s the toilet? We have a shared toilet. [In disgust] No need! What if it’s a shared toilet? Not everyone uses it simultaneously. Quit gabbing. Let's check out some other options. Do one thing. Change the board from TO-LET to TOILET, and make some money. Yeah spare some cash, I’ll build it right away. [Yelling] Why the hell should I? Let’s keep going. This is an amazing house. Suits your budget as well. Sir, please have a look. Please go.. Aren’t you coming? Today is an auspicious day of Guru Raghavendra! I won't climb any steps. You carry on. Okay. Carry on.. Have you informed him of everything? Yes, I have. He insisted on this house after knowing. Look, you take your money and I’ll take my share. Ramesh, any problem? Sir, no problem. He wants rent, electricity bill, water bill to be paid online. He doesn't accept cash. Such an honest guy. Okay, you can finalize this house. Sure, please pay the advance so you get the keys. Don’t forget my commission. Please.. Hey, it's Baby Boo.

Yeah sure. Look at him! He's following them like a train bogie. Call him. Let's mock! Ey! Come here. Me? Yeah.. What is it? I need to rush. I have work to do. Heard your parents went on a honeymoon. It seems, they called him too. But he didn't go. I I had joined them, it would be a family trip. She might be my father's third wife, but she's still my mom. Can't expect you to understand this. Idiot! Greetings everyone! Ey! -This is your princess Baby Boo.. -Who is she? Her name’s Bhoomika. She looks out for free spots like colleges and malls, and starts shooting videos. Look what I’m gonna do! Thank you so much.. Hi.. Hi.. My name's Raghu. I’m a big fan of yours. The moment my mother knows you study here, she might come here looking for you. [Blushes] Didn't I say that I attract family audience a lot? Okay tell me, so many people shoot videos, why do you like me? Bhoomika.. There might be thousand lights, but moonshine is priceless. A picture? Sure. This is good. -Yeah. You're an expert! [Laughing] Look at the camera. A lot of disturbance in the background. Unwanted materials! That's okay.. Boo, you’re really cute. Thank you. I shall leave. Tag me on Instagram. -Sure. It's Baby Boo. -Boo, I'll follow you. I’ll follow you. -Sure, thank you. Bye! [Irritated] Do you know her? Yes, I know her. You just know her, but I own her from now on. Look.. I’ve just started with small talks. I’ll end it with a blast. Keep watching. Wear this as well. Look properly. I’m your elder brother. So always, I'm first and you are the next. Okay? Bye. Baby Boo.. Tell me. Do you know something? What's that? I watched your recent reel video. Your kiss in "Coma Coma" song ..is so unimaginable. I can do anything for my fans. Okay, that’s fine. But you kissed that dwarf. Can I get a kiss like that? Anything for you Raghu. No! Is this dream?! Before it turns into reality, I need to propose to her. Ta dhang! [Humming] Abhi, I actually thought I would require two days. But considering her pace.. Her pace? One day was sufficient. [Blushing] I’ll take a leave. Who’s he? What are you doing? You think so much to die? Are you gonna jump now? Or shall I kick you down? [Panting] Let me in. You coward! Didn't I ask you to jump? Jump! [Laughing] [In fear] Woke up now? Who are you? Why have you come to my home? Go away from here. Hello.. Which is your house? It's my home. What? I was the first tenant to this house. Later you moved in. What are you saying? Oh, you require a detailed explanation. Keep looking at me. There's a flash behind you. I’m taking you to a flashback. Keep watching. Hey, Sunil.. Hey, look she’s here. She looks amazing, isn't it? ♪ You are like an angel from heaven ♪ ♪ Showering lightning bolts of love ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ This girl is just as pure as milk.

But, when he was told that hunting was illegal, he shot at the forest officer. Run away! Unfortunately, the forest officer died. That was a huge case. So they fled from their village overnight. And then they settled here with a provision store for a living. [Laughing] What do you want? Why are you signaling like a traffic cop? [Acting dumb] Oh, you can’t speak! -Hmm Can’t you say that loud? Okay, take it. [Denies] You don't need money? What else do you need? [Gestures] Oh, do you want to work? So you don’t need money! God snatched away your voice, but not your self-respect. [In Pride] Okay, what work do you know? Oh, you can’t speak. You can communicate in gestures. I’ll understand. [Starts gesturing] You would manage all the housekeeping work! [Signals] And also you’ll look after me really well? Oh, you look like a fine man. (Kharjura - pet name of Manja) Start working from today. Okay carry these bags. Let’s go home. Badami.. [Calls his daughter] Badami.. Dad, I'm coming. Help him put the bags down. Dad, who is this? He can’t speak. Can’t speak, is it? He approached me in our store seeking work. He seemed like a fine man, so brought him home. Hey Kharjura, she is my daughter. Ey! She is my daughter! Keep your eyes down.

Who will listen to your songs? Imagination. Come to the point! Okay, will stop. [Sign language] You look beautiful. Can you speak? I know lot more than just talking. What? I love you from bottom of my heart. Why did you act like you couldn’t talk? I was terrified by your father. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal for his love. This is the least I could do for my love. Consider this as a test assigned to me. Consider it as a proposal. You can choose between sugar candy and a betel leaf. If you agree, pick the candy. If not, chew the leaf and spit it on me. Okay not on me, spit it away. I never anticipated your presence in my life. [Blushing] I wish to lead a happy life with you. You’re the boon I‘ve received without any penance. God has blessed me with good fortune. I‘ll offer him sweets. What did you like about me? Your romantic eyes, chubby cheeks, luscious lips, it mesmerized me. Okay, let it be.. What did you like about me? Even though you knew that you wouldn't be alive, you still loved me. Why will I die? [Yelling angrily] You are in your briefs. Dad! You acted dumb, just to seek my daughter? Sir, it’s not my fault. Your daughter threatened to kill me if I don’t come. I'll shoot you down! Run..! Dad, don’t do this. Listen to me. [Gasps] Hey, go away.. Sir.. Sir, who are you? Is it your naming ceremony at this age? Or pre-wedding shoot? Sir, what’s all this? Who are you? [Laughs] I’m the Supreme being. Huh? Almighty! God, eh? [Laughs] Stop kidding. You fool! You worship countless versions of me. But you people don’t believe ..when I appear in front of you. You died in a car accident. What? Try to remember. Sunitha.. Sunitha.. Hello.. Can’t you guys see me? Where are the residents of this house? -Do you remember that old man Hunter Kannappa? -Hmm.. He tried to shoot his helper boy. What? Yeah, that poor guy lost his life ..colliding with a car when trying to escape. Is he a stray dog to bump into a car? In fear of getting arrested, the old man and his daughter ..fled the city overnight. Where did they go? Tell me where she went? Where did Sunitha go? Tell me.. Am I dead? Am I a wandering soul? Oh almighty! Sorry, I couldn't recognize you. I’m sorry. Haven’t I offered you my prayers, fasts, performed rituals and substantially more? Is it fair to take away my life? Is this fair? Picking stones from the rice bag is acceptable. But you've picked up the entire bag. You lustful moron! Do you have any common sense? Did I ask you to roam around on your briefs? Some vehicle came in. You crashed into it and died. What can I do about that? My situation was dire. What situation? The situation was caused by my true love. It's not true love, it's lust! [Denies] This is all because of your lust, excitement, and stupidity. You'll know only when someone chases you pointing a gun. You had the chance to live a life. You died because of the consequences of your own actions. Don’t be so judgmental. Now, are you going to take me away? I’m here to talk about that. Oh, dear lord. You can't just enter heaven like how you squander on Earth. There's a specific time, and one can get in only at that time. Until then, you cannot come there nor stay here, you’ll remain a wandering soul. You’ll be able to see everyone. When it’s your time, I shall call out for you. Please do come. Oh almighty! I need a boon from you. That I should see Sunitha. I need that boon. You just got blessed holding the sacred flute. Thank you, my dear lord! Give it back. -I'm blessed, my lord! You can choose a person who can see you. But there’s a twist here. If that person isn’t happy and utters the word ”bittaku" thrice, you won't be visible to anyone around. Think about it. Okay, I’m sure Sunitha will never ask me to leave. We shall meet again. Again? Yeah, need to take you back. Sure.. Let's see.. You play the flute really well. Can you play it again? Okay, why did you choose me instead of her? I begged for this boon so she could see me. It’s been so many years, I covered each and every inch of Karnataka. Couldn’t find her anywhere. I just wish well for her, wherever she is. What else do I do? My offer stays valid for the next 6 months only. It would get wasted. I’m observing you for two days. I feel pity for you. That's why I choose you. Thanks. That’s okay, how can you help me? You’re a cute guy. That’s okay, how can you help me? You’re a cute guy. You don’t seem to have any foul habits. But, the only thing you lack is confidence. You have no confidence, that's the problem. You attempted suicide just because of that girl. Are you out of your mind? I’ll help you impress her. I didn't have a single penny, I still impressed my girl. You have to agree to this. Why another? That's okay, have one more. Look, the one distributing sweets, she's my girl. Bhoomika aka Baby Boo. What's the occasion? Father’s day! She looks alluring! A lifetime isn't enough to spend with her. A couple of lifetimes might be needed for sure. Don't say such things, she's my girl. Huh? You're a lucky fellow. My father is my hero and my inspiration. What does he do? He’s a self-made scientist. But he’s not with us. Why? [Drone propelling in Indo-Pak border] After continuous efforts, finally I made it fly. I made it fly..! Does it fly? It can fly across the border. Across the border? I don’t think so. When something great is being accomplished, people doubt a lot more than cheering. Nonsense! [Person mocks] Let me show you. You crossed the border, flying that kite? It's not a kite. It's a drone. I’m a self-made scientist. Let me go.. So where is your dad now? He is imprisoned in Pakistan. Steadfast as a solitary snake among a large number of mongoose. Her dad crossed the border and got caught. And you're here with nothing! If you want that girl, you must initially dazzle at least four girls. I’ll train you for that. Four girls? Yes, let’s train. You'll definitely impress her. Let's take it as challenge! "Raatri Rahasya!" (Title of an adult movie) "Yelakki Baale Hannu" (Title of an adult movie) "Mysuru Mallige" (Title of an adult movie) What’s all this? Education opens the eyes of society, where as sex education ..expanses knowledge of the universe. That’s okay, but there’s no rating or reviews for these. There are no ratings for these. Just watch and enjoy. I’ve already seen this in my teenage. Are these even movies? There are around nine movies with the same title. Patience is a virtue, just watch it! [Shocked] A person must have confidence. One can achieve anything with confidence. You have very low confidence. Would you get confidence wearing colorful garments, shoes, and with different hairdos? No! An impression will be made. Confidence is something within you. Wake up the Romeo inside you. Just go to her and talk. Look.. How would you feel if someone's staring at you for long? I feel disgusted. Correct! Similarly girls dislike someone staring at them for long. You really need to go there and speak. Just talk. Stalking is bad! Look, there! I don’t feel this is right. What if my girl feels bad? Look, I know how this works. Won't you listen to my words? At any cost, don’t look at you girl. Maintain eye contact. Yo! [Cheers] Hi, I’m Abhi. And you are? I’m Rashmi. Hi Rashmi, can I buy you a drink? But why? Well, there’s a lot to talk about. I don’t want your lips to go dry. -Okay. -Bro, a glass of wine, please.. Sure sir. -Come, let's go! -What happened? -I'll tell you later. -Where are we heading? Come, I'll tell you. At least this time, impress the girl. Do something! What does it mean? Why do think I showed you those movies? So that you do something! Since you made me watch that, I spoke to her. That is all I can do. We need perfection, else you’ll get rejected. All I can do is friendship. Nothing more than that. Seems like you are enjoying this more than me. [Giggling] Lightly..! [Giggles] My dear kiddo! Pointless if you sit here, all dressed up. You need to socialize and begin intriguing girls out there! I asked you to impress four girls. Three is an odd number. Make it even. Look, all this is old school. We are the young generation. We make kids over the phone now. Out! [Bell rings] Home delivery! If you’re done impressing over the phone, try impressing her directly. Do something manly. Just go away. [Giggling] Do whatever you want! Hey, you won! You naughty! I asked you to find girls, not this old man. Let’s find my girl. What use is this coma patient for us? Is he in a coma? Can someone go to coma in this expression? Who is he? He’s our house owner. Do you mean our owner? He’s a role model to all the house owners. Never asked rent. The same expression always. Students, let’s examine the next patient. He’s been in a stage of coma for 20 years. Look.. He doesn’t respond to bright light or pricks. You're done with the training. Now start impressing your girl. It's time. -Let me prick again. -Face new challenges! After all that pointless training, now you’re asking me to go talk to her. How is that possible? Okay let’s move to the next patient. [Snaps fingers] [Screams] Sir..! What happened? Sir, he called out for me. He winked too, didn’t he? Yeah, how did you know that? You’ve been frantically shooting videos everywhere, and think everyone around is your fan. -Sir, please listen to me -This patient is in a coma for 20 years. No.. Calm down and let's move to the next! Don’t talk rubbish. The next visit is to a dead body. She might say it got a re-birth. He is in a deep coma. It’s impossible. I swear on you. He winked at me. Called out, and held my hand too. Let me see. Yes, I did see him call you out. Look, he has seen it. Why don’t you believe me?! He is in a deep coma for 20 years. How is it possible? You dumbo! You won’t get it. Yeah, how is that possible? That’s because of reflex. Oh, reflex huh? Yes, sometimes even a scrap guitar plays spontaneously. Even a ceased clock rings it's bell. You are really great! Why so? You got in energy reflex into a coma patient. You foxy! What could you possibly do to youngsters like us? Thank you.. What’s your name? I’m Abhi. I’m Bhoomika. I know very well. Baby Boo.. What happened? I have a pain in my leg. -Excuse me. Hi ma'am. Please move aside. Can I take a selfie? -Shall I? -Hmm.. Can you click one for me?

Even though my body hurts due to the fight with my brother, but I still feel real happy, Manjanna. You’ve got her now. You’ll be on cloud nine from now on. It’s all because of your blessings. May you get hitched soon. Manjanna, why were you driving away all the tenants? I never tortured anyone. I observe them for two days, so that I could show myself. By then, they would escape out of fear. so that I could show myself. By then, they would escape out of fear. Why so? There’s a small flashback. Another flashback huh? Look there. Hello, namaste! I’m Manjunath. I’m an old occupant of this house. I’ve been so bored off late ..staying here alone. Now that you’re here. I can talk to you. What an irresponsible person! Left the tap open, in-spite of water crisis at it's peak. Learn from the farmers ..on how to utilize water. [Bell rings] Coming! Did I stop it? It's so confusing. He went to attend the door and ..forgot to turn this lights off as well. Hi Deepu! You entered with your right leg, correct? I anticipated a fabulous greeting. Just look at this house. Wow! How amazing is this place?! You lusty idiot! Do you expect a traditional entry? It’s fully furnished. Oh, you want to date her.. You scoundrel! I’m not bothered. Do as you wish. I'm not gonna do this. [Indistinct chatters] ♪ Tum Paas Aayee ♪ (Song from the movie "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai") [Humming continues] You moron! How dare you to stop a Kannada movie? See, what I'm gonna do to you! You traitor! [Screams] Hey! [Wicked laugh] It’s Baby Boo. Carry on. Hi Baby Boo. What are you doing? I was awaiting your call. Why? I had planned a romantic proposal yesterday. I couldn't, because of the fight. I want to take you to an exceptional place. Oh! Will you take me to any place that I wish to? Obviously! Then, I’ll share a location with you. Tomorrow you have to be there. There’s a big surprise for you. Sure, Baby Boo. Why did you stop? Let’s go in! What happened? There are a lot of ghosts troubling gods in temples, questioning on why they were made that way? So god came up with some strict rules. Saying evils aren’t supposed to visit him. So I'm following that. You carry on.. Okay, wait near this piller. I’ll meet my girl and will be back. Careful! Don’t defile this holy place. Done seeking the blessings? And meeting the goddess too? Are you happy now? You didn't say much about yourself. Whom do you reside with? I stay alone. Oh Sorry, are you an orphan? Nope.. My parents got divorced when I was young. My dad recently got married for the third time. I didn’t want to shift here and there every six months. So I stay alone separately. Even if they are separated, they never had another child. Not necessary they must adore you with kisses and hugs. I don't even know how my dad looks. At least you’ve got them. You need to stay happy. I told you about a surprise, do you remember? You never asked about it. What’s the surprise? Today my entire family is here. I wanted to introduce them to you. How’s the surprise? -Superb idea! Come let's go. -Yeah. Godambi.. (Pet name of Bhoomika) Hi Grandpa! [Sighs] Who are you? How dare you hug my daughter? I’ll shoot you. Grandpa relax, why are you yelling? Look Godambi.. How dare he hug Badami? (Pet name of Sunitha) Who are you? She's Sunitha! [Excited] Who are you? She's Sunitha! [Excited] He's an aggrieved old man. Don’t tell him you’re her boyfriend. He’ll shoot you down. Bluff something and escape. Else he'll shoot you! Who are you? -I’m a fan. -What? That doesn’t mean you can hug my daughter? I’ll shoot you. Dad please, can you lower your gun? Poor guy is terrified. I'm backing down because of you. Dear Godambi, is he your fan? Yes grandpa, he is my fan. Okay, let this go. I just got excited about meeting you all. So I gave a tight hug. Please forgive me. Okay fine. Even a fan must not cross the limits. Let’s leave. We shouldn't be lenient. You don’t feel bad. What happened? The old man killed me and got her hitched to someone else. Look at her, so content with kids and family. Maintaining her physique with diet and makeovers. She doesn’t remember me. She has forgotten me. What’s wrong with you now? Your love story will change to a revenge story! Just watch! What I’ll do! ♪ Preethi Maadu Thappenilla ♪ (A song from the movie "Halli Meshtru") [Song continues] Oh dear, Baby Boo! Master, what's this? Looking at your pace, thought the old man would be dead by now. Yeah, just when I was about to.. My girl was.. What? Which girl? My love, Sunitha hasn’t aged a bit. She’s the same. At the point when I was about to choke her, she smirked like a baby. I was delighted to look at that. I just sat there looking at her. I was mesmerized. Manjanna, aren't you ashamed to pry on others' wives? It wasn’t lustful, it was out of love. She might be someone’s wife now. But she was my lover back then. Understood? Why this attire? What’s up with you? I was very inspired by your flashback story. That’s why I’m here as a pizza delivery guy. Also wanted to tell her about you and ..that whole love training stuff. Please don't do that. As per the boon, I should be visible to you alone. In case you tell her about me, I can never see Sunitha again. Please, don’t tell anyone. Master, I can’t jeopardize my love story to save yours. Please.. -I can’t.. -Please.. Don’t you understand? -Please.. Whom are you speaking to? No one. I was rehearsing the best way to convince you. Why are you unhappy? What did I do? Tell it on my face if you aren't interested. Don’t just pretend. Grandpa had a heart issue because of you. You prick with your words, while your grandpa with his gun. Don’t touch me. I thought acquainting you with them may help our future. But what did you do? You haven’t hugged me even once. How dare you hug my mom? Upon that, you lied about being my fan. I hate you. Just get out. I was terrified with his gun pointing at me. That’s why I lied. Abhi, shut up! I’ve seen all your flirtatious chronicles. You have numerous girls on your contact list. Look, what you saw was real, yet they’re just my friends. Oh, friends huh? What kind of friends? You girls make guys work for your necessities, and quickly friend zone them once they develop feelings. If a guy does the same, then he's tagged characterless and a flirt! Yes, I did move around with those girls. I don’t have any feelings for them. If I had, why would I put up with your grandpa? Or come here like a pizza delivery guy? After all this, I’m still behind you, so understand my adoration for you. Godambi.. How dare you come here? I’m just here to deliver the pizza. I didn’t know you stay here. You were a fan before, now a delivery guy. What’s happening? Grandpa, it's not like that. I didn't cooked up these stories. Grandpa, don’t worry. He’s just my fan. Is there anything left to deliver? No.. Then leave! Yeah, slow and steady.. -Hi Grandpa.. -What are you doing here? Are you here to deliver that coat? No, I work here. Oh, are you a compounder? No, I'm a doctor here. At first he was a fan, later a delivery guy ..and now a compounder. -Grandpa, please come. How many roles does he play! We need to get you scanned. Please change to this gown. Changing room is that way. -Okay.. Hey nurse, come here. No, I’m not of that kind! Same here. Just come here for a minute. No, I've my marriage fixed down the line. Grandpa, what are you up to? It’ll be an issue. Not up to anything bad. I can’t find my dress. That’s why I called you. Oh is it, everything’s right there! You are so mischievous. You're so naughty! How did it appear now? Grandpa, I got tensed seeing you in your briefs. Just go in and get it changed. No, it wasn’t there before. -Please go.. [Evil Laughter] Anger, revenge and hatred! He made me run on my briefs. I did the same. Even revenge needs to have some standards. This is so lame. Is it? Then, I'll make him walk around without briefs. Nobody can look. -You are sick! It’s your fate, so let it be. Whom are you speaking to? No one. It’s useless talking to you. Do whatever you want. Baby Boo.. Please listen to me. Baby Boo.. Stop! Your grandpa just popped out of nowhere today. So I couldn’t speak to you. No Abhi, you’ve changed. Earlier you waited for me consistently in college. Even organized a film set to shoot videos as well. You protected me when someone taunted me. You've been so occupied since you proposed to me. Nothing as such. You don't have time to talk to me. But you'll be busy talking to yourself. I don’t think you like me anymore. It's nothing like the way you think. I was so involved in considering ways of persuading your family. Couldn’t spare time for you. It won’t happen again. I’m sorry. Okay, I’m sorry too. I rushed you to meet my family. Don’t worry. We’ll make this happen together. Okay, Baby Boo. What are you looking at? We’re good now. Give me a hug! What, here? Yeah.. In the hospital? Yes.. Hey, Alugadde Samosa..! (Pet name of Abhi) You were pretending to be a fan, a delivery boy, and a compounder for this? I'm so raged up! I wanna shoot you down! Tragically, I don't have my gun now. Godambi, what’s all this? I was waiting for the perfect opportunity to admit our love. Sorry.. Do you love him? -Yes.. I’m not as bad as u think. Don’t even utter a word! You are flirting with her. I’ll shoot you down! How dare you? Why are you shouting? This is a hospital. We’ve just got you scanned now. At least stay alive till the reports arrive. -[Gasps] -[Sighs] Sorry, please stay calm. If I stay calm, he'll impregnate your daughter. Dad! What are you blabbering? I don’t care. He's hugging her in public. What will people think? Look, we’ll visit your house tomorrow. Let’s talk to your parents and get you both hitched. Is it okay? Badami, do you agree to this? Mom, please.. As you say, dad. Why would I deny it? Badami.. Who here is the first and third wife? Dad, please. Keep quiet. -Okay. Is this your own bungalow? Yeah, it is. I have a couple of bungalows, I have kept them for weekend getaways. Consider this as your place. As you wish. Dad, do face this side as well and talk. Now, you are all aware of the ongoing romantic tale. Yes. We must get them married at the right age. Else, they might slip away. They have to be controlled. -Yes. -We have to! Here, even elders are prone to make blunders! Yes, it's evident. Let me get some tea. -Serve it hot! Quick. -[Mocks] Now.. We have agreed to get her married to your son. We too have no objections. Okay? Godambi, what do you say? Grandpa, I need to talk to Abhi in private. Look, your dad’s eyes are gazing at Sunitha behind those glasses. If this continues, I’ll possess him ..and drown him in the pool. We shall discuss the formalities, get their engagement done and followed by marriage. There are no formalities. We are glad to get your girl hitched to our son. I have few conditions if you were to marry me. You need to agree to that. What’s that? My man must ride a white horse to the wedding like a prince. [Horse neighing] But I can’t ride a horse. Learn how to.. You decide on an auspicious date. I’ll handle all the arrangements. By all means.. Let him handle the arrangements. He’s an expert handling wedding arrangements. Right from catering to decorations, he’s got them all on speed dial. If they both keep wandering this way, people might take lenience and talk awful. -So, it’s good to get them married soon. -Correct. What say? I'm okay with any decisions taken by her. Come here.. You were lecturing me on prying at other's wives. Check out your playboy father. Staring like a dog looking at the bone. If he doesn’t stop now, I’ll teach him a lesson. What? You're focused just here.. Grandpa.. My dad has a sprained neck. Oh is it? -I thought he is squint. -Yes, last night I had a sprain in the neck. Look, my family takes a lot of pride in regard and respect. Aware of my son-in-law? He was serving in border.. Yeah, I’m aware. He built a drone out of waste and it flew ..across the border to Pakistan. That’s the one, right? Yeah. I know it too.. Oh! I'm aware too.. Oh! -Me too.. -Oh! Even I'm aware. I also know. Godambi, everyone here knows about you father. Great! -How's that! -So cute! Please have some tea. Don’t pick it. Put it back. But I want it. Just put it back! Please take it. Who the heck are you? Go away! Thank you. -Masala tea? -Yes. -Please, have it. -Thank you. Have it.. Hello, why don't you have some tea? Nope.. I’ll just have dry fruits. The key to my strength! Even in this age..! Please have some. Dry fruits? Hoping for good! We’ll let you know about the date. Let’s go. Are you leaving? I’ll call you. Seek their blessings. No, that’s okay. Have this. No, I don’t eat it. She’s fit and healthy. No thanks. Are you on WhatsApp? Nope. -Grandpa.. -God bless you, my dear. [Sighs] Abhi.. Abhi.. What happened? -What’s wrong with you? -Let it go. Seems Abhi is excited about the marriage. Even I thought the same. What’s up with you? Why are you behaving like your dad? Okay. Let’s leave.. Let me drop you in my car. Is this the car? Don't hesitate, it’s my dad’s favorite car. He only offers it to people he likes. You are denying to discuss the dowry formalities, that’s so kind of you. But we insist, you accept gifts from our end. He’s your son-in-law, feel free to gift him. -Sure. -Okay then.. Scrap this junk! Let me get you a luxurious car. Car huh? Gift anything, except a car. Please, don’t reject it. Of course, can’t deny when it comes from you. A driver along with the car would be helpful. What's all this? Will anyone demand driver along a car as dowry? What kind of a strange request is this? Your son drives a car well. Indeed he does! When he was a kid, he has driven many big cars sitting on my lap. Then why are you requesting for a driver? The thing is.. One day he was driving while sitting on my lap. Some insane guy wearing briefs bumped into us and died. Since then, he doesn’t drive. Oh, is it? Oh, you sinners! Who all killed me are now trying to become a family? How have I wronged you all? Sunitha.. [Sobs] Doing injustice to the soul is equal to doing injustice to god. Listen, I have done no wrong to anyone. You killed me unjustly. I’m so dumb, being a guiding beacon ..to the one who put me off. Standing by you even when you are actually guilty. What have I done now? You’re a killer. Take your words back. You dug your own grave. So I'm not responsible for that. Don’t talk like a KEB lineman. How dare you? A small kid still nibbling his thumb, riding a car without a license. Isn’t that wrong? Boss, who asked you to run into the middle of the road? I'm so agitated right now! Feel like possessing you and jumping off this building. [Bell rings] Let's go inside.. Is there anyone else in the house? Nope. Who are you? Listen, Sunitha.. It wasn’t he who hugged you. I had possessed him. One moment.. She’s locking the door. You youngsters don’t spare anyone! Dear god, did you leave me here to witness all these? One moment, please come. Stop holding her hand! Be careful. Any specific reason that you're here at this time? Wanted to talk about incident which happened in the morning. I’ll tell you what happened! Everyone who killed me are trying to become a family. I hugged you by mistake. No, I haven't misunderstood that. Yeah, you’re here at this time, obviously you wouldn't mind. It’s true that you hugged me. However, it felt like a hug from someone who I truly loved. I didn’t get you. I need to confess something. I was mesmerized for a moment when you hugged me. Later, I realized that made me remember my love back then. Confession about someone you love? Look, Abhi.. Truth must be the foundation of any new relationship. I don’t want to deceive you with lies. I loved someone when I was young. He truly loved me as well. We were inseparable. In a strong belief that we would get hitched, we had crossed the limit. His name was Manjunath. But fate had other plans. He passed away as a result of my dad’s outrage. He died in front of my own eyes. When you hugged me this morning, I felt like it was him. Manjunath? I didn't get you. He passed away. But.. But his love had sprouted in my womb. Bhoomika is his daughter. She looks alluring! Then what about the story of drone? I wanted to confess this many times. Yet, my father made up a story and topped off her mind. Repeating the same lie numerous times made it real. Our family is not brimming with reputation, pride, or honour. I wanted to convey this to you. It’s not a big deal. We aren’t a royal family too. Every family has it's own history and mysteries. Does that mean you’re fine with marrying my daughter? There’s no way this marriage is going to be canceled. By the way, why would I cancel it? You’ve just gained my respect considerably more at this point. You have a good heart. I feel relieved now after sharing this with you. I shall leave now. Okay. Bhoomika is my little girl! Uncle! Father-in-law! [Agitated] Stop it. Who is your father-in-law? Don’t call me that. Manjanna, I'm calling you. You’re my father-in-law, aren’t you? No, don’t say that. My daughter is an angel. I'll never get her married to you. This is not your dialogue at all. You’re already dead. Abhi, don’t trigger me. Stop it! Why have you switched sides now? I haven’t turned. Just forget my daughter. Why would I forget her? Is that a social media password? Are you all even a family? Your dad lures around marrying every other woman. Your mom, so talkative. Always picks a fight. And you here are a coward. You even attempted suicide. I would’ve stayed happy with her. You people ran a car over and killed me. Can’t let my daughter marry you. Better, you cancel it. There is no chance I'll let this happen. Are you perfect? You made me impress four girls for the sake of training. Is it fair if it is with others? But unfair if it happens to you. What an amazing logic! Abhi, you’re crossing your limits. She is the gift of my sacred love. Not a gift, it’s a curse! You impregnated her before marrying her. She’s lying to everyone about her dad’s story . No, Abhi.. Look, this is your final warning. Look, there’s no way I’m canceling it. Do whatever you can. Uncle, stop this! Enough of your tricks. No! You aren't canceling it? Nope, I won't. Uncle, don't do this to me. Where have you brought me? I'll say "Bittaku" thrice. [Weird laughs] [Panting in fear] No..! No..! Godambi, there’s something fishy here. I couldn’t sleep the entire night. My own gun was pointed at me. For sure, there’s something paranormal here. Dad, it’s a new place. It’s usual to feel this. Take this. Don’t scare her by saying all these. Badami, listen to me. (Pet name of Sunitha) For sure there’s something unusual here. For every sin you committed, witness how your gun moves tonight. Grandpa, you're correct. Certainly there’s something here. Bhoomi told me that you were frightened. I’ve got something to drive it away. Tie this yantra, and the ghosts shall stay away from you. Is it? Will it drive them away? I’m very much sure. Please get it tied. Okay, let me take one. Help me tie it. Grandpa, let’s take a selfie. You please step back. I'll stand in front. Okay, #twinningwithholythread. (Hash tag) Not a holy thread, even god can’t stop me. Hey, this is your last chance. Last chance! Oh,is it? Cancel the marriage. -Is it? -Yes. If not? [Mocking] Once more! Your trick isn’t working, right? My game has just begun. My game has just begun. Keep watching! Keep watching! ♪ Ninnantha Appa illa ♪ Baby Boo.. (Dr. Rajkumar's song from "Devatha Manushya") [Song playing in the background] Thank god! Uncle isn't here. You and your dad are tormenting me this way? I’ll not spare your dad too. Uncle.. Uncle.. Please don't mind. Don’t ever call me uncle! Yes, mom. It's urgent, can you come home? What happened? Dad? I broke up. [Sobs] Break up? The woman I loved, has kicked me out. I never get anything I love. Even your third wife kicked you out? At least now, did you realize? No one can tolerate this man. Mom, keep quiet. Why is your face swollen? Does it look like swollen? Yeah. I just returned home after partying with friends. She started a fight for not taking her along. By the time I could convince her, her relatives trashed me. [Sobs] I've helped them out at every point. She still drove me out of the house. Cheating! Everyone’s a cheat. Let’s go. Where? Come.. Please, don't do that! Padmaja, you talk some sense at least. Open the door. You can’t go in. Abhi, come here. He’s blabbering something. Translate it for me. Call my wife, I need to speak with her. Call my wife. Whose wife? Call his wife. Call her out. She can’t come out now. She’s busy. What did he say? Seems she is busy and can’t come out. I know something. She’s my wife and this is my house. Who are you to permit us? I’ll talk even if you deny it. Call her out! What is this "budda" (old man) saying? "Budda", eh? How dare you call me "budda"? Your dad is a "budda". I’ll punch on you face! Get out from here! What are you looking at? Wait here for sometime. I’ll teach them a lesson. Take care.. Guys, catch hold of him! So now you can speak Kannada? Bless me, grandpa! Some action is up there too. Keep walking. Will you ditch me? I was scared of losing my dad’s house to her. Girls always cheat. Cheating! What’s the point of spilling tears now? You never valued any relationship. You changed relationships like clothes. You must be preaching to me at this age, instead it's the other way. At least change yourself now. Astrology, black magic, rituals.. [Advertisement playing on TV] Why you staring at me? Nothing, chuck it. Let go? You avenged my dad, is my mom next in the line? Oh, you realized that it was me? Yes, so what? So what? Are you even a family? You, your dad, and mom are split up. In-between all this, you want to marry my daughter? I can never agree to that. There’s always problems within a family, doesn't mean you push everyone away. Everything will be fine sooner or later. What then? I don’t believe. Whatever it may be, you’re not marrying her. I don't need you. Go away! I don’t believe you. For problems with black magic, evil spirits or hypnosis, immediately contact Shri. Mangoli Baba. Get rid of all your problems by reaching out to Babaji. Babaji, please come. Who is this? He looks like a street merchant with Rudrakshi & Saligrama. Who is he? Babaji, there’s a ghost in here. I can see it. I can see him. Can you see me? Yes. Is he visible to you? Where did you come from? I hail from Mongolia, from behind mount Kailasa. I told I’d meet you soon. Meet me? How is Sunitha? Surprised? What’s all this, my lord? You have changed your outfit. I have thousand of forms. This is one among them. Is this fair? You granted me a boon. Within no time, I met Sunitha. Later, you set a validity for that. By then, I met my daughter. Leave that, his family ran the car over and killed me. And you’re making me a part of this alliance. Is this fair? All this is a part of my creation. It’s my handiwork. There's mystery too. And this is as a result of your deeds. What do I do? Okay chuck that! What’s your plan now? The boy is smart and the girl likes him too. I’m here to get them hitched and unite them as family. That’s the conflict here. At no cost, I’ll let that happen. Babaji, his arrogance hasn’t descended a bit. Yes. Remain silent! I too have the privilege to make this decision. Am I not her father? You relinquished the relations of father, mother, loved ones, friends, family, and worldly pleasures. Even your body. Manja, but why are you clinging on to your arrogance ..and tormenting this guy? I don’t agree to this alliance. I have very little time. Yes, Babaji. Change of plans. Let's move forward. Why are you here spinning around? What’s the plan? [Chanting] Here you go. Don’t let him out. Sure, Babaji. I'll get him after the expiry of his validity. I can’t tolerate individuals torturing anyone. I’ll hunt them down. So many people have pinged me. You’ll be happy to know the reason I’m live today. You already know how private I’m about my personal life. But, today I’d like to share something significant. He's my fiance! Face the camera.. Enough.. Okay, leave. We’re getting married soon. And I’ll mention the date in my bio. Bye.. Here’s an invite to my wedding. You must be present there for three days. Sure. Congratulations! Thanks Bhushan. He looked depressed after looking at the invitation. I feel pity for him. I’ll not pay you a penny. Take it back. Else I’ll shoot you. Stop it. What’s the issue? Look at this horse owner.. We requested for a white horse. But he’s got a brown one. Many weddings are happening. All of a sudden, how can I get a white horse? Don’t utter a word, I’ll shoot you! Why are you always threatening to shoot everyone? What’s the big deal if it’s brown or white? What matters is the horse. Ride on it! [Gasps] Hi.. Why are you crying? It's not tears of sorrow, it's tears of joy. Joyful flowers! It’s not flowers, it's tears. Yes, the same. Hey, it's Baby Boo. Hi Abhi. Hi Baby Boo. How do I look? Wow! You look handsome! Hi.. Is the horse ready? Just like you wanted it. Keep watching.. The best medicine to wash away my sorrow. How’s the attire? It fits so well. Super cool attire! Okay, I’ll see you soon. Bye.. [Festive drums playing] Come here. Are all the arrangements in place? Take this. Get some crackers & fireworks. Okay, sir. I'll get it. Let me give it one last try. Come.. You look really beautiful. Thanks mom. Look, my son is here. Riding the horse. It’s empty. It’s true that the witch never stops haunting. You trapped me in a bottle.. Try restraining the horse, if you really can! Why would I control the horse? [Horse neighing] [Horse neighing] Did you trap me in a bottle!? The game is on! Keep watching. Stop! Make way! Watch out guys! [Indistinct warnings] Run away..! [Mob dispersing in fear] [Horse neighing] Uncle, please stop this. The horse is here.. Lower your gun old man. Yeah! [Celebrated cheers] Just missed the shot. I'm enjoying this! Are you okay? What did you miss? You shot at a close range and still missed. You’ve been acting crazy since morning. What if the bullet hit my son? Don’t you have any sense? Ey! Dad! I asked for a white horse. But you’ve got a brown horse. It had to be shot down. -Grandpa, stay calm. Uncle, you please tell him. Dad, please. Keep quiet. No..! Look at him.. Could everyone keep silent? What are you up to? Don’t you have any sense? Why do you listen to everyone around you? Why are you behaving like your dad? He also goes crazy upon seeing any women. I don’t listen to anyone. I’m the horse. I don't need any comparision. Did you listen? He’s calling himself a horse. I warned you not to pursue it further with this family. There’s something wrong with this family. [Arguments in the background] What’s the problem? -What problem? -Don’t you have any issues? Keep quiet! You and your wife are divorced. -And you're on a wedding binge. -Hey! Your third wife has abandoned you. What if your son abandons my granddaughter? Whom should we rely upon? Like father, like son! This day wouldn't have come if my husband was perfect. Have you seen enough? Do you still need this marriage? Look, how crazy this old chap's talks are! Hey, who's old chap? Please, stay calm. I’m the Hunter Kannapa. Stop yelling dad, please. You expect us to stay here even after all these? Just get up son. Get up! Not required. You relax dear, I’ll find you another guy. Just call it off! [Indistinct arguments] Everyone. please stop! Who decided to cancel this marriage? Did anyone consult with me? Just because you're married thrice, do I need to? Mom, you need to calm me down. Whereas it’s the other way round here. You quarrel with everyone around you, resulting in you staying alone at home. I’ve never had a happy family since I was a kid. Grandpa, as a result of your outrage, both your daughter and granddaughter are suffering. What do you mean? What did I do? I’ve done everything right. Can you tell this in your daughter's face? Abhi, please. Abhi, what are you saying? Your dad's story about being in a jail is a lie. I did not have an option. If I had told you about this, would you still be this happy with grandpa? You’re his only symbol of my love. But the society cannot accept this. They’ll taunt about the kid being born before marriage. Yes I lied, but I was helpless. Your happiness contemplating your dad being alive.. So this lie didn’t seem huge. Your mother suffered her entire life because of my mistake. I never permitted her to come clean. No other intentions. Godambi, please forgive me. Forgive me for being rude. You too, please forgive me. What are your thoughts about the marriage? We agree to this. Are you happy? How come you know this secret? Abhi.. Tell them, I’m alive. Please.. But you aren’t alive. Do you want me to wander around forlorn? Please, tell them. You tried to stop this marriage. Now, that everyone has agreed. I’ll wait for the right time to tell them. What are you talking about with the horse? I’m again suspicious about this. You won’t torture me again, right? After all this why would I? Are you sure? Look, my dear.. You can marry my daughter. Tell them that I’m here. There’s a flashback story I need to share. What’s that? His Spirit! Spirit?! [Everyone] Is he here? Yeah, he is. Only I can see him. Hey, Aloogadde Samosa.. How long do you want to talk with spirit of Kharjura? Now that we are together as a Family Pack.. Let’s finish up the formalities. [Subs by KNJ Captions]
