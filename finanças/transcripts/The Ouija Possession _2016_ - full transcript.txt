(dreary music) (wind) (breathing heavily) (dreary music) (thunder) (breathing heavily) (whispering voices) - This isn't funny, you guys. (deep winds) (demonic squealing) Stop it. Stop it! (growling) (intense music) (scream) (whispering voices) Jesus! God. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! (organ) Guys? Lydia. Lydia. (laughing) (echoed deeper voice laughing) (thunder) (wind) (tempered piano) - [Tony] Oh, I'm so scared! So scared! - [Lydia] The saddest part was how sad the downs kid looked. Remember when asshole Mr. Thompson ripped their hands apart? Did you see how confused they looked? - [Barbara] I know. It's not like they had the capacity to know what they were doing. - [Woman] Like their whole world was crashing down around them. - Woo! Bring it up, Francis. Come on, buddy. - Hike. - Lateral, lateral. - Get him! Yeah! - All right, all right, all right. One completion. Keep it going, keep it going. Not happening again, not happening again. - You know I'm your supreme confidant in all things. You know you can tell me anything, right? - I'm so sick of Francis. - Is that why you haven't been talking much about you guys lately? - There's nothing to talk about. I mean, we're together every waking hour. I just sort of run out of things for us to talk about us. That's all. - Well, you just really haven't been saying that much, lately. You know, not like you used to. You know you can tell me. - Tell you what? - You know. - No. I mean, I don't know. What have you been hearing? - Girl, I don't need to hear. I can tell, just by the way you're sick of him. - Hike. - One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi. Get him! - Oh, come on! - Oh! - Never mind the bullshit, all right. Game's not over, not by a long shot. - Yeah. - Just stay positive. We're gonna win this game, all right? Okay, what I want you to do is I want you to throw that ball straight up into the air, okay? - [Tony] The whole object is to get it to us, Jessie! - [Johnny] Shut up, Tony. - Think you can reach us? We should probably move up. Oh boy! Stand still. - One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi. - [Johnny] Is that all you've got? - Come on, let it out. And? Come on. (clapping) * You're running on empty * 'Cause we're running wild all over you - Stuff him like a turkey. That's the way to stuff that big boy. One more time, two more downs, and it's over. Yeah, Jessie. - Like to see you try. - So, you're admitting you do have a pussy face, then? - Shut up. - [Tony] Good comeback, Jessie. Get open. Try me, it's all over. Fine. - Just give me a second to catch my breath. - Hey, Johnny, want a hit of my puffer? - Set. - [Lydia] You'll feel a lot better talking about it. - [Johnny] Hike! - How'd you know? - Your girl's got her way. Just make sure he uses a rubber, no matter how much the piece of shit begs you not to. (laughing) Wrap up the sausage, my mom always said. You wouldn't want to start aborting at our age. - God, Lydia, do you really have to be so blunt? - Well, how else are you gonna put something like that? Just remember the protection, and you won't have to worry, unless you're me, and your boyfriend doesn't believe in premarital sex. - Hike. - [Barbara\ He doesn't believe in sex? (laughing) - But blow jobs are perfectly fine, any hour of the day, or night. - Thanks for sharing. - Don't tell me you don't go down. - Just, whatever. Just promise me you won't tell my mom. Swear? - Swear. Cross my heart, and hope to die. - Hike. - One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi, six Mississippi, seven Mississippi. Come on, Johnny! He dropped the ball, Johnny! He dropped the ball! Get the ball! - Yeah, open, open, open, open. Woohoo! - Go baby, go baby. - All you had to do was hold onto the fucking ball, Jessie. - I couldn't help it, it just fell out of my hands. - Lame excuses. - Looks like my mojo's stronger than yours, Francis. You lose. - Looks like the game's finally over. - Let the arguing begin. Doesn't look like Francis's magic works. - Positive thinking crap didn't work this time. Woo! - It's freezing. Let's get out of here. - Yeah. Come on, guys, let's go! It's cold, let's go! - Let's go, Tony! It's cold! - [Tony] Relax. - Take your time, guys. Take your time. (laughing) - [Tony] Let's go, fellas. (laughing) What's that for, Barb? I guess God couldn't afford the rent, so they tossed him out. Welcome to the 21st century. - Guys, I used to go to this church with my mom. I was in my last year of Sunday school, until they closed it down. - I remember that. You even learned all the prayers, and stuff. - Oh yeah, I was an angel, right? - Yeah. - Come on, Barb. We don't need God anymore. - We didn't need God today. - That's right. Booya! (hip hop music on radio) - Yo! - Hey, what are you guys up to today? Going down to that basement? - Ah, it's Friday night, man. That's what we do. - Hey, man, you coming down tonight, or what? - Yeah, we'll see, man. You guys gonna be down there late? It's Friday night. - We'll be down there all night. It's gonna be a wild night. (laughing) - A wild night? Think I've heard it all. (peeling out) (hip hop music on radio) - Whoa. - Now, that is a fast machine. - And the end of friendships. - Hey, look, you still got us, for better or worse. - Looks like it's gonna rain. Let's get out of here. (thunder) (static on radio) - Can't get shit on the radio. It has to be the weather. - It is, most definitely. I'm so bored. - Where's your mom? - Out with her boyfriend. Look at Tony. I hope he loses. Actually, no I don't. Then he'll be miserable. - Francis seems to always win at everything. - Francis sucks lately, huh? - Yeah, he does. He's, I don't know. He has this like really bad attitude. - Why? - Every single day. I don't know. Whenever I try to talk to him, he's always grumpy about something. - He's like a miserable person. - Yeah, and I should be the grumpy one. - [Lydia] Well, we don't have that problem. That's why he doesn't believe in sex, remember? - [Barbara] Oh yeah? He likes to do other stuff. (laughing) - [Lydia] Unfortunately. (laughing) - I don't know, my mom doesn't know about any of this stuff, so she would kill me if she did. - [Lydia] She'd freak out. - Yeah. Oh my god. - [Lydia] I am so bored. - I'm out. - Got shit, right? - No, I got a royal flush. No shit, I got shit. If I had something, I wouldn't be out. I'd be in. - We should have just gone home before. - What's the matter with you guys tonight? So what if it's raining out all night? It's not raining in here. - Oh, it's raining down here, all right. It's raining boring. - Oh, boohoo, the honey's are bored. You could always call a cab, if you want to go home. You got a couple bucks, right, Barb? - Yeah, a couple. - Cab drivers give me the creeps. They all look like psychos to me. - I know, right. They're either way too skinny, way too fat. It's just disgusting, right? - Or they're like the biggest geeks ever. Not a normal one in the bunch, you know? Too bad my mom went out with her boyfriend tonight. She wouldn't mind picking us up. - What's the matter with you guys tonight? You're not getting enough attention from the boys? It's not even eight o'clock, and we're staying late tonight. I don't get no fucking service down here. - We never get service down here. - Shut up, Lydia. - This is boring. Every week, it's the same thing. This is always what you guys want to do. - You guys don't even consider what we want to do. - There's a time for that when we're alone. - Look, Francis, that's not what I'm talking about, believe me. - I'm out of this one. - Got shit, right? - Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce Christopher Columbus, world-famous discoverer. - You stupid bastard. - Well, I got three Aces. Read 'em and weep. - Again. - Come to Papa. - You guys are not even listening to us. Jesus, all you ever want to do is play poker, or play with your fucking balls. Can we do something we all can enjoy, for once? - I got it! Let's play strip poker. - I'm in. - You guys would be freaking cheating, and me and Barb would be naked in an half hour. - You're damn right. - Yeah, baby. Strip poker! Poker, poker! Get it. - Poke you upside your head, you think you're gonna play strip poker. Strip poker, your ass. - Easy, killer, we don't want to play cards. - How about some truth or dare? That'll be fun, guys, right? - We can all get into that. That's fun. - That's lame. How are we gonna know who's telling the truth? - Francis, the point of truth and dare is to tell the truth, to be as honest as possible. I know that's a bit difficult for you. - How about the dare part? - Are you guys going to do what you're dared to do? - You guys are such pigs, I swear it. (grunting) - Hey, didn't your parents ever teach you not to swear? - You guys are lame. - Hey, I'm with my man, Jessie, on some strip poker. - Yeah, baby! - Poker, poker, poker! - You sick albino bastard. Put your shirt back on, before you catch something. (laughing) - Like sheep without a shepherd. - So what's up, then? - I got it. I'm gonna go upstairs and get the game. - A game? - Not just a game. Mind-blowing. I'll be back. - He's so mysterious. - What the hell's he up to now? - Hope he's getting some weed. (thunder) (people talking) - [Francis] Some party. This is better than we got downstairs. - Oh, Francis. Oh, come here. Hey everybody, this is my son, Francis. I want to introduce him to you. This kid over the summer shot up. Look at him. Ten pounds of muscle for each inch on this kid. Come on, Francis. One time for everybody here. Make a muscle for everybody. - Dad, please, please, Dad. - Come on, don't be embarrassed. Your father's proud of you. - Honey, that boy has nothing to be embarrassed about. My god, so frickin' handsome. Yes, yes, my goodness. Oh, he has grown since the last time I saw him. - I have gotten much bigger. - Naughty boy. - That kid's gonna be all pro someday. All pro, ain't that right, son? - You bet, Dad. - [Francis's Dad] Chip off the old block, I tell ya. - Hey, you never made all pro. - [Francis's Dad] Well, I guess it all depends on who you ask. (people talking) (dance beat with singing in foreign language) - No baby sitter again, huh? (music) You're in the best place in the whole world. You just don't realize it yet. - You don't belong upstairs. - [Zora] Your son is a grownup man. - Join the party, Zora. (sigh) - Lighten up, bitch. - This one's a little young for you, isn't he? - If you're judging by my late husband, even you would be considered young. (laughing) - Here you go, doll. - Cheers. (dance beat) - Hey, I'm watching that. - No, you're not. - I'm not? - No. It's watching you. You know what this is? - Duh, books. - Wiseass. These books have all the answers that you're ever gonna need to know in your entire life. How old are you? - Nine. My birthday's next week. - So, you can read then, right? - Uh, yeah, for a long time. - Good. This is a good place for you to start, then. - The Holy Bible? What kind of a book is this? - The oldest one. It's about the beginning of mankind. - Is this about sex? 'Cause I know about sex. I know I became it in my mom's belly, and came out of mom's cookie. I saw the video. - This is about what you are, and what you can be. It's also a great place to start, if you want to know everything there is to know. - So, you read all these books, and now you know everything? - Yeah, I suppose I do. Don't put that TV back on. (dance beat with man singing in foreign language) - Ouija board, that's wicked cool. - Ouija, that's the fuckin' game you got? - Yeah, Ouija. You never heard of it? - This is cool, but, isn't this just a two-player game? - This is old. What's this do? - It points out the answers on the board. - Spells out the letters, whatever you ask. - I got this from the real deal. - Your ass, you did. - Fuck you, I got this from a gypsy. That, if she wasn't a witch, she had witches in her family. - Yeah, right. - How much did it cost? - 25 bucks. - 25 bucks? For a piece of wood? - I think you got a deal. If it works, I mean. - She said it's a real board. She also said it's very active. She also said, it's a secret. - Really? - You said it yourself, think about it. It's a two-player game? - I said that? - The more the better, up to six. With more than six, things can get kinda messy, you know? Think about it. With two, we could fiddle the spare plane of existence, but with six, we could penetrate that realm, and bend it to our will. - He said penetrate. (laughing) - Yes, my friend. Penetrate and control it. - Seance, seance! - We could do more than that. Anything we imagine, even more. - You know why they sell this game to kids, and it passes as a harmless game? 'Cause for two kids, it is a harmless game. Not for six, it's not harmless. It's far from it. - You're fucking kidding, right? - [Tony] Play without me. - But the number of the beast. We need six to match the power of the beast! - Fuck you, Francis. - Come on, Tony. Don't be such a party pooper. It's a harmless game. It'll be fun. - Harmless? - Don't push me. - For two, right. With all of us in at the same time, it becomes more than just a game. Way more. Count me out. All right, you should know this, Francis. - Don't be a wuss, man. Everyone's into this. Why do you go against me all the time? - 'Cause you don't fucking listen. All right, fuck you and your peer pressure. - What's the big deal, Tony? - Come on, man. We need six. Everyone's into this. Don't wuss out on us. Man. Six is the magic number. With six, we could tap into it. The creative, all-knowing force of the universe, and bend it to our wills. Ask and you will receive. Knock and the door will be opened. We could even raise the dead, if we wanted to. - You got no respect! All right, you think you can do whatever you want, without consequences. You have no idea what you're playing with. - Jesus, Tony, it's just a game. Will you just play, for crying out loud? - No, I'm not playing with this devil shit. Go ahead, play. - Fine, so five of us, then. Not what I had planned, but. - Less power than. - Is that still enough power to raise the dead? - I guess there's only one way to find out. - Let's raise a whole army of the dead. - An ambitious apprentice, I like that. Well, let's start small. Maybe, just maybe, we can raise one dead man from his grave. (howling) - It's all fun and games, until someone gets hurt. You guys should learn some respect for the old ways. - Okay, okay, already. We heard the sermon. The old way, yadda, yadda, yadda. This is the 21st century, brother. You better get used to it. - Jeez, already. Let's just play, and ask it some questions. I'm dying to see if this thing really works. - I want to play. I have questions, and I need answers. Come on, guys, let's play. - So gay. He wants to play. - All right guys, let's settle down. If we're going to do this, let's do it right. Everyone's a little familiar, right? That's it. Lightly. Only just touch it. Good. Now, press your feet against each others. Form and feel connected. Let the aura float around you, as I begin the prayer of protection from malicious spirits. Protect us, guide us, and fulfill our desires to know that which is hidden in plain sight. Protect these whom you have given me to lead. - You're gonna lead them, all right. - And even Tony, though he don't believe. - Fuck you, Francis. Don't even mention my name. - That's it, it's done. We're all protected and connected. Like a conductor plugged into the mainframe. We start by seeing if anyone's here. Go ahead, Barbara, ask. - Is anyone there? Like that? - [Lydia] It's moving. Someone's moving it. - Nobody's moving it. Ask a question. - Me, okay. I need to know about the girl with the bun in her hair. The one, she's in my English class. Does she have the hots for me? (laughing) - Oh. Looks like you're never getting laid, man. - She wants me. You guys moved it. I know she wants some of this. - Nobody moved it. Maybe someday, when you grow up, if you keep dreaming, she'll let you get it in. - Your wet dreams. - Fist pump. - You know what, jerk. So what if she did like Jessie? She ain't no better than him. I've seen her dating worse-looking guys. - Ouch, that's a low blow, Barb. Jessie ain't that ugly. (laughing) - You suck, Barbara. - Jessie, I didn't mean to say you're an ugly guy. That's not what I meant. What I meant was that she doesn't date any better than you. I mean. (laughing) You know what I'm trying to tell you, right? - Yeah, I know what you mean. - Well, I don't have the slightest. Could you clarify that, Barb? - You're such a dick. - I'm your dick. - What I meant to say, Francis, is that you're a big fucking asshole. - The king, baby. - My turn to ask the next question. - Roll. - Promise not to laugh? Ouija, can you tell me about my dog? Booboo, my dog. I lost him when I was five, and I never got over it. What I'd like to know is if he's in a dog heaven, somewhere. Is there a doggy heaven? (laughing) - [Johnny] What a stupid question. - You guys promised you wouldn't laugh at her. Seriously, you're just a bunch of jerks. - Actually, guys, I read somewhere in one of the old spiritual books, that the souls of animals reincarnate back as the same animal, and eventually do pass from this existence to the next. - Really? So, you mean, I could go out, and get another dog, and it could be Booboo again? - What a crock. Where'd you get that from? - It's from the Hindu belief system. It states that the atman, or soul, if you want to call it, travels from death to rebirth, until it reaches nirvana. - Nirvana, that's the Buddhist doctrine, not Hindu. And as for souls or atman, or whatever, if you knew anything, you would know that even an amoeba has a life force. Maybe you can come back as one of them. - Look, all I'm saying is that I read it from somewhere. You're not the only person that reads shit, Francis. - This is really interesting. Come on, Tone, play with us. - I already told you, no. - What is it that scares you so much? You're really that scared of the unknown? - Don't mistake respect of the unknown for fear of it. You know about karma, the idea that things come full circle. You especially should know about karma. - Karma. - You know what I'm talking about. - All right, you guys are reading way too many books. Can we just play, or what? (clapping) - Bravo. You have all the answers, Francis. Never mind me. - You need to get with it. This is a new century. "Do as you will" is the new law. - Man, Francis, you're so full of shit. - Enough bologna. Let's get serious. Hands. Feet together. Good. - [Lydia] You're moving it. - I'm not moving it. - Yes you are. - [Johnny] It's going to the same letters. Is it stuck? - How can it be stuck if it's moving? - Try to figure out the letters. - You figure them out. You're the expert. - Interesting. Stay with us, spirits. Do not leave us in ignorance, but help us to know your hidden meaning. - Amen. - [Women] It's moving. - Shh, you have to concentrate. - What is your name? (whispering) That doesn't spell Ouija. - Not even close. - I thought you said its name was Ouija. - I got Honjo out of that. That's the only name I could think of. - You guys were moving it. - Is anybody moving it? What's the point of moving it? That wouldn't be any fun at all. - You know, I know a kid in school who mentioned he had an uncle named Honjo. - Maybe it's an Indian name. - Sounds it. - So, Honjo it is. - It's fucking backwards. - [Francis] Let them figure this out. - You didn't know either. - It's so obvious. - [Lydia] Yeah, it really is. - [Tony] Yeah, now that I told you. - That's what I meant, jerk. - It was Jonah, guys. The last letter was J. - Let's ask if his name is Jonah. - Ask, then. - Is that your name? Jonah, is that it? - [Lydia] It is. - How long have you been gone from our planet? - Plane. - We live on a planet, not a plane. - Forget it. How old were you when you were passing from this plane to the next? - 69, or is it backwards? 69, is that correct? - Yes, it's not backwards. - How come it's not backwards anymore? - It's fully awake now. - Guys, I got the chills, man. - How did you die? (whispering) - Poison? Poisoned. That's it, you were poisoned. He was murdered? Murdered by who? Who murdered you, Jonah? - Tell us who did it. I guarantee you'll feel a lot better if you do. - With joson. - With, wife. I bet it means his wife. - I feel so bad for him. Sorry, Jonah. Why? Why did she do it? - M- O-Y. - [Johnny] Freakin' money. - Root of all evil. - Oh my god, you guys. This thing is telling us it was murdered by his wife, and she did it by poisoning him for money. Wow, this is crazy-- - [Jessie] Is your wife dead with you? So, she's alive. (spirit breathing) - (In deep Voice] Soon, she will join you. - Lydia, are you okay? - That was freaking freaky. - How did you do that? - He spoke through me. - Is this what you were talking about, when you said you wanted to do something you could get into? - Wicked. - Call him to join us, Lydia. - Come to us, Jonah. Now you say it. - Come to us, Jonah. - Come to us, Jonah. - Come to us, Jonah. - Come to us, Jonah. - [Lydia] Come to us, Jonah. Tony's waiting for you. (laughing) - Don't be a fucking jerk, Lydia. - Don't call me a fucking jerk. You're the fucking jerk. - Cool your jets, all right? I didn't call you anything. I said don't be. I didn't say you are. - I know what you said. I'm not stupid. - All I'm saying is, I'm not playing, so leave me out of this devil shit. - We must concentrate. Otherwise, this won't work. You need to believe. We must believe. - Come to us, Jonah. Come to us, Jonah. Jonah, come to us. - That's the spirit. Come to us, Jonah. Come to us, Jonah. - Bastards. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. - [All together] Come to us, Jonah. (thunder) (strange loud sounds) (frightening music) (thunder) (frightening music) (intense music) (thunder) (screeching music) (thunder) - I'm telling you guys. All right, you guys were possessed. - Possessed. Yeah, sure. Tell us another one. - I don't kid, all right. I'm serious. You all changed. - Changed how? - Devil voices came out of you guys. - [Barbara] Can you stop it, please? - No, I want to know this. - What a freaking headache. - Then when I got up to stop you guys, your eyes. Big and white like golf balls. I've ripped the planchet right from your hand, and smashed it. - You telling me something was inside me, man? - What did we do? - We went into a reverie, that's all. - Reverie? - Meaning that we went into a trance-like state, affording a channel into a spirit world. - You say that like it's fucking routine. Come on, guys, let's channel the spirits of the dead. It'll be fun. - You knew something like this could happen, and you still let us play? - Whoa, whoa, didn't you girls say you needed stimulating? - Not by letting spirits inside of us. - So, subjecting everyone to demons is your idea of stimulation? - Demons? - Look, I know what I saw, all right? You guys know I don't lie. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - [Tony] Seriously. - Can we just forget it? Look how upset it's making her. (coughing) (whispering voices) - God, deliver us from evil. (tense aura) - Something just doesn't feel right about this. (buzzer) (squeal) - Hey guys. Ah, thanks for stealing my seat, Tony. - [Tony] Just keeping it warm for you, Barb. - [Barbara] Yeah, yeah. (laughing) - Feeling better? - A bit shelly. - Yeah, I just thought you were getting a little horny. (laughing) - Always a dick. - [Tony] Anyone hear that? - Shh, listen. - Francis, please, I think something's wrong. - Will you shut up, and listen? - [Barbara] Francis, what, what are you doing? - [Tony] Will you shut up and listen? - [Jessie] Help, he's fucking possessed. (shouting) (scream) - Tony, do something, do something. - This is the type of shit I'm talking about. Johnny, help me pull him off. - Help. - Jesus! Deliver him! (farting sound) - Will you get off me before I shit myself? - Everything's always a fucking joke with you. (laughing) - Fuck you, Francis. - It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt, and someone could have gotten hurt. - Oh, it smells like shit. - I can't stand you anymore. Do you realize what you're doing to a person? - I got you best of all. What did you say? Deliver him, Jesus! Jesus! (laughing) What a fuckin' riot. You guys, you're too much. I had all you guys looking like you seen the devil himself. Come on, I really did get you with this one. - You got to admit, it was a rush and a half. - You guys, you're too much. I gotta take a piss, I gotta take a piss. - Yeah, take a crap too while you're at it. (buzzer) - [Francis] You guys, too fuckin' much. - Lighten up, it's just a joke. (perplexing music) (peeing) (perplexing music) (doorbell) - Hey, what's going on? (laughing) Long time, no see. (excitedly talking) (sinister music) (buzzer) - I know you guys think I'm an asshole, and I am, but I want you guys to know no matter what, I really do love you. - [Men] We love you too, man. - Imagine if it did really happen. - Imagine what? - [Johnny] Raising the dead. - You'd shit. - I'd shit myself so bad. - I would shit and piss myself. (laughing) - You'd all shit, all right. Every single one of you. - You wouldn't, hero? (banging on wall) (bang) (scream) - Really scary, guys. I'm really shaking in my shoes, now. Who's out there? Of course. Who else could it be? Why, it's Jonah. Recently revived from the dead. After all, you did invite him. I'm gonna go welcome our guest, then. - [Johnny] Maybe it's Joe messing with our heads. - I bet it is. - [Johnny] What the fuck do you think he's up to? (perplexing music) * Oh where, oh where, could this asshole be * Oh where, oh where (bang) - Go get him, killer. (bang) - Who is it, Tony? Can you see? (perplexing music) - Real funny, Joe. (perplexing music) Wait for it, Joe. (terrifying music) - What the fuck, Joe? Are you fucking kidding me, man? What the fuck? Joe, no. Joe, no. No, no, Joe, no. Don't do it, Joe. Why? Why? No, Joe, don't do it. Joe, get away Joe, no! (screaming) - Help me, guys! Help me! Help me, guys! No, no, Joe! (bludgeoning) - Tony! - [Francis] Fuckin' Joe, I warned that asshole. - It's not Joe. - He's on drugs, the stupid prick. What are you up to now, Joe? - It's not Joe. - Give me a chair, give me a chair. (crying) - What happened, Lydia? What did you see? - Tony's dead. (crying) - [Johnny] What do you mean, he's dead? - He hit him over the head. He took him in the back room, and he whacked him right in the head. - Did you see who it was? - He's dead. (crying) (bludgeoning) (crying) - Tony. Tone. - He's dead. Tony's dead. - Is that Joe? - Is it Jonah? Did we do it? - Are you insane? Joe's been taking all kinds of drugs. He probably took some bad shit, and lost his mind. - And what if it's Jonah? - [Barbara] Please, no. (terrifying music) - What did you see? - Stop it, Johnny. Stop it. - We need to get this bird out. - What are you gonna do against Jonah? - It's Joe. Fuckin' druggy. - I told you, it was Jonah. He killed him. All that blood, Tony's blood, all over, and Jonah laughing at me, wanting me to see it. What are we gonna tell Tony's mom? - It's just Joe out there, it's just Joe. - No it's not. - [Francis] We have to do something. The three of us will get him, head upstairs, and people get help. Do you hear them? - Yeah, and what if it's Jonah, and we can't get through? - It's three of us against him. He's probably on some fuckin' bad trip, and one of us will make it upstairs. - I'm afraid, Francis. (crying) - Honey, the first time I married for love. Second time, I married for money. And frickin' lots of it. (laughing) - So, what's it gonna be for this time? - This time? Seriously, why would I ever marry again? - What about him? - Him? Just to amuse myself. A man's only good for one thing, cock. And the bigger their thing is, the better. - Sorry, there's only so much man that you can handle. - Oh, believe me, honey. You don't know how much I can handle. Neither do I. (laughing) (party music) (tense music) - Oh my god, Joe what did you do? - [Jessie] Is that blood? Holy shit. - There's blood everywhere. - Joe, just keep your head cool. We can get you some help. (tense music) Oh, god. (coughing) - [Jessie] What the hell? (frightening music) - [Francis] Nails, get me nails. - There aren't any big enough! - [Francis] Give me the ones you got! What good are those? - That's all there are! - Those are no good. - What the hell did you do that for? - [Francis] Those aren't gonna keep it out, if it wants to get in. (frightening music) - Puffer is empty. - He's not breathing. He's not breathing. - Breathe, damn it. You don't die like this, breathe! - [Barbara] Stop it! He's not breathing. What to do? (tempered piano) Please. I don't know what to do. - You don't die like this! Breathe! Breathe. (tempered piano) (crying) - Please, please. - What are you doing? Don't stop. That's it. - Stop it, Johnny. Stop it! You're breaking his ribs! Stop. Jessie was dead already, Johnny. We did what we could. - He gave up. I tried to save him. - What will we tell his mom? Jonah got you two, Jessie. - Jessie got Jessie. He didn't fight. He should've fought, and not given up! Stop looking at him! - How can this be happening? I can't. I don't want to die. - [Johnny] Come on, Barb. - We're only just kids. God, please, we didn't mean for any of this to happen. (crying) - That doesn't matter anymore. We're all dead. - Would you just shut up, Lydia? - It's all a joke. Everything we thought that mattered just doesn't. All one big fat meaningless joke. - You're on my nerves, like I can't even tell you, so just shut up! (party music) - I propose a toast. (party music) Everyone, everyone, I propose a toast to my dear departed husband, to my dear JJ Matthias. (party music) To my dear JJ Matthias, let it be known, in the company of friends, that I love you even more now that you're dead than when you were alive. - [All together] Cheers. (laughing) (rock beat) (people socializing) (growling) - I'm not ready! All my dreams I have. (heartbeat) - [Deep Voice Echoing] It was a joke, Tony. I never meant for any of this to happen. - I warned you. Too much to listen. - Sorry. - It's too late for that, Francis. Our world is gone, in your fool's game. I warned you. It's all your fault. Your fault we all died tonight. - I'm so sorry. - It's all your fault, Francis. Our dreams are shattered, because of you. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. - It's all my fault. - Your fault. - It's all my fault. - It's all your fault. - It's all my fault. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. It's all my fault! - Francis, please stay strong. - It's all my fault, Barbara. - No one is putting blame. No one is blaming you. - Yes, they are. They want me to do something. - Francis, no one's blaming you. - Yes they are. - No. No one is. - Tony and Jessie want me to. I know what I have to do. - No, you're insane. We need you! Our baby needs you. - Are you really pregnant? - [Johnny] I gotta go help him. Dude, look out behind you! Run, dude, run! (voices echoing) (laughing) (party music) (laughing) (bludgeoning) No, Francis! (laughing) (party music) (tense music) - No. No! - Three down, three to go. - My god, what have we done? - There's no god. Only death. - [Barbara] Stop it, Lydia. You don't know what you're saying. - It's a joke. Life is one big, fat, meaningless joke. This is what you want for your baby? Life and everything in it, it's all a lie. Everything we thought was true. Such a hoax. - Just don't lose hope. - Hope is for those who can't face the truth. Face the truth, Barbara. - You just have to pull yourself together, all right? Me and Johnny need you, we need you. - Accept it. Stop lying to yourself. It's a dream you wake up from, and forget it. That's life, and death, and we're already dead. (laughing) - No, there has to be a way out of this. There has to be a way to send it back. (laughing) With this, we got this thing here with us, and we'll send it back with it. (laughing) Lydia, it will work. We just have to believe it. We can do this. - It's not going to work. - It will work. (laughing) - No, it won't. - It will. We have to believe it will, and it will work. (laughing) - It's not gonna work, Barbara. - [Barbara] Johnny, it will work. We just have to believe, please. - It's not gonna work, no matter how hard we try. - [Barbara] Can we just try at least? - [Lydia] All good things come to an end, Barbara. We're all going to die. Me, you, Johnny, and your fucking baby. (rushing sound) (laughing) Fucking stupid baby. (laughing) - You know why it won't work? - No. - Because Tony broke it, remember? - Not you. Not you too. (laughing) - We're all going to die, and you just have to accept it. (laughing) - It's broken, Barbara. There's pieces everywhere. - It doesn't matter about the broken pieces. Somehow it still has to work. - Ugh, you're wasting your fucking time. - Time? I'm wasting my time? You're wasting your time. Even if it doesn't work, at least I did something with my time. - [Johnny] Damn it, Barbara's right. - Yeah, I am right. - I mean, we didn't follow any rules to get this thing here. We believed. - If we believe like we did before, we can send Jonah back. - [Lydia] How do we start? Do you know what to say? - [Barbara] No. We just have to believe that we can send Jonah back. Let's join hands and feet, like we did before. (perplexing piano) - I don't know what to say, so, I'm just gonna say what I'm feeling. - Can we do this like this? (perplexing piano) - Before today, I thought I knew everything I needed to know. Now, I realize I know nothing. Nothing at all. What we did, we did out of ignorance. Tony knew somehow. He tried. He warned us, because he knew and respected the power, and he was afraid. He was afraid because he knew we were ignorant of these things. Maybe we should try to apologize for being disrespectful. - Please forgive us, Jonah. - We are really, really sorry. Please forgive us, Jonah. - Truly, Tony, Jessie, and Francis are sorry. All in respect of the supernatural gained at the fearful price of our friends' lives. - Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. - Please forgive us, Jonah. Go back, and rest in peace. - [All together] Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. Forgive us, Jonah. Go back and rest in peace. - Mom? Mom. (party music) (people laughing and talking) - Mom? Mom. - What is it, hon? - Mom, can you get me a glass of water? - Sure. (party music) - Here, drink up. (music on TV) Relax, hon. Mommy's downstairs, okay? - Do you think it worked? Do you think we sent it back? - Him. - What? - Jonah was a man. Him, not it. - Him, it. I don't give a shit. Did we do it? Did we send whatever the hell it is back to wherever the hell it came from? - Easy, Johnny. We sent him back. Can't you feel it. - All I can feel is that I'm starting to crack. This is so much to grasp. How can you be so cool? - Because somebody has to be. - That's it, I'm outta here. If it's gone, so am I. - What are you doing? - I don't know. - Relax, Johnny. Everything's okay. - How can you be so cool? - Because everything's okay. He's gone. Can't you feel it? - I can feel it. We sent him back. We did it, Johnny. - Then let's get the hell out of here. What are we waiting for? - No, we stay in here. We just have a few more hours left till sunrise. We'll leave then. - It's gone, Jonah's gone. Can't you feel it? - No, we stay in here. - If it's gone, it's gone! I need to get out of here now! - No, just a few more hours. - It's gone, Barbara. Don't you trust me? Then let's get the fuck out of here. Johnny. (whispering voices) He's gone. Come on, guys. Don't be afraid. Jonah's gone. Can't you feel it? Jonah's gone away. Come on, Johnny. We made it through. He's not here anymore. See? He's gone. No Jonah anymore. Can't you feel it? I'm surprised you can't feel it. We made it. We fucking made it. - [Johnny] Stop. - Let's go. (deep voice laughing quietly) - [Barbara] Don't. Don't go. - Nope. Nobody here. What are you waiting for? - Let's go. - No. (deep voice laughing quietly) - Here's Jonah. (laughing) - [Barbara] What are you doing? (laughing) (frightening music) Come and get them, Jonah. (laughing) Just go with it. - [Johnny] Shut up! - Jesus, why is he still here? - Guys, come on, scream! Make some noise! Someone's gotta hear us! Help! God, come on! - Help! - [Johnny] Help! - Help! - Come on, somebody help! - Somebody! - [Johnny] Help! Help, help! Can anyone hear us? Help! Help, come on! - [Lydia] Hail Mary, full of grace. Blessed is the tooty fruit of your womb. (laughing) - Stop laughing at me. (laughing) If you want to die, then go die! - [Johnny] Come on, guys! Don't stop! Keep screaming! Help! Guys! What are you guys doing? Don't stop! Keep screaming! My head hurts. I'm not screaming. - Why doesn't anyone hear us. (party music) (people socializing) (voices whispering) - One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five Mississippi, six Mississippi, seven Mississippi. (wind) - [Barbara] Lydia, what are you doing? Lydia, don't, don't. (footsteps) (strange music) - Come, Jonah. Take me away with you. - No! (strange music) (frightening music) - Don't look at him. (frightening music) (frightening music) (rock beat) (breathing heavily) You piece of shit. You really got nothing. (rock beat) Go back to hell. (rock beat) (screaming) No! No! No! No! No! Oh god, no! (rock beat) No! (rock beat) (breathing heavily) - [Barbara] Oh my god! (scream) (piquant music) (breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (electronic music) (people talking) - Oh my god, oh my god. Oh, honey, honey. What happened? Oh, easy. Easy, I got you, honey. Hold on, hold on. I got you, I got you. I got you, hold me. Easy. Oh, sweetheart, you're okay. You got me, I'm all right. Oh my god, please take her. Someone call 9-1-1, please. Please. Stay here. (screaming) No! No! Oh, Jesus, whoa! (screaming) (police sirens) (orchestra music) (dramatic orchestra music with choir) (whispering) - Tell me you're gonna be fine. (dramatic orchestra music with choir) - Get this girl outta here. (dramatic orchestra music with choir) This world's gone mad. (dramatic orchestra music with choir) (hip hop beat through radio) - Fuck happened here? They weren't fuckin' kidding, a fucking wild night.
