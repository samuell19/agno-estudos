Ok Dad as well From now on I will never be a thief again Why Why do we have to be thieves? You guys stop being thieves! You are not young, you should also retire Even if you say so, there is no age limitation for the thief I will never let Apricot be a thief It's because of the lovely granddaughter that I've been striving to go on Children often fail and fall So they need the warm hands of parents Regardless what kind of parents are Be happy! I won't be merciful Me too I will never let you pass Hubby Hubby I have been suffering for being L's daughter And troubling I think it would be nice if I wasn't born into this kind of family But the one who has been by my side and watching over me Gave me lots of love You should have had one before Such a beloved family The family love your deeply Shut up You're just cursing fate Just avoiding reality I am the daughter of a family of thieves I will live with this fact Atonement for your sins Don't do it Ling Ling Sorry Thank you for still being alive Ling That night Your dead husband was stalked by the gang though But he managed to escape But after finally running away, he ran back to find them by himself Please return the bag to me -What are you doing - Give my bag back - Hey - Give my bag back Wait, I'll give you the money but give me the bag back Don't touch me Ugly clown Hey, don't do this You bastard, I'll really kill you if next time come again Go to the next stall Ah, so tired Very scary Wait a minute Wait a minute -Oh no -Hey, hurry to go! The reason he turned back regardless Is to get the stuff back here Be nice Wait at home with mom! Hey, what's wrong with your finger Nothing Can you come over here? Wait a minute! Put this next to Hua's pillow when you get back Got it I am Santa Claus How are you doing? How are you doing? Come on people, someone help! Who can help? What he desperately wants to protect is the Christmas gift you knitted for Hua This is the truth about the day when he died Can I have that glove? Thank you The photo obtained by the detective who has been following the L family It is pasted on the investigation data This belongs to you Exchange this Haha, seems too early I have vowed to take revenge with my own hands But didn't make it Because that person lost their family member just like I me Just a lonely person Meiyun You are no longer alone I'll be by your side Thank you Waiting for the crown to arrive What are you talking about Isn't there a crown? No. do has Mr. Hao, thank you for your help What's going on here? King of this country Because he knows that the king of thieves, Ling, coveted the crown Feeling very scared So I secretly went to find the "Mother of Dibbenburg", whose divination will surely come true in the legend To discuss this matter A little case Immediately just hide the crown But an unexpected thing happened The whole map recording the location of the treasure fell into the basement So ask Mr. Hao to throw us into the basement too That was dropped on purpose Also by the way to confirm whether Ling really wants to kill the L family So only plan B can be implemented, changed the past Who is the person asked Mr. Motojoji to save me? It's me, because I'm honored to be a part of the L family troupe. No way This is simply a farce I said As long as the L family locked target, they will definitely get it Almost died before it arrived! Blame Motojoji for not coming even after waiting for a long time, that's frozen Although it's good to freeze and preserve my beauty Okay, let's go to get the crown No need to bother You saved my life This will be a gift for you This is really picking up something on the sly It is too over, why return my crown Etsuko, listen to me, I'm not returning back It is used as a negotiating tool Negotiation To ask him to be lenient on Ling's sentence Dad Sakuraito Grandpa and Grandma are here too. Why are dad and others here too? We asked them to come To help end this journey It is a special gift from us Dad Hmm Thank you Thank you for always raising me! Hmm How to prepare so thoughtfully It's really hard Can't find a dress that fits Hua and Kazuma A number of pieces stolen can not work Stolen The dress was prepared by Etsuko and mom To make the wedding as gorgeous as a painting My dad and I are responsible for all decorations Could it be that all this stuff was stolen? Right The treasure, the chorus and the priest were all stolen Don't you mean to stop being a thief? Yeah, didn't you say you're going to retire? Always fierce like this will grow wrinkles -What do you mean by growing wrinkles -Okay Misako My dear, I suddenly want to have another wedding Great, you can do it several times! (Kanda Yuno: Japanese noble woman star once spent 150 million to have nine weddings with her husband) Great, you can do it several times! -Just like Kanda Yuno -What a joke!
