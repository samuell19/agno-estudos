This has a firing range of over 100 meters, right. No. Air rifles used in competition can't do that. Why can't you believe it? But you still forced me to make it. What can I do! The money has been transferred already. It uses this machine. You can just use this to compress the air. Compression is a bit slow. It takes 5 seconds. If it's not compressed enough it won't have strength. Compress it too much and it'll explode. One. Two. Three. Four. Fuck! Seriously! -=26 Years=- Seon of kind-hearted. Seon of fresh. Suk of exquisite. Yeong of flower bud. Im of forest. Mi of beautiful. Jeong of honest. Jin of treasure. Jin of progress. Yes, that one. That one sounds okay. Huh? What? Jin? Yes, Jin. Mi Jin. Sim Mi Jin. Not Jin of treasure. What did you say it was? Jin of progress. That's right. That one. The name sounds good, and has a good meaning. Just like you said, bravely advancing-- Honey. Honey. What is this? Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey! Fuck, why is this? Honey! Where exactly are we going? I don't know either. Quickly, quickly get out of the vehicle! Get out! Leave! Leave! Jeong Hyeok. - It's servicemen ajussi (older man). - What is it? Fire! Jeong Hyeok! Run! Quickly! Quickly! Don't leave any alive! Follow along quickly! Nuna, come quickly. (Nuna: sister) Nuna. Are you all right? Nuna. Jeong Hyeok. You can go back by yourself, right? I don't want to. Die! Reds. (derogatory term for ROK Army) Hurry up. You go ahead. I will catch up with you. They're still alive over there! Little child, go quickly Don't let off even one! Die! Where are the others? Where are they? Nuna! Nuna! Quickly catch them! Nuna! Nuna! What do I do? You... What did I do wrong? You... You are not even a bit ashamed? As a national serviceman... You beasts! Damn Reds! Damn Reds! Damn Reds! Damn Reds! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? No! Where is he? Mom. Where is he? Jin Bae's father. What do I do? My child's father... Jin Bae's father. Jin Bae's father! Mom. Don't cry. How do we both keep on living? You won't die well! You murderous maniacs won't die well! Being able to be elected as the 11th-term president today, I am thankful towards the National Conference for Unification and to the people. Didn't I tell you last time! I'm really sorry. - I'm sorry. - Ajumma! (older woman) Don't you have a problem in your head? You should rest if you have a problem. How many times has it been? I'm sorry. I'm truly, really sorry. Take it as I'm pitying you. I'll just pretend the matter last month and today never happened. So, starting tomorrow, don't come. Madam, Madam, I am really sorry. Stop saying sorry. It hasn't been once or twice. What exactly do you want? In plain clothes, Mr. President is observing the lives of the people. Hey. Where's her son? Where's Jin Bae? Mom. Mom. Mr. President. Mom. For the people living in poverty, he wants to work harder to invigorate the economy. As I am set to retire, I do not have any regrets or desires. Dad, is it because Seoul is more beautiful than Gwangju that we're moving, eh? When we go to Seoul, we have to go on a steamboat. Die! Here. Be careful on your way. There'll still be opportunities next spring. Quickly go and see your father. The former president involved in the 5.18 incident (Gwangju Massacre) and accepting bribes was pardoned and release today. The former president expressed apology for negative influence on society. What worth is there in broadcasting this? Chief. Yeah. Doesn't it look like the ending scene of gangster movies? Oh, man. It really does. But still, wasn't he not bad? The economy improved. We held the Olympics. Isn't that right? Hey, Ajussi. Give me a cigarette. Oh, it's cold. Ajussi. Lighter. Let's go. Walk faster. The train heading to Seoul is about to depart. Passengers heading to Seoul, get ready. Citizens are discontent with the pardon of the former president, and are staging a large-scale protest. Especially requesting his assets to be made public... People need to have a conscience! Hurry up and take your father. Kill the fuckers. Kill all you animals! Once again, I wasn't able to go for training. Because of you, Dad. Dad, just die. Hurry up and leave. I'm in a good mood today. I won't charge you. Why? Today is the day my son returns from the army. Don't drink any more. Really? Quickly go. I'm leaving. Put this down first. When is he coming over... No. Indeed Mom, you haven't changed a bit. You're still the same. You haven't changed a bit. Not even a bit. What are you doing? That punk has gone crazy. Get him! Mercy. Let me go. You're dead! Hey punk. Are you tired of living? Punk. He really is a madman. Hey, brother. We're all business people. There's no need to be like this. What? Business? That's really hilarious, this bunch of gangsters. Your words are really unpleasant. Can't you understand what I'm saying? Doesn't it have wheels? Can't you just push the stall and go? It's not like there's water in my brain. Why must I leave such a good location? Starting with my mother, we've been here for 10 years! Say that again. To put it nicely, just follow instructions. Do whatever you like. Disembowel me if you want. Who's the one that's a gangster? Get lost punks. The sauce is all spilt. Damn, do they all want to die? You're not getting lost? =About Gwangju...= =I'll put it this way.= =That was an insurrection.= =It couldn't not be suppressed.= =If measures weren't taken,= =politics wouldn't be able continue.= Why are you so agitated? Aigoo. Your head can even be full of sweat from sitting down. At least don't mention it between people from Gwangju. I came today to try your noodles. Wow! These noodles are pretty good. Since ancient times, power... Keeping a balance is the most important. You can't survive just be relying on courage. Kid. Don't look at me with that expression. I'm not that kind of gangster at least. Come to our shop when you have time. I treat to a drink. =The next story.= =The former president stands in the courtroom once again after 6 years.= =Under the intense requests of opposition groups to publicize his assets,= =the former president names 291 000 Won as his total worth.= =You can just look at my deposit book.= =My balance is 291 000 Won, indeed.= Son of a bitch. Go to hell! Dirty mutt! There's no point to living. Hey, Gwon Jeong Hyeok. Just relax. Take it. Focus. Just push it when you see a car come over. Got it? Simple, right? But seriously, he's playing badminton and making it such a big deal. Ordering the police around. Oh, you poor guy. Why? It's your first time. The feeling is like being raped. I don't understand what you're saying. You'll come to understand. =His car is coming.= =Get ready.= It's coming over. =Change the signal.= Jeong Hyeok. You're hungry, eh? Quickly eat. Nuna. Even as a police officer, I can do it. Seriously... Nothing is of any use. This kind of life is really nauseating, it makes me sick. I'm sorry, Nuna. I'm really sorry. Nuna. Nuna. Hey! Hey, come over. You have to move out again? We have to quickly move out. Hey, Gu Won Bin. Why are you going out too? Isn't Gwon Jeong Hyeok on duty? Is he ill? I don't think this task is suitable for him. What are you talking about? He didn't say so himself, but we learned afterward. His sister lost her life in the Gwangju incident. Yes, well then. Go on. Ajussi, please go. This isn't a place to freely wander around in. Don't do this kind of work. Go home! Ajussi, you should go home. It's dangerous here. Go home quickly! Ajussi, it's dangerous for you. Please quickly go home. If you won't go then forget it. Ajussi. You can't drink alcohol there. You'll be taken away. Ajussi. Ajussi, what are you doing? You can't do that. Everyone go to hell! What's happening? Quickly put it out! Come out. It's not over. Let's die together. Come out quickly. What is that? Quickly seize him. Come out! Come out! Come out! Grab the beer bottle. What's happening? Fire extinguisher! Fire extinguisher! Quickly spray him! Get some cloth to cover him. Quickly, quickly, move. Disperse, disperse. Quickly clean this place up. Contact the police department. Mi Jin. Do you know why your name is Mi Jin? We wanted you to keep pushing forward courageously. Do you know who gave you that name? Your mother. Your mother chose it. After your mother passed, I had wanted to go to Seoul with you. Allowing you to eat well, and drink well. Spending the days nicely. Really. =Because of military dictatorship= =the serious offender was sentenced to death.= =And also 220.5 billion Won in fines,= =but admitted he only had 290 000 Won.= =In the end, he still hasn't paid back in full.= =Does the audience still remembers, right?= =At present, he is still living luxuriously.= =At this very moment, his power is still unstoppable.= Thank you. Have you all eaten? Hyeongnim. Someone's looking for you inside. Who is it? I don't know the person. This place is closed for business. I know. It seems like I've seen you before. You still remember. Before, at your father's funeral, I greeted you. It looks like you're not from within our circle. A gentlemen like yourself, what brings you to come find me? It's difficult to say, eh? How is it? You want me to kill someone? Oh my. It seems to be true. I don't know what is it, but everything should be settled in a suitable manner. Understand? Okay, end it there. Goodbye. You too, know that person. Hey. Kid. You've all come from afar. It's been hard for you. I'm Gim Gap Se. For your coming here, I'm very grateful. You saw me last time. I'm Gim Ju An. I'm Chairman Gim Jia Se's secretary. This is Gwon Jeong Hyeok. He is a police officer. And this is the national representative shooter, Sim Mi Jin. - And this is... - Gwangju ruffian Gwak Jin Bae. The members are a bit incongruous. We're all survivors of 5.18 Gwangju. Although we haven't known each other long, but at least regarding this, I think we can do it together. Hang on. Forget about the situation over here. I don't know about the situation over there. What regrets does a gentlemen like yourself have for you to do such things. - I will tell you about the chairman's situation. - I'm not asking you. What? You're a survivor too? - No. - Then? I was a martial law trooper. Ha, I really can't watch anymore. Then it can't be let go. Let me confirm something. Have you also killed people of Gwangju? No matter what, as one of the martial law troopers that entered Gwangju, I apologize to all of you first. I'm sorry. To me, May 1980-- Stop it there. Let's differentiate between what's necessary and what we're curious about. I'm not interested in any of you here. Even if this person was a martial law trooper and killed people of Gwangju, I don't care. At least he has the same goal as me. That's sufficient. My, this lady has really big guts. I'll do it. We're really going to kill him? What I want is an apology for his offences. I have to see the appearance of that person's sincere apology. Everything after that will depend on that person's attitude and change. I, too, will do it. Fuck. Continuing like this, are we going to mix our blood, and eat something? It's been a long time since I've made it. I don't know if it'll have the same taste as before, Hyeongnim. This isn't my kitchen. I couldn't find any kimchi. This is enough. Could I wish for a feast? I'm really grateful to you. Up till now, I haven't said that even once. However, I'm sorry. There's something I have to do. Please allow me to leave. Something you have to do? What is it? I'm sorry. I can't say. Have you forgotten? I'm a gangster. You're my family member. I need a reason. I need to go to Seoul to buy cigarettes. You rude punk. As everyone knows, when he goes out, he'll mobilize armed guards and police officers. That face looks familiar. According to the situation, there will be a flexible number of guards using lethal power. It's not possible to accurately guess the number of bodyguards. The surrounding residences will be vacant or used by guards. Besides these, there are several others used by the guards. Firstly, if we look at all the buildings of suspicion, this is the scope. Also, entering his residence or seeing him outside is impossible. Right. Have a look at where you've all been gathered. The construction is the same as his residence. - =Please look over here.= - What are you doing? - Ajussi. - What are you doing? First, start by confusing the network of guards. At the entrance, there will be conscripted officers and plain clothes officers, and also security guards surrounding the area. All cars and personnel passing by will be cross-examined. If you haven't received prior permission to enter, you'll be stopped. There have been attempts to enter made by university student groups. They've been thwarted several times. Whenever such incidents occur, they will reinforce their numbers, strengthening the guard. Breaking through directly is absolutely impossible. We need to find a highly improved, meticulous and skillful method. If you rush in willy-nilly, you won't get inside even a metre. Ajussi, leave. Ajussi, I'm asking you to leave. What is that guy doing? Let go! Let go of me! Come out, bastard! Come out! Shut him up first! Shut him up, you rascals! How can it be so noisy at the residence? - I told you to shut up, damn it. - What are you doing right now? And what are you doing? Are you the boss here? Never mind you. The boss is inside, isn't he? Today is his memorial day. Does that son of a bitch know? - Did he come unarmed? - Yes, Chief. - Let him go. 'Did he come unarmed?' Fuck, yeah. Why did you do such a thing? If it's for my father who died 26 years ago in Gwangju, does that give you a hint? This place isn't as you think, where you can do as you please. Is it? You're being rather rigid. I'll just end it here for today. Go report it clearly for me. Hyeong, I'll definitely come back to kill you. - You mustn't worry. Live well and wait-- - Punk! Throw him somewhere. Pardon? Hand him over directly to the police, right? Go throw him away. And this. It's his daily schedule confirmed up to now. Is it Gim Ju An? It's Gwak Jin Bae. I cleaned up the alley today. After taking a nap, I discovered - those guys had me-- - What are you able to see in your surroundings? - Here? - Yes. That... I can see a pointy thingamajig. It's hot. Come quickly. Oh fuck. My mouth is broken, I can't even taste the cigarette. Why didn't you have a disguise? Disguise? I'm not a child. We have to concentrate and proceed according to plan. Don't worry. I've taken care of things. - I heard that chairman is your father. - Yes. You come from such a good background too. Nice shot. Not matter what, the matter from a few days ago doesn't feel right. It's about time. The security should be strengthened. Do that. However, if we use the police force again, I'm afraid of public opinion. This time we have to look externally. Then see to it. The weather has improved. How about a trip to the countryside? As you wish, your excellency. Your excellency, Yes, public opinion. Public opinion. - What? - Why did you let that thug go? What a strange person. You make me do the same thing a second time. It'll be May soon. We have to try our best to avoid public discussion. It's better to be careful. Why are you so concerned with public discussion? The matter of discussion is tomorrow. Also, foreign external security is my jurisdiction. So don't get involved. Let's have a system. It hasn't been just one or two days. Don't act smart. It relates to the personal safety of his excellency. No, well... I just want to buy some books. I heard you worked really hard a few days ago. How was it hard work? It wasn't anything big. Oh my. This is the rifle used by athletes, eh? My, my, son of a gun. It seems you have something to say, so say it. I got it. Miss, I understand very well how you feel. Don't involve yourself in this. You're young. Aren't you in your 20s? You still have to live your life. My life has nothing to do with you. Nothing. It doesn't, but for you to do this, you're a bit... pretty. It's such a waste. I'm really grateful for your advice. I'm not disregarding you. As someone who's been through the same, I'm saying it because I see you like my little sister. For me, compared with those who've been through the same, those who died are more important. It's the same for you, isn't it? Surround him! Surround him! Surround him! What are you doing? Not bad. Such high standards, these thugs. It's just Mozart. Hey, An Su Ho. Where's Gwak Jin Bae? Jin Bae... Why are you looking for him? It's just the a life of intimidation. Even if he's thrown in prison, it's not the end. Who's the opposing party? The former president. Even without using a calculator, the answer should be apparent. Turn off the music. It seems you can hear what I'm saying now. Well then, hand over Gwak Jin Bae. Otherwise, you go and take the blame for him. Jin Bae... I sent him to buy cigarettes. =Jin Bae hyeong, Hyeongnim was taken away.= =What do we do? There's no place in Gwangju for use to stand now.= Did you get the cigarettes? No, I didn't buy them, Hyeongnim. Jin Bae... The thing that you have to do. Is that truly the only way? Whether it's the right path, honestly, I don't know. Even so, at least, not even had thought of that, I deserve to be in here. Up till now, I went through life without any thoughts. Now that I'm here, I feel I have sinned. Fuck. This life is truly shameful. - Hyeongnim. - Jin Bae. Don't look back. Look ahead and run with vigor. This building was purchased a few years ago for this. This individual will be helping Mi Jin later on. It's 600 metres ahead at 2 o'clock. It's like a maze. This is the most we can do. I haven't been coming every day. You were disappointed, weren't you? It's because I've had some things to do in Seoul lately. They say the days are getting better. Once I'm done, let's go back home. That person. The serviceman who killed your father. He came here not long ago. He came today as well. He asked me to forgive him, crying. However... I didn't cry. I only looked on. I didn't cry at all. Stop. Still like this at your age, jeez. My mother hasn't changed one bit. Hasn't changed a bit. Like the same fool every day. I brought the information mentioned last time. You've worked hard. It was difficult to obtain. Jin Bae's group received a huge blow. As expected, the prosecutors took direct action. We haven't heard anything in our department yet. There hasn't been a large operation yet. They're just sending a warning to others. They acted faster than anticipated and they're using public force behind the scenes. We need to be more agile in our operations. The person who killed my father was you? That's why you went to my poor mother, crying, fussing and all that. Asking for forgiveness. That's why you came to find me? You said it was to take revenge. You're only using the children of those you killed! Fuck! Just use them! Gwak Jin Bae! Stop it. Just like you, my father and I have lived worse than dogs. It's not just you alone. I didn't plan on hiding it. I just thought it wasn't the time to ask for your forgiveness yet. Although you'll find it laughable, I wanted to give an opportunity to you and to me. If you want to kill someone make a choice. Fucking. Why is it so complicated? Continuing like this, it is surely going to fail. What are you going to do? Kill him, of course. Miss Mi Jin, our aim isn't to kill. Our aim is to make them apologize. It seems like we've given him ample opportunity. It's been some decades. You said you've assisted in traffic signal management, right? Yes. But I'm no longer doing that. I ask of you just this once. It's simple. Just give me 5 seconds. A real son-of-a-bitch. Son-of-a-bitch. Me. My wife. My wife. They're all dead. What is that? It's because of your bang bang bang. Sons-of-bitches. As long as they're doing well. It's no matter if I live or die. Don't buy alcohol. You have to buy food to eat. After eating, then drink. Salute! Why are you here now? Aren't you on support? That... I said it was fine. No matter how I think about it, this method... this method doesn't seem like it'll work. =If there's a mistake, Mi Jin will be in danger and ours plans will fizzle out.= - =Jin Bae is closest to the area right now.= - Stupid woman. Fuck! =Departing immediately. Everyone wait in position.= =Departing now. 5 minutes before passing Seodaemun.= The police officers work hard every time. They'll be rewarded for their efforts occasionally, right? Yes. As I understand, the chief manages that. =This is the tunnel. 3 minutes till he passes. Please get ready.= =He's past the intersection. Please prepare the next signal.= =Seodaemun intersection, please get ready. 2 minutes before passing Seodaemun.= Are you hot? Why is such a young fellow sweating so much? No, I'm not. Hey, Gwon Jeong Hyeok. I heard you volunteered for the post today. Why is that? - Coming out here, aren't you a bit... - =About to pass through the Seodaemun intersection. Please change the signal.= =Please change the signal.= What are you doing, kid? =Seodaemun. Please change the signal.= - Quickly change the signal, punk! - =Please change the signal.= =He's passing Seodaemun now.= Ah. What are you doing! Miss! - Don't tell me... - What is that? Three. Four. Five. Damn! Just like that. No! Let go, punk! Hey! - Punk! - Don't go! One. Two. Three. Four. Just like that. - No! You can't! - Hey! You aren't letting go? You punk! Get out of the way! Are you insane? Let go, punk! Three. Four. It's a woman! Five! Six! Die. Die! Police, police. Don't move! You punk. - Go check if his excellency is safe. Quickly! - Yes. Go protect his excellency first. Quickly! Quickly, quickly! Damn! Damn! Stop right there! Gwon Jeong Hyeok. It's okay. It's okay now. What are you doing? Go quickly! Dad, I'm sorry. I'll stop here. Damn! You punk. Ju An. Leave it. You don't understand? It's not because of you. I'm doing this for myself, so that I can live. For me to live, I'll risk my life. Please don't stop me. We can't go back any more. Not in this manner! Starting now, in my way, I'll do it myself. No. You can't do it alone. Although matters have become complicated, there are sufficient odds. I'll take care of it. What do you know! Everyone, like you, has their own heartfelt reason. Although I may die in doing this, but you know we won't be able to live on if we don't do this. Damn! He's in front of me right now. - =Hey.= - I'll bring him over now. =This punk. So much nonsense! Just follow him.= Yes, salute. The news covered it right away last night. Gangs or whatever. Anyway, they really know how to spin it. What is that? Oh, wasn't he the one from yesterday? But he also came here not long ago. - Hey, hurry up and help. - Hey! Why are you up? You can't be up. You lost too much blood. You have to lie down. You should still be a bit dizzy. How is my hand? The woman who lost a lot of blood woke up. Are you left-handed? - No. - Oh, then that's good. Hungry, huh? We're ordering noodles with sauce. Do you want some? - Oh, that. - I find fried noodles to be the best. - Of course, hyeongnim. - Fried noodles with cheese. Plus complimentary dishes. Come out quickly, punks. Ah, you've studied abroad. Why is someone who's studied aboard so interested in the line of work of his excellency's security? Are you still not satisfied being number 1 in your industry? But up till now, I haven't served for the elites. I feel that this will help improve my corporate image. Right, you can't underestimate class. The economy hasn't been do so well lately, has it? Conveniently, I recently heard that they were strengthening his excellency's security. It's because there's been a rise in lunatics acting foolishly lately. We should really be taking action quickly, but there are simply too many security companies. - Sorry to disturb you. - It's no ordinary amount of competition. Son-of-a-bitch! You're courting death. So irritating, this madman. This is the type I like. I'm sorry, I was a bit late. This is your car key. So my car key was there. There are also a few boxes of apples prepared for you in the trunk. Apples? Apples are nice. Simple and traditional. I've also prepared a small gift for his excellency. The highly educated indeed stand out from the crowd. I like you. =The speech is about to begin.= =I ask our invited guests to get ready.= =Once again, the lecture is about to begin.= =I ask our invited guests to get ready.= For this era's greatest president, we will present our well wishes. Everyone, please come to the front. We wish you boundless longevity! Everyone, please return to your seats. Everyone, please return to your seats. -=Welcome: Lecture by the greatest president of our times=- Found it? Let me see. It doesn't look like there's any relationship between them. There are orders from above not to investigate. Hey, you can't smell it? Smell what? Look. Her mom. His dad. They died during 5.18. So what if it was 5.18? Oh, jeez. Ah, that's why Gwon Jeong Hyeok... Quiet, punk. It was also during 5.18 for his sister. That's why our superiors dissolved the special investigation group. Having a guilty conscience, man... Hey, have you found the vehicle from the intersection? No, we've been ordered to stop investigating. I didn't continue searching. You punk. What? It's a car registered under a different person. You don't have to search to know that. - Punk. - What? Secretly go about it under the pretense of an internal investigation first. Also, tell the person monitoring Gwon Jeong Hyeok to be careful not to let it get out, got it? Just rest. You really don't listen. Weren't you told to rest? Slide over. So this is it. Success would be likely using this type. It seems a bit complicated. It's said the shooting range of this thing is 800 metres. Eh. This looks like a modified M16. Then the aim should be good. It's crooked. - You're familiar with this. - Yeah. Being part of a gang, there are specialists responsible for teaching this. You weren't sacred. Everyone here is part of the gang. I'm not one to scare easily. Not being scared but scaring others. You've got some skill. I'm sorry. As long as you know. And also... Thank you. That too, as long as you know. Wow. This smile makes your imagination run wild! Eh, I should rather be an honest person. I suddenly want to be a good person. Jeong Hyeok, during this time... I wouldn't have joined you if I knew it would be like this. It's all messed up. Yes. I'm also very regretful it has come to this, but we haven't-- Please go and surrender. All of you. What? I'll do whatever I can to be reinstated. So please end it here. I'll wait for you at the police station. Hey, Gwon... He met up with someone, but I don't know who. See, I said it before. Anyway, don't lose him. Monitor him closely, got it? Good work. Chief Ma, let us investigate openly. If we openly investigate, they'll be caught immediately. We can't openly investigate. Do what it takes to proceed in secret. Then what will you have me do? You're concealing it, not letting us investigate openly. If anything happens, only my head is on the line. Pessimistically speaking, if I lose my head, will the owner of this place take responsibility? Jeez, this is so frustrating. What are you doing? You're here, Hyeong. Hello, Hyeong. Hey, make way. What's all this? You haven't been able to you. That's why we prepared some things and brought it over. Hyeong. The cigarettes... Let us buy some together. Not able to say anything good... Frankly speaking, aren't you short on manpower? What about Hyeongnim? Hyeong. We went to see him this morning. We should give Hyeongnim an opportunity. And all of us as well. - Isn't that so? - Yes, Hyeong. Jeong Hyeok has completely gone into hiding? Yes. That cowardly fellow. I wonder if he's going hungry. There's news from that side. A meeting date has been set. But because of the previous incident, the police are on high alert. Thus, there needs to be something to disperse the local police force that day. A large incident. I'll go too. I was going to go anyway, since I have an agreement. I made an agreement with the captain of the guard that I'd be sure to be back. But what about your escape route? Will you be able to get out safely without my looking after? Let's eat. I'm hungry. Hurry up and come over. Oh, hey. How is it? =I lost the car that Jeong Hyeok met up with.= - What? - =I lost it.= Hey, as a police officer, how could you lose it? - =I went to the restroom at the gas station and it was gone when I came out.= - Tsk, tsk, tsk. - It was Honam Expressway, right? - =Yes.= Then it might have headed to Gwangju. Come back here. =Come back? Oh, then I'll come back.= - What? - =Oh right. Gwon Jeong Hyeok is there, right?= - Yes, he's here. - =It seemed as though he didn't eat anything yesterday. I don't know if he's doing well.= =Are you listening? Hello?= I want this to succeed. My parents also died in Gwangju. I saw them die with my own eyes. My current father raised me. My life after that day... I'm not too clear about it. I just never thought about it. It looks like you're throwing everything in. Like me. It's the first time I've had good feelings for you. Hey, why aren't you eating? Have some first. What kind of punishment will I receive? I applied for sick leave for you. Don't worry. Just pretend you don't know anything and come to work. Got it? Who doesn't make some mistakes in life? That's life. Isn't it? Why you treating me so nicely? We're colleagues. Woman like to wander around. That's my mother. My father. Looking at it, there does seem to be a bit... Yeah. It feels like everyone is a family member. That there, and this here, really... A bit... Are you shaking? Cry your heart out, once at least. Later. Save it up first, and cry it all out at once. =The 26th anniversary for 5.18 democratic movement= =was attended by over 4000 people, from family members of victims and politicians,= =held at the 5.18 cemetery.= =Following the ceremony,= =Gwangju held a tribute to pay homage to those who died for democracy.= What is it? The car from the intersection that day. Didn't you say it was registered under a different person, kid? I investigated a bit. The car frequents this building. - ACF? - Yes. What company is this? Have you investigated? Yes, it's in the industry. It's a company know to be stable and upright. Their finances are also very solid. That's all? You should investigate the people. I wrote down the name. It's Gim Se... what was it? It's Gim Gap Se. The owner of the car is the president's secretary, Gim An Ju. =First, check the car at the entrance.= =Yes, I understand.= Go and check. Who are you? It's Gim Ju An from ACF, here for a scheduled interview. =It doesn't seem like you're on the list.= - Please check with your superiors. - One moment. Team Leader, do we let the ACF car in? =Let it in.= Yes, I understand. - Welcome. Chief Pak had notified us. - Yes. Please enter. Wait. Before entry, you need to undergo a simple inspection. Is there a problem? It's just routine. This way, please. Let's begin. There's nothing out of the ordinary. Please enter. What is that? It's a gift for his excellency. That also need to be opened and checked. Please open it for them to check. Open it. Hey, punk! You aren't letting go? Not closing it? How are you treating his excellency's guests? You dare to touch his excellency's gift without authorization? Seriously. I'm sorry. I apologize on their behalf, Mr. Chairman. Please come inside. Chief Ma, I'll make the assurance this time. Open the door. Shall I excuse myself so you can have a one-on-one meeting? You don't need to do that. No, no. I should let you talk freely. We'll talk again later. This way, please. Please wait here a moment. Attention. Starting now, listen well to what I say. Get your weapons out first. Put them on the floor. Quickly! What is he saying? Everyone keep in mind, even if you get hit, you can't use your knives. You can't make anyone get hurt. Do you understand? Just for today, we are not thugs. We are Gwangju's sons. You mustn't forget it! Mr. Chairman, please enter. Come to my office for a coffee? - It's okay. I'll wait here. - Okay. In a moment, anything you can see in your aim is a target. That is called giving it your all. I know. And when taking aim, I've done it countless times. - It's extremely accurate-- - Shh! When this was made, you'll unknowingly look at drawings. But this... it's a work of art! I'm very pleased. =Thank you, thank you.= =But you said you wanted to see me.= Please have a seat. Your toe is injured. You have a bandage because of that bit of pain. I spent 26 years. I experienced countless failures and furthermore, painful times. But thanks to you, I'm able to be here. I had to become the owner of a large company, because not everyone can see you, and I had to see you. I came today to hear your response. - 'You'? - 26 years ago today, May 1980 of this day, do you remember it? - What? - Your life or death rests on your attitude. This person... what old things from the past are you talking about? Wasn't that settled already? Listen well. That was self-defence by the servicemen. =And as I reported afterward, I unaware of it.= Self-defence of the servicemen. You were unaware. I was a martial law trooper. It was clearly your orders. Admit the facts and ask for forgiveness. =If you do that, nothing bad will happen.= I thought that matter had already ended quietly. You think it's over, but I'm not done yet. In order for you to sit in the throne of power, you trampled on innocent civilians. Using knives and guns to get to your position. However, 26 years later today, you haven't even said sorry. You seriously... I find it more and more disinteresting. - Disinteresting. - And I thought it was something important. What is it? There's a new security company called ACF, right? =Secretary Gim Ju An, Chairman Gim Gap Se.= =Today is the memorial for the tragedy. We felt uneasy, so we're moving out.= Hello? Hello? Chief Ma! Damn! Hey, step on it! Arrest them! Seal the entrance! What's the matter? Why the grave look? I told you not to learn from me, this kind of person... - You said it was disinteresting... - I said it had nothing to do with me. Because of your orders, I became your tool for killing people. What are you denying! This person... Just leave. Where on earth is Chief Pak? You who've done wrong, no apology, and living so well. This society... This society is ill. This fellow... I'm someone who's had special training. You think you could frighten me with just a handgun? =Listen well. Take care of all the ACF people. Take them all out.= - Everyone has their time. - Beg for forgiveness! You who have no sense of same. Gim Gap Se. I've already planned an escape for your safe withdrawal. I have no need for that. What's that? Those are cops. - Fuck. Catch up with them. - Step on it! Girl, you have to succeed! Are you two acquainted? Sorry, your excellency. Go do what you should do. And what is that? Sort out the study. It seems like the youth of late don't have good feelings for me. I hadn't even done anything to them. This is just the beginning. Hurry, get out. What happened to Chief Ma? He didn't reply over radio. Seal every corner! Please tune to frequency 88. Our country has become an extremely good country. Keep them out! - Hurry! - Where did that come from? It should be Gwak Jin Bae's people. Just a bit more. Long time no see. Charge! Some more people should be dispatched over here. Just a bit more. Got it. What is that? Fuck! Hurry up and charge!

We will deal with it post-haste.= The remote is broken, so there's no way to control it! Hey, can't you open the door? Chief Ma! Arrest all those thugs! How can you let thugs to run unbridled in the neighbourhood in broad daylight? Thugs. We are not thugs. Your men are the thugs. Understand? Don't shoot, don't shoot! Are you able to see? Have them all taken good care of. Wake up, Ma Sang Yeol! The one we have to protect isn't him. It's these kids. Your kids.

Sister you fucker. Police officer? Then tell me how you lived up to now. I lived like a dog! Don't police officers rescue citizens in dire straits? Is that murderer a good citizen? Is being the bodyguard of a murderer being a police officer? Wake up, Gwon Jeong Hyeok! Don't you feel ashamed? Are you able to answer to your sister? Chief Ma. Are you using that gun to shoot me now? Of course not. You can't die. You punk. You have to live shamelessly. Till the end. You have to ensure the legitimacy of my life. Understand? Your excellency.
