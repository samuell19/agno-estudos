Marriage is such an important thing. How can we be certain we want to wake up every morning next to the same person? You have everything you need to make a woman happy. But we're still young. Paul, don't be mad at me for this, but I don't feel ready for marriage yet. You understand, don't you? Absolutely. DOMEC DATING AGENCY Guess who! Someone who's poking my eyeball! -How are you? -As happy as a socialist. So, how did it go with your fiancee? She hasn't moved since the war, covered in cobwebs, and yet, she's being fussy. You go to meet them, not to marry them! Honestly! Rejected by an old, rotten-smelling woman, how depressing! Paul, I need you. Mom! I have all this paperwork to do! These books won't keep themselves! Liberal professions are booming. Put your bow-tie back on. And hurry up! The client won't wait. We… we had an appointment? Yes. Doctor Paul Martin. -Barbara Penning. Nice to meet you. -And you. We should sit down. You're a doctor? Uh, yes, no, uh… Yes, Doctor Paul Martin. And you? -No, I'm not a doctor at all. -That's okay. -Are you… American? -No. British? -Sorry, it's not my fault. -That's not a problem. I must warn you, I'm not good for business. Sorry? For a doctor, I mean. I'm in good health, I never get sick. Oh, I see… Have you been trying to get married for long? You're the first one I've met. -What do you want in a woman? -Well, uh… She has to be a woman, I mean, a real woman. Oh? Are there fake women? No, no, but some women are, uh… What would your ideal woman be like? Well, first of all, I'd want her to be smart… -Hi! -Pretty… And she must like kids. So, you want to get married to have kids. -No, no, no! -You alright? Yeah. How's your article going? Well, I met a sad little doc with lots of issues. That's normal! A self-confident, happy guy wouldn't sign up with a dating agency. Yeah, I know, but I feel uncomfortable putting on an act for all these lost souls. You're too sentimental. It'll be your downfall! I just feel sorry for them. You weren't hoping to meet Paul Newman, were you? Do you know the story of the little coffee? -No. -In its underwear? -What? Why? -No, forget it. Wait, here's another: Vivo and Viva are putting on hair products. Viva's a girl, okay? That's very important. What product does Viva put on? "Vivagel", of course! No, you probably don't get it, you're not French. It's from a TV ad. It doesn't work with another brand name. I've got one: Why don't Chinese women ever use this finger? Because it's your finger! No, no, it's very funny! But I already knew that one. -Are you religious? -Yes, but I don't practice. Same for me with riding a bike. I believe I can, but I don't practice. Are your parents still alive? My mother, especially! Tell me about yourself. Do I interest you that much? What do you want to know? Everything. Hey, miss! This is my spot. Excuse me, miss. That's my spot. Do you have ten dimes on you? That's my spot! Maybe four quarters, or 20 nickels? I said, that's my spot! It was your spot, but that's in the past. Now, think about the future. Be nice, go get some change and put it in the machine, or I'll get a ticket. Thanks in advance! Another bouncing check won't do! Guess who! Stop it! You know, love at first sight is quite rare. Well, Doctor Paul Martin is very nice, and funny too. But… I understand. Alright, then. I'll introduce you to a man who's elegant, very classy, a great guy: Julien Duchemin. Sorry I'm late, but-- I couldn't find a parking spot. Really? I was lucky. I found one right away! You thinking about what you'll get me for my birthday? -No, about whether God exists! -Oh. And what's your conclusion? It's got pros and cons. Hello, everyone. -Well, lovebirds? All good? -As good as socialists. Got anything for me this morning? Life insurance? -No, it's quiet. -Come on, check. A little mutual fund? No, you crook. Zilch! Oh, times are hard. Well… Anyway, I trust you. If there's talk of marriage, call me to tell me the names! As usual. Same goes for you. Once you're done with this loser, and you want to know real love, give me a call. -I'll think about it. -Alright, see ya! That kid's pretty nice. But he might bite. -We don't need to take both cars. -You're right. We'll take mine. I get scared when I'm not driving. Oh, shit! Who's the asshole who did that? It was me. -What? -Sorry, but it felt so nice. Really? In that case, we better take your car. I guess. Was that Ms. Penning leaving? Did she mention me? Don't worry, she thought you really were a doctor. Right, sure, but… As a man? No. No, nothing special. "Nothing special." Even if she did, you wouldn't tell me. You've always stuck your nose in my love life! -Calm down! -I won't calm down! I'm sick of this! I'm suffocating here! I'm an accountant, a sidekick, play dress-up. For once, I meet someone else than an old bag, and you butt in! Want to keep me for yourself? Just tell me! Until what age? Until I'm 60? Want me to tell you what she said? "Very sweet, but not love at first sight." What do you know? Were you there, on our date? I could feel something was happening, I was there! And maybe it's love at first sight, but slightly delayed! That does exist! She'll call me and ask to go out together. She'll say she's in love with me, and I can marry her whenever! -Why not? -Why not? No hesitation, I'll agree right away! How about in the meantime, you go back to work, okay? In the meantime. In the meantime! So, you have no family in Paris at all? I don't have any in London anyway, so definitely not here! -You're a poor immigrant worker. -Especially the immigrant part. Like them. Poor things, so far from Africa. Sorry, sir, it's my first time here. I can't find the exit. Thank you. -Look how cute! -Let it go! Let go! -What's the matter with you? -You're completely oblivious! -I had the same stuffed animal as a kid. -That one's not stuffed. Good day, I'm Captain Paul Martin. Nice to meet you. -May I ask you a question? -Sure. Just because, I thought… Well… Normally, given the way you look, you shouldn't have any trouble getting married. Neither should you! No, it's not the same. Where do you think you are? Excuse me? If a waiter drops your steak at a restaurant, does he put it back on the plate? No! Would you eat meat that's been trailing on the floor? -No. -Then, why did you give it to him? Next time, you're fired. I'm warning you. Yes, sir. I'm so sorry, but I can't stand incompetence. Wait, this place is yours? -This is yours? -Yes. That's incredible! See that one? I practically bottled-fed him. Now, that's something I'd love to do! "Dear Barbara." "Upon reflection, it appeared clear to me that we have many things in common." What about your second wife? Such an extraordinary woman, like a young girl on the inside. Why? Was she an old ruin on the outside? Not at all. On the contrary. I killed her. -You killed her? -Yes. -Do you like bouldering? -What's bouldering? Mountain climbing. I told her I didn't want her to come, I wanted to go alone. She wasn't very athletic, so she lost her grip. -"Lost her grip?" -She slipped. You mean, she broke her neck. Yes. She fell and landed 300 feet below. Down 300 feet? Perhaps 500 feet, actually. What a horrible accident! How incredible! I killed her. No! No, it must have been fate. You weren't meant to be together for long. No, no. I know it's my fault. More champagne? "Please know that I'm thinking of you, just as you're thinking of me." "Love, from Paul Martin." What are these for? Hara Kiri? Not at all. They're Moroccan daggers. -From Tarfay. -You can still commit suicide with them. Sure, you can try. It may be the champagne, but… -But what? -No, forget it. It's ridiculous. That's not fair. When you start a sentence, you have to finish it. Can you feel how peaceful it is here? Yet, at the same time, extremely tense. Nature has a strange alchemy to it. Confusion and contradiction. I know there's no hope… Oh, well… I love you. Yes, I love you. I want to marry you. Yes, I do. Barbara… do you take… Yes! -I don't have money for the church! -What? No, it's nothing. Come on! Don't sleep in just because it's Saturday! What? I'm getting married! Have you been drinking again? I met a great guy, really attractive. He wants to marry me, so why not? Is he any good? I don't know, we just talked all night. You won't be having much fun, then. He's very unhappy. -He needs me. -Well, you know, marriage… You should try it at least once in life. After all, that's what divorce is for! Look at me! A letter came in for you. Hello? No, uh, yes! That's me. Did I wake you? No, it's Barbara. Not at all. I was about to go to the hospital. Absolutely! Anywhere you want! This afternoon? Around three p.m. at Montsouris Park. Okay, see you then. What's wrong? Are you sick? -No, I'm fine. -Why are you going to the hospital, then? Why would I go there? I didn't say it, you did! I'll go to the hospital when I'm sick! I'm fine now, so let's drop it! -Catherine. -Yes? Catherine. -Yes, honey? -No, no. Don't interrupt me. I have to tell you something, it's not easy. What's wrong? Okay, I've met an incredible woman and I want to marry her. -Barbara! -Doctor! -I'm glad to see you. -Me too! I thought he was going to eat me! Scram! Go on, beat it! I'll never let anyone hurt you. -Paul? -Yes, Barbara? -I have something important to tell you. -Great, so do I. I'll go first. I'm not who you think I am. Neither am I. I'm a journalist for the Daily Mirror. Well, that I'm not. I met with you because I was investigating how French people feel about marriage. Right, and that's how you meet the love of your life. -Yes! You understand? -Absolutely! No, Paul. I'm afraid you didn't understand me. How can I explain it? It's hard, yet so simple… I've met someone who doesn't have all your qualities, but… How should I say this? Well, dammit! I'm getting married! There. I'm so sorry. I hope I haven't caused you too much pain. No, no, on the contrary! What luck! I came here to tell you that… well, you should stop fantasizing about me because I too… I've met a girl, uh… a bit older than you… who speaks French without an accent, who barely speaks at all, she's mute and great, and… she's asked me to marry her. And I said yes. There. How can I explain, physically? How to tell you, physically? -Do you know the Pompidou Center? -Yes. Well, she lives next to it. BARBARA PENNINGTEN AND JULIEN DUCHEMIN ARE GETTING MARRIED Waiter, give me another! Come on, champagne for everyone, my treat! Today, my wife is getting married. -Who's there? -It's me, Paul. What are you doing here? One, to ask for forgiveness, and two, to make love. Hi, Martial. Hi, Paul. You alright? As happy as a socialist. Just stop me if I'm wrong here… My fiancee and you… -It's going pretty well? -Very well, yes. Well, I'm very happy. For you. I'm very happy for her. I'm happy for Barbara Penning, happy for her husband. I'm happy for everyone. The Duchemins, what a couple! She's fantastic. I don't know him, but he must be an idiot. A real idiot. My company got in real trouble for getting them life insurance. Let him eat dirt! No, seriously! He was widow twice. Each time, he made a fortune. Yeah… What's wrong with him? Forgive me, I wasn't myself yesterday. What were you saying about Duchemin? What? He killed his first two wives? I didn't say that, but seems he's pretty unlucky. Your company's unlucky. His wives cost the company half a billion in ten years. How did they die? Accidents. The first, drowning, the second, mountain climbing, 300 feet, 9,000,00 bucks. Here. That's a lot per foot! What the…? Accidents. The first, drowning, the second, mountain climbing, 300 feet, 9,000,00 bucks. -Must make a lot of money. -What? Your boss must be stinking rich. More like a bottomless pit! Really? Know how much it costs to feed these beasts? No idea. Well, in restaurants, a tiny rib steak already costs a fortune, so… Well, here, we have over 200 animals to feed! How does your boss manage? He doesn't! He's just gone to Morocco with his wife, fine. But if he can't get 9,000,000 bucks, he can say goodbye to all this. And we'll be unemployed! -Did you say 9,000,000? -Yeah. Where in Morocco? No, Paul, you're not going! Mom, I'm sick of you telling me what I can or can't do! I'm 33 years old! Exactly! That's the age when you make mistakes! Look at Christ! Stop your bullshit! He's going to kill her! He needs 9,000,000 bucks, he needs the insurance money! Just like his other wives. Things always come in threes! Paul! Hiya! -Julien. -Yes? -I'm scared. -Of what? Because I'm too happy. Well, enjoy it because it's not going to last. -I'm not kidding. -Neither am I! What a varied landscape… I'm dying from this heat! You're unbelievable, nothing's good enough for you! Morocco's too hot, Saint-Tropez is too crowded, Tahiti's too far. -I give up. -Don't use that tone with me! Come on, give it a rest already. What's going on? I think it broke down. -No! -Yes. Could you go back to the city and send a tow truck? -Not a problem. -Thank you. This holiday's off to a great start! We can't just leave them here. I just couldn't stand them. If I hadn't gotten rid of them, I don't know what I would have done. And I wanted to be alone with you in the desert. Really? What's that lake over there? -What lake? -That one, there. That's not a lake, honey, it's a mirage. -Want me to prove it? -Yes! Mrs Duchemin, please. -Duchemin? -Yes. -Room 256. -Yeah? They've gone out. I have to know where they went. -Ask the tourism office. -The tourism office? Hello, I'm looking for Mr and Mrs Duchemin. Duchemin! -They went to the desert. -Right. What? All alone? That's mad! We never send people alone. They went with another couple. I see. That's better. The engine's dead. -Is it a real breakdown? -Yes. It's not cars they lend you, it's junk. But don't worry, I've got it all under control. We'll die out here like rats. No, I'm just kidding. So… We're right here. There's a village an hour away. I'll go there and come back with some help. In the meantime, you stay here and enjoy a suntan. -What a nice beach! -No, seriously. Protect yourself from the sun as best you can, And drink water regularly. -Even if you're not thirsty. -Okay. I'll be back in about an hour and a half or two hours. -See you later. -Yes. -Behave! -You too. Bye! Are you here alone too? What kind of a question is that? No, I didn't mean anything by it. I'd like to play tennis, but I'm alone… You should win easily, then. I played alone this morning and yesterday, I'm a bit bored of it now. I'd like to play tennis. Just watch TV, then. -Do you know how to play? -Miss, quick! Quick, quick! You must send a tow truck right away! The Duchemins broke down 42 miles out there! -They're alone in the desert? -Yes. Couldn't you wait for me? -Honey-- -I'm so sick of you! -Where are they? -On route 510. Honey, listen to me! I don't have a car. Can I rent one? -If you like, I can lend you mine. -Thanks! Which one is it? He's going to kill her. He's going to kill her, that bastard! Dammit! Hey, wait! That's the wrong car! Wait! A Land Rover and a tow truck… Are they still far? -The sun's hitting hard today. -Yeah… A woman's dying back there! Your wife's dying back there, and you're running this way? She's not my wife. What do you care, then? No, listen… I have to go get the car to bring it back to that woman. So, to go there, you're going that way? Look, I won't ask why you've got a bandage on your head! Take me that way! What's that? -Camel! Camel! -Yeah, it's a camel. Over there! How do you turn this thing? Can't we go any faster? You know, boss… those who go faster, end up faster in their grave. There! The Jeep! Shit! Barbara! Hey, boss! Over there, boss! There! I knew it! That rotten bastard! How's it going, lovebirds? Water, quick! Give me a hand. -Where's the nearest hospital? -Just the infirmary in Ouled Said. Is that far? -Drive back to the route. -Okay. Then, head south. It's two hours by camel, you can't miss it. -What about by car? -Same. Right… Boss? Hey, boss. If you don't plug that red wire back in, the car won't start. -Where does it go? -Let me do it. There. You can go now. Thanks. Have a nice holiday! Sure, thanks. If you'd found her two hours later, she'd be dead. It's okay, Barbara, the nightmare's over now. Doctor, where am I? -Where's Julien? -You almost died, but you're fine now. Am I in Paris, or are you in Morocco? In Morocco. I came to save your life. But… Where's Julien? He left you for dead, out in the desert. He died while getting help? You don't want to admit it! -Julien! -No, please! Calm down! -Julien! -Someone help! -Julien! -You need to calm her down. Yes, some Valium… My wife… I left her in the desert. Please save her. Yes, yes. My car broke down. I left my wife in the desert. Paul… Yes? Tell me the truth. Has something bad happened to Julien? No, no. The only bad thing that's happened to Julien is that… Do you understand what I'm saying? -That's Julien! -I said my car broke down! -What? -That's Julien. -You have to go now! -That's impossible! I left my car in the desert! My wife's out there! -Are you Julien Duchemin? -Yes! Let him go. We found your wife. -Is she…? -She's here. Julien! Julien! Barbara! I got lost, you know? I got lost! -What a great actor. -Really? He's an actor? I don't know. I heard you call him an actor, that's all. I doubt it! I never say the word "actor". Like "shut your cake hole!" I never say that. Or "balls!" -Does she have to stay long? -In 48 hours, she'll be good as new. Right. He'll just have to try again. -Hello, sir. -Hello, miss. -Hello. How are you? -Fine, thank you. Enjoy your tennis. -Thanks. -Gotta flirt with all of 'em? -Hey-- -That big grin you gave her! -Not a single room? -Sorry, sir. The hotel is fully booked. I'll take anything. A tiny room, a closet, anything! You've received a letter. No, it's actually for Duchemin, the room next door. When do you leave? At the end of the month. Why? No reason. -How about some tennis? -Sure! Get it! -Hey, can I play? -Aw, come on! Sorry! No, maybe the net's too high. No… I just play badly. No, it's your backhand. You're doing it wrong. Wait, I'm teaching him something. You're blocking your move. Don't stop it like that. Here, look. Steel yourself, and you get lots of strength. See? Oh no, I'm so sorry! No, it's alright. It's my fault. Try the sauce. -Here. -No. That's kind of you, but my stomach's feeling a bit funny. Are you nuts? It's harissa paste, it's very mild. Go on! It's good. -You alright? -I'll be fine. It's probably the couscous. It probably wasn't fresh, that happens a lot. I made a new friend on holiday once too. We met in Paris, but I never saw him again. Sad, isn't it? But we'll meet again for sure. What's going on? The starter's busted. You push the car and I'll steer. Is that okay? Of course, Paul. Go on, push. Hey! -Push! -Yeah, but… I said push! Watch out! Why d'you jump under the car? You okay? Is the car alright? When you get back to Paris, I'd love it if you called, so we can meet up. My parents have a nice country house in Orly. Sure, sure. -Enjoy your holiday! -You too. You're very lucky, you know? "Where there's a will, there's a way." Saint-Exupéry said that. What kind of treatment did you get to heal so quickly? They added salt. I don't know why, but my salt levels were low. That's normal. Too much sun caused too much perspiration. Thus, loss of sodium. So now, you need shots to replaced the lost sodium. Without you, I'd be a widow by now. You'd do the same for me. If you found my wife in the desert. Since she's not yours, you save her. -Are you a doctor? -No. I've just been sick a lot. -He's a doctor. -Really? That reflex of yours is very honorable. I didn't know you and Barbara were acquainted. No, yes… We crossed paths once or twice in Paris. Three! Three? I'm no good with numbers. But when I saw you lying in the desert, I thought, "Hey, I know that face!" How lucky you were passing by! Yes! I love off-road adventures. I love going off-trail when I'm skiing, so in the desert, it's all I do! What the hell is this? How awful! Is this melon? My dress is ruined! We're still recovering, so please excuse us. Could I thank you with a kiss? Uh, sure. You're a bit prickly. -Good night. -Good night. -See you tomorrow. -You're not prickly at all! -See you tomorrow. -If God wills it. That guy's good. He's really good. Why didn't you tell me you were a doctor? -But I-- -Say, while I have you here… Some doctors claim injecting living cells to fight the aging process is dangerous for the organism. Be honest, what do you think? -Well, there are pros and cons… -Sure, but I mean-- Listen, the best way to stay in shape is to sleep for 14 hours. So, that's what I'll do. Good night! Sleeping for 14 hours… He's not here by chance, that's clear. Sure, he is. He told me he was here to look after the king's sick cousin. He's the sick one. He's in love with you! It's as clear as the mustache under his nose. Come on, he doesn't think he can flirt with me on my honeymoon. He's very, very sick. Wait for me here. How much is it? For you, a special price: 350. You say 350? Come on, 225! -No, 300! -Come on-- I don't want it anymore! Everything's too expensive when it's for me. Come on, honey! -Do you have any Tarfayas? -Yes. -Could I see them? -What's a "Tatafya?" No, "Tarfaya". You know, my collection of Berber daggers. -Here. -It's magnificent. Sure, but it's not a Tarfaya. Doctor. Other doctors have prescribed me this medicine to sleep better, but it's not working. -How long have you been taking them? -Five to six weeks. Triple the dose. Thank you, Doctor. How much do I owe you? Nothing, it's fine. …because I can feel that-- No, no thanks. -No, I'm not interested. I'm a Taurus. -Doctor! I can feel I'll need a prescription for my intestine, I don't know what I ate… -Sir! Do you have any "Tatafya?" -"Tatafya?" -Yes. -No. Come over here, I've got some pretty necklaces at good prices. -No, I want "Tatafya"-- -Barbara! You never should have married him! I know, but what can I do? It's too late now. But he's dangerous! Please divorce him, it's a matter of life and death! -I'll take this one. My husband will pay. -But-- Barbara! -She's not my wife! -That's my necklace! -Pay me 1,500 dirhams. -What! Julien! Hey, you were right. That doctor's really sick. See? I told you. It's worthless plastic! Alright, alright, let's discuss this. -I have an idea. Let's make a deal. -Right. Give me half of it now and the rest right away. Okay? Good evening. We're neighbors? Looks like it. Funny coincidence, isn't it? You got that right. See you later, at dinner? No, not tonight. -Good night. -Good night. -Honey. -Yes? How do you want your eggs? Soft-boiled! Do you want jam or honey? Jam. -Peach, plum, or pear? -Plum! Oh my God! What are you doing here? I heard a scream, so… -I banged my knee. -Get the hell out! -Are you sure you don't need help? -You've done enough! Get out, I'm naked! -I'm a doctor, so I've seen-- -Get out! Alright, alright! I heard a noise, so I hurried over. But everything's fine. Well, good night! Good night. What's gotten into you? Nothing, just a crab. I'm an idiot! Why am I such an idiot? An idiot! What an idiot! You saved my life, you know. -Stop exaggerating. -I'm not, I assure you. That little black crab was a scorpion. If it had stung me, I'd be dead in two minutes. You'd have screamed and our neighbor would have rushed over. I'm begging you, don't talk about that guy. I can't stand him. He'd rush in through the door. -He's not a bad guy. -But he's clingy. Will he be like this during our whole trip? At least, not tomorrow. -Do you have a pencil? -Not on me. Just a minute. Hello. Shit, my camera! -After you. -Thank you. Hey! Before we got married, you'd let me go first. Come on, honey… -I told you he wouldn't come. -Well done. -Hello, sir. -Hello. -It's 8:30 a.m. -Thank you. What? -Doctor! Thanks to you, I slept so well. -That's great to hear. Doctor, wait for me! Doctor! -Is the waterfall tour group gone? -Yes, sir. -What's wrong? -Do you have any money? -Yes, uh-- -We'll take a cab. Come on, hurry! Wait for me! -Hurry up! -Alright, alright! Can you imagine? You go on holiday and come back as a corpse! How awful! What'd he say? -I don't know, I'm British. -Oh? He says there's an accident here every week. When I have to stand, my legs swell up. When I sit down, my back seizes up. You won't fit any more! And as soon as I lie down, I feel a lot of pressure. Yes, me too! You look amazing! I'll take a photo of you from here, it's magnificent. Come here. -Hurry up! -Alright! Smile! I can't, the sun's in my eyes. Professor Blas made me do thousands of x-rays, but found nothing. Nothing at all! Doctor! Wait for me! You're right! It's much prettier from up here. Wait, step back a little, so I can get the whole view. Like this? Yes, but a little more to the right. How do I know if I have a tumor, Doctor? -Get an autopsy! -An autopsy? No! Look out! Doctor, wait for me! Let go of me! Doctor! A bit further. Does it look nice? Amazing! Look out! Just a little more. Watch out! What's going on? But… you were about to fall! -I'll kill him. -No, Julien! -No! -I have to, it'll calm me down. There are other ways to calm down! -I'll kill him. -That's not a solution! -She's right! -I have to, it'll calm me down. No! How about a slap? Just a little slap! You see? Feels nice, doesn't it? Do you feel better now? Yes, that made me feel better. That's funny, it made my ear hurt. -Forgive me, I really had to. -That's alright. Yeah, but without me-- -Don't start that again! -I didn't say anything! -Stop moving, you'll hurt yourself. -It already hurts! Careful, now. -What happened to you? -She slipped! We need a doctor, but finding one in this dump… Allow me, I'm a doctor. Let me see. -Does it hurt if I press here? -Yes! Right, it's her ankle. The ankle. So, we'll put her in the minivan and I'll… wrap a bandage around it. Sensitive, isn't it? That's normal. It's full of bones and all that… Ligaments, arteries, veins… It's crazy how much is in there. You'd never guess, very tricky. Right, well… In 48 hours, you'll run like a hare! Thanks, Doctor. -After you, darling. -You could ask if I enjoyed myself. -Did you enjoy yourself? -No. -Could you please send in a nurse? -Yes, sir. You're a doctor? Yes. Well, I'm more of a pediatrician, really. Hello. The nurse can't come in today. Luckily, our friend can give you your shot. -That's so kind of you. -Well, if I can help… I'm terribly sorry for earlier. -It's fine, don't mention it. -Okay. When you're ready… I would but I don't have any syringes or equipment… You've got everything ready. Great, otherwise I wouldn't… be able to give you your shot… This is a great one! You get some fantastic results with this super famous product. Professor Hubert developed this one… in 1958. De Gaulle came into power then, while Hubert was in his lab at… uh, Roquette Street, working hard on developing this product… which is super famous, and we'll use to give you your shot. Great product… Would you rather have it intravenous or intramuscular? I don't mind, I can do either way. The nurse yesterday gave me the shot in my butt. Let's not change your habits, then. Can you hold that for me? -You're bleeding! -It's nothing, it's part of the job. You'll see, you won't feel a thing. It's easy, you just fill it up like a pen. It's very simple, I just need a hand. I'd prefer it if you left. I hate it when people read over my shoulder in the subway, When I give shots, I hate it even more. -Okay, then… Let's do it. -Yes! -Wouldn't you prefer it in the arm? -No. Oh, wait, there's no rubbing alcohol. There. -Ready? -Yes. You won't feel a thing. Won't feel a thing… If you keep rubbing, you'll rub my skin off! Well, it's necessary. What's wrong, Paul? You're acting strange. No, no, I'm fine. Let's do it. -Yes. -Let's do it. -What are you waiting for? -I can't do it. I can't do it! I'm not a doctor! This isn't the time for games. I'm not playing games, I'm just a shitty, worthless accountant, in love with someone out of my league. You're not Doctor Paul Martin? No, I'm Paul Domec, the son of the woman who introduced you to your husband. That's not good. I know. I thought you were sweet. But you've been making fun of me. No… But I'm not the only one who isn't what they seem to be. What does that mean? -Your husband isn't who you think he is. -You're obsessed! -I've never killed anyone! -What are you insinuating? -You'll be his third victim! -Are you crazy? Get out! He tried to kill you in the desert with a Jeep! Right, and today, he tried to throw me off a mountain! -Yes, he tried to push you! -You're jealous! You like me but can't stand that I married someone else. No, he's going to kill you and make it look like an accident! -For 9,000,00 bucks! -Get out of here! I'll keep protecting you anyway! Get out, Zorro! I don't need you! -He'll kill you by the end of the week! -I better enjoy these days, then! Just look at him! I just feel a bit sorry for him. Don't you? I'll go. Does she turn you on? -No. -Why are you looking at her, then? I don't know, I'm just looking. It's nothing. -Let's go for a swim. -No, we just ate. You have to wait. Thanks! I saw you were struggling, so I came to help you. Do you know how to hike? -"Hike?" -Yes. Well, I go on hikes once in a while, sure. -Oh, you mean balance the boat? -Grab that rope. Keep your legs straight, okay? -Keep your body parallel to the water. -No worries! So, you say I want to kill my wife. You think I'm an assassin. -Don't you? -I didn't say that. Why did you tell my wife I'd kill her? It was just a joke! Let's head back, you want to return the boat on time! We can take five minutes. You have to pay for every extra hour! It'd be dumb to pay an extra hour for just five minutes! That extra hour's on me, you're my guest. You see, if I were an assassin, I could drown you right now. Accidentally, of course. Right, but you're not an assassin! That's what I wanted to hear! Hiking sure is fun, isn't it? Honestly, do you really think I want to kill my wife? Not at all, on the contrary! Well, you're wrong. I will indeed kill Barbara. And I must kill you too because you know too much. But don't worry, it'll look like an accident. Watch your head! Who would do my company's accounting if you hadn't 'undrowned' me? -Come on, just forget it already. -My poor mom! If I were you, I wouldn't have saved my life! If a guy loved my wife and called me an assassin, I'd let him drown! Do you know why I wanted you to be a jerk? No. I hated you for marrying her, even though I saw her first! I'm very sorry. Don't be sorry, I had no right. I'd have done the same. He's much more handsome than me. You're not so bad. Sure, if you say so. But my beauty's not as classic as yours. But you're handsome on the inside. You're handsome everywhere! Okay, I'm going to go. No! Why? I feel like a third wheel! -I hope I didn't ruin your honeymoon. -No, on the contrary! The key for room 254, please. Don't forget, dinner tonight is on me! -Sure. See you at nine o'clock? -Yes, at nine. I'm really sorry. Doctor! It's getting worse! What can I do about it? You have to let it heal on its own. TWO MORE DEATHS ON ZIZ ROAD Could you connect me to the Air France reservation desk in ten minutes? Thank you. You scared me! I didn't hear you come in. Sorry. It's fine, I'm just being silly. In the end, your guardian angel is quite a nice guy. Very friendly. -Yes? -Air France reservations. How can I help? Yes, hello. Uh, hello… Yes, that's me. Air France reservations. How can I help? No kidding! That's wonderful! How much? -Hello? -Three? You want three seats? What destination? Casablanca? Casablanca? Which flight do you want? Of course, I'm interested! Sorry? You bet! I'll be in tomorrow. -The 8:20 or 11:15 flight? -At 10:00 a.m. No, there's a flight at 8:20 or at 11:15. That's great, the 10 a.m. flight. And thanks again. See you tomorrow. A Moroccan banker wants to invest three million in my animal reserve! That's great! So, I'll go see him tomorrow morning in Casablanca. Terrific! I'll come with you. It might not be a fun trip, you know? That's okay, I want to be with you. Me too, but I'm worried you'll be bored to death. I'll just watch you. I never get tired of watching you. Wouldn't you rather stay here, relax by the pool? No. The mayor said a wife must always follow her husband. Sure, but he wasn't Muslim! ATLAS TOURIST ROUTE If she's looking for a fight, she'll get one! -Cut it out… -Sure, go ahead and defend her! Alright, I'm going for a swim. -Yeah, go look for that whore of yours! -Come on, drop it. Sir, sir! -Buy my rock, sir! -No, thanks. Give me a cigarette, sir! Me, sir! I want one! Let's pretend we're on a desert island after a shipwreck. -What about Julien? -Julien? I don't know… -He's dead. Drowned, for example. -Poor thing! Yeah, it's no fun but that's how it is! Poor little darling, such a handsome man. I wonder how I've survived before meeting him. By breathing through your nose, like everyone else. I do hope you'll meet the man of your life one day. I'm not looking forward to that. -I mean, the woman! -That's much better. But I've already found her. No! -Sorry! -It's okay. -You get a kick out of stealing husbands? -Excuse me? Stop flirting with my husband! I don't understand. -Sure, play innocent. -But I swear, I-- That bitch! -She's crazy! -Are you insane? Hey, did you just call my wife a bitch? Yeah, why? Sorry, I have to pretend to yell at you, or she'll be pissed at me again. You bastard! I forbid you to speak to my wife like that! Thanks. It makes you wonder why some people get married. Especially since it's so nice to live with someone you love. Is that so? To your love! -How did everything go? -Wonderfully. -You've got some dirt on you. -Where? Right there. Oh, yes. -Did you have a nice day? -Yes, we washed up on a desert island. Yes, but all completely innocent. I see, you're not bored when I'm gone. I like it better when you're here. Well, I wasn't wasting time either. -Did you get the money? -Yes, it's all settled. That's wonderful! And the Moroccan man told me where to get more Tarfayas. You know, the daggers. Yes. Did you buy some more? No. I'd like to go with you tomorrow, it's not too far. Are you busy? -No. -Paul? -Come with us. -No, I've bothered you enough as it is. Paul, you're coming with us, that's an order! Alright, fine. "Sidi Abdou, "you access the Berber village by driving down a road that overlooks the Ziz Valley." Yes, it's the road we took to go to the waterfall the other day. -Yes, sir? -I asked you for a squeezed orange. -Yes, sir. -Then, bring me a squeezed orange. That is a squeezed orange, sir. No, this is orange juice, not a squeezed orange. Sir, I assure you that it is a squeezed orange. I've been drinking squeezed orange for 40 years, so I know the difference between a squeezed orange and orange juice. But sir, I can assure you I squeezed that orange myself earlier. Listen, I want a freshly squeezed orange, not from the fridge! Please excuse me. Sir! -Where's the chef? -There. -Are you the chef? -Yes. -Is this a squeezed orange? -Excuse me? Aren't you funny! If a guy threw his drink right in my face, I'd throw my fist right into his. But you… You didn't study at culinary school. It must have been coward school. Thanks for that! Freshly squeezed, not from the fridge! Go ahead without me, I'm not in a state to go out. I'll stay by your side, my love. Paul, could you please pass me that map? Now, you can't miss it, it's easy. It's the first right turn after the tunnel. The tunnel near Sidi Abdou. We're not in a hurry. We can go once you feel better. Do it for me! I can't say no to you. Kiss me. Goodbye, my love. See you later. We should get going. See ya. Bye. -Turn right! -No need to shout! -Right! -Okay, I'm not blind! Would you be interested in a desperate guy? It depends on who. -I don't know… Someone suicidal? -I love people who commit suicide! I think there's nothing more beautiful than a successful suicide! -Get behind the wheel. -What are you up to? Go on, step on the gas! You have to put your head right under the wheel, or you'll just end up paralyzed. Oh, right. Okay, got ya! Go ahead, Barbara! I wish you lots of happiness! I don't know how to drive! Miss, got a cigarette? Sorry, I don't smoke. -In the glove box. -No, I said-- Yes! Here! The man took it out from there yesterday. What man? But this isn't the road to Casablanca, is it? No, Casablanca's the other way, silly! But… Why would Julien tell me he was going to Casablanca? The fake breakdown! Damn, we've broken down! So, he came by here yesterday with the car. The breakdown's over, I plug it back in and off we go. That's how I fixed your Jeep in the desert. The engine wasn't dead? No! The car broke down because of all the potholes. The cable was detached. Julien said it was because the engine was dead. I don't know, he didn't see the cable and thought-- But… why did he lie to me? Turn around, I have to go back and talk to him now! No, we said we'd go buy those "tar-thingies." There's something weird about this. Hey, look out! Dying with you would be pure joy! We're not in a hurry! -What are you doing? -What's going on? I can't do anything! You're insane! You almost killed us! You dangerous madman! Shut up! -What report? -For the car accident. -What car? -My car! It's down there. We need to make a report for my insurance. Not to say "I told you so", but it was sabotage. -What? -So, how do we handle this report? Now's not the time! He was very clever. -Who was? -Julien, of course. What about him? -I have forms for the report. -Yes, perfect. -Yes, but they're in my car. -Go get them, then! And to think I hadn't fully paid it off yet! The steering's busted. -It's been sabotaged. Here, look. -Sorry? Look. I'm curious to see what he'll do in the final scene. -Last scene? -When the widow mourns his wife! -What do you mean? -You'll see. -Can I use your phone? -Sure. -Hello, Mr Duchemin? -That's me. This is Inspector Achouba. Terrible accident. Your Jeep in ravine. Two deaths! That's impossible! Come identify the car and bodies at the tunnel. Alright. That's awful. I'm on my way. You're right. The steering's been sabotaged. That's impossible, it can't be true! Is someone trying to harm you? Sir? I don't understand. What happened? What's going on? You'll find this man's fingerprints on the car's tie rod. -Sorry? -You're coming with me. To check your prints. Ridiculous! Why would I sabotage my-- Who said it was sabotage? Sure, let's go. -Julien, it wasn't you, was it? -Of course not. -Let's go. -Come on. Julien! Pay. Come on, honey, cut it out! This sure isn't cheap! That's 10,000 per person per week! There's a problem… I think there's a problem with… Can I use your phone? Absolutely not! -I warned you, but you never listen! -Mom, listen to me! -Absolutely not! -But I-- Mom! Mom, listen, I-- That's not what I'm asking you, mom! "Mom, give me money or I'll be stuck in jail!" -Mom, my dear mommy-- -Go to jail, then. I won't lift a finger! "Julien Duchemin, found at the Canary Islands." "A complaint from a restaurant owner against a man who assaulted him "because the steak he ordered was overcooked, led to the interrogation of Julien Duchemin." "He was living in Las Palmas under a false identity." Domec, the director wants you. Me? Paul! It's nice of you to get me out. -Did they torture you? -No, why? Well, I was worried. You've lost some weight. -You think so? -Yes. I did feel a little responsible for what happened. A little. Did time go by really slowly in your dark cell? No, it helped me think things through. Sorry, I'm still in love with you. Oh, Paul. I don't want to hurt you. Too late. I need to… go away and forget all of this. I'll travel around the world. Alone. Not a problem. Paul, what are you doing now? You said "around the world." The planet's round, you'll eventually end up back here. So, I'll wait. See ya. Barbara!
