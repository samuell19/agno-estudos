Show yourself. Fraulein Ozu. I've been awaiting your arrival. Who are you? Who I am is of no matter. But... if it is the only way to put you at ease. I am Kommandant Heinrich Moebius. You are not the man I've been dealing with. I need to speak with him. I regret to inform you that my predecessor is uh... shall we say on permanent relief. From this point on, all dealings will be with me. And our first order of business... is for you to put that... crude weapon into its proper place or it will end up through your soft belly. I knew that any accord with your mongrel race... would end in trickery and fear. Bastions of a primitive error. You turn your back on a gift? How short sided of you? I have no interest in your trinkets from the past. I will offer this to my own country then. Speak now, women. I will be free to leave. And my benefactors will share in the spoils. Careful Fraulein I take contracts very seriously. It is yours if you agree As you like. Before I turn you free, let us see what... could have been so important. Ahh. That is good Fraulein. I like it. We have a deal? I am... a man of my word. I have... set you free. Do with her corpse as you wish. Then dispose of it. I can't believe we just walked right out of there. We barely crawled out with our lives. Uh Uh uh Poor Ninja. I'm sorry, guys. He didn't make it. I couldn't grab him before we got out of there. I would never let that happen to you guys. And believe me, we'll get Tunneler back. And Pinhead, we'll get you some new clothes. I hate to break it to you, all of you. but there's no way that we can get Tunneler back now. We can't take on the Nazi's and the Japanese all by ourselves. We did it last night. And look at us now. We need to tell someone and let them deal with it. What're we going to tell them? That Los Angeles is crawling with Nazi's and Jap's. And we had to storm their hideout to get back our magic puppets? We don't have to tell them the whole thing. That's why we're not going to tell them anything. Those greasy kraut's killed my brother. I owe him my life. And... If I get killed in duty, then so be it. Danny, I know how you feel about your brother. He was a great guy. And I know that you somehow feel responsible for his death, but you're not. You should be proud of what you've done so far. You saved me and stopped the weapons factory from being blown up. Be satisfied with that. There was only a couple of those creeps last night... and that dragon queen. She was Japanese. turn queen to Chinese. The point is... I don't want you're getting yourself killed, too. We need help. Blade. We can go get Tunneler now. What do you mean? What's the problem? Oh. I knew it. That dragon... Japanese person still has him, doesn't she? Tunneler escaped Ozu? Ozu's dead? Well. Thank Heaven for small favors. Oh, so where is Tunneler now, Blade? Oh, brother. The Nazi's have Tunneler. We have to get him back. We will. We got to think about this. We need a plan. I wonder what those grimy kraut's have up their sleeves. Not a peep out of you guys. Anything happens, hide. Act natural. He could just be selling Bibles? For once, I hope so. Can I help you fellas? I think so. Ahh. Hello, my friend. My family. I know, you can not speak aloud. But you speak volume within me. Speaking with your toys, again, Doctor? No, I was just talking to myself. Do you think you should be in here... wasting time on such frivolities? Should you not be in the laboratory... working on the task that Commandant Moebius gave to you? Yes, of course. Then why are you not there. These frivolities as you call them. They help me to clear my mind. They inspire me to think. Uh. And what else inspires you to think, Doctor? Swine, you fancy me, don’t you? No, no, no. No, of course not. How could an old man like me make lov- Are you saying that I am not desirable? Nein, I'm not saying that. You Uschi are the most desirable creature I've ever laid my eyes on. You old fool. Do you really think you have a chance with someone like me? You. Ha, ha, ha... I must admit, you have a skilled hand, Doctor. Danke Fraulein. Uh. Is this suppose to be me? Do you like it? Uh. Your talents are wasted on such things. Herr Mobius chose you for your mind. Not your carving abilities. But the question remains. If this work is complete, if ever, would I be truly allowed to see my family? Ah. So this is what's really on your mind. You do not trust Herr Moebius, or me? But... But this project here is an impossibility. Your task is to turn his dream into reality. When you do, you will see your family. Until then, we, are all that is keeping you alive. Uh. Cheer up, Doctor. When you have decoded the symbols, I promise you a bonus that I am sure will be to your liking. But what if the Commandant were to find out. Shh... This will be our secret... from Herr Moebius. Danke schön. I've been wanting you from the first time I met you. Uh. Oh. Oh. I trust Uschi talk was... motivational Doctor Freuhoffer. The good doctor just needed some words to inspire him. Words? Words most often are not enough. I have found that to get the optimum desired result, nothing is more inspirational... as pain. Don't you agree at all? It comes the time when... spoken word falls upon deaf ears but... simple twists of a blade on a... kneecap, or eye socket, roars like a lion. And will never be forgotten. Yea? Good. Good. You see, Uschi, there are many methods of motivations. I must simply identify the subject and choose appropriate tactics. As always, your words are enlightening, Herr Moebius. Teach me more. Später, später mäusezähnchen there is business to attend to. Doctor, I assume since you have found the time to waste the morning in here... that you have made bold advancements to my machine. - On the contrary, Commandant. Very lit- - Nonsense. I demand a presentation. - But, Commandant, we can not... - Schnell. What's the heck? You must be Danny Coogan, and you must be Beth. - Yeah? - Sure? Who, who in blazes are you? Major Collins, US army. - Oh. - Oh. We thought we'd been had by the Nazi’s for sure. Yea. Excuse the informalities. I don't do well in an office. Now the only action this old dog gets is... shooting a pencil across the desk. Now if someone were to tell me that the Nazi's had invaded the U.S. And were walking among our fine citizens, I'd have to wrap them up in a butterfly net. But we all know differently, don't we? - I know about the arms facility. - I can explain everything. Son, hero's don't have to explain anything. I want to personally congratulate you... for a job well done. If not with you two, the Krauts would have done some serious damage. Americans need citizens like you... to do their part for the war. Hell, if I were younger, I would've joined you two. Screw being a citizen, I want to enlist. It's all I've ever wanted. Danny, wearing this uniform isn't what we're about. It's the soldier's spirit that makes all the difference. It's easy for you to say. We've been watching the Nazi’s for some time now. They were spotted on Bodega Bay. And a German U-boat was detected off the coast of Santa Monica pier. We believe they have taken root in our very own China Town. We know about the attack on the arms facility. But our intel came too late. And we wouldn't be able to stop them. But the question remains. How did you two stumble across this plot? Danny, maybe we should tell him the whole story. Son, it's a matter of national security. Get on with it Doctor. Let us see what you have accomplished, or what you have not. I'm sorry Commandant, but we can not commence with testing at this moment. We don't have a test subject. That will not be a problem. You can't hold me here. My friends will come looking for me. I'm quite confident they will not. What are you going to do to me? My God. In order for the resurrection device to work. One must have a subject that needs to be resurrected, no? Yes, of course. Prepare this stock. On with the procedure doctor while I'm still feeling charitable. What's happening? I do not know. It has not been tested before. Fix it. Look. You have... the distinct honor... of being the prototype for my dream of a new world. A soldier of utmost strength. A soldier who will never die. A new race for a new world which I am the master of. I want to play with him. Perhaps I will train him, as a pet for you dear Uschi. Freuhoffer. I am very sorry Commandant but... but... the device still has some kinks to be worked out. I don't seem to crack the symbols. Need I remind you that you're only alive because it is my wish. How could I forget Herr Commandant? You will make the device operable. I will, Herr Commandant. In the interim, I want you to study this specimen. - A kitten? - An oddity. Since you are so keen to play with toys, I trust you would have seen such a thing before. Careful doctor. This is no child's play thing. Fascinating. Astounding craftsmanship. I have never seen anything like this before. I trust you will unlock the secrets held within, ja? It will be my honor Herr Commandant. Tinker wisely doctor. If it is of no use to me or my vision, destroy it. Or it will be you who is destroyed. That is some story son. Last night Danny saved half the city from being blown to smithereens. And if Danny says that there is more of them out there... then you can bet your bottom dollar on it. 'Cause, if you don't help us, he's going to go in there alone and get himself killed. We know the Nazi's are out there. We've got a bead on 'em. We just haven't pinpointed their location yet. Have of either you ever heard of a... Dr. Emil Freuhoffer? Uh... No. Dr. Freuhoffer is one of the most brilliant minds in the world. He's cured countless diseases, saved million of lives. I even hear he's, working on a way to get a... man on the moon. But his mind in the wrong hands is a very bad thing. The doctor disappeared a year ago from his native Austria. Not a trace. What does that have to do with us? Ozu was spotted in China Town this morning. I shudder to think if Freuhoffer working for her. - See? It all adds up. - Uh huh. What are you going to do about it, Major? Well, you just let us worry about that, son. I don't want you to wind up getting yourself killed. Stone. This is Sergeant Stone. He's going to be watching after you. We want to make sure you don't get into any trouble. Great, a baby sister. Come on Major, you gotta be jerkin' my bopper, right? I mean, eleven combat tours... now this? It's only for a few days, sarge. Look, General Porter is flying in from Europe. He's gonna meet with some high ranking officials that's strictly classified. He's taking time out of his busy schedule. To honor those who have shown superior bravery, with a small VIP gathering. Lucky dogs. Boy, I'd sure like to meet him. This is all very hush, hush. Eyes are watching. No one, is to know that General Porter is here in town. Yes sir. OK. You can go. Get out of here. You heard the man kiddies. Out on the ten-hut. And wipe those turd eating smirks off your faces. Oh, by the way, just one little thing. You two... are going to be among the guests of honor. Out. Go... go. - Thank you sarge. - Yes sir. Heinrich, come to me. You work too hard. How can you ignore this? Impossible. What is it? That is so important. These symbols are the key, I know it. They are merely drawings made by primitive hands. Don't be foolish. They were created before man walked across this cursed earth. They predate magic, predate dreams, nightmares. There is a power in them, knowledge of all things, and the one to learn that knowledge, will be master of all. Moebius, you are a great man, a powerful man, I used to think your studies in the occult were just a passing interest. Now I see you're a man obsessed... with magic. You mock what I have devoted my life to? My reputation on? I have killed for far less. These visions, I’ve had my whole life, are not fantasy. They began as crippling dreams. And then I embraced them. Learning that they are transmissions of destiny. From another world. It is not by chance that I am here. I made it happen. Guided by the hands of the ancient ones. These symbols... these symbols are the key to my resurrection device. I know it. Because of me, the Reich will no longer loose men on the battlefield. How can one kill a soldier who's already been slain? Fallen soldiers, will rise to fight for the Fatherland, and then for Moebius. You better hope the Führer does not hear such scandalous talk. The Führer is a fool. He does not believe the device will work and demanded that I shut it down. But I will show him that I will bow before no man. I love it when you speak with such passion. Come to me. Scheisse. Come in. - What is it? - Kommandant. - Spit it out dummkopf - Apologies for the intrusion. A message. You have other distractions? Nein Kommandant. - Then remove yourself from my sight. - Heil Hitler. What does it say? The bulldog of the west will be crawling to this bastard city. General Porter. A powerful symbol of the American peoples tenacity and bravado. - And a thorn in the Reich’s side. - There is no more time to waste. We must have the device operable upon his arrival. I will see to it. What better field test. Making him taste my heel. - There is a place for that. - Yeah, I'm sure there is. Swell place, you two live together. - That is none of your business. - I live here, alone, now. Huh. Thought you two were an item. Guess you ain't, huh. - Don't even think about it, buster. - I ain’t so bad for an old dog face toots. - Danny is twice the man you are. - Yeah, I'm sure he is. Look, you don't want me here. And I don't want to be here, understand? Machine guns and sticky bombs are my thing. Waking up in a fox hole to a mortar shell alarm clock. - I ain't no freakin' baby sitter. - We aren't kids. You don't have to stay here, go do as you please. We won't rat you out. Uh-uh. The Major says I got to keep an eye on you two. And I'm a man of my word. Whatever you two got going on between each other, ain't none of my business. Lets just try and be civilized toward one another, huh? Do you even know how. You know, now that you mention it. I am a lot more domesticated on a full stomach. So what say you hustle those pretty little gams of yours off to the kitchen, and rustle us up some grub. You have got to be kidding me. You know that isn't such a bad idea. I can't remember the last time I ate. - We're waiting. - Oh, men. hmm. - You sure do cook up a good mess toots? - Excuse me? I think he means you're a good cook. They call it mess in the Army. - I gotta admit something to you Danny. - That your more animal than man. I've been called worse. - What is it sergeant? - Call me Sarge, everybody does. - Anyhow, I know who you are. - What do you mean? I knew your brother. You knew Donny? How? He was always hanging around at the recruiting station. Good kid. Would've made a great soldier. Wanted nothing more than to give them dirty krauts the old what for. Yea, that was him? I'm sorry about what happened. I truly am. Poor guy didn't even get to put on a uniform. Well let me tell you something? That didn't make him no less of a soldier in my eyes. No sir, he was one of us. - Yeah. - And he died a hero. - He used to talk about you. - He did? Sure, he was always yappin' about ya. Hell, he was always yappin' period. That was Donny. Dammit, it ain't right what they done to him. And you and me, we're going to settle the score kid. Oh no you don't. You're supposed to make sure that Danny doesn't get himself into trouble... or killed or worse. - You're supposed to follow orders. - My orders are to keep an eye on you two. And I can do that while I'm out plugin' Nazi's... with one hand behind my back. Danny, you can't do this. You said that we can't do this alone, that we needed help. Well help has arrived. This isn't what I meant. I'm all you got right now sister, and times a wastin'. The brass has to cut through miles of red tape just to blow their noses. He's right. We have to do this, and we have to do it now. Now hold on son. We can't just go in there balls out, guns a blazin'. We gotta come up with a plan first. And then we go in there balls out and guns a blazin'. - I guess you're right. - Yeah. What do you have in mind? Well, first you got to tell me everything you know. Don't keep nothing back. Well, before we get started, I think there's something you need to see. I um... am not really sure if that's the best idea. Knock off the games. I know you two are hiding something. There ain't no way you two Pop-Tarts... took down that munitions plant by your lonesomes. - Well, not exactly. - Yeah, you and who else? You gotta be shittin' me. This is the army I told you about. That's Blade. Leech Woman. Jester. Over there's Pinhead. I found them inside Toulon's trunk. Or rather, they found me. - I gotta sit down. - Your already sitting. OK kid. What gives, what's the gag. This isn't a joke Sarge. These are my friends. André Toulon, the guy who created them, he was killed for his secrets. And they’re the ones who stopped that arms building from blowing up. - You don't say... - They're the real heroes. And one of them was left behind, Tunneler. We got to go back and get him. Maybe grind up some German sausages while we're at it? Look here kid. This ain't no pantywaist walk in the park. No pansy ass mission picking daisies. This calls for trained professionals like myself. I'm thinking, maybe you kids caught them Krauts off guard, or... or maybe you got lucky just once. It wasn't luck. We kicked their Nazi cans. Look, as a trained professional... I've learned to trust my life to the men around me. But my trust only goes so far. And the cut off point, is kids and toys. Sorry to inform you Sarge. But we're all you got. Oh, for crying out loud. This will not hurt you at all, my friend. Huh, fascinating. Not what I expected at all. Lets see what secrets you hold. No cogs, no gears, no pulleys. Huh, you are too remarkable. Let see what we have here. Ah. This is the key that will open the door to secrets we seek. You are too excited, Herr Freuhoffer. Did you forget the bareness that I promised you? Uschi, I must pursue this breakthrough, if I am ever to see my daughter here. - Don't be a fool old man. - But. But. Uschi, what is the meaning of this? - Please, no. - I see how you look at her. - It was not my idea. - I know. Oh my God. Not yet am I a God. You only live because it is my wish. Finish your experiment and then I will decide your fate. Uschi... Oh my darling. I ain't so sure about this... at all. I don't like going into a mission without a battle plan. It's just a little recon is all. Yeah, that better be it. We ain't prepare for a fight, and I don't want any of us getting hurt, especially me. Ever chivalrous. And while I run the subject sweet pea. I'm thinking maybe you outta stick around here. Not a chance. Suit yourself, but don't be holding us up. She'll be fine. Any trouble comes our way, she can out run anybody. Really, she out run a bullet from a machine gun ever? - It won't come to that. - Well, lets hope. All right, we gonna do this thing or not? Yea, just a second. Beth, can you help me out a sec? - Oh boy you are heavy. - Here you go Pinhead. There you go. Blade. Sorry, Leech Woman. Sarge may be right. Some of us should stay behind, Just in case we're caught. Sometimes, the tide that turns the war, is fought on the home front. - Right, Sarge? - Sure. Sure it is. Every ones got to do their part. And no one role is more important than any other. I can't believe I'm actually saying this crud. All right, lets move out. Careful Emil, not to spill a drop. You will be back soon, my darling. Come, come to Freuhoffer, you can do it. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Come, you can do it. Oh. How could I be so stupid? Scheiß. The serum was not strong enough to resurrect a human being. It must be synthesized. This time, I will not fail. No. Freuhoffer! Explain. I have opened the secrets of your resurrection device. Go on. - And be careful while you say. - The symbols, useless. But the basis of my equation was sound. The secret lies within that strange puppet you found. Doctor, perhaps your mind is splintered from working under such immense pressure. The secrets of the universe are not found in a bastard toy. And you are correct Commandant. It is not the puppet. It is what's inside. What makes the puppet's alive. Stop playing these games now or I will end it. You see, the serum inside creates life. However, it's not strong enough to give life to a grown up adult. Are you suggesting an army of youth? You are even more sadistic than I imagined. No, let me rephrase. The serum's key magical component works only on small objects like these puppets. I have to synthesize it in order for it to give life to a human being. And that can take some time I'm afraid. What good does that do me. Porter's arrival will be soon and the opportunity will be lost. Oh, but it won't. In the meantime, I have designed something very special for you. Out with it. - What is this? - Shh. Kommandant Moebius, please meet Bombshell. I will bury you so far that only the devil himself will find you. But wait, there is more. Bombshell, please show the Kommandant what you can do. Thank you Bombshell. That will be all for now. - Impressed? - Don't fool yourself doctor. I will allow you a field test. But do not fail me. You are on unsteady ground. My fate, is in your little hands now, Don't fail me. But be careful, my darling. It has to be here somewhere. I don't know kid. We've been out here all night and not so much as a whiff of sauerkraut. You sure this is the right place? Did you hear that? You two stay put. - Halt. - Not on your life. - Danny, are you OK? - He's all right. He's fine. You can really take a punch there kid. I'm impressed with all of you. Pinhead! What the hell just happened? You'll be okay Pinhead. We'll fix you up in no time flat. Lets get out of here and regroup. I can't mend this. We'll have to use something else. This will work. I don't suppose you happen to know what that was. My only guess is they took the serum out of Tunneler and gave it to one of their own puppets. Filthy Krauts Not now, we need to concentrate. All right, what is it? That's great and all but... We don't have time for that. Look, those Krauts were there for a reason. They got to be keeping Tunneler in there somewhere. When we find him, we'll find ourselves some Nazi's. You will do well, my friend. And your name will be Weremacht. And, just a few additions to you, and you will be ready. Blitzkrieg. Bombshell. You have returned? What is wrong? Why are you so weak? Huh, odd. The serum should last longer. Perhaps the synthesis weakened the serum. We'll keep this our little secret. Moebius must not know. I trust we had a successful mission, Not bad for our first outing, Moebius will be pleased with us. And don't worry. We have other new friends who will help you. Here, let me help you with that. Thanks Beth. I don't know what I’d do without you. Well, that's why I'm never letting you leave my sight. You look so handsome. You two make me wanna puke. Oh, you can't go looking like that. I don't know any other way to look. Donny has to have something that will fit you. It is going to take a lot of spit to shine you up. What? - Here, that should fit you. - Oh, Christ. It won't kill you to spiffy up a little bit. You got to do it on the way over though. We're gonna be late. Sorry sweetie, we gotta shake a leg. Come on Sargent. I am impressed Doctor. Your toys have performed better than expected. But do not forget, the priority is the resurrection device. I have not forgotten Herr Kommandant. Now that the location has been revealed. I want General Porter's head on my breakfast platter tomorrow morning. - Yeah? - Jawohl. And I am afraid to inform you Herr Kommandant, that General Porter's head might be in a million little pieces. Kamikaze, be careful. Use your power with caution. You will only get one chance. Thank you, my master. General Porter, I am proud to introduce to you an outstanding young man, and a perfect example of American youth. Danny Coogan General. You are a hero of mine and it is a pleasure to meet you. Damn fine to meet you too Danny. And the pleasures all mine. And you might say that you're the hero in the room tonight. Oh, I don't know if I'd still be standing here if it wasn't for my gal Beth. - Mam. - And Sergeant Stone here, well, he's a pro at kickin' Nazi can. Defending our country. At ease everybody, I don't like parties to get so stuffy. So lets get down to brass tacks. Danny and Beth, I have something for you. In appreciation of your outstanding services rendered... in the protection of the United States of America, and for showing of the utmost courage in the face of adversity. I want to award you both. These tokens of appreciation of your country. The medal of bravery. General Porter thank you so much. Well, thank you for being such a fine American. Son? I'm sorry Sir. I can't accept that. This is an honor that is rarely if ever bestowed on a civilian. That's the point, Sir. It should be given to any man who signs up and does his duty. They're all heroes. I'm just a kid. All I ever wanted was to enlist, and stick it to the Krauts. But because of this bum leg I can't even do that. - I don't want a medal. I want a uniform. - No, you deserve this. I deserve a fighting chance to serve my country. Let me see what I can do. Lets get a photograph of me shaking hands with these fine young Americans. - You okay General? - Thanks to you and your little friends. Call me directly. You just earned your ticket into the United States Army. I don't know what we're going to do. We're no match for them. Well one thing we're not gonna do is sit around here and mope son. We're no match for them. Kid, the key to win in any battle is the element of surprise. Surprise? They have a tank. What is it Leech Woman? What is this? - Did you do this? - Whatcha got there toots? Our element of surprise. Your toys have proven well in the battlefield doctor. - As I knew they would.. - But... They are no match for a living breathing soldier under my control. I will ask you again. What is the status... of my resurrection device. I'm in the process of synthesizing a new serum... A single component was missing that I could not at first comprehend. - But you have now? - Oh yeah, of course. It was magic Commandant, and very difficult to replicate. My studies in... the occult have led me to understand that all things in this universe... can be reduced to some form of alchemy no matter how obtuse. even magic. And you were correct, as always. - I want to witness a test, soon. - You will, Kommandant. I just hope we find where those creeps are hold up. Pipe down. Where's that cowboy. - His name is six shooter. - He went down this ally. Stay here. - Ah. - Scheisse! That's some back up you got there kid. What? Hey kid, is this him? Tunneler. Don't worry guys I'll fix him up. We ain't got time for that now we gotta take him with us. You, you there. Well there goes our element of surprise. Nice going kid. You zeroed your first Nazi. You have saved me the trouble of finding you. Though I must admit you have been quite the annoyance. Glad to done our part. I would advise you to lower your weapon. Over my dead body Hans. That is the plan. Doctor, would you be so kind as to ready you friends? They are already here Kommandant. Kommandant, I may come out over in there. - Don't even think about it buster. - Please no, you don't understand. Start yappin. You weak American dog. Get up. Don't be so sour. Who's the dog now? You're gonna make it Sarge. I'm gonna get you out of here. Make me a promise son. I'll make those Nazi's pay. Give 'em hell, soldier. And you are next boy. Come and get me Kraut. Never send a boy to do the work of a man. - You forgot one thing. - What are your last words boy? Never screw with America. Freuhoffer, get me into the device, Schnell. I am afraid you remain a man, a dead man, a dead man at last. What have you done? I did not synthesize the serum for humans. That was the only way to break free from you. Murdered by your friend. Now Kamikaze. This is going to be bad. Everybody out, now. Nein. Thank you both for saving my life. Tell it to the Army pal. Please let me go. Danny, let him go. Stand down soldiers. I guess you've earned your freedom. We couldn't have taken him down without you. Danke schön. How could I ever repay you? Good luck. You did good back there. We all did. Heh heh heh heh heh.
