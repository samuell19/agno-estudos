Tell me a little about yourself. I do not know what to say. I am 43 and divorced. I have a son, but it bother you not hear about. Yes I would like to. Sorry, but this is the first time I do something here. It is okay. There is no hurry. You have a nice voice. It's sexy. - Do you think so? - If I do. You're easy to talk to. - You're probably good at your job. - The damage might not. - Now you tell us a little. - What do you want to know? I do not know... What are you wearing? - Kevlar. - Wow, how sexy! The shooter is in position. Keep him on the line. - Haas, let me persuade him. - We shoot as soon as we can. Are you insane? If you shoot, so people die there. Five minutes. Team one, give me a report. - Are you there? I thought you hung up. - Yes, I'm still here. I thought that maybe we can meet face to face. On a date? Yes. It is a lie... This should not happen. I would not do any harm. I just wanted my damn tax refund! Dan, I beg you. Hold on a little longer. I do not care what happens to me. My son deserves something better than this. Team one, be ready to shoot. Agent Blair! Hell! Dan, tell me where we're going on a date. What? I know an Italian place. It is a small place called Fellini's, I think. - Do they have good food? - Yeah, it's fantastic. It's where I proposed to my bitch an ex-wife. So maybe we should go somewhere else. I know not how you look. How do I recognize you? Believe me, it will be difficult... ... to overlook me. Whose side are you on, Blair? Would you take a bullet for one of your disturbed admirers? If you want to follow your sick female instinct, so here you go. So do us both a favor. But no one should die because you can not follow orders! Agent Blair, I swear by my life that you're done. You must be out of my unit, my city and my time zone. They find you never during all the paperwork, I bury you under. Your telefonsexdage is over. Are you following? Good evening. Welcome on board. - Welcome on board. Lovely bag. - Thank you. Good evening, sir. Welcome aboard. Pardon. Excuse me. Is this your place? - Unfortunately not. - Typically. Surely a crying child. I hope not. After all, I'm already tired of snobs in the first class. My name is Claire. We have not worked together before. - Is this your first trip per night for D.C.? - No. You stay here while Rick reviewing safety procedures - - and then immediately begin to serve food and drink. Well then. Thanks. Excuse me, but it has been my place. I actually have the window seat. - I already strapped me down. - Okay... - Not to be difficult, but... - It is okay. You're sitting in my seat. It does not matter. Sit However, just somewhere else. Listen, asshole. I do not want to. There is actually 44A on my ticket. Move or I skinning the cat sweatshirt you and stop it up... - Is everything all right here? - She threatened me. I am terribly sorry. Pardon. Sorry, but it's been a long day, and I will not be a nuisance. I would just sit in my seat, which he has taken - - and close your eyes and sleep for five hours. Can we offer something to drink or a little snack? - I want a free meal. - It comes immediately. Will you come with me? - And an extension to the safety belt. - Of course. Sorry again. I am terribly sorry. I usually deal with people better. It did not mean to shout. You sit probably better here. - Do you mean it? - We can not bear trouble in tourist class. - I thought you were going to throw me off. - Oh no. I take it there. - Thank you. - No reason. By the way, I've always dreamed of doing what you just did. - Thank you very much. - You are welcome. This is your captain. It takes a few minutes before we roll out from the gate. So do you it convenient, we are soon in the air. The weather is clear and the flight time is calculated to five and a half hours. Welcome on board. - Is this your first time? - Pardon? At the first class. - Do I look so forlorn? - No, on the contrary. If you get this one here? You seem to belong here. Terry. Terry Lennox. Blair. Gretchen Blair. - Can I buy you a drink? - Yes please. - Excuse me, may I ask... - No, sit. A washcloth? Sir.? - What are you fleeing from? - Nothing. No? Okay. Not to be rude, but I'm not so good at small talk right now. - It is okay. I drop it like. - It was not how I meant it. I fucked up - - and have to sit behind a desk in D.C. rest of life. So I have no hurry. - Do not leave. - Good thinking. Forget D.C. and take with me to Paris instead. You were not kidding with dropping the huddle. Why not? Because it's crazy. It's no worse than doing something that makes you unhappy. The first class has to afford it, but I have to stick to the rules. People follow the rules, because they are afraid to make decisions. I work for the police, and they go very much up in the rules. - Can I help you? - I was wondering where you have your gun. Hello and welcome aboard at Speedbird Airlines! May I have your attention? Let me hear you cheer! - Let me hear you, first class. - Shut up! Gab not! - Do you like it? - What's happening to you? The airline, which is your home in the air.

In talking together and create a relationship. You may get some sort of sympathy for them. The poor sitting locked up in a bank with the whole world against them. While they threaten innocent with a gun. - That you have the right. - Thank you. But sometimes, deep inside... ... you hope that they will make it. Everyone keeps with the underdog. Anything with potatoes... So easy was not to be. Nothing. Maybe we should take... - Excuse me a moment. - Brussels sprouts sounds good. Sir... They should go back to your place. I can not decide. They jordbærcheesecake. Should I take it or karamelbuddingen? - Are you okay? - I'm fine thanks. Speedbird 709 increases 1000-6000. We need to land as she sits astride me and takes his coat. - You are joking. - Cockburn sitting next to. He said: "Shall I take over?" So I ask: "With the girl or the plane?" Speedbird 709, we can see you on the radar. Idiots... Do you have a have a drink more? Terry? Want more? I did not think you were afraid to fly. Not to fly, but more to lose control. - Should I call the flyværtinden? - No I... It will be fine, thank you. Do not worry. The aircraft is the most modern. Error Security system and remote control. - As a flying tank. - How do you know that? FBI uses it when we practice rescue operations. We practice everything. Stealth attack and containment. - Are you well paid? - Not good enough to fly like this. Around 70,000? The boundary between being eccentric and rude is subtler. Would you like to be 50 million richer when we leave the plane here? I have plugs in your ears. Would you repeat that? I offer you 50 million just on the spot - - if you agree to help me. That's what I thought you said. What do you need my help? To make me live the plane. Remain open, please. What I am trying to say is that the plane here, soon to be hijacked. They are not interested in terrorism or politics. Only in me. - Who is it? - One of them is a stewardess. Flyværtinde. You do not say stewardess. She is not a real flyværtinde. She is... Who is she? My ex. - Would you like something to drink? - No, it's okay. Maybe a little water or coffee? No, it's okay, thanks. It's a long flight, and it takes a long time before I come back. Okay, so I take a ginger ale. Here you go. Thanks. We have not much time. I know that I put you in a difficult situation. Are you with that I can sign up to be a threat? I have not threatened anyone. They're after me. If you do not stop, I download attendants. Listen carefully. I know them and know how they act. We can not trust anyone here. Why do you even bother? - It's about what I have to. - I do not want to hear more. When I am back, I will pretend we never had this conversation. - Gretchen... - That's enough, I said. You'll have to trust me. Generate master you? No, he has just gotten a little too much to drink. Excuse me. Champagne. What are we celebrating? Hello? Are you okay? - Have you missed me? - If I have. What a beautiful hairstyle. - I told you it was great. - I ask nicely. - It was not very nice? - Where is it? The coffee machine? The I threw out with the rest of your junk. - That's how I remember it. - Where? Unfortunately, the aircraft not in the air long enough for you when you find it. Terry? The plane is ours now. - Nothing. - I'm not an idiot, Sharpe. Look here. Valentino. - Canali, Savile Row. - doubt you my taste? Your taste is the problem itself, Terry. You must always show you. How do you think we found you? Lesson no. 1: If you want to cheat someone, make sure that they do not survive. It is you the expert. Realize that you were greedy. One man can not possibly spend that much money. Congratulations, you got me. But what is the 10,000 meters in the air? I have run out of a row. This is not a getaway car. Should I get the plane to change course, the Air Force just shoot us down. I agree with you, but first they must find us. What should I do with it? - Hey sweety. - Are you old enough to fly himself? - What do you want? - Coffee. I'll take a soda. - You have not worked here before. - Then you would be able to remember it. I believe it. - Do you tell it? - She should have let it go. It is difficult when there is a billion at stake. I let you keep your legs Sharpe. You should have taken them on the neck. Now I have to listen to your advice and kill you. What do you imagine, Terry? But I must admit that you are a skilled thief. Unfortunately, you do not know how to hold on to things. The price is like for my children's schooling stay, but you can get a glass of water? Is there anybody? Frankly? Gold Member, I just... It does not end like this. - Save it for dullen first class. - You are still happy for me. I attack might this from the wrong angle. - I do not even know who she is. - That we have to find out. Pardon? Hello? Pardon? Oh God! You again. - You never told what your name was. - Gretchen Blair, FBI agent. - My name is Luke Byres. - You are Air Marshal. How do you know that? Be careful how you carry your weapon. You revealed yourself. Never mind. Listen carefully. I think that the plane has been hijacked. Luke? The plane has been hijacked. - Have they threatened you? - I do not know. There is a death flight out back. - Is this your first crisis? - It's only my third trip. I should have secured the cabin and cockpit. Wait, do not drink it there. There can be hijackers between staff. What nonsense! Stop complaining you. He said nothing about the girl uniforms. As if that makes any difference. You look like anyway Gene Simmons. 709 here. We are seeing some bad weather. - Requesting to go down to 8,500 m. - Perceived, Speedbird 709th Go down to 8,500 and stay there. We need to provide the master message and divert the aircraft. I will come along. I thought Sharpe could fly. He knows what he's doing. And what is it? He makes sure that passengers collaborations. Here is your captain. We experienced a drop in cabin pressure. There is nothing to worry about. Stay seated and keep oxygen masks on - - then comes the staff around and look for you. They do not belong staff. Will someone tell what the hell is going on? Remain in your seat. - What are you doing? - A security check. It's my bag! Sit down before I run my fist up your ass! Understood? - What's he looking for? - What do you think? A bomb! - Nothing happens, the captain said. - Do you think they would tell it? - They may have explosives on board. - No, they are not terrorists. - I'm sure the cockpit. - They've already taken it! Listen carefully. There is nothing on the plane as they want, and we must find it before them. The guy who sat next to me offered me a large sum to help themselves. We'll have to find him first. Can you fix the steward? - Yes, I can. What do you want to do? - I do not know. It was fucking... Stay calm and stay seated. It is a routine control. Air Marshal! - Terry? - I did not know you felt that way. We'll have to hurry. - Now I have you. - Is that your ex? - I assume it was a tough break. - You have no idea. Hullo! Sharpe? - What is going on? - Partially off the power. - Okay, I'm coming out. - Do not be silly. Stay there and lock the door. Say, how do I turn it back on. Where is he? - I'll talk to the captain. - Sit. - He must have slipped past. - We're on a plane, fool! - Sit down, everyone! - Sit. - He must be here somewhere. - Do you think so? So find him though! I had one job, fools. - Take the stitches now! - But the captain said we... Remove the mask now. Let's go. - Hello! Show me your face. - She can not breathe. Leave her alone! Can you see the light on? So it goes - - when I do not get to your seats. Agent Blair. You should have a kick in the ass. I knew I could trust you. Down! Was the agreement is not that you had to save me? We have no deal. If you need a little time alone, you should have just asked. What is the plan? My security is involved, so my arms are checked in. So we have to find my bag. Give me your hands. All passengers must be checked. Up with your hands. Show me your hands. - Where is the man who sat here? - I do not know. Where is he? Where is the man who sat here? Who knows or has seen anything? Where the hell is he? Have you broken arms? - Oh yeah. - Thank you. - What kind of bag is it? - A Fendi. - You lack certainly not money. - It is a bad copy. Matthew? - So what? - No sign of them yet. No trace? Hell, Sadie! We're on a plane. Is that how you talk to me now? No sorry. Well. Fly the plane, so I'll do it here. Check under the seats and in the toilet. Led anywhere on the plane. Find him! What the hell is this? Move! - Fuck! - Say it's a lie. - What happened to you? - I do not know. - They were right here. - Say it's a lie! - Do I have a mark here? - No, that's fine. - Damn! - Are you okay? - I'm just having a break. - Did you hurt yourself? Let me see. Here. How do you think it is to fly first class? Fantastic. Exactly as I had imagined it. Who are you? - Pardon? - Who the hell are you? How do you know these people from? How are you involved? - I was their partner. - So you worked together? With what? As freelancers, if you have to put it nicely. - So you're all criminals. - I prefer my description. This is not a joke. - I arrest you when we land. - But first we countries. Should I mention all the illegal acts you have committed on board? It is not me who is the villain here. Think that you believe in that stuff. But to be honest, you have not told me anything. - It was the perfect plan. - Yes, obviously. It was a damn good plan. I was the one who created the trust. The man in the suit. I could figure out where the money was less than five minutes. Sharpe... He looks like a bully, but his brain is razor sharp. All machines that have ever been built - - he can disassemble and reassemble with his bare hands. But he lays hands on people, the result is quite different. And as for my... ... ex... ... Sadie is the one who has balls. Balls? Nicely said. Go down there, Lennox. I want him alive. - And the woman? - Hugs her. Down! - Stop, it hurts! - Shut up or I'll kill you. Is there anyone at home? - You'll have to quit. - With what? To finish my sentences. People think that we're married. They saw us not shown. Thank God. I just spotted my suitcase. - Can you reach to it? - Yes. Just keep looking. Let me know if they come. I have it. Damn... - What? - Magazine. Wait a minute. Come on. Now I have you! I am not so easy to impress, but it was damn cool. Gretchen? - What are you doing? - Show it to me. - What? - What is worth to hijack a plane. - It is here. - What the hell is that? The last place anyone would look. WARNING! DANGEROUS GOODS! What is it taking so long? Stand still. Start walking. - What had you imagined? - You need to get me into the cockpit. The advantage with the biological material, - - is that you do not investigate it, because it can cause... - Tissue damage. - Exactly. Ask him open. - You can still pull you out. - Shut up and bit him open. - How much is he paying you? - I mean it. You have no idea how long I've prepared this coup. What I had to get through... ... and how much dirt I got on my hands. What's this about? - How much is it worth? - Something with ten digits. Joe's... So you snowed your companions? Is that how you do? You really do not have high thoughts about me. Those up there, my companions... It was those who stuck me in my back. Or closer to the stomach. What are you doing? Do you want to carry around a bucket shit? Open the door or I shoot! Matthew? You know what to do. - Are you okay? - Yes i am fine. But I can not get free. - Are you hurt? - No, I'm just sitting firmly. Terry? - He'll be back. - No, do not... You are safe here. Do not. Terry? Terry! Byres. The aircraft is secured. It is safe to go up there. I knew you were a good investment. I'm sorry, Terry. You are bad at choosing partners. - Where is your little companion? - Your goons came first. It does not matter. She dies anyway down there. 709, you are on 4500 m and wane yet. In the case of an emergency? - I redirect you now. - No. The hydraulic system is not working. - Is that...? - Keep your eyes on the road. It is here you will definitely like to see. It was almost as good as bad sex. It is okay. Thank you, my God. Thank God. This is your captain. I regret the hard landing. We had to stopover. I hope everyone is okay. Our mechanics checking the plane now. Let them do their work, we are soon on the wings again. We facilitate on six minutes. Neither more nor less. I'll fix it in five. Sit down and keep your mouth shut! Do not give me a reason to kill you! It would have worked, Sharpe. What did you say, Terry? We could be let go. This is unnecessary. "Even the best plan can go skewed. - I worked for it for seven years. It was the perfect plan. "And yet we are sitting here. - You no longer reach. There is no resort. Those we stole the bag from can never go to the police. It does not exist. But you stole a flight of 200 passengers on board. It can not be hidden. They will look for you everywhere. They are not going to lead at all. We all want to be dead. Full speed! I will not be on board while it facilitates. When they search the wreckage, they find all occupants. Even Sadie and me. The black box. The recordings. - They find out what has happened. - You know what... It is the beauty of it here. The aircraft will be my chief witness. The mechanics are in the process of installing a dummy - - that will tell something else. Officially got off the plane just problems with the hydraulics. In with it. - How long time? - Three minutes. Speed. We facilitate two minutes. Your share is located at the door. Let it open, but seal the cargo hold. Let's get out of here. - Close the door! - The hatch... I must give you, Sharpe... I thought I was the cleverest criminal. But you really... ... the wildest supervillain. Do not try to flatter me. - Are they finished? - We're ready to go, Captain. Come on! Let's just! You are really good people. Come on. I need your help. - Press start! - Corrects I did not stop, we can not facilitate. Come on. Flyværtinden help you. She helps you. Stand up in a row. You must help me to get people off the plane. Keep calm. Are you kidding me? Come on! Up on the series. Give me your hand. Come on! Give me your hand. Come on! You first. Spring! Come on! - It ends here, agent. - Luke? - Hands up. - What are you doing? Where are you going? Looking for Terry? Put the gun. How much he offered you? 10 million? Your asshole... Luxury Yacht magazine? Fuck you! 20 million? More? 20 or 30? - A little more. - The bastard! Luke, we have sworn to protect people. You know as well as I do that there is no money in it! - I do not care about money. - But I'm not. Come on, dammit! - How long time? - Three minutes. The control tower here. We have found the missing aircraft. In the 900 meters. Speedbird 709, came. Sadie! Sorry sweetie. You do not belong up here. You do not, bitch! Terry! - We'd better get going. - The second parachute is gone. - Do you have a good excuse? - Shut up. Now we slip away. Here, take it. - I have it. - Ready? - Yes. - Spring! Damn! You never answered. On what? Let me take it there. - Be careful where you put your hand. - Pardon... Never responded to what? Paris. Do you mean it? There is a little far to walk. We have enough time. It takes weeks before they discover that we were not on the plane. If they do it... So what do you say? Let's get down to the first. Translation: J. Petersen
