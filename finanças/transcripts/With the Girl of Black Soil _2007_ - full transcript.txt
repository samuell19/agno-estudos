Let's see... Where's the ball? That's right. - He's eleven? - Yes. Tong-gu's command of the language is that of a 3-year-old...as you know. Same's true of his intelligence. In his case, a special school is where he'll have to go. Read it, and why don't you pay a visit? You know, if he continues that way, he might show behavioral disorders. You've been cold, right?
