Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. - How much time do we have? - Your train leaves at four-thirty. That gives us five and a half hours. Isn't that the man that you...? Look, honey, why don't you do a bit of shopping, huh? Get yourself a... Or get mother and dad a present. How's that? All right. When do you want me to meet you? Right here, at three o'clock. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. He'll be wearing a black pin-stripe suit, a grey hat, and horn-rimmed glasses. He'll meet you here in about fifteen minutes. He'll buy a box of cracker Jack. All aboard! All aboard! - Hi! - Hmm? Oh! Well, did you find something you liked here? Hmm? - I nearly walked my feet off. - You did, eh? - We've got... - Mmm? - An hour and a half more. - Yes, yes. Say, how far is the hotel from the station? About five minutes. What have you got here, hmm? - We might as well go and unpack. - All right. - Yeah? - George, you dressed? Sure. What's the matter? You got a dame with you? - Yeah. - Well, bring her in! I thought you were ribbin' me. Very, very nice. Come in. This is George pappas of our New Orleans office. - George, this is frank Warren. - Frank. - How are you? - And, er... mrs Warren. - Hello, George. - The boss' wife. Better get my shirt on. You moving in with us, too? I always do. I earn my keep. Light housekeeping, wash his socks, sew on buttons. Aren't you boys pretty crowded in here? Oh, we get commercial rates that way. How'd you make out at the station? I didn't. You got a sports section around? Yeah, I've had experience with those stoolies. They get scared and run. That's the chance you have to take. Sure. A case like this won't be broken with one pigeon, anyway. But it can be cut awfully short. How long do you think this one will take? Oh, maybe a couple of months. - Frank? - Hmm? How long before my train leaves? Um... about an hour and fifteen minutes. See? Say, that's not very long for a sailor's wife, is it? Come on, George. Let's go downstairs and get some coffee. - Who wants coffee? - You do. Oh... let's go. Hello. It's for you. This phone been tapped yet? Not yet. They haven't got past fixing taxi drivers. On. Warren speaking. Well... Look, I waited for you until three o'clock. All right, I'll be there. Yes, I'll be there alone. No, I'll make it. - The guy at the station? - Kinda looks like we've started. Oh, er... Look, Stan, if I'm not back in time, will you put Judy on the train for me? Sure. And, er... check with horan, and get an office. I'll be there later. Er... Fl... If I miss you at the station, I'll call you, hmm? Yeah. A record crowd turned out to witness the opening day races at the Jefferson park track. Feature race of the afternoon is the governor's cup handicap, a mile and a furlong. Favourite to win is number four, marietta Jay. They're at the post, and they're off! There goes marietta Jay in the lead. But watch number two, black Oliver, a fifteen-to-one long shot. Coming around the far turn, it's marietta Jay first, high tension second, and black Oliver third. Watch that black Oliver pull up on the outside. They're coming down the stretch now, and it's black Oliver pulling ahead. And he wins by one length! The big fellow once more defeated the attempt of the district attorney to take him out of circulation. Charged with ordering the execution of five members of a rival mob, the big fellow was again exonerated. He announced that he would leave for Florida for some sunshine and racing. The big fellow's bodyguards have difficulty keeping away the crowd of admirers, who look upon him not as an alleged public enemy, but as a colourful and almost legendary figure. I was at the railroad station. The agreement was that I was to meet you alone. There was somebody there with you. I like men who keep their word. No, leave it open. Well, how about it? Do I get the ten per cent? What have you got? Collectors, almost all of them. Joints, every single one of them. How much money they got, who's got it. The guy in charge of the accounts for five years. What's his name? Joe doakes. George Washington. Do you want his birth certificate, too? He's got no name. What if he wants a cut, too? I'll take care of him out of... My end. For this, you got my personal guarantee. All right. Right now, I wanna see the lists. I wanna talk to your man. He's shy. I'm not. I'll get the lists. I'll talk. I'm a good conversationalist. Fine. That's fine. Need about twenty minutes to set it up. - All right, let's take a look, huh? - Oh, no. You meet me. “Where? - Corner of Ryder and fair. - Ryder and fair. All right. Be there in a cab, with the motor running. You'll have the list? With a take like this, they'll be bound in leather, with hand-painted illustrations, like a first edition. Collector's item. - Do you want some cracker Jack? - Uh-uh. Give me ten minutes' start. There must have been a hundred shots. Just as he come out of the theatre, their car pulled over to the kerb and they give it to him like this. Right in the bread-basket. I seen the whole thing. There's nothing here to see. Get back. Okay. Board! Stan, how long do you think this one will take? I told you. A couple of months. Or maybe a couple of years, like the last one? All right, Stan. Give him my love. - Bye! - So long, Judy. I guess she's used to it. Well, at least you'll be able to see her every once in a while. You're lucky. I wish my in-laws had a farm a couple hundred miles from here. - Did you meet zanger? - Yeah. Any luck? Nope. Are you gonna see him again? Yeah. - Wanna come along? - Sure. Used to work on the post. Covered criminal courts. Leg man. - Fired him a few months ago. - Why? Found out he was also working for somebody else. - The syndicate? - Yes, and they fired him, too. What did you find on him? A box of cracker Jack, overdue hotel bill, and an old scratch sheet. Coroner's office. What do you income tax boys want him for? He wanted to sell the treasury department evidence on the big fellow's income. How much would he have gotten? Oh, enough to retire on... Huh, Stan? About ten times over. - Yeah, for that kind of money, I'd... - You lay on a slab. Don't fly too high. Do you have any idea who killed him? More than an idea. I know. I'll have them picked up inside a half an hour. Inside of thirty-five minutes, they'll be turned out. In and out, like a turnstile. I just take tickets. Let me see your right profiles. That means the right side of your face. Let me see the left profile. Get your arms down. Take off your hats. Well, do you folks recognise them? Let it wait. How about it, newsie? I didn't see nothin'. Me back was turned, sellin' papers. Alice and me were in the back room. We... we stayed there all the time. How about the rest of you? Nobody saw anything. Nobody ever does. It happened right in front of most of you. What about it? You're in the cleaning and dyeing business. I know you pay protection. Everybody in that business does. - Now, where do you...? - Please. I don't know anything. I didn't see anything. I could get tough with you, if I wanted to. Sure. No matter how tough you get with me, it'll only hurt me. If I talk to you, it won't be me that gets hurt. It'll be my wife. Okay, go on home. Beat it, the lot of you. You men can step down. All right, shyster, let's have the papers. Don't you like your job, inspector? Sorry. Writs of habeus corpi. I'll give you two minutes to have my clients outside. In and out, like a turnstile. How are things in Washington, Warren? I didn't know you knew him. I don't. I never saw him before. Sergeant Shannon, our local agent mentioned you in his reports to Washington. I understand that you made... Made several raids on the syndicate last year. You must have some report? Mister, I'm just a desk sergeant. - You used to be a captain. - That was last year. Well, I thought you might be able to give us some information. I'm busy, mr Warren. I just want to do my job, and mind my own business. There's nothing for us to talk about. Warren! Yeah? Can I drop you and mr weinberg anyplace? Sure. The post office. Hop in! Glad to take you there. - Come on, Stan. - Thanks. Say, what do you figure a car like this costs, Stan? Oh, I'd say at least five, six thousand dollars. At least. - Nice car. - Yours? It belongs to a friend of mine. You know, that's quite a stunt, Stan. A man files an income tax for five thousand dollars a year, and a car like this costs five, six thousand dollars. A man has four cars. Four times five... You know, those are figures I'd like to see. Any time, Warren. You can even have a sharp pencil to add them up. Thanks for the ride. - Thanks for the cigar. - Don't mention it. Er... Warren, may I talk to you for a moment? It's, er... too bad you don't get a percentage of that three million dollars you're out to collect. Oh, I get my share. I can be reached at this address. I'll be there. All right, we'd better split it up. You take fair Avenue. I'll start down at the other end of Ryder and work back up. - Right. - Okay. Have you ever seen this man before? Mama! I'm looking for someone who might know this man. Never saw him before. The man in the picture, he was mr zanger, daddy's friend. Forget you ever saw him! Well, this cleans it up. Last year, just for the fun of it, we weighed all the records we'd collected in this case. Five hundred and seventy-two pounds. All junk. Not one piece of paper was signed by any of the syndicate bosses. Here... Say, can the taxpayers afford this office? I took it away from one of my men. - Well, give it back to him, will you? - Oh, no! Be glad to get rid of this case. Frankly, I can't figure out what you're gonna do with it. Can I see the zanger letter? Mmm. Didn't you know he was writing his obituary? I'm just the man who checks the books, remember? If you can do anything with that, you ought to be running the treasury. He's only paying taxes on a gross income of five thousand dollars, you see? That's what it says. And it's sworn and signed. Can you prove he made more? I can't. Five years' worth, I can't. It took almost a hundred years to build up this city. The syndicate captured it in less than a year. The big fellow gets the biggest split out of the syndicate's take, and his personal collectors pick up the money every day. And deposit the money in these... These dummy bank accounts. Dummy is right. Dummy, phoney, and fake. But they're pretty smart. All their business is done through front men and third parties. This is from one of his bookie joints. "January 2nd, five hundred dollars to John Smith. "January 2nd, twelve hundred and fifty dollars to Tom Jones. "January 2nd, four hundred and sixty dollars to Sam brown." Those names may be phoney, but the handwriting's real. It belongs to somebody. Somebody is who? “Whoever we find. Where did you find zanger last? It's a laugh, isn't it? A guy kills hundreds of people a year, and three bookkeepers go chasing for income tax. Very funny. If I had more room, I'd laugh. Well, facts are facts, and figures are figures, and sooner or later... Sooner or later, they add up. They'd add up a lot quicker if zanger were alive. Or the man who zanger was going to meet. All right, do you know what our next move is? - We give up, and go home. - Nope. We go out, and we get more books. Well, what looks good to you today, Pete? - Semester, in the fifth at hialeah. - All right. Gimme two bucks to win. What can I do for you, mister? You can hand over that book. Thanks. Twenty cents. Out of a quarter. How about taking your change in a number? Oh, I don't know. I never win. Now, mrs wasner, this may be your lucky day. I'll take a hundred and seven. I'll take this... And this. And I don't want my change in a number. No more field. - Maybe field all the points at hand. - All at one time. Crap dice. Twelve, two sixes. Shooting for ten. You've been here fifteen minutes, mister, and you haven't made a play yet. So what? You nervous? Play, or get out. - Let me see the manager. - You'll see the sidewalk, chum! You looking for trouble, mister? No, no, no. I'm looking for your books. Why, er... Of course. Sal, this gentleman is interested in our books. Please take care of him. Warren, how are you? They told me at your office that I'd find you here. Yes, they called. My wife... - How do you do? - Mr Warren, mr and mrs Gordon. - How do you do? - How do you do? Mr Gordon is my personal accountant. Oh, Edward, you're busy. We'll leave you and mr Warren alone. - Thank you, my dear. - Excuse me. - Sit down, won't you? - Thank you. - Beautiful home. - Mmm. - Yours, or your friend's? - Mine. I spend all the time I can away from the city. Oh, this is very nice. Very nice place. It's a shame you don't have a similar taste in clients. Frankly, mr Warren, I have very little liking for my clients. But, a man has to make a living. Oh, I'd say you make much more than a living here. My, this place must have cost at least... You have an accountant's mind. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - No, no, it's all right. When I was a young lawyer, I thought on those terms, too. Now, I can afford not to. It's a nice feeling to be able to afford nice things. You've been putting on quite a show. All that seizing of books. All that sweating it up in the federal building. Oh, it's been quite a lot of work, you know. And very impressive. To all parties concerned. Despite the fact that you could never find enough evidence to convict my client of spitting on the sidewalk. It's worth something. Purely nuisance value. How much? And how do you want it? I told you once. Three million dollars, plus penalty. Now you can pay in cash, cheque, makes no difference. All right, cut the kidding. - What's the pay-off? - I'm not kidding. No, I don't think you are. All right, what did you come out here for? I came here to borrow some books. Here's my library card. Sydney! A little advice. Free, no charge. An investigator is only as good as his stool pigeons. Live ones, that is. How many zangers can you kill? Sydney, I want you to go back to the city with mr Warren, and give him the books from the personal account. Thanks. Warren? Yeah? I promised you a sharp pencil to go with it. "Dear Judy. Things are going pretty well. "It's been a long, tough case, honey, I know, "but it looks like something will break any day now. "Yeah, any day." Six sixty-seven... - What? - Six sixty-seven. Seven-fifty... - Seven... - Eleven sixty-seven. - What sixty-seven? - Eleven sixty-seven. Eight eighty-eight. Wait a minute. On! Well, after six months of being punched day and night, this machine's finally got some sense. It broke down. We'll get a new one in the morning. Finish your calculations by hand. The machine quits, so do I. - Where you got to go at this hour? - To sleep. What are we trying to do here? Establish a world's record for working overtime? Well, you don't want to be on this case forever, do you? I have been on it forever. Roast in the summer, freeze in the winter. Look, I'm hot, I'm tired, I'm... My wife's two hundred miles away, and I haven't been up to see her yet. George, I'm fed up, too. I'd like to see my wife and kids. But frank is right. If he feels that it's... What does he know about feelings? He's got ice water in his veins. He's an adding machine. Punch him, and a number comes out. What are you trying to do, prove you're a genius? I'll sign an affidavit if it'll make you happy. Want a little action, don't you, huh? “A lot! Got any ideas? You're the boss. You're the man with ideas. Oh, cut it out, will you? We're all in this thing together. Even in those dummy bank accounts somebody had to sign the deposit slips, right? Okay. We go around, and collect the signatures of everybody that works on the syndicate. Five thousand people work for the syndicate. What are you gonna do, ask 'em to sign a petition? Hey, wait a minute. No, wait a minute! Maybe we don't need five thousand. Maybe fifty'll do, if they're the right ones. Hey, George, you want action? Okay, boy, you're gonna have it. I'd like to speak to mr horan, please. Look, I don't care if he is asleep. Wake him up, will you? I hope you guys know what you're doing. Did you get the warrants? Did you ever look for a federal judge on a hot Saturday night when the court's not in session? - Let's do it without warrants. - Relax, I finally reached judge Parker. How many deputy marshals did you get? Eighteen. They'll meet us at the garage in half an hour. What are you really after? Handwriting samples. I don't catch. Well, some people collect stamps. We collect signatures. What do you need me for? - To make arrests. - On what grounds? We're picking up the inside men in the syndicate, the bookkeepers and the managers. Is that enough? I'm way ahead of you. - Do you know what you're doing? - Sure, I know exactly what I'm doing. - I wanna see my lawyer. - Sign your name and address. I don't sign nothin'! Then you don't get to see your lawyer. Take your choice. Okay, go on back and sit down. Next! - Sign your name and address. - When can I see my lawyer? In the morning. Here. Sorry, inspector. This signature doesn't match up with any of these bank deposit slips. How long do you think it'll take you to go through this bunch here? Johnny, give us a rough estimate. I've got to analyse these, er... Deposit slips, and the signatures on these cards. It'll take at least a couple of weeks. Couple of weeks? Do you think you can hold these people in jail long enough for us to figure out which one of these we want? The best I can do is a couple of days, if we're lucky. Drop everything else. Who let him in? I gave orders... You couldn't get to a telephone fast enough, could you? I didn't think any of these monkeys could write. Pretty cute, Warren, but it won't work. Getting signatures is one thing, getting somebody to testify is another. Kinda stuck your neck out last night, didn't you? Go ahead, serve your writ. It's been served. There are still laws in this country. You ought to know it's illegal to invade the privacy of a man's home without a warrant. We had warrants. Yes, federal warrants, to seize books only. But herzog didn't have any warrants to arrest my clients on phoney vagrancy charges. The commissioner was very angry. I just left him. I wouldn't be at all surprised if you were out of a job. Here, you pin this on one of your boys. We might as well be honest about it. You, er... you aren't serious about quitting, are you? What do you think? - What'll it prove? - That I've still got a backbone. I'll call Washington. They'll talk to the commissioner. Skip it. I knew what I was doing when I went along on those raids last night. I know what I'm doing now. - You're throwing away... - What? A pension? We're all alike, aren't we? Every one of us. Civil service. "Hang on, sit tight, be a good boy, "when you're old and grey you can sit in the sun like a lizard." How many more years have you got to go, Warren? Shannon over there's only got two. Lucky fellow. Just two more years. He used to be my captain. Tell him about it. You can talk back now. I'm not your boss anymore. Go on, Shannon. Tell him. O'Rourke isn't listening. Tell him how you got to be a nice, obliging police sergeant, sitting behind a desk. Also tell him how you sleep nights. Here, I'm returning it. Police department property, cleaned, and oiled, and loaded. Warren, mind if I walk out with you a minute? You married? Yes. Got any kids? No. I've got three. A boy, nineteen, two girls, seventeen and fifteen. The boy goes to college. Herzog's a bachelor. He doesn't understand family men, like you and me. - Got a house? - Mm-hmm. Yes, in Washington. Haven't used it very much, but I will, one of these days. - Paid for? - Mmm... no. In a few years, though. Mine's all paid for. Insurance, too. Taken good care of the family. Two more years, and I'd have taken the missus down to Florida, and I'd have sat in the sun like... What was it herzog said? Oh yes, like a lizard. Ever think what you're going to do when you retire? No, I'm too busy. I... Want to walk down here with me a minute? Sure. I used to be a good cop, like herzog. Thirty years, I've been on the force. Went all the way up from pounding a beat to captain. Thirty years, that's a long time. Then, like that, I saw the whole thirty years wiped out. I raided the wrong place. Messed up the wrong boys. O'Rourke was nice to me. He could have had me kicked off the force, but he let me sit behind a desk because they told him how much I needed my pension. Warren, what would you have done? I don't know. I've never been in that kind of a spot. Hmm. One of the boys... you know that place I raided a year ago? Yeah. It's one of the fellows I roughed up. He was a bookkeeper for the mob. We booked him and mugged him, but o'Rourke got him off. Salvatore Rocco. Salvatore Rocco. Where does he live? 54 Ryder street. A couple of houses down the corner of Ryder and fair. Ryder and fair, huh? How do you do? Is Salvatore Rocco in, please? Salvatore? Yes. Cerca tu Patti. We don't know anything. My mother isn't home. What are you bothering me for? What do you want? You a detective? I'm from the United States treasury department. I knew it. I hope he's in plenty of trouble, him and his fancy chorus girl. - Mama! - Why should you stick up for him? It's over six months now since she even saw her father. But he's good, mama! He sends money. Fifty dollars a month. Conscience money, that's what it is. He spends everything on her. She knows he's a married man. It's a good thing for this family, for his mother, that I'm strong enough to be a janitor. - Where is he now? - I wish I knew. The last I heard, he was working in a horse betting room on Chester street. Every penny he ever made, he lost right back on the horses. Well, when I was here, it must have been about six months ago, was your husband living here then? Yes. Well, this fellow zanger, you remember that picture I showed you? Do you know him? I saw him a few times with Salvatore. Well, why didn't you tell me? Why should I? Salvatore was living here then. Well, this fifty dollars he sends you, how does he send it? He mails it. Well, doesn't the envelope have a return address on it? No. And for the last two months, even they haven't come. - Mama! - Rosa, cry for me, not for him. Excuse me. Listen, please... just... Could I have one of those envelopes? What do you want it for? Please, mrs Rocco. It would... Would help me a great deal. I promise it won't get your husband into any trouble at all. I don't care if it does. Salvatore? Yes, Salvatore, your son. No doubt about it, mr Warren. The handwriting on this envelope matches up with that on the deposit slip. Well, if that cinches it, let's pick up Rocco. No, wait a minute. If this is the fellow that was supposed to contact zanger, he's frightened now. He's laying low. So the thing would be not to pick him up. - Yeah, but, frank... - No, now, now wait a minute. Now, this chorus girl that he's been running... - Oh, you change your mind? - Yeah, a couple of minutes ago. Now, well, look... Forget it, will you. Everybody flies off the handle once in a while. I think we've got the key to the case, though: This fellow Salvatore Rocco. Guess who tipped us off about it? This is gonna surprise you: Shannon. I know. He told me about it in the locker room. And he also told me about his talk with you. Yeah, I'd like to see him. Is he around here somewhere? He's dead. Blew his brains out a few minutes ago. With my gun. For this we get paid! That's her. Not bad. Not bad at all. Cigars! Cigarettes! Candy! Peanuts! Popcorn! Here you are, folks! Cigars, cigarettes... Gladys Laverne? What's on your mind? Look, miss Laverne, I'd like to talk to you for a minute. Oh, sure, sure, I know. You're just passing through town, and you admire my art. Hey, stop surrounding me. I gotta go inside and do another routine this afternoon. Would you give a message to Salvatore Rocco for me? I never heard of the guy. Okay, you never heard of him. But if you do, will you tell him that Manny zanger's friend, frank Warren, would like to do business with him? I told you, I don't know the guy. In case, just in case. We'll be in the drugstore over there across the street, having a cup of coffee during intermission. Okay? Ann! Yeah? Tell the boss I'll be back in time for my next number. Sure, Gladys. Oh, you don't have to worry, sal. I played it straight. I said I'd never heard of you before. That's what I said. I never heard of you before. Look, baby, let's pack and beat it. These cops are federal. You don't have the connections for a federal fix. Baby, this is exactly what I've been waiting for. You think I didn't learn anything working on the syndicate's books? I don't want to hear about it. Let's just pack and get out of here. Mexico, anyplace. I've got some Christmas fund money in the bank. We can use that. Yeah? How much you got? - Seven hundred bucks. - Chicken feed! Now, get this straight. The government doesn't want to do anything to me. They want to do things for me. Remember the zanger deal? Yeah, I remember zanger. Ten per cent of three million bucks. Ten per cent of a bullet in the head. Oh, he wasn't smart. Me, I'm smart. Okay, so we'll go to Mexico. We're gonna go in style. No more two-bit crum joints like this for us, baby. Only the best, you understand? You're crazy. This federal character, you're gonna meet him. Why, sure. I'll do anything you say, sal. You know that. Coffee, black. This is what he told me to tell you. Whatever zanger promised, he'll deliver to you personally. When? Well, he'll arrange it later, but he wants the full share, the whole ten per cent. Will he testify, too? Sure, if he gets protection. Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he wants protection. He'll get it. No cops. Federal protection. He... Fine, fine. One more thing. Yeah? I'm in on this deal. Well, we only pay ten per cent, you know. I don't want any money. I want to go with him. Wherever he goes, I want to go with him. It's a deal. Okay, I'll call him up. - Rosa, telephone for you. - For me? Yes, hurry up. Hello? This is Rosa. Oh, yes, papa! Oh, sure I'm all right, papa. No. I won't say anything. “Who was that? Oh, er... Peggy Donovan, from school, mama. She wants me to come over and do the homework with her. Well, why didn't she tell you at school? - Er... she forgot. - Rosal - Carissima Mia! - Papal hey, hey, hey. I thought you were daddy's big girl now. What's the matter? Aren't you glad to see me? Oh, I'm glad, papa. Very glad. Did your mother ask you where you were going? I said I was going to a friend's house, to do homework. Yeah. How are you doing in school now? What's this? Your report card? And all "a" s! Oh, me with a genius for a daughter! Papa, would you sign it? Me, honey? Why? Teacher always asks why my father never signs it. - Would you sign it, papa? - Oh, Rosa, this is a big honour. On the line where it says "parent's signature”. Someday... someday, Rosa, you and I are gonna take a big trip together, just you and me. And mama”? Rosa, I want you to do something for me. Very important. Anything, papa. You know the old trunk down in the cellar? The one with all those old books of mine? You mean when you studied to be a bookkeeper? That's it. Well, most of them have ordinary printing in them, but there's one... it's a grey book, with little red corners on it. It has numbers in it. You mean, like an arithmetic notebook? That's it. That's exactly right. Now, I want you to get... Beat it, Rosa! Go on home! Papa, what's the matter? I said "beat it!" Papal papal papal papal Papa! Papal papa! Papal Papal Vita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve. Ad te clamamus, exsules, filii hevae. Ad te suspiramus, gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle. Eia ergo, advocata nostra, illos tuos misericordes oculos ad nos converte. Et lesum, benedictum fructum ventris tui, nobis, post hoc exsilium ostende. O clemens, o pia, o dulcis Virgo Maria. I just wanted to tell you that... I'm very sorry. Cop! Murderer! - Mrs Rocco, stop that. - Liar! The door was open. Mr o'Rourke, if I could be bought, what do you think? Has my price gone up or down since this beating? - Hmm? - I'd say "up". That's what I thought you'd say. Only not for that reason. Choose any reason you want. All right. I choose the reason that you're worried. What have I got to be worried about? What did you have the place searched for? Oh, I'm not responsible for the action of my clients. Oh, yes, that's right. I keep forgetting that. How long you been with the syndicate? Are you investigating me, too, mr Warren? No, but you know I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it didn't end up that way. I spoke to Rocco a few hours before he was killed. - You never talked to Rocco. - What makes you so sure? I'm sure. What else are you sure about? That either you're a very honest man or a very stupid one. Now, is there any difference between the two, in your opinion? What's your opinion? Oh, I have no opinion. No, I just deal in facts. Facts and figures. All right, I'll submit a fact, then a figure. On behalf of my client, I offer a settlement. Figure? Twenty-five per cent of what you claim he owes. In return for? All criminal charges dropped. And against you, too? I find that a pathetic stab in the dark. Well? I'll pass your offer on. To the government. You're in a position to recommend... What do you think my recommendation would be? Hmm? Ah, now I am sure. “What of? That you're a very stupid man. What are you trying to prove, and who are you trying to prove it to? Who cares? If anybody cared, men like my client couldn't exist. Or men like yourself. You've been on this case a long time now, mr Warren. Has one man or woman come forward voluntarily to you, and said: "I don't care what happens to me, "or to my family, or to what I own"? No. Those who came to you, men like, er... zanger... - And Rocco. - You never saw Rocco, or talked to him. They came to you out of greed, because they thought that what they would get would be worth the risk. As a bookkeeper, a man who deals in facts and figures, you should know that. Is the game worth the risk? It's as simple as that, mr Warren. Is the game worth the risk? Think about it. You and I, mr Warren, are civilised people. We can sit here in this room, and discuss things calmly. Mmm, very calmly. My clients, however, are, er... Men of violence. So I've noticed. I can't impress that fact upon you too strongly. Look, I'm impressed. I'm impressed. Well, I'll be off. Take good care of yourself. And, er... Oh yes, I forgot to ask you. What? How's your wife? Oh yes, I forgot to ask you. How's your wife? The collectors, almost all of them. The joints, every single one of them. How much money they got, and who's got it. Please, I don't know anything. I didn't see anything. Nobody saw anything. Nobody ever does. I used to be a good cop. Then he blew his brains out. Cop! Murderer! Butcher! My clients, however, are men of violence. I forgot to ask you, how's your wife? My clients, however, are men of violence. I forgot to ask you, how's your wife? How's your wife? How's your wife? Hello! Ho ho! Go get 'im, bill, old boy! - You'll be leaving tomorrow. - Yeah. I was so glad you could get away, even for a few days. You see that sign there? It says "any reasonable offer". I haven't had a reasonable offer in a long time. - You haven't? - Mm-mmm. Well... Okay, I've got one for you now. How'd you like to be a... Be a farmer's wife, hmm? I've been a farmer's daughter. You know, a guy like me just shouldn't have such a beautiful wife, you know? I love you, too. I bet you forgot you even had a husband. Completely. Yeah. Spent all my time shopping around for a new one. What did you find? Can't get a new one without a trade-in. Well, see... that's what I... I guess I'll have to stick to the one I got. That's right. You know, I was talking to your father. He says that that, er... Smith place, there, could be made to pay in a little while. You're thinking of quitting, aren't you, frank? I'm just thinking of our future, that's all. Look, this is Judy, your wife, remember? All right, I... I am thinking of quitting. “When? Now. Is it because you can't beat the case? No, I've had tough cases before. It isn't that. Is it because of what happened the other day with that guy Rocco? We get city newspapers up here, too. L... I... I just can't put my finger on exactly what it is, or... Is it because you're worried about me? - No, I... - Don't lie to me, frank. That's why you came up here, isn't it? Yes. Did they threaten? I don't know. I... I'm not sure. Look, I can leave here, frank. Go back to Washington. There's no need for you to worry. It's easy to arrange for protection. The government's done it before. Protection? Look, if they don't do it this time, they'll do it some other time. This... I mean, this is no life for you, or for me, this running around, never being able to settle down. Always on the run. I... I'm fed up with it. I'm sick of it. Have you talked with anybody about it? George or Stan? Oh, what do I want to talk to them for? They've got their lives to lead, and we've got our lives to lead. And besides, a guy has to look out for himself. He's got to look out for his family. I've never heard you talk this way before. Oh, I've never felt this way before. Are you sure, frank? Are you very sure this is what you want to do? Well, I'm sure of one thing. I'm sure that I love you, and I want you alive. If you had any brains, you'd be leaving, too. Gin! You've got a wife and a kid, Stan. Why sit around here like a Clay pigeon? - You get thirty-four points. - You can get a job anywhere. Haven't got a contract with the government. You can walk out anytime. Me, I'm just a character without responsibilities, a white-collar hobo. Give me a job, and a little money, and a soft bed in a hotel, and I'm happy. - But you've got a... - Lay off, will you! George, leave him alone. Look, frank... “What? I don't want you to get the idea I'm sore, because I'm not. I'm just jealous. Come in. Scusa, please. Dumannacci scusa p'aviri vinuta accussi tardu. My grandmother wishes to beg your pardon for coming here so late. Well, you tell your grandmother that she's welcome here anytime. Er... sit down, won't you? - Please, sit down. - Iddudici, nenti, s'assetta. Scusa. Thank you. Those are the only words my grandmother knows. Dicci chiddru chi ti dissi di la bonarmuzza di to patri. Tucci la diri. Grandmother wants you to know... She does not blame you for my father's death. Continua beddra Mia. Grandmother says that papa died because these are evil days, because people will not speak out against evil men. She says we will pray for you to make better days for everybody. Tell your... Tell your grandmother that I'm very grateful, but that I'm leaving. Iddru dici che la ringrazzia, pero sta lassannu u so post... Picchi? Comu? Sta lassannu u so postu? Ma chi? Ncarugniu? She asks if you are leaving your post of duty. Yes. Chistu, e comu quannu un vidi fari una cosa mala e scappa, immeci di prutistari. Grandmother says this is the same as when people see evil and run away. When people will not speak out against evil. Tanti anni nnarre quannu in era all' italia. She says that, in Italy, many years ago... Cu me maritu e du figli, nda ogni paisi c'era la mafia, la manu niura... She had a husband and two sons, and there was the mafia, the black hand, in every village. Tutti avianu a pagari un pizzu o I'ammazzevanu, me maritu sta camurraa un la vosi mai pagari 'ammazzaru. Everybody was ordered to pay them, or die. But her husband, my grandfather, never wanted to pay them. They killed him. Lu, mischina scantata piglavu I me figli e scappavu. Fici una sbagliu. Avia ristari a cummattiri sta mafia, sti malfattura sfuttatura du populu. A costu di muriri. Grandmother says what she did then was a mistake. She ran away with her sons. Would have been better had she stayed, and fought those gangsters and leeches, even to die. Ma, io avia ntisu parlari d'America, comu tutti eranu libriri, travagliu pi tutti paga bona, scoli franci pi tutti. But she heard about America, how it was free for everyone, work for everybody, good pay, free schools for all. Comu ée Bella America! Grandmother says it's very beautiful here in America. Dunacci un libru. This book is for you, mr Warren. My father had me get it for him, the day he was killed. I told my grandmother about it. That's why we came to see you. E tardu, iamuninni. Grandmother says it's late, and now we must go. Mi dici che un é veru che vossia sta disertannu. Grandmother asks if you will desert? No. No. Binidittu. Scusa, please. Gentlemen, this book the little Rocco girl gave you contains a gold mine of information. The writing of Salvatore Rocco on this envelope is the same, without any question, as that on these April entries. The subway club was the horse joint that Shannon raided. Rocco must have held out his book of accounts, and told his boss that Shannon seized everything. Another hand made these entries, the hand of a trained accountant, a bookkeeper, a man who was precise and neat, almost painstakingly so. He's the one you'll be looking for. He's the man you need to crack your case. Happy now? Sure, I'm happy. Tomorrow... "Tomorrow"'s a word. It spells o'Rourke, the syndicate, those men from the treasury. Maybe it doesn't, Sydney. How'd we ever get mixed up in a mess like this? They're murderers. Look what they did to Rocco. We were crazy to run away. Honey, it was the only sensible thing to do. Now, we're really free. Maybe they won't ever find us. Maybe... Mr Gordon? Yeah? No. No! Sorry, mr Gordon, we'll have to take you in. This your wife? This way, gentlemen. Hello, Gordon. Go on, sit down. What are you holding me for? We want you to tell us about these entries here. I don't know what you're talking about. You kept those accounts. You and Salvatore Rocco. You can't prove a thing. That the writing on this card, your handwriting, is identical to the writing in this ledger. You got no right to hold me here. We're holding you as a material witness. - Can I use the phone? - Not yet. I've got a right to call a lawyer, haven't I? O'Rourke? You ran away from him. Why? Now, let me get this straight, Gordon. You insist now... You insist that you did not write, you did not make any entries into this ledger, eh? - No. - All right. Honestly, I... I just can't help you. Er... get me associated press office, Los Angeles, please. This is a police emergency call. Oh, news editor. Yeah. Look, this is the sheriff's sub-station, Malibu. Will you send a reporter down here sometime today? What? We'll give you the details later. Oh, yes, er... send a photographer along, will you? Yeah. Now, Gordon, I don't want you to worry about a thing. We're only gonna hold you here for twenty-four hours. Long enough for the papers to run the story and, er... - And your picture. - What story? What? Oh, the story... The story that you gave us vital information on the syndicate. Now, if you don't know anything, it won't hurt you. O'Rourke and the others will understand. However, if you, er... Do have some vital information, some vital evidence for us, why, the odds are they'll probably send somebody out here to kill you. And probably it'll be the men who killed Rocco. Where's my wife? Take it easy, kid. They won't shoot at us. Coast guard's part of the treasury department. You see, this is all my fault, mr Warren. I... It was nobody's fault. I was out of work. I wanted a job that paid good money. We wanted to get married. One of my neighbours was working at a horse-betting room. He got me a job there at a hundred dollars a week. It was the easiest money I ever made. But Sydney didn't want that job, mr Warren, honestly, but I made him take it. You must understand. Sydney isn't a... A criminal. He... - He's a good accountant. - Sure. So good that o'Rourke doubled my salary, and took me on to do his personal work. Everything was perfect. We never worried about the future. Why'd you run away? I was frightened when they arrested Sydney. And then, suddenly, it hit me that what we were doing was wrong. So I made Sydney get in the car, and drive us out here, to try to leave all those things behind. It was beginning to be pretty wonderful, these last few days. We felt free, for the first time in a long time. Well, if your husband's testimony is what we think it is, every member of the syndicate will be in prison, and you'll never have to worry again. Never have to be afraid again. Now, Gordon... yeah? Now, look, as one bookkeeper to another, figure the percentage. Well, what about my wife? Well, I'll tell you. How would you... How would you two like to have a nice, long ocean voyage together? With me along to watch you, at government expense. What do you wanna know? Well, the first thing you can do is, you can start out by identifying the initials above these payments right here. Well, you've probably guessed the initials stand for... "The big fellow." Sydney Gordon, please. Well, here goes nothing. I hope you're gonna be able to convict them, mr Warren. Not just the big fellow, but all of them at the top. It's not that I'm frightened. I am, you know. But, if you don't... Well, it's like I said, "here goes nothing." Sure, the syndicate got half. I collected. Whaddaya wanna know? Just tell me. Whaddaya wanna know? I don't take nobody's rap. The big fellow got his cut of everything. In my thirty years as a cop, I've never seen anything like it. Pigeons, singing everywhere! I leave my home in the morning, one perches on my shoulder. I go into a restaurant for coffee, there's one hiding in the sugar bowl, chirping away. Heard any good songs lately? There's one little number. I don't know the tune, but here's the words: "O'Rourke", as in Edward j o'Rourke! You're late. I was held up at the court house. I think we got a break. A postponement. - Whose idea was that? - My idea. Well, this is mine. Give him the list. What's this? The names of every man and woman on the jury panel. Eighty-three of them. Only twelve of them are going to be picked. We're taking no chances. Your job is to get to the ten names 30 through 39. What if they can't be bought? That's our job. - Number seven, five times, - Number seven. Well, gentlemen, are you visiting me, or the horses? Greetings, mr o'Rourke, from your fellow citizen. You know, I don't like to say anything, but you're in an awful lot of trouble. You know what you need? You need a good lawyer. Hmm, yeah. Now, if you want to talk to me about that, you know where you can reach me. Mr Warren, I can see nothing for us to talk about. - Fellas, I got a hunch. - On a horse? Yeah, named o'Rourke. I've got a hunch he's gonna turn into a canary, in a cage. Come here. It'll ring whether you walk or you stand still. So stand still, honey. I'm gonna wear a belt. Every time I... Yeah? O'Rourke. Get my coat, will you, honey? Yeah. Yes? All right. You taking this alone? Yes. You want pappas and me to meet you anyplace? Nope. I see that neither wind, nor rain, nor the syndicate's men have kept you from your rounds. Well, after six months of your hoods stepping on my heels, I've picked up a few tricks myself. I used to play ball on this lot when I was a kid. Yeah, I was raised around here. Later, when I went on to college, I even got semi-pro offers. You should have taken 'em. No, I wasn't interested in peanuts. I wanted big money. You got it, too. When we confiscated your safe-deposit box, we counted over six hundred thousand dollars in cash. I'll pay my taxes, and whatever penalties are required. Uh-uh. It's too late, o'Rourke. It's never too late for a trade. The inside financial set-up of the syndicate. Zanger? Zangers are made, not born. The complete accounts of profits of the big fellow, and the other top men. In return for? Dropping the case against me. Oh, that wouldn't be a very good deal for you. The syndicate would kill you the minute this evidence was introduced into court. It's a good deal. When you arrested Sydney Gordon, I told the syndicate that he had stolen these papers. - Does Gordon know about that? - Of course. He prepared them. You can use them in his testimony. So, my name need never be mentioned. And what will you be doing? Defending my clients, of course, to the utmost of my ability. They are still men of violence. Even more so, now. They don't like double-crosses. Is it a deal? No, not now. I tell you what, we'll talk about it later, after the big fellow's trial. Warren! “What? I've something extra to throw into this trade. What are you peddling now, shyster? The jury panel is fixed. Every one of the panel, all 83 of them, have been reached. Paid off, or frightened into guaranteeing acquittals. I don't believe it. No. Even we... We don't know the names on that panel. The big fellow does. He bought the list a week ago. He showed it to me. He even gave me my assignment. Those ten names, numbers 30 through 39 on the panel, were my assignment. I played it safe with the big fellow. I went out and fixed those ten. You can have that, in exchange for my subpoena. Every stool pigeon gets paid. That's one of the rules, isn't it, o'Rourke? Thank you. Gimme the keys. Get in the car. I was sent here by the big fellow. Give me the keys to the car. To make a deal. For who, yourself? Get in the car. That's stupid. - Think I gave that fed the list? - You did. I saw you. - I've got it right here in my pocket. - Who are you kiddin'? All right, then, if I did give him the list, you'll want him more than you want me. We were told to bring you back with us. - But if I did make a deal... - Get in the car. You stupid stoop! Hold it. Go ahead. If they convict, the big fellow gets twenty years. If he loses, you lose, too. But, if I make a deal... Warren! Wait... wait a minute, will you? Don't be a fool. I'll get him to go back with you. Then if he's... if I'm lying, you've got both of us. All right, but remember, if you try to get cute, you'll get it right in the back. I told them I'd made a deal with you. You did? I told them you'd go back with me. Walk on the outside. As soon as you get a chance, reach in your pocket, and get rid of the list I gave you. Drop it, tear it up, anything. I put it in the mailbox. Don't play hero with me. I'm just as scared as you are, my friend. All right, then do what I tell you. Get into that car with me. As soon as we get back to the big fellow's hotel, I'll tell him you've gone for the fix. You've got to go for the fix. It's your life. How much time did they give you to talk to me? What have you got on your mind? Judge Parker. Judge Parker? Warren, treasury department. Has the jury been selected yet? Good. Well, the entire panel has been fixed. I have the list. That's right. All right, I'll get there just as quick as I can. - The judge is waiting for you. - Thank you. Hello, Warren. Come in. This arrived ten minutes ago. Let me see those names you have. 30 through 39. We'll see... There they are. This was supposed to be a first copy. Tell the district attorney I want him. There can't be any trial tomorrow. Postponing the trial isn't going to solve anything, your honour. How long do you think we can hold onto our witnesses? Have the defendants wait. - Is the panel assembled? - Yes, your honour. Ladies and gentlemen, on all panels there are some who, in good conscience, feel they cannot serve. Will those who wish to be excused, please stand up. I am impressed, ladies and gentlemen. You all are willing to serve as good citizens. For reasons best known to this court, I have arranged with judge Thompson in part two to exchange jury panels. I'm sure judge Thompson will be happy to receive such a fine panel of citizens. Bailiffs, remove this panel, and bring in the new one. Come on, break it up, break it up. Come on, come on. Come on, buddy, this doesn't concern you. Subtitles by powerhouse films ltd
