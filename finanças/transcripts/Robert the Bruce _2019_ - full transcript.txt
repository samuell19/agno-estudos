After the death of William Wallace, Robert the Bruce sought, once and for all, to claim the throne of Scotland. The deal had been made, but Bruce lands would be signed over to the Comyn clan, and in return, John Comyn would relinquish his claim to the throne. It was cold that day. A bitter chilling wind blew, dragging snow against the hills and the frozen walls of Gray Friar's Church. They agreed to meet on holy ground and to parlay unarmed. But since William Wallace had failed to win Scotland her freedom, the lands had been in chaos, and there was little trust between the clans. Robert, good to see you. We have much to do if we are to join our lands together. We must change the legacy left behind by William Wallace. The years have not suffered the sentiment he aroused. And if we are to combine our power under England, we cannot have thousands of our people and several powerful clans still clamoring for revolution. What is that? The Bruce knew. Even as they had struck their bargain, John Comyn had conspired to have him arrested for treason and killed. Well, we can dispense with the frivolous chatter, for you came to me and pledged to turn over your lands in exchange for my support of you as king. Are you not betraying England then? And did you intend to let me keep those lands once you were crowned king? Huh? Come, Robert. Do not play the saint, not you. You laid a trap for Edward, which he escaped. I laid a trap for you, which you escaped. Tomorrow you lay a trap to me, which I escape. And so it goes until we are both old men, like our fathers before us. And still, this look of war in your eyes. You really must learn to control your temper, Robert. It'll be your death. The commons men laid in wait, but the Bruce's men stood against them, led by the great warrior James Douglas. But Ma. What, Scot? Robert the Bruce slit John Comyn's throat in church so he could steal the crown for himself. Just tell him the story, Scot. But that's not what happened. That was years ago. How could you know what happened? Uncle Brandubh told me. Ay, your uncle tells it his way, I tell it mine. But it's not the truth. Shh. I know how it happened. Would you like me to go on? Would you rather go to sleep now? Oh, Robert. Robert, Robert. I have an eye on you. You want the one thing you cannot have, to be William Wallace, to be loved as he was, to be brave like him, be free like him. What a wretched wish that is for you to have. How it must coil in your gut. Is that what you want now, to throw yourself upon my sword and die today, to be, for a moment, a hollow, empty echo of the man William Wallace was? Proceed, if you must. No? You, uh, don't have one of these, do you? And that is why Robert the Bruce failed in his bids to become king of Scotland. Come on. A great fight ensued, both men champions, both battle-hardened. They fought for the crown, the supremacy of their clans, and for the future of Scotland. For the Bruce will fight for freedom, but the Comyn was a puppet of the English crown. When the church doors burst open, with the fire of behind the figure that emerged, no one knew at first who it was. Was it the Bruce or the Comyn, the Comyn or the Bruce? They're dreaming now. Do you think we'll ever fight again? It's been years since the Bruce was crowned. Six battles loss. Uncle Brandubh says he's got no army to speak of. Calls him the pretender king. I don't know, Carney, but I know I'd never call him that. Now help me with the bucket. In just six years, we ruled this country, didn't we, you and I, without a royal ambition. Three days, maybe four, we'll be safe in [inaudible].. Will we ever go home? You miss your Ma? I miss my Ma, too. Your Ma and Pa lived in a bigass castle, though, didn't they? The castle, ay. Ay. It's where I was born. It's home. All around at the fields and forests, where I played as a wee lad. Can we go there? The English took it from him, lad. Now some fat pig has his ass plopped in his fancy chair and his fancy table. One day, ay. Oh, aye. One day we'll be sat around that table, aye, eating boar, drinking claret. That man there, he's going to free Scotland. I'm going to take back my castle. I'm going to stick that English pig on the end of my sword and I'm going to fling him over my castle wall. And you'll go home, too, a wee bit older, more man than boy. You'll see your Ma again. After winter, you'll see. We'll not go to Norway. Leave me. Go home to your families. We're done. And if anyone asks you, whatever happened to Robert the Bruce, you tell them you know not. You tell them you fought with the Comyn and the English all along. Go home. Go. Stop this talk now. You're the king. God chooses kings, James, not men. We're done fighting, lad. What were we fighting for? Go home, he says. Tell them we were fighting for Comyn all along. I've heard Comyn has 50 pieces for him, gold. Time to be free from James. It's regicide. It's a sin. We don't have to kill him, only capture. There's a reward on your head. You're not safe on your own. I'll not stop fighting for you, for Scotland. Look at those faces, James. Look at them. They're done. Have no fight left in them. We're done here. On your own, lads. But first do the work, Hamish. Try to set the hook too soon, she'll leap right off. If you let her nibble a bit and set the hook herself, she won't get away. Take that. Good, lad. Where are you three headed then? The homes to the south, I reckon? Aye, so his his. He's after the reward, same as us. Ah, the reward, 50 gold pieces. Is that your prize? There's three of us, James. You know it wouldn't matter if there were 10, would it? You I had for a decent man. Your music has been very dear to me these past few months, you. I've never liked you anyway, but I fought next to you and I'd have died for you as a countryman. It's over, James. The Bruce failed. Robert the Bruce never lost those battles, you did, and the men like you. You failed them, and now you chase after them, after some reward. Either we do it or someone else will. Judas, traitors all. Now. Hamish. What are you doing? Stay out of it. James. No. James. You didn't need to kill Hamish. He was armed. Aye, with an ax, he could barely swing. And it was going in his back. He's a child. Leave him. He's still breathing. What are you doing? He knows where we're going. James Douglas is not dying like this. He knows where we're going. Say a prayer. Say a prayer. I can make you free now, can't I? Your day be filled with blessings, like the sun that lights the sky. You'll always have the courage to spread their wings and fly. Don't you thank me? Ma. Don't. Ma. Don't make me. Ma. En garde. En garde. I got you now. Scot. Scot. Here, help me gather these. En garde. I am helping you. Thank you, good sir. Did we lose then? We won. Good. Now help me fill this basket. Of course, my lady. Who do you think you are? I'm the king. Is that enough? We're not done. That's so pretty. Look at that. Beautiful. Like you. For your father. Kneel with me, if you'd like. Would you like to say something? Bless you. He should've never left us. [inaudible] for English. Find the king and kill him. Scot. I do. Do you think he hears us, Ma? Aye. Back home? Aye. Horse went that way. He's going that way. Aye. How about the horses? What, you think yours can go where his can't? Michael's got a magic horse. All right, he's gone up this way. Left to pieces, lads. Left to pieces. Scot, go wash your hands. But my hands are filthy. [inaudible] That's your favorite. One more scoop? Aye, finish that first. It's my birthday. One more scoop. Scot. How is your day, Scot? Good so far. What did you get me? A present, as always. Did you feed the goats, [inaudible]?? Aye. All right. We thank you for Scot, for today we celebrate the beginning of his 11th year. He's going to be a good lad. Although sometimes he might be a little wild, he trusts in You. He's a good boy, a good son. I pray for Scotland and for our king, that you guide him and give him strength. We pray that you protect us during the winter ahead, that we may have food and that we may stay safe. Amen. Amen. Amen. [inaudible] Tell the story, Ma. No more. It's my birthday. Ma, start at the church. She means the violent bit. All right. Now the Bruce had disarmed John Comyn. When word spread what had happened, Robert the Bruce was excommunicated from the holy church and brandished a villain, and the priests of Scotland crowned him king. His family was taken from him, his wife Elizabeth, his wee princess Monterey. He took up the mantle William Wallace had carried to fight for Scotland's freedom. [inaudible] the vast English army and the clans that refused to support the cause. For many years, he fought. For many years, he lost again and again. He fought until the rivers flowed red with Scottish blood, until he was hunted like an animal, by English and Scotland alike. Hit him, men. [inaudible] ahead. Over Robert the Bruce. Shall we see the son of [inaudible] gone to pieces? But one day soon, he'll raise another army and he'll fight again. Maybe one of you will fight with him. Not me. He'll win and we'll all be free. Bless him, and the first look at near death. Did you know? Aye, I did. I really did. If you do see a strange man in the forest, tell me. I am. [inaudible] down by the lock. Go and see you [inaudible]. We're soldiers. We need food. On [inaudible], if you have any. Who do you fight for, Robert the Bruce or John Comyn? My father fought with Robert the Bruce at [inaudible].. Is that so? Aye. He was very brave. Robert the Bruce even said so himself. Daddy? Aye. He told us stories. Get back. Go on. Where is he now, still fight with the Bruce? He died. We're with the Comyn clan, lad, as should you be. Your lords have pledged themselves to him. My father fought with William Wallace, too. Oh, aye? Aye. Scotland died with Wallace, if you ask me. We offer our gratitude for your food. We'll be leaving. Unless you'd like us to stay. Will? Widow could use a helping hand. I said we'll be going. [inaudible] Can you use a helping hand? I said we'll be going. Yes, we're leaving. Ma. You best leave us now. You're going to be a hero, are you? He won't have to. I'll show you what happens [inaudible].. Out, all right? Scots attack Scots to what end? Aye. One day we'll all be free. One day we'll all be dead. Michael's down. All right, I'm coming. Hey. Hey. I'm hurt. Who are you? I'm a soldier. I need help. And who are you a soldier for? Can't you see I'm hurt? I'm the Sheriff. Who are you for? We were following Robert the Bruce. We stand by the river. And he? They're dead. He's killed him. But he's hurt bad, and I'm sure you know there's 50 pieces for him. I'll take you to him and we'll share it, aye? Aye. Thomas, give him your horse. Hey, show me. If you tell the truth, we'll help you. Aye. Donald, Finley, go with me. Now lead the way. Hey, it's him. It's just under here. You see. This is Bruce's sword. He couldn't have gone far. He's winded. What do you say? Will you help? Aye. You will not feel the pain for long. I'm sorry, lad. Let's go. Anyone who hears of this will seek the reward. But if it's him, we'll have it for ourselves, 50 gold pieces. Won't matter, the size of your sword then, Finley. You'll be rich. The sword could be his. It's old enough. Whether we find him or no, this remains a secret among ourselves. We tell no one, neither man nor woman. Hey, if anyone learns of this, I'll know it's you. Know where you come. Same as [inaudible],, you understand? Aye. You'd fight him to the death, our king. He's no king of mine. Think of the men, fathers, sons, brothers, stolen from us for his vanity. We'll find him dead, most likely. But if not, I crave a chance to fight him. Freedom, I'll show him the meaning of it. Sit down, you stupid boy. Robert, Robert the Bruce, come out and see me. Can you hear me? Robert. Robert. Robert the Bruce, can you hear me? Robert, can you hear me? Robert the Bruce, can you hear me? You're among friends. We'll take care of your wounds, give you food. Do you think he's in the mountains? If he is, we'll need to leave our horses here. No, I think that he'll go downhill. Robert. Robert the Bruce, can you hear me? Robert. Robert the Bruce. You're among friends. Ah, children. Although Carney, you're no longer a boy. Iver, get the horse tied up. Hi, there. Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes. Uncle. Oh, Scott, you wee scoundrel. Come here, nephew. I brought you something for your birthday. Did you? There you go. Someone has to give Iver some competition at the games. You've not got a chance. I'll in it next year. Oh, you'll have to practice, boy. I know. And guess what? What? Soldiers were here earlier. Carney scared them off. How do you know that? Well, Ma gave some food, but one of them got mean. Did they? Aye. Carney, come. Iver, maybe you can show my men how to should an arrow. Both of you, run along. Brandubh. You [inaudible] Yorgi on Sunday. Every day. My brother was a lucky man till death claimed him. Carney. Hello, bonnie darling. Carney, come. This sword is chipped, see, here and here. It's dented here. Needs repairing. Whose is it? It belongs to a noble. Could bring it to old Sean in the village, but I know you've been learning from him. Get better praise for your work now than he gets for his. So finish it over the winter and show him your skill, maybe even prove yourself to his daughter, huh? We'll need gold for the handle. You'll have that. The work must be perfect. Hey, take it and go. Would you like something to drink? So there were soldiers here? Aye. One of them was trouble? Oh, it was nothing. We were safe. For how long? Don't you ever think about living in the village? We're happy here. [inaudible] I want to help you. You do help. My house is safe, large, warm, and lonely. I say [inaudible]. When you were my sister-in-law, you used to love to listen to those songs. They're dead, you know, those men. I killed them. You'd never need to fear for strangers if you lived in the village. [inaudible] Well, this will be my last time up here before the snow melts. When I return, I'll be taking Carney. You have no right. He's of age and has a duty to the clan. It's only a kindness to you that I don't take him now. Besides, how much longer will he be able to stay here when old Sean's daughter's waiting for him in the village. Come with him. Find the rest of your [inaudible].. I'll take care of the lot of you. [inaudible],, but you will come to me. Carney. I'm here for your father. Craftsmanship, hand [inaudible] master that is smooth, strong. Listen, boy. You're still my apprentice, turn again and again and again and again and again. Brandubh said you'll seal the gold. Not here. Far from here, France maybe. Boom biddy boom biddy boom goes the hammer. Tappity tappity tappity tap. Gold? Aye. How much did he give you for it? Tell Briana to fetch me ale. Let me go, Briana. No. You'll have to fight me for passage. All right. Briana. See you after the winter. I don't believe him. Brandubh. It's the finest sword I've ever seen. Brandubh is not a man to be trifled with. Whose is it? Scot says he saw a man in the forest. Scot is always the boy who cries wolf. You know that. Now get to bed before you wake the children. I'm not a child. You always had a grown way about you. I love you like a son. I must do what I believe is right. Aye. Brandubh's a dog. When my son was born, you told me the dream. You'd seen him, that you'd seen him on the battlefield. You told me he was with Robert the Bruce. I remember. The soldiers were cheering because they'd won their fight. But you said more. You said more. What you saw, will it come to pass? Will my Scot die? It was just a dream. There was a premonition. He was in his 11th year. You cannot stop your boy from becoming a man. Nothing's certain of the future, not even the present. I'm scared. You have to let go. No. You have to let go. Hey, I understand. I understand. The spider's web must be spun. Lost souls journey must be won. The king's delight must be undone. The song of justice must be sung. Who do you side with, the Bruce or the Comyn? The Comyn. Comyn. Let go. Let go. Shh. Shh. Shh. Stop. Stop. Shh. Let Iver kill him. Shh. I can do it. Carney. I hit him. Nice shot. I could've done it. Move his legs. That was a perfect shot. Carney. Iver. Carney. Is he awake? Who is he? Can you tell? It's Robert the Bruce, I already told you. I think he's dead. Check his chest. He's alive. Help me move him. Quick, help me find the [inaudible].. You'll be rich. Children, that man in there, and we know who he is. Our lives are in great danger with him in the croft. Uncle Brandubh would kill him. [inaudible] He's our king. But Ma. Scot, quiet. We'd be rich. His life is in our hands. Now, it's God's will he came here. If we help him, we'll have to leave, won't we? Brandubh will learn of it. Thinking of Briana. You're right. He's our king. We have a duty to him. That's his sword. Brandubh lied to me. He'll kill him, won't he, and us. Brandubh lost men he loved to the Bruce's horse. Yorgi, his friends. He'll always bear a grudge. Not a word. Come inside. Children, I need your help. There's something in there. Was that from a sword? Maybe. Help me get him out of sight. Get a cloth. Put it down here, Scot. Put one in the water. Down there. You need to watch. He'll bleed. I'm not afraid of blood, Ma. All right. Clean it. See to him, Iver. Ma. He kicked me in the chest. Be quiet, Scot. Get me a cloth. Ma, he hurt me. That was shock is all. [inaudible] care. His leg. Aye. Carney, the knife. All right, hold him down. Iver, hold him. Ready? Hold him down. Hold him. Carney, here. Tie it. Tie it tight. Good. Iver, Carney, back to your work. Scot, come here. Are you hurt? Where? My dad told me, son, none are safe once the fight has begun. They've taken everything, our brothers, fathers, sons. You stole my heart. They've taken our weapons. They take, they take, they take until they've had their fill. 'Cause when there's nothing left to love, then it's time to kill. She's a witch. Shh. Watch out for her. Shh. You're not welcome here, witch. You're not still pining over that Morag, are you? Oh, love that pains will always pain. Her heart belongs forever to your brother. You best shut your mouth. I will not. Shall I buy you a wee dram, [inaudible]?? I see what I see. A man like you, handsome as you are, important as you are, you're no wild thistle. But you'll be rich after the winter, won't you? What are you doing? I didn't say nothing. You'll tell everyone you're just running your mouth about the Bruce. It's a laugh is all. Anyone [inaudible] when the snow melts, I'll slit your bloody throat. The English is gone. You're the king now. We won? The spider's web must be spun. The king's delight must be undone. Lost soul's journey must be won. The song of justice must be sung. Who are you? The spider's web must be spun. Lost soul's journey must be won. The king's delight must be undone. The song of justice must be sung. It's too far away. He's got 100 excuses. When someone comes to kill the king, we'll have to fight. You won't be able to fight him hand-to-hand. Sure I will. You're not strong enough. First sign of anything, you get your bow and your quiver and you run to that tree. Iver, you climb your perch there. Aye. As soon as fighting starts, you do what you can, all right? I don't want to fight them. Aye. I know. We all have to protect your Ma. I have to protect you, too. If we have to fight, Iver, come on. I give the orders or else someone might die. It might be him or Iver or me or you, but it could be your Ma. We're family, aye? Aye. Now take your bow, try again. Be patient this time. Ready? Aye. That was closer. You'll get even closer. Bruce, are they coming? Bruce? He'll lose this fight. We'll see about that. Now you're going to die. Ma. Ma. Ma. Your fever's broken. I know you. No. No, you don't. I saw you. Leave me alone. You were frozen when Scot found you. Rest now. Run along. May I? Your wounds are healing. It was all a dream. The fever? Freedom. Victory. Nothing. Robert. Robert the Bruce. This is my elder nephew, Carney. This is my younger niece, Iver. And there's my boy, Scot. Please, take a seat. Carney was barely a year when the Wallace began to fight. Our clan was going to England, and it was decreed that anyone who joined him would be an outlaw. So my brother Toag decided to join him. I pleaded with him not to. He seemed so proud when he went off to fight. Carney cried. He cried. He cried for his father. Your father went to fight with King Robert. He cried, too. No, he didn't. Yeah, he did. My other brother, Boak, he was older than me by six years. He was an archer, same as Iver. Aye, so you're an archer? So am I. She's good. The men in the village have trouble keeping up with her [inaudible]. Toag never knew he was a father. His mother died when she was born and, just days later, Boak had fallen at [inaudible].. I had the two wee children. Ma, tell about the poem. Toag was a poet. After [inaudible] died, Toag composed a song. There's blood... In the locks. There is blood in the house, on the rocks and mountain peaks. And when we look up to our Maker, the sky burns, brushed with a scarlet ink of those hearts we loved. Do not lose hope, the bleeding sky will not succumb to the shadow that darkens this land, for [inaudible] the sun rising above the dirty house, as the dawn, a new day. That's beautiful. Your father wrote that? Aye. Now mine. Tell him about him. He was a good man, and good with the sword. And word came that you've been [inaudible] and were fighting for our freedom. Our clan pledged themself to you and raised up an army. My Yorgi, he was the younger son. His older brother, Brandubh, he should have gone. But he was a Sheriff so he stayed behind and my Yorgi went in his place. Brandubh is still the Sheriff. Yorgi was with you at [inaudible],, but he was hurt. They cut off his leg before the journey home. He was near gone when he arrived. Our clan lost faith and placed themselves to the Comyn. My Yorgi still believed in you. He told us that no matter what the odds, no matter how difficult the fight, you wouldn't give up. He would have fought the clan to join you again. But his wounds festered. He died right there, as you are now. So you think you can make them? Can I make them he asks? Of course I can make them. Devil spikes though they are, but I make them. My men will be bringing you their weapons for sharpening as well, all to be done before the snows melt. So pretty. Away they go, steel shining in the sunlight, singing songs, and smiling. Away they go I'll give them spikes. Away they go, never to be seen again. Thank you, Briana. Aye. Before the snow melts, you say? Aye. Children, head down to the river and set the traps. Aye, Ma. Not now, I'm cleaning the barn. Do as I say. Wait there. You're not supposed to be hunting. Come help me set this. Wait, Carney. Aim, don't just shoot. With your eyes, Scot. Look at him with your eyes. I know how to do it. But [inaudible] will follow. It's your fault for talking. I just told you. I can do it myself. Iver, Scot, quit quarreling and help me set the traps. You should have aimed. I did aim. Shut it, both of you. I don't see why we have to set traps anyway. We have all that venison stored up. Your Ma said so. It's for the Bruce. She wants more meat. Should have left him where he was. He's a man. Couldn't have just let him die. My dad died because of him, and so did yours and yours. Why can't we tell Uncle Brandubh about him? We made a promise, Scot. What if he lives and raises an army? What if our lord side with him again? He'll go and fight. What then? Just set the traps. Amen. When will you fight again? Scot. I want to know. Do you have a plan? I don't have an army here. They're your army. What about you? I reckon they'll kill you in your sleep. Take the [inaudible]. Scot. My lord. Have you ever killed before? Aye What? Chickens. Uh-huh. Squirrel, elk, pigs. You ever killed a man? You're a good lad. He's strong, full of life. But you know what it takes to be a good soldier? Lots of men. No. To be a good soldier, first you have to be a good brother, a good friend, and a good son. I am a good son, aren't I, Ma? Aye, Scot. When you're Carney's age, you'll be ready to fight. Until then, you practice being a good boy, then a good man. And that's what being a good soldier is, knowing you're fighting the good fight. What's the good fight? When you're old enough to know the answer to that, you'll be ready. Now in the meantime, why don't you take this knife and peel some potatoes for your mother? Put the knife down, Scot. He's not my dad. He doesn't tell me what to do in my own house. Scot. Let go. Scot. I'm sorry your father isn't here for you. I am sorry he died in my war. I'm sorry he isn't here to see you grow into a fine, young man. He'd be ever so proud of you. But if it's revenge you want, a life for a life, take mine. [inaudible] Scot, come and practice. All right, let's start with positioning. Nice to see you walking around. Aye. If our men had women like you, I think we'd have won our battle by now. And you've raised fine, young children. I've done my best. Here, let me look at your wound. Right. How did it happen? Three soldiers came after me. They wanted the reward. You were alone? Aye. But I thought the king would have some men with him. I sent them away. Why would you do that? No, that doesn't concern me. I truly believed that God had chosen me to be king, and then we lost. God didn't choose me, I did. And everything I did to honor him and everything I've done defiled Him instead. I had a dream that I was king. We were free. I thought it was real. Maybe it was a premonition. Your son Scot was in that dream with me. Open your cloak. Aye. I should leave here soon. You'll leave when you're well. Healing me is treason in these lands. You've given enough. [inaudible] my choice to heal you. We'll defend you the best we can. Aye, you're my king. I know I'm your servant, but until you're well, I'm your nurse. You're my patient. You'll do as I say. Aye. Can we visit you when you're back in your castle? I will return to my castle. Is it nice? I [inaudible] a castle. [inaudible] Aye. [inaudible] No one owns anything. This land was here for any of us and it'll be here long after. It doesn't belong to anyone really. Perhaps we belong to it. Perhaps. I'd like to live in a castle. I only want to say it's mine, though. King Robert, is this your sword? Where did you find that? My uncle gave it to me to fix. I return it to you. You're a blacksmith? I'm learning. It's a fine one. Keep it. It's yours. Let's give it back to your uncle. It's not right. It belongs to you, the king. It would be better to keep the peace with your uncle rather than risk your neck with me. You just [inaudible] for Scotland, for us. I'd do the same for you. You're a brave lad. Are you all right? You fear for Scot. Listen, I'll not take your son. There'll be no more wars. I'll not fight again. Oh, you will. If I could, Morag, I would just disappear here with you and the children, aye? Disappear, like a farmer, [inaudible].. No. Aye. No. No. You did those for wives. You did those for mothers. We need to know our men died for something. Keep your children. Keep them. My son has a destiny no mother's tears can change. Our faith has tired tears. You're coming with me. Do you know where it is? Watch it. What's here? What is it? Look inside. Is this the crown? I now pronounce you queen of the forests and the glens and the fairies, queen baliwigger. Now you're dead. Does that mean I'm king? Ooh. Very good. Scot's turn. It's his fault. [inaudible] when you're picking out, Ma. Ready? Aye. Aye. Steady. [inaudible] And what did I tell you? Spread your feet a bit more. Your elbow. [inaudible] Ma, look. I hit the target. Good for you, Scot. I found the Bruce. He's at your brother's croft. Sharp enough for you? Aye. And if the man we seek is alive, I'll cleave his head in two. I bet you will. All boys will kill their enemies and all their enemies are boys. What man is that? You should ask your boyfriend. His family gave him meat. On your way, lad. But say nothing, Briana. On your way, I said, and take [inaudible] scrapey with you. Fool. Fool. Sharpest sword in the world wasted on the dullest mind in the valley. Dad, that sword Carney brought you, the big one...
