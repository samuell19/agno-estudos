'It is said that a person can escape from his shadow... ...but not his past.' 'He can escape from his karma but not his fate.' 'He can escape from the unexpected... ...but not from the inevitable.' 'Neither you nor I can evade what is destined.' 'It's a different matter that to understand the cycle of life... ...I had to experience death.' 'Maybe you still don't believe it but I do believe it.' 'Yes, I believe in destiny.' 'Now look, I am miles away.' 'But hearing the tranquillity of this mansion, who can say... ...the things that will occur here today... ...could affect my life and my death, both.' Is somebody there? It's an incomplete game! Go and bring his luggage! - Yes! Greetings, sir! Ages ago, somebody defeated the King. But the King refused to accept his defeat. I am MK. This mansion's... - Owner! Not, owner! Call me the caretaker. Atar singh Jaiswal is the owner. He bought this mansion a few years ago. Now he lives royally in Kolkata. And I am looking after his estate. King said to write a letter to the... ...biggest architecture company in Delhi. I told Arthur and Manchanda to send you here. Did you face any problem during the journey, Mr. Mehta? Sir! Sir! Sir! No! I didn't face any problem! As such... this mansion is very grand. You have to demolish it and build a grand hotel. For the British people who pass this way. Mr. MK, I will build such a hotel that... ...the British people will have to pass by this way! Marvellous, sir! Your speech has laid the foundation of our hotel! I have heard that some other architect... ...had come here before me. He had come. But he was not as good as you. I will leave now. If you need anything then tell Balwant. Thank you! - Welcome! When would you like to begin your work? - Tonight. Who is it? Balwant! Balwant! After cleaning the mirror of my mind... ...with the pollen dust of holy Guru's Lotus feet. I profess the pure, untainted glory of Lord Raghuvar... ...which bestows the four-fold fruits of life. Fully aware of the deficiency of my intelligence... ...I concentrate my attention on Pavan Kumar. And humbly ask for strength, intelligence and... ...true knowledge to relieve me of all the blemishes causing pain. Victory to You, O Hanuman! Ocean of wisdom! Hail to you, O Kapisa! You illuminate all the three worlds with Your glory! You are the divine messenger of Lord Ram. The repository of immeasurable strength. Though known only as son of Pavan, born of Anjani. With limbs as sturdy as the mace. You are valiant and brave. Your physique is beautiful, golden coloured. And your dress is pretty. You wear earrings and have long curly hair. You carry in your hand a lightening bolt along with a victory flag. And you wear the sacred thread on your shoulder. As a descendent of Lord Shankar you are a comfort and pride of Lord Kesari. With the lustre of your vast sway you are propitiated all over the universe. You are the repository of learning virtuous and fully accomplished. You are always keen to carry out the behest of Lord Ram. You are an ardent listener, always so keen to listen to the narration... ...of Lord Ram's life stories. Your heart is filled with what Lord Ram stood for. You assumed the awesome form... ...and struck terror by setting Lanka on fire. With overwhelming might you destroyed the demons and... ...performed all tasks assigned to you by Lord Ram with great skill. You brought sanjivini and restored Lakshman back to life. Lord Raghuvir cheerfully embraced you with his heart full of joy. Lord Raghupati lustily extolled your excellence and said... ...you are as dear to me as my own brother Bharat. Thousands of living beings are chanting hymns of your glories... ...saying thus Lord Ram warmly hugged him. When prophets like sanka, even a sage like Lord Brahma... ...the great hermit Narad himself Goddess saraswati and Ahisha. Even Lord of death, Kuber and the demigods have been... ...vying with one another to offer homage to your glories. You rendered a great service to sugreev. You united him with Lord Ram. And he installed him on the Royal Throne. By heeding your advice, Vibhishan became the Lord of Lanka. This is known all over the universe. On your own, you latched upon the sun... ...which is at a fabulous distance of a thousands of miles... ...thinking it to be a sweet, luscious fruit. Carrying the Lord's signet ring in your mouth, there is hardly... ...any wonder that you easily leapt across the ocean. The burden of all difficult tasks of the world... ...becomes light with your kind grace. You are the sentry at the door of Lord Ram's divine abode. No one can enter it without your permission. All comforts of the world lie at your feet. The devotees enjoy all... ...divine pleasures and feel fearless under your benign protection. You alone are befitted to carry your own splendid valour. All the three worlds tremor at your thunderous call. All the ghosts, demons and evil forces keep away... ...with the sheer mention of your great name, O mighty Lord. All diseases, pain and sufferings disappear... ...on reciting regularly Lord Hanuman's holy name. Those who remember Lord Hanuman in thought words and... ...deeds with sincerity and faith are rescued from all crisis in life... All who hail, worship and have faith in Lord Ram... ...as the supreme Lord and king of penance. You make all their difficult tasks very easy. Whosoever comes to you for fulfilment of any desire... ...with faith and sincerity, will he alone secure... ...the imperishable fruit of human life. All through the four ages, your magnificent glory is acclaimed far and wide. Your fame is radiantly acclaimed all over the cosmos. You are saviour and the guardian angel... ...of saints and sages and you destroy all the demons. You are the angelic darling of Lord Ram. You can grant anyone... ...any yogic power out of the eight and also the nine jewels of wisdom. This boon has been conferred upon you by mother Janki. You possess the power of devotion to Lord Ram. In every rebirth, you will always remain... ...Lord Raghupati's most dedicated disciple. Through hymns sung in devotion to you one can find Lord Ram. If at the time of death, one enters the divine abode of Lord Ram... ...thereafter in all future births, he is born as the Lord's devotee. One need not entertain any other deity for propitiation... ...as devotion to Lord Hanuman alone can give all happiness. One is free from all the sufferings and... ...ill fated contingencies of rebirths in the world. The one who adores and remembers Lord Hanuman... Hail, hail, hail... Lord Hanuman, Lord of the senses. Let your victory over the evil be firm and final. Bless me in the capacity as my supreme guru. One who recites Chalisa one hundred times... ...becomes free from the bondage of life and death... ...and enjoys the highest bliss at last. All those who recite Hanuman Chalisa regularly are sure to be benedicted. such is the evidence of no less a witness as Lord Shankar. Tulsidas as a bonded slave of the Divine Master... ...stays perpetually at his feet, he prays... ...O Lord, you enshrine within my heart and soul. Oh! Conqueror of wind, destroyer of miseries... ...you are a symbol of auspiciousness. Along with Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita reside in my heart. Oh! King of Gods! 'Dear Lisa! ' 'My biggest mistake was to come here.' 'Nothing has changed here.' 'I had come to find a father's face.' 'But I met a turban.' 'A big turban to carry the burden... ...of my family and culture since ages.' 'Humans can be explained the language of love but not turbans.' 'To escape from the wolves, you shouldn't talk to them.' 'You should kill them.' 'I am coming this evening to take you away.' 'We won't get our parents' blessing.' 'But on reaching Bombay, we will take... ...God's blessing and get married.' 'Love, Arjun.' Catch him! - Brother! Arjun, come out! Brother, listen to me! - Get out! Brother, listen to me! - Get out! No, brother! - Arjun! Arjun! Leave Arjun! - Leave me, brother! Tie him up! - Brother, listen to me! Arjun! Please! Arjun! Don't harm Lisa! Leave her! Arjun! Arjun! Brother, don't do anything to Lisa! Arjun! Arjun! - Brother! Arjun! - Father! Please! Lisa! - Arjun! Leave me! Father! No! Arjun! - Father! Father, leave Lisa! Father! Arjun! Arjun, stop! Arjun, stop! Arjun! Wait! Arjun, wait! Arjun! For this derogatory woman, you raise your hands on your uncle. If somebody had behaved like this with my mother... ...in front of you then what would you have done? Shameless! You are comparing this cheap woman... ...with your mother! Father, you are comparing religion and love! I only want to marry the girl whom I love! Lower your voice, you shameless person! If somebody heard you then nobody from the next seven villages... ...will be ready to marry your sisters. Our honour, our respect, our position... ...everything will be tarnished! What is dearer to you? Your family's honour or your son's happiness? Not you, but this witch's magic is speaking. It's our mistake. The day we found out that her mother slept with a British man... ...we banished her from the village. But pitying the child she was carrying, we spared her mother. If that day itself we had beheaded that characterless woman... ...then today her filthy daughter... ...wouldn't have showed her true colours. Enough, father! You are humiliating my future wife! You are humiliating your culture! Have you forgotten that our religion, deeds, method of veneration... ...and even our Gods are different! The God from whom we had asked the boon of a son... ...you will dishonour that God! Will you enrage that God! Yes! If any religion, culture... God will try to snatch my love from me... ...then I don't want such God! The God whom I considered above everything... ...and whom I worshiped day and night since childhood... ...if today, He created hurdles in the path of my love... ...then I don't want such God! I don't want such a God who allows people... ...to kill somebody in God's name! Father, assume from today that one son of yours is dead for you! And for that God, one person is less who believe in Him. You love me a lot? I won't ever let you lose your smile. I am sorry. Because of my family all this... Forget it. Maybe it was God's will. Not God, Lisa. People. Today I have understood one thing very well, Lisa. There is no God. First, humans created God to escape from their fear. And then they used that God to scare others. But today seeing you so close to death... ...I understood the truth of life. Now I don't need any God. If you wish... you can believe in Him. I won't ever come in between you and your God. Promise me... you will always be with me. Yes. "Promise." "I promise you." "Promise." "I promise you." "Lifetimes of love." "Pain." "Our togetherness." "Promise." "I promise you." "Promise." "I promise you." "Lifetimes of love." "Pain." "Our togetherness." "Promise! Promise! Promise!" "Promise! Promise! Promise!" "Your dreams dwell in my eyes." "Your love dwells in my heart." "Your love flows in my veins." "Flows." "Now the tune of your love plays on my breath." "Promise." "I promise you." "Promise." "I promise you." "Lifetimes of love." "Pain." "Our togetherness." "Pain." "Our togetherness." "Pain." "Our togetherness." "Pain." "Our togetherness." Good that you came! Look! Will this royal blue go well with this wall? Do one thing. This royal blue... What are you doing? What happened? Come. sit. Respected Mr. Arjun singh. As we have discussed, in Palampur... ...Rai Bahadur Atar singh Jaiswal's mansion is being demolished... ...and a grand hotel is being built there. And Rai Bahadur has given this project to our company. so, in the committee meeting... ...your name was recommended. And accordingly your salary will be increased by 20%. Shyam Lal Sasodiya. Can you believe this? I will design that mansion the way I want. The interiors... the exteriors... I will build everything. I always wanted something like this. You know, Lisa. You are really lucky for me. Wow! Hang on! stop! Stop! Stop! Why does somebody want to do this? - What? Why does somebody want to demolish such a beautiful house? Lisa, why do you want to snatch my livelihood? Lisa, you have seen this. But not what I am seeing here. Just watch, Lisa. Such a grand hotel will be built here... ...that you will forget that there was once a home here. Let's go. Lisa! Hello! Lisa! As such, it's our custom to personally welcome the guest. But MK sir had some urgent work. That's why he couldn't come to the station. But he has asked for forgiveness. I have heard that the place from where you have come... ...there the season is the same all the twelve months. But it's not so in the mountain regions, sir. At times, it's sunny all the day. And at times, the sun is hidden behind the clouds. It gets quite chilly. But I have gathered enough woods in the room at the back. so you won't have to worry for two months. There is no electricity here? It will be installed soon. It will be installed in a year. It's been installed in the village square. So it will be here soon. This one. - What are you doing? I have tested all the keys. But this door does not open. You can try in the morning light. Maybe it will open then. Fine. Balwant! Serve dinner! - Okay! Who is it? Who is it? What are you doing here? There... upstairs... somebody is there. Somebody is there upstairs? - Yes! Who will come here so late in the night? Lisa, again you had a dream? No, Arjun. I really heard somebody's voice. As if somebody is in severe pain and... Lisa, this is a mountain region. Here, when the wind blows in the silence of the night... ...you hear strange voices. Now go to sleep. I too have to get up early in the morning and meet Mr. MK. Come on! I love you, Lisa! Don't miss me too much! I love you too! - Bye! Good morning, madam. - Good morning. Shall I ask you something, Balwant? - Yes. How long have you been working in this mansion? Since the time the talks of demolishing it have been going on. What do you mean? I mean master bought it to demolish it and build a hotel here. If he had not bought it, I wouldn't have got this job. And we wouldn't have come here. - That's true. Tell me something. Is there any other way to enter this mansion? No. Did you come to the mansion last night for some work? No. Why? Last night... last night, I... Balwant, have you ever felt something in the mansion? Have you ever felt that there is somebody else here besides us? Have you ever heard any voices? As if.. ..as if somebody is limping. As if... No, madam! I never heard any voice! So, did you like this place? - A lot! And more than that I liked the house. Which you have to demolish. I have written a letter to Mr. Rai in Kolkata... ...and I have informed him about your arrival. Now it's upon you when you want to start the work. I have mentally started the work. - Okay. But there is a small problem, Mr. MK. - What? I will have to take a tour of the house to make all the designs. But there is a backside door which is not opening. - so? I wanted your permission to break it. Great! You are asking me such a trivial matter! The entire house is yours. Break it. It's just a door. Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? I am telling you, this door was open. I have been inside. I have seen everything that's inside. There is a big wall with a big painting. There is a piano in front of it! I played the piano too. You... You know that I am telling the truth, isn't it? Lisa, who says that you are lying? It's an old door, Lisa. It might have opened yesterday. Today, it's not. There is no need to get worried about it. If everything would have been proper in this manor... ...then there wouldn't have been any need to break it. I agree, you must have gone inside. You must have seen the painting and played the piano too. I believe you, Lisa. You don't understand, Arjun. Since the day we have arrived here... ...something weird is happening with me. There is something in this house. There is something, that I cannot touch... ...but I can feel it. Sometimes I want to follow it. And sometimes I want to run away from it. You do understand what I am saying, isn't it? Lisa, come. Lisa, I know that since we have arrived here... ...you are not happy. Your body is here but your heart... seems like your heart is still in Mumbai. Lisa, this job is very important to me... But not more than you. If you wish then stay here a few more days. Or else, we will go back. You have gone mad! You are paid to do your job and not for giving advices! You know how much money Rai sir has spent on these people?! All I know is that their lives are in danger. You didn't listen to me earlier too. Because of your stubbornness... ...two people have already lost their lives. The house doesn't want to get demolished, sir. It won't spare them too. There's a soul, a power residing... - Shut up! I am not an ignorant person like you? I don't believe in all these things. If you don't then why do you live here... ...instead of living there? You know everything... ...you are pushing them towards their death intentionally! You live there too, isn't it? So, why didn't that soul trouble you till now? Because I don't want to demolish that house, sir. Listen for the last time, Balwant. That house will be demolished... ...and a hotel will be built on it. And if you dare open your mouth then remember... ...this is a small place and people are in search of work. Excuse me, father! - Yes! Father, the cross is a bit... Oh! There was a storm last night, it has happened because of that. The stairs are broken, I cannot do anything. When Simon and Peter come in the evening... ...they will fix it! - Sorry. I thought, maybe you didn't notice it, that's why... No, that's perfectly alright my dear. I never saw you before! - Yes, we have just arrived. You know Mr. Rai's manor... - Yes. My husband is going to demolish it... ...and build a hotel there. Oh, I see. What's your name, my dear? Lisa singh Rathod. Lisa singh... and Rathod. That's very interesting. So, will you come alone for the Sunday mass... ...or will you bring your husband along? What happened, my child? When I opened my eyes in the hospital... ...everything had changed. Arjun had left everything. His house, his parents, everything. Even his God, whom Arjun worshipped since childhood! For the first time, I saw love and hatred... ...together, in Arjun's eyes. At that time, I couldn't explain Arjun anything. That's why I explained it to myself. I don't know if we did something good or bad? I don't know if God has forgiven us or not?! Greetings madam. - Greetings! Greetings madam. - Greetings! Lisa, you were right. There is a painting and a piano. But, not the door that was troubling you. See, I take such good care of you. This door was troubling you, so I broke this door down! Now, if this house troubles you... ...then I will demolish this house too. Thank God, there is a smile on your face. I had told you, if you go out, you will feel better. Felt nice, isn't it? Lisa, since I have arrived, I don't like anything too. You know why? Because since we have arrived... You haven't embraced me properly even once. 'That day, when I embraced her... ...I didn't know she was standing miles away from me.' I embraced her but I couldn't feel the silence inside her. I wish, I could have understood her. Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Gayatri! Gayatri! Gayatri! Gayatri! Gayatri! Initially, I thought it is all an illusion. But after the last night, I am sure that there is someone in that house. Last night, I heard him, I saw him! He was standing right in front of me, father. I am very scared! I am really scared! Did you tell Arjun about all this? - No, father. If he doesn't believe me then I will feel bad. And if he believes it, then he will feel bad. He will leave everything. And return to Mumbai with me. After he met me, he has lost in life. For the first time, after coming here he is happy. I don't want to snatch his happiness... ...his career from him! I understand. Then you don't have any other option but to stay there. That's why I have come to you. Can you please help me, father? Stay here. Good boy. Good morning, Lisa! Good morning, father. Father, Arjun has gone out for just two hours. Fine, you wait here. What happened, father? Lisa, old manors are like old people. They witness everything for years, silently. Something good, something bad, something very bad. The people that commit the bad deeds leave... ...but their images remain in their eyes! Maybe these eyes have seen something too. Endured something. But now, you don't have to worry about anything. Because now I have blessed this house, my dear. Now you and your husband can peacefully stay here. Thank you, father. My pleasure. Who is it? This is a Latin phrase. And it means 'your death my life! ' The soul is threatening us. Seems like there is an old enmity... ...between this soul and that girl. And it doesn't want anyone to interfere between them. Madam Lisa is not at home, father. She went to Delhi along with sir. When will she return? - In 1-11/2 weeks. Look, listen carefully to what I say. As soon as your madam returns, ask her to come and meet me. I want to tell her something about this house. If they spend even one more night in this house... ...without meeting me... Then their lives could be in danger! Understood! Yes! Why have we stopped here? Just a minute. Yes! You cannot go ahead? - Why? The English soldiers and the Indian revolutionary people... ...are having a scuffle. It can be dangerous for you. Madam, you didn't go? No! There was some problem on the way... ...that's why sir had to go alone. Balwant, I will have my food in my room. Madam! After you left, that... What happened, Balwant? Did someone come asking for me? No... I had doused the stove. That's why it will take sometime to cook the food. No problem. Mr. Devender, there is no need to do all this. You don't worry, you will get the cement and iron contract. Sir, this is not about business, it's about being a good host. Of course, Mr. Arjun! And if you come to Delhi and don't see Bichua's dance... ...then the heart-filled Delhi will get angry. "When the scorpion stings you!" "When the poison spreads in your body!" "It makes you squirm!" "Be careful!" "When the scorpion stings you!" "When the poison spreads in your body!" "It makes you squirm!" "Be careful!" "It makes you lose your senses!" "It intoxicates you." "Whoever casts an eye on her, tries to hold her hands..." "He is dead for sure." "When the scorpion stings you!" "When the poison spreads in your body!" "It makes you squirm!" "Be careful!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!" "Since... I have grown young!" "It has brought zest along with it." "There is a joy all over." "My condition is not sane." "My body is ablaze." "There is intoxication in me." "When the scorpion stings you!" "When the poison spreads in your body!" "It makes you squirm!" "Be careful!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! "Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! "Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! "Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! "There are millions... after me." "All the fools... are crazy after me." "All the insane people present here..." "All the false lovers." "All of them don't know!" "My style is killer." "When the scorpion stings you!" "When the poison spreads in your body!" "It makes you squirm!" "Be careful!" "It makes you lose your senses!" "It intoxicates you." "Whoever casts an eye on her, tries to hold her hands..." "He is dead for sure." "When the scorpion stings you!" "When the poison spreads in your body!" "It makes you squirm!" "Be careful!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved! Beloved!" Gayatri! Gayatri! Sir, this is the state since the past two days. She neither eats nor drinks. The whole day she lies on the bed. Why didn't you call a doctor? I did call him. Yesterday evening, he came to check on her. If you say, I will call him again. Go quickly. - Okay. Mrs. Rathod! Mrs. Rathod! Fever is quite high. After the examination, I think it is influenza. But I will have to check for other infection. I will wait till tomorrow morning. Otherwise she will have to be admitted to a hospital. You were saying she didn't eat anything since the past two days. Yes. That's not good. Make her eat something under any circumstances. Otherwise the infection could increase. Bye! - Thank you! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Balwant! Father! In the church! Come with me, Father! There! Mr. Arjun! - Yes! Who are you? I am an ordinary man of God. Today, I saw an unusual thing in the church. God is bleeding for one of His children. I don't understand. But I understand the language of God. He wants to save His child. And that child is in this house. Lisa. Can I meet Lisa? Lisa? - Yes! Lisa! You don't know but I have met Lisa! I know she is not well. I want to help her. May I? You shouldn't listen to him. Your wife needs medical attention. We should take Lisa to the hospital as soon as possible. I need just five minutes. Five minutes! I want to meet Lisa just once! Lisa! Lisa, my child! Can you hear me? Lisa! God, Almighty! I had explained to you! I had come to your house and told you! I had told you not to interfere! - Lisa! I had told you! - Lisa! I had told you! - Lisa! I had told you! - Lisa, no! Lisa! Leave him! Leave him! Lisa, leave him! I had told you! I had explained to you! I had explained to you in your language! I had explained to you in your language! Why did you come? Why did you come here? Tell me! Why did you come? - Lisa! Leave! Leave! Get lost! Leave! Because she is possessed! There is a devil in her body! Look, I am not against medical science! But right now she needs God and not a doctor. Look, father. I respect you. You can perform any veneration you want. I won't interfere. But let me do my work. I too am not interfering in somebody's work. I am trying to save that child's life. Her life is in danger. According to my experience... Your experience is limited to your church. Come out and see life once. On one hand, you have people like Sigmund Freud... ...who is working on personality disorder at the Vienna university. And on the other hand, people like you have a narrow viewpoint! In the case of personality disorder, a person has a split personality. And the same is happening with Lisa. Yes! But why does she talk in two voices? And one voice is the voice of the devil. Because a person has two vocal cords. One is primary and the other, secondary. He uses just one. But because of personality disorder, Lisa's body... A devil has entered Lisa's body. Because, as soon as I placed the Cross on her forehead... She had fits! - Yes. Because she has high fever. During that high fever, if instead of a Cross... ...you had placed a wet iron rod... ...still she would have behaved in the same way. Why don't you people try to understand me? Pardon me, father! Mr. Arjun, she is your wife. You have to decide. The ambulance is waiting outside. If you don't take her to the hospital now then I can't help you. Please, father! Leave us alone! Come. Good we brought her here. Her temperature has gone down. I think she will be normal by tomorrow morning. It means, I can take her home by tomorrow evening. Provided that the priest doesn't come there again. Okay! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! What's happening to you? Lisa! Doctor! Nurse! O my God! Hold her! Hold her! Hold her hand tightly! Hold her hand! Get an injection. - Yes, doctor! Carefully! Carefully! Hold her! Hold her! What are you doing? Carefully! Hang on! Hang on! Enough! Enough! Nurse, quick! What are you doing, Kallu? Shocked? Shocked to hear your childhood name? Forget yours, I know your entire family's name. Your father Ramnath used to work as a gardener in the big garden. Your mother Kaushalya used to work... ...as a maid at Totadmal's mansion. Your grandfather Harkisandas... ...used to clean British man's horse dung. And once he was caught in bed with British man's daughter. British sir tied him to the horse... ...and made him take seven rounds of the mansion. You are his blood relation. So what if you were not caught? You too did the same thing with your master's daughter. Under the pretext of a check-up, you brought her here and then... ...here on this bed you injected her to make her unconscious... ...and then for three times... Doctor! Do you know what's wrong with Lisa? Do you think you will be able to treat her? "I love you." "And that too immensely." "I love you." "And that too immensely." "As long as I am alive, I will wait only for you." "I love you." "And that too immensely." "People adept at using words don't understand... ...the language of the heart." "People consider loyalty as a crime." "If this is a crime then I will commit this crime again and again." "As long as I am alive, I will wait only for you." "I love you." "And that too immensely." "I love you." "And that too immensely." "As long as I am alive, I will wait only for you." "I love you." "And that too immensely." 'My fight was with God.' 'But what was Lisa's fault? ' 'lf instead of her, something had happened to me... ...then would she have prayed to God for me? ' 'Maybe yes.' 'Lisa might have pretended not to believe in Him... ...just to please me.' 'But I knew that in some corner of her heart... ...she still believed in God.' 'lf she had been in my place then... ...she would have never thrown Father Thomas out of the house.' 'I knew that I won't ever beg in front of my God.' 'But how can I snatch this right from Lisa? ' 'Before coming here, I had promised her... ...that I will never come between her and her God.' 'And now time has come to fulfil that promise.' I am sorry, father. I misbehaved with you that day. Lisa needs your help. Will you... Whoever you are, I know you can hear me. What do you want? Why did you enter this child's body? The power of Christ commands you! Who are you? Our Father who art in heaven... ...haloed be thy name! Thy kingdom come! Thy will be done! - On earth... as in heaven! Give us this day, our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses. As we forgive those who trespass against us! Do not bring us to the test! Test! Test! Test! Test! Test! But deliver us from evil! Test! Test! Test! Who are you? Test! Test! Test! Test! Test! Four days! Just four days more! Then this body will be of no use to me! On the moonless night, this girl's spirit will leave this body. And I will take her with me. After four days! Lisa! O my... - Lisa! Poor child! - Lisa, wake up! Lisa! Father, what happened to Lisa? Lisa! My child! - Lisa! - Balwant! Sir! Sir! Sir, it's all because of me! I wish I had told you everything before! This spirit will not let this mansion be demolished, sir. It has already killed two people! It won't spare madam Lisa too! I had told MK sir, sir. But he silenced me with money! Sir, I kept quiet! I made a grave mistake, sir. God will never forgive me! I made a grave mistake, sir. If anything happens to Lisa, I won't spare you! Tell me what else do you know about this mansion? I will tell you! I will tell you! Mr. Rai bought this house two years ago. An old woman used to live here at that time. Maybe she will tell you. But where did she go leaving this house? Nayanagar. No. Nawanagar. 'Right now Lisa needs me.' 'And I need to know the truth to save her.' 'so for sometime, I handed her responsibility to father Thomas.' 'And I myself left for Nawanagar. Mister. - Yes. Where does mother Radha live? Mother Radha? Here. Mother Radha! I have come from Palampur. Can I talk to you? After two days is no moon night. If you don't help me, I won't be able to save my wife. You will have to tell me... that mansion's truth. What happened there? God writes destiny. But it feels as if God is upset. Satan has written Palampur's destiny. I didn't get you. Around 60-70 years ago... In the year 1857. Everything was changing rapidly. Gradually a voice was being raised in India... ...against the atrocities of British rulers. The voice of revolution. Gayatri's father Rai Bahadur Pratap singh... ...like other Indians, had forsaken his comfortable life... ...and he was busy in his fight for freedom. Rai sir left the responsibility of the house on my mother... ...and he went out with other men. As such my mother was a maid. But after Rai sir's wife's death, she raised Gayatri like a mother. At that time, only we three used to live in such a big mansion. My mother, sister Gayatri and me. He too is a rebellious soldier. Like your father, he too is fighting for freedom. Even after being shot his courage didn't wane. After being cured, he wants to return to his group. But till then he needs a place to hide. He wants... In this house, there is a place for every soldier... ...who wants to see India free. He can stay here as long as he wants, mother Kesar. Okay. Thanks. A message, mother Kesar! A message! Greetings! Mr. Rai Bahadur has sent a letter from Rakabgand. He will return after a few days. Gayatri, bad news. At Daulatpur, British people attacked... ...our sleeping soldiers and seized the tent. Once again our own man has deceived us. Our man passed the information to British people. And 90 soldiers died. They were the people of my tent. They were my friends. We won't win. Never. We will win. We will surely win. Who are you? Mother Kesar. Maybe a glass has broken? Yes, I was going to call mother Kesar. Mother Kesar is not here. I have brought her message for you. She had to suddenly go to the city. One of her relative has fallen ill. You were asleep. That's why she told me and left. But mother Kesar never leaves without informing... But I will tell what I want to say, before I leave. Yes! After two days, I will leave for Daulatpur. But after I leave, I will remember all of you... I will remember you a lot. Everything that you have done for me... I will never forget it! Never! Radha! What happened? Radha! Radha! Where are you going? Radha, stop! 'Soldier Mohan Kant.' 'Lieutenant Burton is very pleased with your work.' 'If you wouldn't have informed us in time... ' 'Then Daulatpur's revolutionaries... ...would have succeeded in their motives.' 'Burton sir has not only recommended your name... ...to the company for a reward but has also arranged... ...to send you far away from here.' 'But until the situation doesn't calm down... ...you will have to hide in Palampur.' 'One of his men will come to you when the time is right.' 'But until then no one should know... ...about your motives! ' 'Ram Singh, chief officer! ' We cannot go like this! If we leave, he will escape. What can we do? Not us, just me. I will stop him. You know uncle Bismil's manor, isn't it? Go and give this letter to him as soon as possible. And ask him to take to it to papa quickly. But what will you do sister? When a person stoops so low... ...that there is no way to reform him... ...then sometimes you have to stoop low yourself too. Go Radha! Go! "Come, come, come!" "Come, come, come!" "My heart burns like the lamp!" "My heart burns like the lamp!" "Now, I can't live alone, beloved." "My heart burns like the lamp!" "My heart is restless like a peacock!" "Like, there is a void and life is incomplete." "There is a fire of separation in my heart." "Let me drink from your lips now." "My cravings call out to you, listen beloved." "My heart burns like the lamp!" "Now, I can't live alone, beloved." "My heart burns..." "You are alone, I am alone." "The entire manor is solitary!" "This moment of restlessness is eager." "Soon it's going to be dawn." "Let's erase this distance together." "My heart burns like the lamp!" "Now, I can't live alone, beloved." "My heart burns like..." "Heart! Heart! Heart!" Catch him! You betray us! You have bound me in a bond, here! But where I am going... there won't be any bonds there. The soul will take the revenge of the body. My body will perish but the soul will stay here. Until... it doesn't take your soul along! After that day, Rai sir locked that room forever. And sent Gayatri to her grandma's house. The sacrifice that Gayatri gave for her country... ...she had to endure the punishment for it all her life. Because of the one night that she spent with a betrayer. She was forced to live alone. She didn't get anyone's love nor did anyone marry her! I stayed in that manor for 35-40 years! Then one day, I got this letter. It was written that, after suffering a long ailment... ...Gayatri Devi has passed away! 18 November, 1896! That was the day Lisa was born too. 'Why does anyone want to break such a beautiful house? ' 'There... there is someone upstairs! ' 'There is something in this house! ' 'There is something that I cannot touch... ...but I can feel it! ' 'Sometimes I want to go after it.' 'And sometimes, I want to run away from it.' 'You understand what I am saying? ' Lisa is no one else but Gayatri, son. She has taken birth again, and come to Palampur. And that wandering soul is soldier Mohan Kant! The soul has recognised the soul. The devil has changed destiny. We have only 24 hours! Tomorrow is the no moon night. The soul that has waited for 60 years to take revenge... There is only one way to stop it. What's that, father? Exorcism! What's that father? Using the power of the Lord... ...exorcising the devil out of the human's body. That's called exorcism. It's not that easy, father Thomas. You know that! For this, we will have to write a letter to the bishop! We will have to explain to him the entire situation. We will have to wait for his permission. But it will take nearly two weeks for his permission to arrive, father. We have only today. Whatever! We cannot perform the exorcism... ...without the Bishop's permission! It's not allowed. I do know about the rules, father. But if we don't save that girl then that will be a bigger sin! You don't understand, father Thomas. Performing exorcism is not our cup of tea. For facing the devil, we need unconquerable faith. You are going against our religion and our church... ...and taking this step, father! But, if something happens to that girl... ...then you will be responsible for her death. Right now, I am thinking only about her life. Before going inside, we will have to remember one thing. We are battling the devil, not Lisa. The devil is inside Lisa's body. He will try to fool us. He will try to deviate us. It's possible that Lisa might cry in front of us... ...beg, scream and shout! Try to weaken us. But we will have to be strong. And remember, that it's the devil. And not Lisa. We should tie her hands! Lord Jesus Christ, our saviour... ...have mercy on our souls! In the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. I cast you out, unclean spirit... ...along with every spectre from hell! And all your fallen companions... ...in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Be-gone and stay far from this creature of God! For it is He who commands you. He who flung you head long from the heights... ...of heaven into the depths of hell! Why then you stand and resist?! Knowing as you must, that Christ, the Lord... ...brings your pains to nothing. Fear Him! Fear Him! Lisa! Lisa! We will have to find her before dawn. If this moonless night ends... ...then everything will be over. You left your God because you were afraid of the snake. Your unbreakable faith has broken. Now.. Father. Father. Let it be, don't take it out. If this stays, the blood won't come out for a while. Don't worry about me, go and save Lisa. He will kill her. - But Father, you.. Nothing will happen to me. My God is with me. Give me my stole. But Father.. - Go, my son. Go, my son. Thank you, my son. Thank you. All the efforts already went in vain. Now.. Now, all your prayers went unheard too. I am taking my Gayatri along. How will you save your Lisa? With the power of my love. Lisa. Lisa. Save your Lisa. Save her. Lisa. Lisa. Did you see the power of your love? Your love is going away from you forever! Do you want to meet her for the last time? Do you want to meet? He will take me away, Arjun! Please save me! I don't want to leave you, Arjun! Save me! Do anything but please save me! Please Arjun, save me! I couldn't recognise you that day. That day, to save my love... I had a spat with God. It was neither the human's fault nor God's. It was the fault of devils like you, who had come... ...in the form of a human and snatched my love from me! Today, you are doing the same thing! But now I am not going to be deceived by you. Right now, if I want to get my love back... ...then I will have to mend the mistake I made that day. I won't let you snatch my Lisa from me. After cleaning the mirror of my mind... ...with the pollen dust of holy Guru's Lotus feet. I profess the pure, untainted glory of Lord Raghuvar... ...which bestows the four-fold fruits of life. Fully aware of the deficiency of my intelligence... ...I concentrate my attention on Pavan Kumar. And humbly ask for strength, intelligence and... ...true knowledge to relieve me of all blemishes causing pain. Victory to you, O Hanuman! Ocean of wisdom! Hail to you, O Kapisa! You illuminate all the three worlds with Your glory! You are the divine messenger of Lord Ram. The repository of immeasurable strength.

And he installed him on the Royal Throne. By heeding your advice, Vibhishan became the Lord of Lanka. This is known all over the universe. On your own, you latched upon the sun... ...which is at a fabulous distance of a thousands of miles... ...thinking it to be a sweet, luscious fruit. Carrying the Lord's signet ring in your mouth, there is hardly... ...any wonder that you easily leapt across the ocean. The burden of all difficult tasks of the world... ...becomes light with your kind grace. You are the sentry at the door of Lord Ram's divine abode. No one can enter it without your permission. All comforts of the world lie at your feet. The devotees enjoy all divine pleasures and feel fearless under your benign protection. You alone are befitted to carry your own splendid valour. All the three worlds' tremor at your thunderous call. All the ghosts, demons and evil forces keep away... ...with the sheer mention of your great name, O the mighty one.
