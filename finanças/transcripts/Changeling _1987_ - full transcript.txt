Changeling Screenplay: Jürgen Breest Director: Sohrab S. Saless Where is the toilet? - Over there! On the left side. Nice girl. He stuttered... if I wanted to be his wife. And what did you say? I said "Yes". I just wanted him. And then you got married. 6 weeks later. Why don’t you have any children? Soon, we will have one. So... was it nice? What about you?.... Did you make a decision? Yes. Very well! OK...see you next week. Good bye! Good bye Gabi! Bye Gabi, take care! Ill pick you up on Wednesday. Good bye! "Daddy" "Gabi" "Mummy" Good morning Mrs. Böscher. You owe me 70 cents more postage for this card. Here you are. Thanks. Bye! - Bye. So? What’s up? Don’t you both want to say hello? Hello Aunt Luise. - Hello my child. Did your mother write? Yes. She is at Elba again. I drank a bottle of beer too, today. To honor you, Gabi. Did you wait for us? Not really. I did not expect you to be earlier. We went to have some ice first. I paid for Gabi and her friends as a farewell. Nice. Was it hard for you to say Good bye? I don’t know. I guess Elke will be weeping tonight. That’s your friend? You don’t have to weep, OK? OK? We could meet Elke here and then. Both of you can write to another. You don’t have to be separate for all times. Maybe Elke can visit us during the vacations. There is so much room! May she sleep with me in my bed? Sure thing. Your bed is so big. What about... showing Gabi the house right now. There is something at your soles. I will clean it. Come to the kitchen, please! Just sit down... Please lift your foot. And the other one. Right, it’s OK. It’s so nice that you’re here. Böscher! Who? No. Wrong connection! Come on... Here’s the bathroom... This is Mummy and Daddy’s bedroom. I thought you don’t got children. Now you are our child. And we are your Mummy and Daddy. Don’t you like to call us Mummy and Daddy? How would you like to call us? But we ARE Mummy and Daddy to you from now on! My Mummy is Veronika. Would you rather call us Aunt and Uncle? I would like you to call us Mummy and Daddy. Agreed, Gabi? Well... it will work out somehow. What about "Bim, Bam, Boom?" Come on, Ill show you your room. Just go upstairs. Ill follow right away... Just keep going... The bed is solid. Thanks, Aunt Luise! Thanks a lot for all this. It’s a strange feeling now with a third person in the house. She’s good. You can count on that. Good morning. Come and sit down. Do you like milk or cocoa? - Cocoa. A bun with marmalade? - Just butter. Don’t you like marmalade? Would you like to go shopping later? I took a look on your clothes, they are mostly just garbage. After breakfast, we will buy some clothes for you, OK? Here you are. Did you get the same at the children´s home? With cheese. - Cheese that early in the morning? Because I don’t like marmalade. Why don’t you like it? - It’s so greasy. Would you like some cheese now? Thanks. At my home, these were called "nails of grief". Isn’t it much better if they are clean? Didn´t anybody care about that at the chidrens´s home? - Nope. How often did you get a bath? I guess 2 times a week, sometimes even more often. Most of all Andreas, because he got very dirty all the time. Do you like to bathe? - It’s OK. What about the swimming bath? - Oh yes, that’s fun! Do you like to go there? Not that much. Are you a good swimmer? Not at all. What a pity. It’s so nice to swim. You know... after the war nobody cared, and at we didn’t learn it at school. All houses are alike. - This is a settlement. How do the people identify their house, since all look alike? Because... there are street names and the houses have numbers. You are living at Mendelson Street 49a, right? You are living there too, now. The three of us. Who is Mendelson? He was a musician or composer. Hello! - Hello! All streets got their names from musicians here. It’s also called "The Musicians Settlement". Mrs. Berthold said it is fair if everybody got the same house. Yes, that’s fair. We have got now: 6 panties... and 6 vests. Moreover, I’d like 6 pairs of stockings and 6 handkerchiefs. Why always 6? I don’t need that much. Half a dozen is needed. - But why? Well, when I got my dowry, everything was counted per dozen or half a dozen. What is a dowry? Respectable parents give a dowry to their daughter when she marries, Clothing, furniture, kitchenware, linen and so on. And the boys? Don’t they get any Dow...Dow... Dowry? No! They will get a profession and will be earning the money later on. I want to earn money too, later on. We’ll take these two. OK Gabi? Well, I think that’s it now. Let’s think about it: we got shoes, pajamas, stockings, skirts, trousers... bathing suit, raincoat, and those sweaters. I’d like that one so much. That’s no good. - Please, Aunt Luise. It’s just 10 marks No. We already spent so much today. Let’s be rational. YOU spend a lot! - Yes, but for whom? I’d like that straw hat! Please be sensible, Gabi! All those clothes I bought for you and which you will wear one after the other. Surely, I bought some for stock, but all for a reason. There is no reason for a straw hat. When can you wear it? It just gets dusty. I would very it very often and besides I could hang it on my wall, it looks nice. Well that would be SOMETHING, a straw hat for a decoration! Come on, we have to buy food for diner and get back home. Please! Please, Aunt Luise! Come on! Let’s be rational! My God, it’s so hot! Would you like? Well, I really need some coffee now. Gabi, please help me carry all this. Over there. Come here. What can I do for you? I’d like a pot of coffee, please. What about you? A pot of chocolate, please. Hot... Maybe my Mummy will give me a straw hat at my birthday. Bon Appetite, little Miss. - Thank you. Did you go shopping with your Mummy? I am not her Mummy. She is a foster child. My real Mummy will bring me a straw hat at my birthday. Is that so! Do you like straw hats? When I was young, they were worn quite often. They were pleasant in the summertime. Lightweight and airy. Nowadays, they are rarely to be seen. At Karstadt (store), they only cost 10 marks. Is that so! You’d like one of those? Aunt Luise said it just gets dusty, but I could brush it off. Surely you could do that. Who is Aunt Luise? I see... You know... Straw hats... are really something beautiful. May I... donate it to her? No, you may not do that. It’s not about the 10 marks, it’s about... Please let me do it. It’s a pleasure to me and to her as well. I go out on the street and will be waiting there. Thank you. - All the best to you! Good bye. Such a charming child! She is from the children´s institution. Why don’t you sit at the table? You will catch a cold. Would you like a straw hat for your birthday from me? Well, it’s OK. (the puzzle is a picture of the 1000 mark banknote) I don’t want that my Gabi wears some cheap crap, do you understand? I will choose a nice hat unhurriedly. The most beautiful one, for your birthday, OK? This one fits! I want to try my new bathing suit. Will we go to the pool today Yes. Goody! Peace? Sure thing. Damned puzzle. One gets stupid by doing it. Come here. Ill show you something... How do you like this picture with flowers? That should be fun for you, it’s from Vienna. This ashtray is from Garmisch (Bavaria). Do you know where it is? At the Zugspitze. That’s the highest mountain in Germany. This jewellery case was bought for me by Uncle Hermann in Palma de Mallorca. That’s an isle in the Mediterranean Sea. We bought this sea picture at Norderney. We stayed at the painter’s studio, who is rather prominent on that isle. Sometimes when I stare at it for a long time, it looks like the waves are moving. This tin plate is from Uelzen. Can you understand what it means to me? All these things are telling stories to me, do you understand? I’m going outside for a while, OK? Well, OK. But stay in the settlement, there is too much traffic on the main street. And don’t forget: there will be dinner in one hour. I want to get in, please. It’s so hot. Am I late? It’s a quarter past 4. I didn’t have a watch, neither had the other ones. As it seemed to be half past 3, I came immediately. Do you think it’s friendly to keep me waiting this long? Look at you! Come in. Get washed in the bathroom and stay at your room. Good afternoon. Hello! Hi. What are you doing? Where is Gabi? In her room. So what? In her room! Anything happened? Well, she came late. Why? - For dinner! She was 90 minutes late. I see. Kids just got no feeling of time at all. So they have to learn about that. It’s enough! Her lips have turned blue already! Just 5 more minutes, please! She is still warm! Stop it! We’re coming! Can you just hold the towel ? I will put on your panties. - Why? You are a little too old for running around in the nude. But at the children´s home... You are not at there right now. Ouch! Your hair is wet, too. - Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Watch out! Everything gets dirty. - Ouch! Why being that petulant? OUCH! Ouch. Well, I got some headache. Very nice. Put it on. - Everything? Not the underwear, of course. - Everything else? Yes. Why not? Here! Luise, it’s not necessary to show everything. I can see that you did a good job. I want her to try on everything. - I think it’s stupid. Pardon? Sorry, Aunt Luise. I just wanted to say... - I think it’s better for you to go to bed. But I want to watch TV some more with Uncle Herrmann. - It’s past 9 already! Don’t be that strict, Luise. It’s the vacations! Well then. But just half an hour. Thank you, Aunt Luise. Stay with us. (TV programm with singer Udo Jürgens from Germany) If only I had bought that straw hat. Well... Just buy it. Buy it! Good Night! Aunt Luise... I’m going out. Child... You’ve been outside the whole morning. The weather is so fine. Why don’t you stay with me a little? We could talk. Or... You could draw a picture. Come over... Ill show you how to fix buttons. But I’d like to go outside. Well then... This is my new friend Susanne! And what do you like? May I show her my room? We’d like to play there. No. Not today. But why? I... It would be too much. All that noise and dirt... We’ll be silent. We’ll take off our shoes as well. Please, Aunt Luise! No. Rather not today. I am allowed to enter Susanne’s home. That’s nice, but... - My Mum likes it when kids are at home. Well, it’s not possible today, and now I got work to do. What about just showing her my room? We will be out right away. I would love to show her my room. Please, Aunt Luise. Maybe some other time. - Ill tell it to Uncle Hermann later on! That’s mean! Maybe she will let us enter some other time. No never! So we will enter secretly, when she is not at home. - Hm, come on... What did you do down in the cellar? I... The matches... The matches, are located on the refrigerator. Strange... Yesterday I just saw a whole pack of them. Maybe the kids... - The kids? Meaning Gabi? Nonsense. She would never take anything without asking. Are you sure? - You know about her. And if she secretly, behind my back... - Gabi is an honest girl. TV: it’s a highly sensitive rocket, which can be armed with an atomic head... A supersonic jet will take her into orbit, sensors for heat will show her the way. At the trial run, this will be a redundant US satellite. Security supervisor McFarlain justified the decision to expand the anti-satellite project by stating that the US just want to draw even with Russia. According to McFarlain, Russia has for a long time... Did you mean I am lying? I don’t understand. You say that Gabi doesn’t take matches. Gabi is honest. But they disappeared, so I must have taken them and lying to you! These silly matches, why do we need them at all? Maybe I put them away to avoid that Gabi would do something stupid. That’s even better. Obviously, you don’t get the gist. - Nope. OK, it doesn’t matter. It would be really bad if you’d think of me not being honest. (TV news are going on...) OK! This smells delicious. Bon Appetite! Uncle Hermann! I’ve got a new friend named Susanne, may I play with her in my room? Yes, of course. Because Aunt Luise... - Yes? I didn’t allow Gabi to bring the girl here. I see. Just eat, or it will get cold. Do you think this way to treat me is friendly in any way? I’m disappointed anyhow. We can talk about anything, but such a conspiracy... You are exaggerating now, Luise. - Maybe! Nonetheless, I’m really sad. I’m sick. May I go to bed? - Of course. Good night, my child! You are being just too unimpressive, my child! I’m not asleep, Hermann. Did I wake you? No. I heard everything. What did you do at her room? When I came upstairs, she was crying. So I entered to see what’s going on. What’s up? She is unhappy. What did you want there? I just told you. She was crying. Because of me? Yeah, the quarrel. Quarrel? I did not quarrel with her. She is just very sensitive. Taking everything seriously. So you are meeting secretly. While I´m asleep... Good Night. My night won’t be good, I guess. My God, Luise. She’s just an innocent child. I think she doesn’t like me. Nonsense. She says that she would like to be fond of you. She said it? She want to be fond of me? You just know that. I would be so glad if I could be certain about this. Have you been sleeping? - I don’t know. Or can’t you sleep? I’m sorry that we quarreled? Will we be friends again? And what about Susanne? We’ll talk about that some other time, OK? Good Night! - Night. I was told that Gabi is just an average pupil. But now these grades. That’s no surprise. Gabi has to deal with a lot of things at the moment. A new class...new family situation, different learning techniques, I think it’s just too much for the child. Yes, it might be, but... but she is not missing anything. Fine. You can help her with psychological support. Praise her for the things she did right. Encourage her if she failed. Gabi is very sensitive and needs a lot of affection. Affection? Yes! Show her you believe in her. I’m doing everything that I am capable of. If so, she will soon have better results. I think we have to talk about your achievements at school. Yeah... We all want the best for you. Listen: I will give you a reward for good results from now on. For each A, you’ll get 2 marks, for each B 1 mark, and for each C, you’ll get 50 cents. For each D, you’ll get one day without TV and for each F, you’ll get a 1 day arrest at home in order to study what you have missed. That’s sensible, right? Where do go? Doing my homework. But you haven’t finished the meal. I don’t want it, I’m sick. What do you think about my offer? If Susi would help my with my homework, I might become better. Did Susanne tell you she will help? How are her grades at school? She is one of the best in my class. And where do you want to work? At her place. - Do you get tranquility at the place? It’s such a disorganized place. Maybe better here. What about... me helping you? You? Why not? I was not so bad at school. I could write fine essays. And maths? Ill learn that with you. It’s really difficult. Susanne is the only one who is good at it. The homework for tomorrow is quite a lot to do. I get it... you prefer working with Susanne. OK, Aunt Luise. If you want, Ill stay with you. OK... Get going. Bye! TV: some kind of German crime drama, maybe Edgar Wallace) Can’t you switch off the TV for once? - Why? Because I want to have a talk with you. We can just do that right away. - No, we can’t. What’s up? OK then. It’s not easy for me while you are pulling a frown like that. The film would have been finished in 10 minutes. OK, switch it on for that time. I don’t want anymore. If Gabi would be still awake, it would be easier for you to do without TV. What’s this all about? - Nothing? I’m worried about Gabi´s school grades. We already talked about it. We will see how your gratification system will work. I don’t like that she is working with Susanne that much. I’m loosing my control on her homework. Let her show you everything. It’s not just about that. Our contact is suffering by that. What about you doing maths with her. I would care for everything else. Me... doing maths? You where good at maths. It would be so nice. The 3 of us would join together... Coming home in the evening, I am supposed to do homework with her? Or just at the weekend. She will be too tired then. I just thought it would be some kind of fun to you. After working the whole day long... Yes. It’s OK. Hello! Hello! What’s up? Will Gabi come outside? Gabi is on arrest at home. Really? Once again? As you know, she got a F again. Shall I bring a message? I’m looking after her anyhow. Gabi! That’s not possible... Gabi! - Yes. What’s happening in here? You call this arrest at home? Give it back, give it back! - Where did you get my husband’s pic? He gave it to me! - I don’t believe it! Ouch! Get to bed! I don’t want to see you before supper time. Evening! You are here! I have to start preparing supper now. Where’s Gabi? She’s got home arrest and stays in bed. What did you do to her again? - What do you mean: do to her again? Just ask Gabi what SHE had done. She kicked me. Moreover, she stole a pic of you. A pic of myself? I gave her on of my passport pics. You gave it to her? Why didn’t I know about that? Why didn’t you tell it to me? Is it that important? Oh yes. It is to me. Did you ever think about if she ever wanted a pic of me? But you just can calm down. She doesn’t want it. Oh well, Luise. I want you to talk to Gabi later on. While being on arrest, she build a cave in our junk room. Moreover, she kicked me. Why? - Because of the pics. What pics? From you... from her mother, and Susanne. I have ripped them. You shouldn’t have done that. There are other kinds of punishment. Are YOU gonna tell me about how to educate children? Luise... it could be so nice if you... I know that you want the best, but... Why don’t you just show her your affection? How should I show her? Just like that! I can’t do it. I can’t do it! I don’t know how to do it. Please stay, don’t leave me alone! I’m afraid of the child! Luise, what’s this about? Yes, just go to her! It’s sufficient when you show Gabi all the time that you like her! (Song from the radio: Herbert Grönemeier: Männer [Men], very popular in those days) Oh no... Take a look at this... I forgot the whipped cream. No problem. You are just human. Hello! Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! It’s so nice being able to visit you at last. Such nice flowers, Ill put them in a vase right now. Please come in... Gabi, will you please guide your mother to the living room? Coffee is ready! Please! - Thanks. Please, serve yourself! - Oh no, you shouldn’t have done that. You made such a big effort. A slice for me, too. Can’t you serve yourself, Gabi? Some sugar? - No thanks. You’ve got such a nice home. You’ve got such a good life here. The house got 110 square meters of living space. Is that so? Do you plan to live on the outskirts later on, too? Maybe. When my husband and I will have some kids. My God, this fine tablecloth... Can’t you just watch out, Gabi? Sorry, Aunt Luise! It doesn’t matter. May I smoke? Of course. Thanks. I know it’s not healthy, but I can’t stop it. I got used to it after Gabi was born. I’d like to smoke a cigarette yet again. Please, help yourself! I’m just a little worried about gabi´s grades at school. I wasn’t good at school neither. She is one of the last ones. - Oh yeah? My mother always told me: why should you get good grades, you are pretty and you can use your hands. Your husband won’t ask for your school reports later on. Today, it’s important for girls to graduate and have a good chance to get a good job. Gabi told me that she wants to earn her own money later on. Right, Gabi? - So you have to exert yourself. I do that, but it doesn’t work! - What doesn’t work? I can’t get it into my head, otherwise, I do forget everything. Then I do it all wrong and I am scared. My head is always just vacant or just plentiful. I just don’t know... If we write a test, I’m always scared. And then...then... - What about then? I make a mess in my pants sometimes. But why... Nobody is doing you any harm. are the teachers scolding you? Nothing bad can happen to you, You got a home now, and people who will help you. You just have to ask if you don’t know about something. Will we take a walk now? Don’t you want to show me your room at first? Ill show it to you, come here... Ill stay with Uncle Hermann. Like another cacao? No thanks, Uncle Hermann. Who is that girl? Susanne, a friend of Gabi. Nice... Everything is so nice. You can’t imagine how grateful I am to you. Our only concern is that Gabi is feeling happy. It’s so rare that people are concerned about others. The main thing is that you are a little luckier now than before. After all you’ve been through... You know, I really get so sad when I see the child. Do you understand why my husband doesn’t want Gabi to live with us? Surely, he wants children of his own, but... Gabi is kind, indeed. He says she is always remembering him about that terrible matter back then, so he could not stand living with me. Do you understand? In a way, yes. It’s hard, but also comprehensible. It’s very kind of you to say that. My bad conscience pesters me so often. But now I’m a little calmed down. We will be good friends, right? - Yes, of course. You are good. So, lets go... Please walk without me, I don’t feel so well and want to rest. Ill stay here too, then. But it would be s nice... Maybe it’s even better if you are alone with the child. So this is the kind of woman that men like to rape. What will you do now? TV? My God, Hermann, what did happen to us? Do you want to sleep with me? What’s wrong? It doesn’t work. Why not? They could return any moment. All you are thinking of is this brat! I’m leaving... Ill leave so you’ll have the whole house, you and this kid and her fat mother... Where do you want to go? - Don’t touch me or I will scream! Just be rational, Luise! Do you want to rape me? Why are you talking such nonsense? You’re so rotten! Poster: My wild Joys (Train station announcements) Bildzeitung please! (popular German tabloid) What can I do for you? - A beer, please. Yes. Do you like to eat as well? Yes, I want to eat. Ill fetch the card... - Do you got Wiener Schnitzel? Of course! - Ill take that. Our Wiener Schnitzel is very good! (TV: soccer report) Hermann, that was so terrible. It’s OK now. Is she still awake? She wanted to wait until you’re back, but... however, she did fall asleep. She did wait for me. I am such a beast... These are the problems that have to be solved. Everybody got them. I am often so afraid I could... you could... You don’t have to be afraid. If the 3 of us stick together... Nothing could do us any harm. Do you think we will handle this? Yes, of course. This is just great! What... what is great? You just know it, Luise my girl. All this... the weather, the landscape, we being together... I’d like to have a real boat like this one. It must be nice to swim on the water like this. It IS nice. Why not? You could try it. If you like, we’ll go to the airport some day to take a sightseeing flight. I always wanted to do that. - Oh yeah! His name is Hermann. Just like you. But I never took a sword. What did he do up there? - Chasing away the Romans. Back then, 2000 years ago. What are Romans?- They were the ancestors of the Italians. They occupied this country, you know. - Occupied? They pretended that they would own this country. But it belongs to the Goths. What are Goths? They were our ancestors. Me too? - We hope so... Isn’t it beautiful? It’s like laying on a cloud, looking down. Why do we need this? It’s much nicer sitting on the ground while eating. What about ants? - There are no ants. A smell of mushrooms, right? Pooh, they are toxic! No way! Most of them are eatable and taste good. Look: how nice! Autumn is coming. Does it taste good? My grandmother did bake tons of this. Rudi and Olga did eat such much of it, I had to hide in a shelf with my part of it, in order to get anything at all. Like some more? Go away! Go away! No!... No... Gabi! Hermann! Gabi! Hermann! Hermann! HERMANN! HERMANN! Here, I picked them for you. You were asleep so nicely, so... we wanted... I was not able to wake you up. We put the boat on the water and... mushrooms... I was looking for mushrooms. Good bye, Mrs. Böscher! Arriving on the 12th of Oct... in Osnabrück... at 15hrs at the main station. Will Hermann pick me up? Everything will work out fine if you keep quiet and nothing is laying around the house. And don’t tell Granny about school. If she asks, just tell her you are enjoying being there. Do you know what you will tell her if she should ask you... if you love me? And what will you tell her? Yes. Yes what? That I love you. Just put the flowers into the water. Which class are you in now? - Third. Do you like going to school? - Yes. You got such lovely hair. Do you got it from your mother? - Maybe. I don’t know my Daddy. - Yes, of course. You don’t know him. Did you got any grandparents? My mother’s parents are dead and my Daddy’s... - Yes, I know. Would you like having a Granny? - Yes. So just call me Granny, OK? Ouch! What’s the matter? I just cut my finger. Do you love your mother? Yes. Luise will get her birthday present tomorrow. But you will get your present from me right away. Thanks. Thanks! Thank you so much! We just became friends. Don’t you want to show your mother the gift I had for you? She calls me Aunt. Ah yes. Well, show it your Aunt then. That’s That’s... That’s impossible, Mother! Why not? I got it from my grandmother, and she is my first granddaughter and shall have it now. She is NOT your granddaughter. Yes, it’s a little too wide, we have to make it tighter. Aunt Luise, I’m so glad! I love you Granny! Did you call her Granny? - Yes. Oh my, I forgot about the cookies. They are in the kitchen, Gabi, put them in a bowl and bring it here. Why cookies? There will be dinner, soon. Gabi, please get those cookies! Don’t bother her! - Gabi! Luise! Please! WHY DON’T YOU DO AS I TOLD? I didn’t hear it. - YOU’RE LYING! I TOLD IT 3 TIMES LOUD AND CLEAR. EVERYBODY CAN TESTIFY! Sorry, Aunt Luise. It’s just the ring. it’s like a dream. So go to the kitchen and get the cookies. - Yes, Aunt Luise. No, thanks. You know... Trudi and Olga graduated at High School. It wasn’t that easy in those times. But now... it pays off. Luise was the only one to fail. Mother, you do know that... - What? If you would have had more confidence in me, if you would have expected more of me... Oh! Do you really think? If only you’d said a word. All of you were always convinced that I was too stupid. Even though my grades... - Luise! What’s the use of it now? I would have succeeded, Mother. I swear, I would have succeeded. If only you had not discouraged me all the time. Good morning, my child! Morning. Come to me! Happy Birthday! Thank you, Mother. I shall own this? Father would approve it if he’d be still alive. I thought you gave it to Trudi or Olga a long time ago. No other guests? - No. Still no friends around here? I am very busy with the house and the child... But sometimes... you have to go somewhere else. Look here: the ring is twinkling. May I get another coffee? OUCH! Luise! That was your fault! You scalded her. You should have clinked to the pot! Do you mean I dropped the pot deliberately? Nonsense! Where are the bandages? - In the bathroom. Come, lay down. Keep your head backwards. The nose is bleeding. Show it. Granny gave it to me. You begged for it, right? You like her that much? No! I will keep it for you. Dear Uncle Hermann, I am very sad as I’m writing this letter, I am not able to stay here anymore, even though I love you very much. I have to get back to the children´s home, because I am not able to love Aunt Luise, nor is she able to love me. Aunt Luise doesn’t like children. I will miss you very much, I will always remember you and Granny. I’m writing this because I am not able to tell it, and I am scared of Aunt Luise. Please take me back to the children´s home. Yours truly, Gabi. I just found this today. You will forget about this letter. It is impossible for you to leave. We OWN you! Whether you like it or not. You will tear up the letter now. Tear it up... TEAR IT UP! Tear up... Please tear it up... My God. You are alive? You are alive. You are alive. You are alive. Gabi? You can’t go outside like this. You can’t leave me alone now. Gabi! What shall I do? What shall I do? TV: soccer game... subs musiclova 11/2017
