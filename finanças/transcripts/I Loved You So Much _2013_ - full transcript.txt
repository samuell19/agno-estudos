Come on! What was I saying, brother... You know H?seyin, my cousin, he told me... The auctions are done. The coastal highway construction is beginning soon. Everything will be great, Cemal. I don't see the point of this coastal road, Sadik... We spoke with Arif Usta about it the other day. He says there won't be any fish or anything around here any more... Never mind Arif Usta... Let him sit in his little shop day and night... This Russian thing will be over in a few years. This road, it will get between us and the sea, right? You really think the sea will let that happen? This is the Black Sea. Look, wise up. Think of Songul. Think of your family. Don't be stubborn. Let's get together, and become partners. Selling a few leather jackets won't get you anywhere. There! Shoot it! What is it? You lost your aim? You made me miss it! You have no idea what else you're missing... Welcome, Cemal! Good to see you! Have you got anything? The grouses were away from me today. And Sadik kept firing away; both with his gun and his mouth... Here they are. What happened? Nothing; it's Sadik as usual. He's been talking nonsense, trying to pull my leg... Dad! My beautiful daughter! Give me a kiss! Come on, let's go in. Come on, go inside. So, what does Sadik want from you? He's been talking back and forth... I think they're not getting along well with your sister these days either. My sister is right to complain. Never mind her now. Sadik sent these quails for Songul. Cook them for her; the girl has fallen weak.. She needs to eat lots of quails to be as strong as you are. Stop! I'm busy! My beautiful Ayse! We need to hurry up. You even didn't put any make up. What were you doing in the washroom for so long? We are so far from home... Everything is good. Boss has sent us a car. Welcome, sister. Thank you. Is Murat not here? He's waiting for you at the hotel, sister. This is Trabzon... Remember everything I said to you. For example, that here they say "yes", but their "yes" doesn't mean our Russian "yes". They just put it as a completion. Don't stay in town for too long, son. And come here more often. Dad! My doll's arm is broken! Can you fix it? How are you, sister? Fine. How is my sister doing? She's fine. There you go. Let me kiss you. Come on! Have a good day at work, Cemal. Take care, and don't you neglect us... Right... Don't you worry, Ayse. See you... Goodbye. Cemal... You know Murat, the owner of this hotel... He invited us to have some fun at night. We'll go, won't we, brother? That man Murat is getting on my nerves. I heard he says he's from Istanbul... Who the hell is left here from Istanbul? And nobody likes the scumbag, but his place is full like a public bus every night. The man owns the Natasa enterprise... Right... A very esteemed man indeed... I don't have much business with him. I just took care of a few little problems for him, and he returns the favor. How else would he let me test drive Natasas for the first time? Look, Sadik... The woman you're cheating on is my wife's sister. If you were going to get tired of her so early, why did you marry her? The Russian women weren't around then! Watch your words! Don't despise the girls of Trabzon, or you'll get slapped in the face! Wait a bit, I will be back soon. Okay. Goodbye, sister! Tea... It's on us, don't worry... Have some! Thank you. Oh, you speak Turkish, then... I've practiced it a bit. Good for you. Goodbye! You're doing your friend a favor. Come on, give it to me. Let me tell her if you like... - No. I'll tell her. - Fine... Olga, let's go up to the room, at least to wash hands, then we will walk and talk. Halil? What's happened? Nothing. Let's go? Have a nice day... Welcome, usta... You were going to put the new goods on display? And did you sweep the floor? You're sitting drinking tea like a boss? I didn't mean to, usta... It's time to work hard. Money doesn't grow on trees. The goods have just arrived. I was about to place them. Come on, get to work, then! I will, usta. Have a good day at work, Ahmet. Good day, usta. Welcome, Cemal. Pour some tea for us. I will, usta. How are you? Are you alright? You seem to be worried. Sadik got me uptight early in the morning. What's that guy saying this time? He's obsessed with the Natasas. That's all he talks about. He's unhappy at home, Cemal... A man unhappy at home goes through tough times... Listen to him, be his companion, but... Don't you do what he does. He keeps insisting that I come with him... He'll make me fall into the sin too. You'll be fine... To this day, I've never seen you do wrong. In spite of Sadik... I don't care if a woman is the most beautiful in the world; If she's to sleep with me for my money, I don't need that kind of woman... Sergey, Disappeared again. Nina... I have to start working as soon as possible. That's what I actually was going to talk about. You know, you need time to a find good job in Trabzon... And that school, you were going to work, has been closed. Then I need to find another school. Yes, we can try, But it is not that easy. Sure, there is work, you can earn fast and a lot, but.. For example? All those girls, who are coming here... Anytime they have money problems, any trouble they come across, All of them... At least one time... You understand what I mean, Right? What? What? Olechka, This is the only way to earn money here... No... I am trying to help you now. And you've been talking about that job? No... You know, I had the same attitude as you towards all that when I first time came here But look at me now; I have money, and nothing happened. I didn't lose anything. At the beginning I was also planning to find a good job. I learnt Turkish, I taught English to children, I worked getting half of what Turkish people earn, Because I am a foreigner here. And it doesn't matter how many diplomas you have or, You are very intelligent you are a foreigner. But if you're a beautiful woman, you can earn much more then all of them Because all Turkish men are mother fuckers, and we are something new for them, And they are ready to pay.. Give me my passport right away. My boss took your passport. What? Olya, you need money right now, and Murat knows your situation. And he can help you to earn good money. You are fresh, you are beautiful. He is amazed just with your photos. Wait... Don't worry, it's going to be ready today. You've earned enough for today! How are you, you KAurd? Hey, Sehmuz, any beautiful women coming to the shop lately? Yes, so what? Sadik, enough! Leave Sehmuz alone. I'll get him married to a girl from Trabzon! You act like you adopted this boy, just because you promised his father! Look! Mehdi, my friend from the army, entrusted him to me! Cemal, come on, we're going. Sehmuz can close the shop. You're coming with me. No, brother. I'm tired. I can't go up to the plateau either. I'll watch TV at home and go to sleep. Boy, I'm telling you, you and I will make a movie; And look what you're saying: watch TV and go to sleep... No, I'm not coming. You can go! So, here's what we do... You owe me 750 dollars, remember? If you come with me, I'll waive your debt. Why? I feel like it! Are you not my brother-in-law? Come on! I'm telling you: I'll take you to heaven! Heaven! Wait... Please, calm down. Let's suppose that you are right, but your mother is ill, Your sister needs money and you know perfectly well who Sergey is. 100$ per hour or probably 150. I need my passport back. Do you think it is all that easy? I will go to the police! Olya... Olya! You don't understand who you are dealing with... Nina! Welcome to Trabzon, Olga There's been a misunderstanding. I came here to work... But not like this! I want my passport back. You want your passport back... Did she tell you about the money at all? What money? What money... Olga... You seem to speak a bit of Turkish, right? How come? Have you been around here before? No... You'll be our visitor here for a while, Olga. You'll have to. Untill you pay back what you owe me. What? What do I owe you? Good evening... Sadik... You're early, brother. We've seen a photo of Miss Olga, and now, here she is, then! I don't want this! Will you force me? Sadik, you wait inside, brother. We'll have a little talk with the ladies. You are so beautiful. Sadik. I don't want it! Something is wrong here! Sorry... Wait a moment... You wait at the bar, and I'll be back with her. No! Yelena, I said no! Give me back my passport, or I'll call the police! Go ahead and call them! Call them! Stop it! The girl isn't willing, don't you see? Don't get into things you don't know about. Who the hell is this? What's up with you, crowing like a rooster in front of me? I'm the rooster of this poultry, boy. So I'll bring this poultry down on you then... You're in Trabzon! Get your act together. If the woman doesn't want it, that's how it is! Take it easy... This woman is trembling in fear, brother... Have you no conscience? Come on... Whose property do you think you're taking away? Shut up! This woman is not staying here tonight! Murat! Don't make things inextricable! Get in. Cemal! What do you think you're doing! You madman... That's not the way to handle this! Murat brought this girl for me! Fine, Sadik, let's not talk too much and break each other's hearts. What's with you? You haven't drunk a single glass yet... Nothing! The girl says she doesn't want it. Are you going to force her? Why do you care? Why is it your business? Don't drive me crazy We're here... You can come out. Cemal? Usta... Alright... Alright, come inside... What's going on, Cemal? We have a sojourner tonight. Well... I thought you wouldn't get into this sort of business? It's not like you think, Arif Usta. That inglorious man Murat attempted to sell this girl to Sadik... The girl was unwilling. Don't ask about the rest. And you protected her. Is that so? Arif Usta. You teach me to protect the one whom refuge to you... I... I am not a Natasa... And... Natasha is a beautiful name... But you people use it to mean "prostitute" What is your name? Olga... Olga Guriyeva I'm Cemal. And this is Arif Usta. You'll stay here tonight, alright? I need the police! He didn't give me my passport! And my suitcase is at the hotel! Don't talk about the police now, wait a while! You, come over here for a moment. Did anybody follow you on your way? No... Cemal... You took a woman out of Murat's hotel... You've brought trouble upon yourself! I don't care about Murat! Boy, will you never change? Will you remain crazy all your life? Don't you worry. You're a bit anxious, I see... But don't worry. As long as I'm here, they can't touch either of you. Come over here. Come here, dear. Take off your jacket. Don't be afraid. Relax! Have some. It will help you calm down. Thanks. And this is your room. You'll be comfortable here. You can use these as you like, dear. Thank you. Come on, let's prepare your bed too. Good night. Cemal... Just a moment... "Hero". Don't say that... You can lock the door if you like. No... Good night. Cemal, what are you doing? What if Ayse hears about this? Good morning. Come on, have some. - Is the girl asleep? - I think she is. What will you do? I'll ask for the girl's passport back. Look. This man Murat is a dangerous one. Sober up. He can't do anything to me... Don't you worry... I was like you when I was young, so brave... But you have a wife and a child. Don't get too involved with this man. So what should I do? Go to the police. Actually, let's go together. Arif Usta, do you think this guy doesn't have contacts at the police station? And which statesman was it who said, "Honorable men in this country have to be as courageous as the dishonorable ones"? Right. You're right, but... Times have changed. Don't let the girl out today. Advise her to stay in. I'm leaving now. Sadik, look, you're one of the rare men I like around here... But let's set matters of friendship apart from business... It's not my problem. Find this guy Cemal, wherever he is, and bring him to me. Brother... You have a visitor. Wait. He's come himself Yes, he's here I'll call you later. So, what do we do now? I have nothing to do with you. Everyone has his own occupation in this life... And it seems you've picked up pimping as yours! This girl hasn't come to Trabzon for this kind of work. She is unwilling. When a woman says "no", a man has to stop. That's our custom here. Most of them don't come here saying "I want to be a whore"... The first time they do it crying, Second time they cry a bit more, And in the third you see them counting their bucks in their little bags. Because they provide for their families in Russia with that money. It's give-and-take. So don't play the heroic man just because a hot girl took guard behind you. I guess you don't understand me. The girl says she's not a Natasa! She took refuge with me. Let's give her passport back, and let her do whatever she wants. It's not my business, and it's not yours... Alright... here's what we do then, Cemal... You pay me for what the girl has cost me, and I'll give you the passport. What cost? The girl didn't come here swimming, did she? She came on a ship across the Black Sea. And I paid her friend to bring her here too. And I had booked the girl for some people. I took some of their money upfront. I've booked her a room in this hotel. What a disgusting man you are... You've set up such a scheme here... We work all day to sell a few leather jackets, And you're making money out of thin air here! Ten thousand. Dollars. What are you talking about! How will this girl pay that money! I don't care, brother. That's her problem. There's 500 dollars here... We'll talk about the rest later. You have two weeks. Are you threatening me? I'm going to drive you out of this town! Get your act together! Get your act together! What happened to your face? Nothing. We had a quarrel about Olga. Bastards! You're only strong enough for women, aren't you... Bring Olga's suitcase. I'm waiting. Where is she? Is she alright? Yes. Come on, bring it. Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Do you speak Russian? I know a little... Well.. and how? I will tell you soon. Thank you very much, for opening up your home for me. It's been a bad beginning for you... But don't worry. You're safe here. But, you've got be careful. Welcome, usta. Brother Sadik has been asking about you... Alright, I know. There he is. Where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere since morning... I couldn't call Ayse either... hat have you told the man? Sehmuz... You go out and take a long walk now... Cemal... Where is the girl? The girl is no prostitute, Sadik. I've made a deal with Murat. We'll pay her expenses and he'll let her go. Is that so... And who will pay for the expenses? I'll pay five thousand dollars, and you'll pay the same. Here's five thousand dollars for you! Boy, have we lost our minds? Why should we pay money to some unknown woman for nothing? Sadik... You've slept with dozens of Russian woman coming to Trabzon... You've cheated on your wife many times. To hell with whoever has given you your name! You're into all sorts of schemes, at home, at work... Have a single good deed to your name! Why do my deeds concern you? Ah, I because you're fond of her, right? Why don't you say it straight! Are you keeping her in your apartment? Go away... I don't want anything from you... Just get the hell out of my store! What's going on? I said go away! He must have found a long time Natasa... Damn these women! Like there are no men left in their country. They're getting settled in Trabzon. And like there are no women here Fadime! Do the man have no fault in this? You're right. But you know how men are Ayse... First they'll see a woman, next thing they'll fancy her. I'd gouge the eyes out of such a man, and kill him! Right... You can't understand it unless it happens to you. What is it? What happened to you? Nothing... Tell me, come on... I found a bottle of perfume in Salih's pocket yesterday... And? So what? The kind of perfume that men in the city put on themselves... So? That's the way things started with Halime's husband too. The guys want to smell good to Russian women. As if we didn't deserve the same! Alright... Look at me... Don't cry. If my Salih is flirting with Natasas that would kill me Ayse... Don't say that! Are you crazy? If he is to be with a Natasa, let the Natasa look after his babies too then! Let her come and work here in the fields, wash his dirty laundry... And Salih is like my Cemal. He wouldn't do such things. He wouldn't, would he? Of course he wouldn't... Don't worry about the perfume; maybe he wanted to smell nice to you? Our men love us Fadime. And if the Natasas have the tits, do we not? Come on, don't worry about such things. Good to see you. - My suitcase... - I'll take it. Thanks... Thank you very much. I was cooking. Would you like to eat with us? Fine. What are those, Cemal? I've done some shopping for you, usta... You shouldn't have bothered, Cemal... So she's cooking? I've just arrived. Poor girl; she's cooking up the few things she has found in the kitchen... She was at home all day... Good, she should stay in. What about the passport? Arif Usta... The guy wants money. I thought so. And my business isn't going so good these days. Who among us is doing good in business, Cemal? We work for our daily bread... You should ask Sadik to deal with it... He knows Murat too, so... Forget about Sadik, Usta. All Sadik can think of is sex... So... What will you do? I don't know Usta... We'll find a way. What can this girl do here? I don't want people to know either... If Ayse hears about this... I can't explain it to her. Here you are. He will give my passport? He will... He will but, it's going to be a bit difficult... Cemal, Do you think I can find a job? I want to work. You don't have your passport. So he doesn't give back the passport? Lena, Why did you do this to me... What is she saying? She's talking about someone named Yelena. She seems to have done her wrong... You say so, but it's her who gave me your suitcase. I need to go, Arif Usta... Let us eat our meal, you can go later... I should go home... I'll drop by again... What brings you here at this time, Cemal? I missed you, that's it... Can a man not miss his wife? Alright, stop, come in. Let me pour you some tea... Is Songul asleep? Yes, she's in her room. Forgive me, God! Are you very tired? It's not that I'm tired, but... Sadness brings one down. What is it? Fadime... I think her husband has gotten himself a mistress... A Natasa... I don't think so... Salih isn't a man to do that... Have you seen him? Talked to him recently? No. I haven't seen him for a few weeks. Is this the stuff you women talk about all day? You, come here for a moment... My Cemal, you are the one... What is this? My father. He was a tailor. This is me. I was a teacher of literature. I retired when my father died, and took over his business. How did you learn to speak Russian? Before the revolution of 1917, my father went to Russia to work... There he fell in love with a Russian girl. After the revolution, my father had to come here, and she was left there... But he was always in love. That's so sad... Look, do you recognize him? No.. Cemal! Cemal? Cemal is a good boy. He is a bit mad... But he is courageous. That was an opera building. It was converted to a cinema, and then... They pulled it down. Pulled it down? Why? For a road to be made, for trucks to drive on, they say, but that's wrong. It's due to the clash between two prominent politicians. The beautiful opera building came to be the victim of their spite... It has to be somewhere around here... Yes! My father's record. Come on in! You went to the plateau on Friday? I... had some work to do. I brought you laz pastry. Come in, have a seat. I'm trying to put together the money. I'm thinking of selling the car, but then how would I go up to the plateau? I might sell Ayse's favorite cow KAinali as a last resort... She's gotten rather old anyway. Come here for a second... Do you know what that cow means for Ayse? Get a grip on yourself! Don't you do something crazy! And... You've been coming here very often these days. Get it out of your mind! You don't even know Olga properly. Let her tell you about her life in Ukraine; About what she did there, whom she left behind when she came here. But... You tell her about your life here too. Tell her about Ayse, Songul, Sadik. Here you are! Thank you. I told you: laz pastry, it's sweet. It's not like yours. It's my third day here. I've been idling around. I came here to work. Cemal... How shall we get my passport back? Murat wants money. I'll sell these. They're not worth much, Olga. I'll owe you the rest. I'll work and earn money, and pay back. I can't go back to Ukraine; I need money. Give it to me. Very good This used to belong to my wife. Thank you. - It looks great on you. - How am I looking? Very good You don't look like a Natasa at all like this. Let's not say Natasa! Natasa is for us what Ayse is for you. Thank you. Trabzon is a very beautiful city. It is. Arif Usta says it used to be even more so. Can you tell me about your country? About your life there... Yalta, Ukraine. It's very beautiful, but hard to live in. I have an old mother. Chernobyl gave her cancer. You know Chernobyl? Of course I do. It mucked up Trabzon's tea and nuts! Where is your father? I don't have a father. He's gone away when I was three. And... I have a husband, Sergey. We've been married for five years. But he's been homeless and drunk for the last three... So, life in Ukraine is very hard now. I thought, maybe I could make some money here. Everyone goes to Trabzon, and comes back with money. I know that some of them did prostitution, but there were people who worked in proper jobs. How could I have known that Yelena would set me up? You know, those bottles you brought, that go into each other... What do Russians find interesting about those? Wait... Look... Inside every woman, there are many different colors. Brother, let me take a picture! Take it You look great together! Get away You keep it. What have you done today? We sold the matroskas, and a few other goods. They didn't pay much. We need to go looking for a job for her. I've found one! Really? Yes! Halil Usta runs a jewelry store on the street next to mine. I heard he needs a female salesperson who speaks Russian... Can you do it? Until I find another job... We still need money. We have less than half of what we need. I can't get it together without selling Ayse's cow. We can't leave this unfinished. What's that, Cemal? This? It doesn't look good? You'd never wear a hat. You'd say it disturbed you. Well, I don't know... I felt it looked good on me, so I bought it. Where is Songul? She's inside. How are things at the shop, Cemal? Not very good. Nobody pays their debts, so I can't get new goods to sell. I've had the same variety for a long time. It's a small shop after all. If there's so little business, why are you in town for so long? I'm working. Money isn't made easily. I stay late, so I can't come up here. How are things in the apartment? Do you have all you need? I do, don't worry. Ayse, I'm thinking of something... What, Cemal? I'm thinking of... Selling one of our cows... What are you up to this time, Mr. Sadik? What could I be up to? Look, what are you doing here at this hour? We'll go shopping with Ayse. I came to get some money. What's happening? Why are you meeting Ayse? What do you mean? Do I need your permission to meet her? No, but... I was asking if something is going on... Something is always going on with you, Sadik. Do you think everyone is like yourself? You think I'm the only bad man, but that's not how things are. Tell that to your sister. You're all the same. God damn you all! Let him do whatever he wants. As long as he provides for his family, I don't care what else he does. Sister... Yes? Sadik and Cemal want to be partners. Do you know what sort of partnership this is? I think they're already like partners. What do you mean? They go hunting together, eat and drink together Do everything together. That's what I mean. Sister, you meant something else, but you're not saying it now, right? Look, I like Sadik... but my Cemal loyal to his homeand and his family. Isn't that your neighbor Fadime? She's turned blonde too. Perhaps her husband has a Natasa too. But... this is unfair! Unfair? It's the common fate of us all... My Cemal wouldn't do such things! Oh, right, he wouldn't! Olga! I'll get your passport back. Leave Cemal. I'll look after you. What are you saying? Sadik! Mind your own business! Arif Usta! Welcome! We bought fish. Let's eat together. Here. That looks like the houses in Santa? Take a look. Why do you want to go there? And who is this man? My grandfather. He used to be a stonemason. He was from Santa. He went to Yalta to earn a living. And he met my grandmother there, And fell in love with her and got married. And he never come back again. I want to go Santa. But, Santa is so far and it's hard to go there. Fine. We'll go there. My grandfather... He was here! He walked and ran around this land... With a bit of luck we could've been relatives! Does anyone live in my grandfather's house? Can I go in? No. The house is locked down. But let me see if I can open the door. It's open! My grandfather has written this! What does it say? Goodbye, Santa.. Something like that... There used to be a school over there. Shall we take a look? Where? Over there... Olga! That's our plateau over there. See? Come over here. Olga, Watch your step! Come here. Olga! You go upstairs. I'll go to the grocer's. Here's nine thousand dollars. So? Give me the passport today. Everyone knows me in this town. My words are words of honour. I'll bring you the rest tomorrow. What happened? You fell in love with the girl? You folks are such emotional men, really. You know, Sadik does the best... He never sleeps with a Natasa twice! He knows that if he sleeps with the same one twice, he'll fall in love. Stop the drivel... Don't test my patience... Will you give me the passport or not? I'll give you the passport when you bring ten thousand. Now, take that nine, and come back once you've made it ten. Come on. You're looking for trouble. Cemal! How is Olga? I haven't seen her in a while. I know she's upset with me. I'm very sorry. Can you give this to her for me? I'm so sorry. Please give that money to her. Her family needs it a lot. Tell her to go back to Yalta. And may she forgive me. Please. Don't blame yourself. This will make her very happy. And she'll forgive you. Arif Usta! Olga! Cemal... We were carrying the crops over that stone bridge one day, remember? With the load on my back, I slipped, and you held me just as I was about to fall down. I thought, "He will never leave me." I wish... I wish you hadn't held me that day, I wish I fell in the river and drowned in the fierce waves, not to see this day! You left me unable to breathe, Cemal. Shame on you! Cemal... How are we going to solve this now? Even Sadik was more honest than you! Yelena sent this. Tell her to take the money too, and go back. AA AA I am sorrowful and mourning AA Whatever you say, I will be fooled A AAA A I have notlaughed once in tis wr A AA I am cg and brning up A AAA A I have notlaughed once in tis wr A AA I am cg and brning up I told him everything about my life! I wish you had told me at least. Then I would've held myself back. Cemal said he'd tell you himself. He promised me. Everything has gone haywire now... How are you, sister? Who are you? What do you want? I've brought her some news. Brother Murat is calling her. It's about Yelena. What happened to her? She isn't doing well. You need to come with me. Who do you think you're fooling! Come on, get off! I swear, Yelena isn't doing well! What happened to Yelena? She's having a fit, sister. We couldn't figure out what's happened to her! You're her closest friend. Brother Murat said you should come and take a look. I swear, I'll bring drop you right here afterwards. You'll bring me back here; promise! I will, sister. Olga! I'll tell you something! Listen to me! Listen to me! Open that window! My beautiful daughter! My princess! Dad! My dear... Why are you here, Cemal? Your darling will be worried! You're right in whatever you say. You shouldn't have done this to me! But I'm not just going to dye my hair blonde and shut up! Ayse... Don't speak, Cemal. I've carried mountains on my shoulders, and I haven't complained once. I worked for hours, days, in hunger, without a regret. My heart has beaten for you Cemal. In the winter, I waited for you alone here for days... I looked after your mother, your father... But I never worried about myself, but about you, I'd wonder what you were doing, I'd worry that you might be cold, or hungry... These thoughts kept me from sleeping, do you know that? Did you fancy that blonde woman so much? What did she do for you? What trouble did she take for you? All I want is that you tell me this. Will you? When have you last spoken to your family? Why is that your business? Call them. Come on, it's on me. Come on, sit down and call your mother. Mum, It's me, Olga... Mum... Sergey... I'm very sorry. I spoke to Yelena last night. It's her who got the news? I'm saddened to hear it. Where is Yelena? She went back to Yalta for a few days, last night. I'm sorry to have lied to you. You wouldn't have come here otherwise. My mother is ill. They couldn't even find money for Sergey's funeral. What have I done... You are not to blame, Olga. You tried your best... But life is hard everywhere. You can't get by just working in a jewelry store or tailor's shop. You can't find a teaching job here either... Maybe things will get a bit better once the road is done, but... Sadik has his mind set on you. He told me where you were. He asked me to persuade you. And I know you have your passport. Yelena told me. There's a ferry leaving tomorrow. You can get on it and leave, if you like. But obviously, You need money. And I'm telling you, you can find money. You can rob this guy for as much as you want, Until he's tired of you. And then you can return to your country, with your money in your pocket. You give me that passport now. If you lose it, it's all over for you. And you're registered in this hotel as a client. Go to your room now. I'd bought a few pieces for you, and Yelena has left some too. Pick some. And you must be tired. Take a bath, have some sleep. Come on. The other girls will help you. Cemal? Yes, father. You look worried, son. You're here, but your mind seems to be wandering. Yes, father. It's as if now I'm in a deep well, Next thing I'm in the middle of a stormy sea, And then I'm inside a big fire. I don't know how I'll get out of this trouble. I see my own youth in you. But even the ignorant me didn't make as many mistakes as you did. Ayse told me everything. We're trying to get used to being without you. But we can't do without Ayse. She is our daughter. She did so much for us. What you did is inhuman... Right... Because I don't have a heart, I don't have feelings... Like my eyes and heart can't do no wrong by accident. I did something bad, but don't keep dwelling on it. And Ayse wouldn't leave me anyway. What are you talking about, son? She's a very proud, honest girl. She does what she says. What will she do? Cemal! There's a call for you. Sadik... You've been my friend for... how many years? Tell me now. Get out of here! It's you who set us at odds for a Natasa. You were my brother! Is it me who set us at odds? So, you don't love your wife, fine Are there no other women to be with around here? Why is that your business? I'll be with Olga, and that's that! You can't be with Olga! I can be with any woman I wish! You can't! I love her! That bastard Murat will sell the girl. First to you, And then another man, and then another! What shall I do, Sadik? Here, shoot me! Shoot me, Sadik! Shoot me! You're my brother! How can I do you harm? I didn't know you were so taken with her... I've lost my bearings... I didn't know what to tell whom... Do you want anything? Do you want me to bring water or something? This necklace.. This is Yelena's necklace... So? Where is Yelena? Where have you found that necklace? She'd never take this necklace off. Tell me now, where is she? Yelena committed suicide last night... She threw herself into the sea... Liar! You whore! If it weren't for that fool Sadik, I'd have killed you right here! Who do you think you're calling a fool? Olga! Let her go! Stop, brother! Let's calm down... As we spoke! But this foolish friend of yours has fallen in love with the woman. And you know, he owes me ten thousand dollars, right? Are you here to pay that, brother? Sadik will give you the money we agreed on. Let the girl go. Here. How much is there here? Fifteen thousand. As we agreed. There's a couple of extra hundred dollar notes in it too. Now stop the drivel, and give us that passport. Cemal... You've had this woman for two weeks. We had a deal. You were going to pay me ten thousand dollars. With what you made this girl go through, it's you who owes her! Murat, don't make this any longer... I can make it as long as I want. Isn't the woman mine? Look, there's no need for any of this... Right. This whore made us go through all sorts of... Don't do this Cemal! If you call her a whore again, I'll shoot you! What? Either you people are idiots, or... you want to take my place! Sami, put the gun on the girl... I'll kill you! So you came here to screw me over? You have your eyes on my place, right? If you pull the trigger, do you think people will let you live here? Is it your money that you trust in, you pimp? All of this, for a Natasa, right... For this whore... Brother? Brother! Ambulance! Call ambulance! Sadik, what did you do... I killed the pimp. Cemal, take Olga, and get out of here. Come on! I entrust the folks at home to you, brother. Olga! Let us know when you've arrived safely. I wish you the best. Don't worry about me. I'll never forget you. I... It's not your fault, Olga... If it was a mistake, it's mine I loved you so... I, too, loved you so Cemal...
