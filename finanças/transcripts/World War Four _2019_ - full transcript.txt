(soft music) (dramatic music) Nuclear war, the subject of endless documentaries, spy thrillers, novels, films. Did any of us think for one moment that any of it could actually happen on our watch? During our time? If you'd asked me, I would have told you it was impossible. It would never happen. Ask any of the officers here. They all would have told you the same. Not surprisingly, it all started in Korea. (background voices on radio) No, if there's North Korean troops inside South Korea, that's an act of war. (radio chatter) Swick one, this is two four. I guess you've been monitoring, but we've got that movement again out there. Sir? Negative radar contact. We are in the worst possible position to get ambushed. (soldiers yelling) (gunfire) (unintelligible yelling) (dramatic music) My name is Sue, and I'm the wife of a soldier, and here's what I've learned so far about the start of nuclear wars. They begin with the little things. Like that raid in South Korea, and that other raid that followed. I remember that day. Which the U.S. Defense Department has called an unacceptable and irresponsible act, in response to the provocative act by North Korea, a U.S. Air Force, B-52 Stratofortress conducted a low-level flight in the vicinity of Osan airbase South Korea. (background News) Here in Cairo and across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, protestors threw rocks at police who responded with tear gas. The demonstrations occurred near the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy. But that has not stopped protestors from blaming the American government. Demonstrators shouted anti-U.S. slogans and demanded just- - So it's that time again. I've been seconded to the marines in the Middle East again. I can't tell you any more than that. I'll be fine, just like I always am. I love you. I love you too. I'll see you soon. Hey, where's your brother stationed at the moment? Aaron, uh, he's at some big exercise in Guam or Japan, or someplace. (speaking in foreign language) Go to the front! Hey! Go to the front! (speaking in foreign language) Two raids, one in the South Korea, one in the Baltic Sea. Both on the same day, both virtually an act of war. But you haven't heard the worst of it. That ship, the F101, was carrying NATO's full response if Russia decides to invade the Ukraine. So you think the Russians did it? Pretty much everyone does. But here's the thing, for each and every one of those attacks, we detected a massive spike in data and traffic, coming from an entity inside the U.S. Every time. Well, what do your superiors think? They think it was just coincidence, I mean, but, it's way too specific. It happened on two of these raids, and it happened on the raid with the oil shipments about three weeks ago. What would you like me to do about it? Mike, you're FBI. You can investigate the U.S. angle. I can't. I don't know what kind of influence you think I have Dave. Where would I start? We've narrowed down the source to a 40 mile radius, somewhere to the west of Washington D.C. I'm sending you some files now. Yeah, sure, send 'em through. I'll take a look. Let me know what you can do with it. Okay. Thanks man. I'm sure you can understand how important this might be. Okay. Dave, be careful. (eerie music) Is it possible for one man, or a group of men, to orchestrate a series of small incidents around the globe that could drag us into war? From B2 bomber flights over the Korean Peninsula to destroyers off the coast and missile batteries in Guam, US forces are showing they are ready to tackle anything that North Korea sends their way. Meanwhile, both North Korea and Russia continue to deny any involvement with last week's raids in South Korea or the Baltic Sea. The Pentagon's options include airpower to knock out North Korean missile installations, long range bombers that could take out its nuclear sites and government complexes, ships and truck-mounted batteries to destroy missiles before they hit their targets. North Korea's closest ally, China, opposes any unilateral military act in the area. North Korea has threatened to attack South Korea, the United States and other US allies. We'd become complacent, all of us, been living in a dream world. The threats that had been thrown around for so long most of us hardly noticed anymore, until it was too late. SC sub-com report. Sir, message from Stratcom. We've been ordered to the Korea strait. Stealth-mode-weapons-hot, over. Sub-come aye. Dive, dive. Make our dive depth 160 feet. Open outer hatch. So where are you exactly? I'm in an area about 75 miles west of Washington DC. So your buddies at the Pentagon come up with some lunatic theory that somehow links a US group to these military attacks and you don't think I'll notice when you disappear off on some wild goose chase for these guys? Someone needs to check it out Captain. I really think there could be something to it. The data's pretty compelling. I mean, every one of those attacks could have been carried out by 50 men or less. All of them push us closer and closer to war. Only if you're a conspiracy nutcase. How about this, how about the ISIS crazy man did it and the North Koreans did it and the Russians did it? You're saying that some entity in the US secretly planned these raids in order to slowly draw us into war? I mean, why would anybody do that? And how would they do it? Please Captain, just give me a little bit more time out here to check it out. Fife, I want a full accounting of every hour and every day you're spending on this, and I want it on my desk Monday. Is that understood? (dramatic music) Meanwhile, it is now 25 days since the terrorist attacks that set fire to hundreds of oil fields across the Middle East. And still they burn. None of the key terrorists have yet been caught, including their leader Hassan El Sherie. Experts say, unless the terrorists are stopped, large-scale war in the Middle East may be imminent. (phone ringing) Hello? Hi honey, I'm just checking in. I found a quiet spot where I can talk. I'm on a Satphone. It looks like I'm going to be pretty busy over here. Well, you be careful. Oh, you know me. So, what's new over there? I guess I haven't been away that long. Not much, it's pretty uneventful here. Sir! Okay, well I gotta go honey. I love you. I miss you. Bye. Oil prices skyrocketing, oil prices could reach historic highs if the unrest continues. (somber dramatic music) As you know, tonight's mission involves the kill or capture of at least two or maybe three of the USA's most wanted terrorists. Now these are the men most responsible for the attacks that halted the oil shipments. They are top priority targets and have threatened to attack again. Now we'll be landing in a hot LZ so expect a lot of heavy fire. Travel light, but really load up on ammo. Radio check. Dragon Zero One, Eagle five. Yeah, good morning, gentlemen, got a flight of two 46's up from Matsu. We copy. Good morning Dragon Zero One. Flight is two US Marine Corps helicopters. 1,500 feet, 10 miles to the east. Southwest turning. Mission to approach. Zero one in flight to the North. Ok men, take out your e-maps. Now, you know the terrain we're landing in. First, we need to make the treeline. Then, through the forest to the base on the other side. The mastermind of the attacks is unlikely to be there, but his leading men are almost certainly on that base. 147 Eagle request valve, looking for an LZ opportunity. Going to the north to Abib abama. Go! Go! Go! Go! Alpha teams on me. See the treeline to the north? Direct all your fire there. We're two men down already, sir. Dragonfly leader, this is Alpha team 1. We need CAS aimed at the treeline, 300 meters north of our position, over. Roger that, we're inbound now. I'm showing a very large contingent of enemy hostiles, extremely heavily armed, over. Dragonfly, you are cleared hot. Say again, you are cleared hot, over. Roger that. Use the helicopter as cover. Move forward. Down, down! Too many casualties. Gotta get out of the open. We're still under heavy fire, Dragonfly. Roger that. Coming back around. Dragonfly Two inbound. The helo's inbound. Use them as cover again. Go! Go! Down again men, down! It's getting worse, sir. They're cutting us to pieces. We've gotta make that treeline. Dragonfly, hit 'em with all you've got. Over. Roger. Coordinates 41-9-6 by 15-9-5, over. Roger that. That's done it. Into the trees, men. Go! Go! Go! We need medics to attend the killed and wounded, over. Ok roger, we're moving. Alpha teams, we're heading north about 1.5 clicks to the edge of the base. Maintain radio silence as long as possible, over. Got him. Alpha teams, we're going in. Stealth and silence. You know where the targets are. Move out. It's too quiet. Overwatch, you see anything? Negative, sir. Unit Two. Head west. Alpha One, I've got movement, 60 meters from your position. RPG, RPG! More inbound! Sir! Enemy's got at least four machine guns and RPGs in a position to dominate the whole complex. Roger, I heard that. We're already inbound, over. RPG! Sir! Troops on the ground are all too aware of the rising death toll which now- - Oil prices. There's unrest in Libya and other Middle East oil producing countries. Sir, are you okay? Roger that. Coming up to the complex now. Dragonfly leader. You gotta take out that tower. Danger close. Say again, danger close, over. Roger that. Enemy still intact. They're firing RPGs! That's no RPG. It's one of our aircraft. Urgent fire, Dragonfly. Urgent! Roger that. We're inbound now. Yes! Good shooting, Dragonfly. Targets are destroyed. Say again, targets are destroyed. Let's go. All units, the way is now clear. Time to get those terrorists we came here for. Capture if possible, kill if necessary. Go, go. Yeah go go go. (dramatic music) (gunshots banging) Go, go! Freeze now! We have Al Hazree. Say again, we have Al Hazree. HVI secure, break. We're showing a light truck full of armed hostiles fleeing the Northern sector. He's in a white van. North east corner. It's Nassar, over. We confirm. High priority target Abdul Nassar is fleeing the compound, over. Copy that. Clear to fire? NAB confirms target, clear to fire. Alright, firing. Target is destroyed. Say again, target is destroyed. All units, well done. Mission accomplished. Let's wrap it up. We lost a lot of good men tonight. Too many good men. Official state-run media broadcast the threat saying those who provoked North Korea once, will not be able to escape its unimaginable punishment. (phone ringing) Fife. Agent Fife. Who is this? Hello? Who- - Neeco. Gene, give me a quick trace on the number that just called my phone. One moment. Yeah, holding. That's a military number out of Syria, sir. Syria? Can you put me through? One moment. (phone ringing) Hello? This is special agent, Michael Fife, FBI. Did you just call this number? Call your number? You've reached a secure military line out of Syria. Why would I call you? Who am I speaking with, exactly? This is Lieutenant Caleb Jones, US Special Forces, and you have no right to call this line. And what are you doing in Syria? What I'm doing is classified. Listen, do you watch the news? You see those two oil terrorists taken down last night? That was you. That's why I'm here. Trying to stop those terrorists from causing a major war. That's all I can say right now. Well, I'm in the States, trying to do pretty much the same thing. I'm sorry. Obviously, someone's fooling with you. Yeah, but why would they want to connect me with you? Why you exactly? There's gotta be a reason. (phone ringing) Hello? Hi sweetheart. Hi Mom. So, did Caleb get away ok? Yeah. I'm not liking the look of the mess he's headed into. And I haven't been sleeping well. I'm not sleeping either but we have to be, try to be calm okay? What channel are you watching? Umm. The local news. Another thing on North Korea. Washington moved a naval strike force into the region. While Pyongyang warned it would retaliate against American aggression with nuclear weapons specifically targeting both South Korea and the US Mainland. A US aircraft carrier group will join the South Korean fleet in the Yellow Sea. North Korea warned- - I can't believe this is happening. Would bring the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. Satellite images showing Russian forces sitting along the Ukrainian border. Rioters smashed windows and broken into shops. Looted stores and fought with Police. Similar scenes have engulfed other major cities. USA! USA! Kiev has accused Russia of massive troop build-ups in the Donbass region. Tens of thousands of Russian troops on the Ukraine border. (dramatic music) (radio chatter) Command, you have a Russian Mig-23 headed your way. (sirens wailing) Strikers inbound. This is IS 5621, request taxi, single shooter. Three zero cleared for takeoff. Yes, all Aces right for takeoff. IS 99 is also cleared for takeoff. (military chatter) Eagles 4, this is Baltic Air Command. We have a Russian Mig-23 infringing allied airspace. Co-ordinates 3-5-9-9 by 21-0-5. Proceed to intercept, over. Copy that, Command. Cathie, I'm gonna report back. Aces gonna chase him on that. I'm gonna get Aces two-one out to the airspace. Copy. Aircom, we have target on radar. Closing to intercept. I see him! Break formation, Eagles 4. Unidentified Russian aircraft, you are trespassing over Ukrainian airspace. You are requested to alter course and clear this territory, over. Closing in for a better look. Back off Eagle 3. FoxFox! Foxfox times one. He's firing missiles. What's his target? Foxfox times two. Craig go out. What's his target? No target, he's firing them as a warning. It's like this guy wants to get shot down. Hailing Russian aircraft on all frequencies. Alter course or you will be fired upon, over. Baltic Command this is Eagle one. Requesting permission to fire, over. Eagle one, you are clear to fire. Say again, you are clear to fire. FoxFox! Birds away. Clean track. (explosion booms) Good mark, destroyed in half. Russian aircraft is destroyed. Say again, Russian aircraft is destroyed. (eerie music) (phone ringing) (speaking in foreign language) (phone ringing) Fife. Mike, it's Dave. Did you hear about the Russian plane? No. Our guys just shot it down over the Ukraine, I mean, the Russians are throwing a fit, they're threatening all kinds of things, but we got that spike again. I think we're going to be able to narrow your search area right down. So, what am I actually looking for? I don't know. Computer hubs in the middle of nowhere, I mean, coms towers, anything that looks out of place. Sounds unlikely, I guess. Yeah. Totally insane is the phrase my captain used. Now he's got me on a real short leash. Well, I'm grateful you're out there, man. Look, someone's gotta go check this stuff out. You just keep doing what you're doing. I'm sure something will turn up. Okay. Thanks, man. (phone ringing) Hello? Susan, I've just had a call from your brother. He's going to be part of the landing, part of the first wave ashore. In North Korea? What do you mean? They've halted the exercise and they're headed there now. The amphibious guys are going in first. Do you know what Aaron told me today? Something I've never heard him say before. What? He said that he doesn't think he's going to make it back this time. He says he thinks that this time is different and that his number's up. I've never heard him speak that way ever. This is happening in the vicinity of the force objective. We are considering it as dangerous. We are also considering it as hostile. Are you ready for this? Yeah. Yeah. How do you tell the winner of a nuclear war? Is it the one with the most missiles still left? The most planes in the air? The least cities turned to ashes? Is that how you tell? The USS George Washington arriving in Korean waters. The aircraft carrier is the centerpiece of this considerable show of force off South Korea's east coast and in its skies. (phone ringing) Hello? Hi honey. I'm just checking in again. There's a lot going on here, so I don't know how often we can talk. Are you okay? Caleb. Hey, have you heard about Aaron? Apparently, he's going in in the first wave. An amphibious landing in North Korea. A landing. I didn't know that. (dramatic music) How are you guys doing back there? Are you ready for some action? We're approaching our deployment zone. You better hold onto something. It's about to get rough. (gunfire banging) Whoa, that's a range finder. Woo hoo. (military chatter) Light 'em all up. We're headed inland. Caleb! You've got to get out of the city! Caleb. Listen, you've got to get out of the city immediately. Breaking News this hour. A mass landing of US marines in North Korea. The shooting war has finally begun as bombs rain down on the North-South border and the city of Seoul is completely evacuated. US sources claim that every nuclear weapon and facility in North Korea has been destroyed. While the Marines approach Pyeong Yang from the East, a giant fleet in the Yellow Sea is to attack North Korea from the West. Experts say it will be another 24 hours before that fleet actually enters North Korean waters. Meanwhile, the Mideast oil crisis has also taken a dramatic turn. Despite two of the leading terrorists being taken down by US forces, the Mastermind of the raids Hassan El Sherie, is threatening further attacks, as nations across the region prepare for war. To all concerned, 0310 (military chatter) A week ago, I could have been forgiven for thinking none of this would happen. But now, here we are. With 50 ships in the Yellow Sea and soldiers storming the beaches, and one of them's my brother, and my husband is who knows where. Gunner one-one to zero 995, over. 995 go for one-one. Cleared to engage, over? 95, one-one, you are clear to engage. 95 copy. I'll pass it to my higher, over. One-one copy. Centcom on the line for you, Lieutenant. Lieutenant Jones. Lieutenant Jones, this is General Conlon, Centcom. Just wanted to commend you on your mission two nights ago, very impressive work. Which brings me to today. You've been briefed on your mission but for various reasons, you've not yet been briefed on the target. I'm here to tell you that your objective today is the kill or capture of Hassan El Sherie, the top mastermind of the oil attacks, as you know. It's a huge base that we think they're holed up in and we've had it under constant bombardment for the last seven hours. (canon fire) We've taken out the airfield, taken out the armor, and we've forced them underground, but we're still bombarding them now. Shortly we'll be sending in Bravo team with a ground convoy and your teams via helicast. Is that all understood? Roger that, Sir, I'll brief the men. UH-1's in attack formation. Just gonna lay down some covering fire. Red 995, take 'em high. Roger that. We're obstructed right now. Let me know when you get in. Will do. You're clear. I'm just trying to find targets again. (gunfire and explosions) Headed for the drop off point. Drop. Drop. Drop. All units head west to the rendezvous about 1.3 clicks to the west. Be aware that this place was built on a huge system of old military tunnels. Nobody knows how old they are or what's really down there. El Sherie's bunker is deep underground. We've located a point where you can blast your way into those tunnels and find that bunker. Clear! Take only a small team. The tunnels should be mostly empty but who knows what you're gonna find down there. We've heard that even many of the locals refuse to go inside. We don't know the reason. Maybe superstition, maybe something else. All our intel says Hassan El Sherie will be in that room. It's like a maze down there. The path to your bunker is marked on your e-maps. It's just 200 meters to the objective, down here. Shh, I think there's soldiers coming. Quick, down here. I think they're behind us. I think we lost them. Since war is at stake, your mission is to find the bunker, capture or eliminate the target. This is it. This is the bunker. Sir, there's nobody here. Nothing. (phone ringing) Agent Fife speaking. This has been going on for too long, Fife. I need you back here and no excuses. I've just got too much going on to have one of my most experienced agents off on some wild goose chase. Just give me a couple more days, Captain. This could be important. Well, have you got anything that's actually concrete in hand? Well, we've narrowed down the search. I want you back here, Fife. First thing tomorrow morning, in this office. Don't let me down. Meanwhile the US-led fleet is now just 7 hours from entering North Korean waters. China has warned the United States that it will not sit idly by and allow North Korea to be attacked, but so far has made no move to intervene. The US ground invasion force, meantime, has approached to within 130 miles of Pyeong Yang, with very few losses so far. You're going to break into contact anytime. Copy that. Hold on back there. (speaking in foreign language) We're seeing a lot of movement up ahead. Better hold onto something. (speaking in foreign language) There's a civilian vehicle approaching. (explosion booms) We're hit! Roll over! (phone ringing) Nancy speaking. (cellphone rings) Hello? Caleb? It's Sue. Wow, I can't believe you got through on the cellphone. Caleb, it's about Aaron. The transport he was in has been hit. Is he okay? He's in a coma. The driver is dead and four of the other soldiers. They're transporting him to one of the aircraft carriers. You know, the big fleet. Look, that's probably a good thing. Those ships have probably some of the best medical facilities on the planet. He'll be well taken care of there. He said he wasn't going to make it back. Listen. Don't worry, he'll be fine. He's probably in the best place he can be. It is now just 30 minutes before the US-led fleet enters North Korean waters. The fleet is now headed by three Aircraft Carriers and numbers 70 vessels, including ships from Japan, Canada and South Korea. Both China and Russia have issued severe warnings to the United States, but so far have taken no action to intervene. Just five minutes now until the first US ships cross into North Korean waters. The US claims to have taken out, not just every nuclear site, but also every airfield in North Korea. The big question on everyone's lips is, what kind of nasty surprises North Korea has waiting for the allies when they arrive. A reminder that we will stay with this live feed from the region as the first US ships now cross into North Korean waters. What is clear is that the United States is in total control of the skies, making them seemingly impervious to real danger. Sir, I'm showing a large metallic object rising off the seafloor. A submarine? Negative. Wrong shape. It's rising right beneath us. Man battle-stations. (explosion booms) I don't know what happened here, we had everything in the world drop out. (somber music) We apologize for that loss of transmission. We suddenly lost all our feeds from the fleet, and we are still unable to contact any of the ships. Satellite imagery is not yet available, but there are reports of an enormous flash of light around the time that we lost contact. Some are speculating that what we are seeing is the result of a nuclear attack, but this cannot yet be confirmed. Boom! Boom! More! News just in that we have a new live feed from 2 Navy helicopters headed for the region. The ship you see in the distance is the USS Bainbridge, which is also headed at top speed for the area where the fleet was last seen. In what could be one of the darkest days in US history, the helicopters are closing in on the search area now. As you can see, at least one ship remains above water, though clearly very badly damaged. The pilots are reporting to us that they think this is the USS Crommelin, one of the destroyers at the very back of the fleet. Coming in closer now. You can see the huge billows of smoke. They've tried signaling the ship with no response. Very difficult to imagine anyone surviving under those conditions. The other helicopter is reporting one more ship, seemingly the USS Ogden which again was one of the vessels at the very back of the fleet. You can see this ship is in much worse shape. Looks like it's very close to sinking. From what the pilots are saying, these seem to be the only two vessels for miles around. Not even a lot of wreckage left behind. If the rest of the fleet has indeed gone down, that makes this by far the worst maritime disaster in allied history, with possibly more than 30,000 lives lost. (phone ringing) Mike, it's total chaos here. Look I think we might have found the hub you're looking for. It's at the end of a dirt road, not too far from your location. I'm going to send you over the coordinates now. Yeah, I've got it. Be careful how you approach. Copy that. I'll call you when I get there. Confirmation through from the Chinese Government that indeed this was a nuclear device, but they are claiming the North Koreans were acting in self defense. The Chinese say that if the US retaliates with nuclear weapons against North Korea, then China will be forced to strike back. (phone ringing) Hello, Sue? Caleb. Did you see, Aaron was on those ships? I, I know, I know and I'm so sorry. Listen, listen, there's something you need to do immediately. You need to get yourself out of the city right now. You can't afford to stop and grieve right now. Listen to me, The US will counter strike and the Chinese may well get involved. We're talking nuclear war here. Okay, you need to leave right now. No, no, I don't understand. In half an hour the roads will be clogged with people trying to leave the city, okay? What, where? (static buzzing) Caleb? Sue can you hear me? Caleb? Sue? Man battle-stations for C.E.T launch and spinup missile C.E.T-3. Subcon aye. (military chatter) Launch is authorized. (dramatic music) What do you do when you're on a countdown to nuclear war? Attention all stations. ESE, we're performing a log status check verifying to resume the count and go for launch. - OCC. - We are go. - TCC. - TCC is go for launch, Sir. - MILON. - MILON TN is go for launch. - STM. - STM is go. - SRO. - SRO is go. You have a range clear to launch. Launch minus 4 minutes 30 seconds and counting. Minus 1 minute 35 seconds and counting. Minus 1 minute 10 seconds and counting. Minus 1 minute mark and counting. Minus 45 seconds and counting. Minus 35 seconds. Minus 27 seconds. 20 seconds and counting. In the 20th century you people lost their faith. In the 21st century they lose their civilization. In the 20th century you people lost their faith. In the 21st century they lose their civilization. 10, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
