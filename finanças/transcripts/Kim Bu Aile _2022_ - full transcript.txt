We're going on a big hunt, guys. The head of the gang is... Cigan. His right-hand man, Salih, will get the goods. Our goal is to be present at this exchange and catch Salih in the act. If Salih talks, we can catch both Cigan and the distributors. You packaged it well. Mücahit, don't touch it. Don't touch it! I was only checking it, sir. 33-99, police station. Sir, if we wait any longer, we are going to miss them. Over. 33-70, we won't go in until we see something. Sir, why would we? We can't wait any longer. 33-90? All units. We are going in on my order. Do you copy? The director didn't approve it. The commissioner gave his approval, Onur. Enough talk. Come on, gear up! - Come on, guys. - Come on. I can't see the bag, Salih. No cash, no delivery. Come on, my brave boys. Mr. Cigan was quite specific. He wants us to pay the full amount of the account. The payment... will be made this way. On the count of three. Set the mechanisms. - Something's wrong with it. - We're going in, okay? Mücahit, don't play with that, goddammit! - Wait, I'll unlock it. - One... - You idiot! - I'm coming, sir! Damn it! Holy shit! Sir, the mechanism is stuck. Don't get me started on your mechanism! - You made me fall, idiot! - Don't panic. Come down! Now! Come down then! Come down! Goddamn it! What the hell are you doing? - It fucking hurts! - You crushed me, you idiot! It was a rapid descent, sir. - I'm really sorry. - Just walk. Sir, we can't see anything. We can't see anything. Stop! Cut the smoke bombs off! Who's doing that? We can't see anything. They are always so literal. Do it right for once, man! Oh my God. Commissioner, Salih and his men are not here. Good morning. Damn it, it's so obvious. We have the goods, boss. I will kill you, Cigan. I will kill you all! Tekin, please don't take offense. You're not the first or last person I've stolen goods from. It's nothing personal, it's just business. Salih, could you please give Mr. Tekin the rest of his payment? Okay. Pack up, we're leaving... - Don't shoot, it's just a kid! - That's a kid, stop. Come here, boy! - Stop! Police! - Sir, he is behind you. Don't run! Stop right there, boy! Sir, I'll be right behind you! Stop it! What's going on? Look at that kid! What is going on? - Stop! - What is going on? - I'm a cop. - A cop? - Stop. - I'll give it to you, okay? Hey! - What are you doing? - You blocked the road. 3399. Our operation has failed. You threw smoke bombs like you were throwing confetti at a wedding. You went into the building through the window. Operations, crew, special equipment. Eight cars hit, five overturned, thirteen damaged vehicles. Four traffic lights knocked over. A courier bike. There's no bus stop nearby. How could you damage two buses? Sir, it was twelve damaged vehicles, not thirteen. The hood of the last one was already damaged. Insurance fraud. Okay, Mücahit. Did you just shoot a movie? Huh? What are those? What is this? Don Quixote, Adem? You're right, sir. You're right. We received orders. You're suspended. Suspended? Hand over your gun and your badge. Just rest for a while. We'll talk about it later. How, sir? After all of his hard work? You suspend a great man just like that? - What are you talking about? - Shut up, Mücahit. Sir, if you're suspending him, you should suspend us too. Okay. Hand over your gun. What did you do? Sir, I have already submitted my petition to you. As you know, I want to change teams. - Yes, I know. - Oh, man. Oh, man. Okay, man. I'm on it. Thanks. Sir, step out of the vehicle and follow me. POLICE Okay. You're missing some documents. Excuse me? What is that? You're drunk too. Take 10 steps and walk in a straight line. Drunk? At this time of the day? I'm not drunk. Let me blow into your breathalyzer. I don't want any trouble, so either walk over there or get in the car and I'll take you to the police station. I help you blow whatever you want to blow. My car! Hey, they are stealing my car! - I'm reporting a stolen vehicle, over. - They're stealing my car! Hey, is the bag in the car? Great job! I'll be right there. - Pull over! - Pull over, damn it! - Pull over! - Okay, okay. - Pull over! - Pull over! - It says Patti, sir. - Patti. Patti. Carry on. There's more. - Is there more? - Yes, I can see it. - Really? - Look, here. "Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality." Municipality. What did I tell you? Sir, you told me that... this... You said "Steal the bag of the man whom you thought have gang ties." Okay, I stole it. We have the bag. - My friend has it. - I said bag, right? - You said bag, sir. - Bag. We said bag. A hostile act against the municipal police. - We said bag, right? - Yes. We said bag. Then what are those? How can you act on your own accord? Pretending to be a police officer and stopping the people on the road? Explain yourself! What if the man found out that the uniform and the car were fake? What if he had asked for your registration number? What if he had offered to bribe you to avoid a fine? What if your indecent character would've gotten even worse? How can we think of everything? Don't make me mad! Sir, wait a minute. How can we think of everything? - How can we think of everything? - Okay, sir. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. I'm done. This deal is over. Forget about Germany and your father. The deal is off. - What? - It's over. What do you mean, sir? Why even bother with this if my record won't be cleared? Take me to the police station. Come on, put on those handcuffs. Put them on. - What are you doing? - Put them on! - Stop. - What are you doing? Look at this stupid-ass. Please, sir. Put me in jail if you want but don't scrap our deal. Please. Huh? I've been suspended, Ali. What? Ali, I've been suspended. Suspended, Ali. What's so hard to understand? Ali, we've been suspended! So... even if I wanted to, I can't keep my promise. - Sir, let me punch him. - No. Oh, my dear Lord! Look at this. - Look at this! - What's happening? My dear father is waiting for me in Germany. He wants me to be the Döner King. Where am I going? Where? Why are you doing dumb shit? Why did you get yourself suspended? Is this okay to you? To hell with you! Are you justifying your actions and questioning mine? Did you get carried away pretending to be a cop? Did you? Give me that over here. Listen to me! I'll sew this onto you, I'll sew this fake uniform onto you. I'll sew this onto you. Stay away from me or I'll kill you. Oh, God! It's a text message. They sent a photo of what's inside the bag. Take it. Take it, sir. - Take it. - Calm down. Talk properly. Take it. It can help you. Wait a second. Just as I suspected. Look! Salih and his men took out the other gang and took the goods. Now they need a place to hide. They will lie low until they hear from Cigan. Okay, okay, but do they... Where will they be hiding? They won't just be hiding. They'll also be planning their next move. But what is their next move, sir? That's another mystery to us. If we find out where they're hiding and follow Salih, we can find out what they're planning. - And then... - Yes? Then we might get the chance to catch them in the act. Then we can bring down Salih, Cigan, and the whole gang. - And... - And? - And... - And? We will be reinstated, man. We could even get promoted, sir. Promoted! - Well done. We'll get promoted. - Stop that! Let me take the phone and I'll... - Give it to me! - What the hell? - I'll kill you! - Just a second. I can help you with this, for real. You saw how I found these. I can be useful to you. Get your jobs back and help me with my criminal record. Please? I want a clean start. That's all. Sir, the first photo was taken in Ortaköy. - Welcome to Turkey. Welcome. - Hello. Where is... that? Eminönü is good place. Topkapı, you know! What are you talking about? Did you see the men? - Welcome, welcome to Turkey. Welcome. - Hello. Sure, it's edible. No, sis. No, it's bird eating. We can't find them. I'm gonna go nuts. We've searched all over Istanbul. We will find them. Don't worry. We found them. - Huh? - We found them, Müco. - Those guys going in are Salih's men. - Yes, they are. It's definitely them, sir. For sure. Because they all look ugly. - Really? - Right. Then with your looks, you should be rotting in prison. Why are we talking about me again? - What are we gonna do? - We need to monitor the place. - Okay. - I didn't see Salih but... he might come here too. Okay, sir, we found the men. We know where they are. How will we monitor them? How will we track them and eavesdrop on them? On second thought, the most important question is how are we gonna sneak in there? That's a mystery to us. - The owner is coming. - Huh? BRAVE CHICKEN RESTAURANT Thank you. Bon appétit. - He's suspicious of us. - Right? This is bad. We have to deal with him. How? Pizza boys are constantly going in and out of there. If we can make a deal with him, we could keep an eye on them from this chicken restaurant. We could go in there as delivery guys and install some cameras and bugs. - Such an incredible mind, right? - Yes, excellent. I'll go talk to the owner. - Should we come along? - Yes, come. Let's persuade him together. Hello, sir. We... We love chicken-themed atmospheres. And we're very good at the chicken business. We saw this place, and we love it. We really love this place. And we talked about it. We said, "Hey, why we don't we see if we can work here?" So we thought we'd ask you. - The three of you? - Yes, three for the price of one. We can drink water from the tap. For this price, we'd even be eager to be your slaves. This is a very profitable deal. It could've happened in the past, but now, it is impossible. Because tomorrow morning, I'll be handing over this shop to a family. FOR RENT BY THE RESTAURANT OWNER Melahat. My dear wife. My sauced chicken drumstick. When she died, this restaurant and I died with her. This place was once a welcoming and popular family restaurant. The chicks are all orphans now. The rooster is unpleasant. And the eggs are all broken. Do you guys understand what he's saying? I still remember her final words to me. What did she say? She said, "Sabahattin." And I replied, "Yes, my double yolk egg?" "When I die, let the Brave Chicken, which we raised ourselves, be handed over to a family like us." "Or else I will die in disappointment!" And then she died. I couldn't say, "Melahat!" "Where can I find a family as good as ours in this day and age?" You just can't find one. You can't. It's really hard these days. You have found it, Sabahattin. You've found it. We are that family. We'll take over this place. We'll run this place. We'll take over this place. I need to get involved at this point, sir. We'll discuss this first and then get back to you. - There's no need. - Yes, there is. Dude! Why are you taking the initiative here? What were you thinking? We don't have any money or a family! How can we run this place? If there's a better way to watch those men, I'd like to hear it. There isn't. So for God's sake, please trust me. I will find people to fill the family role. I'll take care of it. You can take care of the rest. This is your operation. All right, let's take over this restaurant. Let's do this. I could sell my car, and I have some dowry money I could use. This is a great place. Let's buy this restaurant. I've always wanted my own chicken restaurant. Come on, sir. If the business is to grow this much, everything must be done by the book. What don't you understand? Sir, like I said inside, I need to return to duty. What do you mean you have to return to duty? Is this your father's shop? You've been punished for disobeying orders. Even if a theft occurs in front of you, you cannot intervene. You'll call Onur. Onur? Why would I call Onur? Commissioner Onur. Commissioner Onur? He's done well since he left your team. He was promoted after his first operation. Tell Onur what you wanted to tell me. He'll handle your cases from now on. If you promise not to disgrace us again, tell me what it is and I'll do what is necessary. All right, Adem? Memduh. I'm calling Memduh. Memduh from Intelligence? Hello, Memduh? How are you, Memduh? Memduh, sorry for calling you this late at night. Sorry for disturbing you. I wanted to ask a favor. Could I borrow your wife and kids for a few weeks? We want to use them for an urgent operation. Yes, it's a very important operation. Hello? Memduh? - Memduh? - Where's the pepper? He hung up. He literally hung up. You're eating everything, man. Just stop. - You'd eat the car too. - But I'm hungry. Why are you so hungry? Who else is there? Who else could I call? What I don't understand is, you lost your family because you loved your job too much. Your daughter and wife left you, leaving you lonely and miserable. Then that new guy Onur comes in, and he takes over that operation my commissioner has been running. This is bullshit. I can't accept that. - I'm gonna call Ali. - Please don't. - I'm gonna call him. - No, not Ali. If we get Ali involved, we will be exposed. Then how's it gonna go? You wouldn't want any help from your wife or Deniz either, would you? - From my wife and Deniz? - Yes. My wife who divorced me because of my job and my daughter whom I stopped from becoming a cop? I would seek help from them? Really? How will we accomplish this if you say no to everything? What if Sabahattin gives that shop to that other family tomorrow? We will lose our only chance to do this. Am I wrong? Tell me if I'm wrong. How will it go then? The director will be proven right and Onur will talk behind our backs. And we will be left empty-handed. For God's sake, Commissioner, you are my idol. You're the Istanbul Police Department's number one officer. It takes only one piece of intelligence for you to solve this issue. I know it. I just know it. Let's call Ali. - Wait, Deniz is calling me. - Deniz is calling you? I'll just text her. Does she know we've been suspended? "Daughter, don't keep calling me. I'm on duty." How do I tell my dad that I became a cop without his knowledge? This was his worst nightmare. Go and see him. Don't do this over the phone, Deniz. Show him that you're a police officer. Sure, I've already found them, sir. Sure. We will bring our new family to you tomorrow. Okay. I'm on the run from the cops, and you say I'll be the commissioner's son? Tell me, what's the plan? Well, bro, we will all get what we need. Now the fear of the police and going to jail is over. That's over! Tomorrow morning, we'll make a brand-new start. I'm taking this. - I'll be off now. - Where are you going? - To get our mother. - Our mother? No, Ali, this isn't going to happen. Cansu, what are you doing, girl? Come on, Menekşe. Why won't you do this? Tell me why. Just wear the ring for once! I've been begging for you. This is a nice restaurant. It'd be a fresh start for you. Please say "yes." You, me, and Umut. Save that poor orphan. So, what do you say? When this game is over, that chicken restaurant will be mine. Sure. We'll see about that. - What are you saying? - Fine, it will be yours. Good. I listened to you and rushed everything, Mücahit. Without planning ahead, how do you start a family this way? You thought thoroughly before. What happened, Commissioner? You were left all alone. - What are you saying? - What am I saying? I'm asking what you said. You're muttering to yourself. I was just talking to myself, Commissioner. You're not talking to yourself, I'm here with you. - Don't look right. Look at the restaurant. - I'll take a quick look. Just look at the road and the restaurant. - I was fast. Relax. - Look at the restaurant. I'm looking at it. It looks closed. I'll have a look. Who the hell is this? Don't call me, girl. Your father has been suspended. They have destroyed your father. Don't call me, Deniz. He's coming. Good morning to you all. What, did you sleep in front of the shop? Sabahattin, we are ready to take over the restaurant. Cancel things with the other family and give us the restaurant. Where is the rest of the family? I can't see them. Oh, they are on their way. - Right? - They're coming. Hello, dear. - Hello. - Father. Sabahattin, let me introduce you. - The mother, the one and only, Menekşe. - Nice to meet you. This is Müco and my brother Umut, the tiniest one of the pack. Umut, turn around. If we hadn't stopped my parents, they would have had more children. We nearly couldn't stop them. - They are like rabbits. - Come here. - Come here! Don't run! - What is happening? - Umut, where are you going? - Come here! Umut! Boy, get over here! Where do you think you're going? What is happening? The men in our family are like this. Always a fight, always a quarrel. Mr. Sabahattin, let me tell you... Umut! Why do you come into my life at the most critical moments and then run back out? What is happening, sir? Why don't you ask him? Why were you running? I had nothing to do with it, I swear. I found an empty building to sleep in. The cops went in, and this guy chased me. Don't talk to me like that! - Okay, sir. - I'll kill you. - I didn't steal anything. - He didn't steal anything. Then why were you running? Because you're a cop. Oh, so I chose the wrong profession. My apologies. - So I'm the guilty one? - Kind of. - Get him away from here... - Okay! - ...or else I'll literally kill him. - Okay. Take him away. I got it. Just calm down for a minute. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But, sir, he's a nice boy. Ali, you have a strange way of doing business. The boy you introduced as my son is a thief! You might as well ask a woman from a night club to be my wife. You know Menekşe? Don't. I mean it. Don't. Man, don't be ridiculous! Damn it! Bring all your criminal acquaintances. Bring as many acquaintances as you can with this Menekşe woman. We will make a really great family. We... How will we convince Sabahattin? How will we make him believe us? Only you know who we are. How would he know? We need this mission more than you do, sir. This is our only chance to wipe our records clean. Oh, look how cute you are. Look at you. Let me just open a record cleaning office. Bring me all of your friends who are convicted criminals. Let's clear them too. - Is that what I'm saying? - What are you saying? Sir, I was gonna block them off from the back alley, but it was a dead end. Let's go to the restaurant. Sabahattin is waiting for us. Okay, we won't make him wait, then what? - Don't you recognize this boy? - Who is he? - You really don't remember? - Okay, Salih. - Are you testing me? - Okay. - We're at the place. - He said "Salih." - He said "Salih." - Oh, those jerks. Sir, this is our last chance. I'm afraid this is the family we have. It will all end with you catching those guys in the act. You will get your job back and we'll have our freedom. Just trust us a little. Yes? What? Menekşe struck a deal with Sabahattin. She's waiting for us. Okay, we're on our way. We'll be right there. Did you see Müco? He went, just like that. We're going too. Aren't we, sir? Let's go. I'll handle the situation. Don't run! Just walk! Don't piss him off. Don't run, Umut! And these should be for the captain's wheelhouse. It looks very nice. The atmosphere in here has transformed in an instant. You're just like Melahat and I in our youth. Always bickering, always racketing. I love cheerful and energetic families. It's clear that you have a strong bond. As Miss Menekşe said, a family that eats at the same table will not suffer any evil. So long as he doesn't make the appetizers, right? - That eggplant incident? - Yes. Baba Ghanoush Adem! - You told him about that? - Yes. The eggplant incident? The baba ghanoush? That was a great story. Can we take over the restaurant now? Dad? My daughter? You're fast! I sent you the location and you're already here. Well done. Adem, who is this girl? Why did she call you Dad? You said that you stopped after three boys. My love. My dear girlfriend. What a nice surprise! You said you couldn't make it. - My love? - My love. Let me introduce you, Sabahattin. This is my beautiful fiancée... Deniz. I love that name so much! Welcome, my daughter. Don't make us miss you! Congratulations. I wish you a happy marriage. Amen, Sabahattin. Let go of her hand. Come on. Adem, the shop and minibus are now entrusted to you. I'll take that. Good luck with it, guys. - Good luck. - Thank you, Sabahattin. - Thank you for everything. - Thank you. And the rest is as we agreed. - Please don't forget to buy these. - Of course. Come and visit us again. Can somebody tell me what is going on here? BRAVE CHICKEN My dear girl, why are you listening to Mücahit? All of the team has gathered here. We're in the middle of a secret operation. How can you just come over here without my knowledge? Do you answer my calls, Dad? Well, dear, you came here and saw me. We've caught up with each other. Now, go back to Ankara. Come on. I'm not going anywhere, Dad. I came here to talk to you. She doesn't want to go. What if she doesn't leave? The role of being the man's wife is over and now we're pretending to be cops? Listen to me. The commissioner will catch these guys in the act in a few days. He'll get his information and return to duty. - Then we'll have our freedom. - I hope so. Okay, come on. I'm listening. - Dad... - Yes, dear? Dad, I'm always making the effort. It's your turn now. I'll stay with you. Otherwise, I won't ever see your face again. That's all. Don't you know what I do for a living? Huh? Do you know what I'm doing here? What kind of fantasies are running through your head? Menekşe's son Umut is helping you with this mission, so I'll help you too. I stopped you from becoming a cop so that you wouldn't be harmed. Now you wanna join our operation? How are you gonna help us? You gonna work the cash desk and patch things up? Yes, Dad. I'm gonna patch things up. I'm gonna patch things up between us. If not, I'll tell the restaurant's owner that these guys aren't a family. Let's see if he'll give you his restaurant when he hears you're running an operation. If she blabs, I'm done for. Don't worry. It's an empty threat. I know Deniz. She won't follow through. - Theory and practice are different. - Ain't it, bro? - Just relax. - Deniz, please don't do that. - Let me go, Dad. - Deniz! - Deniz, don't be rash. - She's leaving. Do something! - I don't wanna hear it. - Deniz, wait a minute! Okay, stop. Let me say something. You'll do as I say. You will just stand in that kitchen and take no risks. We'll have some quality time together for a few days and then you go home. Okay? Okay! So, we're playing a family and a team of cops at the same time? We were orphaned criminals until now. Let's just enjoy being a family and being cops. Okay? Shall we begin our mission, Commissioner? Yes. You just crushed me. You've crushed my back. You're great! What? What is that? Who? CLOSED Listen here. Did anything go wrong that we didn't expect? OPERATION I wish it hadn't, but it did, unfortunately. I spoiled her a lot when she was little. That's normal. Okay, please pay attention! Tell me, why are we here? - I want to get out of parole. - May God be my witness... - This is really important to me. - I'd like to return to work. - No, no. - We'll open a döner franchise? - With my father. - No. You all have your own personal reasons to be here right now, but there is only one way to accomplish all this. And that is if I can catch and record Salih and Cigan in the act. Then I can inform the senior officers and return to duty. You just do what we want, the rest is not our concern. Of course it is, Miss Menekşe. Menekşe is fine. There's no need for intimacy. She didn't tell you. No, she didn't. Okay then. Pay attention, guys. One. We do not reveal our identity under any circumstances. - Under any circumstances. - Under any circumstances. Let's get into character and become a chicken restaurant family. Character and chicken. Two, secret audio and video surveillance. That'll be my job, sir. I'll grab the equipment from the police station. - Fine. - Sure. I've got the chicken. What are we doing now? What are we doing now? Everyone will go to their station. Mücahit, you bring the equipment. We are wandering around as a family, our eyes are open. And you, daughter, you go and sit in the kitchen. Stay with the chicken. I hope you get bored and go home. Everyone to their stations! - I'm sorry. - Sorry. Okay, Selda. I'm doing what you told me to do. I'll prove to my dad that I'm a police officer. - That board is fascinating, isn't it? - Yeah. This is how our job is. There's always a puzzle that needs solving, there's always information to obtain, there're dangerous missions. - Our work is never finished. - Sounds tough. Yeah, it's really tough. Are you a new member of my dad's team? I've never seen you on my dad's team before. I only work with him on secret missions. Top secret. Yeah. Tell me about yourself. What do you do? - How is your cooking going? - Cooking? I thought you were studying cooking in Ankara. Your dad told us. - Yes, I study cooking. - Yes, I know. - It's great. It's fun. I love it. - That's great. I'm a great cook. - Really? - Yeah. When I go to Germany, I'd like to open a döner franchise with my father. - So you will quit being a police officer? - Police officer? Being a police officer? How could I quit being a police officer? It's in our blood. - Ali! - I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Excuse me, Miss Menekşe. If I ever see you lurking around my daughter again, I'll kill you. What do you mean? You have bad intentions. You can forget about Germany. - What does this have to do with Germany? - Shut up. Mücahit didn't get the equipment anyway. - How come? - I don't know. - Müco? - Yes. I couldn't do it. How are we gonna monitor these guys without audio and video? What can I do, sir? My contact there went on vacation. No way. And his replacement said, "What is this, your dad's shop?" - You should've said it was. - I wish. Yeah. Aren't you guys on a mission? You need written permission to get those cameras. As I know. You told me that when I was a kid. Yes, my daughter is right. They need to give us permission in writing. Things may not go as planned. Red tapism, financial troubles... Yeah, it happens all the time. Yes, of course. I've been an officer for about... I've had this happen to me at least three or four times. Okay, you see. You've seen how complex and difficult your father's job can be because of this. We have no choice but to put a device on those men's phones. Mücahit? I will do it. Just get me their phones and I'll sort it out in 90 seconds. There's just one problem, though. - How are we gonna get their phones? - Well... I can get 'em. It'll be a piece of cake. - What do you mean? - No stealing! Let's think of a way to scam them. What do you mean "scam them"? If we flirt a little, we can blow their minds. Well done. So nice to see all of you like this, doing inappropriate things. Who else wants to screw it up? Anything to add, Mücahit? - Let him steal them. - Tell us something. Come on. - Oh my God! - Hello, guys. - Welcome. - Welcome. I always have a spare key. Sabahattin! Sabahattin! We love you so much, but... Why do you come here unexpectedly and without permission? Come here. Don't you remember? He said he'd come for an inspection. Yes, I did say that. Sabahattin, we've scrubbed that kitchen clean with our own hands. Very nice. - Let me show you. - Good luck! Hello, Sabahattin. Hello. What have you come to inspect, dear Sabahattin? It's the same kitchen and restaurant, just a little cleaner. Here. Here you are. Well done. Everything is so clean. Well done. But... Why aren't your son and his fiancée wearing rings? Oh, dear Sabahattin... Dear Sabahattin, is that the only thing on your mind? My beautiful wife had to scrape some asphalt-like dirt from the fryer. Oh, come on... My brain is spinning from the smell of bleach. But all you think about is our rings? - Well... - Listen. You can come over whenever you want, but don't ask so many questions. Give me that key. - How many copies do you have? - No, no. Let me explain it this way. Since we spent everything we have on this place, we've had to postpone the engagement. My husband is really sensitive about this. Doesn't this girl have any family? - Yes. She has a great father. - She had a family. She had a great father, sir. - She also had a mother. - And? Unfortunately, they both died. - What? - Yeah. We're the only family she has. - What a pity. - But don't you worry. We will deal with this engagement issue as soon as we can. When will we complete the handover process, Sabahattin? I feel so sorry for her. What a pity. The restaurant will be mine. That's why I'm asking. Sure. Sure. Oh, poor girl! My condolences, my dear. May God rest their souls. My condolences. Thank you. I feel so sorry for her. Doesn't she have any other relatives? - She only has us. - Poor dear. To be left like this at her age. Have a good evening. Thanks. You buried my daughter's real family. Well done, Menekşe. Then you should have been nice to him instead of being mean, Commissioner. Mean? I'm the mean one? - Thank you. - Look at me. - Let's deal with this ring issue ASAP! - What ring issue? How can Menekşe talk to her superior like that? I won't let my daughter wear a ring. She's being the head of the household. Good for her. Of course. Flip that board over, Mücahit. Let me explain our plan for tomorrow. Here's the plan. You know him too. - Did you call Ibo? - I did. Everything's ready. They're coming. Let's start. Don't do anything stupid. Everyone will listen to me. - Okay, sir, don't worry. - Okay. Sir? Sir? Sir. - Sir! - What? - Let's begin. - Yes. Come on. Showtime. Come on, Umut. - Play your part. - Let me help you. Let me do it. It's really heavy. Hello, guys. - Hello. - Hi. Could you help us carry those boxes to the minibus? - Sure. - Leave it to us. My husband went to the farmhouse, and I've been left alone here with my son. Lift these, bro. You lifted those so easily! Well done, son. Give these men a hand. Give me those. Take those. You're so much stronger than us with all those muscles. It's a piece of cake for you, huh? Move it, brother. Come on, boy. Give that to me. Come on, be quick. - We're depending on you. - Okay. Well done, boy. - Okay. It's started. - Is it loading? Is that it? Is there anything else we can help you with? Can you also take these and load them onto the minibus? - Those are pine trees. - Those belong to the Municipality. But my boy wants them. - Okay then. - We'll do it. This must really be a piece of cake for you! Hurry up, man. You said it would only take 90 seconds. Menekşe had the guys set up a memorial forest outside. Come on, man. Three, two, one. Done. - Hurry, Umut! Well done, boy. Go! - Here. He runs like a horse. He was a good choice. - Congratulations. - We did it. Here, boy, help us. - Hold it here. Wait a minute. - Help them, dear. Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you. Thank you so much, guys. When we open the restaurant, the first thing I'll do is prepare a really great meal for you guys. We'll stop by from time to time. You're always welcome. - Take care. Have a good day. - Have a good day. - Is there anything? - We should get something now. - Yes, it's on. - Really? They are on the speaker. That woman from the chicken restaurant was so hot. - What the... - She was such a milf, man... - Whoa, whoa! - Such a milf, man. They're not only drug smugglers, they're perverts too. When did they have time to look at Menekşe? ...those lousy pine trees, to the fucking farmhouse... I wish Deniz was here too. - What did you say? - That kid didn't help us at all. If she were here, she'd be proud of you and your success. That's all. She did hit on you, man. We haven't succeeded at anything. It all depends on them giving us a clue. So you're saying that they are not cops? Impossible. Help me out, Selda. Find out from the inside. Let's see who this Ali guy is. What is it, Mücahit? They've been watching TV since this morning. You should have threatened him. How long will we be watching TV for, Salih? Salih. We need to wait. We need to wait till we hear from Cigan. Then we can get down to business. What was that? What did he say? When they move away from the phone, our audio drops out. But we can fill in the blanks with our superior intelligence. We've got him, Mücahit. We've caught him this time. He said they will hear from Cigan! Salih is here. So why don't we go and tell the director? Here's Salih. Now go and arrest him. No, we can't. We need to find something bigger to show the director. We'll wait until they hear from Cigan. Now you sound like a true commissioner! If you're going to have them arrested, do it properly. Whatever you need, we'll always be beside you. Thank you so much, but that acetone is not suitable for indoor spaces. Shall we take the acetone outside? Put that away. Fine. Salih. My wallet is missing. When I went to the market, I realized that it was missing. You're joking, right? What if that kid from the restaurant stole it? What restaurant? - The chicken restaurant has new owners. - Umut. They wanted our help this morning. Then let's pay a visit to that chicken restaurant and see if they are really cooking chicken. - Umut! - Calm down! - Where... - Umut! Where are you? - Where is he? - Bring him to me. - Umut! - I don't think Umut took it. They are coming here! - They are confused. - How? They called him a thief. I told you I didn't want to work with them. - I told you a thousand times. - Wait. What do you mean "them"? All we've done is help you. Okay, Miss Menekşe. Don't get offended so quickly! Now's not the time. They'll be here any minute. Please get in that kitchen. Get in there. Come on! Right now! If anything happens, leave the restaurant through the rear. Ali, is the door locked? - Don't just stand there. Tidy up! - What do I do? I'm fighting here in front line. I will greet them. Battle will be fought here. In this way! We'll pretend we've recently opened. I'll greet them here and stop them if necessary. Uncle Sabahattin. Uncle Sabahattin? Who are they? Is this how you honor Aunt Melahat? These are my neighbors. We want some chicken. But we haven't opened the restaurant yet. You really are obsessed with chicken, Sabahattin. How can that be? You've been cooking it all your life. Take your friends and find somewhere else to eat. - Make them go somewhere else. - Okay, I'll deal with it. - Please make them go. - Okay, Dad. Here you go, Sabahattin. Here you go. Here you go, Sabahattin. Dad! Daddy! Dad! Brave Chicken. Chicken has never tasted this good. Welcome to our restaurant. We're open for delivery. You can't run a restaurant like that. You're choosing customers. The deal is off! Sabahattin. I'll cry if you keep doing this. I didn't say anything because you're part of the family. Please, for God's sake! - Okay, let's have a seat. - Sit, please. - Sit somewhere. - Here you go. - What is his problem? - It's because we didn't open it properly. I'm so tense. We couldn't open the restaurant properly. If we can open it, then I can relax. But I couldn't do it and I'm not comfortable with... Well, with customers sitting inside the restaurant. But we're fine with doing home deliveries. So... - We're kind of open. - Yes. You just took over the shop? Yes, as a family. You are not that family. - Who is this family? - This is my family. Once they get their photo taken, they'll hang it up there. We took over this restaurant from Mr. Sabahattin. I heard that you have a young son. - Umut? - Shut up. Yes, I have a young son. Unfortunately. I told my wife many times that having a third kid in this day and age is so unreasonable. But as you can see, we have the third child. Why? What happened? Did he do something wrong? When the boys were helping your wife this morning, one of them lost his wallet. - Wallet? - Wallet? You? Oh, I'm so sorry about that. Did you lose it in here? If you did, we would've found it. I cleaned everywhere, Dad. Did they drop it outside? It's probably outside. This is a storage room. Just a boring storage room. Mom, I'm so tired. Give me five more minutes. Five more minutes, okay? He thinks you're his mom sending him to school. They're all tired from all the cleaning. They're talking in their sleep saying "I don't wanna go to school!" He thinks you're his mom. This is the door to the kitchen. Oh, my dear Adem. What are you doing, my Menekşe? The wallet is not important. We'll find it. More importantly, we're neighbors, right? - Sure. - Sure. - It's funny, isn't it? - We came here to welcome you. And we won't go empty-handed. - Three sauced chickens, please. - Okay, got it. Oh, my dear Adem. Let's set a proper and wonderful table for these ladies! Come on, Ali. That sauced chicken or whatever it is? Give us ten of those. Sure. The boys will come and get it. Ten Brave Chickens, for delivery. - I'll make them right now. - They will prepare a rich table for us. Such miserable store owners. But keep an eye on them anyway. We'll be here for another three to five days. Here. I took it out of habit. Then I didn't get a chance to give it to them. It's a habit. What can he do? It's a habit, he says. He wasn't at fault. He didn't touch anything. Come on. Don't give him a hard time. How can you call stealing people's wallets a habit? - Sir. - It can happen sometimes. No one offered that poor boy a decent life. Give him a decent life and decent prospects and then see how he does. - Don't be sad. - Oh, sir... - What? - Did you enjoy that? - What happened? - You upset him. - Who upset him? - Apologize. - I don't get it. - Apologize to him. Why should I apologize? Because you said all that stuff to him. Am I his father? Are we a real family? You're all getting carried away. Focus on the mission. Listen to me. Did anything go wrong that we didn't anticipate? Yes. I wish they hadn't happened. We need to turn this situation into a positive one. Thankfully, I always look on the bright side. Don't worry. Salih didn't suspect us and we haven't been exposed. - So what do we do now? - What can we do? This is a chicken restaurant, so let's cook some chicken. Let's convince these guys that we make some great food. We take their orders. And when we get into their house, we can place our secret cameras. Yes, then we will have 24/7 surveillance. That was lovely, Deniz. Let me kiss you. - Come here. Let me tell you something. - Huh? Let me tell you something. Come closer. - Come and kiss me, man. Kiss me! - What are you doing? - Try and kiss me! - What are you doing? - We have customers. - Kiss me! Sabahattin will hear you! Why are you always talking about kissing? Do we have to kiss each other? I was supposed to pretend to be asleep, but I actually fell asleep. Anyway, what's up? Well... Salih and Sabahattin and the other customers are expecting sauced chicken from us. BRAVE CHICKEN OPEN Move! Do your best! Hurry up! All right! Time's up. Let's see how you did. Gross. What is that? This is a chicken product. I'm good at it. Nice! Why are you testing me, God? Wow, this is delicious. - Who cooked this? - Let me taste it. Didn't you cook it? You're studying cooking, right? - Didn't you do it? - That's the thing, sir. Deniz specializes in cold appetizers and olive oil-based dishes. That's why... That's what she told me. When did she tell you that? Huh? - She... - She told him, okay? Cut it out. Man, this is delicious! - Well done, my dear. - This is so good. - Really? - You're like a chef. - You like it? - Yes. Then I'll handle the kitchen from now on. Well, since your chicken is delicious, you can go and serve it. Come on. - Okay. - Come on. Go! Come on. Quiet. The men are here. Don't forget about that wallet. Müco, prepare the food Ali made for takeout. You stay here. - What about me? - I don't know. Do some general management. BRAVE CHICKEN The Tasty Brave chickens are ready, Dad. Give it to me. Did you get the magnets? I did, 350 Turkish lira. Brave Chicken. Chicken has never tasted this good. I'm sure you've never had chicken like this. But next time, you don't have to come here to pick it up. We'll deliver it to you. Me or one of my boys can deliver it. Keep the change. Have a good day. He gave us a 50-lira tip. What's the total? He gave us 400, plus 50 for the tip. - Can I take it? - Yes, you take it. Kara. My wallet is right here. Damn. What are the odds? Did you do it? - I did. - Really? - I did it. - Well done. The cameras are ready. Look, Dad. It looks like it's ready for its mission. This is a teddy bear. Commissioner, look at its eyes. They can see everything. - Oh my God. - What? Well done, man. - Just like that? - Sure. We can install them wherever we want. Then we can enjoy the live broadcast on the big screen. This is really good, sir. Everything is ready to go. What could possibly go wrong? I wish those women would leave too. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. - Let me see it. - Well done, man! Hey, ladies? It's late, you all should go. Take your things and leave. He's fallen asleep. We need more of that chicken, five portions of it! Not five portions. Give us ten portions to take home. This is going to be my favorite restaurant. Girls, I have an idea. Instead of getting together at home, why don't we come here and eat chicken with all our friends? - Let's take some photos... - Yeah. ...and share them on social media. - Yes. Let this be my pleasure! My pleasure! PURGATIVE - LET UMUT MAKE THE CHICKENS OR MENEKŞE We need to stop this restaurant from becoming popular. Are we chicken chefs? Huh? - It was tough, but it's done now. - Immediately! - Am I supposed to do this too? - Here... - Some tea or coffee? - Here's your chicken. Cigan wants to meet us in two days' time. Will the meeting take place here? Is the boss coming here? We will see about that. He'll tell us the time and place. If that meeting is taking place there, we have two days to install those cameras. Chicken has never tasted this good. Yes? Man! - Yes. Two Brave menus. - Welcome. This restaurant is so popular thanks to your sauce. I can't do my job because I'm too busy serving chicken! Stop cooking so well! - What happened? - Mücahit, what are we doing here? We're just cutting onions. Deniz is stuck with us and won't go anywhere. SELDA I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S TEAM Thanks! Sabahattin is on our ass all the time. The restaurant is full of customers. What are we doing here, Mücahit? This is important! Brave Chicken is too popular. How can we prevent this? Here! I've found a solution that will dissuade people from coming here. TRIPLE THE PRICES Triple the prices? Yes. No one will pay this much for chicken. - Well done, girl. - Yes, that's right. Nobody else suggested tripling the prices? Yet again, the only one with a solution was my daughter. Well done, girl! I'm so glad you went to that culinary school. Bravo! Triple the prices. They may make faces at their customers, but they are creating art with their chicken. Eating at the Brave Chicken is now an indicator of social status. Let's get in there now. Don't forget the... Reservations only. Don't forget the rings. Okay, Sabahattin. I won't forget. We can't let you in! No, we don't have any seats left. We are full. We're fully booked. Don't come here. - Three drinks for table eight. - Coming! Adem. - Adem! - What? - What's wrong? - I have some bad news. What could be worse than our current situation? For God's sake, Menekşe. Did a reservation of 30 people rise to 50? What? Did they give us a Michelin star? Are we tax champions? What happened? Tell me what it is, for God's sake. I'll just faint and collapse right here, so please tell me. Sabahattin told me that... we've been invited to Ali and Deniz's engagement party. Don't look at me like that. If you won't let them put a ring on your daughter's finger, someone else will do it for you. The ring. What ring? What engagement? She's my daughter. Why does Sabahattin care about this? He said "If there's no ring, I won't hand the restaurant over to you." He'll kick us out. He said "Come tonight and ask for the girl's hand in marriage." Chef, five Braves and two takeaways please. No way. I'd rather die. Over my dead body. - Here you go. - Thank you. Well, Adem... Let's get to the reason for our visit. These two young people saw each other and fell in love. I wish they hadn't. This is our duty as parents. - Right, my love? - Ow! Yes. Right. Let me make a speech. With God's command and the consent of the Prophet, they want your daughter for our son Ali. We want her. - Pardon, we want her. - We want her. - No! - Huh? What's wrong? It is not easy to get a girl from us. Deniz is the only daughter of this house. Is that man not giving me my biological daughter? I didn't expect this either. Thank you for coming and asking for her. But for all I know, this boy could be a thief or something. Mr. Sabahattin, why would he be a thief? - He's just living on his own... - Don't say that, Miss Menekşe. Offspring raised by different roosters will crow differently. There is a real father, and there is just a father. I don't get it. What do you mean by that? Who are you to question my fatherhood, sir? I mean, you... How can you say this in front of my son? How dare you? Your son is sitting there next to my perfect daughter. I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? What do you mean? Do you know what he's been through just to get here? To meet his father, to have a decent life... He put a lot of effort in that! Why would he want your slutty daughter? Get up, wife. It's up to him to give his daughter or not. Let her rot here. It's up to him to give his daughter. My son can easily find a decent girl. What are you doing, Adem? I don't know, I just got carried away. Sorry. Yes! Now that's what I'm looking for in a chicken restaurant owner. If you don't defend your son today, you won't defend your future daughter-in-law. If there's no unity in family, there won't be unity in the restaurant either. So you're saying that you're giving the girl to us? "For once and all, I do." you mean? I'm giving you both the girl and the restaurant. Mr. Sabahattin, really? - Get up, Adem, up! - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Uncle Sabahattin. - Mother. - My dear. - Let me kiss your hand, Dad. - No. Oh, Mr. Sabahattin! Oh, you! Let's get those rings on. Then we'll go out and have some fun. It's a double celebration! There's no need to go anywhere and have fun. We need to work tomorrow, and we have to open early. The customers will be queuing up. - This is easy peasy. - How is it easy? CHICKEN OF THE DAY - 20 PIECES SOLD OUT There we go. Aren't you cold? That's it. Put this on your door and it's done. "Chicken of the Day, 20 pieces, sold out." Melahat and I used to do that when the night was young. - Sabahattin! - Sabahattin! Sabahattin, the night was young for you, apparently. Why didn't you tell us if you knew about this? - What? - It's like we've been to war. We've been peeling potatoes and onions for days. Uncle Sabahattin, my father takes this job very seriously. I can't put it into words. I'm sure he can relax now that this sign is up. You can carry on with your night however you like. I'll take care of the restaurant. If anything happens, I'll call my father. Don't worry. Trust your son, please. Yes, we have to go. Let's go and have fun. But first, let's put on those rings. - Oh God! - Yes. - Here you go. - You're obsessed with rings! Come here, my dear. Come on then. - Congratulations, Deniz. - My dear. - They look so beautiful. - Best wishes! Congratulations to you both! - Come on, take some photos! - Take some photos! Adem, get in here. Bravo! Daddy! Müco! Relax! We own the restaurant now. I'm sorry. I can't just relax like you guys can. Did we come here to sit? Come on. We came here to distract Sabahattin. So let's take care of that and get back to work. You are so boring, Commissioner. Look at them. They are so happy! They look so good together. Menekşe, don't. Why? Don't they look good together? Yes, they look so good together. Just like you and me. The love of an innocent one and a criminal. And I'm the fake father here. How dare you call me a criminal? You should have been a judge instead of a commissioner. If it keeps up like this, neither we nor your daughter will stay. You will die alone. I'll be right back. I'm only dancing with your daughter because Sabahattin is here. You know me. So that he won't suspect anything. Bravo, Sabahattin! DON QUIXOTE MIGUEL DE CERVANTES You deserve this chance, Sancho. Never stop reading or dreaming. Commissioner. Guys, Salih talked to Cigan. We have a meeting place and time. Ali, what's the deal with Menekşe? - What? - What's the deal with Menekşe? It's a bit of a cliché, actually. Her family forced her to marry. Menekşe runs away and meets a guy. The guy tricks her and says that he will make her a singer. And she believes him. It's impossible for her to become a singer, so she starts singing at a club. On her first day there, a customer tries to approach her. So she took a fork and stabbed him in the balls. Dear God. How is this a cliché? He didn't die, fortunately, so she's out on parole. She went back to that club. She becomes a club girl again and stabs people with forks. Parole, bar, fork, balls... Her singing is as bad as her behavior. Dad! Smile! - Let's take a selfie. - Okay. Menekşe, what are you doing here? Are you working here too? Sorry, I don't know you, sir. You ruined my life. I'm in love with you! What are you talking about? - What's up with you, bastard? - It's fine, Adem. Tell me how much you want for her and back off. He's dead. Give me a minute, Menekşe. It's fine, Adem. What the fuck are you saying? What? Come here! Who the hell are you? Do you know who you're messing with? - Hello, Umut? - There's news about the gang. I recorded their chat. Come here immediately. Okay, we're coming. Come on, there's news about the gang. Let's go! - Come on, let's go. Hurry! - Deniz, Menekşe, come on! Back off! Run! - Sabahattin! - What is happening? - Come with us. - There's a lot of drunk people. Someone's trying to start a fight. CLOSED Did you save Menekşe by fighting those guys, sir? - He did. - Sure. Not everyone can use their head like him. He did it so quickly. You could use your head as a battering ram in police raids. He was beating the guys like this. My father would never let anyone lay a finger on his loved ones. Of course I wouldn't. Sir? - What is it? - Thank you for trusting us and for giving us another chance. Come over here. Boy... What are you saying, boy? Huh? You did a good job too. That information you told us was really vital, Sancho. - Father. - Yes? I've found something, I have some news. They all sang like canaries. Salih and Cigan will meet at a farmhouse, and they will be talking about the distribution network. This is all trivial talk. Never mind that. This farmhouse belongs to a businessman. His name is Veysel Vardarlı. Veysel Vardarlı. We have to record Cigan and Salih together. Once we know their distribution plans, we can go to the director in our uniforms and conduct that operation. Veysel, the guy they will meet at his house, what if he's involved in the distribution? I don't care whether he's involved or not. This has gotten serious. This is getting serious. We will begin our operation. You will pack your things right now. Don't upset your father. Go straight to Ankara. - But Dad... - There is no but. Please. That's it! I can't put you in any more danger. Okay, sure. I'm gonna leave then. Please. I'll go pack my stuff. That's right. And you guys, don't leave the restaurant. I can't put any of you at risk. I will go in there with Mücahit. This is a really great idea, sir. Progressive and pragmatic. There's just one question. How are we gonna get in that farmhouse? How can we get in there without revealing ourselves? That's the big mystery. It's no mystery, man. I got the plan and costumes. I'll take care of it. - Wait. - Okay. - What are they talking about? - Huh? - Deniz? - Go ahead, come on. I will be there too, Ali. Include me in your plan. I know everything, Ali. My father lied to me. He didn't tell me that he was suspended. In fact, you must have hired Menekşe and Umut to help my father. You tried to stay here by force to help your father. You wondered about the details of the operation. You searched for information about us, all for one reason. Because you didn't tell your father that you are a cop. Müco, stay in the yard and start waiting the tables. If they come, get them on tape. I will go there. Let me know if anything happens. Sir, I can't see much, and what I can see is really out of focus. If Cigan and Salih come here and I can't record them, this will be a real mystery. Enough of your mysteries! We've set our minds on it now. We can't give up until we find them. - Give me the tray. - Here. Trust me. Come on, work. I'm here in the yard. Did you order any chicken? Here you go. We have the best chicken. Congrats. Good choice. Would you like to try the chicken? I'm sure you've never tasted chicken like this. Where the hell are you, Deniz? Answer me. Oh, Deniz. Idiot. Deniz, where have you been? Deniz? - Adem, it's me. - Oh, shit. Why did you say Deniz? Hey, chicken. Hello, I'm a waitress from the catering company. Where is the bathroom? Thank you. Cigan is going to Turan's place. We're going there too. Why did you bring Deniz here? I really want to punch you in the face. - She's not here, I swear. - Where is she then? She must be at the restaurant. I came alone. You sound like you're lying. Salih's gang is here. They are coming. I'm a chicken. That's Deniz. That's her. No. - Can you bring our car? - Yes, sir. Hope we won't be late. - Dad, move! - Get out. - Move! - I said get out! Dad, Salih is going somewhere else. Sir, let's follow them or else we will lose them. What are you saying? How can we follow them? - What? - Sir... - They will hear us. - I don't care. Everybody can hear. You didn't listen to me and you've put my daughter in danger. Now you're giving me advice? She told me that she'd wait outside. Why would I put her in danger? Why are you talking? Get in that car or step aside. What are you saying? Do you really think you can track them? What are you doing here? What are you two doing here? - We... - Yes? You two? You shouldn't have done this, Ali. You should not have done this. You shouldn't have done this. I will... I'll, myself, personally put you in jail! - You scamming bast... - Enough! Can you stop? I didn't put Deniz in danger. She's a police officer. What did you say? You're a police officer? Nothing, Commissioner. Not a sound. Nothing. They've moved on. We can't even get their frequency. So we've lost them? What do you mean? We'll find another way. We only had one chance to catch them, but we lost it. It's over. If you hadn't told my dad that I was a police... - So it's my fault? - Yes. Both of you were selfish. None of this would have happened if you hadn't gone behind our backs. Is this mission over, Commissioner? Will you track down those men and keep those promises you made to us? Or will you just keep sitting here? Tell us what we're going to do! Nothing. The mission is over. My team consisted of... a con artist, his criminal friends, and my daughter, who lied to my face. This was bound to happen. Are we really criminals to you, Commissioner? After all this? This is what we are to you? A person's character cannot change as easily as their criminal record, Ali. You haven't changed since the first day I met you. You're a criminal whose only talent is to con people. Just like your father. That's why I'm done trying to be a hero. And done pretending to be a family. And I'm done with this mission. That's it. Don't, Commissioner. Don't be this harsh. You'll end up alone. Maybe that's what I need. To be alone. It's your decision. You need to choose between your father and being a police officer. We are suspended from here as well. I won't give up being a police officer, and I won't give up on my father. I'll keep tracking this gang. Okay, all right. That's enough. What's with you? Stop sulking and don't give up. Did we have somewhere to go or have a shop back then? Look, now we have a really good restaurant. And we have money too. We just need each other. Look, I know the commissioner. He will see the error of his ways and come back. We just need to wait it out. Mark my words. From now on, waiting is not an option for me, sis. I'm out. Even if everything went to plan, the commissioner would've ditched us. He was right. We were pretending to be a family. It was stupid of me to believe this all along. Ali! What do you mean you're out? You can't let people down after they put their faith in you. I didn't let them down. Your father did. Everyone is replaceable, Deniz. They will find another chef. And you... You will find another fiancé. Just like your father wants. Someone who's not a thief. An honest man. Well... anyone but me. Okay, let's hang out. Give me some of those. You didn't have to come after me. You're not my mother. I know, and I know that I could never be. But I could be your friend. Or I could be your big sister Menekşe. Umut, I don't want you to give up. Keep dreaming. Maybe you can take a distance learning course like me. Maybe become a police officer. I'll always be with you, no matter what you do. You can't escape. You're the one asking for trouble. I did it! I really did it! I hit it! I don't want to say it, sir, but I wish you hadn't been so harsh. We could've had their help on this mission. It was too much. If I just told them to go, they wouldn't have listened to me. - We all got carried away. - At being a family, right? They may think that I'm a bad person, but I just wanted them to be safe. So how do you know that Cigan and Veysel contacted each other? If Cigan and Salih are meeting at Veysel's house, either Veysel is laundering money via his own businesses... or he plays an important role in their distribution. Or both. How can us two masterminds get suspended? Seriously. We will discuss this as a family, and I'll get back to you. You can check my client, Veysel Vardarlı. In order to expand his Pizza Ways restaurant chain, he's had to take over a lot of shops. This is a really big opportunity for a small business like yours. I'm looking forward to hearing your positive response soon, Miss Menekşe. What's going on, Menekşe? I don't know, but that man is obsessed with taking over our restaurant. TURAN DAĞCI ATTORNEY Didn't you hear who his client is? Veysel Vardarlı. Isn't he the owner of that farmhouse you went to? Cigan, Salih, Veysel, Turan... They're all working together. So they're taking over these shops to launder money or use them for distribution? If I'm right, we've found them. We're back on our mission. - Mr. Cigan, can we talk? - Yes. Quiet! Veysel and Cigan are talking. The shipment will arrive at the main port tonight. Goods from a Colombian group. - Nice! Talk to Salih. - Man, stop it! Stop chewing so loud! We will go to the harbor before they arrive and ambush them. We will make our surprise payment. After we receive this shipment, no one will stand in our way. They are talking about goods, shipments, harbors! We'll call my dad and he can inform the director. And he will keep his promise. - There is no room for error, Müco. - Right! As soon as we catch Cigan and the gang in the act, we'll call the director. We'll catch the whole gang, and we will keep our promises. I'll be at your side, girl, until we catch those dealers. Do you have a plan? - Yes. - Well? We will find their restaurants and wander around them like customers. We'll try to find some clues there. By the way, where is Ali? DENIZ Hello, Dad? I've made my decision. Talk to the mediator. I have the money. I'm coming, even as a fugitive. You're my only family. Nobody's here either. I need to find some new clues. Deniz, I don't want to burst your bubble but I'm really tired, so let's go. - Come on. - We'll take our food with us. Will you? Aren't they from that gang? I'll just go and take a look. Be careful, girl. PIZZA SAUCE - Did you send the delivery guy? - He's just left. Good job. - Continue packaging that. - Okay. - What are you doing here? - Calm down. - Get on your knees. - Calm down! - On your knees. - No problem. Just calm down! - Drop your guns! - Calm down. - Drop your guns! - Drop your guns. Do as I say. There's nothing. See? - Get in there! - What the hell? Get in there! Come on! This woman and kid already have a criminal record. This girl just graduated from the police academy. Her father is a suspended commissioner, Adem Haberdar. They've been monitoring you for days. How did you not notice this? Boss, we checked them out. They seemed like a normal family. We didn't want to draw too much attention. Criminals and cops. There's something fishy going on here. Make a video call to the girl's father. Distract him a little. Then take them to that warehouse at the port. We'll kill them after our delivery. Including her dad. Do it. Your phone, sir. NO CALLER ID Who's calling me? - This is Salih. - Salih. - Salih! - We have your family, chicken man. - You bastard! - Dad! Menekşe! My girl! If you want to see them again, be smart and stay where you are. If you call your police friends and try to be a hero, you'll never see them again. You bastard! Salih! If you dare hurt them, I will kill you. I swea... How will I find them? God grant me patience. We'll find them via Ali. Hello, Hasan. Hello, Ali. - Did you get the money? - Yes, I have it. Let me just take this call. Hello? Deniz. I'm heading to the port. Be careful. Kill that troublemaker. Yes, boss. Shut the fuck up! I told you to shut the fuck up! If you keep doing that, I will silence you. Police! Drop it! - Okay! Gimme a second. - Drop it! - Okay! - Ali! Remain calm. Easy. Drop your guns! Drop 'em! Untie everyone. What? You don't want to be untied? What's wrong? Ali! Were you trying to kill me? Well? It's empty. You fucking... Here. Take the money and let us go. Take it! Are those real? Is that real money? Ali, are you okay? Ali! Ali! Ali, wake up! Ali! Ali, are you okay? Are you okay? Wake up. Ali, are you okay? Why the hell did you bring all the change Ali? These guys are mafia. They would have killed you. I'd die without you anyway, Deniz. - What? - Take this. Keep it hidden. I tricked myself into thinking that my father loves me. Why would someone leave his family? Why wouldn't he come back? But when I was alone, I realized that I'm not alone among the people loving me. Hey, shut up! Okay, Kara, it's fine. If I can't be with you, then I don't care whether I'm alive or dead. What are you doing? That's enough. I guess you don't understand the meaning of "shut the fuck up." So let me speak in a language you will understand. Hey, stop right there! Come here and hit me! - Adem. - People love you. And it isn't even over yet. Who are you? - Who are you? - My father. Attack them! Attack! - I will kill you. - Move, move! Deniz! Müco, leave him. My dear Deniz. - What was that, Deniz? - Menekşe. - Menekşe. - What was that? - Oh God, I can't believe this. - That's it. - Come on, let's go. - Come on. Everyone to their places. Go around the port. Cigan is here. We're waiting for the other gang. Cigan will make the delivery here? Sir, if Cigan is here too, how will we sneak in? - Where is Onur. Why didn't he come? - Didn't you text Onur? I definitely did. Look. See for yourself. Look. - You didn't hit the send button. - You're right, I didn't. It isn't sending. I don't have a signal. Is there a signal jammer in here? A signal jammer. Of course. Then we will go to plan B. - We have a plan B? - Of course we do. Do you see those men over there? - Yes, sir, I saw them. - Do you see the signal jammer? Once that has been disabled, we can contact the police station. And those guns we got from the storage room? Don't use them until I say so, okay? - Let's see. - Okay, sir. Our careers took a strange turn. We were cops, then restaurant owners. And now we are drug dealers. It went downhill so fast. These men will stick their guns in us, and you still think this is funny? Let's do this. Good luck. There's a lot of people. I think they sent the goods without an intermediary this time. - I think they are talking about us. - Let them talk. It's no problem. Are you Colombian? Do you speak Turkish? - Stop it. - I'm in control. - Okay! - Listen. Okay, stop it! We're from Konya, we speak Turkish. - What did he say? - We don't look like we're from Konya. I don't know. I've said it, so keep pretending to be from Konya. Well? Did we come here to chat or are we gonna do business? Where's the money? - Where's the money? - No need to exaggerate. Show us the goods first. - He wants to see the goods. - Bring the goods then. - Where are they? - Bring the goods we brought this way. - Oh, I'll bring the goods. - Okay. - Another truck's just arrived. - What's going on? - Sir. - Who the hell is "Miraç Bey"? - This is the main delivery. - What are you saying? We are so unlucky! MIRAÇ BEY - Who are you? - What do you mean? We came for our delivery. The goods are in the truck. Then who the hell are you? I told you, we're from Konya. Stop or I'll shoot you. - Should I pull my gun, sir? - Tell your men to put the guns down. - For protection. - Give me my money. Okay, no need to get stress out. As for our agreement... Oh, my fucking God. I'll call the shots here. They placed a spy. Bastard. - Okay, put your guns down. - Collect all of them. Collect them all. We'll go to plan C. What? - Plan C. Just run away slowly. - Oh, that. - Slowly. Don't let them notice you. - We can all relax now. Our hands are empty. We won't harm anyone, okay? - We should just run. - No, move slowly. Get theirs. - He's coming. - Give us your guns. Here. You too. Oh, God. They shot him. They killed him. They've all perished. Let's get back to you. You have ten seconds to tell me who you really are. The clock's ticking. Adem Haberdar, Commissioner. Cigan, you are surrounded. You and your men should surrender. You have nowhere to run. I don't know, Salih. Which one should we surrender to? To a suspended commissioner? Or to two idiots in costume who don't even have guns? We aren't two idiots. We are six idiots. We're not idiots, you fool. We are restaurant owners. We're not idiots. We are a family of six with a chicken restaurant. You'll see soon. Run! Run! - He destroyed the signal jammer! - Text Onur, right now. Stop that! I told you to surrender, Cigan. Kill them all! Attack! Did you learn about the people who are helping Adem? You know Mücahit. His operations are successful, and he is from Edirne, Kırkpınar. He won many medals during his time on the Youth National Team. Müco. - What is this? - Our national sport, man. - What about the others? - Umut Temizer. Went to juvenile hall for pickpocketing. We always catch him, but he always escapes somehow. Come here. He's here. Well done, bro. Ali Öz, Adem's informant. He's got an impressive record as a con artist. He's really good at it. Really. Come. Deniz Haberdar. Whose fiancé are you beating up? Adem's daughter. She's just graduated from the police academy. - She's a very skilled fighter. - Deniz! Deniz, behind you! I will never lie to you. I swear to you, Deniz. Menekşe Sönmezoğlu. She is known as "Çatal Karam" in nightclubs. Mother! Son! Sir, if you don't mind my asking, why do they call Adem "The Battering Ram"? He has a platinum scalp. - Adem received many blows to his head. - Adem. He's had many operations, but he survived and kept working. They successfully tracked down the gang by pretending to be a family. This isn't something that is easily done. They became a family, a large family. Now I understand those hard adventures and all the mistakes we've made. Good and bad aren't permanent. And whatever our fate may be, fortune favors the brave. They are the Don Quixotes, the heroes of my story. My family. Stop chasing me, chicken man! - Dad! - Get down! - Commissioner! - Get down! If you come after me again, I will kill you and your family. - Sir! - Did you hear me? Commissioner! Cigan! Dad! - Dad! - Dad! - Dad! - Adem! Commissioner! - Commissioner! - Dad! - Commissioner! - Adem! - Look at me, Dad! - Commissioner! Look at me. Commissioner! We are here to commend Commissioner Adem and his family, who heroically helped him bring down this drug network. Hello, Brave Chicken. Chicken never tasted this good. Yes? Six Brave Chickens? We have your address. I'll send them over immediately. Umut, come here and help your brother Mücahit. - I can't keep up with these orders! - Just a minute. - This is the suspect. - I'm coming. That's Burhan. - Who's this? - İlhan. - Who's this? - İlhan. You say the name "İlhan" so beautifully. Ali, we have an order for six Brave Chickens. - Get in the kitchen, please. - Okay, Dad. - Who is he? - Daughter, go and help him. Okay. Müco, what are they talking about? Listen to them carefully. - Are you recording everything? - They are talking nonsense now. They're talking about relationships. Where will we conduct this new operation? Who's it on and how will we do it? They're all a mystery to me. 3379 to police station. 3370 speaking. We are ready for a new mission. BRAVE CHICKEN RESTAURANT CLOSED
