[WIND WHISTLING] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] [MAN] Watch out. [MAN] Sara, keep it tight. [MAN] Six-two-seven... [INDISTINCT] [SHUTTER CLICKING] [SHOUTING] [GUNFIRE] Move it! On your right. Go, go, go! Move. Move! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Keep going! Push forward to the wall. Push forward to the wall. Got four guys with AKs, RPGs in the tree line. - [SHOUTING] - Where's that gun? Hey! Trying to get your ass shot off? Get in there and stay down! [WOMAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [BABY CRIES] [WOMAN CONTINUES SPEAKING] [CLICK, BEEPING] [SHARP INHALE] You're staring at me. Can't help it. Oh, it's freezing out here. [EXHALES] What are you doing? I told Blake I'd get the champagne. - Oh, no. Let her get it. - [LAUGHS] - Come back to bed. - It's 3:00 in the afternoon. And in an hour from now, it's gonna be 4:00 in the afternoon. I know... I told her I'd do it, though. All right. Let me get my coat. I'm gonna come with you. No, no, no, no. I got it. I'd rather do it myself. OK. OK, sure. [CHUCKLES] When are you gonna let me turn this into an engagement ring? You do not ever give up. No, not when I want something. I thought we agreed on this, huh? Whatever happens, happens. Oh, God. - It's already happened. - [SIGHS] Stop. [BOTH LAUGH] You sure you don't want me to come? No, I'm good. Hold down the fort. Will do. [CAT MEOWS] Hey, hey. [ELEVATOR DINGS] - Oh, hello, Sara. - Hi, Antonio. Any big plans for tonight? Yep, I'm gonna work late. New Year's Eve's for amateurs. [BOTH LAUGH] - Can I grab you a cab? - No, no, I'm good. I'm just going to the store. - Be safe, young lady. - Thank you. [MAN] Hey, look out. - [GASPS] - What are you, blind? - Yeah. I am. - Hey, you OK? I saw the whole thing. What an asshole. Nothing new. The city's full of 'em. [CHUCKLES] Here, um, let me help you. No, no. I got it. Hang on. Thank you. It's actually better if I do it myself. My light saber. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Oops. Sometimes I get cocky, and I forget that I need it. Hey, I can walk you where you're going. No, I know where I'm going. Thanks, though. - You sure? It takes no trouble. - Yeah. Happy New Year. Yeah, you too. You... you got the light. - OK. Thank you. - You watch out for assholes. I will. [CANE TAPPING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [CHILDREN JUMPING ROPE] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] [BASKETBALL BOUNCING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [AUTOMATED VOICE] Call from Blake. - Hey, Blake. - Hey, where are you? Out... buying champagne. [BLAKE] Great. Are you on your own? Yes, I'm on my own. All by my lonesome. [BLAKE] Good, I'm glad you're getting out. You spend way too much time hiding out in that penthouse with Ryan. Oh, my God. What's wrong with hiding out? Don't make me feel guilty for finding a guy I like. Stop busting my chops. [LAUGHS] I'm your sister. It's my job. You and Danny gonna come over and ring in the New Year with us? Danny had to pull a double, and he's not even home yet. So he's gonna have to sleep for a couple hours. Please try and make it. [BLAKE] We will. It's gonna be last minute, OK? - I love you. - All right. Love you, too. [ANTONIO] Sara... How'd it go out there today? I didn't walk into any telephone poles, so... That's good. [ANTONIO] Have yourself a good evening, OK? [SARA] Thank you. You, too. Ryan? It's the lady with the liquor. You here? Ryan? Ryan? Ryan? Ryan? - [CAT MEOWS] - Good girl. [CAT PURRS] Good girl. [CAT CRIES] You can't be hungry, Shadow. I just fed you. [CAT MEOWING] [GASPS] [GASPING, PANTING] Oh my... Ryan. Ryan? Oh, my God. Ryan? Oh, my... Ryan. Baby? Ryan. [SOBS] Help! Ryan! [SCREAMS] Oh, God. Who's there? [SARA] Who's there? What do you want? - What do you want... - [CLATTERING] Who's there? What do you want? - Say something. [GASPS] - [LOUD THUD] [MAN] Open the door. Open the door, Sara. Yeah, I know your name. I've been watching you for days. Start listening. [COMPUTER] Armadillo is ready. - Start menu. - [COMPUTER] Menu. Open the goddamn door! [GRUNTS] Open email. [COMPUTER] Read email? Write email. - [COMPUTER] Please repeat. - Write email to Blake. - [COMPUTER] Email to Blake. - Call the police a man is... [SARA SCREAMS] [MAN GRUNTS] - [SARA WHIMPERS] - Look what you made me do. [SARA BREATHING HEAVILY] - Hey. - Hey. It's official. I hate New Year's Eve. Rough one, huh? I'm gonna go lie down for a couple years. OK. Remember, Sara wants us to be there before midnight to watch the fireworks from Ryan's penthouse. - [SIGHS] - What? Something not right about that guy. - Danny, what did you do? - I ran a check on him. You did what? He said he was living in Philly before Brooklyn, right? According to DMV records, he was in Miami the last seven years. No, I think he said he was born in Philly. He was born in Dade County, Florida. So, we'll ask him and find out. Lots of people make up stories about themselves. I know. I arrest them all the time. - [CLATTERING] - [GRUNTING] [CLATTERING CONTINUES] Hmm. What happened to this camera? I dropped it. - [LOUD THUD] - Like that? [WATER RUNNING] You're a mess... I'm gonna clean you up. Hold still now. You have an awesome body. It feels good, huh? - Nice and cool. - Thanks. Did Ryan ever do this for you? It wouldn't be the first time me and Ryan shared the same... - Get your hands off me! - [MAN] Huh? - What? - I'm sorry. - [BREATHING HEAVILY] - You OK now? Yeah, just, these are really tight. Are you gonna help me, Sara? Yeah. Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So, what did Ryan tell you about himself? - How did he make his money? - He's an investor. Ryan wasn't an investor. Ryan was a goddamn thief. He stole something that belongs to me and I'm here to get it back. - Where is it? - What? I don't know what you're talking about. I wonder if I believe that. I would tell you if I knew. Where's my money, Sara? I don't want to hurt you. And I will. I'll hurt you bad. What's it gonna be, huh? [GASPING BREATHS] An ear? Both ears? An eye? 'Cause it doesn't do you any good. Tell me. Tell me. - Tell me! - [phone ringing What? I'm so cold. I'm really cold. Please... Can I put some clothes on? [MAN] Yeah, just get your ass... Hey! Hollander. Yeah, I was just gonna call you. Yeah, it didn't exactly go down the way we planned it. Son of a bitch came at me, I had to kill him. There wasn't time. You know how fast he is. Only this time, I was faster. I know I kinda screwed up, OK? But I got the girl, and I'll get the truth if I have to carve it out of her. You don't have to do that Hollander, I got this covered. I got this under control. Yeah. OK, OK. - [RAGGED BREATHING] - God damn it! You know what this is? This is not good, Sara. Not good for you, not good for me. Listen to me. Do you want to die today, Sara? - No. No. - Is that what you want? Then you tell me where Ryan hid it, and maybe we both get out of this... alive. - You want me to help you? - [MAN] Yes. - OK. I know where it is. - Good. Now you're being smart. Come on, where the... [GASPING] [PANTING] [SHOUTS] [GASPS] [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] Sara. You hurt me. I think it's gonna leave a scar. - [GASPING] - [WOMAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] - Oh, God. Oh, God... - [WOMAN SPEAKING] - [MAN] Sara, get down! - [MAN 2] Step back! Step back! [MAN 2] Step back! [ANTONIO] Somebody down here? Antonio? Antonio? - Who's that? - It's Sara. There's a man down here! He killed Ryan! - Sara? - He killed Ryan. Get help! Get help! Call the police! Are you hurt? Are you all right, Sara? Please go back! Get the police! - It's OK. - No, it's not OK. I'm not leaving you alone. [SARA] No! Go back! Stay right where you are! Get help! - I'm not leaving you, Sara. - [MAN GRUNTS] [BLADE SLICES] Antonio? Antonio! Antonio can't hear you anymore. [GASPS] Help me, please! Help me! Can somebody help me? [SCREAMS] Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God! Oh, God! Oh, God. [HORN HONKING] Please help. Help... Please. Help... Is somebody there? Please, I need help. - [WOMAN] Are you OK? - There's a man. He's coming after me. [MAN] Can I help? - [SARA] Please. Please, yes. - Can I help? Please... My name's Robert Shannon, I'm a New York City prosecutor. - Oh, God. Please... - I understand, I understand... - I need your help. - We're gonna get you somewhere safe, OK? - There's a man. - OK. I got it. You can go. - Thank you. - [BOY] Let's go. He's some kind of cop. OK, listen. First thing we're gonna do... We're gonna get you a safe place, OK? - Please we have to... - Put this on. Everything's OK. Are you all right? - OK, what's your name? - Sara... - OK, Sara. - Sara Frost. [MAN] You're doing good. Now, Sara. I'm gonna have to call 911, and they're gonna ask me what happened. Can you tell me? A man broke into my apartment. My boyfriend's apartment. He killed my boyfriend. Where's the apartment? 260 Blackwood. Penthouse North. I'm going to have to call this in. Just a second. OK? Hi. Yeah. This is ADA Robert Shea. I'm with a young woman who is a victim of an assault. Her name is Sara Frost. Uh-huh. Yeah, apparently there's a homicide involved as well... at 260 Blackwood. Penthouse North... Just a second. It's the boyfriend. Yeah. OK. Oh, great. OK, thanks. Great, I got it. Thank you very much. OK. There's a unit. It's a block away. The police are gonna meet us at the building, OK? - Thank you. - OK. - There we are. - Are the police here, yet? They'll be here any second. May I use your phone to call my sister, please? Sure. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Is that them? - Sara. - It's him. - It's him. - I know. [SARA WHIMPERS] [PANTING] Pretty interesting day, Chad. Pretty interesting. Let's see, first, you killed Ryan... before we had a chance to get any information out of him. And then you let a 118-pound blind girl make a fool out of you. That's not how it happened. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how it happened. That's exactly how it happened, Chad. Just like that. Let's face it. You're kind of a fuck-up. Aren't you? You're also a mess. Go clean yourself up. Go ahead. Go on. [DOOR CLOSES] Look, so you know... the only thing, honestly, the only thing standing between you and that psychopath in there is me. That's it. OK? Wow. Ryan, huh? Yeah, it's kind of like your own little fortress. Just you and Ryan up here where nobody can touch you. [SIGHS] How was it gonna last? - I was always gonna find you. - Find me? Well... Ryan... And whoever else was unlucky enough to be with him. What do you want? What are you gonna do? What am I gonna do? I don't know. I guess whatever it takes. That's what I'm gonna do. Whatever it takes. Wow. You know, I know you can't see this... but this view. I mean... This view is drop dead. Hey, did you ever wonder how a young guy like Ryan could ever even afford a place like this? He had money. Yeah, he had money. Did he ever say anything about Miami? Miami? Uh-huh. Big city. Florida. He used to live there. Anything else? He said he got involved with some very bad people down there. Really? Yeah... [CAT MEOWS] Hey. Oh, who's this? Oh, what's the name of your cat? Shadow. Shadow, aren't you a pretty girl? [CAT PURRS] I really didn't figure Ryan as a cat guy. What is wrong with you? Ryan is dead. That animal in the next room murdered him. You think you knew Ryan. Let me ask you something... If Ryan was such a choir boy, what was he doing in business with the likes of Chad and me? It's here. Somewhere. Ryan would never let it get out of his reach. He'd keep it close by. You know where it is. Don't you think I would have told that psychopath anything I knew once he put his hands on me. Chad likes the rough stuff. Ryan, too, actually... Was that it? Was that your thing? I'm not judging... You don't know anything about me. See, actually, I do. Google. "Sara Frost, promising young photo-journalist embedded with US troops in Afghanistan. Wow. Blah, blah, blah... suicide bomber... Oh, boy. Here we go. Permanent blindness." Permanent blindness. Permanent. What is that like? Everything you loved. Everything. Gone in a flash of light. Are you one of those people who thinks, whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger? Is that what you think? I'd put a bullet through my head. - Where is it, Sara? - [FOOTSTEPS] Ryan hid it good, Hollander. But I know it's here. Of course it's here, Chad. And if you hadn't killed him, we would have had it by now. [CHAD] Just give me five minutes with her, I'll get the truth. What if you lose control, like you did with Ryan? - Won't happen. - What if you kill her? [CHAD] I won't. [HOLLANDER] OK, but do not kill her. I mean it, Chad. - No, don't... - Don't what? Don't leave me alone with him. Too late, Sara. I can't help you. - [CHAD GRUNTS] - [SARA GASPS] - [BLADE OPENS] - [CHAD] I can't kill you, but let's see how close I can get. Chad, hold it. Stop. What's wrong with this picture? - What are you talking about? - Quiet, Chad. Your knuckles are dragging. I'll tell you what's wrong with this picture. This picture... Everything else in this pretentious apartment is generic. Soulless, like Ryan. Everything... but this photograph. It's one of yours, isn't it, Sara? Yeah. Yeah, Ryan blew it up and framed it for you, right? It's haunting. Really disturbing. It's beautiful. Take it down. - Why? - Because I told you to. Give me your blade. Give me your knife. You have a very unhealthy attachment to this knife. Sweet. There's got to be... 200, 300 grand here. What? So you got what you came for. Will you go now? Sure, soon as Chad bags the cash. Well, that wasn't so bad. That worked out for everybody. Except for Ryan. Was it worth it? Killing him... Tell you the truth. I'm gonna miss old Ryan. He was a good investment. You talk about him like he was some sort of object, some thing. Sara, Ryan betrayed you and me. I know what you're thinking. If I'd loved that guy long enough and hard enough, I could change him. Never gonna happen. Ryan was scum. You couldn't see him for what he really was. You want me to do her? - No, I don't want you to do her. - She knows too much. - What does she know? - She knows some voices... fake names. That's all. Hey, Chad, Not everything has to end up in blood, all right? Go wait for me at the door. Some other time then, Sara. Listen, I know this is tough on you. You're a whole lot stronger than you know. Now, I don't want you to leave the apartment, or call anybody for an hour, OK? An hour. Yeah, now I get it. Now I see what Ryan saw in you. [CLICKS TONGUE] [DOOR SLAMS] [RAGGED BREATHING] [SHRIEKS] How'd you know? I smelled you. She didn't lead us to shit. Shut up, Chad. We're close. Put that down, Sara. You're gonna hurt yourself. You stay away from me. You got your money, you got what you wanted. We're not here for the money, Sara. - The money's chickenshit. - Then what, what do you want? Why won't you leave me alone? Where did Ryan say he got this diamond? He was buying diamonds. He said they were investments. - Investments my ass. - Where are the others? - The others? - Yeah, I want my other twenty-nine clear, perfect diamonds. $20 million worth stolen in Miami. Are you saying Ryan stole 'em? Yeah, that's right and then double-crossed us. - Where are my diamonds? - I can't help. - [YELPS] - Can't or won't? Which is it, Sara? - Can't or won't? - [CHOKING] [COUGHS] Not the edge. We need her. - [COUGHING] - [CAT MEOWS] Hey, Shadow. Look here. Look who came to visit. Hiya. Do you hear that? You hear that purring, like a little racing motor. Please, put her down. Huh? Oh, it's OK. I'm a cat lover. I love cats, and cats love me. - [SHADOW MEOWS] - What are you doing? What do you mean? I'm just over here at the edge of the terrace. Just, once again, admiring this amazing view. - What are we 14, 15 stories up? - [SHADOW MEOWS] Careful, careful, careful, careful. Ooh, that was close. - Please. - Please, what? - Whatever you're thinking. - What am I thinking? It's an innocent animal. Sara, are you trying to put some ideas in my head? - Do you actually think I'm capable of... - No, I just... - I told you. I'm a cat lover. I love... - I know. Oh, great. You're upsetting Shadow. - For God's sake... - Shadow's upset now. Where are they? The diamonds. - I don't know. Please don't. - Yeah, you do. - Tell me where the diamonds are. - I don't know. Sara, just tell me where the diamonds are. I don't know. [SIGHS] OK. [CAT CRIES] - [SCREAMS] - Wrong answer. I wonder if she landed on her feet. - [GRUNTING] - That was fucked up. - What did you say? - That was fucked up. What did that cat ever do to you? Gee, Chad. When did you join PETA? I'm just saying... Yeah, you know Ryan may have been a disloyal dog, but at least he knew when to keep his mouth shut. - Yeah, well, Ryan's dead. - You challenging me, Chad? I'm just saying, you want answers, you don't go throwing cats around. You know, maybe when you killed Ryan, something happened to your brain. - Why don't you wait downstairs? - What? Leave you up here alone to find the diamonds? Why... I mean, do you think I'd sell you out? I don't know. Would you? Gee. Well, Chad if you don't trust me... You looking for this? - [CHAD SCREAMS] - [HOLLANDER GRUNTS] I'm deeply hurt that you don't trust me. - [CHAD] I trust you. - [HOLLANDER] What's that? - I trust you. - Yeah, you're just saying you trust me, but do you really trust me, Chad? I really trust you. Whew. For a second there, I thought maybe you didn't trust me. Here's your knife. [RADIO CHATTER] I got somebody on the roof down there. Rescue me, please. Please save me. [SARA GASPS] I'll give you one last chance. Wave. Wave. Yeah, just two people decided to start the party a little early. OK. Huh? Good. 'Cause we're gonna play a game called, "follow the cat." - [SARA SHOUTS] - It's a long way down there, Sara. Ryan has a safe. Show me. [CROWD CHEERING] [TELEVISION PLAYING] [EXHALES] Hey, honey. Um, you're not thinking of going to Sara's like that, are you? I'm not going at all. I thought we agreed. You said we'd see how I feel. Well, I feel like not going. Danny, it's 10 blocks. Listen, your pregnant wife and your unborn son are gonna go and visit her sister. You can come, or you can stay here and drink your beer and scratch your balls. [ELECTRIC SAW BUZZING] [SAWING CONTINUING] Drink this. Why doesn't he just kill me? Maybe I stopped him. You're terrified of him. - You're his lap dog. - I can't lie to him. You don't get it, do you? You have no idea what he's gonna do to you. - To me? - Do the math. $20 million divided by two. Why would Hollander cut you in when he could take it all for himself? Oh... You're way ahead of me, aren't you? I knew you were smart. You're gonna kill him first, aren't you? Drink. Help me, Chad, and I will help you. Really? And then what will you do? Whatever you want. Kill him. [SAWING CONTINUES] We gotta talk. Come on. That Ryan... got some sense of humor... for a dead guy. Diamonds weren't in the safe, I'm guessing. Yeah, I have a feeling you knew that. Which means... you're my only living link to those rocks, Sara. Where's Chad? Did you kill him already? I put him outside. Give us a chance to... be alone. He's working up the nerve to kill you, you know? Yeah, I was thinking about it. You may have even helped him a little bit. You know what, Sara? Behind that very pretty face, and those soft green eyes, you're not all that innocent, are you? Let's you and I make a deal. I tell you where the diamonds are, and you let me live. And as a kicker... I let you keep this. If you're anything like me, you'll cash it in. I am nothing like you. You kill people. Well, yeah. I mean... The world's a slaughterhouse, full of pigs just too stupid to see when the axe comes down. Take the offer. You're making a really big mistake, Sara. You know, I can hear something in your voice that wasn't there before. Really? What's that? Desperation. [PANTING, GRUNTING] [HOLLANDER] Comfortable? Good. Hold her shoulders down. [WHIMPERS] - [GRUNTING] - You know how this works? Thirsty? [GASPING] - [COUGHING] - You're not strong enough for this, Sara, nobody is. Why don't you just tell me what I need to know? Go to hell. [COUGHING] Where are they? The diamonds... [COUGHING, CHOKING] - Where are my diamonds? - [COUGHS] [BUZZER SOUNDS] [BLAKE ON INTERCOM] Hey, it's us. [SARA COUGHS] [BLAKE] A very pregnant lady is downstairs. - We're right outside the building, - That's my sister. So put some clothes on. I'm coming up. Please let me call her back. I can stop them. - You OK? - Mm-hmm. I don't trust her. You know what that is. I won't even blink before I kill them. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] - Their lives for the diamonds. - Yes. - Oh. - Hon, you all right? - [DOORBELL RINGS] - You want that baby to be born, don't you, Sara? - [BLAKE] Hello. - OK. Hold on. [BLAKE] Hey, Sara. Sorry. It's not a good time to come here right now. - Why not? - I should have called. What's going on? We're in the middle of a fight. - A fight. - He didn't hit you, did he? - No. No, Danny. - I swear, if he laid a hand on you... - Where is he? - He didn't lay a hand on me, OK? We just need to be alone so we can work it out, OK? Well, you don't expect us to leave? It's almost midnight. We want to be here with you. Blake, please. Sara, what's going on? We're just fighting. - Where's Ryan? - Ryan, we need to talk, man. [DANNY] Right now, Ryan. I need to see your face. [SARA] No, listen. This is just between us. We're here waiting, we're in it and we're not leaving. Please, just leave. No, Sara, look we're not gonna... - Honey? You OK? - [BLAKE WINCING] - Blake? - [BLAKE] Oh, no. - Blake... - Oh, shit. I think... Oh... Oh, shit. Sara, let us in and call 911. Blake needs to lie down. No. - Sara, let us in. - No, I can't. - For God sake's, Sara. - I can't, Danny. Stop. Stop! No. OK, Danny. Stop. - Honey, you need to lie down. - I know. Oh, shit. [BLAKE] All I need to do is get to a hospital. OK, I'm not having this baby right here. - OK. We'll get a cab. - I'll be there soon. University Hospital. OK. I'll see you soon. Looks like you're gonna be an aunt. - What are you doing? - I'm looking for a drink. See if Ryan has any decent scotch. With ice. Lots of ice. All right. We kept our part of the bargain. Where are they, Sara? Ryan never told me. - What? - But I think I know where they are. Oh, what, you think? What is this, huh? Hey, which part of make me a drink don't you understand? - Where? - The terrace. The terrace. It was one night last summer. I woke up. It was about 2:00 in the morning. Ryan wasn't in bed, but I heard him making some noise out here. When I came out, I sensed something wasn't right. He said he couldn't sleep, and that I should go back to bed. But I can still... I can still hear him. When he came to bed, I could smell dirt on his hands, and I think... I think he was hiding something in the pots. Must be a hundred pots out here. Took a lot of time, didn't it, Sara? Take... Is that the idea? Huh? Kind of... - Run out the clock? - [SHRIEKS] Think somebody's gonna come save you, something like that? What do you think I was gonna fucking quit? Did you think I was gonna quit and go home? Did you really think I was gonna quit... I'll tell you the truth... Move over. Move over here. Any luck? Luck? Finding the diamonds... Not yet, no. Here, here's your drink. Where's my ice? The ice is melted. What about my other ice? You know the kind you get at Tiffany's? Chad. I know. You were just going to tell me... - You wanted to surprise me. - [GROANS] [GASPING] The diamonds? We both knew this day was gonna come, Chad. One of us had to go. It was always gonna be you, Chad. [SPUTTERS] I wish you could see these, Sara. They're beautiful... [HOLLANDER GROANS] [GROANS] [BOTH SCREAM] Oh! - [HOLLANDER GRUNTS] - [SCREAMS] [PANTING] - Tell me, did you know the whole time? - I'm not telling you. Were you playing me? Were you just playing me? [KNIFE BLADE OPENS] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [MOANS] Sara? [GUNSHOT] You think I can't hear you? You think I don't know where you are? Come on, Hollander, talk. I know you like to talk. Cat got your tongue? [WOMAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING] [SHOUTS] That was a hit, wasn't it? All right, Hollander. Let's play. Are you watching? Keep your eye on the diamond. What do you say, should we go for number two? Hey... Speak up, I can't hear you. Three. Should I just let 'em all go? Don't drop them. [SARA GROANS] I won't. [YELLS] [SHOUTS] [BREATHING DEEPLY] [PURRING] [MEOWS]
