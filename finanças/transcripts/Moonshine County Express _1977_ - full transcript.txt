You better make a run into Springfield tomorrow sick engine or not. - Yes sir mister Hammer, wish we could get old JB to drive to drive for us though. - Nah, we don't butter the bread thick enough for JB Johnson. (engine rumbling) (cheering) (cheering) - What'll this thing do? - What won't it do? Quart mile at nines over a hundred and sixty. (cheering) With doubt that's how we're going to nationals with this one. - Where the hell did you get the money for this JB? - Gabe, I owe it all to you. A couple of weeks ago I was looking everywhere for you to buy you a drink a whiskey, I even looked under this wet old smiley rock and there in a tin can was all that money. - You running shine again for somebody ain't you JB? - Now Gabe you know I wouldn't mess around running shine again.

(gun shots) (growling) (gun shots) (gun shots) (country music) - You guys shake a leg, let's got out of here. (dramatic music) (explosions) (dog whining) (morose music) - So I know you'll find a place for him lord and forgive his sins and may his girls find forgiveness in their hearts for those strangers that took their daddy away. And so watch over these innocent children we pray in the name of the father and the son, amen. - Thanks for coming preach Akin. - Dorothy it was a real shock, terrible thing. Must have been hijackers from out of the county I'd guess. - my sentiments exactly. - Somebody step in something? - People are curious about what your gonna do Dorothy, what your plans are and all? - Ain't gonna do nothing. - You're not gonna stay on the farm? - It's where we were born, it's our home. - Well I know but I just can't see you making a living out of that old stony land. - Well don't you worry about it, cause we'll make out just fine. - If you girls decide to move you can call on me. Just anything I can do, anything at all. - This is the last of paps whiskey. I'm afraid it's all I got to pay you with. - Well Dorothy I'll think of your old daddy with every sip I taste. Now you think about what I told you. (bangs) (engine rumbles) - [Dorothy] I bet he empties that bottle before he rounds the first bend. - Oh man I sure hope you girls ain't planning to go back in business. - And if we decide we want to? - Don't let me catch you at it. - Mind the grease. - I have a job to do you know. - Then put Jack Starkey in jail. - Have you got any proof? - Proof? We just finished burying it. - Starkey was in Springfield that whole day, now I checked up on him. - Sure, of course he was Larkin. - He don't do his own killings. - Look there are a lot of people didn't like your daddy, Dotty I'm sorry but that's the truth. I'm gonna find out who did it and I'm gonna take care of 'em legal. That's a promise. - Well if you don't we'll take care of it the Hammer way. And that's a promise. (country music) - Sissy. How much money do we have left? - About 100 dollars in the bank is all. - That's just great. - But we're not moving off the farm. We're not going to work for Jack Starkey and we're not kissing anybodies rear end in this world. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna borrow some money. Somewhere. And we're gonna put that still back together. - Maybe Mr. Green wants to give us some money? - Lawyer Green? - Yeah he called this morning. I forgot. - That's okay, what did he want? - He said to come in and see him as soon as we could. - Figure that one out, now that's a weird old guy, what do you suppose he's up to? - I don't know, but let's go to town and find out. (country music) - Say what are you lovelies in town without a he man to protect ya? - You know what, we'll hire him. - How about letting me take you to the fireman's ball Saturday night? Hi there Sissy, you're looking more gorgeous everyday girl. - Straight ahead sister. - Hey Dotty wanna see my trophy? - I wouldn't wanna see what every girl in Humphry seen. - No this here one, best time in Springfield yesterday, 1485 in the quarter. - Well my, my. - My, my, my you're looking good this morning, how's that mean old daddy of yours, he still won't let me on his land? - When did you say that dance was? - You wanna go?

Now, did anybody see you come in here? - Why, what's the big mystery? - I am going to read you this letter. And when I am finished I want you to forget that we ever had this conversation. Agreed? - Alright. - Dear daughters, if Ovey Green is reading this to you, then it means things aren't so good for your daddy. More than likely I haven't left much money but I did leave you something. Just the same you will have to dig for it. (engine rumbling) - Starkey's looking for you. Where you been? - Busy. How about you Sweetwater? Still hanging around the grade school? - You know a fellow can't hardly drive a car if his eyes are all swol shut. - That's true, then you can't swol eyes if your arms are broke. Thanks anyway. (country music) - Hi there JB. - Mayella, my, my aren't you grown up. Say you know there's something I always wanted to ask you Mayel? - What's that? - What do you call the other one? - You. (chuckling) You going up stairs? - Uh huh. - Okay. Mr. Starkey, JB Johnson's here. He asked you to wait. - Well I think I'll just go on up anyway. - Well you do just about any old thing you like, don't you? - Most generally Mayella. Why, what'd you have in mind? - They take after their daddy that's for sure. She must be up to something. She said they gonna stay on the farm, well we gotta do something about that because you said they'd leave after you got rid of their daddy. - Preacher why don't you shut your mouth huh? Honey I think maybe that'll take care of everything okay? Now you collect you're things, you can go. I sure did like that massage part, that was good. Maybe we can do that again sometime huh? That's really nice. Okay, I'll tell you what we'll settle up then, if you know what I mean. You dumb son of a bitch don't you ever say anything like that in front of anybody, you hear me? - I know what I said. - You don't know anything, now you understand? Now what I want out of you is to be their friend the preacher to them girls. Alright? - [Preacher] Yes sir. - And you go you there every chance you get and you console them. - [Preacher] Yes. - And you come back and you tell me everything they say, alright? - I surely will Mr. Stark. - Yeah, that's for your building fund, or what ever you call it this month. - Thank you Mr. Starkey, the lord praise your generosity. - Go on, get out. - Times up. - Well JB, you do push a man don't you? Come on in, come on, come on. - Yeah I guess I'm just naturally pushy. Were you taking up bible study? - Oh you mean the preacher? Just a little donation, us leading citizens, we have responsibilities. Did you ever hear that word? - [JB] Yeah I heard it but I forget. - You were supposed to make a run this morning weren't you? - Well it's still morning and here I am. - I believe I'd had you hung out our bait a long time ago JB if you weren't such a good driver. - I am the best fire cracker driver in this whole state and you know it. - I just can't figure you out you either crazy or you just plain don't give a damn. - There ya go. (laughs) Now where's the car? (sirens) Federal officers. (country music) - [Cop] Blow out his damn tires. (frantic country music) (horn) (frantic country music) (gun fires) (frantic country music) - Now it's the time for the big move. (frantic country music) (crashing) Thanks old stump. (country music) - 11, 12, 13, stop. And you're there, shit. - Now do you wanna admit we made a mistake somewhere down the hill? - Entrance all covered up over with ferns and brush. - Oh come on, there ain't nothing on this ground except dead leaves. - Wait a minute. The ground, that's it. Get over here. (banging) Come on Sissy. (dramatic music) (clattering) (dramatic music) - Wow look at the cheeses, what is all this? - [Dot] This honey is our inheritance. - [Betty] Why I just wonder how much all this stuff is worth. - [Dot] Aged whiskey like this in at today's prices has got to be worth thousands. - [Sissy] You're joking me? - No I'm not. Thousands and thousands of dollars, honey it's a blessed fortune. - What do you think about us, well you know just taking a few of these jugs, three are five corners, filling 'em up, giving the boys a little sample, just give a little sip to Spooner, another little taste to fat John Riggs? - Good idea. - Word will get around fast. - [Dot] Faster the better. - The only thing that worries me is. You know I just hate to give this stuff away. - You give 'em as much as it takes, when you're in a war you gotta shoot ammunition. - Well you're right about one thing, we are in a war and this sure is mellow stuff! - Well ladies here's to our pap. - That do it to you? - That's nice, that's nice, have some. - He sure did make good shine. - Shine? Honey that ain't shine, that's real prohibition bootleg. - What's that? - Don't you remember paps letter? Look. During prohibition my partner Henry Starkey, that's Jack Starkey's father, turned me in for reward money. I went to prison for five years but first I tucked away a truck load of prime whiskey for my girls. It's real fine whiskey so sell it dear. And get yourselves out of these hills, life is to hard and the men are mean and ignorant. Good luck and take care of little Sissy. You're loving pappy. She'll be alright. Come on over and join me for a drink. - Yes ma'am. You got a good idea every now and then. - Glad you approve. Think we'll have much trouble selling this? - Honey I thought I died and went to heaven. (laughs) - [Sissy] Hey you two, come here. Look. - [Betty] Hey! - [Dot] Well you know what? I figured pap was to smart an old wood chuck. There's always another entrance to a burrow. - [Betty] Come on, let's see where it goes. - Okay, Here, wait a minute. (dramatic music) - Oh Dot, you're not gonna believe this. - [Dot] Do you see light? - [Betty] Yeah I can see it. - [Dot] Keep crawling. (dramatic music) - Hey, where are we? - I don't know. You know what? Couple of rifles up here we could hold off 20 men. - We might have to. - I'm scared. We need some guys. - We will be alright. - JB Johnson might help us. - You might be of some help yourself, get on back down there and blow those candles out before we blow the whole place up. - Sissy's right, we do need a man. And besides JB's always been just plain silly about you. - No. - Well why not? You know he's the best driver. - I said no. JB Johnson is a no good smiling skunk and you can't rely on him. Besides you know one of these days he's gonna come to a bad end. - Well Larkin how's business? - JB. - Uh huh. - Is this yours? - No mines in town getting a lube job. - Oh I see. Got anything in the trunk? - No. - Come on JB let's take a look. Let me have a look, come on. - Satisfied? - Shut it up. Oh my. Modified? - No, stock. - You know JB I'm gonna have to look underneath in the back. - Suite yourself. - where do you keep the papers on this thing? - Under the visor where they usually are. Say you sure you wanna get under this thing? - You just put something under the rear end. - What are these tanks here JB? - [JB] What tanks are those? - These two tanks here, two of 'em right up under the frame. - Oh those tanks, those are extra gas tanks. - [Larkin] Gas? - Yes you know, gas prices being what they are. They save money filling up at cheap stations. - [Larkin] They? - The company I make deliveries for. - Get me up. - Sorry. - That company that you make deliveries for, you think I'm stupid JB? - No sir. - You think I don't know who hires mercenaries like you? - Mercenaries, that's a hard word sheriff. - Gun runners, killers, people by high, moonshiners. I suppose you think I don't know what's going on behind my back. Hell I know you got a fist full of phony papers in there. I got my eye on you JB, nothing goes on in this county that I don't know about, nothing. - I know. - You make one small mistake I'm gonna be all over you like a pack a dogs. Oh and you can tell that company that you work for I got eyes in the back of my head. - I will. - I'll tell you something, I don't miss a thing. - I know you don't. - Get this outta here. (country music) (laughing) (barking) (growling) - Just get right back in, hush up. - Hey that's not very lady like Dot. - Well I'm no lady so don't push your luck. - Whatever you say. I just come by to express my condolences. (gun clicks) And make you a business offer. - I don't want your dirty condolences. - Aw come on now Dot you know we can talk this thing over. (gun clicks) Sensibly. You know I'd like to rebuild your daddy's old still and I'll pay you double regular wages to run it for me. - We don't need your filthy money. - Oh? And how you all gonna live? - Hounding the hogs Starkey. - Hound the hog? How growing turnips? - Maybe Sweetwater and his killers screwed up Starkey, maybe they missed some of paps whisky. - (chuckles) I don't know what you're talking about. (barking) - I ought blow that mutts head off. - You do and you'll be walking bow legged the rest of your life. - Put that damned thing away you fool. - Two bit whores. (barking) - watch out! (yelling) (growling) (laughing) (yelling) - What she mean you missed some whiskey? - She's lying I got it all. Jesus I think I'm bleeding. - I don't give a damn what you doing, I'm gonna find out what going on around here, you understand me? - [JB] Uncle Bill. - Hey JB what do you say? Where you been at whole time? - Oh I've been in Springfield for a couple of days. - Ya? - Bill what have you been drinking? - This and that. (laughs) - Why don't you try some musketell, it'll be an improvement. - Aw thank you JB you know you always did a good old boy, you know that? Say did you hear about my brother getting shot? - What? - They shot by brother up to stealing and blew the shit out all the boys. - Who, who did? - Could have been anybody, some's a guessing, some's a knowing. (chuckles) - Wait a minute uncle Bill do you know? - I don't know nothing JB, and don't you go telling Dotty you hear me? Or else your gonna end up the blaze a shit you hear. - Damn.

About 50 percent better. - Well maybe. - I'll take 50 percent less. - Not very good business. - Tom a woman has to give to get, when she's just starting out. - Well, maybe I could some on consignment. - About 50 gallons. - No, no, no, ten. - 25. - Alright. - Now you send somebody to that shack by the water tank, they'll be 25 gallons waiting for ya, another 25 on Thursday.

But I want you to know my sides not about to quit. - My side, what the hell are you talking about now? - They just burned Tom Scudins all to chitlins and your buddy Harley? He's squashed like a bug under a mustang. - What? - Thought maybe you'd like to know what kind of company you been keeping. - Come on back to bed JB. - Go ahead. - Looks like you already know. - Dotty, Dotty, Dotty! Dotty come. (engine rumbles) - I knew the minute Dotty brought me out here I was gonna end up a blaze of shit. God damn women. Damn son of a bitch a yellow car. - I figured Harley was getting that ready for you. - It's evidence isn't it? - I had a 2,000 dollar engine and 800 dollars worth of tools in that garage, Larkin would have tied all of it up for evidence so I made a few changes. I dragged Harley under an old Chevy. - That's against the law. - So is making moonshine and a million other things. - [Dot] Are you changing sides JB? - I never had a side until now. - Okay, if you're gonna be in on this I guess you ought to know what it's about. Come on. - Where they going? - Why don't you just mind your own business? And get in there and clean up those dishes. - Shit, you remind me of my fourth wife, used to pay me while kep. - Yeah it's good, but it's nothing worth getting killed over. Look we gotta get rid of all of this stuff as quick as we can. - Maybe, and maybe not. - What do you intend to do, make runs to Springfield in that Mustang? - That's right, I'm gonna deal with Starkey's own buyers and I'm gonna squeeze him right out. - Is that so? Well tell me what's the buyers name? And where ya gonna find him? - I'll find him and nobody asked you for any of your smart advice, I'm doing this my way. - You know you really are something, you know that lady? And I suppose you intend to do all your own driving to? - That's right. (engine rumbling) - 324 is the shortest way to the county line then state 15 to Beasley, there are fewer choke holds that way. - I know the way to Springfield JB. - Maybe you can tell me what's up ahead beyond this Billboard to. - You think you know everything don't you? - Just about. - Ha, oh brother. - Steady 55 all the way, the whole idea is not to draw attention. No sharp turns, no fast corners, you're just another little house wife out to the super market. And keep checking your rear view mirror. You keep checking cause if they come they're gonna come fast and then you're gonna have to floor it. Then we'll see what kind of driver you really are. (dramatic country music) Hey, what's going on? - I don't recognize them and they came up fast. - It's a road runner, it'll over see ya. We gotta make it spin out. - Do you know who it is? - Look there's a dirt road up ahead beyond that gas station, it'll lead to the interstate. - Yeah I know that road. - Shift down when I tell ya. Shift down, now, now. (tires screeching) (country music) We still got him. (frantic country music) If we make him spin out we can lose him. (dramatic music) (country music) Take the left fork. Left take the left one! - Shut up! (country music) (dramatic music) - [JB] Look out. (yelling) (splashes) (gasping) (splashing) - [Dot] Leave me alone!

Look it ain't gonna be long before Starkey finds out that we're not at the bottom of that lake like fish food you know. - So what? The sooner the better. - Listen girl we don't have much time, I'm going to town, I'm gonna get a truck and we're gonna move that merchandise tonight. - Is that so? Well I ain't running. - Well then you just do what ever the hell you wanna do. I'm gonna be at the Candy Apple, everything I got is tied up in that car. - Don't I know it. - And what's that supposed to mean? - It means you can go back to your teenage nitwits anytime you want because I don't give a shit. - Oh yeah well let me tell you I'll take a warm loving teenage nitwit any day to a cold old dried up maid like you. - Shut up! - Makes out she's tougher than a man, no smiles, no laughs, no love. - Shut up you chicken shit! - Why don't you just admit it, you're scared of men, you hate men. - Shut up!
