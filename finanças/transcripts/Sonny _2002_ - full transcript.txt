Okay, okay, I'm coming, god dammit! Sonny? Hey, Mama. Open the door. My baby, Sonny! Why didn't you let me know you was coming? My papers got processed yesterday. I caught the first bus I could. Let me look at you. - Mama, I got your favorite. - Why, you haven't changed a bit. Let's get out of the sun, okay? Carol, come here right now and meet my boy. I want you to meet my new girl. You're gonna love her to death. Here, sit yourself down. I'm so glad you came home. You've no idea how crazy things have been here without you. Old Henry. He don't make as much money as he used to. Not that he ever made much anyway. And naturally, your poor mama can't work no more. But Carol, she does pretty good. Carol, I said get your ass in here right now and meet my boy! Like I said, she does pretty good now. But with you to teach her, she'll make a fine deal of money. Mom, please. Just slow down, okay? Slow down. Her last old man beat her half to death, left her in the hospital. I paid the bill, brought her home. I knew when I saw her that she was gonna make a good one. I said to myself, "Yes, sir... "she'll make a fine little partner for Sonny when he gets home. "These two are gonna make a lot of money together." Carol, God damn it! What're you doing sneaking up on me like that? Get over here and meet my boy. Carol Lees, my boy Sonny, the best there ever was. I know because I trained him myself. Glad to meet you. Heard a great deal about you. Mama talks a lot more than she should. Come into the kitchen. I'll fix you something to eat. Now you go get ready. You've got a 10:30 date with Troy. And don't let him have no more half-and-half for $100. He either pays $200 or he gets it straight. Same as everybody else. Damn stupid girl. She'd give it away if I didn't stay on top of her all the time. How do you like Carol? - She's a nice girl. - She's a moneymaker, too. You teach her a few things, she's gonna be the best around here. I'll get your nice, white suit cleaned and pressed. You'll be right back where you was before you left. I'm not gonna do that kind of work anymore. What you talking about? There's this guy I know. His father owns a bookstore in Texas City... and I was thinking about going there for a job. You only just got home. You're thinking about leaving again already? I'll send you money. Selling books? You? What the hell you know about books? You ain't never read nothing. Mama, those days are over. - I'm too old for that now. - Old? You're better-looking than you ever was. You ain't aged a day since you've been away. I gave you the best training there was since you was a boy. You want to throw all that away when you're in the prime of your life? I won't hear of it. I'm 26 years old. I don't want to screw all night anymore. I don't have the stomach for it. I gave up my best years so you could have everything you needed. You listen to your mama. You could work for your dates. People still talk about you. You can make three times the money you used to, for the same amount of time. And if you work doubles with Carol, you're gonna make $5,000 a week, easy. Mama, I'm going down to get that job in Texas City, all right? So just get used to the idea. I'm sorry, Mama. It's just... I learned there's more to life than hustling tricks. I wanna find something to do so I don't end up... End up like what? So you don't have to end up like me? Is that what you're trying to say? I'm sorry, Mama. You ungrateful son of a bitch! Go ahead! You go try be a square. But they don't want you either. You think you're the first one who's ever tried to quit? Oh, man. Finish it, damn you. Finish it! I want the Pontiac, Troy. That's a $5,000 automobile, darling. I want it for a month till Sonny can buy one for himself. Just finish it. And then, we'll talk about it, all right? You're not listening. I said I want the Pontiac, Troy. All right. Just finish it. One of my tricks decided to let you use his car until you get on your feet. There's $100, too. You need some clothes. I know this used to be your room, so I'll move out if you don't want me here. No, you can stay. You still need some money until you can earn some. You want any help? Do I have to fuck for it? Yeah. There's $100 and a new car outside. I don't think I got it all paid for yet. It's funny. I've never paid for it before. It's crazy like this. Come on, Sonny. Now, baby. Patience. You said you wanted to get what you paid for. I'm telling you what I want. I'm afraid your time is up. But we haven't done anything yet. A conversation is all you get from me for $100. Now I know why your mother calls you a natural-born whore. That's not the reason. Oh, God. I'll be gentle. Boo. Old thieves never die. They just never die. Damn, boy, where do you get off joining the Army and being gone so long? Just trying to get away from Mama for a while. Which is more than I can say you've ever been able to do. Old Jewel would go out of her mind if she didn't have me to look after her. Making any money? I pay my rent and have a drink now and then. I don't need much. That little gal in there any good? What do you mean? She's been living here three months and you don't know? I don't lie, boy. Your mama would feed me to the chickens... if she found me messing with one of her girls. I just like to do a little speculating now and then. You know what I mean. Breakfast is ready. You two get in here before it gets cold. All right, hold your horses, woman. We're coming. - You hungry? - Yeah. Wake up, you fine little outlaw from Arkansas. Henry Wade, you lecherous old cocksucker. I told you not to do that anymore. I'm gonna take it in a little bit right here. Give it a nice taper through the shoulders and the back. That's great. I like a nice tight fit in the back. Listen, Walter, I figured since I was in here... I'd ask you if there's any work here available in the store. I mean, I've got some other options... but I thought I might ask. I really like this material. I'll think about it, Sonny. Time for a career change? Oh, my God, Sonny? When did you get in town? - Mr. Phillips, will there be anything else? - No, that's it. This will be ready in a couple of days... and I'll wrap up those other items you wanted. Okay, thank you. Yeah, I just got back yesterday. It's been so many years since I've seen you. Where did you go? I was in the Army. Yes, I remember now. Somebody told me. Sonny, what in the world would you wanna go join the Army for? I don't think you'd understand. I'm terribly sorry. Sonny Phillips, this is Catherine Putnam. Hi. Nice to meet you, Catherine. It's a pleasure. Sonny is a dear old friend of mine. - I'm sorry. It's Meg. - How's your husband, Meg? I traded that old dud in for a new one, since I've seen you. I met a very nice, quiet little surgeon... who's an absolute dear. He really is. The only trouble is he watches how much money I'm spending too closely. I'm sure you'll manage. I see you still have your taste in clothes. Are you still... working? No. I'm just here spending some of my discharge money. That's a real shame. What happened? Did the Army break you? Yeah, I guess. That'll be $432.82. Can I help you? Sonny is the young man I was telling you about... who used to spend so much time with me at the lake. This is an occasion. Would you have a drink with us? - Just a drink. - A drink, right now? - Just a drink, you dirty youngster, you. - Come on. - Catherine's all right, we can talk. - No doubt about that. It's tempting. Your change. And I'll let you know if anything changes... but I don't foresee any openings in the near future. Okay, thanks a lot. Please, just one drink? - A small drink. - Come on, be a sport. I don't know if I can pass this up. Come on, honey. It's so nice to see you. Baby, I'm so glad you're home. Henry is in jail. He called me about an hour ago. - What's he in jail for? - Shoplifting. Why are you getting upset? He's been in jail for that more times than I can count. I know. I just get so worried sometimes. Henry's getting too old to be going to jail every week. He's all I got. Anything happens to him, I don't know what I'd do. All right. Did you call the bondsman? He's gonna meet us down at the jail... as soon as Carol gets back. Why when Carol gets back? Sonny, you've been gone over three years. Things change. The bondsman knows I got a girl with me. Henry won't get out till Monday morning... unless Carol comes with us and spends a few minutes with him. I'm sorry I didn't ask you first about Carol coming with us. I just kept thinking of poor old Henry laying up in that jail for three days. That's all right, Mama. If that's how you've been dealing with it... nothing we can do about it now. - I love you, Sonny-boy. - I love you, Mom. What's the matter? Shut up, God damn it. I don't want Sonny to hear. Hear what? Henry's in jail. - So? What else is new? - I want him out tonight. Call the bondsman, like you always do, and tell him to send a runner for the money. I'm going to shower. It's been a long day. Now you listen to me, bitch. You better listen good. You don't know Sonny like I do. You spend one night with him, you think he'll do anything for you. He's that way because I trained him to be that way. So don't you go getting no fancy ideas... about running off and living happily ever after in Texas City. Because he don't care a damn thing about you. You still belong to me, girl. And you still do as I say. If you don't... I'll have you cut and thrown out into the street for the winos. Sonny won't even notice you're gone. Do I make myself clear? What's the matter with you? I never seen you like this before. You better hope you never have to see me like this again. The bondsman says he wants to spend a little time with you tonight... or he won't pull Henry till Monday. So after we get him out of jail, I want you to take the money to his office... and give him what he wants, you hear? He's never wanted a date before. Why does he want one all of a sudden? Because I told him he could have one, that's why. You'll wait for me back at the house? Go on and get Henry. I'll see you in a couple of hours. I wanna have me a baby. Doing this whole thing, you ever see Mama accept you? I can't afford to be that realistic. If I look too close in the mirror, I might see me. I don't think I'm quite ready for that. Hand me that smoke? Can I have a light? Where's everybody at? Your mama took Carol up to Ponchatoula to work. She's booked for a week at the Liberty Hotel. So that just leaves... me and you. Hell of a lifestyle we've got going here, man. It's always better at night than it is in the morning. You know what you got to do, Sonny? You got to face the fact that this is all there is. Everybody else seems to be getting what they want without much trouble. That's because you're looking at it from your side of the fence. All of them squares out there... They got just as many problems as you've got. So you think I should stay, too? No, I ain't saying that. I'm just... I just want you to understand that if you're going over to the other side... that you're gonna inherit a whole new set of problems. Staying or going is up to you. I care for you, boy. I just don't want you getting into anything... that you can't handle. I'm not stupid. I know that. Jewel taught you a lot. As long as you're dealing with things you're familiar with. But getting up in the morning, going to work, raising kids... and joining the PTA... and all them other things you're craving for... It's a lot different in flesh than it is in your head. I just don't want to get old and not have anything to show for it. You and Mama, you're gonna... start thinking you're something ugly to me, and that's not true. You don't have to start feeling sorry for me. Ain't never been a moment in my life when I was wishing I was somebody else. It's me that's feeling the pity, boy. You think you're gonna get that job down there? Yeah. I don't know. I got this friend Jesse I was stationed with. His father owns a bookstore and he said... when I get out, come on down, and he'd get me a job. Are you sure this kid ain't blowing smoke up your ass? No, Jesse is a good guy. He really wants me to come down. Does he know anything about your background? Very little. Good. Good luck to you. I hope you make it. You don't have any idea how much I hope you make it. Why? Maybe I just wanna see if one of us can. What're you doing? Cleaning your carpet? I didn't think you'd make it. I need that job. You went by the shop first? Yeah, they said there's a new owner. You wouldn't happen to be in the market for a $50 a week meat bill, would you? You look pretty happy here. Come on in the house, I'll buy you a beer. Come on, Tuck. So what happened? It was the fucking bank. Old man got behind on some debts. Too proud to tell me, I guess. By the time I got back, there was nothing I could do. Not like there was anything I could do, anyhow. Is there any chance of getting anything back? Old man's dying of cancer. Something else he forgets to mention. By the time I get back to bury him, too late. It's over. No. It's already gone. I mean, the house is gone, too. I had to get a court order to keep living in it, until I find something else. This is for you. The Stranger. Read it, it's good. - "Camus." - Camus. Thanks. What are you... What's Plan B? Plan B. I don't know. Start thinking about re-enlisting, you know? Ain't no jobs around here. Shit. Jesse, I was hoping you could... - Fuck it. - Look, man, come on. It ain't all rain clouds and gloom, you know. It ain't. Listen to this. While you're here, I've got these two sisters. All right? - They are good-looking sisters. - So? So, I go with one of them, sort of. And the other one... her older sister. She has an amazing area. Love it. What, like, we'll go out on a date? Like, a real date? We're friends, right? I can ask you a question because we're friends, right? Yeah, I'm a friend. You know, there was some talk... back in the Army. You never went out and socialized with a lady very often. And it is none of my business... but if you don't like girls, you know... No, it ain't that. It's just, you know... I ain't never been out on a real date before. I don't understand. Why not? It's a long story. I'm not up for it now. I guess I'm just worried I wouldn't know how to act. It's time you learned. You just be yourself. Smile. We'll go out and have a good time. Why are you blowing on it? It ain't hot. He blows on the ice cream before he eats it. Guess I thought it was for a second. You blew on the ice cream? - What do you think? - I liked it. Good. It was all right. Oh, yeah, rough. First movie I've seen in a long time. Birds. - Cold? - Yes. - You think you can give that up? - I live here! - Let me take that. - Thanks. You think we can navigate those two over to the couch? Why don't we put on some music? You're gonna wake up Wendy. Wait. You mean there's three of you here? - You know we had a kid sister! - I did not. That's because you've never been here in the daytime. That's true. Why don't you put on some music? Thanks. So, what do you do? Do? Do what? For a living. All night long we've talked about Jesse's father... or my sister's sex life. You haven't said six words about yourself. I don't know what I do. I came out here looking for a job. You're a strange man. Why? I don't quite know. You're a funny mix. Something... real smooth and easy... and kind of awkward, like a little kid. I'm just going through a transition thing. I'll get more relaxed as I go. What are you doing? Are you making a move on me? Yeah, I guess. That's okay, isn't it? Yeah, that's okay. I promise that. Oh, my God! That was amazing! You know, you should do that for a living. I do. What? I mean, I used to. What do you mean, you used to? You asked me what I did out there. I used to be a whore. What do you mean that you used to be a whore? Only women are whores. Now you're starting to sound like a man. Wait a minute. I thought you were in the Army. - With Jesse... - I was. I was. This is before the Army. I don't do it anymore. I'm through with that world. I like this world much better. I do. You know what? I have to go to the bathroom. So stay right here, okay? I'll be right back. I just told you that because I wanted to be honest... What's that? I have asthma. So sometimes I can't sleep. You think I don't know what this shit is? No, it's just cough syrup. You think I haven't seen people with stomach habits? It's cough syrup! Fucking Codeine. How bad are you strung out? What? What's the matter with you? I'm crazy? Isn't anyone in the world straight anymore? Stop that! What're you doing? Don't touch my stuff! Stop it! No! You're spilling my medicine! Fuck you! - What's going on, man? - Your friend's a junkie. She's not a junkie. She drinks cough syrup, all right? - You mean, you knew? - Yeah, so what? So what? I guzzle beer. You break shit. She drinks cough syrup. So what? - It's supposed to be different. - What's supposed to be different? You, her, the whole thing is supposed to be different. - What's going on? - Just go back to bed. I want him out of here! Why? Am I unclean? Am I not clean enough for you? Am I sick? Is that why? I'm better than all you bullshit squares! - Get him out of here! - Then you can go back to your fucking life! - Go to bed. - Get him out of here. You want me out? Get the fuck away from me! - I said everything's fine! - Get away! Why don't you get the fuck out? Get the fuck away from me! You want me out of your house? You want me out of here? Will that make you happy? You want me out? All right, you can go back to your fucking life! Get the fuck away from me! Cool it. I'm better than you! I'm better than all of you! Fuck you! You out all night? Yeah, I tried not to wake you. Adonis. You going out again? Aren't you gonna wear your white suit? It always looked so good on you. Why don't you just let me wear what I want to wear? Not quite like you thought, was it? I don't wanna talk about it. I know, baby. I know, I understand. You go on about your business... and I'll call around town, see what's going on for you. I can take care of myself. Sonny, my baby. I was so scared I was gonna lose you forever. I need you. Ain't got no pension, no nothing. I just got you. You're the only thing I got to show for my life. You're the only good thing that ever happened to me. I need you. You're all I got! You're gonna wrinkle my shirt. Tell me you know you're all I got. - Come on, I gotta go! - Tell me, damn you! I know. Oh, God, Sonny! Did you make it? I'm sorry. I tried not to... but I guess I'm out of practice. You mad at me? Oh, baby, I'm not mad at you. I couldn't be mad at you. That's what you're here for. I just wanted to spend more time. We are so good together. I just wanted to please you. Could you tell that? - You did it. - Did I? - I missed you, lady. - Did you really? Yeah, I sure did. Well, I better get... Oh, my God! Do you have to get back pretty soon? What time is it? 10:00. Shit! I gotta pick up Harry at the airport at 11:00. I have to see you again. I gotta see you again. - Where can I get in touch with you? - I'll give you my number. I'd do it every week... but you know how it is. New husband, new rules. I'll find a way around it somehow, I know I will. You can call me here anytime. Just leave me your name... and the number you're at, and when you wanna do it. Thank you. You're gonna miss that plane. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I wasn't thinking about it, I guess. Oh, baby, I only have $150 in cash. Can I write you a check? You know that I can't take a check, Meg. That's right. Oh, boy, I certainly can't write a check for this one, either. Sorry. It's no big deal. We're friends, right? Maybe you can do a little favor for me. Any of your friends want a date, maybe you can have them call me. Yeah, I'll do what I can. I just... I haven't been around for a while... and I don't really know anyone anymore. I'll make a call for you. I gotta get going. I'll see you, then. Nothing. I'll help you all I can, angel. Thanks, Meg, I could really use it right now. 'Bye. Yeah, is Mattie Sullivan there? Tell her it's Sonny Phillips. Mattie, there's a telephone call for you. Excuse me. I'll take it upstairs with my mint julep. Have a good time, Jimmy? Mattie, there's never a dull moment in your place. Come on, baby. Hello? I'll be damned. Jewel said you were back. About an hour ago. She said you were working. Come on! You know she's just trying to look after you. I got one for you right now, if you're available. No, a road trip. Dress date. Gabe, you got a pen? - Here you go, Sonny. - Thanks. Go ahead. Wait, hold on a minute. How about I work it as a plainclothesman? All right. I'll call Henry. He'll know where I can get one. Get out here! He's coming, baby. Can't even take a crap in peace anymore. - What do you want? - Shut up and come talk to Sonny. He needs something. How's it going, boy? I got a friend of mine that's working nights. I can probably borrow his. How was Texas City? That's all right. Something better will come along. Sorry it didn't work out. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Just come by the house in about an hour... and I'll have it for you, all right? I'll see you then. You didn't even give the boy a chance. Don't worry about it. He's doing what he's best at. Yeah, that's right. Driving himself off a cliff. Just like you taught him, right? I hope it fits. Don't matter, as long as I can get it on. Remember Albert, the guy who fences my stuff? He says he can get you on to the Safeway warehouse over on Cooper Street. Wouldn't pay much to start, but you can work your way up. Half the people in the Quarter know me as a whore. No one's gonna give me a straight job. That's bullshit. Albert says he can get you on. I gotta go. You're 26 years old. How much longer do you think you can keep this up? As long as I have to. It's a young man's game, Sonny. Time to change. You're gonna make me blow the trick. I'm late anyway. At least just think about it. I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am, there's been a report... of a prowler in the area... and I'd really like to come in and check things out, if I may. I'm sorry, but my husband isn't home right now. That's okay, it won't take but a minute. Please... I think you'd feel a lot better if I come check things out. Okay, but just for a moment. Thank you. So you're here all alone? Yes, my husband's out of town on business. Where do you sleep? Upstairs. Why? I'd like to make sure the bedroom is secure... because this house will take all day to check. Don't you guys all work in pairs? Where's the other one? The other one? Yeah, my partner, he's checking next door. So, where's the bedroom? This way. This is it. It doesn't look like he's in here. Maybe he got away. All right, lady, you're under arrest. Please, I don't want to go to jail. So, you're gonna resist. I'm gonna have to handcuff you to the cot here. Please. Please. I'll do anything you ask. Just don't take me to jail. - Anything? - Yes. Anything you want. Leave the uniform on. Oh, God! The stick. Use the stick. This is only $200. I know. The price is $300. $200 is all I'm gonna give you. I'm sorry you feel that way. What the hell's the matter with you? Here I am, a nice young kid, trying to work my way through college. Fucking sleazy old broads like you. I can't even get paid for it! - What about here? - What are you doing? - This is probably worth $300. - No, please! It's a little heavy. That should do it. What am I going to do with a busted TV? - I said okay. - I can't hear you. What? How much can I get for these? All right, I'll pay you! There, whore. Take your money and go. Mind if I go pick up Carol in Ponchatoula? No, I'll call her. Let her know you're coming. You two are gonna work some doubles together? Yeah, we'll see what's out there. I'll call around. Let people know you're working again. Thanks, Mama. How was that trick Mattie gave you? It was okay. Just a straight $300 dress thing. She got any more? I'll call and find out. Thanks, Mama. Papa Legba, Papa Legba. Keeper of the crossroads, and guardian of the flame. I'm trying to get a little one back again. I know you can help me. And I do miss her. - How you doing? - My man. I'm all right, it's been a long time. - Cool. - How are you? - I'm fine, man. - Good. I'm working again. Wondering if you had anything for me. Damn, we hardly ever get any more calls around here for pony rides. But every once in a while, we get a farmer's wife... that comes here for a grudge fuck. I don't want any of them mojo women. They're bad energy. You get anything good, call me. You know you get the first crack at any class chicks I get coming through here. Carol ready? That's right. Jewel did call and say you was with her. Let me call and let her know you're here. Carol, Sonny's here to pick you up. Cool, I'll tell him. Man, she'll be right down. It was the good old days, wasn't it? I don't know. I was too young to remember. Hey, baby. Hey there, mama. - Hey there, pretty girl. - How are you? - Come on, let's get out of here. - Tally it up, old man. I'm gonna get home and give my man something nice. All right. That looks like a shotgun hole. It was a long time ago. Twenty years ago my mama used to work here. One day this Texas pimp came in, tried to steal her back to Dallas. She runs to the room and calls my daddy. My daddy runs through that door with this sawed-off shotgun. Pimp's sitting right over here. And my dad lets this load of double-ought buckshot right past his nose. That pimp was up, out of here. Never heard from again. That's the only story my mama ever told me about my daddy. - What happened to him? - I don't know. I never met him. He just up and left. Mama won't talk about him. I don't even know what he looked like. Cal, you remember what my daddy looked like? I remember nothing. So it goes. - How was your week? - Terrible. Doesn't seem to get any better. - Why don't you quit? - And do what? Troy, who loaned us his car, has been asking me to marry him for over a year. I keep waiting for something better to happen. You might be waiting a long time. I don't know about that. I kind of like being wooed. You want to work together? I don't care what we're doing, as long as I'm with you. Mama's trying to hook up some doubles for us. If you want to try it out, we can see how it goes. That's fine with me. How was your week? It was all right. Thanks, baby. Wait a minute. Hold your fucking horses. You can't even see them things. What are you taking so long for? I know you can't use a 10 of clubs, you old fuck. Only one way to find out. Henry, when you're right... you're wrong. Gin. I don't know. That's a double snide, and two 2s... $40. We're home, in town. Sonny, baby! Here, let me get that. - You had a good week, honey? - More or less. Any calls? Yeah, things are really jumping. Meg called for you. She's gonna call back later today. Troy's been driving me nuts. Said you were supposed to see him today. He can wait. I'm going to take a shower. Probably just wants to ask me to marry him again. Hey there, old timer. How are you doing, sweetheart? Don't you "sweetheart" me, Henry Wade. You ain't getting off that easy this year. - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. Tomorrow's my birthday... and you promised you'll take me to Antoine's. Ain't been there since my glory days, and I want to go this year. God, I'm sorry, honey. I plum forgot. - Could we just do it next year? - Fuck that. I ain't made no money in a while. Besides that, I hate them goddamn stuck-up places. What about them three cameras you got out of that car yesterday? Them was cheap cameras, Jewel. Albert gave me enough for my room rent and to buy a little something to drink. You could take me out... if you didn't spend your money guzzling whiskey and gambling. The only thing you're good at is losing. You hold on, woman! We've been through all this before. I don't say nothing about your ass getting fatter every minute. You leave my ass out of this! You don't say nothing about my drinking or the gambling! You promised we'd eat there and I want to go! So, you get out there right now, this minute, and steal something. - It's gonna rain, Jewel. - I don't give a shit about rain. I wanna go out on my birthday, and you're gonna take me. Can you talk some sense into her? No, I ain't about get into the middle of this. What are you waiting for? Move! All right. If I take you to a restaurant... will you come and stay the night in my room? Not in front of my boy. Not in front of your boy? He's a grown man, for God's sake. Besides that, you've had him out selling cock since he was 12. It ain't like we haven't known each other. I'll think about it. But you gotta take me eating first. All right, but remember, you promised. - See you, Sonny. - See you later, ranger. Why don't you just give him some pussy? Is that any way to talk to your poor old Mama? Burn, baby, burn. Here's to Jewel Anne Phillips. The finest little lady in the state of Louisiana. You're gonna make me cry. Been a long time for us, ain't it? Nearly 30 years... if you count that little bit of time we was together... when you was in the Army. That long? Don't you think we ought to tell him? No, absolutely not. And, if you ever do, you'll never see me again. I promise you. You know you got the prettiest pussy. Excuse me, madam, but you have to keep your shoes on in the restaurant. I always take my shoes off when I'm eating. I've done that since I was a little girl. I'm sorry, but you're in violation of the State Health Codes. If you won't put your shoes on, I'll have to ask you to leave. But the state ain't gonna know I took my shoes off. I'm sorry, madam... but if you're trying to accustom yourself to eating indoors... using silverware and plates... then you're going to have to learn to wear shoes. Very well, then. I'll get your coat. You listen to me, mister. We ain't very sophisticated. We don't come in these places very often. But you just insulted my woman, in front of me, on her birthday. You're gonna trot back out there, and you're gonna apologize to her. If you don't, or if you call the fucking cops... or your bouncer has us thrown out of here... then I'm gonna be forced to stick a knife in your gut... on your way home from work. Am I coming through? Of course, Mr. Wade, whatever you say, sir. And the shoes stay right where they are. Remember, your health is in the balance. Ma'am, I'm sorry. Sonny, I was beginning to think you weren't coming. This must be Carol. Sonny's told me about you. Welcome to the party. Let me show you around. I want you to meet Scott. I know he's here somewhere. - You really have a very nice home. - Oh, yes. We just had it redecorated last year. You should've seen it before. It was really getting to be a mess. There he is. I want you to meet Sonny and Carol. This is the couple I was telling you about. - You real nice. - Scott, must you be so vulgar? They've only just arrived and already you're leering. - Sorry. - It's quite all right. We'll have plenty of time to get acquainted. Come on, Sonny, let me show you around. I'll see you next weekend. - Thank you. - Good night, Catherine. Nice party. Yes, a necessary evil. Did you enjoy yourself? It was great. I don't know what happens next. You wanna get serious, or what? Sonny, please. What do you want? I didn't mean to... I mean... I don't know what I mean. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna fuck your brains out, lady. I'm sorry. It's the beast in me. That feel good, Daddy? That's it. Give it to me, baby. - Like that? - Oh, yes! Faster! Gee whiz! That's it, baby! That's it, baby! - $500, right? - That's the price, baby. We'll find our own way out. Mommy! Good night. All right, come on. Let's run for it. Come on! That was a real winner we got in there. "Gee whiz, baby. "You're the best." He wasn't like that! Let's go for a drive. - Yeah? Aren't you tired? - No, are you? - Not really. - Let's go for a drive then. - Where to? - Anywhere. The country. Let's go for a ride in the country. - In the rain? - Sure. - At least there won't be much traffic. - All right. Come on. You said you wanna walk around in the mud. I never said anything about getting in with you. I don't wanna walk alone. I'll tell you what. Walk around the car a few times, you'll never notice I'm not walking with you. Come on! I ain't getting out there, when I know it's gonna start raining again any second. This is a $600 suit. I'll compromise with you. We can keep the windows down. We can talk while you walk. Do I make you happy? Yeah, sure. No, I mean really happy. What's "happy"? Why don't you tell me what it is that makes me happy. I'll tell you whether or not you're giving it to me. I love you. Shit! - Get under the tree. - Here it comes. Get under there. Sonny, look. - So? - Let's go over there. No, we'll get soaked. I promise to keep you occupied while our clothes dry. God help me for being so weak. All right. We'll run for it. You ready? All right, come on. What's that sound? I don't know. A cat maybe. Look, she must've just had them. Carol, dogs get born every day. I know. It's just... Fuck it. Christ, Carol, it's just dogs. It's not the dogs, is it? Don't tease me, Sonny. I'm human. I'm just like any other woman. Sometimes you act like a trick. You think we don't have any feelings. I didn't mean it. Here, let me see that. Don't touch me! Carol, you're not even being practical. What the hell does practical have to do with it? You tell me one thing that's practical about our lives anyway. That's exactly my point. No, our point is that I don't have the right to have a baby. It's not practical for a whore to do anything but lay down. I don't want to do this all my life. What the hell am I working for if I can't have a future? Carol, look at me. Look at me. What do you see? Don't you know Jewel wanted the same thing you want right now? - Don't you see the insanity of it? - Don't play me, man. Jewel didn't want you. You were a fucking accident and you know it. I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Come on. Let's get out of the rain. Sonny, why don't we square up? We can get married. Everybody else seems pretty up and doing it. We can't just pretend we're like other people. We're not. Then lie to me! It's what we've been doing all our lives, anyway. No matter what we do to stop it, we just get better. Why couldn't we just pretend? I could make myself believe it. I could, baby. How are we going to know what honesty between two people means? I don't care about honesty. I just want to be like everybody else. Let's go. Please, Sonny. Tell me someday it's going to be different. Please, baby, tell me that one thing. I need that. Please, baby, tell me. Come on. Let's go. I want to talk to you about something. Yeah, what is it? Troy asked me to marry him again. - So? - I'm going to take him up on it. Why? I feel like my life's passing me by. I've got make some kind of move. We just started working together. Things will pick up. They never will, Sonny. All we're ever going to get is older, and you know that. It's like you told me yesterday: we can't change what we are. I want to try. I guess I can't stop you. We can leave this place, if you want to. I'll come with you. Then I got to do what's best for me. Yeah, I understand. So no hard feelings? No. I understand what you're doing and why you're doing it. Baby. I have to go. Troy's taking me out to dinner. Have fun. I won't. Congratulations. I'll see you. Sure you want to play that? Gin! I beat you, you son of a bitch. I beat your ass. Had to happen sometime. I won, God damn it. So what? I won. Don't you understand? Yeah, I understand. You won. Now I have to close up. Late for dinner. I don't think you're getting it: I won. Henry, I get it. You won. It's been a long time, okay? But we'll play again tomorrow. Aren't you forgetting something here? Triple schneider and $60. Swinging. You know, Henry... when you're right... you're right. When you're wrong, you're right. Tonight, you're right. $60. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Going to win some of that money back you've been taking from me all these years. - That's good. But I still have to close up. - Sure. See you tomorrow, sucker. You don't have to get personal about it. I'm not getting personal. Things are just turning around for me. I can feel it. This is Henry's day, Albert. I still have to close up. You know, somehow... I never seem to get myself ready for this. Ain't nobody ever can. Henry was a good man, Sonny. I want you to know that. Yeah, I know he was, Mama. He was your father. What? Henry... was your father. I first met Henry about 30 years ago. I'd just been turned out. Henry was in the Army, home on leave. We set up a house down in Galveston. And I tried to square up but it was hard. I left him after a while... when he got transferred up north. Asshole. Couple of weeks later... I found out I was pregnant. Ten years later... Henry was passing through. He looked me up and that's when he found out. Kind of hung around after that. You didn't tell me, Mama. He wouldn't let me, baby. He didn't want you to know that your father was a failure. We're all failures, Mama. That's easier to say than to live with. Sonny baby, please... You could've told me, Mama. Sonny? What do you want? I want to talk to Acid Yellow. Just a minute. Acid Yellow says it's okay. Come on in. That is, I'll sit here. I'm looking out across yonder. And I see those black boys over there looking at my body. My bosom's heaving out of my corset. Pumping out of my corset, and all I can think is: "They can't put a croak on it." I'm watching those niggers and they're watching my lily-white boobies... Sonny, my God, sweetheart! What're you doing here, knocking on my door? Mark, get Sonny here something sweet to drink. Oh, God, it's so good to see you... Because Daddy's gonna suck Sonny's dick! Excuse me, I haven't been feeling well lately. I think I got that new bug. Boy, we certainly are delicious. Can you give me a date? Fuck me, man. You never worked me before. I tried to get you to work me, but you... Sit. I want some rough trade. I got a lot of energy. Sure, honey, I can get you something... but first, tell me why you switched after all these years. Can you give me a date or can't you? - What are you going to do for me? - Fuck you. There is a gentleman who'll be over in a few minutes. John's one of Rick's steady tricks. But I suppose I could let you have him. Rick hasn't been feeling well lately, either. I love coca! Do you know what's expected of you? Yeah, I know. Just show me the room. Now look, Sonny... John is a very prominent insurance executive. A steady customer of mine. You've got to be fun but kinky. I know what to do. Wait in here. It'll probably just be a minute. You sure you know what you're doing? Just shut up and get out of the room. You do have some energy tonight. Come in. I've been a bad boy. I need to be... punished. How would you like your punishment? In any manner that you see fit... master. Why do you feel like you need to be punished? Because... I've been mean to the people who work for me. Did you know your father? Why do you want to know that? Just answer me, you fucking squid. Did you know your father? My father's dead. So is mine. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Oh, my God! I'm sorry. You sorry motherfucker, that was my best trick! - Sorry. - Shut up, bitch! Cut his face! Cut his motherfucking face! You fucking cunt! How're you feeling? I heard about Henry. I'm sorry. I just came by for a suitcase and some of my things. Troy's outside. Came in a cab. I got to take the Pontiac back. We're driving it down to Mexico to get married. Where's Jewel? In the kitchen. You're going to be okay? I need to talk to you, baby. Sure. Outside. - Why? - Because I don't want her to hear. Come on. Get out, Sonny. - Get out of what? - You've got to get away from here. Right now, you've got to get away. It's my life. I chose it. I'll live it. It's not your life. And you didn't choose it. She chose it for you. - And she'll drag you down with it. - I can't leave her now. - I'm taking care of her. - Fuck her, man! Think about yourself for a change. She's always going to find girls to work for her and you know it. We could've made it, you and me. It would've been tough, but we could've made it. Now you see what I got to settle for? But I'm going to do it, man. I'm going to quit now. Right fucking now! Even if it means with him. You got to quit, too. Right now. Don't even go back in the house. Just run. I'm taking my shot, Sonny. I got to go. Here, wipe your fucking face off. You got mascara running all over the place. I'm sorry, Daddy. What the hell are you doing? Subtitles provided by SOFTITLER
