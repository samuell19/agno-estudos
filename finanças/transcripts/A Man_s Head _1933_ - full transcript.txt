Hello Willy! This is my friend, Willy Ferri?re. Nice to meet you! You're not good to me. You left me alone. Come tomorrow, I'll be alone. Don't worry about Fritz here, he can't speak French. OK, then sweetie. Tomorrow then. - Hello my little ones. - Hello. Are we playing belote? - Hello beautiful. - Can you lend me 2 louis? 2 louis! I'm strapped my dear. Hello, barman. - M. Ferri?re, how are you? - Ok. - Same old same old? - Yes. # After he finished off his last job, # # The handsome killer, was taken to... # How much is it all? - Including today, 1850 francs. - So tell me... The boss won't be happy. Couldn't you just pay off some of it? I'll see what I can do. Hello Willy, are things going badly? Watch out, there's my wife. OK, are you really marrying her? - Maybe. - Are you being robbed? - You never know. - I'm telling you! Watch out, she's after your money. I'm as poor as a church mouse! - Bonjour. - Bonjour. I'm knackered, I was dancing for 2 hours. - Why didn't you come? - I didn't have time. - You've nothing to do. - And that's why! - Hello. - Hello, madame. - Hello. - How are you? He hasn't rolled yet! Fancy a turn? - What do you want? - Pass me the dice cup, barman. - Thanks. - Oh, I say! Last night someone killed a pedlar for 25 francs. - That's pretty cheap. - It's not worth it. Not at that price. I'd give 100000 F to get rid of.. ...my aunt Henderson. Isn't that right, Edna? So you say. Give me an Alexandra. - The aunt with the big inheritance? - That's right, the big one. It's no good to her. She's crazy old woman, she lives alone. - And that makes her crazy? - She wants me to work. You dropped this M. Willy. 2 Cinzano, 1 white bordeaux. - Sit here, madame. - Thank you. -Whose turn? Mine? - Is it my turn? - Yes it is. [I]Agreed that for 100000F, [I/] [I]... your aunt Henderson will be got rid of.[I/] [I]Send address, key and map to M.V.. boulevard Raspail[I/] Calm down. They say: Unlucky at cards, lucky in love. What are you doing? Did you win? No. I made a decision. Which is... no? It's yes. - Idiot, light will be seen. - I was scared. Who did that? Was it you? Me? I just got here. But you, you weren't supposed to come. I changed my plan. You said the villa was empty and I'd find.. ...the money right there. I shouldn't have let myself be tempted. Show me your hands. Your prints are everywhere. And those? You told me to wear rubber soles.. ...to be quiet. Right... Get going! I'll clean all this up. Don't go back home. Be sensible. Du you have somewhere to lie low for a few days? Umm... no. Ah yes! My parents, in Nandy. Good, go there. Listen up! If they catch you, keep it shut. I will never be questioned. I take precautions. Understood? You don't know me! Even if you tell them, they won't believe you, there's no proof. But.. you'll say nothing, and I will save you. If they arrest you, I'll help you escape. Stay calm! Give me the plan. Don't worry, I'll clean everything. Mother! Come here! - What are you doing here? - Shh! - You're not at work? - Shh, not so loud! Listen... Don't tell Father that I'm here. Yesterday in Versailles an elderly american was murdered in her villa. Here is the report from Versailles. See that my dear Janvier. Are you taking Lucas? - Yes Boss. - Bien. Call me later then, I'll see you tonight. So then... Lucas! - What is it? - We're going to Versailles. - So be it. - To Versailles? - What is it? - A rich old lady. Take me with you. Lucas can stay at his post. - You don't mind, do you? - I don't care at all! - Go ask the Boss. - Thank you, I'll ask now. Why ask for this? You know I'm fascinated by investigations. Very well, off you go! You know me M. Maigret... I've told you not to call me M. Maigret. Yes Monsieur.. Yes Boss. - So, Versailles? - You're champing at the bit. - Off you go! - Yes, monsieur! Er... Yes Boss! - I did it, it's agreed. - To Versailles then. Good luck! It's a guy I met in Montparnasse. Watch out! - Don't you believe me? - I do! You think I killed her. - No. - I swear I didn't. I just needed money, he said it would be easy. - I didn't argue. - So he did it? No, I don't know. Listen, don't tell Father. I'll stay in the barn for a few days. No one has seen me I won't be found. There's no proof. He cleaned it all up. It's too good to be true. Whoever left this.. ...did it on purpose, or was a total amateur. Doctor, was she there when you found her? On her side or her stomach? On her back, it's in the report. That's odd, all the blood is on the bed. And nothing on the floor where she fell. It should be the other way around. The reporter wants to come in. He'll just get in the way. Are the servants there? Yes, in the corridor. Looks like rubber soles. There it is! I can read some numbers. 2... 7... 6, 8... or maybe 9. Don't block my shot, you'll have the enlargements tomorrow. - Well then... - I... I... I... No need for stage fright. He's worried because you're police. Jules... He wants to say that we heard nothing.. ...because we sleep in the pavillion in the garden. She was a crazy old woman.. ...well... She was a woman.. ...and she had her... her ways. Yes... Well at her age... it was understandable. Yes. After 8pm, she wanted the house empty. She said it was more peaceful to be alone. Of course if you're alone you lock up, but... That's enough! Did the victim have any family? None that we saw, right? Yes we did, M. Willy. - Oh yes! M. Willy. - Who is he? A gentleman, when he visits he calls me 'my good woman'... That's enough. - M. Willy, who is he? - A well-dressed man. - I didn't ask that. - The old lady's nephew. I mean, Mme Henderson. He's called Willy Ferri?re. Willy Ferri?re. Have you checked the locks? Intact. The killer had a key. Or they were opened from the inside. Well, yes. Where can we find M. Willy? 148, rue de Vaugirard. We'll call him! Why do you ask? Yes, Mme Henderson is my aunt. How? Murdered! Prints? Yes, monsieur. Pardon? 33, quai des Orf?vres. Murder investigations. 2pm, I'll be there. Your aunt was murdered? Well then, are you defintiely her sole beneficiary? A model 310000 by Sportex.. ...those shoes are stocked... ...in branch AX 25, boulevard des Invalides. Thank you. I want to know if you sold.. ...a shoe marked number 314286? - Probably. - Do you remember the customer? We don't ask them for their addresses. You can't sell that many size 11s. That pair went to the florist's delivery man. - Which florist? - Baudoin's, just opposite. - We haven't seen him today. - Why are you looking for him? - Is it an inheritance? - Good guess. - His name is Duverier? - No, it's Joseph Heurtin. Do you know his adress? -H?tel Beaus?jour. Rue de la Grande Chaumi?re. We haven't seen him since yesterday. Show me the register? It's all above board. I don't care, that's up to the hotel inspectors. Ah... Joseph Heurtin. Room 12. Since February 15. - Right? - Yes. Right, open the room for us. Do you have a warrant? Open it, we'll owe you one. It all seems to fit. "From your loving mother." What type of man is Heurtin? Oh... One who wouldn't hurt a fly. Reliable? I think so. A straight-up type. - Straight-up? - He paid his bills on time. Was he always here alone? This is a respectable place! Pull the other one. - Is he a big man? - Yes. Does he have any family? I think so, he's not much of a talker. He had a phone call once, from his mother. - From Nandy. - Nandy? Where's that? Seine-et-Oise, next to Corbeil. Off we go. What's going on? They look terrible. Here he comes. Move along. Get going. I want to believe you ...tell me where you spent that night. Um... I don't know. - I went to the cinema. - Hmmm! What did you see? I don't remember. Why make it difficult? We know you're lying. How did you force the lock at the villa? I didn't, it was already open. So you weren't at the cinema. Cigarette? Why did you go into the Henderson villa ...and not another? - Because of the money. - And how did you know.. - ...that there was money? - I knew it. And you found that out by yourself. You seemed like an honest worker. Why the sudden change? I don't know. - Who told you about it? - No one. Do you know where this defence will get you? You will be guillotined, young man. - I didn't kill her. - So be it! You weren't planning to kill the old lady, ...but she heard a noise, she screamed. You hit her to shut her up. No, it wasn't me. So it was the man who was with you? I was alone. - Where's the knife? - I didn't kill her. Idiot! You left prints all over the room. That's not true, I left nothing. - It was all cleaned up. - Who by? You? Look at me! Tell me the truth. Come on? I'm not a bad man. I didn't kill her. To the cells. Go. Move along. Did that seem fishy to you? No. About 30 minutes after death Henderson's body.. ...fell from the bed to the floor. Ah... yes. I saw blood on the bed but not on the floor. - Bonjour, boss. - Bonjour... Well? I checked Willy Ferri?re's alibi. - Mme Henderson's nephew. - All the witnesses agree. He was with friends in the Constantinople all night. The door was open and you came in. Yes. Bonjour, gentlemen. I was called here. Have you ever seen that man before? M. Ferri?re, ...do you know this man? I don't know him. No, I've never seen him before. Very good. Continue. Then you went to the first floor? Come on, show us! Let's go up. Make them stay there. Move along. Well? I must warn you, Dear Sir, that if your client.. ...doesn't stop playing dumb, I'll put a stop to this. He is upset M. le juge. It's understandable. He's being over-sensitive. Hurry up! You said that when you came in, ...Mme Henderson was already dead in her bed. - Yes. - Get in position. You told us that it was dark. Yes. Why did you go to the bed first? I don't know. Ah... At that moment the body fell to the floor. There? Yes. And it fell there? As I moved back. And then? Then I was scared. I turned on the light. And then? And then I ran. Immediately? Yes. Why didn't you clean up the evidence? Because... Because... Because... Because... Carry on, I'm in a hurry. You came to steal... ...you found a body, and you ran away. - That's your plan for the defence? - I don't know. I didn't kill her. We don't have a plan, it's the truth. Dear Sir, I'm not as gullible as a juror! Your attitude is intolerable! Please calm down, I'm in a hurry. - M. le juge, can I leave? - Commissaire, ...do you have anything to ask M. Ferri?re? Not at the moment. - Off you go then. - Thank you. Let's get a move on. You can sit. Take these back for me. I'm not going to the office. I'm going to my dentist. Toothache makes them aggressive. - Au revoir, Commissaire. - Au revoir. So, a clear-cut case. So you think, Heurtin is guilty? Evidently! I'm afraid I disagree M. le juge. As you wish. It seems like a simple case of greed. Heurtin finds out she spends nights alone. He watches the villa, then goes in. - How does he get in? - It's up to you to.. ...answer that, Commissaire. Heurtin enters, He goes to her room. She cries out. He kills her. It's psychological, Heurtin is an opportunist, faced with a body, he loses his head, ...and flees without even robbing her. Her body slips and then falls. - Au revoir, Commissaire. - Au revoir. - But Heurtin isn't the killer. - Impossible. Who is it then? I don't know, but I'm looking. I'll leave the flights of fancy to you. You're drawing hasty conclusions from the facts. I don't need your opinions. - Stick to your job. - I've never left it. Do your job. Bring the guilty to the courts. And stop the courts from making mistakes. Resign then. Become a solicitor! So tell me my dear M?nard... Use the shortcut, it's less busy. Will do! He's a right one that juge d'instruction, eh boss? Youngster, you could show a little respect. So I'm supposed to respect him. As for respect, maybe you could stop constantly... ...reminding me I'm new. What are you gawping at? Louis XIV's country cottage? Cycle up here on Sundays with your friends then! What are your friends called? - I don't have any. - You don't have any? What do you do at the end of the day? - Twiddle your thumbs? - Play patience? Why no! You make gentlemanly calls.. ...to rich old ladies in empty houses? Even for that you need some friends! With a friend, it's more fun, eh Joseph? You can sing, hold hands and the dark isn't so scary. Leave me alone, I didn't kill her. Of course not, my sister did it! - Ah! - Are we stopping? - Engine trouble. - We'll see what it is. You have a meeting at 5. They'll be kept waiting then. Just because someone shows up late... ...is no reason to tear out what's left of their hair. - Do you have petrol? - I got 30 I this morning. - It's your sparkplugs then. - Crowd around me more! I'll get my key. Allez hop! Move your legs! Go on, move them! Shift them out the way! I've got them. Watch it! [I]I'll occupy the cops, run when I whistle - A Friend[/I] What's dripping? Petrol. She's done for. - No she isn't. - She is, look at that! Hurry up, unscrew them. You could have done that quicker with your teeth. - Don't lose him! - Yes boss. Call me, I won't leave the office. This takes a lot of guts boss. It needed to be done. - Well? - Take us to the station. You didn't see anything. Calm down, I've been doing this 15 years. Sir, Heurtin isn't a killer. - I'm sure of it. - Speculation! In spite of the evidence. Someone tricked Heurtin. Someone deliberately stacked up all the proof against him. Now he's free, he'll go and find that person. Lucas and Janvier are following him. And then we'll know. You're risking your job. We're risking a man's head M. le directeur. No sentimentality, Commissaire. Normally pity isn't a part of what we do, ...but this time I can't help it. It's for you. I'm on my way. That was Lucas. Heurtin is back in Paris. He is watching.. ...someone at Eden, in Montparnasse. He seems like he's watching someone in the back. We need to know who. He hasn't noticed that we're following. Stay on him for now. A beer and some ham! Won't you offer me a drink? No thanks, I'm not thirsty. The man behind me, ...is he a regular? - Yes. - You know him? He's there all day. He's a czech, used to study medecine. He couldn't continue, he's screwed. Tuberculosis or something. Yes. A yoghurt and a caf? cr?me: 4,50. No, no. Bring me a caviar sandwich. - I caviar sandwich! - No, 3 caviar sandwiches. 3! - 3 caviar sandwiches! - 3 caviar sandwiches? With vodka? With vodka and a pack of Abdullahs. Large ones. How much is that? It is... 30 for caviar, 6 for vodka, 25 for Abdullahs, ...plus 4,50, that makes: 65,50. Good. I'll pay you one of these days. One of these days? I'm getting the owner. Well then owner? You refuse to pay? I'm not refusing, I can't. I have no money. Well send someone home with you. I don't have money there either. Go find me a policeman. Your papers. Your papers. You are risking.. ...15 days in prison for vagrancy. Come on. Probation too. St?phane Radek. Born in Bur... Bour... Bou... - Brno. - "Breno"? Father unknown.. ...and mother is a domestic. What do you live on? - Aid from compatriots. - You don't work? I am ill. Do you have proof of residence? I live in h?tel Bellevue. - Rue Delambre? - Yes. A furnished room. - Are you pressing charges? - Yes. This happens too often. Very good. Sit down, you need to sign a complaint. Search him. What's that? What is it? What's the meaning of this? Look at that! Take it from that my friend. There you go. Au revoir, messieurs. - And the charges? - He paid. I'll drop them. Are you keeping my passport? We will return it after it's been checked. Good. Can I go now? Off with you! But if you try this again, ...you'll face charges for insulting the magistrature. - Understood? - Perfectly. Goodnight, messieurs. What nerve! - Follow that man. - Yes. If there's anything interesting.., - ...call me at the station. - Yes, boss. Oh... my feet are so swollen! Doctor? In 6 months, I will be dead. And the rest, ...they'll carry on, earning their dirty money. And you, ...you'll carry on walking the streets... for money. And me, I will be dead. They'll all treat themselves to: servants, baubles, cars, love. Don't go! No, but... you're crazy! Don't go! So why did you bring me up here then? I don't want to be alone. He hasn't moved boss. - A woman spent the night. - Good, I'll go and see him. - Stay over there. - Yes boss. If I leave without him, then follow him. - The room number? - 40, second floor. Thank you. Who is it? Police. Damn, it's the copper! Here is the passport. It's all in order. I didn't ask you anything. Get out of here! Thank you. Would you be kind enough to put it over there. Thank you. Good bye, then? What was the point of last night's charade? What charade? Your arrest. Intrigued are you? I am Commissaire Maigret. Excuse me, I took you for a mere inspecteur. I fancied a night in the cells. For a study I'm doing. Curious, picking... the night that someone's waiting outside for you. Someone was waiting? Who? Heurtin. Heurtin? Heurtin... The one who killed the old lady? In Versailles? The very one! I've heard about that.. ...from regulars in I'Eden. Ferri?re and his lover, ...I'm sure you know of them Commissaire, ...will inherit everything from old Mrs Henderson. Arthur! Bring me some milk. So, Heurtin was waiting for me. So he's on the loose? I read about his arrest after the crime. He escaped. Well I never! And you didn't snatch him up when you saw him? I'm shocked, Commissaire. Here is the milk. Here is an unrecognised genius, Commissaire. If you want information.. ...on anyone here, like me. Just ask him. Off you go my good man. Would you like some? No? Prefer a Pernod? I don't drink. # To know the embrace of love, to survive eternally, # # I encouraged the constraints and I left insanely. # # But I searched for the face, of the love I dreamed of, # # on every soul that passed by me # # and I didn't find it. And while living bitterly # # with the terror of being alone, in the crowd, # # which crushes me, like a lonely shroud. # Sings well, doesn't she? # Chasing the abyss # Mmm. Is she pretty? I don't know. Is she young? # of a love with no future. # I don't know her. I don't want to know her. Although really I do know her... # In a caress # ...from listening to her. # In tenderness # I put a body, ...and a face, # I met my destiny # ...to that voice. The face of... someone. # And the night invaded me # Women don't interest me. # all is mist, all is grey. # Except for one. # As I cradled my illusion # Want my advice? You're going wrong. # I knew that you had come # You let Heurtin go on purpose. You thought he'd lead you to his accomplice. There is an accomplice right? Don't forget the old saying: # ignoring my cries # ..."He who gains from it, did it." In this case, Willy Ferri?re. # only contempt on your lips # I know how he lives. We go to the same caf?. Ferri?re's been ruined by a demanding woman. # living bitterly # - Look no further. - Thank you. But... there is someone else. # In the crush of the crowd # Really? Who set it up from the start. And put the blame on a defenceless simpleton. Me? -Au revoir.. # In a caress, in tenderness # ...old chap. # I took back my destiny # # And the night invaded me # # all is mist, all is grey # Remember the Taylor affair, Commissaire? He was an American film director. He was murdered, 8 years ago in Hollywood. The Police knew the killer. Everyone knew the killer. He wasn't arrested. He never will be. The crime was so well done, ...that there was no proof. Don't be stubborn, Commissaire. You'd do better going fishing, or playing pool. - Boss! - What? The chief's been asking for you. - Ah? - It's not good. - What happened? - Well, we lost Heurtin. Get out of my sight, idiot! Come in! - At last you arrive! - Yes, I just learned... He slipped through our fingers boss. Because of your frivolity Maigret. A murderer has escaped justice. I am banning you from this case from now on. - Very good sir. - I hope for your sake that Heurtin is caught. But stay out of it. We have circulated his description. You there! Your papers! Halt! Your papers. Your papers. Your papers. You too, your papers. Papa! He took my food. Stop him! Don't let him escape! Stop him! Got him! - What's that? - That gentleman said.. ...to return this key to you. He told me you would understand. He is waiting for an answer. Very well. Make him wait. I'll call for you. What is it? "Agreed that for 100.000 francs." "We will rid you of your aunt Henderson." "Send the address, key, floor plan," "..to M. V. boulevard Raspail." How do you know that? You leave your papers lying around my poor dear. This one has guts. He kept his word. He knows you should have received the inheritance, ...and he's looking for his payment. Are you scared? Fear? Hmmm! No, but I don't understand. Heurtin, my aunt's killer was in prison. To get here, he must have escaped. No need to get upset about it! He served you well right? So pay him and it's all over. No, I don't want to see him. Well I want to. I will speak to him. Let me do it. Send him in. Yes madame, you know me. I drink caf? cr?me in I'Eden. You see me every day. M. Ferri?re is sorry. - He's asked me to... - I'm happy for it. M. Ferri?re agreed to pay 100000 francs.. ...to the one who, who turned him from, ...a potential beneficiary, to an actual one. This work was executed, ...I have come for the 100000 francs. - You are... - The killer of Mme Henderson. Joseph Heurtin, I believe. No. St?phane Radek. Heurtin is a bit-player. He didn't execute the plan. He was my cover. For every murder, the justice system needs a killer. I provided one for them. It's what you'd call: ...a perfect crime, mademoiselle. Where should M. Ferri?re send your cheque? Here. I will wait for him. I have time. That's it boss! Radek has just left. He has gone to 148 rue de Vaugirard. - Ferri?re's house? - Yes. - It becomes clear. - I left M?nard there. Let's go! Do you know that you're not lacking in courage? Thank you, madame. And if I called the police? I would have to tell a story, about certain letters.. ...sent to M.V. boulevard Raspail containing certain items. No... You'd be denouncing yourself. - Pff! - You don't care if you live? It's life that doesn't care for me. I am ill. Terminally. I have 6 months to live. So it's all one to me. Just one thing matters. You never asked yourself why I did it? Money, the 100000 francs, I laugh at it. In 6 months I'll be in a communal grave. No... I wanted to do something grand. I hated you, you and your lover. You had everything, and I had nothing. You, that I saw each day, with your jewels and furs and cars... So, I waited for my chance. That would put me in charge. I knew it would come. And it came. Now I am in charge. Both of you are in my power. You are beautiful. You must love me as well. An account of our crime, is in a safe place. If I do not return in 48 hours it will go to the police. It's not enough. Why not? A man like me cannot suddenly start... ...spending money overnight. The police would wonder. And if the police wonder... But Ferri?re's friend, is above suspicion. No one would reproach you, for taking a liking to me. So, from now on, Radek is Ferri?re's friend. You understand? You will introduce me to your relatives. I have been alone too much. - You are mad! - Do you think so? You crook! Monsieur, ...a gentleman wishes to see monsieur. Come in, Commissaire. What good timing. My friend Ferri?re was telling the funniest story! Monsieur. You wanted to see me M. Maigret? - Am I bothering you? - Not at all. Sit down, please. Will you have a drink, monsieur? I would prefer to have someone. There is a point that.. ...the investigation did not follow through. The key to the Henderson villa, used by the killer. Do you have one? No, monsieur. Ah, ah! I mean... yes. Yes, yes I do! Your aunt gave it to you herself? - Yes, monsieur. - Why? For err... simply put, ...my aunt had been very ill for some months. Yes. She gave me that key so I could visit her at any time. - Yes, so you had that key? - Yes certainly. But I don't know where I put it. - Isn't it this one? - Pardon? Yes it is. It is that one. Commissaire, you are pitiless. You should relieve that poor inspecteur... ...from his post. He's been following me... ...since last night. He's dead on his feet. He must be cold. Brrr! So you know M. Radek? Well yes. I did a small favour for M. Ferri?re. Ah... It was... - It was recent? - Oh yes. Monsieur! - Hey, monsieur... - M?nard. Monsieur M?nard! Come up.. ...warm up a bit! Oh my, if I had known you were... Come in, Janvier. Bonjour, monsieur M?nard. A glass of port! Forgive me for making you walk around this morning. Even in the cold it's not disagreeable. And then I gave you that rare feeling: of the hunter. Take off your coat. One small criticism. I had to wait for you at the crossing. Thank you. If you don't mind dear Lady. Here we are, all together. It would be a shame, to be separated too soon. I have a proposition for you my dear Ferri?re. Thanks to the intelligent work of these gentlemen, ...your aunt's killer will soon be behind bars. I think you owe them a meal. - And me too. - It's only fair. - Don't you think so darling? - But... certainly. - Will you accept Commissaire? - Yes, with pleasure. Thank you, madame. - Excuse me. - Madame. Pardon. Excuse me for a moment. And then a night club, my treat. You are lucky, Willy. Because you are lucky. Right? The old lady's death. And the millions that follow. At the very moment.. ...when you couldn't even pay.. ...poor old Bob, the barman here at I'Eden. You are the mascot. The charm. The talisman. The rabbit's foot. Drink. 2 glasses. Listen... I live opposite. You'll come with me, right? Leave them here. You will come. Leave me alone! You will come. Or spend a night in the clink. I'll tell all. The crime. Your complicity. Everything. So... You won't say anything? He's pinching your woman, ...and you're saying nothing! There we are! You must be kind. And then everthing will be alright. Radek will pay you. You couldn't know, but my life starts tonight. And in a few months... But I don't want to die. I want to live, for you. With you. I've been waiting a year for this moment. One year of seeing you each night in I'Eden. And... And... I waited, for Radek's time. It's... Radek, right? It's Radek that you sent to Mme Henderson? You needed money. Hmm? You don't want to answer? You will come with me to the station. Your voice. I had nothing of you. So I imagined that that was your voice. I put your image to the woman's voice, ...she lives there, and I don't know her. Every time I imagined that you sang for me, for Radek. Poor Radek! Enough with that racket! We can't sleep. # His caress, his tenderness, # # I reached my destiny. # # And the night, # # invaded me. # # All is mist, all is grey. # # And the night invaded me, # # all is mist, # # all is grey. # Madame, M.
