The elderly and handicapped need ... The parliamentary election may end in political chaos ... According to the latest polls ... Welcome to "Politics Today." The Progress Party has ... MOST PEOPLE LIVE IN CHINA The government party has lost five points ... The election won't be easy this year, Lasse. I've always voted Labor, just like my dad. But Right is such a nice word. Easy to pronounce. The right-hand turn is easiest, after all. But you can't vote for a party just because it's easy to pronounce. And the Left has moved so far to the right- - that you can't really call them Left anymore. And the Center Party? Who am I to stand in the way of progress? You can't stop filling the tank when it's only half-full. The Socialist Left is hopeless, but they do have some good ideas. And the Progress Party actually isn't that bad either. The Christian People's Party. You can be damn sure I won't vote for them! -What do you say, Lasse? -I have other plans for tomorrow. BACK SOON Most People Change -I like sky blue. -I have two potential boat partners. A light color. -Royal blue, maybe? -Wooden boats take a lot of work. And we need heating cables. I hate cold floors. It's too warm in here. But they say softer colors are better in large bathrooms. Maybe we can sail to Denmark this summer? Then again, marble looks nice with blue tiles. Checkered tiles on the floor ... Want to go for a swim? A swim? Go right ahead. Are you up for a swim, August? What the hell? Cecilie? Cecilie? Cecilie? Hello? I just went for a swim, and my clothes were ... You have to call the police. Do you have a phone? Outside. Thanks. Give me my jacket! It's him! He's the one that took my clothes! Are you all right? Easy now! How about coral blue? Wouldn't that be elegant? Maybe it's just the name. Coral blue sounds so exotic. But a light color would probably be best ... Hi. Another package? This one is huge. -Bye! -Bye. Some People Miss Home This is a great location. If ever a waterfall could sell a deodorant ... I just got another call. Talk to you later. Hello? Hi! Let me check. We need fresh asparagus. And eggplant. I'll be home well before that. I just got hungry. I need something right now. I love you too. Are these fresh? They're good until Tuesday. Were packed last night. Hello? No way! -I'm having guests. I can't! -Want me to heat it up? Do I have to go up there just because the client ... But I found a waterfall! Arild's parents are coming to dinner and I head to Stockholm tomorrow. I would have heard about that waterfall. Send someone else. Around nine. I'll be home by nine. Dammit, can't you receive them without me? They're your parents! OK. Bye. Help me! That cow ate my Communicator. My cell phone. It ate my cell phone. You want us to try to pull it out? It can't have come far. -Was it waterproof? -Huh? -Was your Communicator waterproof? -I don't know. But I have to have it. A cow has four stomachs. Figure 3-4 hours per stomach ... It should be out again around this time tomorrow. I can't wait till tomorrow. I have to have it now! This is the cow! No it isn't! It's a different one! I'm hungry. Where am I? You're home. I can take over. You go eat lunch. Hi. Has another package come in? -A long one. -I can check. -Bye! -Bye. As much as I want. Bread, butter, cookies, chocolate ... Thank you, God, for listening to me. Thank you for my pants and shoes. Thank you, God. I will never forget to thank you. Want me to drive? Why don't you relax? We're in Norway now. He's so cute when he's asleep. Most People Want Family Is that everything? No, I think ... Let me have a lighter. Torill? Line? Line? Did you let him out? Ilie? Ilie? Ilie! -Have you seen a young boy? -How old? -Seven. -Eight. He has to be here somewhere. Unless someone has taken him. Did you see that man in there who bought all that candy? -We have to call the police! -What should we tell them? -We're going to lose him. -We've already lost him! Hello? I just wanted a cigarette. I thought he was asleep. We should never have done this. What do you mean? Just that! We can't take care of him. -Have you searched everywhere? -He's nowhere. -What kind of a car was it? -Blue. -How old is the boy? -Eight. -And his name? -Ilie. Ilie? Like the Romanian tennis player. Nastase. And his last name? We were passing through Romania on our way from Italy ... He kept following us. He chose us, in a sense. We couldn't leave him. We have contacted a lawyer, and we have some documents ... -You brought him from Romania? -Once the paperwork is ... We couldn't leave him there on the street. He would die. He doesn't care that we're two women. Excuse me. Ilie, honey! -Is he OK? -Yes, I think so. He hasn't said a word. I drove off, and suddenly I saw him in the rearview mirror. He ruined my cake, by the way. Which one of you is his mother? -I am. -I am. I mean ... I guess I'm the father. In a sense. How can I regain control? I always end up in back. And how about love? Can you push love? Most People Need Company I packed my trunk with ... C. Competition, capital, cash flow. Companion ... crackers ...? This is too much. We agreed never to go there. They are our competitors! They were , Albert. Competitor, creditor, corruption, corrosion, collision, crone ... Is anyone here? Hello? These damn people! They may have condoms and dog biscuits, - - but can they help you when your car breaks down? No! I just said it to his face: I don't love you anymore. I sensed it when he kissed me. Be better off kissing a two-by-four. -What's going on? -There's no one there. -Sure there is. -Help me open the hood. Should you say what you think? -Where's the coil? -I have no idea. There is no coil here. What's the problem? I can't get it started. It just coughs. -Let me hear. -You know anything about engines? He wants me to be honest. Am I too honest? -What do you think? -You have any spare spark plugs? There's no spark. -He doesn't turn me on. -Sex is important. To begin with my heart pounded at the sight of him. -You have to listen to your engine. -Where's the oil pump? Down here. It leads the oil into the lubricant channels. It cleans out dust and soot and passes through the filter ... -I don't know why it didn't work out. -You're all set. I still think he's the one for me. Theoretically. No, it isn't easy. Easy? Is it supposed to be easy? An engine can't run without oil. But clean the plugs, and you can fire it up again. I'm very fond of him. It's impossible to be in love the entire time. My God, are you still in your pajamas? -Hang on. -Who wants a caffe latte? This will keep you warm. Not bad, huh? Here's a caffe latte. Hope you like it. Thank you. You can fire up the engine now. -Are you going to dump him? -No, I'm going to adapt. Come on, girls! -Bye. -Thanks for the help. Have a nice trip! Hello? Lasse? Hello? This is a Tiger Moth! Look what I found. -Aren't you going to open it? -Sure. Where did you get this? My dad bought it when I was a kid. It was a pile of junk, but we started working on it. We worked on it every spare hour dad had. Even on Christmas Eve. Can I sit in it? Sure, but don't touch anything. Wow! That's the passenger seat. Some People Are Blind -Want to buy a lottery ticket? -Maybe I will. What does the money go to? Some of it is for blind kids in Africa. Some is so that I can get a guide dog. So I don't walk into walls all the time. I'm sorry. I'll buy a couple. -How much are they? -50 kroner. 50 kroner? Isn't that a little steep? Fine. 5.50 per ticket, or four tickets for 20 kroner. There you go. I'll take four. -Did I win? -No. -How about this one? -No. -This one? -No. -How about this one? -No. Well, well. Good luck! Want to buy a lottery ticket? Want to buy a lottery ticket?! -Can I win? -Sure. Nothing. Not a thing! I've had enough of this, Tarald. You can pack up. -How much do we have? -Let's see. 200, 320 ... 20, 40, 60, 80 ... 453 kroner. Thank you. Wasn't that money for blind kids in Africa? -No point. It would just disappear. -You said you were sending it. There's no point. Africa's a mess. Right, Tarald? I hear it's pretty messy down there. I didn't give you money so you could buy candy. -How many tickets did you buy? -Three. -You can have your money back. -What about the others? They aren't here, are they? No, but most people don't like being tricked. Most people live in China. Right, Tarald? That's what dad says. What about all the blind kids in Africa? Even if they had been here, they wouldn't have seen anything. -You think they're happy down there? -I know they're warm. It isn't their fault they were born in Africa. It isn't my fault I was born here. And I'm as blind as they are. And what good would it do to send 453 kroner down to millions of kids? 453 divided by millions ... You do the math. -I don't know what to say. -Why don't you just do your job? There. That's all you can afford. This is more than enough. That's right. Tarald wants to get dad a birthday present. You'll have to put back the big milk chocolate, Tarald. -What did you want to get your dad? -Something for his car, right? Something for 30 kroner? I don't know ... -Gas. -Gas? We'll take gas. This will make dad happy, Tarald. That makes 450 kroner. You get 3 kroner back. Happy now? Strange. What's the problem? I think I'm going to have to refer you to a specialist. So I can't drive home? Drive? Are you crazy? You can't see a thing. Lasse? Hi, Lasse. Lasse? We don't have all day! Most People Need Love There's a cow here. A cow. Hurry up! I was only paid to baby-sit you for two hours. This is the last time. I've told you a hundred times before: No cups on my dashboard! I want clean surfaces. A good design. She's here today too. FREE CAR WASH if we forget to ask And today we're going to trick her. Mommy! -You want anything? -Nice surfaces. Good design. Those are nice too. Your uniforms, I mean. You know what else is nice? Your latest campaign. A hot dog with relish, a large soda, and a muffin. I'll take one of those. You think you've figured our campaigns out? Think you save money? Cool. A suction cup. What the hell is that? A coffee cup. It keeps your coffee warm, and it's on sale. You'll have to excuse my buddy. He's not into design, clean surfaces. He cares more about little toys from Japan. Poke... Poke-your-mom ... Pokémon! This is Pikachu. The thing is, what many people don't know ... They think he's this cuddly, sweet little character. But actually he has special, magical abilities. He has gone through three stages of training. Kind of ... Kind of like me. What am I doing? Hate to mess up a place that's into such nice ... design. You know what they do here? They take advantage of people. And make me serve customers like you. That's the magic. Stage two. It looks like you have to pay. I'm broke. You're broke every time. Isn't he cute? Don't do it, Finn. It isn't fair. Why do you care about him? To understand injustice, you have to identify with the exploited. It's called empathy. Something I'm sure you've never heard of. What the chick with the nice tits means, - - is that you have be stupid to understand an idiot. Mess with him one more time, and ... Just pay and leave. 150 kroner. Don't pay for him. FREE CAR WASH if we forget to ask You forgot. Finn tried to make a move on that mulatto Negro chick. Yeah, great body. I got pissed, so I sent him through the car wash. He's in there crying. Hi. Hi, it's you. Your cup. Is this the third stage? Does something magic happen now? I don't know. He looks like a Playmo character. Flat hair. No, I don't think he'll ever look like he's just been fucked. Bye. -Get out. -Hey there! Do your eyes hurt? No. How's the Tiger Moth? Almost done. Lasse? A friend of mine just taught me a new recipe. Want to come to dinner? Chinese. Lasse? Lasse? Some People Are Lost You've never been to my job before, Martin. -I was looking for you. -Poor you. -Where were you? -At work. I was there. They said you had taken the day off. They say so many strange things. -Ever met any of my colleagues? -No. One is a patient of yours. A young boy with a tattooed neck. I don't know him. Do you know my name? Your name? -Tuva. -Right. Tuva. I was there. I thought I'd surprise you. Please you. How long have we been married? I wanted to surprise you. You've never been to my job before. -Where are you headed? -Fredrikstad. To your cabin? Yes, actually. Where a mistress 15 years younger than you, awaits you. -What do you do for a living? -I'm a doctor. Doctors are the most self-absorbed ass-kissers around. I work with AIDS patients, so I don't kiss many asses. -How old are you? -18. -What are you laughing at? -Was I laughing? I was just thinking about being 18. -What about it? -It's cute. Cute? -My dad's a doctor. -Excuse me? And an idiot. My father was also a doctor. We he also a self-righteous, reactionary idiot? I don't know. He was very sick toward the end. Everyone gets sick in this society. Why bother being a doctor? Why not try helping society instead? No thanks. -Do you have a girlfriend? -Why do you ask? What's her name? -Tuva. -Tuva? What about her? Are you sure she's right for you? That you're right for her? There's nothing I can do. How did you get like this? You don't believe in anything. What do you know? Don't start getting any ideas! -Think you can perform noble deeds? -At least I haven't given up. Don't make me laugh. What the hell is the meaning of this? Martin? Try not to ... What? ... steal my car. Most People Don't Care They provided force and power When battling day and night Victory will follow our banners! Workers of the world - unite! Hi. Long time no see. -Are you all here? -We lost a few over the winter. -So I heard. Torbjørn? -Yes. -Prostate? -Yes. And Henrik. Henrik too? Yes. Overnight. -And Reidar. -Reidar too? And Gunnar and Hans and ... -Halvdan passed on at Christmas. -He was just a kid. 82. What is it they say? Only the good die young. That's right ... I'll have a green one. I have it right here. -Is that the right one? -Yes. Here you go. -Bye. -Have a nice trip! ... young and filled with hunger Slaved on other men's soil Without a word - but no longer! A winter without mercy Covered our naked land. Then a new spring dawned For both woman and man. There was a time when men, Young and filled with hunger, Slaved on other men's soil Without a word - but no longer! A winter without mercy Covered our naked land. Then a new spring dawned For both woman and man! Hello? You've been standing there a half-hour, Bjørn. You'd think I'd been drinking powdered milk. Hello? Help! Hello? Shit! Hello! -Are you all right? -I'm sinking. -Sinking? -Yes, I'm sinking. -It seems firmer here. -Hang on. We're coming! Thank you! Don't mention it. -Bye. -Bye! -Cute girl. -She sure was. It feels good to be able to help someone. Say what? He said: It feels good to be able to help someone. -She has her whole life ahead of her. -Say what? He said: She has her whole life ahead of her. I don't know about you fellows, - - but I seem to be stuck. Me too. That's unfortunate. Say what? They're saying they're stuck, and that's unfortunate. So am I. Unfortunately. I'm sure someone will come by. Say what? We'll just have to be patient. I'm sure someone will come by. Someone will come by. Eventually. What do you think, boys? What is there to think? How about a song? Good idea. Maybe someone will hear us. Say what? -Let's sing a song. -Good idea. Yes, good idea! Arise ye workers from your slumbers Arise ye prisoners of want For reason in revolt now thunders And at last ends the age of cant. Away with all your superstitions Servile masses arise, arise We'll change henceforth the old tradition And spurn the dust to win the prize So comrades, come rally And the last fight let us face The Internationale unites the human race So comrades, come rally And the last fight let us face The Internationale unites the human race! No thanks. Lasse? NOT BACK SOON Subtitles: Nick Norris
