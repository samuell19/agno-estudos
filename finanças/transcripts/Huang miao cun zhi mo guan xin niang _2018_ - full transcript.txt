"The Ghost Marriage of Huangmiao Village" I killed someone. I killed someone. I didn't kill anyone. Stay away. I didn't kill anyone. I didn't... Tell me, what do you see? Photos. So many photos. A run-down house. It's so dark... A run-down house? He's there. He's waiting for me. A-Mei. A-Mei! A-Mei! A-Mei. After hypnosis, the patient seemed to experience the same as when she sleepwalked... but why are we unable to find the source of her sleepwalking? With regard to that... I must reiterate the pathological reasons behind sleepwalking. Qiao Xi, turn on the lights. Qiao Xi, turn on the lights. Tell us, why are we unable to find... this pathological cause despite so many hypnosis attempts? Me? My view is that... in her dreams... she wants to kill her closest friend. What does that say? The only thing that says is that... this is someone... she shouldn't be friends with. Sleepwalking, in the neurological field, is a sleeping disorder. The most common symptom is to walk around in the house in a half-awake state... but some patients may leave the house and engage in dangerous actions or violent activities. Will they really kill? It's possible. Many sleepwalking patients are unable to distinguish between their illusions and reality. This not only affects their lives, but endangers others as well. There are many destabilizing factors. So... finding the cause of sleepwalking is the basis of the treatment. Now... let's go back to the case study. In the previous sessions, we focused only on filming A-Mei and neglected an important detail in the patient's subconsciousness. Look. Do you notice anything? There is no supernatural photo in this image. The photo only exists in her dreams. Based on her description, she saw many torn wedding photos. In medical terms, it's called "learned helplessness". This is when a patient recognizes their loss of control in the presence of aversive stimuli, accepts this helplessness and develops a lack of motivation to escape or avoid it. Based on our analysis... the best solution is cognitive-behavioral treatment through role play... that is, to place the patient in a setting similar to that in her dreams to help her regain awareness of her reality. However... this currently seems to be an impossible task. Professor... the beauty in the photo... I mean, the goddess... no, the patient, did she recover? Professor, who do you think can complete this impossible mission, you or A-Tang? All right... this is all for today. Class dismissed. Finally. Let's go. -A-Mei. -Wait for me. -Yes. -Stay for a minute. Yes. A-Mei... there is something I must tell you. Lin Yin... Didn't you say you just have to find the cause of the illness? It's not that simple. I need your help. Whatever you say, Professor. Hey, me too. I can work with you too. Give us a minute. Do you think... the Professor made me your bodyguard this time... to get us together like the Old Man Under the Moon? Eat the orange and shut up. Why is the peel... The peel... It's good too. Is the Old Man Under the Moon real? Of course. Why wouldn't he be? If he was... I'd like to meet him. You will soon. Christmas is coming. Are you stupid? What are you talking about? Isn't he the same as Santa? Lin Yin, just ignore him. Do you feel better now? I'm fine. What's wrong? Lin Yin. Lin Yin. Damn. This is so run-down. How is this livable? Cut the crap. Get the luggage. I'll take this. Let's go. All right... I know you need me. I'll take all the luggage. Come on. Let's go, Lin Yin. Watch out. Hello. Hello. Wait for me. Hello. -Hello. -Let's go. Be careful. What are you looking at? So pretty. Do you not feel well? Let's go to our rooms. Come on. Come. I'm here. Where are they? "Happy wedding" My goodness. A-Mei! Listen... just now... inside... That... It... That...You...You know, right? Do you understand? What? -Move. -You aren't... Where am I staying? You both have rooms. Where... am I staying? Wait, you... This is such a dump. Getting treatment here? This is madness. It's more likely to make people sick. That's...That's impossible. This is strange. Everything will get better. Will I get better too? A-Mei! A-Mei! A-Mei! What are you yelling for? Were you... inside all along? Yes. Why? Spit it out. My luggage was in the hall. Why is it here now? And the lanterns. This is strange. Maniac. Are you even awake yet? A-Mei! What? This is for you. Don't try this with me. No, it's a silver bracelet to ward off evil. Look... I have one too. Here, for you. Anything else? No. -A-Mei! -I... One last thing. I have an idea... but... Spit it out. It's... Can we... share a room? What are you thinking about? No, A-Mei, what I mean is, my... my room is... -It's more gloomy. -Get lost! -Wait, A-Mei, listen. -Get lost! I... That's not what I meant. What the hell is this? True love in adversity. Oh, most pernicious woman. My goodness. What is all this? A-Mei! A-Mei... Open the door, A-Mei! A-Mei! I just fell asleep. So white so big. I mean, I'm scared. I was all alone over there. Let me in first. I'll let you stand outside my door, but you can't come in, understand? Yes. No, I don't! A-Mei! I can see it... but I can't touch it. I will get you sooner or later... and smother you in my hands. Who is it? Who is there? Amitabha... Bless me... Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Where are you, Tan Hui? Tan Hui? Is it you? Tan Hui? Where are you? Come out and see me. I know it's you, Tan Hui. Tan Hui. Where are you, Tan Hui? Come out and see me. Tan Hui. Tan Hui. Tan Hui. I know it's you, Tan Hui. It's been three years. Shush. You scared me. You scared me. Drop the act. Come... Shush. It's been three years. Let me take a good look at you. Lin Yin! Lin Yin! Come on, help her up. Be careful. Come on. -Lin Yin. -Lin Yin. Lin Yin. Lin Yin. Is she still alive? -Professor. -Professor. When did you get here, Professor? What should we do now? In the last half month... she already fainted twice... without me waking her. Now, she is going to be confused between fantasy and reality... and she won't recognize that you are her friend. She won't even be able to take care of herself. Isn't it... worse than death then? Then... Then she... Professor... I've known you for three years... and I've never seen you smoke. I need both of your help. Whatever you say, Professor. There is a person... in her dreams. It is the part that is missing in the wedding photos. Photos. Wait for me. Are you saying... we need to enter her dreams... and interact with her there? Then we can wake her, right? Where am I? She's awake. Lin Yin. Come on... Let's get you back to your room. Be careful. Come on. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Here is your medicine. Why did you stick your chopsticks like that? It's like food for the dead. Come on. A freshly cooked drumstick. Here. A-Mei, try this. Eat your food. Do you think I will get better? Yes. The Professor promised me. What did he promise you? None of your business. Let's eat... The greatest bliss in this world is eating, especially with A-Mei. Will I see him again? Who? The person in your dreams? I mean, the Professor. Of course the patient would want to meet her doctor. Plus, we will be leaving this hellhole after tonight. Can't you even shut up with all this food? Will we be together then? Hey... don't you think the Professor has gone overboard? Why is she getting worse and worse? I noticed something. This clock keeps striking... yet, the hands never moved. Even a broken clock will tell the right time twice a day. Don't keep scaring yourself. Be good. Happiness comes so suddenly. If you like my cooking, I can cook for you every day. All right? Do you have nails, boss? How many inches? The bigger, the better. Too small. That's all I have. How many do you need? Eight. Eight? To nail a coffin with? Good baby. I'll take you home tomorrow. Come on, let's go to bed. Come. Come. Heavens above... by the ancestors' blessing. Heavens above... by the ancestors' blessing. Today, we will be wed as husband and wife. May we forget the past... and let it go. Heavens above... by the ancestors' blessing. Today, we will be wed as husband and wife. May we forget the past... and let it go. The auspicious hour is here. Year Bingshen, month Gengzi, day Dingchou, hour Rizi. Bow to the earth and heaven. Bow to the parents. Bow to each other. From now on, you will be as one, both in life and death. To the bridal chamber. Professor. Will she... be recovered tomorrow? Professor. Leave first. I'll take care of the rest. But it's so cold. -Will she... -I told you... I will take care of it. Professor... there is something I don't know if I should say. Then don't say it. Professor, what you are doing... -Let's go. -Wait. I quit. I can't wait on him any longer. Why didn't you let me finish? Is he the only one who can speak now? I quit! I'm sorry. I can't watch you suffer. He's waiting for me. He's waiting for me. I can't see his face. What is going on? Tan Hui. Damn it. I can't start the car. Hold on. What's wrong? Wait. What happened to your hand? What's going on? There is no wound. Where did the blood come from? What are you doing? What is this? A-Mei... come to Tan Hui's and my wedding tonight. Lin Yin. Qiao Xi... come to Tan Hui's and my wedding tonight. Lin Yin. It's fine now. Sit tight. Be careful. A-Mei. Wait for me. I'll get a light. All right. Qiao Xi, this isn't the time for games. Run! Why is your hand so cold? Open the door! A-Mei! Oh. You scared me, woman. A-Mei? Why are the lights turning on? A-Mei. A-Mei. A-Mei! A-Mei. Lin Yin. Lin Yin, are you still here? Lin Yin, don't scare me. We are only doing this... to help you get well. Come out if you are awake. Professor. Professor. Lin Yin. A-Mei! A-Mei. A-Mei. A-Mei. Lin Yin? Lin Yin? Is it you? A... A-Mei. Why are you doing this? Living people can't attend my wedding. You killed A-Mei. Do you love her? If you do, why don't you join her? Dying is like a candle going out. Tan Hui won't come back. You're back. Why did you kill them? They are innocent. What about me? This is the only way... to free you from this mental suffering. Tan Hui and you are separated by life and death. You are living like a zombie. Am I wrong? You are. My beloved is here. Lin Yin, you can't let him go even in death. Look at yourself. You are Tan Hui. Lin Yin, I'm sorry. Lin Yin. Bow to the earth and heaven. I solemnly promise to be together, even in death. Bow to the parents. To be together on the bridge to the netherworld. Bow to each other. Leave everything behind outside the netherworld. To the bridal chamber. Never again utter words of parting. "Ancestral virtues remembered through time" Have a dumpling. There is major hemorrhage in the brain. You should be prepared. You are watching over a vegetable. Have you ever considered your own future? He's awake. Tan Hui is awake. Look here. This is a miracle. To be honest, all his vital signs were fading, but his brain activity stayed strong throughout this period. From what we can see, he's very likely to regain feeling, physically. Congratulations. Possessiveness is an inherent human weakness, just like the story of Oedipus, as told by Freud. Are you possessive, Professor? I am human. I can be possessive too. Yes, she is my patient... but I must take responsibility for the child. I believe I can cure her. She is almost recovered. You must consider your own future. She is a patient. You can't break the rules of the field. This wedding gown that you speak of... isn't it just a simple dress? Why do all men like this? So unreliable. It's already late. Why isn't he here yet? Listen, a doctor marrying his own patient is the most insecure thing ever. Is he really not coming? Hey. Hello? Lin Yin, I'm at the door. I'm here. Guanting Wedding Photography is 100m ahead. Turn left. Searching for a carpark nearby. Lin Yin. Lin Yin. Don't cry now. Isn't this the day you've been waiting for? Do you have a makeup bag? I don't want to see him like this. Are you trimming his nails? All his stats are normal. He should be able to trim them himself soon.
