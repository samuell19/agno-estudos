Subtitles by explosiveskull Where's Jotham? Calm yourself boy. You've had your turn. He will join you presently. Why not kill us with the rest of them? When you catch a beast, you hang it up to tan. Examples must be made. Get back here. Longinues! Longinus! Dismas? Dismas? You look like an angel. Where are your brothers? Where are we? Shh... It's okay, mother. We're home, in the stable. You've been sleeping. Aram is right here. And Jotham? He sat by your side all night. Oh my sweet boys, you truly are my angels. Father should have been here. Your father will return to us. It's been months! Dismas, your father, he's a good man. He may be a man, but he isn't good. Jehovah would have you forgive. I will never forgive him. He left us. He left us to go get drunk all the time. Not everyone deserves forgiveness. Let's try here. What is it? Brother, tell me, do you have any rooms for the night? You are out of luck, my friend. We've been overbooked for days. It's the census! Sir, my wife, she is with child. She's about to give birth. Surely you can make some... Boy! There is no room for you, or your wife. You will have to make camp on the hillside with the other late arrivals. It's okay, God will provide. Sir! We have some room in the stables. A stable? Yes sir. I tend the stable for Mister Piram so he lets us stay there. You are very kind, what is your name? Dismas. And this is my brother Jotham. Hello, Jotham. Hello. Joseph... There is not much time. We must hurry, you lead the way. Mother, this is Joseph and Mary. They had nowhere to go. I had to help them. She's going to have a baby. I can see. Of course we'll help. This is my mother. She's unwell, but can still help. Are you sick? Nothing to fear. I had a child of my own not too long ago. I have yet to fully recover. Your boy, Dismas, he's a generous host. He's a good boy, my blessing from Jehovah. Today, Serah, he is a blessing to us as well. Oh! Bethlehem. The town of David. We have arrived. He's beautiful, Mary. He's perfect. What will you call him? His name is Yeshua. Yeshua. Salvation. It's lovely. Mother, go lie down. I can take care of our guests. Oh, you're so manly. Allow me to help you. It's the least I can do to repay your kindness. Come on. Here is fine. Serah, may God's grace abound to you for all you've done for my family and me. Shalom. Shalom. You have done so much for us tonight, Dismas. I pray one day we can repay you and your family if you are ever in a time of need. Your father would be very proud of you, Dismas. I don't speak of my father. Why? Why don't you speak of your father? He was not a good man. All men fall short, Dismas. That's why we must depend on Jehovah for forgiveness. You think everyone deserves forgiveness? I don't think anyone deserves forgiveness. That's why they call it forgiveness. You and I, we need forgiveness, too. I'll see what's going on. Shalom. How may I help you, sirs? We are sorry to disturb you at this hour. We are weary from our travel and would like to rest for a few hours. Can you help us with our camels? There's no room. Yes, yes, yes. But we just need to rest for a couple of hours. We have very important things to do tomorrow. I'm sorry sirs, but we're full. Boy. It's too cold for us to sleep outside. Kindly move your animals, and we will... Melchior... will pay you handsomely. It's not the animals, sir. A woman had a baby here tonight. May we see this child? Could this be? We've traveled so far. I am Melchior, my friend Balthazar and Gaspar. Am I a fool or is this the foretold messiah? You are no fool. The birth of our son was foretold to us by a messenger of Jehovah. Behold the King of Kings. What have you named him? Yeshua. We bring you gifts from afar. I bring you gold. A rare treasure for such rare child. I bring you frankincense, a gift for more than a king. A gift for a God. Behold. My gift to this special child is myrrh. Treasured oil, holy, for the anointing of kings and priests. Melchior! Matthias approaches! Herod lies! If we go back the way we came, he will have you killed. You paid our homage? I did. You were most generous. But masters, Herod is insane. At one mention of the prophecy, he flew into a rage. You are in great danger. As we feared. We have to go back home from a different route. Quietly. Agreed, but what of the infant Yeshua and his family? We cannot protect them. In fact, our constant presence endangers them. We must leave tonight. We must trust that God will protect this family. There is nothing we can do. Rise, Mathias. Go back to the camp. Order the servants to pack. We will follow you shortly. As you command, sir. What is it? It is Herod. We must return home to the east immediately. You are in danger as well. Please... protect the child. He is the best thing to happen to this world. I will. Thank you. One day you will understand the significance of what's happened here. Here. Take this. Use it to care for your family. Shalom, my brother. Shalom. Good morning, Jotham. Is it morning? How did we get here? That's easy. The Romans. The question is, how do we get out of here? We're not getting out of here. We need water. Can you show me to the nearest well? I'll come too. No, you need to go to sleep. I want to come. Fine. I'm tired. I told you to stay and sleep. I know, but I wanted to come with you. There it is. I'm going to walk Jotham back. All right, I will take it from here. My foot hurts. Let me see. Do not be afraid. Messenger of Jehovah. Why do you return to me? I bring a message. Take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt. To Egypt? Herod is filled with fear. He knows for what purpose the child was born. Even now he seeks out the child to kill him. For how long must we go? Travel quietly. Tell no one. Remain there until I bring word that it is safe. Follow the guiding of Jehovah. You will be protected. I will. I will. That wasn't for us to see. Do you understand? Let's go. The arrogance! I want them found! I want the magi brought to me so I can kill them myself! How dare they defy me! Was I not a gracious host to allow them to travel the kingdom? You were most honorable, my Lord. Did I not accept their measly tributes? Yes, you did. And I let them to continue their journey. I endorsed them, even. And all I asked was for them to return to me and report their findings. They betrayed you. Find them, and bring them to me. My Lord... There is something far more dangerous than these three old men. This false prophecy. Let me go into Bethlehem and find this child and bring him to you. We will show the people that you are the wisest of them all. I am the wisest of men, much wiser than the Magi. Let them go, Castor. They mean nothing to me. But... bring me back the child. Yes, my Lord. I'll send my men now. Wait! Not yet, Castor. I'm growing weary of these people and their prophets. They do not understand the difficulty of being their king while Rome watches over my every move. No, if I am to break the grasp the Jews and the Romans have over me... I must crush this delusion once and for all. I don't understand, my Lord. Send your men to Bethlehem. And kill every male child under the age of two. The people will finally understand the madness of pursing this prophecy. By my lord, if I just bring the child to you, it'll be enough... If we kill just the one child, what will stop the people from simply saying that the messiah was another boy in town? No. No, I will not have it. Every single one of them, Castor. Do not miss even one. My lord. Castor... do not fail me. Yes, my lord. No! Mother! Mother! My angel. What happened? They came for... Aram. Where's Jotham? We need to find you help, mother! No. No. Run. Take your brother, and run. Go. Come on. We need to go. What is the meaning of this intrusion? Have you forgotten your manners? I need to speak with you, my lord. Leave us. Is the deed done? Yes. All the male children in Bethlehem are dead. All of them? All of them. Good. And what of the Magi? I didn't see them in the town, nor on the road. Treacherous fools. This business with the Magi must be dealt with. Have your scouts found nothing? I though we were going to let the Magi leave in disgrace. I've changed my mind. I want their heads, and I want them brought to me now. They must be punished. Where do you think they could have gone to, Castor? They probably fled to the mountains. And are the king's scouts unable to enter the king's mountains? The marauders own that land. If I sent my men in there, they'll be at risk... You are mistaken. I own those lands and they are my men to risk as I will. Find the Magi. My lord, their their false messiah is dead. They hold no threat to you. Do you think me weak, Castor? No, my lord. Was I not clear? I ordered them to report back to me when the child was found. Yes, my lord. They came to my lands... seeking a usurper to my throne, and spat in my face. Their continued existence is an affront to my rule. I would shed the blood of a third of my kingdom rather than suffer it a day longer! Find them! Dismas, my son. Look at the desert lily. See it? It grows in the harshest places on Earth, under the hot sun, where there are no streams, no rivers, no hope for living things. Where other plants wither, Jehovah provides a way, and so it survives, and in time, it blooms. Of all the ways to go... I would never have known you two would be the end of me. You should have left us alone, Abba. You shouldn't have put up a fight. Tiran was right no to to trust you. I thought maybe you'd gain some wisdom with age, but you're just as bad as when I met you. No, I am worse than when you met me. Stand. Who are you? I'm Dismas. Dismas. And how did Dismas come to be out here in the middle of nowhere? Are you aware that you're trespassing, boy? How? This is the middle of nowhere. The middle of nowhere. I'm Tiran. These are my men. This is my desert. Are you traders? We're distributors. We re-distribute wealth among fellow travelers. Oh. You understand what that means? It means... you're thieves! Look at every one of their faces, boy. These men here are from every far flung corner of the world, including my boy, Gestas, who grew up in the Mediterranean. Their left their past lives behind to make a better one here. You seem like a smart boy despite getting lost in the desert. So surely you realize who the true thieves are? The rich, who make a fortunes off the back of slaves, the tax collectors who pad their books with gold. Gold like this. Where does a desert rat like you get a coin like this? I found it. You're a liar. Oh, I hate doing this. Abba, the little one! Stop! Don't hurt him! I'll tell you how I got it! That's adorable. But if the next words out of his mouth aren't exactly where he got that coin, slit his delicate throat. Speak, rat. I stole it! We almost got caught, and that's why we're out here. Now, please, let my brother go! It takes on thief to know another, huh? You lifted a coin like this without getting caught? Can no one else be thieves but you? I'd like to meet the man that owned this coin. I'd imagine there's a lot more where this came from. Wouldn't you? Maybe. Maybe? How about this, boy? You take me to this man, and I won't cut your hands off for thieving? Rat. The Magi had lots of guards. They'll protect us. These raiders don't stand a chance. Are you sure? Yes. Well... pretty sure. I'm scared. I know, I am too. You are? Yes, but we have to be brave. Can you be brave with me? Yes. I can if you can. Good. Then do everything I say. It's Thomas. Thomas. Come on, Gestas. Give me good news, Thomas. There's a large caravan, all right. Little rat is telling the truth. They have dozens of soldiers. They work in shifts into the night. Either they're scared, or they have a lot to protect. Follow them 'til they make camp for the night, then circle back. We'll attack them by surprise. Yes, sir. Take Gestas with you. It's time this little scoundrel learned how to scout a camp properly. I'll keep him safe. Safe? How's he supposed to learn anything if he's safe? Where is it? That is it. That is all we have. That's all you have? Is that why you have a tent fit for a queen and an entire pack of guards looking after your back? We are just simple travelers traveling through this... I know exactly who you are and where you've traveled. Your friends here already shared that. Now, I'm going to ask you one more time, Magi. Where's the rest of it? You are correct. We are Magi. But there's no more riches. Stop! Please. I'll tell you everything you want to hear. Finally there's a smart man here! Please, enlighten me. When we crossed the border into Herod's territory, his men came to us and demanded that we pay Herod's toll. His man Castor threatened to execute us. Castor. That wonderful occupier. To whom we are the resistance. I've crossed paths with Castor before. Yes. So, we paid quite a large amount as tribute, hoping that this would all be over, but it wasn't. Castor's men came back and robbed us of the rest of it. We made haste to the east, trying to escape from being robbed anymore. But the, well, um, you... robbed us. I haven't robbed you yet, because you won't tell me where the rest of it is. Dismas! Come here. Do you know these men? I cared for their livestock a few days ago. Is this the rat you caught stealing? I beg your pardon, almost caught. Of course. We thought he had escaped. I don't suppose you would let us keep him and his brother so that they may be punished? No. I'm growing quite fond of the little vermin. In fact, I think we'll keep them. As for you three... Drop your weapons now, or I kill the boy. This must be the incredibly simple Magi. You want to do it? Kill him. Mathias, let the boy go! I will do it! I will slit his throat! Release my masters now! Let him go! Don't harm him! Stand down, Abba. Let him kill him. Let my brother go! You are pathetic, sir. I believe you were just disarmed by a little boy. Stupid and incompetent. Two very unfortunate qualities. This is who you pick to be the captain of your guard? I thought Magi were supposed to be wise. Dismas. Come here. You see that man over there? The one we're holding? He was going to kill you. He was going to slit your throat. And now you're going to kill him. Take this sword. I can't. Yes you can! Thomas will hold him for you. I won't! Yes you will! Or Abba will take your brother's life! No! Stop! You stop. You stop. You're the only who can stop this. You're the one who determines what happens here. He was about to slit your throat. Do yo understand? Do it. Are you a coward? No. Then what are you waiting for? Do it! Now! Ladies, here are your spoils. Share them accordingly. Who's the one responsible for tying the poor man that got himself killed last night? I am, sir. Thomas. Oh, no. You need to learn to tie better knots, old man. You almost got Dismas killed on his first raid. Apologies, sir. Although, the little rat did gain much experience. Isn't that right, Dismas? I didn't think you'd do it. Did you think he would, Abba? No, sir. I think the time has come for you and your brother... to become permanent members of our family. Is that understood? Yes. Good. Then it's settled. But we do have one problem that we do need to address first. Your error almost got us killed. For practically nothing in return. You need to be punished. Gestas. Make me proud, son. Let me go! Jotham. You didn't have to. Don't ignore me. You know what I'm talking about. You gave me the sword! What was I supposed to do? We have always kept each other alive, through everything! You have always kept me alive. And how do I save you now brother? Looking good, brother. Good. Watch your footwork, Jotham. Sorry, brother. Keep your guard up, Dismas. The fight's never over. Come on, let's eat. Stop, thief! Guards! Longinus. It is fortunate to see you've returned in one piece. Thank you Legatus. And I take it you were successful? These barbarians have a penchant for dismembering those who insult their pride. Yes sir. The Atrebates will resume paying tribute at once. What's this one here for? Insurance. Very well. I have a new task for you, Longinus. Our Judean friends are having problems with brigands. Judea? The province is a festering... You forget yourself! Rome calls upon you to serve. Are you a servant of Rome? Yes, sir. Forgive me. For years these bands of marauders have terrorized the populace. They're questioning Rome's ability to keep her citizens safe. I selected you for this task because of how you put down the insurrection among these Celtic tribes! You will go to Judea, eradicate these savages and restore order! Is that clear? It will be done. What news of the caravan you're scouting? They look like merchants. Heavy laden wagons with only a few men. How many men? Nine or 10. Well is it nine or is it 10? Relax, Dismas. You're like an old woman these days. Relax, brother. There's only merchants, no guards. Gestas is right, you do worry like an old woman. Yeah, an old woman who can take either of you in a sword fight any day. So don't forget it? Gestas, do you think it's worth the risk? I do. Then we ride at dark. Gestas... you're in command of this one. Thank you, father. Come. Tell me of your strategy. How's the edge on that thing? Give it here. What are you so angry about? I'm not angry. Dismas... Dismas... All the men in this camp, they treat me like a man. Why can't you? Look, I know this isn't an easy life, but it provides for us. I promised mother I would protect you. You make a wrong move, one mistake, it could get you killed. So no mistakes. No mistakes then. No mistakes. Come, brother. I don't think he's going to make it. Move. Whoa! Lie down, brother. What happened? Centurion put his spear through you. Tore a pretty good sized hole. You've been here three days. You should be dead. Where are we? Jerusalem. Father has a woman here who took us in. You said three days? You were out for four, with a fever. Been here three. The healer said that you wouldn't make it, but I told her you were too tough. Now look at you. Aren't I the lucky one? What about the rest of the men? At the cave. The ones who made it out at least. What is it, Gestas? Tell me. Come. Thank you. For coming back. I know you did it for your brother, but you saved me too. You would have done it for me. No. I wouldn't have. I've hated you from the day we met. You earned respect. To speak truly, that only made me despise you more. Jealous, I suppose. I've shown you nothing but cruelty over the years. We all have had difficult childhoods. I've always hoped that we could become friends. You are my brother. No more distrust. No more anger. No more cruelty. From this day on, I will look out for you and Jotham... as if you were my own brothers, my own flesh and blood. I swear it. I trust your words. Get some rest. Watch your step there. These streets are terrible. I hate this city. Yeah. You hate all cities. Too noisy. I grew up sleeping in the desert. I'm used to quiet. Aside from the regular nighttime raids. I want some fruit. You want some fruit? Figs? Sure. I think I over did it, boys. I'm gonna sit for a while. Are you okay? I'm fine. Go, go to the marketplace. I just need some rest. You sure? Yes, go. I'll be fine. Go. I'll bring you back a fig. Okay. Our journeys began in this place. Yeshua? I am. Why am I here? You are here because you seek the past and not the future. What you thirst for is not here. I have not been back here since my mother was killed. That night, a part of me died too. She was the only person who ever truly loved me. If she saw me now, she would be ashamed. She would never forgive me. No one is beyond forgiveness. You are bound by chains, and know not that you have the key. Seek forgiveness from the Father, and He will set you free. I deserve my fate. I just hope it's not too late for my brother, and me too. I heard you are a healer. Can you help me? Can you make me well again? Rise, Dismas. Your journey is far from over. Dismas? I want every man here... to know... that I am indebted to you... for saving my son. To Dismas! Dismas! Now, to speak truthfully, I'm growing old, and the time has come for me to find a wife and a few mistresses. And settle down. Enjoy the spoils of life. But before that day comes, because that day has not arrived yet, Dismas... Is the one whose lead you will follow. From this day forward... you are to follow his commands as if they were my own. To legacies and legends! Don't worry about Gestas. He's sulking. He'll be fine. It's not Gestas that concerns me. Shouldn't Abba be the one to lead the men? Abba? Have you gone mad? How long do you think these men would last with that bloodthirsty oaf as their chief? They'd all be killed in a glorious battle with the Romans before the year's end. Dismas... you are the right choice. Every man here knows it. And now... for a proper celebration. Word has reached my ear about our old friend, Thomas. That's right, you remember the traitor. I won't even call him a man. He abandoned us, he stole from us, He hid in the hills like a coward. He has now forgotten who he is. But we do not forget. We know who we are. We're going to take back what is ours. Gestas. Thought I might find you out here. How could he do that to me? I'm his son. I've done everything he's ever asked of me. I've earned the right to take over when he's gone. You know Dismas couldn't have known, right? He probably doesn't even want... Dismas would never do that to you. I'm not mad at Dismas. It's my father who's the fool. He didn't have to choose right now, he could have waited, given me a chance to prove myself. I should kill him while he sleeps and take what's mine. Gestas, you cannot talk like this. Tiran needed to choose someone with a level head. You know that. Gestas... I didn't know. Of course not. You forget my father was ashamed of me long before my brothers came along. You've done nothing wrong by me. My problem is with my father, not my brothers. I'm glad you understand. I am going to drink myself to sleep now. Good night. Be well. Brother, I need to talk to you. What is it? Is it about Gestas? You're gonna think I've gone mad, but hear me out. Promise me. Okay, I promise. You saw my wound. You saw how bad it was, right? I saw it, what of it? You remember the night mother was killed? The baby that was born in the stable? Yeshua... I remember. In Nazareth, when you and Gestas... went to the marketplace, I was by the gate. I fell asleep. I had a dream, a vision. He came to me. We spoke. He said that no one was beyond forgiveness and that I must ask the Father to forgive me. We spoke about him being a healer. I asked could he heal me. I asked him to make me well again. It sounds like he cast some sort of spell on you. No spell. It was him, and he came to me, and he healed me. Dismas, that is not possible. Remember what the Magi said? He said that the baby's birth fulfilled a prophesy. I remember. I remember that that prophesy is the reason why the soldiers came to Bethlehem, why they killed mother and Aram. I remember it, brother. How could I forget? Jotham, what if they were right? They were superstitious old men! Dismas, what kind of savior brings death to everyone around him? Well, surely you remember the day at the well. You saw it. You felt it, too. I don't know what I saw! It could have been a dream for all we know. There's no way you believe that. And who are you to tell me what I believe? I'm your brother. That's who I am! Get back here! Thomas. Tiran. You plan on using that? That's up to you, old friend. You shouldn't have stolen what's ours. I only took what was rightfully mine. Use that sword, they die. Give it to me, settle your debt, and we'll be on our way. What, Thomas? You'll let them live? Kill the family. No! Run! Run! Run, run! Run, run! See you on the other side. Dismas! Why'd you let the boy go? This has gone too far. We must go, before we get dragged any deeper into this. Tiran has been good to us. Tiran is mad. No. We ride hard to Jerusalem. Tonight. When the men are asleep. Take the money we have stashed. Buy fresh horses and keep on riding. Dismas, one mistake and we're dead. No mistakes. All we need is food and water to last us until tomorrow night. We don't need anything else. I'm afraid. So am I. But we use the fear to stay sharp. Brother. Get as much rest as you can. It's a long ride to the city. Where are you off to? I was going to go investigate the noise that I... You're a liar, Jotham. See, Gestas told me of your plan. Gestas? You did this? You were two rats in a desert alone. I gave you both a home. I raised you. Trusted you. Forgive us, Tiran. Father, please don't kill them. They deserve punishment, but not death. The punishment for treason is death! On your feet. These two men no longer want to be here. Now, we're going to help make that possible. Tiran, no. You can't do this! Dismas? Tonight, one of you will live, and one of you will die. You will fight each other to the death, and the survivor is free. No. I won't kill my brother! We've done you no injury. We only wanted to leave. Please. Please, don't make us do this. Father, cast them both out, a harsh but just punishment. I beg you. You do not to get to beg for their lives. That's not how this works. You need to slither back to your bedroll. You don't have the stomach for what comes next. Be gone. Jotham, I can't do this. I won't. If we're going to die, we're going to do it fighting! Abba, swords. Square them off. Kill anyone who draws near. Enough with the farewells. Fight. You both want to die tonight? Abba, end this! Let's end these... Go. And never return. Never. You lay eyes on them again, kill them. Standing orders. Barrabas, Barrabas, Barrabas! They're singing my song! Barabbas? You hear that? Kill a few Romans, and you're a hero. Sent by the Father. A hero for killing. Yeshua? That insane rabbi? Barrabas, come with me. You're going to see the prefect. I guess the Romans have a special treat in mind for me, boys. What about us? Patience, thief. Your time will come. You really think you deserved that life? You should have let that girl marry an honest man. I was being an honest man. By lying to her? I love her. What would you have me do? It's a beautiful day. I hate Capernaum. The whole place smells like fish. It's work, honest work. Possible work. I mean, who wants to hire people like us anyways? Who wouldn't want to hire two charming rogues? Excuse me sir? We're looking for Darius. You looking for work? Yes. We hear he's hiring. He is, but he's a bear to work for. Long hours, and he yells a lot. Great. Sounds like another drunken sailor who likes to crack a whip to feel superior. He's fair, but he doesn't tolerate nonsense or laziness. Believes a man with character should work hard for his wages. I can agree with that. But does he train? We've never made nets before. He'll train you. At half wage. As long as you don't run off to a fishing boat as soon as there's an opening. Pretty sure that's called slavery. You have soft hands, like a woman's. That won't last. Okay, we'll work for half wages. Can you introduce us to Darius, please? I'm Darius. I like you. You're hired. You too. Don't have as good a feeling about you, but I'm shorthanded. Come back at midday, you start. Thank you. You won't be disappointed. I will, but you'll get better. That's good. Very good. I had a good teacher. Six months and you'll be excellent. Your friend didn't want the job? I'm afraid not. He's sleeping on the floor of a room that I'm renting for now. Why in the heavens are you friends with a man like that? He's my brother. Ah. Family. Keep working. May I help you with that? I can do it. I'm know you can, but I can carry it for you. Your new here on the docks. I am. Fisherman? I'm net maker. Assistant net maker. Apprentice net maker. I'm still learning. To make nets? Yes My father is always looking for an apprentice who will stay more than a few months. Your father? Darius. This is my brother, Teman. I'm Dismas. I'm glad to have met you, net maker. I must return to the market, but I shall I see you again if you're still around. I'll be here. Shalom. Welcome back, brother. Well... apparently they stop giving you wine when you stop giving them coin. You should come work with me. Darius may hire you yet. You know, used to... if we wanted more to drink... I took more. No one dared refuse us. Give me some from the stash. It's just as much mine as it is yours. And if I did, it would be none of ours. So, no. Fine. I'll make my own money. That Yeshua is drawing in quite a crowd. I'm sure one of those fanatics has got to carry gold. Jotham, no! We left that way behind. You must change, if not for me, for mother. Darius? I have a favor to ask of you. Ask it. There's a rabbi coming to town and... You'd like to take the day off to hear this rabbi Yeshua teach. Yes. How did you know? Everyone for miles and miles is going to hear this Yeshua. No sales. No clients. No boats. No repairs. No fishermen. You might as well go. You know... But you must do me a favor. Of course, anything. Take Adinah with you. I was going to ask you if I might take her. Yes. I've seen the way you've been making fish eyes at my daughter. I guess she could do worse. You two might as well give it a try. Thank you. I'll treat her like a queen. Ah. Just treat her well. If you treat her like a queen, she'll expect it of me too. I see. But do treat her well. Yes, I will. I'm so excited! I never dreamed I'd be able to see the rabbi. It's too difficult getting out because of my leg. If you don't mind me asking... My leg? Yes. Are you in pain? Sometimes. It's a familiar pain though. Been with me since I was born, so I've grown used to it. Now, the looks I get, those I don't get used to. Maybe it's your beauty they notice, and not the limp. I'm afraid I won't be able to get any closer with the cart, Adinah. That's all right. I'm sure once everyone gets settled I'll be able to hear him from here. Well I could carry you. If you'll let me. May I? Come. Master? You spoke of forgiving our debts and debtors. What of those who have sinned against us? Or against Jehovah? Do we forgive them as well? If you forgive a man the sins he has committed against you, then our Father will also forgive you. If you cannot forgive a man who has wronged you, how can you expect our Father to do the same for you? Do not seek the forgiveness of Jehovah or your fellow man without having a truly penitent heart, or you will be like the hypocrites who pray loudly and without meaning so that they may be seen as righteous among men. If you ask Jehovah for something, He will give it to you. If you seek for something, you will find it. If you knock on the doors of heaven, they will be opened to you. With faith as small as a mustard seed, you can ask for a mountain to move... and it will be done. Adinah, do you remember me? Jacob! Yes. I remember you. I thought it was you. My Master... He saw you, and he sent me to speak to you. Yeshua? To us? What did he say? My Master told me to tell you that God favors you, because you are meek, and the meek will inherit the earth. Brother, no! Dismas, what are you doing? Stop this. It doesn't need to be this way. It should never have been this way. This is the way it is. This is the way the world works. We've never been given anything. The only things we have is what we have stolen, and the only things that we've kept is what has not been stolen back from us. You should know that more than anybody. You don't believe that. You can't believe that! There is another way, the way that Yeshua speaks of. Yeshua? Brother, your messiah is the reason for all of this! Don't you remember Bethlehem? Don't you remember Aram? Don't you remember... Mother would have wanted us to forgive. You spit on the memory of her. He also told me to tell you to get up and walk home. Rise. Dismas! My brother is always trying to keep me out of trouble. Keep yourself out of trouble, brother! But no, he doesn't. He doesn't even come out to the bar, you know? Doesn't drink, does not let loose. I'm not trouble. What did you say your name was? Don't, don't, don't please don't! Please don't. I don't have anything worth taking. Now... Why would I do a thing like that? Abba? You're not here to avenge Tiran? No. There were a few men who wanted revenge, but that didn't last. The Romans caught up with us a few days later and we had more important things to worry about. So you haven't been chasing me all these years? No. No one's hunting you. Except that damned Roman, Longinus. I'm sure he'd love to see you on a cross. We'll make camp here tonight. You joining us? I will. I'm glad you agreed to come with us to Jerusalem for Passover. Of course. I'm honored that you invited me. I still can't believe you haven't seen the city. It's wonderful. I'm looking forward. Good evening, fellow travelers. You wouldn't mind us weary men sharing your campsite, would you? I'm afraid we would mind. It will be too crowded. With the few of you and my men? There are more of us down at the water with livestock, and the other half of our caravan is on their way. So maybe you should leave. Funny, I did not pass anyone on our ride in. Now, why would you lie to a fellow traveler? Teman! Easy there, friend. No one will get hurt if you cooperate. Take what you want and leave us. You don't even want to talk to an old friend? Now, where are your manners? Our little family has not been the same since you left. We were never family. What's the meaning of this? We're all friends. No need to worry. Look, Barrabas. We did not know whose caravan this was. Let's just be on our way. Jotham! No! No! No! I'm sorry! He was going to try kill me! No! Teman! No! You've grown careless. Perhaps I've just grown tired of being two steps ahead of you. The gods must be smiling on me today. I remember you two. Arrest these three. Leave the bodies for the dogs. What's happening out there? Barrabas went free. Went free? Apparently your people fear a prophet more than a murderer. What about us? Jotham of Capernaum. Thief and murderer. By proclamation of Pontius Pilate, you are to be crucified for your many crimes against the citizens of Rome. Dismas of Capernaum. Thief and murderer. By proclamation of Pontius Pilate, you are to be crucified for your crimes against Rome. Yesuah of Nazareth. By proclamation of Pontius Pilate, you are to be crucified for sedition against Rome. No! Please, no! My son! What have I done? What have I done? It wasn't supposed to be like this. Aren't you the Messiah? Save us! Save yourself! No angels to come and save us? You... You never could save anyone, could you? Your savior is a fake! We deserve this fate, brother. Not him. Have mercy on him. I'm sorry I didn't protect you, brother. Yeshua... Yes? I know I deserve this. But please forgive me. Remember me... when you enter... into your kingdom. Tonight... you will be with me... in paradise. Father... it is... finished. I'm free!
