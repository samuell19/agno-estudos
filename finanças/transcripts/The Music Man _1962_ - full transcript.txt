If you're all through I'll tell you about this Harold Hill. Say, you know Hill? Never saw him in my life. But l just been run out of town because of Hill. He's giving every one of us a black eye. You go into town to call on the trade... ...and they're waiting for you with tar and feathers... ...to ride you out the city limits on a rail! How you account for that? It's this Hill! He goes around selling band instruments and uniforms... ...and instruction books by guaranteeing to teach the kids to play. -Stands to reason. -And organize them kids into a band... ...with himself as the leader. What's wrong with that? He don't know one note... -...from another! -Heh-heh. That's what's wrong! He don't know a bass drum from a pipe organ. He's a bare-faced, double-shuffle, two-bit thimblerigger! And l'll catch up with him one of these days. When I do l'll have the law on him quick! Territory's tough enough without him fouling up the nest. I'd like to be around when you catch up with him. I'm not apt to catch up with him in lowa. Not on your kidney plaster! He's too smart to pull that flimflam out here. Not on these neck-bowed Hawkeyes. [MAN LAUGHS] Gentlemen, you intrigue me. I think I'll have to give Iowa a try. -l didn't catch your name. -l didn't drop it. Sir--? [DOG BARKlNG] Fine-looking animal. For a horse, yeah. Good morning. Could you kindly direct me to the center of town? Runs right down the middle of the street. [COW MOOS] Friend, where would l find a good hotel? Try the Palmer House in Chicago. I'm a stranger in town. What do you folks do for excitement? Mind our business. [SINGS] You are in Io-way At least now l know how to pronounce it. I thought you preferred lo-wuh. We do. But he just said lo-way. We say it now and then. But we don't like anybody else to. BOTH: We are from lo-way I know. Well, you folks certainly do know how to make a body feel at home. Oh, there's nothing halfway About the Iowa way to treat you When we treat you Which we may not do at all There's an Iowa kind of special Chip-on-the-shoulder attitude -We've never been without -That we recall ALL: We can be cold as The falling thermometer in December If you ask about our weather in July And we're so by-God stubborn We can stand touching noses For a week at a time And never see eye to eye ALL: But what the heck You're welcome Join us at the picnic -You can eat your fill -Of all the food you bring yourself ALL: You really ought to give Iowa a try Provided you were contrary Good morning, Mayor Shinn. ALL: Good morning, Mayor Shinn. It is if you want to go around in your drawers all day. ALL: We can be cold as A falling thermometer in December If you ask about our weather in July And we're so by-God stubborn We can stand touching noses For a week at a time And never see eye to eye But we'll give you our shirt And the back to go with it If your crop should happen to die So what the heck You're welcome Glad to have you with us BOTH: Even though we may not Ever mention it again ALL: You really ought to give Iowa Hawkeye lowa Dubuque, Des Moines, Davenport Marshalltown, Mason City Keokuk, Ames, Clear Lake Ought to give Iowa a try Mr. Squires. Yes. I'm interested in a rig for Sunday. Then you ought to see the man in charge of hiring rigs. Rigs? MAN: Riggs? Ain't nobody here by that name. Marcellus! Marcellus Washburn! Gregory! [LAUGHS] Of all the people to run into in lowa! Gregory! Shh. Hill's the name this trip. Professor Harold Hill. Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I didn't know l was, myself. I never thought l'd find a slicker like you here in the sarsaparilla belt. This is where I work. -You mean you live in this town? -Yeah. I like it too. It's not Brooklyn, New York. Not the city of homes and churches but-- Brooklyn? Marce, this isn't even Dubuque. Hey. Are you hiding out or what? Just not as light on my feet as I used to be when l was shilling for you. You're in a business that got a lot of close shaves. I got a nice job now. I got a nice girl. Ethel Toffelmier. That's the boss's niece. So you've gone legitimate, huh? I knew you'd come to no good. What are you selling now? I heard you were in steam automobiles. -l was. -What happened? -Somebody actually invented one. -No! So now l'm back at the old stand. Not boys' bands? They got no call for boys' bands in this town. Anything Iowa folk don't have they do without. They got music? They got a gramophone down to the barber shop. And a stuck-up librarian gives piano. -Gives piano? -A maiden lady. She'll expose you before you unpack this bag. Maiden lady librarians who give piano are a specialty of mine. Just point her out the minute you see her. Yeah. l'll back her into a corner and breathe on her glasses. [CHUCKLES] Thar she blows! I'll do it but I won't like it. [CHUCKLES] That's not the librarian. That's Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife. [BOTH LAUGH] Good afternoon, Mrs. Shinn. Don't change the subject. Something the matter? The same thing is the matter as is always the matter here. Look! Is this the sort of book you give my daughter? This Ruby Hat of Omar Kay-ay-ay-- I am appalled! I did recommend it. It's beautiful Persian poetry. It's dirty Persian poetry. People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches. Getting drunk with pitfall and with gin. Drinking directly out ofjugs with innocent young girls. -No daughter of mine-- -Mrs. Shinn. The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam is a classic. It's a smutty book, like most of the others you keep here, I daresay. Honestly, Mrs. Shinn. Wouldn't you rather have your daughter read a classic than Elinor Glyn? What Elinor Glyn reads is her mother's problem. Just you keep your dirty books away from my daughter. You sure picked yourself a town. Let me take you over to the hotel. Not sure l'm going to stay yet. First l got to find a way to get into some of these lowa boodlebags. Greg, it ain't easy. All I need is an opening. You remember the pitch. What can I use? What's new around here? The other day a farmer brought in an egg had 3 yolks in it. Was in the paper. That's exciting, all right. No, what do you talk about? There's the weather, of course. When it's in season. Now, Marce, I need some ideas... ...if I'm going to get your town out of the serious trouble it's in. River City ain't in any trouble. We'll have to create some. Must create a desperate need in your town for a boys' band. Why is everyone rubbering into the billiard parlor? MARCELLUS: They just got in a new pool table. HAROLD: They must have seen one before. No. Just billiards. That'll do it! Just sit where you are. And remember... ...if you see that music teacher.... Are you Mr. Dunlop? Either you're closing your eyes to a situation you don't wish to acknowledge... ...or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster... ...indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community. [SINGING] Well, you got trouble, my friend Right here, I say Trouble right here in River City Why, sure, I'm a billiard player Certainly mighty proud to say I'm always proud to say it I consider that the hours l spend With a cue in my hand are golden Help you cultivate horse sense And a cool head and a keen eye You ever take and try to give An ironclad leave to yourself From a three-rail billiard shot? But just as I say It takes judgment, brains and maturity To score in a balk-line game I say that any boob Can take and shove a ball in a pocket And l call that sloth The first big step on the road To the depths of degrada-- l say first Medicinal wine from a teaspoon Then beer from a bottle The next thing you know your son is Playing for money in a pinch-back suit And listening to some big Out-o'-town jasper Hearing him tell about Horserace gambling Not a wholesome trotting race, no But a race where they set down Right on the horse! Like to see some stuck-up jockey boy Setting on Dan Patch? Make your blood boil? Well, I should say! Now, friends Let me tell you what I mean You got 1 , 2, 3, 4 5, 6 pockets in a table Pockets that mark the difference Between a gentleman and a bum With a capital B and that Rhymes with P and that stands for pool And all week long your River City Youth'll be frittering away I say your young men'll be frittering Frittering away their noontime Suppertime, chore time too Get the ball in the pocket Never mind getting dandelions pulled Or the screen door patched Or the beefsteak pounded Never mind pumping any water Till your parents are caught With the cistern empty on a Saturday night And that's trouble Yes, you got lots and lots of trouble I'm thinking of the kids in the Knickerbockers, shirttail young ones Peeking in the pool hall window After school You got trouble, folks Right here in River City Trouble with a capital T and that Rhymes with P and that stands for pool Now l know all you folks Are the right kind of parents I'm going to be perfectly frank Would you like to know what kind of Conversation goes on While they're loafing around that hall? They'll be trying out Bevo Trying out Cubebs Trying out Tail or Mades Like cigarette fiends And bragging all about How they're going to cover up A telltale breath with Sen-Sen One fine night they leave the pool hall Headin' for the dance at the Armory Libertine men and scarlet women And ragtime Shameless music That'll grab your son Your daughter, with the arms of A jungle animal instinct mass-teria Friends, the idle brain Is the devil's playground, trouble! CROWD: We got trouble -Right here in River City With a capital T and that rhymes with P And that stands for pool We've surely got trouble Right here in River City Got to figure out a way to keep The young ones moral after school Our children's children Gonna have trouble Mothers of River City, heed that warning before it's too late. Watch for the telltale signs of corruption. The minute your son leaves the house... ...does he rebuckle his knickerbockers below the knee? Is there a nicotine stain on his index finger? A dime novel hidden in the corn crib? Is he starting to memorize jokes from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang? Are certain words creeping into his conversation? Words like.... Like "swell." And "So's your old man." If so, my friends.... You got trouble Right here in River City With a capital T and that rhymes with P And that stands for pool We surely got trouble Right here in River City Remember the Maine, Plymouth Rock And the Golden Rule Our children's children Gonna have trouble Oh-ho, we got trouble We're in terrible, terrible trouble That game with the 1 5 numbered balls Is the devil's tool Oh, yes, we got Trouble, trouble, trouble -With a T -With a capital T Got to rhyme it with P And that stands for pool Remember, my friends, listen to me Because I pass this way but once! -Did you drop your--? -No. -Didn't I meet you in--? -No. I'll only be in town a short while.

Neither has anyone else in this town There you go again With the same old comment About the low mentality Of River City people And taking it all too much to heart Now, Mama, as long as the.... Madison Public Library Was entrusted to me For the purpose of improving River City's cultural level I can't help my concern that The ladies of River City Keep ignoring All my counsel and advice But, darling! When a woman has a husband And you've got none Why should she take advice from you Even if you can quote Balzac and Shakespeare And all them other Highfalutin Greeks? If you don't mind my saying so You have a bad habit Of changing every subject No, I haven't changed the subject I was talking about that stranger -What stranger? -With the suitcase Who may be your very last chance Do you think that I'd allow A common masher? Now really, Mama! I have my standards Where men are concerned And l have no intention-- I know all about your standards And if you don't mind my saying so There's not a man alive Who could hope to measure up To that blend of Paul Bunyan, Saint Pat and Noah Webster You've concocted for yourself Out of your lrish imagination Your lowa stubbornness And your library full of books [BANGS KEYS] Well, if that isn't the best l ever heard!

[SPEAKING WITH A LlSP] No, thank you, Amaryllith! "Amaryllith"! [AMARYLLlS LAUGHS] [WlNTHROP SOBS] He's crying! [WlNTHROP SOBS] Hello, Winthrop. Winthrop, you didn't even say hello to your sister. He hates to say Amaryllis because of the lisp. He's ashamed. We know all about his lisp, Amaryllis. Why should he get so mad at people? Just because he lisps? -That's just part of it. -What's the rest of it? Never mind, dear. It's just that he never talks very much. Not even to you and your mother? No, but we have to be very patient and understanding. I'm patient. I even say good night to him on the evening star. Every night. Good night, my Winthrop. Good night. Sleep tight. [SOBS] And he never says anything to me. Oh, darling, don't cry. You'll have lots of time for sweethearts. If not Winthrop, there'll be someone else. Never! I'll end up an old maid like you. I'm sorry, Miss Marian. Can l play my cross-hand piece? -May I--? -May I play my cross-hand piece? Yes, you may. If a girl doesn't have a sweetheart... ...who's she going to say good night to on the evening star? For the time being, you can just say: "Good night... ...my someone." You can put the name in when the right someone comes along. All right. lt's better than nothing. Yes, it is. Now you can play your cross-hand piece. [PLAYING "GOOD NlGHT MY SOMEONE"] Good night, my someone Good night, my love Sleep tight, my someone Sleep tight, my love Our star is shining Its brightest light For good night, my love For good night Sweet dreams be yours, dear lf dreams there be Sweet dreams To carry you Close to me I wish they may And I wish they might Now good night, my someone Good night True love can be whispered From heart to heart When lovers are parted, they say But I must depend On a wish and a star As long as my heart Doesn't know who you are Sweet dreams be yours, dear lf dreams there be Sweet dreams To carry you close to me BOTH: I wish they may And I wish they might Now good night, my someone Good night CHORUS [SINGlNG]: O Columbia The gem of the ocean The home of the brave and the free The shrine of each patriot's devotion A world offers homage to thee Thy mandates make heroes assemble When liberty's form stands in view Thy banners make tyranny tremble When borne by the red, white and blue Thy banners make tyranny tremble When borne by the red, white and blue [SINGS OFF-KEY] [APPLAUSE] I'm sure we're all grateful to my wife... ...Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn, for leading the singing.

Aren't you mechanically minded? Did you ever do anything with... ...perpetual motion? Yeah. l nearly had it a couple times. You did? Well, you're my man.
