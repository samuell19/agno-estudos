Listen boy. You touch my gun again I'll have your fucking head mounted. You shouldn't have an animal. It was to far. Now we got a wounded buffalo out there. | don't want anybody telling me it's to far! All right what the hells going on? Where's Tailor | want to speak with him? He's back at camp. When | paid for my guide at Suffarie it wasn't for the "B" team. It said escorted by a white hunter. I've just about had it up to here being told what | can and what | can't shoot by some chicken shit negra. - Get Taller. - He's unavailable. And he doesn't like people using animals... for target practice and he's had it up to here with killing. Great. I'm on a fucking safari. My great white hunter, your boss, losses his appetite for killing animals. | don't suppose he's lost his appetite for taking my money has he? I'm going in there after that buffalo myslf, alone. No your not pal. You go in there and there's an accident the governments.... going to use it to try and ban hunting entirely. That should suit you. You're just as yellow bellied as Taylor is. All right Roger you go with him. Yeah you come with me. And you can take a picture of me and the buffalo. Runl. Buffalo killed him man. Buffalo killed him. There she is. Keep the lights off until | need it. Lets take her by surprise. Miss Hill what is your position on government plans... to loosen restrictions on gun hunting in Secarta? What? On television you said detested the killing of Africa wild life. | don't know if | said that | suppose so yes. So you are against the governmente plan? I'm against the killing of African wild life. The rhinoceros is almost kolled off as it is. Doing that with a license from the government doesn't nake it any different from what this terrible..Sing, Roger Sing, that should tell you something about people who kill animals. You mean the Sing who was in for manslaughter? Before that the had a conviction for poaching. | know for a fact that he was responsible... for killing off the rhinoceros in this country. He's just a killer either way. Bitch! Goddamn loudmouth bitch! What right does she got to talk about me on television like that? As reported earlier Roger Sing is the ex-butcher released yesterday after serving four years for manslaughter. We'll be back with more news... Roger? Taxi. Elephant, very cheap. Good elephant. Want to buy? - Miss Micah Hill? - Yes. Am | glad to see you. - I'm Watson. - Hello. I'm to drive you to Mr. Taylors place. Oh, thank God. Thank you. Excuse me. Hi. I'm John Sterling. Sorry I'm a bit late | got held up in traffic. Hi. Watson how are you doing? Very well. Well. Welcome to Sackomo. I've come for the painting. | can tell you | was looking forward to your presentation. Especially the President. | think they sold some 200 tickets already. It seems that everyone in the capitol whnts to meet the famous Micah Hill. That's great | hope the President likes my painting. I'm sure he will. Can | have a look? Wonderful. It's exactly what we need. Look at that Watson. The whole thing is a great idea. | hope it influences the government to help wild life. I'm sure it will. I'm certain it will. Well Watson will take you out to the camp is he? - That's right. - Oh, good. In that case I'll see you at the reception. Nice to meet you and thank you. - See you Watson. - My pleasure. Bye. It's all right. It's okay. It's in good hands. - Ian. - Yah. That're leaving now. Get out of the bloody way. 45 minutes I've been waiting. Was | glad to see you. | was to fine. Are you about coming over to Africa. What was that? You see that? You see that? Shit. No more. Leave now. Who are these people? They're my parents. They want you to marry me too. You think | want to marry you? | don't want to marry you. Did you really think that | want to grow old like that in this shit hole of a place? Get out you bitch! Go on! Get ouit! Bitch. Someone called you. | lefe a message by the telephone. You see Roger you do need me. I'll show you how much | need you. Just watch. Hi. Amanda. It's the old Roger. Just got out. Why don't you come around tonight eh? Good. Bring that friend of yours with you okay? Yeah, Right see you later. Damn conservationist bitch. We've arrived. No, it's okay. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Enjoy yourself. Micahl - Jane! you were coming a few day earlier before the reception. How are you? Very good to see you. It's great to see you. How are you and lan doing? Oh, lans so busy these days with his anti-poaching and his African wild groups. You know he has a meeting with the President... at least once a week. That leaves me to run the Safari camp all by myself. Thank goodness it's off season now. Come on, I'll show you to your tent. | brought you something. Have you? What is it? Can | guess. Surprise. Hello. Oh, | don't think you met Zolco. No. Last time | was here there was a leopard. Oh, yes | remember. It was in here when you came to bed. That's right. Is this a surprise? Thank you, Micah how lovely. That's beautiful. And your letting your schedule working on the book? said you've broken off you engagement. Yeah well that's ancient history now. Oh, dear. Well maybe you'd like coffee. Lets go and find lan. Where is lan anyway? | think he's wandering around in the bush somewhere. | worry about him you know. He refuses to carry a gun anymore. Maybe that's not a bad thing? It was a bad thing? - | told you she was coming early. - What? | told you she was coming early. - Did you? - Yes. Well, my God look at her. She's beautiful. Welcome home. It's been too long. Thanks it's to see you. And a television star to boot. Was it on already? It certainly was. Well you're famous now aren't you? People want to know what you have to say. What was it dear? Oh, just some TV reporter making damn fool questions. Micah said she was against poaching. Well, that's good if Micah says so people will listen won't they? Yes, they will. Well, | don't know why. They shouldn't really. | don't know much about it. Hey you should have seen those elephants we saw on the way up here. Millions of them. That's odd. Well, how was your trip? You must need a drink. Wash all that dust down. Come on. Damn government. What do they care. Tucked away in their big offices and their big houses. The way they enforce the laws against poaching... you might just as well be legel. They even talk of loosening the hunting laws now... Just to make it easier for them to ignore the whole problem. It's the poor animals that suffer. Those in the field who still care about them. Ian you'll upset Micha. I'm afraid he's on his soapbox again. Well, somone's got cope with this madness. Bastards. You know what these poachers do Micah? They go into the animal parks, Wild life preserves, and they slaughter the elephants. Poor defenseless elephants. They hack off their tusks and leave the carcasses to rot. They don't ever use the meat with thousands starving here. Nobody cares. Nobody does anymore. | shouldn't be bothering you with all this should 1? You don't want to hear it do you? There's somebody coming. Hello Jane. Lan. What are you doing here? This is Micah Hill. Mark Smith. You heard us talk about Michah. She's here to present here painting at the reception on Friday. | know. | saw it in the newspaper. It's nice to meet you. | suppose you also read Roger Sing? Yeah. Why they let son of a bitch out I'll never know. You should have seen Micah on the television today. She called him a killer. - What is she crazy? - No Mark. Hang on. Exactly what did you say about Roger Sing? | don't know. | said, it was in the papers about him being a poacher. | said | was against poaching that's all. You know if Rogers heard any of this... he's going to have a wild hair up his ass. Yes, yes. Have a brandy. You're not working are you? Yeah. I'm on my way up country. There are signs of elephants everywhere... and I've got to keep them from heading into and farming district. If you don't mind | thought I'd buck here tonight and get an early start. | hope you do. You know it was Mark who was responsible... for Rogers Sings conviction. The funny thing is Roger always claimed... that Mark was the murderer. Well, what did you expect him to say? It was his wors against mine and | guarantee if it hadn't been for that poaching conviction of his the year before they'd probably just as soon believe him as me. | was right. Poachers and murderers. | just think you should be careful what you say. With a man like Roger Sing you never know he'll do. | doubt if Roger Sing has ever read a newspaper in his life. You'll be all right don't worry. We won't let anything happen to you. Ian. I need your help. How do you feel about going to Sukoma tomorrow? Sukoma? | just got back. Just try and send up a plane or two. I've got to get those elephants headed... back into the parks and the President will listen to you. All right. Someone will have to look after Micah. She'll have to go with you. Ian I think I'd rather stay here and sketch. Please. Jane's busy tomorrow. It'll be an adventure for you. You'll see a lot more animals if you go. All right. All right it's a deal. It might give her some facts for the talk shows. I'll see you here at 5 AM okay? | think I'll do to bed now. Will it be possible to take a bath? Yes, of coarse. Come on. - Good night. - Good night. You'll get along just fine you'll see. Get out of the bloody way. Jesus, you brute. Yeah, yeah, you little monster. Go on. And you you miserable... All right. So lets go and have a drink eh? That would be nice. Lets do it again. Lets go have a drink and then do it again. Pass me the matches will ya. - Here you are. - Thanks. How do you feel now? Good. What's your message here. Here read it for me. Elephants went in crops. Needed taken care of. New York. - Fred Johnson. - Fred Johnson. What is it? It's a ghost. | got to go. You're going - I'm sorry. It's business girls. All right girls. You let yourselves out eh. I'm going to miss you. Take care. Oh, God if it wasn't elehants it would to be you eh. Hey now listen when | come back, money, lots of dresses for you. A dozen dresses each and with party. Hey now don't... until | come back. Did they go all ready? Right on time. | must be off too. I'll come with if you like? No, no. I'll be back tonight. Take care. I'm sorry about last night. What are you going to do with those when you fine them? I'll try to heard them back into the park. If that doesn't work they'll have to be shot. Easy way out huh? | suppose it's your job to do it? Yeah. Unfortunately it is. When I was a kid growing up on the farm... | watched my grandfather put a raccoon into a burlap bag and smash it up against the wall for destroying the crops. | just don't believe that's the only solution. - Give me a braek. - What? Nothing. Nothing. Shit! You okay? Goddamn it. Elephants are destroying thenselves. Elephants? What about that truck of wood. And look at your arm. Shit. Hand me that kit by your foot. Okay let me help. Thanks. Shit. It looks the elephants have moved on through the village. | got to check it out. Micah! | couldn't wait any longer. These damn people you'd think they were my elephants. | can't control the Goddam things. Maybe you can put something around the cusp... that the elephants don't like. Oh, yeah like what? Like an orbiting missile station with elephant seeking war heads. You really think what happed to those people was funny? | don't know. Maybe people laugh at different things where you live. Where is that now New York? That's why | left. I'm sorry. All right we'll take a break here and eat some lunch. Oh, my God. There's hundreds of them. And they're moving right to Fred Johnson's farm. I've never seen anything like it. I'm glad you got a chance to. It's not going to last. Come on, lets eat. He's got the legal right to shoot any of those elephants who trespass. | just wish | know why they were leaving the parks. It use to be the heavy poaching. | don't know. Maybe it's the drought. Shit. Stay herel. Where you going Roger? What the hells business is it of yours? Just because you're a big game warden now doesn't mean... to say you can stop people going about their ordinary business. Get out of my way. | heard you were out. What was it? Government connections? If you're thinking about those elephants Roger you can just turn around and head back right here and now. Nobody tells me what to do. Well I'm telling you. Move out. | don't suppose you'd care to put that rifle down and argue about it? Move Roger! What's going on? Nothing. Nothing to be concerned about. Look, we better head out. Did you have enough lunch? I'm not really hungry. I'll eat later. You sure you're all right? Yeah, come on. Fred! Hey Fred! How ya doin' Fred? Roger bloody Sing. | heard they let you fly. | should have known you'd come looking around here. Jail never changed anybody for the good. | ain't lookin' around Fred. | came because you called. What? The elephants. You called me. | didn't call. Oh, come on Fred. I've been driving all night. I've even had a puncture and now you're telling me you didn't call me? That's right. | didn't call you. Oh, come on. Now, that you're here, come here. Hey Fred. You're the one you are. It's a great place you got here you know. If | don't make some money quick I'm gonna loose it. Don't worry. I've got a proposition to put to you. Here sit down. You know you didn't come to see me. What are you after? | told you. Elephants. Lvory. What's in it for me? You get to keep your crops Fred. | can clear them out myself. But you can't get rid of the ivory. I've got the contacts. Across the border down to the coast. It's got to be in India by the end of the month. Your share will be paid in dollars anywhere you want in the world within 3 months. What do you think it would be worth my share? 200 elephants lets say only 40 pounds a head. Your share must be worth 25-30 thousand dollars. That's not bad for a nights work Fred. You never Killed 200 elephants in one night. My boys have killed over 200 elephants in an hour. 25 or 30 you say. That's risky. You get caught | go to jail. Lose everything. The way things are the banks are going to take it. Let me think about would you? Let me think about it. You want some coffee? I'll have a beer. Roger, that's all | bloody need. - Hello Mark. - Hello Fred. | thought you'd coming along. Hey Rogers in there. Big surprise | didn't even know he was out yet. | thought as much Fred. Hello. Hi. I'm Micah Hill. Yeah, | know it. I've seen ya in the newspapers. Please come in, come in. Hey Roger, I'd like you to meet Micah Hill. This is Roger Sing. What the hell are you doing here Roger? | thought | told you to stay clear of these elephants. I'm not doing anything. I'm visiting an old friend. You'll never learn will ya. You're getting yourself into trouble already. Look. I'm two days out of jail and you're already on my case. Following me around eh. Trying to make a mess of my lifel. You and your girlfriend here. | should have known eh. What a pair. I'm not following you Roger. | just came from the village east of here. It was torn up pretty bad so | figured... some of the elephants must have ended up here. You're a lying son of a bitch. You called me last night didn't you? Left a message to tell me to come down here. | don't know what you're talking about. You're a sneaky bastard just like you always were. Only this time your little setup didn't work. - You left me that phony message. - Nobody set you up Roger. Nobody but yourself. You killed that guy 4 years ago and you know it. You better take care Miss Hill your boyfriend here is a murderer. That's bullshit. Your boy friend and | were partners once in... a hunting firm with lan Taylor. And one day something went wrong. One of our rich American clients got Killed. And | was the fall guy. And what about the money that was missing? | never denied taking that money. But that guy was dead with your bullet in his guts. You screwed me man. You really screwed me. Why did you do that man? And now you come down here to set me up again and bring your girlfriend down to talk about me on the television yet. That's a lie Roger. That's a crock of shit and you know it. I'll be leaving now Fred. Get out of my way please. Get out of my way. You got a permit for that rifle Roger? What? That rifle out in your truck. After where you've been it's not likely. You got a permit or not? Oh, come on man for Gods sake. Well, it's a good thing | came by. You're coming with me Roger. I'm placing you under arrest for unlawful possession of a firearm and you can bet your ass you're going back to prison. Do something! Get up. - Give me that gun. - Stay where you are. | won't have you boys fighting on my property. You want to kill each other go do it sonewhere else. Come Roger up. Come on up. You messed around enough in my life. And you you bitch. You ok? Your arms bleeding again. Rogers crazy, always was. | didn't send for him. Yes, sure Fred. Thanks a lot for your help. It's best not to make an enemy of a man like that. And get those elephants off my land or | will my way. I'll take care of if Fred. And next time you see anymore... on your land you call us not Roger Sing. - I tell ya | didn't call him. - Yeah but who did? Roger thinks you did. | got to make a call, can | use the phone? Is Roger really as dangerous as he seems? No, don't worry about it. He just wants those elephants. Mark had better keep clear though. Were you really going to kill those elephants? Well | can't have them destroying my property. Couldn't you put up electric fences? With 25 thousand acres? I'm no millionaire you know. Yeah - Hello John that you? Mark, where are you? I'm out at Fred Johnsons. The elephants are moving on to his farm. Look, let me talk to lan. Ah, Mark lan isn't here. | haven't spoken to him in weeks. What do you mean you haven't spoken to him? He should have been there by now. | really don't know where he is. Shit. He was supposed to have been there this morning to talk to you about this goddamn eleghant problem. All right John look. If you can wait for him and if he doesn't show... will you do me a favor and drive up here? Sure mark anytime you say. By the way Roger Sings on the prowl again. | got to try to figure out a way to stop him. Jesus Christ. We got to go. Mark. You know | got to warn you. Roger thinks you set him up. Let's go, come out here and just happen to turn up yourself. Just asking about gun permits. You two are bad news for each other. Always have been. Something is going to come of it before it's over. Someone's going to get hurt. Well thanks a lot for your concern Ferd. - But | can take care of myself. - Sure. Sure you can. What about her? Look. Just to be safe you better not at Jane and lan's... at least until we get Sing in custody. We got to assume he's going to come after both of us now especially after what you said about him in the newapaper. Where will | stay then? You'd be safe at my place. It's all right. Sing doesn't know where | live. Lets go. What's the matter? Come on. Come on. | got to get somebody up here to take care of these elephants and | got Roger Sing to worry about. Is there any truth in what he said? What? You set him up. Set Roger up. Well this is it. You've got everything you need right here. It doesn't have much of a woman's touch this place. | found that wome in this part of the world... generally don't get along to well. All right goddamn it I'm sorry. What about? About getting you involved in this. | should have know better than to take you along. | can take care of myself. | know that. Just don't think we should be enemies right now. Mark. Did you send Roger that message? | told you | didn't. Time of my friend. You took your time coming back home. Yeah, between Watson and me... we keep things running pretty smooth around here. Can you help me with that box? - Yes. - Thanks. Hello. Good to see you again. Nice to see you too. | didn't know you lived here. This is home. How come he met me yesterday? Who Watson? Yeah. He met me at the airport. | don't know. He must have been in town picking up supplies. Occasionally he helps lan. Do you live here all the time? Yeah most of the year. Your sure we're going to be safe here? Look. You're going to have to learn to trust me. You don't have another choice. I've seen Roger with that look he had today. He's always figuring some way to get what he wants. Right now, he wants revenge, on me and maybe on you too. I'm afraid he's going to try something. | just wish | could call Jane and lan. What on the short wave? No, Roger knows the frequency. He can intercept the call... and | don't want to give him any clues about where we are. Now don't worry. Jane and lan know I'll take care of you. Come on. I'll get the beb fixed up for you. Lie down. Where are you sleeping? I'll sleeping on the couch. Don't worry I'm just trying to keep you safe... and make you comfortable. I've got enough food packed for you to last a week. All right. You look after her, | may be gone most of the night. This is a big mistake you're making Watson. Mark taught me to be a checker player. And | taught him to be a tracker. Now we out tracking but | always win the checkers. Hey, you must be slipping. For Gods sake. Time was you could tell my footsteps from anybody's. Well, | almost blasted you. | was going to drop off at the house to see how your day... went with Micah and | saw you driving away. Oh, great | was trying to be inconspicuous. Where is Micah anyway? She's down at the house with Watson. Why what's up? Sing. Sing? Yeah, we had a run in today. | got a feeling he's going to try something. Well, not to worry. | kept going. Hid the Land Rover next to yours. | knew you'd take the upper ground like | taught you. | imagine you like that young lady eh. Shit. | like living. Her | can do without. Yes, | like her too. Do you mind if | keep watch with you? If anything happened to Micah... I'd never forgive myself nor would Jane. | could use the company. Hey. Did you ever make it to Sacoma? | called John. He said he hadn't heard from you. | was with the President you oaf. All right so when's the plane coming? Tomorrow. You must be tierd. Why don't you close your eyes for a miuute. I'm here. - Give us your rifle. - | can't, we | can stay. Just rest for a moment. I'll wake you up come on. Just close your eyes. That's the way. Come om. Just Sing. | know you're there. Come on. Make your move. Mark. Mark. Where's your boyfriend? What does it matter? | got the bait. Now you scream ['ll cut your throat. Everything all right? How long have you been asleep? Asleep? | wasn't asleep. | just closed my eyes for a second. A second Huh. How all it was. There hasn't been a soul near the house all night. Well I'm going down there. I'll come with you. You son of a bitch. Sing was here in my house while you had... your eyes closed for a second. And where were you? | could have stayed awake. But you didn't. What the hells a matter with you lan? Sing has got Micah and | just hope to God she's still alive. Then you'll just have to go out there and get them won't you? Look at it this way Mark. This isn't just an ordinary kidnapping. Micah's famous. What are you talking about? Publicity. | knew if | could just get her to come up here and see what was going on. She'd make a noise the whole world would listen to. Than when | heard what she had to say about... Sing on the television... | know was the poacher | wanted her to see close to. She'll tell the world what there bastards are doing. You arranged for me to take Micah and you called Sing and told him to go Fred Johnson's knowing I'd show up there with her. But how in the hell did you know The elephants... would be out of the parks? You knew the elephats would be out of the parks... because you drove them out. And you played your part very nicely. My part huh! You're insane. Did you even go to Sacoma today lan? And what about Watson? That's just great. You've got a girl out there with a fucking mad man... and you killed my Watson you did. And it's for the fucking cause. Well, the cause is not worth that. Ah, but it is you see. You see it's not just a simple manslaughter this time. It's murder. Maybe even Micahs murder. Front pages everywhere. We'll probably save tens of thousands of animals. Don't tell me about saving animals lan. I've been fighting to preserve them all my life. But | will not be involved in the manipulation of... evidence like this and the creation for bullshit incidences. That's my friend. You self righteous bastard. You have no right to play God. All'l did was tell a few harmless lies. You, Micah and Sind did all the rest. That's human mature. Haterd. Greed. Love. Even, you can't track him in the dark. Never mind he'll wait for you. | inagine there's nothing he'd like... better than to get you alone in the wild. You son of a bitch. I'll take care of you when | get back. In the meantime you get a shovel. Bury Watson and do a good job lan. Or I'll come back and break your goddamn neck. Yes, Mark. Yes. You'll see. Lets see if you can catcn me now you son of a bitch! Eh. Leopards taken' the bait man! Come on, Mister Hunter! Lets see if you can hunt! I'm right. | know I'm right. I've got to be right. He's dead. | know I'm right. I've got to be rihgt. It looke like somebody's coming. Hey, it's Roger. Roger. Who's he got with him? Roger man who always did move fast. Ha ha Roger fast mover. Where's the smiling man? He's gone down to the bush. Ah, Tell him not to shit on the companies time in future. He's taken an elephant down there. How's that? Eh, That's good news. Now, there's another hundred elephants out there. That's 200 tusks.

Why are you doing this to mel. Is it because of what | said at the airport? Is that your reason! You're just bait girl. Even an animal eats what it kills. He kills for food nothing else. You're sock with greed that's why you killed that man. Not always Miss Hill. Today I'm going to kill for revenge and that might be sweetest of all. Are you going to kill me now? Or rape me first? There's no escaping girl. No escaping. Why did you shoot it for? Don't be impatient. | need you alive a little bit longer. Get in the... Canservation lady. Where's Roger?

You're going to have to pull the trigger. Go on. Shoot me. Or maybe you'd like to rape me first? Move over. You'd better get accustomed to killing Miss Hill. Prepare yourself to see your friend Mark being blown away. Which way? We'll never get the truck over. I'll take the Land Rover across. You carry the stuff over by hand. Good man, good.
