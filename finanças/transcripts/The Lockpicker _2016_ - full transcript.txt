(dramatic music) (lock rattling) (door banging) (door creaking) (unsettling music) - Hey, wake up. (banging on door) (electronic beeping) So, how did it go? - [Tess] Well, I was the only one who showed up, so I just went home. - [Hashi] I'm sorry I couldn't come. - [Tess] That's OK, just make it up to me. Write me another note. - [Hashi] Sure. I guess I could. I've been writing a lot of different poems. - [Tess] Are you gonna let me read them? - [Hashi] Yeah, if you want to, I guess - [Tess] Well, once you're done, hand them over. I'd like to read them. - [Hashi] Can we do a trade? You give me yours, I'll give you mine. (laughing) - [Tess] All right, I guess so. (electronic beeping) (chattering) - [Counselor] So tell me, do you spend a lot of time thinking about being in other places? - [Hashi] No. - [Counselor] Good. Do you feel like you want to be here at school? - Yeah. - [Counselor] Good. Have you had any extreme mood shifts or have you quit any of your commitments or activities? - [Hashi] No. - [Counselor] Good. Have you been fighting or crying uncontrollably. - [Hashi] No. - [Counselor] Have you been creating any artworks with themes of death or suicide? - [Hashi] No. - [Counselor] OK. Have you notice anyone else creating this kind of art? Or showing any kinds of fixation on suicidal thoughts? - No. - OK, good. If you do notice this kind of behavior, you should escort that person the the counseling office. OK? - [Hashi] OK. - [Counselor] Do you feel like you have a good understanding of what happened? - Yeah, I mean, like, I know what happened. - [Counselor] Well, have you talked about it in class? - Yeah, we talked. - [Counselor] Good. All right now, let's see. (muffled teacher talking) - But I want to ask what you really know about the world around you. So here's the plan, I want you to do one thing, one simple thing. Because technology, an invention, I want you to learn about it, research it, guys, and tell us about it. Where does it come from, how does it work? Kara, Lindon, come on guys, stick with me here. Listen guys. It's a difficult for the school right now. There's a lot of emotions and questions about what happened and we need to watch out for each other. And we need to-- (knocking on door) - Hi sir. - Oh, sorry. I forgot, right. No, come in guys, it's totally fine. Class, this is Josh and Venus. They will be telling us more about the summer sailing program. - [Josh] Right, so some of you guys might have heard of the trip. We're just here, we just brought some of these pamphlet thingies, with more information if you guys want. - Yeah, basically seven weeks out there in the water and you learn about the boat and the way of life. Yeah, you can get some job experience. I mean, you're gonna graduate soon, right? - Yeah, and sailing's really fun, you just get to go visit different ports, you get to go shopping and it's pretty amazing. - [Venus] It's really cool. - So yeah, if you guys want, we can give you guys some of the pamphlets. Yeah. - [Student] Thank you. - [Venus] So, we're gonna put some of these pamphlets over here. And just remember to sign on the pamphlets and bring it back to us with the money so that we can put your name on the list. OK, great, thank you guys, hope to see you. Thank you, sir. - Have a good day. - You too. (chattering) (electronic beeping) - [Venus] Basically seven weeks out there in the water and you learn about the boat and the way of life. Yeah, you can get some job experience. I mean, you're gonna graduate soon, right? - [Josh] Yeah, and sailing's really fun, you just get to visit different ports, you get to go shopping and-- (electronic beeping) - [Hashi] Hey Tess, I was thinking maybe, like, about life, right? - [Tess] What kind of life do you want? - [Hashi] I don't know, I just kinda wanted to be, just not this one. What about you? - [Tess] I want a completely different life. Almost everything different. I just wanna have a life where everyone's real. Everyone's honest and nice to each other. - [Hashi] What would you keep? - [Tess] Just a few people, I'd keep, only the one's close to me, maybe you. (chuckling) Well, you make me laugh, so that's good. - [Hashi] I wish there were more people like you out there. - Pardon? - Nothing. (dramatic music) (laughing) (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) - You were here. I had you for a moment. (dramatic music) (muffled arguing) (banging) - [Woman] You slept with me. (muffled yelling) You're a man, get out there and do what you're suppose to! - [Girl] They're OK? - Yeah. Go to bed, it's fine. (sighing) (teeth brushing) (laughing) (electronic beeping) I kinda wanted it to be, just not this one. - Yeah. - What about you? - [Tess] I want a completely different life, almost everything different. I just wanna have a life where everyone-- (electronic beeping) I want a completely different life, almost everything different. I just wanna have a life where everyone's real. Everyone's honest and nice to each other. - [Hashi] What would you keep? - [Tess] There's just a few people I'd keep. Only the ones close to me. (unsettling music) - Understood? Get to writing, guys. If you need any recommendation on newspapers to read, well talk to Jennifer in the back, she reads three a day. - Can I go to the washroom? (distant chattering) Hey Sara. - [Sara] Hey. - Are you going to work today? - Yeah, why? - We just missed our stop. - Oh fuck. Shit, what time is it? (bus bell ringing) - [Hashi] Do you want one? - Yeah, thanks man. I got it. Does he need a size? - [Customer] I think nine is pretty good. - [Sara] Nine is good? Did you want the other one? You can take a walk around to be sure. - [Customer] Yeah. - [Sara] You're excited to get these bad boys on? - [Customer] Yeah I just started a new job, excited. - Yeah? - Ready to work. - Sweet. There you go. - Oh thanks, have a good day. - Thanks, have a great day. See you again. Hey, we're gonna have to redo all of these now. - Why don't we just leave them for Greg? - Oh, that would be so good. Let's do it, let's just leave all of this for Greg. - None of these got the tag of them. You need to price those. - You wanna started? - Yeah, I'll get started. - Do you have a piece of paper that's says for Greg? - Yeah here, oh. - For Greg. - Do for with a four there. Yeah. - [Sara] Weed trees? - Have you never heard that, trees, as in like weed? That's a new one. People keep saying that to me. Yo, you got any trees, dog? I'm like, what? - [Sara] Do I have trees, do I carry a tree? - [Greg] Do I carry some trees with me, little leaves with me? - [Sara] A little evergreen, is that like a Christmas tree? (laughing) - [Greg] I'm afraid it's gonna hurt me. - [Hashi] OK I'm gonna let go, I'm gonna let go. - No don't let go. - Really, guys? Back to work you guys. - Do you think that Lorna would let me have a couple months off in the summer? - I don't know, probably, a vacation or something? - Kinda a school thing. Go down to Vancouver and like, you know, sail around on a tall ship. - Oh yeah, right, that's pretty cool. I mean, you can always ask her. If she doesn't, you can just quit and try to get your job back when you come back. She hired what's-his-face, Curtis, or whatever his name is back and he's shittier than you are so. (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) - [Tess] What kind of life do you want? - [Hashi] I don't know, I just kinda wanted to be, just not this one, like-- - Yeah. - What about you? - [Tess] I want a completely different life. Almost everything different. I just wanna have a life where everyone's real. Everyone's nice and honest and nice to each other. - [Hashi] What would you keep? - [Tess] There's just a few people I'd keep. Only the one's close to me, maybe you. (electronic beeping) There's just a few people I'd keep. Only the one's close to me, maybe you. (laughing) Well, you make me laugh, so that's good. - [Hashi] I wish there were more people like you out there. - Pardon? - Nothing. (dramatic music) (chattering) - You guys are up to start. (chattering) Back in line, let's go, let's go. Next up. And you're gone. You see that? The strongest girl is only half as good as the weakest boy. Just keep it in mind. (whistle blowing) (shouting) (chattering) - You a wreck or something, dude? You got something to beat? No? Dude, you're so fat! Yeah, 'cause he's gonna smother us to death with his giant titties. - [Boy] Right, Yeah. - [Boy] Dude, shake 'em - [Boy] Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the thing, do the thing. - [Boy] Yeah, dude, do the thing. - Come on! - Dude, do it. - [Boy] Dude, wiggle your tits, man. - We're not leaving till you fucking do it. - Aaron, just do it. (laughing) Aaron just stay right there. (slap smacking) (groaning) Did you hear it? - Yeah. Wait, no, don't be scared, just stay right there. (slap thwacking) (electronic beeping) - Damn, that stings. - Did you see the rolls? - I know, it's so gross. (slap thwacking) - [Boy] Oh! Oh, I can feel it! (laughing) Dude, are you crying? - Don't be a baby. - Come on, man. We're just kidding. - [Boy] Can't take a fucking joke? Like, what are you doing? You're just a bitch, fuck him. - [Boy] Yeah, he's a bitch. (chattering) We were playing the sea game because... (chattering) (coughing) (phone ringing) (electronic beeping) - [Tess] Write me another note. - [Hashi] Sure, I guess I can. I've been writing a lot of different poems. - [Tess] Are you gonna let me read them? - [Hashi] Yeah, if you want to, I guess. - [Tess] Well, once you're done, hand them over, I'd like to read them. - Hello. What are you working on? - Nothing, just reading a book, I guess. - You're not working on your presentation? - No. I'm gonna do it when I get home. I brought all my books there and stuff. - Hm, well OK. - Are we gonna have to learn driving by the stars if we get lost? - What? - For the sailing trip, if we get lost, are we gonna have to use the North Star and stuff for navigation? - No, they have instruments, I'm sure. - OK. So how long's the boat again? It's 40, 50 feet? - I'm not sure, to be honest. I'm sure I heard but I can't remember. - Are we gonna have to get food and bring it with us or we gonna have to get it along the way? Or are we gonna have to eat it and catch it? Then it'd be kinda weird, right? - I don't know, to tell you the truth exactly. But, I think they've been doing this for a few years now. So, they probably have everything ready to go. - Is it OK if I'm late on my payment for the ticket? I was thinking maybe I could take the bus or something. I mean, it'd be a little bit cheaper. I just thought, you know, if I could get it together, but, I don't know how it's looking now. - OK. You know you haven't been completing most of your assignments lately, right? - Really? - You need to start getting your work in and completing assignments before we can even talk about you going on this trip. You said you're going to work on your presentation tonight, right? - Yeah. - Well, let's start with that and then maybe, we can get some of the other assignments done that you've been missing lately. Get you back on track, OK? - OK, OK. - [Teacher] All right, keep it up. - Thanks. - I'll see you in class tomorrow. Get to work. (distant chattering) (electronic beeping) - You felt like this piece of blue sky future. I'm all day drawing this map to you. Like you're a country I know. A place that used to exist. Where do I go now? (bus rumbling) Did I tell you about chimeras yet? - No. - It's like when two twins sometimes, like before they're born, one of them will accidentally absorb the other one. And the only one baby's born And they'll have like two different colored eyes like two being there. - Weird. - Hey, turn around. - [Girl] OK. - Don't look. - I'm not looking. Hey. Hey. - What's up with your socks? Little hobo. - What? - I'll get you some new ones. There's these hugging socks and they're so amazing. They're like gloves for your feet. And they last forever. - Cool, thanks. - I need to get some waterproof gear anyways. I'm going on a boat trip. - With who? - The school. - We gonna go to Vancouver and you know, see a bunch of different places. Sail up, check it out and go. - Oh, when are you going? - [Hashi] This summer. - The whole summer? - Pretty much. It's cool, right? You gotta be ready for anything when you're out in the water. What? - [Girl] Nothing. (muffled arguing) (unsettling music) (chattering) - [Sara] Oh cool. (chattering) Cool, that's awesome, what do you play? - [Man] I play guitar, a little bit of bass. - [Sara] Yeah, that's awesome, really cool. - You guys would love it. - Well, when's your band play next? - We play next Thursday, at the Mino Lodge. - Oh cool, that's certainly a really awesome venue. What time are you guys on? - We play at like 9:00. - OK. - [Man] It's like six bucks. - Oh, that's that's totally doable. That's like an hour of working here. (laughing) Whatever, I just mean that-- - Is there anything else I need to take downstairs? - No, it's fine. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah, we're good. - OK. - Yeah, you should come. - OK, yeah, I think I will. - [Greg] I'm gonna head out after this, OK?

And then, I'm gonna go to this party afterwards. So I'm gonna head out after this. - What about the stock? - Fuck the stock, you'll be fine. You got Sara here, you guys can do it by yourselves, you'll be out of here same time, you know? You know Jay, right, the guy on my baseball team? - Nah. - He'd remember you.

Now you want to talk to me about how much money you've taken? - I took like 10 or $15. - A lot more than that's missing. Hashi come clean. - Maybe I took 20, I don't really know, but that's it. - Is this even your father's signature? This trip? - Yeah. - Yeah? OK. Now I haven't phoned the police as more than a few people think I should. You know Mr. Meikle, he says you're a good kid. He stood up for you. OK, here's the deal. If there's any reason I think you're falling behind, if you're missing class, actually if you're late for a class the police will be called, you'll be removed from the school. That's it, that's all. Do you understand that? (electronic beeping) - [Tess] There's just a few people I'd keep. Only the ones close to me, maybe you. I just want to have a life where everyone's real, everyone's honest and nice to each other. - [Hashi] What would you keep? - [Tess] There's just a few people I'd keep. Only the ones closet to me, maybe you. (laughing) Well you make me laugh so that's good. (dramatic music) - What did you think would happen when you did this? The police are gonna be here and they're gonna come take you away. Do you want that? Is that what you want? (unsettling music) (chattering) (chattering) - [Boy] You need to get better.
