Let me introduce myself: My name is Margarita, I'm the head of the Northern Clan of the Third Northern Fields. Right now we are running away with my secretary Misha and valet Vasily. We're trying to hide in the sector of the Thirteenth Hour. I'll tell you now what that is. A family legend says that there is a secret Lunar Clock in our park. It has an extra hour engraved on its face — the "Thirteenth" or "Twenty Fifth". And all family members possess this hour, where they will be hidden from the sky navigation, from Death itself. Nobody knows if that's true, but they say that our great grandmother disappeared on the thirteenth hour' vector in order to meet her beloved one after her death. I'd like to tell you my story so much! And I'll begin, I guess, at midpoint. Let's go back 30 years ago. That was a magical time, when the Great Matriarchy reigned. The women of our Northern Clan headed by Eternal Alice and me ruled in absence of men and lived waiting for them — strong and beloved. I for one dreamed about a grandson. Mother! Fannie has arrived! Come, Vasily. That New Year was the happiest, I think. Benedict, my son, was awaiting his fiancee Fannie so as to introduce her to our family. - Good evening! - Mother! This is my fiancee, Fannie. - Happy to meet you. - Very happy. I'm Margarita. - This is my sister. - Faina. - Nice to meet you! - I met Fannie's plane. Well, take off your coats. - Thank you. - Vasily, get the bags! Won't you be staying with us? No, I've promised our parents. - Well, that's it? - I'm off. I love you. - So long! - Time soon to sit down for dinner. Good bye! - Good bye. - See you. Vasily, champagne! This is my sister Lotta. Whenever she came back from the fields, she brought whatever she could lay her hands on. On that day she brought a stag that, she insisted, belonged to no one. Come on, move it. Here we go! Don't get stuck! Move it! Pakhom! Jeremy! Get rid of the ladder! And get a move on! The guests are on their way! And see to it that everything is picture perfect! - Are you here, Vasily? - Indeed I am. Fine... Fix the monograms! Will do! - Make sure everybody's got napkins. - Of course! - Prepare the champagne! - Will do! Marfa! To the kitchen! Hurry! Bring the fish! Wheel me to the tree! - Vasily, may I open it? - Of course! I'm the best Champagne opener! You are the best in everything! Here are the glasses. Where are you off to? Again, eating? You shouldn't! You've already eaten so much! I'm not on a diet! What diet?! Just look at your belly! Look at it. How will we ever give you away? Here! — throw it away later. Oh my God... What is it? Where did she find it? How can it just lie here in the everyone's way? Oh my God... We have to get him out, Katenka! He'll scare away all the guests... Get up! What a disgrace! Come on! He's so cute! You'd better just shut up! Cling to the wall! I always say you've got to lose weight! Where is your mother? Where did she find it? Come here. Is it a she or a he? Let me take a good look. Stay still! May I treat him to some chicken at least? Get out of here. He'll be poisoned. What? I've taken everything into account. Add this... Good Lord... And this... Are you crazy? Profligates! Parasites! Peculators! Go! Go! That's it! I can't bear it! And so we gathered together! This is our cousin Boris, who came all the way from Alaska for Benedict's and Fannie's engagement. On his right is my secretary, Mishenka. This is me, Margarita, sitting next to my sister Lotta, the keeper of safes and keys, and also a passionate fan of theatre and Indian cinema. This is my son Benedict with his fiancee Fannie. I can't remember if I've ever seen him that much in love. This is Ada, my sister Lotta's illegitimate daughter. My mother's companion is perched next to her. We simply call her Shadow. This is Eternal Alice, my mother, the chief of the Northern Clan of the Third Northern Fields. What windy night! And how the chandelier is swaying! Well! Have you all got pencils, paper, wishes? Mishenka, give them all pencils. You have to think up your wish for the next year and write it down and burn it quickly over your glass of champagne... ...and drink it with the ashes. But you must do it while the clock is striking midnight. Otherwise your dream won't come true. And you — Fannie? Have you come up with your wish for the next New Year? From this day on there is only one. If I choose the most important of all, it's that you, Benedict love only me. To the grave and beyond. Our toast, our family, our northern toast! Our toast! Yes! My glass is empty! Fannie, you must tell us how you met Benedict, when you first saw him... Once after landing the whole crew went to the airport cafe. We sat there for five hours because of the fog. And then you came in, Benedict. And our pilot, his buddy, called him over. And Benedict sat down with us, directly opposite me. And he started to look at me with such pity. Started to look at me with such pity. Started to look at me with such pity... I told everyone I had never kissed anyone on the mouth, which was the truth. I leaned across the table and kissed Benedict. On the mouth. And he kissed me back. And I couldn't stop that kiss. He moved over to me and we kissed until the fog cleared away. I really wish I didn't have to leave you! But I have a flight tonight. Remember, I told you? - I do. - Where are you flying to? - Somewhere over there! - She's hard of hearing. I'm a flight attendant! I've always loved planes. They say the two most important things are work and love. But it's work that wins. We'll buy a plane for Fannie, so that she doesn't fly away from us on foreign ones. We have enough money in the family and we'll buy a plane for you. And Fannie will give us a grandson. I've already chosen his name. His name will be... ...My Hugo. Why "My Hugo"? Why not "Our"? - Well, his name will be Our Hugo. - His name will be Our Hugo. - That's for me! - Mother? - Ada, who is there? - Wait, Benedict! - Mother is waiting for someone all the time. - Wait! Who can that be? Maybe it's for me. I don't know. Let Ada open the door and see who it is. - I need to talk to you, Margarita. - Go see who is there. - No, business first. - What business? Very important and intimate business. I was at church this morning for the sermon. And count Roman was there. He is very upset that you didn't invite him. He asked me to give you the present he prepared for you. - Count Roman? - Yes. - He is so wealthy! - How does he look? Now... The same as before. He is so rich. You could live with him now... No. How could you... ...accept this gift? Mishenka, go and return it right now. Immediately. - But... - No! I can't. I'm waiting... for someone else. You should know! You won't change your mind? I've been thinking a lot... No. I can't. Go, Misha! That was our clan's most important ritual, to be together every New Year, to give presents and make wishes. No one dared missing it because that was a harbinger of ill to come. - Happy New Year! - Congratulations! And our family clocks always struck thirteen times, scaring strangers sometimes with that extra strike. But we never invited strangers to our table. - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year, my dear! Thirteen... Champagne is medicine! Don't fly away from me tonight! - Is that an order? - No, I'm just asking. Just don't fly away from me ever again! I'm imploring you. There is my partner, Lilou! She's come to pick me up. - I'm putting on your earrings. - I don't want to let you go, Fannie. - I'll be back soon. - I'm not letting you go. No... No... No. - It's time to go. - I am beseeching you! - I have to go. - I am begging you, Fannie! But some day you will give me a plane. And we'll fly away. Lotta, what are you doing here? It's a telegram. Urgent. "We regret to inform you: the plane disappeared from the radar and crashed off the coast of... All passengers and the crew were killed, among whom... ...flight attendant Fannita Bolle. Please accept our condolence". I don't know how to tell him. But Fannie's elder sister Faina got there ahead of us. She sped to catch him at dawn with the horrible news that Fannie was killed. Why did she do that? Our clan never used banks. It was considered too risky by the family. That's why all of our treasures, including jewelry and bonds, were hidden in coffers which were then buried in our Northern Fields. Dig here! It's right here. This method was handed down from mother to daughter, from sister to sister. This was Lotta's family responsibility. Every New Year, using a special eyepiece, she checked on if those coffers were in the ground. And sometimes she would dig them up for our needs. Go, wait for me at the gate, I'll be back by evening. Throbbing... Throbbing... Weaker and weaker. Where is Ada? Where is Lotta? Where is everybody? It will soon be twelve. Is everybody here? Do you know that Lotta, your mother, has disappeared? Has anyone seen her? - She passed by the window an hour ago. - Really? Where is she? And once again. There's someone out there. Cousin!? A stranger is in the field moving towards us. - Wait! Is he in army uniform? - Let's shoot him! - Cousin Boris! - Hold on! He's in army uniform? Don't shoot! Maybe he's coming for me! We had no time to tell you, cousin Boris. We are waiting for a guest nobody knows but Margarita. That's what you should have said to begin with... Not only today, we expect him always because Margarita expects him every day. Benedict, but you know all that... I don't see anything. If I could wait like mother, it would pay off, but I have nobody to wait for. Mother, who have you been waiting for all your life? As long as I can remember myself. Who is that stranger? I doubt I will be around that long, so maybe you'll tell us? To you, mother. To hoping that little black dot in the field is him. - I ran to you like crazy. - My poor baby. The bullet whizzed by me into the field... That New year professor Zhgutick, the plastic surgeon, fell in love with Ada. And he proposed to her. When he arrived to meet the family, he immediately locked himself and Ada up in her room, much to our amazement. They stayed there for a long time, until the very New Year. Good God, where did you come from? Must be from Lotta... Lotta! Lotta, I know you are there. Lotta! What a wretch, open the door, please! I keep looking for you! Lotta, open up! Lotta! - I'm sorry! Forgive me! - Lotta, dear! What do you have here?! Good God... Lotta, when will you clean up this mess? Lotta, where is my safe? Have you dug it up? Yes! - It'll catch fire now. - What a nightmare! They rot through the safe, right through the metal. What can you do... It started to decay. Look... What can we do with this? I'll call the bank and demand new banknotes. What have you there? Let me sit down. - I can't continue like this. - Here, sit. Take it. I told you not to meddle... New Year's around the corner! This stench began when they sent the telegram about her death. Our bench in the garden started to decay when Fannie crashed. - I know. - The bench was the first to rot in the garden. Do you know that instead there's a black puddle of slush there? Yes! And it never freezes. Don't open it. I can't believe — a rat?! Indeed, a rat. Put it in here. I'll take it. But what if it's a thoroughbred? - Rats are never thoroughbred. - I'll figure it out later. - Mishenka?! - The singer has arrived! My gift! She's here? - Yes! Shall I let her in? - Absolutely! I'm on my way! - Come on... - He is letting her in! I have to go. Everybody's already there... Take this money, exchange it at the bank. Coming! Lotta, for Pete's sake! Listen, we'll talk later! - Don't worry! I'll handle everything. - Fine. Bye-bye. Coming, coming! - Margarita! - Who's there? - Wait. That's the singer, my gift! - Friends, open up, quickly! Hold the umbrella over the diva! No snow should fall on her! - Right away! - It's cold in here, be quick! That's for me! - Am I late?! - Everybody's been waiting for ages! - The snow knocks you off your feet. - Careful, the Diva has a long tail! - It's so cold! - Do you have her honorarium? - Of course. - Be careful! The Diva has a long tail! Everybody's been waiting for ages. Why are you so late? Too much snow. I began to warm up in the field just for you. No eating or drinking when she sings. Understand? I for one understand... - Take off your coat! - Yes, sure! - A shot of brew? - Yes! Give me some! ...brew! Give me more brew! The buggy, the buggy... Take off your coat. - They are all waiting. - Time to go, dear? Yes. Let's go. Pull the buggy over here. - How long must we hide here? - Mishenka, bring the buggy! - Everything's ready! - Come on, drive in! - I'm going to announce you now. - I'm ready. Vasily! Carry the Diva carefully! - Are you ready?! - Yes! Here is my New Year gift: opera diva! Happy New Year! Oh my God, what is this? Stop, what a raving beauty! Cousin Boris, behave yourself! - What a beauty! - He's our cousin. - Back off! No touching the Diva! - But somebody must touch her. - Cousin, behave yourself! - You'll see her off later. Where is such beauty born? Quiet! Here we go... Bravo! - I'll walk you out! - Thank you! - Happy New Year! - Thank you! I was never so happy to go out into a snowstorm! Cousin Boris, control yourself, please! What a fabulous... Lotta! I need to talk to you, just for a minute. Mother! Everyone, let's all take our seats at the table! Right now! I think such a present for cousin Boris is too expensive. - Good God... Look... - Benedict! - Look, he... - Lotta, pour one for me. - For the New Year! - And you? Yes, please. What did you call her? - I called her Yuyu. - That's pretty. Cousin Boris, so, did you see her out? What have you there? A piece of her dress? She dropped her tail trying to escape... Hold on. Escape? Tore off a piece of her dress on purpose for me to keep... - A kind of trick. - Care for a drink? Sure... She wanted me to find her. Like, in the theatre, after her performance, I come in full of guilt, I bring her tail, ask her forgiveness, even sew the tail back on. I'm good at sewing! I'm rich. I'm a colonel! Why are you staring at me? Are you serious? You ripped off the tail of the diva's dress, you idiot! And you are still sober! Well, so what, she was a New Year's gift and I am a military colonel! But I admired her! Appreciated, was blinded by her, that's how much I appreciated her. - Are you talking about her voice? - What voice?! She has no voice. Who cares? Voice, no voice. I admired all of her! Almost lost my sight. I started kissing her. Look — like this... Like this... Like this. I was sucked in... - I didn't want to release her hand. - I didn't wash... - Phew! What's that smell?! - I didn't wash... - I was with the dogs... - Jesus... - Washing something... - This is all wrong! Mother... - Mother?! - What? You are kissing yourself! I just want to recall how it feels when you kiss and somebody kisses you. Maybe I've forgotten... I read a book about a woman who kissed her own hand. I can't even remember when that was, but in the past century for sure. Now with my lips all I do is eat, drink and talk. And paint them. - Lotta, I'll kiss you. - Benedict, I'm your aunt! - I don't care who I kiss on lips. - Are you crazy? I am not your Benedict. Your Benedict has rotted like your coffer. - OK, stop it! - She is your aunt! The earth is rotting, he is right. - Cousin Boris? - Enough! Give me my share of the inheritance! Have you found his treasure chest? He's been asking for it a long time. I've been looking, but why does cousin need money? Why do you need money? I'm getting married. - To whom? - To a singer. - Really?! - I'll save her from you! So she won't be humiliated, won't be wandering around fields all night or sitting in a car with the assistant. And the assistant by the way, will live with us. - Did you hear that? - Let her live. Right, mother? Lotta? I'm against! - At least let the assistant live there. - Time for dinner! - Meat anyone? - Good God, how sucked in I was... "Sucked" – what kind of a verb is that? I don't understand. Cousin Boris, God knows what, tore off a piece of the singer's dress. - But she wanted that! - Outrageous! Hugo! Hugo! Hugo! - Meat anyone? - Hugo! Chicken breast? Who wants a piece of meat? Cousin? Doctor Zhgutick, you've graciously agreed to tell us your love story. - Yes! - How did you fall in love with Ada? I suddenly saw something ideal, a dream. No! You're not telling it in detail. I came in, uglier than ugly, and you jumped up and gazed with delight at the ugliest part of my face, my nose... Yes, I can't forget that nose of yours. To make a long story short, I met my Muse. I was thunderstruck. This is very personal, but... ...I've kept the nose that I cut off in alcohol as a memento. By the way, that plaster can come off. Doctor Zhgutick, and what to do with that excess weight? Bariatric surgery comes next. Ada! Does it hurt?! And where is your wife Faina, Benedict? - Where? - I don't know. She is fake. Her eyes and everything else... I told you. And you said that when she sits sideways, her left and right profiles are absolutely identical to her sister's. Here and there, by the way, she is a copy of Fannie... She loves you so much! You know love is infectious and you will love her back. - Benedict had a fiancee, the beautiful Fannie. - But aunty... And when her plane crashed, he decided to marry out of grief... marry her sister... And what did I say? Speak up, I can't hear you. I'm saying "I hate!" Do you hear me now? - Now I hear you. - We hear you now. She follows me everywhere, looks for me, keeps interfering... During the break she comes for lunch, stares, huddles in all the corners, in the room next door, in bed, weeps and stinks. She spreads her stench everywhere. She gorges, lunches all day and then suddenly has dinner. What's that stench? She has an awful perfume, probably you gave her your dated perfume? - That was wonderful perfume! - Listen to me! The smell of ammonia comes from her body. You mean, you haven't noticed? She can't digest her food fast enough, so it seeps out through her pores like fumes in a swamp. Did you see the pores on her nose? She paints them over. Every day she has two hard boiled eggs for breakfast. She sits opposite me and sticks her wet hand on my cheek, let's off that smell again and shakes and breathes on me. I'm about to throw up! Ok, let's talk not about food! I came into my room yesterday and she was standing by the window wearing Fannie's raincoat! I forbade her to touch Fannie's things. I hide them, but she steals them, puts them on and pretends to be her sister. Benedict! Turn around. So... - Happy New Year everybody! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Alice, dear! - Happy New Year, dears! - Mother, Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! My beloved grandson Hugo grew up. The house became dilapidated, overrun with bushes. The fields no longer peaceful, they decayed along with Lotta's treasure chests. The government kept changing, it was wobbly and erratic. And so another New Year came to our Northern fields. We prepared to celebrate. - Yes! - Lotta had prepared everything for us! New Year is coming soon! All the branches in the garden iced over and broke. Mishenka, you move like a snail! - Out we go, Margarita! - Lotta! Yes! At last... - Lotta! - At last the New Year is upon us! All the twigs in the garden have iced over... - Where is everybody? - Mishenka, bring the gifts! - Where are the gifts? - I'm carrying it! Champagne for everybody! - Where is everybody? - Where is my Hugo? Mishenka, put the presents under the tree! And Champagne! Where is the champagne?! - Like in Alaska! - Champagne! - Is everyone here? - Yes! - New Year's coming soon! - We're like in Alaska! Now it's my turn to give presents! My New Year present is... ...an airplane! That's my present. Come on. Lotta, where is My Hugo? - Hi! - Hugo, they are all waiting for you. - No matter what, he gave her a plane! - Indeed he did... Here's my New Year present! So that you fly, learn to fly... ...like Fannie. Fly, fly... ...back and forth... ...back and forth. Fly like Fannie! Fly in Fannie's honor! And finally fly off somewhere! Mother, champagne... Ada! He's crazy. Come on inside! New Year is coming soon! - Come, mother! - Come, everybody. Cousin Boris, come to the table! - What a beauty! - What a beauty! - Come on inside! - Come, everybody! Quicker! Hugo! - Mishenka, you are welcome as well, come in! - Thank you, Lotta. - Hugo! - Hugo, come with me! My Hugo, your father is very drunk. Come with me. "Fannie" Margarita, you are beautiful! Misha, has anybody called me today? I may have missed it. No, nobody called. Oh, there you are! What are you eating here? Eggs? But you had dinner and breakfast and lunch. Let me tell you... I must teach you how to open a bottle of champagne or wine. And if you are married to my Benedict, it's your duty to open bottles. Like your sister Fannie. She was the best at that... She was the number one opener of champagne. Mishenka, bring the Burgundy. Well... Faina, I was certain he would come to love you in response to your loving him so much. I love him even more. Not that much time has passed, but as time passes he will forget you. No! I mean, he will forget her. I still can't forget her either. What am I guilty of? No, no... Is it my fault? She is dead and I'm alive! - Yes... - Will he forget her? In the course of time... In the course of time we forget almost everyone. How long must I wait? It hurts so much when you are not loved. Tell me, when he... ...when he asked you to marry him... ...did he tell you that he doesn't love you? When he proposed, he said he'd call me by her name. He said he would transfer his love for her to me, that nothing would change. He feared the truth that much? Didn't want to suffer or lost his mind from grief? Poor Benedict! He was so afraid of not surviving her death. But he keeps telling you that the real Benedict is dead. Can't open it. Don't you listen? That that Benedict is gone. Did he want to continue loving Fannie?! You know, in this family we love only once. So if you love only one person, she can have only one name, right? Just one name. I've broken everything. - You should screw it in! - I'm screwing it in! Faina, you have to twist it and put the bottle on the floor and push... and open it like this! How can one be so obtuse? It's high time you learned how to open champagne or wine! Margarita, it's useless! Sorry... And now yank it. Yank it out. And now I want to take her name! What do I care which name it is. He is more important than a name... Sometimes he asks me to sit in profile, asks me to put on her shoes and raincoat. But that's when he's tipsy. When he's drunk he pities me... Really? But when he's really stoned he doesn't recognize me. He asks: "What's your name?" I answer: "My name is Faina". And then he gives a shiver and says: "That's not a name. It's a needle". Yes... Does he tell you, what should you do, if you are a needle? He asks me to forgive him. And I always do. And I say: "I love you, love you, love you". For all his words, just that... I can't open it. That's because I don't drink like you do! Did you hear that? Yes. But we have to do something with her. She tortures my Benedict. Five years passed. The plane never got off the ground and was decaying outside our windows along with the family house. When Hugo was born, I thought the family would finally acquire a man... But the matriarchy era continued. Something happened to the men's blood. They remained children. And My Hugo wasn't growing up. Don't look at me. I'm not looking, Hugo. Excuse me. - Who has the first toast? - I have a toast! - Go. - Let's drink to mother! Not to you, but to the mother of my son Hugo! Where is she by the way? Have you seen her? Ah, you're here? - Ada! - Where is Ada? What's wrong with you? You were almost late. - What's going on?! - New Year is coming! - Is she here? - There's only us. - What's wrong, Zhgutick? - Would you like a piece of meat or chicken? What's going on? Why are you silent? How many times must I ask? - After certain events... - My God, what is he doing?! I have no appetite and can't get drunk... - Hide dad's gun from me! - With pleasure. Good God, what's going on? What's wrong with you? Where is my daughter?! Professor Zhgutick, pull yourself together! Benedict! - What's going on?! - Hold on to him! - Ada isn't here! - Margarita, stay away from him! Oh my God! Do you know, that Ada, my wife, - your daughter... - What? after the last surgery she got into the habit of joining various ladies' parties - and getting drunk there! - So, we know and...? - Do you? Do you?! - So, we know and...? I kept looking for the reason, why so often, all night, 'till 5 in the morning! Granny! Grandma, I'm shaking... What?! "Granny"?! - How dare you call me "granny"! - Get him up! How dare I?! She cheated on me! Bitch! Bitch! - Help! - Grab him! - Tie up the scoundrel! - Bitch! - Professor Zhgutick! - Hold on to him! - The rogue! Now lift him up. Mother, I'll be in the plane. See... if his face is still whole. - Would you like a drink? - Get up! It will soon be New Year. What's the problem? But I told you... - ...that parties for women... - He shouldn't drink! I told you... Leave me alone! ...that parties are for women. She is having... ...an affair... ...with a woman. What? That's impossible. Where did you get so drunk, Zhgutick? Alice, there is such a terrible shortage of men now that such things do happen! Let him get up. I'll go look for Benedict. Hold on to him! Here is Ada. Ada! Your husband is out of his mind. What have you done to him? What has she done to me? Ada, he said that you... - ...and some woman... - Some woman! Yes. Sarah. Sarah Navikat? Such a strange surname! - Yes. - But she has a husband, children. They recently moved to the 3rd Street of Northern Poets. Is it her? Yes. I have a feeling for her. A feeling?! But why does he suffer so? What kind of a feeling is that if he feels so bad? May we discuss it without Alice, please?! No! I'm staying here for sure now! I'm intrigued! She fell in love with Sarah, isn't that obvious? I see. I had much the same. I just don't remember her name. A tennis player, married to a banker... She wrote me... ...love letters. - Mother, did you hear that? - I did. Sarah... but she is not at all chic. When I see her in those bluish scarves, always bluish, and with blue handbags. It would never cross my mind that someone might desire her. Remember how she looked when I got her. You're a perfect couple, two hags. I'll give you the jar with your cut off schnozzola for your engagement! Sometimes this blue dot romantically runs down our alley and drops in on you, Ada. Where are you running off to, Ada? If you had told me, I too would run off with you. - My God, it's New Year soon! - To the table, everyone, to the table! - We have to write down our wishes. - Hugo, where were you? Come on! - Dad! I've made it in time! - We must write down our wishes. Yes, darling, you've made it! - We are writing! - Mother, be quicker! Yes, yes! Have you made a wish? Let everything come true! - Here it is! - Happy New Year! Thirteen, our thirteen! - Our thirteen! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! - Ada, why are you so sad? We have that extra hour, the thirteenth or the twenty fifth. Hugo! Give us a toast! Dad, what's more important, words or actions? Legs, hips... - ...profile, breast... - Words... ...a farewell look! I don't know, Hugo. A word! Just one word! Benedict, I am begging you. Don't you want to call your wife Faina? I don't want to. I hate her. I solemnly swear to love all of you to my death and after in the Northern way. Our toast, our family, our northern toast! Ada! It's either her, or the family. The same night Professor Zhgutick gave Ada a sleeping potion and in revenge sewed back on her old long nose. And Ada left our house, and never parted with her beloved Sarah. She visited us just from time to time. Her jilted husband remained with us but from that time on felt hatred for anything blue. When will you paint the car another color, how many times must I ask? - But we've repainted it. - What? It's still blue! Well, we'll repaint again... Come in. Have you brought it? - Come in, come in! - Mikhail, watch your tone. Put it in the fridge! Good God... Margarita, I've got news. May I come in to report? I'm coming. Benedict has come from the factory walking straight without wobbling. No other news? No. A strange group of characters has arrived. Yes, indeed, saw them. They have shovels, like our Lotta. I was surprised and worried about Lotta's treasure chests... - and about ours. - They walk around the house. So I came out wondering who they were? Turns out, scientists. They are here to research the abnormal rotting of the fields. How do I look, have I gotten much older? Not at all, each of us has his or her aging speed. You look sensational! I suspect we are heavy drinkers. Heavy drinkers... ...but beautiful. - Who is it? - Should I start roasting the goose? - What? - Get out of here! - Roast who? - The goose. - I'm sick of them... Roast it! - Let her roast it. Don't be rude. I'll try to control myself. God, I'm so sick of all of them. I'm tired. Mishenka, and you... ...are you in love with anybody now? No. You remember I've told you about my previous muse. It's over. There are only idiots all around. What's to be done? I'm searching. Didn't he even call you? - Didn't he call? He didn't call? - Not once... The hell with him! - Shall I bring more champagne? - Yes. Mishenka, I'll go stay alone for a while, OK? I understand, my dear... - Put up my board as usual. - Understood. Hold on... Like that... - It's beautiful like that. - I'm switching it on. Yes. Don't take away the champagne. - I'll pour some more? - Yes, please. Call me if you need me. Gotcha, you bastard! - C'mon down! - I was just wiping off the dust! - It's dirty here. - You sponger... - I'll explain everything, Lotta! - Get out! - I'll explain everything! - Parasite! Margarita! Here is my New Year present. This is a great gas! It's a substitute for Argentine morforodorizat. Usually it's for surgery, and certain dosages make you really high. I've tested it on myself. It's concentrated. Mikhael, hold it. Be careful. Margarita, lie down. - Are you ready? - Yes. If possible, it would be best if all others left the room. I'm starting to pump. Are you feeling it? Inhale deeper! Breathe. Margarita, is the room growing? I'm pumping more for maximum effect, OK? Breathe. Relax. I suffered so much because Benedict was not able to forget Fannie and was not able to love Faina. I couldn't forget her myself. She came to me in my dreams, visions, everywhere. She haunted me in my memories. How unfair that she left us so early. It seemed as if she would not allow us to forget her. Benedict, you're poisoning yourself! You are poisoning... Let go, you're hurting me. It's you who should let me go. Benedict, can you talk to me at least for half a minute? I love you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... ...6, 7, 8, 9, 10... - ...11, 12, 13, 14, 15... - Calm down! ...16, 17, 18, 19, 20... ...21, 22, 23, 24, 25... ...26, 27, 28, 29, 30! You are homely. Phew! Vasily! New Year is coming. Where is mother? Where is Lotta? Where is everybody? Open it! Money! Money! It's warm. Very warm! Pakhom, the money, it's hot from inside. Shut it! The money... The money's rotted. Carry it to the house! Carry it to the house, you spongers! The money is rotten! The fields are rotting. Everything is rotting! My money is rotten! My money... I don't know, may be water filtered into the coffer. Here it is... Who gives a damn... Shut up, I'm not interested. Look... Here I see serial numbers. Write them down... Five... Five... Can you see? What follows doesn't matter, there's a seven, one seven... Only seven... yes... Yes... Hello! Hello? What a lousy connection? Come. Are you from the bank? From the bank? Everything's fine, your director has arrived seemingly... - ...from the bank. - From the bank. And you are fired! Take this. Tell Jeremy not to wipe the black spot on the floor. You can still see the bills' numbers there... Move! Move! Move! Wait! Wait. Do I have a last wish? Of course, you do, this is not an execution. Oh, please, don't! - What? - I was in the theatre a year ago. I'm theatre lover. There was a tour of some theatre, and one actor played... - What actor? - An actor from India. And I fell in love with him. I want to go to India. To him. Can you introduce me to him? He is so handsome. And nobody ever loved me and I never loved anybody. How can you say that? I love you. I want to go to India just to see him. Can you introduce me to him? Can you? Let's go. Go over there and sweep... the floor. Come here. Just for a minute. Come. You know, you all talk about orgasms... But I never had an orgasm... Listen... I just want to go to India and see him. - Can you introduce me to him? - Yes. OK. That's it. I can manage it from here. Go. I... I'll call you from there. I'll take care of everything. Go! My sister Lotta died that year. A war broke out in the Northern Fields, our factory was blown up. They called Cousin Boris to the headquarters. And he was killed by a stray bullet there. Our relative who had forgotten her name got through to our house and started to help Benedict. Our estate became poorer, but we held on to the tradition of ringing in the New Year together. Margarita, I have a toast. My Hugo. Since childhood I dreamed that one day everybody would leave the house and the phone would ring... I'd pick it up: "Who are you calling?" And I'd hear the voice: "May I speak to Margarita?" And I'd run to you and calmly say: - "It's him calling". - "Him?" So we are waiting for a man's voice! How do you call that, Margo, at least when you do expect, how do you call that? This is to Love. And I... ...make the same wish every year... ...but it never comes true. My wishes also never come true, dad. Only one wish... Let me go. Do you love me? Do you? Just say that you love me, and then I'll let you go. How miserly. Benedict! But you're killing yourself! On the contrary, that's my medicine. By the way, have you noticed that she never flew by plane? It has completely rotted away. Once a month I buy a trip to Paris, anywhere in the world, money's no issue, but she refuses to fly! Mother, I gave her a plane. In honor of her sister, have her fly away. So that I crash like Fannie? You are not Fannie! You pretend to be her, and I pretend to be Benedict. But there is no Benedict! He is dead! He crashed into a rock. He choked on a bone! Where is the war now? - Benedict, the war is everywhere now. - Everywhere. Mother, do something! I'm begging you! Yes. Dear Fannie! Dear Fannie! I am... I am Faina! I... I am Faina! Sorry! Forgive me... ...for calling you by her name. Forgive me. I love you very much! I love you so much. I love you so much, but allow him to divorce you! Let him divorce! No! - No! I can't! - You can! - No, I can't! - Yes! Let him divorce. You stink! You stink! You all hate me! I'm not the only one who stinks! She does too! She stinks! You stink! What? - You stink! - What? Someone, wash her, she stinks! - Are you crazy? - Don't shake the floor! You stink! You stink! Mother, where are you going?! Vasily! Pour me champagne! She stinks! Misha! Stinks! Oh! This is terrible! Nothing's terrible, my fiancée – she is alive. Well, yes, there is no tomb... It's time you changed the portrait, this one is all wrinkled. I know. I have a back-up. - Just two minutes to go. - We'll make it, my dear... It's just so interesting, how many times will it strike tonight? On that New Year I left the table and decided to meet our thirteenth hour on the highest roof of the Northern Fields along with the main clocks. I had nobody else, only the valet and the secretary. The branches are not frozen tonight. And there is no snow. Now we shall verify everything... One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen! Everything is going to be OK. Tea, please. - Here... - Give me a light. You know... ...your mother... ...loves your father Benedict so much. And he will absolutely... come to love her, too. Love is infectious. Come on. - My Hugo. I love you. - I love you too. Come on. Margarita here... Hello? Wrong number. - Again? - Yes. Would you like me to tell you the truth? All your life you have been waiting for someone. The one you're waiting for will never call you. Never. When will you finally croak? I'd like to get Fannie back. There had to be some kind of error because of the snowstorm or lightning. That plane crashed, but her body was never found. Isn't it possible to get her back in a similar body? And my Benedict would be happy at last. That never happens? Just one single girl dies an unjust death and chaos comes to the Northern Fields. The fields rot, power passes from one to another and belongs to none. Nobody loves anybody and nobody is happy. And all this began when she was no more. Could it be that she was that magical and irreplaceable element of the Northern Fields without which life rots away just like Benedict's did without love? Well, what now? There's nothing but animals in the wings. But I found her. She's coming. - Well. - Would you like a drink? Whatever! Now, look... Most important, don't insult her so she doesn't refuse. - For that much money? - I wouldn't put it past you. And have her call in your presence. Otherwise she'll take the money and botch the call. OK. Here she is! But she doesn't look like her at all. At all! It's her voice that's important, not how she looks. Matilda is a local star. Her voice is exactly the same, just listen. No names, please. I've got a very short break. Well, then have a seat. We want to talk to you. Have they told you about the texts you are supposed to say on the phone? Yes. Who wrote this? What's it to you? Well, we could edit it a little if you're not happy with it. No, no. When should I call? Right now in our presence, we need to hear the quality, the reaction, the result on the other end of the wire. - Right now? - Yes. No, I'm not yet ready, I... I need to rehearse... I need some privacy. - That's fine. - Anything else? The only thing that we can tell you is that the voice belongs to a woman much younger than you. I couldn't care less! The hell with all your details! I need to rehearse. Pull myself together. And don't follow me around, I'll call you. What did she say? Where did you find such an uppity actress? The voice. - What? - I picked her for her voice. She's not the most talented but the most troubled. Don't follow me around. I'll call you. I need privacy. "They say you're married... ...and what's his name? ...what's your husband's name? ...what's your husband' name? ...how do you call him?" Hello. Faina, it's me! - Your sister Fannie. - No, no. More tenderly. Stop, I don't need that. I got it... It's me, your sister. I didn't crash. I didn't crash. I am alive. And you? I'll come by tonight. I was lonesome. And you? What about you? They say you got married. To whom? What's your husband's name? How do you call him? What's your husband's name? Don't call here. Don't call here! Don't call here! I think that's enough for the time being. - That was OK, right? - Right. The same every day? Yes, every day. - Three times every morning. - Every morning... And twenty times at night after the performance. - At night?! - Yes, at night, my dear! From twelve to three. OK. What about the pay? You want the full one hundred percent, right? - Right. - Here it is, you can count it. That will buy you a fur coat. Thank you! Indeed, we live in a terrible climate, so cold! - Well, my dear, you may go. - Thank you, mam. Will you handle it yourself if you need to kill? We've got bad people to do bad things. That's for sure. - Terrible climate. - Yes, terrible. Take care. Thank you, mam. We'll keep an eye on you! Be my guest! Mother, did you call me? No. That was your imagination. - Mother... - It was a wrong number. - Who was it? - Why aren't you in bed? You need to sleep. Hello? Faina! Faina, don't you recognize me? Faina, it's me, your sister. You know, I'm alive. Don't call here anymore! Stop calling! Faina... Faina... It's me again. Stop calling! Faina! Faina, what are you doing here? - I'm talking! - Are you? What's that around your neck? I've just imagined how you'd find me hanging here in this room. How you'd all be glad. How you'd heave a sigh of relief. Where did you get the rope? Where did you get that rope? Don't touch it. Give it back to me. It's my rope, I bought it with my own money, not with yours. What do you want? What do all of you want from me? I'll take it... Hello. Faina? - No, it's not Faina. - Has something happened?? No, she's left, left forever. Don't call this number anymore. Ever. - You understand me? - Yes, I understand. Good. So... ...it's you who's been calling me? No. I... I never called you. On the contrary — I've stopped it. Isn't that clear? It's you who's been calling me with her voice. A voice so similar to Fannie's, but the words are yours. I recognized you. You tricked me. I didn't trick you. I... You pretended to be kind And tricked me. Yes, I tried to be kind to you. - But you can't? - I can't. I can't! What do you want? Here is a pen. Leave Benedict, go away. Leave and disappear. Leave this house. No, I will leave only if he asks me to, not his mother. He does ask. What is that? It's a request for divorce. I asked him for a postponement. When was it? I've just talked to him this morning! A year ago! I asked and begged him! Those terrible calls... I first believed them. Come here... What shall I do now? Where is Benedict? - He's left. - Why is he hiding from me? Let him say this to me face to face! He hasn't yet returned. But it's night now! Where did you get these papers?! They are old, they are not valid, they are not authentic, are they? I won't leave! And I won't give him a divorce. Hanging myself is no problem. I've bought the rope. Let's have a drink! But I love you. How silly you are, I do love you! I do. Together, we'll drink together now and then we'll go meet Benedict in the field. He'll be arriving right now. You got a little dirty. We'll go meet him together. And we'll go to the town and go to a restaurant. But I need to put on some lipstick and change. Yes, you will paint your lips and change. Well, I have to change. Yes, now drink, drink! I'll change... ...in a minute. And... I'll wait for you in the car! Are you here? - Is everything ready? - Yes. Fine. Give me the champagne. Faster. Faster. She's coming right now... As soon as I give you three signals, if things get bad... - duck down, hide... - Got it! Here she comes. Be ready. Oh my God... What took you so long? The champagne's ready. Have a glass. Let's clink them. Now we're off to the field. I checked on Hugo, he's sleeping. Everyone is. - Everyone is sleeping. - I can't leave. Of course. Of course you can't leave just like that. Just... Just tell me: how much? - Just how much?! - What do you mean? All you have to do is simply sign this. Just sign it. Just sign that you agree to divorce him, and all the money is yours. We'll go to the field now... Here, sign it. Because you really do love Benedict so much. I hate him! I hate you all. Oops! It got torn up. Oops! It flew away. Benedict belongs to me, not to you! When will you finally croak? Why are we standing here? Let me out! My door's stuck. You know, it's true, it really is. One of us must die. You're right. What a terrible woman! What has she done to us? I'm an evil man, even worse. I'm your man, I'm yours. Look at me, the snow falls. For God's sake! What's happened to Faina? It's horrible, cousin! She was hanging from the ceiling, swaying back and forth and we thought, if she's swaying, she must be alive. But you see... Well... And Lotta also died... Well... Cousin, let's go in. Let's go in, New Year is coming. Have you retired? Yes, I'm retired. I'm going to live with you now. She hung there from the ceiling and she was swaying. And we thought she must be alive if she's swaying. And it took so long to cut the rope. And when we managed to – that was it. I'm leaving. I'm leaving this house. Hugo, aren't you going to bury your mother? No. I promised to love you all. - It didn't work out. - Hugo, I love you! If you leave, I'll die. You're mine, everything was for... It's not my fault, please forgive me. No. I won't forgive you. There's war in the North, I'm joining the regiment. Hugo, I loved your mother. I swear I did. I swear I did. We'll bury her together. Please, don't leave. Forgive me! - Forgive me! Forgive me! - I know everything. Absolutely everything. It's not true. It's not true! Why do you believe everything they say? It's not true. That's all. Tell them to remove it. Vasily... ...you still haven't seen Benedict? Has he not come out of his room? Benedict with the servants has again gone out to his plane. I'll sit here a bit. That's it. Of course, my Hugo will never return. He'll be killed. He never did learn to be strong. And Benedict didn't even notice that his son has gone to war forever. It's been a long time since he noticed anything. And his main occupation is that rotten plane that he bought in honor of his beloved Fannie. He painted it anew every New Year. But at least he had a hope. My matriarchy continued. Servants, show yourselves! That's it! Wheel it! Stop. I think that endless New Year will never ever end. And no matter how long I wait, it will be all for naught... One day I'll wake up in the next new life to wait for you here. Or is that just a dream? Or does each and every one of us have that extra hour, the thirteenth, where we are stronger than death. For the sake of love. "The Thirteenth" station
