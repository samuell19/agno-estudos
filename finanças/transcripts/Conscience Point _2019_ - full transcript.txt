(upbeat music) (tense music) - [Woman] Morning, hi how's everything? - [Woman] Good morning, grandmother. We're ready to get ready. - Good morning Popsy honey wash day, my baby. Henry hurry, hurry, hurry. Give me one second he'll be right here. - Love you. See you later. - Shinnecock Nation is a small tribe, on the reservation 500 people or so. And we're surrounded by the wealthy folks who are living on our land. As native people, you feel a responsibility to your ancestral territory, to protect the land as much as we can. It's nearly impossible in this day and age, but we're still gonna do the best we can. (upbeat music) - We're a Maritime Community. People are coming here with large amounts of money. The conflict now is overdevelopment. - More often than not, I hardly recognize this place I call home. - In the last 10 years we've lost right away to the bank. - This property was transferred from the town without the town board, understanding this agreement. - You watch what happens with all this preserve land. They're gonna be encroaching on it. They're gonna be put in driveways through it. - [Man] That guy down there changed that place into his Hamptons. And you took our Hamptons. - Now I feel so alone today. I feel what the farmers are feeling. I feel what the people are feeling. We're gonna do something about this. - Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful today. Little blue, Jay. No, that's a woodpecker. What is that? These are mostly clamshells. We are at conscience point. This is where our Shinnecock ancestors met the first Europeans pilgrims. Some people say, my family's been here for four, five, six generations well, we've been here 400 generations plus. As far as land was it was just a total different way of thinking, like to own your land, we're just caretakers. I love this spot because it is beautiful and it is preserved land over there, but it's a good place to commune with the ancestors and let them know how much we honor and respect and care for them, try to be good people and think about them. (upbeat music) For at least of last century. The Hamptons has been a spot for the wealthy, to get away from the hustle and bustle. They can drive their limousines right past this indigenous community and not even know that we exist - We're small community. We're finite in this greater community of the Hamptons. The land base that we have here is approximately 1200 acres. This is a small piece of our original territory. Our original territory extended from the East Hampton town line, all the way to the Brookhaven town line. One of the first things that we did as a people in 1640 when the first settlers arrived is we gave them eight square miles of land to use which is now current day, Southampton village. And we've paid the price for it ever since. Here we sit, in the middle of lifestyles of the rich and famous, and yet 60% of our people in our community are below the poverty level. That's a problem. (upbeat music) - You know, Modell's shopping stores. That's Modell's house. It's funny the people that live out here. You see this house right here, house on an acre, that's $8 million right there. That huge house back there, I sold to a 29 year old, 10 years ago for $15 million. The owner of COACH just built that house he paid $25 million for the land, right there, and a farmer sold it that owned it for hundreds of years. It's a crazy place. Almost everybody who's successful financially in New York, they wanna be here. So when you have a lot of people chasing not that much property, it just keeps going up. But there's something about it out here that they all wanna come. I just happened to enter real estate in 1996. And I call it the best 20 years in real estate in 10,000 years. We were selling $18 million houses in '06 and '07, the hedge fund managers, like they were candy being a finance guy, I like to turn things quickly. I call it the velocity of money. The big complaint out here is overdevelopment. And I agree with them, but people are gonna continue to want homes and buy homes. This and the next generation deserve the house pool and tennis in the Hamptons. That's how I see it. - This is a very unique area, besides having a population of close to 60,000. That's a year-round population. In the summer months, it quadruples and it's very culturally diverse and economically diverse. We have some of the wealthiest people on the planet, heads of multinational corporations, the 1% of the one percenters. Then we also have very modest people who work two or three jobs to deal with the high costs of living here. So the disparity between rich and poor is probably no greater anywhere else than right here in the town of Southampton. And of course that makes things complicated because you have to serve and protect all people. (door creeks) (door slams) (crunches) (clanking) (birds chirping) (bang) (birds chirping) (engine revving) - My family's been out here since the early 1700s. I grew up in a farming fishing community. It's still gorgeous place, don't get me wrong, but it's pretty much been bought out. (rattles) 20 years ago, that would have been stuffed with scallops for weeks. It's called Sputnik grass. It's gotta be the only thing that every scallop larvae has to hide in these days. It's heavy. With all the toxins that are going into the bays it makes it really difficult. God knows what goes into these bays. In the morning you see him spray vector spray for mosquito control. Feel like ah, juvenile fish eat mosquito larvae. That's how that whole cycle works. A lot of the locals back in the day didn't really wanna build on the water. That's why land next to the water was so cheap because there was too many mosquitoes you get eaten alive and now everything is kind of changing ecologically there's no mosquitoes. Well, that's why there's no juvenile fish kind of making their way back up into the marshes and stuff like that. The Shinnecocks are the only ones that have respectably kept it, updeveloped. If you look at the Bay, around where the reservation it's gorgeous and then everywhere else has been built up on so, I mean. For me, it has basically destroyed my livelihood the development on the bay. - See you guys later. We're gonna go over to where the fish usually show up in the early season. What I do catch, I eat myself. I also give it to people for free, free of charge up here on the reservation. I do the same thing with hunting. I shoot a couple of deer, I shoot a few ducks. I give them away to people here on the reservation. People like it. My dad taught me that. (door thuds) (swishes) (rattles) One of our traditional ways at the end of a prayer or at the end of the ceremony, we say, (speaks foreign language) Which means all of my relations. And when you're saying all of my relations you're acknowledging the connection not just between your immediate family, but you're acknowledging the connection you have to everything, all of creation and that what you do with one thing affects the other thing. There's actually different kinds of fish than there were when I was a kid, and I was out there right in front of Calvin Klein's house, actually, and I pulled up a sand shark in the boat right next to me pulled up a sand shark too, he was like, "I've never seen the sand shark and Heady Creek, "other than me!" (laughs) Our reservation is a peninsula. And on the East side is Heady Creek and half of Heady Creek. just in 2015, got shut down for Shellfish. And that's just because of runoff from all the houses, the golf course, things like that. For the most part what you see in all the Hamptons are assets. They don't actually really live there for the most part. In the summertime they come out here to vacation, but for the most part they're assets. If they were there year round there'd be a lot more pollution that is detrimental to our health here and economy on Shinnecock. So our biggest thing is that we have to continue to protect our front line. (door slams) - [Woman 2] Do you want a sandwich - Oh no. We're not doing good here, hunting and fishing to near extinction of everything. It happened so fast. There's barely any more scallops left. We had a tribal oyster hatchery for a while, but that closed down unfortunately. So there's no tribal Shellfish business, like they do on the outside. - Hi there. - We're just back to sustenance living, go out get some clams, some mussels scallops for our own supper. Fish to eat, for the week or so. - Another bucket. - Now we get to eat here. - Absolutely unequivocally see a correlation between the overdevelopment and especially our waterways. We are people on the shore. Our livelihood over the course of time has been derived from the waters. We as whalers, basically established the economy out here in selling whale oil for the street lamps, things like that. - We have to live here together and it's not getting any better, it's getting worse. The groundwater pollution, the contamination of the pesticides 'cause your lawn has to be spotless and bright green and unnatural and the chemicals, everything that's polluting this earth and we're drinking it and people are dying of cancer left and right. Can you just see, it's got to stop. - Right here will be the tennis court, in the back is the pool. And this house will sell for about 10 million but I'm confident it'll sell in the next 90 days. (drilling) Do you speak English? - A little yes. - I need that to shut off for five minutes. - Okay, okay. - While we do some, thanks. As you see it's like so wide open. This has changed with our clients who are now in their 30's and 40's, and they want more modern and very open. So people pay for that. And it's, there's no woods. People don't really love the woods. They want openness. But you'll drive up the street and you'll see four of my houses in a farm field. And that gets people crazy. So how do I defend myself against that? I didn't buy the farm and cut it up and sell it. The farmer did. - Bronze fennel, look's like a forage in there. These are all perennial herb, cardoon over there. Edible violas, nasturtiums. We do a lot of edible flowers. People discovered kale. Now we have got six or eight different types of kale. - Yeah, this is some real work in the farm, as you can tell. Once the landscape has changed, we've had to evolve and it's constant. Nettles. - 12.99 a pound. - [Woman 3] The family farm has been here since the 1600s and we are the 11th generation. - We were going up in a very sweet, provincial little town. And there was so much land, I mean, I... It's really amazing what's happened in a short amount of time with the water's being polluted and the over building. - Yeah, even in the past 10, 15 years a lot of acreage that we used to rent from family members now that's all gone and developed. - It's a lot easier to sell an acre of land for half a million dollars and at least, you know, struggling work, 50, 60 hours a week. (upbeat music) - Since 1640, there were all these different disputes about land, people challenging whether the land was there whether/ they had the right to graze there. The town of Southampton approached the tribe and said, "Okay this is how we're going to try to resolve this. "We will give to the tribe a lease for 1,000 years." (upbeat music) And that includes the lands for where we live now, Shinnecock Neck, the Shinnecock Hills. We were able to hold this lease and then the tribe would sublease to farmers and other people and still be able to use our own land. That's how we were able to get a lot of our basic needs met. - We were given a lease for 3000 plus acres that was whittled away until 1859. 1859 the robber barons, the railroad people wanted to build the railroad line from Manhattan out to Montauk. And in blatant disregard for the non intercourse act, which said that no state, no town, no village, no farmer could take land from an Indian or an Indian tribe without an act of Congress. Well, New York state, they had 20 signatures supposedly giving the land to the state. Well, 10 of those signatures were people that were dead. They had gone and gotten names off of headstones. The other 10 were not Shinnecock. This is what they put before the judge. They got the land and our people from that next day when we found out about it, proceeded to fight for it. But we, as Indian people were not considered citizens. So they would not allow us to take this into court. This land was stolen from us, a flat out, no questions hands down stolen. (upbeat music) Now what sits on the acreage is some of the most prestigious golf courses in the world. You have a national golf course. You have a brand new one, Sunbonnet Golf course. And you have Shinnecock Hills, which will be hosting U.S open. And you have a multitude of multimillion dollar homes that sit in what was once our sacred Shinnecock Hills. (upbeat music) - Property under video surveillance. This is the Shinnecock Hills golf course. This was, this is a sacred place to us and it was a long time ago and it's still is. We can come here, but still we're on the outside. We're not allowed in here, we're not allowed any access to our sacred sites. They use our name for whatever they want. Their logo is a native chief with a head dress on, it's the in your face kind of boldness. We know we have still to this day, ancestors buried in this golf course. Buried with respect and ceremony and love and honor. Shinnecock men were hired to help construct the golf course. Stories handed down to us say that they witnessed 100s and 100s of the ancestors bones being desecrated during this construction. And couldn't do anything about it. And to host the U.S Golf Open here, it's just a slap in the face. - [Caller] What are you guys doing? - We're making a documentary. - [Caller] Okay well, I got a call about a suspicious vehicle here so. - We're not trespassing you. This is none of your business right now. So bye-bye goodbye. No this is public property goodbye. And I'm a Shinnecock Indian, so leave us alone, goodbye. I don't care who you are either. We're on public property leave us alone. - You're not on public property. - Please, this is, are you kidding me? Shoot go right ahead, not even on the golf course. A man with vehicle showed by the road and this guy is harassing me. Well, that's how the Parrish Pond fight started. You know, we were on the shoulder of the road having our peaceful protest and the New York state police showed up with a chip on their shoulder. Someone told them that there was a bunch of Indians on the side of the road, protesting the desecration of the land. We were well within our rights where we were standing. This is the Parrish Pond Development, 62 acres of beautiful pristine land with some of the last of the Marine plant life. Heathland, they call it? (upbeat music) it's gone, it's now someone's lawn. (upbeat music) It's gone forever. (upbeat music) - We are protecting ourself and territory, where's that not one more acre sign. You read that, I hope everybody here can read 'cause that's what we're here for. Not one more acre. (upbeat music) - State police you're just calling and cursing at us. One in particular, after the bulldozers fired up their engines, he came from behind we were all his might and pushed me into the middle of the road. (upbeat music) We know the bones were dug up here and construction workers were instructed to put them in the dumpster. - When we ride through the Shinnecock Hills, and you see what we consider the destruction of our land. You hear about the Sioux and their faint black Hills our Shinnecock Hills here held the same meaning the same historic value that any of these other tribes around the country have held with their land. We've had several digs up in the Hills there that have traced our lineage in this area. Back over 10,000 years. (upbeat music) - Our ancestors would bury people on the hilltops. The villages that we would live on would be on the East side where the sun rises and then the burials would be all facing West. And so that's so the sunset can bring them into the spirit world. (somber instrumental music) (roaring waves) (rattles) (screeches) (footsteps) (roaring waves) - [Woman 4] Good morning, everybody. - [Audience] Good morning. - [Woman 4] You guys have a good Memorial Day weekend? Ruthie and I, we have a special guest here with us today. Our town supervisor Jay Schneiderman is here. (crowd clapping) - Thank you, it's an honor for me to serve as your supervisor. The town is in great shape. We continue to work really hard on protecting drinking water and surface waters and open space, keeping taxes low which I know is important. We have the U.S open coming and the big USGA golf tournament that is coming next week. It brings a lot of money to the economy. And that's a good thing. - My questions about taxes? - Sure. - Tax have really become a problem, are you concerned about that? - So I realized a lot of you pay property taxes and property values are going up in general. And I know most of you are on fixed incomes. - The high cost of land complicates a lot of things out here and it acts as a filter. So a lot of people who may be third, fourth, fifth generation kinda grew up out here. They see the cost of living go up, but their property values are going through the roof. Their taxes are going higher and higher. They end up selling those houses and then that house will become probably a second home. And somebody will have to service that second home to take care of the landscaping or fix the boiler or mow the lawn. That person probably isn't gonna be able to live in the community. So a lot more workers are commuting in from further and further away. And you see that in the mornings between say six o'clock and nine o'clock, the traffic eastbound is unbelievable. So we're creating a demand for labor that can live in this community. - [Repoter] Southampton town officials say the most horrifying violations they found at the Bel-Aire Cove Motel Town court officers this week issued 215 code violations against 28 Landlords. Officials say they found 17 people living in this four bedroom house. (upbeat music) - A lot of people are struggling, if a three bedroom house cost you I don't know, $3,000 a month, and you're only making, $15 an hour. and they're only letting you work 25 hours a week because they don't wanna give you insurance. We have people that don't have places to live that are sleeping out in the woods, or have making little shacks for themselves to live, because they're poor and the homeless. People hear that and they're like, "Oh, "you're in the Hamptons, what are you talking about?" "Are you kidding me?" "You're in the Hampton." - It's a kinda classic town gown in the Hamptons. The professional middle-class is so far from the elite and there is such an antagonism towards the elite. You could feel it on a visceral level. On the other hand, the whole economy is based on this elite. And so it's really hard not to kind of continue to market and cater to this elite at the same time that you resent them. I think the Hamptons represents a historical microcosm of the class struggle here in the United States and in many cases around the world because it begins when native Americans who had lived here on the land have that land taken away from them. And the only thing left is really for them to become the initial working class here in the Hamptons. - Did you have fun on the playground? Did you go to the playground or to the beach? (speaks gibberish) - Okay. - One child sleeps on that couch, two sleep on this couch, I sleep in that bed and when another grandson comes over, he sleeps like right here, he'll put the pillows down and sleep here. And then Nasha and her daughter sleep in one bedroom. And my mother sleeps in that bedroom. So we have to take care of each other. The housing situation doesn't get any better around here. And I mean, the oppression runs deep. - Every member of the Shinnecock Nation is a member of the town of Southampton. And so they're entitled to everything that any town resident would have. They certainly vote, they get permits to park on the beaches, they use all town facilities. There are tremendous things that members of the nation could take advantage of without paying any property taxes. But we do have high value properties that pay high taxes that provide services, youth services, transportation services, park services, roads. The Shinnecock Nation they benefit from all those things. The same things that I can take advantage of and you know, I pay property taxes. - We're obviously very strong fiscal position. We're improving our roads, we're fixing drainage problems, we're addressing infrastructure. we're improving our parks that everybody enjoys. What happens when you do that? People wanna live in a community like that. - What we've done is tremendous for the town. 400 homes we've built and the average tax bills gotta be $30,000 on my homes. It really helps keep up with the ever-growing budget. The town needs the development to keep going. They'll never say that, but what they do without it. (tense music) - The Hamptons as a place of paradise and respite was something that, Walt Whitman wrote about and inspired a whole generation of artists to leave New York to go out. It became a place that symbolized nature. It symbolized this authenticity. As the Bohemian pioneers do in all forms of gentrification, the artists brought out the very rich people who saw this place for its natural beauty, but also as a place that they could put their mark on it. Very wealthy people from New York city went out and built these huge summer cottages. And it became kind of the place for the rich and famous to go. On the one hand celebrating its naturalness, but also bringing in electric lights and bringing in the golf clubs and bringing in all the different trappings of their New York high society. (soft music) - Hi, welcome back to talk of the town. I'm your host, Jason Ottoman. And we are talking about the U.S. Open, 118th U.S. Open. You have been here for two years planning this event. - We've been in the community for a while, but now it's real. We certainly like having the guys here. We try at the town level to be as accommodating as we can, and we recognize over $100 million dollars in economic flow into the community. - [Reporter 2] Despite the bumper to bumper traffic and the hassle of getting to one of Golf's Premier Tournaments played right here at Shinnecock Hills Golf Course in Southampton, it's estimated about 30,000 spectators will attend the week called event helping business boom in the area, including here at Melrose pizza, where pies are flying out the door. - And they are certainly happy to get a piece of the U.S. opened pie. - You guys sat right at the table with us in that last meeting. And I feel personally that you misled us. So as far as I'm concerned you could have mentioned that then and said, well we really have no need for overflow parking. When Sage and Williams said to you, all the people coming from the East could be parked on the rez. You never mentioned that you had already established parking East. So, you can sit here and try to spin it because that's what you do as a media person. But we still have to answer to the people and the people right now didn't even want us to continue any negotiations. That was the sentiment in the meeting Wednesday. - Hey fill in those holes baby. - Yeah baby. - Don't even continue the negotiations. Like let's just go out there and protest. (sings in foreign language) (motor vehicle hooting) - Hi Becca. - [Rebecca] Hi, how are you? - We'll be here probably from at least like eight to five everyday. - Okay. - Yeah. He said, if we need anything, just let him know. - How? - Oh we need our land back. - They're sitting on one of the most valuable pieces of land in the country and they could generate income from that land. Like they could all be millionaires literally but they can't seem to get behind any one idea and stick with it for very long. I don't know what's the right economic development direction for the Shinnecock. It's really up to them, but they have opportunities to, I'm not... It town is standing in their way. - [Reporter 3] It's the multi-million dollar question? Where will the Shinnecock Indians want to build their casino? Now that they've cleared a big hurdle in gaining federal recognition as a tribe. - There was a tribe in Connecticut that owned one of the largest casinos in the country. They excel, they went by us like we were standing still. And in terms of creating economic development when we started the gaming, there was a lot of hope in our community. Soon as we did that, we became public enemy number one. - I haven been here 43 years. I have no desire to have that around here. - The Island's narrow. We have traffic problems as it is. - Certainly revenues from a casino can be quite high but the community does not wanna see a gambling facility out on the East End. - A lot of people had concerns about the traffic and the problems that are sometimes associated with gaming. - It's gonna cause traffic. And you've been out there on 27 lately to understand the traffic out there, we didn't create that you did. - [Man 2] We were going to start a small facility. We weren't going to go into the big billion dollar facilities or anything like that. - We went through that whole year and it was really a nightmare. The developer backed away. The whole thing just fell apart, literally it fell apart, while we were good neighbors, everything was okay. As long as you Indians stay up on the reservation and in your place, we're fine having you here. - I'm not really sure what else the town could do for members of the nation. But I think that they can improve their economic situation in a lot of ways and I'd love to work with the tribal council, moving an idea forward, as long as it's one that really supports the community. It's not gonna be a problem for the community. - The Hamptons itself has become a brand. It's become a commodity and one of the things that's buttress the image of the Hamptons as the land of the rich and famous is the marketing to the rich and famous that makes it even harder for people who are struggling, that makes it even harder, for the people who were in the backroom, doing the dishes or the people who are serving and being ignored or the people who are cleaning the streets or the people who are in places like the Shinnecock reservation where you essentially have whatever cultural capital having quote unquote, real Indians gives to a location. But without any knowledge of the history struggle in what those different locations actually mean. (upbeat music) - [Woman] We've seen more Porsches and Mercedes. (motor vehicle hooting) - [Woman 4] Thanks Bry. - Hi how are you doing? - All right, and you? - Good, what about you? - So I saw the signs and I wanted to see what was going on? So there are remains that are just. - Our ancestors are still buried here. - What do you think should be done for them to right the wrong? - Really give us our land back. - Yeah, you want the whole forest back? - It would be nice if we got all-- - That would be nice, I don't think that can actually happen. - They can start with the reconstruction of the graves so that they don't play golf on the graves of our ancestors. - And it needs acknowledgement to Shinnecock the people not Shinnecock the Golf Course. - No I know, I was really curious because I know there's millions of millions of dollars being made like how can you right, or how would you want the right to, the wrong to be-- - I just told you. - We are to give back the land. But you're right they probably won't. - Why is it fair to continue on committing this crime of stolen property? Just because you stole it 100 and so years ago, doesn't mean the crime goes away. You take our land, you desecrate our graves, you play golf, you make gazillions of dollars. What is justice fair about that? Nothing, you gonna start from square one. - Sorry. Yeah. I'm with you. - Okay thank you. - You should have the logo on your shirt. - Yeah that's the real logo, not that fake Shinnecock open logo. - My grandmother was one of the matriarchs of our community. She was born in 1889. I think one of the things that she instilled in us... I had two uncles. They caddy they used to caddy right over here at Shinnecock Hills. And everyday that we rode on that golf course she would say to us little, man, this is your land, this is our land and you have to get this back for us. It's gonna be your generation that does it. The land battle has been ongoing from 1978. We started this battle, this fight for recognition and land. In the last 15 years we finally had enough funding to really fight it in court. - So it was 2005 that we first officially filed our land claim. - They are claiming latches. And what latches is, latches says that, well you waited too long, you didn't fight for it. And we're like, are you kidding? - And the equitable doctrine of latches you can't disrupt the expectation of current land owners. And because the Court of Appeals just dismissed our claims we weren't able to delve into the facts of the case. So I put together a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme court for our land claim. It's kind of the last way to really exhaust your claim through the system. But the Supreme court decided not to review our claim. In that sense, it's still alive. If it was an unfavorable decision that would really have ended our claim, but they didn't. And because of that we still have ways that we can bring our claims. (upbeat music) - We have a thing, we have to preserve our way of life for the next seven generations. What that means is that we have to understand who we are. We have to understand our history. We have to be able to tell that to our children. There was a famous quote "To save the man you must kill the Indian." Meaning, not literally kill the person, but you have to kill the Indian spirit inside of them. You have to kill their way of life and turn them into a civilized person. It was actually illegal in the United States and Canada for native Americans to practice our cultures for us to hold ceremonies for us to wear our traditional regalia. They would say that we couldn't have been worshiping God because we weren't Christian. So we must've been worshiping the devil. We were forced to assimilate to the colonized world due to what I call institutionalized colonialism. A lot of our culture was lost. A lot of our history was lost. - There used to be a stockade downtown and our people used to be put in that stockade if we were caught speaking our language. - [Man 3] The Hamptons has its own sense of its own history. And who gets to tell that history? - There are two ways that people who kind of come to an area and conquer and settle an area, try to both imprint their own identity on it and then naturalize it in a way as if they've always been there. The first way is to establish the aesthetic of their lives. They build buildings that look like the buildings that they're used to. So you bring with you and you build what you know, but eventually you need to suggest that this always was. You start to look at the history and who gets to tell the history and where do you start your history? You start to look at how things are named. You start to create a kind of historical sense that this has always been your place, you are of this place. And so if we're really going to have an accurate picture of history, whose voices aren't being portrayed in this, and what do they add to the story? (bell rings) (birds chirping) - The Southampton town board has made massive efforts to protect their colonial sites and their colonial cemeteries or colonial old houses, but they don't make an effort to help us preserve our Native American sensitive sacred sites. They just, they don't see it as the same. - The acquisition of lands of Romeo in Shinnecock hills. - We have been before you many many times and you always have said the same thing. The goal is to preserve the 13 acres. - Good afternoon, I am Rebecca Geniah and this is Lasha my granddaughter from the Shinnecock Indian Nation. I believe the town Southampton needs a reminder that life did not begin in 1640 when the pilgrims arrived on our shores from Europe, Native people lived on this land in harmony with nature for 1000s and 1000s of years before your arrival. - Public hearing number five to consider the acquisition of lands of Parrish Pond. - The source of funding would be the community preservation fund. - Those lots were historically sensitive. And what they're planning to do with it, to preserve it, does anybody know. - Today we're talking about preservation, primarily land preservation and the community preservation fund. - When property transfers, the buyer pays 2% of the purchase price into a dedicated fund. - This 2% tax has been generating quite a bit of money. - In the town of Southampton alone. The fund has generated over $700 million yes. - Right well, $700 million - Previous to the 1990s, there was your small year round population here as well as your summer resort homeowners. I think in the 1990s wall street started to sort of get bigger. (upbeat music) The Hamptons became an attractive place to have equity. - With the pace of development, we're losing open spaces, Woodlands, which are important habitat. We're losing farmland which was part of our agricultural character. So we started to buy a lot of these properties that really kind of protected our rural character. - People who spend a lot of money on homes out here really love to drive past farmland. Community preservation fund was to preserve our community character which is defined in part with our scenic landscapes. - One of the things that accompanies this new wave out to the Hamptons is a kind of aesthetic that really creates a new sense of nature. If you look at some of the photography of the disappearing farms and there's this kind of romanticization of the farms at the same time that farms are becoming vistas and not working farms, they don't produce food. They produce views, photographers kind of create this whole nostalgia around the farms at the same time that they kind of naturalize their extinction. It really turns farms into this kind of caricature of something that's historical. And on the other hand, it's a distortion of the historical narrative itself because it suggests that the farms themselves are what's indigenous to the place. And of course, the farms only represent that wave of conqueror that clear cut the land and destroyed the Native American economy and brought in their own kind of commercial agricultural economy. - Shinnecocks do alert me to properties that they think are important. They will get involved particularly for a subdivision on a property that they feel is important to explore preservation. It has to do with timing and persistence, and also with the Shinnecock tribe members, educating landowners and helping them to understand why it's important. - We've been able to preserve. I think it's less than 20 acres of land fighting tooth and nail, telling them these are graves. We have to protect them this is sacred land. This is ancient burials. New York is one of four States in the whole country that don't have graves protection laws. (upbeat music) - [Reporter 4] Walter Richards of Shelter Island speaks with awe about the discovery he unearth on the grounds of his Osprey road home, a mass grave containing the remains of Native American Indians. Skeletal remains buried in fetal positions about four feet into the ground. - It's not too late and it's not over till it's over. There's not one foundation up there yet. - A horse barn was built over a massive grave site on private property, despite the good intentions and the goodwill of individuals in town people they went ahead and build it. They have known grave site ever known so on County land or public land, there are laws, there are rules and regulations in place to protect those sites. But if they're on private land then it's a different story. - Everybody watches, discovery channel. We thought this was something that, was going to be really neat and be able to uncover. We had a really good time uncovering it, looking at everything and studying it. It was really exciting. - We thought it would be in the best interest of the remains to be encased within the four walls of our structure and basically preserved forever which when you get into the whole which that's when things went awry, because we didn't know that their belief system was not similar to our belief system where we bury people in concrete vaults all the time. - Don't imagine how we feel. Imagine how you would feel if it were you. (upbeat music) - Shelter Island prompted us to start writing legislation. - When these issues are brought to our attention we address them like a fire drill. Seeing that the Shinnecock have proposed that there be a systematized approach to this namely a colonial and Native Americans graves' preservation. - This draft has been with the Southampton town board probably since 2003. Archeologists have helped over the past 13 years or so. Every time we go to the Southampton town board. Okay well, here's another draft. I have to run it by the attorney. We have, we're probably on our fourth town supervisor. - George. - [Man 4] I think the real experts on this they're sitting in front of you, the Shinnecocks. - [Judge] Of course. - What you said to us in the phone calls is that it's in the attorney's hands. What has your attorney come up with in four and a half years of reviewing this draft of graves protection? - There is a working draft but it's been through at least three different attorneys. - We've been to many supervisors many different board members, many different town attorneys and everybody has the same story. We're looking into it and we'll, pass it by the attorneys. - Some people that buy the property don't know the property. They only see the value. I don't blame them for that's all we showed them. Southampton town needs to say there's graves, if you find one, you're moving your house. - Okay, but I want to get you there legally. Okay and we've talked about this and I know it's all cumbersome and complicated, and I'm asking my town attorney to please pay attention so that you can move it through the town attorney's office. - It's only complicated because you've never done it before. It's not complicated, this is very simple. If you want it done, you do it. And anyone who buys property here, that is part of the gamble they take when they buy a piece of property in the town of Southampton and it can be done at your next meeting. - Well if it's that simple we'll try it. But I'm telling you, I don't think it's that simple. - Now on private property there's a law that you can't bury a person. I don't see how it's so hard to have a law that says you can't dig up a person. Somethings are as simple as that they really are. - We're not going to settle for this each and every single time a grave is unearth. - So within a month, we're gonna regroup. We're gonna give our town attorney some time. We will get back to you. And Becky is you're our main point person for heading up the task force. (upbeat music) - A number of you have come to approach the board of Native American graves, burial site protection. - We're on our fourth supervisor since 2003. And we have not really gotten much anywhere. - Just saying the owner's rights are over yours is that presently in you're looking line-- - Yes go over the rights of the desecration of the grave. - We have a committee for relationships between the Shinnecock Nation and the town. - No. - Probably is a good idea. Whether it would be twice a year or something like that. I don't know. - I don't know either but in order for us to accomplish certain things, we have to kinda keep it separate. - And I just want to make sure today you're speaking as a representative of the Shinnecock Nation or as an individual? - I am on the Shinnecock Archeological Advisory Committee the intergize, so I don't know what you're asking me. - I just wanna know if this is. - Plus I am general counsel. - Your position today is it an official position of the Shinnecock Nation or is it an individual position? - I am an official representative of the Shinnecock Archeological Advisory Committee. And I'm no stranger maybe to you or because I predate I don't really remember anybody's face. - So I just wanna make sure you're speaking on behalf of the nation. - And I have been since 2003 and it's in black and white, right in front of you, okay, thank you. - We think a simple procedure to protect these inadvertent discoveries. - You know what my fear is right? - I Know what it is. - That a developer, developers are good people you know but that if we make the process too onerous that they're not gonna tell us. They just simply then they never saw it. So we have to make sure. - 0kay but there are remedies for that. Like if you dig up wetlands, don't you have a remedy for that? - That's it that's what I'm trying to say. - Okay so if you dig up a place where there are certain fish that are protected a certain trees that are protective don't you have a remedy and it includes potential criminal prosecution. Or potential violation or withdrawal of your permit. There are penalties for all of this misbehavior. Now we don't, we want people to do the right thing. But when they don't, there's a consequence to this behavior. - It is said, the fear is that graves are being encountered when homes are being excavated. - Oh we know that we absolutely know that. - And no one's being notified. - No one's being notified. - Not even the NB. - Not even the NB. - So we have to enforce that somehow. When you look at the laws that are the books John, what are you finding here that then? - This is total news to me. So I wanna research this and find out what we have here is-- (coughs) - Isn't it just common sense if you dig up bones-- - How come you didn't know this before when you first came here? - The tribal counsel has change too. It shouldn't have happened. - This has nothing to do with the tribal council. This is absolutely nothing to do with tribal council. (drum beats) (upbeat tense music) - Paige can you hear, go hand me her a belt, please. Give me five, give me 10. There we go. - You coming back with more - A chief Little Fox we're in the same space. Okay, hi. (clinks) - My grandfather was one of the co-founders who began the Powwow. He had a vision that it was going to bring the people together. (drum beats) (sings in foreign language) - From Nassau County to Suffolk where a grim discovery happened in the Hamptons. Human remains found at a construction site in Shinnecock Hills, and the remains were taken to the office of the Suffolk County medical examiner. - He became very defensive when we saw officers going down there with shovels and sifters. That was very offensive. - They were treating it like a crime-- - They was treating it like a crime scene. - I didn't even want to pull it out because I'm afraid that I'm gonna damage something. - I don't wanna see it turn into a long thing that-- - It's an archeologically sensitive sites, it could need... We don't know you. - Construction is being halted in parts of Southampton this morning. The state's asking Southampton town to consult with members of the Shinnecock Indian Nation. - It's very hard to see what the profile is because it's all different because it's a whole... It's all been disturbed. So things are falling down on top of each other. I can't get a good look at what the soil even looks like. Charcoal down, they're falling out of the wall. - Yeah it looks like it's charcoal. - It could have something to do with the burial. - It looks like. - You could probably date, the due carbon 14 on the charcoal. Typically you find fresh water so. - It's right there. - Shannicock gave us fresh water until the hurricane. (singing) - [Reporter 5] Members of the Shinnecock tribe in Southampton are fighting to protect the graves of their ancestors. Rebecca Geniah tells me she believes the remains are likely three centuries old. - The Suffolk County homicide kept telling us we have to make sure it's not an MS-13 murder. So it was kind of like almost insulting from day one. - Constantine the homeowner, unearthing this grave, he did not take very lightly. And he comes from a country where there's war torn, mass burials, so he was very sensitive to this site. We asked the community preservation fund to possibly make the offer so we can put it back as much as a natural state as we possibly can. After all of this destruction. - Why is that? - You guys promised that you were gonna take care of this and now you're canceling the meeting. - He's in a bad position. Now, he's now he's having problems with his lender 'cause his lender saw this in the paper. So, now they could call the loan on him 'cause he hasn't started he stopped. - I don't know what to do at this point. - The day you were there you heard everything you needed to hear when they said what do you want us to buy every piece that had bones on it? I mean, you heard that's where we should've known in the beginning, where that was going. - Call Becky I need their blessings to start. - Hey, how are you? They canceled the meeting. They don't want to get in a battle right now 'cause they know the Powwow is going on. And what they're gonna do is they'll say there's not enough money or didn't praise high enough and they're gonna try to throw it as Constantine the bad builder, meanwhile, he's willing to sell for exactly what he has into it. I mean, it's probably half a million dollars. And they've spent billions almost in that fund. - [Caller 2] I can feel it flipping already. - I would just take excavator there tomorrow. And if it's nothing resolved then we'll stop. (upbeat music) - Their offer is what it is and there's still $185,000 that he's put into this project. Yes, that's amount he's short. We're trying to do this I need support from everybody to call him and say, look we are going to raise this money. We're gonna do this. Constantine wants to come back Tuesday and finish his project. The worst case scenario, let's say he's allowed to come back in here and he said, okay. - I can watch. The problem with monitoring is the backer gets to it before you can see it. - Yeah. - So even if you say stop, which they stopped things are already disturbed. (upbeat music) - You know, it is an emergency and at the last text I sent you, I said, "Why can't we purchase the land and put it in land, into trust." It's ours, we can own it and put it into trust. - My question is who was to control the hand? - Us. We won't drop the contract where we're stewards of the land. They don't want another thing to do. They proposed us in the past to us and not your board of trustees, but other boards or trustees, please read this, please read this, please read this. A year, two, three, come Tuesday, I gotta beg that guy to come here instead of going over there to start developing to come here so he can hear it from someone else besides me. - Okay yeah. We gonna find more money. - We're trying to get man all money. He needs all of his money back and he deserves to have all of his money back and that's should be no question. But it's always got to be the native people who stand up and begin something good. (tense music) - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, once again thank you all for coming to our lands here of Shinnecock. Ladies and gentlemen we have a situation going on right down the road from here there was a piece of land that the remains of one of our ancestors was found. The leadership of the Shinnecock Indian Nation feels very strongly, that this piece of land should be returned to the tribe we call upon you to stand with us. - I'll have relatives going around, passing out flyers with that information, to see how you can contribute. (crowd claps) - Members of our historic preservation and repatriations committee has been trying to get them to put legislation and policy in place for incidents just like this and what transpired. So they're aware of the long history of us going at it with them. And so for me, it's really about sticking to your word. (tense music) - We're here today to pray. So today we are gonna ask that the ancestors please help us. (speaks in foreign language) - Thank you, creator for this plan. Thank you for our ancestors. We pray today creator that you can be with all of us however, this goes. And I pray that our energy, our ancestors, feel strong and they feel honored and respected. I pray that any divisions that our tribes have, creator, and this town has, and government has I pray that we can understand, creator that this is unhealthy from all of us. (somber music) (upbeat tense music) - Suffolk County tax map, number 900 to 32 to lot 35. - If the town decides to buy this property today it's a very historic time, for our relationship between Shinnecock and Southampton We are concerned about our house on a private street that we do not lose the value of our home. - We are doing our best, that's very difficult sometimes when you're emotions are struck. We hope that we all can uphold our word. - Thank you for meeting with us when our tribal leadership has called for meetings, this is not going to be the last time if this happens. So I really hope that there are policies and protocols put in place for the next time. - Anyone else on the motion? Call the vote all in favor. - [Council] Aye. - Any opposed opposition? It is approved. (crowd claps) (upbeat music) - So clearly you win?. - More to come, more to come. - We will acquire this property. It will be protected and it's not gonna stop here. So I felt a sense of like we had almost turned a corner that this was part of the healing process. - No more accidental unearthing there's no such thing. - I'd do a jig, but my legs hurt. (laughs) - Our goal is to purchase every single vacant lot in the Hills and protect for all time. (mumbles) When people realize you take care of your ancestors you take care of the earth, good things will happen. That's what I believe with my heart and soul. - Looking at the history of the Shinnecock struggle. It's their struggle that gives us a sense of what the future might look like. That it's their continued desire for dignity for recognition and for not even a return of the land, to their ownership, but a return of the land to the spirit of their history of collective ownership of collaboration, of human survival and subsistence in a sustainable way with nature. That really is the vision for what a future world might look like. (soft music) - My name is Rebecca Geniah. I'm calling from the Shinnecock reservation the grace protection group here. We would like to have a work session meeting, get on the agenda so we can talk about the graves protection laws. We haven't accomplished that mission yet. (upbeat slow music)
