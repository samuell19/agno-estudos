Yesterday we said, ``lf leave your phone on...`` ``...you translate!`` -l can`t. -Just try. ``Do you love me? lf not, l`ll jump in the river!`` All l find funny is how mobiles have rendered you unable to express love You wouldn`t even know how to write a proper love letter.

Come on, Auntie! -You kiss like God. -Yeah! -Who are you texting? -Everyone. Merry Christmas. Adam taught me to send group texts. For Christ`s sake! Most people shut their mobiles off at night. Pardon me. You`re with me even when you`re not. Join me? You hold me in your arms, love. You kiss like... Like... Shit! -You jerk! Know what happened? -Shouldn`t text boys at midnight. None of your business! We`re divorced. Oh fuck! You`re with me even when you`re not. You hold me in your arms. You`re with me even when you`re not. You hold me in your arms. Love! -Love! -Love?

Helenka, show us what it`s like. l`d like to use it in my teaching. Merry Christmas, friends! l`ll send another by New Year`s Eve. Small, ugly, and hairy. That`s me! The Chnistmas party was lousy, but Chnistmas Eve is going to be lovely. -Does Adam know the password? -When the lights go out. As always. Here`s the bell so you don`t have to look for it later! He didn`t try when you were married. His young squeeze didn`t invite him. -Wouldn`t you rather use a ladder? -Hush. Turn off the lights. -Lights out! -He`s out of his mind. l said Adam`d wait for darkness. -Hi! -Hurry! The kids are impatient. Bastik mustn`t call Alzbeta ``Gran`` or the evening`ll be ruined. Why would he call her gran when she`s his great-grandma? -Hi, Mom! -Hi, Helena! -Happy Christmas! Don`t forget. Adam will wait until the lights go out. -l`m not an idiot. -The place is like a Christmas tree! Baby Jesus! -Don`t they ever act normal? -Hurry! You believed in him, too. Until l was seven. But l had my suspicions for two years. -Baby Jesus! Baby Jesus! -Stay here! -lt won`t go back on. Relax! Gifts`ll be under the tree. Dad said l`m not getting a racetrack because l said a bad word. Ass! Wait! Baby Jesus! Stop staring! l`m having a heart attack. -Yum yum time, okay? -Do you kids know Baby Jesus` story? Jesus was born on hay. Three Wise Men went to see him. One of them was King Charles lV. Excellent! -But it wasn`t Charles lV. -Was so! l know it was! Leave him be. Of course it was. Smart boy! -lt doesn`t matter. -Yes it does! lt was Charles lV because he built the bridge! Ok, but... Don`t give in, Sebastian. l love it! Go on! -Your dad has no imagination. -That`s grandpa. Full of lessons! ``Thinking of you...`` My God! What a godsend! ``Could this be love?`` 101 fon 130. 6:57 pm. -This is 130. -A 53 year-old male, unconscious... Bet he got slippers for the tenth Christmas in a row. Cut the chatter! Climb in! Wow! lsn`t this amazing? Silent night. Holy night. All is calm. All is bright. Holy infant so tenden and mild. Holy infant so tenden and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace... -What`s wrong? -Nothing. l`d fall apart if l were alone at home with the children tonight. -Thanks for inviting us. -Now, now. -How`s the new novel going? -lt`s in the trash, Alzbeta. -l need fresh ideas. -Pida farted into your pillow! That`s okay, Gram! We can vacuum it. -May l call you Gran Banan tonight? -Not even to be funny. This is love. What a very merry Christmas! -Alzbeta! Are you okay? -Just let me kneel down. Yeah, yeah. When faced with etennity l suspect thene is no next life... What doesn`t exist now neven will. Come here, Bastik! Hurry! Hello. Excuse me? Now? No, l`m not surprised. Of course. l`m on my way. So? Are we going? -You were joking, right? -Don`t you have vacation now? -How about you? -My wife and l took a marital vacation. -lsn`t it a great idea? -lt`s wild. New Year`s Eve in Paris. What about after your vacation? After 15 years of marriage the vacation is permanent. My parents took a break, too. Mom went to Prague. Left me with dad in Bratislava. l stayed there seven years. Our marriage is working. My wife is incredibly tolerant. Plus we have a deal that we can both do what we want. There`s no other option. -God worked! Viki`s going to the movies with me. -Hi! -l saw a fortune-teller. -Here`s your blood pressure meds. -Know what she said? -They didn`t have your mineral water. That l`d finally find true love. Don`t be silly. That doesn`t mean anything. You can`t fall for everything. You`re not a little girl anymore. Kids! Stop that! Did you do your homework? -Kristyna! -Hi! -Will you look after mom New Year`s? -So it worked? -Yup. -Careful! You`ll spill it. -Can l have some, too? Girls? l want to tell you something. l`d like you to meet Arnost. To see if my family approves. We`ve been in the same English class for 6 months. Geepers, Mom! Life`s not over yet. Nope, not mine! Why the funny look, Kristyno? At your age you`re free again. Who would want a widow with 3 kids? A guy who`s suicidal or an idiot. Would you tell me who Ema is? -Do you know her? -l don`t know any Ema. -So you won`t tell me who she is. -l can`t if l don`t know her. You wish her Merry Christmas. You two must be close. l owe you no explanation. l can wish anyone l want a Merry Christmas. Don`t make a fool of me. Who is she? Why not take Bastik shopping instead of interrogating me? Calm down, Bela. lt`ll be fine. -lt`s a misunderstanding. -My foot! l have proof. l found some emails. -l`ll read them to you. -Do not read me any emails! -Especially not over the phone! -He sent me to buy dinner. So he can delete the emails. Except he`s out of luck. l printed out every one of them! Cheating on Bela shows you`re disgusting. Leaving emails in plain sight shows you`re a complete idiot. -lf anything happens between you... -lt`s even worse. Bela is threatening to go see her in Plzen. You can`t let that happen! Take walking shoes fon the Eiffel. l`m so excited. -Are you packing for a trip? -l`m giving Mrs Houfova old clothes. Mrs Houfova from the cottage who takes our grass for her goat? ls my own son keeping tabs on me? -What if Bela goes to Plzen? -Why Plzen? -``l`m busy...`` -You don`t listen. Ema lives there. Bela won`t find her without her address. -Plzen has a population of 200,000. -You act like l get in a bind weekly. You shouldn`t have taken maternity leave. ``l`m busy.`` ``Plzen has a population of 200,000.`` -``On maternity leave``? -Hang on five minutes! l can`t. l`ll fly over the river. l have to give you your ticket and... ... a kiss. l can`t make it today. Meet at the airport in the morning. You`ve reached Frantisek and Bohunka. Please leave a message. Hey, Frantisek! Where ane you? Hi Bohunka! Don`t worry. l`m coping. lroning... No, l was working. Don`t worry. l`m not smoking. l know. lt`s bad for my health. Nativity scene? Only missing a goat. Hi to Jasper and Sheila. Have fun. Do you come back the third or... The fourth. Good! Okay. Miss you, too. Bye! Kisses... Be right down! -Mom? -Do you know a good urologist? Arnost needs to be seen. He has the urge to go a lot. Sorry. Peeing has to wait until after New Year`s. Bye. Hi, Mom. -Could you take the boys along? -l`m not going to the cottage. -Why not? What am l going to do? -l don`t know. Go to the zoo. Go see dad at the cottage. l don`t care. -ls dad at our cottage again? -Excuse me, but it`s mostly his. -Calm down! lt`ll all work out. -Wrong. Bela didn`t come home last night. -Hey! What a surprise! -Oh, hi! -Bohunka! -My cuddlebug came to pick me up! -Are the girls okay? -Sheila and Jasper adore them. But those suppers. A nightmare. Bradly`s fingers in his food. Jerry`s in his nose. Both deserve a good... But that house! Magnificent! Draftier than a barn, though. -What`s wrong? -l don`t have my car here. But, sunshine, my car`s in the lot. -Bet you`re ashamed of your clunker. -Clunker? lt has new tires. -You okay? Do you have a cold? -No, l just can`t get over this. My month alone was like an eternity. l taught them some Czech words. Like ``backhoe`` and Baby Jesus. Their pronunciation is a riot! l can`t go. Sorry, love. Big kiss. Last call fon passengers to Panis. Come on! l missed you. Those Brits are like boring Eskimos. You`ll like Arnost. He`s a lawyer. -The guy you study English with? -No. l made up that part up. l didn`t want the girls to tease me. l love big families. What`s with Helena? She`s in a daze. Gran banan, no clue. For God`s sake! Can`t you get that fixed before someone breaks their neck? -lt can`t be fixed. You know that. -Never say something can`t be done. There`s always some jerk who doesn`t know it`s impossible. -And comes along and fixes it. -Look who`s talking. -Want some? For good luck. -Yours are the worst jokes ever. Thank God the holidays ane over. l was angry with him, then myself. Adam was in trouble. Yet selfish me could think of nothing but Panis. lt was oven between me and Fnantisek. Completely. Na obnatu. That`s the street name. Turn left after the factory. Conrection. Not left. Right. No. Turn around. Not up the hill. Down a steep hill near the factory. lf l could find a factory. -The police can`t find it either. -That really cheered me up. Sorry, it`s a factory smokestack. Why didn`t Frantisek get time off over Christmas? What? Who`s bloated? -He`s already dead? -But he`s put in the most overtime. The fishermen are eitherfreaked out or high. Give him mouth-to-mouth. Yum. Sucking face with a drowning victim. You`re wasting your talents with the ambulance. The smokestack was tonn down. Hey! Are you nuts? To heck with the smokestack. What is the problem? A heart attack? Loss of consciousness? A corpse? Situation remains unclear. A 48 year-old male cast his line and caught a drowning victim. He went into shock and blacked out. The police pulled the body out. lt was already bloated. Makes sense. This is 130. 48 year-old male has regained consciousness. Suspected heart attack. Over. -What about the body? -Should we record it as a catch? Your girls work for rich folks, huh? -Wow! ls this for me? -Yup. l`d pay for school, but au pairs attend the school of hard knocks. You were smart to quit your job here. Yesterday was a nightmare. Three car wrecks and a child with heat stroke. -Are you going to wait? -Yup! -Frantisek won`t be back for two hours. -No problem. By the time he finishes gnawing on the body, l`ll have my taxes done. l don`t want muffin to take the bus. -You knew he was married. -He said they had an open marriage. Come on. That`s guy bullshit. -What`s she like? -l don`t know. l was in shock. l couldn`t see her face. -Let`s have a drink. The hell with Paris! -Damn straight! l haven`t heard from him since. Given time the pain will end lt has alneady begun to fade Two madmen out on the sea Yet our oan cannot be found The boat bneaks on the sea You know it when you dnown Given time the pain will end -Given time the pain will end... -Piss off. Don`t blow out a burning flame... Grandma, you skipped a page. And this is Santa Claus. -You don`t even know what Claus looks like. -Do so! He`s the president of Prague. What`s this noise? Break`s long over. -May l help you? -Time for Chemistry class. Forgive me. Sorry. -Are you taking your bear? -The tebby dare? -Teddy bear? You`re a real silly willy. -A kiss for sweet dreams. -You`re such a sweet dad. You might adore him, but try not to get too used to him. -He might leave us. -Quiet! -l was just teasing. -But Adam promised... -Sure! Got down on his knees... Don`t forget his nose drops. l saw dad with his old squeeze... Old? She`s thirty. -Shouldn`t l tell mom? -Why? They`re divorced. lt ticks me off how Dad hides his relationships from her. Don`t be late! l don`t care who your dad sees. -See? -l can`t wait until his flat is approved and he moves. Good evening! Welcome to ``Let`s All Meet in Bed.`` Today`s guest will give us advice on how to choose a partner. -You don`t say. -Of course. We all make the same mistakes. Youn mother constantly hassled you. You choose girls who hassle you. l can`t help liking one type. That`s the mistake! Fine. So l see thnee pnetty women in one place, and l want them all. Then l walk up to an ugly duckling and take herstnaight to city hall. Exactly! So you say to settle forsecond best. lt`s betten to forgo the beauty queen and be happy. There`s no guarantee a hag won`t hassle you about coming home late. -The probability is much lower. -l don`t have that problem. l come home and my wife says, ``Thank you for coming.`` Asshole! l marinated a pheasant, added up the salaries... But l didn`t have time to bring you the nails. Sorry. My dad`s making hen housing. Sometimes l ask myself how we`ve accomplished all this. Why didn`t you sleep in the bedroom? -Why`d you sleep here, Bumblebee? -l wake up when there`s a full moon. And you grind your teeth. -We can move the bedroom. -No changes, please. Tomorrow l deliver dad his wire. l`ll stop for a ball gown on the way. Should l go to the tanning salon? Let`s write to the girls about our trip to London. -For a ball? -Bingo! l`ve been talking about the fishing ball all week. You didn`t notice. Wait! Where are you going? Sheila? Jasper, too? Sweet. They`re taking you to the Canary lslands. l see. Not until Easter. Did you tell dad when l was landing? No? Good. That was our agreement. Of course... ``Empty`` Hello? Who is this? -They dumped the stone on arid land! -You should`ve had a sign up. l`d like the name and address for telephone number 7399... Not for me. This is a detective agency. You`re going to pay us overtime! Not even Snow White and the Seven Dwarves give a shit! You ok? Never been better. -What are you thinking about? -A movie. -Which one? -Divorce... ltalian Style. ltalian Style? Haven`t seen it. This is the phone booth where we started our business. Remember? -l remember everything. -Come. l want to show you something. -What? -Come on! lt`s a surprise. l bought it new. lt was marked down. -A backhoe? -Yup! -Where`s the old one? Bingo! We never had a backhoe at home. You never noticed. Kanel kept putting off the divorce settlement. l didn`t cane. Frantisek didn`t call orwrite. He was lost without a tnace. l was losing hope we`d eversee each otheragain. -Hope l`m not late. -l was here early. This makes your divorce final. Your husband is the most generous person l know. l had to force the cottage on him. Almost as if he thought you`d get back together anyway. -What about the keys? -l don`t know. Excuse me. Mineral water and a menu... -Hi! -Hi! l`m here with someone. Come here. You can meet my lawyer. -So sorry! -No need to worry. This time oun relationship was even more wonderful than before. What happened to you? lt`s amazing. l wake up excited about the whole day. Was it our property settlement? Hello? Who might this be? Good news. Viktor`s leaving again. He gave me the keys to his studio. Some worries you have. At high noon. l`ll take it. -What? -l feel like making new discovenies. l`m as excited as a big kid. They get more excited than little ones. l think of you. Not all day. Though l am bnimming with joy and energy all day long. -What did l miss? -Not a thing. The new patient doesn`t want the uterine operation. -She did last time. -You`re confused. That was a different patient in the episode before last. -Hey fart! -Be nice! -What`s that? -A branch. That was the one with two uteruses. She wanted the operation. Get down! l said no climbing. Auntie let us climb! Some babysitter you are. l keep getting hang up calls. The caller just listens. lt happened once during winter Now it`s happening again. Arnost told me the technical term for that. -For what, Gran banan? -For having two uteruses. A double barrel. What`s a double barrel? Know what gives this family spice? Variety. Every day there is someone else who pisses me off. That was wild! Like on safari. The African tiger! -You speak French? -You remind me of this beautiful French medic... ...l met in the morgue. Grampa owned a vineyard in Provence. No, she had French background. l mean progenitors. Some open marriage. You just have to be home for dinner at seven. -lt`s the girls` birthday. -How so? Aren`t they in London? Yes, but Bohunka wants to celebrate. She`ll be upset if l`m late. Anyway. -l`ll shut up now. -You`d better. You`re two people in one. One is wonderful. The other l would kill. What time is it? When were you supposed to be home? The turkey`s dried out. The potatoes are fit for the hens. You`re making fun of me! Dad said l`m not getting a racetrack from God... ...because l said a bad word. Ass. What`s up? No word from Romeo? lt`s going to be one long Saturday. -You promised to move out by the end of the month. -l break promises. Because l always come up with better ones. For Christ`s sake! That`s a hunchbacked dwarf! -What are you hiding? Show me! -Please don`t do this to me! This is entirely unacceptable. Things could get ugly. Today l`m working overtime. Would tomorrow work? Yet another text from him? When we were married jealousy was below you. lt still is, but it bothers me while you`re reading my novel... For God`s sake! This is nonsense! You put our Christmas Eve in the first chapter! Charles lV in the hay, and our Gran Banan. Practically writes itself. You make me out to be an even bigger fool than l am. l can`t wait to see you and you say, ``That would work``? What would work? Lovemaking? French lessons? l`m glad l`m bedridden. l`m coming down with something. Bumblebee! Here`s your tea. Honey-nut. lt`s good for what ails you. lt worked! l am the winner! l see that. Sure it`s not sunstroke? ``Good morning, love. When can we get together and cuddle?`` ``How come you`re in the mood again?`` -Did you get a window seat? -Hurry so l don`t catch your cold. Remember. Give this to the girls. Give them each a kiss! A big one. -Get going! -Yeah! Yeah! Hello! Get going! l don`t want to jinx it, but l bet it`ll work this time. We`ll make up for New Year`s. -Your wife going away again? -Could be. What... what`s wrong? -What happened? -Nothing. Just trying to read... l have the Easter holidays off. Where do l book a flight to? No flying. Once was enough. As usual Frantisek had a wonderful surprise. A suite at the Hotel Pupp, oysters, and a champagne bath. Dinner by candlelight and a night of passion were guananteed. -Your jokes kill me. -l know mouth-to-mouth. -Oh? Hang on! Be right back! Cripes! What`s wrong? l love you! l love you! l`m okay. lt won`t be ready tonight. l feel like l`m 18. We have nowhere to stay. Well l feel like l`m 20, so let me take care of that. Extras, stay where you are! Come on, Andulka. l`m repainting. At the cottage you could write in peace. Paint? Be straight with me. You want the flat to yourself. l am being straight. You can even have the cottage over Easter. See? -Tomorrow l`m painting. Understand? -Yup. Know what, Karel. You could help me out for once. l don`t have to do everything alone. Rest assured. l`ll go. l`ll enjoy the cottage. Goodnight. Sweet dreams. Looking forwand to tomornow. l`m having sinful thoughts again. l was so excited. But you shouldn`t jump the gun. You never know what tomornow might bring. ls it a broken heart, or is he on dnugs? What`s the difference? This way. Please hurry! -And the name is? -Mrs Tabby. -l meant the lunatic! -Evzen. Make them leave, or l`ll jump! l`m right here, Evzen. Calm down! l want to be alone! Make them leave! What`s he doing on the ledge? Put on your helmets! There`s going to falling bodies. He barricaded himself in. We all get desperate. -l wanted to end it all, too. -You? You have no clue about erotic fascination. Hurry! He`s having a breakdown! Time is running out! He barnicaded himself in. Copy? -Here! -For cripe`s... -This is the spot! They say he has a bomb! Not his mom! A bomb! She`s through with me! l can`t take it anymore. She was an older than him. -There are tons of women out there. -l don`t want anyone else. A real hussy. Right, Mrs Tabby? Go to hell with Mrs Tabby! l`m okay. Mom stayed out all night. l nearly called the police. This morning she told me she wasn`t 16. He did this on purpose. He even took apart my bed. ldiot. Mom? -Are you painting? -No, l`m going to the spa. l don`t want to hear any bad news. l thought you and Karel were spending Easter at the cottage. -That you could babysit. -Remember we`re divorced? l`m painting. l don`t have time to babysit. Darn it! -ls Frantisek on a run? -No. We had a jumper. He collapsed. Just a... Hi! l thought you went to London. Don`t remind me. l spent the night at Heathrow. -But Frantisek... -Sheila took my girls to the Canaries. Then lvos said l needed new drivers. l hope to leave tomorrow. The doctor should be home by now. Poor guy`s all banged up. -Bye! -Bye! Emergency Services. A woman in trouble called from 739.... She`s not answering. Get me her name and address. Helena Altmanova. Check on her. Thanks. -You okay? -Fine. Kiss, but don`t touch. A new erotic game? -What`s wrong? -l jumped without a parachute. l`m having an aviation day. -l`m sorry. -lt`s okay. Franta! Frantisek! Bumblebee! The party you dialled is unavailable. Please try later. Certainly. Hi, Eda! l see. Right. Fine. Okay. Thanks. l owe you one. Bye. We didn`t sleep a wink. Fnantisek kept gnoaning. His ribs wene bruised. As a teen l felt bad for my parents because at 50 their lives were over. Maybe they were having a good time. With you it`s wicked! People who are suicidal call that erotic fascination. What would you like for breakfast? You. Well-done or medium? Emergency services used to be a nightmare. Heart attack in the attic. Only telephone on the ground floor. lmagine giving instructions to people on three floors... Bohunka was a master at that. She has an amazing sense of what to do. And when. She quit work to start a car rental firm. Today she owns three trucks. -Does she do jet plane tours? -No, but she has cleaning crews. Here you go. -What`s wrong? -Nothing. No one`s made me breakfast in twenty-five years. After you, ma`am! Helena! Fancy meeting you here! Don`t recognize me, do you? -We went to school together. -l don`t remember. Are you married? -ln a rush? l`ll give you a lift. -No, thanks. We have to get together. How`s coffee on Friday sound? -We can chat. -Thanks, l`m busy. We`re go to see the planes today. Bye! Big kiss! -Your husband? -Grandson. You`re a grandmother? How sweet! You must have me confused with someone else. No, l don`t. Braids? Bows? Helena Maskova. Right? -l`m drawing a blank. -We have to stay in touch. Stop by Sunday with your husband. We`re spending Easter at our cottage in the mountains. Does you kiss goodbye every morning? l just thought l recognized him. Can you find out something else? l can`t wait to see you, either. We`re going back to the station. l`ll be at your place at 7:30 pm. -l`ve had an odd feeling all day. -l have the perfect medicine. As long as the bouncy bed is inflated. Another patient complained about your crazy driving. Hope l didn`t dislodge his kidney stones. Milk! -Come in! -Hi, cupcake! Know where we`re spending Easter? The mountains. How did you get here? Not on a broomstick. Bumblebee. Sorry. Emergency. Big kiss. -l understand your business problems. -Wrench! But your desire to visit complete strangers... Everyone is a stranger at first, bumblebee. Until you get to know them. Fine. Switch shifts. Just put a light on in the ditch. You`re doing your best. We all are. You run into an old classmate. You ruin your Easter with the girls. What do you mean, why? So some ass doesn`t fall in a ditch. lf the plane ticket`s a problem l can break my piggy bank. Save your money for harder times. Hi! Okay. l`m not taking notes. l`ll remember. Thanks, Eda. They`re nice. You`ll like them! Adam and Bela went skiing in the Alps to make up in style. They left the children with me. Luckily Kanel met us there. -Any word from Frantisek? -He`s working over Easter. He`s playing dead again. That whack job won`t let up, though. ``l`ll be nearby on Saturday. Can l stop by?`` Either you went to school together, or it`s an excuse to meet Karel. Could be. Something keeps eating at me. What did she say? Quit the horseplay. Go change up! Does he always kiss you goodbye? l know your husband, too. The whole world knows Karel. Do you want coffee now, or will you wait for dessert? But l kissed Frantisek this morning. -That`s it! What if it was... -No way. She`s gone. -Oh Christ! -Helena! Swallow your pride. Tell Frantisek not to let her set foot outside. Remember that doctor`s name? The one from the ambulance? -The one who nearly strangled Maxik? -Just won`t let up... He could have a wife. l mean he`s definitely married. l could`ve gone to school with her. -No kidding! What wrong with that? -She might stop by. lf she does, don`t leave us alone. She might not even come. Then what`s the problem? lt didn`t work. What if his phone`s off? lf she is his wife she`s just trying to freak you out. -Don`t worry. No way is she coming. -To gorgeous to eat. lt`d be gone by morning anyway. Thanks for coming. lmagine if l were stuck here alone with my husband and his wife! And she`d scarf up our cake, too. l wouldn`t survive that. l was all wornied for nothing. Hi, everyone! This is Arnost. l`m a little blind. Alzbeta is a little deaf. You got it a little backwards. l`m a little blind and you`re a little deaf. Which one of you drove? We should`ve gone cycling. Or to play tennis. ``l`m across the creek.`` lf you don`t like my girlfriend, go fishing with her husband. Nonsense. Trout season isn`t until May. ls your cottage to the left or the right? -Damn it! -Too heavy? l brought sheets. What do you think, girls? What`s all the racket? Kids! Downstairs! -She`s crossed the creek. -Now that l see him outdoors he strikes me as a little worn out. What? Unfortunately, l soon leanned he was also a handyman. Who might we have here? Hi, Helenka! You could use a decent driveway. -Hi! -Hi! Where can we put our things? No fussing now. We don`t need our own room. We`ll take the couch. Right, Bumblebee? Say something! Nice hills. Around and around... -Haven`t you two met? -Yes, we have. This is the doctor who delivered Maxik. Maxik. And who might we have here? You must like airplanes. Look, this is Helena`s grandson. -Helenka? -Yeah. -Doesn`t he take English classes? -He hasn`t even started school yet. Smoke comes out of this stove. l meant the stove`s fine. Sometimes the chimney explodes. Use your brains. Outside with that ball! My girls started English at age 3. l would drive them 35 km. -Right, Pops? -Calm down, Bohuna. May l? Come here! Hi! My husband requires constant entertainment or he gets bored. Watch your step, here. Try not to trip. Damn it! lsn`t there anyone who can fix that? Do l have to tell you more than once? We`re guests here. Outside! Start your engines... Doesn`t anyone listen? -Over here! -Dido! You little rascals! No cake! You`re getting a spanking! Happy Easter! Helena, how about introducing us! Your little legs okay? l`ll help you. Come on. -Excuse me, sir... -This is the doctor who nearly... Karel! Slightly... Kind of... Strangled our Maxik. Now l am really sweet! -lt can`t be done. -That`s what they said. Leave it to me! Oh shit! How could you be classmates? She`s younger than you. We were not classmates. l`m not a hundred percent certain. How much younger is she? -At least five years. -You`ve got to be joking. -Nope. l`m starting to get it. Her business is doing just fine. Right? -Watch that freezing water! -Who`s she? Our new Aunt Bogunka. You`ll catch cold! Da, da. Yesterday l arrived from London. You even brought your own sheets? -More rags! -Wipe it up! -l will. A rag! Hurry! Rag! So now l can tell you why l`m here. -Have a seat. -Thank you. l brought you my attempt at writing. l don`t know if it`s publishable. lt isn`t really an attempt. These are my diary entries starting from our first kiss. Helena, this is 15 years of marriage. Sometimes we read it like a bedtime story. Love requires constant strength training. And train we do. -Franta likes it in the morning. -This isn`t... -l don`t read manuscripts. -There even are pictures. Frantisek is really playful. Niagra is his favorite. lt isn`t easy with men. Sometimes l feel like his bodyguard. Like l really believe you. We playing word association every night. lt`s ourfavorite game. The one who lasts longest wins. Whatever. -What`s this flood? -That should`ve been fixed long ago. -Arnost just... -Didn`t he know about the pipes under there? -How could he? He isn`t a plumber. -Right. He`s a lawyer. Oh God. So much for a happy Easter. Don`t panic. -Where`s the water shut-off? -l don`t know... -Go to the forest. -What do l discuss with a stranger? l meant with Bastik. Look what he`s doing! Who says life isn`t a barrel of monkeys? l was at my wit`s end. l loved being with Fnantisek. When he wished me good morning orsent a kiss goodnight. Now he`s simply a jenk about to get a good scolding fnom my ex. The shrew. Pretending to be my friend was bad enough. Now she wants to show me how Frantisek revolting is. Are you surprised? She`s his wife. l could never be a doctor. l faint at the sight of blood. At 20 you vomit a few times, then it becomes old hat. Morgues, blood, marriage. Tell me about the morgue. l might use it in my novel. Could two people meet in a morgue? l knew a guy who fell in love there. -l`ll be. -You could call it a fated love. -l can`t see! -So open your eyes! Did it last? No. -Ouch! l can`t get it off! -Bastik! -Bastik! Talk to me! -No! You`ll run out of air! -What an idiot! -Don`t cry! Your head will swell up! -What? -His head will swell up! -Bullshit! lt`s stuck to his hair. Yup. His head is swollen. He nearly strangles Maxik. Now this nonsense! l`d have brought my wrench if l`d known you put cans on your heads. Some obstetrician! Can`t even get a can off a child`s head! Helena! What`s going on there? What`d you say? Bastik! What have you idiots done to him? lnstrument. Easten was finally over. My head was throbbing and l had a stomach ache. ``Sans`` plus infinitive replaces a dependent clause. When can we shorten a sentence this way? Your excuse had better not be that the tram had a flat. Sorry. He`s a henpecked wimp! Hope l neversee him again. l won`t answen his text messages. lt wasn`t fnom him anyway. Did you used to tell your lovers we had an open marriage, too? That you were free to do what you want? Silly! l still claim l`m married. You`re pathetic. You wanted the divorce. Not me. Then it became convenient. l was single despite being married. Let`s go out on a date! Dinnerfor two. Roses. -Dance classes for the aged? -Stop it! God! ls he texting you again? Don`t kid yourself. The guy`s a classic chicken. Your son wants my help with his love triangle. Even though he inherited your genes. Look! Why do you save old texts? ln a rush, love! l`ll call later. Give...! -Kisses... -Gimme that! Give me that! Five kisses... wherever you want. l have a few ideas. You moron! l`ll kill you. Yeah! Spning was in full bloom. Buds tunned into flowers. Larvae turned into butterflies. l was the only one who tunned into a complete idiot. What l would give to run into him. Welcome once again to ``Let`s All Meet in Bed.`` Today`s guest will give us advice on how to hold onto a partner. -Madame Edita, witch and psychic. -That`s what my tnade license reads. You have a guananteed recipe fon how a woman can hold onto a man. Every witch must be, above all else, a good cook. -For example, meatball sunpnise. -This necipe calls fon minced meat. -Oh my. -Beef. -l feel better now. You need armpit hain, fingernails, and a few dnops of blood. And if you can`t get any blood? Spit in it. We must accept a man fon who he is. He`s only good forthnee things: Hunting, fighting. And insemination. Listen close, ladies. A chanming and magical woman is the best any man could want. lf she doesn`t poison his food. l thought this was a negative field. But on TV they recommended change. How do you like it? lntimo! Okay, then. -l`m going to the pub for beer. -Don`t be long, Bumblebee! Tonight l won`t be back until tomorrow. Matej could take the attic room. Then we`d have the whole downstairs to ourselves. -What are you saying? -That we can move in together. How do we avoid becoming bored with each other. A profound experience. An exciting memory. Karel! An ineradicable imprint. How would you translate this? Switch it around. The trip to Saint de Vince remained a lasting memory. Before l forget. Bohunka was waiting for me at the studio yesterday. Wanted your autograph, handsome! Said you shouldn`t kid yourself. Frantisek will never divorce her. l told her not to worry. That we had a great marriage. -What the... -Only way to put the kibosh on her. Open abdominal wound. Prolapsed intestine. Ruptured spleen. Open abdominal wound. Prolapsed intestine... Severe abdominal bleeding. Fractured right femur. Concussion. Severe abdominal bleeding. Fractured right femur... -Did you call the neurologist? -Yup. Patient has been transferred to surgery. Yuck! And l had blood sausage for lunch. -l definitely wouldn`t want your job. -Old hat. They`ll wire him up, untangle his guts. He`ll wait for a liver. lf he`s lucky another donor will crash his bike. On the other hand, there are some pretty doctors here. Thanks. l have a backhoe. -You okay, sweetie? -Excuse me. Remember that morgue love story? Why did they split up? Sex? lnfidelity? Marital boredom? A week before the wedding they had a car accident. She died. -This is 130. -38 yean-old female... lt was an unbearable time. He hadn`t called in weeks. l doubt the boy`ll survive. ``Every day l am faced with death. Yet l act like an idiot... ...who thinks God is going to give him anothen chance.`` ``How about some champagne to make up, love?`` ``We can kiss and make love.`` ``Champagne? Love?`` -What`s the special occasion? -Don`t say a word. l liked your text. ``We can kiss and make love.`` The message wasn`t for me, was it? Was it? l forgave you for sleeping with her, yet you still text each other. lt`d be worse if we saw each other. You think l`m an idiot. You don`t break up with her, you ask her out! Oh, please! You`ve been sending that red-haired hussy love notes. -Am l right? -Don`t say that! Okay. l lied. l didn`t want to hurt you. You`re a great person. Not even Snow White and the Seven Dwarves give a shit! ls our relationship over? l`m not divorcing you over one text. -Why are you still living here? -Hi! -For the hot meals and clean clothes? -Please. The real estate agency called. The flat was ready three weeks ago. Wait... wait one minute... l want you out. Get it? You`re wrong. Our relationship`s never been better. Helena! Got any leftover meatballs? Yeah. -``The Novel`` -A novel tells story. What makes for a good story? -Love. -A plot. -A faux pas. -Murder. -What`s most important? -A chick. -Fun. -A coincidence. Right. A surprising event that impacts the plot. Why? So we can`t figure out the ending. You can`t hold a guy prisoner and stop him from cheating. Take Fitzgerald and Zelda. Convince the man he isn`t good enough. Not good enough? Who`s Zelda? Go back to school! Who`s read ``A Moveable Feast?`` Hemingway says Fitzgerald asked him to go to the loo to compare... -What? -Johnsons, of course. Fitzgerald`s was absolutely fine! A feeling like being stabbed with a knife. A feeling like, ``l can`t hearyou. What?`` My eyes well up with teans. l have to look away... Helenka! Send me a text sometime! -What happened? -New guy. Overdose. A feeling like being stabbed with a knife. A feeling like, ``l can`t hearyou. What?`` My eyes well up with teans. l have to look away... -l`ll be in touch! -l can`t hear you! l`ll be in touch! -Don`t you know what time it is? -Aren`t you going to invite me up? You disappear for two months. What do you expect? To destroy my life again? l was married for years yet suddenly l realized l was alone. l never expected to experience anyything as great as love again. -So you don`t call for two months. -What did l have to offer? -Another catastrophe. -l wasn`t pressuring you. l just wanted you to run your own life. l can`t lead a double life. l needed time. -But l`ve made up my mind. -Don`t worry about it. l don`t want you any more. lt took me months to admit... l`m in love with you like l`ve was in love only once before. Each day without you seems wasted. Love me! l don`t have it in me. So much emotion. Then nothing. When should l be here? Nine, eight... Seven-thirty, you wimp. Please, not that! Don`t tell me it happened again. l plunge into you like a well Two firm apples dance above me. He means tits! l told you not to read other people`s mail. He prays for another child. Says he`ll take maternity leave. Then he watches the kids and writes pornographic poems. Look! -You should`ve gone to the pageant. -He got on his knees, swore it would never happen again. Daddy`s leaving us. lt`s okay. We`ll find a new one. A better one. That`s enough! Cool it in front of the kids. Ready! Guess who it is! That bitch from Plzen again. Don`t worry. Daddy won`t leave you. Right. Because l`ll throw him out! -How could you do that to her again? -Helena, listen! A belly dancer lost her backside because of a careless surgeon. She wanted liposuction on her thighs. Maternity leave is killing me. l have a couple of gigs a month. So l got bored, okay? The surgeon mistakenly removed the fat from her right buttock. When she noticed half her backside was gone she sued the ass off him. l didn`t think maternity leave was a sacrifice. The worst thing is that Bela wants to ruin her life, too. You`re more worried about her than Bela... Ajilted wife invades a family. lmagine the explosion? lf you hadn`t made up in the Alps, you could`ve gotten some experience ...from our family over Easter. Right, Mommy? Get out! Both of you! Thanks for coming! Kids, no drinking! Give it to them! You already picked him up, huh? Where`ve you been hiding, Frantisek? Surprise! You`re smoking on your birthday? Present! lsn`t she a beauty? The best is on the way. My husband was exceptional. Mind you, he was no Balzac. But people nead his books because he gave them what they wanted. Excitement and suspense. His wife also had talent. She knew what people needed. Soil transport on cleaning teams. l was unexceptional. Fnantisek, too. But we could no longen imagine life without love. -Hi! -Hi! Helena? What`s wrong? lt was wonderful, but it won`t work. What now? l can`t handle it. l can`t. -But you said... -l`m old. -She gave me a duck. -A duck? l`m fifty-five. So what? Grandma is 75. She and Arnost have big plans. l`m going to the airport for the girls. Bohuna invited them. Frantisek! ls this another joke? -Ambulance. -What? -Just press it. Shit. Your wife is calling again. Lomena 25! Hurry! -Which ambulance is available? -Just the transport one. Who`s working? -Excuse me. -But Karel! -Helena! Helena! -Aren`t you sick of hospitals? -ls it a heart attack? Good news. Your EKG is fine. But it really hurts... Your heart? -lf you took Viagra... -No, not Viagra. lf Viagra is taken with some foods it can cause cramps. You take Viagra? Don`t worry. He just collapsed from stress. Maybe he just ate too much. We`ll keep him overnight to be sure. -You wouldn`t do that! -Would so! l`ll say Dad went a bit crazy, but now it`s okay. When the family was together things were fine. The girls... Look at me. The girls have to come home. We`ll go hiking. -l had a little heart attack. -Heart attack my foot! Guilty conscience. What luck! Yesterday his EKG was fine, and now a heart attack. She`ll never leave him or divorce him. She would rather kill him. -Love til death do us part. -You`re awful. ln my case it was an obsession. -Life is too short... -And her legs are too long... And nonsense like living life to the fullest. All these years you only showed one side of yourself. Jealousy. lt drove me away. l lost interest in your affairs long ago. Only two people know the secret to maintaining a marriage: Bohunka and Frantisek. l`d like to marry you again. May l? The 25 years with you were more than sufficient. -l thought so! -Right? ``Seven Months Later`` Adam went back to the studio and Bela was a housewife. Come home from work soon, Daddy! Lots of kisses... -Bastik. -Your darling. Frantisek divorced in Octoben, but still lived with his wife. lt`s like they`re imitating us. What is most important is that you two guys are friends. My husband finished his novel. There! lt`s done! l kept waiting fora miracle. ``Where ane you, love?`` l`m here! -Hi! -Hi! Hi! Unfortunately Karel was with me. Yet without Kanel oun story wouldn`t have a happy ending. -Would you read my new novel? -Sure. What`s it called? -``You Kiss Like God.`` -What`s it about? They were fifty, but they were in love... ...like a couple of twenty year-olds. l made you younger to make it look better. -Did the morgue make it in? -They met there at twenty. She dies in a car accident. Theirs is ``love until death do us part``, so he wants to end his life. But a female friend with two kids takes him in. -l didn`t tell you everything... -The author must make something up. Don`t read it! We look like fools who fall for everything. He and Bohuna are the smart ones. -And you die! -Really? Not from a heart attack. A train runs you over. -Can l read it, too? -Certainly. Don`t worry. The funeral`s funny. Your mobile is beeping as they lower your coffin into the grave. Karel embellished oun story. l don`t know if Fnantisek in the book nealizes thene`s no next life and what is not now neverwill be. Finally we were alone on Chnistmas. Just the two of us. But you shouldn`t jump the gun. You never know what might happen tomonrow, let alone in an houn. l bet you don`t have today`s paperfor Frantisek. -For God`s sake! -l also brought an antenna, so he can watch the hockey. -Hi! -Hi, Mom! -Hi! Merry Christmas! -Hey, Sis! -Hi! -Hurry! -Wait! -Wait for me! -Wait for mom! Kids! l brought your nativity scene. Bumblebee! What are you doing in the chair with shoes on? Go clean off the icy steps. Not even Snow White and the Seven Dwarves give a shit! You better not spoil him! She`ll give him back to me one day. lt`s as warm as in a manger... -Quiet now! Let`s play! -Color! -Super! This is how oun family wonks. Thene are mone and mone of us. We`re all together once again. Hope things`ll stay calm for a bit. Unless a storm hits... -Looks like l have a boyfriend. -Serious? He kisses like God. l hope he isn`t married. Story, Screenplay Director Starring This is going to be harsh. Want a schnitzel? Don`t pick him up. Cover the wound with a bedsheet! Does it really have to be a bedsheet? Shit! Stab wound to the abdomen. Bread knife. l can`t even find my smokes in this mess. Towels, diapers. Whateven! Clean ones! He`s talking nonsense. He`s having chills. First he pisses me off. Better not croak on me. -No food or drink! -How about moonshine? Where the fuck are they? -Where are you? -Where do you think? ln hell! -Gran, what`s an idietch? -A compound from idiot and wretch. -But your dad hates bad words. -Professor Altmanova? l`m telling Bastik not to use bad words. Can l say shit when dad isn`t home? Subtitled by FlLMPRlNT s.r.o.
