I'm on my way to Gislaved, to Emma Örtlund. A couple of years ago I received a letter from Emma. Emma describes her longing to be beautiful, be seen and occupy space. "Hey, Pär. My name is Emma Örtlund and I live in Småland. I have a special charisma, and wonder if you can help me become a model. I have the charisma required, and a photographer friend thinks so too. I've dreamed of this my whole life, so, what do you say?" The letter touched me greatly, because... it put words to so many things I experience in our society, and what I do, and everything I believe in. My job is to help those who haven't had the chance to be seen and shine. I think Emma really deserves it. So the letter is the starting point for why we're on this journey. CATWALK FROM GLADA HUDIK TO NEW YORK - Hey! - Hey, Emma! - Are you standing in the stairs? - I wasn't sure if you'd found it. - It's so nice to see you. - You too! - Is this where you live? - This is where I live. - Is my lipstick messy? - You look great. Thanks so much. - What a lovely apartment you have. - Thank you so much. - It's fantastic. - Yes, it's absolutely fantastic. It's original '80s, that clown, the pink one over there. You wrote a letter to me. I read it many times, and thought about it and lay sleepless. "What am I going to do?" I told you I was on tour but that wasn't really true. Oh no?! I'm here to tell you that I'm going to try to help you fulfil your dream, that you're going to be a real model. Oh my god, amazing! You're going to walk on a catwalk. I'm so happy! Oh my god! Is this "Candid Camera"? Wow! Wow, I'm so happy! - Hey, Ida! - Hey, there. - Hey. How are you? - I'm great. - I've got some amazing news. - What is it? Pär told me that I'm going to be photographed as a model and walk on a catwalk. And you will too! - Really? - Yes, really, Ida! Wow, gosh, how amazing! You have such fantastic charisma and you're so beautiful! - Damn, how amazing! - It's so amazing! - So you and me? - Yes, and a few others. SIX MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK I've called you here for a reason. Together, we're going to do a fashion show, our own catwalk. Ida, you're going to transform the catwalk into something special. Yes, I can do that. I don't think anyone's ever seen a ballerina dance around on a catwalk. Hillberg, you're Glada Hudik Theatre's own primadonna. You have all the necessary qualities. You're beautiful and you have your own style. - You like glitter too, right? - Mm. Kitty, you're a person who embodies fashion. You're a mix of culture and fashion that I've never seen. Alex, you're a very thoughtful person who can hold the group together well. You have a charisma that needs to be absorbed. - And Emma... - Yes? You're the reason we're sitting here. Yes. I think you should have the chance to shine together with everyone else. I think so too. I think everyone's charisma makes this something very magical. - It's a dream. - Yes. It's really a dream to do this. I've never been seen before in my life. I could never have imagined that I'd be part of something like this. - This is a real crying party. - Sorry, they're tears of happiness! - Happiness now. - Yes. - We'll start by watching a film. - Okay. Then you'll see. - Can you see yourselves there? - Yes. You could see there that she had a little smile, compared to her. I think that's how you should look when you walk. Oh? Could you look that serious? No, I'd have been happy, to show that it's fun. - Don't they think it's fun? - They're probably very unhappy... because they have to diet, I think. - Are we going to diet for this? - No, that's not necessary. You should be able to do things regardless of how you look or how you are. The more we show how we are as people, that we're all different and unique in our different ways, I actually think the clothes can become more and more beautiful. What do you think, Hillberg? - There. - Yes. I have to ask... Can we do this? - Yes. - Absolutely. It'll be a tough but fantastic journey. I don't think we can do it alone. - No... - We need help. I think it's really important to be a model. I want people to see that people like us who have disabilities are also unique people. This is more me than the job I have now. - Hey, there. - Hey. - I'd like some coffee, please. - Yes. Coming right up. So... there you go. - There, yes. - A biscuit and coffee. So, Andreas. I have some amazing news to tell you. - Oh? - Yes, Pär Johansson... is going to help me realise my big dream of becoming a photo model and walk on a catwalk. - What's a catwalk? - It's a fashion show. You strut like this and wear nice clothes. - It's hard, right? - You just do this. I'll show you. Oh... Yep. Pär is so nice. I think he'll make my dream possible. - Hey. - Hey! Three pieces of sponge cake. You can put them on a napkin. There you go. My problems... I have epilepsy. I've had it since I was 15. The medicines didn't work on me. So I had seizures really often. I had it a lot at school in the dining hall and at the bus stop. So I stayed at home, and didn't do anything. I didn't go out anywhere. I didn't dare go out for five years. I was so very scared of having seizures. I was very lonely. I was so lonely. Glada Hudik Theatre is comprised of people with a passion for what we're doing. I'm good at finding people who are better than me. Who improve this. I shoot an arrow and people follow it. Sometimes it misses the target and others have to get it back on track. So I'm probably a really annoying leader, I think. - You're looking very serious! - No. We're focused. This will lead to a fashion show starting in Hudiksvall. And then it'll go somewhere. I've decided, the group doesn't know yet, that we're going to New York. For fashion week. - No... - Yes. I can't do it alone, that's why you're here. The group doesn't know that it's New York and they don't know it's New York because then they'd miss the journey there. The journey is just as important. You're saying New York... How certain is that? I see it is about 83% certain. - Venue? - Venue, I'm working on that. We start with a traditional fashion show. Model 1, 2, 3, 4 will display clothes that are placed on bodies within that industry. Everyone looks the same. We'll break that mould. How will the actual... I've got a thousand thoughts. Will there be five models? How many costume changes. How long will the show be? We're not after quantity, we're after quality. So I think... I've never done a fashion show but it should be between 15 and 18 minutes. I don't know what makes me say that, but it feels good. It shouldn't be too long. It should be vigorous, efficient and have forward momentum. - Questions? - A thousand questions. Chrystal clear and a thousand questions. We're here for a reason. During this journey, you will become a team. You'll work together. We're doing something tomorrow. I want you to be ready in warm clothes at 9 o'clock tomorrow. - Nine... what did you say? - Nine o'clock. We're going dog sledding. Ida doesn't look too happy. I can see myself falling down. - Have you done it before? - No. I've never done it before. - There's no ice or anything? - Yes, we're going out on the ice. So, I found them. Pink earplugs. Kitty. Here. There you go. - Do you want earplugs, Nicklas? - No, I've got these. - I don't know if I can do it, Kitty. - Yeah, you can. I've got nerves right now. I'm surely going to fall. - Get on here. - Ida, you won't fall off. You can hold onto me. - It'll go great. - Ida, how does it feel? Ida? I don't understand why I'm doing it. We're overcoming our fears and dare to come past this. Right? - Yes. That's what I have to do. - You're already on the dogsled. Yes... But they haven't started. - So. Lean back against me. - I don't know... - I'll wet myself soon. - Are you scared? - I'm wetting myself! - Ida says she'll wet herself soon. Ida! Look! Watch. Now hold on! - Are you okay? - Yes! Here we go! - God, it's amazing! - Isn't it! Yes. Hey, Pär? I've overcome my fear! Now we're going downhill! So much fun! God, it's amazing. Wonderful. It's wonderful to get to know the gang. I'm going to be one of them. It's like I fit in here. There's so much joy and strength. We believe in each other. We've all helped out. We're strong together. FIVE MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK - Here I am, Dad! - Hey, honey! - Wow, have you hung up the paintings? - Yes. I think they're so nice. - I can understand that. I painted that picture... when I was in high school. I really wanted to go to the ball, I remember that. I thought it would be like Cinderella's ball. I dreamed and fantasised a lot about being the queen of the ball. A guy would be the king of the ball. But I had so much anxiety and was bullied and harassed. So it was a horrible time. I felt bad every day I went to school. - How awful that you had that anxiety. - Yes. It was really awful. At school they yelled at me and called me spastic every day and pushed me into walls. They messed with me, a lot. They weren't nice. I didn't feel welcome at that school. But you did something then, that wasn't so great. It was really something you shouldn't do. I thought, "If they're mean to me today, I'll damn well go and get a big spitball - and spit on one of them." - Oh yeah, that was it. I thought, it's free. I'd planned to take ketchup or something with me and tip it on them. But I thought Dad would get mad and ketchup costs money. - "No, I won't do that." - So it was a spitball instead. Yeah, that's what it was instead. What's wrong with me? Am I really that ugly? They'll see I'm a fantastic and beautiful person. That's what I want them to see. Now we'll do our own catwalk and it will be fairly unrestricted. I'm cleaning out all the wardrobes at home. I found lots of sheets. They'll be our clothes. Here are lots of sheets. We'll put them on and make our own creations out of this. Yes. - Okay... - You look so sceptical. You have to be creative! Everyone, take a sheet. Alex! It's easier to improvise if you have something on. - Put a sheet on! - Look. - I don't know. - There! - Isn't that good? - Yeah, absolutely. - Now I've created something. - We look like a gospel choir. Check out how good he looks, gospel guy Alex. - You look like Tomas Di Leva. - Is it a sheet for a double bed? Imagine you're in a real fashion show. Let's do the groundwork for this. Three, two, one, there you go. Do you see who's arrived? - Hey! Nice to see you. - You too! Our catwalk is becoming more like an art installation. We've chosen to start the catwalk with how it was for the developmentally handicapped in Sweden at the start of the 1900s. - Do you know how it was? - Yes, a little. - It wasn't as good as it is now. - No. I've brought some photos from institutions that show what it looked like. - They're not pleasant images. - No, they're really not. - No. - It really pisses me off. Damn. Yuck! You just don't do that. Everyone is equally valuable, I think. - This was pretty unpleasant to see. - Yeah, really unpleasant. I recognised many of their expressions in the pictures from when I was little and went to school because since childhood I've always been bullied just because I was different to all the others. The expressions of emptiness, loneliness and despair, for years, every day, 24 hours a day. You shouldn't need to be behind bars just because you're different. No... Is it unpleasant that I show you this? A little. What I want is for us to make a statement where we say that this isn't okay. In many other countries it's still like this. That's how the catwalk will begin. Frida has something with her. This is a straitjacket. The catwalk will start with Ida standing... I'll be wearing that. I'll show the world that I'm free! We will overcome all the shit. This won't be a regular catwalk, but an art installation that touches, engages, and will be long-wearing. It will be like a kick in the gut. Everyone will consider how they want to live their life, who is seen. My dream is that everyone in the group will be an outstretched arm to everyone who never got the chance to shine. And that... to shut the mouths of everyone who bullied them over a long period of time. Why I want to take it to New York is a combination of things. I'm proud that we in Sweden have come so far with the kind of work I do. I also want to spread our way of thinking, make it global. The hardest place in the world to do that might be New York. - When were you thinking? - Fashion Week is 6-15 September. - Sometime during then. - You're choosing a week... - Do you think it's impossible? - It's a very hard week. It's the busiest week in New York. Everything costs a million dollars to rent. It's very late to find anything good. I know. That's why I came to you. I know you're opening there. Have you got a venue where we can do the catwalk? A traditional catwalk with audience, photographers and everything? Yes, we're doing the whole... We have a designer doing the clothes. Choreographers, music, everything. Unfortunately it doesn't help in your search for a venue that you have designers... No, I know. We're not sparing any costs. We're opening in New York, we're opening before Fashion Week. Or, the same week, is the idea. But it's a worksite. Nobody knows it will be finished, but it's the goal. Give me a few weeks, I'll see what we can do. Okay, gang. We're going to walk on a catwalk. You'll do a joint number so we get a feeling of team spirit going. We need the beats and choreographed steps. Let's give it a try. From the start. Let's go. Right. Left. Hold it. We come forward. Click, click, click... Let's do it... Then right, left. - There. How did it go? - A bit fast, but otherwise great. When I stand here, I'll help out. I've got a head start since I designed the steps. It's new for you. - But we'll let you try it yourselves. - Okay. Super! We have to work more on the pulse so you feel it. When we do something together, we rely on the beat, especially if the music has a lot of pulse, like this one will. - I can't do that. - Tell me why. My motor skills aren't what they should be. They're not good at all. The whole catwalk project and choreography is a challenge for me. I'm afraid if I do something, I might fall. Even when I was young, I had bad balance and motor skills. I was very sick and had a congenital heart condition. I was in hospital a lot, my parents were very worried about me. - And those two there. - I'm happy I'm where I am today, and get to do what I've dreamed of. It's been my biggest dream, to do a fashion show, to dance... the whole thing. - How does the catwalk feel? - Good. That one got away. Have you got a girlfriend or boyfriend? A boyfriend. - A boyfriend? Who? - Magnus Carlsson. Magnus Carlsson. Yes. - How did you meet? - Yes, we have. - Are you together? - Yes... That's good. - What's your favourite band? - ABBA. - Can you time now? Seven minutes. - Yes. Have you got an eye on it? Can you sing something from Mamma Mia? - I want music. - Which song do you know best? - "Mamma Mia". - We'll try that one, then. - Let's see it! Choreography too? - Yes! - Hillberg, how long has it been? - There are five minutes left. These must be the longest six minutes in world history. - Have you got your eye on the clock? - Yes. There can't be five minutes left. It was six minutes, five minutes ago. - Yes, it is! - But are you timing? Yes. - It's time now. - It's time now? Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. FOUR MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK When I started working with this, I heard all the limitations they had. If you always focus on the limitations, there's no progress. What I've seen over all the years we've worked, is that when we pose challenges, changes happen. Everyone who means anything in a context, and get affirmation that, "here I am," and "I exist," that's when people start to grow. - Have you started? - Yes. - Have you started watching? - Mm. - You really suit glitter. - Thank you. Is it you who... You didn't bring this, did you? Yeah, I did. We want to express: Who are Emma, Ida, Nicklas, Alex and Kitty? There are lots of butterflies. - You like that, Kitty. - Yes. - What were you thinking? - I like glitter and sequins. Ballerina dresses. With golden shoes, silver cardigan... White, glittery ballerina dress. Gold necklace, various flowers in my hair and bracelets. Yes. - Who's finished? - I'm finished! - Hillberg, are you finished? - Finished! - Is this you, Nicklas? - Yes. When Frida does your clothes, what should she keep in mind? - ABBA. - Yes, it's ABBA. - You're a bit ABBA. - Yes. - What else? - A dress. You're fantastic at expressing yourself. This is all you. Yes. I feel a bit of pressure to live up to their visions. Many of them want extravagance with a train and to feel like princesses. I'm a bit like that too. - Shall we do the ballgown? - Yes, please! With a lot of tulle. I like tulle. And a nice silk rosette at the waist, I'd like that on the princess dress. I get lots of inspiration from you and what you like. Yes. - We'll see how I can put it together. - Exactly, yes. - It's exciting. - So exciting! - Would you like some cordial? - Yes, please. - Look how beautiful Mum was. - Yes, she was so beautiful. - How old was she in those pictures? - That was before we met. She must have been around 20. - That's really beautiful. - She looks like a model. She looks like a real model. I asked Mum, before she died, "Did you never consider being a photo model?" And she said, "No, I never considered it." I've considered it for a long time. I really want to be one. That's beautiful. That's her friend, Barbro. Is that Barbro? The one who was there at... - Mum's funeral. - I didn't know that was her. I miss her so much, every single day. I miss saying "Mum". - I miss doing that. - Yes... Imagine if I could ring Mum, and tell her about the catwalk. I'd love to do that. Unfortunately I can't call her, because she's up in heaven. There you go, Mum. There... Nice. Really nice. Forward again. Great. Put your hand down. Great. Nice! Stay there. Nice. - Welcome! - Thank you so much. You can hang your clothes over here. Get the clothes you have with you, and we'll choose clothes for the photo shoot. - Absolutely! - Come! Great! If you could choose a city to take the catwalk to, where would it be? I'd choose either Stockholm or Gothenburg. - Gävle. - Gävle? Okay. I have to tell them now. We'll sort out a venue. We have to book hotels and get visas. I know. But they need to know where we're going. Alexander, a little more this way. Ida, come forward a little more. Great work, guys. So wonderful! Everyone, our catwalk is going to New York! What?! - Really? - Yep. I don't believe it. Wow! - I've always dreamed of New York. - We're going to do the catwalk... at Fashion Week in New York. That's when everything happens. - And we'll be there too. - I always wanted to go to New York. - Have you? - Yes. Perfect. There. Perfect. Look into the camera. So nice! - Now it's all-in '80s. - It sure is. - Is that me? - That's you. - How does it feel? - Great, so fun and totally unreal. Perfect. Wow! There it is! THREE MONTHS UNTIL THE CATWALK Hey, Alex. The catwalk is getting closer. We're practicing proud posture. Back straight and chest high. We'll put a book on your head. You can try walking around keeping a straight back. You'll need it on the catwalk later. Practice, practice, practice your posture, Alex. Ugh, bloody hell... Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Bam, bam, stop. Bam, bam, stop. Snake, snake, snake. It's been really hard to remember the steps to the dance, that we'll do on the catwalk. It's difficult and complicated. We'll do a turn as well. Back up a bit. It's these turns we'll do furthest down the catwalk. Put one foot out. Then turn around, and then continue. We'll walk a bit further this way. Foot out and turn around to get a new focus. - How did it feel? - You get a bit dizzy. - A bit dizzy? - Yes. I get a bit dizzy and swaying. - It's not dangerous to get dizzy. - I'm just afraid of... my epilepsy... And the fear of having a seizure is there as well. I have a fear of that as well. Now we have the opportunity to create new associations around spins and turns. So after the catwalk they'll be your favourite thing. - My favourite things, okay. - Well done, Emma. Here comes another part of the catwalk. This applies to you, Kitty. You're going to do something else, not just walk. Annika, what's she going to do? - You're going to sing. - Okay! It's a song called "Silhouettes", an Avicii song. It'll be a calm version. You'll enter in your glittery costume, and stand there in the middle and sing. Have you sung in English? Just once, it was pretty average. - We'll meet later and go through it. - Thank you. Good. We've got a bit to practice. You can go through the steps, so we have some working material to go from. I didn't really follow that. You can practice this. Repetition will help us eventually remember so that it sits in your body. Come on people, we have all seen... "All." It means "alla". We have all... And then all the way back to the centre. And forward. Good! - How did the spin feel? - A bit dizzy. - A bit dizzy? - Yes. Come with me. Stretch out, pick an apple here, an apple there. Pick an apple there, and pick an apple there. Come back to the centre. Then turn around. Good. - Do you know what you just did? - Yes. That. - You did a spin. - A spin. Wow! You did a spin by picking apples. What you actually did, was to... You do the same thing, but you're not thinking about it. Oh yeah, I wasn't think about it. I think I'm a bit nervous, especially when it comes to singing the song in that it's the very first time I'm doing it. In a country and city I've never been to and can't even speak the language. Why it's so important to me to be seen isn't because I think I'm special. I want to convey what I'm like as a person, so that others who think there's a problem with disabled people... To show them we're not less valuable. Okay, maybe we're different, yes. I admit, I have a pair of makeup sunglasses that I made that I've worn in town, yes. I dress in a mix of styles, that might not always fit together. But that's who I am, and I'm not ashamed to be different. I found out that certain kids here in town think I'm retarded, deformed, dumb, and stupid. Many think that about us, but we'll change that, here and now and on the catwalk. Since we saw each other last, I've thought and sketched and considered your sketches and who you are and I've tried to interpret that in my design. Here, we have glitter. So you can be glitter deluxe. Oh, beautiful! Then there's the wedding dress: a white lace, glitter flowers. - Dramatic train. - It's beautiful. - Do you think it'll be good? - Yes, I think so. - It'll do? - Yeah, it'll do. - Are you prepared? - No, but let's do it. I'm thinking a real butterfly dream, since you're the butterfly woman. Yes. You've got butterflies everywhere. It's so lovely. The butterfly really represents freedom and breaking free. Then there's one more. We have more glitter. Do you think it will be good? Yes. It would be nice to add more butterflies. - On this one too? - Yes, exactly. If it's possible. In this one, there will be masses of butterflies and flowers. In this one there's more focus on the glitter and the skirt and movement. It's fun when you make two creations that they're a bit different. - Do you mean I get two collections? - Oh, yes. First, you'll come out in that one, than you go backstage, and change into this one, so you'll have both. - You're joking? - No. Oh my god! - You scared me! Are you that happy? - Yes! Come here. That makes me so happy. - I'm crying tears of happiness. - Me too. Sorry. - You're so lovely. - Thank you, so are you. I really wish you ere my real sister. How sweet! She has so much love. Nobody should ever be mean to such a lovely person. God... She's totally fantastic. ONE MONTH UNTIL THE CATWALK We have to think. What's the first impression we want to give the public when they arrive? I'd like to give... What atmosphere do you want to create? I want to create the atmosphere that I, as a person, am very unsure, shy, timid, and happily pulls away. So I'm thinking this shy, and unsure feeling. And I'm so... I find strength and power. "Here I am." "You don't ignore me. I'm here and want to give you joy. Accept it now." That will make it even more powerful, that there's an intention. It will be like a liberation. Let's go with that. Hello, Pär. Jane Broman from Fotografiska. I'm in New York and looking at the building. Everything is very delayed. It's chaos, it's just a huge construction site. You'll have to find a venue some other way. This won't work, unfortunately. Good luck, Pär. - New York! - You've made it so nice. Thanks so much. - Yeah, wow... - Nice! So nice, Nicklas. It'll be so much fun to go to New York. - I don't believe it. - Me neither. I don't either. We've booked flights and hotels. Everything is ready. The problem is the venue, but we're working day-round on it. It's the 14th of September. - Now? - Yes. Oh! We have a dream to make the catwalk at Fashion Week in New York in September. September is less than one month away. Because it's the Fashion Week. Pär set the stakes high when he said we're going to New York and that it's all sorted. - It wasn't all sorted. - The venue isn't sorted. - Are you joking? - No, it's true. And that's a concern. I have promised all the people in the project to go to New York this week. So I cannot say no now. Do you have any advice where we can be to have the catwalk? No, unfortunately I don't. We need a location in Manhattan, and we need a place for 200-300 people. It's really soon, and there's a lot of stuff happening right now. I mean just to be upfront, it might be really expensive. I didn't think the challenge of a venue would be so extreme. But now it is. We've searched like mad, but we can't find one. We've looked at 30-40 different places but nothing has worked. The situation is getting a bit dicey. Time is running out, there are one and a half weeks left. We've had contact with a woman who might have a solution. Hi, Sofia. This is Pär Johansson from Sweden. Hello, how are you? I'm not so good at English but I hope you're gonna help me, so... Yeah, I will help you. We have two floors, we have a showroom upstairs, and a big ballroom downstairs where the show actually takes place. We also have a VIP press lounge which of course everyone in your team will have access to. I must open the window here, because this is such good news. - Oh, thank you! - I don't believe it, but... - If you say it's true, I believe you! - Oh, no, it's true! This is my best phone call ever. Oh, thank you! It's a pleasure speaking with you. - Same to you. Bye. - Bye, bye. Wow! This is a studio where you can do lots of different things. You can make it into almost anything. It fits more people, and has more room to do what we're going to do. Since we're rehearsing now and this is the last week, we have to do a proper catwalk. One, two, three, four... ONE WEEK UNTIL THE CATWALK I'm going to put Swarovski crystals in these flowers. You'll glitter like nothing else... You're totally magical! You're getting all... - What are you picking? - I've decided I'm picking stars. Stars, okay. - Which star will you take first? - Mum's star in heaven. It's called Solveig, because Mum's name was Solveig. We'll gather here, everyone! It's the last day, and we're going to do a dress rehearsal. It's new for everyone. The clothes and movements are new for you. It's new to all the dressers here. So we've decided that we'll do number one, two, three and four until lunch. Everyone will do their own change and practice getting into the rhythm. Yes, so we're waiting for Kitty. How did you get here? Since I can't sit without my back almost folding up... - I walked here. - You walked here with crutches? It was either that or lay in bed at home. We're doing a run through with the clothes. But how do you feel? Is it serious? I feel like I have so much to learn. - Try walking and see how it feels. - So I can join in if it gets better. Absolutely. That's why I want to be here and try. - You're great. Take your time. - Okay. It's nothing to be sorry for. Now we're rehearsing for real. We're in New York now. We seem ready! Let's do the first run through of the catwalk. Off you go! Good, Ida! I feel really sorry for Kitty, that she's got such bad back pain. I really feel bad looking at her. Good! That's great! I feel really worried. What happens to the catwalk if Kitty can't come with us to New York? Really well done, everyone! Go home, satisfied with your work. You've been insanely good. Soon, we're flying to New York. We're doing this! Yes! - I'll fan you a bit. - Oh, how nice! - There. - That's better. What if I can't do that? I'm the one leading you, I go first. - It would be chaos. - It would be. - No, it's easy for me. - It's easy for you? Yes. - You never make mistakes? - No. I'm afraid there will be gangsters coming up to us if we walk alone in New York. I have a lot of fear. People are usually stressed in New York. They usually run, they walk quickly. I walk fast, so that I can't see my shoes. So sometimes my shoelaces are undone and I trip on them. So I might embarrass myself there, and when I dance with you. Or something. I think he's asleep now. I feel very excited and really want to show everyone who has unkind preconceptions of us that we'll damn well show them that they're wrong. God, I'm so pumped. This is going to be so much fun! - Has everyone got their passports? - Yes! - Is this your first time in the USA? - Yes, it is. I'm so excited! - I can't believe this is New York. - Me neither. I still don't believe it. Are we really in New York? Should we try to take a picture with this beautiful background? Yes, let's. Excuse me, can you take a picture of us? We have to stand together. Ida, come forward here. Jump down here, Ida. - It's beautiful. - Thank you! Are you a model? You are so tall and thin. - So nice of you. No, I'm not a model. - Okay. You're very beautiful. Thank you! You are too. Have a nice day. Have a nice day too! - Did she look like a model? - Yes, very much. Have you got a question? Just a minute. What were you going to ask? Are you nervous to walk the catwalk on Saturday? Yes. I'm a little nervous when I go on the catwalk in Saturday. But I think... Yeah! This is very fun! And it is so great. What are your personal icons, personal inspiration? We're talking about fashion, so what can you guys share? I love the '80s very much. Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci. Yeah! I love it very much. One second, please. Why are you doing the catwalk? What's the purpose? We're doing it because we want to show the world that we're just as unique and good in our own ways despite our disabilities. We also want to try to create joy and happiness for those who don't get to experience this. Give them hope that they can achieve great dreams they carry with them. If you have a great dream you've dreamed since you were little, I think you should... realise it, quite simply, through contacting... - Me. - Yeah, you or someone else. Tiffany & Company. And Gucci. - Dolce & Gabbana! - Look at those sunglasses! Yeah. I love this jacket. It costs... - This one is $848. - Okay... I have trouble with money and it's value. - It's a hundred-something, right? - If you think... - Almost 700,000 for a jacket. - Almost 700,000 for a jacket. Mine cost a thousand-something as well, I think. So add a zero. One more zero. Yes, then it's a thousand. That's expensive. I'd like one of these. Me too. I wish I had it. Thank you. Thank you! - They were so good! - Yeah, really good. - They guys were good. - The guys. - They were better. - You thought they were better? - They showed their underpants! - Underpants! Yes, that's better! What a cheer from Nicklas when the guys came in. Yes! - Lucky they weren't naked. - Yeah, thank god! I probably would have fainted. - Not over there, over here! - Come on, Nicklas. Come on, Nicklas! Do you remember when I visited you in Gislaved? Yes. I remember that. Now we're here. Yes, now we're here. It's totally unbelievable. I've actually noticed how I've developed. I've become more self-assured and more confident in some way. I've matured a lot, I think. I feel much happier now than what I did before. - Look at this. - I see. - The whole world will look at you. - The whole world will look at me. It's completely unbelievable. Pär... Tomorrow, this town is ours. THREE HOURS UNTIL THE CATWALK I think a marking has ended up in the wrong place, or we've measured wrong. - Hello! - Hey! It's going to be so much fun! I thought we'd gather. Put down your things. - Here we are. - Yes, here we are. - Do you see where we're standing? - Yeah, on our catwalk! I thought we'd go through where our markings are. - Markings? - Come and look. - Here. You stand there, Emma. - What did you say? Stand on that line. That's where you stand when you make an entrance. Entrance, okay. - You stand there too, Hillberg. - I know. One more thing. Here, when you turn, you walk out toward this edge. And when you turn again, you stand like this. Is it the wedding dress, is it there we walk to? I don't understand. Wait, Emma. Just like you did in Hudik. - Yes. - There was a cross in Hudik. - Now they're lines. - I don't really understand. Wait. You'll understand it really well. It's very structured, you can relax. Put on your dressing gown and we'll get started. It's hard and complicated. If it goes wrong, I'm worried and afraid that the audience will think we're weird because we can't do it. That we're stupid and bad. Shall I walk along the edge or do a U? - I don't believe I can do it. - You can. Pär says one thing, and lots of other people say another thing. - So I get mixed up in my head. - I understand. Annika, Sanna and I, we trust you. We know... We've been with you for awhile now, and you're professional. You don't need to be worried. You'll own the room tonight. People will fall off their chairs. I have pain in my tailbone and have no crutches to relieve my back. Lean on me. That's great. Now we'll get one of Kitty's crutches. Here! - Look, Alex. - Thank you. I'm a bit worried about the pain, that I'm dealing with at the moment and have for some time now. But I'm not going to let it stop me. Hey, guys. Gather on the stage at half past, in 15 minutes. I feel excited and nervous. A bit anxious. But I also think that I'll just be myself take it easy and have fun. I'm normal. This is how I look. And nobody can change that. Places, everyone! Let's go. Not long ago, disabled people like me were hidden away in big institutions. Parents were often advised to give us away... and forget we were born. This is still the case in some countries today. We want this to change, that's why we are here today. I never apologise for who I am. I am proud and I want respect. Things have moved on and now it's time to shine. Bravo! That was flawless! - Quickly now. - Let's go! If Mum could see me, she'd think, "My little girl, wow! She has talent. She looks like a real photo model from Vogue magazine." - It went wonderfully! - Yes! I love this job! Dear friends, honoured guests, the one and only Emma Örtlund! I am so happy. And I think it's very fun that I'm here today. And Janne... There are two princesses here in New York today! Every time I work with Emma, I feel free. I feel happiness. How come? I can not explain it... Give the next question to her. We are beautiful and Down's Syndrome are beautiful. It's time for them to shine too, I think. Thank you so much! You're very beautiful people! - How did that feel? - It was totally magical. And absolutely, absolutely wonderful. - What will you do now? - Now we'll go and shop! Look! I'm in Amelia, on the cover! And I'm inside the magazine! I'm a model! Do you know how to get the wood upstairs? You burn it up! - Hillberg! - Yes. - Wake up! - I am awake. - No, you're asleep. - No! - Shut up, Pär. - "Shut up, Pär"?!
