See! There comes the little princess! Come on, Per. - No! Look who's there! - It's Uncle Anders! I have never seen anything like that! Boo!! No, where did you make me... Are you here too? Yes, we are celebrating the last day of the holiday. In the morning, the seriousness of life begins, and Per's first day at school. - Yes, you have become a big boy! - Yes, oops! Do you know what? Then I want to invite you for a ride up the slide. - Don't let me... - Don't let me... Don't you get dizzy on the slide? Don't talk about! You are a healthy and fit young man. I think Uncle Anders looks a little pale. What is it, Anders? Have you gotten sick? No, not at all! It just rocks a little. Dad, can we ask for money for a candyfloss? - What is that? - It's edible cotton wool. Pink! Damn it! Yes go ahead. You can run around a bit for yourselves. Maybe you are going to drink beer? Now I've never heard anything like it! It was a good idea by the way. - What do you think? - Yes, let go. - Look who's standing there! - No! It's Kjeld and Hanne! - Hey, Kjeld. - Hello! Dad! Don't you want to say hello to Ole, Mie and Little Per? They were the ones we played with last summer. I am glad to meet you. Good day. Yes, we stand and shop. May I present you with a small present? - Yes, thank you, but that is far too much. - No, he has enough money. Per though! - You can choose just what you want. - Well thank you. Don't you want one like that? - Well, thank you. - Here you go. - Thanks. - And what do you want, Little Per? - That one. - A mouth harmonica? Then you must also promise to play a little piece for us. Here you go. Thanks. Here you go, hold it. You can taste. - I don't think he can play. - Yes, you can believe that he can! Well, you must say goodbye, it's late. - Goodbye, children. - Shall you stay in here? Yes, we have been allowed to see the fireworks. Yes, I've been looking forward to it for a whole year! No! That we also had to sleep over ourselves today! Hurry up, or you'll be too late! - Don't worry, Sis, we're done. - Ole, have you snatched my pencil case? - Well, I haven't. - Aarh, then it's up there! - Do you have my lunch? - Here you go, little father. Thank you. Tell me, have you thought about going to the office in those morning shoes? It was good that you discovered it! - Now what about Little Per? - He first has to meet in half an hour. - It was good. - So we don't make it... Nonsense, we're setting a speed record. Bye-bye, Sis! - Bye-bye! - Goodbye! Good morning, Uncle Anders, we don't have time. Hey, Uncle Anders, we're so busy! Good morning, Uncle Anders. What will you? I mean, goodbye, goodbye! Tell me, is it a trot or a canter-race? No, we overslept. They were all just about to be late. - It was nice of you to come. - Well, I would love to do that. - Well, now I'm done. Let's go. - Fine. - And where is the boy? - The boy? Yes, Per. As far as I know, he is the one we have to follow to school. No! Would you believe I had forgotten him! - Per? Are you up there? - No! Well, sweetest child, why are you sitting there? Because I don't want to go to school! I told you not to climb into that cupboard. Now I'll go up and get your thornyst. Why on earth don't you want to go to school? Because I can neither read nor write. Well, that's what you have to learn over there! Are you sure? Ouch! What happened? Oh, my foot! I think I must have sprained my left foot. It was horrible though! Should I help you? No thanks, I'll handle it. Only you want to follow Per to school, otherwise he will be late. Come on, Per. Then we go to school. Wait a minute, Uncle Anders, I forgot something. Good morning, Uncle Anders. Well, where are you going so early? I still have to go to school. Well, Per though! I just want to say goodbye to you, little Sis. Oh, that was nice of you, baby. - Can you be nice now? - I don't know, but I can try. - Going to school will be fun. - No, I don't care about that. Now you are too big to say that. What's it called? - I don't worry about that. - Yes. Do you remember it now? Yes, I'm just thinking about Danish breads. - I think we should go in, Uncle Anders. - Hard to tell. There are an awful lot of doors. But we'll try it there, right? - Yes. - We can always come out again. What a long walk there! It's an awful lot of doors though... Yes, I think we have gone wrong. Yes, stay here and I'll find out. Whoa, you there! - What pleases? - You don't know where I'm going, do you? Going? Oh! You are one of the new ones. Welcome, my boy. Your class is around the corner, the second door to the right. Thanks. Oops! - Tell me, are you all alone? - No, Uncle Anders is here too. But he is so confused that he cannot be counted on. Hello! - Good day, little friend. What's your name? - My name is per. Can you take off your hat and go over to the others? Yes. Now I think we are all here. So can you find you a desk every one? Are you shy? Does no one want to start? Yes, I do! Yes, that was nice. And let me see who will sit next to Per. - Whoa, whoa, one at a time! - Away with you! Today we shall only be here for a moment. We must greet each other, - - and you must take home a form and some papers. There is the principal. Stand up straight. Thanks. Be seated. Today is a big day, both for you children... Uncle Anders! There is Uncle Anders! Sorry, I couldn't figure out all the doors. - Yes, go ahead. - Thank you very much. Please don't disturb me... I'm a bit confused at the moment. I sit here and... (the children laugh) As I said, today is a big day, - - both for you children and for your parents. I will now call you out one by one. We didn't get much wiser from that, did we, Uncle Anders? Nah, true, true... I neither learned to read nor to write. It's coming. How do you think little Sis is doing? I don't know, but you can run ahead and see. - Uncle Anders! - What is it? Come and see! All windows and doors are open! Whoa! Something must have gone wrong! Ouch darn! It was Mrs. Sejersen, after all. Yes, whoa, whoa! Does one dare to go in there? - Well, yes, she can't eat us. - No, it is correct. Come. Sorry, I didn't see you. Come on in though! Yes, go ahead. Yes, finally go in... It was bad. - You can see I'm in full swing. - With what? By cleaning the whole house, of course! - It was clean here! - Yes. Yes. But a homely hand is missing here, and you notice that immediately. - Where is Sis? - Up in his bed. I have bandaged her foot. - Porridge? - Yes, exactly. Come on, Per. Whoa, my little friend, you're staying here. You can run to the shopkeeper. Just ask for what's on the note and then run away. Goodbye! Whoa, Whoa. Where Are You Going? I'm going out. Just walk in, You can believe it's blown through! Drafts? What does he mean by that? It's probably just his usual nonsense. Darn! Come closer, Uncle Anders. Here I sit and don't have a word to say. Why did you ask her to come in here? I didn't do that either, she came herself. To borrow something. Then you don't have to say more, then I can see it all for myself. (car honks) It must be Peter. I called him so he could look at my foot. Aah, it's him the student! Yes, he is studying to be a doctor. Good day, Sis. I came as fast as I could. - Is it very bad? - It hurts a little... Uncle Anders, I think you said you were busy. With what? Yes, you said you had to hurry home. No, I never said that! Now think carefully, Uncle Anders. Is there something wrong with your eye, my sweet girl? No. Oh, yeah! Now I remember. Yes, I guess I have to go suddenly. - Goodbye. - Bye. Bye. Well, let me see your foot. - No, the sick one. - Well, that's it. That one? Yes, if I wasn't so annoyed with Mrs. Sejersen, - - then it was laughable. She has bandaged the wrong foot. No! Why didn't you say that? I didn't bother. - What's that in your cup? - Oat soup. That should probably help. - Well, does it hurt here? - No, on the contrary. - Here? - Ouch! Yes, a little bit. It is not sprained. Fortunately. - That was nice. - What a sweet little foot you have, Sis. Then you just had to watch the other one... without bandage! Besides, I've got a student. Someone who is going to sit for the student exam. Do you have that? The father is very rich, so it doesn't matter what it costs. And it is one that requires many hours. Then it will be a lot of money. And then the two of us are going out dancing one evening! Here you go, Little Per, there's a piece of sugar for your dog. - Thank you very much, but I don't have a dog. - What? Isn't that your dog? Nah, it's just someone who followed me. Here you go, here is a piece of sugar. Do you understand what I am saying? Can you go home with you? You mustn't run after me like that. Go home with you, little dog, when I say so! No, you must not come in here! Nah! Now, listen! But Per! But what kind of ugly animal is that? It's not ugly, aren't you? Don't worry about that! It growls! Aah, how sweet it is! Such one is good at catching rats. We must have absolutely no rats! Will you immediately let that animal out! - Well, it likes me. - Come on, we'll go in and play with it. Yes, come, we're going into the living room. How funny it is! - I guess it's pretty good! - Yes. I just finished the floor! Out with it, says… - Aah, Mrs. Sejersen! - Sorry, I didn't see you. - God, was it you! - I guess I can't get around that. Father, Mrs. Sejersen wants to throw the dog out! Shouldn't we keep it? It has followed Per home. It is so cute! Such a dog does a lot of filthyness. And we can't have that! We? Yes, Mrs. Sejersen, after all, it is not you, but us, who live here. Yes, sorry for helping! But I can go to myself. Well, Mrs. Sejersen! Don't get me wrong, we are very grateful for your help! Yes, I can tell! Well, Mrs. Sejersen... Mrs Sejersen! Well, she must have been angry. - Serves her right! - Yes, that is now true though! - We can't keep that dog. - Well, it likes being here! We must remember that there may be someone who misses it. - Put it outside the garden gate. - Aah no, father! Come here with it. Then I can do it myself. Bah! So, so, yes, yes... Come on... Can you come home with you then! Go on! (the dog barks and howls outside) Doggie, will you shut up! You wake up the whole house. Wait a minute, I'll come down to you. Oh! Come on, little puppy... Are you freezing? Don't you have anywhere to sleep? Do not be afraid. They are all sleeping together. Come up here and I'll carry you. So you can lie here and sleep tonight? (the dog barks) Shhh! - Good morning, little Sis. - Good morning, darling. - You could sleep a little longer. - No, thanks. - Listen... Where are you going? - nowhere, little Sis. What? Where has it gone? Per! Well, Per! Per! Per! Per? Yes, little daddy? What's this about? I think it's a dog. So, so, not sassy! That's enough! You bring the dog back where it belongs. Isn't that the address on the necklace? Yes, it says number thirteen. It's right here in the long, red house. Good, then you can turn it back on the way to school. - Yes, little daddy. - Here you go. So, what is it? Can you then go back to Per! There. Don't be sad, doggie. Now who is it that comes running... - What will you? - It's your dog. Well, that's it! Damn dog, come here! What is it now? If you don't like the dog, can I have it? Aarh, screw you, go away kid! Oh? You're not afraid, are you? - Yeah. - What's the matter? - Don't you want to sell doggy? - Doggie! Do you have any money? Nah. That's the best thing I've heard! Bring a hundred crowns and we can talk about it. (the dog barks) Shame! - What's wrong? - There was a nasty man. - What did he say? - He freaked out. - Well? - But he wants to sell doggy. Will he? What does it cost? - One hundred crowns. - A hundred crowns? Are you sore, man! Come on, or we'll get into trouble. Today we will hear about the Danish domestic animals. - Anni, what kind of animal is that? - It's a pussycat. - Yes. And the three little ones? - They are kittens. Yes, right. Per? - Per, you're not listening! - Yes. Yes. No, you do not! What do you do? I think. Stop it and listen! Can you tell me what kind of animal it is? Don't you even know that? Phew! You are really sassy, Per! Can you then enter the corner of shame! Well, it's busy. - Quiet! Then go outside the door. - Yes. It is well done... (a man coughs) Then we all close our atlas! Today we are going to look at France... May I then ask for some peace! If it pleases them ladies and gentlemen. Thanks. We all know that the capital is called Paris, - - but there are also many other big cities. - Ding, ding! - Stop it! Shut up, Mie! We can't have that disruption here. What is the name of the big port there? May I hear? Torben? - Le Havre. - Radiant. It is called "Le Havre" with a silent "h" and is located in northern France, - - but otherwise it was excellent, thank you. What is it called? Ole? He just has to chew on it. Marseilles. Right. And what is the name of the small island two kilometers away? - It's called If. - Amazing! And can you tell me why that island has become famous? Because the Count of Monte Cristo fled from there. He was sitting in a miserable dungeon and had done nothing! Suddenly, a dark winter's night, when the storm raged, - - died the old long-bearded one next to him. - and then he saw the chance: He wanted revenge... Ouch! Yes, yes, thank you, thank you! You don't have to explain the whole novel to us, we've already heard about it. (Mie screams) Mie, there is the door! I have warned you, young lady. Get lost! It is well done. - Per! - Yes, what is it? - Are you put outside the door? - Yes. - Aren't you ashamed? - Nah. Do you? Well, Sis, it was grossly unfair. Torben lifted her by the braids, and then she was thrown outside the door! He's moronic, that teacher! Our teacher isn't really smart either. Oh? She asks and asks: "What kind of animal is that?" she says, and then it was a cow! Well, it's because you have to learn it. - We all knew that. - Yes, that's good, my dear. You must not sit there on the table at all. Go into the living room and talk to Uncle Anders until the food is ready. - Can it stay here that long? - Yes. Yes. - How late father is coming today. - Yes, it's strange. - It doesn't look like him at all. - Nah. - Well done, Uncle Anders! - Well done! Anyone can come and say that. - Shall we play a smart one for you? - It is completely new! Yes, excellent... Uncle Anders? Can you lend me a hundred crowns? One hundred crowns! But what are you going to use them for? - I just stand there missing them. - Nah, unfortunately I can't. - Per, come here! - One hundred crowns... Now I am ready. Well done, children! Well, are you there, little daddy? Yes. Tell Uncle Anders, I want to talk to him. Yes. Uncle Anders? Father has come now. He wants to talk to you. I was going to ask you to come up to him. Oh, well, well ... Well, I'll go up there. Hear, can I see your hands? Have you played the piano with those hands? Get up and wash yourself! Per, can I see yours? No need, I go willingly. - Mie, we are setting the table. - Yes. - I need to talk to you. - Is something wrong, old friend? - I have been fired. - That's not true! And you, who have been there in the company for so many years! Yes, almost twenty. - Well, what happened? - You know, the company has been sold. And the new owner only wants young people, says the personnel manager. Oh? Does he say that? It's well done! And you, who are such a skilled bookkeeper. Did it happen today? No, several months ago. I have until the first of January. Have you said anything to the children? No, I always thought it was all right, - - but today I was told that someone else has got the position. Then the food is on the table. Listen, what's the matter? you look so festive. - You see, little Sis, your father has... - No, Anders! Now let's go down and eat first, then we can talk about it afterwards. Yes, as you wish. - Ih, what a pity it is for father! - It's a shame for us too! Couldn't we get him married to a rich lady? Are you really smart, man? He is much too old. And we shall have no stepmother. No, thank you! Aarh, yes, it was just a suggestion. Now I have it! Couldn't we go up and talk to the new director? - How full of good ideas you are. - Yes, they're not that crazy at all. Sis said that now we have to save. We have to turn every five cents. What a hassle! - Sorry. - Yes? - How much? - What have you? - What does it cost? - What? - The room. - Well! Eighty... Seventy-five. - Fine, I'll take that. - Well, you haven't seen it. Nah, but I've seen you. Shame I don't include in the rent. Here you go. I guess I must draw your attention to the fact that it is up on the twig. - Magnificent! - Here you go. It's not very big. We usually use it for a pantry. It is probably also excellent for that. And you have to share the bathroom with the rest of us. It's just so nice. In winter, it may be a little cold here. But in return for the summer... - Then it's suffocatingly hot! - Yes. - Are you sorry about that? - No, I love heat. Yes, and so we have three children. - Are they married? - No, it's my siblings. Oh! I thought... - So they make quite a lot of noise. - It does not matter. I love noise. Yes, and then there is a skylight. Well, the view is wonderful! - Can I move in tomorrow? - Do you really want it? Yes, I really want to. Well, I'd better get going. - Are you going to mason? - Exactly. I thought so. You have to pay for that, Mie! Principal! Torben! What is that? It's a nigger kiss. I asked you to stay up here during recess to talk to you. It's a boring occasion. Recently, money has disappeared from the overcoat out in the hallway. As recently as yesterday, a ten crown note was taken - - from a coat outside here. It could be an outsider, - - but unfortunately there are many indications that it is a student. Therefore I say to you, just as in the other classes, - - if it is one of you, then volunteer to me. Yes, then there is no more. Then you can run down. Why aren't you down? Why aren't you down to play with your mates? - They are so small. - So are you. Not so small! Watch what you have in your pockets, boys, Mie is coming! What do you mean by that? She was the only one outside the door yesterday. You should report yourself to the principal. - Me? Do you mean me? - Yes, why not! That's enough! - Ole! - Is that you, Mie? No, it is not! Don't be sad, little Mie! Yes! I don't want to be here anymore! I want to go home! What is going on here? - We're just playing. - It didn't look like that. Now look to come down with you. You must not be up here at all. Mrs. Sejersen, haven't you seen Sis? She is not home. Nah, I don't have that. Well, what's the matter, Mie? Are you sick? No, but I was accused of taking some money from school. No! Well, it was terrible! Now you mustn't cry. If you really came to take that money, - - said it openly and honestly and lives them back, right? They also think I could do something like that! Well, Mie though! No... Mie! Wait a minute! Come over here. What's wrong? Some money has gone missing at school, - - and they all think it's me who took them. - And then you ran home? - Yes. It was completely wrong. When you haven't done anything, you shouldn't run away either, right? - I haven't taken them! - No, of course you don't. Hop on the back and I'll drive you back. The class has probably started now. - What do you have? - Gymnastics. Then you can easily slip in. Hold tight, Mie. It is well done... - Listen, what are you doing here? - I have to go in and talk to the principal. - Has he sent for you? - No. - Have you been naughty? - Nah. You can't disturb him in the middle of school-time. Get off with you. - What are you about to do? - In and talk to the principal. - Have you done something wrong? - Nah. Then you can't talk to the principal now. Disappear with you. Greetings, Mr. Count! Are you also going to the teacher's meeting? - Nah. - What are you going to see? In and talk to the principal. Yes, it is absolutely right. Goodbye! high on a branch a crow simsalabim bamba saladu saladim high on a branch a crow sat then came a hideous hunter simsalabim bamba saladu saladim then a hideous hunter came he shot the poor crow simsalabim bamba... Nah, that's really too wrong! Who is making such a fuss? It is me. Do you want to come in here, and at once! Yes, please. Well, I have to ask: What is the point? Yes, I want to talk to you. Nah, you're wrong, young man. I am the one who wants to talk to you. Well, then we both want to talk to each other. Oh, yeah... Let it be heard. Now if I tell you who it is that goes around stealing money, - - what happens to him then? - Happening? Yes, he should be expelled. - Yes. But I think he gets off with a serious warning. Then I would like to say it. It's Torben from the 2nd middle. - Torben? - Yes. I saw it myself. He is the one with the blue eye. - A blue eye? Are you sure? - Yes, because I gave it to him myself. I must say... - So, Mie! - It does not matter. It's good, she's regained her sense of humor. So I should have heard Ole sing! I guess I can't go because my voice is in transition! It sounded like a cow mooing! Muh! Muh! Muhhh! Well, Per though! Do you sit and dip your own spoon into the bowl? Well, little Sis, I licked it clean first. (dog barks outside) Per! You don't leave the table when you eat. I thought it was doggy, but it weren't. (the doorbell rings) Ih, you big Chinese! I completely forgot to mention that I have rented out the utility room. Seventy-five crowns a month. Oh? That sounds good. Who is it for? Think, I don't know his name. But he is a bricklayer. Father, you must go out and receive him. A bricklayer? Let's go out and see the giraffe! Come on, friends! - Good day. - Good day, my name is Erik Holm. - Welcome. - Thanks. May I be allowed to put it in here? I have quite a lot of luggage. - Well, you have the drawing board with you. - Yes, I'm studying to be an architect. - Aw, then you're not even bricklayers! - No, not really. It's Ole, Mie and Per. We will help you up with the suitcases. Here you go, it's all right up there. - Here you go. - Thanks. - And out with you! - We never have to do anything either. Out! That I must say! A little fairy must have been here and cast a spell. I'm happy if you like it. If there is anything you want, just call. Yes, please. It sounds promising. Can I join? Yes, go ahead. - It must have been beautiful! - Go over and pick it up. We can't do that, they're away on a trip. The gate is probably locked. So what? We then just climb over the wall. - He's a coward, he doesn't dare. - Well, I'll go then. Do you know what? I got a hole in my pants. You shouldn't be sad about that. I have a safety pin. - Ouch! - Shouldn't we play a little here? - No. Said now, they're back. - They are not. There you can see for yourself. There are shutters for the windows. - Are you really smart! - It's the burglar alarm! Look there! There's someone in there! - Lets go! - Take me with you! Come on! Stop the thieves! - Stop the thieves! - Let go of me, boy! Come on! It was just a matter of hanging a hair, huh? - Yes. Did we get it all? - Yes. The jewelery and the silvery. But there were papers inside the box, which were perhaps more valuable than everything else. Damn it! Now it's getting red! Help! The police! Hide him! Come on, brother. But no numbers, right? No. - Where are we going? Are we going far? - Well, you'd like to know that, wouldn't you? Yes, thank you, because we eat at six. Is it good to be a thief? Thieves? It's a shame we're not thieves. We are... ... game collectors. You won't hurt me, will you? What the hell are we doing with the boy? We could put him in a sack and throw him in a lake. Oh, no! I can not swim. Do not be afraid. We drop him off outside the city in an empty place by the country road. All right. If you say a word to anyone, we'll come and cut your ears off. - Did you understand? - Yes. - Can you find home now? - Yes, I think so. What is that? - Now that was a funny little guy. - Yes, nice boy. He could easily have cost us each six years. - Listen, where's the folder? - You took it. Me? It was you who took it! No, I put it in for you, so it must be there. You, he's the one who snatched the folder! - The accursed youth! - Turn the cart around! Oops! Where the hell did he go? If I get hold of him, I will strangle him. - Bless you! - Thanks. - Why do you say bless you, anyway? - You are sneezing? - No! - Yes, it wasn't me. Then it is him, the little slave. There he runs! There he is! Has the clock gone that many? I have to get back to the office. And these two men who pulled you into the car, what did they look like? The one he was nice. - Well, what did he look like? - He looked nice. - Well. And then the other? - He didn't look that nice. Yes, yes, little friend, it's more their looks now, I mean. Oh! One he was tall, and the other he was not so tall. But he was nice. It won't be easy to catch them after that description. It will be quite difficult. They drove by the way in a Citroen 48 with front-wheel drive. K 113 973. - What? - Yes, K 113 973. Well, almighty! Why didn't you say that before? After all, no one is asking. Well, no... Let's get it out to all the wagons at once. - Lyngby police here... - You are nice. Have you seen? Yeah, isn't it funny? Come on in. Come in, Uncle Anders. You can believe I'm proud of my boy. - I can understand that! - I got all the afternoon papers. Yes, it's also there. May I greet today's man? Now you are famous, and then you get five hundred crowns on top of! Then I can buy five doggies! One is enough. The rest of the money must be in the bank. Dad? Shouldn't I make a little cup of coffee? - Yes, that was a good idea. - Come and help me, Peter. Uncle Anders, sat you down on the sofa. Now what is that? Don't you want to take your hat off? Did I forget the layer... Hovering flies in scout camp... You, Sis? You don't have to calculate anything for me. Why not? I'm sorry, but I have to be with my student at four thirty. Oh, no! On a Saturday afternoon? Yes, it's a shame, but... Is everything going well with him? It's not a him. Isn't that someone him? So is it a girl? Oh... Why didn't you tell me before? - Because you always get so jealous. - Do I? What nonsense! I never get jealous! How old is she? She must be over eighteen. She drives her own carriage. Oh, she has a carriage! Does she look good? I haven't thought about that, though. - What is her name? - Marianne. Marianne? Sis... Well, you'd better go, otherwise you'll be late. - Aren't you following me out? - Yes, of course! Now I'm going to help you put this on. No thanks, I can do that myself. Here you go. Nah, it's you! Good day! Good day. You probably haven't greeted our new lodger. It's Erik Holm and it's Peter. Mr. Holm is an architect. Oh. Listen, you must hurry. You can't keep her waiting. - Well, yes, but goodbye. - Bye. Bye. You can sit on the back of my motorcycle if you are going to town. - Thank you very much, but I won't. - Well. - So you don't want to go? - No, thanks. Well... - Well, goodbye then! - Goodbye. - Would you like a cigarette? - No thanks, I don't smoke. Otherwise, I had intended to go for a short walk. It's such gorgeous weather today. I can't lure you in? Unfortunately, it doesn't work. I have to make coffee for the family. But maybe another time. (cycle gasses up) What, are you there again? Yes, and I would like to buy doggy. It is good! So where are the hundred crowns? Here! Now I never have... Well, why not? Bring the note. Here you have that coot. Whoa, whoa! You have to be good to the animals. And then let me be free to see you more. You can believe, little doggy, you'll be fine. What's your name? That's enough! I just forgot to ask... What is it called? Aarh, screw off, young one! J-E says Je, N, says "n," Jen, S says "s," E says "e." Come on, Jensen! That people can't see! - Well, it's Sis! - Who? Did you beat yourself up, Sis? Uh, no! I think it's great to be hurled across the pavement! - Now I have to help you. - Thanks, it's not necessary. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You teach, I see. - Well, yes... So it's Marianne. - Well. Good day. It's Sis, I think. Peter has told me so much about you. Oh. Has he? - Now I have to follow you home, Sis. - No thanks, it's not necessary. I can handle myself. Goodbye, and thanks for the help. Oh, I pray, it was so little. Peter, I guess she didn't really like me. Sis is good enough... She forgot her head! Sis! Sis! Our Lord preserved. Well, Anders, are you here? Do you understand, I felt like picking you up from the office, - - because I want to talk to you so much. Shall we go to the little café here? Yeah, let's do it. - Cheers, my friend. - Cheers. Well, so there is nothing new? No vacancies? Yes, there are many, but only for young people. Listen here: "Accountant: Young man with business degree wanted. Bookkeeper, not over thirty-five years old, wanted for a managerial position." It's like that all the way through. You don't have many chances when you're over fifty. - Have you spoken to the personnel manager? - Naturally. That's a very superior guy. Nah, there's nothing to do. Now don't lose heart, there is still over a month until the first of January. Yes, but the deadline is the eleventh of December. Nah, I'll have to sell the house. No, you must not do that! What do you think the children will say? I don't know where we're going to move either. - If only I could help you. - Don't think about that, Anders. I'm just sad for Sis and the kids. It's going to be a sad Christmas, I'm afraid. It's snowing! Jensen, it's snowing! Sis, it's snowing! - It's snowing! - No, is it? - It's snowing, it's snowing! - Well, it doesn't. Well, that's it! You can come and see for yourself. Yes, it does too! Come, let's hurry down! - Are you almost done? - Yes, yes, yes. Stop swallowing though! However, it is a terrible rush job. - We have to go out and fight with snow. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Here you go, Mie. - Goodbye! - Hurry up. Yes, yes, now take it easy. The snow isn't going anywhere. Wait for me! It cannot do that! So... Whoa, shouldn't I have a morning kiss? Goodbye. - Hurry up. - Yes. Yes. I will come after you! Ih, where are you going to get! I will give you! Principal! But shut up with that howling. One can't stand listening to it. And then you make a slide right here in the middle of the pavement. That you aren't be ashamed! You are too big for that. Yes! Kids! - Ih, how mad she was! - Yes! Ole, Mie and Per! We have to eat! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Whee! Why do we have to eat already? Because I'm invited out. I'm going out dancing. - With Peter? - Exactly. Aah, if only it was me! - What nonsense. - So, Per! Why haven't you said anything about it? Because it's been so long since he invited me. Listen, can't I go in and take the clothes off? Uncle Anders will come in a little while. Off with you. Can't we just go out and play for ten minutes? - No. - When are you leaving? He comes to pick me up at exactly eight. - Then we don't need to eat now. - Yes, because I have to decorate. I have made myself a new dress. Bugger! You'd think if I were 40 years younger I'd go out and swing you! You're cute, Uncle Anders. Yes, I am... Many have said so. Yes, I could tell a lot of things... - Well, you shouldn't. - No, I can see that. Why doesn't she call him? You don't understand that. She is far too proud for that. If Peter has forgotten it, it is the worst for himself. - Tell me, are we playing or are we yammering? - We play. (car honks) There he is! where is my bag? It's here, Sis. Take care, my girl. Goodbye, little daddy! Goodbye, Uncle Anders! Goodbye, kids! Goodbye! Yes, now I'm coming. - Here I am. - Good evening. Aah, I thought it was for me. - I just had to pick up Erik Holm. - Well... Hello, Kalle. Go straight to the others. Say, I'll be there in a moment. Fine. What a lovely dress you are wearing. Are you also going out tonight? Nah. Is there something wrong? Is that him, Peter? - Has he stood you up? - Yes. Listen, we have to do something about that. - They are going out with us tonight. - No. Yes! He really enjoys that. - I can't do that. - Of course you can. The carriage holds at the door, and it is filled with a lot of sweet people. And we just need a lady. A sweet lady. Cheer up! We'll probably make an evening out of it. There they went. It's not him at all! - It's the bricklayer! - Let's see! - Yes, it is too. - Yes, he is red-haired. - Whoa, what is this? - I don't understand a damn thing either. (phone rings) - Mie, do you want to take it? I bet it's Peter. Hello? Nah, is that you, Peter? What will you? Sis? Well, she's not at home. What do you say? Had you forgotten? Nah, she's out with the wall... with the architect. Yes, they were supposed to go out dancing. Is there any message? Well, not? Goodbye. So, now he was insulted. - Who? - Peter, of course. - He's jealous! - That they want to... - Shouldn't we go and play ludo then? - Yeah. I begin. Then it's my turn. One, two, Three. Then it's my turn! I thought I had a lot more in my Christmas pig. I did too. I have just two crowns and eighteen ears. It's the smallest I've had yet. - It's called "the smallest." - Well. - What shall we give father? - A meerschaum pipe! - Nonsense, man! He has one like that. - Well, he hasn't. Well, he has. No, because I broke it yesterday. Well, Per though! Such a thing is expensive, and you know that money is tight. - Won't we get a Christmas tree? - Yes, we're going, but only a little one. So it doesn't even go from the floor. Listen now, little man, if you want to see big trees, - - then we can just go to the Christmas exhibition. We have nothing to buy for. No, not very much, but we can take a look. (the doorbell rings) - Ole, do you want to open the door? - It is not necessary. Sis is down there. - Good day. - Good day. Peter is not here. Peter? Too bad he's not the one I've come to talk to. - Well? Go ahead to get inside. - Thanks. Well, I haven't seen him for a long time. Oh? I have given up on that exam. It didn't make sense to me. Well then, I don't understand... I have come to abduct my cousin. - Who? - Erik Holm. Doesn't he live here? Yes. No, think that he is your cousin. Yes, the world is small, isn't it? It's straight up the stairs, second door on the right. Shall I go up and show it? No thanks, it's not necessary. I can easily find it. Forty-five, eighty-five. Yes, hello, can I meet Peter Mortensen? Oh... And you don't know when he will come? Well. Nah, then there was nothing. Goodbye. No, how beautiful it is here! - Come and see! - Yes, what is it? If only we could buy such a cradle! That is the only thing Sis wants. - Well, we can't. - No, because we have no money. A mouse! Listen, where is Per? There he is, the party original. Per though! Are you really smart? Whoa, Ole, Mie, Little Per! Come over here! Howdy! It must have been fun meeting you here. What a lot of packages you have! Yes, the whole family comes on Christmas Eve. Sit down and have a cup of chocolate. Yes, thank you, we would really like to, but... - So we can't afford that. - Because we have to save. Yes, because our father has been laid off. Sit down anyway. We give. Thanks. Hey, miss! Five chocolates. And what do we need for it? - Birthday cake! - But of course. Five pieces. - Now what is your father? - He is a bookkeeper. Maybe our father could use him. He just bought a new company. Yes, a large seed company. Down by Old Beach. - Is it l.S. Berg and Co.? - Yes, that's exactly what it is. Come, Mie and Per. We walk! - No! - Yes, we're going. Whoa, what's up? You can't go like that! What have we done to you? It is your father who has thrown our father out! - It is impossible! - No, it's not, and now we're going! - So I can't understand that. - Nah, it doesn't look like the old one. - Now if he really did it? - Then he must deal with us. We go up to the office. Now, immediately! Yes. - Here you go. - Thanks. The director's children is here and wants to talk to you. I have no time now. They must wait. If the director just wants to see here? (there's a knock on the door) Yes? Was it you? Didn't you hear I'm busy? I'm sitting here in an important conference with the HR manager. - You don't have to speak so loudly, father. - We can hear what you are saying. But this matter is important. - We have always admired you. - Thank you very much. We don't do that anymore. Oh? Can the reason be known? Yes. You probably remember Ole, Mie and Little Per. Clearly. Their father is the chief accountant and is employed here. - Yeah. - Or rather was! - Yes, because you fired him. - Have I? Yes, and you can't be familiar with that. Listen, do you know anything about that case? Yes, that's right. He must quit on the first of January. - How long has he been here? - Probably for eighteen years. But the man is over fifty, - - and the director likes young people best. Yes, when we hire new ones! But we do not dismiss old, good employees! Well done, Dad! So, so, so. Well, otherwise I have engaged a young man of twenty-eight. - Very skilled... - And who is it? - Yes, it is my nephew. - Yes. Then I understand everything better. Will you arrange it with your nephew, - - and then inform the other that he can keep his position. - No, father, it must be done properly. - You have to tell him that yourself. Listen, I shouldn't exactly ask him to stay should I? Well, thank you. Because he is such a nice and modest man. It would stiffen him mightily if you say the company can't do without him. Yes. Yes. Surely there's nothing else you want to get sorted out here while we're at it? No, thanks. That was all. Thank God. - Then run away! - Goodbye, Dad. - You're awesome anyway, dad! - That's just what you are! - Listen, Per, those little ones got too big. - Then we just make them smaller. Listen, it was messed up. The two of us share it, Jensen. No, Per, it won't come to anything that way. They have to be eaten anyway. (the doorbell rings) Now I have to! - Good day, Uncle Anders! - Good morning, Little Peter. - It was Uncle Anders. - Good day, little Sis. - Aah, how cold it is out there! - I'm so busy, so busy. I just wanted to look in, - - because I think you've looked a little sad lately. Life is not easy. Is it with your father, or is it something with love? The last thing, Uncle Anders. A disappointed heart is like a ship without a rudder, - - who are thrown around helplessly in the sea of ​​life - - and finally consumed by the flames of love. Oh my god then... You know what? I also think it smells a bit burnt here! - The little ones! - Yes, indeed! - Oh no! Now look at my little ones. - It was a shame. (the doorbell rings) - Who is it? Anders, my old friend! Wish me congratulations! - Has something happened? - Yes, you can believe that there is! Call Sis and the children into the living room, and I will tell you all about it. Sis! What happened, dad? Children, I've got my position back. Hooray! The director came in person and asked me to stay. He said I was indispensable. There you can see! I knew it would happen! It's the kind that gives confidence. How good it was, father. Look, I've brought home a goose. Tomorrow we will have a really nice Christmas Eve. Well, father, then we won't have to settle for a small Christmas tree. No, you go out and buy the biggest one you can find. Well, it's inside the City hall square. It doesn't have to be that big either! Come! - Here is one. - No, that is much bigger. - Yes, it's good! - We must first ask what it costs. Now I have to. Excuse me, how much is that tree over there? - Hello, Mie. - Nah, is that you, Peter? - It's been a long time, huh? - Why do we never see you again? I don't think Sis is that interested. Well, she is, Peter. She strolls and is really upset. What about the architect? The mason? He's just nice, it doesn't mean anything. - Are you sure? - Swear! And now you just have to listen! I got a good idea... - Mie! - Yes, now I'm coming. - Then we have an agreement. - Then we say it. - You were a long time coming, little Mie. - Yes, we have bought the tree. - Look, I bought a pixie! - How sweet it is! Yes, it looks like a real elf. Wrong, man! There are no goblins. Well, that's how it goes! Don't you also believe in goblins, Uncle Anders? Yes, I have known many goblins in my life! How many the clock strikes thirteen - time passes Guess my little friend where we are going now. to the Christmas ball to the Christmas ball in goblin land put on the gloves and we're off no, wait a minute, you funny little elf I must have the elephant with on all roads flows the happy goblin flock I think I'm dreaming, no, it's real enough tonight we're going to the Christmas-Christmas-Christmas-Christmas Yule Ball there is a feast in the goblin king's hall here is rise porridge from a dish, just eat - lovely food put a dab of butter on your spoon, sprinkle with Christmas snow to the Christmas Ball to the Christmas Ball in Goblinland ih you mild now they dance ballet I do the trick as well as any elf can if I wanted to, I would fly just as easily we dance all night and do hurlum cheers we blow on the cat and it runs away play music for christmas-christmas-christmas-christmas melodrama the pixie hat fits perfectly there are some who don't want to believe there are gnomes hear what I tell them when I get home last night I went to the Christmas ball in goblin land aah we made a lot of Santa fun it is so beautiful in the king's castle in goblin land I have trotted a mile from road to road I have the best friends among the little goblins tomorrow I will probably leave again for the Christmas ball for Christmas-Christmas-Christmas-Christmas Yule Ball there is a party in the goblin king's hall Hooray, hooray, hooray! - What is it? - today is the 24th of December! - Wake up, man! - What's wrong? - It's tonight, it's Christmas Eve! - Yahoo! Christmas Eve and how sweet you are, all the people must be happy Sis, where should I put these two? They would like to be tempered. Sis, have you remembered the almond gift? Yes, it is inside the buffet. And hurry to set the table. Is there anything I can help you with? Yes, you can peel potatoes. Sis, a button has gone in my shirt. Let Mie sew it in. Sis, I forgot where I put the present for you. - Inside in Bornholmer Clock. - Well, yes, for the sake! - You haven't looked, have you? - What? No no. How is it that you are always so late on Christmas Eve? You always are. (the doorbell rings) - Should I? - No, let father. No, Mrs. Sejersen! It was a surprise, come inside. However, I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas. Thanks, and the same to you. I have a little gift for each of the children. It's just a small trifle, but maybe you want to put them under the tree? No, you have to do that yourself, Mrs. Sejersen. - Here you go, it's in here. - Thanks. Nah! How beautiful it is, and so big! That's how the children want it: With peppercorns in the baskets and all. Where are you going tonight? I'm alone, because I'm just myself. Listen, we can't have that. Now take your clothes and stay here with us. - What will Ms. Sis say to that, though? - She will only be happy about that. Also if you want to help her a little. She is currently flitting around like a fly in a bottle. Then I say thank you. I honestly would like to. - Here you go, we can go this way. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Would you be so kind as to put it under the tree? - Uh, thanks! I would like that. - And Merry Christmas. Thanks. Are they going out themselves? Yes, I'm going to celebrate Christmas at my uncle's. - And my cousin. - Well, well! It looks fine, Mie, but you've covered one too many. - No, I have not. - Yes! - No! - There are seven of us. You've covered for eight. - I'm expecting a guest. - What do you do? - Yes. - Now? Yes! (the doorbell rings) Come. - Here you go. - Is it for me? Yes. Don't you want to see what's in it? - Now? - Yes. A muff! No, how sweet it is! Thank you, Peter. Come on, children! Hurry to get the coats on everyone. Such, such... - Well, good evening, Peter! - Good evening. - Listen, don't you want to come? - Yes, thank you, I would like that. - If that means Sis is going along. - Yes, of course Sis must join. Yes, it was just missing! I'll probably take care of the goose. Thank you, that was kind of you. Bye for now. Goodbye! Mrs. Sejersen, do you want to take Jensen? Because it must not come with us. - Mie, I just want to say Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Torben. There's Kjeld and Hanne! - It's the director. - So... It's Jensen. It's Jensen... high from the Green Tree Top radiates the Christmas sparkle fiddler play merrily up now the dance begins now just put your hand in mine don't touch at that raisin first the tree must be displayed then it must be eaten --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
