BEFORE EVENING Listen to what happened in our town no later than yesterday. A small fact, you might say, as could happen to anyone, but that created a sensation, and it has forced many people to think. An odd fact, whose real protagonist is something mysterious that nobody knows: time. Who knows what is time. Who knows what is time, raise a hand. Nobody... Nobody knows. And he continues imperturbable and precisely to mark seconds and minutes... the days of our lives, poor men. The fact begins one morning. When the town laboriously starts moving. Like this gentleman, a modest life insurance agent. An ordinary man, like the many you meet on the street. A simple pretext in order to tell what happened. If you stop acting vain early in the morning, and let people sleep, it wouldn't hurt. We know that you're beautiful. Will you let me sleep? I work all day, you know? I don't walk around chatting with people, like you do. When you touch a nerve, he turns on the tap and ... Sleep! What, sleep?! First you wake people up, then you say "sleep"! What have I become, an electric bulb? That turns on and off. See? He is ashamed to hear the truth. If you had a real job, instead of wandering and chatting with people, you wouldn't be ashamed. Is it my fault if people don't want to insure? Is it my fault if they don't give a damn of dying? If they no longer have faith in the future? Did I invent the atomic bomb? Nonsense. People just ask to get rid of the thought of their children with some money. It's you who are not capable. How can you insure people, if you, in ten years of insurance, have not been able to make a small, small policy, but small, to your family? That's just it! I am very healthy, very peaceful, prudent. I unfortunately take care of maintaining home, and I don't want another thought every month. Would you like, poor darling, that an accident happens to me, so you could enjoy the insurance money? But you couldn't. Do you know what they do in India? When a husband dies, they make a pile of wood. They put his wife on it and go! Fire! And she talks about insurance... Oh my god! He takes care of maintaining home... You clown! You think to make me suffer in straits. All our friends go to beach for two months, we go for 15 days, at the most. Here they are... mountains of accounts, bills, promises. Since you take care of everything, you'll go to discuss taxes this morning. You'll go there, my beauty, instead of spending the afternoons playing canasta, or gossiping with your stupid friends. Instead of showing off in your car, you'll go to tax office. Good morning. - I said "good morning". - So what? Does it take an extra charge to be told good morning? What extra charge? I'm working. Even if, in principle, I don't tip, remember that education is included in your salary! - And clean up! - What am I doing? No, in the elevator there are two butts on the ground. And remember that this is a building of respectable people. But look at him... Am I the one who throws butts into the elevator? Did you see what a slap, Mr. Bancani? NEW COBALT BOMB 100 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN HYDROGEN if they lend me one, I know what I'd do with it. Wouldn't I? I would have already placed it. Pardon me. Hey, why don't you leave home in the morning when you're awake? I wish. Who ever wakes up? To wake up you have to sleep. PHARMACY Not you, the pharmacist. Doctor, this gentleman. May I help you? I would like something for the nerves. I don't sleep well at night A sleeping pill? Yes, a sort of sedative. - Do you have a prescription? - No. Give me something, what you want. I'll look right now. - Of course I sell it, but at your age... - But I feel very young. Here it is. Rather mild, but good. Take a couple of tablets after meals. It's more effective. And four or five before bedtime. They almost have the effect of a sleeping pill. They relax. Not now? If you have to work, maybe not, but if you feel agitated... Thanks a lot. You're very kind, miss. Oh, pardon me. Look, this stuff doesn't work. Are you sure you have taken the right doses? Of course. In place of pork rinds, this morning I found - a big mouse like that, asleep. - Asleep? A little sleepy. He ran away immediately. Very strange. Did you get them here? From the pharmacist on duty last night. You're right. They gave you a sedative instead of a poison. If you kept giving it for some days, you'd healed the nerves of the mice, and they took your shop away. Now I understand why it had fallen asleep. Of course. Try this one. If necessary I'll give you the other tomorrow. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you, doctor. Both are pink tablets, they can... The Vasenal... Where is Vasenal bottle? - It was there. - Where?! It was there, I don't know. My goodness! - Miss, where is the Vasenal? - It's here, doctor. Why is it in your hand? What did you do with it? I gave few tablets to a gentleman, and without prescription, I could only give... You give them! My goodness! - How long ago? - Five minutes ago, no more. To whom? What's the name? I don't know. I never saw him before. It's a man with a pale raincoat, a leather bag, and... - in a dark suit. - In a dark suit! If he takes one, he's dead! This is not a sedative, it's curare! Oh my God, curare! But it was in there. We must find him, move! I didn't fill the bottle! It's not my fault. No, it's not your fault, but only you know him. Look for him. Run! If you don't find him, that man is doomed, dead! Do you understand? A dead man! (Hey, mister!) Why? Excuse me, but you are eternal? Again... I don't want to know it. I don't even want to think about it. I have a garage to run. What do you think? Take it easy. Civilized people talk and discuss. What am I doing? You have been wasting my time for three years. Haven't you understood yet? You still don't know? I don't want any insurance. For your information, I'm doing a purely academic speech. Then, since you aren't eternal, you should think about it. Oh, and then one loses his patience... I'm tired of academic speeches. I'm fine as I am. All right? I am eternal. Are you happy? - Yes, eternal... - Why, do you mind? What eternal... come on! I wanna see you the day I think of. The day you think of? And which would it be? - Tell me. - Nothing. Well... And look, if you don't stop, you can't park your Fiat 500 here anymore. Did I ever allowed myself to offend you? You always did. Get insured is a sign of intelligence. Who insure himself is foresighted. It brings him good luck. A conscientious man is already insured. Therefore I would be an idiot, a shallow, an imprudent. Go to he...! Actually, you know what? Maybe I am an idiot, but you'll pay me the bill right now! - You told me you would renew it? - I will not. I don't want to be imprudent anymore. Mr. Gino, it wouldn't be fair to take the radio away for a delay in the last payment. I am not even fair now? Boy, remove the radio of this man. Wait, there are two days to the end of the week. Do me this favour. He's not totally wrong. That man insists with insurance every morning. Do it today, do it tomorrow, even the saints get tired. Get out! Look, I don't wait later than Monday. - Remember. - Monday. Even before. Hey, you. Do you know you can't honk? - Me? - Yes, you. I didn't honk. I slipped. Yes, because when you slip, you can play songs? What does it matter, I just slipped. You never slip? Look how I did it. Yes, you miss the "ta-ta". - Do you accept a settlement? - All right. I wonder if one can live in a country like this, where as soon as someone slips, tac... an officer comes and makes a fine. Wait, I'll tell you right away. Tonight, nine hospitalized, two deaths. This morning? Yes, there was a case of poisoning. A General. By curare? No, mushroom. Are you really sure? Thanks. Nothing. Only a General. At least if we knew that he's dead. He's dead and that's the end of it... I will be ruined for something. Come on, Alberto, calm down. Maybe nothing will happen. There are many combinations. And what would he bought them for? Maybe at this moment he is already dead somewhere. The shop closed. An investigation. A 150 year old firm ruined! Six people completely broke. Excuse me, doctor, but there isn't a prescription. The tablets were given in the advertising bag. He was alone when he bought them. If he dies, he can't talk anymore. Who can find out it was this pharmacy? Do you know how many suicides there are? Do you hear him? The conscience, the professional duty, where do you put them? Maybe the girl found him. She's taking time. That... She ran away. She's dumb. Alberto, we must call the police. We can't go on this way. The clock is ticking. And who is the police, Harry Houdini? If we have no clues, what can they do? - A matter of minutes, seconds. You know. - Have courage, Alberto. Courage, yes. No. I call the morgue now. If he's already dead, I'm very sorry, but why do I have to report it? - I'll go downstairs, mom. - No, sir, you stay there. Daddy honked at us, I hear him. Daddy doesn't honk! Doesn't he come here and get the tax demand? - I'll be late for school. - Don't worry, he'll talk to the teacher. - Ah, you're here. - Yes, I'm here. Did I have to come here? Am I right? Tell me, am I right? Now you're in league with policemen to get me fines? That's funny! He knows that honking is forbidden. There is always a policeman lying in wait, like an Indian. But he still honks. Obviously he gets a fine, and it's my fault! What do you know! My God, mother, hold me still! Is this the meaning of family? Support, quietness... - Rest between the storms of life... - You're telling me! I was quiet in a wealthy family. With your story that you would become general manager of insurance, - you brought me into this hell! - What are you waiting for? I'm tired of hearing you grumbling, only to demand things. When I put the key in the lock every evening, I feel like I'm entering a prison. At least you enter in it, I'm in prison from morning to night! If it weren't for that poor creature... Why don’t we face the facts? Frankly, you'll take our creature and go back to your home, where you feel good and you've got it all, and let me work in peace. Because I don't want to ruin my health anymore. Understand? It's because of you if I don't sleep at night. It's because of you if I, still young, at 40 years... 41! 41... I have to take sleeping pills. If you want to see me wrecked, you're wrong, because I'll live. I'll become a centenarian. I will end up on "Domenica del Corriere". - Francesca, are you finished? - Let's go! Hurry up, it's late! He'll get an education anyway, poor child. Of course he'll get it. He better learn immediately what there is to know about women. Better early than late. Let's go. Shame on you! Change your apron! People then think that we are dirty. - What should I wear, a tailcoat? - Wait, the taxes! Taxes! Taxes, sir! - Francesca, where is the electricity bill? - Let's go, hurry up! Mr. Paolo! The lady said to leave the money for shopping. I'm in a hurry, dear. Here. Mr. Paolo, there is also the electricity bill. Paolo? Dear? You forgot taxes. Look, there is... - Do me the courtesy of cleaning better! - Why? - Because it's dirty there! - Look at that... Why don't you go to live in the hospital? At least it's clean there, as you say. - A man thinks he has a friend, but... - Dad... Quiet! I'm close to someone who helps women to get me fined. - It's not true. - How is not true? Did you hear the horn, yes or no? - Yes. - So? And I'm am so foolish to take him on Sunday trips... And buy him comic books... Radio, to let him hear soccer matches. Very good, this is loyalty between men. And a liar too. I bet that... How many "A" did you take in the last trimester? - Four. - Speak louder! How many? - Four. - Ah, good boy. And how many "D"? Not even a "D", right? Now let's see. The notebooks. And these are the A? Well, not even a D? That's funny. Also cheated by his son. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good morning. Look, I can't understand anything. I found her crying on the street. She says she should make a complaint. - Does she work here? - Yes. Come also you, miss. Maybe you were afraid that we wouldn't call the police? - No, I was upset. - Can you give me a sedative, please? No, it's closed. There is nothing. Close, please! - Thank goodness someone came. - I was just on my way to police station. - But what happened? - This... There is a man, kind of tall, with a dark suit and a pale raincoat, who is walking around the city with death in his pocket and doesn't know it. With death what? With death in his pocket. Do you know a pocket? He's got it there. At any moment he can die and he doesn't even think about it Do something. We must immediately let him know. It's been almost an hour. Maybe it's late. Call the police, please. Good morning. How are you? - Is there anything for me? - Let me see. - How is your sciatica going? - You don't say it! It's hell. - And your insomnia? - I hope it's over. They gave me an effective remedy. They say a couple of pills are enough and "tac", everything is nice and quiet. You too should do a cure. No, that's enough. I almost ruined myself with this junk. And the money. It's not just about health. There are different medicines. You have to be good at choosing. I was like you. I was not good. - Are you selling medicines now? - Hello. No, I'm just saying. I was recommended one few minutes ago, that seems really good. A true panacea. If you come with me around the corner, I offer you a coffee and try it right now. I can't understand how it is possible to have insomnia. Cant' you? It's quite simple. You want to sleep? But you stay awake. Even if you try hard. So if you don't sleep, what do you do? You think. And if you think, what do you think about? Trouble. So, even if you're sleepy, you wake up. It's a closed circle. A trap. Now... Suppose that someone remembers that man. Tell me when you fall asleep? This peasant man of... What it is, a Rolls-Royce? - Good morning, "Cavaliere". - Good morning. Yes, morning and night. Can you believe it? Having to call that moron "Cavaliere". - Bancani! - Cavaliere? Come upstairs, I have to talk to you. - I'll be back soon. - No, right now. I have to go out. See? When he arrives, you can't even take coffee in peace. But... He's angry at me! But now... I'll give him a piece of my mind! Forget about it. Paolo, don't do anything foolish. No, I'll tell him in the face! Who does he thinks he is?! He mistreated me for 10 years. That's enough! Your productivity in the last semester, my dear sir, has been quite insufficient, pretty poor, I would say. - Five or six little policies. - No, 11, Cavaliere. - 11. - Even 12, always insufficient. So you understand, don't you? I have to do my report to the general manager. No, please. You're so human, intelligent... If you do that report, you know... I've been working for 10 years. I'd like to level-up, if possible. Yes, I understand. But not everyone is destined to improve. I'm not arguing. Maybe I'm not very bright, but this critical juncture caught me unawares. These mountains of policies are made by your colleagues, you know. Yes, but you see... I was confident in my method: collective insurance. You know, collective anxiety, collective insurance... Yes, I understand. I'm leaving now. Try me, Cavaliere. You'll see that I too will bring you many policies. Don't do that report. I have a wife and a kid. For God's sake! Keep wife and kids out of this! I have a wife and kids too, but I'll take care of them. Take care of yours and you'll see that everything will be fine. Sure. I'll take care of them. You can go. This is the last time. I'll give you one month. Collective anxiety or not, this table must be filled with policies. Now let me go, please. Thanks. I knew it... My respects. I'll show you what a work I do for you. Did they leave that remittance to you? - Here. 200.000£. - Thanks. I'll take them to the cashier. - How did it go? - As it was supposed to. Very well. I told him in the face. I'm fed up. - And him? - Him... You know he is. He's smart. He changes subject with such skill... If he wanted to understand, he got it. Otherwise... One can’t hound a poor devil who works like I do. - Didn't I do well? - Very well. In fact, I too will go to the one upstairs someday. - I'll show him. - Sure. One must talk. Only animals don't talk. What's that? I'm studying now a new method that I won't give up even if it comes down... You care too much. Yes, it's easy for you. You achieved something. You got your own office. A steady income. You check the other ones. But you go around, in the open air. You may feel life in your hand, like that leather bag. But you make everything hard. Give yourself a break! All you need is a nice walk, some sun, a chat with a friend... And if necessary, a beautiful girl and you'll feel immediately like a new man. Can you imagine it? With my wife's temper, all that's missing is a beautiful girl. I don't exactly mean that, but something that helps you to face life with courage and hope. Life is a good daughter, only frightens who is afraid of it. Yes, words don't matter and the facts... I'll leave you or I'll be late. I've been working on a fat man for a month, today I feel good and "tac", I'm gonna get him. - Good luck. - Thank you. You're a good friend. We should meet a couple of girls someday and have fun together. We'll talk about it tomorrow. CASHIER The police chief authorization will be there in a few minutes. In the meantime, broadcast the dispatch on the radio. It's a matter of life and death for that man. What? You can't? Look for the director immediately. Every minute wasted may be fatal. My God, what a tragedy! We are ruined. Without official orders, they don't broadcast. You can't imagine how many bad jokes people do. - Excuse me. - Come in, Sergeant. - Are there the jeeps with speakers? - Only two, Inspector. - When the dispatch will be broadcast, each of you choose an area and go. - Okay. - Tell Leopoldi to inform newspapers. - Yes, sir. Doctor Belli, write the name of the pharmacy, the address and the remaining information. Even the newspapers... What a scandal! - Doctor Belli? - Yes. - I remember. - What? His name? - Who is he? - A very clear detail. I can swear it. - Speak! What? He had a small ink stain on the right sleeve of his raincoat. Yes, okay... Hello? Who? Put him on right now. They found the Director of the radio. Do you think we need to make a lot of publicity? I'm sure that we'll find him by broadcasting the dispatch. How nice if he was an escaped convict or a dangerous criminal. It's you, Director? Ah, at last. It suits you well. And the shoulders... I've been waiting for you for two months. Yes, but there is a crease here. Look at this. Oh, please. You can't even see it. You certainly are looking fine. - Nice piece of cloth, eh? It's poor stuff. - Poor stuff? Oh, Jesus! This is pure wool. I'll throw or give away this suit in three or four years. Just because you'll get tired of it. Mr. Bancani, you're not fair. - I can guarantee... look... - No, I'll keep it on. - So you can reverse that one. - Let's reverse it. Here. - Only 20,000? - A down payment. The rest in a month. Are you afraid that I'll run away? My word is like cash money, remember. Gosh, it's late! I'm sick and tired of this bloody insurance. What? Are you tired of insurance? More than that, I'm extremely tired. - But if you always said... - I was wrong. Is it forbidden? People don't buy life insurance and they do well. Why should they do that? But this crease... To leave something to family. - In case of accident. - Why should we leave something to family? Let them do it alone. As I did and you did. And the children... What children? They remain children for a while, then they become scoundrels. Yes, but... And why would an accident happen? Are you afraid of that? No, but there are many cases. If you think of all cases of life, you're done. - Have you an insurance? - No. Very good, you're a wise man. - But you make me think... - Don't think of it. Why? It's not obligatory. But if you say these things... No wonder one thinks about it. - You mean that you never thought about insurance before? - Never. - And you thought about it because I... - Yes, you're saying crazy things. Might be a scam, but you're exaggerating. What is right, is right. Got it. Got it, yes. - A method. - What method? Nothing, something I know. We'll talk about it next time. I'll go now. - Damn... - Did you forget something, Mr. Bancani? Of course, I forgot the most important thing: sleep. Sleep is important, isn't it? Let's hope you change your mind about insurance, my friend. What children, what accident! They can go to hell. Never mind them. Gosh, the insurers are very strange. Attention. Please, pay attention to the following dispatch. A man's life is in danger. Around 8:30 a.m. an unknown individual bought at Belli Pharmacy located in via Verdi, 59 a bland sedative. For a fatal mistake he was given 20 tablets of a very powerful poison. One tablet is enough to cause death of any person. Attention. As soon as aware of the dispatch, the person concerned please call or report to the police. He is a man of about 40 years, approximately 5'7 in height. Brown hair, jovial face, friendly. He's wearing a gray suit and he has a small ink stain on the right sleeve of his raincoat. Attention. Ma'am. - What are you doing here? - So you don't know anything? Mother of God! Someone was given poison by mistake and he doesn't know it, poor man. - Radio said it now. - Well? There is a police jeep with the speaker on the street. He is 40 years, with a dark suit! - Yes, but why are you so excited? - Might be Mr. Paolo. It's actually him. He had a dark suit. There are tens of thousands dark suits in this city. But Mr. Paolo had also a stain on the sleeve of his raincoat. I tried so hard to remove it, ma'am. I was never able. He went to pharmacy this morning, I told you. He had to take sleeping pills. And they made a mistake with those pills. He doesn't know it and can die at any moment. Can't you see? Oh my God! Poor Mr. Paolo. He is so good, kind and clean. I wonder where he is now, poor guy. My goodness. General Insurance? Mr. Bancani, please. Immediately. SHOE FACTORY - Good morning. Is the Cavaliere in? - He's busy with some people. It's okay, I'll wait in the shop. - Who shall I say is here? - No matter, tell him I'm a friend. Good morning, baby. How are you? - Oh, it's you, sir? - Yes, it's me. Why? I come to see you to the end of the world and you don't even say hello. Yes, you're here to see the boss, not me. I might see hundreds of people in town more important than your boss, so if I come here it's because I'm glad to see you. You don't know what pleasure you're for the eyes and the spirit. Always cheerful, eh? Things are going well for you. Not bad. Then when I see you, I become someone else. You say that every time, but then... I work, I travel... But I always think of you. - Do you want these? - No, thanks. Don't you like them? You are too kind, sir. Doing you a favour, even a small one, for me it's a joy. Sometimes I think that a beauty like you is wasted in this place. You look like a bird in a cage. Didn't you participate in a beauty contest? Yes, I tried, but it's a great racket. Well... sure. I have a friend in a committee. - If you don't mind, I could talk to him. - Really? If you want, I'll have the photos reprinted. Sure. Anyway you're wasted here. You are a smart girl. Come here, let me look at you. Come on. You can tell by your eyes that you're smart. You would be a perfect secretary. Gosh... With your figure, you could also do the mannequin. You would made a career immediately in the city. You're telling me... I'm sick of this town of vulgar people. Don't talk about it. Why don't you want to talk? It's so good to talk. I would love to talk to someone. You know... the opinion of a woman... But aren't you married, sir? Married... yes. Almost separated. I don't communicate with my wife anymore. In any sense. So, you see... I need to... I'm at a crossroads, my dear. You couldn't even imagine it. Please , Sergeant, take note... Easy, easy! Please... Can we talk to the Inspector? It's very urgent. What the lady is saying is reliable. Everything matches. Can't you do something right away, Inspector? Every minute wasted could cost his life. You're right, but as long as the pharmacy girl doesn't recognize him, our hands are tied. You understand. Hello, Doctor Belli? No, nothing from the morgue. Send immediately the girl here, for the photo identification. Yes, tell her to ask for me. Hello, dear Cavaliere! - Long time no see. - Well... - So the friend was you? - Gee, I've been visiting you for months. If someone cares about your welfare, is not a friend? I'll take care of that. I'm in trouble and I haven't slept for nights. - Goodbye. - No! You don't sleep... Neither do I. Take this. - What's this? - An extraordinary sedative. You'll sleep immediately with this. Take it. I never took anything and I don't want to start now. I'm a bit nervous. If you go away, everything passes. That's why you suffer of insomnia. I thought just like you and I was wrong. Try it, please. It's a panacea. - How I take these? - Water. With a little water. It's easy. You'll swallow them in a second. If they sell them without prescription, they can't hurt. Try it. No. Thanks a lot. I have a personal dislike for medicine. - Well... Just once? - Never. I prefer natural remedies. Have you ever tried to count? Think that one time I passed 10,500, then I had to stop for not be late for work. It went better with requiem. You know, reciting a requiem... Then it's better the candle! Take a candle, put it at the end of the bed and stare at it. Sometimes it works. If you are sleepy. A friend of mine once told me to stay still at bed with your eyes closed, thinking of doing things as if you really have to do them. Cavaliere? It's disgusting, you know? I hate insurance. - I'm fed up. - You are fed up? - What is it? - Mr. Carlini is waiting for half an hour. Let him wait! Can't you see I'm busy? He is busy. - So... - Yes, I'm fed up. If you knew how sad is to realize after 10 years that you wasted a lot of energy in something useless. Come on, it should be useful to something. Maybe it's this juncture. It will pass. But it's useless. You're like me. You work, have trouble. You have shaky hands like mine. Why should I cheat you, Cavaliere? What's the use of insurance? The word itself tells you. To insure. To protect yourself against some accident. Which one? If someone doesn't think of accidents, they don't come. You say so. If someone gets sick? If someone gets hit by a car? - Don't you read the papers? - So what? What do you care when you had an accident? In hell or in paradise, you're fine. Forgive me, but this is a selfish talk. And the children, wife? Please, don't talk about women. They'll make it every time. Children... You know what? - Securing their future, I think it's bad. - What? So they grow inept, spoiled, in poor health. Boys grow well on the street, dirty and barefoot, in rags, but with an open mind, disease-resistant. And with big, intelligent and bright eyes. I don't understand you. What are you saying? It would be better if my son was a beggar? Never mind. I'm tired of always talking about insurance. There is someone waiting for you. I have to go. Goodbye. Eh, no! Wait. Explain to me, first. Did they find him, Inspector? Is he dead? Make way. Let us through. Sergeant, a jeep for the lady and the Cavaliere. Right now. May I, Inspector? Can you tell his last words before he left the office this morning? - Please! - Are you his office manager? - Yes. Have some compassion. The lady feels bad. Was he a good insurer? The best of my employees. Active. Meticulous. But leave us alone now. Issue a press release: a gray Fiat 500, dark sunroof, radio antenna, license number Roma 73479. I've done it! Come here. - Done what? - Everything. Come here. Gee... - What is it now? - You are phenomenal. Come on, don't talk nonsense, sir. Why, you make yourself pretty and show these wonders, and you don't want me to talk. Who can keep his mouth shut? - What did you say before? What have you done? - Oh, yes. I won. You're not only beautiful, you bring good luck. Do you remember the fat man who didn't want to buy insurance? Your boss. I sold him a stunning policy to a sum that I didn't reach for three years. - I'm glad. - This is nothing. What matters is that the method works. Don't insure people, get you insured by them. My dear, you have the honor of speaking with a future general manager. - Did you become general manager? - No, but I'm on the way. And what a way. What do you think? Sure, you're very good. I'm glad. That's life: nature, beauty, success, sun. How long I didn't even notice the sun. - Did it rain a lot in the city? - No, I was so stupid not to see the sun. ♪ That small bunch of flowers ♪ ♪ That comes from the mountain ♪ ♪ And take care not to wet it... ♪ A life insurance agent is the man with the death in his pocket ... insurer is still alive, the most dangerous moment is now, because if he'll follow the advice of the girl who sold him the poison, he will take the tablets after lunch. - I knew it! - Calm down. In what state they'll find him, poor man. Quiet, here he comes. Darling! Mother's darling. Why are you crying, Francesca? Why? Because... - My aunt died. - And you cry for that? I don't cry if my aunt dies. What are saying, Peppino? I was very fond of my aunt. Where is my dad? - Who? - My dad. Dad... isn't here, cannot come. He is busy today. Your dad went far away. - He isn't coming home tonight? - No, dad has to do a very long trip. No, not even tonight. Really? That's great! So he will not look at my notebooks! Peppino, come here! Peppino! "... pious ox" "A soothing sense" "Of power and peace thou bringest into me" " Whether as solemn as a monument..." "... as a monument..." How beautiful, eh? A beautiful poem. What a great invention, poetry. What a knockout. And this one: "Midway upon the journey of our life" "I found myself within a forest dark" "For the straightforward pathway..." - It's not pertinent, but is still lovely. - Beautiful. Almost like you. Leave me, sir, otherwise who knows what that man might think. Oh, yes. I used to write poems. When I was young. I should start writing again. I once wrote a wonderful one. It said... "Before evening," "before the night falls and the mystery with it," "let your heart be clear..." "Let your heart..." I don't remember it. There were swallows flying, stars... It's nice, yes. But also the words of the songs sound genuine. - No... - Aren't we friends? - Yes, but... - So, don't worry. Come on. Dressed like that, you can't complain if someone jumps on you. No, leave me, sir. It's not good to do that for one afternoon and... never see each other again. Who said one afternoon? We're talking about thousands of afternoons. Think how nice... I start writing again poems next to you. I'll become general manager and write poems. You are really nice, sir. Liar, but nice. With thousands of girl in the city, beautiful and elegant, you waste your time with me? - I haven't any girl. - Yes, I believe it... You are the type of man that women like. I'm not interested in girls. I want only one girl, of my type. Someone like you. - You can't imagine how much I like you. - Yes, for one afternoon. Here we go again with the afternoon! - Come here. - We are at a dinner table. Can't I hug you at a dinner table? You can go. If I need anything, I'll call you. I have nothing to do anyway. Here. Take these plates away. Come on. Bring me a glass of water. - There is the wine. - And I want a glass of water! Look at that... He thinks of being in a movie theater. Leave him alone, poor man. He sees few city people. I'll show him now. - Excuse me, are you insured? - No. You're right. Don't do that foolishness. For heaven's sake. Insurance is just a trap. - Don't insure yourself. - Who wants to do it? It's a trickery invented by women. It's all for the benefit of wives. Let them do by themselves, those lazybones. Widow and rich. This is their ideal. Antonio, the fruit. - Now he will see. - What is an insurance? He pays a bit of money every month and if he happens to get sick, - they give you a lot of money. - I never get sick. People get sick, die. I never get sick. But one day, far from now, you'll get sick and die. - That's right. - Get in! - Have you finished? - I still have to eat fruit. - Then hurry up. - Hurry up... I'm in a restaurant. And that's my home, so hurry up! Antonio, come here. I'll come back here in a few days, while the lady prepares me the ground. - What's that? - Tablets. You know, I work a lot. I think a lot, so my nerves... These make me sleep. Yes, if I'll take it, I sleep tonight. Shall I take it? Well, you'll sleep like everyone, sir. No, I'll sleep deeply, like a log, with these. It's a sleeping pill. Shall I take it? There is a proverb, you know. - You snooze, you lose. - Thank you! - No, I was just saying... - Yes, I understand very well. - What did you understand? - Nothing and everything. That you're adorable! We looked for him everywhere. We can't find him. We called his customers. Maybe his friend, Mr. Lavini, knows something. We called for him. What shall we do, mom? Be calm, dear. Don't worry about it. You'll see he didn't get lost. My God, he can't have vanished! A fine mess. - Does your husband have relatives in town? - No. He barely speaks with my relatives. I phoned all his friends. I told you. Of course you and your husband get along. What does that mean? We argue, you know... After 10 years. But he is so good, so nice. Do you two argue a lot? Yes, don't let me think about this. Even this morning... - Mr. Domenico! - Don't think about it. Even my wife. Paolo. Aren't you coming, sir? Paolo! Are you all right, sir? That's nice. I haven't rolled back and forth since I was a boy. I did it on a lawn. One evening, after a fight with a friend of mine, I realized that there were stars in the world. It must be nice fighting on the grass. I've always wanted to, but I never did. - The greatest thing ever. - Yes, but at night. Even during the day. Wait! We don't have to run. Can't we be at peace for a moment? - Come on. - No, I don't want. But that's not the first time that you play with a man. That's why. I know men. And they know me. I like you, believe me, sir. I don't want to spoil everything for one afternoon. Here we go again with the afternoon! Look, why don't we go there for a moment? What, among the ruins? Where then? There isn't anybody. They are ancient. No, I don't want. I told you, sir. I'm afraid to start a relationship with you. Then it happens that I fall in love... I promised you that I'll see you every day. Do I speak Arabic? Yes, he is smart... He stays in town, flirting with every girl. and then, when he's reminded of... No, I don't want to go crazy with jealousy. What would happen in town? - I could be... sir... - No more "sir". ... closer to you and help you, as you say. And will you come immediately to town? If it's for work, even my family wouldn't say anything. - Then, go and get a bag. - Right now? Right now. You can go in a rooming house, a pension. You may come around here in a couple of days. And explain everything. I like you too much, Donata. I don't want to lose you. He was so thoughtful. He was so attentive. He used to steal electricity from industries, Inspector. For the vacuum cleaner, the refrigerator. Otherwise we couldn't make ends meet. Stop it, ma'am. If you go on, I have to arrest him as soon as we find him. Small quantities, very small. Some years ago. Actually he was a good guy. - Do you think we'll find that customer? - We'll know it right away. The clerk told me that his boss will return to the shoe factory at 3:00. A quarter of an hour left. Hurry up, please. How cute you are. Yes, cute... It was not easy. - Did you hear? - No. Trouble? I wouldn't have faced this fuss if I didn't feel something different for you. I was just kicked out on the street. Yes, but on a car. Everything will be fine, you'll see. Never be afraid. Life must be faced with courage and confidence. Good things are hard to get. But we'll figure it out. Next to you, one feels like a lion, conquers the universe. What are you doing? You almost made me smash my face. Hey, answer me. Nothing. - The brake... - What's up? - There is a guy that I don't want to see. - What are you doing? Paolo, where are you going? - Where are you going? - We have a lot of time. You're going the long way. You're going to the countryside. Here it's blocked. Here it's blocked and he cannot pass here. And through here, Inspector? It's all blocked! But if someone wants to pass... Are we playing war? Your son in law must not conquer a position. I wish he conquered that. - The train station of Morlupo? - Here is, Inspector. Watch the streets 11 and 12, so he can't go north. - 11 and 12, eh! - I'm the Inspector! My God, protect him. I feel so guilty. If I hadn't bothered him, he would have been more relaxed and... Calm down, lady. What about me? If I hadn't reprimanded him... That's life. You'll see that he doesn't take the tablets. Didn't you hear what he said to the Cavaliere? Oh, you don't say... So we did everything we could. Not even to capture (Salvatore) Giuliano, I assure you. My poor little daughter, come on. Look, he wanted to go every time to Ostia. Stop crying, ma'am. You'll see that we'll bring him to you fit as a fiddle. You will argue with him for another 100 years. A true panacea, he said.... - Panacea! - Yes, but he didn't take it! It was before lunch, Inspector, not after. I was listening to him. He had almost convinced me, Inspector. - Stop it! It's over now. - Ye, but you don't know. That was a close one. Very close. I was already with my mouth like this. - Where is? - There, on the left. Give me a glass of water, please. - I have to take something - Okay. 3242294, Rome. Hello? General Insurance, statistics office? Mr. Lavini, please. Just a friend. Who did he go to? To the Inspector? To the Inspector? For the Bancani case? No, never mind. Thank you. Sir? The water. Attention. As a complement to this morning dispatch, we repeat. The individual is on a gray Fiat 500 first series, dark sunroof. radio antenna, license number Roma 73479. According to the latest information, the car should be around Capena. - Anyone who see it, please call... - Sir, the change. - Keep it. - the nearest police station immediately. Look at that... A minute ago she was jumping around, and now she had a stroke. What have you done all this time? A phone call. I don't know... Something happened to the company. I don't understand. I wonder what my office manager did. He is a troublemaker. Do you fell bad? Hey, stop! Stop! I recognized the Fiat 500 immediately, but since he wasn't darkly dressed... Give me the police station. That's not for eating. She's poisoned. Hello, Sergeant Chief? ... with a light colored suit. A girl, headed to Morlupo. Okay. What? A dead chicken? Okay. - Call the headquarters and give them this information. - Yes, sir. Call police station of Morlupo and tell them to sweep their area with jeeps. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. Now I'll tell you what happened, Inspector. He is dead, someone found the empty car and is driving around with a pretty girl. Don't cry, my child. I feel bad for her. Maybe he bought a new suit and gave a ride to someone. Maybe he hasn't heard the radio. There are few of them in the country and not everyone hears it. But we would find him somewhere. Maybe he is in a romantic tête-à-tête with a girl, locked in a room... - Mother! - Why, men don't do these things? Or it went like this, Inspector... Let me guess too, please! If you know everything, what am I doing here? Maybe he had a business meeting where there wasn't a radio, He parked his car in a private garage and who finds him? To search the area it would take two days and a couple of divisions. So there is no more hope? Let's search, ma'am... Let's hope. I suggest you to go home. If we need you, rest assured that... It's easy for you..."let's hope". He was not even insured. 10 years. He was always postponing. Tomorrow, tomorrow... Don't cry, come on. It takes courage. When your father died, I felt like everything was going to an end. But nothing ends. Besides, you're young, you have a house and a lot of friends who love you... And some people don't believe in luck. This morning, I was among the shoes and without hope, - and now I'm headed to the city. - It's broken. - Why, it works! - Sometimes. There is a broken wire. See? What a pity. I'm crazy about the music. Why did you take this road? It's longer and dusty. No reason, I wasn't thinking. It's nicer. Nicer... These poets. Before, "how cute you are, I like you, you make myself crazy". And now you don't like me anymore? - What's going on? - The steering turned. Warn me me when you brake. You'll make me go to the city hospital. What hospital? Wait. Why don't we take the streetcar? Rather than break our necks, it's better to leave the car in a garage, You'll come and get it tomorrow. Don't you think? - No, there is no reason. I've just saw. - Yes, you see... And I slam my face against the glass, isn't it? - It's okay. - Hopefully. Come here. You're all dirty. Donata! There... That's the way I like you. When you are nice and affectionate. Since we left, you haven't given me a single kiss. And I am the same girl. - If you knew... - No, I don't want to know here. You'll tell me everything in town. We have plenty of time. Come on, let's go. Look, how beautiful! - Why don't you pick me some grapes? - Now? - Yes. - Now, that... Why not now? Hey, stop! Stop there! - What are you doing here? - I'm here. I went off the road. That's funny. Why did you go off the road? I went off... The car broke down. Where is it broken?! Why make such a fuss? He didn't kill anybody. What were you doing here? Speak! What's that? It's a small grape! Did I ruin it? I'll pay for it. - How much? - Come down! What do you pay? Thief! Come on out! Would you like to get away with 10£ ? Go buy grapes at the market! Food stealer! I don't know what to do with your grape! Crook! And he also throws it away... Now you'll see! - What are doing? - Stop! Stop him! - Get the plate number. - I'm reporting you to the police! I'll put you in jail! I've got your plate number! Gosh, just for some grapes! Yes, some grapes... You ladies have always crazy ideas. They have my plate number and they go to the police... No, people say that, but then... And if they do that? I don't want trouble. - Come on, for two grapes? - Even for one. You never know. They report me... The police call me... No, I want to talk immediately with a lawyer. Don't exaggerate. Take it easy. Is there a lawyer around here, out of the village? The owner of Capena olive-mill has a son that studied law. But don't tell him you know me. Are you really sure that your relative didn't do anything? He cuckolded his wife. He smoked contraband cigarettes. He tried not to pay taxes. He has 200,000£ of his company that he will deposit later this month. There! See? Something usually comes up. It's normal. He often does that to be safer and work better. Normal? You call that "normal"? This, my dear friend, is misappropriation. If someone reported him, he had every right to do that. - What? - So it is. See? All chickens come home to roost. Are you sure there isn't anything else? Think carefully. I cannot invent things. Your relative should have done the interests of his company. - Sure, they pay him. - But to the detriment of his customers. - Obviously. - And you call that nothing? Do you bet he annoyed people to insure them? Is it possible that the police are hunting down a wretch as if he were a bandit, a public enemy? It is possible, given that it's happening. But he is an honest man. - Does he have any enemies? - Sure, he has. He only has enemies. From the doorman, to his friends. He cannot trust anyone. He argues with his wife. His mother in law hates him. And then his office manager... He is envious. He is afraid that my relative takes his place. If he could, he'd cut him to pieces. So if he has many enemies, they may have agreed to get rid of him. Adultery, misappropriation, robbery and who knows... So what do you suggest him to do? The only thing to do is to disappear for 48 hours. If they don't take him within 48 hours, they can't arrest him anymore. He can be charged without arrest. So, after that, he can better understand and defend himself. My God, but how can he disappear? And where? Disappear? I'll tell you a place, near Rome. He is a trusted person, a good guy. His name is "Ninna Nanna". He is a tomb. He neither speaks nor see. Send him there in my name. Here. The important thing is not to get caught for a couple of days. 48 hours It took you a long time. What did he say? Nothing, he said that you don't mess with farmers. - One can go to jail in no time. - He's crazy. Yes, but I'm the one who can go to jail. I can't risk it. I have a position. Look, darling, you better stay here. What? I have to pass through the fields now! Do you want to ruin me? I'm sorry but you have to take me in town and find me a place. - Where are you going? State road is here. - No, I'll go this way. I remembered that I have to get something. May I serve you? Yes, excuse me. Look... Do you have a mustache? - Mustache? - Yes, how do you say... Fake mustache. If I don't bring my son a mustache tonight... I don't know if there are any. It's not Carnival season. These things are sold during Carnival... Wait! I will look. Concetta? Concettina? Is there a mustache? Now I look. How do you want it? How do you want it? Blonde, black, short, Chinese? What Chinese?! A normal mustache. - Normal. - Okay. I'll come down. And a pair of glasses, please. Black? Black... white... It's the same. These kids go to movies and we suffer the consequences. - Do we stop again? - Wait a minute. May I come in? Anyone home? What is it? I'm looking for "Ninna Nanna". It's me. What do you want? I was sent by the lawyer of Capena. You know him well. I need a place to be safe for a couple of days. - 48 hours? - Yes. - Why? - Well, sir... I lost my documents. - Are you from Rome? - Yeah. Why don't you go to some friends of yours in Rome? Who trusts his friends... Come here. - What? - Come here! My name is Ninna Nanna because I put so many bastards to sleep that you can't even imagine. I don't like jokes. I'm not in the mood for jokes, sir. Okay. - Is that it? - Yes. Have you gone mad? It's first series. Do you want to get in trouble for a trifle? But that's mine! Ah, it's yours... Well... I said it because, if necessary, we change the look of everything. License plates, wheels, paint... Yes... we'll take about this later. I'm worried about the place now. - Money. - Yes. Double. Look, leave the car out here. Go behind the little square, to "Braciola", in my name. Then come back here. - Braciola? - Yes. - That's it? - That's it. Braciola, Ninna Nanna... What more do you want? - Then, thanks a lot. - My duty. Hey, listen. - Do you want me, sir? - Yes. You can't imagine what kind of trouble you're in. I just want to warn you. Do you see him? He rats. He rats? Yes, he is an informer of Sergeant Chief. Scram, if he comes around you. He's hungry. - Thanks a lot. - My duty. - At last. - Get out. - What do you want to do now? - Well, I... - We better stay here for a moment. - Why? Since I'm here I want to paint it. You want to paint your car? Yes, this color is boring. Come on, get out. Come on. Tell me, are you kidding? - Right now? - Now. We are in no hurry. You waited for 22 years. A few more hours it's not the end of the world. Since I painted it gray, I don't know why, but it's all going wrong. - Are you crazy? - Yes, I wish. Come on. I am fed up! We left four hours ago and you've been waiting for the car for four hours. What am I doing here, the driver? - That's why I asked you to come down. - Why you assume the worst? I understand. Wait here, I'll be right back. Where are you going? I remembered that I have some business here. - In a church? - I have to conclude a policy with the priest. What? Even priests insure themselves? Why, they don't die, don't break their legs, don't have relatives? Wait here, I'll be right back. - Excuse me, do you want to confess? - No. Excuse me, father. Please, tell me what I have to do. What... It's hard to tell, because it's hard to understand. That's why we need to believe. You have conscience, my son. I knew it right away. And your conscience must guide you. The conscience is the reflection of a law that men inspired by God, better than everyone else, have said it was right to follow since the dawn of time. Regarding what you have to do, all I can tell you is: do not hate. Love. This is the commandment. Protect yourself from evil, never hurt someone. How can I do it? Put yourself in my place. Sure, that's the hardest thing. To find the strength not to hate, you must stay as close as possible to God and have faith. God is good and righteous. May His will be done. - Are you going to the village? - Yes. Can you please give me a ride? I had a car accident. Come on up. What happened? Who knows, some broken cogs... Cracked. - Do you want to stay in the front? - No. I'll be over here. This way I can rest. My God, how strong you are! Then at Nazzano I'll take the little train and I go to Torrita. I'm going to Torrita too. If you want, I can get you over there. That's not a bad idea. What a smell of hay. After being in the city, some hay makes you feel renewed. Who can tell. Giddy up! In high school I wanted to make poems. Poems... But they don't want to. - It is forbidden. - Why? People are very serious, you know. They do serious things and want seriousness. We don't eat poems "all'amatriciana". To make a living I'm reduced to insure people. Insurance... - Are you insured? - Me? No. But what do I care? I can't do that either. I'm hounded here like a criminal. I'm done. Paolo, calm down. You can't even imagine what I would do to see you relaxed. - Do you want to insure me? - No. - Do you want to tell me a poem? - No. Speak, Paolo. Paolo? Bloody hell, that skunk did this to you! Damn, If I catch him, only God knows what I would do to him! Hey, are you sure it's because of your office manager? Who else? I turned my memory upside down like a pair of socks. Even the lawyer told me. It's him. Wondering what accusation may be, to get me hounded by the police. But he is a mountain of garbage, a miserable black pit. He has no right to breathe the air we breathe. He must die! And just the day I found a new proven method. I have nothing now. No home, no family, no son. Ninna Nanna, Peppino is no longer my son. Cut it out! I used to love being home in the early years. She was nice, the boy in bed... I had the rocking chair too. Rocking, Ninna Nanna. I used to make poems. "Before evening, before the night falls and the mystery with it," "let your heart be clear..." I want to sleep so much, Ninna Nanna. Forever. There are 20. Will they be enough? - Are they sleeping pills? - Almost. Give me these. Stop it! Have you gone crazy? No, if there is someone who must die, it's him. It's not you, please. - You say? - I say yes! What can I say, no? If you spend two years in jail and he remains out, it won't seem like two years to you, but 100. Take it from someone who knows. If you shoot him right away, you go to jail, but for a reason. At least you'll go there cheerful, peaceful, with a clear conscience. He does not deserve to live! Rotten swine! Ruining this way a good and decent man like me. Okay, now stop it, or you'll become the biggest whiner in Rome. Make up your mind. Do something. What are you waiting for? I could paint your car and change license plate. You have mustache and glasses... - Listen to Ninna Nanna. - You coming too? I have nothing to do with it. These pleasures have to be done alone. Maybe it's not good. Why it's not good? Is it good that he ruined your life? Someone told me... we shouldn't hate. - A good man. - Who told you to hate? What do you care? You don't have to hate. You just have to break his head. Did Cavaliere Morini get home? No, I don't think. Did Cavaliere Morini get home? He went out 10 minutes ago. - If you want, there is his wife. - No, thanks. You will find him at 9:00. I heard his wife say that at 9:00 he has an appointment with some friends. If you want to see him, he went to school to pick up the kid. - To San Carlo. - San Carlo, thanks. The Inspector said that until midnight you can't bring him to Pesaro. Who finds out that when you put him a raincoat over the handcuffs? - These are the rules. - Excuse me... - Be sure that report is signed right away. - For the Mobile Unit, yes. - Did you take the phonogram? - It's in my pocket. Be careful, don't lose it. Even if I lose it, I know it by heart. Excuse me, I'd like to speak to the Inspector. You can't. He's busy. But it is urgent, important. What do you want? - I want to turn myself in. - What did you do? I don't know. The Inspector knows. You don't know? How is that possible? You must have done something. How come you don't? - If one doesn't know it, he doesn't. - Why are you shaking? I'm shaking for that. Because I did nothing. Then why are you turning yourself in? Why? Because I'm a good person. I have faith in human beings. I have a conscience. Okay, go see if he is available. Thanks. - Can I make a call? - Make it quick. Hello? Hello. Is the kid sleeping? Who's calling? Paolo! Yes, Paolo! Don't wake him up. I just wanted to say that I... I don't take revenge, I'm turning myself in. What are you saying? Paolo! Where are you, Paolo?! Can I have a glass of water? Are you here to turn yourself in or did you mistake us for a bar? Sit down. Come in. Go ahead. What is it? What have you done? - My name is Paolo Bancani. - What did you say? Bancani, Inspector. The one of the pharmacy. Ah, Bancani! At last! You're alive. But where have you been? Turning yourself in, believe me... it's not easy. It's not easy, what? What are you saying? There must be a mistake, Inspector. Bancani didn't have mustache. No way. He was without mustache. It's true. He was without mustache. What is this masquerade? Tell me, where are the tablets? Did you leave them around? You go straight to the other world with those. Where are they? The tablets? We interrupt our radio program to communicate that few minutes ago insurer Paolo Bancani, whom we all believed victim of an accident, showed up in person at a downtown police station. Only then he found out, to his surprise, the deadly danger that threatened him all day, and... No, you have to go. You'll see him tomorrow. Why do I have to go? Am I not your mother? Well, you go out anyway. Tomorrow, if you want. Francesca? - Sleep now. - But I was sleeping. Well, close your eyes. Pharmacy Good evening, Mr. Bancani. Good evening, Mr. Bancani. Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Bancani. - Good evening. You don't know me. I do. You got me crazy all day. I'm Inspector Antoni. I drove your wife home, poor lady. I was curious to see the face of a lucky man. - Me? - Yes, you. You learned more things in one day than many people in a lifetime. You kept a town with bated breath for 12 hours. You thought that everybody wished to harm you, but thousands of people tried to help you. If your maid had not remembered the stain on your sleeve, who knows where you would be now. But, didn't you read the papers? Well, read them. You learned to not steal electricity from industries... - Me? - No, me. ... to deposit immediately the company proceeds. ... to not cuckold your wife. - I swear... - Well, because you got lucky. - Aren't you married? - Yes. - Well? - I know, but it's not good. And above all, you learned to not have fear. Fear is a big trouble. The worst trouble. Can make change the color and license plates of cars, the faces of the people. If I didn't know all about you, I should arrest you now. - Me? - Yes. You should go to jail for two years. Do you understand now? Then we should all go to jail. But we are all in jail. Everyone is free to do only what is lawful to do. Remember that. Bancani! You're alive. You really scared me. You know, I'll fire you. - Me? - Yes, you. That's what you get for scaring people. My wife hasn't eaten all day. My children prayed for an hour. You're alive! You're back. How are you? What a fool... My God, what a fool. Come on, Bancani. You don't really think you're the only fool? We are all fools, don't you know? Now go home. Your wife is waiting for you, Otherwise she'll make a scene. I'll take care of it. I'll open the elevator, Mr. Bancani. I'd like to see... May I accompany you? No, let him do it himself. Good evening, Mr. Bancani. Good evening, Mr. Bancani. Have you seen what a story? And it's true, you know. In every detail. But we must not be surprised. It's a small story, similar to what happens to us in life, in 50, 70 or 100 years, maybe. A story that many people end without realizing that we are here trying to help each other to live, and to make us less painful this short passage of our existence. Poor people... They have not yet had the luck that happened to me: to find myself at the end of an ordinary afternoon, just before the evening falls.
