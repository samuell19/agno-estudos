LIGHT IN DARKNESS THIS MOVIE IS A MELODRAMA AND THE LEADING ROLE IS INFINITE Every step counts, and it remains in the mind. Death... An actress or an accomplice? It doesn't matter 'cause every drama is a farce. Life isn't worth our dreams. The other world is right here. MERC?RIO PRODUCTIONS PRESENTS LIGHT IN DARKNESS THE RETURN OF THE RED LIGHT BANDIT WRITTEN B Y ROG?RIO SGANZERLA Who am I? Today, it has been declared a state of siege all over the country! Shoot before you even ask! Shoot the happy trigger! I've already hit two of them! Any similarity with real or unreal facts, living... - Dead or imaginary persons... ...is pure coincidence. RIO DE JANEIRO STATE POLICE This is a Western about the Third World! Let's go, punk! PRISONS ARE PACKED THE ATOMIC SCIENCE PUT THE APOCALYPSE WITHIN EVERYBODY'S REACH Come on you guys, let's get'em all! - Let's arrest them all! - Yeah, Chief, right there! - Let's go, come on! - Right here, Chief! This is God's Punishment. He's down! That's not the way I rehearsed my own death. I've always wanted to succeed, but fate wanted the opposite! With God as my witness, I'm a prisoner of myself. I'm a marked man, only God knows and that's why He supports me! He spoke of God as his accomplice in a stinky penitentiary. Used to build castles of destructive thoughts, being angry, considering that his case was all wrong and unfair! Time moves backward here, instead of going forward! A club is not a saint, but it surely does miracles. True blindness is when you don't wanna see! Here in this hell, each one cares about oneself. As a half-alive person, empty, filled with solitude. THE DANGEROUS RED LIGHT BANDIT An awful loneliness had struck me. THE UNIVERSITY OF CRIME I had my life over, yet I suffered all of this underworld myself. My days are the ones of a living dead. I'm a prisoner of myself. The judge sentenced me to 300 years in prison. However, I always wonder. I never killed anyone, I'm not a murderer. I'm just a scamp forced by circumstances... and with a bad temper. I'd never wanted to show off, unless I'm the narrator. Time supplies me with images and I take care of the subtitles. It isn't exactly my life that I'm going to tell. I'm going to tell you about the life of a whole generation. We experienced all those things at the same time. I can't remember anything from my past. Except those things that I keep in mind. And I've seen my light in my brain. As I was left by my own shadow. However, you can only live if you know light and darkness. Who am I? I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit as Jorge. King of Cardboard! When I was a boy, I knew I had a mother and that was all. I felt I was another one buried alive in the favela. I quenched my thirst in the sewer and was raised on cardboard soup. There was only one thing I wanted, to know who my father was. Hey, throw the ball! I could never tell anyone what I felt in my soul. I was hungry and thirsty for justice. Feeling like an upside down celebrity. People called me Jorge Bronze. A laundry deliverer who loved his job as a laundry deliverer. As a teenager, he was fired for during a night of autographs, he wore a hot-tempered customer's new suit. At that time, he already used to shoplift because he loved being well-dressed. Now, Jorge Bronze leaves with four suitcases with fine, exotic clothes, boots, leather gloves and boxing gloves. As we can judge by the items, durable goods, no way! Once I robbed a newsstand. He didn't robbed it, he put it all on a truck, also stolen. Then, he and his pals chose the best magazines. That night, he went to the bathroom with about 10 magazines. He opened them all and started fucking everybody! I licked them, I bit them and I fucked them all. I deflowered and came with a foreigner girl. From that night on, I dreamed I was a movie star. - No, no, wait, mom! - Don't you get it? Your dad is marked. One of two, either he's insane or prisoner. Both of them. Your father made a lot of mistakes. But I guess he'd like to meet you. - And what's his name? - Oh, he's got so many names... He doesn't even know himself. Now forget about that, son. It's far too dangerous. Hold a second, dangerous? Dangerous how? How about this, you tell me address and I'll take care of the rest. It's not that easy. You'll need authorization from the judge. Jorge, your father is the Red Light Bandit. Now, I was the only one who was left. In a penitentiary, nobody makes any penance. A bunch of addicts, drug dealers, rapists, murderers... Criminals of all sorts. I had to gain experience. Me, a man who lost his youthfulness in jail, unemployed. CRIME DOESN'T PAY FOR POOR PEOPLE In jail, my life became a living hell. I was tortured for a month, guilty of crime I hadn't committed. PRISON IS DEATH PENALTY Red Light was found guilty of two murders, but he found out that at every new confession he made, he improved his conditions of permanence in prison. From that time on, he started to confess presumed crimes, until he reached 60 crimes. That way he obtained books, clothes, television, tapes... - Meals any time of day or night. - And could have visitors in his cell. His continuous confessions deserved gifts from the policemen. They would even show him official records of unsolved crimes. - From which he took responsibility. - Usually for all of them. I got tired from confessing crimes. But they said they'd take my privileges and send me to another penitentiary. A worst one, where I'd be treated like the other inmates and then I'd be condemned all over again. During that time, I decided to study. And to work out, trying to be the champion of it all. My days here are the ones of a living dead. When I got here I had my life over. - Who are you? - For starters, I'm Brazilian. Also, I'm an angry man. I've always been attracted to revolts against the authorities. They say that Brazil is a well-behaved country. - Well-behaved my ass! - I want to see you every day. I want to be with you every day! Only show up by the year 3000, when I'm already dead. Life is not easy at all. Maybe it is for Matarazzo and Rockefeller. Red Light, what is it with you masked gunman? - There's nothing with me. - What do you want from life? I'm the son of the most downtrodden man in this country. A FEW YEARS LATER... CRIMINALS - Main character, the anonymous public man, a mix of naughty child and snatcher. His nickname, All or Nothing. I'm drunk with joy. By the way, my name brings bad luck. By chance or by choice, I smoke cigars. And I light each one of them using a 100 dollar bill. If I was born to learn, I'll die without learning it all. ALL OR NOTHING PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER 1331 A COPYCAT OF RED LIGHT OR MICHEL POICARD? I won't drive to any crime den. Look, Pops. Wanna know how many I killed? Enough people, now drive. - Tonight, a lot of stuff can happen. - Right, I'm gonna fix my life. We belong to a barefoot and naked generation. This is the most uncertain night. We're from the largest favela in the world according to the UN! - This is statistics. - The absurdity thesis rules here! With bad examples coming from above, I can sympathize. In this country everybody steals, since our dark ages, of the colonial hereditary captaincies! If I had no family to feed, I wouldn't work so hard for nothing. Because violence begets violence. You young people should give up on that Brazilian brand! Dostoyevsky is nothing here, cabby! - Who's that? Yes, everything by the Law and for the Law! - Thanks to us it always succeeds, man! - Right boss, and the bullet rules. You know I lose my temper easily! I never gave any signal to show where I was going. Why the fuck should I do such thing? Nobody has anything to do with that! I don't care where the car in front of me is going to, so why do I need to let'em know where I'm going, right? Right, let'em find anything else to do, come on. Madness is not only in the movies, it's on the streets where movies are made. What about some oxtail soup at Juvenal's? Attention, all cars. High-class robber! Wanted alive, an upside down celebrity. - Mythic. - Myth maniac - Monomaniac. - Crook male from tropical kleptocracy! A character of our terrible times. The world is getting lost in a toy car. Everybody's going straight to hell now! This has actually been a prelude to hell for a long time. I have this motto, Gold or Euros. But I also take imported products. - The rest is garbage! - I've got nothing, everything is pawned! Nah, you're a rich man. Where's the money? I used to be rich. Now I'm only rich of my ideas. Why do you have prejudice against the national currency? - To me that's pocket money. - Lf you were a politician, perhaps you'd have a second chance. Bad examples come from above, from above! And we keep asking, if they can, why can they? Tell me why! But robberies apart, misery is to blame for all crimes. Anyways... if you tell me where you keep the money, I won't kill anyone, I won't rape the girl... I'll just get the hell out of here, okay? But, if you're not willing to cooperate... - Can I give you a post-dated check? - Do you take me for a fool? No, of course not I... Excellent food to take a nice dump, right ma'am? Our shareholders keep close to our government platform! But we still need more. That's why, dear viewer, - you must act right away. - Bullets are the Law around here! Lt's just too easy to speak! Shut up, Ze! No, I swear to God! Caught by surprise, the Police have no time to respond, going the opposite way, while he disappears. Later that night, he didn't believe what he'd done. HE'S THE KING AMONG THE LUCKY ONES This is the empire of chaos and gangsters. There's always a second rank. People like you Agostinho, trusted by the big heads. Some of the crime masters became bankers. The other members provide tertiary services. What, giving up on thinking? I'm allergic to crime! Drop it, boss. Dig the blond over there. Don't call me boss. My name's Justino. - Place your bets! - Alligator, alligator! In the megalopolis of the disorganized, yet raising crime, the same question arises. How do you make a criminal? Out of a simple delinquent? EVERYTHING FOR SALE "Time is a necessary representation, the basis for all intuitions. Time can't be suppressed by phenomena in general. Although you can easily separate one from another, time, though, is given a priori." Sorry to interrupt you, but this is not a five-star hotel. Time to go to bed. If you're asleep you can't think. I'd like to be an English man, but I can only speak Spanish. It doesn't matter which language you speak, this is a high security prison. To put it another way, we're sorry for not having our electric chair here! In Brazil, the big smartasses don't go to jail! If only a criminal knew what it is to be inside a prison, he would never commit a crime. Robbing with a red flashlight, he says, "All on social purposes." Following his own instinct, criminal included. With the complicity of impostors raising amendments... And weed in the Brazilian outback. - From the Al-5... - To the AR-15... Crime is just everywhere! The Police action will top off the event. Investigator Sadi's devoted career against crime. Bighead for his closers. - He's dangerous! - Seize that guy! - Arrest that rude dwarf! - Shut the door! Arrest the rude dwarf! After the Police trap, the Police chief feels sick, so he drinks lots of milk and takes some antacid. One of the active cores of prostitution in paid sex's geography, along with the threat of STDs, assuming the obligation of condoms. Got a light? You wise guy... Hop in. Why put yourself in danger? We should look for freedom away from danger. If I could I'd get rid of this model, but I'm crazy about this car. Ethanol-powered? Nah, just the driver here. How about celebrating with drinks? You drink when you drive? It's actually medicine for this hangover. I wanted to forget about Law troubles. Their job is to capture us, ours is to escape from them. Yesterday's survivor, tomorrow's victim. During the prolonged shower, she couldn't help it. We reached a new step. We got lost among our desires. Seeking the same target. I believe in myself more than anything else. Otherwise, I will be a prisoner at my own funeral. - Come on, keep walking! - For the love of God! A black man standing is a suspect, if he's running, he's guilty! Shoot even before you ask! - In this place rules aren't enough. - Just shoot fearlessly, man, do it! They'll regret the day they were born. - But boss, how? - It's the bullet law, Agostinho. Make up your mind, social worker or man of the Law? Will you wait till the prick blows you up? Let the Police solve the case. You know what it means to us! Election time, shameless and dirty politicians. And I mean it! May God bless you guys. - No need for deviant's blessings. - Deviant? I didn't do anything! Precisely, a good-for-nothing. Arrest this good-for-nothing. - You dirty crook, thief! - Get him! - Come on! - Please! God gives the food and the Devil cooks! Come with me, I do everything for love, sex included. - Arrest this doll! - It's all for the sake of Law! Niggers standing are suspects, when running they're guilty! - Move on, move on! - Just do your job, without a trace! Got it, Mother Curse? The Law always prevails, thanks to us. - Is that you, Jorge? - Your bandit, woman. Crazy boy, I missed you so much! You asshole, you asshole! Why do you keep this gun? Learn a trade, man. Switch the gun for me. I'm crazy about you! This won't last, Jane. I'll talk to my friends and quit all of this. Happy? And then what? - Help me! - Watch your head! - We're the Law, we are the Law! - Watch your head! I'm honest, pal. I steal, but I work things out. With me as your Governor, if you have money, you'll have more! I wouldn't be honest if I said there's other way, take it or leave it. - Yeah! - To victory! - There's only one question. - Until when? - Mister candidate... - Your Excellency. Pretty boy! Hurrah, Baby Junior! Nice apartment, Mister. Where's the money? - Are you not afraid, son? - Afraid of what, Ze, of poverty maybe? I want jewelry and Euros, I want strong currency, the rest is garbage! I mean, afraid of your future, son! Calm down, man, calm down! - God is not Police! - What future? I was born guilty. - I could establish my crimes. - Perhaps if you were a politician. I guess it was the wrong plan. There isn't even DVD in this house. Come on, Mister, where's the money? No! - Be careful, Glaucia, be careful! - Glaucia... Nice name for a lady. You say you're afraid of me. I'm talking to you thieves of Brazil. Nice chicken, huh? According to the old Chinese sages, even a broken clock tells the right time twice a day. Until they prove it's wrong, time has variable speed. With this clock, I can go back and forth in time. I was slowly reaching the mental state I haven't known for years. Lucidity. It became complete! Confined in that branch of hell, surrounded by a bunch of psychos. Trying to escape from myself, I finally found myself completely. I've always thought about running away, building my life all over again. Starting once again. Only I didn't know how. Power is something very treacherously. The difference between artists, criminals and heroes, is not the means, it's the final target. We have a life to catch, Dr. Runaway, we must act now. To blow up the world, a revolted man must only close his eyes. What's up my friend? Few people changed their time as I did. The world is going to blow up if it goes on like that. Only those who have their own style can resist this time. - My head has only space for freedom. - I think there'll be no escape route. Unfortunately I can't reduce time to dust no more. - Nothing else matters. - Was I born only to suffer? - A black, poor and marginalized man. - I have an escape plan. Dr. Runaway is my best lawyer. At 5:30 a.m. The whole city must be asleep. We're the only ones awake, alive and standing. Only a handful live their lives. Most of them don't live, they're dragged by the march of events. Like the flame consumes the candle, a cigarette consumes the smoker. I must live in danger until the end. - Why use your feet to drive? - Feet can do the same as hands. Poetry is what counts, Jane. I'm only trying to settle things my way. Stepping hard on the gas! What you take from life, Jorge, is the life you've got. Wanna know how many I killed? Enough people. Do you think you'll get a medal for that? Don't know whether I'm afraid, mad, maybe sorry... or have sexual desire, just sexual desire. But everybody is equal before the Law. But some of them... are outlaws. Crime is triggered by hunger. Inside the favelas, they wonder, If rich people steal, why can't the others do the same? ALL OR NOTHING A GENIUS OR A MONSTER? Hello? I'm glad you called. I just left Court and I have great news. We won, we won! POVERTY IS OUR MAIN FORTUNE - Any plans for the government? - Oh if I have any? My plans for the government will be greater than the Apocalypse. It'll be Judgment Day for Juvenile Justice, and for those who were abandoned by human laws. And to solve the problem of overpacked jails, I'm counting on you, dear viewers, adopt an inmate. Brazilian TV is one of the best in the world... In Brazil, only those with money are considered humans. That's the fact and it's pretty obvious. Donations are made by the high-class society to help. Hello? Yes, this is the residence of Dr. JB da Silva Filho. The well-known Baby Jr., my friend! Ah, no, no. He can't talk now. He's attending a meeting. Here we do everything on social purposes. Show yourself. Don't come any closer. Or I'll shoot. Careful, lady. Or else you'll shoot someone. Call the Police, but don't bang the drum, and no press. Do you smoke, lady? You don't? If you don't mind... I wanted to find a redhead woman, who only dressed in red. Not exactly a girlfriend, but just a hobby. If you know me you'll never forget me. Any promises in your propaganda? A lot more than that. Everything I do, I do with love. Sex included. You are affectionate, lovable. Your eyes smile a lot. Your face shows happiness. You won't regret this. Love is what I make better. I want you naked. Can I ask why? Striptease is the best proof of the feminine elegance. Everything I do, I do with love, sex included. Gold and Euros. The rest is garbage. And remember this. The human mind knows nothing. Just one percent of backstage could convince a lot of stupid people. Check this out. So, which side are we taking? You still haven't realized it doesn't matter? This a parallel fire. Life isn't worth our dreams, Jorge. There's no reason to believe in your name, Inez. Yeah, but it was... And his identity has been revealed! This is the story of All or Nothing, who's giving Police a hard time. All or Nothing became a popular character thanks to similarities with the legendary Red Light Bandit. - Legendary, my ass! Legendary my ass! That's enough, let's see something else! You're not allowed to scream, talk, whistle, breathe, stand up... Way to go, fucko! "Mens sana in corpore sano"! Pray. Pray in a loud voice. Everybody stand up, chin up, pray, it's an order! Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now... and at the hour of our death, amen! I want you to know that those of you condemned for robbery, murder, drug dealing, that criminals can't find easy life here, no way, this is a jail! This isn't any place for criminals to be seated. From now on I must fix up this part of my life. I felt my heart beat faster. My blood froze. All or Nothing must be reduced to nothing! After the shower, I dressed in new sportswear, went quickly to the barbershop and shaved. I had a haircut and joined the others, who cheered the home team. I told a friend that I would escape. He called me crazy. - No, are you crazy? - I'll just leave unnoticed. It was noon. The last of the Mohicans would be free in a single strike. - United we stand! - Yeah! Get in, in Baby Jr., this house is yours too, come on! Come on, check this out. Dear viewers, we're now at a maximum security prison, where the legendary Red Light is imprisoned. I'm a citizen with no voice. The only prisoner who's incommunicable without being charged. I wasn't caught in flagrante delicto, but I can't prove my innocence. And yet they say we live in a democracy. I haven't seen the movie based on my life being called anarchic. - So you consider yourself a hero? - Heroes don't exist. I have no relationship there, but I have some inside here. - You can count on us... - Like in the movies, images were juxtaposed. That was all about it. If there's nothing to do we'll mess things up. It was a beautiful day, and the reporters were covering the candidate's visit. I saw the entrance wasn't being watched and a escape could occur. A reporting team was preparing to lunch outside at the employees'club. What about family? My brain was working fast. Plotting something. When the gate was open I never gave it a second thought. I mingled among the visitors and began to escape. I crossed the gate that separated the courtyard from the aisle, and terribly nervous I started talking to this female reporter. I walked down the aisle with her as far as the main entrance. The girl was very pretty, and to make my plan easier, she wore a miniskirt and her legs attracted everybody's eyes. Having recourse to her beauty, I passed by the guard and left that hell behind me without anyone noticing it. SECURITY RED LIGHT, THE F AMOUS MASKED GUNMAN ESCAPES FROM STATE PRISON - Camera One rolling! - ON THE AIR The oldest inmate of the State Prison has finally escaped. A living legend, the one who was, and still is, the Red Light. When he was arrested more than 30 years ago, this case... - So you consider yourself a hero? - Heroes don't exist. And if we'd ask the big city who he is... It would answer, "He's my son." This is the enigma, in our dirty Third world, who can affirm not to be a criminal? Everyone is guilty, either by act or omission. The world is made of movement. And to live is to think. Thinking is the great courage and wisdom. Thinking brings it all together. I felt I was in the threshold of madness. Red Light Bandit is gone. Red Light is over. 18 Argentina Street. All or Nothing has killed the proprietor, industrialist John Christian. A huge police contingent surrounds the Garden Mansion. Over 60 police officers armed to the teeth. Chief Justino and his team, Mother Curse, Panther Claw and the Deputy Agostinho are here. Chief, what can you tell us about All or Nothing? You people from the press can't separate the wheat from the tare. You guys can't distinguish light from darkness. You guys only stay in the way! We'll see whether All or Nothing is all or nothing! Hi I'd like to order 10 pizzas. 5 mozzarella and 5 pepperoni. 18 Argentina Street, at the police siege. Anyway, I've always liked to perform. - I can't stand pepperoni pizza. - I like it. Hey that's the bandit! Trapped, All or Nothing dressed his victim's best clothes and left through the front door, whistling. - What's your name? - All or Nothing. No pseudonyms or nicknames. But that's my name, "All" for friends. Let's change this name to Neither Fish Nor Fowl, huh? They're all criminals here. Nothing is nothing. Do you think this is a Five-Star hotel? The time of the daredevils is gone. The Police is the best. Meanwhile, Red Light visits Madam Zero, former lover and intergalactic agent. The bandit became mystical. He needs to put inside him this whole ocean, in which he plunges. A character without limits, the product of a misery without name father or mother. Misery that make us say, "That's enough." I'm a survivor. An Aztec survivor. To survive I had to cross over hell. And face the dark and destructive side that exists inside each one of us. The real great men can't doubt future existence. - Because they feel immortality in them. - To immortality! ME Thank you, Madam. Thank you very much. It's income redistribution, Red Light. I dream of opening a bakery in Cuiaba. JORGE PRADO FORMER RED LIGHT BANDIT TODAY, A PEACE PROMOTER Red Light Bandit is gone. Today I'm the Divine Light. Today I am the total sum of my existence. Life is a succession of goodbyes. Good-bye to ourselves and good-bye to our good-byes. IS THERE THE INFINITE BEYOND US? AN INTERPLANETARY GANGSTER MOVIE That afternoon, the mysterious flying saucers... And again, the same unidentified flying object. All humanity with all the cases, from A to Z. With all the banditry and all the colors of the rainbow. From the highest to the lowest voltage, it's all the same! In this endless beginning, the world will never end! At least of one thing I was sure, I was really sure, that's okay, there is no God! This is going to blow up, no one is going to be spared. I had to leave all that disorder, all that buffoonery, which would take us nowhere! All humanity is one single volume of a single author. But the front cover is torn! Shuffled chapters of a same movie. Everything is illuminated by a terrible reddish light! The Third World is going to blow up! Those who wear shoes won't remain! And nobody can say what... It's time for a new beginning! I swore lies And I'm still so lonely Accept my sins The north winds do not move windmills All I have is only a whisper It's my life, my dead ones My twisted roads My Latin blood My captive soul I broke agreements Betrayed the traditions I broke the spears Throw to the space One shout, one challenge What really matter is not to be defeat It?s my life, my dead ones My twisted roads My Latin blood My captive soul
