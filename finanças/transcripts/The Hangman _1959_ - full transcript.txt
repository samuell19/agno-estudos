Hyah! Come on. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Whoa. See you in hell, Hangman! Come on. Let's go. - Hi, marshal. - Mack. Never through you'd capture Zimmerman alive. That's the way you wanted him, wasn't it? Yes. I want the man who killed Deputy Davis to pay for it at the end of a rope. I'd hang him myself. So would you. I don't do rope tricks. I just arrest them. I was afraid he'd try to shoot it out. He did. Not as good as he bragged. One more to go. - Butterfield? - Yeah. - On my way to Fort Kenton now. - Now, remember, Mack, we don't know what Butterfield looks like. Make sure you identify him first. I'd rather lose him than run the risk of a false arrest. I know, Clem. You taught me that 20 years ago. Good luck. Whoa! Ha! Hyah! Hyah! Come on, you! Get in there. Whoa. Thanks. Come in. - Colonel Hammond? - Yes. Mackenzie Bovard, Deputy United States Marshal. How are you, Mr. Bovard? What can I do for you? I'm after John Butterfield, a trooper who was discharged from Fort Kenton two years ago. Your office sent a deputy here once before - inquiring about Butterfield. - Yeah, Virgil Davis. He still with you? No, he was killed trying to arrest another one of the same gang, Zimmerman. Sorry to hear that. I liked him. You didn't give him much information. It's not our job to keep track of troopers after they're discharged. Colonel Hammond, two of the four men who pulled that job have been hanged. I just brought in Zimmerman. He's our only witness against the last man I'm after, Butterfield. Can you tell me what he looks like? Tall, 6-footer, regular features, fair hair, at age 27 when he left here. - Any scars or marks? - Nope. What did he do before he enlisted? Teamster. That's what made him a good trooper. A real fine fellow. Gentle with horses and gentle with people. As a matter of fact, nobody around here believed that he was part of that holdup. I'm sorry I can't help you any more - than I could the other deputy. - Well, you can. I want one of your men to come along and identify him. You know where he is? I'm reasonably sure he's two days away by stage. North Creek. I'd like to cooperate, but I couldn't detach a man for non-military duty without written permission from the adjutant general. - How long would that take? - Two or three weeks. No good. I've gotta get him right away or Zimmerman hangs and there goes our only witness. Sir. Sorry. Can't break regulations. Even if I did, I don't think you'd find a man to volunteer. They all like Butterfield. Every man has a price. Wells Fargo will pay a reward of $500. I've had men give information on a friend for less than that. Sorry, Bovard. I must stick to regulations. Company. Ten-hut. I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. And the mention of the $500 seemed to come out louder than the rest. - You interested in it? - In a manner of speaking. But you heard the colonel, it's against regulations. Why are you wasting my time? There's one person who you might be able to get and no permission required. - He's my man. - A woman. - A woman? - Selah Jennison. She'd know Butterfield? Know him? Oh, she could spot him a mile away. He was chums with her husband. She'd hardly been married a month when Jennison was killed. Skirmish with the Indians. How come she stayed on? No money, no place to go. Oh, if you could give her the $500, you'd be saving her life. I'm here on business, not charity. Was there anything between her and Butterfield? Maybe she fell for him, but his time was up and he cleared out, married another girl. - Where would I find her? - At the post laundry. Down there. Down beyond the corral. Just follow your nose and you'll find it by the smell of it. - Get out of my way. - Get away from my-- Ah, shut up! - Hey, what's going on here? - Stop it. Excuse me. Where can I find Mrs. Jennison? I'm Mrs. Jennison. I'd like to talk to you. I'm listening. Is there some place we can talk away from all this? About what? A personal matter. I just came from the colonel. - He sent you here? - In a way. You know a man named Butterfield? - Johnny? - Yes. Come on. How long have you lived like this? What is it you want? What about Butterfield? I have a warrant for his arrest. He was connected with the Wells Fargo stage holdup two years ago. I'd like you to go along and point him out. You'll be paid $500. Who are you? Deputy United States Marshal. Johnny Butterfield had nothing to do - with any robbery. - Why are you so sure? Because I know him. That's why. Yeah, so I've heard. He married another girl, didn't he, Mrs. Jennison? I don't see how that can matter to you. It shouldn't matter to you. He went away and left you here in all this. I know women, know how you must feel about him deep down. How old are you? Twenty-four. You look closer to 30. Thanks. A few more years in that wash shed, you'll look 40 unless you give up and land in a crib. Don't tell me you haven't considered it. Anything would be better than that steamy hell, wouldn't it? I'm offering you an easy $500 cash. In gold, if you like. All you have to do is identify a proven criminal. Get someone else to do your dirty work. The outlaws do the dirty work. We just clean it up. Butterfield was part of a holdup that cost the lives of innocent men. I don't believe it. Leave that to the laws, I do. Let a jury decide. Five hundred dollars is a lot of money. You think everyone can be bought? Yes. I'm not a sentimentalist. I've seen too much of life. There's a stage ticket to North Creek. It's better that we don't travel together. I'll take the next stage, you take the one that follows. It's a two-day drive. When you get there, just go to the hotel. Leave your name. I'll have a room for you. I'm not going. Oh, you will. I know you. I know myself. We're all alike. We do what we have to do because we want to stay alive. Decently alive. You'll think a long time before you turn down that reward money. There's your ticket. I'll be waiting for you, Mrs. Jennison. Whoo! Hyah! Ha! Giddyap! Whoa. The first one. Thanks. Oh, Mr. Bovard. Would you help me, please? I'm simply exhausted. Thank you so much. Would you mind awfully getting my bag--? I'll get the clerk to fetch your luggage, ma'am. Mr. Bovard! Howdy. - Howdy. You got two rooms? - Oh, yes, sir. Are you with the lady out there? I am not. There will be a Mrs. Jennison arriving tomorrow. I'll register for her. My name is Bovard. These are at the end of the hall. Best rooms. Well, hold that for Mrs. Jennison. Charge both rooms to me. Mr. Bovard? Yoo-hoo. The lady would like a hand with her luggage. Wait here, Mr. Bovard, and I'll show you to your room. I'll find it. I'll help you, ma'am. Hyah! Careful with the stairs. Well, Mr. Bovard. I see we're neighbors. Ha-ha. Really? Very nice. I think you'll find this a very fine room. Ma'am? Oh, good morning. What time is the stage from Fort Kenton? In a couple of hours. Thank you. Giddyap, giddyap Roll on the wagon Giddyap, giddyap Roll on the wagon Giddyap, giddyap Roll on the wagon I've got A little country to see Then hey, ho, hey, ho My gal will have to wait Giddyap, giddyap Roll on the wagon Giddyap, giddyap Roll on the wagon Giddyap, giddyap Roll on the wagon My gal will have to wait Hey, ho, hey, ho You the sheriff? That's right. Name's Weston. I'd been a deputy till last week. Blame idiot got married and quit me cold. He said his wearing a badge made his wife nervous. I've got to do all my own paperwork. - That'll identify me. - United States Marshal? Deputy, under Cummings. My name's Bovard. - Mackenzie Bovard? - That's right. Sure pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bovard. I've heard a lot about you. What brings you this way? - I wanna borrow your jail. - Where's your prisoner? Haven't arrested him yet. Wouldn't know him if I saw him. All I know is he's in this town. Who you after? A man named John Butterfield. Butterfield? Nobody by that name around here. He won't be using that name. - What's the charge? - Armed robbery. Murder. Mixed up in the Wells Fargo holdup. You've got no idea what he looks like? All I know is he's tall, fair-haired, under 30. Used to be a soldier over at Fort Kenton. That could be a lot of men. How are you going to find him? I've got an old friend of his coming in on the next stage from Fort Kenton. - Informer, huh? - Yeah. Meanwhile, I'd just assume nobody knows who I am or what I'm here for. Won't come from me. Shouldn't have no trouble. You had me fooled when you walked in. Figured you for a rancher, maybe a lawyer. That's not a bad guess. I studied law once. - Even hung up my shingle. - What made you quit? A long time ago, by a fluke I had to put on a badge and I found out I couldn't take it off. Always more rats to run down. Human race is full of them. You finally get so you don't trust anybody. This is my last job, sheriff. When this one's finished, I'm gonna see if I can't find what I've missed in life. - You can't quit. - No? Why not? Well, it ain't only a badge you're carrying. It's your reputation. You're known as the toughest lawman in the territory. Wherever you go, they'd force a badge on you, and you couldn't refuse. To get away from a reputation like you've got, you'd have to go clean to California. That's just where I'm going. You know S.G.A. Hodges? Sam? Sure. Runs a bank here. These showed up across his counter. Find out if he knows who passed them. Don't mention my name. Just say that Marshal Cummings sent them to you to check out. Okay, Mr. Bovard. I think I'll take a look around. Ain't much to see. Quiet little town. A lot of teamsters work around here? It's the biggest freight outfit in the territory. All goods all over. You know the teamsters? Yeah. All good men. Herb Loftus only hires the best. Know one about your age with light hair? Lots of men got light hair, Mr. Bovard. Take that teamster over there. Big Murph. Hyah! Tsk. Come on. His beard looks black, don't it? Nobody around here knows what color of hair he was born with because he brags he never took a bath. I'll wait for you at the hotel. After you're through, we'll have a bite to eat. You eat too fast. Relax and enjoy it, that's what I say. You eat here yourself? The food could be better, but I'll look after you, Mr. Bovard. See you get the choice. What kind of meat would you like? Uh, beef steak. I'll pick you the best. - Well-- - Well, I made it after all. All deposited with storekeepers. You check with the stores? That's what took me so long. They don't recollect too passable. These tied with that Wells Fargo job? That's right. That don't matter, does it? You've got yourself a trooper who will point out your man. What kind of fellow is this trooper? Oh, young, well-built, not bad looking. You say he's a friend of Butterfield's? Yeah. - You're wrong. - You'll see. I mean, he can't be no friend. Why do you say that? No man is gonna help hang his friend. What if you were drowning, going down for the last time? Someone will throw you a rope, save your life. All you have to do is point out a man. What would you do? If it was you throwing the rope, I might just drown. You lack imagination. You never needed a rope. You've never even gotten your feet wet. Money talks. You ever know anyone, Weston, who didn't have a price? I think so. Yeah. They just weren't offered enough. Everyone has a price. Don't count out you and me. I don't know about you, Bovard, but I do know about me. We've just never needed money that bad, and we're lucky. Do you mind, Mr. Bovard? Uh, no, no, no. Please. - Thank you so much. - You will excuse us. We have to meet the stagecoach. Have you got any bourbon? Whoa! Hi, Sheriff. - Howdy, Buck. - Howdy, Ben. How are you, Miss Williams? Oh, just fine, Buck. Might tired, is all. Thank you, Bill. Oh. Giddyap. Well, Mr. Bovard, where's your trooper? Missed the stage, that's all. Or couldn't be bought. If you need me, I'll be in my office. Uh, Mr. Bovard. Uh, that lady, Mrs. Hopkins, uh, she don't like her room and she's been asking about that end room across from yours. - Tell her it's reserved. - Uh, but, Mr. Bovard, you've already been here two days, and if your friend doesn't come-- I'm paying for that room. Hold it. Yes, sir. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Here, Johnny! - Hey, Al! Hey, back already, Johnny, my amigo. Hola, Johnny. Work very soon, my amigo Juanito. Gotta pick up another load. Yeah. Better water these horses, Pedro. You bet. How is that beautiful missus of yours? Beautiful. How far have I got to go this time? Let me see. Load me up as soon as you can, will you, Bill? Can I help you, mister? I was just admiring this team of horses. Ha-ha, well, there are no better horses than these ones, señor. Who was the man who just drove them in? Who else? The best driver in all this territorio. Johnny Bishop. I see. Get along, get along Roll on the wagon Get along, get along Roll on the wagon Uh, where's the trade office? Right in here. Anybody you wanna see in particular? Right, boss. That last tally checks. Some bucko wants to see you here. - Mr. Michaels? - Loftus. - What can I do for you? - Could you spare me a minute? Take a chair. A friend back home asked me to give a message to a man who works for you. At least I think he does. Works for us? What's the name? Uh, let's see, uh... Funny, I forget it. Well, it doesn't matter because it's written on the envelope. Shouldn't forget it. He described him to me. Tall, fair-haired, young fellow. Good teamster. - Lots of friends. - Johnny Bishop? He used to be a trooper. Yeah, here it is. Butterfield. John Butterfield. No. Nobody by that name ever worked here. You sure he wasn't working for you this spring? Not this spring or last spring or any other spring. I guess I ought to know who works for me. Al, you remember a man named Butterfield? - John Butterfield. - I don't know, Herb. They come and go. I can't remember their names. That's right, they come and go. Some of them ain't much good, either. How long has Bishop worked for you? Oh, a couple of years. Why? Well, I just thought... No, there must be some mistake. The message wasn't important anyway. Much obliged to you. Where you been? Throwing ropes to people in deep water? I just picked up a rope. One end of it. What do you know about a teamster named Johnny Bishop? - Nothing wrong with Johnny. - He your friend? Ain't got an enemy I know of. That's the way they talked about Butterfield at Kenton. Don't get no wrong ideas about Johnny. He's okay. Married to one of the nicest girls in town. - Yeah? - Gonna have a baby before long. That's too bad. I got a hunch he's the man I'm looking for. Johnny? You're on the wrong track, Bovard. You arrest him, and you're in trouble with the whole town. No worry, Weston. I'm not gonna take a chance on a false arrest. I'll make sure first. Hey. Hey, Joe. You ever have any business of your own? Right now I ought to be out on the reservation picking up another hauler that's been selling whiskey to the Indians. Not doing it because I've gotta help you find that trooper. You see, I can spot one a mile off. - They all got bow legs. - Even money this one hasn't. - Wanna bet? - Nope. I just wanna get this job over and done with. We'll make sure he's on this stage. He's gotta be. Whoa! Howdy, Jim. Hi, sheriff. - Ma'am. - Hi, Buck. Nice to be back. Giddyap! Looks like you need somebody to throw you a rope. Still say everybody's got a price? Well, I guess there's an exception to every rule. - What are you gonna do now? - I don't know. I thought you was a man who never gives up. They call you the Hangman? Outlaws do, not my friends. I don't like it. - Sorry. - I'll tell you why I'm licked. One more week, the only witness who can tie Butterfield to that holdup will stretch a rope. Funny. I'd bet my bottom dollar I've seen my man, but I've got no way to prove it. - If you think it's Johnny-- - Ah, never mind. What beats me is you're not even sore about it. I ought to be. You sure got a dang poor opinion of people. If I had taken everyone at their word, I'd have been a dead man long ago. So you're a style of man that is hasty in his words. There's more hope of a fool than of him. Where do you preach on Sundays? Come on, I'll show you. Deacon Weston. Human race with hearts of gold. Howdy, men. - Two beers. - Sit down. Al. - Howdy, sheriff. - Hi, Buck. Johnny, what are you doing in this hole? Trimming these two suckers here. I clipped him for 30 cents already, Buck. Oh, this is Mr. Bovard. Johnny Bishop. Howdy. Al Cruse. Hi. Pedro Alonso. Better not let Kitty catch you losing all your money. Heh-heh. How many? Two. How many, Al? That's the man who was asking about you. Two. Sure got off on the wrong foot about Johnny. - What are his initials? - J.B.? - John Butterfield. - Listen, Mack. Everybody in town knows Johnny and they all like him. How'd Bishop make so many friends? Johnny's a good man. Helps everybody. If anybody's in trouble, they just go to him. He's got you hooked too, my friend. Now I know why you've been trying to throw me off the track since I got here. Me? I wouldn't do no such thing. I'd go to the limit to help you. Now, don't load it on with a pitchfork, Buck. It pains me. Coming from a sheriff. Listen, Mack. Never mind. It doesn't matter now. I'm going back to Fort Kenton. What in Sam Hill for? Gonna do a fool thing. Gonna pay off the person who turned me down out of my own pocket. Can you beat that? I don't get you. I had gotten to think there was no such thing as a decent person. Deep down, I wanted to be wrong. Looks like I was wrong. Makes me feel good. I take my hat off to you. To the little trooper who wouldn't betray a friend. You catching the same stage as us, mister? Going the other direction. Haven't even checked out yet. Here it is, Homer. Whoa! - Here you are, lady. - Thank you. Harder! Giddyap! Can I help you, ma'am? Yes. I'm Mrs. Jennison. Oh yes, ma'am. Here's your key. I'll take it. I'll show you the way. But... Thanks for the beating. Two days of eating dust. - It's a change, anyway. - Yeah. An earache's a change from a toothache. Sit down. Not on the bed, though. I want the softest thing in this room after that ride. What are you looking at me that way for? Never mind. What took you so long? I had to get up my courage. I had to find out who I am. I don't care who you are. I wanna know who Butterfield is. What's changed you? I thought you'd be glad to see me. Changed me? Nothing. I've just come to my senses. I was actually going back to Fort Kenton to throw you a rope. - I don't understand. - No. You wouldn't. I've got him located. He's got a freighter's job. Everybody in this town's a liar. Even the man he works for. Loftus. And the sheriff. A man who wears a badge. He's been pulling the wool over my eyes ever since I got here. You've already cost me another day, and now I can't do anything until he gets off work tomorrow. Well, thanks for that. I need a rest. I feel like I've been kicked around for two days. You've been kicked around a lot longer than that. A ride on a stagecoach ought to be a holiday after that place I found you in. You're cruel. No, I'm not cruel. The choice was. You wanted to get out of the post laundry. This money will get you out. And you won't let me forget it, will you? Stay here until I call for you. I'll pick you up tomorrow afternoon. All you have to do is identify him. I might. Selah? Selah. I'm in here. What are you doing in there? What do you think I'm doing in here? You sure picked a fine time to do it. I told you to be ready. I'm sorry. I didn't realize how late it was. Oh, come on, come on. Quit the stalling. I was exhausted. I must have slept the clock round. I'm sorry. Why don't you wait outside? Why don't you get dressed? What do you think I'm doing? Don't take all day. All right, all right. Don't rush me. I wish you could have gotten someone else to identify him. Someone who's soldiered with him. Maybe I can. Wells Fargo doesn't care who gets the reward. And if I do, what does it make me? Richer. That makes me feel real good. Would you throw me my stockings, please? They're on the bed. Here. All right, hurry up. When I knew Johnny, he was nice. Nice or not, he was part of a holdup. - Yeah. So you say. - So I say. You don't have to believe it, just point him out and let the jury say. I've got a hole in my stocking. It doesn't matter. Get them on. If I carry out my end of the bargain, does he have to see me? Would you know him across the street? Anywhere. The freight yard's opposite the hotel. I'll hang around the gate like I'm waiting for someone. As the men start out, I'll be watching you. If you see him, just drop your handkerchief and walk away. - I'll do the rest. - All right. What's the matter now? - Nothing. - He won't even have to know you're the one who identified him. Sure. I just drop my handkerchief. Right. See, didn't I tell you? What in Sam Hill are you doing here? This ain't your room. It's her room, but he's paying for it. Now, wait a minute. Hold on, ma'am. I know Mr. Bovard. I'll vouch for him. I just didn't know he brought along his wife. Her name is Jennison. She's not his wife. Will you get out of here? And you finish dressing. Mr. Bovard. Now, ma'am, you just go right on down... How can you let him do this thing? Just go right-- Thank you. Sorry, Mack. Got old nosybody all steamed up. Said she'd go to the mayor if I didn't investigate. Didn't guess it was you. Yeah, big help trying to make out I've got a wife. Well, how'd I know? Nice looking gal. Where'd you pick her up? You're always wrong. Not this time. You had me fooled last night. I thought you were a lone lawman like me. Who is she? Where is she from? - Fort Kenton. - You mean she's--? My trooper, yeah. Well, she ain't no trooper. You said it. I didn't. Then she's doing it for money? I was a sucker to figure I'd ever run across one who wouldn't. Hyah! Come on! There he is now, just driving in the yard. Who? The man you call Bishop. You better be mighty sure before you lock anybody in my jail. I'm ready. All right, let's go. Over by that empty store. Remember what I told you. Yes. I drop the handkerchief. - Come on, Weston. - I don't like it. Keep your eye on that gate. Women. You were right. Some of them will do anything for money. You're learning. She'll skin you too. She will point out the wrong man, take your money and leave you in a jam. You worry too much about me. You make that jingle, Bob Hill. I want a lot of noise. You gave me a crippled horse. Wait. No, Murph. Hey, Murphy! He wasn't crippled when I-- Better call the boss. No, Murph. Hold it, Johnny. He'll kill you. What got into him? Hey! Why don't you try me for size? I loves a fight! Come on, hit him! Leave me alone. Get him, Johnny. Murph, what are you doing? What are you doing? That's it. Punch away, Johnny. Get him, Johnny. Murph is no good for nada. That's the way, Johnny. He got what's coming to him. Don't you ever touch that kid again. Johnny-boy, he looks too pretty. Let's wake him up. Come on, sweetheart. Here. Come on, baby doll. Good. Right over here. Time for your bath. I'll get even with you for this. Ah, you lard-licking jackass, what'd you hit Pedro for? He gave me a crippled horse. It was all right when I harnessed him. You can't handle horses, Murph? Why don't you quit? - Why, you-- - Hold it. Hey, Johnny. This is the first bath Murph has had since the big rain. You all right? I'm all right, Johnny. I'm all right. Johnny, you better carry a rock in your pocket from now on. - You forget about it. See you later, Al. - Right. What's for tomorrow? Gracias, Juanito. Here he comes. - Night. - Good night. See you tomorrow. So long. Howdy, Buck. Johnny. Good night. So long. - Didn't recognize him? - No. - Too far away? - No. It's not him. You're very sure this Johnny Bishop isn't Butterfield? Butterfield's smaller and heavier. That's not him. You know you're lying. That's Butterfield. - You think everyone lies. - He does, for a fact, ma'am. If you want the wrong man, all right, go arrest him. But it's not Butterfield. Are you gonna introduce me--? Shut up, Weston. Come on, admit it. You lied. Would I lie myself out of $500? What do I do now? Go back to the post laundry? Oh, no. Not yet. Tomorrow we change places. I'll be here, you'll be over by the gate. If he speaks to you or recognizes you in any way, I'll know you lied. Don't you believe nobody? Well, you can't object when you're so sure he's not the man you know. - Can you? - No. There's no sense arguing out here on the street. Since Mack won't introduce me, I'm Buck Weston. Sheriff here. - Pleased to know you, Selah. - Pleased to know you. How about I walk you back to the hotel? Of course she's got hardly anything to put on except that dreadful dress. Pay no mind to them old cats, Selah. She's just trying to make small of you because you're young and pretty and she ain't. And maybe she's jealous of you because I think she's stuck on Bovard. Every woman in town has been eying him. How about you, Molly? I think he's nice. Very nice. I've saved you a prime rib, Mr. Bovard. Thanks, but I think I'll eat in my room. What's the matter with Mr. Bovard? He's kind of sensitive, I guess, Molly. Well, that's a shame. What's the matter? I'm just thinking. What if that man does talk to me? Johnny Bishop? Men you don't even know do things like that. Not Johnny. He ain't that kind. I don't wanna get anyone in trouble. I didn't want this job, but at the time, it just seemed the only way to get out of the drudgery of the laundry. I didn't know how much more I could take of it. Don't you worry none, Selah. Ain't your fault if Bovard keeps on making a fool out of himself. You just go right along with it. Thank you, Mr. Weston. Excuse me, ma'am. My friends call me Buck. Thank you, Buck. You just go on and eat your soup before it gets cold. I, uh... I saw the light under your door. I've been thinking. About what? You don't owe me anything yet. Buy yourself some clothes. Ashamed to be seen with me? Oh. Nosy woman down the hall. Chased you out of the dining room, didn't she? Sorry you're ashamed to be seen with me, Mr. Bovard. Ah, you'd make them all sit up and take notice around here if you had some decent clothes. Get them. My old lady told me if I didn't get home early tonight, she was gonna become a widow. I better get home because I know exactly how tough my old lady can be. She'll take the side of my head and split-- - Where's Mr. Bishop? - Johnny? - Is he here? - No, ma'am. You're his friend, aren't you? Yes, ma'am. Please give this to him. - You know Johnny? - Yes, he knows me. Selah Jennison. - You in trouble, ma'am? - No, but he is. I'm here with a deputy marshal who's trying to arrest Johnny. This note will explain everything. Please get it to him. You run along, ma'am. We'll take care of things. All right. Thank you. Bovard. That's the custard who was with Buck Weston today. Heh. I don't even believe he's a deputy marshal. Yeah, I reckon he is. We took care of Big Murph. Maybe we ought to take care of Mr. Bovard. You know, I never like to put a gun on a man if I could help it. But that doesn't mean I can't do it. Come on. We better get this to Johnny. Come on, come on, come on. Selah Jennison? Who's she? She's an old friend of mine, Kitty. Why don't you light out of here and get that jump on Bovard? I've got the jump on him with this. He doesn't know me from Adam, and Selah won't tell him. What can he do? He's up a tree. You'll be up a tree if you don't leave town. What does it say, Johnny? Here. You can read it, honey. That Bovard is a smart one, but he's going to get the surprise of his life when I walk past Selah like I'm blind. Johnny. Hey, hey, watch it, kid. You know, I'd like to see that baby sometime. Thanks, Al. Please, honey. Please, don't worry. We've got to get out, Johnny. Get out while there's still time. Johnny. Kitty, you're gonna have a baby. I can hear his heart beat. Oh, Johnny. You'll break my heart if anything happens to you. Please. Please, let's get out while there's still time. I'm through running, Kitty. I'll take what they give me and start over again, but I'm not running anymore. Good thing I happened along. Thank you. - Where's Mr. Bovard? - I don't know. Borrowed my horse and lit out. Said he wanted to keep an eye on Johnny. Did you ever hear anything so crazy? You know Johnny's got nothing to run from. Here, let me have the rest of those. Hey. There's Johnny now. Hey, one of you guys finish the load. - Hi, Al. - Hey, Johnny. This man, the marshal, he was looking for you early this morning. Yeah? Why don't you ask Loftus for the reservation run? It's two days out, it's one day back. You'll get out of town for a while. Thanks, Al. I'm not leaving. - Where's Selah? - In her room. Butterfield-- Bishop just drove in. We've gotta get set. If you hadn't rolled out of here like a bat out of Beelzebub, I could have told you why he drove out so early. Had a hurry-up order for a load of freight. Wait here. Excuse me. Selah. Yes, Mr. Bovard? Come on. I'll be darned. Selah. Well, at least you recognize me, Buck. We've gotta hurry, he'll be coming out of that yard any minute now. You know what to do. Just walk up and down in front of the gate. Say, look at that. Wow, man. - Hey, look. - Something real nice, huh? Oh, boy, you see what I see? Hey, what's that? Yippee! Like they've never seen a woman before. They ain't. Not that cute. Hey. Wow, man. Hey, what's that? Look out. Come on you. Come on. Where'd she come from? Who is she? Look at that. All right, muchachos. Anything else, Juanito? No. I've gotta get home. Good night, Al. - I'll see you later. - Buenas noches, Juanito. Didn't even look at her. - Why didn't he? - Didn't know her. That didn't keep every other man from breaking his neck to look at her. They were looking at me as if I was a freak. I didn't mean to embarrass you. - Hi, sheriff. - Murph. You go on ahead. I've got an idea. Are you through with me? Am I finished? No, no. Not yet. Wait for me in your room. Mighty nice man. Peculiar. Don't know what he's up to. Whatever it is, I don't like it. Walk you back to the hotel? Thank you, Buck. You're very kind. It ain't nothing. Leaving so soon? Yes, indeed. I'm going back East where matured charm and virtue are appreciated. Have one with me? Don't mind if I do. Whiskey. - Your name's Murphy, isn't it? - Yeah. You had a fight yesterday with a man they call Johnny Bishop. What about it? You're making some funny friends. If it's Big Murph you're after, I'll go along with it. You'd like to help me make a false arrest, wouldn't you? You don't need any help the way you're going. I've just been hunting with the wrong bird dog, that's all. Find myself a new pointer, if I can make a deal. - Where's Selah? - She took a walk. - Where? - To the end of town. Guess she got tired of being cooped up, wanted a little fresh air. Johnny live in that direction? That's right. Wait a minute! Hey! I'm here! Looking for me? Yeah. I'll be out in a minute. Didn't I tell you to stay in your room? Am I a prisoner? You trying to arrest me too? What for? You feel guilty? Yes. About everything I've been doing since I met you. What are you following me for? You think I'm trying to run away? Not with your clothes off. Besides, a girl who can't see any better than you do - might get lost. - Oh, that's a joke? Mine isn't a joking business. Didn't happen to locate an old friend of yours on the way out of town, did you? I have no old friends here. Why are you so suspicious? Because everybody's trying to head me off. They've been throwing dust in my eyes ever since I hit town. Including you. Me? Haven't I done everything you asked? Maybe more. Even if you think I lied, he'd have recognized me. Yeah, he was warned. Not by you, by someone else. Maybe Weston. You know he wouldn't have done it. Doesn't matter. I'll find him. You decent? Not quite. I owe you an apology. What? I've been rough with you. I'm sorry. I was so sure you couldn't turn down that money. But after waiting for you three or four days, I decided maybe you couldn't be bought. Began to feel good just to find out I was wrong. Then you showed up. I saw what a sap I had been. Took it out on you. You follow me? Not quite. I figured you wouldn't. Tell me, how did a girl like you ever land in that dump where I first found you? Oh, I know you married a soldier who was lost in action, but what happened? Didn't they give you any pension? No, they didn't give me any pension. We had a fine funeral. Military honors, but that didn't pay our debts. They even moved me out of my quarters. The colonel was very sorry, but what could he do? So I asked permission to work in the laundry. Permission granted. But you had a friend. John Butterfield. Yeah. Without Johnny, I don't know what I would have done. If any trooper looked cross-eyed at me, he had to settle with Johnny. He was wonderful to me. What happened when he left? I was alone again. Must be what hell's like. To be alone, no one to talk to. No hope. No way out. Not till you came along. Now I know there's another kind of hell. I've got a job to do. It has to be finished. But I'll work it out so that it won't hurt you. You sound different. We better get back to town. Have a nice walk? No. Had a nice swim. In the pond? My gosh. Going my way, Bovard? I'll see you at the saloon. You're loco if you believe that big lunk. I don't believe in anybody. Every time I do, I get it in the back or the neck or play myself for a sucker. I'll see you later. You think that man will help him? He might lie his head off to get even with Johnny. What if he arrests Mr. Bishop? You step in and prove it's a false arrest. Then Johnny can sue, Bovard might even get his tin badge took away. How can I feel sorry for him when he outright accused me of warning Johnny? You think I'd warn anybody the law's after? Of course not. - What's in it for me? - Money. - How much? - Half of $500. But you've gotta be sure. Look, if I say he's your man, he's your man. A soldier from Fort Kenton come through here a couple of months ago with a surveying party. He saw him driving his freight team. He said he was in the Army with him. - How will you find out? - Easy, like I told you. I'm half sure already. All you've gotta do, Bovard, is make sure no one knows I'm the one who told you. How soon can you let me know if you're sure? Tomorrow morning. I'll go to work early. Be the first one out. You'll be there. If I give you the high sign, then you'll know Johnny's your man. That way I'll be out of it, see? Then all you've gotta do is move in and grab him. You can pay me the money later, okay? - Okay. - What's your hurry? Bottle ain't empty yet. Help yourself. It's paid for. It'd be nice to take a walk. He'd be suspicious. I'm the one who's suspicious. If he keeps it up, I'm gonna take a punch at him. And he better not get fresh with you, neither. You haven't done anything wrong. You couldn't, Selah. Thanks, Buck. You don't really know me. You... You don't know anything about me. Gosh, I know how you look, how you talk, how you walk. I know all about you. Where does Johnny Bishop live? Why do you keep harping on him? I just wondered. After all, I did have to watch him. He seems so friendly. He is. Does he have a nice house? It ain't much. He's fixed it up nice. Painted a picket fence white. Him and Kitty are planning things in the yard. Stands out, that end of town. Far from here? No. Next street over. Far end, behind the clover field. Let's get back to talking about you. What do you aim to do when this is over? I don't know. It's a nice little town. Quiet. A place to raise a family. What I'm trying to say is would you be interested in staying permanent-like? Couldn't offer you a lot, but-- Oh, excuse me, Buck. Not tonight. I think I better turn in. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Johnny. Johnny. Open up. Selah. What are you doing here? That's what I wanna talk to you about. Come inside before someone sees you. Kitty, this is Selah Jennison. Selah, this is Kitty, my wife. - How do you do? - Hello. What brings you here, Selah? Johnny, they're going to arrest you. You told him? You sure? - Yes. - You told him. She didn't, honey. I know Selah. She wouldn't do such a thing. I was going to. Don't ask me why. I was going to. I was brought here to identify you. But you didn't. I backed down at the last minute, but they're going to arrest you anyway. - When? - In the morning. Someone else is going to identify you. I told you to go last night. - Who? - That man you fought. - Big Murph? - Yes. Yes, that's the one. - No. It couldn't be Big Murph. - Yes, Johnny. Oh, Johnny, you trust everyone. This fighting is one thing. Putting a noose around my neck's another. - It couldn't have been him. - He's done it. Oh, Johnny. Oh, Johnny. If anything happens to you, I'll die. I'll just die. Oh, darling, you gotta get out tonight. Now. - We can't get out tonight. - Why not? You can't ride a horse. I'm not gonna lose our baby. I'd rather hang for it. God help me. I can't go without you. Don't worry, honey. We'll work something out. Don't worry. Selah, you better get back before he misses you. Thanks, Selah. And thanks for the note. You'll make it, Johnny. Promise me you'll make it. I'll make it. I won't see you again. Someday you will. Our baby too. Hope he has better luck than this old man. Hope he has more sense too. You think I was mixed up in that holdup? No. I was, Selah. I had no job and no money. A man came to me and said he'd pay me a hundred dollars if I'd bring three horses to a certain place. And I was a sucker. I didn't ask any questions. It was too late when I found out I'd set up a relay for three outlaws. But I swear to you, Selah, I didn't know anything more about it till they started hunting me. Then I ran like a fool. It's Bovard. Better get out the back way. - I missed him. - Are you crazy? I missed the shot. You crazy little fool. Sit down. I missed him. - Shut up. - I missed him. Ah! It was you. I've been waiting for you. - You're hurt. - Never mind. There's a bottle of whiskey in my room. Get it. Get a towel. Fine friend you've got. A man who tries to kill from an ambush. - It wasn't Johnny. - I'm sore at myself. I really began to think you were on the level. Twice. Twice I began to think you were something different. You've been double-crossing me ever since you got here. That's why you came, wasn't it? - No, that's not why I came. - Oh, quit lying. Didn't think you'd try to get me killed. I've had women try it when I was after their men, but they were floozies. You're just another one. I was trying to save you from that filth. Trying to get you that money. I'll make sure Murphy gets all of it! What are you gonna do? Are you gonna arrest Johnny? In the morning, yes. I'll swear he's not Butterfield. I'll swear he's not. - Look at me. - I've seen enough of you. Look at me. Think of yourself. You'll get killed. Don't you realize that? It's you I'm thinking of. I don't want the reward money. Oh, I'm telling you the truth now. - It won't work. - Won't you believe me? You've double-crossed me long enough. I don't need you anymore. Go to bed. And you go to hell! - You can't sleep here. - I can try. All right. Get out. So that you can sneak out and cross me again? You can sit up too if you like. You're all a bunch of paid bully boys. You're worse than the people you chase. Get out of here. Get out! You got nothing to worry about. You're safer with me than I'd be with you. Get out of here! Oh! Oh, good morning. Only way I could get some sleep. What are your plans for me today? - Plans? - Same as yesterday or what? Just stay here until it's all over. - Till what's all over? - Until I arrest him. Forgot my coat. - Where are my handcuffs? - Here. All right. Give them to me. Haven't you had enough? What did you do with the key? - I threw it out the window. - You what? I threw it out the window. Don't you ever give up? Come on. - You're hurting my arm. - Oh. Stop right here. You ain't gonna lock her in my jail. You got any handcuff keys? What are you arresting her for? - Let's get inside. - Wait a minute. You can pick up your freight, Bovard. What in the Sam Hill is wrong with you to do a thing like this to Selah? Shut up, Weston. If you had your hands free, you wouldn't talk like that. - Where are your keys? - In my desk. Get them. Get them. What about Selah? I'm trying to get rid of her. Get your keys. It won't work in them cuffs. Where are yours? Don't ask questions. Just bring those keys over here. Oh, come on. Come on, come on. Can't you hurry it? I can if you hold still. - You seen Johnny this morning? - Yup. - Where? - Seen him go in the yard. - Anyone with him? - Yup. - Who? - His wife. - What would she be doing--? - Huh? He wouldn't leave her behind. Well, this key won't work. I knew it wouldn't. I've got a file in the back room. - Do you want me to get it? - No, not now. We gotta hold those wagons. Come on. Ho, there. Hold it. - Whoa. - What's the matter, Buck? Just hold it, Al. - What's the trouble, sheriff? - Sorry, Herb. I'm acting under orders of Deputy Marshall Bovard. Say, you was in my office, wasn't you? - That's right. - You didn't use that name. I didn't use any name. I'm here to arrest Johnny Bishop. - Johnny? - Where is he? I don't know. Johnny left yet, Al? Only one wagon left, Herb. That was Big Murph's. He was with his wife. You haven't got him in your wagon? You care to take a look for yourself, mister? Under the seat. It's my lunch. Clean as a whistle. All right, go ahead. Giddyap. No one's to leave this yard without my okay. The sheriff will check the wagons. Don't hold them up too long. Time's money. All right, hold it! Whoa. I've gotta trust you, Weston. I wear a badge too, Bovard. It may not be as big as yours but I live up to it. - I know you do. - And I think you're crazy. And if Johnny tries to get away in a wagon, he's crazy too. And I'll believe it if I see it. Check on this one. Nope. All right, let him go. Bring on the next one. Whoo, ha! Come on, giddyap! You sure you saw him and his wife go into that yard? I spoke to him. - How'd he get away? - They didn't. How come he had his wife with him? He was taking her to the doctor's, that's why. - Checked in at the yard first. - That's right. Probably at Doc Evans' office now unless he's taken her home. He got away in a wagon right under my nose. But how? - I'm going up to doc's office. - Don't waste your time. Let's get inside and file these things off. Look, I'm sick of being dragged around like a sick calf. Murphy. That big double-crossing bull had them in his wagon. They know he's the only man I wouldn't suspect. Don't you believe nothing? Wasn't he the only one turned south for the border? The wagons we checked went north. You'll have to go after him. I ain't going on no wild goose chase. You get yourself another sheriff. Weston. Come on. What are you doing? Never mind. Get on here. Come on, come on, come on. Get up. All right, you're hurting my arm. Never mind that. If he won't go after him, I'll get him myself. Hyah! Hyah! Slow down, you crazy fool. Will you be quiet? You're hurting me. Hyah! Hyah! Whoo, ha! Come on, giddyap! Hyah! Whoa! Come on. Hold it. Hold it! Pull up! Stop your wagon! Pull up. Pull up. Stop the wagon. Whoa. Whoa. You just lost yourself some money. If you're looking for trouble, you sure found it. You've got Butterfield in that wagon. Don't know no Butterfield. You tried to double-cross me, Murphy, now we're going back to town. Turn the wagon around. You're not giving me any orders. Get down off that wagon. If you didn't have that girl with you, I'd take your head right off your shoulders. - Don't think I can't do it. - Get down. - Hold it, Murph. - I'll kill him. No, he'll kill you. He's got a gun. No use. He's got me. Butterfield? That's right. All right, turn him around. Turn the team, Murph. Giddyap. Giddyap. Hyah! Go on. Giddyap. - You let me down. - Let me off of this! The key's in my stocking, for heaven's sake. - It's what?! - It's in my stocking. Oh, no. - Who took Kitty home? - Selah. Murph took them both in the wagon. He's your prisoner, not mine. What's Johnny arrested for? - What's the charge? - Robbery and murder. - I don't believe it. - Neither does he. - Do you believe it, Mr. Bovard? - It's not up to me. I do my job, same as you do, Mr. Loftus. And I mind my own business. You clear this thing, Johnny, you got your job back. Now, I'll see the Kitty is took care of. Thank you, sir. There seem to be a minority of one in this town. You ain't popular. What do you think, Buck? This way, ma'am. No, thank you. Won't you? Funny thing, I'm the one who should be mad but I'm not. You are. I'm leaving town with my prisoner. What are you going to do? I might stay here. I can find some kind of work here. Or maybe I'll get married. Good idea. Or I can go back. I've still got my ticket. What business is it of yours? I brought you here. If you had that 500, you'd be on your feet. I'll see you get it. I can tell the Wells Fargo people that you pointed him out to me. Gave me information leading to his arrest. Why would you do that? Because I hate to see you go back to Fort Kenton. I think you meant it when you said you wanted to start in a new place. I'll make out. What do you care what happens to me? I don't. I do. I care about you the way I'd care for an orphan kid who didn't have enough brains or sense to take care of himself. I've got the money to loan you. Will you take it and get a fresh start here? I don't want your blood money. You drew a little blood from me, didn't you? You crossed me up six ways from Sunday. If I was an outlaw, I'd rather have you for a friend than ten men with shotguns. Yeah, you sure did your best. Or worst. What happens to Johnny now is no business of yours. Even if you hang him? Will you stop saying I hang people? I only arrest them. That's what they call you, isn't it? The Hangman. Selah. And now you're gonna hang an innocent man. Let the jury decide who's innocent. Yes. Johnny tells the jury that he only held some horses. He didn't know what it was for. He was foolish and he didn't ask any questions. What's your jury gonna say? Is that what happened to Johnny? I'm asking you. What's your jury gonna say? You know what they're gonna say. They're gonna say, "Hang him." Hang him, that's what your jury is gonna say! Hang him! Hang him! You have to be quiet, ma'am. - Or leave this room. - I'm glad to leave this room. I'm tired of looking at this hangman. This is a respectable hotel, madam. My stars. Mr. Bovard, do you really hang people? Selah? Can't you leave me alone? No, I'm afraid not. Before I leave town, I wish we could understand each other. I understand you. - You're nothing but a-- - A hangman, yes. You're too young to understand. I'm not too young. You said yourself I look 30. Well, I was looking through soap suds. You're not grown-up yet. You're too young to understand a man like me. Maybe I'm too old to understand a girl like you. Time is like a barbed wire fence. When too many years pile up, we can't get across to each other. It's hard for me to understand a young fella I once knew. He studied law, wanted to help people. His brother told him they needed lawyers in California. Land agents were robbing people out there. Lawyers could help. So he started west with this brother. They didn't get to California. Stage was held up, his brother was killed. When they got to town, the sheriff had cold feet. He knew the holdup gang, but he was afraid to arrest them for fear they'd kill him. This young fella couldn't see it that way. Got himself a deputy's badge. Took him a while, but he rounded up the men who had killed his brother. Yeah, they were hung. Found out it was easier to put on a badge than take it off. Folks said they needed him. So he just kept on, getting more distrustful, more cynical. Getting older. It's a lonesome business, Selah, being a hangman. Well, I'd better go and see the sheriff. He's a mighty good man, Selah, even if he doesn't think too much of me. You could do a lot worse. Oh. Here's a clean $500. I'll collect from Wells Fargo. Wait. I'm sorry I said what I said. I don't know who's right or wrong. Neither do I. Who does? We go along, things happen. We do what we have to do, try to live by the rules. It don't always work. Now, forget it. You're out of the woods now. You're young. Start over, start living again. You know, that young sheriff, he melts like butter every time he looks at you. Marry him, Selah. He's not half good enough for you, but I think you'll make something out of him. If I were his age, I'd give him a run for his money. Here he comes. Somebody at the hotel wants to see you. She say so? I'm a mind reader. I'll have plenty of time with Selah after you're gone. Al here wants to see Johnny. I just talked to his wife. I figured he'd like to hear from her. Okay if I go in? - Make it quick. - Thanks, sheriff. Isn't there anybody in this town isn't a friend of Johnny's? Can't think of anybody. Except Big Murph. Well, anyway I showed you, you wouldn't believe it. I'll get a shave. Johnny, I'm gonna bust you out of this jug. No, you're not. Somebody will get shot. I haven't got a gun and you won't have one either. Don't bother, Al. I'm not running anymore. When you get out of here, there'll be a horse outside. Get on that horse and you get fast. You can make it across the border before he catches up with you. Big Murph and I will bring Kitty to you later. I'm gonna bust you out, so you get. - Good day, sir. - How are you? - Shave? - That's right. Sit right down in a nice comfortable chair. I'll give you a nice shave, sir. Yessirree, boy. Lot of business today. Are you the fella that arrested Johnny? Are you another one of his friends? I can't believe he's done anything wrong. Don't let that razor slip. Gonna give you a nice close shave. Here we are, right here. That's a nice hot towel, sir. That'll make you feel nice for shaving. Sam. Get away, Sam. You ain't gonna get Johnny. No, señor. You ain't gonna get Johnny. Get away, Sam. Come on out. - Lock him up, Buck. - He tried to kill him, sheriff. I missed him. I missed him. Shut up. I missed him. I missed him. I missed him. Got yourself another prisoner. I don't want him. No charges. - But he tried to kill you. - Turn him loose. After I'm out of town. How does Butterfield make so many friends? By doing things for people, I told you. Yeah, what did he do for you? Well, that's a fair question. Men like us come up against mean skunks makes us mean too. Whenever I see somebody doing things for people instead of against them, it makes me feel better. That's what Johnny done for me. - Let's finish the job. - Yes, sir. Whoa. Johnny, Johnny, get the chain. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! No, don't! Ha-ha. He got away. Hell of a shot I am. - What now? - Nothing. Ain't you going after him? - Haven't got a horse. - Well, I'll get you one. Ah, you'd get me some old cripple. By the time I caught up with him, the only witness against him would be hung. He'll come back here Scot-free in a few days. Serves me right for missing him. You shot over his head, didn't you? - Do something for me, Buck? - Anything, Mack, you bet. Send that back to Marshal Cummings. - You quitting? - Well, a man who can't shoot any straighter than I can has gotta quit. Tell Cummings I'll write him from California. See, Selah? I'm going to copy you. Start a new life. Or pick up an old one where I left off a long time ago. Oh, here's a-- Here's a souvenir for you, Buck. Look out or she'll lock them on you for life. She's got the habit. Well, so long, Buck. So long, Mack. You know, Selah, Buck and I had an argument about friendship. I said everybody had a price and I believed it. I'm eating crow. What's more, you like it. Johnny done something for you too. No, Selah did. You decided what you're going to do? She's gonna marry me, Mack. That's what I figured. Least ways, I've asked her to. Oh? What did she say? Get in, Mr. Bovard. Just a minute. What did she say? Well, I know what she's gonna say. I ain't gonna rush her. I can wait. Mr. Bovard. Well, I won't be seeing you again, Selah. Kind of like to know before I leave. You know you have my blessing. Buck... I like you. You don't know how much I like you. But I'm going to California. I don't know what's happening to me. Even if he doesn't want me, I'm going. I want you. Selah. He's not half as nice as you are. But it just had to be. I don't deserve her either, Buck. Giddyap. Get. Ha! Bye, Buck. Bye. So long, Buck. Take care of yourself. Bye, Buck. So long, Selah. Mack. Good luck.
