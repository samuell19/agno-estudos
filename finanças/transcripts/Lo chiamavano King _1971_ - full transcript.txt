No, just in time, I spread the rumor that we were here, I waited for this son of a bitch to fall into the trap, You used us as bait?

It?s empty! Please, dear brother, you're disgusting. "Please, dear brother, you're disgusting!" You're checking how ugly you are?

Come, I?ll buy you a drink, No, wait, I have a better idea, And I?m sure you'll like it, Let's go, - Another 25km and we'll be in Tucson, - Are you so eager to get there? Of course i am! I?m your husband, don't forget it, That's right, I had forgotten, Thanks, Very nice, Women are the most patient, And what if we changed our plan? Let's stop for a couple days in an inn nearby, And after, if we want, we'll take the train to the east. To Atlanta maybe, - What do you think? - It?s a wonderful idea, - Anything else? - No, Is the room ready? Yes, The lucky devils! Hello, Do you want me to make something? A drink?

They told me : ''We won't kill him if you're nice,'' But they,,, I?m sorry, John, It looks like the Bensons did it, No, We'll catch and arrest them, Thank you, But it's my business, Then go to Lenon City, You'll find sheriff Roberts, He'll help you, Thank you, Brian, Take care of Carol, She needs some support, You can count on me, I can't believe it, look at that! The bounty on Boyd's head is now $3000, I?d like to know where he is, Six feet under, King! I?m happy to see you, I need some info, I want the Benson brothers, Well,,, It?s a dirty case, lf you want my advice, don't mess with these guys, They killed George, They killed your brother? Very well, I know someone who knows where they are, Me too, I know where they are, - Where? - Right outside, Sheriff! We don't want to hurt you, Give us this motherfucker and we'll be on our way, Go to hell! Fine, have it your way, The dynamite, quick! Let's go! They're coming! Go throw the dynamite, The stupid fucks! Don't let them escape, No, they didn't cross the border. With us and the Mexican soldiers, it's well guarded, But a band of Mexicans crossed the border around here, Maybe the Benson brothers joined them, Then we'll catch them all, I?ll be watchful, We have several patrols in the area, You know Morse code, Warn them if you see anything suspicious, All right, - See you soon, - Good bye, It?s nice melody, George loved it very much too, Yes, I know, I have some news from King, He's at the Mexican border, He must kill the Benson brothers, He has to, Leave her alone, Give the signal, Killed by machine guns, You let those wagons pass, You'll be judged for complicity of murder of your fellow soldiers, Halt! You, go this way, Forward! Stand there, What a country! Who's this damn King, sergeant? I have no idea, Give them to me, It?s the reckon signal! Get ready to answer, A large band of Mexicans,,, in the yellow canyon caves, I?m answering, Flanagan! Yes, sir? Bring that to major Erikson, Yes sir!, It?s your turn now gentlemen, Catch them, Six Gatling machine guns, Se?or King, with this weapons, I?ll get rid of the soldiers that you just called for help, Well done, but they'll still get you, That's life, amigo! One day, you think you're a king, People's lives depend on one of your moves, Then, you become a dirty cockroach, just good to be smashed, You see, my dear Yankee, you helped me a great deal by warning the soldiers of your country who were supposed to come here to hang us, I?m very grateful, And I would have let you go, but those three Benson retards want you dead of course, Killing is a hobby for them, The only thing I can do is to leave you here tied up, And when those stupid soldiers will come here everything will explode, It?s a good death, No suffering, Manolo! Watch him carefully, Let him in, - Have a sit, please, - Thank you, Secret service? What can I do for you? Apparently you know John Marley quite well, Yes, I know him very well, Do you know that a shipment of weapons disappeared in Virginia? Yes, One hundred Winchester rifles, 10 000 bullets, six boxes of explosives,,, and six Gatling machine guns, Six machine guns? If they fall in the hands of a band of Indians we'll need two regiments, And your friend Marley, do you trust him? Absolutely, In Tucson, they also trusted Marley's signature, And the convoy went through, It wasn't King's signature, It was! This is just a killer, a bounty hunter, He only kills outlaws that he hates, His parents were killed when he was young, Major Erikson, the order I showed you requires you to help me to arrest several men, And the first one is John Marley, Is that clear? He left Roxton City 8 days ago to come here, He's at the border looking for the Benson brothers, That's what I was saying! The convoy is heading to the border, Are our men well-armed? 4 squads left to fight the Mexicans, Jason! Tell major Johnson to get ready, The Mexicans have the machine guns, It?s a trap, Yes, Of course, A damn trap, Six machine guns, set on strategic places, will annihilate the four squads in ten minutes, Who told you that the Mexicans were here? They crossed the border last month, Their government asked us to send them back, And it's King who told us where they're hiding, That's good, No way, I can't believe that he's involved in all this, So? It?s all there, Regarding this King piece of shit, I just want him dead, I don't care how, Out! Get out! - What else do you want? - Two women, You just have to ask! Jose, two muchachas for our amigos, No, The two over there, Son of a dog! Are you crazy? Very well,,, Then you'll have to put your machine guns together on your own, What's that? A little part from the machine guns, But,,, know that without it put at the right place, they will be useless, We've hidden the others, So? What will you do? It?s my wife and my sister! He's always been loyal to me, lf I ask him to sacrifice himself, he'll do it, But this one, over there,,, He's a brute, Chico! Come here, Chico! He won't accept it, Unless you beat him, But know that no one ever beat him before, What about a fight? Okay, On your feet, Chico! Fight for your wife, you worthless bastard! Bravo! Stop, we need those weapons, Bueno, Take the women, Put the machine guns together and shoot the soldiers, Yes, chief, - We fuck them first? - Good idea! Let go of me! Brother! Come here, There's enough for three! No, I?m going to take care of the other motherfucker, The famous King tied like a sausage, Forget it, Don't touch the prisoner, Chief order, All right, Our turn now, Let's have some fun, lf the trap worked,,, you'll be in big trouble, But first, deliver Marley to me, if you manage to arrest him of course, Go get the Benson brothers, We must go now, The soldiers are coming! Warn the chief! Chief! The soldiers are coming! Get in position! Get the machine guns! Let's go, - King! - The bastard! This way! Quick! Let's go, Throw your weapons! Your leader is dead, This way! Follow him! You're under arrest, What are they doing here? - I want to play with you, - I don't want to, I only play with John Marley, You'll have to wait a long time then, King has been arrested by the soldiers, One of their officers will come here, HE probably kicked a general's ass, No, it's more serious, Gun trafficking, Open the cell, - Hello, King, - Leave me alone! I told everything to this stupid Gordon, Secret service, my ass! - I?m also in trouble, - But I?m in jail! I know that you're innocent, But you have to prove it, lf I knew where to look, I?d take the horse behind the general store and I?d prove that I?ve been set up, And everything would be fine, The only thing I don't like, is the headache I?m going to have next, But we don't have any choice, Guard! It?s late, - Good night, Brian, - Good night, Carol, King escaped, We have the order to catch him, Dead or alive, Do you think you can do it? Yes, Why? lf you had your gun in your hand and he had his in the holster, he would still get you, The only way,,, to beat him, is to shoot him in the back, Carol? Yes? I have news about King, Anybody here? Very well, King, What do you want? I want you to understand that I?ve nothing to do with those weapons, I?ve been set up, And I know who did it, I know that you never signed the paper for the farming equipment, But then? lf I hadn't done that you wouldn't have helped me, Tell me where Ben Benson is, Where you wouldn't look for an assassin, In jail? Yes,,, I want to be sure, Fucking scumbag! Yes, I raped her, Don't be mad, Get rid of this scum, King is here, It?s your turn to play, And why not you? You're the law, It?s your duty, No, You must fix your own mistakes, All right, You're the boss, Follow him, Chief! Benson is taking his horse, He's running away! I knew it, Let's get rid of King first, Get to your positions, Brian! Come out! John Marley, in the name of the law, you're under arrest, What law? Yours? Brian Foster! Surrender, No, he's mine! Don't interfere, He's mine,
