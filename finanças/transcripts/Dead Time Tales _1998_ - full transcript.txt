(Laser music) (dramatic music) - Did you know that book is over 50 years old, Winnie? Did you know that, handling it weakens the spine and decreases the value? - I'll be careful, I won't, weaken the spine or decrease the value. I'm right in the middle of a good story. - You're an antique dealer now Winnie. Not a book reviewer. They fired you remember? Now go put the book back on the shelf please. - The book's 50 years old. It's probly not worth anything. - You know what they say, once you start eating the profits, you might as well close the candy store. - What the hell does that mean? Who says that? Who are they? - My mother said that. - Sorry about your mother. I didn't mean to say anything about her. - She always said I was a fool to get mixed up with you. - Please Alice, let's not go there again. - Ya can't hold a job, head in the clouds, don't even know what you wanna do, much less do it. - I know what I wanna do.

See that would mean, that would be more work for you, than staring into space wouldn't it? - Please, Alice? - You're a lousy cook, a lousy bookkeeper, a lousy chauffeur. You've lost every job you've ever had. She was absolutely write about you. Even now. - What do you mean, now? - Look outside Winnie. This is Cade's Antique store, not Kale's. She left us this place remember. If it weren't for her, you wouldn't have the opportunity to be the lousy business owner that you are. - I'm sorry about your mother. I didn't mean to say anything about her. I'm sorry. (Ding) - Hello, delivery. - Oh hello. - Hello. - What's this? - One box, delivered to Cade's Antiques. - This is the place. - It's the estate antiques I bought at auction last week while you were tending the store. - I don't remember. - Of course not, you were too busy writing. It's a box of nick knacks from the turn of the century. Common stuff, but yuppies love it. - You bought antiques from the Rooney Estate?

Ever since her mother died. They were pretty close. She never really gotten over it. - Yeah, sign right here. No they say old man Rooney was into some bizarre shit. You know studyin black magic, stuff like that. My aunt said that he made a pact with Satan. But you know she's kinda crazy herself anyway. - Yeah well we gotta be sensible about these things.

What's the, what's the gag? - It's a science fiction idea. Like the one's you write. - Oh okay, well science fiction rules dude. - Okay a man finds a crystal. And in it he sees an alien landscape. Another world perhaps. What do you think? - [Phil] It's an interesting idea, what happens next? (Ding) (dramatic music) - I'll let ya know. Good day. - Hi. - Can I help ya find anything? - Uh well, maybe you can, I had a little fight with my fiance and I guess I need to get something to make up with her. - Couples tend to have their differences. Key is to work through 'em. Ah, well how bout a broach from turn of the century Poland? - No old jewelry. She likes the new stuff. You married? - Ten years. - Whew ten years, that is a long time. - Since I was a young man.

I thought you'd like it. - Oh that is so sweet. - God I've never seen you lookin so good. - Mmm. - I want you so bad. - I feel so naughty, meeting you on my lunch breaks like this. So close to the wedding. Mmm Sunday, day after tomorrow. About this time. You know where we'll be? Eric. Eric. Sunday. - What? What, what? - You better remember that Sunday is our rehearsal. If you leave me again at the alter, even for a rehearsal I'll kill myself. - You promise. - What? - I'm just kidding, just kidding. I'm not gonna flake out like I did last June and leave you at the alter. I love you, I'll be at the rehearsal, I'll be there okay. - Okay. - I love you an I wanna marry you. (Dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Eric. Eric stop. Eric. (Dramatic music) stop Eric. You're hurting me. - What? - What in the hell is wrong with you? - I'm sorry. I just got a little carried away. I was just really startin to enjoy that. - Well I'm glad you enjoyed it. I have to get back to work. - Oh man. - Don't forget Saturday, we have lunch with my parents. To talk about the rehearsal. - I won't forget, I won't forget. - You promised. - I promise, I promise. 59.5 Pepper road. - You know the place. - Got it, have fun at work. - Have fun here. - Jeez. (Dramatic music) - Thirty's, good. (Dramatic music) (dramatic music) - It's you again. - Hello Crystal. - You like your private lap dances huh? - Yes I do, I like 'em. God you are lookin good. You are so beautiful tonight. Lookin sexy, as usual. (Dramatic music) So beautiful. You know what, why don't you just turn the music off. I just wanna look at ya. - What's wrong big guy, don't you have a girlfriend at home? Somebody you can talk to? - Yeah I uh, got a fiance. - Oh, so what do you keep comin here for? Won't she put out? - Yeah she puts out. I'm just lookin for somethin more. But its her parents who put so much pressure on me. To be their idea of a son in law but, I just wanna be myself. - And who are you? - I dunno. I know I'm not their idea what I wanna be. I just want somethin more before I take the big plunge. - More. - What do you mean more? - You know, sexually. I wanna experience somethin, dark and forbidden. Like what's in this postcard. Look at her. God, one night with her. Just one night with her. I mean I could then be content with the same woman for the rest of my life. - That woman in this post card had gotta be a hundred years old. Or dead by now. - You know what I mean. I just wanna taste what I've missed. Before it all goes away. - And you come here to find it? - It's a start. - Look honey, what I can offer you here is a naked dance for 20 bucks. For 30 you can get yourself off. For 40 we can both get naked and I'll dance on top of you but no touching. Anything over 40 would be considered a tip and any further negotiations would be considered illegal. And I'd have to call the manager. - Crystal sorry. I think I gotta go. - Hey, stop. Look, I'm sorry. My advice to you. - What's that? Go home to your fiance. Be happy that somebody loves you. It's a lot more than a lot of us get, trust me. - Thanks Crystal. - Dirty chiseling little pervert. - I couldn't believe it, she wanted her dress in mauve, the entire wedding is in powder blue. Everywhere you look, and she wants mauve? So I told her forget it, she's out. - Good for you dear. - Yeah. - Blue really is the right choice. - Oh yes. Yes. Yes. - Wise boy. - Yeah an he has good taste too. - Fuck me. - Eric. - What did you say young man? - Huh? What? - Just now, what did you say? - Uh I said, duck meat. Duck meat yeah, it's real good. Duck meat. - Well thank you. - Eric. Come with me. I'd like to have a word with you. Alone. - You mean like a father future son-in-law kinda thing? - Something like that. - So. - You better be at the rehearsal on Sunday and at the wedding next week. If you break my little girl's heart again I'll ruin you in this town. - Come on Mr. Combs, alright. - Call me Wendell. Do you think I'm joking? Do you realize how well connected I am in this town? - Hey what makes you think? Of course I'll be at the rehearsal alright. Did I ever say otherwise? - You forget I know your track record. That innocent act won't wash. Look if it were up to me, I'd say go ahead walk, great. You only want her for her money and her body anyway. I can't imagine what she sees in you. You have a pathetic dead end job. You're course and uneducated and frankly I don't think you can be trusted. But for some reason, my little girl wants you. Really really wants you, and my little girl always gets what she wants. So you better be at the rehearsal and you better be at the wedding. - I've changed Mr. Combs. Wendell, I'm totally committed to her, totally. We're made for each other. An I don't even think about other women. - Don't lie to me punk. I saw you coming out of that strip club yesterday afternoon. - You saw? What the hell were you doin over there anyways? - I was driving by asshole. Don't you even bring my character into this. - Hey I'm young alright. I'm not married to her yet. I've got some needs. And besides you know what goes on in that club. There's no touching, it's just all fantasy anyways. - Fantasy, that's right, fantasy. That's your problem son. Here's the cold truth. You are going to marry my daughter. And you are going to come to work for me inspecting homes. And you are never going to look at another naked woman again besides her or you'll be unemployable in this town. Got me, I'm gonna marry Virginia because her and I want each other, not because what you say. And I'm not gonna be some home inspector. That's not my future, alright. I'm gonna create my own future with Virginia. I'll be able to take care of her, alright, got it. - Come back I'm not through with you. - What the hell is this? - Hey it's mine. - You little pervert. - Fuck you asshole. - What did you say to me young man? (Dramatic music) - Oh god. - What the hell's the matter with you? - Did daddy talk to you about maybe working for him? Eric, what's the matter? - Are you leaving? - Where are you going? Sit down. - I gotta go. I forgot, I gotta do something for my boss. I gotta go. - Eric. (Dramatic music) - Jesus Christ, what are you showing me. What are you all about? Are you real? Am I killin my in laws and Virginia? Do I want you deep down inside? What is this all about? What? Holy shit. (Growling) (dramatic music) (growling) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - No no no. What the hell do you want? What? This? You want this? Ahh. (Dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - It's you, how? You're real? - You wanted to learn what I have to teach. So I brought you hear to me. - Am I dead? - You think this is hell? - Not hardly. You're my fantasy, this has gotta be heaven. Ahh. What are you doin? Don't. What the hell? Ahh ahh, god dammit stop it. I'm locked into this stuff, what are you doin? - There is reward in the pain, pleasure, excitement. Unlike anything you've had with your safe little fuck back home. - I know I fantasize about you. You're my dream girl. But I don't know about this. - It's too late now. You will learn to thank me. - Ahh. What's that, no no, don't. Get me out of here, no. What are you doin? Ahh. God dammit. Ahh ahh ahh. Ahh. Stop it. Ahh. Stop. Ahh. Ahh. Ahh ahh, stop. Ahh. - Feel the pain, find the pleasure. - Stop. Ahh Ahh ahh stop. Ahh ahh, no no. Ahh ahh ahh Ahh. Ahh ahh. No. Ahh. Yeah, yeah again, come on. Yes. - Ahh, you see what I mean now. The pleasure in the pain. - What next, come on. Come on. - Now perhaps you would like what you really came for. - I don't understand. - Do you want me? - Yes. Yes I want you, come on. Yes. Yes. Oh oh oh. - What would you give for it? - Anything. Anything. - Anything? - Anything. - There's a price for what I have to show you. You will know the limits of ecstasy. Then you'll be ready to return home to your little concubine contentment. - What place do I have to drag ya to? - I wish to borrow your body, for 24 hours. - What? - Do you know how long I have been in this one room? I long to walk the world of the living things once more. If even for a short time. If you give me this, I will show you all. - What's gonna happen to my body? What? I don't get this. - You will remain here, in my body. One short day. - I don't know, i don't know about my body, I just don't know. Ahh, okay okay, yes. Yes anything I'll do it. Yes, okay. Oh god I want you. Yes. (Moaning) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - What's happening? Where am I? What is this place? Oh god, I remember now. The girl from the post card. She was here. Oh my god. What was it she wanted me to do? I remember now, she wanted to trade bodies with me. That's it. For one day. Holy shit. It was all real, all of it. (Moaning) This could be interesting. I could see how the other half lives. (Moaning) Man I'm good. I have a fucking good body. Check this out. Alright. (Dramatic music) Lemme see your face. (Dramatic music) Ahh. (Dramatic music) - Oh hello. (Screaming) - What's going on, what are you doing here? What are you doing? - What the hell's going on? You son of a bitch. Ahh. - Thank you for the vacation. I had a lovely time. And now. I want my body back. - Oh shit. Where am I? Jesus. Oh yeah, yeah yeah, oh I remember. That had to be a dream. That had to be a dream. Shit. God dammit, I gotta go to the wedding rehearsal. Shit. (Moaning) - I had an accident. That's it, I was unconscious. I would a been there but I couldn't help it. She's just gonna have to forgive me. I'm ready for it now. I'm ready to settle down and take care of her. Raise kids. I love her. I really really love her. (Dramatic music) Virginia, Virginia. Sorry I'm late baby. Sorry. Virginia. Virginia. Virginia. Oh no. (Dramatic music) Virginia, Virginia? Virginia, no. Oh god. No no no. (Dramatic music) - [Dispatcher] You have reached 9-1-1. All of our operators are busy, please hold. 9-1-1. - Yeah, yeah I wanna report a murder. A triple murder. - [Dispatcher] Three murders? - Yeah. (Mumbles) - 5925 Pepper drive. - [Dispatcher] Do you have any knowledge about who committed these murders? - Yeah. I think I did it. (Dramatic music) - What is the matter with you? Why are you hanging on to this piece of common crystal? - I just wanted to get it appraised first. - Appraised? It's crystal. Cheap everyday common crystal. I try and try to teach you, but you just do not get any better in this business. (Dramatic music) - What are you? What are you? We've seen it many times, and it has seen him. Although attempts at photographing it have been disappointing. - [Phil] How does he feel about the aliens? - Well he feels they have some sort of a understanding. The creature, being whatever it is, comes around every now and then to, just for a few seconds. Just to say hi. - Huh, this is getting to be a pretty wild story. Does it still steal the food? - He brings food for it now. The crystal has learned that when he snaps his fingers there's food to pick up. - Oh that sounds cool. When do I see the first draft? - Well I'm kinda stuck. I'm having trouble motivating something. - What? - Well in order to make the story work, the alien needs to steal food from him. But to make it pay off, I have to figure out why the alien only takes food to study in the first place. - It doesn't communicate with him at all then? - Nothing at all. Nothing. He's tried everything he knows. - I'll tell ya one thing though, it's gotta change him too. As to why it's just the food, well I'll have to think about that. I'll give ya a call. - No, no, I'll call you. The wife. - Oh your wife, yeah sure man, I know how women are. That's why I live alone. - Phil, I'll call you back in a few days when I get the pulse. I gotta go. (Dramatic music) hello. Hello again. (Dramatic music) Tell me things. How do you live, talk to me. (Dramatic music) Why do you always run off? (Playful music) - What is it with you and that crystal? Every time I walk into the room. - Uh was just tidying up. - You're always just tidying up. - How did the auction go? - Usual kitch. I picked up a few things for quick sale. - That's nice. - I've been in one of my moods haven't I? - You've been thinkin about your mother again I'm sure. - Yes but I haven't been very nice have I? - No you're probably still grieving. - You so understanding. (Dramatic music) oh I ran into Brenda Divane today. Hold on. You won't believe what she's got going. Got a hall and everything. A new age fair. Fortune tellers. Spacey earth girls. And crystals. Can you believe it? But it got me to thinking. I put my best face for Brenda, and talked up your big crystal to her. And you won't believe what she gave me for it. Where is it? - I put it away. I was tidying. - She gave me three hundred dollars for it. Find it.. Who can see it from down there? Brenda's coming by this afternoon to pick it up. Would you make sure that it stays here please. - Alright. - I don't understand what's going on with you Winnie. I don't know what's goin on in your head.. - Would you please stop nagging me? Huh, stop nagging me. - I was just worried about you okay. Sorry for caring. (Dramatic music) (ding) (dramatic music) - Good day Winston, how have you been? - You can't have it. - I beg your pardon? - The crystal, it's not for sale. - What do you mean? I already gave Alice 300 dollars for it. - I don't care, it's not leaving the store. - Of course it is. Stand aside, let me have it. - It's not leaving the store. - Really? Is Alice here? Hello Alice. - [Alice] Winnie, what's going on out there? - Just tidying up dear. (Dramatic music) - Oh my god. Oh my god. (Ding) (playful music) - Close the fuckin door. My hair. - Hey last stop a the day right Harry? - Yeah last stop. - Yeah cause I am hungry. I cannot wait to get some lunch. - Lunch, lunch is good. - Shut up, shut the fuck up both of yas. Geez. (Playful music) - It's you, good day gentlemen. - Yeah. You was expecting us I bet, huh? - Fuckin a. - Shut up, shut up both of yas. So uh, Winnie, how's business? - Okay I guess, we've been getting by, not badly. - Well I suppose you know why we're here? - I assume it's for the same reason you come every month. (Laughing) - Yeah that's right. It's just that, well I enjoy askin ya. - You got your shop in Mr. DiCaprio's territory son. You gotta pay for that privilege. - Yeah, insurance. - Shut up, didn't I tell both of yas to shut up? And that means shut up. - Sorry Harry. - Yeah sorry Harry. - Geez. So. - Hmm? - The money stupid. - Its in an envelope in my wife's room. I'll be right back. - Well make it snappy alright. Fuckin moron. - A customer. - What the fuck is that? - What the fuck? - You messed up my hair. - My apologies. Can I help you? - Yes I hope so. I've come a very long way. I've been told that you recently purchased some items from the Rooney estate. - Yeah, yeah that's true we did. - The Magus Rooney had in his possession, a certain item which is of great value to my people. Something he would never part with. But now that he's gone. - Which item was that? - Yeah, that's what I'd like to know. An what makes it so fuckin valuable? - It is a ring of gold. The head of a beast with a hoop in it's mouth. - Here it is. Is that it? - Hey, gimme. Check it out boys. That's a pretty nice ring. - It is not for adornment. - That's a real nice ring you got there Harry. - That's freakin beautiful. So, what's the story on this here ring? - Well my wife just had it appraised. It's a tribal worship ring from some south sea island. It's a symbol of the predator in man. That ring through the mouth shows that the wolf is still a slave to his own predatory nature. - And it is the link to the magic of our former days of glory. We are weak and shackled without it. Now at last it can be possessed again, and we can be strong. - Is that right? So real gold I suppose? - Absolutely, of a very high grade actually. Hand made from stone kilns. - Hmm. So how much? - This ring was stolen from my people many decades ago. To you it is only worth the value of the metal. To us it is everything. - I ask you, how much. - 100. - Sir, I came to you first asking about the ring. It'll only bring ruin and bad luck to any other hands that it may fall into. - If what you say is true, there's gotta be at least half a ounce of gold in here. So why so cheap? - I don't really like the ring. It makes me uncomfortable. I just assume not have it. - Tribal curses I suppose. Oh yeah, like I'm fuckin scared or something. Ooh. - Booga boooga booga. - 100 bucks you say? - I will give you two. - It wouldn't be a good idea for me to refuse these gentlemen anything. - I will give you 500. - I'll give ya 50. Ya take it, and ya like it. Hey boys, looks like I just got myself a brand new ring here. - Oh nice Harry. - What the fuck are you doin? - You let go a him. - What the fuck do you think you're doin huh? Let go of him. - Let the fuck go. - I merely wanted to touch it again one last time. - Get the fuck outta here. - Yeah get the fuck out. - Your regrets on this matter will be great. And you have not seen my last. - The only thing I regret, is havin seen your ugly face. Now beat it. - You better move along there spooky. - Yeah, bye bye now. (Ding) - I'll go get the money. - Now that would be a good idea. Fuckin asshole. - Wait a minute, geez. Holy shit. - What's the matter boss? - Harry, what's wrong? - This ring, it's, it's burnin or something. It's like it's burnin my fuckin hand. Oh man. - What do we do? What what what what? What do we do, what do we do? What's wrong, what's wrong boss? - Shut up, shut up. Wait, I think it's goin away. I think its leavin. Oh, oh my god. Here help me up for god's sake. Geez. What gives here? What's wrong with this son of a bi-. This son of a bitch won't come off. I'm sayin the fuckin ring won't come off. Here, have the mutha fucker, get it off. - Got it, I got it boss. - Ya fuckin moron. Lemme do it, lemme do it. - Take it off Johnny O. Get it. Fuckin incompetent idiots. Just fuckin forget it. - Here's your money. - Gimme the money.. An I'll see ya again. Same time next month. Now listen boys, I wanna have some fuckin lunch here. Because I'm fuckin starvin, let's get goin, come on, let's go. Hey the draft, will you watch my fuckin hair? (Playful music) - That was so fuckin great the way you screwed with that cocky cook boss. Know he wouldn't get away with it. Man that was fuckin great. - Shut up. Just shut the fuck up. Listen ya guys are drivin me crazy. An you keep lookin too if you want some of the same. Asshole. Now come on, hurry it up, I'm hungry here. I want some fuckin meat alright. Geez I feel like shit. I gotta get somethin to eat. (Dramatic music) - Hey, what's this shit? I said, rare, this is barely pink. Now come here, ya take this back an ya get it right. I wanna taste blood or I'm gonna taste your blood. Fuckin incompetent pig. - But boss I thought you liked your steak medium rare? - Shut up alright. Now listen yous guys. This time, after we have lunch, we'll make the drop at DiCaprio as usual. Except, this time you guys wait in the car. - Wait in the car boss? But we always go inside. - Yeah. - Not this time you don't. Ya see DiCaprio's men are away on a raid. Get me? He don't trust you guys. He gets nervous when you fellas are around him. He said he wants me to go in alone. Alright? - But Mr. DiCaprio knows us. - What are ya talkin about? You two assholes aren't even made. You're not connected like me. So when I say wait in the car, that means wait in the car alright? - Whatever you say boss you got okay. - Alright. - Whatever you say. - Okay. - I hope that this is rare enough for you. - Yeah. Now that's more like it. My compliments to the chef. I'm feelin better already. This looks fuckin great. This is just what I've been wantin all day. Mmmmm.

For example, say if you were to make me one a your trusted soldiers, one of your, your top guys, it could all be better. It could be different for me Mr. DiCaprio. - Harry, it ain't that easy. See I like you, but, Harry you're not the right blood. You understand what I'm tellin ya? Blood Harry, blood. You're not the right blood.

I wouldn't give it to her even if she did. - What is it with you an that rock? Why do you always hide it from me? - Please go to bed. - Don't tell me what to do. Mom always said you told me what to do. You let yourself go. You tell me what to do. You don't spend time with me. She was right. Point by point. - And you're just like her. - And what is that supposed to mean? - Means you're a predatory cunt who lives to shred my soul. Until I feel lower than a maggot in shit. I am keeping this fucking crystal. If you don't like it, get out. - You put this freakin rock above our marriage? You're even worse then mom ever said. - You're mother was a fucking cow. I'm glad she's dead, the world's a better place without her. - Bastard.

Alice, I'm sorry. I'm sorry Alice. What did I do? What did I do for you? For you? - She always said I was a fool to get mixed up with you. Can't hold a job. Head in the clouds. Don't even know what you wanna do, much less do it. These were all wrong. Even you. You're even worse than mom ever said. Than mom ever said. (Ringing) - Cade's Antiques. - Winston dude. Just finished writin my pages for the day an kickin back. Hope it's not too late. - Not at all. - So spill it, did ya get the pulps. - Yeah they're right here. - That is excellent. I'll come by tomorrow afternoon for 'em. - Okay. (Dramatic music) - Oh an Winston, I've been thinkin about your crystal viewing alien story. - Yeah. - Yeah, check this out. What if the, landscape was an alien civilization in ruins? Terrible famine. These interplanetary probe crystals were sent out in more prosperous times for scientific reasons. And now they're the only means for the aliens to obtain food. They obsessed on interplanetary charity. - You mean they're just hungry? - Sure maybe, why not? There's just one hitch that bothers me. - What's that? - This crystal, if it could move actual objects, isn't it logical that it could also send something here? - Yeah I guess. - Hasn't that ever occurred to you? - Well not until just now. So tell me, what if the crystal sent back the remains of a meal, even though it never has before? - Maybe they're sayin that's what they like to eat. Send more. - Oh Jesus. Oh shit, what have I done? - What? What's goin on dude? - Jesus Christ, what have I done? - You lost me Winston. (Dramatic music) Winston what the hell's going on? - Oh my god Phil, it's eating flesh. They have a taste for human flesh. - Winston, hey, hey what's goin on man? - What have I done? - What's there with you? What is it? (Screaming) (dramatic music)
