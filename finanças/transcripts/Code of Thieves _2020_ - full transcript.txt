I'm a little bored. These niggas took the money and still killed my dawg. - How you know that? - Cuz we was hitting that Lick together last night.

Hanging off the ground legs dangling. I'm fucked up. This motherfucker Bow breaks another window, goes back in the house and pushes me up out that basement. same time the homeowner came home and caught him. Bow's like man fuck it man keep it run.
