I just want to get to Madrid Is it about Charly? Why Charly? A bottle of whisky to room 311, please Thank you I'll enjoy this night To the beach I want to go swimming We didn't think you'd come anymore Did you have a pleasant trip? Perhaps I'll have your luggage brought in Francesca Farnese My name is Jackie Let's not stand in the sun Mr Polonsky is on set Would you like a drink? Franco will show you to your rooms We drove all night Please take up the suitcases But I wouldn't mind a drink Polonsky is directing today He fired the director And the new one from Hollywood hasn't arrived We only have Gin and Tonic They all drink it, I don't know why It's the drink on this production If he drinks it, I ought to as well Here he is Let me tell you, never make film. I'm a wreck. You've the good life, lying in the shade, thinking up pretty stories We need to talk, I want you around here You can have my rooms. Jackie, I'm moving down here Whatever you want, just ask Jackie. Jackie, that's Evers We've met How is Elsa I dream of her every night She will be a fabulous Cynthia Who's this girl, hire her right away Your discovery, Evers? Promise me that you'll have dinner with me Ok Kovacs has been waiting with his attorney all morning These directors always think of their next cheque And never of their next shot Please excuse me See you tonight It's pretty hectic here You'll quickly get used to it Be honest, Evers, books are written not to be read But so that they're made into a film, is that not so? Your novel is great, Jackie told me all about it, she read it So she claims, at least I read it in a single night It is a ravishing read Where the devil would I find the time to read 1200 pages? What I want is to see the film, and I want to be the one to make it For all those who bought the book, but have no time to read it It is my goal that every written word will be made into film one day The larger your cheque The more eager will be my consent Don't leave me hanging, write the script We will add a part for Francesca Nobody is safe from you, I guess My only wish is that everybody feels welcome We don't even have to change the name Tell me about America America will adore you Arrange for some screen tests I will be directing Good morning, I'll drive you to the hair appointment Mr Polonsky's orders? He gave me exact instructions how he wants you to look No protest, understood? Mr Polonsky wouldn't like that I'll be making my own film next year Sylvia, a girl who wants to adapt to her society But is rejected You would really fit the part I'm only doing this to learn the craft I've been astonished at how naive these people are Polonsky really does believe that he is an idealist Can you lose that car there? The Cadillac? Sure You watch too many movies What's Elsa's opinion? She's on a shoot in Rome next week She's busy Sometimes I think of her But then I notice that I'd forgotten her Believe me, when I see Francesca I forget my five ex-wives She's mine, is that clear? You're a beast Don't start with that again It is not nice of you to keep her identity from me Am I treating you badly? The cheque is signed, just sign your contract If I write the script, my next novel won't be ready by the autumn And my publisher is just as touchy as you It's clear he only wants to exploit you Why should I be the one to write the script? Because I've grown very fond of you Sign it "It's characteristic of Polonsky's method" "That everyone working with him loves him like a father" I read that in the press today It's no secret Polonsky demands much, Polonsky pays much Please sign And here That's yours Have the pen as a keepsake I need the money So I can kidnap Francesca He will like you like this Is that so important? Is there another exit? Behaviour like this will not get you into film Could you pull up the car, please We gave him the slip earlier Where's Evers? You didn't get your hair done... - What's going on? - It's futile What is futile? Francesca, you will be my ruin, what happened to your hair? Is there nobody I can count on? I told her Jackie, get us a hairdresser right away Do I have to do everything myself? Don't waste your time Francesca, don't do anything you don't want Be a good child, you promised me this Nobody loves me, they're all against me I signed the contract We will have the money tomorrow We can leave here I can't stand these damn film people I don't want to leave I don't want you to do those screen tests Perhaps I like it They're vampires They'll only suck you dry Can I get one, too? Do you love me? I can see that something is troubling you A car was following me today The black Cadillac? Yes Do you know who it is? No I'll call the police Don't call, perhaps I only imagined it all Have you ever been to a psychiatrist? No You mustn't leave me alone from now on I always imagined Cynthia like that Odd that I only realize that now What's going on with Francesca? She's not feeling well Evers, you can tell me I think she's afraid But I don't know of what, she's hiding something - She hardly leaves the house anymore - Who is she? Where's she from, what did she do before you met her? It sounds foolish, but I know nothing about her When I ask her she says nothing You're too weak Beat her, you may find out a lot that way I've the impression that she may be married And that her husband won't release her We will find out, Jackie call Phil There's nothing Phil won't find out Those are Gestapo methods But they work Whose car is that? Which? The black Cadillac Polonsky has his girls picked up from the airport in that Not bad Pay him, get rid of him, in NYC l can find dozens of production managers Evers, I want to kidnap Francesca, where is the child? Supergirl, get dressed You have to accompany me to the airport, I'm flying to NYC That's a no-go If she's not here I can't work Do not fear great master, Jimmy will drive her back Right, Jimmy? You let me go this quickly? I love you You've to rush, Mr Polonsky We would make a big star of you Giant publicity Everyone would know your face when the film is released Can you take me with you? When the film is finished we'll travel around, you'll meet some people Who're important for your future career I don't have that much time I'm only going to NYC for a few hours I've to convince an old friend to lend me a few million I'd like to see the White House The White House will want to see you Do you know the president? I know people who work with him on a daily basis What people? You strange creature, why would a pretty girl like you be interested in politics? I'm sad Nobody loves me Nobody loves me You have little time You will meet him There are people who see him as the next president When will I meet him? Take care Someone's here Sit over here Do you think I'm stupid? You say nothing I know You're all silent But I won't let it go on I can understand you Who is it? Who? - Where were you this afternoon? - I was here You're lying! You mustn't speak to me like this You're getting on my nerves I will explain everything Soon Bolivia did not issue that passport A forgery? No It's all in order The stamp, the signature But it was never issued That's never happend to me before I can't explain It's a contradiction What other contradictions are there? Are you certain she really exists? No family, friends Not a trace to show That she's lived at all Except for one She's been meeting someone Lover? Not likely They never meet in hotel rooms Usually on a busy street They exchange a few words I've found out That Ms Farnese feels she's being followed She constantly seems startled by something A car turning a corner A young man approaching her Does that happen often? Naturally, she's an attractive individual Did you find out who it is she meets? He has eluded me He knows how to vanish into thin air You're getting old Perhaps it's the heat It doesn't agree with me Have you any information that would justify your expense? It would have to be a case of blackmail Thanks for your effort Shall I continue the investigation? No Until next time Bye She fell out of heaven, that's the only answer I'm going back to Munich, I hate it here And Francesca? Do with her whatever you want Will you come to Paris? I'm hosting a party this weekend Quimby will be there The senator and future president of the US Good friend of mine Francesca wanted to meet him Didn't you know that? I should have stayed in Rome Don't despair, Polonsky promised you the part Who is this Farese? Hi I can't live without you any longer Liar Good evening You've met, I'm sure Not nice of you to leave me, bad publicity Your place beside me is always there for you How's your novel coming? Page 1001 Or whatever I hope there's a part in it for the girls Get me a drink, please - I'll get some food - I'll go, too Excuse me, darling I didn't invite them Rather rude of you, Polonsky Looks bad, startled me Thanks You promised the senator would be here Lucky Quimby, all women love him They'll elect him president Quimby for president? I think I can tell a jet from a UFO Elsa saw it, too, she can confirm it Yes, there was something up there But I'm ignorant about UFOs It was about 8pm, it came flying from behind St Peter's I can't believe it Here he is Come Francesca, I'll introduce you I'm staying at the Hotel Saint George I've to talk to you Do me a favour, leave me alone Not like that Watch it If possible Can you understand her? I've given up trying Are you mad at me? I wouldn't survive it I always knew you were a pig Please don't say that, you know how sensitive I am Your manners are awful Why? Is he more inventive in bed that I, or what is it? If he writes the script in this state it might even become a film Children, stop fighting, do old Polonsky a favour What has she done to you? Done? Why is she even here? Polonsky didn't invite her - Elsa doesn't need an invitation - Ok I'd be more worried about what my girlfriend was doing with the senator I want to leave, come You killed him I don't know him He wanted to break in When he spotted us he made a movement I thought he was armed Are you the author of Cynthia? Would you like a dedication? He knows you from Paris-Match Mme Farnese is playing the main part in an American film We regret to inform you that you have to remain at our disposal Goodbye I will explain everything I was born on the third planet of the Alpha Centauri system Conditions are similar to those here on earth We are perhaps 50 years ahead of you Or 100 I don't know Our government was observing earth long before my time We are now ready to make contact with earth That is why for years A struggle for power has taken place The current government Wants to establish peaceful relations with earth But in recent months another party has become powerful They want war They want to colonise earth As you did in earlier historical times Our government is losing power I am the president's daughter I was part of an expedition that Was to warn earth of an impending attack We were supposed to fly to Washington first Our spaceship would have convinced people But we had to deviate from our coordinates We crashlanded in Germany Upon impact Our ship exploded I was the only one who got out via parachute All I could rescue was my Bolivian passport Do you now understand why I had to get to America? I don't have much time The party knows I'm here Those in the black Cadillac are after me The man you shot He warned me about them I didn't know he had survived He remained hidden in order not to impede my progress An hour ago he told me the party was about to take power I've failed The senator I told this story Thinks I'm insane I don't expect you'll believe me But if you love me even a little I beg you, come with me to Moscow It's the only hope Otherwise there'll be a catastrophe And the only hope That the party would desist If they knew earth had been warned You've read too many comics Shit Taxi! Orly airport, hurry Hurry Anyone could be one of them We'll fly to Munich My car is in the garage It's late How long did I sleep? Two hours Are you feeling better? Haven't you got anything that can make me forget? No I don't use that stuff You need rest You don't believe me I believe everything, my supergirl I'm not I came back only an hour ago, have you had breakfast? If I eat anything I'll be sick I'm finished Really I know everything You don't know Quimby told Polonsky Who told Elsa who told me The girl is insane She belongs in an institution You don't say I've always said so Criminal or insane You don't take sugar? Elsa has filed for divorce She's going to play the main part in Polonsky's film He's no longer interested in Francesca She spooked him You know how he is If he gets scared off there's no hope And what if Francesca is right? In that case? We can't comprehend it Do you comprehend it? There's at least a chance she's from another planet Don't you read the news? Tell that to the police They'll be visiting you soon For some enquiries You've become a suspect Why didn't you stay in Paris? Was the man identified? It was him Promise me Yes You'll end it with her Yes You regret that you hit Elsa Yes And you state that Francesca is not worth a ruined reputation Ok She has never been to The third planet of the Alpha Centauri system Yes I don't really like you I've Never liked you You're A revolting pig But You're a somewhat regular human being Damn chair Alright, Charly? I've to go see her Do whatever you want Get lost Subtitles for KG (2015) by stefflbw
