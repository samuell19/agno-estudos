YES, WE HAVE TO GO TO LONG ISLAND, SO I'LL PHONE THE AGENCY LATER, IF YOU DON'T MIND. OH, NO, INDEED. THE BABY'S AWAKE NOW, MRS. CHARLES. [KNOCKS] I DON'T WONDER.

HIYA, CREEPS. GEE, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU, NICK. YEAH? YEAH, EVEN IF IT DID COST ME ONE OF THE PRETTIEST JOBS I EVER LINED UP FOR MYSELF. YOU KNOW, I BEEN TRYING TO GET MY HANDS ON THOSE KEYS FOR THE LAST 2 WEEKS. WELL, THAT'S THAT. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? NICKY, WE MUST HURRY. HOW ARE YOU, MRS. CHARLES? I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU. HOW ARE YOU? OH, I'M FINE. MOMMY, THIS IS CREEPS BINDER. REMEMBER? CREEPS? CREEPS--CREEPS! YOU REMEMBER? NICK SENT ME UP THE RIVER. OH. IT'S NICE YOU DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. WHY SHOULD I? GEE, IT TOOK A GENIUS TO OUTSMART ME. DON'T WANT TO TOUCH ME? REALLY, CREEPS. YOU SHOULDN'T RUN HIM DOWN LIKE THAT. OH, NO, MRS. CHARLES. [RUFF RUFF] NICK, HE'S DOING SOMETHING. WELL, I GUESS I WON'T NEED THIS ANYMORE. OH, DO YOU MIND? NO, MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME. Nora: WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? ASTA'S BONE. SHOULDN'T LEAVE IT AROUND. YOU'RE OLDER THAN HE IS. YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BETTER. [RUFF RUFF] Creeps: GEE. A BABY. Nick: YES, YES. YOURS? YES. WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW? IS IT A BOY? CERTAINLY. HEY, KITCHY-KITCH. WHAT IS IT HERE? SAY HELLO TO MR. BINDER. CAN HE TALK? A FEW WORDS. WELL, I OUGHT TO RATE ONE OF THEM. HOW ABOUT IT? COME ON, SEE? HUH? Nick: WHAT'S THE MATTER? I WAS JUST TRYING TO THINK WHO HE LOOKS LIKE. ANYONE I KNOW? I GOT IT-- IT'S THE MISSIS. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU HAD A KID? WELL, YOU KNOW. OH, NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT HIM. HE'S ALL RIGHT. YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF THE MONKEYS I SEE. AND THE FATHERS ARE TAKING BOWS. FEEL BETTER NOW, MOMMY? HOW OLD IS HE? HE'LL BE A YEAR NEXT MONDAY. MONDAY? WE'LL THROW HIM A PARTY. I'LL GET THE MOB TO BRING THEIR KIDS OVER AND WE'LL THROW HIM A PARTY. WHAT DO YOU SAY? WELL, UH... WE HAVE TO GO TO THE COUNTRY. YES. WE DON'T QUITE KNOW HOW LONG-- IT'S A DATE, THEN. I'LL GET MY BROTHER TO LET ME BRING HIS KIDS OVER. HE'S GOT 2 OF THE CUTEST LITTLE-- WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND-- NOW LEAVE IT TO CREEPSIE, MRS. CHARLES. I'LL THROW YOU A BABY PARTY YOU NEVER SEEN THE LIKE OF. KOOTCHY-KOOTCHY. YOUR FATHER HAS SUCH LOVELY FRIENDS. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THINK NOTHING OF IT. GLAD TO DO IT. Nick: HOW MUCH FURTHER IS IT? WELL, THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE WAYS UP THE HILL TO THE LEFT. IT'S ABOUT A MILE AROUND TO THE GATES. HEY! STOP THE CAR! WE BETTER NOT, MR. CHARLES. STOP THE CAR, I TELL YOU! ALL RIGHT... Nora: WHAT HAPPENED? YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME IF I TOLD YOU. COME BACK HERE, ASTA. Nora: WHAT ARE YOU HUNTING FOR? I THOUGHT I KNEW, BUT NOW I'LL TAKE ANYTHING I CAN FIND. WHAT IS IT? NOT A THING. I WISH YOU'D TELL ME WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHAUFFEUR? HE WAS SCARED. NOW I AM. SCARED OF WHAT? I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. THERE ISN'T ANYTHING. THAT'S WHAT I'M SCARED OF. MOMMY, LET'S GO BACK TO NEW YORK. WE CAN'T DO THAT. COLONEL MacFAY'S EXPECTING US. WELL, THEN, LET'S GO SOMEPLACE AND GET A DRINK AND THINK IT OVER. WELL, THE NEAREST DRINK IS MacFAY'S. MOMMY, YOU'RE A STUBBORN WOMAN. WOULD YOU, UH... MIND OPENING THE GATES? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE'RE BRINGING BACK COLONEL MacFAY'S CAR. I SEE THAT, ALL RIGHT, BUT HOW DO I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT? UH...THIS IS THE CHARLES FAMILY. NICK CHARLES AND FAMILY? ANYONE CAN SAY THAT. THEN SUPPOSE YOU SAY IT TO COLONEL MacFAY? THERE'S A PARTY DOWN HERE. HE SAYS HIS NAME IS CHARLES. YEAH? WELL, HE LOOKS TO ME LIKE A POOL PARLOR DUDE. OK, IF YOU SAY SO. ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. HEY, THERE! JUST A MINUTE. JUST A MINUTE. IT'S ALL RIGHT, WE'VE BEEN ANNOUNCED. THOSE ARE MY FEET. Guard: WHAT'S THE IDEA OF THE KID? WELL, WE HAVE A DOG, AND HE WAS LONESOME. THAT WAS THE IDEA, WASN'T IT, MOMMY? Nora: WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT? YOU'LL FIND OUT. I'LL GO WITH YOU TO SEE THAT YOU ARRIVE SAFE. COME IN, COME IN. YOU, MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL FOR ONCE AND BRING IN THE BAGS. I'M MRS. BELLAM, THE HOUSEKEEPER. WE'RE SORRY WE'RE LATE, BUT WE LOST YOUR CHAUFFEUR. OH, BLESS YOUR HEART, THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT. THINK NO MORE ABOUT IT. COME THIS WAY. BUT ALL THESE GUARDS AND EVERYTHING-- IS THE COLONEL ALL RIGHT? OH, BLESS YOU, YES. HE'S WAITING DINNER. BUT THEN, YOU NEEDN'T HURRY. IF YOU'LL JUST FOLLOW ME. Colonel: I WON'T HAVE IT! I'M NOT A CHILD! I WON'T PUT UP WITH IT! WHAT'S THE USE IN SAYING WE WON'T PUT UP WITH IT WHEN WE ARE PUTTING UP WITH IT? IT'S A LOT OF APRIL FOOLERY! YOU CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE. I SEEN WHAT I SEEN. IT WAS THE CUBAN. I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO WORRY ANYMORE, SIR. OBVIOUSLY, THE TWO MEN HAD A FALLING-OUT. ONE OF THEM KILLED THE OTHER, SO-- THE OTHER? I'M THE ONE THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE KILLED! FATHER, DEAR, FREDDIE MEANS-- [DOG GROWLING] JESSIE, DOWN! AH, AT LAST. HOW ARE YOU, COLONEL? HOW ARE YOU, MY DEAR? Nick: COLONEL. WASN'T THERE A BODY IN THE ROAD, MR. CHARLES? HE DON'T BELIEVE ME. OH, YES, YES. YOU SEE? A BODY? YES, IT WAS GONE WHEN I WENT BACK. AW, JUST A TRICK. ALL PART OF THE GAME, PART OF THE PLAN TO TERRIFY ME. NOW GO ON, GO ON, GO ON. EVERYBODY BRINGS THESE WILD STORIES TO ME BUT NOBODY TRIES TO HELP ME. WHAT IS IT, COLONEL? NOTHING WRONG WITH NORA'S ESTATE? ESTATE, ESTATE! IS THAT ALL YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT? DOESN'T ANYBODY CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME? FATHER, DEAR, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE DINNER FIRST? THEN YOU CAN TELL THEM ALL ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS. NONE OF US HAVE EVEN MET MR. AND MRS. CHARLES YET. OH, MY ADOPTED DAUGHTER, LOIS. SEEMS AWFUL WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE. YES, DOESN'T IT? OH, AND I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY FIAN-- MR. DUDLEY HORN. Both: HOW DO YOU DO? AND THIS IS MR. COLEMAN, FATHER'S SECRETARY. HOW DO YOU DO? JESSIE, DOWN! DOWN, JESSIE! CHARMED, I'M SURE. LOIS, TAKE THIS DOG OF YOURS OUTSIDE WHERE IT BELONGS. WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS? COME ON. Colonel: INFERNAL NUISANCE. Nora: IT WASN'T HIS FAULT. NICK SMELLS LIKE A DOG. HMM? I MEAN HE SMELLS LIKE ASTA. NOW, ARE YOU READY FOR DINNER? UH, YES, I WOULD LIKE-- OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. NEVER MIND ABOUT WASHING. HERE, FREDDIE. LOCK UP THAT LIQUOR CABINET. BUT MAYBE MR. AND MRS. CHARLES WOULD LIKE A-- MRS. CHARLES DOESN'T DRINK, AND I WANT MR. CHARLES TO HAVE A CLEAR MIND. NOW, WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? I NEVER KNEW SUCH A LOT. AS IF I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ME. HERE YOU ARE, SIR. THANK YOU. TELL THEM TO SERVE DINNER. YES, SIR. GUESS I BETTER GET IT OVER. I WANT TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU. I WANT TO GET YOU WORKING ON THIS. I CAME DOWN HERE TO DISCUSS BUSINESS. NORA'S ESTATE. WELL, THIS IS BUSINESS. NORA'S BUSINESS, YOUR BUSINESS. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE ESTATE IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME. NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. YOU GO ON IN, I'LL SEND THE BABY UPSTAIRS, AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THINGS. DON'T BE LONG. AND PUT THE LIGHTS OUT. NO USE WASTING MONEY. Nick: GETTING ME INTO ANOTHER CASE, HUH? THAT OLD PENNY PINCHER CAN AFFORD THE BEST DETECTIVE IN THE BUSINESS. HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET ONE FOR NOTHING. YOU'RE ABETTING HIM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. NO? THEN WHAT WAS ALL THAT BUSINESS AT THE DOOR? I WAS JUST PICKING HIS POCKET. I HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED TO YOU FOR NOTHING. MOMMY. Colonel: SUPPOSING YOU HAD SOMEBODY WORKING FOR YOU... AND HE DID SOMETHING THEY PUT HIM IN JAIL FOR? HE DID IT, YOU DIDN'T DO IT. YOU EVEN TRIED TO GET HIS SENTENCE CUT DOWN, BUT YOU COULDN'T. WELL, WHEN HE GETS OUT, HE COMES TO YOU AND SAYS IT'S YOUR FAULT. YOUR FAULT? HE WANTS A LOT OF MONEY. AND WHEN YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO HIM, HE SAYS HE HOPES YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE PIGHEADED, BECAUSE HE'S DREAMED TWICE ABOUT YOUR DYING... AND THE THIRD TIME HE DREAMS THINGS, THEY COME TRUE. NOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WELL, I WOULDN'T THINK I'D HAVE TO HURRY UP MY DYING ON HIS ACCOUNT. WAS THIS THE MAN PLAYING DEAD BESIDE THE ROAD? NO, THAT'S HIS SERVANT. THE TWO OF THEM HAVE TERRORIZED THE WHOLE PLACE. HAVE YOU REPORTED THEM TO THE POLICE? I'M NOT ALTOGETHER A FOOL! OF COURSE I HAVE! THEY CAN'T VERY WELL ARREST A MAN JUST BECAUSE HE TOLD YOU HIS DREAM. BUT HE TELLS ME HE'S DREAMING ABOUT ME DYING. I KNOW CHURCH WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT'S A THREAT. CHURCH? PHIL CHURCH. AN ENGINEER. WORKED FOR ME 10 YEARS AGO. AND HE'S BEEN IN JAIL EVER SINCE. YES. AHEM. Nick: UH-HUH... Dudley: YES, HE CUT OUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO. HE'S BEEN LIVING DOWN THE ROAD HERE FOR THE PAST 10 DAYS. YOU THINK HE REALLY MEANS TO KILL YOU? NO, NO, NO! I DON'T THINK HE MEANS TO KILL ME, I KNOW IT! PLEASE, FATHER. MR. CHARLES IS ONLY TRYING TO GET IT STRAIGHT IN HIS MIND. THERE'S NOTHING TO GET STRAIGHT! THE MAN MEANS TO KILL ME, AND I'M ASKING MR. CHARLES NOT TO LET HIM DO IT. THAT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH, ISN'T IT? EVEN FOR MR. CHARLES. NO. COLONEL MacFAY? YES, YES, YES, WELL? THE SWIMMING POOL'S ON FIRE. WHAT?! NICKIE! [MEN SHOUTING] STAY WHERE YOU ARE! ONE MOVE OUT OF YOU, AND I'LL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF THE END OF YOUR NECK! HOLD THEM. KILL HIM IF HE EVEN BATS AN EYE. TOM! TAKE THAT GUN OUT OF MR. CHARLES'S FACE AND STOP BELLOWING. AWFULLY GLAD TO SEE YOU, MR. HORN. IT AIN'T THE RIGHT GUY. Dudley: WHAT IS IT? IT'S THE DOG. JESSIE? YUP. DEAD? YES. THROAT'S CUT. HE WAS A SWELL DOG. THIS IS GOING TO BE TOUGH ON LOIS. FIND ANYTHING? ONLY THEM. THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE NOTHING. DON'T LEAD NOWHERE. THEY'RE FOOTPRINTS, ALL RIGHT. OUR MAN HAD RAGS WRAPPED AROUND HIS FEET. YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM THINGS, MISTER? YES, BACK HOME I'M A BOY SCOUT. Lois: WHAT'S HAPPENED, DUDLEY? WHAT IS IT? IT'S JESSIE. JESSIE? HE'S BEEN KILLED. OH, NO! PLEASE DON'T, DARLING. YOU'D BETTER GO BACK TO THE HOUSE. WHY'D THEY HAVE TO DO AN AWFUL THING LIKE THAT? PLEASE DON'T. FREDDIE, TAKE HER BACK. IS THIS THE KIND OF THING THAT'S BEEN GOING ON? MORE OR LESS. SOME OF IT'S SILLY, BUT IT'S NASTY, TOO. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEHIND ALL THESE TRICKS? WHAT'S CHURCH REALLY UP TO? TRYING TO SCARE THE COLONEL INTO COMING ACROSS WITH SOME MONEY. COULD ANY OF THE PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE BE WORKING WITH HIM? OH, I DON'T THINK SO. SERVANTS AREN'T MUCH GOOD, BUT I IMAGINE THEY'RE HONEST. DOES MacFAY REALLY OWE HIM ANYTHING? NOT THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT. YOU SEE, HIS JOB WAS TO GET RESULTS WITHOUT BOTHERING THE COLONEL WITH TOO MANY OF THE DETAILS. WE WERE TRYING TO PUT OVER A...WELL, LET'S CALL IT A PUBLIC UTILITIES ENTERPRISE, AND SOME OF THE DETAILS WERE PRETTY ILLEGAL, WERE TRACED AS FAR AS CHURCH. BUT NOT AS FAR AS THE COLONEL, EH? THAT'S RIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS, IF EVERYTHING GOES OK, THE COLONEL GETS THE PROFITS. IF NOT, CHURCH GOES TO JAIL. THAT'S ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S YOUR JOB WITH THE COLONEL NOW? SOMETHING LIKE THAT. Lois: HOW COULD THEY DO A HORRIBLE THING LIKE THAT? WHY, I'VE HAD HIM EVER SINCE HE WAS A PUPPY. HOW DO THEY GET IN HERE? THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. HOW DO THEY GET IN? WELL? I'M AFRAID THE BATH HOUSE IS PRETTY BADLY DAMAGED. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE BATH HOUSES OR THE DOGS! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO PROTECT ME? IF THEY CAN GET IN HERE TO DO THIS, THEY CAN GET IN HERE TO DO ANYTHING. YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME, CHARLES. HAVE YOU TRIED TALKING TO CHURCH? YES, BUT IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD. I USED TO WORK UNDER HIM, AND HE SEEMS TO THINK I HAD A HAND IN SENDING HIM UP. HOW ABOUT MAKING A BARGAIN WITH HIM? AFTER ALL, HE DID DO 10 YEARS IN JAIL. I WON'T PAY HIM A PENNY! HE CAN BURN THE HOUSE DOWN BEFORE I PAY HIM A CENT. MAYBE MR. CHARLES IS RIGHT, FATHER. MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU-- I'LL THANK YOU TO KEEP OUT OF THIS. WHEN I WANT YOUR OPINION, I'LL ASK FOR IT. DON'T YOU DARE TALK TO HER THAT WAY! YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL SHE CARES WHETHER YOU LIVE OR DIE. FREDDIE! YOU LITTLE-- YOU CAN'T BULLDOZE ME ANY LONGER. I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE. THAT MAY INTEREST DUDLEY-- BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING TO ME! NOW, LOOK HERE, FREDDIE. I KNOW YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON LOIS, BUT DON'T MAKE ANY CRACKS LIKE THAT. DUDLEY-- WHAT'S THIS? WHAT IF I AM IN LOVE WITH HER? THAT'S NOBODY'S BUSINESS BUT MY OWN. AND IF YOU REALLY CARED FOR HER, YOU WOULDN'T LET THAT OLD MAN TALK TO HER THAT WAY. WHY, SHE'S TOO GOOD FOR YOU. AND FOR YOU, TOO! AND YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER TO FIRE ME--I'M GOING! IS THIS TRUE? HAS THAT YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPER BEEN MAKING UP TO YOU? NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT. HE'S NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT-- AND YOU, DUDLEY-- YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF! LOIS? LOIS! ALL RIGHT, DESERT ME, ALL OF YOU! GO ON, YOU TOO, WHY DON'T YOU GO? COLONEL MacFAY, IT'S JUST THE BABY. TAKE YOUR PRECIOUS BABY AND GO! AND UNDERSTAND, THIS IS THE END! THERE'S THE MINING COMPANY'S REPORTS, THE LUMBER COMPANY, AND THE RAILWAY. THERE YOU ARE. NOW YOU TAKE THEM ON. FROM NOW ON, YOU MANAGE THEM. I'M THROUGH! HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR QUIET WEEKEND? "PRODUCTION OF LUMBER, SEASONALLY ADJUSTED." GOOD HEAVENS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? OH, SURE, SURE. THAT'S, UH... THAT'S THE INDIRECT RATIO BETWEEN THE SALES APPRECIATION AND THE UNREALIZED INVENTORY LOSSES. YOU UNDERSTAND? OH, YES. BUT, NATURALLY, ALLOWANCE HAS TO BE MADE FOR THE MAJOR CYCLICAL DOWNSWING-- YOU GET THAT, OF COURSE. NATURALLY. OH, DO YOU? COURSE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FAIR DEGREE OF ACCURACY BY REFERENCE TO A STRAIGHT-LINE CORRELATION FORMULA. DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BETTER GO AND SEE CHURCH? MOMMY... I'M GOING. [RUFF RUFF] HEY, ASTA! COME HERE! [CLAPS HANDS] THAT'S NOT THAT KIND OF A CAT. NOW, WHAT ARE YOU STICKING YOUR PRETTY NOSE IN HERE FOR, CHUM? SORRY, THE DOOR WAS OPEN. ALL RIGHT... YOU MADE YOUR JOKE. NOW PULL YOUR FREIGHT. GET GOIN'. JUST AS YOU SAY, CHIEF. GOOD EVENING, SIR. MR. CHURCH EXPECTING YOU. OH... YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH COLD, LYING IN DAMP ROADS ON DARK NIGHTS. OH, NO, SIR. I DRESS WARM IN THIS COUNTRY. I'M PHIL CHURCH. HOW DO YOU DO? SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. THIS IS SMITTY. WE CAN TALK IN FRONT OF HER. HI. HOW DO YOU DO? HAVE A DRINK? OH, YES. YES. DUM-DUM! SIT DOWN. GO ON WITH YOUR PACKING, HONEY. YOU BET. GOING AWAY? YEAH, BACK TO CUBA. BE NICE IF YOU COULD GIVE US ALL THE GORY DETAILS FIRST, THOUGH. GORY DETAILS? EH. OH, YOU MEAN THE DEAD DOG AND THE BURNING BATH HOUSE? NO, AFTERWARDS. NOTHING HAPPENED AFTERWARDS. BUT I DREAMED... LOOK, YOU'RE NOT TRICKING ME, ARE YOU? NO. YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD THAT NOTHING HAPPENED AFTERWARDS? MY WORD. HE'S NUTS. IF YOU LISTEN TO HIM, HE'LL HAVE YOU NUTS, TOO. YOU CAN LAUGH IF YOU WANT TO, BUT I DON'T LAUGH AT MY DREAMS. LISTEN...I CAME ALL THE WAY BACK FROM CUBA AFTER THE SECOND ONE TO TRY TO MAKE THE COLONEL SEE REASON BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE. BECAUSE THE THIRD ONE'S THE END ON MY SCHEDULE. WELL... THIS AFTERNOON I HAD THE THIRD DREAM. HOW DOES HE USUALLY DIE IN THESE DREAMS? OH, HE'S... ALL BATTERED UP, HIS THROAT CUT... IT'S ALL KIND OF MESSY. IT'S...JUST THE SORT OF DEATH YOU'D EXPECT THAT SLOB TO HAVE. BE FUNNY IF IT HAPPENED THAT WAY, WOULDN'T IT? NO, IT'S FUNNIER THAT IT DIDN'T. HEY, LOOK--YOU SURE HE'S ALL RIGHT? HOW LONG AGO DID YOU LEAVE HIM? HALF AN HOUR. MUST HAVE HAPPENED AFTER YOU LEFT. WELL, THAT'S THE END OF HIM AS A POSSIBLE GOLD MINE. NOW WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT YOU. ME? YEAH. WHY PICK ON ME? I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO A LOT OF RICH PEOPLE. DON'T KID ME, CHARLES. YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW WAS MacFAY'S PARTNER BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN MY FOOT SLIPPED. IF MY FATHER-IN-LAW HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, I'LL GIVE YOU A CHECK RIGHT NOW. BUT I WANT PROOF. THERE'S ALWAYS THE CATCH IN IT. PROOF! LOOK, NOBODY BUT ME WAS PUTTING ANYTHING ON PAPER IN THOSE DAYS, CHARLES. THAT'S WHY NOBODY BUT ME WENT OVER. KNEW YOU WERE GONNA BE TOUGH TO DEAL WITH, AND I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY THAT I'VE EVER DREAMED ABOUT YOU... OR ABOUT YOUR WIFE... OR ABOUT YOUR...BABY... YET. Church: STOP IT, DUM-DUM! STOP IT! TSK TSK. MEN ARE SUCH ROWDIES. THAT'S TO REMIND YOU NOT TO DREAM ABOUT MY FAMILY. CALL A CAB. WE'LL CATCH THE 9:00 TRAIN. STILL HEADED FOR CUBA? STILL CUBA. BUT I'LL BE BACK. I THINK AS TIME GOES ON YOU'LL SEE YOUR WAY CLEAR TO DOING BUSINESS WITH ME. YOU MEAN CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU. COME ALONG, ASTA. HE DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY ANYMORE. [RUFF RUFF] THANKS FOR NOT SHOOTING ME. OH, THAT WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE THINGS WORSE. [CHUCKLES] [TELEPHONE RINGS] THERE YOU ARE, 3 FOR NEW YORK. NOW, WHAT WILL YOU HAVE? YES, JUST THIS MINUTE. WANT ME TO STOP THEM? NO, NO, THAT'S FINE, THANKS. THEY'VE LEFT. Lois: THANK HEAVEN. Freddie: THAT'S MORE LIKE IT. Colonel: I KNEW YOU'D SCARE HIM OFF. I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURE IT'S OVER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MY GUESS IS THAT WHATEVER HE MEANT TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE HE STILL MEANS TO DO. IF I WERE YOU, COLONEL, I'D MOVE TO NEW YORK. I'M GOING TO STAY RIGHT HERE. ALL RIGHT. REMEMBER, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU STAY HERE YOU'RE...VERY APT TO STAY HERE. NONSENSE. AS LONG AS HE KNEW YOU WERE HERE, HE LIT OUT. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT HIS TALK WITH ME DIDN'T SOUND LIKE IT. HE WANTS TO INCLUDE NORA AND ME IN THIS SHAKEDOWN ON THE GROUNDS THAT HER FATHER WAS YOUR PARTNER. WAS HE IN ON THIS MESS? BECAUSE IF HE WAS, I WANT TO SETTLE WITH CHURCH. SURE, SURE--GIVE HIM ANYTHING HE WANTS. A FEW THOUSAND HERE, A FEW THOUSAND THERE, WHAT'S IT MATTER? IT ALL GROWS ON TREES. THAT ISN'T ANSWERING MY QUESTION. RUN ALONG. ALL OF YOU. RUN ALONG. Dudley: GOOD NIGHT, SIR. Lois: GOOD NIGHT, FATHER. YOU KNOW MY FATHER WASN'T IN THIS IF THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG. MY FATHER WAS JUST AS HONEST AS YOURS. SOMEDAY YOU'LL FIND WHAT A HOT RECOMMENDATION THAT IS. [DOOR CLOSES] YOU KNEW NORA'S FATHER, CHARLES. DO YOU THINK HE WAS A CROOK? NO. DO YOU THINK I'M A CROOK? NO... WELL, FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT, CAN YOU PRETEND YOU THINK I AM? I CAN DO THAT, ALL RIGHT. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT. NOW, NORA'S FATHER KNEW MORE ABOUT LUMBER AND MINES THAN ANY MAN IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW THE FIRST WORD ABOUT FINANCE-- I DID. SO IF I'M A CROOK, AND NORA'S FATHER'S AN HONEST MAN, WHY SHOULD I GIVE HIM A SHARE OF ANY CROOKED DEAL I PUT OVER? I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF IT, BUT I KNOW YOU'VE SAID SOMETHING NICE. THANK YOU. COME ON, YOU BIG FLATFOOT. GOOD NIGHT, COLONEL. GOOD-NIGHT. AND DON'T LET ME HEAR ANY MORE ABOUT PAYING CHURCH. I'VE SLAVED FOR THAT MONEY OF YOURS, AND I FEEL ABOUT IT JUST AS IF IT WERE MY OWN. HIS OWN. YOU'RE SUSPICIOUS OF EVERYTHING. WELL, I'D HATE TO WAKE UP SOME MORNING AND FIND THE FORTUNE I MARRIED YOU FOR WAS GONE. STOP TALKING THAT WAY. OF COURSE, I CAN ALWAYS EARN A GOOD LIVING AS A DETECTIVE. BUT WHAT WORRIES ME IS, WHAT ARE YOU AND NICKIE GOING TO LIVE ON? YOU NEEDN'T WAIT UP ANY LONGER, DOROTHY. THANK YOU, MADAM. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, SIR. YOU KNOW, SHE WOULDN'T BE A BAD LOOKER IF SHE TOOK HER SPECS OFF. I'LL SPEAK TO HER. OH, DON'T GET HER HOPES UP. NICKIE IN THERE? NO, I'M KEEPING HIM IN HERE TONIGHT. IN HERE? YES, I WANTED TO BE SURE HE WAS SAFE. WHERE IS HE? IN THE BUREAU DRAWER. THE-- IN THE BUREAU? HA HA. WELL, THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH. HE LOVES IT. HE WENT RIGHT TO SLEEP. I HOPE IT DOESN'T GET TO BE A HABIT. IT WOULD BE A LITTLE INCONVENIENT WHEN HE GROWS UP. HEY...YOU DIDN'T PUT MY THINGS UNDERNEATH THERE? NO, THEY'RE IN THAT CHEST. OH. I MAY BE A LITTLE PREJUDICED, BUT I THINK HE'S ALL RIGHT. ASTA...JUST A MINUTE. THERE YOU ARE. MY, IT'S STUFFY IN HERE. OPEN THE WINDOWS, DUM-DUM. WHAT TIME IS IT? 5 MINUTES TO 11:00. YOU'VE GOT TO GO RIGHT AWAY AGAIN, DON'T YOU? WE GOT A FEW MINUTES. I HATE THESE SCHEMES WHERE ALL THE PIECES HAVE TO FIT TOGETHER. TOO MANY THINGS CAN GO WRONG. WE CAN'T MISS. WELL, I WISH YOU'D DREAM UP SOME WAY TO GET THAT NICK CHARLES OUT OF THERE. I DON'T TRUST HIM. HE LOOKS LIKE A GUY WITH INSOMNIA TO ME. I DON'T LIKE HIM AROUND, BUT I DON'T SEE HOW HE CAN GUM OUR GAME. IT WAS AIRTIGHT WITHOUT HIM, IT'LL BE AIRTIGHT WITH HIM. DON'T LET THIS GOOG BOTHER YOU. PLENTY OF WINNERS HAVE HAD 'EM. [DOORBELL BUZZING] HELLO, SMITTY. BUSY? WHY, UH, NO. NO, NEVER TOO BUSY TO SEE A FRIEND. COME ON IN. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? NOTHING MUCH. HELLO, CHURCH. HI, DIAMOND BACK. COME ON IN, COME ON. I ONLY GOT A MINUTE. A GUY CAME IN FROM UP THE RIVER THIS MORNING... WITH A LINE ON YOUR HUSBAND. OH? WHAT IS IT? WHAT DID TIP SAY? UH, DO YOU MIND? NO. [DOOR CLOSES] WELL, WHAT'S TIP UP TO NOW? STILL KICKING ABOUT WANTING A LARGER CELL? HE'S BEEN THINKING AGAIN. HE JUST SENT DOWN A LOT OF ORDERS, FOR MATERIAL AND STUFF WITH THE WARDEN'S NAME FORGED ON THEM. LET'S SEE. HE WANTS YOU TO MAKE A DEAL WITH SOMEONE WHO CAN PASS HIMSELF OFF AS THE WARDEN'S GO-BETWEEN... COLLECT THE RAKE-OFF. NOTHING CAN STOP THAT BOY. HE'S A SMART LITTLE GUY. TOO SMART. 7 YEARS I BEEN MARRIED TO HIM, AND HE'S SO SLICK HE HASN'T BEEN OUT OF THE CAN LONG ENOUGH TO FINISH OUR HONEYMOON. DON'T SEEM TO BE BREAKING YOUR HEART. YOU, UH...YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THIS GUY CHURCH, DON'T YOU? DON'T START THAT AGAIN. HE'S JUST A FRIEND, LIKE I TOLD YOU. AND A GUY CAN GET TO BE TOO GOOD A FRIEND. LIKE I TOLD YOU. WHEN'S HE GOING TO CUBA? HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WAS GOING? I GET AROUND. HE'S GOING TOMORROW. GOOD. HOPE NOTHING HAPPENS TO UPSET HIS PLANS. BE SEEING YOU. SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO SKIN A KNUCKLE ON THAT FOUR-EYED GENT. YOU BETTER CATCH HIM WITHOUT THE CHEATERS ON. HE'S PLENTY GOOD, AS LONG AS HE CAN SEE. [CLOCK CHIMING] 11:00. TIME TO GO. ADIOS. GOOD LUCK. [DOOR CLOSES] WISH ME LUCK. SAY, I THOUGHT THIS WAS STRICTLY BUSINESS. YOU KNOW, I COULD GO FOR YOU. DON'T GIVE ME THAT. I'VE BEEN FOOLED TOO MANY TIMES. YOU LOVE ME, DON'T YOU? WHAT IF I DO? I'M ONLY IN THIS FOR THE COIN. WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF COIN FROM NOW ON, BABY. "WE"? YOU AND ME. WHAT DO YOU SAY? WANT TO PLAY FOR KEEPS? OK. NOW, MAYBE I OUGHT TO KNOW A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE INS AND OUTS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WHAT'S THE MATTER? LOSING CONFIDENCE IN ME SINCE I STOPPED THAT PUNCH? NO. I HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH SENSE. TIME FOR YOU TO MAKE THAT TELEPHONE CALL. BYE, HONEY. I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED FOR YOU. [DOOR CLOSES] HELLO? THIS IS MRS. H. CALVERTON SMITH. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO-- [MORE SLOWLY] I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK... [BABY FUSSING] [GIGGLES] OH. YOU WANT TO PLAY. ALL RIGHT... IF YOU'LL PROMISE TO GO BACK TO SLEEP. HMM? YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH HIM? OH, NO. HE'S ASLEEP. ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN PLAY WITH HIM, BUT PROMISE NOT TO WAKE HIM. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT WON'T COME OFF. PULL IT--YOU'LL SEE. WORK HARD, HONEY. MAYBE YOU CAN GET IT OUT. HUH? IT'S ALL RIGHT, DARLING. IT'S JUST THE BABY. OH...HE'S GETTING SO BIG. MMM? WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS WHO'S GOING TO TELL HIM. HMM? TELL HIM WHAT? ABOUT LIFE. HUH? LIFE. WHOSE LIFE? NOW, NICKY, THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. IF HE WERE A GIRL, THAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. THEN I'D DO IT. MMM. BUT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT BOYS THAN I DO. MMM. SO YOU OUGHT TO TELL HIM. HMM. ALL RIGHT. WHERE IS HE? OH, NOT NOW. I MEAN WHEN HE'S ABOUT 14. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] HERE. YOU HOLD HIM. MMM. [CHUCKLES] OH, HOW NICE.

OH, I DON'T WANT TO DISTURB YOU. NONSENSE, WE'RE DYING FOR COMPANY. NICK JUST HAS TO PUT ON HIS ROBE. YES, DEAR. OH, PLEASE DON'T. I MUSTN'T STAY. YOU'LL WANT TO GO TO SLEEP. WELL, SOME OF US DO, AND SOME OF US DON'T. OH, ISN'T HE LOVELY? IN ALL THE EXCITEMENT, I HADN'T EVEN SEEN HIM. HE'S A DARLING. WE SORT OF LIKE HIM. WE MIGHT AS WELL. WE'RE STUCK WITH HIM. HELLO, SWEETHEART. ISN'T IT KIND OF LATE FOR YOU TO BE UP? HE'S STILL RUNNING ON CALIFORNIA TIME. [SARCASTIC CHUCKLE] COME ON, GIVE ME A SMILE. COME ON-- [GUNSHOT] Nora: THAT SOUNDED LIKE A SHOT. Lois: THAT WAS A SHOT! Nick: JUST A MINUTE. PLEASE HURRY! PLEASE HURRY-- FATHER! SEE IF HE'S ALL RIGHT! WAIT HERE WITH NORA. THAT'S A MEAN WAY TO DIE. KNOW ANY GOOD WAYS? I'D BETTER TELL LOIS. I HEARD THE NOISE. MacFAY'S BEEN MURDERED. WELL, WE ALL HAVE TO GO SOMEDAY. SHALL I CALL THE SHERIFF? YES. [SIRENS] [TALKING AND ACTION NOT AUDIBLE] [SIRENS] Man: CALLING ALL CARS, ATTENTION ALL CARS-- WANTED FOR MURDER, PHIL CHURCH. AGE--37; HEIGHT--5 FEET, 11 INCHES; WEIGHT--185 POUNDS; EYES--BROWN; HAIR--DARK, GRAY AT THE TEMPLE. LAST SEEN WEARING A LIGHT GRAY SUIT... PHOTOGRAPH EVERY INCH OF THAT SILL. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, DOC?

CHECKS. THAT OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH TO GO ON. I'LL GO INTO THINGS MORE THOROUGHLY TOMORROW. THANKS, DOC. MR. CHARLES SAYS THAT CUBAN THREW A BIG KNIFE AT HIM. THAT MIGHT BE THE SAME KNIFE. IT WOULD HAVE THE MARKS OF HIS DOG'S TEETH ON THE HANDLE. GET SOME OF THE BOYS BUSY IN THE BUSHES TO LOOK FOR IT. YES, SIR. COME ON, JIM. HE MUST HAVE GONE OUT THE FRONT DOOR. HE? WHO? CHURCH. OR THE CUBAN. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW. I JUST SEEN THE FRONT DOOR OPEN WHEN I WENT DOWN CELLAR. WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THE CELLAR? I WENT DOWN TO FIX THE FUSE. WHAT FUSE? THE FUSE. IT WAS BLOWED OUT. HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS BLOWED OUT? I DON'T KNOW NOTHING. I WAS JUST DOING WHAT MRS. BELLAM TOLD ME. AND YOU WERE HERE EATING, HUH? YES. AIN'T THAT KIND OF LATE FOR A LADY YOUR AGE TO BE UP? I DON'T THINK SO. GOT THINGS ON YOUR MIND THAT WORRY YOU, KEEP YOU AWAKE? NO. I JUST DON'T SLEEP MUCH. YOU BEEN WORKING FOR HIM A LONG TIME, HAVEN'T YOU? 16 YEARS. AND YOU KNEW THIS PHIL CHURCH WHEN HE WORKED FOR THE OLD MAN? YES, INDEED, I KNEW HIM. NOW YOU JUST SIT RIGHT DOWN HERE AND MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A NICE LONG TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU KNEW ABOUT HIM. YOU WEREN'T IN BED, AND YOU WERE ALL DRESSED. WHERE WERE YOU? I WAS SITTING HERE, WRITING. WRITING WHAT? A PLAY. OH, GO ON. WHAT KIND OF A PLAY? A MYSTERY PLAY. SO YOU WRITE ABOUT MURDERS, EH? YOU EVER THINK MUCH ABOUT MURDERS? NO. AND YOU SAY MISS MacFAY AND MRS. CHARLES WERE THE ONLY ONES IN YOUR ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED-- IS THAT RIGHT? NO. THEN THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE. YES. WHO? THE BABY. OH, YES. THE BABY. BUT NOT THE NURSE? NO, NO. THE NURSE WAS IN HER OWN ROOM. ASLEEP, I IMAGINE. YOU'D BETTER ASK HER. HER ROOM IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM OURS. SHE AIN'T IN THERE. SHE AIN'T ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE. SHE'S GONE. PERSONALLY, I THINK SHE'S VERY WISE. OH, IS THAT SO? THIS IS A MURDER WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAR UP, LAD, SO LET'S DON'T HANG UP ON WHO TELLS WHAT. NOW, WHO GETS THE MONEY? ACCORDING TO HIS LAST WILL, MISS MacFAY WAS TO GET EVERYTHING BUT $100,000. THAT WENT TO MRS. BELLAM. WELL, NOW, WHAT DO YOU FIGURE ALL BUT $100,000 WOULD AMOUNT TO? CERTAINLY SEVERAL MILLIONS. [WHISTLES] AND YOU SAY YOU'D BEEN ASLEEP ABOUT AN HOUR WHEN YOU HEARD THE SHOT. I SAID HALF AN HOUR. IF YOU'D STOP WASTING TIME HERE AND START LOOKING FOR CHURCH-- I GOT A LOT OF TIME TO WASTE. NOW, THIS CHURCH-- YOU SAY YOU WORKED TOGETHER. ARE YOU AND HE STILL PRETTY CLOSE? NEVER PRETTY CLOSE. YOU DIDN'T LIKE EACH OTHER MUCH, EH? THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, ARE YOU UNFRIENDS ENOUGH THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE HIM GO BACK TO JAIL, OR MAYBE THE CHAIR? ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I'D FRAME HIM? DON'T GET SORE OVER A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT. WAIT TILL YOU HEAR WHAT I'M REALLY GOING TO SUGGEST. IT SEEMS TO ME, MRS. CHARLES, THAT EVERY TIME YOUR HUSBAND GETS IN WITH A GIRL, THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TAKE AN AWFUL BEATING. NOW, IT'S NICE, VERY NICE, FOR A WIFE TO TRUST HER HUSBAND... BUT GET THIS-- THERE'S THAT WYNER GIRL HE KNEW BEFORE HE WAS MARRIED. HE COMES HERE TO NEW YORK, AND BING! THERE'S A MURDER. HE GOES BACK TO THE WEST COAST, THERE'S A GOOD-LOOKING GIRL THERE, AND BING! THERE'S ANOTHER MURDER. HE COMES BACK HERE, MEETS THIS LOIS MacFAY, AND-- AND BING! [CAN'T SNAP] BING! [SNAPS] BING! THERE'S ANOTHER MURDER. LISTEN...WE'RE NOT DISHING THE DIRT ON YOUR HUSBAND FOR THE FUN OF IT. WE'RE TRYING TO SHOW YOU WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST. IT AIN'T IN THE BOOKS THAT A MAN THAT'S HAD THAT MANY NUMBERS COULD SETTLE DOWN TO ONE. WAS HE REALLY LIKE THAT? WAS HE? OOH, BABY! I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS BRAGGING. DID HE EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE COAL MAN'S WIDOW IN CLEVELAND THAT WANTED TO SET HIM UP IN THE AGENCY FOR HIMSELF? WAS THAT JEANETTE? NO. HER NAME WAS BELLA SPRUCE. BELLA SPRUCE? AND THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER'S DAUGHTER IN-- THE WHAT? THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER'S DAUGHTER. WHAT WAS HER NAME? WHAT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO IS THIS, LOIS. YOU'RE WRONG TO THINK THERE COULDN'T BE ANYTHING BETWEEN THEM. THEY'RE JUST MAKING A MONKEY OUT OF YOU. COVERING UP FOR THEM. I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT WHAT WAS THE LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER'S DAUGHTER'S NAME? LETTIE FINHADDEN. LETTIE FINHADDEN. HE WASN'T IN THE ROOM WITH YOU WHEN IT HAPPENED, WAS HE? HMM? I SAY, HE MADE YOU GIVE HIM THAT ALIBI, DIDN'T HE? OH, NO. OH, MR. CHARLES. I'M VAN SLACK, THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY. OH, YES. I THOUGHT PERHAPS... OF COURSE, EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR REPUTATION, BUT, UH... IF YOU DON'T MIND... OH, NOT AT ALL. WELL, I'M, UH, A LITTLE CONFUSED. THE LAMP TORN AWAY, GLASS OF WATER KNOCKED OVER... SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN QUITE A STRUGGLE, BUT NOBODY HEARD ANYTHING. FUNNY YOU DIDN'T, MR. CHARLES. THE WAY I FIGURE IT, MacFAY WAS LYING HERE READING THE PAPER. HE PUTS IT DOWN, HE TURNS OFF THE LAMP. THE MURDERER COMES IN THROUGH THE DOOR... OR THE WINDOW. MacFAY HEARS HIM. HE GRABS FOR HIS GUN-- IT WAS HIS GUN, WASN'T IT? OH, YES, YES. HE KEPT IT ON THE TABLE. HMM... FROM THE LOOKS OF THIS HOLE, LES, WHERE WOULD YOU SAY THE BULLET WAS FIRED FROM? WELL, I FIGURED IT COME FROM... ABOUT HERE. HMM. THEN THE MURDERER WAS ALREADY BEARING DOWN ON HIS ARM WHEN MacFAY GOT THE SHOT AWAY. OR IT COULD HAVE GONE OFF WHEN IT HIT THE FLOOR AFTER THE ARM WAS BROKEN. A PARAFFIN TEST WILL SHOW YOU WHETHER MacFAY PULLED THE TRIGGER. YES, YES... THEN THE MURDERER KNOCKED HIM BACK ON THE PILLOW WITH A BLUNT INSTRUMENT THEN WENT AFTER HIM WITH A KNIFE. ANYTHING TO SHOW THAT HE CAME IN THROUGH THE WINDOW? NO, NOT YET. ONE OF THE SERVANTS SAID THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPEN. YES... IF YOU AND THE 2 OTHER GENTLEMEN CAME, AS YOU SAID, WHEN THE SHOT WAS FIRED, WOULDN'T YOU HAVE SEEN OR HEARD, OR...HMM? I DIDN'T GET HERE THAT QUICKLY. THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. OH... AN ELECTRICIAN CAN TELL YOU IF IT HAPPENED WHEN THE WIRES WERE CUT FROM THAT LAMP. ELECTRICIAN, YES... DID YOU PEOPLE HAVE A MAN WATCHING CHURCH? WELL, NOT EXACTLY. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE, BUT, UH... WELL, THE COLONEL WAS ALWAYS YELLING ABOUT SOMETHING, IMAGINING THINGS, WHICH YOU KNOW YOURSELF IS ALL PRETTY RIDICULOUS. COULD HAVE BEEN TURNED INTO A PRACTICAL JOKE, COULDN'T IT? THEN... YOU DIDN'T HAVE A-- YOU DIDN'T HAVE A HEAVYSET MAN WITH THICK GLASSES WATCHING CHURCH. NO. NO, I THOUGHT NOT. I'D NEVER SEEN A COUNTRY COP WITH A $6,000 COUPE BEFORE, SO I TOOK DOWN HIS NUMBER. I'LL GET IT. YOU GET ANYTHING OUT OF MRS. CHARLES? NO. SHE'S BATS. I WISH MY OLD LADY WAS BATS THAT WAY. HERE, DARLING, PLEASE DRINK THIS. NO ONE WILL TELL ME ANYTHING. I'D FEEL BETTER IF I KNEW WHETHER FATHER... DID HE DIE WITHOUT... THERE WAS NO PAIN. HE DIED INSTANTLY. WHERE WAS HE SHOT? HE WASN'T SHOT. IT WAS A KNIFE. A KNIFE? DON'T TALK ABOUT IT NOW, DEAR. LET'S ALL GET OUT OF HERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. SHE CAN'T STAY HERE. THAT SUITS ME. JUST AS SOON AS WE FINISH WITH THE POLICE. DID YOU HAVE YOUR SESSION WITH THEM? OH, YES. YES... IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. Lois: DO YOU THINK THE POLICE ARE GOING TO BE ENOUGH, OR-- I SHOULD SAY THEY WERE MORE THAN ENOUGH. SON, YOU'D BETTER TAKE A BROMIDE. YOU'RE SHAKING LIKE A LEAF. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T TOLD US? YES, WHAT IS IT, HORN? IT'S NO WONDER I'M JITTERY. THERE'S SOMEONE OUT TO GET LOIS. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I HAD A WARNING OVER THE PHONE, JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO--A MAN'S VOICE. HE SAID, "CALL EVERYBODY OFF, OR LOIS MacFAY WILL GET WHAT HER OLD MAN GOT." OH, NO! WE'VE GOT TO CALL EVERYONE OFF-- WE'VE GOT TO! YOU CAN'T CALL THE POLICE OFF ONCE THEY'RE IN. THE WARNING SAID CALL OFF EVERYBODY. IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF CHURCH'S GANG. SURE. YOU THINK CHURCH MURDERED THE COLONEL, DON'T YOU? DON'T YOU? OF COURSE. YOUR DOG IS OUTSIDE, RUNNING AROUND WITH A KNIFE IN ITS MOUTH. ASTA. QUICK, NICKY. THAT WILL BE ASTA. [MEN WHISTLING] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOOT THAT MUTT. WE'LL NEVER FIND HIM LIKE THIS. WAIT A MINUTE. HE'S NOT GOING TO COME RUNNING UP TO A LOT OF STRANGE MEN WITH LIGHTS. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE IS, A MOTH? CALL YOU MEN OFF, WILL YOU? LET ME HAVE A FLASHLIGHT. GIVE ME THAT. HEY BOYS, LAY OFF. GIVE MR. CHARLES A CHANCE. NOW, UH... WHERE DID THE DOG FIND THE KNIFE? WE DON'T KNOW. HE CAME AROUND THATAWAY. WHERE IS HE NOW? HE WENT THATAWAY. I'LL GO THISAWAY. ASTA! [WHISTLES] ASTA, COME HERE. GIVE IT TO ME. Lois: MR. CHARLES! WHAT? MR. CHARLES! MR. CHARLES! YES? YES, DEAR? WELL, WHAT IS IT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S THE MATTER? IT'S-- HE HAS A GUN! HE HAS WHAT? LOOK OUT! [GUNSHOT] Man: WHY, IT'S HORN! Second man: WELL, CAN YOU BEAT THAT? WHAT WERE YOU SHOOTING AT HIM FOR? I WASN'T SHOOTING AT HIM, HE WAS SHOOTING AT ME. WHY WERE YOU SHOOTING AT HIM? WELL, EVERYBODY ELSE WAS. [RUFF RUFF] SHE'S ALL RIGHT. SHE'S ALIVE. IT'S JUST HER ARM. CARRY HER INTO THE HOUSE. WHAT WAS SHE DOING HERE? SHE CAME OUT TO TELL ME THAT SOMEONE WAS AFTER ME. AND SHE YELLED AND PUSHED ME OUT OF THE WAY JUST AS HE STARTED SHOOTING. YOU DON'T THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO...MMM? YOU KNOW. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, PUT ME ON THE SPOT? OH, NO. IF SHE HADN'T PUSHED ME OUT OF THE WAY, HIS FIRST BULLET WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ME. I ALMOST HEARD IT GO PAST. IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT. WELL, HERE'S THE KNIFE. THAT'S THE ONE THAT WAS USED, ALL RIGHT. COULD BE THE ONE THAT WAS TOSSED AT ME. NOT MUCH CHANCE OF FINGERPRINTS AFTER THE DOG HAS BEEN PLAYING WITH IT FOR NOBODY KNOWS HOW LONG. I'M APOLOGIZING. TAKE IT IN, TELL THEM TO CHECK IT ANYWAY. FUNNY THAT THE DOG SHOULD HAVE GOT HOLD OF IT THE SECOND TIME. YES, YES, YES, YOU MAY BE RIGHT. MISS MacFAY...WHEN DID YOU FIRST SUSPECT HORN OF KILLING YOUR FATHER? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I DIDN'T SAY HE KILLED FATHER. YOUR FATHER OBJECTED TO HORN AS YOUR SUITOR, DIDN'T HE? YES. AND IF YOU HAD MARRIED HORN, HE'D HAVE CUT YOU OFF WITHOUT A DIME. I SUPPOSE HE WOULD HAVE. AS SOON AS YOUR FATHER WAS DEAD, YOU BECAME EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE FINANCIALLY. OH, DON'T, PLEASE, DON'T! PLEASE, MR. VAN SLACK. SHE'S BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH ALREADY. SORRY, SON. WHAT WAS THE FIRST REACTION YOU SAW ON HORN AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE MURDER? WHY, NOTHING. HE... HE JUST CAME TO TELL ME THAT... FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED. YES, YES, THEN WHAT? AND THEN HE SAID TO SAY THAT WE WERE TOGETHER WHEN IT HAPPENED-- SO THE POLICE WOULDN'T BOTHER ME. HE SAID THAT? YES. HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT ME. HA! HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HIMSELF, CHILD! NO. NO, HE COULDN'T HAVE! FREDDIE! TAKE IT EASY, LOIS. MAYBE FATHER WAS RIGHT ABOUT DUDLEY. I WOULDN'T LISTEN TO HIM. OH, POOR FATHER. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT... WELL, I GUESS THAT DOES IT. DOES WHAT? DON'T YOU GET IT? NO. WE KNOW THAT HORN AND CHURCH ARE ENEMIES. WHEN CHURCH STARTS TO THREATEN MacFAY, HORN SEES A CHANCE TO FRAME HIM. HE KILLS MacFAY USING THE CUBAN'S KNIFE TO DO IT. IF HE WANTED TO FRAME CHURCH WITH A KNIFE, WHY SHOULD HE TRY TO KILL ME WHEN I FIND IT? LOOKS TO ME AS IF YOU'VE GOT 2 MYSTERIES ON YOUR HANDS INSTEAD OF 1. NOW YOU KNOW WHY I RETIRED. GOOD LUCK. YOU'RE NOT WALKING OUT ON ME, ARE YOU? I'M NOT WALKING OUT, I'M RUNNING OUT. MIND YOU, IF THERE WERE ANY REASONABLE CHANCE FOR ME TO HELP YOU, IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. BUT DURING THIS QUIET LITTLE WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY, MY FAMILY'S BEEN THREATENED, I'VE HAD A KNIFE THROWN AT ME, I'VE BEEN SHOT AT, AND I'VE BEEN SUSPECTED OF MURDER. FROM NOW ON, THIS IS YOUR CASE. YOU HANDLE IT. I'M GOING BACK TO NEW YORK AND FORGET IT. COME ON, MOM. COME ON, LOIS. COME ON, MRS. BELLAM. Nora: COME ON, FREDDIE. MAYBE I'M WRONG. COME ON, ASTA. [RUFF RUFF] Newsy: EXTRY! [YELLING HEADLINES] GET THE LATEST PAPER! EXTRY! EXTRY! [CONTINUES CALLING] Paperboy: EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT! DREAM BUTCHER HUNTED! EXTRA! EXTRA! DREAM BUTCHER HUNTED! READ ALL ABOUT IT! Paperboy outside: EXTRA! EXTRA! DREAM BUTCHER HUNTED! READ ALL ABOUT IT! WHAT IS IT? WHAT ARE THEY CALLING? NOTHING, NOTHING. HAVE THEY FOUND HIM? NOT YET. HOW DO YOU FEEL? SORT OF FUNNY. THE DOCTOR GAVE YOU SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU SLEEP. 6:00? HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL THAT TIME? I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE ALONE WHEN YOU WOKE UP. YOU'RE SO GOOD TO ME. WHY SHOULDN'T I BE GOOD TO MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD? OH...FORGIVE ME. I DIDN'T MEAN EVER TO TELL YOU. IT--IT JUST SLIPPED OUT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DON'T HATE ME. OH, PLEASE, DON'T HATE ME. I COULDN'T BEAR IT IF YOU DID. I AM YOUR MOTHER. BUT I DON'T ASK ANYTHING-- ONLY TO BE ALLOWED TO STAY NEAR YOU. WE HEARD YOU TALKING, SO WE KNEW YOU WERE AWAKE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, LOIS? WHY, YES, YES. WHAT'S THE MATTER, LOIS? YOU LOOK UPSET. IT'S NOTHING. IT'S JUST THAT I'M SO ALL AT SEA WITH FATHER AND DUDLEY GONE. TO HAVE TO GO ON DECIDING THINGS ALL ALONE-- Nick: YOU WON'T BE ALONE LONG. WAIT TILL THE NEWS OF YOUR 5 MILLIONS HITS THE FRONT PAGES. YOU'LL FIND YOU'VE GOT RELATIVES ALL OVER THE WORLD. LOOK, LOIS, I HAVEN'T MUCH TO OFFER YOU. I DON'T ASK ANYTHING IN RETURN. BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS, OR WHEREVER YOU ARE, YOU CAN ALWAYS KNOW I'M STANDING BY. Lois: OH, FREDDIE, DEAR, YOU'RE SO SWEET. [KNOCKING] OH, MR. CHARLES, MR. VAN SLACK'S IN YOUR ROOM WAITING FOR YOU. OH, THANK YOU. MOMMY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN LATER? I GOT RID OF ALL THOSE REPORTERS. WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM? I TOLD THEM WE WERE OUT OF SCOTCH. WHAT A GRUESOME THOUGHT. [SHIVERS] HELLO. HI, CHARLES. I DON'T LIKE TO DISTURB YOU, BUT FACT IS, WE SEEM TO WORK QUITE WELL TOGETHER, AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT RECONSIDER AND COME BACK ON THE CASE. COME BACK ON THE CASE? I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF IT. WHAT'S UP? WELL, THE NEW YORK POLICE FOUND THE WOMAN WHO WAS WITH CHURCH. I'M ON MY WAY UP THERE NOW. YOU CARE TO COME ALONG? SURE. I'LL GET MY HAT. I, UH, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TRACE THAT NURSE, DOROTHY WATERS. WE HAVE SOME FINGERPRINTS FROM THE REFERENCES SHE GAVE TO MRS. CHARLES, AND THEY'RE CHECKING THEM NOW. HOW ABOUT THAT LICENSE NUMBER? OH, THAT CAR BELONGS TO A MAN BY THE NAME OF VOGEL. GAMBLER, RACKETEER. I'LL SEE HIM LATER. [TELEPHONE RINGING] THAT'S FOR YOU. [RING] HELLO? SPEAKING. WHO IS IT? NEVER MIND NAMES. JUST A FRIEND OF YOURS TELLING YOU THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU TO LAY OFF THAT MacFAY CASE. YOU UNDERSTAND? LET IT ALONE. IF YOU DON'T, WE'LL SHIP THAT BODY OF YOURS BACK IN A BOX. UH, THANK YOU, BUT WE HAVE AN ENCYCLOPEDIA. SHH. ISN'T THAT NICKIE CRYING? OHH. THAT WASN'T THE BABY. HE'S SOUND ASLEEP. [TELEPHONE RINGS] NICKY! NICKY! OH, GO ON AND RING. [RING] HELLO? I'VE GOT TO RUSH. WILL YOU CALL BACK LATER? HMM? WHAT? OH, MR. CHARLES IS NOT HERE. THIS IS MRS. CHARLES SPEAKING. MR. CHARLES AND I ALWAYS WORK TOGETHER. I HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION. YOU COME WHERE I TELL YOU, BUT UNDERSTAND, I AM NOT A STOOL PIGEON, SO DO NOT BRING ANY POLICE. I SEE. WHAT'S THE ADDRESS? I'LL BE THERE. MORNING, GUILD. WELL, HOW ARE YOU, MR. CHARLES? THINGS SURE POP WHEN YOU'RE IN TOWN, DON'T THEY? CERTAINLY DO. HELLO, MR. VAN SLACK. HIYA, GUILD. IS THIS THE SMITH WOMAN'S APARTMENT? YEAH, BUT IF YOUR KILLING WAS AT 1:00 LAST NIGHT, THEN SHE'S IN THE CLEAR. WE HAD A PLANT HERE FROM BEFORE MIDNIGHT TILL AFTER 3:00, AND SHE WAS IN HERE ALL THE TIME. ARE YOU SURE? POSITIVE. I WAS HERE MYSELF. HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO BE WATCHING HER PLACE? WELL, IT TURNED OUT TO BE A FALSE ALARM, BUT SHE CALLED ME UP ON THE TELEPHONE LAST NIGHT, AND SAID THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE HANGING AROUND-- SAY, COULD SHE HAVE BEEN USING ME AS AN ALIBI? WHY, SHE CAN'T DO THAT TO ME! [BANGING ON DOOR] HELLO, NICK. NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, LIEUTENANT. PLEASED TO MEET YOU. COME ON IN, SIT DOWN. I'LL GO GET YOU A CUP OF COFFEE. NEVER MIND. SO YOU PICKED ON ME TO GIVE YOU AN ALIBI, HUH? I GOT TO LOSE A NIGHT'S SLEEP SO YOU CAN DUCK A MURDER RAP. SO HELP ME, I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE MURDER. WHAT DID YOU THINK THEN? WELL, I KNEW PHIL CHURCH WAS TRYING TO GET DOUGH OUT OF MacFAY, BUT I NEVER KNEW HE MEANT TO MURDER HIM. YOU KNOW IT NOW, DON'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING THAT'S GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH MURDERS. MURDERS? HOW MANY OTHER MURDERS WERE PLANNED BESIDES MacFAY'S? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYBODY'S MURDERS BEING PLANNED. YOU'RE PSYCHIC, EH? YOU GOT ALIBIS FOR MURDERS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. I'M NEVER GOING TO NEED AN ALIBI FOR MURDER 'CAUSE I'M NEVER GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MURDER. WHERE'S CHURCH? I DON'T KNOW. HE AND DUM-DUM LEFT HERE ABOUT 11:00 LAST NIGHT. I AIN'T SEEN OR HEARD OF THEM SINCE. WHERE WERE THEY GOING? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN ARE THEY COMING BACK? THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK. THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO CUBA. WHOSE COAT IS THIS? PHIL'S. PHIL CHURCH'S. WHAT'S IT DOING HERE IF HE'S NOT COMING BACK? THAT'S BEEN HERE 2 OR 3 WEEKS. HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN CHURCH? JUST SINCE THEY SPRUNG HIM. DIDN'T TAKE YOU LONG TO TIE UP WITH HIM, DID IT? WE WEREN'T PLAYING FOR KEEPS. I WAS ONLY STOOGING FOR HIM. STOOGING? THERE ARE A LOT OF RACKETS WHERE IT'S HANDY TO HAVE A GIRL AROUND. BLACKMAIL RACKETS? I MEAN A LOT OF RACKETS EXCEPT MURDER. [DOORBELL BUZZES] THERE'S MY BELL. SIT DOWN. I'LL GET IT. WELL, HELLO, DIAMOND BACK. COME ON IN. HA HA. JOIN THE PARTY. WE'RE JUST ASKING SMITTY A FEW QUESTIONS. ABOUT CHURCH? I ALWAYS FIGURED HE WAS A WRONG GUY. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? ME? NOTHING, EXCEPT THAT HE'S BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME HANGING AROUND SMITTY. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN UNLOADING TO THESE PEOPLE YET, HAVE YOU? ONLY FROM HERE UP. DID YOU EVER HEAR ABOUT TALKING THROUGH A LAWYER? WE'VE GOT ENOUGH ON HER ALREADY TO HOLD HER AS A MATERIAL WITNESS. IS THIS THE MAN YOU SAW WATCHING CHURCH'S HOUSE? YEAH. WHY, YOU BIG APE! WHAT'S THE ANSWER? HER HUSBAND'S A PAL OF MINE. HE'S BEEN HANGING ON THE WALL UPSTATE. YOU KNOW HOW THOSE GUYS GET TO WORRYING? WELL, I'VE BEEN SORT OF KEEPING AN EYE ON HER FOR HIM. SO THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S BEEN GOING ON? YOU DON'T THINK I BEEN HANGING AROUND BECAUSE I WAS NUTS ABOUT YOU, DO YOU? I HEAR CHURCH IS GOING AWAY. FOR ALL I KNOW, THIS CLUCK MIGHT THINK SHE'S GOING WITH HIM. SUPPOSE SHE HAD GONE? THAT'S SUPPOSING TOO MUCH. THERE GOES DUM-DUM. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO PHIL CHURCH? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? I, UH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. DON'T ACT LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YOU FOUND OUT WE WERE GOING AWAY TOGETHER, AND YOU KNOCKED HIM OFF. YOU--YOU BIG LUG! [ARGUING] GET OFF OF ME! WHEN I FIND THOSE GLASSES, I'LL KILL YOU! YOU DIRTY RAT! YOU'D BEAT YOUR OWN MOTHER! I'LL BEAT THE HIDE OFF YOU WHEN I FIND THOSE GLASSES! LET ME GO! LAY OFF ME! I HAVEN'T HURT CHURCH! YOU GOT MY WORD FOR IT! YOU'D LIE ABOUT THE WEATHER, YOU DOUBLE-CROSSING, 4-EYED SNAKE! GET ME MY GLASSES! WHAT FOR? WANT TO PLAY POLICEMAN? WHERE ARE MY GLASSES? I ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS PLENTY OF COPPER IN YOU, YOU BIG FLAT-FOOTED STOOL PIGEON! GET ME MY GLASSES, AND I'LL GET OUT OF HERE! I'LL SET PHIL CHURCH TO DREAMING ABOUT YOU. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO! HE'LL DREAM YOU RIGHT INTO THE HUDSON RIVER WHERE YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING WORSE THAN POISON THE FISH. LET GO! LET GO OF ME! COME ON! COME ON! GET IN THERE, YOU. ALL RIGHT, HARRY. HEADQUARTERS, 32nd STREET. [WHISTLES] WEST INDIES CLUB. YES, SIR. FOLLOW THAT CAB. ¿COMO ESTAS? MUY BIEN, GRACIAS. ¿COMO ESTA NEGOCIO? BIEN, GRACIAS. MR. NICK CHARLES, IS IT NOT? IT IS.

HE'S SOMEWHERE RIGHT IN THIS ROOM. HE SAID HE HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING FOR DUM-DUM. NOW DUM-DUM OWES HIM $14.75 AND WON'T PAY HIM. HE SAID THAT IF I GAVE HIM THE $14.75, HE'D TELL ME WHERE DUM-DUM WAS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CONTACT THIS MYSTERIOUS INFORMER? I TOLD HIM I'D BE HOLDING THE MONEY IN A HANDKERCHIEF LIKE THIS. OHH. BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY UNTIL I SHOWED UP. I WAS DOING ALL RIGHT. I'D HAVE GOTTEN IT. MADAME, AT LAST! HELLO. I KNEW YOU WOULD COME TO ME. I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU ALL EVENING WITH THAT THOUGHT IN MY HEART... AND IN MY EYES. SHALL WE, UH, DANCE? YES. I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER. WHERE IS DUM-DUM? DUM-DUM? YES, I THINK I'D LIKE TO FIND HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HIM? NO. THEN WHY SHOULD HE SPOIL THE BEAUTY OF THIS MOMENT? WELL, REALLY. I HAVE A HUSBAND, YOU KNOW. HA! A STUPID AMERICAN ICEBERG, HUH? NO. HE'S TRAVELED ABROAD. AH, DOES HE EVER SPEAK TO YOU IN BURNING WORDS THAT MAKE YOU GO HALF-MAD WITH JOY AND YEARNING?

THINK HE KILLED MacFAY? DOES A MAN SAY HE THINK HIS FRIEND KILL? OHH! SAY, LISTEN, I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW WHO KILLED MOST OF THE GUYS THAT GET THEMSELVES KILLED IN THIS TOWN. WHO ARE YOU LOOKING AT NOW? IS THAT LITTLE SWINE DUM-DUM? WHY, UH... WAIT! IF YOU ARE NOT IN LOVE WITH HIM, WHY DO YOU LEAVE ME? LOOK, HERE'S YOUR MONEY. LET ME GO. MONEY? BETWEEN YOU AND ME?

THAT'S WHAT I TELL SOME OF THE OTHERS WHEN THEY KICK ABOUT HER THROWING NOISY PARTIES AND HAVING FIGHTS IN HER FLAT. SHE HAVE NOISY PARTIES? YOU KNOW HOW GIRLS ARE. NO, HOW ARE THEY? OH, GO ON.

YOU'RE COMING TO THE STATION WITH US, AIN'T YOU, MR. CHARLES? OH, NO, I CAN'T. I HAVE A LADY WAITING. A LADY? NO FOOLING. SURPRISED?

WELL, I AIN'T SEEN HER IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUT I DON'T MAKE NO POINT OF SEEING MY PEOPLE, UNLESS THEY'RE BEHIND ON THEIR RENT. MMM. WHAT'S SHE LOOK LIKE? THE WAY SHE SLAPS THAT MAKE-UP ON, YOU'D THINK SHE WAS AN OLD-TIMER. BUT SHE DON'T NEED TO. SHE'S REAL PRETTY. YOUNG? YES, BUT DON'T FEAR. SHE KNOWS ALL THE ANSWERS. WISHED I KNEW AS MUCH WHEN I WAS HER AGE. HA HA HA. AHEM. UH... HOPE I HAVEN'T KEPT YOU FROM RENTING A ROOM. WHO, HER? YEAH. OH, I DON'T THINK SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS. OH, TOO BAD. HA HA.

Mrs. Dolley: OH, COME IN! COME IN! WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU. OH, YES? THIS GENTLEMAN HERE WAS JUST SAYING THAT YOU'RE THE PRETTIEST GIRL HE'D EVER SEEN. AND TAKE IT FROM ME, HE OUGHT TO KNOW. OH, EXCUSE ME. THIS IS MR. CHARLES. MISS--I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME. FINHADDEN. LETTIE FINHADDEN. WELL, THAT'S THE FASTEST PIECE OF WORK I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE. Guild: MR. NICK CHARLES, PLEASE. GOOD MORNING, MR. CHARLES. THIS IS GUILD. WELL, WE'VE GOT SOMETHING ON THAT NURSE. WE JUST FOUND THAT HER FINGERPRINTS MATCH UP WITH AN AGNES BORUP. I KNOW AGNES WELL, AND FROM THAT LANDLADY'S DESCRIPTION OF LINDA MILLS, IT JUST ABOUT FITS HER. MY GUESS IS, IF WE GET HER, WE GET CHURCH. UH-HUH. OH, YES, YEAH. NO, I--I DON'T THINK SO. WELL, FOR ONE THING, A NEW LOVE HAS COME INTO CHURCH'S LIFE. SMITTY MAY HAVE BEEN STOOGING FOR HIM AT FIRST, BUT IT'S THE REAL THING NOW. THEY'RE PLANNING ON GOING AWAY TOGETHER. COME ON UP HERE. I MAY HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. YEAH. WHAT? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? TELL US! DID YOU FIND OUT SOMETHING? WELL... AREN'T YOU INTERESTED, MRS. BELLAM? OH, YES, YES. OH.

HE WANTS TO SEE YOU. I PUT HIM IN THE STUDY. OH... I THOUGHT MRS. BELLAM MIGHT BE HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS. CAN I DO SOMETHING? I JUST WANT SOMEONE TO KEEP AN EYE ON NICKIE. WELL, LET ME. OH, THAT'S VERY NICE, BUT I-- WELL, LOIS SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP, ANYWAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEND IT RIGHT UP. WHO IS THIS MAN? I DON'T KNOW. A BIG MAN WITH HEAVY GLASSES. AH, VOGEL. VOGEL? WHO'S VOGEL? HE'S ONE OF THE MISSING PIECES. Man: GET YOUR HANDS UP. BOTH OF YOU. Nick: THIS IS MR. CHURCH, DARLING-- SKIP IT. GOT NO TIME TO WASTE. TOLD YOU I'D BE SEEING YOU, CHARLES, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT'D BE THIS SOON. I BEEN DREAMING AGAIN, CHARLES. ONLY THIS TIME, IT'S ABOUT YOU. YOU OUGHT TO BE PSYCHOANALYZED. TWICE I'VE SEEN YOU DEAD IN MY DREAMS. BOTH TIMES YOU'RE ALL BATTERED UP, JUST LIKE MacFAY WAS. SO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A WIDOW, MRS. CHARLES, GET HIM ON A TRAIN TONIGHT. I'M FEELING I'M GOING TO HAVE THAT THIRD DREAM. I'M PACKING RIGHT NOW. OK. NOW, IF YOU'RE SMART, YOU'LL WAIT 5 MINUTES BEFORE YOU BLOW ANY WHISTLES. [SIGHS] GET HIM! WHAT? DON'T MIND ME. GO ON, GET HIM! WELL, WHY? NEVER SAW A MAN TRYING SO HARD TO GET CAUGHT. NOW LOOK AT THE CLOWN, CLIMBING ACROSS THAT LEDGE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. WELL, WHY DOES HE WANT TO GET CAUGHT? JUST PART OF HIS PLAN. [GUNSHOT] WHERE IS HE? WHAT HAPPENED, NICK? WHO DO YOU WANT BLASTED? MAN'S JUST BEEN KILLED. I THINK YOU BOYS BETTER GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE THE POLICE ARRIVE. GRAB YOUR KIDS-- HOLY SMOKE! WHAT HAPPENED?! Man: HEY, GET OUT OF THE WAY, WILL YOU? [BABIES CRYING, MEN SHOUTING] FREDDIE, WILL YOU GET NICKIE? OH, OF COURSE I WILL. DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO NOTIFY THE POLICE OF THAT? THEY'LL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. WHERE'S NICKIE? WHERE'S NICKIE? Man: MUST BE IN THE PEN! Lois: THERE HE IS! Man: WE'D BETTER GET OUT OF HERE! [NICKIE CRYING] YES...WELL... YOU, UH... YOU WANT TO SEE ME? WASN'T IMPORTANT. JUST DROPPED IN TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING NEW. I'LL WAIT TILL YOU'RE FREE. I'M FREE NOW. TOMORROW WILL DO. TOMORROW YOU MAY NOT BE FREE. YOU BETTER WAIT. [ALL TALKING AT ONCE] Guild: STAND ASIDE. STAND ASIDE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, CASEY? PHIL CHURCH WAS SHOT. HE FELL IN THE ALLEY. WE ARRESTED THIS MAN AND WOMAN. THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES AROUND WHEN IT HAPPENED. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, LIEUTENANT. FOUND THIS IN THE TRASH CAN, ONE SHELL EMPTY. IT WASN'T MINE, LIEUTENANT. I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY REASON TO KILL PHIL. BRING THEM ALONG UPSTAIRS, BOYS. HEAR FROM THE DOCTOR? DOCTOR SAYS HE WAS SHOT WITH A .38. JUDGING FROM THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE BULLET ENTERED THE BODY, IT COULD HAVE COME FROM MOST ANYWHERE. THEY'RE WORKING ON THE GUN NOW TO SEE IF IT'S THE ONE. Nick: HMM. WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THE STREET DOWN BELOW? MR. CHURCH TOLD ME HE WAS COMING HERE. I TELL HER. THEN I'M AFRAID SHE COME OVER AND BUTT IN, MAYBE, SO I COME MAYBE TO STOP HER. STOP HER? FROM WHAT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE MAY DO. SHE GET EXCITED ON THE PHONE. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? FRAME ME? LOOK, I KNOW THAT PHIL CHURCH IS TRYING TO PULL A TRICK THAT'S TOO SLICK FOR HIS OWN GOOD, SO I COME OVER HERE TO HEAD HIM OFF. WELL, YOU CERTAINLY PICKED A GOOD WAY TO DO IT. LOOK, I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANY MURDERS, AND I'M NEVER GOING TO BE-- NOW, DON'T GIVE ME THAT STUFF AGAIN! WELL, WHAT ABOUT IT? DID YOU SEE HER DO IT? I JUST SEEN HER. I WAS CROSSING STREET TO HER. TRUCK GOT IN MY WAY. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO KILLED PHIL CHURCH, ASK HIM. Smitty: YOU HEARD HIM LAST NIGHT THREATEN WHAT HE'D DO IF ME AND PHIL RAN OFF TOGETHER. ASK HIM! YOU KILL MY MR. CHURCH? ASK HIM WHERE'S HIS GUN. I'VE GOT MY GUN RIGHT HERE. DON'T TRY TO HANG THIS ON ME. YOU KILL MY MR. CHURCH?! SURE HE DID. HE KILLED PHIL. HEY, COME ON! [ALL SHOUTING AT ONCE] Guild: HEY, BREAK IT UP! BREAK IT UP, WILL YOU?! Man: COME ON! LET ME-- NICKY, NICKY! DO SOMETHING! HMM? OH, YES. OF COURSE. Man: LET HIM ALONE! LET HIM ALONE! Guild: HERE, NOW, YOU-- NOW, YOU STOP. SPITFIRE! UGH! SIT DOWN, THERE. YOU ASKED FOR IT. UH...DID SOMEBODY DROP THIS CHIP? WHY, YES. IT'S MINE. OH. GOOD. NOW, ONE MORE SESSION LIKE THAT, AND I'LL CALL UP THE WAGON AND DRAG YOU ALL DOWNTOWN. MAY I...SAY SOMETHING? GO AHEAD. UH...WELL, I HAVE A HUNCH IF WE FIND OUT WHO MURDERED MacFAY, WE'LL FIND OUT WHO MURDERED CHURCH. MAYBE IT'LL CLEAR THINGS UP IF WE START FROM THE BEGINNING. TELL ME THIS FIRST: IF...IF YOU WERE TRYING A MAN FOR MURDER AND HE SUDDENLY PRODUCED AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? HE'D GO FREE. SUPPOSE AFTER YOU FREED HIM, YOU FOUND THAT HE WAS GUILTY, THAT HE'D PLANNED THE WHOLE THING-- WHAT COULD YOU DO? NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL. I SEE. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU MEAN, YOU'D LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT? WELL, WE'D HAVE TO. CAN'T TRY A MAN FOR THE SAME CRIME TWICE. IF HE'S ACQUITTED, HE COULD EVEN BOAST ABOUT IT, AND WE COULDN'T TOUCH HIM. UH, THAT WAS CHURCH'S PLAN. WHAT WAS? HIS IDEA WAS TO ADVERTISE HIMSELF AS THE MURDERER WHILE HIS ACCOMPLICE DID THE DIRTY WORK. HE TAKES A HOUSE ON LONG ISLAND. HE THREATENS MacFAY, TERRORIZES THE HOUSEHOLD. AFTER THE MURDER, HE DISAPPEARS, STILL CALLING ATTENTION TO HIMSELF AS THE KILLER. THEN, WHEN THINGS LOOK BLACKEST FOR HIM, HE WALKS IN HERE, INVITING ME TO TAKE HIM. HIS PLAN WAS TO GET TRIED FOR THAT MURDER, SPRING A LAST-MINUTE ALIBI, AND WALK OUT OF THAT COURT SCOT-FREE. YOU MEAN THAT HE HAD THIS ALIBI ALL THE TIME? YES, BUT HE DIDN'T WANT US TO KNOW IT. THAT'S WHY DUM-DUM BEAT UP A DRUNK LAST NIGHT WHEN THE DRUNK TRIED TO TELL ME. YOU DID? WAS THAT IT? WAS THAT WHY YOU HIT HIM? I HIT HIM BECAUSE HE START A FIGHT. MAYBE VOGEL WILL TELL US. HE DIDN'T WANT IT KNOWN EITHER. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL? YOUR MEN JUMPED HIM, TOO. Guild: WERE YOU IN ON THIS? YOU THINK I'D BE IN ON ANYTHING WITH THAT RAT? LOOKS BAD FOR YOU, VOGEL. YOU WERE DOWN ON THE ISLAND. YOU KNEW THE SETUP. YOU TRIED TO KEEP SMITTY FROM TALKING. YOUR MEN THREATENED ME ON THE PHONE, TOLD ME IF I DIDN'T LAY OFF-- MY MEN? WHAT MEN? THE ONES WHO DROPPED THAT CHIP AT THE WEST INDIES CLUB LAST NIGHT. OH. COME ON, DIAMOND BACK, SPILL IT. OK, OK. I... I RUN A PLACE UPTOWN. IT'S...WELL, IT'S A PLACE. GET WHAT I MEAN, OR SHOULD I WAIT FOR MY LAWYER? WE GET IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO ADMIT YOU RUN A GAMBLING JOINT. GO ON! THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST, CHURCH COMES IN AND SITS IN THE GAME FOR 2 1/2 HOURS, INCLUDING THE TIME MacFAY WAS KILLED OUT ON THE ISLAND. THEN YOU-- YOU HELPED HIM GET HIS ALIBI. I TELL YOU, I WASN'T IN THIS WITH HIM. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN WHY DID YOU KEEP IT QUIET? WELL, THAT NIGHT A BUNCH OF MY BEST CUSTOMERS WERE THERE... A BANK PRESIDENT, BIG GUYS LIKE THAT... BIG AND RESPECTABLE. THEY HAVE TO GET UP IN COURT AND ADMIT THEY WERE PLAYING IN MY PLACE, THEY MIGHT AS WELL CUT THEIR THROATS. SO, I'M OUT TO GET THE GUYS WHO CAN SPILL IT. AND YOUR MEN WERE OUT TO GET ME. THANK YOU. HMM... I KNEW CHURCH'S PLAN WAS GOOD, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THAT GOOD. OH, HE WAS A GENIUS. Nick: LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING ELSE HE PLANNED. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT CHURCH. HE'S DEAD. IT'S THE KILLER WE'RE AFTER. YES, I'M COMING TO THAT. YOU MEAN, YOU KNOW WHO HE IS? Nick: I HAVE A PRETTY FAIR IDEA. AND IF THIS TRICK TURNS OUT RIGHT, I'LL BE SURE. LET'S SAY THIS IS MacFAY'S ROOM AND THAT THIS IS HIS BED. WE'LL FIX THINGS JUST AS WE FOUND THEM THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. LET ME SEE...THERE WAS A NEWSPAPER ON THE FLOOR-- STOP ME IF I'M WRONG. Guild: HERE'S A PAPER. NOW, LET ME SEE... THERE WERE SOME BOOKS. I'LL GET THOSE, NICKY. THANK YOU, MOMMY. A GLASS OF WATER? I'LL GET IT. Nick: NO, NO, MRS. BELLAM. YOU STAY HERE. ONE OF THE BOYS WILL GET IT. FREDDIE, WOULD YOU MIND STANDING OVER THERE? SURELY. AND WATCH EVERYTHING VERY CAREFULLY. A LAMP? Van Slack: I'LL GET THAT. Nick: IF I REMEMBER, THE CORD WAS PULLED FROM THE LAMP. LET'S SEE... FORGOT THE GUN. YES, I HAVE MY OWN RIGHT HERE. [GUN HAMMER COCKS] THERE WE ARE. NOW MAY I HAVE THE BOOKS, MOMMY? YOU KNOW, THIS TRICK SHOULD WORK. CHURCH PLANNED IT, AND CHURCH WAS AN ENGINEER. THERE WE ARE. IF YOU'D JUST LET ME HAVE THE PAPER... Guild: THE PAPER. THANK YOU. JUST ONE SHEET WILL DO. IT WAS JUST ONE SHEET THAT WAS WET, WASN'T IT? WHY...YES. OK. PAPER SERVES AS A NONCONDUCTOR. PLACE A SMALL PIECE BETWEEN THE EXPOSED WIRE AND A METALLIC PART OF THE GUN. NOW THE WATER, PLEASE. YOU WATCHING THIS CAREFULLY, FREDDIE? OH, YES, YES. IT MIGHT BE YOUR FINISH. JUST DROP THE WATER IN THIS INDENTATION. THERE YOU ARE. MIND PLUGGING THAT IN? THANK YOU. 12 MINUTES PAST. NOW, WOULD YOU ALL MIND STEPPING DOWN TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM? BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. GIVE IT TIME. RUN, MOMMY, FAST. ANYONE WANT A DRINK? BUT REALLY, MR. CHARLES, WHERE DOES ALL THIS GET US? WELL, YOU REMEMBER YOU SAID IT WAS FUNNY THAT I DIDN'T HEAR ANY SOUNDS OF A STRUGGLE IN MacFAY'S ROOM? WELL, I DID THINK THAT-- WELL, I DIDN'T HEAR ANY SOUND OF A STRUGGLE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO STRUGGLE. OH, BUT ALL THIS-- HIS BROKEN WRIST, THE SHOT HE FIRED. MacFAY DIDN'T FIRE THAT SHOT. WHAT? HE WAS DEAD WHEN IT WENT OFF. THE MURDERER STAGED THIS WHOLE THING, JUST AS I HAVE, TO MAKE IT LOOK AS IF THERE'D BEEN A ROW. THIS LITTLE TRICK GAVE HIM...OR HER A CHANCE TO GET AWAY AND GET AN ALIBI. WELL, THAT BROKEN WRIST, IT SORT OF ELIMINATES A WOMAN, DOESN'T IT? IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO BREAK A DEAD MAN'S WRIST. EVEN A WOMAN COULD DO THAT. OH...MRS. BELLAM? YES? YOU WERE THE LAST ONE TO SEE COLONEL MacFAY, WEREN'T YOU? YES. WHAT TIME WAS THAT? ABOUT MIDNIGHT. BUT YOU CAN'T SAY I DID IT! HE WASN'T KILLED UNTIL 1:00! YOU MEAN THE SHOT DIDN'T GO OFF UNTIL 1:00. WE DON'T KNOW YET WHEN HE WAS KILLED. Van Slack: YOU WERE AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MacFAY'S, WEREN'T YOU? WEREN'T YOU?! WELL, WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT? MAYBE WE BETTER HAVE EVERYBODY IN ON THIS. TRY THE SECOND DOOR DOWN ON THE LEFT. KEY'S IN THE LOCK. WHO IS IT? IF I KNOW MY PERFUMES, IT'S DOROTHY...OR AGNES OR WHATEVER HER NAME IS. Dorothy: I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING! YOU LET ME GO! I--I TOLD YOU, I HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS! THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I CAME TO SEE MR. CHARLES! WHEN I CAME TO WORK FOR YOU, MR. CHARLES, I'D JUST GOTTEN OUT OF PRISON. GOOD GRACIOUS! I WAS GOING STRAIGHT, BUT I KNEW THE POLICE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ME AFTER THAT KILLING, SO I LIT OUT! BUT I COULDN'T REST EASY. I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO MR. CHARLES! WELL, WHY SHOULD YOU, AN EX-CONVICT, SEEK EMPLOYMENT IN THE HOME OF A MAN KNOWN THE WORLD OVER AS A GREAT DETECTIVE? BECAUSE NICK CHARLES NEVER REFUSED A BREAK TO ANYBODY IN HIS LIFE! AND I MEANT TO PROVE TO HIM AND MRS. CHARLES THAT I COULD MAKE GOOD, AND THEN I WAS GOING TO TELL THEM! IT'S ALL RIGHT. I KNEW ABOUT YOU. WAIT A MOMENT! GUILD HERE SAYS THIS WOMAN WAS THE ONE AT THE CHESTERFEAR APARTMENTS. I'M AFRAID, FOR ONCE, THE LIEUTENANT IS WRONG. SHE WASN'T. LOOK, NICKY! IT'S SMOKING. [GUNSHOT] IT WORKED! Guild: HEY, GIVE ME THAT ROD! I KNEW IT WAS DUM-DUM ALL THE TIME. WAS IT HIM? NO. DUM-DUM WAS ONLY TRYING TO GET THE ACCOMPLICE WHO KILLED HIS MR. CHURCH. Van Slack: WELL, BUT WHO--WHO-- I'M AFRAID YOU PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION. THIS LITTLE TRICK I JUST SHOWED YOU GAVE THE MURDERER 5 MINUTES TO GET AWAY AND GET AN ALIBI. THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO USED THAT PARTICULAR ALIBI. CHURCH PLANNED THIS TRICK, AND... YOU CARRIED IT THROUGH. THAT'S WHY CHURCH HAD SMITTY TO STOOGE FOR HIM, SO THAT NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT THAT HE WAS MIXED UP WITH ANOTHER WOMAN. Nora: NICK! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WHY-- YOU WERE FRIENDS WITH CHURCH AND DUM-DUM. THAT'S WHY YOUR DOG WAS FRIENDS WITH THEM, LET THEM COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASED. THAT'S WHY YOUR DOG STOOD ON HIS HIND LEGS, AS THE PRINTS SHOWED, WITH HIS PAWS ON HIS KILLER'S SHOULDERS WHEN HE GOT HIS THROAT CUT. WELL, IF THEY WERE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS, WHY DID THEY HAVE TO KILL HIM? TO AVOID ANY SUSPICION THAT YOU AND CHURCH WERE WORKING TOGETHER. IT'S A LIE! I KILLED MacFAY. CAREFUL, FREDDIE. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HORN WHEN HE TRIED TO PROTECT HER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN THAT HORN MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE COMMITTED THE MURDER. HE WAS JITTERY THAT NIGHT, ALMOST OUT OF CONTROL. HE TOLD US HE'D HAD A THREAT AGAINST LOIS' LIFE. THAT WAS TO DIVERT SUSPICION FROM HER. HORN WANTED TO GET ME OFF THE CASE. WHEN I WENT OUT ON THE GROUNDS LOOKING FOR ASTA AND THAT KNIFE, HE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE FAIRLY SAFE TO TAKE A SHOT AT ME. IF HE WAS CAUGHT, HE COULD BLAME IT ON THE DARKNESS, SAY HE MISTOOK ME FOR CHURCH OR DUM-DUM. YOU WERE AFRAID OF HORN, AFRAID THAT HE MIGHT BREAK AND GIVE YOU AWAY. BESIDES, YOU WERE REALLY STUCK ON PHIL CHURCH. SO YOU LET HORN GO OUT TO GET ME, AND THEN YOU RAN ON AHEAD AND WARNED ME SO THAT I'D HAVE TIME TO DRAW A GUN ON HIM. THEN YOU PUSHED ME OUT OF THE WAY OF HIS BULLET, FIGURING THAT I'D SHOOT HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE, WHICH IS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE HAD TO DO, BUT THE POLICE STEPPED IN AND DID THE JOB FOR BOTH OF US. NICKY, YOU'RE JUST GUESSING. YOU'RE SAYING HORRIBLE THINGS! IT'S THE ONLY WAY IT MAKES SENSE. SENSE? WHAT SENSE COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE IN MY KILLING FATHER?! BECAUSE YOU WANTED HIS MONEY AND YOU WANTED IT NOW. BUT FATHER GAVE ME EVERYTHING I COULD POSSIBLY NEED. WHY, HE-- BUT THAT WASN'T YOUR KIND OF LIFE. YOUR KIND OF LIFE WAS THE LINDA MILLS LIFE THAT YOU'VE BEEN LEADING EVER SINCE YOU GOT NERVE ENOUGH TO SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE AFTER THE FOLKS WENT TO SLEEP. LINDA MILLS? YES, MY SWEET. "L.M.," FOR LINDA MILLS AND LOIS MacFAY. LINDA MILLS, WHO SLEEPS WITHOUT PILLOWS, JUST AS YOU DO. LINDA MILLS, IN WHOSE APARTMENT THERE'S A SCORCHED SPOT BESIDE THE BED AND A BULLET HOLE IN THE WALL WHERE THIS TRICK WAS REHEARSED. WHY, YOU CAN'T MEAN THESE THINGS. TELL HIM IT ISN'T TRUE! IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO PROVE. WE'LL JUST TAKE HER OVER TO SEE MRS. DOLLEY. OF COURSE, WHEN DUM-DUM COMES TO, HE CAN TELL US, BUT I WOULDN'T ADVISE YOU TO WAIT FOR THAT. DUM-DUM'S A LITTLE SORE AT YOU FOR KILLING HIS MR. CHURCH. MY KILLING CHURCH? OH, NOW, REALLY-- YOU FOUND OUT RIGHT AFTER THE MURDER THAT HE'D DITCHED YOU FOR SMITTY. AND YOU KNEW THAT HE HAD YOU IN A SPOT WHERE HE COULD BLACKMAIL YOU FOR LIFE. SO YOU SHOT HIM AS HE STOOD ON THAT LEDGE, AND THREW THE GUN OUT YOUR WINDOW. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT LINDA MILLS AND THE OTHER THINGS. I GOT SICK AND TIRED OF PLAYING LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD TO THAT OLD GUY, SO WHEN PHIL WAS FOOLING AROUND TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF HIM, I FOUND WE SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE. I'M NOT SORRY FOR IT. IT WAS A CHANCE, AND I TOOK IT. NOW, WHAT I'M GETTING AT'S THIS: I'LL MAKE A DEAL WITH YOU. WHAT WILL YOU OFFER US? THE MOON? YOU LIKE THAT BRAT OF YOURS, DON'T YOU? ALL RIGHT. YOU LET ME WALK OUT OF HERE, AND I'LL SEND IT BACK IN A HALF HOUR. FREDDIE! WHAT DID YOU DO WITH HIM? I PUT HIM IN LOIS' ROOM. GO LOOK. SHE CAN LOOK ALL SHE WANTS. SHE WON'T FIND HIM. IF ANYTHING'S HAPPENED TO THAT KID-- Nora: NICK! NICK! Nick: IS HE THERE? IT ISN'T NICKIE. NICKIE'S GONE. MAKE UP YOUR MIND. SEND ME TO THE CHAIR, OR GET YOUR KID BACK ALL IN ONE PIECE. [SHOUTING OUTSIDE DOOR] Woman: [ITALIAN ACCENT] LET ME IN! LET ME IN! Man: YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE! Woman: I WANT TO GO IN THERE! LET ME IN HERE! WHERE'S MY BABY? WHERE'S MY BABY? [BABY CRYING] WHERE'S MY RAPHAEL? HE'S IN HERE. HE'S RIGHT HERE. Wacky: I'LL GO WITH YOU. TRYING TO PULL A FAST ONE, EH? I SAW IT WASN'T THEIR KID, AND I TOOK A CHANCE. CAN'T BLAME ME FOR TRYING. COME ON. YOU UNGRATEFUL LITTLE FIEND! WHAT'S THE MATTER, MA? DON'T YOU CALL ME MA! HA! SO YOU ADMIT IT'S A GAG, HUH? WELL, BETTER LUCK ON YOUR NEXT RACKET. ALL RIGHT. GET GOING. Woman: [ITALIAN ACCENT] GIVE ME A GUN! GIVE ME A GUN! GIVE ME A GUN! WHAT, ANOTHER MURDER? THAT DOG! HE WON'T LET ME HAVE THE BABY! ASTA. [ARF ARF ARF] KEEP IT QUIET NOW, WILL YOU? Woman: WHERE'S MY RAPHAEL?! ASTA! WHERE'S MY BABY? OH, OH, MY RAPHAEL! MY BEAUTIFUL BABY! [RAPHAEL CRIES] OH, MY LOVELY LITTLE CHERUB. YOU SEE? YOU CAN'T BLAME ME FOR MAKING A MISTAKE. THEY BOTH LOOK ALIKE, DON'T THEY? WHY, YOU IMBECILLE! MY GOD! YOU'RE MY BEAUTIFUL RAPHAEL! YOU DON'T TELL ME-- [WOMAN'S SHOUTS RECEDE] MOMMY... LET'S SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN? WHAT FOR? JUST TO GET A LITTLE REST AFTER OUR QUIET WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY. OHH... CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY WARNER BROS.
