There is a painting by Paul Klee. It is called "Angelus Novus." It's an angel who seems about to move away from something he stares at. His eyes are wide, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how the angel of history must look. His face is turned to the past, where a chain of events appears. He sees a catastrophe, which keeps piling wreckage at his feet. The angel would like to stay and awaken the dead, but the storm is blowing from paradise which drives him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him, grows towards the sky. What we call progress is this storm. Walter Benjamin. My father was born in Vienna. His father was a German-speaking Jew, born in the Austria-Hungarian empire on what was then, the border with Poland. His mother was Hungarian. My mother was born in Germany, daughter of a German father from Alsace, which today lies in France, and a German mother from Pomerania, which now belongs to Poland. For so many years I've wanted to tell the story of my father and his father. How both of them were forced out of Europe for their Jewish origins, and ended up on the other side of the world. How they became migrants. As I retraced the journey of my father and his parents, I am humbled by what they had to go through just to stay alive. Just to keep going day after day. František Josef Factory Czech Republic I was born on the 5th of April 1930, in Pilsen, today in the Czech Republic, in a city known for its beer and its cola factory. At home, I spoke German. At school, I spoke Czech. My father is a child. Other children in the neighborhood throw stones at him and call him "Jew". In the face of stones, he walks to school. He studies. He grows. At the age of 20, to finance his studies, and to help my grandmother, Theresa, my father becomes private tutor to Victor, son of Jewish entrepreneur, Otto Petschek. At the Petschek family mansion, my father meets my mother, Charlotte, the governess of the children of another Jewish family, the Epsteins. The Petschek family own a bank in the center of Prague and the Johann David Starck chemical factory in the town of Kaznějov, near the border with Germany, where my father secures his first job. In Kaznějov, we speak German in our own circle and Czech, when dealing with merchants, public servants or workers. A relic of old class divisions in which the Germans regarded themselves as superior to the Czechs. My father is one of the inventors of the scientific formula for citric acid. A harmless additive used in the manufacture of drinks to create the scent and flavor of lemons, also the most efficient food preservative at the time. I remember the workshop with its lathes spinning countless machine parts, the thunder of electric motors as they drive leather transmission belts across a blackened ceiling. I remember, in all this activity, an oasis of tranquility, natural light, white walls, order. Back then, Czechoslovakia was this incredible flowering of modernity and optimism. Prague had a booming economy and vibrant cultural life. Concert halls were filled to capacity. This was a beautiful, young model of democracy for the whole of Europe, born out of the First World War and about to be strangled by the Second. Poldi Steel Factory Czech Republic I grew up in Brazil, in a military dictatorship. I guess when you grow up under a military regime, you learn early on in life to take a point of view. If you reject injustice, you must oppose the regime. And so, like so many others of my generation, I did that. And that sentiment stays with you for the rest of your life. Years later, I moved to study in London and I myself became a migrant. For my father's 75th birthday, me and my brother, Marcelo, brought him back to the little town of Kaznějov in Czech Republic. It was his first visit there for so many years. We wanted to understand where he had come from. Here is what was left over from the building where we used to live. This is the window of our kitchen which led to the back of a factory of glue made of bones. Over there was my room and after that, the dining room. Here was Opa's studio which was also the living room in this window here. It was the nicest place in the apartment. It had really nice furniture made of natural wood with a bookcase... It was a very pleasant place to be. This was the home where he once lived and the factory where his father worked. Everything still stood, but was barely operational. We were received by the factory's directors like royalty. The family of the inventor of the citric acid formula. Today, all of it is gone. We travel on to Pilsen and to Prague. Everywhere we go, my father tells us, "This person was taken to a concentration camp, this person was shot, this person was murdered, this one committed suicide." All of those, close friends. All this, my father witnessed while still a child. All of this, he never mentioned before. Suddenly it hits me, this is a side of my father I had never seen before. I always thought that my father was a bit disconnected from the brutalities of the world. Those who lived through the horror of The Second World War, those who survived have had to live with a great sadness. Perhaps the only way to do that, is to shut the sadness deep inside you. I learned from my dad and my mum the habit of making things, creating things. It comes from his way of seeing the world. Creativity is a way of living and looking at everything. He brought all those habits with him from his homeland in his suitcase. The knowledge of other cultures, other talents, other lands. My father likes to say that for him, work is not a job. Work and life are one. It's a joy. Pentagram Design When I was little, I used to ask my dad, "How ugly is this?" "How beautiful is that?" My dad instigated in us, a love for design, art, history, and almost an obsession with architecture. Drawing is an idiom we all share. My brother became an architect and I became a designer. I remember in Kaznějov, I gazed from my window on a view of wheat fields framed by a forest of pines. A fire blazes in the forest. Later, I draw the scene in colored pencil. I select the color red for my trees and reveal, for the first time, that I'm color-blind. I remember a street, lined with chestnut trees. In spring, the trees are heavy with beautiful flowers in the shape of candelabra. In the summer, we make ice cream with wild strawberries or raspberries picked from nearby woods. In autumn, the spiky fruit of the chestnut tree contains a shiny brown nut. In winter, we visit relatives in Berlin. At the zoo, I pose for a photograph with a lion cub. It scratches my knee and tears a hole in my sock. There are machines which, in exchange for a coin, will dispense candies or a chocolate bar. A Mr. Hitler is in power, but it's the vending machines I recall. Our family friends, the Bienenfelds, have a daughter my own age. Lisa is sweet and kind, and before long we are walking arm in arm. We don't hide this romance from our parents, who think it adorable. Annoyed at this reaction, Lisa and I, soon part. In the Early '40s, we moved from Kaznějov to Prague because my father lost his job in Kaznějov. We lived in an apartment with the Epstein family in the Vinohrady district. It's this yellow building on the corner. We lived on the first floor, facing the square. What happened to the Epsteins after that? The Epsteins lived there until '42 and then were deported to Auschwitz where they all died. September 1939, and Germany invades. My father is dismissed from the Starck factory and we're evicted from our company apartment. The new regime introduces a bilingual system of visual communication, first name German, second name Czech. Drivers must drive on the right, not the left. Jews may not drive at all, so we must sell our car. Belongings, including a treasured Leica camera, are placed in storage. We move to Prague, leaving behind my beautiful chrome scooter, a treasured gift from my uncle, Ricardo. Soon, my father will be required to wear the infamous yellow star. My father's expertise in citric acid is seen as useful to the economy. So, for now, he remains employed, despite being a Jew. This, and perhaps his marriage to a gentile woman of good breeding, is enough to protect him from Nazi race laws... for now. At this time, the industrial process for citric acid is a closely guarded secret, one that may prove my father's salvation. It may also cost him his life. "If the dismissal of Jewish scientists means the annihilation of contemporary German science, then we shall do without science for a few years." Adolf Hitler Mayrau Factory Cloakroom Czech Republic As I traveled through the Czech Republic, trying to understand my father and grandfather's life, I discovered this factory and its cloakroom. Everything has been left completely untouched for decades. Just like this. We're now under a puppet government run by a protector of the Reich. The tragic irony is that The Gestapo established their headquarters and torture chambers in a bank building formerly owned by my father's employers and close Jewish friends, the Petscheks. I remember the cruelty of Reich protector Reinhard Heydrich, the butcher of Prague. It's beyond imagining. Heydrich had designed a master plan for the extermination of all Jews in Europe. With the support of the British Secret Service, Heydrich is ambushed by the Czech resistance and fatally wounded. The Nazi's revenge is swift and savage. In a fury at the loss of his best man, Hitler orders all those who cannot prove their innocence, to be executed. In the weeks after Heydrich's death, some 13,000 people are rounded up. Just five days after the ambush, the Nazis descend on the village of Lidice, Journey through Licice's grounds assumed to have sheltered the resistance. The men are shot and woman and children dispatched to concentration camps. The village itself is razed to the ground. Hitler orders that salt should be thrown on the grounds so that nothing can grow there again. Everyone and everything, utterly destroyed. Village of Lidice Original site after destruction Today, we'll find towns named Lidice in Canada, in the United States and in South America in memory of this massacre. Children all over the world are named Lidice. All this brutality happens a few kilometers from my home. I am 12 years old. As a child, I would be witnessing several people dying in front of my eyes. My reaction was to look away because it was too shocking. Vovô, what's your favorite or strangest thing you've ever seen as color I think it was when I... saw from the window of my flat, of our flat, I saw a forest in flames. And so the trees were red because of the color of the flames, but at the same time they were green for other people, because there were still all the green leaves on them. So for you the trees were red and the fire was green instead of the fire being red... Yeah, you could say that. Yes. -Yes. I imagine that would be weird. If you had the camp fire then you'd see the fire... Sounds interesting. -And I was about your age when I saw that. Alfie and Dylan Alfred's grandchildren So what color would you see the grass? The grass I know is green. But I just happen to know about it, I don't see it green. So what color do you see it? For me, it... it is a light brown. Oh. If your eye color is different to someone else's, will you see the world differently? Do you think if everyone was color-blind, we would not judge people about their skin color? This book is about Czech history and it started being written in the 19th century about... I do feel very lucky to have such beautiful grandchildren, and especially the interest they have developed in laws of science, astronomy, life on earth and the universe, and things which always interested me and also interest them. If you got to see a black hole, would you be able to see the white hole? I am not sure about that, you know, yeah. Where are white holes? Also in the center of galaxies. Black hole is facing one side and the white hole is facing the other side, like a snout of a dog and the tail of the dog. Black hole and the white hole are like friends. Oh, yes, probably they are like... How's a white hole? -...relatives. Sputnik Prague The Epsteins rent an apartment in a middle-class neighborhood in Prague. Modest, compared to their mansion, but preserving a certain level of comfort and sophistication. Here, we are offered a home. In 1941, we're joined by my grandmother Theresa. The flat is small, but we're allowed a few pieces of furniture from storage. My parents' bedroom is a living room, office and library. I'm in the kitchen, where, along with sink, worktop, stove and dining table, I must fit my desk, my wardrobe and my bed. Essential items require a ration card, allotted according to ethnic group. First in line are Germans, then Czechs and, lastly, the Jews. Inspired by popular textbooks, I conduct my own chemical experiments, storing my ingredients on shelves above the kitchen counter. I learn to make soap and shaving cream, both of which are rationed. My first girlfriend, Lisa, is sent to England in one of the Kindertransporten. Years later, my own research of the Kindertransporten finds no reference to a Lisa Bienenfeld, and so she's lost to me... forever. 1942 and the deportation of the Jews. Despite all that has happened, despite the many signs that something like this might, in fact, happen, we are in shock. A year before, I'd attended a Jewish summer camp. Now, all the friends I made there have gone, sent to concentration camps. Never to return. I'm the only one left. After my friends, come members of my own family. My grandmother Theresa, a humble woman, is taken and transported to the concentration camp at Terezin. Here, she will die of typhoid. Terezin. A concentration camp with a difference. A model camp, used by the Nazis as propaganda, with theaters, schools, orchestras all used to fool the cameras and the world's press. No opera house in the world could ever have afforded the musical talent that was gathered there at the time. At the beginning of the war, there were around 350,000 Jews in Czechoslovakia. By the end, 20,000. Most of those who died, died in Terezin. It was not an ordinary concentration camp, but a stop on the way to Auschwitz and Birkenau. Inmates rarely went any further. It was rife with hunger and disease. The camp included hundreds of artists, musicians, scientists, teachers and writers. What would the world be like, if this had not happened, if all those people had not been murdered? All they could have created, invented, made, written, composed, loved. "I am a survivor of Terezin. Four of my friends survived. A world leading nuclear physicist, Prague's most respected neurologist, an extraordinary engineer and a very inspiring professor in Prague. And I became a biochemist 1.5 million children were murdered during the holocaust What could they have brought to the world?" Michaela Vidláková Between 1940 and 1943, my father was tolerated by the regime as technical consultant to two chemical factories in Prague. One for shoe polish, the other for paint. Each morning, he takes the tram to work, but is restricted to traveling in the last carriage. Jews are forbidden to sit, so even when surrounded by empty seats, he must stand. One of the measures of discrimination against the Jews established by Heydrich was that the Jews could only go by tram in certain places. And the Jews could only be in the back carriage and be on the middle platform. On the standing platform, they could not sit. If it was raining would they get wet? No, the deck was covered but they could not go to the sitting part. They had to stand in the middle. Urged on by the example of friends and relatives who have already emigrated, my father applies for a visa from the American consulate. Meanwhile, he requests permission from his former employers at Starck to consult for a rival manufacturer of citric acid. Suspecting an attempt at industrial espionage by this Jew, Starck informed The Gestapo. I remember our doorbell rings. Here, my father has recorded, in 3H pencil over several pages of microscopic handwriting, a secret that may cost us our lives. The process for the manufacture of citric acid. My father answers the doorbell and two gentlemen in leather jackets fill the doorway. He greets them politely. The leather jackets enter. The little one asks, "Herr Willer?" My father nods. He smiles. He ushers them towards the kitchen, but they turn instead to my father's study. The desk is piled high with books and papers, among them, open at a page of tiny handwriting, is my mother's recipe book. The small one drags a delicate finger along the spotless surface of a bureau as if to say, "Filthy, in here, wouldn't you say?" Helpfully, my father pulls open a drawer of assorted papers and empties them over my mother's recipe book burying, in the process, the incriminating recipe. The Gestapo flick through the pile, but they never find the book of secrets. Instead, they find our family's passports, which they confiscate. The leather jackets leave. With them, go our hopes of immigration. With each day that passes now, our chances of survival diminish. By the end of the war, we will be one of only 12 Jewish families remaining in Prague. Pinkas Synagogue Prague All these names, they are real people. They lived. My great grandmother's name is on the wall. Only now, when I see this in front of me, it becomes real. My grandfather told us, if the war had lasted another two weeks, they would have been next. He was so close. I live in Hackney, one of the most mixed areas of London. Alfie and Dylan go to the local school with children of so many origins, colors, faiths, religions, and many of them are refugees. I have come up with the theory of gravity. I think the inner core is gravity, because the inner core is a magnet, and we're the little things that connect to the magnet because we've got iron in our blood. And I think we can fly, because sometimes, if you get the back iron bit of the magnet, they connect, but if you get two magnets together you can't connect them, so I think that's why us humans can fly. There was one fellow... Pharaoh. Pharaoh... That actually believed in one God. The sun God, Ra. Yeah. I think it is the sun God, Ra. Yes. Do you remember the name of the Pharaoh? Tutankhamun, his father Ahkmenrah? Akhenaten. Then he married his sister. Why would you marry your sister? They worshiped-- That's dumb. All my life I've had a recurring dream. I dream of a beautiful, idyllic valley, a Shangri La. My country as it was, when I was a boy. It's a place I long to return to. In 1944, my father is summoned to a forced labor brigade building wooden sheds for factories displaced by Allied bombs. In July 1944, at the age of 14, in accordance with Nazi law my education ends and I must be put to work. Through an Austrian friend of my father, I find a position as an apprentice carpenter. In January 1945, swinging a hatchet, I cut my left forefinger. The wound is not serious, but becomes infected. Without antibiotics and with a diet low in vitamins, the wound takes longer to heal than the war does to end... And so I never return to work. Instead, with my hand in a sling, I explore medieval Prague. Prague, is the perfect city for a young dreamer with eyes wide open, drunk on architecture. In no other city could I find so many styles and periods side by side. The purity of the Romanesque, the stupendous austerity of the medieval, the ornate Gothic arches, The more than over-the-top Baroque, spitting decoration in all directions. And the, oh, so idiosyncratic cubist. And who would imagine that one day I would fall in love with modernist architecture and how function can orchestrate beauty? Why was I doing a sketch of this church? Because I was becoming interested in historical architecture. I had read about this church that was located in the suburbs out past an industrial area of Prague. So, I went on a Sunday because it was easier to arrive. When I came back from the village, the bombing started. I couldn't take the tram that would take me home It's a sunny day in early spring, 1945. I'm 15 years old. I'm in a village on the edge of the city, drawing a 12th century chapel. The streets are quiet and deserted. I fill my notebook with details and exterior views and turn for home. It's almost midday, near a hilltop above the factory district, when I hear the air-raid siren. I see a squadron of American flying fortresses high above the city. In strict formation, they move in my direction. They lay their bombs some 500 meters from where I stand. On impact, they suck the air from my lungs. I hug the earth. I race to join locals in an improvised shelter... and wait for hell to pass. Ten minutes later, the world is upside down. Factories, workshops, roads, roofs and chimneys are reduced to burning rubble. Dense smoke turns day to night. My enthusiasm for architecture makes me one of the few witnesses to the only large-scale air-attack on Prague during The Second World War. The one exception, a stray allied pilot who mistakes Prague for Dresden... Emmaus Monastery Prague ...and unloads his bombs on the medieval monastery of Emmaus. 1945. In addition to cameras and automobiles, Jews are forbidden radios, so I attempt to build one of my own. But it's no match for a secret shortwave radio receiver owned by a German friend of my father. The opening chords of Beethoven's fifth symphony announce news from the BBC and the defeats of the German armies. Not even a censored press can conceal the Allied advance. Following Hitler's death, the streets hum with rumors. A crowd has gathered in the street. I watch from a window as an SS officer draws his pistol to disperse the crowd. The SS man is alone and the crowd are many. They encircle the SS man. His target has engulfed him and now, with nowhere to aim his weapon, he is lost. He is shoved from behind and disappears from sight. I see people murdered in the street... on both sides. You learn not to look... but you never forget. When the war ended in '45, in the last few days, a popular revolt broke out against the Nazis and we spent the last five days hiding listening to the tanks passing over and from time to time, a cannon being shot. When it was all over, we went out to watch the parade of Russian troops and the German prisoners of war being taken to prison passed here on the street. Some prisoners were very tired and sick and passed out. One of them fell and passed out and was dragged to the doorway to rest. One of the members of the popular Czech army arrived and... ...and shot him on the spot. At the door of my house. Friends, teachers, friends of our teachers, the mothers and fathers of school friends, a friend who dared post a parcel of food to a relative in the camps and was arrested and murdered. Workmates, colleagues, factory workers, shopkeepers, neighbors... all gone. Dead. It was a great trauma. So great that after the war, most bilingual Czechs, could no longer bear to speak a word of the German language. Slowly, survivors of the concentration camps begin to return. PLATFORM EXIT Many survivors want to emigrate to Palestine or to the West. My uncle has insisted we join him in Brazil. My father agrees! And so it is decided, we will become Brazilians. However, to obtain passports to replace those taken from us by the Nazis we must first acquire Czechoslovak citizenship. Before the war we were Austrian, during the war we were German, now we must prove we are neither Nazis nor sympathizers. In January 1947, our documents are ready. We must travel light to reduce shipping costs. Still, we take a large part of my father's precious library, around 2,000 volumes. Boxes must be ticked. Bureaucrats must be appeased. Border guards must be greeted with smiles. Doubts and suspicions must be quashed. Holding our breath, we journey to Zurich, and from there to Marseilles. From here we embark for Brazil. Off the coast of Morocco, we encounter rough weather. Seasick, I'm confined to bed. The ship's ballroom is flooded and the piano is thrown into the sea, a wreck. Left behind is my chemistry lab. Also, a large china-headed doll with Victorian clothes, inherited by my mother from her mother and, too heavy to transport, a clay bust of a young Alfred Willer... A willow flute, chestnuts, ice cream, wild strawberries, our car, our Leica camera and my chrome scooter, wheat fields and pine forests, candies and chocolate bars, Prague and Kaznějov and Pilsen beer... The Johann David Starck factory... the thermoelectric power plant, ration cards and identity papers... homemade soap and shaving cream... The doorbell to our flat, leather jackets, a recipe book... and the desk piled high with papers. A hatchet, razor sharp. Secondhand books and postage stamps... American bombers... ruins and shortwave radios... a pistol... a tank... friends... teachers... a dead man hanging in a public square... and a little girl named Lisa. After 15 days at sea, one warm late afternoon, in January 1947, I stand on the deck of The Campana, beside my father. On the horizon, I can see a faint line of light. At 16, I came to live in Brazil. At 23, I acquired Brazilian nationality and married a Brazilian woman of German origin. With her I had two Brazilian children. At 50, I met my second wife who is English. Our son has dual nationality, Brazilian and English. My father cannot imagine what waits for him in Brazil. A nation of color where trees never lose their leaves and leaves are always green. The most racially mixed nation on earth. In the years after World War II, Brazil will embrace millions of survivors from every village, ghetto and bombed-out city in the old world. Jews, Czechs, Germans, Poles, Italians, Russians, Japanese, Hungarians, Austrians, and even Nazis. This is a land where native peoples, Portuguese settlers, and former African slaves co-exist. All survivors of epic journeys who have never forgotten how to smile. In the words of Jean Baudrillard, "If humanity ever runs out of hope, they should look to Brazil for inspiration." Marcelo Willer Alfred's son My father always says that every time he learns a new language he discovers a new side of his personality. Moving through cultures and countries has made him more complete. It is like he was also discovering himself. Daniel Willer Alfred's son I feel like it's difficult to watch my dad as he gets older, but then, at the same time, you see a lot of wisdom through age. I feel there's a very relaxed attitude to things which I think I've incorporated into my life. Clara Willer Alfred's granddaughter My grandfather taught me the habit of pressing flowers. It's a beautiful tradition he brought from his land. He sees the world in a different way. Sometimes it feels like he came from the moon. Both my father and my grandfather were part of that generation of engineers and architects of the 20th century who believed that science and art could dominate nature and build a better and fairer world. This utopia which was interrupted in Europe by the First and Second World Wars was still possible in the Brazil they found when they arrived in São Paulo. In Brazil, sensuality and beauty are not luxuries, but they are the fabric of life. Violence, pain, catastrophe, abundance, color and sound are all happening at once and at full volume. A country where the most advanced biotechnology is juxtaposed with the brutal reality of child-labor. Here, modernism is an explosion. Copan Building, São Paulo Oscar Niemeyer It abandons grids and lines and rules. Louveira Building, São Paulo Vilanova Artigas It embraces intuition. In Brazil, my father will become an architect. He will design our first home. Eiffel Building, São Paulo Oscar Niemeyer Here, our family will grow together and grow apart. Ibirapuera Park, São Paulo Oscar Niemeyer My father will follow his own journey towards a modernist Utopia. In Brazil, my father will learn a new word... One almost impossible to translate from Portuguese. That word is saudade. Saudade is a feeling of longing, of melancholy, of nostalgia. Alfred has always felt a deep saudade for the Europe of his youth, so brutally interrupted. As I get close to the end of this journey, I realize that for so long I hadn't fully known my father. This film has helped me understand him better. I also feel so much closer to all those who once were part of a distant history. Czechs, Jews, the Czech resistance, the people of Lidice, who all had their lives wrought by the Nazis. I feel a sense of solidarity with them. Vovô, are you a Jew? I am Jewish, I am Protestant, Catholic, Czech, German, Brazilian and English. I'm everything. What a salad! Vovô, what was the first thing you did when you got to Brazil? The first thing was to look for a banana. Why a banana? Well, because during the war it was impossible to find a banana, so it was seven years without eating a banana. Would you see that banana in yellow or do you see it in another color? I tend to see the difference between a green banana and a yellow banana. I have never understood an attachment to one nation, one culture, one origin. Our origins are many, our journeys utterly unpredictable. We are a mixture, and in this, there is beauty. To see Alfie and Dylan growing up, to see them with my father... what a gift. And the monkeys have gone for lunch. Yes, the monkeys in Rio stop for lunch.
