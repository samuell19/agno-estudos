DELIVER US FROM EVIL It begins way out here in the sticks where pewits draw patterns across the plain and the road only leads forwards or backwards. It's so peaceful out here. Not much ever happens. A snug haven for snug people, who, unlike others around the world, know the difference between right and wrong, good and bad. For here, the world is simple. And yet, we begin in the middle of a row between Frederik and Viola. What's going on in here? He pinched me and hit me! Pernille is a good mother. Aren't all mothers? Loving. Caring. We do not hit each other in this house! A teacher at the local school which serves most of the surrounding area. Follows her husband through thick and thin, and that says a great deal. For it was a long way from Oslo to B?kmarksbro. You must be nice to those smaller than you. one must be nice to everyone. But it's okay to hit evil people. There are no evil people, Viola. only people in need of love. Does that make them evil? It makes them sad. And then they often do bad things. But Osama bin laden is loved. I doubt that, Frederik. He's in need of love. But he's not sad. I rather think he is. Then why does he smile? He doesn't. Osama bin laden smiles a lot. Go brush your teeth. This is Anna, Pernille's colleague. Her purse is full of the new inserts she and Pernille are going to put in the school hymn books. They both teach Christianity. Anna is an angel. But her heart is too big. It's Saturday. Take a good look at her. It's your last chance, for Anna is going to die soon. This is Lars, a guy we all know. One of those who was last in line when the Lord handed out fates or who was there on the Lord's day off. Life just isn't fair, and Lars knows it all too well. Where are you? I'm sorry I pissed on you. It's all a load of crap. I always talk crap. I... This shit has got to end. When I come home, I'm going to do the right thing. Positive? What the hell do you mean? We're having a baby. That sure as shit doesn't sound positive to me! I'm really kinda fond of you, Scarlett. okay? So pick up the fucking phone and call me back! For fuck's sake! But at a pull-in between Hamburg and Krusaa, Lars sees the light. A sign, maybe. Lars knows something's got to give. Lars is tired of the loneliness in the truck. Hauling ass, year after year, from Rotterdam to Jutland. Tired of coming home to nothing but the Saturday bender. Tired of the Lord not giving a shit. Lars is going to take fate into his own hands. Get his girlfriend. Clean up his act. From today it will all be different. Today is the first day of a brand-new life. 12 bar. 12 times the atmospheric pressure. You can shoot a nail into a hardened oak board from six feet away with this. or from here to Esbjerg, as I always say. Do I still get the 10% discount? We'll work something out. Excuse me. Johannes. The second main character. Lars' brother, married to Pernille, Viola and Frederik's dad. Big-shot lawyer far removed from his brother's chaotic world. Returned to his hometown when he finally managed to persuade Pernille. For Johannes loves the high sky of West Jutland. And his childhood home was falling into decay. And, well, Lars didn't have the money. -Hi. -How's it going? It's coming together. Viola's okay? The penicillin cleared it right up. And the house? It takes forever. But it'll all end well. And Alain? Alain looks straight ahead, smiles, digs. Sometimes I wonder if he was born that way or if it was the shock. The world can be unthinkably cruel. Ah, finally! The carnival. -Amazing how fast they set it up. -Yeah. like a plague, they spread across the land. Worn-down rides, bad fast food, and postcards of huge tits on a post. Why is it always Johnny's, Jimmy's, or Tim's Carnival? Why do guys with English names pollute the nation with rusty rides? Are you coming? No, we're going to Hanne's drama society. Traitor. What's worse, Jimmy and Johnny or six hours of a Lars Nor?n play? Well, I'm off to buy a chainsaw. -A chainsaw? -Yeah. The driveway trees block out the light. Don't buy theirs. They're electrical. -I have a new gas-driven saw. -okay. Stop by. Don't you need it? I have two. Excuse me. See you. Johannes speaking. It should be in the file. Take it up with Brit. We'll go over it on Monday. Take care. Bye. Ingvar, married to Anna. No, dependent on Anna. And the town's grand old man. Before they turned the barracks into a refugee camp, he was a Home Guard major, ordering the local young men around. -Johannes? -Ingvar. Ingvar retired as a major, not least because his son did. Not voluntarily, but in the former Yugoslavia with a bullet in his chest. They gave him a medal, even if it was just an accidental shot. The sun is shining. God is good! But Lars drives a truck worth two million. And just dumps it somewhere. Did you check at the Rose? Is he drinking again? We don't talk anymore. It's embarrassing. We celebrate our 500-year anniversary, and they're already reeling around in the beer tent. When they were under my command, they had spines! Say, Anna is with Pernille today, right? They're updating the hymn book. As if it wasn't good enough as it is. God's peace. And to you, Ingvar. "And Denmark's border back to the Eider." Johannes is still smiling. But then, he doesn't know Ingvar's true face. This is the real Ingvar. And why is that? Because Ingvar's grief has devoured his soul from within. The floor's there for your feet, Eske. Comb your hair once in a while, would you? Wouldn't do any good. I'm having a bad hair day. When aren't you? Weksj?, you're a funny man! What's up? 200 kids set Main Street on fire and Al-Qaeda just bombed the stadium. Pizza for lunch? Doesn't your girl make you lunch? This is 2008. only old-timers like you have wives who pack them lunch. -You're reading his file? -Was it Monday? The psychologist approved it. I served Alain the subpoena this morning. What did he say? I had to draw him a picture. Alain here. Denmark here. Alain to there. Bosnia there. He cried like a baby and bolted. Why do they let him roam freely? He's ill. He's cuckoo. When I worked at the refugee camp, no one dared be alone with him. For him, going back will be like being buried alive with his dead family. Enough to drive anybody crazy. I don't get it. Why does the whole world flee to Denmark whenever there's a fire? If my house was on fire, I'd damn well stay and put it out. let's check out the town fair tonight and see if he's there. Sounds dangerous. Yes, you might get candy floss on your collar. Fuck! Fuck, fuck! Alain? What's up? Did you just get here? I'm sorry. No, no. It's okay. It's better than okay. At this pace we can be done this afternoon. You do the work of 10 men. Alain? Alain, are you okay? Yes, yes. -It doesn't clean well enough. -Did you check for soap? -Yes, there's soap in it. -Could it be the filter? How come Matthias gets a cell phone and I don't? How should I know? I'm not a psychic. This is so annoying. Can I, please? Can I, please? Please, pretty please. Please. Please. look, Mom doesn't even have a cell. Look, because she's strange, I can also have one. Know what, Dad? You're a couple of hippies. Real hippies. But your time is almost up, and then we'll take over! What's that? It's for the deck. More tools? Good tools are important with all the work we have to do. Yes? Hello, Ottensten. I'm sure you can handle it. Talk to you later. Pernille! Come on, Pernille. Hi, Lars. Look what the cat dragged in! The sergeant. Fucking hell, what's going on? What's going on? You weren't supposed to be back until Thursday, for fuck's sake! Let's have a round of beers! # My dad was crazy # # My mom was all right # # And as they took him away # # Mama turned, and she said # # "What do we do, little you?" # Hey, are we allowed to smoke in the beer tent? We'll smoke wherever we want. If Lars felt like it, he'd blow smoke up the Environment Secretary's ass. Have you seen the Negro? Why do you ask about the Negro? Didn't he drive a truck in Bosnia? What's up, Benny BB? Hey, I-Lars. You weren't supposed to be home until T-Thursday. Why are you're sweating like a pig? I'm s-setting up the t-tent. Did you hear that F-Fat Finn and F-Funny Boys are coming? F-Fat F-Finn and F-Funny Boys? F-far out, Benny! Are you sure it isn't M-Madonna or BB-BB King? Hell no, they said F-Fat F-Finn and F-Funny Boys. B-Benny BB, fetch some b-beers. Was Scarlett in here yesterday? Was she ever! Your ex-cow... Was she alone? She shot craps with Tonser. Tonser? Yeah, he scored big time. ow, fuck! Dammit, Lars! Lars, no! No! Aah! Aah! Aah! ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! The whole town will be there. We all have a few beers, the kids play around, and there's dancing. You should dance, too. There'll be plenty of girls. Come on. You love music and women in the Balkan as much as we do. Alain? Dancing! Dancing! You should go dancing. Come on. Alain no dance. oh, come on! You're a real Casanova. You're a real Casanova. No, no, no, no, no, no! Me... Alain! I'm not Casanova. Me... Alain. -Alain! -Huh? Come here. Mom! Mom, Daddy and Alain are fags, Mom! Hurry! Don't you love me? What's that supposed to mean? What does that little nod mean? That I love you, dammit. Then why are you fucking Tonser? How the hell does that add up? You don't eat shit if you like caviar, do you? I don't understand. Why are you fucking Tonser? Because I'm drunk and lonely. Because you're drunk and lonely? What the hell kind of answer is that? -And what about the kid? -What about the kid? -Maybe it doesn't like being drunk. -I thought you didn't care. or being fucked by Tonser. This sure ain't gonna be good day. It sure ain't! Tonser would like to be a father to the child. I mean, I never know if you're coming back. I always come back, you little whore. Don't I? And in front of the guys and everything. Can't you just hit me? Hey, hey, Alain! I want to pay you. I owe you. -No! -Yes! We are friends. We're friends. No! No, no! Come on, take it. -Thank you. -Give him the rest. -No. -Here you go. Thank you. Can I have a look? Let me see. Please. They're beautiful. Your wife and children? Where are they? How could I be so stupid! I need to think before I say anything! Don't beat yourself up over it. That poor... Easy, easy. How's it going? Eh, thank you. Are you coming to the town fair? Eh... -Randi? -Yeah. Don't we have some clothes for our big guy here? I'm sure we do. Something dark? -Sounds good. -I'll have a look. Listen, I need to get the truck to the station. You're going to drive it. You are going to drive it! or does your faith prohibit you from driving on a Saturday? Well? You drive truck. But I can't, pal. I've been drinking. I'm shit-faced, man. Listen, Ingvar would kill me. I drive truck! We're lucky. This is my biggest suit. It looks just fine. We'll rule the tent, Randi. -Shoes? -Yes. -And a white shirt. -Yes. Woah! Check in when you get back. I'll be in the beer tent. Thank you, Lars! Thank you. We're truckers. Brothers! Brothers! Brothers! You pervert, Noller! Some fuck women, others fuck men. Noller fucks the ones on all fours who go "Baaah". Hey, they don't demand alimony. Lars? I knew I'd find you here. Why haven't you checked in? -I did. -In this condition? -Ingvar, I had someone else do it. -Someone else? I'd been driving non-stop. I had a few beers with the guys. It's Saturday. So I found it irresponsible to get behind the wheel of a 30-ton truck. So who's got the truck now? The Negro. The Negro? The Bosnia beast. Alain. The Negro? I have nothing against blacks. Africans are a people of culture with an intelligence to match ours. Negro is simply linguistics expressing that he's different. He's a fucking Muslim. From down there. But hell, he's a human being nonetheless. I don't pay you to -- Ingvar, he used to be a truck driver. He was just like you. And he's a fucking careful driver. To be so drunk that others must do your work... Ingvar, the man lost everything. All he does is dig holes for Johannes. He deserves a chance. I know you think so, too. You don't vote for -- You've got heart. A Christian heart! We all know that. Even if he is a fucking Muslim, refugee, Negro, Paki or whatever. I don't want to see you again, Lars. Is that why Leif Christensen is here? Why do you think he's here? Because you don't have the guts to fire me without him. You can pick up your wages on Monday. Yes, Major, sir! Your father worked himself into an early grave for his two sons. But he didn't do it entirely in vain. At least Johannes made something of himself. Don't mess with the major, man. You know what, Roald? I don't give a shit. -You know why? -No. Why? -'Cause I'm getting married. -Married? Who to? To that! You're kidding! You're kidding! You're marrying that?! Yeah! -Kiss the bride! -let's kiss the bride! -Beer's on me! -Pussy! Come grab a beer, Lars! -Hi, Uncle Lars! -What the...? I heard you were here. Hi, Lars. Hi, Fred! Let's try the bumper cars. -Uncle is too drunk to drive. -When did that ever stop you? Hi, Pernille. You look great. They say that married couples start to look alike, much like when you have an ugly dog and turn ugly yourself. But you look amazing. Is this your girlfriend? Hi, I'm Pernille. We're getting married. Wow. Scarlett's got a bun in the oven, so we're getting a TV and a couch. Congratulations. Isn't that wonderful? Hey, you, give me a jab. Is that the best you can do? -Did you hurt yourself? -It's nothing. Nothing? It's just 'cause I fucked another guy. -Have you got enough money? -We have a hundred each. one hundred? Your dad's such a miser. one, two, three. You come to Uncle if you need more. Give me a kiss. Have fun, you brats! Go try stuff, dammit! Wait! Ingvar is looking for you. Fuck you. So you did check in the truck? Fuck you. I had your friend to do it. Who? I had Alain bring it in. You did what? Fuck you. We'll get mad cow disease. Can I get you something else? Raw pork or charred beef? -let's dance. -Huh? Let's dance! To that? There isn't much of a man left in you. Are you trying to tell me something? Aah! -Hello, you two. -Hello. Hello, Ingvar. I thought Anna was with you. Isn't she with you? Was that the plan? We'll just do it tomorrow. Didn't she show up at your place? I figured she didn't consider it set in stone. But... she left this morning carrying all the hymns. Where is she? Where could she be? You better go with him. Feet off the ground! No, no, no! Friends! In the presence of the finer layers of society -- presidents, counts, and dukes, TV stars, pop artists, and superstars -- Please allow me to propose a toast to my bride to be. "What the hell is he on about? Those losers aren't good for anything." Shut the fuck up, Simon Cowell! They're my goddamn friends! And they're not voted out yet! "And what about that little slut? All she's good for is servicing a morning boner." Shut your mouth! Shut it! She's my wife! She's mine! She moved on, goddammit! She's fucking moving on! Hey! We're all fucking moving on! Cheers! So, Pernille? So, Lars? Your husband won't dance with you? I have to go and find the kids. -I have to go and find the kids. -They're having fun. I haven't seen them for a long time. They're having fun. -Shouldn't you be dancing with her? -Who? The girl you beat up. She beats me up, too. But afterwards we fuck like we're on cloud nine. Stop it, Lars. It could've been you and me, Pernille. Then we wouldn't just have two great kids. We'd have four or five. I would worship you like a goddess, and we'd fuck 12 times a day. Stop it, Lars! I always talk crap! My thoughts are beautiful, Pernille. They are. But when they come out, they turn into crap. I want to say "flower", but my mouth says "crap". I want to say "beautiful", but this says "puke"! It comes out all wrong. I have to find the kids. Pernille! It was my mouth again! What? What's going on? What?! What's going on? I wish we were different people! I'm right here, you asshole! I'm right here! We're here, dammit, Lars! Aah! Woooo! We always talked on the phone several times every day. Anna looks out for me, you see. I wouldn't be human without her. Ingvar. Why do we have to go already? Dad is staying! -We are going home. -We don't want to go home! I'll get rid of him. No. Wait. Wait. Brother. Here. Hey! Cheers! -Hey! -No, no. This is how we have a good time. This is how we have a good time. -okay. -Go on. There you go. Berit! -Berit! Sign him up! -What can I do for you? What? Who? -Negro Alain! -Sign him up for what? -The beer contest, dammit. -How does he spell it? N for Negro! Ingvar, we have to call. oh, no. No, no. Anna! No! My little Anna. Is he going for help? I'll make the call. No, Johannes. But we should call for help! Who do you want to help? Yeah! Now, boys and girls! Ready for the last round? We have Tonser on stage! Little Verner! And in between the two, Negro Alain! Give him a big hand! Get ready for the countdown! We say 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1 ! Go! And I think we have a winner! Tonser, ladies and gentlemen! Tonser downed it in five seconds! Fantastic. You can do it! And I think little Verner is almost there! Yeah! We have little Verner at 20 seconds, ladies and gentlemen. Let's see how Negro Alain does. Negro! Negro! Negro! Negro! Negro! Negro! And spring came. And summer. And fall. And winter. 3... 2... 1 ! Yeah! # I am a lucky guy # # I've got perfect style # # I look a little different # # And I stick out for a mile # # And I know that they're all thinking # # "This guy has got a quirky side" # # But I can dance to any tune # # I sway and swing and slide # # I know my limitations # The lord speaks to us every day, Johannes. Don't you ever hear him? You know, Anna was the angel sent by the lord to watch over me. Do you know what that means? What does it mean, Ingvar? What does it mean, Ingvar? Who is going to guard the demon now? Take it easy, Roald! Get out of my way. Fuck you, little Negro! Move! You little Negro! I'll fucking cut you! I am dead. Anna is no more. So neither am I. The only one left is he who killed us. The remains of Anna are out there in the truck that killed her. And in this tent her murderer is celebrating. -You bastard! -Brothers! I trusted you, man! Lars? What? Lars, goddamit! Stop it! Stop! Yeah, Leif Christensen, get him! Please don't, Leif Christensen. There's no need for this, Ingvar. Ingvar! It's all my fault, Ingvar. I'm sorry, Ingvar. I trusted him. Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. only two people could have done it, Lars. No way! I damn well know how to drive a truck. Do you think that I...? What's that? oh, God. Ingvar! Stop that! Ingvar, dammit! Ingvar! Dammit! No, no! No! And this taught you nothing?! No! No! No! He confessed! Let's get the cops. You're a fine bunch! Come, Alain. Where are you going? Tell the police he's at my place. There goes the murderer and his friend. What was that? Mr. Stuck-Up Big-Shot Asshole. Intelligent, Roald. Brilliant. -You pathetic loser. -What? Just because you're a bum, and I have a family, a job, and a life, I should feel guilty? For what? That? I've spent an entire life trying to avoid turning into you. Who hasn't? Loser! Fuck you and your welfare benefits. You're the loser, man! Fucking asshole! S-smartass! Fuck you! You're a dead man! Filthy rich pig! Come. Fuck, the car. What? You've got the wrong number. This is the weather service. We need the police. -Alain, did you run her over? -The address is 1 T?rnfalkevej. I knew it! T?rnfalkevej number 1 . Right away. You have the wrong -- Thank you. They're on their way. This is whipped cream, for crying out loud! I wanted hot fudge, you old coot. The beer tent is empty. I hate this artificial crap. What the hell do they put in it? Why aren't they in the beer tent? Like old sperm. Yuck! What the hell am I doing? -Why? -What? Why aren't they in the beer tent? They've had a very hard workday. They've been drinking non-stop since they got out of bed at 11:00. 32 responding. We have a code 924 near the hills. We'll get right on it. over and out. A break-in. over by the hills. The cabins. Who's out there this time of year? Anna! Help me, help me! He's inside now, all warm and cozy, sitting in the chair meant for Anna. Drinking her coffee and eating her cookie. Why did he come here? Why didn't he stay where he belongs? What did we defend to the point of sacrificing our lives? The white cross and the Danish coastlines. We never wanted war. We didn't want war! We swept it from our doorstep. We even sent our children to help defend them and their children. The cops will deal with him. The cops will deal with him, Ingvar. But to them, life holds no value. Ingvar, let's get that Negro. Yeah. We're obliged to defend ourselves. Yes! When they come here and kill our women and children, we just stand here and do nothing? I say let's get that Negro, Ingvar. Yeah! The lord speaks no more. The lord is silent. The lord calls upon us to speak. Shall we accept? Shall we accept? Hell, yeah! Shall we accept? Yeah! That's good. That's it. He was carrying this. Did you call the police? Ingvar broke my phone. But Leif Christensen called it in. Leif Christensen? I'd better make the call. I left my phone in the car. Hey there, good Doctor. Get out of my way, Roald. Move! Where do you think you're going? You reek! I could get drunk from inhaling your breath. Don't drive in your condition. Go home. The party's over! Where do you think you're going? Thomsen! What's up, Lars? You'd better not! Don't touch that cell phone. Don't you touch it! Are you crazy? You'd better not. Stop it! -Don't touch that phone. -It's the vodka, Thomsen. Do you hear? Do as he says! Do you hear me? Put down the phone! It's Thomsen. We have a problem out here. No! Fuck, he's bleeding. He's bleeding like crazy, Ingvar. Then let him fix himself. He's a doctor, isn't he? Ingvar. Think! Bring him outside, Johannes. You must call for help, Ingvar! He shot at me. He shot at me! Frederik, go up to your room. Frederik and Viola, go to your rooms! Alain! No, no, no! Upstairs, come. Aaaah! Upstairs. Are you okay? Sure. Why do you ask if I'm okay? of course I am. Why wouldn't I be? Is it a nice movie? Is it fun? I've seen it 20 times. Then it must be. What are we going to do? They're not getting in here. No way. This is complete lunacy. Someone will call soon. I think Thomsen had time to... And the alarm... Someone's bound to hear it. And if not? What? What does this have to do with us? What? He's the one they want to talk to. What do you mean? Are we supposed to...? We can't. Why should we? Just because he... What are you saying? Why doesn't he go and talk to them? They'd kill him, for Christ's sake! Yeah! Hey! Stop it! Stop it! You're not getting in! First man through the door is dead meat! Dead meat? Are we dead meat? I have a nail gun! He says he has a nail gun. ooh, watch out! He'll build a garage if we don't leave! Leif Christensen! Does it hurt? Fetch some tools. Fetch some tools! Tools! Fetch some tools! Ingvar. Let's go home. Let's go home and call the police. There are certain rules, Ingvar. Not for terrorists. Gasoline! What are you doing? What are you doing with the lamp? Gitte and Bent gave that to us. It was a wedding present. Have you gone mad? Don't do it! Next one. What the hell is the good doctor up to? Shouldn't you be eating a steak and drinking fancy Barolo with the rich instead of sitting here pissing all over the leather upholstery? You're embarrassing yourself, good Doctor. "I know." "I know, Roald." "I know." Not to insult you, Doctor, but you look somewhat poorly tonight. But what do I know? I'm nobody. I'm just the nobody from the Rose. "From the Rose." But let me tell you something, good Doctor. I couldn't fucking care less. I'm not the one bleeding. Nothing. No one makes prank calls about stuff like that. It's not funny. Hello, Kramer. Who called it in? okay. Yes. Yes. That's odd. Yes. Yes, thanks. Well? Thomsen called. The doctor. Kramer says he sounded stressed. Then there was a bang. And he disappeared. Disappeared? But the phone is still on, and there's rock music playing in the background. Rock music? They're tracing the call. Dad? I'm scared. Frederik. Frederik. Do you remember when we went sailing and those big waves came? And I told you that if you get scared, the waves just get even bigger. Frederik. Dad will look out for you, okay? Nothing is going to happen, sweetie, okay? okay? Dad will look out for you. Frederik? Come here. Go to your sister. Are we all -- Are we all going to die for him? What do you suggest we do? Send him out there. What? We should send him out there. Those bastards are not coming in. Alain didn't flee the bastards there just to face the bastards here. No matter the cost? I'll wipe out the fucking bastards. I'll kill every one of those goddamn proletarians! You're enjoying this. You get a kick out of it. You're an animal just like them. Don't do it. He's the one they want. Not us. Ingvar. We would like to leave. The lady would like to be pardoned. So the lady wants to leave? The lady would like to be pardoned? Come here! Do you know that you have a very pretty mom? What's going on here? our Father who art in Heaven. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation... ...but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory... ...for ever and ever. Amen. Roald. Why are you protecting him? This man buried his family in Bosnia. He came here to find peace. Did you do anything, Alain? Tell us where you were this morning, Alain. Tell us what happened today, Alain. Anna just wanted to comfort Alain. What is he talking about? So you murdered Anna on the road? Alain walked on the road. Anna just wanted to comfort. Weksj? said he broke down and walked out the door crying. Ingvar. It was me. I accept the blame. No, Ingvar. Ingvar, no. Please don't, Ingvar! Ingvar, no, don't! Ingvar, no! No, Ingvar! Alain hold Anna firmly. But Anna fall. Fuck. Do you have bullets, Leif Christensen? I asked you if you have any bullets! Get some from the car. Go get some bullets from the car, Leif Christensen! She's going to having a kid. That child isn't going to be without a father. Pernille? Frederik? Pernille! I thought there was a road here. Pernille, get over here now! Pernille! Mommy? Pernille! Do as I say. Do as I say now! I'll be back soon. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! The family fled. Like so many others, not knowing to where or what. But sometimes you have to flee the demons. Scarlett had a beautiful child. Pernille and Johannes never had any more. But they held on to each other for the rest of their lives. And that's it. That's it!
