How was it? - I liked it. (woman laughing) Atmospherics were tight, motion was naturalistic. And, yeah, Valery was hot. - White's getting impatient. Conference room? - Five minutes. (woman giggling) The host, Valery, how'd you do that? She looked like this girl I nailed in high school. - Well, I referenced your high school year book, pulled all the atmospherics off it. - All right, the sound. Did you tweak the amplitude settings? - Self-induced neural transference. You were really feeling it. - Hey, don't get cute and play around with the settings while my ass is sitting in the chair, you got me? - Sure, Lou, it's your show. - Looks medieval. Two people are gonna have sex with this thing and enjoy it? - Virtual sex, sir. And, yes, they'll both enjoy it. - All right. I want the program ready in one week. - It can't be done, we just finished dry runs. - We have to screen for applicants and put them through exams. - Well run the tests on yourselves. Be your own guinea pigs. If Virtucom can be traded publicly by this quarter's end, we'll have a heap of funding by next quarter. - We shouldn't railroad this into production without complete testing. We could overlook other possible applications. - Such as? - What if the VR program could be used to help those with sexual problems or dysfunctions? - Sex is entertainment. Sex is profit. - Amen, Pick. Nice thoughts, Miss Tessia, but I just wanna have people put our headsets on, sit back and let them dry hump us all the way to the bank. (White chuckling) All right, you got one week. Can you handle it? Or do I bring in designers who can? - We can handle it. We'll have it ready for you next week. - Good. Because I've already picked the city where we will launch our program. - Las Vegas, what a joke. - That's the call, Sharon. Now White and Pickford set up a deal with the Plaza Hotel downtown. Call them up, talk to a guy named Kevin Pallone, okay? Look, Sharon, Las Vegas makes perfect sense. - What are we making here, the digital hooker? (Lou chuckling) (exciting saxophone music) ♪ It was Saturday night, about half past eight ♪ ♪ I was cruising PCH in my 78 ♪ (quirky band music) - Thanks. We'll call. ♪ Driving all night ♪ ♪ Driving all night ♪ - You look at the file I sent you? - Yeah, I can bring it up for you right now. - I don't need to see that, Kevin. Only your department of Vincent Attractions is losing money and it's really simple. Guests gamble. They see the shows and they gamble some more, spending all their time and money here. - I know how it works, I do have something coming in. A virtual pleasures program. A company from LA is gonna bring it out and let us test drive. - Well I don't care if they light their farts on fire. Just fill these seats. All of them! Pack the place, Kevin, or pack up your office. (melancholy music) (somber bongo music) (electronic chiming) (computer beeping) - Well, you'll need to take your glasses off for this. - It feels weird already. - So, Leah, it says here you're looking for a tropical fantasy. - Yeah. - I think you're gonna like it.

I hear they're talking about bonuses and stock options for both of us. - We're going too fast. Something will trip us up. We need to slow down and keep the testers around for a full numerological examination. - We start the onsites in Las Vegas in three days. - Lou, I'm talking about people's health here. - People don't care about their health, they wanna feel good. Look, the company's throwing a party at White's house tomorrow night. You really should try and attend. - Okay. - We're building a virtual reality attraction that is gonna make you and me and Virtucom an embarrassing amount of money. You still with me all the way on this? - Yeah, I'm with you. (pleasant music) (electronic whooshing) (suspenseful music) (computer chiming) (somber guitar music) (crickets chirping) - Sharon, what is this? - Valery took the night off. Thought I'd give you a special present. Me. (Lou chuckling) - Sharon, this isn't right. - Oh, it's more than right. It's perfect. Your favorite car, favorite music. Favorite assistant.

(siren alarming) (suspenseful music) (dial tone buzzing) (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) - Miss Tessia? You brought in Mr. Burke? - Is he gonna be okay? - Unfortunately, it doesn't look good. Neurological scans show brain trauma, possible damage. - Oh my God. - But his seizures have stopped and we have him stabilized for now. Hopefully he'll wake up and tell us what happened. - I hope so. - The last thing he does remember is driving to Virtucom and having sex with a woman named Valery. - That's impossible. I found him in the supermarket parking lot 10 blocks from here. He looked terrible, so I put him in my car. - Well, he's lucky to be alive and he has you to thank for that. (shredder buzzing) (dramatic music) (computer beeping) (Pickford chattering) - Soon as the appointment gets finished, we'll get over there. - [White] Yeah, good, good. - Good morning, Sharon. I was just telling White here that you and Burke just about finished the VR testing. - Mmmm. - Congratulations, Sharon. Sorry we pinched the clock on you. We relied on your ability to get it ready in time. - Thank you. - By the way, have you seen Burke this morning? He's supposed to be here for a meeting. - No, I haven't. (ominous music) - Is there a problem, Sharon? - No, why? - Miss Tessia? Is something wrong with the VR testing? Well? Do we have a problem? - I think it's covered. A little hangup with the sync codes. Should be fine now. - Oh, good. Come on, Pick, we'll start without Burke. (ominous music) (upbeat music) ♪ Time for discovery ♪ ♪ Time for revelry ♪ ♪ Time for the lonely one ♪ ♪ To find another one ♪ (people chattering) - Can we have your attention? Here comes the good news. Pick any year, from the ice age to the space age, whatever your desires, the Virtucom VR sex program gives customers a safe, customized and gratifying sexual experience. Imagine sex anytime, anywhere you want it with no risk of pregnancy or transmitted diseases. Of course, every VR unit will be checked for computer viruses, so-- - We need to talk, now! - Sharon, I'm in the middle of a presentation here. - Do you want me to make a presentation? (ominous music) - Excuse me. (people chattering) - Burke's galvinate impulses were calibrated. I don't know why the program overrides didn't kick in sooner. - Sharon, your timing is awful. - Look, I tried to tell you earlier. - Well, we can kiss Vegas and the next production quarter goodbye. We were doing so well. - Hey, I didn't build this thing alone. This is you, me, Virtucom, everybody. - What are we all supposed to do now, scrap the whole thing? What do I tell the investors, our contractors? - The truth. That Virtucom needs more testing to make sure it's absolutely safe. Our VR sex program put a guy in the hospital. - No, Sharon, you put a guy in the hospital. (sinister music) Sorry about that. (electronic fizzling) (computer chiming) Didn't mean to come off like an asshole last night. We're hall under a heap of pressure here. Any word on Burke? - No change. Still in ICU. However, I've fixed the galvanick inlays so they won't go ballistic again. Came in early this morning, wrote new inlay codes. It was simple to fix, only took me 15 minutes. See here? When the inlay sends a respiratory or cardio increase, this flow circuit automatically opens up. - Which means the VR users won't cook their bacon. - I've backed up the fail safe with a shadow program. - You did good work, Sharon. And you're fired. - You're serious? (ominous music) - This is your last monthly plus severance and your share of Virtucom stock options. I'll take the VR sex protect to Las Vegas myself and find a new assistant on site. - This is my work. Virtucom is using my VR patent. You can't just cut me loose because of what happened to Burke! - And what if Burke dies, Sharon? Then what? - I don't know. I pray that he doesn't. - This is your mess and this is how we're gonna clear it up. - Right. And you get to keep my VR patents while I take the bullet. - That's the deal, Sharon, I'm sorry. Oh, I've got a meeting. Look, us the rest of the day to clear your stuff out of the lab. (ominous music) (crickets chirping) (somber music) - The logins show Burke's VR program start to slip and the sensorium caused palpitation increased and neural receptive trauma. - Burke might have had some hidden medical or neurological condition none of us knew about. But it's fixed now. - Why didn't you catch the slippage? You were watching him, weren't you? - I did step away for a minute. Look, we're dealing with a machine and a program none of us fully understand yet. I shouldn't have left Burke alone. I made a mistake. - A very costly one. - You just fired me, why am I here? (foreboding music) - We may have been a but hasty with our decision to terminate you. - With respect to Burke's untimely demise, we're obligated somehow to put the program back on track. - Should've thought of that before you canned me and tried to rip off my VR program patents. - What if we gave you patents back and doubled you holdings in the company? - It'd say you were desperate to debut the VR sex program in Las Vegas. - You're the only one besides Burke who knows how to run it. - Seems to be a question of how bad you need me.

I'm ready to set up, could use a hand. - Sure. (upbeat music) Let's go. Lounges, swimming pools, golf and tennis courts aren't enough to compete with the big houses anymore. Every major casino has some sort of water ride, rollercoaster or amusement park-type attraction. Where do grownups go? Like grownup games. - Hmmm, let me guess, card tables and slot machines? - Obviously but they want more. We give everything from Swedish rubdowns to clay tennis courts but it's not enough. As Vegas grows, real estate's gonna become a serious, expensive issue and virtual theme parks are the answer. - Hmmm. Don't worry, it won't bite unless I program it to. The chair and the headset take on the sensual impulses from this console. As real as it may seem, it's all just circuits and inlays. - I have a girlfriend, and Molly and I, we don't get too crazy. Keep it in the bedroom, lights out. - Okay. Do you have a picture of her? - Yeah. Here. - She's pretty. You must feel lucky, huh? - [Kevin] I suppose I am. - The rodoscanner takes two dimensional images and replicates them into full dimension. This is how we build the atmospherics. Well, what do you think? Look good? - I guess so. - Okay, maybe you'd like to try this with someone else. (computer chiming) See anything you like? (computer buzzing) Passion. So, what would you and Passion like to do for fun? You know, kinky thrill sexcapades. (Kevin chuckling) - Like I said, I'm no lover boy but I have always had this fantasy about taking Molly into the boss's office. - Nappa's office? (Sharon laughing) I think I can work with that.

The amount of transference varies from user to user. - This is gonna be huge. - I wrote the program myself. Coded all the atmospherics. - It's brilliant. Sharon, we'll give you whatever you need.

And who runs this virtual sex machine? - The designer, the woman who built it. - A woman? (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Come on, Molly. It's just a machine. It's like, I don't know, if you used a machine like a vibrator. - No, no, it is not the same thing and I have never used one of those. - Maybe you should start. (Molly chuckling) (dramatic music) (computer beeping) (computer chiming) (computer keys clicking) - Kevin, are you out of your freaking mind? We can't come up with these numbers. - Why not? The casino is expanding the hotel suits and adding a second gaming floor. Lump it in with the renovation costs. - Kevin, forget the cost. What about the possible litigation nightmare? Can you imagine if some parent finds out that their kid put the VR headset on? - We'll ID everyone, verify their age. - I don't like it. What if some old-timer tries the headset on and dies of a stroke? His family's gonna sue us for millions and probably win. - We'll cover ourselves with a waiver, free us from liability. - I don't know. (Kevin sighing) - Look, if this thing goes big, and I think it will, you're gonna be happy you spent the money. - And if it doesn't? - Then I'm fired and you can book old magicians and washed-up lounge singers for the rest of the summer. - Hardly encouraging. - Neither one of you has tried it.

Bullshitted my way through the interview and here I am, booking has-beens for the casino lounge. I don't know. Molly's happy, she has friends here, but... I feel stuck. - Sounds like you're bored already. - With what, the job or Molly? (Sharon chuckling) - I meant the job. - Right. I knew that. (Kevin sighing) All right, I'll admit it.

Seeing anyone? - Kevin. - Come on, you know my deal. - Well, I was seeing someone before I came out here but it ended. - What happened? - Nothing, it just ended. - [Kevin] Sounds like it ended badly, right? - I don't like to talk about it, Kevin. - Sorry.

(dramatic music) (airplane whooshing) - His insurance companies hired a private investigator to find out exactly what happened to Mr. Burke and who should pay for it. The man is unresponsive and withdrawn. And he's partially blind in his right eye. - All right. One, I'll take care of all of Burke's hospital bills. And two, I get one shot at treating Burke, no questions asked. - You can't touch him. - Look, I'm a person of science, you're a person of medicine, right? - Well, I am a medical doctor and I don't really know who you are. - Well, it's obvious you've exhausted your medical means to treat him. - Admit it, you've tried everything. - Our attempts at treating Mr. Burke are none of your concern. - Just say it for the sake of the patient, you've done all you can. - Well, we have tried everything, yes. (heart monitor beeping) What exactly will that do? - We're going to install a medicinal program. - It's like a virtual doctor. - Okay, look, I'm gonna finish my rounds and if he reacts adversely to the treatment, you call me immediately.

I know how he really ended up in the hospital. See, you might have gotten rid of his VR program but when the program malfunctions, it leaves behind a vitals template. Your little secret just got very expensive to keep. - White and Pickford? - Know everything, they're in my corner. - Oh, so you're the new errand boy? They want my program, right? - For starters?

Besides, Kevin trusts me, don't you? - Yeah. - Of course you do. Let's see. How about the office program? What do you say, Kevin? Sound good? (electronic whooshing) - Oh my God, Kevin. I can feel you, can you feel me? - Yeah. (pleasant music) - You didn't do this with her, did you? I mean, in here? - I already told you, I was in here with you. - Okay.

I had no idea Sharon was gonna pull that crap with the VR program. Will you just stop and listen to me for a second? - You think you and your little sex computer's funny? That kinky coworker slobbering all over me, ugh. - It was just a game, a simulation. - A game? It sure didn't feel like a game and it definitely wasn't a game when I woke up alone and you woke up in a hotel! - She must've cut in somehow and kept the VR program going. - Right, you're a creep, Kevin. Stay the hell away from me. (somber beat music) - Excuse me. I need a business suit with a modem and T-1 lines. - Sure. - Kevin, we have customers waiting. You have empty VR chairs, what's the problem? - Sharon. She's reprogrammed the VR access codes by remote. I can't turn it on. (phone ringing) - How long have they been down? - All morning. (phone ringing) Hello? Funny. Reprogram and give me access to the VR console right now or we go to the police with Burke's accident. - Go tell them we're taking care of it. Where are you Sharon? - Nappa, I'm not surprised you got into bed with White and Pickford. - Sharon, be smart about this. We hold incriminating information. You hold the VR program patents. It's that simple. - Stealing is simple, even for patsies like you. The VR machine stays off today, all day, all week. I'll turn it back on when you guys start playing fair. - [Nappa] Sharon! (dial tone buzzing) - [Kevin] Well? - Can you get access to the VR program without her or not? (phone ringing) - With an extra CPU and data drives, I may have a shot. (phone ringing) - Get started. Hello? - Our arrangement stays the same. If Kevin can download the VR systems and programs, I don't see any more need for Miss Tessia's services. - I'll make a call. - Make it clean, no mistake, she's a slippery fish. - Don't worry about it. (ominous music) (heart monitor beeping) (computer chiming) (ominous tempo music) (somber music) (computer beeping) How's it coming? - We're downloading. In about an hour I should have the whole program files and the sensoriams maximum. - Call me when you got the whole thing. (foreboding music) (computer beeping) - Kevin, you little snake. (foreboding music) (suspenseful music) (slot machine cranking) (computer beeping) (suspenseful music) (computer chiming) (suspenseful music) (door thudding) (ominous music) - Too late, Sharon, but you had to go and play games with the access codes. Now you have nothing. (ominous music) - Sharon, please, you're in the middle of a casino. My casino. I could have security in here in a heartbeat. Finish downloading. I'm getting security and you do what you have to do. (gunshot booming) (intense music) - [Guard] Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! - Next time, I won't miss. Now Kevin, unhook your data drives from my VR deck. - And destroy your own machine? - Better me than you. Now unhook them now. (ominous music) (gunshot booming) (man groaning) (people screaming) (suspenseful music) (gunshot booming) - Don't move, sir! - I'm George Nappa, casino owner! That woman is a thief and a murderer! - [Guard] We'll sort it out when the police get here. - [Announcer] Casino owner George Nappa has been taken into custody and held for questioning. The authorities may finally have the goods on the very famous mob boss. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Miss Tessia, I've got some news for you about Mr. Burke. He's fine. (doctor chuckling) Fully recovered. We waltzed right on out of here this morning. - 100 percent? No more lingering seizures or synaptic traumas? - None! He get full vision back in his right eye too. I am impressed. Your virtual doctor did exactly what you said it would do. How did you do it? - Doctor, remember our deal? - Yeah, yeah, no questions. - [Sharon] Thank you for letting me treat him. I'll call you when I get back. - [Doctor] Bye, bye.
