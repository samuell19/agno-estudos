I, Tom Martinez, as a free Aryan man, hereby swear an unrelenting oath upon the green graves of our sires, upon the children in the wombs of our many wives, upon the throne of god almighty, sacred by his name, to join together in holy union with my brothers in this circle. From this moment, I have the sacred duty to do what is ever necessary to deliver our people from the Jew and bring total victory to the Aryan race. Let me bear witness to you, my brothers, that should an enemy agent hurt you, I will chase him to ends of the earth and remove his head from his body. Hail victory! When I was a little girl, I used to dream that I was a Princess dressed in silk and satin. I dreamed about castles and magical white horses. I dreamed about love, true love, and I imagined that my life would be like a wonderful fairytale. Tom was going to be my knight in shining armor, and our love, pure and strong, was the only thing either of US would ever need. Wasn't sure you'd meet me. Told you I would, didn't I? You gotta have faith. what about, bora bora? No? Tahiti? I mean, come on, Tahiti? Look at that beach. You ever seen sand so clean? Tom... Man. Is that water blue or what! This is where we go on our honeymoon. You ever gonna finish this thing? Got any plans? Get a job, I guess. I was thinking... My buddy ryerson, he could probably find you a spot. Great. Good enough for you, it's good enough for me. Tom! Yeah? Come on, I need to talk to you. What's up? I gotta let you go. What? Business is off. I'm sorry, Tom. Man, who didn't check out Celia at that party, man? You see the way she was looking at ...? Whatever, man. Later, man. Hey, check out this dude. Yo, white boy be buggin'. Damn, he's running low! Yeah, nigger need to be hooked up to a new game. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. I spoke to your dad today. He can't wait for the baby to come. A-and I looked at some cribs. I found one I really like. Yeah? How much? It's too much. Sure. Things will get better. How? You'll see. When the baby comes... When the baby comes, it's just gonna be another mouth to feed. Don't you get it? Y-You want this baby, don't you? Don't you? Susan, what do you want me to say? It's not like we planned it for chrissake, right? Susan, come on. What do you want from me? What do I want? How about we talk once in a while? How's about we talk about the baby's name or, like, why don't we go out? I can't even remember the last time we went out to see a movie or... it's work, Susan! Work! Get it? For chrissake, I'm a goddamn janitor! I'm sorry. I know you don't like your job. Like it? Try hate it. I hate the way they look at me. I hate their eyes. I hate what my life has become. Well, you're not having too much luck, are you? Luck? Getting drunk? I guess not. Well, you're not the only one. Who what, can't get drunk? You're not the only white man who's getting a bad rap. Look, pal, I don't know what you're selling, but... I'm not selling nothing. I'm just trying to explain to you it doesn't have to be that way. Politics. It's all bullshit. Tell you what. There's a bunch of US. We're having a little get-together. Yeah? Yeah, just some regular guys, might have a little something in common. What do you got to lose? Hey, Tom, glad you could make it. I want to introduce you to all these guys. Just one thing... your name, Martinez? What about it? Yeah, what is that? Spanish. Family's from Spanish nobility. Really? Yeah. Okay, I want you to meet these guys. Guys, I want you to meet Tom Martinez. He's a friend of mine. Reverend miles and... Welcome. Robert, Larry. Charlie, Richard. All you guys. How are you? Reverend, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Just go ahead, reverend. Now, is anything wrong with being proud of your race, your religion? No, sir. Of course not. But when we say it, we're called racists, hatemongers. When they say it, it's called black pride. That's right. Why, they're going to be teaching it in the universities before too long. Now, I say it's time for the white man to stand proud. Yes, sir. I say it's time for US to tell the zionist-occupied government that we won't pay for drug addicts to get high. No, sir. We won't pay for their women to have one baby after another. And we won't pay them not to work. We won't do it because it's not fair. You listening to me? Yes, sir. It's not complicated. Say to yourselves, "it's not fair." It's not fair. Tom, what are you doing? Nothin'. How's your... How was your nap? Good. What's all that stuff? All that and more. All that and more. The baby is kicking up a storm. Yeah? Here. Feel. Hey! I felt that. All right! Hey, come on. Sit down here. You all right? Hey. I want to tell you something. We're going to be all right. Yeah? Yeah. We're going to be all right. How you doing, Mrs. Holcomb? Making ends meet. Here, this is for you. Great. Thanks a lot. See you soon. Where's Mr. Potter? Moved. What you want, man? You got a difficulty, man? You better believe it... Man. Sweetie. Aw, sweetie. It's all right. Hey, Walter! Hey, hey, hey! How you doin'? Wow! What's this? Here they are. Hey, Susan, how you doing? Here you go. My god, is that beautiful! I don't know how to thank you guys. Aw, don't think me. It was Bob's idea. Bob mathews, right? That's right. Great. My wife Susan. Hi. Little girl Diane. Susan, it's a pleasure. Well, hello, Diane. You're a lovely little girl. Why? Because you're a good man, Tom. You raise money for the movement, recruit new members. You and your family deserve it. Bob's starting a new group. A cell. What's... Wrong with the one we got? Well, the reverend miles is a good man, don't get me wrong, but he's all talk. We need action. We need action now. You gonna join? Yeah. Lot of others, too. Hey, buddy, you want a better life for your little girl? You know I do. Well, then come on up to god's country and see what we're building. I promise you, you won't be disappointed. Aw, Tom, she's beautiful. Thanks. That's how we came to metaline falls in Washington state. Bob Matthew's father had bought him a few hundred acres of land, and that's where Bob began to build his private world. You like this place? Ha! You kidding? What's not to? Well, then, you'll join US? Moving a little fast, Bob. Well, we have to. Things getting any better back home? Well... Your job? My job, that's funny. Just got fired. What happened? Affirmative action. There's nothing affirmative about that. I'm sorry. Well, you see why we're in a hurry. Bob, what would I have to do? Take an oath of allegiance. W-With the group, though. I mean, what are you gonna do? Stand up for yourself, protect your family. Anything wrong with that? Let's go. Let's go. Batter up. Come on, guys, let's get it together. No guts, no glory. In the beginning, there were the core members... Larry Martin, he was amazing. There wasn't anything he couldn't build or fix. Robert Maxim, he was an expert counterfeiter. Charlie Higgins loved guns, totally crazy. There was no telling what he would do. Richard Parker, they say he read every book that was ever written. Of course, there was Walter west. Tom said that Walter idolized Bob mathews, thought he was god. Go get 'em, Tom go get 'em, man! And there was Jean Craig and her daughter, zillah. She was always reading the Bible. And Bob mathews, our friend. Martinez, up to bat! He's got nothing! He's got nothing! Here it comes, now, Tom. Get ready. Play some first! He's got nothing. Back! Back! Back! Back! Whoo! That's my man! Rest of the way, Tom! Rest of the way! Come on, come on! Tag him! Throw it! Come on! Go, Tom! Get him out! Whoa, Mr. Martinez packs a wallop! Good! Your little girl. How was your meeting? Great. Yeah? Just great. All right, fellas, come on. Get a bat. I'm off. Mwah. Did you hear that piece of vermin on the radio? Who? Berg. It's time to splash some yid blood around. Careful. What gastronomic delight can I bring you fellas? Apple pie and milk all around. No, I don't like apple pie. How about... apple pie? It's an American tradition! Well, yeah, but... No, no buts about it. We're all gonna have milk and apple pie. Well, how about I bring some cherry pie, instead? Well, how about you do just like this man said and bring a round of milk and apple pie! Thank you. Think of it as part of the discipline you'll need to carry out your missions. But apple pie makes me sick. You need training, west, lots of it. Hell's bells. Man! Poor guy. Hey, maybe I'd ought to go get him a napkin or something? Sit down. But in the old days, I think in tombstone, they had what they called a vigilante committee. They solved their problems all by themselves. It's just not viable, Robert. We can't just go out and do what we please. There are local and federal authorities that have that jurisdiction. You sound like a Jew lawyer. Richard's not Jewish. He's insulting me, Walter. The point is, we don't recognize local or federal authorities because they're illegal. They're tools of the Cosmopolitan. Yeah, but what can you do? I mean, they're there and they're powerful, right? That's right, so we have to build our base, organize cadres cell by cell, undermine the power structure. There are millions of white men waiting for the call. I say we just kill every cocksucking kike that gets in our way. Now, k.o.a.'s Allen berg. It's a zionist conspiracy. Here we go again. It's always been that way. Who do you think financed the world between the states? The rothschilds? That's right. And why, pray tell, would they do that? Because the Jews wanted to undermine slavery in america and let the niggers loose on this great country. I thought you just said Jews were the main slave profiteers. Well, of course. Even the niggers know that. Even farrakhan agrees with US on that. So, if they were such big slavers, why would they destroy their own trade. Doesn't make sense. No, Mr. Berg, you know why. I just told you... it's some conspiracy? Pretty complicated, big fella? Know what you are? You're a moron. Probably can't even get it up with your white trash wife. Listen, you big-nosed Jew boy, your days are numbered. Round-trip ticket. This will cover your expense. Thank you. Be careful, Jean. The lord is with US, Bob. You're supposed to kill, not tickle. Not much of a shot, I guess. I guess not. Charlie! Easy. What's going on, Bob? Tom's a good man. He's got potential. Potential? For what? Hey, Walter. You recover from that pie yet? Yeah, I guess. Hey... What's this doing here? Well, Richard said I ought to read that, said it's essential. Yeah? But I tell you something, Tom, this damn book is boring. I wouldn't know. I haven't read six books in my life. Richard, that kid, he's read everything. You know something? All these guns make me nervous. What you got to be nervous about? You ain't getting shot at. Yeah, I know. I know. Tell me something. You think you could do it? Do what? Kill somebody. Well, don't worry. I don't think I could, either. Well, amigos... What do you feel like seeing? Hey. Are you a member? Yeah. And your name? Jose. Shit. Give me all the fucking money. You like watching niggers fuck white woman? You like that? I... please don't hurt me. We're not going to hurt you, but we are going to be back, and I don't want to see any more of this race mixing you understand? You understand?! Buenas noches, señor. Adios. Yes! Yeah. Ooh! Yes! Whoo! You're it! Basically the way like it, you know? Like mama's. Tom, could I have a word with you, honey? Sure. What's up? Well, when are we leaving? Soon. Tomorrow, next day, next week? What's your rush? You don't like it here? Yeah, but we have a home. Th-this is... Money for you. Buy stuff. I'm afraid all it's gonna buy is trouble. What are you talking? What's going on, Tom? What are you guys doing? It's not for you to know. It's all right. Relax, okay? Come on, let's eat. I'm not hungry. You don't want any more? Aw, put that down, honey. Have a little pride in yourself. Please. The stew was real good, Debbie. Thanks. How do you stay so skinny? I'm just born this way, I guess. Just look at food, and... No, you're fine. No, I'm too fat. It's like Bob says. It's just... it's not right for a white Christian woman. Filth! I will not have this filth in my home! Just calm down, dad, all right? Calling my government, what does it say here, "jackbooted storm troopers"! Is that what you think? You're not looking at the whole picture, okay? I'm asking you a simple question! Do you think the American government is a bunch of Nazis? Sure getting that way. You... you dare! I fought those Nazi bastards in the war! You think just 'cause you took some steel in that leg of yours, you know everything, right? Know a damn sight more than you! Look at you! Drop out of school, enlist, and get drummed down! They were supposed to teach me a trade! All I got was shit duty. Poor Tom! Niggers running the military from top to bottom. Decent white man can't get a fair shake. Army I fought in, black man took a bullet same as a white man did. You were shooting at the wrong people, dad! What was that? You heard me. You were killing good Aryan men. White christians. I'm glad your mother's dead, you hear me? So she doesn't have to see this. I think we should go. Don't come back, Tom. You're not welcome under this roof. Dad... You hold with what your husband's saying? We're going through some hard times. Let's go. Don't you ever take his side against me, you understand? I wasn't taking a side. I was just... Just what? Telling the truth. You don't know the truth. You may think you do, but you're don't, all right? You think what, I'm going through some, some sort of new phase or something? Like I got some new damn hobby! Shh! You'll wake Diane. Now you're telling me how to be a father? I don't want to fight. I love my country, Susan. I do. It's good to have you back, buddy. How's your family? Good. Real good. Well, that's what counts. We all should have at least several wives, and that way, we could have more and more babies. It's the only way to ensure our future. Would you look at that. God! I could kill people who do things like this. Bob, why couldn't we, talk on the phone? Too dangerous. Is there a problem with the recruiting? No, no, nothing like that. Maxim says you did a good job. Problem is, Tom... Everywhere you look, there's filth. There's filth on the ground, there's filth in the schools, on TV, in our government. All I want is for our children to grow up free. Free of this filth. That's what you want, isn't it? You know I do. I know. What's that for? It's for you. I don't need that. Yes, you do. Every white man's got to be armed. Listen, Bob, there's... Certain things I just won't do. You're going to have to understand that. Well, you'd protect yourself and your family? Will you do that? When the government falls and chaos sets in, who's going to build the future? Who's going to be left standing? Good trip? Lovely country in Colorado, just lovely. Gets home same time every night? Pretty much. Never really off by more than ten minutes. Nine, nine-ten. Sometimes he stops for groceries. Just TV dinners, really. Doesn't eat properly. Smokes. Drinks too much coffee. Very unhealthy lifestyle. The street well lit? Pretty much, but where he parks his car, here? Here it's dark. You see, it's all the way at the back of the carport. Just one little light bulb there. Anybody else come home the same time he does? You did a fine job. Lord. It was hardly an effort. You will do it, won't you? I promise. With a cherry on top? With a whole lot of cherries on top. Well. Godspeed, boys. Thanks, Jean. God bless. Here it begins. Get a job? I worked five years in a row when I was in the joint. If I don't never work no more in life, I'm straight with work. Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Got a guest. Spreading the word? Always, brother. How you doing? Good. Good to see you. You... You let that stuff in your home? What are you, what are you talking about? Well, Diane's getting her little brain laundered. It's just a baby. Not even watching. It is time to move on, brother. Now, look, we value you and your family. I mean, we care about you, and we need you to help US grow. Need some time. Big things are happening, Tom, I mean, big things. Here on business or personal? Business. That's right, a fantasy. Did you know that at the nuremberg trials they didn't put one Jew on the stand to testify about the camps? Really? Just made up? That's right. It's the greatest hoax of the 21st century. See, that way, the Jews get all the sympathy. How do you think they go that Israel going? And Auschwitz was a what, a resort hotel? A work camp, smart boy, work, that's all! The Jews died from their own filthy diseases. It's a documented fact, and you want to know why? I challenge anybody out there, any of you imbeciles to prove to me that the holocaust never happened. It never happened! Hi. I'm surprised he lived in such a sleazy neighborhood. Is that what you want, Tom? I don't know. It's tempting. Sure nice up there, isn't it? Real nice country. Yeah, I guess. What? What is it? I know what we have here isn't all that much, but it's our home. Up there, it's like... So isolated. Well, you know, maybe that's exactly what we need, a little isolation. Be with our own kind. Is that what they are? What are you talking? Tom, I'm your wife and I love you, but, please, let's think about this. Think real hard. This just in. Late-breaking news. A shocking murder stunned Denver, Colorado. Controversial Denver talk show host Alan berg was gunned down in his garage. Neighbors claimed to have seen nothing unusual. An outspoken critic of the kkk and other white supremacist groups was often the target of death threats. So far, Denver police have no leads. Jesus! I got a question for you. I need the truth. Sure. Bob says we all need the truth. Yeah. Alan berg was killed last night. You know anything about it? Yeah. I know the yid was begging for it. Who did him, you know? Did we have anything to do with it? Would it bother you if we did? Look... I believe in the movement, you know, but there's just some things where, I draw the line, you know? You're a good man, Tom. We want you with US. So, we did this, or what? No! No, we didn't do this. You're sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Hey, I swear. As god as my witness. Jean. Bob. You should've been there. I was, in spirit. Is zillah home? She's waiting on you. Do I have your blessing? It is god's will. I told you big things were happening. Whose is this? Yours, mine, the order's. Bob said you got a lot of bills to make, you're behind on the rent and such, so we all want you to have it. Yeah, I know, but... Bob says we all need to stick together. So, you pay your bills, get out from under, and you come on up to metaline falls. This is a lot of money. In a manner of speaking. It's... It's funny money. Funny money? It's counterfeit. Tom, how's it going? Not bad, Mike. How you been? What can I do for you? Pack of smokes. You don't smoke. They're for a friend. I got a friend in town. What brand? You don't know his brand? Yeah, no filters. He smokes those no filters. Here. For you. So... how's Susan, the baby? Good, good. Thanks for asking. Any luck? Work-wise, I mean? Nothing yet. Still working on it. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. Tom? Take care. That wasn't so hard, now, was it? He's a good man. Been going to this place since I was a kid. Yeah, well, like I said, brother, it's time to move on. Here you go. No, no, no. That's yours. We take care of our own. Hey, it's not like... He could get in trouble or anything, right? Of course not! He just spends it. Listen, the whole federal reserve system is a racket. It's just wall street Jews making each other rich. Passing out money is just part of the struggle. I guess so. So, where to next? Right up here. Cool. Almost $1,000 there. Where did you get it, Tom? Where would you? Bob mathews. They're our friends, Susan. But where do they get the money? Tom, is there something you're not telling me? Just take the money, all right? I don't want to just take the money. Gotta pay the bills, don't we? This money, did you have to do anything for it? Do? Anything illegal? Did you?! No. Swear it. Yeah. I swear. This chicken pot pie is real good, Tom, you're gonna like it. Hey, man, good to have you back. How you doing, Walter? Real good, real good. You know, there's some big things happening. What was that all about? Nothing. He talks too much. Come on, it's only talk. He's a security risk. What are you saying? I'm saying he's an informer and he's mouthing off to the feds. That's crazy! I've been watching him! That's my job, right, Bob? I'm head of security? You are, yes, you are. Yes, and I'm telling you that Walter west is a traitor. I guarantee it. Walter's my friend. This is no time for sentimentality. Come on, Richard, where is it? You'll see. Hey... Yah! Do it. Do it! Do it! Why? Do it! Do it! Do it, you pussy, do it! Do it! Do it! Tom, when are you coming home? Soon. Yeah, but when? Tomorrow. Day after. Is there anything wrong? Tom? You were on the phone? Yeah. Susan. Is she ready to move up here? Listen, Bob, I... Jesus. All you have to do is spend it. Bob, where's Walter? He's gone. Gone? Executed. Why? He was a traitor. That's not possible. He was selling US all out. He got me in the movement. He introduced US, you and me! I just can't believe he was a traitor. It's true. We all would've ended up in jail. Now, there's $5,000 in there. Get Susan and little Diane something special, some new clothes, jewelry. And get 'em on up here to our new little Eden. Tom! I'll walk you to the truck. All packed and ready? Yeah. Hey, Tom. There's talk. About what? About the level of your commitment. You gonna kill me, too, Bob? If you turn renegade. Like Walter. But you wouldn't do that, would you? No. That's what I told the others. F.b.i. This call is being recorded. Yeah, listen. A man was killed a few days ago. His name is Walter west. He was murdered. Your name, please? No, no, I can't give my name. They buried his body in the woods, all right? Hold while I transfer your call. No, I can't hold, all right? What are you doing here? You're going to miss your flight. Seven people were wounded in the blast. Fortunately, no one was killed. In Seattle today, over $2 million was stolen from an armored car in the northgate shopping mall. So far, the police have no leads. Thank you, lord, for giving me the strength to smite thine enemies. Bob mathews was ready to begin what he called the second American revolution. He wanted terror to strike the heartland, and all this was just a prelude to a bloody uprising, a war of extermination against the blacks and Jews, against anyone who didn't agree with Bob mathews. Is that the sofa for Martinez? Yeah, ma'am. There's just a few flights to go up. Are you sure we can afford this? Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. Sign here, ma'am. Thanks. Thanks. Ever since you got back, you're like... Susan, I don't want to talk about it, all right? Well, what happened up there? Don't ask. I have to ask, Tom! I'm your wife. Susan, stop, okay? I said don't ask me about it anymore. You understand? Hello? Hey, Susan, it's Bob! Is Tom there? Sure. It's Bob. Hey. Hey, pal, how you doing? Did you catch the news? Some. That Robert in Seattle? Yeah. That was something? Listen, Bob, I... I gotta go. I can't talk right now, all right? Anything wrong? No, no, just, you know... Things. If there's anything wrong, you know we're here for you, don't you? Yeah, I-I know, I know. We care about you, Tom. Yes, you do. Okay, listen, I gotta run, all right, Bob? All right, then. I'll see you, buddy. Okay. Are you going to tell me what's going on, Tom? You don't understand, Susan. This is bad. Real bad. The police. No. Tom, listen to me. You don't understand. I go to the cops, I could be an accessory. There's no other way. They'll kill me. Your friends? The money... What about it? That money! We have to get rid of it. We have a drop. I'm scared. Scared. I'm sorry, baby. Real sorry. Tom Martinez, open the door. This is the f.B.I. Tom? Hands on the table! Special agent piercy. Are you Tom Martinez? Yeah. I have a warrant for your arrest, issued and duly signed by federal judge Martin Kelvin. Don't do this in front of my family. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law. Tom! We just want to know who's doing the press work. Who else is involved? Look, you play with US, we'll cut you a deal. I can't. Why? Just can't. Look, this is getting repetitious. Believe it or not, I'm a good cop. You people. You want me to die? No. Tom... Let's lose the melodrama. I won't talk. Your wife seems like a decent woman. I told you. She's got nothing to do with this. But will she wait for you? Wait? Counterfeiting, 15 years. Susan would wait 50 years for me. Ha! Men. Your daughter, Diane... She'll be a big girl by the time you get out, a stranger. Think how proud she'll be of her daddy. Fifteen years. That's 108 months, 5,475 days. We have federal and state charges against you. I promise you will serve a straight sentence. No early release, no parole. You will do nothing but time. I never wanted anyone to get hurt. I just wanted a better life for my family, that's all. What are you saying? That I'm scared of going to jail, scared of everything you're saying... But I've even more scared I turned into something I... Never wanted to be. What's that, Tom? A criminal? No. Something much worse. I... Know things. It's a lot more than just counterfeiting. Yahweh, bless this day and these men who fight for their freedom. Amen. Amen. Out of the vehicle! Out! Down on the ground. Down on the ground! Just a second! What the hell's going on? Keep moving. Keep moving. Go! Go! Go! Go! What's this? Three point six million? That's real? And the gun? Registered to, get this, Robert mathews, metaline falls, Washington. Hello? Hey, Susan! It's me, Bob! How you doing? Fine. Hi, Bob. Listen, how's that precious little girl of yours? Well, she's really growing. Aw, I'll be she is. Hey, is Tom there? Yeah, he's right here. Bob. Well, hey, buddy, how you doing? We miss you up here. Yeah? I want to talk to you. We need to plan. We need to talk long-range strategy. I can come to you, no problem. No, no. Not here, Bob. That's no good. Someplace else. You'll come up here, then? Yeah, yeah. All right, all right, that'll work. Great, great. Hey! Hey, listen, I got great news. We're gonna have a baby. Really? I didn't know Debbie was pregnant. No, no, she's not. Debbie's barren. No, it's zillah! What are you talking about? Jean's daughter, zillah. Bob, she's just a kid. No... she's my concubine, and we're having it at home, natural, just the way the good lord intended. Congratulations. Well, thanks. All right, then. I'll see you. Right. Where is he? Where is Bob mathews? In the beginning, god created the heavens and the earth, and the earth was without form. He got away? And I'm supposed to trust you people? You're gonna protect my family? Tom... what do you think, you think Bob mathews is stupid? He's going to know I turned informer! Maybe not. Maybe not? Who else? The gun. You're forgetting about the gun that mathews left at the brinks job. He still trusts you. You want to use me as bait, don't you? We had a deal. I already kept my end of the deal. I acknowledge that. Now I need you to go the extra mile. Are you going to be all right? Gotta have faith, right? Everything's going to be okay, you hear me? Okay. Where are you taking US? Someplace safe. See you in a few days. I love you. Love you too. Tom! Hey. Car's right here. Hey, buddy, how you doing? I thought we were meeting Bob here. Yeah, we're gonna go there now. Jump in. This isn't right. You think his cover's blown? What the hell's that about? You tell me, Tom. That you don't trust me, for chrissake? Why are we stopping? 'Cause if that car turns down this road, one of US is a renegade, and it ain't me. What are you doing? We can't lose Martinez. If we show, Tom's dead. You don't know that for sure. No hard feelings, right? No hard feelings. Well, it's good to see you, buddy. Bob. What's wrong? The airport. What was that all about? Well, can't be too careful. Yeah, well... I don't like being threatened. Of course not. Sit down. Have the feds paid you a visit? No. Tell me if they had. I need the whole picture. They haven't. 'Cause if they do, they'll try and turn you, make you an informant. You know I wouldn't do that. Nothing worse than a turncoat. Well. Meet US in room 304 in ten minutes. Smile. You're with friends. Yeah. Talk to me. Ten minutes, room 304. Okay, just stay in your room. Don't come out. Elizabeth... How'd you know not to come down that road? I didn't. Bob? Bob. Lay back. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be used against you. Slut! You white whore, your nigger fucker. I'll remember your face, bitch. Freeze! Aah! Fuck! The order had a safe house on whidbey island where Bob hoped to reorganize his uprising. Bob? Yeah? Bob, listen. We need to talk now. Okay. This house is in a bad spot. It can't be defended, Bob. There's no line of retreat, there's nowhere to run. The fed will stake out a perimeter and put gunships out on the water. We're sitting ducks. We hereby declare ourselves to be a free and sovereign people. We claim a territorial imperative... Bob! Which consists of the entire continent of North America. North of Mexico. This is nuts. This is war, for blood, soil, honor, for the future of our children, and for our king Jesus Christ we commit ourselves to battle. To death. I don't want to die. It's suicide. The best we can do is become martyrs for our cause. If we die, the future will be ours. Bob, come with US. That's Martin driving. The other guy is Parker. Mathews? Still inside, I guess. Take him. Get out of the vehicle with your hands up! Get out of the car! Move! Get on the ground. Get down. Tell me something. When you killed Walter, how'd you feel? Walter who? Bob. My very own Judas. It's all over, Bob. No, it's just beginning. No, you should give up. Never. I'm not like the others. There's about a thousand feds out here. What are you doing to do? Are you going to fight them all? My time has come. Your treachery has brought me to my destiny. Is that woman there? Special agent piercy, Mr. Mathews. You have five minutes to surrender. As for the traitor, Tom Martinez, we will eventually find him. If it takes ten years and we have to travel to the far ends of the earth, we will find him. And true to our oath, when we do find him we will remove his head from his body. What the fuck? You think mathews did himself? No way. It's Turner. What? The book they all read, the Turner diaries. They had the main character surrounded by a bunch of feds just like this. So, does he kill himself? Fights. Goes out in a Blaze of glory. You're gonna make a martyr out of him, you know. It's not my concern, Tom. Fire. Come on! Come on! The Aryan brotherhood put out a contract on Tom, and the f.B.I. Carried it out, separating Tom's head from his body, just as Bob mathews had promised. Take off his shoe. I'll get it. All right, let's try that. We assumed new identities and moved to a place where no one could find US. Tom was back to being what he called a nobody, but he was okay with that. He realized that being with US, his family, that's what counted. As for me, I don't think about knights in shining armor anymore. I don't dream about that Princess. What I do dream about is Diane, that now she'll have the chance to grow up good and decent, and that's all that I could ever ask.
