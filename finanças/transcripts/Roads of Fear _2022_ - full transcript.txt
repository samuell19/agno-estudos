But I didn't choose him on your father... you did it. Good evening. I'm sorry we popped in country in your own home. There is a dispute which we must resolve. It's about my family's reputation and my son's education. What dispute can we have with you? We do not even know each other! Wait, we can discuss this! I will do it! My son will never do that again! Of this I am absolutely certain. Do you like action movies? You know, that kind of cinema where the main character makes extraordinary deeds and in the end saves the world? Yes sir. Who is your favourite actor in movies like this? Bruce Willis... He's probably fearless. A bit like you at school, if everything i've heard is true. Is it him you're afraid of? Get up. Get up, I said! Elon, smash his rat snout. Or I will do it to his parents. You understand?! Next! Do not stop! That's some laugh! All right, Elon, you give, you give! All right! Beat him for so long until it turns to pulp! It's a joke, don't stop! Next! Next! Hey, what are you doing? are you crazy? It's 3 am. It's not my fault that I am in top form. And you?

I need to talk to Sauveur. Tell him it's about Albanians. Well, tell me, and I will I will pass the message. Can I still send an SMS? Hi! If you see Domizio, tell him that I want my gun back. What a dick. No, I am joking. It's cool. One loser wants to talk to you. my son... How are you, angel? Fine mom. He needs to rest. It'll be better in a few hours. Antone, take him to his room. Thank you, Julia. Come on. There is no stronger bond among people than family. Thank you. Your brother is sick. steps. Your stepbrother does bipolar. Drugs and electroshock they won't change anything. If there are no attacks it suffers from depression. You're just wasting your time. You know dad... It's not helping people is a waste of time but hatred and contempt. How are you doing? Everything's all right. And with you? Very good. We had a baptism today your niece, Salvina. Your sister would be happy if you came to a family party. Kiss her for me, dad. Stay a while, please. I have to go. Next time, I promise. Please. I'll leave it here. If you need something feel free to. I'll be around. What do you do to not be afraid? What? What do you do to not be afraid? I'm changing the channel. When fear nestles in my mind I replace these bloody and evil thoughts positive images. Here's the whole secret. This is some bullshit. I am suffering from some... a genetic condition. I have dry skin. I have to apply cream all the time. It's not doing well either. It's a very rare disease. There are about a hundred of us all over the world. And what does that have to do with fear? Namely, it has such that except for skin problems I have some kind of calcification in the brain. Every part of the brain controls one of the things: hearing, smell, and so on. In my case, fear is dysfunctional. That's some bullshit too. None of these things! So you're not afraid of anything? Correct. I don't even have a clue what is the feeling. We're completely different, aren't we? Different is not a problem. I will say more. It's the only way out. Any new ones? Student internships. I have little time. What do you want? We arrested a young dealer Albanian. Some roach, he had little money. But it belongs to the grid that starts roam your territory. And? It'll be out in 24 hours. I have his photo and calendar. What did he say? I don't know. I don't use sign language. And what did he say? I don't know, I don't speak Serbian. O, how do you communicate? What is he so fussy about? how's the smell in your pants? Looks like a canary! All right. Please let us know and if Albaniec will talk, we'll get back to talking. It would be nice if retrieved my service weapon. There is a chance? Stop! stop! Will you tell me why he's here? And why did you not follow him? Some dudes have arrived pick him up from under the dogs. Maybe they were planning an execution. Besides, the Serb had an appointment. Appointment? Are you making eggs? I hope, that there were no witnesses? Great. Do you know who I am? My name is Antone Matera. Represents Mr. Sauveur Coretti. The man you make... Big trouble. I think you've already heard about Mr Coretti. True? Hey, hey, hey! Focus! What do you want?! What do I want! I want to prevent a tragedy. I want to find your nest cockroaches and exterminate them. It will be a message for your homies. Here's what I want. That's how it's done! You obviously don't need training. Pretty good. You shoot well. I think you killed the guy. Yours is still moving! Now he's dead. He doesn't say anything. Shooting at the enemy at close range it's something completely different. More than accuracy and speed self-control matters. A moment's hesitation and you bite the ground. I'm ready for a baptism of fire. Whenever you want. If you put iron in the fire it changes color and at some point fire penetrates metal. With increasing temperature the iron will whiten. It will become delicate. That's when you fit in him any shape. Do you want the baptism of fire? I'll show you the fires of hell. Then we'll see how much is it really worth. Purely. To keep possiton. Nobody goes out or comes in. I understood. No, no, wait! Elon, what are you doing? Enough death for today! Are you ready to die for these people? I don't know! How ready are you follow these people? I do not know I do not know! And you would be ready to die for your family? And don't tell me you don't know! Yes! What are you doing? Nothing... This is how I browse. do you watch porn? Where, I'm doing research. Looking for something special? Haven't we done this before? I do not recall. Not even an hour has passed. Seriously, I don't remember anything. Maybe I have a problem on a neurological basis? I don't think so. I have a problem with my head. and you... you're just a nympho. A guy with bipolar disorder and a nymphomaniac. What a duo! What the fuck are you for one? Santa Claus! Santa Claus. Listen, motherfucker. I can't stand arrogance. So I ask again. And if you don't change your attitude, I'll break your face, understand?! Take it easy, Franck. I'm here on business! Do we know each other? I know you. Ah yes? And that's pretty good. Get undressed! What?! Take off your shirt, pants, All! moves! Sorry, we are fully booked. All tables occupied. A big family party! Okay, who the hell are you? My name is Victor Dalmasso. I'm a retired cop. speak. Do not stop. A few years ago we investigated... Investigation? Boxers too. What? I don't have wires in my pants! That's not the point. I want to see your balls. O! Yeah... Who were you following? Anton Matera. And what have you established? Anthony... ...fucked Sauveur's wife! With Serena? No eggs! I have photos, videos... It could make a whole series out of it! And you've probably got it all covered in some well-hidden USB? I have everything on my phone. you're kidding! Could you provide your PIN? You have something to tell me? I'm going to find a way to atone for my mistake. I had no choice! A stain on honor cannot be repaid. They can only be forgiven or washed away with blood. Please forgive me! I beg! It's not a punishment, my friend. It's reparation. We need to get closer. talk more. And fuck. I have my needs... Need a chat? Of course! What would you like to talk to me about? Well, for example, how was your day? I went shopping with Domizio. I think I spent about 5,000 euros. That's great! I'll try more tomorrow. I'm trying to hit 10,000! How has it been for you? All right. I killed 10 people. I'll try more tomorrow. Can I hit a hundred? Is that all, what can we talk about? Some cliches sprinkled with sarcasm? I don't know. You do not know... Like your mentally retarded son! Never say that again about my son, right?! Never. Good evening, Serena. I'm sorry to disturb you but it's urgent. All right, Domizio. Do not worry about me. Come closer. Increase your security measures. Inform everyone. All right. I'll take care of it. Will you tell me what's going on? The Albanians want to settle the score. You are afraid of? What are you talking about? I don't know. You seem scared Honey. Me scared? What nonsense is this?! I'm gonna fuck you today. You understand? No headache, no fatigue and some ovarian problems! Take some vitamins, damn it! - Elon, what are you doing?! - Stop! Leave me! Get out of there! You scared me! Okay, just let me go. Please come down. I wasn't going to jump. Everything is OK. What were you doing? So... I have read such an article about a woman who never experienced fear because her body is calcified. Amygdala is responsible for fear in the brain. It's a little... center of fear. It warns you from danger. He is here. In short, this woman was never afraid. Because of this disease her amygdala is not working. He's like a Viking. If he doesn't feel threatened, it has no survival instinct? See that little shelf? It probably takes up the same amount of space what's your foot now, would you agree? You keep your balance you have no doubts. But if you stepped on that ledge... You could lose your balance. Fear would create danger, wouldn't it? I'd rather be afraid of her she didn't go in, so no problem. But if you had to step on it...? Then I would have to overcome my fear. Yes, but you wouldn't be in full shape. Do I understand correctly that you want to get rid of your amygdala? Correct. Imagine the doctor's face. "Hello, I'd like to remove the amygdala!" "Not the tonsil, but it's something from the brain!" I love when you smile. I know I would be considered weird... That I should be ashamed... But I'm only happy with you! I'm not ashamed of it either But... We have to keep it a secret. And lie to everyone. We could go far away. Just you and me. Nobody would know that we are siblings. We could live like a normal couple! Well, maybe. normal married life, if you keep on lying... And be careful with everything you say. Are you ready for it? Elon, I don't want to break up. I can not imagine my life without you. I don't like it either. Well, let's eat! I will sacrifice everything for you! What's going on, Domizio? I don't know. It's Franck. What do you want? I need to talk to Serena. For you, dick, she is "Mrs. Coretti". And, like others, you have to make an appointment first! You know I am with good manners. It is very important. I would even say... A matter of life and death. I wouldn't do it otherwise. All right, let him talk. You see! I'm listening. can we be in private So what is it about? Hold and watch. No, no, like this. That will be better. It's an old story. How do you know Sauveur doesn't know about it? Well, Antone is still alive... How much? Enough for a decent retirement and out of radar range. How can I be sure that only you have it? I have it exclusively. Policeman's word! I doubt you have the balls are you just stupid. Is said to be, that bull testicles are an aphrodisiac. I don't know, but it's cut and the seasoning is pretty good. Let's be in touch. And by the way... I use a lot of talc down there. Against, if you wanted to fuck me. Do you have my gun? Don't kick my ass! If I had, I'd shove it up your ass! Moron. You should have warned that you will come! I just wanted to give gift to Salvina. Thank you, It's realy nice. It's no big deal. They're just rompers. are you leaving? Yes, for two days to Matteo's parents. Should have let you know earlier. We would have coffee and talk. It's been a long time since... Yes... We'll catch up. I'll call you earlier. Okay. call. you promise? Yes, I promise. Julia, we have no choice. We have to leave. Let's take as few things as possible and let's eat today. Look, there's going to be an investigation. Autopsies, examinations... You understand? Those who blew up the car they want to get us. And it won't end. What are you talking about? About Albanians. How do you feel? What have you done?! Go away! You too! Leave me alone! Bring everyone home! By force if necessary! And find me Franck. I'm sorry, but Sauveur is right. He can protect us. protect?! But we have to protect against it! I cut myself off a long time ago, and you? What are you doing? You're just thinking how to please him. You want to be like him. I will tell you something... You're not in the same league as him. You do not have balls. Come on, get down. What?! What is it about?! What do you want?! let me go! Hi. What are you doing here? You know you can't come near here. I just wanted to congratulate my daughter. Get lost! Please. Let me see her. Only 2 minutes. Please. I'll give it to her and go. I promise, I won't make trouble. Please. Hey baby! What's up? Everything's all right. All the best! What suits you? Thank you. Put it in your room. We have to get together. DO YOu meet with somebody? You weren't supposed to cause trouble. Don't come back here. Don't make me call the police. Have you fixed the toilet yet? What? Did you fix and clean up what the hell do you need! Ah, that's the point. I thought you wanted to wait a while. Wait for what?! For it to start pouring shit in the whole pub, you will break!? Alright, I'll get to it then. Make me some coffee. so? You came on business or socially? you peasant! What were you thinking?! Come on?! You think you can show up and mess up like that, loser?! That you are untouchable because you have a back?! Have you changed your mind with the dick?! Shit son of a bitch. Drop it immediately! Or I'll blow your head off! Hey hey light. Let's calm down. Where's my fucking coffee? I can't at the same time make coffee and hold shotguns! Come on. Put the gun down and go make some coffee. Fuck you broke my nose! did you deflate? Can we talk now? Let's sit down. One more for my friend! Why are you so concerned about money? It's not even yours! Do you know who you are? An employee just like me! I want to say... That Sauveur... He's got a lot of money. I take my share and wrap up. I'm leaving, for amen. Come on? Have you come to kill me? Of course not. I would have been dead long ago. so? Are you still knocking with her? You should've said so from the beginning. Listen to me carefully. leave. Far. Very far. I never want to see again your vile murder. Never. I'm sorry but it's closed! Sir, closed! Whore! Cholera! Sicilian mafia! Neapolitan! Calabrian! You are no different! Same macaroons! fuck off! Where is he going? On the hunt! Hey Anton! Don't let go now! Think about my money! The Albanian is now in your debt. Deal with it. Hey, I'll tell Sauver everything! You'll be screwed! Enough of this. Do you have a cigarette? Cigarette. I do not smoke! Can you speak French? Since when? Since I fucked your mama! She also taught me how to be witty. out of the way! Good evening. I need peace. For one night? Yes. Everything's all right? I've been better. Please, room number 17. At the end of the parking lot. It's quieter there, you'll be fine. - Damn it, Anthony! - You're alone? No, I came with all the escort! And Sauveur is waiting for me in the car! Do not worry. I've come out of worse things. Some alcohol... Bandages... Everything will be okay. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. For what reason? Because of the mistakes I've made. We will not change the past. But we can choose a better future. I will take care of you. All right. Going on vacation? More like early retirement. Why? Do I owe you something? I do not know, you tell me. What do you want? Albanian knowledge? I do not know anything. My restaurant no longer exists. I do not have cash. I am no longer needed by you. So yeah, I'm leaving. Why the fuck did you do that?! In business indeed you are useless to me. But... I heard, that you made a deal with Anton. I would like to know, what it was about. You won't like it. He's here. All right. Could you stop?! Shut up! Everything's all right? did you sleep well? Stop this circus! And play godfather! I have great respect for you. I prefer to end it here. I won't let you this time. What have you done?! When you were little you said... That you didn't choose your father! That it was me who made that choice! Ironically, now you chose your father! Unbelievable. I don't believe. O! This Mongol is not my son! And this dude just took a shot your father! Come on, let's finish this! Come on! Oh yeah, we'll finish this. Once and for all. What do you do? Real shame. I was starting to like you. Really. I'm doing you a favor. Believe me. Give my regards to your father. What are you doing?! What? Give me a fucking gun! Fuck, I don't believe it. move aside. Once again. Once again. Once again! Controversy continues to grow around release Saveur Coretti, a former Mafia boss. The Supreme Court found that the evidence gathered are insufficient to find him guilty. Regardless of the circumstances, he added stick to the letter of the law. It's hard for some accept the acquittal accused man for the murder of over 30 people. I've never had any contact with any criminal organization. I do not know anyone, who would be part of it. I do not understand the allegations made. Mr Coretti, your son Elon, who was supposed to testify disappeared. Do you know where he is? As you know, my son is suffering for bipolar affective disorder. He often has crises and suddenly disappears. I don't have the slightest idea where could it be. Sauveur! Thought you'd come in here like some kind superhero and you will catch me!? dung! Come on! You have the last bullet left! This time you will definitely hit! come on! MY TEAM Distributed by: Sonovision Translation: Aaron Welman
