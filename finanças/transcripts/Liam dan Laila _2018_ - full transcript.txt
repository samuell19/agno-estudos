"The 100 A Ranking of The Most Influential Persons in History" - Where's Emily? - She's inside. Thanks. There are two boxes here. There are more in the truck. But I usually take this many. - Do you understand? - Yes. Okay. All right, then. See you, Thomas. I'll be missing Rouen a lot. - How long will you go? - Thirty days. - Thirty days? - Yes. Actually, I wanna stay a bit longer. But my visa only lasts for 30 days. Don't worry, though. While I'm gone, my brother will make sure the meat supply... ... from our farm will cover all the supermarkets in here. Okay. Got it. - This is for you, Liam. - Okay. - Thank you, Emily. - Have a good trip. - I will, thank you. See you. - See you. "Liam And Laila" Peace be upon you, Sister. And be upon you, peace. Mil, Laila's future husband has arrived. Praise be to God. That guy from Makassar, right? That's the thing. He's not from Makasar, but he's from France. France? Stop with the joke, Sis. What are they doing? They're protecting me. Do they think I'm going to grab you and throw you to that lion cage? Are you talking about us? Are you planning on some schemes? I might as well throw him into that lion cage. "Bukittinggi, Indonesia" Hi. I'm Liam. Alexandre William. Jamil. Please. So, where do you live? My family owns a cow farm in France... ... and we supply meat to some supermarkets. Do you have any document that you want to show me? Yeah. Okay, here it is, sir. You speak Indonesian fluently. Yes, I've been learning Indonesian since I met Laila online. But not Minangkabau language, yet. I have two agendas. First, I'd like to convert to Islam here. Secondly, we'd like to marry soon. Get married? - With Laila? - Yes. You don't play with religion. Yes, I know. I knew Laila from Facebook three years ago. Back then, I started learning about Islam. I wasn't looking for a soulmate. Many crimes start from social media. That's not me, Mr Jamil. Now, please help me to become a Muslim... ...and help us get married. Not that easy, young man. Please, sir. I have prepared all the documents. There's a certificate of good conduct... ... a certificate stating that I'm single. And you can check about me online. But one thing for sure, sir... ... my visa here only lasts for 30 days. As a Muslim... ... I'm obligated to help you convert to Islam. But when it comes to marriage... ... it's not something to be taken lightly in our country. I have to discuss it with my family. And then I'll let you know. "Twenty-nine days to deportation" It's impossible for Laila to marry a man that doesn't share her belief. But he's been learning about Islam and plans to convert. He learns Islam to look for weaknesses of Islam... ... so he could be accepted in Muslim community. After he marries our niece, he'll take her far away. Is that what you really want? You got your degrees. You work as civil servants. But you're not thinking through. Soon, glasses and plates will be flying outside that gadang house. Ros is really happy to see people fighting. Hey... ... tomorrow, we'll find out who's going to get divorced... ... or fighting over some inheritance, or maybe disapproved marriage. Oh my God. Mom! I don't wanna see him setting his foot here. Neither to your houses. If I've got the news that he comes to your houses... ... you're not my brothers anymore. Jamil, do you understand? Yes, eldest sister. Don't let it bother you too much, Pian. I'm glad that you care about your sister. "It's confirmed, Honey." "Mom told me, if you don't propose after Eid," "I'll marry Ori. He's fat but he cares about me." So, do me a favor. Help me get Laila and that guy married. If that Westerner is a good person... ... everything will be easy. If not... ... he's going to retreat by himself. We'll see... ... how serious he is. What do you think? Thank you very much. - I'm sorry to have troubled you. - That's okay. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. But I'll be in Bandung for the next ten days, Mr Jamil. - Thank you very much, Mr Jamal. - You're welcome, Mr Jamil. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. "Twenty-five days to deportation" "What's going on?" "What's going on?" "No word from your uncle" Hello. Hey, it's me, Laila. Really? Do you like it? This one is all black, but there's more. The red one is also lovely. Which one would you like? The black one. I'm going to see the elder, Aunty. Peace be upon you, Elder. What is it? May I ask you a question? Did someone from this village... ... ever marry a foreign man? There was one, but it was a long time ago. Her name is Nurhaida. She married her lecturer from Egypt. So, it was allowed, Elder? Sure, it's allowed. But we need to know about the person for sure. What his religion is. More importantly, he have to be able to follow the tradition here. And which tribe he will join later. Even a bullock is selected carefully when it's going to be mated with a cow. Let alone human. Mom! Boy! You surprised me. Where have you been? I was with him. Hi, Pian. Hurry up and propose to Ibet. You don't want some guy gets to her first. Could I have a half glass of coffee? I've got a lot of business to take care of tomorrow. What business? My coffee, please. Hey, Pian. Remind your sister Laila that she's 31 already. Don't be too picky, she's not getting any younger. I was proposed at the age of 18... ... by his dad. All right, don't be too nosy. Just think about it. My head. Those are my eyes. "MATRIMONIAL OFFICE" "Twenty days to deportation" All the requirements are complete. See you on the wedding day. - Praise be to God. Thanks, Ma'am. - You're welcome. Ma'am, I'd like to ask something. My friend wants to convert to Islam here. - Is it possible? - Of course. Praise be to God. Never postpone a good intention. I see. Over there is Mr Ridwan. And it is his job to take care of that. All right. She's absolutely right. Take your friend here. All right, sir, I'll take him here today. Thank you, Ma'am. Pian, just a second. "What are you doing in Matrimonial Office?" "With whom are you going to marry?" "Not with anyone!" "Don't lie to me. I saw your crappy old bike there." Let's go. I'm ready. That's my friend who's going to convert to Islam, sir. We can't do it here. You have to have complete documents from your country. We still can't do it. - How come? - We just can't. - Mr Ridwan. - Yes, sir. If the documents are complete, you should process it. It's too dangerous, sir. We don't know his background and why he came here. And he's so eager to convert himself just like that. If something bad happens, I won't be held responsible... ... since my name will be on his conversion certificate. I don't want to be accused of conspiring with terrorists... ... and any radical movement. Please come in. Due to the present news that keep cornering Islam... ... people here are feeling annoyed. So, I'm sure you understand why my staff acted that way. God willing, he might be able to help. Thank you very much. We really appreciate your help. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. Here, a thawb is seen as something holy. It is something the prophet wore. It's not an apparel for war. They tell it otherwise on the news. That's how the Western media see it. But to each his own. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. Thank you for having us. I'm Jamil, this is Pian... ... and he's Liam from France. Liam has been meaning to embrace Islam. And he intends to propose to my niece. How did you come to know Islam, my brother? First, there was a terrorist attack in Paris on 13 November, 2015. All news media stated... ... that an Islamic organization from the Middle East... ... was responsible for the attack. After doing some research, I found that the organization... ... did not represent Islam. In fact, on the contrary... ... there was a possibility that it was established... ... to mix up the world point of view about Islam. And it made me want to know more about Islam. Becase each year, almost 4,000 Frenchmen embrace Islam. I wonder what it is about Islam that attracts them. And then, I accidentally met Laila on Facebook. Then, we had intense discussions about Islam. Laila explained to me in details about the religion. Her explanation really made sense to me. I was drowned to her way of writing and her open mind. But she is very firm when it comes to principles. What impressed me the most was when she told me... ... about a beautiful land called Minangkabau. Islam renewed the people's way of thinking in peaceful manner. Let alone fire... ... not a single stone flew on the roof of others' believers... ... in the land. And as I went further studying Islam... ... my intention to embrace Islam... ... in this beautiful and welcoming country is growing stronger. And... ... Laila is a seed of love that grows fonder in my heart. From many articles you have read, books, and your search about Islam... ... what are the most basic and logical ideas... ... that lead you to decide to embrace Islam, brother? I believe that inanimate objects and they are made by human... ... won't be harmful or beneficial to the makers. It's obvious that they won't... - Are you being for by someone? - No. - Laila? - No, nobody. - You make this decision yourself? - Yes, I do. I'll say Shahadah in Arabic, and you repeat after me. - And then in English. - Okay. - Ash-hadu... - Ash-hadu... - ...an laa ilaaha... - ...an laa ilaaha... - ...illallah. - ...illallah. - Wa ash-hadu... - Wa ash-hadu... - ...Anna Muhammadan... - ...Anna Muhammadan... - ...rasulullah. - ...rasulullah. - I bear witness... - I bear witness... - ...that there is no god... - ...that there is no god... - ...except Allah. - ...except Allah. - And I bear witness... - And I bear witness... - ...that Muhammad... - ...that Muhammad... - ...is the messenger of Allah. - ...is the messenger of Allah. God has willed. You are a Muslim now, my brother. You can come here anytime you like to learn about Islam. Praise be to God. - Thanks, Pian. - Sure. - Peace be upon you, Liam Gallagher. - And peace be upon you, too. Hey, are you an Oasis fan? - Yes. - Yeah, good. Yes. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. Excuse me. Sorry I am late. Please. So, for this whole week... ... Pian and I have been trying to know who Liam is. And we found out his sincerity to embrace Islam. So... ... my conclusion is... ... he's very serious with our niece. He has embraced Islam, then? Praise be to God. ... he has declared the Shahadah in front of Buya Amran. Praise be to God. Older Sis, based on what Jamil said... ... I think it's appropriate for us to give blessing to Laila's marriage. Jamil maybe the smartest among us. He may have high position in his office. But in this gadang house, as the eldest sibling... ... I have the right to decide... ... before I take this notion to the village board. In my opinion... ... that's not enough basis for us to make a decision. Becase nowadays, people aren't afraid to lie under oath. Back then, when I was about to marry Haris... ... everyone was concerned because he didn't have a permanent job. You have a master degree, Laila. Haris didn't even finish high school. When Irwan proposed me... ... everyone was afraid he would take me to Melaka. And now, Liam came all the way from France... ... it still can't change Eldest Aunty Naizar's mind. Forgive me, God. So, what would be the best ground for us... ... to make a decision, Sister? Have him circumcised. Okay. I'll make sure he will do it tomorrow. "Seventeen days to deportation" - He's in. - Right. How does it feel to get circumcised at that age, Uncle? Beats me. Why do you keep asking strange questions? Just after being circumcised... ... then he's getting married. Is it really okay? Enough with your blabbering, Pian. - So, are you ready? - Not yet. I'm nervous, Uncle Jamil. Relax. Say "In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful." In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful. Dear God! "Dearest Ibet" Hello. What took you so long to pick up the phone? Did you take care my lottery ticket? Did I win? Yes, of course I'm still on it. You've been telling me that. Go and take care the lottery ticket. - Okay, I'll go there. - Just go. Hello, Laila Collection. Yes. Right. Hi, I've received your notification. Yes, you've transferred, right? Yes. Okay. All right, hope you shop again soon. Thank you so much. Bye. - Have a seat. - Hi. I'm here to check the Wow Soap Lottery Winner for this month. What is your lottery numbers? Sure. It's 3-2-0-1-2-4-3-4-3-4. Yes, that number is the winner for last month. - Not for this month? - I'm afraid not. Please give me the prize. Sorry, sir. That's last month winner. - Where's the prize? - It's no longer available. Please help me, just a little bit. - I'm going to go. - Stop hitting on that washing soap clerk. Sir. Sir. Sir. Nurse. You may go home now. But you have to complete the payment at cashier five. Yeah, okay. I'll call my relative. Thank you. "ATM" Indonesian language. Yes, I will. Praise be to God. No! Are you serious? No, come on! I told you from a week ago, and you kept on postponing. And who's fault is this? Is it my fault? My friends' fault? He ran away and didn't pay. No, I was trying to pay. I can explain. Hey, please. I was... He's running away! So, if we're talking about soft power, the art of culture... You know I've been sending those lotteries since junior high. And now I won, but you were too late to claim it! You don't care about me! You're really mean to me! Stop here, sir! What is going on? Call the police! Call the police? Why do you want to call the police? He's just been circumcised, you're accusing him a convict. You take him as some anti-corruption agency's wanted man... ... who would hide at a hospital. He's my relative. Let's settle this at the hospital. Go now! Go! What were you thinking? Go! Nowadays, our approach should be based on... "Pian The Nephew" Hello. Peace be upon you. Thanks. I'm sorry it's not as easy as you thought it would be. I'm glad it's all over. It's all right. I really appreciate the process. Here, I can see that not everything is liberal. Everything is organized and has clear boundaries. Not like us. At the age of 18, we can legally take decisions for our own life. But, you know, often families are breaking up... ... because decisions are taken at early age. Slowly. How are you holding up? I'm okay. Well... I'm glad you feel that way. Although... ... I can't help but wonder... ... why does Mr Jamil always take care of everything? Are your parents not happy with all these? No. It's not like that at all. See, the fact of marriage in Minang... ... is uniting two big families. So, part of the family member, the uncles... ... usually take care and also prepare the wedding of their nieces. But of course, it's also with the blessing of the parents. I see. So... ... what's next? Tomorrow, we'll hand in marriage requirements... ... to the Simpang Tujuh Matrimonial Office. You said you were going to wait at the parking lot. You are not allowed to be left alone just yet. Let's go grab some peanuts. Come on. It's over there. Does it hurt? How did you get away from all the people that chased you? Thanks to your brother, my hero. He came out from nowhere and saved my life. What did I do? Why is he putting the blame on me? Sister, what did he say? Everything is stated here very clearly. Sometimes, we need to give them a lesson. They think they can just get married that easily here. "Eleven days to deportation" How is it, sir? Mr Jamil, Mr Liam. - The documents are complete. - Praise be to God. Yes. But we need one other document. A letter from your embassy stating that you're still single. No, I... Excuse me. I got this, I'm sure. Yeah, it's this one. Here, you can check this. A letter issued by French Population and Civil Registration Agency. Mr Jamil, I'm really sorry. Both of us are civil servants. But it seems to me that you don't know how regulations work. It is clearly stated here, a letter from the embassy. Not from Population and Civil Registration Agency. I can't process this. - Mr Ridwan. - Yes, Mr Jamil. You, of all people, should be the one who understands this bureaucracy. One of the functions of an embassy... ... is helping their citizens to have documents.... ... so they don't have to go back to their country. So, they don't need to go back to France, Alaska... ... or any country for that matter... ... just to get a document that states he's not married. Liam, with good intention, has prepared all the documents... ... needed in our country, and he did it in his country. So, what's the use of a letter from the embassy... ... if he already got a letter from his country? Doesn't it the letter from his country has more legal standing... ... than the one from the embassy? I can't work outside regulations. And... ... the regulations give me time to have a lunch break. Thank you. What the heck? Sir. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Your phone. Two weeks ago you just came back from Jakarta... ... after receiving certificate and trophy as Indonesia's best civil servant. For the past few days... ... you have left the office at working hour... ... without informing your secretary. Abandoning meetings. Your name tag. And you used your car for personal business. If the mayor knows... ... this may taint your performance, Mr Jamil. If this happens to a regular staff, there won't be a problem. But you are a head of a department. So, it's only appropriate for you to receive this letter. God is the greatest. I only have eleven more days. What should I do? I have no money. I can't get in touch with my family. - Does Older Sis Laila know about this? - No. - What about Uncle Jamil? - I haven't told him. You need this. I have data plans, go ahead and use it for video call. - Are you serious? - I'm dead serious. Use this. Sarah, my card has been swallowed by the ATM. I can't make a claim here. Could you send me money via Western Union? I'll send it right away. I hope everything goes well and you can come back soon. All right, please send the notification to this number, okay? - Yeah, sure. - Yes. - Thank you, Sarah. - Yeah, no problem. Bye. - Was that your sister? - Right. She's pretty. Liam, hop on. That's more like it. Take your feet up. Hey, Liam! - Bye! - Liam! Come back here! Don't leave me! "Ten days to deportation" - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Are you ready? - Yes, ready. Please stretch your hands. - Frisk me. - Please. Please proceed, sir. - Hello. - Yes, please. May I help you? - May I see your identification? - Sure. - Here's your ID card. - Thank you. Thank you. - Mom. - Why isn't Pian with you? He might still be asleep. Dear God. Where is he? He didn't come home last night? Liam might take him as a hostage. Because he thinks we make it harder for him to marry you. Call the police, Laila. Don't be judgemental, mom. "Jakarta, Indonesia" French or English? English. English is fine. Okay, Mr William. I don't see any problem with your letter. Religion Affairs authority requires a letter from the embassy. Just like the law regulates in here. Yeah, but normally this letter is enough for marriage requirements. I know, that's the problem. They didn't accept it. They wanted the embassy to issue it. So, help me. I only have 10 days from now. So, you want to ask a complaint for their ignorance? That's not what I meant, but... You know, Indonesian laws. Okay, I see. Wait a moment, please. We're going to wait. - Please talk to my colleague. - Yeah. Thanks. Ma'am. Can I charge my cellphone? Pian, please. I understand you can have some difficulties... ... with the bureaucracy in this country, right? So, what can you do to make this letter legit? Let me see. Well, all I can do is to issue a letter stating that the letter you have... ... is valid. Praise be to God. - Are you Muslim? - Yes, I am. - Already for one week. - Nice. - Just a second, yeah? - Okay. Pian, seriously? So, I've printed the document for you. We must still wait for my boss for the signature. Maybe you can have your lunch first and then come back. We're here until 04:00. I was hoping to go back to Bukittinggi tonight with the last flight. Yeah, just pray. - Okay, so I'll come back at 02:00, yeah. - Yeah. Thanks. Pian, let's go. This is how Minang people do it. Wherever they are, they always eat rendang. - Just for a bit. - Don't! You stingy. - Peace be upon you, Bet. - And peace be upon you, too. What's up? - I've just finished praying. - Did I hear it right? - Yes, you did. I'm in Jakarta. - Please, don't lie. I'm doing a crossword puzzle. Who's the President of Indonesia... ... from December 27, 1949 untiil August 15, 1950? Mr Assaat. One more. Who's the actor in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham? - Amitabh Bachan. - I didn't know you are so smart. - You're really the one for me. - I am indeed. - I think that's it. Thank you. - All right, Bet. - Mr William. - Yes. I'm really sorry, there has been a demonstration and some rerouting. And my boss couldn't make it to the office today. So? I can leave the letter at my desk. You can come here again at 9 o'clock tomorrow. Tomorrow? My God, I can't wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow I will only have nine days before they deport me from this country. Please, sir, you have to find me a solution... ... so I can go back to Bukittingi tonight. I understand, but this is the best I can do. - Please come back tomorrow. - Seriously? Okay. Come on. "And with Him are the keys of the unseen."

Hope you're not spoken for." "Regards, Haris." You have a master degree. I don't want you to marry Haris who doesn't even finish high school. What is he going to feed you? Grass? I'm looking for a family leader... ... not a man with a lot of money and high position. Laila, you and Haris are not meant to be. - Mom! - No! What we heard is just not appropriate. Your niece is getting married... ... but we heard it from people gossiping, instead directly from you. You're the oldest woman in this gadang house. Why didn't you teach your niece our tradition, Naizar? So, here's our stand. Rumor has it Laila is getting married with foreign man. And we've had enough hearing about it. As for the three of us... ... invited or not, we're not going to take part. Our siblings here are smart enough and don't need our help. So, we think you can solve this problem yourself. All right, then. When problem arise, we'll find the solution. I, myself, have been reminding our siblings... ... to be very careful in facing this situation. So far, they've been taking the right way, according to tradition. I know they haven't come to you to ask for blessing yet. I hope you understand, they need to finish the bureaucracy first. But since you said you don't want to take part... ... we will deal with it ourselves. Please have the coffee. Let me know if you need more sugar. It's obvious that you don't respect us anymore! I educate my children, siblings, nieces, and nephews in this gadang house... ... to understand the importance of religion and tradition! However, Islam will be the basis on making the decisions in this house. Let's stop here. Let it be known that people here have made light of our tradition. They disrespected it. They never thought about who is going to propose... ... how will the proposal be... ... who will prepare the marriage, where will the bride be taken... ... who will eat the buffalo's head. They don't understand. It's not our business anymore. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. Haris, Burhan's son, has return to the village. It would be better if you reconsider about their old proposal. Think about it, Naizar. Wait here, Pian. I hope you're not waiting for the last flight. Even if I was, before they open, I'm already there. - Merci beaucoup. - Au revoir Okay, Pian. Let's go. - To the airport, sir. - That's right. Please step on it, sir. We're in a hurry. Hi, sir. Where are you heading? Let me drive you there. - Let's go. - No! Come with me. Let me take you there. Just talk in Minang language! One more thing. Please be patient. I'm still a little jet-lagged. And you're grabbing me left and right. - Are we in trouble? - No problem. I'll handle it. Hey, Pian, Liam! Come on! Where's your car? This is my car. I meant, this is my own car. I bought it with my own money. It's not ethical to use the facilities from the office for personal activity. Why are you taking leaves of absence? I can't keep on leaving work to help you. It'd be better for me to take leaves. May God rewards you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Why did you return so soon? - That's the thing. I've tried working in Batam. First of all, it's so far away. Secondly, after much thought and consideration... ... I think it's better for me to start a business in the village. Praise be to God, I saved some money from working in Batam. So, I come here to talk about... Mom, I have good news for Laila... - Haris. - Pian. - How have you been? - Praise be to God. - You've got back from somewhere, Pian? - I just went back from Jakarta. - Jakarta. - Yeah. - What do you do now? - I was taking care of... I took care of my property business. Property business? - That's awesome. - Praise be to God. Have you got any kids now? I'm not married yet, Pian. Maybe... ... that's the one thing I missed in this village. And I have decided to get it back. It's getting late, I'd better go. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. Laila. - Pian. - Okay, Ris. One of them... ... he keeps getting problems. And the other one... ... he comes at the wrong time. What am I going to do, Mom? "Praise be to God All documents are complete" "Pian helped me a lot" "From Haris Firmansyah" "Laila, when would be the right time for our parents to meet?" "Eight days to deportation" Here is the letter from the embassy. It looks like all documents are complete. But we need to wait for Mr Ridwan's verification. Just a moment, sir. All documents have been provided, sir. Mr Jamil, Mr Liam. Doesn't the embassy issue this letter in Indonesian? Not that I don't believe this letter. We want to minimize the suspicion that this letter isn't valid. Mr Ridwan, the embassy only issues documents in English... ... and its native language. If you do not understand... ... I can help translating this into Indonesian. Look, this letter states that the single status affidavit... ... from Civil Registry Service of Rouen City... ... on behalf of Alexandre William... ... me... ... Number CTX809 is true. See? You should understand the regulations here. This letter should be translated by a sworn translator... ... or by government institution. Forgive me, God. "English Training Center" "English Language Courses" Uncle Jamil, do you remember? - What? - He said by a sworn translator or... ... by government institution. This letter states that... ... the single status affidavit... ... from Civil Registry Service... ... of Rouen City on behalf of Alexandre William... Why didn't you put your name there? Oh, because I'm on leave. "Cultural Implementation Service" - What letter is it, sir? - I need your favor. Okay. - Here's the stamp. - Okay. - Please send my regard to everybody. - Sure. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. LAN, thank you. So, we have verified that the main document... ... and the supporting documents of Mr William from France... ... and Miss Laila from our village are complete. Praise be to God. Now, we shall decide the date of the ceremony. Where will the procession take place? In a mosque, a resident... ... or at this office? - In a mosque. - What do you think, Mr Ridwan? You're the counselor and officer of matrimonial affairs. I think... ... we can proceed, sir. - Praise be to God. - Praise be to God. Bye. Thank God your Al Fatiha recitation is quite good. Hopefully I could learn more from my wife tomorrow. Well, my future wife. So, Buya, I'm getting married tomorrow. Give me some advice. It's simple, Liam. A marriage which is conducted for the sake of God... ... shall be full of blessing and affection. There are two keys. Being grateful and patient. Be grateful in good times, stay patient during bad times. Be careful, Pian. Hurry up. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. Here with us tonight our highest elder... ... who really understands the condition of our family. Older brothers... ... older sister... ... my family and everyone here. As we all know... ... this process has not been easy. By God's blessing and His pleasure... ... all marital requirements of Liam and Laila... ... have been completed. In fact, our nephew, Pian, accompanied Liam to Jakarta... ... to really make sure that Liam... ... is a good and law-abiding citizen. So, tonight, as her uncle... ... I'd like to ask your permission Dan blessings... ... to carry out Liam and Laila wedding ceremony... ... tomorrow morning at the mosque. For the ritual... ... older Sis Naizar is handling the process. Maybe some of us... ... have never thought... ... that she's been supporting us... ... all along. Haris' parents came to make another proposal to Laila. Sometimes, what we think is the best for us... ... is not necessarily the best according to God. And what we dislike... Thank you, Eldest Aunty. Hopefully, I could come home to this gadang house. ... God might love it. - Peace be upon you. - And peace be upon you, too. There is still time to think it over. As for Liam... ... we could not underestimate all his efforts. As for Haris... ... we know very well about his ancestry and religion. God willing... ... I will marry... ... Liam. "Three days to deportation" "Our Lord, we have believed... ... so register us among the witnesses of Al Quran and the Prophethood."
