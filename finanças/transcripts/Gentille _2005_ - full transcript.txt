Good Girl That's enough. Stop following me. You've followed me from the subway. You look normal, but I don't want to have coffee. Not tomorrow, not ever. Tomorrow I'm busy. I nearly missed my stop, I hurried to get off, but I wasn't after you. But you noticed me? Sorry, no. You didn't notice me? I've some problems right now, but... I'm sorry, I didn't want to annoy you by not following you. I'm sorry. I must apologize, I'm confused. I don't know. Do you want a coffee? I'm late for an appointment. Tomorrow then? OK. Tomorrow at 6 pm? - Know the Mont Lozère? - Yes. 6pm. I'll make sure I'm free then. Goodbye. Goodbye. It's nice. You don't want to talk? Right. The smile is good. Keep smiling. Don't move. Hello. How are you? - Fine. - You didn't move to Toulouse? It was Bordeaux. No. In the end I stayed here. When I saw you, as I thought you were in Bordeaux, or rather Toulouse, I got a shock seeing you here. I understand. And I'm never in Paris, since I now live in Lyon. Are you alone? Yes. I had some spare time. Silly. I just felt like it, like wanting a pee. No. I mean, do you live alone? Oh no! I'm still with Michel. - With Bernard. - With Bernard? Yes. You said Michel. You meant Bernard. A slip of the tongue. I don't know any Bernard. Ophélie Legouénédal? I'm not Ophélie Legouénédal, I'm Fontaine. Fontaine Leglou. Fontaine Leglou? No! I don't know that name. Or maybe I sent you to some other therapist at once. So you're not the person who handles my account? My customer advisor, Jean-Philippe Loniewski? No, no. I'm Maurice Gudarzi. Doctor Maurice Gudarzi. Really? - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Can you do it fast? Shall I do a body? Isn't it a portrait? Yes, but I can do a body underneath. A small body. Like a cartoon. OK. But do it fast. Do you know me? I'm often here. Yes, maybe. Full price? I wondered if by any chance I'd left my things here yesterday? A green bag. I've no green bag. We can lend you a swimsuit if you want. But that's not very hygienic. Well, OK. It's borderline. That depends. Thanks. Do you want a cigarette? Yes, please. That one. Can I have another one? You smoke too much, Doctor. - Ouarnia! - Sonia! Yes? Sonia. Who's in the lounge? Cécile and Toufik. Talking. Toufik is better. You want to go? No. It's OK. You should do a workshop. How about pottery? You could make a little ashtray. That makes you laugh? I'm not allowed to, yet. I can go out, but no workshops. There's no workshop on narcosis days. - I had no narcosis today. - You did. Yes? Get some rest. Is the anaesthetist's name... Really... Fontaine? Fontaine Leglou. Have a rest now. Hello, Fontaine. Hello, Michel. How are you? Fine, yes. Fine. Hello, Mirette. Is it OK if I pay on Thursday? Sure. No problem. No. But this is me. Could you make some nice hot tea, please? I hope you don't ask Mirette to make tea for you. - Of course not! - I can do it. - I know how. - Yes. Who's that? Amandine. A neighbour. You don't know her? - She forgot her keys. - Oh? What? I shouldn't have? She rang the bell. What could I do? No, I don't believe you. Go away before I call the police. Amandine, this is Fontaine. Fontaine, Amandine. - Hello, Amandine. - Hello. It's very good. I'll go now. They must be back. What time is it? "Quarter to five, snakes alive." Bye, Michel. Bye, Amandine. - Amande, Amande. - OK. Bye, Amande. More tea? She's funny. Yes. But "Amandine", after all... What a name, "Amandine". It's a pretty name. Didn't a young Amandine go missing in the 80s? There were posters in all the tobacconists. Shit! It was nice when I used to smoke. She was never found. Well, now she's back. Had a bad day? No. My day starts in 2 hours, I'm on nights. All the same... Why was there a little girl here? I told you, she forgot her keys. OK, but all the same. I don't know, it's... Excuse me. Weren't you embarrassed? It's odd. What did you do? I don't know, we chatted. I was on the computer, she watched TV. You chatted to Amandine, OK. What are you getting at? What are you saying? Aren't you a bit abnormal? - You can believe it, darling. - What? That you live with a guy who loves a girl like you. No. But... It's still odd. Why were you wearing gloves? She saw them, what could I say? "I never wear gloves when with a little girl." I put one on, so what? - What are you thinking of? - Nothing. All the same, Amande! She's an odd child, isn't she? No. You're the one who's odd. They didn't realize till late. All the time it was there. It wasn't growing. At age 18, 20, when he finished his... When he'd finished. "When he'd finished" growing, they realized he had a small extra jaw. "A jaw"? A complete jaw? Yes. They did X rays. It happens, usually in the head. I didn't know that. The remains of a twin who didn't develop. Was that your brother who was here? - He seems nice. - Yes. He brought me an electric kettle for making tea. It'll be better than hot water from the tap. His wife, my sister-in-law, is a water deviner. She's an interior decorator, but she finds water too. Country dwellers hire her. - No! - They do. Smoking's allowed here. Know what I'm thinking of? Yes. I think so. Not bad. Know what I'm thinking of now? Hmm... Yes. You can't know now. I can. Oh yes! Perfectly well. You're wondering whether to ask me if sometimes, you could... Know what I mean? Oh, that? Well. No, I wasn't thinking of that. Why? Do you... Would you like me to do that? But what exactly is "that"? Oh, I see! No, no. Well... Not really, no. Why? Do you want to? Me? It's not really my thing. You know that. Yes, of course. OK. So is everything OK? Everything's fine. My lord. "My lord." We love each other, right? Apparently. Right. So I think I should marry you then. Marry me, Fontaine. Fontaine. I'm asking you in the most official way. Be my wife. Be Mrs Fontaine Michel Strogoff. Come on! Marry me. But I'm already your woman, no? So you don't want us to marry. Of course I do. I'm just surprised. I don't know, I don't know. So it's not a yes. Don't sleep, you're on nights. I forgot the outside key. There's the intercom. Were you asleep? You're always sleeping. Well... Sometimes. I'll be in my office. Nothing to report? Nothing. You've hurt yourself, Doctor. No. Wish me a good night. Goodnight, Doctor. Shit! Sorry, I'm late. Hello. You were leaving? I could have waited longer, but I saw my bus coming, so... You live on the 38 bus route? The 38 bus is good. Reliable. Yes. And you? The 75. That's trickier. Shall we have that coffee? - You don't drink? - I do. You've kept your coat. Are you cold? I'll take it off. What's your name? Jean-Pierre, right? Jean-Jacques. I knew it. You look like a Jean-Jacques. But it doesn't matter. And you? You look like... Sylvie? Fontaine. "Fontaine?" Fontaine. You wear a ring. Are you married? Yes. Don't worry. My wife knows about my affairs, she has some too. In fact, we tell each other about them. Really? Oh! But I... Well, I... I'm not used to... I never drink except with meals. But you don't have to. I'll just say, if you want to go to a hotel, we can. There are lots round here. Are you married? No. That's just it. "That's just it"? I've just received a proposal. So why are you here? I don't know. I really don't. But I can't go to a hotel. Shall we get the bill then? Will you tell your wife about me? No. There's nothing... There's nothing interesting to tell. My name, perhaps. What was it? A guy's been looking at you for ages. Do you know him? He looks a bit like a patient, but no. The patient's held in a secure clinic. Fontaine. It's Fontaine. Then why is he looking at you, Fontaine? I must look like someone he knows, but it's not me. - It's not you? - It's not me. - It's not you? - No. It's not me. Excuse me, I think I'll leave now. I wanted to tell you... I never do that. "That?" Yes, that. Or that. Or even that. Sorry. Could you give me a cigarette and a light? No. Please. No, I can't. Maybe, but... No, I said no. No! No. No, no. Please. No way. Shit! Look, I'm smoking. Careful! He'll throw it in my face. No, no. There. Bye then! Bye! Hello. Yes. What's the problem? No problem, this always happens. I repeat. Tell us the problem and we can take action. There's no problem, it happens by itself. Very well, I'll hang up. Thank you. Oh! OK. I'm not asleep. How did you do that? There are more? Actually, I did a show at Beaubourg, with a German fire-eater. And you? It's late. I buried my sister's dog. He was run over. Oh, poor thing! How awful. Yes. But you don't have a sister. No. She doesn't have a dog, if you don't have a sister. If I had one, she'd have one. And sooner or later it would have been run over. She'd have called me to help bury it in the garden. Then we'd have had one last Coke in her kitchen. We'd barely have talked. Leaving, I'd have stepped on something slippery. There'd have been lots about. I'd have come home grumpy, disgusted. I'd have told you and you'd have... hit me. No way! You're sick, you have a problem. Suddenly, you'd have looked at me. You'd have turned round. Slowly you'd have reached out to turn the light off. And you'd have kissed me. Like the first time. Shit! What? What did you say? Really? Pleased to meet you. How are you? Sorry, I forgot! How did you find me the other day? Fine? Yes. - You didn't find me gloomy? - No. You know me well, you'd notice a change. Oh yes! Sure. - You made me. - Yes. So what do you see? Something in my eyes? Do I seem absent? Not really with you? Or only by trying hard? Does what usually makes me laugh now leave me cold? Yes. It leaves you cold. Yes. But it's me saying all this. Yes, that's it. That's it, exactly. OK. And Dad? Fine. He's gone back down to 0.3. 0.3? Great. Bye now. - How! - How! - Prostate? - Prostate. Sorry, I had a patient in my office. My home is your home. - Don't start again, it's over. - My mistake. - Got it? - Yes, thanks. My mistake, then. How's your husband? - We're not married. - Same as. Is it? I don't know. Take that away, please. It attracts cockroaches. I gave you those Louboutins. Hugues. The parents of Estelle in 104 are here. Very well. - It's not what it looks like. - But I... - Tell them I'm coming. - OK. "Hugues!" You sleep with her? I wouldn't say that. Yes, you sleep with her. - Hugues. - Yes? This smells really fishy. I can explain why I have no shoes. But it would be quite difficult to do so. I'm sure it would. Careful, that chair's wonky. Yes. Like in the canteen. What canteen? The canteen. In primary school. Eating in the high school canteen. Disgusting food, rubbish chairs. Duralex glasses. They tell you your age. So! How old am I today? No? Didn't you eat in the canteen? To tell the truth, no. Or just for a week or so, when... - When what? - My mother broke her coccyx. You didn't ask to see me, Doctor...? Philippe. Philippe. You didn't ask to see me, Dr Philippe Philippe, about my mother's coccyx, my father's prostate. Or did you? - I'm not a shrink. - I know. Doctor. Go on. Philippe's my first name. My name's not Philippe Philippe. No. No. I see an ashtray. - May I smoke? - No. Unless you can't help it. I can help it, I can help it. It doesn't bother me, but... But if you couldn't have helped it, you could have. Why look at me like that? Like what? Like this. If I did that, what would you think? Go on, do it! That you love me. That you like me, at least. Yes. I'd think that you like me. More than that. That you don't know what's in my head, but you'd like to take a look there. To see what's there. "What's there"? Yes, to see what's there. In my head, in your head. I saw you yesterday. In the square, in Beaubourg. Oh! - With the... - Yes? It's me. Am I interrupting? No. We've finished. Have a seat. The fire-eater. Of course. I did eat in the university canteen. OK. But yesterday you were juggling for a crowd. I was juggling. Yes. It'll be OK. Goodbye, Philippe. Just a trick by the interns. - Who? - The interns. I thought they didn't like you? - Oh? - I don't know. You told me they found you cold and haughty. - Good looking, but bourgeois and... - "And?" And happy about it. Really? No. I don't think so, anyway. Maybe I said that because I'm paranoid. Just joking. You're not, and you didn't. OK! OK, right. So no one said I was good looking? No one. But I have something for you. Can you lend me your shoes? Scared of laddering your tights? Come on! Just to get to the car. We can't go to my parents' like this. True. And we mustn't arrive at 7.20pm. You know her. At 6pm she starts thinking we've forgotten. Who was the patient? A doctor. Right. What doctor? A patient? Right. You touch him, you call him Philippe. We use first names here. For privacy. Even between us, we never use surnames. He doesn't look ill. He is, he's being treated. What does he take? Anafranil 75, one, zero, two. Rivotril, half, half, one. Tegretol, but now he's changing to Lithium. Imovane at night. He also gets 2 or 3 ECT, narcoses, a week. Yohimbime, two, two, one for comfort. Got it? And so he's like that, calm, alert, controlled, yet also unfathomable, well dressed, unpredictable. A man... - Amen. - A man, hell! A man! Not "Amen". If it's not you, it's him. He's after you. It's nothing. Somewhere here I have proof I no longer trust you. It's somewhere. He wanted to talk. You're no shrink. But unlike you I have to handle fucking problems. Do I fuck you off when, 794,000 km away, a frozen penguin defrosts and makes the earth's crust move 2 mm, and you have to rush off to join those Eskimess bitches, your palaeoclimatologist colleagues? Eskimo. We don't say Eskimess. OK. "Eskimo." You see, I can say it. Hello. Palaeoclimatologist. Hello. I'm Cleia, I'm new. Where did you find those coats? I think it's time you went back to your rooms. You're in Dr Leglou's office and he'll be back in a minute. Actually, I'm Dr Leglou. So I'm a woman. You can call me Fontaine if you like. I'm her partner, Michel Strogoff. Excuse me. I've already heard of you, sir. We haven't heard of you, Celia. - No. - Clea, not Celia. Sorry. Clea. It's pretty, Clea. Thanks. Actually, it's Cleia. With an "i". Sorry. Cleia, then. It's pretty, Cleia. Thanks. I must go. Sorry about that. It's OK. Bye, Clea. See you soon. Cleia. Scrabble? Not tonight? Tomorrow, maybe? I hid it, because I was ashamed of wearing this corset. I didn't feel normal in it. I express myself with my body, and being trapped in a plastic thing, with bits of metal, was the opposite of what I was living and what I wanted to live. We'd queue for the canteen. I had my own technique, I stuck to the wall. Everyone used to queue. Can I help you? I came for the tray, I saw you'd eaten nothing. Not hungry? Feeling bad? What do you say when it's late, the food's cold, and instead of sitting, you want to stand and watch someone leave, someone who bowls you over, but you don't do it? When it's your 4th stay, you have electric shock treatment as nothing else works, you know you'll leave, but you don't know when, for what, or for whom, and horrifyingly, you think it's not so bad here. What's it called? It's called: "Get ready for bed, hope the night's OK." Yes. That must be it. That must be it. Shall I leave the yoghurt? Yes, please. Leave the yoghurt. What is it? 9510B. How come I know your codes and you don't know mine? Your parents, office, brother, your garage and phone. 9510B, 83A73, 2569, 1856, 1011, 20B92... No. 92B20. Why, when I propose, do you not know what to say? 2801. You know my shrink's code? When you asked me to leave your thesis on his doormat: Between seasons in the Arctic and Antarctic. "Between seasons", as if... Who's that? "Who's that?" Jack the Ripper and Sylvie Reviriego, Mum. Come from the past to haunt you. Who? - It's us. - It's us. Oh! "As if?" As if he'd be interested. Sorry, but he is interested. Sure, he's interested in you. I'm interested in you too. B7680. EA551. Darling! It's tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Not tonight? No. Tomorrow. But come in. The new hairstyle suits you. It's not new, I haven't had it cut. Well, that's good, as it suits you. Jean! Jean! It's Michel and Fontaine. Come and see her new haircut. Perfect, just like the old one. Oh! Don't worry. It's nothing. Almost gone. Well, let's... Let's have a kiss anyway. So! You were so eager to see us, you came early? Yes, that must be it. I'd have done rabbit. You'd have liked that? Yes. A lot. With fresh pasta. You'd have liked fresh pasta? - Yes, but... - You'd have preferred aubergines. I knew it. I said we should do both. I'd have done both. Tomorrow we can't. Well, I've nothing for you tonight, darlings. Unless... I can offer you a yoghurt. OK. I'd like that. I'll go. Check the expiration date, darling. Expiry. E-X-P-I... R-Y. OK! Okay! Oka! I'll go and help Philippe. Michel? Michel. Wake up, Dad, this is important. Really? He's not asleep. Just thinking. Are you sure? As he did as a baby. How do you know? As a baby. We met at the age of 16 months. Well, he was 16, I was 13 months. But I was toilet-trained before him. Mum, stop it! We don't need the details. Pass me my shoes, we need to be off. Forget the yoghurt, we'll take it. I'll lend you your father's shoes. And you help me skin the rabbit. It's cut, but it takes 2 to pull it off. No way! I won't skin anything. That's the butcher's job, take it back. Come on. I also got roast beef for tomorrow. You'd have preferred that, eh! Roast beef, tomorrow. Yes, yes. What? Nothing. I took the liberty of... You were quite right. You know, for two years, I was homeless. Angèle and I got divorced. We remarried later, but for 2 years I had nothing. I gave up everything. I didn't want anything. They called me Jeannot, or Jean-Jean. Everyone thought I was working in Costa Rica, as an engineer. But I was just nearby. Do you know Rica? Costa Rica? No. Nor do I. Of course I was just nearby. Yes. Angèle often walked past me, going to the market. She'd drop coins into my cup. Even a note, once. I had a hat. I had nails this long. And worn out blankets donated by the parish. And one day they asked me if I was a Jew. "A Jew?" Yes, yes. You know what they said? "Well done for being honest." So I took my blankets and shoes and never set foot there again. Twice I saw the boys go past. Etienne's a year younger than Michel. He'd come by with girls, each uglier than the last. I must say, the fashions at the time... One day, I had 100 francs in front of me, it was summer, so I drank less. I took the bus to Roissy. I knew Orly. I wanted to see Roissy. It was brand new. In the bus, which was packed, I realized I stank. It was awful. I was disturbing the guy next to me, but he said nothing. He was too polite. At Roissy, I washed and shaved. And I came home from Costa Rica. I called Angèle, who was my ex-wife, after all. I said I'd had my luggage and money stolen. She came to fetch me. Bye, the tramp. I'd come home from abroad. I never told anyone. No one at all. I didn't tell anyone. Not her or the boys. No one. You mustn't tell them. Angèle and Philippe are in the kitchen, with the rabbit. "Angèle and Philippe?" And where's Michel? Oh! Michel is with them. I'll go and help them. Shall we go, then? Shall we go? Michel said he'd wait for you in the car. He looked terrible. He looked in the yoghurt pot, he was pale. He leant over as if to talk to me, then changed his mind. He woke me up and said he'd wait for you. You didn't tell him about Costa Rica? What did he want to ask me? How to get me to marry him. Well, now you know what you must never mention. Yes. What is it? Costa Rica. Right. Goodbye. Trick or treat? No. We say that. Trick or treat? What are the tricks? Bog roll, spit, stickers. Wait, I've got something. Can I have some stickers, though? It's not safe for you to go about alone. Who knows who you might find? You shouldn't ring at doors like that. No problem, I'm with them. I wouldn't let them go alone either. Oh, right! Sorry. OK. Evening. I'm Marco, your destiny. May I come in? Sorry? I'm your destiny, may I come in? Sorry? I'm Marco, your destiny. May I come in? You want some treats? Why do you say treats instead of sweets? Don't be afraid. May I come in? Yes, OK. Aren't you surprised to see me dressed like this? Well... It's Halloween, it's late. I'll take this off. I'm hot. You should eat less of those. What are you supposed to be? Your destiny, Fontaine Leglou. What will I be? You are already. I'm a bit concerned. Will we have children? Can I smoke? Will things remain the same? Stop eating sweets. You'll be sorry. I don't need you to know that. So what can I know? I'm no fortune teller, I'm your destiny. Do you know Michel's destiny? Of course. But he's lazy. He'll never move. That's a pity. I won't stay. I have things to do. But... Don't you have anything else to tell me? - For a destiny, you're a bit... - I know. I need something to nibble on the way home. Don't you have anything more consistent? Like a chicken sandwich with a couple of beers? Yes, of course. But you want it right away? I've stopped. Not really. You'll smoke it. I'm here. That's something. Nothing's changed here. If we hadn't met at the gym, 1,000 euros a year and only my third session there, you wouldn't have called to ask me to come back? I didn't give orders. You called. You're here now. You said "one of these days". Exactly that, "one of these days". So this is "one of these days". I'm fine. I see no wedding ring. Did you get divorced? Still just as talkative, Dr Désert. I think that... you just don't want to stress your patients. What's that look? I'm smiling. I'm smiling. What about you? Me? I got a proposal of marriage. - Michel? - Michel. Well done! I mean, Strogoff. Michel Strogoff. And? And... To be honest, it reminds me of an unpleasant nap, when I was little. I pretended to swallow and spit out a sweet my aunt gave me. In fact it was a little S-shaped hook, and I swallowed it by mistake. Very good. Why is it "very good"? Do you know that? No. You know nothing. I need some advice. I need medical advice. Absolutely! And I've met someone. You're in love? I don't know. Anyway, I'm not not in love. We'll find out. - See you Thursday. - Thursday. Hello. How are you? Yes, fine. Thanks. May I? - Are you new? - Yes. Are you old? Do you know her well? You could put it that way. We all know her well. Only the train hasn't been on top of her. Notice, on top. She hates being on top. No way, I don't know why. She must be ashamed of her breasts, no? Or she keeps that for her boyfriend. He's a scientist and former triathlon champion. Biathlon? Triathlon. If you like her, go ahead. The key's in the lock, it doesn't work, the gate's open. They're all like that here. Patients and doctors, it's like a brothel. And as for outside... I feel I'm shocking you. Don't be shocked. Anyone here can tell you. You can ask. You wouldn't guess, but she's had nearly all of them. Medical staff, some patients. The less serious cases, mind. I must go. Sorry, but I have... I have a narcosis. Narcosis. The 3 security brutes too. Even the one who smells. You're giving me the injection? Yes. It's not my first time. You're still worried? What are you looking at? It's a general anaesthetic, after all. - You ever had one? - No. But I can give them. What are you looking at? You. None of that. No. It's for the injection. Oh! Sorry. - I heard awful things about you. - Yes. You'll feel the liquid pass into the vein. Oh! You know? Yes. I know! They said my politeness hides a cold, weak hypocrisy, I think only of myself, caring only about clothes, that I paid for my thesis, I'm neurotic, chaotic, I never come to staff parties, for new arrivals or leavers. That all my great efforts... You should start to feel it. It's OK. Your "great efforts" to...? To I don't know what. To hide the truth. They're always pathetic, ridiculous... And why I have no kids with my boyfriend, Nobel candidate... And triathlon champion. You know it all? But don't believe it. Don't think that... It's too much now. I feel like... I'm going to... Please, may I hold your hand? No. Better not. - Don't worry, it'll be OK. - It's just that... Just before, I saw a... A coffee, with no sugar. Is it serious? You saw a coffee with no sugar? But... Well! Where? No. You drank a coffee with no sugar. You drank a coffee with no sugar, it's no problem. Engagement? No. My engagement ring... I swallowed it yesterday. Sorry? Fork. Your sh... Porsche? Your shit. Oh, no! I didn't say that. No. You didn't. You didn't say that. You didn't say that. Wake up, wake up. It'll be OK. You didn't say anything, it'll be OK. You'll forget it all. It's not always recent memory. Nor is it always not that. - He'll forget. - But you won't. I just wanted to say the time's changed. You'll have lunch later. Oh? Oh, yes! I don't remember what I said before going to sleep. I said something I shouldn't have. What was it? I don't know, but... I can't remember. Something you can't say. Something awful, I think. So it's OK, you've forgotten. I'll check your blood pressure. Give me your wrist. You remember there's something to forget. Yes. Shit! What? No, no. Nothing. Hello. Hello. I'm alive. Thanks. Are your bowel movements OK, or do you want a laxative? No! Sorry? Can you leave us alone a moment, please? And... What work does your future husband do? This is the earth's inner nucleus. It's made of iron. Around it is the outer nucleus, made of iron and nickel. Then the magma, and finally the earth's crust, also called the mantle, I think. He studies plate tectonics. There are several large plates: the Eurasian, the American, the Antarctic. When the plates move apart, the gaps are filled by volcanoes. That's how the earth was formed - at least I think so - billions of years ago. You love him. I think so. It wasn't a question. You love him. Stop messing with me. Do you have a speciality? Gastro. Gastroenterology. It's not very sexy. It is. You're married. Yes. What do you think? Perfect. Do you like my beauty spot? Who cares? So it's yes? It's yes. But first... "First?" First, I must tell you something very important. My mother saw my father live as a tramp, and said nothing. She didn't tell us it was him. He was an alcoholic wreck, sitting in the street with the homeless, and... And begging: "Please, please." She hurried past, but she knew it was him. We saw him. It was after their divorce. Swear to me, if that happens, you'll see me. You'll see me. You'll see me? I'll see you, I'll see you. In fact... my period's late. If it's a girl, can we call her Elise? Yes. If it's a boy, Elie? OK. You know, about your father: he told me everything. It wasn't him. Your mother thought it was. You and Etienne, with your girlfriends, you thought it was him. Surely some tramp thought it was his wife to whom he held out his hand, his bowl, wrapped in his filthy blanket. A tramp hiding from his sons, who must have looked like you, but... You were mistaken. He was in Costa Rica. For two years. Building a bridge. An intelligent bridge. Know what that means? Anti-seismic. Costa Rica, my foot! In Costa Rica. I saw him, he saw me. No. Obviously, someone who looks like him knows someone who looks like you, but you're wrong. He was working over there. Are you sure? Yes. What do you expect? He's adventurous. Costa Rica. Right. Well, maybe. Nevertheless, you'd see me? I'd see you. There's a party at the Institute, in my honour. "A party?" With an areopagus. Yes, I know what that is. You've been chosen to go on the icebreaker to Greenland? To Alaska. Yes, it's me. I'm going for six months. So we marry and won't see each other for 6 months. If you want to come, you can. There's room for wives. Get leave of absence. But it's six months off the coast of Alaska. At minus 40 degrees. "Minus 40 degrees." I have to think about it. I'll be in the lounge. Shit, I'm smoking again. I'm ready. Subtitles: ECLAIR
