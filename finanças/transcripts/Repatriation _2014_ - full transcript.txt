(dramatic music) - I guess I can't say much for sand, like the shit you probably had to pull. We don't fight wars in easy places, do we? Some nights we would look over the delta, you know? On a really clear night, we could see all the boats, like 100 miles out. Because the lights of the boats reflected off the water or the atmosphere, we could see the boat ashore. We just looked out at the boats, wondering where are they going? Who's on them? They weren't all military. Some of them were fishermen, probably. I wish we could have been on the boats. Maybe comin' home... On a boat. Comin' the fuck home, you know? - Yeah. Nothin' like home. - Damn good! - Thanks. - Welcome home. - Thank you, sir. - Good to meet ya. - Thanks. Thanks again, gentlemen. - My pleasure. - Take care. - Good night, Len. - Good night. - Eh, two drinks and he's gone. - [Chad] Yep. - I've never seen it fail. Same thing every night. - It's discipline. - No, it's not discipline. He's headed for the VFW, he's gonna have a couple more drinks. (both laughing) - Of course he is. - So how long you in town? - Um, two nights. - Oh shit. I could have dragged you down to the ball field and made an example out of you. - Oh no. No way, nuh uh. (chuckling) - Well listen, we're gonna have to do it next time. - You got it. - Unless you want a ride home? - Yeah? I don't think I'm ready to go home just yet.

But I did grow up around here so-- - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, it's on the house. - [Chad] Hey, thanks. - You're gonna wink at him? I've been smilin' at you all night, baby. All right, I see how it is, I see it. - Hey, Felix. - What? Oh, damn, look at you! Nice threads! You know, I remember you talkin' about this. Get over here! Wow man, hey, some of the guys, they didn't think you'd actually go through with it. - Yeah, well you should have known me. - Hey I know you know that. - Hey man, I can't believe I caught you here. This is fuckin' awesome. - Oh, we're in town for Jenny's wedding. - Jenny? - Jenny Saunders, they call her Jennifer Saunders. - Oh yeah. - Did you talk with her in high school? - No, you hang out with her? - No, man. Man, she doesn't even know I'm here, our moms are friends. - Oh. - But hey, all I know is I'm gonna kick it with half of her bridesmaids so I'm good to be back. (Chad chuckling) Look at you, you're lookin' sharp. - Hey thanks, man. I mean, they, they really whipped me into shape down there, like, just pulled it right out of me. I don't know if you knew, I spent a couple of years inside, eatin' chips and feelin' sorry for myself, but goddamn if I didn't pull it out, right? - Shit, yeah. - Hey, you should enlist. You could use it. - Nah, fuck that. - Hey. - [Chad] Hey. - The uniform, they love it. - I'm tellin' you man, at least go down to recruiting, get yourself a free T-shirt. - Nah, that's for real men like you. - Fuck you, man. - Oh, hey, the Phils are here, you should come say hey. - Phil who? - Man you remember, come on. - All right. (laughing) - You lucky son of a bitch. - Twice! - Check it out. Look who I found hustlin' for drinks at the bar. - Hey, hey, hey. - Chad? - No way, man! - Hey, Phil. - What is up, man? - Good to see you, fellas. - Holy shit, I can't believe this! - Look at what you're doin' with your time. - Did you see him? He walks like a badass. - Yep, yep, I learned some shit. (group laughing) - Hey, I liked the old you. I mean, I wasn't afraid you could kick my ass if you remember. I liked Chad ever since Mrs. Franks gave him her phone number. - No, no, no, that's not what happened, I just bought her a sundae, an ice cream sundae. (Chad laughing) - Oh, yeah? I knew that part, but you got her number after, right? - Well I didn't get her number, but uh-- (group laughing) - Damn, she was hot! - So hot. - I was never late to that class. - Hi. - Hi, how's it going? - What'll you have? - Well, hello, hello. - Hi. - My name is Felix. This here is Phil, Phil, and this here is my boy Chad, just in case you couldn't see him in his camo. - Hi. - All right, all right, all right, let's see. Phil, bourbon and coke. - Bourbon and diet coke. - All right. And Phil... Hmm, vodka tonic. All right, and two scotch and sodas. - You got it. (Chad laughing) - [Chad] Thanks. - Another fuckin' wink. - What's the fuck up? Hey, thanks Phil. - Shit, thank you, man. Thanks for your service. - Hey, where were you stationed? - Well, I, I did my basic out in California, and then I did a little specialized training in North Carolina, and then I just kind of hung around Belgium before I got deployed. - [Phil] Good deal there. - Yeah. - Shit man, how was it? - Man, you wouldn't even believe me if I told you. Seriously, just indescribable. Yeah. But, but, hey, what have you been up to? How have you been? - Pretty good. Uh, doin' college online and uh, working at the feed store south on 43. - Feed store? - And fertilizer. (group laughing) - Hey, can you smell it? - Fuck you! - I don't know what you're talkin' about, man. Isn't he the best-smelling guy here? - [Felix] It's true, I'll admit it's true. - Hey, you should come down to the stores. - I'd love to, man. I always wondered if you guys kept the family business. - Yeah, yeah, we stuck it out. Looks like you are too. - Yeah, yeah, well you know how it is. (chuckling) And what about you, Phil? How's Elaina? - She's good. - [Chad] Well, give her my best when you see her. - No, absolutely. I mean, she'll be blown away that you were here tonight. - Hey, so you didn't marry that one girl? - Emily? - Yeah. - No. - Sure looked like being married. Reminded me of my fuckin' parents. - If she was here right now, and I didn't see you, she'd be on my list. - Hey, you go for it buddy. That is your loss, my friend. (Felix and Phils laughing) - All I knew is that the baseball star was gettin' some play, and I wasn't. - [Chad] What? - He's like, "To hell with this bitch. "I'd rather get shot at "before I wake up next to your ass!" (group laughing) - Hey! - Ah! - That was fast. - [Phil] Great, great, great. - Now listen, don't work too hard for us, baby. We got this, we'll take care of you. - [Chad] Yeah, thank you. - I heard it's not your first drink tonight. - Yeah, we're good friends, what can I say? (group laughing) - [Waitress] A few more shots, on me. - There we go. - Thanks. - Hey, to the armed forces, to Chad, and to the lovely ladies of Downing. - Aww, yes, Downing! - Yes! - Whoo! - Ahh! - Fuck all that high school bullshit, that's all done. All of the ladies that we've been talkin' about, they're divorced, or at least they're not hanging on the arm of some fuckin' jock in the letterman's jacket. - Hey, hey! That's okay. - Fellas, come on. Let's get back to the basics. Does this uniform get you laid or what? - [Phil] Huh, huh? - This guy, he's not gonna tell you nothin'. He never told me anything. - I never got a chance to talk to you about Emily 'cause you're so busy talkin' about all the ass you wanted to bang. - Seriously, who has time to talk about sex when fuckin' Felix is around? - Hey, that's not exactly-- - I'm gonna fuck it! (Phils and Chad laughing) - All right, maybe that is a little true. - [Phil] I'm gonna fuck it! - Exactly. - Hey, you wanna get another round of shots? - Oh, no, man, I'm good. I gotta hit the head before I split. - Lame. - Yeah yeah, me too. But we'll catch you guys in a minute. - Hey, good to see you, good to see you, man. - Good to see you too. - Good to see you, buddy. - [Chad] Good to see you too. Take care. - Wow. - Goddamn. Military man? - Shit, I just never thought he was the type. - I never thought I'd see that guy again. - [Felix] Goddamn, there's some good options out there tonight. - Yes sir, yes sir. - [Felix] Shit, Jenna Camp is out there, you remember her? - Uh huh. - [Felix] Yeah, I've wanted to see her naked since I was a sophomore-- - Not before? - Whatever. Anyway, she's not the only one. Now see, Valentine, Sherry Gibson, my God. Hey, you're a single boy now, yeah? - Damn straight. - All right, there we go. On leave, buff arms and your uniform? If there's ever a night, son, it's tonight. - Shit yeah. - There you go. They're a little young out there, but you know those girls. (Chad scoffs) - Who cares? - Exactly, who cares? (Felix chuckling) Well, we start leaving in a matter of hours, and the clock is ticking, soldier. - Shit yeah, buddy. Yeah. - Now listen, listen. This isn't all about me. You passed up on all of these honeys when you should have been nailin' 'em. It's 'cause of that stupid bitch of yours back in the day. - Right. - They liked you in your baseball outfit, but they're gonna love you in these camis, son. - Cheers. (Felix chuckling) - Hey, I know you. - [Chad] Of course you do. - You graduated with my cousin, Bradley. - Yeah, yeah. - Camille. - Chad. - Yeah, Taylor, I, I know. Um, you, you joined the military after college? - Yeah. You didn't see that comin', did you? - No, I didn't. Do you remember me? - Uh, yeah, yeah. I, I think so. What do you need? - What are you doing back? - Do you want to go outside? Let's go. - Yeah sure. - Okay. - Okay. (loud dance music) Wow, loud. - Yeah, yes. - Yeah. - [Both] So are you-- - I'm sorry, you first. - No, I was just gonna ask you who you're here with. - Um, Megan Masterson. A bunch of us from the south came up for the wedding. - Oh man, a lot of people came up for that. - Oh, I know. I am so glad I didn't come back for my 10 year reunion. (Chad chuckling) I think more people came back for this wedding. - I think you're right. - Yeah, it's nice to come back and visit, see what's changed. - Yep. Man, you have no idea. (Camille chuckling) - So what, were you on like, multiple deployments or something? - Uh, yeah, yeah, somethin' like that. - Crazy. - Yeah. - Do you remember where I know you from? - Didn't we go to high school together? - Yeah, but we never had any classes together. You were so much older. - I can't be that much older than you, come on. - No, but a year back then is like decades. - Oh, I'll give you that one, yeah. - It's not where I remember you from. - I'm totally lost. - You played baseball with my brother, Trevor. - Oh yeah, that's right, that's right. - Our family used to throw the big party-- - You did cook-offs. - Yeah, so we would have all this food. It was like the highlight of the week for me. - Oh, that was great man, that was so great. - [Camille] Yeah. - Yeah, it was great having that cheering squad, especially on those days that we were, you know, we were losing, which there were... - Yeah. - One or two. (Chad chuckling) - Yeah. (Camille chuckling) - Yeah. - But your dad was there sometimes too, right? - [Chad] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I remember him. - Yeah, so, are you guys just back for the party, or-- - Oh, well that, and I'm visiting my folks, and, you know, they're VHS graduates too, so, um, they've got all this hometown school spirit, you know? - [Chad] Nice. - Yeah, it's sweet. I'm over it now though. - Oh yeah? - I moved to the city, but I've seen all the, all I need about that. - That's it? - All that. That's pretty much it. (Chad chuckling) Hey, do you remember Susie Bernacki? - Uh, no. - Oh, well, she moved to New York City. - Oh wow. - Yeah, I mean, you've like, what? Been around the world 10 times or something? Yeah, for me, I, I just couldn't move to New York, no. - Oh no? - No. But I did stop going to high school baseball games after I graduated. - [Chad] Oh, that's good. - Yeah, so I might be afraid of New York City, but I have no problem walking away from high school sports. - Well, you will not be like your parents, though. - I hope not. (Chad chuckling) Oh, I mean it's sweet, but maybe if I was like, 50 or something. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So are you here with Felix and those guys? - Yeah. Phil, Felix, and Phil. Yeah, we used to all hang out with the same people so... - Felix is a little creepy for my taste. - What? (Camille laughing) Felix just has a really healthy appetite for sex. I mean, come on. - He is a little too aggressive for me. - Okay, okay. - Just sayin'. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah. No, I, I'm actually here by myself. I, I was just kind of passing through, grabbing a drink through town. - [Camille] Oh really? - Yeah. Well, I got in tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah. So I went across the street to the VFW there. - Okay. - And I saw this old guy, and he said somethin' about grabbin' a drink across town. Good to meet you, sir. - I'm, uh, obligated to give you some, what I think is good advice. - Okay. - You can't follow your buddies all night and keep up with them while they're buyin' you thank you drinks. - Well thank you, sir. Uh, honestly I'm not even sure I'll run into anyone I even know, so (chuckling) - Uh, it won't just be your friends. Why, two guys, total strangers, they'll be arguin' over who's gonna buy you a drink, and you might just end up with both. - I get it. He said I'd get handed a drink all the way home. So I figured, "What the hell?" Nice way to make a homecoming, right? - [Camille] Yeah. - Yeah. So, this is my first stop and, after that, maybe uh, Blue Lagoon or Bill's. At that point, I'd be almost back to my old man's place. - That sounds like fun. So you're not back for the wedding at all? - Uh, no, not at all, pure chance. I kind of, uh, I don't really know those people too well so-- - Oh well, maybe you'll get a chance to visit with a lot of people this weekend too. - Yeah, hopefully my dad won't keep me inside too much. He's been known to keep me locked up a little bit. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. (Camille chuckling) (Chad exhaling sharply) So, how long are you here for? - Oh, just the weekend. - Ah. And then right back to the city? - Yep. - What's that, like a six hour drive? - Sometimes five. (Camille laughing) - Nice, nice. - So wait, you're headed to Adelay's next? - [Chad] Yeah, yeah. - Okay, cool. - Do you want to go? - Are you drafting me for your beer crawl? - Uh, no. I mean, I'm not drafting you. You gotta enlist. I mean, you gotta want this. - Oh do I? - Yes. - Okay. Okay, well, consider me enlisted. - Great, great, perfect. - Great. - This is great, cool. Um, so, wanna go back in? - Cool, okay. Uh, no, no, I'll just stay here. - Okay, cool, I'll be right back. - Bye, thanks. - [Leslie] Hey, is that Chad Tyler? - Leslie. - Wow, look at you! Military! - Yeah, just got back in tonight. - You look great! - [Chad] Thanks. - Chad, this is my friend Donna. Her new husband's in the military too. - Oh, no kidding? - Yeah, where you at? - Well, thankfully back here for a bit. - Oh, okay, okay. Where you stationed? - [Chad] Uh, Belgium. (gasping) - Oh cool, my fiance might wanna go there so bad! - Husband. - Oh right! (Donna and Chad laughing) - She forgets she's married. - It's the uniform. (all laughing) - Actually, his name's Thomas, you'd know him. - Huh, yeah, I dunno. But Leslie, what about you? Did you marry a military man? - Uh, no, loan officer. - Oh, didn't say that comin'. - Yeah, me either. We actually have a two year old. - Wow, sorry to hear that. (Leslie and Donna laughing) - Oh, he's a handful, but-- - Yeah, well-- - Listen. I don't know if we ever had a legal drink with each other. You hangin' around? You wanna buy a girl a drink? - Oh, I'm headin' out, actually. I got somebody waitin' for me outside. - [Leslie] Oh, okay. - Well, I'll see, um, I'll see you later. - Wait, hey, hey, Jodie Baker's in town and having people over if you wanna catch up more? - Okay, cool, I might do that. - It's behind the dealership. Right, way over there. - That's right, that's right. Good to see ya, good to see ya. Take care. - A soldier. (Donna chuckling) - [Camille] Hey! - [Chad] Ready to go? (light gentle music) Oh, a friend of mine told me about a party at Jodie Baker's? - [Camille] Right, I heard, do you know her? - Yeah, yeah. You too? - She's a bit older, but we met at Capitol. - Yeah. So you up to walkin' this? - I might not be a boots camp expert, but I'm pretty sure I can walk across it-- - It's boot. Just one. - Oh really? - Yeah. - Okay, that might be the alcohol. (Chad laughing) Bootcamp, whatever. I think I can handle it. But we're running, right? - Yeah. - I do run cross. (Chad laughing) Run 'em. Will you be okay? - Yeah. - Can you keep up with me okay? - I think I can. - Okay. (upbeat acoustic guitar music) Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! All right, let's just walk. - Okay. - Oh man. Maybe I'm not cut out for bootcamp after all. - I dunno. Military's not all big, tough guys. - Like you? - Yeah, I'm a good example. But I'm not as big and tough as some of the guys, you know? That doesn't make me any less of a soldier. There's a lot more to it than boots camp. (Chad laughing) - Shut up, it was one mistake! - Yeah but, boots camp was pretty tough though. (Chad laughing) No, they did push us to our limit. - Run in the mud, do sit-ups all the time? - Mostly push-ups. - Getting yelled at all the time? - Yep. - Guys calling you maggot all day long? - Uh huh. - Hey, I saw Full Metal Jacket. They got all sorts of mean things to say. - Yeah. (chuckling) You see this lamp here? - Yeah? - Oh. So, so this one time, I was coming up like this, to make a turn here, 'cause of the lane here, but I didn't see this guy coming from over there. (chuckling) So I swerved like this to avoid him, and hit this pole. Just ran right into it. - Jeez. - Yeah. - Was that in your Pontiac? - [Chad] You know my car? - Um, well-- (Chad laughing) I saw it at the games and, your girlfriend Emily used to talk about it, so-- - Oh, you remember that? Huh. No, it was a Blazer. Thank God no one got hurt. (chuckling) Yeah. - Hey, we should go to the bowling alley. - [Chad] What? - Yeah, I mean, I thought you were all about having a drink all the way, all the way home. I mean, why not there? - All right, let's do it. - Okay.

I'm gonna play the right. - All right. - This is perfect, this is exactly how pinball is supposed to be played, doubles. - Teamwork, just like the Marines? - Yep, you got it. - [Camille] Okay, point. - Okay, okay, hit that one more time. - What, where? - This one right here. Okay, you see how those two lights are lit and this third one's not? - Yeah. - Just hit it one more time. We'll be a bonus or something, a bunch of points. - Well, how do I hit it again? - Just, just, from your side, with the flipper, I can't get it from mine. - It's a flipper, it doesn't aim! - Seriously, is this your first pinball game? - Yes. - Okay, just, just, it's just all in how long you wait.

Let's go soldier. (Camille chuckling) - [Camille] Okay. (chuckling) (upbeat rock music) - Dean! (Dean laughing) - Holy shit! Look at you! Chad Tyler, look at this uniform. - Yeah man, great to see you. - What the fuck are you doin' here? - I just got back into town, just stopped in to take a piss. - Some uh, buddies and I are gonna start some league qualifiers out there, you wanna stick around? - Oh no, I'm, we're just kinda-- - Oh, you here with your pop? - No, no, I'm, I'm back there with this girl playing a game of pinball. - Pinball? - Yeah. - Seriously? They teach you that in the desert? (both laughing) Piss, pinball, you're a fuckin' pussy. Sarah, can we-- - Oh no, Dean-- - Shut the fuck up. We're all in uniform. - You like that? - Let's go. Let's do this. - All right. - [Dean] Let's go do this. Easy. - I lost. - Team sport. - So we stickin' around? - Uh, just ran into a buddy of mine. Uh, Dean Watkins, I went to college with him. Do you know him? - I don't think so. - Yeah, he, he was wondering if we could, I dunno if you got somewhere to go-- - No, let's do it! Totally. - Oh. - Yeah. - Great. - Come on, throw that rock baby, right down the middle. Let's go. Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my old buddy, uh, Chad. And his friend, Camille. Chad here was out servin' our country while you guys were donkey punching each other's buttholes. (group laughing) - Hey. Hey, how you doin'? - Hey, good to meet you. - I'm Neal, nice to meet you. - [Chris] Hey man, good to see you again. - Hey Chris. - Hello, hello. This is my wife Sandra. - Hi! - Hi, Sandra. - Nice to meet you. - [Camille] Nice to meet you. Sandra? - Oh, Camille, right? - Nice to meet you. - Okay, hi. Nice to meet you. - Oh. Oh, Julie Smith? - How are you? - How about that? What a nice surprise. - [Dean] Oh, you guys know each other? - Yeah. His uh, old girlfriend was a good friend of mine. - Oh yeah? - Small world. - Yeah. Emily Johnson, we dated all through high school. - How you been? - I've been great, really great. But you look great. - Thanks. Hi, Camille. I'm Julie. - Julie, nice to meet you. - [Julie] Nice to meet you too. Are you bowling tonight? - Yes, I think we are. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think we're gonna split a game while we catch up. (pins clattering) (all cheering) - All right. - [Dean] Chad and I, we went to the same college. - Yes we did. - And I stayed here and drank beer. He went and became a lethal weapon. Derrick here can't even pick up his fuckin' spare. - Fuck you. (Chad laughing) - So what the hell have you been up to? - Man, uh, same old, same old. Um... Like you, with the, finished the third year of college. Like you, I couldn't take it so, then my old man passed away, I've been on the farm ever since. Got a great wife, she's home taking care of the kids. - [Chad] Nice, nice. - Yeah, um, big changes from pukin' outside of Marley Hall. - Sounds like it. (Chad laughing) - Don't get me wrong, I drink the same amount. It's just the setting here is a little bit different. - Yeah. - [Derrick] Watkins did flash his man booby last week. (Chad laughing) - It's kind of like college, you know? The little twists. - Yeah, yeah. - So now I'm married and settled down and, you're livin' the bachelor life, and divorced. - Yes, a lot has changed since Emily and I split. - Yeah. You know, I uh, I think it just kind of took its tool on ya. It's good to see you back in good spirits. - Thanks, buddy. - Didn't you catch him with your girlfriend in college? - She wasn't my girlfriend, Julie. - But you liked her. - What's the problem? Everybody liked her Julie, huh? - Oh. - When I got my divorce, that's when I decided to leave town and join it. - You joined the military 'cause of her? - More like in spite of her. I mean, who wants to be with somebody who just likes you 'cause you're good at sports or you're popular in high school? You know? I mean, the military accepted me for who I was so-- - You've gotta have a woman who's gonna let you be you. Right? - What the fuck would you know about that? - Well I tell ya, a little known fact. Stovers here has never seen or been seen by his wife taking a shit. - What? - True story. - What, what the hell is wrong with that? - Everything. - Oh God, right? - Dude you got a, you have a poop fetish? Is that the thing? You're really into that, aren't you? - Annette must be the luckiest woman alive to be so conscious of your rectal activities. - Mine? She shits all day long. That's the point I'm trying to make. - Can we talk about something else? - [Chad] Oh man, Dean, some things just don't change. - They never do. You just gotta keep moving forward. That's what I'm-- - If you're not gonna change the subject, then I will. Camille, how'd you two meet? - We hardly know each other at all, really. Um, just kind of moving in the same direction. - No, we're going to Adelay's next, then after that, Jodie Baker's, maybe? - Oh, I might not make it that far, but um, we were walking right past here, and I reminded him of the bar, so we stopped in. - Lucky me. Chad Tyler travels all the way from Luxembourg to drink with us. - Luxembourg may be great, but Luxembourg does not have you, sir.

I mean, not tomorrow, 'cause my wife'll fuckin' kill me, but, you know-- (Chad chuckling) But maybe, you know, next week, stay for a few nights. We got beautiful land out there. - That'd be great, man. I'd love that. - So Chad, you must have seen some pretty crazy stuff out there, huh? - Yeah, man. They sent me all over the place. - Man, I would be so freaked out. Hey, do you take your ID with you everywhere? - Yeah, of course. - But I mean, if you're in Iraq, or North Korea or something, and you're out in the city, like, I don't mean on base, but out in the city, and you lost your ID, I mean, wouldn't you be nervous? - I think at that point, my ID would be the least relevant thing, you know what I mean? - Yeah, I guess. Man, I would be so freaked out. - So but, I mean, you get discounts everywhere you go though, right? - Well, everyone's been buying him a drink since the bus station. - Here, let me sink one more gutterball, then I'll get your number after that, about comin' out to the farm. - All right. - Hey, great to meet you. - All right, thanks buddy. - Be safe, be strong. - Yeah, thanks buddy. - Take care, guy. - Good to see you. - Good to see you again. - Good to see you, Chris. - Take care. - Thank you. - Buddy. - Yeah? - All right. (chuckling) See you later. - I don't know why I did that. All right, go, get out of here. Derrick, take your fuckin' shirt off. If the chick can pick up a spare, you're out. Camille! You're on for us next week. - Okay. - [Dean] We're kickin' the bearded guy off. - Okay. - All right, I love you. - I love you too. - No, I love you more. - Have a good night! - I love you! - See you guys later. - See you, buddy. - [Chad] Take care. - Well that was crazy. - I fuckin' hated that guy in high school. - [Chad] Remember Sam? - Ooh. - Oh yeah. - All too well. - Yeah. (Camille chuckling) - No, um, you were always like that. Well, at least you were with the baseball crowd. - What? - Okay, this is gonna be funny to talk about right now, but um... I paid extra attention to you in high school. (Chad chuckling) I mean, you were a senior with this beautiful girlfriend and the star of the baseball team-- - I thought Jeff was the star of the baseball team? - Oh, sure, we all loved him but, he wasn't the only one. - Oh... - Well, it's not like you care! I was a few years younger anyways. - Not that much. - Sure, now, but back then, it's huge. - Yeah, I guess. - And you and Emily were practically-- - Got married, yeah. Not the first time I heard that tonight. Yeah (scoffs) I know, probably looked that way but, most high school relationships are measured in weeks so-- - Right, you guys were. I mean, I didn't even know you'd broken up. - Yeah. You just, you know, you get older and you learn stuff about yourself, you change. Whatever all that means, I don't know. - I get it. - I mean, I'm sure you feel the same way. - Yeah, yeah. - You didn't say all this about Emily before. - Right. Um, well-- (Chad chuckling) I think-- - [Chad] You're a little liar! - Oh, I'm not a liar! - But you didn't say any of that, I mean-- - Oh, I know what I said. I mean-- - Okay. - I wanted to catch up with you. If, if I would have mentioned it before, you would have thought I was crazy, so, we wouldn't have walked or anything. - No, I would have walked with you but, I mean, if I had a car, I wouldn't have let you in, but-- - Oh, oh. Thanks, I see how it is. - Yeah. - Okay, I'll, I'll admit that um, I used to kiss up to Emily at the games in the hopes to hear about you. (Chad laughing) I wasn't envious or anything! I mean, she was amazing and this woman, and, I was just a kid. Um, I just had a crush. So, I was more than happy just to hear about you. - So you did talk to Emily, though? - Well, not really. I mean, I would follow her around at the games or um, if we saw her somewhere, zero in. (Chad chuckling) It's embarrassing. - Now wait a second. - What? - Yeah, I think... Yeah, I think one of my favorite little bars is right around here. - Another detour? - No, no, I, I, I've been wanting to go to this place all night. It's a great little bar. - [Camille] Do we have time? - Yeah, I don't think we have enough time for this place. Trust me, you, you'll love it. - [Camille] Well how far is it? - I think it's right around, oh, it's right here. Oh, yeah. - [Camille] Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's closed. - Yeah, I had such a good time in this place. I wonder how long? - I didn't even know there was a bar here so, it must have been a while. - Shit. - Bummer. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Where to next. - Adalay's? - Yeah. Yeah, maybe Felix made it. - Well, you don't have to worry about that. My friend Wendy will buy you free drinks if you keep that uniform on. - Well, you be sure to introduce us, 'cause I don't think Felix made it. - No. Hey, uh, there's some buddies for you. - Hello, sir. Private First Class Kelly. - Kelly. - This is PFC Corell. - Corell. - Hey um, find me after-- - Yeah. Copy that. - Gentlemen. - Ma'am. - [Chad] So, you guys wanna buy me a drink? - Hey! - Hi! - [Camille] Wendy, it's good to see you! - We weren't sure if you were coming. - I know, I'm sorry. Um, do you guys remember Chad Ty, Taylor, Tyler? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Is that who you just came in with? - Yeah. We walked here together. - That's like three miles away. - Um, well we stopped at the bowling alley. Hey. It was fun, I mean, I was on fire. And you know what? I don't really bowl but, it's gonna sound a little crazy, the beer totally helps. I mean, who would have guessed, right? - I'm sure. (Camille chuckling) - And you guys found something to talk about the whole way here? - Of course. Um, he's-- - He's, he's not married to Emily, is he? - No, I, I thought he would be too. - Ha, yeah right. That shouldn't have lasted a month. - You think so? - No way, not him. Is he gonna be here all night? - Hey, you, you got one. - What? - A free drink. I mean, he's gotten a free drink at every stop since the bus station. - Who the hell takes the bus? - So what's he like? - Um, fun. I mean, I, I don't really know anyone in the military so, and he seems normal, but, I wouldn't go so far as to say he was cool. I mean, we played team pinball. - Well, and you, you got a free drink? - Yes, we got some beers. And I even got a strike. - Nice. Uh, it's, it's far worse than bootcamp. I mean, it's, it's hot as shit. You're pissin' and shittin' in a fuckin' hole in the ground, just waitin' for the fighting to start. (scoffs) Sometimes it's weeks. Sometimes it's hours. (scoffs) All those big, tough guys you looked up to turn into a bunch of fuckin' pussies. Those little unsuspecting guys, those guys turn into demon fuckin' killing machines, man. - What's wrong with you? - Nothin', I was just thinkin'. - [Wendy] Do you like him? - Oh, I was just wondering what it's like, like, to come back here, after being over there and seeing all that stuff, and then come back to this little town again? - He doesn't have PTSD or anything, does he? - I honestly don't know. - I don't get it. - Well, I mean, it's kind of sad. Nothing better to do on your first night back? - What's wrong with this? - Yeah, it's what we're doing. - You too. - Right, that, it's fine, I mean, I guess it just seems different. Like, where's his family? - He found his friends, isn't that good enough? - They're not his friends, he just met them. - Is he hanging out with us all night? - All night? I thought we were leaving. - I mean, no, I mean he's going to another party. Um, why did you think he and his girlfriend wouldn't last? - I don't know. I just never heard many good things about him. - Like what? - Didn't you ever notice that he didn't really have many guy friends? - That's a strange reason not to like him. - I heard that he slept with Tiffany Philipcowski at the state tournament when she was a freshman. - I don't think guys like him very much. I think he slept with a lot of girls. - [Chad] Fuck yeah. Hey, don't fuckin' ask me that. That's not cool. I'm not about to just talk with you about that stuff. I hope you understand that. - Totally man, sorry. - I mean, it's not easy, it's not fuckin' easy, you know? Good soldiers, good goddamn soldiers. (sighing) Forget all that. Just take care of the guys on either side of you, you'll be good to go. Yeah. Yeah. - Cheated on her? No, no way. - Well, I think so. Well, that's what I heard. - She didn't find out 'til way later. - Are we going? I don't want to be hung over and tired at the wedding. - Okay. Uh, I'm at least gonna say goodbye, so... - Okay. - I'll meet you ladies outside. - Finally. - Bye. - I think he's a creep. - He is a creep. - Wanna get me another beer? - Hey um, we're taking off now, so... - Uh... (chuckling) The perks, hold on one second. Hey uh, sorry about that. Those guys kind of caught me. I didn't mean to leave you alone or-- - No that's, that's fine, I understand. I know you military guys. Brothers with strangers, or somethin' like that. - Yeah, somethin'. Uh, it's not like we played pinball together, right? (Camille chuckling) - Right. Well, I had a great time tonight, you know, walking, and catching up with you but um, we're taking off. - Already? - Yeah, well, we all were together so I'm, you know, in school though. Um, I'm glad I got to run into you. - Well I, you don't really want to leave yet, do you? - Well, I told you we all were together. - Right, but, why do you have to leave right now? - I can't exactly rely on you to get me home. (Camille chuckling) - I'll get you home safe. - Yeah, I bet you would, soldier. - I mean, if you wanna take off something, you know? I don't want to play darts with them anymore. We can just uh... - Uh, it's not that. - I mean, unless you want to stay here, you can be my cheering squad again. No Emily, just you. - Chad, you don't-- - Come on, come on. - That's, that's not what I meant. - Okay, I thought we were havin' a good time here tonight? - We were. - Okay, so? So, what the fuck is the problem? - Nothing. Um, just, nothing but um, could we get together tomorrow? (Chad chuckling) - Tomorrow? - Yeah. - Tomorrow. Okay. - Yeah. I, I was having a great time tonight. It's just uh, I haven't seen you in 10 years, and I really shouldn't just... - Is it, is it because you don't trust me? - Can I just call you tomorrow? - No, you can't fucking call me tomorrow. Fuck tomorrow, what the fuck is wrong with tonight? - Um-- - This is my first night back. - Because I can't. - This is my first night back. - Okay? Sorry? - Is this it? - Yes, I-- - Do you know how many girls would literally fucking kill to be in your position right now? - I have a pretty good idea, yeah. So um, I think I need-- - Good, good. - I think I need to leave. Stop it. - I'm, I'm not fucking doing anything tomorrow, okay? - Just, stop it. I need to go. Shit. - [PFC Kelly] Hey, would you like another one, sir? - Yeah. Thanks, fellas. Just give me one second. (slow rock music) Ah. You guys excuse me for a second? I'll be right back. (dramatic music) Wait, wait, wait, wait. (slow rock music) (pool balls clattering) - What you need, friend? - [Chad] Uh, whiskey. - Gotcha. (pool balls clattering) - Uh, okay. So that one's yours. Two out of three? - That'll be $4. - [Chad] I guess I gotta pay for this shit now. Oh.... - [Lance] Why are you laughing? Come on. I was distracted, okay? (laughing) You got that? - Okay. - [Lance] You realize it was your ball? Okay, asshole. Two out of three. - All right, all right. - Two, three, this is the third game. Yes, this is it. ♪ This is it All right. (both laughing) - [Lance] Hey, Lance. Hey. - Chad... Why the fuck are you wearin' that? - Oh. (chuckling) Yeah, I just, I just got back in town just tonight. Ah. What, how've you been? What have you been up to? - We've been all right. Things are pretty much back to normal now. - Oh great, that's great. You guys uh, you gonna play a game here or-- - That's the idea. - All right, hey, you mind if I cut in? It's okay, I mean, Lance and I are like, well, we're practically like brothers, right? - Fuck, man, I don't think this is a good idea. I think you should just let this one ride. - Oh come on, man. Just, just, I mean, when are we gonna get a chance to do something like this? - Like what? - Well I just got in tonight. I've been gone for a while. I mean, why can't we just, you know, play a game and catch up? - Oh, come on, dude. - Well you don't care, do you? - No, no man, here. - Thanks, thanks. Come on. Who cares, right? - Sure. Sure. - You break, you're the oldest. - What's up, Chad Tyler? (pool balls clattering) - I just been gone for a while. Just, funny being back home. (chuckling) - And you just enlisted in the Army? - Yep. (Lance sighing) - So you here to say somethin'? - [Chad] What do you mean? - Why the fuck are we talkin'? I mean, why do you want to play so bad? - I just, I just saw you here. I thought it'd be nice to play a game or catch up. - This is chance, you comin' here? - Yeah. Yeah, I just got in at the station and I was just rollin' through town, seein' people, catchin' up, you know. - [Lance] Is that right? - Yeah. Yeah, it's been great. People buyin' me a drink at every stop. But to be fair, I, I think it's the uniform, I don't think it's really me. - Oh yeah. It certainly ain't you. So what? Am I expected to buy you a drink too? - Lance, that's one heck of a nice thing to offer. - I, I'll get it, you guys go ahead. - Thanks. (pool balls clattering) - Soldier? - Yep. - You think that'll finally make your dad proud? (Chad chuckling) - You know, when your sister and I broke up, I just, I just really needed to get out of town, start somethin' new, you know? - To what? Avoid the fallout? - Listen man. Every place I go tonight, yeah, people tell me how I was pretty much married to Emily. And... You know, I cared for her, a lot. And I grew up with her here in this town. She's everywhere, so... - What about my Blazer, man? You never said anything about that. - I didn't know you were still upset about it-- - No, I'm not upset. What am I, some kind of pussy? No, no, it just pisses me off. Thanks, buddy. - Hey thanks, man. (slow rock music) I guess I'm up? - So, does uh, Army Chad fuck all his girlfriend's friends too? - Whoa... - What are you talkin' about, Lance? - You did a good job of avoiding, dusting off this shit for a long time. I thought you were just hiding. I didn't know that you decided to go out and play soldier. (Chad chuckling) - What the fuck are you-- - Look man, we had a lot of good times together, we really were like family... Brother. But then when shit came down, she started hearing, one by one, all these girls coming out and admitting this. We start hearing these stories, she was a wreck! Don't get me wrong, I hid my sister. I had my own shit to deal with. But you fucked with us real good. Now you have to imagine, she had to be pretty fucked up to get my sympathy. No one likes you. Nobody wants to see you. So you should get the fuck out of here before something happens. - Listen, man. We were just... We were just kids. - Whatever, I don't want to hear your excuses. - Well. all right then. I think I'm gonna take off. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, I, I... I've only got so much time. I don't need to take this shit. People don't hate me, Lance. They don't. I'm actually going to a party right now, and I'm invited. - Go back to your dad. I'm sick of seeing you. - You know what? Not everyone hates me. Lance, not everyone. If no one liked me, why am I goin' to a party right now? That fuckin' bitch... (Lance sighing) - I thought he was gonna go PTSD there for a second-- - [Lance] Fuckin' loser! No, no, it's not anything like that. - Yeah, you know, maybe he needs some help? - Trust me. It's nothing like that. (pool balls clattering) (dramatic music) - [Daniel] Hey bro, what the fuck you doin'? - Oh I'm just, I'm just cuttin' through. - [Daniel] It's the middle of the fuckin' night, man. - Hey I know man, I'm just, I'm just cuttin' through. - Yeah, I heard you man. Where's your fuckin' hat? - Oh. Oh, yeah. I got it right here. - Don't worry about it, I'm not your fuckin' CO. - Come on, man. - I'm just sayin' man, that's a pretty clean uniform. - Oh yeah, you know how it is, right? I mean (chuckling) - You're pretty fucked up, huh? - [Chad] Yeah, yeah. - [Daniel] Why don't you take a seat, man? - [Chad] All right, all right. (Chad sighing) - You're pretty fucked up, man. - Yeah, man. (both laughing) - Where you comin' from? - Oh man. (chuckling) I have been all over this town tonight. I went to Spike's-- - No man, fuck this town. Station. I was out of Fort Hood. We were the last to roll out of Iraq. You overseas? - Oh nice, man. So you were, you were-- - Yeah, man, I did my fuckin' time. - Nah, nah, I, I, I don't want to get you fired or somethin'. - Fuck that. The last thing these guys wanna do is fire me. They're so fuckin' happy to help out a vet. Fire? No man. You'll see. There's people kissin' your ass, offering you some $9 an hour job just because they see you in your uniform. Use it while you got it, man. Because once that uniform goes away, nobody fuckin' knows. What the fuck is this? See now it's Taylor this, Taylor that. But they won't know your fuckin' name after you take it off. They fuckin' forget shit real fast. Some fuckin' backlog bullshit. Soon, they won't know who the fuck you are. Shit, I could have been a doctor faster than I could pay these bills. So you from here? - Yep, yep. - You go to Downing? - No, no. - My wife went to Downing. I'm not from here. Nice town? You back to being in reserve? - What? - You back for good, is this home for you, what? - Yeah, yeah. I guess so. - [Daniel] You don't sound too happy to be home. (Chad sighing) - You know, it's, it's funny. There's some nights, we just look out over the delta, you know, on a really clear night, we could see all the boats, like 100 miles out. I dunno, the light just reflected off of the water or the atmosphere or somethin'. I would just look at these boats, and I would just wonder, where are they goin'? Who's on them? And they weren't all military, some of them were fishermen, probably. But I just wished I could have been on one of those boats, maybe comin' home. And now I am home. And I don't know. - Water? Where the fuck were you? - I was there, man. I was fuckin' there. (Chad sighing) - Where you off to, bro? - I'm goin' to a party. - Oh. Meetin' some girl, huh? - Yeah. This girl in high school, she had a crush on me, she never did anything about it because I always had a girlfriend. And now I'm gonna go fuck her. - Nice, bro. Nice. So kind of a reunion night, huh? - Damn straight. (Daniel chuckling) - [Daniel] So you leavin'? - Yeah man. - No. You need to, you need to talk. You need to talk to somebody about the shit you saw over there. You, you need someone to talk to. That's not normal shit that you see every day. I don't have anybody to talk to. Who, who the fuck am I gonna talk to in this town? - I don't know, man. - You can't just keep that shit in. All that stuff-- - Yeah, I know. - Those bodies? - [Chad] I know, man. - It's not shit that you see every day. - I, look, I didn't see anything. - You didn't see anything? - I didn't fuckin' see anything, okay? - Okay. - Look, I gotta go man. I can't stay. - Whatever, man. (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) (crunching) - What's up, man? (electronic beeping) Comes out to $6.57. - $6.57? - Yeah, it's plus tax, and a nickel, for the bottle deposit. - There's no discount? - What kind of discount are you lookin' for? - Fuckin' military discount. - This is a driver's license. Oh yeah, hey, yeah. Nice man, nice uniform. Yeah, seriously. No, I got mine at the uh, surplus store down south. But here, we ID. Are you fuckin' serious? Let me see this shit. - Fuck you, man. (chuckling) - Oh, no way. Are you sure you get fuckin' laid with that uniform? Are you-- - Fuck you. - Are you actually trying to get 15% off fuckin' beer and condoms? - Fuck you. - That's a total first. Dickhead. (electronic beeping) (dramatic music) (car horn honking) (upbeat rock music) (people talking quietly) - Yeah, I'll take uh, whatever domestic you got there. - Who are you? - I'm supposed to meet Leslie here. I saw her at Spiked. - So, who are you? - I'm Chad Tyler. - Yeah, well, why don't you bring Leslie over here, uh, Chad Taylor? (Chad scoffs) - Fine. - [Leslie] Chad? Chad, Chad. - Oh hey, there you are. (Leslie chuckling) I need a drink, God, you saved my life. - Here, you can have mine. - Thanks. - Listen, I think you should take off. I'm sorry to invite you over here just for us to leave, but I-- - I, I just got here. I've had people buying me drinks everywhere I go all night. - I don't think that's such a great idea. I think you should go. - Okay. Why don't you uh, why don't you give me your number? - Uh, I'm, I'm married, Chad. - Yeah, so what? So what? I mean, you used to give me your number, right? - No, I don't think so. - Okay, hey, look. Who's gonna know? - What the hell is wrong with you? - Hey, is there a problem here? (Chad chuckling) - I just need a drink is all. - I remember you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You're that guy, uh, Chad. - Yeah, yeah man. - Yeah, I used to be with Tiffany Philipcowski. Uh, at the state tournament. She was my girlfriend. I don't forget that shit. - What, what are you talkin' about? (Chad scoffs) - Yeah, you heard me. My girlfriend, Tiffany Philipcowski. Yeah, I took her to prom a week later. Didn't even know. You shit. - Hey, I've seen this asshole. He worked at the storage place south of town. - Oh, you think you're somethin' special, huh? My brother enlisted because he loves this country. That's why he wears the uniform. So why the fuck are you wearin' it? - Do you want me to call the cops? - No, no man. No, no. I, I'll just, I'll just go. I'll take off. - [Mark] Fuckin' disgrace. (dramatic music) (people cheering) - [Chad's Father] Chad? Chad? - What? - Son? You okay? - Huh? - [Chad's Father] Yeah, yeah, it's me. Let me get you in the house, okay? - [Chad] Yeah. - [Chad's Mother] You're gonna wake the neighbors! - Mom? - Yeah, it's your mom. - What? - Okay, let's stand up. And, okay. All right, arm around me. My uh, all right. - Yeah, my-- - Okay. Straight down the walk now, all right? Hold on to me, yeah. You're not gonna get sick, are you? - [Chad] No. - All right. - No. Fine, I'm fine. - Yeah. Yeah? We'll get you inside, you'll be all right. All right, big step, up. Come up, on the stairs then we'll take a break, come on. Hold on to me. - [Chad's Mother] There's nothing but dirty laundry in here. What are you doing? - [Chad's Father] Just letting him spend one night in his room. Come on, come on. - [Chad's Mother] Why is he wearing a uniform? - [Chad's Father] You're lucky someone didn't kick your ass. - Oh, I was cool again, dad. I was, I was cool. - You're cool, son, you're cool. - I was cool. - Come on. (dramatic music) Son, you gotta quit doing this. You gotta quit lying to people. Now roll over. Go to sleep. I'll see you in the morning.
