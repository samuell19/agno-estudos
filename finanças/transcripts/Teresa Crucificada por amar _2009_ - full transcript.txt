This party is my last here at home. My home. My father awaits me for the first dance. Ines, my sister, celebrates her birthday... Who is she? Teresa Wilms Montt, the celebrated's sister. I know that, cousin. Tell me something I don't know. She's as beautiful as sin itself. Dona Luz, my mother, gives me Ines' old dresses. She's her favorite. My name is Teresa Wilms. I was born in the sea. Teresa! Do anything! What are you doing? Damn you, damn you! Leave her, Luz leave her I tell you! Scissors! If only I knew what you see when you look at me, mother. I would understand who I am. I think my eyes disturb her. I don't like hers either. What have I told you? Ines found a man that will take her far away. I also want to run away. I want to taste the delicious flavor of the unexpected. I talked to your father. I told him I wanted to marry you. Really? And what did he say? That I only earn 50 pesos a month. But that's enough. We can afford it. That's not all. He told me to forget about you. That I'm a Balmaceda, just a public worker. How are we going to live, and so on. Don't worry, don't worry. Behave, all right? I apologize... You are not a simple girl from the port. I have the same needs as a simple girl from the port I pronounce you husband and wife. Until death do you apart. I swear before God. In this empty church, To love Gustavo Balmaceda until death do us apart. There is no turning back. My parents will never forgive me for running away with Gustavo A new scandal to feed Vina del Mar's society I will never see Teresa again. The Montts have traditions Nobody knows better than a mother When a daughter turns up different. She talks different. She thinks different. Even her gestures are different. Everything in her is strange. Her eyes are lost. Far from us. I have heard her in her sleep. I have heard her curse the day she was born. -Damn her. -Don't say that. Damn her. Be calm. Breathe fast. Grab the bars when I tell you. OK, here we go. Push, push! It's out. It's OK. Relax. These Immigrants! Who do they think they are? To ignore my grandson like that! So complicated. I wonder why didn't Gustavo chose someone less complicated. No, I like Teresa. I think she is bold, challenging. The man, at last, a grandson. -Granddaughter -A little girl, well that's OK too. Congratulations son. Mariano Balmaceda's residence has become our world. Gustavo leaves early every morning to supervise the field labors, And comes back at dawn. Eliza laughing with the frogs. That delicious laughter. Did you know, my love, that frogs are sacred in Egypt? I'm pregnant again. I'm looking forward to it. You shall be named Silvia. My love. My moon face little girl Don Manuel. Come here. Have some wine with me. Thank you, Sir. -The meat is good, Very good -That's the idea, Sir Tell me, what can we expect of the harvest? We have some problems. Sir. So I've been told. Does Mariano know anything about it? No, I didn't tell him yet. Don't. I'll see what we can do. Ok? We have to make an offering to the gods, sir. -Although you have your own goddess. -What are you saying? Don't feel offended, Mr. Gustavo. I don't mean to be disrespectful. You have a blessing. But it could turn into a curse. Keep your wife at home, where you're eyes can see her. Listen to my words. Images invade my mind with no shame. I see unknown things of myself and they shock me. I want to be the other one. The one nobody sees. My need of erotism grows. My fantasies lead me through strange paths. I hunger for sex. I can't tell, nobody would understand. Gustavo! What happened to you, man? Nothing! I fell, damn horse! -What? Where you drunk? -Don't speak nonsense! Here, let me help you. -You let the harvest rot! -Yes, I was going to tell you about it. Yes? When?? When all the fields were lost? -I left you in charge, I trusted you! -Well I did what I could! We will have to start over! We won't be able to grow anything in months! You know that I'm a city man. What was I thinking when I left you in charge? Tell me what to do. Tell him what the hell do you want me to do! We'll see how we deal with it. For now I need you to come with me to Iquique. -What? -To work in Alessandri's senator campaign. What about the fields and the harvest? Let me worry about that, besides there's not much to do right now. We are all leaving. And get changed! Gustavo watches over me jealously. He is different. I suspect he rides by brothels and bars. Something has been lost in him. I don't understand him. And he doesn't understand me. I love that man that never was and waits for me. I love that incomplete man, of just one eye. I love that man that never was and waits for me. Tell me something Teresa. Did you ever thought about writing poetry? What are you doing? Why are you going through my things? -Answer me! -You have no right! o? -No! Listen to me. Here on earth, the only law you have is I. Ok? -Give me my diary, give it to me! -I said no! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Let's get out of here. Let's go to Iquique. Let's go. I want to hide my diaries in the bottom of the ocean We embark course to Iquique. Gustavo says he loves me. Sometimes I believe in what he tells me. So, what do you think of the city? Desolated and beautiful. Like your soul, Teresa. What do you know about me? What your eyes tell me. And something you throw into the sea. Don't let it beat you. The hotel walls are too thin. Come with us tomorrow to the manifestation. It will do you good. It is for an xious spirits, like yours. Cheers. I've met Victor Domingo Silva. His poetry is beautiful. I listen to his pen on paper, he can hear the cries and abuse coming from my room. -Something. -No, this one. -Which one? -This one. Absent. Boredom. An xiety. Tenderness. All of them I feel at once. How? If even in shadow. Your breath haunts me. Since you left. Absent. Boredom. An xiety. Tenderness. In Iquique I feel as free as ever. I talk against religion with Victor, the poet. write for newspapers, visit hospitals, prints and remote towns in the country. Mariano confuses me. He is a freeloader and a womanizer. But he knows how to lure me. And before I know I'm back with him. What did you tell him? Nothing. He found something strange in your eyes. He told me you were falling in love with me. Is it true? Is it true? I give you my love. My life. My passion. My madness. Until the end of times. Or the end of my life. All that surrounds me is soaked in mystery. The furniture talks to itself about tragic secrets. The doors complain about their thresholds. Always waiting for someone that never arrives. And a mute desperation can be guessed in the lamp. You should worry about the house, the family... I worry about the house. I've never left my daughters alone. Teresa, please. I insist. Write, Teresita, write. You have the fire, the passion, the freedom. That, they can never take away from you. You do not only point out the fate of people, but also, that one of dizzy women like myself. I'm so happy to see you! Poet Victor, I introduce you to my friend, Clementina. She has just arrived from Europe. -Charmed. -A pleasure. Well, I'll leave you in the company of your friend. -How was your trip? -I'm exhausted, I just got off the ship and ran here. I promise you, I wouldn't do this for anybody else. Don't lie to me. Don't be mistaken about me, Teresa. -What was that? -What? What else? Him. Well, this place is filled with all kinds of men. Foreigners, Chileans, politicians, journalists, poets, liars. -Oh, vide boheme! -Sort of. The night is to talk, the day to sleep and the afternoon to write. Oh, please tell me. I want to know everything. Who is he? Senator Alessandri. I want to vote in the next elections. Don't you think women should vote? You are absolutely right. Me too. Let's toast to that. The day will come. Poetry will help us, Teresita. Bold, like always. Teresa. Listen to me, Teresa. They never betray their own blood, you must be very careful. It is too late now, Poet. We decided to run away. I will leave Gustavo and take my daughters with me. It is terrible to feel that my love for you is bigger than the love for my daughters. Thank you very much, madam. He is not coming? Can you imagine me living in the country? With the girls? Giving it all up? I know my words are hard. You know who I am, and that I've never pretended to be someone else. I'm just a story in your life. Bitch. How could you, asshole? How could you? Poor idiot. You need this entire circus to fix men problems. What's going on here? Let them fight. Leave them! Cousin -What about Gustavo -I don't know, he wouldn't come in. Well. This is a family court... My father in law knows all of Gustavo's infidelities. He is celebrated. I'm sentenced like a maniac. ...a long discussion about Teresa's affair, and given it's seriousness... We have reached the conclusion... ...that Teresa will be declared disabled. and locked up in convent of The precious Blood. The girls will be left in charge of the Balmaceda's family. That's justice for women. Punished for not following the herd. I want to see my daughters. You lost, Teresa. You lost for sleeping around like a slut. I want to see my daughters! They are mine, I have the right to see them! Dad. Please, I beg you. Let me see them. They are my daughters. After six years in an oak barrel, the truth is that the result is extraordinary. A really unique wine. -I have a surprise for you. -For me? But it's just between the two Vicente! Join us and tell us what you think. -Thank you, but unfortunately I'm been expected. -Don't tell me about it. You are wasting your time in that poetry nonsense again! But my parents expect us for dinner. -Fine, but I'm going to the editorial. -By god! I can never count on you! Please, this can't be. Luisa, you tell him something. Leave him. -How disrespectful of him to leave the Portales waiting. -My son is a creator. He'll soon settle down and take care of the vine like a true Garcia Huidobro. You don't believe in him, that's your problem. I believe in God. Sons are taught, not believe in like idols. Mom! Mom, let me in! Throw them all in, I don't want any left. This box too. -What do you think you're doing? -Straightening your life! -You're crazy! -This nonsense is over! You will not continue to waste your time! You will take over the vine! -But don't you realize that this is my life? -Don't be ridiculous. First you have to earn a living! To be like you? A poor old man, with no dreams or aspirations? I am not like you Mr. Vicente Garcia Huidobro. And I never will be. Go on with your ignorant peasant's life. I will go on with mine. Here is where we are going to live now. When will mom come to this house? Don't worry. We will wait for your father here. OK? I don't know how I will endure this seclusion without my daughters. Without Mariano. Don't write anymore, Teresita. You will get sick. You have confession at 3 o'clock. Is it obligation?? There's a priest that insists on seeing you. I have only ink and paper and the hope that your justice is more powerful than Gustavo's revenge. God, make me strong. What do you have to say, my child? -I have nothing to say. -You are a sinner. You've broken your vow of faithfulness. Now repeat after me. Holy Mother conceived without sin. -Holy Mother conceived without sin. -Almighty Father. -Almighty Father. -Have mercy on this sheep. -Have mercy on this sheep. -Who blinded by the taste of sin. -Who blinded by the taste of sin. -Roves dirty by the cliffs of darkness. -Roves dirty by the cliffs of darkness. -Forgive her. -Forgive her. -Mortify her. -Mortify her. -Sacrifice her. A lamb you are, and into that you shall transform. Are you crazy? Vicente Huidobro. Teresa Wilms. What are you doing here? I came to see the woman that everybody speaks of. The one they call insane. You are a poet, right? I've learned that it is a profession that we share. I don't have anything else in this seclusion. Well, now you have me. Look. This is for you. I rescued it from the fire. We will meet again soon. I promise. Now I leave with God. Take care. I love the original, the strange. I love what people call madness. All love all the sounds of braking chains. -She will be alright. -I'm very grateful, mother. Anyway I would like to pay for her expenses. -You are paying us a lot of money for her care. -Well, she'll be staying here a long time. -How is your wife's health? -Better, a lot better. -Dad! Dad! -This belongs to Teresa. I abuse of veronal until I'm numb. I want to return to the sea. -You look sad. -They are taking everything from me, Vicente. They are going to take my daughters. I will not let anything bad happen to you. I will find the way to get to you. I promise. Just give me time. And promise me you'll be patient. Promise me. The visit is over. Father, I can accept your disdain. That you won't treat me as your daughter. But don't deprive my daughters from their mothers love. Federico. Why haven't you changed yet? We will be late for the theatre. They are my daughters. I beg you to have compassion. Yours always, Teresa. Gustavo? -What's going on now? -What do you mean?? I was told that you were not feeling OK You were told not to get involved with her. But nobody told me she was a liar and a traitor. When do you plan to go back to the office? Tomorrow. Maybe we can work something out in order to annul the marriage. Leave me alone. It what's best for everyone, you could start over... She will be my wife until she dies! I brought you ink and paper so that you can write. Thank you. Next time bring some sweets or chocolate, The only thing that corrupts Sister Soledad is gluttony. We all have our weakness. I need you to speak to my lawyer. He is the only one that can help me with the divorce. Yesterday I received a letter from Gustavo asking me to declare insanity to save the situation. Also my aunt came, speaking for my parents, begging me not to divorce to avoid a scandal. Nobody cares about me! Be calm, Teresa, be calm. Did you learn anything about my daughters? Gustavo will not talk to me. I need to see them! -I can't find Teresa, I've looked everywhere! -Warn Mother Superior, quickly! I will give you a bed with all the breasts of the beautiful women on earth. I want your bitter kisses. Your disturbing caresses. Poor dreamer. You will no long roll on the bed to thank heavens infinite pleasure. You are cold. I brought you something. It is important. I marked some things I want you to read. It is important that you do it. Will you do it? It is important. Vicente will rescue me from this prison. He has promised. He tells me "The poem is the key". The village chapel. From the holy cross. Box. Offering Box, 21 widow. It's urgent. I need to talk to her now. Mother superior can't see you right now. These are not visiting hours... But don't you worry. I'll try to talk to her All right, thank you very much. Good bye. How is this possible? How could it happen?? You are in charge of this! I don't know how it happened, I'm sorry. Ok take it easy, don't worry. Teresa has to return. If not, what kind of a mother would she be? She took two steps forward. Two steps back. She wore a burning shirt. She had eyes that could make the sea sleep. Here I will write myself again. The ink will stain your royal blood, mother. Your blue blood is now red. Red like hell. Like sin. Like revolution. And to those who don't feel the harmony of the free verse. We tell them to re-educate their eros. Their lousy eros. Let the verse be a key, that opens a thousand doors. When you look upon the eyes. Created it is. Good morning. Look what I brought you. Last night you threw your rings out the window. Are you going to throw me out too? If you don't behave, you will go out the window too. That's good to know. -Coffee? -Yes, no sugar. Thank you. Where are you going? For a walk. What about me? Vicente, my soul mate. We are both 22 and we share the same passion for writing. Same family fight. The same scandal that haunts us. Vicente Huidobro. Just Vicente Huidobro. Very often my head dominates my soul. I have more brains than heart, I tell myself. I write to get rid of all feeling. I will run far where no memory or regret can get me. "Sentimental An xieties" I am Horacio Mejias. Are you waiting for someone? -Yes. -And is he jealous? I don't know. Is he going to hit me if he sees me with you? I'm sure he will. You didn't tell me your name. Teresa Wilms. -You are quite insolent. -And your blood pressure is too low. Too much nighttime writing? -Doctor? -Writer? You are the first that calls me like that. I've been looking for you all over the city, like a mad man. -Who is he? -Horacio Mejias. -Let's go. -And this is your lover? Who do you think you are? Let's go Teresa. Leave me something yours. I don't understand. Why did you give him a poem? What do you have to do with him? What's wrong? What happens is that I want to be free. Free from my father. Free from my mother. Free from Manuela. Free from my class. Free from my century. Free from desire. Free from you, Teresa. Two breasts of disturbing whiteness. Two lubricated and drunken eyes. A daring hand of sensuality has crossed my way. I am the erotism. Come. Okay Teresa. We are very happy that you publish with us. We can print a first edition if you agree. Various editorials have shown interest in my work. I'm already known to everyone as a writer. My book will be published. "The three songs". I feel renowned in the only thing I care to do. What do you want? To know you. I'm here to leave a book, I don't have time, doctor. I'll wait for you. "Her lack of manners might be a symptom of a neural disease. Or probably an inherited problem. Although her soul is perverted by absorbed reading with no discipline and with no limits". You should add "Her null respect for God or for any religious subject And her poor morale". But the saddest thing is that even her maternal instincts seemed deformed Absorbed reading perverts her soul. With no discipline and with no limits making her very unfeminine". A fragment of the book "From above" published by Gustavo Balmaceda. Who does he think he is? Putting dirt on Teresa's image like that. Listen "Absorbed reading perverts her soul". -He has pasted posters all over the city! -Teresa did that to herself! This is nothing more than a pathetic demonstration from a broken man. Some situations the only solution is propaganda... I will not allow it, under no circumstance... Don't be absurd! Stop defending what's not defendable! That man is an asshole. But she asked for it! "She reveals an exceptional talent, a deep and colorful harmonic prose from well-rounded periods". Congratulations Miss Teresa Wilms Montt. Thank you. It seems as if luck comes with you. This young doctor Horacio Mejias insists on me. He is beautiful, aristocrat and bohemian. Anuari. Why do you call me that? Anuari is a very big star. Immeasurable. You gave me a name. Baptize me. I baptize you... Let her go! Stop. You lost her. One cannot lose what hasn't been owned or win what is free Let's not waste more time, I will walk you to the door Mr. Mejias. Anuari. Where did you get that from? Some sort of religion?? Teresa's. Yes? Did she baptize you? And how was the ceremony? Intimate. What? You think you're tough? Let go of me. You son of a bitch! Where were you poet? Far. But I am back. Far. And you? I'm right here. I'm far. And you? Right here with you. No, stay there. What are you going to do? In a few minutes the wind will come. When you feel the breeze. I want you to forget you are the most beautiful woman I've ever loved. Forget that your hands write. Forget your daughters. Pure and free running on Chilean fields. Are you going to Santiago? Yes. What am I going to do without you? Get used to goodbyes. Bring me wine. Vicente went back to Manuela and his children. To his mother's unconditional love. He never again spoke to his father I miss him. Do you have desires, Teresa? Yes. You have daughters, Teresa? Are you married? Yes. They are very beautiful. They were taken from me. They took everything from me. Let me return life to you. I can no longer love. Behind this young and passionate seductor, there's an anguished boy. He doesn't understand that I'm half dead. Tired from a tormented life. There ' s only one truth as big as the sun. Death. Marry me Teresa. No. Your body grabbed on to my horror. I wasn't able to see death stalking you. You were a man of secrets. And I never realized it. Poetry and life mixed for ever in your death. What's wrong with you, Gustavo?! I don't get it Dad. What is it? I just received word from the U.S. ambassador telling me that they've detained Teresa in a ship that arrived at New York. She's accused of being a German spy. Are you fucking crazy? How can you use our contacts? Don't you see that you make me look like an idiot? You will explain this absurd situation right now! Where's Teresa? She was deported to Europe. Where the hell is Teresa? Thanks to God, very far from here. Without illusions or philosophy. I run from a black sorrow. As black as one pouring from a recently opened grave. In which I have teared my heart apart. -Say goodbye to your grandmother. -Goodbye grandma. Mother, have you forgiven me? You left before we could talk. Maybe your eyes would have disturbed me. Like mine disturb you. I am Ramon Del Valle Inclan. My soul is an orphan looking for death in each grave. If you can't live without him, bring him back Write, write! My passion is both fatal and untamable. Useless are the secret efforts of my spirit to dominate it. She conquers me. And makes me feel her bite. With all the strength she's made from my heart. They say that I laugh because I'm hysterical. And that I mourn for literature. They say a lot of things about me. Men are surprised to see a woman that drinks, laughs and talks like them. This is not a pleasure trip, son. Understand it. I'm going to work at the embassy Dad, I could be useful, the girls would love to go out, travel. Look Gustavo, I don't want more trouble. And the least I want is to know about your problems with Teresa. Bring the girls. Hurry up, we are going to be late! I am a woman, who has never quenched the hunger for love that devours her. -Your name is? -Sarah, Sarah Hubner As I was saying, I am a writer and a journalist. Yes, Vicente Huidobro told me about you. Tell me about Chile. Is it true they hate me? No, you are respected in intellectual circles. I wouldn't know about the others. Why did you come to Europe, Teresa? -For literature only? -More for karmatic reasons. The absence of your daughters must be difficult. Right? It has compensate me. This life bores me, but any other would have bored me even more. Have you loved a lot? -I have never loved. -Why do you lie to me? I once loved a man that killed himself for me. Who was he? Anuari. -You are not interested in the love of the living? -There's something about love that I like. Spiritually initiating young men that approach me. In those moments I feel above all, motherly. My beloved Teresa. I was told your father in law is the new ambassador in France. Your daughters are coming to Paris. They will arrive for Christmas. Those two bells tolled in my head. Like the announcement of judgment day. The walls drip red paint. I want to live. And in hunger for having it all. I want to die. Vicente's loyalty touches me. You came for me. I was waiting for you. Only he knows all of my secrets. And accepts me with all my rarities. Let my girls little hands cover my tired eyelids and bring peace to my rebellious and adventurous spirit. -They are not here. -Be calm. They will show up. There they are, Teresa. -Thank you, Vicente. -You are welcome. She had hidden a dream inside a dark closet. She had found death inside her head. Hello. Mommy! Let's go? Let's play with mom! Hide! I have loved believing I can reach all what love has for a lifetime -Where does this little goat belong? -Here. Here. Right? And this little donkey? -Where do I put this, my child? -Where ever you want Mama Rosa! How adorable. Are you going to put it there? There's someone at the door, wait here ok? What are you doing here? You thought that if you ran enough, I would forget about everything? Leave, I don't want to listen to you. Whatever you say Mrs. Balmaceda I'll go and I'll take my daughters with me. No! You can't take them! They're also my daughters! What did you do all this time? Tell me what the hell did you do? Take care of your daughters? Sleep with all your lovers? Rosa, take the girls! You will never see them again! Ever again! I swear on their lives. Did you hear me? I will not let you take them! Come on. Get in, quickly. Hurry. All I ever dreamt became a painful reality. I leave my daughters, Eliza and Silvia all my good intentions. It's all I have. And my only treasure This is my diary. This is me. Amazingly naked. A rebel against the system. Big among the little. Little before infinity. It's me...
