I am death. Come with me. Make it shoot, grandpa. Okay buddy, this is it. I'm ready, I'm ready. Don't get excited. Who's excited? I'm not excited. Take it real easy. Remember think ahead. Now be real gentle. Start it slow. Not that slow. Oh grandpa, it's not turning. Stay ahead of it. Pull it back on course. Now you're getting it. Mr. thibadeau, would you turn that thing off? Mr. thibadeau. Mr. thibadeau. Mr. thibadeau, Mr. thibadeau. Where you going, gordie? It's not working, grandpa. I can't stop it. Batteries must be low. Give it here. Dang batteries. No, it's not the batteries. It's gonna crash. It's mayday. Uh oh. Lou. Lou, can you get gordie to band practice? He's real late. Sure, honey. I thought you weren't gonna be playing with that tank anymore. So did Mrs. whitehead. Can you, Lou? I'm real late. Sure thing. Gordie, run up and get your costume. It's not a costume. It's a uniform. Go on, gordie. I'll pick up the tank. Oh gee. And I wish you'd talk to paddie about giving gordie all those donuts. Yes, Meg. And Louis, no more war stories. Yes, Meg. And we're gonna have rattlesnake for dinner. Yes, Meg. Uh huh. Have a nice day, Lou. Bye. Yes, Meg. Mr. thibadeau, what in the name of sweet Jesus is going on around here? We're in deep shit. What did you say, gordie? He said I'm sorry, Mrs. whitehead. I didn't say that, grandpa. Child's a bit hard of hearing. No wonder. He blows that horn all night long and he runs that noisy contraption all over the neighborhood and now he shot a hole in my window. I'm sorry. If this doesn't stop, I'm gonna have to ask you... His eyesight, too, Mrs. whitehead. I gotta take him to a doctor. They think he has weak eyes. Well, well. Who's going to repair my window? I'll take care of everything, Mrs. Whitehead. Don't you worry. I'll be over later. I know you will. I know you will. Goodbye now. Bye, Mrs. whitehead. I think she likes you. Come on, gordie. We're late. Why don't we drive? We need the exercise. What for? So you don't have a heartache before you're 12. That's why I gave up drinking and smoking. Everybody calls you Mr. thibadeau. Is that because of what you did in the war? Nah, it's 'cause I'm old. Gordie, that war is so long ago, nobody even remembers it. Paddie still remembers it. Well, he's old, too. He says you used to go in tunnels after the enemy. He says you're the bravest man he's ever known. What were you doing at paddie's cafe? Eating donuts. Thought you promised you wouldn't eat so many donuts. I didn't have many. I was visiting paddie. He showed me the pictures on the walls of when you and him were soldiers. Donuts are bad for ya. He said you used to fight with a bayonet made of pure ivory. Do you know what ivory is? Elephant's teeth. Well, sort of. Some people think it's very beautiful to see something made of ivory, but you do not make bayonets of ivory. Bayonets are made of case hardened steel, so don't believe everything you hear especially from paddie. Hey, hey, how you doing? Where you going? How you doing? How you doing, paddie? How are ya? How are ya? What's going on? Hey Lou, the apple cobbler's fantastic. You want some? Sure Polly, thanks. Well paddie, how are you on this beautiful sunny morning? Well, I just discovered the stuff we pour on the coffee is flammable. Other than that I'm fine. How 'bout you? Can't complain. Hey, remember that Peterson kid? The quarterback from central when we won the conference? Oh yeah. Yeah, he was just in here. You know he's got bright orange hair? And his girlfriend's got no hair at all. She shaved it off. I mean, what the hell is going on? You want a donut? Ah, all I do is eat these days. All right, I'll save it for gordie. He said he'd been by. Yeah, he's a good looking kid, Louis. Starting to look just like his dad. Yeah, I know. How's Meg? She's fine. The legion is gonna want you to march again in our parade, you know? I wouldn't miss it. You know, gordie's marching this year, too. With his trumpet. Oh boy. Hey Lou, you want that sports magazine? We've been saving it for you in the back. Yeah. I'll get it. No, no, no, no. That's okay. I can use the exercise. You were right about that cobbler. It's to die for. Made it myself. Hey, you're a capricorn, aren't you, Lou? Soaml. I gotta show you our horoscope. Can't wait. You know who general MacArthur was, don't you? Uh huh. The man who was just sitting there was decorated by MacArthur. Where was that? In okinawa. We were there together in '43. One hell of a marine. One time the Japanese caught him putting a charge in a tunnel, you know. Five of them. He killed all five of them with a bayonet. Never said a word. They found the bodies. Yeah, that's his picture there. Yeah, and that's me. Best of group men I've ever known. Yup. You take care now. Thanks. Have a nice day. Yeah, you too. Paddie. Awfully quiet, isn't it, paddie? Oh yeah. You know in 17 minutes the hungry ward from state middle hospital is gonna push through that door screaming for lunch. I'm gonna eat some breakfast. You want something? No. Here. I'm gonna cook you something. You just relax, read the paper. It'll only be a minute. Paddie. Hey Polly, put some eggs on for Lou and me. Nobody here? He's coming right out. I ain't got all day, you know. Oh, he'll just be a minute. I ain't got time for this shit. What you looking at? Is this yours or something? Don't take the donuts. What'd you say? I said put 'em back. Well who are you, fat man? Huh? Is this yours or something, fat man? What do you say, is this yours? These yours? Well, they're not yours. Not mine. Well then why don't you come over here and why don't you just take 'em from me? Why don't you take 'em from me? Come on. Come over here and take 'em from me. Come on. Take 'em from me. Take the donuts from me. Mr. thibadeau, please try to lie still or the doctor can't do his job. Mr. thibadeau, would you like something for the pain? What? Bourbon. Oh, Mr. thibadeau, this is a hospital. What did he say, Warren? He asked for a drink. He's probably dehydrated. Let's give him some fluids orally. Don't go away. I'll be right back. Let's see if we can get you up. How are you feeling, dizzy? I'm fine. Well, we took a fist full of shot out of your throwing arm so you'll be out of the lineup for awhile. We'll give you something for the pain. Thank you. When can I get out of here, doctor? You're free to go right now. We'll get the stitches out next week. No thanks. No? I'll help you get dressed. No, I can manage. You've been very helpful already. What kind of scar is that? Oh, it's a bayonet wound. You haven't missed much in this life, have you? You up for some visitors? Do I have a choice? Dr. Marcus, Dr. Marcus come to surgery. Thanks, doc. Mr. thibadeau, detective isgrow. Allen park police force. This is my partner, detective macombers. How you doing? How you feeling? Fine. I understand they're gonna let you go home. Yeah. Oh, before I ask you any questions. That friend of yours, Mr. blowdow. That guy calls every 15 minutes. He's really concerned about how you are. I told him you're okay. I told him you're on your way home. Yeah. He said you'd been shot before. Long time ago. You know, the other man at the cafe. Do you know him? No. Never seen him before? See the guys that shot him? Yes. How many were there? Two inside, one outside. Think you'll recognize 'em if you see 'em again? Mm hm. Great, great. Well, maybe you come down to the police station. Look at some pictures. I don't know. The spirit is willing, but doc said I shouldn't drive yet. No problem. We'll send a car to get you. If I can help you, I will. Thank you. You know those street gangs are pretty tough. Are you kidding? You're kidding. This guy's tough. Mr. blowdow said that you're a real street guy yourself. You're a war hero. You know what it's like to get wounded. It was a long time ago. Yeah. Thanks a lot. Take care. Dr. resnick, emergency. Dr. resnick. Dr. condose, emergency. Did you get any stitches? How many stitches did you get? Gordie, I asked you to bring the dishes. Your grandfather's gonna be all right. There's no need to ask him a million questions. Did it hurt, all the bullet holes? No, no. Here let me show you. What about the bad guys? What bad guys? The ones who're taking over the neighborhood. Now where'd you hear that? Gordie, go watch TV. That's probably where he heard it. What are you gonna do when you catch 'em, grandpa? Put 'em in jail for the rest of their lives. Why don't you kill 'em? Adios, so long, goodbye, gordie. See you later. Don't watch too much TV. You know we're proud of you, Lou, but we worry about you. I mean, this is supposed to be a time for you to relax. Enjoy your life. Don't worry. You know you worry too much. I'm a fast healer, always was. I'm not talking about that. I mean, look at this. Front page of the newspaper. Meg, if a dog has pups, it's on page one. What's it say? I don't have my glasses. It doesn't say much. Three gunmen, blah blah blah. Eyewitness received superficial wounds. Treated and released. Well they don't say your name. Yeah. I think they're trying to protect you. Oh, I just think it's standard policy, you know. They're protection doesn't really interest me. That's probably them. Wait a second. You said you were gonna stay home today. You promised you were gonna stay home today, Lou. I feel fine. They just want me to go through some pictures. It won't take long. I don't know why you have to do that. I was the only one there. I wanna help. I'll see you later. I don't know if you've thought this through. I have. Nothing at all, huh? Nope. Maybe if you looked a little closer. I don't think so. It'll just take a few more minutes. Not even a vague resemblance? No. I would've said something. Okay. I guess we're wasting our time. Mr. thibadeau, are you absolutely sure that you'll recognize these men if you see them again? I think so. What does that mean, I think so? It means that most likely but not positive. Oh. I only saw them for a few seconds. You know Mr. thibadeau, I think you're having second thoughts. So far, you've described half the men in the city of Los Angeles. I mean, please. We have nothing. Absolutely nothing. Now I just hope you're not having second thoughts about helping us. If I can help you, I will. Look I understand. I understand. If you don't wanna get involved, just tell us. A lot of people are afraid. Not, Mr. thibadeau. I just thought. I just thought that you might be different. None of the men I've seen look like the ones in the cafe, but I could be wrong. It all happened so quick. Okay. Okay. Thanks for coming in, huh. Listen, if there's anything else, we'll let you know. No, no, I'll take a cab. I'm sorry. Yeah. Hello, paddie. Hello, Louis. I didn't know you'd be brought into this. They just wanted me to look at some pictures. I didn't see much. I probably can't help either. Mr. blowdow, detective isgrow. Come on in, have a seat. I don't see how we can get self defense out of this, John. The man had eight bullet holes in his back and I don't think he could've been running backwards. Wait, hold a second. Louis. Let me call you back. Louis. Hey cathryn, how are you? I'm good. How are ya? What are you doing here? Well, looking for someone who fixes traffic tickets. Well it figures I'd run into you. Oh yeah? You got a minute for a cup of coffee or something? No, I was just gonna grab a cab and go home. I had a big day. Well, wait a minute. I got a minute. Let me run you over. Hold on. - Oh good, good. How's your boyfriend? Oh god, don't even bring that up. Hey, I liked him. Where'd you get this speedboat? I earned it the old fashioned way. Jesus, cathryn. Well, so what were you doing at the station? I saw a man get shot yesterday. You too? I'm okay. Well, what did they have you come in for? Well they wanted to see if I could pick someone out of the books. Did you? No. Tell me about the shooting. Well there's not much to say. You know, police said it was some kind of gang thing. I don't know. What happened? Three men came to paddie's cafe and they killed a man. One of them had a tattoo of a skull with a dagger through it right here. Had a gold tooth. I can hardly remember the other two. I couldn't identify anyone. Would you? I don't know. Louis, you gotta be careful. I'm serious. If you testify against one of these gang members, they're just liable to come after you. Well, I think it's over. Well, maybe it is. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna do some snooping around. Promise you won't do anything unless you call me first. Cross my heart. I'm serious. All right, all right. Sound like my daughter in law. I promise. Will the head surgical nurse call the main desk please? Excuse me. Are you the nurse that took care of Louis thibadeau? Yes, we patched him up in emergency yesterday. Are you family? Yes, and I'm his attorney and you did a very good job. He's feeling a lot better. I thought I'd ask a few questions. You know, to see what happened. Well, you should talk to Mr. thibadeau. We're not really supposed to discuss a patient's history. I'm sure you understand. Yes, of course, but uncle Louis is so stoic about these things and you know the police report won't clear for at least a day or two. So, I thought I'd ask. Well, I can't really tell you much anyway. I mean, he's a very lucky man. He was only hit in the arm and that was superficial. You make it sound like there was a lot of gunfire. Oh good heavens, yes. They shot up the whole place with a machine gun. Mr. thibadeau's injury was only buckshot. I didn't realize it was that serious. Well listen, thank you again. You've been a real help. It's my pleasure. And it was a pleasure taking care of Mr. Thibadeau. Rarely see men like him anymore. Thank you. Oh, say hi to your uncle Louis. 1 will. Hey Polly, how are you? Hi, Lou. You okay? Oh sure, thanks. Paddie's out back. Il go get him. Hey paddie, Lou's here. He looks all right. Hey slugger, how you feeling? I felt better. This place is a mess, paddie. What'd you do have a party? Yeah, we cleaned it up the best way we could. Felt kind of strange coming in here. Haven't felt like that in a long time. Isgrow didn't have anything good to say about you. He thinks you're backing off. I told him what he can do with that one. Maybe he's right, paddie. We're not kids anymore. That was 40 years ago. He thinks he knows who the killers are. He might want you to come in there again. I didn't know that. Hey, is that you, cathryn? Yup. You got Miranda duty tonight, huh? Well, we've been waiting for you. Wanna bring those guys on back. The lawyer's here. Which ones? Those space cadets from the planet asshole. Stop being so crude, John. You people never go home? I'm going home in a minute. You must be the reason why they invented TV dinners, huh? No, I'm the reason why they invented the restaurant. Hey, there's three of 'em. You're gonna love these guys. They've been hollering for a lawyer all afternoon. Think you might've seen these guys somewhere before. Think they were on "night of the living dead" or something. Professional zombies. I hear there was a shooting at paddie's. Talk around here is that they're cocaine cowboys. These guys are real animals. They've even killed kids. Are you kidding? Would I kid you, baby? Can't get 'em on anything that sticks. What are you got here, Johnnie? Nothing. Just a simple car theft. I need the file, John. Oh shit, I'll get it for you out front. I'll be just outside. You need anything, just holler and I'll nuke 'em. Okay. Good evening. Do you speak english? Speak english. You speak english? I'm cathryn bolling from the public defenders office. Hey lady, America is okay. Until you are represented by a court appointed attorney. No, no, no court rep, no. We have rights here in America, you know. You know they think that we stole car, but we don't steal no car. Your rights will be. Here's the file, cathryn. He lend it to us. No, no, no, no. Wait okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. You need anything? He lend it to us. Hey. I'll do what I can. He wants to know what you wanna do for him. He don't no do nothing. He no murderer. I do nothing. So why don't you let us go home? You understand? You can't keep us here. It's bolling. I just saw Santos, carrero and Lopez. You're gonna have to take me off of this one. You're gonna need bilingual. I know, yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah, goodbye. Dodgers trailing by a run here in the late innings. The expos sending up a right hander in a pitch hitting role. We'll see if lasorda goes to a lefty. Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing. Wanna see someone from the public defenders office? Yeah sure. Are you detective isgrow? That's me. I'm cathryn bolling. I'm a friend of Louis thibadeau. Oh, do you believe the Dodgers? Listen, nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. Thank you. That's my partner, detective macombers. How do you do? I'm gonna ask a favor of you. Sure. What can I do for you? Please don't bring thibadeau down here again. Excuse me? I'm afraid I don't understand what you're talking about. Your witness has no idea what a cocaine cowboy is. Why haven't you told him? Well frankly, I didn't see what difference it would make. I've known this man all my life and I know you're putting the screws to him and I'm just asking you not to. Listen miss bolling, your friend is supposed to be some kind of war hero, right? Well if he's that kind of guy, he's gonna do the right thing. Now, he saw a murder. He saw a murder and I expect him to identify the man. Now believe me, I'm not asking him to do anything that I wouldn't do or that you wouldn't do. These people are drug dealers. They're killers. And my partner and I risk our lives. We put our asses on the line everyday in the street. I need all the help I can get. Now please, please. Let's not you and me have any problems, okay? Okay? Look, you're a public defender. You defend the criminals. I bust 'em. We'll see each other again. Okay. Say, do you like baseball? Why don't you turn the game on? Oh god, I'm never gonna get out of here. Farley, d.A.'S office. Tom, it's cathryn. Can you check on something for me? There were three males that checked into county today. Yeah, the name of Santos, carrero, and Lopez. Let me see if there's a file on 'em. Hold on. Can you hurry please? Thank you. Cathryn. Yeah. Okay, I got it. Come on, what were they booked on? Let me see. They were initially stopped for exceeding the speed limit. Okay? Five of them in the car. Two of them took off on foot. Car was reported stolen and three were arrested. One has no identification papers of any kind. Mr. zero goes to the feds tomorrow. Thank you very much. And the other two have Florida driver licenses. We're checking those out. If they check, they walk tomorrow. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought you said there was a stolen car. The owner doesn't wanna file a complaint. He's scared. Tom, how long can you hold off? It's a 48 hour clock. It started running at noon. Will you keep them that long? Can you tell me why we should? Tom, would you just do me this favor? Just hold 'em as long as you can. I'll do what I can. All right, thanks. He's not gonna go for it. Would you tell him? He's gonna set someone free who's gonna go out and kill somebody. Would you tell him? Give him my telephone number just in case he changes his mind. Cathryn, hello. Come onin. I know it's early. Oh, it's okay. It's been awhile. Yeah. Is Louis here? I need to speak with him right away. Oh yeah, he's in the backyard with gordie. I'm sorry 'bout what happened. Yeah, well Louis seems to be all right. We're all okay. So I guess we can just forget about it now. I don't think you can. Lou. Well, hello. Hello. This is a surprise. You see this is what happens to you if you study real hard and do all your homework. I don't wanna be a girl. So what are you doing? Fixing my tank. Come on, it's time for you to clean your room before we go, huh. Oh hell. What did you say? What did you say? I didn't say anything. What did he say? - I didn't hear. I didn't hear anything. No, sure. Come on. Meg, I need you to stay here and listen to this, too. Go on, sweetie. Okay. What is it, cathryn? Louis, I've been thinking about this and I think you and Meg should consider leaving the house and the neighborhood. What? Not for long. Why? Louis, isgrow has not been totally honest with you. We don't have to talk about this now. Oh yes we do. Talk about what? About what happened at the cafe. I don't wanna hear it. Well, maybe I wanna hear it. Louis, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into. I know exactly what I'm getting into. Louis, what you saw has nothing to do with a street gang. Oh, come on. What do you want? What you saw was an assassination, Louis. Professional killers. And they have no problems killing people. Dammit, cathryn, you have no business coming out here scaring the wits out of my family. Louis, I have something for you to read. Cathryn. Would you let her talk, Louis? Look at this. Louis. Most of them are illegal aliens and they're part of this drug smuggling ring and they'll kill anybody they want. What do you want? You want me to shake in my shoes? Is that what you want? Did you know about this? I haven't done anything to them. They're not gonna do anything to me. Lou, would you take this seriously? I take it very seriously but I'm not running from anyone. I'm not saying you're running from anyone, Louis. Louis, they kill entire families over drugs. Now what are you gonna do about it? Farley. Farley, it's cathryn. Where do we stand? They're legal. So what? We're letting them out. Come on, hold 'em for me. No. Why not? I can't keep them any longer. 48 hours is the limit. Just give me one reason. I can't tell you anything else. I just I gotta have another day, please. All right. They walk at noon tomorrow. Great. All right, thanks. Allen park police department. Sargent silver. Let me talk to detective isgrow.

I wanted to talk to you about the shooting. All right. Ma'am, I don't mean to be rude, but can it wait until tomorrow morning? No, it's something I wanna talk about now. All right. What do you have to say? Do you have a family, detective isgrow? Ma'am listen, we've been working since six o'clock this morning. We're real tired... I asked if you had a family. Is that a difficult question? No, yeah, I got a family. I do, too. You need my father in law. I need him, too. I want you to leave him alone. I need him to testify. I can understand how you love him very much. He's a very nice man. He's more than that to my son and me. He's all the family we've got. And your coming down here is not making my job very easy. They'll kill him, won't they? Promise me you'll leave him alone. All I can promise you is that I will do everything, everything I can to protect him. That's all I can promise you. Coming through.

Nobody's gonna see you. Go on. Joe. Yeah. This lineup's a bit irregular. Yeah, the courts were asleep. Don't worry, it's gonna fly. It's not gonna make any difference, believe me. I hope so.

That guy's gonna be out on the street in less than a week for a car theft. Maybe even less time than that. That man happens to be a killer. You want him walking the streets, lady? Oh, it's okay if he kills thibadeau as long as you get your testimony first. Is that right? Get her the hell out of here. Damn you. Shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up.

What's the matter, grandpa? I thought that Van. They just wanna know where summer street is. I don't know where it is. Come on, gordie, we're gonna be late. You all right, grandpa? I'm fine, gordie. I just thought that. Go 'head with your mother. See ya, grandpa. Bye Lou. Mr. thibadeau. Mr. thibadeau. Mr. thibadeau. What in the hell was that? Sounded like a gun. Was it you, Mr. thibadeau? I thought it came from over there. Listen to me, Mr. thibadeau. We know what you've been going through, but there's no call to be firing guns around the neighborhood. Now, we're all with you. Heavens, we've all helped each other in the past. If you ever need anything, you know we're all here. But Lou, this is a quiet neighborhood. There's no reason to be running around with guns. I'm sure that you're right, Mrs. Whitehead. Well, all right. If you need anything, you just call. Come on, sweet pea. You get to go home now. Wanna put a car on thibadeau's house? I don't know. They don't know where to find him and we don't wanna send up any flags. No, no. No car. Wanna get some lunch or something? Some Chinese food? No thanks. What you gonna do? Stand in the window and look at him all day? Hey, let's get some of that duck you like. It'll make you feel better. You go ahead. Just bring me something back. I was talking to isgrow. You better be a little careful. I'll be all right. I don't know if I would've done that. Well, it's too late now, isn't it? If you need anything, call me, all right? You call me. I'm proud of you, Lou. Polly, bring Lou a piece of pie, will ya. Got it. See ya, paddie. Goodnight, Polly. Goodnight. Goodnight. Thanks for sticking out with us, Polly. That's okay, but be careful, paddie. Okay. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. Get out of here. You get out of here. This is my house. You get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Don't talk to me like that. Somebody get that. I'll get it. Hello. Hello. Lou. What? I can't hear you. Lou. Who's this? Who's this? What is it, gordie? I think we got a prank, grandpa. All right, hold on a moment. Who is this? What'd they say? I don't know. Hello, can I help you with anything? Lou. Hello? Louis. What? Watch out. Paddie? Gordie. You all right? Are you sure? Mr. thibadeau, we'll be keeping a car across the street. Thank you. They're on their way right now. All right. What's gonna happen now, grandpa? I don't know, gordie. We're leaving, Louis. Gordie and I are leaving. I'm getting him out of here. Gordie, I put some clothes and stuff in a bag for you, sweetheart. Go upstairs and see if there's anything else you want. We're just gonna go for a little while, honey. Go ahead. Grandpa. Go 'head, gordie. Meg. I'm sorry. You're sorry? He could've been killed. What have you been thinking? We could all be dead. Will you look at that, Louis? Why? I don't know why, Meg. I don't know how to explain it to you. It's just something I had to do. I never thought that. God. Will you go with us, Louis? Please, will you go with us? Meg. This is my house. Damn you. Why'd they shoot at us, grandpa? They're trying to make us afraid, gordie. Are you afraid of them, grandpa? I don't think so. How's he doing? Well, they really beat him up pretty badly, but he'll pull through. He's a tough old goat. Yeah. I am worried though, Mr. thibadeau. He seems very depressed. Oh, not about his injuries, but he's told me quite a bit about the war and the two of you. I don't think I follow you. He feels he's betrayed you, Mr. Thibadeau. He's telling everyone he doesn't deserve to live. Talk to him. I understand. Where in here? Right here. Hello, paddie. Louis. Boys from legion called me. They're all rooting for you. They'll be over soon as they can. I'm sorry, paddie. I'm goddamn sorry. I don't know what to say. I'm just goddamn sorry. I told them everything, Louis. Your name, your address. Your friend couldn't keep his mouth shut. I didn't wanna tell them but I couldn't help it. It's not you, paddie. You did fine. We're all proud of ya. I'm afraid I let you down, paddie. I owe you, paddie, and I won't forget. You gotta leave. They want ya. Sh, sh, sh. They didn't kill me because they want you. I know. I know. So why didn't you call? I had to hear things from isgrow. Where's Meg and gordie? They left last night. They're in long beach at a friend of Meg's. What about that patrol car they assigned you? Where are they? It's out there. Sometimes they drive around the block. So what are you gonna do? Well, I don't think I'm gonna leave if that's what you came here to ask me. So you're just gonna sit here and feel sorry for yourself? Is that your plan? I don't expect you to understand, cathryn. Then that means you're gonna stay. Yes. Well then, so am I. What do you mean? Well, if you're gonna stay, I'm gonna stay. You can't stay. Why not? You can't stay. Then throw me out. Louis, come on, sit down. Oh Christ. Lou, I've known you all my life. I've looked up to you. Because of you, I am what I am today. I put everything out on the line for you. Now if you stay here, they're gonna kill you. What about Meg and gordie? Have you thought about what they would've done if you weren't here? I've thought all about this. I just don't know what to do about it. Maybe I thought I was someone else. Now in the war, I was decorated by general MacArthur. It's funny how you remember some things. I remember him watching out in front of the formation in Manila. We were all standing in the rain. A couple of thousand of us. He stopped right in front of me. I was 19. You know what he said? God bless you, Mr. thibadeau. You make me proud to be an American. I almost cried. You know I tried to do this right and I've done it all wrong. It's over, Lou. It's over. I know. Things are not as clear as they used to be. Detective isgrow, please. Isgrow? Louis thibadeau. No, no, no, no, everything's fine. Very quiet. I appreciate that. Look, I don't think you need 'em anymore. Well, I'm gonna be with my daughter in law and grandson and some friends of hers. I think it's better if I waited out there. Yeah, I know, yeah. So you can whistle your boys back in. Yeah, all right. Uh huh. Thank you. Goodbye. I'm gonna go upstairs and pack a few things and then we'll get out of here. Did you lock up? Mm hm. The windows closed? Yup. So, I'll see you when I get back, all right? You still like that Mexican restaurant? Yeah, yeah. I haven't been there in a long time. Yeah, I'd like to go there. Oh, are you leaving, Mr. thibadeau? Yes, I am, Mrs. whitehead. Oh, I'm so sorry for you and Meg and little gordie. Yeah. But you're doing the right thing. Yeah right. Heavens who knows what might happen next and we can't have this kind of thing happening around the neighborhood. Yeah. And think of your family. I'm sure you'll agree. Yes, you're right, Mrs. whitehead. Come on, Lou, we gotta go. Right. Good luck, Mr. thibadeau. Thank you. And we'll look after your house for you while you're gone. Appreciate that. Everybody loves you, Lou. Cathryn, I wanna thank you for everything. This will all be over very soon. You know what, Lou? She was right. You are doing the right thing. Now you take care, okay? You too. Be good. I'll call you from long beach. Now get out of here. Okay. Hey, can I help you? I'm looking for someone. The hell you want, huh? I am death. Come with me. Come with me. I am death. Hello. Meg. Yes. It's cathryn. I thought I'd call and see how you guys were doing. We're fine. How's Louis? Louis isn't here. Where is he? I don't know. He didn't call here today. We haven't talked to him. He went back. What? I'm gonna try to call him and then I'll call you back, okay? Cathryn. No, don't touch. No, don't touch. Put the gun down. Put it down. Get on your knees. Shit. Shit. Oh shit. Operator, give me the police. Run, cathryn, run. Ah. Louis is inside. Don't shoot. Hostage in the house. Hold position. Gordie, wait. Everybody hold it. Nobody move. Hold your fire. Hold your position. I'll check the house. 1 got ya, I got ya. Easy, easy. Just sit down here, okay. How you doing? Okay, I'm gonna take the knife. It's okay. It's okay. I'll be right back. I'm gonna get the doctor. Now don't move. Grandpa. You okay? Oh my god. It's over, gordie. Meg, I'm sorry. Lou, it's okay. Cathryn, I had to do it. I had to. I know, Lou. I know, but it's okay. It's okay now. He shot me. He shot me. We should get him to a hospital. Okay. Okay, Mr. thibadeau, we're gonna get you up. Ready? One, two, three. Easy, easy. Here we go. Come on, Mr. thibadeau. It's all right. Okay. It's okay. No, no, no. I don't wanna lay down. I may not get up. Let me walk. I'll walk with you. Let's go. It's all right, it's all right. Let me ask you, what's his name? Everything's gonna be all right, Mr. thibadeau.
