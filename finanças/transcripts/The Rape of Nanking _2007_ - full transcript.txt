One of the greatest atrocities of world history is the Rape of Nanking. FOLLOWS - moviesbyrizzo editors caveat> All human beings are capable of committing these kinds of atrocities - not just the Japanese or the Germans. I think all human beings have this capacity for great evil if put under the right social and political circumstances. The Rape of Nanking, was something that always could happen, and it did happen, and we have to learn from history if we want to make sure it doesn't happen again. And now a news update. Early this morning the body of writer and human rights activist Iris Chang was discovered in her parked car off the interstate highway near San Jose, California. The 36-year-old author was best known for her book, 'The Rape of Nanking', which described the mass slaughter of Chinese civilians by the Japanese Imperial Army in 1937. The internationally acclaimed best-seller was the first major work in English about the massacre. Chang, who had been suffering from depression, died of a gunshot wound, the victim of an apparent suicide. MUSIC I grew up hearing stories about Japan invading China and Chinese people being massacred by Japanese soldiers in Nanking, but I didn't know all the details. I had just finished writing my first book and Nanking was one of the topics I was considering for the next. Then some friends of mine told me about this conference on the Rape of Nanking that was being put together by a group of Chinese activists. So I drove up from Santa Barbara where I was living at the time, to Cupertino to see what I could find out. At that time, I really didn't know if there was enough for a book there. Japan's post-war prosperity ended with the Great Depression. Unemployment soared, millions were thrust into poverty. Japan's military leaders believed expansion into China, with its vast resources, was the solution to the country's problems. The economic crisis gave them the opportunity they had been waiting for. In 1931 they struck. EXPLOSION Japanese troops seized control of Manchuria, a huge area of Northwest China. Over the next few years they marched east, then south, conquering provinces one by one. China was in no position to put up much resistance. The nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek was embroiled in a vicious civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and was preoccupied with its own survival. But, by 1936, with the survival of the country itself at stake, the two sides formed an uneasy alliance to confront the Japanese invaders. Full-scale war was inevitable. It came in the summer of 1937. A minor clash near Beijing was trumped up by the Japanese. It was the excuse they'd been looking for. They captured Beijing and, in August, attacked Shanghai. EXPLOSION SCREAMING In November, after a fierce three-month battle, the city fell. MUSIC The Japanese army then marched on the capital city of Nanking, laying waste to everything in its path. As refugees and retreating Chinese soldiers streamed towards Nanking, Japanese bombers terrorized the inhabitants of the city with daily air raids. By December 12th Japanese troops were massed outside the walled city of Nanking. The next day, they entered the city and began raping and murdering its citizens in an orgy of violence that has few parallels in modern history. My parents were the ones who told me about the Nanking Massacre when I was a little girl growing up in a Midwestern college town. My parents are science professors and they're very talkative, and always told me what it was like for them to grow up during the war in China. Their parents -- my grandparents-- barely escaped with their lives. When the Japanese invaded Shanghai, my father's father was the mayor of one of the suburbs there. He quickly sent his family away to safety, but it was his duty to stay behind to help defend the city. So he cannot go and it is my mother who has to bring all four children to safety. There's no water, there's no food, and the train was loaded. EXPLOSION The Battle of Shanghai lasted three months. That was very hard for my mother. She was very worried and the city was cut off. There was three months there was no news between my mother and my father. My mother's father worked for the Nationalist Government in Nanking and had already sent his family to a safer area. Then, in the middle of November '37, Chiang Kai-shek decided to move the government headquarters inland. My grandfather and other officials were ordered to evacuate immediately... with or without their families. My mother was visiting her mother, so he sent a message to my mother in the village to ask her to come to WuHu Institute Nanking. This is about four days because the ship going to leave. And he went to the dock of the WuHu everyday to check the arrival of my mother with her one-year-old, and there's no sight of her. Finally he was left with this choice of either leaving the area, taking that last ship from Nanking and perhaps never seeing his family again, or waiting and perhaps never seeing her anyway, and then run the risk of being massacred by the Japanese. It was a horrible choice that no man should ever make. And finally, as he was about to leave because the ship really was on its way out of the region, he cried out her name and just screamed it to the heavens. "Yipei! Yipei!" - that's my mother's name. And, uh, there's a miracle. On the corner of the Yangtze River there's a... ...the last sampan come towards the WuHu, and there's my mother sticking her head and saying, "I'm here!" My mother was on the boat! Some of the stories --war stories -- would filter down to me when I was a little girl growing up in Champagne-Urbana, Illinois. And my mother and father said that the Rape of Nanking had been so intense that thousands upon thousands of people were killed and the bodies that had been thrown into the Yangtze River during the carnage literally made the water turn red. MUSIC When I was a little girl I had nightmares sometimes. The stories were very, very disturbing. I remember there was one I had over and over where I was in a white dress, being chased by a Japanese soldier. BREATHING HEAVILY And I remember as a child wanting to learn more about this, and after going to my local school libraries, public libraries, I couldn't find a word about this matter in English. So the matter really remained a mystery to me for years. MUSIC When I saw the photographs at Cupertino, it was like finally coming face-to-face with the horrors my parents had told me about. And if anything, it was worse than they had said. There was this one picture of, a man who had just been decapitated. His head was still sitting on his neck. MUSIC HEAVY BREATHING Basically, in a single blinding moment I saw the fragility of human life... and that's when I knew I had to write this book. It was like I had no choice. I also felt that had I been born in another era, in another country, in another time, I could have easily been one of those corpses, one of those anonymous corpses in a photograph. And the idea that perhaps half a century later no one would care and that the perpetrators... might even say that it never happened at all; that was just horrifying for me. MUSIC This is where it all started, right in that room behind me. I saw this young girl with a ponytail, slender, quite tall for a... for a Chinese-American. Excuse me, I was looking at those pictures. They're devastating and I would really like to borrow them to make some copies. I said, "What are you gonna do with it?" Oh, just for my records. I said, "For what?" I'm a professional writer. Oh, yeah, I said, "Yeah, right." Because she looks so young I thought she was a high school kid writing a book report. I said, "Well, this is the kind of subject you don't even want to touch." She was intense, she was focused, she was driven and she was a go-getter, and I knew that the first moment I saw her. She looked at me in the eyes and says, "I'm gonna get it done," and without saying it, I know that was a promise. So the next morning we came back, we started to go through things we wanted to do and how we're going to support it. She said, "I need your help. I don't know anybody in Nanking, but I figure that's where I'm gonna go. So I need you to help me to find leads." Really? Your family is from that area? Like Humphrey Bogart said, "It's the beginning of a good friendship, a beautiful friendship." Having the people in Cupertino behind me was a huge break, but at the same time I also felt very overwhelmed because I had a lot of people counting on me. So one of the first things I did was call Susan Rabiner, my editor. I had worked with her on my first book, Thread of the Silkworm. And she said, "I'm wondering if Basic would agree if I paid for it, to do a book that I want to do that's very important to my community?" I said, "We don't work that way. We're not going take money from you. Either we're going to believe in the book and publish it, or we're not going to publish it. So tell me more about the topic." And she described the story of the Rape of Nanking. I was fascinated. My entire career in publishing had been related to doing serious non-fiction books by academics. Here was an enormous topic of great importance and yet not one academic, it appeared, had written about it. I think there's a big question to be asked and answered. Why did it need a child of the community to tell this story? And second, why had it disappeared from the history books? She talked to people in the United States who had been there in Nanking at that time. She spent a lot of time in the National Archives in Washington DC, and also a lot of the people in Nanking were missionaries who had been - who were from Yale, and their records were in the Yale archives. The first question we were asking is -- what happened? -- because the Japanese claimed one thing, the Chinese claimed something else. So by then we knew we wanted to tell the story Rashomon (psychological thriller movie) style -- three different ways. The first way would be from the perspective of the -- the attackers, the Japanese, as they remembered the incident. The second time would be from the perspective of the victims, the Chinese, as they remembered the incident. But the critical factor was, were there independent people there who could either verify the Japanese side, or the Chinese side? So very early on we were focused on the independents. When I started researching I was surprised to find out that the Rape of Nanking was front-page news at the time. Western journalists were actually living in the city when the Japanese invaded. They saw what happened with their own eyes and their reports about the massacre were sent around the world. About 20 other Westerners stayed in Nanking as well, businessmen, missionaries, diplomats, and doctors, and many of them wrote detailed diaries documenting the atrocities. MUSIC John McGee, an American missionary, even filmed the victims; and when I saw his footage I couldn't believe how brutal the Japanese soldiers had been. Dr. Robert Wilson worked day and night treating horrifying wounds. Then there was Minnie Vautrin. She turned her women's college into a refugee camp. And German businessman, John Rabe, hid hundreds of people in his own house. He was one of the foreigners who stayed in the city to create a 2 and a half square-mile area, which they called the Safety Zone. And they protected hundreds of thousands of Chinese from slaughter during the worst of this massacre. Wilhelmina Vautrin, or Minnie Vautrin as her friends called her, was a missionary who grew up in Secor, Illinois. And in 1937, she was the head of Jinling Woman's College in Nanking. When Nanking fell to the Japanese, Vautrin turned the campus into a refugee camp. Thousands of Chinese women and children poured into the zone with only the clothes on their backs. Soldiers would break into the camps at night, and kidnap a few women before Vautrin and the other missionaries could stop them. Vautrin managed to rescue a few girls from the clutches of soldiers and ordered the Japanese out of the zone. But these men were not accustomed to dealing with strong women like Minnie Vautrin and slapped her around or threatened her with their bloodied swords, bayonets, and guns. MUSIC Minnie Vautrin was a strong woman and a hero, but in the end, she found it impossible to sustain the mental torture of living in the hell that was Nanking; because shortly after the massacre, she suffered a nervous breakdown and had to return to the United States. She never recovered. Vautrin one day stopped up the cracks of the house, turned on the gas, and committed suicide. Minnie's testimony really made a profound impression on Iris and the fact after... that after having lived through this and actually playing such a significant role in saving so many of the Chinese in Nanking, that she was so tormented that she committed suicide later, you know, that was something that, you know, it didn't let go of Iris's mind. From 8:30 this morning until 8:00 this evening I stood at the front gate while the refugees poured in. I've heard scores of heart breaking stories of girls... who were taken from their homes last night. Tonight a truck passed in which there were eight or ten girls... and as they passed they called out, "Jiu Ming! Jiu Ming!... Save our lives!" Oh, God, control the beastliness of the soldiers in Nanking tonight and comfort the heartbroken mothers and fathers whose innocent sons have been shot today. And guard... guard the young men and girls through the long, agonizing hours of this night. How ashamed the women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror. SNIFF MUSIC And then she said, "I read the diary, I was crying, I was broke down right there." And she's crying. She said... she really told me, "If I finish the Rape of Nanking, I'm going to publish this diary." But she never had the chance to do that. But she didn't have any chance. I'll dedicate my life to get your stories told I'll give voice to the voiceless silenced for too long... Crying out for justice silenced for too long, trust me with your pain I'll take it as my own. I'll fight to get the truth told my weapon is my word. MUSIC She flew into Hong Kong and she was gonna take a train up to Nanking, and she thought she was gonna get to sort of be a tourist for a few days. It was like a steam locomotive, there wasn't air conditioning in the car, and it was very, very crowded and she got sick on that train ride, and she was sick her whole time she was in China after that. I went to China in the summer of 1995 and I interviewed about a dozen survivors. There are still several hundred people in China who remember the atrocities vividly, who lived through them. This is why I wanted to write the book so quickly and get it done. I really felt an urgency here. I was afraid that if I waited too long that all the voices from the Rape of Nanking would be extinguished forever from old age. Taxi! She has already been to China in '93 to do research on "Thread of the Silkworm", so she was comfortable getting around in China. HONKING This is it. MUSIC The Global Alliance hooked her up with the right people people in China, and so she talked to them a lot over the phone and by e-mail and regular mail in advance and got everything well lined up before she went. She just went straight to the people she wanted to talk to and she didn't really try to make a big deal about the fact that she was there, you know, digging up information. I think she was definitely under the radar the whole time she was there. My friend Professor Sun Zhai Wei called me saying that a writer in America wanted to come here to write a book about the Nanjing Massacre I had my doubts in the beginning because she was too young But having worked together for a while I found that she was very good very professional She looked like a university student when she first came I asked her "Why did you think to write such a book?" And she replied "The Nazis massacring the Jews was something the whole world was familiar with But in America in the West the history of Japanese soldiers massacring Nanjing civilians this was something that very few people knew about She said "Being a Chinese descendent I have a responsibility to write this book" When I heard this speech of hers I was incredibly touched The three of us split up our work Teacher Duan was responsible for contacting the survivors and to accompany Miss Chang to go and meet them This job would be done in the daytime Professor Yang was Iris Chang's translator During the interview with the survivors Professor Yang was the translator As for me I would be in the library in the Archival Files Library collecting together facts and figures It was in 1995 that I first met Iris Chang when she came to my house to interview me my home was still in the same house where the massacre happened She asked about the massacre first She asked how my family died how I lost my relatives There were 9 of us in the family and four people from the neighbouring home A total of 13 people all hiding I told her that 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers lifted up their guns and there was a white flag with a red spot on it It's an old house a house of the past These were all demolished all demolished This was my home When they came in they shot and killed my father My mother was holding a child They grabbed the child and smashed the baby to death They ripped off my mother's clothing Then the Japanese rushed into our bedroom My grandma and grandpa were sitting on the edge of the bed protecting us we were four girls lying on the bed There was a quilt covering us My grandpa and grandma would not move away and so one was killed on this side the other was killed on that side Then I cried out loud And I was stabbed three times A stab here a stab here and one at the back Then I lost consciousness In the evening of December 12th the Chinese army that was guarding the gate received orders to retreat And so under the night's disguise they retreated towards Xia Guan The Japanese army did not know Chinese troops had retreated So from about 100 meters from here initiated their first attacks By December 13th at 3AM in the morning the Japanese army had seized the gate Chiang Kai-shek had abandoned his capital. Government officials and the entire Chinese Air Force had been ordered to leave. The remaining Chinese defenders with no air support and poor communications were trapped on the southern bank of the river and inside the city walls. They had no choice but to surrender. The Japanese sent troops into the city to search and arrest the unarmed Chinese soldiers Some Chinese soldiers had nowhere to retreat to stripped off their uniforms and put on civilian clothing They then hid in the safety zone The city is strangely silent. Three dangers are past - that of looting Chinese soldiers, bombing from aeroplanes, and shelling from big guns. But the fourth is still before us - our fate at the hands of a victorious army. People do not know what to expect. They found out soon enough. From the moment they entered the city, Japanese troops engaged in a campaign of murder, rape, looting and arson that was so barbaric a British reporter actually compared them to Attila and the Huns. MUSIC During the first few days, the Japanese army killed tens of thousands of defenceless Chinese prisoners of war. It's hard to believe it was all done out in the open, in full view, without shame. I think they were actually trying to kill almost any man of military age in the city, it wasn't just soldiers. There were a lot of people who were rickshaw pullers, you know, police officers, coolies who looked like soldiers, but they weren't, and they slaughtered males in the city indiscriminately. They killed tens of thousands of men in the city during those first few days. And even the Japanese reporters were shocked by the brutal behaviour of their soldiers. On December 13th, I saw a mass killing of POWs. The prisoners were lined up atop the wall. Then Japanese soldiers stabbed them in the chest and abdomen. One by one, the prisoners fell down to the outside of the wall. Blood splattered everywhere. The chilling atmosphere made one's hair stand on end and limbs tremble with fear. Literally we are a research team consisting of scholars lawyers journalists and labourers like myself and our activity focuses on the Nanjing massacre We started in 1988 and interviewed about 200 veterans Words cannot describe the feeling of climbing up the mountain of dead bodies and stabbing them" There were elderly and even children We killed every one of them" This is an excerpt from General Nakajima Kesago's diary dated December 13th, 1937: "To comply with the policy of not keeping prisoners, we decided to dispose of them all but it's very difficult to find ditches huge enough to dispose of 7,000 or 8,000 people." The first mass execution was conducted in the Chinese Navy facility on the Yangtze River This was like an experiment for the coming mass executions They concluded that the execution was successful which resulted in an even bigger scale of mass execution on the 17th killing over 10 000 people They shot dead bodies with heavy machine guns over and over again Then they poured gasoline over them and set the fire Jiandong Gate, 10,000 killed; Swallow cliff, 50,000; Straw Gorge, 57,000; Coal Harbour, 3,000; Torpedo Barracks, 9,000; Jang-shung Wharf, 10,000... She was in the dark, imagine how the victim will feel, and just try to internalise the stories she heard each day. And during the night, she was actually sitting in a room surrounded by the pictures, she couldn't see, the maps on the wall, and try to imagine she was there. It could be said that at that time Nanjing was in a cloud of darkness Japanese soldiers did whatever they wished within Nanjing They killed citizens at will raped women as they pleased When the Japanese came I was only nine years old I looked quite pretty then They would take away 3 or 4 kids at one time young girls The Japanese would take them into the hay shed and for a long time they would not come out Then we'd hear little girls screaming and crying But we didn't understand what was happening They would rape 3 or 4 of them at a time and then more Japanese came and they would rape more What they did to the women was far worse than what they did to the men. They raped an estimated 20,000 to 80,000 Chinese women. That was the single greatest mass rape of world history up to that moment. They would rape great grandmothers over the ages of 80, young children under the ages of 8. They often turned rape into sport. Of course soldiers did more than just rape women. They violated them with rods, bayonets, twigs, golf sticks, even fire crackers. They always killed burned raped gang raped and looted Senior soldiers were holding the arms and legs of a woman trying to see how deep her vagina was One of them pushed a pole into her vagina trying to see how deep it would go The woman cried and struggled but soldiers were holding her down She was helpless After the pole reached to the end the soldier put cotton into her vagina poured in gasoline and set it on fire to burn her to death This was commonly done by soldiers this was a method employed by those who killed women? One survivor told me that he saw a soldier pry open the legs of a little girl, of about nine or ten, in the street and violate her in front of crowds of pedestrians before splitting her head in two with a sword. After I woke up I crawled over my grandparents' bodies and slowly made it outside When I saw my sister she no longer had any clothes on They were all torn off no pants no clothes My second eldest sister laid on the bed with no clothes on either Outside the room I saw my dead mother with no clothes on Another one of my little sisters was also dead in the courtyard Our four neighbours were all dead as well Finally when I came to all Japanese had left There are about 20 of them? Yes 20 Finally, when I came to, all Japanese had left. - There are about 20 of them? - Yes, 20. And, uh, I found my... older sister lying on the table. - How old was she? - About 15 years old. without any clothes on and with blood beside her. - Had she been raped? - Yes. And another sister was lying dead on the bed, also without any clothes on. - How old was she? - And, uh, 14 years old. Both of them were dead. A few foreigners came to my house to take pictures They took many many pictures it was the American who took pictures At that time in year 1937 I was in so much sorrow and from then on my tears would not dry from then on my tears would not stop My two elder sisters were raped by them they were tortured to death At that time I was in such grief so much sorrow After the Japanese arm invaded Nanjing They forced approximately 20,000 Chinese women into acts of sexual violence After sexual disease proliferated within the Japanese army the Japanese government decided to establish "comfort centers" Of these some were seized by force some were deceived and tricked The youngest were only 14 or 15 years old According to the testimonies of these women they had to in one day service at least four to six Japanese soldiers The prettier ones would sometimes have to serve 10 to 20 Japanese soldiers I found an old woman named Lei Gui Ying who was tricked into a Japanese army's comfort centre There was a Japanese woman thought I was going to look after her baby One time the Japanese came looking for comfort women but there were no women around I was about 15 or 16 years old then so the Japanese woman made me take their place She couldn't find anyone so she grabbed me They pinned me down on the bed and then forced me to sleep with them I resisted but it was useless I was small I couldn't fight them off In that Japanese place I was ravaged That was the situation She could get extremely involved, she could visualize things very well. It was so much about others, about wanting to put herself in other people's shoes and really understand situations and people... intellectually and also on an emotional level. I felt like a time traveller at times because... here would be somebody who had fought off, let's say, three men who tried to rape her and I saw pictures of her, you know, slashed up with bayonet wounds, and somebody who at that time was only 19 years old. And, when I actually met this woman 60 years later, I found her, you know, this feisty old woman, who was telling me exactly what I had just read a few weeks earlier in the archives. It was... it was just terribly moving for me... I suddenly felt that this is not something that just... affected people 60 years ago, the massacre affects people today... still. In 1937 the Japanese Imperial Army invaded China I was nine years old I had 3 older sisters and 3 younger brothers My youngest brother was only a year old Our whole family lived inside a wooden boat so we could hide from the turmoil of war But before we could reach the countryside the boat sank My father brought us to the marshes to hide My father took my sisters to hide in one place while my mother took me and my brothers to hide somewhere else My baby brother started to cry Why did he cry He needed to get milk from my morn The Japanese Imperial Army soldiers found my mother And they wanted to rape my mother My mother resisted She fought back still carrying my little brother carrying my one-year-old brother Those Japanese soldiers snatched my brother from my mother and smashed him to death on the ground As soon as my mother rushed over the Japanese soldiers grabbed their guns and fired off two shots at my mother My mother was shot to death right there two days later they discovered my father and captured him My father was taken away by them in 1937 He never came back Two days after they took away my father they saw my second eldest sister after they spotted her they snatched her and wanted to rape her My sister resisted she tried to fight them off one soldier drew out his long sword and butchered my thirteen-year-old sister After he slashed her we saw my sister's corpse Her head had been chopped into two halves From then on it was just me and my fifth brother The two of us We cried every day What struck me was, not only did these survivors have to live with these terrible, physical and psychic scars, but most of them were dirt poor. Poverty-stricken beyond belief. They were crammed into these tiny rooms. They had nothing. Just a little child They took it all away your blood, your life your trust, your faith Red, as the river, looming large the gate, darkness in your heart I'll dedicate my life to get your stories told. I'll give voice to the voiceless, silenced for too long. Crying out for justice, silenced for too long. Trust me with your pain I'll take it as my own I'll fight to get the truth told My weapon is my word. All these stones, thousands and thousands of them representing the victims. When I close my eyes I can almost hear their screams. When I think back and I saw her to the taxi I never would have thought it would be our final farewell Such a great regret She immersed herself in this history It was as if she saw herself within this history and actively used her feelings to experience Her book was not written with a pen It was written with her heart Yeah - oh... No, nothing... I have to go because I woke up late today... Yeah, yeah, yeah... Okay, okay. Okay, bye. TYPING We met each other in a writer's group. Her book, the "Thread of the Silkworm", was about to come out and, she was very excited about that. We just hit it off right away. She was, even at that point, very, very intense and just interested in everything. Always asking questions. For her, nothing was impossible. If there was an obstacle, it was a challenge. It was something to be overcome, and maybe something that even represented an opportunity potentially. If the door was closed, she would climb in the window. When she was in the book mode, she would just stay focused on something forever. I mean, she would just get up at 12 noon, work till 3 or 4 in the morning, and start the whole thing over the next day. TYPING In the beginning, she really was very happy to get the story out. And those survivors really trusted her very, very much. So she really did not want to fail them. My father went to wash vegetables was seen by the Japanese soldiers They fired three shots and killed my father He fell to the ground My mother heard She came out to look for him and was hit by a gunshot too Mama died too She died in my father's arms I was just eleven years old I heard my mother die and ran out to look I saw a pool of blood on the ground Their bodies were all covered with blood Before I could cry out for my father the Japanese soldiers shot me once This arm was hit the bone was broken My body was burning with blisters Under my armpit all that was left of my clothes were strips Blood was coming out of my mouth I was in between life and death My grandfather was beaten his head split open even the blood from his actual brain seemed to gush out They found my aunt She was seven months pregnant They dragged her out to rape her My poor aunt begged them to have mercy But no kept dragging My aunt cried out "Help me!" And auntie was then gang-raped by them by the five of them That night she started to hemorrhage The baby went with each drop of blood and so the baby died My aunt burned with a high fever that night She died too Two of the Japanese soldiers lifted their rifles and grouped all of us together They picked people out of the group with their rifles The people they picked were all the elderly the women and the children I was one of the children Then young men were taken away The next day everyone was out in the streets Asking each other the same question 'Has your son returned yet?" or"Has your husband returned yet?" That's what they asked each other But nobody knew They had the no answers Nobody returned home By the pond the dead were sprawled everywhere All dead people Their hands were tied at the back chained together And they were kneeling This was so when the soldiers shot them in the back They would fall on each other They were not able to run and jump in the river We arrived at East Gate Riverside Bridge? which had been destroyed by the bombing It was winter time and the water was shallow How were we going to cross the river? This was the only way to get to Shang Xin River We had to cross the river Then we saw that there was a huge amount of bodies in the river forming a path to cross the river I believe this was created by the Japanese as they forced groups of Chinese people there and made this 'path' Wooden boards were laid on top of the corpses and I walked across the river with my grandmother On both sides all you could see were heads and fee heads and feet and that's how we crossed the river I remember sometimes just having a physical reaction to the atrocities that were on my word processor. I remember on various occasions I started... you know, trembling convulsively and not being able to stop. And then it would take some time before I stopped shaking. And also I noticed tremendous hair loss at the time, you know, like just patches of hair... disappearing. One day I remember vividly, she called, she seems very dark, in the mood. I can see she's very unhappy and depressed... Sad. I said, "Are you sure you really want to continue to write this book?" because as a mother, I always worry about her health. And she said, "Yes, I have to. Even that bad, I have to continue." She said, "Look, those survivors, no one seems to pay attention to them. I'm the one who has to make this atrocity known to the world. And thinking about what they go through, what I'm going through is nothing, you know. So I have to finish it." What was really chilling for me was to discover that many of these atrocities were committed not by people who were diabolical, serial types by nature, but by people who were very ordinary citizens. I still have a problem thinking about it and talking about it sometimes. The scars for me run pretty deep because it's really shaken my fundamental belief that human (beings) are basically good at heart. I mean, I can never entirely believe that again. For the first three months after joining the Japanese army we were slapped when we woke up slapped until we went to bed slapped when we got up late slapped if we didn't eat our meals properly slapped when our behaviours were not acceptable and slapped when our buttons were off Thus we were trained to acquire the spirit of soldiers That was how we were trained They were treated like dirt, they were the lowest of the low, and suddenly, here they are in the capital of China where they are more powerful than the "Lords of Creation" for that city. It's easy to see how all those months, or a lifetime perhaps, of pent-up frustration could explode in uncontrollable violence in Nanking. When we entered a village senior soldiers brought farmers and tied them to trees We lined up in one vertical line about ten metres away facing the farmers 'No 1 charge!" The first one charged and stabbed the farmer But the blade has this much width which doesn't go in with the first stab It didn't go into the body and the bayonet slipped in his hand Only this much went in The Chinese opened his eyes wide and spit Then the senior soldier said " Try again " The soldier tried again However killing a person is not easy Then the senior soldier said "Watch me closely I'll show you " The senior soldier charged and turned the bayonet by ninety degrees which made the width of the blade thin enough to easily go right through the ribs He taught us the trick and we tried with easy success This was how we got trained to kill men The Japanese were certainly inculcated for violence and they were taught to believe that the Chinese were subhuman in relation to them. In fact, when you look at some of the diaries of Japanese soldiers at the time you'll see that they refer to the Chinese as, you know, as ants, or as something of less value than pigs, or sheep. We used to call the Chinese "Chankoro Chankoro" and regarded them as an inferior race We thought Japanese were superior We didn't think we were doing anything bad We did what we did for the Emperor Japan and the Japanese people Therefore we thought what we were doing was good It was easy for the Japanese soldier to take Chinese life because he didn't even value his own life. Next to the emperor, all human life was considered meaningless. I spoke with one Japanese soldier said to me that he was taught that duty was as weighty as a mountain compared to his own life which was instead as "light as a feather", and that the greatest honour for a Japanese soldier was to come home a dead martyr for the emperor. She wanted the process by which people are trained to see other people as less than human to be revealed, and Iris was cognizant that it's extremely easy to do. And she wanted this event recorded because you don't know who, in some future time in some other country, reads this book and says, "No, not me. I'm not gonna let this happen in my country or in my place or in my town." People are always arguing about the numbers of dead. They say it's 140,000, 300,000 but that's not even the point because what we do know for sure is many more would have died if that small group of Westerners had not stayed behind and set up that 2 and a half square-mile safe haven in the middle of Nanking. I realized this was a story with heroes as well as villains. The most fascinating of all, I think, was John Rabe. He was the head of the Safety Zone Committee. He was a German businessman and, ironically... a supposed "Nazi"... a "Nazi" humanitarian. He would go throughout the city wearing his swastika armband and the Japanese actually respected the Germans more than the Americans because they had a relationship with Germany at the time. And often he would drive through the city, or walk through the city and he would try to stop atrocities that were in progress. He gave refuge to over 600 Chinese in his own house and for days would go sleepless, ever vigilant of the constant threat of marauding Japanese soldiers looking for women. He and the other Westerners would risk their lives to collect and bring in food to the 200,000 in the safety zone. He also constantly petitioned the Japanese embassy in Nanking to stop the raping and murdering. Consequently, the people of Nanking called him the Living "God". Rabe returned to Germany in February 1938 after the worst of the massacre was over, and then he just vanished. I could never get his story out of my mind, so I decided to find out what happened to him. Finally, she located John Rabe's granddaughter, Ursula Reinhardt, and then she wrote to her and Reinhardt told her there's a diary. And then Iris is so excited and I think I remember she called me immediately, "You know," she said, "I not only found John Rabe, and he had a diary!" I tracked down the descendants of John Rabe in Germany and learned that he had kept a 2,000-page diary of the massacre; a diary, which on various occasions, the family had actually considered tossing out, because the contents were too painful for them to read. Ursula told me that when he returned from Nanking, he went around Berlin giving a series of public lectures, and even sent Adolph Hitler a detailed report about the slaughter. A few days later, the Gestapo showed up at his house and Rabe was told to never talk about Nanking ever again. After the war, because of his Nazi Party membership, the allies would not give him a work permit. So to survive, he sold his treasured Chinese artefacts and all his possessions until his family was reduced to living off acorn soup. A letter from Chinese people arrived arrived and told him how they adored him, how he had saved Chinese people, and they gathered money and sent care parcels to John Rabe. Unfortunately, by then Rabe as a very sick man and a few years later, in 1950, he died of a stroke. It's really hard to discredit the Rabe diaries. His evidence is far too powerful and he can't be discredited anyway. I mean, he is a third-party witness to what happened. He was there on the scene, so how do you deny his reports? In December of 1937, Japanese troops invaded the city of Nanking, China. Now after 60 years, the story of what took place there has been written about in a new book called "The Rape of Nanking". It was written by Iris Chang and we're pleased to have her here on this broadcast... - ...this evening. - Thank you. First printing is about 2,500 copies. It turns out a lot of people, especially the oriental, the Chinese, want to buy that book and they just couldn't find the books in the book store. Actually, the biggest help came from her community because they started talking to Basic Books. They said, "This is outrageous ...And they're Irises! Oh, beautiful. Iris came along when we almost lost hope to bring the Massacre of Nanking to the attention of the world, particularly in the Western world. And I immediately offered to promote Iris's book in Canada provided that I could buy 2,000 of the books. This chapter of history is so important to every Chinese people's heart, especially, starting from the 80s. The Japanese ultra-nationalists, they start to, you know, deny this chapter of history or deny the atrocities. So they really feel that Iris is helping them to express their feelings, their thoughts, and, and their sense of injustice. The 60th anniversary of the Rape of Nanking, we organized a commemorative concert and every seat was filled. And Iris was surprised at the turnout. They came to talk to Iris and also to discuss how to bring this knowledge to the rest of the world. What happened when Iris' book came out was that so many other families like mine, who had basically been suffering in silence like my father had, alone and isolated, saw that here was this book that declared how many hundreds of thousands of people had experienced it. It lent a human perspective to what they had suffered. The reviews started to pour in, and everybody saw this was a major book. A typical book tour lasts two weeks - a great book tour lasts two months - she did a book tour for over a year. It was unheard of. We kept extending it and extending it and extending it. That's how long the interest sustained itself. There's a much more important story here than just the horrible ways in which people were massacred. I feel very fortunate that the "Rape of Nanking" did become a best-seller. I didn't want this story to just disappear, I didn't want all those thousands of people's lives to vanish into oblivion. That's why I wrote it. What really bothered me was that powerful forces out there in Japan wanted the story to go away. I just felt it was insulting to the victims, and I think that individuals have to fight to prevent these acts of genocide from happening, and then being forgotten. If you look at the title of her book, 'The Forgotten Holocaust', that's how people felt. It's a tremendous loss that was forgotten. As you point out, there were more people killed in Nanking... than in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and yet we have amnesia about... about Nanking. Why? Well, I think the Cold War is the main reason why we have this worldwide amnesia on the subject. After 1949, neither the People's Republic of China nor the Republic of China in Taiwan wanted to push the Japanese for reparations or an apology because both of them, ironically, now needed Japan as an ally against each other, and they needed Japan's economic and political support. To this day I think there was a reluctance on the part of both governments to broach the subject with Japan? I think that Iris' book stirred up a hornet's nest here I think that people from the revisionists' school want to minimize or deny Japanese wartime excesses were provoked by it There's a real range of opinion here Nanjing has become a very important and powerful symbol of what Japan did to China that ranges from total denial it never happened it's a pure fabrication of Chinese propagandists to yes lots of bad things happened but those sorts of things tend to happen in war to what is often called the massacre school which are people who actually are doing excellent research about what went on in Nanjing and detailing the extent of the atrocities particularly against non-combatants? It was in the early '80s that Japanese right-wing nationalists started to lash out at those in the massacre school? Some of those individuals in Japan courageous individuals have face ostracism and even death threats and even assassination attempts For example a few years ago the mayor of Nagasaki was shot in the chest merely for stating his belief that Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War Two Katsuich Honda a popular journalist and author wrote detailed accounts of the atrocities and because of death threats has worn a wig and dark glasses in public ever since? I wrote a series of reports called "Travelling in China" interviewing survivors who had memories of Nanjing That was my main focus I've received some death threats not only at work but also at home even at the elementary school my kids were attending I felt in danger so we moved and our address has been unlisted since? She received some very ugly hate mail. For that reason she kept her address private, I never even had her private phone number. I emailed her on everything. I never had address. She was concerned about safety, but she certainly wasn't going to stop. And yet there are people in Japan - prominent businessmen, politicians, academics - so not just the lunatic fringe who say that the whole thing is a lie, that the massacre never happened. It's incredible. Nanking... no ma'am, we did not commit any massacre there in 1937. - None? - That was fabricated, a complete fabrication, by the Chinese. - You don't think eyewitness testimonies, Japanese soldiers' diaries... - and film footage and international... Oh, those film footage were... made up by the Nationalist Chinese Propaganda Ministry. Unfortunately, a mountain of evidence on the Nanking Massacre, including thousands of archival materials in four different languages, as well as photographic and motion picture evidence and widespread news coverage, has not deterred these Japanese extremists from dismissing it all as propaganda or fake evidence. We may have killed a a few thousand, but certainly not in the order of 100,000, 200,000 or 300,000. Nobody was out there with their calculator, you know -- click, click, click, that many people died, oh, that many people were raped. I mean, nobody will ever know, so... if the debate is always fixated on getting the right number, and you can't say anything until you get the right number, the debate will never go forward. And I think when people see interviews with survivors, or hear interviews with them, they suddenly realise this did happen. It cannot be denied any longer. We screamed "Don't stab my mother!" But the Japanese soldier wouldn't listen My mother was stabbed and my brother fell on the ground 'Waaahhh!" he cried The soldier with his bayonet stabbed him in the buttocks and flung him far away I saw him tossed really far and then drop to the ground with a thud My baby brother was crying loudly I ran over and threw myself on him and said 'Don't cry don't cry I'll protect you" I laid on top of him My older sister threw herself against the Jap crying "Don't stab my morn " but he used his bayonet to stab my sister stabbed my sister too The soldier started to stab my little brothers Every one one after another was stabbed to death by him I screamed and cried out loudly 'Don't stab my mamma! Don't stab my mamma!" I screamed for my brothers to leave but they couldn't In the end I fainted? I went to the pile of corpses there was blood everywhere I stepped over the dead corpses I walked toward the sounds of crying And I saw both sides were full of dead bodies And my baby brother was crawling forward? I lifted him up and I saw blood on his body dripping to the ground turning into ice because that day was especially cold I carefully brought him to mama and placed him at mama's side When my mama saw my brother she struggled to tear open her clothes so she could nurse my brother My brother crawled to mama and suckled hungrily My little brother was just a baby he only knew to feed While he was nursing when mama breathed her wounds bubbled with blood When I saw that it made me very sad So then I shook with all my might crying "Mama wake up wake up" I shook her but she wouldn't wake up anymore They were trained. How do you mean trained? Oh, by, the Chinese authority to say those lines. They were given these stories? Yes. I looked into the survivors' eyes and I heard their stories. For people to say they've made it all up, that's just unbelievable. The Japanese should listen to their own soldiers and they should look into the eyes of the survivors themselves... because this mindset is exactly what led to the massacre in the first place. She was arguing or she would get angry, she'd get emotional. Not because of a personal attack, but because they deny. Why people don't want to face the truth? The problem is, is that the conservative political elite more or less tries to promote a collective amnesia, and so they have been whitewashing this history for decades. Japan needs to make a dramatic gesture that shows that it takes responsibility for what happened, acknowledges the extent of those atrocities, and is committed to continue to teach about those, to make sure that this is not forgotten. And my feeling is the revisionists are shooting themselves in the foot. The more that they try to deny, minimize, shift responsibility, the more of a backlash their attracting. And this isn't just from overseas, it's from within Japan as well. In recent years, a multi-ethnic, grassroots movement has emerged internationally to combat these efforts to rewrite history, a movement that includes... not only the Chinese, the Koreans, the Filipinos, leading members of the Jewish community, but also many Japanese-Americans, Japanese-Canadians and Japanese nationals; who recognize that human rights issues transcend those of nationality and ethnicity. Her next book was "The Chinese in America". She told me numerous times she considered that sort of a holiday project, a vacation after all of the atrocities of Nanking. Emotionally it was a little bit easier on her, so I think on several levels she felt more ready to have the family, and also that it was just time. She was over the moon when Christopher came. And she seemed to me throughout the period of "Rape of Nanking" and well into the period of "The Chinese in America" focused on the future, thinking about new projects, happy with her family life, happy with the increasing visibility of the Chinese-American organizations that she cared about greatly. ARCHIVE RADIO NEWS Research for my fourth book started with an oral history project on Bataan POWs. It was an American veteran who wrote and asked me to tell their stories. The same day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour, they also attacked the Philippines, and about 10,000 U.S. and 70,000 Filipino soldiers were forced to surrender, and that led to what became known as... as the Bataan Death March. MUSIC When we do these interviews and talk to these veterans, it's difficult, it's difficult to hear their stories, and to read the accounts... of what these men went through and what they experienced. You walk away with... with these thoughts sort of burdening you. I could only imagine... that after 11 months of again dealing with this topic and hearing these stories over and over that that must have been a tremendous weight, a tremendous emotional burden. I think she took it on because she believed the story needed to be told. She saw herself as a facilitator for those who had been muted by others, by, those in authority, by those who had an interest in not hearing these stories be told. And justice for all means justice for all, and she was not looking for justice for Chinese or for the victims of the Nanking Massacre. She was looking for justice for all. You know, her experience with what she learned writing "The Rape of Nanking", she was afraid of concentrated power in government, and so some of the things that the Bush Administration was doing just complete set her off. I mean, she would react very strongly to that. You know, I lie awake at night with... the voices of the Bataan survivors going round and round in my head... just like Nanking. The voices are different, the details are different, the language is different, but the story is the same. But these men, just like the people in Nanking poured their hearts out to me, somebody had to listen, to record and validate their experience by making it public. I couldn't turn away, just like I couldn't turn away before. ...And I also think it's important to remember these stories, to remind us that no matter how civilized we think we are, it doesn't take much for us to get to the point where we can massacre each other without a second thought. And in the end, I'm... I'm left with one question - when will the madness end? And, sometimes she didn't tell us as much, she just keep to herself, working all the time. At that time she seemed... she was complaining that she couldn't eat, she couldn't sleep. Just it seemed like it was worse than it have ever been before. We noticed that she is very exhausted and that's how I feel her health go down. And she couldn't eat very well either. She didn't have much appetite and couldn't sleep well and, of course, we are very concerned. She had a baby, you know, she already had a fourth book to write, and all the other things, you know. And somehow it just was too much for her. She was going on a research tour and she was getting ready for that. She wasn't sleeping during the day, she was up all day, and all night, and she was up all day, and all night, so she was probably up for 3 or 4 days straight before she went on the trip. She felt she just had to get out there and interview as many of these survivors as she could as quickly as possible, that time was against them and against her. One Monday I checked my messages on the voice mail, and there was a call that said, "It's me," -- you know, no name, but I knew who it was -- "Help. I'm in Kentucky at this number. Help me." And, I called the number and it was a hotel, and they... all they told me was that Iris had checked out. She physically broke down in August when during the trip she was interviewing survivors of the Bataan Death March. It's only three months, so it happened very fast. Yes, we really had a lot of questions we couldn't answer. I was up there twice after her collapse in Kentucky Kentucky and, you know, both times she was very flat. I think her drive, you know, her optimism, all of those defining characteristics, it was just... ...You know, it was like she was suddenly flat whereas before she was just a vibrant ball of energy. After she had her breakdown, she wasn't... she depressed, and then the medicine that she was given made her even more sluggish. They thought it would be a long, long time before she was, you know, back to normal. Or not... probably never back to normal. And she knew she wasn't herself, you know. On some level she did know that and something, you know, had profoundly changed for her. She was very sad and very frightened. She was, I felt, cognisant... very cognisant of losing the person she once was. And that Iris Chang was gone and would never come... No medicine, no therapy was ever gonna bring it back. And she knew it. After she died, it seems part of me die too. But I try to think more positively now because she died so young, I think what we can do is to continue her unfinished work and her dream. You are going to find that we live in a world in which international law has much less to do with actual justice than international politics and money; a world in which those who have power often believe that they are above the truth. My greatest hope is that a few of you in this auditorium today will actually serve as crusaders for truth, beauty and justice in the future. People like that are needed to create a better world for the next generation of humankind on this planet and to ensure the survival of our civilization. Please believe in the power of one: one person can make an enormous difference in this world, one person, actually just one idea, can start a war or end one. You as one individual can change millions of lives, so think big. Do not limit your vision and do not ever compromise your dreams or ideals. MUSIC I gave voice to the voiceless now I'm silencing my own. What I've left behind remember. In you my spirit lives on. Find my light, pass it on. Find my light, pass it on.
