Oh, You're ... You're ... I'm Willie Krueger. I'm the custodian over at the Beck apartments. But, but you know that, don't you? You know that. I guess nobody here can see me or hear me except you. I didn't bring a gift. But I guess that's not important. Thank you for everything you've done for me. As long as I can remember, you've been right by my side. I'll never forget when you walked with me right in those first few hours after I lost Martha. I've always been able to count on you when I've felt dark inside. And when I...you were right there--every time--right there. Even when I didn't feel good about myself, I knew that you cared for me enough. And that... that made me feel better. Like that time I got mad with Mable Huntington because she broke her pipes on purpose just so she could have somebody to see while I came up and fixed them for her. Well, I hollered at her. Boy, I hollered real loud. But then...then I got to thinking that you... you loved Mable just as much as you love me, and I should treat her the way you'd want me to. I, I believe I talked to you about that at the time. Well, I started visiting her, and we became friends. I saw her almost every day until the day she died. I love you. You're my closest, my finest friend. And that means that I can hold my head high wherever I go. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh! I'm terribly sorry to bother you, Mr.... Krueger. Krueger. It's no trouble at all. Come in. Do you want me to make the chocolate now? No. -Where are the others? -They're coming. Did Clarissa leave her mittens here? Oh, yes. They're right here. You hung them on the Christmas tree? Well, you remind me of everything good about Christmas. I couldn't think of a better place. -Here you are. -Thank you, Mr. Krueger. Oh wait, oh, wait, wait. I have something for Clarissa. Merry Christmas. -Thank you. -That's very nice. Why don't you come sing with us? Clarissa! He has things to do, I'm sure. Now come on. She's just excited by Christmas. Oh! Please, won't you come sing with us? I think I'd better stay and keep George company. Goodnight. -Who's George? -George is my cat. But he's asleep. You know, Mr. Krueger, we really could use a good bass. But you don't by chance sing... bass? We're all going for a turkey dinner afterwards, and you'd have to come. Well, the cat does sleep a long time. Well, get your coat. I love you, Mr. Krueger! I love you. That's what Christmas is all about. Clarissa said it to Mr. Krueger, Mr. Krueger said it to Jesus, and Jesus, in so many ways, has said it to all of us.
