Come on and teach us everything you know The summer's over and we're itching to go Neville: I think we're ready for Albus Dumbledore! Dumbledore: Welcoooooome all of you to Hogwarts I welcome all of you to school Did you know that here at Hogwarts we've got a hidden swimming pool? Welcome, welcome, welcome Hogwarts Welcome hotties, nerds, and tools Now that I've got you here at Hogwarts I'd like to go over just a couple of rules My name is Albus Dumbledore and I am headmaster at Hogwarts You can all call me Dumbledore Of course you could always call me Albus if you wanted detention I'm just kidding, I'll expel you if you call me Albus Back to witches and wizards and magical beasts to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts It's all that I love and it's all that I need at Hogwarts, Hogwarts Back to spells and enchantments, potions and friends To Griffindor! Hufflepuff! Ravenclaw! SLYTHERINS! Back to the place where our story begins at Hogwarts, Hogwarts Dumbledore: I'm sorry what's it's name? Hogwarts, Hogwarts Dumbledore: I'm sorry what's it's name? Hogwarts, Hogwarts Dumbledore: I didn't hear you kids! Hogwarts, Hogwarts Harry: Man I'm glad I'm back Welcome to another magical year at Hogwarts and a very special welcome to my favorite student Mister Harry Potter He killed Voldemort when he was just a baby He's even got that little lightning scar on his forehead to prove it And another very special welcome to our newest addition to Griffindor, Mister Ginny- Excuse me, Misses Ginny Weasley Ginny: Yeah, I'm a girl... and um, also Aren't we supposed to be sorted by the Sorting Hat? Dumbledore: Well um, a funny thing happened to the Sorting Hat He actually got hitched with another piece of enchanted magical clothing So he and the Scarf of Sexual Preference aren't going to be back until next year Basically I've just been putting anybody who looks like a good guy into Gryffindor anybody who looks like a bad guy into Slytherin and the other two could just go wherever the hell they want I don't really care Cedric: Hufflepuffs are particularly good Finders! What the hell is a Hufflepuff? Anyway it's time for me to introduce my very good friend our own Potions professor, Mister Severus Snape Ron: Aw man That Snape, I'd hoped they'd fired that guy Ginny: Why? What's wrong with Professor Snape? Ron: Uh, nothing. He's just, uh the Devil Ron: He's Harry's nemesis, look at him Harry: Come on Ron, he's really not that bad. I don't know what you're talking about- Snape: Harry Potter... Detention What? For talking out of turn Now before we begin, I'm going to give you all your very, very first Pop quiz Hermione: Yesss... Can anyone tell me what a Portkey is? Ah yes, Miss Granger A Portkey is an enchanted object that when touched will transport the one or ones who touch it to anywhere in the globe decided upon by the enchanter Ah very good... Now can anyone tell me what foreshadowing is? Yes Miss Granger? Foreshadowing is a dramatic device in which an important plot point is mentioned earlier in the story to return later in a more significant way Perfect! So... What's a- what's a Portkey exactly? Hermione: Oh, a Portkey is something that when you touch it, it will transport you anywhere Ron: Not you- Hermione: Oh, a Portkey is something that when you touch it, it will transport you anywhere Oh my God... Hermione: Oh, a Portkey is something that when you touch it, it will transport you anywhere And remember a Portkey can be any sort of seemly harmless object like a football or... A dolphin Professor? Can like a person be a Portkey? No that's absurd Because then if a person were to touch themselves... They would constantly be transported into different places A person can however be a Horcrux What's a... what's a Horcrux? I'm not even going to tell you Harry, you'll find out soon enough Professor, what is the point of this quiz? Oh no, no no point in particular Just important information that everyone should know Especially you Now moving right along, we've got our four houses in all Gryffindor Ravenclaw Hufflepuff Cedric: Find! Snape: What? And Slytherin Now traditionally... Traditionally points are given for good behavior and deducted for rule breaking Example: Ten points from Gryffindor for Miss Granger's excessive baby fat Thanks Hermione Traditionally the house with the most points at the end of the year would win the House Cup however this year we're doing things a bit differently Here to introduce it is our new Professor of the Dark Arts Professor Quirrell Harry: Ow ow oww Hermione: Harry, what's wrong? Harry: Ow ow oww Hermione: Harry, what's wrong? The House Cup a time honored tradition for centuries- Draco: Go home terrorist! For centuries... the four houses of Hogwarts have competed for the honor and glory of holding the title of House Champion But where does this competition come from and what are the roots of the tradition? The House Cup Tournament began with the first generation of Hogwarts students That was a rhetorical question Dumbledore: Granger, quit interrupting. Twenty points from Gryffindor Ron: Thanks Hermione Quirrell: As I was saying... When the tournament first originated it was one of a completely different sort One champion from each of the four houses would complete a series of dangerous tasks Challenges- the winner would not only win the cup He would also win eternal glory Hermione: Kind of like a House Cup- or no, a Triwizard Tournament! Quirrell: Yes. Sort of like the Triwizard Tournament except no, not like that at all There are four houses How can it be the Triwizard Tournament with four teams? Well uh Professor if I remember correctly the House Cup Tournament was disbanded after one semester when one of its students was killed during the first task Yes, it is very dangerous but the rewards far outweigh the risks I don't think you heard me. I just said somebody died! Dumbledore: Hermione Granger shut your ungodly, lopsided mouth and quit interrupting. Twenty more points! Ron: Thanks Hermione! God... For the cleverest witch of your age, you really can be a dumbass sometimes Ten points to Dumbledore Yes, yes well it will be very dangerous but the winner will be remembered as a hero for ages to come And as professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts I believe that this practical application is exactly what the curriculum needs to- ACHOO! Dumbledore: Gesundheit Did your turban just sneeze? W-what? N-no I could have sworn I heard a sneeze coming from your direction but your mouth wasn't moving No... that- That was simply a fart, excuse me ACHOO! Harry: Ow ow oww! Oww, oh... Jeez... oh my God oww Quirrell: I must be going Jeez... oh my God oww Jeez... oh my God oww ACHOO! Quirrell: I've simply farted once more, excuse me. Dumbledore: In co-ordinance with the newly resurrected House Cup a champion from each house will be selected to compete So Snape, would you do us the honors please? Yes headmaster First, from the Ravenclaw house... Miss Cho Chang Oh my God I've won- I can't believe it, y'all! And next from Hufflepuff... a Mister Cedric Diggory Well I don't find this surprising at all Cho: I find it perfect now I can spend more time with my beloved boyfriend I'm glad as well my darling Snape: And next, from the Slytherin house... A Draco Malfoy I finally beat you didn't I, Potter? What do you think of that, huh? I'm the champion this time! Dumbledore: Draco would you sit down you little shit? Champion's just a title Snape: And finally from the Gryffindor house... Oh my Well isn't this curious? The one person in all of Hogwarts whom I have a well-known grudge against is suddenly in a tournament where he may very well lose his life Neville: If it's me, I'll apologize to my fellow Gryffindors right now for losing Sit down you inarticulate bumble It's Harry Potter Dumbledore: Well here they are folks, the four Hogwarts champions I want all of you to start preparing immediately because the first task is in two months and it could be anything So let's get to it! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Draco: Malfoy! Malfoy! Mal- Mal... Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Ron: Harry You got this tournament in the bag I don't know man... Cedric Diggory, he's pretty awesome- NOT! He sucks. We're totally gonna win, it's in the bag I don't know, Harry Ron: OH MY GOD I don't know, Harry Ron: OH MY GOD Hermione, shut up. Why do you have you rain on everybody's parade? Because, Ron, this is dangerous! Dangerous? Oh come on Hermione, how dangerous can it be? Especially for me Well- you're not invincible, Harry. Somebody died in this tournament. Uh, I'm The Boy That Lived Not died. Duhh What's the worst that can happen? And I don't know about that Quirrell character You know, first he resurrects some horrible ancient tournament Then- then he bumps into you and your scar starts to hurt and you have to admit, there is something really funky about the back of his head Come on, think about it Professor Quirrell is a professor, and who hires the professors? Dumbledore The smartest, most awesomest Practical wizard Beautiful wizard in the whole world Why... why would he possibly hire somebody who's trying to hurt me? W-What about Snape? Yeah what about him? He's hated you for years and he's hated your parents too, Harry, everybody knows that and he just so happens to pick your name out of the House Cup, out of hundreds if not, five possible Gryffindors? Yeah... what a coincidence. We lucked out No- no Harry, I don't think it is a coincidence When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about Harry: Okay When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about Harry: Alright cool, so let me get this straight When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about Harry: Alright cool, so let me get this straight So you're saying that this tournament, is just one big ploy to try and kill me Hermione: I mean, I don't know! Maybe? Anyway I just think it's dangerous and I don't think you should do it Alright Hermione if it means that much to you... I'll drop out Oh thank you Harry Ron: Wait, wait WHAT? The House Cup? What about all the eternal glory you'd win? Come on! Hey... eternal glory I've already got that Besides, Neville will be a great champion! Ron: No, no, no Besides, Neville will be a great champion! Ron: No, no, no I do not want Schlongbottom to be my champion Okay all you have to do- Oh look There's Dumbledore. Why don't you just talk to him now and tell him that you're dropping out? Um... listen, listen Hermione Dumbledore and I are really, really cool. We're super tight and I don't want him to think that I'm being lazy or disrespectful or anything So can you just tell-? Why don't you tell him? Just tell him that I want to work on school or something Alright? Hey You got this one. You're the best Hermione: Alright... okay Harry: You got it Hermione: Alright... okay Harry: Don't worry about it Hermione: Alright... okay Hermione: Alright... okay Dumbledore? Yes Granger? I need to talk to you for a moment. It's about the House Cup tournament Um... well first of all, I think it's an awful idea, but um Second of all, I don't think Harry Potter should compete Granger why do you always gotta be such a big ol' stick in the mud, huh? Pray, tell me why Harry Potter should not compete Uh... because he- wants to study Granger, nobody studies at Hogwarts except for you Uh, okay well he- he wants to focus on the O.W.L.s Why couldn't Harry have told me this himself? He thinks I'm cool We're tight! Ahh... Profess- I'm a really bad liar, okay? I- I think it's a ruse. A set up And I even think Snape might be trying to kill Harry Potter Dumbledore: Severus Snape is one of the kindest, bravest, gentlest, sexiest men I have ever met Severus Snape is trying to kill Harry Potter just about as much as he's trying to kill me Huh? Snape: Oh why Professor Dumbledore... I just happened to be in the kitchen and I made you this delicious sandwich... Why thank you Severus! Do you see, Granger? How thoughtful Here you are Professor Bomb-appetit I mean- Bon appetit... Um... is that sandwich ticking? It looks like it's licking Finger-licking good Professor, I don't think you should eat that sandwich! Come on Granger, you gotta listen to Snape more often You might even get a sandwich out of it, I don't know Dumbledore: Granger, what the hell-? Granger, what are you doing!? You dog-gone exploded my sandwich! Hermione: I'm sorry Sir! Hey, even if I did believe that Harry Potter was in danger He has to compete! You see that cup? Hermione: Yes! It's enchanted Whoever's name comes out of the cup has to compete or the results would be bad What do you mean bad? Well, try to imagine your entire life stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light A total plutonic reversal! Yeah... so you see he has to compete then- Hermione if it makes you feel any better the last guy who died in the tournament was a Hufflepuff So um... I'll keep my eyes open, and nothing's gonna get past ol' Dumbledore Alright I gotta go make myself another sandwich although I don't know how it's gonna be as good as the last one The last one ticked! Because it was a bomb... Harry, I'm so sorry but- I-I think you're going to have to compete in the House Cup tournament But don't worry. I won't rest until I found out what the first task is gonna be And I'll sabotage all the other champions so you win by default Alright, awesome Draco: Well... Isn't this touching? Oh my God just butt out, Malfoy Goyle and I have a bet, you know He says you won't last five minutes in this tournament I disagree I say you won't last five minutes... at Pigfarts! What? Alright, Malfoy, what- What is Pigfarts? Oh! Never heard of it? Hah, figures... Famous Potter doesn't even know about Pigfarts Malfoy, don't act like you don't want to talk about it That's like the ninth time you've mentioned Pigfarts. What is Pigfarts? Pigfarts is only the greatest wizarding school in the galaxy It's where I'm being transferred next year Hermione: Malfoy, I've never heard of that Draco: That's because Pigfarts... is on Mars Harry: Malfoy, you know, we're trying to have a conversation here so you could just leave us alone Oh! No, I'm not even here So anyways, I think we could out what the first task from Dumbledore Draco: Dumbledore! Pfft! What an old coot! He's nothing like Rumbleroar! Goyle: RUMBLEROAR! Harry: Anyway, like I was saying- Draco: Rumbleroar is the headmaster at Pigfarts He's a lion... who can talk Malfoy, if you don't mind we're trying to have a conversation here it's not like- you're not even eating. Get out of here! Well I can't help it if we can hear everything you say. We're the only ones in here Well just- come on Malfoy. Just get out of here, please? Draco: Where are we supposed to go? Harry: Uh, I don't know, uh, Pigfarts Now you're just being cute I can't go to Pigfarts It's on Mars You need a rocketship Do you have a rocketship, Potter? Bet you do! You know not all of us inherited enough money to buy out NASA when our parents die Look at this! Look at this Look it- Rocketship Potter! Starkid Potter Moonshoes Potter Traversing the galaxy for intergalactic travels to Pigfarts Harry: Alright that's it. This is the most misguided way to try to make me feel jealous I don't care if you make fun of me but if you bring my parents into this, it's a whole other story Draco: Whoa! Not so fast- Potter! Oh Crabbe! Goyle! Harry: Oh sure just behind- just Goyle: BACK OFF NERD! Harry: Oh sure just behind- just Goyle: BACK OFF NERD! Harry: Whoa! Scared, scared! Not so tough now, are you, Potter? Maybe you should hang out with someone better than that lollygagging Ginger and his stupid Mudblood girlfriend Hermione: Oh that is it, Malfoy! Jelly-legs Jinx! Draco: Oh come on Goyle: Hey no fair our legs are jelly! Take it back Malfoy! Draco: Take what back? Take back what you said about your stupid made-up space school Ron: Yeah and all that stuff about Hermione being my girlfriend that's not even a little bit true Hermione: And say you're sorry for calling me a you-know-what! Malfoy: I'm sorry! And you promise you'll never do it again? I promise! Hermione: Alright Now next time we tell you to leave us alone you better do it Come on Harry, Ron, let's get out of here Besides you... already ate all my lunch Harry: Wow, thanks Hermione Hermione: Yeah Unjellify! Ron: Wow that was like the most badass thing I've ever seen Too bad no one was here to see it though. It was like an outburst of pent-up aggression It was like ARGHH HERMIONE! Wow... That sucked royal Hippogriff! We got beat by a girl, who is a nerd Draco: I didn't mean what I said, you know Pigfarts is real Am I... am I bleeding? Goyle? No! I thought maybe it was m-maybe it was a little bit I've never been pushed down like that by a girl Maybe I shouldn't call her a Mud- Whatever I can't believe I couldn't figure out the counter-curse was just Unjellify Draco: Right, well I'm not surprised Come on let's go watch Wizards of Waverly Place Quirrell: Fools! They're all fools They think they're safe They think they're back for another fun year of learning shenanigans at Hogwarts Little do they know the danger that's lurking right under their noses Or should I say, on the back of their heads? Voldemort: I can't breathe in that damn turban! I'm sorry my Lord, it's a necessary precaution for if they knew that you lived That when Harry Potter destroyed you, your soul lived on Yes, that when my body was destroyed I was forced to live in the Forbidden Forest eating bugs and mushrooms and- ugh unicorn blood Quirrel: Until I found you and let you attach yourself to my soul unicorn blood Quirrel: Until I found you and let you attach yourself to my soul Yes, nobody must know any of that Now... Quirrell! Get me some water! Now Quirrell! Pour it in my mouth! Your plan to infiltrate Hogwarts on the back of my head is going swimmingly, my liege Yes, yes, yes I'm done with the water! We must not have anymore foul ups like tonight in the Great Hall I'm sorry my Lord, you sneezed Voldemort: I know that! Get me some Nasonex, you swine! Wash that turban! It tickles my nose Quirrel: Yes my Dark King... Voldemort: Okay, just relax with the Dark King, okay? I... I watch you wipe your butt daily You can call me Voldemort, we're there We've reached that point Yes, yes my Voldemort Now Quirrell Get us ready for bed We must be well rested if we wish to kill Potter Tonight in the Great Hall He was so close I could have touched him Revenge is at my fingertips, Quirrell I can taste it It tastes like... Cool mint Quirrell: That's our Listerine, Voldemort Yes, excellent Well, er... goodnight Quirrell Quirrell: Goodnight Okay, okay, I can't do this You gotta roll over I can't sleep on my tummy Quirrell: I always sleep on my back, I have back troubles it's the only way I'm comfortable Voldemort: You roll over right now or I'll I'll eat your pillow! You'll be having a dream that you're eating a giant marshmallow but really you'll wake up, and your favorite goose feather pillow will be missing Quirrell: Fine, we'll compromise. We'll sleep on our sides Okay I guess I can do this Quirrell: Now goodnight Goodnight Quirrell Hey Quirrell How long have those robes been on that chair? Quirrell: I think they're from last night. I just put them there for now Well are you planning on putting them in a hamper? What's your plan for these? I figured I'd just leave them there for now and maybe put them away in the morning, okay? No! No, no that's not okay I can't go to sleep knowing that there are dirty clothes on that chair The chair's going to start to smell like dirty clothes Quirrell: Look, I promise I'll put them away in the morning You put them away right now! I command you to get up and fold them at least! Make it into a neat pile Look, if we're going to be in this situation for a while we're going to have to live with each other Now I've been single for all of my life and I have some habits and sometimes I leave laundry around Well I believe that everything has its place Muggles have their place Mudbloods have their place and so do your clothes! Namely, a dresser! Quirrel: Well Aren't we an odd couple? You won't sleep on your tummy You won't sleep on your back We're quite a kooky couple you'll agree We share some hands and fingers and yet the feeling lingers... We're just about as different as anyone can be You like planting a garden and I like plotting to kill You think that you should rule the world I think books are a thrill! Sipping tea by the fire is swell Voldemort: Pushing people in is fun as well! I like folding all of my ties And you have no friends. Hey! That's a surprise I guess it's plain to see, when you look at you and me We're different, different, as can be You're a sissy, a twat, a girl! I'm the darkest of lords Quirrell: I'm the brightest professor here I've won several awards! Voldemort: My new world's about to unfold You got beat by a two year old I'll kill him this time, through and through Quirrell: Or you might just give him another tattoo You really must agree, when you look at you and me We're different, different, as can- I'll rise again and I'll rule the world! but you must help me renew For when our plan succeeds Quirrell: Prevails! part of that world goes to you When I rule the world, I'll plant flowers When I rule the world, I'll have Snakes! Quirrel: And Jane Austin noooooovels! Voldemort: And goblins, and werewolves, a fleet of dementors and giants, and thestrals, and all my Death Eaters! Quirrel: And Jane Austin noooooovels! When I rule the World! Harry, don't you think you should try and figure out what the first task is going to be? You can actually die if you're not ready What? Come on... I mean, can't you just do it for me? Can't you just prepare all of my stuff for me? I mean- what are you doing right now? I'm writing your Potions essay Oh well do that first, 'cause that's due tomorrow so... But after that, after that can you prepare for the first task? Please? Thank you. You are the best You got it.

Ron: Well what're we gonna do? Hermione: It's simple guys The cloak Of course The cloak Ginny: Wait what cloak? Shut up! Harry: I got a present- I got a present last year Oh bye Neville I got a present last year. First year of Hogwarts and uh... well, it was left to me by my dad The dad that's dead. My father is dead My dead father Used to solve mysteries and stuff. My Invisibility Cloak! Ginny: Wow! Oooh boy, wowie Harry Potter! A real Invisibility Cloak! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Do you know what I would do if I had an Invisibility Cloak? Oh man I would- I would kick, uh I would kick wiener dogs And I would pretend to be a ghost and I would scare mean people I'd use it to avoid ever having to face my reflection in the mirror Harry: That's a bummer Ron: Jesus, what's wrong with you? Well, actually, I was gonna say that I would use it to fake my own death and watch people cry at the funeral Okay anyway, let's get out of here before Neville gets out of the bathroom Alright? Let's get out of here Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa where do you think you're going? Ginny: Um... with you guys No, no, no way. No kid sisters allowed Okay? Besides, there's only enough room under this cloak for two people So uh... Come on Hermione, come on The way his hair falls in his eyes Makes me wonder if he'll... Ever see through my disguise And I'm under his spell Everything is falling, and I don't know where to land Everyone knows who he is But they don't know who I am Harry Harry Why can't you see? What you're doing to me? I've seen you conquer certain death Even when you're just standing there You take away my breath And maybe Someday you'll hear my song and understand That all along There's something more, that I'm trying to say! When I say Harry Harry Why can't you see? What you're doing to me? What you're doing to me? Quirrell: Master! Master! The shipments for the first task of the tournament have just arrived! Voldemort: Yes I know Quirrell I hear everything that you hear Isn't it wonderful now? Well we made sure Harry Potter's name was drawn from the cup and soon he will be ours Yes It's really happening, isn't it Quirrell? You know, with the plan going so well I feel maybe we should celebrate What do you say Quirrell? How's about we go out? I hear it's karaoke night down at the Hog's Head Uh I don't know I have all these papers to grade, and I've been giving so much attention to this revenge plan that I'm really behind Ah come on Quirrell! You've been working so hard all year You deserve a night off But the papers... Oh just give them all B minuses and be done with it Now that's evil Yeah, thanks, I am the Dark Lord Come on, just a few drinks Hey we'll try to pick up some chicks I wouldn't know what to say. I'm no good at that Come on, it'll be fun You just move your lips and I'll do the talking Quirrell Man! Listen I may just be a parasite on the back of your head that's literally devouring your soul any time you take a breath But I can see that You're too good a guy not to have a bit of fun once in a while You deserve this Well if you put it that way then Yeah let's just go wild tonight That's the spirit Quirrell! Put on a fresh pair of wizard shorts and grab your tunic Quirrell we are gonna get you laid Seriously man, back when I had a body I had mad game with the bitches Just ask Bellatrix Lestrange Ron: This cloak isn't as big as it used to be Hermione: Shh, someone's coming! Did you just hear something? Goyle: No Only quiet Maybe... one raindrop No matter Tell me, Goyle Who do you think is the ugliest girl in school? Uh... Oh, Buckbeak For sure Crabbe? Crabbe: Uh, Winky the house elf Good one Obscure You know who I think is the ugliest girl in school? That Hermione Granger You know what I'd give her, on a scale of one to ten? With one- One would be the ugliest and then ten the most pretty I would give her... An eight An eight point five Or a nine Not- not over A nine point eight Because there is always room for improvement Not everyone's perfect, like me That's why I am holding out for a ten Because I'm worth it Come on! Let's go Ron: Wow what a bunch of jerks Hermione: Alright, forget them now- Where did you say you saw those crates being delivered? Ron: Well I think they were being delivered to the auditorium So they should be at the end of this hallway and to the left Ron: Look! Hermione: A goat? Harry: A goat? Oh my God I have to fight a goat? I don't know if I could do that morally Snape: And the goats have all been sent for feeding time, headmaster Dumbledore: Oh feeding time? Dragons don't want to be fed They want to hunt! Harry: Did he just say dragons? Snape: Did you just say "did he just say dragons?" Dumbledore: I must have because anybody else hiding in this room would have known to shut up Potter Snape: Headmaster do you really think it's wise to have children fight dragons? No Snape I don't think it's wise to do anything anymore Like, here I am alive and well today and I could very well be killed by you, tomorrow Snape: Why that's absurd Dumbledore: First... let's go to bed Have you ever seen my room? I've got some pretty kickin' posters on my wall Snape: Well I am rather tired Harry: Aw man, I have to fight a dragon? This is bogus! Hermione: Well... Harry: How can I fight a dragon, I'm just a little kid! Ron: Alright well, well maybe it won't be that bad, Harry Maybe, maybe you'll just have to fight like Mushu from Mulan or... Ron: I dunno maybe I dunno maybe like Puff the Magic Dragon or something... Hermione: Ron, this is serious okay? Harry could die! Now look, there's still time, alright? We just need to figure out a plan Harry: Okay well we should probably do that back in the common room Where's- wait- where's the Invisibility Cloak? Ron: Well I threw it over on that magical walking chair over the- Oh crap Harry: Oh that's... that's gonna be an issue Ron: Yep Quirrell: I thought walking home drunk was hard before We should've realized that with with both of us drinking into one belly we'd get twice as drunk Hey Quirrell Quirrell Quirrell, Quirrell, Quirrell, Quirrell Quirrell, Quirrell, Quirrell you remember that girl you were talking to? Yeah You remember that girl we were talking to? Well I was talking to her sister on my side Oh so that's why she freaked out when we stood up! Voldemort: Because they didn't know that we were the same person! Quirrell: One person! Voldemort: Because they didn't know that we were the same person! You know I haven't had- I haven't had this much fun since Nearly Headless Nick's Death Day party of '91 I haven't had this much fun since, ah Yeah well shit I can't remember ever having this much fun You never had fun... ever? Doing doing anything? Maybe that's why you're so evil Yeah maybe Definitely to do with the fact that Muggles and Mudbloods make me sick to my stomach, but uh... Yeah I guess you could be right. I guess, I mean That's kind of funny What is it, Voldemort? Oh it's just that I never I never ever really ever ever really ever ever really considered another reason for me being so evil, you know? 'Cause normally I just, uh I just kill people that try to get me to open up, you know? Oops... But uh, it's- it's kind of nice to just, um Kind of nice to just talk You know, I have to admit I was kind of nervous when you first demanded that you attached yourself to my soul Yeah I could, I could sense that But like, now I think it's It's kind of cool, it's like having a really close roommate or or even... Yeah like a slave Like a, like a Death Eater No man It's like... having a friend I've never had a friend before It looks like we've got one now Who would've thought that at the beginning of this year we'd feel like that for each other? I guess everything is different between us now, huh? I guess it's plain to see When you look at you and me We're... different Different As can be We simply guarantee, when you look at you and me We're different, different As can be It's a comedy of sorts When you're bound to Voldemort And I'm happy as a squirrel Long as I'm with Mister Quirrell We'll lead them to the slaughter and we'll murder Harry Potter We're different Different Different, different as can be The Hogwarts champions shall now enter the champion's tent in preparation for the first task Oh man, I can't believe I have to skip lunch period for this stupid task Okay Harry, today's the day The day you fight the dragon. Now, did you read those notes I wrote for you on dragons? No What? Why not? You kidding me? They were so boring So y-you didn't read them. You didn't prepare at all? You're not prepared at all? Well no, at least I have my wand Um... Brought my- Harry You're the best Harry just, please don't die today I don't want to see my best friend getting eaten by a dragon Relax okay? Save the tears for my funeral So tell me more about this Pigfarts. I find it to be very interesting Well While you're there you have to wear your spacesuit at all times because there's no atmosphere on Mars So if a single docking bay door opens you'll probably die My, how dreadful Well, but the good news is If you're a good enough student, Rumbleroar lets you ride around on his back And he's the headmaster lion? Who can talk Cool... Well hello Harry. How are you feeling today? Hey Cedric. Trying to- Stay positive Cedric: Well good I'm having a fine time at the championships Miss Granger? Hello Cho: Sugar pie! My darling! Was that a kiss for good luck? No, that was for being so cotton-picking cute! This one's for good luck Harry: I hate that guy Hermione: It's okay Harry, you're going to be great today Dumbledore: Oh God! Granger, I thought you were a boggart. I'm terrified of them And what the hell are you doing in the champions' tent? Get out of here. Ten more points Thanks Hermione Are you kids ready to fight a dragon? Of course you are, you're just children. What the hell am I thinking? Now outside of this tent are thousands upon thousands of screaming fans They're either going to be cheering for you, or the dragon but either way they're going to be making some kind of noise. So- in order for this election process to be fair I am going to randomly select a cardboard cutout size version of the dragon you will be defeating For you Cedric... Puff the Magic Dragon Figment the Imaginary Dragon The Reluctant Dragon And for you Potter... The Hungarian Horntail the most terrifying thing you'll ever see in your whole life! Dumbledore: You've gotten all complete Harry: W-wait hold on a second. Dumbledore, wait a second Dumbledore: You've gotten all complete I think I will- Harry: W-wait hold on a second. Dumbledore, wait a second T-this is terrifying Those are the cutest things I've ever seen This thing is horrifying Just use your imagination Disembrace Oh my God this competition's gonna suck all these dragon's are wimps Accio doublestuff Wow, look at that one Oh my God monster! Is that yours? Yeah! Oh my God it's awesome Let me hold it Oh my God this thing is terrifying I hope the real thing is smaller Ferocious. What're you gonna do? I don't know, I'm not cut out for this kind of thing. It's gonna kill me Hermione: Ron- Ron! You can't be in here this is the champions' tent! Snape: Miss Granger What the devil are you doing in the champions' tent? Ten points from Gryffindor Harry: Thanks Hermione Thanks Hermione Hey! Good luck buddy Bye Snape! Snape: Bye Cedric Diggory Now is your chance to face your dragon Alright fellas wish me luck I believe in you That's all I needed to hear Hey Malfoy, tell you what I'll let you switch dragons with me I'll give you the chance to switch dragons with me. I'll give you that opportunity Tell you what, don't worry about it Let me think abou- No I'll, uh, I'll give you my Gushers Oh, no, no I have a Fruit by the Foot I don't want to A Cho Chang? Your dragon awaits Well... I can't imagine this would be very hard Then I... imagine it won't be Malfoy, come on! Uh, tell you what I'll throw in my Teddy Grahams, with the Gushers You can make little Gusher Teddy Graham sandwiches Alright You throw in that pack of Bugles and you've got yourself a deal Absolutely not Draco Malfoy, your turn Professor Snape is there any way that I could, I dunno, forfeit or switch dragons Or maybe just take a day off What- what're you, what're you. What're you doing? What is that? I'm protecting you Potter Welsh Greenbacks can't stand the taste of Hunt's tomato ketchup But I'm not fighting a Welsh Greenback, I'm fighting a Hungarian Horntail Oho, well silly me Hunt's tomato ketchup is what Hungarian Horntails love best of all Good luck Potter What? No! Dumbledore: And now Harry Potter will battle the terrifying Hungarian Horntail the most terrifying thing you'll ever see in your whole life It should be noted that this particular dragon has not been fed in two weeks Hermione: Come on Harry Go Harry! You can do it Harry Ron: You got it, yeah! You got this Hermione: Just think positive. You can do it! Ron: You got it, yeah! You got this Hermione: Just think positive. You can do it! Oh my God! Accio guitar! Hey dragon You don't gotta do this Let's reevaluate our options Throw away our old assumptions 'Cause really, you don't gotta go through this I'm really not that special The Boy Who Lived is only flesh and bone The truth is in the end I'm pretty useless without friends In fact I'm alone I spend my time at school Trying to be this cool guy I never even asked for I don't know any spells Still manage to do well But there's only so long that can last for I'm living off the glory Of a stupid children's story that I have nothing to do with I just sat there and got lucky So level with me buddy I can't defeat thee So please don't eat me And all I can do is sing a song for you You never asked to be a dragon! I never asked to be a champion! We both just jumped on this bandwagon but all we need is guitar jammin' Goodnight dragon One, two, three! I beat the dragon! Attention all Hogwarts students Tonight is our annual Yule Ball So please remember to pick up your Yule Ball wreath and give it to that special someone Ah! Ginger! Oh, hey. Harry Potter?

Yeah I'll probably go stag too And the only two girls that I know that don't have dates already are Ginny and Hermione Oh my God And I'm not going with my stupid sister And I think of Hermione as a sister so that's out We are in such a puzzle Harry: What a conundrum Neville: Hi, look at these strapping young men Hey Neville Hey Neville, you want this Yule Ball wreath? Uh yeah, if you're willing to part with it then I will take this wreath Hey Ron, let's go hang out with Hagrid He can teach us how to dance so we could get in our dress robes That can only lead to disaster and hilaree Well let's go I mean I just don't know about Hermione. I don't think anyone's asked her yet, you know 'cause she's just- she's just so butt ugly Harry: Hideous Give that plant nerd! Oh, Goyle rules! Draco: Yeah so anyway He was reluctant enough at first but I lured it out of its cage with an upside down pig and I sewed it with my Fruit by the Foot and beheaded it with a quick slicing charm. Bloody fool... Wh- Goyle? What are you doing with that wreath? What are you, going to ask someone to the Yule Ball? ...No Dancing is for nerds Crabbe: And pretty girls That's right You know who the last girl I'd have asked to the Yule Ball would be? That Hermione Granger Not even if we were the last two people on earth and she looked absolutely stunning in her ball gown so every time I'd looked at her I'd got butterflies in my tummy Not even then You know They don't even have dances at Pigfarts All of the noise would disturb Rumbleroar's slumbering cub Dancing is for pansies Right Draco: Hey you there what's your name? Pansy Perfect! You're going to the Yule Ball with me Do you see that dragon? Well it was reluctant enough at first but I lured it out of its cage with an upside down... Quirrell: Yule Ball decorating crew but I lured it out of its cage with an upside down... Quirrell: Yule Ball decorating crew Just the Yule Ball decorating crew coming through Last minute decorations My Lord, the Yule Ball has finally arrived and I've brought the key! Yes I know Quirrell I hear everything you hear! I'm sorry No I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped I'm just nervous that's all Nervous? No Why? I don't want to talk about it Hey, it's just me You can tell me anything, you know that Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right I'm just nervous because we've been planning this night for so long and I want everything to go perfectly, you know? Don't worry. We've mapped out everything We've anticipated every little problem and compensated for it We've even prepared what you're going to say to Potter when you see him So just cool down Relax By the end of the night you'll have your revenge and your body back You're right, you're right I'm being... silly And you know I- Quirrell over the last year I've- I've really grown attached to you No pun intended Yeah I know what you mean But, hey, we'll still hang out Just because we won't be attached doesn't mean we'll be two completely different people No pun intended No, no of course not, of course not Hey Quirrell We should make plans Evil plans? Oh uh... No Casual plans Like um We could go rollerblading on a Saturday and then uh see a movie at night, huh? Yeah It'll be great because we'd both be able to watch it for a change Yeah yeah... I bet it'll be nice to sleep in our own beds Not have someone behind you all the time And have the privacy of my old life back again The solitude No Whatever happens tonight man It's- It's been a blast Yeah One crazy year Hey Promise we'll go rollerblading and see that movie Oh, man I promise Okay Quirrell Let's go plant that key and split Pun intended! Snape: Why Professor Quirrell What on earth are you doing in the Great Dance Hall? Just moments before the dance? Just decorating for the Yule Ball. Last minute decorations Just one final touch A ladle? A very special ladle for a very special night For a very special punch And what's so special about it? Let's just say there's Squirt in it Squirt? Is that not the favorite drink of one Harry Potter? Is it? I had no idea Well, we better be going We? I... I better be going Loud music hurts my ears Okay well I'll see you later then Or maybe you won't Or maybe I will Dumbledore: Excuse me, it was my fault Hey Severus! Oh, uh Headmaster Dumbledore: What are you doing here? Getting some punch are you? Oh no no there's Squirt in that Oh only Harry Potter likes that hog's shit I'll stick to my Red Bull thank you very much Oh well goodnight Headmaster Severus I- I saved this last dance for you Well I would Headmaster, but you see Well an old friend is coming back into town tonight Dumbledore: Oh Hey Ron Ron: Hey what's up dude how's it going? Have you seen Hermione anywhere? Harry: No I haven't Harry: Why? Nothing, nothing. It's just, you know I- I heard Parvati Patil telling Padma Patil that she had seen Hermione in the girl's locker room before just crying her eyes out in the bathroom stall Harry: Why? What happened? I don't know isn't that like the saddest thing you've ever heard? Harry: Yeah I mean I don't know it's just It was inevitable that one day Hermione would realize that nobody would ever like her, you know? Because of her obnoxious personality and her ugly face and misshapen body, but you know it's just I don't know, I figured she'd get into at least one night of happiness before she realize she was gonna be growing old alone, you know? Draco: Hey you two over here talking about Granger? Malfoy get out of here it's none of your business Why don't you go dance with Pansy over there? Hey, go get me some punch Pansy: Okay Wait, um, I should tell you there's Squirt in it Harry: Oh nice Squirt? Ugh Harry: Oh nice Never mind I'll stay dehydrated Go, go powder your nose or something But I just fixed my make up a little while ago Ugh, trust me You need more powder Pain in the ass, right? So anyway Noticed Granger's not around here Probably for the better too No one would be able to keep their hummus and pita chips down with that ugly mug of hers darting all about Wow, why don't you just give her a break for once Okay Malfoy? Why defending her, Weasley? Have a crush? No! No! Why all the insults Malfoy? Covering up a crush? Ron: Yeah? Yeah? Oh... right, right Ron: Yeah? Yeah? Oh... right, right Like I could ever have a crush on that stupid... Cho: Oh my gosh! Y'all! Cho: She looks so beautiful! Bless her heart She looks great! Here I am, face to face, with a situation I never thought I'd ever see Strange How a dress can take a mess Make her nothing less than Beautiful to me It seems like my eyes have been transfigured Something deep inside has changed They've been open wide, but hold that trigger This could mean Danger I'm falling in love, falling in love Falling in love I'm falling in love, falling in love Falling in love With Hermione Granger What What the hell is this? You expect me to sing about her? I don't care about her It's just a little make up Draco wake up! I'm mistaken She is the hottest girl I've ever seen! Now, because she's like a girl I've never seen Don't know why I'd ever be so mean This could mean Danger I'm falling in love, falling in love Falling in love I could be Falling in love, falling in love Falling in love With Hermione Granger Ron: I want to let her know Draco: I feel so queasy Ron: I want to let her know But I can't let it show Ron: She'd laugh! Poor Weasley But I can't let it show Draco: Come on Ron: Come on Ron! Draco! Draco: You gotta let it go! Ron: You gotta let it go! You gotta let it go! What? THE HELL IS THIS? Ron: How a dress can take a mess Ron: Make her nothing less than Granger! Ron: Make her nothing less than Wake up! Ron: Make her nothing less than Ron: Make her nothing less than Draco: I've been mistaken! Ron: Beautiful to me... Draco: I've been mistaken! Draco: She is the hottest girl I've ever seen! Ron: It seems like my eyes have been transfigured Draco: She is the hottest girl I've ever seen! Now because she's like a girl I've never seen Ron: Something deep inside has changed Now because she's like a girl I've never seen Draco: Don't know why Ron: They've been open wide but hold that trigger Draco: Don't know why I'd ever be so mean Ron: They've been open wide but hold that trigger This could mean Danger I'm falling in love, falling in love Falling in love I could be falling in love Falling in love Falling in love With Hermione Granger With Hermione Granger With Hermione Granger Danger Ron: Oh my God Ah I can't believe it What? I just can't- I can't believe she is dancing with every guy but me. That is so- That is so stupid That is stupid... W-Why do you- Why do you even care, man? I don't! I-I don't care I don't care and that's what I'm gonna go up and tell her I'm gonna go and say "I don't care what you do" And she's gonna feel so damn stupid She is gonna feel like such an idiot Listen Ron, you're acting like a real jerk Maybe you should take it easy on the butterbeer No No Hermione: Hey guys Hey Hermione, hey you look great. You look wonderful Oh thanks, yeah You know I used to think looks weren't important and now I think they're more important than anything Oh it's just I'm having so much fun dancing with everyone Ron: Wow- wow Hermione When did you become so shallow? When? What is wrong with you, Ron? Nothing Nothing's wrong with me But why don't you just go ask Schlongbottom to dance, huh? Ron: Go do it You know what? Maybe I will I showed her. I showed her so good Harry: Wait a second Wait a hot second I know what's going on here! You've got a crush! Alright, Ron Listen, listen to me now Just a little advice Just call me crazy, but girls don't really like it when you're angry at them, much less you shout at them Now maybe what you should do is go over there and tell her how much you care about her Okay? Maybe you should ask her to dance What? No! No! 'Cause then she'd know that I liked her And you always know that you don't tell a girl that you like her because it makes you look like an idiot I know you'll look like an idiot Anytime you tell a girl you like her, it makes you look dumb That's inevitable But listen, it's something you have to do Ron, you have to move forward so that everyone will like you back Okay? And what have we got to lose? We look like idiots anyway. We're here's one. Look at our robes You know, if we dressed like this in the muggle world We would get our asses kicked You have nothing to lose. Absolutely nothing I bet, you know She probably wants to dance with you just as much as you want to dance with her You just gotta You just gotta, give it a a chance Maybe there's something that you didn't see before, you know You just gotta go and maybe find something special and through the whole time you just didn't really have the guts to Say anything Where are you going? Where are you going? I'm still mad and sad Hold on HP's gonna take his own advice, pal Hey Ginny Oh Hey, Harry Can I sit down? Um, yeah, sure Sooo How's Hogwarts?

Well it seems clear to me now that that punch ladle was a portkey And now, thanks to you, We've both been transported to some mystery location Brilliant Cedric, well you're a Hufflepuff Why don't you find a way out of this place, okay? Harry, I think I found something! It appears to be a headstone We must be in some sort of graveyard Tom Riddle, Mary Riddle, Thoms Riddle Riddle me this, eh Potter? Cedric, I don't know about this place. I think we gotta get out of here Harry, you're a Gryffindor. Where's your sense of adventure? God- Cedric You are so annoying, okay?

So many regrets I dead! Harry: Oh my wizard God! Not so fast! Petrificus Totalus! Harry: Professor Quirrell, you just killed Cedric! Not I, Potter But perhaps you'd like to see who did He's dying to see you Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived It's good to see you again The cauldron is ready, my lord Harry: Cauldron?

Ooh Aaaahaha Wooho Okay haaha Stop struggling! Detention, Potter! Harry: Detention? Jeez, this guy is almost as big of an asshole as Snape is Quirrell: It worked! When I was a boy... An orphan boy I'd love to move my feet I'd hear a tune And start to swoon My life would seem complete The other boys would laugh and jeer But I'd catch 'em tapping their toes And when I'd start to sway They'd get carried away And oh, how the feeling grows I take my Foot My little foot And with that foot Oh how I'd start to shake I take two feet Two tiny feet Hey look!

Voldemort: Yes Bellatrix: My Dark Lord... You look fabulous Bellatrix Lestrange Bellatrix: Oh, my liege! Tell me it's going to be like the old days when we do nothing but torture, murder, and make love? Ah, the old days are back, baby! I can't tell you what it was like without you Well I'm never going again 'Cause I've conquered death and my first pleasure will be to kill Harry Potter And next to take over the Ministry of Magic And rule the world For all time! And you will my Lord, but not yet For now we must stick to the plan We blame Potter's murder on Quirrell So that your return may remain a secret The Death Eaters aren't prepared to take on the entire Ministry of Magic much less Dumbledore, and the Order of the Phoenix Quirrell: I'm sorry What was that about me going to Azkaban for Potter's murder? Ohoho, you shall refer to him as My Lord, my liege, or my Dark Lord only! No no no Bellatrix, it's a- it's cool Quirrell's cool, Quirrell's cool, he's... Over the last year he's proven himself to be a very good fr- A very good servant to the will of the Dark Lord Quirrell: Oh I see, so- So you're Thomas Jefferson and I'm your Sally Hemings, is that right? No No, Quirrell, that- That came out wrong It's not like that Isn't it? Ugh, silence slave Crucio! Voldemort: It's alright, it's What's the matter? He is your pawn! You are his queen It is an honor to serve the Dark Lord, no matter what the task! Are you all right? Did you really know the whole time, you'd- blame Potter's murder on me? Yes... yes I I knew But things have changed over the last year, I feel different now- Don't touch me How do I explain this? It's- It's like that movie She's All That You remember? We watched that together You remember how at the end Freddie Prinze Jr. turns out to be good? Quirrell: No I didn't see the end because you were watching it while you were on the back of my head sucking my soul! Well I wish there was another way But I've got to take over the world Quirrell: Well there is I'll let you know now but it's gonna be pretty hard to make that rollerblading date from Azkaban Bellatrix: Death Eaters, take him away And now you have what you've waited for for so long What? Your chance to kill Harry Potter Yes Kill Potter! Ha- whoa, where'd he go? Harry: You're not killing me today Voldemort, but I'll tell you what I'll get you some punch! Portkey! Portkey! Portkey! Portkey! Ginny: Oh my Rowling What happened Harry Potter? You... Harry what the hell are you doing over here? You missed the raffle Snape: What happened to the graveyard? It's- it's Voldemort! It's Voldemort! He's back! Extra! Extra! Read all about it Harry Potter, the boy who beat Voldemort now says he's back! Daily Prophet! Get your Daily Prophet here! Harry Potter versus Voldemort, round two! Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge makes a statement Cornelius: I've heard these Voldemort rumors and I for one simply don't believe it Voldemort talks about it on his new FlooTube channel! I'm gonna find Harry Potter and I'm gonna *** in his ***! Also does reviews of "17 Again" Well it was a little slow in the beginning, but Come on, Zac Efron Zefron! Enough said I've seen these so-called posts and I still don't believe it This is a ruse You all have been hoodwinked! Professor Quirrell confesses to murder of Hogwarts student Cedric Diggory Receives life in Azkaban Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Extra! Harry: Man... Ron, this totally sucks man. This- Ron: This is horrible Yeah I know I mean, look at this This is... it's terrible Harry Potter versus Voldemort: The Fight of the Century Ron: No it's not that Harry Potter versus Voldemort: The Fight of the Century Ron: No it's not that It's Hermione It's just like I can't get her out of my head, and everytime I look at her I have these pains in my chest, and I just know it's her fault That bitch I'm just not cut out for this, Harry. I'm not Yeah man I know what you mean It's like when you're trying to save the world, and the whole world is just against you No, no, no, no, no! This isn't about you Why does every conversation we have to have have to turn into Potter talk? It's not Potter talk- No! No! I'm miserable And all you can do is talk about yourself You're the like the self absorbed guy I know. If you were miserable, I'd be there for you, but you won't even listen to me and I'm sick of it So- so, so good luck with whatever you were talking about And I hope that you and Voldemort live happily ever after 'Cause me I am never going to be happy again So I'm just gonna go curl up in my sock drawer and sleep for days Harry: Ron... Hermione: Were you just talking to Ron? Yeah I was trying to tell him about Voldemort Hermione: Well did he say anything about me? Yeah I was trying to tell him about Voldemort Hermione: Well did he say anything about me? Harry: Uh, yeah, he said that someone told me Well, was one of them an apology for how he treated me at the Yule Ball? Um, yeah I heard about that Listen, I was wondering maybe if you heard about a little something I don't know, that uh, Voldemort is back! Uh, Cedric Diggory is dead! Professor Quirrell was crazy, Cho: Oh! Professor Quirrell was crazy, And now I have to save the world. Did you hear that Hermione? Um, actually I have heard those things, Harry, about a thousand times but never had they been told to me with so much sass Drop the attitude Harry Potter You are acting like Garfield on a Monday Well don't you think I have a right to be a little stressed out? Wh- no. No I don't You know what, this is just like with the dragon, okay? I stressed out, I told you to prepare and yet you didn't do anything, and you were fine You know you just played your little guitar I mean, and I don't know what you're crying about, Harry This is just like when you defeated Voldemort and you were a baby Hermione, come on You're the friend that's supposed to tell me to go to the library and try to figure this stuff out- Well you know what, Harry? I don't do that anymore Draco: Read it and weep, Potter! I heard Voldemort's back And he's trying to kill you. What do you think about that, Moonshoes? Malfoy, I honestly see- I don't see why you're so happy about this If Voldemort is back, which he is, You might as well kiss Hogwarts goodbye You might as well kiss the whole planet goodbye Kiss the planet goodbye? Having second thoughts about Pigfarts, are you? Malfoy you're the last person I want to talk to now, okay? You know what? As soon as you're out of the way I'll be the coolest kid in school Hermione: Malfoy, that will never happen. Everybody hates you Oh right, okay, this coming from Hermione Stranger Pansy: She's right, Malfoy. She's cooler than you Cho: Yeah, even Moaning Myrtle is cooler than you Neville: Take this! Expelliarmus! No! Ignore it! Ignore it Don't say anything! Stop it! Snape: What the devil is going on here? Draco Malfoy pull those trousers up at once Professor I just- I don't want to hear it I need to see you in my office Now This is all your fault, Potter! You'll pay for this You'll all pay! Harry: Nice. you're the man Cho: That made me feel better Harry: Hey Ginny what's up- Hey, I hope you have something to say about Voldemort Ginny: Who? Harry: Whatever No, I'm fine Um Hey, Harry? Yeah? Um, so We kissed at the Yule Ball? And, well, I thought we were gonna be together forever but we're not Yeah, that uh pretty much sums it up Hey, what's going on? Ginny, this is what's going on. Don't you get it? Everyone is in danger who's near to me We can't be together because Well Voldemort is back, which he is, then You're in mortal peril. Don't you get it? It's just like the Spiderman movie. Haven't you seen that? MJ and Peter Parker can't be together But the whole point of Spiderman 2 was that MJ and Peter Parker could be together and Yeah I know, but the point of Spiderman 3 is that everything sucks and that falls to shit! Ginny, what I'm trying to say is I don't want my life to be like Spiderman 3 I hated that movie Ugh, I'm sorry. It's just That's my little way of saying, well We can't be together I'm sorry Ginny I'm such an idiot Ugh, I need a- I need a butterbeer Hey! Psst, Potter! Hey! It's me Harry: Who're you? It's Dumbledore Harry: Oh Listen, listen Harry I've got some very important things I gotta tell you What? Oh about Voldemort? Yes! Things that that are absolutely crucial for you to know but I can't get into it right now I need you to meet in my inner office at 10 o'clock and come by yourself Bring that uh, Invisibility Cloak of yours and don't go blabbing your mouth about this to anybody Voldemort has spies that can be anywhere. Even inside of Hogwarts From now on the only person you can trust Harry, is me and Severus Snape Listen, Dumbledore, I know you don't want to hear this, but I am not so sure about Snape I think, I think- You know I'm pretty sure he's working for Voldemort What? That's stupid. You're stupid! No, no, no I'm actually- I'm positive That night in the graveyard some Death Eater cuts off his hand and Snape shows up without a hand Dumbledore: Oh cockamamie! Snape has assured me that he lost his hand in an entirely unrelated incident Dumbledore, why do you trust Snape so much? Because I love him Professor, I- Hey, I don't want to hear anything else about it There is no way that Severus Snape is, was, or ever shall be A servant of Voldemort's All hail Voldemort! Severus Snape, what are you doing here? Got tired of being on Dumbledore's lap? I ought to Jelly-legs Jinx you right now, traitor Don't be goofy with me I need to see Voldemort How do we know this isn't some Order of the Phoenix practical joke? I thought you deserted the Death Eaters when the Dark Lord lost his body Or were you always a spy for Dumblebore? Slumbersnore Bumblesore! I heard you had your Dark Mark laser surgically removed Oh, well if you two know so much about me, you should write a biography Snape: The Double Agent That's right I've always been a servant of Voldemort I've simply been working undercover, finding out valuable information such as The inner workings of Hogwarts The roster of the Order of the Phoenix and finding out what a true Hufflepuff is anyway I've seen things no Slytherin should see So if you're done putting each other's feet in each other's mouths I would like to see my master Of course. Right away, Severus Good! I'll be in the drawing room Painting a picture of the stupid looks on your faces Then, after sneaking into the Department of Mysteries We'll enchant the- Excuse me Whoa! Whoa Whoa-ho-ho, excuse me I was in the middle of plotting Where was I? The statues will occupy the guards in the main lobby while you and I sneak into the Minister's office where you will be one Killing Curse away from complete control of the entire Wizarding world! How does that sound, my Lord? My Lord? Voldemort? Ahh yeah! Gringotts, that's great that's great Polyjuice potion, always very classy I'm sorry what are we talking about? Did you hear anything of my evil plan? Well um The details are a little fuzzy, but uh but you did have a very evil tone He's all yours Wh- no, what abo- but Bellatrix, come back No it's! Aw, co- don't be like this Aww... Now two people are mad at me What? Sir, Severus Snape is at the door and importunes access to you Severus Snape? See him in Is that a new body, my Lord? You look absolutely ravishing Severus For such a super secret spy, you're a terrible liar I'm a wreck Better have some good news My Lord, you know how for years we've been trying to get Death Eaters into the grounds at Hogwarts? For years we've been trying to sneak Death Eaters onto the grounds of Hogwarts Well I think I've finally discovered a way how Well by all means, Snape, tell me I can't Can't? Tease! Why not? I made an Unbreakable Vow not to let any Death Eaters in Unbreakable Vows, I hate those I know, but I had to do it in order to convince Dumbledore of my loyalty Yes Snape, I understand Well if you can't help me, what do you propose we do? Well I can't tell you but I've brought along someone who can Draco: All hail Lord Voldemort Lucius Malloy's boy? Voldemort: Are you serious? Draco: Malfoy Voldemort: Are you serious? Voldemort: Are you serious? Malfoy Voldemort: Are you serious? Help from a child, you've got to be kidding me Don't make me laugh I'm pissing If this homemade Dark Mark won't convince you Then at least hear me out Okay Okay Okay, how do you propose you get my Death Eaters into your little daycare center And don't- and don't suggest a giant slide or a trampoline because we've already tried those The vents Your Death Eaters shall enter through the ventilation system of Hogwarts Duh! The vents! How do we find these vents? Oh I'll tell you how to get to the vents But first We discuss the subject of payment Ah, the catch There's always a catch There's nothing in this world so cruel and demanding as the soul of a child What do you want, Malloy? I want a galaxy traversing rocketship with enough fuel to get me to Mars What do you want with a rocketship? What business do you have on Mars? Well, let's just say Pigfarts, Pigfarts, here I come Pigfarts, Pigfarts, yum yum yum No no no no with all my respect, my Lord There's one tiny flaw in that flawless plan Albus Dumbledore You're right, Snape Normally I'd say, "I'll kill him," but I I haven't been feeling so evil lately So here's how it's gonna break down, Milfoy I need your guarantee That you'll lead my Death Eaters into Hogwarts I will simultaneously be attacking the Ministry of Magic Now I need you to promise that by the end of the siege of Hogwarts Dumbledore will be dead Leave Harry Potter for me But Dumbledore... must die Do we have a deal? We shall shake on it An Unbreakable Vow I don't- By the end of tomorrow night, Albus Dumbledore will be dead? Yes And I'll have my rocketship? When the technology is available And you'll have to be my slave for a whole day starting now! No! You little shit! You got me! You've got me! Ohh That is so embarrassing! That's the second time that that's happened! That's why I hate Unbreakable Curses There are so many things I'm going to have you do for me You're going to clean my room, and lay out my knickers, and you're going to tape Wizards of Waverly Place for me! I hate chores! I'll be busy with a murder Sometimes- Hermione: Harry, why would Dumbledore want to meet us so late at night? Harry: Well he's got some information to tell us about Voldemort Did you bring the Invisibility Cloak? I've got it right here Ron: Alright Harry, this better be good I don't have a snack, and I'm missing Wizards of Waverly Place for this, okay? So what do we have to do that's so damn- Oh my God, thank you Ron: I love Hogwarts Hogwarts is amazing Ron: You want one? Harry: Yeah You know what? I am leaving Whoa no no no no no you're not No you're not. Okay when I said I needed your help I meant both of you, so you guys gotta get over these hurt feelings before somebody gets hurt, okay? So come on Hello Harry Oh God dammit I told you to come by yourself. Why did you have to bring the fatties? Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione are my best friends They're my best friends, and if this information is as important as you say it is They have a right to hear it Well I've been wrong before Get in here hot legs I was talking to Weasley Thanks? Sorry the place is such a sty Oh my God! That is a boss Zefron poster Harry: It's awesome Just the greatest You know in every interview I've ever seen him, he just seems like such a Charismatic uh, humanitarian You think you like him? Wrong, because I love him the most Harry Potter loves Zac Efron more than anybody else in the planet Ron: He does, that's- that's true Anyway, no! That's not what we're here to talk about We're talking about Voldemort Harry is right. Not necessarily about Zefron Everybody knows that I like him the most, but uh About the Dark Lord If you, uh, were to defeat this guy You're going to have to know about Horcruxes Okay. What's um What's a Horcrux What is a Horcrux? Horcrux is one of the most terrifying pieces of magic that a wizard can create. It's- actually when a wizard takes a piece of his soul and puts it into something else Why would anybody ever want to do that? Harry, if you have a Horcrux you can never truly die Your body can be dead but your soul can live on Oh, it makes sense now, Harry Everyone knows that the night your parents were killed, Voldemort was destroyed but somehow he survived! He must have had a Horcrux! He didn't just have one Horcrux, He had six of them! I've already killed the first five for you, so don't worry about that But you guys have to find the last one with this The sword of Godric Gryffindor! That's right Godric Gryffindor was one of the four founders of Hogwarts If anything can destroy a Horcrux, that sword is it This thing is so damn awesome Oh my God. Every wizard should have a sword! Not these stupid drum sticks Forget about them! Yah! Yah! Okay, you know what Dumbledore? So we know what a Horcrux is, that's all well and good But how can we find one? Where are they? Where's the last one? We find them with this Oh! Looks like... Looks like G-Unit bling, but it is actually a Horcrux-seeking medallion Wait, that's a Horcrux-seeking medallion? I don't- That sounds a little too convenient Oh so you have problems with the Time Turner but not the Horcrux-seeking medallion? Wait, so if he has this piece of bling, then why are Ron and I even here? Yeah Voldemort isn't any of our business Hermione Granger When one of you's has got a problem, that means all three of you's has gots a problem What would Zac Efron say at a time like this? We're all in this together! Anyway, you just gotta, you gotta find the Horcruxes and you gotta destroy them, that's the only way to beat the- What is in that- Guests, oh! It must be the Death Eaters! They're coming to kill me! Kids, get your beards on Wh- we don't have any beards! I thought I told you to bring beards We have an Invisibility Cloak Oh well put that on, it's not a beard Hey, are you Dumbledore? Oh no no no, you see I've got this beard on Well have you seen him? Oh, I thought I saw someone over there by that bureau but I could have just been imagining what it was that I looked like without this beard on Alright everybody spread out and look for Dumbledore He's gotta be around here somewhere Be careful with the Zac Efron poster, it's an antique Why do you care so much about Zefron? I just appreciate his charms and hair Harry: Yeah but everybody knows that I like him the best Ron: Oh my God shut up What the hell was that? Ron: Oh my God shut up I wish that I could say that, it was me because I feel that I love Zefron the most But it was definitely a voice from within this room Is it an invisible man? Could the predator be in the room? Begin invisible man search! Alright, it's me! It's Dumbledore Dumbledore, where'd you come from? The man with the beard turned me in Now we've got you right where we want you Yes, but what I don't understand is how We had the help of a man on the inside Someone you trusted Someone you may have even loved Slughorn? Lockheart? Aberforth, my brother? No It was me Malfoy, you little shit! That's right Dumbledore I betrayed everyone And now I'm going to kill you Oh no you're not. Draco, If you were gonna kill me you would have done so already No! No, no Not necessarily true! I just wanted to offer you one more game of Connect Four before I offed you Draco, there are other options You know it is time you looked inside yourself and figured out what it is that you really want I want Hermione Granger! and a rocketship Well why didn't you just take the girl out for a Happy Meal? Go to space camp, come on Murder leads to a life of despair and desperation I know you're gonna do the right thing, hey? Atta boy What the devil is going on here? Dumbledore: Severus, thank you What the devil is going on here? Dumbledore: Severus, thank you We've got Dumbledore cornered Well, what are we waiting for? Kill him! Do it, Draco! I don't think I can Coward! Ten points from Gryffindor! I don't understand I gave you my letterman's jacket It never fit Oh God! Why didn't you tell me? I could have shrunk it with magic Severus, please don't kill me! Avada Kedavra! Harry: I hate Snape! I hate Snape! I hate Snape. I hate him I'm gonna kill him Hermione: It's not your fault, Harry No it is my fault, don't you get it? Everybody's dying because of me First Cedric, now Dumbledore I can't do it anymore Ron: Come on, let's go to The Burrow. Come on! No don't you get it? I have to do this by myself I did it once when I was a baby I can't have you guys be near me. You're too much at risk Hermione: N-no, we don't care about the risk! No you don't understand. You- You have to get away from me Ron: You can't mean that I do! Just leave me alone! Cornelius Fudge! The Minister of Magic I still don't believe you're back Believe this Fudge! Avada Kedavra! A heart attack. Surely! Yes! Yes! The Ministry has fallen! Yes! Now you're the Minister Nay, the king of all magic! Oh, Voldemort Take me right here Right now, right here on the Minister's desk I'm gonna getcha I'm gonna getcha! Come here, Trixy! Oh, wait You wanna try something new? Oh, so new! Get on the desk Now sit up, Bitch Yes, command me, my Lord That's nice So what do we do now? Anything we want Hang out mostly We could watch a movie How's about "She's All That"? I've never seen the beginning of it Are you feeling okay, my Lord? Of course I am, Quirrell Alright, that's the dozenth time you've called me that! No, I uh I called you a squirrel I-I... called you a squirrel No. You're thinking on that peon we sent to Azkaban He's not a peon He's more a man than you'll ever be I can't do this If I'm going to be evil with all of you, I need to be evil with all of you Evil with all of me? Wh- What does that mean? I know I'm right here No There are pieces of you missing Are you talking about my Horcruxes? 'Cause- 'cause if it If it weren't for those I wouldn't even be here right now! I can't remember Dad And I can't remember Mom Aunts and uncles aren't quite the same But I had him And life seemed fair Yes I had him He was there To give me strength, show concern Ask for nothing in return Say hello, talk me though Do the things that fathers should do And I'm missing you I'm just missing you There it is. He's gone And he's hung me out to dry The joy he said he felt, well I guess it was a lie But when I had him My life was fine When I had him He was mine He'd share his thoughts, be a friend Stick with me until the end Watch a movie, rollerskate Fill the world with fear and hate And I'm missing you I'm just missing you Now I'm all alone Now you're gone for good Now I'm stuck right here Wishing I understood You gave me hope when my spells weren't right You gave me someone to hold every night And I'm missing you Harry: I'm just missing you And I'm missing you Harry: I'm just missing you Quirrell: And I'm missing you Harry: I'm just missing you Quirrell: And I'm missing you I'm just missing you Quirrell: And I'm missing you I'm just missing you My Dark Lord, news from Severus Snape Dumbledore is dead and the dementors have control of the castle Hogwarts is yours, my Dark Lord! Excellent! Prepare my flying machine! Looks like I'm going back to Hogwarts! Ginny: Harry! Ginny, what are you doing here? Get out of here! No there's no place to go! The Death Eaters are all over the castle I know and they're looking for me and if they find me, they're gonna be with me Y-you're gonna, you're gonna get in trouble! Get out of here Well what are you gonna do? I don't know Ginny, I'm not cut out for this kind of thing Well no you have to do something. I don't know what you can do but you can do it! You're Harry Potter No! You're the Boy Who Lived! No Ginny, you don't get it! None of you guys get it, I- I'm just a twelve year old kid Ginny I'm sorry but I'm alone It's hopeless, right? I've been alone Surrounded by darkness And I've seen how heartless The world... can be And I've seen you crying You felt like it's hopeless And I'll always do my best To make... you see 'Cause Harry, you're not alone 'Cause you're here with me And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cause nothing can Keep me from loving you And you know it's true It don't matter what'll come to be Our love is all we need to make it through Now I know it ain't easy Harry: Know it ain't easy But it ain't hard trying Harry: So hard trying But it ain't hard trying Harry: So hard trying Everytime I see you smiling And I feel you so close to me Tell me 'Cause baby you're not alone 'Cause you're here with me And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cause nothing can Keep me from loving you And you know it's true It don't matter what'll come to be Our love is all we need to make it through Well I still have trouble I trip and stumble, trying to Make sense of things sometimes I look for reasons But I don't need them All I need is to look in your eyes And I realize Ron: Hey Harry Baby you're not alone 'Cause you're here with me And nothing's ever gonna take us down 'Cause nothing can keep me from loving you Harry: Loving you And you know it's true Harry: Loving you And you know it's true It don't matter what'll come to be Our love is all we need to make it through Guys I'm so glad you came back. I'm sorry I shouted 'Cause it don't matter what'll come to be Our love is all we need Ron: To make it To make To make To make it Through Alright now that we've got that four part harmony out of the way Why don't we go for that Horcrux? Yeah let's do it Well It could be anywhere If I had a Horcrux I would drop it in the bottom of the ocean Or I would put it in a pyramid with King Tut and all of his jewels Or I would blast it into space with a monkey who knew nothing about Horcruxes Or it could be hidden somewhere around the mundane British countryside Our search could entail months of depressing camping, breaking into Gringotts, and drinking boatloads of Polyjuice Potion Well the medallion says that dumb, so we're not gonna do that But it does say that it's in one convenient place Get this, Hogwarts. Wouldn't you know it? That's awesome. I love Hogwarts Harry: What's even better It's in Dumbledore's office! Oh, bitchin' Hermione: Awesome! Oh, bitchin' So let's go. Oh wait a second, wait a second Hold the phone, how did you get here? The Death Eaters are all over Hogwarts I had help From who? Oh he's over here Malfoy! Oh, no, no, no, no. He's really nice now Um, I just wanted to say that song you guys sang was really beautiful And um, while- while I was backstage I was, um, working on my harmonizing And I thought, um, maybe I could- maybe I could join you but ya- Wrapped it up before I could chime in there Maybe if you uh, if you do a reprise I could have a little go at it So, um, but as- as Ginny said I'm really nice now And I just feel awful about what happened But I mean Could you argue that this was my fault? Ron: Yes, all- Harry: Absolutely, you're an asshole all the time Hermione: Yes, yes Harry: Absolutely, you're an asshole all the time Yeah, that would be a safe argument Uh, but Let me ask you one question Do you think... I'm happy about this? Oh my God Malfoy Just because you're upset doesn't mean you're off the hook Harry: Yeah, and further more Do you want to kick your own ass or should we do it for you? Ron: Yeah Oh, uh Well I guess if you're giving me the option I'll...

That is a coral snake And a coral snake is a highly poisonous snake Snape: Potter, she's right And a coral snake is a highly poisonous snake Snape: Potter, she's right It's too late for me now Before I go, I need to tell you There is another Horcrux How can that be? All six have been destroyed No, no there's a seventh I really hope it's not an Ashley Tisdale poster. I can't do that Take the medallion Doesn't say anything But give it to Granger Wait but... it says there's one right here but I don't understand Yeah Harry, the night Voldemort killed your parents He tried to destroy you but his body was destroyed instead When that happened, a part of his soul was blasted away from the whole And attached itself... to you Voldemort can never truly die until all the Horcruxes have been destroyed But if... if Harry's a Horcrux, I mean, does Harry have to be destroyed? There's got to be another way No, Potter. I'll show you what you need to do Watch very carefully He... he didn't even do anything That's cause he's dead you dumb mother- People of Hogwarts My Death Eaters have taken the castle And your headmaster, Albus Dumbledore... he's dead Continue to resist, and you will all be killed one by one But... there need not be war between us You all fought so valiantly And I'm willing to offer you positions in my new world order as my slaves Give up now and be forgiven I command my Death Eaters to stand down Now, Harry Potter. I speak directly to you You do not wish for those closest to you to continue to suffer and die on your behalf You will come face me yourself I will be waiting for you in the Forbidden Forest for one hour At the end of that hour you have not come to face me, have not- turned yourself in... The battle recommences This time, Potter, I shall enter the frame myself And I will find you And I will murder every last man, women, and child Who has tried to conceal you from me Voldemort out, bitches Alright guys don't worry. We- we still have an hour Okay? We just need to come up with a plan No, there's- there's no plan Hermione. I know what I have to do. I- I have to die No no no no there's got to be another way Well, m-maybe there's something, uh Maybe there's something in this book You know we- we could find some sort of enchantment that will nullify- No, no forget about it. There- There's only one thing to do I have to die I love you all Except you Draco, I can't *** stand you Goodbye Ginny: Harry... Ron: Harry! Ginny: Harry... He's not coming, my Lord It seems that way Well Death Eaters Looks like we're going back to seize the castle This is what Potter has chosen It's funny I... I expected him to I expected him to come It seems I was mistaken Harry: You weren't! Harry Potter! The Boy Who Lived Crucio! Ow... Crucio! You're not even going to fight back You're weak Weak Just like your... Parents They did not deserve to live in this world In my world! Prepare to join them Prepare To die Avada Kedavra! Voldy! Voldy! You've done it my Lord. Potter is dead! No one shall ever question your powers again! Yes Doesn't this please you my Lord? Yeah Yeah it's great, it's great I just thought it might make me feel less empty inside Well Death Eaters We go back to Hogwarts to tell them of what has become of their Hero Dumbledore: Hey Harry Harry: Whoa! Dumbledore, wha-? What are you doing here? What am- where am I? I thought I was dead. I got shot by Voldemort Let's just say you're somewhere between our world and the next What? Did I survive? What... what happened? Wouldn't be the first time, Potter Take a seat Alright Harry Have you ever heard of a lo- Sit down! Have you ever heard of a love shield? Uh... no but it sounds kind of Kind of fruity A love shield is anything but fruity It's when somebody loves you so much that if they were ever willing to give their live for you That love literally becomes a shield that surrounds your body To protect you from any form of Dark Magic So is that what just happened to me? I have a love shield? Harry, it's time for you to learn all the things you should have known seven years ago Which really would have helped you along the way The love shield protected you the first time, uh Voldemort accidentally turned you into the seventh Horcrux The one that not even he knew about. Uh... Exactly, and when Voldemort tried killing you this time He was actually unknowingly killing the piece of himself inside of you Uh, and I've known the whole time You knew this whole time? You bastard Hey, hey You knew this whole time? You bastard Hey, hey They don't call me the greatest wizard who ever lived for nothing Harry, it is time for you to get your cute little butt back there and fight him as a mortal man Except this time, he will be a mortal man too Dumbledore, I get what you're saying. I know what I have to do Good boy, good boy Hey, before I go... um So you're clairvoyant now, right? You can see the past, the present, and the future all the same time? Oh yeah You can see the past, the present, and the future all the same time? Can you tell me how Lost ends? Harry, there are some questions that even I can't answer Thanks man Hey, no problem. Get out of here Third door on your left, yeah Are you ready to go Dumbledore? Sure am, Rumbleroar! And you're sure you don't want to let Harry Potter know that you're really still alive? Ahh no Pigfarts has been a closely guarded secret for thousands of years It'd be a shame to let the cat out of the bag No pun intended I supposed you're right Do you have your spacesuit, Dumbledore? Oh! Thank you for reminding me! Ready to go, Rumby? I sure am To Pigfarts! Rumbleroar! People of Hogwarts It's me Harry Potter... is dead He was killed while running away, trying to save himself While you laid down your lives for him The battle is won!

Never gave up the fight Harry stood up for what is right Well now it's our turn Our turn! Make a joyful sound Voldemort is going down! Yah! Come on! Come on guys! Get in a line! We must unite so we can fight Turn the battle around! Time's running out. It's time to shout Voldemort is going down! Can't you feel a fire burning?

We must unite so we can fight Turn the battle around! Time's running out. It's time to shout Voldemort is going down! Guys I'm alive! Ron: You're back!

Voldemort is going... We must unite, so we can fight Voldemort is going... Voldemort is going down! Cho! No, no no no it's cool. We barricaded it It's alright. He can't get in. We barricaded the two doors and it's fine It's impossible. It's impossible. Don't worry about it- Avada Kedavra! What!? Potter!? How many times do I have to kill you, boy? Clearly more than once But it's all over Voldemort, 'cause you can't kill me this time Nobody help me. I gotta do this by myself He doesn't mean that! It's not how he operates, is it boy? Who you gonna use as a human shield this time, Potter? Harry: Don't- Hermione: Ron! Harry: Don't- Ron: Oh Nobody! Because this time it's just you and me Because all the Horcruxes are gone. I destroyed them all What? Even my Zefron poster!? Especially the Zefron poster! No! Curse you, Potter! You'll die for that! No! I won't, I won't Because you can't kill me, and you can't kill any of these people What the **** you on about? You don't learn from your mistakes, do you Voldemort? I was prepared to die to save these people But you didn't! Yes, but I meant to And that's what did it I've done what my mother did for me for these people I've given them magical sanctuary so you can't hurt me Or these people ever again! So what? Who cares about these children? It's you I want dead, Potter What's to stop you from dying when I strike? Just one thing Think about all the people you've hurt, Voldemort All the lives you've destroyed All the people you've killed Okay? Maybe try a little slice of remorse pie What? There's got to be one person... one thing in your life that you miss You regret Well, maybe there's one I... No! There isn't! The joke's on you, Potter! I don't care about anybody! I know And that's what makes you such a piece of shit 'Cause here at Hogwarts we all stick together We love one another. We're friends My love's protected these guys And their love is all I need to protect me from you Let's put that theory to the test, Potter Avada Kedavra! Harry: Expelliarmus! Cho: Well chocolate frogs! Harry Potter did it, y'all! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa whoa whoa Listen, Harry What? Just wanna let you guys know, um That I'm totally cool with it. Go on Go, make out with him. Come on. Make out with me Guys, I mean, I guess that about ties up all the loose ends! Yeah! Everything's cool! Oh! Except for the House Cup Tournament Neville: Kids! Kids, look at this I found Dumbledore's will Harry: Dumbledore's will? It says in the event of my death, Gryffindor wins the House Cup! It also says that Hogwarts goes to Harry Potter My chocolate factory goes to Charlie And Toontown goes to the Toons! Hey guys, well I guess all the professors are dead, so Butterbeer's on me! Free to go Quirrell: Thank you Dementor: You know While I was devouring every single one of your happy thoughts They all seem to be about a certain friend of yours Care to talk? No, no that's behind me now Sorry Well did you hear the news? Voldemort is dead! Yeah, good luck getting off this impenetrable island Dead!? Hey you Voldemort is it... is it really you? What's left of me But I just heard that you were- Destroyed Yeah But Quirrell there's There's part of me... that's still here And I can't go on to the next plane without it It's a part of me that can't be destroyed Because it's right in... Here In my heart? So you came back? I came home And you don't want to kill Harry Potter anymore? No... No Because I learned something when I had my body back, Quirrell I learned that life is really messy ...complicated and And it doesn't turn out the way that you think it will And that- you- You think killing people might make them like you but it doesn't It just makes people dead I got ki- I got killed by a two year old! And it's really embarrassing, and everyone says "When you gonna come back Voldemort?" "When you gonna take over the world?" And it's on me! It's all on me! And I'm sitting there by myself 'cause no one wants to help And I say to myself Maybe with Quirrell things would be okay Is okay good? Quirrell Okay is wonderful Baby you're not alone 'Cause you're here with me And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cause nothing can Keep me from loving you And you know it's true It don't matter what'll come to be Our love is all we need to make it through
