[music playing] [distant sirens] Kegs, Vernon, you guys cool? Yeah, we're both bored as hell, but still breathing. What is it? Did the spies go on strike today? Come on, Kegs. What's the scoop on this guy? He always this late? Well, you know, the same old, same old. Hold on. We're on. The suspect is moving. Yeah. What is it? A little boy? Here's the briefcase. Let's rock and roll. Show time. Take care of it. What the hell is this? Excuse me, sir. Federal agents. Sir, you're going to have to come with us. This is an outrage. I'm with the Shinsu embassy. Save it for the judge, Mr. Chan. Forget it. It's empty. Right again, Maddox. Baby carriage. Hey, buddy! Excuse me, ma'am. Oh, dear. I'm sorry. Can we talk to you for a second? [baby crying] [gunshot] [grunting] Drop it, tootsie. Hey, the baby. Yeah, I got it. Hey, back up. Back up, buddy. Federal agent. Federal agent. Back up. [laugh] [explosion] [laughter] [grunting] Over here. [explosion on tv] Apparently these people mean business, and it's costing us American lives. This so-called international militant cult is just humiliating every agency in DC. And it doesn't look good for anybody when a federal courthouse blows up on the evening news, especially the president. The boys down in intelligence have now decided that this isn't just a bunch of kooks with shaved heads. We're looking at a well-organized group of terrorists right here at home, very similar to the Japanese cult that unleashed the poisonous gas on the Tokyo subway. Last week we finally caught a break. ComTail intercepted a call, giving us the names of the leaders. There are five of them. They're all in Southern California. We're not going to make the same mistake the FBI did in Waco by going full deployment. So this time we're taking a different approach, going smaller, so to speak. We've decided to send you into the field to track them down, making as little noise as possible. You'll meet your partner in Los Angeles. Priority one is to bring each of the five suspects back alive. We don't want them dead. If and when there are no other options, you are to eliminate them with extreme prejudice. Take any evidence you can find and continue with your investigation. Frankly, we're hoping you can close this up before they strike again. Since this mission is on domestic soil, it's of an extremely sensitive nature. If you blow this out there, it'll take a miracle to bring you back in from the cold. The government cannot afford to be implicated here. I understand. Any questions? When do I begin? Tomorrow. The FBI was kind enough to loan us their dossiers. You'll be on a plane to Los Angeles in the morning. Agent Maddox, there's one more thing. Your work in the field today was exemplary. Nicely done. Thank you. RICHARD MADDOX: Well, it looks like it finally came around, the one that can put you on the map. Take care of business here and next thing I know you'll be after my job. That'd be great, dad. I can use a few years like you. Growing older and wiser behind a desk instead of being shot at by anti-tank guns every time some terrorist decides he's got a cause. Well, you're a monster out there, hard as nails in the field. Your mother would have loved this. You have no idea how proud she would have been. Speaking of the family, the other day I was going through some old stuff in storage and I found this. You got to be kidding me. I took it while you were playing hide and seek. Thanks, dad. This is great. Now, get out of here and get some rest. Your flight's at 7:00 AM sharp. Don't rub it in. Jarrid, I love you, son. Don't ever forget that. [beep] [crying] [screaming] [glass shatters] Don't move. Nice mask. [grunting] Get up. Come on. What are you doing here? It's OK. Just follow me here. OK? It's in the blood. You see, it's in the white cells. Don't you get it, man? Huh, that's how they changed us. They changed us. Finally going to be OK, though, now. You see, because I'm going to fix it. All right, you can fix it. I'm going to save you and I'm going to save all of us. Right, right. OK. [grunting] He's conscious. He's OK. Easy, son. Everything's fine. He just hit you with a heavy tranquilizer. Help me on the couch. What's the story here? Well, I tried to reach you, but there was no answer. So I came by and found one of the windows broken in. Beyond that, I'm not sure exactly what happened. Maybe we should DX your assignment. You don't look so good. No, no. I'm fine. Here's the good news. The attacker was Alan Kepler, one of your suspects. He's dead. I guess he was trying to beat us to the punch. Look, from here on you talk only to me, understand? We're checking for a possible internal leak. I understand. Good. Yeah, this thing doesn't work. Whoa there, missy. Gentlemen, we can't allow this-- We want another drink. Sir, I'm sorry we can't offer you any more liquor. Well, what do you got? What do you got to offer, huh? Huh? You know I'm famous? You know I wrestle on TV? Millions of people tune in just to watch me. Hey, how about a massage, baby? Huh? Daddy needs a good massage. Why don't you give me a good rub down, huh? MAN: Hey, you still bitching about that beating Killer Stevens gave you, you cry baby? MAN: Oh, look who's talking, man. King of the whiners, I slapped that-- [interposing voices] [laughter] Oh. God, man. Jesus. [laughter] Gentlemen, please. What's the problem? Hey, get your own sky slut, Ace. That one's taken. Oh! [laughter] All right, I'm getting the drinks. I think you've had enough to drink, buddy. Step aside. [grunting] You son of a bitch. We'll be landing soon. Is there anything else I can get for you? No, thank you. OK. Well, you have a very good stay in Los Angeles. [shower running] What are you staring at? You never seen a naked woman before? No, it's not that. I was just wondering if you came with the room. Fat chance, agent Maddox. I got here early, and they weren't quite through cleaning my room, so I borrowed yours. Have you been fully briefed yet? Yes, I have our rental car. It's in the parking lot, fully loaded. Good. Here's the latest from IntelCom. Go over these tonight. I'll step outside and get some coffee. Oh, by the way, nice meeting you, agent Taylor. Nice meeting you, too. How long till we get there? Calabasas? 45 minutes tops. We just cross to the valley side and take the freeway west. You're a local agent. Are you from around here? Born and raised. So what's your favorite thing about living in LA? That's easy. You never get tired of leaving town to go on vacation. So how do you want to play this? The foulest local watering hole he hangs out at. We'll try there first. From the looks of this place, I'm a little overdressed. Maybe we should start thinking about going low profile from here on out. Right. [music playing] Dude, you either got some major balls or you're stone cold crazy. So which is it, young blood? Mr. Loggins, I'm not going to waste your time. I'm federal agent Jarrid Maddox, and I'd like to ask you a few questions. I'd prefer to do this the easy way. Let me guess, I can either go out with you quietly or I can be carried out. What's the play here? Because that last assault rap was bullshit. I told that bitch-- I said, suck it up and take a walk. She just didn't listen. You ever get the feeling like something inside you just ain't right? You know what I'm talking about? It's like your head's this old TV on the fritz. Many times you smack it, you just still can never get the picture right. As a matter of fact, I do. Really? You know, I've been getting high to the gills every night and have for damn near 10 years just to try and settle that damn screen down for a few hours. What do you do for it? I try not to think about it. Don't try and follow me. You're about to get your ass waxed by every last guy in this bar. After that, I'd leave town if I were you. It's good to have friends in low places. The suspect is leaving. Follow him to his destination then come back and get me. Are you sure you can make it out of there in one piece? Absolutely. OK. You know, I really don't approve of violence, but I guess there's no other way out of this for me, is there? Could you hold this for me? [grunting] [grunting] Thanks. How do we know he's even in there? He could have skipped out the back door at any time. He's in no hurry. He's there. OK. Let's wrap this up and cash out then. Remember, we want him alive. Loggins, it's Maddox! I hate to keep bothering you, but-- but I'm not leaving here without you! [gunfire] Where'd he go? [gunshot] I owe you, young blood. You did me a favor. [grunting] Don't move! Careful. Talk about covering your tracks. Well, let's search it. COMPUTER: You've got mail. Can you picture Loggins and Kepler working together. Seems like company intelligence isn't what it used to be. If I were you, I'd watch my back. RICHARD MADDOX (OVER PHONE): Plaza Hotel. How may I help you? I'd like a room for two with a view of the park. Good to hear your voice. Let me get it scrambled. OK, you're clear. I'm sorry. I had to retire Loggins. There was no other choice. So I heard. What's the problem? I don't know. It's hard to explain. None of this feels right to me. What does that mean? This guy doesn't fit the MO that we're looking for. I mean, he was a local drug dealer, and the only cause his friends seemed to be into was overturning the new helmet law. OK, look, table your hunch for now and proceed to the next target. We'll see where we stand from there. OK. I'll report back as soon as possible. Be careful, son. AGENT TAYLOR: Bring me up to speed on the next suspect. One Coby Miller. File lists her as a housewife in San Pedro. San Pedro. Ready, Peter? Bye, mom. Bye. I love you. See you later. OK, honey, drive safe. Boy, this is right out of the Waltons. Yeah, I know what you mean. Have fun, guys. Bye. Bye. Would you two like to join me? I won't bite. There's no way she could have made us. Where's your friend? I'm federal agent Jarrid Maddox. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Certainly, agent Maddox. Would you come inside? It could be a trap. There's only one way to find out. It's more comfortable inside. What tipped you? Call it a hunch. Meaning. That I've been expecting someone like you to appear one of these days. Just a question of when. Why is that? Because of the gift, of course. Gift? What do you mean? How do I explain it? It's like when I call for my kids and they don't come home, I can see where they are just by concentrating on them. I'm never wrong. Does this gift come with any negative side effects, headaches, lack of memory? That's a very good question, agent Maddox. Yes, it does. Have a seat, please. Mostly in recent years. I started having blackouts for no apparent reason. I just wake up on the floor and not know where I am. You're just like me, agent Maddox. How did you know that about me? Please. You're a seer. You share the same kind of gift that I do. I'm just better able to recognize it in people. Here, let me show you. OK? What's inside that chest? I can't-- COBY MILLER: Concentrate. Toys. It's filled with your children's toys. This is agent Taylor. Mrs. Miller is cooperating fully. She'll be coming with us. OK, let's do it. You wait here. I'll get the car. Everything's going to be just fine. Thank you. [gunshots] She pulled a gun on me. I turned around just for a second, and next thing I knew she was trying to take me out. I'm sorry. You're not going to find anything because there's nothing here. Procedure says we have to look. [beep] JARRID MADDOX: Tell me again exactly what happened. AGENT TAYLOR: I told you. She pulled it and I just reacted. She must have been angling to blow us both away. She gets me, you hear the shots, come rushing in and bang. End of operation. Well, did you have to kill her? I mean, procedure clearly states go for the takedown first, not the kill. God damn it. Save that crap about procedure. That bitch was about to blow me away. I wasn't exactly pulling out my manual at that point. We needed her alive. She said she was going to cooperate. Don't even tell me you're buying that passive housewife routine. You saw the gun. Yeah, I was buying it. And do you agree with that? You feel completely comfortable confirming it? OK. It appears he's having doubts. Questions are starting to arise. Where does that put us? What's contingency A at this point? I don't know. Hunter, you're done. You're never going to make it. Looks like you're starting to choke, Frankenstein. How does it feel to be so close and yet so far? [grunting] OK, OK! That's it. That's it. You win. You win. Hunter-- Hunter, that's enough. Jesus, what's your problem, man? Pay. Now. You're a cold bastard. Yeah, well, you should see me when I lose. [beep] Well, I'll see you faggots later. I'm needed downstairs. What the hell's his deal, man? I don't know. We have a renegade agent in our midst that's putting the entire company at risk for exposure. The details are not relevant at this time. You have only one objective, and that is to retire him immediately. Understood? It will be my pleasure. When will I begin? Right now. A jet is standing by. I just want you to close him out. Understood? Understood. May I ask who the agent is? Agent Jarrid Maddox. He's been with the company a long time. He could be very dangerous. You have a problem with that, agent Hunter? No, not at all. It just makes my job a hell of a lot more interesting. Good. [static] [steady beep] [screaming] [fast beep] [gasp] COMPUTER: You've got mail. Looks like you killed an innocent housewife. Getting kind of silly, isn't it? Anyway, keep up the good work. Good morning. How's the arm? It's OK. [alarm beep] Looks like we got a long drive today. Yeah, we do. [gunshot] Get down. [gunfire] All right, you guys stay with them. I'm going to go check out the rooms. And don't lose them. Those didn't look like terrorists to me. They weren't. I recognized one of them, agent Max Hunter. Company man. Young and hungry. Agent Maddox, you're about to help me get that promotion I've always wanted. All I have to do is kill you. We're going have to ditch this car. Pull in over here at that parking garage. [tires screeching] Park in here. Come back as soon as you can. [gunfire] [telephone ringing] It's all for the best, Richard. Really. What the hell's going on here? [knocking on door] AGENT TAYLOR: It's agent Taylor. JARRID MADDOX: Come in. It's unlocked. Can you help me with this? Sure. I'm sorry about the Miller incident. I know I screwed up. It was my fault. I should have sent you for the car. I should have stayed. You know, I normally get a gut feeling about things like that, but I didn't sense she was a danger. I guess you were wrong. I know how you can make me feel better though. How's that? [moaning] I got some bad news. I think we've been left out in the cold. Well, that doesn't make any sense. And we've been following our directive exactly as ordered. I just tried my contact for the third time in 24 hours without any luck. And I haven't gotten a transmission since the Miller place. My contact is dried up as well. It's your call, Jarrid. I mean, what's on your mind? Clearly, the company is trying to clean us up. So basically, we've got two options. We can pull the plug and 86 the op or we can continue on without support and try to figure it out ourselves. Well, if we have been caught in some intra-company double cross, we might as well get to the bottom of our end so we can cover our own asses. I mean, then we can get a handle on who we can trust and count on to bring us in. Agreed. More information can only mean more options for us. And besides, it's still possible these guys could clear up before it's over. It's a little late for you to become an optimist, isn't it? There's always a first time for everything. File says he's as likely to be seen here as anywhere. It's the only place that won't toss him out on site. If he's in there, I'll find him and bring him out as quietly as possible. You wait here and watch my back. I better leave this here. I don't want to spook him. Be careful. JARRID MADDOX (OVER EARPIECE): I think I see him over by the blackjack tables. I'll take a seat next to him and strike up a conversation. This has got to be my lucky table. I've tried all the others. This place is a rat hole. There isn't a lucky table within 5 miles of here. So why are you here? Why aren't you in Vegas making the big bucks? Now, why do you think, Einstein? I used to live Las Vegas. I almost sent that town into chapter 11. Really? That lucky, huh? So why'd you leave? They got bent out of shape about my good luck, said I was a card counter. Card counter. Card counter. Card counter. Told me that I'd better scram or they'd break every bone in my body. It only took a thumb to send me back. Who sent you, kid? This about child support, bank loan, visa, IRS? I get it. You're a cop. Narc? Treasury Department? FBI? You busted me, Jim. You're a spook, aren't you? A company man. Yeah, CIA. Agent Jarrid Maddox. Look, brother, I haven't done anything that high up on the ladder. Don't sell yourself short. Look, all I want to do is ask you a few questions. I'm not here to arrest you. Don't insult me. The place is covered. You'd just be embarrassing yourself. What kind of questions? Nothing you're gonna need an attorney for. Look, why don't I hit the head and then we'll talk this out, OK? Don't be long or stupid. I won't. I'm going to give him a couple of minutes. He doesn't come out, I'll go get him. [telephone ringing] Plaza Hotel, how may I help you? I'd like a room for two with the view of the park. Where are you? I need to speak to agent 82788. That agent is not available. This is Oakley. Tell me where you are so we can walk you. Sayonara, baby. [kicks wall] Why now? Why now? You should have trusted me. What's wrong? He's dead. Well, what now? We'll go back to the hotel and rest up. Tomorrow we'll just move on to the last suspect. COMPUTER: You've got new mail. Ready to take your own gamble? Call the Santa Monica Children's Orphanage. They have some very interesting information for you. What have you got to lose? Santa Monica Children's Orphanage. [telephone ringing] WOMAN (OVER PHONE): Santa Monica Children's Orphanage. May I help you? Yes. Do you have the file on a Jarrid Williams? WOMAN (OVER PHONE): I'm sorry, sir. It's after hours. And even if we did have that file, I wouldn't be able to give you any information over the telephone. I understand, but could you just let me know if you've got the file and then I can come in tomorrow and take a look at it. WOMAN (OVER PHONE): Just a moment. Sir, our computer records show that that file was closed in 1967. When he was adopted? WOMAN (OVER PHONE): No, sir, when he died. Sir? Thank you. COMPUTER: You've got new mail. Your dossier is wrong. Suspect five lives at 1100 Altair Place in Venice, California. I'll be expecting you. What is it? Get your clothes on. We got to be out fast? Now? Now. There's men on the way with room service. [gunfire] MAN: Damn it. He's not here. [gunfire] Pack up. We're checking out. Better leave a big tip for the maid. So we're going to Sagan's from here, right? JARRID MADDOX: Right. OK, that's right up the street in Santa Monica, 1700 Broadway? No. South of Venice. But the dossier says-- Doesn't matter what it says. We got an update. From who? A friend. OK. Then Venice it is. I don't see anything. It looks clear out here. Maddox will be here in a few minutes, and there's plenty of him to go around. Looks like there's a possible suspect at the south entrance. Can you make an ID? Yes, I can. It's not him. Boys, I think we've been had. SAGAN: Doors open. Come in. Relax. It's OK. Well, folks, I'm glad we could finally get together. How you been? I want you to run a global track on agent Taylor. I can guarantee she's carrying a tracking chip from a prior assignment. Yes, very good, son. Now, get off your ass and do it. It's good to see you again, agent Maddox. Again? We've never met. Oh, yes, we actually have, yes. But that's OK. You don't remember now. We'll get to that later. Come in, come in, have a seat. Thank you. Yeah, it's terrible. You know, back in late '85, I'm just crossing the street, and a drunk driver runs me over and, well, I was supposed to be dead, but I'm not. Well, half of me is. Good work. Now, give me the address. I was working on my post-doctorate for biophysics. And you'd be amazed at the sheer mass of time you have on your hands when you can no longer walk. No distractions. You see, it's just me and my mind and my computer. So you were the one sending all the email. Well, let's get to the fun stuff. You know, after the incident, I began to experience what today is called remote viewing experiences. What exactly does that mean? Well, I'm sure agent Maddox knows exactly what I'm talking about. Would you like a drink? Duty, duty. You're on duty. That's right. I'm going to have one, if that's OK. Anyway, my mind started rolling, and I started surfing the net and hacking into government files, and I stumbled upon something that put it all together. And that is? Well, back in 1965, the CIA, they got a top secret black ops in a new attempt to find the missing POWs. Now, the operation was called Sunstreak, and this was a-- really, a crazy, crazy project. Sunstreak had remote viewers out there gathering intelligence from behind enemy lines. What were they looking for? POW kids. What did they find? Nothing. All of this. All of this has been for nothing. Fascinating stuff, Mr. Sagan, but what does all this have to do with you and me? The remote viewers were children. They actually recruited them as orphans, from the ages of 7 to 10. The children of Sunstreak. They had six in all. You, me, and the others. The grand plan had failed, and the kids were getting older, and a decision had to be made. A mind wash with electroshock therapy, and a little psychedelic action and just cut them loose and send them on with safe new families. And the others are dead? Oh, yes. Yes. So now it's just you and me. Yeah. But why now after 30 years? Side effects, man. Dang. I mean, look, first of all, look at Kepler and Loggins. I mean, how much longer until they completely unravel. How much longer until we all do? So the company sends me out to bring everyone in alive and at least try to help us, but obviously somebody had a plan of their own. Yeah, yeah. That's exactly-- [gunshots] Initially I was supposed to go along and make sure that none of the suspects came back alive. Then Hunter came into the picture, which was fine by me, except I realized that if I got in the way, I was as expendable as you were. Why didn't you kill me before? You had plenty of chances. They told me not to even think about it, because you were some kind of mind reader. Some kind of magical power you turned out to be. You never even caught on. And the Miller incident, I shot myself. So now, I kill you, I square up with Hunter, and I come home a hero. Are you finished yet? Mm-mm. No. But you are. [click] I left you two rounds in case I was wrong about you, but I'm never wrong. [grunting] [gunfire] [explosion] [coughing] [gunfire] [grunting] [grunting] [gunfire] [grunting] I think I know where he's headed. Maybe, if we're lucky. [train horn] All right, look. Remember what I said. Watch yourself. This guy's dangerous. We'll get him. [grunting] [grunting] [train horn] [gunfire] Stay down. [grunting] You should have retired when you had the chance, old timer. When I get finished with you, I'm going to take care of your old man. All right. Come on, come on. [grunting] Nice try, rookie. [screaming] [train horn] Thanks for bringing me in, dad. It was the only way, son. I hope so, because this isn't going to be easy. I still can't believe this whole Sunstreak project, and that you were involved. Well, as young as I was, I still felt that Sunstreak was a terrible mistake. Most of us did. But I was only a class II operative then. There was so many other heinous deals going down at the time that the top brass had just tuned out completely. When it was over, I pushed to adopt one of the kids. They gave me hell at first. Thought I'd gone off my rocker. When they finally reviewed it, they saw there was no better place for the subjects to be than with a safe company-connected parent. They gave me you. I always tried to do what I could to make up for the horrors you'd been through, a second chance to grow up feeling cared for. You did a good job, dad. Well, I hope this plan works, because if it doesn't, I'm not going to be much help like this. Good morning, Bobby. Good morning, Mr. Maddox, sir. We'll be joining them down on level six. No need for you to call down. I don't want to interrupt them. Yes, sir. Nice work, dad. You stay in this business 30 odd years, you'll learn a few things. This way. Down here. Here we go. Let's hope it takes. [beep] [screaming] Maddox, what are you doing here? Game's over, Bill. We can't keep this under the rug anymore. We're going to have to bite the bullet and come clean on this one. Like hell we are. Take these two men to the interrogation chamber. Don't try it. [grunting] Sorry, fellas. You're on the bench for this one. You don't seem to understand. We were trying to save American lives with this operation. And if we had succeeded, we would changed the whole course of the war. We were just children, for God's sakes. You're losing your objectivity, agent Maddox. We never meant to harm you. We only meant to help you. Whatever Oakley was up to, it was her doing. Help me? Is this how you were going to help me? That's entirely irrelevant now. You'll never get out of this building alive. It's time to take off the white hat and get real. Is this real enough for you? Congratulations, Oakley. You're going to be a TV star. Gentlemen, it's time to meet your public. Outside. [beep] [agitated breathing] Is he going to make it? Kill me. Kill-- kill me. Please, kill me. [faster beep] [solid beep] SAGAN (VOICEOVER): Look at Kepler and Loggins. I mean, how much longer until they completely unravel? How much longer until we all do? [music playing]
