TALKING TO BIRDS What's going on? Police, Johann speaking. At last. We should have got rid of those dogs long ago. It's no good being a complete pushover all the time. Don't say you're shooting dogs on my doorstep? What should we do? Fine them? I'm more concerned with safety, especially the patients'. It would kill old Toti if he heard his dogs had been shot. What if they start biting people? They may have rabies! I'm not missing the chance to shoot that pack of hounds while I can and burning down old Toti's lair! Somebody suggested we get his niece to take the dogs home. Dua, the artist. She has an exhibition on in town. Artist? That's one way of describing her! She's crazy. Have you seen the rubbish people call art nowadays? They say she knows how to handle the dogs. Dua, a phone call for you, someone from the hospital. - What? - Phone call! Phone call? Hi, boys. Come on then. Come here. Everything's alright. Hello, I'm Dua, Toti's niece. Thank you for coming. He hasn't regained consciousness. Here comes the freak. It might be a good idea to get these dogs out of this town. They can't stay in the county long. - This is no place for you or them. - What do you mean? I was speaking plain and simple Icelandic. I thought you might be able to understand me. Come on. Why were you so hard on her? I just speak my mind. I think she and those dogs are a bloody nuisance around here. Is she trying to make fools of us? Exhibiting that rubbish of hers. Who's paying for it? We are! Besides, she has an unsettling effect on men. - So that's what you mean. - Yes, it is. A young filly like that. Everybody knows their morals, that arty crowd in Reykjavik. And the men are all over her. You were trying to rub up against her last summer. We were just friends. So where's his mother, Lobbi? Ask him about my sister Loa. She died a long time ago, Mum. You know that very well. Did my sister Loa die? Ask Simon why he went to prison. Stop this nonsense, Mum. You know everyone goes to prison in America. You'd think you'd never watched TV. You wanted to say something, Lobbi? No. No. Not a word. - Who's this? - Simon, my cousin from America. Ah, so that's him. I ought to have all these bloody dogs shot. I tolerated the old guy but there's no sense in you staying here. - Won't you come in? - Yes. Don't you get lonely out here? No. Well, maybe once in a while. Know what I do when I feel lonely? No, what? I masturbate. Don't you masturbate? Doesn't everyone? I often feel lonely. I could have all these dogs killed. The doctor said it might be best to burn down this house, too. I don't think you should stay here. You should leave. Tell him he can just keep the car if he can get it running. I just told him that! You have to learn to speak English like me. Women! Look, Mum! American money! - American money! - Yes. Smell it. He's asking if we've got a search warrant. I know what he's saying. Let's go. I'm not putting up with this. What are they up to now? Samantha, stop it! I'm worried about this place. - Are you alone here? - Yes. Why do you ask? Simon the American was here the other day. Do you realise he's dangerous? He spent a long time in prison. Are you warning me off him? No. There's another, more serious matter. It's about keeping a bird of a protected species. What? I don't know what you're talking about. Well then, maybe we should go inside and discuss it. I know you've got a falcon here. And that you are in contact with a known American criminal. People might put two and two together. Do you realise that smuggling a falcon can get you years in prison? Uncle Toti found the falcon. It had a broken wing and was helpless. So you say. I'm told that Toti is unlikely to regain consciousness. And whom do you think the court would believe, you or me? But of course it needn't come to that, not if we can be friends. Johann, don't! Stop it! Stop it! Leave me alone! Don't go against me, it's not worth it. Leave me alonei Leave me alonei Finish the job! TRAVEL FUND FOR THE ELDERLY Dear Toti. I did everything I could for your dogs. But I couldn't save them. I'll do everything I can to save our falcon. Now get well. My sweet. Is this good? Don't eat it all. Easy. Calm down. I know you're hungry and perhaps thirsty, too. Isn't anyone taking care of you? Let me see if there is any money here. Then you can go buy some food. Or I can go for you? Cheers! Here's to the birds of the skies.
