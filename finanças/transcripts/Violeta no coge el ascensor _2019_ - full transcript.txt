You tell me. A little bit... Place it closer. A bit higher. There. I think the left side is a little bit crooked. Bring the right side higher up. No, the other right side. The opposite. There you go. Well, no. What did you do? I don't know, it doesn't work. - Are you ready? - You bet. - Let's go? - Let's go! It's time to get wet. It's time to get wet. I need some water. - What? - Some water. I can't see! Where do you want it? - In the eyes, because I can't see. - Wait. - Wait. - Come here. Let me, asshole. Let's see. You have to be really clean, really clean to go to work. Come here, come here. - Did you hit yourself? - Yes. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. - Sure? - It's fine. - That's life. - That's life. Pass me my razor. It's over there. Thanks. Can I use it too? I want to shave my... Would you like it if I shaved my legs? Can you imagine? Please don't. - Wouldn't it suit me? - No! Well if I don't shave mine, neither do you. - Fine. - Fine. Fine. Come on. We're going to be late. Dude, look. I have blue fluff on me. Look. This is how I combed my hair... To go to school. Like this. - Like an altar boy. - Yes. - So cute. - With my hands. - I haven't used a comb in my life. - Fancy that. Not even when you had long hair? - How do you know that? - I just know. And how long did I have it? I think you had a long hair moment, for sure. I'm sure you went through that phase. You'll never know. Dude, it's not coming out! We'll have to amputate. It's everywhere! And if we get back in the shower? I have blue nipples! I'm a muppet, no one is going to love me. If you go like this, everyone will love you. But I don't think it's a good idea. No. - Look, more. - Let me see. It doesn't look good... Keep doing it, keep picking them off. By the way, I have some news to tell you. Good news? I'd say so. Let's say I'm not gonna have the same occupation anymore. Really? Have you been promoted? Not exactly. I quit my job. It's summer. And I don't want to let a job that I don't like at all ruin it. So I was thinking that what I want to do today is to go the mountains and spend the day lying in the sun. I think it's a great idea. And today I'm not going to feel bad about it. And you should come with me. I have to go to work. Dude, it's everywhere... You can't go to work like this. They'll think you're a muppet. They'll think: ''What a hardworking intern, we should hire her.'' Don't you want to come with me to Rascafría? Today is a really important day. Why? Because we have a really important meeting. Some other day. Okay. Fine. Then your goddamn mom can clean your arm. Did you see how natural? We've started shooting, right? So, you've resigned? Yes. He's left. Yesterday. Resigning isn't always a bad thing. Well, Viole is super excited about my decision. Right? Well, if it's what you want, I think it's great. Maybe it's a good time... to get back with the band, play a little... He doesn't know if music makes him happy. Nothing ever makes anyone completely happy. Do you really think that? Right, Sara. I completely agree with you. For once, someone tells things the way they are. Yes. Violeta knows more about my decision. Violeta, give her the scoop. Well, his job didn't make him happy. He doesn't know if music makes him happy, and he wants to go to a reservoir and spend the day with me. - Very nice. - That's right. Right. I couldn't have said it better. It's that simple. She's all dressed up. Did you notice? Yes. - Very pretty. - Thank you. I have an important meeting. It'd make me happy if the project came through. I thought it was because all your clothes were dirty. No, it's on purpose. - You look gorgeous, I mean it. - Thanks. Are you sleeping with someone at work? Are you stupid? No. I'm not sleeping with anyone. Can you leave me and my dress alone? You're bothering us. It's a really lovely dress. - Thanks. - Am I bothering your dress? Really? That's awful. My most sincere apology to that... - Beautiful dress. - Thanks. Wait, let me ask. Apology accepted. AUGUST 4th - FRIDAY. The demo is pretty bad. I've found a lot of orphan and widow lines. Not again! We checked it but... Well, whatever. We'll check it later. We're going to have a second meeting because I want everyone to check the graphic line. - Anything else? - No. Let's meet at... Three, two-thirty? Three, we'll already have eaten. Have a coffee, please. I'm going to revise Clara's last cover and that's about it. And make stories. See you later. Well, Viole... I'll send it to you later, okay? We've got until three to do nothing. Great. As usual. What are you going to do now? I'm reading Iberian Adventures by Gibson. Because Shitty Spain was too mainstream for you, right? I don't like to follow the masses. I'm a free spirit. Manolo Prieto designed the bull on the cover. Sorry? The bull on the cover. Manolo Prieto designed it. It was commissioned by the Osborne wineries but it became cultural heritage in the 90s. After Borrel tried to remove them. Manolo Prieto has a story collection, he did the covers and they're cool. I saw them at an exhibition, it was great. The new girl knows her stuff. There's a press article by Manuel Vicent that... It says a lot about Spaniards that our national emblem is an animal that is continually defeated. Dude! Jesus! I wasn't expecting that. It was a great throw. Put me on the board. An ambush. It wasn't an ambush. It was amazing. Dude, it doesn't count. What do you prefer, Violeta o Viole? Violeta. It's unfair. No, no. It's history. You've broken the gender barrier. Thanks. - So, coming to the party tonight? - Yes. Don't feel pressured. But you should. No, I'm looking forward to it. It's going to be really cool. I was so confused... Sorry, go on. It's like there are only two states: with a boyfriend or looking for one. Forget about boyfriends. I say goodbye to all of them every two months. Sorry, do you work here? Yes. Do you know Violeta? Do you know where I can find her? - Violeta from the publishing house? - That's right. - The girl from design? - Yes. We work with her. I'm her boyfriend. Not a stalker. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. - Do you want to go in? - Yes. There are two ways: the main entry or the service entry. For the service entry, just go through the doorway, and take the first door on the left. If you want to go through the main entry it's more complicated, but much nicer. - I'd go through the service one. - Perfect. I'm gonna go through the courtyard. - Great. See you. - Bye. What about him? And what did your ex say? - Blow by blow? - Blow by blow. Number one: when the thing does more bad than good, bye. Number two: if there's more affection than love, more than, you know... - Passion? - Yes. Bye, bye. It's better to meet new people than spend Saturdays at home watching TV. Well, that makes sense. She told me she can only be with me two hours a day. And I had to develop a personal project. Okay. I want to see your project. Okay. I'll show it to you. But the thing is she said that in exchange for ''classes'' I had to take care of her cat and her son. Yes, and take it to the vet. Hello. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Miguel. Nice to meet you. Viole has talked about you. The famous ''Apostles''. I was nearby... And it's almost two o'clock. I thought I'd swing by and see if you wanted to have lunch. I don't know if you can, or if they let you... Of course. - Is it okay if I go to lunch? - Yes. Later we could go to Costello, the guys are performing. And leave Rascafría for tomorrow, right? I have this work thing tonight... If you have something better to do, go ahead, don't feel pressured. Well, Miguel, you can come if you want. It's a work do, but maybe we won't bore you. Okay. It's a good plan. When the gig ends, if I still have time I'll go. Now I have a party dress and a party companion. I didn't know you had a dress already, great. Shall we go? Well, if you want. I called you and saw that you didn't pick up. Maybe you were busy... Mateo was telling us something and I didn't want to interrupt. It was nothing. Is there anything I can… Do I bring anything? Just your handsome face. Perfect. I'll be back. You better. See you later. And be careful, I'll beat that score. Okay, sure. And remember: the meeting is at three. Don't be late. See you. Hey, I didn't finish my story. You can finish it for me. I'm your biggest fan. Your only fan. Sorry, nothing personal. What just happened here? Well, I think we just made a new friend! We should wait until the first person arrives. Yes, sounds about right. The first one to arrive feels awkward. Imagine arriving here now. At this shitty party... Yes. Have you ever been this hot? Don't your glasses slip off with the sweat? You know what happens? The mix of iron and sweat makes me smell like an iron foundry. By the way, I brought a cheese board. Thanks, you didn't have to. How does it open? It has a plastic tag you pull. Right. Got it? Give it to me. I'll do it. Hey, don't take it badly... Well, that sounds ominous. This afternoon... - This afternoon you said ''real heavy''. - Yes. Did it annoy you? - Yes, it's like... - It's correct. I can't stand the Language Academy. Now... It approves everything. But if it's written down, it doesn't bother me so much. - It's when I hear it. - Is it weird when you hear it? ''Real heavy'' should be ''really heavy''. You can actually say both. It's like a physical reaction. Do you want some guacamole? No, thanks. I hope Violeta's boyfriend appreciates these things. Looks like he's been around. The Language Academy tells you what is used. Not the rule. It gives you suggestions. The Academy is normative and descriptive. I didn't know you were from there. Any recommendations? I don't know. What do you like to do? Right now, nothing. He's left work. That has nothing to do with what we were talking about. She means that you're free and you have more time to do stuff. Let's see. My job didn't make me happy. Playing with my band didn't make me happy, either. But there must be something that I like doing, right? Well there isn't. I decided to not do anything for a while. I know it sounds stupid, what I'm saying, but... It is what it is. But... how do you do nothing? I'm figuring it out. I started today. I read for a while. I bought the newspaper. We ate lasagne. But that is doing something. Yes, but I mean… I mean nothing with a goal. Nothing that has to do with a professional goal. Going with the flow. Okay. Sounds cool. Well, you tell me something. Viole told me you're preparing a children's collection... Yes, it's still at the development stage. Our boss, who told us that he would come and he hasn't, asked us to make it more contemporary. It was pretty unexpected. The project was approved in the middle of August. So Violeta coming on board has been perfect. I don't think all these people here want to talk about this on a Friday. But I'll tell you. The concept. Let me explain it to you, because you don't work, but if you worked... Man, I have worked. I know, don't take it badly. Don't get me wrong. I meant not in this sector. I didn't take it badly. A work do is a place where people come to talk about other things. I'm the host, this is my house, and I'm doing a shit job. You're doing fine. The guacamole was delicious. The beer is cold. - Did you make the guacamole? - Yes. With the hand blender. - It tastes great. - Who wants a beer? - This place is great. - Yes, do you like it? I moved here not long ago. Will you throw more parties before the end of the summer? If that's what you want… - Yes. - Really? We could co-host it. - Co-host? - Yeah. Yeah. We could come and say this is our party too? Like the Presley family. - It's very trendy now. - Really? Commerce and collaborative parties. It's what's hot in Malasaña. - Do you do collaborative commerce? - No. When someone lives alone, like me, you call a friend to help with prepping and expenses. They both have the right to invite whoever they want. You call that co-host? You can also call it co-organization. From the Latin, no, the English. For example, today, Mateo... Has co-hosted this with you? He's my co-host, but not completely. My consigliere. - Consigliere? - Yeah. - I didn't know you were so close. - Or so Italian. I'm telling you this because you seem cool people. More on the party scene. Yes... Well, especially Miguel. Yeah, I'm a party person. Really? You... How... How old are you? I'm 28. He's an older man. I'm an older man. It's not that bad. I thought it would be worse. - Worse? - You seem very mature. Mentally. Antonio Banderas told Melanie: ''Forty is the new thirty.'' So thirty is the new twenty. - And so on. - Successively. What I just said sounds like an insult: - No worries. - ''I thought you were older''. Seriously. I get what you're saying. A lot of people tell me that. I get that you want to apologize. But I get your humor. I get your humor perfectly. I'll apologize for a lot of things. You should know that about me. It's okay. Everything's cool. Give me a hug. All good, my friend. It's all good, my friend. Do you want snacks? Sure. I'm tired. I'm so hot… and a bit drunk. I wanted to be the funny one and I never am. You are funny. That's not true, you're super funny. No, I'm not. When he's there I'm not funny. Do you think he was mad that I didn't let him come up? Well, what's done is done. - Tomorrow we're off to the mountains. - The mountains… Think about it. Think it over. Maybe I should start smoking. To think things over more calmly. Well, good night. - Good night. - Bye, bye. Are you still awake? Yes. Do you think I should break up with him? I don't know. It's your decision, right? Do you feel like a girlfriend? I don't know. I don't want to decide anything, ever again. Can't you decide for me? - No. - Jesus. Close your eyes for a minute. Are you going to throw sand at me? No, I don't think so. You've discovered my plan, but I have another option. Keep your eyes closed, don't open them. They're closed. You can open them now. Dude, so cool! A snorkel mask. - Do you like it? - It's great. I love it, thank you so much. I just thought that since we were coming here, maybe there was a treasure hidden out there. Can you imagine? We might find something. A galleon. A bunch of... gold, of doubloons. That's so cool. Thank you very much. - It's great. - Really? Maybe we could use them in the tub. Sure. - Right? - Sure. Like Jacques Cousteau. Remember that song? - About Cousteau? - No. It was an internet hit. When we were little, my cousin Loren loved diving in my aunt's pool with goggles. And we called him Loren Cousteau. Fancy that. I didn't know you had a cousin Loren. Yeah, cousin Loren. The famous cousin Loren. I've realized there are things I don't know about you. Yeah, true. So, I have a cousin called Loren who likes diving with masks. What else do you want to know? I don't know, more stuff. Well... When I was 13. I had a girlfriend for two and a half years. Until I was 15-and-a-half. That's amazing. Yes, we were really in love. In fact... we thought we'd get married, we were sure. One day... we had an argument about if we'd still be together after high school. - That was how in love we were. - Oh my God. That's longer than I've been in anything my whole life. She was great. But then I started to get into music and things, and since she wasn't into my stuff, I decided to... I decided to break up with her. - What an asshole. - Yes. Yes. Has it never happened to you when you start something that it's your whole life, your world? When you started drawing, for example. Don't you think it was... the most important thing to you? Something like that. I thought: she's never going to get me. She's not going to connect with me. And... And I broke up with her. And then I was sad for like a year. Until you were 16? Yeah, until I was 16. And what happened then? What changed? Well... I started to do sport, to feel better. - I don't know. - I didn't know you did sport. Yes, I did sport for a while. I was an asshole. I was an asshole. An asshole. I'm not good at breakups. I'm still not good now. Well, I don't know anyone who's good at breakups. Right, but I'm the worst. I'm the worst. Okay. I didn't said anything up to now, but you look pretty in that snorkel mask. They really suit you. - You too, you look amazing. - Really? I think I was born to wear masks like this. These ones particularly. It's my dream mask. Since cousin Loren served as an example. Yeah, I think you should never take them off. They're so tight! Thanks for telling me all that. Yeah. Okay, we've cut. That ending was really cool. Yep. How's your bruise? Okay. Let me see it. It changes color at times. I've had a great time today. Yes, me too. It was cool. Are you okay? Yeah. Sure? Yeah, I'm just a bit hot. Maybe you have a fever. We spent a lot of time in the sun. I'm gonna fetch something. I don't know if it'll work, I saw it on Callejeros Viajeros. Callejeros Viajeros? Very reliable. Take it off. Let's see, I'm going to put this here. - It's really cold, huh? - Yes. Lift up your arm. Did you like it? Yeah, it was somewhere between horrible and really cool. Yeah, that fine line. And this is what they did on Callejeros Viajeros. Why do they smell of fish? - They don't smell of fish. - They do a bit. This is what they do. Lie face down. Lie face down. Am I bugging you or are you okay? No, I'm just a bit hot. I'm wearing a wet swimsuit and I'm a little... Right. What's up? I have a lot of fun when I'm with you. You make me laugh a lot. But... But I don't know, sometimes... Don't touch me now, I got burned and I'm all sticky. What do you want me to do? Do I go? No, no... it's just we walked a lot. - It's been a long day... - Come on, Viole. I'll make it easy for you. - What? - Well... You want to break up and you can't do it. Or you don't know how. And this is super weird. So I'm going to do it for you. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's all right. Well, this is how relationships are. You break up... Okay. I got it. Do you want to do another take? Well... We'll be in touch. Okay? Now what? What's the next step? Let's capture this moment. The summer of love is over. We don't know how to take a photo! I'm going to do the same. No, right? Life, life. This is the life. - Vigo. - Formentera. Hey. Cuba. Boat. Whoever doesn't have a boat is a loser. Murcia. Murcia? I have an idea. Get up. You're gonna have to drag me. I can't. I just can't. It's like everyone is screwing each other over all the time. The worst thing isn't that they're fucking each other on purpose. That's just the plot of a lot of plays. The real tragedy is that nobody actually listens. Everyone falls in love with the wrong person. They're walking in opposite directions. And no one really hears what the other one is saying. I'll take off my goggles, I can't be serious with them. That's why Shakespeare is so tragic. It's tragic because people do terrible things. But also because no one listens to one other. I'm listening to you all the time. I know, but do you understand me? The thing is, I feel hassled. People hassle me when they're all together. - It hassles me. - I get that sometimes. That feeling of coming together, union, ''all in one'', it makes me nervous and makes me feel dumb. Yes. Right now what really frustrates me is that I like a bunch of things. But I think that all I do is insignificant and mediocre. AUGUST 7th - MONDAY. I have an idea, you'll love it. - Let's see. - Are you ready? Shoot. I'm a fish-man. It's awesome. I don't usually tell this to anyone. - Are you a merman? - No, no. But I have a kind of membrane between my toes and I have fins. - Really? - It's amazing, look. Wait, one second. - Go ahead. - Right. And... Wow, you're right. You can't really tell, but even so. When I was little I thought I had super powers. - That's why you never wear flip flops? - Yeah, and they're tacky. Can you swim faster thanks to that? Not really. I don't know, I'm not a very aquatic person. You have fish fins but you don't like water? No idea, we've never made an issue of it in my family. Did it make you feel better? Yeah, thanks. Still thinking about your boyfriend? I don't even remember his name. How about another party at my place this weekend? Yes. We already have food. - He's a sardine. - Gonna roast me? Sounds perfect. Before you came, before all this entertainment, I was in the middle of a story, about a call I got from Manel, my agent. Manel, my agent? A few months ago, he sent me an email from Barcelona saying he really liked my blog. - It's great, I'm a real fan. - Thanks. The thing is he told me he wanted to pitch it to producers. A TV show of your blog? You're one, two or twenty-five steps ahead. But am I wrong? Your blog will be a show? The conversation was that perhaps, maybe, possibly, we could expect an offer soon. That's great! - It's cool, yes. - It's marvelous. It's a web series, don't get overexcited. But yes, it's super cool. And besides, it's already written. Hey, catch it! - Sorry. - It's okay. I overdid it. I didn't want to hit you. Don't worry. You've made it in the publishing and AV world. Let me tell you something. I'm allowing myself to enjoy it. Sure. - Now the party has a theme! - Sure. - Let's celebrate. - Let's throw a party for you. Everyone has to dress up as Pablo, the success story. I think all my plaid shirts are dirty. Your hundreds of thousands of plaid shirts? I think I have one here. Yes. - Why? - I have it just in case. I sweat a lot. But it's clean. I didn't bring my glasses. - I'll ask Pilar. - And your watch on the other hand. I check the time on my cell. That's why you're always late. We should probably get to work. You are working, man. You are working very hard. Ready. Don't expect a lot, I'm terrible at impersonations. Don't underrate yourself. Sit the same way. Now do the First Communion one. What are we? The Mosasaurus from Jurassic Park, when it spits poison in the car. That moment. Okay. Hey, if you want, I can drive you home later. - My car has already been fixed. - Yes, please. I was going to complain about the heat. I'd love to drive you. Honk when you pass me on the bridge. - Of course. - Some people throw garbage when I pass them on my bike. That's not true. No. But they threw a Fanta at me once. Really? Lemon flavor. - Did Whitley write to you? - What? - Whitley. - No. I'm leaving, I'm leaving. To the Sinai. Pilgrimage… I don't believe it. Did you take one of my Tupperware the other day? - Not me, how about you? - Nope. I bought a pair of boots to die for. They're really for the mountain and the Sinai is rock, but whatever. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow. I'm so excited. Are you going anywhere? - To Calahorra for a few days. - Sorry? Part of La Rioja. My parents are from there. Okay. How about you? No, I'm not going. I always stay. Well, Madrid is nice in August. Not many people... Do you want to come up? If you're not busy right now? I had something on, but okay. Come on. - Hi. - Hi. Do you remember Pablo? You went to his party. - Nice to see you again. - Same here. Your apartment is cool. Yeah, it's very quiet. He gave me a ride. Wow, nice gesture. Yes. - What are you doing? - Nothing. I should be looking for a job, but I'm not doing anything. I'm gonna go out. I've been locked up here for too long. See you later. Okay. Ciao. - Nice to see you. - Same here. A bit more interaction and laughter. It's not that awkward. It's awkward, but… What did you do as a kid? Just read? Yeah. Do you think I'm doing okay at the office? Yes, I think you're doing great. Hello? I hear you loud and clear. I think you're doing a great job. I think you're fucking smart. And you have a great personality. And I think you're very intelligent. And I think Mateo and I would sink in shit if you weren't there to pull us out. And that's why I go to work everyday. Thanks. You're welcome. I have to hang up. These international calls are so expensive. I just wanted you to know how amazing you are. You look like Lady Gaga. Do you know who that is? Rings a bell? Are you okay? Viole! Call me, say my name so it appears in the movie. AUGUST 11th - FRIDAY I swear it, Mamen. What about you? Are you in Almería? Lucky you. Thanks. Shall we go? What's up? Are you drunk? Yeah, almost. In my epitaph I'd always thought I'd write: ''I told you I felt bad''. But I was thinking it should say, ''I chose the wrong vocation''. What? How's that? Simple. I finished Biology. At 18 you don't know what you're doing. I was all over the place. She knows what I'm on about. I was lost. I started a master's in plant physiology, that thing I told you about. I emailed you. Don't know if you got it. Yeah, I did. That's right. And now I'm here emailing you texts. Because life takes many turns. We'd like to set up our own publishing house, publishing books that address our obsessions. Yes, stuff about us. - You're gonna get so rich. - Yes. I think I like these better. It's a little obvious, isn't it? Yeah, but... - It is what it is. - I'd go more for red. - Sort of here. - Really? I like this here. But it's a bit obvious, right? Right. What's going on? Come and check this out. - Is she the author? - Looks like it. - The book is great. - Thanks. Thanks. Mateo, you have to come see this. You'll love it. It's first-class shit. I'm not here. It's a one-off. I have to finish this shit. - I have to finish this shit. - It's a scoop. You look so pretty. Is it your hair? It looks different... I dyed it pink. Right, you were brunette before. Yes. Well, you know where we are. Okay, fine... - Thanks. - Bye. Where do you want to start? Are you okay? No, he's in the zone. I get it. I know when he's working. Are you okay, Mateo? This is like marriage counseling. Leave him alone. Will we be in trouble? Never seen him this way. I think I'm gonna go out. I think it's my fault. No. It's my problem. - Really? - Really. I'll talk to him later. He's my co-worker. It's my problem, too. I swear he's fine. I'm gonna go out and talk to him. I feel bad. What's that? This? You'll see. Put it here and let it go. So cool! Let's try joining them without touching. It's impossible. They're too attracted. Cool. - I wanted to ask you... - If I want to marry you? No... What you said the other day, do you really think that? - I love this. - Give it back. Give me back my stick. This is what happens when you hang out with someone younger. Come on, that must hurt. I'm a jerk. I know what you wanted to ask me. Pablo and you talk about it all the time. You already know how he thinks. Yes, of course I do. But you? Well, I think kind of the same thing. The other day you sounded like him. No. I agree with what he says, but what I said the other day are my ideas. He didn't tell me any. Well, you talk like him. You use the same arguments as Pablo. Don't tell me that because. I hate those couples that start dating and begin dressing the same, thinking the same... Expressing themselves the same way. I swear that's not me. What I said is what I've always felt. Okay. There you go. Viole! Move to your right. Hello? Don't worry. I wanted to go to the cinema anyway. Well, it's August, the listings are shit. Okay, don't worry. Kisses. This is awesome. The studio had tonnes of light. So cool. Look, so young. - Jesus! - I've also had a past. Look at this one. - Who's that? - That's her son. So cute! Hey, this photo is so cool. It's fantastic because you actually look handsome. I love you too. Charlie her PA took it. We became great friends. You play the accordion? Forget it, he looks like Hugh Jackman. I play the flugelhorn. - A flugelhorn? - You play the flugelhorn? Get out of here. I play the accordion! - I have a couple at home. - Really? I quit the piano and then I chose the flugelhorn. My great-grandfather used to play. My grandma bought an accordion for an uncle of mine. He didn't play much, quit it, then gave it to me. It was just sitting there for almost 40 years. That's so nice. - It's amazing we both play. - Yes. - Amazing. - Do you practice a lot? - When I get bored. - But do you have a flugelhorn? Yes. - That's really cool. - Yes, she has it. Could we play together? For sure. There must be some sheet music. Guys, I had an idea. Let's form a band. I don't play, but I can sing. We could get together some time. I haven't played in months. All right. - Seriously? - It's a deal. We're gonna play together. Are you okay like that? I didn't know you played. Yes. Look, you'll like this one. - What is it? - It's a mobile by Calder. Hey, it's amazing we both play. We're musical soulmates. Nobody chooses those instruments. - No. - They're not popular instruments. Look, this is an art gallery too. I visited it. What does a flugelhorn look like? Like a trumpet. Do I get a kiss me before I go? Well, one more won't kill me. Stay the night. That was terribly aggressive. What did you expect? A soft and tender one... I don't feel soft or tender. Do you feel wild? Like in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof? No, that isn't it either. Too soft and tender. Something in between. Soft and tender, like sir wanted. - That's how artists are. - Yeah, sure. I'll write letters to you. Like Perez Galdós to Pardo Bazán. Perez Galdós was a womanizer? No, but an awesome writer. Anyway, that's not the point. The point is I'm crazy about you. When I get back from Barcelona we'll put an end to this tension. Or we'll break up. See you Monday? You're not mad? No. Have a good trip. Can I kiss your wound as a sign of my devotion? No. - I'd rather you stayed. - Not tonight. I have a 7am train tomorrow. Bye. God be with you. You're fantastic. I don't deserve you. Good night. Violeta, what are you…? I don't want to feel like I've wasted the summer. No one ever does anything useful in the summer. Don't stress over that. I know. But knowing how to waste it, that's an art. He was very insistent and I got carried away. I've spent the last few days acting like a robot. I haven't thought about anything. I have stopped to think... but in my mind the opposite is happening. Now it looks like me who's after him. Listen, this guy is an option. It's okay to choose the wrong option. Chill. Hiya. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Bravo! - That was so embarrassing. - So embarrassing. - No, it was great. - No. - Yes, it was. Stop looking at me and look at the music. What a couple. Are you ready? It'll blow you away. - I'm sure of it. - I'm saying this to prepare you. You've been playing. Yesterday I looked at the music a bit. - Now we can go to the street party. - Yes. Let's go. AUGUST 14th - MONDAY. Forty-one, second take. Oh my God. Why me? Take me soon. Let's see, guys. Fina is on vacation. Someone has to take calls. I'm not going to do it, I hate talking on the phone. But you two spend all day on the phone. Heads or tails? Yeah, come on. Heads or tails? What's it to be? Heads. Tails. What's that? - Heads, heads. - It's heads. It's you. Let's do a test. Let yourself go. Go on, surprise us. Ring, ring. Pick up. Hello, Colombine Publishing. Who do you wish to speak to? You're great, the job is all yours. Manel, we haven't moved on. You're not putting across my ideas properly. I love this part. And then you don't pass it on to me properly. And you confuse me. If I could speak with someone. Yes, with Cati or whoever. I haven't checked this. If I have to go back to Barcelona for this, no problem. But I can only do it if I know what they want. I find it hard to work on two things and make changes for nothing. Maybe what you can do is add thicker contours. Like silhouetted. Yes, fine, I'm glad. Let's add a bubble where it says ''Mr. Touch Me''... Is it a joke? Don't you remember it? When you called and asked for Mr. Touch Me. ''What Touch Me?'' they asked and you'd say ''Come-and-Touch-my-balls''. Come-and-touch-my-balls. Your generation is so dumb. Well, but it works. All the kids laugh at it. That's just your point of view... Shall we have lunch? - Okay. - And finish it later. Manel, we talk too much on the phone. How's the movie going? Fine? Having a good time? Yes. I'm having a good time. And you? Yeah, a lot. THERE IS A LOT OF TRAFFIC SOMEONE PASSES WHISTLING FAR AWAY, THE SOUND OF A JACKHAMMER Let's see… let's see what this world holds for us. - What about the traffic light? - Avanti! - Do we go in? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. Lollipops... Do you like cashews? - Not really. - Olives? These aren't olives, right? This is insanely delicious. This is great. That's gross. He doesn't like to work here. And I don't care. But... I don't know. I'm happy he's got projects, other projects. But I don't know. Whatever. Take all your frustration and multiply it by 50. That's how I'm feeling. Because of work? No. I love work. But it's true that he never does anything and we do it all. He's never available when I need him. I don't ask for a lot of attention, but every time I want to be with him he has somewhere to be or something to do. I think the show is overwhelming him. - I know. - It's probably that. I didn't know him before he had the show but I think he has to find a balance between work and everything else. Or between the work he likes and the work he actually has. You haven't spoke since Friday? Pretty much. Shall we buy this? - You're Pablo Iglesias. - You're a judge like Manuela. Which do you choose? A ''squatty potty''? - What's that? - What's a ''squatty potty''? It's a stool for the bathroom to help you poo. What the fuck are these questions about? The impro was going fine. Go on, go on. Awesome. ''Squatty potty''? - Know what a ''squatty potty'' is? - No. - What is it? - You know what it is! I don't know what it is! It's a stool... You put it next to the toilet to shit better. - Drinking again. - It is what it is. It's not fair, you're getting everything right. Yes. Exactly. We're intuitive. It is what it is. It's impossible that you both get everything right. - Because we're intuitive. - Right. Sara is really smart too. - I'm really smart. - Really. You should see her pictures. - She's amazing. - Shut up. - Is this your camera? - Yes. I'm still learning. She has to take some photos of you. - It'll be great. - Shut up. She knows how to do a lot of cool things. She's very talented. You work with her. You'd know. But they aren't things I could do at a party. They're... Shitty things. - Come on. - I'm getting more beer. Is this a musical couch, like the game with chairs? Anyone want to change places? - No. - Are you sure? It's heavy. All the movement... What? Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt. There are still guys who haven't made up their minds. You have friends, right? A lot. Not being a feminist today is to be deliberately stubborn. - Totally. - Is that me? Are you drawing me? - But it's turning out a mess. - No, let me see. I look like a good person. Yes, you're turning out nice. That's true. It's against the constitution that so many women die because of our legal system. - Against the constitution. - Yes. - It's a fact. - Yes. A funny thing happened to me the other day. I was having a beer with some friends and there was a cute guy, super cute. I thought: I want to marry you, marry you tonight. We start talking about feminism and the guy says, ''It's complicated''. Excuse me? Tell me about it, tell me about it. I felt so sad. It's depressing. Really, dude. I was amazed. Viole, it's supercool. Can I show you a trick? Draw a line for the mouth. Here? Can you see? It's for the cheek. You're my hero. - Thanks. - It's nothing, 50 euros. Can I keep it? - Really? - Yes, I like it. I really like it. Make a toast. No. You have to look me in the eyes. Know why people clink glasses? - Because of the poison. - Exactly. When you clink, you spill the drink on the other person's glass and it's a way of saying: I didn't poison you. Because people are evil as fuck. - Basically. - That's why we say ''good health''. - Someone here is getting intense. - No. All cultural protocols have to do with people being evil. That's why we shake hands: to show you're not carrying a weapon. - Nice to meet you. - I have no weapons. You see? People are rotten. Girlfriend. Sorry, that's the way it is. He does everything perfectly. He's intelligent. And I'm always, like, blabbing. No, you're different. You come up with other stuff. I don't know, I get nervous. I end up being like a silly kid who talks nonsense and does nothing right. I used to think everybody was afraid of failure. And that fear is the driving force to do things right. But now I'm a hundred percent sure that we're a generation that loves feeling like shit. In school my shrink always said… - You had therapy? - Yes, hang on. I'll you what my therapist said: tolerate uncertainty. Tolerate uncertainty. How? Well, that, tolerate uncertainty. It's a stage you must allow yourself to go through, to experience. Did he give you a plan? She. It was a woman. Sexist! Sorry. She. Did you walk? Yes. I like walking to places. Wasn't it too hot? No, it was fine. It's almost like September. Going on foot gives you a much more human perspective of cities. Besides, it's something typical of the city. In villages everybody goes by car, even to buy bread. I just read that walking cheers up the spirit. You have a lovely house. Thanks. A lot of maps. Zolpidem. That's for sleeping, right? Yes, I had trouble sleeping because I worked at night. - This helps you. - Maybe I should take Zolpidem. What's this? An antidepressant. And that one too. But sometimes I forget to take them. Did you want to tell me this? Did I want to? I don't know, I guess so. - How long have you been taking it? - Two years now. Why? Well, I was depressed. Okay, but what happened? I broke up with someone. A long relationship. Did this help? I didn't want to take anything to start with. Because I thought something would happen to solve it. But I started taking them and ten days later I went for a walk. I went to work feeling happy. It was like a commercial. - Really? - Yes. I think that if I had high blood pressure, I'd take meds for that. Same with this. I don't think there are pills for what I have. What's wrong with you? You sounded like Dorothy. Dorothy? ''There isn't anything in that bag for me''. - Dorothy? - The Wizard of Oz. ''There isn't anything in that bag for me,'' or something. I don't know. I think I have chronic dissatisfaction. Don't laugh. I want the clouds to part, too. And everything would make me happy. Well, medication is not enough. I started going to therapy, because. I felt weak, I felt I couldn't do anything. I couldn't enjoy anything. What's your story? Why do you have chronic dissatisfaction? Or was it a joke? No, no. I don't know. I think people are fragile. We should treat each other more carefully. And I feel that sometimes I've been unfair. But I don't think I knew that we did... - That what we did... - What didn't you know? I think I'm starting to realize that our actions can affect others. It seems stupid that I'm telling you this because you told me you were depressed. I should be more careful with you, but not just you. I mean it in general. We have to be careful with people. That's what I think. And I tend to leave a path of destruction. You're overthinking it. What's the deal with you and Pablo? I don't know. I guess there's something. But what's for sure is that we're nothing. Are you okay? No. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. You can talk to me, you know? I feel I'm not being fair to you. How so? Wait a sec. Maybe it sounds terrible, but I remember the day we saw ''Happy End'', the Haneke movie and we were in that pub... You know what I mean. A year has gone by. And we're doing this. I want you to relive that moment right now. I feel like I'm constantly missing trains. I don't know... You're a good person. I think I'm using you to... to cover things up. You don't deserve it. You deserve something better. And I feel I'm using you so I can feel better. I don't know. I feel I need the approval of a lot of people. And at the same time, I make an effort so it doesn't show. I don't know. Have you never felt that falling in love is insane? Insane? Yes, because you go from one guy to the next. To start with it's always exciting and fun. But bit by bit they become real and problematic. And... they get hurt, you hurt. And it stops being exciting. Everything turns sour. I don't know what I'm saying. I've had a bad day. AUGUST 21st - MONDAY. Okay. Well... I've been going over it all weekend and I came up with an idea for the back cover. It could sort of fold out. You know... like an accordion. And... I've selected some of the illustrations Clara sent us. Just to get an idea. I don't know. I wanted to hear your opinion. It feels weird being the one pitching this to you. I think we're talking about the book cover. And everything you're suggesting is cool. But for the cover, we have to go back to basics. Football, girls, those are the ingredients. I'm not saying it's bad. Not bad at all. I think it's complex because they're 13-year-old kids. They can be basic and whatever, but they're also smart. They can understand this. Well I think... I like it a lot. Thanks. I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back. But I liked it, Viole. - I want to see the rest. - I have to rethink it. But discuss it with the bosses. I don't think the author has a say. And we're just layout designers. They don't take us seriously. We should talk later, okay? Okay. We can leave together. Perfect. Whatever you think. Okay, but more like this? You're killing me. I'm sorry. I'll miss you a lot. Well, I'll still see you here but… I'm so sorry. This conversation is over. Not because it isn't great, I'm loving it. But I have to go. I have to go. I'm going. The neighbor playing the piano again, I can't believe it. Seriously? Another African music festival in Lavapiés. Incredible. Just what I need. I'm gonna run to buy the tickets. Why are you here alone? That's what they pay me for. Don't be like that. There are two empty chairs. A love affair at the office. Good or bad idea? What do our TV viewers think? Is it a good idea to get involved with someone at work? Send a text message to 5555. Whatever it is, I hope it ends soon, there's work to do here. Now you have to see her face every day. The sun pyramid or the moon. I don't remember. - Where? - Mexico. Mexico, Mexico DF? Cancún? No, it's in Mexico. It's where the pyramids are. - Done? - Yes, whenever you want. Okay, it's a wrap. So, we've finished the movie. In memory of Agnès Varda.
