A film by: with contributions by Bo Jonsson and Staffan Lamm. On 3 May 1968, a Davis Cup tennis match was set to be played in Båstad between Sweden and Rhodesia. This match never took place. The following film covers the circumstances surrounding this... Why did you want to stop the match in Båstad? I think that politics and sports really belong together, that sport has a real political function, that politics permeates all aspects of society and thus also permeates sports. I feel there is a tendency in our society to consider politics the preserve of professional politicians, government, party officials. And that the man on the street is somehow incapable or unqualified to take a position on political issues. But with channels of information available in Sweden today through mass media, we can actually inform ourselves well enough to be able to adopt a political position. This tendency causes many people, under the pretext of so-called objectivity, to become passive, to become apolitical. And I think that’s absurd, because that means they renounce a democratic opportunity to change society. I want to change society, that’s why I feel it’s so important to protest against this match. Our neutrality policy does not condemn us to silence. Silence can be the ally of injustice. Silence can be seen as supporting reaction. We must have the right to assert the ideals of universal freedom and fellowship of solidarity and justice. Let our opponents on the right beware: don’t try to use neutrality as a cover to muzzle the Swedish labour movement. You will never succeed. OLAF PALME Minister of Education GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL What do I think? They should cancel the match. But whether the sports association decides to do that is another question. But what are you going to do about it? - Well, what can one do about it? I mean, why should I do something about it? That’s my attitude regarding the sports association. If they were to ask me, I’d tell them what I think. Then it’s up to them what they do about it. ENGINE DRIVER No, I don't like it. Are you going to do anything about it? - No, I’m not. That’s up to the ones who… I mean… I have no... I’m not going to personally do anything about all this. But I am of the opinion that the match shouldn’t be played. Why? Because I feel that the racial policy in Rhodesia isn't what it ought to be. CEMENT WORKER AND HIS WIFE It should be stopped, of course. How? How? Just see to it that they stop, don’t let them play. Who is supposed to see that they don't play? Well, I suppose it’s up to the Sports… what’s it called now… the Sports Association to see to that. Who’s supposed to see to it that the Sports Association does that? Yeah, well, that’s just it, isn’t it? Can you do anything? - No, we can't do anything, no. Why not? We aren't powerful enough. Well, there are some talented tennis players who, it seems, are as bad at politics as I am at tennis. And what does that mean, Minister? Well, that's my position regarding this match. And those attempts that will be made to stop this match, how should they be viewed? I don't want to comment on that because I know too little about it. Above all it is the responsibility of the Tennis Association to say what they think is the decent thing to do. Is it not possible for someone higher up to? We live in a free country, so we don’t interfere in sports in such a way as to recommend that they do one thing or the other, With the Olympics, it’s a question of money, but that’s not the case here. DISTRICT CHAIRMAN SWEDISH DEMOCRATIC YOUTH LEAGUE (SSU) Peter Wallenberg’s dealings in Rhodesia are a separate chapter. It’s his company, his company is investing in Rhodesia Atlas Copco, we know for certain, and he is also the one keeping the Tennis Association afloat. He’s more or less financing it, and he’s also a partner in the tennis stadium here. That means that our protest against the Smith regime must also be directed at those industrialists in Sweden and the rest of the world who, through their economic ties with Smith, support this racist, fascist regime. HERMAN KLING, MINISTER OF JUSTICE It is not for me, as Minister of Justice, to comment on the policy of Swedish sports associations. The Swedish government’s policy is another matter entirely, and there is no doubt as to its position with regard to Rhodesia. TEAM CAPTAIN, SWEDISH TENNIS ASSOCIATION I feel a little resentful at the prospect of there being demonstrations that violate the law. As long as the demonstrations adhere to the law, then I accept them. I think it’s quite acceptable, but if they violate the law, then that has to be wrong. Are you afraid of that happening? - No, I am not. There’s been a fair bit in the press about activist groups. You’re not afraid that such elements are going to...? I’m not afraid, but I think it would be a shame if they were allowed to break the law. I see. You are aware that a broad swath of public opinion in Sweden feels that the Tennis Association has subjected the country, has put Sweden in an untenable position... I wouldn’t call it a broad swath. You don’t think it’s broad? - Well, I mean, we don’t know that. Do we? Do we? I mean, you tell me... RUNE JOHANSSON Foreign Minister They clearly have another point of departure for their assessment, namely that of sports as an activity that bridges differences between countries. But in this case, I feel that they ought to have shown more respect for the official position toward the country that the players come from and the public opinion that exists here that sympathizes with the plight of colored groups and the difficulties they face. Those feelings are very strong here. Do you feel that the Swedish government has done what it could to prevent it? Officially, there’s nothing more we could have done.… So you feel that you’ve made your views clear on this issue? Yes, the sports organizations cannot be unaware of them. They’re not unaware of them? No. But I don’t think there’s been any official intervention to influence matters. They’re independent organizations. POLITICAL SCIENCE STUDENT You’re part of the group heading to Båstad tomorrow? M-hm. Why are you going? We feel that it’s necessary to protest against white oppression in Rhodesia, and to really be serious about it. I don’t mean just walking around with a sign or expressing our views, but really trying to stop the match precisely the difference between a protest movement and the resistance movement that Stokley Carmichel and others spoke about. When you're in a resistance movement, you mean what you say, and you resist actively. That’s what we should try to do with this match. How far do you think you should go in order to put a stop to the match? First of all, these methods aren't something we're just talking about. We really intend to stop the match. Then whatever disturbances end up taking place, is up to the police. The most important thing is just to be able to stop the match. What’s your take on it? I’m going down there because I feel that this is a way to expose the political stance that the Tennis Association is in fact adopting by organizing this match with representatives of this oppressive regime in Rhodesia. Furthermore, I feel it is important to make it clear to the Swedish people that the political reality permeates everything, that it’s integrated into everything we say and do. It’s that great myth that society is divided into sectors, that there’s just a little part of society that has anything to do with politics – with elections every four years or something like that. What I mean is that politics permeates everything. Everything has a political relevance. And in that sense, this match is most definitely a political issue. These are representatives of a white, completely illegal, oppressive, fascist regime that are coming here and we can’t tolerate that. PRESSURE MOUNTING AGAINST DAVIS CUP YOUTH ASSOCIATIONS DEFY BAN ON DEMONSTRATIONS IN BÅSTAD BÅSTAD MATCH: POLICE PREPARED FOR WAR MUNICIPAL WORKER We don’t have much to do with it, those of us who just work. That’s more for the rich, who can sort of do more as they please. We don’t have much chance of making it into those circles, where they play tennis. So you think it’s a rich man’s sport? Yes, it is. Do you feel that the Tennis Association was wrong to bring the match here to Båstad? Well they’ve gone against the others… against ordinary people... that’s why there’s going to be demonstrations. My lady, gentlemen, I bid you all a warm welcome to the Båstad Tennis Stadium and the drawing for the first round of the Davis Cup match between Sweden and Rhodesia. The matches are scheduled for Friday, 2.00 pm, Saturday, 2.00 pm and Sunday 1.00 p.m.. I am now going to hand the floor over to Sven Davidson, who is going to act as referee and who will be in charge of the drawing. After which, we, along with the two teams, will be at your disposal to answer any questions you might have. Go ahead, Sven! The two captains have submitted their teams. Adrian Bay, captain of the Rhodesian team, has nominated Frank Salamon and himself for the single matches. The captain of the Swedish team, Birger Folke, has nominated Ove Bengtsson as number one and Hans Nerell as number two. I have here four slips of paper. I think we should let Åke Eriksson draw this time. This will be his 35th consecutive year at Båstad. He first came here in 1934. We now have the two slips of paper with the Swedish players’ names in here, and the Rhodesian players’ names in here. Could I ask Åke Eriksson to draw one slip from each of them. The two names that Åke draws are going to face each other in the first single’s match. Please go ahead. Adrian Bay, for Rhodesia. Ove Bengtsson, for Sweden. Would you please verify. Go by bus from… how long do you think it’ll take? Ten… It’s about 500km from here… That depends; ten, twelve hours maybe. Ten hours? From Stockholm to Båstad? No, each person will have to bring their own food. That can’t be organized. Maybe we can come up with some collective solution for everyone down there, that I don’t know… Thirty? That depends… forty crowns at the most. No more than forty, no less than thirty-five. The reason we’re going to Båstad is because we feel that this tennis match between Rhodesia and Sweden serves as a form of recognition for the government in Rhodesia, which we are trying to boycott and topple through the UN and by other means. And we feel that the decision that was taken to hold this match was taken above the heads of the people, of public opinion. The Swedish Tennis Association’s Board of Directors comprises representatives from Wallenberg companies, from Enskilda Banken, and companies such as Atlas Copco and Alfa Laval who are doing business with Rhodesia, even though the UN passed a formal resolution boycotting Rhodesia. That is why we feel this decision to hold this match in Sweden to be undemocratic. How many are coming from Stockholm and how are they going to get down there? There will be about a hundred of us, and we’ll be driving down in busses and in private cars. We’re setting off from here on Thursday evening and will arrive in Båstad Friday morning and will meet up with our comrades-in-arms from other areas of the country, particularly Lund, Gothenburg and Uppsala. You’re going to Båstad tomorrow to try and stop the tennis match? Yes, that’s right. Has this initiative been taken in consultation with any organization here in Lund? Or is it also in part a private initiative? There are several organizations here in Lund that are planning to go. And also people outside those organizations, but above all it’s the South Africa Committee and the Vietnam Committee here in Lund, and then the Ecumenical Development Group, to which I belong, is also going. Many of us anyway. According to reports, the police are preparing to do all they can to stop the demonstration. How far are you yourself prepared to go in order to push through your and the others’ decision? Well, as far as possible, that is until we’ve got what we… until our demands have been met, that is. That might involve breaking the law. Are you prepared to break the law? You’re going to Båstad tomorrow? Yes. What do you want to do there? Demonstrate against the match that’s going to be played. The decision was made yesterday to ban demonstrations. Yes, before six o’clock, but I consider that to be a provocation on the part of the police, since they knew very well that there were going to be many demonstrators. Are you going to demonstrate any way, even if it means breaking the law? Yes. Why is it important? In order to mobilize public opinion against the regime in Rhodesia. You’re going to Båstad tomorrow to stop the match against Rhodesia? Why? Because... I consider it to be my duty as a Christian to stand on the side of the oppressed, and against the oppressors. What do you want to achieve by this action? To stop the match for one thing, but also to disseminate information about the situation in Rhodesia, and to demonstrate that there is public opinion that is opposed to the regime in Rhodesia. How many are going to be there, approximately? From Lund, approximately two hundred. Do you think you'll succeed in stopping it? Yes, I do. It’s strange that a little community like Båstad can find itself at the centre of world events like this, all because we've got a few tennis players coming here. I can’t believe that it serves any reasonable purpose to pour it on like this; it’s always the innocent people who get caught in the middle and these players that Rhodesia is sending here, they haven’t had any influence on the regime in their country, and aren’t in a position to bring about a change in that regime. It's often said that you shouldn't mix sports with politics; and I’d say that’s something worth bearing in mind. You agree with that? Yes; it's not appropriate. TEAM CAPTAIN RHODESIA DENTAL STUDENT This Davis Cup match is a competition between the countries of Sweden and Rhodesia; the Rhodesian players are not playing as private individuals, but as representatives of the Rhodesian nation. All of them are white. The whites in Rhodesia make up 10% of the country's population. The white minority is engaged in the systematic oppression and exploitation of the black population. If we allow these white players to represent Rhodesia in a national competition, then I can’t see it as anything other than a recognition of the Smith regime, and I don’t want that. Båstad, which is usually rather empty and quiet around this time, is currently in the midst of intense preparations that, according to local residents, far exceeds those leading up to the big invasion every summer and the tennis tournaments. Close to a hundred journalists and photographers from local papers and international news agencies have gathered here, and the three permanently stationed police officers at the little stationhouse have been reinforced by several hundred colleagues from the whole of southern Sweden. But so far there has been no sign of the reportedly thousands of demonstrating youths for whom everyone is waiting for in anxious anticipation. Kristianstad’s County Police Commissioner, Hans Fjellner, thinks that it’s going to be a calm tennis tournament, after all. (Vietnamese national anthem, in Swedish) It’s the race problems that are responsible for all of this. The race policies in Rhodesia? Yes, that's right. Do you think that they’re right to demonstrate against it here in Sweden? How do you feel about it? Yes, I support that point of view… that they should demonstrate. That they should be allowed to demonstrate? So you hope that they are met with restraint? Of course I also hope that the demonstrators show restraint. That they conduct themselves in a dignified manner? Do you think that the tennis association should have handled this differently and moved the match, or simply not played against Rhodesia? I don’t think they should have played. You don’t think so? It’s the same as if you were to be given an assignment to carry out by your employer; you’d have to do it. We don’t want the match hindered in any way; we just want everything to progress in good order. So you think it’s in order that they go ahead with the match? This isn’t about what we think, but the duty that our employer has charged us with. Would you be relieved if the Swedish Tennis Association cancelled the match? My own personal take on this – not as a police officer, but completely my own personal view – is that riots must be avoided. Then, those measures ought to have been taken. That is my own personal view. As a police officer I am obliged to follow the laws and regulations, and the command structure that we have. But your personal point of view is - Completely personal. That... That it ought to be cancelled. They should cancel the match? - Yes. In order to avoid the risk of riots? Yes. Thank you. I don’t like blood. You cannot separate economics from politics, period, or view any sector of society as apolitical. You can look at examples from history, such as the Nazi regime in Germany, they had a very high-profile Olympics, which of course became a great propaganda coup for that regime. In that case there were no great protests, but one can imagine that if some effective action had been taken against the Olympic bid, that more people would have been roused in time and seen the danger of what was going on in Germany, and I think it’s just as important that we now focus public opinion on what is going on in Africa, how the same kind of fascist regime is being strengthened there. 1500 PREPARED FOR ROUGH RECEPTION IN BÅSTAD COUNTY POLICE COMMISSIONER: POLICE DEPT EXPECTS DEMO TO BE CONDUCTED IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER THUS, WE DO NOT HAVE PLANS FOR FORCEFUL ACTION ANY TALK OF WATER CANNONS IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS MASS PROTEST TO BÅSTAD PARTICIPANTS: DO NOT ESCALATE NERVES ON EDGE AHEAD OF MATCH You mentioned a pair of scissors. Yes, that's what we need. For what? To give these long-haired individuals a haircut. You'd cut off their hair? Yes, they need it! What do you think about what they’re doing? Well, it's all very childish... It's childish? Yes, it is. You think that they’re ruining Båstad? I think they should stay at home. What business to they have coming down here? They’re demonstrating against this tennis match. Well, it won’t get them anywhere. It won't do any good? No. Four unfortunate players come here and they have to suffer for it. How do we play against other nations? Spain was here playing football yesterday, right? It’s the same situation there as in… What do you think would have been the wisest thing to do right now? Well, nothing. Just let them play. Is that what you think? You don’t think it would have been wise to cancel the match? No, since the whole thing was decided by lot, it doesn’t matter who… Then it has to run its course. Absolutely! That’s only fair. Sweden shouldn't have to suffer for it. JOURNALIST, KVÄLLSPOSTEN It’s interesting that people are coming here, and it’s sure to be a very interesting day, that afterwards there will be every reason to shed light on in peace and quiet, in an objective debate. Yes, that's quite right. I have nothing against the demonstrations as such. I'm just afraid it doesn't do much to help the black man. But rather, when all this is over, everyone will go home, and the black man will be just as badly off. So, for my part, I’ve suggested that each demonstrator should carry a collection box into which they put ten crowns and see to it that another forty crowns make it in there. then we could easily collect, together, the sum of a hundred thousand crowns. And that we could use to bring over colored children, orphaned colored children. That’s what demonstrators are doing in the case of Vietnam. It’s a good idea, and it would have been great if they had done that here, too. But at the same time, I’ve suggested that the Tennis Association, as an incentive for the demonstrators to take part in it, make an initial contribution of 20 to 30,000 crowns to such a fund. But it was dismissed, both by the representatives of the Tennis Association and from the other side. But I have nothing against their demonstrating, so long as it takes place in a dignified manner. If they start fighting, that I don’t like. The right to demonstrate is something we should safeguard, especially when it’s been so well looked after over the years, especially earlier on by the Social Democrats. If you consider that the Tennis Assocation, which followed the National Sports Confederation’s directives that we are allowed to compete against any internationally approved sports association – a directive that was reviewed by the government just six years ago. If they had granted a walkover and Rhodesia had gone to Spain instead, then we wouldn't have been given the chance to speak our minds to say we don't like apartheid. By holding the match, we have been given the opportunity to say what we think about apartheid. Just so long as we do it in an objective manner. Can you stop this match with non-violence? As far as possible.. Is that really realistic? We’ll have to see. It’s very important to the outward objectives of this action, that it be conducted in a dignified manner. We are very, very aware of that, and have also worked according to those principles. But not to the extent that we’ll compromise on our goal. Of stopping the match. Do you think the match will be stopped? I have a hard time seeing how it can be done, but it’s possible. It all depends on what tactics they use. I am absolutely convinced that we will succeed. Are you sure that you can sort of control any elements that might get a bit violent? As regards those people we’ve been in touch with, we’re sure of it. And we also have some tools to help us in that respect, Such as our slogan: We remain calm when the police attack- in order to strengthen our unity, to ensure that any provocations fail. Whether on the part of the police, or those who identify themselves with the Rhodesian regime or the actions of the Tennis Association. Of course, but then in this context they ought to have blocked Rhodesia's application to the Davis Cup. Isn't it a little crazy when Rhodesia's application has been accepted... Surely "the show must go on", as they say. No, I don’t think "the show must go on". most definitely "the show must be stopped." We are not the ones who accepted Rhodesia’s application. No, it was the International Tennis Association. Yes, that's right. And then we have to play by our rules. What are your rules? Well, we’re going to hold a demonstration here in calm and dignified order. We're going to walk three abreast down to the courts. We’re going to stand outside by the main entrance. Then we’ll stand there until two o’clock when the match begins. If it does end up getting started. Then there will be people who have made it inside by buying tickets, made it onto the court, but they’ll have to… what they get up to is their own business, right? The students from Lund and others who are going to march with us, they'll have to play by our rules. Who’s "us" then? The Youth League of the People's Party and the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League.. I’ll call up the leaders for Stockholm, Gothenburg, Uppsala and so on. Everyone except Lund – Malmö. Lund - Malmö will go to one entrance, Stockholm and the others will go to the other entrance. And it’s important that we keep these groups together, that we follow these leaders, and don’t take any personal initiatives. Just do whatever they initiate. Is that understood? Yes. So are you going to join our procession? Yes. WHITES PLAY BALL BLACKS DON'T MATTER Three abreast. You can’t be more than three abreast, Those of you in charge, make sure that there are only three abreast. You'll be marching three by three! FREEDOM FOR ZIMBABWE LET THE STANDS BE EMPTY TENNIS STINKS Our ability to express ourselves has been sharply curtailed. There are very few channels through which we can express our views. We rarely get to be heard in the mass media, in TV and radio, and on those few occasions when we do, the radio management makes a conscious attempt to neutralize what we say by commenting on what we've said after assuming the role of interpreter for what we really mean, as if we were incapable of communicating that ourselves. Then regarding newspapers: Our time is marked by the shutting down of newspapers, which of course leads to a monopolizing of the print industry. We’re having a very hard time getting articles onto the main pages of the newspapers, in the cultural pages. Celebrity personalities like Jan Myrdal and Sara Lidman are really the only ones who make it onto the cultural pages. At best we might be able to get is articles in the letter-to-the-editors column. And those articles that we on occasion manage to get in there are drastically edited, certain sentences removed, thus changing the entire meaning, so that everything we say is skewed, and thereby used against us. There is no right to demonstrate written into the Swedish constitution, nor is there any right of assembly. That right is written into the constitutions of many other countries. Instead, in Sweden we apply a praxis where it is up to the police to decide on demonstrations. A police force is not a democratically elected authority. Its makeup does not in any way reflect the political composition of Swedish public opinion, and therefore it is completely wrong for the police to decide when, where, and how we should be allowed to demonstrate. This forces us to use other channels, and this forces us out into the streets. We print flyers that we hand out, we print our own newspapers that we sell and try to distribute in various ways, and we demonstrate. Sold out! Sold out! Sorry! There is no match! It’s closed there now. Next time. Salisbury, Rhodesia, next year. What business do you have coming here?! They’re boycotted by the UN... it was a proper drawing! But it wasn't... You dirty bastards.. What do you mean by that? Are we the ones you're calling intellectuals? Well, isn’t that what you are? We never said that. Are you Swedish? Yes. Then why don’t you try to solve the Swedish race problems first and give the Gypsies a chance? Try to solve that before starting trying to solve.. We came to see a tennis match, and you go and stop it. Did you buy tickets, too? That's exactly what I did. I've been coming here to watch the Davis Cup for years, and that’s just what I want to do now, too. Then a bunch of bloody shitheads come along and stops the whole thing. Do you think that the death sentences in Rhodesia.. What’s right and wrong, huh? What the hell do you think is going to happen if they get into power down there? There won't be any more death sentences. Oh no? Kiss my ass. Who do you mean by "they", anyway? We should just keep our traps shut here in Sweden. Let me try and explain Swedish neutrality to you. Like hell you're explaining anything! Here I’ve been working and paying taxes since the age of twelve, then you bastards run up in here - the ones we've been paying for, huh? Given half the chance I'd love to punch you out, the lot of you... The Tennis Association has asked me to inform everyone that there will be no tennis match in Båstad… Louder! Shut up so we can hear!! As we just announced, or as County Police Commissioner Fjellner announced… Louder! Louder! This is a genuine decision on our part – we are not going to play the match here in Båstad. I hope that you trust us on this. So there is no reason for you to stay. We are not going to sneak off and play here tomorrow morning or anything like that. I ask that you take me at my word. We've won here today and now we can leave. We’ll proceed up to the church hall, where we started this morning. What do you think was the most important thing about what happened here? Well, I think the most important thing was that we succeeded in stopping the match, that the match was really stopped, that we succeeded in doing that. That it wasn't just a public protest, I mean we actually achieved concrete results, here. I think that was most important. What do you think you've gained through your action? We stopped the match here and we got the word out, it's going to be on TV, on the radio, in newspapers... We've managed to tell a lot of people that the policies being pursued in South Rhodesia are wrong. It's a way of disseminating information. Many feel that you shouldn't mix sports and politics. You obviously don't feel that way. Would you care to explain that a little bit? There is no aspect of human intercourse that is without political consequences, political overtones. Even in sports, politics is involved. That’s how it is in South Africa, in Rhodesia, that even within sports, this segregation exists, so sports and politics are in no way separate. What was your experience? Do you feel your action was a success? Yes, I think it was a success, but it was rather disorganized. The fact that it went as well as it did, for our section, Stockholm-Gothenburg, probably comes down to the fact the police were even less prepared and more disorganized than we were. Do you have any comments about the actions of the police? Yeah, typical Swedish political police. How so? They always block things almost always, when it's leftist groups, or when it's against racism, they'll use the most brutal methods, pulling people by the hair and kicking them, hitting them. I think they’re showing definite tendencies towards what the Germans did in Berlin last Easter. Would you like to comment on what took place here today? No, I wouldn't. You’ll have to ask our superiors, they’re the ones who should comment. We are not prepared to comment. Not even a personal point of view on how the demonstration was conducted? As a police officer I’m not allowed to offer personal comments. You weren't part of the group that made it through the gates, then? No, no... That was only down at the lower gates. But what the news wire service is saying is that we were armed, with cobblestones and iron bars.. The thing is, if we had wanted to stop you, we would have stationed four horses and four dogs at each entrance. Then nobody would have... The police weren't much better than dogs. That's a pretty positive assessment, then. When a police officer punches a girl with his fist, that means something is wrong. That's enough exposition on this; Let's just call it a day. Yes, but there's likely to be repercussions. Let's hope so. I mean, it's illegal. If we wanted four horses and four dogs at each entrance, No power on earth could have gotten near us. I mean, we have the means. If we want to. So you didn't want to? That's enough, let's not discuss it any further. You can become a war criminal by alway following the rules... THE BATTLE FOR BÅSTAD HYDROCHLORIC ACID IMAGES EXPRESSEN HAS THE PHOTOS THAT WEREN’T ON TV RIOTS PUT A STOP TO BÅSTAD GAMES THE MOB ”WON” IN BÅSTAD EGGS, OIL ON THE COURT IN BÅSTAD INFERNO FORMALIN 'THE WORST SINCE 1909' It was mob-like behavior, something you would not expect to see here in Sweden. And the ones in the action groups that howled and rampaged and defied the police and others, they least of all achieved the effect they may think they did. Of course they think they’ve they’re smug and cocky and brave. But the only thing the police were doing, was protecting them. The rest of us who were standing not so far away from this mob, were hardly free to walk around, we didn’t know what would happen to us. Well, I mean, it’s a shame isn’t it Excuse me? ...It's a shame. You think so? I mean, all this violence and fighting – it’s a shame, isn’t it. Yes, of course it is, but the background in Rhodesia is also a shame. Of course it is, I mean no one likes oppression and violence, but… You think it’s a shame that the demonstrators were so aggressive? I think it’s a shame that people are oppressed. I think it's a shame that there’s fighting and violence. I think people should get along. Yes, it’s a nice thought. Then, I feel, that it’s difficult to take a position, either for or against. I see, but the fact that the tennis match didn’t take place, do you think that’s also a shame? I don’t think I know enough about it to say yes or no. Fine; thank you. I was actually involved, on the tennis side of it. Hired for the competition as an umpire. As far as I’m concerned it was terrible. It was a shock to see that people could behave the way they did. You’re talking primarily about the demonstrators? Yes, that’s right, the unofficial demonstrators, or whatever you want to call them. How about the other demonstrators? Well, I think they behaved absolutely properly, so there was nothing wrong there. Do you also feel that you can’t separate sports and politics? Well, I’ve been involved in sports my entire life. So I’d certainly like to keep them separate. Do you feel that that’s the right thing to do to do in the case of Rhodesia, where black people don’t have access to tennis? I can’t personally know what it’s like. There are bad things going on in various countries, that’s what we all feel, Oppression on one side and the other. We even do it here in Sweden. We oppress the gypsies. So I don’t want to pass judgment in this case. if you’re from a country where they behave that way then… Well, it's awful. Have you read the paper today? I certainly have. I’m going to read a few more. And do you think the description of the whole thing was correct and relevant? I do. But of course they do have differing views. Political opinions and views. Yes, they vary, They vary considerably, I think, actually. They're saying it's the worst since 1909. I didn’t read that newspaper, but I saw the headline, Do you also feel that way? I've never experienced anything this bad. I met Sven Jerring yesterday. He said he had experienced the Russian Revolution. and that was the worst thing he’d ever experienced, so far that is. but it was pretty close. This wasn't that bad, he said, We were certainly shocked. You think so? Absolutely. Many of us. What did you think of the demonstration? Didn't care for it. Not the least bit. Why do you think one shouldn’t mix sports with politics? I think they’re two completely separate things. Why’s that? Well... In what way? I don't know how to put it, Sports is one thing and politics another. That's what I think, anyway. If the demonstrators felt that stopping the match would help the Rhodesian blacks, do you think it was the right thing to do in that case, if they were firmly convinced of it? Is it right then to fight for it? Of course, if they hold a proper demonstration. But this was more like a riot, you might say. Were you down there yourself to look at it? No, I wasn’t. No. It's disgusting that they should be allowed to behave that way down in Båstad, that they should be allowed to come here and spoil things. All the disturbance they caused out there. Well, that’s how we feel about it, how most people around here feel, I guess. The local residents have been upset by their presence down here, their shameless behavior and all. They say that a number of Båstad residents went up to teach those demonstrators a lesson? Is that true? I don’t know anything about that. There are a whole lot of cars here. Do you know why that is? Well, they're curious. There was a bit of a brawl happening here. There still is. What kind of a brawl? The youths of Båstad are trying to get hold of the students, to teach them a lesson. Teach them a lesson? In what way? They don't like them.. And want to have it out with them. Make life unpleasant for them. Did anything happen yesterday? Yeah, from what I heard there was a bit of a brawl last night. A brawl? What happened? They used ladders to try and get up to where they were staying to get them out. At the station, too. They threw rocks at the Båstad kids, tried to hit their cars and that. There were a hundred and fifty men who tried to head over to the building, and then one of their leaders showed up and drove them down there by car which got pelted by rocks. A hundred and fifty, who were they? They were from Båstad and all around here. What did they do? They wanted to go up there and get them all out Who? The students. What were they going to do with them? I don't know, but the parking lot here was full of cars. Did you hear anything about it? I heard they were out here trying to get them out of the building so they could beat them up. Beat them up? How many were they? I have no idea how many they were. Like... twenty-five cars. Police cars? No. Ordinary, private cars. Where did those cars come from? From around here, around Båstad. So what else happened? Well, they went up there, but they were gone. There had been a police car up there earlier to pick up a few of them, they thought, but when they got up there, the lights were switched off, they couldn't see anybody. Were you here yourself? And saw everything? Would you like to tell us what you're doing here, today? Now? Well, we came to see what… …if there are any students. If there are any students? They say that there were students demonstrating here in Båstad against the match. Do you have any comments on that? I don’t think they should drag politics into sports. Why not, do you think? Well, they don't belong together. I feel the same way. They say that the demonstrators’ bus was destroyed yesterday. How do you feel about that? I think it's good. Why? Well, they deserve to get a taste of their own medicine, for destroying the tennis courts. They say that the demonstrators’ bus was destroyed; is that true? Yes. How do you feel about that? That's good. Why do you think that's good? When they come down here to demonstrate against a match, then they should get some payback, I think. Come down here all the way from Stockholm just to demonstrate against something like that, it's idiotic. Ridiculous. Why do you think they were demonstrating? For the rights of the blacks. Excuse me? For the rights of the blacks. No, look, I have nothing against blacks. I think that in the US, for example, there the blacks should have their rights, as they should everywhere. But I mean, they can't do anything. If the UN can't, they can't. They managed to stop the match anyway. Sure, but it doesn't make any difference. I mean, they're going to play anyway. It's a tradition. It's ruined in that sense. You saw the demonstration yesterday. What did you think was wrong about it? I did not see it. I was only there for a short while, then I drove home again. If they had to demonstrate, then they could have done it peacefully. And not gotten so violent. What do you think about the demonstration yesterday, here in Båstad? It was awful. It sure was; bloody awful. It was ridiculous. It was so childish, like nothing I've ever seen before. Why’s that, do you think? Well, I’ll tell you; because it’s absolutely unnecessary to demonstrate like that. I don't understand why. You think it was unneccesary? Of course it was unnecessary. What do you think of the demonstration yesterday? I didn't like it. You shouldn’t mix politics with sports. Those kids should have stayed home. Should politics and sports be kept separate? Yes, definitely. Why? Well, because if you can't keep it out of sports, you can't keep it out of anything. I feel the same. Politics, sports, separate. Why have so many people gathered here today? Well, I'll tell you we followed you here. We thought you belonged to that group, see. We spotted you along the way, And saw that you were headed up to Ekmans, so we drove into town and gathered some people together. You were going to beat us up? No, not beat you up, but if that gang had been up at Ekmans, then we would have stood there and stopped them from leaving. But unfortunately they ran off last night or this afternoon. I agree with the lady here, that’s absolutely true. We think they should have been forced to stay on, for at least one more night. What for? They ought to suffer some kind of punishment. I think they must have been very scared up there. Why else would they have run outside and hidden in the bushes? As soon as the people came up there, they ran off, out into the bushes, and they were huddled out there until we left again. And that's how they've been carrying on all night. We were up there with flashlights. They were afraid. Just terribly afraid. Did something happen yesterday? I wasn’t here in the evening, so I don’t know. But there were a lot of cars driving around here People were aggressive. Very aggressive. Why do you think they demonstrated? They don’t know what they’re doing. Just a bunch of idiots. Brats. Cowards. Why do you say that? Why they're cowards? If they weren't cowards they would have stayed. They’re all well-off, too, most of them. They live here in the summer. They ought to behave themselves. Why shouldn't one mix sports with politics? They’re two different things, completely different. In what way? Well, you shouldn’t… I can’t explain it, but they shouldn't mix sports and politics. Do you know why they were demonstrating? The thing is, they should go down there instead of demonstrating here. They’ve only got two players down here, after all. They shouldn’t demonstrate against them; in that case they should take up politics, not against the players down here. They can take it up to the government in Stockholm and talk about it up there instead. And then we’re going to vote for the right party down here, so we don’t have any of those demonstrations. Which party is the right one? Well, the Conservatives are, for me anyway. I'm not afraid to admit it. You’re trying to get ahold of the demonstrators? Sure, why not shut them up in there for a while? What do the police have to say about that? I don't care. We're not going to do anything to them. Absolutely nothing. We can show them how to demonstrate properly; calmly and peacefully, not like they did - coming at the police with iron bars and rocks and what have you. They got off scot-free. We had every opportunity last night to destroy that building up there, but we didn’t do anything. We didn’t even touch a single blade of grass up there, Have the police been here? Yes, there’s been plenty of police. What did they want? They just looked around. Was that wrong? No, it wasn't wrong... Everyone has a right to protection. How far do you think the police should go? Should they shoot? No, but there are excellent water cannons, stuff like that they can use. Did you see the demonstration? No, I didn’t unfortunately. …they were going to ruin the whole damn tennis court down there. And they were going to ruin things for the white devil. There was a black guy here declaring that. So there's proof of that. Why do you think he thought that? Well, I don't know. But that guy was going to university in Stockholm or in Uppsala, he had money from the Swedish state to go to school here, and have his living costs paid for. And he comes down here and ruins things for us, comparing us to Ian Smith and all them. I don’t think that’s fair to us… And for people like that to act like hooligans… why, that just ruins things for all young people. The clique that gets seen, they’re the ones that ruin things. Then it’s the decent kids that get blamed for it. We’ve been over to see Henry Swaving and signed a list that he's going to send the government, that the police should be given greater authority when it comes to these kinds of demonstrations. "Greater authority" - what does that mean? Well, to be able to respond with a firmer hand, when it's really necessary. And it is necessary sometimes, as we just saw. Do the rest of you feel that way, too? Y E S! You’ve drawn up a petition to the government. What does it say? HENRY SWAVING, GOLD MERCHANT Here's what it says. Due to the chaos that took place, and I am in no way a leader of the Båstad residents. I am just a citizen who wants to help other citizens. This petition consists of the following: We, the undersigned residents of Båstad, have looked on in dismay at the events that took place in our town in conjunction with the demonstrations that were held here on 2 May 1968, when Sweden was supposed to meet Rhodesia in a tennis match. The police made worthy attempts to keep order. Unfortunately, they lacked the authority to use the necessary means that could have effectively put a stop to the hooliganism. Therefore, we petition the government forthwith to provide the police command with such authority. If this does not happen, we fear for what we might experience in our town in the future. How far do you feel the police should go? How much authority should they have, do you think? I can't comment on what authority the police should be given if hooligans attack a community; That's for the government to comment on. Even if it means being armed? Then the government should make absolutely sure no such elements are allowed into the country, so it doesn't lead to armed conflict. Because Sweden hasn't gone completely communist yet, I hope. There’s quite a brisk flow of traffic out to an area over by Hovs Hallar, where some demonstrators are supposed to be holed up. Do you know anything about that? Yes, some of them were still there. These black groups, that belong to the FNL, who were very aggressive at the gates. Båstad residents got wind of this and really wanted to get ahold of those... types. Yesterday there were at least a hundred youths there. Then I went over there myself with the editor of the Kvällsposten, Buhre, his name is. Birger Buhr. Then, after a five or six minute discussion between Birger Buhr and this demonstrator, it looked like it was really going to turn into a lynching. Then one of the police officers asked if I wouldn’t get involved, to try and calm the whole thing down. So I showed a bit of aggressiveness, and told off a few of those stupid demonstrators and finally I said: Come on, people of Båstad, let's not be as disorderly as these rowdy people. Let’s go home and I’ll treat everyone to some refreshment. And with that, everyone came along quietly. KLING: NOW WE REALLY HAVE TO STOP AND THINK Has the police commissioner been informed about what happened? It was through him that I got the information I have, beyond what I learned through the southern Swedish press. And may I ask you then whether he has changed your view of how similar incidents should be handled? The police commissioner has clearly stated that from his point of view, a greater commitment of personnel could have prevented any violence from breaking out altogether. In the press the following day it was intimated that the police are going to be given greater authority. Would you care to comment on that? It was Kling who said it, that the National Police Board would be given greater authority. I find it pretty shameful that that's the first thing Kling has to say about this whole business with Rhodesia. One would expect that he, as the government's expert on legal issues, ought to be able to comment on the fact that we have signed up to a boycott against Rhodesia in the UN, about the breaking of the pledge we made to Rhodesia's colored population, not to support the Smith regime, and about the crime that allowing a tennis match against Rhodesia within Sweden entails. Everything else, the confrontations that broke out here before the match, are seocndary in comparison to the moral treachery that it involves to formally allow the Smith regime to gain recognition by playing a national match against Rhodesia. And that’s where I think Kling should have been upset, instead of coming along afterwards and being upset about secondary consequences. If the police were to use harsher methods in the future, what do you think that would mean? It's a very alarming development. But it seems as if things are headed in that direction. You can see it in a lot of different areas, if you look at the subway in Stockholm now, and the new city centre that's been built for banks and cars, not for people. That causes anxiety, because people want to have somewhere to go. But then instead of grappling with the root causes, they just try to crush any expressions of discontent through TV coverage and tougher police action. I think we face a period of difficult re-evaluation in this country, and throughout the West, and that it could be the beginning of a very unpleasant development, instead of facing up to the new situation, they try to crush expressions of dissatisfaction. KLING ON THE RIOTS: STOP THE HOOLIGANS I heard now that justice minister Kling made a statement in Svenska Dagladet, where he called us a bunch of hooligans. I find this to be a very worrying situation and tendency, because it reveals the enormous lack of information that the public and press, and everyone else has about who the demonstrators are. I think it’s really awful to see the role of the press in this respect, how they continue to fan these prejudices, how they’re engaging in a persecution propaganda against the demonstrators. The combination of increased police authority, increased police violence, and increased politicization of the police is what I find to be the most frightening. When you can see Sven Davidson, who is just beneath Wallenberg, giving orders to the police, who they should attack, where they should be put in, and at the same time the police just say they have no opinion on this, but are controlled by a political force, then I think it's dangerous to give them more authority. Instead they ought to examine what exactly the police are supposed to defend, what role they should have, and not just let them be politicized freely. That’s what Kling should be doing. The Swedish Tennis Association issued a communiqué that read more or less as follows: We will not reveal where the Rhodesia match is going to be played until after it has been played. Do you feel that to be an especially appropriate formulation? No, it certainly isn’t. Because ... ? Well, if you really feel compelled to play, what I would consider a rather superfluous tournament, then surely you ought to at least do it in such a way that people can see it, if they want to. No, I don’t want to speak at length on this, other than to describe the formal situation, and where we stand on principle. But like I said, they can enter the country and organizations are allowed to organize events. Without the Swedish government being able to stop it? Yes. Okay. Thank you. The match was ultimately played in Bandole, France. Final result: Sweden-Rhodesia, 3-2.
