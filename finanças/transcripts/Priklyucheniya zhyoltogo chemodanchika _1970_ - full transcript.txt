Central Studio of Children and Youth Films named after M. Gorky When the merry wind is playing with the clouds, You may not believe me, but a tale is just round the corner! I know that the wind has a favorite game: It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs. It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs. He thinks all hats, all hats, all hats belong to him, And carefree gapers are rushing in loads, trying to catch them. I know that the wind has a favorite game: It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs. It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs. I know that the wind has a favorite game: It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs. It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs."

Frenkel, the circus artists I'm sure, pills for a bad cold work miracles, but here l'm concocting a very uncommon medication for anger and cunningness, for jealousy, rudeness, cowardice, stupidity, for rudeness and for lying. A, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i... five by five makes twenty five. The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. "Antichattine" A, b, c, d, e, f. g, h, i... five by five makes twenty five. The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. A...b...c...d. Mo-ther was clea-ning the win-dow. Ma-sha was ea-ting por-ridge. Mo-ther was clea-ning the win-dow. We take a cherry syrup, add a funny word, And then we mix it very well. Now let's add a chocolate bar, two jokes and a riddle, And there you go - you can't stop laughing, as the merry powder is laughing and tickling. It's laughing and tickling. "CAREFUL! VERY STRONG MEDlCATlONS" "CANDY OF GENUINE BRAVERY" Next! Next! Morning exercise makes a whale out of a tadpole! Open your mouth! Say: "Ah-ah-ah". Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah... "What do we treat here? A silly question. We treat here your ear, nose and throat!" "We treat here children's teeth problems in a very gentle and kind way! "Stop whining and crying, please! The head doctor is treating patients here!" Granddad, our teacher gave me a B+, you know, however she says, that a B+ is the same as an A-. So I say to her, if a B+ is the same as an A-, better give me an A-, please. But I think to myself, no way... Close the book. Close the book at least for a minute. She used to never read. The doctor gave her a shot, and now she neither eats nor sleeps, just reads. I guess it was a huge dose. Does your boy have teeth problems? I wish he had. He talks non-stop. Did the doctor ask you if you picked fights as a child? He did. Next! It's a weird case. I got a daughter, Toma. I don't see anything weird about that. - She can't laugh. - She has had no laughs in her life? - Just once when she was little. From tickling. - And she never even smiles? No. Does she sing? Or at least hum tunes under her nose? La-la-la. At times she starts singing, with tears welling in her eyes. - I think I've seen you somewhere. - Probably. Your daughter suffers from a very ancient disease. Bingo! I saw you on the roof. I've loved weather vanes since childhood. - Yes, but at such heights? - What heights? I'm a pilot. What?! A pilot? Great. Did you pick fights as a child? Sometimes. Why recall such nonsense? I'm here about Toma. This is not nonsense. This is essential for science. Open your mouth. - Say "Ah-ah-ah." - Ah-ah-ah. Close it. - Who did you fight with? - Well... with hooligans. Defended kids? I was one against three once. They were picking on girls. - Who else did you attack? - I hated snitches and sneaks. Hold your breath, please. - Ideal heart tones. - I'm perfectly healthy, doctor, but my daughter... Very brave. Responsive. And assertive. All this proves my hypothesis. Bravery doesn't go alone. It goes with honesty and justice. I'll make a reference to you in my book. I'm about to finish a very important research. It's the fruit of my whole life. I was glad to meet you. - But what about Toma? - Don't you worry. We'll treat her. Sadly, her illness is still around even in this day and age. Sad people. But I got some medication for her. I'll give her a laughter powder. Bring her here. - Thank you. - Any time. And how will you call your book? "Fighting and Its Role in the Normal Development of a Boy." Next! A fair fight and standing up for girls supports a child's development. Bravery fortifies a fighter's nervous system, full stop. Doctor, I got Petya. He's very sick. He's... a coward. A coward? Wonderful! Wonderful?! You've misinterpreted me. Where's your boy? - At home. - Bring him here and quick. He won't go. He's too scared. Scared? How does it show? Does he go to school on his own? I take him there and come to pick him up. - Does he drink carbonated water? - No way. it fizzes. He's scared of bubbles. What about soup? I serve it in a shallow plate - he's scared of drowning in it. And what about dogs? Even cats make him run away. And another question. Excuse me, are you a coward yourself? Me?! No way! Maybe, you liked to pick fights when you were a small girl? I'm sorry. I got carried away a bit. I got one very strong medication for your son. Petya never takes medications - he's too scared. - It's quite natural. - Natural?! No, I mean it's unnatural, but natural for this kind of disease. To such kids I commonly give a medication that looks like an ordinary candy. However, it's not an ordinary candy - it contains bravery as its ingredient. And in a very strong proportion- 0.5 of bravery and 0.15 of fearlessness. It's so very scary to live in this world. Someone is fidgeting in the cupboard. I can hear footsteps all around me. Enemies are hiding everywhere. Maybe, the lions from the Zoo Are lying here in ambush? I hear someone talking in the hallway. What if it's a burglar? I would've gotten out of here, But there's some monster, hiding behind the chair. And behind the door - there's a giant, Higher than a lifting crane. He'll kill me right on the spot. He's so huge, with bulging eyes. He's as tall as a 20-storyed building. And he got 100 knives in his pocket. Petya, it's your mom. I'm back. Where are you, dear? Petya! Petya! - He usually hides in the closet. - Very typical. - Last time he got in the fridge. - Not typical. By the way, mice often live under the bed. Well? Very cute ears. And very loppy, too. It's already something. A snubbed nose is also an essential symptom. And cute freckles on the nose. One, two, three, four... Great. Come on, bend your arm. - It's a part of the treatment. - Let me feel it. Not bad, not bad. - Show me your tongue. - No. - Come on, Petya. - He'll stick a spoon there. Not necessarily. Say "ah-ah-ah". - Ah-ah-ah. - Ah-ah-ah. Right, right. Well done. Right. Very weak tones. Very shy and scared. I can already detect severe egoism at this early age. Bad, too bad! Why did he fall sick? No one ever scared him. I went everywhere with him. Didn't even let him go on his own. This is the aftermath of it. Where do you work? - I'm late again. I'm the head of a diner. - Go, then. I'll have to ask the lady next-door to baby-sit my Petya. I'm against all those next-door ladies. They only aggravate the situation. His case is way too neglected as it is. Cowardius Afraidus! What shall we do? 100 grams of genuine bravery candy, and Petya will go out to the playground by himself. - Do you hear the doctor? - Go. Mom! Don't go! - I have to go. People will be left hungry. - Let them be. - They won't be able to work. - Let them be. That's it! Go! - I'll be right back, honey. - Go. Well, Petya, brother, you're a nice guy, I tell ya. Now you will eat a candy. A very tasty, mint flavored candy. Oh no! Where's the candy? Alright, calm down, don't worry. It's okay. We're done for. Right. He didn't take his little suitcase, but my little suitcase. And I didn't take my little suitcase, but his little suitcase. Oh, what a broken hot water bottle I am! A shattered therm- Look, it's the pilot, whose daughter is constantly crying. He's brave as it is, but if he eats just one candy... - What is it? - Veryovkin. 30, Novaya Street. Okay, I have to go, and you stay here. - I'm scared to stay alone. - Let's go with me then. - I'm scared to go with you, too. - And what scares you more? - All the same. - Take your pick. - I'm scared to pick. - You decide. - I'm scared to decide. - Quicker. - I'm scared to quick. - Where does your babysitter live? - I don't know. - We'll try to find her. l'm scared. Listen, we're going to be here till the evening like this. A disaster might happen, do you understand? I want to go with you. - Remember: House # 30, Novaya St. - Veryovkin. Toma, dear, what's wrong with you? They urge me at school and at home, Toma, come on, give us a smile, please. But I've never ever smiled in my whole life. No matter how hard I tried to do it. Please, believe me, I'm not lying to you, I just can't smile. And that's it. Toma, honey, please, stop it. I won't. You will. I'll take you to a renowned doctor. Right, a doctor. Come on, Toma, my sweetie. All around seems so sad to me, animals and kids are hanging around so sad. Even our school principal is so blue, too. Please, believe me, I'm not lying to you. I just can't smile. And that's it. Sunshine, go take a walk, take a gulp of fresh air. - Please, go. - Go play with other girls. Go, honey. Please, do it. The roof is still leaking. - Right. - Let me talk to the contractor. - Oh, no. - But there he is, sitting outside. No way. You're very explosive. And you speak very loudly. You'll get me in big trouble. No, I'll settle it myself. In a quiet and calm way. You'll talk yourself! I can imagine it. "Could you be so kind, Ivan Petrovich? I'd be very much obliged, Ivan Petrovich". - I've put some sweets in your pocket. - Why? - Why? Why you bought them then? - Alright. Thank you. Dear... Dear Petrovich... Comrade Sinitsyn... Could you be so kind? I'd be very much obliged... What? You don't like it? You think I like it when it's dripping from the ceiling? When are you gonna repair the roof? There are no workers. What can I do? Get onto the roof myself? And do you want me to do it? Mrs. Veryovkina! Stop behaving like a hooligan! There's some old lady on the roof! Why are you standing, folks? She'll fall down from there. Nastya, your milk has boiled over. Oh, my! Mrs. Veryovkina. Anna Petrovna, get down, please. Could you be so kind? I'd be very much obliged! Hey! Hey, look. I can't believe it! Katerina, rush to your baby. He's crying. He's wet, probs. - Anna Petrovna! - I've been Anna Petrovna for 60 years! Novaya Street Come on, move it. Or we'll be late. - Wait. - Look where she climbed! I'll go even higher if needed! I fear nothing! No more leaking roofs. That's the limit! Follow me, if you're not cowards. Section 1 , Floor 5! We're being flooded. Come on! Let's board it! I'll show that I'm an iron lady and I'll get it done my way! So could you, please, do as I command? Section 1 , Floor 5! We're being flooded. Come on! Let's board it! She might easily fall down off it. - Poor old woman had enough. - She used to be such a quiet old lady. - Who is she? - Mrs. Veryovkina. From Apt.48. Mrs. Veryovkina! Mrs. Veryovkina, have you eaten a candy? Bran...brandy? A candy! And with its assistance... What? An ambulance? Why? There's been a slip-up. Come on, I don't speed up. Careful! - Is this your suitcase? - It's Valya's, my sonny's suitcase! A suitcase? You've never climbed onto the roofs before, right? Never in my life. - So you've never done it? - No. Did you pick fights when you were a girl? - Never? - Never. And even when... When I watched a weak one being picked on and felt that I needed to help... - And? - I was scared. It's natural. It's kindness that lacks bravery. Here's my little suitcase. And which little suitcase is mine? Alright. If it's not my little suitcase but his little suitcase, then this isn't his little suitcase, but my little suitcase. Let's open it! Not my little suitcase. Nope. So it's not my little suitcase, but his little suitcase. So this isn't his little suitcase, but my little suitcase. Let's open it! Not my little suitcase again! Wait. Sit here and get some rest. This is not my little suitcase. That is your little suitcase. It's really my little suitcase. Right. - And where is the candy? - What candy? The candy for bravery. You've eaten just one of them, so where are the rest? - My son has them. He's up in the air now. - The pilot?! Bravery candy?! An air crash is inevitable. Why are you sitting here? We're hanging about idly, And the three of us always stick together. We're so bored that we hit others on the back of their heads for free. Hey, sucker, here's a candy. Get lost, kiddo. Get lost, kiddo. We are street heroes, And we fear nobody. When we are three We will always defeat one in a fight. Hey, sucker, here's a candy. Get lost, kiddo. Right, get lost, kiddo." Our teacher gave me a B+, but she says, that a B+ is the same as an A-. So I say, if a B+ is the same as an A-, give me an A- then. But I think to myself... Why are you so scared? I won't eat you. I'm full today. - Petya! - Run! - Petya! - Petya! - Petya! - Petya! Look, Grisha, have you seen a boy here? - What does he look like? - He's in a striped shirt. - In a shirt? - Right. And he has freckles on his nose. A freckled guy? No, l haven't seen him. - Petya! - Petya! - Petya! - Petya! What's gonna happen to the boy? We got a very friendly neighborhood. No one's going to hurt him here. - Petya! - Petya! Doctor, dear, let's hurry to my Valya. What will happen if he eats your candy? - To the airfield. - I'm glad Toma knows nothing. Move it! And who is she? My granddaughter. A small girl. She's so cute, you can't even imagine it! Mom. My mommy. Why did I leave home? I could've been hiding under the table now. Or under the bed. And everything would've been fine! Where did you come from, huh? Get out of here. Quick! - I'll get you. Get him! - Quick. Don't cry, Buratino. Stop it. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Leave me alone. And why are you crying? Ah, are you scared? Me?! And why are you crawling on all fours then? - Get out of here. - Dream on. - Are you Toma? - How come you know my name? - And your dad is a pilot? - Right. He might get into very big trouble, you know! You're sitting here, and your granny rushed to the airfield. - Where are you going? - To the airfield. I'll go with you! But just as far as my house is. I live on Sadovaya Street, where the grocery is. Wait! l'm going that way, too. - Here. Let's take a shortcut. - We'll get lost. No way! Trust me. I'm sorry. Let's go! - Hi! - Hi! - To Semyonov again? - No, to the new houses. - Do you take the medicine? - 3 times a day. - Before... - The meal. Good! Stop teasing the cat! And if you were in its place? - Hi, doctor! - Hi! So? What's next? Why on earth did l trust you? Wait. Wait. I know this place very well. - Doctor! - Hi! I remembered! I witnessed such a showdown here! 1 against 3 guys. Well done, Kirillov! Where are you going? - To the new houses. - Want me to show you a shortcut? - Sure. - Follow me! Way to go, Kirillov! Well! What did I say? You can trust me. Thank you, Kirillov. Oh, my! We'll stay in this line till evening. Come on, let's get a taxi. Where are you?! Now we're first in line. I'll move to the front. I'm s... I'm s...I'm s... I got it. The boy tells me in pure Russian that he's sick. I'm not sick, I'm... I know kids' psychology better. We need to drop him off at ER. I'm not sick, I'm scared. You're scared to go to the hospital. Sounds natural. He's not sick. He's scared to be late. He is hurrying home. Right? Look, your granny! I don't know her. My grandma is different. She's so quiet. FOR BRAVERY FOR SAVING THE DROWNING BRAVE PEOPLE Sadovaya Street. The grocery. Your stop. I'll go further! Wait, doctor! Off duty. - Hey, taxi! Stop! - Off duty. What do you mean?! - Come on! Hey, taxi! - Off duty! How come they are all off duty?! Huh? Wait. - Off duty?! No way. - It's very urgent. Why are you so nervous? I'll give you a ride wherever you like. Who's been misbehaving there, huh? To the airfield. Quick. - Is this the airfield? - Right. Do you hear me? What a long fence! It'll take us ages to get to its end. Let's climb it. Climb... ...it? But you'll have to give me a leg-up. I'll climb it by myself. Hey, Toma! It's really an airfield! There're planes, pilots, air attendants here! Mom! We're hanging around idly, And the three of us always stick together. We're so bored that we hit other guys On the backs of their heads for free. Hey, sucker, here's a candy, Get lost, kiddo. Get lost, kiddo. Give it back to me! - Yours? - Mine. And what's in it? I don't know. - How come? You don't know what's in your bag? - Give it back! - Here! - Give it back! - Catch! - Give it back! The teacher gave me a B+... - Check, what's in it. - Stop it! Don't open it! "Laughing powder" "Antichattine" Almost an A. It smells of lemon, and of orange, too. It makes bubbles in the mouth, and tickles your nose. Give it to me! - Give the suitcase to me! Alright. - Give it back! - Get lost! - Show what's there! - Give it to me! No more suitcase! - What are you doing! - Why did you do it to her?! - Look at you! Hooked up with a cry-baby! - She's not a cry-baby! - Yes, she is. What a huge nose! Like a 2-storyed house. - If I were not so sure, I'd think... - Later! Isn't there a gate in this fence? Or a gap? There must be something. Like in any fence. And there's no one to ask. Wait. A boy is coming this way. Look, is there any gate in it? A fight! Show me your little nose. It's not my fault! l didn't pick this fight. You have to be really brave to smash his nose like this. This is my Dad! l know it's him! You found the right place where to play! He could... We need to see your boss. The biggest boss. - Who? - The biggest boss. Won't this eternal, infinite fence ever end? We can get over it. - What did you say? - I say: we can get over it. Anna Petrovna, as a doctor, I think that to get over it at your age... Come on, climb up here, don't be scared. Come on! Don't be scared! Come on! Do it! Considering the fact that the last time I climbed a fence in 1915, it's... - Right... - Come on. That's it. That's it. Stay there. Your leg! Right. Well done! Come on! Come on! Good for you! I'm proud to admit that my medication works wonders! Oh, my God! How did l climb up here? What's wrong with you? - I'll never get down from here. - Anna Petrovna. Are you alright? The candy stopped working. Oh, what a broken hot water bottle I am! A shattered thermometer! I should've foreseen that. Attention! A report from Ceylon. The flight is canceled. Ceylon is now affected by a cyclone. - A TU-Three-O-Four is landing now. - In Cairo will land a TU-One-O-One. Two hippos are boarding on the next flight, so bring the best pilot to the site. - Navigator Eagle is ill, what to do? - Pilot Sparrow will join the crew. Attention, Flight Seven-Five-Two, A pioneer squad is waiting for you. IL-62, IL-62. Careful, IL! Monkeys and crocs are on board, that's not a drill! A flight to Japan - preparing for landing. Pilot Veryovkin... What kind of candy? - In red shining wrappers. - In red wrappers. In red wrappers. 403rd, it's the command post. Do you copy me? Over. It's 403rd. I copy you. My dad. 403rd, did you eat candy today? What? What candy? Cut it. No "what's". Did your mom give you candy today? Yes, she did. What's this? 403rd, did you eat the candy? 403rd, what's happening with you? Over. 403rd, 403rd. He's not answering. Don't take me, the old woman, to the airfield. Please. Leave me here. Anna Petrovna, we're almost there. I'm too tired. Run on your own, I'm of no help to you. I remember! We're saved! A candy! Open your mouth! Don't! Open your mouth, I say. Okay. Keep it open. Chew it. Chew it well. Right. So, so... So? So, so, so? So? Right... Right... Right! Good! Alright! Why are you sitting here?! Follow me! Here we go! - 403rd, do you copy? Answer me. - It's 403rd. 403rd, did you eat that candy? - No, I didn't. - What's going on? Are you all right? Yes, I am. I'm practicing the reversed piloting. Maybe you've eaten just one candy? Don't you even touch them. I forbid you. - I don't even have them. - Where are they then? - I gave them to my friend. - A pilot? No. He works in the circus. Probably, Uncle Fedya. You see, there's no reason to worry. Who is he there? A magician, clown? - He's a tamer. - And who does he tame? Doggies? - Tigers. - Tigers... What?! Give these guys a ride to the circus. Yes, sir! Hop in. Charlie, a waltz. Charlie, up! Bravo, Charlie! Up! Up! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Up! To my heel! Up! Up! Up! - Three tickets, but please hurry. - What tickets? The show has already started. Uh, you see, the thing is... - Is it possible? - We've sold out. - Has Fyodor Bulankin the tiger tamer performed yet? - I don't know. Let's try it again. - You can't be here. - Where are you going? Let's hide. They forbade Bulankin to let out Luda the Maneater on the arena. - I absolutely agree. - Here! But he says: "l'll do it anyway, and l'll perform this deathly trick, too." Something's going on with him today. Are we late? Quick, quick! Install it properly. Wait. - Luda will go last. - Maybe you shouldn't do it? Calm down. Let's go. This is Uncle Fedya. He's eaten all the candy. It's a total failure! They're all too scared. It'll work out fine. Do you think I achieved it all at once? Here, eat a candy. We need to do something about it. - Has the tamer performed yet? - Fyodor Bulankin? - He's just starting his act. - There might be a disaster. Follow me, please. Why does everyone need Bulankin today? Now performing: the renowned tamer of the wild beasts Fyodor Bulankin! With a group of Bengalese tigers! Luda! Why are you angry? Go, Luda! Luda! Luda. Luda, up! Up, Luda! Luda, freeze! Go! Has the tamer performed yet? Jerry! So? - Not here. - Let's go backstage. Jerry, back to your place! - They can't disappear here. - It's all very weird. Oh, where's my Petya? - Let's check there. - Okay, let's go. Toma, I have a plan. Unwrap the candy! Let's give them the candy and when it gets too dangerous... - Over here! - Doctor, over here! - Here they are! - Quick! My Petya has never gone anywhere by himself. - They're gone again. - Where are they? Look. A deathly trick! The tamer in the tiger's mouth! Over here! One, two, heave! One, two, heave! - Uncle Fedya. - Have you eaten a candy? I've eaten nothing. Get out of here! - This girl's from our neighborhood! - And you know the guy, too! Get the kids out of here! The tigers are not obeying. I had no idea they're circus artists. Kids in the cage! Way to go!! - Well done! - Way to go! - Well done! - Way to go! You have such a brave son. And you got such a cheerful girl! Very good candy! Oh my! They turned out a very hazardous medication! I'm afraid now. What are you talking about, dear? - Are you all right? Sit down, doctor. - What's wrong with you? Have a seat. - Water... - Water, please. No! I will make use of this wonderful medication in my practice anyway! It's no secret, and everyone knows it: you can become brave without any candy! And to laugh your head off you don't need any powder, What you need is a fairytale with a happy ending. When the merry wind is playing with the clouds, You may not believe me, but a tale is just round the corner! I know that the wind has a favorite game: It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs. It likes to twirl weather vanes on the roofs, on the roofs! THE END
