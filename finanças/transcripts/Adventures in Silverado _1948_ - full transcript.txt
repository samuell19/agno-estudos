If there be a story in this new country, then I shall find it and write it for the world to read. It must be remembered that we are here in the land of stage drivers and highwaymen. A land, in that sense, like England 100 years ago. Are we nearing Silverado, sir? - Yes, we should be there in a f few minutes. A beautiful state, your California. - First visit? - Yes. My health hasn't been any too good. #I thought a change of climate might help. It sometimes does. You're Englishsh, aren't you? - I'm a Scot. Forgive me if I seem inquisitive, but what are you always writing in that book? - Notes. I sling ink. - You sling ink? I'm a sort of writer. - Oh. Heh- heh- heh. What kind of things do you write? - Oh, a bit of everything. Verse, essays, fiction. - You'll ind plenty to write abobout he. By the way, we haven't introduced ourselves. My name's Dr. Henderson. I live in Silvera. - Stevenson is my name. Robert Louis Stevenson. Hyah! I'd like to get my peepers on that no- good bandit just once. Yes, sir! It'd be the last time. - From the talk I hear, you'll need eyes in the back of your head. The Monk can pop up from anywheres. Who knows? He might be up there right now behind the Doc's trunk. - Where? Aw, now, Zeke, you stop plaguin' me. Aw, stop f fussin', Jake. Rest your shootin' finger. We're out of his territory now. Besides, we ain't carryin' no gold. That's all the Monk ever steals. Let's go there, boy! Hyah! Hyah! I've heard some lurid stories of your Western highwaymen. But of course I've never seen one in action. Neither have I. Except once. A couple of years ago a man came in my office and complained of an upset stomach. I told him to te something for it. He did. My money. Are they really as despepete as they sound? Oh, I guess they'd shoot you soon enough if you didn't hand over your valuables. We had a bad one operating north of Silverado a while back, called the Monk. - Why the Monk? He always wore a sort of a Monk's robe, though I'm sure he had no official right to it. - And what happened to him? I don't know, unless they've caught up with him since I've b bn gone. I've been in San Francisco. Hey. What's that rig down there? Strange rig to me. Hey, what do you think of this country, Big Fella? Ah. Hey, Utah. Don't be crowdin' Arizona. Come on. Hey, wait a minute. That stage is new. If that gringo thinks he's gonna set himself up in business in Silverado against us, he's... Come on, boys! Stretch! Hyah! This driver seems to be in a great hurry. Yes, when Zeke wants to get somewhere, he does, if he has to break a neck doing it. Somebody's crowdin' us, boys. Spread 'em out, Big Fella! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Tim! Tim! Zeke's coming into town. - Hyah! That's where I stop, stranger. Move up. Sure, if you'll tell me where the stable is. What are you doing in Silverado with a stage outfit? Just told you, lookin' for a livery stable. Yeah? What else? Silverado. - Yep, this is it. Get down off that seat. I said get down off that seat. What do you want? - What...? Well, what's the Foss Stage Company? That's me. President, secretary, treasurer, and driver. That's me, Tim Quong. President, secretary, treasurer, and bartender at Quicksilver Saloon. Hello. Figure on settin' up headquarters in Silverado, huh? Maybe. - Well, I say you don't. One line's all this town can handle. I don't know. It's a free country. There's not enough business for two outfits. Then maybe you'll telllle where the stable is. End of the street. Beyond that, the road leads ououof town. - Meaning I should take it? Thank you, Miss. Not much to worry about from a rig like this, anyway. Looks more like a sideshow wagon. When's the circus coming to town, fella? Soon as they find enough wind to fill their balloonsns From the looks of things, they shouldn't have too o ch trouble hereabouts. What do you mean? Nothing. Forget it. Wait a minute. I don't want to forget it. Tell me, you dye them horses in the same tub with a patchwork quilt? All that color musttdazzle you. What's the matter, tongue-tied all of a sudden? I'm only interested in getting my horses fed. - Horses? You call them horses? That white one up there looks more like a camel. Big Fella? Why, he'd run the legs off any horsrsin this state if I'd let him. That's what you say. I got $500 here says my hitch can beat yours to the crossroads and back. I'm not a betting man. - You're so sure your horse can win... It's a mile to the crossroads. His hitch'll never hold up. Ten dollars of my money says Zeke beats him. - How about it, stranger? Easiest 500 you ever picked up. Make that $437 and you got yourself a bet. Well, happy day. - This gentleman here can hold the stakes. That's good enough for me. Here you are, Tim. Hang on to that. I'll be back for it later. Are you ready? Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah. Hyah! Hyah! I should like to wager a pound on the stranger. Hyah! Come on! - Let's go, Big Fella! You want to see that newcomer lose the works, don't you, Jeannie? What do you think, Doc? Hyah! Come on, boy! Stretch 'em out, Big Fella! Let's go! Go, boys! Go, Big Fella, go! Come on, now! Come on! Attaboy! Come on! Hyah! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Hyah! Take it easy, boy. Did it hurt him much to move him? There was nothing else to do. - How bad is he? I hate to tell you this, but it looks pretty hopeless. You aun't mean that, Doc. - I'm afraid I do. The leg's badly torn where the lead shaft went through. There's only one thing for you to do. Shoot Big Fella? Oh, I couldn't do that. I'd as leave shoototyself. You gotta think of something, Doc. Anything. Look, when you... When you fixed my hand, you didn't cut my arm off, you patched it up. Can't you do as much for Big Fella? Well, I can keep on trying. He's liable to suffer a great deal for nothing. You understand I'm not a veterinary. This is a little out of my line. I know, but I'm sure he'd want you to try. All right. We've done all we can for him tonight. We'll see how his leg looks in the morning. - Thanks, Doc. I'll say this, he's taking it like a champion. Like the fella said, the more I see of people, the better I like horses. - Yeah. Take it easy, Big Fella. You're gonna be all right. Yeah, Big Fella, you're gonna be all right. Coming? - No, I guess I'll bunk here. Losing that bet cleaned me out. I haven't even got money to pay your bill. Forget about my bill. As for tonight, there's an extra bed at my place. - Well, thanks. Why are you doing all this for me, Doc? I like the way you like horses. Good night, Big Fella. See you tomorrow. Well, Mr. Foss... - The first name's Bill, Doc, unless you want me to call you Dr. Henderson. - Right. Bill. Ooh, did I hurt you? Better do it this way for a while. Where do you hail from, Bill? - All over. Name a state. - Drifter, eh? - Yeah. Too bad you got that brand-new stage all smashed up. Well, I don'n'care about that. If Big Fella pulls through, I'll still have my horses, and they're what count. I can always buy another coach, if I get enough money. Hold it, will you, Doc? You're proud of that whole string, aren't you? If I could live on hay, I'd eat with them. Say, I've got some of the finest wine here from Napa Valley. This'll make you sleep a lot better. Sit down. How'd you come to choose Silverado as a place to start a stage line? I didn't't That was Zeke's idea. I was headed north to Eureka. Then why didn't you say so? My business is my business, Doc, not Zeke's nor anybody else's. That sideswiping was no accident, was it, Bill? Why do you say that? I know Zeke Butler. He's too good a stage driver. No, it was no accident. - I thought so. You let him collect the bet. - Well, there was no proof. No proof? - You know what happened. - You could punch it out of his hide. Maybe I... Think I'll turn in. You're not gonna let that fella make you crawl, are you, Bill? I just don't want any trouble. The Monk? Operating again? Well, Mr. McHugh, are you sure? - Sure I'm sure. Same description according to my driver. Took one of my gold shipments less than two weeks ago. - How can I help you? We're a long way from your Last Dog mine. That's w why I think I can fool that bandit. I'll send out the next gold shipment on a regular stage run through Silverado. As far as your driver will know, he'll only be picking up a package of tools to take from the mine to Calistoga. I'll have Zeke Butler handle it. - If that doesn't trk the Monk... I'll let you know when a little later. Good morning, Jeannie. - Good day, Mr. McHugh. Good morning, Mr. Foss. - Sorry I had to disappoint you about taking that road out of town. - I'd like to explain about that. Where can I find Mr. Manning? - There is no Mr. Manning. The sign outside says "J. Manning." I'm J. Manning. You? You run this stage line, a woman? Business isn't exclusively a man's work. That explains a lot. - A lot of what? Why you were so fired up to have Zeke turn me out of my money. Wouldn't you be, Mr. Foss? I told you the truth yesterday when I said there wasn't enough business in this town for two lines. Naturally, I don't want some rival company cocoming in to try to crowd me out. My father left me this company. It's all I have. It isn't always easy to make it pay, but it's my only bread and butter. And I intend to always fight to keep it running. I sure approve of the way you do it too, Miss. I'm not sorry you lost your bet, because you had a fair chance, but I am sorry about your horse. I can't understand how that accident could have happened. I'll just write it down to experience. What was it you wanted to see me about, Mr. Foss? Not a thing. - Yes, there was. Bill's looking for a job. Bill, Jeannie here's one of our finest and squarest girls in Silverado. One of the prettiest too. I'm sure she's got a job for you. - I'll find work. Bill's still got five horses, good ones too. Why don't you put him on hauling water over at Squatter Flats? Why, it's up to Mr. Foss. So far, he hasn't asked for a job. That way you might make enough money to pay me my bill. Where do I start? - See Sam Perkins at the livery stable. He'll tell you what to do. - Much obliged, Miss Manning. Thanks, Doc. I can understand his needing a job, but he's about the most unpleasant man I I've ever met. Jeannie, you being the owner of Silverado Express, he got theherong opinion of you. You'll need to change it. I'm not interested in his opinion of me. But I can't understand how I let Zeke talk to him that way yesterday. Well, even if Zeke were rightht Still, if I were a man, I'd... - I don't know, Jeannie. He doesn't seem like the kind that would back down. Maybe he's got a particular reason of his own for not wanting trouble. Did that bank draft of mine come in this morning? - Yeah. How do you want it? The usual way. How do you manage to spend so much money, Doc? The same old story, Jeannie. Wine, women, and song. Tim Quong's fan- tan game. Fleeces me all the time. I hope you realize you've been "fleeced" quite a bit this month. Jeannie, you know everything. Every time you get one of those dividend checks, the squatters from the Flats start spending money all over town. - Maybe they foun. One that smokes a pipe. Oh. Something about that Bill Foss I forgot to tell you, Jeannie. He never was going into business in Silverado. He was just passing through. You know them squatters will be sure glad to get this water. You know, most m m don't seem to stick long on this job. I guess I can stand it if my horses can. - Well, good luck to you. How's Big Fella coming along, Doc? I'm doing everything I can for him, Bill. I want you to quit acting like an old brooding hand. All right. You're the doctor. - Yeah. See you tonight. Boy, you s se look natural walking. Here. Buy yourself a cold beer. Yeah. You'll need it in Squatters Flats. Hyah! There you are, Lucy. You're going to be up and about in a few days. Are you sure, Doctor? - Of course I am. You don't need to worry. She's going to be all right. I want you to give her plenty of water and a tablespoonful of this every four hours. - Yes, sir. And just to take the taste awayay I want you to give her one of these after each dose. I brought these all the way from San Francisco for you. Thank you. Animalalrackers. A horse. Oh, I wish I had a horse. Aren't you a little small to ride a horse? Not too small for a small horse. You be a good girl and I'll come back and see you real soon. Thank you. How are things, Will? - Oh, pretty bad. And all that water up by the Last Dog mine just going twaste. If we could only have irrigation, I... - You've got to be patient, Will. Maybe it'll work itself out. - It'd have to be a miracle. Those happen too. Take care of yourself. -Thanks, Doc. I don't know what we'd do without you. Oh, see here, Doc, you've done enough for us. I can't... Ah, you be quiet. This is just a loan until things pick up. - God bless you. Thanks. Hiya, Doc. - Hello, Bill. What are you doing out here on the Flats? The bulk of my practice is over here. How do these people expect to farm this kind of country? Well, I'll tell you, Bilil they're a mighty stubborn people. They came out here looking for gold, and when they didn't find it, they reverted to type. Most of them were farmers back home. They're trying to set root again. They sure picked some mighty poor ground to set roots in. Now, this is almost as bad as desert country. Well, it was the only ground available to them. The mining company owns most of this. If the mining company would only invest a little money, say, put in a dam or an irrigation system. Well, why don't they? - Well, McHugh doesn't think that way. Who's McHugh? - He's the owner of the Last Dog mine. You're sure interested in helping these people. I help thehe very little. About as little as water would? See you later, Doc. Whoa! Whoa. That tree's been cut. - Maybe it's a... Look! We're surrounded. A gold shipment. Hyah! How's Big Fella, Sam? - Appears like a mighty sick horse to me. Doc's in there now. What's the matter with him, Doc? - Infection. Infection? I hope he doesn't get any worse, Bill. - Yahoo! o! There goes Zeke again, always in a roaring rush. I'll need some antiseptic, Bill. While I'm getting things ready, maybe you'd better run over to Tim Quong's and get some whiskey. It's the finest use for alcohol I know. - Be right back, Big Fella. Of course you got to give the Devil his due, but if I'd have seen the pitch a split second sooner, the Monk would be layin' up there now wiwi the moonlight shinin' through him. Where was you, Jake? - Hmm? Oh, uh, my gun ja... Yeah, my gun jammed. Just when I had him dead to rights too. Did he do any shootin'? - Did he do any shootin'? Ho- ho- ho! - Did he do any shooting? Not after we told him what we'd do if he started to throw lead. Oh, we scared him off good. - Yes, sir. - And that ain't all... Seems to me with you dead, you couldn't scare off flies. Huh? - What I can't figure out is, how he always knows who's carrying gold shipments. Maybe he's in cahoots with some other fella. - We thought of that. Only one man held us up. - Where'd he jump you? In the middle of Blue Gap. That right? Poof! Disappears into the brush just like that. If McHugh told m mI was carrying the gold, I'd be looking for a trap. And you can bet your last double ned I'd have him nailed right now. Couldn't see his face, huh? No. Just his eyes. That's funny, I didn't see his eyes. Did you hear about the holdup, Bill? - I take it Zeke ran into the Monk. Doc wants a bottle of whiskey. Big Fella's got a bad infection and he needs it to clean the wound... - Oh, I'm very sorry. Anything I can do, Foss? - Don't know what. Thanks. Can I pay you in a couple of days? Don't worry about paying. Sure is funny how strangers and holdups pop up around here at the same time. Huh. Did you see that? I'd hate to have a fellow look at me like that and mean it. He don't want to tanane with me. He proved that once already. Hey. Maybe you got something there. - Maybe I have at that. Hi, Mike. - Hi, Mike. How's everything at the Last Dog mine? Howdy, everybody. Say, wasn't that Bill Foss I just saw going out? Yeah, that was him. You know him? - Know him? I'll say I do. Well, I don't mean personally, you understand, but I was in Salt Lake when he killed this man. Bill Foss killed a man? You sure you don't mean somebody else? No, sir. Killed him with his bare hands. Hit this fella so hard, he never come to. - Well, what for? Well, nobody seemed to rightly know. They put him in the popoy for a week, but when they couldn't prove the killing was, uh, what do you call it, premeditated, they had to o t him go. You're not making a mistake, Mike? - Bill seems a nice quiet fellow. Oh, he's quiet, all right. Always was quiet. That don't mean nothin'. Not when he gets roused. Say, you just watch out when he starts pushin' back his hat. And you were gonna tangle with him, Zeke. So our quiet stranger's a killer, huh? Seems to me I once heard that killin' and robbin' goes together. Yes, sir, killin' and robbin' goes together. Come on. Come on. O. You look all in, Doc. You've hardly left Big Fella's side for a week. Maybe we ought to do this later. Nope, I've seen him walk on his bad leg, seen the muscle action. I'm afraid he's gonna get well, Bill. - You hear that, boy? I feel as though I were witnessing a miracle. - You are, thanks to Doc. And good luck. And Big Boy's fighting spirit. Better take him on in, Bill. We don't want to overdo this exercise. How soon can I take him for a good run? Time will tell. And that's working for us now. - You hear that, boy? Back to bed. Doctor's orders. There's nothing so fine as a fine bit of horseflesh. Or a man who appreciates it. I think it's wonderful about Big Fella. - So do I. Bill, I've been wanting to talk to you. Yeah, any complaints? - No. If you'd make an effortt to be a little more friendly, people might do the same for you. My, you're a talkative one, aren't you? I like to be friendly. - With your horse. Doc told me about the mistake I made, that you'd planned your stage line up north. I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions. Well, that's all in the past, Miss Manning. - I'm usually called Jeannie. There's something else. You must know that people have been saying a lot of rotten things about you around this town. Like I'm the Monk or his partner? - Yeah. Well, what do you think? - You could be. But I don't believe it. - Thanks. They're also talking about how you killed a man. Yeah, I know. - Did you? Yes. - Why? How could you hate anybody that much? Look, you believe I'm not the Monk. Would you believe something else? Yeah. - I didn't hate him. I never saw him before in my life. He was a drunken section hand beating up on an old drink moocher in a Salt Lake saloon. I stepped in, there was a fight, and I hit him... Too hard. That's all. Now I can understand why you let Zeke bully you so much. Unless I have to, I don't want to fight with anybody again. As for Zeke, he doesn't bother me. I'll be drifting pretty soon. As soon as Big Fella's up to it. What'll you do? - I'm a stage driver, not a tank toter. I'm gonna start another stagecoach on the daily run for the rest of the summer. How'd you like to drive it for me? A lot of people around here wouldn't like that. It is my business, not theirs. The point is, would you like it? I'd like nothing better. - Then it's all settled. Your first run will be to drive me over to Squatters Flats. Doc's giving a birthday party for Lucy next Sunday. Well? - You're wrong, Zeke. Bill Foss can't be the Monk. - How do you mean, "can't be"? Did you talk with him? - Yes. He's not that kind of a man. How do you know? - I just know, that's all. The way he acts. A woman can sense those things. He's too real. Fine. Great. Some fellas can soft- soap a gal into thinking anything. Even like thinking they're falling for them. - Don't be as stupid as you sound. Are you trying to rawhide me? - I'm not. - You remembered Foss came into the office the day McHugh was making a deal for you to haul his gold. He could have heard erything. - I don't care if anybody hear or not Well, I say.... - Well, say it a little softer! Everything about him is suspicious. I'm gonna prove he's the Monk, Jeannie. I say get rid of him. Sooner or later, he's gonna spell his hand. Get rid of him? I just hired him today to drive the extra stage this summer. You... You what? - Better get your horses ready, Zeke. Your stage leaves in half an hour. You'll find out who's right. Sure a strange-looking assortment of animals. Where'd you get them? - I drove the whole West to find this hitch. The perfect hitch. From the Superstition Mountains to the Sierras. I named them from where I found them. The wheelers there are Big and Little Nevada. The stringers are Utah and Arizona. The leaders... On this side is Oregon, and, of course, Big Fella in place of that brown mare there. They seem to know beforehand just exactly what you want them to do. I'm whispering to them all the time, through these. I notice you don't even use a whip. - I don't need to. You're a better stage driver than I thought you were. Of course, handling a six-up isn't all a light touch. It takes a lot of experience and a pair of good strong hands at times too. Oh, I don't know. It looks simple. It's no job for a woman. - I bet I can do it. You? Why, the minute they got their heads, you'd never be able to pull them in. Let me try. Whoa. Slide over. They're all yours. This ought to be educational. But don't try and get fancy, now. Hyah! Whoa! Did I do all right for a woman? - Lady, you do all right for a man. Dad taught me how to handle my f fst six- up when I was 10. Come on, Oregon. Bill. I don't know how he got out of the corral, but I should have known he'd join us on the road. Come on, folks! Come on, children! Come on. Just gather around. Come on. Hi, Tim. All right, Will. - Lucy! Today is Lucy's birthday. Then I'm gonna sing her a song. Oh, boy! - Ohh! Very marry birthday Very marry birthday marry year like never before congatulations, dear, Lucy. may you celebrate in hand... Happy birthday, Lucy. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Lucy. - A doll! Oh, thank you, Mr. Bill. Oh, thank you, Miss Jeannie. Happy birthday, Lucy. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Stevenson. Now, why didn't I ever know this was your birthday? Oh, yes, you did. Daddy said you told everybody here. That's why there's a party. - He did, did he? Well, let's have a talk with your daddy. Silverado Express is arriving right on time! Hyah! Comin' right up, Doc. Stand back, everybody. Just stand back. There's lots of room. There he is, Doc. Happy birthday, Lucy. - Oh, thank you! Oh! Ain't he pretty? - Birthday cake. He's beautiful! Oh! Come on, Lucy, you better let me lead you around for a little while till you get used to it. Giddy-up. - That was sure nice of you, Doc. Burned myself. Doc. You've made her the happiest child in the world today, and all I can offer is this... This earth that won't even grow her bread. - But it soon will, Mr. Clayton. Not without water. That's one of the reasons Doc wanted you all here today. Better tell them, Doc. - Oh, it's not important. I... I made some inquiries in San Francisco about the cost of putting in a dam and an irrigation outfit. It would cost a lot of money. So I took the proposition to McHugh who owns the mine, and he finally agreed to put up half the money if we put up the rest. But where are we gonna get that kind of money? Well, I've arranged to get enough to match McHugh's half. It's sort of a loan. Doc! You don't know... Come on, folks, get your birthday cake. Birthday cake. Birthday cake, everybody. Birthday cake. I guess I'll call him Little Fella on account of he's not as big as Big Fella. Daddy says when I grow up I can have a whole herd of horses. I'll have a black one and a white one and one with spots and mamae a brown one. Of course, that's if I'm a good girl. Of course I'll be a good girl. Who wouldn't for something like that? Did your father ever tell you that part of being a good girl is not to talk more than a mile a minute? Yes, he told me that lots of times. I do talk too much, don't I? But do you know why that is? It's because I'm a woman. Lucy. I think you two want to be alone. No, not at a a. - Oh, yes, you do. I don't have to be kicked by a mule to know when a fella wants to be alone with his girl. Hey, now, wait a minute. - Me and Little Fella will go over and see Big Fella. They won't mind my talking. Come on. Fresh little monkey. - That's talk. You like children, don't you, Bill? - Yeah. And horses and dogs. You're a man who should settle down. Nah, not me. I'm a drifter. And yet you want to start a stage line. Well, that's different. You're still moving. And until there's a pretty big reason to stop, why, there's more excitemen keep on going. Excitement. - Well, now, ain't this cozy. What's on your mind, Zeke? - Too bad there ain't one of the artist fellas here to take your picture. Understand you've been promoted to driving the extra stage this summer. Anything wrong with it? - Well, I don't know. Trusting our outfit to the first hair pounder that comes along seems like mighty risky business. Might never see it again. Zeke. For a fiddle foot, you're comin' up mighty fast in life. Guess maybe your takin' a shine to Jeannie here gives you the idea she's gonna shine back, huh? - You better go now. I ain't takin' back a thing I said about you, Foss. A lot of other people in this town feel the same way. About the best advice I can give you, Zeke, is to put a clothespin on that tongue of yours, till you get some proof to back up what you've been saying. Heh- heh. That's just what I aim to get, proof. I'm sorry, Bill. All that talk of Zeke's about the Monk having a partner. Maybe he does have a partner. - Well, that's Zeke's claim. You know, have you ever noticed how a person with a guilty conscience is always quick to accuse somebody else? You don't mean you think Zeke had anything to do with Monk? He's never done anything dishonest. - No, not that you know of. Jeannie, on that next gold shipment, why don't you tell Zeke that I'm carrying it and then slip it on his coach without him knowing it. If you were robbeded that would mean that Zeke had passed the word on to the Monk. That's right, Jeannie, but we've both gotta know. My gracious, I can't figure out what a fella has to talk so long about with his girl. Believe me, if I had me a fella, I wouldn't know what to say just sittin' talkin'. But if you two think it's fun, it's none of my business. Ho! I don't go for it. I'm the head driver in this company. You're letting a greenhorn like Foss haul the gold? You didn't do any too well that last trip. I still say you're taking chances, Jeannie. Figure it out yourself, Zeke. The Monk would expect you to carry the gold. He'd never suspect I'd entrust it to a new driver like Bill. Yeah. Yeah, maybe when you put it like ththa, you got something. You might be right. Well, what are we waitin' on? Let's get started. Everything's all ready, Zeke. You can lead off. Lead off, nothin'. I'm driving behind Foss to make sure he don't get rid of Jake and just hand the gold to the Monk. Good luck, Bill. Don't get yourself shot. Not if I can help it. Come on, Foss, I'm waitin' on ya! Yessiree Bob, I'd like to get me one more good look at that Monk, I would. #I'd fill him so full of holes, you'd have to cacarry m around in a pail, a tin pail. The Monk ain't gonna pull no more shenanigans on Jake Willis, he ain't. No, sir, this time I'm gonna outfox him. What are you waitin' on, Foss? Get goin'! I said this time I'm gonna outfox him. #What are you slowin' dodown f? Thought I'd give you a chance to use that shotgun on the Monk. Oh, now, look here, Bill, don't go lookin' for troroub. Just let it come natural if it has to. Yeah, but think what a hero you'll be if you shohoot the Mo. I ain't aimin' to be no hero. I'm just here to see to see that this gold gets ththrou. #I hope. Ahh! What are you stoppin' for? You tryin' to get held up? If you're in such a hurry, pass me... #I'm here to see that the gold you're carrying gets though. Now get movin'. All right, you won't'tove, then I'll help you move. #Hyah! Hyah! Watch out for his feet, Zeke. #Ooh, ooh, look out! Ooh! Well, I got him in the shoulder the first time. #Ha- ha! Whatat I tell you I'd do if I ever got another look at him? I wonder how come he knew I was carrying that gold when I didn't know it myself. And just like it's happened every other time, there he is with that carbine all of a sudden popping up out of nowhere. He popped up!! Any chance of tracing him by this? Not much, Mr. Hatfield. There's one every other household. Tell him how I plugged the Monk with my.44 and saved the gold. Yessiree Bob, I hit him right in the left shoulder, and if I hadn't run out of lead, why, I'd have blowed him to come next Tuesday. We appreciate your quick thinking and your courage, Mr. Willis. As Mr. McHugh's mine manager, I'll see that you're rewarded. Thank you kindly, Mr. Hatfield. Thank you kindly. Is that the way it hapapned, Bill? #Yeah. I'd like to know how the Monk knew I was carrying the gold? I'll ask the questions, Zeke. #Jeannie, how many people knew you were switching that gold to fool the Monk? #Not very many. Well, how many? #Only myself and one other person. That wouldn't be Bill Foss, would it? #Yes, it would. Whose idea was it, Jeannie? #It was... It was Bill's. There you are, as plain as the nose on a goat. Maybe he ain't the Monk, but t 's in business with him. Would I be dumb enough to have the Monk rob your coach knowing it'd look like I told him? #Now, that wasn't dumb. That was real smart. #Sure, you wanted to keep behind me so you could keep Jake from shooting the Monk. That way you'd make sure he got the gold and you could skip the country with him. Yeah, that t unds right! You bet I have. A brainy fella like the Monk would be smart enough to clear out before it was too late. #Make him tell who the Monk is! I'm the one in charge here, Zeke. I'll do the talking. Yeah, and that's all you are doing. #All you do is sie down in Calistoga the whole year- round and never come near Silverado. So, what are you butting in now for? #I've had men searching for weeks. It took us to get a lead on the Monk. #Why don't you lelee us alone. We can handle this our way. #I've warned you... Rest your fritter. Keep him covered. #Just a minute. Now, listen to me. Speak up! Are you gonna tell us who the Monk is or not? I can't tell you what I don't know. #That's a lot of corral dust. Start talkin'! Turn around now, please, all of you. And release Bill Foss and stand aside. Well, I'll be a black- eyed baby bear. #Don't laugh, Zeke. I'm rather a good marksman. #And you, Jake, return the sheriff's pistol, please. Splendid. #Now we can all calm down and be quiet. I'll take it from here, Mr. Stevenenn. #If you don't mind, Mr. Sheriff, I should like to point out pertinent facts to Zeke and his friends. s. A, if you're thinking of placing Bill under arrest. He certainly is going to arrest him. #There isiso proof of his guilt. What? How come he knew the gold was in the coach? That isn't proof, merely grounds for suspicion. For instance, aren't you forgetting that Jeannie knew about the gold too? Why aren't you accusing her? #What are you drivin' at? Only that Jeannie would profit just as much by b bng in league with the Monk as anyone else. You don't mean that, Mr. Stevenson? Jeannie wouldn't have any part of such a thing. #Besides, there's no proof. No. No more than there is against Bill. #But it is a possibility. Yes, it is a possibility. Mr. Stevenson knows it isn't the truth. He's only trying to keep you all from jumping to conclusions. That's right, Jeannie. So before you start accusing Bill or anyone e ee, I suggest that you find a man who's been shot. Findnd man with a wounded arm and see what he has to say. That's a very sensible idea, I reckon. Thank you. #Maybe we ought to ease up a while. We'll find the Monk, all right. #We'll finish up this business quick no matter who's mixed up in it. #You fellas clear out of here. I ouout to run you all in. #Come on, get going. Let's go. I still think you fit in someplace, Foss. You bet he does Mr. Hatfield, right up to here. And I'll tell you something, Foss. You're only free until I cananet enough evidence to hang you. Yeah, right up to here. Don't let me catch you leaving town, Foss. #Thanks, Jeannie, for backing up Mr. Stevenson. #Things might have been pretty rough. Yes. #Wait a minute. You... You're not believing all those crazy things Zeke said? I'm not sure what to believe anymore. I know it's a pretty big shock to discover you've mistrusted someone. And I know I didn't tell anyone about ththgold. No, of course not. I admit the evidence against me is pretty damaging. Yes, it is. A unique and dangerous experience... holding a roomful of ruffians at bay. You know, without a loloed firearm, I never should have had the nerve. What's so funny? #That's my shotgun. I left it for Jake to fix. #The trigger's broken. It won't shoot. Hello, Bill. I was just stirring up the fire a little to take the chill off. Did you hear about the Monk today? #Yes. This afternoon while I was making some calls over on the Flats. I got to clear this up, Doc. I got to find out who's pulling those Monk holdups. Outside of a few exceptions, the whole town's ready to string me up to the nearest tree. Even Jeannie's not sure about me. #Jeannie too? I didn't realize it was that serious. Well, I guess I can't blame her for the way she feels about me. Doc. If the Monk was hurt bad enough, he'd try to get to a doctor, wouldn't he? Yes, I suppose he would. Where is the nearest doctor? Outside of you? Calistoga, I believe. That's pretty far. You haven't had anyone in here today, anyone who'd been shot, have you, Doc? Is there anything that makes you think I have? #Yeah. A sleeve burning in the stove. #A sleeve with blood on it. I took that out of a man's shoulder a little while ago. #Did you know the man? Yes, I knew hihim. #Who was he? I'd rather not tell. You can't cover for anybody, Doc. You got to tell. Yes, you're right. I can't keep it a secret any longer. If you hadn't seen that sleeve, I might have bluffed it out until I could get away. You? The Monk? #Yes. And I never had a partner, Bill. #I always worked alone. How did you know about the gold shipments? #There are always ways. The time before this, I seen McHugh come into town. It was just a guess that the business between him and Jeannie was about shipments of gold. Yeah, but about today... Nobody but Jeannie and I knew. Yes, there was another. A little friend of mine overheard yoyou and Jeannie talking at the Clayton party. #Lucy. You know how she likes to prattle. #But why did you do it, Doc? Why did you do all this? #Why? The Monk idea came to me after I started working with those outcaststs, the squatters, the remnants of those who came seeking gold. You know them. Will Clayton, Lucy, the rest. But everybody thought you had your own incnco. Only my story. That money that came from San Francisco, that was gold I had stolen. #I had it converted into bank drafts. Well, what about the money you promised for the dam? I hoped to get that from the robbery today. Nobody ever fixed a wrong with another wrong, Doc. No. I always felt that money would help those squatters to get along until they could get water. Now... Would you care to go with me while I give myself up? I'd better get going myself. #Wait a minute, Doc. We gotta think this thing out. #No, I've made up my mind. I want to get it over with quickly. #I've hurt you enough, Bill. Zeke's got this town stirred into a lynching mood. He's planning a big manhunt. #They're all friends of mine. They wouldn't do anything violent.t. #Wouldn't they? I've seen things happen like this before. #A man can be your lifelong neighbor, but as soon as you're wanted, you're fair game for even your best friend. You know that. Why don't t you wait till the town quiets? No, I'm turning myself in tonight. Sorry, Doc, but I won't let you. You can't stop me. #Come in. Hello, Zeke. #Listen, Doc, Hatfield and I are not waiting for that sheriff any longer. #We're forming a posse tonight. You want to join? I'm glad you dropped in, Zeke. I have something important I want to tell you. #Oh, no, you haven't. Why you dirty, yellow backstabber. Hittin' Doc, an old man. #This is what we finish what we started today. It's Zeke! It's Bill Foss! #They're killing each other! Grab him, boys! He just knocked the Doc cold. Knock his head off! This time you're gonna get what's coming to you. Anybody who hit Doc ought to be strung up. #Let's get a rope, men. We'll make him admit he's the Monk's partner. They're fetching a rope. They caught the Monk's partner. Did you hear that, Tim? They got the Monk. #Did you hear that, Mr. Stevenson? Somebody fetch a rope. We g g the Monk's partner. #Hey, Tim, they got the Monk. All right, let's get out of here. #Do you realize what's happened? These people have gone wild. They'll kill him. You've butted in for the last time, Stevenson. #You're not gonna stop us again. Get out of here. Where's that rope? #Stop! Stop it, I say! #Listen, you people. Stop it! Listen to what I have to say. #I want no violence. Please, no violence. #Can you hear me? He beat you up, didn't he? #The fight was between Bill and me. He didn't hurt me. #It doesn't concern you. You mean... #you don't want nothin' done with him? No. Let him alone. #What'd he hit you for, Doc? It was a private matter. #What was you about to tell me when this fist- slinger slugged you? #Nothing. Nothing at all. Please forget it. Go to your homes. #Maybe the Doc's willing to forget, but the rest of this town won't. #That goes for me too. Come on, boys. Jeannie... #You hit Doc. And Doc was big enough to save you. I began to have doubts about you this afternoon, bubuI haven't got them anymore now. You're a man who's capable of anything. You... Y Y don't mean you think I... I only wish you'd followed my advice the first day you came here, and taken that road out of town. Sorry I had to hit you, Doc. We better clean up those cuts. SiSidown. I'm glad you used your head. What do you think I should do? I don't know. #You could leave the country, I guess. That wouldn't exonerate you. Besides, I'm'mired. I don't want to run away. I'd rather stay and fafa whatever I have to. Doc, give me at least until tomorrow night. #Maybe I can help you. How? #Well, I could... see McHugh at the mine. He's the only one you ever robbed. He might listen to reason. #You'd be wasting your time. I know McHugug You'll find no mercy there. I don't know. I'm a pretty good horse trader. Maybe I could find something to swap. Why are you doing all this for me, Bill? I like the way you like horses. Say thatat aga. I said I could turn the Monk over to you personally. In return for what? Depends how bad you want him. Several things, maybe. #One, since he never robbed anyone else, a word from you could get him a light sentence when it comes to trial. Show the Monk leleniency after all the trouble he's caused? When we nail the Monk, he gets all that's coming to him. He's never killed, never shot anyone. Only because the drivers were thinking of their own skins. You don't know the man like I do. Like maybe you know your own self, eh, Foss? If I were the Monk, would I be here? #The guard shot him, remember? If you're not interested in the man, I might as well go. #Sure I'm interested. I just don't like making deals with thieves. #What's the price? Price? Your company owns Squatters Flats. You know as well as I do that a dam and an irrigation system would help. That's all settled. #Dr. Henderson is matching my half of the investment. #No, he's not. The doc made some bad investments. His outside income has been cut off. So... What's this got to do with the Monk? If you'll put up all the money for that dam now, I'll turn ththe Monk over today. What if you can't? I will. #All right, Foss, but I warn you. You fail to come through anand we'll have enough on u to lock you up instead. The way the town's stirred up, he can't show himself in Silverado. But if you'll get a marshal, I'll meet you in Calistoga with the Monk by sundown. I'll be there. e. Just bringn the Monk, dead or alive. By the way, McHugh, the Monk wants all this in writing, just in case of a nasty accident. Ah, if the Monk's hiding out in these e hills, he must have turned into a mole. Who's that? Ain't none of our bunch. #Hello! Hey, you! Hello! I guess we lost him, men. Did Bill Foss say where he was going? #He's got a horse that was hurt... All I know is he said he was taking him for a short ride in order to loosen up his leg. Put a lock on the corral as soon as we leave and another one on the stable. Outside of Zeke's stage hitch, I don't want another horse leaving Silverado today. y. Yes, Sheriff. And if Foss shows up, see that he sticks around till I get back. Use your gun if you have to. You're a deputy. #Okay, Sheriff. Come on, boys. Hello, Bill. #Know the sheriff's been looking for you? He's not the only one. Where's Doc? I don't know. He left here about an hour ago. What? #He asked me to give you this. Anything wrong? #Doc won't be back. He left the Monk's confession. Doc... Doc is the Monk? Why, it's incredible. #The best friend I ever had. "What lies within the heart of a man is sometimes hard to understand." Whoa. Whoa. #Bill, Doc may be in danger. Why? Zeke's been spreading word around that his stage for Calistoga is carrying gold today. Did Doc know that? Oh, he must have. #Hyah! If that's where he's gone, they'll kill him without giving him a chance to talk, without knowing who he is. #What are you going to do? I've got to stop him. They'll stop you first, lad. #The posse wiwi be watching Zeke's coach. They think I'm on horseback. If I could get my coach on the road ahead of Zeke's... I'll get Big Fella. #Meet me in the livery stable right away. I'm a- tellin' you, the sheriff said no horse nor you either are leaving here today. You're breakin' the law! The law's been broken. I was on your side once, but now I'm... #All right, Sam, get going. But... Go on, get goin'. #Oh, shucks. I'll take care of your gun for you. u. Bill, if they recognize you, they'll shoot you. That's'sy coach. Unhitch those horses. #When we get back. I suppose you think you're going out to try to save your friend the Monk. Our friend the Monk, Jeannie. #The Monk is Doc Henderson. I don't believe you. Say, you can be of help to us here. What...? Let me out of here. Bill Foss, what are you doing? Spread out, boys! Quiet. Read that. Bill, Doc. I can't believe it. #Zeke's trap! We can save Doc if we can reach him before the others. Seeing you here, the posse won't stop us. #We've got to reach him first, Bill. Faster, boys, faster! #Stretch, Big Fella, stretch 'em out! Come on, boy, come on! What in thunder? Hey, it's Jeannie and Foss! #Come on! They're gonna pass. #Hyah, boys! Stretch! Yeah, they're gonna pass! Hey, let's go there! Hyah! Hyah! #Hyah! That's goin', Big Fella. #Come on, Oregon! Come on, Utah! That's the wrong stage, men. Doc. #I wasn't expectiti you, Bill. They've set a trap for you. Come on. No. Drive on, so you won't get caught in it. Get in, Doc, please! You have my confession. It clears you. #I change my mind. I'm not giving up. I had to take this last chance, Bill, to get that money for the dam. The squatters will have their dam, paid for by McHugh, if you'll surrender to him in Calistoga by sundown. #I've got it in writing. You have? In writing? #Come on. All right, Bill. #Hurry, Doc! Stay where you are! Well, boys, looks like we done it up all brown and tasty. Come on, stick 'em high, all of you. #You up there, get down. I told you my plan woululwork. #We got the Monk this time, all right. Zeke, listen. #How could you, of all people, let him finagle you into riding out so he could join up and save the Monk? Foss, you ain't got the doc around this time to talk you out of trouble. Now let's see what the mighty Monk looks like. Drop your gun, Zeke. #Also the rest of you. Doc. #Yeah, Doc. Back up, all of you. Get in the coach, Jeannie. You still have that message I left, Bill? #Yeah. Give it to Zeke. Then get your horses moving. We gotta k kp that appointment in Calistoga. Oh, Doc. #It's all right, Jeannie. It's better thth way, out in the air. Those jails are confining, unhealthy. I don't think McHugh will care what condition I'm in, just so I get there. My friends will get their water. Better tell Big Fella to stretch those legs out, Bill. We don't want to be late. I can't believe it. Doc was one of the finest memeI ever knew. Happy days! Good luck, Jeannie! Happy days! Good luck to you, Jeannie! Say hello to San Francncco. May the gods bless you with boys! If you have any trouble with that big baboon, let me know! Ahh! #Just a minutut Foss. I want to see you. What about? I got something for you. This. What's this? $437. Wedding present. And I got another 100 sasa my hitch can outrun that string of misfits of yours any day. I'll race you now from here to the crossroads for it. Mister, I just got married, and me and my horses have sproutetewings. #You got yourself a bet. All right, thehe you are. #You hold the stakes. Tim, give us a starting signal. #With exceeding pleasure. Are you ready? Let 'er go, Tim. Hyah! #Come on, get going! I bet Mr. Stevenson a pound of something on this. Hey! You got the brake on. #You got the brake on! So I have. Now, how did I come to forget a thing like that? I can't seem totoet it loose here. #I'll help you. Come on. I must be getting plumb feeble- minded to do a thing like that. Now, you quit your plaguin' me, Zeke. I found my story in Silverado. I saw its beginning, and I saw its growth. As all men must, he paid the penalty for his crime. But we cannot condemn him too harshly, for above all laws he held the welfare of his fellow man.
