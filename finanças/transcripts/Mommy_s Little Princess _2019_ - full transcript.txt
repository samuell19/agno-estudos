- Mom, we're out of cereal. - "Mom, we're out of cereal." What am I supposed to do, Lizzy? You know, you act like you're some little princess that I'm supposed to wait on hand and foot. Newsflash: you're not special. So get your ass up and go to the market. - Well, I need money. - You need money? Right. The sun rises and sets for money, doesn't it? Well, I don't have any damn money! What? You think you're special? You're nobody. - This is Unit 514. Code 3 affirmative. - You'll always be a nobody. - Female, 25 to 35 years old, possible overdose. - Patient is nonresponsive. [gasping] - Twenty, thirty, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven. - Stealing from your mom? - No. - Sure looks like it, thief. - I'm not a thief. Why are you even here? Go home. - Maybe you should go home. Oh, that's right, you can't. - This is my home, Allie. Go back to yours. - What is going on? Allie? - Lizzy was taking money out of your purse. - No, I wasn't! She's lying! - Then why is her purse unzipped? - I was just making sure it was still there. - Well, it's fine now. - Look, I'm not worried about the wallet. Allie, what are you doing here? Is everything OK with your mom? - No. I can't deal with her anymore. She's literally the craziest person in Philadelphia. A complete bitch. - Like you? - Lizzy! That's enough. Come on. Let's get back to bed. Greg and I need to talk to Allie. - Don't use that kind of language in front of Lizzy. And don't call your mother names. - You called her a lot worse when you were going through the divorce. - I was angry at the time. - Well, I'm angry now. - OK, so, Allie, are you staying here tonight? - Is that a problem? - No. No, of course not. I just... I didn't know that you were here. - She texted me around midnight. I told her to come on over. I didn't want to wake you. - Mom is seriously out of her mind. I can't live with her anymore. - Let's talk about this tomorrow when we all have a little more energy. - Yeah, OK. Goodnight, Allie. - Hey, Dad? - Yep. - Lizzy really was stealing cash out of Julianna's purse. Just FYI. - I know it looks like that, but she wasn't. She has these nightmares about her biological mother. They didn't have money. It makes her feel better to know that Jules has some in her purse. - Huh? - She never steals any of it. - That's bizarre. - Lizzy's been through a lot. Just go to bed, sweetie, please. And don't worry about what Lizzy does. - Oh, honey... Come here. Did you have another nightmare? Is that why you were downstairs checking the money? - I didn't take any, I swear. - I know you didn't. - Why does Allie hate me so much? - Oh... Allie doesn't hate you. She's just got problems of her own and she tends to take them out on everybody else. - She's not really going to live with us full time, is she? - Well, I can't really see her mother agreeing to that, but... Look, while she's here, I want you to be nice to her, OK? I don't like seeing you two at each other's throats. - I love you, Mom. - I love you too. Come on, let's get some sleep. [dog barking, birds chirping] - Good morning. - Hey, morning. - I have some great news. There was an email from Laura this morning. A lady in Baltimore wants to commission me to do a painting. - Apparently, she saw one of my pieces at the art show in New York and wants something similar. - Greg, that's fantastic! Oh, I'm so happy for you! - Unbelievable. [sighing happily] Maybe, maybe this dry spell is finally over. I was starting to think I might have to take that job with my brother. - You at a desk job? You wouldn't last a week. - Mm-mm. - Well, now you don't even have to consider it. Told you that art show was gonna pay off. - You were right. - Will you buy me Guitar Band? Last time I asked, you said you didn't have any extra money. - Al, we talked about this. It'll wait till your birthday. Hey, how about "Congratulations, Dad, that's great"? - Finish up, Lizzy. It's time for camp. [bell ringing] - Cody said he heard you were adopted. Is that true? - Three months ago. - Where d'you live before that? - In a foster home for two years. Before that, I lived with my real mom. - Did your real mom die or something? - Yeah. - What happened to her? - My, uh... my real mom was really rich and we had our own airplane. One night in a storm, the plane crashed. She died and they never found her body. - That's so sad. - A lot of people wanted to adopt me, but I couldn't find one I liked, so I tried to live in a foster home. Finally, I found my new mom. - So... do you like your real mom better, or your new mom? - My new mom. She's perfect. - Did you know my mom's from Trinidad? She moved here to Philadelphia when she was 3. We're going there in October. My dad's from California, but his grandfather was from Serbia. Where are your parents from? - Hey, Mom? Where are you from? - Chicago. I moved here about ten years ago, when I took the job at the firm I'm at now. Why? - My friend Finley, her mom is from Trinidad and her dad's family lived in Serbia. She asked where we were from, but I didn't know what to say. - Lizzy, did your mom ever tell you anything about your dad? - She... She didn't know who he was. - I thought Iworked late. - Not working. I wanted to get those genetic tests, you know, "My Genes and Me"? Where they find your genealogy, medical history... The pharmacy next to my office carries them. - Everybody in our neighbourhood is doing those tests. - Yeah, everyone's doing it. Just... I don't know. Lizzy doesn't even know who her biological father is. I thought maybe this could help me answer what her mother couldn't. - Well, don't mention it in front of Allie. She'll just add it to her list of reasons why the world is unfair. [chuckling] [dramatic music] - Mmm! Smells good. Hey. So, what's the verdict? - She's staying with us for the summer. Now, Allie promised not to go back and forth, and back to Heather's when school starts. I think we can make this work for everyone. I really do. - OK. What'd you make? - Chicken. - Hey, Lizzy! I have a surprise for you. - What is it? Is it one of those tests they show on TV where you can find out stuff about yourself? - I thought it'd be fun if we did it together. You know, learn about our genetics. That way, when your friends ask you where your parents are from, you'll know. - That's so cool! Thanks, Mom. What do we have to do? - OK, it says here that we take the swab and put the saliva in the tube and... then we just put the label on and send it. I will pay for it to be rushed, so we'll get it back next week. [dramatic music] - Can't believe the whole week has already gone by. I think it's progressing really well. - So, I am gonna go take Lizzy shopping with me and then to her first swim lesson. I invited Allie, but she's going to the lake with friends. - Ah. [phone chiming] - Oh! Hey, Lizzy! The results to our genetic tests are in! So, no predispositions to any serious illnesses-- which just means that you're not at a higher risk for things like cancer or diabetes. - That's good, right? - Mm-hmm, yeah. It's very good. And... on to your ancestry... - What? What's it say? - It says that you are a little French, a little Italian, and you are 65% German. And... your maternal great- great-grandmother was... No, wait. Really? - She was what? - It says that your maternal great-great-grandmother was... a Wittelsbaum? - What's a Will... Willsbaum? - Wittelsbaum. It's the last name to a German dynasty of, uh, nobles. You're a descendant of German nobility. - Nobility? What's that? Tell me! Is it good? - Yeah, it's good. Uh, nobles are kind of like a royal family. And it's said here they controlled territories in Bavaria up until about 150 years ago. This is amazing! Who would've guessed? - Does that mean I'm a royal princess? - It means that you have some royal blood, but we have to study the lineage. - What's lineage mean? - It's like the line to the throne. - The throne? That's amazing! What's yours say? Are you a princess too? - Well, let's see. Ah, nope. No royal blood for me. But I am... part British, Irish and Spanish heritage. Oh, and look at that! I am 2% East Asian. Well, I can see why everyone at work is doing these things. Pretty interesting, huh? - You're nobody! You think you're special? You're not special. - I'm not a nobody. Not anymore. I'm a princess. A real live princess. - Hey, Lizzy! You ready? - Yeah, Mom. Let's go. What are you looking for? - Just some books for the summer. You can get one too, if you want. [whimsical music] - Mom, how do you spell Wittelsbaum? I wanna look it up in my new book. - Uh, W-i-t-t... e-l-s-b-a-u-m. - Oh my God! It's in here! It's in this book! A whole page! And there's a castle! - Really? Read it to me. - "The House of Wittelsbaum is a royal family "which reigned as princes and princesses, dukes and duchesses, "through patri... patrilineal descent." What is that? - It just means passed down from father to son. - Oh. "Several members also had non-reigning titles including baron and baroness, count and countess." [whimsical music] - Hey, your mom says it's time for... Whoa. What the hell is this? - Get out of my room. - Is this in Dutch? - German. It's all related to my family. Now get lost. - Your family? - Get out. - Don't cop an attitude. Trying to take an interest, here. How does this have anything to do with your family? - Well, we got the results from the "Me and My Genes" tests back and I found out I'm a princess. [laughing] - What? What are you talking about? - My maternal great-great- grandmother was part of the Wittelsbaum family. That's a noble family that ruled in Bavaria. That's in Europe. - I know where Bavaria is. And just because you have ancestors that are from some noble family doesn't make you a princess. - Ask my mom. - Listen to me, OK, because I'm trying to help you right now. If you tell people you're a princess, you're just going to embarrass yourself. - It's true, though. You don't know what you're talking about! Now get out! - Gladly, Your Highness. - Hey. Oh, Lizzy, what is all this? - They're pictures of my family. This is my room and I'm not going to take them down. - I never said you had to take this down. - I finally have a family. - Hey... come here. There's nothing wrong with this, OK? But we're your family. Me, Greg and Allie. - Greg isn't. You're not even married to him. - Well, we plan on getting married someday. - I don't want you to marry him. If he's here, then Allie's here, and I can't stand her! She said I shouldn't tell people I'm a princess. - Well, we don't know that you're a princess, sweetie. You probably shouldn't tell anyone until you know for sure. - Then how can I find out? I wanna know. - A 1% chance she's even got some sort of title? She's bound to be disappointed. - Well, until I find out, she's just gonna believe it. - When Allie was little, she had an entire wall in her room devoted to Hannah Montana. That's how they are at that age. Very singularly focused. - Yeah, I suppose. I'm just worried about Lizzy, you know? I mean, she already has a hard time relating to other kids, and... this princess thing, it's just... it's a target on her, you know? I'm worried she's gonna get bullied. - Lizzy can hold her own. [chuckling] And trust me, she'll let go of all this princess stuff eventually. Do what you want. If you really think that getting a genealogist is a good idea, to check on her status, go for it. I just think that sometimes, some things are better left unknown. [dramatic music] - So you really are a princess? - Yep. From Germany. - That's so cool. - Lizzy... Wattels... - Wittelsbaum. - That's not your last name. - It will be when my mom marries Daniel Wittelsbaum. He's the baron in Germany that's related to me. - So you want your mom to marry someone in Germany? - Yep. That way, she can be royalty too and we can go live in a castle. - I thought your mom was already married. - Greg just lives with us, and so does his stupid daughter now. I just have to find a way for her to meet Daniel. - You should email him. - He's royalty, duh! It's not like he's just going to email back. - Oh, I know what you should do! Go to Germany and find out where he eats lunch and then accidentally bump into him at the restaurant. I saw that in a movie once. - Can I have everyone's attention, please? If any of you are interested in our overnight arts camp next week, I have brochures. Take 'em home to your parents. It's one full week at the Steadman House. We'll have painting, drawing, sculpting, music, and of course, theatre. As always, we'll be putting on a play at the Sherwood Playhouse near the camp on Saturday. This summer, it's Cinderella. Yes, Lizzy? - How do I go to overnight camp? - The fees are listed in the brochures and your parents can sign you up online. But know that we can only accommodate 14 kids out of everyone who belongs to this community centre, so the spots are very limited. Yes? - Ms. Mila, is a TV crew going to be there to film the play again? - Yes, they will. - Ms. Mila, I wanna play Cinderella! - At the camp, we'll have auditions and that's how we'll assign the parts. - But you don't understand. I'm a real live princess. [all laughing] No, really, I am! [all laughing] I have proof! - Like I said, we'll hold auditions on the second day of camp. Now everyone follow me to the bus, please. - If people know what's good for them, they'll stop ignoring me. - OK, thanks, guys. We'll come back to this next week. So, Bethany, you were saying that you think I should find someone who has access to German family records? - Yes. My uncle Donald is really into that stuff. He's not a professional genealogist or anything, but I'm sure he'd love to do it. - Really? - I can ask. I mean, he researched our family back 26 generations. - Oh, please. And I will pay him. I just... I need someone to do it sooner than later. - Sure. I'll give him a call today. - You're amazing. Thank you. - Mom, look! - Overnight camp? - One week. And we're going to put on Cinderellaand they're going to show it on TV! - Oh, honey... You do realise that you have to sleep there? What happens if you have a nightmare? I won't be there to talk to you. - That's OK. My friend Finley is going too. If I have a nightmare, I'll just call you. I really, really, really wanna go. - Are you sure you're ready? OK. We'll try it. - Thank you, Mommy! - This one's from the bridal store. - My stuff is here! - What is all this? - You tell me. It's been arriving all day. - The castle! - Holy crap. - Lizzy, did you order all this stuff online? - How did you pay for it? - With Mom's credit card. Greg, can you help me put this together? Pretty please? - Lizzy, you can't just take my credit card and buy anything you want. - But it's all my princess stuff. I need it. How else are people going to know I'm royalty? - Honey, listen to me closely. You can't buy whatever you want with someone else's money. - I didn't use your money, I used your credit card. And I put it back when I was done. - It's the same thing. A credit card is like a promise to pay it back. Honey, I know that you're excited about being a part of a royal family, but... you may not be a princess. - Then what am I? A duchess? - You're nothing. - I'm not nothing! I'M SPECIAL!! WHY DON'T YOU GO LIVE WITH YOUR MOM AND LEAVE US ALONE?? - Lizzy! - I didn't mean it like that. I just meant that she doesn't have some royal title, is all. [sighing] - Why are you so bent on antagonising her? - Me? What about her? She steals Julianna's credit card and buys $1,000 worth of stuff and it's "Oh no, poor Lizzy!" Poor Lizzy gets everything she wants. She wants a genetics test and she gets it. But what do I get? If I want something, it's "No, Allie, wait until your birthday". The problem is Mommy's little princess, it sure as hell isn't me. - I'll talk to her. Even if Allie's jealous, she has no right to antagonise Lizzy. - Maybe it was a mistake to do the genetic tests. - No, no. You did the right thing. It's an exciting thing for her. Would be for any ten-year-old girl. - Yeah, it's just... all this... because she's so desperate to feel important just breaks my heart. Can I come in? - I'm sorry for using your credit card without asking. - Please don't ever do that again. - I won't. - That's not actually why I came up here, though. Look, I wanna talk to you about what you said to Allie. You said you were special. - I am, right? Because I'm related to a royal family? - Oh, honey, you... you were special long before we took those tests. As a matter of fact, you are so special that... I could've adopted any child in the country and I picked you. - My mom always said I was a nobody. - Your mom was wrong. You're an amazing person, OK? It doesn't matter who you're related to, honey, you... you are special and terrific because you're you. And I love you more than anything in the world. - I love you, Mom. Can I keep the stuff I bought, though? [laughing] - You mean the stuff I bought? Just this time. - Here. It's $32. - No, honey, you keep your money and you spend it on something you really, really want. - OK, Mom. - OK. [sighing] Why don't you come down and get something to eat? I'm sure Greg has dinner ready. - I know what I want. I want you to marry my mom and we can all live together in your castle. [glitzy music] - ♪ So dangerous inside When it all goes down ♪ ♪ All I really want is just to be another girl ♪ ♪ Pretending to be nice So dangerous inside ♪ ♪ And I won't stop - The problem is, she's not a regular kid. Growing up, she had no boundaries, no discipline. In fact, she's more mature because she basically raised herself. - Yeah, and then there's Allie. - Ugh, Allie... Aside from the divorce, she had a normal childhood, and she is just this giant ball of teenage angst. - I'll let you in on a secret. There's no normal when it comes to parenting. - How do you do it with three kids? - Being a member of a few wine clubs helps. - Bethany! - I'm just kidding. But you're right, they're all different. - What if I'm doing it wrong? My fear is that... Lizzy's life will end up being screwed up and it'll be all my fault. - No. You are doing just fine. And I will bring you a very good bottle of pinot tomorrow. - Thank you. [footsteps approaching] - This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would. I need to get to work on that painting. Thanks. - Isn't this a bit young for her? She's ten. - Well, Lizzy never had a single toy since she was put in foster care at eight, so... I guess she still likes things other kids her age are growing out of. - I can't believe she's letting her keep all this stuff. If I had done that, you would've made me send it back. - Can I ask you a question? Why are you so angry all the time? - I'm not. - Yeah, you are. Honey, the world is not against you. I am not against you. So why d'you go into any conversation swinging a sword? - If I tell you I don't like something, it's not gonna change. You're just gonna say: "Sorry, Allie, but you'll have to deal with that" just like you always have. - Like I always have? - Yeah. - Sorry, Lizzy, the camp's been overbooked. Unfortunately, there's no spot for you. - You mean I can't go? - Well, I can create a wait list so if someone cancels, you can have their spot. - No. I don't wanna be on any wait list. I'm going to that camp! - Lizzy, I understand you're disappointed, but I don't like the way you're speaking to me right now. - I can talk to you any way I want. Don't you know what I am? - Lizzy, there are rules. They apply to everyone including you. This discussion is over. Everybody line up to go to the pool, please. - Ms. Mila? Can I use the bathroom first? - You can go when we get down to the locker room. - I don't think I can wait that long. Seriously, I need to go. Now. - Fine. Go now and meet us down there. [dramatic music] - Now onto stupid Bronwyn. Penicillin. "Penicillin and its derivatives "belong to an antibiotic group called beta-lactam. "Available by prescription only, it includes the following drugs." Right there. Sorry, Bronwyn. I guess you're not going to arts camp. [crickets chirping] I love it! This colour is my favourite, too. Pink! - Daniel Wittelsbaum has asked me to marry him. I'll soon be a queen! Oh, there's so much to do! I have to plan a wedding-- and we have to move into the castle, of course! Oh, Lizzy, isn't it exciting? - This is exactly what I wanted. - Who needs to use the bathroom? - I do. - Sure, Bronwyn. Be quick, please. - I need to go too. [dramatic music] Oh, hi, Bronwyn! I likeour shirt. - Thanks! - This is the best fruit punch ever. Wanna try it? - No, thanks. - Are you too good or something? - No, I just have my own fruit punch in my backpack, is all. Well, see ya. - I'm a princess. People need to start doing what I tell them to do. Let's sit with Bronwyn today. - I thought you didn't like Bronwyn. Oh, I brought this for you. - What is it? - That castle you like is going to be open to the public. - What? - Yeah. They open the castle one week out of the year for a garden party. People bring picnic baskets and sit out on the lawn. It's kinda cool. It's happening in two weeks. Oh, and you could even meet members of the royal family. - How did you find this? - My mom gets these emails all the time from a travel company. They always talk about the things you can do in Europe. - You're the most amazing friend in the world. I absolutely, 100% have to go to this. - Can I go with you? - Maybe. I'll ask my mom. Um, can you do me a favour? Go get me a tissue from Ms. Mila. She keeps them in her bag. - Sure. [coughing] Um... Ms. Mila? Something's wrong with Bronwyn. - Bronwyn, are you OK, sweetie? Are you choking? I think it's an allergic reaction. - I'll call 911. [choking] - Don't worry, she'll be OK. Here you are. Thank you for coming to our garden party. Yes, we only hold it once a year so people can see how beautiful it is inside. - Sorry I'm late. - Oh... that's for you. - Aww, thank you, honey. I needed someone to give me a flower today. How was day camp? - Great. Guess what? - What? - The Wittelsbaum family castle will be open to the public. They're having a huge party and we can actually meet my relatives. Can we go? - This is in two weeks. - Yeah. Finley found out about it. Can we go? - It's kind of short notice for work. - Please. If we miss it, we have to wait a whole year before it happens again. - I'll think about it, OK? - Alright. - Come on, let's go. - I think it's a great idea. A family trip is exactly what we need. - I'm still waiting to hear back from Bethany's uncle about Lizzy's... title. - What difference does it make? Even if she's not related to that family at all, it would still be fun. Too bad it wasn't during Oktoberfest. [laughing] - You really think we should go? - I do. The timing's perfect. I'm done with the painting, and besides, doing something fun and relaxing with the girls might show them that they have more in common than they realise. - That's true. Alright, I'll book the tickets. - We're going to Europe? That's awesome. - So, I was looking at travel reviews online last night and everyone says the garden party is so much fun. Lizzy! What's the matter, honey? Aren't you excited? - Yeah, of course. - You don't seem all that happy. - I am. I really am. I better get ready for day camp. - You don't seem that happy that we're going to Germany. - I'm super happy. I just... didn't know that Allie was going to go with us. - Oh, I see. Well, Greg and I thought it would be more fun to go as a family. And besides, if Allie sees the castle, maybe she'll understand where your ancestors come from better. - I guess. - It's gonna be fine. We're gonna have a fantastic time. [dramatic music] - I want to give you all an update on Bronwyn's condition. I spoke to her mother last night and she was released from the ER around 9PM and she's going to be OK. - Do they know what caused that to happen to her? - It was some sort of allergic reaction, but they aren't sure what she ate or came in contact with just yet. - Is she coming back to camp? - No, I don't believe so. - How about overnight camp? - No, she won't be. Why do you ask? - Just wondering. Maybe we can all draw pictures of flowers and send them to her. - That's a pretty cool idea. - Sure, we can do that. Right after we finish our volcanoes. Right now, I need everyone to measure one cup of vinegar. Be sure to not spill it on the outside of your volcano, because it will ruin the paint. - Ms. Mila, does vinegar always ruin paint? - Pretty much, because vinegar is very acidic. Also, let's try to not get it on our shirts, please. Thank you. Lizzy, what are you doing? We're not painting right now. - Sorry. - Since Bronwyn won't be coming to arts camp, you're next on the waiting list... so I guess you're going. - OK. - OK. I'll call your mother to let her know. - I'm going to paint Bronwyn a sunflower. - OK. - So, it's finally ready to go? - Yep. I just hope the client likes it. - Oh, how could she not? She hired the best painter on the East Coast. - Oh, the courier will be here between 8 and 10 tomorrow, so I won't be able to drop Lizzy off at the overnight camp. - That's OK. Where's Allie? - At the mall, getting her dress for the garden party. She's really into it. - You guys are all coming to the play on Saturday, right? Don't forget, the TV station is going to be filming. - Don't worry, sweetie, we'll be there. - OK, I'm gonna go get dinner started. Lizzy, why don't you go to your room and lay out your clothes you want for camp, OK? - Sorry, Greg. Looks like you'll be too busy to come to Germany with us. [dramatic music] n, Lizzy, let's go!We're gonna be late! - I'm so excited for camp! - Come on, get in! Well, here we are! - This is where I'm staying? - You know, this place used to belong to a famous artist who lived here 100 years ago. His family donated it. - Hi, Drew. - Hey, Lizzy. Uh... you're in room number 4. - Great. - You can sign her in here. - Oh! Thank you. - Enjoy camp. - Thanks. - Let me take that. - Hi! - Finley! - Wow, you guys, this place is amazing! You two are gonna have the best week. - I can't wait! - Me neither! - I can do this by myself, Mom. - Oh, uh... Are you sure you don't want me to stay a little while until you get settled? - No, I'm good. - OK, well, I am just a phone call away if you need me. - OK. - I love you. Bye, Finley. - Finley, guess what? I brought two of these shirts so we can be twins. - Thanks! [girls giggling] - Hey, Dad. - Hey. - What do you think? For the garden party. - I like it. - And it didn't cost $200 like the dress Lizzy bought. [sighing] - Come sit for a second. I wanna talk to you about Lizzy. - Oh God, please no! - Come on. Come on, sit. When I met Julianna, she told me about how much she wanted to have kids but couldn't have any. But at some point, she wanted to adopt. - OK? - When the agency called about Lizzy, they said they had a ten-year-old girl who'd been severely neglected. Had a mother that OD'd. All she wanted was to adopt and help that little girl who had lived so much of her life with absolutely nothing. It's hard for any of us to understand what that's like, to grow up that way, to see your mother die right in front of you. She could really use a big sister. It's not easy for any of us. Julianna's doing her best. So am I. All I'm asking is that you put in some effort. Your mom and I made a lot of mistakes. Neither one of us handled the divorce well, and you were definitely caught in the middle of it. I'm sorry about that. I want us to be a family, a strange sort of stitched- together family, but one that functions. I want us all to care about each other and... be civil to each other. A year from now, you... you're off to college. There won't be a lot of time to build that. Will you work with me? - Yes. I'll do my best with Lizzy. - Thank you. - I didn't know that, about Lizzy seeing her mom OD. - I think there's still a lot we don't know about what she went through. I try to remember that when she's walking around the house in her tiara. [chuckling] - I love you, Dad. - I love you too, sweetheart. - Lizzy's first ten years may have sucked, but... she's really lucky to have you and Julianna adopt her. - Thank you. [giggling] [dramatic music] - Girls, did you read the sign? It says you're not allowed to go past it. - We just wanted to pick some flowers. - It doesn't matter. Rules are rules. From now on, you stay where Drew and I can see you. It's dangerous out there. There's coyotes and poison ivy and all kinds of things. - I had poison ivy once. It was horrible. All I could do was lay in bed super still 'cause it hurt too much to move. - Exactly. That's why we're not allowed to go past the sign. - We're sorry, Ms. Mila. - OK. Go get cleaned up and come down in ten minutes. We're gonna talk about auditions for the play. - I really think that I got through to Allie. - That's great. - Yeah. [phone ringing] Who's this? It's the lady that bought the painting. This is Greg. - [Hi, it's Ellen.] [I got the painting, but there's a streak on it.] - What? - [Two inches wide down the front. It reeks like vinegar.] - Vinegar? - [And the bubble wrap's been cut.] - Are you sure? - [Yeah. It's a mess.] - That's impossible. I packaged it myself. - [Well, I hope so.] - All I can say is that I'm sorry. - [OK.] - I can drive out there tomorrow afternoon and pick it up. Whatever it is, I'm sure it can be fixed. - [OK, if you say so.] - Yeah. - [Thanks.] - Thank you. - What happened? - She says it looks like someone poured vinegar under the box. She could smell it when she opened it. - Well, is it ruined? - It's one long streak down the front, so it doesn't sound like it, but... I need to see it. - How did that happen? - So you can audition for any part that you want, but keep in mind Ms. Mila might give you a different part, OK? Everyone will get to play something, and every part's important. - Mr. Drew, I was Cinderella in my school play last year, so I already know the lines. - That's awesome, Madison. So, everyone try and memorise as much as you can tonight, but don't worry, you don't have to be off-script or anything. In the meantime, if you want to come and see the horses, we're gonna go to the barn in about five minutes, OK? - So there's no way it could've happened during shipping? - No. And definitely vinegar. - You don't think one of the girls did it, do you? - Allie and I are sort of on good terms again, so I can't imagine it'd be her, and there's no reason for Lizzy to do it. - Well, how bad is it? - [Not as bad] as I originally thought. I should be able to fix it in just a couple days. - Good. Hey, babe, I gotta go. Someone's at the door. - I'll see you at home. - Hey, come in. - Sorry for interrupting. I spoke to my uncle at lunch. He said he's working on it. Progress is slow. - Thanks for the update. - No problem. - How can I go to the ball when I have no dress? I can't possibly wear these rags. How can I go to the ball, how can I go to the ball? - I hope you're not trying out for the role of Cinderella. - Actually, I am. - Well, I'm a real princess and I can have whatever I want, so you need to pick a different role. - I guess we'll see who Ms. Mila thinks is better. - If you try out for Cinderella, even if you don't make it, I'll hurt you. - Lizzy, why are you being so mean? - You're a psycho! - No, I'm royalty. Don't you forget it. - Get away from me before I call Ms. Mila! - Too bad there's no wicked witch, you'd be perfect. - That girl, your friend-- she's weird. - So, everything's going well? No nightmares last night? - Nope! I'm having a great time. We're auditioning tomorrow for the play. [How are Greg and Allie?] - They're good. Allie bought the cutest dress for the trip. - Did that lady like Greg's painting? - [Well, actually, something happened to it during shipping.] [Greg has to fix it now, but it should only take a couple of days.] - So Greg and Allie are still going to Germany with us? - [Yeah, of course, honey.] Everything's confirmed. Don't worry. Listen, Lizzy, I really have to go, but you can call me later if you want, OK? - Yeah. OK. Bye. - [Bye, baby.] - No! They can't come with us. They're going to ruin the whole thing. Do something! If you want to marry my mom, we have to make sure Greg and Allie don't go. - I had poison ivy once. It was horrible. All I could do was lay in bed super still 'cause it hurt too much to move. - And then she said she'd hurt me if I tried out. - She actually said that? That she'd hurt you? Alright. Thank you for letting me know. Why don't you head outside with the others? - OK. - "Poison ivy has three leaves, "which is why children are often taught the rhyme 'Leaves of three, let them be.'" [door opening] Finley? Remember when you got poison ivy? - Yeah? - How long did it last? - It was like... two weeks, I think. - Does it leave permanent damage like scars or anything? - No, but I had to take baths in oatmeal and put ice packs all over me until it went away. Why? Did you go out there after Ms. Mila told us not to? - No. Just wondering. - OK. [dramatic music] - Perfect. - Lizzy? What the... - Leaves of three. Sorry, Allie, you're not gonna feel like going to Germany when you have poison ivy. I'm sure your dad will stay back to take care of you. - Lizzy? What are you doing? I told you this area is off-limits. - I-- I was just-- - No, that's it. You've broken too many rules now. You're going home. - No, you can't send me home. - Lizzy, just threatening Madison was enough to expel you. Let's go. I'm calling your mother. - Please don't. I'm sorry. I'll be good, I promise. - It's too late. Back to the house, now. - I'm not going. - And I'm not leaving you out here by yourself. Fine. I'm calling your mother from right here. - I have to be on TV. That way, everybody will know I'm a princess. - Lizzy! Lizzy, what are you doing? Lizzy! Lizzy, stop! Lizzy! Lizzy-- - No! Give me that! - Lizzy! Lizzy, stop! No! [screaming] [dramatic music] - Are you gonna use the same courier? - No. No, this time around, I'm gonna deliver it myself. - You can't go to the ball, Cinderella. - Yes, I can! - No, you can't. - But I must! - Um... Oh, uh... No, you don't belong at the ball. Where were you? - In the pottery room. Are you still wasting your time practicing for the role of Cinderella? - Come on, Finley, let's just go somewhere else. - That's a good idea. - Hey, girls. Have any of you seen Ms. Mila around? - No. - Me neither. - Lizzy? - I haven't seen her. Have you tried calling her cell phone? - She's not answering. - Maybe she's just busy. - Do you want us to help you look for her? - No, Madison. Thank you though. If any of you see her, let her know I'm looking for her, OK? - OK. - OK. - Sure. - Come on, Finley. - Hey, look what I got for Lizzy for the trip. Whoa, what happened to the painting? - Was like this when it arrived. - Are you kidding me? How? - That's the question of the week. - I'm sorry. - Wait a minute. You bought something for Lizzy? - They were on sale, but yeah. Don't expect it to happen every time I go shopping. - I wouldn't dare. - It's just strange, you know? She wouldn't just leave. Her car's still parked here. Her purse is still in her bedroom. I just... don't know where she could be. - You're in trouble. - Trouble over what? - I know what you did. - What did I do? - You know what you did. You stole Ms. Mila's flashlight. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did, and I have proof. You're never gonna find it. And I'm gonna tell on you. - Go ahead. Tell them you stole it. - You're such a liar. - Drew! Finley stole Ms. Mila's flashlight. - What? - I didn't steal it, I found it in her bed. - One of you has Mila's flashlight? Where is it? Where did you find it? - She had it. - That's a lie. You brought it in this afternoon and said you found it by the pond. - Which trail? - I have no idea what she's even talking about. - You said you found it out by where we were playing the first day. She said Ms. Mila must have dropped it, and then she said "finders keepers, losers weepers". - I did not. - Yes, you did. - I don't care who found it, OK? Ms. Mila is missing. - You still haven't found her yet? - Just tell me exactly where you found this. - It's hard to describe. I can show you. Is this where you found it? - I told you, I didn't find it here. - You're not going to be in trouble. Right, Drew? - She's right. If you just tell me where you found it, you won't be in any trouble. - Over there. - OK, girls, let's go back to camp, OK? Sheriff. - If something bad happened to Ms. Mila, the cops are going to think you did it. - Me? Why? - 'Cause you had the flashlight. - No, you had the... How did you...? How did you... get the flashlight? - You're looking in the wrong place. - Oh, my God! Mila's here! She's down here! - What happened to her? - I don't know. - Maybe she had a horrible accident. - You're so creepy. Get away from us. - Campers, I have some bad news. Ms. Mila has had a terrible fall. She's in a coma right now and... they just took her to the hospital. We have another counselor coming to replace her for the rest of the camp, but she was in charge of putting on the play. We have to cancel it, so there's gonna be no auditions tomorrow morning. - What?! This is a load of crap! - What? - I can't believe you're cancelling the play! That's not fair! Just because of Ms. Mila? - Lizzy, Ms. Mila's in very bad shape right now. She can't put the play on. - Then have someone else do it! Don't just cancel it! I can't believe you'd do this to me! [phone ringing] - Allie, can you get that? - Yeah. Hello? Just a minute. Um, an administrator from Lizzy's camp says you need to come pick up Lizzy first thing in the morning. [dramatic music] - Hello? Hi, sweetie. - They're kicking me out! - I know, honey, I know. Hey... Let's get your stuff and we'll talk about it in the car, OK? - I just don't understand. Why cancel the play? - Maybe they just... felt like they didn't have anyone else who could do it. Plus, I'm sure no one was in the mood after Ms. Mila got hurt so badly. - When my mom died, nothing was cancelled. I went to school the very next day. - Honey, this is different. I know that you're disappointed, but there will be other plays. - But I was going to be on TV. - I know. I know. But, you know, things happen. Hey, Lizzy... Did you really threaten another girl who was trying out to be Cinderella? - I wasn't really going to do anything to her. - On another note, Allie got you a really cute pair of sunglasses for the trip. Wasn't that sweet of her? - Mom, I don't want them to come with us. They're not part of the royal family. - Neither am I! - But you will be, once you meet Daniel Wittelsbaum and he falls in love with you and you guys get married. - What are you talking about? - He's going to be there. This is your one chance to meet him. If Greg and Allie go, it's going to ruin everything. - Honey, I have no interest in marrying into the royal family. I love Greg. [cell phone ringing] Hey, Bethany. You're on speakerphone. I have Lizzy in the car with me. - Hi, sorry to bother you guys. I'm looking for the Louden file. - Oh, I forgot to give it to you, I'm sorry. It's in the inbox on my desk in the green folder. - Great. Thank you. Oh, by the way, my uncle finally got some information back [on the Wittelsbaum family.] - What is it? - If you want, I can tell you when you're back [in the office?] - No! No, I wanna know now! - Uh, it's OK, Bethany. What did he find out? - [Um, Lizzy is indeed] a member of the Wittelsbaum family. But she's too far removed to have a title. - You mean... I'm not a princess? - No, honey. I'm sorry. - What about a duchess or a baroness? - The closest member with a title was your great-great-uncle. [He was a Lord. It didn't extend past him.] - So... I'm nothing? - Thanks, Bethany. Tell your uncle thanks too. - [I will. Bye for now.] - That's not possible! He has to be wrong! - It doesn't make a difference. You're still a member of the family. - I know, but... I just... I wanted to be special. - You are special. Do you hear me? You are special. - But I'm not a princess. - What just happened? - Lizzy just found out from a genealogist that she's not a princess. - Well, I mean, we all kind of suspected that, right? - Lizzy didn't. She's devastated. I'm gonna go talk to her. [breathing heavily] - It's not fair! I never get anything I want! - Lizzy? Sweetie, what are you doing? Oh, honey, don't cry. Hey, hey... shh... it's OK. - No, it's not. I wanted to be a princess so bad. - I know you did, baby. - I wanted to show her that I'm not a loser. I wanted to prove it. [phone ringing] - Baby, you are not a loser. Not at all. - Julianna? Phone. - Allie, can you please take a message? - Um... it's the police. [dramatic music] You OK? - This is Julianna Mathis. I'm sorry, who? Oh, Ms. Mila, her camp counselor. She's awake? Yeah. Yeah, sure, we could come down and do that. What station? OK. We'll be there as soon as we can. - What's going on? - Apparently, Ms. Mila woke up from her coma. The police just want Lizzy and I to go down and talk about what happened before she fell. - I don't know what happened. I don't know anything about it. - That's OK, sweetie. They just want us to go down and give our statements and answer a few questions, is all. - But there's no reason to go if I don't have any information. It's a waste of time. - They're the cops, it's not like you can say no. - Honey, it'll only take a few minutes, OK? And they said that we can go right down here to the station on Vernon Street. - If you don't know the answers, just say you don't know. - Exactly. - We have to go right now? - Today. - Can I, uh... take a shower first? Wash my hair? - Yeah, of course. I'll go get it started. - I've had to talk to the cops before. Just be honest with them and you won't have a problem. They can tell when you're lying. Oh, and... I'm sorry that you're not a princess. But life as a civilian isn't so bad. I should know. - They're wrong. I am a princess. If I can just get to Germany, I can prove it. The police are going to arrest me, and then I won't be able to go. - Where's your dad? - He finished fixing that painting so he's driving it out. - Already? - Yeah, it didn't take him that long to finish it. [dramatic music] - I don't know what they wanna talk to Lizzy about, though. - Probably just to say that they did a real investigation. - I'm gonna go hurry her up. [knocking] Lizzy? Lizzy? Taxi? What? Oh, God! Lizzy! - What's wrong? - Lizzy just took off in a black coloured cab. I couldn't get the plates, I... Oh God, she... she... she took the envelope from the travel agency. I think she's going to the airport. - By herself? Why? - I don't know, I have no idea. I'm gonna call the cab company now. You get your car, I'll get mine. Let's just go find her. - Going to the airport all by yourself? - I'm meeting my mom there. She's waiting for me. - You can hold on to that until we get there, OK? So, going someplace fun? - Germany. I have family there. - Cool! I've never been there. Someday, though. - I've never been there either. It's my first time. But I might not come back. I mean, if I like it. - [Will, did you pick up a fare at 2213 Magnolia?] - Yup. On our way to airport. - [Is it a little girl?] - Yeah. - [Need you to return to that location immediately.] [Her mother's frantic. She ran away.] - Copy that. - No, keep going to the airport! - It's not up to me. - I don't wanna go back home! - Like I said, it's not up to me. Hey! She just jumped out of my car and took off. She's heading west down Piper just past the bridge. - Hello? - [This is dispatch for the cab company.] [I just spoke to the driver. He said she jumped out of the car] [at 46th and Piper. She left her suitcase in the trunk] [and started running west.] - Thank you. Thank you so much. Call Allie. - Hey. - [OK, I just got off the phone with the dispatcher.] Lizzy jumped out of the cab at Piper [just past the bridge. She's headed, uh...] She's headed west. - Alright, I'm like two blocks away. - [OK, go. I'll meet you there.] Please be OK. Please be OK. - Excuse me, can I have the number for... Never mind. - Hey. She just went inside a pizza place on McNutt. - I'll be there in two minutes. - Lizzy! Lizzy, come out! Lizzy, come out! - Go away! - I'm not gonna go away! Your mom is worried sick! Lizzy, it's too noisy out here. I'm gonna call you. [phone ringing] - Please, just leave me alone. - There's no way in hell I'm leaving you at a pizza shop by yourself. Your mom's on the way. - I don't want her here either! - Why did you leave? - Because the police are going to arrest me. - For what? - It's all my fault. Ms. Mila fell down and hit her head. She was going to call Mom and send me home and I was just... trying to get the phone away from her. I didn't mean for anything bad to happen. - Oh my God... - I'm in so much trouble. And I think I'm going crazy. I don't know what to do. - It's gonna be alright. Your mom and my dad and I... we're all here to help you. - I don't want help. I just wanna leave. - Well, you can't run away from your problems, sis. It just makes them worse. - If I can just get to the castle in Germany, they won't let the police take me. - But then you'd be a fugitive and you could never come home. And we would all miss you. - You wouldn't miss me. - I would completely miss you. Who else would I have to fight with? - Everyone hates me. - Nobody hates you, Lizzy. We all love you. - Even after you find out all the bad things I've done? - Like what? - I'm the one who put vinegar on Greg's painting. - Really? Why? - 'Cause I didn't want you guys to come to Germany. I was going to put poison ivy on your pyjama so you couldn't go. - You were? That's pretty nasty. - See? I knew it. I knew you'd hate me if I told you that! - Nice try, but I still don't hate you. And I'm pretty sure Dad knew that you were the one that did the vinegar. - He did? - He never said, but... yeah. - He wasn't mad? - Of course he was mad. Just like I would've been super pissed about the poison ivy. But... we still want you to be in our family. I wish you liked us the way that we like you. Just, like... you think this family in Germany is so much better than we are... And it kinda hurts my feelings. - Sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, I just... I just wanted to be a princess. - What's wrong with being like me and your mom and our dad? Just normal people who... wake up and go to work and go to school and wear clothes from The Gap? It's actually pretty cool. - Will you come with me to the police? - Of course. That's what big sisters do, right? - And Mom, too? - I'm right here, honey. I'll be by your side the whole time. I love you, kiddo. I hope you're not sitting on the floor of the public bathroom, by the way. - Are you coming out? 'Cause if so, I'm gonna order a few ice-blended mochas with chocolate syrup. Plus, I think that there's a guy out here who really has to pee. He's dancing around with his legs crossed. [chuckling] - Yeah. I'm coming out. - Oh, God... You scared me to death. Are you OK? - I'm sorry, Mom. - You're such a pain in the butt. - So, three iced mochas with extra whipped cream? - My treat. - I'm sorry, Mom. I'll never do that again. - Good. Hey... come. - I think the tassel goes on the other side, right? - No, Dad. It stays on this side until after I graduate. - Are you sure? Alright. - Hey, you all set? Oh, don't forget to take your pill. Dr. Harmon says it's your last bottle and you're all done. - I know, I'm doing good, huh? I don't even have bad dreams anymore. - I know. Your therapist says you're making great progress. What's that? - Just something for Allie. - Come on. - Alright, it's all set, guys! Smile! [shutter clicking] - You ready, honey? - I wanna give Allie something first. - "Love, Lizzy". I think this card is meant for somebody else. - No, silly. It's for you. - Alright, let's get going before we miss it! Closed Captioning by SETTE inc.
