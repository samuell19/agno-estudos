There's actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And a compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of God or spiritual type thing for worship... [Levi] Agnes, you gotta come out and look at these tomatoes. They're huge! [man on TV] ...be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles, means that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. [Levi] Please come out to the garden, now. All right, all right, I was just trying to unwind. [Levi] Your idea of unwinding is most people's idea of winding themselves up into a frenzy of fear and self-loathing. [Agnes chuckling] Oh, my God. Yes. A thousand times yes. We gladly accept. Who's we? That's a perfect segue, actually. Um, I wanted to talk to you about something. Turns out, looks like, by the way, I'm pregnant. Surprise. - [laughing] - Yeah, I'm pregnant. [laughing] - Really? - [Agnes] Yeah. - [Jewish wedding music] - [people cheering] Agnes! Welcome to the family, Agnes! Wonderful. Ah, to life! To life! L'chaim! L'chaim, I'chaim, to life! [crosstalk] [Agnes] You're all here. [Mortimer] Oh, Glaucia and Abe didn't make it because Glaucia has a new serum launch. That's tonight. ♪ [Mortimer] All right, you get the moment. Do you want to put some pants on? Yes. Yes, I'd like to go put on some pants. Thank you so much. Thank you. [Mortimer] You know what, Ruthie? - What? - We're going to be grandparents! [family cheering] [Mortimer singing "Hava Nagila"] [Levi laughing] Who hired the photographer? [Levi] My mom. [Agnes] You could have warned me. I asked her not to do it. [Agnes] I was about to shower, but you rushed my process. I'm sorry. Oh, Levi, it's so beautiful. Thank you. We're doing it. Wait, having the baby, or getting married? Both. I'm glad you're glad, because up until right now I was completely freaked out about it. If you don't feel like you're ready to have a baby, I get that. No, no, I mean, strangely, I want to. Have it. [Levi] You have to be completely honest. I am being honest. Do you? I do. I want this baby. I feel... I don't even know if there's a word for how I feel. [Agnes] What were you going to tell me about? This class or something? Oh, um... I enrolled us in Journey Through Judaism class. Meets every week, you can get the whole process started, especially if we want to have a wedding before the baby comes. Wait, wait, wait. What... what process? Your conversion. I'm converting? Yeah. I'm... I'm pretty sure we talked about this. No. So... [sighing] Okay, you know how I went to Catholic school, right? And I had all the Catholic sacraments, except marriage, and so, if there is a God, she probably already sees me as being part of the Catholic persuasion, and beyond that I'm a devout atheist, so... Which is why we're taking the class with the wonderful, intelligent, sensitive, feminist, the incomparable, Rabbi Cohen. I know it's going to be a little awkward, but I love my family and this is really important to them. Your parents love me. Parents generally love me. Yeah, I know, of course they do. And it's the 21st century. I mean, we don't live in the shtetl anymore. I have a cousin, Jake, who is totally estranged from the family all because his wife didn't convert. Totally estranged or, just, they're a little upset? Totally estranged. Once you convert, you will be my Jewish wife. Our children will automatically be Jews. We don't have to be conservative or keep kosher and all that stuff, it's just that my mom and my dad want to know that their grandchildren are part of the tribe, officially. And, in Judaism, one's Jewish identity is seen as passed through the mother. That's a lot. Yeah. The conversion can be symbolic. They love you. I love you. More than anything. I'm asking you to do it for me. To marry the man of my dreams? Seems like a small sacrifice. [pill bottle opening] [pills rattling] Eat. My. Ass. Eat. My. Ass. [dog whining] [Levi] If I put it in my batter, it would make my batter bitter, but a bit of better butter, that would make my batter better, so Betty Botter bought a bit of better... - What are you doing? - Warming up my instrument. Okay, let's go. - [Levi] Are you ready? - Let's... Yeah, let's do this. All right. Great. And... Action. Gimme my money, dawg. I need my money. Eat. My. Ass. Cut. Cut, cut, cut. Are you actually going to do it like that? Well, how would you do it? Well, I mean, I might do it kind of like, uh... Eat my ass. Okay, thanks Daniel Day, but I think I'm going to stick to my version. Can we do it one more time? Like, a few more times? Please? - Please? - We're going to be late for our first meeting with the Rabbi. All right. - One more time. You ready? - Okay. Yeah. And... action. Eat. My. Ass. [both laughing] Back to one. We gotta do it again, that was your fault. It was kind of brilliant. - You can't cut me out? - [Agnes] No. [traffic din] [quirky music] [computer keyboard clacking] Oy gevalt, Rabbi Cohen, we are ever so sorry for being so appallingly late. That's okay, come on in. You can hang your coats over there if you're warm. Oh, I'm... I'm a bit chilly, actually, so, I'm... I'm going to keep mine on for now. So, Rabbi. What do you think about the Maccabees? The Maccabees? I was just reading this article online that posited that the Maccabees, when you really get down to it, are not unlike the Jewish Taliban. Oh, wow. Well, uh, that statement could be construed as wildly antisemitic. I just wanted to get your scholarly, rabbinical opinion. [Cohen] I think the question here is, uh, why we'd be making that comparison in the first place? [Agnes] Right. Um, I'd love to be the one to smash the glass at the wedding, if possible. If not, that's also completely fine. It has traditionally been "the man" who smashes the glass at the wedding. However, my partner and I both smashed a glass at our wedding, so, it's a Choose Your Own Adventure kind of thing as far as I'm concerned. That's what I said. Oh. Your hair's falling out. Oh, wow, um... did you know that female pattern baldness affects one in five women under the age of 35? - Oh. - It's... it's tragic, really. I'm so sorry about that. [Agnes] Um... [Levi clearing throat] Is there anything, uh, we can do to prepare for our first class next week? Oh, wow, our 45 minutes are up, unfortunately. Levi can fill you in on the rest, I think. Uh, I'm late for a bris, so, I've got to scoot. Enjoy the bris. Thank you, I always do. - [Agnes] Bye. - See you next week. Bye. [door shutting] [quirky music] [Agnes] Let's go sit in the park and share a cruffin. On the house. I can turn tricks for baked goods. I'm just going to have something at my desk later, okay? I messed up, didn't I? No. It's all good. We'll have another meeting. I've got to get back to the office, I'm drowning in depositions. What are you going to do for the rest of the day? Hmm, after school. Before that, no idea. Why don't you go by Maude's, see if she's got any new projects? Maybe you could read for something, right? - [Levi] Love you. - Love you, too. ♪ [Maude] They're uneducated, self-loathing, antisemitic, philandering Hollywood pricks, that don't know the first thing about the theater. Oh, sh... Come bearing lunch. No cursing, no cursing. I'm on a cleanse. A verbal cleanse. It's been a rough day and I'm looking for a little calm. Did you take your meds today, sweetheart? I cursed in front of a first-grader last week and I still feel guilty about it. I've been Hail Mary-ing non-stop and it's not helping. You pray? Well, I'm superstitious, so, as you can imagine, religion is very triggering for me. Now I'm about to be a role model 24/7 because, guess what, I'm pregnant. Terrific. Oy vey, you got yourself knocked up? Seriously? What... what? Of course they'll forget you. The successful ones, they always do. Didn't I write all the tech avails in an email? Well... [scoffs] What is the point of email if nobody reads the whole thing? Louise! I'm going to have to ask... I'm... I'm getting another ca... Louise! Oh, screw it. I mean... Where is my intern and what is her name? That... that... that zounderkite. [Sheldon] We had to let her go. Budget cuts. We don't have interns anymore. What is a zounderkite? How is that because of budget cuts when we never paid the interns? And if you're going to be restricting my speech, my dear, I am going to have to get creative, sweet cheeks. Zounderkite means idiot. And the intern's name was Anya, or Avra, or Omelette or some fakakta name. [Maude] Well, where is that freaking piece of paper with all the tech avails on it? [groaning] Oh, oh, Lane Bryant, laced brazier, $12.99. Huh, you know, this seafoam green color would look great on you. Oh, thank you for the cheese steak. Your Reuben's on your desk, Shel. Would you like to see the brazier Please don't flash me, Maude. Not today. Whoo! [laughing] Oh, you... You've lost your sense of fun. Where's the old Agnes? I miss her. Maude, is there anything I can read for? I'm desperate for a role. One line in anything. Nothing. Nothing. You're not diverse. Directors want diverse, and not pregnant. Yeah. Oh, oh... casting. Willhelm, I freaking told you, read the freaking email, okay? Yes, I love Morgan Freeman, too, okay, but even if it wasn't because he was already booked for the next ten pictures, he would not do your rotten turd of a movie. Why? Because he's a movie star! That's why! Ugh. Here, have a bite. I... I don't want a bite. You're pregnant, have a bite. All right. [classroom chatter] My bad. Um, hey, I'm looking for drama. Right this way. [children] Agnes! Hi. Hello. Sparrow, come, it's time to go. No, Dad. Sandy just dropped me off. I know, I made a mistake. You've got your ukulele lesson in... In ten minutes. I know I overbooked you. Come on. Dad, get it together. Agnes, do you want to meet my pet wig? I brought her in especially for theater games today. Her name is Marianne. Hi, Marianne. Honey, look, I'm sorry, all right? We'll reorganize your schedule tonight and, uh, we'll be back next week, yeah? It's surprising how many extra-curricular activities a seven-year-old has. I want to do the dating game. I don't want to go to ukulele. [children] Dating game! Dating game! Dating game! Dating game, what's that, a teaching method I'm not aware of? Yelling at the teacher? [children] Yell at the teacher! Yell at the teacher! Yell at the teacher! [boy with headgear] Time is money, ladies. Indeed. Come on, baby, we gotta go. Come on, come on, come on. Okay. [grunting] Thank you. It was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Be well, everyone. Next week. - [children] Bye, Sparrow. - Bye, Sparrow. See you next week. Okay, how about we play First Female President? I feel like the dating game isn't really socially relevant or P.C. anymore. [children] Dating game! Dating game! Dating game! Dating game! All right, welcome to the dating game. We have some beautiful candidates here this evening. First, I'd like to start off with our bachelorette. Please introduce yourself, bachelorette. Hello, I am Ms. Mustachio. Ms. Mustachio is so excited to meet her soul mate today. Uh, Ms. Mustachio, what is your favorite flavor of ice cream? Probably birthday cake, cookies and cream and strawberry. Three flavors, everyone. Let's meet the candidates. We have this fine, young gentleman. What is your name? Mr. Robot. Do you have any hobbies, Mr. Robot? [children laughing] Uh, not swimming because that would break me, and I don't have a hobby and I just jump in butt. Okay. All right, it's getting late. Kids are tired. [upbeat music] I told David that Levi's fiancé isn't Jewish yet, but she will be. Yeah, Agnes is determined to be as Jewish as she possibly can be. Abe and Glaucia just joined our synagogue. They got off the waiting list yesterday. How's Agnes? Good. Uh, she just had a big audition. Well, for what? Film, I think? Uh, what... what's the role? President. [clearing throat] Of the United States. [Mortimer] Oh, that's perfect. - I hope she gets it. - Me, too. And she's excited about converting? She's thrilled to convert and happy about it. [clearing throat] And she's feeling well? The pregnancy's going smoothly? Um, so far so good. I'm on my way uptown to the office. Priya said you had the Smithfield chemical file. Yes, yes. Handle with care. Thanks. [Mortimer] I'm getting old, Levi. It's good to know that our clients are in such capable hands. Uh, both of my boys becoming men, getting married, carrying on the traditions of our people. So glad we didn't have to go through the drama of Uncle Josh's family. They were just... Uh, they were devastated when Jake didn't marry within the faith and then, uh, what's-her-name wouldn't even convert. - Maureen. - What? Maureen. That's Jake's wife. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Uh, she's an Irish Catholic. Oy-oy-oy-oy. So, you and Agnes, uh, will be making an appearance at the Feltshew Shiva, uh, on Sunday? Yeah, uh, who died? Shmoo? No, no, no, no. Bubbie Feltshew. Great lady. Yeah, she was. A lot of chutzpah. Daphna will be there with the Levinsons. Why are you telling me that? Well, because, uh, you were friends and, uh, lovers for a very long time. I thought you might like to know. Lovers? Dad, Daphna's my ex. I don't want to hear about her. Roger that. All right, see you in court tomorrow. Okay, I'll see you in court tomorrow. - Take care, take care. - Bye, Dad. - [cell phone ringing] - Ah... Oh Yes, yes, Your Honor, how are you? [solemn violin music] [Latin accent] I've been so furiously busy with my new web series on [speaking foreign language] yoga-lates, and the serum launch, of course. And now with the two weddings, the one in Lisbon and the one here in Brooklyn... It's exciting. So exciting. Um, can I ask you a question about your business, Glaucia Eduarda? It's actually Glaucia. Eduarda. That's what I said. And my business is a top 500 company, and requires no quotation marks. Oh, I did... I didn't... mean to put... I didn't put quotation marks around it. I just said... Mm. I guess it was your tone, then. Agnes, uh, by the way, don't mention Abe and Glaucia Eduarda going to city hall. Why not? I was going to tweet it. Shout it from the rooftops. Abe and Eduarda got hitched! It's Glaucia Eduarda. They got engaged right after we did. Whoo-hoo. Well, we completed the administrative procedure. But we don't want this to detract from the main event. We only went to city hall to expedite the process. [slurping wine] [Agnes] First of all, I don't understand the whole detracting from the main event thing. And, um, secondly, I thought you were going to elope? We wanted to embrace our Jewish identities, and celebrate with the family. In the faith. [Agnes] Hmm. [Levi clearing throat] Oh, did you guys hear that Glaucia Eduarda was actually offered a role on a pilot? I mean, they basically just wanted her to play herself and... And rep her brand on the show. My patients are too important to me. [Agnes] Patients? I thought... I thought you were a yoga teacher? That's merely one aspect of what I do. Do you follow me on Instagram? No, no, no, I don't, um, engage with... the social media. And why is that? It makes people depressed. It's generally not good for you. That opinion is actually just a symptom of an overall intellectual backlash. Well, it's not really an opinion, its science, but... Mm, agree to disagree. The entertainment industry is fun, but it's not serious enough for me, at least. And the way they treat women in Hollywood, it's savage, isn't it? You know what? I think that women in Hollywood have never been more empowered. [Levi] Hmm. I think that. Because... a lot of reasons. For example, I auditioned to play a very strong, powerful, confident strong, woman. A sex worker who... makes tough choices based on difficult economic realities. How was your day, Levi? Oh, my day was pretty good. Uh, we had one witness kind of get cold feet, so we're going to have to rethink that strategy, but, otherwise... [smooching] Oh, here you go. Oh, no, sadly I... I cannot imbibe. I am... with child. Of course. Mazel, mazel. How brave of you two. Yeah, no, it wasn't really brave, it was just more careless. Stupid. A little bit spontaneous, is what I'm trying to say, and, uh, what I'm really trying to say is that it wasn't planned, so... as you might have guessed. Um, okay, well, in the spirit of giving up on my dreams, will you please pass me one of those... - breads? - Mm. These are actually buckwheat naan toasts. Better for the baby. Oh, so it's, like, all seeds. Yeah. It's healthy. Not... not really bread. You'll get used to it. Mm. Delicious. Mm. You have two of those in the morning, a little espresso. Keeps you, uh, regular. [Agnes] Mm-hmm. What's for dessert? Hibiscus ice cubes. [Abe] Mm. Sheer arrogance. The hypocrisy. Who cares? We get to live our lives, we get to be together. You and me and Ernie and the baby. [Agnes laughing] Fortune 500 company? Give me a break. We only have to sit through one of those dinners one time a month. You gotta learn to put things in perspective. You're right. You're so wise. Yes, I am. [bittersweet music] - [Levi] Oh. - [Ernie barking] [Agnes] Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Let me help you up. Stay away from me, you dirty shiksa. Whoa, lady, you're the one covered in garbage, okay? Let me help you up. - [woman screaming] - Whoa, Jesus Christ, lady. We're trying to help you, all right? [woman] That's your problem. Jesus Christ. He's Jewish, he's a member of the tribe. Don't waste your breath. These people think I'm an animal because I'm not orthodox. - That doesn't make any sense. - I know. It's an extremist cult, it doesn't need to make any sense. In fact, the more irrational, the better. Let's go home. Okay. [Levi clearing throat] [classical music playing] [children humming] Any progress with the masterpiece? [sighing] Right now it's just an empty canvas. I'm thinking of keeping it that way. Ah, yes. The minimalist approach. The highest form of cubist abstraction. The penultimate. You know, my dad says a lot of writers experience periods of intense inactivity. But even if you're not putting pen to paper, your mind is working. It may feel like you don't exist, but you do. You're all perfectionists. That's your problem. Me, I'm just... completely out of ideas. I'm completely boring. [Sparrow] That's silly, Frankie. You're a fascinating, multi-dimensional woman. Agreed. And you look stunning today, by the way. I haven't washed my hair in two weeks. Do you know what Margaret Atwood says about perfectionism? That it slowly, quietly kills you? Yes. If I waited for perfection I'd never write a word. So, procrastination is really just a bad habit that stems from a desire to not fail. [Frankie] Exactly. Why don't you just Jackson Pollock that canvas? Show it who's boss. Your idea of what I do is hilarious. So actor-y. Jackson Pollock is so old. He's deceased, actually. I think it's an accurate reference. I mean, the term "action painting" was basically invented for him, so... At least you get to be, I don't know, physical. You get to punch out those letters on the keyboard. Plus, acting is very physical. If only someone would allow me to do it. Allow you? Come on, Agnes. Push that rock up the hill yourself. Put your big girl pants on and get on with it. Make your own opportunities. [Frankie] Maybe we should swap for a week. You give me your act two, I'll lend you the keys my studio? Hmm? Hmm? Oh, Frankie, Sparrow and I made something for you. Oh! Ah, it's very on trend. I love it. Oh, fudge. [gasping] Frankie almost said the "F" word. Then she didn't. She said fudge. Can you teach my Zumba class for me tonight? Sudima has an opening. It's an all-female production of All My Sons, and I completely forgot about it, but I promised her I'd go. She's been working on it for years. Okay, but... Fabulous, I'll text you the deets. [thumping] Oh, my God. Uh... Frankie, take Leah and Henry to the office. Call 911 and then Sparrow's dad. You're going to feel a lot better soon, I promise. [somber music] Hey, where is she? How long was the seizure? - Did you time it? - It was about ten minutes. She went with the E.M.T.s and the school nurse to the hospital. Okay. ♪ [Fred] And now shut up and eat.

It is? Because I was kind of freaked out initially, but... Because it wasn't planned. Yeah. The best things in life are not. Uh, how's the play going? [sighing] I don't want to talk about it. Oh. You must persevere, my dear. No daughter of mine, especially a grand one, gives up. You know, you do realize I am your only living offspring, so, maybe it might have been a good idea if mom had given up her singing career and all the drugs that went with it. You and your mother are not the same person. She was vulnerable to certain pitfalls of the business, but you've learned from her mistakes. You come the way you come. You're saying I'm crazy so I should just lean in? [Nate] I think you're an artist. And everybody's a little bit crazy. Never trust anyone who claims to be normal. Well, I love you both, but I gotta run. Where are you off to now? Zumba class. Wh... Wh... Zu-Zu... What... what's a Zumba? Um, it's like dance. - I think. - Oh. - Bye. - Bye bye bye. - Bye-bye, my darling. - [Agnes] See you soon. Love you. I... I do the Zumba pretty well. [Fred] I bet you do. [laughing] Zumba. Hello, ladies. Sexy gay man. Uh, my name is Agnes and I will be filling in this evening for Frankie. - [Zumba music playing] - This is what I like to call, um, radical acceptance Zumba. Which is to say, it's not exactly kosher Zumba or Zumba as you may have done it before. Rule number one: there are no rules. There are no right steps, there are no wrong steps. Simply steps. Uh, what about stretching? Stretching is not a part of our fitness philosophy here at radical Zumba because we simply do whatever we want. I want you to laugh. Cry, burp, fart, scream, whatever feels right to you in the moment. Don't hold back, okay? Because this is your time, ladies, and sexy gay man. So, leave your Lululemons at home because this is an authentic, screw the patriarchy, women's lib kind of workout. I would say burn your bras, but don't do that, because the only person that hurts is you. Bras are important. We need all the support we can get. The world will try and knock you down, but today we are building ourselves back the fudge up. So, work it. Show me what you got. Leave it all on this dance floor, right here, right now. Because life is short and cruel, so let's have some freaking fun for once. [sexy gay man] Are you on the schedule next week? ♪ [Levi clearing throat] I was teaching a Zumba class. You do Zumba? I do now. [Cohen] Hello, everybody, and thank you for being here. We are so thrilled to have you at our Journey Through Judaism fall semester. My name is Rabbi Jane Cohen, I'm new at the synagogue, and you all are my first Journey Through Judaism class ever! Come on. Oh, yeah. Wow, okay, so, b'ezrat HaShem, which means "with God's help," let's get to the point. Tachles, for those of you who don't know, means, uh, getting to the point. Getting to the quintessence of something. It's something Israelis say when they want to say "get to the point," essentially. Okay, I am repeating myself. Yeah, let's, uh, hm-mm... We're... we're... we're going to start every class with our weekly simchas and sorrows. A simcha, for those of you who don't know, means "a little joy." Something small, can be anything. Uh, does anybody have a simcha they'd like to share for the week? Oh, and if you could, um, introduce yourself and tell us why you're here, enrolled, that would be great as well. I... I... I'm Virginia. - [breathy chuckling] - [Cohen] Mazel tov. My simcha for the day is that, yesterday, I became a grandmother. Lovely. A baby is a blessing. The highest blessing. Mazel tov. Any sorrows? I have sorrows. My name is Zeynep. I am from Istanbul. And I am curious about the Jewish and I... I want to convert to the Jewish because of rich history. Uh, my sorrow is: my ferret, Yasmin, died this morning. Tragically. Uh, she got stuck in the, uh, how do you call it, the... the... The escalator machine at the grocery store. Uh, it was a mess and, uh, she... Lots of blood and, uh, her body was taken away and, uh, I will never see her again. I am so sorry, Zeynep. Speaking of... unfortunate female figures that we will never forget, um, let's just get to our first parsha. Um, the story of Rachel and Leah. If you will please turn to page 94. You will see there that Leah, one of the matriarchs of the Jewish people, is described as tender, because she had been crying. Why is that, do you ask? Well, Leah had been consigned to marry Esau, Jacob's older brother. Now, Esau was the more aggressive, less desirable of the two brothers. He was a fan of hunting and brothels. Jacob, on the other hand... Iconic Jacob... He was a real mensch, the tzadik, the righteous one, if you will. In other words, God's personal emissary, that's... Rabbi, didn't Jacob and Esau's father, Laban, get involved? And I thought... Yes, yes, he did, and I was just about to get... And what about those, uh, slutty slave women who come later in the story, like Zilpah and Bilhah? [Cohen] Yes, Zeynep, they do... They were just about to come. I mean, I guess now that we're on the subject, Bilhah and Zilpah are... I think she's hitting on you. That's because I'm ridiculously good-looking. Ca
