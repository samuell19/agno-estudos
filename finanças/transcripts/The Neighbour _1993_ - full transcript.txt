THE NEIGHBOUR Who's a good birdie, then? lt's 1 0 to 8 and time for the weather on Radio Vienna. The late summer weather will hold; in the afternoon, however, thunderstorms are forecast for the east of Austria. Temperatures will be between 22 and 2 5 degrees Celsius. Leave the curtains today, wiII you? -Leave them? My eyes, you know. So tired today. It's not going to hoId anyway. They've forecast thunderstorms. It's good coffee, Mr. PawIik, thank you. I'II Ieave the magazines for you. -Oh, yes, thank you. WeII, it's time I was off now. It's getting Iate. Morning, Mr. PawIik. Do you think we'II get a thunderstorm? And what'II it be today, Mrs. Schneider? Oh, just some fiction ... two romances, two miIitary. My husband says he doesn't want any more about the Russian campaign. TeII me, is it true that oId Mrs. SmekaI's very iII? What? Who's been saying that? -WeII, I don't remember who I got that from. She's just a bit tired aII the time and that's aII. The things peopIe taIk about aII the time. Not a word of it true. Yes, don't they? Nothing but gossip aII day Iong. Huh? Not much of a job, is it? A woman Iike you deserves something better than this. Oh, weII, things can change. Listen, I've got something to do right now but ... are you doing anything after work? Can I see you then? I don't have much time. WeII, then. See you Iater. Good evening. Evening. Won't be Iong. EIena's nearIy finished. What are you doing there? BIack naiI varnish? It doesn't suit you at aII. I've got someone coming ... he Iikes me to wear it. There are some funny peopIe around. ShaII I get it now? If you'd be so kind. I'II pay now, too. Time to wake up. Supper. The news. MeatIoaf, parsIey potatoes. Not bad. Mrs. SmekaI? I'II ring the poIice. You have to ring the poIice. WeII, she was quite an age, wasn't she? And aIone, more or Iess. Excuse me, my mother wants to know what's happened. Mrs. SmekaI, the woman who Iived here, has died. -Dead? Yes, dead. Mr. PawIik, may I offer my condoIences? It must be a great Ioss to you. My heartfeIt sympathy. Come on, have a cigarette. Can't do any harm. One must aIways have the strength to keep going. Excuse me. Good-bye. Wait, I'II open the other door. OK. -Thanks. Steady back there. Good night. Good morning. Good morning. I'd Iike two Iove stories for my sister, she's in hospitaI. I don't have any Iove stories. But there's a whoIe piIe Iying there. There - take them. Free. Leave me in peace and don't come back. Where's your saucepan? Aren't you taking anything with you today? Not today, Miss Sonja. And by the way, not tomorrow, either. -In fact, never again. -What? I won't be taking anything with me ever again. -Oh. Right. WouId you teII them in the kitchen, so that they don't cook anything speciaIIy. Yes, I'II teII them. Good that you toId me. 'Bye. Is anybody there? Good evening. 'Evening. What are you doing here? What about you? I'm from next door. I knew Mrs. SmekaI. The door was open. WaIIs need repainting every three years. Look at the state this pIace is in. My fIat's repainted every three years. Excuse me, but who are you exactIy? Excuse me ... I'm her son. -Her s ... ? What, she had a son? Yeah, me. WeII. If that's so, then ... ... my heartfeIt sympathy. PawIik's the name. I aIways brought your mother her supper, ever since she couIdn't get up anymore. Yeah, yeah, OK. Hey, what are you doing? Leave that there. Nothing's to be touched - understand? They beIong to me. I aIways brought them for Mrs. SmekaI. Free. If you'd visited your mother at aII you'd have known that. Listen, I don't need any reproaches from you. WeII, Herbert, have you found a decent job yet? Look at the way you're dressed, Herbert. I'II give you a thousand schiIIings if you buy yourseIf a nice suit, Herbert. That's aII I heard, the whoIe time. I won't stand for it. There, keep that oId rubbish. I'm chucking everything out anyway, the furniture, curtains ... I'II do it up, the way I Iike it. ReaIIy styIish. -Do you mean ... you're going to move in here? -Cheap fIat, Iarge enough. You know what that is? It's shabby, that's what it is! You never Iooked after her, but as soon as your mother's ... She's hardIy ... you come here and ... the very next evening. It's appaIIing. Outrageous. Great. And now get out! -How dare you! I've more right to be here than you. -Get out of my fIat, I said. And in future mind your own business, neighbour. You owe me sixty schiIIings. -Oh, reaIIy? That's a good one. -For her supper. I fetched it for Mrs. SmekaI from the pub. WeII, did she eat it? No, she was aIready dead. I found her when I brought it round. WeII, then. I'm not paying for it. -But that's absoIuteIy ... She didn't eat it so I'm not paying. That's my motto. Out! Let go of me. You can't do this! You Iout! You'II regret this. You're a Iout! A Iout! ... it'II be over soon, you'II see, it won't be for Iong. Oh, Iook. There she goes again. Young SmekaI's bit of fIuff. Every day at haIf-past five she goes off in a taxi. AIways in a taxi. See ... it's not normaI, I'm teIIing you. -So what? She's probabIy going to work. -WeII, yes. But what sort of work? In the evening? By taxi? Oh, weII, it's none of my business. But peopIe say she's one of those ... One of those what? -Oh, go on with you, Mr. PawIik, you know what I mean. Must be going, 'Bye. Mrs. Schneider! I'II teII you one thing. She's not one of those. -WeII, goodness, I don't think so either. But you know how peopIe taIk. 'Bye. Won't you come inside? I might just have something for you. Do you Iike animaIs? What's Gerti. Here's something to read for you. When you've read them, bring them back and I'II give you some new ones. -Thanks. Ahah! You can even taIk. What's your name, then? -Agnes. Good-bye. Bye-bye, Agnes. What's the matter? You're cIosing aIready? Yes. Today I'm cIosing earIy. But - why? You'II have to come back tomorrow ... Good-bye. Good-bye. So you want me to foIIow that taxi? -Yes, pIease. Hurry! OK, if you want. D'you want me to wait? Perhaps she's going on somewhere eIse? -No, no. PIease go. Go! What d'you want? Need some change? -Yes, pIease. Is MichaeIa on now - in there? -We don't have a MichaeIa. But that's a photo of her! -That's ChantaI. It says so. ChantaI's on next. Trixi's on at the moment. Nice girI. Er - yes. Thanks. First time here? I noticed straight away - aII embarassed and shy. But honestIy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. Just Iooking at something young and fresh. Forbidden fruit. Look - I'm married, I Iove my wife, I mean that sincereIy, but she's got to understand my coming here. Nothing wrong with it. WeII then, go on ... just go in. Forbidden fruit. TeII me, can you be seen inside? No, you have to take a private cubicIe for that. But I don't want to be seen. -WeII, then ... don't bother. It's nothing to be ashamed of, honestIy. PIease wouId you give this to Miss ChantaI. I can reIy on you? -Yeah, sure. Thank you. And who have we got here? Were you coming to see me? I've finished them. -Finished them? You're a quick reader, aren't you? Come on, come in. What's she caIIed? Gerti. Oh, yes, I knew that aIready. Can you whistIe? Try it. Who's that? That's me. When I was young. And that's your wife? That was my wife. Is she dead? -No ... that is, perhaps. I don't know. We didn't want to Iive together any more when I came back from the war. Makes you nervous, that constant ticking. aII the time. What can I get you? Are you hungry? I'II get you something from the restaurant, aII right? Yes, pIease. -AII right, but you stay here. I'II be back straight away. I'II just write a note for your mother to say you're here. Red, red, bIack, bIack, red, red ... Where's the bIack one? WeII? But I couId have sworn ... Yeah, Luck's a fickIe Iady, isn't she? Right, here you are. That'II be fifty-six. Just Iike oId times. Hey, Iove - bring us another pint, wiII you? Just a moment, this gentIeman wants to pay. Oho - my oId neighbour, Mr. Nosy-parker? He can wait, Iove, he's been waiting aII his Iife and nothing's ever turned up. That's your neighbour? He's fuII of himseIf, your neighbour. Thinks he's God's gift to mankind. There'II be some peopIe who beIieve him. So, red, red, bIack, bIack, red, red. And ... where's the bIack one? Sorry, mate, Iost again. The worId is fuII of mysteries. The fIat Iooks quite good, doesn't it? I ran into my oId boss the other day. I couId start there again whenever I want. Don't be stupid! You're not a waitress. Better than what I'm doing now, at any rate. What's the matter? What's the matter with you? Come here. Sit down. You know we need to get the capitaI together. What's the matter aII of a sudden? The job isn't aII that bad, is it? No, it's onIy ... if peopIe find out and Agnes ... If she finds out, then ... -Nobody's going to find out - how couId they? You've got to take risks if you want to get anywhere. When we've got the money together for the nightcIub, Iife'II be different, reaIIy. It's worth it, isn't it? Yes. See! But - wiII it work out? I mean, wiII there be enough money? -Of course, it'II take quite a time. You know how we couId get the money together more quickIy, but you won't do it. OK, I'm not forcing you. I've never forced you to do anything, have I? No. We'II manage it together. Life wiII be different, won't it? Yes. We just have to trust each other. Yes, but the sky isn't red, is it? -Yes, it is! D'you think so? WeII, you're probabIy right. So you're one of those, are you? You just wait! Afternoon, Mr. PawIik. You shouIdn't give her presents aII the time, Mr.PawIik. -It's onIy a smaII thing. You're not iII, are you? You Iook so tired. -No, no. Perhaps a bit tired, you're right. As a waitress you're on your feet the whoIe evening, you know. Yes, I know. She shouId be in bed by 9 o'cIock. I'II make sure she is, don't you worry. Er ... I wanted to ask you something ... to ask you if ... I wanted to take you out, both of you, to the Prater, perhaps, and for something to eat afterwards. You and Agnes. That's very kind of you, but ... I have to work. -But you're free on Monday evenings. How do you know that? I toId him. Yes, we taIk about aII sorts of things, you know. And I thought we three couId go to the Prater. Or somewhere eIse. -That's very kind of you, but I reaIIy don't have the time. Good-bye. Don't be afraid - it's me. I didn't want to frighten you. WeII, you made a good job of it. -I am sorry. I just wanted to make you a proposaI. What sort of proposaI? No, not here. Won't you come in for a moment ... have a gIass of wine with me? No, reaIIy not. I'm tired and I want to go home. I understand. Work and everything. When can I speak to you? -We see each other aII the time. No, I mean speak to you properIy, in peace and quiet. You know, I've been thinking about it for a Iong time. You're a woman who shouId be spoiIed, who shouId be given fIowers and ... I'm not badIy off, Miss MichaeIa. You shouId know that I've aIways Iived aIone ... my needs are very modest ... As you can imagine it's come to a tidy sum over the years. That's very nice for you. But you're tired, I'm just keeping you, I'm sorry. We'II meet in peace and quiet and I'II expIain my proposaI to you. What sort of proposaI? It's the best for aII of us. You'II see. Good night, Miss MichaeIa and sIeep weII. Good night. The best for aII of us, not onIy for me. For Agnes and for you, too. Good night. SIeep weII. I've toId Turek time and again not to shoot at the pigeons. He shoots the pigeons and then they rot in the guttering. HonestIy, we can't have that. My goodness, it's Mr. PawIik! Why - what's happened to you? -Don't you Iike it? Yes, of course. It's IoveIy, isn't it? Very smart. Makes you Iook younger. SpoiIing yourseIf for once, who'd have thought it? WeII, one's probabIy negIected oneseIf a bit over the years. Good-bye. I'II be aIong shortIy for a coupIe of romances. I'm cIosed today. You'II have to wait tiII tomorrow. You're cIosed? Yes. An important appointment. Good-bye. What sort of appointment? Oh, Iook - there are stiII men around who know how to treat a woman. Come in, go on through. No. Today I just wanted to ... I just wanted to say good-bye to you both. Say good-bye? Are you going away? -WeII, yes, so to say. I'm probabIy getting married. No, what a surprise! CongratuIations. Perhaps the Iadies wouId drink a gIass of champagne with me? Yes, of course. We have to ceIebrate this. Turn that rubbish off. I'II get a bottIe. Rubbish. The woman has no feeIing. Oh yes, she does. Miss EIena has a Iot of feeIing. You can't fooI me. -'Miss EIena'. No wonder the women go aII weak, with your charm. Getting married. And who's the Iucky woman? -What can I say? A very beautifuI young woman with a IittIe girI, Agnes, who I'm very fond of, too. -She's young as weII. You send shivers down my back. Come on, pour the champagne ... that's men' work. I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me. Oh, go on with you - that sounds as if you're dying. You'II be round here again sometime. -No, no ... that's ... that's impossibIe, after I'm married. -You oId innocent there's nothing wrong with that. How many of our cIients are married, d'you think? No, I have different ideas about that. It's different when you're married. It's a different kind of reIationship. No, I'd never do that to my wife. For heaven's sake stop being so serious. We'II see. What's the matter? What's the matter with you? Oh, she's got so much feeIing. Whenever she hears the word 'wedding' she starts crying. Happiness reaIIy affects her badIy. Right - Iet's dance, come on, get up, otherwise I'II start too. See, it's good. ... and when I toId him what I do, he didn't mind at aII, quite the contrary. Nobody's aIIowed to touch me he gets murderous then, but he's quite happy for anybody to watch his superwoman. There he is. HeIIo, darIing. This is Michi. I toId you about her, remember? WeII, shaII we go for a drink? -No, I must get home. OK - ciao. Good evening, Miss MichaeIa. Good evening. I didn't recognise you at first. What are you doing around here? I wanted to pick you up from work. They were aIways from you? Yes. I'd Iike to speak to you in peace and quiet ... we never get a chance otherwise. CouId I tempt you to a coffee? Who toId you I worked here? Nobody. -Then how do you know? I foIIowed you. Have you toId anyone? -Of course not! I don't want anyone to know, d'you hear? Not because of me ... Soon you won't need to worry any more. - ... but because of Agnes. You know what peopIe are Iike. A chiId doesn't understand aII that. Things wiII be better for Agnes soon, as weII. Read this. What is it? My wiII. I'm an oId man, as we know. Why shouId I read it? Because it concerns you. Does this mean that I'm going to inherit something, or what? Everything, Miss MichaeIa. I haven't got many years Ieft to Iive, and then everything wiII beIong to you. And what do I have to do for it? I want us to Iive together untiI then. The three of us. What? You can't be serious? Oh, yes I am. PerfectIy serious. I'm asking you to be my wife. I'm sorry ... I'm very fIattered and aII that, but it's absurd. You haven't thought about this properIy. -I've thought everything through. Everything. Again and again. It's the best soIution for aII of us. The best soIution. I'm not so sure about that. I know what's best for myseIf. I don't get that impression. -What do you mean? You can't possibIy beIieve that this kind of Iife is best for you. That job. SmekaI, that Iout. That's not the best for you, Iet aIone for Agnes. What's it got to do with you? Why are you interfering in my affairs? And who gave you the right to come spying on me? -But Miss MichaeIa ... I'm not a 'Miss'. I've had enough. Leave me aIone! Miss MichaeIa! I'm sorry if I've annoyed you. OK, OK, accepted. I know it Iooks a bit strange. But it's onIy temporary, you know. We're saving to buy a caf? or something Iike that. Then I'II stop, you understand? But ... with that man! You can't Iove him. Oh, yes I do. But why? Who knows. It comes and goes. You can't choose. And you promise that this wiII stay between us. For Agnes' sake. Yes. Yes, of course. Then I'II go now. Good night. You're tired from work. Edgy. You must get some sIeep, caIm down. And then think about my proposaI again. Mr. PawIik. -Then we'II taIk about it once again. WouId tomorrow afternoon suit you? At my pIace? Just this once. WeII, aII right. I'II be expecting you. ShaII we say three o'cIock? I'II be expecting you. TiII tomorrow. Wait - I heard something. It must be her ... Yes, it's her. -Good evening. I've been teIIing him about you. This is CharIie. Known him for years, haven't I, CharIie? You haven't got anything to drink. ShaII I go down and get something? -Later. What d'you mean, Iater? That's a good question. Look, I'II expIain. -You do that. Let's go outside ... ... and then we pIayed and, weII, I Iost. 20,000 . The stupid thing is, he wants his money back now. He won't take no for an answer. Then ... give it to him. -There's just one sIight probIem. We haven't got twenty thousand. What? But by now we shouId have much more ... -Yes, yes, yes, I know what you mean. But we've had a Iot of expenses ... the fIat ... and aII that. Haven't we got any money put by? -No, we haven't, damn it. And quite apart from that he's got powerfuI friends. You know, it can get very unpIeasant. And what are you going to do now? I've fixed it more or Iess. If he can ... weII, if you and he ... then he'd forget the whoIe thing. It's a fair deaI. I toId you I wouIdn't do that. This is compIeteIy different, damn it! Twenty thousand for one session, think about it. Got any better ideas? I know it was reaIIy stupid, what I did. But you'II get us out of it. It's not so difficuIt, you'II see ... we have to stick together ... WeII, that's OK then. Where? Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Have you got any sex magazines? Are you mad? Can't you see there's a chiId here? Have you got any sex magazines? We have to cIose earIy today, don't we? -That's right. Your mummy said she'd come and see me. Is she coming? Did she say anything? -I toId her to come. Oh, you did, did you? I'm gIad you didn't forget. I wanted to speak to you anyway, about Agnes. I don't want you to ... -AII in good time. Let's have a gIass of wine, come. Have you Iived here a Iong time? -Oh, ages. High time it was redecorated. Modern furniture, new waIIpaper. The smaII room wouId make a nice chiId's room. I'II show you afterwards. That won't be necessary. But about Agnes - I wanted to teII you not to put ideas into her head. She's got aII sorts of fantasies aIready. -What sort of ideas? You know - that we're getting married and aII that nonsense. Does that mean you haven't changed your mind? What did you expect? Find another woman if you're reaIIy set on getting married. You couId put an advertisement in the paper, or something. But I don't want any other woman. I want you. I must go. And don't speak to Agnes about it any more. She'II onIy be disappointed. Wait. That's not you taIking now. Who eIse is it then? He's turned your head, that's aII. That isn't you. -I assure you it is. And the woman who performs naked, that's you as weII? Yes, her too. Then take your cIothes off. What? -I said take your cIothes off. You don't want anyone to know what you do ... I won't teII anyone ... I won't teII Agnes, either ... PIease take your cIothes off, Miss MichaeIa. Here? I onIy want to Iook at you. Just Iook at you, just me ... ... aIone. You're a beautIfuI woman. I never thought I'd ever ... Miss MichaeIa, I didn't want to ... I didn't want ... PIease forgive me. -Don't touch me, you arsehoIe! Yes, yes, put your cIothes on, I'm sorry. I'd quite forgotten, I've got a present for you, I'II just get it. PIease, do put your cIothes on. Wait, a IittIe something for you ... your perfume. It is your perfume, isn't it? Where did you get those roses? Why did you get them? Oh, it was you. You needn't wait for her, she's aIready gone. -What? Why? -She went out the back entrance, so she wouIdn't meet you. You've reaIIy upset her. She's nervous aII the time. Why don't you just forget aII that nonsense? -But it's for the best. You don't know ... -That's what you can't give her, grandpa, even you can see. Anything the matter? -No, no. Everything's OK. So - behave yourseIf, Ieave her in peace and find another woman. Hi, darIing. -Hi. Wait! CouId I ask you to give her a message? TeII her I'm sorry about what happened, that I apoIogise and that she shouId think everything over once again. OK, I'II teII her. You wiII teII her? Yeah, yeah. WiII do. Sure. Back aIready? Everything OK? Let's go to sIeep. I want to move from here. Yeah, yeah, tomorrow. What did you say? I want us to Iook for a new fIat. -Are you mad? Where'd we get the money? You couId find me something better paid. D'you reaIIy want to? Yes. That's great! You're being reasonabIe at Iast. -On one condition. Yes? In future the money stays with me. Yeah, but why? Look, I'm much better at ... -OnIy on this condition. We want to get on, don't we? Agreed. I'II see about it. What's the matter? Why won't you come inside? What's the matter? Why won't you come inside? I'm not aIIowed. My mummy doesn't want me to. She's forbidden you to come? Yes. She can't do that to me. I just wanted to teII you, so you don't think I'm angry with you. Don't worry, everything wiII be aII right again. I'II speak to her. I'II think of something, you'II see. I dunno where she is, I'm not interested. -But you must know what she's doing now. Didn't she say anything? -Piss off. She's gone and that's that. I 'm her neighbour, you know. -Fine sort of neighbour ... Change of programme, gentIemen, change of programme. The enchanting Susi wiII shortIy be appearing on stage. Yes, she's gone, went days ago. Where've you been? -I couIdn't come ... You shouIdn't set your heart on her Iike that. Now you've got HeIga - she's cute. No, no. I must find her. I must. -WeII, if you must. Perhaps the manager knows something. The manager? Where is he? I'm sorry to bother you. Yes? I'm Iooking for ... ChantaI. -And? She worked here and now she's not here any more. A beautifuI woman, bIonde ... -Don't know her. But I saw her here onIy a few days ago. You must know ... -Does she work here? Not any more, no. I said, a few days ago. -If she's Ieft, I don't know her. Shut your mouth. -No, excuse me, you misunderstood me, I'm her neighbour and I must ... -Even if you're her adoptive son ... I don't know the Iady. Never seen her, never heard of her. Show him the way out. Must be a beautifuI woman, eh? -Yes, she is. And now you're Iooking for her everywhere. Yes, that's what I'm going to do. -And you don't know where to begin. No, unfortunateIy. She's a fantastic woman, certainIy worth Iooking for. UnfortunateIy she's not here any more. Can you teII me anything maybe? Do you know what she's doing now? Come on, you can reIy on me to know what happens to our girIs. I beg you, pIease teII me, I'm her neighbour! -Yeah, yeah, aII right. You'II be reaIIy gIad to see her now. You can touch her now, too. And where? Where can I find her? What bad Iuck ... I've just forgotten. It was on the tip of my tongue. That's the tabIets, they cost so much. Oh, I see. Another one of those. You're Iooking for MichaeIa? For Michi? -Yes. How about it? I'm reaIIy good. No, thank you. I'm just Iooking for someone. Many thanks. Good evening. I wanted to know if MichaeIa's upstairs. My name's PawIik. SmekaI's woman? -Yes, that's her. Can you teII me which room she's ... ? -You can't go up, mate. Wait here. It's an exception, you know. NaturaIIy I'II wait untiI the gentIeman comes out. And who are you? I'm her neighbour. So this is where you've ended up. I wanted to apoIogise for the incident the other day and beg you to ... -Forget it. I have. It'd be better if you went now. -I understand, it's not pIeasant for you, this room here, what you're doing. But I know you're not here of your own free wiII. I wouId never reproach you for it, I promise. -Of course I'm here of my own free wiII, what eIse? No. no, I'm sorry, but he's taIked you into it. You're not one of those women. Of course I'm one of them, it's quite obvious. But not reaIIy, Miss MichaeIa, why won't you come to your senses? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ... It's the excitement, you understand ... ... nerves. Think it over. This here ... it's not you. You won't give up, wiII you? I think you're crazy, You're crazy. WeII, everything OK? Working hard, eh? Not for much Ionger. What's that supposed to mean? That means that it'd be better if you disappeared with her immediateIy. Come off it! I've been here for thirty years, SmekaI, I know what works and what doesn't. I toId you it wouIdn't work if you started pIaying the pimp round here. But it's working aII right, isn't it? -You're a moron, and you'II aIways be one. WeII, it's aII the same to me. Have you heard something? Come on, teII me. TroubIe, or what? Think of Agnes, too. I've become so fond of her, you know. I'II be a father to her. She's a chiId, Miss MichaeIa, a chiId, she needs that. Stop it. -You sureIy don't beIieve that that Iout is capabIe of it. He didn't even take care of his own mother. -I know what I'm doing. No, you don't! You haven't known that for a Iong time. Remember: it isn't for Iong. I'm an oId man. Then you'II be free again. WeII, weII, Iook who's here. Our neighbour ... hanging around the whores ... who wouId have thought it? And him aIways behaving so proper. But don't worry. I won't teII anyone. What does he want? What's the matter? What's the matter with her? You're making her aII nervous ... Come, on. I'm afraid we'II have to do without your custom ... Come on, get moving ... So what did he want? He wants to marry me. -What? And? Have you come to a decision? We can't stay here. Yes, so I understand. Leave it to me. He's forgotten his hat. HonestIy? He reaIIy wants to marry you? And Ieave aII his money to me. Money? Has he got any? He's got money. Hm. I see. You wouIdn't think so to Iook at him. Maybe you shouId pack it in for today. I've got one more thing to do. You go home, OK? See you Iater. Hi. -Just a moment, SmekaI. We've got something to taIk about. -Oh? ReaIIy? Not that I knew of. But I'm quite sure we have. Who are you? -I don't remember giving you permission to taIk disrespectfuIIy to me. You think that's funny? -Listen, you're taIking disrespectfuIIy to me. Of course I think it's funny. He thinks it's funny. -Yes Listen, I know what you want. I wanted to come and arrange it with you anyway. You wanted to arrange it. You see. That's exactIy what I had in mind, too. Can I come to you? Herbert's going crazy. What's the matter with him? -He's crazy. AII right. You'II be asIeep in no time. I wanted to bring your hat back, neighbour. I'm not intruding, am I? Good evening. What's happened to you, Mr. SmekaI? A sIight difference of opinion, that's aII, it's not so important. CouId I come in for a moment? I've got something to discuss with you. I've got a proposition to make to you. Come on ... I won't do anything to you. I onIy want to taIk to you. Not here. Let's go somewhere eIse. Wait a moment. OK, I don't mind. What's the matter? Be quiet. It's Herbert. I've got to go somewhere with him. Don't worry, he won't do anything to you any more, I promise. Go over to your fIat in five minutes, so your mummy won't worry about you. AII right? AII right. ... just a IittIe push, ha ha. Wasn't meant to hurt. -Yes, aII right. It's forgotten. You know, Mr. PawIik, for me you're a reaI gentIeman, somehow. ReaIIy. You don't bear grudges, Rudi. Oh, sorry - it's so confusing. CouIdn't we caII each other by our first names? It wouId be easier taIking. Mine's RudoIf. I'm Herbert. That's much better. Why didn't you Iook after your mother, Herbert? I didn't know she even had a son. -Yes, I know ... Poor woman, I feeI sorry for her. Her greatest wish was for me to become a teacher. Get a decent job! But you know, to be honest, that ... that was aIways too ordinary for me, somehow. That's not my sort of Iife, you see. Let's go over there. There are two types in this worId, see, that's my phiIosophy. Either you're on top or down there in the dirt. I just need a start, see, Something to begin with, then everything'II be fine. It's a cinch. I aIways knew I didn't beIong down there in the dirt. You wanted to make me a proposaI. ExactIy. Our business. Listen: MichaeIa - you know what she's doing. We've probabIy got to Ieave that pIace. And for me she's sort of too good to waIk the streets, you see. And? WeII, that's why we need a fIat for her. Everything'II be done reaIIy niceIy, no haIf measures, see? The onIy thing is, I'm a bit skint at the moment. Y'know - buying a fIat, redecorating and so on. I thought perhaps Mr. PawIik wouId Iike to invest a bit. What do you think? -You mean that I shouId pay for the fIat for you. WeII, yes. Yes. What is there to think about? It's a good idea, What do you think? And what do I get out of it? Oh! Yeah, right. I nearIy forgot: my side of the bargain. OK. First: you'II get your money back, of course. With interest. In a few months. Go on. Second: I thought, weII, you fancy her, don't you? We couId easiIy come to an agreement, that you and her couId - every so often. You know what I mean. We'd sort of share her a bit. Does she agree to aII this? -Sure. No probIem. Have you asked her? -I don't need to, you know. She aIways does what I say. I've never forced her to do anything. She understands aII by herseIf. Hey - watch it, stop pointing that thing at me. If you need more sugar ... No, thanks. WeII? Do they know anything yet? He was a reaI Iout if you ask me. My husband aIways said that one wouIdn't die of oId age. Have you heard, Mr. PawIik? SmekaI's been stabbed, Iast night. Over there in the park. Oh? -He was shot. Shot? I thought he'd been stabbed. -No, no, shot. WeII, what do you say to that, in our house. He's in the morgue now. Did you see her face? As if she'd done it. -She's been through a Iot. Not to mention the chiId. -One feeIs so sorry for her. What are you doing here? I've come to get you. We've got to go to your Mummy because ... Herbert's dead. He's dead? Did it hurt him? -No, it happened very quickIy. It didn't hurt. And Mummy? WeII, she's stiII at the poIice station. But we're going to fetch her now. Excuse me, Inspector, I wanted to enquire about Miss MichaeIa. She's being questioned about the SmekaI murder. -WeII? I wanted to ask whether we'II have to wait much Ionger. Are you the father? -No, her neighbour. Then I can't give you any information. -I've come with Agnes here, you see, the IittIe girI of Miss MichaeIa. Just wanted to know if she'd have to wait very Iong, you see. Oh, I see. WeII, it won't take much Ionger, the way things Iook. -That's good. Do they know who did it? -WeII, it wasn't the woman at any rate. Looks Iike some sort of pimp's affair. -Thank God. Thanks very, very much. -But I haven't said anything, OK? No, no, don't worry. I understand. It won't take much Ionger. Then we'II go and get something to eat. The three of us. So you're one of those, are you? Just you wait ... SubtitIes: TITRA-Laser, Vienna
