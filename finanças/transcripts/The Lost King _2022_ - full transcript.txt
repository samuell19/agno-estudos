- Hi, hon! - Hey. Thank you. - This is it then. - Hmm. - Nervous? - A bit. You'll be all right. First in every morning, last out. How are my panda eyes? They're fine. Bad night? Er, no, this is actually me after a good night's sleep. I value each and every member of my team and I let head office know this. But the new management have pushed for a list of six of you for the super team. So, the names I've put forward are Brodie... - Jamie. - Yes! - Laura. - Brilliant! - Andy. - Right! - Daniel. - Yeah! And, er... - Kirsty. - Oh. So congratulations to those six. Let's have a few minutes to digest everything and then back to work. I can't believe it. - Not now. - Yeah. - No. - Yeah, now. Kirsty? She hasn't been here five minutes! I think you're very competent and valued, Philippa. But after careful consideration, I have decided that you are at the right level for you. Are you actually reading from an hr manual? No, no. Look, we both know you've had issues. Me isn't skiving. I suffer from chronic fatigue, Tony. It's a real illness. And yet have I ever missed a deadline? I thought it was time to give the younger ones a chance to shine. Well, if you want people who are good at being under 40, I will admit I am struggling there. But so are you. Hair wax isn't fooling anyone. It's Clay, actually. I can't face it. What would improve things for you? A penis. Well, you can have mine. It's not very busy these days. Trying to make me laugh isn't helping much, John. I just keep getting horrible flashbacks to when I was ill. Yeah, don't do anything impetuous. That's all I ask. We have two households to run and we need your wages too. Boys! Wait a minute, are you not eating with us too? No. I'm, er, going out for dinner with a woman. Tomato sauce and salad. Yes, I met her on plenty of fish. No, I don't know much about her. John, please, can't you rearrange? I can't face having to go to this play tonight. Not on my own. Boys, come on now! Yes, I could, but I'm not going to. And one day, you'll thank me for it. Oh. You wearing that jacket, are you? Yes, I am. Good luck, biggles. - My guy's going down. - My blues are terrible. - Boys! - Deploy my troops! Dinner is served. - Mum, what are you doing? - Mum? - What are you doing? - You're not listening to me. You're coming to the theatre. You're going round your grandma's. Come on. Max, it's not me that has to write that essay. - Quicker. - Crazy woman. - Er, thank you! I wonder why. - You're a crazy woman. Don't copy your brother, raife. Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York. And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried. But I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty, I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, cheated of feature by dissembling nature, deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time into this breathing world, scarce half made up, and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them, why, I... In this weak piping time of peace... Have no delight to pass away the time, unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity. Therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, I am determined to prove a villain. Can we just stay here, please? Look, I know it's tough when you start a new school, Max, but you've got to make an effort, darling. Just talk about the play, yeah? Come on. Hello. I'm Philippa, Max's mum. - Oh, hi. - Hi. - Alex, Lucy's father. - How do you do? - Hey. - And this is my wife, Susan. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - We were just trying to tot up how many more the wicked bugger's got to murder before he gets his sticky mitts on the crown. I actually felt quite sorry for him. - Because of his hump? - Oh, no. It was, erm, all that stuff about him feeling so ugly, he couldn't look at himself in the mirror. Still, it's not real, is it? It's just a play. Yeah, but it's a historical play. Shakespeare was writing about what was to him recent history. Well, I just don't believe someone would be that wicked because of a disability. Doesn't ring true to me. And that's your critique of Shakespeare, is it? "Doesn't ring true"? Well, see how you feel about him after he murders his two little nephews in the second half. I wish the bastards dead and I would have it suddenly perform'd. What sayest thou? Speak suddenly, be brief. Your grace may do your pleasure. Hmm. Be happy then, for it is done, my lord. I think there be six richmonds in the field. Five have I slain today instead of him. A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse! God and your arms be praised, victorious friends. The day is ours. The bloody dog is dead. Sorry. Excuse us. Come on, Lucy! Mum, what are you doing? Mum! Hello, Philippa. Richard III died in 1485. Shakespeare didn't write his play until around 1593. Sorry, I'm not following you. You said Shakespeare was writing about recent history. He wasn't. He wrote it over a hundred years after Richard's death. All right. And they reckon he probably made it up that he was a hunchback. But it's just a play, isn't it? That's what I said. Ok. Bye. Max, come on. I just don't like it when people put others down for no reason. So, your dad's got a new girlfriend then? Her name's Sarah and she likes seafood, so dad's taking her to a fish restaurant. He'll have the steak. If it's a call, introduce yourself. If it's a man, I talk about the footy. But throughout all your conversations, remember, put on a happy face, and smile. It's on the phone, Tony. Well, your voice can still have a smile in it. "Hello. And how are you today?" Thank you, Kirsty. Yes. You don't have to see a smile to know that it's there. Very important. Please, continue. If it's a new client, say something to disarm them. "Sorry, I've been a bit hectic today." Or if it's towards the end of the week, tell them about how much you're looking forward to... If they're an existing client, do make sure that you offer them new opportunities or alternative campaign strategies. That's good, but you don't want to get trapped. So, what you need is an... Exit strategy. - Come on. Quick, quick, quick. - Morning, boys. - Quick, quick, quicker. - Quick as you like. - Gym bag. - Thank you. Ok, mind your head. Don't let the bastards grind you down. - Thanks. - Bye, mum. - Bye, mum. - Bye. Hi, erm, do you have any books on Richard III? - The king? - I know who you mean. Historical books, not Shakespeare, please. We have eight titles. Yes, please. I'll take them. Which ones? All of them. Thank you. Look, I... I know you're some sort of apparition, so... You can just go away and leave me alone. Please. This is private property. What is it you're going to see? - Skyfall. James Bond. - Oh. - Mum? - Yes, darling? Can you actually get a licence to kill? Max says you can. You just get a form from the post office and apply for it. - Like a driving licence. - You can't, can you, mum? - No, he's being daft. - They only cost 15 quid. Max! You sure you don't wanna come? No. I'm gonna put my feet up. Enjoy the film. - See you later. - Bye, mum. Bye, boys. They love to paint him as some kind of monster, devoid of compassion and pity. But I read a contemporary article from the croyland chronicle the other day... Ah, the croyland. That noted and oft-quoted medieval organ. ...About when king Richard lost his only son. "On hearing the news of his death at Nottingham, where they were then residing, you might have seen his father and mother in a state almost bordering on madness "by reason of their sudden grief." And then, a few months later, his own wife dies of tuberculosis. Poor man. Must've been heartbroken. Doesn't sound much like Shakespeare's villain. Thank you. And this is just the circumstantial stuff. We have facts. We have hard evidence to refute every accusation that Richard's detractors would put to us. If we ever get the opportunity. Exactly! But we're shouting into the void - and nobody's listening. - Oh, shut up. Thank you. Because Shakespeare's play is more attractive than the truth. I'm sorry, my name's Philippa. You must be the Richard III society. Correct! Brackets, Edinburgh branch, close brackets. At your... disposal. There's so many people who seem to take such a dim view of him. They do indeed. Well, they can't all be wrong, can they? Have you ever heard gossip about yourself and thought, "how can they say that about me when they don't even know me?" Most of what is written about king Richard is based on tudor history because Henry vii won the battle of bosworth. If you get in quick with the first lie, and repeat it often enough, then it becomes the truth. And Richard wasn't around to defend himself, was he? I'd like to join your society. Oh, hail fellow well met! You must commune with us, Philippa. I'm about to procure a round of hook Norton's old hooky ales. Oh, thanks. I'll just have a ginger beer, please. "If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken" twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build them up "with worn-out tools." I'll get the drinks in. Six pints of old hooky ale, and a ginger beer, please. He's very eloquent. Does he work in a theatre? No. Car phone warehouse. Just till he gets back on his feet again. You sure you want to join this group? You look quite normal. I'm not. So, why are you all interested in Richard III? Everyone has their own reasons, I suppose. But the one thing that binds us ricardians is that we stand united against lies and falsehoods, whether they be peddled on tudor printing presses or on Twitter. - What about you? - Oh. Not quite sure. I'd quite like to pay my respects, though. You know, maybe visit his grave one day. Oh, you'll have a job. There isn't one. Depending on who you talk to, he was either thrown into the river soar or his mortal remains are lost to history. - Hi, mum. - Hey. How was it? - Really good. - Yeah? - M dies at the end. - Oh, great. - Forty people were killed. - Yeah? But James Bond only killed - 17 people. - Right. Which means 23 of them were killed by unlicensed people. Oh. Oh, dear. Er, don't get too comfortable. It's a school night. Remember? Go on, I'll be up in a minute. Goodnight. - Night, Max. - Goodnight. Did you manage to relax? Yeah, it was nice and quiet, really. You went out? Yeah, just to the corner shop. For... tomatoes. Right. I'm away home. - Goodnight. - Night. Mum, you look like a panda. Oh, thanks, darling. Don't go to work today, mum. Stay at home until you feel better. Thanks, sweetheart. Think I will. Look after your brother, all right? I have a condition... Which I have to manage. It's called me and, erm... It flares up when I'm stressed. It's funny, people find out this one thing about you and that's all they can see. But there's more to me than that. I've been trying to work out why you're here. I'm wondering if it's because you're lost. - Hi. - Hi. We think you might be having some sort of breakdown. We think you need to talk to someone. Sorry, is this some kind of intervention? No. You haven't answered our calls, you haven't answered our texts. What have you been doing? And you should know Tony's saying that you left because of your health. He says he's been covering up the extent of your me for years. How can he say that? It's not even true. But you're not there to defend yourself though, are you? Do you know the principle "innocent until proven guilty" was introduced 500 years ago? By Richard III, actually. No. No, neither did I until about two days ago. Excuse me. Where are you going? - Not back to work. - What'll you do, Phil? I don't know. Maybe, erm... have an adventure? Jessica, nice to meet you. Pleased to meet you too, Philippa. Welcome to the king Richard family. You wrote to me about greyfriars church and the king? Yes, nobody now knows where the church is located, but you believe that's where they buried Richard after the battle of bosworth? All the sources suggest he could have been. My guess is he'd be under the choir. It's the part of the church where they buried - all the important people. - Ah, ok. Er, but, you know, you really should have a word with Graham naismith. He's an amateur historian I came across. Lives over there in cornwall. - Mum! - Yes, in here. Hey, love. Did you stay at home all day? No, I wasn't feeling very well. - I'm feeling much better now. - What's for dinner? Erm, I don't know. I haven't... I'll do it in a minute. Can we just order some pizza? Max knows how to do it. Yes, ok. Take my card, it's just there. Don't tell your dad, ok? Where is he, by the way? Entertaining his female suitor. Ah, makes sense. I was talking to Jessica in San Diego and she said you were the man to speak to about Richard's grave. Ah, the holy grail. Well, if you're interested in all that, I can send you a link if you like. Oh, Graham, that'd be... That'd be fantastic, thank you. The key is to find Robert herrick's garden. - Whose? - Robert herrick. He was a former mayor of Leicester who supposedly built a shrine in the grounds of his mansion in the early 1600s to Mark the spot where Richard was buried. Sorry, Graham, I can't help noticing your hair. It looks a lot like Richard III's. Is that deliberate? Yes. Robert herrick was mayor of Leicester in 1593 and I think again in 1605. There's a map somewhere in the city archives which shows where he built his mansion and the layout of the grounds. Graham this is all so useful. Thank you. I really like your hair like that, by the way. It's like I've been sitting here talking to Richard himself. "Naked of all clothing and laid upon horseback with the arms and legs hanging down on both sides, the body of king Richard was brought "to the Abbey of monks franciscans at Leicester." "A miserable spectacle." - Did the boys get off ok? - Er, yeah, fine, fine. You know, I've got a good feeling about today. Do you? Well, I mean, if Tony's sending you on this course then he obviously still thinks highly of you. Yeah, no, I wouldn't get too excited, it's just... And you'll be back by 7:30? I've got to be away by then, 7:45 the latest. Yeah, I know. Don't wanna keep seafood Sarah waiting, do we? Pardon? Ok, bye. As you've probably worked out, I'm not going on a work training day thing. Going to Leicester, for a lecture. About you, actually. In fact, today's all about you. You're quite young, aren't you? Thirty-two. Same age as Alexander the great when he died. I'm... Forty-five. I've been told I could easily pass for 37. Well, some days, I feel like 97. I was reading that you were an advocate for the printing press at a time when it was considered the work of the devil. And those same machines were used to print lies about you. Five hundred years of lies. Upon Edward iv's death, Richard put the king's young sons, his own nephews, in the tower of London. Then he made his move. First he put it about that these boys were illegitimate. Then on June the 26th, he declared himself king Richard III. The classic coup d'etat. And of course, the princes in the tower were never seen or heard of again. - Er... - Oh. Yes? Sorry, but his nephews were illegitimate. Edward iv had already married lady Eleanor Butler, so his marriage to the princes' mother, Elizabeth woodville, was unlawful. Those boys would never have been crowned. They were born out of an illegal marriage. Madam, on the royal family's own website, you will find Richard listed there as a usurper. Then people are being misinformed. There's actually no contemporary evidence to say he murdered the princes. Tyrrell's admission that he killed the boys on Richard's orders? Or the writings of the Italian courtier Mancini. Unsupported tudor propaganda. And wilful misrepresentation of Mancini. Respectively. I strongly feel that he's innocent of their murders. Oh, you "feel" strongly. You have a feeling. A hunch, perhaps? Like Richard? Actually, no one who met him when he was alive said he had a hunchback. The opinions of the greatest historians of the modern age are in almost unanimous agreement that Richard III, who of course met his ignominious end not ten miles away from where we now sit, was a usurper and, all things considered, a pretty unsavoury individual. The evidence is that... That he brought the country the strong leadership it needed after the death of his brother and went on to create a fairer and more just society. Perhaps you might tell us your name? Erm... Philippa... Langley. And you're from? The Richard III society. Oh, the fan club. Well, thank you, Philippa Langley. But you might like to know that the study of history is an academic discipline based upon rigorous and dispassionate research so that one might take the evidence and study it and then draw conclusions, rather than the other way round. Now, that's not a feeling, that's a fact. Hmm. Dr ashdown-hill. I've read your book. I was wondering if you'd sign my copy, please. Of course! Well done, by the way, dear. You stood your ground. You pay no attention to him, pompous old queen. - There you go. - Thank you. There's a woman in her 60s living in Canada, and a cabinet maker in clapham who've got more claim to the throne than Henry vii. - Or any of the other tudors. - Pardon? I've just spent the last 18 months tracing the mitochondrial DNA of Richard's sister all the way down to their present-day descendants. I'm about to publish the results. That's amazing! Er, actually, I was wondering if I could ask you something. We'll have to walk and talk. - Of course. - I'm already late. What I wanted to say is that you've so inspired me, I want to try and find greyfriars church. Oh, that's long since gone. No, that disappeared centuries ago. Right. Well, we know it had to be on a main thoroughfare so the friars could beg alms from passers-by, right? And that's to the south of st Martin's church. Now the cathedral, which is to the east - of the old city wall... - Taxi! Yes, that's very impressive. I know what you're really looking for, and, er, it's not an old church. Oh? Well, I wish you the best of luck. Plenty have tried to find him and failed. Gateway house, please. Well, er, do you have any advice? There's a good chance Richard is under a shopping centre, forever entombed in a concrete pile beneath top shop. Right. But when the dissolution occurred, the friaries and monasteries were still regarded as sacred places. People are very superstitious about things like that. So, although they may have rebuilt the surrounding buildings, the site of a church like greyfriars, for instance, was often left undisturbed. So what are you saying? Look for an open space. Ok. Thank you. All right. "From this spot were scattered into the river soar the remains of Richard III." What was that? On the bridge? - I thought it'd be funny. - Well, it wasn't. Sorry, did you just talk? How come you've never spoken before? You've never asked me anything before. Right. Wait, you don't happen to know where you are, do you? - Might help. - Watch out. You were dead. Sorry. - Are you lost? - Sorry? Erm... Excuse me, could you, erm... Could you tell me what that letter represents, please? Just means reserved. It's the social services car park. That bay's reserved for one of the managers. Of course. Reserved. Thanks. Oh. Oh, shit. Shit. Thanks. Shit, shit. Oh, fuck. Sorry. No! No! No, no, no! Oh, no! I'm so sorry. Glass? I'd better not. No, don't want to be ill for, er, work tomorrow, do we? Was Sarah ok? Sarah's fine. Sarah's normal. Tony rang. I know you haven't been in work for the last two weeks. I'm not actually that bothered that you lied to me or selfishly ruined my evening, but what about the boys? I told you we can't afford for you to be out of work. I know, I know. It's none of my business, but were you with someone today? No, absolutely not. Sorry, what do you mean, John? Well, I... you're clearly hiding something from me. I mean, where were you today? - Erm, Leicester. - Leicester? Look, I've had an idea. Now, just listen. It's not as mad as it's... Probably going to sound, but, erm, well, I've been doing a lot of research. All the information I need to find him, well, it's all out there but it's in... Lots of different little pieces scattered all over the place and I... I don't think anybody's brought it all together before, but I... I know I can find him. Who? Richard. Richard who? Sorry, the third. The king? If I can find him, I can give him a voice. I think you need help. John, if you... If you could just understand the way it's made me feel. You know, when I'm in the middle of my research, when I'm thinking about what I can do for him, I... I feel energised. I feel happy. - Do you? - Yes. And this, is that why you wanted me to leave? Because I didn't make you feel energised or happy? - You walked out, John. - It was constructive dismissal. Always looking for something, isn't that what you always used to say about me? Well... well, now I actually am. Richard III. I remember there was a picture in the textbook at school of Richard, and he creeped me out. It's the evil hunchback that killed the princes in the tower. Yes, but he didn't kill his nephews and he wasn't evil. I don't believe he even had a hunchback. That's all stuff the tudors put about to trash his reputation. He was a good man. I'm convinced of it. But nobody's interested. If I can find him, then they would be. What are you talking about? Ok, imagine this. You're Henry vii. You're... you're the new king and you need everyone to hate the king that came before you, Richard. So you'd think that in your first speech to the country, which was recorded in the parliamentary archives, that you might mention the fact that he'd killed those two little princes, wouldn't you? But he doesn't. You're starting to sound slightly mad. He doesn't mention them. Why? Because they must've still been alive. You know, I... I think you might be right. If he didn't kill them and he wasn't a hunchback... Oh, my god, I think I've got it. Of course, the hump. He must've stuffed the princes up the back of his jumper! There, you've cracked it! Hello? Yes, I'd like to speak to, erm, Richard Buckley, please. Archaeological services. Stay wide. Keep your shape. Support the scrum half. I just thought as a Leicester company, you might be interested in sponsoring the search for a king. Hello, er, this is a message from Philippa Langley for Richard Buckley. Think there's a dig that he might be interested in. My phone number is 07... Oh, my god! - Did you see that? - He's fine. Oh, my god, darling, are you ok? Please don't take this the wrong way. No. But even from my perspective, this is starting to look a bit like an unhealthy obsession? I can't believe you just said that. I'm doing this for you. Do you know what people say about you? I'm sure it's not particularly flattering. Do you know who William Shakespeare is? Ok, well, he was a very celebrated writer, and everyone thinks he's amazing and he wrote a play about you. And there's this bit where you're supposedly - talking about yourself. - Go on. "So lame and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as I halt by them." You're so weird, that you even freak out dogs. That's a bit harsh. Thank you for your enquiry, but this is not something we wish to pursue. Unfortunately, we are unable to assist you. This is not the sort of project... Is this a joke? It's getting rather annoying. - The answer is no. - Sadly, no. Unfortunately, your application has been rejected. Your enquiry was not appropriate. The answer is no. As you all know, I've been doing some research into finding king Richard's grave, with the intention of giving him a proper burial with a royal coat of arms on his tomb and restoring him to his rightful place in history. And a "hey, nonny nonny" to you. Well, for personal reasons, I'm going to have to suspend my research indefinitely... This is a travesty! You can't stop now! - I won't allow it! - Keith! If you don't mind me saying, perhaps the kindest thing is to set the girl free. Many a ricardian, and I'm certainly not looking at you, you personally, has wandered down that same path only to discover little more than the calcified remains of his own ambition. What's happened, Philippa? I've been trying to generate interest from possible sponsors, but I haven't had any luck, and I can't get through to a guy called Richard Buckley, a Leicester archaeologist. Philippa, I used to live next door to the lord mayor of Leicester. The current lord mayor. We used to be neighbours. Well, anyway, my mind's made up on this. I could ask him if he'd help. Dad, how heavy is 330 pounds? Hello! Is anyone in there? About two of me. And that's how heavy the Cannon balls are. And they could fire them two miles! Imagine one of those landing on your foot. - Hey. - Hi, mum. - Hi. - Hey. - Found him yet? - Very funny. So, how are you? Psoriasis is back on my elbows. Work's a bit shit, but just trying to make the best of it, like everyone else. Well, almost everyone else. I spoke to awusi, from work. Hmm! And what did she have to say? I should know my place? Start baking cakes? People do like cake. Hmm. John, I... I need to ask you to do something. No. You don't know what it is I'm gonna say. Well, whatever it is, no. I need you to let your flat go and move back in with us. - Are you serious? - Yes. I feel like I'm being cuckolded by a ghost. John, I just... I really need to do this. I'm sorry. It's colossal, isn't it, dad? It is. The thing about mons Meg is it soon became obsolete because it was so heavy, they couldn't move it anywhere. So it wasn't so much a colossal gun in the end as a colossal waste of time. He was talking to you, but really he was saying that to mum. Ok, boys, it's nearly time for the one o'clock gun. - Shall we go? - Yeah. The grass is always greener - for you, Philippa, isn't it? - Hurry up, raife. Other women seem perfectly happy with their lot. I don't think they are. Is, erm, is that the picture you were shown at school? - That one? - Yes. The tudors doctored that painting. Really? It was x-rayed and proved that they retouched it to make him look evil. Look at the thumb. It's been sharpened into a claw. They narrowed his eyes and made his lips thinner and meaner. That is what he really looked like. Normal eyes, normal mouth, normal thumb. See? Yes, but how can you possibly find him on your own? And even if you do, what then? You're trying to make him perfect. He wasn't. None of us is. We always try to demonise people, or sanctify them. You know, we're... You know, we're all in the middle. I mean, I'm sure Mother Teresa left the top off the milk now and then. And, er, I'll bet that genghis Khan occasionally picked up bits of litter. Yeah. Human. Not perfect and not a... Not a demon either. You always do the same thing, Philippa. You pretend to ask me something, but the truth is, you just put a gun against my head. Hi. Er, Philippa Langley here to see mr Buckley, please. And which company are you from? Oh, no. I'm not with a company, but he is expecting me. Cheers. Erm, actually, sorry. You don't... You don't happen to have a knife, do you, at all? You're gonna have to take this meeting on your own, Mathew. I've got too much to do. The bloody thing's been forced on us anyway. Richard, this is Philippa Langley. - Hello. Richard Buckley. - Hello. Erm... This is my deputy, Mathew Morris. Sorry, can I sit down, please? Er, yes, there, of course. Erm... Thank you. Is anything... Anything the matter? So sorry, I've got me and it's a real illness. It... it comes on at times of stress. Would you like a glass of water? Yes, please, that'd be lovely. Thank you. - Would you like to reschedule? - No. Erm, actually, I've... I've... got a cake for you. - Not for me. - Thank you very much. It's, er, lemon drizzle. Your receptionist gave me a knife. Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Pleasure. So you're a friend of the mayor? - No. - Oh, I thought... My friend used to live next door to him, so I sort of... I sort of used him to get to you. - And it worked. - Hmm. - So, er, what is it you wanted? - Thank you. Erm... I've... I've got a archaeological proposal about Richard III that might... I hope would be of interest to you. Ok. I'm planning to raise the funds to pay you, of course. Ok. Do you want me to start talking about it now? Please do. - I want to dig for Richard. - For Richard? Yes. And what is it you want to dig for? Richard. The third. Yes, in connection with Richard III, what is it you're hoping to find? Him. Him. - Him? - Yes. I think I know where he is. I'm really sorry. I think I need some air. Oh, of course. - I'm so sorry. - Let me help you. - Would you mind? - Could you? - Yes, of course. Of course. - There we are. There we go. - Thank you. - That's the way. So, where do you think he is? It's my understanding that his remains were thrown into... He wasn't thrown into the river soar. I read that in your book and that rumour has been since discredited. Well, you may well be right. He may be out there somewhere. But even if we... Even if we can pinpoint where greyfriars once stood, finding him would be virtually impossible. Literally finding a needle in a haystack would be easier. Well, according to the historian John ashdown-hill, the site of greyfriars would probably still be an open space somewhere. So, can you help me? No. - Oh. - I don't look for people. If you go and look for a single thing... He just called me a thing. Please don't call him that. He is a person, not a thing. Ok, I'm just saying, I don't go looking for one specific thing. He just said it again. - You just said it again. - Sorry. Er, the point I'm trying to make is that's not how archaeology works. All right, well, erm... Well, how about we look for a church? The whole church, not just Richard? What can you show us to back up any of what you're saying? Actually, would you mind? Thank you so much. Well, here's the relevant parts of my research. Well, why don't you leave this with me, - and I'll get back to you? - Of course, yes. I've got copies. You can keep that. Thank you. - So, are you feeling better now? - Much. Goodbye, mr Buckley. - Richard. - The third, yes. No. That's my name. Richard. Of course it is. Goodbye, Richard. - Thank you for the cake. - My pleasure. - Bye, Mathew. - Goodbye. - Yes. - Thank you. I'll tell the lord mayor's office that we've met her, duty done, and email her thanks, but no, thanks. Yep, ok. It's funny. I do enjoy talking to you. If it's to tell me again how ugly I am, I'd, er, rather you didn't bother. There's something I've been meaning to ask you. - The princes in the tower. - Hmm. - Your nephews. - What about them? Well, what... What happened to them? What do you think happened to them? I don't know. Well, lots of people say you killed them or had them killed so you could become king, but... Did you? You're really asking me that? Well, I know Edward also had five daughters. And then there was your older brother George's son. And your sister had seven sons, and they all had claims to the throne. So if you killed one, you'd have to kill them all. And that's what I tell people. No. I... I'm sorry. Please don't go. I'm just trying to understand. I'm sorry. - Hey. - How did it go? Erm, hard to say. Ok, I think. I don't know. It's just, suddenly, it feels like, erm... Well, it's a bit scary because it's... I feel it's the last-chance saloon, you know? How'd it go with, erm, sea... Sarah. Yes, go on, seafood Sarah. I know what you and the boys call her. - Sorry. - Anyway, we split up. Oh, no! Why? Because she bored the bloody pants off me. A bit too normal, then. Every sentence started with, "to tell the truth." Why would she automatically assume I thought she was lying? Nothing else? - She had big feet. - There it is. You know, er, Richard III, he may have been, er, a wise and just leader and I'm sure had he lived longer, he would've avoided all the bloodshed of the reformation and, you know, whatever. But would he have sold his collection of sex pistols memorabilia to help pay for a new kitchen? Oh, yeah, absolutely. All day long. No question. Would he have driven 15 miles, on a Sunday, to a service station to buy his pregnant wife a greggs cheese and onion pasty? No, he would've ridden there. On his white steed. That's what he would have done. Do we really want to go down that path again? - Probably not. - No. - Night, love. - Goodnight. Sleep well. How did it go? "The university faces challenging times." "Profound regret. Blah-di-bloody-blah." They're shutting us down? They've withdrawn their funding. Fuck! I've just ordered new laptops for everyone. We're not shutting down, ok? Instead of working exclusively for the university, we'll just have to find funding from other sources. Mathew, did you send that email to, er, Philippa? The cake lady? Er, no, I don't think I have yet, no. Good. Don't. Arrange another meeting. When I got the call, I was convinced it would be, - "thanks, but no, thanks." - Oh, no, no, no. - Don't be silly. - It's a new era for us. We are available for hire. Ah, there we are. Oh, wow. So, that's st Martin's church. Now the cathedral. That's Robert herrick's garden. We found it in the council archives. I've heard about this map, but I never thought I'd see it. What's that there? Some sort of garden feature. A pagoda? Well, herrick was rumoured to have a king buried in his back garden. A circular feature with four pathways leading to it says, "come and have a look at what I've got." Hmm! It's hard to be precise about where that is, though. Erm, maps from that long ago very often weren't to scale. Right. What about if we just superimpose this over a modern map? No, that won't work because... Well, I don't know why not, actually. Erm, has that been done before, Mathew? - Worth a try, surely? - Hmm. Hmm. So, here is the modern map. And here's the old one. Er, Leicester cathedral was then, erm, at st Martin's. Friar Lane is, er... Oh, still the same, just, er, spelt differently. Now, cank street. Where's cank street? Cank street is now st Martin's. And, er, high street is south gates. Well, if the herrick map is accurate... And to scale. ...Whatever it is in herrick's garden is now right in the middle of the social services car park. It's still an open space. Perhaps we should start looking there. For greyfriars. If we're saying this is about finding the church, then on that basis... I'm in. Thank you. - It won't be cheap. - I'll raise the funds. You need the council to help with that - and with all the permits. - I'll help. I know. I'm Sarah levitt and I'm head of arts and museums for Leicester city council. And now Philippa is here to answer any queries that we may have. Thank you. Philippa. Martin Peters. I run an organisation which promotes leicestershire. - Hi. - What's your funding plan? Well, I wanted to put it out to a number of interested parties, including yourself. Erm, the council, Leicester university. And then hopefully make up any shortfall by pitching it to potential sponsors. Richard Taylor, Leicester uni. Now, we, potentially, might have some funding we could put in. But I'm concerned about your costs. I mean, radar survey of the site. Digging up the car park. Paying for everyone's car parking whilst the dig is being carried out. Reinstating the car park. I mean... what is your budget? Forty, 50k? Thirty-five. And the rest? The thing is, we don't know how long the car park will remain just that, a car park. There are rumours that the site might be sold and redeveloped. And then that chance is gone forever. I... I believe that this is a very important historical site. I've the strongest feeling about this. You see, for me, a feeling is what you get when you sit on a bus seat that's still warm. Supposing, against all the odds, that you do find a body, that you believe to be that of Richard III, how can you possibly prove that it's him? Well, actually... Because it's got all the hallmarks of being a wild-goose chase. If you could just let Philippa answer. Thank you. Actually, erm, the historian John ashdown-hill has traced living descendants of Richard's back through 500 years of the female mitochondrial DNA line. So... a simple DNA test would establish definitively whether any remains were his. Any other questions? No? Thank you, Philippa. If you'd like to wait downstairs, we'll discuss this further. Sure. Thank you. Thank you so much. Now, I'm sure this woman means well, but it's important to acknowledge that she's an amateur. And she has an emotional dynamic which I don't think is very helpful. My concern is for the reputation of the university, should this whole thing become a fiasco. Huh! I mean, Richard III, under a car park. - Hi. - Hi. It's been approved. Congratulations. - What? No! - Yes. - No! - Yes. Oh, and you are also fully funded. Martin Peters from leicestershire promotions has agreed to give you the full 35k. He thinks the publicity would be great for the city, - and I agree. - Oh, my goodness. Oh, thank you so much. Now, can I give you a piece of advice? Of course, yes. Please don't mention your feelings again. Right, yes, of course. - I keep doing that. - Yes. People love to use that as a stick to beat you with. - Especially if you're a woman. - Of course. Thank you so much. This is the equivalent of someone with a homemade rocket saying they're gonna reach the moon. That's how we should look at this. Be hilarious if she actually found him though, wouldn't it? Would it? Be hilarious? - Hello. - She seemed nice. Sarah? Yeah, she is. Very. Erm... I didn't think I was gonna see you again after, you know, the other night. I'm sorry, I... I mean, I know it's a touchy subject. I believe you, by the way. I definitely don't think you did... kill them. Just to clear that up. I thought you were really impressive with those people. Thank you. Exciting, isn't it? I think it's a waste of money. In my experience, you hardly ever get anything definitive from radar surveys. Results from the radar survey. All negative. Well, that can't be right. They didn't spot anything, John. There's no walls, no foundation, no graves. There must've been something there before the car park. There's no way they'll let me go ahead with the dig now. What does Richard say? - Richard? - Hmm. - Why don't you ask his opinion? - He doesn't mean me. - Buckley? - Hmm. Richard Buckley, yes, of course. I did warn you. Yes, I know. I know. But what do we do now? Well, have you spoken to Sarah levitt this morning? No. Why? More bad news, I'm afraid. Leicestershire promotions have pulled out. But that's all our funding. Sarah did say the council will still support you for now, but you're gonna need to raise new finance very quickly. Well, what about Leicester university? Surely with you involved, they can't just ignore me? Leicester university is not a benevolent seat of learning. It's a business. And they've recently dispensed with my services. Oh, Richard, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I... Have faith in your research, Philippa. Have faith in yourself. If you're asking if I'm still in, the answer's yes. Thank you. Thank you, Richard. Yes, bye. Hooray for Richard Buckley. At least he hasn't abandoned us. - What about the funds you need? - I don't know, really. I... suppose I'll have to think of something. The main thing is that they haven't closed us down. Completely. - Dad? - Yes, raife? Mum talks to herself. Well, we all do. Er, a few blisters, but, er... - Well? - He's asking too much for it. What you wanna do is go in at £3,750. Tell him four's your top offer, and settle for £4,250. - Agreed. - Agreed. - Hi, mum. - Mum! - Hello, darlings. - Any luck? Erm, managed to claw back £5,000 from leicestershire promotions. - But that's about it. - Oh, that's... good. Suddenly everyone's got cold feet. - Mum! - I don't quite know what to do. - Yes, darling? - Ok, well, look. Not now. Perhaps it's, you know, an opportunity - to take stock of everything. - What do you mean? Well, you know, I don't plan on spending the rest of my life - sleeping on a sofa. - Mum. - Yes? - Dad's getting a new car! Is he really? Very nice. Perhaps he can drop you right in front of the school now, can't he? Hmm? She hasn't made us any dinner again. - It's disgraceful. - Shut up, raife. Yeah, shut up, raife. Come on, let's go into town, get a bite. - Come on through. - Get out of her hair. Everybody, this is, erm, Annette, Hamish from the society. Max and raife. And this is my, erm... Well, this is John. - Ex-husband. - Yeah. What are you doing? Are you coming, going? We're gonna go into town, get a bite. Quick as you can. We will stay out as long as is humanly possible. Take your time. Come through. If I had two sons, I would make sure they had something to eat before I went looking for Richard III. I'm wondering now if we make a direct appeal to the ricardians to raise some funds for the dig. - A crowd fund. - Yes, exactly that. Er, what do you want to call it? Oh, I couldn't decide between digging the king because it works on two levels. We are actually digging for him and also want people to... "Dig" Richard. Yeah, I-I got that. What's the other title? - Looking for Richard project. - Call it that. Right. Should that be "sudden and unexpected shortfall"? - Hmm. - Ok. That's good. - Happy? - I think so. Certainly better than what I had. - Send? - Yeah. That's it. Three and half thousand society members. If everyone sends in a pound, be a good start, wouldn't it? I'd say. Thank you so much. There are still emails coming in from america, Australia, South Africa, Germany, Canada, Brazil. So, how much has been pledged? Oh, well, the current total is, er... £26,374 and rising. I can't believe it. Our own chairman has donated £5,000 all by himself. - Phil stone? - Yeah. And another £2,000 from an anonymous source. People have been so generous, it's overwhelming. I think it's gonna happen. Can we keep this clear, please? Over here, please. Oh, very patriotic. - Right. - Thank you. - Good luck. - Thank you very much. I'll need it. The train now standing at platform three is the 10:25 service to inverness. Calling at haymarket, falkirk, stirling, dunblane, gleneagles, Perth, dunkeld, pitlochry, Blair atholl... What's wrong? Where's the new car? The boys said you were getting a new car. What? It was you, wasn't it? Two thousand pounds for the appeal. It was the boys' idea. They insisted. You're a good man, John. Hmm. That's fair. Hi, Richard. What's happening? As we discussed, three trenches. Maximum the budget will allow. And in order to give ourselves the best chance of finding one of the walls of greyfriars, I'm gonna cut them north to south. Here. One there. And another one over there. - Trench one will start here. - Ok. And run all the way down this way to round about here. - To about here? - That's right, yeah. Ooh, by the way, I meant to tell you, I signed the exhumation licence. The paperwork arrived at the office this morning. I couldn't remember if you had any comments. I just wanted to get it out of the way. Saves a lot of fannying around. Course, it's not an issue unless we find him. Er, does it matter what end we start at? Er... no. Can we start at this end, do you think? - Any particular reason? - No. - Ok. - Great. - Groovy wellies. - Thanks. Philippa. John! So glad you could make it! - Who's that fellow over there? - What? Oh, that's, erm... That's Richard Taylor. He's from Leicester university. Why? I rather thought you were the driving force behind this dig, but from what I could hear, apparently, it's all down to the university. What? We're very excited about what we might find. Very excited. And so, with the university leading the search, we can say with confidence that if he's out there, we will find him. - Richard. - Ok? - That's great. - Good. - Thank you. - What's going on? Just a little interview for the university website. Erm, Leicester uni isn't leading the search for Richard. I am. You put in a little bit of funding right at the last minute - and that's it. - Come on now, Philippa. - We're all in this together. - Philippa. - Excuse me. - Hm-hmm. Someone getting too big for their fancy boots. What is it? Philippa, we've found some leg bones. - Leg bones? - No feet with them. Just the lower legs sticking out into the trench. Looks like the feet were cut off when they dug down to put in sewage pipes a couple of hundred years ago. What about the rest of the body? Well, if it's a complete burial, it's under there outside the trench. It's almost certain this whole area is outside the church, which is our focus, remember? Probably a friar buried in a little adjoining graveyard. Given the budget constraints we're not gonna waste time and money digging it out, but, er, not a bad start, eh? What's the matter? I'm worried. What about? I won't find you. Or that I will. There seems to be some excitement this morning. Yes, we found the shadow of a stone wall, which could be the cloister wall of greyfriars church in this trench here. And once we work out the geography of the church, we need to find the choir, because that's where they buried important people, apparently. I also believe that the bones we found in trench one could be very significant here. - I'm so fed up. - You're the client, Philippa. You're entitled to ask for whatever you want. They never miss a chance to put me in my place. It's exhausting. Don't let them push you around. I'll try my best. Thanks, John. We're all thinking of you here. Stay strong and chin up, eh? Bye-bye. Bye, love. This looks really promising. I think this trench cuts across the east end of the church. So we are pretty close to the choir here. If we keep working in this direction, - give it another... - Richard. - Can I have a word, please? - Of course. I want to exhume the rest of the remains in trench one, please. Philippa, I've already told you, those are almost certainly the remains of a friar. I don't think there's any doubt about it, Richard. The depth they're buried at, and they're too far west to be in the choir. - I agree. - I want to dig him up, please. I've stuck my neck out for you because till now, I felt your research was sound and thorough. I think it's him. Don't you think you've become fixated on these bones just because they were the first ones we discovered? What if that is part of the choir, hmm? Over there? What if you're wrong and it is him? Myself and all the professionals, the assembled academics all say concentrate here in trench three, but you say, "no, let's concentrate over there," because that's where you think he is. Do you see my problem? I want to exhume the rest of those bones! We can't. We don't have the money to! I've got about £800 left in the fund. Will that cover it? I suppose so. Well, can you just do it then? Please. Jo, dig out the remains in trench one. - Really? - Yes, really. She's paying for it. Let's give her what she wants. I'm going home. I can't bear it. I'm going for a walk. Fancy a brew, Jo? Hello, Jo? Wait. Wait! There's a wound to the skull. It's not visible from the surface, but when you turn it over, you can see a slicing blow that has taken some skull with it. It would have killed him almost instantly. "Killed the boar, shaved his head." That's a Welsh poet's description of the death of Richard from the 15th century. Richard's personal emblem was a boar. It's the body of an adult male, aged somewhere between 20 and 40. Richard was 32. But there's something else. I've just been excavating the spinal column, and if you look at it along here, it's unmistakable. There's an abnormal curvature. Hello. These remains are those of a hunchback. Tudor apologists will have a field day. It doesn't matter. He's perfect. They're calling you from the dig. They're saying to tell you... Trauma to the skull and a curved spine. Of course, it's not certain that this is Richard. There are still DNA tests and so forth to be carried out. But I'm struck peering down at the mortal remains that this is a person, a father, a brother, a son. Philippa, could we have a word with you? Yes, of course. Erm... Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. Hold on, erm... I've really got to take this. I'm sorry, John. Anything to add, sir? It's a testimony to the research... - John? - Hey. I just wondered how everything was going. John, you're not gonna believe this. Where the hell is Buckley? Found him. - Boys. Boys! Boys. - What are you doing? Your mum, your mother's just found Richard III. - Kingfinder! - Yeah! Yes, mum! I knew you could do it! Well done, mum! Listen, I've got to go. - I love you lots, all of you. - Love you too. Very much. He's here. He's here. - Where were you? - I was... busy. Is it definitely him? Well, I don't think there's any doubt. You've bloody missed it all. We're playing catch-up now. Vice chancellor's here. Vice chancellor. - Could you just...? - Oh, yeah. What do you mean, "we"? The university withdrew my funding. It's a very fluid situation. - Mr burgess. - Things can change very rapidly. Are changing very rapidly. Will change. Mr burgess. Philippa! I just can't believe it! He was right where I said he'd be, in trench one. - You went with your feelings? - I did. Oh, god! Thank you! Who's that? Right, that's Bob burgess. He's the vice chancellor. The university have got their big guns here double quick. That's nice. Archaeology department, the university of Leicester. Look, you have no idea the impact that this is gonna have on the city! How he famously promised his kingdom for a horse. But what happened to the body of king Richard III after his defeat at the battle of bosworth has remained a mystery for more than 500 years. Until now. Maybe. They believe they've uncovered the remains of long-lost royalty. He happens to be king Richard III. - Richard. Hi. - Philippa. Hi. Excited? Nervous. So how's it gonna work today? Who says what? Leicester uni have a whole running order worked out. - Did they not consult you? - No. So who's chairing it? - What? - We'd better get inside. Having received the results of the DNA analysis, I now call upon Richard Buckley, the lead archaeologist of this project, to deliver today's astonishing announcement from the university of Leicester. Thank you. The glare of worldwide publicity has not detracted in any way from our intent and purpose to conduct world-class research on our discovery, which is a hallmark of the university of Leicester. Ladies and gentlemen, it is the academic conclusion of the university of Leicester that beyond reasonable doubt, the individual exhumed at greyfriars on the 5th of September 2012... Is indeed king Richard III, son of York, the last plantagenet king of england. Well done. Well done. Philippa should have been up on that podium with us. Don't go off-piste. The world's press is here. It's about putting you and the university front and centre. At least I've got the good grace to feel guilty. Now, now. Must dash. Philippa. How are you? Sorry about the, er, seating. You haven't responded to my emails. What's happening with the burial? Oh, the tomb? Have you seen the design? Very striking. I'll get them to email it to you. It needs to have a royal coat of arms on it. That's very important. It's a proper acknowledgement of who he was. - A sign of respect. - Yeah. I think this was discussed by the burial committee, and they didn't think that a coat of arms - is the correct protocol here. - Sorry, why not? The committee felt that the physical evidence gathered from the dig, the... Hunch spine and so on, does tend to support the historical view that Richard was a usurper. Richard. Benedict cumberbatch has agreed to do a reading - at the re-internment! - Oh, that is... That's a goal! Benedict cumberbatch. Tell Tom I'll be there in a minute. Yeah. I was tied up all yesterday on what to put on the souvenir bars of the Richard III chocolate. Be shot glasses and bookmarks tomorrow. Welcome to my world. Ok. He was not a usurper. And the diagnosis was scoliosis, curvature of the spine. Not a hunchback. Well, the committee felt that the condition, or whatever its precise label, does suggest that there is more truth to Shakespeare's account of Richard's life than perhaps you and your supporters would like to admit to. So twisted spine equals twisted personality, does it? No, no, no. That's not what the committee is saying. It's... it's... Let's just calm down. He was a legitimate king. And his right to a royal coat of arms on his tomb is unarguable. I will fight you all the way on this, Richard. Well, the decision of the burial rests with the holder of the exhumation licence, which through Richard Buckley, is the university of Leicester. I thought you fired him. We reinstated him. And we've awarded him a doctorate. When did that happen? Quite recently. I specified a royal coat of arms as a condition of his reburial. But Richard Buckley didn't include it on the exhumation licence. Well, that is unfortunate... For you. Sorry. Excuse me. Are you Philippa? Yes. Would you come and give a talk to our school about finding Richard III, please? Oh, that's very flattering. What made you come and ask me? That man over there. He told us that you were the one to talk to. Did he? Well, I'm sure we can arrange something. All I ever wanted was to find you... And show everyone you were always the rightful king. But they're taking you away from me again. Why don't you say what you came here to say? I don't want to let you go. You know the truth. Nothing else matters. Goodbye. Thank you, Philippa. You're welcome. Hmm. I'm surprised to see him here. He must've joined the fan club. - Philippa. - Oh, hi. It's dr Buckley now, is it? Oh, no, that's just for, you know, business cards and stuff. Silly. Are you going to the big banquet later? I made sure you got an invite. I've gotta go and change. I'll save you a place at the top table. I'll see you later. Where's mummy? - I don't know, bubba. - Richard? Erm... no, I'm... I'm Pete. Have we met? I'm so sorry, it's my mistake. - You're an actor, aren't you? - Yes. I saw you play Richard in Edinburgh. Oh, right. Yeah, well, we thought we'd come down - and see him off. - Right. I have to say, you played him beautifully. Oh. Your performance, it really, erm... Stayed with me. Thank you very much. That's... thanks. Where's mummy gone? Erm, I think we better go and find mummy. Er, very nice to meet you. - Philippa. - Philippa. - Say bye. - Bye! - Bye, love! - Have a nice day! You too. Hello. My name is Philippa Langley. And I'm here today to tell you a story about a person who was judged unfairly in life and never given the opportunity to show their true potential. Thank you.
