The images in this film were shot by Eliza Capai during a solo seven-month trip through Africa. The first cut of this film was made possible through crowdfunding. Dear daughter My dear daughter I'm crossing the Atlantic for the first time from Brazil to Africa I'm alone with a backpack, a camera, a microphone, producing some stories. I've never left to go so far. I didn't plan very much; I left without an itinerary. I want to share with you what I've found along the way. I hope you're well when you receive this letter, Daughter. I wonder when that will be. On the plane, I dreamt of an African woman It had been a while since I had dreamt at all. She came over, looked at me, and called to me in a language I didn't understand I said "I was looking for you!" and she said "no, that's not me, but I know where she is" She introduced her family, took me for a walk, ...then vanished. And I stayed there. (in-flight announcements) I've arrived in Cape Verde, and in a few days, I'll be thirty years old. For the first time, I felt this fear. Fear that there won't be enough time to do everything I want to do. I want to give you this letter once you also turn thirty. I wonder if I've managed to wait that long? So, I'll start asking you to present yourself, saying your name and profession. My name is Fatima and my profession is selling clothes and shoes. When I was fourteen I started work as a housekeeper, I earned 60 escudos a month. And then I continued, continued, continued, continued, until I was earning 80 escudos, then 130. And from 130 I went to 200, from 200 to 300, and then I started buying second-hand clothes. That?s when I picked up the taste for selling! Once I started selling I started buying and selling and I started seeing some money. I kept seeing money, and I haven?t stopped since. That?s how I started my life. And I really like my life and my work because everything I wanted, I got. Everything I wanted, I got. Do you have any dreams you still haven't realized? No, I won't tell you the dream I still haven't realized. When I can, when some day, if I can make this dream come true, that I ask to realize every day, I'll reveal it to you. But now I can't. I'm going to follow you. What do you imagine you'll be doing when you're thirty, when you're my age? I'm going to finish my studies so I can have my own work. So I don't have to work in someone else's home Because when my mom works in people?s houses, I feel bad for her. Because she doesn?t have schooling. And that?s why I don?t like to work in people?s houses. Because when I have my own work, when I know it's steady, I won't be here. I?m going to live somewhere else. - What is your name? - Windia. My mom is a teacher, she teaches literacy. I want to be a doctor. Because I like medicine. My dad is a doctor. He takes care of the wounded. He is in Guinea. In Guinea there are no jobs, there?s no way to make a life. I came here when I was eight. I like it here, I like Cape Verde. I like the kids, too. - Why? - Because they play some games we never played in Guinea. I have clothes from Guinea here! This one! In Guinea, we wear long clothes, we don?t wear short clothes. The fairy godmother said "go to the ball and enjoy yourself, but remember that you must return before midnight, ?Because, at the sound of the last chime at midnight, everything will return to how it was? - If a fairy godmother appeared, what would you ask her for? - I would ask for a new house, a beautiful house, with a room of my own, a room for my sister, and a room for my mother. I like to read books, I like to write, I like to recite. - Do you remember a book that you really like to read? - Which one? - The Cinderella book. - Why do you like it? Because I like the character. Windia. It's a good name for a daughter. You could be a Windia. I kept looking at her and thinking of you. What would it be like, If you had been born here? If you had been born in a village with no water? You?d fetch water from the well. Take care of your brother. You seldom see your mom, me. You read a lot, imagined a lot. And your imagination was powerful. Sometimes, you imagined that you were walking to the well and somehow, water appeared at home. You wished for a beautiful dress for your mom and an even more beautiful one appeared. But there was a certain... a certain secret. You didn't really understand how you imagined, and were afraid that your imagination would leave someday, like your dad, who left to live in another country and never returned. From your dad, you kept one or two stories that you would tell yourself in silence every night, before you fell a sleep. Every day you changed one word until one day... I?ve arrived in Morocco. It's my first time in a Muslim country. I asked for some kind of couscous. I didn?t understand the menu very well. Daughter, I was the only woman there. The others were in the street, passing by. Ah, a woman tourist! No, not a tourist. She is from the same planet as Morocco. Fatima and Lalla meet here every evening. They like to look at the sea. No... They like to see God?s house over the sea. Fatima is a virgin, she waits for the day when her mother will show her a picture of her future husband. Assia saw her future husband?s picture when she was 17. Well, they arranged my marriage through family members. We got married and I didn?t like him and I couldn?t even be near him. I would cry all day and night. And I wanted to leave and he wouldn?t let me... Because my mother was abroad, so I couldn?t leave or do anything. So what I did, instead, was to say that when I would take a vacation, I would go visit her then come back. I had to leave to work, and I left and didn?t come back. Until I got the divorce. So I spent three years with friendships, only. No boyfriends. Truthfully, because this story left a mark on me. Because with this marriage I felt like I was being raped. I didn?t feel like I was married to someone who I loved, or liked. I felt like I was being raped at every moment. It was horrible, really. Why am I part of my society? Or why am I part of the African society? Do you feel that you are part of African society? Yes, I feel African. You know, I'm going to give you a very personal answer. Yeah, no, that's the idea Yes. I mean, at a spiritual level... why am I speaking in English? Because I am speaking in English. Pardon! Voila! As to the question of identity, I'll respond in a personal way. I feel African, I feel Arab, and I feel profoundly Mediterranean. I would say that the big reform that would change the life of women is getting over the idea of obedience. by overriding the idea of obedience. Before a woman was obliged to obey her husband as a legal disposition. The fact is a new reciprocal, non unilateral relationship was created The judge is who decides the divorce and polygamy. It is not annulled but controlled. The judge allows the man to have a second or third wife. But now things outside of marriage, these are treated within the penal codes because in Morocco sexual relations outside of marriage are forbidden. It is a penal crime punishable by prison. It?s very easy to say that the person wearing a veil or beard is the intolerant one, the dogmatic one, the one that... Because they are the ones who treat everybody else like infidels, like heretics, that they?re aggressive.. Yes, it?s true! Because to make this judgement is really easy, right? Because it?s visible and they speak openly, even more in the present context, in the fight against terrorism, with all the instability... But intolerance on the other side is exactly the same. All this is to say that intolerance.... The excessive Occidentalism is also a form of intolerance, because it becomes dogma at the moment at which I think that I am right, and that other people should be doing what I?m doing in order to be right, and that they?re not like me, they?re not right, and that I should attack and denigrate any kind of ideology, that?s intolerance. The girls want men who look them in the eyes, and not below! And I think that?s also a message of the veil, to look a woman in the eyes, and not below them. That?s the philosophy, kind of, but it also works with feminist philosophy: to say we?re not only a body. Thank you. You can explain that I'm Brazilian and I'm doing some videos about women... Is there something like... the eyes, the expressions, the things that she..., the clothes, I don't know how to say it in French that makes her feel that she is a Berber, or that she's from this region, something that she feels that is part of this group? I understand, I understand. Would you wear a veil if you lived here? What will Morocco be like when you're my age? If you were Moroccan, you would have divorced Farid. No. If you were Moroccan, you'd be married to Farid. One morning, Farid woke up and found three men beside him. He found it strange, and woke up without making any noise, so they wouldn't wake up. He went to the kitchen, and found you. He was going to ask for tea, but you were faster: "today you do the dishes and get the groceries." Farid thought it best not to say anything. He went off to the market. The streets look like the same except all the women were without veils, and looked right at him. Seeing the women like that startled Farid, who was slow to realize that it was the men who had their heads covered. A little embarrassed, Farid bought a veil, under the punitive eye of the female shopkeeper. He took the groceries home, and fell asleep in the bathroom hoping that this reality would disappear. I?ve arrived in the capital of Mali, 2,000 km from Marrakech. Bus station. The white girl! It's the white girl! I was the only white person on the street. I don't think I've ever been the only white person anywhere. I was embarrassed. I waited three hours for the bus to leave. I arrived in Dogon. It's so dry. And hot. A bunch of little kids all over the place. I couldn't understand who lived where I was staying, which kid belonged to whom. It's because you're filming. You can do all the things you want to do. Because... How are you? How are you? What's your name? What do you like to do? Here they speak Dogon. Can I go with you? Can I go there with you? Yes. I slept on the roof of this room. Hawa sleeps in the room. Hawa teaches at the school. She's the only woman I met who spoke French. She's the homeowner's second wife. - And you live here...? -Yes, she lives on the other side. - If she worked yesterday, then I work today. Tomorrow, then, it?s her turn. It?s like that, little by little. - And where does she live? - Next door. Yes! - And is there a rule for choosing who he?s going to sleep with.. - Uh huh! - How does that work? - Yes! - How... How does that work? - Explain it to me a little. - Well, on the day that you you?ve prepared yourself.. well, that?s the day your husband sleeps with you! Yes! - I have a daughter. Here she is! Her name is Edugon! -She?s adorable! Is there something that makes you think "yes, this is a Dogon woman? I am different from other women because..." You are Brazilian? No, here in Pays Dogon, all the women are the same. What makes us different, for example? - The difference between you and I? - Yes. - You are white and I am black. - Ok. It must be so tiring. Women here work so much So much. So much. It's astonishing. We work a lot here. We have a lot to do. And here, since you have so many tourists that come to the house ... They come because.. the whites come... they come to Pays Dogon because... The whites, they... They come to Pays Dogon, because where you?re from it?s incredible, right? You don?t have any of this there, right? Women don?t work very much. Over there in the city a lot of people speak French, they?re civilized, they go to school and here we have darkness but there?s no darkness in the city, there?s light. At night, everything is lit up. Here we have darkness. He asked me "are you doing this for free or for money?" I told him I didn't know. What? I had never paid for an interview before. I took a walk by myself. I sat down to read the guidebook. It said Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world. And that if you were only going to visit one place, to come here to Dogon, that its history is thousands of years old, its architecture is unique, that the families have polygamous nuclei, and that they practice female circumcision. So I closed the book. I should write a piece on this, daughter. But I can't. I would look at these girls and.... I would look at these girls and.... Everything is all cut up. How does... ... the body react? Do they have the same pleasure... ...that I do? Does it matter here? Too far... I meet the African woman again. She looks at me. I look at her. She and the other women were all mixed up. Watchbands as necklaces. Buttons instead of earrings. I?m taking note of everything and analyzing everything that is wrong. They look at me. They look at everything that is wrong with me. They think my color is strange. Even my texture. My small breasts, my lack of muscle tone, my earrings where my buttons should be, my necklace where my watch should be. I ended up right in the middle of a village party. I didn't understand anything. It was like there were only men there. I felt so sad being there alone. I thought of him, remembered him, who I'd come so far to forget. The guide was two hours late. He came straight from the party. We went to the neighboring village. Lunch. 40 degrees. The guide fell asleep. I don't even really know where I am. Daughter, if you were born here .... There's no fucking way you'd have been born here. You were placed there. At least, you felt like you had been. You went through everything that a girl from there goes through: mutilation, polygamy, all of it. Sometimes you dreamt that you belonged somewhere else. A scar, a scar on your back looked like a sign from a faraway place, a faraway life, and bled every time you saw something wrong. One day, One day, my daughter, your back bled too much. More than you could stand. Wait... I don't want to imagine this anymore. I waited an hour. He didn't wake up. So I left. I needed to talk to someone I needed to listen to someone. Well, I think you don?t behave like we do. You have your behaviors, the men and the women, and you talk to each other. And here, men are on one side and women on the other. - A man can marry more than one woman, right? I would like that... because in my country, that?s not possible. That?s forbidden. - Really? - Yes. If a man is married to two women, he goes to prison. - Oh no!!! - It's true! And I would like to understand this, because for me it?s the same reaction that you just had right now, saying ?What? A man can marry two women? Impossible!!? - No, it?s not possible, it?s not good, and I don?t like it.... - Are you married? - No, no... I?m still not married. - When I?m your age, 30, I'll say: "now I want to get married." - I think marriage would be difficult for me. I came back early from Dogon I couldn't work on the piece I needed to write. I couldn't understand anything. I travelled this week in Pays Dogon. For me it was very hard to understand, Because I encountered polygamy for the first time and female circumcision which I had never seen. And I really hate the arrogance of coming from a different culture and saying: ?this isn?t good", ?this is good"... but it?s hard to understand, right? But with this I can... - Reflect. - Reflect, exactly. I think it?s appropriate that each society produce its own analysis. There is no perfect model for women?s situations. It's true that women have problems in Africa, as they do in Europe, or in Brazil. The situations are different, and I think it's time that women speak for themselves. We can't emancipate women on their behalf. As we can't emancipate Africa without the participation of the Africans themselves. Nowadays, when I see the situation of women, with the crisis... There are a lot of men who lost their jobs. And it?s the women who support their families. It?s the women who paint the houses, who feed the children. But today, even when it?s the woman who earns the money, she doesn?t show it. She gives society the impression that it?s the man who supports the family. Because she?ll also protect the man, who is very fragile these days. And so we don?t find it necessary to make the men even more vulnerable. We don?t work with that logic. With the feminist movement, the women fought, in Europe, for the right to be equal to men. But it?s that... It?s true that they won a lot, the women are emancipated. But the models are different, the societal structure is different. Copying these models from the North we can create a gap between men and women. Because the economic situation doesn?t allow us to approach the problem in the same way. Here, we need solidarity with men. The men and the women are the family. Me, I?m married to a Dutch man. I go to the Netherlands and see so many women alone! And it?s incredible, the solitude of the women there, who work, who spend no time with their children... These are societies that become individualistic, where there aren?t couples anymore. I was born in a country where there aren?t couples anymore. I was born in Brazil. I'm almost thirty. Almost thirty. Once, I gave my soul, I gave my body, my time, all... to a man. A man a man who didn't see me. Every day he came home with a new mask, and a story on his lips which his eyes would betray. I... who loved so much, who wanted so much to be two and eventually three with him, kept transforming each lie into a piece of clay. And swallowing the pieces of clay, one by one, Until I also turned to clay. With one last breath, I escaped. I packed my bags, crossed the sea, and vomited all the clay in the middle of the desert. I had to go so far to get here. I don't want to write this letter to my daughter anymore. I don't have a daughter. No more of this silliness. No more. Travel Diary, Day 25 It's an eleven-hour direct flight from Mali to here in South Africa. I'm beat but I want to finish my work soon. I want to go home. It's almost time. I'm all out of creativity. I came to document a house that treats and houses women with HIV. I meet Patience, the school teacher. In 2001, she weighed 33 kg. Can you tell anything? What did you eat today for breakfast? Just to see if the audio is working. I ate my usual breakfast cereal, Pronutro. Before I came to Sparrow, I didn't know I was HIV positive. So when I came here, that?s when I was taken to the hospital. That's where my diagnosis came from. And I was like, I started to say "But why me?" And that thing kills people, if you say "why me? why not you?" Who would want to be that way? People should stop blaming and pointing fingers: my husband did this, "my wife did that" but face it. That's when I discovered that no, now I have HIV, but I don't want to die. There's a secret behind all this, if you want to keep going. I gave my virus a name. And I always talk to it, and say "you know what? " The virus is Voning. "You know what, Voning? You stay here, inside me. If you react, I'm going to sleep, then you're going to sleep too. We won't go everywhere! We won't go dancing, we won't. go...you know? If you want to enjoy life, just stay there. I'll go everywhere I want to go. You don't want to sleep here and do nothing. You want to go to work with me? You want to go meet people? So behave. That keeps me going. - Fantastic! Fantastic! - Do you go out? Or go dancing? Have boyfriends? How is your social life? - It's very, very natural. I think I live better now, after being diagnosed with HIV, than before, because I know my limits. OK. I know my limits. I've got a boyfriend and the first thing I told him when I met him, when he said "I love you," I said "You don't know what you love. I'm HIV positive." And he said "No" and looked at me ... and I said "Yeah. I don't want to put you in a situation where you... you know?" then he said "OK, then what?" and I said, "I have my principles. If you love me, this is what you are going to do. If you can't stand it, move on." Travel Diary, Day 26. I came to work on a piece about a lesbian soccer team. It's just here, huh? Ok, your name and your position on the team. My name is Matshidiso. I'm on defense. I'm a feminist and and activist. And Germany, here we come! Thank you! Stop just a little, just so I can focus. When did you have a child? I had a child in 2003. And why? I was raped when I was seventeen years old. I was coming back from church. And the guy knows me, knows that I am a soccer player, he comes in the back holding a gun and said, "let's go outside." When we got outside, I met another two. The two raped me. That's why I was pregnant. And I lost the child. Then I was like feeling guilty, that Im the one who made the baby die, and then I just had a friend, a guy friend and then.. we tried. We didn't have like, a relationship. It was just because I wanted a baby. and then I slept with the guy. First time, and the last time. My mother says to me, "are you happy now that you've told us you're a lesbian?" and I said "Yes, I'm happy, and I'm proud, and I know I'll make you proud to be who I am.? Later she said "you may not get married to a man, but you can get married to a woman. If you're happy, I'm happy.? Even my baby girl is very happy. She knows sometimes when I come by with the girls, she says "I have two moms now!" and sometimes she says "oh, yeah, I like that one." I'm happy with my baby girl, to be a lesbian mom. - Thank you so much. - Thanks! Can you go there? Just because we can see all the t-shirts. A little more. More again? You're gonna be a star. I'm going to be famous! Finally! I've been working for this for so long! Travel Diary, Day 27. I met Omagugu at a show. I offered to record a video if she would give me a song to use in the film. What is your dream for when your daughter is our age? I dream that she becomes a strong, successful woman. That she doesn't fear going out there and being herself. I think the most beautiful gift you can give a person is to be yourself, be free, and be who you want to be. And that's what I wish for her. It's almost time to go home. I'll spend the last two days in Capetown. I came to celebrate my birthday here. Thirty. Daughter, today I woke up thinking there will be time. I woke up wanting you to exist some day. I came to celebrate our birthdays here. We're thirty. HERE IS SO FAR
