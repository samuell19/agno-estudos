[THEME MUSIC BEGINS] Sam? Would it inconvenience you... ...if I took a holiday early? Rest up, get some sun. What about one of those pleasant little islands in the Caribbean? Goodbye, Richard. Rachel! Hurry or we'll be late again. It's only 8.30. The ambassador arrives at nine! I'd rather not sweep in at the same time. I just want to get a hanky. Can I help you? Mrs Farrow is out of town for two weeks. No. I'm sorry, Mr Paterson, I have instructions not to give out that information. Do you want her to call you? No. Rachel! Coming! [PLAINTIVE MUSIC] I wish to call Paris, please. 3064353, extension 211. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yes? Good evening, Comrade Sverdlov. Extremely well, thank you. And you, comrade? Are you enjoying your vacation? Well, it is somewhat dull, but certainly restful. If there is no pressing business I shall be back on the 14th, as planned. There is nothing pressing, comrade Sverdlov. But should the situation change I will, of course, call you at once. Thank you, comrade. Good night. [DOOR BURSTS OPEN] General Golitsyn wishes to see you. [MUSIC, CHATTER] How about lunch at the club next week, Richard? Tuesday? I'll drop Rachel off and meet you. I'll have my secretary call you - tomorrow? Bye-bye, my dear. Now, you take good care of her, Richard. She needs someone to stand up for her, he's such a cold-blooded swine. I wish I'd had someone to stand up for me. You never needed anyone. No. Hard as nails. You did that for me, at least. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Madam. Excuse me. Who's that man? MacLeod? He works with Jack Loder. Oh, that frightful man. Getting a wee bit crowded in here. Get rid of this, will you? - Evening, Group Captain. - Good evening. - Mrs Paterson. - Good evening, Mr Loder. - Enjoying yourselves? - Very much. Good, good. I don't like him. Very few do. He wasn't picked for his personality. In the final analysis it's results that count. If you consider our... Excuse me, Colonel, can I have a word? Excuse me, please. All right, Jack, what's on your mind? General Golitsyn arrived without Sverdlov, - And so far Sverdlov hasn't shown up. - I know. He wasn't at the Belgians' last Tuesday either. - I was going to call you tomorrow. - Where is he? He's out of France, on vacation, we assume. Hm. If you gave us more information we might assume something for ourselves. Sorry. It really looks like a vacation, nothing more. - Barbados. - Barbados? They never go anywhere for a holiday except home. He must be up to something. Setting up a rocket base...? The Caribbean could just be a blind. Maybe Sverdlov's been recalled. Unlikely. Maybe Golitsyn's being moved up? No, too old, too rigid. If Sverdlov's pulling out, then his replacement's already here. And we don't know who that is. It's gonna be very pretty, isn't it? I'll bet there is no replacement. Sverdlov's on a holiday. But we're keeping a close check. [RELAXING MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] Good morning. It seems hotter this morning. Yes, I think it is. Perhaps we will have rain. I see clouds over there. Yes, but it never lasts long. You know not to shelter under those trees? Which trees? Those trees there. They have a curious name, I can't pronounce it. But if the rains come and you stand beneath them, the water burns your skin. They're very poisonous, someone should have told you. I haven't given anyone much chance. Yes, you have remained very much to yourself since your arrival. Being neighbours, I couldn't help but notice. I also came here to get away from people. You are English. Yes. Feodor Sverdlov. How do you do? I'm Judith Farrow. [WOMEN LAUGHING AND TALKING] Do you take sugar? Yes, three spoons, please. What do you do at the Embassy? I am a military attache with General Golitsyn. - Milk? - No. Does his name mean anything to you? No, should it? He's been in Paris nearly three years. You said you know Paris. I know someone who works there. I used to go over and stay with friends. I don't mix in Embassy circles. Yes, they're not very exciting. Always the same faces. I would have remembered you, if I'd seen you. Do you work in London? Yes, I'm a personal assistant to a man called Sam Neilson. - He's with the Home Office. - Yes, I know him. - A Russian cigarette? - No, thank you. I promise it isn't drugged. Well, even if it was... I don't smoke. If I go away and leave you in peace, will you have dinner with me? Yes, if you like. It would be very pleasant for me. Eight o'clock? I'll wait for you by the bar. Gentlemen, I have here a comprehensive report... ...on how Colonel Sverdlov has been spending his holiday. So far he has done nothing suspicious. He has been behaving like an ordinary tourist... ...spending a holiday out of season. He's even got himself a girlfriend. She's British. Judith Farrow. Works for Sam Neilson. Bloody hell! What's wrong? Sam Neilson is in a very confidential position. Not enough to involve a man as important as Sverdlov. One of the glamour boys could have been sent to do that. Well... All right, maybe it's just a coincidence. - Exactly. - Yeah, and maybe not. I'm sceptical about coincidences. If Sverdlov has made contact with a British subject... ...then it's my responsibility. All right. But I think it would be imprudent to act... ...as if she was already passing him secrets. Naturally, Colonel. I also suggest it would be imprudent not to consider it possible. Naturally. Pompous bastard. Does he know about Mrs Farrow and Captain Paterson? No. [LAUGHS] I'd like to see his prudent face... ...when he learns Sam Neilson's personal assistant... ...is also shacking up with our gallant air attache. It's a hell of a contact. Oh, aye. For a chance like that... ...the Russians'd bloody swim to Barbados! [VOICE ON TELEVISION] Excuse me, may I have your picture? Thank you. [GUNSHOT AND SCREAMING IN FILM] [VOICE ON TELEVISION] There he goes! [DRAMATIC MUSIC, GUNSHOTS] [SUSPENSEFUL FILM MUSIC] Sorry I'm late. That's OK, I haven't been here long. Had a meeting with the Colonel. - Confidential? - No, no. Nothing your husband won't know all about by tomorrow. Well? You know we talked about Paterson and Mrs Farrow? And she went to Barbados? Apparently, she met Feodor Sverdlov there. They're worried she might be passing on classified information. [FILM MUSIC CONTINUES] Be a sweetie and turn off that bloody television. [QUIET, OMINOUS MUSIC] [TELEPHONE RINGING] - Good morning. - Good morning, Commissioner. Thought I'd bring you up to date on Mrs Farrow and Mr Sverdlov. Oh, nothing very new, they continue to see each other. The last two nights they had dinner together... ...and as usual went for an early-morning swim. But so far she has not invited him into her bed. We made a reservation for him tonight at the Colony Club. And this morning he took her to the Bridgetown Museum. Look at this. A slave on Hayward's plantation, Saint Peter... ...accused of stealing a sheep was hanged from a tamarind tree. He protested his innocence... ...saying the tree would vindicate him. Since then, the tree's seed has taken the shape of a man's head. Isn't that extraordinary? It's just like a man's head. - You believe it? - Well, there's the seed. I wonder what the owners felt like when they saw those seeds appear. You think they were worried? You think they had a conscience? Everyone has a conscience. You don't think so? Would you say I have a conscience? Perhaps not a very big one, but a conscience. Your whole ideology is based on righting a basic wrong. Some people with far too much, others with nothing. Marx? Marx had a conscience? "The expropriators will be expropriated"? Is that what you're saying? In a way. Your conscience knows if you've done something wrong. I know when I have made a mistake; That is not the same. I'm interested in your theories. Perhaps I am converting you to Marxism? Can we visit the Hayward plantation? To look for the tamarind tree? You really believe it exists? I don't know... I'd like to try. I want one of those seeds... ...just to prove something to you. I am Russian, we are the people who invented fairy tales. Mmm, like the existence of God. [HE CHUCKLES] It is a good sign that we have many dialectic disagreements... ...and yet get along. We are proving it is possible to coexist. Perhaps because we're on neutral territory. Too neutral... but I am optimistic. You like me, I can feel it. Are you afraid to make love? [JUDITH'S VOICE] Yes. I've just had one miserable love affair... ...and I don't intend to start another one. Who was he? What did he do to spoil you for me'? His name is Richard Paterson. Captain Paterson? You know him? Only to speak a few words when we meet socially. He's the only man I've been with since my husband died. He was burned in a car accident. I was working hard, getting over it, I kept everybody at a distance. I was quite happy, then someone asked me to Paris for a weekend... ...and I met Richard. So you became lovers? Was he a good lover? Did he please you? Yes. Don't go. Then why did it all end? Oh, he said he and his wife were separated... ...that he was going to ask her for a divorce. As it turned out he never even considered it. She's having a baby soon. So while loving you, he was reconciled to his wife? And in her bed, too. And you can't forgive him for making a fool of you. - I don't want to talk about it. - I'm nearly finished. The worst thing about Captain Paterson is that he is really very dull. I would be much better, because I make you laugh. Did you laugh much with him? No, I suppose I didn't. Much too serious, too intense. I can't take these things as a joke... ...so you wouldn't be better for me. I said nothing about a joke. Laughter is a very serious business. One should be happy in love. Laughter confirms this. Real love cannot exist without laughter. How well do you know him? He never mentioned you. He wouldn't. He doesn't encourage friendships with our people... ...it might hurt his career, like divorcing his wife. Couldn't you tell it was the most important thing for him? Obviously not. That is because you are a sentimentalist. You believe in innocent slaves and miraculous tamarind seeds. Anything else wrong with me? Oh, I didn't say it was wrong. In a woman, I think it is very nice. I have a wife at home. She is a very good judge of everything. She knows exactly what's right, what's wrong. She draws a line: On this side, the Soviet Union and the Party. They are right. On the other side, the capitalist world: Wrong. I am telling you about my wife now... ...so you don't say afterward... ..."You are married, you never told me". There won't be any afterward. No, probably not. I must go back to Paris in a few days. Please don't go. I would like to talk about myself a little bit... ...if you don't mind? You may be asked questions about me when you return. By Whom? Your intelligence people. What will you tell them? To mind their own business. Will you stop trying to hold my hand? - You don't trust me? - No, you said you wanted to talk. Yes, but please let me hold your hand. I am afraid of the darkness. Well, everybody is afraid of something. You came here to run away from your love affair. I came here because... ...well, because I had nothing to run from, you understand? No, what does it mean? I have a good career. My wife is a famous specialist, she is young and nice looking. I belong to a great country and a great socialist movement... ...which one day will be accepted by the whole world. God forbid. How could he if he doesn't exist? Don't interrupt, I am playing at capitalism and counting my assets. I am healthy and I can have women when I want them... ...except for you. But I don't want women, except for you. I don't want to see my wife. I don't feel anything for the socialist revolution any more. What do I do about this? Has this holiday helped at all? Yes. I feel more relaxed. I feel that I would like to stay here indefinitely. With nothing more important to do than spend time with you. Would you like to take a trip to another island tomorrow? I'd like to think about it. Now I really must go in. Thank you for a lovely evening. I am surprised about one thing. Why haven't you suggested I come over to your side? Wouldn't the West want me? Probably. But I doubt it would work for you. No. I believe you are a neutral, you don't want converts. No, and I don't want to be converted either. I very much believe in being free to choose. You know, you have forgotten about the group captain. Isn't that so? Tomorrow, I think I'd like to look for that tamarind tree. All right. What will you say if we don't find it'? What will you say if we do? Good night. - It was a wonderful evening. - My dear. I'll ring you. - Thanks again. - Thank you for coming. - Good night. - Good night. - Bye! - Take care, the two of you. Rachel may not be the brightest thing but she's very sweet. I'm glad you like her, it'll help Richard. Only if he stops playing around with that little piece in London. Come on, Fergus, stop trying to look as if you didn't know. That bloodhound Loder's checked up on him. Who told you that? The children's holidays start in ten days. They'll need more pocket money. Whoever told you about Loder's investigation had no right to. - It was rather naughty. - I want to know who. You'd only make trouble. I'd make sure he never gave away another confidential report. Darling, it wasn't anything important. Just a little affair. Men are always having them. After all, it was a woman he was sleeping with. I've no interest in Paterson's private life. My only interest is in seeing security is held to a maximum. If you go to Loder and start trouble he might find out things about me... ...you wouldn't want him to. - You had thought about that? - Yes. Oh, please yourself. Now, I'm very tired... ...and I'd like a good night's sleep for a change. Good night. I wonder what Loder would do... ...if he found our distinguished minister was queer? How can you even think of such nonsense? Shall I tell you the truth? There was no tamarind tree, there was no innocent slave... ...and no force outside this world giving justice to the weak. There is only man, and his standards are not consistent. One year you're right about something, the next it's a crime. The truth is there are no standards, only expediencies. That's so cynical. What happens if you talk like that at home? It depends. Two years ago it would have caused no comment. But the weathervane turns. That is what ideology is... ...a weathervane subject to the wind of expediency or of whim. An empress of Russia made it high treason to wear pink. Did you know that? It was her favourite colour. Some people in your Western world... ...feel the same about someone with a red tie. None of it makes sense. In a way, that is the glory of materialism. It teaches you to despise everything material. And leaves nothing of value. Survival, that is the only end worth living for. To live because afterward there is nothing... ...no reward and no punishment. I don't believe that. Simplified, it's just absolute selfishness... ...and I don't think that makes anybody happy. You think I am selfish? No, you philosophise one way and act another. Basically, you're a very kind, generous man. Kind and generous to you, perhaps... ...because I hope to get something back. I see. Thanks. You believe me, you are very gullible. Your group captain told you he loved you and you believed him. I say I do something to go to bed with you. We're both liars. How will you survive without telling the difference... ...between one lie and another? I'm really worried about you. I asked you not to mention Richard. It was stupid of me to say anything. It's charming to find an intelligent woman... ...who does stupid things. Tell me, are you as sad about your lover as when we first met? Does it really hurt when I talk about him? No. No, it doesn't. It seems less real here. But I don't want to go back. It will be easier than you expect. You will think of me, not him. You're sure? We will meet in London, if we are very discreet. [LODER'S VOICE] She's booked on a flight due back Friday. She obviously likes him, but... ...if it takes going to bed with her to recruit her... ...so far he hasn't succeeded. It's possible his trip to Barbados is just a coincidence. It's possible. But you don't think very likely? I think it's best to be very careful. Thank you. You know she's Sam Neilson's assistant... ...and Group Captain Paterson's mistress. I thought the affair with Paterson was finished? If comrade Sverdlov persuades her to go over... ...she won't have much trouble starting it up again. You think there's a chance she might go over? Sir... ...my line of business has taught me three things. No one's to be trusted, nothing is to be believed... ...and anyone is capable of doing anything. Three years ago Mrs Farrow lost her husband in a car crash. She was getting over that when she met Group Captain Paterson. Knowing that gallant man, it's not hard to guess what happened... ...and an unhappy young woman took off to Barbados in search of... ...whatever it is young women are in search of. A twice-damaged little plum, ripe to fall into the hands of Sverdlov. My wife knows you've been investigating Paterson and Mrs Farrow. She wouldn't tell me who told her. Oh... Well, I'll have to look into that. It's a man. A leak like that could be dangerous. Oh, yes, yes, of course. Well, you can count on my discretion, sir. Thank you, Mr Loder. Perhaps we could have dinner some evening. Yes, I'd like that very much. - I'll call you. - Right, fine, sir. Thank you, I'll look forward to that. Miserable bitch. There's not many men who'd have told me that. Yeah, I suppose so. I've given him my word I'll handle this discreetly. - Understand? - Of course, aye. Whoever it is that's sleeping with his wife... ...and passing confidential information... ...is liable to find himself in serious trouble if he's not careful. Aye. Who d'you think it is? Watch the road. How long have you known? Not long. I swear I... Tell her you won't be seeing her any more and shut up. Or I'll have your bloody head on a stick, you understand? Yes, sir. [HE SIGHS] Will you meet me in London? I don't know. It's been so simple here and uncomplicated. Can we wait and see how we feel? If I must. Can I take you to the airport? No, thank you. Open it when you are on the plane. All right. Goodbye, dushenka. Goodbye. Thank you. I'm really settled now Rachel's here, too. She loves Paris. Everyone's been so kind to her, especially your wife. Rachel adores her. Margaret's very fond of Rachel. I had some postings myself when Margaret couldn't join me. I got very lonely and rather bored, especially in the evenings. I expect you did, too, when you first arrived. Yes, it was hellish lonely... ...and to be honest things were uncertain between Rachel and me. She didn't want to be uprooted... ...and I cared about this posting too much to give it up. I'm afraid I made rather a fool of myself. I understand you became friendly with a girl in London. May I ask how you know that? I'm afraid not. I can probably guess. A security check was run on me, I should've expected it. I find it as nauseating as you. The idea of spying and playing Peeping Tom on our own staff. But none of us is exempt, if that's any consolation to you. But I've got to say to you, Richard, simply this... ...we don't want any scandal from the Embassy point of view. Your wife is having a baby... ...and the Ambassador is rather strict about that sort of thing. But what's really important, this girl you've been with... ...she's now a security risk. Security? But that's impossible, I don't believe it. Oh, I think that's hardly relevant. I don't believe half the things security say... ...but I have to act accordingly. If you've anything more to do with her, you'll be recalled. I have to have your assurance. Nothing in writing, just your word. Of course! I'll never see her or communicate with her again. We had, in fact, broken off about three weeks ago. Well, I hope this unpleasantness hasn't ruined your game. Excellent. Have it copied out and assembled in the Blue file. Yes, General. I must go. I've an appointment with the Hungarian Ambassador. You will stay here until the prints are ready. I want the file on my desk tomorrow at nine. Yes, General. [LODER'S VOICE] Well, tell us all about Barbados, Mrs Farrow. Nice weather? Yes, marvellous. Meet anyone interesting? You know very well I did, it's why you're here, isn't it? He said you'd come around. Tell us exactly what happened. What's this man's name? You did say "he", didn't you, Mrs Farrow? Feodor Sverdlov. He's a military attache at the Soviet Embassy. Did he make friends with anyone else? No, we spent the time together. As far as I know, he didn't speak to anyone else. Mmm. Sounds as if you got on very well. - I like him very much. - You don't say. You know when we went swimming, when we ate and what. So why don't you just get to the point? The point, Mrs Farrow... ...is you can't expect to pick up a senior Soviet official... ...like Colonel Sverdlov and not set the cat amongst the pigeons. I've done nothing wrong, I met a man at my hotel. I liked his company, he liked mine... You work for a man in a very important position! Sam Neilson deals with a lot of highly confidential stuff. If you think for one minute... You're very attractive, don't misunderstand me... ...but don't you think it's odd? This man choosing you out of the whole island? He couldn't possibly have another motive besides being... ...friendly on a holiday? I know what you're getting at but it's not true. Is he contacting you again? Yes, perhaps, but not to recruit me, as you're inferring. - Did you sleep with him? - How dare you ask me that?! I'll ask you what I bloody well like. You work for one man and you're having it off with another. Yes, we know all about Group Captain Paterson. Did you tell your Russian boyfriend about him? Yes, I did. For Christ's sake, you're a gift to them. Now, you listen to me very carefully, Mrs Farrow. He'll get in touch again... ...and when he does you'll come directly to tell me. You understand that? Immediately! They've baited a big hook to catch you. That means there's something they want... ...that's in your capacity to give them. I'm not saying you'd do it, but they don't play by the rules. It's surprising what you can make a woman do... ...when you've got a hold on her. Like blackmail. I've told you, you're so wrong it's ridiculous. He'd never do anything like that, I, I know him... Do you? I doubt that, Mrs Farrow. I doubt that very much. Well, just forget this little meeting. Go back to work, do whatever you normally do... ...and when he contacts you get in touch with me. You'll do that, won't you? You won't do anything silly... ...like seeing Sverdlov and not telling us? If he tries to involve me in anything, I will tell you at once. But I won't spy on him. You cannot make me. Fair enough. Goodbye, Mrs Farrow. Thanks for talking to me. Oh, and not a word to anyone. Just keep it in the family. - Bye, Mrs Farrow. - Thanks again. She put up quite an argument. Yes, I think we're too late. I think that bastard's got to her already. I wouldn't trust a bloody word she said. Who are you? Anna Skriabina, Comrade Sverdlov. Where is Kalinin? Why are you in his office? He is sick, I am a temporary replacement. I hope you find me satisfactory, comrade. I'll do my best. What is wrong with Kalinin? I don't know, comrade. Do you know where he is? No, comrade. I was only told he was sick. All right. There was a meeting between the Ambassador... ...and the Czechoslovakian charge. I don't see a report. Where is it? It should be there, comrade. There. I am sorry it was not in its proper place. It is not good to make mistakes on your first morning. But as you are temporary, I will overlook it. I will call when I need dictation. - Please bring some tea. - Yes, comrade. Kalinin was showing signs of strain. It was reported by several people... ...that he didn't sleep at night... ...and he was drinking. Did you know that, Colonel? No. I became alarmed in your absence. Knowing he had access to a lot of confidential information. So I decided to have him medically examined. He was diagnosed as physically and emotionally unqualified... ...to continue his work here. So we decided to send him home to recuperate. He was invaluable to me. I feel somewhat responsible. Perhaps I've worked him too hard. That was the doctor's opinion. If you are not satisfied with Anna Skriabina, I can have her replaced. By a man, if you'd prefer. She does very well. It may be I shall keep her permanently. I have seen the reports you compiled during those two weeks. Including that very interesting contribution from Blue. I wonder who recruited Blue? I've heard it said that it was you, comrade. I don't even know his identity. Nobody knows that except Panyushkin. That's the measure of Blue's importance. Nobody else who's worked for us has been so well protected. A very wise precaution. Now, to change the subject but not the object... ...l have had some luck on my trip to Barbados. I have made a very useful contact. I met a woman there. She has a very confidential job at the Home Office in London. I believe I can recruit her. That could be very useful. Is she attractive? Very. Then your task should not be too unpleasant. On the contrary... ...she is as charming as she is beautiful. I am looking forward to our relationship... ...with the greatest of pleasure. Thank you. Would you like a drink? - Yes, I would. - What? Just a glass of white wine, please. And a vodka, please. You look different. Very competent, very efficient. Is that a criticism? No. If I said I prefer you in a bikini is that a criticism? I guess not. Don't you like me in my business suit? I'm not sure. You must give me time to get used to it. I am surprised you're not wearing a red tie. I'm in disguise, I'm a Russian spy. Didn't you realise? You were right about my visitors. I was met at the airport. Oh, lam sorry. Tell me what happened. Well, a man drove me back to my flat... ...and another man did the interrogating, called Mr Loder. He said you'd get in touch and I was to tell him immediately. I see. And have you told him that we are together? No. Did he say anything else? Oh, just the usual about my mixing with Russians... ...my job being confidential. You can imagine. Only too well. Now I will fill in what you decided not to tell me. He said I was a dangerous Soviet agent... ...and that I was only interested because I hoped to recruit you. [HE LAUGHS] You know, it is charming to see a woman blush like that. You must never try to lie to me, I can see straight through you. Like glass. Is that what you think? Do you believe him? Thank you. I wouldn't be here if I did. It's not true, is it? No. What a bad interrogator you would make. You stare into my eyes to see if I am lying. People's eyes can lie. I am telling you the truth. I am not going to seduce you, persuade you or blackmail you... ...into telling me what Mr Neilson says to the Prime Minister... ...although I told my people I would. - You've told your... - Yes. I told them I hoped to recruit you. That way I can meet you without suspicion. I don't know what to do... this is getting so out of proportion. The first thing you must do... ...is inform your intelligence man we have been together... ...otherwise you could be in great trouble. Let me teach you the first lesson about these little games. You must try to tell the truth as long as possible. That way, when times change and you have to lie... ...there's a great chance you will be believed. As you said, I'm a bad liar. Never mind, I'll teach you. I am a great expert. You say the most extraordinary things. Why should I believe you when you boast you can lie like a trooper? Like what? A trooper? Oh, it's just an expression. Besides, I won't lie to anyone. If I choose to see you that's my business. I'll tell them we've seen each other and that I was right. They won't believe you. You'll be followed and watched. Do as I tell you, play their game for them... ...then we can have our evenings together... ...and maybe... a weekend? No weekends. Then we must go to a dark place where I can dance with you. You behave too badly. I don't behave badly. You won't let me. One dance? [BALLAD BEGINS] [WOMAN SINGS] Let's put some music on... ...Some half-forgotten melody... ...The kind that takes you back... ...And helps revive a memory... ...Let's put some music on... ...And reminisce the night away. [MUSIC FADES TO BACKGROUND] Stop thinking about that dull Englishman. How did you know? When I first saw you you had that look on your face. It was... not happy. You have the same look now. I'm sorry. Why don't you become a communist and come back to Russia with me? Offhand, I can think of several reasons. And they are? Your wife, for one. I must admit, that is a consideration. - And red doesn't suit me. - I refuse to believe it. Politically, you see, I'm true blue. True blue? What is that? Ls it a political joke? To some, it's quite serious. It's used to describe the heroes of Victorian novels... ...people very loyal to the Queen and Empire. That's funny. True blue, I must remember that. How do you do? This is Mr Memenov and Miss Mitchell. Mrs Farrow. Please sit down. Mr Memenov is with our Embassy here. His English is not very good. I'm sorry, I only speak little. You don't mind us speaking Russian? Please. Business. Do you speak Russian? No... I can understand a few words. Do you? No. I gather it's very difficult to learn. Yeah. I had a friend who learned French in a month... ...but she lived with a Frenchman. Sounds like a practical system. Well... when I met Dimitri I thought, here's a chance to learn Russian... ...but he had the same idea; He wanted to learn English. You could speak Russian one week and English the next. No, we're both too stubborn for that. We get on pretty well, but we fight a lot. I know some great Russian swear words... ...and "Hello" and "Goodbye", and that kind of thing... ...but six months... no, seven - that's it. - Do you smoke? - No, thank you. I Wish I didn't. Dimitri smokes like a "trubah". Like a what? Oh, that's a chimney. Excuse, goodbye. It has been pleasure. Oh, just remember, if you're considering the system... ...seven months and "trubah". I'll remember. "Trubah", that means... Chimney. Yes. Their problem: He wants to learn English, she wants to learn Russian. I don't think he wants her for talking. She is good at other things, and harmless. We know all about her. She likes presents... ...to show her friends how good she is with men. And how does a good socialist get the money to buy them all? Sounds like capitalism to me. I pay his expenses because he is loyal to me. He does what I tell him. I told him to do something for me now, and I know he will. What is it? He is going back to Russia on Wednesday. I told him to find out about my secretary... ...who was supposedly taken ill while I was in Barbados. He was sent home. You have a male secretary'? They are more efficient than girls. But I have a girl now. I suspect she is a plant. She's there to report on me. Why? I'm not sure yet. There are many things about myself I might tell you someday. And there are many people who don't agree about those things. In any case, I will find out and do what is necessary. Would you like to dance again? No, thank you. I have frightened you. Oh... Would you like me to take you home? Yes. Feodor, listen to me a minute. This is all getting too complicated. I mean, your people watching you and mine going after me. I'm just not prepared to let you think... ...I'm eventually going to sleep with you, because I'm not. You... don't wish to see me again? I think it's better that I don't. [TYRES SCREECH] Hello? I will not try to sleep with you. You can stop crying. I'll be outside your office at lunchtime tomorrow. I'm at the airport. No, I've lost him. Right, right. [LIGHT MUSIC ON RADIO] I find it quite revolting... ...you and that dreadful man lunching together. Has he found out? Has he told you who it is? He's never even mentioned your friend. I'm sure he'll do all he can to protect you. You don't need to worry. I'm not worried; You should be. You'll look the fool. Loder will never involve us in any scandal. Whatever you think he's a decent man. - I know him now, and I like him. - Oh, really? Don't tell me, darling, he's not one of those? Have a nice lunch! Hello? - George'? - Yes'? Don't give me any rubbish about not phoning you at the office. I haven't heard from you in a week. I demand an explanation. I suppose your boss has found out about us? Aye, that's it. So we won't be seeing one another anymore? - Right? - Right. Fine! [SLAMS RECEIVER DOWN] It arrived in the diplomatic bag. It was a personal letter from Igor Tomaroff... ...who was a witness at his wedding. It enclosed official documents... ...notifying him his wife Elena had applied for a divorce. A short time later comrade Sverdlov instructed me... ...to make arrangements for his flight to Moscow on the 25th. Comrade Sverdlov then called Mrs Farrow... ...and made an appointment to meet her this afternoon in London. [JUDITH'S VOICE] Look“. ...If you don't love your wife, and want her to divorce you... ...why are you going back to stop her? My wife is an important woman from an important family. If she divorces me it is politically dangerous for me. I didn't realise you were so ambitious. I like to stay alive. You're joking? A little, but not completely. After Stalin, people stopped talking... ...about annihilating one half of the world to spread communism. There was more freedom, more moderation. I worked for that. I believed in it and I still do. But now a lot of Elena's father's disciples are in power... ...and are trying to change things back to the old ways. Why don't you get out? Why don't you just get off the plane in Europe and disappear? Because I am Russian. And I don't want to be exiled from my country. So I am going on Thursday. I hope to be back in 10 days or less... ...and then I will telephone you. [LODER'S VOICE] How long will the bastard string her along before pulling her in? This whole thing, I don't like the feel of it. It's dirty. You know, I can't help feeling sorry for her. It's dirty all right, but we didn't invent it, did we? The consequences of a thing like this can be big. This morning London phoned, I've to fly back... ...they're in a hell of a flap, it could be for this. Think you'll be gone long? I shouldn't think so. Fly over, get briefed, come back again. Here. My lighter, I seem to have left it at home. She came back to her house at seven. No, no, he wasn't with her. They haven't talked and she's made no phone calls. Looks like she's in for the evening. I should be back in Paris tomorrow. If anything turns up you know where to reach me. Bye. Who is it? - Sandy Mitchell. - Who? "Trubah". Hi. Hello. Please come in. - Sorry to disturb you. - Not at all. I got a call from Dimitri Memenov. Remember Dimitri? Yes. He's in Amsterdam on a trip. He gave me a message for your friend, Colonel Sverdlov. Yes. I was asked to write it down but I've got to burn it. It sounds ridiculous but... Well, I understand, please read it. OK. Kalinin is in the Lubiyanka. They are waiting for you. On no account let them persuade you to return to Russia. That's it. Am I disturbing you? I seem to have lost my lighter. You haven't seen it, have you? I said I'd lost something, I don't suppose you've found it? Looks like a lighter, doesn't it? Even has an inscription from your loving wife. But since I haven't loved you for years and didn't give it... ...to you in the first place I was naturally rather curious. Took me a while to work it out. I tried unscrewing it so it's probably broken... ...so you won't be able to take any more photographs, will you? No. What have you been doing? What have you been photographing? What kind Of filth... It's not filth! You wouldn't understand, wouldn't know an ideal if you saw one. - Ideal? - Ideal. An ideology, for the betterment of humanity, I've believed in it for a long time. Call it filth if you want, treason, anything... Treason! My God, what have you been doing? Who's paying you? Nobody's paying me- The Russians? You pervert! It's not blackmail. I've believed in this since Cambridge. Believed in what...?! I became a communist long before I met you. My God, you... You get out! You get out of my room! [SCREAMING] What else have I got to find out?! - What else?! - Someone might hear! - Yes! Somebody might! - Stop it! You bloody filthy, filthy bloody traitor! You filthy bloody traitor... [BREAKS INTO SOBS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] [FEODOR'S VOICE] Dushenka. Oh, I've been trying to reach you! Can you talk? Yes, but if it's important, be careful. Terribly important! I've had a message from Dimitri Memenov. Careful. It is much to ask, but can you come here? Yes. I'll meet you at the airport. Take the next plane. And be calm. There is nothing so tragic we cannot work it out. Trust me, dushenka. Do you know what that word means? Yes, I asked a translator, it's "darling". I will see you in a few hours. Goodbye, dushenka. See if Loder's on that plane yet. Look happy, you've come to Paris to see your lover. Are we being watched? Of course. What a wonderful surprise. I didn't expect to see you until I got back from Russia. I don't think you would have returned from Russia. Tell me more on the way to the hotel. Hotel? You don't expect me to take you to the Russian Embassy? Mr Loder would never believe you again. The message was... ...Kalinin is in the Lubiyanka, they are waiting for you. On no account let them persuade you to return to Russia. Kalinin is my secretary. Are you sure it was the Lubiyanka? Oh, yes. Lubiyanka's a prison, isn't it? It is an interrogation centre for the KGB. They took Kalinin over there to manufacture evidence against me. By now they must have it. So my old friend writes to persuade me back... ...and my own wife divorces me. You see, I have become corrupted. I have fallen in love with a degenerate capitalist... ...and acquired a taste for Scotch whisky. That alone proves I have lost my Marxist soul. Stop. You're in danger, if you go back you'll be arrested. Hm. I can cancel my trip and rebook for later. I can say I have succeeded in recruiting you... ...and you have a tremendous secret for me. Don't look so sad, they won't get me, I promise you. Yes? Richard, this is Judith. Richard? Wait a minute, let me get to another phone. ...Judy, for God's sake! I'm sorry, Richard... ...but Loder's out of town and only you can help. At the Raphael, 721. I'll be there as soon as I can. You listen to me, Fergus. You've already destroyed part of my life... ...you won't ruin the rest. I remember you telling me about your sordid little boyfriend. Your Cambridge love affair. Well, I put up with that, all that. And now. Now with the children nearly grown. Our future assured, all those boring postings finished... ...in line for a grade-one embassy, now you're going to ruin it all? I could destroy you. Don't think I wouldn't enjoy seeing you... ...go to jail for the rest of your life. I'd enjoy seeing you hang. But I'm tied to you. So, you're not going to say anything about it? I've spent my life helping your career. I want that embassy. For myself, not you. And I'll get it, because you're going to stop this. You'll get caught. I caught you out and that means you're getting careless. It won't be easy, but I promise I'll try. Oh, you'll do better than that. You'll do exactly as I say. By God, one way or another, Fergus, I'll destroy you. - Who is it? - I can't tell. Then you've no right to drag me up here. If it's some bloody clerk... Nothing of the kind. He's in very great danger and wants political asylum. It couldn't wait, I had to call the house. What is it your friend wants? He wants to know whether the British will receive him and not hand him back. I can't answer that on my own authority, I'll have to refer it to the Ambassador. Tell him this man would be a valuable acquisition to Britain. Without his name I can't back that up. What section is he in? Can you tell me that? Military. Hmph. That could mean anything. Why can't you trust me? Look, I know you're a stickler for rules... ...but if you tie this in red tape it'll be too late to help him. I'm not interested in him, I came in case it would help us. There's always the odd unreliable... ...willing to sell himself to the highest bidder because he's in trouble. I never thought I'd want to see that monster Loder... ...but I'd give anything to have him here instead of you. Then I suggest your friend waits till Loder gets back. If you can't help then you put someone with authority on to me. Beyond that you don't have to get involved. Sounds as if you've got yourself into a pretty scruffy mess. No scruffier than the last time. I'll call you tomorrow. He will say to his ambassador... ..."Sir, I have an important Russian officer... ...who wishes to come over to our side". It goes in his record and he is happy. But he won't deal with me himself, and I will be happy... ...because I don't like him. No, neither do I. Which means I am determined not to make the same mistake twice. I am determined about that also. Then take me back to the airport. Well, if we don't spend the night together... ...how am I going to convince General Golitsyn... ...that I am succeeding with you? If we do spend the night together... ...l shall lose my job at the Home Office... ...and then General Golitsyn wouldn't be interested... ...whether you succeeded with me or not. You are a very difficult woman. Tell the General that. If this is what I can expect in the West... ...then I am better off dead. Major, I am entrusting a very delicate matter to you... ...on behalf of General Panyushkin. I am at your disposal. The orders come from Panyushkin himself. I am only following instructions. Pick two men whom you can trust completely. Trust as you would trust yourself, as I trust you. Have them watch Colonel Sverdlov. He is under suspicion from the Presidium. I am sorry to hear that. You will report to me and no one else. Panyushkin has placed this matter in my hands. Sverdlov is due to return to Russia soon. If anything happens to alert Sverdlov before he goes... ...l shall hold you responsible. - Major, you understand? - I understand, General. There's a woman involved with him... ...a Mrs Farrow, she works for Mr Neilson at the Home Office. If Sverdlov succeeds in recruiting her... ...it could be very important for us. You wanted to see me, Mrs Farrow? I hear the Brazilian minister's about to resign. Mm-hm, that's the rumour. I imagine you find that interesting. Not especially. Don't you pick up this gossip so you can tell your friends? No. You're just involved in top-level stuff, I suppose? That's right. I wasn't kidding, if you don't get out of... What'll you do? Turn me in? Ruin us both? I don't think so. All right, Colonel, what do you want? Political asylum. The usual guarantees, lifetime security, but not in England. Canada. Er, could I bother you for a... er... Thank you very much. Just, er, gin and a drop of water. Well, that could present complications, Colonel. You could be a big embarrassment to Anglo-Soviet relations. I'm not coming empty-handed. No? What're you going to bring with you? Always supposing we're prepared to offer you hospitality. One piece of information. One?! What... Thank you. One item, is that what you're offering? Oh, come off it, Colonel. Nobody's gonna wear that. I wouldn't waste my chief's time making the suggestion. He'd just tell you to get stuffed. What do you want, Mr Loder? The names of a dozen expendable agents? The key to a code which would be changed within 24 hours? Or... ...information about who is betraying... ...Western top security methods at this moment? The reason you were called back to London so suddenly. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? Yes. Mr Loder. Hello? What? Oh... Right. The two men who followed you are across the street. I cancelled my trip to Moscow. Golitsyn isn't taking any chances. You think he suspects? I think he believes I need more time to recruit Mrs Farrow... ...but he is cautious. He wants to make sure nothing prevents me returning to Russia. Are you sure you can deliver? I will make, er, what do you call it'? A deposit for the full payment. He has a code name. Blue. I will give you the Blue file when I'm on the plane for Canada. Right. Give us Blue and we'll see you safe for the rest of your life. How d'you want to do it? I will make my arrangements and tell Mrs Farrow. I believe she knows how to contact you. OK, you're on. Now, there's another little problem. It won't help matters if your two friends see me leave. Well. Mrs Farrow and I will take a walk and draw them off. All right? Yes. You look very worried. Really? I can't think why. And you have not been sleeping. I think that you are in love with me. Well, you think wrong. No, I am worried. I haven't had a decent night's sleep since this started... ...but I'd feel that way for anybody I really liked. You will tell me the truth when we get to Barbados. Barbados? I'm taking you there to complete your seduction. I have explained you are a very difficult woman... ...who won't work for us unless I make love to you... ...under the palm trees. But... why Barbados? It's such a small island, anything could happen there. Would I be safer in Paris? Barbados is British, Mr Loder could protect me there. Will you come? Yes, if that helps you, of course I'll come. Can we go back now? I'm sure Loder's gone and I'm very cold. It is important they think I am succeeding with you. That's taking unfair advantage. You knew I wouldn't stop you. You didn't kiss me as if you wanted me to stop. [CHAMBER MUSIC] - I'm all right, really. - Come on, my clear, sit down. There we are, that's it. Put your feet up. You're sure you don't want me to call Dr Alton? It's all right, I'll look after her. Go and tell the Ambassador there's nothing to worry about. I'll get you a glass of water. I've never fainted in my life. You've never been pregnant before. Oh, come on - pregnant ladies often feel faint. No, it isn't that... Here. Come on. Now, what is it? Oh, Mrs Stephenson... ...I'm so miserable I don't know what to do. Well, perhaps it would help if you talk about it? It's Richard... another woman. I just can't trust him. Since that woman rang the other night everything's changed. I never thought he was after other women... ...now I can't think of anything else. She phoned him? In the middle of the night. Said someone in the Russian Embassy wanted to defect. How is she? Oh, she's fine. She's just lying down. What's wrong? I heard something that makes me want to throw up. Make our excuses so we can get out and talk. - What will you do? - Have them stopped. Supposing he's already told them who you are? I'd have been arrested by now. These things take time, it could be weeks. If you don't know who he is, how can you have him stopped? The woman who called Paterson... ...was probably his former mistress, Judith Farrow. The English bitch who's been sleeping with the Russian? Colonel... Feodor Sverdlov. There's nothing I can do until the morning. Why morning? I've just one means of communication... ...and it's only available during the day. Between nine and five. [TRAFFIC ROAR, BUSKING] [EMERGENCY SIREN] Morning, Colonel Sverdlov. Morning, General. [TRAFFIC NOISE, SIREN] Can I get you some tea, coffee? No, thank you. I have come to a crisis with Mrs Farrow. What a pity. I thought she was committed. She will be committed when she brings her first report. But I'm afraid she still has a bridge to cross. One from her side to ours. She's feeling romantic at the moment. I'll have to take a few clays and help her cross that bridge. Well, as I remember, seduction can have its compensations. Another time, perhaps, but I have had to cable my wife... ...asking her to wait again. I understand, it's difficult to choose. I choose my duty. Oh, of course. There is no question which has the first priority. This woman has access to confidential reports... ...about everything Neilson does at the Home Office. She could be one of our most important agents here. Perhaps as important as Blue. If I let her go now to attend to my personal business... ...we could lose her. A few days to convince her she's doing it for love... ...then a controller can look after her for a week or two. Who is to take over in your absence? It might be dangerous to keep her uncontested... ...even for a few days. Do you have a man in mind? What about Gregory Stukalov? I will leave that to you. You and Stukalov are responsible for her while I am away. If she likes Stukalov he can take over from me. But never hurry these things. Oh, patience is needed. I hope you'll be able... ...to persuade Elena Maximova to forget about the divorce. She's a fine woman. It would be a pity to lose her. I don't intend to lose her. Once I have recruited Mrs Farrow I shall be on my way to my wife. If everything goes well I'll see you in a few days. Good luck, comrade. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] I'd like to see file 23, please. No need to sign for it, I'm not taking anything out. Could you get me number 22 as well? Thank you. Good morning, comrade. [TENSE MUSIC BUILDING TO CLIMAX] [TIGER ROARS, TROPICAL BIRD CALLS] We're taking the afternoon plane for Barbados. We'll be staying at the Beach Hotel, St James. He wants to get out as quickly as possible. Can you arrange it? I'll bloody well have to, won't I? Ls that all he said? He'll have the documents with him. All right, I'll get him out of Barbados on the Saturday plane. Tell him there's protection laid on at the hotel... ...but stay there, you understand? Don't take any chances till we come and get you. Yes, I'll tell him. You're not thinking of leaving Barbados with him, are you? That's not on. I'm warning you. He only needs me as an alibi, I've no intention of going to Canada. - Very glad to hear it. - I thought you would be. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Find out if Colonel Sverdlov has left the Embassy. If not, detain him. Under no circumstance allow him to leave the building. According to Blue Sverdlov intends to defect. He has tricked you by using the simplest of intelligence maxims. Remove the pursuer in broad daylight... ...with as many people around as possible. We shall get him in London. You were told to report every word and movement. - But, comrade, I did my... - Get out. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Whoops. Sorry. Over there, sir. Walk straight through, please. [METAL DETECTOR BLEEPS] Just a moment, sir. - What's that? - It looks like a gun to me. - Excuse me. - Just a moment. Oh, er, that's quite all right, sir. [TENSE MUSIC BUILDS] Idiots! Major, one way or another... ...you will stop Colonel Sverdlov... ...before he delivers the Blue file. But what if he's already... He would be a fool to give them it... ...before they fulfilled their part of the agreement. And as it seems all the fools are on my side... ...you may still have time to redeem yourself. Charter a plane, take as many men as you need. Intercept Colonel Sverdlov in Barbados. I take full responsibility for this action. I cannot wait for official sanction from Panyushkin... ...so if you fail, we all fail. Therefore I don't have to point out the consequence... ...of such a possibility. They're both on the island... ...under close security. If everything goes according to plan... ...he'll be in Ottawa Sunday... ...and the Canadian boys can take it from there. Congratulations. Well, normally I hate doing business with his sort... ...but if the Blue file is all he claims... ...it'll be worth it. Blue file? Code name for their top agent here in Paris. I'm almost onto him now, almost onto him. I just hope to hell he doesn't turn out to be British. When will you know? Sverdlov'll hand the file over once he's safe in Canada... ...so I'd think this is Blue's last weekend to enjoy himself. To Blue's last weekend. [DISTANT MUSIC PLAYING] Would you like to swim? Loder said you were not to leave the bungalow. But I am a man and I want you... ...and if I can't have you I must occupy myself... ...to keep my frustration to a minimum. Has it occurred to you I might be slightly frustrated myself? Then come to bed with me. Or come swimming. [SOUND OF WAVES POUNDING SHORE] [GAS PS] [GASPS] Shh. You had a nightmare. [LODER'S VOICE] So far, no record of any private flights to Barbados. One flight plan was filed by a jet charter service... ...five male passengers, destination St Vincent. - That's about 100 miles. - We're checking it out. How are the lovebirds? No problems yet. - Keep your eyes on them. - Right. OK. [MUSIC BUILDS] [LODER'S VOICE] The man who chartered the flight... ...lives in Paris, and he's a big dealer in foreign stamps. The other four men are on the company's board of directors. No one at the jet charter service... ...thought there was anything unusual. Just businessmen off to the Caribbean for a week's fishing. Mm, right. Well, so far it's quiet. Let's hope it stays that way. You know, you never talk about your husband. About your English lover, yes, but not your husband. Why not? I suppose because I feel... guilty. Why guilty? What did you do? It's more what I didn't do. The last two years I didn't love him. Was he unhappy? No, he was very happy, he enjoyed everything he did. He was a most uncomplicated man. Or, that's what I kept telling myself afterwards... ...so he couldn't possibly have realised how little contact we had. Life was just one big party, one big laugh, non-stop. Actually, it was hell on earth after the first year. If he hadn't been killed I would've left him. Well, you won't be allowed to leave me. You are the most persistent man I have ever met. Let me ask you something. How do you feel about all this? Going into exile, running, hiding...? Well, I am Russian, and we believe in Fate. As a matter of fact we invented it, like fairy stories. That way if anything goes wrong, it's never our fault; It is Fate. Lam... not glad I am going with Mr Loder. But I'm glad I'm not in Lubiyanka right now. Many of the people I worked with won't be so lucky. [TELEPHONE RINGS] I would enjoy some more tea. [TENSE MUSIC] All right, thank you. That was Mr MacLeod. He reports the plane will be here on time. We must leave for the airport at noon. - I'm glad. There's your tea. - Thank you. It's him. That end bungalow. The doors are open. Very careless. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Yes? He won't stay in the bungalow, he just won't. He's going out to swim. That's all right, don't worry, we'll look after him. I wish you would join me. And I wish you wouldn't go. In Canada Mr Loder can treat me like a prisoner... ...but not before. Will you wait while I change? Of course. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [HE PUTS ON RECORD] And reminisce the night away... Dushenka?! Yes? Can you hear it? The song we danced to in London. A good omen. [some CONTINUES] Ahh! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES, WOMEN SCREAM] [ENGINE STARTS] "Soviet citizen burned to death." "A Russian tourist registered as F.G. Sverdlov... ...was the victim of a fire on the west coast of Barbados." "Mrs J. Farrow of London was rescued and rushed to hospital." "The cause of the fire is unknown... ...but is thought to be due to an electrical fault." "The bungalow was completely gutted... ...and several surrounding buildings were severely damaged." I suppose you should be congratulated on a job well done. Will you get a bonus? I suggest you curb your aggression until we're out of the woods. What do you mean? The traitor's dead, but did the Blue file die with him? How will you find out? I'm having lunch with Loder. Will the... will the children be down this weekend? They're planning to be. [LODER'S VOICE] No, no... I blame myself entirely. It was a complete balls-up on my part. You see, someone must have tipped them off. What? Oh, yeah, they were all set for him. You mean the fire wasn't an accident? No, there's nothing accidental about napalm, is there? Yeah, bad enough in the open... ...but in a confined space, well, just imagine. - God, how frightful. - Yeah, yeah... He didn't have a chance. And that's not the worst... ...the Blue file burned with him. That's too bad... but what about Mrs Farrow? She's lucky to be alive, she was upstairs. They smashed the window and got her out. I've gotta fly over and see her. I'm not looking forward to that. Well... ...you did your best, it wasn't your fault. No? Of course it wasn't. I wish I could be as sure. - Morning. - Aye. Could you tell me where I'd find Mrs Farrow, please? Urn, she's on the lawn, over there. Thank you, thank you very much. Hello, Mrs Farrow. What do you want? They tell me you've made a great recovery. Going back to England next week. I'm... ...bloody sorry... ...the way things have turned out. Are you? Yes. For what it's worth. It's not worth much. Sorry. He wasn't any good, you know? Go away. I brought something for you. There. Where did you get this? He isn't dead, Mrs Farrow, he's alive. In Canada. After you called and said he wouldn't stay under cover... ...we decided to pull him in. MacLeod went in the back door and got Sverdlov out... ...a split second before the bomb exploded. If you want to see him it'll be arranged. Goodbye, Mrs Farrow. [LUSH, ROMANTIC MUSIC] How is she, OK? From now on I suspect her recovery... ...will be nothing short of spectacular. When we get back I want you to call Mrs Stephenson. Start seeing her again. Find out if she knows that her husband's a... ...a Russian agent. Now that Stephenson thinks he's safe... ...we'll let him continue to operate. Just make sure he only passes on... ...the kind of information we want them to have. And sooner or later the Russians'll twig. Yeah, oh, yeah, undoubtedly. They'll figure him for a double agent and kill him. Saving Her Majesty's Government a great deal of expense... ...and considerable embarrassment. [END THEME MUSIC BEGINS]
