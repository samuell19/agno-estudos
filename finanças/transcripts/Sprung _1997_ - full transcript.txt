And I thought you was clockin' major figures, but obviously, it's all a bunch of bullshit. So what if I'm lying? What's the big deal? The big deal is... I don't waste my time on broke-ass, low-class fools whose game is so weak you had to lie to me just to get some. Weak? You calling me weak? I guess I was strong enough to get your ass, huh? What? Yeah. You ever heard of macks? Huh? Well, you're looking at the mack of the year. No, I got a fax. I'm mack of the decade. And now that I got you, you know what I am now?

I was already deep up in you. Wasn't even worth my trouble. 'Cause you know why? 'Cause your stuff was the worst, sneeziest, dopiest, grumpiest, just sloppiest poo-nanny I ever had. Boy, you're disturbing my sleep. Take it easy, old man. Just put the gun down. You get out of here. Ok. Just take it easy with that gun. Git! I'm gone. Wait a minute. What size is that shirt?

Dropped. All right. Now you get out of here. I'm gitting. I'm gitting. So? What? Was your friend home? Did you get the address? Yes. Yes. 1132 West Holcomb. West Holcomb? West. Why are you tripping? We were right over there when you told me to drive all the way over here. So we went 20 minutes this way for nothing. Now we gotta go 20 minutes back. That's 40 minutes out of my life trying to drive a wannabe photographer who probably can't even develop a damn polaroid! Yo, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on. What's up? Is your g-string too tight, or were you just born evil? No. Seriously, I want to know because it could be a medical emergency. Maybe the elastic has just knotted up your butt cheeks, constricted your blood flow, and cut off the oxygen supply to your brain 'cause you're acting kind of ignorant. Ah-ah. Uh-uh. All I'm saying is look, I appreciate the ride, ok? But you could at least pretend to be civil. Got us going through the tortures of the damned, and our friends are out having fun. Psycho 'ho! Took a perfectly good evening and turned it into a bunch of aggravation. Oh, shit! Look, it's been really, really hard lately, and I guess I have been a little hard on you. A little hard? A little hard? Well, I've just been dealing with a lot of jerks lately, and they would do just this kind of thing to try to make some kind of move. Ya know? I know. I know that nigger. What? That's my boy, Clyde. Take it easy, guy, huh? Come on. Take it easy. His name is Clyde Henderson. What did he do, murder? Rape? Is he a drug dealer? Look, Clyde ain't no common thug, all right? Mm-hmm. Anyhow, Officer, he was driving a yellow Porsche. Right. The pervert in the skivvies. Y.. No! See? I knew it! I knew he was a pervert. They brought him in on lewd and lascivious conduct and indecent exposure. There you have it. There's a woman coming down to identify the suspect. Oh! Adina. Where is Adina? Adina? Adina Jackson? Yes! That's the woman who's coming in to identify the suspect. Oh... Wait a second. That scandalous-looking hoochie is the one that filed the complaint? Excuse me, but Adina's no hoochie. She may not be the girl next door... Oh, you try the freak down the street. I'm trying to tell you, Officer, she's just a.. Officer... I'm here to make an identification. Ok. Let's get this over with. Number one, step forward and read the line. "Girl, I know you want these nuts." Drop your robe, number one. Well? Step back. Number 2, step forward and read the line. "Girl, I know you want these nuts." Number 2, where the hell is your damn robe? They're with my damn nuts. That's where it's at. Stop being an asshole and show your genital region. Show some nuts. I'll show your ass some nuts. We don't want to see that thing. Get his crusty ass out of here. I got the godzilla of nuts. Yeah. Give 'em to your mama. You know, you really need to calm down. Adina's crazy sometimes, but she's not gonna dog Clyde for nothing, assuming that he did nothing. Look, Clyde's crazy all the time, but he ain't no rapist. If he and Adina kicked it, it was mutual. Boy thinks he's that girl thinks she's such a damn player. Such a damn player. Number 3, step forward and read the line. "Girl, I know you want these nuts." He's a foreigner. Ok. Number 3, drop your robe. Ok, Sabu... Get your ass back in line. That's not even his Porsche? That 4-speed, Hyundai XL-Driving.. Hell, no. Hell, no. Oh, why do brothers always have to lie about what they really got? See, it ain't no different than a weave now, 'cause lies is lies. Oh, don't even try it 'cause you know you brothers go for the fake hair. Oh, just like y'all go for the fake Porsche keys and fake bank slips, huh? Mmm, yeah, my girl... Always going for an angle. Sometimes she gets bent out of shape though. Mm, yeah. Clyde thinks he's got more game than Parker Brothers. But I ain't like that. But I ain't like that. That's 2. That's 2. "Girl, I know you want these nuts." Number 4, hate to say this... But take your robe off. Damn. Wasting all that good equipment. Um... Uh, I mean, no... Sir. Ok, number 4. Take your ass back, way the hell back. Number 5, step forward and read the line. (Mumbling) "Girl, I know you want these nuts." Louder. He was much louder. Louder, number 5! Louder! I got to get out of here. Come on, louder! "Girl, I know you want these nuts!" Take off the robe, number 5. Well? I think... Wait! When he did it, he grabbed himself. He grabbed himself? Number 5, grab your dick... And your balls and say the line again. Come on, man. Do it, or I'll get number 4 to help you. Yeah. I know he's willing. Man, get your ass back. "Girl, I know you want these nuts." Mm-mm. Not like that. It was a circular motion. He was rubbing himself in a circular motion like... He was doing something to hisself. In a circular motion? Is that something new? 1999? What is this? Circular motion? Number 5... In a circular motion. I want you to somehow grab your dick... And... And make yourself feel good... And read the line again, like this. Rubbing motion! In a rubbing motion! Like you're doing something to yourself. Say the line now. Man, this ain't right. I'm not doing this. Do it, number 5, or I will arrest your ass for driving without a registration. In a circular motion like this! Put your hand on your peepee and your balls. Y'all got me going crazy in here. Grab your dick and go in a circular motion like this and make yourself feel good, like you're doing something to yourself. And say the line. "Girl, I know you want these... Nuts. Hell, if she don't want them, swing those jingle bells to Denise 'cause I'll ring 'em right. Aw, shut up, number 4. I got enough trouble. Ok... Is that him? That looks just like the guy. So you're saying it's him? No. The guy was much taller. Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Oh, shit. I hope the shit was all that. I hope the shit was good. I hope it was real.. Hey, Montel. That shit's not funny, ok? You're lucky she didn't send your ass to jail. Jail? Oh, it ain't over. I'm still going to jail. I'm gonna get life after I kill that bitch. Girl, you are so crazy! You know what? You're right. He had it coming. He's sleazy, and I know that you are so glad that you ain't give nothing up, huh? Adina? Oh, my god. You.. You did it, didn't you? Ohhh! Ew! Adina! Aah! You're such a 'ho. Stop! Whoa! Don't even go there, Brandy. I'm saying, you know me. You know, I was just being a little charitable tonight. You know I got a soft spot for chocolate. Yeah, the one in between your legs. Ha ha ha ha. You're gonna make me crash. Wait. You nasty. So what happened with you and his ugly-ass friend Montclair, anyway? Nothing happened, and Montel is not ugly. Oh... No, I guess he ain't. Just weak as hell. He's not weak either. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Excuse me. What are you saying, you're sprung? I know you ain't sprung. Are you sprung on that fool? No. No. Good. Remember, girl, all dogs run in packs. Montclair's just gonna follow the lead dog. His boy got some, so now he think he gotta get some, too. He'll be back sniffing around. Just wait and see. Hey, uh, Brandy. Montel. Are you surprised to see me? Actually, no. Somebody said you might stop by. Oh, uh, that's funny. Anyway, I forgot to give you this. A disposable pen? Yeah. Well, you know, when I grabbed the pen out of your car when I went to get my frat brother's address, and, I don't know, I just figured maybe you might need it. A disposable pen? Montel, I'm not living large or anything, but I think I can afford a 29-cent disposable pen. Yeah, well, you know, it's bigger than the pen. It's really the principle of the thing because, you know, it was your pen, and, you know, you should have your pen because it's your pen. And, um, now you have it, and, uh, I guess I should get rolling. Um, I don't want you to think I was trying a rap 'cause I really don't have a rap to speak of. I'm not a rapper. I like it, but I can't do it. So I wasn't.. Is there a bathroom where a brother could relieve hisself? Thank you. Ohh... You have no rap! You are rapless. You have no rap. Nothing! Montel... Could you take my bags.. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um... Ooh. Thank you. Uh, my.. My.. The cap. Cap? M-my pen had a cap. Oh, uh... Ooh. You know, I.. I probably lost the cap. I'm sorry. I just probably..

Hey, listen, man, I gotta ask you something. Now, I don't know if you're even hiding anything from me, I just want you to be straight. You don't have to worry about me calling you no punk or trippin' or nothing like that. All right, man, go ahead. Talk. You and Brandy, man, what's up with that? Ok, uh.. You be straight with me. Whatever you say to me makes me no never-mind. Whatever. Just let me know. I mean, if you're gonna be spending time with Brandy, Hey, I'll make other plans. I understand. Nigger, tell the truth, ok? Be direct. Trying to hide something from me, be all undercover. I'm your boy. I'm in your corner. I want to see you happy. And if being happy is being with Brandy... Y'all are going to be all in love then, you know... It don't mean shit to me. All right? Well, um... I'm glad you feel that way, man, 'cause, uh... Me and Brandy, uh... Uh... We in love. Oh, no, nigga! No, no, no! You're lying, right? What do you mean you're not lying? You can't be serious about that sorry excuse for a man. I'm saying, girl, he ain't got no money. He's got potential. He's working. Taking baby pictures!? He's got a dream, Adina. Correction. Martin Luther King had a dream. He ain't got no money. She ain't no better than her friend. She's a gold digger. Gold diggers run in packs like dogs. Money ain't bad, but what about a good heart? Some motivation? A little honesty? Yeah, ok. Well, at least I'm still hard, and I'm still holding my own. You're getting soft. Yeah. You get sprung when every woman that comes around throws you some. So a brother who admits he's in love can't be hard. That's what I'm hearing. I'm saying something like that. Hell, I'm hard. I love hard, see? When I love a woman, she knows she's being loved. Because why? Because I come hard with my love. Ooh. Oh. That's nice. You understand, I ain't giving up no soft love. I come correct, see? You know? I love from here... And from here... Not just down here. That's right. Make your point to the brother. That's right. See, now, I might use... I might use what's down here to reinforce the love I'm giving from here and here, but the single-minded focus that it takes to love from here, here, and here all at the same time... Man, you can't get no harder than that. Whoo! Go get some more! Whoa. Chill out, man. Damn. Chill. Go ahead, Young Man! It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. All right. Where you think you at, man? Girl, yeah. Boy! Are we still cool? Oh, we're cool. We're cool. All right. All right. Cool. Oh, by the way, uh... Me and Brandy... We're moving in together. What?! You heard me. We're moving in. This is getting way out of hand. See, the way I see it is that, uh... My friend is on a serious rebound trip, and he can't see that your friend is nothing but a big, scheming skeezer... Like you. First of all, you keep talking that mess, and you'll be wearing this coffee. Second, your friend is the scheming skeezer. He wishes he deserved to be with anybody I even.. Not even.. Anybody I've even seen walk down the street, which he doesn't. Both of y'all ain't nothin' but a couple of phony, broke, perpetratin'.. Ho, ho, ho, ho. Perpetratin'? Perpetratin'. Well, you didn't think I was perpetratin' when I was waxin' that booty, now, did you? In case you didn't get the news flash, well, here it is: You know how many different women I had to think about just to keep myself at attention? Oh, yes, and you must've enjoyed it 'cause you was whoopin' and hollerin' all night. Damn near got me evicted. Screamin' and poundin' on the walls. Ooh. Oh, stop. Ooh. Ooh. That's my head. Hold it a minute. Ooh, that's the spot. Hey! Oh! You're hittin' the bottom. Oh! Aah! The only reason I encouraged you was because I figured eventually you might find the hole, which you never did, and the only reason I was hollerin' so loud was to keep from laughin' at all those ugly faces you was makin'. Uhh! G-g-guh! Mmph! Eee! Uhh! Ok. All right. All right! Now, I ain't Harry, and you definitely ain't Sally, ok? So Montel's my partner, and Brandy's your girl, and if they hook up long-term, then that means we'll be seeing a lot of each other, and I can't abide by that, so we got to do something, fast, for their good and definitely for ours. Guess that's about the only thing you ever said that wasn't a lie. So... You got any ideas up in that peanut-size brain of yours? Yes, I do... Miss Wiggy. But you got to be willing to go all the way, 'cause I'm talkin' about some lowdown... Back-stabbin', treacherous... Triflin', manipulative, insidious... Fiendish, machiavellian, deceitful... Unconscionable, egregious, nasty... Diabolical, unscrupulous, and just downright... Ign'ant. Ign'ant. Ahem. Ahem. Check. Uhh! Oh, man, movin' is a big deal, now. Come on, Montel. How much do you really know about this woman anyway? Yo, Clyde, what do I know? Look, I know some.. I know about.. Anyhow, look I know the important thing. I know we're in love. How's that? No, no, no, girl. I hear you. You are in love. I am truly happy for you, but do you really know this man? Well, who knows what secrets he could be hiding. Girl, some of these men have babies just spread all across the country, wives in other cities. Ohh. Not to mention boyfriends. Boyfriends? When he walks, sometimes I see a little you know. Man, this is filthy. Oh, man. Hey, let me tell you about this sucker I knew... Hooked up with this girl he met in church. She was supposed to be sanctified. I mean sanctified. You hear me? Man, my man married homegirl and thought he was set for life. He worked his ass off, too, for her. Mmm! Then he came home, only to find she was doing his best friend, the mailman, the trainer at the gym. Even the minister stopped by for some. He had 3 or 4 of his gangbangers from the youth group. Then they all got down. That shit was so scandalous, man, even Geraldo refused to tell the story. That's real fucked up, man. Girl, you got a career to think about, remember? You ain't got time to be somebody's mother. Some of them want to have you cookin' and cleanin' all the damn time, scrubbin' the skid marks off their nasty-ass drawers, like you ain't got nothin' else to do. And you never know if she's got that... After-the-baby, middle-age fat gene. Ooh. Ooh. Oh, Baby, you always give me an appetite. Oh! Sure, she looks fine right now, but just wait till that middle-age fat gene kicks in on your ass and turns your king-size bed from a luxury to a motherfuckin' necessity! Puttin' on some pounds, ain't ya? Oh, I've seen it happen. From a cute, cuddly teddy bear to a big ol' ugly boogie-boogie bear just over night! And once they have a regular source for sex, you know they just let themselves go. Here we go. Put it down right there. I know what to do. Don't tell me what to do. Oh, yeah. You bring that big old thing.. Hey! Hey! Don't touch me, you old buzzard. I still got something. I still got a little something. Oh, you wouldn't even remember what it looked like. I know what it looked like. It was that big thing, there was a crack in it. I can still work it, girl. I can still work it. I got something... (Mumbling) Yeah, shit. Um, can you two excuse us for a moment, please? Oh, yeah, Baby. If you need me, I'm right back here. Yeah, me, too. Montel, we need to talk. Yeah. Be honest with me, ok? Mm-hmm. Got any babies? No. Wives? No. Homosexual tendencies? Hell no. What about you? Undercover crackhead. No. Closet nympho? Sneakin'? Freakin'? No. Fat moms? Boogie bear in the family tree? Definitely not. All that's true? Yeah, and everything you told me the truth, Baby? Oh, yeah, Baby. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Whew. We gotta use more drastic measures. Yeah. Let them see what it's like on the dark side. Mmm. I like the way you're working over that fudge bar, girl. You got it going on yourself with that cherry pop, Baby. I know how to work it. I know how to do it. Ha ha ha ha.

If you got pregnant, they act like you're the traitor, like you sold secrets to the Russians or something. Yellin' and screamin' and naggin'! Then she'll say she's sorry, you'll accept the apology, you make up, and then... Pow! Baby number 2. After the baby, your titties start saggin', your body's a mess! And after you're married, you ain't gotta worry about no more babies, 'cause after you're married, all the fuckin' stops. You lose your identity, you lose your self-respect, you lose your soul.

It's just like Clyde not to tell somebody. Hey, I thought he left, like he went to hell or something. You are so funny, man. Montel, were you always this funny? And, um... This cute? Uh... Yeah, always. See, you just never gave me a chance to show you my talents. Especially your talent for cock blocking. Hey, everybody makes mistakes, but, um... We can correct them, too. Yeah. Uh... So.. So you came here alone? Yeah. Um, I took a cab here to meet someone, but I guess they aren't coming. Probably heard I was gonna be here. You know, didn't want the competition.

What was that all about? Wh-what did Latisha say? Nothin'. She's just starting some mess, girl. You know Latisha. Right, I know, but she had said something about Montel. Girl, would you just leave it alone? She's just crazy. Adina, what did she say?! Goodness! Fine. Latisha said that she saw your man mongoose walkin' into her building with some big-bootied model heifer. Veronique.. Yeah, that was her name. She's french. Creole. Beautiful. But it's nothing. French. Be a trip, boy. That girl... Is wrong. That girl Latisha. Did she say what he was wearing? Tan vest, white shirt. But I wouldn't worry. Where she live? 5555 West Grove.

You know, there was a lot of love for you from a lot of guys because you.. You.. You were so lovable... And.. And smart... And the thing is I always had... These crazy fantasies about you, and me with my camera... And you... With all that stuff you have. I mean, I always knew that you-you-you'd do well. And I guess, um... I am just saying... You know, that I think I'm.. I'm, like, very... Proud of you. What did you say? Um... Proud? I'm... Proud of you. All this... Is impressive. Down, boy. Um, Veronica... Why are you crying? Do..
