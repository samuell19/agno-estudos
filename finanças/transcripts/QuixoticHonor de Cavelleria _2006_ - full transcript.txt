Sancho, is it fixed yet? It's fixed. Really? I didn't see you do anything. - Is it fixed? - It's fixed. It won't hurt me? I have to ask you a favor. - It won't hurt me, will it? - Not now. You have to do me a favor. Could you go and find me a laurel wreath? Go and find a laurel wreath. Can you do that? Yes. Find a laurel wreath. Go and look for one. Can you do that? Sancho, you can go to sleep. Go on, Sancho. Sancho! Are you asleep? You were snoring. Thank you, Sancho. Can you give me the sword, please? Can you put it on for me? That's not right. You're still asleep, Sancho. You were snoring a lot. How's that? Where are we going? You lead the way. But take a path you know. You almost know more paths than Quixote. Shall we continue? We're doing well, Sancho, bit by bit. These are wild boar tracks. - Have you ever had a dog? - Yes, I've had several. Were they good dogs? Good... Regular. - Do you like dogs? - Not much. Not much? I've had everything. But I like dogs. Talking of dogs, that sounds like wolves. They're very big. They're beautiful. Has a dog ever bitten you? Or gone "Woof!" at you? - Never? - Never. I got a little fright once. - Did a little dog bite you? - No. - It was just a fright. - And what did it do? - It went "Woof!". - Really? - The sun will be up soon. - It's rising over there. Look how beautiful it is. Look at the sun. - Sancho, do you see it? - Yes. Let's go up this way. You lead, Sancho. It's very hot. Thank you, Sancho. Help me, hold the two of them for a minute. You look tired, Sancho. Very tired. You'll soon feel better. Cheer up, Sancho. Look up at the sky. Say something to Him and He'll listen. Ask God for strength. God is up above us. Yes, Sancho, do that and we'll have strength. Aren't you feeling better now? Look up at the sky for a moment and rest. Say to Him: "God, do not abandon us." God, do not abandon us. Give us strength, lots of strength. Rest now and He'll give you strength. Aren't you feeling better? You're much better now. Come on, don't keep leaning on that. Look at how strong you are now. Don't you see? - Aren't you? - Yes. Look up. This tree is beautiful too. Is it dead? Sancho, did you tell me that it didn't rain? You were asleep! The horse is wet and the donkey is wet too. And I told you there are snails here. You know why? Because it rained. You're a scatterbrain, but I still love you. There was a great storm and you didn't even notice, Sancho. You're always asleep. Look, this place is full of snails. You said it didn't rain because you were asleep. Look how wet the horses are. You're an ass. When Quixote says something, you have to listen. But you're always asleep. Don't you see all these snails? Look at that one. There's a snail. Don't you see it? You're asleep. You're asleep, Sancho. Quixote is telling you. With you, I'd spend my whole life sleeping and I'd have a lousy time. But I love you. You have to follow my path even if you don't understand it. It's God who gives the orders. Don't listen to Lancelot or anyone. I've been ordered to give orders, and I'm giving you orders. Lancelot was an admirable man. He thought like us. But he isn't here anymore and he's sent me to help you. If you don't listen to me, we'll argue, even if I do love you. But follow me, and do what Quixote tells you to do. Do you want to swim? Do you want to cool down? What's the water like? It's fine. Can I swim? It's just to cool down. You want to cool down? - You don't want to? - No, I don't. Watch me, I can't swim well. I'm tired. Is the water cold? Let's see. It's not cold at all. - Don't you want to swim? - No. It's lovely. I can even stand up. I don't feel so tired now. I feel better. When we were on the road I was getting tired. This water is paradise. Watch. Shall I cool you down? Don't you feel better? Come in a bit further. You'll be all right. Why not take that off? Don't you want to? Are you all right like that? Look! God gave us this water. Sancho, this is God's water, Christians' water. I'm waiting for you. Come on, both of us. That's good. Isn't the water nice? Very nice. Let's swim around a bit. You can drink this water. You can drink it. Very good, Sancho. You're a good swimmer. Shall we go now? Shall we get our clothes and go? - Or are you all right? - I'm all right. - Shall we stay a bit longer? - Yes. All right. Think about God's work, Sancho. God has given us this. This is nice, isn't it? I told you. I told you it would do us good to cool down. - It's very hot, Sancho. - Yes, very. It's been very hot for a few days. This looks too big. Sit here, Sancho. We've got a stone now. We'll have a bite to eat. Sit down and relax. Slowly. - Which rock do you want? - Whichever. We can break it with this. This'll do us good. It'll give us strength. Don't you eat cheese? Keep eating, Sancho. You never knew the Golden Age. Well, in the Golden Age evil didn't exist and there were no problems. Everyone loved each other. In Adam and Eve's time, there were no problems either. But the Golden Age was better. No one got angry, no one fought, Sancho, and everyone loved each other. It was a time of peace and quiet. We have to try, with all our strength. I think we'll manage it. What do you think? I think we will. We'll manage it, with effort. We knights are invincible. Because you know that God has given us the strength to do it. And we'll do it, Sancho. These walnuts are good, aren't they? Hurry up. I'll hold this. Very good, Sancho. Very good. Very good, Sancho. Pons de Perell?s! Son of a bitch! Villain! I'll kill you! God will punish him. And so will Quixote. I'm waiting for you. Are you angry? - Don't you hear me calling you? - I'm coming. Don't make me shout. Come here immediately. Where are you going? You always get lost. Turn round. Don't go off on your own. Sancho, come back. Come back, Sancho. Goodbye, Sancho. He doesn't want to come! Bastard! Son of a bitch! After all I've done for you, you don't deserve to come with me. Goodbye, Sancho. Will you come? Say yes. Goodbye, Sancho. See how you went the wrong way? If I hadn't called, you wouldn't have come back. Are you thinking about what I explained? Sancho, think about it. Think about what I explained to you. It's good for you and for God. Because you have strayed too. I'll teach you because I was lost too. I was lost but I found my way. Do you like coming with me, Sancho? We have to follow the path, but give me your hand. God has said that you and I are brothers. I'm the elder brother and you're the younger. Look up and say: "Forever". We're going to look up and say: "God, you are the best." - God, you are the best. - You are the best, God. Forever. He heard us. God heard us. - Yes. - He heard us. He's up there, but He is the right path. Yes, Sancho. God, help Sancho, he's going to follow your path. Guide Sancho. You have called me and I have to come. God, I will come, but I still have to show Sancho the path. I have to wait a while before coming up. I have to work on Sancho. I don't know much about birds. You do, don't you, Sancho? I'd like to see it. Thank you. It's big, but it doesn't look dangerous. Do you think it'll come back? This bird is looking for company. Are you all right, Sancho? You've got good eyesight. It's passing over us but we can't see it anywhere. Andianmo! Sancho! Look at the sky! Sancho, look at the sky! Tell me something. You must have something to tell. Yes, lots of adventures. Adventures? Chivalrous adventures. As a child, did you like all that stuff about adventures and chivalry? Well, I'd never done it. Have you never had to kill anyone? Or have you killed someone? I haven't. - But Quixote has. - Really? How many has he killed? - Two. - Two? How did he kill them? Did you see it? With his sword. - Is Quixote a good swordsman? - He knows a lot. Tell me how he killed those two men with his sword. Like this. Why do you travel with him? Because I like it. With Quixote. Would you be Sancho if there was no Quixote? Who knows? Do you think he appreciates you? I'd say so. Where is he now? - Are you going to wait for him? - Yes. Will he be long? Does he always make you wait so long? Not always. He's a knight. Yes. - Does Quixote have a wife? - Yes. Yes? Wouldn't you rather go home and have a wife too? I guess so. What will you do when you finish...? I don't know. What did you do before? I was a laborer. Did you build a lot of houses? You could build a house for yourself and live in it. I'm not good enough to build myself a house. As you know, we've had a lot of adventures, Sancho. And we've won, but even so I feel sad. Life is a path of sadness. It's very sad because there are bad people. God is showing me the path of death. He's saying: "Come, Quixote." I'm very tired, Sancho. But you'll continue on my path. I know God has called me. And I'm so tired that I can feel death. But I trust in you, Sancho. God has told us that you will carry on with the work we've begun. God has sent you. You must promise me you'll carry on with this work. I have to die, Sancho. I can confess it to you, my friend Sancho. Beloved Sancho. Quixote loves you. So does God. Can't you see I'm worn out? God wants me in Heaven. He told me so, Sancho. But from Heaven I'll watch you as you follow our path. Will you do it? Say that you will. Yes. I feel like crying. Do you know why? Because I'm leaving you. You see, Sancho? Chivalry is civilization. It rewards those who tell the truth. And it punishes those who tell lies. Chivalry is the reasoning of action. Do you understand? From the gleam in your eye, I see that you do.
