- You're right. And all you have to do is not doit. That's all you have to do, is not do it. Just don't do it. You look in the mirror, you open your mouth and you stick out your tongue, and oh, it's too late, it's toolate. I'll quit tomorrow. And then you do, you do. But you're never not an addict though.

You should know how to tie a tie. - Well then fuck you, pal, I'm not wearing it. - You gotta wear it, man. - Anyway, so now she's still ringing the phone, and still nothing. - Well, yeah, he's not gonna stop that affair. - No, no, no, here's the punchline. This guy was out on the fuckinglake fishing all morning. - Fishing? - He was out on the Lake fishing. He missed a day's pay, okay. A strike against him. Who knows what with his fuckingugly wife. All so he can go sit out on the lake, and what? Go fishing. - That's it? - That's it, just wanted to fish. He didn't even feel bad. - Did he catch anything? - [Marty] I don't know, that's not the fucking point, man. - Then what's the point, Marty? - The point is you don't listen. - I'm listening! All I'm saying is if he had reeled in a three foot pike, then maybe it was worth his trouble. - Getting ready for what? Getting ready for your show? Yes, I'm excited, I'm excited to see Marty. I miss him, so, that'll be fun. They may have like a yacht thing set up, I don't know. You know how San Francisco is. - Will you relax, bro? He just text me a half hour ago, he just got into Vegas. I don't know why we can't just go to a Coney Island. I want French toast. - If it's about the money, I don't want you worrying about it, I got it covered. - No, no, no, this weekend is on me and Gavin. All right, so get your ID, maybe some gambling money, and leave your fat fucking wallet here. - Gavin couldn't of sprung for a suite on the strip and cashed residual or something? - I booked the room. - Room's pretty nice, Marty. - Fuck you, pal. He's giving me cash anyway, okay, 'cause he wanted to stay off thegrid. - Oh yeah, right, his sponsor. - That or his girl. - Oh my God. All right, what is it this time model or actress? - It's a dancer. - You're kidding me. How conducive can that be to his situation? - No, no, she's a legit fucking dancer, bro. She works at one of those shows on the strip. - Well, it would be a real shame if she busted him here. - All right, I'll let you get back to it. I just wanted to tell you that Ilove you and that I'll talk to you soon,okay? All right, one day, that's it. All right, love you, bye. - [Shane] At least let me finishfirst. - You sick bastard. - Prude bastard. What, two is it? - Two and a half. - That's right, Marty Half hand, truly a wild man. - I got it out at a young age. - Yeah, they call it settling down for a reason, Marty. - Fuck you, pal, aren't you about to do the same thing? - Yes, [sighing] I am. [knocking on door] - He's here, play nice, asshole. He's a good guy, unless you're abad guy. - Not even a foot in the fucking door yet, Jesus, man give me a fucking break. - [Marty] How you doing, man? - Oh man, I feel like I just walked in a fucking time machine. - [Shane] It's good to see you Gavin. - Congratulations. - Thanks, man. - [Marty] Don't call him Gavin. That's Johnny fucking McNabb. - Calm down, Marty, all right? You can get his autograph later. - Nobody wants my autograph anymore. - Come on bro, it's just a speedbump. - Yeah, well anyway. What are we doing, what's the deal? Shouldn't Shaney be half shot in the ass by now? - No, no, no, no. I think we're gonna do the dry thing this weekend. - Oh yeah, nice. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro, that one's mine. - You guys realize that I can'tget drunk if you drink it, right? I'm fine, seriously, can we just have a good night? - Great! [chuckling] - So how about a Coney Island for dinner? - French toast? - I'm not going to Coney Island. - How's Hope doing, by the way? - Well, she's doing actually pretty good. She's up at her ma's in TraverseCity. - Yeah, but, you know what I mean. Is she all right? What's going on? - I'm going to Coney Island before I leave here. All right, assholes? And what's this world renowned restaurant anyway, bachelor boy? - Actually, you know, I had a change a plans. I got us tickets to go see a show on the strip. - Why'd you say it like that? [both laughing] Oh, fuck you, guys. - All right, what's the deal, who is she? - Wait, wait, wait, let's do therundown. - Oh, yeah, Latina for sure. - Nope. - Asian. - Nope. - Russian? - No. - Teriyakian. - She's Filipino. - I just said Asian, it's the same thing. - Oh, man. - It's not the same thing. - We got a dinner reservation that we're late for and I still gotta get dressed, so, let's get rolling. - [Marty] Please, 'cause I'm fucking starving. - All right, I just have to piss and then I'm ready. [cellphone chiming] [dramatic music] [toilet flushing] [sink water running] - [Shane] Yeah, babe, just goingout now. - [Marty] Seriously, bro, just get off the phone already. - [Shane] Will you chill out, bro? Why don't you call Annabelle orsomething? [dramatic music] - [Gavin] What you gonna do Marty? - [Marty] I'm going all in. - [Gavin] I call, Shane, grab me a slice, will ya? - [Shane] Yeah, you got it, cheese or pepperoni? - [Gavin] Pepperoni, please. What do you got? - I got nothing, it's unbelievable. - He always has a hand, that guy's always been the luckyone. - Not a game of luck, my friend, you know that. - Completely a game a luck. - Okay, Shane, you're right, it's a game a luck. - Well, did you earn those cards? Did you have to work for 'em? No, they were handed to you. - Well, I was patient until the right cards came along and then I took a chance and played 'em right. - It's ironic logic coming froma person who has a lucky number tattooed on their hand. - Well, that's true. But this is a little different. - I'm just saying, you play the cards that you're dealt whatever the fuck they are. - I guess we'll see either way when he blows them on the bluff. - But if I do, I'll go out and win some more. How's your folks? - Same old, still living back inDetroit. What do you think this is? - I don't know, is it like a Formica? - [Shane] Yeah, it could be. - It's really sturdy. - Wow, it's good craftsmanship. - Yeah, it's really nice, I was just thinking. Where do you think he went? - I don't know. - So, how's our boys? You ready for the surprise? Huh, look at this. - [Gavin] And, what is it? - Oh shit, sorry about that. - Oh my God. - Woo! - Okay, now you remember? Deja vu anybody? - [Shane] Holy cow. - [Gavin] You do not still have that. - This. Okay. - [Shane] What. - [Marty] So, should we play? - I'm not playing that game? If you could change one thing about your body, what would it be? - Look at this thing, oh my God. - My nose and my dick size. [laughing] - All right, it was too easy. Marty, you would change that horrible nose, and Gavin would lose his baby dick. - What's wrong with my nose? - I was actually nose, I'm pretty content with my dick size, thank you, though. - It's not that it's little, it could just always be bigger,right? - See, that's exactly what somebody would say with a baby dick. - Gavin has a point, Marty. - Fuck you guys. It's my turn, all right... How old will you guys be when you get married? - Oh man. You set this one up. - 28. And 28. - [Marty] You're gay, wow, I always land on that. - Whoa, no, no, wait, wait, wait, how does thatwork? - What are you talking about, dude? You both said 28, I can't get itwrong. - No kidding, Sherlock, I'm talking to this one. - I wanted to wait until after this weekend to tell you guys because I didn't wanna steal your thunder or anything like that, but-- - [Marty] Don't start, Shane. - No, no, I got a couple of questions, that's all. - Ask away. - All right. Who is this girl you're apparently marrying this year? - This girl is named Addie, the one I told you about. - Addie, that's right. This is the Filipino one, right? The dancer, the [speaking in foreign language] - Yeah, that's the one. That's the only girlfriend I have. I know that's a tough concept. - [Marty] Oh God, here we go board flip, T minus two. - Oh no, I'm not sure what you mean by that? - If you could go back in time to any one day, what day would it be and why? - "I picked the day Hope served us at Coney Island "because the way her ass filled those fucking jeans." I picked the day Gavin moved toLA, because I'd smacked some sense into him. - I already know I want the day that Shane fucked my ex because it's not like we were best friends or anything. - [Marty] Oh, wow, this is really a lotta fun. - Here we go. You know what? I wanna change mine. I pick the day Gavin got on television and became too good for his friends. - I didn't become too good for Marty, just for you. - You haven't been too good for anybody in the last year. - [Marty] Oh, fuck you, Shane. He doesn't mean that, G. - [Shane] No, I do. I really do. - Will you shut you? It's okay, anyway. I remember this one, I wrote this one. How many times have you jerked off in one day? - Listen, Shane, I know the past few years have been really fucked up withme. I know that, and I have some regrets. But the heaviest is this thing with you, and I just wanna make amends. I was mad, okay? I wasn't over it, I'm sorry. I mean that, I'm sorry, both ofyou. Okay? Now can we please have a good time celebrating you and your beautiful soon to be before I flip the fucking board? - Yeah. - Thank you. - No, seriously though, guys, how many times in one day have you jacked off? [Gavin laughing] If you put your tongue down here like that, try to talk without moving yourtongue. - The darker featured, like-- - What the fuck, man? Why do you always get to be the cool guy? - Dude, he was sexy as fuck. ♪ Please never go - You're probably gonna be the backup singer, right? I got a guy that's gonna shoot our album cover. - I can see it. - Your eyes are drying out. What the fuck? I'm the backup singer? - No, no, no I think if Marty comes in with like a rap type thing. ♪ We've been moving like we're soap going down the drain ♪ - And I'll be lead vocals, obviously. ♪ I can't stop dreaming of you - No, they were all equally cool back then. - Yeah, back then, now, what arethey? - Marty! - [Marty] What? - Come on, man, I'm fucking bored. - [Shane] Marty, where's your stripper? - Where is she? - [Marty] What do you want, guys? - It's been like two fucking hours, I wanna go gamble. - You know what? I'm just like, I'm so flabbergasted by your social media and the comments you get on here. - You're flabbergasted? - Yeah. There's like a hundreds of comments a day from hot chicks that you don't even acknowledge. - What do you want me to do? - Have you seen this shit, man? - Oh, I look at it every day. - I think you should reevaluatereading the comments on here and who you're gonna reply to. - I hate reading that shit. - Have you tried any DMing on here? - People are so fucking mean onthere. - Marty, tell me what a DM is? - What do you mean? It's a fucking inbox message. [Shane and Gavin laughing] - What is it again? - [Marty] It's the same thing as an inbox message. [Shane and Gavin laughing] - Why are you calling it that? - [Marty] Because DM is inbox message and if you wanna step your game up even further you send her a meme. [Shane and Gavin laughing] Okay, I'm talking like extra funny memes. - Why would I send her a meme? - Could you imagine? - Because if you don't send a meme, how is she gonna know your senseof humor? [Shane and Gavin laughing] What are you waiting on, man? You should send multiple inboxes, man. What the fuck? You know what? - No, you're absolutely right. - You know what? I can't even look at this anymore. All I know is I shoulda been famous like you, pal. Because I woulda been inboxing all of 'em. [Shane and Gavin laughing] You know what? Wait a minute, I just thought of something. - Are you gonna go inbox a couple people? - What the fuck is the matter with him? - [Shane] Oh my God. - Was he always like that? - [Shane] Yeah, he was. - Oh my God. [laughing] - Oh yeah, inbox this, guys. Look at this, man. You know what this is? Does anybody know what this is at all? - No idea. - No, you have no idea? - No, what is it? - Couldn't possibly guess what this is? - If it's a picture of your mom I'm gonna be very upset. - You're close, but no. - Come on, what is it? - [Marty] Bang. - Oh, dude. - [Marty] Do you remember this? - What is it? I can't see it. Jesus Christ, Marty. - [Gavin] What the fuck? - You need one of these in your office over your desk, man. - Oh my God. - [Gavin] What the fuck is the matter with you? - What do you mean? - Oh my God! - [Gavin] Dude. - What are you talking about? - [Gavin] Dude, this is too fucking much, come on. - This fucking poster is fucking sick, dude. - [Gavin] Dude, you have a poster of me. - What do you mean? Listen, I want you to sign this fucking thing. - I'm not signing that fucking thing, dude. You need to get rid of that. - First of all, lookit, this is the sickest poster. Look at the fire in your eyes here, man. What do you mean? Look how sick this is. - Are you out of your mind? - First of all, this was limited. I had to order this off Ebay, dude. - Oh, you hear that? Ebay, he got it off Ebay. - I did. - You couldn't have it inboxed? - No, no, no, no, no, no. Not only that, but I had to pay for fucking-- - Dude, seriously, that's not fucking cool, man. - I had to pay for two day shipping on this, man. - Dude. - Listen, I'm a power seller onEbay. I mean, this is just fucking awesome, that's all I know. I want you to sign it. Are you gonna sign the tiny city? - I'm not fucking signing that. - Right on the bottom. And, if you put it all togetherwith the fire in your eye, the exploding gun, that fucking flammable tiny cities, it's like... Look at these, wait. - It's not a tiny city, it's just a city. - [Marty] I even picture these guys as alien warriors. Look, they're like alien-- - They're SWAT team members! - [Marty] No, these are alien warriors. - What the fuck is the matter with you? - [Marty] These are like fucking reptilian shape shifting hybrids, man, I'm telling you right now. - [Shane] Shape shifting hybrids? - [Marty] Yeah, look at the poster. - [Shane] I've seen the poster, you just showed me. - It's a police show. It's a police show. - [Marty] There are shape shifting hybrids in the sewer systems on this show, I know it. [all laughing] [snickering] - Marty, tell us a story. - Guy at work, he had to shave his eyebrows off. - What the fuck? - No, listen, fuck head. - You work with the strangest people. - So this apprentice goes down river to this strip club with his buddies from work, and this place is a real fuckingdisaster. It shoulda been condemned, or torn down, or I don't know, maybe new staff. The apprentice and his buddies decide we wanna run a bet who can go the furthest with one of these fucking mutated, monster, these cellulite, skid mark having, cobble pot looking strippers. [Shane and Gavin laughing] And I'm talking track marks, snot running down their nose. That's the kind of place it was. You didn't have to tip much there. Listen, put it this way, they even serve potato skins with like, who's gonna want potato skins in this fucking place when you have your fist up somebody's ass? Guys are fucking doing shots off the girl's tits. This guy's doing shots off a girl's ass. I'm talking about crazy shit happening here. So, the young apprentice wants to show off in front of his coworkers and hedecides, well, you know what? I'm good with my tongue. He's gonna go down on one of these classic mutants, you know, with like a '70s "Boogie Nights" bush. So he's focused, he's doesn't care. He wants to go down on her. Tongue, bush, tongue, bush, tongue, bush, tongue, bush, potato skins, potato skins. He goes down on her. He wakes up the next day, hestarts clawing at his eyebrows, and flaking, and flaking, and irritation. He's got crabs in his eyebrows. Shaves 'em right off. - [Gavin] No way. - Wait a second. Wouldn't they not be crabs though if they're in his eyebrows? - [Shane] What? - Wouldn't it just be lice because it's not in his pubes? - No, it'd still be crabs because its origination was somebody's pubes. - No, I mean, crabs are defined based on the fact that they inhabit a pubic region. If they were to be relocated viathe story to somebody's eyebrows, they would just be lice. - Okay. Listen, you relocated to California, right? - [Gavin] Yeah. - But your origination was Detroit, correct? You carry that with you? - No, no, no, no, I've assimilated, I'm one of them now. - Mm-mm, no, no, you act like one of them, you pretend. But a crab can never act, or pretend, or play the part of anything other than a crab. It would always be seen as something that originated in somebody's pubes. Therefore, it could never assimilate. It would always be shunned by any of the other infesting inhabitants. - Well excuse me, Shane. I would like to think that that even a crab could leave his dirty past behind him. - The point is, keep your face out of her pussy before she gets here. - No, no, no, no. I will clear her seat when she arrives. - You would really let her sit on your face? - Yeah, I absolutely would. I'm sorry. - No, I don't think so, 'cause it's just gonna be dances 'cause that's all I paid for, guys. - Shall I retrieve my wallet? And Gavin, don't sit there and pretend like you've never slept with a stripper. - I haven't, I swear. - Really? - Come on. - Yeah, really. - You mean to tell me after allof that you never wound up sleeping withone? - No, I didn't. And I never did it for fun or for the thrills. You know, I guess if I had sex with somebody, I always preferred to be the fucked up one. - Don't sit there and tell me that you weren't having fun, man. I saw the pictures on your social media with the models, and the parties, and the craziness. Dude, it looks like a lotta funto me. - No, I mean, I may have done some things that some people wouldconsider fun, but I don't know. I don't really remember. - See, there you go. You did it, but you don't remember. If you weren't having any fun atall, why would you continue to do it? - Don't get me wrong, I was enjoying it, it felt really fucking good. That's why I continued to do it. The problem is that, that'sthe only thing that feels good. You know, kinda like it desaturates everything, you know? It's like, that's a wrap. - Is that set speak? I don't really follow what you're saying. - That's a wrap. You know, that's a wrap on sex, on fun, on friends, on family, on your job, that's a wrap on everything, but getting fucking high. You know. - It's terrifying. - Yeah, it is. I've killed the buzz here, I'm sorry. - No, bro, you're cool. - Well, I think we're having a shower anyway, before she gets here, if she ever does. - She'll be here. [dramatic music] [cell phone chiming] - Here's to my favorite prick lawyer in the world. Nobody else I'd call if I were in trouble or caught in the rain. 15 years of friendship, and a lifetime of happiness. And to one piece of pussy for the rest of your life. - I don't know about all that, but... - You know this, it's gonna put a damper on the night. But I'm a little buzzed, so fuckit. - What's wrong buddy, everythingokay? - Well, we hope so. [cell phone vibrating] Is that Annabelle? Tell her I say hi. - Mm-mm, no, no, no. She's probably just sleeping orsomething. It's just one of my interns. - What the fuck is she doing up? - Something about a case. - All right, look bro, she's gonna be here any minute now, so you know what? Let me just get this out. - You wanna see your picture? - Whose? - My intern. - Why the fuck would I wanna seea picture of your intern, dude? I'm trying to talk to you, man. - Because she's got a great ass, and it's my bachelor party, and your stripper still isn't even here yet. - Great ass. Let's see.

She didn't even take her tits out yet. [laughing softly] [dramatic music] - I never understood whypeople would think that addicts didn't know they had a problem. Of course you know. You taste it in your teeth everymorning. It doesn't make a difference. - [Marty] Are you okay? - And you believe it, you believe it, you really believe it. And they know. They know, and they're right, they're right. They're right. And all you have to do is not doit. That's all you have to do, is not do it, just don't do it. You look in the mirror, and you open your mouth, and you stick out your tongue, and oh, it's too late. [chuckling] It's too late. I'll quit tomorrow. And then you do. You do.

Look, man, don't take your relapse out on me. - G, listen, why don't you just go in the bathroom, puke that shit out, come back out here, we can all just chill out? - What are you even doing here,Marty? You should be at home with Hope, this is fucking ridiculous, you did not belong here. - Well first of all, he is here because he's one of the only friends that you have. - I said, shut the fuck up, Shane! You don't know the first thing about fucking friendship, so I don't wanna hear another goddamn word, okay, we both fucking know you. - What's he talking about? - Nothing, man, clearly he's just fucking pissed off right now. So if we just give him a minute. - Yeah, clearly, you just terrified that poor girl! - Yeah, I terrified her right off your fucking cock, you fucking pervert. Now I know you, I know you. And I know you only came here to get fucked, so why don't you go and get fucked? I am sure she will never know! - You know what? Stop saying that. What did I ever do to you? Like honestly, what, I slept with an ex-girlfriend five years ago? - What did you do to me? Are you fucking serious? What did you do to me? What did you fucking do to me, Shane? Where were you, huh? No, I seriously wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know right now, where the fuck were you? - What are you even talking about? - Marty was there, where were you? - You know what? [chuckling] I'm not sticking around for thisshit. You've always been a selfish asshole, and you will always be a selfishasshole. - Why don't you fucking do something about it and stop running your smart fucking mouth? - [Marty] Just stop, fucking stop, please. - Shut up, shut up, Marty. Sit down, sit down, Marty, - Stop, man. - I'm not fucking kidding, sit down. Do something, Shane, do it, finally fucking do it. Finally fucking do something, you piece of shit. [suspenseful music] [Gavin panting] - Look, man, I'm sorry bud, but that shit right there, that shit was bound to happen. I know you wanted to have a goodweekend and you wanted to bring the boys back together, but I'm not sticking around for that shit, have fun. - When I was a little girl on my island, where I'm from, there was this bridge that all the guys would go to and they would carry these big rocks and they would jump off the bridge. And the rock would carry them all the way down to the bottom. They would stay down there and they could see everything because the water was so clear. And they'd collect things like sea urchins, and starfish, sand dollars. I don't know what you guys callit, but in my language it's called [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] And they would sell it or they would eat it and that's how they would make their living. - We'll open up a shop on the beach and we'll sell. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - I don't wanna get anything. I just wanna be down there. And I'll brush the sand like this. And then I'll brush it and I'll see if I can search forstingrays because they like to hide underthe sand. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - How are you gonna get back up? - Just swim. - Well, how deep is it? - Like 30 feet. - 30 feet, and you're gonna swim? - Is that deep? - Yeah, that's deep. - Okay, like 20 feet. - Oh, just 20. That's it. - That's it. But I wanna go, and even if it's just for a minute it's gonna be worth it. - What if you run outta air? - That's the fun part. You actually run out of air. - You're nuts. - Go with me. [groaning] - Soak it up, buddy. - I'm not hungry. - Hello, I don't give a shit if you're a Gandhi on a hunger strike, eat the burger. - I don't like pickles. - Just pick them off. - It'll still taste like pickles. It'll always taste like pickles. - You need to eat it. - Maybe I do need it. Maybe I deserve it. - So eat it. - No. I just won't eat. - Why the fuck not? - 'Cause everything that I did was for a burger without pickles. And not loving me. - I'm sure the burger loves you,pal. Really, just take a bite and see. - I guess I'm ruined too, so why should I be able to have the perfect burger? - What do you wanna fucking filet mignon, man? [cell phone ringing] - The burger can go fuck itself, Marty, no pickles. - I get that you're a little wasted right now. You're not making much sense. So just try and be straight withme 'cause all this bullshit you're spewing out about this burger is like reallymaking me salitate over it. - Go ahead, take a bite, everybody else does. - Look, whatever it is you're going through Gavin, you'll get through, man, you always came out. I can't watch you - Jesus Christ. - go down this road, man, what are you doing? Why the fuck are you laughing? Seriously, I'm trying to be serious with you. You always take everything so much harder than everyone else. We all got fucking problems, G! Seriously, bro, see this shit, you were never fucking happy, man. Even in Detroit, you bailed on us as soon as you got the gas money. - Happy with what? Huh? There was nothing for me there. You know what I wanted to do and you were supposed to have myback. - Didn't I? Didn't I have your fucking back,dude. Didn't you have me, didn't you have Nicole? - Don't fucking talk about Nicole, Marty. - Why shouldn't I? I was the one, I was the shoulder she cried on to try and convince me to get you to come back home. Did I ever even ask you or tellyou once? - I said don't fucking talk about her, okay? - Then you go and book a fuckingshow, me being the only moron that believes in you, and you throw all that away too. - I was depressed, okay? I didn't have anybody, I didn't have anyone. - I don't understand why you didn't come home, or why didn't ask anyone for help? - You had family. I wasn't gonna call Shane after what he did. I was supposed to come home with my tail between my legs. Fuck that. You all think it's some big party for me. I'm fucking dying, Marty. - That's not you, G. - I tweaked my back. I tweaked my back working out. That's it. My roommate at the time, he said, "Here, take one of these." I didn't know what it was, all I needed was an aspirin. It was Oxy. It's like 10 milligrams, that'snothing. But it made me happy. It made me happy when I had become content with being miserable. Fuck man, it doesn't happen like it does in the movies, it just happens, you know? - I'm trying to understand, man. Why tonight, G? - Fine, [cell phone ringing] fuck it. Hello? [crying] Goddammit Addie, what the fuck is wrong with you? - No fucking way, G, no way, pickles? - [Gavin] Yeah, Marty, pickles. - Holy shit. - Yeah, holy shit. - You know, not too long ago, maybe like a week ago, Hope asked me to go to the storefor her. She's not feeling too well lately and she used to do all the shopping so I went and kept thinking to myself, how does she do this, man, she's so good at this? And something so simple seemed hard because there's just so much going on in this grocery store. There's so many aisles, so many items, so many things. It's the same thing with pickles, G. There're a million pickles in the sea, man. You know what I mean? There're a million different kinds of pickles, all shapes and sizes, types. Short pickles, fat pickles, mutated pickles, crazy pickles. I didn't know how to be there for her. So, like a coward I ran in the basement and I just got hammered every night. I don't know how she didn't smell it on me, but she never gave me shit aboutit. Maybe she just smelled it, but didn't have the heart. We drink through the hard times,G. It's what we do, man, it's justa drink. You don't have to crash and burn over this. - That's what I do, Marty, I crash and burn. - That's not you, man. - How is Hope holding up, by theway? - She keeps a smile on throughout for the kids. - You never told Shane. - He's not really good with that sorta stuff. - Yeah, I know. [engine roaring] - Oh, great, he's here. - Look, Marty, I can see that you need a friend right now. I really am sorry to say, but tonight I'm not that friend,okay? [knocking on door] - Shane, you have the code, come on in, man. Oh Christ, let me get that, I'llbe back. - Marty, it's not Shane. - [Pouch] Hey, what's up bro? Is Gavin around? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, there's no Gavin here. I think you got the wrong room. - This is the address he gave me. - There's nobody here named Gavin, man. - Is that right? - Yeah, that's right. - Okay, sorry to have bothered you. What's your name? - You can call me whatever you wanna call me. Just as long as it's not Gavin, 'cause there's no Gavin here. - You know, I've been wanting to take a leak for like the last hour, is it okay if I use your bathroom though? - We gotta girl in here. - You know what, maybe she's gota friend? We can make a night of it, I do got the party favors, the party goods. - What do you say? - You know what, man? She's not really in a friendly mood. - Oh yeah? Why don't we let her decide? Hollywood! Yo Hollywood, Hollywood, there you go. - You got everything? - I sure do. - Yo, man, what the f, Gavin? Gavin? - You know the routine as long as you got the green. - Gavin, what's in that fucking pouch, bro? - Let your boy do his thing, man. Yo, let your boy do his thing, come here, come here. You said I could call you whatever I want, right? I think I'm gonna call you Scruffy. You know I have a little kid, he's beautiful. He comes to me, he goes,"Daddy, Bobby just got a doggy, "he can sit, he can stay, do you know what I'm gonna do "if I get a dog?" [suspenseful music] - [Gavin] You're always mad at me. - Not always. - My son's up all fucking night trying to teach this dog new tricks. You know what the dog's doing? - [Addison] Are you gonna do that all? - And I put them in my car and I take him off to the desert, I snap his fucking neck like a breadstick. - Scuba diving, no. - [Shane] Why not? - [Pouch] So shut the fuck up, and sit, and stay, Scruffy. - 'Cause I don't wanna have to trust anything. It ruins it, I wanna be downthere with no tank or anything. - [Shane] How are you gonna breathe? - [Addison] I'm gonna use a rock. - [Shane] Okay, use a rock to dowhat? - [Addison] You'll see. - [Shane] Oh yeah? - When I was a little girl on my island that I'm from there was this bridge that all the guys would go to and they would carry these big rocks and they would jump off of a bridge. And the rock would carry them all the way down to the bottom. They just stay there. [dramatic music] - [Marty] Gavin, Gavin, what the fuck are you doing, man? - [Pouch] Let's go over here, come on. - [Addison] 'Cause even if it's for a minute, it'll be worth it. - [Shane] What if you run outtaair? - That's the fun part. What if you run out of air? - Let's go Hollywood. - Gavin, I'm talking to you. - [Pouch] Sit and stay, Scruffy. - Gavin! Oh fuck. Gavin, buddy, it's Marty, man, what the hell? Where did you go? We're really worried about you,all right? So just give us a call back, please, bye. - Call the girl, he probably went to go find her. Hopefully he doesn't snap her neck. - I ordered her through a service, okay? They're not gonna give her number out that easily and I ordered a Filipino because I thought you guys wouldlaugh. - He didn't laugh though, Marty. - This isn't a fucking joke, bro, okay? He can get himself killed, that guy was fucking insane. - Do you still have the number to that service? - Yeah, why? It's right here. - Dial it. - I'm telling you right now they're not gonna give you the number. - She's not in a SecretService, bro, she's a stripper. Here, give me the phone. Hi, how you doing? Good, look, I just had a quick question for you. I was kinda hoping you'd beable help me out with something. Well, the thing is, you guys sent us this great stripper and, no, no, no, she was wonderful. I'm sorry, dancer. Sent us this amazing dancer, I know you guys don't like thatterm, but, she left a ring here and it looks really expensive and we just wanted to get it back to her before we took off in the morning. You would do that? Oh my God, that would be amazing. Well, here's the thing, I didn't catch her stage name, but she actually, she gave us her real name and it's... - Addie. - Addie, that's the one. Okay. Uh-huh. Got it, you're a lifesaver. Thank you so much. All right, yep, have a wonderful night, bye. Bunch a animals, they actually gave it to me. - Are you actually enjoying this? This is the fucking best mood you've been in all night, man. - Marty, this is what I do for aliving. I solve people's problems. Now here, we got the number, just give her a call. - It's not ringing, it's ringing, it's ringing. No voicemail. Do I have to leave a voicemail? Okay, I'll leave a voicemail. Addie, it's Marty, Gavin's friend. Yeah, I know it was really fucked up right now and it's a little confusing, but, Gavin just took off and we can'tfind him. We have no idea if he's okay. So just please call us back if you can when you see him? Okay? [sighing] Man. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck are you doing, man? - What? I'm hungry. - That's not yours to eat. - I gotta eat, Marty. - Do you even like pickles? - What's with the interrogation? - No, no, no, I'm just wondering, do you like pickles, man? - No, I don't, but I'm hungry so I don't really care. - Where did you go anyway? - What? - I just asked where you went, and I know you weren't fucking fishing. - I went for a drink, Marty, is that okay to do on my bachelor party in Vegas? - Really, just a drink, that's it? - Yeah, I had a drink, I played some cards, that's it. - Yeah, how'd you do, did you win anything? - I broke even. - Blackjack, poker? - Blackjack. I hit a double down for a couple100 and I dumped in a slot. - Don't fucking lie to me, dude. - [Shane] Why would I lie to you? - Because you would never put apenny in a fucking slot machine! So tell me exactly where the fuck you were. - What kinda celebration we having here? - You're gonna pull the victim card out now? You're gonna start sobbing? - I'm just being honest with you, Marty. How much fun are we having rightnow? - Oh, looks like you had a fucking jolly old time to me. - I did, I had a lotta fun. I had a drink, I played some cards, it was a blast. - You have a lot of fun with your intern back in New York? - Christ on a side car, Marty. I am not that guy. - No, no, you are exactly that fucking guy, man. Both of you are. You're both selfish and ungrateful and everything you have that you don't appreciate will be gone soon, trust me on that. - Oh my God. - And I suggest you call back home before I fucking smack you. - You want me to call Hope? Why would I call your wife? - Call home! - Marty, it's six o'clock in the morning in New York. Annabelle is sleeping, I'm not gonna wake her up. - Well, I would hope that you actually spoke to her before she fell asleep, 'cause if Hope's asleep I'm gonna leave a fucking message. - Oh my God. [knocking on door] Marty, he's back. [cell phone ringing] - [Shane] You've reached Shane at Pierce and Farmer please leave your name and phonenumber and I'll return your call. [answering machine beeping] - [Gavin] Yo, Shane, it's Gavin, what's going on man? It's been awhile. I just wanna say congrats. I am really happy you found old macadamia, or whatever, you know what I mean. Anyway, look man, I just, I wanted to talk to you about next weekend. I know it probably doesn't make a difference to you, and I don't know, maybe it does. Maybe that's why I'm calling, but, I can't do it, bro. I'm gonna fucking fall off if I go, I know it. I wanted to do this thing, I really fucking did. I got a girlfriend now. We met in rehab. I know it's fucked up, but I think I'd probably be deadby now if she wasn't there for me so... Oh, she's fucking hot too, bro. You would fucking die, you will love this one. And you remember that time we went downtown like eight nights in a row to shoot dice 'til like 6:00 a.m.? We lied to Marty 'cause he kept giving us shit about having a problem. I wish that was my only fuckingproblem. We lost so much money. We probably should have listenedto him a little bit more. Man, I miss you guys. Oh fuck! [answering machine beeping] - [Automated Voicemail] Todelete this message press seven. [beeping] - So, how was your night? [whistling] - What are you looking at? - Could you pretend to give a fuck for once? - I do give a fuck, Marty. What do you want me to do? It's not exactly a big surprise I don't know what he was thinking coming here. - For you! - No, no, the record will show that Vegas was your idea. Yeah, what, before he almost fucking died? - Well, he didn't have to come. - You're still ashamed of what you did. - Ashamed? Marty, how many times do I have to apologize? He either forgives me where he doesn't, I can't go back in time. - I don't understand how you could make it seem like he fucked your girlfriend instead of the other way around like it actually fucking happened. - Okay Marty, let's just drop it. Yeah, let's drop it. You know what? Let's just talk about your intern. - What do you want me to say, Marty? What, that I slept with my intern? Fine, you got me. I slept with my intern, I cheat on my fiance. Does that make you happy, are you're good now? Huh, you heard what you wanted to hear? Jesus Christ, man. It's not exactly something I'm proud of. - Well then stop fucking doing it. - Screw you Marty. Hmm? Screw you, and fuck Gavin. Okay. I'm always under such a magnifying glass with you too. It's like whenever he screws up, he's some poor little innocent victim. But whenever I screw up, I'm a fucking monster. - You know what? No, I fully fucking acknowledgethat you are both selfish, ungrateful, fucking assholes, the only difference is Gavin hurts himself. You hurt everyone else around you! And your head is so far up your own fucking ass, man, you haven't once asked if Ineed anything or how I'm doing. - Fine. How you doing, Marty, do you need anything? - What, from you? No, I learned not to haveexpectations with you years ago! And how the fuck am I? Not so great, Shane. Hope's about to be back in chemo. And yet I'm still here suffering for you two guys. - Wait, Hope's back in chemo? - Oh, don't try and play that fucking friend card with me. It's never been in your deck. - You've never said anything to me about this. No, no, no, no, wait! - [Marty] All I wanted was some fucking French toast. - Marty! - Pumpkin pie. Remember? It was your first day out and I came to pick you up. I mean, if you think about it, it was our real first date. I asked, so what you wanna do? You were so freaking cute and soserious. I remember you said, "Pumpkin pie, you down, pumpkinpie?" Do you remember what I said? I said. - Pie not? - Mm-hmm. We went to the farmer's market and you kept trying to eat frommy half and I kept swatting you away. - It wasn't fair. Your half was bigger than mine. - Oh, yeah. - You cut it uneven. You wanted wine so bad. - Yeah. - You remember what I said? - Why not, baby? - Why not, baby? - And I said, you can't have one, baby. Not today, anyway. You know we all have our demons,Gavin. The trick is having one that won't kill you. - Addie. Addie. - [Addie] What? - Addie. - [Addie] What? - Addison. - [Addie] What? Gavin, calm down. - I am calm, baby. - What? [crying] What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? - I don't know. I don't know. - Oh, baby. [soft music] - I love you. - I know, I know. - I do love you, Addie, I do love you. [Gavin crying] [soft music] - Baby. [Gavin retching] [crying] Hey. - Hey. - What'd you take, Gavin? - I'm not puking from the drugs, I don't puke from the drugs anymore. - What'd you take? - I had a little whiskey. - What else? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Mm-mm. - Pills? - Yeah, pills. - Fuck. What else? - You. Addie. - Yeah? - I have to tell you something. - What? - I didn't go to San Francisco. [laughing] - No shit! So what do you wanna do tomorrow? Pumpkin pie? - I don't know. [groaning] [sighing] - [Shane] Answer the phone, dickhead. Yo, G, pick up the phone bro, seriously. For the record, Gavin, you have absolutely ruined thisweekend. Christ, man, you are such an ass. I hope you're happy in there all passed out, goddammit, what happened to us? I know what happened to us, I was a shit friend. I am a shit friend. Look man, I'm sorry. Not for Nicole, for not being there, for not hopping on a plane and picking your ass up from fucking rehab, for everything. - [Gavin] Thanks. - [Shane] You okay? - I think my hand modeling career's over. - You gonna be able to jerk off with that thing? - I'll figure something out. Where's Marty? - [Shane] Out looking for new childhood friends. - Sounds about right. Really? - Really. - If you could go back in time to any one day, what day would it be and why? "I'd of told you about Nicole." [Gavin chuckling] You wouldn't go back and not sleep with her? That's a shitty use of time travel, Shane. - No, I would not go back and not do it because I don't think you would've ever let her go if that never happened. - Oh, so you did me a favor. - That's not what I'm saying, Gavin, I just think you're better off. - It wouldn't have mattered if you had told me. It wouldn't have made a difference, for the record. - You wouldn't have respected the fact that I owned up to it? - No, I wouldn't have respectedthe fact that you owned up to it. - I would have at least respected myself. I haven't really respected myself since then. - I haven't really respected you since then either, so. Come on, man, I'm fucking with you. - I'm trying to apologize to you, Gavin. - That was before doing something shitty made me feel bad. I don't feel anything. I wanted to be that guy growingup. The guy in the movies that goeshome and turns down the girl at the bar, and crawls into bed and kisses his wife goodnight and says he loves her. He calls her on the phone when he's in the car just to sing her stupid songs and hear her laugh. He writes her poems on her birthday. I wanted to be that guy growingup. - Well, that guy sucks. - Does he? I'm trying to have a serious conversation with you here, man. - No, I'm being serious, that guy sucks. I don't know what you want me to say, Shane. I don't know why you're asking me. - Because you're my friend. - Of all people. We all got bugs, you know, it'sfine. You got air in your lungs. - I know what you mean, we've got different bugs. - We all got our demons, baby. Just because yours won't kill you doesn't mean you don't have to fight it. She's the one? - What? Yeah, of course she's the one. - Start today, be that guy. It's worst things that are done,Shane. - You don't think I should comeclean, tell her what I've done? - No, I don't think you should come clean to her. Go home, get married, be happy. - You don't think that's a little fucked up? - I think fucked up is relative. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - I'm seriously asking. - Well, my hand is probably broken, Shane. - I'm not talking about your hand. - I punched that wall, you know, I did that. I chose to do that. - That's a strange response. - Well, maybe, but it doesn't change the fact that my fucking hand hurts. - It's a consequence. - And there's no sense in pretending it's fine. You just, I don't know, tape it up or something and keep moving. - You're gonna need some ice too. - Some ice too. What do you think, should we gofind him? - Yeah. Yeah, we should. Give me a minute though. I'm gonna call my fiance. - Hey. - [Shane] Yeah? - I told you she was hot. - [Shane] Yeah. Yeah, you did. - [Faith] I see that. It's really cool. - That's all Cgs, and computer effects, and all that crazy shit. - [Faith] Wow. - Yeah, I brought it out here actually to have him sign it from my son. Got a little four-year-old boy here. - Oh my God, he's cute. - Oh yeah, he's a little maniac, let me tell you. - Well let me tell you, you'd better enjoy him while he's a little maniac. - Why, you got a couple of big maniacs? - Oh yeah, I have a big maniac and he's a big enough maniac to go around for everybody. - Well I'm sure he'll grow out of it. I can't tell you the hell I put my mom through. - Well, that would be pretty hard to do from prison. - Oh, I'm not really good atresponding to things like that. - Don't worry about it, it's okay. - If you don't mind me asking, what happened? - No, I don't mind. He's in for murder. - I'm sorry. - It's okay, don't worry about it. I mean, it's not really a fresh wound, you know? I don't wanna ruin your breakfast. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, you'refine. My friends already did a numberon my day. So tell me, he actually killed someone? - Yeah, he did, he actually killed someone. - Wow, was it an accident? - No, he stabbed him. But I'm proud of him now. - Why, that's a little fucked up? - No, I'm not proud of himbecause he stabbed him, you ass. I'm proud of him because he's written a book. - Good, 'cause I was about to ask for this coffee to go. - It's called "Two Ways To Go West." It's pretty cool. It's like a Western about this rancher who has this murderous past. And the bad guys come in and they like burn his farm. So, he heads West to take revenge. But really, the story is within the journey because then he realizes that he's better off not killingthem and he finds this inner peace. - Wow, how does it end? [door bell chiming] - Your buddies? - Yeah, if you can call them that, that's them. - Let me get your food, it was nice talking to you. You seem like one of the good guys. - I'm trying. - [Faith] Hey guys. - [Gavin] Hey. - [Faith] Coffee? - [Shane] Yes, please. - [Faith] You got it. - Alright, listen, pal, I'm detective Johnny McNabb and this is my partner. - Detective Shit For Brains. - Yeah. - So what happened in this episode, boys? Did you two finally manage to wipe your own asses yet? - Actually, I learned that Ican't solve the case on my own, I need my partners to have my back detective. - Detective McDouchebag, right? - Well, I learned, I learned... Can I? - Oh, now you wanna see it? - [Gavin] Yeah. - Well, I've been waiting for you to sign it. - Jesus. - Bring back memories? - Yeah, a little bit. Learned a few things. Don't forget where you come from. - Sounds like a pretty shitty episode to me. - Yeah, maybe so, but, I really think it will get the show back on the right track. - Yeah. - You know, - I keep thinking that, but it always winds up being the same bullshit every time. - Give it another shot. - At this point I'm stuck with it, I'm too old for a new show. - There's nothing else good on anyway. It's all shit one way or another. - What do you say, Marty? We try again? - As fun as you two are to be around. I miss Hope and the kids. - [Faith] Here you go. - Oh, thank you so much. - [Faith] You're welcome. - Thank you. - [Faith] What could I get you guys? - I'll have the French toast. - [Faith] You got it, and you? [sighing] - I will have the French toast too, please.
