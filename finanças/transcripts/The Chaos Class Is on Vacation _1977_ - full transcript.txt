Even the children started to be teachers now. -Hey, you! What's this whistle? You're doing this for everything. -Give it to me! -Go on! -Thank you, children! -Oh, shit! -Are they playing football? -No. They're playing backgammon. -I think you're new? -Yes.

You shouldn't do it again! -How can Mahmut Beg understand that we'll have a match? -He's a holy man. He feels it. -Don't you know? He started to teach again just to deal with the Hababam. -I think he doesn't like you. -If you don't cut this mustache he won't like you, too. -My dear Domdom, can I have a cigarette? -Is here a market? Go to another door! -You, Cow, when will you stop being a sponger? -Hey, The one with mustache has one! - Thanks man. - -Is it right to smoke in school guys? -Look who's saying this! I can see yours in your pocket! -What, you're telling us you don't smoke?- -Look, here's a Hababam advice for you. Smoke a dozen cigarettes if you want but don't let Mahmut Beg catch you. -He's telling the truth. And, you better cut off your moustache. - -Hey! Kid! Where are you going? You can't come here with these clothes. This is teacher's room! -Ok, I'm a teacher! -Teacher? What? - Come in! - -Mahmut Beg! Please! -Hey, you! Didn't you find another place to put on? -Did you talk to me? -Yes, to you. -Where should I put on? -Here is teachers' room, not dormitory! Why are you here? -The same reason as you are. -Hey, you! Be polite! Get out! -Why should I get out? -Bring me a coffee,too. -OK. -He'd smoke if he won't be ashamed! -I would, but my friends took them. -Don't make me stand up, you idiot! -What if you do stand up? -I'll beat you very well! -Will you do it? -If you keep on being rude, yes! -Mahmut Beg! Please, don't get nervous! You've heart disease!You can have a crisis. -It's OK.Don't worry! Take your places! -You, bastard! -Please don't get hurt but you're really so much what the children say. -Get out I said! And don't enter any class with this mustache! -Noone can touch my mustache! -I can! -In this school none of our students can have mustache! -These rules are for the students not for me. -Who are you, man? -I'm literature teacher. -Literature teacher? -Yes, the new literature teacher. -Why didn't you say before? -You didn't ask. If you ask instead of shouting you'd learn. -Eat him, eat! -Let's eat him! -Take of your hand! -Domdom! -Good morning! -Shut up, we've got to do something!-Go on! Go on! -Children! -What do you say, mustache? -What are you doing? -We're electing the representative! -Leave it, you've lesson now! -Don't be afraid! -OK,children, let's sit down! -We've someone between us who wants to be representative. -Yes, Domdom, you're right. -No. -Yes,! You look like so. -I can't be representative! -Why? If your arm is strong you can do it. -OK, let's do it. -Look at the match! -Go on, front seats! -Hafize! -Yes, Mahmut Beg! -Is Hababam's lesson free? -I don't know but if it's Pasha Nuri's lesson they're making fun of it. -I don't think so. This doesn't look like a fun of Mr. Nuri. -Hey, you! -You're the shame of the Hababam class. -What's happening here? -They're doing arm wrestling, Mahmut Beg! -Yes, please! Do you want anything? -Oh, you're here! I thought it's a free lesson. -No, I'm here, Mahmut Beg! -I thought you're literature teacher. -I am. Do you have any objection? -Yes, there's very much noise. -The things that happen in this class is none of your business. -It is if there's noise. -The responsibility belongs to me when I am in this class. -And the discipline of the school belongs to me. -Sure, but I don't like being disrupted during the lesson. -Now, please leave me alone with my students! -OK. -Let's to your places, children! -Okay, sir! -Unbelievable! He's a teacher! -He's literature teacher on top of it! -He's a real teacher! -Forgive us, sir! We didn't understand! -We didn't know that you're a teacher! -It's not important. A teacher should be close to his students. -Yes, sir! -It's totally true! -They should be friends. -Let's be friends,sir! -Come! We're here! -Listen! Mistakes belong to the teacher not to the students. -Sure. I can't stand, hold me! -Why?-I'll go and kiss him! Can I kiss you? -I'll be your friend. And I'll insist being like that till the end. -Please, sir, do always like this! -He's not a teacher, an angel! -Yes, angel! God bless you! -We wish Mahmut Beg would be like you! -I think you're not doing well with Mahmut Beg? -He's the only enemy of us! -He treats us very bad. -Really? -Very very bad! -He beats us! -He beats you?! -Yes, very badly! -You should see him! -He beats us the whole day! -He doesn't give us food! -He doesn't give us water! -He gives very bad punishments to us! What else? -Unbelievable! There are still such teachers around! I want to say something to you, children,.. .. I didn't like this Mahmut Beg,either! -Me, too! -Back to our lesson now! -Come here, come on! Take place! -Mahmut Beg! -Yes, Mr. Principal! -Please register these new students! -Excuse me, sir? -Didn't you understand? I said registration. -But they're girls! -Doesn't matter! I decided to accept girls to my school this year. -Okay, but how? -We have to, Mahmut Beg! We have to! Otherwise we should close this shop. We need money! -Each student means money. You know we have the claim of discharging as a headache. If he brings money to us I'll accept even my father as a student. So far four students, all of them.. .. are for the last class of literature. -Impossible! Will they be with my students? -Your students? -I mean 'Hababam'. -Yes, they will. I'm sure that the girls will help our lazy boys with their behavior. -Please register them and send them to their class! -OK, let's do it! -Now you see the last wonder of the technology! -Balloons with cows! -We hope they'll be good for our country. -Saban will go crazy about them! -Be quiet! He's coming. -Oh, balloons! Very nice! -Look, Saban,we bought for you! -Thank you so much! -What is this? -You tell us. -I'll... -Möö.. -You,Fatty! Did you do these cows? You, bloody Fat! -Why do you hit me, Cow? Domdom did it! -It's a lie,Saban! -You bloody Domdom!You'll see! You, bastard! -Keep calm, my dear Cow, keep calm! -Don't hold me! I'll kill him! -What's going on? Take your seats! Go on! -This year our principal accepted girls to our school and unfortunately they're all senior students of literature. -In this case they'll have to study in this class. Now, listen to me carefully. -You want to have good relations with these new students. But do not go too far in these relations! -I don't know if I can explain it. I'll always keep an eye on you! -Now, go two rows back! Saban! Saban! Don't sleep! -And you go this side! -Now introduce yourself to one another! -God, is this a dream! -Tell me is this the real life? -I can't believe my eyes! -I'll die! -Fatty, something is happening to me. -It's happened to me already! -Hi! I want to introduce myself. My name is Ayse. -And my name is Filiz. -I'm Sevtap! -And my name is Sevda! -Let's introduce ourselves! -Ok, let's do it! -My name is Ìsmail! -Wait, I'll introduce myself first! -Leave me! -Saban! -I'm the representative of the class. -Go aside!

My head! -Which one of you has broken my eyeglasses? -Hey, you,be careful! You've hurt me! -Domdom, how are you hitting me? Look at my eye! -What can I do? You've biten my ear. -Ah, tell me, who's hit at my waist? -I did it! What will you do? -Try it again if you can! -Don't push me to do it! Ah, my waist! -Stop it! It's enough! You fought badly for a couple of girls! -They don't look like good, either! Shame on you! Where is your character of being' Hababam class'? -'Hababam class' -I thought it's something. -They're small kids! All of them are stupid! -I did two tricks, they went crazy! -Did you see the fat one? He was nearly in my mouth! -This year we'll have fun! -We'll make good fun of these stupid boys! -Girls, I've seen many schools before but I've never seen so many stupid boys all together. -Me, too. -Look at us! We're killing ourselves. -You're right! 'Fighting' doesn't suit the 'Hababam'! -Yes! We behaved badly! -Because of our own silly behaviors! -Right!-We can handle this in a 'Hababam's way. -How? -Very easy. How many girls are there? -Let me count.. one,two,three.. four! -How many people are there in Hababam? -Let me count.. one,two,three.. -If we count also the Cow we're twenty-eight. -Bastard! I'll beat you! -This means for every girl there are seven boys. -For which girl which seven people? -Exactly we'll select this! -How shall we do the selection? -We'll draw lots! -I've got it! Everyone of these seven people will try to deceive the girl in his group! -Yes! And no flirting with the other group's girls! Let's bring the black board! -I'm saying the seventh one for Filiz! -Come on! -Do it without any trick! -Fatty Hayri! -Ooo! Well done! -Dear Domdom, why don't you mention my name? -Because the cows don't belong to this selection. -Don't push me to swear to your whole family! -Don't get nervous, Saban! We're about to finish. -Hey, you, go on! -I'm drawing the last one for Sevda! Naughty Ìsmail! -Lucky Naughty! -Domdom, my name still doesn't exist? -Be patient!

Its obvious that you've studied! -Zero to all Hababam and 10 to you! Mahmut Beg, I see that Hababam is on single foot again. -In this way, they won't stand with both! -Have the girls begun nastiness as well? -You can't part one from the other! -One who comes to this class degenerates. -What have they done again, sir? -They've put laxative to the meal of the girls and the girls have done a worse thing. -So the boys have made a war in the school. -If it's Hababam it's possible. -If they do that I'll do this! -We're disgraced in front of the school. -Hababam has no more honor. -We're humiliated, too. -Mahmut Beg has the fault! -He's killed us! -When has he done something good? -We're quilty. -Why? -Because we've forgetten our major enemy and made the war between us. -Right. We've made everything easier for Mahmut Beg. -There is only one solution. To unite against Mahmut Beg! -Yes, girls, are you with us in uniting against the enemy? -How shall we trust you? -We can't trust you! -Let's forget the hatred! -Let's say we understand each other. How shall we revenge on Mahmut Beg? -You can't know. Boys, what's the most important thing Mahmut Beg go crazy for? To run away for the match! -He really goes crazy. -He looses himself. -OK,let's get ready! We're going to the match of Galatasaray-Fenerbahce! -How shall we run away from this prison? -We'll not run away! We'll go outside from the front door. -How? -We'll go with the trumpets and drums! -Are we gonna go to the army? -No, we'll be boy scouts! -Don't stand like that! Quick! Jump! Jump! No, you can't! You can't! -Sir, how do we jump? -You can do it very well, keep on! -No, not like that!

Come on, don't break our hearts! -All right, 5 of you lay right there. -Ok sir! -Here! Here! -Why I couldn't make it? Because they don't know how to stand!-Stand up! Stand up! -Get well soon, sir!-Oh, it's not a big deal, it's just a small accident. -Sir! -What? -Actually you really hurt us. -What happened? -Why did you hide it from us, sir?-Hide what? -That you were a scout! Right?-Was I? -Yes, we've found it out! You became a scout when you were a little boy! - I was a scout since that time.. -Being a scout was your life then. -We heard you have medals. -You have records. -Yeah! -It was.. I know everything about being a scout. -We admire you sir! -We wish we could be a scout too.. -We wish we had a teacher like you are. -We would be the kings of scouts! -The whole world would know our name. -Think about it sir! Mr. Ekrem and his truckers! -You're the head of us.. -And we're walking! -Alright! We're making a trucker team! -My children! -What's up?-What is this noise? -I don't know. Hey Mahmut Beg! -Join us, sir! Join us! -What are these clothes, Mr. Ekrem?-I'm a scout sir! -Oh, since when?-Since now sir. -Were you a scout before?-They say I was, sir! -So what are you doing now?-I'm preparing my kids! -Can you just work out a little bit far? -They're having lessons in the classrooms right now. It could be a little bit noisy because of you.. -Ok sure Mahmut Beg. Ok kids, let's move! -We're going a little far. One, two! One,two! -Sir. -What kid? -We make a lot of noise here too. -Yeah, we do! What should we do? -Let's go outside the school. That way people can watch your brave scouts. -Ok, let's get out! To left! Left! -Left! Left! Right! Left! -Open the door Mr. Veysel!-Waow. Where are you going dressing up like that? -I'll take a walk with my kids. -Come on! Left right left! Left! Left! Left right left! -Turn to right! -Turn left! -Stop! -Where are they?-Who are you looking for Mr. Ekrem? -Where are my kids? -Fener! Fener! -Fener! Fener! -Heey! Woohoo! Galatasaray! -They're just saying "Galatasaray" because they want to make us angry. -They're girls, man. They're always a problem! -Fener! Fener! -I wonder what is Mr. Ekrem doing right now? -What could he do? He's probably looking for us all over the Istanbul! -No, I think he already told Mahmut Beg that he has lost us. -Mahmut Beg is probably waiting for us on the stairs! -Maybe he'll miss us and come to the match! -Fener! Fener! -Mahmut Beg! -Yeah that's what I'm saying. -He's here! -Don't be silly, he doesn't even know this place! -He's behind you! -I don't buy it! -Mahmut Beg is probably having a shock at school. -Saban!-What? -Why are you looking at me so weird? Someone else would think Mahmut Beg is behind you! -Saban!-What? Wow, Mahmut Beg! Hi! -I was just talking about you. -Let's go! We're turning back to school. -Go to your seats! Sit down. -Mahmut Beg! Congratulations, you caught us pretty well. Right? -So, you became a scout to go to the match. -What? Why would we do something like this? -The most important thing for us is being a scout, not the match. -Yeah, yeah. -So you really like being a scout? -Like? We love being a scout! Right guys? -We're born to be scouts! -Girls, are you born to be scouts too? -Yes, of course! -Being a scout is in our blood. -My dad was the head of soldiers. -Sir. Mine was too. -Good. So I have good news for you. -What's that Mahmut Beg? Shh! I think he's gonna give us medals. -You're camping this weekend. -What camp sir? -You don't know that scouts go camping, sleep in tents,wake up early in the morning and go for a walk? -But Mahmut Beg! It's winter now. We can't camp in winter! -We'll freeze! -We'll be really cold! -The wolves would eat us. -We can't study our classes. -You better kill us. -What kind of punishment is that? -No, no not punishment. I didn't even think of a punishment. Besides there's no summer or winter for a scout. If you really like beinga ascout, then.. -.. I'm sure you'll enjoy camping. Come on! Be quick! Come on! Quick! -Who did this? -scouts are quick! -Quick scouts. scouts are fast! -Who's fast? Come on! Walk! -Maybe we should take t slow. -Look at Mahmut Beg! He's almost dancing with happiness! -Sir, pray for us. -Why? -We're gonna camp. We could not return alive! -We could not find the way back. -I wish! -Hurry! Hurry! -Please let's take it slow sir. -What kind of a scout you are? -Our stuff can break. -Is everybody's in? -Yes, sir! -And I am also in! Yes, we are going! I'll be dead if we go more! We can't stand anymore! -Stop scouts! -Yes, sir? And this is our camping place. Let's work to construct the tents! Who stretched this rope? You idiot! Will I beat you? Stretch! -Kids, will you help us? -We don't. Help yourselves! You pigs! Let me help you! -We'll start with driving stakes. This is a stake. -It's not something else, is it? -We should do it carefully otherwise you can hit your hand -He hit his hand. -Why are you laughing at the teacher? -I'll stand under it and you'llmake the tent! -It's not okay. -Everything has happened to us because of Mahmut Beg. -Take it Mother Hafize! -Get away! -Get away! -Why are you hitting me? -Aa, sir! -You, animal! -Allah! -Thank you! -Hold it! -Give it! -Take that loudspeaker! -Give that cord! -Take it! -There is something wrong with this tent but.. -Saban! -What? -Look who is here! Yours! -Is Ayse here? Oh, dear! -Are you again? You've followed me after the bus. Leave me alone! He doesn't understand any word. -He won't. What's it? -Please go otherwise they'll gossip about us. -Oh God, she doesn't go! -Gather around me! -My boy scouts! -Yes. -At the end we've managed to build up our tent. Now we'll give a name to this honorable tent. -What kind of a name should it be, sir? -Here my name is scoutmaster, not teacher. -Yes, scoutmaster. -Yes Saban, scoutmaster. I'm the scoutmaster and you're the head of the tent. -Yes,I undersand. I'm the head you're the body. -Don't make me crazy! I'm the scoutmaster, you're the head of the tent! -I'm saying the same thing! -Scoutmaster, what's the name of our tent? -Scouts choose the name of an animal for themselves. -Can it be a big one? -Sure. But the animal should live in Turkey. -Is it okay if it has horns? -Oh, it's not OK, is it? -No,it's okay. -Why? -Can we choose it from the ones which gives us milk? -No, you can't. -Yes, they can. -Is it possible that it says "Möö"? -No, it's impossible! -It's possible! -Then the name is 'Cow Tent'! -No! -Scoutmaster, we prepared our flag. -Let me see. What, it's me! You idiot! -Saban! -What? -Yes! Our tent's name is Cow Tent! -Wish it brings us luck! -Scoutmaster? -Yes. -Isn't there an other way to make a fire? -Scouts make a fire like this. A scout should try the opportunities in his hand. -But you're trying to make a fire for an hour, sir!-We're freezed, scoutmaster! -It can happen soon! -Scottmaster?-Saban! It's Scoutmaster! -Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Scoutmaster. I know an other way. Can I try? -Really? I don't think it's gonna work. But try. -Were you here?-I was here. -If you want it that much, here! A kid will teach me my job! Funny! -It's burning Scottmaster. -Good work, scout. Tell me how did you make it?-It's very easy sir. With this! -A match! -I'm freezing so bad. -My teeth are shaking, Ican't help it! -We'll show you, Mahmut Beg! You killed us!-He didn't have any feelings! -Feelings? Mr. Mahmut? -He would cut out our skin if he could! -He would cook us for meal! -I can't talk because of the cold! -It's really cold! -Guys, it I die, tell my father that I died like a hero because of that bold Mahmut Beg! -Don't be stupid! -Scoutmaster! -Scottmaster. -We'll freeze! -Don't think about the cold. Don't forget!scouts don't fell the cold. They don't feel cold of hot. -Look at me am I cold?-He's shaking. -He's almost gonna freeze! -Why I'm not cold? Because, I erased the cold from my head with the kung -fu technics. -Can we erase the hot too, scoutmaster? -Same thing. I wouldn't feel hot if I wanted to! -So, I mean a fire wouldn't even make you hot?-Never! -Wouldn't it burn?-It can't do anything unless I want to! -Wouldn't this fire burn you?-No! It can't even touch my skin. -I can walk with my bare foot on this fire! -Then prove us that it doesn't burn. -Now?-Right now sir. -I'll show you some other day if you want. -No. We want it now. -They say now. -Ok then, I'll do it. Alright. -Let me help you. -His feet are smelling! -Careful! So we dealled with this one. -What happened scoutermaster? -I think my feet burned! -Guys! -Where are you going?-Shh! We're bringing some tea to the girls. -Are they really secret drinks? -I put some drugs inside. We'll make four of them sleep and then we'll throw them to the lake. -The lake? Be careful noone should hear. There could be secret agents here. -All he's thinking about is secret agents nowadays! -Girls! -Who are you? -It's me. Your handsome secret agent Saban. -What Saban? -Danger! These jerks will bring you some tea with drugs in it, and then they'll throw you to the lake when you sleep! -Thanks, my handsome secret agent. -I'm a good one, right? They're coming! -Girls? -Come in! -We want to be friends with you. That's why we bring you some tea. -Aww, thanks! -We thought you're cold. -Thank you. -Thanks guys. -Good night! -We'll be dead if Saban didn't warn us! -They have drugs and we don't? -They'll fall in their own hole! Where are these candies?-Here. -Let's put some drugs inside them. -Guys. -Come in Ayse. -We're really touched by your sweet attitude a few minutes ago. That's why, I bring you some candies for me and my friends. -Thanks! You can take some more tea if you want. -No thanks, we're really tired. We'll go to sleep. -We'll go to sleep right now for some reason. Good night! -Good night! -Let's eat! -Isn't it delicious? -The cow tent! Wake up! -Everyone will meet us under our flag in a minute!-Be quick! -Hurry! Hurry! scouts wake up early. -scouts don't even sleep! -What kind of a scout you are? Up! Walk! -Run! Faster! A scout doesn't walk, he runs! -Hurry up! Hurry up kids! -scouts protect their younger ones! Hurry! Be quick! -scouts like the order! scouts are fast and quick! -Scouts do everything in an order! -They protect their younger ones and respect theri older ones! Hurry up! -Why didn't you wear your trousers, kid?-Ok? -What happened? -We went to the lake to wash our faces. -Then our foot slipped, we fell down to the lake. -We were so sleepy sir! -Didn't you wake up already?-that's so weird. -Did you take drugs or something? -Dress up quickly! We're going on a walk. -But sir, we haven't had breakfast yet! -We're so hungry. -You'll eat on the way. -What can we eat when we're camping?-Right Ayse? -Saban, a scout eats what he finds, not hopes! -Plants are our friends and enemies. -Careful! -Scouts make their bread with stones. They eat what they find! They even eat nothing! -They die from hunger! -For example, this is a plant root. It's turnip-root. -Its taste is delicious, it's good for the brain and includes A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H vitamins. -I think it's alphabet not a plant! -You can eat it. It's very sweety. Like this! -It's very bitter! Then it's not turnip! -You know girls have persuaded us. -How did they understand that we put something into the tea? -In the same way as they've understood the laxative in the compote!-How? -We've an agent in between us. He tells everthing to the girls. -Are you serious? -Who can it be? -It can be Saban! -Right! Only Saban knew that we brought tea with medicine to the girls last night. -What a jerk!-Jerk cow! -Let's go, he's gonna pay for this! -He will. When we go back to the camp! -What are they talking about? -They're after a trick again. -They can think of numerous tricks. My dear Saban tells me everything. -My God! It follows me the whole day! -Stop it! Please do not follow me! -Okay, you love me but they gossip about us. -Don't make me nervous! I'll cut and eat you! -We should be careful about the plant we eat and about the animal, too. For example, you can eat lizard. -Can we eat this horse,too, sir? -No, this is a saddle horse, you can't eat! -Bravo, sir! You know horses very well. -Yes, I know. I used to be on the horses in my childhood. -He's lying. -I can train the wildest animal. -Can you ride this horse? -It looks like a scabby animal but.. Let's try! -Help me! -Yes, sir! -My God! -Don't laugh! Don't laugh! Help me again! -The scoutmaster runs away! -What are you doing, my dear friends? -A bomb! -A bomb? What will you do with this bomb? -We'll totally solve the problem. -Tonight we'll bomb the girls! -Really? My God! -Yes, but nobody should know this. -Right! A spy can hear this. Be careful! -Excuse me, I'm going. Have a nice day! I'm running. -OK! Let's put the microphone into the girls' tent! -Be quiet! Girls're coming! -Girls, I'm here! -What's up,Saban? Tell us. -Girls, you're at the end. Hababam will bomb you tonight! -They're real jerks! -Yes, they are! -They're murderers! -All of them! -You can expect everything from them. I like none of them. They're dirty men and a little bit stupid, too. -You're at our side, aren't you, Saban? -Sure! -What happened to my voice? It's as if it comes from outside. I'm going, girls! Our stupid guys shouldn't understand anything. -Bye, my dear spy! -Bye! -My God! -Don't leave him! Catch him! -Come here, you coward! -Leave me! Leave me! -Cow is caught in the act. We should listen to the witnesses. -Where are the witnesses? -Witness Ayse! Witness Sevda! Witness Filiz! Witness Sevtap! -Dear magistrates! Here are the witnesses who will tell the truth. Help me, girls! -We're listening to you, witnesses! -We've nothing to do with this trial. -What? Tell the truth! -Saban has come to us and said that he likes none of his friends, all of them should die. Then he has told all your secrets to us. -Is this true? -Yes, it is! -No, have I said this? Impossible! I've no idea about this! -Cow Saban, you're the suspect! Defend yourself and we'll hang you! Go on! -I'm innocent. This is a sad love story. They've deceived me. I'm telling this for the first time. These girls've seen my attractiveness.. -and run after me. Don't you know what love is? I'm victim of lust. My God! -Oh, my God! -Let's kill this cow! -I'm dead in any case! Please, don't! -He'll die if we frighten him a bit more. -That's enough for him! -I'm declaring the decision! We give up with the death penalty because the suspect is a cow and is deceived.. .. by the girls because of his wild attractiveness. -Oh, my dear! He'll forgive me! -The penalty will be given to Saban in a manner just for the cows. We've decided to make a cow meat stew from him! -Boys! Shall I be a 'stew'? -Yes, stew with cow meat! -I don't like it! Is it possible to make something else out of me? -No, you'll be cow stew! -Oh! -This meal needs salt. -And the meat is too hard. It isn't cooked well. Where are the potatoes of this stew? -Children, Mahmut Beg! -What happened to Mahmut Beg? -He's coming. -Poor Cow, he sees halucinations because of fear! -He's coming with the fat inspector. -Don't believe him! He has a new trick! -He's coming closer, closer. -Children! -He's here! -Mahmut Beg! -Welcome, Mahmut Beg! -Where is Mr. Ekrem? -A horse's run away with him. -What? He's run away with a horse? -No. A horse has run away with him. -What are you doing here? -Whom are you talking about? -Is there anybody else exept you? Let me see. Oh, no! -I said what are you doing here? -Where? -In this thing!-In this thing? -No, in a something else!-Why should I be in a something else? -Who are you?-I'm a stew. -What stew? -Cow stew. -Cow stew? -Yeah but I should have more salt. -What salt?-Salt of the stew. I told told them though. -You told what? -I would be a better steak. -Didn't they make you one? -No. They kept saying that I should be a stew. -You can't be a stew!-No I can't! But they don't understand! -You can't be a steak either! -I can. I would be a really good one. -No way! -Way! -I said no way! No way! A cow can't be a stew or a steak! Besides, how one dares to call you a stew? You have no salt, and the patatoes are not cooked enough.. -... and tell me where's this stew's onions? -The inspector thing is done guys. -I won't accept a stew without onions as a stew! First you'll cut the onions to thin pieces. Then you'll put them in the salt. Then you'll... -put it onto the the beef, I mean onto the steak! -Um.. Mahmut Beg why did we come here? -Excuse me, I gotta go again! -I see you're not very happy about your new lives? -Is this called a life sir! -We're don! We're ruined! -You'd better send us to the war! -So you didn't learn your lesson from this camp life? -We can learn a lesson in the school sir! -This is a school too guys. -What kind of a school is this? -It is. A school is not only a place with 4 walls an a roof. A school could be everywhere. It can be a forest, it can be.. -.. a mountain. Where there's education and knowledge, there's a school. -But sir, what can we learn in this school? -To live, to survive, to fight with the nature..

Who hanged you?-Who could it be, Mahmut Beg! -Mahmut Beg huh? -Yeah. He punished us. -He tried to hagn them from their throats, but we didn't let him! -What he did is ridiculous! Let your friends come down! Go to your class! It's time to deal with this... -Mr. Avni will.. bald Mahmut... You know! -What do you think you're doing, Mahmut Beg! -What do you mean? -How could you give such a punishment to these guys?-I know how to punish them. -You can't! -I can! -What you did isn't a human thing to do!-Speak carefuly with me! -You're an emotionless, cruel man! You hate students! I'm ashamed of having the same job with you! -Enough! You don't say things that you'll be embaressed in the future. -I'm gonna expell you from this school! -You'll see what hanging a student from his feet is!-Hanging them from their feet? -Don't deny it! 3 students were hanging there from their feet!-Did they tell you that it was me? -Yes. -And you believed them, right? -Of course. Wait, didn't you hang them? -No. How could you believe in such a thing, how could you! -But.. I saw it with my own eyes! They were hanging! -Couldn't they just did it by themselves? -No! -Think. -Yes, they could. But... how could they? That's lying! -Mahmut Beg! Mahmut Beg! -Yes? -We're done, Mahmut Beg! We're dead!-What's the problem, sir? -You know the case that I've told you before.. -The thing about the school? -Yes. The other side won. They want us to leave this school as soon as possible! -So, what do you think of doing? -There's nothing to do! The Private Camlica High School is closing. -But how? These teachers, students.. what will happen to them? -What will happen to me? My job is closing! I'm done! -Let's move to an other building! -Are you kidding Mahmut Beg! Do you know how much are these rents? -They're so expensive! How can I find such a cheap place like this one? -But where can these students go in the middle of the winter? Which school would take them? -I don't care! They can go wherever they want! -But what you do is so wrong! It's so mean, sir! -No, it's just a trade. -You won millions because of these kids for years! What did you give back? And now you're throwing them to the streets! -I just do my job. They're not my son! -But they're all my kids! They're lazy, naughty and careless, but.. -Noone! Noone can touch them! I won't let them! -Did you get it sir? You'll let them have an education! -Sir calm down! -You have to! You have to! My kids!-My kids can't stay in streets! -Sir don't get angry! Calm down! -Don't be angry Mahmut Beg! Think about your heart! -Come on call the emergency!-Ok! -Be quick! -Mr. Avni! -Here comes our masterpiece! -Thanks sir! Thanks so much! -We owe you sir! -Have you asked to Teacher Mahmut the responsibility of hanging a man? -Teacher Avni should have make feel him regret that he's born. Sit down! Damn you all! You deceived me! You used me with your disgusting tricks! -I hurt the most perfect person because of you! -Was that your human love?-Was that your respect? -Mahmut Beg who you hate, said bad things almost died for you! -.. and maybe there is no Mahmut Beg anymore! And for me, you don't exist either! I disgust you! I hate you! -I'm ashamed of myself being your teacher, ashamed of myself believing in you, trusting you, loving you! -You scared me Mahmut Beg. -The doctor said that It's not critical anymore. You don't have to worry. -We're all so happy that you're healthy again. -All of my friends called me, thanks for not leaving me alone. -Sir.. I want to apologise. I thought you were different, but I was wrong. I can't forgive myself.. I'm so ashamed. -Don't say that. People get to know eachother and that's when they have real, strong friendships. -You're so great Mahmut Beg. -No. I just have more experience than you, that's all. -.. Now tell me. How's my students, kids doing? -They're all doing good. But they're really sad about you and the school's closing. -Goodbye -Saban is a cow -Hafize's Place -Don't let your head fall down. Don't mind. -They're emptying all over the place. -The special Camlica High School is done. -Kids, we were just starting to behave normal, they're closing the school. -If we had Mahmut Beg on our back, this wouldn't happen. -True. He wouldn't let us being school-less. -Guys, remember what he said at the camp? -What did he say? -A school doesn't have to be a place which has 4 walls and a roof. A school can be everywhere. The most important thing is to learn, to teach, to be together and.. -to fight for something. -Yes, true' He said that! -Man, you in? Let's make our own school! -Where? How? -It could be everywhere! It doesn't matter. Mountain, forest! The important thing is to be together! To have an education! To fight for it! -Are you in this war?-We're in! -Giant waves came up through the walls outside. These noises have your attention, but don't mind them.. -Riding a silver horse, roads end when you go, and go. A punishent ends when you lie, don't mind.. -When your troubles are so big, tell to God. There are days to see, don't mind.. -Welcome back, Mahmut Beg! -Welcome sir! -Are you Ok sir? How are you? -Thanks kids. Thanks! -So you forgive us, sir? -I was never offended! -We kicked out of school but we made a new school! -And you came, so everything's gonna be Ok!- -I'm so happy. I'm so proud of you guys! From now on, I'm with you too! We'll stand up for this war together. -Sorry. -Who do you look for? -I want to talk to this company's owner. -Mr. Seref? -Yes. -Do you have a reservation? -No. -I don't think he'll accept but.. -.. who called should I say? -Say that Mahmut is calling. -One minute sir. Mr. Seref, excuse me sir. A guy named Mahmut wants to talk to you. -No I don't know him. -Ok. -He says he's so busy. -Oh. -One minute! -Mr. Seref?-I'm busy sir! I told you that I have some work. -I understand sir. But there's an important thing that we should talk about. -Look at me! You don't have the right to get in without having a permission! -First, listen to what I'll say. -Are you a teacher? -Yes. -Your name is Mahmut, yes? -Yeah. -Did you teach in Sivas High school? -Sir! Did you recognise me?-No. -317 Seref. I was your student in the Sivas High! -317 Seref... Ah yes, I recognised you.. -Welcome sir! Don't stand like that, have a seat! Here... -Thank you. -God! I can't believe my eyes! Please forgive me for what I've said! I couldn't recognise you. -I couldn't before either. How many years have been passed? -Um.. at least 20 years sir! But you haven't changed! -... Excuse me! -Go on. -The same Mahmut Beg! -But I see that you changed a lot. -Yes. I'm doing great. I earned some money. I earned a lot. -I can tell that... -.. You were in really bad conditions, If I'm not wrong. Your family situation was so bad. -True! How can I forget those days. How can I forget you helping me? There was a poor Seref. He was hungry, he was poor.. -He was trying to have an education. He was trying to make his homework done under the street lamps, ...shaking from cold under the coat which Mahmut Beg gave him. -I didn't forget sir. I didn't forget the coat you gave me, and those hard days. Everything I have is now is because of those days.. -I know it. -I'm glad that you didn't forget all of that. Than do what I say.. -.. for the last time! -Just tell me sir! -Come with me! The Camlica High School -Who are these guys? -They're the students of the Camlica High; my students. -Your students? But what are they doing here? -Doing what you were doing before; trying to have an education! -But why in this place sir?-Why? Because someone who forgot his past, ...someone who came here with lots of difficulties, -.. someone who only sees money, took those poor kid's school away from them.. -... just to make some more money. And in the middle of the winter, seeing that they'll be in streets! -Someone who did this was an old student of mine. 317 Seref!-I didn't know! I swear I didn't know! -They didn't tell me anything! God, what did I do? Forgive me! Please forgive me sir! You can turn back to your school sir! -Maybe I can pay back that coat you gave me, and all of the other things! -The Camlica High School is yours and your students! -The End.
