I’m leaving. If we leave now, we can make it to fourth. I’m not going. Just because you’re smart doesn’t mean you get a pass. Kind of does. Why do you have your backpack then? Why do you have your backpack then? Just saying, but okay. Shit. She was shitty at getting it over, don’t you remember? Well, that’s why Sheri should be in the front, she’s the most intimidating. You call that intimidating? I mean, I almost knocked you out in practice a couple weeks ago, or do you not remember that? To be fair, she was on the ground for five minutes, so it makes sense that she doesn’t remember. At least I can laugh about it now. We should go watch him play. Who? Really? You’re still into that? I mean, he’s never been not a thing. Girl, you can do so much better. He’s so cute though. Really, you’re saying that to me now? I mean, he’s super cute. What’s the issue? Just saying, you’ve been hung up for a while. Do you guys smell that? It smells like swamp. You forget to brush your teeth this morning? She’s so deluded. Ready? Yes. I was a child and she was a child, in this kingdom by the sea. But we loved with a love that was more than love, I and my Annabel Lee. With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven coveted, her and me. What are you doing? What does it look like I’m doing? Why? Because I like it. Focus on your own stuff. Okay, okay. What else? Love? Yes, but what kind? Unconditional? There we go. Class started 15 minutes ago. I have a note. Fake. Shh. Quiet. Am I the only one that’s been thinking about this? Well, I remember it but, yeah. But they’re older and... And what does that mean? That means that they’re more interesting. They got more things to talk about. They got more things to do. Oh. Okay. They’re mature. I like them mature, so. Ah, drinks. I’m sold. Right! Yes! You were too easy to get there. What! Yeah, that was way too easy. I’m not easy. Yeah, that was way too easy. I’m not easy. I’m so not touching that. Listen, gotta start somewhere, right? Nah. You’re good. Thanks. How long have you been back? Six months. You know, I don’t live very far from you. Oh, yeah? I don’t live very far from you. Oh, right. Just off Bramwood. Nice. Thank you. Rose. Rose. Here we go. Where’s your paper? It’s up here. Summer. What do I know about Summer. Uhmm. Hmm. The Eiffel Tower grows six inches every year, due to the iron expanding in the heat. Uhmm. Uh, frisbees were invented in the 1800’s, it literally started as empty pie plates and they carried that on for about 60 years. Makes you wonder what other questionable things we’re doing right now. Uhmm. Ooh. It’s scientifically proven, that summer babies suffer from mood swings. Which may explain a few things. And that reminds me, none of you wished me a Happy Birthday, but I won’t hold that against you. That’s all I really have to say about summer. Okay. Anyone? Roy? That wasn’t really a poem, I mean, it was just facts laid out in different ways. Rose? Well, I don’t know how I’m supposed to debate off that. That wasn’t really a question, just words laid out in different ways. Who’s to say how a poem is defined anyway? Roy. Rose. Stay back. You have the highest test scores in your class. You may be able to get by with that in your other subjects, but not mine. If you don’t take it seriously, I’m going to have to fail you. You understand? Mhmm. You’re trying to get into Rhodes, aren’t you? Okay. What a bitch. She probably has a crush on you, I think she’s cute in a weird teacher way. Ew. That’s your pick? Hell no, Mr. Hall. Ew. Gross. Have you seen his chest, it like bulges out of his shirts. Miss Perez is sexy as hell. Oh yeah. I took ceramics because of her. Uh huh. She can work my pot any day. Yeah. Uh huh. She can work my pot any day. Yeah. Yes, please. No, I’m good. Yo, uhm, could you send me like ten bucks for the beers? No. Check this out. These are good. Have you seen his ID? Let me see. It looks nothing like him. How the hell do they let that pass? Couldn’t tell you. Tyler. What was that? Is no one gonna go get it? You're just gonna watch it. Can I show you how it’s done? Watch the master. There we go. 22? Yeah, 24 when you grow out your mustache. I’m gonna look so good with a mustache. Mmm, doubt it. Oh my god. I’m gonna get the little wax, do the little curly ones. The seal has broken. You guys let me walk around with lipstick on my teeth. Excuse me. It’s like so close, what is that? Alright, let me show you. Let’s bring this back. What? Well, that’s okay. I’ll just win all your games, guys. That doesn’t count either. What! Go Tyler! Don’t worry, I’ll bring it back. Blow. Blow. What do you think of her? Her? Mhmm. No. She’s cute. Right? So picky. Just too good for everyone. You skip grades in England or here? Uhm. When I took the placement tests here. Wow. That’s crazy. I guess. I always feel like I’ve learned everything I’m being taught though. Mm. I mean, that’s kind of a nice feeling, right? Knowing everything. Not really. I mean, why not? You don’t have to try as hard as we do. Yeah, but I don’t learn anything new. Tyler, your turn. Alright, let’s do this. Come on. Come on. Alright, let’s do this. Come on. Come on. You got this. So close. Trish? Yeah. Not really my type. What is your type? I don’t know. Playing hard to get? Nope. I’m gonna get another. Cool, yeah. Yeah! We won? We won! You suck. And you suck and you suck and you suck! He always told me that I had colors seeping out of me. But, I never listened. And the hues eventually faded. Why is it that we don’t know what we have until it’s gone? Is that all apart of the lesson of life? Or is fate another fable we’re told when we’re young so our lives aren’t meaningless? If there were a destiny, she would see all of my insecurities and she would purse her lips against the indented punctures that filled my head and she would make them okay. She wouldn’t take them away, or make them beautiful. She would accept them and all of the tiny fragments that piece me together. She would turn me into art. An impression of a majestic sunset where all of my inadequacies were the colors that melded the painting together. That’s all. Okay. Good job. I’m not the biggest fan. Eleven points is eleven points. Easy. Speak for yourself. Speak for yourself. I am. I am. Oh, look who decided to become Charlotte Bronte this week. I’m actually more of an Emily type. Like the Walmart version. You know, try not to think so hard. I can see some grays forming. At least she’s dry this time. I actually kind of liked it. Thanks. Cross in! You can’t go after him. Why? He likes Tyler. He doesn’t like her. Tyler? Hmm? Jeremy? All yours. If you can handle being second choice. Damn, it’s like that. I mean, I can live with that. Have you seen him? He’s super hot. I’m gonna rinse off, guys. I have to finish my homework, does anyone have any papers for me? I can come over. You are not copying me again. You are not copying me again. I mean like… It’s not copying, it’s brain trust. I mean like… It’s not copying, it’s brain trust. Oh, right. What are you doing out here? Waiting to get my phone back. Were you hoping I was waiting for you? What? No. You don’t wanna be here? What makes you say that? I don’t know. Feeling? It’s not really a matter of wanting. Why not? Is school a choice in your family? That’s not what I meant. Then what do you mean? Uhh, I just… Always… You’re red. Yeah, I just got out of practice. How was it? Good. Cool. Rose. Gotta get my phone. Bye. Miss you. I miss you. How’s school? Fine. Anything interesting? Nope. Nothing? It’s just school. How’s work? Fine. Long. They act like I have to show up to get paid. Rude. Grandma’s been asking about you. You know, school has the same policy, only there's no money involved. When do we hear? Should get the letter late Autumn. Exciting. Raven, which is never ending remembrance. Eyes meaning the essence of human identity of which you can’t separate from the human body. Watches and clocks often used symbolizing not what you think as uncertainty, but actually certainty of the inevitable. What do you know about that? What do you know about that? What do you know about that, girl? Okay long hair don’t care. Girl, what have you been doing tonight? Oh my god. Tyler. Hey. Hey. I didn't know you worked in here. I was here all the time anyway. Note? Yeah. Oh. He’s on his break right now. What? Then why did he call me in? I don’t know. Weird. Yeah. Okay. You know, I remember you. What? I remember you. Oh. From before. You were in Mrs. Bailey’s second grade class. I was in Stetson’s fourth. They used to bring our classes together for Art. You have a good memory. Yeah. I don’t remember much. You’re a senior now? Yeah. Cool. Do you feel nervous? About what? Graduating. Oh. No. Ecstatic more like. Really? Yeah, I can’t wait to get out of here. But, you just got here. So. There's a lot more to life out there. It’s just school. I mean we all have to go through it. At least we have free will? Do we? I mean, I’d like to think so. Then why do you hang out with people you don’t even like? I’ll see you around. See you. Bye. Hey. Phone taken away? No, I was waiting for you. Oh. Look I didn’t mean exactly what I said the other day. What did you mean exactly? They’re just. Not my kind of people. Just because they’re not your kind of people, doesn’t make them bad people. Okay, but you’re not that much like them. What am I like then? Smarter than you let on. Wow. No, it’s not a... I didn't mean anything by... I just meant that it… Sorry. I have to go. What can I do? I don’t know. Hey. Hi. Are your parents home? No. Are you thirsty? Oh. No, thanks. Uhm… Where are we doing it? Out here. What are you thinking about? What? Oh. Nothing really. What do you think about? Like in general? Or? What are you thinking about? No, nothing. Sometimes I don’t trust myself. Why? I don’t know. I just feel like I need a check in every now and then from someone. That what I’m looking at is actually what I’m seeing. And who usually does that? No one. So you’re just always confused? Maybe. How do you know what you want? I don’t always, but there are some things I’m certain about. And how do you know that? Just a feeling that I get. A feeling? Mhmm. What does it feel like? Like there’s no other choice. like someone’s squeezing my stomach. And other times you just don’t know? I guess. You always just know everything all the time? Pretty much. You can tell the moon is? Crescent. Crescent. Was the shading this way? Mhmm. You like Orwell? Yeah, does that surprise you? No, I don’t know. You have a brother, don’t you? How’d you know? Just a guess. You do remember. Some things. Certain smells. What does it smell like here? Kind of like summer. What does summer smell like? Uhmm. Like barbecues, the ocean. He’s in boarding school, my brother. Bad kid? No, he wanted to go. You didn’t? Seems a bit lonely. Why’d you move back? Uhm.. My grandma’s health was, well, is pretty bad. So, my mom wanted to, you know, come home. Did you want to? No. But, I mean, you know, we’re closer to going to University so, I’ll get to make my own decision eventually. What are you going to study? Writing. Maybe I’ll have your book one day. What about you? I don’t know. I’m afraid I’m going to choose the wrong thing because of job choice and be unhappy like my parents and be stuck with it. I mean, you can always change your mind. Yeah. I always thought about… No. What? I don’t know. What? Teaching. Yeah? You should do it. But the whole, presenting thing. Oh, that’s why you never read in class. I threw up. Sophomore year. Some nerve thing. I just hand my poems in now. I wouldn’t expect you to do that. You seem like someone who would, you know, perform well under pressure. You always know the right thing to say at school. You believe that? That people are only one certain way? Sometimes. Where’s your bathroom? First door on the left. I have to get home for dinner. Okay. Bye. You’re not going to walk me out? Why? Are you going to steal something on the way down? I mean, I was thinking about it, but now, I guess not. What are you smirking about? Just above average day. Yeah? What made it above average? I didn’t want to strangle anyone. Okay, fair enough. Bathroom? Hey. Hi. Note? No. You left your book at my place. Oh, yeah, I thought you’d like it. But you didn’t tell me to read it. Well, I thought you’d figure that out. Seems like you did. Yeah. I like it. Thought you would. Did I already say that? Yeah. My dad gave me that book when I was eight. That book? Did you understand it? Not at all. Are you going to English today? I haven’t decided yet. He’s been after Michele for at least a couple of years. Jay? You haven’t noticed when she’s around? He follows her around like a puppy. No, he’s not into all that traditional shit. She’s someone that fantasizes about going to the prom. You sound jealous. You do. You like Jay? What the hell, no. Where were you after school? We waited for you. Went to a Volleyball game. She went to go check out the girls. You into organized sports now? No, I just went because Miss Gerwin said she’d give me extra credit, okay? Calm down. Alright, whatever you say. I bet you she’s into some really weird shit. She just won’t admit it. Do you want me to check it? No, it’s okay. Which did you like? Uhm… I like the first one. Why? Why what? Why did you like the first one? I don’t know. There has to be a reason. Don’t you have one for everything? I guess I like the pattern. Stripes? Mhmm. Will you please come? I can’t. Mm… I heard you on the phone, you’re meeting up with Attwell. You were in the room, you know? I won’t know anyone. You’re a bit frustrating. You’re not exactly a wallflower. Besides, you can bring him. And you'll know me. I just… I’m not that comfortable. I understand. Hey. Hi. Do you need help? What is that? Tequila? Great. Full. Full send. I like it. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. She’s your moms age. That doesn’t make her less hot. But imagine if you could like somehow communicate with people without telling them what you’re actually feeling. You know what I mean? Like, it never comes out the way it is in your head anyway. But then you wouldn’t be able to hide anything and everything would be all exposed all the time. Yeah, but, you’d just cut through all the unnecessary bullshit quicker. But, come on, not everything you think you want to come true. Literally, it would be the worst. Maybe. It would be terrible. It’s really good. It’s great, right? Come on, dance. Dance with me. Come on, you know you want to dance. Come on. Hey Tyler. You’re pretty decent at flip cup. Where you going? I gotta go. What? We just got here. Yeah, well, my mom needs help with something. Come on, I’ll drop you off at home. You know, you're a surprisingly good drunk texter. Don’t look at me. Who said I was looking at you? I was talking to the guy over there. I can’t see. Well, that’s not good. I mean, I can see, but only out of this eye. Okay, can you stand? Well, I think I can manage. You okay? Shoot. I’m sorry. No, it’s fine. No one’s home. Tyler? Hmm? Why don’t you get with Sarah or Trish or someone? What? There are so many pretty girls at school. And out of it. And out of it. Do you not see yourself when you look in the mirror? Are you wearing my clothes? Shit. I have practice. Okay. Hey. Hi. This is my friend Tyler from school. Hi. Tyler Westley. Yeah. I knew your mom, my High School days. You went to school with her? I did. Is she still perfect? Pretty much. Yeah, well, we were all just trying to catch up with her. How is she? Yeah, fine. Tell her I said Hi. I will. Sorry I have to run. Tell her I said Hi! Okay, will do. Bye. Bye, nice to see you. Nice meeting you! She was just borrowing a book for class. I didn’t say anything. Why are you being weird? I’m not. How was work? Fine. What day is it again? Tyler! Hi. When did you get home? This morning. Where were you? Practice. How was it? It was work. Did you hear back from any schools? Not yet. Well, early admissions should be out by now. Yeah. I’ve been thinking about changing my major. To what? I don’t know. Education or something. That’s a joke, right? No, I’m good with numbers but, I don’t know if I see myself doing it for a career. But you think you could teach somebody? I don’t know. Tyler, you could barely present your show and tell in front of the class. Yeah. I have homework. Just go. Did you do this a lot back home? Well, I didn’t have a truck so… Funny. I don’t know what you’re doing with me. The way some people look at you. No, I don’t know about that. You know the dance is coming up? Yeah. And what are your thoughts on those kinds of things? Not really my kind of thing. Yeah, you’re probably too cool. Or not cool enough. I don’t know what view you have of yourself sometimes. I think you should come. Do you? Definitely. Okay. Really? Really? Yeah. Really. Really? Really, really, really. When do I get to meet your friends? You’ve met them. Same school. Properly. Okay. If you really want to meet mine first. I think we’re good. Is this gross? I was like what? She said you should do that. You should do that. They’ll just be like staring at things. Are you doing one of your little potions? Yeah, this is my potion. Tyler? She wouldn’t go there. I promise you. Kate said she saw them leaving the party together. Can I use some of that? Yeah. Maybe they’re just friends. Or maybe they’re fucking. I don’t know. You know how picky she is, you know, she has standards. True. I heard she was in rehab when she was like eleven. Probably, you know? Well, she’ll probably end up like her dad. That’s messed up. Well, it’s true. Wow. Done with that? You going to make out with it all day? Come on, guys. Lets get out of here. Hey. Hey. I haven’t heard from you. There’s a crazy amount of absences. I’ll see you after school? I already told Attwell I’d go to his house. Okay. You sure you’re okay? I can’t go to the dance with you. Why not? I just can’t. It’s tomorrow. Yeah. You should go with someone else. Why are you saying that? It’s not that serious, okay? Trish! Hey! Hey. Good practice. You too. What- Are you going to the dance? Uh, yeah. With friends. Would you maybe want to go together? Yeah. Definitely. Cool. Cool. I’ll see you tomorrow. Yeah, okay. Bye. It’s going to be quiet enough when you’re in college, huh? Humor me. I don’t have anything. I don’t believe that. Work that boring? And monotonous and tedious. You want me to keep going? If you want to. I passed English Lit. Oh, I didn’t know there was a chance that you wouldn’t. Just didn’t really care enough. You know, it’s nice to care sometimes. I guess I could tell myself that. One day you’ll look back at this time and wish it lasted forever. I don’t think so. Hi, darling. It’s me, your dad. I’m just calling to see how your first day back at school went, I bet it was brilliant. Anyway, I hope to see you soon. Well, whenever they let me out of here. So, yeah, take care now. Love you. Bye. I lapped you again. Well. She’s at the dance. Who? Really, you think we didn’t know? She went with Trish. I had a really good time tonight. Me too. I really hope it works out for you guys. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Bye. She is much like a flower. Delicate and beautiful. Yet strong and steady. And just like a flower, without any sun. She cannot flourish. I liked your poem. Thanks. Are you free tonight? Why? I want to show you something. What is this? Light it up. Would you want to dance with me?
