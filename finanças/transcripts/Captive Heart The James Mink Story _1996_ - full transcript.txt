BUT, JAMES, SHE HAS HER HEART SET ON THIS. ELIZABETH, SHE HAS A BLACK FATHER AND A WHITE MOTHER. NOT ONE YOUNG MAN HAS COME TO ASK FOR HER HAND. NOW, WE MUST FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN LOOK PAST HER LIABILITIES. OH, JAMES, HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HER THAT WAY? LOOK, I KNOW SHE LOOKS PERFECT TO US, BUT NOT EVERYONE SEES HER THAT WAY. AND WE MUST BE REALISTIC. WE MUST FIND SOME WAY TO OVERCOME IT. NOW, YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM? IT'S JUST THE NEWSPAPER NEVER RUNS ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS. YOU DO RUN MATRIMONIALS, DON'T YOU? OH, OF COURSE. IT'S JUST THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE OFFER SO BIG A DOWRY BEFORE. IT'S A DAMN FORTUNE. WELL, COULD YOU SEE THAT IT RUNS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?

NOW, MARY, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. THEN WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE? WHAT ABOUT MY PLANS? I WANT MORE FROM MY LIFE THAN-- I KNOW YOU DO. BUT IT'S YOUR FUTURE I MUST LOOK OUT FOR, BECAUSE A YOUNG WOMAN CANNOT FEND FOR HERSELF IN THIS WORLD TODAY. IT'S TOO HARD. THOSE DREAMS OF YOURS ARE MUCH TOO IMPRACTICAL. I WON'T ACCEPT THIS. DO YOU HEAR ME? I WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS. IT IS NOT YOUR DECISION. I'LL SPEAK TO HER. MARY WILL BE FINE. SHE JUST NEEDS TO GET USED TO IT, THAT'S ALL. SHE'S SO YOUNG, JAMES. OH, SO WAS THE YOUNG GIRL I SENT FOR 23 YEARS AGO. MARY'S NOT THAT GIRL. GROWING UP POOR IN IRELAND, CROSSING AN OCEAN BY MYSELF, IS A FAR CRY FROM THE SHELTERED LIFE SHE'S HAD. SHE'S NO MORE SHELTERED THAN HER SCHOOLMATES, MOST OF WHOM ARE PREPARING FOR THEIR WEDDINGS. SHE MAY NOT BE READY FOR MARRIAGE, JAMES. IS IT MARY WHO'S NOT READY, OR HER MOTHER? OH. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD WANT FOR MARY? I WOULD WANT FOR HER TO MARRY INTO A FAMILY THAT WOULD ACCEPT HER FOR THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL THAT SHE IS. AND THAT'S NOT ALL. I WOULD WANT HER TO KNOW THE HAPPINESS THAT WE'VE HAD. AND I WOULD WANT HER TO KNOW THIS. GOOD MORNING, MR. TODD. I HAVE SEEN OVER TWO DOZEN SUITORS, ELIZABETH. HALF OF THEM ARE NE'ER-DO-WELL FORTUNE HUNTERS, DOWN ON THEIR LUCK, AND THE OTHER HALF ARE SPOILED ARISTOCRATS, WITH NO MORE BUSINESS SENSE THAN ONE OF MY HORSES. PERHAPS GOD'S TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, JAMES. YES, WELL, GOD HAS THE LUXURY OF ETERNITY, AND WE DON'T, AND I REFUSE TO SETTLE FOR ANY RIFF-RAFF. I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE MARY TO ONE OF THOSE POOR SLAVES COMING INTO CANADA, CLAMORING FOR HIS FREEDOM. YOUR FATHER WAS ONE OF THOSE SLAVES, WASN'T HE, JAMES? NOW, YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEAN. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THE MAN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THERE IS ONLY JAMES MINK, AND HE'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR. HEH HEH HEH, SUCH BLARNEY. NOW, MINK, HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO OUR OFFER? MY BUSINESS FRIENDS ARE ANXIOUS FOR YOUR DECISION ON THIS CITY COUNCIL MATTER. NOW, WE FEEL YOU'RE THE KIND OF CANDIDATE TORONTO NEEDS RIGHT NOW. REALLY? WHY IS THAT, MR. CARBERRY? WELL, A MAN WHO STARTS OUT WITH A HORSE AND BUGGY AND BUILDS IT INTO ONE OF THE CITY'S MOST PROFITABLE BUSINESSES KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS TO WORK HARD. THIS HOTEL, LIVERY OPERATION-- YOUR FORTUNE HAS COME BY SWEAT, NOT BY BIRTHRIGHT. WELL, SURELY THERE ARE OTHER MEN THAT ARE MORE ACCOMPLISHED THAN MYSELF. NONE OF THEM POSSESS YOUR, UH, SHALL WE SAY, UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS? [ CHUCKLES ] LET'S BE HONEST, MR. CARBERRY. YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS FRIENDS, YOU OWN FACTORIES THAT ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF CHEAP LABOR. MEANWHILE, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PITIFUL FUGITIVE SLAVES POURING INTO CANADA. WHAT BETTER WAY TO ENTICE THEM INTO YOUR SWEAT SHOPS THAN BY USING ME, THE SON OF A FREED SLAVE, AS A SYMBOL OF WHAT HARD WORK CAN ACCOMPLISH? WHAT YOU WANT IS A TOKEN. OH, COME, NOW, MINK. CLEARLY, YOU'VE MISINTERPRETED OUR INTEREST. I WILL BE YOUR SYMBOL, MR. CARBERRY. BUT I WILL NEED SOMETHING IN RETURN. GO ON. YOUR COUNCIL HAS A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE IN WHO, UH, GETS THE ROYAL MAIL CONTRACT FROM KINGSTON TO TORONTO. AS YOU KNOW, I SUBMITTED A BID MYSELF. YOU ARE QUITE THE NEGOTIATOR, MINK. WELL, LET'S JUST SAY ITS, UH, ONE OF MY UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS, EH? [ LAUGHTER ] DO I HEAR 75? [ BANG ] 75, I HAVE 75. 75 ONCE, 75 TWICE. [ BANG ] SOLD TO MR. ROSS OF BROWN FARMS. HE'S A FINE HORSE.

OH, THEN YOU'VE FOUND YOURSELF AN ADEQUATE HORSE, BUT CLEARLY, YOUR STANDARDS ARE LOWER THAN MINE. OH, REALLY? WELL, THEN, UH, SUPPOSE YOU ENLIGHTEN ME. A MAGNIFICENT ANIMAL. LET'S JUST SAY SHE'S LIKE THE FIRST TASTE OF A VERY EXQUISITE CHAMPAGNE. MY NAME IS WILLIAM JOHNSON. I'M FROM NEW YORK, AND I REPRESENT A CARTEL IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WE'RE BRINGING THESE ARABIANS INTO THE PROVINCE. NOW, IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT, TWO YEARS FROM NOW, THERE WON'T BE A GENTLEMAN IN ALL OF UPPER CANADA WITHOUT ONE. IS SHE UP FOR AUCTION? THAT WOULD BE LIKE CASTING PEARLS BEFORE SWINE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY, SIR? I WON'T HAVE THESE BEAUTIES CROSS-BRED INTO OBLIVION. I'M GOING TO BE VERY SELECTIVE ABOUT WHO I SELL TO. IS SHE FAST? [ MUSIC ] HYAH! YAH! HORSES ARE MY LIVELIHOOD, AND I'VE NEVER RIDDEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE HER BEFORE. DO WE HAVE A SALE, THEN? WELL, I'M NOT SURE YOU'VE GIVEN ME YOUR BEST PRICE. PERHAPS WE SHOULD DISCUSS IT AT DINNER THIS EVENING. THAT IS, IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE ANY OTHER PLANS. I THINK I CAN REARRANGE MY SCHEDULE. GOOD. TELL ME, MR. JOHNSON, WHEN SHALL I EXPECT DELIVERY? WELL, THE DEMAND FOR THESE HORSES IS VERY HIGH, AND THE BOAT OUT OF AFRICA IS VERY SLOW. SO I CAN'T GUARANTEE THEM TILL LATE SUMMER. BUT THEY ARE WORTH WAITING FOR, AREN'T THEY, MR. MINK? I HAVE A FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO BE A VERY RICH MAN, MR. JOHNSON. YES. [ CHUCKLES ] BUT ALL THE SUCCESS IN THE WORLD WON'T MAKE UP FOR MY BEING SUCH A RUDE GUEST. MRS. MINK, MY APOLOGIES FOR TURNING YOUR LOVELY DINNER INTO A HORSE AUCTION. I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO BEHAVE IN THE COMPANY OF SUCH A CHARMING HOSTESS AND HER LOVELY DAUGHTER. MARY? PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE, MR. JOHNSON. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO A HORSEMAN FOR 23 YEARS. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE AN AMERICAN. YES, MA'AM, BUT GIVEN ALL THE UGLINESS DOWN SOUTH, PLEASE DON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST ME. FRANKLY, I SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN CANADA, I CONSIDER IT A SECOND HOME. IN FACT, I'M CONSIDERING MOVING HERE WHEN I FINALLY ESTABLISH MYSELF. AND WILL YOU BE BRINGING ANY FAMILY WITH YOU? I WISH I COULD SAY YES, BUT I'M AFRAID I'M CONDEMNED TO BACHELORHOOD. I SEEM TO BE MARRIED TO THE HORSE TRADE, AND IT'S A VERY JEALOUS BRIDE. WELL, PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT WOMAN YET. PERHAPS. MR. JOHNSON, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT A WOMAN GETTING A HIGHER EDUCATION? MARY. TELL ME, HOW SHOULD A YOUNG LADY FEEL WHEN HER FATHER TAKES AWAY HER DREAM OF COLLEGE TO ARRANGE HER MARRIAGE TO A COMPLETE STRANGER? MARY, THIS IS NEITHER THE TIME, NOR THE PLACE. I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, IF I MAY, MR. MINK. CERTAINLY, I'M NO EXPERT ON SUCH A PRIVATE MATTER. BUT MAYBE I CAN MAKE YOU BOTH HAPPY. MARY, IT IS YOUR FATHER'S DUTY TO FIND YOU A HUSBAND WHO WILL CARE FOR YOU THE WAY THAT HE HAS. BUT PERHAPS, IN HIS SEARCH, HE WILL FIND SOMEONE FORWARD-THINKING ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATED WIFE, AND MAN ENOUGH NOT TO GIVE A DAMN WHAT SOCIETY THINKS. WELL, I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT SUCH A MAN EXISTS, MR. JOHNSON, BUT, UH, I'M A REALIST. WELL, TIMES ARE CHANGING, MR. MINK. MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO CAST YOUR NET A LITTLE WIDER. IT WOULD BE A SHAME NOT TO LET SUCH A BRIGHT YOUNG LADY PURSUE HER DREAM. SIR? MARY, ELIZABETH. THANK YOU. MR. MINK? YES? AH. THERE WAS A MESSAGE AT MY HOTEL THAT SAID YOU WANTED TO SEE ME. YES. WILLIAM. COME, SIT DOWN. SHERRY? THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, THE, UH, OTHER EVENING, YOU ADVISED ME TO, UH, WIDEN MY SEARCH IN LOOKING FOR A HUSBAND FOR MARY. I HOPE I DIDN'T OVERSTEP MY BOUNDS. OH, NO, NO, NO. ON THE CONTRARY, IN FACT, YOU OPENED MY EYES. YOU ADVISED ME TO, UH, LOOK FOR A MORE FORWARD-THINKING MAN, SOMEONE WHO WOULD LET MARY PURSUE HER DREAMS. YES, I SAID THAT. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE... THAT YOU ARE THAT MAN. [ LAUGH ] I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. ALL I ASK--IF, OF COURSE, YOU WILL ACCEPT MY OFFER-- IS FOR YOU TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MARY, GIVE HER THE LOVE THAT SHE DESERVES. UH, YES, OF COURSE. I MEAN, UH-- MR. MINK, UH, MARY IS A LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN, BUT I-- I'LL NEED SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS. OF COURSE. I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS. [ STRING GROUP DANCE MUSIC ] MY COMPLIMENTS ON A LOVELY AFFAIR. YOUR DAUGHTER'S YOUNG MAN IS QUITE A CATCH. WE THINK SO, TOO, MR. CARBERRY. I'M ALSO IMPRESSED BY YOUR GUEST LIST. THIS KIND OF GALA EVENT CAN GO A LONG WAY IN AN ELECTION YEAR. SMART THINKING, MINK. MRS. MINK. OH, REALLY, AS IF OUR GUESTS WERE INVITED TO FURTHER YOUR AMBITIONS. THE MAN HAS NO MANNERS. WELL, HE'S A POLITICIAN. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. NOW, MAY I HAVE THE DANCE WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN ALL OF TORONTO? YES, YOU MAY. AH. [ APPLAUSE ] MOTHER, WERE YOU AFRAID? OH, YES, I THINK EVERY GIRL IS ON HER WEDDING NIGHT. BUT I SOON DISCOVERED THAT YOUR FATHER WAS A GENTLE AND TENDER MAN. AND I AM SURE THAT WILLIAM WILL BE THE SAME. OH, MARY, YOU'VE YOUR WHOLE LIFE BEFORE YOU. EMBRACE EVERY PART OF IT, WHETHER PLEASURE OR PAIN, WITH YOUR WHOLE SOUL. AND REMEMBER, GOD WILL NEVER PUT YOU THROUGH MORE THAN YOU CAN BEAR. I'VE FORGOTTEN. WHEN DO YOU SAIL? FIRST OF THE MONTH. MY DRIVER WILL TAKE US ACROSS THE BORDER INTO NIAGARA TONIGHT. WE SHOULD BE IN NEW YORK HARBOR BY THE WEEK'S END. MM-HMM. WELL, SIR, YOUR DOWRY. MR. MINK-- AH, JAMES, PLEASE. JAMES.

NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME. YOU'D BEST LEARN YOUR PLACE, AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT-- IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO LOWER THE VALUE OF SUCH A MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF PROPERTY, SIR. SHE CAUSED QUITE A STIR. YEAH, WELL, THIS LITTLE MULATTO'S EITHER DELIRIOUS FROM THE HEAT, OR HER HEAD'S FULL OF FANTASIES. EITHER WAY, A BEATING IS NO WAY TO TAME A SASSY MOUTH. YOU OUTBID THE OTHERS, AND YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE. MISTER. $1,200. I BELIEVE THE OFFER IS FAIR, GIVEN HER WILD STREAK. MISTER-- ON THE CONTRARY, PERHAPS HER WILD STREAK IS WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST. DO WE HAVE A SALE OR NOT? I BELIEVE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR MORE THAN A FIELD HAND, SIR. AND WHAT YOU WANT COMES AT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE. 2,000. MISTER, THIS MAN STOLE ME. HE KIDNAPPED ME. I'M NOT A SLAVE HERE. PLEASE BELIEVE ME. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE A VERY LOVELY YOUNG LADY. WE'RE GONNA MAKE A REAL GOOD HOME FOR YOU. MY FATHER WILL KILL YOU FOR THIS. BE GOOD TO YOUR NEW MASTER, NOW, MARY. YEEE! YEEHEE! YEEE! GOOD LUCK AT THE MARKET, MR. CLAY?

AND IF I CAN JUST GET WORD TO MY FATHER IN TORONTO, I KNOW HE'LL COME FOR ME AND TAKE ME BACK HOME. WILL YOU HELP ME? MARY, UH, I GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR YOU, GIRL. YOU IS HOME. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? I'M NOT A SLAVE. I WAS KIDNAPPED. I'M NOT LIKE YOU. GIRL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, WE ALL BEEN KIDNAPPED. YOU AIN'T NOTHING SPECIAL. DON'T MATTER HOW YOU GOT HERE. YOU'VE BEEN BOUGHT AND PAID FOR, JUST LIKE THE REST OF US, AND THAT MAKE YOU A SLAVE. IF YOU WON'T HELP ME, I'LL GO TO MR. CLAY. I'LL MAKE HIM BELIEVE THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS, MASSA CLAY AIN'T GONNA GIVE YOU UP FOR YOUR DADDY, OR NOBODY. NOW, HE DONE BROUGHT YOU HERE FOR ONE REASON. STOP THAT TALK, BOY.

WELL, AT LEAST I'M NOT SOME COWARD WHO'S TO AFRAID TO BE ANYTHING BUT A BOOT-LICKING SLAVE HIS WHOLE LIFE. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? DO YOU? THAT IS WHAT THEY GIVE A BOOT-LICKING SLAVE WHEN THEY CATCH HIM RUNNING. THEY BURN IT INTO HIM LIKE HE'S SOME DAMN ANIMAL. THEN THEY TELL HIM IF HE EVER RUN AGAIN, HE BEST GET FREE, BECAUSE IF THEY CATCH HIM, HE GONNA GET A ROPE AROUND HIS NECK. DON'T YOU JUDGE ME, GIRL, NOT TILL YOU BEEN WHERE I BEEN. DON'T YOU JUDGE ME, GIRL, NOT TILL YOU BEEN WHERE I BEEN. IT'S COLD OUT HERE. YOU SHOULD COME IN AND SIT BY THE FIRE. DO YOU THINK MARY'S SOMEWHERE LOOKING UP AT THESE SAME STARS RIGHT NOW? WELL, IF SHE'S ANYTHING LIKE HER MOTHER, SHE'S WONDERING THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU. I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE HEARD FROM HER BY NOW. THE MAIL FROM ENGLAND IS VERY SLOW. WE'LL HEAR SOMETHING REAL SOON. I MISS HER. THE FROST WILL BE HERE SOON. LOOK, ALL MY ROSES ARE LOSING THEIR PETALS. LOOK, ALL MY ROSES ARE LOSING THEIR PETALS. [ FOOTSTEPS ] MARY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? UM, YOUR BOOKS, SIR-- I WANTED TO SEE YOUR BOOKS. YOU CAN READ, THEN, MARY? SHOW ME. [ CLEARS THROAT ] "IN THEE I FONDLY HOPE TO CLASP A FRIEND WHOM DEATH ALONE COULD SEVER. TILL ENVY, WITH MALIGNANT GRASP DETACH THEE FROM MY BREAST FOREVER." "THE LYRIC POETRY OF BYRON." ARE YOU AWARE THE LAW ALLOWS ME TO HAVE YOU BEATEN FOR LEARNING TO READ? BUT THE LAW IS A FOOLISH ONE. WE'LL LET THIS BE OUR LITTLE SECRET. WE'LL LET THIS BE OUR LITTLE SECRET. "FATHER, WILLIAM JOHNSON SOLD ME AS A SLAVE. I'M BEING HELD AT THE CLAY PLANTATION NEAR RICHMOND. PLEASE HELP ME. THREE KISSES. MARY." [ HORSE WHINNIES ] MORNING MR. CLYDE. MORNING, MR. CLAY. YOU LOOK TROUBLED. SHH! GIVE IT UP.

I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT NO BOOK. BOY, YOU GET OUT OF HERE, AND DON'T YOU TELL NOBODY ABOUT THIS, YOU HEAR ME? GO ON. NOW, IT'S ONE THING I RISK MY HIDE ON YOUR FOOL LETTER, BUT YOU LEAVE THAT BOY BE. I AIN'T LETTING HIM CATCH HIS BACKSIDE ON STROOPE'S WHIP. WHAT, DID YOU TAKE THIS FROM THE BIG HOUSE? NO, MR. CLAY GAVE IT TO ME. THERE'S NOTHING AGAIN TODAY. WELL, PERHAPS TOMORROW. THAT ONE'S VERY ODD. IT'S FROM AMERICA. OH, MY GOD. IT'S MARY. WHAT IS? WHAT'S HAPPENED? OH, MY GOD! OH, NO, THIS CAN'T BE TRUE. JAMES, TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE. SON OF A-- NO, NO, IT'S A MISTAKE. IT MUST BE A MISTAKE. THAT IS MARY'S WRITING. IT'S HER! OH, JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I'LL HAVE TO GO AND GET HER. I'LL BRING HER HOME SAFELY, AND WHEN I COME BACK, I'M GONNA HUNT THAT BASTARD DOWN, AND I'M GONNA KILL HIM! NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT. NO, WE HAVE TO TALK. I GOT HER INTO THIS, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET HER OUT. NO, WE'RE BOTH TO BLAME. NOW, LISTEN, WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE TO HELP US. NO, SOMEONE WILL HELP US! PLEASE! [ SOBBING ] OH, MY GOD. MY GOD. WE HAVE BEEN TO THE QUEEN'S MILITIA, LORD ELGIN, AND TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY, AND NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE TO DO A THING ABOUT IT. NOW, THEN, I'M DESPERATE. WE NEED YOUR HELP. WELL, OF COURSE, I'LL FILE LETTERS OF PROTEST WITH PRESIDENT FILLMORE AND THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. BUT APART FROM THAT, THERE'S LITTLE I CAN DO. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO GET THE AMERICANS TO COOPERATE? MR. MINK, PLEASE TRY TO UNDERSTAND. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE STATES IS STRAINED AT BEST. NOW, GIVING REFUGE TO THEIR FUGITIVE SLAVES HASN'T HELPED MATTERS. WE'RE IN NO POSITION TO MAKE STRONG DEMANDS AGAINST WASHINGTON. I'M SORRY. LORD ELGIN, MY DAUGHTER IS BEING HELD AGAINST HER WILL IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE GOVERNOR GENERAL OF UPPER CANADA IS JUST GOING TO ABANDON HER? JAMES, WE'VE TAKEN ENOUGH OF LORD ELGIN'S TIME. JAMES, WE'VE TAKEN ENOUGH OF LORD ELGIN'S TIME. EXCUSE ME, SIR. SIR? YES. I KNOW IT AIN'T MY PLACE TO GIVE ADVICE, BUT YOU KNOW I LOVE MISS MARY, TOO. YOU SEE, SIR, I KNOW THIS LADY, BIDDY SHADD, SHE RUNS THE SLAVE CAMP OUT AT MACAULEY TOWN. SHE BEEN LIKE AN ANGEL TO ME AFTER I GOT FREE. WELL, SHE KNOWS FOLKS THAT HELP THE RUNAWAYS DOWN SOUTH. MAYBE SHE CAN HELP MISS MARY. MR. MINK, WELCOME. MISS SHADD? THE FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO IS GET WORD TO MY ABOLITIONIST FRIENDS IN THE STATES. NOW, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT ARRANGING AN ESCAPE CAN TAKE MONTHS, SOMETIMES YEARS. YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO NAME THEIR PRICE. I'M WILLING TO PAY ANYTHING TO GET MARY OUT. I KNOW YOU'RE A RICH MAN, MR. MINK, BUT YOU COULD SPEND YOUR ENTIRE FORTUNE AND STILL NOT GUARANTEE HER FREEDOM. THE SLAVE OWNERS ARE READY TO KILL ANYONE CAUGHT HELPING THE FUGITIVES. THEY EVEN THREATEN THEIR OWN SLAVES WITH DEATH IF THEY TRY TO ESCAPE. THE TRUTH IS, THE MAN HOLDING YOUR DAUGHTER WOULD PROBABLY RATHER SEE HER HANG THAN SET FREE. I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH, MISS SHADD. IF YOUR FRIEND'S NOT WILLING TO GET MARY OUT QUICKLY, I WILL GO TO VIRGINIA AND BRING HER HOME MYSELF. I'LL BURN IN HELL BEFORE SHE SUFFERS A MOMENT LONGER. WE'LL HELP YOU, MR. MINK. I FOUND THIS MAN IN BUFFALO. JAMES, I CAN'T STAY HERE ALONE. I'VE ALREADY FAILED MARY, AND I WON'T MAKE MATTERS WORSE BY PUTTING YOU IN DANGER, AS WELL. AND I WON'T RISK LOSING EITHER ONE OF YOU. I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO DO WHAT YOU'VE ASKED OF ME. THIS TIME, I CAN'T. SHE'S MY DAUGHTER, TOO. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THE SOUTH IS NO PLACE FOR A BLACK MAN AND HIS WHITE WIFE. JAMES, THIS LIFE WE HAVE HERE, THIS HOME, WITHOUT YOU, WITHOUT MARY, WHAT COULD IT MEAN TO ME? NOW, I AM GOING WITH YOU. SOMETHING'S WRONG, JAMES. SHE CAN'T HAVE MEANT US TO COME HERE. NO, THIS HAS TO BE IT. [ GUN COCKS ] WELL, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE GOT OUT-OF-TOWNERS HERE, BOYS. DIDN'T YOU FOLKS KNOW IT ISN'T HEALTHY FOR A COLORED MAN TO BE OUT AFTER DARK? PLEASE, I'M NOT ARMED. I'LL DO AS YOU ASK. JUST LEAVE MY WIFE ALONE. SHE'S YOUR WIFE? YES. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? JAMES MINK. SORRY IF WE SCARED YOU. THERE'S A RUNAWAY FAMILY INSIDE, AND WE'RE TAKING THEM OVER THE BORDER TOMORROW. THE STREET'S BEEN CRAWLING WITH SLAVE-CATCHERS. BIDDY'S WIRE SAID YOU HAVE TO GET TO NEWCASTLE. THE BEST BET WILL BE TO GO THROUGH HAGERSTOWN, MARYLAND, THAT'LL BE THE FURTHEST POINT SOUTH IN FREE TERRITORY. THEN CATCH THE DAY TRAIN TO VIRGINIA. WE'LL NEED LODGING. YOU'LL STAY HERE TONIGHT. BUT FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL TRAVEL ONLY BY DAY. THERE ARE SAFE HOUSES HERE, HERE, AND HERE. MAKE SURE YOU REACH THEM BY SUNDOWN. WHEN YOU GET TO NEWCASTLE, FIND THE QUAKER CHURCH FIRST THING, AND THE MINISTER THERE WILL HELP YOU THE REST OF THE WAY. WHY THE QUAKERS? DOWN SOUTH, MR. MINK, BELIEF IN JESUS IS NOT SURE SIGN OF GOODNESS, EXCEPT AMONG THE FOOT-WASHERS. I WOULD LIKE TO BOOK PASSAGE FOR TWO TO NEWCASTLE. $6 WILL BUY YOUR MASTER TWO SEATS, BOY. BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO SOUTH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO POST A BOND ON YOUR HEAD BEFORE GETTING ON THAT TRAIN. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND, SIR. I'M A FREE MAN. I HAVE TO SEE YOUR PAPERS, THEN. I BEG YOUR PARDON? IF YOU'RE FREE, JUST SHOW ME YOUR DAMN PAPERS, OR MOVE ALONG. I SAID BEFORE, I WAS A FREE MAN. MY WORD SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT. WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO, NIGGER? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE? THE BOY HERE SAYS HE'S FREE, BUT HE AIN'T GOT NO PAPERS. HE DON'T LOOK LIKE NO RUNAWAY. WHY DON'T WE GO LOOK AT THE NOTICES, JUST THE SAME? LET GO OF ME! NIGGER, YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T SHOOT YOU. YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE EVER SINCE YOUR MASTER DIED. NOW, YOU'LL APOLOGIZE TO THESE GENTLEMEN. YOU BETTER LEARN SOME MANNERS, BOY, OR THAT SASSY TONGUE OF YOURS IS GONNA GET YOU STRUNG UP. I'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY OWN SLAVE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NOW, YOU HEARD ME. APOLOGIZE. I'M SORRY, SIR. I'M SORRY, SIR. ALL ABOARD TO NEWCASTLE. SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS NOW, HUH? JAMES MINK, SLAVE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ANYONE ELSE SEES RIGHT NOW. ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT WE KNOW WHO WE REALLY ARE. I'M SORRY I HAD TO HIT YOU. NO, NO ONE MUST SEE YOU TOUCHING ME, EVER. TIME TO BOARD NOW, MA'AM. YOUR NIGRA CAN PUT YOUR BAGS IN THE SLAVE CAR. MA'AM. [ TRAIN CHUGS, BELL RINGS ] [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] A PROPER GENTLEMAN NEVER EATS WITH HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE. [ SLURP ] [ LAUGH ] YOU'RE COMING WITH ME, YOU LITTLE HALF-BREED. GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. DON'T LIE TO ME. I CAUGHT THAT LITTLE DARKIE EPHRAIM CUTTING HIS NAME INTO A TREE. ONLY SOMEBODY WITH A FANCY TONGUE COULD HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT. I KNOW YOU BEEN TEACHING HIM. IT WASN'T HER, BOSS. I LEARNED THE BOY MYSELF. YOU'RE LYING, BOY. AIN'T NO NIGGER DUMB AS YOU COULD LEARN READING AND WRITING. I STOLE IT FROM THE MASTER'S STUDY. I'VE BEEN LEARNING MYSELF HOW TO READ. NO, ELROI. SHUSH UP, GIRL. OH, YOU'RE LYING, ELROI. "SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY LIKE THE NIGHT OF CLOUDLESS CLIMES AND STARRY SKIES." YOU MUST LIKE GETTING WHIPPED, BOY. FOR BREAKING THE NIGGER CODE OF READING AND WRITING, THE LAW SAYS YOU GET 39 STRIPES. LASH HIS HANDS. HAVE IT YOUR OWN WAY, BOY. ONE. TWO. [ WHIMPERS ] PLEASE, LET ME STOP THIS. THREE. LET IT GO, CHILD. THE BOSS GONNA HAVE ELROI'S HIDE, NO MATTER WHAT. FOUR. [ WHIP POPS ] FIVE. [ WHIP POPS ] SIX. [ WHIP POPS ] SEVEN. [ WHIP POPS ] SEVEN. ELROI, I'M SO SORRY. [ HARMONICA ] [ CHURCH BELL TOLLS ] PARDON ME, SIR. WE WERE TOLD YOU DEAL IN BLACK WOOL. AND WHO TOLD YOU THAT? A FRIEND OF A FRIEND. I'VE MANY FRIENDS. YOU'LL HAVE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC. ARE THESE RIDDLES NECESSARY? IT WAS A MAN IN BUFFALO, HIS NAME WAS RISSER. THEN YOU ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. I'M SORRY FOR THE INTRIGUE, BUT THE SLAVE TRADE HAS MANY EYES AND EARS. I'M REVEREND ELI BRENNEMAN. ELIZABETH MINK. SO, REVEREND, HOW FAR IS THIS CLAY PLANTATION? A GOOD HOUR'S RIDE FROM HERE. GOOD. WE CAN GET THERE BY NIGHTFALL. MR. MINK, I CAUTION YOU ABOUT BEING TOO HASTY. GETTING A SLAVE OFF A PLANTATION IS VERY DANGEROUS. BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING, WE'RE GONNA NEED A PLAN. MARY IS NOT A SLAVE, SIR. AND I ALREADY HAVE A PLAN. WE'LL SLIP IN THERE BY NIGHTFALL, AND WE'LL GET MARY OUT. YOU MIGHT MANAGE THAT. YOU MIGHT EVEN GET HER ALL THE WAY BACK TO TOWN. BUT HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET OUT OF VIRGINIA WITH EVERY MARSHAL AND SLAVE-CATCHER FROM HERE TO THE BORDER LOOKING FOR A FAIR-SKINNED RUNAWAY, A COLORED MAN AND A WHITE WOMAN? MR. MINK, IF YOU'RE CAUGHT, YOU COULD BE SOLD AS A SLAVE, AND ELIZABETH COULD BE JAILED. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO MARY IF THEY HAVE TO SEND HER BACK TO THE CLAY PLANTATION. TELL US WHAT WE MUST DO. MARY, I'M SORRY FOR WHAT STROOPE DID TO ELROI. HAD I KNOWN ABOUT IT, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT. YES, SIR. HE'S A GOOD MAN, MR. STROOPE. HE JUST GETS CARRIED AWAY SOMETIMES. MY GOD, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL. OH! SHH. IT'S JUST A SCRATCH. NO, DON'T. PLEASE, PLEASE. MARY. PLEASE, STOP IT. MARY. DON'T YOU EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN. I THINK YOU'RE FORGETTING WHO I AM. I PAID A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY FOR YOU. I'LL DO WITH YOU AS I PLEASE! [ HARMONICA MUSIC ] YOU SEE THAT BUNCH OF STARS THERE? THE SLAVE FOLK CALL THAT "THE DRINKING GOURD." THE HANDLE POINTS NORTH, TOWARD THE PROMISED LAND. TO MY HOME. YES. ELROI, WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE THAT TIME, OUT THERE ON THE RUN? THEM THREE DAYS WERE SWEET AS HONEY, EVEN WITH THEM DOGS ON MY HEELS. I WAS MY OWN MASSA, MY OWN MAN. ONCE YOU GET A TASTE OF FREEDOM, YOU DON'T NEVER LOSE YOUR HUNGER FOR IT. DID YOU EVER IMAGINE TRYING TO RUN AGAIN? HMM. I USED TO THINK ABOUT IT EVERY NIGHT. JUST NOW, I GOT MORE REASON TO STAY. ELROI... I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU, BUT I CAN'T LIVE THIS WAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, I JUST CAN'T. I KNOWS YOU CAN'T, MARY. I KNOW. LOOKY HERE, A WHOLE MESS OF POTATOES, ALL PEELED AND READY TO COOK. I WONDER WHO DONE THAT? [ CHUCKLES ] SOMEONE WHO HAD A GOOD TEACHER. TAKE THESE SWEETS ON INTO THE PARLOR. MRS. CLAY'S WAITING ON THEM. THE CLAYS HAVE OWNED THIS PROPERTY FOR 150 YEARS, MRS. CARBERRY. INDEED. FOOL GIRL, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE, THEY'RE RUINED! GET DOWN AND CLEAN UP THAT MESS. OH, NO, PLEASE. IT'S MY FAULT. I'M AFRAID I GAVE YOUR LITTLE NIGRA GIRL QUITE A START. HERE, DEAR, LET ME HELP YOU. REALLY, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY, MRS. CARBERRY. OH, SHE'S SUCH A NERVOUS LITTLE THING. I DON'T MIND HELPING. THERE, NOW I'M SURE SHE'LL BE JUST FINE. MR. CLAY, I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRESUMPTUOUS, BUT MY SLAVE JAMES IS RATHER PARCHED AFTER OUR LONG RIDE. I WONDER IF YOU COULD SEND THE GIRL OUT TO THE STABLES WITH A COOL DRINK FOR HIM. SEE TO IT, MARY. THANK YOU. [ MUSIC SWELLS ] ONCE. TWICE. I'D LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT TRYING TO REMEMBER YOU AND MAMA, YOUR VOICES, YOUR CLOTHES, ANYTHING TO HANG ONTO UNTIL YOU CAME FOR ME. BUT AFTER A WHILE, IT GOT HARDER AND HARDER TO PICTURE YOU. AND I REALIZED THAT MY WORST FEAR WAS THAT I MIGHT FORGET YOU, AND THAT YOU MIGHT FORGET ME. MARY. [ DOOR OPENS ] IT'S ALL RIGHT, DADDY. HE'S A FRIEND. MY NAME IS ELROI, SIR. I'M GONNA HELP YOU GET YOUR DAUGHTER OFF THIS PLACE. TELL ME, MRS. CARBERRY, WHAT LED YOU TO BELIEVE I MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN SELLING OFF A PIECE OF MY LAND? AN EDUCATED GUESS, MR. CLAY. ACCORDING TO YOUR NEIGHBORS, THAT PARCEL HAS LAIN FALLOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AND WITH TOBACCO PRICES DOWN THE WAY THEY ARE, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE OPEN TO A FAIR OFFER. NOW, OF COURSE, IF I'M MISTAKEN, THERE MIGHT BE OTHER PLANTERS I COULD TALK TO. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. YOUR OFFER IS GENEROUS. I'M SURE WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT. BUT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT ONE THING. 30 ACRES IS NO SMALL UNDERTAKING. HOW WILL YOU MANAGE ON YOUR OWN? WE IRISH HAVE NEVER BEEN AFRAID OF HARD WORK, MR. CLAY. BESIDES, I LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT BUSINESS FROM MY LATE HUSBAND. A GOOD BUSINESS MIND WILL ONLY TAKE YOU SO FAR. YOU'LL NEED STRONG BACKS TO WORK THIS LAND. I'M SORRY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WELL, SLAVES, DEAR. SURELY YOU'LL WANT TO BUY YOURSELF SOME GOOD NIGRAS. AYE, OF COURSE, I'M SORRY. I'VE HAD A VERY LONG DAY. IN FACT, I'VE TAKEN UP FAR TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME. I WONDER IF YOU'D BE KIND ENOUGH TO ASK MY DRIVER TO COME ROUND. OH, NONSENSE, MRS. CARBERRY, YOU'LL BE OUR GUEST TONIGHT. THEN WE CAN CONCLUDE OUR BUSINESS IN THE MORNING. WELL, I'M VERY GRATEFUL. WHERE SHALL I HAVE MY SLAVE SLEEP? I WOULDN'T FRET, DEAR. I'M SURE HE'S ALREADY FOUND HIMSELF A NICE SPOT FOR THE NIGHT. IF THERE'S ONE THING NIGRAS LOVE TO DO, IT'S SLEEP. NOW, IT TAKE A MAN TEN MINUTES TO MAKE IT TO THE CREEK, FOLLOW IT DOWNSTREAM TO WHERE IT GETS SHALLOW, AND THEN FROM THERE, IT'S JUST A STRETCH OF FIELD TO NEWCASTLE. THAT WOULD TAKE AN ETERNITY. I SAY WE USE THE SHADE OF THE TREES, AND FOLLOW THE ROAD ALL THE WAY TO TOWN. THAT WOULD BE HALF THE TIME. NOW, THAT'S FOOL-HEADED. THEM SLAVE-CATCHERS' HOUNDS WILL BE ON YOUR TAIL BEFORE YOU'RE A MILE OFF THE PLANTATION. THAT CREEK'S THE ONLY WAY TO THROW THEM DOGS. YOU TAKE YOUR WAY, YOU'RE GONNA GET MARY KILLED. LOOK, THIS IS MY PLAN. YOU NEED TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND STAY OUT OF MINE. HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT TO HIM? MARY. [ SIGH ] MRS. CARBERRY. YES? MRS. CARBERRY, IF I MAY ASK A PERSONAL QUESTION. YOUR HUSBAND, WAS HIS ILLNESS A LENGTHY ONE? NO, HE DIED RATHER SUDDENLY, ACTUALLY. OH, I'M SORRY. BUT PERHAPS IT WAS GOD'S WAY TO SPARE YOU THE PAIN OF LOSING HIM GRADUALLY. YES, PERHAPS. YOU'RE VERY BRAVE TO BE STARTING A NEW LIFE FOR YOURSELF. WELL, THANK YOU. WELL, GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. [ WOMAN SINGING SPIRITUAL ] MARY? I KNOW YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO HATE ME. I ONLY WANTED THE BEST FOR YOU. [ SOBBING ] I'M SORRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY, MR. CLAY. I'LL WIRE MY BANK AS SOON AS I GET BACK TO THE HOTEL. I SHOULD HAVE MONEY FOR YOU BY WEEK'S END. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR NEXT VISIT. THANK YOU, SIR. JAMES? [ CHURCH BELL TOLLS ] I HAVE THE DRAFT. THAT'S A LOT TO PAY FOR LAND WE WILL NEVER USE. OH, JAMES, LOOK. IT'S KITCHEL, JOHNSON'S MAN. STAY HERE. NO. I SAID, STAY HERE. STOP, PLEASE. [ DOOR CLOSES ] JOHNSON, THAT YOU? JOHNSON? JOHNSON? KITCHEL. [ BANG ] WHERE'S WILLIAM JOHNSON? I AIN'T TELLING YOU NOTHING. WHERE IS HE? JAMES! GET OUT OF HERE, ELIZABETH. REMEMBER WHY WE'VE COME. GET ME SOME ROPE. REVEREND BRENNEMAN? WE MUST GO NOW. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WILLIAM JOHNSON, THAT BASTARD WHO STOLE MARY, HE'S IN TOWN. I HAD A RUN-IN WITH HIS MAN. I MADE SURE HE CAN'T FOLLOW US, BUT IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE JOHNSON FINDS US. BUT WE NEED MORE TIME. WE DON'T HAVE TIME. WE MUST GO NOW. WE MAY NOT HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE. THEN WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE DO. AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY PROTECT US. AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY PROTECT US. I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR SIGN. MRS. CARBERRY. MR. CLAY, I'M SORRY TO INTRUDE. SOMETHING URGENT HAS COME UP, AND I HAD TO SEE YOU AT ONCE. PLEASE, COME IN. HYAH. MARY. DADDY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SOMETHING HAPPENED. JOHNSON IS ON HIS WAY. JOHNSON? WE HAVE GOT TO GO. BUT DADDY, I HAVEN'T EVEN SAID GOODBYE TO INDIGO, TO ELROI. I WISH WE HAD TIME. BUT WE'VE GOT-- YOU GOING, AIN'T YOU? THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU. ELROI, IF THEY CATCH YOU, THEY'LL HANG YOU. I GOT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE. YOU CAN'T STAY HERE, AND I CAN'T STAY HERE WITHOUT YOU. ELROI, IT'LL BE MUCH TOO DANGEROUS. I DIDN'T MAKE PLANS FOR YOU. I CAN HELP YOU, SIR. I KNOW HOW THEM SLAVE-CATCHERS DO THINGS. IT'S TOO RISKY. DADDY, I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT HIM. I'M SORRY FOR YOUR TROUBLES, MRS. CARBERRY. I HOPE THE QUESTIONS CONCERNING YOUR HUSBAND'S ESTATE CAN BE CLEARED UP QUICKLY. YES, I HOPE SO, TOO. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S A MATTER I MUST SEE TO IN PERSON. THANK YOU. BUT I WANTED TO BE SURE THAT OUR BUSINESS WAS CONCLUDED BEFORE I LEFT FOR THE CAROLINAS. I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT IN ORDER, SIR. I'M VERY GRATEFUL. BUT SURELY THIS COULD HAVE WAITED FOR YOUR RETURN. BELIEVE ME, MR. CLAY, NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN FINISHING THIS UP. ELROI. BROUGHT YOU SOME MORE FIREWOOD, MAMA. IT'S GONNA LAST ME A LONG TIME, SON. MAMA, I GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU. LOOK HERE, ELROI, I MADE YOUR FAVORITE, SWEET JAMS. LOOK HERE, ELROI, I MADE YOUR FAVORITE, SWEET JAMS. I LOVE YOU, BOY. I LOVE YOU, TOO, MAMA. GO, GO. WHAT THE-- [ DOOR OPENS ] WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE, BOY? NOTHING, SIR. YOU'D BEST NOT BE LYING TO ME. WHAT WE GOING TO DO NOW? WHEN HE COME TO, HE GONNA KNOW YOU'RE A PART OF THIS. THEN WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO CONVINCE HIM OTHERWISE. OH. COME ON. WHOA, GIRL. [ HORSE WHINNIES ] DAMN. THIS WAY! HURRY, HURRY! IN THE WAGON. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE IN ORDER. WELL, IF YOU'LL JUST COUNTERSIGN, THEN WE'LL BE NEIGHBORS, MR. CLAY. INDEED. [ ALARM BELL RINGS ] GET THE HORSES. WHAT IS IT, STROOPE? ESCAPE, SIR. IT'S ELROI AND THAT MULATTO GIRL. THEY KNOCKED ME AND THE MA'AM'S NIGGER COLD. OH, NO. AND ALL THE HORSES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR. I'M GUESSING THEY'RE ON FOOT. MRS. CARBERRY, PLEASE FORGIVE THIS INTERRUPTION. OBVIOUSLY, I'M GOING TO BE INDISPOSED FOR THE NEXT WHO-KNOWS-HOW-LONG. PERHAPS WE CAN CONTINUE THIS BUSINESS LATER. YES, OF COURSE. GOOD DAY, THEN. STROOPE, GATHER THE DOGS. [ DOGS BARK ] NO, MR. STROOPE, PLEASE DON'T HURT ELROI. GET OF MY WAY, INDIGO. DON'T HURT MY BOY. [ DOGS GROWL ] PLEASE, MASTER, HE A GOOD BOY. PLEASE, YOU LOVE OLD INDIGO. DO IT FOR ME. I CAN'T DO THAT, INDIGO. LET HIM GO! MR. STROOPE. PLEASE, PLEASE! MASTER, DO IT FOR ME! PLEASE, LET HIM GO. THEY CAN'T BE STUPID ENOUGH TO HIDE IN THE HOUSE. [ SHOUTS ] WHAT THE HELL? DO SOMETHING. PERFUME. WE'RE GONNA SEARCH EVERY ROAD AND FARM FROM HERE TO NEWCASTLE UNTIL WE FIND THEM. YES, SIR. [ DOGS BARK AND GROWL ] [ HORSES WHINNY ] MAMA! OH, MAMA! [ SOBBING ] KITCHEL? KITCHEL, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU? [ MUFFLED YELLING ] WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? IT'S MINK. HE CAME AFTER HIS DAUGHTER. WE LEAVE AT FIRST LIGHT. IT'S A TWO-DAY TRIP BY ROAD TO POINT PLEASANT ON THE OHIO RIVER. ONCE YOU'RE THERE, YOU'LL BE MET AND TAKEN ACROSS TO THE OHIO SIDE AND SAFETY. BUT THERE'S STILL 200 MILES FROM PORT PLEASANT TO CANADA. 200 OF THE SWEETEST MILES THIS SIDE OF HEAVEN, SIR. SLAVE FOLK CALL IT THE "FRONT PORCH OF THE PROMISED LAND." THE SLAVE-CATCHERS OF OHIO ARE OUTNUMBERED 50 TO 1 BY OUR PEOPLE. ONCE THAT BOAT GETS YOU ACROSS THE RIVER, YOU'RE AS GOOD AS HOME. AND I DIDN'T FORGET YOUR PROMISE, MAMA. WHAT PROMISE, DEAR? THAT GOD WOULD NEVER PUT ME THROUGH MORE THAN I COULD BEAR. MARY, TELL ME ABOUT ELROI. I KNOW HE'S NOT WHAT FATHER WANTS FOR ME, BUT HE'S KIND AND GENTLE, AND MORE OF A MAN THAN ANY OF THOSE PRETENDERS IN TORONTO. AND DO YOU LOVE HIM? HE RISKED HIS LIFE FOR ME, MOTHER. BUT DO YOU LOVE HIM? WITH ALL MY HEART. WELL, THEN, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, DOES IT? ONE THING BOTHER ME, PREACHER, IS IT SEEMS KIND OF FOOL-HEADED TRAVELING BY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY CAN SEE US. ELROI, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. ELROI, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. NEWS TRAVELS FAST, MR. JOHNSON. IN MY BUSINESS, IT PAYS TO HAVE AN EAR TO THE GROUND, MR. CLAY. I CAME TO OFFER YOU MY HELP. I THINK MY MEN ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TRACKING DOWN OUR OWN NIGRAS. WELL, I DON'T MEAN TO STICK MY NOSE IN, BUT IT SEEMS YOUR MEN ARE OUTSIDE WATERING THEIR HORSES WHILE YOUR SLAVES ARE MAKING TRACKS NORTH. HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO BRING THEM BACK? I'M A FAIR MAN. 1,000 FOR THE BOY, 2,000 FOR THE GIRL. THAT'S ABSURD. I COULD HAVE ANY SLAVE GIRL I WANT FOR HALF THAT PRICE. AH, BUT ANY SLAVE GIRL WOULDN'T BE MARRIED, NOW, WOULD SHE? HALF NOW, HALF WHEN YOU BRING THEM BACK. I'LL NEED TO TALK TO THE BOY'S MAMA. MR. JOHNSON, WHAT'S YOUR INTEREST IN MARY? SURELY IT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY. YOUR MRS. CARBERRY AND THE COLORED SHE TRAVELS WITH ARE SLAVE RUNNERS. WE'VE CROSSED PATHS BEFORE. I DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE THE LAST WORD WHERE THE MULATTO'S CONCERNED. GOOD DAY, MR. CLAY. MA'AM. SHERMAN, IF YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF LOVING ME, AT LEAST LET ME KEEP MY DIGNITY. LET THE GIRL GO. YOU'RE PATHETIC. JUST TELL ME WHO HELPED THEM ESCAPE, MAMA, AND WE'LL LEAVE YOU IN PEACE. CAN'T NOBODY GIVE ME PEACE BUT MY LORD. YOU IDIOT. THIS NEGRO IS CLAY'S MAMMY. HE LOVES HER MORE THAN ANYONE ON THIS PLACE. HE TOLD ME I COULD QUESTION HER. WELL, HE DIDN'T SAY YOU COULD DO THAT. NOW, GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! OH, MY LORD. KITCHEL, I BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO PAY A VISIT TO THE LOCAL FOOT-WASHERS. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THEY ALWAYS HAVE THEIR FINGERS IN THE STEW. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE QUAKER PREACHER, HE AIN'T GONNA DO YOU NO GOOD. WE STOPPED HIM ON THE ROAD THIS MORNING, AND HE WAS MAKING A FUNERAL OUT TO POINT PLEASANT. COME ON, THEY GOT A FULL DAY RIDE ON US. I DIDN'T GET THERE UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE, MR. CLAY. JOHNSON BEAT HER BAD. SHE'S ASKING FOR YOU. LEAVE US. [ INDIGO MOANING ] INDIGO, IT'S ME, SHERMAN. I'M HERE. MASSA, YOU GONNA GIVE OLD INDIGO HER WISH? YOU GONNA LET MY BOY GO? I'M SORRY, INDIGO. I'M JUST SO SORRY. [ GROAN ] DON'T CRY, LITTLE MASSA. OLD INDIGO GOT A SWEET CORN CAKE FOR YOU. YOU RUN ON OUTSIDE AND PLAY WITH MY ELROI. HE A GOOD BOY. YOU AND HIM GONNA BE FINE YOUNG MEN SOMEDAY. [ SOBBING ] INDIGO. MAMMY. MAMMY. YOU SHOULD TRY TO REST, MY LOVE. WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. I REMEMBER THE DAY SHE WAS BORN. I SWORE I'D ALWAYS PROTECT HER. WELL, WE'LL LET ELROI DO THAT NOW. EVERYTHING'S CHANGED, ELIZABETH. I LOOK AT MYSELF AND DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW I AM. WELL, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. POINT PLEASANT UP AHEAD. THE BOAT SHOULD BE WAITING FOR YOU ABOUT A MILE NORTH OF THERE, BEHIND A THICKET OF TREES. WHOA. WE GOT A ROAD BLOCK. AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THROUGH. GOOD DAY, NEIGHBORS. VIRGINIA STATE MARSHAL, REVEREND. WHERE ARE YOU HEADED WITH THOSE CASKETS? MIDDLEPORT. I'M TAKING THEM FOR BURIAL ON FAMILY LAND. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? SLAVE ESCAPE, TWO DAYS AGO OUTSIDE OF NEWCASTLE. A MAN, A WOMAN, TWO SLAVE-RUNNERS. I'M SURE THAT DOESN'T TROUBLE A GOOD QUAKER LIKE YOURSELF, THOUGH. MY FAITH FORBIDS ME TO LIE, SIR, SO I CAN HONESTLY SAY, I WISH YOUR RUNAWAYS WELL. REVEREND, ARE YOU HIDING FUGITIVES IN THOSE CASKETS? FUGITIVES? NO. WELL, YOU DON'T MIND IF WE TAKE A LOOK, THEN, SEEING AS YOU'RE NOT A LIAR. DEFILING THE DEAD IS AN ABOMINATION BEFORE GOD. HEH HEH! KITCHEL, OPEN THEM. I'LL JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH MY CONSCIENCE. I'LL JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH MY CONSCIENCE. OH, GOOD GOD. PLEASE ACCEPT OUR APOLOGIES, REVEREND. THIS WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. CLOSE UP THAT COFFIN SO THE REVEREND CAN BE ON HIS WAY. WAIT. JOHNSON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THIS WAGON'S GOT A FALSE BOTTOM, MARSHAL. WHERE ARE THEY? AIDING AND ABETTING RUNAWAY SLAVES IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE AGAINST THE VIRGINIA CODE, SIR. I ANSWER TO A HIGHER LAW THAN THE VIRGINIA CODE. THEY'RE HERE. FIND THEM. COME ON. I AIN'T NEVER SEEN NO WAGON OUTRUN NO MAN ON A GOOD HORSE. WE'VE GOT TO TRY. WE CAN'T GET THIS CLOSE AND NOT TRY. NO, SIR. NOW, YOU LET ME STAY BEHIND, AND I'LL CAUSE A RUCKUS. ELROI, NO. KEEP THEM BUSY WHILE YOU GO FOR THE BOAT. WE'RE ALL GONNA GO TOGETHER. LET'S GO. [ HORSE WHINNIES ] HERE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT WAGON? GIDDYAP! GODSPEED, FRIENDS, GODSPEED. HYAH, COME ON. GET UP, HYAH, GET UP. HYAH, HYAH, HYAH! GET UP, GET UP! COME ON! OH! MARY. YOU STAY HERE, MA'AM. NO! MARY! JAMES, IT'S JOHNSON! MARY! GET OUT OF HERE. GET TO THE RIVER. NO, JAMES! MARY! I'LL TAKE MINK AND THE GIRL. HYAH, HYAH, HYAH! THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOUR. WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? THEY'RE COMING. NOBODY'S GETTING ON NO BOAT. I'M TAKING THAT RUNAWAY BACK. [ GUN COCKS ] HOLD ON. I DON'T THINK SO, NEIGHBOR. IT'S A SHAME IT HAS TO END THIS WAY, JAMES. YOU'RE THE ONLY COLORED PERSON I EVER FELT AN OUNCE OF RESPECT FOR. NOW, GET UP HERE. I'M TAKING MY WIFE BACK TO VIRGINIA. GET UP HERE! STEP ASIDE. NO! YOU...LOW-DOWN...DIRTY... SON OF A...BITCH! DADDY! DADDY, STOP. STOP! NOT WORTH IT. LIKE I SAID, BOY... I'M TAKING HER BACK. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KILL ME. 'CAUSE THIS "BOY" WILL DIE A WHOLE LOT BETTER MAN THAN YOU EVER WERE. COME ON. I'LL BE DAMNED. COME ON, BABY, LET'S GO HOME. LET'S GO, COME ON. MAMA. OH, MAMA. EVERYBODY IN THE BOAT. LET'S GO. QUICKLY. [ MUSIC BUILDS ] [ WOMAN HUMMING SPIRITUAL ]
