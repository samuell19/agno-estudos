Have some soup Luciana, Luciana. Hi, how are you? Please, come we need to talk. The pastor says we should follow the Lord's word. I don't know how to say this. Your son Luis is taking my José down the wrong path I don't know anything about that. But you're the one who guides him. Look, I'll try to talk to him, but I really don't know. But... Luciana! Luciana! - Luciana, take this, please. - No thanks. Honey, honey. Let's go to Ronny's house this afternoon. He went to Antigua, they'll be back tomorrow. We can be alone there. When are you taking me to Antigua? Next weekend, Ok? You keep promising but we never go José! José! I'm short on cash. - Alright? - Will you really take me? - Yes, darling. - What's the problem? You're playing around again I'm fed up with you. Your mother asked me to keep an eye on you I am already busy! You think I don't know you sneak out sometimes? You are paid to work. You have to do your job. I don't know what to do, I don't understand you. Gosh! Do you want to? You think I don't want things to be normal? Normal? Yes, because this isn't normal. It's not normal that you won't come with me. If you really love me, it's an easy choice. I do love you. But you're not showing it to me. What can I do? Leave my mom alone? I can't. Don't think for a moment that I don't want to. We're young. We can work hard I'm a construction worker. I can build a small house for us. We can work together and save up, and build an even better one. I want us to have a better life. The city's growing, we can have a decent life here. Shit, José, you're so stubborn! So, if you want to stay, stay I'm out of here. If that's what you want, I'm gone. All I want is for us to be happy. I want to be happy with you too. And I'm happy with you here, it doesn't matter where I don't understand why we have to run away. Why the fuck do you want to stay here?! I'm asking you where you want to go. Anywhere but Guatemala. But I told you. I can get over this I'll have to get used to not being with you. My love for you... It's unlike anything I felt before. I love my Mother too. I love her, and always will. But the love I feel for you... This is shit, José. Take care of him, please. He's a good boy. Don't let anything happen to him. Son? - Son. - Mom. You're here! Test me any way.

He could use your baby clothes. You should visit Grandma soon. Twenty days after classes started we still don't have school lunches, school supplies, or textbooks. That's why we're here, to demand that the President and the Minister of Education comply with the National Education law and the Constitution and supply our boys and girls with everything they need to get an education. It's impossible to educate boys and girls who are malnourished, in dirty schools, with difficult access to school including schools that don't have roofs, or don't have walls. That's precisely why we are here. It's necessary for the President and his ministers to listen... The green one That one, let me try it. - This? - The red one. - It's sweet sauce. - Sweet sauce?

Sunsets are beautiful here. Would you like to see the sunset here everyday? Sure. Sit down. This place is practically mine. I paid half already. I like you, José. Come live with me. Come on, let me help you. You can go back to school. Or you can take dance classes. Wouldn't you like that? I don't know what I want. We're going to get old one day. Who's going to take care of us? Get it! Goal! That's it! - Hey. - What's up? Come on, let's go. Get it! Get it! Get it! Come on. There it goes again. Get the ball. What the fuck! - Stop that! - Relax, man! José! José!

Mom said you never saw him again. He disappeared. One day he didn't come home. I looked for him for a long time. I waited for him. It was torture. How did you bear with it? I got used to it. A lot of people died, a lot of people never came back. After the war, many disappeared. Why didn't you marry again? I met some men. One of them, lasted a couple of years. But he was married. He had a family, and I had to take care of your Mom. Good afternoon Do you know this guy? He's a construction worker. - No. - Thank you. Good afternoon Do you know this guy?
