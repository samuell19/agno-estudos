Yea, alright. God bless. Bye. - Hey, easy. - Oh sorry. Hi Hi, I wasn't expecting to bump into anyone. - Are you leaving? - No no. Not at all. I was wondering what was keeping you out here. So I came to check on you. Make sure you were safe. Alright, just kidding. I wanted to stretch my legs and I noticed you hadn't had some of the famous pie and no drink either, so I brought you some. You do know stale food can make you sick, right? Okay, thanks for the nutrition lesson. Are you a doctor? No, not even, just a concerned friend, I guess. Right. You gonna take it or what? Oh yes, yes, sorry. - Thanks. Yes. - Yea? - No pie? - I had to… - No - Okay. I had to step out to make a phone call. The call must have been important. - Yes it was. - Was it business? Do you usually ask these many questions of people you just met? The thing is, Charlie talks about you, like, all the time. So, in my mind, we're already friends. Friends. There's that word again. Do you have a problem being friends? - No comment. - No... Spoken like a true lawyer. Oh, wow. Okay, fine, Charlie has really spoken about me a lot. What about you? What do you do? Err, this and that… Alright, I'm an investment banker. - I work on Wall Street. - Wow. You know I was thinking you were like... - an actor or model or something like that. Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh, but you think I could pass for an actor? What is it? My eyebrows, or my perfect leading man looks? Which one? Uhmm.. I'm gonna go back inside, okay? Sure. I'm hoping you're gonna get to stay home a lot longer this time. I hope so too. - Hi, Lollipop. - Oh, there you are. I was beginning to wonder where you guys went to. - I needed to use my phone, to call, just... Right. Everything okay? Ejike! How are you doing? Mum, can you try knocking once in a while? It's that thing that p… Come in mum, good morning. Make yourself comfortable. Did you sleep well? I did, actually. How was your night? We thank God. Your father called this morning, but it was too early, so didn't want to wake you up. He was expecting your call last night. Right, I actually meant to call him. Sorry, I got in really late last night and I was really tired. - I'm going to Abuja. - Okay. You're home, I want you to come with me. I will be fine And besides, Charlie and I actually have a couple of meetings here, so next weekend. And when are we going to get to meet this your mysterious friend? You'll meet him soon. We're just a little busy right now, that's all. Hmm Okay, so it's more important to have these meetings with your mysterious friends than go and visit your father? I did not say that, alright? Okay, so when you finish with your meetings, come to Abuja. Okay. What's going on? Come on tell me, why are you so intent on me coming to Abuja, What's happening? Is it a bad thing to go and visit your father? No of course not. But you literally just said, he's busy doing his political stuff. So why do I need to be there so badly? - Okay. - Okay. Stay for your meetings. I mean... You never listen to what I say. Here we go. I really don't know why I bother! Okay, look. Mum, mum, mum! Where are you going? Goodness. Okay. Okay, look, let's do this. We will spend this weekend together We will do some fun stuff then you can go to Abuja on Sunday. And when I'm done with my meetings here, I... I will come join you. That's a good idea. Oh, and I know the perfect place to take you. - Ohh! - Oh dear Lord. - This will be fun. - What did I get myself into? Good morning, Brother Ejike. I hope you are enjoying your trip to Nigeria. So far, so good. How far? You are looking good. Tunde is taking really good care of you. Hmm! That one? Do I even get to see him? He is always off to one political thing or the other. That's a good thing because it means politics is actually working out for him. Hmmn, well yes. I guess he's trying to be like your father. Hoping one day to become Senate President. Yeah, that would be something. But look, listen I just had like the weirdest conversation with my mum. She's trying a little too hard to get me to go to Abuja. I feel like there's something else going on. What is it? Why do you think so? Hey, come on, we both know that woman. She doesn't do anything for no reason. - What's going on? Ah, I don't know. - Come on. - Come to think of it. Maybe she wants to find you a wife as you've refused to bring one home. - You guys are trying to find me a wife? - Hmm-mmn I can find a woman by myself. Thank you so much. Okay, then you better hurry up and bring one home. You know Aunty does not take "No" for an answer. Yeah, I can't even deal with you guys, alright? - I will see you later. - Okay. Don't bother coming to Abuja again. He won't even consider it. Perfect. Don't worry about it. I'll bring him over to Abuja next week. - We'll see you there. - Hello, Aunty. Hello yourself. Nma, haven't I told you to stop sneaking up on me? I didn't sneak up on you. I walked leisurely in. Did you see Sisi Toyin when you picked up Kemi? Uhhm no, it was really early in the morning, so she might have been sleeping when I got there. I didn't go upstairs, so I don't know. Oh, that's okay. I... guess I'll call her later. I can't make Bible study today. I'm sure she wouldn't mind. I mean she knows Charlie's around, so... - Oh, speaking of Charlie, - hmm-mm His friend seemed like a... nice boy. Yeah, he is. I saw the way he was looking at you. Mum, don't start jumping the gun now. I'm not jumping the gun, and I'm not saying anything that I didn't see. All I'm saying is, I saw the way he was looking at you and I bet you anything, he'll be here soon enough. I'm sure he will be here soon enough, mum. I mean, Charlie is his friend. So yes, he will come back. That is not what I meant, but never mind. Trust me, he'll be back. Mum, you know I'm not looking for a relationship right now. All I want to do is focus on God and my career, that's it. Hmmn Honey, you do realize you're only saying that because... you haven't met the right man yet? When you do, just like I did meet your father, - Hmmm? - Everything will fall into place. You don't have to be single to serve God, you can serve him while married. I did, and so are countless women out there. All you have to do is just open your heart to the will of God. All you have to do is just open your heart to the will of God. - Oh, stop. Ok mum, I've heard you. You've literally been on your phone since I got here, is everything okay? Ah, I'm tired, my cousin promised to call me for a business proposition I made to him. Oh, is this the cousin you were telling me about? The one that's in the States? When am I meeting him? You'll meet him soon. He's quite busy at the moment. He and one of his friends are trying to set up venture capital for businesses in Nigeria, he can impact lots of Nigerians. Wow! That is such a strange coincidence. Charlie and his friend are literally doing the same thing. - Really? - Yes. Maybe we should introduce them. What do you think? Probably after Teni's wedding or what do you think? Yes, that's a good idea. So, what does Charlie's friend look like? He's hot. Very hot. Well, do I smell an attraction? Kemi, am I not allowed to just admire someone without you thinking that there is something there? Okay, now give me the details, full details. I want to listen. Well, he did make a really good first impression. Hmmph! Gala gala gala gala This is ridiculous, man! It's like the one thing about Lagos that never changes You know we've been here for… Look at that, we've been here for an hour. And we've moved I'm pretty sure about five meters. It makes no sense. You would think that after all this time, the government would have figured out new modes of transportation to ease the congestion on the roads - -Hold on Err, ok, Pastor Ben just confirmed our meeting - So we're good to go. - Oh, awesome, awesome. What about the Centre for Law and Business? Any word from them? Oh no, they confirmed yesterday so we have two meetings lined up now. - Great. - Yeah, man Sir, please buy from me, buy, please. - How much? - 100 Naira each, sir. Do you want something? I'm not really hungry. It's fine, I don't mind. - Let me ask you something. - Okay, sir. - Did you go to school? - No, sir. - You never went to school? - Yes. How come? Sir, no money … Look at my beards I haven't eaten since morning, sir. Please buy, please. Do you have any Naira on you? No, unfortunately not. Err, hold on, I should have some change somewhere. Okay, just give me one. Emeka, bring a paper bag for me. - It's fine, keep the change. - God bless you. Sir, thank you so much. Emeka! So what's this mystery man's name? - Keme. - Keme? Keme, sounds romantic. Lola and Ke... Kemi! There is no by Lola and Keme or Loke or whatever happening, please. Okay, it's fine. So what's happening tomorrow morning? Are we still on for the market? Yes we are. Bright and early, so you need to be ready. - So set your alarm. But Lola, please, why can't Teni just hire a professional wedding planner? I don't have to wake up every weekend for this please. Kemi, why are you complaining? - You know, you like it. - I don't. So how did it go at the market? I hope you got all you wanted. Oh yes, we did. Lola has such an eye for beautiful stuff. Must you give Lola so much credit? You are as talented as she is, if not more. It's okay, mum, I am confident in my abilities and I do not have a problem with recognizing how gifted Lola is. But mum, where is this coming from? I'm just tired of "Lola this, Lola that", you deserve some credit too. Ok, thanks for looking out for me, mum, but I am super cool with Lola. I don't know how you can be. After the stunt she pulled with Femi. - She ruined your engagement. - Oh come on, mum we both know it wasn't Lola's fault. Femi is such a horrible person Lola did nothing wrong. Well, that's not how I remember it. It's fine, but I think we'll... agree to disagree then. - I'm sorry. - What happened? I'm sorry, sorry, I'm just coming. The traffic in this town is... terrible Third mainland was blocked. We had to go through Yaba and Eko bridge. Thank God for Lola who knows all the ways. Well then, how is... Lola? She's great, I suppose. Yes, definitely. Your sister is, she is something else. Yea, I think so too. Why do you sound like that? Why do you have that look on your face, Keme? Alright, fine, fine. Since we're here and we're doing this Yes, I've been actually meaning to talk to you about this. - Hmmn... - I know it's kind of weird, but I like her As in, I really like her. You think she would agree to go on a date with me? Why don't you ask her? Wait, you are actually cool with this? No, I'm not. - Oh my bad. - I'm just kidding, come on. I can't think of nobody better. Hey man, I appreciate this, seriously. - -No, seriously. - It means a lot to me. - No problem, no problem. - I won't let you down. - Oh, no wahala. - Let's get to business. - Alright. We are ready to see her now, if you can just give her a ring. Tell her we're here. Iya Dundun. Please, let me have three wraps of amala, and meat. - Okay, how many meats? - Uhmm... Two each. Make it goat meat and beef, okay? Any ponmo? These ones are ajebo, they can't eat ponmo, just... No, no, no, I will have some ponmo, thank you very much. - -Why not? Mehn, how's the… - Thank you. - Thank you, man. How's the wedding planning going? - Maaan! It's going good - Yes. I learned something very early on. What's that? The wedding belongs to the bride. I simply do as I'm told and we're all happy. So I hear. And Lola is doing an amazing job. Of course, she's amazing. I don't know how she finds the time to do all the things she gets to do. It's like she can out plan any event planner in the world. - That's crazy. - I tell you what? I mean, all of her creativity and style, - Simple, but classy. - Classy, yes. She just seems like that kind of person, you know? She's just that kind of person, that's all. - Hmm! - Hmm! Why do you have that look on your face? Hey, you think we didn't see how you were staring at her the other night? Are you guys being serious right now? I can't say someone is incredible anymore, I can't just compliment your sister in peace. - This is the food, let's dig in. - Yes good idea. So? I could actually get into this. - It's actually pretty nice. - Not bad at all. The amala is soft, the soup tastes really delicious. - It's pretty good, actually. - Hmm! Iya Dundun is the best. So, guys, this is my business idea. Joshua, buka? You want to open a buka? Listen up guys. It is a bukateria par excellence. What I'm trying to do is blend the local traditional buka with the modern-day fast food joint. - That could actually work. - Yeah. Ah, who do we have here? Ehhhh! Hello. - Awww, how are you? - I'm fine, thank you. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Good to see you. - Same here. How are you? - I'm okay. - Good. Business is looking good. - Thank you. - Well done. Thank you, thank you. Ah, Auntie Lola! Efe, I didn't know you were in town now. - How are you? - I'm fine o, I'm fine. That's good. How is the job search going? You know Nigeria, my dear. If you're not connected with people in high places, you can be sure, your hope of getting a job is very slim. But you know, we are children of God, so Efe, your own case will be different. Amen. Although, I just got a job as a security guard to a politician's wife. A friend of mine recommended me, and I should start soon, by next week. I mean... I just I really hope they are good. Not the one they'll come and turn you into a thug. Ah, God forbid. - Never, My son? Never. - God forbid Just don't do that. - Allow me to kill this evil child. - Don't you have shame? You want to kill your daughter? Why won't I kill her? This girl is a demon child. She is an Ogbanje child. She has been taking all my money to the coven. And this same child has been collapsing my businesses, and everything that I put my hands into. And you think killing your child will solve your financial troubles? Yes Madam. At least no body will be taking my money to the coven. It's okay, thank you. - I'll take her, you don't have to worry... - You can have her. What kind of a man are you? Byebye! Eh, what's this torture? I don't know how you do it. - Do what? - Give, give, and give. It is my Christian duty as a believer. If I don't, who will? This is what we are called to do. Do you even know her name? We'll look for a name for her, and have her dedicated in the church. You know... What do you think about Esther? Esther, that's a lovely name. The orphan who became a queen. Madam Eloha... it's so beautiful. You've really outdone yourself this time. Teni is gonna be so happy, honestly. - Thank you. - We thank God, we thank God. I will get the reception dress ready by tomorrow evening. - Thank you. - Okay. And by the way, when are we getting the invitation to your wedding? Well... there is someone. Yes, I met him through Charlie… - Wow. - And I think he likes me. Wow. - Do you like him? - Yes. Is he a born again? Have you prayed about it? In that case, what... are you waiting for? Please just hold this one, okay? Just use it to buy food and clothes for the little one, please. Thank you very much, Lola. You've been very good to my family and I. Thank you so much. The Lord will replenish your purse. Amen, amen. - Ready for this? - Please... Bro, you have no idea what is about to hit you. - I get it. - Thank you so much. - When you're done boasting... - No no no. Just because I don't live here anymore doesn't mean I don't know how whoop your behind. One, two, three, come on. Okay, Okay. - Keep going - That's it. - Hey. Hey. - Let me get that for you. - Oh, thank you. That's... really sweet of you. Great to see you again. Great to see you too, Lola. What's going on? You seem like you had a busy day. Really busy day. I had to pick up the bridesmaid's dresses You know, for the wedding. - Right - You're coming to the wedding, right? Uhh, I will, yes, if you promise to save me a dance. Uhhmm... I don't know because it's gonna be really hectic with the whole wedding and my friend's not around. So, it's just, I don't know. That's too bad, because that's my condition If I'm gonna attend. - Uhhmm... - Come on. - Just one dance? - One dance. Seriously, one dance. - Okay, fine. - Yes? Wonderful. Now I can start looking forward to this wedding. And you my darling sister has just been played. You know he was going to come to wedding anyway, right? And who told you that I wasn't playing him? Bye guys. Keme! - Right! - Sit! Whose turn, whose turn? What did I tell you? Uhmm, I don't remember, Mum. What did you tell me? Didn't I tell you that he was going to come back? Really? Alright, fine, mom, you did tell me. You were right. So... did he say anything? Well, he wants me to dance with him at Teni's wedding. And? - I agreed. - You agreed. Well, that's a surprise. Sounds like you like him too, huh? Mum, slow down, slow down. Look, we're gonna take this one step at a time, ok? It's just a dance. - Oh, I'm not rushing. - Yes, you are . I just figured Take a date now and you never know. - Wedding? Baby? - Mum! Ah! Wait, why did it get quiet all of a sudden? No, no, no, we are innocent boys. Well Keme, I hope your parents won't mind that you're gonna spend time with us. For dinner? Oh yes, that would be fantastic. It smells really good. My parents are in Abuja, so they're not gonna mind. Oh great. What... do they do exactly? My dad works for the government and my mum is a business woman. Oh that's nice. What kind of businesswoman is she? Mum, can you please stop interrogating him? You'll chase him away before dinner. That's what you call getting to know someone lately? - It's interrogation? I won't want to... run you out of here, but I just want to remind you that get your palates ready My daughter is preparing a lovely dinner, Sweet potato porridge with fresh fish. That sounds very tasty. I'm looking forward to dinner already. Right? She's a great cook. - Right? - Mum, yes, yes, yes, she is a great cook. Sure. She is. My mum. Hello Charlie, you're welcome. - And Ejikeme, you're welcome. - Nice to see you, sir. - Good to see you guys. - Thank you Hello sir. - So great to see you. - Thank you. And I'm so delighted that you have a great interest in RILA, - Helping us to promote RILA. - Yes, yes. You are welcome, do sit down. Thank you for having us. - Thank you so much. - You are welcome. We applaud what you are doing - with the academy - Yes. And we would like to partner with you to expand the courses and maybe bring a few campuses to the United States. If possible, yes. - That's the plan - That's the plan This is great, Charlie and Ejikeme. Great news to my ears. I must sincerely thank you, because we have been looking for partners, strategic partners, to help us advance the cause of what we are doing globally. Okay. That's actually perfect, then, because we just felt that coming now was a bit of the right time. We're really interested in the course that focuses on building apostles in the marketplace. - Yes Yes Yes. - Yes, we felt that that kind of thing would really hit our target demographic. Yes, we would like to, you know, set up strategic meetings with church leaders across the United States. - Great. - And then have you come over To talk in some of these churches, - To share the RILA vision... - Share the message. - Yes. - Beautiful, beautiful. That's great, because... that is the major area of our focus. We're raising Christian leaders who function in the marketplace. And your coming is like the biblical story of Aaron and Hur in the Bible. - -that lifted up the hands of Moses Yes Yes. In battle until the victory was won. Absolutely. The Lord will greatly bless you - Amen. - For taking this step. - Thank you so much - Thank you. So if it is alright with you, we just wanted to run you by a couple of the strategies that we have for making this work. - So, that was interesting. - Yes, I think we're making progress Yes Yes. I think so. Where's the driver? I don't know, I have no idea. He's probably parked somewhere else. You know how hard it is getting parking... Alright, what are you doing for the rest of the day? Josh. - I have to see Josh. - Okay, You guys have the wedding vows to make - Yes - Yes, I don't think I'm trying to do that, - so you guys have fun. And I'll find something to do. - Alright man. - I'll just take a walk. - Take it easy, huh? - Alright. Lola. Keme. Hi. Fancy meeting you here. Hey. - What's up? - I'm good. What are you doing here? I just finished a meeting with Charlie. We had the RILA thing so we just came from there, but he had to go do something with Joshua, for the wedding. So, I'm kind of bored, I was just strolling around. What are you doing here? Oh! My office is literally just there, around the corner. - Okay. Alright. - Yea Uhhm... Do you want some yoghurt? I don't mind. Frozen yoghurt. Ok, alright. What do we have here? Alright, you can get the strawberry. I think I'm gonna try... sweet kiwi. Yea, that's me. Thanks for the treat. My pleasure. No, I should be the one saying that. I've actually enjoyed spending time with you. - Likewise. - Likewise? Alright, I've enjoyed spending time with you too. - There we go, it wasn't so hard. Uhhm... So listen, you think we can do this again, sometime? Yes. Yeah, because I'm trying to get to know you a little better. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take you on a date or two or three. Let's start with one. Okay. Alright, we can do one. How about Sunday, after church? Let's have lunch. - It's a date. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, perfect. Okay... What's happening? Why do you have that look on your face? All is well. It's just that Otunba Ayodeji has asked your father to be his running mate in the next elections. Ok, that's… Dad, Congratulations, that's amazing But I'm pretty that the election literally just ended. The next one is in four years? Yes, definitely. The election cycle runs immediately. Four years, yes. Ok, so he's asked you to be his running mate in four years. Yes. You see, we... have to put this like in lock down, so that he doesn't change his mind. And that is why we have arranged for you to marry his only daughter. That way, two powerful families, become a formidable dynasty. Wait. Come on guys, we're... joking, right? Do we look like we're joking? Okay. Let me umm, Let me understand this. You want me to marry someone. As in actually "marry someone", someone's daughter, because you want to secure a running mate postion, four years down the line? Oh no, son, son, son. Don't take it like that, it might sound weird but you see, this is a family decision. How is this a family decision, dad? This has nothing to do with family. This is about you and I'm sorry but this is about you and your ambition, that's fine. You want to be president one day, that's okay. But why do I have to be the sacrificial lamb? Oh, stop being so dramatic. Nobody is trying to sacrifice you. I mean, this is an alliance of two families for the benefit of both sides. Okay. I thought you would know me better by now, but I can only marry somebody that God has actually destined for me, mum. If I am going to get married it has to be the will of God. Ejike, I understand you. You are born again. - I am. - And you believe in the... will of God. - I do. - But... so do I. - So do we. - So what are you saying? We believe in the will of God. And you have not seen this girl. She is beautiful, elegant, classy, and she is successful. Look, I have her on my Facebook. She's on your Facebook? Guys, can you can you… Mum, dad, can you not hear yourselves? It sounds like a bad comedy. Can you please put that phone down? She can be Miss world, Miss universe Miss everything rolled into one, but it's not gonna happen. Ok mum, I'm sorry. And dad, let me you ask for something. Let's say I marry this girl, okay? We actually get married and then, four years down the line, Otunba decides, "Hey, I need someone more strategic as a partner." then he dumps you. What happens to me? I will divorce her immediately, I'll pay for the divorce. Wow! I love you both. But sometimes I cannot deal with you. You do realize these are people's lives that you're discussing. Oh, stop making it sound so evil. Everybody does this. But I'm not everyone, and neither are you. So what do we… Look, mum, dad, Maybe this doesn't make sense to you, I get that. But I'm the son of the most high God, okay? And I have to at least try to be led by the Spirit, not the flesh. So I... refuse to play these games with you. Did you just say you refuse? You refuse? Who the hell do you think you are? I am your father. Now, these same strategies you dismiss as games, That has paid your fees and made you whoever you are. You will obey me! Look, dad, mum, I love you both, okay? I'm sure you both know that, but you can't force me to do this. Look, I'm 30 years old, okay? And I haven't lived at home in the last decade. So, with all due respect, sir, I don't have to do anything. I can find a God-fearing wife Nice and pretty, all by myself. Thank you. What did you think of the show? It was... interesting. I do think some of the girls should have been a little more modestly dressed though Well, that's how these girls dress nowadays. But the designer is very talented. - Hi! - Hi, Wande. Hello, darling. Hey! - Hi. - Hey I'm Wande, nice to meet you. Hi Ejike. Sorry about that. You know my mum? Yes I do, I do. - Okay. - Yeah. Oh right, you're the designer. - This is your collection, right? - Yes I am.

So, I'm actually going to a 60th birthday party myself - Really? - Hmmn And who is it? Do you remember Charlie's friend, Keme? - The hot guy now. - Ahnahn! Oh my God.

What can I say, bro? Mum, hi. These are my friends. This is Charlie, we work together, and this is his sister, Lola. Good evening Ma. - Charlie. - Ma? Welcome to our home. Thank you very much, ma'am. Ejike has told us so much about you, but he failed to mention your sister. Yes, her name is Lola. This is Lola. - I met you. - Yes Ma. At the fashion show? You were at the fashion show? I was only there for a little while. Just to pick my mum. Oh. Okay. Anyway, you should meet my dad. You should meet my dad, yes. - No. - Come on. You get them a drink, you know, let your father finish with the Otunba. And then we will do the introductions. Excuse me. How are you? - We'll meet him later. - Hey you, introduce me to your friends. - Ok, this is Charlie. - Yes. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Charlie, this is Wande. And Wande, this is Lola. Your father is the Honorable Chukwuemeka, and you didn't think that was something that you should have told me? Yeah, look, I'm trying to be me, okay? I don't want to walk around town as Chukwuemeka's son. I don't like that thing. I see. Nice to meet you. Can I speak with you for a minute? Yes, sure. Well, look at you. We're in trouble. Ejike gave that girl the necklace, mum's necklace What girl? His friend's sister. So? Mum said that he should give the necklace to the woman he plans to marry. We cannot go ahead with the plans for today, Or else Ejike will blow up and ruin everything. How can I…? Otunba is anxious to make a statement now. Stall him, let me think about something. Okay, hurry up, Nneka. But I thought you said you were working on him. Yes, well, I am I wasn't expecting this girl. Look, I promised to make you president and I will. I mean... we are so close now. Nothing is going to stop us. - This party seems cool - Hey Yeah, man. Thank you for coming. Welcome to my little corner. - Hey hey, please. - Small. Hey, please, we are a poor family Keep saying that At some point, you'll believe it. Keep saying that. No, no, this is tiny. - Kemi. - Lola and Charlie. Cuzzo. - How are you? - Hey. What are you guys doing here? - Is this the party you were invited to? - Yes. - Wait, this is your uncle's house? - Yes. - So he's your... - Ejike, my cousin. Keme, Keme. Right, just one second. How are you? I didn't know you were coming. Yes, my full name is Ejikeme, Chukwuemeka. I'll explain later. Ok, you know what? I don't know what's going on here, but... wait a minute. So Keme, if you're the only son, then who exactly... Uhhm Thank you very much, friends and family, Thank you so much for coming to celebrate with me today. I thank God for making me to see today. - I am 60 years old, It's not a joke. - My joy is double. When I received a splendid news from my son, Ejikeme, before this party. It is with my utmost pleasure... Dad, please. And joy to announce the engagement of my only son, Ejikeme, - to Wande Ayodeji the only daughter of Otunba Ayodeji, thank you. Thank you, thank you. It's not what you think. Hold on, hold on, hold on let me explain to you - Let go, I'm fine, - It's okay. What is going on here? Mum, not now, please. Ejike, don't be rude. Otunba wants to understand what is going on here. Mum, that's his problem not mine, okay? Can you get this girl out of my house? - Lola! - Let's go, let's go talk Lola, oya, come and be going. Charlie, go and drop her. She's... not going anywhere. Ok, mum, she's here on my invitation. - So she gets to stay. - Lola, for the first time in your life, don't make this about you. Don't come and cause trouble in this family. Lola, we know each other. You better leave now before I expose you. Expose her? This is the girl you knew since she was a baby. You don't know her! I know exactly who she is, thank you very much. You don't know who she is. Her M.O is to take other people's men. How dare you? This is all a lie. What did she do to you that is so bad That you'll say such hurtful things about her? Why not? That's how she met Femi for the first time. - Ah. - Eh, immediately. Femi started running after her day and night. The most painful part of this whole thing is this girl did not even like the Femi, but.. she just decided to ruin Kemi's life. Mum, what has gotten over you? Femi was just a horrible guy. Stop defending her. For once in your life, hold this girl responsible. Hold her responsible for what she did to you. Ejike Chukwuemeka, this is the girl you want to bring into my family? This prostitute. Ah! Mum! Lola, wait! - Mum, why do you... - Kinni? Lola, wait, wait. Sorry, sorry. Please. Look, Lola, just let me explain, okay? I am sorry about that, you didn't deserve to go through that. Why did you invite me here? I wanted my parents to meet you. Look, I meant it when I… Lola, I love you. - You lied to me. - I didn't lie, okay? Yes, I omitted the fact that I am my father's son, but - it's not a lie. - An omission... is still a lie. I don't know who you are. You told me that you are someone else, I don't know you. I'm the same guy you met... The same guy What does it matter what my last name is? Who are you? Please, I don't know who you are. Who are you? And who is Wande? And what does she have to do with all of this? Okay, hold up. The Wande thing, that's just my mum being crazy. I'll explain later, but... you are the only person I care about. Lola, I'm the same guy. Ok, the same guy that fell in love with you, literally seconds after meeting you. I am the same guy who's standing here asking you, begging you. Forgive me... Please. I need some... space. Look, I need to understand what's going on, I don't understand, I'm confused. Look, I need some space, please. OK. Fine. I'll give you space. But I meant it when I said I loved you. So, don't expect too much space. I'm gonna go get Charlie to take you home. I'm never giving up on us, Lola. Never. I'll be right back. What is the meaning of this, Ejikeme or Keme, or whatever your name actually is? Bro, it's still me, okay? I wasn't trying to lie to anyone. It's just that I don't like announcing he's my father, that's all. I was trying to distance myself from my parents' name, that's it. That's all well and good but all I care about right now, is my sister. You told me you loved her. Are you serious? I mean that more than you'll ever know. And I do intend to marry her. So why then are your parents announcing your engagement to this person? Who is she? And what's going on here, Keme? I have no idea what happened back there, okay? I was completely blindsided. This is like the… what… second time I'm meeting that girl. I don't even know her like that. I'm not going to marry her. Well, Kemi says that the whole family has known about this for months. Why would your own family do this to you? Yes, my family is crazy. Okay? I don't know how else to explain it, okay? Otunba Ayodeji has asked my father to be his running mate, four years down the line, which I thought would be crazy. But hey, my parents want to lock down the position, so they want me to marry his only daughter, which makes no sense. But that's just how they think, okay? They told me about it, I said: "No" obviously. But they didn't listen, so here we are. Trust me, I had no idea that was gonna happen. I promise you. They must not have heard me or they just didn't care because... now, there's this. Keme, this is a nightmare, and my sister is caught in the middle of it, fix it. I know, okay. And bro, I promise you, I'll sort all of this, okay? Better sort it or you'll answer to me. I am really sorry about the other night. I had no idea you were not aware of the arrangement. For what it's worth, I think she means well. Yes, she wants people to think that. Look, I have to ask you, why are you going along with this? I mean, come on, Wande, you are young, you are accomplished, you are really beautiful. You don't need anyone to set up a marriage for you. This is what I'm groomed for, okay? Besides, it's way easier this way, 'cos I know who I'm dealing with and it is clear you are not after dad's money. Errr, fair enough. Do you really think I'm beautiful? Wande, I think you are a lovely person, I actually mean that. You are really beautiful, but... I fell in love with someone already, okay? And I actually intend to marry Lola. I am sad, honestly, because I really think we could be good together. But it seems she's a nice girl. She is, she is, she is. She is amazing. Okay. Look, I'm glad we had this talk. - Me too. - Okay. I'm sorry things didn't work out. No hard feelings. Thanks for being honest. - Okay, no problem. - Okay. I'll see you around? - Yes, good - OK. Hi Mum. How did it go? How did what go? How did you find Wande? Uhhm, she's a nice person, but she is not the one for me, alright? Mum, I'm sorry. But you just said she's a nice person What more do you want in a wife? Mum, we've been over this. Lola, is the one for me, okay? Can we please not do this? Please? I really want to know what this Lola has given you? What kind of juju has she given you? I want to know her native doctor's name. I'm not even gonna... How can you let Wande go? I mean she's tall she's elegant, she is so well mannered. She... - Hmnn... - Did you do this? - No, I did not! - Mum, tell me the truth. But you look so good together. Mum, you have no idea what you've done. - -Lola! Lola! Lola! I Hey, can I help you, young man? Ah, sorry, sir. I am... I'm here to see Lola. Lola. I see. The woman you're about to marry does she know you are here looking for Lola? Sir, I'm not getting married to anybody except your daughter. - Is that so? - Yes sir. Go home, son! Leave my daughter alone. Listen, listen, we are simple people. - I know. - And we just don't want your trouble. - I know sir, let me explain. - We don't want your trouble at all. Daddy, please calm down. Please Hey, can we... talk for a second? Daddy, please, it's okay. If you hurt my daughter, I will make you regret the day you were born Hey, can we talk please? I'm guessing you saw the pictures online already. I couldn't have missed them even if I tried. Every time I open up a page, that's all I would see. Congratulations. - Let me... - No, no, wait, Congratulations. She is very pretty and you guys are trending, so... - Lola, just let me... - No, hold on. I saw all the hashtags. What did I see? I saw Wajike, I saw Okay, can you, please stop? I'm not marrying Wande, okay? I don't even know who posted those pictures online. My mother probably had Something to do with it, but the point is, that wasn't real. So if you're not marrying her, why would you let someone take pictures of you like that? That's what I'm trying to explain. All right, look, she came over to see me, right? We had a little talk and... I told her my heart belongs to someone else. Okay, listen to me. She was leaving, alright? She just wanted me give me a hug, goodbye, and someone decided to take pictures, That's what you saw. It wasn't real. - -Please Listen, I don't know what to believe anymore. Believe me. Alright, just say, "You will marry me." Your parents won't even accept me. I don't care! Honestly, I don't. Look, Lola, I love you. Alright. And I know that you love me too. You're still wearing my necklace. I do love you, But is that even enough? What is the point of marrying someone that you can't even build a future with because the families won't even accept it? It's going to have to be enough. Okay? Because I'm not going to stop. I'm not stopping until you are my wife. When I came to Nigeria, I came to look for businesses to invest in. I didn't come looking for a wife. Obviously, God had other plans because he led me to you and... Look, Lola, God makes everything; everything beautiful, - In his own time. Keme, please don't hurt me again. Please Make sure that no body goes out or comes in through that gate. - You hear me? - Yes sir. And then I don't want to see you inside here, okay? Yes sir. No, inside there Fool... Get away from here! Ah, aah. shior Guess who's back? Hey, uncle. How've you been? Hello, Darling. How are you? Good to see you, thank you. - Hey you! - How are you doing? - Hi, Auntie. - Hello Darling. - How are you? - I've missed you so much. - You are so pretty. - Thank you. Uhm, where's Lola? I have so much to tell her. Uhm, Lola is... nowhere to be found right now. What do you mean, she's nowhere to be found? Did she go out? Teni, Lola is missing. Ok? We have no idea where she is. How, how? People don't just get missing like that. Has anyone contacted the police? Yes, Josh. We have but there are no leads at the moment. God is our lead. He'll bring my daughter back home, where she belongs. We just have to have faith, right? Apparently she left a note with Keme saying that she was leaving and that no one should come looking for her. So that means she's alive, right? Yes? We are very sure that she didn't write that note. And Lola wouldn't just leave. Also, there were so many typos in the message. Has there been any ransom message or any ransom demand? No. There is no other communication. - I don't understand it. - Who has my daughter? And... what do they want to do with her? How is Keme handling this? Don't you dare say that name in this house. D'you understand me? Especially with what his mother and himself put my daughter through Mum, come on, you know it's not Keme's fault. He's devastated about all of this as we are. - Oh, please! - I don't care what his feelings are! The whole problem started the day he laid his eyes on her. Ugghh I told you, I have no trust in these politicians at all. Oh, my baby. - My poor baby, my poor baby. Hello. - Yes. Ok, Ok... Thank you. Thank you very much. - -Yes? - There's been a lead. - Oh go on, go on! Go, go! Stay with the family, okay? - Are you sure? - Go quickly, go quickly! My daughter's gonna be fine. Yes, Efe, where are you? I can't see you. Yes, I am on the street. I am here, I am here. I'm the one waving my hand, yes. - Alright, hurry up. - Come on. - Bros. - What's the plan? What's going on? They have her in the room at the back. They asked me not to enter the room, but when I was doing my rounds, I saw that a window was open. So I peeped and I saw auntie Lola lying on the floor. How do you know it's Lola? Bros, I know auntie Lola anyday, anytime. She has been so good to me and my family. Immediately I saw her, I called Auntie Kemi, and she said she will inform bros. Okay, we're just gonna have to go. - Yes. - And see what we can do. How many people are in there? Bros, there are three of them. But Dele is their leader. - Dele? - Yes, bros, Dele. Just go, I'm coming. Bros, please do something. No, no, no, just go open the gate. Did I not tell you not to... Ah ha! - Eh, eh - Where is she? Where is she? Where's Lola? Where is she? Arrggh! - Lola? - The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want He makes me lie down in green pastures. Lola! It's okay, it's okay, I'm here. Help me get her up. - -I know, I am here, I am here. I got you, let's get her up come on. Listen, call your dad, and tell him to meet us at his hospital. Ok? Lord, please, protect my daughter. Bless her, O Lord. O Lord, heal her. Bless the hands of the doctors. Give them wisdom and knowledge to treat her. Amen. O Lord, Let no harm come near Lola. I can't just stay here. Let me know when she is awake, okay? I'm gonna go confront my parents. Lord, we leave it in your hands oh God, please. I need to bring God in this. Well, she'll be okay. Oh... Now Charlie, tell me Where did you find her? Well, It appears Keme's mum had Lola kidnapped to keep her away from him until after his wedding to Otunba Ayodeji's daughter. - What? - She did what? Why are these people like this? Of course she did this in conjuction with your friend, Sisi Toyin. What? She fed Keme's mum the how and where to find Lola. Well, she met her match. And she did this to the wrong woman. - She will pay for this, honey. - Aunty. No, and that Keme's mother, oh she will pay for everything. They're gonna pay for everything they did to my daughter, Irrespective of her husband's political clout. I always knew this. I knew that her relationship with that boy was a wrong one. See, politicians can do and undo. Yes, And they always believe that they are above the law. Well, they are not above God's law, honey. Why would she do this to Lola? Why? Honey. Lollipop. Good to have you back with us. Hey, baby. They beat me… I was so scared I would never see you again. Shhhh, don't say that. We will never let anyone hurt you again. I'm so sorry, baby. I am so sorry. I prayed so hard. And then God sent me Charlie and Keme. Praise God. Why would anyone do this? Why? Oh honey, I love you. I love you too, mom. It's okay. I'm just grateful that God brought me back to you. So am I. It's okay, don't try to move. Don't touch it, don't touch it, Just leave it… Ah, here comes the prodigal son. Look at you, moping around the house because of a woman, instead of sealing a simple family deal. You know, I don't even know how we'll face the disgrace of yesterday. We were at Otunba's last night, discussing the wedding plans and he was so angry that you couldn't even bother to... show up. It took all the skills I possess to pacify him and his daughter. How could you do that to us? It will be a wonder if Otunba speaks to me again. I don't know what got into him, what possessed him, he even went as far as telling Wande that... he is breaking up with her. Can you imagine? - What is that? - What is this? Look at it What's it? That is the woman that I love. The woman that I'm going to marry, right? Beaten up, kidnapped, tortured … Because of you? Did... - Did you ask them to beat her... - No! I didn't ask anybody to beat her. All I said was that they should keep her until... Mum!!! Until I could convince you that she had asked... you to leave her alone. I wouldn't ask anybody to beat her. - I didn't... - What's wrong with you people? Who does this? Dad, I'll send every single copy... - Wait, wait, wait. - Of these photos. Dad, dad, please, please, These pictures are going out, okay? Unless you do what I say. If you don't, let's see how your whole vice-presidential ambition, let's see how far that goes for you. You want to ruin me, me, your own father? Me, ruin you? Your own blood? Dad, you kidnapped someone! Look! Mum, dad, her parents have been worried for days, wondering where their daughter is. Not knowing whether she's alive or dead and I am supposed to be worried about your... re... reputation. Your career, that's what is important right now? What do you want us to do? How about we put this whole marriage charade to an end? Can we do that? I am not marrying Wande. I need you to apologize to Lola and her family. Mum, I'm being serious. Ok, and dad, the people who did this, I need them arrested. I will never apologize to anyone for looking after my family. Ok, let's see how you will enjoy... jail then. Hey, hey, hey, stop bluffing there. Ejike, now listen, let me tell you. No security organization in this country, I repeat, in this country, that will put, my wife and I in jail! Do you hear me? Alright, dad. Let's put that to the test. Shall we? Since you are the big man. Right? Maybe you're a big man here. But let's see what happens when they face pressure from the international media. Yes, because maybe you guys didn't know, but... Lola is a British citizen. So let's see what happens when the news gets a story about a British citizen being kidnapped, beaten and almost killed in Lagos. Let's see how that goes, Maybe that will be a story then. What? - Dele. - Ma. What happened to the girl I asked you to hold? Err... Uhhm... Mr... Ejike... came and saved her. Ehnehn, and I'm just hearing about it this morning? I... had no... credit, ma'am. And then I sent... Shut up your mouth! I pay you enough money to make sure there's enough credit on your phone How can I ask you to do something and you just disappointed me? I didn't... disappoint... you. I didn't, Ma. It's Mr. Ejikeme, ma It was Ejike who came... If you had done your job, he would not have found her. How did he know where to look? Ah, eh eh! Insider information, I'm sure. Oh, that's your excuse for not doing your job? Insider information. No, no, wait, wait, wait. Who beat her up? - Beat her? - Yes. Who beat her up? - Beat her? - Yes. I didn't beat her. It wasn't me. - You don't know? - No, sir. You were asked to watch and keep an eye on someone and you're telling me you don't know who? Do you know how serious the issue is? - I know, sir. I didn't beat her. - True! No sir. - Dele! - Ma. How often have I told you that you must always tell the truth? I'm speaking the truth. Ok, let me tell you exactly what happened. I had running stomach. Yes, Ma. My stomach was making noises. So I ran to the toilet and before I came back, the girl had vanished. It's... my stomach, ma'am. You know what? Deal with them, ask Kunle to handle this issue. I have to clean up all this before It gets to the press. - Please, sir - I'm off to see Otunba to tell him our own version of the story before he hears it from somebody - Do you hear me? - Good idea. Deal with them - No, as for you - It's... - you've lost your job. - It's running stomach... - No, ma, it's not me. - And you, I'm going to lock you up. I will lock you up. How could you have let that happen to that girl? I said, "Hold a girl," and you end up beating her until she is totally unrecognizable. Where is she? Where is the spineless coward who had thugs beat my daughter? - You? - Who is this woman? - Dele, get rid of her. - Ma? - Out! - If you touch me, I will tear you to pieces this morning. You dare hide behind your thugs? Face me! Face me like a woman! So I can show you what it is when cowards think they are above the law. Madam, leave my house before I get the police to lock you up for trespassing. The police? After what you did to my daughter? Lock me up? You dare touch me one more time, and I will show you why they say that Nneka Chukwuemeka is worth more than ten men. Your daughter had bitten off more than she can chew How dare you? - Aunty, let's go. - Rubbish I'm begging you. Ok guys take her inside. What kind of a mother are you? You would rather see your son unhappy because of your political goals? You don't know what you're talking about. Get out of my house! Take her inside. Stop! Take her inside! What kind of woman is this? I know I know, please, alright? Oh my God. Take her inside. Get out! Ah, get out! Are you deaf? She asked you to leave Ah, madam! Let me see. Congratulations. I hope you are at least happy with yourself. Uhmm, I... I can't even recognize the person seated in front of me right now, honestly. Ejike, please. Don't look at me like that, I am not a monster. I'm doing the best I can for my husband. Look, I didn't mean to hurt Lola. Things just got out of hand. Yes, but mum, but I kept telling you I kept telling you I did not want to marry Wande it wasn't complicated. Why wouldn't you just listen? Mum, I love you, okay? Always have, always will. But I can't have you interfering in my life like this. It's just not gonna work. I'm sorry. I won't interfere anymore. Forgive me? It's just one more thing. I actually need you to go and apologize to Lola and her family. Mum, not one of those manipulative apologies you give, when you don't want people to sue you. I need a genuine one, okay? For me, please. I need you to help me make this right. I need you to help me keep the woman that I actually love. Alright. Well, I'll apologize, I'll grovel, I'll cry to bring the smile back in your eyes. Are we good now? There's just... one more thing. God, what now? I need you to promise to rededicate your life to Jesus. Ejike, I don't know what you're talking about. My faith in God is just fine, I am very active in church. How did you come up with this ridiculous idea? Mum, come on. Let's be serious here. Not even you can lie to yourself that much. Surely, you know that you've fallen so far from Him. I mean, look at what your life has become. Look at the things you're doing with your time. Look at your face. Who is this person? What happened to that... prayer warrior? You know, the one that raised me… Mum, I became a Christian because of you, You were my role model. I wanted to be like you, I wanted to have that relationship with Christ the way you did. I wanted to serve, just because seeing you serve looked so… I wanted to be like you. How did you go from being that person to whoever this is? Son. Politics is a beast. You go in there with high hopes of changing things, of destroying the endemic corruption that has paralyzed our country. And before you know it You're making deals to get things on your agenda done. Very soon you realize that to survive you have to get rid of your ideals and jump into the swamp where it is always dirty And just like that. You become what you have always despised. You look at yourself in the mirror and you don't recognize what you see. But you console yourself that you have got things done And you just need a little bit more power to get some more things done. And then you'll go back to what you used to be, but you never go back. This is what we have become. This is our reality. This is who we are. Yes, but mum, it doesn't have to be. "It's not enough to just say: "Oh, this is what happened, and this is who I am now so that's it". Jesus will always take you back, always. His arms are just wide open, just waiting for us to come back to him. Mum look, it's possible. You just need to … You need to turn your back on all of these things, okay? On the world, on all of these power hungry things You've gotten yourself into. Just... Just give it up, okay? And come back to him and I promise you, He will accept you. Turn our backs, turn my back on everything we have attained? Go back to who we were? What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul. You taught me that. That's from you, mum. Alright, you can do this. I need you to believe that. You can do this. Mum, you've known Lola all her life, and you know, she's an amazing person. How could you say such horrible things about her? But it's the truth. She destroyed your relationship with Femi. Oh mum, spare me! Spare me! Femi went after her and she said "No" . If not for Lola, I would have married that miserable wretch. You should be thanking her and not using it against her. It's a pattern with Lola. She did the same to Bisola. Must she be the only one that men must die for? I'm only looking out for my cousin. Oh mum, stop, stop, stop. Your cousin is capable of looking out for herself. She doesn't need anybody to look out for her. Lola almost got killed. If not for Ejike and Charlie, Only God knows what would have happened to her. Wo, I don't have a hand in that o! Oh mum, you did! You encouraged her! You told her where and when to find Lola! You are an accomplice in this! You owe Lola and her family an apology! You owe them a big apology! Sisi Toyin! - Sisi Toyin! - Okay. Open the door! Don't tell me to stop! Sisi Toyin! Stop acting like a coward and face me! Face me! Don't tell me anything.
