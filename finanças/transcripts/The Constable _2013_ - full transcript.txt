Because you're afraid that if you die There'd be on one to care for your son? Now, you're not afraid of death? I requested for the transfer not because my fear of death People could die anytime 11 years ago, I knew that my son got Heart Disease & Down Syndrome I needed to be responsible with my family and my son Under the transportation team, I need to manage the team well As a policeman, I need to weed out the wicked and let the citizen live in peace I hope I can do my best in everyday, Sir You got involved 59 criminal cases in this 11 years assisted in catching 76 criminals Base on this record, Criminal Investigation shouldn't have no reason to reject you Okay, that's it for the interview Please wait for further notice, you can go Thank you Sir Chow Gong Hong, here's the last chance for you Not that, you can settle our debt You will also get some extra money Come with me to HK in 2 days We're gonna take money out at the bank Dah Kin, what am I gonna do?
