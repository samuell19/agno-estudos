This island is guarded by a sacred power. That destroys anything or any person who approaches it. Yet somehow the two of you have managed to survive. In my years here, I have attained a certain level of enlightenment. Which has allowed me to do things that are considered impossible by mere mortal men. I will teach you... this power. From this point on... you will be known as Chikara. It means... power and strength. Today on the beach, I saw a young man who will one day become a great warrior. You will be known as... Dekiru. To be able. I can sense that... deep within you... there is a willpower... that is capable of accomplishing any feat. You two will refer to me as... Master Mugendai. Get some rest, for tomorrow we begin training. Today you will have the chance to prove yourselves and your worthiness to me. I have placed a red cloth attached to a wooden pole, at the top of this mountain. We three will race to the top. - We? - As a race you? Ha! Are you kidding me? Sorry, I have to agree with Chikara. This seems a little unfair. Ah! Such a confidence. I hope that you do not lose. The looser will have double... the work for today. Begin! Did you two get lost? Wow! Old man you snuck up on us. I have being waiting for over an hour! - An hour? Are you kidding me or something? How could you've possibly have made it here before us? We left you way back there old man. Wait a second... what's going on here? This old man cheated and-- How dare you call me a cheater! I should scold you! What the-- - How did you-- - Sorry. What was that? I'm sorry... if your eyes cannot keep up. Enough of this! I have won the race. That means both of you, have to train harder today. However... since you beat Dekiru, I will offer you the red cloth... as your reward. What's this? Cool! I want one. That is an Infinity stone. It along with its two brothers. Holds the power to vanquish all of the evil of this world. And don't let it fall into the wrong hands. Now then... every morning, you two will run to the top of this mountain where I shall be waiting for you. And we'll begin with basic exercises. You'll be pushed beyond the limits of normal man. And every day... will only become more and more difficult as the last. I'm ready Master Mugendai! Yeah... me too. Good! For your warm up, I want each of you to do 1000 push-ups... on your knuckles. A thousand? I can't even do 100! Cool! I think I've seen one of these before. - Great. Now we're fighting like cavemen. You two must learn the basics. For that is where true power lies. Every movement must be necessary and efficient. Master, when do we get to learn to do crazy moves like... quadruple back-flip kicks? Forget all of the nonsense, that the outside world have tough you. Only here, you will learn the true form of martial arts. Now... Clear your mind... and we will begin. You should never allow yourselves to be caught in the center of your attackers. If you find yourselves surrounded by numerous opponents, like so... they have one target. Nothing stopping them from striking you. Good! Now Chikara cannot attack without injure to me Use this technique if you ever find yourselves surrounded by multiple opponents. Get up! You will work until you collapse. I've had enough of this. We've been at this for months. And I'm doubting there is any greater power! - This is bullsh-- - Enough Chikara! I will not stand for your insolence! Do you wanna see this power? Do you? Insolent kids! So does this means we're taking a break now? No it means we have to train even harder. It is time for another race my sons. This gem is very sacred to me. I would like to award the winner with it On the other side of the island, I have placed a blue cloth on a wooden pole. Whoever brings to me will be able to claim this as their reward. Begin! Cheerful challenging music] Hey Chikara... look what I've found. Don't worry though, I'll share the stone with you anyway. That gem is going to be mine! What is your problem? I'm the better student. I should be the one who gets the reward. Dekiru? No, no, no, no! No! Come back! Come back! Come back! Don't go... come back! Come back! It's clean, it's cheap energy. We've spent the last ten years perfecting the model for how's the energy extracted It's more efficient than anything that's ever been done before. Absolutely! You'll see your investment returns - within the first 18 months. - Easily, easily. Dad come quick! Looks like a young boy. Poor thing. Well looks like he's still alive... barely. Looks like he's been through a quite adventure. He's cute! Let's get him out of here. You're too slow. Come on I feel bad. It's like hitting Betty White or something. Bite me man! That's what you keep doing with all that fast food. It's making you soft and slow. Adds to this sexy body. What? Come on harder, faster. That's what she says-- Hey Ryan! Were you just working out? That's so hot. - Umm... Well I-- - And smelly too. Man I really need to take a shower you know, Wipe this down. Can't really reach my backside that much. But umm, any takers, uh? Ew! Hey Ryan! My parents are out of town, you should come over tonight. Umm... well I don't know if I can. I have a lot to do. Dude I cannot believe you turned down a for sure thing man. They were totally into us. But then again, who wouldn't be into this one hmm? Or his twin brother? Kleben! Do you like being a tool? I'm not a tool alright. I'm just pure sexiness. Too much for... most women to handle. Yeah? Well here comes Madison. You better put away that sexiness, before you scare her away. Do not offense man, but your sister's freaking hot! Thanks man, like I don't hear that enough. You know, technically you guys aren't related right, So you could like... Ew! No way man! Oh! Yeah! Thanks for the massage oil and candles. They'll come in handy-- Oh Madison! Planning on a night alone in your room I see. Hey Ryan! You know me too well. I'm starving! Easy tiger. - What's up bro? - In here dude. Oh man what's up-- Oh hey Madison! Woo, I'm really digging that new look. I love how he just comes as he pleases. Yeah boy! Who would have thought Richie Rich would grow up to be a pimp! Using the money from a grand offered to him by the McFall family, Mr. Sifer Desrosier left his fellow business partner, Patrick Keelan. And started his new company called Darwin Corp. After successfully discover a new cheap energy resource to replace oil. Mr. Desrosier has decided to open a new power plant south of the metro area. Laura Peters is now on the scene with Mr. Desrosier, for more on this story. Excuse me Mr. Desrosier can I have a minute of your time please? How do you explain your power plant emitting ten times the emissions that it did from last year? Probably due to it producing ten times the power. Resulting in ten times the profits for shareholders. Is it true about your company? Is the Darwin Corporation planning to build another plant? Yes, obviously. Currently this baby is already pumping out everything we can get from her. On a State Park? I bought it fair and square. Consider a jump start for the real estate market. The people can erect another park in my honor, after I saved this country from its economic turmoil. I wanna understand, why we had to come in so late. It's Friday night for crying out loud. My dear sis... we didn't have to. This was just stupid coming here. I had to talk to that ugly poor reporter. Please Adalina, spare me the details. Whatever! Ugh! It's so boring here! I wanna go dancing! We can go to Pops. Give it that to me. I'm warning you. It's mine now dear brother. I promise I'll get one of your own. - A bigger one. - Shinier? Whatever your little heart desires. Great! Can we go dancing now? Yes we can go dancing. Oh goodie! Yeah! So what's the situation in here, uh? Oh hey, there's Madison. I'm gonna go chill with her. So, try not to get into any troubles. Yeah... With the girls. Ryan hey! Come over here, play with us. What you guys playing? Pong. Have you ever played before? No, actually. Man it's pretty simple. Just take this pong ball and you throw it in those cups across the table. Sounds easy enough. Ooh! Yeah! Don't make us wait forever! Oh beat you this time. Yeah, you sure did. You just got this skills. - That'll get you far in life. - You jerk! So where is Kyle? Did you lose him already? Umm... probably staking his next pray. We should probably go look after him before he gets himself into trouble. Hey Ryan, glad you showed! Come with me. Come on, dance with me a little bit. - Actually I was just a... - Hey! We got to go, so if you don't mind-- Don't touch him, I saw him first! Hey! How's it going? You're like the state of Georgia, cause you're always on my mind. That's really funny... you should tell that to my boyfriend. What did you say about my girlfriend? I said you're a saint and a scholar and she's a princess. Let's go outside. Oh God! Hey come on! I was messing around you know? You got my shirt dirty. Yeah, your shirt's not the only thing that is about to get dirty. Kick his ass Steve! I'd hardly say it's a fair fight. You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. That's kind of gross man. I don't know what kind of guy you think I am, but... I guess I'm gonna have to get checked after this. Just get him man! Wait, wait, wait! Here hold this really quick. Oh! Hey come on guys, let him go. You want a piece of this princess uh? Freak! Cops! Come on, this way. Kyle! Get out of here, come on! Wow, What a night! Man, I totally kick those guy's butts. You know what I'm saying, uh? Right Ryan? Hmm? What's up with the serious face man? Did you see the way hey looked at me? I mean, they called me a freak, man. I obviously don't belong here... in this place Yeah... It's kind of smelly isn't it? No, I mean... you've seen what I can do. I need to figure out... why and how I'm able to do things that normal people can't. How do you mean by that? I feel like I'm just waiting for something you know? Like I was meant for more. You, you see what I mean guys? You're not the only one who feels that way, you know. I need to figure out who I am and where I come from. I may not know where you come from, but I do know you. You're a good guy and a great friend. You've made living here tolerable. Do you really think that you're the only who feels that's about to go insane around here? Yeah man... forget about those high school jerks, baby. We're college bound! They're just jealous and insecure, for real! Thanks Dr. Phil. Whatever alright. At least I won the fight didn't I? Didn't we? So uh, when did you learn the... drunken master technique? Don't you mean actually drunk technique? Whatever guys alright, I won that fight. I got the job done, ok? We'd better get going. We have to be downtown for our college orientation in a few hours. What do you think it's like out there? What? Out where? The world... out there you know? Do you really think it is as bad as Master Mugendai says it is? Master who? I hope all of this training pays off for something big in the end. One day, I'm gonna save the world from all the darkness. Dekiru? Ryan? Ryan! Yeah, what's up? I'm up. Mom and dad gave me their credit card so we can stay in the city after we visit colleges. Alright sweet, I'll let Kyle know. - Know what dude? - Oh! What do you live here now? You got like five guest bedrooms. Plus... you'd miss me if I wasn't here. Oh you two were made for each other. Dude seriously, start packing right now because we have to go downtown tonight! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Wooo hooo! Ok we are here, I... think this's where she want us to meet her. Daddy? Why did you and mommy decide not to be together anymore? Well it's difficult to explain, you see... when you get older you realize that, life sometimes doesn't go the way you planned. And well, your mother... she just doesn't know what she wants right now. - Is it something that I did? - No, no! Baby it's nothing you've done. As a matter of fact... She's going to be here in any minute now, excited to see you and play with you all weekend long. There's my little girl! - Mommy! You're ready to have fun with me this weekend? Yeah! I can't wait! What did your daddy do to your hair? I tried... Nox. Kristine. Well umm, how have you been? I have been good, and you? Good. Well you know, same old, same old. Oh mommy! Can we get ice cream on the way home? Of course we can get anything you want. Well, I guess I'll see around, uh... maybe we can get some coffee sometime? Yeah! I like that. Ok... take care of my baby. I'll see you guys on Sunday. - Ok. - Alright. Alright, alright. Gather around and be quiet all you beautiful young people. I'm gonna drop some knowledge on ya'll about this school. You see, State was founded in 1913. Check out all these hot señoritas man. They're everywhere! Yeah I see them. They're gorgeous. What's up bros? - What's up! - How's campus so far? It's pretty nice. But we literally just got here, and-- And what my friend is trying to say is... where do all the hot chicks hang out at night? Party's going to be at the Tavern tonight. You should totally come check it out. There's gonna be a ton of hot babes there! Man, I like you already dude! I'm gonna be there, right Ryan... Me and Kyle were invited to a party, you down? Well I guess. I'm going to my first college party ever with my two favorite people. This's gonna be epic! What's up you cute thing? Do you want to go to a college party? At the Tavern down the street? We're going to the Tavern... How do you know about it? Oh, it's kind of a local spot for most of us here. Well cool. My name is Kyle. This is Ryan. And this is uh, the apple of my eye, Madison. Jessica, and that sounds fun. What are you guys doing before then? Uh, We were actually going to go sightseeing. You know, having a tour around town. Well, um I have lived here for a few years now, I could show you guys around if you want. That would be awesome. Let's do it. Great! I use to come here when I was a kid. You came here as a kid? Cause I would come here every single day. This is pretty neat, right Ryan? I'm friends with morons. I'm gonna try on some costumes. Coming darling. Oh no you don't mister. You're coming too. Hey Nox... how are you? I mean... How are things lately? Listen I know we've had some differences in the past. I don't know. I just think maybe we... I mean... I mean I might have acted a little too harshly towards you. Man you can say that again. I really didn't... I don't want things to be how they are. I guess what I'm trying to say is that... I'm, I'm so... hold on, Gabby wants to talk to you. Hey daddy! I miss you, and I can't wait to see you! When are you and mommy and I going to be together again? That's enough Gabby, we got to go! Tell daddy you love him. Ok. Love you daddy. Bye, bye! Dude I cannot wait man. Tonight's our first college party. This is pivotal in our social well-being you know. It's pretty much spring training for next year. Yeah I guess. I just want to chill and meet some people. Yeah, by new people you mean some incredibly hot, hottie, hotties right? Get your spear and shield man we're going hunting alright! Are you guys ready yet? Mmm, trying to get a quick peek at this well sculpted, well maintained body I see, hmm? Kyle, I would rather watch the Queen of England get a sponge bath than to see you in anything more revealing than a turtleneck. Right. Come on dude, are you ready yet? Yeah, hold on a second. What do you guys think about this shirt huh? Great! Amazing! Seriously, let's go! Hold on, one more thing that apparently statistically gets all the ladies. Mmm... mmm... So let's uh, let's raise the stakes on this next shot, shall we? Um you miss it, I get to wine and dine you tonight. And if I make it? Like that's gonna happen. All I'm thinking about is the b-e-a-u-tiful children we're going to make. Crap! Sorry honey, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. So that's when my dad changed jobs and I moved here from Iowa. That's got to be a tough move. What does you dad do now? Well he had a hard time looking for work. But he does some kind of contracting with the Darwin corporation. So he's like a very important guy or something? I guess, he barely even has time for me anymore. Always traveling all the time. I hate it and I hate that company. How so? Well I do some journalism and I discovered that the temperature of this city is actually two degrees warmer because of the pollution caused by that building. Yeah, I don't really watch the news very much. But umm... don't they like specialize in providing technology powered by some new form of energy or something? Yes, but they keep it pretty secret as to where they harvest this new resource. Whatever it is that they are doing, it's killing the planet one way or another. Sounds like you really hate this company. Hey! Don't make fun of me, I'm serious. She has a point. I used to work for that company. Drilling department. Use to? Yeah! They fired me for asking too many questions. Was hard on the whole family. What kind of questions were you asking? Well... it seemed like-- Nah, never mind. Hey Ryan umm... can I borrow 20 bucks dude? I owe Madison some money. Really Kyle? Again? I'm sorry man, she's a freaking pool shark. Bartender! Can you turn the TV up? This just in. A building has caught fire in the Midtown area just a few moments ago Officials on the scene are now evacuating the occupants in the area. The cause is apparently unknown. Residents in the area have reported a loud explosion, referencing to what maybe a gas leak. We are now being told that the building adjacent to it has now caught fire. More reports are coming in, but for now all we have is speculation. We'll have more on this story as it develops. - Do you see anything? - What was that? Over there! The whole building is collapsing! My wife and daughter are over there. Kyle, take Jessica and Madison out of town. I got to help that guy! Are you kidding me? You're going to get yourself killed! Look I really need to do this right now, I can't explain it, but I have a feeling deep down that I need to do this! Ok. Come on Kyle let's go, he'll be alright. I'll meet you guys back at home! I promise I'll be alright. Hey mister, I'm coming with you. Just fine by me, just don't get yourself killed and most importantly, don't get me killed. By the way, my name's Nox. Nox Alvarez. Ryan, Ryan McFall. Ok Ryan. My daughter, Gabby, is over at my wife's apartment over on 14th street. As long as you're with me, I'm in charge. So do what I say and stay close! Alright. Kristine, open up! Nox? What the hell are you doing here? Have you been watching the news? Gabby won't stop crying and... and I'm losing my mind! - I knew I should of listened to Shakesha-- - I know! I know baby. I came here to get you and Gabby out of the city. Alright. Let me pack some stuff up. Pack some stuff? Girl we need to get out of here now! - Where's Gabby at? - Daddy I'm scared! I know, I know baby look... we're gonna go on a little trip right now ok? I'm need you to be a big girl, Ok? For daddy, ok? Alright, let's go. What about your wife? Where is that damn woman? - No, no, no, I got to get my keys! - There's no time! You trying to die girl? Psst. Shh, can you see them? Yes, there's only three of them. - Are they able to see us? - No. Hey creeps over here! Thanks! Deal with him. Yeah, that's what's up! Come on, you wanna a piece of me? Bring it on guys! Oh, on... on second thought, I... I see you guys are busy with the city. Well, I'll just leave you guys along. Look, what's that? What do you want? Don't worry, I'll handle them. Just head that way, my friend went to go grab a car nearby. Thanks guy! It's Ryan by the way! You guys don't give up, do you? Nox better be ready with that car! Damn! Miss me? Daddy, what's that? Damn! Nox? Nox we got to get out of here. What is that? Do you hear me? Nox, we got to go! Gabby! Baby, wait come back! Don't let it get me! Gaby, baby, get back here. We have to keep going! Kristine! Kristine! Kristine! No, no! Come on, let's get you out of here! Nox... Please... take care of Gabby for me. Please! No... Don't leave me Kristine. Kristine. Don't leave me. Kristine! We should go see my brother, I'm sure he'll give us a ride on his airship. You're Adalina? Sifer Desrosier's sister? Sifer? As in the one who owns the Darwin Corporation? That damn! I bet you he's the one behind all of this. He's gonna get it when I see him! Do you really think he's behind all this? Tell him Ryan, you saw! Look, it... the point is... we need a way out of the city and Adalina has a way of transportation. Listen... I know that you lost someone very important in your life. But your daughter needs you. We need to continue. Alright, let's go. Told you it was a mistake letting Ryan go. - For all we know he could be de... - Don't even say it Kyle! Wait do you guys hear that? Ryan! You're alive! - I was so worried! - Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just glad to see that you are all safe as well! Oh man, I thought that you were a goner, especially after what hey said on the news. - It's good to see you. - You don't even know the half of it! - When we were going through the-- - I hate to be a bother, but time is of the essence. Now, please sit down if you don't mind. For those that do not know, my name is Sifer Desrosier. You are Sifer? From the Darwin corporation? That is correct sir. For years I have used my company to produce the latest and most innovative technologies. However, I feel I have somewhat misused my resources. You're damned right! You're the cause of all this! My dear friend, I've nothing to do with what's going on here, I can assure you of that. However, I do have a few ideas. There's an old legend that says long ago a man unlocked the very mysteries of the universe and gained access to unlimited power. However, after discovering the evil within the hearts of men and fearing what they might do with such power, he disappeared... never to be heard from again. So are you saying that he is the one destroying the city? That is a possibility. I have done some research and discovered a similar legend in the Middle East, that says this man, of unlimited power, created three stones. Each with some sort of magical energy that if combined, would give their possessor enough power to destroy all evil in the world. I guess he made them as an insurance policy... incase his own heart were ever to become filled with darkness. So why would he come here? Why now? It's a good question. I believe that he is in search of these gems in order to destroy them. So that no one will ever be his equal. This man has no equal. I don't even think he's human! I will admit... that the reason he has come to our beloved city was in search of this. Yeah, I think a lot of men would come in search of that girl right there. What's up! How are you doing? I'm Kyle. Sorry, my friend has a condition. So you are to blame for this? Was I the one that terrorized thousands? Did I personally destroy half of the city? No. I was simply on an excavation that lead me to find this rare specimen. The gem allowed me to harvest its energy to create everything you see around you. I could not have known, that a strange shadow army would appear and terrorize the city years later. Maybe not directly, but you're still poisoning the planet with the pollution that thing causes. Please child, let's not dwell on the past. We need to act on the present if we're ever going to put an end to this. He's right we need to come up with a plan! Luckily I have already set forth an idea. My men have been working around the clock and discovered the location of another gem. Do you remember an old Spanish conquistador named Cortez? Well you might have learned that Hernan Cortez was a man who went on an expedition that lead to the fall of the Aztec Empire. During his excavations he discovered one of these gems. Not knowing it's true power, it slowly ate away at his mind until the power consumed him. He had the ability to conquer entire civilizations without any consequence. Unfortunately, when he died, the stone's location died with him. So you've found it? Yes... off of an island in South America. Well what the hell are we waiting for? Let's go! Way ahead of you my dear boy, the coordinates are already set. Feel free to make yourselves at home, we have an early day tomorrow. Did you see me Master? Did you see what I can do? Good my son, that's splendid. You are progressing well. What's wrong Master? It's nothing, just... leave me. Who are they? Once long ago I was a very happy man. As I lived in peace with my wife... Mitsu. She's beautiful! Yes. Yes she was lovely. This over here is... this over here was my son... Yoshi. What happened to them? They were taken by the evil in men's hearts. Two thieves tried to rob us walking home one evening. Mitsu's voice, Mitsu's scream startled the thieves causing them to fire their weapons on me and... my family. I was spared being... only wounded. But... they killed my... my family. Ryan. There you are, I was getting worried. How long was I out for? All night, you must've been pretty tired from the city huh? Um uh... Yeah, actually I've been meaning to talk to you about that. Hold on, one second. What do you want? Ok yeah we'll see you in a minute. You were saying? Nothing. I'll tell you later. Who was that? That was Kyle, he wants to meet up and talk about everything. Oh, actually that sounds like an excellent idea. Hey buddy, how are you feeling? Shhh, are you trying to wake everyone up on the damn ship? - I'm sorry! - Shh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So what do you guys think of everything that's going on? Pretty unreal huh? Yeah, I'm still trying to process everything. What I wanna know is what happened in the city. Um well there was a man... in a red cloak. Like from your dream? Go ahead and tell them Ryan, it's ok. Well ever since I can remember, I've been having these recurring dreams. Of what? Well it's not much really, but I know I'm on an island and there is a young boy who lives there, Well I think he lives there. And umm... He, he had a, he wears a red rag around his arm and has special abilities like the man in the city. So what does that have to do with what's going on? Well that's just it, I'm not really sure, but what I do know is that I have like some sort of connection with this boy. And yesterday, when I went into the city, I had the same connection with the man in the red cloak. There has to be a reason for it, it must mean something. I'll tell you guys what it means. It doesn't mean a damn thing. You guys talking about... dreams, and fantasies of men dancing in red capes. I thought I was the crazy one. But... you saw what happened in the city. I could have seen anything in the city! Give me a break, you can't deny what happened. I'm not denying anything you little-- - Guys! Take it easy! She's right, we're not going to get anywhere like this. Let's just say that Ryan's dreams are linked to what's going on right now. How does that help us? It doesn't! Unfortunately, he's right. I know is that someone has attacked the city. We have to assume that they are after these stones, and that they, they're actually not alone. Not alone? Yeah there was like some shadow... warriors, or ninjas, or... something! Ninjas, really? I'm gonna die. Regardless, I want everybody else to take extra care. We have no idea what we're going to find tomorrow. What a splendid morning! The air is so fresh here. And the view is... so nice! What's up man, look at that outfit! Yeah! - Yeah you're not looking too bad yourself man! - Thanks dude! Here, take this. We're going to split up in to two groups of three. I'm going to have some quality time with the ladies. Shoot! Don't worry little man. You get to hang out with me. Good. What're you getting into later on? Ok, we'll see you guys later. Just remember to call if you find anything. You know, Sifer... you're kind of a bad ass man. I'm serious. This guy is like the richest person we know, he's got like an airship in space, and you have two swords on your back. Pretty cool! I think someone has a little crush. I'm just saying... I bet you get with a lot of women, right? Wow! Dude... Looks kind of old, uh. Do you think it has any importance? Looks like junk to me. But maybe I'm wrong. By junk you mean sweet buried treasure, worth a fortune! So you were found floating in the middle of the ocean? Yeah and I have no idea how I got there either. Yeah. So, my father adopted him and we've been best friends ever since. You mean, brother and sister. Yes, Jessica, that's what I meant. Hey guys, I think I found something. Madison can you call Sifer and tell him that we've found something? On it! What do you think used to be here? I'm not sure. But I bet Sifer will know. Ok, well... besides Kyle finding some stick with markings I told them where we are and they should be here in an hour or so. Well let's check it out! We're not really going in there are we? That's fine Jessica, you just wait out here and we'll be right back. Hey! Wait for me! That was the other group. They said they've found something. We should probably head over there. Sounds awesome. So um... where did you learn martial arts anyway? Well... I use to be a student trained by my old master in the Middle East. But he turned out to be some crazy old fool. What do you mean? He's the one who started telling me these legends and ever since then he had me convinced that there's some great power out there that mere men could one day obtain. What kind of power? What's it matter? The old man was a couk. But the one thing that I still find hard to believe even to this day. Is the story of the three stones. Oh, like the one on your pocket? Very observant you are. Yeah, there's some way to trigger or harness... the power in them. Up until now, I've only been able to extract the energy using machines. How did I get mixed up in all of this stuff? So the monster in the news, that was somehow summoned from these stones? I suppose so. The legends don't explain exactly what the stones are capable of. Just that when all three are combined, they will possess a power to destroy any evil. Word. Hey! Look over there? I don't think we're here alone. You two stay close, we don't want anyone get lost. Do you think anything lives down here? I hope not. Wait, what's that? Just relax... it's not going anywhere. Well there are three! - Wait! Don't take another step. - What is it? - Help me look. - What are we looking for? I think I've found something. Ok, let's go! Umm, wait... I don't think those skeletons are there for decoration. Madison, can you get a hold of Kyle - and ask where they are? - Sure. Kyle, Kyle come in, are you there? Over. Hey darling. How're you doing? Do you miss me already? Listen we're in a bit of a predicament. Ryan has a question for you. Hey Kyle, buddy. Sifer said you found a stick earlier when you were walking through the forest, correct? You mean my new stick? Yeah it's pretty handy. What's up man? - Good! He also said that there was uh weird carvings on it, right? Yeah, they're pretty hilarious. There is one with a sleeping bird that might be drunk, or... sleeping or something. I don't know, it's pretty funny. - I need a favor from you. - Give me a ring-a-ding. When Madison asks, Uh, call out the decorations of each carving, one by one, and in order. Got it? So each time Madison asks, read one off the stick, got it. Ok Madison, ask away. Ok Kyle, what does the first picture looks like. Like I said. The first picture is of a bird sleeping. Here goes nothing. Ok, What does the second symbol looks like? It's some kind of symbol, but there's a circle around it. Yep! And the third one? Yeah, it's a monkey of some sort. Keep going. The next is that same symbol with a circle around it. Alright. Then, there is a picture of three fish? Yeah! Ok, then we got that same symbol with the circle again. Yeah. - Then There is a... - A what? I can't really tell, it's a... snake maybe? Ok, Kyle I need you to be a little more specific. Can you tell me what the snakes are doing? They're wrapped around a branch with their tongues sticking out. Ok, so there're multiple snakes. Yes, there are two that I can see. - Ok. And then, the circle again, right? - Correct. Oh whoa whoa no wait, wait! Ryan! What the hell man! So the next symbol is a spider. Thanks Kyle, but we're good now, thanks! Ok, Well. If you need anything else just-- Do you think it's safe to cross now? Um yeah... but maybe you should go slow just in case. It's ok, you made it. Come on guys, it's not over yet. Well if this is the end, where's the stone? Hmm... that is a good question. There must be more to it. Let's take a look around. Look, over there. It's just a mirror. Wait... there's something off about that mirror. I can't quite put my finger on it. Hey guys look at this. This statue. What about it? Now look at it in the mirror. How odd! Do you think we should try fixing it? It's worth a shot. So you put it back together. There it is, but how do we get to it? It's not even a mirror anymore! What just happened? I don't have the slightest idea. OK, we got it, now let's get out of here. That was amazing. - Ryan what are you... doing? - Shh! Be quiet for a second. Is that you Dekiru? Who are you? Is that you Dekiru? It is you! It has to be! Only one person alive could attack one of my shadow warriors and live to tell about it! Where have you been all of this time? Listen buddy I don't know who you're talking about. But those were innocent people you killed. Yes blah blah, innocent people... their weak, insignificant lives were given to a greater cause. And besides it's not like they were all innocent. Yeah, but that doesn't mean they deserved to die! Don't you remember the island where we trained for so long? The island? Is that you in my dreams? I told you... that I would save this world and everyone in it and that is exactly what I'm doing. How can you say that? Save them... save them from what? I have learned to harness this darkness that controls your so called world. And I am using it to start anew. Everything will be as how I see fit. We will have a perfect utopia! Join me, Dekiru, and together we will rule this world - and everyone in it! - You're wrong! Sure, there are bad people on the planet, but there are also good ones, people with heart... hopes, families, and dreams. The planet isn't perfect man, but what the hell is? I ... No, I won't, I, I can't come with you. Silence! I will not waste time messing words with this moron! You're not Dekiru, you couldn't possibly be! Look at how soft you've gotten, living with these pathetic humans has made you weak! I'll show you who's pathetic! Ryan let's get out of here. Who's pathetic? Now we will truly see if you are Dekiru. - Oh not this mother-- - What's going on? Shh, shh, shh. Let her go! Oh now you've done it. Ryan, take these! Just as I said, pathetic! It's good to see that I am still the better student. You can't beat me. Don't even try! Oh I'm sorry, did I hurt your feelings? If only Master could see you now. That's enough! You're fast, but can you dodge these? Try me. Stop right there! I wouldn't do that if I were you! Let her go! What? Let her go! I don't believe it! I said, Let her... Go! Ryan! Ryan, that was amazing! How did you even do that? - Are you okay? - Did I... did I get him? Yeah! He's gone. - Ok good! - You were really amazing. Oh look what I found! Woo hoo! Looks like we got what we came for. I'm exhausted let's go eat! Hello there. Look who's alive and kicking. You're not gonna believe what happened. Yes, well you're not going to believe this. Whoa, whoa, hey... what's this? I have decided to keep the gem for myself. And if that means killing you all in the process, well then so be it. - You no good lying son of a-- - Kyle, give it to him. It's not even worth it. It's beautiful. Alright, we leave! Wait! My daughter is still there! Let's consider this collateral. Don't worry she'll be safe. You animal! Are we just going to let him get away? I swear I'll hunt you down and kill you for this! Wait, where's Ryan? Adalina? Check out what I have! It's even more beautiful than the first! I believe a celebration is in order. Tell the pilot to chart a new course. We're East bound! Is something wrong? Sorry for interrupting, but your brother and I need to have a little chat.
