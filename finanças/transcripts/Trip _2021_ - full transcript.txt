Vasanth! Vasanth! Vasanth! In the year 1937... this world encountered with a massive natural disaster During which India and territories around it were hugely affected One among them was the South Sentinel island The British government that was ruling India back then Realizing that the lives of the tribes there must be in danger... they sent the army with the intention to rescue them Few of the tribal, who were struggling for their lives... thought the army was there to finish of them and their race, when they saw them The started attacking them but... the soldiers risked their life, rescued and took the tribal back to their home But a few of them alone escaped and hid inside a cave in that forest The series of natural disasters finally came to an end The tribal, who were hiding inside the cave, stepped out Witnessing the destruction caused to their forest by the storm... they shed tears wondering how are they going to survive there These tribal whose staple food was meat... went into starvation and one by one they started fainting As days passed by... they started believing that they can survive only if they turn into cannibals As as result of the belief first, one man killed another one Though other were driven furious by his act... they too joined him and started to eat the meat of the dead As this went on and they killed each one of them one by one... until the last man stood alive! After one point when he thought he can't survive without meat... he started eating his own flesh Poison spread across all over his body with all his flesh torn... as his blood started clotting and he wandered in the forest losing his energy... he fell in front of a plant And that was a wild plant called Dionaea muscipula, which fed on meat! As that plant hunted his flesh and started feeding on it... the last person of that race died a gory death!

And in six months I'll turn her into a mother I will make that child call you uncle! If this doesn't happen... then I am not Azhagan! Azhaga... Your name might mean "beauty"... but doesn't mean you can wish for anything out of your league! You're just a carpenter -And you? -I'm a painter! This house will be mine... and so the girl! She can instead commit suicide! Get lost! I'll inform you once I marry her... you may come and lay pipes in our bathroom! Shut up! Amudha... see this? All these are vintage items Even the frames aren't dusted! Will Vani Rani serial play in this? Call Vani and Rani, they might come here and play but not the serial "Where are you?" Amudha! Azhaga? Saw this last when I sat down with A R Rahman for composing Old memories! You mean the carpenter job you went to do there? Amudha...

But damn, the fish isn't taking the bait! Azhaga! -She is up! -So soon? Paapi! Paapi? It's a pet name. Now, shut up! Why is she sitting down? Of course! She's showing me respect! That's why she sat down! What is it, Paapi? Please don't harm me! Please! -Please don't harm me? -What do you think we'll do? Please don't! You got hurt and we rescued you! Do we look like...

"Oh my God, I'm drowning in happiness" There is he goes! Buddy! Over there... Lidi... Lidi... You said out strength was that we're together! The moment one of us got isolated... they smartly kidnapped her We underestimated them They are nothing like what we thought Thought they'd come in search of us but now? They are making us search for them! On top of that they left a clue that Lidi is with them I feel Lidi must be in this same forest What are you thinking, Vikram? Paapi... "Come to my home and you'll start liking me" "Get down and you'll like everything around" Come on Do you like the house? What are you looking at? Get in! Whose house is this? My mother-in-law's house What? What what? If she's yours then Andrea in the photo inside is mine!

She screamed looking at that toy dog That's a toy! You go and move it somewhere You come Come on now She got scared looking at a toy? Girls get scared of toy dogs but let real dogs sleep in their bed And husband will sleep in the couch That's their culture! Sit down! Don't be shy. Sit down -So Paapi, what would you like to eat? -What would you like to eat? She is getting scared of your and the dog's face since both look same Go, make tea for your sister Go! This is too much!

So, what do you guys do? Us? See that Anglo Indian grandma in the photo behind? Her son was a forest officer working for the government The government gave him permission to build a house in middle of this forest Look at his fate... as soon as he built this house, they made him retire Devastated he settled down in foreign along with his family Looks like he's coming down with his family next week. So, we were sent here... I am a reputed... carpenter And your brother here... He's my asistant, just a painter Due to storm, the tree fell down in the backyard Use the chainsaw and saw it Trying to score? Else it's tough to survive in this industry You have it Wanna watch TV? There, watch it That's how even we are watching it. Just empty screen! Looks like someone came to set up cable connection... but looks like Cheetah got him!

Is he going to sing? -You carry on! -You too carry on singing Good boy! Will do a neat job Paapi, I practice singing at early morning in the pond He thinks he is singer Yesudas!

Fine, poor music director Vijay Antony Let me sing the next song Okay? Third song... I shall sing a song that will be a sentiment between us To hell with you! Buddy, that's their gypsy over there I think they must have held Lidi captive inside this house We don't know how many of them are there inside Before we all go inside, one must go and find out what's going on there Why don't you go? Buddy.., I shall go -Be careful -Shut up! He knows! Go! Just go! Run! Run! "Who would I blame for this sin?" "Oh my Love..." Rascal! This ain't a coffee shop to listen to music and sleep! Kill me if you want but stop singing I'll go and sleep. I'm very tired Fine, go! This is exactly how I left while composing with A R Rahman Hence my current plight! I want and must sing the last song that I composed with him "Oh my shining moon..." Why is Amudhan bathed in mud? -Azhaga! -Amudha! What happened? Amudhan! I am asking you! What happened? Did he go mad listening to his song? Why is she laughing like that? Are you guys trying to piss me off? Azhaga, a word! Come out Come out! Paapi, keep quiet Why are you bathed in mud? Look here... I smell some serious issue Her friends came here They took off when they saw me -What are you saying? -Yes! And here you are singing holy songs to her Not holy songs but A R Rahman's songs I can't control! Look, the way Paapi laughs is so beautiful She already got her doubts about us All I'm saying is that if we tell her this, she'll leave in search of her friends First, go clean this crap and then we'll talk Listen to me! Go! Go! -Azhaga... -Listen to me! Go! Use paper to clean if there is no water What happened to him?

Both of them are here Paapi, can you please tie my shoe lace? They are digging a hole to bury someone What if... they'd have already murdered Lidi? Look, it's Lidi who is digging the hole! What if... they are making her dig the hole to bury her later? Azhaga... next? Next? Let's go and mop the house!

Where are you taking that window? -Oh here? -Fix it here Take your hands off Azhaga, nail carefully You go and have a smoke The axe fell off his forehead Shall I hang it around my neck? Azhaga... take care of Lidi until I'm back They might come back and anything can happen I shall go and dispose the corpse I have kept a shovel for safer purpose Forget shovel, don't you go inside until I come -Why? -Wait outside! -Amudha! -Azhaga! I know you very well Go! Now, go! You go first! Do you hear the sound? Yes Go! Come on! Why are you beating me? I ain't worth all that! He's acting smart! Let me break his jaws! When did I act smart? We must not kill him so easily We need him! His scream must bring his friend here! Just call him and he'll come Only then we can get in and save Lidi You want him to scream, right? It's a walk in the park! Vikram, what is he doing? Guess what tree is this? What are you up to? I've placed an atom bomb in a sensitive area! Just watch him scream now! Sound! Is he loud enough? What did you do? While running from there, I had to take a dump I just used this single wild leaf I have put three leaves inside his pants Is it burning? Turn away! Amudhan said he'll be back soon after disposing the corpse Why isn't he home yet? Amudha! You friend, Ila is waiting here. Come soon! Azhaga... why are you sitting all by yourself here? Why are your friends troubling us? There is a huge misunderstanding My friends have mistaken you both... and in the attempt to save me from you guys... things are somehow going awry! Everything will be solved if I talk to them Wonder where they came from? They are torturing us everyday! So, where's Amudhan? Your friends' corpse are a threat to us if we leave it here So, I handed him a shovel and asked him to bury them in the forest He might be on his way back God! Are you nuts? -Why? -Why did you send him? What if my friends see him and harm him? What do we do then? Look here... if your friends cause any harm to my friend Amudhan... I'll butcher your friends... and set them ablaze to beat the cold! Got it? What are you gonna do now? I'm going to get Amudhan In this forest? At this hour? Where will you look for him? Wait, I'll come Paapi... you have only seen the soft side of this Azhagan... but you have not seen my rough side, have you? Watch me now! I'll be back with Amudhan There's Semolina inside. Go and prepare Upma! What? Get inside! Go! Whatever! There's onions in the third pot. Use them Close the door! Amudha! Amudha!

It's a monkey Get lost you pig face! Even the monkeys know me very well! Amudha! Amudha! Azhaga, save me! What are you looking for? Checking if I'm in the right place? God! Amudha! Amudha, what are you doing here? First, take it out! Rascal! I came to save you and you wanna talk dirty? You doofus! Untie me! Wait They've tied you with a soft creeper! You could have broke it easily! God! Ouch! Amudha! Why are you humping the tree? Only I know how it burns! If it burns then pour water on it! Correct! Amudha! Already we are exhausted trying to save you from them Our friends... David and Rizwan are dead! I know Vikram! They are no killers like you imagine! They are innocents Enough bathing like a hippopotamus! -Come on now -It feels so good! It feels good? Paapi is alone at home. Come on, now What? Paapi is alone at home? Yes!

It must be ready Let's parcel it and head out some place nice for dinner Now, drive You ate? Amudha, when have I ever had food without you? Now, drive! You won't listen to me and wanna support those two fellows? Vikram! Why are you pleading to her? Looks like they are more important to her than us! Come, let's leave! She'll learn her lesson when she dies here! Jeni... I understand he is upset and can't understand me But not you! Azhaga... do me a favour Please stop singing Why? It's a nice song! Can't you watch your step? Are you drunk? Why is everyone fainting right in front of us? Turn her around It's a girl!

Told you we'll drag unnecessary trouble! Here it is Move! Rambo, hop you are also their friend. There's a seat behind. Come and sit Why are you talking to the dog?

Your friends would come for you. Did you serve him Upma? Hope you guys ate but why did you leave the tiffen carrier at the entrance? You didn't listen to me, right? See that? They have murdered someone else and brought her corpse! -You call them innocents? -Corpse? -Azhaga... -Amudha, what does he mean? What did you guys do now? -Who is this? -What do you mean?

Who was that? I don't know you guys and why you all are here But... you people are going to die! My astrologer, Shankar Narayanan said I'd live till age of 87! Don't you try to fool me! You fool! The gas cylinder is leaking! What? Will be believe only if Shankar Narayanan tells you? Yes! Let's run! Run! Move! Come on, run! Paapi, run! Run! Uh-oh! The hero has flung the gas cylinder! Who are you? Did the gas cylinder explode on you? Sorry! See that guy there? He's the one who flung it! You flat face! We ran outside because the gas was leaking And you took it and threw it outside! Thankfully I learnt stunts watching actor Ramarajan! Hence I could save everyone Else imagine what would have happened You fraud! Not you! You fraud! We rescued you and kept you safe, right? Do we look like killers to you? God! When I saw you both for the first time, I thought you were killers Shut up you milk pot! Helped you because you were fair and beautiful... but you doubt us? Why do these fair people always doubt the dark guys? -True boss! -Attaboy! -What? -Shut up! -You first, wear the top button -Plays without knowing the situation! -Who is this new girl? -Right! Who are you? Only we were there in this forest Now a new girl has entered here James... if anyone open their mouth to tell a story or speak philosophies... I am in the perfect position, I'll kick on your face! What was that, buddy? -Shut up! -Okay! If they got nothing to do with what happened... then who are those guy who tied us up in your place? Late pick! When did they come to our place? They haven't come to your place! It's you guys who are in their place! Their place? So... who are you? There was an undiscovered history between nature and science My bad for asking you Dr. Dhirendhiran, India's top most genetic researcher My father. He was missing since two years Few days ago, when I was checking his personal data in the drive... My team and I, in order to carry out research on some plants... have arrived at the South Sentinel island Today, when we were studying about few species on the field... It's usually an insect eating plant But the behaviour of the plant we saw today... was quite unusual! Cut it! Cut it fast! Do it! Nothing to worry! Nothing! Take her away Pavi, are you okay? -Are you fine? Okay? -Take her We will take care of her We collected few samples of that plant in order to carry out research on it Me and my students are at Kadaveri forest for an unofficial project We created a lab from scratch to do all the necessary research When I tested the samples of Dionaea muscipula, that we got from South Sentinel island... I observed that it had a quite unusual DNA structure that usual It was very different from it's original characteristics No! Sir -Everything is fine, right? -I am alright Here, sir. Have some water Sir, hope there is no problem Nothing. You can leave -Sir, are you sure? -You can go You can go and take rest -Okay, sir -Yeah -Good night, sir -Good night I developed that strange DNA... and believed I could bring a new revolution in the study of nature research Unfortunately all that belief was crushed! Our sir has ordered to drop the project He dropped the project? What's that all about? Not just that, he asked to leave to Chennai today Let that be. Why is the lab closed? He has prohibited us from entering into it Yes! It's beyond bio medical science Why are we talking to her? -Let's go in and check -Don't you disobey sir's orders! -Dude, are you coming or not? -Don't do this Sarathy! -Listen to me! -We're going! Why don't you guys listen? -He said don't enter! -Buddy! This looks new Yes, what I saw in that plant was... a replicated human DNA -Michael... -Sir was here after I left yesterday It wasn't here then Yes! Can you be quiet for a while? I didn't take it seriously when that plant caught on to Pavithra's leg But... only when I studied that plant's DNA today, I found that... it is... craving for human blood! There is something wrong with it! Don't you understand? -Don't touch it! Listen to me! -Pavi, shut up! The results could be vary drastically Pavi, shut up! Quiet! If we further continue here... it could result in a disaster! What happened to those guys? They turned into cannibals and have this forest under their control The humans who visit here are their food! In order to find out what happened to my dad... I came here with my friends They killed all my three friends If we have to survive and live... then we must escape from here There is only one way out What's that? There's a huge animal that's troubling everyone in this forest If we drive it to the cannibals... it'll take a week of them to feed on it In that interval, we can reach our home! Which animal are you talking about? Don't you know? Don't you see it? Hello! Can't you see it? No, I can't See that, he says he can't see you You pot boiler! Don't you mock me with that crappy face! One kick and your lips will be swollen! Are you gonna French kiss me? -I'll slap you! -Yeah right! Try your luck! I wanna see you beat me! Kindly adjust! By the way... where is Jeni? Drats! Yeah! Is she hiding inside the cupboard? She won't fit in Why are you blinking? She was with all night! Where is Jeni? Good generation! You killed her too? Azhaga, these guys will definitely kill us We must escape from here somehow Stop shaking me! Why? Is the rod poking you? It hurts! Buddy, look! Jeni! Jeni! Jeni! Let her go! I'm such a reputed carpenter... and how did I forget this? Paapi free yourself What are you doing? You fool! There are tools in the bag in my hip! Ask me and I'll free you You fool! If you had thought of this earlier, we could have save that girl Bloody rascal! Without realizing that we were tied up with soft chains, you were narrating the flashback Now are you feeling emotional? Shut up! Free them first I'll do it because you touched me Azhaga, untie me first! -He behaves like her puppet! -I'll come. Hold your trousers tight Whose briefs are you wearing? Your dad's? I have cut the chain now leave her hands! Get up! -Amudha! -Oh playing safe? Else you'll cheat me! What's up, dear? Are you done with your work? Go refresh yourself and... Paapi has prepared Dosa. Have it and do the dishes Joker! If you don't eat, you'll be punished! He ruined the game! Told you to go and eat! Why do you wanna get beaten up by this silly fellow? If you had ate, you wouldn't have been punished! Are you guys crazy or act like one? -What else did you expect? -Why'd you play when life is at risk? Come, let's go! Coming! Come on, Amudha! Uh-oh! The lock broke! Quick! Come fast! Amudha, there's another guy! Azhaga, let's run away He's dead! Amudha, Paapi! Dude, let's run away! Lidi! Come, let's run away Paapi... We didn't come here to die with them! Come on! Will you come or not? How can we leave them? Then go and die! Amudha! Let go of me Paapi, stay down! Paapi, are you okay? I am fine Move! Guys, come on! Come on before they get up! Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Quick! Buddy! Buddy! James! James! Vikram, come let's go! Quick! Come on! Come on! Amudha! Stop! Wait! Guys, get in! -James! -Come on, Vikram! Quick! The dog's right behind us! Go fast! Amudha drive fast! Don't yell! Shut up! Faster! You sit down! What are you doing? He rammed into the log! They are here I guess Amudha that's James' leg! Drive! Now! That's James hand! Amudha, he's approaching us! Drive! -Quick! -Drive Drive! Go! Get down and push! Quick! Go! Come on, drive! Now! Go! Go! Go! Now! Start the vehicle! Oh my God! Make it fast! Start! Won't I drive it it starts? I'm stuck behind all of them! How do I escape? Drive! Start the car! It's not starting! Amudha, start the car! Guys, hold on he's trying! He's throwing it like throwing a piece of meat on the frying pan! Lidi, doesn't look like the car is gonna start. All of you get down! Get down! Guys! Girls! Help me get down! Where are you guy off to leaving me? Open the door for me Dude, please! Open it for me! Don't leave me! Help! You guys leave Azhaga! Azhaga! Open it! Open it! What happened?

Samrin... you guys wait here I shall go and get help No Vikram I shall go If there's some trouble here... they will need you Lidi! Don't worry, Vikram I will come back for sure! Wherever you are in this forest... I will find you and save you guys! Lidi, careful! Let's stay connected Buddy...

Let's rest Even in that tense situation... why did Vikram have to take that bag and run? In that tense situation why did you take his bag and run? Just to check what's in it You're right What's this? How great would it be if we get a imported liquor here? It'd be top notch! Wow! Imported liquor! Give me some Remember fifth grade? I do Remember that egg incident? I begged yet did you give me some?
