I don't know. It's funny. I don't even know how to describe it. As a kid I heard women's bones rearranged after they gave birth I never checked if that was true. Not even when I grew up. Don't know why. Maybe because that feeling smacks of memories. I HAVE TO SLEEP, MY ANGEL This is me. I think I must be 9 here. That?s right, 1970. Nine. Third grade, second semester. The only thing that mattered to me then was the ball. The penalty kick will be taken by none other than the Velez centre forward, Dusko Bajevic. Face to face with Radomir Vukcevic Who will emerge victorious from this duel? The Neretva prince or the invincible Vucko? Vukcevic stands calmly at the goal. Bajevic steps back for the kick. All eyes are on them. He shoots and it's a goal!!! Vukcevic in one corner, the ball in the other! Then, in 1970, we were listening about the unrest in Ireland, arrests in Spain, the civil war in Jordan, the coup in Cambodia, massacres in Vietnam. As far as we could see, nothing good was afoot. And in our neck of the woods? It was peaceful. Whether or not we'll beat the USA in basketball was our main concern. Good evening. I couldn't make it earlier. We've had a tough case. What's with the look? I'm to blame again? -Can't you see how late it is? Do you know where I work and what I do? -That's not the problem. The problem is that you don't call. -Gordana, please. Don't burden me with obligations. -Obligations? Would you call because you must? People happen to you without you choosing them. They live their own lives but take part in yours too. They sign your emotional yearbook. The clumsier their handwriting, the more lasting the signature. It's sad you don't feel the need to call anymore. Some childhood memories have evaporated, and some I heard so many times about that I feel as if I'd been there. Mom and dad never could agree on who approached whom first. Back in 1961, when they first met. See those three? Always together when you don't need them to be! Can you see the big boned one? Remember. Just stand beside me. When I make my move... -But... Do as I tell you. Don't you worry about a thing! Ladies' choice. But they said it was ladies' choice. -If that's how you feel, then... We were the first to own a TV in the building. These events are a must. That's why all our neighbours and family will gather at our place. Grampa Risto says: "If we win this one, we'll get into everyone's hair." I didn't really know what that means but I sensed it was weighty. It was in all the newspapers, all over front pages. I'll have some of that brandy. Few people believe in their principles as firmly as he does. Couldn't you find a bigger one to hang? Remember this well, my son. A man can lose everything. A house, a job, a family, his health. But if he loses his ideals, then he is no longer a man! Grandma's convictions are slightly different. -How's that?! You've heard me alright. I told you 40 years ago. We shall celebrate our patron saint as I live and breathe! That's it! Aunt Mirjana, mom's kid sister. Looking at her, you couldn't tell she was an upstanding woman. A physics teacher. The older sister, aunt Biljana, didn't seem like her sister at all. Along with a much older husband and a new religion, she got Mesud. Her husband's son from the first marriage. This kid will be the death of me! Uncle Gojko - a good sort. He never said no to anything. Good evening. -Neighbour Maca. She married a sergeant 1st class, uncle Stevee, at the age of 16. All her life she's waited for some Rako who promised her an album. Aunt Safija, always around, always handy. What's the score? -We lead by four points. Skansi thought Williams had touched the ball. Kapieic. There are six more seconds left in the game. Yugoslavia is leading 69:63. That's a win for our team. Plecas will shoot two free throws. Never has the Tivoli hall resounded with shouts of bigger joy. This wasn't a game for the faint of heart. -That's it! Five more seconds, four, three. Two, one. The end. What a game! We're the best! World champions! World champions. Go on, kids. We congratulate all our players on this success. Dear viewers, this is the end of our world championship coverage. The president of the Organization Committee, Stane Dolanc. I am overjoyed. This gold medal will be a birthday present for Tito. Dad! Tell them I'll pay this afternoon. Good morning, uncle Stevce! -Son of a bitch! Good morning, son. Motherfucker! 'Morning. -Here you go. -Dad will pay in the afternoon. -That's fine. Don't you have a home to go? Goran, change and have breakfast. You'll be late. Mom, give him something. I must go. Go on, son, eat. I didn't like school except sports and maths. I knew I didn't have to study for maths. And soccer? I was the best player in all of the school. This door, this door handle. That stayed with me my entire life. I know the exact number of steps from the building to the school. Every street crossing. When it's raining and when we're late. I know the exact spot where the bag changes hands. I could find it with my eyes closed any time of day or night. Give it to me. Go in. Watch out! -What are you doing?! Ante, you'll fall down! Get down! Goran! Race you to mom! You're out of your minds. Don't be scaring me like that. Go on now. Take it, go on! Eat up, that's right. Some bread too. Thank you. -That's alright, it's on our way. Bye, love. -Bye. Good day, mother. -Good day. Here you go. -Thank you. -Here you are. How have you been doing? How's the blood pressure? -Fine. I'm taking that Birezit you proscribed. Goran is acing maths, just like I did. Is he now? Let's go. Every day it's the same. Go on home. Alright then. Drink up that juice. We must go. Have you read the new one? -Not yet, I'll bring it back. -It's not easy. Peppers are like people, each has its own character. Industrial peppers are baked and ground. They're called bukovec. Then we have these big red beauties, the so-called kami, that are used in the famous Macedonian ajvar. They are baked, beaten and then roasted for a long time. Gambits are mainly pickled. When filled with cabbage, they go great with brandy. Leave the children alone with those peppers of yours, let them take it. It will all go bad anyway. I've locked the lower lock. Pass it! How can you leave without talking to us? -It didn't seem important. You blow things out of proportion. -Of course it's important! You don't talk to me! You're not trying to work on our relationship. Why? -You think you are? -Yes, I think I am trying! How can you even ask that? Doesn't family matter to me most? I'm a part of that family. So I'm supposed to matter to you as well. Why don't you try to understand me then? -I don't? -No! How dare you attack me! You really think you're not to blame? I don't think I'm the only one. -I'm to blame as well? Why? Am I checking up on you? You expect me to have the same priorities! -Close that door. Try to make me understand then. -You listen, but you don't hear! Like you can hear me! What is so important to you that isn't to me? You don't know? How can I know if you don't? This is getting us nowhere. That won't do any good, my dear. Why don't you try adjusting to him? A woman must make a man feel strong, you have to support him. Take lunch to your dad. He's on call today, he won't have time to eat. Gordana, stir this so it doesn't burn. Get dressed and go on. You mustn't be so open with him. Play hard to get. They are hunters. Let them hunt. If you resent something, don't say it. Give it time. You'll get your way. Can you hear yourself? You talk about men as if they were retarded. You're telling me to be shrewd, to learn how to bargain. How can you manipulate someone you love? -They ask for it. They give only to those who think highly of themselves. -Mother. If what you're saying is love, then I don't want it. Good day. Don't breathe. I can't get anything down, doc. There's no end to this. Only boiled things. But I've had my fill of that. I feel pressure here, here, there. All the time! Three steps, I start huffing. I was going to work the other day... -Fine. Yes? Great. Siavica. You haven't had anything to eat, right? Help yourself, I'll be along. Put your clothes on. Here you go. Yes? -Am I interrupting? No. -Our colleague Vladic. Good day, doctor. -Good day. When did you get here? Yesterday. -You two know each other, that's right. The Santic high school, the class of 58. Let me just finish up here. See you. Come on. Look how beautiful they are. -They're lovely! Go on. Let me hear all about it. Good morning. Don't go yet. -It's late. Goran must go to bed. We all have an early morning tomorrow. -Good night. Time for bed, son. -Shall l leave dinner out for Ante? -No. Let's go. Good night. -'Night. Come here, Goran. Father and I would like to discuss something with you. Mother and I have decided to get a divorce. We haven't been getting along for some time now, we fight. Lucija's parents fight too but they're not getting a divorce. That's not it, son. We don't get along as husband and wife should. You'll stay here with your mother, I'll move to uncle Gojko's. You'll still see your father. He'll come to pick you up. We'll all be seeing each other. But we won't live together anymore. Don't get angry. Practice with your wife, then come and play. Here's my friend! Have a seat, Risto. -Give the kid some soda. You or me? -You go on. Poor thing, how will you make it on your own? -She was born alone. What will people say? -What's the matter with you? Don't scare her. I know the deal. Goran will want for nothing. He'll have both parents. My dear Gordana! Maybe it's still not final. Your Ante is a good man, you should have listened to him. Try to get back together. -What are you talking about?! You're crazy! Don't fight! -How can I not? It drives me nuts. Women are taught to serve men and depend on them. Not to think for themselves. -Where did you get that twisted philosophy! Do you know what century this is? -Do you know where this is? -I do. This is a Neanderthal cave. -Let me tell you something. You're intolerant and judgemental! Conflicted with those Neanderthals. Not everyone is like you, some want a normal life! And what do you consider normal? -Enough! Gordana. Where's that coat? -Here it is. Thanks. I'll come pick you up on Sunday, like we said. -Fine. Next week I have the afternoon shift, just so you know. Every third weekend I'm on call. -Alright. You have Gojko's number. I'll be off now. I think I got everything. I'm off. You got settled in alright. -I don't know how I'd survive without this. Cheers. -Cheers. I knew you'd end up like this. Women are evil blood, pal. A holy terror. We can't do without them and they pull our strings. It can't be as simple as you say. -Even more so. So the problem is that we men can't choose. -Not that. Want to know what we can't do? We can't defend ourselves from them! How can we, when we can't see what we're up against! You can only see her! And what does she do? Goes off with the highest bidder. You don't know what's a bigger favour: if she leaves or if she stays. And why is that? There's not one among them who ever quits her calculations! Why aren't you eating? Go on, it will get cold. Mirjana, is that enough eggs? -Sure. -Leave the bread, take this. Take this too. Happy patron saint's day, lady of the house. -Welcome! -Mother. Dearest! Let's get the kids to the table. -No! -Wash your hands and sit down. Why aren't you wearing a bra? -Bra is for cold weather only, mother. You really are crazy! -A woman's body must not be restrained. Be that with a bra, a garter, a ring, a necklace. Or a hand around the neck. Risto. Put a hat on. It's cold. Windy. Have you eaten? I'll eat when I come back. God be with you. Gramps. I'm coming with you. Goran. Come back inside. Go up. Listen to your mother. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Blessed be our Lord. Bless this bread and wine with Your holy spirit, Christ. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. -Amen. Lady of the house, happy patron's day. May St. Simeon protect you. -Thank you, Reverend. Postman! Maybe it's for me. Safija's husband went off to America some four years ago. Said he'd send her a card when he finds his bearings. Not a letter or a card since he left. What can she do, poor thing. Keeps hoping, as anyone would. Goran. Come here. Have you told your mother to see me today? -I think she's here. -Fine. Good day. -There's a Republic math competition in the fall. Goran has great chances but he has to work. -You know that's hard. How? -These tests. We'll work at school but he must practice more. He will, with his dad. -He's a good kid. He should gain confidence in things where he's brilliant. -Thanks. Bye. Gordana. Goran's teacher said she'd call you in about the competition. Great. Yes, but he must practice. Good day. How is Goran doing? -He's fine. A handful, but that's to be expected at his age. -And how are you? Alright. -How are you coping? Well. -Have a nice day. Bye. -Goodbye. I can't believe it. He's still sweet on you. -Leave me alone! Bye. Go on into the room, I'll be right in. Are you taking good care of this kid of mine? -I am, uncle Nikola. Get us something to drink. Good evening. Are you done? It's late. Hurry up a bit. How have you been doing? The back still hurts? Risto has some ointment. Want to try? -No need. Go on, honey. Come back tomorrow morning. Lucija must go to bed too. Good evening. Come on, love, you must have a bath. Where are you off to? -To the retirement home for backgammon. Have you done everything for tomorrow? -I have. -He did, I saw it. Are you done? -I am. -Let me see. Excellent. You were a little hasty on the last one, here's the mistake. We'll do it together. Look. 10 times 3. -30. Minus 4 times 6. Multiplying, not adding. Makes? Who's volunteering? He'll get the change. -I will! Two beers, three sodas. Scram. Let's hear it. -Two beers and three sodas. -Can you carry that alone? I can. -Here you go. Goran. Come here. Sit down. What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to have school? I am Marija, your dad's colleague from work. Goran. -I hear you're a straight A student. I better go now. My break's over. It was nice meeting you, Goran. Bye. My mother died when l was in the second grade. I remember her being quite the opposite of my father, a red-faced, obese and hard man, a tyrant disliked by all. Goran, wash up, supper time. Sad and small like a little girl. She was as fragile as a flower. But her body possessed a strength that no toil could sap. Always clean, neat and smiling like a doll. She had time for everything and was always on time everywhere. Goran? Goran! Dear Lord! What did you... What happened? -Help me! Where are the shoes? -Never mind the shoes now! God help me! It's gonna be alright. Easy. Relax your head. Lean it forward, easy. Then gently back. Good. Let's check this now. Does this hurt? -A little. How about this? This? Fine. We must wait for the arm X-ray. What's wrong with him? It's nothing serious? -I don't think so. Could you wait outside? Do you want us to notify Dr. Vladic? -If you like. Clean the wound. Nurse, give me the X-ray. Thank you. It's going to be alright, calm down. Come in. He broke his arm, he'll get a cast. I don't think he's had a concussion but if he throws up, bring him in. What happened? Let me see. How did he fall? Where were you? Does he have to stay or can he go home? -He can go home. I'll take them. Come here, slowly. Slowly. Come on. Happy Easter. -Happy Easter. It looks nicer the way you've rearranged it. You know where the toilet is, on the left. You know what I think about that family. -Put yourself in my shoes. It's time you let go of certain things, to forgive. -To forgive what? Them for killing your father? Never! -Please, mother. If you had any respect for yourself and your people, you'd understand. Good evening, Goran. Are you well? Reading, are you? Keeping the old ball going? You are good. I watched you the other day. Good evening. How are you? -Fine. -She'll be right out. Gordana! Good evening. I won't be long. Well then... I simply don't tolerate that. I've always had my principles. If we agree on something, nothing else is of interest for me. Understand? Take me, for example. Everything I've ever done was like that. If I start something, I must see it through. How else could I live with myself, understand? I better go now. Goran is not used to me going out. No problem. Just let me get the check. Check, please. Here you go. -Thank you. I had a lovely time tonight. -Yes, it was lovely. Thank you for the dinner. Good night. Good night. Good evening. Will you come in for a drink? -Thanks, I'm in a hurry. Just give him these tests to go through. These are the last ones. Tell him to read the problems carefully and not be hasty. Thank you very much. -You're welcome. -Bye. How's the work coming along? Any extra parts like the last time? Come on, you two, supper. -What time is it? -10 past 8. Turn on the TV, news have started. The people of Zagreb with the units of the First and Second Armies of the heroic national liberation army, Yugoslav partisan companies and with the 1 0th Zagreb Corps. I don't like this. Not one little bit! What is that? What did you bring? -Lucija said she needed it. Have you asked your mother? She might need it. -She doesn't. Are you sure? -I am. Go into Lucija's room, children. Comrades, we must not allow that Matica Hrvatska, or the groups in power there, delude our people and constantly use various channels and papers they control to plant criticism of the Communist Party, its failure... Go to the room, children. You sorry excuse for a man! Good morning, folks. What good brings you here? -Nothing good. Work, uncle Risto. What kind of work must be done at this hour? -The kind that can't wait. We must act quickly. Do you know where that neighbour of yours is? -No idea, sonny. I haven't seen him around. -How about his wife and kid? What do you want with them? -I need to ask the wife something. Leave the wife alone. What can she tell you? If you need him, it's him you should look for. -Very well then. Have a good day. -You too, son. Give my best to your old man. What are you sitting around for, old woman? Give the kids some food. We won't let them take apart the most sacred thing we have: the brotherhood and unity of all the Yugoslav nations and minorities. I'll take that. -Hush! -Do you have everything? -I think so. Grandma, can you manage? -I can, Ana. -Slowly. God only knows if we'll every see each other again! Don't say that, Ana, dear. Go on. Gordana. Thank you. You can start, children. What can you do? There are things you cannot change. But you must accept them. How could I make you understand? The same goes for people. You must try to understand them. Why some do this, others do that? Get it? Who is it? Goran, your mother's very upset. Come on. Risto. I didn't expect Goran to be so... About that little girl. He's only a child. He'll forget. Don't let go! Pick it up! -It's heavy! Like hell it is! Pick it up and move on! -Alright! Easy. And you call yourself a man! Anyone up for chestnuts? -Yeah! -Give us a big one. Here we go. Here we are. Where's Gordana? She lied down. She isn't feeling very well. What's wrong with her? -Says she's got pains down there, something... I'll see what it is. What's the matter? -Nothing. Go sit over there. Just lie down. -I've been having some pains here. But it's better now, I've taken a pill. Does this hurt? -No. -This? -No. How about here? -A little. You'll need to get a blood and urine test. I'll call the gynaecologist. When have you been to see one? -Not for a long time. Maybe it's a slight inflammation and maybe it's nothing. But you must have it looked into. It'll be fine. See you. Good day. Gordana Vladic. Over here. -Come in. She's feeling better, yes. She called from work, said her tests were good. Bye, Ante. Say hi to Gojko. Have you heard? -I have! That's great! -Let's go see her. You finish up your homework, we won't be long. Goon! I knew he'd write! He's sending a plane ticket. He said to bring only summer clothes, it's always summer there. Show us what you made. -Right. You look great! -Here it is. Here you go. -Thank you. This is a bachelor's pad after all. It's obvious it lacks a woman's touch. It doesn't look bad. -Take a seat. You furnished it nicely. I'm sorry, I really can't. Sorry. Danijel Vajs, grade average: A. Here you go. -Thanks. -Goran Vladic, grade average: A. Here you go. -Thanks. -There you go, children. You have the summer before you. Have a good rest. Do your reading. And next year... Mom's A student, the best in the world! -Enough already! Come over here. Take a look. Time is the only thing without a price and it is worth the most. You have to learn how to talk to it. You mustn't rush before it. Nor lag behind it. Never betray it and it will be your best friend. Look at this. We'll put it here, son. It will wait for you until you grow up. Nobody's going to touch it there. Granny's dearest! Good day. There he goes harping on the sad ones! Play something cheerful. Yes? Am I interrupting? -No, come on in. I've been to the hospital again. I went to do some tests a week ago, I got the results back today. Let me see. You'll have to get a surgery. Don't worry, it's not that bad. We'll see who's the best in the field. Fine. I'll be off now. -See you. I'm sorry, I really am. It would be best if you brought Goran with you to lunch on Sunday. You know children. It will take time until he gets used to this situation. Anyway, that will make it easier both on him and on all of us. All of us? Who's us? What do you mean? You, me. Mistake. This was a mistake. A mistake? What do you mean, a mistake? What are you talking about? I'm asking you: what mistake? For once in your life call spade a spade! You know what? You are not my mistake. I've talked to the doctor. He'll see us on Thursday. How could they miss it the first time around? -It's possible. The pains were symptomatic of genital organs. Large intestine hurts the same way. We've caught it on time. Everything will be fine. See you, Ante. -Yes. You promised to do as granny says. No late TV-watching. Alright then. Is everything in there? -It is. Let's not kiss each other goodbye. I'm not going around the world. See you in a couple of days. Goran. How's your mother? -Well. She'll be back on Wednesday. Give her my best. -I will. Goran, dear, take your things and go out. Gramps Risto has died two hours ago. The ambulance came but it was too late. He didn't suffer much. His heart just stopped beating. We called your mom and dad, they're coming tomorrow. Let's go home now. Have a seat, son. You'll be sleeping at our place. It's going to be hectic around here. I'll stay here. -Listen to your uncle. It won't be for long. You can see there are no children here. My love! In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. -What was that? Gramps told me to give it to the band on his funeral. Attention! Load! Aim high! Fire! Fire! Fire! I'm going up to see how mom's doing. I told them I'll be back on work next Monday. -Extend the sick leave. No. There's no point in staying in bed. I feel better now. -Fine then. I'll be off now. -You could stay for dinner. -No, thanks. I'm not hungry. What is missing? -Two from FC Hajduk and one from FC Partizan. There are better things to spend money on. -See you tomorrow. Goodbye. Bye. Good day. How are you? -Well, son. How are you? Fine. Goran. Come on your own sometime. You needn't always come with your dad. -Alright. Please, come in. One for you. -Thanks. -And you. Go on. You two, give me a hand. So you're leaving for America? -In ten days. What's the matter?! -What is it? Ante! -Your mother fell down. What happened? -Lie down. Just lie down. You passed out from the pain. It will be alright. Lucky for us there's a doctor in the house. Let's eat. Come on, son. We'll have to go to Ljubljana again. I got the results today, they're bad. She'll have to have another surgery. It'd be good if you came along. Alright. -I'm coming too. -We'll be right back. You'll stay at aunt Biljana's. -No, I'm going with you. She's sleeping. But we can come in. She should wake up any minute now. Come here. Let me take a look at you. What's been going on? -Uncle Gojko's bought a Renault. Doctor. I'll let in some air. Tell me if you're cold. Open them. I'm not cold. Look at her! Where did you come from? I was late for the plane. -Dear Lord! -It happens, what can you do? How are you doing? You sure look nice. I'm feeling better. But you weren't late for the plane, right? -I wasn't. That's no good for me. -Have some apple. -No, thanks. Where's Goran? -I don't know. There are no words to describe how much I loved you. There wasn't a thing I wouldn't do for you. You awoke another me inside, filled with love. My true self. I felt my heart wanting only one thing: to get through to yours. I can't understand how your heart couldn't recognize that love. Go on, son, grandma's waiting. -But I want to stay. Why can't l? I have to sleep, angel. Come on, son. Mom must have her rest. When are you coming home? -I must be here for a while. Dad will stay with me. Come here. Give me a little, tiny one. Put in this cassette. Ladies' choice. Mom, I forgot to tell you something. Mom. Mom! We'll stop for lunch at some friends of mine in Zagreb. Will you be able to drive that late? -I will. I'll take a break at their place. I'll get something. We can't come empty-handed. -I'm coming too. Look up. There's somebody waiving to you. Wait for us on the bench. See? People happen to you without you choosing them. They live their own lives but take part in yours too. They sign your emotional yearbook. The clumsier their handwriting, the more lasting the signature. Later your handwriting gets harder to read, both for you and others. Until you start understanding and loving it for what it is. Goran. -Let's go. Come on, son.
