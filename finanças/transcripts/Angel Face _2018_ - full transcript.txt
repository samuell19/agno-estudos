A friend of mine opened a bar. All the stars go there. - Like who? - Only the best. Britney, Miley... De Niro. You don't believe me. Check it out. Who's she? Another round. Hey, Marlene. Your kid's emptying glasses. Bullshit! Hey, Elli! Don't you ever do that! You hear me? Don't you ever do that! - No big deal, relax. - You stupid bitch! Chill. Who cares? We're partying here. C'mon!

Get in! Don't you make a scene. You're a big girl now. Take her to 25 Rue du Jour, please. At the boardwalk near the harbor. Mommy You've reached Marlene's voicemail. I'm not available right now. Leave me a message. You've reached Marlene's voicemail... You're too little, sorry. You can't go without an adult. What's your name? Julio. I'll stay a little longer. Now that I'm here. I couldn't come sooner, sorry. Your mom sent me a text asking me to look after you, but... I didn't realize... Anyway. Here. I got groceries. If you want. I don't know what kids your age eat. My treat. I know we're not very close yet. But your mom... She always says you're smarter than her. So, you know? She says, "My kid's so smart, I must've fucked Einstein in the dark!" "I must've confused Zidane's groin with Einstein's brain!" She cracks me up. So my dad's name was Einstein? No. It's just an image. When's she coming home? Real soon. She'd better. You can't leave me with your kid, I'm terrible with kids! Damn it, Marlene, answer me! Fuck this! 1, 2, 3, sunshine! You moved! You moved! Look at Elli. - Too much makeup. - She looks like a cougar. What's a cougar? It's a lady, an old lady, who... does the nasty with young men. - Why are they called cougars? - Just because. - You don't wear makeup to school. - She's a clown. - She's weird. - She's a girl clown in makeup. Elli... Elli? Ever slept with anyone? I don't know. But... do you know how? Yes. I love you. My Angel Face, it's Mommy. Don't you dare worry about me. Everything will be fine. Mommy loves you, you know. Loads, loads, loads. Cross my heart and hope to die! You're the most important thing in my heart. My Angel Face, you're the only one who understands me. Do you hear me? Your mommy loves you so much. Believe me. I need a little time. But it's gonna be alright. I'm not far. Everything's fine, Elli. I promise. Don't think I don't think about you. I think about you all the time. I love you loads, loads, loads! Let's go over our plans for our fall play. This year we're doing tales of the sea. I gave you some roles last time, remember? Settle down please, kids. Settle down. Who's gonna be the little mermaid? Elli will be the little mermaid. Quiet or you won't be in the play. That's enough, kids. Settle down. Stop. Tag, you're it! That hurts! Elli, you lose! You stink of booze! Elli, you lose! You stink of booze! Jump, Elli. Jump. Go for it. Jump. Let's go, kids! Hurry up! Finish getting dressed. Quietly. Angel Face! Angel Face! Sweetie! Marlene, Marlene! Angel Face! Over here, look left! Thank you! - Marlene, over here! - Give us a smile! This is the principal of your daughter Elli's school. Your daughter has been absent for two days with no word from you. School is mandatory. Your daughter must have an excuse. We've already had this discussion. Call me back as soon as possible to explain Elli's absence. Hello, Elli. Look who's coming. Let's have some fun. - Isn't that Marlene's kid? - Yeah. Hey, midget! I'm talking to you! Did your mom go missing? She's long gone, the slut! Where'd she go? I did this with her! Your mom's smokin' hot! Turn around, fight back. What's she doing? Hang on now, no kicking. - What're you doing? - Get away. What you gonna do? Think you're tough? We'll meet again, asshole. Fuck off, asshole. This is our turf. You dog. You ok? You live here? Do you know Alberto? He's your dad. Wanna come up? Go home now. Get going. I'm watching. Go on. Get in front, I'll take you back. No. I know how to dive too. Last year I jumped off the high dive. Where are your parents? They must be worried. I don't know who my father is. It was in the dark. And my mom's not around anymore. Got anything to drink? There's Fanta in the fridge. And the tap water's fine. Got something a little stronger? No. What's that on your arms? I don't know. Each date is a victory. A day when I won. These are measurements. The height of my dives. The distance between me and the water. Happy? And what's this? That's my heart. They took it out. And put it back in? Yeah. Now I have to take good care of it. There, so you won't forget. I'll take you home now. No! I don't want to! Don't leave me alone! Don't leave me! Don't leave me alone! Don't leave me alone! I don't want to! I don't want to! Don't leave me alone! When I was little, I practiced my dives here. My dad worked at the factory nearby. At first I'd get dizzy, then it stopped. I can't dive anymore. My heart would explode. Why won't your dad let you in? Because I was a brat. Sometimes people act badly and regret it later. But then it's too late. Let's go. A man of about fifty... A drunk, no doubt. Does it happen a lot? Dunno. Sometimes. People jump. You never know why. You shouldn't be here. Move away, please. You can't stay here. Please. I'm not far. Everything's fine, Elli. I promise. Don't think I don't think about you. I think about you all the time. I love you loads, loads, loads! My mother's dead. Don't tell anyone. Why not? They throw away kids who are alone. What about your dad? Is this your snack? Gonna finish it? Kids... the costumes are here. Don't touch, they're fragile. Just look. Listen up. They're very fragile. Touch with your eyes. Elias, want the starfish? Elli, will you come here, please? Where's the jellyfish? Starfish? Girls, which do you want? That's not your costume, it's Elli's. Here, for the mermaid. Fishes... Starfish? Girls, which do you want? Ok, fine. What about the little crab? You want that one? Who'll be our pirates if you're all starfish? My mom's prettier than her. I'd like to talk to your mom. That's no way to eat ice cream. Here, let me show you. Careful! You got it up my nose. - We're putting on a play at school. - Yeah? I'll be dressed up. - As what? - Guess. I'm no good at guessing. Seriously, I'm not. Try, at least. Smurfette? I have a blue body and green eyes. So not Smurfette. Give me a hint. - A penguin. - No. - Madonna? - No. A dancer? - A belly dancer. - No. I don't know, Elli. I won't tell. That way you'll be surprised when you see me. Ok. "I live in the ocean. "My head's in the stars. I want to see the world above. "Up above. The people, houses and gardens. "I want a beautiful soul. "I want the joys of the earth and the sky too." That's my poem. I'm saying it in the play. Bravo. It's... very pretty. Do you mean it for real? You bet. Will I get dizzy on stage? I don't know, Elli. So, is he your dad? Are you a cliff diver? Cliff divers think they're hot stuff. This guy's full of shit. - Is he your dad? - Mr. Shitty Pants. Yeah, he's my dad. As if I'd believe you. Superman. Get lost. Elli? Why do you lie? Sorry, sorry... All is well. I'm on a trip. I love you. All is well. I'm on a trip. I love you. Mommy. Angel Face? Elli! Elli! Angel Face! Elli! Angel Face! Elli! Mathilda! Open the door, please. Open up, goddammit! I know you're home! C'mon, open up! Where's my daughter? Have you got her? Give her back to me! I want my daughter! Elli! Give me my daughter! Let me in! - Elli? - She's not here, Marlene. Come here right now, sweetie! What have you done? Come right now! You're scaring my kid. Honey, did you see Elli today? Is everything alright? That's not Elli's mom, it's a ghost. Elli's mom is dead. Open the door. It's Marlene, the neighbor. Please. I don't know where to look anymore. I don't know anymore... When I was away... I stopped thinking. I didn't think about anything. I don't know why I'm telling you this. Aren't you afraid of being alone forever? What are you doing here, Elli? Tell me. What do you think you're doing here? I made dinner. You shouldn't be here. I'm not your father. Do you understand? I love you and I want to live with you. Hey guys, check it out. Mike Tyson's here. Wanna fight? Bring it on, I'm ready. What are you drinking? Seriously? Is she serious? - I'm serious. - Give her some, for a laugh. Don't drop it, kid. She can handle it. Respect. How old are you? - I'm eleven. - Really? Yeah. You're not eleven, are you? Yes. My sister's eight and she's bigger. I give whisky to my toys to help them sleep. She takes it straight, even. She handles it better than you. Here. 1... 2... 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... You're the one who gave her the bottle. Run guys, he's gonna kick our asses! Go on. Come to Mommy. My Angel Face... Hello. Joliot Curie school? Yes. Are you the principal? So, I'm calling you because.... my daughter is sick. Right. Elli. Yes, Elli's my daughter. Ok. I can make more if you like. There's bread, I went shopping. I'm not hungry. The school principal told me the play is tomorrow. That's so cool. I don't want you to come. "I want to see the world up above. "The people, houses and gardens. "I want a beautiful soul." Go on, drink! Prove it, do it! Do it for real! Show us your stuff! Drink! You're chicken. Whatever! Now we need our little girl of the sea. Our kind-hearted princess. Our little mermaid. Our kind-hearted princess. Our little mermaid. Our little mermaid... Burly Octopus and Baby Crab to the rescue. My little fishies, have no fear. Excuse me, I'm looking for Elli. She plays the mermaid. - Have you seen her? - No. Thanks. - Excuse me, know who Elli is? - Yes. Have you seen her? She plays the mermaid. Don't worry, she can't be far. Have you seen her? Hey! Help me. I live in the ocean. My head's in the stars. I want to see the world above. Up above. People, houses... The joys of the earth and the sky too. The joys of the earth and the sky too. ANGEL FACE Subtitles by Sionann O'Neill Subtitling TITRAFILM
