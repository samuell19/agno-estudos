(Hi, Erika.) (Hi, love.) (Morning.) (Let's go to work.) (No, we just got back from work.) (What are you saying?) (Bye, Godspeed.) (Bye, love. Work hard.) (Let's have dinner later.) (Hi, Carlos.) (Hi, Ms. Neusa. How are you?) (Oh, nice pumpkin.) (You have a new grandson?) (Yes, he's adorable.) Welcome home. Good to see you. She's Nadia, the one I told you about. Nice to meet you. I'm Nadia. Hello. I'll take that. - Don't bother. - It's fine. Manabu, Nadia, congratulations on your marriage! Congratulations! Cheers! Thank you. Manabu, how did you two meet? She works at the cafeteria at my workplace. Who made the first move? What? Well, I did. Good for you! She didn't take me seriously at first. Thought I was teasing her. She worried about our social standings. Why would she be concerned about that? That's how her native country works. Did you two go say hello to her parents? She's an orphan. Her family was caught up in a war when she was little. Seiji, did you know? Yeah. I see. She learned English at a refugee school and worked hard to get her job. You've been through so much. Seiji never tells us anything. Says she's happy now. Go ahead, eat. Thank you. Both of you eat and get your stamina up. I can't wait to see your baby! - What did she say? - Don't interpret it. I won't. You're always so vulgar! I'll help you. You'll get dirty. It's OK. She's nice. You think so? - Yeah, she's nice. - I'm glad. Though I was surprised when I first heard. You seemed stunned over the phone. Manabu. I hope you didn't marry her out of pity. I wondered if that was the case and thought a lot about it at first. You know, my job has taken me to many places and I've seen different worlds. So much hate and discrimination. And there I met Nadia. So many of her loved ones had been Killed, Yet she smiles so happily. Yeah. Dad. - Hmm? - Listen. I'll be a potter here. What are you saying? You have an important job. I've already told the company. The plant in Algeria will be complete in 3 months, so I'm resigning then. Tell them you take it back. Why? Just do it. Look. It's been years since Masakatsu's kiln shut down. Yasue's factory has been gone... 5 years now. You can't make a living as a potter. We'll manage... - ...if we work hard... - What about Nadia? She's been through hell and finally met you, right? You've got to protect her smile. (Bia broke up with her boyfriend.) (Really? He was so cute.) (Maybe I'll flirt with him.) (Damn, why?) (Just kidding.) (Let's go.) (Good one, Rui!) (Go! Go!) (So, ladies, enjoying the party?) (Today is on me. I want to see everyone drunk.) (Let's drink up!) (What's he doing?) Hey! (Shit!) (Out of my way!) (Manoel!) (What did he do?) (He stole from them.) (From their whorehouse?) (Gotta help him! You go home.) (Let's go!) Hey, you! What do you want? (Help! Someone help!) (Manoel, run!) (Go, run!) (Run away!) You little shit! What've you done? Stop it, please! Get over here! (Run, Rui!) (What about you?) (Just go, damn it!) (Run away!) Don't mess with us! Go after him. (Piece of shit.) What happened? It's OK. Don't come! I won't do anything! Calm down! It's OK. It's OK. Ow! - Stop that. - Let go! Let go! Just calm down! (Let me go!) Let go of me, damn it! Hold it right there! We'll take care of you, so stop struggling! All right? No more violence! Manabu, you OK? Can you get up? You OK? You OK? All right. They were after you? Let's go see a doctor. I'll come along. Change into this. You from the Ho-oka housing complex? OK. OK, OK. Will this be all right? It'll manage to run. Oh no. Hey, he's gone. His shoes are missing. Uncle Tetsuya. I told Dad... That I'd quit my job and be a potter. What did he say? Not to do it. Are you against it, too? I don't think it's a bad idea. But I understand how your father feels, too. When he gets drunk, he always brags about you. How you're smart. How you're kind, just like Akiko. This might be hard to believe, but Seiji used to be an uncontrollable roughneck Who changed after he met my sister. When Akiko became pregnant with you, he promised to go straight. She introduced Seiji to his pottery mentor, And he quickly got into the craft. Akiko was delighted. She'd go sell Seiji's cups by the roadside with you on her back. She was always beaming even if she couldn't sell any. She believed in his ceramics. It was only for a brief period, but... She was happy. "Morning glory.” "Aco... acor...” "Acorn.” "Swallow.” "Whale.” "Rabbit.” "Rabbit.” "Jellyfish." "Nosebleed.” "Sparrow.” "Pig.” "Pig.” Excuse me. Yes? Is this Kamiya Studio? Yes. Um... Here, I heard you helped Marcos. You're his friend? Is he OK? Yes. You gave him first aid, right? Thanks. How is he? I told him to come thank you. But he said he didn't want to, so I came alone. I see. Thanks for coming. What's up? She's that young man's friend. I hope Marcos didn't cause you trouble. He didn't tell you? Tell me what? This. He did that? (I can't believe it. What an idiot!) I'm so sorry. I'll make amends. I'll pay for this. You don't have to. - But... - It's fine. Then please join us for lunch this weekend. We're having a party. Let us treat you in return. I'll make Marcos apologize. I'll come pick you up, so please. Why don't we go, Dad? No, I'll pass. Sorry. He's shy. Hey, there. Hello. Listen, don't bother coming from tomorrow. - What? - Why? I heard you slugged Kaito Enomoto's men. There's no way we can keep you on. (Those bastards!) (Jerks!) Here's the rest of your pay for this week. Pick it up. (Stop.) Do it. I'll have you arrested for assault! (Calm down.) Worthless Brazilian. (He cussed us out!) (Cool it.) (Why'd you stop me?) (We're fired anyway.) (Think a little bit.) (Everyone, Mr. Kamiya is here!) (Marcos!) Let me introduce my mom. (Mom, this is Mr. Kamiya.) My mom. (My God! So it was you!) Marcos's mom. Mr. Kamiya, over here. (Is the churrasco ready?) (Here, it's ready.) (Careful, the sausage is hot!) Oh, here it is! (The meat's done just right!) - Great! - Looks good! (You're my son Marcos' guardian angel. Thank you for saving him.) (Make yourselves at home. Fat and enjoy.) Thank you for saving Marcos. (Marcos!) (Come!) (Apologize and say thank you.) (Not like that!) (Do it right.) (Marcos, come!) (You sit here.) (Sit.) (You really are very beautiful and very kind, too.) (Why don't you come live here? You're already family.) You two are handsome so you should come live in this housing complex. Let's dance! (Let's dance!) Dance! Dance! That's the way! Good! Great! Tired? Could I show you something? I'm in a rap group with some friends. This is our music video. Wow, that's cool. Our dream is to make it big and get out of this place. Your dream will come true. Really? Thanks! Where did you two meet? Algeria. Algeria? Where is that? It's a country in the north of Africa. Cool. I wish I could visit another country. For example? Hawaii. My dream is to work hard and take my family there. Sounds good. What's your dream? I don't have one. Marcos. Why not? I'm scared to. What do you mean? The Japanese killed Marcos's dad. (Erika, be quiet.) He was fired because of the recession. Marcos's dad's dream was destroyed. So Marcos hates the Japanese. (They'll never understand.) Marcos. Having a dream isn't something to be scared of. What song is that? It's a lullaby that her mother used to sing. Her mother was Killed in an air raid when she was four. She doesn't remember her face, and only remembers this song. The song is home to her. She sang it every time she lost a friend in a refugee camp, And it eased her sadness a little. What did you say? I told her you're quick to tears. Thank you. Thank you. This is pretty hard. I used to be a bit better at it before. OK, kick. Try it again. Slowly. Relax a bit more. OK, one more time. Good. I became so absorbed in this, Though it made no money. So your mother worked and worked... until she got sick. Nadia said... "Let's make a family here.” She has no home, but this will become her home. So Dad... I'll come back here. They're so cute. So cute. Thanks. It's all right. Please take care of him. Yes. We're off, then. Take care of yourself. See you. Goodbye. (Sleep, my child, so the monsters won't come) (Dad went to the fields, Mom went to work) (Jana!) (Yuna.) (Take this money.) (What happened?) (I love you.) (I love you.) (No, don't go!) (I love you.) (No, Manoel, please!) (Sorry.) (Please don't go, Manoel!) (Let go!) - Get out! - Please don't! Please don't! I'll give back the money, so please don't kill me! We just had a baby. Then bring that kid here. I'll sell the kid instead of you. (Not my daughter!) (Jana!) (Yuna!) (Thanks as always.) Hi. Here. Hiiragi Gakuen is closing down. Financial difficulties. I see. They're planning a closing ceremony. Will you go? I'll pass. Why? It's where we grew up. It's not like I remember it fondly. Well, yeah, but... So how was Manabu's wife? He brought her over, right? She lost her parents in a war when she was little. So she grew up under similar circumstances as us. The hell that she's been through... Can't be compared to our upbringings. What? Manabu is you and Akiko's son, all right. How's yours doing? Still hanging around. I'm about to retire but still supporting him. Retirement, huh? We're that age now. Just an ordinary cop all these years, but no regrets. I made it this far at least. You're a fine cop, Takashi. Dad! Listen, Dad! I've got good news! Hello. Wow. What is it? I came to give you this. Mom insisted that I bring you this money to repair your truck. No, the meat at the party made us even. If you don't accept it, Mom will Kill me. She weighs 100kg. She's scarier than a pro wrestler. Here. (Marcos, come on.) I'm sorry. Where's Manabu? Back in Algeria. Too bad, I wanted to chat with him. "3,000 yen” Give these to your mom. Really? A token of thanks for the party and money. It's lovely. Thank you. Wrap them in this. When did you two come to Japan? When we were five, with Marcos's family and Rut's. So you grew up together. Yes. We entered elementary school here but didn't know the language. We couldn't keep up with schoolwork and couldn't afford high school, So we only finished junior high. Manabu works all over the world. He's awesome. He is. But I only graduated junior high. Really? Same as you. How long does this burn? 3 days and 3 nights. I stay up and keep watch. What? You do that by yourself? Yeah. On the third day, a pillar of fire blows up from that chimney. Wow. I want to see that flame. May I come? I'll help you. You don't have to. No, I'll come. From the run-down projects ls where I'll rise from nothing Practically the slums, crime abounds, robberies and killings Discrimination, threat of deportation Always tagged as foreigners, gaijin, A menace, still a brat, how exasperating I'll keep that promise and win the bling I'll be someone's dream, my turn to... Yo. We can't find Manoel. Whose fault is it? Why don't you pay back the 5 million he stole from our business? 3,000 Brazilians live in this housing complex, right? Sell that to all of them. We can't. Erika, was it? Lots of dudes want to do Brazilians. We'll hold on to this. Happy now? Get out of here! Let's go. (Rui, wait!) (Why'd you take that?) (Calm down!) (Calm down?) (I'm not selling drugs here in this housing complex!) (If we don't do it, what will happen to Erika?) (They'll make her an addict and force her to prostitute.) (Are you OK with that?) (Let's go!) (Is that them?) (I think it is.) You the ones selling drugs? Yes. Here's 5 million. Rui! Rui! Stop! Stop! Let go! Who do you think you are? Be glad you're not dead. Please. Give us the 5 million. Give it back. Please. Please. (Rui! Rui! Hey!) Please! Give back the 5 million! Please! Hello? Oh, hi, Kaito. We got your stuff. What now? You sell the drugs. But don't play games with me regarding sales, OK? Of course not. Why would we do that? We do good business together. What do we do with them? Punish them a bit more and then throw them out. We're not done wringing them. So don't kill them. Understood. Let us know If you need anything again. - Thanks. - Say hi to your dad for me. I'll tell him. Little brat. (Parana? Me too! Where in Parana?) (Curitiba.) (Oh, Curitiba? Me too!) You never call me back. Have you been busy? Hey. Move. Just move. Huh? What's wrong? Move. What the hell? Move. You're Erika, right? That Brazilian's woman. (Go away!) You're hot. Be my woman before Kaito-san makes you prostitute. You don't want to lick filthy balls every day, do you? I'll give you a good life. (Go away! Disgusting!) (Idiot!) Wait. Wait! Stop following me! How energetic. Let's go. (Go away!) Taxi! Go! Wait! (Answer.) The person you're trying to reach can't answer your call. Please try later. Thank you for calling... Where to”? Please turn right at the next light. Mr. Kamiya. Is Marcos here? No, he hasn't come. Is something wrong? He's not answering the phone. I'm so worried. It's late. I'll take you home. Dressed like that for work? Yes. You don't approve, do you? I won't judge you for what you do for a living. Just thought that it might invite trouble. Yes, it does. But I have lots of family. My brother wants to go to high school. Let me know when Marcos comes home. Yes. Thank you. What? We came here being told we'd be able to buy a house if we worked for 3 years. Marcos's dad was the leader. "The Japanese Dream,” he said and worked so hard, but no such dream existed. Then Lehman Brothers collapsed And Japanese companies fired Brazilians because of the recession. Brazilians were disposable. Are we parts of a machine? Marcos's dad apologized to everyone. And... He jumped from there. You resemble Marcos's dad, Mr. Kamiya. Your eyes and your beard. And your voice, too. Marcos likes you. Sorry I broke my promise. What happened? Erika was worried. I saw her earlier. I see. Please show me the flame you told us about. I'll help. Then put these on. Wait there. Put three in the center. In the center. One, two... three. Then four in the front. Fire will shoot out, so be careful. Good. Marcos. Wow. At the party... Manabu asked me if I have a dream. I didn't know what to say. Having dreams is a privilege. That's not true. But... You do have a dream, don't you? My dream is to make Erika and my family happy. Listen. See that fire from that hole and smoke? When they settle down, we put more logs in from the front. Yes. Let's move those logs over here. Here. Who is doing this to you? Members of a gang. Sorry to take up your time. No problem. Did something happen? I met a young Brazilian. He's in trouble with a gang. Here you go. Did that kid pick a fight with them? No, he just tried to help a friend but he's being tormented for it. I figured you'd know something. Know the Enomoto Group? The real estate, restaurants, sex trade and pachinko parlors in this city... They control most of those. The son of the CEO leads a gang. They're a pain in the ass. They're also connected to the mafia. The mafia sucks up to the gang. Unthinkable in the old days. Anyway, that no-good son hates Brazilians. Why? His wife and daughter got run over and killed. Who did it? Remember that accident where a bus ran into a row of preschoolers? Oh, yeah. A bunch of Brazilians who'd partied all night by the beach were on it. The driver was drunk. The driver was deported back to Brazil, and Kaito Enomoto pursued him. But when he found the driver after searching for a year, he was dead. Enomoto lost his target for revenge and Is still drifting about. Seiji! Seiji! - Seiji! - Seiji! Seiji! Turn on the TV! According to the news agency, an alleged armed group of rebels "Algeria - Attack by armed group Safety of Japanese employees unknown” has taken over a natural gas refinery plant in Algeria. It was being built by the major Japanese engineering company Futaba Plant... Manabu's company, right? Yeah. Their safety is unknown at this time. Futaba Plant Systems is working with the local embassy To quickly gather information. (Gather the hostages in one place and report back.) (We'll make our demands to the Algerian government then.) (Roger.) (Move.) (Get over here!) (Hurry up!) (Hands behind your back!) (Face forward! What are you doing?) I'm Nagai from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 17 Japanese nationals have been identified, including expatriates From Futaba Plant Systems' partner company. We're doing our best to rescue them in cooperation with other countries, So please try to stay calm and go on with your daily lives. What do you mean, stay calm? He's right, how do you expect us to stay calm? We'll let you know as soon as we have more information. So please stay calm in the meantime, is what I meant. Excuse me. There should be a woman named Nadia there, too. Please make sure she's safe, too. May I ask who she is? She's my son's wife. Japanese Workers Taken Hostage in Algeria” It's been three days, But our police department hasn't been informed. It's so frustrating. Seiji. You better eat. Force yourself if you have to. Takashi. Manabu said he wanted to quit his job and come home with his wife And become a potter. That's great. I told him not to. Why? You can't make a living making ceramics. He went to a good school, got a good job... His wife is a good, kind woman. I became too fascinated by this craft And couldn't protect Akiko. So when he told me he wanted to do pottery and live here with me... To be honest... I don't know how to interact with him. I get you. Because... We grew up without knowing what a family is. But you must have been glad to hear it. I'm not sure. You're still such a fool, Seiji. You have to trust Manabu. He'll come home. Yeah. You're right. (It's been five hours since we demanded our comrades be released.) (Kill three of the hostages like we promised.) (Roger.) (Fire!) You mentioned earlier that the group is a multinational terrorist organization. What exactly is their goal? What's your view, Mr. Inomata? According to local media reports, they demand the withdrawal of troops and release of comrades, But their true goal is ransom money. Holding hostages for money is a thriving business in North Africa. The terrorists have probably already demanded Ransom in exchange for the hostages from their respective countries. Japan is also faced with a difficult decision on how to respond. Our government needs to make quick decisions and negotiate appropriately. Also, when rescuing hostages with ransom... "Seiji Kamiya - Deed to Property” Mr. Kikuchi, please. Lend me 10 million yen by tomorrow. - That's impossible. - I'm begging you. His property is his life but he's willing to let go of it. Do him a favor. I understand, but we're not a charity. What's happening is terrible and I sympathize... Oh shut up and lend him the money. I know you've been cheating on your wife. - I'll tell everyone! - Setsuko! Who cares? Manabu's life is on the line! Kikuchi. Kikuchi. 10 million yen, Kikuchi! Seiji. Take this. My retirement bonus and... My savings. No, I can't accept this, Tetsuya, Setsuko. It's for Manabu. He's our family, too. Please. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Good luck. Prime Minister's Office Stop. You can't go in. My name is Kamiya. I'm the father of this here... Manabu Kamiya. Please let me in. Hey! Let me see someone who knows about the situation in Algeria. Please let me in. Please. 'Ministry of Foreign Affairs” Thank you for waiting. This is the Director of the Counter-Terrorism Division. Hello. My heart goes out to you... The kidnappers want money, right? Give this to them. There's about 20 million yen in here. Please save them. - Please calm down... - We sympathize, But we can't accept this. Why? Why can't you accept it? If you won't, let me see the Foreign Minister. If not the Foreign Minister, the Prime Minister. Please be reasonable. Please. Please. This... Is the only thing I can do now. Please get up. We're currently working diligently to resolve the situation. What do you mean by that? Money won't solve the problem. Then what should be done? Our government will not pay ransom. The international community Has agreed to not yield to demands from terrorists post 9/11. What about my son? Are you... Are you really going to save the hostages? Of course. Saving lives is our priority. Then use this! Mr. Kamiya, please. Give this to the kidnappers. Please calm down, Mr. Kamiya. Use this, please. Mr. Kamiya. Give this to the kidnappers. Please. Please. Lend us guns. We'll get it back. Nobody in this country asks a guy who lost trust once to do it again. Get a hold of exactly 5 million yen by the end of the month. Call this number when you're ready. If you fail to do so, we'll sell your organs. Erika will sell her body. Do you understand? Your race is so disgusting. Why are you alive? (Marcos!) (Forgive me.) (Why? What happened?) (I think it's over for us.) (I love you.) (I want to protect you, but...) (They must have Killed Manoel.) (Really?) (Jana called me several times. He hasn't been found.) (I could hear his daughter crying.) (We won't be able to escape.) (What do we do?) (Do we go somewhere far away?) (If I jump from there, will I be at peace?) (IT it's with you, I'll jump.) (No.) (I won't do what Dad did.) (What do we do, then?) What happened? A gang leader named Kaito forced them to sell drugs but the mafia robbed them. If Marcos and Rui don't bring them money, they'll be killed. They threatened Erika, too. I want to kill them. I want to kill them and break free. I want to help my buddies. Killing them won't free you. Then what should I do? We can't be Japanese. We're not Brazilian. What are we? - I'm sorry. - It's OK. But.. It's OK There's nothing we can do. They killed my childhood friend. Mr. Kamiya. Let's go to the police. No. They tried to sell drugs. They'll arrest and deport them. Hello? I'm Yoshimura of Futaba Plant Systems. Are you Manabu Kamiya's rather? Yes, I am. I hate to have to tell you this, but Manabu and his wife Nadia Were killed in Algeria. Moment of silence. Oh, honey. Dad. Excuse me. May I touch my son? An autopsy is scheduled after this. Please wait until the procedure is done. He came home at last... And you still want to cut him up? Excuse me. I'm Mizuno. I used to work with your son. Come in. Five days after being held hostage, we attempted to escape When the Algerian troops rushed in. Manabu... Was committed to saving the hostages until the very end. We made it out thanks to him. But Manabu and Nadia couldn't make it out on time, And got caught in the crossfire. I see. So he was helpful to everyone. That's good to know. Thank you for taking the time to come. Um... Here. It's the tablet Manabu used at work. There was a message for you in it. A message? Good-bye, then. Thank you for coming. Dad! Listen, Dad/ I've got good news! I'm gonna be a dad! Nadia is pregnant! Nadia, the baby... Let's all live together. Can't wait to see your happy race. Look. Isn't it beautiful? Hard to imagine this place was at war for a long time. We met in a faraway land, speak different languages and have different upbringings... But we'll be a family. The world is amazing! What can I say? I'm tearing up. Hey. Did you bring the money? Here's 700,000 yen. I'll work and pay back the rest. Please. Leave Marcos and Erika alone. Please. Join us for a drink? Sleep, sleep In your mother's bosom Sleep, sleep In your mother's arms "Akari Enomoto” Hello? A friend of ours drowned in the river. Yes. Please help us. (Rui!) (Rui!) (Rui, answer me!) (Rui!) (Rui, answer me!) (Marcos!) (Marcos, don't go!) (Let go.) (No!) (Don't go!) (We'll be next. I have to do something.) (If you go, they'll kill you. Don't go!) (Erika.) (Listen.) (Listen.)

Give Mika back. Give Akari back! If you can't, die and make up for it! Erika! Mr. Kamiya! How's Marcos? His heart stopped in the ambulance, And they resuscitated him. This way. Marcos. Recognize me? Mr. Kamiya... Don't talk. Don't die. You hear me? Don't die. So Kaito won't be arrested? Rui Murakami's case was deemed an accident Caused by playing in the river while drunk. Marcos had a knife, So Kaito can claim self-defense. He won't be arrested. Takashi. Do me a favor, will you? See you, Yusuke. Not that. Thank you, take care. Thank you. What the hell?
