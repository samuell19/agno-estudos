(ambient music) (female laughing) - [Voiceover] Hey, we're here. - Wow. - This is it. - Wow, it's gorgeous. I really hope the heating's on in there. - Let's see. - [Woman] I'm gonna grab the bags. - [Man] Okay. Let's see. Hey. Key, as promised. So far so good, huh? - Why is it again, that you couldn't write your second novel at a five star resort? - Because my love, we can't help who's around and might be swept away and rushing towards my brilliance. - So selfless, always looking out for others. - Indeed. - Whereas here, we're safe because we'll freeze solid before it hurts anyone. (kisses) - Couldn't do that in the doorway of a five star resort. - [Woman] Because you think you're mysterious. (laughing) - [Man] I just don't like to have other people around. Creeps me out. (woman giggling) Okay, let's see what we got. - Oh! Honey. Oh! - [Man] Oh, a mouse. - [Woman] That's a mouse. - [Man] It's alright. (Woman laughs) - We've seen a mouse. Keep us company, okay. I'm gonna go get the bags, huh? - Okay, I'll go find us a fireplace. - Hey. (speaks foreign language) (woman speaks foreign language) - I don't know what that means. - [Woman] Your French sucks. (laughing) (somber music) (door opening) - [Woman] Hey, this stupid log won't catch on fire. - Well it's a good thing the future of civilization isn't resting on you. - [Woman] Yeah, I'm more of the hunter-gatherer type. - Well, that's good to know if we get snowed in and food runs out. No, you gotta use the kindling, right? That's what it's there for. - [Woman] Oh, that's what it's there for. - What are you three? (woman giggles) - See. (kisses) (crickets) - This place is adorable. - So you admit it's a good idea to be here? (both laughing) Wow! - Tell me a poem. - [Man] Which one? (woman whispers) - Is it straight? - [Woman] Is it big enough? - Yeah. - [Woman] Yeah, it's perfect. - Good God. Woman, take a shower, you look like you got fucked last night, huh? - I feel like it. Hey, is the book as good as the poster? - That's what they tell me. - I'm gonna go shower. (kiss) - Oof, brush your teeth. (laughing) Oh, God. (dark ambient music) (sizzling) - Shit! Ryan! Hey, you left a pan full of something in the kitchen. It's all full of smoke. - Shit, I'm sorry. I just got lost for a bit. - Okay, why don't you go take a shower? I'll make us pancakes or something. - Yeah, sorry. - Okay. - Looks like I'm growing a beard. Forgot my shaving cream. - You're forgetting a lot of things these days. - I know, need to take some vitamin B or something. - Something. - Hey, what happened to pancakes? - That mouse chewed through the box and I do not think our mix was supposed to have chocolate chips in it. (laughing) - Well, this looks good. So what do you wanna do today? - Don't you need to write? - Well, you gotta ease into something like a novel. I hung a poster in my workroom, I think that's enough for the day. - Really? - [Man] Hey! - [Woman] A walk. That's what I wanna do today. A walk. - A walk? Really? Really? A walk? This is what you wanna do today? - [Woman] Come on, I wanna show you something. Do you see that? That's the sky. And there, over there, those are trees. You write about them. - Nope, all I see is a forest. - Come on, weirdo, I promise you won't melt. (light hearted folk music) * Between waterfalls of honey * You were wandering upside down * Leering at the friends you left behind * Trapped in that little town * Near the ocean, near the hillside * Near the factories and the bars * Where the people live so far apart * All stuck inside * Their cars * Where you were loved by a prince * With a love so intense * That he took his own life * In your honor * And in a different world * With a different face * It was I who could have been * Your lover * Morning brings light by the feet of the dawn * To light those tired eyes * Both crying out a warning * So please for tonight let me sleep in your arms * And if I die, let me die in the morning * Now I'm droning on forever * Singing songs about your mother * Drinking tea out in the garden * Where the flowers bloom forever * And she told you never, ever go alone * And where the sun has been unfaithful to the moon * - How's it going? - Terrible. Two paragraphs. - Honey, that's not bad. - Two this week. Hey, careful. - [Woman] Careful. Careful with F. Scott Fitzgerald's typewriter, your muse. - You are my muse. - Did you ever the story about when one of James Joyce's friends stopped by? - Was it so rare that there's an anecdote about the one time that it happened? - Shut up. - And I thought I was distant to people. - So James' friend comes by and says, "How's the writing going?" "Terribly!" cries James, "I've written seven words!" His friend says, "But James, that's very good for you." "I know!" wails James, "But I don't know what order they go in." - I don't know what the point of that story is. - That two paragraphs in a week is perfectly acceptable provided they are brilliant and in the right order. - Yeah. You still going into town today? - Yeah, I was planning on it. We're gonna need some mouse traps, unless we're gonna start hunting and gathering. - Would you pick that stuff up for me? - Yeah. Coenzyme q10, ginkgo biloba extract, B6, B12, are we gonna build an airplane from World War II? (man laughs) - I looked it up, that stuff's supposed to help with memory. - You looked it up, is it worrying you that much? - No, I've just been forgetting some things, and I think the writing would go easier if I could remember the character names. - Oh, are you forgetting your character names? - Hey, I'm just starting. I got time to learn the names. - Okay, well I'm gonna knock out a few more pages and then head out. - What are you translating? - A toaster over manual. - [Man] How's it going? (woman speaks foreign language) I don't know what that means. (sighs) - Ryan, I'm back! Ryan? Hey, there you are. Why didn't you say anything? - I'm a monster. - Come again? - I am a monster. - How so? - I used to walk through the forest and the ideas would just run up to me and flutter and frolic, begging to be taken. I was like a goddamn Disney princess, but now I run and hide and I can't find them and the harder I look, the further they run and the deeper they burrow. - I see. How drunk are you? So just crazy, huh? - Get drunk with me. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - Vice is a monster of so frightful mien. - (laughing) The world is so full of such a number of things. I am sure we should all be happy as kings. - Thanks, Mac. (kissing) Hey, at it already? - Hey! Don't you look better? I left your vitamins over there for you. - Oh, great. I am feeling good about this. These are gonna work. - Out of the pool then? - Out of the pool and feeling good. Whough! I'm gonna do that in two next time. (woman laughs) - I don't feel hungover at all. - Well that's good whisky for ya. And getting distracted from the drinking thing halfway through by the sex thing. I am gonna do some writing, that's all you. - No, honey half these bottles they say, take with food, an ulcer isn't going to help you. Honey? Hey. Thinking about making some soup, you want some? - Sure. - Okay. - Hey, we should have your family come out here for Thanksgiving. - You hate parties. Gatherings, and crowds. You don't seem all that fond of my family. - [Man] I am very pleasant with your family. - Yes, but I can tell when you are unhappy, and you are around my family. - Well, they're very loud. And it's not them, it's people in general. But, it'll be fine. Look, I wrote 23 pages this week, the novel is going well. You love your family and I love you. And besides, I don't want you to get sick of me, stuck alone out here with nobody else to entertain you. - You really want them to come? (dark ambient music) - I really want you to be happy with your mom and... - [Woman] Alix. - [Man] Alix. - Honey, take some more vitamins or something. - Why don't we invite your mom out for Thanksgiving as well? - You know she won't come. - She might if we ask. - [Man] So is your family coming? - Who says I called them already? - I know you called them the second you left the room. - (woman laughs) I did. Mom was at Bible study, but I talked to Alix and she is very excited to have Thanksgiving dinner with famous Novelist Ryan Cole. - Oh, great. Well, this will be fun. - Just suffer through it, they like you. And I like you. - How much do you like me? - Nuh uh. (laughing) Earn it, write five more pages. Oh Mom, it's so peaceful here. Yeah, every time the wind blows, the leaves they just shower down. You're gonna love it. And Ryan has this great office, it's looking over a beautiful little pond. I think he's feeling better. I mean, he's in there working away. (glass breaking) (Ryan shouting) Mom, I have to go. Ryan? Ryan. Hey. (Ryan breathing heavily) - Hey, what happened? Shit. Let's get you cleaned up. Where are those bandages? I'll go check the bathroom. Hey, baby. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry I scared you. I was in the pool. And I couldn't get out. - See what a piece of eggshell I have found you. (telephone busy tone) (door knocking) (tense music) - [Sheriff] Good morning, Sir. Is there a miss Katherine Cole present here? - Yeah. - I need to speak with her immediately, please. - Um... okay, come in. Uh, just hang on. - Hi, officer. - Are you Katherine Cole? - Yes, what's wrong? - I'm officer Hallerin. Is there someplace where we can speak? - Um... yeah, out back. (telephone busy tone) What's wrong? - [Sheriff] Are you alright, ma'am? - Yes, I'm fine. - What happened to your finger? - I cut it. Cleaning up some broken glass. - Is everything okay out here? - Go back inside, sir. I need to speak with your wife privately. - What is this about, please? - We received a call from an... Anthea Tate indicating that she had been unable to reach you after hearing a disturbance over the phone? - Oh, yes that's my mother. Sir, I was on the phone last night, and then I heard my husband knock over a poster frame, so I went inside to help him and then that's then I cut my finger on a piece of glass and then the phone must have been busy. My poor mother. - Are you sure you're alright, ma'am? - Yes, I'm fine. My husband wouldn't, he would never hurt me. We don't have coffee out here, but do you want some tea? - I'm alright, ma'am, just doing my job. You have a good day, and please call us if you ever do have a problem. - [Kate] Thank you, sir. - Call your mother. (calm ambient music) - Hey. We're fine. - Really? - Really. - [Ryan] I... - [Kate] I know. - [Ryan] I'm sorry, babe. Okay. I'm gonna go and do some work. - [Kate] Hey, babe. - Hey. - What ya doin'? - [Ryan] I forgot to drink my tea and it got cold. What are you doing? - (laughing) Making hand turkeys. - Weird. How's the red badge of courage? - It's feeling good. (kiss) - Hey, let's go for a walk or something. I'm getting fuck-all done lately. (Kate laughing) - It must be bad if you actually wanna go outside. Grab a bottle of wine, we'll go drink it somewhere. (Ryan moans and kisses) (Kate laughing) (tranquil folk music) * Wind swept through August * Caught a malaise * Killed off the hours * With pills and champagne * Oh but I laze through the days * Just the same * To store my strength * For courage in this new dark age * Stared down the freezer * And cleared out my phone * Wheeled through the aisles * And brought nothing home * Oh I could call you (light ambient music) - This is beautiful. - We don't have to worry about chilling the wine. (giggles) - Come here. (kissing) (sighs) It is sexy how good you are at opening alcohol. (Kate laughing) Kate... what are you doin'? - I'm trying to warm up. - Oh, wow. Does that help? - Mm-hm, that's too warm. Can we just take our clothes off right here? - Oh, I think it's a little cold for that. Here, drink some wine. That'll cool you off. (Kate giggles) - These are the good times, aren't they? - I'm afraid so. - Why afraid? - If these are the good times, what have we got to look forward to? - Being together in 40 years and looking back on this. - Yeah. There is that. - What are you doin'? Oh, Mr. Writer, always with a pen. (giggling) - Hey, you're getting all skittish. - It tickles. (giggling) What are you doing? - I'm gonna put this note in this bottle... and I'm gonna throw it out in the water so that no matter what, we'll be out there in the world. - Until somebody finds it and thinks they have a secret admirer. - Better? Done? - Honey. - Ah, head rush. - (laughing) Okay. - You ready? There you go. It's out there. Let's go. Wait, hang on. Think I can hit the pine cone? - (laughing) Not in a million years. - (groans) Alright, double or nothing. Huh? (Kate giggles) (Kate gasps) (dark ambient music) Shit. (laughing) Oh my God. - Honey, it was an accident. - You know what, everything I do, it turns to shit. I can't even throw a rock without killing a bird. Just like I am killing my fucking novel. - I thought the writing was going well? - I know you did. I loved it, and I stroked it, and I petted it to death. 130 pages into what should be a 300 page novel, and it is over! - So your follow-up is a brilliant novella, what's wrong with that? - It's, people will think that is a failure. That's not what they expect. - Fuck 'em! If you've said what you've gotta say then publish it like it is. - Oh, God. (sighs) Yeah, you're right. You're right. Yeah, you're right. You're right. - Alright. - I'll keep going. - Alright, let's bury Horace and get you back to your epic novel. - You named him? - Of course. Come on. I hope they don't get lost. (laughing) That it? - [Ryan] Yep. - [Kate] Okay. (door closing) Oh, there they are! Okay, and don't mention that Mom called the cops. She was really embarrassed. (muffled screaming) Oh, you look so beautiful! - [Woman] Oh, you look beautiful. - [Kate] Thank you so much for coming. Here we are! - Look at this, it's beautiful in here! It's a lovely cabin. - Thanks, Mom. - Oh, it's great. - And there's Ryan. - Hello Ryan! Come over here and give us a hug. (laughing) Hi, sweetie. How are ya? - Hey, Ryan. - [Ryan] Hey, Alix. - [Alix] How are you? - So, I need to get this in the fridge. - Oh, of course, let me give you a whole tour! - [Anthea] Okay, perfect. - Gosh, I love this cabin. (giggles) This place is so cool. It's really neat you guys get to stay here for so long. - Yeah, yeah it's pretty nice. - Anyway, I baked this pie. Where should I put it? - I'd probably ask your sister about that. - Kate! Where do you want the pie to go? - [Kate] Alix, come up here! - Ah. (Ryan sighs) - So is that an apple pie? Just plain apple pie? - [Alix] Yeah, it's the apple crisp from the, what is that whole, the southern -- - [Kate] Is it grandma's? - Is that grandma's? (laughing) - [Kate] I think it is! (talking over each other) (dark ambient music) - It's one of my favorites, too. It's so easy, it's so easy. - I made it like three weeks ago, but I didn't put enough -- - And look at all those, do you have any ice cream? - We do, we do have ice cream down in the basement. (conversation drowned out by music) (door knocking) - Hey, Ryan. Can I come in? - Sure. - Uh, so, my teacher asked if I could get you to sign that. - Huh. First edition. - [Alix] How can you tell? - The number line there starts with a one. - So Mom and Kate can be a lot to handle when they haven't seen each other for a while. - Oh, they're fine. I just don't know what to do with their invisible gifts. - You and Kate are perfect for each other. - Name? - It's Alix. Mom said you were forgetting things, but -- - The name of your teacher. - Shit. I wasn't supposed to say anything. Please don't tell Mom and Kate that, they'd be so mad. - What does she say? - [Alix] Mom? - Kate. - I just heard from Mom that she was worried. That's all. - Name? - Uh, Mr. Marino. John Marino, I think? - Hm. And um, (clears throat) he teaches literature? - Yep. - Well, this better get you an A. - Right there with ya. (dark ambient music) Hey John, keep molding the young minds. Perfect. - Simple but specific. - The stuff in this book, are your parents really -- - Happy, sad, fuckin' monsters under the bed? - Yeah. - It's sort of an acid trip version of real events. - [Alix] Huh. - Didn't you promise Kate you wouldn't read it? - I did but my teacher assigned it so I had to. Sorry. - Yeah, just um... don't tell her about it, okay? - I won't, I won't. But I don't understand why you don't want her to know. - I worked very hard trying to get that stuff out of my head and locking it in that book. I wasn't very happy before I knew your sister, and I want her to know this me. Not this one. - Must be scary up there. - Hey, come on you two, no more hiding. We're gonna play a game. - Once more into the breach, dear Brutus. - You are so weird. Thanks. - [Kate] Goodnight! (chuckles) That's still not full? - Can only take so much air in my lungs at a time. - Really? I thought you were full of hot air? - You know, you won't be laughing when I pass out and you've gotta finish this yourself. (Kate laughing) You know, Alix mentioned my, um... forgetting things. - Shit, I'm sorry honey. When I'm worried about something, I talk it out with my mom. I know you don't, but -- - It's fine. I'm sure that's the... normal thing. Mm! (Kate giggles) - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Oh I'm fine, and you? (Kate giggles) - Seriously though, how are you? - Please. Do not try to have a serious conversation with me on top of a giant marshmallow. (Kate giggles) Thank you very much. Hey! Are you serious? - [Kate] Mm-hm. - You wanna do it, now? - Mm-hm. - Fuck it. (Kate giggles) God, I feel like I'm having a three way with you and a blowup doll. (Kate laughing) (both moaning) - Oh no, honey, what happened? - [Ryan] I think we sunk the raft. - Oh, fucking raft! - [Ryan] Oh, wow. You got a dirty mouth, sailor. - [Kate] Yeah, I gotta get it out now, I can't swear in front of Mom. (Ryan groans) I'm going to shower. (dark ambient music) - [Kate] Go shower. - Sorry, I'm still asleep. - [Kate] You won't be after the coldest shower ever. - Early bird gets the worm! - [Kate] Oh, mom! - That was a good one! (talking over each other) - Cold. - [Kate] Hey there! - Ryan, would you put these potatoes on the table please? - Sure. - Thank you. Perfect. (talking over each other) - [Kate] Oh, the cranberries look delicious. - I'm so hungry. (Kate laughing) - Piping. - [Ryan] Wow. Beautiful. - Ryan, would you like to do the honors? - Uh, no. No no no, please feel free. - Okay, so let's hold hands. Say blessing for this Thanksgiving. (tense ambient music) Dear Lord, thank you for the bounty that you place before us. With the blessings and successes we've had over this past year. Thank you for our family, and our ability to be here together. I'll remember those who have gone before us and are with you now. On this day of thanks, in your son's name. Amen. - [Kate and Alix] Amen! (women laughing) - Honey, you want some yams? - Uh, yes. Please. Oh God, not again. - Please don't take the Lord's name in vain! And yes, again. And every year in the future until the two of you are no longer undefeated. You won last year, so we get to go first. Alix, you draw first. - How about we switch teams, yeah? - [Anthea] No, you're on my team and you will show no mercy, young lady! - (groans) Okay! Fine, watch out. Right, let's see. - Song, sing sing sing. - Heart, love. - Love! - Song, melody? (Kate laughing) Music? - Hour glass! Love in clock, love in time, love in, time? Oh, you're gonna love this one. (Anthea and Kate laughing) - Sum. Finger. America. Pennies for heaven! - Oh! (laughing) Music, sing. (laughing) - Um, waves? Ocean, water. - Love in the Time of Cholera! - [Alix and Anthea] No way! - Boat. Ship. Watership Down. - Woo. - The author, the... of... author of Watership Down. - Yes! - Oh, God. Author of Watership Down! Wait, no no, stop stop stop writing. No no, I got it, I got it, I got it. It's fine! God. Damnit. Jesus fuck! (smashing) (Anthea and Alix screaming) - Kate wait. I'll go. - [Kate] Mom, you don't. - I may have raised two girls, but I know when a boy needs a mother. (dark ambient music) - Mrs. Tate. - I think it's time you start calling me Anthea, Ryan. - Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry... I'm sorry about that and, I'm sorry that I swore. - That's not why I'm here. Are you alright? - I don't know. - [Anthea] What is it? (Ryan sighs) It's like I can feel my mind... slipping away and... I keep grabbing at them but, it just keeps falling through my fingers. And I'm afraid that one day... it will just trickle off and be gone. - Have you tried prayer? - I'm glad that your faith sustains you, Anthea, but it does not me. (speaks foreign language) - I know you don't believe, but I do. May I pray for you? - Do your worst. - Dear God, please be here with Ryan during his time of trouble. Please, heal his mind, and keep him safe from what's happening. In your precious son's name. - Hey. - Bed time, everyone. We're gonna leave in the morning. - [Kate] Mom, no. - [Alix] What? - [Anthea] Yeah we are, Kate. Ryan likes it quiet, you know he does. And he just needs to spend some time alone with you. And I want you to enjoy it as long as you can. And Kate, you need to get him some help. And if he won't go see someone, you bring someone here. He said something to me in German. - It's Rilke, that's the only German he knows. "Would not these then throw their last, ever-hoarded, "ever-hidden, unknown to us, "eternally valid coins of happiness "before that pair with the finally genuine smile?" Ryan. Time for bed. (kissing) (Ryan sighing) - You look better this morning. - Thank you, Anthea. - [Anthea] Don't thank me, thank -- - No, thank you for trying. - Well... I'm gonna pray for you, Ryan. - Don't pray for me. Just pray for Kate. - Take care of yourself, Ryan. - Bye, Ryan. - Bye, Alix. - [Alix] Love you. - [Kate] Love you too. (distant chatter) (door closing) - (sighs) I'm sorry. - Come on. Let's have second breakfast. (warm piano music) What's wrong? - [Ryan] How do I make tea? - Bitter. You steep it too long. With a tea bowl. - Tea bowl. That's the ticket. You want any? - At this hour? Isn't it gonna keep you up all night? - Mm, pretty sure I destroyed my body's reaction to caffeine during the first book. Oi... we gotta set those traps. - So why isn't the writing going well? - It just isn't. Remember when I told you, after you finish some really great writing... it's like you just come. Sweaty, shaking like you need a cigarette. - Are you cheating on me with your writing? - (laughing) Easy, Zelda. - Are you complaining about writing or trying to get sex? - Just complaining. Hm. Well. Back to it. (dissonant piano music) (gasps) (mutters) (gasps) (groaning) - Hey, hey. Ryan, it's okay. It's okay. Hey. Ryan. - Jesus. Why is it so cold in here? - Because you left the window open. Come on, take a break. I'll make some tea. (Ryan breathes heavily) Here. You must be freezing! - [Ryan] Yeah. - Honey, do you wanna see somebody about this memory thing? - I'm fine. I promise. It's just a little stuffy in there, so I grabbed the window and then I got lost in the writing. - Okay. - I'm gonna try to just, keep it going. - (breathing heavily) Thanks. Thanks for the tea. - Is it going well? - Just reworking what I'm, what I've got. - Keep the window closed. (Ryan groaning and breathing heavily) - Shh. Shh. (car engine) - Who's that? - [Kate] Probably Doctor Taylor. - What's he doing out here? - He's gonna make sure you're okay. - God damnit. - Well, that was mature. (dark ambient music) (door creaking) Ryan. Please do this for me. - I don't know if I can. - If you can't get out of the pool yourself, please take the rope I'm throwing you. - We are beyond the pool, Kate. And before me lie nothing but eternal things. (sighs) (door creaking) - Hi. - [Ryan] He's ready for you. - For me? - [Ryan] He wants to talk to you. - Okay. (dark ambient music) Hi there. - Hey. - [Kate] Do you want some tea, or a cookie? I made cookies. (giggles) - I'm fine. - [Kate] Are you sure? - [Dr. Taylor] Yeah. - [Kate] Thank you so much, again, for coming all the way out here. - Oh, it's my pleasure. It's a beautiful drive. So, Kate. So, Kate. It's never when people are as young as Ryan. Based on his family history and what he's told me, it sounds like he has something called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. - What is that? - It's a extremely rare disease. And it's caused by a build up of abnormal prions in the brain. Prions are little protein cells, and they infect the normal, non-diseased prions and they eventually kill the nerves in the brain. Now... unfortunately... there is no cure for this. - So what comes next, what's the treatment? - Kate. There is none. - But it could, I mean, it's probably something else, right? 'Cause he's, I mean he's fine, he's -- - Kate, the combination of symptoms that he described to me... is only present in this spectrum of prion diseases. The loss of memory, loss of balance, the behavioral shifts, coupled with his family history. - What do you mean, "his family history"? - This is hereditary, his father had this disease. - His father died in a car accident. - His father died of this. - Did Ryan know he might get this and lie to me? Kate, Kate, Kate. Would you have lived your life any differently? Would you have done anything different? From where you are right here looking back, the alternative would have been knowing sooner that this could happen. It was just a chance back then, would it have been better to know that this could be coming? I tried. I tried for years to get Ryan to get tested and he wouldn't do it. He didn't wanna do it, he wanted to live life just not knowing. - What can I do, I mean, what can we, where do we go? What do we do next? - All I can tell you is how it progresses from here and what to expect. - [Kate] Okay. - It's very aggressive, very fast acting. Generally takes about three months from the onset of the initial symptoms. Okay? You'll see his memory continue to go. His motor skills will... deteriorate. Kate, I'm not gonna lie to you, it's not gonna be easy. You got a tough road. At some point you'll need professional care. But I will be here, for you. - Do you think we should take him to a hospital? - Right now, even the most advanced treatment that we have would add, maybe a week. Two at best. Okay? And, he'd have to be at the hospital most of the time which would take away from your time together, so, I don't recommend that. - Do you think we should stay here? - You should talk to Ryan. (door creaking) (dark ambient music) (crickets) (Kate sobbing) - Mom? Hi. (sobbing) Ryan's sick. (sobbing) We're gonna stay here as long as we can. I'm okay. I love you too. I will. (sobbing) (smashing) Have you eaten since lunch? - I don't know. - You haven't, eat this. - Hey, when I can't work on this anymore, I want you to send it to Jackson. He's expecting it. - Is he excited? - No. He's pissed it's not longer. But... I didn't tell him about anything else, so... hopefully this will be enough to keep you filthy rich your whole long life. - I can take care of myself. Eat your sandwich. - Oh. (snickers) (melancholic music) - Look at you in your PJs! (giggles) - It was cold last night. You seemed comfy. - You are supposed to snuggle with me if it's cold. - That seems like a wonderful idea. (Kate giggles) - [Kate] You're all fuzzy. (giggles) (gasps) Whoa. We caught a mouse! - You set the traps? - I can't do it! (melancholic music) - No, keep reading. (kiss) I remember this. - I remember, what? - Sitting like this on the park bench in front of your dorm. - Right after I hooked with you because I liked your story in the let journal. - Is that why it was so easy to get you into bed? - (laughing) What do you mean, "easy"? - What? It was the first night we met. I didn't even have to buy you a drink. - The drinks were free, it was a party. But I didn't make it that hard for you. - And the next day, we were sitting like this, on that park bench. Both reading with your head on my lap. - Just because I was slutty, apparently. - I thought it was because I was brilliant. Hm? (Kate chuckling) (Kate panting and gasping) (dark ambient music) (heavy breathing) - Hey! - Hey, you gotta send it to Jackson. For me. Please, just send it to him, right now, the story. 'Cause I cannot trust myself not to change it and it is the best that I can make it. - Okay, like "right now", now? - Please, just send him an e-mail. A PDF. Never trust an agent. (dissonant piano music) - Having fun? Ryan? (breathing heavily) (thud) Oh my, what happened? (Ryan groaning) Are you okay? - [Ryan] I just got dizzy. Fell over. - [Kate] Okay. Let's get you back to bed. There you go. Hold on to me, okay? Got me? Hey. Good morning. I made breakfast. Do you need to go to the bathroom? Do you need help? - No. - Okay. - [Ryan] Kate! Kate! - Hey honey, what's wrong? - There's a PDF on my desktop. Did you send my story to somebody? - I sent it to Jackson like you asked. - Why did you do that? I didn't ask you to do that. It isn't finished! I mean, how can it be finished at 103 pages? - Sweetheart, you asked me to send it. - No, I did not ask you! You ruined it! You ruined everything! (telephone busy tone) (Kate breathing deeply) - Hi. Come here. There you go. Yeah. There. Put this on. Once there was a knight, named Tristan. He was the strongest and bravest of knights, and was sworn to a king. One day, it came to pass that he was sent to a far off land, and he won the heart of a beautiful princess named Isolde for his king. On the journey home however, they drank a potion that bound their hearts and souls together forever. They were desperately in love but could never truly be together. Until they died. And two trees grew out of their graves so entwined, they could never be separated. (footsteps) - Hello, Kate. Ryan, are you ready? * I break * Where you bend * I take what you send * And we both * Pretend * That I start * Where you end * When I say * You know * When I fall * You go * And I row this boat * Too fast * Too slow * I've got one way * And you've got * One way * And I break * Where you bend * I take what you send * We both pretend * But I know that I start * Where you end * Where you end * Where you end * Where you end * Where you end * Where you end (birds chirping) (dark electronic music)
