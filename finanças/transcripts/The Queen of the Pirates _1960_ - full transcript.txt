Was resisted my guards and I defied authority. I see that there's a young awaiting punishment. - Convict's daughter. - I understand. November Venetians, we are superstitious... A execution is not good news for our first meeting. I agree with Count of Santa Croce. An act of clemency is the best that we can receiving her offer. - Ricco Captain! - Sweet ! Drive convict in a cell, give them life. He will serve his sentence working in me. I think it's appropriate to shield and a young girl from an uncomfortable position. Do not you think?

There were...? Could not you present yourself in a manner brighter. A lady can appreciate chivalrous impulses. Thank you. I take a great weight off my mind. Count 's funny. What happens to the girl?

I and Count against a wall, his wounds every few strokes of sword... - How? By two at once? - You do not believe me ? I believe. But then what happened? We had reached the limits of our forces, when suddenly... ... Behind us, opens a gate. Walked in a close... ... When we returned, we found ourselves in front of two women magnificent. Two ladies who fell in love with me and my master. - And then...? - You can not tell a girl. You want to know how the story ended? This is the life! - Who is it? What do you want at this hour? - Open, Luke. I am, Mirko. - I sat and waited for boarding their hidden. - Are you sure ? - As I see, Captain. - It niece innkeeper. Where will they go?

A small territory and peace. Between power and naval power of the Ottoman Empire to the Republic of Venice. As you see, dear count, situation is hardly rosy. If a potential war between these powers... ... My dukedom will be swallowed immediately. You can ask alliance with the Venetian Republic... Requesting a trade agreement. I hope something better. A real alliance based on blood relation . Do hinted at a possible marriage between me and your daughter Friend... ... It's always so disoriented in achieving the core problem? Why a longer, Duke? When our mutual friend, handed me your invitation... ... There were certainly reasons. I prefer to treat the subject with honesty. I know your past full of adventures. - Duke... - Do not interrupt me. I'm not concerned about the past, I want to know two things about today... Feelings they cherish for Isabela... True value of your property. Regarding your daughter let you imagine my feelings... As for my heritage... You refer to properties and all? Course! - First you need to calculate... - You were... Finally, I have found. I have looked everywhere, Cesare. - I'm disappointed. - Dad, let me count kidnap him. I wish him and the other ladies judge as a sentimental issue. Go! We will resume the discussion once. Duke! You're fit! You're better than the drunk who defected. What is your name ? Danillo. - For the first time on my ship? - Yes, sir. I think I've seen... Perhaps through a port, sail years. - Crew Chief! - Order, Captain. Go downstairs and get us on the deck a beautiful girl. A put to prepare a good lunch. To be one flesh. I want my people to remain impressed. Chef! Bring wine for all. I knew we would sell the Turks. I'd rather kill myself... My father is here. I got a note from him. My comrades are part of the crew. How did you get my message? Was the bread. Crew is with us? Are you sure? If it were not mercenaries, sailors would have lain on the seabed. I'll take care of mercenaries. The wine has drug them out of combat. I'd give them a good wine sailors. That's for Yusuf. Will snore when we serve the main course. Keep it ready. As soon as you hear screams, stand on deck. Now turn the hideout. Listen to me! One of you can come on deck and eat well. One moment. I want one that's willing to entertain the crew . What is it? Have you swallowed your tongue? I have to choose this voluntary? Sailor, I come from. Make way, shameful! Men do not scare me. Come. Are you the type of woman we need. Hai, gorgeous! Come here! Or maybe you afraid? Look what we goodies. What happened to him? Not seen a beautiful woman? Take them wine to drink my health. Do not drink! Be prepared! Come, come closer! Come on! At each stage undress something. Drink, Captain! So! Bravo. Go! Want to eat or not? Come! Come on! Do not play dumb. - I'll help you. - Pig! I told you I'd kill you. We are free. - Victory. - Ship is ours. Where disembark? In a port on the coast or to take refuge in Venice. Let's be persecuted again? No, never. - Do we headed to the island of pirates. - To the island of pirates. It's nice to hear your stories Even if there are doubts that are invented. - What? - Bad news, Duke. Fishermen have fished the bodies of Yusuf and mercenaries. - A shipwreck? - Were killed. - And Isabela? - Not a trace. Has vanished. If opera Albanian will hang in the market. - Who is it? - A pirate. So far there has attacked our ships . Luck. Hai, gorgeous! Kiss me! Beast! How dare you? That's why I like you. You're a real woman! - Agrees with us, Albanezule? - What you mean ? Joining her on Isabela your ships, fleet Duke attack and liberate people. I think not, Captain Mirko. Do you know why doing well on this island? Because I did not attack her or me. It's kind of tacit understanding. Not interested people persecuted? Do not you thirsty for justice? ... Justice! I heard this word. It does not mean anything. To its own people as I can handle myself. Our ship 's better armed and gives us the right to make decisions. If you were a man, I'd challenged to a sword. Sword has no sex! Come! Come and have some fun. - If a scratch, kill him! - It's my turn. It would be a shame to dirty this beautiful body. - But I'll give you a lesson. - Try. Not bad...! Get your sword, if you want to go. I get. You are brave. I forgot that women are worse than the devil! - Teaching me that kick. - I'll do what you say. Bravo, Sandra! But you Jeanna, you'll console after this loss? Prepare the ships, my dogs! Was finished with work. Today, the island has a pirate queen. Hooray! No more excuses. I'm full. Captains my fight with that cursed pirate queen... What will become of my duchy?! Our ships can not compare with their ship Admiral . I know very well. Pride Isabela was my fleet! From now on, you will not sail isolated. Each captain will answer headed for ship. Go! - Duke...! - Get out! Please, Dad. Calm down! Excuse me, Isabela, I ruined the happiest day of your life. But I could not help myself. I would like to know who is the woman who leads them. - I have an idea, Dad. - Explain yourself better. Do you remember Sandra, daughter rebel who wanted to hang him? Ship was on Isabela. There were 30 women on the boat those, why just her? I do not know. A feeling. Feminine intuition. Call it what you want... Sir Count, at a time make me worry. You should stop thinking in those woman. Today's celebration... Tonight will be announced engagement have secured future. Do you know the legend of Esau who betrayed for a plate of lentils? - This is not about lentils. - Right. It's betraying the principles and my feelings! Stories. I came here with a purpose set. We must fulfill it... Or not... Friends noble and friend... I have the honor to announce the engagement my daughter, Isabela... ... The Count of Santa Croce. What a pleasant surprise, my dear! - When marriage, Duke? - As soon as possible. As soon as he escaped the pirate miserable ... And those who follow. A week ago, an important transport of the Levant... Fell into their hands. Our maritime routes are paralyzed. A friend of mine in Venice was the victim of an attack! Calm down, gentlemen! We ordered our ships to sail in the group. - What are you, Cesare? - I'm having fun listening... On behalf of our captains duchy, I assure you... ... It's a matter of days until we catch Pirate Queen. - For months, perhaps years...! - What do you mean, Count? I think it's a ghost ship, if a woman... ... Manages to keep in check some captains so valuable. Duke, protest on behalf of all our sailors. Calm down, Captain! Count likes jokes. The captain has the right to protest, and I clarify my position. I had no intention to offend anyone , Captain. Say that where can not succeed otherwise intelligent force can take over. It's an interesting principle. But as applied in practice? How can it be applied in this case? I have a plan... ... But it takes guts, ingenuity and speed . Three qualities that are difficult to find in one person. Only if the person is not called Cesare of Santa Croce. Explain to us your plan Can Count wants to do alone. Shut up, Ricco! I accept your challenge, Captain. So speaks a man! - What will they do? - You're kidding? I have no doubt of your courage, Mr. Earl. Unable to life-threatening and to risk my ships. I can handle alone, ask only 10 days and complete freedom of action. Capturing Pirate Queen will be my wedding present. With your permission. I love brave men... Isabela... - It's extraordinary... - risked much acting alone. Do you think he will succeed? Cesare! Please do not take this decision . I can not. Do it for me. We presentiment that this action will bring us bad luck. My dear, you can not ask me to deny my word Gentleman . - You had to stay at the castle. -'ll Die drowned. What man...! This time we lose feathers! Now all. I was born to noble and Vanessa Porto -... I will die like an idiot! - An epitaph managed. There was a foolish act, I promised a wedding... ... When Duke will find out that I have no property. How are we doing? Three days looking for a Pirate Queen... - I do not see... - Pirate Island is not far. Gonna die... I help myself. A wooden sailboat...! Let's hope they are pirates. What luck I think are sailors honest... ... I realized perfiditatea Duke and his obvious intent... ... To deal with the Ottoman Empire to the detriment of Venice... ... I ran to warn the Doge. Unfortunately, our ship wrecked. I went adrift with no hope, and then I met. How do you run away from me? I was there. Duke lied to us when said that he would grace my father... ... And ordered his soldiers to kill him. And I, along with other women... Slave market... I got the Levant. But Duke will pay dearly, all its ships be attacked. Our flag that makes him tremble. Count of Santa Croce needs rest. Yes, I'm tired. You're finished, my friend. Do we give a walk, and tomorrow will be shaped. No doubt. Anyway, thank you! Sorry to discard your cabin It's little I can do for you My dad and I owe you a lot. Now we're even. There are debts that can not be deleted. - Look! Sandra in women's clothes. - You're not dreaming... what happens? We decided to choose one of us... You can not deny. Duke and his daughter are ruthless. And he told me... What do we do? Renounce marriage? - The good life, the abundant life... - you think I'll be better than. You should take the shots. Phew, what a fool I am! Even a magnified. I have had land and house, but here I am in the middle pirates! If they hang me, I will hang later Duke. Sir Count, for once to mention peer. I am cynical, but you're the pirate on after that... I do not want excuses. You want to know the novelty? Resign. How? Now with sentimentality, years spent together... Resigning. Go back to the castle and marry the cook. You still awake at this hour? Often come here at night. Between sky and sea... I feel... I feel peace with the world and myself. What's eating you? Thankless fate of my people I want to be free and happy. Wickedness which it uses power to oppress... This is my destiny. A destiny... particularly like courage and your beauty. When you get to the castle and you saved my father ... I was desperate... You are kind and generous... Maybe not as you imagine. I could not see you otherwise. Me so I always imagined. I know. It was under the pillow of your cabin. What are you doing here? Go to bed! If you knew how I expected moment... Morning we reach the Italian coast and you can disembark, Mr. Earl. Mirko No, go back to ducat. - And if you catch Duke. - I will do anything. Gotcha. I resorted to a stratagem for nab your ship. I wanted to capture single Pirate Queen. - How could you? I... - I never knew you. Do not know the infamy committed by Duke until you told me. Now I know I fight for a just cause. I will be with you and help you. Helmsman! Change course! No one knows this passage. I dug a tunnel to reach the castle. Come! We understand Mirko. 2 Tomorrow night I will wait here. I consider castle and we can we go out plan. I want to talk alone. - Go ahead. - Tunnel there. What happens? A really love Sandra? Forgive my question, I have a right to know. I love. This love made me I found myself. For Sandra, want to fight with us? Not only for her. I do not like bullies. When you have more reason than ours founded. Sandra legal heir to the dukedom Dorutza. - How your daughter...? - It's not my daughter. 20 years ago, I was a soldier with conscience in the service Duke... - That's why you hang? - No, I recognized you. A man changed much over the years. Zulian was just an ambitious young master, Duchess of Dorutza cousin. She was widowed, she was left conquered by Zulian and was married to him. From this marriage, was born a girl, Isabella. - And Sandra? - She was the first born. She had to inherit the dukedom, and Duke instructed me to kill her. And you accepted? I took the child in his arms to throw into the sea. In that moment, he put little little hands around my neck and kissed me. I treated her like my daughter, hiding the truth... I want to remain our secret. Sandra I would not like to feel unhappy. Do not worry, I will not talk. If one day, they may take place, I do not mind it a miss... I told the truth and my sins will be forgiven. - I'm sure you will not lose. - Thank you. Here, Enrico, this is an edict requisition. - Acts without restraint. - Without a doubt. Okay. You must not have mercy. Count of Santa Croce was returned. Finally.... I was worried... This is the most beautiful return I received ever.... - Duke...! - Sit down. Well, Mr. Earl.... Where's wedding gift? In the midst of the sea leads. - I knew you fail... - I do not understand. I mean Pirate Queen ship is at sea. I sat on her ship two days and I gained confidence. How? You arouse jealousy. There's no reason, Isabela. It is a woman endowed with soul force, that makes women Queen... ... Not her beauty... Weird! I imagine it beautiful... ... With brown hair and green eyes. What are your plans? How do you catch? This is my secret. Remember our deal. Freedom of movement for 10 days. - I have four. - Right. With your permission, retire. Good night. What do you think, Dad? Perhaps will succeed, is a man full of surprises... That's not what I meant... Felt in his voice a note of falsity... - The suspect...? - Nothing specific. But I'm not convinced by the way I described it. 'd Better keep an eye on it... with discreetly, of course. Mr Conte: I want to know something. I want to ask you a question, one low, low... Tell! But fast! Mind when you are with Sandra or you are with Isabela? What do you think? I do not understand anything of it I allowed to ask. - You think you're my counselor? - I would not never allow. But do all the time... And I agree with you... ... I swear that from now on, I will follow your advice. - Really? - A Knight of Santa Croce never lies. Or... almost never... - Tell me what should I do? - Married yourself with the Duchess Isabela. The Duchess legitimate! You have my word as a gentleman. What are you doing here? Why not come Mirko? - I wanted to see you. - Listen carefully, Sandra. The attack will take place tomorrow evening. I will try to get rid of the guards at the entrance... When you see three torches to reach the walls with all his people... I do not want, it's too risky. If something happens... I'm not going to happen... You're under arrest! It's Pirate Queen. I promise. You traitor! Miserable! You betrayed me... Let me... My congratulations! I did not need your help, little while I brought her to the castle... Captain Ricco, count won the bet. Congratulations. We go ? I managed to run away, but my master's supervised . What they want to do with Sandra? Three days will hang in the castle courtyard. Gather the people immediately. If you will touch a single strand of hair I will devastate all the duchy. Just three days... Tell the count that we attack at sea and on land. Send couriers in every village, people waiting to be released. We will destroy that nest of vipers... - We'll save. - Only if we get the time... Raise the flag! Prepare guns. Dust and wicks to be prepared...! Get ready to attack... Lower the sails... Death to the tyrant! Let's go to the castle... Everyone... Before the castle. ... Attack and land... -... If they manage to mobilize the population. - It's not easy, we do not have much time. Already prepared the gallows. Here's our guest... All these gentlemen want to express our gratitude . Father, I am pleased to introduce Count of Santa Croce. The man who captured on Regina pirates. I'm so glad, you released duchy of a nightmare. I would not say that yet, still pirates have ships. A headless body is easily dismantled. Tell us your extraordinary adventure. - I'd rather not talk. - Do not be modest. All looking forward to hear the story of your mouth Not so, my noble friends? You're the woman who kept our fleet chess... Get up when you speak. I told you to get up... You'll laugh too much when you hanging with a rope around his neck. Death is a release for those forced to live... ... Into infamy and betrayal. I understand! Do allusion to the Count of Santa Croce... Very deep disappointment, is not it? Thought that an aristocrat would marry one like you? - Get out! - Dare me off... Out! Soon you remain silent forever. No more than one day. Many things can happen in one day... You're right. I had not thought. It was not hard to meet in a cave near the castle . Pirate Queen was punctual and Duke has come up with a few soldiers... that's all. A well-designed plan! It was quite improvidence. And they say women are very cautious . You look bewildered. Not find that it was a trap skillfully stretched ? No doubt. A famous compatriot of yours, Nicolo Machiavelli said... ... That the end justifies the means. Certainly morally... Please parent, not to mix with morality fight against pirates. But... Why not here, Isabela? - You've seen it, sir count? - No. You look, Dad? Count of Santa Croce was her word. You did a wonderful wedding gift... ... And I'll respond with a but equally beautiful. Come and see, please. What does that mean? The execution was scheduled tomorrow. I wanted to be present all the villagers. Why prolong the agony to that unfortunate? - You can not do this! - Who says ? You do not want to stop this execution and . Wait. Convict can not be hanged not received forgiveness church. Cesare do not understand your behavior. The count is right, if she did not get... End... It's just a formality. No. It's her right. It's our duty. Where's your duty... Please hurry. I hope you will give me an explanation. No need for an explanation, if we are the same religion. Conscious soul or her body? Pray with me... Our Father who art in heaven... Get out the kitchen door! Run! - What? Stop it! - Get him! Come! Let's go to the basement. On the walls...! Follow me! Fire! Fire continuously. Shooting Focus on ships. Fire! The hour of freedom. Follow me! The castle...!
