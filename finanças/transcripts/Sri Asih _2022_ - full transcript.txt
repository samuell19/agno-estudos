So? Are you happy? I heard there’s no such thing as pregnancy cravings. It's just in one's head, or to get the husband's attention. Cravings are hormonal, you know. It's hormonal to want to see Mount Merapi? Besides, since when are you into nature? I don't understand it, either. I dream of Merapi every day. Feels like it's calling me. But now that I'm here, I feel so happy. Excuse me, sir. Could you take our picture? Sure, young man. -Thank you, sir. -Sure. Ready... One, two, three. -Thank you. -You're welcome. So, have you decided on our baby's name? [trembling] Nay? What's wrong, honey? -It hurts! [trembling] -Nay! What is it, Nay? We have to go now! Let's go, honey! [rumbling] -It hurts! -Hold on, Nay! [Merapi erupts] Come on, Nay! You'll get through this! Come on, Nay! Hold on, Nay! Nay... Nayara? Nayara! Farzan, get us out of here! Hurry! -Yes, yes! -Hurry! -Move! [car horn] -Farzan, faster! [car speeding] [Nayara groaning] Hold on, honey! -Farzan! -Yes, my love! Be strong. Farzan... my water broke! -[Nayara groaning] -Impossible! You're only five months in. -[Nayara panting] -No way, Nay! -I'm going into labor now! -Nayara! -[Nayara whimpers] -Gosh, what now? [car speeding] Farzan! [car crashes into a tree] [car horn] Farzan... Farzan... [cries] Farzan! Baby, wake up! [cries] [cries, whimpers] [cries, groans] [cries, whimpers] Honey, wake up! [heavy breathing] My God... [car door opens] Oh... My baby... she's coming... [groans] Lie back, miss... Lie back, all right? Breathe. [pants] Push... [groans] Again... Again... Push... -[Nayara groans] -Yes... Push! [baby crying] Your power is fire. Your world is fire. Your sea of fire. Take it! Come on, take it! See if you can! -Come and take it! -Stop it! -You're going to rip it! -Rip it! Rip it! Hey! Give Tangguh back his comic book! -Sewer rat's angry! -She's got rabies! Leave it, Al! Al, leave it! Run! Run away! -Sewer rat's going crazy! -Careful! Rabies! Run! Al! Just let them go! Sewer rat! Run! Run! [panting] Sewer rat finally gave up. She's probably running back to the orphanage. Crying to one of the nuns. Hey! Give Tangguh his comic book back! Take it! Come on! Oops! Come on! Oops! Can't do it! Shorty! Don't worry. Stand your ground. We're boys! Al! [boy crashes into a tree] -[panting] Oh my God. -Alana! Don't ever bother Tangguh again. Pick on someone your own size! Hey! I'm sorry you had to see that, Miss Sarita. Alana isn't like the other kids. If what you saw worries you, or if you've changed your mind about adopting her, I completely understand. Alana did nothing wrong, miss. She was just defending me. You're lucky to have a friend like Alana. We're going now, okay? If anyone walks all over you, fight back! Your name means "tough". Be like your name. One day I'll follow you to Jakarta, Al! Hey! What's all this hugging? Come on now. [crowd cheering] Go, Alana! Control, Alana! Control. Push back! Yes! Again! Come on! Control, Alana! Control. [cheers, applause] [glasses clink] Cheers! -Congrats, Al! -Thank you! Hopefully, one day, me, Jimin, and the other guys can be as good as you. -Amen to that! -Amen! [glasses clink] Also, thank you to Mom. -Mom? -Yes? Thank you for being a patient coach. I love you, Mom. I love you, too, my champion. One day I'll be your champion, too, right? What champion? That's why you have to work hard, Jimin. So you can be like Al. And cut back on fried food. -Yes, Mom. -Now, cheers to Mom! To Mom! [glasses clink] Alana... Alana... [Alana screams] [panting] Al? What is it? -[Alana panting] -Al. What is it? She's back, Mom... But for years now, you've stopped having nightmares about her. [grunts] [thuds] Conquer yourself, Al. Don't let anger consume you. Al. If you let the anger control you, [thuds] one day it will destroy you! [grunts, pants] Control yourself! Release your anger. Control it, Al. -Release your anger. -[grunts, pants] Take hold of it, Alana! Release your anger. Release it. Release your anger! [groans] [pants] Control yourself, Alana! [grunts, pants] [grunts] [slams] Conquer her, Al. Only you have control over yourself. Alana... Al... I think you shouldn't fight for a while. It's dangerous. But I'm not letting her take control of my life again, Mom. We will defeat her. Okay? Are you okay, Al? [on TV] Today's breaking news. [on TV] Mateo Adinegara, son of businessman Prayogo Adinegara, who was accused of assault against a female friend will be released. MATEO ADINEGARA RELEASED -Mateo! Over here, Mateo! -[cameras snapping] Mateo, why did Calista suddenly retract her report? Well, because a gentleman like me can't possibly hurt a woman. That was just her bid for fame. -So, Calista is lying? -Is it true that she got threats from your father? You'd better watch your words! Mateo! Please answer, Mateo! Mateo! Answer us, Mateo! Are the police involved, Mateo? Please answer! Are the police involved? PRAYOGO ADINEGARA'S GOLDEN SON RELEASED! PROOF OF THE NATION'S CORRUPT LAW [Mateo on phone] I'll transfer later. Just tell the guys. All right, babe. Gotta go, okay? Bye. I'm preparing you so that one day you can take over all of this. So, you have to be wise with your actions... I get it, Dad. To keep your reputation clean. If you have beef with people, -have someone else do the dirty work. -I know, Dad! I'm not done yet! Keep your hands clean. I know, Dad. I understand. Next time I get caught up in trouble, I'll keep my hands clean. I'll have someone else deal with it. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. Come on. Chill, old man. I'm sorry, okay? That's my son. Gotta go, Dad. I'm sorry about that article. Don't worry. It's nothing. Muhammad Ghozali. Senior journalist. I have warned you multiple times. Leave Prayogo alone. More importantly, his family. You should've listened. Easy, right? You deal with that. His body's in a warehouse. Collect it and dump it on the street. Report it as armed robbery. Why are you giving me that look? He's just as rotten as the rest. What gets printed on the news depends on who's paying. Let them kill each other. It makes our job easier. [door opens] Jatmiko, one more thing. Tell the office boy to make me coffee. Have him bring it to my office. [motorbike passing] [residents chattering] Thank you. Hey, Mr. Jatmiko. Dad says the cops are bad people. They like to take money from the poor. There's no such thing as good cops. Is that true? -Here. Buy some candy or something. -Thanks. It's true, though, right? You’re nothing but watchdogs for people in power. Arrest those corrupt big fish. All you do is walk all over the poor. I'd be ashamed if I were your parent. Hey, throw that away! It's dirty money. Come inside! [muffled screaming] [on TV] Muhammad Ghozali, senior journalist of Bangsa Merdeka Daily was found dead this afternoon. He was a victim of an alleged armed robbery. His body was dumped on the outskirts of the city [drink can getting squished] last night. [punches, grunts] -[crowd cheering] -Let me hear you! [crowd cheering] [grunts, kicks] [crowd cheering] Remember, keep your mouth shut. Mateo cannot find out about this. -Easy, right? -Sure. Mateo wants to go. He said, he's allergic to poor people's smell. Devil kid! [glass thuds] This is what I'm talking about. Go on. You know there are no cheap drinks in my club. Not for a low-level cop like you. I'm here for work. I heard this club is a hotbed for drug dealing. If your father finds out about this, he'll be furious. Mind your own business. [slap] I'll do what I want in my club. As I recall, your boss and her men get hefty sums from my family to protect all our businesses. Including mine! Keep your nose out of anything between me and my father. I suggest you treat me nicely. It's about time... you changed that old jacket with a nice suit! Get your dad a fancy car. Buy your mom a luxury house. Pay for their Hajj pilgrimage. Okay? [pats] -There he is. -My baby. Baby, let me show you something. I got this video from a friend. This fighter girl, she's really crazy, oh my God! Girl? Darn, bro. This girl is on fire, man! And you know what? -Apparently, she's undefeated. -Really? Okay, faster. Good. Watch the kick. Again. Can I help you? I want Alana. And I want her down in round three. After that... we can all go home, and move on with our lives. Easy, right? And if I say no? Then you've yet to understand who I work for. I don't care who you work for. Please leave. And don't ever come back. What's going on, Mom? It's nothing. [gunshot] You filth! Gilang! No! [heavy breathing] Get out of my gym. Leave! Not now. I need more time. I know better. I'm the one who raised her. Thank you. Such a fancy place. So different from our usual arena. [exhales] And the AC is so cool. The room smells great. No sweaty armpits. Stop drooling. Just act normal. If Miss Sarita finds out, we're all dead. I'm doing this for our fight club. I know how much that place means to my mom and to you guys. Remember you've to be down in the third... Yeah, I know. No need to remind me every five minutes. [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] Al, remember. Okay? [crowd cheering] Mateo! Yeah! [crowd cheering] Go, baby! Fighters ready? You... I can pay you a lot more just to spend the night with me. [sneers] Such a waste. I'm paying a pretty girl like you [snaps] just to get beat up. Isn't that what you do? Beating up girls? Maybe your mom forgot to teach you how to treat women. Come then. I can teach you a lesson. Fighters! Starting position! Fighters ready? Fight! [bell dings] [punches] [grunts] [in pain] Oh sh...! [punches, grunts] Alana! -Alana! [punches, grunts] -Al! Enough, Al! [punches, grunts] Go, baby! Hey, Mateo! Hang in there, man! Come on, you can do it! Al, enough, let him go. -[coughs] I'll kill you! -Hey! -Al, enough. -Get off me! -Enough, Al! We finish this round... -Hey! then we go home and move on! Okay, Al? Just watch! You're done after this! -Al, don't you go crazy. -Don't worry. -Al, remember. -Yes, I remember. Al, remember! Three rounds. Let him win. [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] Alana! Enough! Stop it. Let go! Oh, no. We're dead! Alana. Al! Get off me! Alana! [crowd cheering] There you go! Is that all you got? [panting] You should learn how to respect men! [echoes] Alana... [echoes] Release it. [echoes] Release your anger! [echoes] Release it. Release your anger! Alana! [phone ringing] Hello? Al, it's your mom. Mom! What happened to her? Mom! Sorry, please wait outside. What happened? Mateo's men wrecked our club. Everything's destroyed. Fighters were threatened, too. If we stick with Miss Sarita, they'll finish us off. How is she? Miss Sarita's okay, right? Alana, how is she? Gilang, answer me. [Mateo groans] I said don't touch! [motorbike speeding] What are you doing here? Out of my way! Where's Mateo? Alana, wait! [grunts, slams] Where's Mateo? [choking] I have nothing to do with Mateo! I remember you. Why are you following me? [choking] There's something I need to explain to you. [coughs] I know your mom! Don't do this. You'll make things worse. [grunts] Think about your mom. She still needs you. I'm sorry, Mom. I promise... [sniffles] after this... I just want to be a good kid. I promise. Tell me... What happened? What? That girl was here... [sobs] and fought Mateo's bodyguards. [sniffles] I was hit repeatedly [sniffles] until I passed out. [sobs] When I woke up, [sniffles] everyone was dead. [sobs] [Gisel sobbing] Gisel, who's the girl? Who's the girl? [sniffles] Alana. The girl who took down Mateo at the fight. I asked you to watch Mateo! I entrusted Mateo to you! Look at him now! I can't find evidence from the CCTV. It's as if someone disconnected the network on purpose. I will deal with this myself. You stay out of it. I want no one to be involved. Cover this incident up. Doctor. Doctor! Help me out! Mom! Mom! Mom! Al! Mom! Alana! You have to go! Mom! Al, you have to get out of here! You have to get out of here! [sobs] Listen to me! Alana! -You have to get out of here, Al! -[sobbing] Mom! You have to leave this place now! Al, listen to me! You have to leave this place now! Al! Al! Al! Al! Don't go with them! We have to go. We have to get out of here now! [men grunt] [Alana screams] [whispers] What did I just do? You'll know soon enough. Come on. Sir, get out of here, quick! Don't stay here! Get out, sir! It's not safe here! Mom! [panting] Mom! I thought I'd never see you again. What is this place? This is my house. I am Eyang Mariani. Kala's mother. Kala is my name. You haven't introduced yourself? So typical of you, Kala. How will you ever find a girlfriend? You stupid, stupid boy. [clears throat] My son was right. You're beautiful. [clears throat] Mom... We finally get to meet. Who are you people? There's something we have to tell you. Sit down, child. Since the dawn of time... before humans came into existence... [projector clicks] powerful beings have roamed the world. They are divided in two. [projector clicks] Those who do good for Life, led by the Goddess Asih. [projector clicks] And those full of hate, [projector clicks] full of malice, who destroy and bring misery, led by the Fire Goddess. The war between them happened periodically. Until Nusantara, the Indonesian archipelago, came to life. A great battle ensued between the two. [projector clicks] The Goddess Asih succeeded in defeating the Fire Goddess. The Fire Goddess was then locked up inside a volcano. But, the Fire Goddess can be freed from captivity... if all of her five commanders are resurrected. The first one. [projector clicks] A Mighty Warrior and his powerful sorcery. [projector clicks] Next, a half-human half-demon being, with a thirst for blood. Next... [projector clicks] A demon boy. Intelligent and powerful. [projector clicks] Then, a she-demon who rules over the ocean. And the fifth one. An evil spirit possessing the body of a human being who destroys and torments. It is called the Demon Spirit. And if the Fire Goddess is resurrected... it will not only lead to the nation's demise. But also the world. What does any of this have to do with me? The Goddess Asih promised... to pass down her powers to a human being... from time to time. In 1954, nine years after the nation's independence, there was a woman named Nani Wijaya. [projector clicks] She was a patriot known as Sri Asih. [projector clicks] Sri Asih aided the Nguleh Jiwo operation. It means "the return to Java." At the time, during the Dutch occupation many people were sent to Suriname to be detained... and turned into cheap laborers. [projector clicks] Jagabumi. That is the name of our circle. We are continuously chronicling, tracking down, and protecting the descendants of the Goddess Asih. Because we are certain The Goddess Asih will rise again... through her descendants. And then we got the news... of the deaths of your parents and their missing baby. Even before you were born... the Fire Goddess knew that you would be a vessel for the Goddess Asih. She wants to take you over, control your mind... so that you will not continue her adversary's fight. Alana. You are the next Goddess Asih incarnate. I want the girl dead. Do you hear me, Prayogo? I want her dead. Who is this girl, really? This Sri Asih costume was worn by Nani Wijaya. This one... was prepared specifically for you. Those pieces of jewelry... are extremely powerful heirlooms. With the blessing of the Almighty... it is time to stabilize and harness your powers. Out of the goddess from whom all goodness flows. The Goddess Asih. The red scarf Becomes A charm of strength Rides the winds precautiously For the Mother Earth The almighty god and prince. Unite the spirit of Goddess Asih. To destroy the wrath. Your gracious power. Your gracious world. Your radiating love. Sea of Wisdom. Oh, Lord The Great Unite the spirit of our goddess The power for good Make the world peaceful Your radiating love Goddess Asih, may you bless Sri Asih. Gain supernatural powers. Gain a blessing. Become one! My gracious power. My world of peace. My radiating love. My ocean, ocean of wisdom. We live in a world that must prioritize safety, happiness, and well-being, and eradicating the nature of the wrath. [train passing by] Excuse me! What do you think caused this fire? Aren't you suspicious? Of the same incident happening repeatedly? Is this foul play? Why aren't the police investigating further? -Excuse me, but... -Sir, you should go. You're the police! Protectors of the community. Who are you really protecting? The poor or just rich businessmen? Where is your conscience? This afternoon, a fire broke out in the slums. A local's short circuit is thought to be the cause. The fire spread and devastated the area. Short circuits, fires. An epidemic, poisoning, what next? Prayogo is really out to kill all the slum residents as sacrifices. Sacrifices? Do you remember the story about the Fire Goddess' five commanders? Yes. He is the Demon Spirit. The evil spirit that possesses the body of a human being. Full of hate. Full of malice. They want to do the sacrificial ritual of a thousand souls. To resurrect... the army of a thousand demons. You're saying that the victims at the slums were sacrifices? Yes. And we have to prevent it. [projector clicks] The Demon Spirit possesses a powerful heirloom necklace. And we know Prayogo Adinegara has that necklace. Prayogo Adinegara, Mateo's father? The one who tried to kill Mom? So we believe he must be the Demon Spirit. His powers... come from that heirloom necklace. To annihilate his powers we have to rip that necklace off him. But because his strength is so great... it can only be challenged... by a strength just as great. Or greater. In the next several years... we will see this city change... to become a modern one. Dignified. And honorable. If all of you agree with my plans... Wait, wait. Isn't that too ambitious? The city still has many slums. And a great number of poor people. Even the government can't handle it. Our government is too weak. They don't have a plan. I do. The planet is getting overpopulated. We have to share. Land... water... food supply... shelter. Is it fair... that we have to share with the poor? The lazy? They are a bunch of roaches that must be exterminated for the good of this country. Don't think that I am cruel. I'm merely aiding the government's program to fight poverty. [exhales] I agree with your principles. People say our country is rich. So if some live in poverty, that just means they are a bunch of fools. Useless. Just polluting this country. Isn't that so? What you have yet to realize is... the powers that the Goddess Asih passed down are stronger by 10 folds than you know. But those powers will only come when used for good. Not for anger or greed. Take it all. -Arm your men. -Yes, Boss! The rest will come after it's finished. [car drives by] That devil kid is dead now. No more cleaning up after his mess. Our lives are easier, right? But we've got to find Alana fast. Before the Boss sends us to hell. If Prayogo isn't the one sending you after Mateo to hell, I'll send you there first. What? Surprised to see me? Don't be. I admit. For a girl... you're not half bad. You mean for a girl who just took down two of your men? I think I deserve better praise than that. Try again. I can't wrap my head around it. How did you have the heart to hurt my mom? I thought you didn't want the police involved. So why am I here? I want you to exhaust your forces. Get this girl, bring her to me! I will keep looking for her. No need! You've embarrassed yourself enough. There's something else you have to do. Find Gisel. Leon said she was hiding something about Mateo's death. You find her! Excuse me. Jatmiko! If you manage to catch this girl, I can promise you a better life. You don't want to be a poor cop all your life, do you? Gisel! Why are you avoiding me? You never pick up my calls. You never reply to my messages. [sniffles] Leon, you'd better get out of here. -Gisel! -[Gisel gasps] Who told you to show Alana's fight video to Mateo? You had ulterior motives, didn't you? Leon, leave now. Please, I'm begging you! -You have to tell me! -Please! Did you have breakfast? Later. I'm not hungry. Okay. If you're hungry later... breakfast is on the table. Sure. Thanks. Oh, yes. Uhm... What is it, Kala? Fidgeting back and forth. [clears throat] Nothing, Mom. I forgot something. I just wanted to inform you. Kembangan public housing is Prayogo's next target. The residents there are always terrorized. Some chose to move out because they can't take it. But some are still holding out. That is all from me. Thank you. -Get out of here! -Please have mercy. -Scram! -Yes. I'll crack your head open! You're not a resident here, right? Who are you looking for? What do you want? She's my friend. It's her first time here. Come in. [holds door] I know who you are. Don't you dare mess around here. Don't try and be a freaking hero. [door closes] Are you looking for someone here? Maybe I can help. I think I have the wrong address. I see. Oh, I'm Tangguh. [chaos] Those thugs are terrorizing this place. So the residents get rattled and leave. It's better if you stick around for a bit until they go away. If anyone walks all over you... fight back. Your name means "tough." Be like your name. Al? Alana? I finally found you. I told you, right? I'd follow you to Jakarta. So after all these years, you're still beating people up? Professional fighter. Er, it's the same thing, Al. [scoffs] It's different! Whatever you say. And you after all these years, people are still walking all over you? Did you hear about this? Their bodies were found today in a dumpster. What is actually going on? Who's there? [gun clicks] [slams documents] Deal with this. Jatmiko. Get me some coffee and bring it to my office. RATNA KUMALA, LL.B., LL.M. POLICE CHIEF This hair is nice. [exhales] Have your lunch after this, sweetie. Yes, Mom. The people are questioning your promise. You said, your writing can help make the government care more about them. To have Prayogo incarcerated I need cold, hard evidence. I hope you and the residents here can be patient. Okay? [knocking on door] Ready to go? [exhales] Oh, Kala, meet Tangguh. Tangguh, meet Kala. Oh. Renjana. Alana, this is Renjana. She lives in this building, too. Someone threw a Molotov cocktail at her place last night. Luckily the fire was put out quickly. The residents here are getting more threatened. The thugs have already cut off some of the units' electrical and water lines. [exhales] We don't know what they might do in the future. But we have to persevere. Hi. The recent events have traumatized Kinar. She won't even leave home to go to school. Take it, sweetheart. [whispers] Go on, it's okay. You don't have to worry, Kinar. Let me face them. So they won't bother you and your mom again. Okay? You shouldn't have trusted people that easily. Especially when it involves Alana. As far as I know, Alana also has business with Prayogo. And this person has important information for Alana, too. -What if it's a trap? -Just calm down. I've arranged everything. Relax. I just wanted to let you know Prayogo has dispatched the police to watch your every move. Especially you, Tangguh. They're bound to catch you soon. They know that you're considered a provocative reporter. As for you, Alana. You're in danger. Prayogo is after me because I was accused of murdering his son. -But I am not Mateo's murderer. -I believe you. [scoffs] Yes and you're not even trying to prove it. Not this time. I want you all to know I'm on your side. If you need my help, I'll be there. And for more information about Prayogo, maybe this can help. Tomorrow night he's hosting a masquerade. A little warning, be careful. Why aren't you on Prayogo's side? Money can't buy everyone, miss. Thank you for coming and supporting my family. Tonight we're doing a fundraising to remember my son, Mateo. And hello to you, gentlemen. Thank you for your support to my family. Why does it have to be a masquerade? [scoffs] Maybe so the corrupt people and the mafia won't recognize each other. Or maybe... they don't want to see each other's faces. Because it's as disgusting as their own. [applause] [applause] Good evening. I would like to say thank you to everyone in attendance. Tonight's fundraising is also... to remember my son... whom I love dearly. Mateo Adinegara. In his lifetime, Mateo was known as a person who cared about social issues and humanitarian. To honor that, I dedicate tonight to Mateo. To Mateo! It seems like they're planning something. ONE OF THE CITY'S SLUMS BURNS TO THE GROUND This fundraising will not only help our fellow human beings. It is also our investment for the afterlife. Thank you. [applause] All right, ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy the party! Have you contacted Jagau? Yesterday, he just disappeared! -Find him! -Yes, sir. You wait here. Let me find Prayogo. A threat in corridor one! [grunts] [gunshots] [grunts] [gunshots] [chokes] I won't hurt you if you surrender! [commotion] Get out! [commotion] [lights off] I'll kill you! Get out! All of you! -What's happening, Tangguh? -I'll go check. [chaos] [bangs] Out! Out! Out! [banging] Hey! Go! Get out! Out! [banging] Get out! Wake Kinar up, we have to go. -Hurry! -Yes. Al! Did you manage to rip the necklace off? -Something is not right. -Huh? [gasps] Okay. My mother just told me that the Kembangan public housing is under attack. We should head over there now. [grunts, screams] Tangguh! [pants] Tangguh, what do we do? Hey, you! You're an embarrassment! [slams] Nowhere else for you to go. Please. Don't hurt them. -You're a piece of work! -[thud] -Stand back! -Oh, dear God. Al? Hurry! Get out of here! Hands up! Hands up! Put that down! Weapons down! Get down! Squat down! Down! Weapons down! -Look at me! Eyes here! -Yes, sir! Let's go, ma'am. Hey, please help. [coughs] Come on, ma'am, sir. All good? All good. Kinar, don't be afraid. You have to be brave. You'll meet many friends there, okay? What matters is that you'll be somewhere safe. I'll definitely catch up with you. -You be careful. -Always. Be careful. It's a different necklace. If Prayogo isn't the Demon Spirit... then who is? It means our theory, that the slums' victims are part of the sacrificial ritual of a thousand souls is wrong. Sacrifices? Sorry. What? Al, help me out here. But what's most important is that the residents were saved. Where were they taken? A temporary shelter. Al, what I saw earlier, that was really you, right? I wasn't hallucinating? Oh, dear God. I just remembered. The sacrificial ritual of a thousand souls... has to be done at the same time. Which means a thousand people must be gathered in a single place... and get killed at once. Where did you say the residents were taken to? -A temporary shelter. -Where? Ah, I'm not sure. But every time a slum gets hit by a tragedy, they're all taken by the same buses. And the same uniformed officers, too. Where are the officers from? I'm not sure, either. What are you doing here? Sorry. I'm trying to find the location of the public housing residents from yesterday. To this second, I can't contact any one of them. Do you know where their shelter is? That's not within my jurisdiction. If I find anything, I'll let you know. Don't ever come here again. Got it? Sorry. Kala. Try and look through our ancestor's ancient book. All the answers should be in there. That includes where the ritual will be held. As it cannot be done in just any location. Wait, wait. I remember something. Jakarta was once a kingdom. The Demon Spirit came to be because the king invited the devil. This symbol has to mean something. What symbol? A numeric symbol in ancient Javanese script. This symbol shows the Earth's coordinates. The map says it's a factory. Sinar Sentosa factory. SINAR SENTOSA FACTORY CLOSED DOWN There's an article that says this factory was closed two months ago. Because of a supernatural event that caused all the workers to get possessed. Until today, not one person is willing to work there. Looks like this location used to be called the Demon Kingdom. Both of you go there now! Before the sacrificial ritual takes place. Al. I couldn't get any info on the whereabouts of the residents. We got it. You did? Where are you going? Excuse me, Eyang. Tonight is one of the most important nights in human history. There will be no one to record it in history, of course. But some will know. You are fortunate. Because you will know, Ganda. If the Demon Spirit vessel is so important... why was I not given the task, sir? I have always been loyal to you. There is not enough anger in you, Ganda. Not like this soul. Besides... I need you with me at all times. After the Demon Spirit completes the sacrificial ritual of a thousand souls, the army of a thousand demons will rise. And the Demon Spirit's power will grow so strong, that it would be near impossible to defeat. One by one, we will resurrect the commanders, Ganda. Are you ready? Ready, sir. We are getting closer to the return of our lord. The Fire Goddess. Oh my dear God, Al. Al. I can't believe it. How are you this strong? Where did you train? You go check the other rooms. Who am I going with? Wow. I hope you're not weighing me down. I hope you can handle all that's coming with a cool head. Okay? Try to talk it out nicely first. Can you shut up? I'm getting hotheaded listening to you. [punches] Where are you going? Calm down. We don't want any trouble. Did you try talking it out nicely with them? -Well, I could've... -Shut up. God darn you! Who strikes from behind! [pants] Screw it. Prepare over there! [laughter] Welcome, Sri Asih. Who are you really? You would never have guessed. That I am the one behind all this. But that doesn't surprise me. I'm used to it. Being underestimated, looked down upon. If you have a self-confidence problem, take a self-improvement course. Not this. I like your sense of humor. But what a shame, I'm on the clock. Don't get too cocky. You're not that good. We've been waiting for you, Sri Asih. Help! Help! Please open the door! That's gotta be them. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help us, sir! They're over there! [chaos] Sir, help us! Calm down! We're letting you all out! -[chaos] Help! -Renjana! -[chaos] Tangguh! -Renjana! -[chaos] Hey! Are you okay? -Tangguh! [chaos] Stop! -Are you all right? -I'm okay. Uncle Tangguh! Help me! [chaos] Where's the key to the door? [chaos] [slams] Answer me! Shoot! [slams] Answer! [slams] Answer! Answer! Or your other leg gets it! Get up! [slams] [laughs] It's no use! All the doors are locked automatically and they're controlled by my master! [chaos] No one can open them but him! You will not stop me, Sri Asih. You will meet your fate tonight. Let's end this now. What's the rush? I want you to stick around. To witness the rise of the greatest power. Invincible to anyone. Ten more minutes. Patience... Alana. [chaos] What's happening? [chaos] What does this mean? Answer me! [chaos] In that cell, there's a bomb set to go off in a few minutes. [chaos] We're all going to die here! [chaos escalates] Bomb! There's a bomb! What are you planning? Answer me! [grunt in frustration] [pants] Where's Alana? (pants) Alana! Alana! Al! Can you hear me, Al? They're going to blow this place up! Do you think you can save them without taking me down first? Alana! You have to help them before this place explodes! [cries] Uncle Tangguh, please let me and Mom go. Kinar, stay calm okay. I'll protect you and your mom. Al! You have to get here now! I can see the anger in you. Release it, Alana. Release your anger! Fight me! Don't you want this necklace? Fight me! [echoes] Alana. Release it. Release your anger! [echoes] Forget them. [echoes] Join us. [echoes] Alana. My gracious power. My world of peace. My ocean, ocean of wisdom. Anger is not a part of my nature. [Fire Goddess screams] God almighty! Hurry! Everyone get out of here! Everyone out! Out! Go! Out! Everyone out! Everyone out! Tangguh! Come on! Everyone! Come on! [explosion] [gasps] Al! [Demon Spirit screams] [Demon Spirit screams] [people sobbing] Tangguh! [people sobbing] Kal! Kala! Tangguh! -Hey! You okay? -I'm okay. What about Alana? Don't worry. Mom! Mom, where are you? Kinar. Kinar? Kinar! -Kinar! -Renjana! -Tangguh! -Renjana! Tangguh! Tangguh, Kinar's gone! Kinar! Kinar! Kinar's gone! I have to find her! -Kinar! -Mom! You're okay, right? Thank you. I've kept my promise. There is nothing for you to be afraid of. Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you, dear. What is your name? Sri Asih. Sri Asih! Oh, Sri Asih! Thank you, Asih! Thank you! Thank you. -My pleasure. Excuse me. -Yes. Al. Why didn't you just tell me the truth? No mother would ever... want their child to always be in constant danger. And a mother's instinct... is always to protect their child, Al. But... If I were not Sri Asih, would you still have... Having you as my daughter is the greatest gift in my life. I love you, Mom. There is another who has powers like you, Sri Asih. His name is Gundala. He needs your help. How can I help him? You will all be connected together. With the power of the Goddess Asih. But, Mom the suit is still being fixed. We still have Nani Wijaya's suit. Stop the car! Pull over! Hey! I heard you refused to pay the security fee? Are you trying to be a hero? Huh? I'll beat you up! [grunts] [grunts, slashes]
