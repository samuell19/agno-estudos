Subtitles by explosiveskull [barking] [groaning] Oh... - Oh... - [barking] Come on, come on, go, go, go, go! Look away. Come on, we're coming through. - Go, go, go. Come on. - You'll be okay. You'll be alright. It's alright. You're gonna be fine. Thank you, Stubby. Come on. Out the way, everybody. Let's go. Let's go. [indistinct chatter] - Well done, boy. - Good boy. - [whimpering] - He saved him again. That's a good dog. [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] [sniffing] [car horn honking] [whining] [grumbling] Get out of here, you stinkin' mutt! Go rifle through someone else's trash. [whimpering] - Go! - [thump] - [woman squeals] - Watch it, mutt. - [tires screeching] - [horn honking] [man] Come on! Whose dog is that? [panting] - [yelping] - [cheering] [band playing] - [indistinct chatter] - [sniffing] [woman] We're so proud of you. [grumbling] - [woman] Take care! - [man] We're proud of you! [cheering and applause] [woman] When my brother put on the uniform of the United States Army, I was so very proud. In 1917, our country went to war with Germany. All across the nation, thousands of young men answered the call to fight. They were just boys. Well, they were called Doughboys, and my brother Robert was one of them. By the time we joined the war in April 1917, the French and British had already been fighting the mighty German Army for three long years. Their spirits were low. But they were happy to know that we were coming to help. This is the true story of a special friendship my brother made while training for the war. [patriotic music playing] [whimpering] Oh, no, you don't. Scram, mutt! [grumbling] Scram! [Sergeant] Left! Left! Left, right, left! - Platoon... halt! - [grumbling] Left... face! At ease! [sniffing] No time for lip spittle, boys. We have four short weeks left to turn you into soldiers. You've worked hard on drill, learned teamwork, discipline. But... next is the crump-hole. That's why you and I are here. [humming] Wha... How did this dog get in here? Get out! Get out of here! Hey! Ah! [groans] - [whining] - Hey. Hey. Shhh. Shhh. Get off of me. Come on, go. I don't have any more food. Go away. Shoo. Come on, you're gonna get me in trouble. Get off. [Sergeant] Our General Pershing's... - Off. Go. - ...gonna change all that. Shoo. Shoo. Go. Get away. [panting] When we get there, we're gonna take the fight to the enemy. [barks] [scoffs] At least he's ready. [barks] This pooch belong to any of you men? I see you eyeballing him, Private Conroy. - [barks] - Better fetch that dog a bone. Looks like he could use it. Platoon, atten... tion! - [barks] - [chuckles] Dismissed. Alright. Come on, boy, you heard the sergeant. Let's go. [woman] And that's how Robert met his new little buddy. Come on, move along. This is not a picnic. [whining] It's that mutt again. Sergeant says get him fed. Eh? I don't cook for dogs. Hey, Biscuit, he might be the only one that likes your cooking. Better be nice to him. [mumbling in Italian] [scoffs] You really know how to make friends, don't you, Olsen? Sure do. Always. You, uh, find a new buddy, Conroy? No, actually, he kinda found me. - Isn't that right, boy? - [barks] Can't believe the sergeant let the dog stay. - He must feel sorry for us. - [Olsen] Alright, alright. The sergeant gave him a pass, but the colonel never will. Maybe the sergeant wanted a mascot, to give the unit a different look. Ugh. A different smell, too. Hey, no, wait! What the... No! Bad dog! Bad dog! - [growling] - [man laughing] I hate dogs. No, no, no, no, no. - Hey, hey, listen. - [grumbling] Listen. Stay. No. St... Stay. Good. You sleep there, on the floor, not in my bed. Good. [sighing] Good night, boy. [whimpering] [grumbling] That's enough shuteye! On your feet! Out of the sack! [gasps] [grunting] [Sergeant] Left! Left! Left, right, left! Column left... march! [whining] Left! Left! Left, right, left! Left! Left! Left, right, left! Left! Left! Go! Go! Go! - [soldiers panting] - [growling playfully] Over the wall, Clayborn, not through it! - [barking] - I got it. [groaning] Whose target is that? - [barking] - Hey, boy, go fetch it. He's quite a dog you got there, Conroy. Not even afraid of the sound of gunfire. Well done, soldier. - Thank you, Sergeant. - Not you. You missed the target completely. - I was talking to the dog. - [barks] Pick up your feet, Olsen! One after the other! [barking] [gasps] [groans] Oh. Ow. Back of the line, Conroy. Do it again. [barking] [growling softly] Put your glasses on, Schroeder! The enemy's that way! - [soldiers panting] - [barking] [woman] I loved hearing how this little dog trained right alongside Robert and his buddies. [Sergeant] Platoon... halt! [woman] Robert's letters were full of his exploits. It made me happy to know how much joy the dog brought to my kid brother. [Sergeant] At ease. Look at him. He has been training alongside you guys and he drills better than most of you. You could all learn something from him. [all gasp] [stifled laughter] [all laugh] I hope you'll be able to keep him, Conroy. This is the army, Schroeder. If they don't issue it, you don't need it. That includes pets. All the same, I'm keeping him. In fact, I thought of a name for him... Stubby. [barks] It's a perfect name for a perfect little tail. Ain't that right? [chuckles] Yeah, right, Stubby? Whoa. One thing's for certain. When the colonel catches him, it's bye-bye, doggie. - [barks] - Hm. Maybe not. Alright, bud. Listen to me, listen. Alright, stay calm. - [growls playfully] - Stay... No, listen. Sit. Sit. Stubby, come on. We're gonna stay here all night until we get this right. Hold it... hold it. [barks] Hold... it. - [typewriter clicks] - [patriotic music playing] ♪ Over there, over there ♪ Send the word send the word over there ♪ That's you, men. You're the Yankee Division. That includes you too, Stubby. - [barking] - [chuckling] What in Sam Hill is that dog doing here? Platoon, attention! This is an army base, not a petting zoo! Whose dog is this? Yes, he's my dog, Colonel, sir. [whimpering] [panting] [chuckling] What in tarnation? Did you train this dog, soldier? Yes, sir. Wasn't that hard, sir. Next thing you know, he'll be barking out general orders. Uh, sir, what would you have us do with the dog? Well, as long as that dog soldiers like that, he's as welcome as any man in this army. Carry on, men. [barks] You're something else, Stubby. [bugle playing fanfare] [Stubby whimpering] [barking] [whimpering] [growling] [barking] [whimpering] Remove your gas masks. Do it! Do it now! [coughing] [whimpering] Outside! Now! This is teargas, men, not the mustard or poisonous gas you will be facing. Keep your masks handy at all times. Get used to them, learn to live in them. [growling] [whimpering] [soldiers groaning and coughing] [bugle playing] - [Conroy chuckles] - [barks] Alright, Stubs, here we go. [barks] [laughing] Ah, okay, Stubby, you're too quick for me, boy. [Sergeant] Left! Left! Left, right, left! To the rear! March! Left! Left! Left, right, left! Left! Left! Left, right, left! Platoon... halt! Left... face! At ease. Well done, gentlemen. You've come a long way. You too, Stubby. - [panting] - [bugle playing] Yep, that's right, it's chow time, boy. Hey, Stubby, look what I got for you. Hey, Biscuit, can we get something other than dog food? I'm not talking to you, Olsen. I'm talking to Stubby. How'd you end up here, Schroeder? Yeah, you're a German, ain't you? If a German doesn't join, he's a slacker. - A what? - A draft dodger. [chuckles] That's why you joined? Do you see how people look at Germans these days? If I didn't join, I couldn't call myself an American. Hey, you know what, Schroeder? You're an American in my book. I've watched you men become soldiers. It makes me proud. You, too, Stubby. I hope you stay on the base to look after the next group. Now, take this weekend to write your letters and say your farewells. And pray that we will all be home safe and sound very soon. We ship out on Monday night. God bless us all, and God bless the United States of America. Take charge of your men, Sergeant. [Sergeant] Dismissed! [woman] Robert told me how scared he and the other boys were when they finally got word it was time to go to war. I didn't receive Robert's last letter from camp until he had set sail for France. He wrote me about how he would miss me, but mainly how heartbroken he was at having to leave Stubby behind. - [whines] - Not right now, Stubby. [woman] I was just so worried, and I prayed he'd be home again soon. [whimpering] Stubby, come on. This is really hard for me, too. You're going to be fine and I will be back before you know it. Look. I got a gift for you. [whimpering] [barking] [grumbling] Hold it, Stubby, hold it! [laughing] Look at you, handsome boy! Looking good, Stubby! Come now. [whimpering] Like I promised, he'll be here for you when you get back. I'll take good care of him. You hear that, Stubby? You'll never be hungry. [barks softly] [sighs] [whimpering] [barking] [whimpering] [barking] Stay, Stubby. Don't worry, I'll be back soon. [soldier] Come on, Conroy, get in line. Let's go. [barking and whimpering] [engine rumbling] [whimpering] [sighing] [growling softly] [dishes rattling] Stubby! Where you going? [train whistle blows] [train chugging] [ship's horn blowing] [men shouting] [soldier] Up, up, up, up. Bring that up. Hey. Hey, watch your head over there. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. [sniffing] [wood creaking] [wind blowing] [barks softly] [whimpers] [gulls squawking] [sniffing] [men snoring softly] [barks] Ow. Stubby? How did you get here? Where did you come from? How did you get here? What are we going to do with you? We'll have to hide you. Somehow. [Olsen] Oh, brother, it's the mutt. How did he get here? I don't know. It's a miracle. Stubby, you're just so clever, aren't you? [Olsen] This is a really dumb idea. - [whining] - Shhh, Stubby. Shhh. We can't let them hear you. When they find him, they're gonna throw him overboard. [groaning] [all gasp] Who in the...? What...? What the...? What the devil is going on here? [panting] [clears throat] Better salute, sir. Someone's got a lot of explaining to do. Who smuggled this dog aboard? He followed me on the train, sir! He was quite determined. But I swear I did not carry him on board, sir. He sort of became the regiment's unofficial mascot, sir. I didn't carry him on board, either, sir. You're quite resourceful, aren't you, boy? Why, thank you, fella. Well, I guess it's better to have every man and every dog we can get in this fight. Make sure he receives some... dog tags. Carry on. Mother! How does he keep getting away with this? There ya go, Stubby. You're a real Yankee now. [barks] [woman] Every day, we scanned the newspapers for news of the Minnesota. They were full of stories about our boys being lost at sea, but nothing about the Yankee Division. I had no idea that Stubby had made it onboard. [ship's horn sounds] [crows cawing] [woman] It was two long months before I got word that Robert and Stubby were safely in France... when I heard that they were headed into action at a place called Chemin des Dames, where they were going to join the French lines. [crows cawing] - [rumbling] - [soldiers coughing] - [man] The Americans. - [soldiers muttering] - [soldier coughing] - [whimpering] [coughing] Mother, they look like they've been through the wringer. That's why we're here, I guess. [soldier] Shhh. - [rumbling] - [soldier groaning] [rumbling continues] - [snoring] - [mouse squeaking] - [growling] - [squeaking] [barking] - [snarling and barking] - [squeaking] [soldier speaking French] - [squeaking] - [snapping teeth] [barking] [woman] Evidently, Stubby wasted no time - in making himself useful. - [growling] He began by clearing the vermin from the trenches. [birds chirping] [groaning] I'm hungry. Somebody tell me there's breakfast. [bird chirping] [bird chirping frantically] - [missile whistling] - Incoming! Take cover! [men] Get down. Get down! - Hey, get down! - Oh! [whimpering] [explosion] - Medic! Medic! - [man] Keep down! [whimpering] [man speaking in French] Attention! [confused shouting] [whimpering] [woman] From his first day in action, Stubby was on a mission. - [barking] - [man] Medic! [woman] And he dug out many soldiers who'd been buried. [soldiers shouting in French] [woman] Robert was so proud of him. [whimpering] [Frenchman] Injured man coming through! To your positions! You must hold them! Stay on the wall and watch for an attack! Come, Sergeant, look. - [laughter] - [distant chatter] - I'll be darned. - [men speaking German] Okay, but we must not let down our guard. This time, it was only a little welcome from our Boche friends. Move along, Yanks, move along. You cannot save us if you hang around in here. Come on. Next. I don't think they like us. I thought "Yankee" was a good word. Excuse me, uh, something for my dog, please. For your dog? Are you crazy, Yankee? He is a soldier. He's the division mascot. - Name's Stubby. - [barks] You see his dog tags? And now a Boche is telling me to give good French food to an American dog? [sighs] This war is getting crazier every day. I am an American. Oh, ja, ja. Of course you are. [laughing] Yeah. He is American! Do you understand? Well, he sounds like a Boche to me. And you sound like a moron, froggy! Quoi? [Olsen] Ow! - [men shouting] - [Stubby barking] Enough, you two. We are here to fight the Boche, not each other. - [barking] - Allez. Un bisou. [men jeering] [laughing] Now, that's better. - We are all friend now, huh? - [Stubby growling] [Conroy] Stubby, shhh. Calm down. Calm down. Come here. Calm down, Stubby. American soldier. You must be Conroy, no? Yes. I'm... I'm Conroy. I am Gaston Baptiste of the Third Regiment, and we are to be working together. My Capitaine says, "Look for a man with a little dog." Hmm. Really? Yes. You, me and your, uh, little friend... [growling] You will get so close to the Boche, you will be able to smell them. [sniffs] [gasps] Have you ever used one of these? Hmm? Uh, yeah. Yeah, in basic training. [growling] [chuckles] It's also perfect for cheese. Want to try some? I must apologize for this slop that cook calls food. - It's war. I understand. - No, there is no excuse! Napoleon says an army marches on its stomach, so they should fill ours with good food. - Voila. - [Stubby whining] Uh... So, what exactly are we going to be doing? Can you ride a horse? No? Yes, yes. I mean, I'm... I might not be the best, but you know, I'm okay. Good, because our officers have decided that we will be spying on the Boche. Hmm? You, me and, uh... - Salty. - Actually, it's Stubby. Okay. But first, let's celebrate. Uh... No. No, mais it's only wine. You don't like wine, American soldier? [laughs] I never drank wine, and I'm sure it's against the rules for us. The rules? What rules? Ha! This is war. Ah. Without wine, we French would not have survived these three years, so they give it to us. - The French army gives you wine? - Bien sûr, mon ami! We French go from the milk of our mothers to the juice of the vine. [chuckles] Hey, you hear that, Stubby? - They get wine. - [barks] Eh. Okay, let's go. Hey, Conroy, Conroy. What's happening? Uh, apparently, I have to follow him. Eh. Lucky you. And you two, come with me. [crows cawing] This is horrible. Everything's destroyed. Everything. [Gaston] No, not everything - [explosions] - [Conroy] Stubby, down! [whimpering] [Gaston] Come, my friends. Those are ours. [chuckles] We pay them back for this morning. I thought we were being attacked. [Gaston] You will soon know the difference between theirs and ours. [French music playing] [indistinct chatter] Et voilà. Here it is, your new home. Sweet dreams. - [whistle blowing] - [man] Get up now, everybody! Everybody, get up! - [Olsen] Come on, Conroy. - [whistle blowing] - [Stubby barks] - [Conroy groans] Now, let me sleep Stubby, just let me sleep a little bit more. Woof-woof. - Oh. Uh. Ah. Sorry. - Alright, get up now. Yeah, I'm up, I'm up. I'm up. I'm getting up. [birds chirping] Uh... Have you done this before? Don't worry, it will be fine. I've done this many times. Where did you find him? [Conroy] Oh. Uh... He was living rough. He joined us when we were training. He's not very beautiful. Oh. Pfft. Maybe not, but he's got real character. Just like me. I'm not the most beautiful, but I'm strong and lovable. [Conroy chuckles] Uh-huh. This is the place. We get a good view from here. [bird calling] What do you see? [soldiers speaking German] - Look. - [Stubby growling softly] It's gas. We need to sound the alarm. Let's go. [breathing through gas mask] - [Stubby barks] - [Conroy gasps] [growling] - [German soldier] Halt! - Run! Run! - [German] Stop! - [gunshot] - I said stop! Halt! - [gunshot] [gunshots continue] [horses whinnying] - The horses! Stay here! Stay! - Stay, stay! Come on! Stubby, go! Go tell them, Stubby, go! - [gunshot] - [panting] [speaking German] [barking] [barking and growling] What? Stubby? Okay! Gas! - Gas! - [ringing bell] Gas! - [indistinct shouting] - [barking] [man] Move it, move it, move it! Let's go, let's go! Get a move on! [snoring] - [grunting] - Oh. [gasps] [German soldier] Feuer! [birds chirping] - Hey, little dog. - [barking] [indistinct chatter] Oh. Oh, no. Gas? Gas! Look, gas! The dog is trying to warn us! Everybody, go inside and put on your masks! [barking continues] There he is! Stubby! [whimpering] [horses whinnying] Oh, no, we don't have a mask for him! What are we gonna do? - [horses whinnying] - [barking] Ah. There, there. Hold on. Wait. It's okay, Stubby. It's okay. Good boy. - You've done well. - Allez, calme-toi. Calme-toi. - [creaking] - [Stubby whimpering] It's okay. Shhh. Stubby, it's gonna be okay. Shhh. [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] [exclamations of relief] - Ça va? - Ça va. Hey! - Come here. Come here, boy. - [barks] Thank you from our whole village! His name is Stubby. Ah. Stubby. You are our hero, Stubby. [woman] Robert's letters were full of just how beloved Stubby was by everyone. [villagers speaking in French] - Merci. - Merci à toi. [woman] It was as if he lived every day through the heroics of this little canine wonder. [villager] Merci. Yeah, but they were so generous. Yes, yes, but no meat. - [rustling] - [rifles cocking] Mm, I think this war has just improved. Mm! Like a magician, I'm creating magic with a simple rabbit. [barks] Allez, Olsen. Now you throw the cochonnet. - The what? - This. Not too far, not too close. Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon. I explain. It must land within six to ten meters of the starting circle. Allez, Olsen, now you throw the cochonnet. - Okay. - You can do it, Olsen. Sacre bleu! Rends-nous le cochonnet! Give us the cochonnet, cabot! Sale petit chien! [laughing] Stubby... Drop it, Stubby. Drop it. Ah. Merci! No, Stubby, you can't take the cochonnet. Pétanque is a very serious business in this country. - War has started for less. - [Conroy sighs] Sorry. He just... he loves to play ball. Mm... Ta-dah. C'est prêt! [sniffing] Now we are ready to eat. [grumbling] [Gaston] Ah, excuse me for my bad manners. It's your rabbit, too, Stubby. Mm. Whoa! This... this is really good. Yes, is very tasty, huh? [chuckles] Even if I say myself. [exclaiming and laughing] - À moi le point! - Okay. Now, if you want to score the point, you see that ball there? Hit it hard. You know, we should take a little after-dinner stroll, while we still can. Yeah, sure. C'mon, Stubby. [grumbling] [squeaking] [whistles] Nice shot. - [barks] - [Conroy chuckles] Okay, alright. I have no tobacco, but I carry it everywhere with me. It was a present from my wife. I never showed you my family. - Wow, three girls. - Yes. Jeanne. She's 11. Manon, eight. And Madeleine, six. They capture my heart completely. They would love to play with you, Stubby. They would take you into the forest, chasing the sanglier. Yeah, sanglier. Uh, what... what are they? Wild pigs. You know, with the tusks. [Conroy] Oh. Oh, I get it. Your daughters chase wild pigs? [Gaston] Yes. One day, they will make fine hunters. [Conroy] Really? Uh... And what about you? Uh... [chuckles] My sister Margaret is like a mom to me and my two younger sisters. She cared for our mother before she passed, and my dad passed away when I was five. I do hope to have a wife and children one day. It is the best. My wife, Alice, she's, uh... how you say? ...nagging me all the time, but I wouldn't change her. [chuckles] - When did you last see them? - It is more than two years. Two years? Wow, that's a darned long time. Don't you ever get lonely? Yes. Well, sometimes. But now you Americans are here, it will be over soon, you know. Two kings! I win! [chuckles] Look, I have two kings! Ha-ha! I beat you, Yankee. Hold on a minute. Hold... hold on a minute. I have a flush, so... I won. Flush? Flush, flush, flush, flush, flush... What is this flush? Surely the kings are the kings, you know, the best! [groaning] So, um, before you were a soldier, what did you do? I'm a chef in my own restaurant. A good restaurant. Ah! That's why you're such a good cook. A real French chef cooking dinner for us, Stubby. What do you think of that, huh? This is how I learn my English. And you, what do you do? I work in a builder's hardware store, uh, selling screws and nails. It's not a great job, but... it's home. I miss it. We French make home wherever we are. It's about food, wine and good company. You know, on a night like this, we can forget about the war. We heard the attack and came as fast as we could! Where do you want us to be, Sergeant? We've beaten them back for now, but Clayborn is still somewhere out there. Gotta bring him in somehow. [man shouting] We got wounded! We got wounded! Coming through, guys, coming through! Mind your backs! Stretchers! - [Gaston] Stubby! - Come on, let's go! Where are you going, Conroy? [barks] [explosions] - [missiles firing] - [Stubby whimpering] [Conroy sighs] I can't see anything. [big explosion] Stubby! [whimpering] [explosion] [groaning] Oh... - Oh... - [barking] - [gunfire] - Get down! Smoke at 7-5-0 yards! - [barking] - Come on, go, go, go, go, go! [Margaret] I realized that every day spelled danger. There was no letup for our boys. [distant explosions] Out the way. Come on. We're coming through. - Go, go, go, go, go. - Come on. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be alright. It's alright. - You're gonna be fine. - Good boy. Come on. Out the way, everybody. Let's go. [Clayborn] Thank you, Stubby. [Margaret] I got word in April of 1918 that the Yankee Division was moving to a new battle sector at Seicheprey. [barking] [Olsen] Look... look at him! Mother! How that mutt survived, I'll never know. I was sure the Boche would get him. He is so lucky. [Schroeder] He's so brave. I wish I had half his courage. Courage? It's not courage. It's dumb luck. Believe me. - [woman] Monsieur? - Hey, Stubby. Monsieur Conroy, please. - Ow. Uh... - [chuckling] - Sorry. Hello, ma'am. - Hello. It is for Stubby. We made it for him to keep him warm and to say thank you for the day of the gas. Ah. Gee, thank you. Merci beaucoup. Stubby, what do you say to this nice lady? [barks softly] No, no, not like that. You know. [whining] [woman giggles] You are such a clever little dog, Stubby. Oh, I forgot. I have something for Stubby my sergeant made for him. [growling and barking] [Gaston] Don't be like that, my little friend. This will save your life. [growling softly] Thank you, Gaston. And thank you again, ma'am. Goodbye, Stubby and... Monsieur Conroy. - Take good care of yourselves. - We'll take care of one another. Oui, comme les Trois Mousquetaires. All for one... ...and one for all! [barks] Well, well, I think it's you she likes, Conroy, no? [chuckles] [Margaret] Robert, Stubby and Gaston spent the next few months in the Sibille trench, right in the path of the German advance as they desperately tried to move on Paris. Every soldier, cook and medic took part in the fight. I had no idea that Seicheprey would be described as the single largest American battle of World War One. And my poor kid brother and his dog were smack dab in the middle of it all. A welcome sight you are, Stubby. [chuckles] Whoa, whoa, whoa there, fella. [Conroy] I think he remembers you, Colonel, sir. Now, no more reconnaissance for the moment. The Germans are pressing us hard, so I need every man reinforcing the line. - Yes, sir! - À vos ordres, mon colonel. [muffled chatter] - [clicking] - [muffled chatter] [barking and growling] What is it? What's going on? What happened? Calm down. Calm down! [barking continues] [missiles whistling] - [barking] - [explosions] [shouting in German] [screaming] [shouting and screaming] - [groaning] - [barking] Come on, come on, come on. Conroy, watch out! - [soldiers shouting] - Come on, follow me. - [whistling] - [Stubby barks] [gunfire] Now let's set a trap for these rats. [growling] - [barking] - [Conroy] Stubby! [growling and barking] [whistles] Hande hoch! Drop your weapons! [Stubby growling] Kamerad! Kamerad. No, you are not my kamerad. You are my prisoner. Keep your hands up. [growling] Good work, my friend. I will take them now. Go. You're such a brave boy, you know that? It's not over, boys! Keep your eyes peeled! - [shell whistling] - They'll be back! Ah! [shell whistling] - [barks] - [screams] Stubby, no! [explosion] Stubby! Anybody hurt? Any wounded? - [Stubby whimpering] - [shell whistling] Stubby! Stubby. Stubby! Oh, come on. Stubby? You'll be okay. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. You'll be okay, you're gonna be okay. Come on. - [whimpering] - [explosions] Alright. Come on, Stubby! Please stay with me. Come on. Please stay with me. [exhales deeply] Schroeder, Schroeder, d'you see what that dumb dog did? He saved my life. - [man] We need a medic now! - D'you hear me, Schroeder? - [groaning] - Wounded man here! Quickly, we need help! Anybody! It's gonna be okay, boy. I promise. I promise. [indistinct shouting] Hey, Conroy. Stubby. Stubby, what have they done to you? Come on. - Doc! Doc, Stubby needs help. - That's a bad wound. I don't know if there's much we can do, and he's a dog, soldier. I'm sorry. He's my friend, he's one of us! He saved lives. Please. Please, Doc. Please. I'm sure the doctor will do his best. Right, Doc? Hm? Okay, okay. Just lay him on the ambulance. [whimpering] You come back soon, little dog. We need our third musketeer. Guys, make way! Move! Alright, hurry, hurry! - Schroeder? - [grunts] Let's keep moving, keep moving. Alright, get that, yes. Don't worry, Conroy. He's strong. Great day to... be an American, right, Stubby? - [whimpering] - [explosions] [Margaret] After Schroeder and Stubby were wounded, the fighting around Seicheprey had become ferocious. And the rains came down. It rained day after day after day, turning the whole place into a quagmire. - [thunder crashes] - [explosions] I can only begin to imagine how Robert missed Stubby. He must've felt totally lost without the little fella. [sighs] Come on, Conroy. I know it's hard, - but you must stay strong. - [explosion] - [men shouting] - German attack! Let's go! [Margaret] The Yankee Division was driven out of the Sibille trench and the town of Seicheprey. As the Germans desperately tried to reach Paris, all that stood between them and their prize were our boys. It was a real worrying time for us back home. They mean business. We need to stop them. [shell whistling] No, not now, Musketeer. Tomorrow. First, we need to rest. I miss him too, but I know the Three Musketeers will be together again very soon. I feel it. [sighs] You think? Yes. And the good thing is, we are out of those trenches, my feet are dry at last. All that mud and those rats... Argh. Dégueulasse. Baptiste? You've been ordered to return to your regiment camp. Grab your gear and move out. Stubby, Schroeder, and now you? So much for your predictions. You'll be fine. Before I leave, just take my advice. To stay alive, you need to feel fear. Fear? But you show no fear. You laugh! You mean this? [chuckles] It only protects my fragile heart. [chuckling] Farewell, my good friend. Until we meet again. Adieu. ♪ La Madelon vient Nous servir à boire ♪ ♪ Sous la tonnelle Elle frôle son jupon ♪ ♪ Et chacun lui raconte Une histoire ♪ ♪ Une histoire à sa façon ♪ Adieu, mon ami. [Margaret] After much hard fighting, our boys retook Seicheprey and drove the Germans back. It was not until much later that I learned just how fierce the battle had been. [Conroy] My dear sister Margaret, I hope you and the girls are keeping well. - I'm doing just fine. - [shell whistling] - [coughing] - [explosion] [clears throat] [sighs] Even the chow is okay. Well, not like your cooking, but pretty much most of it I can eat. [coughing] It's almost four weeks since Stubby got hit and there's still no news of him. I'm sure he's being taken real good care of. Gaston, Stubby and me, we called ourselves The Three Musketeers. You know, like in the book Mom read to us when we were kids? [clears throat] Well, the other day... Gaston was sent back to his regiment. [coughs] It's all going to be over soon, and then we'll be coming home. [coughing] I send my love to you all. - Your loving brother, Robert. - [shell whistling] [explosion overhead] [Margaret] Robert was always good at putting a brave face on, and I knew that was what he was doing. His two best friends gone, my heart went out to him. [coughing] [groaning] [panting] [whimpering] - [birds chirping] - [indistinct chatter] [grunts] [crows cawing] [whimpering] [sniffing] [speaking German] [sniffing] - Come on, Conroy, wake up. - [coughing] It's guard time. We'll miss chow. [coughing] Conroy? - [rasping] - Oh, no. Quick, we need a doctor! My buddy is real sick! [speaking German] [clattering] - Was? - Ein hund! - [speaking German] - [gunshot] He's the fifth soldier this week. I don't know what it is. Just gotta keep an eye on him. He's too sick to move. But he is gonna make it, right, Doc? I don't know. Maybe... maybe not. [Margaret] In 1918, the whole world was seized by a deadly flu epidemic, and Robert caught it too. It spread through our boys like a poison cloud. [gasps] I gotta get out there and fight. I need to get up. We're good, Conroy. We're good, we're good. [whimpering] Everything's good. The Boche are real quiet. Just get better. Mm... Stubby. Where's... Stubby? Just let him rest. That's the only thing he can do now. [whimpering] [groaning] [whimpering] [mumbling] I... I need to fight. [groaning] [whimpering] [growling] [sighing] [rustling] [rustling] [rustling] [groans] [barks] [barks softly] [indistinct chatter] [Margaret] I was so happy to hear that Robert was on the mend, and that he and Stubby were reunited. And good news! After six months of hard fighting, he and Stubby went on a furlough to Paris. Never imagined my first trip to Paris would be in a cattle wagon. So glamorous! [Margaret] I remember thinking, maybe this dreadful war was finally coming to an end. You're gonna have to lay down at some stage. [whistling] Room for one more? - Hey, buddy, you made it! - [Conroy] Schroeder! - Stubby, look, he's back! - [barks] Stubby, you're here! What happened to you? Hello? Why is it always about Stubby? I found him. "Thank you, Olsen, for finding Stubby. Oh, that was great!" Sorry, Olsen. Come here! [indistinct shouting] [hooves clopping] [Conroy] This looks nice. [giggling] - What do you think, Stubby? - [barks] - You coming, Schroeder? - Yep, I'm with you! [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [Margaret] In the beginning, the French were very suspicious of Americans, but by the fall of 1918, they loved us. - [exclamations of approval] - [man] Bravo! [woman] Bravo aux Américains. Thank you. Thank you very much. [man] Bravo aux Américains! Merci. Thanks. Come on, let's go see Paris! What are we waiting for? [aircraft buzzing overhead] [Margaret] By September of 1918, we were told that the war was coming to an end, and that the German army was in retreat. [growling] - What is it, Stubby? - [sniffing] [growling] [whispering] Stubby. Stubby, come back. [distant gunfire] [sniffing and growling] - [barks] - [gasps] [screams] No! [grunts] - [guns cocking] - Don't even think about it. This is yours now, Stubby. You earned it. [mumbling in German] Well, look what Stubby sniffed out. [speaking German] ...kamerad! - [Olsen] Move it! - No! - [coughing] - [growling] - Come on. - [Stubby barks] [Colonel] We are here today to mark the courage of a very brave solider, who went above and beyond the call of duty. Private First Class Conroy and Stubby, post! For his capture of a German spy in Marcheville, I confer the honorary rank of Sergeant on Stubby, the regimental mascot. From this day forward, Sergeant Stubby will wear these stripes. And for you, Private Conroy, today you are Corporal Conroy. Hey, Stubby, you outrank me now. [barks] [clapping and cheering] Gaston! For the newspapers back home! Say cheese! [Margaret] The newspaper headlines all talked about a final attack on the German Hindenburg line. After the return of his friends, Robert's letters were cheery and full of good humor. He even told me a funny story about how Stubby came face-to-face with a strange new beast of war. [barking] [growling] Okay, Sergeant, I'm Captain George S. Patton of the United States Tank Corps. Let's go. We've got a war to win. That's my boy. [indistinct shouting] [shouting in German] [shouting in German] [scoffs] I can't believe it. The Germans built this like they were going to stay forever. The Boche build palaces and we had to live in those puddles? It's over, it's over! Did you hear? The war is over! The Germans are signing an armistice. - Says who? - What are you talking about? It's true! The war is to end tomorrow! Hey, did you hear that, Stubby? - [barking] - [cheering] [Sergeant] Hold on, hold on there, soldiers! Cease-fire doesn't start till 11 a.m.! - [man] Germany surrendered! - When is it over? We have a war to fight! You know, guys, when I get home, I'm gonna find myself a wife. I thought you were going to wait until you found a job. Nah, after all we've been through, I'm ready for some home life. Me, too. Can't wait to introduce Stubby to my sisters. I've been away so long, I worry my girls will not recognize me. [sighs] Why can't we just leave now? Just think, one last push and we're all going home. Well, little buddy, we're nearly there. Just a few more hours and... it'll all be over. [sighs] [Margaret] Robert and Stubby spent their last night of the Great War huddled together under an oak tree. A man and his dog, unselfish friends, comrades in arms. - [whistle blowing] - [all shouting] [sniffing] - [speaking German] - [Gaston] Drop your weapons! [gasps] [Stubby barks] - [Conroy grunts] - [Stubby barks] - [growling] - [gun cocks] [barking and growling] - [growling] - [bugle playing fanfare] [distant cheering and whistling] [growling and barking] Thank you, my friend. [Margaret] I never did understand why our boys were made to attack until the very last minute of the war. So many young men were lost on that morning, but they did their duty... to the very end. We made it. [chuckles] [barking] [indistinct shouting] [sniffing] [Schroeder] Olsen! [whimpering] Olsen! Olsen, where are you? Where are you? [horse whinnying] Well, my friends, we have seen much together, and now the Three Musketeers must say goodbye. Stubby! Yes, good boy. My friend Olsen gave these to me. I will always think of him when I play poker. Take this and think of us. Goodbye, Yankees, and thank you all. [engine starts] - All for one! - And one for all! - [applauding] - [barking] Vive la France! Vive les États-Unis! [cheering] - We're so proud of you! - Welcome! - Welcome home, boys. - Welcome back! Great job. It's so nice to have you back! Robert! [woman] A hero! You're a hero, Stubby! [barks] [journalist] Stubby, look into the camera! And... hold it right there. Subtitles by explosiveskull
