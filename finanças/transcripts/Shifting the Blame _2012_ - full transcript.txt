PAL SPEED Hey! Stop... Get going, man! Now! Turn right over there! Now you're gonna get us 500. You got that? Yes. If you try to fuck with me, I'm gonna get you! Got it? Let's go! It's all cool, it's all going by plan. Give it to... Fucking hell! Stupid Bitch! I said don't fuck with me! SHIFTING THE BLAME Benji... I didn't expect you to let the cops fuck you. What are you in for? What's wrong? Don't you talk to your friends anymore, sucker? See you tomorrow, Benji! What happened? Nothing. I fell. Is this the last one for today? The fourth. That's all the new ones. Thank you. What's your problem, man? I don't talk to social workers. I know all your bullshit tactics, I know exactly what you want to hear. And? What do I want to hear? You want to know how I see my future, eh? That kind of loser shit, man! Feelings and all that gay shit... Just fuck off! A hold-up at a gas station, robbery, assault on the station attendant. Keep talking... Talk to the wall, man! Leave me alone! Secondly: A waitress refused to serve you. You broke her upper jaw. Additionally, four cases of shoplifting... - Fuck you! What happened to your face, Benjamin? Why didn't you defend yourself? I believe it's about time you start taking responsibility for your life. Okay. Okay. So? What's your plan? Social worker, I don't talk to you, man! That's my plan! You could get out. I don't talk to social workers, man! Okay, what about getting out? Open prison. All right, fuck off! I'm not gonna be a faggot, man! Out! Okay. NO WALLS OR FENCES Wrong direction! Tobi will help you adjust. He's the highest ranking of the group... Got it. Learn a bit from him, do it for my future. No problem. He's your buddy and you follow his lead! Give me your bag. I need to check it. - Fuck off, faggot! Save that for jail! Here, we don't hurt anyone, in words or actions. Go fuck yourself, man! - Did you understand what I just said? Did you understand me? - Yeah, man. Here. That's "Waldhaus" rule No. 1: No verbal insults, no swear words. And no physical contact. Don't touch me again. You hear me? Is that all? - Yeah. We keep tabs on each other. That's how it works around here. BEST OF THE MONTH So you're the nerd around here? Man, what a sorry place. These are the house rules. You have to memorize them. Tobi will go through them with you. You'll need to know them in your sleep. Fucked-up social worker shit! Hey, we confront in order to help... - Fuck you! Unless you want to go back to jail, you'll follow our rules, Benjamin! So would you pick up the folder, please? That one! TV? There isn't one. And no computer games. The computer is only for school, writing applications and stuff. What about jerking off? Alex, did you get any remarks? - Yes, I was late for work. Always look at the person speaking. - Further remarks? - None. Consequences? - My girlfriend can't visit on the weekend. Anybody else know anything about Alex? Okay. Hey guys, this is Ben, the new guy. Emre. Samir, what's up? That's Alex, that's Steffen. What'll you do on leave this weekend? - He's gonna fuck, what do you think, moron? Don't talk like that. What'll the new guy think? What? That's how it is. He's gonna fuck, right? Pull yourself together! You guys just don't get a joke right? Jews... Say what? - You get minus points for each misconduct. If you cooperate, you'll move up the ladder, like me. Then you can leave on the weekend. I'm a Tiger. That's the highest rank. - Tiger? Who's gonna explain it? Steffen is a rookie, like you. For 3 months now. No sweater. Next level is a Wolf candidate, grey sweater. Samir is a Tiger candidate, that's green. So you're a Wolf, yeah? And you're a red Tiger? What is this, a petting zoo? You'd like that, wouldn't you? Fuck you, man! - Hey! Watch your mouth! Cigarette break is over! Dude, such a lame joke! - Enjoy your meal! Thank you. I think that's enough. Hey, it's not worth it, man. - What? I'm not aggressive or anything. Everything's okay. Drink your tea, Benjamin. If you stay, you get no sugar for your next 10 cups. So enjoy it. And you'll write an essay: "How do I express my dislike without swearing?" I need to piss! - At least one page. Just remember, you're being rated at all times. We need to get up early tomorrow. It was tough for me too at first. Well... Time's short, you have no free time. And then there's the social training. The what? Social training. It's part of the program. It's about your offender-victim reconciliation. Damn! If I get one weekend off, I'm gonna fuck someone up out there. He's out on probation, that Jew! Denis the penis! We were a team. Muggings, no problem! We always delivered the cars properly. And then that thing at the gas station... Listen up, dude. We don't talk about our crimes. Got it? Night. How much longer is your semester break? Come on, Ben. Push it! Until April, then the Bachelors thesis, then I'm done. Cool. Did you hit on me? You fucking faggot! Come on! - What? Will you calm down now! Calm down! Wasn't the first time. I just wanted to hold on, man! Pack your bags, Steffen. You had your chance. Samir, Emre. Man, you fucked up! I just wanted to hold on. - We have our rules for a reason. When we say no physical contact, we mean it! Okay! What's wrong here? Where are the mistakes? Or the mistake? Maybe there's only one. A typical question in job interviews. Only if you're applying to Porsche, though. - Could happen, couldn't it? You don't write "technique" with a "k". Very good, Samir. Is anything else incorrect? "Job guarantee". There's no such thing! You don't have enough strength or what? Maybe. Thank you. What are your hobbies? Mine? I like to fuck. Dope. Cars. Do you know anything about cars? That's a Ford. Hey, come on! Eva's back! Hello guys! - Hi Eva. Ben... This is Eva, my wife. Your housemother. Welcome to your new family! - I'm Sarah! Do you know how old I am? I'm this old! Come on. Let's help Mariana with the bags. 15 more seconds! What's up? Nothin'. Time's up, get out! He's right: Eva's tits are much better than Mariana's. Mariana doesn't have any. Shut up, Samir. Damn, show some respect! That's how it is! - Hey, Ben! Not on your own! Really nice Momma tits. That's how it is, right? You wait until I'm finished. Got it? Ben, tomorrow you start at the construction site, helping Tobi. You'll be assisting, but I don't want to hear you complain, okay? Here are your work clothes. I always thought this room was the nicest. Especially in summer, when everything's green outside. Well, you'll see. Good night. - Night. Tobi. How are you? Good. The four weeks did me well. Now, I can get back to work. Did you miss me? No, what makes you think that? And Mariana is reading a story to Sarah? If not, she's going to get a helpful 'remark'. Rule No. 150: Never disturb your house parents when they haven't seen each other in four weeks. Rule No. 151: We are going to be quiet now. You broke a 55-year-old woman's jaw. What do you think of that? You think it's great, right? - Did you feel sorry for her? She could've died, man. Or be in a wheelchair. Beating, that's all you're capable of, eh? "With the bass in your face!" Use your own words. - Did you feel sorry for her? At least a bit? Did you think of your Grandma? Yeah, 'cause his Grandma's a scumbag just like him! No personal insults! That's going too far! Did you hear that? No personal insults! Feelings are respected here! That's the pussy bullshit we do, right? When she was on the ground, you hit her again. How often? How many times? - No idea, man. I don't believe you! How many times? - Till you got a hard-on? How many times? Three times. I think. Do you feel sorry for her now? Do you feel anything? So, you don't care at all? Then say that you don't give a damn about her! Man, I don't talk to social workers. Tell us that you don't give a shit. Say it! I just wanted something to drink, man! She refused: "No more drinks. You're drunk!" She was talking about closing up. I just reacted! I'm the customer, I have a right! The others are always to blame, right? - Yeah. Then repeat after me: "The others are always to blame, and I don't care if I broke her jaw!" The others are always... - Louder! - You don't feel anything, do you? The others are... - Louder! Come on! The fucking bastards are always to blame, they fuck you over and are never there for you. I don't care. I don't give a fuck about that woman. We need those. Put them all in. Well, what are you two doing there? Daddy, this will be a cake with a lot of chocolate. Mmm, delicious! - I'll get the candies! That got a little bit out of hand, I know! Especially for his first "hot chair". Take all the time you need. You don't have to rush back into things yet. At least not that way. I found them! The other way! Always with the grain. Otherwise, you'll damage the wood. Yesterday in the "hot chair"... Respect. You kept your cool! Didn't you say that cars are... Why do you ask? I just thought that you might have heard about some robberies, in the industrial areas in Stuttgart? Maybe you've heard... No, I haven't! Sorry. Anyway, if you have any other questions, you come to me. Let's turn it around and do the edges. Come on! Nothing? Still nothing new? Thank you. Good bye. This photo was taken in 1984. I was only in first grade. So it's been a while. On the left is Pope John Paul II. The man on the right is the guy who fired four bullets at him. The Pope forgave him while he was still in the hospital. That's crazy. - Man, he wanted to kill him! Forgive him? Only the Pope could do that. I couldn't! But the Pope ain't nothing special. He's only human! Besides, the Vatican is full of criminals and child molest... - Samir! We're talking about something else right now. This is the picture of a... you could say, offender-victim reconciliation. Somebody is reaching out to a person who tried to kill him. If you feel genuine regret, then you have a real chance that the victim will forgive you. You show your regret and offer to make amends. That's what's most important for an offender-victim reconciliation. Might be a stupid question, but something happened to you too, Eva. The attack in your car. Do you want reconciliation? Emre, this isn't about Eva. But it's not a stupid question. It doesn't apply in my case. They never caught the perpetrators. Let go! Yeah man! Go, go, go! Yeah Tobi! Yo Ben! I'm heading out. - Have a nice weekend. And don't cause trouble, okay? - Wolf candidate! Fuck! You're good with cars, right? Please take a look! You're pretty late today! Were you with your guy? Wouldn't you like to know? I'm trying to become a Tiger. Then I can get out for the weekend. Have you ever been in a seaplane? Have you? - Nope. You can do that at Lake Constance. My mom knows a pilot there. Hello! Come on in, it's cold! So what? Does it need repair? Yeah. The distributor cap has a little crack. When water gets in it'll short out. I'll take you along! Seaplane - it's awesome. Mommy. I had a bad dream. It's okay. It's okay. Do you think you can handle this? Why shouldn't I be able to handle it? What are you saying? Sit on the other chair! Let's go! I'm sorry, Benjamin. Sit down! I'm sorry I pulled your chair away. I hope you didn't hurt yourself? What do you feel when I apologize? Are you apologizing because you set me up? How would you feel about that? - Fucked up. If you do that and then apologize, it doesn't make it all good again. What should I have done differently? What would you do in order to apologize to the woman whose jaw you broke? That wasn't on purpose! Not like you just did. Do you want the woman to forgive you? - She never would. In court, she cried the whole time, because she was afraid of me. Forgiveness doesn't come easily! I bet you can forgive. I would try to forgive, yes. I'd try to, if that asshole would at least turn himself in! Sorry about that expression. But, two of them, against one woman, fantastic! But... if they'd turn themselves in, if they would show regret... then it would be possible, I think. Let's continue tomorrow, okay? Punctuality: B. Tidiness of your room: C. And checking my car gets you an extra point for effort. Come on! Actually, I wanted to ask you something. - What's up? Offender-victim reconciliation. I have a question too... What are your plans for when you get out? Cars? I have no idea, I really don't. You? When the internship is over? Then comes my Bachelors thesis, and then... I don't know. Sometimes all the psychos get on my nerves. Like me? - Nah, don't worry. Social workers are often the worst psychos. What did you want to ask me? Oh, yeah, uh... It's about Eva. What happened to her... Did she get over it okay? Well... as well as she could. It was pretty bad. She was in her fifth month. What? In the attack, someone kicked her really bad. He aimed very well... Eva lost her child. Mariana! I'm coming. What is this? I never saw this, how could you... Do you think you're the only one who's hurting? Is that what you think? Can't you sleep? Is something wrong, Ben? Fuck! Hey, you pussy! There's no running away! You pussy! Not with me! You won't mess it up for me! I'm taking you to Niklas! Let me go, man! What is this shit? How will you explain this shit to Niklas? Let me go, man! Tell me what's up, man! Let me go! I can't stay, and I can't explain it to you either, man! Were you... Were you involved in that? Are you crazy? Shit! You attacked Eva? Man, are you insane? How long do you think it'll take? Two, three days and they'll lock you up, man! I'm not going back to jail, man! - Then stay! It's working, man! I can't! Do you think I'd rat on you? - What? There's nothing to rat on. You didn't see she was pregnant, eh? We all did some fucked-up shit! Hey, man. It's okay! Hey, faggot-ass Turk, three minutes are up! If you want to jerk off then hurry up! Hey, dude! What's up with you, fucking Nazi!? Samir! Alex! Both of you are downgraded! Tobi, what's with your forehead? Did you guys have a fight or what? I had a bad dream and hit my head. I can confirm that. It woke me up. I'm gonna get you! Is everything okay? I'm gonna get you! POLICE RECORD Hey, Ben! Come here! He'll take care of it. So? Wow, they did a bad job! You need to go back to the garage. Send them my greetings, but... You've got something there. Where? - Further down. Get it off! They just put duct tape on the crack. You need a new distributor cap and new wiring and stuff. I wrote applications! - Cool. Then give it your best shot! You need to be a Wolf to get out for an internship. - I know. Gotta go! Why do you think you should be promoted? Because I participate. I do all the jobs that need to be done. I learn new things while doing that. I've learned to set goals, for example. What kind of goals? For example, one of my goals is to come to grips with my aggression. So that I don't just act, but think before I act. And... the internship in the garage is another goal. So you want to be promoted for that? - Yes. So, I can get out and visit someone and stuff. Of course, you can only do that as a Tiger. But good goals. Respect. Okay. We'll call you back in. What do you think? - I think he's doing well. He took a look at my car, he does a decent job cleaning, social behavior is positive. Well, construction work isn't his thing. But he gives it his best. True. Tobi, what do you think? Well... How do you like it here with us? Good. I'm glad you've hung on! - We're ready now. Please come back in. Congratulations, Alex. You're a Wolf again. Samir, second attempt as a Tiger candidate. Cool, thank you! Ben, you'll remain a Wolf candidate for now. Please sit down. Say what? Why? I have good ratings! Calm down. We'll explain why you can't become a Wolf. Yeah, I can't wait to find out! - Not in that tone of voice! I just... - Which rule is that? I just want to know why I didn't advance. - Rule No. 11. "We accept confrontation and criticism." Sit down, please! What the fuck happened in there? Why didn't I get promoted? Why didn't you do something, man! Don't talk to me like that! Who covered your ass? As long as you keep hitting on Mariana, nothing will happen. You'll stay down! Got that? Got that, man? Is that the reason? Nothing happened, you pussy! One more "pussy", and I'll tell Eva that you kicked her little one to death! What do you think about that, man? I'll cover for you. WEEKLY GRADING, BENJAMIN GRAF Ben really did a good job with his application! Is something wrong? No, why? Just asking... I'll forward it to the garage, okay? Yes. Does anybody know anything about Ben? - Yes, I do. Ben lost his temper over the "Waldhaus" council decision. He took it out on me and used swear words! Emre, would you explain? Later, if your boss makes a decision you don't like, you gotta stay calm! You need to respect and accept what people tell you. We meet others with politeness and dignity. Tobi, did you get any remarks? - No. Consequences? - None. Does anybody know anything about Tobi? Good. The feedback-session is over. Please, listen up for a moment! Mariana is going to do some interviews for her final paper. Who do you need? I'd like to begin with Samir. When is it my turn? - Not at all. Two o'clock is Samir. At six o'clock is my second interview with Ben. No, that won't work. Sorry. You're after Samir. That's it. Back to work! Damn it, what should I do? Think of something! Benjamin! We need a second grill for Tobi's barbecue. You're coming with me to get it! I'm a Wolf candidate. I'm not allowed... - Doesn't matter! The youth center is to the left, okay? To the left? Not much going on, eh? Hey Ben! It's your turn for the interview now! May I? Samir, would you please help me? - Yeah, sure! Is this okay? Perhaps you could introduce yourself first. Who are you, Ben? I'm... Benjamin Graf, born on the 11th of October... That's all I know. That's good. Is Ben with Mariana? Yes, they're doing the interview. And how was it? Wasn't that bad. All cool. You ran away from home at 14. After that you were in a juvenile home, right? Would you rather talk about outside? What's your plan for after the "Waldhaus"? - I don't know! I have no idea if I'll ever manage. I just don't know. Hand me a chisel, please! - Get it yourself! What's your problem, Tobi? We'll try it with the chisel. Go over to the workshop and get it! Now get moving. What's wrong? Fucker! You fucking cunt. Please leave the private area right now! It was Ben! What? He mugged you! He's the one they didn't catch! He was the one who kicked you in the stomach. What are you talking about? - It's true! Tobi, this is not how it works! You can't just tell lies about anyone because you have a problem with them! He told me! Do you have evidence? He told me. When? Don't know. Three weeks ago?! And why did you keep it to yourself for three weeks? OK, Tobi. I'll take care of it. I don't want you talking about this to anybody, understand? Do you understand? - Yes. Leave! Man, that took a while. I couldn't find it right away. Mariana! This soup is awesome! Really good soup! Ben's going for an offender-victim reconciliation. Not bad, eh? Cool, man. Congrats, Ben! Not many come so far in such a short time. He's well prepared. The appointment is at three. Sit down! She should be here any moment. Do you remember how often you kicked me in the stomach? Do you remember how often you kicked me? Four times. Good guess! What did you do on that day? With the money and the car? What did you do? We delivered the car. And the money? Went to a club, had some drinks. So you partied, eh? Got drunk. Did some coke. Sure, it was a success! What a brilliant accomplishment. Two men against one woman! Eva, that was... - Silence! The victim always speaks first. You know that! Always listen! Do you want to know what I did on that day? I said, do you want to know what I did? Yes. Eventually, a car stopped. I asked the driver to contact Niklas. Then we went to the police. Back at home, I thought it wasn't that bad. The pain was almost gone. The guys were very concerned. But that night, the bleeding started. We went to the hospital right away. When the doctor told me my unborn child was dead, I couldn't believe it! Okay. Stop it! - I thought: This can't be real! But it was real! My baby was real! And then it wasn't anymore. Then, all it was was a small, lifeless... thing! And a lot of mucus and blood! - Eva, stop it, please! I didn't know that it was a boy yet. It wasn't on purpose! I didn't know about the baby. I didn't plan things to be that way. I'm sorry. Seriously. I want to make amends. You let her go to kindergarten like this? I can get dressed on my own. I'm big already! What's going on here? There wasn't anybody there at three, right? At Ben's offender-victim reconciliation. The woman changed her mind? We have to respect that. Eva, talk to me! We can work through this. You weren't the one that got mugged. And he wasn't in your tummy! Ben, pass! Dude, your three minutes are up. Man, what's this faggot bullshit?! Get out! Come on, Ben! Morning, Ben! You cool? Ben, come over to the feedback session. Hurry up! Be quiet! Ben, do you have any remarks? No. - Consequences? None. Does anybody else know anything about Ben? Yes. I do. It was my fault that Eva lost her child. I kicked her. I am sorry... I'm so sorry, but that doesn't make it better. I'm going back to jail. You fuck! Into the house, all of you! Immediately! Are you deaf? You knew?
