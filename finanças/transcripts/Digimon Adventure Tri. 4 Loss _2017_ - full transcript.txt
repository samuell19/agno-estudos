Light is born of darkness... Darkness sails north to become water... Light sails south to give birth to fire... Wind flows in between light and darkness...

Each trait equally influences each other as it changes to its next form. However, what happens to those who could not receive any influence? Mei-Chan... Are you crying? Mei-Chan... Hey, what are you doing here? You guys are called humans, right? Why are you here? You guys, that's dangerous! But I don't think they're bad people. Hey, hey, how do you guys know us? What do humans eat? Hey, hey! Why? How? W-Wait a minute. I can't understand if you speak all at once. Looks like you haven't changed. I gotcha! Don't eat me! I won't eat you! After all, we're partners. Partners... What's that? Tanemon... What...? Oh, nothing... Nice to meet you. I'm Hikari. Hikari Yagami. You smell like this whistle. It's a nice calming scent. Yokomon? Where are you Yokomon? Ouch!! Oh! S-Sorry! I'm so sorry, Yokomon! Hey, stop! I'm suffocating! Stop it! Release me! Yokomon... What? Um... Me and you were partners. Do you remember? You know, you were always a baby, so you stuck to me like glue. We went to eat Monjayaki and to hot springs. We were always together, remember? Liar! I don't know any of that. Yokomon... No good. It won't connect. And the gate has completely disappeared, too. The Digital World itself must be unstable right after the reboot. What's a reboot? Can you eat it? Not sure. What could it be? Koshiro-San, you really know many difficult things. There're many things I don't know. That's why I want to know more. About you guys. About this world too. W-What?! The infection's gone. What's that? Nothing. Anyways, Tokomon. Let's become friends! Friends? Yeah. I wanna be with you. Okay! And? What's after this? We either find a way home or wait until we get rescued by Himekawa-San. Either way, we'll need to find some food and a place to sleep. Plus, the Digimons are still small. It's alright. We'll be alright! We got home last time, so we'll come through! No worries in my eyes! Right? Like in your eyes too, Tane! Huh? What? You just go with the flow! Jeez. I got to teach you all over how to go with the flow again. Mimi-Chan... We were finally able to meet again. That's enough for now! Don't eat me! I told you I won't eat you! Meicoomon?! Who's that? How? Why's she still in Adult form? Mei... She's not here? You remember Meiko-Chan... Mei! Mei!! Taichi! The distortion... Why? "NO NEW MESSAGES" Ta-da! What is this? Is this food? I've never seen anything like this. It smells good! Everyone's surprised. You made all of this, Sora-San? Yeah, since everyone was always hungry before. Wow! Whoever becomes your husband is lucky! Stop saying stupid things and help me serve the food. Ooh, what is this slightly bitter drink here? It's Oolong tea. Ah, it's pretty good. Right? Oolong tea is made from fermented tea leaves. A plant component called Oolong Tea Polymerized Polyphenol... ...reduces the absorption of fats as well as helps break them down. It is very popular as a health product. See, doesn't Oolong tea go with any type of food? Yes, I could endlessly drink this. Right, this bitter and refreshing taste goes with oily or strongly-flavored food. First of all, the "long" in Oolong tea stands for... I understand how much you love this. And about the tea leaves... It's tasty! Can I eat that too? No, that's for Koshiro-San. So here. Aww, but those look more yummy... ...to be a very healthy tea... Koshiro-San. If you continue talking, Tokomon will eat all your food. Oh, Motimon, I would like to hear more about this world from you... Okay, okay. Leave the rest for later. Sora-San took her time to make all this food. Here, say ahh! Uh! C'mon, if you don't open up you can't eat it! I-I can feed myself! Wait, what is this by the way? It's Sora-san's cooking with jelly beans and whip cream! I've been into this lately. It's so good, have some everyone! What a unique topping. Everyone too, say ahh! Is this really good? Yum! Yum! I can't believe everything in the past is all gone now. Can't it go back somehow? Well, it's not like they just forgot. Meicoomon remembered Mochizuki. Meicoomon was crying. Shouldn't we go on a search? Will we... ...be able to save Meicoomon? Meicoomon and Mochizuki are one of us! I know. Taichi! This slippery long stuff is really good! Real yummy! You... Don't talk with your mouth full! What's this food called? I think I like it! Don't you like anything if it's edible? Hmm, that may be true. You like Yakiniku, Takoyaki, and burgers too. And you always ate all my food too. Yaki...? I dunno what you're talking about. My bad. Well, it just means... ...I know you better than you do! Ooh! They're doing something fun! Me too! Me too, me too! Me three! Hikari. Me too. I want that too. Sure, come here. Okay! Are the meatballs good? Yeah. Really! Then I have lots more. Here! I don't need that much. Y-You're right... I'm sorry. I'm currently unable to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. It's Nishijima. I currently cannot locate Meiko Mochizuki. She hasn't returned home either. If you know anything, please contact me. Any response from Himekawa-San? It's no use, I can't contact Gennai-San either. This world is no mistake strange somehow. We don't know anything, just like before. What should we do now? Let's find Meicoomon. Taichi... Meicoomon and Mochizuki are both one of us. I want to make sure they reunite. So the problem is Meicoomon's infection and the distortions. If Meicoomon is the same as before even after rebooting... The infections could start again. Are you saying this was all for nothing? The reboot and how everyone lost their memories?! Well... Let's search. Our friend's crying. We got to save her. Yeah. I don't know how much we can do, but let's bring her back to her partner. To Mochizuki's side. Okay! It's decided. Let's get rolling again! We need to secure our base first. Walking around randomly like before isn't very productive. Let's find a safe place to sleep first. You sound like the old Joe-San now. I believe I've grown up somewhat. You do have a "girlfriend" too. You guys don't believe me! Alright, then let's go. Hey! Wake up, Koro... Huh?! What's wrong? Wait, what?! Hi! I can fly! I can too! Tentomon! Patamon! Patamon? Oh, so I'm called Patamon! Do I look pretty? Super pretty! You look fantastic, Palmon! Much obliged! Hikari! Stop staring so much, it's embarrassing. Gomamon, you evolved. Well, it's more like... We stuffed ourselves to sleep and evolved just like that, right? Just like that... But compared to you guys, we're still tiny. We wanna grow bigger. Yup! Looks like we'll be able to get by okay even after the reboot. Glad you're able to fly again. I told you, I don't know about that past! Biyomon. Mei... Mei... Where are you? Why...? Why won't you come? Meiko! Welcome back. How was it? It pops in and out. No clue. Meicoomon was always nearby where there was a big distortion. And the distortions continue to exist in this world now. If we trace the distortions, it shouldn't be that difficult to find Meicoomon. We got no choice but to search, huh? Don't push yourself too much. "To: Meimei" "We're exploring the Digital World! We'll bring Meicoomon back home." "SENDING MESSAGE" "ERROR: No Service Message failed to send" Of course, it won't connect. Maybe I shoulda forced Meimei to come too. I don't know. I think it'd be harsh for a normal girl like her here. Probably. What do ya mean "normal"? We are also your "normal" everyday girls here! W-Well, yeah... But we've all been to the Digital World before, right? Mochizuki-San probably never has. You know, she seems kind of helpless. Really... What's wrong? You wanna know? Don't worry, my number one will always be you-know-who. Right? Don't get me involved. Aren't you glad, big bro? Shut up! We might need more wood. What's bothering you? Why does it matter? The food earlier was real good. C'mon, what's wrong? Stupid. Wait! Agumon?! What the heck are you doing?! Huh? What? Weird. I thought I caught a lot of fish... A dream? Jeez, how hungry are you? I dunno... Sora? Sora! Sorry, Agumon. Head back without me. And that's the story. Missing?! Officer Himekawa is? Hey, did I do something wrong? That never changes with you. Can't you read the situation? I don't know! Do you know what to do in times like this? Should we ask Takeru? I can hear you. Hey, cheer up. What do you mean? You don't even know why I'm upset. Why are you upset? I don't know myself. What a pain. Well sorry, I'm a big pain! Hey... chill out! You two sure can't read the situation! You guys have bad timing and always fight! Everyone only thinks about themselves! They've never even thought of what I think... ...or how I feel. No one... ...does. I could never understand how you feel, Sora. You're always in people's business, but you solve your own problems and never talk about it. Well, maybe that's the good part about you though. What about you? Please take care of yourself more. Take care... of myself? Not possible, huh. But, that's one of your good points. But you're the number one person I care about! Don't say something like Biyomon... Sora...? Meicoomon?! Machinedramon... Sora!! Seriously...? Yamato, let's go after Meicoomon! Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! What is that huge thing? I have a bad feeling about it. Everyone, let's run! But, Taichi and them aren't... I'll go find them! There's no time for that! We got to hurry and run or it'll destroy us! I'm scared... Someone help! Everyone, calm down! I'm sure Taichi and them are fine, so... Mei! Meicoomon?! Mei! Mei!! Everyone! Taichi! Mei, why you aren't here? Why did you leave me by myself? Agumon, evolve! Huh? Gabumon! Please... Tentomon! W-Wait a minute! Suddenly saying "please" won't really... Dammit! No way... It looks like we can't evolve any further at this point. Biyomon! Biyomon, where are you?! Biyomon! Classified information on the Digital World... The current locations of the Digimons after reboot? What is this? Hime-Chan. Here, it's cocoa. It's a reboot. If this is possible, I'm sure I could see Tapirmon again. A Digi-Egg can't be reborn. They told you, remember? When the 4 Sovereigns were born, Tapirmon was... Sacrificed. He'll never turn back into a Digi-Egg again. That's why a reboot is the only way. After I graduate next year, I'm going to study it as much as... Stop. What? Huh? W-What? Why not stop already? I can't bear to watch. It's too painful to see. Can't it be me? Your new partner? You've been watching too much TV. Well... I don't mind trying it. Whaaa...?!! Gennai... "If we use Meicoomon, a reboot may be possible." "If you cooperate with Ygdrasil, I will provide your info in return." "Confidential." Ygdrasil? Who's there? I call myself... ...Hackmon. This place... Where's everyone? Biyomon! Biyomon! Wait! Why? Why're you following me? Because I'm worried. Liar, you just don't want to be alone. No! Then why don't you find someone else? Biyomon! Why don't you understand?! Well 'cause I don't know who you are! Biyomon... You're annoying! Huh?! Huh?! Meiko-Chan...? Sora-San? Why... Where am I? Hey! Everyone! Agumon! Hikari! Ya... Yamato-kun... Yamato-kun? Is it okay to call him by just his name? Taichi! Salamon?! Hikari! Are you okay?! Taichi... Salamon... I'm glad you're okay... Hikari! Where's everyone? I dunno. Machinedramon disappeared all of a sudden. A weird hole appeared in front of us, and when I woke up, I was with Taichi. You call me by just my name. A weird hole... Is it a distortion? Probably. We were saved thanks to it. Is everyone else okay? No way. Why here? This is... You're...! We were just in the forest and Machinedramon was there too... Weird. I know, it's a dream! Agumon, this hurts. It's not a dream. What should we do, Yamato-San? I-It's ready. Amazing... Where did you learn that? It's nothing really. I used to play in the mountains a lot back home. With Mei-Chan. We saw Meicoomon. She was looking for you. She remembers me?! I'm so glad. I'm sorry. Don't be. Everyone's waiting. Everyone was worried about you. A lot. Sora-San? Here, is this enough? Thank you, Biyomon. Hey, do you wanna eat together? No, I don't. I see. Come, don't say that. It's a lot warmer over here, and I want to talk to you too. I am neither friend nor foe. I am a messenger of Homeostasis. Homeostasis, in other words the one who desires stability. Since Gennai cannot currently act, I have come as the messenger. Gennai is the one who aids in keeping the balance between light and darkness. However, his hands have fallen into the darkness already, and now, the hands of darkness are spreading across the world. And Hime-Chan? She is currently in the Digital World of her own will. Ygdrasil will use any means to attain its purpose. Ygdrasil had its eyes on Maki Himekawa, and she joined hands with it. To obtain her own purpose. "PROJECT R reboot" We need the cooperation of humans to stop their rampage. They are trying to use the "Libra." Meicoomon... right? The "Libra" is unknown... If it falls into their hands, the world shall be led down a path of destruction. Koshiro-San! Everyone! Palmon! I'm tired of calling now. Patamon! Koshiro-San! Agumon! Koshiro-San! Why do I keep calling Koshiro-San so much? You guys get along! You two got along great before! Huh... I don't quite understand, but... Koshiro-kun, huh? He'd be a great help if he were here. Really, is that so? Mei... Do you not need me anymore? There we go. If you rest a little, it'll heal right away. Thank you, Elecmon. You're helping me babysit the little ones too. So we're even. This brings me back. We used to care for these guys with Patamon before. Sorry, no matter how many times you tell me, I can't recall it. In the Digital World, none of it supposedly happened. But... ...we still remember it. Of how we first met and when we had to say goodbye too... He's really important to you, huh? I wanna meet him too. Yeah. I wanna see him too. Will this lead us to Taichi and them? Who knows... If we follow these tracks, it may lead us to the lake with the trolley. Though I'm not absolutely sure. After hearing this whole story earlier, I wanna talk to Joe more. Like what's fun about studying or what a "girlfriend" is. There's a lot I wanna ask him. Yamato doesn't talk about Taichi at all. You guys don't get along? Well... Actually, they get along well. No, we don't. You don't like him? I don't hate him. It's just... I expect too much of him. Move, stupid! What was that?! Let's follow it! So fast! It's already gone! Looks like it isn't the tracks to the trolley. Let's find us a new route. Yep. So what were we talking about? About Taichi and Yamato. Let's leave that already. Taichi, huh... Next time I see him, he's got to get me some Takoyaki. Aren't we gonna look for everyone? What are we to you guys now? I couldn't do anything. I thought I could evolve Agumon if anything happened, but... ...it was no use. Taichi... Guess things can't go back to the way they were. I don't think everything about rebooting is all that bad. I think Salamon is better off now. Probably happier this way. Let's accept the Digimons as they are now. Or else, we can't move forward either. What should I do? I want to get along like before, but nothing's working. I know Biyomon doesn't remember the past, but... ...I wanted to be recognized. I was sure we'd be fine. But she says she doesn't know. She says, "I don't know who you are!" Did I go wrong somewhere? You aren't wrong! Partner Digimons are exceptional. We're always connected no matter what happens! You're the one who told me that! Don't say things like that! I'm sorry. No... I don't know either... ...what I can do for Mei-Chan. But still I'm her partner. I won't run anymore. Meiko-Chan... Mei-Chan?! Meicoomon? Mei... Mei-Chan, I'm so glad... Mei-Chan?! Why...? Why? Why didn't you come?! Meiko-Chan, watch out! Because you hate me? Because I'm bad? That's right. Because you're bad. That's why I ran! Mei...! I thought you were out of my hands already. Meiko...! But I finally came to see you, Mei-Chan! Because I like you! I didn't like you because you were good. You'll always be the same Mei-Chan to me! I was hiding it from everyone too. And I left you by yourself. I'm the bad one. Mei... I'm sorry. Let's go home, Mei-Chan. Meiko-Chan! Ichijouji-kun... Mei! Don't worry. I won't ever let go. Mei, bye-bye... Mei-Chan! Stay here! Sora-San! Sora... Hold on... I'm... coming...! Release Meicoomon! Ichijouji-kun, stop... This form is just an avatar. So I could come to your world. Gennai-San?! Although, I may not be the same Gennai you know. Surprised? Huh? It's just like Himekawa said. Himekawa-San? Why Himekawa-San...? Found it! Give it back! Without this you're just a kid. Stop... Biyomon?! Jeez, I can't bear to watch... Biyomon! Some stray Digimon. Biyomon is my partner! Aw man. Oh well, I'll play with you again soon. Run! Sora-San! Sora... Taichi... Yamato... Don't push yourself. You okay, Sora? Not exactly... Gabumon! Nice! Thanks! Taichi! Agumon! Where were you... ow, ow, ow! We were all able to meet! Thanks to the distortions connecting. Oh, it's Meimei! Why? How?! Taichi! Who are you? Why are you after Meicoomon?! It's the will of Ygdrasil. Now let's... play! Isn't he Gennai-San?! Gennai-San wouldn't do something like this! Is it that important if I'm Gennai or not? I'm a Digimon supporter! What?! Humans and Digimons shouldn't get involved with each other. But Homeostasis chose you guys, the Digimons became enslaved, and the two worlds grew too close together! We aren't enslaving them! What's "enslave?" To drag you around like that! Don't you remember the reboot? Or did you forget? Homeostasis itself chose you guys... ...and all of you went ahead and rebooted! You mean that reboot was...! All under the will of Ygdrasil. Puppy Howling! Can't we get this moving? Hmm... The electricity and hydraulics are completely out. If we could restart the engine... We'd need to get to the engine room for that. A huge thing like this can move? Salamon, why did you jump out? Well, because you're nice, Hikari. I wanted to save you. Mei... Mei-Chan! Thank goodness! You can't be with me or else you're gonna get beat up. I'm already beat up. We'll be fine. Mei... Everyone! I'm so sorry. This is because of us! What are you apologizing for? We all know that the Yg-somethin' is the bad one. Ygdrasil... Are they gonna sink the whole ship?! What're we gonna do? Are they gonna destroy us?! I won't let that happen! Takeru... He's right! They're the ones who're gonna be destroyed! Yeah, that's right! But we don't stand a chance! We're virtually on a sinking ship. But we must try. Will you help me, Tentomon? Koshiro-San... That's right. We have questions for him too. Like where is the food? Jeez, you... This won't last much longer! Sora-San and Mochizuki-San, evacuate to a safer place! But... We'll be the bait! Let's go, Agumon! Wait, Taichi! Taichi! A decoy, huh? How childish... Go out and play. Taichi! Koshiro-San, what're you gonna do? We're going to defeat him! 'Kay! 'Kay! Duck! All of a sudden?! You're gonna die if you don't run! Biyomon. I told you to run. You saved me too though. Because you're helpless. You're just a human, why would you go up to a scary enemy like that? But... I know. You're called a big softie. That's good. Huh? Sora, you're very kind. You finally called me "Sora." Well you are Sora, right? Hey, Sora. I want more of your meatballs. Okay! Everyone... Sora-San! Jeez! Sora, c'mon! Humans are so pitiful for having to live in fear of death. So incomplete! But Digimons are forever. Even if they break, they'll be revived as a Digi-Egg. Though, there are a few exceptions sometimes. If Digimons die in the human world, they can't be revived. Aww, how sad! That's where a reboot comes in. All those guys who died over there come back! Now's the time everyone joins hands to conquer the human world! Right, Meicoomon? Meicoomon? Yep. She's the key to destroying the world. Takeru! Boom Bubble! Patamon! Are you okay, Takeru? Move it! Joe! Marching Fishes! Yeow... ow, ow, ow! Poison Ivy! Palmon! Nice! Gomamon! You saved me! Joe, you're so helpless. Everyone! Now then. Huh? Now! Over here! Can you do it, Gabumon?! Yeah! Blue Blaster! Alright! Amazing... Against a big guy like that. You're the one who did it, Gabumon! Yamato! Oh... kun. Kun? Gabumon was wondering if he should call you by just your name or not. Taichi! Where's my "kun"?! Taichi! Taichi! Taichi! Yamato! Tapirmon! I... I've missed you so much... Who are you? A human? It's me, your partner... Liar. I don't know you. Why? We're partners, right? Tell me you've been waiting for me! Remember me! Taichi! Taichi! Agumon...? Why did you save us? Well, because you were about to get hit. Wasn't that the same for you guys though? I... ...didn't want to lose you again. I came to this world to see you... No one but you! Yeah. You're the only one. Gabumon! Agumon! Taichi, I wanna get stronger! Yamato, me too! Gabumon! Agumon! Taichi! Sorry for the wait! Taichi! Here it comes! Hikari! Salamon evolution! Gatomon! Lightning Paw! You okay, Hikari? Gatomon! WarGreymon... MetalGarurumon... Everyone! Tentomon shrunk! That was just a hologram earlier. Koshiro-San, you're amazing, you can do anything! That's our Koshiro-kun! It's nothing... What about him? Takeru! I did my best! Yeah. I knew you were the only partner for me, Gomamon! Hey, what's a partner? You said it. That I was your partner. That's... Biyomon! Sora-San! Let go of Biyomon! Sora-San! Sora, run! No! Sora! Sora! Why?! You want some of my meatballs again, right? I definitely want you to have some! Sora! I'm never letting go! Sora! Biyomon evolution! Birdramon! Birdramon super evolution! Garudamon! Garudamon ultimate evolution! Phoenixmon! That's...?! Biyomon...? That's... Havin' fun? Sorry to keep you waiting. Mei! Did you really think I didn't know? You guys are really just kids, huh? She evolved? Phoenixmon... The ultimate form! Sora-San! Takeru! I wanna fight too! Patamon... I can fight too! What about you? Takeru-kun! Okay! Patamon evolution! Angemon! Angemon super evolution! MagnaAngemon! MagnaAngemon ultimate evolution! Seraphimon! An ultimate evolution?! Koshiro-San! I want to help you more! Tentomon... Yes, let's follow them! Roger! Tentomon evolution! Kabuterimon! Kabuterimon super evolution! MegaKabuterimon! MegaKabuterimon ultimate evolution! HerculesKabuterimon! Star-Light Explosion! Mega Electro Shocker! I'm so pooped... Motimon! Koshiro-San, I'm sorry, am I heavy? Koshiro-San? So we still had a bond... Tokomon! Takeru! Yokomon, thank you. You were awesome. Sora. Sora, you were awesome too! So you two have finally overcome it too. You look smug, Joe. Palmon, you could have joined too! Really? Meiko! If you want to upset Meicoomon, the fastest way is hurting the partner. Now, release yourself, and destroy the world! Or your partner's gonna die 'cause of you. See? See? C'mon... You shouldn't have been born... You should have never been born... Is everyone okay? Yes, somehow. We defeated the Machinedramon! Huh? Sora... You two aren't hurt, are you? Y-Yeah... Then let's go back to Meimei's place! What? Uh, well... Sorry about earlier. Ohh. That's all right now. All right? It can't be all right. It's okay! Huhh? Stupid! What is it?! Don't look back, keep running. Sunshine day. Can't give in to the scratches and pain. Adventure. Stand up, there's nothing to fear. My future. It quenches my thirst. Your smile. Hiding deep within my heart. The weak side of me. Tell it goodbye and again. You can become stronger. Now's the time to take courage to fly. Spread the wings in your heart. To the unseen future. Now's the time to head towards the endless skies. It's just begun. The adventure to our dreams. La la la... La la la...
