Request permission to enter US airspace. I've had to leave a house in the middle of the night because of a man before, but this is the first time I've had to leave a country. 7221, you are cleared to enter. Okay, folks, we are now entering United States airspace. You're safe now. I've made this trip before. There were always dozens of white roses waiting for me in every suite but the men waiting at the door did not wear uniforms. They wore Armani. So, Virginia over the next few days you'll meet with officials from the Justice Department and they will inform you of the procedure to follow from now on. Can someone get me an aspirin please? My head is going to explode. Ma'am, for your own safety, you do not leave this room or communicate with anyone. I have two of my men standing outside. Do you understand? Can you get them to bring me an aspirin please? Virginia, American hotels don't give out aspirin anymore. It's considered a drug in this country. Pablo would have laughed at that too. Then he would have had them all killed. We have to finish him, Patrón. Do it, Pelao. Did you see the guest list? It's full of beautiful women. Colombia is full of beautiful women, my love. It's a party. Actresses, beauty queens. And soccer players, union delegates. You are much more beautiful. Look. Than the union delegates? Look who's coming. I don't like it, Pablo. Business and family separate. We already talked about it. I know, I know. With the party, everything is a little bit of a mess. I'll take care of it. I have the triggerman you asked for. I'll talk to him, and you take him away. I don't want him around. Don Pablo. Don Pablo. If you can find this coin, you can keep it. Go for it. I have a little job for you in Leticia. There's a file from seven years ago linking me to the murder of two DAS agents. You have to make it disappear, okay? Everything you find. Leave it nice and clean. Listen, you have contacts there, right? My cousin's wife works at the courthouse. She can get me in. There's no problem. Dad? I don't care if you have to take out somebody, or what you have to do. You can burn the building down if you want... but get rid of that file. You have 30,000 for expenses, for travelling, for ammunition, for rumba, for everything. If you run out, ask Salvador for more. He will... - Dad! - take care of everything. - Go on then. Go on. - You got it, boss. You find the coin? It's only five pesos. It's only five pesos? Don Pablo, you know how hard your daddy has to work to make some money? Give it back. Only five pesos. Is that the hacienda down there? We've been flying over it for a while, my love. We're getting kidnapped! It's okay, Virgie. Calm down. It's not okay. Do you know how much all of us here are worth? We'd all heard about or host, but none of us had ever met him. His name is at the top of the list of the nouveau riche. A group of young men that have made huge fortunes in very little time. Welcome. Please don't mind the weapons, they're there for the animals. We have a little zoo here. You like to see it? You scared us to death. Tell our host, this is no way to welcome guests. As soon as I see him. Oh, my God. They're beautiful. They're very happy here. They like Colombia. That's because they don't read the papers. This house is gigantic. I don't see the servants anywhere. There you have them. This new elite has its own social structure. Down in the corridors, the soldiers, young, uneducated men from the slums, warriors in the organization. They're nothing like the humble servants working on the ranches of the traditionally rich people in my country. They are confident. They handle security and operations, and... have good taste in women. Virginia, I never miss your show! You look so beautiful. Above them, the cream. Artists, businessmen, soccer players, journalists, models. Always a perfect distance away from our host. Cover your ears, Victor. There are so many handsome guys here. Thank you. Anyone who's anyone is here. Where does he make all this money? That's the question a reporter has to ask. Good one, good one, good one! Virginia. Virginia. Where have you been hiding? Pablo keep asking for you. He's driving us crazy, so come on. Victor, wait here. Don't fall in love with a local. And up the hill, the kings of the white mountain. We still don't know their names but soon, there won't be a single Colombian who doesn't. She was easy to find. I just went where all the men were looking. Pablo? Pablo Escobar? No. Your complaints were passed on to me, so I beg your pardon. You lied to me. Good Lord, of course I lied to you. I didn't want you to leave. You look even prettier in person. Then I'll have to fire my makeup girl. There's a lot of talk about you over there. Speculations about your past. No, no, no, don't listen to that. I only listen when they speculate about my future. I already know my past. And what's the occasion? It's just the founding of a society. What kind of society? Philanthropic. We are building houses for the poor. Nobody over there mentioned to you... No. Well, were going to build 2,000 homes for the people at the garbage dump. I got a very good price on a lot. And where does the money come from? What, is this an interview? I'm a journalist. Then come and see it. Come and see it. I'll show it to you. It's good for the country to know. Good for the country or good for you? Am I not a part of the country? We weren't aware at the time but that night we were celebrating the founding of the Medellin Cartel and the crowning of Pablo as its king. Things were about to change forever... in Colombia and in my life. Breathe through your mouth and you get used to it fast. Watch where you step. People dump bodies out here sometimes. You're kidding. Don Pablo! Don Pablo! Is everybody here named Pablo? Everybody. They named them after him. Listen, we are now finishing the first 600 but we want to build 2000, eh? 2000. Please tell our viewers the motivation and goal behind this wonderful initiative, Well, it is painful for us to see so many children starving completely unprotected by the government. And building these houses for them helps us to create a country that we always dreamed about. I love Colombia, and now that we have the chance to give back to this beautiful country that gave us so much that is exactly what we're doing. That day, I decide that I don't care how Pablo makes his money, only how he uses it. Do you know that people? I like the way you laugh. You laugh like on your show. You are so relaxed on TV. How do you do that? Do you think I could ever do that? There are tricks. Are you after my job? No, I'm not. Are you married? Not by choice. What does he do? He's a plastic surgeon. We are separated, but he doesn't want to sign the divorce. He doesn't want you to get married again? No, he doesn't want to have to marry one of his teenage girlfriends. Well, that can be fixed. You'll talk to him? Look, I don't like hanging around with married women. I don't. So, next time we are going out, you're not going be his wife. No? No. Will I be his widow? What do you take me for? Everyone ready? Virginia! Your lawyer called! Your ex signed the papers! - We are on in three, two... - What? To celebrate me being free again, Pablo takes me to an island paradise only he knows about. If you're going to cry over a man, better in a private jet than on a bus. Where are you going? They're waiting. Who? Do I look okay? You look perfect. How's it going, Patrón? Ma'am. Let's make a deal, you tell me your secrets and I'll tell you mine, okay? Our trip is an excuse to attend a congress of drug traffickers. Virginia, how are you? When did you arrive? Today. Pablo introduces me to his associates in the cartel. He shows me off to them like a trophy. And I know that they're also there to evaluate me. Between them, they form a new social class, the narco millionaires. And I'm the only journalist with exclusive access to their first summit. Thank you. I'm going to get a drink. Stay close, Virginia. These men can't be trusted, okay? The most illegal thing I'd ever done before that day was to double park. But the truth is never in my life had I felt safer. All of our priorities is labeled with a color that doesn't change. That night, they split the United States of America among them. Florida for the Medellin Cartel, New York for the Cali Cartel. The independents add their shipments to Pablo's. They know that nobody would ever dare to steal even one gram from him. Seeing him in his natural habitat, is addictive. Thanks to those men, it is going to snow cocaine in the US. Honey, did you see that? Hey, guys, are you nuts? What the fuck are you doing? Stuck in a jam on highway 75 heading southbound out of Temple. Holy shit. What are you doing? Are you fucking nuts! I almost killed you! They called them the saints, because they make the miracle of multiplication up there. Do the math. One kilo is worth $7,000 here in Colombia. In the United States, they cut it, add lactose and it becomes three kilos which are worth 150,000 there. Is that a miracle or not? - Oh, my God! - Jim, stop! Oh, shit! From the White House, President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan. A message on drugs. Despite our best efforts, illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels. It's especially damaging to the young people on whom our future depends. So tonight, from our family to yours, from our home to yours, thank you for joining us. America has accomplished so much in these last few years... Welcome, Agent Shepard. The President is glad to have you on board. - Thank you. - This is Mr. Velarde, representing the Colombian government. Nice to meet you. The President's worried about the latest report. Cocaine is no longer the drug of the jet set, it's reaching the middle class. You know what that means. It's coming in without control. 80 percent is coming from Colombia. We're working to have an old bilateral treaty reactivated. The Extradition Treaty. We'll catch the narcos and turn them over so you can try them here. They don't fear the judges in Colombia, they either bribe them or kill them. But they do fear your justice. Is there a legal basis for this? The coke is produced in my country, but it's consumed here. The crime is completed in the United States. I brought a draft. The President knows your record. He wants you to monitor the whole process. The President will be over shortly. We are hoping to implement this in the next day or so. Drugs take away the dream from every child's heart and replace it with a nightmare. And it's time we in America stand up and replace those dreams. What are we, children? Don't we have judges here? No mother sends her children to the neighbors to be punished. No. What do the lawyers have to say? Is this constitutional? Can it be appealed? Yeah, it can be appealed. We have to knock it down. That treaty puts us in danger to everyone here. Every one of you, every one of us. We have to fight it from the institutions, from inside. From Congress? It's the only way. Throw money at them, both sides. Conservatives and Liberals, they all like the good stuff. The spotlight like this, bad for business. And whatever they look for in your house, they'll find in everyone else's. Listen to us, please. They'll go after you. Politics is a bitch. No, hermano. It's the other way around. If you reach Congress, they respect you. Why? Because you're one of them. You know how much it costs to run for state council in Colombia? Ten million pesos. Ten million pesos. And for Senator I think it is between 100 and 120 million pesos. 1,500 million pesos more or less, for president of the republic. Tell me who can spend that kind of money? The son of a farmer? A worker? No, no. Politics comes down to money here. Democracy comes down to money here. So we have plenty of money. You, Garza, what's so funny? You should listen to yourself, Pablito. You're already talking like a politician! Sir, we have an appointment with the candidate. Are they armed? Why of course they are, they're my bodyguards. I'm sorry, sir. If they're armed, they can't come in. They're carrying our donation to your campaign. If they can't come in, the donation can't either. So go ask your candidate if that's what he wants. The cartel bets on both horses. Why put money on only one candidate when you can put money on both? That way, no matter who wins, they win. The narco's planes carry candidates during the day and fly to the United States at night. And what do they get in exchange? You defend the competency of the Supreme Court to question the constitutionality of the Extradition Treaty, it will be good for all of us, Mr. Candidate. These gentlemen want to donate 25 million pesos to our campaign here in Antioquia. People call the contributions made by the drug lords... hot money. Why? It's okay. You can leave it on the floor. We'll find someone to pick it up later. Because it burns. How far are you going to take this, Pablo? We're doing fine. Don't we have enough? Mi amor, in Congress I can get things done, I can help people, I... Help your family first. You have money, Pablo. You have us. What more do you want? I want respect. Respect? I want respect. I want my son to be proud of me. Is that so hard to understand? First, he'd have to see you, Pablo, but you're never home. Don Pablo, mi amigo, go to the living room. There's nothing on TV? Good Lord, who bought him that car? Victoria, mi amor, don't you want to be the First Lady? I'd settle for being the only lady, Pablo. Oh, my God. No, no, again. She's helping me with my political campaign. I want respect too, Pablo. Like you. I respect... The difference is yours is enough for me. I respect you. No, you don't. - I do. - You don't. I'll prove it. What do you want me to do? What? I'll do it. What? That bitch from TV. End it with her. I promise right now it is over now. Now. Right now. I promise. I promise. I promise. It is over. Give me one of those laughters. See, see? We want a country like a mother, generous and fertile, who shares her wealth equally with her children, but who always looks out for the weakest. We want a country like a mother who defends her children from foreign aggression without hesitation. Severe but understanding. Long live the mothers of Colombia and our motherland. They will cry tears of blood the day the first son is extradited. Let's stay in Antioquia to see how election day has gone. At this time, most of the votes have been counted. For Alternativa Popular, Movimiento de Renovación Liberal Pablo Escobar Gaviria has been elected representative of the house of Medellin for Colombia... Senator Escobar is denied entry the first day he attends Congress. Why? Because he smuggles forty tons of cocaine a year into the United States? No. I'm sorry, sir, but a tie is required to enter our chamber. That's my country for you. What are you doing looking through my bag? That's not where you'll find a picture of my lover. What's that? It's a surprise, surprise for you. Pablo, take that money out of my bag right now! Why? You're not going to put me in danger! I have nothing to do with your business, okay? It's a gift for you, Virginia. This is for you to enjoy it. A gift. This is a gift for me? But, Pablo, that's a lot of money! I know, but don't worry. The American government doesn't care how much you bring in. It only cares how much you take out. So you can declare it all when you get to customs. But it's too much! I cannot accept it. Look, it doesn't even fit. That's the problem, it doesn't fit. We have to take out the clothes. You can buy new ones there, see? Take them all out. Take them all out. But you have to spend all the money, you can't bring anything back with you, Virginia. All my life waiting to hear those words! Colombians don't turn on their TVs to see me, but what I'm wearing. Pablo is aware of this, and he takes care of all my needs. This is called coca paste and the poorest drug addicts mix it with gasoline and call it bazook. This crap will fry your brain. There's nothing worse than this. Now, when you cook it, you get this little white powder but it's the same shit. We work with this, eh? But we do not take it here. Have you heard of Nancy Reagan? No? She's a very important lady and she says that if anybody offers you this stuff, you just say no. You're going to listen to that lady. To her and to your daddy. You just say no, eh? Hello. 88, please. Thank you. Miss Vallejo? Do we know each other? Do you have any plans? Can I have a moment of your time? Do you lack selfconfidence, Agent Shepard? Give me two hours? Sure. I saw your interview with Mr. Escobar. Thousands of people saw it. What can you tell me about him? So disappointing. You're not interested in me, you're interested in Pablo. I'm a married man. So, you know how he makes his money? What does your embassy over there tell you? Nothing good. Well, Mr. Escobar is an elected government representative. So I don't think the DEA has any legal authority to interfere in Colombian politics. The drugs produced in your country are entering mine, and that worries us. No. No. Your government is only worried about the money leaving the country, not the drugs that come in. You don't have this problem with the Italian Mafia, because what they make stays here. Drug money is different. It flies away. That's what worries you. What did he say, Pablo, when you told him that you were coming to meet me? What did he say? He said to make sure the United States pays the bill. You two are involved. You have the nerve to ask me that? Why don't you ask your friends at the CIA? I will. You know what? I would have agreed to a drink... even without the badge. Where's Pablo? He had to go to Bogota. Congress is holding a special session. They want to revoke his appointment. They cannot do that. That bastard Minister of Justice has it out for us. He requested the review. Things are getting wild, Virginia. The whole country is watching us. We are in the spotlight. Congressmen. This is a disgrace. These men, who became inexplicably rich overnight have reached this sacred institution with their shady dealings. Their presence in the house is an insult to every Colombian. Congressman Escobar, it certainly must have been quite a struggle for you to obtain your fortune and to go from having a few properties in Medellin to accumulating more than two billion dollars in less than two years. Apparently, his honor the Minister of Justice doesn't believe that a person of humble origin can, through hard work, reach a higher social position or a seat in this room. Maybe you should question your own presence here, Mr. Minister. Because you don't believe in the justice that you represent. And you want the justice system of another country for our citizens, so you don't deserve your position. You should resign. You have lied today by suggesting that my money's linked to drug trafficking. That's why I'm giving your honor 24 hours to present solid evidence of your accusations against me. Actually, you are the one who should explain the origin of the money that financed your campaign. I will bring, I will bring proof to this room of the quantities that you and some of your colleagues have received from certain people. Yes. Unlike you, solid proof. When, where, and how much. Evidence. Apparently Congressman Escobar has detailed information about how drug trafficking operates. Which continues to surprise for a humble and hardworking man like himself. Pablo, resign! Leave! Leave before they kick you out! I want my son to see me there, Victoria. You don't want your son to see what the whole country saw today, Pablo. Today. Those men clapping in there today and laughing in there today, they have a lot to hide. The President publicly backed the Minister! The President backs the Minister because he has a lot to hide too! So, what are you going to do, accuse the President as well? In front of the whole country! Pablo, you're a drug trafficker. Yes, and those bastards, they stand up when I call them they come to my parties, and they grab every penny I gave them! You promise me everything will be all right. Everything is fine. I'm pregnant. I don't want our baby to suffer. He won't suffer. - Promise me it won't suffer. - It won't... Promise me or I won't have it. Who's this? I don't want a single newspaper on the street! I will pay 500 pesos per copy! Spread the word in the slums. El Espectador does a cover story about the sins of Pablo's youth backing the Minister's accusations. His criminal record includes his involvement in the murder of two police officers in Leticia. IN JAIL FOR DRUG CHARGES IN 1976 Goodbye career in politics. The triggerman Pablo sent to erase his past didn't do his job. He spent the money on women who will not mourn his death today. And since he's such an important minister, I have three different operations prepared for him. You want to know about them, I let you know and you let me know which one you like the most. If you prefer not know I'll do it anyway. He's a minister, Pablo. You can't kill a minister, hombre. No? Who says that? You? It's time to start killing people, so they learn to respect us. Look, this is how it goes. Every one of us put up ten million pesos for expenses so that way we are all committed. Either we are all innocent of we are all guilty. That easy. We're going to create a company to kill a minister? In Cali, we don't want to mix blood with business. It complicates things. Things are already complicated. Haven't you noticed up there in Cali? In war you can't win halfway, hermano. There are no half winners and half losers. We have to go all the way in. I mean, you people in Cali don't like blood, then you'd better not come to my house to insult me. Pablo, he didn't mean to insult you, man. Then I didn't mean to warn him. Lara won't be in the country for long. They'll send him somewhere as an ambassador. Then you can kill him. I was insulted by a minister, not an ambassador. Do you want to hear the plans? Are they decided or what? They think they are. Here. What are we celebrating? That everything is going to change. I want you to carry it with you all the time. All the time. Oh, Pablo. Open it. Open it. Open it. Is this a joke? It is not a joke. Things are going to get very complicated, Virginia. Very. I don't need a gun, Pablo. Not me. Virginia, I need you to understand what's going to happen that day they come for you. They will rip off your clothes, that dress you're wearing now. What is? Thierry Mugler. That one. They will put it around your ankles and they will hold you down on the ground while many, many soldiers take turns to rape you. They will bring them just for you from the jungle, hungry for a woman and they will get on you one after another until they tear your vagina to pieces and then they will break bottles and they will stick those broken bottles in it and they will stick blenders and hair dryers and and they will turn them on full blast inside of you, yes. And when you think you are going to faint, they will wake you up with cold water so that you are awake for the next group of soldiers. Then they will let you bleed till you die from inside. This is why this is the best gift I can ever give you, my love. Take it. If there are three coming at you, take out the first one, the one who's closest. If there are four or more, then... Yes, you better kill yourself. I want to go. I want to go. - Don't cry. - I want to go. Okay. Okay. I'll take you home. The narco gives the boys in the slums the education they don't get from the government. They don't mind dying if they can leave 20 thousand to their mothers because they know that's more than they will make in a lifetime. To be a good sicario, you have to be more than just prepared to kill. You have to be prepared to die. And now, let's go to Cartagena de Indias where they are celebrating one of the biggest events in Colombia. No. We've just received a news update saying... saying that Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla has been assassinated only minutes ago in Bogota. In an emergency release, the President Belisario Betancur has called the Minister's murder a crime against humanity... Mom. What's wrong? And declared the country in a state of siege. BREAKING NEWS We'll be back with more information as we compile more facts about what happened. Thank you. The government takes on the Mafia. President Betancur promises to activate the extradition treaty. The corporation relocates. Where? Where they keep the money. The cartel proposes a negotiation with the government which sends an ex-president to hear Pablo's proposal. At the present time control roughly 80 percent of global traffic. We offer the repatriation of our capital abroad to boost the national economy and also pay our country's external debt presently estimated at 12 billion dollars. In exchange, we request amnesty and the guarantee that under no circumstances, no circumstances, we will be extradited to another country for any illicit activities that may have occurred to date. You know things are very hot over there, after the Minister. Ah, yes, we were very sorry to hear about that, sir. Listen closely before we go on. Ex-president Michelsen and myself are not here. The president of the country has not authorized this meeting. This isn't happening, is that clear? A timely clarification. Much in the very same way that my clients are sitting at this table representing third parties, rather than their own. The extradition part is nonnegotiable. We can't guarantee anything without the agreement of our North American partners. Ah, the North American partners. They're gringos. Who needs them? This is a matter between Colombians. You have to revoke that extradition treaty. Revoke it. Go and tell your President, the one you are not representing here. Yes, what's the other option? War. And we all know what war is about. The one who has more cash wins it. And look at us. Who has more cash here? Pablo couldn't keep his word. His daughter is born outside Colombia. He holds the people who drove him from the country responsible. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper that published his past gets killed. Hello? You're not carrying the present I gave you. Virginia, where is it? I should have guessed when I saw your boys downstairs. No, no, my boys are not downstairs. You have so many agencies following you that it is impossible to park on your street. I'm used to men following me. You are seeing someone else. Don't forget that I listen to your conversations. You do? Then you've heard the threats? Since you started killing ministers, people keep calling me. They turn on chainsaws, they play funeral marches for me. What happened to the Minister was entirely his fault. And what is going to happen to this country now is the government's fault, it's not my fault. And now the gringos want to extradite me after Lara, so we have to stop that treaty no matter what. And those of us who are in the position to be extradited, we are going to send a message to the government and to the judges. And to the journalists. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pablo, you are losing your mind. Why? You don't listen to anyone. You think you can take on everyone just by yourself. You're headed straight for suicide. You're coming with me. You'll be my biographer, remember? The one who will tell the story. To whom? There won't be anyone left to hear it. No, wait, wait, wait. Take that away. You've got the wrong house. Judge Carlos Alberto Alarcón? That's me. This is for you. It's from Don Pablo Escobar Gaviria. Pablo turns threatening people into its own genre. Oh, no, no, no. Only one thousand million pesos! Only! They're insulting us. No, no, no, no. This is what we'll do. Hand out guns in the slums, the more the better. Two thousand guns, three thousand guns, I don't care. For every dead cop, I will pay 2,000 dollars! And for every sergeant, I will pay $5,000. For every lieutenant, I will pay $10,000. For every captain, $20,000. For every army major, $50,000. To get paid, it's very easy. They have to bring the badge of the men they kill. The law quickly sets its exchange rate in the slums. Ten executions for each dead police officer. They see every teenage boy as a future sicario. I'm not asking you. I'm ordering you. I'm giving you 24 hours to do what I say or I will kill your mother, I will kill your father, I will kill your grandmother. Soon, all of those dead, whether killed by Pablo or his enemies will haunt me as well. The Colombian government creates a special unit exclusively for my boyfriend. We're 500 men here, all from Bogota devoted only to capturing Pablo Escobar. We can't take anyone from here. We even bring in our own food, so they won't poison us. What makes the DEA think we need you here? Extradition Treaty isn't working, is it? So, if you don't send them up to us, we come down and get them. Nice. Using three receivers on land we can precisely calculate the signal in a 200-yard radius. If one of the posts detects relevant information it activates the protocol. Hit the switch, you'll hear a sound cue which will inform your officer the recording is in progress. Sir! Escobar! He's in Sector 2, La Victoria. It's a mobile line, sir. The DEA set up sophisticated tracking systems to pinpoint Pablo. Escobar! He's having lunch at El Dorado. It's a public phone, sir. Sector 7, La Estrella. That's on the other side of the city. Escobar! Is he everywhere? They didn't take into account the paisa astuteness. I saw Pablo at the corner. On Bolivar Avenue. Nothing lasts forever, Virginia. You know we have new partners, and they have requested changes. And your replacement, she has the right people behind her. Who she fucks is not the problem, it's who I fuck. Don't turn this around, Virginia. We don't care what you do in your personal life here. They told you to fire me. Nobody told me to do anything. It's an artistic decision. Replacing me with that cheap whore is an artistic decision! Since when? Say it. Just say it. This is because of him. Say it. Say it! We don't care what that gentleman lover of yours does for a living. No? You might care from now on, you motherfucker. And you better watch out, 'cause I'm gonna tell Pablo to blow up your fucking building with you and your family inside. And that's gonna be an artistic decision too! What's wrong with men? Nobody ever told you that if you want to see a woman, you're supposed to call first? Don't show me your badge. I accept. It's good news then. Great news. TV networks are like men. Sometimes you have to leave them to be appreciated. So, what's your plan? I have an offer from a network in Florida. I might take it. Start a new life. But I would need a man. Are you still married, Agent Shepard? Until you've made love to a Colombian woman, that changes everything. Please don't put my life in danger, Virginia. Pablo doesn't need an excuse to kill a DEA agent. He'll take you with him when he goes down. You know that, don't you? Virginia, you were fired by the network and you don't have any offers. No one will hire you. Not here, not in Miami, nowhere. You're marked, right, for life. So you're gonna have to find something else to do. Anything. And you're not 20 anymore. Your legs aren't as pretty as they used to be, or your smile. What do you propose? Help us. In exchange for what? Protection. Protection! There is no such thing. Pablo will find me no matter where I go. Do you think he doesn't scare me? You think all the threats and death and smell of burnt flesh don't affect me? Help us find him. You know what? The TV networks only want little girls now. They don't value the experience of a woman. Is that what Pablo values in you? Exactly. And my loyalty. The bill has been paid. Wait here. What all the gringos want, Pablo, to catch you. - Is he staying in Medellin? - Are you following me? No, no, I'm not following you. And what if I'm following you? Do you have something to hide, Virginia? Pablo, don't follow me, and don't call me anymore! Okay? You are ruining my life. You are ruining my life. You know that I got fired because of you! People keep avoiding me like the plague! Nobody will come near me! Well, that gringo have no problem coming near you. Stop talking about him and listen! Stay away from me! I beg you! Stay away! You're saying that because you know they are recording this and you want them to think it is over between us. It is over between us! Hear it, it is over! If anyone's out there listening, please record this! I have nothing to do with the psychopathic killer on the other side of the line! Listen, I call you back. I call you back. Do you like birds? Yes, they represent freedom. Pablo's lovers, teenage girls from poor neighborhoods handed over by their families for a few thousand pesos. It isn't easy sleeping with the most wanted man in Colombia and keeping it a secret. Believe me, I know. It just takes one of them to talk to have the Search Bloc find him. Oh, God. Listen, I need to reach Pablo. Our people in Miami are getting out of line. The routes are falling apart, and the Cali Cartel is getting our territory! We can't finance this war if the business stops working, you understand? I don't want you to kill them. They're our link up there. I just want you to find Pablo. Is that so difficult to understand to you? Monje's death meant the fall of the cartel's financial wing. Garza's death meant the fall of the toughest wing. Pablo loses his strong men. From this point on, he can only run. For years we have called for peace, but the only response we've gotten has been official and systematic persecution against our families and organizations. That's why I declare full out war on the government and the political establishment. If they make me run, I make them run too. Terrorism is the atomic bomb of the poor. We're not using lead anymore. From now on, we're using dynamite, understand? And how do we know that you are really Pablo Escobar Gaviria and not someone else pretending to be him? That is very easy. I will prove it to you by killing you and your family tonight, and blowing up your radio station. What do you think? Would that be enough? Hey! You're a celebrity in your country, Virginia. What's so appealing about coming to Miami to host a TV show? Well, I don't really think I have anything else to prove in Colombia. No? But I guess what appeals to me is the challenge, the excitement of a new adventure. Also, there are some very attractive men in this part of the world. Tell us, Virginia, what's the last show you hosted on Colombian TV? How you doing? FBI. Mind if we take a look at your passport? You carry any money? My ex isn't using me as a mule, yet. Okay. Oh, my God! What happened? I'm sorry, they just closed Bogota Airport. Why? I'll call you back. An Avianca plane exploded in midflight. After the first bombs, the country asked the government to give Pablo hell. After a dozen bombs, the country begs the government to give Pablo what he wants. Pablo! Newell. There was a Newell in my graduating class. You think it could be him? What is it? List of victims on the Avianca flight. 107 people on board. They just sent it. Robin Newell and Catherine Gilmore. 35, 32 years old. Married. Sir? Sir, wait. Ambassador, there were two Americans on the Avianca flight. So, listen, directive 12.333 authorizes military operations in foreign countries to guarantee the security - of American citizens... - Thank you, Sarah. Agent Shepard, I'm sure you know Mr. Velarde. He's also the man in charge of negotiating the surrender of Pablo Escobar. This is Mr. Castro. He's Mr. Escobar's legal representative. He's agreed to turn himself in to the authorities. In exchange for what? By revoking the Extradition Treaty, our judges and magistrates have taught the world a lesson in sovereignty, independence and patriotism. After years of persecution... Pablo adds one last condition to his surrender. He provides the prison. It is very pretty, isn't it? He cedes the property to the municipality through a front man so they can build it there. Everyone's here but the President. He couldn't make it. Scheduling problems. Without the threat of extradition hanging over him Pablo needs a safe place to reorganize his business. And the government provides him with one. The Conception and Norman Key routes are working again. The Fany is at almost one hundred percent. We have 250 planes in service and 30 Pipers still immobilized in Santamarca. Are you talking to the number two at the Aviation Authority? Talk to him, he's a brother. If he doesn't want to play ball you bring him here and I talk to him. So, for everyone who is still outside, nobody moves a gram without me knowing it. Nobody. Understood? They have to pay the taxes that they owe me. That's 20 percent. - 20 percent? - 20 percent. They won't like that, Pablo. The Cali people are asking for five percent. Jesus, everyone will go to them and that's OK. How do you know that? Have you talked to them? You prefer those pussies from Cali, go to them and try your luck. I came up with the routes, I took out extradition all by myself so you can keep working. So make everybody knows that the one who hasn't paid with cash, merchandise or properties will pay with his life. What's next? Soccer players from the professional league come to play with the traffickers. And the match isn't over until the Patrón wins. The social workers have arrived! Sundays are saved for family. Why don't you live at home with us, Daddy? Because I work here, Princess. My princess. This is my castle. I... Do you see those towers there? Those are my towers. I am a king, and king has castles. And that's why you are a princess, because you are my daughter. But there are guards. Yes, of course there are. They are here to protect me. Mommy says you can't leave, and she cries all the time. What do you mean I can't leave? Who says that? Mommy. This is my castle. I can come and go as I please. You wanna see that? You want to go out for an ice cream? Where is the place that the big park near the church. That's the one you like. Let's go. Let's go. What did you have for lunch? Good Lord. Don't wait for us. Manuela and I are going out for an ice cream. Pablito still has his sense of humor. Who's in charge of this castle? Who's the boss here? You, Patrón. Yeah, that's what I like to hear. Open the door. Open the door! Open it. The king and his princess are going out for an ice cream. - What flavor you want? - Strawberry! Strawberry! The princess has a craving! If you dare to stop us, the king will cut your heads off. Open the door. Open the door. Our carriage is waiting for us. Give me the keys. Give me the keys, man. The king is asking for the keys of the car. Give me the keys. Give me the keys, man! Pablo! Pablo! I forgot to tell you, my princess, that... I made them bring the best ice cream, strawberry ice cream of the world here for you. Strawberry ice cream just made with ice from the North Pole which is especially for my daughter, my princess, especially! The best one in the world! For you. Really? Have you heard of the strawberry icebergs in the North Pole? They're very famous. Not only has the media banned me. My advertising contracts are also cancelled which forces me to sell my home to pay my debts. Be careful with that! What you just moved with your foot is a very expensive piece of Indonesian art. I'm not asking you to use your head. Using your hands will be enough. I rent an apartment at El Nogal where a former First Lady lives, hoping her bodyguards will keep an eye on me as well. How are you boys? Fine, thanks. And I get a break from the telephone threats. All set, ma'am. Wasn't it a new number? But not for long. Nice hotel! How's our book going? What book? Who would want to read a book about you? I have my admirers. Your admirers can't read, they're too young. That's true. That's one of their virtues. You know that I left a meeting to see you, so, what do you want? Tell me. I need to know if I'm safe. And how would I know that? No one is safe in this country. As far as you're concerned, can I feel safe? No! Nobody will kill their own biographer, don't worry. Relax. What else? Oh, Pablo. You can't imagine how terrifying my life has become. My phone won't stop ringing. Threats, every day, threats. You have an army of men to protect you, but who protects me? What about me? What can I do? I need you to tell everyone we are not together anymore. You're breaking my heart. After all that I've done for you. What have you done for me? Nothing! I already had a career when I met you. Don't forget that. And I'm the only woman who has loved you without expecting anything in return and that includes your wife. No, no, no, no, no. Don't you ever dare to compare to my wife. Don't even put the name of Victoria on your lips. She was with me when I didn't have a peso. Would you have noticed me back then? With no planes and no trips and no shopping in New York? Would you have? No, tell me, would you? I don't think so. I'm broke, Pablo! I'm broke! My career is over because of you! Nobody will hire me anymore because of you! So you need to help me! How? What do you need? Tell me. What do you need, Virginia? 80 thousand dollars to go to Europe. 80 thousand dollars. That's a lot of money. 80 thousand dollars. I don't have that money. No, I don't. And you are my biographer, you have to stay here. I've seen things, Pablo. I've seen things. While I was with you. You've seen what? Things that implicate a lot of people! If I wanted to talk! If you what? No, no, no, no! No, I never expected this from you. Really. My God, that's not what I mean! Pablo, I would never betray you! It's just that I'm desperate! I don't even know what I'm saying anymore! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry, I will take care of you. I will protect you. I'll make sure you have a long life. You want to know what? I have bad news for you. Nobody will get near you because they will be afraid that I will kill them. So your life is going to be full of shit. Peladito. The things are getting rough out there, man. Business, business isn't good, man. No, they're not good, no. One question, the Fany route moves, what, 10 kilos a month? Yeah. And you pay me, what 50 thousand? 50 thousand? The Fany route failed twice this month. We lost two 600-kilo shipments. We have to pay the owners, hire lawyers for the pilots. Yeah, yeah, but the deal was 250, no? I gave you that route, remember? 250 is impossible, Pablo. Is impossible, I mean it. Trust us. We are your partners, you son of a bitch. We've been together from the start. Well, we're not in this together. I'm here and you're out. Yeah, we know that, Pablo. But you have to pay me the tax. So... You have to. Either you pay it, or I double it right now. We have to discuss it with the other families. Business has changed a lot. Things aren't the same they used to be anymore. 50 thousand should be enough. 50 thousand should be enough. So you come here to sit down in front of me with that gold and those fancy clothes. You're all getting rich out there, while I am here. No, no, no, Pablo. And then you're flirting with the Cali people. And to top it off, you don't want even to pay me. No, no, don't complain. Don't complain. You are already dead. This is just a formality. This way your families can put the pieces back together. The murders at La Catedral reached the media and make the government an accomplice. Its credibility is at stake. They decide to transfer Pablo to a military prison. The fence of the prison was electric but the switch was in Pablo's room. Our people are turning on us, Patrón. Apparently, they're thinking, if he did that to Santoro and Hermosilla, what will he do to us? Running like chickens straight to Cali. What, do you think that was a mistake? Sure it was. Pablo's ex-associates cooperate with the government in exchange for having their records cleared. Dozens of narcos willing to fight him are released. To the airport. Son, say goodbye. This is not a country, it's a mass grave. Hey, hey, hey! Who are you? What the fuck do you want? Pablo's enemies, members of rival cartels, and paramilitary groups together with government security forces supported by the DEA and the CIA formed the most lethal hunting party of all time. The bodies of Pablo's lawyers, hitmen, accountants, and family appear scattered all over Medellin. Anyone who's ever been close to him becomes a target. Good morning. Can I help you? Good morning. These belonged to European royalty. And these earrings. If you give me a good price, I bring you more. Okay. Let me have a look. Exquisite. Don't open the door. - Do you know him? - No. Call the police. Call the police. Call the police! I'm sorry. No! What are you doing? I don't want to get in trouble. Sorry. Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! No, no, no! I'm going to be a star. Look. Victoria, do you hear that? Manuela's gonna be a star in a Christmas show. Will you come and see me? Yes, I will. Mom made me a shiny costume. I am sure you're beautiful in it. Don't cry. Don't cry. She won't be in the show. What? Why? The parents of the other children objected. They held an assembly. She doesn't know yet. Why? Why? Because they're afraid your enemies will blow up the school, Pablo, that's why. They are scared. Give me your hand. I need you to take the kids, get in a plane and get out of this country. It's getting very dangerous for you here. You can't stay here. You can't. So, once you leave I can take care of things. You didn't keep your promise, Pablo. You promised me everything would be fine. I know. That my children would have a normal life. Does this seem like a normal life to you? There's a woman out here, she wants to talk to you. What's her name? I don't know. She got mad at me when I asked. Says she's famous around here. He needs to get his family out of the country. They cannot stay here. They would reach them in America, so they have to go to Europe. And as soon as they are out, he'll feel free to destroy everything. So you cannot let them leave. As long as they are here, he'll be busy trying to protect them. You better trust me. You can't let them leave. This is his weak spot, his family, his family, his family. It's all he cares about, nothing else. And you know that firsthand, don't you? No, you have no idea. We can't do that. The Attorney General is the one getting them out of the country. They made a deal. Once they're out, Pablo Escobar will turn himself in. Break your word. Let's put some pressure on the German Chancellor. They land in Cologne in two hours. Do not let them get off that plane. There's no legal reason they can't travel to Germany. Bring them back. The family is bait. We need them alive and at home. Put them someplace, and we sit and we wait. Pablo will try to talk to them, right? When that happens, we'll be ready. Pablo Escobar Gaviria's family was greeted by a strong security presence upon arrival in Bogota this morning after being denied entry into Germany. The wife and the two children of the couple were forced to spend the night in Cologne's airport, and later sent back to Colombia on a regular... They have taken my family hostage! That the family requested upon arrival... The Army has cordoned off the apartment building where they are staying. The operation has been joined by men from the Fiscalía and the Search Bloc. Juan Pablo, please turn it off. Do you need anything else? No, thank you. Pablo! Thank you very much. You're welcome. I should've asked if anyone wanted anything. Hello? Call! Victoria, what happened? Are you okay? Is everyone okay? They treated us well, my love. Don't worry. You have to be careful, okay? How are they? How are you? How is Manuela? How's Manuela? She's okay, my love. She's okay. You're all we think about, Pablo. We miss you so much. When you come and go, are they protecting you? Are they holding you hostage? There's an army outside. Puppy Dog, do you read? The man is on the phone. La América sector. I repeat La América sector. We're on our way, sir. Ask the Attorney General to release you. Yes, Attorney General. Yes, only I take care of my family, nobody else. Nobody else, okay? Hello. Hello. Anybody listening? Hello. Hello. Two minutes, Patrón. I know that you are all there listening. Hiding like a bunch of fucking pussies. The Colonel and his Bloc trash, and all of you... And the CIA, and that motherfucker from the DEA. I already spared your life once. I won't spare it again. You hear me? Now listen to me, motherfuckers, everyone. I'm going to kill you and your children and your wives and I'm saving a special bullet to put right in front of your fucking skull and you're going to bleed until you die! Don't call here anymore, mister. This place is full of cops... Victoria, don't tell me what to do. No, no, no, don't tell me what to do. Nobody ask you. Yes, yes, keep Manuela nearby. Stay calm, Patrón. Go check. Go check. Hold on. The previous moment to something happening is always the best moment. Like when you are waiting for the man you love or when you are about to open a present. The fishermen from the coast of Colombia say that what really matters is the wait. Feeling the sea breeze on your face, the salt on your lips. Imagining that little fish fucker approaching the bait. He wants to bite it, but he thinks it over. But if the bait is good enough, the fish will eventually bite it. Even when he knows there is a hook inside... he'll bite. Call! Daddy? Manuela. How is the most beautiful star in the sky? Mommy says I can't be in the show. Mommy's wrong. Mommy's saying that because she wants it to be a surprise. Don't tell her that I told you that. I'm getting a signal. Somewhere in Los Olivos, between 80 and 90th. Los Olivos, 80 and 90th. And you have your dress ready? It's all shiny, Daddy. Beautiful. Beautiful. Everything's going to be much, much better from now on, you will see. My love you will see. Correction. 70 and 80. Will you come and see me? Yes, I will. Of course. Will they let you? They? They will. Of course they will. And you know why? Because you're the king? Yes, I am the king. 72 and 80th. 74 and 80th. - 74 and 80th. - He's to my left! 50 meters! Turn here! Sweetheart, put Juan Pablo on. I just saw him! We got him! Inform the President! Dad? Patrón, two minutes. Mijo, you are now the man of the house. Now you have to take care of your mother and Manuela. Okay. Okay, I have some notes for you to tell the press. Go ahead. Write it down, write it down. Okay, the Attorney General agreed on getting you out of the country, but they didn't do it because they gave into the pressure of my enemies in Colombia and out of Colombia. Tell them that Pablo Escobar agreed on turning himself in the moment his family was safe but they didn't keep their side of the deal, and now they will have to pay the consequences. Move in! Whatever happens from now on is gonna be their fault. Okay? Repeat what I said back to me, Juan Pablo. No, no, no, no, no. No, that's not what I said, Juan Pablo. That's not what I said. I said that they are responsible for all of this, and that they have to face the consequences now. Okay, Dad. I'm going to hang up. You tell that son of a bitch... Say it! Listen, you have to learn this! If you can't get people to like you then you have to make them respect you! And if they don't respect you, then make them fear you! Understand? Understand? Make them fear you! Do you hear that? Hold on. Dad? Long live Colombia! Long live Colombia! Long live Colombia! - Long live Colombia! - Long live Colombia! - Long live Colombia! - Long live Colombia! - Long live Colombia! - Long live Colombia! Long live Colombia! A last minute wire confirms that Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the ex-boss of the Medellin cartel has been gunned down today by members of the Search Bloc in a residential neighborhood of Medellin. Along with Escobar, police also killed Carlos Mejía Rosales alias Pelao. Virginia. You ready? I'll wait for you outside. Do you still love him? I love Pablo. I hate Escobar. Would you be willing to testify before a Federal judge? He asked me to tell his story. He just didn't say who to tell.
