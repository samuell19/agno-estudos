Got something on your mind? Got fired my job. Come home and find my fiance with another woman. Where are you gonna go? - Anywhere but here. I'm not even mad about it though. I didn't like my job but I didn't hate it enough to quit, and that relationship, I mean, that was over a long time ago. - Wondering what it's all about. - I spent my entire life living at the same place. Having the same people around me, the same faces every day. - Time for a road trip. - Yeah. See the world and all. - Where are you headed? - I don't know, wherever the road takes me, I guess. - Well be careful. It might take you places you don't wanna go. - How long you looking to stay? - Um, just the night. I'm not a big fan of driving after dark. - Well there's a motel down the road but, just do not take room number one. - Why? - Just, don't. Trust me. - Evenin'! - I'd like a room? - Sure, why else would you be here? Here, just fill that out for me, huh? Staying more than one night? - Nope. - Oh, that's a shame. Second night's half price and we got great views around here. Yes, that'll do. Room number one. You won't have to go far. - Actually, I'd like a room away from the road. I'm a light sleeper. - Sure. Room 17. All the way in the back. - Great. Well, at least I finally got a place on my own, huh? - Oh, yes. - I need to know if there's anybody in the room adjacent to mine. - Jacent? - The room next to mine. - Oh, I can't necessarily give out that information. - I need to get into that room. - Miss Allen? It seems like we have a problem with the room. I have to switch you. - Did she have a car? - Yeah. It was right over there. She must have gone out. - What kind of car did she have? We have a problem. - I saw a murder-- - You know why I stopped you? - I saw someone kill-- - Again. Do you know why I stopped you? - No. - Got a report of a stolen vehicle, matching your description. - What? This is my car. Whatever my fiance-- - License? Elizabeth Allen. Gonna have to take you down to the station. - Officer, listen, I saw someone kill a woman at that-- - You can tell me all about it down at the station. - What about my car? - Lock it up. Tow truck will be by. You just stay put. Miss Allen, would you please come with me? It's okay. - Hello, Elizabeth. - I'm not even from here. I won't say anything, I promise. I didn't even see anything. - You know, whenever I have one of these little accidents, I generally have to dig just a small grave. But it looks like I'm gonna have to dig one big enough for two. Elizabeth, meet Jenny. I hope the two of you get along very well, because you're gonna spend eternity together. Fuck! Oh it's you. What happened to you? Okay, so tell me this again. A little slower this time. I went to the motel that you told me about, then I just went to my car to get some water and peeped in the room next door and saw a man strangle a woman while they were, you know. - Are you sure you saw what you saw? I mean, maybe she was into it. - Oh, then what about the Sheriff, huh? A shallow grave with my name on it. People got nothin' to do out here. You never know what's gonna happen. They get drunk, dig shallow graves and fuck with strangers. Wait wait wait wait. I'll take your word for it. There are some sick fucks out here. - I just wanna get out of here. - I'll drive you to your car tomorrow. I gotta shower. I smell like pancakes and old man hands. - How many men can you put on this? - None. - What? - Budget cuts. I'm the only officer on tonight. Deputy tomorrow. - Oh, shit. All right, we're gonna have to bring in the reserves. - The fucktards? - Yeah! You know, they may be fucktards but they get the job done. Bring in Toto and The Nub. ♫ What you want, what you want ♫ Come, come ♫ What you want, what you want ♫ Ah, fuck. - Hey let's just call it. - Call what? - Call it a night before you lose any more money. - When I start a game, I finish it. - Fine. Hey, you guys hustled us. - Pay, or we're gonna kick your ass. You old fucks? - Oh yeah, with what, your walkers? - God damnit. Okay, break it up. - Yeah, but they-- - Do you have a hearing problem? - He bit my fucking ear! - I guess you do have a hearing problem. Get the fuck outta here! - Jesus Christ. - What the hell do you want? - I detect some piss and vinegar in your voice. - Today is Donny's birthday. - I didn't know you two were the sentimental type. You live in the past, you die in it. - You shouldn't have killed him. - He shouldn't, uh, reached for my gun. You wanna fight about the past, or talk about the future? - What do you got? - You feel like killin' a girl? - Oh no, I don't drink. - Just take a sip. It'll calm your nerves. Not bad, right? - Mm. - Dr. Goode, you are so generous. With this check we'll be able to get the new equipment and uniforms that we need. You're such a decent man. - And I've got the first jersey right here. - Oh, she wants to tell you something. - What's that? - I've dreamed of playing soccer all winter. Now I can because of you. - Look into the camera. Okay so we've been here and here. - I don't know, I got pulled over somewhere around here. - Well are you sure? 'Cause everything looks like road or a desert. - I don't know. How am I going to get out of here then? - Well there's a train station two hours that way. That can get you home. I have the night shift tonight, but I'm free tomorrow. Chip in for gas and I'll take you there. - Okay, but what about the meantime? I just don't feel safe. - How's this make you feel? - Uh, no. I don't believe in guns. - When you're out in the middle of nowhere, and you got some drunk redneck chasing you with a knife and a hard on, it'll make you a believer. Take your time. Focus on the target. Then squeeze. How was that? Fucking awesome. - Try it again. - Okay. - Billy Weaver is playing at the fair next month. - How? The guy's only got six fingers. - It's four fingers and two thumbs, actually. Whatever. I can't believe it, a guy with six fingers playing the guitar at the fair, and we're not. - So you're not going? - No, man. No. - Last time I went I got three t-shirts and two chilli dogs for five bucks. Knock yourself out, buddy. Where's that damn Goode? - He's always late. His watch must be broken. - Those chilli dogs, were they kosher? - Foot long. - Foot long? So you get three t-shirts, two chilli dogs, for five bucks you say? - Uh-huh. - That's too damn good to pass up, man. - Great, now that you're going I don't have to take the bus. - Here comes that asshole now. - Have you apprised them of the situation? - So how is that band coming along, Toto? - Quit the shit and let's get down to business. - Her name's Elizabeth Allan. - Is she from around here? - No. - Where was she last seen? - 150th and garden, and I don't her to leave this town. - Oh, you mean... - Did I say I want her dead? - Look, you gotta be crystal clear about this shit. You remember the Sandy incident. - Oh, I remember. And you keep this tinned-his-rabbits motherfucker in check. - Dead or alive? So what is it? - Alive. I want to talk to her. - She's kind of pretty. Care to break bread? - Just fucking find her. - Hey. We got this. Yeah. Come on, what's took us so fuckin' long? Come on. Get on, Nub. Okay, what's the deal? Are you coming with me to work or are you gonna stay here? - I think I'm gonna stay. Okay, get some sleep. You need it. - Okay. - Excuse me, have you seen a young brunette about this tall? From out of town? - I don't think so, nope. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Have you seen a young brunette about this tall, from out of town? - Nope. - Are you sure? - Positive. - Let's go. Have you seen a young brunette about this tall, from out of town? - No. Sorry. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I mean I see a lot of people in one week. Maybe she came in but, I don't remember. - Really? - Positive. - Okay. Thanks. - Well, I wanted to see the country. - Where is she? - Who? - Elizabeth Allen, you know where she is. - I said she could shower and had to split. - Bullshit! - I swear. Stay! - Fuck you, asshole! - God, I didn't see you there. - Didn't mean to scare ya. - Oh, no that's okay. I need to get out of the sun anyway. - My name is Frankie but people call me The Nub. - The Nub? - It's not 'cause of my fingers. I got a teenie weenie. - Not sure you should be telling people that. - You're very pretty, Elizabeth. - Well, thank you you, Frankie. You have a nice day now, okay? - Okay. - Jules, where are you? - Open the door, I'm in the closet! Help me. Open the door. - Two creepy guys are looking for you. - I know, I just met one. Believe me now? - Yeah. Let's get out of here. - What the fuck, man? We're out here looking for the girl and you're taking a sunbath. - I found her. - You found her? - I played nice this time. No more Sandy incidents. - Well where the fuck is she? - She didn't wanna get sunburn. - Oh, man. You fuckin' moron. Come on! - Okay, okay. - Come on. Come on. - There she is, Toto. - Sure did it this time, Elizabeth. - Don't talk like that. - I shouldn't have gotten you into this mess. - Hey, this ain't the first time I've been in a shit storm. One thing you can't do is lose your cool. - What should we do? - Well, we can't stay here for one. - So get to the train station? - Yeah, and then what? I shot a guy. - In self-defense. - Do you think they're gonna believe me? The Sheriff was ready to put you in a shallow grave. - We can go to the next town. Tell the cops there. - If the Sheriff here is in on it, who knows who else is, and who do you think they're gonna believe, us or another cop? - I just wanna get out of here. Wake up from this crazy dream. - Quit talking like that. This is survival, live or die. How far away is home? - Four, five hours maybe? - Looks like I'm taking a road trip and you're headed home. - The quicker I'm out of here, the better. - I gotta fuel up and then adios, assholes. - Yes, I have you down for 2:30. Bye-bye. - I need to see Dr. Goode. - Oh, actually he's not in today, but you can see Dr. Melin. Just get him. - What the fuck is this? Never come to my place of business. - You gotta fix me up. - Oh, shit. I can't do this here. Come on. - Hi. What's your name? - I'm Juan. - Good afternoon, Juan. - Good afternoon, miss. - It's Mrs. Do the pipes need cleaning? - They're a little backed up but, it's nothing that can't be taken care of. - Do you like my tits? Yes. Would you like to touch them? - Yes. - Do you think I'm pretty? - Yes. - Would you like to fuck me? - Oh, yes. - You're fired, get the fuck out of here! How dare you! - You know, this is a pretty serious injury. You're gonna have to rest up and change your bandages twice a day. - Good thing I got my own doctor. - Go home and stay home. You're done. - I'm not finished. - Oh, you're finished. This wouldn't have happened five years ago. You really need to think about a career change. - Nuh-uh, no way. Here. You and Sling Blade are out. Take some of those, they'll make you feel better. - What's going on? - It's private. - I'm your wife. There's nothing private. - A little early to be drinking, isn't it? - Who said I ever stopped? - So, you all fixed up? - Good as I can be. - So, where do we look for those girls now? - We're not. - Huh? - We're done. Our services are no longer needed. We've been paid in full. - Well if we've been paid, that's all that matters. A job well done. - No, man. We didn't finish what we started. - I don't finish what I start sometimes. Remember when I was with that girl at Miss Fifi's? - You know what? Let's go get fuckin' wasted. We got paid. - I wanna get laid. - Okay, buddy. Let's go see Miss Fifi. - Where the music stinks and they water the drinks, but you can do a shot of rum off a girl's bum. ♫ Only at Miss Fifi's ♫ - Yeah? - Did you find that girl? - Well what about the fucktards? - They fucked up. - I can't, it's just me and the deputy, and I've got a murder I'm looking-- - After all I've done for you. Fucker. - Fuckin' asshole just hung up on me. Guess who's getting a parking ticket tomorrow. - What is it? - I don't know. - Good afternoon, ladies. Car trouble? Mind if I take a look? - Nothing we can't handle. - If he wants to help... - Guess it can't hurt. I think all you have to do-- - Wait, someone-- - Wake up. - He's dead. - I didn't mean to kill. - Fuck him. Fuck him. What. Better him than us. You think he was just gonna let us go? After he did what he did? Anything can happen out here and nobody will know or care. Uh, Daddy? - What the hell do you want? - I have a problem. - I don't give a shit about your problems. Hold on, let me check my diaper. Oh, actually I do give a shit. - I killed another one. - You did what I taught you to do, son. - Well, another girl saw me do it. - Saw you? - She got away. - You're a big disappointment to me, son. If your mother was here, I don't know what she'd think about all this. - Well, Taggart's undermanned and he can't go look for her. - Then have you wife light a fire under his ass! Well, won't she be upset with me? - Just do it! - There you go. - Thanks. - How did we end up here? - Let the road take us here, I guess. - I've been working at that diner ever since I was able to. The road outside the window. I see it every day. It can take me wherever I wanna go. And I take it to work. To a job I hate. And for what? To pay rent. To buy wine. - Same road brought me here. - Just takin' the road. - It'll take us back if we let it. - What do you mean? - I don't know if I wanna go home. - Then what do you have in mind? - We need proof. - Proof. - Yeah, get proof that this guy killed that girl. - Okay, do you remember who he was? - Uh, no. - Do you remember where he was trying to bury you? - No. - Anything you do remember? - The motel room we rented. - All right, that's a good start. - What about him though? - Let the vultures get him. - Hey you! Come on if you want a ride. - We got a problem. - Yeah, what's that? - I have this vice. This urge that I can't control sometimes, and it's gotten me into a lot of trouble this time. - You mean your prostitutes. - You know. - Yeah. - Well why didn't you say anything? - Because I don't really give a fuck as long as you pay the bills around here. - It's a little more complicated than that. I accidentally killed one them, and a woman saw me do it. - Pay her off. - That's not an option. - Well get somebody to take care of her. Oh, that's what the goons were here for, huh? That's right, but they fucked up. - Well then you get your ass out there and do it yourself! - Honey, if I go down, all of this goes with me. - The house? - Yeah. - My jewelry? - Uh-huh. - Even my drinks? - Well, with those tits, you'll never have to buy your own drinks. You're right. But I need this stuff, what's my brother doing about this? - Oh, he's got budget cuts and he's only got one deputy on duty right now. - That fucker! - So what do you wanna do about it? - I wanna get my brother's ass in gear, and find that bitch and kill her! - That's my girl. Come on. - See something you like? - Just checkin' for rats. - See one right in front of me. - Is there something I can do for you? - I rented a room the other night, remember me? - Can't say I do. I rent plenty of rooms. I see plenty of people. - Listen asshole, I know you remember me and you remember who rented the room next to me. - Got a fuzzy memory. - How fuzzy is it now? - Yeah, it's getting clearer but there's still plenty of static. - How about now? - Okay, okay! His name is Goode. Dr. Goode. Runs an office in town. Richest man here. He has a brother in law who's the Sheriff. Don't mess with him. Bitches, take my advice. Get out of town. Quick! - Let's go. - Yeah? - Guy in the office is peeping on you. - What the fuck do you think you're doin', man? What the fuck-- - Danny? - It's Sheriff Taggart. - Whatever! Why aren't you out there looking for that bitch? - I assume you mean the woman who saw one of your husband's accidents. - That is exactly what I mean. - As you can see, I've got a murdered body here. I've got a job to do. Not clean up hubby's dirty laundry. - Do you think I'm a bitch? - You can be. - Well I'm gonna be turning into a super bitch because if my husband loses everything, whose door do you think I'm gonna be knocking on to stay with? That's right. So I'm a bitch, you're a bitch, and you better go out there and find that bitch right now! Now get out there! - Hi, good afternoon. Do you have an appointment? - Uh, no. No, I do not. I was hoping to see Dr. Goode. - Oh, you know you're the second person to ask today but actually he's not here. You can see Dr. Melin. - Sure. - Okay, go into waiting room four and a nurse will be right with you. - Okay. - Dr. Goode? Yeah hi, um, this is weird, but I have another person, a woman in here, asking for you without an appointment? Oh hi, Dr. Goode. - Where is she? - Uh, room four. - Things are going as planned. Just be ready. I'm almost there. - It's a trap, get out! I'd like them alive. - What the fuck? We're shooting to kill. Now let's kill those bitches! - Come on, I found a way out, this way. Go, go. - Where'd the god damn hill come from? - Great plan, genius. - Well it wasn't here when I bought the place. Come on, let's go get 'em. - They following us? - I don't see them. But it doesn't mean they're aren't far behind. - Any idea where we're headed? Maybe I should ask for directions. Oh, don't give me shit. Do not give me shit. I'm winging this, all right? - Well, all of our plans seem to go out the window. - Bitch, please. I'm running on instinct. Shh. - You hear something? We should go. - Can we take a break? My feet are killin' me. - Your fucking feet? How do you think it feels to lug these things around? - Do you think we're on the right trail? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I'm a Sheriff, not a tracker. - Honey, don't forget, we are going to my mom's house this Saturday. - Oh, god damnit. Didn't we just see her? - That was for Thanksgiving. This is her birthday. - Oh, jeez. It's just that she gets so grabby. I mean, and don't forget that, you know, "Oh, I didn't know you were in the shower" act. - So what? She saw your pecker, big deal. And it's not a very big deal, believe me. - I don't care if she sees my pecker. I just don't wanna have to eat her potato salad. - And what's wrong with her potato salad? - Well besides having hair in it, she likes to serve it personally. I mean, taking her 90-year-old boobs and pressing them up against my back, and her cheese breath on my neck. - You know which way we're headed? - No. - Let's head back. - The way we came? - Yeah. - I thought they went that way. - Trust me, it'll play to our advantage. - All right. - Think they gave up? - Not likely. - Keep heading the way we're headed then? - Sounds like a plan. - You have very pretty hair. - Thank you. - I miss Donny. He said he was gonna kill Taggart 'cause of what he did. - Truth be told, Donny was a dumb-ass. - But you said-- - I know what I said. - I know what you said, no more Sandy incidents, but her hair was so pretty, I just wanted to pet it. I didn't mean it. - I know you didn't mean it. Now let's get out of here before someone spots us. Let's go visit Donny. After we pay our respects, we should jam out in Donny's honor. That sounds like a good idea, buddy. We can get Jojo and Bobby. I bet-- - I'm dying for some water. - Mm-hm. Oh my god. Civilization. - I hope they're hospitable. - Yeah. - I don't wanna get up. - Bitch, don't make me drag you. Come on. - No. - Come on. - Five more minutes. Come on! - I'm not done yet. Fuck Goode. When I start something, I finish it. I'm gonna finish this game. I'm gonna finish it. Fuck Goode, I'm not done. I'm not done. Fuck Goode. Fuck him. When I start something, I finish it. I finish it. I finish this game. Fuck Goode. I'm gonna finish the game. - Hello, bitches. - Can I ask you a question? Why did you watch me? Voyeur? Curious. Aroused. I must admit, I got turned on by it. After the fact, of course. - You're sick. - Am I? We all have our urges. Late night raid on the cookie jar, banging the neighbor's spouse, peeping through the peephole. - You're a doctor, how can you do this? - I've killed many women, accidentally, and I take no pleasure in their deaths, but I have this urge where I need to wrap my hands around their throats while I engage them physically. And it's just something I have to do, and I've got that urge now and I'm having a very, very difficult time suppressing it. - This can't go on anymore. I can't cover for him again. - Remember if he goes down, I lose all of this. - I was thinking, what if he's not around anymore? - What are you getting at? - Well, what if he dies a natural death? - Oh, you mean like an accident? - Something where he dies honorably, and these urges die with him. He's never gonna stop. Eventually he's gonna do down and take us with him. - Well what would you suggest we do? - Let him satisfy his urge tonight. We can start planting our seed tomorrow. - Okay but the bitches still die, right? - Yeah. Well, you can't have witnesses walking the earth. This is her, huh? - Yes. - Oh, yes. She's a nice one. She reminds me of your mother. - Yeah. - God rest her soul! Wow, would you look at those. - Nice, right? - Oh yes, plump, appetizing. I do love me some titties! - Got a nice set yourself, you sick fuck. Hey! Where are your manners? Have some respect for your elders. Dad! - Can't I? - I said the neck only. - Oh, come on! - Oh, all right. You bitch! Come on, Dad. But, but her boobies! I know. - I wanted to touch her boobies. Later. I wanted to touch her boobies. - You're so beautiful. What a lovely face. I've been meaning to get a nip and a tuck. But what I really want is this. Oh, your skin is so soft and lively. I've heard rumors of wearing another's skin. It gets rid of wrinkles and sagging. Gives you a real glow. I've heard of queens bathing in the blood of young girls. Just to become young again. I wonder if it works. Maybe I should give it a try. Damn, I can't do it. I'm not strong enough. - I may actually regret killing you. I mean, the others, they were accidents. But you? This is premeditated. You don't really deserve this. - You don't have to do this. It's not too late to stop. Just do it! - Something to remember you by. Catatonic, eh? Doesn't make any difference to me. Ow! - Lights out, asshole. You okay? I found a handful of women driver's licenses. Enough to make the cops suspicious. - Oh, shit. - Chick's got a pretty good gun here. Makes himself dinner, wine. Does he offer any? No. What shit manners. Let's see what he's got to eat in here. - I have to get my gun. - Cheese. Who freezes cheese? Oh, mayo. Here we go. - Go. - Wake up. - What happened? You tell me. - Oh! - Oh, you know what I like. Do it again. Harder this time! Crack my walnuts. - I don't have time for this shit. - Out the way, Danny. What the fuck? - Give me the big one. - Really? - We're goin' on a bitch hunt, come on. Dad, what happened? - It was those bitches. - I'll get 'em for you, Dad. No wait, I need changing! Let's finish this. Goode! Where are you? - Jules. Please let me see. Just let me see. - No, just go, just leave, just go. Just leave. - You're right, I should. - What? - It's pretty bad. I don't want you to slow me down. - Bullshit, I can make it. - I know. You bitch. - Quit stalling, let's go. - Any sign of 'em? - Your guess is as good as mine. I hit one. They'll be moving slow. - Split up. - Hey! - What? - Be careful where you're going. Whoa. I need to sit. - Okay. - That bullet went clean through. Maybe it's not as bad as it feels. They're not gonna stop until they kill us. You gotta take them down. - How many bullets we got? - Three. - There's three of them. - Better make 'em count. - Toto, what the fuck are you doing here? - Finishing the game. - What game? This is for Donny. - Somebody whacked this mofo. - Looks like they're turned on themselves. - Wait. - What? Might as well give them my address. Just leave me. I'll only slow you down. It's okay. - No, I have an idea. - Oh, Danny. - Hey. I got him. Hey. Hey, wake up. Oh my god, don't you die on me. God, I thought you were dead. - Can't a girl grab a cat nap? Okay okay, enough warmth. - Oh my god. You bitch! - Hello, bitch. So you were acting catatonic, and then? - Then I bit his ear and kneed him in the face. All right, good for you. - That's not the best part. Then I smashed in the face with a lamp and said, "Lights out, asshole." - You didn't. Seriously? - Yep. - Lights out, asshole. Lights out. - Shit, we're out of bullets. - He's not. - Well let's change that. - I see where you're going, come on. - Shit. - He's out. - Let's just hope he doesn't have another clip. - Jules! - Come and get it, dipshit. Come on, come on. - Bitch. - Well I guess it's finally over. I have had enough of this shit! - Come on, come on. - You get any more wine at home? - Hell yeah. Good. I think I'm gonna drink the whole bottle. Wasn't that guy's hair black? Yeah, it's a bad dye job. It looked terrible. I told you, people do crazy shit out here. So what's your deal? You wanna know more about me? Well, that's a whole other story. - Which way? - It depends. Where do you wanna go? - We need to get you to a doctor first. That's that way. - Let's go. - Then where? Home? - No. - Where then? - Anywhere but here. - Sounds good to me. - Nice boobies, both of them. Oh, those boobies. I'm gonna find them. I want them. I want those boobies. I got to have those boobies. Ah yes.
