Let them go. Come on, you take this. You're careless. Do you want to eat? No. Bring an umbrella with you, it's raining. Let's go. You and I are different. You don't have to flatter me.

Yes. You'd better go. What did you say? The police ... You must have got into his nerve. He's not a rough man, just go away. Hey, stop that, no. Come on, I give you a free ride. Sister. Yes? Can I ask you a favor? Sorry, I won't do that. Only once! I beg you. What for? I want to send it to the press contest. Is that okay? Yes. Are you sure no one's around? Yes. What's wrong? Just one time, just once. What? I'm begging you. I'm the only vingin in class. You are doing it anyway. You're too young for that. Please, just once. What are you doing? Nothing at all. I bought you this, it's good. Come on, right. What's this? Good job. You'll be famous one day. Your painting is good, how's the business? Leave me alone. I even bought you mandarins. You better give me the money before I beat you up. No. What? You're dead if I find it. What's this? Rubbish? Come here. Come here, don't move. I want to screw you whenever I see you. What the hell?! What a shit! Sister, can I come in? Yes. I want to take a look at the goldfish. It's getting bigger. Photos are ready. They're good though. Can you just throw it away? I'll send it. Maybe I'll win the prize. Sister... What? You're so beautiful. You better get out. Hyun-woo, give me... Go back to your room. Can I do it again? Please ... No way, you did it already. Now, you ... I'm leaving then. Better go to your room. You're a student! Why you're touching my stuff? Be careful. Mom, I want to buy a walkman. I need that for learning English. Use young's one. Ho won't lend it to me. I've asked him. I don't have money. I'll buy it next time. I want it now. Maybe later. Please. No, stop that. Just sleeping together. How can I trust you. You can trust me. Really? Take off your clothes too. No! Let's go. I'm not used to this kind of place. Then just lie down. Come on. Come over. I can't stand it. You can check it out. Are you crazy? I do mean it. I'm not a whore. What's wrong? Making love means intimacy. I do this because I love you. Right, but I'm not ready yet. Maybe I will if we get married but not now, you get it? You men are all animals. You're right. That's because of our hormones. I don't feel quite right too. Hey! Cheong, it's me. The place you told me last time. Yeah, crowded with chicks. Here you go. You came here for sex? Can I use your phone? Sure. Sorry, I do love you. We can do it everyday after wedding. Mom, the client's gone? Yes, quick one. How did he look like? Can't remember. I didn't give a shit. He's okay. Why? Just asking. Thanks, mom. Sorry about this morning. Mom, no more tissues and condoms. Use it wisely. Give me a break, mom. When will I end this kind of life? That's annoying. How long do I have to eat with this kind of people? What else we can do? We started this business when you were young. This is the only stuff I know, Ji-yeon want to visit us tonight. Can you ... Today? I don't mind if he knows we're poor instead of knowing that we run that kind of business. Ji-na, can you come back late in the night? . Ji-yeon My parents run a motel, come in. Ok. Come in. Thanks. Mom. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Please come in. Hi, there. No, not now. You're so handsome. I like you. Mom, I'd like to eat. Give me the rice. Ji-yeon, this is my cousin who works for us. Yeah. Wanna know what I do? What is it? Sex. I've got to stay with those lonely guys, I'm paid to make love to them. 50,000 for one time, and overnight is ... Am I right, mom? That's truth. You god damn bitch! How can you treat us like that?! I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I really am. But I feel so guilty... Everytime you wanted to come over... I know that, it's not your fault. You take life so simply. Not everyone can do it like you. Do you think I'm happy? Do you really understand me? Stop that! That's what you ask for. Stop behaving like in the movie. So what if he knows? Did he want to break up? He won't break up with me for such little thing. Is it? That's good. But I think, I've seen him before. Who gave you this? From Ji-yeon? You bought me this, didn't you? Me? Be honest. Is this the first time you come there? I don't mean that you're ... but my mom said she've seen you before. I saw shoes like yours in my house a few days ago. I've been there, but nothing happened. Really?! Who do you take me for?! Don't try to fool me! Nothing! You can ask her. Whatever, you're not forgiven for going there! It's rubbish! All men will do that! They will pay for that! I did pay but I did nothing! You better ask her. Tell her everything. Is it necessary? Go away. Tell her if we did it or not. Is that so important? The truth. I don't care whether you did it or not. Just go away. I don't want to see you again. We did it twice. He also said I had a great body. What's that? Why are you lying? You like sad endings? Tell her it was a lie! I envy you. I don't have someone to talk to. Hye-mi, she's lying, I didn't do it! Let go. Don't be mad, Hye-mi! Trust me! You've got to believe me! Go away! I didn't do it. Hye-mi! Take this back. I won't take this walkman! I've been longing for that. I won't take anything from the whore. Hye-mi ... Anyone here? Looking for rooms? No, someone reported you're running a brothel here. What? We need to check it out. What's your relationship? Miss, I.D. card please. Listen, sir. Someone reported this, we have to do it. You're staying here today. Don't need. You're not alone in this. We all are. Sister, dad and Ji-na got caught. You still have your appetite. It's not the first time though ... You're really too much. Who could report it? Is it the one got beaten up by dad? We better stop doing that. Can you support us? Are you the one who reported it? Cause Ji-na didn't treat you good? Is it true? Really? Don't hit me. You gave nothing to me. I'm afraid of bringing friends home, do you know why? Cause they're gossiping about me. I lost my face, got that? You're not a kid now. You should understand that we do that for living. You're still young ... You get your injection first. Next one. Is it done? Almost. Hye-mi, come and get one too. Is it looks alike? Mom, I have to talk with you and it's very important. What's about? I've seen Hyun-woo always hanging with Ji-na. Is it? Don't you trust me, mom? I do, he's ... Don't be mad, try to talk to him. Do the check-up tomorrow! Mom. Now tell me, did you go to Ji-na's room? I send you to school to learn this? You want to run a brothel too? Come here, what did you do to my son? You have to reject those minors. You shouldn't blame sister! Shut up! I've mercy to keep you here. Behave yourself or you'll be outta here! That bitch seduced you, isn't it? You didn't go to her room purposely! That's enough! What? Enough? That bitch seduced your son! Should I be still silent? Go to your room. What...? Maybe...? Maybe she seduced you too?! You ...! From now on you won't argue with me for those little things. Are you leaving cos I scolded you?! How can you do that to me? You should stay here till I'll find another one. Take this to her room. Where can I buy this watch? We're off at noon. I'm looking for Hyun-woo. Yes? I'm pleased with your photo. The angle is good ... Am I in? Not sure now... Cause you gave us one photo only. You're talented so I'm here for you. What should I do now? Did you keep your negative? Ok! I'll pay for the negative. We will discuss this later. You'll sure have your chance. Take this, it's 100,000. Then, you need my negative now? You're smart, you can be a reporter. Better start now. I thought the hooker I meet will have big tits, great body. Stop this nonsense, do it quick. OK, OK... Why don't you scream? Lounder! The one next door need to go to school. It's good to be grown up here. Can have fun. Did you do this with the college student? You still keep talking about that. Okay, I stop. Spread your legs wider. Thanks for forgiving me. We can do it? No, not now. I want to wait till we get marry. I respect you and love you. That bitch. You bitch. How can you do that? How much did you get for this? You're not an actress. What the hell you think you are? I can dump you anytime. Taking this kind of photo will affect our business. How much did you get? I'm not paid. What? Are you nuts? Posing nude for nothing? What do you think I am? You should get 10,000,000 at least. Hey! Bitch. I didn't get paid for that! Who took the photo? I'll find money there! Don't know. You bitch, come here! Fucking bitch! You're so generous? Tell me! Stop that, what did Ji-na do? Punk! You don't have right to hit Ji-na! Who are you? Get lost! You get lost or I'll call the police! Shit. My girl pose for nude photos. I'm mad about that. Now I won't go after the magazine. I just want to get my share. That's none of your business! Are you a man?! Why didn't you let Ji-na go? Get out! You have to be fixed. Come here, bitch. I'll fix you up! Stop it! I'll give you money tomorrow! Why didn't you say that earlier? You can't get away from me. What? I have nothing to do with this. Shit, it's bad luck. I'm sorry. Sorry, sister. It's my fault. Silly. What? It's your hand now? Don't try to fool me! Come with me. Fuck! I'll be back. What's up with your eyes? Your eyes look shit! Fuck you! You're not so tough as I heard. What do you want to tell me? Say it out, what is it? My son took those photos. Your son? He got cheated by the magazine. Then you pay me, fucking head! Ji-na's earning for me! You screwed her, right? Get up! What did she do here? Say it! Fuck! Everyone goes after me? You don't fix the boats today? You're mine, no one can take you away. Right? Shit. Last time I bought you mandarines, remember? I really mean it. Why do I want to screw you when I see you? Did Ji-yeon really do it? I would if I were a man. You're so beautiful. But I feel strange about myself. Really strange. Come in. Anyone here? Here comes the client. Wait, I take care of him. You didn't have a good rest. Call me if he's looking for chicks. Any room available? Take this one. Any chicks? Yes. Are you? How much? Just a second.
