- Good morning. Morning. Morning! Morning. Mm-mm, this one, hm? Good morning, Mr. Richard. - Karen. Good morning. It's lovely to see you. - It's lovely to see you, too. How you feeling today? - I'm good, thanks. - So, what are we writing? - Nothing special. It's just the ramblings of an old madman. - Yeah, I've said this before. And I'm gonna say it again. You do not belong here. - Maybe not. But I'd rather be in here than the alternative. - What's your alternative? - Death, doom, destruction. Now you're beginning to rethink my sanity? - I think you should write poetry. Dark poetry. - Well, you think I'm a loony, which is why I'm in here. - I still don't believe that. Mr. Richard, how did you really end up in here? - You wouldn't believe me. Truth can be stranger than fiction. - I just got off work, so I have time. Let's talk. Try me. - All right. My story begins... It was early as my first memory as a child. - Richard? Richard, baby. It's time to get up. Hey, okay, come, up you get. Time to take your bath. My baby. Yeah. Ah, good morning, my baby. He's almost getting too heavy for Mommy to carry, now. - An astronaut. Or a pilot. But I'm afraid of heights. So, no. If you want, we could fix that. - Oh. - We could fly, or even better. We could go to space. Everything is possible here, Richard. Say the word, I'll make it happen. - It sounds like you just want to see me throw up. I'll make sure it matter first. Ah, Sylvia, I almost forgot. I'm having serious issues with my math homework. I asked Mom, but-- - Already solved. - Thank you, Sylvia. Sometimes, I wonder what I would do without you. - You're welcome. No big deal, really. - Someone's about to wake me up, right? - Come to me as soon as you can, okay? Yes, what is it? Don't you hear the bell? Get up now. I'll save you a spot behind me on the queue if you hurry up. I just really miss her. - You should, Richard. She was an amazing woman. - I don't get it. The potion that you gave me and asked me to give her. Why didn't it work? Why didn't she get better? - I don't know, Richard. I guess it was her time to go. There are some things that even I don't have control over. - Yes, at least she's at rest now. - She got to see you graduate, get your Master's, a great job, and finally move into your own place. She was more than impressed with you, Richard. She was proud. - I don't suppose your powers include the power of resurrecting people? I guess not. - You have to leave soon. You have to leave soon. - Why? - Because you drank a little too much water last night, and it's almost 6:00 a.m., your time. - I've been meaning to ask you why you keep giving me these. - Because it matters to me. - You matter to me. - Nobody drink yet. First, a toast, hm? Here's to one of the brightest, most resourceful, talented minds I have had the pleasure of working with. Richard Okezie, who landed us our largest account yet, Zephyr Heights. Let him hear it! Yes, yes, yes. And to me, for being crazy enough to put this rookie on the board. - To our very own Don Draper, Mr. Temidayo Davies. - Ah, please stop. - Save a letter for you. - Come on, calm down. We're here to celebrate Richard over here, not me. I mean, who am I anyway? Only the man that can fire each and every one of you. I know I am talking too much, because some of you alcoholics want a drink really badly. I see you, John. Patience, okay? Just one last thing, and that'll be it, hm? Please don't spill anything on my floor. Or I will fire you, that's a promise, all right? To Richard! To Richard! - Well done. Lemme talk to you real quick. - Thanks, guys. - Well done. Drink up. Richard, my man. Well done. - Thank you. - You know what? Go ahead and take the day off. - Are you serious? - Yes, go ahead and take the day off. Believe me, you have earned it. Besides, it is Friday, so no harm in starting the weekend early, hm? - Oh, I'll drink to that. - Yes, sir, a drink to that! - All right! Richard, my man. Mm, gotta sip on it. Hey, how you doing, all right? Yes. - Do you have plantain? - Yes, I do. - I'll have some fried rice. - What would you like? Yes, sir? Fried rice with what? Excuse me, sir? Excuse me, sir? - Fried rice. - Just fried rice? - Sorry. Fried rice with plantain and beef. - And beef? - Yeah. Coming right away. - And some water. - Okay, sir. - Hi. - Hey. - Do you mind if I-- - Sure. - Sorry. Forgive me for staring. It's just... You must think I'm really creepy. You're in luck. I'm really creepy, too. - So, beauty and a sense of humor? Richard Okezie. - Gbemi Ogunlana. - Gbemi, it's so nice to meet you. So, you like her? I think that's not accurate. I love her! - So, what about us? What about us? - What we have, silly! - What do we have? - How can you say that? - Look, Sylvia. You of all people should've known that this day will come. - How am I supposed to know that the day would come where you would fall in love with somebody else? - What did you expect, that I would settle down with you? Have kids with you? You're not even real. - How can you say that, Richard? After everything, how could you honestly say that? Richard. Richard, look at me. Look at me, Richard, look at me. Look me in the eye and tell me that this isn't real. Tell me that we're not fated. Tell me that we're not meant to be together, Richard. Lie to me. - I'm sorry. Fine. Let's assume that it's all real. Even for a moment, what did you expect, that I'm gonna just leave everything and come out here, start a family with you, be with you? What about my other life? My real life, the real world? Am I supposed to just spend all the time sleeping just to be here with you? Sylvia. - What's wrong with the way that we've been spending time together? - Sylvia! It's not gonna work, it has to stop. - Don't touch me! I'm not real, right? So why are you feeling sorry for me if I am not real? I'm just somebody that you used. After everything that we have together, Richard. You'd throw that away? I may not be a real woman, but you will never find anyone like me. - Sylvia, I didn't-- - It's 6:00 a.m., Richard. You need to leave. - Hey. Stop crying. Just so sorry. Richard... it's just a dream. Get a-- - Grip on yourself, man! Dude, I've seen the way you look at her. I've seen how she makes you feel. You're a complete fool around her. You know what that means, right? - No, Obaro, what does it mean? Tell me. - It means she's the one. You know, the one? Like Neil, except with boobs and nice legs. - Hey! - Round ass. - Hey! All right, that's my wife-to-be you're talking about. - Well, there it is! Huh? That's what I'm talking about! Yeah. - Dude, I thought I'd lost you for a second. And I was beginning to wonder, wondering if you were gay or something. - Why would you think that I'm gay? - It's not like I have anything against gay people, I'm just saying. This is where teenagers come if they haven't really been interested in girls. - Yeah, well, I'm getting married to one now, okay? Does not convince you that I'm straight? I'm straight as it gets. No, it doesn't convince me, 'cause this is Lagos, and there are a lot of married men running around with kids and still keeping houseboys and stuff. - Really? How do you know all this stuff? I'm beginning to wonder if you're straight. Me? Obaro? I'm straighter than your ruler. I'm so straight, can't get any gayer. - Madman! - Oh, man! - Oh, Obaro. I'm getting married. - That's it. - I am getting married to the most incredible woman that I've ever actually met. - And don't you forget it, 'cause if you do, you know what's gonna happen, right? I'm gonna slide right in, take care of that ass for you. That's what's gonna happen. Oh, goodness. - You know what? I'm marrying Gbemi. It's final. Bro. - What are you doing? - I gotta-- - Dude, it's not even 10 yet. - I know. - Okay, one for the road, just one shot? Do a shot before you leave? - No. - You're not gonna leave me here by myself. - Come on, you'll be fine. - Richard! See you later, man. - I need new friends, that's what it is. - This is on the house. - Thank you. This, trying to mess up my night. That is not about to happen here. - I came to tell you that this has to end, Sylvia. I'm getting married to her next Saturday. - I know that. If I'm not real, it shouldn't matter what you do with me and to me in your dreams. - Sylvia, I'm sorry. I know that we had some good times, but things have changed. - Richard, nothing has to change. We can just stay here. - You know what, I've made me decision, and I'm sticking to it. Quite frankly, I don't care if you plague my dreams every night for the rest of my life. Please. - I am marrying Gbemi. I love her. Please, take it! - And that's that. Please Richard, take it. - No. - You have to! - No, I don't! Take it, Richard, please! You don't understand. If you don't take it, then, you have to. - Then what? You what? - If you don't take it, then I might not be able to see you. - Might? Or won't? - I love you, Richard. From the first day you took your first breath, I have loved you. I haven't loved anybody else. Richard. You are mine, and nothing and nobody is going to take that away from me, do you understand? I love you. So you can go and you can get married to someone else, you get to try and live your life, but I will always find my way back into your heart. Oh, I will use the whole of eternity trying. Do you understand? - I might understand that if I don't take that from you, I won't see you again. Please. - I'll take that as a yes. - Take it. Richard, please! - I am done with this madness! - Please! Richard! - I don't know why you don't like reading the soft copies. Because I like the feel of paper. Is that coffee I smell? Strong and hot, just the way you like it. - How did you know I needed this? It's perfect. - Well, I aim to please. The doomsayer. - Thank you. - So, is there anything else you want me to do you for, sir? - Yes, as a matter of fact, there is. I want you... to help me call a very good florist. Have him deliver a bouquet of flowers to my wife. - Little problem, Mr. Okezie. - And I want it delivered to her at work. Okay. - So, here's the address, and here's the message I want on the card. She's gonna love this. - To the reason my life is worth living. P.S., honeymoon tonight. Wow, lucky woman. I thought you already had your honeymoon. - Boundaries, Hawa. - Yeah, and I'll leave you to it. Oh, what kind of flowers do you want sent to her? - Just have the florist surprise us. Oh, but I do know that she only likes one type of flower in her bouquet. Make sure he gets that. - Okay, sir. Good day, Mrs. Iweta. - Good day, Hawa. I take it he is in. - Oh, I'm afraid Mr. Okezie isn't in. - So I see. You have a habit of just shoving your head into his office and talking to thin air? - Actually, my psychotherapist says it's unhealthy to act sane all the time. - It is a wonder that you can be so successful, considering the shoddy way assistant's handling his services to his clientele. - Actually, we are very successful, considering we don't talk this way to people who actually matter. - Your insolence, young lady, may have just cost No Box Incorporated one of its biggest clients. - If you'll excuse me, ma'am, I'm very busy right now. I'll be sure to tell Mr. Okezie that you swore on the Bible. Please book an appointment next time so that you don't waste your time. Good day. - Oh. May I have the drainer please? - I am so exhausted. Where do you want that? - There, that's fine. - Can we swap jobs? No really, come on. Hm? I'd kill to be home by 4:30. I'd cook, I'd even cook, I'd do the cooking. - Nope, you love your job. And I love my kids. - True. You left one more person out. - Hm? - Come on! - Who is that? - It's not obvious? - Who? - Me. You? - You love me? - Hm, no. Not even a little bit. - Liar. - How's work? I don't know. Kinda hit a stumbling blow. - Yeah? - I'm having issues trying to come up with direction of taking the new Zephyr Heights company. And it's doing me in. - Anything I can do to help? - Mm-hmm. Love me. Feed me. Never leave me. - That, I can do. - So, what are we having? I'm really hungry, I'm starving. You know, the kind of starving that's-- Richard, what's wrong? - Baby, they sent you red hibiscuses? Mm-hmm. Clearly, you didn't choose which ones. - No, it's not that, it's just I don't know anything about flowers. But these don't look fresh, though. I think we should throw them out. I'll make new arrangements. - You just said you knew nothing about flowers, silly. They're fine. - Quite frankly, sir, I don't think I understand. - How do I make this clearer? This, it's not what we're looking for. - Help me understand exactly what your company wants. - We've already told you. Understated elegance. - Which is exactly what my team and I have prepared for you. Did you only look at the files, or were you able to look at the email presentation? - We've seen the presentation and the files, Mr. Okezie. Whatever elegance may be in the campaign you came up with is a little too understated. - So, you'd rather have it a little less understated? - All I know is, you're the ad guy, and we hired you to make us look good. We all agree, we don't like this pitch. Figure it out. - I'm very sure that my team and I can come up with something that suits Zephyr. - Tick-tock, no pressure, though. - You know about my kid I'm always telling you is good at everything else but math? He did so well on his test today, I was so excited. That bad? - Thank you. He diplomatically told me that it was crap. Oh, darling. Do you want to bounce some ideas off me? - That's the thing, there's nothing to bounce. It's like I'm blocked. And I need to get over this soon, because I can literally feel the clients getting cold feet. It would be so bad if we celebrated getting that account for nothing. I was so sure they would love that pitch. Maybe you just need to get it off of your mind for a while. Huh? - I don't have a while. - You'll figure it out, okay? - It worked. Come on, before I have to pee or something. Where are you? Sylvia! - Keep it down. You scared me! I've been looking all over for you. - Really? So, now I'm wondering if you are real, and I'm the one who's dreaming. - Hi. - Well, what do you want? I've got things to do. - Look, Sylvia. I'm sorry. I didn't even know if this, any of this, was gonna work. I just had a feeling. How come you didn't know? - Believe it or not, Richard, I don't know everything. - Yeah, that's hard to believe. - But I am learning some new things. - Really? Like? - Like how you didn't come here because you missed me. So, whatever it is that you want, get to the point. - Okay. I need your help. - You have the nerve, Richard, to come here and ask me for help, after what you did! - I am sorry. I am beyond sorry. - I guess you don't feel insane, right? Talking to a figment of your imagination. - This was a bad idea. I don't even know what I was thinking. - What if I was real? Would you have married me instead? - Perhaps, I don't know. - Change the color of the Zephyr presentation from blue to red, let a woman do the voiceovers, and replace the word grandeur with luxury. - Thank you. - You have to wake up now. - Aren't you going to give me a hibiscus? - Turns out I don't have to. - Yes, Hawa? Mr. Hassan, line one. - Yeah, fine, put him through. Okay. Hello, Mr. Hassan. Richard, this is much better. - Thank you, sir. I owe you a drink. - That won't be necessary, sir. I have to say, this is work very well done. I just want to let you know we're impressed with this new art. We'll be in touch. - Yeah. Red theme, sexy female voice. Highly understated. How's that? - That feels so good. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - How about this? Yeah? Right there. At least if we ever lose our jobs, we could always fall back on my massaging skills. Ow, hey! Don't break it! So, how's work? Anything interesting? - Work's fine. The school has been hiring new teachers lately. One of them is this really cute guy. I think I'm gonna ask him out. - Really? Yeah, okay, just gimme my ring. - No! - Just gimme my ring. - Not happening! - Gimme my ring! - Anyway. And then there's this lady. Her name is Cynthia. - Yeah, well, is she hot? Maybe I can ask Cynthia out? - Ha ha, very funny. And you see the way the boys at school drool over her when she walks by there. It's crazy. - Jealous much? - No joke. - Huh? - No, we're actually along. Oh, past 10. I am going to bed. - Hey, I was watching that! - Now you aren't. Come on. - Because? Let's go! Gonna give me orders. No. We need to call the florist. Hm? - The flowers, they're wilting. - Hey, you think maybe they can send you something other than red hibiscus? - No. - Gbemi, they don't even have a scent. - Mm, you're a florist now, are you? Anyway, if you hate it so much, why was there one under your pillow during the night? - I don't know. Maybe I like the smell. Or the lack of it. - You're weird. - And you love me. I do. - Yeah? You sure? You won't change your mind? I see how you're giving me orders. Share my house about now. - Yo bro, met an insanely attractive woman few weeks ago. - Yeah, you, that changes women the way they change their hairdos. Tell me, what's so special about this one? - I dunno. It's just that I think she's the one, man. You know? - Yeah. - Look, I just think it's time for me to settle down and just be a grown-up, and be more like you, really. Yeah, joker. - Well done. I'm actually being serious. Look, I'm just trying to open up to you, man. I think she just suits me, you know? Actually, it's actually more than that. I think I'm love with her. Dude, you trying to kill me? Did you just use the L word? - Dude, I'm being serious, man. Yo. Pull a muscle or something? Why are you stopping? - What? I added a few kg's. It's taking some getting used to, that's all. - A few kg's, man. Just being lazy. You lazy ass. - Really? Yeah, okay, tough guy. Gimme 10. - Let's see you do 10. - Gimme 10. - Only 10? - Only 10. - You're gonna have to put your money where your mouth is. - Now you know there's money here, come on. In fact, I'll spot you. - I don't need no spot, I got this. Obaro's about to make some cash. - I'll spot you anyway. - I don't need no spot. - Obaro. - I got this. I'll hold your wallet, too. - My wallet? - Well, your wallet. Let's get this. Let's make this money. - You need some help? You don't need no help? - I got. Cool down. - Go for it, all right. Okay, let's go, hey! Lightweight, baby. Flash cake, let's go, baby! Let's go! Four. Five. Six. Seven. - Keep it going. Richard. Richard! - Sorry, I got you. Woo! All right, it's okay, you win. It's all right. Dude, watch we're you're going. - Sorry. No one does so much walking. Woo! What? Hey, you okay? - Yeah. You sure you're okay? - I'm fine. Listen, I've had enough, I think I'm gonna head home. - Well, suit yourself. I'm gonna do some more work here. - Okay, listen, I'm happy for you, yeah? When am I gonna meet her? What's her name? - Hey, I beg, don't jinx this thing for me, eh? Look, I'm in love, and I don't wanna mess this up. No jinxing, please. - It's okay. - Yeah? - Don't use the L word again. Sounds like you just discovered the word. - Look, you know there are a lot of things here that I could hit you with, and I'm tempted to. - Deal, peace. - Just go. - Bring her over sometime. - Just go. - Can you bring her over sometime? - Be going. Jinx master, geez. Hey, you. - Hey. Are you okay? - Yeah, just tired. It was a long day. - Looks like someone hit it pretty hard at the gym, huh? - Oh, you can say that. Obaro says he's found someone that he wants to settle down with. Obaro? - Yep. Obaro. That's interesting - Come on, honeys. Say what you're really thinking. Oh babe, you know that's really like you there. - Yeah, well. Obaro. Right. - He seemed pretty serious. - He should bring her over then. - Yeah, come on. I need some mama love. - Meanwhile, I have more interesting news for you. - Go ahead, spill. Beg me. - Oh, come on, Gbemi, don't let me do the begging thing. - Well. - Spill, tell me. - It looks like we have to start thinking about baby names. - Are you serious? Mm-hmm. - When? Are you serious? You so are! - Hey, Daddy. - Oh, say it again. - Hey, Daddy. - Thank goodness, I'm gonna be a father. - You are. - I'm gonna be a father. You shoulda seen him. It was just on and on and on. - So, you gonna tell me where you're taking me this weekend? - Well. - Tell me! - To the moon. - Yeah? Away to the moon. - One second. Oh, it's my friend Cynthia. She's going to be a bit late. - Oh, really? That's good. - Am I interrupting something? - Hey! - Yes. Finally, man, you made it! - I did! My lady. - My lord. - I think you have your lords mixed up. Yes. - Where's our mystery lady at? - She's running late, something came up last minute. Yeah, she'll be here soon. Hmm, Obaro. - Well. - I can't wait to meet this woman that have managed to tie you down. - No, telling you. - She would be special. - She is. She's very special. I don't remember when last I found someone that make me so happy. - Sir, you sound like a natural dork. - Richard! - It's all right, still proud of you, happy for you. - Thank you. There she is. Huh? - Cynthia's your girlfriend? Hey. Darling, you look stunning. Meet my very good friend, Gbemi. - Well, me and Gbemi are like best friends already. - I see. Just, well, meet my best friend, Richard. - Hi, Richard. I've heard so much about you. Gbemi says wonderful things. - Shake her hand. - Hi, it's nice to meet you, Sylvia. - Babe, it's Cynthia. Cynthia. - Right. - Okay, wait. Breathe. So, Obaro is the boyfriend you've been going on about. Yes, he is. - No, he's not. - What? - I don't understand. - I don't want to be your boyfriend anymore. I mean, the word boyfriend alone just sounds kind of juvenile. I want much more. You're a keeper. You're kind, you're sweet, you're gentle, and you're caring. I mean, you've shown me love as I've never known it before. You're the kind of woman that I've always dreamed of but always presumed could not possibly exist. But here you are, real as ever. And I know this may be coming a bit too soon, but I'll be damned if I let my head talk me out of what my heart already knows. So, I'm asking, Cynthia. - Hey. - Cynthia, will you accept to wake up every morning next to this guy? Would you let me love you, Cynthia? Would you let me be there for you, through thick and thin? Cynthia, will you marry me? She said yes, guys! She said yes! Yes, woo! - Wow, oh my gosh, I'm so glad I got to witness this. You guys are going to have the cutest babies. - I feel like I'm the luckiest girl in the world. Hey, me too. - Indeed! And so are you. - Are you okay, bro? - Yeah. Yeah, memories. Love is a beautiful thing. - I know! Obaro. - Do you really know what you're doing? - I know exactly what I'm doing. Congratulations. This one's on the house. - Awesome! You know what? We're gonna need more of this tonight, okay? - And bring me something stronger, like a whiskey. - No, I'm okay. - Gbemi, you're not gonna drink on a day like this? - Well, I'm this one's designated driver. Also, we're pregnant! - What? Well, congratulations! Really? Well, congratulations, why didn't you tell me? Congratulations! What? - Thank you. - You know what, we need food as well. We need like seafood platters, pizza, we need everything here, to eat, to feast. Oh, baby, do you love me? - Oh, you spoil me. - Good morning, sir. You're late today. I hope all is well at casa del amor. - Good morning, Hawa. - Okay, you're grumpy. - No, I just had a lot of work to do. - Oh yes, you do, have you heard? You have been managing their contract with us, and they're requesting a thing to move their company to a better light. We did it! Yes! Okay. Are you okay, sir? You okay? - Boundaries, Hawa. - Oh, sorry. - Boundaries. - I'll just make your coffee and print your schedule. This is a lot, Gbemi. I know! Hey, you know what? It's Friday. How about you stay the weekend? That would have me no time to go to the store. Please. I sorry, please. This dress is so fine. I know, it's so you. I love this color. But I don't know if those patterns will work. - Yeah? Hold on. Look at this one. Hold on, look at this. This back from here. This is so nice. - Because it's purple. Hey, baby. How was work? - Good. Good, I wish I could've finished those earlier. You okay? - Very. Oh, by the way, babe, I invited Cynthia to stay over. I'm helping with wedding plans. - Sure, I see. - I hope you don't mind, Richard, but your wife has a great sense of aesthetics. I mean, these flowers. Red hibiscuses are my favorite. - My husband hates them all for some reason. - Oh, but I love them. - Thank you. - Did you know that the red hibiscus is the flower of the Hindu goddess Kali? - And she's the goddess of what exactly? - Well, some say sexuality, violence, and motherly love. But she's more known as the destroyer of unreality. - So, she's a destroyer? Isn't that enough reason for us to just get rid of them now? - Oh baby, I did not marry a superstitious man, now did I? Ooh, chicken's done. I will be right back. - I'm just gonna-- - Hi, Richard. - So, I'm staying the weekend. Imagine how much more fun we could have. - Listen to me. - I'm listening. - The last time, it was an accident. It was an accident. - Really, an accident? You're getting clumsy, Richie. - Listen to me. - I'm listening. - It was a mistake. It cannot, it will not happen again, do you understand me, Sylvia? I am trying to build a life with my family. - Oh, honey. How poetic. The only mistake here is your wife, not me. - If my wife comes in right now, what am I gonna? - What's going on here? - Your husband is so clumsy, so he was pretending to show me how he's going to hold the new baby. He failed miserably. - We're not doing work. Come Cynthia, come help me with the food, eh? - Okay. - We need to talk. Sit down. - Okay. - I don't like her. I don't like her. She gives me bad vibes, I do not like her, and I will not have you with her. - All Cynthia has done is be a good friend. I'm sorry, I can't just send her outside simply because she gives you bad vibes. - Who's the man in this house? It's still my house, right? No, last time I checked, it's still my house, right? Did you ask me before inviting her into this place? And then asking her to spend the night. Did you ask me? No, you never listen! You never listen, Gbemi. At first, I asked you to get rid of those bloody hibiscus. Did you? You refuse. Now I'm asking you to get rid of-- - First of all, do not raise your voice at me. Is that good? Why? Why don't you want her here, Richard? Tell me the truth. Wait. Are you attracted to her? Is that it? You're into her? - No! Gbemi, of course not! I love you! I love you, I chose you. I love you. You are my wife, Gbemi. You are my wife, I chose you. Just get rid of her, get rid of her right now. Right now, you don't listen to me, I'm your husband, listen to me. - You need to check your kindness, sweetheart. We are not in the medieval times, you don't get to boss me around. - I'm not bossing you around! I'll try this differently. Can you please get her out of my house? Right now. - Richard, don't patronize me! - You don't understand. - You know I am reasonable person. Just gimme a good reason why she shouldn't be here. - I just don't like her, I don't like her. - I'm going to bed. She will leave tomorrow. - First, a guarantee. My team and I have put together a campaign that will place the UFBN in a position that is indeed rightfully yours. The leading food company here in Nigeria. If you endorse this deal, and of course, let's not forget we're talking specifically in the minds of your target audience. If you endorse this deal, we will be successfully creating an awareness on the lesser known UFBN brands and products, which means, ladies and gentlemen, a rise in sales, and the UFBN will have a more robust and fatter bottom line. - That sounds very good. What we want to know is, how exactly does No Box Incorporated plan on making this happen? Fair enough. Hawa. - Sir? - The folders, if you would. According to our research, we found out that more Nigerians are finding out about processed food. They're a lot more aware and cautious about cautious foods, and being cautious. - Do you mean processed food? Right. Mrs. Iweta again. Processed, right. Hawa? - Yes sir? - Nevermind. Mr. Davies, just worried, did you receive the documents and files that I asked Hawa to email you? - No, she did not send me any documents. - So, you did not receive documents from this Hawa? - No, she didn't send me any folders. - Right. Let me carry on. As I was saying, therefore, to combat these... fearful opinions of potential UFBN consumers, we will-- - It's getting a little difficult to concentrate, isn't it? - We, the site is... We have outlined the, we have outlined everything, and we're thinking rebranding. - Richie, Richie. I will not be ignored. - Gentlemen, I mean, yes. Well, what I was trying to say is, we will take advantage of the public's fear and use that to our advantage, increasing awareness on safety standards that we use for our processed foods. - Yes, come here, Richie, let me kiss that smart mouth of yours. Richard? - Leave me alone! I don't wanna talk to you! You're trying to ruin me! - What's going on? What did you do? - What did I do? What is going on? Richard! - Well, that was awkward. - You. - Miss me? - Sylvia, you win, okay? You win. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I doubted you, I'm so sorry that I said you're not real. I should've listened to you. Please. - It's a little too late for that, sugar. I've set my course, and you, Richie, are going down. - Please. - You betrayed me, Richard. You betrayed us. And all that we had. And then you had the balls to return and ask me to help you, use me over again. Revenge is like an art form, Richard. You are my canvas, and I am like Picasso on steroids. - Please, Sylvia, please! Please! - I think you better get that. It's your booboo calling. I wonder what she's doing today. Ah, yes, that's right. She took a day off work, which means that Sylvia can kick things up a notch. - Sylvia, you wouldn't dare! Sylvia! Gbemi, baby, are you okay? - Of course I am, darling. Why wouldn't I be? - I need you to go somewhere, okay, baby? Anywhere that's crowded. - Richard, what's going on? - Gbemi, just listen to me, okay? I'll see you soon, and I'll explain everything. I'll tell you everything, just go to a movie or somewhere where there are a lot of people, okay, so I know you're safe. - Safe? From what? - Gbemi, please, I can't. - If it makes you feel any better, I'm not alone. Cynthia's here with me. Cynthia, please tell my husband he's being weird. - You're being weird, Richard. Your wife and baby are just fine. Don't you worry. I'll take good care of them, okay? - Sylvia, I swear to you, if you hurt her. - Aw, Gbemi, he says he loves you to pieces. - You see? All's good here. - Gbemi, she's not, I'm coming home right now. - Okay. - Gbemi. I love you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Richard, you hit your PA! You're having a conversation with yourself? What is going on? I recommend you start talking before I turn this matter over to the police. You assaulted a staff! You humiliated this company! - Sir, I don't have time to explain. My wife is in danger, she doesn't know it yet. I really have to go. Hawa? I'm terribly sorry. - You know there will be consequences. - You are not listening to me. She's gonna kill her, okay? - Are you out of your mind? Who's gonna kill who, and why? - I have to go, so sorry. - Richard! - She started kicking already. - Really? Lemme feel. Oh, wow! It's so beautiful. - It's amazing. Babe? Babe? - Gbemi... could you come over here for a second? I just really wanna talk to you. - Are you okay? - Come on baby, this is not one of those times to argue with me. It's not safe. That woman with you, she's not Cynthia. Her name is Sylvia. And she's the most powerful being. Gbemi, please just listen to me, please. - No, this isn't making any sense. - I know, just trust me. - Babe, I'm starting to really worry-- Gbemi! Gbemi? - Calm down. Don't try to get up. Sit back, relax. You won't want to fall on your face, now, do you? What did you do? - I did something with tea. I laced her tea with something extra special. - You drugged my wife? - Relax, Richard. At least it's not lethal, like the herbs you gave your mother. - You told me those herbs will heal her. - I lied. Surprise! - What did she ever do to you? - Think, Richard. She was just another woman who had too much influence on you, and I don't like to share. - Gbemi. Gbemi. - Richard. - I'm so sorry, baby. - Quiet! Mommy and Daddy are having a conversation, okay? So don't interrupt. So, I'm real, I exist, and I think I've proven that clearly, so how about we just get together forever? Hm? Richard, I'm not going to say it again. Be with me, now or never. This has got to stop, Sylvia. - You're trying to kill me? With a knife? - It's worth a shot. - Oops! - Gbemi! Gbemi, no! - Stupid, stupid. Richard Okezie, advertising superstar, kills his lovely wife. For shame, Richard. For shame! Right on cue. I told you he'd gone crazy, I told you! - Obaro. I didn't do this to her. - Yes you did, I saw you! - Shut up! Obaro, you know me. Obaro, you know how much I love my wife. Obaro, you know I wouldn't do this. - Richard? What happened? - It was she! She was standing in front of my wife, and I was trying to kill her! One second, poof, she was gone! And then, I didn't mean to kill my Gbemi! I was trying to kill Sylvia! - Who the hell is Sylvia? - That is Sylvia. That's Sylvia behind you. The same witch you're getting married to. Obaro, I've been seeing her in my dreams my whole life. - Dreams? - I'm telling you, all this time. And then you know what? She got jealous when I met my Gbemi. She got jealous when I met my Gbemi, so she's ruined me! - Richard, you're not making sense right now. Oh, she's trying to ruin me! - Richard, you're not making sense! Richard, just put the knife down, okay? Just put the knife down. I told you, now Gbemi's dead. I can't believe she's dead. - You bloody witch, you killed her! - Just put the knife down. Just put the knife down, and we'll talk. We gotta talk! - Obaro. - Richard, listen to me! Hey, Richard, just calm down! Get the knife! Get us some rope. Cynthia, get us some rope, tie him down. Cynthia? - My name is Sylvia. - What did you do? What did you do? - No, Richard. What did you do? Man kills his wife and best friend because he thinks they're having an affair. That's what the press will say. And the way I see it, you'll end up in jail or an asylum. Or you can come with me, Richard, and we can start afresh. The choice is yours. - You don't believe me. I don't blame you for being skeptical. I've often wondered-- - I actually believe you. - What? Really? - Yeah. I was going to give you this. I ran into a lady in there today, and she'd claimed she knew you. She told me to give you the flower. I asked for her name, and she said it wasn't necessary. You said she was gonna give you a second chance? - Second chance would still fail. I'd rather burn in Hell.
