Come in. Hey. Good morning. I'm Mr. Robertson. Mr. Robertson, have a seat. It's good to have you. So what brings you in today? Uh, the free session I saw on the advertisement. Yeah, I lost my job a few months ago. And I been kind of having a hard time you know. I'm stressed, been to a thousand interviews. Can't sleep, because I keep thinking about it. And you know my baby momma keeps asking me for money. And it's just hard right now. You know my girl said she went to some therapy sessions a while ago and it helped her. So I'm just here to just. Try to find some help. So sounds like that you have some good influences on what therapy could be like. But you don't have any personal experiences yourself. Okay. What are you expecting to get out of therapy? I don't know. Just maybe some peace of mind. To where I can sleep. Yeah. Okay. So, moving forward, it would be really important for both of us but particularly you to understand, that our job positions and stress and sometimes even relationships. Those things can be temporary. And it's natural to want to keep those things or even experience loss, stress, not being able to sleep. When those things are threatened. Or seem like they're gonna move away. But our happiness and that peace of mind that you were talking about, those things aren't tied to temporary things. And your worth and your sense of being enough those things are eternal, as you are. So if we could keep that orientation in mind as we move forward, that can be the foundation for us to do work while we're in therapy. What do you think about that? Hello? Yeah, this is Mr. Robertson. 7:45? Yeah, I can be there by 7:45. Okay, thank you. Can I help you? Yes, I'm here to substitute for Miss Miller's room? Sign in. Do you know where her class is? No ma'am. Go out the hall to room 109. Go downstairs, catch the elevator if you want to. Have a good day. Good morning class. Good morning Mr. Robertson. Hello? Hello? Marvin? I just got to work. What do you want? I just want you to know that we're going to have to go to court. So you can pay child support for your son. Look, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We need to handle this. It doesn't have to be like this. You made it like this. Man, don't talk about... Bye. Hello? Marvin? Hello? Hey baby. How you doing? Yeah, I'm doing good. How about you? I'm a little stressed out, concerned, worried. Nah baby, we fine honey. Look are you sure you're okay me coming to work? Get that corn. We good. Do what you gotta do. Okay. Well, listen. Let me ask you something. Let me ask you something real quick. How you feel about you coming and staying with me for a few days? I would love that. Okay. Well look, I'm a call you on my lunch break or something okay? Okay, talk to you later. All right bye. All right, baby, love you. Sir we got that other machine all cleaned up. And, anything else we can do for you? No, that's all I need today. By the way. Do you have any more of that poetry you were working on? I have a few pieces that I've been collecting. Why you ask? I was talking to a publishing friend of mine, and we were thinking about maybe turning it into a book. What, really? Yeah. What do I need to do? You need to get it all together. Put it into a file. And get to me as quick as possible so we can read it. Absolutely, absolutely, thank you, thank you, thank you. My head has been a lot clearer lately. You know with me going to like therapy man. It really is something that I think everybody probably kind of needs to look into. Just a bit. Just because it's, man it's helpful to work through some stuff. Man, have you ever thought about going on and seeing a therapist or something like that? A councilor or something like that? Come in. Mr. Robertson. Hey, how are you? Hey, sir, good to see you. Welcome back. Good to see you too. Absolutely, have a seat. Whoops, thank you. Okay, it's good to see you. You too, you too. I thought that the last session went really well, so I decided to sign up for another one. All right. Yeah, it helped me a little bit. And I appreciate that. Okay, so before I ask about what's been going on, what about the last session did you like? Did you... Well, it just allowed me to be able to just talk my way through some things. And be more solution-orientated and not think about stuff so much. Like, oh I gotta get this done, I gotta get this done. And living in the moment a little bit. Yeah, and I also wanted to tell you that the pre and post test that we took to look at your stress levels? They were really really high when we first started the session, and your last one after the session that we did? It was significantly lower. Good. So it's good that I'm hearing this data from you. That you felt like you got something out of it because your scores showed that you felt less stressed. Yeah, they told me that my ACES score was really high? From childhood trauma or something like that. But I don't know. Yeah, that's the Adversive Childhood Experiences Survey. They came out of Harvard, and actually they're trying to put it into school systems to make sure that we're being able to identify our kids who need more support. And as well as with adults, identify and be aware so we can address it, so yeah. So tell me, what's been going on? Well, you know just kind of. You know, working through those things. I got a position where I'm subbing more frequently, so that's let me not have as much stress and bringing in some income. So that's good. But you know I had a situation where one of my brother's car got shot up. And you know I'm just trying to not do something that's gonna jeopardize my future. Mm hm. And it's just hard to navigate those situations. And do the right thing sometimes. So I'm just trying to think my way through it instead of just being irrational. What's up bro? Man, I see you still rocking them cowboy? Yo, baby we gonna always be cowboys man. Paying child support, I had to give extra on top of what I giving you already. They already asking for extra? Man, come on man. Hey I got bills myself. I gotta live! Right. But at the same time man, I want to be able to any and everything for them but you know man, I've been going through it bro. I just need a little prayer man, because I man trying to survive out here on these streets, and these streets out here ain't calling me. I'm trying to go home and be with the family and take care of mine, but. Yeah, you know. Everybody needs some prayer sometimes man. You know what, man I'll pray for you right now. Man, please bro. Thank you. Take my hand and pray with me. For sure. Dear heavenly father, we pray that you keep your hand on this young man. Yes sir. And let him be successful in what he's doing. Help him to build and keep having to break relationships with his children, make sure that his finances are where they need to be. And you keep your hands on him, all of his stuff like we know that you said that you would. And let him allow you to lead his life in the right direction and make good decisions that are gonna last a lifetime and have generational value and break generational curses, and keep things all together in love and glorify your name and it'll all be for you. In the name of Jesus amen. Amen, man. Amen. Yeah, that's what it's about right there man. Man, I appreciate that man, I felt that man. 'Cause look, prayer changes things. That's the only thing I know that works. In my whole life, for real. Prayer. And talking I really kind of believe in, that it's bigger than me. Because man, I done went through so much in my life now I see because I'm helping other kids. I wouldn't even know. I would be like one of these people come from Montana, or Wyoming, that ain't ever lived in the city. That don't know about you know helping somebody else. Because they ain't ever been in it. Right. And God just put me in that position man, and that just really made me a better person. To where it ain't about me no more. It's about the bigger picture, what I can give back. Because I be thinking, I'm a die all the time, I'd have been shot at, ganged, all the crazy stuff that happen and it's like, am I supposed to be here? You know? And then when God give you different opportunities to let you cash in on why he even got you here. That right there man. It really been helpful for me in my life. Man, I'm a keep praying for you man. Man, really man. You gotta come over to the house man, for sure. Man, I'm a have to come over there. I got a small chess board, it ain't super nice. We gonna get us a big old chess board. I need a minute. You don't have to worry about it. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah. We put a couple of them in the alley, you know how it look good all the time. And say a few more prayers for a man because I'm about to make it out here. Ain't gonna let this situation stop me, because there ain't nothing out here gonna be able to stop me. Only person that can stop you is yourself. I don't believe in that, yeah because the system trying to, and they trying to do it in the system and stuff. You know all it ain't gonna stop me. Hey what it do Charles, what's up with you baby? How about them Cowboys? Oh my god. Man, but yeah man. When it's all over said and done man. I'm a step foot out here and I'm gonna make it. You ain't got no choice but to. You got people riding on you. Waiting on you. Right, you got you just trying to get the food. I hate to see the backside of you. Is walking away from me what you really wanna do? You're a sight for sore eyes and I love any of you. But I know it's not polite if I keep staring at you. So hello lady, hi can I please stand by your side? And I'm sorry if I disrespected, my approach can be corrected. Seeing the back of you had me affected but don't walk away from, my mind would be hectic. To know that our heart's time will be neglected. So I'm daydreaming of us being spiritually connected, so here pouring out my soul is how I left it. Okay. My goodness. That's awesome. I was not prepared. I didn't know you had that in you, like what? What? You a little poet hon. There's a whole lot more I'm trying to show you. Little poet, who knew? But look. There's something I need to tell you though. Tell me what? What's up? I don't know how to say it. Just say what's on your mind babe, what's up? I really care about you. I'm here with you in this relationship. We about to have a baby. And I feel like I need to be 100% with you. As you should. What's up? Just talk. Can't be that serious, like. What's up? My ex came by my house. Mm hm? And she told me she was pregnant Okay, that has nothing to do with you. What that gotta do with you? She's saying it's mine. What? No, Marvin. No. Are you kidding me? So you been still messing with her? - No. - Are you serious? I ain't even. Does she know about me? Does she know we got a baby? Does she know you got this to take care of? Like, how could you do this? Like are you serious, no! So you gonna mess with her. I wasn't messing with her. Really, you gonna get her pregnant? It was like seven months ago. So you gonna leave me for her. No, I'm not leaving you for her. Well then why you still messing with her? You're not listening to what I'm saying about how I feel about you? Well you ain't said nothing to me. And it's not about your words, it's about your actions. My actions, baby look. I done got you a ring and everything. I'm serious about us. Yo, I want us to be together. I don't want it like this. Not like this. We gonna make it work. We gonna make it work. We gonna make it work. Not like this. Yo, I'm gonna be here for you and the baby. That's why I love you. I'm sorry. You know so I'm learning, like I look at this theory of the sponge. To where I take in everything everybody does around me, all the people I care about. All the people that influence me. And things that I can benefit from, I keep in. But I squeeze out all the things that I feel like are not beneficial to me, and not gonna help me. And you know, I cast those away. That way I can keep the good and expel the bad. Because it's not necessarily what you put out but what you got in. So that's my theory. That's amazing. I'm gonna give you a great quote, that you know how we got different people got different quotes. I'm gonna give you an Uncle D quote. That I over the years, I use. I came upon it when I was in college 'cause. What I did in college, is I was, a big fish in a little pond I went to a small college. I was successful, and I went and had a big hit. Never allow a reaction to an attraction create a distraction. Maintain your focus. Say that again, say that again. You're on point right now, doing some great things, God is blessing you and has blessed you. Never allow a reaction to an attraction create a distraction. So in other words, something over here, for me it was girls. In college... For me it's girls too! Reacting to those, seeing an attraction and reacting to it takes me away from my focus of what I was doing. I need to maintain my focus, do my work. What I'm supposed to do at school. And study and do all those things. So that attraction can take you away from what your commitment to do. So stay committed to what you do. Maintain your focus. And then... Man it wasn't over. Man, I'm a put on my shades dude. Man you don't need to put on them shades. Man, see what I just did. You gonna need to put on some shades bro, like. Because you gonna be in the dark after I knock you out. But let's it though Keenan, what you gonna do? What you gonna do? I'm about to show you what I'm about to do. Oh, yeah. Let me tell you this man. I got a call from Mr. Howe. You know he does performances and stuff. And they got this performance coming up. You know the mayor gonna be there and some other acts and stuff and they asked us to perform and I was like yeah! So you down? You gonna get up there with me? We can do like a duality flow thing or something? It'd be dope. Man, we done talked about it before. Right. But we gonna need to practice. Duh! Because we know you ain't got your word number one. All right. That's real good news. Right, I'm trying to tell you. Time I get win right there. What win? Win you imagining. Everybody wanna get Keenan, I'm getting Charlie every time putting on feed. Spinning bird kick! You got one move. Oh you want me use some other move? Hold on now, hold on now. There some other moves. So what you wanna do after the show? This dude is beating me! Let me take off, it's the shades man. Yeah, it is. I can't see good. Thank you coach Key so much for helping me out. I appreciate you doing this stuff. If you could just please put it in the bathroom. Hello? Hey, is this Mr. Robertson? Yes, this is Mr. Robertson. Hey, this is Miss Miller from school. How you doing? Oh hey Miss Miller. Well, I was just calling you because I'm getting ready to go on maternity leave in a couple of weeks and I had spoke to the principle here at school and I was trying to get you a permanent substitution position job until the end of the school year, how do you feel about doing that? Really? Oh wow. That is awesome. Thank you so much. Yes. Absolutely. I appreciate you. And we're going to switch up, so that the next group can come paint. Hello? Oh hey Miss Miller. You know Mr. Robertson, the kids love you. And you always do a good job. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna leave the lesson plans laid out for the next five weeks, and I think we're gonna have a position for you next school year. I'll talk to the principal. Several teachers are leaving, so if you do a good job, the position could be yours. So just make sure that you're on your P's and Q's. Yes, absolutely. I will be on my P's and Q's everyday. Yes. Tell them yes. Thank you for the opportunity. No problem, thank you so much. And I will see you soon. Lord, thank you. Thank you thank you thank you. I know two times I tried to lead to my own understanding. Lord, you're always on time. Thank you so much. I really appreciate the opportunity. I won't let you down. Thank you lord. Amen. Bro, I heard you talking about my momma. You don't be doing that bro. What you gonna do about it? I'm gonna fight you. Come on, square up. Mr. Robertson? This Mr. Robertson. There's about to be a fight on the first floor. Okay, I'm on my way. You don't want none of this small fry. Hey hey hey, man what is y'all doing? Y'all too big for this. What's going on? He was talking about my momma and I don't like it. It gets me like mad talking about my momma. You know his momma? Does he know your momma? No. So every time somebody say something about you you don't like, y'all gonna fight? No. See 'cause when I was y'all age, man, I ended up having to go to juvenile. Get put in handcuffs. Went to alternative school for a year. That's not what I want for y'all. Y'all know what's happening to kids like y'all in the streets right now? They're dying? What's happening? They're dying like he said. They keep getting shot at 'cause they wanna start stuff like this. And that's what you wanna do? No. That's what you wanna do? So look, I see your grades and your test scores. I see your grades and your test scores. Y'all are too smart for this mess. Too smart. You gonna learn, you gonna have to learn how to control your emotions, you have to learn how to control your anger. Because if you don't, you're gonna be a statistic. And that's not what I want for you. Y'all are both black men. Y'all gonna grow up and be black men anyway. Right now y'all acting like little boys. Y'all gotta do better than this. Yes sir. Do you understand me? Yes sir. Do you understand me? Yes sir. Now this can't happen no more. Do I need to go ahead and just suspend y'all? Put y'all out of school so you can learn a lesson? - No. - No sir. Do we need to call your momma? No sir. Do we need to call your momma? Are you sure? Yes. Because this mess need to be over with. Is it over with? Shake hands. Now I don't want to see this mess no more. Go your separate ways. Acting crazy. Man what's up my people. What's up with you? Oh man, long time no see man! What's up cos? What's up bro? You know I love you man. Come on get your hug. Yeah! Who you got here? Yeah? Dayton and Dulsa? Dayton, Dulsa y'all look like some twins. Like some twins! They are! They are twins! Those my twins! Brother got twins! Brother got twins! Twins, twins twins! Lord, this is a message to you. I don't know what else to do. And I speak for my crew, 'cause this is what we all going through. Our pain runs deep. How deep? So deep I can't even sleep. Tossing and turning, chest burning. Why's this all we're earning. Nine to five, minimum wage, man is this why I'm working? I'm living check by check, stressed, but blessed to be living. I'm still willing to strive, prospect these means to beings. But that lifestyle involves some dirty dealing that's not appealing. A storm cloud's covering my mental vision. It still burns. The world still turns. As we get closer to the end of our worldly life terms. And these are the days of our lives. As the world turns. These are the days of our lives as the world turns. I sit still and my mind travels a million miles a minute. I'm thinking about the world and how we fit in it. We're just really mere molecules and we need earthly things to survive. To survive. And I strive to appreciate all life which helps me stay alive. If there was no food chain, you couldn't eat. So you can't say that you stand on your own feet. If there was no gravity we'd all be floating and go away. So let's make this world better and not just try to maintain. And these things could drive a thoughtful person to pain. And doctors could give you drugs and diagnose of this loose in your brain. When you hunger for good I bet you find pain. And then you find others who like you feel the same. And these are just the small pieces of emotions that run through my brain. To give us a space to try things and do things and discover who is that they need to be, and who needs to be out. They give us a machine that can fail in those spaces but the family gives us that space. And they fail to describe a fraction of the hope sometimes it's what's necessary. Sometimes we it's odd, but we feel we need to do. Hey Miss Corlowe, tell Mr. Robertson that I'm ready for him. How you doing doc? Nice to see you. Absolutely. Have a seat for me, have a seat. Yes sir. So, I've been watching you work obviously over the last couple of months. Our boys and girls love you. Every time I sit down and have a conversation with a parent they consistently tell me that you're making connections with the boys and girls. And you're pushing them to new heights. As you know we have a teacher that's retiring at the end of the school year. And I would like to just formally offer you a position to join our team. Wow. Thank you. Absolutely, yes sir. I'm, yes. What do I need to do? So there's a couple of steps I can take. Obviously we gonna make the offer at the school level. Our HR department will reach out to you. They'll make the official offer and talk salary, compensation. And then you'll accept the job with them. But I'm excited to have you as part of the team. I know you gonna change lives here. Thank you, look thank you. Man I appreciate y'all getting me. I've been praying for a job. This is a blessing, I really appreciate you. Well, my pleasure. We're looking forward to seeing how you change lives here. Yes sir, thank you. All right. Oh man, what's up with you bro? What's going on? I'm chilling man, I'm chilling you know. Woo. So what's been up with you? What you got going on? What you reading over there, the Bible? Yeah, reading the Bible. Trying to find some inspiration for my poetry book. Okay, okay. Where you at in there? Genesis 22. Oh okay, oh you already got this one marked off on me you must knew. All right. Yeah. Oh man guess what, I got some good news though bro. What happened, what's going on with you? Man, today you know I been subbing at my job and stuff. Yeah, I see you looking all clean. Right, right, right right right. Principal called me into the office, I'm thinking like man I'm probably in trouble or something man because you know I'm in there going hamburgers, you know telling kids to stop, get your life together. But you off in the projects though. Right, deep off in the hood. But you know I can relate to those kind of kids. And that's what he said. He was like look, Mr. Robertson you been doing a good job and parents giving me good compliments about you. We got a teacher retiring, we want you to come work full time for us. Yeah, he offered me the job today man! I was like, woo! Hallelujah! God bless you, be like yes sir, yes sir! Right right man. Man, God bless you. What you gonna do with all that product you got? Oh, you talking about that? I mean. Okay, so this is what I'm thinking. I talked to little man TI. And they told me just give him the bread for what I got rid of, but for the rest of the stuff you know, I can take back. And they said they'd take it back. You know, they don't normally do that. There ain't no refunds in the hood. Hey, but he didn't really want you to take it no ways. Right right. That's real love right there. Right, I didn't really wanna go that way anyway. Kind of like, kind of like every hymn in this psalm. Like the ram and the bush. You know God gave me an outlet to where I didn't have to do, you know, 'cause I didn't really want to do that. Right. That's a lot of risk. You was gonna sacrifice your freedom. Freedom. Right. In my life and everything else. Right. To get money. Right, trying to survive. Right. But you know Bob Marley said, Bob Marley said numbers are endless. So if you're searching for numbers for your happiness, you ain't never gonna be happy. So you know it just kind of made me think about that. Well let me think about that for a second. Yeah man. Man, wow. Yeah man. Right. Because you can always just add some zeros infinitely. Right. Infinitely. Right so I'm just glad God did what he did for me. Like divinity. That was a super big blessing man, for real. Man, everything seems to be turning around man. Right. You put God first, and put trust up in him, it seems like no, I know for a fact. I can testify. You have blessings in your life. Absolutely. You have trials and tribulations, yes, but you have blessings in your life. Right. You know my book's about to get published. You just got promoted. Oh yeah, they did that? That dude at your work? Man! Congratulations man! You know what's what I'm saying, get the inspiration go ahead and finish that that project! The concert we're practicing for. Right, right, right. And then, I think we need to go celebrate. Hey, matter of fact. My boss said he was gonna take us four-wheeling man, he said hey we gonna take a four-wheeling trip, do you wanna go? Are you asking me to go? Yeah, I'm asking you to go. Yeah, I'll go! Yeah! There's nothing wrong for that mountain! For sure, yeah absolutely. That sounds fun. You know I need to celebrate anyway. God's just been blessing me lately. And well, he been blessing my whole life, but really lately he been coming through for me man. Yeah, you was in a dark place. That I ain't know, we both for it man. You know, just, you come to a crossroads and if you lean towards God, you gonna make the right path. Right. And I mean, I'm just glad I got you as a brother man. Somebody go through that with. Absolutely man, me too. Me too. Make sure you stay in your place, little brother. That's what God got. You know we ain't nothing without God man. That's the realest thing ever man, I love that. You gonna accept. Your inself is your energy. Like I put on every post about Nispey. Energy never dies. Your energy is here. You know what I'm saying, and then the thing, Nispey modeled himself after Pot. He said thug life. He screamed pot. All that. And look what he did. He's just not common. Bless you. Oh! Get something for everybody, get some chicken man. Hey, home boy need that. What up with y'all? What's up bro? Bro. Man.
