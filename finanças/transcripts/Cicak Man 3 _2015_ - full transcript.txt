Oh god! I need to pee. - Please carry these things first? - Go ahead, then. Hey. It's tiring to work like this. So, you think it's not tiring for me? Flirting with those soldiers earlier. You yourself said that you wanted to be me like me. You want to be pretty and have plastic surgery. You want to spend men's money. Just follow what we do. I have not peed like a man for ages. Do you remember that soldier? The one who tried to flirt with me? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Hey? Ants! Ouch! Ouch! That hurts. This is going to damage my body. You've stolen Metrofulus government property. Hey! Little sisters. That tickles. Oh, no. Where are you running to? Good day, Metrofulus. What is that? This is a warning. Drop your weapon. What is this? Three. Two. One. What happened to you? Why are you wet? There goes my perfect body. Oh, my! What was that? I don't know. Let's go. Carry her. - Heavy. - Hurry. Fake women! RED ANTS GANG - Take that! - Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Why won't it start? So troublesome! - Are you a member of the Red Ants Gang? - Who are you? - The new superhero of Metrofulus. - Let go! Who designed your suit? It's amazing! It's not the suit that's amazing. It's my body that's fit. You're going to break my Adam's apple! Listen up! I'll let you live. Tell your leader the Red Ants Gang is about to die. Respect, bro! WHERE IS CICAKMAN? HAS CICAKMAN RETIRED? POLICE HUNT MAN WHO ATTEMPTED TO STEAL MONEY FROM ATM HAS ANYONE SEEN CICAKMAN? MAYBE CICAKMAN IS DEAD? WE NEED A NEW SUPERHERO METROFULUS COURTS - Linda. - I'm tired of talking to you. Linda please stop for a second. I have something to discuss with you. Could you give me a chance to talk to you? We've talked so many times, but you never change! Please withdraw your decision to break up with me, Linda. Please don't make this situation any harder than it already is. Next week, we'll meet again for the court hearing. Dad, don't forget it's my birthday tomorrow. COURT Sir! This can be settled, Linda. Please don't make it a big mess. Sir. Can you comment about the prototype weapons heist from the Metrofulus Army involving the Red Ants Gang? Apologies, I'm not able to comment. Sir, how about the prototype weapons missing from the scene? Sorry, I am truly unable to comment as the investigation is still underway. There are CCTV recordings alleging that the robbers have been defeated by Metrofulus' superhero. Can you comment on this? Do you not understand Malaysian? What matters is that the police is always here to maintain peace in Metrofulus. - Thank you. - Undoubtedly, we have the police. However, since Cicakman vanished, the crime index rate in our country has been rising every year. So might there be a new superhero after this? What are your thoughts? I'm Fiza from Papaya magazine. Commissioner Kahar, when are you getting married? Been single for a while. Why did you ask a ridiculous question? You should work for the entertainment desk instead - How dumb. - Ridiculous. Any other questions? What about the safety of our nation? If there are no further questions, thank you. Respect! Isn't that Linda E? Who is Linda E? The once famous singer! Hey look, Linda E! - Linda! - Can I take your photo? - Linda. - What were you doing in court? Is everything okay? Linda, what were you doing in court? Are you suing someone or you being sued? Excuse me, one moment. Linda. Linda. Adam? Yes, I'm Adam. Remember me? What are you doing here? I'm actually trying to go home. It's all right, I'll give you a ride. Come. Excuse me. Linda! Linda! Stop calling out to Linda. Get on, quick. That's my wife! I don't care. Get on, quick! I'm going to meet circuit girls after this. Linda. Let's go! This must be your son with Man, right? Yes, his name is Boboi. Hello, Boboi. Mom told me not to speak to strangers. This is my old neighbor, Boboi. His name is Adam. Is Rozi well? Rozi passed away two years ago. - She had an accident. - I'm sorry to hear that. It's all right. What were you doing at the courthouse? What's with your face? Did you soil your underpants? Look at this! See what I found. This is from the Cicakman memorial. Where did you get this? Yes! Hey! Are you nuts? I still care for Linda. Hey! If she's done with you, you should just leave her. Ever since I've stayed at your place, I could feel that she's not compatible with us, we can't bond. We can go naked, she can't. Linda, please forgive me for asking. Yes? Are you having problems with Man? I'm separating from Man. Man is a good man, actually. But sometimes we must look for someone responsible to look after the family. Mom, is he trying to seduce you? Linda is not like she used to be. It's so hard to please her. It used to be so easy. I don't get Linda anymore. Why is it so hard to please her? Am I not funny anymore? There has to be something she's not happy about with you. Maybe you haven't been attending to her needs? - Bed... - Bed? You want to say it's because of problems in bed? - Hey! - Stop! Stop! If you want to die, don't drag me with you. You're crazy. Hey! Don't you realize? Linda is leaving me because of you! She doesn't like you! What did you promise me? At first, you wanted to stay at my place for two weeks. Today, it's been six months! What are you on about? There's no such thing as her not liking me. She told me herself that she likes me. She thinks of me as her own child. Since you've been staying here, Jojo, I feel as though you're my own child. I provide for everything. She's even willing to provide for me! She even wanted to breastfeed... Hey! Even I have never drank her milk. Don't you dare, or I'll punch your face. I don't even drink milk! Let's just go home. No! What's with you? Let's go home. I said no! Do you understand? You can just go ahead. Suit yourself. I'm leaving. ♪ Look at me, I am your lover ♪ ♪ Even I am not perfect ♪ ♪ Try to understand even a little bit ♪ ♪ The typical old love ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ Have hurt my pride ♪ ♪ You're haunting me in every step I take ♪ ♪ Look at me ♪ Do not loiter in this area, to avoid arrest.

Pak Long wants me to settle this before the diamond jubilee of Metrofulus. The elections are approaching. That's of utmost importance now. To uphold his image as the mayor, that's been affected since the Grasshopper Gang spread their influence in Metrofulus. Don't forget the Red Ants Gang, Kahar. I know. Cicakman is no longer around. Metrofulus needs a new superhero. PASIR BERDENGUNG STATION - Hey, Man! - Hey, Bedah. Where's Linda? You're usually with her. Oh, Linda. She went back to her mother's house. That's why she's not here. No wonder it's been a while since I've seen her. Hey! This cutie is here again. This is what we want. Hey! - What's with that noise? - Dog, right? Doctor! No? Hey, it's my problem whether I want to be a doctor or not. Hey, it's not like that. Usually, doctors aren't shy or ashamed. It hurts. Can you massage me a little? I don't entertain cheap bikers like you. You stink, yet you have the cheek to ask me to give a massage. Hey, are you blind? Can't you see how big our bikes are? We've upgraded ourselves to become gangsters. - Gangsters! - Grasshopper! Hey! Can you all stop harassing her? Did he really have to interrupt us? - Let go of me! - Stop harassing her, huh?

Congratulations, for you are to become a superhero as I had been. I purposely left this chest at Cicakman's memorial, as I feel that only my truest admirer deserve to continue the legacy of Cicakman. Actually, the conditions to become Cicakman is easy. You'll find everything you need to become Cicakman in this chest." "You must not tell anyone that you are Cicakman. Even though I have retired, the evil in Metrofulus will not stop". A new phenomenon from Metrofulus, the appearance of a new superhero who calls himself SuperBro. For the full scoop, we join Metrofulus TV reporter... Man! METROFULUS PLAZA SuperBro! SuperBro! Take them. Yes. Thank you, please take photos. Behind me, you can see the new superhero of Metrofulus, who is said to have successfully captured... - Ouch, this suit is really tight. - With this arrest... The old Cicakman was really skinny! ...in the near future. To all the reporters who wish to ask questions, you may do so now, I am ready to answer. Why are you helping Metrofulus, when Cicakman has already retired? What is that? I'm helping Metrofulus. Because I... - He looks like a wimp. - So, what? At least SuperBro is more muscular than Cicakman. Hey! Oh, God. What's with you? What mascot is this? Are you joining a circus show? Tomorrow is Boboi's birthday, I have to be there. It is a costume party. So this is the costume for that party. Mom! Look at this, Mom! SuperBro, the new superhero is so cool, Mom. I'm not doing all this for fame. I am doing it out of a sense of responsibility. Respect Bro! Don't forget, that's my slogan. Another clown who wants to save the world. And I... If this is the kind of man who marries your beautiful wife, I think she'll be happy. Not someone like you. See? Even the lizards agree. What did it say? Can you understand it? If it makes that sound, then it's right. Geckos are different. They sound like this. You and your nonsense. So, have you got a new job yet? Not yet. My workplace has an opening. All right, I'm going upstairs. I want to call Boboi. Hello, Boboi. Hello, dad. Hi, Boboi! Can you guess what I found today? Did you watch TV earlier? Yes. Why, Boboi? SuperBro, the new superhero of Metrofulus. - He's cool! - Boboi, come and eat! Yes, I know how you love superheroes. Where's your mom, Boboi? Are you coming tomorrow? Tomorrow? Boboi? We'll talk later. Mom asked me to eat. As always. You know how she is. Yes I know how she is. Okay, okay. - Bye, Boboi. - Respect, Bro! Respect, Boboi. Just let him eat first, okay? Hello, Linda? Adam here. I'm sorry, Adam. How did you get my number? Even the government's secrets are in my hands, what more your phone number. What's the matter, Adam? Nothing, really. Just wanted to see how you're doing. Good. Adam, Boboi and I are about to eat. We'll speak another time, all right? Sure thing. Okay, bye. Hi, handsome. Where are you off to? HAMPAS ROAD This is the work of genius. You tipped the Red Ants Gang... to steal weapons from the army. Then, we steal from them. This is a brilliant idea. This is good stuff. Army prototype weaponry truly is the best. After this, the police and army of Metrofulus won't stand a chance. Help! Stop bothering me! Help! Please, stop bothering me! Let me go! Even though I've retired, evil in Metrofulus will never stop. No, that is mine! Hey! What? Do you think we don't have names? Hey! If you want to be a superhero, or anything else, that's your problem! Can't you respect us a little? - Hey, we are the Grasshopper Gang... - Hey! You think I care? Whether you're grasshoppers, batter fried grasshoppers... or grasshoppers in red sauce... I'm a lizard. Lizards eat insects, you know? Lizard? The Cicakman era ended long ago! Please... go home now. Thank you, Man. Take that! You just ate dirt. And you claim to be Cicakman? What are you waiting for? Get him! Actually, I am the new Cicakman. Man, please have some common sense. Even just a little. If you did, you would've remembered that tomorrow is Boboi's birthday party. If Boboi and Linda asked how you got all these bruises, what will you tell them, Man? I'm eradicating evil in Metrofulus, Jo. Ouch, Jo! Hey! What are you laughing at? Did I say something funny? I told you, don't come as Cicakman. - Hey, what's wrong with it? - It looks obscene. Take this. You're just embarrassing me. Embarrassed? They like me. How about you? Not embarrassed with that? Black briefs? That's out of place. You want to fight with me? Why does it feel weird? Oh, it's inside out. Hey, mom. - Cicakman. - It's so hard to put this on. It's me, Man. Don't you recognize me? - Where are the eye holes? - You're wearing makeup, Man? This make up is to make my face look smooth, for special effect. You look like a crossdresser. What's with him? Acting all weird and dressed like this? This is not weird. This is wrestling. You've never seen wrestling? Why are you dressed like a lost cowboy? Where's the horse? I'm not a cowboy. I'm the Lone Ranger. My house. My rules. Yes? I can be your horse. Come ride me. - All sorts of weirdness. - Dad! Hey! Boboi. Happy birthday. Handshake. - For you. - Wow! Open it! I bought this for you. Ha! Hyah, hyah, hyah! A Cicakman school bag. Here you go! A Cicakman school bag? Why aren't you smiling? Why sulk? Why? It would be nice if it was a SuperBro school bag. Cicakman is the best, he's the most powerful. No! SuperBro is better! Now, all of my friends are using SuperBro school bags. - It comes with a bottle and pencil case. - Pencil case? I'll get you one. Hey, Linda! Hyah! Boboi, call your friends. We're going to blow candles on the cake. - Come on. - What's with your face? This white thing? I'm actually wearing make up for special effect-- Boboi, call your friends. Okay? - Come, everyone, birthday cake time. - Call everyone. What's wrong? It's his birthday. What's the matter with you? - What's the matter? - You think that I don't know that you fought with gangsters near our house? How do you know all this? You! You said... What example are you setting for Boboi? What if something happened to you? You do care about me after all. No. I'm thinking about Boboi. I don't want him to become an orphan, because his father is daydreaming to become a superhero. Linda... now that you've mentioned superhero... I have a secret to tell you, Linda. But please don't tell anyone. What? Don't tell anyone. Actually... I am... Cicakman. If you don't want to change, I feel it's better if you don't bother me and Boboi anymore. Linda, I've changed from a normal guy into Cicakman. This is a change, a shift. Linda. Okay. Okay. Actually, I've got a job. I have my own career now. Jojo recommended me at his workplace. Now, I... work as a... window cleaner. But at the same time... I am part-time Cicakman. Linda! I bought a present for you. Have a look. Wow, a mobile phone! That's expensive, Adam. It's not often. Only once a year. Actually, I have something to discuss with you. Linda has been trying to find work everywhere, but to no avail. She has no experience, so it is not easy to find a suitable job. Very well, ma'am. I'll keep an eye out for a job that suits Linda. Thank you so much, Adam. You're the only one I can count on. What use is a husband if he's just trouble, am I right? Adam? - I'll see Linda for a minute, excuse me. - Yes, go ahead. Your mother invited me. Oh, okay. Thank you for coming. Take that! Out of breath yet? Come here! Serves you right! You want to seduce my wife! You even want to take my wife? You'll find everything you need to become Cicakman inside this chest. Ouch. It feels like hemorrhoids. This is so uncomfortable. Just a little, Man. As long as I get to be Cicakman. Why is this kid crawling here? Ouch. Uh... Suddenly, this old man is here. I was just dreaming a bit. Crazy. Good morning, Metrofulus. May you always be in good cheer with our newest superhero, SuperBro. Hashtag "SuperBro" is now taking over social media and is a trending topic at coffee shops and hijab stores. So, if you're listening to Metrofulus FM... Hi, sir, good morning. BULUH INN NIGHT CLUB SINGER WANTED Is this the place that's looking for a new singer? Yes. That's right, sir.

This is the additional information from the Red Ants Gang, sir. - I'll call you back. Thank you. - All right. Thank you. How could you choose a job like this? A job like this is tiring. But it's quite fun. You get to see people's offices. Oh, no. Why is he looking at me? Why are you looking at him? Just do your job. Hey, do your work. Or else I'll make you. No, I'm stuck. Help. I'm stuck. - Oh, no! - Man! POLICE TONGUE POWER METROFULUS POLICE HEADQUARTERS My apologies. Why didn't you tell me you had the power of Cicakman? I just had the power of Cicakman.

Why are you suddenly asking me that? I have a job that is suitable for you. - Singing at Buluh Inn. - Keep walking. Why did you stop? Do you see that? Linda. So sweet. - I haven't sang in a while. - Sweet, my ass. That's my wife. Besides, the neighborhood of Hampas Road is like... - It's not like it used to be. - What are you worried about? That's my patrol area. I'll be there. - Let's go home. - No. You go ahead. Man, please don't look for trouble. No, I just want to solve it. Fine. Hello. - One moment. - Yes. I'm outside. What are you doing? I'm having a work discussion. Can we talk later? Work discussion or a date? What are you talking about? Are you stalking me? Why me? What am I lacking? This guy again. Don't you have other places? Sir! Sir! Look! Who's crazy? Me or you? Fly man! So high. How? Who peed on that pole? It's too salty. It's okay, we'll go that way.

Another armed robbery happened at a bank. At four in the afternoon yesterday. You're wearing wrestling shoes. Where are you off to? Don't you see all the crimes being reported on TV, huh? Now, Metrofulus city is swimming in crime. If not Cicakman and SuperBro, who else could save Metrofulus? It's up to me. Where are the bike keys? I need to borrow it. Hey, you're only Cicakman. You can do small cases, like saving some cats, helping people cross the road, helping people move houses. That's it. SuperBro on the other hand, he can handle the bigger cases. If you won't lend me the bike, there is no need to belittle me. Remember, if you're stuck later, don't call Cicakman for help. I'm a superhero. I can use all sorts of transportation. COMMISIONER KAHAR MURDERED Sorry. I was reading the newspaper. Next station, Beringin Rendang. Faster, camera! Shoot! Sit down! What the hell is this? Did you see him? I don't know. Ugh! What kind of mucus bullets are you using? You're fighting me with water guns? Hey, don't kick! Damn you, pole! Hey! NO RECORD You're endangering the lives of the public. Amateur superhero. Just let me deal with this. GRASSHOPPER GANG Grasshoppers! Yes, thank you. I'm just carrying out my duty. In the incident just now, four criminals believed to be members of the Grasshopper Gang had rushed in at the Beringin Rendang station... Everything's okay. Everyone's safe. I saved everyone. - However, SuperBro, - Cicakman saved the day. The criminals, and the weapons have not been found. Did you see me saving everyone? I jumped and kicked? That's not silat pulut. Not the silat you see at weddings. I'll look for a witness to learn the actual situation of the scene. Need a witness? I can be a witness. - What outfit are you wearing? - I can be a witness. I'm the new Cicakman. Cicakman? - Yes. - Okay. Ignore that. According to sources, SuperBro said something to you. Perhaps you can share that with us. In the incident earlier, it was actually me who initially fought the criminals to save the train. Suddenly, SuperBro appeared. So, SuperBro arrived right on time and saved the day. Correct? Yes, SuperBro saved the day. So you agree that SuperBro is awesome? He is awesome. - He came at the right moment. - That's true. All right. Those were the facts. A witness here shared that... Cicakman's era is done. Just go home. Who are you? Me? I'm Cicakman, the superhero of Metrofulus. What operating system are you running on? You look like a pencil box with all those lights. How about we work together? We can start a team of superheroes like the Avengers. Do you like that? Avengers my foot. Metrofulus is tiny. It only needs one superhero. That superhero is me. SuperBro. Respect, Bro. I want to give you a gift of friendship. What's wrong with you? You think I don't feel pain? What style is this? It hurts more than circumcision. That's funny. I'll teach you what it means. No wonder you wear a mask. You look like a turtle. You think you're so good looking? At least it's not Botox. Not plastic surgery. It's original. Really? Let me try. Hey, pencil box. Feel the wrath of a lizard who's lost his tail. Take this as your first and last warning. It's not only the gangsters who have territories. SuperBro has them, too. You're not fit to become a superhero. You should be aware of your own abilities. Understand, Cicakman? BULUH INN NIGHT CLUB, LINDA E Linda works here? This is not a good place. It's nighttime. Don't speak so loud. Where's Linda? She went out. Who is she out with? She's with Adam, I think. Who's that, Mom? Some salesman. Have you seen my phone? I've been looking for it the whole day. I haven't noticed it. It's okay, I'll help you look for it. Okay, thank you, Mom. - Out. - What's wrong? Hello, SuperBro. Your name is so funny. Do you know what your boys have done? They used the duplicate weapons before it's time. No one was supposed to be aware of your activities. Didn't you deal with that? No one got arrested. The weapons you stole that day, I've duplicated them in large numbers. After this, the Grasshopper Gang will become the Grasshopper Army. Hassan! Did you know that Cicakman appeared last night? Don't you have other names to speak of? It's always Cicakman. My ears are bleeding! If SuperBro didn't appear yesterday, your boys would've ended up in police custody. When they get caught and thrown into jail, everyone will know that SuperBro is in cahoots with Grasshopper Gang! SuperBro's image will be tarnished. Adam's career will be destroyed. Now, the Red Ants Gang, they took photos of me with you and passed them to Commissioner Kahar. If I were arrested... who'd look after you guys? Didn't you kill Commissioner Kahar? Just kill Cicakman, too. I have a gift for you. It's your new toy. After this, I don't want to hear about Cicakman being in the way of my business.

Adam, I want to ask you one thing. I passed by Buluh Inn Night Club. I saw the Grasshopper Gang thugs loading boxes into trucks. It's weird. Don't you know? You're a cop. Seems suspicious. It was nothing though. They were just helping the club boss that night. Adam, stop! - You've worked for years, still bad. - Hang on a second. Adam. - It's heavy. - Hey. What are you doing? Why are you demolishing this memorial? It's rusty. Many have complained. It's a hazard. The rust is not our fault. You never maintained it. Don't be so emotional. We're just doing our job. Are you in a K-pop group, Adam? Grip his head. Get his ear. Oh, God. SuperBro. What are you doing here? Respect, Bro. - Is this Man's house? - Yes. I'm his best friend.

Delivery delayed by Cicakman He's been shot dead Faster. Faster, faster! EXTRAORDINARY TONGUE POWER AGILE AND FLEXIBLE SELF-HEALING Seriously. Hey. Hey. Boboi's counting on you. Don't disappoint him. Auntie, sis, can I borrow this shirt? Sorry, it's an emergency. I'll return it later. Muscular guy. It's okay. I have Cicakman's full power! SCHOOL FIELD It's okay, you're still my champ, okay? Boboi. What place did he get? What place did he get? Mom, where is his trophy? I'll be upstairs for a bit, okay? Mom, I want ice cream. You want ice cream? Let me buy it for you. Please take him away. Do you have cash? Can you help to buy Boboi's ice cream? "I love hot boys"? Thanks, Mom. You were late. You know today's important for Boboi. Where were you? Hear me out. You have to hear my story. Okay, on the way here, I suddenly saw a van behind the club where you sing. I tried to stop them, and they shot at me. The bullets went in and came back out. Touch this. Isn't it firm? Wow. Of all the excuses I've heard, today's one is the most classic. How is it classic? It's jazz. You have to listen to my story. I never want to see your face again. Stay away from me and Boboi. Okay. Turn around. Sure. After that, I think my lungs told the bullets to get out, and they went out just like that. No, listen first. Just now, you didn't want to look at my face. Who told me Cicakman is dead? Who? Tell me. I met him here. - Don't take too long. - Don't play around like this. I have a lot of things to do. Do you know how many days we have left? Yes, I know. I can kill Cicakman. Don't interrupt my work. Make sure to handle all the weapons to duplicate. The diamond jubilee is in two days. Get ready to take over the country. - Hey, were you spying on me? - I wasn't spying. You're just like your father. Liar. You're done for. What did you hear? I didn't do or hear anything. You think I really wanted to see you here? I didn't ask you to come. You... Listen up. Don't tell anyone I scolded you. If I hear about it, I'll bury you alive with your father and grandmother. Okay? - Okay? - Understood. - Okay? - Linda. The bullets were real. - Enough. Stay away from us. - Number 4 is okay, too, Boboi. Okay. Bye, Boboi. Let's go home. Why are you staring at them for so long? I was consoling Boboi. He got fourth place. Poor kid. I can console him. It's different. We are not the same. Linda. Linda! Let her go. Why? She's my wife. Linda! You should realize where you stand, Man. Remember that. - Grasshopper... - Gang! - Grasshopper... - Gang! - Grasshopper... - Gang! What's the matter? Your slogan is terrible. Mom, this machine is not the same as dad's throws. It's okay, you can do it. Try again. Enough. I don't want to play anymore. I want to buy drinks. I'm thirsty. Mister. Dad! What are you doing here? It's a long story. I came here to make sure you and Mom are safe. Are you still mad at me? What do you usually use to appease me? Kit Kat. I have it. But I already ate half. Can we share? Does Mom know you're here? Your mom... No, I didn't know he's here. Hang on, dear. Why are you suddenly here? I just wanted to see you and our son. Is that not allowed? You can. He's your son. But you can't just show up and disappear as you please. Linda, I'm just trying to ensure your safety. Boboi's safety. That's it. Do you know? A lot of things have changed since we've been apart. Man, since we've been apart, everything's fine. Yes, a lot of things changed, but Boboi and I are okay. - Maybe you don't understand, Linda. - No. You're the one who doesn't understand. Just move on, Man. Move on. I've moved on with my life. Our paths are too different. What did I do wrong? I've never changed, Linda. Yes, that's the problem. You never change. Grow up. We were in love. Now we have a son. There's a responsibility. Don't forget our divorce hearing in court. Boboi. Dad. Boboi. Why? What's with you and Mom? When are we moving back in together? Boboi, when you grow up... you'll have many friends. There will be those who'll really want to be your friend. Even when Mom and I are gone, they'll still want to be your friend. But there will also be those who'll not wish to be your friend anymore. You mean, you and Mom are no longer friends? It's okay, Boboi. I'll just ask one thing of you. I want you to look after Mom well. Maybe I will be homeless. So you must take care of Mom. - Promise me. - Promise. - Dad, I want to tell you something. - What is it? About Uncle Adam. He... Boboi, say goodbye to Dad. Goodbye. What is it with you? You've been down for the past few days. Why? If you went through what I did that day... You'd be traumatized too, Man. You'd be traumatized. My problem is bigger than yours. What problem? Linda is getting close to Adam. You still haven't told them you're Cicakman? Why would I tell them? I'm tired of being Cicakman. Metrofulus doesn't want Cicakman. They don't like Cicakman. They're always chanting SuperBro's name! Don't say "SuperBro". Don't! I'm tortured, Man. I hate it. Man, you're Cicakman. You have extraordinary powers. You're supposed to help people who are oppressed, like me, Man. I've been sullied, Man. I am pure no more. You were the one who found it hardest to believe that I am Cicakman. But now you're asking me for help? Fine! If you won't help, I'll jump off now! Go ahead! - I'll count to three! - Count! - One! - Two! Man! Three! Man! I haven't taken a dump in days. Don't you pity me? I've decided, Jojo. I'm leaving Cicakman. I won't leave you anymore. That's my promise, okay? You're so sweet, Man! What did I do wrong? I've never changed, Linda. Yes, that's the problem. You never change! Grow up! How long are you going to stay obsessed with Cicakman? If you can't change for me, do it for Boboi. You're a bad guy, Adam? The lizard is right.

Adam, I only see you as a friend. No more than that. I'm still in love with Man. I'm just hoping that he'd change. It's always Man. You're always talking about Man. Why? Okay, I'm sorry. If that is your wish, I will abide. I will abide. I told him to play the second song, but he still played the first one. I just don't get him. Police are trying to track down Inspector Adam Faiz who was confirmed to be the murderer of Commissioner Kahar, his own brother. From the evidence handed in by Cicakman yesterday, he has also been linked with the Grasshopper Gang. He is the prime suspect in... Man! Hi, Brother. Are you dragging a dead body? It's rice to be donated to orphans. - Just joking, Brother. - Yes! Stupid! - Adam! - Yes, Madam Zaleha? Adam, did you really kill Commissioner Kahar? What are you talking about? It's being broadcast now on TV that you murdered Commissioner Kahar. There's evidence handed in by Cicakman at the police station, is that right? Adam, right now, Linda and Boboi are with you, right? Adam! I want to speak to Man. Hello, who's speaking? Just say SuperBro. SuperBro? - Hello. - Man, I want you to come to Metrofulus Fun Park at eight o'clock sharp tonight. Adam? You're SuperBro? I knew it. - Where's Linda and Boboi? - Hey, I know you're Cicakman, too. Adam, I know who you are. You've been helping the Grasshopper Gang steal weapons and you also murdered Commissioner Kahar because he found out about your activities. Yes. I did murder Commissioner Kahar. You want me to murder your wife and son? You want to hear their voices? Okay. - Dad, help! - Man, please help us! Your son and wife wants to see Cicakman. And don't ever think I'll hesitate to kill them if my orders are not followed. - Don't you dare touch my wife and son! - Then come here, I'll be waiting. SuperBro! METROFULUS FUN PARK SPECIAL GUEST SUPERBRO SuperBro! SuperBro! SuperBro! SuperBro! SuperBro! SuperBro! SuperBro! SuperBro! SuperBro! Thank you for supporting SuperBro, Metrofulus' number one hero. Respect, Bro! Be patient. Today, I will reveal and take the chance to tell everyone here about a policeman who has been slandered for murdering his own brother, Commissioner Kahar, by none other than... Cicakman! Inspector Adam Faiz. A brave and courageous police officer but accused of killing Commissioner Kahar. It's impossible for Inspector Adam to kill Commissioner Kahar, because... I am Inspector Adam. Commissioner Kahar was killed by Cicakman! Don't believe him, Mum. He's a liar. I know, Boboi. Jealous of SuperBro's success, he murdered Commissioner Kahar so that I will be arrested. When I am arrested, so ends the legend of SuperBro, the number one hero of Metrofulus! Adam! Where's my son and wife? Cicakman. Hey! You're just two minutes late, Man. Sorry. Hey, you're using bullets! It's not fair! Another one! - Let go! - Dear! Dear... Take this! - No need for heroics. - Ouch. It's okay, SuperBro. We'll help you. We'll fire our sling shots at Cicakman! Yes! Respect, Bro! Good job, everyone. I'll sign posters for you. Give me five! Get up, Cicakman! What do you want from me, Adam? That's such a cliché question. Who's writing your scripts? - Boboi, what are you doing? - I want to save Dad. - Don't harm Linda and Boboi! - Adam! Please do not hurt Man! That's true. It's not good to torture uncircumcised animals. I'll end your suffering. Play it! Yes, I did murder Commissioner Kahar. You want me to murder your son and wife? You want to hear their voices? Okay. - Help, Dad! - Please help us, Man! Hey! Hey! Hey! Why is it dark? Who was playing with slingshots? Just you wait! I'll twist your underpants! Boboi move away from the glass. Take that, Cicakman! Move aside! Where will you run, Cicakman? I didn't run, I rolled. Move away! Man! Dad! Linda! Boboi! Are you okay? Man! Hey! Linda. Why didn't you listen to me? You're stubborn! Rozi was the same, that's was why I killed her. Boboi! Dad! Dad, get up! Boboi. Please forgive me, Boboi. I've failed, Boboi. Dad, you just got bombed. If it was anyone else, they would have died. Just now I saw SuperBro switching off his power. I believe in you, Dad. Just follow what I tell you. Boboi? You want to be a hero? Get up! Show your heroics to your son! Get up, Cicakman. Show your prowess. Cicakman can heal himself right, Dad? So you have to hang in there. Keep your spirit up. Don't give up, Man. Fight back. Dad isn't losing, Mum. He knows what he is doing. Hit me! Hit me again! Dad is absorbing his hits until his battery depletes. I'm the number one hero of Metrofulus. When he shuts down his power, that's when you fight back. Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! Get up, Dad. - Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! - Get up, Dad! Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! I'll teach you! Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! Cicakman! Dad, push him into the water. - Man! - Dad! - Dad... - Linda... Boboi. Are you okay? You're safe, Linda. Thank God you're safe! Linda... I'm hungry. Dad, you're the superhero I love the most. Cicakman. You thought I didn't bring a powerbank? DANGER SYSTEM BREACHED BY WATER Ouch! Why are you hitting me? With that, I, Mayor of Metrofulus, hand over the key to the city of Metrofulus to Mister Cicakman! MY SON-IN-LAW IS CICAKMAN Yes! I cannot accept this medal. No. Not yet. Cicakman has to be handsome. Thank you, Mayor. Forgive me. I couldn't accept this medal behind this mask, because I am accepting this medal as a human being, as a citizen of Metrofulus. Cicakman is a symbol of courage within me that I never found before. I wouldn't have dared to be a loving husband and a good father before I got to know myself. It's not easy for me to be Cicakman, but it is also not easy to lose love from my wife and son whom I love. They are the greatest gifts of my life. When people award you a medal, just take it. It's a Friday night, I want to watch wrestling. Alright, I accept this medal. That's my son-in-law! Linda. Boboi. I'm so proud of you. I've been waiting for you to say this for a long time. On this historic day, I officiate the new Cicakman memorial. Cicakman, the number one hero of Metrofulus! Wear this. Look! Mayor, why does his nose look so big? I guess it's the contractor's fault.
