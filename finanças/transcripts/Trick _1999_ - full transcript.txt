OH, BELIEVE ME, GABRIEL, I KNOW. I KNOW. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I'D--I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR THIS, BUT COULD YOU-- TURN AROUND? SURE. YEAH, I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM. OH, YEAH. IT WAS 2 YEARS AGO, GAY PRIDE DAY. I WAS ON THE TRAIN GOING HOME FROM THE FESTIVITIES, AND HE WAS SITTING ACROSS FROM ME... SLEEPING. BUT HE WASN'T REALLY SLEEPING. OH, NO. HE WAS PRETENDING TO SLEEP, BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE LOOKS LIKE AN ANGEL WHEN HE'S SLEEPING AND NOT THE ANTICHRIST HE REALLY IS. AND EVEN THOUGH I COULD TELL HE WAS FAKING, I WENT ALONG WITH IT. CALL ME CRAZY. I DON'T KNOW. ANYWAY, WE STARTED TALKING, AND HE GIVES ME SOME LINE ABOUT SOME OLD LADY HE LIVES WITH, AND HE ASKS IF HE CAN GO BACK TO MY PLACE. I TOLD HIM. I DON'T INVITE STRANGERS UP TO MY APARTMENT. AND THEN HE LOOKS DOWN AT HIS CROTCH AND THEN BACK UP AT ME, AND HE SAYS, "IT'S BIG, "IT'S BEAUTIFUL, AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE IT." AND I SAID, "OH... ALL RIGHT." AND... AS HE WALKED ME BACK TO MY APARTMENT ON THAT GAY NIGHT OF NIGHTS... [KNOCK ON DOOR] HE TOOK MY HAND GENTLY INTO HIS. AND FOR A MOMENT, I FELT LIKE THE LUCKIEST DRAG QUEEN IN THE WORLD. AND I FANTASIZED-- "YES. THIS IS IT. "THIS IS THE MAN I'M GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH." I'D BE THE ONE TO SHOW HIM THE VIRTUES OF A LOVING HEART. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE TOOK THAT HEART, HE TOSSED IT ON THE FLOOR. WITH HIS LITTLE SATAN HOOFS, HE JUMPED... HE JUMPED HARD. THE TRUTH IS, GABRIEL, WHEN WE GOT BACK TO MY APARTMENT, HE GRABBED ME. HE THREW ME ON THE BED. HE TORE OFF ALL MY CLOTHES. WILL YOU HOLD ON ONE GODDAMN MINUTE?! Man: COME ON! JESUS CHRIST. NOW I FORGOT WHERE I WAS. WHERE WAS I? THREW YOU ON THE BED, TORE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES. RIGHT. RIGHT. SO I'M LICKING HIS BALLS. NEXT THING I KNOW, HE COMES IN MY EYE, AND HE'S OUT THE DOOR. GONE. YOU EVER GET COME IN YOUR EYE, GABRIEL, HMM? IT BURNS. SO, THERE I WAS LYING IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BED COMPLETELY NAKED WITH AN EYE FULL OF COME, THINKING TO MYSELF, "OH. "OH. OH, NO." AND THEN, THE NEXT DAY, WHEN I CALL THE NUMBER HE'D GIVEN ME EARLIER, IT WAS THE BROOKLYN BOTANICAL GARDENS. AND WOULD BELIEVE? THEY NEVER EVEN HEARD OF A MARK MIRANDA. BUT AM I BITTER? ABSOLUTELY. LET'S FACE IT, GABRIEL. YOU ARE JUST ANOTHER LITTLE PHONE NUMBER ON A DIRTY COCKTAIL NAPKIN SHOVED INTO THE BOTTOM OF HIS POCKET. [URINATES] GOOD BOY. BUT... DO WHAT YOU WILL. I ONLY OFFER YOU THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE I'M A GIVER. WHO KNOWS? MAYBE SOMEDAY WE'LL MEET AGAIN, AND I'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT YOU AND SAY, "GABRIEL." "GABRIEL. "OOH...

WHY'D YOU COME BACK? YOU'RE UPSET. NO, NO, I'M NOT UPSET. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE THERE. NO, NO. NO. IT WAS GOOD WE WENT. REALLY. [SIGHS] YOU DIDN'T NEED TO COME BACK. YES, I DID. CAN WE GO IN AND TALK? THEY'RE, UH... THEY'RE STILL GOING AT IT. OH. YEAH, SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY... YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO HOME. I CAN'T. I THINK I LEFT MY KEYS IN YOUR APARTMENT. I'LL KNOCK.

UH, MARK THINKS HE LEFT HIS KEYS. JUDY, DO YOU SEE SOME KEYS? Judy: WHERE'D YOU LEAVE THEM? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE NEAR THE BED. I DON'T SEE THEM. MAYBE YOU GUYS SHOULD JUST COME IN AND LOOK. Gabriel: OK. IT'LL BE FASTER THAT WAY. [LAUGHS] NO. YOU'RE NOT COMING IN. RICH... HE CAN'T GO HOME UNTIL HE FINDS HIS KEYS! ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU BETTER BE GONE BY THE TIME I'M OUT OF THE BATHROOM. ALL RIGHT. HI, GABRIEL. HI. CAN YOU HELP US LOOK? WELL, WHERE WOULD THEY BE? I'M NOT SURE. GABRIEL... DID YOU GUYS JUST MEET EACH OTHER TONIGHT? YEAH. CAN WE MAKE THIS AS FAST AS POSSIBLE? AND YOU WANT TO DO EACH OTHER? YEAH. GABRIEL, HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST THIS GUY? YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW A THING ABOUT HIM. YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL. I THINK IT'S KIND OF A TURN-ON, DON'T YOU? ANONYMOUS SEX-- THAT'S PRETTY HOT. YEAH, PRETTY HOT. LET'S JUST LOOK FOR THE KEYS. THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT ANONYMOUS SEX-- YOU CAN SAY YOU'RE JUST ABOUT ANYONE, AND YOUR PARTNER CAN'T DISAGREE. DO YOU WANT TO SEE I.D.? WELL, I DO. OH, YOU WENT TO A SOONIE SCHOOL? WHAT'D YOU MAJOR IN? JOURNALISM. WELL, HIS NAME'S REALLY MARK, GABE. I--I DON'T SEE THEM. WHEN YOU KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT A PERSON, SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO THINK OF THEM SEXUALLY, BUT WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE ONLY IN A SEXUAL WAY, IT'S HARD TO THINK OF THEM AS A PERSON. CAN I HAVE MY WALLET BACK? I WANT TO BE A SEX COUNSELOR SOMEDAY. THAT'S MY DREAM. GREAT. YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY, AS A SEXUALLY ACTIVE FEMALE, I FIND THE IDEA OF 2 MEN GETTING IT ON INCREDIBLY HOT. ARE YOU SURE THEY'RE HERE? NO, I'M NOT SURE. CAN YOU STAND STILL FOR A SECOND AND LET ME EXPLAIN? NO. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY-- EVERYONE'S BISEXUAL TO A DEGREE. BUT TO A DEGREE, EVERYONE IS. THERE'S THIS PART IN PARIS WHERE EVERYONE'S BI-- EVERYONE. THERE'S NO STRAIGHT, THERE'S NO GAY-- JUST BI, AND ANYONE WHO HASN'T BEEN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW. IT'S GREAT. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO PARIS, GABRIEL? NO. I BET YOU HAVE, HAVEN'T YOU, MARK? CAN WE JUST FIND THE KEYS? OOH, IT HASN'T BEEN A VERY GOOD NIGHT FOR SOMEONE. YOU GUYS DONE YET? WE'RE LOOKING! WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET, GABRIEL? I'M NOT UPSET. GABRIEL? OK, I'M UPSET. DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT? NO. WELL, THAT'S VALID. MARK? I'M SORRY. WE NEVER SHOULD'VE GONE TO THAT CLUB. YOU WERE KISSING HIM. DINO'S THIS GUY I USED TO DATE, AND, ACTUALLY, HE WAS KISSING ME, BUT, TECHNICALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT, AND I'M SORRY. I GUESS--I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T USUALLY GO THERE WITH ANYBODY. ESPECIALLY NOT SOMEBODY I... I-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME. GABRIEL, I THINK NOW IS A GOOD TIME FOR YOU TO VERBALIZE YOUR FEELINGS. WHY DID YOU JUST LEAVE? WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING TO ME? GABRIEL! I PAY RENT HERE, TOO, YOU KNOW! GABRIEL, MAYBE MARK DESERVES TO KNOW WHY YOU LEFT WITHOUT TELLING HIM. I LEFT BECAUSE OF WHAT THE DRAG QUEEN IN THE BATHROOM TOLD ME. THERE WAS A DRAG QUEEN IN THE BATHROOM? HERE WE GO. WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID A LOT, BUT THE GIST OF IT WAS THAT TONIGHT WAS JUST A WHOLE ROUTINE FOR YOU. WHAT? TONIGHT. IT WAS ALL LINES. "OH, LOOK AT ME. I'M SLEEPING ON THE SUBWAY." I WAS TIRED. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO STARE. THIS OLD LADY-- I DON'T LIKE BRINGING GUYS BACK TO MY PLACE. AND SO WHAT? I WAS TRYING TO PICK YOU UP. WELL, IT WORKED. WHY IS THAT SUCH A PROBLEM? WHY WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO HIM? I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHOICE. I SLEPT WITH HIM ONE TIME. HE MENTIONED THAT. DID HE ALSO TELL YOU HE VIDEOTAPED IT? OH, SHIT. YEAH. WITHOUT TELLING ME. AND THEN RIGHT WHEN I'M ABOUT TO, YOU KNOW... ORGASM? RIGHT. HE TELLS ME TO MOVE INTO THE LIGHT, AND I FIGURED IT OUT, SO I GRABBED THE TAPE, AND I GOT THE FUCK OUT OF THERE. WELL, HE DIDN'T SAY THAT-- ABOUT THE VIDEO-- BUT HE SAID YOU LEFT. YOU KNOW, THIS WHOLE NIGHT SHOULD'VE BEEN OVER HOURS AGO. IT'S GOTTEN WAY TOO COMPLICATED. I JUST KEEP WAITING FOR THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DUMP ME LIKE YOU DUMPED THAT WHIFFENPOOF. WHAT THE HELL IS A WHIFFENPOOF? A SINGER! OH. I MEAN, I FEEL STUPID SPENDING THIS ENTIRE EVENING LOOKING FOR A PLACE JUST TO GET OFF. OH, IS THAT ALL WE WERE DOING? THAT'S ALL I WAS DOING. REALLY? DEFINITELY. YOU KNOW... I KNOW I PICKED YOU UP ON THE SUBWAY AND ALL, SO I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'D BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN... I DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE GOING ON TONIGHT. AND JUST FOR THE RECORD, THE WHIFFENPOOF DUMPED ME. OH. JUDY, YOUR SHEET SLIPPED. AW, SHIT. COVER YOURSELF. WOULD YOU LIGHTEN UP? BUT YOUR TITTIES ARE HANGING OUT. YOU KNOW, IN EUROPE, BREASTS ARE BREASTS. THEY'RE VERY NATURAL AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS. JUST-- WOULD YOU LET ME BE? PUT THEM AWAY, JUDY. IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING WOULD'VE HAPPENED. YOU'RE NOT IN PARIS ANYMORE. IS THIS THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN ACTING THE PAST 6 MONTHS, HUH, JUDY? YES. FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS, I'VE BEEN TOURING FRANCE TOPLESS. AND YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING? NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE. GET OVER IT, RICH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JUDY? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING? CAN'T YOU SEE I'M GETTING DRESSED? I'M GOING HOME TO MY GRANDMOTHER'S IN CONNECTICUT. LOOK, HERE'S THE KEYS. I KNEW YOU WERE DIFFERENT WHEN I SAW YOUR HAIRY ARMPITS. HEY! MARK! JUDY FOUND YOUR KEYS. THANKS. [TRAIN ARRIVES] ARE YOU HUNGRY? [DOOR BELL CHIMES] OH, MY GOD, IT'S SO HYSTERICAL THAT YOU GUYS ARE HERE. ISN'T THAT HILARIOUS? FRENCH FRIES. THANK YOU. THANKS. YOU KNOW, GABE, IT'S REALLY GOOD YOU DIDN'T COME TO THE SHOW TONIGHT. WE WERE REALLY OFF. YOU WANT SOME? YEAH. ANYWAY, THE GIRL PLAYING JOHN THE BAPTIST-- HORRIBLY ALLERGIC TO GLADIOLAS-- WHO KNEW? SO THERE'S A CHANCE I MIGHT GO ON TOMORROW NIGHT. DIDN'T WE ORDER CHEESE FRIES? OH, YEAH. SHOULD WE TELL HER? WE'RE OUT OF THOUSAND ISLAND. I GAVE YOU RANCH. OH, WELL. OH, MY GOD, I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS REALLY ARTSY PARTY THIS FRENCH-CANADIAN GIRL IN MY ACTING CLASS THREW. EVERYONE THERE, THEY WROTE, LIKE, POEMS OR NOVELLAS. SO THIS ONE COLLEGE GUY-- HE WAS ASIAN-- HE GETS UP WITH THIS LITTLE LEATHERETTE PORTFOLIO WITH A SATIN RIBBON TO TIE IT SHUT, AND HE'S GOING TO READ POETRY. BUT BEFORE HE STARTS READING, HE TELL US ABOUT HIS FASCINATION WITH THE HUMAN BODY. BUT HE SAYS WHAT FASCINATES HIM EVEN MORE IS WHAT COMES OUT OF THE HUMAN BODY. OH, I KNOW I'M LACTOSE INTOLERANT, BUT I REALLY WISH THESE HAD CHEESE ON THEM. ANYWAY, EVIDENTLY, HE'S TASTED EVERYTHING THAT'S COME OUT OF HIS BODY EXCEPT SHIT, AND HE SAYS HE'LL PROBABLY TASTE THAT ONE DAY, TOO. AND THEN HE READS A POEM ABOUT SHIT, SO I'M THINKING, THIS GUY REALLY LIKES SHIT, RIGHT? BUT THEN HE KEEPS READING, AND HE READS 17 POEMS-- ALL ABOUT SHIT. 17--I'M NOT KIDDING. AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE SMELLS AND THE COLORS-- GABE, CAN YOU PASS ME THE KETCHUP? THANKS. ANYWAY, I WAS SO RELIEVED WHEN HE GOT TIRED OF READING. THEN THIS ETHNIC WOMAN STANDS UP. SHE WAS, LIKE, NATIVE AMERICAN OR FILIPINO. I CAN NEVER REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE A POEM TO READ, SO SHE TELLS US ABOUT A PROBLEM SHE'S HAVING-- THIS SEX PROBLEM. SHE SAID THERE'S, LIKE, SOME FORCE THAT'S JUST MAKING HER SCREW AROUND ALL THE TIME. NOW ALL THESE GUYS ARE AFTER HER, AND, I MEAN, SHE'S NOT WHAT I WOULD CALL SEXY. WELL, NOT THAT I'M INTO WOMEN THAT WAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN TELL WHEN A WOMAN'S SEXY. I MEAN, IT'S NOT THAT SHE WAS A SKANK OR ANYTHING. SHE JUST WASN'T WHAT I WOULD CALL SEXY, THAT'S ALL. SO, ANYWAY-- THIS IS REALLY FUNNY-- I DRANK SO MUCH HOMEMADE ROSE HIP ICED TEA THAT I REALLY HAD TO PEE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF HER STORY, RIGHT? SO I GET UP, I GO TO THE BATHROOM, BUT THE BATHROOM DOOR'S LOCKED, SO I'M KIND OF STANDING THERE. I'M LOOKING AT THE WALLPAPER, WHICH WAS REALLY KIND OF GIVING ME A HEADACHE. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE TOILET FLUSHES. THE DOOR OPENS, AND THE SHIT GUY WALKS OUT, AND HE'S SMILING. AND NOT ONE OF THOSE POLITE ACKNOWLEDGMENT SMILES, HE'S, LIKE, SMILING, LIKE HE'S HAPPY ABOUT SOMETHING. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I DIDN'T HAVE TO PEE ANYMORE. HOW'S EVERYTHING? FINE. EVERYTHING'S FINE. WANT TO HEAR THE AUDITION MONOLOGUE I'M WORKING ON? NO, I HAVE KATHERINE-- NEW INTENTIONS. KA... YOU REALLY DON'T GET IT. WHAT? YOU'VE BEEN-- YOU HAVE BEEN MONOPOLIZING THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION SINCE WE GOT HERE. LOOK, YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, BUT RIGHT NOW, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR AUDITION MONOLOGUE. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU SIT DOWN, INVITE YOURSELF OVER, AND--AND--AND TALK ABOUT SHIT. I WAS JUST TALKING. I KNOW, BUT-- WHY... WHY ARE YOU BEING SUCH A JERK ALL OF A SUDDEN? YEAH. SHIT'S FUNNY. SHIT'S SHIT. GIVE IT A REST, YOU NANCY PRISS ASS, AND LET US ENJOY OURSELVES. Man: YEAH. OK. OK. I PROMISE I'LL CALL TOMORROW. I PROMISE I'LL SEE YOUR SHOW, BUT RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO BE ALONE WITH MARK. PLEASE, DON'T RUIN THIS FOR ME. GABRIEL, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? GO SOMEPLACE ELSE. TAKE YOUR GIRLFRIENDS. PRACTICE YOUR AUDITION MONOLOGUE ON THEM-- WHATEVER-- BUT PLEASE JUST GO. YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME THAT YOU INSINUATE THAT I SHOULD SLEEP WITH WOMEN, I FEEL LIKE-- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. I DON'T KNOW. I--I--I-- I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO RESPOND RESPECTFULLY, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT I THINK THAT IT'S WRONG OR IT'S BAD I DIDN'T OR IT'S NASTY. MEAN-- BUT YOU BRING IT UP EVERY 5 MINUTES. IT'S ANNOYING--THE MOST ANNOYING THING ABOUT YOU. DON'T GET UPSET. I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP WITH WOMEN! I'M SORRY, GWEN. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHY. YOU'RE NOT KAT-- THAT WAY. THAT'S WHY. KATHERINE-- YES, I CAN. I CAN. THIS MAY BE HARD FOR YOU TO BELIEVE, GAY BOY, BUT I AM HETEROSEXUAL. YES. YES! THERE ARE SUCH THINGS AS HETEROSEXUALS IN THIS WORLD, AND I AM ONE OF THEM. BUT YOU WON'T LISTEN TO ME. YOU WON'T DROP THE SUBJECT. JUST BECAUSE IT BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH, IT'S OBVIOUS YOU HAVE LESBIAN ISSUES YOU'RE TOO AFRAID TO FACE. I HAVE LESBIAN ISSUES? I DON'T HAVE LESBIAN ANYTHING! GOD, IT'S LIKE WHEN MY DAD ASKED WHY I WON'T MOVE TO NEW JERSEY. WHAT? IF I MOVE TO NEW JERSEY, IT WOULD TAKE ME AN HOUR AND A HALF JUST TO GET TO AN AUDITION. CAN YOU IMAGINE MY DAD SAYING, "I CAN TELL BY YOUR REACTION "THERE'S A PART OF YOU THAT WANTS TO MOVE, BUT YOU'RE JUST TOO AFRAID TO FACE IT"? HOLY WOW. GOD, DOESN'T ANYBODY HERE GET IT?
