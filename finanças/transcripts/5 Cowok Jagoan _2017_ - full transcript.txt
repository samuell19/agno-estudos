I am a professional. I do my job without compromise, anytime. This is a story of five heroes. And I am one of them. It's me. Move left a bit! Not that one. Move right! It was too far. Move left a little bit. A bit more. Zoom in! That's me. I am one of the heroes. Again, a professional who does the job without compromise, fearlessly, anytime. And I know exactly the time to... take a rest. But, there's a time to surpass the limit, because anybody can be a hero, for a chance and reason. And she is my reason. See? She agrees with me. Who can resist such a request? It's the time. The time for a hero like me to show my best for... Okay, I may look like a loser here. But a hero shall give up chance first. Burglar! Burglar! Mr. Dedi, a burglar broke into someone's house. Calm down, gentlemen! In such a condition, we should keep a cool head. Where did the burglar go? That way, sir. You guys track that way. I'll go that way. What are you up to? In case he's with his gangmates. Yes, sir. Let's go. So disturbing! I've just fallen asleep. I saw nothing. I'm sleeping. It was just a dream. Thank you, sir. I'm dreaming, don't talk to me. Mr. Dedi! Didn't you catch the burglar? We didn't, sir. I bumped into your wife, instead. She wanted to see you at home. Maybe later. I'm going to visit the burgled house. But, sir, it's your house. That's right, sir. On my way back home, I saw the burglar coming out from your house with a... TV? That's right, sir! How could you know? Just a hunch. Sir, wait! We're lucky to have him for security, aren't we? He's got the magic. Mom, I can't see anything! See? Can you hear that? Where were you last night? As you know, I guarded the village. What did you say? You couldn't even keep a TV! Where are you going? I'm not finished yet! Hello? I'm going to your house. What do you want? I'll tell you later, urgent! You're good for nothing! Okay, then. Hurry! I'm already here. So here's the case. I'm here to ask for... No, I can't. I haven't finished yet. I don't have whatever you may ask. Look at that! I don't even have a TV! Nope. Listen, the five of us... Thank you. The five of us have promised... The five of us have promised to help each other. When? Twenty years ago! Let alone 20 years ago, he can't even remember my birthday. August 17! Wrong! It's April 4. Whose birthday is August 17, then? -Your daughter, perhaps? -No, hers is December 25. Wrong again! It's October 7. Okay, just skip it. What do you want? So, here's the case. Since the beginning, you're the most reliable and the most responsible. You're wrong! How could you say that? What kind of security on earth lets a burglar get into his house? Him! Mom, I can't see anything yet! A moment, honey, be patient. Well then, if this bastard helps you, can we get a TV in return? TV? Yes, that thing our daughter used to watch. -That's a piece of cake! -Not a piece of cake. I want a big TV. You heard that? Hurry, help him! I don't even know what he wants, honey. I don't care, as long as you bring a TV. Remember, don't come home unless you get a TV! Don't do something funny! Bring me a TV! Walaikum salam. Mom, can you see some picture? Mom, can you? Mom? Let's go. Do you really have to call on the others? Yes. Can we handle it ourselves? No. What are we up to, anyway? Have you ever felt... an irresistible love? What? Even if mountain stands in my way, sea lies ahead, storm rampages-- Wait a sec. Can you stop it? Okay. Sorry. What love did you say? The true love of mine. -Who? -A girl in my office, Cosmolab. The one on Sudirman? Near that huge TV? So, you work there? What's your position? It's a quite high position, I might say. A "wet" (lucrative) business, huh? You can say so. Her name is Dewi. A girl in my office. We were so close. How close? Really close. I can even smell her scent. She won't let the distance separate us. So, what's the problem? It's not about money, is it? If so, I-- -Dewi was abducted. -What!? Abducted? What's the best theme song for abduction? I've got no idea. -That's enough, thanks. -You're welcome. How come? I'll tell you later, along with the others. Now, let's visit the mommy's boy. To, Ded... Let's get going. Where are you going? What the hell are you wearing? This is my armor. I've upgraded its power. Take it off! What's the problem? You don't know fashion, do you? It's a secret mission. Don't tell anybody. -Okay. -I know. Where are you kids going? I'm about to bring this upstairs. Thank you, Auntie. We're on a mission. What mission? A secret mission. We are about to save a girl from armed abductors. So, is this all you're wearing? Would it be better to dress up in Super Mario costumes? Or the one you bought yesterday? -The one with wings? -Yeah. -But this one will do for now. -Okay. Where's the location, anyway? We're picking up Danu first at Jamblang market. What! Jablay (brothel) market? -It's Jamblang, Mom, not Jablay. -Okay. Let's go. Should I take you there? Thank you, but we don't wanna trouble you. Yes, it is not cool for a secret mission. So you're embarrassed to have mom with you? Well, that's not the case. It's just not necessary. So, I mean nothing to you now? No, Mom, that's not true. Mom, come on, don't be upset. Please, don't be upset, Mom. Okay, then, you may take us there. Wait a moment. I'll get my bag, glasses, car key... Thank you, Auntie Are you sure you don't need me to wait around? I'm sure, Mom. Hey, wait. See you, Mom. Come on, let go of it. Wait, it's hard to get out of here. Come on, don't make it noticeable. Sir! Is it Jablay market? Get out of this body! I command you. Behold! How amazing! Get out of this body! He's still doing that thing. As long as someone is being possessed. Behold the might of my master, Arya KamanDanu! Get out! Water! I'm on it, master. -Behold the might! -So sour! My eyes! So hot! Amazing! The spirit is gone just in a gush. That's my master! -Master. -What? My trousers, please. Here you are. Why are you here? I told you on the phone, I don't wanna join. Come on. It's worthless unless I get paid. If that's your concern, don't doubt Yanto. He's got a high position in his office. Right, To? That's right. Where do you work anyway? Cosmolab. Wow, that's a big company. That's why. The girl we're up to is an important person in the company. So? So, lend me a hand! Do I get paid? That's all that matters to me. Well then, I'll give 50% of my shares in the company to you. -50%? -Yes. Are you sure? They are the witnesses. -Hold on. What's the value of your shares? -What? What's your position there? How about your tax rate? Because I once had a tax problem... Well, then. We have a deal. I want the document on the ownership 50% of your shares. You are the witnesses, okay? Okay, deal. Let's bounce. We have no time to waste. Danu! Danu! -You sure it was two nights ago? -Yes. Waking up, I headed directly to Dedi's house. But look at these news. No one is talking about the abduction. It can't be. Meaning your company is concealing something. Try to find this guy. Are you kidding me? The computer has its limits, To. Hey, Pikachu also painted in this style. Pikachu? Pikachu! That famous painter! It's Pikacho, dumbass! It's Picasso, Ded. So, he changed his name, huh? Can you track Dewi's phone number? Bingo! -You're awesome! -It's child's play. Really? Can you hack into the private banks, huh? Why not the state bank? That's pointless. Many thieves are swarming around it. But, I think we need Reva for such a case. Indeed. Nu, you know his whereabouts, right? I do, but I guarantee he won't join us. He has abandoned his secular life. So, it's only four of us. That's all we have now. -Let's get ready. -Okay. Hey, wait. Slow down. Are you sure about this place? In the middle of a jungle? That's the house. -Looks like an ordinary house, huh? -I agree. Lilo must be wrong. -I thought he was good at hacking. -I thought so. We'd better observe that house for now. Avoid drawing attention. Okay. What the hell is that? Why don't you disguise yourselves? -Anyone can easily spot you, guys! -What the hell are you? No one will see us here. There's no one else here. Dumbass! I have a bad feeling about this. Yeah. My ring also reacts to something. I feel... darkness. Darkness? Curiosity. Bewilderment. Bewilderment? The smell of... death! Excuse me. Oh, God! Where is Kencana Loka 2 number 7? I don't know. You surprised me! -I'll punch you in the face! -Go away! -Shoo-shoo! -Right now! Kencana Loka 2 number... Scram! -I was flabbergasted. -Me too. Hey, wait! Come here! -Delivery service, huh? -Yes. -What was the address? -Kencana Loka 2 number... Perfect! It's over there! See that house? -That one? -Exactly! But, the map says I've got to turn right. Let me see. You're holding it the wrong way. It should be this way. -I've just known about this. -You should've updated the software! Thank you. Excuse me. -What the hell have you done? -Psst. -You know whose house that is? -Just trust me. -This one, right? -You're right. It's locked! Just jump over it! How about if we retreat now and come up with a strategy? Sounds good. We need Reva. You can't or you just don't want to help? I have pledged to avoid violence. They have become one with nature. It's their karma. -Do we really have to pass over them? -I guess so. Forget it, To. However deadly, dangerous, and violent this mission is, he doesn't seem to want to change his mind. But we're already here! Va! What if you return all weapons we stole from the last job? Sorry, Danu, I can't do that either. You're a hypocrite! You said you stopped committing violence. You don't need the weapons, then. -Meanwhile, we need those things-- -I have donated them to charity. What weapons are you talking about? Firearms, eh? Yes, all kinds of them but AK47. What? Is it possible to donate weapons to charity? For the underprivileged army, perhaps. Reva, wait! You've lost your mind, huh? So, you're the one that breaks our promise. What promise? You forgot? We five have made a promise. When did we promise, anyway? I also forgot. When we were kids. In front of my house, we promised to help any one of us who gets into trouble. Then, Reva's head was hit by the falling roof tile. I don't think that's how the story goes. As I remember, we were at the football field. We promised to lend money to any one of us who needs it. No kid thinks of debt, you know! Afterwards, a coconut fell onto his head. You must be tripping. -He's right about his house. -See? But, not in front of it. We were on the roof. You all promised not to treat me as an underdog. Suddenly, Reva's head was hit by the golf ball thrown by the kids playing rounders. What kind of rounders uses golf ball? Now I know why Reva forgot our promise. I remember it, but... Now I remember. It was in front of your house, To. We promised each other to give a TV to any one of us who needs it. He is clearly imagining things. The rounders players threw a stone but missed. The stone flew into your house. Your father got mad. Yanto, You're son of a bitch! Your father threw the stone back and hit Reva's head. Am I right? By the way, how's your father? My father passed away. You know that. Why didn't you tell me, To? I'm your friend, right? You attended his funeral. Well. I don't remember what we promised. But it seems that nothing hit my head. It was on the football field. -I've told you. -Three and two now. But in the evening. Now it's in the evening? The path to happiness, revealed. Embraced me as I am. -His head was surely hit. -Indeed. -Obviously. -Sure. I remember the promise. We must change, for peace. Well, then. You have already donated all the weapons. Now you must help us take them back. I'm so sorry. I won't do that. Excuse me. I'm sorry, my friend. -So, your girl was kidnapped? -It's his. Whose girl got kidnapped? Who? Whose girl got kidnapped? So, your girl got kidnapped? He is our friend! I'll help you! I'll take the weapons! You all right? No one ever yelled at me. Hold on. All right, this is the plan. We'll divert their attention... Let's just do this! or engage in open confrontation. It's not necessary. Trust me. Soldiers, the first thing to learn... is this. Poco-Poco. -We dance to this music? -Yes! Cock the gun! Make it quick. No, no, you should've pulled this. Aim! Fire! Which one is the volume button? What? My gun is gone? Fire! The mag fell off! -Here you go. -Thanks. While inserting the magazine...Wait! Don't point it at your friends! I did aim at that one. Do we really have to do this? Absolutely, no soldier cannot dance to Poco-Poco. Fire! Hold your fire! I'm out of ammo. Not bad at all. But, can you step backwards a little bit. Here? Right, right, left, left, turn around! It's a little bit awkward. Hold the grenade, pull out the pin, throw immediately and find shelter. Okay? -Who wants to try first? -Give it to me! All right. Pull out the pin! Throw! -Are you done, Mom? -Not yet. The follow focus is complicated. The speed is too low. Come on. Once more! Many people on Instagram will like it. All right. Stick to the plan! Don't let your guard down! Focus! Watch each other's back! Stand by on your position! Understood!? What the... Where is everybody? To! What the hell are you doing!? Focus! Stand by on your position! Wimp! -What's the problem with you guys? -The problem is you! Watch out the sensor! Are you ready? Wait a sec. -You done? -Done. Reva-san! Come out all of you! Bunch of scum! What the hell is he doing? -You'd better ring the bell! -The bell! -Any bell around here? -Over there! Let's begin! There's no enemy here? It's level 1, the boss is still far away. Stick to the plan! Don't panic! Okay? -Let's go! -Okay. -Did it hurt? -Yes. Good job, Danu! -Bare hands, if you're brave enough. -What? Bare hands! One by one. Move. It's my turn. But, you said one-by-one. That's right, one person for one fist. You're cheating! Now what? Okay. I'll find the detention room. Okay, I'll wait for Reva here. Okay, I'll find the control room. Okay. Okay for what? Okay, fine, let's move. Captain, we've captured this intruder. Where did you lock up Dewi? Dewi? Where did you lock her up? Dewi? You must be that janitor. Now tell me how this janitor could sneak into our base. Answer me! You are all a bunch of... blockheads! Holly Molly! So many TVs inside there! Those are monitors, not TVs. Come on, they all have screen. So does a car. But they're still different. Whatever. Now send them a code. Tell them what we've got here. What's wrong with you? I'm sending them a code. Animal sounds, right? What sound is that? Why not just cat or owl to avoid suspicion? What sound was that? Blue whale. Blue whale? Are you kidding me? Lilo, can you just imitate other animals? Who will figure it out, then? I think you've got to watch TV more often. Your knowledge is pathetic! Hear me out! First, I have no TV right now. Second, you're indeed a freak! Listen, I'm sure no one knows the sound of a blue whale! Someone's coming. Someone's coming. What's wrong? I heard a strange and suspicious sound around here. What sound? I don't know. A kind of humming and screeching sound. Let it go. It's only a blue whale, I suppose. You're right. Let's go. I told you! Watch TV more often! But... Enough talking! Now you send them the code! -Ded... -What? That's gray whale's sound. I said the blue one! Report the condition of the front gate. Roger, Captain. The front gate is out of sight. Some CCTVs seem to be broken. How's your condition in the control room? The control room is safe. I only heard the sound of a blue whale around here. Did you say blue whale? I often watch Discovery Channel, so I know it. Do you know where our base is? It's in the middle of the jungle, not under the Hindia or Pacific Ocean! Where the hell is your brain? In the head, captain. Find the intruders before I get you and eat you up! Now! Yes, Captain! Now you all go with me to the control room! And bring along this janitor! Have you done it? Which part did you chop? He didn't just pass out. -Which part did you chop, anyway? -Here. -You missed it. -So? You should've chopped right here. I see. Head down, please. Still won't pass out. Try again, harder. Hold on. -Excuse me. -What? Could you do it correctly this time, please? -Is that what you want? -Yes. Please, knock me out in just one hit. -Being a guinea pig is quite tiring. -Should I do it for you? Yes, please. Okay, sorry for this. -I've just taught my friend. -That's fine. Get ready. Close your eyes. One, two, three. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. -What happened to these broken CCTVs? -I don't know. Come here! Why didn't you guys send any codes? -We did! -Yes, we did. Otherwise how did you know we were here? He heard a blue whale or something, I don't know. It was me! That was my voice! Hey, chill out! Hi, gang! So, you are the kidnapper? Seeking death, huh? Hey, wait! Come on, don't use guns. Yeah, don't use cheat codes if you have guts. You're armed, too! What do you mean? See? There's no gun! -Are you sure? -Come on, let go of it! See? We're not armed now. Let's do it bare handed. If you have the guts. Put it down! Kill them all! -They're yours. -Good luck! -You can do it! -Blow them away! Good luck! Get your ass over here! How did he do that? Awesome! You're my hero! Wait! No! -What the-- -It's stuck! Hey! That's against the rules! You cheated! Don't use weapons! Ded, give me your staff! Strike his head again, hurry! Bye-bye! I'm your angel of death. Are you really Izrail? That was just a phrase. How about no guns? Don't listen to him! He's a liar! Are you okay? I'm sorry! What do you want? Shoot carefully. But it's not you. -Are they done? -It's done. Is it safe now? Is he dead? Dead or alive, it doesn't matter. Wait. But, he's the only one who knows Dewi's location. I thought she was Dewi. She is not! No! The CCTVs are broken, after all. I broke those CCTVs. Amateurs like you can't do such things. Who the hell are you? To, she's the angel of death. She has mentioned it. You didn't pay attention, did you? Hey! Where are you going? Don't run away! He means, "Would you stay here for a while, please?" Help us find Dewi! If you don't mind. You've killed him! It is unfortunate that you made him pass away. Only he knows where Dewi is. That's right. Why should I care? Wait. Why are you following me? We're not! We're looking for Dewi. That's right. This is a one-way path, after all. Where are you going to search, anyway? How about you? Where are you going? My target is underground. The name is also Dewi? I don't know that person! What a coincidence, our target is in the basement, too. Is that so? We should be honest, my friend... Well then, you may come with me. But, keep your distance! Dewi! You? It's me. I come here to save you. Look, it's Yati. What a lucky day. I've finished my prey... and now I find this traitor. -What the hell is going on here? -Looks like they're having a fight. -I have nothing to do with this. -We'd better pray for them. -Why are they fighting? -I have no idea! Danu, Dedi, do something! Sorry, family business is not my specialty. Same here. I hate seducers. Stop! Hey, stop it! Dewi, stop! It's me! Hey, stop! Hey, stop it! Stop it, stop! This is Deby. She just helped us to get here and rescue you! What the hell! Don't be jealous, Dewi. So, you're Dewi now? Excuse me, can you stop fighting now? Hey, stop fighting now! Look over there! It's okay. Go on. I can wait. Still remember me? -Deby? -Colonel Demon. So disappointing, Captain Yoga was beaten by these weaklings. Hey, don't try something stupid. Troopers! -Dewi! -Don't move! Move! Dewi? Dewi, are you all right? Worry about your girlfriend that much, huh? Look, your friends are hanging by a thread here. So ridiculous, I will die saving my friend's girlfriend. So, this is Yati's new boyfriend? To, is your girlfriend's name Dewi or Yati? Girlfriend? You don't even know her real name! I'm not his girlfriend! I don't even know him. What did you say? Are you kidding? So, this Yati really doesn't know you or what? I work in the same office with her, you know! Come on, don't confuse me! Do you really have a relationship with her? Well, practically speaking... I haven't asked her out yet. What? You've gone too far, To! So, it's true that Yati is not your girlfriend? So, you lied to us all? Love is sometimes-- Shut up! Wait a sec. We are in the same office? Now I remember you. You are the janitor at Cosmolab, right? Janitor? You said you've got a high position in your office! I'm in a high position, indeed. -Confirmed, I'll go home without a TV! -What about my shares? What janitor on earth holds shares? Damn you, To! So, it's all about your fantasy? We're going to die ridiculously for your imaginary romance with this... this girl? You've lost your mind! But, I must admit his crazy effort. Just like those in the soap opera. The title was Sacrifice for Love or something. About a pretty girl falling in love with an office boy. I watched it just last week. When I still had a TV. Yati? Falling in love? She has a frozen heart. I know her boyfriend. He was killed by Colonel Demon... the colonel you saw just a moment ago... right in front of her eyes. And now... she allies herself... with the one who killed her boyfriend. What about these gloomy faces? Did you guys just watch a Turkish soap opera? Are you sad about being captured? Afraid of dying here? Go to hell, bootlicker! -Where was I? -Go to hell, bootlicker. Oh, yeah. This should not be your mournful day. Instead, it's a perfect day to celebrate someone's achievement. Thank you very much... Yati, for creating a serum named... A super serum? -What serum did you just say? -Super Human Mark A7. What serum is that? Super Human Mark A7. I'm getting tired of this. Come on, ask me the name again? What serum is that? So, you have the guts, kid? Go on, ask me again! I mean, what is it for? What is it for? I thought you were about to ask the name again. Super Human Mark A7 serum can give humans a super power... and make them... immortal. What a strange name. Like a sort of fertilizer. Super serum blah blah blah... He also said "mark" or something. Like "Mark Erot"! If it is Mark Erot, it will give super powers to the genitals only, not the human. Immortal genitals, huh? Anyone wants to discuss the name again? Go on, speak up! I'll wait. Go on. That serum is premature. No, Yati. This serum is perfect. It is perfect for international business. I don't even think... You're so mean, Yati. No, don't think that way, Deby. Yati just wants her boyfriend back. Her boyfriend? He died, no? The mightiest power in the world is the power of love. All people will do everything to reach for their love. What a lucky bastard. He was lucky that I spared his life. I kept him undead in life support... but not alive either. Thank you for your hard work and dedication. You're welcome, sir! Yati, you will be responsible for what happened to your beloved one. Show time. So, your boyfriend was a motorbike-taxi rider? You still have a chance, To. That's right, you look better than him. Much better. Thank you. Taru... It will be so much pleasure to strip your head and torture you! Go ahead, Ms. Deby. Try if you can. Wait! Wait! Chill out. No need to be savage like that. Give me a chance to fulfill my promise to Yati... and her beloved. Let them have the joy of meeting again. Aide. It's jammed, boss. It doesn't work. Hey, come back. Where are you going? What's my revenge for. Did that creature eat him? Awesome. You were tied, weren't you? No one tied me since the very beginning. So, why did you put your hands back? I just pretended for friendship. -You're crazy! -Untie me now! Oh, no. He saw me. Me! Spare me! -No, please. -No way. Let's make some noise! Danu, help me! -Danu! -What! Help me! -You must apologize first for lying to me! -Okay. I'm so sorry. Do it solemnly! -I apologize for lying to you. -I have your word? -Are you serious? -Yes! -Don't do it ever again! -All right! Damn, your breath stinks so bad! Let's move! Help me here! Dewi! Let's get out of here! Push the button! Close the door! Hey, this way! Hurry up! Don't panic! I'm working on it! Taru! Taru... This way. Hey! Get him! Have mercy, please! I'm just a subordinate carrying out my superior's order. Shut up! Finally we got you! Have you any bread? -Come on -Just finish him! Have mercy, sorry! I can give valuable information. No mercy for you. Let's kill him! No, please! I can tell you where the safe is. -Enough! -No. Hold on! What? The safe? So, you know where the safe is? Is there any money inside? Mercy, please! Okay! I can help you destroy this base! What do you mean? This base is equipped with mass destruction system, in case the police find it. Then? Just enter the activation code to blow the entire infrastructure and system of this base in a second. Only the colonel and I know the activation code. Explode? Your bodies will be blown to pieces? Gimme a break! See Yati's boyfriend? That virus must not get out of this place. Why do you turn against them? Because I know the colonel will kill us all after completing the mission. I've given all my life to him, but he will kill me after all. That's why sometimes I feel sad. Bullshit! Don't exaggerate! All right. Sorry. Okay! Do what you must! Don't be so rough. I'm not a bad guy. I used to be a policeman. But, I was not well-paid and I joined Colonel Demon. I didn't know that I would deal with zombies. Quiet! How long should I set for the countdown? Five minutes! Five minutes! You think it's a dangdut song, huh? It's too short for us to escape! Set it for an hour! A guy like you listens to Audi? Such a sissy man! Thirty minutes! Hey, 30 minutes is cool! Sounds like Jamrud's song, right? You're right. Hey, wait a sec! What about Yanto and Lilo? We can't stay here forever. We must get out. Dewi... I mean... Yati. Please, don't be sad. We'll make our way out of here. That's right. After all, our mission here is to save you. But, don't be hasty, To. Slow down, manage your energy. You act like racing against time bomb. Yanto, Lilo... Deby? The self-destruct system is about to be launched. This base will explode in 30 minutes. Listen! 30 minutes! Yati... Our business is not done yet. Stay alive! Did you really have to mention bombs? Can we order some food with that? Gimme a break! What are you doing? I'll press the button. This button is mine! -No, it's my turn! -No, it's mine! Hey, Yanto is there! Warning! Destruction in 30 minutes. Should they really start now? It's because you talked about bombs. But, I didn't expect this! It's okay for me to end up here. Dying with someone we love is... a bliss, right? Thank you for that. I also don't mind dying here with you. But, when did we make the everlasting covenant? It's not you, To! It's the man outside, her eternal love. Sorry, my friend is likely hallucinating. Move! Hey, turn back! Zombie! Too narrow here! -Please, let me. -No more space here! Colonel, the base has been penetrated. They broke away from the isolation room. They're gone. Check it out. It's safe. Let's go! Explosion in 25 minutes. Time to get out. They seem to be distracted by something. No. Wait! Don't do it. Are you sure we'll be safe now? As I observed, that serum paralyzes their logic. However, they're still under control of muscle memory. Such memory evokes a physiological reflex constructed upon their habit. That's why the zombies freeze upon hearing the alarm. Do you understand what she said? Nope. Okay, we get out on the next alarm. Okay. Deby-chan, it's my katana. Ain't there something to eat? Excuse me. No. Danu! Oh my! Run! Hurry! Danu, wait! Dedi, hurry up! Danu, Reva, wait! Why are they stopping? I'm tired of running. Let's just kill them all! You're right. What did he say? He's tired of running and is about to eradicate the zombies. -Let's do it now! -Now. You see? I've shot them but they stay alive. -Then, I'll slash them with my katana. -What? Just slash them with the katana. Try it yourself! -Deby-chan. -Deby. You're so beautiful. You're so beautiful. What are going to do after this? What are you going to do after this? Aw, aw! I'll finish them now! Go to hell! You go find the way out! I'm helping Reva here. How sweet! Right now! All right. Come on. Hurry! That's the exit! Okay. Let's go! Where are you going? Home. Me too, but we've got to wait for Reva and Deby. You're right. Now, how to tell them we're here? Wave a hand at them! -Wave a hand? -Yes. Here's a hand. Reva! Deby-chan, you're so cute. Thank you for helping me. My pleasure. Deby, Reva! -They've found the exit. -That's good. Take care. Die! Reva! -See something strange with the fingers? -Just a coincidence. -You sure? -Yes. You're right. -A coincidence, it says -Indeed. Hurry, get in! Deby, come on. Shoot it now! Now! Right on its head. Reva! I'm coming. -Aw, Aw! -Shut up! They keep coming! Close it! Now! What the hell is with this hand. -Let's move! -Come on. Show some respect! -Ded... -Go to hell! Let's get going. -Come on, move! -All right. Don't panic. Let's find another way. Back up! Don't panic! -I've got an idea! -What's that? Let's test that muscle memory theory. How? Poco-poco. -No soldier can't do Poco-poco, right? -That's right. Lilo, get over here! Who the hell is calling? -Hello -What? A woman's voice? -Where is Lilo? -Lilo is in the bathroom, Auntie. Bathroom? What have you done? Who's there? Jablay? I'm not jablay, Auntie. I am... Lilo's friend. Oh, my God, Lilo, you now start playing with jablay. It's a sin for 40 years, passed down through seven generations. Auntie, I've got to end this call, because... Lilo, No! Yanto, it's biting my ass! It's biting my ass, To! I'm gonna die. If you meet my mom later... please, tell her... I've never played with jablay. A denture? I am not dying! Let's get down quitely. Lilo! Let's just end this! -Calm down. -They are dancing, don't disturb! Demon! Let's go that way! That way? Hands up! Okay. Easy. My hands are up. I'll even take my hands off for what will happen to you. That one seems to be of a different variance. What do you mean? That's not Super Human Mark A7. That's A7S. -Sounds like a cell phone. -There must be Mark A7H after this one. -What's the difference? -We'll see ourselves in no time. It has never been tested before. You're indeed a great inventor. Hold on. No! He changed again. Lo, you must knock his head again. -Reva had his head struck again? -Yes! You're so troublesome! Can't you wait until the battle is done for this? -We've got to help them! -That's right! Not me! Hit him! Hey, don't hit me! That's my hand! My friend, Lilo, knocking me out won't hurt me. It will hurt you instead. Shut up! Ded, knock him on the front! Help me! Dedi... What a crazy frenzy! He can resist these guns. We need the bigger one. -I know where. -Let's waste no time, then! Why did you stop? -I forgot the way to get there. -No! Ma'am... -Do you know the way to the arsenal? -What? The arsenal! Yes, I do. Why? Take us there, please. Come on! Do we have to crawl like this? Do whatever you feel most comfortable with. No! -Nu! -What? -You can really do that? -Yes, as long as it's not for business. -Why didn't you do it earlier? -I've just discovered this. Okay, now I just need to keep the balance between inner energy and business. Come on, get me! Have mercy, please. Why do you always think about money? Hey you! Ducky Zombie! Enough. Yanto! Are you alright? -I'm fine. -Good. Where's Yati? On the way here. I don't know what all the fuss is about. There she is. -Is it over? -It is. Hey, help me! One, two... Fire in the hole! Taru! Fire, now! Yati, fire! Destruction in ten seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Hurry up! No explosion? Not like in the movies. Look at his face! It's now like in the movies, don't you think? Colonel! Who escaped? That was the colonel! What? The colonel's there. Thank you for the serum. That must be the aide! The serum must not fall into the wrong hands! That's pointless. It's because of you! What should we do, then? Don't let the outbreak happen. -Do you want me to call the headmaster? -Why ask me? So that you can decide to return or not. I'll return. Taxi, anyone? -So, you looted thesse things, huh? -Watch your language. -Correction, secured the evidence. -Yeah, at least I got a TV, so that I can go home. You know my family, right? You're lucky... to have a family... waiting for you at home. A moment, please. Aw, aw! Go get her, tiger! See you in the office. Or maybe somewhere else. Who's that? -That must be Eva Arnas, bro. -No, that's Kiki Fatmala. Betharia Sonata. -Nike Ardila, I suppose. -Or Meriam Bellina? -Sophia Latjuba! -Is it so? Who are they? They are... The five heroes. -Assemble the others! -Yes, ma'am. Let's jet! -Hello? -Everyone, HQ is waiting. -Okay, baby. -Okay. Hey, honey. Astaghfirullah hal adzim, I'm so sorry.
