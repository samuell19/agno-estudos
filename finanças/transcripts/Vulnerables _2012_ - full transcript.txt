Thanks for letting me record, doctor. Sure there's no interference? - It won't harm the baby, right? - Don't worry, it's OK. Now we'll listen to her heartbeat. Is everything OK? Hi, Lucia, honey! Look! I've just seen you. You're already beautiful! You're really big! Mom's belly is growing so much! See? You have two hands and all your tiny fingers... And, most of all, you're healthy. Hey, Nacho! Say something to my baby Lucia, please. Lucia, babe. Mom doesn't know what she's doing. She went to a sperm bank, when she had so much fun with me. Listen, sleeping with you was a mistake. A big mistake! - Pregnancy makes you so sexy!- You goose! Lucia, come with me. I'll introduce you to some of your mom's friends. Hey, Sonia! Paco! - Paco, say something nice to Lucia. - Hi, Lucia. Your mom's crazy. She's an obsessive neurotic control freak. Move away! Your mom's the best in the world although she doesn't want to be a part of it. You'll find out anyway, so I'll tell you: Your mom... is perfect. She's strong, independent... Very independent. She gets a dough making websites. You got a lot to learn from her. I just hope you teach her what "love" and "affection" mean - and she becomes a little sweeter! - Give it to me. Don't be silly! Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you! Happy birthday from me and Lucia! Happy birthday to you! - You fool!- Hi, honey! - You did remember! - How could I forget when you're putting upwith me through my pregnancy? Only through your pregnancy? I'll send you the bill! - Carla, are you OK?- No! - What's wrong?- I don't know! I need a gurney! - Calm down!- What's wrong? It hurts so much, Sonia! - What's wrong? - They're here! Calm down! Don't move! Everything's gonna be OK. One, two, three! Calm down! The reports! They're in my purse! Make way, please! Calm down, Carla. - Make way, please! - We're almost there, honey. It's OK. Everything's fine. We're there. Calm down. Now, turn around. OK, quick! - What happened?- I don't know. It hurts so much! Put her an IV, please! Come on, take her vital signs. How many months are you pregnant? - Six months, almost seven. - Have you ever had a miscarriage - or a premature labor?- No, nothing! - Book an OR! It's an emergency! - I'll take her personal belongings. Take the purse away. Yes, they're in my purse. Let me see those reports. Call the Neonatal Unit immediately! My baby... Where's Lucia? - Where is she? - Don't cry, honey. - Where's Lucia? - In the Neonatal Unit, she's too weak. - Is she OK? - She's alive. Now we have to wait. - I wanna see my baby! - You can't see her now. I wanna see my baby! I gotta go and see her! Here, take this. It'll calm you down. Please... Please, may she be OK. I'm only allowed to see her twice a day, Sonia. They won't tell me how she is. I don't know anything. She's stable and that's the most important thing. Don't worry. She just has to grow up and become a strong and healthy baby. And you gotta go to your room and get well. Come on. THREE MONTHS LATER Hi, Sonia! I'm driving now, I'm about to arrive. I think so, but you know what doctors are like. Yes. I'll call you if I need anything. Don't worry. I'm taking everything with me, in case I can take her home. OK. Yes, I'll use my speakerphone. OK. Thanks. Bye. Well, it seems the risk is over. The baby has gained weight and her lungs grew bigger. But they suffered a lot and they're weaker than those of a normal child. In fact, she might have asthma attacks. If so, give her this aerosol. Anyway, especially to avoid future complications, I'd recommend you to get away from the city pollution a few months. Some clean air and a dry climatewould be good for her. Are you telling me to take my baby out of Madrid? You should consider that possibility. It's just a preventive measure. In certain cases, there's the risk that she contracts a chronic breathing disease. Can you count on her father's help? - No, I'm a single mother. Why? - No reason. I was just meaning you'll need some help. But you can rely on your family. Grandparents are always a great help. Sure. Thanks, doctor. You're discharging my baby today, aren't you? It's OK, honey. We're going home now. It's OK, Lucia. Paco, I need you to call the client and ask him to wait. I'm going to deliver a bit over the deadline. What can I do, Paco? With my baby at the hospital, I didn't have much time and now she's at home, I have even less! Come on. Go on with your part and I'll send you mine as soon as I finish it. OK, bye. Good morning, may I speak to Marcial, please? Oh! And do you know where...? Hello? Don't hang up, please. I'm Manuel de Corral's daughter. I need to talk to Marcial urgently. It's really important. Yeah, you've already told me he doesn't live there, but could you give him my phone number if you see him? Write it down, please. Go ahead! You asshole! Hello! Marcial! Hi, how are you? It's Carla, Manuel de Corral's daughter. Oh, you're his son! Yes, of course I remember. Well, I wanted to spend a few days at my father's country house and... I wanted to know about its condition. Yeah, I know it's been a long time. I'm sorry you couldn't get hold of me during all these years. Is the house ready to move in? I'm taking a baby with me. If it's a problem, I could go to a hotel instead. I was just leaving. Don't worry, Marcial. We'll sort all that as we go along. I'll see you there, then. Thanks. I'm not crazy, Paco. I have no choice but to leave. Yeah, honey. But what am I supposed to tell him? I'll be more relaxed in the country and I'll get up to date, I promise. - Yeah, sure! - Just hold him back a little. Damn! It's not a drama if an architecture studio website isn't ready on time! - Nobody's gonna die!- Hey! What's up with you? You don't sound like yourself! - Come on, Paco, call him.- OK. And I'll send you my designs as soon as they're finished. - OK.- Alright, then. - Bye.- Kisses. - Carla, right? - Hi, Marcial? Marcial, I'm sorry about the short notice. And I'm sorry I had nothing to do with the house all these years... No, don't you worry. What I said before... This is all very sudden. Please, let me help you, ma'am. Call me Carla. Don't worry. I can manage, Marcial. I can manage, thank you. I told you I could manage, but thank you. I only had time to get the important stuff ready. I cleaned up the kitchen, the bathrooms, the rooms... I prepared your parents' old room for you. The first one on the left. - Here? - Yes. Where did you get this cradle? I found it in the warehouse. I imagined it was yours - and I thought maybe... - Thank you. Lucia? Lucia! Lucia! - What's wrong? - Lucia is not here! Marcos! Marcos! Let go! It's OK. It's OK, love. It's OK, honey. Marcos, say sorry. I'm sorry, but I was only playing with her! It's OK, Marcos, but I got really scared. I don't want you near the baby's stroller again. I said I'm sorry! Is he your son, Marcial? Yeah. I'll take the rest of your bags in. You have such beautiful hair, Marcos. Your mommy must be really pretty. My mother is dead. - I'm sorry, I messed up with Marcos. - No, it's OK. Sometimes, Marcos... behaves in a little special way. I mentioned his mom... and he told me she's dead. He was a great man. This farm was the heart of this region. These were the best lands. We all lost a lot when he died. I hardly knew about this part of his life. He used to come here often, but my mom and I stopped coming. I can hardly remember it. You didn't remember me. This must be your father. Is he still alive? Yeah... But he's very old now and... he's not very well. I remember my father used to talk a lot about him. - Also, he built this house, right? - Yeah... And it hurt him bad when the farm was abandoned. Marcial... I was 13 when my parents died on their way back from here. They were my only family. When I left the orphanage, this was the last place I wanted to go back to. I guess that was my way to forget. So why are you here now? Because of Lucia. She was a preemie and her doctor told me to take her out of the city. So I'm thinking of staying here for some time. Well, it's working now. I left food here for tonight. It's not much, but maybe God sent you two to bring prosperity back to the farm. - Who knows...- Well, call me if you need anything. - Who knows...- Well, call me if you need anything. - I'll be back tomorrow morning. - Thanks. Marcos, let's go home! How nice! Lucia is taking a bath! There's water here! Marcial? Marcial? Hello? Who's there? Damn! God! We woke you up. Sorry. It's almost nine o'clock. - You do start early. - We wake up with the sun. - Don't we, Marcos?- Well, I haven't slept very well. But Lucia slept all night long. It's incredible. - Good. - My grandfather made this. It looks great! Thank your grandfather. Lucia can't eat this, so you'll have to help me eat it. - I'll make some coffee, OK?- Thanks. - I'm sorry, I don't have any. - This grows in your farm. And this, in the village store. I must go there to fill my empty fridge! Thanks. Marcial, the heater doesn't work either. How can it be? There must be something wrong. I didn't touch anything. - Magic! - OK. Since this farm closed down and... and my father got ill... I guard this land, keep up the basic stuff and get a little benefit from it in return. Now we only get enough for us and to sell a bit at the market. - I'm gonna ride my bike in the patio. - Wait! Ask Carla for permission. This is her house. - Can I? - Of course, Marcos. Listen, Marcial, this may be an uncomfortable question... What happened to Marcos' mom? His mother was from Romania. We met working in the vineyards and we fell in love. She got pregnant and she moved in with me. One day, we found her dead while we were grape picking. Marcos was four. I'm sorry. It must have been hard for you to raise him on your own. I did my best, but he needs a mother. Can I take Lucia for a stroll? - Yeah. - No. Sure! See if you can get her to sleep. - Stay where we can see you, OK?- OK. So what should we do to make the farm work again? Do you think it's possible to make a living out of it again? I wouldn't know where to start... We could lease a couple of warehouses. Water is the main thing. We should fix the irrigation and farm the land. - Marcos! - Marcos, stop! I know what you're thinking, but I didn't do anything! Don't worry. Maybe she got scared when she couldn't see me. Come with mommy. Marcos, help me pick up the dead leaves in the porch. I didn't do anything! She's a crybaby! Marcos! Look out! Be careful! Look, Lucia, honey. This is all ours. Beautiful, isn't it? Maybe you'd like to live here one day, just like when mommy was a child. Marcos? Marcos! CARLA AND MARCIAL, I worked all night on what you told me yesterday. This is a plan to set everything off again. - Marcial, you shouldn't... - Apart from plowing the fields, the irrigation system goes first. We should take it out and fix the leaks. That'd take us about a month and a half. In three months, everything's ready. Thank you, but you shouldn't have listened to me. I got carried away by my imagination yesterday. I won't be able to pay you. It's a lot of work. We could be partners. You put the land and I put my work. What do you say? Get on the tractor! We'll do the first furrows! Come on! - What about Lucia? - She'll be OK! You'll keep her in sight! We'll be right here! Marcos, get on the tractor! Come on! I know you're very independent, like when you were a child, but you don't need to care about anything. You can go back to Madrid whenever you want, I can manage. I'd send you the money. Carla, I'm doing this to honor my father and to re-create what was once so important for me and my family. To give my son a future. Partners. You won't regret it. What would you like? - I'd like a quarter kilo of cheese. - OK. You're Carla de Corral, right? Excuse me? I knew your father very well. He was a very nice person. I see he left his mark on this village. He did indeed! Since he died, nothing's the same around here. Are you taking charge of the farm? If I were you, I'd get things straight with Marcial and his son. Since that story with the Romanian woman, they've been living poorly. It might have been hard for them. Poor kid. Poor kid? That's not what people say. Before he was expelled from school, he was in class with my cousin's eldest son. he was in class with my cousin's eldest son. Well, he beat up one of his classmates just because he took his bike for a ride. And then, there's his grandmother. That poor woman couldn't get anywhere with him, They found her drowned in the river. Nobody knows what happened to her. - Anything else? - No. How much is it, please? It's OK, I can put it on your account. You'll come round again, right? - Yes. - It's OK, then. See you. - Good morning! May I help you? - Hi, I'd like some pajamas for my baby. Isn't she lovely! Look! These are very beautiful! - I'm taking those three. - It's 18 euros, then! - You're not from here, are you? - No. So, are you spending the day? Yes, we're spending a few days in El Alambique. Oh, I didn't know they rented it out. Especially with those two around! Look, that little boy is a devil! Be careful if you see him. Well, beautiful, come back some day and we'll find something for you! Thanks. You don't want help, do you? No, thanks. Come on, dad! Let's go! Marcos! Good morning! Hi, Carla! It's enough, Marcos! Why don't you leave us alone? - Carla! What's wrong? - I swear I didn't do anything! Tell this looney to let me go! You're crazy! You didn't do anything? Come here! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, GET OUT OF HERE - What's this then? - I didn't do it! I swear to my mother! - Don't lie! I heard your bike! - All children have bikes! - Marcos was with me all night. - You're lying! Who did this, then? You want my dad and my house just for you! - Get the lime from the warehouse. - I didn't do it, dad! I know sometimes Marcos doesn't behave like a normal kid. When his mother died, he became moody and I took him to a doctor in Ciudad Real. He just stuffed him with pills. After two weeks, he was a zombie. I stopped giving him those drugs. I gave up working the land, we started to spend some time here and he's been calm since then. Maybe he's a little upset because you are here. But I'm sure if he says he didn't do it, it's true! - Who did this, then? - I don't know! I bet it was someone from the village! They never accepted that I had a child with an immigrant! Since then, they make life difficult for us. We had to move out of the village! They must know you're here and they want to compromise us. Sonia! Hi! I'm fine, yeah. Yes, Lucia is very well, too. Hey, I wanted to ask you a question. What could happen to a kid who's really moody and behaves strangely? I don't know, strangely... Sometimes, he's lovely. Sometimes, he has this scary look... He must have a problem, cause he's been under treatment. I know it's not much information, but I need you to tell me something. Deficit... of attention. Bipolar disorder. No, it's for a friend's child. What do you mean, which friend? Of course I can make friends! Don't be silly. I'll tell you later. Don't worry. Thanks. Bye. BIPOLAR DISORDER ...MOOD CHANGES EUPHORIA AND IRRITABILITY... ...DIFFICULT DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT... ...YEARS TO FIND A CORRECT DIAGNOSIS... ...BIPOLARITY AND MULTIPLE PERSONALITY... MULTIPLE PERSONALITY Between the psychological and the supernatural, we find the old legend of the Doppelgänger, in German, he who walks by your side. An old legend about a ghostly double or an evil twin of a living person. It's said that finding your Doppelgänger is an omen of your own death. - Yes?- It's Marcial! Just a second! Hi. I'm sorry. Did I interrupt you? Were you busy? No, come in. I wasn't doing anything. I just wanted to tell you the irrigation is working in the big field. Oh, thanks. Marcial, I wanted to talk to you. Is Marcos around? No, I took him to his grandfather. I wanted him to calm down, after this morning... Marcial, I know you don't wanna believe me, but Marcos comes here at night. I've heard his bike. I'm sure he just wants to scare us away, - but I'm afraid he might hurt Lucia... - Carla, that's not possible! He sleeps right by my side. He can't go out without me noticing. What was his diagnosis? Bipolar disorder? 44% of the cases are diagnosed late or mistakenly. - Many years could pass before... - No! Marcial, I recorded something last night and I'm sure it's Marcos. I want you to see it. Carla, calm down, please! I understand your concern about Lucia better than anyone. Of course! But Marcos is OK. He'd never hurt any of you, believe me. First, because I'd never allow that to happen. Never. Let´s go little by little. Where's the kid, dad? Hi, Carla! - Did you sleep well last night? - Much better, thanks. Marcos is helping me clean up the pipes in the big field today, right? Sure, dad! And you should also fix the swimming pool. If Lucia and Carla are staying for the summer, they could use it! OK. Let's do it, then! Do you wanna have breakfast before you go? Yeah! Thank you very much. Marcos, come here! Ask Carla for water. Carla! Dad wants some fresh water. It's really hot outside! Yes, Marcos. It's in the fridge. Thanks! Bye! Put this in the shade. - Give me a kiss. - Hello! - You look good! - How are you? What a surprise. What are you doing here? Can't your best friend come and visit you? Of course. That must be your friend, right? How is Lucia doing? She is much better since we are here. Hi! My name is Marcos. Nice to meet you. Ah!, what a handsome gentleman! Marcos! Don´t badger, come! No, Marcial, please join us! Let me introduce you to Sonia. She's my best friend. I'm sorry about my looks. Pleasure. What about having lunch all together? Uh, like this? You can get a shower at home, and I have some old clothes. In the meanwhile we'll get the food ready. Shall you give us a hand, Marcos? Of course!. After you ma'am! Hey, you do it very well! Did domeone taught you? Yes, my dad. You must love him a lot. Do you two get along well? - Yes - Good! And you..., why are you here? I am very good friends with Carla, and I wanted to pay her a visit. Do you have many friends? Yes, all the kids in town. I'm going to bring these clothes to Marcial And, apart from your dad, do you have any other family? - Yes, Grampa. - How is he like? I don't know, like any other grandpa. He teaches me stuff, we play together, and I love him a lot. That's great! Why is Carla taking so long? She must be taking care of the house, don't worry. Carla and Lucia are great, do you have fun with them? Yes. But Lucia cries a lot, and that sometimes bothers me. That's normal, Marcos. She is a baby! - Dad? - Marcos, go to the kitchen! You are taking too long! Come on marcos, set the table. After you! Then, my father told me: Son, while I am alive there won't be a single weed here. Since then, whether Marcos or I rake that patio every morning. It seems you didn't fulfill your promise, look at the one that just came up! Well, Marcos it's time to get back to work. Let's go! It's been a pleasure. I rest assured that my friend is in the best hands. And this gentleman, take good care of my girls. Come on, lead the way. Hey, what's going on with Marcial? Just worry about the kid! What do you think? Honestly, I couldn't confirm any symptoms, he seems like a perfectly normal kid. Bastard, he is faking it! Please Carla, you have put up this show to be able to get my opinion. I have talked to him for hours. A kid couldn't pretend that well. How naive! I hope at the hospital you diagnose better! Thank you for coming, Sonia. Marcial! I'm going to the village to buy milk for the baby. I can't stop this now, but I could buy it for you tomorrow. It's OK, I need it for tonight. I'll be right back! What's wrong? I don't know. I'll do it. I can't see anything wrong. I'll check it for you tomorrow! I have to finish with the chemicals and fill up the swimming pool! May I borrow your motorbike, Marcial? - What about the baby? - She can stay here with you. She'll be safe with you, won't she? OK, if it's so urgent... - Thanks.- Can you ride a motorbike? - Hi. - I knew you'd come back! - How's the house going? - Very well. I met Marcial and his son. They're really nice. Do you reckon? You just don't know them well! I'd like to give them a surprise. Do you know where they live? What are you talking about? They live in a hovel! Well, it's up to you! As you drive off the village, - take the dirt road, it's straight on. - Thanks. Hi. You must be Marcial's father. I'm Carla, Manuel de Corral's daughter. I'm so sorry the farm was closed down. I know it was really important to you. I really respect your son and your grandson. I spend a lot of time with Marcos and I'm worried about him. I think Marcos has a psychological problem. I need your help to persuade Marcial to take him to Madrid for treatment. Hey! DIAGNOSIS FORM ...SEEMS TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE. WOULD RATHER BE DEAD... ...BIPOLAR DISORDER... Poor kid? Well, he beat up one of his classmates... And then, there's his grandmother. They found her drowned in the river. Look, that little boy is a devil! That kid is the demon. Did you bring the milk? They run out of it, but I'll manage. - What happened? - Leave me alone! I can't! What's going on? I'm worried about you! - Is it for the lands? - No way! It's Marcos! Forget it, please! You're getting obsessed! Why didn't you tell me he was with his mother when she died? And what about his grandmother? What happened to her? How did she die? Your father showed me Marcos' reports and his drawings. Even his own grandfather says he's the demon! My father? Did you go to my house without telling me? - You're out of your mind! - That's you and your son! Marcos needs medical treatment before he hurts someone else. And you're crazy if you think you can keep him under guard here forever! I'd better go now. We'll talk when you're calmed. Yeah, go! I don't want to put my baby at risk! You're being irresponsible and I don't wanna be your accomplice! Just go! Carla! Dad wants some fresh water. It's really hot outside! Yes, Marcos. It's in the fridge. Thanks! Mine... Mine... Lucia! Marcos, leave her alone! Come here, my love! I told you to leave! Get out of here! Rock-a-bye baby, in the tree top. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. And down will come baby, cradle and all. - Marcos, let me out!- No, it's too late. Marcos, Marcos... I'm not Marcos. I think Marcos has a psychological problem. You're dead! You can't escape. Carla! Carla! May I take Lucia for a stroll? Of course, I can get her to sleep... May I take Lucia for a stroll? Of course, I can get her to sleep... for good! Marcial! Marcial? Get off! Let me go! Marcos? Where's Marcos? Marcos! Marcos! God! No! No! No! He was a demon! He wanted to kill Lucia and me! I've got it here. I've got it all here. Carla! Dad wants some fresh water. It's really hot outside! Yes, Marcos. It's in the fridge. Thanks! It's not possible! It's not possible! It's not possible! I am worried about you! You're getting obsessed! Tell this looney to let me go! You're crazy! No!
