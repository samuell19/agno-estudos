RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM The caterers are sets. I've just confirmed the string quartet and everything else you need to know is in here. Alphabetized and color-coded. There shouldn't be any surprises. - It's black-tie formal. - Just like the last three years. Well... Not too repetitive, I hope? Its... its' more of a... Christmas classic. It's always a huge success, so I'm not worried. Although, you've always been here to handle everything in person. I know, I'm sorry. This is the first Christmas that my parents have been away and my sister really... Go. Don't worry. You've done all the heavy lifting. And if we need anything, we can always ask Trey. Go. Before I change my mind. Right. Going. I'm just wondering, is there... any news on the promotion front? I'm sorry, not yet. They promised to let me know before you took of, but so far nothing. It's okay, I get it, everyone's busy with the holidays. - Just keep your phone close. - I always do. And I'll call you as soon as I hear. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Okay, before you say anything, I'm almost there. Hey, it's a Christmas miracle! Didn't think they'd ever let you escape. Careful. There's still time. Okay, how many times has mom called you so far? Four times, just from the airport. And twice when they got to Hawaii. I'm so happy they went, though. I can't remember the last time they went somewhere, just the two of them. Dad said it was before you guys adopted me. Is that true? You mean back when life was peaceful? Oh, please. No, I'm really glad you decided to spend Christmas - with me and Tim's family this year. - I know. I'm so excited, too. Plus, you said the magic words. You-know-who won't be there. Well... Okay, I'm super excited you're coming. Yeah. I just have to quickly stop for gas and I will be right there. - Okay! See you soon. Love you! - Love you! - Hi! - Hey! Let me help you with that. Oh, my goodness. Wow. Hi! - Hi, Tim. - Hey. Thank you so much for having me! You're so welcome. Well, I'm very excited for my first Barnett Christmas. Me too. Well, my first as a Barnett. Okay, you two... Sorry. Sorry. Why don't I take these inside and then I'll send Paul out to grab the rest of the stuff. This is... all of it, right? Yeah. This is all of it. Did you just... say Paul? - Yeah. - He's here? - You know my brother. - Not really. You never know where his vacation's gonna end up until you get the postcard. I mean, that's Paul. Okay. I'm gonna take these inside. Nice and light. Thank you! Okay, before you say anything, it's just for one night. Why didn't you tell me? It was super last minute and I didn't want to give you an excuse to turn around and go back to work. They do not get another holiday out of you. I'm sorry, but is it really that big a deal? I know he was a bit... blunt at the wedding, but... That's an understatement. A big one. He's still going on his ski trip. To Switzerland? He's just leaving in the morning now. In the morning. Okay. You know what? It's fine. It's fine. So, you won't say anything? You don't have to worry about me. I can handle anything. For a night. You're gonna love it here. Judy said you're just upstairs. - It's cold. - Let me grab your bag. You weren't kidding. This is beautiful. Oh yeah, gorgeous. This is their vacation home? Yeah, I know, right? Come one! Well, I should probably take these off. I've got... snow everywhere. I am so... sorry. Are you okay? - I... - Yeah, I am fine. I'm... I'm fine. You made it. Yup. I did. Man, I hope it didn't take you as long to get here as it took me. I mean, getting out of the city was brutal. Am I right? What am I doing? Let me get your bags. No. No, I'm good. No? No. Okay. Well, how 'bout your pillow? - I got it. - Hey! Hi. You remember my sister? From the wedding? Of course. How could I forget our chicken dance, huh? Well, it was a group dance, wasn't "ours". Okay. Good clarification. You made it! And in good time, too. Hi! Thank you so much for having me. - Thank you for coming! - Can I take those? Bring them upstairs? Yeah. That would be wonderful. - Alright. - Thanks. Thanks! - You must be starving. Come on in! - I am. As much as I hate you missing Christmas, I know it's the only time you can get away from work. I know. Thank you, mom. - You should be an accountant. - Why? You know your brother. He's not really one for, you know, sitting still. I don't wanna sit still. There's a whole big world out there just ready to be seen. And I want to see it. I'm just saying you get a lot more time off as an accountant as you do as a building contractor. Would you like anything else, Hayley? - You haven't really touched... - No! I'm good. Everything was so delicious. I just ate too much granola on the way up here. Hey, I was gonna ask... where's that boyfriend of yours? I'm sorry? Simon, wasn't it? Nice British fellow. We had a good "chinwag" at the wedding. I think that's what they call it. Chinwag. Well, I'm guessing he's back home in London. I can't be so sure. Why's that? Because... not together anymore? No. No. Not. We actually broke up shortly after the wedding. You did? - Yeah. - Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Don't be. It's okay. It's all good. - Okay! Who wants dessert? - I'll help you! - It's just for one night. - Yup. Okay, now... don't worry, it doesn't need to be fancy. Just has to come from the heart. - We're making gifts? - A gift. One each. Everyone will take a name and... I guess whoever gets Paul - will have to make something real quick. - Wait. Where is Paul? Is that mom again? No, actually, it's work. I... - Take it outside. - What? - The reception's better out there, okay? - Okay. Kim! Hi. You're breaking up. Can you hear me? Kim? Hello? Can you hear me now? Your reception's not great. And so far, no news. Well, I guess that's better than bad news, right? They're now saying they don't want to make the decision until after the event on the 23rd. Okay. Speaking of... how do you feel about circus performers? Trey's old idea? The one we all shot down? Well, personally, I wouldn't hire them to serve and I'm not a fan of last-second changes, but if it's shock value you're after... Hayley, everyone here loves the idea. You've already decided. Well, I guess, just keep me posted, then. Of course, I will. Yeah. Well, you know where to find me. Bye. Bye. Terrific. You drop the call? Happens a lot out here. You know, sometimes there's better service in the driveway if you want to try it. - I'm fine. - Did you try to shake it? What? Your phone. It helps. I'm kidding. It's a joke. Okay. It might... Did I do something? Is that a question or another joke? Question. You know, it's really not a great time to ask. Come on! Fine. You really wanna know? I do. You had no right dooming my relationship. Excuse me? Do you not remember what you said? At the wedding? Oh no, I do. But all I said was that your boyfriend was clearly going to move back to London. Yeah. Without me! Who says that to someone? At a wedding? It was just an observation. Yeah. An observation which forced a conversation. A conversation, without which, who knows? Might've worked out differently. Why are you laughing? I'm sorry. Sorry. You actually blame me for your breakup? What? No. No. I... You wanted to know if you did anything and I just told you, okay? Great. Great. Well, then, can I make one more observation? - No. You may not. - No? - No. - No? - No. - Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I must. I must! If your relationship ended because of one conversation... it wasn't gonna work in the first place! Is that your expert opinion? Yeah. Well, that's... I'm sorry. I find that actually really funny because I've heard that you're not quite an expert in the relationship department yourself. You're too busy! You're always traveling. You're Paul "Who Can't Sit Still". What does that have to do with anything? Nothing. I'm just saying I'm not surprised. What? That I don't have a girlfriend? Word of advice... observations aren't always helpful. Or wanted. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you for that... "observation". - Anything else? - No. I think we're good. - Good. - Good. - Good! - Good. What am I supposed to do with an... oven mitt? Embellish. You could make it a fancy chapeau. Okay! It's time to pick names! Hayley, as our guest, you go first. Okay. Yeah. So, how'd it go? You mean out there, right now? - Yeah. - With your work call? Oh, that? It was... it's not great. I mean, it was... yeah. Not great. What'd the airline say? They're not letting anybody out. Out? What do you... what do you mean "out"? Well, turns out there's a big snow storm in Northern Europe, so... next flight out isn't until Christmas Day. Does this mean you're staying?! For like... five more days? Apparently. - You just made my Christmas! - That makes two of us. Here you go. Now you've got towels, water... And these super cute jammies. Thank you. It's nothing. They were on sale. I get them for all the kids every Christmas. Whether they like it or not. Are you sure you don't want me to sleep on the couch? I honestly don't mind. Oh, please! Paul insisted you have his room. - He did? - He wasn't even supposed to be here. Yeah. That's right. Well, thank you. Just let me know if you need anything. Goodnight! Goodnight! He's been everywhere. Did you really say something? Cute jammies. Did you? What? It... It wasn't that bad. What did you say? Just that he had no right commenting on my relationship. I actually think it was a really good thing for him to hear. Good? Good how? From a personal-development standpoint? In fact, I think it actually might help him in his future relationships. I'm sure he was very appreciative. Hayley! I'm sorry, okay? I thought he was leaving. And then... the words just kind of came out. - After that circus call. - You mean with work? I had everything set up, down to every little detail and then... It doesn't matter because I'm not there, so they hire someone else... It will not be because you took a break. You deserve this promotion, Hayle. You know that. You've been there forever and if they don't promote you, just... Just quit. You could go anywhere. - It's not that easy. - Why not? Because I've been there forever. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. I know you wanted this weekend to be perfect. It's fine. Maybe even better you got it off your chest? I know you're lying. But I appreciate it. Just get a good night's sleep, okay? I plan on sleeping in as late as humanly possible tomorrow. Good. - I love you. - I love you more. Okay, fine. Fine. I'm up. Good morning. I can't believe everybody's actually up. Yeah. You didn't you know? We're all real early risers here, especially Paul. I had no idea. You still clocked a good eight, right? Smoothie? No. I'm... I'm good with... - Coffee. - Yes. Your second cup is standing by. So, Hayley, how much time do you need to get ready? Ready? For what? Well, if you want to know what's happening, it's right over there. - We're going ice skating? - For a start. Well... I'm not the best ice skater. So I'm just gonna hang here and you guys can go. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. - Excuse me? - Yeah, our mom has a strict no-man-left-behind policy at Christmas, so... Well, she likes us all together, all week. It's what makes the holidays special. Otherwise it's just a lot of stuff we do. - That's right, mom. - Right? Yeah. You know I love it. So what are we thinking? Can we all be ready in ten? - Ten. - Yeah. - Yep. - Ready in ten? All right. - Refill? - Well, this is relaxing. Just... think of all the fresh air we're gonna get. Yeah. Bless you. - Here, this'll warm you up. - Thank you, honey. I'm fine! You go on. No. That's the last thing they need; the old man showing them up. - Looking good, Hales! - Thanks! I was just thinking the same thing. Alright. So, I think I already know the answer, but are you sure you don't want any help? Positive. Just one piece of advice... don't look at your feet. It sounds counterintuitive, but trust me. It'll make it a lot easier. Okay. I'm fine! Are you always this stubborn? Stubbornness has nothing to do with this. Okay, okay, okay. You're right. I'm sorry. I probably should've found a better time to comment on your boyfriend than at the wedding. Thank you. But you really should have seen it coming. Excuse me? Well, I mean, look, I know he was your type and all. And I get it. I do. But if I could see the handwriting on the wall in just a weekend... And how exactly do you know what my type is? Easy. What? - You're a creature of habit. - No! No, I am not. You sure about that? You have two cups of coffee. Every morning. So does every other person on planet Earth. I'm pretty sure you take trail mix with you everywhere you go. Well, I don't like to be hungry. And, besides, it's granola. You travel... with your own pillow? You clearly have a thing for guys with accents. I'm guessing... mostly British? - What?! - Safe, predictable, suit-wearing men with British accents. Are those bad things? They're not bad. If they're working for you. Okay, can you... can you give me a little space, please? You want me to leave? Yeah. I do. You know, actually, I think it would probably be in everyone's best interest if you and I give each other space the entire week. Tricky, considering my mom's policy, and all. And the fact that we're staying in the same house. But, you know, I think there's enough of us, we could probably figure out some sort of... buffer. Great. - Good. - Good. I'm just going to start making the cookie dough. - Honey, you need to lie down. - It's almost Christmas! We have to finish decorating upstairs, we've a ton of desserts to make, a tree to get... Not to mention the charity event. I haven't even checked in on the decorations or the food for that. Well, I already finished the sleigh for the donations, so you don't have to worry about that, mom. It really is beautiful. Thank you. Now, please, would you just get a... short nap? No, I'm fine. Well, you're right. The reception is definitely better out there, but... still no updates. - What's wrong? - Judy's not feeling so great. - Oh no, really? - Oh, it's nothing. I'll be fine after a quick... mom? What was I saying? Okay, that's it. Time for bed! - This can't be happening. - Come on. What am I gonna do? Well, not worry about Christmas for starters. We'll take care of everything while you rest, mom. Yeah. Well, what about the charity gala? If anything comes up, we're all here to help with that, too. - Come on. - You know, - I don't think this looks that bad. - That's not her list. Behind you. Don't worry. Christmas'll be perfect. I promise. Listen to the kids. They got this. They'll do everything together, just like we do every year. Will you take a lot of photos? And still make your gifts? Yes, mama. - And you... - No! Bed time. We'll get you some tea. Well... So much for a buffer. I still don't know what I'm supposed to do with an empty CD case. Dude, your wife's an art teacher. You know that, right? - It's not rubbin' off. - I don't know. What about that time you made me... never mind. Okay, so I have taken all of your mom's lists and I've combined them and made one massive spreadsheet so we know exactly what we need to do for the rest of the week. - There you go. - Thank you. And one for you. Are you always this organized? - Yes! - Yes. She used to tidy up my toys. When she was four. I was thinking for the more functional items, we can divide and conquer? Girls against boys. So, is this your new buffer? I just wanted us to get on the same page and now each of us have our own page. Okay, so let's look at today. December 21st... We're going to go pick up the food and you guys can go upstairs and finish the decorating. - Sound good? Great. - Seems fair. I can't believe I thought mom was over the top for making us camp out in front of the Christmas tree every year. Tim's mother is officially next level. I think it's actually pretty mild in comparison. To what? You think Judy's chart is too much? Their grandma used to map out all twelve days of Christmas. For everyone. What? What's wrong? Nothing. I... I'm fine. Might just be the smell of the blue cheese or... the camembert. Oh no... No, no, no! Please! You can't be getting sick, too. You can't go down and leave me alone with Paul. Why are you looking at me like that? Wait! Wait, you're not. Are you seriously pregnant? Okay, okay. Alright, I'll keep it down. But what? I know. It's still early, so we're not telling anyone. Not 'til Christmas. So, that's why Tim was acting so weird? Well, he's a bit cautious, anyways. In general. That is true. But he doesn't want anyone to know yet. Not even you. - Okay. - Not 'til we tell his parents. I don't know how I'm going to tell them. I mean, Judy is so good at making everything special and... I... Hey. You're going to be an amazing mom. I hope so. You will. I'm so happy for you! Thank you. Why don't we just call Paul? He's got that big truck. He can pull us out in, like, a second. No. No, no. I got this, okay? No need for Paul. Okay. I think we're good. So sorry. I don't know why I'm so exhausted. I feel like all I do is sleep all the time. Hey! Don't apologize. You just need to lay down and I will cover for you. Okay? I'm sorry. I know you're not a big fan of Paul's. Stop apologizing. It's fine. We will do anything we need to do. And I promise... I will act like I know nothing. Hey there, Tim! - Hey. - Hi. She knows, doesn't she? - What? - It's okay! I mean, she's your sister and your best friend, of course she knows. Sorry, I tried. And for the record... you both have terrible poker faces. Hey. Hey. Thought I heard you guys come in. Yeah, about that. They're not feeling that good. Amy, especially, so they're just gonna take it easy. And considering your dad is taking care of your mom, that means it's just... It's just the two us. For the moment. Yeah. But, we do need to get a Christmas tree tomorrow at some point. Tut-tut-tut. Let me guess; divide and conquer? Well, unfortunately, if we want to pick a tree that meets your mom's expectations, it's probably going to take at least two people. You mean... you... want to do this together? You and me? Well, 'cause you need my help, I... Need is a strong word, but, yeah. I guess so. Okay. Well, look, I just need you to know... you see, my mother? Now she's going to require a lot of photos. Lots of pictures. And that means you're going to have to smile. A lot. Whole bunch of holiday cheer. And, you know... Okay! Are you done? No. No, no, no, no. I'm just gettin' started. You're impossible, you know that? Okay. Well, I'm going but tree, tomorrow. You got it. Hayley... we're taking my truck. Why? 'Cause we don't want to waste any time getting stuck in the snow, now, do we? Good night. Mistletoe? Definitely not. What? Nothing. Okay, fine. I may eat a lot of granola, but at least I don't have a creepy elf clock in my room. Hey! And, one... that's my childhood room. Two... I won an award for that clock. In the fifth grade. You... you made it? Well, I mean, it's not... it's not creepy, it's just... It's... A little creepy. It's okay. Don't worry about it. It was just a silly little contest, but... it was the first time I realized I liked making things. And you've kept it all of these years? Yeah. You're a lot more sentimental than I thought you would be. It's... Hold that thought! I wanted to get rid of it, my mom wanted me keep it. I just thought here might be better than my apartment. Good call. Yeah. Okay, we have definitely already been down this way. No, we haven't. What about this one? Yes! This has got to be it. No, no, no. What? Why? You can't just veto every tree I pick. It has no personality. It's a tree; not your future wife. It's too predictable. I mean, who wants a tree that's just... Perfectly symmetrical? Exactly. This. This is what I'm talking about. This has personality. It's a bare tree. It's not bare. It's just, you know... has its... its own thing going on. - Kind of like you. - I'll take that as a compliment. - What's that? - What's what? That smell. You smell that? I don't know. Pine? No, it's... Yes! I'm so excited. Really? You get this excited about nuts? Have you ever had roasted chestnuts before? Sure. At some point in my life. I don't remember. You'd remember. I'm just so happy! I make them every year. It's kinda like my own Christmas tradition. Like your...? My...? Well, come on! You must have some sort of holiday food ritual. No. No, I... I'm more into new experiences than traditions, you know? And, besides, I'm really not a nut person. Well, you might change your mind after this. I doubt it. We'll see. I'll have two boxes, please. - Wait! - One for my sister. Every time I eat them it's like my whole childhood flashes before my eyes. It's amazing. And you are definitely as sentimental as I thought you were. I will take that as a compliment. There you go. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Da, da, da... hold right there. Perfect opportunity. Just wait right there. Paul, what are you doing? Alright. - Smile. - Okay. You get one. Oh, come on, smile! - Bigger. - What? It's for my mom. - Okay. Fine. - Alright. There we go! Beautiful. She's gonna love it. It's magic. Come on. So, you really have no holiday food traditions? I mean, that's what makes it taste so good; it's that feeling you get with it. I know your mom. I know she goes all out, so... No, look, don't get me wrong, it's nice. I just don't get emotional about things like that. Well, do you want to try one? Paul! I can't believe it! I thought your mother said that you'd be in Sweden? Switzerland. Hey, buddy! No flights, you know? It looks like I'm here 'til Christmas. Well, that's great! That means you can come to the gala. Holiday Hounds. That's where I met Maxie last year, isn't it? Well, I guess it just depends on my flight, you know? Yeah, look, I know your mom is so upset about being sick, but tell her we have it totally under control. She sure does. Hey. So, when did you get into town? Yesterday. I decided to come in a day early. She may be a Los Angeleno now, but we can't keep her away from the East Coast for long. You know, I thought for sure that you'd be away for the holidays, again. - He's going away on Christmas. - Of course he is. Well... tha... tha... This is Amy's sister. She... She's a professional event planner, so if you guys need any help, it's... I'm Hayley. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. You know, we really should pay for that tree. We should? Yeah. It's pretty perfect and, I don't think it's gonna last long. - Okay. - Yep. Guys, it was so good to see you guys again. Both. - Merry Christmas. - So nice meeting you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Just so I'm clear... we're going with my tree, right? Yes, perfectly symmetrical. Bit brisk. Here. This is a good one. I will allow you to use this. - You will allow me? - Yeah. Very well, Your Highness. My mother will be pleased. You sure you don't want any of these? They're kind of amazing. Still good. I'm sorry about that. Well, if you're not a nut person I'm not gonna force you. No. Back there with Patti and Michelle. I know it was a little awkward. I have no idea why I offered you up for help but... thank you. For what? Rolling with it. So, you guys dated? That obvious? Yeah. Are you sure you don't want any of these? I mean, I don't know if it's the elevation, or all the fresh air, but I'm starving and... I don't know how much longer they're going to last. Okay. Get out. - What? Why? - Come on. - Let's go. It's not that far. Come on. - I thought we were going back? Not until we get you... some real food. You've reach Kim in marketing, please leave a message. Kim. Hi! It's me again leaving another message. I just wanted to make sure that you had everything you needed for tonight. Okay, great. Or not. - Still nothing? - Nope. I mean, I guess I should be happy that things are running smoothly without me. - It is all just meat? - Yeah. Pretty much just meat and a few sides. Pumpkin spiced ribs? Is that really a thing? At Christmas it is. Okay, well... before we order, I should probably let you know that I'm not the most adventurous eater. And that's why we're here. Alright, we'll take some of the pumpkin spiced ribs. The cranberry barbecued pulled pork and... The jalapeno mashed potatoes. Please. Is it possible to have those jalapenos on the side? - No. - No? What about the sauces? Okay, then. You know, considering that I usually like my plate half-green, half-protein with a side of fruit, I'm surprised how much I love this. See. No. No. You cannot say I told you so. I won't. You're about to. I can tell it's on tip of your tongue and you're just itching to say it. It's on the tip of my tongue? Right? You know, you have a little a... Look, I just think that, you know, tastes can change a little. That's all. Oh, really? Hey, Paul! - How long has it been? - Hey! Too long. - Good to see you. - You too. How's everything tasting? Honestly, I've never had barbecue so good. Now this is coming from Hayley. She's a fancy event planner from Manhattan, so "uh uh." Only on good days, but this is really tasty. Stop. No, really, go on. - I'll grab you my card? - Okay. That'd be great. Why do you do that? Do what? You sell yourself short like that. What? No, I don't! How could you think... You know what? No more observations out of you, mister. Yeah. Okay. Well, I think you're fancy. In a good way. How's that? So, you two went for lunch? And how was that? Fine. Fine? Really? That seems like a big shift since two days ago. Okay, I'll admit, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Wait. Do you actually like him? What? No. No, I don't "like" like him. I just... I don't dislike him as much as I thought I did. - Good. - What? I mean, good you like him, but don't "like" like him. I mean, that would be a bit awkward. Right. Though I do have to say you look a lot more relaxed now. Well. It's probably the fresh air. Okay, here you go. Here you go. A warning... my mom usually has, like, six other families out here caroling, so... - Sometimes eight. - Yeah, I'm not sure how it's going to sound - with just us... - Mi, mi, mi, mi... I feel pretty good. I think someone's dog howled through the entire chorus of Carol of the Bells. - And they ran back inside. - To hide. I think he was just impressed with my vocal prowess. Of course! That's a problem. And we will find a solution. - Hi, Patti. - Hi. - Everything okay? - Yeah, - just a tiny snag with the gala. - A snag? Hayley, I think we might need your help after all. Well, last year, we didn't have to do anything. We just put the link up online and half the town bought tickets. But now... You know, it's actually pretty normal for a second year fallout. Especially after the initial excitement. Yeah, but this is like... half the excitement. Not even. God! I can't let the pooches down. This is the charity's big event of the year! - What do we do? - You don't do a thing. Penn's right, sweetie. You look awful. I actually am feeling much better, but thank you. I bet Hayley has some good ideas. She's amazing. She does all kinds of events... private, corporate, charity. All super successful. Well, I haven't had time to give it any real thought, but you said the theme was Taste of the Shores, right? - Yes. Well, that's a whole other problem. - What problem? Well, if we don't get more restaurants to donate, our "taste" is going to be more of a "bite". Well, okay. For ticket sales, you just need to tease it. Give people a "taste" of what they're in for. What if we rename it Taste of the Holidays? To remind people what it's all about. Good people, good food and giving back. This will get people buying tickets? Not on its own, but give me a couple of hours and I will come up with a plan and give it to you first thing tomorrow. She's a hard worker, isn't she? Way too loyal, if you ask me. What do you mean? She's way overdue this promotion at work. She'd never admit it, but... everything she does turns out amazing. We'll stand in front of the venue. We'll create a festive atmosphere... People are going to be out and about anyway. And then we'll just... see. See? I know it sounds a little... grassroots, but I really believe that people want to give back. We can all just be wrapped up in our own world sometimes. Especially at the holidays. It's funny, I was convinced I was going to work through this cold. "I don't need to rest." But Penn was right. I guess sometimes what you think you want isn't always what you need. I gotta say it... these roasting kits were a great idea. Amy was right about you... you are good at your job. And this coming from a guy who hates chestnuts. Well, thank you for helping me with all this. Happy to help. So, what's next, coach? Merry Christmas! We'll see you tomorrow night! Chestnuts! These are beautiful! Be sure to check our website for tickets. They're going fast. Merry Christmas! - Hey. Everything's good to go in there. - Thank you. It's beautiful. And this is going to look amazing inside. I still can't believe Paul made this. And why not? I mean, come on, people need somewhere to put their donations, right? Well, I don't know. It's kind of traditional for you, isn't it? Too symmetrical? I deliver what the client needs. In this case, classic Christmas seemed ideal. And I... may have directed a large group of people your way. You're gonna be busy. Did you lure them in with your beautiful singing voice? Quite possible, yes. Okay, I think we're gonna get out of here. - Sure. - Unless you need help with anything else? No. I think we're good. I'm almost done. - Okay. - Okay. Alright, I'm gonna go hunt down some more people. Okay, you do that. Yeah, you know. How's my favorite event planner? Well, I think I might be your only event planner, but I'm good. You know, I didn't think these nuts were gonna do it but our ticket sales are already up. - Really? - But the food... I know. I've got to figure it out but don't worry, I think I have an idea. Well, keep this up and I'll have to tell my friend Miranda Watson to hire you. Did you say Miranda Watson, as in Watson Creative? - She's your friend? - Yes. Oh, my gosh, her firm does amazing work. Well, I might just have to snatch you up myself. Philanthropy is exhausting. Well, I think I'm good where I'm at, but thank you. Plenty of time to talk about that after the big night. Now, it's... back to work! - Merry Christmas. - Thanks! - We'll see you tomorrow? - You sure will! So, how'd it go? How do you feel about cinnamon ribs? Good. Good, because he just agreed to donate a ton for tomorrow night! Marketing division. Kim speaking. Hi, Kim. It's Hayley. I'm so glad I finally reached you! It went well? Excellent. So...? Looks like everyone's turning in for the night so... It's nine o'clock, grandma. I know but... Everything okay? With work? Yeah, it's fine. I finally got a hold of her. Turns out they wanna promote the both of us. For the next six months, and see who does better. So, like a co-promotion? Is that a good thing? Sure... for the one who doesn't get demoted afterwards. I don't know. I guess it's better than nothing, right? Is it? I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning. Okay. Or... maybe... you could show me how it's done. So, it's basically like s'mores. Without the marshmallows. Or the chocolate. Or the graham crackers. So, it's... basically nothing like s'mores. Pretty much. Alright, look, I'm just going to come out and say it. You don't like my holiday food tradition? I'm sorry. Well, I guess I forgive you 'cause at least you tried it. No... Not about that. I'm sorry about what I said at the wedding. Let's not go back there. I'm serious. It's okay. I'm over it. I've moved on. I said it... because I wanted you to know you deserve better. And I thought that then - I barely knew you - I know that now. I just want you to know that. You don't have to say that. Do I look like someone who would say something they don't mean? No, you don't. I've just always been that way. Like, when I get something in my head, I... have to stick to it. Even when I shouldn't sometimes. You know? As much as I hate to admit it... you were right. I should have seen it coming with my ex. He wasn't reliable and, in the long term, he wasn't gonna stick around. It's okay. You know... you're not the only one who didn't see things coming. Now she wants a fire. Almost ten o'clock at night and she wants a fire in the bedroom. You know what I think, son? I think she's milking it. Are those chestnuts you're roasting? Well, yes, sir, they are. Hayley is showing me one of her special Christmas traditions. I still can't believe he doesn't have one. What? A Christmas tradition? Oh, he has one. Thanks, dad. Wait, what? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Fine. I might have one. But it's specific to Christmas Eve. Well, are you going to tell me? Well, you're just going to have to set your alarm and find out. I gotta say, I didn't know your elf yelled. Not to mention "shimmied". Oh, yeah. Actually, I was going for more of a shake but... He's growin' on you, isn't he? Alright, well, I come bearing gifts. I brought coffee. Two cups in one. I'm touched. I'm glad. So, this is your one holiday tradition? Watching the sun rise on Christmas Eve. Yup. This is it. How long have you been doing this for? Oh, gosh... As long as I can remember. It actually started with my grandfather. He used to... He used to bring me out here every year when I was a kid. My grandma, she micro-managed the twelve days of Christmas. It'd get a little hectic so, you know, he'd just come out here for a little quiet... Just soak it all in. The meaning of Christmas? Yeah, but... Also, how fortunate... we are to be surrounded by family and friends. So, for me, I just thought it was a good thing to keep going. So, I do it every year. No matter where I am. - Really? - Oh, yeah. This day last year, I watched the sun rise in Cape Town. Clear across the Atlantic. See? You are more sentimental than you think. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You are far more adventurous than you think. I don't know about that. I mean, I've still got my two cups of coffee. True, but... you're out here. With me. At the crack of dawn. This is true. I'm glad you came. Me too. I'm glad you stayed. Me too. Are you sure you're well enough to go? Absolutely! I feel so much better. Okay. You sure? You know what? I think we're going to drive separately in case we need to leave early. Why would you leave early? No reason. I think we should do the same. Well, just in case. Right, well, that just leaves. Just beautiful. Thanks, sir. It's a nice suit. You think? Okay, should we go? We should go. - Right, well, we'll see you there. - We're driving separately? Okay... Well, it looks like you're stuck with me. You really do look beautiful. Thank you. - So... - What's that? Of course, I had to pull your name. And you're leaving early in the morning... And I figured that these might come in most useful tonight. I'm supposed to open this now? So, I originally made you an ornament for your truck out of the same stuff, thought you could hang it on the mirror or something, but then I thought the cufflinks were a better option. They're perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, honey, what do you think? I can't believe I'm out. And everything looks perfect! Yes, it does. Stop. I can't believe so many people showed up. It's amazing. And look at your sleigh! All the donations! You did it. We all did it. Now, more importantly, let's go find some ribs. We should probably follow them. Okay, so, I think I've got it figure out. I'm going to get a cake for tomorrow night's dessert. And it's going to say, "Baby Barnett, coming soon" Soon-ish. Or maybe I should just write the due date on the cake? Isn't Christmas cute enough? Okay, you know what? - These are better today. - Really? I think it's the memory. Like you said. The feeling the food evokes... I think it might just be the cinnamon. I don't know. I don't know because every bite I take I just keep having this vision, this picture in my head... you and BBQ sauce all over your face. - Stop! - I see... I might even have a photo. - Are you kidding? - I am not. No! No. Give that to me. No. Screen-saver. Give that to me. - Sorry. Hayley Parker? - Yeah. Hi, Miranda Watson. I was just talking to Patti about you. Oh, you were? I know you're off-duty, so I won't keep you but... if you're up for coffee some time, I'd love to chat. You've done a really great job here. Yeah, coffee sounds great. Terrific. Okay, I'll be in touch. Merry Christmas! - You too. - Thanks. Merry Christmas! Okay. What? You, thinking about another job opportunity. It's pretty adventurous. Well, this guy once told me that a little adventure might do me some good, so... You know what else might be good. What's that? Dinner. In the city. Just the two of us. Make it a proper date. Okay, hold that thought, hold that thought, hold that thought... On the off chance you might say yes, I think I should get seconds so I can create another positive food memory. I'll be right back. Oh, my gosh, I love these... thank you! Hi! Everyone is super impressed. But, god, I'm sorry you had to work over the holidays. I mean that's fine. It's a really good cause, and I wasn't the only one who pitched in. He's pretty great, isn't he? I'm sorry? Paul. At pitching in. You know, making things fun. Yeah, yeah, no, he was definitely a lot of help. Yeah, it's just too bad that he's impossible to pin down, right? Always on the move. Or at least trying to find a way to be. I don't know a lot about that, so... Listen... You seem like a nice, smart, talented woman. I just... I wouldn't wanna see you get hurt. Excuse me? He leaves tomorrow, right? Yeah. Yeah. First flight out he can possibly get? He's like that. He's always been like that. And he's never gonna change. You'll never be as important to him as his trips. Trust me, I know. But hey, wish him a good trip from me. Right. Okay, I might be a bit biased, but this is the best donut I have ever had. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just... Nothing. I'm good. Where's Paul? Hey, they're about to... Alright folks, gather 'round. It's time for the Christmas raffle. Hey. Do you want to find him? No, I'm fine. Let's go. Hi, I'm Patti Larson, the founder of Mill Creek Hounds Dog Rescue. Just before we get to the big raffle winners, I wanted to take a moment to thank you all so much for coming out tonight to help our holiday hounds find their perfect home, and to support all those who take care of them until they do. I also wanted to send a special thanks to Hayley Parker who really made this evening possible. Right, Judy? Absolutely, Patti. Hayley helped us figure out what we really needed. So, thank you, from all of us! And make sure you eat a lot more, because tonight, every bite counts. And don't forget to come and have your picture taken right here with my favorite pooch. So cute! Okay, who's ready to win some big prizes? Take it away, Judy. There you are. Two things... one, I think I lost our table and two... man, I got right to the front of the line, guy took the last ribs right before I got there. But I got us some... potatoes. I'm good, thanks. I know there are some jalapeños on it, but I feel like you're warming up to them, right. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. I actually think I'm gonna head back early with Amy and Tim. Right now? Why? 'Cause I'm the one who's gotta get up early. Yeah, I just think I have to go. What's going on? I'm sorry, I can't do this. Hey, hey. I don't understand. What just changed? Well, you don't understand because you don't stand still enough to notice. Hey, hold your horses. That's a bit harsh. Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know if it was the holidays, or my head getting lost in the clouds and then this thing that happened between us - if you can even call it a thing... But you're still going on this trip, and I don't expect you to change. Is that really what you think? I just don't wanna get more invested and then have you leave. Hayley, it's one trip. Okay, that's not what I'm talking about, though. Okay, why are you trying to sabotage this? - I'm not. - That's what you're doing. What, because I wasn't part of your plan? Please, do not turn this around on me. You were right. Okay, you were right. Are you happy? I should've seen all of the signs with my ex... I don't wanna make the same mistake again. Okay, so if I'm reading this right - I'm pretty sure I am - I'm going to make one more observation... I'm guessing you want your space again? Well, you're leaving first thing tomorrow morning so now, this time, it'll be really easy. Yeah, I guess so. I have to go. I guess we're both excited for the day. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. So, are we the only ones up? Well, Paul is already gone. Probably halfway to the airport by now. Are you okay? Me? Yeah, I'm fine. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. I feel like I barely saw you last night. So, the three of you left together? Is everything okay? Yup! No, it's good. 'Cause Paul seemed a little off as well, so I was just wondering... - I'm pregnant! - What?! Wait... Did I just hear that correctly? We're pregnant! Honey! Congratulations! We have to call your brother. We already told him late last night. Sorry, we were going to wait until dinner to tell you guys, we had it all planned out, there was this cute cake announcement and... Well, I wanted it to be perfect and I just blabbed it out. Are you kidding me, this is perfect. I'm so excited. Well, it's not your perfect. I know it might not be how you planned telling us, but the news itself... It's the best Christmas gift ever. Thank you. Alright, everybody, get your jackets. I have a surprise. - You do? - I do. And I think it's the perfect time for it. You can't be the only one who's over-the-top at Christmas. Although I think Amy might have beat us all this year! - I was involved! - Alright, come on. I have no idea. Thank you for covering for me. You've been covering for me all week. You okay? Yeah. You mean about... Yeah. He wasn't my type anyway. Right. Guess the flight will be pretty empty. Not a lot of people flying on Christmas Day. Still, sounds pretty exciting to me. Yeah, it should be. Okay, mister. Are you going to tell us where we're going, what we're doing? All you need to know is I brought hot chocolate. - This is for us? - This is your surprise? That's so cool! - Are we going far? - It's just an hour, round-trip. I know you love horses. This is wonderful. They're beautiful! I'm sorry... I mean, this looks... amazing, but if it's okay, I'm feeling a little tired. You should stay, relax. Really? You deserve a real day off after all the hard work you put in. I don't know what happened last night, but I do know that Paul didn't delay his vacation because of some storm. He stayed because of you. What? How do you know that? I'm his mother. It's my job to know these things. Oh, and Hayley, I think he left something for you under the tree. - Alright! Here we go! - My lady. What am I doing? Come on, answer. Hey, it's Paul. I'll be off the grid until the New Year. I Hope you can wait until then. Hi... it's Hayley. Listen, Paul, I... Hey! Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? You are supposed to be in Switzerland. Were you just calling me? I know I'm supposed to be giving you your space... But I can't. - You can't? - Nope. Sorry. 'Cause I was on my way, and I'm thinking about my trip, and I'm wanting so badly to be excited about it. But the only thing that got me excited was the thought of getting to know you more and more and more. And all your little quirks. I don't have any of those. And all your adorable habits. Okay, I might have a few of those. I know you don't think I'll ever stand still. But here I am. Right here, right now, standing still. I think I just needed the right reason. You. So, what do you say? You wanna give it a try... For that date in the city? I'm up for anything at this point. I'm really sorry about last night. I had... a moment. Really? Yeah. So, is this considered creating a new experience? Which part? All of it? Well, if I may. I was kind of hoping... we could make it a tradition. Which part? All of it. I love that you made me an elf clock. Still too creepy? You know, I think he might grow on me. There they are! RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
