born never mind about me there's a great story in this boy a real Cinderella angle he's been fighting to better himself ever since he was a kid in Jersey six months ago he comes back from the Army in Korea goes back to the fight racket fight and clean but not getting any of the breaks then he discovered in the ring by a millionaire named Allison Robert team Allison balance ins ball bearings that

Mallen oh hello tell me yeah they'd be right down I've just been reading about Jim and myself wealthy Long Island a developed sophistical chez I'm sorry about that thing see this friend of mine told him Alistair if I known he was going quite all right in fact I contributed a few of these your details I was ambushed by reporters when I went to luncheon to the club today thinking sure ask a lot of questions i tawt occur early Friday night it looked very good thank you sports writers the saying you've got the makings of a champion on Dave's then most epic no I don't think so didn't Tommy my attitude toward you up until now must have seemed strange at times like my refusing to see your early fight unforgivable I had met a reason but you seem like they're patronizing to enjoy I might have robbed you of your incentive this way stinging you on occasion was helping what you've accomplished you've done on your own you should be quite proud of that I hope you're gonna stay on here oh thank you sir so far it's worked out fine good - that's how we I'd like to talk to you about Dorothy she's in love with you you know well it needn't look so surprised I have noticed things seeing you two together are you in love with her yes I am I suppose you've thought about asking her to marry you can't afford to right now oh that's realistic now are these very naive about money she thinks she can live without the things that I tried to give her but there are other problems due to her from completely different worlds not that that's insurmountable no people change and grow intellectually and I'd like to help you that is if you don't mind fine why should i kitty huh Oh ready following look beautiful you're right dear your dress but it isn't it sure is well shall we go nighty-night he done where they're left to you come over here and better got a message for you and delivered probably my father talking about got another message the old man's in our corner I don't want him there look what do you say let me do the worrying huh you're playing right into his hands he doesn't want us to be together that's not what he said he thinks I'm right for you so that you are now strong we believe in yourself that's one of the things I like most about you you're able to fight for what you want Tommy my father isn't what he seems to me he doesn't give he takes they'll try to run your life between his pattern polish off the rough edges the many thrill there'll be nothing nothing left to fight with therefore I want you tested your honor I'm not going to change a colleague listen look I'll keep an eye on him until okay [Music] and I'm cubby holiday what's an used to like that hey the floor doesn't creak my mouth and said in rural Africa no place for a hungry fighter who wants to keep on winning aren't way I'm still handy I know they're a good nothing for nothing common [Music] [Applause] looks like Corelli all the way here looks good you could take him again Tommy I'd bet my last dollar [Applause] [Applause] you should have been there tonight instead of karate the sports I to think you're entitled the championship they've been playing up big sports writers don't sign contracts yeah yeah we got crammed and Corelli's name on a piece of paper they know max why don't you talk to cram Dave isn't the some kind of data cat Bank I had my belly fillet his kind of deal well what sort of plans do you have for Tommy well like I told him I think we should go on the road take bites all over the country Somaly builds up a big enough following crown we'll be forced to give him a crack at the title why don't you go on the road tell me now what Dave's talking about take two or three years money he'll does right here in New York and they doreen television another way is time club Dave the fight game is a business just like any other business there's no room for idealism they take my business it's a competitor becomes a real threat to what I have or what I want I am alga mate with them that way playing it smart nobody loses I ain't that kind of smart I don't want to be there's no need for that attitude dink we both have Tommy's best interests at heart but four years is a long time radio can happen why did Tommy move into the house and obviously I asked him to he doesn't belong here I sometimes think Darby with yerba snob and his family Tommy and I have been getting along just fine what I've seen if you're in love with him therapy you ought to realize but unless he grows intellectually unless it interest correspond with yours it wouldn't work together we can make something out of him like you've made something of me dependence insecure not quite measuring up make him willing to compromise for the way of life you're showing what money can buy well I won't even watch it this time I'm getting out for good guys tell me wait a minute what's the matter what happened she's leaving leaving where's she going now don't worry about it she'll be back wait if you go after now you'll only make matters worse there are these disturbed about you moving into the house why chief you're from interfering in your life tell me the important thing to you is to get financial independence as soon as possible so I could give you money but I don't want it that of course you don't the answer it seems to me is to get into the big money and soon once you get it your futures guaranteed then you'll have time to go after that championship yeah but how it seems to me that all the business being done in this town is big done with cramp they won't hold still for that it's your life to me and Dorothy I've got to have a shot at the title I need it now I can't even get my footing crams office couldn't we played along you better give me that again I'm not sure I heard it Who am I to change the world I need a stake a bit tell grandma give credit and to wipe out that decision I want anomic you'll pay for a shul English boy you'd go in the tank I said find out how
