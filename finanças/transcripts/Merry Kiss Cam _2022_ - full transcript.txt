Yeah, no, still hasn't replied, in case you were wondering. And I want youto be happy. I am happy. I am. You know, Mark and I, we spent years traveling and chasing our big dreams.

Oh, he's retired now, but he worked for Bulldogs, for, like, 40 years. He was in charge of maintenance on the Zamboni. What the hell is a Zamboloni?

Hm, uh, why don't you tell me what you think a Zamboni is. - Okay, a Zamboni. - Simple. Yes. Is it a horn that you blow when someone gets a goal? - Maybe? - This close, so close. It's... Okay, it's a giant machine that someone drives on to the ice to, yes, to shave and clean the ice, so it's ready for the next part of the game.

Well, did you, uh, always know you wanna be an artist? Mm, you know, for the longest time, I thought my art would only hang on my parents' fridge. But then I had the most amazing teacher who made a living selling her art, and it lit a spark. I was, um, studying in Indiana, and the university here offered me a teaching fellowship.

Yeah, I know. And it was only, like, two years ago. Hey, listen, listen, listen. "In addition to his success in business, Mark was also known for his charitable spirit. He was the driving force behind the construction and programming of the Duluth Art Institute, which will now be named in his honor." The guy's building's named after him. You have a bar named in your honor. Hey, come on, Rick, my dad named this place after himself. Named after your family, which makes it legacy. Look at this guy's accomplishments. Wait, wait, wait. Are you reading me his obituary? - Is that weird? - Yes! That's weird and creepy. I guess I'm just surprised that sh-she didn't mention anything. Okay, well, not everybody is like you and spills their whole life story at the drop of a coaster. Everybody processes grief differently. Uh, think about when you lost your dad. Yeah, yeah, you're right, um... You're right. What do I do? Closing the window with his obituary would be my first move. Oh, my God. You really like him, don't you? Okay, I'm trying not to go overboard. But, yes, we had a good time. Hi. And he gets you out of your dark little cocoon. You know, which I thought I would hate. But... that kiss. Mm, that kiss. Do you think it was too forward? It was a Kiss Cam, okay? I was under a lot of pressure. And heat. Well, just saying. - Oh, wait. - Oh! - No, no, I've... - Take it, take it. I've been avoiding. It's the art institute. They want me to help them with this after-school program. Why would they bother you with that? Maybe because I promised them that I would do it. - Jess! - I know. I know. It was always important to Mark. And then it gets me thinking about Mark. And with this, you know, whatever this thing is with Danny... You're moving on. It's perfectly normal. I just don't know if I'm ready. Ah. No one is ever ready, but life goes on, whether we like it or not. - So have you told Danny? - About Mark? He's probably figured it out already. Well, that's not the same as telling him. And I doubt he figured anything out about you. The man has a flip phone. You know, you're always talking about how honesty is the most important thing to you? - Then just be honest. - Maybe you're right. You know, he did say he wanted to see my work.

Well, since everyone's in a jolly mood, now's a good a time as any to announce. The powers that be have asked me to invite you two to host the Bulldogs Annual Holiday Shootout! What do you say? - Uh... - Um, heck. Why not? - What did I just agree to? - Oh, man. Oh, my family's gonna flip. We make a whole day out of it. We take my nieces out to ice-skating and pizza afterwards. It's a whole thing. You're gonna meet literally my entire family. Like, everyone. The whole Carmody clan. - Wow, that's some... - Yeah. That's-that's great. That's so great. It's-it's, um... Yeah. - Ahem. - You guys! - Hi! - Hi! Danny, you remember Jared? - Good to see you, man. - Likewise. - Yeah. - Hi. People are officially losing their minds over you two. Today I literally saw someone with a sweatshirt. - With both of your faces on it. - You think that's crazy? I walked past St. John's and the priest yelled, "Pucker up, Pretzel!" Well, you're kind of screwed 'cause no one can change anything, because if they lose, they'll blame you forever. - Do you want people to hate you? - No one? - No! - Not anything at all? You haven't had the conversation about Mark. I can't. Everything is so perfect. I don't wanna cast a shadow over it all. You know what they say the worst conversation is? - Illuminate. - The one you're not having. Look, we always think it's worse than what it is. I'm just saying, it's not gonna get any easier. I can't be the first girl you've danced with in your bar. Mm. Is that a little jealousy I'm sensing? Maybe. Look. All I've ever heard is that everyone is in love with you. So you being single doesn't add up. I-I live here. I work here. I know everybody here. It's, it's been hard to meet someone. ♪ Can't be mine holding ♪ Mm. I'm glad I happened in. Me, too.

You can tell me. I, I'm feeling kind of nervous about spending a whole day with your family. I don't even do that with my own family, ever. - Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry. - No. No, no. Don't be. No. It just, I get, uh, weird around the holidays. Hey, it's, it's fine. You do not have to do anything that you don't wanna do. Can I ask why the holidays are hard for you? It's just, um... I... It's deadlines. Uh, Sonja always schedules my show around this time. I am in the middle of painting this series and I am really behind. Yeah, no. I didn't realize. And Sonja, she gets here tomorrow, and when she see my progress, she's gonna lecture me... Uh, I, uh, wish there was something I could do or say to... help. Someone once said to me they liked the lake best in winter... how the sun melts it one day and then refreezes it the very next day. Reminded him it-it was alive. Um, should we go inside? I, I feel like if you need to work or, you know, I can give you a ride home. No. No, stay. For a minute. I like this moment. - Now, that is a party. - Yeah. Hey, you and Jess looked pretty cozy last night. Things are getting serious, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I... - I think so. - You don't sound so sure. There's something that we need to talk about, but we aren't. Ah! That's half of what makes a relationship work. Ignoring the right things. But, uh, you think it's something that could end you two? I mean, I, I hadn't been thinking that, but, uh, maybe. Let me give you a piece of advice. I would actually really appreciate that right now. Drag it out until the season's over. I don't care if you mess up your relationship. It wouldn't be the first time. But don't mess up this season. We're too close. Thank you, Uncle Pat, for your kind words of comfort and support. That's what uncles are for. - I wanted to... - Jj-jj! Unh! I haven't exactly figured... - Jess. Jess. - What? What is it exactly that I'm looking at here? Ah... - Um... - Mm. I, I, I haven't exactly figured out what I wanna say. - Well, that much is clear. - But... I promise you, I am going to buckle down. I-I feel a breakthrough coming. - Uh-huh? Really? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, great. Wonderful. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know, I saw a familiar face puckering up on the, uh, local news this morning. I mean, you seem to have become a big hit in this town. I'm not laughing. It is nothing, okay? Really, Sonja, it's nothing. Dating is not nothing for you, Jess. It's a big deal. I-I'm aware of that. And I'm proud of you. And that's your friend Sonja talking. Hm? The gallery owner who has invested a great deal of time and resources into you is gonna talk now. I do not represent artists who aren't focused, who miss shows, who don't take opportunities sitting right in front of them seriously. - Are you dropping me right now? - No! No, no, no! Most certainly not. Well, not right now anyway. But, look, I need you to know this. Your friend Sonja will always be here. Understand? - Understood. - Okay. Yes, well, I-I-I-I... Yeah. Well, I'll-I'll just leave you to it. Yeah? Whatever that is. Hm. - Hello? It's fine. - Hey. How's work? Uh, can I get you anything? Uh... A coffee or a gingerbread latte or something? No. Um, thanks, though. It would just be another way to procrastinate. Oh. Got it. Okay. Well... I was just calling to, uh, to see what time you wanted me to pick you up, the-the game starts at 7:00. Didn't know if you wanted to get dinner first... Oh, Danny. I can't tonight. I-I-I have so much work to do. Oh, okay. Uh, okay. Thought we, thought we had a plan. I know, we did, and I'm sorry. But I just really, really need to pull my show together. Uh, are you sure, maybe just if you wanna come for the third period? Just a little distraction for you. See? Distraction is the problem. I can't go to every game. Okay? I can't... I can't take on that kind of pressure. Yeah, no, totally. Um, I get that. - I hope so. - Okay. I'm so sorry. Call me later. - Hi. What's all this? - Where's Jess? - She's working. - What? No! I told you about your shootout costume-fitting at the party. At least I think I did. Did I? - Uh... - Arms out, please. We-we can reschedule with Jess. There's still time before the shootout. Where is she? We'll just go to her next. - No, you will not. - Danny-boy! - There is a schedule here. - Well, what can I say? She's busy. We'll-we'll-we'll figure it out. You know, if your Aunt Laurie and I had the opportunity to dress up like big, kissing lips... puckering. You know, we went as Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson for Halloween one year. What? Why are you telling me this? I'm just saying. Got pretty steamy when we got home. Your aunt looked pretty sexy with that beard. - Oh, no. - I can see it. I don't like it, but, but I see it. Can't unsee it. Hello? Oh. Danny. Hey. Oh. I-I, I guess Pat did tell you about the fitting. - You call this an emergency? - Wait, what? Wait, I said I was on a deadline. I'm painting. - No, I-I thought you were. - Well... Wait, did you trick me to get me here? Whoa! What? No... W-what are you talking about? Um, I... Oh, no. I'm sorry. Please. Can you just... Yeah. Not-not right now. Thank you. Look, okay, Danny, I'm sorry, but I, I can't. I can't risk my career over a superstition. I can't do the shootout, I can't do the games. I'm not a mascot. I'm sorry. No, I-I get that. I-I'm sorry.

Hey, did you know Santa's biggest regret every year after the hubbub of Christmas? No. What is it? Lack of elf-awareness. It was me, Jess. Danny had nothing to do with it. I-I'm sorry. Forgive me? Show's over, Pretzel. Better late than never? - Hi. - And I hate letting people down. And I see that I missed it. I'm sorry. No. I-I... I'm the one that should be sorry. I... No, it's okay, Uncle Pat stopped by with donuts, bad jokes and an apology. I'm sure he did, because I was about to ban him from the bar for life. I am sorry. I lost my temper yesterday. I never should've made you feel pressured into anything. Yesterday when I got home, I was so overcome with emotion, I haven't painted like that in a long time. - I didn't mean to upset you. - It was good. - It was good? - Cathartic, really. Look, I, uh... Uh, I have to tell you something. What is it? I was engaged. And my fiance, Mark... he died two years ago. And I didn't wanna ruin anything, so I didn't tell you. Jess, uh... I'm-I'm sorry. That's terrible. And I'm not proud of myself for keeping it from you. So much has been coming up, well, emotions and-and confusion and, uh, pressure from work and... It's okay. It's okay. I'm-I'm, I'm really glad you told me. - Yeah? - I understand. See, you say that, but Idon't even understand. - And... Well... - What? Look, I realize it's not fair to you for me to pretend like I'm single when I-I don't have the first clue of how I separate myself from him. And... that's the honest truth of it. But you don't have to separate yourself. He's just a part of you now. - And I'm okay with that. - You're sweet. I, I gotta get back to work. - I'll-I'll call you later, okay? - Okay. It's all out there now, but somehow it feels worse. Gosh, she was all set to marry this great guy. She knows that I know, but she doesn't know that I knew, and I think she just thinks it all feels weird and wrong. Are you keeping track of all this, 'cause I-I got a little lost there myself, but bottom line is that I can't give up, I can't give up, I gotta figure out how to let her know that it's okay, it's... Yeah. I know. I gotta do something. Yeah. Where are you taking me? It's, uh... We're almost there, we're almost there. Wait, what? Wh... Wait, wait. What are we doing? What are we doing here? Hey, Danny, what are we doing here? Uh, this is the surprise. Okay. Look, I don't think you understand. No. No, no, no. I do. I understand that... You, yesterday you told me about Mark. I need you to know that I'm okay with it. Really? Wait, hold on. Hold on, what are you talking about? Yes, yesterday I told you about Mark. I didn't tell you about this place. No, but, um... - But, I, uh... - What, you, like, looked it up? Well, yeah, I guess. Is that... I haven't been here since Mark. Hey, I-I didn't mean to... That was the worst year of my life. Uh... When did you find out about this? How long have you known about it, about Mark? Uh, I knew, okay? I got curious. I felt that was a natural reaction. I, but I knew it wasn't my place to bring it up. No, it wasn't. It wasn't your place. This is not your place. No, I know. I know it's not my place. That's what I'm trying to say. Let's see, what else? What else did you find out about? - Oh, the lakes, okay. - No, Let's-let's not do this. - Um, his businesses. - I tried to ask you about it. Get you to tell me that you, you... Did you read the interviews? Oh, my God. "Everything you can imagine is real?" So that wasn't a coincidence at all. You knew about it and you used it. Oh. No, no, no. That was an accident, okay? - Jess, can you hear me out? - No, I... I need to be alone. I have to think. It's freezing, just let me... I'll give you a ride home, okay? Danny, I'm sorry. Okay?

I thought it was implied in my, oh, I don't know, 100 conversations or texts. Oh. I've had a huge breakthrough and I'm halfway there. Oh! This is good news, isn't it? - Oh. - Oh, it will be fine. What will be fine? Okay, although you're definitely on Santa's naughty list, I really can't complain because somebody's already bought every piece of Winter: Light And Dark. Ah! - Way to bury the lead! - I know. This is, this is, this is amazing. Who? Who is it? They told me not to get into any details with you, they will meet you at your place at 1:00 today. Sonja, I mean, thank you. Shh. Not another word. And, Jess... Do you think I don't understand what you're going through? It's been heartbreaking for me to be a part of it. I just felt like you needed to get back into your painting just as much as you needed to get back into life! So as your rep and your friend, hm, I love you. I... Mm-mm! Watch the dress. - Mwah. I know. Mm-mm-mm! - I love you, too. - Okay. - Go, go, go. Perfect. I said the middle. Uh! Bebe? It's you? I-I... Where's Otto? Oh, he had a previous engagement. I know you must be a little surprised to see me here. It is very unexpected. Well, come in. Um, yeah, come in. Oh, my God. How did you know I needed a buyer? Oh, we stopped in Danny's for a drink on Tuesday night after he extended an invitation. - It's very charming there. - Mm. You can't deny that. Uh, do you mind if I take a closer look? Please. You know, I can't tell you how much your support means to me. I mean, the-the color, the light, the texture. Ah. These are tremendous. I've been terrified to show them to anyone. Yeah, this must have been a very difficult series. Hm. I, I didn't wanna be disappointed. I-I... I can't take on much more disappointment. Ah, but that's life, Jess. You knew that. Without a bit of risk, what would there be to gain, in art and in love? Now, I understand, this is only half of what we purchased, correct? Yes, um, this is Winter Dark. Um... Some of the pieces are wrapped up, but I, I haven't started on Winter Light. Well, we'll have Winter Dark picked up by courier tomorrow morning, and as for the other pieces, I'd like you to choose their home, where you see fit. - Hm? - You let us know. We wanna make a donation. What? Bebe! That is so generous. Thank you. No, thank you. I haven't had this much fun with a surprise since I hid inside Otto's 60th birthday cake. Imagine his face when his twin sister popped out. Twin sister! So d-do you have a place in mind? - I think I do. - Good. Well, this is it, folks, this is the game Bulldogs Nation has been waiting for. Thanks to some timely losses by the Stouts and also by the Whirlers, the Bulldogs playoff hopes are still alive. Yes, and the Bulldogs are now in a position where they can control their own destiny. And it's really a very basic principle. Absolutely. Win, they're in, lose and... Oh, well, we'll know what happens then. Who would've thought, after that epic losing streak, that we would both be sitting here right now? - Hey. Jess! - Hey, Jess. Hey. Uh, Is Danny around? - Up on the roof. - Okay. Hey, stranger. Uncle Pat told me you were up here. Hey, I just came from the art institute. - Is that a good thing. - Mm. Yeah, after you talked to Bebe the other day, she decided to purchase all my paintings and donate the unfinished ones to wherever I choose. Thank you. Uh, that must feel amazing. It does. Yeah, feels great. Jess, I don't know what I was thinking. We weren't thinking or... Maybe we were thinking too much. Every day I wanted to tell you, but every day I was just falling harder and harder for you. And I did a dumb thing. I mean, Mark didn't know anything about art either. But like you, he just knew what he liked. And he was kind and generous like you, too. - You don't have to... - No. I know that I don't have to. But you need to know that you have inspired me more than I could ever tell you. But I do still miss him. I still see my dad every day. Um, every time I walk by the place where he used to add up the receipts at his desk, any time my uncle cracks his dumb smile. - Yeah. - Uh... I'm-I'm so thankful for the ways that he's still here, and the things he left behind. It's different, but they're never gone. They're never gone. I appreciate that. And I'm trying and I'm... I've made mistakes, too, and you've been amazing. I just, um... I'm not good at all of this right now. It's okay, it's okay. Come here, Jess. I just... I can't. Bulldogs with the puck out of their own zone, they get to the red line and move it up to the blue line and dump it in the Stingers' zone. Yeah, so far, Tom, I've really been impressed what those Bulldogs have done in the offensive zone. Hey, Jess? In case I don't see you again, I just wanna give you a hug. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Don't give up. Don't ever give up on love. Okay, Uncle Pat. Come on, walk you out. So is this goodbye? For now. Uh, I can, uh, I can give you a ride. No. Uh... It'll be fine. Come on, you got a bar full of customers. It's not my first time taking a cab. Uh, Brooklyn and Fourth, please. Delacruz back out to neutralize, they have to reset, time 20 down on the clock, an opportunity for... How did it go? Uh, well... She's gone and I'm in here, so, I'd say, not good. What do you always say we gotta have? Hope! Not sure it's in the cards on this one, guys, but thanks. Let me pour you a beer, from your own bar? - Sorry, Danny. - Yeah, thanks. Back all the way to the other side. Back into the corner. Then it goes to the high spot. There's a shot, there's a chip... They gotta go back all the way to the other side, now across the blue line, they get to the red line and across to the blue line. Now the intensity is picking up... Come on, Dogs! Sorry. I-I can change it if you'd like. No, uh, it's fine. You can leave it. In this period. Close game between both these teams. The puck goes inside the zone, back into the corner, back to the high top. Then it goes back over the other side, back toward the high neutral spot. Then it goes into the corner, it goes from one side to the other side... Come on. May as well check out the game. Only halfway through the second. May as well. - Oh, no. No! No! No! No! - What? That... My lucky silver dollar! I don't have it! - Where is it? - Must be at home. - Well, go get it! - Go on! - Here's your ticket. - Okay, all right. I'll see you there. I'll see you there. Break up! Pat forgot the silver dollar! It's all over now. Oh... I can't believe it. I thought we really had a chance. As the time feels like it's flying off the clock faster than we've seen this Bulldogs season slip away from us. Wait, there might be hope. It appears half of our lucky-lips duo is here. That's right, "Lucky Lips" Danny Carmody is seated and ready, but no Pretzel in sight. Let's see if he has any impact on the Bulldogs. Where's Pretzel? Uh, just-just gonna be me and Uncle Pat today. Oh. Screwed it up, huh? You suck, idiot. - I don't disagree. - All right. I was a little harsh on the "idiot" there, right? - Thanks. - But you still suck. Uncle Pat. I'm sorry, just... just don't go back 'cause, it's, um... - I'm sorry. - Please don't apologize. - You shouldn't feel sorry. - No, no, no, no, no, no. It's fine. - Go! Go, go! Let's go! - Let's go! It's hard to believe, but they just might have a Christmas playoff miracle in them after all. - What's the score? - It's all tied up. Probably not for long. It's now or never for your Bulldogs. You mind if I just sit here till Pat gets here? Be my guest. - Time out, Bulldogs. - Cool. All right, Bulldogs fans, it's time to get lucky. And, boy, do we need it, so pucker up! Oh, wow. The family sandwich kiss. Haven't seen that in a while. Okay, who's next? Oh, foam-finger guy says, "Pick me." Damn, he doesn't waste any time. And there is the trench coat in the cheap seats. Oh! She turns him down. This is it. Do it. Oh, boy. Anything for luck, right? One half of our lucky-lips... It's okay. It's just a kiss. Is that Jess? It appears Pretzel is back in the building. Wait a minute. Is that Pretzel? - Oh, thank God. - What? Thank God what? - I'm not good enough for you? - No, you're great, you're... - Adorable. Yeah. Just... - Okay, okay, uh... Pretzel's more my type. Oh. I'm... She... Totally. - Please. - Oh! I'm all right. Yeah. I'm good. I'm-I'm sure your time is coming, but first, all about these two. So, uh... falling for me, huh? Late head over heels in love. Maybe that kiss really was lucky. - Wanna find out? - For luck. For luck. Yeah. Let's make some noise! And there's the kiss we've all been waiting for. - No! - Back together again. Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel! Uncle Pat, I thought you were... I saw that little devil sneak the tickets in her pocket. - Good move. - Good going, Pat. Come here. - Hey, cheers, everyone! - Hey! Look, look... Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, look! - Five seconds to go. - Oh, my God! Oh, my! The Stingers' defender has... - Get it in! - Fallen down! Oh! Larouex has done it again! He has done it again! That's it, folks. The Bulldogs are going to the playoffs. Bulldogs! Oh, my gosh! So art is not about making things within the lines or keeping everything in its boxes. Art is not only about making you think, but it's about making your thoughts and your mind feel free. So paint what makes you feel free. Yeah? - Oh, Theresa, I gotta go. Okay? - Oh. Um, gang, keep up the good work, and I will see you next week. This is gorgeous. I'm not mistaken, you gave me this vest, uh, four years ago, and I gave it back to you. - Wait, wait. Shh. - Shh. Shh. Shh. Don't tell me what you want for Christmas. I'm just gonna get you another plaid shirt. I know you don't need another... What-what are you... What's going on? Why aren't you people drinking? We all wanted to get you something real special for Christmas this year, and, uh, Jess came up with a perfect idea. I hope you like it. Okay, everybody, ready? One, two... three!
