(MultiCom Jingle) (slow, soft music) (slow, soft music) - No. (slow, soft music) (sighing) - [Man] It's just too weird. If I could only stop. - [Nurse] Just talk to me about it. It's gonna be okay. - [Man] Oh, if I could stop thinking about it. - [Nurse] Well just tell me about it. Get it off your mind. - [Man] It's too weird. I just... - [Nurse] Just talk to me about it. - [Man] I can't get it out of my mind. (rattling) (door locking) (hitting) (yelling) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - [Doctor] Calm down, it's alright. - [Nurse] Come on George, come on. (George sobbing) - [George] I'm sorry! (George sobbing) (grunting) (glass shattering) (rain falling) (dialing) (phone ringing) - I got it, Sarah. (soft jazzy music) (phone ringing) Hello? (rain falling) Hello? - Um. I... (heavy breathing) - Is something wrong? What's the matter? - I don't know. I guess it's time for us to get our number changed again. (rain falling) (cars honking) (rain falling) - Yes sir, can I help you? - No, it's okay. - Who did you wish to see? - I'm a friend of Miss St. Clair's. - I'm afraid Miss St. Clair isn't in now. - Oh, I'll just go in then. - No sir, unless you have some specific business. I'm sorry. (rain falling) Hi Mrs. Ike. I'll get you a cab. (whistle blowing) (rain falling) There you are, ma'am. (people chattering) - [Man] Well Marion, you ready to go? - Sir, can I help you? What can I help you with, sir? - Oh, the man outside asked me that. - Well now I'm asking you. - Um, I'm a friend of Dinah St. Clair's. - Miss St. Clair is not in now, sir. - Not in? She lives here, doesn't she? Well what does the P stand for? Penthouse? - She's not in now. Can I help you? - It's okay. I'll just go up and wait for her. - I'm afraid that's impossible. - It's not impossible, that's stupid. There's an elevator right here that goes up to the penthouse. - I'm sorry sir, but you will have to leave now. - Why? What have I done? - Look, what's your name? I'll tell her you stopped by, okay? - You don't have to know my name. - Okay, then a telephone number then. I'll get her to give you a call. How about an address? Is there an address where she can contact you? - No, it's okay. I'll come back another time. (slow, dramatic music) (slow, dramatic music) (rain falling) (slow, dramatic music) (rain falling) (slow, dramatic music) (rain falling) (rain pattering) (car honking) (car honking) - Thanks. Thank you, Stanley. (cars honking) (upbeat acoustic guitar playing) (slow, soft music) (chuckling) - How you doin'? (chuckling) (slow, soft music) Thank you, thank you. Good boy. (slow, soft music) - Good afternoon, Miss St. Clair. - Good afternoon, Stanley. Thank you. (slow, soft music) (slow, soft music) - Hi, Dinah. - Hi. - You need me? - No. - Okay, I'm gonna go home now. I made dinner. It's in the warming oven. - Okay, Sarah. - Is your father coming in later? - His flight gets in about nine. - Well the food's in there if he wants it. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. Okay, bye. - Bye. (door closing) (door locking) (soft jazzy music) (soft jazzy music) (cars honking) (soft jazzy music) - Back in five, okay? - Okay. Back again, huh? - She's in. I saw her. - So? - So, I'm going up to see her. - You're not going anywhere except out that door. (dramatic music) Come on now. (groaning) (slow, dramatic music) (water running) (soft jazzy music) (doorbell ringing) (soft jazzy music) (slow, dramatic music) - Who are you? - Flowers for Miss St. Clair. - Why didn't the security guard buzz me from downstairs? - I didn't see any security guard. - Joey? Is it you? - Hi. - Oh my god. I don't believe it. (keys jangling) (soft tinkling music) It really is you. - I'm back. (slow, soft music) - Come on, come inside. (slow, soft music) (laughing) (Dinah humming) There. They're pretty. - That's our song. - What? - That's our song you're singing. - I guess seeing you put it in my head again. - Can I look around? - Sure. Well, wait, Joey, I'll give you the grand tour. My father's bedroom's through there. This you've seen. - What's through there? - That's the terrace out there. - Oh, the terrace. Can I see? - Sure. Joey, wait. I'll get the door. (door opening) - It's beautiful! (laughing) - In the summertime, we eat our breakfast out here. - Yeah? I was on a 45 story building once when they were still working on it. It was beautiful. You feel so small and quiet like you'll just float away. - It sounds like you've been working in construction. Have you been doing that? ♪ Fly away, you and me ♪ ♪ Fly away together ♪ ♪ Fly away, you and me ♪ ♪ Fly away together ♪ (laughing) Come on. - [Joe] What was the name of the group that sang that song? - [Dinah] They were out of San Francisco. You know, I still have that record around here someplace. - [Joe] Oh put it on, I wanna hear it. - Joey, it would take me hours to find it. I wanna talk to you. I mean, I wanna find out what you've been doing. - No, no, no, put it on. Please, I really wanna hear it. - Okay, I'll look for it. We can put it on the remote speakers while we continue the grand tour. (answering machine beeping) - [Man] Hi Eugene, I'm sorry I missed you. Nothing important, I just want you to give me a call when you're back in town. - What's that? - What? - There's someone here. - That's just my father's answering machine in his bedroom. (Dinah sighing) Joey, I'm not gonna be able to find that record. I'll look for it, and the next time you come over, we can play it. - Oh, I'm not going. - What? - Well, I mean I just got here. - You know, it's amazing. You're not that different. - I'm not that different from what? - Well from when we were 15, the last time I saw you. You're just the same. - I am the same. - Well no, you're not. You're a man now. - Yeah, well, big deal. - So, what have you been doing? Where have you been? - This and that, around and about. - Why didn't you ever call me? Or write me? Why'd you just disappear like that? - I didn't disappear. You moved away. - Oh come on, Joey. In the last five years, my dad's become one of the most visible men in the world. - I know. I've been reading about you, working at your dad's record company and all. - I'm vice president of something, but he doesn't let me make any decisions. - I've thought about you everyday for over seven years. You know how many that is? 2,556 days. - Okay. Then, why didn't you ever try to reach us through the business? - I didn't know if you wanted to see me. - Joey. Why wouldn't I wanna see you? You're practically like my brother. - You mean you don't know? - Know what? - Oh, nothing. I mean, um, your dad doesn't like me. - All that stuff happened such a long time ago. He's probably forgotten all about it. - I don't know about that. He lives here with you, huh? - Yeah. About every six months I announce I'm gonna move out, find a place of my own, and he always finds a reason for me to stay. - He coming back soon? - I wouldn't expect him for a couple of hours yet. Don't worry about it, okay? - Oh I'm not worried. I'm not worried at all. - Joey. Are you okay? You look like you've had a hard time of it. - Yeah, well, life isn't as easy for everyone as it's been for you. - Are you angry at me? - Angry at you? I could never be angry at you, never. I love you. - I love you, too, but, maybe you're angry at me for going away. - I know that wasn't you. I know your father made you do it. - He was just trying to protect me. - I never hurt you. Never. - No. But you locked me in your room for six hours. - I just wanted to make sure you'd be there when I got home from school. Listen, I mean, I set up the TV for you so you wouldn't get bored. (laughing) (phone ringing) - Excuse me. Hello? - I'm sorry to bother you, Miss St. Clair. This is Stanley. You haven't by any chance seen Michael? - Michael from downstairs? - Yes, ma'am, the security guard. He seems to have disappeared. I'm calling the tenants in case anybody's seen him. - Um, no, I haven't seen him. Hold on a minute. Joey, you said there was no security guard? - No, there was no one down there when I got here. - Stanley, I've got a friend visiting and he said that there was no security guard when he arrived. - Oh, well I only went out to catch a smoke. I wasn't away more than five minutes and when I came back, he was gone. He never said a word. Well thanks, Miss St. Clair. I'm sure he'll turn up. - Okay. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. That's strange. - What? - Well Stanley was taking a break. Michael would never leave his post. That leaves the whole building totally unguarded. - Who knows. Say, you got something to eat? I'm kind of hungry. - Sorry. There's a whole dinner in the warming oven. Why don't you come out and give me a hand with it? - Oh. I gotta use the bathroom. - Alright, my dad's bathroom's through there. Just go through the bedroom. - Okay. (slow, soft music) (key jangling) - What are you doing? - This is a beautiful thing. - Did you take the key to the front door? - Why were you watching me? - I wanted to know if you wanted butter or sauce on your rice. Did you take the key? - Why are you asking me all these questions? - Because I want an answer. Did you take the key? - I have to keep the key for a while. - For what? - I don't want anyone bothering us. - Joey. My dad'll be home in a little while. - No he won't. - What'd you say? - Your dad won't be coming home. I fixed it so he can't bother us. - How? - Dinah, no. It's alright. You don't need to know. - Joey, are you being a bad boy again? - You don't need your dad. I'm here now. Now. To answer your question. - What? - I take butter in my rice. Man, this food is great. Do you eat like this all the time? What is this stuff anyway? - Orange roughy. - Orange roughy? - It's a fish. (chuckling) - Man I could get used to this in a hurry. - So, Joey, what have you been doing for the last eight years? Stop holding out on me. - What do you wanna know? - Did you ever get to college? I mean you always said you wanted to study microbiology. - Are you kidding? When you left I was in too much trouble. - What kind of trouble? - You remember my Aunt Grace? - Mhm. She came on to take care of you after your mom and dad died. - Yeah, well, you know we didn't get along so good. One day she called the cops on me, so I took off. After that, I didn't look back. - Why'd she call the cops? - Who knows. She was totally bananas, you know that? She claimed, um, I tried to make her jump out of a window. Can you believe that? (chuckling) - So you ran away? Were you on the streets? - I got along okay. I took my brains with me. Worked in demolition for a while, blowing up buildings. I liked that. - So what happened to that? - To the job? What always happens. Goes. Everything goes. Except you. You don't go. Man, this is the life. - Joey what do you mean I don't go? - I mean you're here. You don't go. I'm here, I don't go. I'm gonna be with you for the rest of my life. (clicking) (sighing) - Stanley? Stanley? - Yes, Mr. St. Clair? - My elevator's not working. Where's Michael? - Um, he, um, I don't know, sir. He stepped out. - Stepped out? (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Eugene] Dinah? - [Dinah] Oh hi, dad. - Honey, will you check the elevator like a good girl? See if anything's jamming the door? - Okay. Daddy, guess who's here? - Honey, just check it will you? I'll see who's there when I get upstairs. - Okay, the elevator, hold on. - Dinah. No! - Joey, stop it. Let me go. - It's alright. I'll take care of it. - Joey, this has gone far enough, now let me go. (slow, dramatic music) (door unlocking) Oh no. Oh my god. (hitting) (dramatic music) What have you done? Give me the key. Joey, give me the key. I have to help him, if I can. - You can't help him. - Daddy? - [Eugene] What's going on in there? - Daddy, call the police. - It's alright, it's alright! I'll take care of it. - Hello? Hello? - Hello, Mr. St. Clair. - Who is this? This is Joe Dobson, Mr. St. Clair. Remember me? - Joe? Dobson? You're supposed to be in-- - I know where I'm supposed to be. That's not where I'm at. I'm up here. In your house with Dinah. - Daddy, he's killed Michael and he's got him jamming the elevator door! - I didn't kill him. I just, I just, I just, see he was trying to stop me from seeing Dinah. He wouldn't let me come up and see her and, I wanted to. - Daddy, please help! - Alright Joe, I'm sending my personal bodyguard up there to take you into custody. As soon as I hang up here, I'm calling the police. - You can't do that, Mr. St. Clair. - [Eugene] Can't I? Watch me. We'll use the stairs. - I wouldn't if I were you, Mr. St. Clair. You see, I locked the fire door and I stacked 40 pounds of dynamite against it. If you or anyone else tries breaking it open, you'll blow the top floor of this building right across the city. (slow, dramatic jazzy music) - [Eugene] Dinah, hang on honey. I'll get you out of it. (people chattering) - [Officer] Just keep moving, get aboard the bus. Get aboard the bus. There may be a bomb in the building. We're checking it out. If there is, we'll look at it, don't worry. Come on along, sweetheart. (beeping) (rapid beeping) (officers chattering) - Excuse me, captain? I wanted to tell you the set up. This line is outside. This is a direct line to Commissioner Warner. This is the fire department. Emergency squad and hospital. And this goes into the penthouse. Now there are three lines into the penthouse. I've patched all of them into this one phone and this amplifier. Pick up this receiver and you make contact with all three lines in there at once. Same thing going the other way. Any line they pick up will be heard on this speaker. - Okay great. I'll need another amp and a couple of other phones on the roof, too. - No problem. (officers chattering) - Are you in charge here, officer? - Yes, sir. I'm Captain Mundy. - Eugene St. Clair. What's being done here, captain? Do you have any kind of time frame when I can expect to see my daughter again? - I think it would be better if you stayed downstairs, sir. - If there's going to be shooting, then I'm staying. That's my daughter over there. - Captain Bundy. - [Captain] Who are you? Nick Valeri, hostage negotiating squad. - Do you have a rank, Valeri? - Sure, lieutenant. - Lieutenant. Alright, lieutenant. If and when we make contact with Dobson, you can negotiate with him. So far he's got all the phones off the hook. Hey wait a minute. Don't I know you? Yeah, that jumper on the west side bank building. - That's right. Cavanaugh. His wife left him and he lost his job. - Yeah. After all your talking, he jumped anyway. - Correct, captain. The minute you sent your man out after him. - I sent my man because your talk wasn't working. - Well I remember is while I was talking to him he was at the top of the building and not at the bottom. You mind if I set my loud speaker up here? - Go right ahead. Just don't get in the way. - I won't get in your way if you don't get in mine. - What? - Whoa, Captain Mundy, do you have a make on Dobson? I was told you have one. - Three years ago, he pushed a young woman out of a 22nd story window in Portland. He's been locked up ever since. - Lieutenant, you and I should probably talk. I knew Joe Dobson very well when he was a youngster. - This is Eugene St. Clar, lieutenant. - Yes, sir. My oldest is crazy about JD Convoy. He's on your record label, isn't he? - You get my daughter out of there, and I'll get your son an autographed copy of every record JD ever made for us. - Thank you sir. Actually, it's my daughter. - Then you must be able to understand how I feel right now. With Dinah over there with that... - Sir, I sure can't. Does Dinah know about the woman in Portland? - No. No way she could have handled that kind of information. It would have upset her too much. - Does she get upset easily? - She's a sensitive girl. She's young. - Yes, sir. But if she had that information it might help her to understand how much danger she's really in. - Look at you. You're worn out. Why don't you just go to bed? - I don't think so, Joey. - Well why not? Nothing can happen. I'll take care of you. - You're just not getting it, are you? We're not kids playing make believe anymore. We're not in our secret hide out imagining the lives ahead of us. You've broken into my home. You killed a man. And now you're holding me hostage. - No, I'm not holding you hostage. - Then let me go. Let me just walk out of here. Will you do that, Joey? Will you let me just walk out of here? - I can't. - Why not, if you say you love me? - I do love you. That's why I can't let you go. - Why? - 'Cause you wouldn't come back. (officers chattering) - What is happening there? - Do you think he went there for sex? - I don't know, he was just a kid. - Well he's not now, is he? I've been in situations like this. Unpredictable psychos. - So what are you gonna do? - We can send in men through trap doors and elevator housings and roof, but-- - But we have to assume that if we do anything to provoke him, he may become violent. Our chance is going to come when he picks up that phone and talks to us. Just a minute. (sighing) (officers chattering) - Why don't you go to bed, Joey? - No. I gotta take care of things. - [Nick] Joe Dobson? This is Nick Valeri. If you ever need to talk to anyone, Joe, I'm right here and I'd be happy to discuss just about anything that's on your mind. Joe? I'm right here, just across the street. If there's anything you need, all you have to do is pick up a phone, Joe. Joe, just pick up a phone. Any phone will do it. - Joey, why don't you just talk to the man? What have you got to lose? - Are you kidding? He's just a cop. - [Nick] Joe? Joe? This is Nick. They sent me here to talk to you Joe, but it seems that all your phones are unplugged. Joe? - Hey, you, what's your name, Nick? Hey, hello, big mouth, you called me, remember? (officers chattering) - Hello, Joe? I'm real glad you called, Joe. - So what are you, Nick, a cop? How many guns you got over there pointing at me, Nick? - Oh yes, Joe, I work for the police department. But I'm not that kind of a cop. I don't carry a gun. My job is to resolve emergencies like this one. - Yeah, well, let me tell you somethin' Nick. That foghorn you got over there really bothers me. So what do you say you quit it, huh? We're getting ready to go to bed over here and we'd really like to get some sleep so what do you say you cool it, huh. Disconnect, disappear? - Okay, Joe. Okay. We'd all like to get a little sleep, but before we do that, Joe, I need to know, is there anything you need? - You mean like a million dollars? - Okay, Joe, a million dollars? We can do that. Mr. St. Clair's willing to give you a million dollars, Joe. Now that's how bad he wants his daughter back. - Well he can't have her back. I've got her. - I know that, Joe, I know that. You're calling the shots here, Joe. We all know that. - A million dollars? For real? - That's right, Joe. A million dollars. That's a lot of money, right? And Joe, you wouldn't have to give up Dinah. Not right away. - I wouldn't? - No, no. The way it would work, Joe, is this. Now I would bring a million dollars over in a police helicopter, and I'd give you the money, and you and Dinah would get into the helicopter, fly to the airport, and all you have to do is to promise that when you get to your destination, you let Dinah go so that she can get on the jet and come back home. That sound fair? - Hey, that's a great plan. Who thought of that plan? A million dollars, eh? So, do you shoot me here, or wait 'till we get to the airport? (slow, melancholy music) - No, Joe. It's not like that, Joe. - I saw that movie, too, pinhead. What an idiot. (slow, melancholy music) Which way is the bedroom? (slow, melancholy music) Oh, Dinah. Oh no. This place, it's, I mean it's magical. It's the land of Oz. The wizard's gonna walk right in here and say hello. (laughing) All the times I thought about it, I never got it right. You could live here forever and never have to go out. I mean, you'd never want to. Look at this place. Hey, that's you and Zanita, right? You used to be best friends. - We still are. - Remember we used to hide underneath the stairs and you, me, and Zanita, and we'd listen to the grown ups running around the house looking for us? But Zanita would always give us away by laughing out loud. She always did. (laughing) Remember that? - That only happened one time, Joey. - Yeah. I guess I just thought about it a million times. Oh, look at this. How many floors up is this? - Over 100 a think. - Yeah? I love it. It's King Kong. (grumbling) (laughing) See what you can do when you've got enough time on your hands? On your hands. (chuckling) (slow, dramatic music) The light this thing gives off. What does it make you think about when you're near enough to feel it go into you? Into your face. Into your body. - [Dinah] You tell me. - Doesn't it make you think about another place? Where it's different? Where everybody's different because they know they are a part of each other and everything is a part of the biggest thing of all. The biggest thing of all. (soft tinkling music) Come on, let's pray. (soft tinkling music) Dear world. Dear universe. And all the other universes we don't know about yet. Thank you for giving us each other and for making our lives together so magical. And so much fun. (chuckling) Oh, hello, Abercrombie. (chuckling) I remember you. What? Oh. You're real tired? Had a long day, he didn't get much rest. I think our little Abercrombie wants to go beddy byes. What do you say? Come on. (slow, dramatic music) Is that your side? Go on. Lay down. (slow, dramatic music) (soft tinkling music) (people chattering) - When are we gonna send in the SWAT team? - [Woman] What's your plan of attack? - We gotta see some action here. - [Woman] Have you made any contact with her? (people chattering) - [Man] Commissioner, we got some kind of mad man here. - [Woman] Who is this person? - [Man] We need some answers. (officers chattering) - Oh James. Thank god you're here. - I'm gonna do everything I can Eugene. I know this is a nightmare for you. - Please, get my daughter out of there. - Just a second. Alright, gentlemen, what's the status here? Have you been able to make contact with him? - Yes, sir, I've talked with him, but we're at a disadvantage. All he wants is the girl and he's got her so basically we have nothing to trade. - Yeah, so offering him a million bucks wasn't such a hot idea. - Could we please, please, do something? Hell, I'll give the million dollars to the man here who can go in and waste that bastard. James, you can't tell me that with all the fire power you've got here, and the resources of the police department, there's not some way? - My men are ready to go in at any time, commissioner. You just have to give the order. - You seem to be on top of things here Mundy. I'm here if you need me. - A million dollars. A million dollars to the man who can get my daughter out of there. - Take it easy, Eugene, please. Valeri, Captain Munday. Are you really out of options? - I have one thing left to work with, sir, and I'd like to hang onto that as long as I can. - What's that? - Time. - If we owe that girl anything, it's patience. All we have to do is to hold on and sooner or later, we will get a break. - You don't know that. - Dobson may suddenly want out. That has happened before. - He could want out of this life, and take my daughter with him. He pushed a girl off a tall building in Portland. His mother fell from a height. He himself is obsessed with death by falling. That's why they had to lock him up. What more do you need to know? Do something! - I'd sure feel better if we did. - Remember when we were gonna have our own band? You were gonna be the lead singer and I was gonna play the drums? I wonder what happened to my drums. My aunt probably threw them out after I left. Or sold 'ems more like it. What were we gonna call ourselves? I said what were we gonna call ourselves? Our band? There's a lot of stuff I don't remember. Like important stuff. It must be the treatments. - What treatments, Joey? - Mr. Mayor? - [Mayor] What's going on there, Warner? I don't like this. - I know sir. I'm not too happy with the situation myself. But I can assure you, we have things well in hand. - [Mayor] Have you made any decisions? - No, sir, not yet. - [Mayor] Why not? - We have several options. It's a matter of choosing the one that'll give us the best chance-- - [Mayor] Several options? You're avoiding my question. - No sir. I am not avoiding your question, sir, it's just that I don't feel it's appropriate right-- - [Mayor] Do you know how important Mr. St. Clair is to me and my administration? - Yes I am aware of that sir. Mr. St. Clair is a friend of mine too and if-- - [Mayor] I don't wanna hear about your friendship with St. Clair. I wanna know-- - May I make a suggestion, Mr. Mayor, that we cut this conversation short? Because I've got a slot to do here. - [Mayor] Okay but you'd better let me know-- - Thank you sir. (siren blaring) - People who jump, everyone thinks they're trying to kill themselves but they're not. At first they're afraid of dying. But then when they jump, and they're flying, they're smiling. They're always smiling. My mother was always smiling 'cause she knew the secret. - What secret, Joey? - She went without me. But we'll go together. What's going on? What happened? How long was I sleeping? - Look at that. It's him, I got him dead. - Roy, we've got a shot over here. (officers chattering) - Where's the girl? - We can't see her. - Can I take him, sir? - Is it a go, Roy? - Dammit, I said where's the girl? - I think she's not in the room. - You think? - We can't be certain. - I can drop him right now, sir. - Your decision, Mundy. - No go. She could be hit by flying glass, no go! - He's gone. (officers sighing) (helicopter whirring) (slow, dramatic music) (sighing) (slow, dramatic music) (water running) (slow, dramatic music) - I'm just gonna take a shower. Be a good girl now. (slow, dramatic music) (Joe singing) (Dinah gasping) (Joe singing) (dramatic music) (keys jangling) (slow, dramatic music) (keys dropping) (dramatic music) (groaning) Dinah? Ole! (dramatic music) (Joe singing) Ole! Gracias, senorita. (dramatic music) Dinah, no, don't leave me! Please! - No! No! (dramatic music) - I thought you left me. I can't ever let you leave me again. Please! - No! (Dinah sobbing) (door slamming) No, not the door, don't lock it, please. (dramatic music) We can't stay here, can't you see that? - I know, I know we can't stay. We gotta leave. We'll leave together. - When Joey? When will we leave? - I'll know when. - How? How will we leave? - The way my mother left, that's how. (dramatic music) (slow, soft music) No. No, no. (dramatic music) (grunting) (slow, dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) (blowing) - Joe Dobson? Joe Dobson? You feel like talking to me, Joe? Joe, how are you feeling today? This is Nick. Joe Dobson. Joe? Why don't you pick up a phone and tell me how you're doing, Joe? This is Nick. Nick Valeri, remember? We talked before? Joe? Why don't you pick up a phone and tell me how you're doing Joe? If you feel like talking Joe, it's okay with me. Joe? - Joe Dobson, this is Dinah's father. I know you love Dinah. I know you always did when you were kids. And I respect that. I really do. But you see, I've been away in New York and I haven't seen my daughter for several days. So, how about putting her on the phone so she can tell me she's okay? How about it, Joe? We were all like a family once. And you were a part of it. How about it? - Shut up the foghorn, shut it up, will ya? Everything's fine here and then you start up with the honking. - Joe? Gee, I'm sorry about that, Joe. I really am. But if we can't reach you by phone, we don't have much choice, do we? - How about you people just going home and leaving us alone? It's what we both want. You're not gonna do any good waiting around for days and days until the end. - Okay, Joe. But first, how about letting Dinah's father say a few words to her? Tell her that he loves her. Now you don't have anything against letting her feel good, do you Joe? How about it? - How about it? How about it? I'm calling the shots here, remember? - Absolutely, Joe, you're calling the shots. - Okay. I'll do better. I'll put her in a window so you can all take a look. How about that? - Window? Oh my. (dramatic music) - Come on. (dramatic music) - There she is, she's okay. - Dinah? Can you hear me? - I've got a shot, captain. I've got a shot. - She's in front of him, what are you talking about? - I'm telling you, I've got him. - Wait a minute. She may move out of the way. - Has Joe harmed you in any way? Has he hurt you at all? - "Has he hurt you?" What makes him think I'm gonna hurt you? I love you, don't they know that? What's the matter with people? I love you. I love you. I love you more than anyone in the world, I always have. Like my mother. I love you. I love you! Why don't they understand? (vase shattering) (dramatic music) - So what do we do now, gentlemen? - The same thing we have been doing. The hardest thing of all, waiting. - The situation is deteriorating over there. He could pull the plug any time. - I honest to god do not know what we're waiting for. - Commissioner? Commissioner, this is Sargent Art Steziak, he's my best man. Sergeant Steziak has had special training in hostage rescue operations. - You think you can help us out, Steziak? - Yes, sir. If you can drop me from a chopper, I can get in over there. - How? - That's the easy part. - Alright, once you're in, what then? - It'd be a matter of stalking, sir. Room to room. - I'm pretty sure he's armed. - Yes, sir. The security's guard's gun, a Smith & Wesson .38 special. I don't see that as a problem. - And what about the girl? Dinah? You go barging in there, what's to keep Dobson from killing her? Or you from killing her for that matter? - I think you're out of order, Nick. - Sergeant. Do you feel confident that you can go in there and bring my daughter out safely? - Yes, sir. Totally confident. - Excuse us a moment. Roy? Nick? (officers chattering) Well, what do you think? - Steziak's good. - Good? He's as crazy as Dobson. - If you can't take it easy, Nick, I'm going to have to relieve you. - Sir, you send that hot dog in there, I guarantee you the top of that building will come flying right off. - Lieutenant, what did I just say? If you can't cool it, you're out. You got that? Sergeant Steziak, I want you to stand by. I want you ready to move at a moment's notice if and when we feel an emergency situation exists over there. - Excuse me. Do I understand you to be saying that the situation over there is not an emergency situation? - I'm ready any time, sir. (plate clattering) - Come on honey, you got to eat. - I'm not hungry. - Well you'll get sick if you don't eat. What's the matter? You don't like my cooking? - I can't eat when I feel like this Joey. - Feel like what? What's the matter? - This is no good. It isn't gonna work. We cannot stay locked up here like this. - Why not? - For one thing, we'll run out of food. - We'll send out for a pizza. - And how is the pizza man gonna get in? - Isn't this great? Doing whatever we want. Breakfast at two o'clock in the morning. I love it. - Joey? - Uh huh? - Are you still planning to kill me? (slow, soft music) - What a horrible thing to say. It's not gonna be like that. - Then how's it gonna be? Going away, that's all. (rattling) (slow, soft music) - That's okay. But you don't have to kill me first. (slow, soft music) Why don't you marry me? - What did you say? - We could get married. I'd like that, wouldn't you? - You said you loved me. You told me that. - Yes. So why don't you marry me, Joey? - It's no good, I can't. - Why not? - 'Cause... 'Cause there's something wrong with me. - I know. - You know? - You told me, remember? - I did? I don't remember. - And you're keeping me prisoner here. And that's wrong. - I know. I know, I'm sorry, but everything will get straightened out when we leave here, you'll see. - When we leave? When will that be, Joey? - Don't be scared. - I'll try not to be. - There's no need. We're gonna be together for always like we used to say when we were little. Always. (slow, dramatic music) Always. (slow, dramatic music) (officer coughing) - [Man] Yes, of course. - [Officer] Coffee, guys. - Well he says he needs more time. Mhm. Well, that remains to be seen. By morning. We should know something. Mhm. Well as soon as we can. Yeah. Sure. - So is this how it's going to end? After all these years. I've been there for her since the day her mother walked out on both of us. That girl is my life. I've been through everything with her. She's never had to feel alone. I went to every damned high school play she had a couple of lines in. I lost my voice yelling at volley ball games. And when she fell off that horse, I thought my life was coming to an end. I told myself that if she didn't recover, I wouldn't either. I've nursed her through the chicken pox, the flu, anything a little girl could get. If this is how it ends, I just can't believe it. - [Nick] Don't believe it. (upbeat synth pop rock music) (hitting) - Turn it off. Turn it off! (upbeat synth pop rock music) - What is it? - It's my head. (heavy breathing) Doctor? Doctor, my medicine, please. (grumbling) Okay. Help me. - Joey? Joey, it's Dinah. What can I get ya? - You gotta help me. - What can I do? - Please. - Huh? - Please help me, please! (Dinah yelling) You gotta help me out. No, don't go, please. Please don't go. Look, please, no, no. Don't go, please. Please don't go, please. Please. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright, okay. - What can I do, huh? What can I do? - Please help me, please. Ow. (yelling) - [Dinah] Joey. Joey. Joey? (Joey breathing heavily) (screaming) (dramatic music) (Joey breathing heavily) (slow, dramatic music) (door closing) Hello? Hello? This is Dinah St. Clair. Can you hear me? This is Dinah St. Clair. - Let me talk to her. - No, Eugene don't, let him handle this. Come on, out of here. - Dinah, this is Nick Valeri, we can hear you. Are you alright? - Yes. This is as loud as I can talk. Can you hear me? - Where are you? - I'm in my dad's bathroom. - Where is Joe? - He sort of passed out. He had some sort of attack. Can you help me? I don't know what to do. - Can you get out of the apartment? Can you get to the elevator? - He has the key. - Can she get him to a window? - Can you get it from him? - I tried to. I'm afraid of him. He's really scary. It's like being close to a bomb. - No! - Commissioner, this is a breach of procedure. He has no right to do this. - Miss Sinclair, this is Captain Mundy. Do you think you entice Dobson to show himself at a window? - Why? So you can kill him? - So we can do what experience has taught us to do and what the law allows us to do. You are not involved. - I'm not involved? You want me to lure him to the widow so you can blow his head off and I'm not involved? - For god sake, Dinah, we're trying to save your life. Let go of me, I pay for your damn job. - No sir, not until you calm down. - Was that my father? - You want her to do your job for you. You're asking too much, she's just a kid. - [Nick] I don't agree with you sir. She doesn't sound like it. - Your dad just wants you safe, that's all. - I couldn't do it. I don't want Joey hurt. - If you don't want him hurt, it limits what we can do for you. (dramatic jazzy music) (Joey groaning) (dramatic jazzy music) (sighing) You've got to keep in mind that this man is a seriously disturbed personality. He's already killed twice as far as we know. - Twice? - [Captain] Yes, miss. The security guard you know about, but three years ago, he threw a woman from the top of a building in Portland. - Oh my god. I think he wants to do something like that with me. He's into some other type of reality. - [Captain] Then don't tie our hands, Miss St. Clair. Help us. - Help you shoot him? (scoffing) You want me to stand back and watch his face as the bullets go into his body? I grew up with Joey! - Come on, give me that. Dinah, don't let him hear you. - No. No, he mustn't hear me. (dramatic jazzy music) I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. But you've got to save us both. And that's all there is to it. - Okay, I think we can do that. Now listen to me, Dinah. The night before last, Joe indicated that you might be going to bed together. Did you? - [Dinah] Yes. - [Nick] Was there sex? - No. That is, it was closeness. Like the stuff you do when you're a kid. We did the stuff we did when we were kids. It wasn't like being with a grown man. - Was that okay with you? - He thinks he loves me. - [Nick] Do you love him? - I used to. I care about him. What happened to Joey isn't his fault. - Okay. You go on letting him think that he's in love with you. You let him love you so much that he will do anything you say and then you tell him that you want out. - Why? Have you given up? - No Dinah, far from it. Dinah, you see, in my job, I get to know people by listening to them talk and I feel I know you a little already. Now I have every confidence that you are going to play your part in this. - Which is? (slow, dramatic music) - You say that he is out of touch with what's going on. Try to get him to see the difference between what is real and what isn't, and jolt him out of it. Dinah? Dinah? - I don't know. But it's nice to talk to someone. What did you say your name was? - [Joe] Dinah! Dinah! - Dinah! - Dinah? - That's it, Steziak, you're on. - Yes, sir. - No, wait. - I'm sorry, Nick, you're out of it now. (dramatic music) - [Joe] Dinah! (grunting) (hitting) - Couldn't you have just knocked for Pete's sake? I mean, it is a bathroom, isn't it? Huh? Don't people usually knock? (chuckling) (laughing) (laughing) (dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) (dramatic music) You aren't feeling well, are you, Joey? - No. I don't know why. - Joey? I've got to tell you something, and I want you to try to understand, because it's real. It's the true situation here. - I don't know what happened to me. - Are you listening to me, Joey? - What did you say? - The fact is, we can't go on like this. You've got to get it into your head that the only way we can leave here together, the way you want, and be together, is through the front door, and into the elevator out there. - Leave together? Yes. You're right. Now is the time for us to leave together. - Okay. Then give me the key to the front door. - We're not going that way. - There's no other way out of here. - Yes there is. The best way. The way my mother left. - Your mother was killed, Joey. - You'll like my mother. You're a lot like her. That's why you and I love each other so much. - Your mother's dead. She's dead. - I know that. You think I don't know it? - Then how am I gonna meet her? - By going where she is. - She isn't anywhere. She's dead. - Come on, we're going. - No. Joey, stop it. Stop it! No, Joey please. Please. Please, please. No. - Don't make me do this. Don't make me send you first. We're going together like we always said we would. Together, for always. - No, Joey. If we go out there and we jump, we won't be together for always. We'll be squashed and broken on the sidewalk with our brains splattered all over the road. We won't be flying anywhere together. We'll picked up in pieces and stuffed into two body bags. Don't you understand that? - You don't know what I know. My secret. The power of our love for each other. Come on, Dinah! - No. No. - Come on! - No, no! No! No! (Dinah screaming) (dramatic music) - Together. - I don't love you. I hate you. (dramatic music) Even when we were children together, I hated you. I was glad my father broke us apart 'cause then I didn't have to tell you how much I hated you. Do you really think you're handsome? Do you really think any woman, any woman could love you? What makes you think any woman, any woman, would want to be with you for always? (dramatic music) Come with me, Joey. (slow, dramatic music) Now take out the key and open the door. Then we can go out together, Joey. Together, the way you want. Joey. Open the door. (slow, dramatic music) (door opening) (slow, dramatic music) Joey. I didn't mean those things I said. I'm sorry. - No. I thought you didn't. - No. No! (gunshot) (dramatic music) (gunshot) (dramatic music) Joey, no! No Joey, please. No. Don't. Don't. - [Joe] Let me go. Let me go! - [Dinah] No! - Let me go. - No, no, please Joey. No. No. (gunshot) (Joey gasping) No! - [Joe] Let me go. - He's pulling you over. Let go. Let go. Let him go. - No! (yelling) (Dinah sobbing) (sirens wailing) - [Woman] Oh there she is now. (people chattering) - [News Woman] Miss St. Clair. Dinah, over here. Any comments, Miss St. Clair? - Not now people. We'll have a statement for you a little later. Please. That's enough, that's enough. Would you give us some room here? Please. (slow, melancholy music) (people chattering) - Baby. Baby. (Dinah sobbing) I guess I can't call you baby anymore. (slow, melancholy music) (slow orchestral music) (MultiCom Jingle)
