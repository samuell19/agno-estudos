Kolkata. The city officially established in 17th century by Job Charnock.. ..has gone through vast change. Like many other cities in the world.. ..the names of the lanes and streets have changed. Big flyovers, shopping malls.. ..old building have been replaced with high-rises. Kolkata which was the capital of India in the past.. ..can't be recognized easily by its own flavor. Despite the changes there are certain neighbourhoods, houses, people and families where the flavor of old Kolkata still exists. In the present times of materialism.. ..the financial condition of such families may have deteriorated.. ..but they haven't got rid of their aristocratic attitude. We'll see two such families and witness their lives. Our film is about them. I mean our story. One of them is the family of Pashupati Ghosh in Chitpur. Let's take a look at the wedding preparations going on there. You've been delaying for long. Give me the expense details. Finally you've got time to come. Boro Ma has fallen asleep in the prayer room. Move aside. Hey! - What? I'll thrash you so hard that you'll forget your profession, priest. Khagen, where are you? Come quickly. Will you finish the decorations after the wedding gets over? I'm doing it. What? I'll slap you hard. No excuses. Excuse me. Is Boro Ma in the prayer room? Yes, go there quickly. Pashupati Ghosh. His ancestors were renowned landlords. He had many properties spread across North Kolkata. In the past they were into the business of stevedore. They used to supply goods to the ships. The business... The business that they ran from Khidderpore dock.. ..has gone for a toss. They gradually kept selling all their land and property.. ..and now they're left only with this house. The Ghosh Mansion. This also can get sold any time. Pashu, tell me something. Isn't Saban also my daughter? - Yes but.. So, I also have the right to do something in her wedding. Isn't it? Listen to me. Nobody plays the shehnai in the weddings these days. Listen to me. Arrange for 'sangeet' (dance and music) function. Oh no! It's a bong wedding. They can't dance wildly like the way they do in hindi films. This is not done. Felu's mother.. - Yes, sir. Call Chor da. - Okay. Has the priest come? - He has just arrived. He came just now? - Yes. I'll fire him today. Listen, send Boro Ma here after she finishes her prayers. Okay. Where's Shibu? - I think he went out. Where did he go? All of you're useless. Go. Let the wedding get over and I'll sack all of them. Why are you so stressed? I must know if the wedding invitation cards have reached or not. Manmatha is also very lazy. He is always busy getting dressed up and practicing music. But he never gets to perform in a show. Forget it. Tell me something. Is Saban my daughter or not? - Again? It was Arjun's job to send the wedding cards. Where's the lazy fellow? Felu's mother, tell me if Saban is my daughter or not. Sir, did you call me? Where do all of you stay? Where is Arjun? - I don't know. Whose job is to supervise the wedding decoration? Whose job is to send the wedding cards? What can Arjun do? Doesn't he have his own work? He has no work. - No.. He smokes marijuana and is busy watching movies. He's useless. - Dad, I'm going out to visit Sapna. Mother is offering prayers. She's blowing the conch shell and can't hear me. Hey Saban, why are you roaming around? Is this the time to roam around? You're going to get married. Come here. Come. Sit here. Look Saban, tell me something. Aren't you also my daughter? Isn't it? I need your suggestion. Forget your dad, he won't say anything. What do you prefer for your wedding? Shehnai or sangeet? None of them. - What do you mean? Why are you wasting your time after such useless things? Useless things? You think my daughter's wedding is something useless? Is 'sangeet' ceremony useless? - Forget your sangeet. Stop it. - let me speak. Keep quite. Saban is also my daughter. - yes. This is a wedding of Ghosh family. Our friends and relatives will attend the wedding. How can it be complete without the sound of shehnai? I'm going to Sapna's house. - Look at her. Don't create problems. Sister.. Boro ma is calling you in the prayer room. What's wrong with you? There's somebody outside. - Who? Shibu, go and check. - Okay. Let's go. Early in the morning you are.. Pashu, tell me something. Isn't Saban my daughter? - Yes. Call brother. Call brother. Keshto da, please leave now. There's a wedding in the family. Everybody is busy. Call him. Please leave now. Let this month pass. Hey! - What's this? Will you decide when I should come? What do you think? Call him. Call brother. Why are you creating unnecessary problems? Sir is busy. Please go. - Hey! Don't act before me. I hail from the theater neighbourhood. I've grown up watching drama rehearsals. It was my dream to be an actor or singer. But, I couldn't be one because of my stammering problem. I provide transport to the theatre companies now. If you act smart you'll be in trouble. - Leave me. C'mon go in. Borda. - Hey Borda! Borda! Hey Borda! Hey Borda! I told you.. Look they're busy working. Move. - Borda! Go upstairs. You're just eating and gaining weight. - Yes. Listen.. - Borda! Khagen! Hey Khagen! - Where are you? Here he is. How dare you enter my house any time? I've to get in if you don't come out. Right? What do you think? Am I a beggar or your enemy? Why are you behaving so rudely? Isn't it? - Yes. I told you that you to vacate the ground floor. I just need a small space to set up my office.. ..and start my transport business. You can take charge of my office and be the manager. Yes. It'll be a source of income. - Yes. Isn't it? - Yes. We'll divide the profit equally. You'll have an income and I also won't have to resort to.. ..hooliganism to earn my livelihood. Isn't it? - Yes. But, you didn't accept my offer. Do know what Mr. Sharma has proposed to do? He'll vacate the house and construct a new building here. I'll get a new office in it. Isn't it? - What? Things have changed. I'm working for Sharma now. What did you understand? - Listen to me. I'll never vacate this house and go. This is my ancestral house. I won't leave this house. Tell Sharma that a petty goon like you can't scare me. Let him send criminals, ministers, MLA, MP, anybody.. ..but I won't vacate the house and go. If you come here again I'll call the police. What are you saying? - Shut up! What do you want Pashu to do? What? You listen to me. This locality is not your personal property. Got it? Hey! - Hold on. This is not only Pashu's house but it's also my house. And talking about money. It's not just Sharma who's rich, I also have money. Return Sharma's money and meet me in my office. The matter is over. Got it? Get lost. Why are you unnecessarily getting involved in this matter? 'Salutations to the lord.' 'May peace be with all.' Yes, sister. Hey Keshto.. Stop it. You've drenched me. Hey.. Go from here. Why are you standing here? Go. - What's this? Let's go, Pashu. Will you go or not? Why are you staring at us? Do your work, scoundrels. Do your work Lazy fellows! I want the pandal to be completed today. The scoundrels just waste time. Where is Arjun? Shibu, come here. Go and get Arjun by any means. He's going to get thrashed by me. I'll beat him badly. Do something. Come with me. Pashu, I'll leave now. Hey! Go from here. Go away from here now. Go. - 'May peace be with you.' Go. Did you get oblation? - Yes. Go home now. You saw a family just now. Pashupati Ghosh's family. There's one more family involved in this story. I told you about two families. Right? Agarwal family. They live in the same neighbourhood. Their houses are located close by. Hey! - Shall I? Pashupati's school friend. His childhood friend. After school.. - Again? Pravin somehow managed to pass school, Finished his education and took over the family business. Arjun! Arjun! Rascal! - Arjun da! Where are you? - Arjun da! This is Pravin Agarwal's house. He has a business of fireworks. He has a shop in Burrabazar. Suresh Chandra Agarwal became a millionaire.. ..by manufacturing crackers for Diwali and Kali puja. Hey scoundrel! Why are you shouting? Arjun is not at home. He has gone to work. Yes, I know he has gone to work. I know very well what work he does. He's always drugged. You know everything. Call Manda. Manda can't go down. She's doing the household chores. Listen, what's in your hand? You've started drinking vodka early in the morning. Tell her to stop doing the chores and come down. Manda! Manda! - I told you that she can't go down. Why not? Is she a princess? Who'll do the household chores? You? What a problem! Shibu, do something. Go to Ganesh Talkies. I'm sure he's there. Go. Yes, he goes to Ganesh Talkies because he works there. He works there. I know what work he does. You think he works. There isn't a worse theatre than that in the entire world. Yes. It's a rotten movie theatre. He works for you because you don't take care of that business. You don't have anything better to do. So, you've given him the charge of that dilapidated movie hall. Why are you standing here? Go. - Yes, go. Go and find him. go. Quick. He starts with his drama early in the morning. She always keeps complaining. Yes. Keep drinking vodka from early morning. Manda! Hey Manda! Well, I was saying.. Pravin's father Anil Chandra Agarwal.. ..suddenly decided to start a new business along with the fireworks business. What business? Business of film making. That was a good idea. You know the typical Bengali films with songs and action. He invested a lot of money in one such a Bengali film. You won't believe me, it didn't do well. Then he suddenly thought that he would build a cinema hall.. ..where he would show the films produced by him. Ganesh Talkies was built. He also set up a small film distribution office. But, today when multiplexes are in vogue. Do you know what the condition of Ganesh Talkies is? It's like a fish whose scales have been removed. What's up? You are hardly seen these days. Why didn't you come in the morning? Did you plan anything to get out of here? Forget about the plans, let me.. Leave me. I'll tell everybody. You'll be thrashed so badly that you'll forget your father's name. Scoundrel! Oh my darling! But before that you know what I'll do. I told you to leave me. Have you ever thought what will happen if anybody catches us? Crazy man! Listen.. let's go to Naihati. You'll live like a queen there. Naihati? Yesterday you promised to take me to Mumbai.. ..and now you're talking about Naihati? O my darling! Love has no address. Both Naihati and Mumbai are the same. Will you watch 'Dirty Picture'? - No. Why not? I would love to watch 'Saheb Biwi aur Gangster'. Randeep Hooda. He's awesome. Hooda? - hmm.. Come to the terrace at 3 in the noon or I'll thrash you badly. Please make a plan to elope from here first. Elope.. There's a wedding in the family. Got it? We need money before we elope. Let me arrange some money first. Uncle called from Naihati. I'll get a job there. Let me save some money and then.. Get cutlet for me. - Cutlet? I'll take you to Grand Hotel for a treat. Let everything be finalized first. Manda! - Coming. Manda, come. Listen, I'll leave now. I've to find Arjun. Shall I go? My darling! They can't do any work properly. I'm not getting the account details of ten boxes. Look at him. he's busy pasting labels since morning. He's busy sticking labels. - It'll get done. Hey! Where's Arjun? - I don't know. Arjun! "This life is very beautiful." "The world is so lovely." "But, I don't have anyone like you, my dear." "This life is very beautiful." "The world is so lovely." "But, I don't have anyone like you, my dear." "I don't know where I'll find you." "There's romance everywhere, my dear." "My eyes look for you \in the lanes and cities." "My eyes look for you in the lanes and cities." "I don't know where I'll find you." "There's romance everywhere, my dear." Naskar.. - What's up? Where's Chorda? - Chorda? He went out in his bicycle. He went out? - Yes. "I don't know where I'm going and why." "My heart is lost." "My eyes look somewhere, my destination is elsewhere." "Yet I'm sure to reach my destination." "I don't know where I'm going and why." "My heart is lost." "My eyes look somewhere, my destination is elsewhere." "Yet I'm sure to reach my destination." "My heart races ahead.' "It's the season of union." "I don't know where I'll find you." "There's romance everywhere, my dear." "This life is very beautiful." "The world is so lovely." "But, I don't have anyone like you, my dear." "I don't know where I'll find you." "There's romance everywhere, my dear." "My eyes look for you in the lanes and cities." "My eyes look for you in the lanes and cities." "I don't know where I'll find you." "There's romance everywhere, my dear." Hey! Where were you all this while? Finally you got time to come here. There has been lot of problems since morning. Brother is scolding me as the pandal is still incomplete. Don't worry, uncle. I've spoken to Bhim. If the pandal isn't completed by tonight, he won't get a penny. The wedding won't take place if the pandal isn't finished. Forget about the payment. We've to get it done by today by any means. When will the kitchen set-up be arranged? What about the cook and the cooking arrangements? We heard that all the cards didn't reach on time. My dear son, I couldn't practice singing properly.. ..for the last three days. Please look into these details. Brother is making me go crazy. Arjun, come and have the oblation. Coming, auntie. Hey.. who'll supervise the pandal work? He's off to have oblation. Hey! Who is getting married? Your niece or Arjun's niece? I'm taking care of everything, brother. I'm taking care of all the arrangements. Everything will be fine. There's a show in Chandannagore next month so.. Shut up! You won't perform in any show now. Don't you care for your prestige and reputation? We've a wedding in our house. Arjun is family. Don't get involved in unnecessary things. Brother.. - Greetings, brother. Greetings. I wanted to speak with you. - Yes. Yes, tell me. Let's go to my chamber. Go and tell your sister-in-law that brother has come. Please come. - Yes. Here you are. I've finished offering prayers. Come and take oblation. Greetings, auntie. You don't have to touch my feet, crazy boy. Take this. Seek blessings from the deity first. Hail to Lord. Arjun, you've to go when the wedding gifts are taken. Manmatha won't be able to manage. There are lots of trays. It'll really be helpful if you go with him. Did you see Saban's wedding jewelry? Come. I'll show you. Wow! Lovely! Sit here. - Wonderful! I couldn't buy anything for her wedding. This set was given to her by her grandmother. Take a look. And this jewelry was gifted to me by my mother on my wedding. How is it? It's awesome, auntie. Lovely! I'm relaxed because you're here to help us. After all it's a daughter's wedding. We've to look into so many arrangements. Is it possible for your uncle to singlehandedly manage everything? Mother, I'm going to Sapna's house. I'm showing him your wedding jewelry. Come here. I've to go to her house. Why are you roaming around? Tell Sapna to come here . How is it, Arjun? Super duper, auntie. Let me show you one more. I've been invited for lunch at Sapna's house. What? Your auntie Gouri traveled a long distance to come here. Won't you have lunch with them? Why did they have to come today? Other friends are also going to be at Sapna's place. We planned this long back. I'm leaving. Arjun, try to convince her. She can't roam around like this. - Wow! Your would be husband is coming from America tomorrow. Go to the parlor and groom yourself. But instead of that you always keep roaming around. We haven't bought your wedding reception sari yet. I planned to go shopping with Gouri and you. We don't have time. - Why are you getting stressed, auntie? Your daughter is crazy. We've lot of pending work. - You can go for shopping. Why are you dragging me into all this? Who is getting married? Who will wear the sari? Arjun, talk to her. She is grown up now. Auntie, she is crazy. Sister-in-law, I've finished chopping the vegetables. The cook won't start unless you give him instructions. Okay, I'll go. Try to convince Saban, sister-in-law. Why did she have to go to Sapna's house today? You.. Can't you recognize him? He's Arjun, the son of your elder brother's friend. Hello, auntie. Don't you remember that his father and your brother were school friends? Yes. Now I remember. - You can't recognize him as he has grown up now. He lives in our neighbourhood now. He's like family. He's taking care of all the details. Is it? - Yes. Handling the pandal workers, sending the invitations.. Sir is calling you downstairs. Saban's future in-laws are here. Oh! Is it? Why didn't you inform me? Listen to me. - Yes. Take out the sweets from the refrigerator and send juice for them. okay. Arjun, come down with Saban immediately. Alright. - Let's go. He'll reach Kolkata tonight . In fact he has already boarded the flight. Okay. - He got leave so he is coming early. He'll come via Dubai. - That's great. We don't have enough time. He'll go back after the reception. He'll go to Japan for a couple of days on his way back. That'll also be their honeymoon. But, earlier you said that he would stay back for two weeks. He's very busy. He's always busy with work. When we visited him last time.. ..he booked train and bus tickets for us.. ..and told us to go for outings on our own. He was busy with his office work. But, how can old people like us manage alone? So, we stayed at home. He has a beautiful house. The locality is also very nice. It's located atop a mountain. Hello, sister. Please be seated. - I'm here again. My son wants to interact with your daughter before the wedding. That's great. So, he's coming early. I'm here to inform you. That's good. The people who are getting married.. ..should interact and get to know each other. They're the young generation, you know their thoughts are different. No. That's not bad. It's good. Last time they couldn't interact properly. Our times were different. We didn't see or meet each other. We accepted the partner we got on the wedding day. Daughter-in-law! Come and sit here. I was saying that.. Let Nicky come here and spend time with her in our house. Why should they go out? No. Let them decide this matter. - Yes. Daughter-in-law, where will you go with your fiancée? Anywhere he wants to go. That's not done. He doesn't know the city of Kolkata well. You've to decide on the place. - Yes, tell him. A nice place. How about Taj Bengal? - Yes. That's a good idea. Nicky will love the place. He's right. Who are you, my son? He's Arjun. - Arjun? He's like my son. My friend's son. - Okay. He lives in our neighbourhood. - Okay. Arjun, please go with them. What if they face any problems? No.. no.. my son has a pleasant personality. She won't have any problem with him. I'll tell Nicky to come tomorrow. - Okay. Around 11 in the morning. Okay. Fine. Are you a Bong? - No, actually I'm Mero, a Marwari. His father and I are childhood friends. Both of us were students of Hare School. When I was in standard four his father was in standard one. His father is in charge of all the wedding arrangements. Let me discuss something important. I'll leave now. - Okay. They'll meet at 11 tomorrow morning. Nicky is very punctual. Got it? Saban, you won't go out anywhere now. Arjun, don't let her go out. I was saying that.. You're taking the car? - yeah. I want to go to South City. I told you. It's okay, Neha. You can go there in the evening. What do you mean? There's a sale going on there . I need to pick up stuff for my friends. I told you. - Do that in the evening. What do you mean by do that in the evening? Look at the way you speak to me. Every time you come to India, you're just so rude. Yeah, when in Rome be like the Romans. Rome? Bloody ape! Ape? You called me ape? This ape is going to take care of you. - No. Leave me. I don't like this. Leave me. I said leave me. - Chote! Brother. Chote.. - Yes, brother. Are you going out? Yes, I plan to go out. Okay. Do something before that. - Yeah. I've spoken to the driver. He'll take you to the decorator. I told him long back but he hasn't finished the pandal yet. But, the pandal is going to be constructed at their place. Right? No.. that's the pandal meant for meals. The wedding pandal will be built in our premises. You know what they call it in Bengali.. the 'chadnatola'. It'll be built here. - okay. Okay? - Sure. Got it. Brother, I'll do this work but before that I've a meeting with a builder. I've some work.. Builder? No.. - Please be seated, brother. Be seated. - No, its okay. Please be seated. - No, it's okay. What do you want to say? The matter is that I've been planning for a long time.. ..to start a business in Kolkata. Business? - Yes. Real estate is the in thing these days. I wish we could get a small property. So well.. - No.. that's okay.. But what about your job in America? Brother, that is there. Will Dolly take care of the building business? No. No, brother. It's not building. It's real estate. Actually.. - I've a great business plan in my mind. If I get a space of around1500-200 square feet in any complex.. ..we can start a restaurant. A vegetarian restaurant. Pasta. Burger. Macaroni. We can have an all American vegetarian restaurant.. ..for the first time in Calcutta. It's going to be brilliant. And restaurant business is highly profitable. We'll earn in cash, brother. Isn't it, Navin? No.. if you want to get into business... ..then you can get involved in the family business. You deal in fireworks, brother. I don't think Dolly can handle that. And in any case the noise pollution act is coming down the pipe. That's going to be very hard. So, what's the future of fireworks? As far as Ganesh Talkies is concerned.. ..I think we're done. I think we should sell it to somebody like Inox. Multiplexes are ruling the roost, brother. Please understand. No.. Dolly, are you going to cook? No, brother. We'll hire cooks. We'll have a staff of 10-12. Okay. I can't understand anything right now. We'll discuss it later. Okay? You're going to be here for a month. Isn't it? Yes, brother. Don't worry about it. Don't forget to speak with the decorator. Okay? Absolutely. Not a problem. Chaya! You should've told him the whole truth. What are you waiting for? - All in good time. Yeah. All in good time. Let me handle this. Please, Navin. Please leave me. Please don't trouble me. Go and finish your job quickly.. - Listen.. ..and send the car for me. - Calm down. what are you.. Listen.. I need my own car. Pravin Agarwal's brother, Navin. He lives in America with his wife Dolly. His manners are westernized. But he forgets everything during the winters. He takes leave and comes to Kolkata with his wife. Do you know what the people in the neighbourhood address him as? Jack da. Jack dada, you need to start a business to stay in Kolkata. And I need the house. Try to convince Pashupati Ghosh. Please try to convince your elder brother if possible. Talk to them personally. But, this matter needs to be sorted out by next month. I'm ready to give them a penthouse in Rajarhat.. ..on the terrace. The entire thing. If we get that house then I'll give you the top floor of the shopping mall.. ..run your restaurant, full ownership. I hear you, my friend. But, brother and Pashupati da are childhood friends. I've seen many such friendships. 'Friendship and love for each other.' Mr. Pravin tried to remake a film on friendship but it flopped terribly. Nobody cares for such emotions these days. Cinema. Let me ask you something? Have you ever planned to make films? I do many things, bro. Nowadays it's not enough to survive on one business. The main mantra of business is diversity. Today I'm into one business, tomorrow it may be something else. The one that will do well will stay and that doesn't work.. ..will be thrown out. Use and thrown. - Really? Use and throw. Right? Cinema is also use and throw? Why do you want to resign from your lucrative job.. ..in America and settle down here? - Why? Well, I.. Because Kolkata is market now. Right now a growing city. There are political disturbances.. ..yet I want to do business here. Land is cheap, labour is cheap. I'll shift when the market and opportunities shift elsewhere. Man-market. Did you think of it? Not really. I.. You understand and know everything. I've such connections that I can pressurize Pashupati.. ..in such a way that he will be helpless. But, you're a gentleman. The goons can't work the way you can. Ganesh.. - yes. He'll help you with whatever you need. Start the work today itself. Sir.. - Yes. Good luck. - Thank you. C'mon, scoundrel. Come on. You trouble us every day. Come. Leave me. Please leave me. - Come. Don't speak a word. Shut up. Please leave me. My glasses.. Sir.. sir.. sir, please forgive me. I'm very poor. "The mood isn't good."

Chaya said that she'll give her diamond set to Saban. This is not done. Right? She told me about it today. I refused to accept it but she was not ready to listen to me. She kept saying that Saban is also her daughter. She may be like her daughter but I can't accept.. ..such an expensive jewelry set. She's not giving it to you. She's gifting it to Saban. - So what? Brother Pravin is bearing all the wedding expenses. How can I accept the diamond set from her after all this? Isn't it embarrassing? - I don't have any such feelings. Yes, I can see that. I'm really surprised. Will you ever be able to return the money brother Pravin.. ..is spending on the wedding? I won't. I don't have anything to say. Don't say anything. Chaya is more than a sister to me. Yet she's gifting her an expensive diamond set.. I can't accept it. When I was in fourth standard he was in first standard. Pravin never brought lunch from home. His father's business was on the verge of collapsing. I would carry two lunch boxes to school. One vegetarian and the other one non-vegetarian. Mother would cook for him. This went on for months. Every evening he would come to our house on the pretext.. ..of doing homework and feast on delicacies. Mother would cook vegetarian meal separately for him. When we would go for outings.. ..father would make Pravin sit in the front sit next to him. He taught Pravin how to drive a car. I learned it from him but after many years. Blood relations aren't always important. Don't you see how Manmatha is? He's an idiot. He's rehearsing again. He'll make me crazy. Will you stop? He's disturbing everybody in the neighbourhood. He's irritating. He thinks he's a great singer. Disgusting! What will we do in this huge house after Saban's wedding? Well, I wanted to say.. ..Mr. Sharma promised to give you the top floor flat in a complex in Rajarhat Four bedrooms. One prayer room. We can also have a garden on the terrace if we want to. Do you know what everybody says? There's no pollution in Rajarhat? It's full of greenery. There's going to be a swimming pool in that complex. Do you want to wear swimming costume at this age? Don't divert the topic. Have you seen the condition of the bathroom in our house? It's infested with lizards and cockroaches. It's so slippery that anybody will fall and have a fracture any day. Everything is made of marble there. There's going to be a bathtub in the bathroom. We'll get to meet many people there. There's a park right in front of that complex. We can go there for evening walks. Don't you wish to live a life like this? If you don't go for walks at this age, then when will you? Listen.. please listen to me.. If you agree we can shift there next year. Please call Mr. Sharma and speak with him. I won't say a word on this topic. Live in this haunted dilapidated house. I hate talking to you. I'll go to America after Saban's wedding. In swimming costume. Slowly. Did you drink milk? - Yes. Look at this Manda. Look at this. I was talking about it. Isn't it beautiful? - It's beautiful. Red one is beautiful. - I saw a same one in the market. This must be very expensive. Yes, it will be. You didn't answer my questions. - What? What have you decided about Arjun? What is he going to do? - What? He'll be fine. - But how? He has a future. I also have dreams and desires. Isn't it? A new bride will come home. She'll roam around in the house all decked up. Do something. Sell Ganesh Talkies to Mr. Sharma. They'll build a multiplex or a mall there. Yes, and he'll be the mall's manager. He won't even get the job of a security guard. I'll take him to my office. He'll help me in the business after marriage. No, he won't. How can you plan such things? Even his father will do it. Leave it. Look, I know Arjun very well. He's not interested in business. He has been interested in music since childhood. He bought a guitar for himself and you.. Look, everyone is not meant for jobs or business. Do something. Sell Ganesh Talkies. Send him to Mumbai that you'll get after selling it. What's the harm if he makes a name for himself there? He may become a renowned singer. There are many schools in Mumbai offering.. ..music, dancing and acting lessons.. - Stop reading Filmfare magazine. Why? Don't you wish that your son does well in life? Will he become the next Kishore Kumar? He can. Many young girls and boys appear on the television shows.. Tell me the name of the shows.. Sa Re Ga Ma.. - Yes. Indian Idol. - Yes. Hey you, get out. - Go. Arjun can become a junior artist and nothing else. Don't you feel ashamed of doubting your son's abilities? After all he's your son. - Yes. I'm saying this because he's my son. I know what he's capable of. He wants to be a singer. People have to struggle a lot in the film industry. He'll have to struggle more than me. Then let him sell crackers. Yes, he'll sell crackers. I sell crackers. My father sold crackers. My grandfather sold crackers. The money we earn comes after selling crackers. Cracker seller? Why did he invest so much money in such a terrible film? The film wasn't bad. - Yes, it was. It was a remake of a famous film. It was a classical film. The director wasn't good. Hire a good director and make a nice film. Give Arjun the chance to sing in that film. People don't join family business anymore. Got it? Status also matters these days. Stop reading Stardust magazine. Why are you blaming the magazines? Hi! How do you do? - Hi! So, where do you want to go? How about Park Hotel? - Cool. But, you've to give the directions. - Sure. He will. Hi! Sorry, I didn't get your name. Hi! Arjun. - Hi, Arjun, I'm Nicky Banerjee. Arjun Agarwal. Nicky Banerjee. - Right. Nice to meet you. Okay. Yeah. Right. Welcome to India. Thanks a lot. Please. Okay. Please. Please. So.. yeah.. So see.. it's like this. We haven't really met. We don't know each other. I was thinking that we should get to know each other.. you know before the wedding. It'll make things really easy. You know ease the tension and everything. We can talk to each other over a cup of coffee you know. Get to know each other. You can talk about what you like. I can talk about what I like and.. What do you think? Who should start? You or I me? Cool. I'll start. You know I've been pretty much all over the place. I grew up here. I was in Xavier's till class 6 in Kolkata. I've been pretty much independent after that. So, I went to the States to my maternal uncle's place. I was in Minisodore High School. And then I moved to New York. I stayed in the hostel for a couple of years. And then.. I studied law. Right? So, I went to Boston I was in Harvard Law School. Did my GD there. I don't know, I've been really lucky you know. I was picked up by this biggest law firm in NY and.. ..it's actually the biggest law firm in New York. I work there. I don't know, I guess if everything goes fine for the next 5-6 years.. ..I'm going to move to Washington. That's what I want but I really like upstate New York you know. The drive.. Thanks. You know if you drive from New York to Boston through.. ..New England territory it's really pretty. It's amazing. The drive is awesome. And you're going to love it there, I can tell you that. But.. Cappuccino for ma'am. - You know.. Thanks. I mean no offence meant but Kolkata is really noisy and polluted right.. I mean - Whisky? Hey! - Sorry.. sorry, sir. Oh wow! Yeah, so.. you know you will love it there.. ..though you won't get too much time. I mean ask me, I work really hard. I don't get time to watch TV for example. I love my movies but I just don't get the time. Though frankly, I must tell you. I hate Bollywood, you know. The whole song and dance routine gets to me. It's like a bloody circus. Right? Anyway, so I keep up, I try to keep in shape , you know.. I go to the gym regularly I swim regularly. I like jazz. George Clooney is my favourite actor. My favourite city is Paris. My favourite author is John Steinbeck. And.. oh I love fish. You know I absolutely dig fish you know. Anything remotely fishy and I'm going to lap it up. I mean sea fish, river fish, everything. Freshwater, everything. I can't cook so. So, I kind of hoping you can get there with me and rustle up.. ..something jolly good Bengali food you know. What else? Yeah! I don't smoke. I drink occasionally. I prefer wine. Californian wine. It's really good. You must try it some time. Not whisky like my friend. And yeah.. that's it. that's pretty much.. Oh! one more thing. You're really beautiful Sharbani, I must tell you that. And don't mind my saying so but I think you look pretty awesome in a sari. Right? Yeah. That's it. Your turn. Well, I simply dig my cigarettes. Marijuana too some times. I hate my saris. I think jazz is boring. George Clooney is too boring. I mean I don't want to settle down in a city, state or country.. ..where I don't have roots in. It's like feeling like a tourist all the time. And I don't think I want to settle down with someone who thinks.. ..he can get to know me over a cup of coffee. And I'm definitely not going to rustle up any fish.. ..for any Harvard law school mamma's boy who's not ready.. ..to look beyond the dirt and pollution of Calcutta.. ..and see its culture heritage and beauty. Yup! That's it. I'm sorry. Am I missing something? I didn't get you. She won't marry you. No? No. Then who will she marry? - Marry me. Probably. What is going on? I don't get this. Exactly that's the point. We're here to explain the point to you.. ..so that you get it. No.. is this sort of a freaking joke because it's not funny. What No.. we're not joking. Of course not. See, the thing is.. I'm Arjun Agarwal. Sharbani Ghosh. Something was going on between us for long. What do you mean? Your whisky, sir. - Thank you. What do you mean? We're having an affair. Okay? I haven't shared it with my family and nor has she.. ..because the problem is her father and my father are childhood friends. Like brothers. Now, how will the brothers become relative.. .that's where the freaking problem is. That's where you come. - What.. See, you are the main guy in this plot. The main character, boss. - Just cut the crap please. That's enough. What's going on Sharbani? I'm sorry, I don't get this. After progressing so much.. ..are you playing a prank on me? I mean everyone knows that I'm getting married. All the arrangements have been made. The reception is organized and.. The wedding invitation cards have also been sent out. Do you want somebody to take leave from New York from a firm.. ..and hurl all his ass all the way to Kolkata? Do you've any freaking idea how much a business ticket costs? Of course. When you come via London the ticket costs 500 bucks. You pay 500 dollars. From Dubai it cost 250 dollars. You're the one who buys the 250 one. And what are you talking about? - What? Did you pay 250 dollars for the ticket or not? We have provisions for that. There are 500 dollars for you in there. Two way ticket. Right? No.. screw the tickets, Sharbani.. I mean why.. Why after all the arrangements? The first thing you remembered was the fare.. ..of your flight tickets. Right? No.. no.. screw the ticket. I don't give a flying thing about the ticket. But, you could've told me earlier, Sharbani. I wouldn't have come. I wouldn't have had to take leave. I wouldn't have come. - This is not so easy. We need you. Listen.. - We need you and so you had to come. Listen, please get out of this. Please. It's none of your business and you're getting on my nerves. Let me finish. We need you, friend. You must come. You must come, friend. - Why? Why? how do I.. I need you. I'm the story-teller. I'm trying to explain. Please try to understand. What story are you talking about. See.. her family, my family going through lot of shit.. There is lot of problem. We're unable to tell them about our affair. Got it? So, we were waiting for you. You'll come and meet her father and explain it to him. You'll say that you don't like the girl. 'I don't like her. She's not fit for me.' 'She's not modern. She wears weird clothes. This and that.' You came here from America for a girl. You're here for a girl whom you can marry. She's not the one for you, man. You just have to tell him that. It's just that. But.. but the catch is.. you've to go with a very decent.. ..and cool mind. You'll go very calmly and talk to him very coolly.. ..and try to convince him that you can't marry her. That's it. You're your mamma's boy and you'll go back to her.. .New York and all that.. And then we'll handle things here. It's so simple, man. Why do I have to be involved in your shit? You're from Harvard law School, total professional presentation. Try to understand. I don't believe this. This is unbelievable. What the crap! - Listen to the details first. After that you can fight. Pashu! Hey Pashu! Come down. Come down, scoundrel. If you've the courage then come down and talk to me. You backstabbed me. Scoundrel! Hey Pashu! Come down. - Chorda.. Chorda, calm down. Shut up, scoundrel. How can we handle all this if you also act irrational? Call him. call your brother. Pashu, what do you want? What do you want? You want my money? My wealth? My property? What do you want? Tell me. - Listen to me.. You could've told me. How dare you use your daughter? He wants to keep Arjun with him as stay-at-home son-in-law. He wants to keep Arjun with him after their marriage. Listen to me, Chorda. - Hey Pashu! Come down. Come down. Lower your voice. Speak softly. Don't think that everybody is as degraded as you. Degraded? I'm degraded? Mind your language. I'm drunk. Let me warn you. What will you do? Beat me? What have you done, Pashu? Tell me. What have you done? We were old friends.. But you've ruined our friendship. You didn't trust me. I always trusted you. Every time. What did you want? My business? My money? You could've told me once. You could've told me. I would give away everything with a smile on my face. Everything. I would give you my property wealth, everything. Will you all please stop? This has been going on for long. I don't understand what's happening. The entire neighbourhood can hear you fight. Brother, come upstairs with me. Come. We won't discuss anything now. We'll discuss everything later. None of you are in your senses now. Come with me. Come. No. - Manmatha, please help him go upstairs. Chorda, let's go upstairs. - No. Come. - No.. no.. I won't go. I won't go. I won't go. Please come. He's my brother. Look what my brother has done. Stop this drama. Get out of here. Get out. Answer me first. - Chorda, please calm down. What answers do you want? What? Didn't I tell you to keep quiet? - Shut up! You're showing off your wealth? Brother, don't do this. Here's your money. Take it. - What are you doing? Borda, you.. Don't say anything. I'll return every penny you've given me till date. Get out of here. Get out from my house. - Enough of all this. Brother-in-law, please come upstairs with me. Don't listen to him. - Get out. Don't get angry. - Come upstairs. Don't go away. Brother-in-law.. - Please listen.. He's drunk since morning. Don't mind his words. He's showing off his money? The old stories in old Kolkata have got stalled for the time being. The wedding preparations that were going on has suddenly.. ..come to standstill. Tell me something. They may be good friends.. ..but can a Marwari guy be the son-in-law of an aristocratic Bengali family? Or can a Bengali bride get married into an orthodox.. ..Marwari family and cook fish in that house? What do you think? Can they do it? In the mean time Pravin Agarwal's brother from America.. ..Navin, the one who's standing up there. Navin has come to take a look at Ganesh Talkies. There are few other people with him. The business associates of promoter Mr. Sharma. After overhearing their conversation I've reached the conclusion that.. ..they're going to replace.. ..Ganesh Talkies with a newly constructed multiplex. If that happens.. well, it's my personal opinion.. ..it'll actually be good if it happens. Do you know why? That's because there are hardly any footfalls in this movie theatre? If they build a multiplex here, they'll screen different kinds of movies.. ..for example 'Autograph' or 'Bhooter Bhabisyat' or.. ..'Antaheen'. ..'Antaheen'. The people of this neighbourhood will get to enjoy these good movies.. ..and so will I. Mr. Naskar, don't worry about anything. You won't face any problem.. ..if a multiplex is built here or the name is changed. You'll have a job. Okay? Sir, please take care of me. - They'll come. Help them. Okay. Bye. Stay well. Arjun! Arjun! Where are you? Is this what you planned to do? Did you plan to do this? Do you want to live with them? Do you want to stay with them after marriage? Will you eat fish? Uncle.. - Shut up! Move. Stay away from him. Anglo-Indian! Can't you hear? Can't you? Are you deaf? Are you deaf? I stay in this house because I like it. The day I feel that I don't like staying here, I'll leave right away. Then get out. I won't wait for your orders. So, you won't wait. - Yes. I don't stay here because you've given me shelter here. I don't stay here for the peanuts that I get as pocket money.. ..or the simple food that I get here. I won't wait for anyone if I decide to leave. You've gone crazy after taking drugs. Have I lost my mind or have you lost it? It's my helplessness that I stay here. Come on, Arjun. - And your friend Pashu.. Stop it. - Friend.. Your friend Pashu.. - C'mon, Arjun.. I've been seeing you Bragging about Pashu all the time. Pashu, my friend.. let's have a drink. Saban who was your daughter till last night.. ..have been completely forgotten by you. Let it be. Your friend has locked up his daughter in his house. She didn't eat anything since last night. She didn't eat anything since last night. To hell with Pashu. I won't enter the house. If you enter that house then I won't treat you as my son. Got it? I don't care if you don't treat me as your son. Get out of here. You think he'll help. - Stop it, my friend. Leave me. - Yes, leave him. Leave me. - He's drugged all the time. I'm leaving. - Hey! Will you stop loitering around? I won't come back. Saban.. hey Saban.. Please open the door. Please open it. Listen to me. Just look at her. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. Eat something. Please listen to me, Saban. He's your father. He may have said some unpleasant words in a fit of rage. It's normal for father's to reprimand. Why do you've to pay heed to his words? Please open the door. What shall I do now, sister-in-law? I'll go mad. Saban.. Saban, open the door. Shibu, please do something. Brother.. Brother.. Yes, tell me. I know what's hurting you. But, starving is not going to help improve matters. The wedding is scheduled after three days. People will laugh at us. Ghosh family may not have wealth but we've a reputation and prestige. Will Saban ever get a nice groom like Nicky? I visited Mr. Ashok in the morning and apologized to him earnestly. I can't let the wedding be called off. This wedding will definitely take place. Just imagine how ill-mannered Arjun is. As long as I'm alive I won't get my daughter married to Arjun. I may get her married to anybody else but not him. I think they didn't have the courage to tell you or why.. He's a Marwari guy. I'll never get my daughter married to a Marwari guy. But, brother.. I.. Uncle.. Get out. Uncle, I'm going away. I never wanted.. I never wanted to harm you. If anything has.. - I told you to get out of the house. I just wanted to say that Saban is not guilty. She's not guilty. I'm telling you to get out but you won't listen. Bye, auntie. You told me that we'll go to Naihati.. ..where you'll work in your uncle's video parlour. The situation is not good. Let's forget all these for few days. We won't go to Naihati. We'll go straight to Patna. Listen.. My maternal uncle has a hotel in Patna. Yes. I've spoken to him. I'll surely get a job there. Let me arrange some money. Get ready. As soon as I get some money, we'll run away from here. You always keep changing your plans. You're a liar. Listen to me carefully. I may do anything but I'll never leave you. If I've loved anyone truly, it's you. I can't work as a maid anymore, Shibu. I can't do it anymore. Do something. I'm trying. I promised you.. as soon as I get some money, we'll run away. Try to understand my situation. Manda! Coming. I've three offices in Kolkata. But, I like this place. I hope you're not feeling uncomfortable here. - No. Actual work doesn't happen within office walls. When I construct a house or building it's like a baby for me. I love spending my time at the construction site. After three months this building will no longer be mine. The building will be completed. My baby will grow-up. Other families will settle down here. The house will be theirs. I'll go in search of a new baby after that. Ganesh, give him the documents. Order two cups of strong tea. Or would you prefer black coffee? Barista is located close by. No. But brother, you'll need time to read the document in detail. I don't have much time. - Same here. But brother, whatever I do is legal. Read it. When do I have to vacate the house? Today itself if you wish to. Everything in Rajarhat is ready to move in. You can shift any time. Fully-furnished. I'll shift after my daughter's wedding. It'll take a month's time. My wife and brother will go to Rajarhat in the mean time.. ..to take a look at the flat at Rajarhat. Mr. Ghosh, I may do anything but I never betray. I promise you the best. You can't imagine how huge the penthouse in Rajarhat is. Four bedrooms, three bathrooms, One big kitchen space, dining space, A huge drawing room. And a separate chamber for you. A prayer room for sister-in-law. And you also have the entire terrace. There's a garden on the terrace. Where do I have to sign? - Sign all the papers. Ganesh, give sir the bag. Arjun, I suggest that you leave Saban. Nicky will keep Saban happy. She'll be better with him. Oh no! But, Saban must understand this. I'll take care of it. I'll meet Saban and I'll try to convince her. Problems will increase if you are adamant. What's the use of increasing your problems? Will you be able to go away with Saban? You won't be able to do it. You're not that sort. So, no use thinking of doing it. It'll be better if Saban shifts to America. She'll be happy there. It means she'll get married? - Of course. It'll go as planned. What after that? What else? Arjun will take care of the arrangements the way he was doing. What next? What else? Arjun will go there on the wedding night. To attend the wedding? - Yes. What will he wear for the wedding? - What? A red shirt paired with a white coat. Oh no! White coat. Okay. What next? What else? He'll sing songs. Which song? That song. Which song? That song.. -Which song? Tell me which song you're talking about. What happened? Which song? "I'm a stranger here." "I'm a stranger here." "I'm myself." "I'm a stranger here." What next? Everybody will listen to his song. Everybody swill shed tears. Who's the hero? Who is the real hero? Who? - It's Arjun. Saban must understand this. Okay, I'll go to Saban's place. - Okay. But, how will you go there? I wish I could convince the priest somehow. She's not taking any calls and you're planning to.. I know.. I know she's not taking calls. She.. I'll say that I'm Sapna's cousin and enter her house. Are you crazy? They've seen you all roaming together. You'll be thrashed badly if you're caught. I'll give some excuse and enter her house. What excuse will you give? I'll enter the house. - What excuse will you give? Arjun, listen to me. She'll be happy with Nicky. I assure you that she'll be happy. Listen to me. Look, this is not possible. It's impossible. What can you do? You'll elope with her. But where? How long? How? It'll be better if you let the wedding take place. It'll be good for both you and her. If you really love Saban you'll wish her well-being. Right? Let her go to America. Got it? Do something. Let her get married and end the problems. We've had enough. Got it? - Right. Absolutely right. Bravo! You're absolutely right. You've having great fun. Isn't it? Great fun. You're playing carom, singing songs. You're planning what you'll wear for the wedding. You're enjoying a lot. I'm in great trouble and you're in the mood of joking. That's good. Forget it. I'll leave now. Let's go. Stop playing. Let's go. What? Hey listen to me. Listen. What? I've written a letter. Give it to Saban. Okay, I'll give it. Decide what you want to disguise yourself as.. Uncle, aunt, anything. Give any excuse and do it. Okay? Please don't sing songs there. Don't even try. What's this? It's done. Go and do your job. Go. He wants to send her to America. Khagen! Hey Khagen! Khagen! Tie the rope. Hey Khagen! What happened? The wedding will take place day after tomorrow. Is everything ready from your side? - Yes. Sir is calling you. - What? Sir is calling.. Hey! If you don't finish the pandal today, I'll throw you out of here. Sir.. The wedding will take place as per schedule. Go and inform Boro Ma. - Okay. You've always shied away from responsibilities. It's time to take up some responsibilities. Shibu will carry the gifts. The rest is your responsibility. Inform the relatives that the wedding is scheduled.. ..at 7 in the evening. Everything should be carried out properly. Brother.. I was saying.. - What? Won't you speak to Saban? Do your work. No. Arjun is.. I'll never let my daughter get married to a Marwari guy.. ..as long as I'm alive. The same guy was taking care of everything till date, brother. Doing odd jobs and marriage is not the same. Idiot! The only thing I can't do is ruin the reputation of Ghosh family. The relatives have received the wedding card. What will they see when they come here? That the groom has changed. What does the groom do? He runs a cinema hall. The son-in-law of Ghosh family is owner of a cinema hall. My plight is not so miserable yet. Saban is angry right now. She'll also understand everything once she cools down. A Marwari is after all a Marwari. He was your childhood friend. He was bearing all the wedding expenses. He won't bear the expenses anymore. The wedding expenses will be borne by me. But, how will you arrange such a lot of money? You wanted to shift to Rajarhat. Right? I've sold the house. - What? Gouri, get the wedding gifts ready. Shibu will take the gifts tomorrow. This is the fun of living in this city. It's believed that there are few cities which have.. ..such communal diversity. But whenever the question of inter-community marriage.. ..comes up the diversity becomes prominent. You might say.. Hey brother! What's the matter? Get lost. Get out. Hey! Don't smoke. A warning will come up at the bottom. Go out, my son. Go out. Yes! I was saying that.. ..you might say that aren't Muslims getting married to Hindus in Kolkata? Or don't Christians marry Muslims? Of course they do. They definitely do. But tell me truly how many of us would agree.. ..to get a Bengali girl married to a Marwari guy. What? Think of it. What are you up to? Didn't I tell you to go out? Actually, the matter is.. I'm Sapna's brother. - Oh! In that case, I'm Rudraprasad Sengupta. That's not true. - What? I'm actually Sapna's brother. - Oh! There's a letter from Sapna. - Okay. It's very important. - Okay. I've to deliver it. I can do it. No, don't do anything but take me to Saban. Oh! Do you want me to carry you in my arms, brother? Don't you have legs? Isn't it? - No. - Then what? Actually, I don't know anyone here. If I enter suddenly people might misunderstand me. Don't you get me? - Yes. In that case.. Let's go. - Okay. Open the glares when you go inside. - Okay. Let's go. - Okay, let's go. Boro Ma. Boro Ma. What? Guy from Sapna's house has come here. Saban's friend Sapna. He wants to meet her. He has some work with her. Go and tell Saban. Open the glares. Okay. Come. Come with me. Madam.. Madam, Sapna's brother has come with a letter for you. Madam.. Go. Listen, Sapna has sent a letter for you. Shall I say something? - Yes. Arjun will never lie to you. He'll never wish ill for you. I want to meet him. Will you take me? Can you come with me? Then let's go right now. Mother, I'm going to Sapna's house. I'll be back in an hour. Wait, I'll change and come. - Okay. What happened? Khagen, does anybody named Sapna really exist? It's a big neighbourhood. Why won't there be a girl named Sapna? What's your name? - Antony, the Anglo-Indian. - Yes. I'm allowing her to go only for you. Please drop her home safely. You know what's going on everywhere. No auntie, don't worry. I'll drop her home. Bnoro Ma. - Boro ma, I'll drop her home. Don't worry. I'll bring her back. Let's go. I've explained a little to brother. I've met with the builder. I've talked to the guys of the picture theatre.. - Yeah. To the.. Why did you take Sharma's men to the cinema hall? Well.. - Why? Brother, whatever I'm doing has a purpose. You should understand. What shall I understand? What should I understand? Are you going to make a business deal with.. ..a degraded man like Sharma? Why are you losing your temper, brother? I also have rights on Ganesh Talkies. I too have the right to think something about it. And as far as I'm concerned, brother.. ..this is a complete waste of time, money, space, everything. And as a seasoned distributor, brother.. ..You've to understand that single screens don't work these days. We've to do something about it.. ..at the very least we've to modernize it. For that we've to sort of make it a multiplex. We've to sort of have a food court. Shopping mall. To hell with the multiplex and shopping mall. Brother.. You won't be able to handle anything. You came from America. Right? Go back to America. Go and do your job there. Brother, let me explain. He has lost his job in America. And.. we won't go back now. He lost his job. I want to say.. We were not here of so many years and.. ..you handled the business. We're very grateful for that. But, we've come back now. Give us our share in the property. It's a simple calculation. You can handle the business of crackers. Give the cinema hall to him. Navin, take out the power of attorney documents. Brother, we've made a power of attorney. Go through it. If you think it's okay then give us the cinema hall. She is right. After all they also have right on this property. Where is the document? Give it. Your brother will sign it. He'll give you the cinema hall. Isn't it? Won't you give it to them? Don't cry. Give them what they want. Enough. Listen to me. - See, I'm trying to tell you. I said, listen to me. -See, I was just trying to say.. Listen to me. You said what you had to say in that bloody letter of yours. Now you listen to me. You just tried to run away. I want to tell you I'm going to marry Nicky. And you know why? Not because of family pressure or anything. Because you're a coward. How could you say that I'll be happy in America? How could you write that letter? You just thought about yourself. No, I just want to clear it out you know. that's it. Oh! Let's elope. Come on. Let's run away. I'm ready. Saban, I want to tell you that.. You stay out of it. - Okay. Okay. Anyway, don't' worry. I wasn't serious about running away with you. Because you know why? You don't have the guts or the ability. I just came to tell you that I'm marrying Nicky. Not because I love him... ..because we'll love each other. You didn't perhaps love me. Maybe I didn't either. Because you know what? With true love comes responsibility. And you never took that responsibility. You always thought about your parents. They weren't going to get married. We were going to get married. And you never thought about that. Oh! You think so? Don't act smart. You never took responsibility. Alright! O god! -What's going on? Anyway, bye. It was nice knowing you. They're getting married day after tomorrow. There's just a day in between. Have you arranged everything? - What? What do you mean? Naihati, Mumbai or Patna? How can I think of it at this time? -Shibu, don't talk. Listen to me clearly. I won't let you run away. Do you love me or not? You love me. Right? That's it. Now you must plan and take me out of here.. ..or I'll break your legs. Darling, I won't.. - Don't pretend. This is not cinema. This concerns my life. Shibu, I love you a lot. I can't live without you. Do something. We won't get a better chance. This is the only chance to elope from here. Everybody will be busy with the wedding. We won't get a better opportunity, Shibu. Money.. I need money. How will we manage without money? Tell me. Try to understand me. You must think what to arrange and how. You think of it. You've just one day. If you really love me you must prove yourself in a day or.. Or what? I'll kill you. Sister, take this. This is for Saban. What happened? Saban is also my daughter. Isn't it? I've some duties towards her irrespective of.. ..whom she gets married to. Take this. You've to accept this. At least accept it as a blessing from me. Chaya, you may insist a lot but I can't accept it. After what brother-in-law did.. how can I.. I can't. - Why, sister? If I was your own sister could you distance me.. ..for just one quarrel between us? What are you saying, Chaya? What you did for me was more than what.. ..my own sister would've done. Whenever we were in any trouble.. ..you and brother-in-law supported us. - Sister.. You always protected us. I'll never be able to pay you back. But, if your brother finds out.. How will he find out? Imagine that I gave you everything before the differences cropped up. I would've given all this to you for Saban and Nicky's wedding. But the affair with Arjun cropped up and.. Well.. Saban is my daughter and she'll always be my daughter. Can't I gift her this much? Okay, I accept it. But money? No, Chaya. I can't accept money. Not under any circumstance. Listen.. this money is yours and not mine. That's it. Now the decision is yours. One more thing. Your brother-in-law was supposed to buy the wedding sweets. Think that this is for the sweets. But, does brother-in-law know about this? Yes, he does. He sent the money. No.. - Keep quiet. I don't think what is happening is bad. It's not always possible for true love to culminate into marriage. This is the very reason I didn't marry. Now you know. My father.. my father married at the age of 24. Gave birth to three sons and two daughters.. ..and ran his family very well. I'm going to be 38. Believe me.. I never thought of getting married. Do you know why? That's because.. They don't get a better time to call. Hello. Sir.. yes. I'll go immediately. Okay, sir. He never pays me but always keep calling me. What was I saying? Marriage. I was so busy getting people married that I couldn't marry. Why is Manmatha inviting so many friends? Tell him to reduce the numbers. Sir.. Listen. Manmatha I useless. You and Shibu will take the wedding gifts. Okay, sir. Explain everything to Shibu while I.. What do you mean? You also have to take responsibility. Just ringing the bell and taking money won't help. Do some work. Disgusting! What? What's that? Which one? What's that on your head? Get out. Get out. He's trying to act as hero by wearing a wig. Felu's mother.. - Yes. Get lukewarm water for me. I want to gargle. Nonsense! What's this, brother? Borda told me to discuss the payment of sweets with you. Are you going to start practicing music after gargling? Brother, after all it's going to be a wedding night. I must sing properly. Last time at Ronu di's daughter's wedding.. ..people loved the songs I sang on the wedding night. They didn't praise the sweets. This is also work. Does marriage mean only gifts, food and sweets? Music also plays an important role. The music of wedding night. This marks the beginning of married life. What? - Listen to me carefully. "That day we two romanced in the forest.." "..on a swing adorned with flowers." "That day we two romanced in the forest.." "..on a swing adorned with flowers." "Those memories come back occasionally, I can't forget them." "That day we two romanced in the forest.." "..on a swing adorned with flowers." Look, I know that my sense of responsibility is poor. I accept it. But, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. I thought that you'll be happy in America. Now if you say that you're ready to suffer with me.. ..if you say that you'll go away with me and won't care for anything.. ..if you say that you're ready to live with me despite the problems.. .. then I have no problem. I'm ready to elope with you tomorrow. But, you've to live a hard life. Both of us will have to toil hard. I had made a plan since the last few days. I thought that.. I've a friend whose father own a hotel in Missouri. I'll take up a job in the hotel . Job of a receptionist.. or something like that. I've spoken to him. He told me to go there. If you say then we can leave tomorrow. There's no problem. We'll need money for travelling. There are boarding and food expenses there. I've a plan for it. Your wedding jewelry.. Sorry. Oh no! Hold on. Just a minute. Hello, Arjun.. - Yes. I'm confused about the wedding gift part. What? I've forgotten what to say. Why didn't you learn it by heart? I said everything properly. Why didn't you write down, idiot? I wrote it down. Yes, I did. But, I brought the electric bill by mistake instead of that paper. Electric bill? You took an electric bill? Who will say the important things? You tell me and I'll convey it to her. She's right in front of me. Listen, tell her.. Tell me. Okay, listen to me. Tell her that she need not worry. One of your wedding jewelries will be stolen. Don't worry. One of the wedding jewelries will be stolen. Got it? The most important point. Tell her that the jewelry is hers and they'll be stolen for her well-being. Okay. Nothing to worry. The jewelry is yours and they'll be stolen for your well-being. I'm ready to steal for you, Saban. Seriously I'm not lying. I'm ready to steal for you, Saban. Seriously I'm not lying. I'll never lie to you, Saban. And I'm not ashamed of it, Saban. What's the big deal if the jewelry is stolen? When I start earning I'll return the money. Believe me, it's my word. And for you I can loot a bank, forget about jewelry. I can loot a bank for you. And I'm stealing the jewelry which is for you.. ..meant for you, it doesn't make me a thief. Not at least in my eyes. Trust me. Whatever I have, whatever I bet it today.. ..whatever I could, I've betted you. Just for you. Just for the sake of love. Let anyone try to stop me, my dad or anybody else in the world.. I'll do what I've decided. I'll not give it second thought, I swear. I'm not lying. And what people think of me.. ..I don't give a shit about that, you know. I don't give a shit about what people think of me. To hell with them. Saban.. got to decide, man. You've got to decide. I know it's not easy. It's not easy. But one thing, one thing I promise. It's gonna be wonderful. It's gonna be awesome. "You're well aware that my meaningless words filled the air that day." "You're well aware that my meaningless words filled the air that day." "The sky was adorned with your smiles." "That day we two romanced... -Everything will be fine. ...in the forest.." -Let's go. "..on a swing adorned with flowers." Why are you so stressed? Everything will be fine. We're with you. I'll leave now. I'm getting late. Bye. Listen.. I wanted to tell you something. I should've given some gift on your wedding. I had planned to give you a gift but there's a problem. I don't have money. I don't' have money. I have nothing. So, I got an idea yesterday. I had this with me. Somebody had gifted it to me when I was a child. I don't even wear it. It was lying unused. It's made of gold. Keep it. You'll get money for it. You'll get 5000 bucks for it. Keep it. it's going to help. You've lot of expenses. Keep it. It'll help you. I would've given you a wedding gift. This is the gift from me. I don't have anything else right now to gift you. Okay? It'll help you. What happened? Why are you crying? Don't cry like this. What's your problem? You're getting married to Saban. You're getting married to Saban, brother. Don't cry. What happened? Are you okay? Okay? Come on. Come on, buddy. It's okay. "The moon appeared in the sky when I was walking on a full moon night." "I don't know how divine the moment was when we met." "The moon appeared in the sky." "My time is over." "I'll carry the burden of solitude all alone." "My time is over." "I'll carry the burden of solitude all alone." "The strings that I've bound you with.." "..please don't sever the bond." "That day we two romanced in the forest.." "..on a swing adorned with flowers." "That day we two romanced in the forest.." "..on a swing adorned with flowers." Come in. come in. This is the courtyard. You can see that a pandal has been constructed here. You can at least take the measurements. Isn't it? - Yes. Can we go to the terrace? - Terrace? Yes. We can go. We'll be able to get a better idea if we go to the terrace. Okay. Shibu, call brother. We want to go to the terrace. - Go. Go and call him. The wedding is taking place today. Why did you choose this day to come here? We told you to call brother. Brother! Borda! Brother.. What's this? What do you want? Brother, they're Mr. Sharma's men. They've come to take a look at the house.. ..and take measurements. Isn't it? - Yes. It won't take long. It's a matter of an hour. They'll take the measurements and leave. How dare Mr. Sharma do this? How could he send people to measure the place without informing me? Why are you losing your cool, brother? It's hardly going to take them an hour. Get out. Get out right now. What's going on? We've a wedding in the family today. What are you up to? Get out now. It'll hardly take an hour. I can't come later. I told you to go out, Keshto. Get out. Brother, lower your voice. I respect you and so I don't wish to say anything. Isn't it? - Yes. While signing the paper you should've given it a thought. What was written in the paper? The company can send their men any time for work. Why didn't you read it properly? I could've come in the evening. But, the wedding is scheduled in the evening. Isn't it? - Yes. Absolutely right. So, I've come in the morning. Tell Shibu to open the door of the terrace. Tell him. Shibu! Shibu! Hey Shibu! How dare you? I will. Hey! What are you doing? Arjun! Arjun! Come quickly. Quick. Hurry up. Where? There's problem in Saban's house. There's trouble there. - So what? Keshto and his men have come there. They're creating problems. Please try to understand. What are you thinking of? They'll be in trouble, bro. Let's go. Let's go. C'mon, let's go. You'll get out of this house right now. You'll get out right now. -I won't go. We'll follow what's written in the legal documents. You'll give me the keys to the terrace. I'll open the terrace door, measure the area.. ..and then I'll leave. What will you do? What will you do? Borda, this is not going to be good. What are you staring at, brother-in-law? Take your brother inside. Nobody will go anywhere. This house is still mine. Unless I vacate the house.. ..I won't let Sharma or his men enter the house. Go and close the main gate. - Yes. I'll call the police. We'll decide the rest later. Police? You'll call the police? Okay. I'll dial their number. You can speak with them. Hyena, take out the legal document. You don't have to take out anything. You and your men must get out of here right now. Who are you to order me? You need not know. Just get the hell out of here. Okay? What will you do if I don't? Will you also call the police? I'll thrash you. Hyena da, get out of here. So, you want to thrash me? What's going on here? Come on, thrash me. Arjun! Keshto, this is not right. Let me warn you. Sister-in-law.. Keshto, he'll die. What's going on? -Leave him. I've carried him in my arms since childhood. And he wants to thrash me. It's all because of you. Your name is Pashu (animal) and you behave like one. I beat him because of you. Sorry. I feel disturbed. Hyena, c'mon pack up. He spoilt my mood. Let's go. Let's go. come on. Arjun, what are you doing? Arjun.. Tell him to stop. Arjun, please go. Why did you interfere? Leave him. Brother-in-law, please try to stop them. Hey! What's going on? Shibu! Hey Arjun! What's going on? -I said leave him. What are you doing? I'll call the police. Arjun! What's happening? I told you to stop. What are you doing? No! Arjun, go from here. He is not listening. Hey Arjun! Brother-in-law! Shibu! Enough. Leave him. Arjun! Arjun! Get up, you asshole. Hey! Get out of here. Get out. Out. Get out of here. Never step inside this house or I'll shoot you, bastard. Out. Get out. Arjun.. Arjun.. Hey! Where is he? Tell me where he is. Upstairs in the cabin. You're just too much, rascals. How is he? Doctor, how is he now? We can't say anything at the moment. It's a serious injury. He has lost lot of blood. His blood group is very rare. A negative. We don't have blood of this group in stock. Does any of you have this blood group? A negative. What's my blood group? I'm O positive. Will you check my group? We'll need a lot of blood. I think I'm A negative. Will you check it? Mr. Ghoish, are you okay? Hope you're not feeling uneasy. Don't be in a hurry. Take rest and go home in the evening. Lie down and rest for some time. Believe me, I never thought that the story would take.. ..such an unsuspecting turn. But I guessed that the story would turn out to be.. ..like the movies that are screened in Ganesh Talkies How could I? It's because of our locality. The Chitpur locality. Chitpur is famous as theatre locality. It isn't surprising if the end of our story is a dramatic one. What happened? Go upstairs and check if he's alive or dead. Arjun.. marry Saban. Elope with her. Do what you wish to. But, come back. I don't have a son. But I never missed having one. Please forgive me. Arjun, come back. Come back. Come. Come. Please come. Come in. How are you now? How are you feeling now? Come. Come. Please be seated. Where's your elder brother? - he's at home. Have a seat, I'll call him. Sister-in-law. Brother. Ghosh da has come. It's okay. Tell them that their son has regained consciousness. He's fine now. Brother.. How is Arjun? He has regained consciousness. - Thank god. He's in his senses. - That's good. He's fine. Brother.. please be seated. You don't seem to be well. Come. Come. Have a seat. It's your house also. Come. Please. Please eat something. Everybody in my house haven't eaten anything. They must be worried. I'll leave now. Let's go. Please stop him. The work is going at a very slow pace. I want some energy. Come. Come. Come, Mr. Pravin. I knew that I would get to meet you some day even if.. ..it's for a short while. When Mr. Navin told me that you wanted to meet me.. ..I just remembered one thing. Community. You understand what community means. Brother, community.. both are the same. We don't care who's a Bong or a Bihari or Marwari. But community is something different. You wanted to see the deed signed by Pashupati Ghosh. Isn't it? Here it is. This is the deed of the Pashupati mansion. Take a look. I also have the deed of Ganesh Talkies. Mr. Navin told me that you want to check both the deeds in detail. Who is getting the better deal? Huh? Here it is. This is the deed of Ganesh Talkies. No need to sign it now. Take it home. Go through it carefully and then you can sign it. But, let me tell you that this is the best deal. How is your son? I heard that he has come home. Mr. Pravin, changes are bound to happen.. ..even if we don't want them. We'll break the old mansions and build malls there. Isn't it? For example, my dad's dad, I mean my grandfather.. ..he was a farmer in Bihar. My dad sold the land and shifted to Kolkata. I did my graduation from St. Xavier's college. There's a famous song by Bob Dylan. Time that is changing.. It's a famous English song. Have you heard it? A famous Hindi film was made. 'Dosti'. Did you watch it? It was a hit. Super hit. The film featured very nice songs sung by Mohd. Rafi. I made a Bengali remake of that film. 'Bondhu'. But it flopped. Super flop. It didn't work. Ask me why. That's because.. if you don't mind I would say something. It was an old idea. - No.. no.. It's flopped because the Hindi film was the original one. The one I made was fake. What's real and what's fake.. What's old and what's new.. ..you need to understand it. Isn't it? For example, Pashupati's mansion is old for you. But for me it's the original one. And this deed you see here is new for you.. ..but it is fake for me. What are you doing? What are you doing? Look.. listen to me.. you.. What are you doing? Listen to me. This is wrong. This is real friendship. Are you mad? You burnt it? Do you understand what friendship means? Right now I'm making the film that I couldn't make in the past. Dosti (friendship). Navin.. - Yes, brother. This bag contains the full amount of money that you gave to Pashupati. The deal is over now. You've got your money. There's no deal now. The old things will continue. Pashupati's house will remain as it is. Got it? Navin, I've explained him in my language. Now explain to him in your American language. Okay, brother. Well buddy, now you better sign this deed. It's written here that Mr. Pashupati Ghosh owes you nothing. And you owe him nothing. Got it? And one more thing. You're talking a lot about pictures. The picture is kind of becoming clear for me too. Let me tell you something. I was in America. I was out of work. So, I decided to come back to India and make it here. But, this is India. This is India. We've history, culture, traditions. It's a rich and complex society. There are time honoured practices here. Shortcuts don't work here, buddy. There are no shortcuts here. Got it? Well, that's the reason I've decided to take up Ganesh Talkies.. ..as a single screen. I'll build something around that foundation. Have you seen Priya Cinema hall. Something like Priya cinema.. To build something around it that's going to attract a lot of people. Got it? As far as Pashupati house is concerned.. ..you better sign that deed otherwise my brother is.. ..going to make you an offer you can't refuse. What's the offer? It's very simple. Either sign or jump down the terrace. Hyena.. - Yes. - Give the revolver. I've spoken to Pashu da. He'll vacate the ground floor for my office. You won't get his house now. Look for some other property. I'll vacate it. End this matter here. Hyena.. - Yes. What happened? Sign. Sign it. Come on, sign it. Or you'll hear about a young promoter's death.. ..due to an accidental fall from a ten storied building. This Is going to be tomorrow's newspaper headlines. Sad news and bad news. Sign it. "It'll be dawn every morning and night at dusk." "But the time in between will change lot of fates." "The people who're here today won't be here tomorrow." "Surname and address will change." "What is destined will happen." "Changes are bound to happen." "Que sera sera sera." "We'll have to change." "What'll stay and what will not." "Such calculations won't help." "Time is passing." "The heart is decaying." "The world is changing." "Let's change ourselves in the mean time." "Que sera sera sera." Hey you! Come in. Coming. Keshto! What happened? Come. Khagen da, want to have a smoke? Take it quickly. You're offering me smoke? Go. When the story has taken such a big turn.. ..why not let it take another turn. Right? Since I'm narrating the story. Let me fulfill a wish of mine. Right? This story was about a wedding and you've already seen it. There can't be any problem if we've two marriages instead of one. Do you've any problem? No? Okay. Moreover, they disregarded all the auspicious time and all.. ..and they're getting married on the day when.. ..the wedding reception was scheduled. Do you know why? That's because the two families don't want to remove the wedding pandal. Look, since they're going against the rules.. ..let them break some more rules. There is another pair of hero and heroine in the story. Can you see her? She's the second heroine. Let their story also have a happy ending. "It'll be dawn every morning and night at dusk." "But the time in between will change lot of fates." "The people who're here today won't be here tomorrow." "Surname and address will change." "What is destined will happen." "Changes are bound to happen." "Que sera sera sera." "We'll have to change." "What'll stay and what will not." "Such calculations won't help." "Time is passing." "The heart is decaying." "The world is changing." "Let's change ourselves in the mean time." "Que sera sera sera." "Who cares who's Hindu or Japanese or who's dark?" "Who cares for the ailing whom we're tired of?" "Who cares the politics one is involved in?" "Who cares for religion in this short life?" "What is destined will happen." "Changes are bound to happen." "Que sera sera sera." "Today's kingdom won't exist tomorrow." "The one who's a pauper will get the princess in future." "The one who's sick today will be fit tomorrow." "This silly bioscope may be a hit." "What is destined will happen." "Changes are bound to happen." "Que sera sera sera." "We'll have to change." "What'll stay and what will not." "Such calculations won't help." "Time is passing." "The heart is decaying." "The world is changing." "Let's change ourselves in the mean time." "Que sera sera sera." "It'll be dawn every morning and night at dusk." "But the time in between will change lot of fates." "The people who're here today won't be here tomorrow." "Surname and address will change." "What is destined will happen." "Changes are bound to happen." "Que sera sera sera." "Que sera sera sera." "Que sera sera sera."
