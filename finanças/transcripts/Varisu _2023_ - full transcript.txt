What is the matter? Nothing much Tell me anyway I thought- It is your 65th birthday in another 45 days So? I was wondering You didn't let us celebrate your 60th birthday traditionally If we perform this function now it will be good for our family it seems Our astrologer from Chidambaram told me If we conduct this function Did the astrologer also say your youngest son will return? That will never happen in this lifetime! 'Govt has announced a tender only for this mine' And it has got a great potential Our profits will be huge But Too many competitors have lined up Yes, sir To win this tender, Jayaprakash is already ...forming a consortium according to our sources Whatever you intend quoting Specify 25% more than that But our profit will be affected This isn't about profit But related to our identity 'And that is priceless!' See what you've done to that identity 'Past 6 months we've been hearing there's union problem in the Port' What have you been doing? No, dad, I've been trying to solve it Don't try Do it! I shouldn't read this News hereafter Sir, Dr Anand is on the line - Tell him to come home - Okay, sir I don't know what you'll do Come what may we must win this tender What, doctor? You make so many patients wait daily Won't you wait for me one day? 'I have taken all the tests you asked me to' 'Don't prescribe more medicines I already have a pharmacy at home!' What happened? What I suspected is true What did you suspect? Your test result It is positive You are suffering from Pancreatic cancer 4th stage! It's a very dangerous cancer It cannot be treated effectively What are you trying to tell me? Am I going to die? How much more time do I have? 8 months! 10 months Dai, have you told Sudha? Please don't tell her Other than you and me I don't want anyone to know about this Anand Even I don't know how my death will be But when I see the expression on your face I am terrified If you break down I'll collapse and crumble too Didn't you ask me something? What? Your wish That birthday celebration like a wedding Yes Make the necessary arrangements Why did you change your mind all of a sudden? Why not? Can't I say it suddenly? Let's do it [mobile ringing] 'Mummy...!' Tell me, ma Your appa has agreed For what? To celebrate his 65th birthday as a wedding function With whom? Dai...! Oh! Sorry I just thought You still want to marry him a 2nd time after knowing him all these years But why are you sharing it with me? You should attend the function, right? Amma You know how I feel about it I cannot step into that house again Dai...! It has been 7 years 7 years since you left this house Do you know how a mother will feel not seeing her son all these years? Your face Your laughter I'm scared I'll forget all that 'If I look back' We have never celebrated anything together as a family! 'Who knows?' This could very well be the last function in my life! For my sake Come home at least once I understand You won't come Okay Amma...? Who are you, sir? - Who do you want? - 'Amma...!' Why are you screaming? Madam, he has arrived - Who? - Your son Vijay is here "My ear can hear a lullaby so dear" "Has my truth truly come to see me?"

"In the corner of my lips slight a smile lightens with delight" "Will this blessing so dear live a lifetime here?" "I was yearning for countless days to see your innocent baby face" "Now that you're back home, dear I can hear the lilting lullaby in my ear" "I was waiting eagerly to hear the sound of your footsteps here" "I was waiting in right earnest for my lap to be your head-rest" Ria? Do you remember her? Ria was very young then This is your uncle, dear Go and freshen up I'll serve your favorite 'sukiyan' sweet Go So for 7 years waiting for a call to invite you back home ...you were acting pricey Huh? What fancy talk of standing on your own feet! You left as zilch and back as the same zero! Then why speak with such bravado? What, anna? It has been 7 years Your anger towards me hasn't lessened at all? In all these years not a single day has gone without me not missing you Have I committed such a big crime for all of you to hate me in this house? I shouldn't have come here, anna Dai, I didn't mean it deliberately I may have spoken out of anger Even we missed you here Now and then, I think Hey...! What, da? You fell for my line? Aiyo! My dear brother You are prepared to eat dirt for my few sentiment laced dialogs? Not 7 years I didn't miss any of you even for a single second I was enjoying myself What is your problem now? You are worried why I'm back, eh? I'm not here to ask for my share I came for amma's sake I'll go back after the function I'm not here to race with both of you blindfolded Don't be scared Your 'owner' will be looking for you...go...go Bro! Get me a half boiled egg, go Everyday seems to be a royal struggle with these people Dinner ready Dinner ready Dinner ready - Dai! - Dinner ready Din- - Why are you screaming? - Then what? Before I invite everyone here ...my body will become as flat as a lizard! I get it - Won't you change? - Don't flatter me! Feeling very shy That's fine At least is this house better now or still the same? Fat hopes you have! It has gone from bad to worse Look over there Dining table in any house charts out the horoscope of a joint family! Sit down and watch You'll see for yourself Huhn? Really? Let's watch the show "Like this grindstone, o' bride be strong and push troubles aside" "Be inseparable as the stars above Arundati & Vasishta in your love" "Trousseau the daughter-in-law brings is the sound of her toe-rings" [song from soap opera 'Metti Oli'] Cross check those papers and send them Look there #1 entry No need, I'll take care What is this? Describing it like a jail? Of course this is a jail A wealthy jail Your appa is the warden! Why is the first son all alone? Won't my sister-in-law join him? 'I don't know what the problem is' Past 6 months they haven't spoken or even seen each other face to face - Hahn? - Huhm Here comes #2 'What is he looking for?' When your senior anna is at the dining table Your junior anna won't eat with him They will both look like winning race horses to an outsider Only insiders know the truth They beat Tom & Jerry hollow! Baby Come down soon - 'Coming, baby' - Heard that? This is reverse If your sister-in-law is night then your brother is her night dress! They are like hand and glove This big sinner won't eat without his baby boss Serving her 'sambar' Thank you When I'm not here, will you talk the same way about me too? No way How can I tell it to your face?! Hey - Come, eat - Mum-mo! M-O! What are you doing, ma? Past 1 hour, I've been watching They come, eat and go Not one of them asked if you ate? How are you managing in this circus? Come, sit down God help you! Too much! How many times I would have called you to get out of here? This time you come with me Where will I go? A house is just made of brick and mortar Easy to walk out Is family the same? Okay, ma So how much and how long can you put up with this? Why should I put up with a place I like to be in? Everyone here has some flaw or the other I'm not denying it But in this birth This is my family Until now you haven't answered my question No need, don't ask I will ask, I want to know Are you happy here, amma? You just won't understand even if I answer this Eat 'Tell them I don't want' I didn't start this app for those who have everything It is meant for the have-nots I don't want an investor who wants to scrape the bottom of a hungry bowl Tell this to that dimwit What is his name? Aditya Mittal He's not doing any favor to us, okay? I'll call you back What are you up to? Who are you to question me? You are just a guest here Don't think you can take liberties with me Are you trying to save me? I won't let go of that chance even if it is 0.1% Why? I've accepted it I know...I know When you agreed to celebrate this function I knew you've come to terms with it That's for Sudha Until now I haven't fulfilled any of her wishes In my life, this will be The last celebration Why should I worry? I've leaving behind a huge empire I built brick by brick And 2 princes for sons to run it Immediately after the function I'll tell my entire family the truth Until then let Sudha and everyone be happy That's fine Who will be your heir? Million $ question decided? You were chasing me for a long stretch of time Now I have to run behind you, eh? When even your own dad didn't believe in your project and didn't fund you I lent you money 4 billion 2 years ago Now including the interest 5.5 billion I have saved your dad's # in my phone - I presume you know that? - Hey Mukesh Give me some time please I don't want my dad to know about this You bet! You keep dreaming you'll become your dad's heir But if he gets to know all this Your dream won't come true, right? Already I'm hearing rumors Your dad intends making your brother his heir Grapevine news I won't let that happen More than this 5.5 billion If I offer something more lucrative? What is that? How much longer will we meet clandestinely? You are having the cake and eating it too! - Do you really love me? - Hey! How can you even doubt that? Then what? Please wait a bit longer When I become the chairman Then no one can stop me Are you sure? Has your dad named you as his heir? What will you do if he selects your brother? You have no answer for that, do you? Hey Smita Tell me, sir None of the problems there should be snuffed out Keep fuelling the fire I'm following your orders, sir I'll do the needful "Frying pan on the stove piping hot Socket so useless, use not" "Vadivelu Dubai comedy Dodge when your hands are empty" [folk song] Oh! Lubba lubba! Lub-dub lubba! Lubba! What quiet mischief are you up to? - Who is she? - Who is who? July 4th - You went to see a bride for your anna? - Yes - That bride had a sister - Yes You complained to me she couldn't take her eyes off you Abbaa! Why bring up her image in my mind now? That 'her' is this 'she' Which one? This Miss India card and that 'Aadhaar' card are ditto? That '2 plait pretty miss' is roaming with her hair loose What are you braiding now? - Look at my timing? - Why? The short time I intend staying here I was wondering how I can talk to her, hook her, hug and kiss her When she herself is interested in me in this rushing rash way My love track is so easy, no? She has no such interest Only rushes in rashly! She crushed your timing long time ago You are discouraging lovers Who is her lover? I, me, myself! I won't accept it - What? - Make black tea for me Bring it in the right time you claim you're good at Don't talk about timing to me - This is the right way - Ah! Okay 'Didn't I tell you?' My friend's dad is an advocate I spoke to him If you are okay, we'll take the process forward What process? Divorce, akka Did I ask you for help? Should you ask? Seeing is believing You are not happy here You don't even know that? You know it's ages since I saw you smile For the sake of your children and this society You want to sacrifice your life, akka? You have to come out of this hell hole I can't do that You'll never change, will you? "Like thunder and lightning Come, dude, daring and daunting" "Rev up your spirit Dude, go on, do it!" "Fizz it" Baby...babe I think you didn't see me Who are you? Thank God he didn't see this I had the same feeling I didn't recognise you at first either More than before even I have become Smarter and handsome-er! That's why I seem like a stranger to you July 4th Your sister's wedding You got attracted to a boy Yes...Appi Appi...o? Appachan My classmate I used to call him Appi Appi or Tuppy I don't know who Don't you recognise me No, I don't No, uh? 'Black tea' 'On the dot timing' Forget it This is a famous film dialog, 'Love is like a flower to some' 'Once the flower wilts and withers the petals can't be stuck back!' A strong glue can fix it as good as new Why didn't you tell this earlier? I did, no one listened to me Listen to me now That time was her akka's entry here This is the time she wants her akka to exit Oh! Then the issue is my brother and wife not getting along Otherwise she likes me When did I say that? You didn't exactly say so You believe it, right? "Happy birthday to you" "Happy birthday to you" "Happy birthday, dear Harshu" "Happy birthday to you" Hahn? Look, she's looking at me Who? You think so? Move this side I'll make you understand Where is she looking now? Aiyo! Look! She's looking at where I stood No one can beat your timing! Come and stand here I'm better off standing next to that horse Do you want to grab its grass and eat? You always have a quick rejoinder! I hate the sight of him even standing next to you Leave him, akka It's better to leave than carry on like this Correct? Then what? I am yet to see you smile Why torture yourself? More than the fear of living alone after a divorce Feeling terrible living together is even more of a trauma Of course you'll be scared I am not denying it But If you step over that stage You can enjoy a new life At least won't you be happy? Isn't this what you wanted to say? Am I right, da? You'll hit me if I disagree Hmmm...correct Think Think deep Think deep and hard - What, da? - Instead of uniting with that girl You separated her sister from her husband Backfired, right? Your family is already on fire She won't see you Pouting your lips like a baby after messing it up big time 'Excuse me' I thought that girl is calling me even now? Love is really a magical feeling Huhmm...not even mud or clay! - She's right behind you, turn - Really? You said something? Sorry, stuffed my feet into my mouth? No...not at all You'll be I thought you'll also be just like your eldest brother But You are different I was the one who thought you were wrong It's okay if you thought I am wrong But I am glad You 'thought' of me, right?

This house and my company as my heir You have to take the reins [tickled chuckle] You are a pucca businessman, right? When you knew your 2 sons have gone to the dogs you're dragging me in! Into your race Whatever mess you are in is because of the decisions you made But thank you For asking me to get out that day Because the second I stepped out of this house This whole world felt like home with the exception of this house Even that is thanks to you Thank you for the offer, Mr Rajendran Palanisamy Pccht!

I didn't feel like leaving, ma When you stepped out, I was scared I thought I thought that's the last time I'll be seeing you I was leading a royal life thinking all my decisions were right When death opened its jaw at me I understood the complete essence of life The questions death is asking me I have no ready replies All these years I thought I had conquered the world Losing at the home front What is the use of conquering the world? If I walk down memory lane I don't remember any of my achievements Only the mistakes I did stare right into my face 'You are making grave blunders' This was said to my face by... ...only you! If those blunders have to be straightened out Only you can do it Till date I have never asked you anything I am asking you now Will you be by my side? Even this request I'm not asking for my sake I am asking for your mother's sake She has dedicated her entire life to this family Look what I've done to her? Did you see my present plight? The fact that I am dying I can't tell anyone other than you When Anand told me I have just months left I was not scared at all But when I see what's happening around me I am terrified!
