When the people of the world have a common monetary language, completely freed from every government, it will so facilitate and stabilize exchange that peace and prosperity will ensue even without world government. A union of peoples, rather than a union of political governments, is what this world needs. ~E.C Riegel, monetary theorist The New Approach to Freedom 1949 Money as Debt III Evolution Beyond Money The Challenge Life has always been a challenge. When one has a problem and wishes to solve it, first one must determine what is the root cause of the problem. Simple problems have simple solutions, complex problems are, well... more complex. An obvious problem with our current financial system is that it rewards greed and corruption. Greed and corruption seem to be everywhere. But are greed and corruption the root causes of the problem or are they the result of the way the system is built? Logically, one should first ask are there built-in reasons why the system works the way it does, and if there are, can they be built out? Interest Stock & Flow Some say the basic reason the system is unstable, and leads inevitably to corruption, is the charging of interest. As explained earlier in this series, in our current bank credit as money system, the principal amount of a bank loan is simply created from the borrower's promise to pay back the principal plus interest in money. But the money to pay the interest is not created. The obvious, but untrue conclusion, is that it would, therefore, be mathematically impossible to pay off all debts. Many who call for money reform call for the abolition of interest as the solution to the problem. But is interest really the problem? Yes, there would be a serious mathematical shortage if all loans where concurrent and had to be paid back in one lump sum. That problem might apply to gangland loans and sometimes to farm loans, but that's not how the banking system works in general. Bank loans usually get paid back in a series of payments over a period of time, and for good reason. Money is both a stock, the amount in existence at any one time, and a flow, the transactions over time that the money is used for. Flow works like this: if I, the rich guy, lend you a dollar and that was the only dollar in existence, the stock, could you pay me back 100 dollars? Well, if it had to be paid in one lump sum, no. That other 99 dollars, the interest on the loan, would be impossible to pay. It would be impossible to pay even in 2 dollar payments because there's only 1 dollar in existence. But if I let you pay me the 100 dollars in 1 dollar payments, magic happens. In fact, in 1 dollar payments you could pay me back any amount of interest, if you lived long enough. The only condition required to make full payment of a 100 dollar debt with only 1 dollar in existence is that I give you the opportunity to earn, or otherwise get that dollar back, each time you pay it to me. This is the flow. And by means of the flow, the same dollar can be paid any number of times and becomes effectively many dollars, all legitimately representing the work done to earn them. It is always the work the real value that pays the debt and gives the dollar its value, not the dollar itself. The relationship in our example is dreadfully unequal because the man with the money has enslaved the man without it, just like the real-world, some would say. But a simple loan at interest need not produce a shortage of money or cause unpayable debt if flow is 100 percent, as in our example. Flow is the real measure of economic activity. It's much more significant than the stock in the money system because it multiplies the effect of money in circulation. Given that today we use an exclusively debt money system, what is flowing in all these transactions is credit or promises to pay money. This credit is ultimately nothing more than promises of borrowers to pay this credit back, usually according to a time schedule, and usually with interest added. To pay this credit back, most of us will have to work and earn it by being productive. So, therefore, the real value of the money that flows in our economy today is created by our promises of future productive work. We take a loan in order to have something now rather than later. We agree to pay interest on into the future, thus reducing our future spending power, often by more than the amount of the original loan. However, with an understanding of flow, we see that there is no intractable arithmetic problem with the charging of interest. The problem is a social and systemic one. Lenders have neither obligation nor incentive to spend all their interest income so that the borrowers can earn it again and again. In fact, money lent once into existence is lent as existing money a second and a third time in expectation of more gain. The problem is basically one of incomplete recycling, where money needs to be spent, earned and used to extinguish the debt that created it. It is, instead, lent or invested for gain. In other words, money that must be extinguished is, instead, expected to grow forever. Money Lent Twice Here's another simple example of a basic mechanism inherent to all lending. Let's say I lend you 100 dollars and you spend it into circulation. It eventually ends up in the possession of someone who doesn't need to spend it and decides to lend it instead. Now, once again, let's say this is the only 100 dollars in existence. So you have to borrow it from the secondary lender in order to pay off your debt to me. But now you have to borrow it from me to pay the secondary lender. This twice lent money has become a perpetually unpayable debt. This debt can never be extinguished, nor even reduced without a default. Notice that interest doesn't even enter into this equation. The problem of perpetual debt remains, interest or no. And even if the money itself is of intrinsic value, like gold or silver, or if it is issued by governments as cash, twice lent money creates perpetual debt exactly the same way. When the same money is lent at interest, several times simultaneously, not only is the debt perpetual, society as a whole is paying moneylenders multiples of the interest-rate for the use of the same money. There's an expectation that existing money should increase indefinitely by being lent at interest. But thisr equires us to mentally divorce the money from the debt from which it came. However, the reality is, every dollar created today has a scheduled appointment to be extinguished as a principal payment on the loan that created it. And that's why debt money can't be separated from the debt that created it. It's like a yo-yo spun out into circulation in the economy for a while and then pulled back in at the appointed time. In order for the yo-yo to be free to return, all of the debt money needed to extinguish the debt has to be available to be earned. The flow must be complete. Can't we just pay off these debts with other money? But what would other money be? Today, the amount of physical cash and coin in circulation is very small. Almost all money is bank credit, debt money. So, if almost all money comes into existence the same way, then its a valid to picture each debt money dollar as having its own cycle, from creation to destruction. So, the question, can we pay off debts with other money? No, there is no other money! Because all of it is similarly committed to debt, in one form or another. Therefore, the only way to insure current payments can be made is to constantly increase the total amount of money in the system. But more money in a debt money system means more debt, so the debt hole in reality just deepens. Since debt is money in this system, it creates the fantasy of wealth... for a while. But fantasies must come to an end. The day of reckoning can be pushed back but only by passing the debt onto generations yet unborn, which is precisely what we're doing now. Government debt piles up endlessly. Corporate debt piles up, consumer debt too. As long as total debt keeps increasing, the system can stay ahead of the debt monster. But all of this debt is an absurd fantasy that our descendants will surely never repay. Nor would they be advised to, as repayment of debt would eliminate the money stock and plunge the world into a depression. Once real growth levels off due to the inherent limits of human productivity, or the limited resources of a finite planet, this growth dependent money system can only resolve its impossible arithmetic in the destruction of value. This can either happened through a deflationary spiral of credit defaults, falling prices or by the devaluation of the money unit. Taken to extremes, either course of events will destroy an economy and even a civilization. The only other choice is debt forgiveness. In the ancient world, a regular debt jubilee, a society wide forgiveness of debts, was a common practice to deal with these unavoidable problems with lending. It was considered normal, even by the rich and powerful, that the general good of society took precedence over the rights of those rich enough to be lending money for profit. Neither a borrower nor a lender be. ~William Shakespeare, Hamlet Hard Money Some say that the money systems problems would be solved if we returned to using gold for money, or silver, or some other limited or hard commodity like oil or energy in general. They argue that this prevents money from being created in excess and backs it with real value. However, it also makes those who actually possess the selected physical substance the only ones with real money. Everyone else would only have a claim on real money. For instance, gold. How would we ever transition back to a honest gold economy with a natural distribution of gold among the population? That's long gone. And why would we want to do that? The gold based money system is our past, it's how we got to where we are today. Gold is inconvenient, even more so was a barrel of oil. Therefore, whether gold, oil or kumquats, trade will be carried out in promises. The real question is if we are going to trade using promises of delivering something of real value, why gold? In fact, why any single commodity? At this time in our evolution, doesn't this very old idea of money merit serious re-examination? Debts & Promises It can be argued, that our current elastic debt money is backed by real value, every bit as meaningfully as gold. That's because money, most of which is created as mortgages, represents the value of the assets pledged as collateral. So, is bank credit money actually a claim on the real-estate pledged to create it? Not directly. Bank credit money can be a claim on anything. Now, anything includes the real-estate pledged as collateral, so it can be a claim on the real-estate that was pledged to create it. So, how is a promise of real-estate any less valid than a promise of gold? Both gold and real-estate can change value relative to other commodities. Neither is a permanent standard. In fact, there can never be a permanent standard of value because value is always subjective and variable. So, it would seem that the crucial difference between a claim on gold and bank credit is that bank credit is not a claim on any specific real thing, while the promise of gold is. The promise of gold has to be a promise of a specific amount of a specific real thing from a specific promisor. Isn't that the essential reason why many people would consider a promise of gold the better promise? But that is only true if the promise is reliable and what is delivered is really gold. With the discovery that some of the gold bullion sitting in central banks is actually relatively worthless tungsten plated in gold, the whole argument that gold is the most solid reliable money is shown to be neither solid, nor reliable. Precious metal is susceptible to counterfeiting, it's heavy and it's vulnerable to theft. So, to return to commerce via the physical exchange of precious metal coins would mean civilization had reverted to a pre-electronic level of technology. In the absence of such a collapse, the economy would still windup running on promises, just as it does now. So, once again, money would only be as good as the promises made and there would be no need of actual precious metal coins if all transactions were carried out with promises. The VALUE of the coin is the MEASURING UNIT Money is the Measure by which Goods are Valued, the Value by which goods are Exchanged, and in which Contracts are made payable. Every thing receives a Value from its use, and the Value is raised, according to its Quality, Quantity and Demand. Money is not the Value for which Goods are exchanged, but the Value by which they are Exchanged. ~John Law, political economist, 1705 The Fundamental Questions The fundamental question is: What does the need for money, to enable trade, have to do with the amount of some shiny metal there is? Or the amount of any single natural resource or commodity, or real-estate, for that matter? Where is there any meaningful relationship between the functional need for money and any of these things? To answer that question, let's go back in time and find out when money started and why it became what it is today. We know that Stone age people had money. In the Stone age, before writing was invented, money had to be a portable object of value, because that was the only technology available. That's why rare shells and stones, from which jewellery could be made, were ideal as money. A rough standard of value for these money objects developed over large areas, enabling extensive networks of indirect trading. This way people could obtain specialty items not available in their own environment and looked good doing it. The popular concept of jewellery as a store of value has continued to this day. In later agricultural civilizations, cattle were often the standard value objects for large transactions and salt for small ones. Salt was rare in those days and valuable. Roman soldiers were paid in salt, thus the term "salary", meaning payment for services. With the invention of writing, trade and other commodities could be carried out using promises of cattle and salt. The cattle and salt weren't necessarily what was finally delivered. They were just commonly understood units of value in which the real trade goods could be conveniently priced. Written credits were expressed in these two common units, although they represented a variety of real goods and services. This form of money was ideal for local economies, where traders were known to each other and pledges could be collected upon. This voucher redeemable for pottery & tile - potter This voucher redeemable for boats & sails - boat builder Agricultural surpluses allowed some people to leave the farming to others and specialize in particular crafts. This resulted in improved skills and better tools and that led to further gains in productivity. This specialization of labour required increased trade, as more people opted to produce a single item of enhanced value. They would then need to trade their specialty for the broad spectrum of necessities that past generations had produced for themselves. But direct barter was inefficient. So, more trade lead to a greater need for money. Over many centuries, various forms of money where tried. Eventually, gold and silver coins proved to be the most useful money objects because they were conveniently portable, and similarly valued across large areas of the civilized world. They where also easily standardized for weight and purity, and did not require enforcement of value by some authority, nor redemption in goods from someone far away. Thus, for very good reasons, gold and silver became the universally successful international currencies, accepted as final payment of debt almost everywhere. Money as a Single Uniform Commodity The problem with a system in which money is a standard commodity is that it is most efficient when only one standard commodity is used, but if you do that, it makes the value of money exclusively dependent on the quantity of that one commodity in relation to all other commodities. For example, the Spanish thought they would be fabulously wealthy with all the gold they stole from the Aztecs and the Incas and then turned into money back home. But when the gold got back to Europe, sure, the amount of gold increased, but it didn't increase real productivity in proportion. Fertilizer would have been more useful for that. So, because there was no big increase in real stuff to buy with it, the value of gold decreased, and the Spaniards discovered that gold had no absolute money value in itself as many people had imagined it would. Its value was determined by its abundance relative to the value of real goods and services to be bought. Yet, many continue to argue that the value of gold, a luxury item of no practical use to most people, should be the measure of value for all the real goods and services essential to our lives. While some campaign for a return to gold, others mistakenly believe that today's money still does represent gold held in a vault somewhere. That hasn't been true for decades. In our current money system, we use national fiat currencies and bank promises to pay in national currencies as the standard commodity instead of gold. National currencies used to be promises to pay in gold or silver. But way more promises were made than could be honoured... so that system fell apart. Today, national currency is just legally enforced money, what they call "Fiat Money". That is, it's money you have to accept because the government says so. To many, this government fiat money is just worthless paper. But is it really? We can pay our taxes with it, and governments, especially local ones, provide essential services paid for with those taxes, like roads, schools, hospitals, libraries, police and military. So, government fiat money isn't worthless at all. Now, it is true that consumers of government services have no individual free market choice as to what their tax money is spent on and what services they receive. In fact, many taxpayers may not want those services. So, therefore, this money can rightly be accused of being monopolistic, coercive and socialist. But government is coercive, monopolistic and socialist by nature, isn't it? What else should it be? Government in a democracy or a republic is ideally a single authority, empowered by society to enforce laws agreed upon by society for its own collective benefit. In a free market economy, government must provide the level playing field of law within which the free market can function. And it also has to provide the referees to enforce the rules of the game. Those who are nostalgic for the freedom of the frontier should recall that the first thing early settlers usually did was elect a sheriff, and build a jail and collect taxes to pay for both... for good reason. So, government fiat money isn't inherently worthless by nature. Governments at all levels offer vital services in exchange for it. It only becomes worthless when government creates too much of it. Which it often does and for the worst reasons. While many reformers are fixated on the differences between gold and fiat currency, what's more important is the essential similarity. Being single uniform commodities, gold, silver, national currencies and bank credit, all share the characteristic common to moneis for millennia past: the more money there is relative to the real things available to buy, the less the money unit is worth. Thus the total quantity of money in circulation is extremely important to maintaining the general price levels. And today, this quantity is largely determined by the demand for new money to purchase real estate and speculative equities. This makes the supply of money for general trade particularly vulnerable to real estate and stock market bubbles. fantasy wealth real wealth destruction OH NO, IT HAPPENED AGAIN! The Concentration of Wealth Perhaps the most significant problem with money as a single commodity is its tendency to concentrate wealth. Those who have no money must get it from those who have it to lend. Anyone with extra money can lend it at interest and if, rather than spending all of the interest, they add any of it to their lending capital, they will accumulate even more money to lend. One reputable study counted all the ways we pay interest, directly on our own debt, and indirectly in prices and taxes for corporate and government debt. This was compared to the interest we earn from all sources. This study found that only the richest ten percent come out ahead. The next ten percent do little better than break even and the remaining 80% pay more than they receive, the poorest losing out the most. Payment in Money Now, in our current bank credit system, money is created as debt to banks. This debt is required to be repaid to the banks in money, either fiat cash or bank credit. Therefore, the ability of all borrowers to repay depends on the availability of fiat cash or bank credit. The supply fiat cash is controlled by the nation's central bank. But fiat cash makes up only a very small proportion of money. Usually about 95% of all money is bank credit. And who controls the availability of bank credit? The banks?! Well, on the one hand, what the banks can do is constrict the supply of credit anytime they want to, with high interest rates or by just not granting loans. On the other hand, the banks could lower interest rates and encourage borrowing, but, they can't expand the money supply, unless borrowers are willing to borrow. If cautious and reliable borrowers are in short supply, banks must take bigger risks as interest must be paid to depositors and banks cost money to run. The bank credit money supply is, as they say, "highly elastic". And, because its based on the willingness of borrowers to borrow and the reliability of borrowers' credit, it is vulnerable to both rapid expansion and drastic shrinkage. Also, everyone is legally obliged to pay in money. Now, money, in reality, is just an accounting of debt. And accounting follows strict rules. So, the whole situation is governed by inflexible numbers. That's why a sudden shrinkage in the money supply caused by some defaults has the inevitable follow-up effect of causing more and more defaults and even more shrinkage of the money supply. This self reinforcing downwards suction leads us into economic collapse and the economic and social absurdity of unemployed, dispossessed people camping outside their empty, vandalized homes. And what does the government do about it? It loads bankrupt taxpayers with astronomical fantasy debt that will never even be reduced, never mind paid off. A TRILLION used to be a big number Not anymore! The BANK ASSETS lost were PROMISES to pay legal tender the banks NEVER HAD All this is done to fill up the negative balance sheets of the banks with money the banks never had in the first place. Now you, the taxpayer, will pay interest on those ?losses? FOREVER!!! And then they use it to pay themselves obscene bonuses! Life is GOOD... Life is good for those who know how to play the system. when the PROFITS are YOURS... the losses are forced onto the taxpayers The bailout scam was the biggest daylight robbery in the history of the world... so far! and the government puts YOU in charge of making sure it "never happens again"!!! It's the System! All of these tendencies of the money as commodity system are features of the system itself. The greed and corruption comes in as those who understand the system profitably surf the inevitable waves of boom and bust. Those who understand the system know what's coming, and even precipitate it when the time is right for them to take advantage of disastrous mass events for their personal and political gain. But it's the structure of the system itself which gives them the opportunity. Without the wave, there would be no surfing! And they've taken this opportunity over and over again since ancient times. People complain of the injustice, blame each other, blame the Left or the Right or whoever the scapegoat of choice is. But they never really catch on to the reasons this keeps happening. That's because most of us shy away from trying to understand the true nature of money and of freedom. The basis of freedom is essentially the freedom to exchange... goods, services, ideas. If you create something in proven demand, you and only you, should have the right and the freedom to create and spend the credit money needed by someone to buy it. Money as a portable uniform commodity was invented a very long time ago. Pretty stone... maybe good for trade It was the only choice using the technological means available at that time. But times have changed. So why is this outmoded technology still the prevailing concept we have for money? Could we go beyond money as we've known it? Could there be a new basis, a fresh concept, a design that could more effectively address the real purpose of money in the 21st century? "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them. " ~Albert Einstein "I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. ~Albert Einstein Back to Basics Before we can create a better system, we have to believe that another system is even possible. To do that, we need to look at what money does for us, what purpose it plays in our lives, what it does well and what it doesn't. This can be done by asking some fundamental questions about the role and purpose of money. First, what is the one essential purpose of money for which there is no substitute? Buying the things we need and want, right? Direct barter is so cumbersome, and money so versatile and convenient, that money in some form must be considered a necessity for any kind of complex economy. But, except on rare occasions, most of us don't need money to buy gold or silver or real estate, the usual things money systems have been based on. This leads to question two: why can't money be backed by all commodities, instead of a single specific one? Wouldn't that completely change the nature of money and liberate it from the model where money's value derives from its scarcity? Question three: why can't the supply of money be created directly by the day-to-day need for money? If that were the case, the demand for goods and services would create the supply of money needed to purchase those goods and services. Question four: you have to spend money to make money. Now, that's a familiar saying that points to the other essential purpose of money, which is to fund future production. Question four then follows: why should money be a claim on existing things at all? Why can't it be a claim on things yet to be produced? And finally, question five: can we set the bar higher and make money inherently stable and intrinsically moral? Is it possible to create a money system that balances and corrects itself automatically and distributes wealth more fairly? The answer to all of these questions is to eliminate money as a single uniform commodity. Instead, money should be a promise of, or a voucher for a specific amount of any actual thing in demand, whether it exists already or will be produced in the near future. Money would then cease to be a thing in itself and, instead, be simply a unit of measurement for the value of real things, like minutes are for time, meters for length and tons for weight. This idea of vouchers for real things goes all the way back to the invention of writing and numbers and probably preceded the widespread use of coins, but until now was only practical for limited and local use. Our advanced technology, at long last, makes this concept practical for global trade. And there is a growing use of trade vouchers for real products already happening in business-to-business barter networks around the world. Once values can be reconciled by a common unit and transactions carried out using modern technology, there's no longer any need for money as a single uniform commodity. Most money is already just accounting, not a physical thing. Credits used as money could, and probably would, still include vouchers for gold, silver and taxes. But they would also include vouchers for food, clothing, shelter, services, in fact, anything in reliable demand. Money as Vouchers for Goods & Services Money has no value if there's nothing to buy with it. This should be obvious. Therefore, the logical source of money should be the value of the real things we're going to buy with it. That value is ultimately determined by what the customers are willing to exchange for it. Therefore, value is created by demand and money should be also. The bank doesn't lend money In the bank credit system, money is not actually lent, it's created by the borrower as credit towards demand for the borrower's future production, just as this movie is proposing. But the system pretends it's a loan of money and repayment must be in money. The borrower is required to earn both the principal plus the interest in money within a limited time. The alternative is to create credit money directly and simply spend it into existence in the process of production. Like bank credit, this is credit towards the demand for future production to be honored within a limited time. But the credits spent in this system are obligations to be fulfilled with products or services only, there is no debt of money. Full recycling is naturally enforced by the system itself. The money created to produce something must equal the money needed to buy it when it's ready for sale. If this seems novel and strange, that's because the words used in banking have conditioned us to believe that banks lend money. In truth, we self-issue credit now by signing the loan document and pledging our future productivity to repay the so called loan. Our promise of repayment in money is what creates the money and most of us will have to earn the money we repay by producing real goods and services of value to our fellow humans, just as if we had issued our credit directly. In our current system, the bank doesn't actually have the money it creates for us. The bank does, however, validate our self-issued credit by undertaking to lose the amount created if the loan is not repaid. This is called an unfunded liability, a fancy term for gambling money you don't have. Thus, our personal credit becomes both the bank source of income as interest and also a potential loss to the bank. As the bank increases its income, it also increases its potential losses, which it knows it cannot cover. As banks are only required to own assets that cover 4 to 8 % of their potential losses, losses more than that will put the bank out of business and require Deposit Insurance to bail out the failed banks depositors. Like the banks themselves, the Deposit Insurance can only cover a small proportion of its potential losses. So, the burden of saving the system eventually falls on the general taxpayer, the only one who can be compelled by law to take on the bank's gambling losses. The public as a whole must go into debt to create the new money needed to make up for the private liabilities that were unfunded in the first place. We can go on endlessly about the numbers and who did what, completely missing the point. The problem arises because we are enmeshed in imaginary numbers There is no Money... generated by an inhuman, unnatural and ill designed system, only DEBT which has become completely divorced from reality. All payments to the bank must be made in the form of bank credit or fiat cash unforgiving numbers. So, the first difference to note between our proposal of producer issued credit money and bank credit is that where bank credit is payable only in money, self-issued credit is payable only in goods and services. In the first case, if the bank credit borrower fails to pay the bank principal plus interest in money, the bank takes whatever was pledged as collateral. Neither the bank nor the borrower has any means to ensure there is enough money in existence for everyone to pay back their bank credit. And neither party has any control over the value of the collateral either. The collateral may plummet in value and be insufficient to cover the bank's liabilities, causing a book loss and threatening the security of all the bank's depositors. When severe and widespread, this structural problem can bring the entire economy to a screeching halt and mass bankruptcy. This money "lost" is the same money the bank "created" By contrast, with self-issued credit, it's impossible for the promisor to go bankrupt. Why? For the very simple reason that there's no debt of money to a bank. The debt that creates the money is payable in goods and services only. Therefore, a promise of product or service requires the ultimate creditor to purchase from or hire the one making the promise. Now, it would always be possible to be unpopular, unproductive and unemployed that would render an issuer unable to issue credit anymore, no one would accept it. Someone could indeed go out of business. But with self-issued credit, going bankrupt and losing assets pledged as collateral could only happen if the issuer breached its credit contracts by failing to deliver the products or services promised. The supply of these, the credit issuers should have control over. Poor business usually results in excess product, not a shortage. Therefore, a failure to deliver on promised production would have to be the result of some exceptional circumstances, it would not be the normal situation. A Self-Correcting System There's a second difference between our proposed concept of producer-issued credit money and bank credit. The principle of money as a single uniform commodity could be applied to individual producers, rather than to the money supply as a whole. This could be accomplished through an automated market. Why would this be a good idea? Didn't we just show the negative effects of money as a single uniform commodity? The answer is: when the scarce commodity principle is applied to individual credit issuers in a free credit market, the system becomes automatically self-correcting. The scarce commodity principle would force each individual credit issuer, from individuals to corporations to governments to be responsible for spending exactly what they take in, a balanced budget, full recycling of the money. Their success at balancing their budget would determine the relative value of their credit in a free market where credits are exchanged. Perfect parity with the universal value unit could only be achieved by perfect balance of trade. How? By means of a public digital exchange based on some elementary school arithmetic. Take the total volume of offers to buy any credit issue and divide by the total volume of offers to sell. This is not a bargaining session between people to arrive at a price. The price is determined by the demand/supply ratio automatically. This producer-issued credit creates money as demand for actual production and it automatically and relentlessly revalues the issue credit money in real time. This means that the total purchasing power created by the issuer always equals the real current demand for that issuer's purchasing power. Like a claim on gold, there's a specific value in real goods promised and a specific promisor to collect it from. However, this form of money is not a single uniform commodity like gold, it is, instead, the promise of delivery of an unlimited quantity and variety of commodities actually in demand. The value of any given credit is simply what the issuer will give in real goods and services to get its voucher back. Logically, the most reliable credit money would be issued by those whose products are necessities. Producers of energy, food, minerals, raw materials of all kinds, manufactured goods and construction would all be logical choices to issue credit. As well as these foundational issuers, in any given economy there would be third parties using the issuer's credit as money. The more issuers in a community and the healthier their credit, the more abundant the local money supply and the more prosperous the people of that community would be. That money being promises of specific products that set prices would not be subject to revaluation due to the total amount of all credit in circulation. It would be directly affected only by its own internal balance of trade. The productivity of the people and the demand for their production would directly create the spending power available to them without interference from afar. There would never have to be an artificial shortage of money in a local town caused by the financial shenanigans of greedy people in distant cities or countries. The power of money would be localized and made self responsible. In sufficiently productive economies with many successful issuers, there would be more than enough money available to service third-party transactions. In fact, the prices of goods and services in this third-party economy could rise due a local abundance of spending power. As all prices would be in the same unit, local price rises due to abundant money in the third-party economy would be restrained at some point by easy comparison with prices elsewhere. Whether credits as a whole were scarce or abundant in any given community, any given credit would still only be redeemable for exactly what was promised by its issuer, specific goods and services at advertised prices. Savings In this system, savings are simply savings, not loans to a bank. Like gold coins in a berry chest, saved credits would be out of circulation entirely. But unlike gold coins, these credits would also act like bonds. They would provide a yield, interest. Why? Because when someone accepts the issuer's credit as money in exchange for their goods and services, they have extended credit to the issuer. They've traded present value for future value. The credit then gets passed around as money amongst those who will accept it. Then, when the credit matures, which should be within a year, the final customer collects the interest in the form of a predefined return in extra product. In practice, this would take the form of a lower price. Anyone not purchasing with the issuer's own credit money would pay the full price. Buyers of large items and everyone at the wholesale level would always take the trouble to trade for the specific credits they needed, in order to reap all the benefits available. If unredeemed, these credits must expire shortly after maturity, because credits are promises. And promises should not be held over the head of the issuer forever. It's spend 'em or lose 'em. So, how can these expiring credits be saved? Quite simply, really. Maturing credits must be traded in for new ones. This would create an active exchange market, as credits would have to continually flow from those who are saving them to those who wanted to redeem them for the issuer's goods or services. They would have to be replaced in exchange by the newest possible credits that could be saved. This constant trading would accurately determine the real moment-to-moment value of individual credit issues. In addition, this trading would yield truthful and timely insights into the likely realities of future demand. Yes is the Answer To sum up. Yes, there is a simple way to create an exchange system that inherently balances and corrects itself. Yes, this system favors a broad and more equitable distribution of purchasing power, as business success very clearly depends upon spending money, so that potential customers can acquire it. And yes, purchasing power can represent all commodities, not just one. Purchasing power is a promise to deliver anything specific that's in demand, like electricity, steel or carrots. This purchasing power is not money, it's measured in money. Money being a unit of value like minutes, meters and tons. Purchasing power is created and constantly revalued by proven demand for future production. value x quantity = demand Investment Where does the money come from for investment? All money in this system is an investment by its very nature. The acceptance of an issuer's credit in exchange for goods or services now is an investment in goods or services to be delivered in the future. Conceivably, there could be two types of product credit money. One type would be short-term to be used in general circulation as money. This would fund current production. The second type of product credit could be longer-term and higher risk, traded separately to fund long term development. Such long term credit would be redeemable in product, normal credit or equity shares. Shares and equity would continue to be the foundation of investment and dividends to shareholders would be one of the costs of production. Dividend money would also need to be spent or exchanged before it expired, so that the flow of purchasing power to the issuer's customers would be maintained. Profits So, how does one earn a profit? The same way one earns a profit now, by selling production for more than it costs to produce it. However, in this proposed new system, the issuer of credit must maintain a perfect balance of trade for their credit to remain at par. Therefore, taking in more than was spent would just cause a shortage of their credit in the market. This shortage causes the value of that credit to rise, relative to the prices which are expressed in the universal value unit. This sounds good, but it isn't. The issuer's credit is worth more than par when spent, seemingly a benefit to the issuer. However, if an issuer's credit is over par when redeemed for goods or services, it will cost the issuer even more in real goods and services to get it back. Why? Because everything is always priced in the universal unit. With over par credit, the issuer's customers will spend less of that credit to buy the issuer's products than they would have at par. This leaves more of the issuer's credit in circulation, compensating for the shortage automatically. The result is that, if the system has to self-correct, the issuer does not get the potential profit. Instead, it goes to the issuer's customers as an additional bonus. To make a profit, the issuer must spend new credit as required to keep its credit at par. Therefore, we can say that in this system issuer profits could only be realized by spending them immediately, perfect flow. Issuer profits can't be piled up as money in the bank seeking further gain. Profits must flow quickly back into the general economy, where customers can earn that purchasing power again. An employee bonus of immediately redeemable credit would be a fair, popular and effective method of quickly sharing profits to avoid overvaluation. Charitable donations would be, too. Or hiring people to do socially useful non-commercial work, such as environmental cleanup. Technological Displacement People are always losing their jobs to machines. What can be done about that? This proposed system is based on a 100% recycling of purchasing power. Gone is the overhanging debt at interest to banks. Gone are the loan payment schedules. Gone is any possibility of bankruptcy, because there's no bank to rupt. If the issuer wishes to sell X units, the issuer must spend enough credit in the circulation for the customer to buy X units. If a machine replaces a person, it's very clear the issuers must still supply their customers with the purchasing power to buy their production. This is something Henry Ford realized long ago. He paid his workers 3 times the going wage. This enabled them to buy the cars they were building and thus expand the industry. But this essential principle of a successful economy has been forgotten in recent times. Cost-cutting for shareholder profit has savaged the purchasing power of wage-earning consumers. This is suppressed demand bringing on even deeper cost-cutting, offshoring of jobs to cheap labor nations, expanding debts at all level, defaults, bailouts and all the distress we are witnessing. In contrast, this proposed system would require distribution of the full purchasing power to the customers, even if no human employees were required. Mortgages How would mortgages work? Very differently. Builders would issue their own credit, they would not borrow money from a bank. Therefore, there would be no payment schedule and no interest clock to beat in order for the builder to make a profit. Timely delivery of desirable product would be the only commitment the builder would have to meet. Buyers wouldn't borrow from a bank either. Instead, buyers would enter into a partnership agreement with the builder and buy out the builder's share over time. As long as the payments were kept up, the builder would be a silent partner. Subsequent buyers would do likewise. Everyone would be free to negotiate their own pay-as-we-go arrangements, free of any conditions imposed by a bank. Bank-like services could still exist to facilitate these processes, but the pretense of lending money would end. In this mortgage partnership system, no one would lose their equity in any partnership, until what they paid in is paid back out to them. Forfeiting collateral would be a thing of the past. In addition, payments in this system would have what economists call a counter cyclical effect. Here's how it would work: in a growth cycle with a boom in housing, the issuer could gradually increase its credit issue to pay more people to build more houses, because it would have a gradually increasing revenue stream from new sales. On a downturn, the builder must reduce production to meet reduced demand. This means a reduction in new credit issue, but incoming long term payments remain the same, creating an imbalance that will eventually over value the issuer builder's credit. Therefore, the issuer builder must still spend as much as it takes in to maintain its credit at par. To accomplish this, the issuer could pay laid off workers, reduce buyer payments, if requested, invest in a new job creating industry, give to charities, or spend it all foolishly. The point is that by whatever means, the same amount of credit must be spent as is coming in. This amount would only very slowly taper off, as some of the payments finished. This would make long term debts, like mortgages, natural bridges over economic downturns. This would be the opposite to what happens in the current system. In the current bank credit system, the principal is removed from circulation once it's paid to the bank. This money requires a new loan to replace it. If no one's willing to take this loan, the money supply is reduced. If every dollar has been lent multiple times, as in our current situation, the lack of $1.00 in new loans results in an unavoidable shortage of principal with which to pay off multiple loans. In contrast, the self-issued credit must be immediately returned to circulation interest-free, as spending. A decline in the real estate market would still mean fewer jobs building houses. But the possibility of widespread foreclosures and homeless people camping outside of their vandalized homes would be gone. To the house buyer and citizen, the proposed new system offers the following benefits: no one is doomed by the calendar and by the dictates of a bank formula; no one ever loses their equity in any property they've paid for; and no one needs to fear that widespread defaults will result in a deflationary debt spiral or ridiculous bailouts, because in this new self-issued credit system, long-term mortgage payments will provide a natural bridge over economic downturns. Where Do Banks Fit In? Where do banks fit in? Or do they? The answer depends on how the system would be implemented. Technology now allows us to bank online. It's only one step further technologically to make the safekeeping, accounting and money transfer functions of banking obsolete. Money could be securely stored and transferred online from peer-to-peer, directly and anonymously, without any third party involvement, like banks or PayPal. Alternately, banks could function as fee charging service providers and record keepers for the same self-issued credit system applied as an accounting system. And one method does not have to exclude the other, both could exist side-by-side. Banks could also continue to function as lenders. But how could banks be lenders if they could no longer create money and if no one even needed to deposit money? What would banks lend? And why would anyone need loans if they could issue their own credit themselves? Well, for this simple reason: in the self-issued credit system, the vast majority of people and small businesses would not be issuers. Why not? Because personal credit would never be widely acceptable. And most individuals and small businesses would not want the responsibility of being an issuer. Issuers must ultimately back their credit with their assets. Should they breach their contract by failing to deliver the goods or services promised, they could be forced into liquidation to satisfy their creditors. In a large corporation, the equity investors would likely put up more funding to ensure production, as this would be the only way to save their investment. But for individuals without such resources, it could mean selling their homes, because they fell ill or misjudged costs or any number of other reasons. Not a position most people would want to be in. So, while one main goal of this system is to develop a society that would operate from savings rather than debt, there would still be a demand for consumer loans and business loans among non issuers. Loans of existing credit already in circulation could continue to be made on the personal or institutional level, but new credit could only be created by issuers as promises of real products and services. Issuers could lend directly to trusted borrowers, such as employees. Issuers could also supply their credit for banks to lend at interest. These loans of product credit would be repaid with product credit. This product credit would not be redeemed for the issuer's goods and services, but its value would be the same as the credit that was redeemed. This credit would come with an interest charge, just as loans do today. But, unlike conventional interest, flow would always be complete, because both the bank and the issuer would be compelled to spend all of this interest profit immediately, in order to maintain the value of their credit at par. If borrowers defaulted on their payments, this would leave more credit in circulation than was needed to buy the issuer's output. Therefore, the issuer's product credit would be devalued proportionately. This would cause the loan losses to fall directly upon the issuer and also on all the holders of the issuer's now devalued credit. With the viability of their core industry at stake, issuers would surely cut off the bank's supply of product credit (?) at the first sign of lacks lending standards. In this way, banks would be dependent for money on the producers of real wealth, not the other way around. And the money that banks would lend would be real, which is to say redeemable for specific goods and services from specific providers. As for bankers, their essential and beneficial role in this new system would be in moving credit from those who have it to those who want it. Because credits in this system, like bonds, would mature at maximum value, there would be an optimum time to redeem them for goods and services. In other words, a period of maximum yield, like fruit at the peak of ripeness. And, like fruit and other perishable goods, credits in this system also expire. Fruit must be eaten, or it spoils. Product vouchers must be redeemed for product, or become worthless. So, to use this expiry date money as savings would require constant renewal. Ripe credit would have to be repeatedly exchanged for unripe credit. The longest lasting credit would be the newest and so there would be a constant demand from savers for reliable issuer credit that would keep its redemption value. The most desirable credit would be from an issuer who maintains stable prices, as well as consistent parity of credit. Anyone could do this credit trading from their own computer in a matter of minutes. However, there would be a market for professional researchers and brokers who could deliver reliable credit to their individual and corporate clients. And this is where the financial types could do well by doing good. Brokers would be performing three extremely valuable services to society: 1. they would safeguard the value of people's savings; 2. they would help everyone get the maximum redemption value for the credit they've extended; and 3. they would make sure that the issuers got all their credit back. For the system to work for everyone, broker evaluations must be honest. But this would tend to happen naturally, because brokers who sold bad credit would lose their clients. However, it would also be important to insist and establish by law two restrictions: 1. the brokers always be paid by the receivers of credit, not the sellers; and 2. the brokers fees should always be paid in the same mix of credit acquired for the brokers' clients. With these restrictions in place, when brokers move credit from those who have it to those who want it, they would of necessity provide honest credit ratings to their clients. There'd be no advantage in being dishonest. because... Brokers get paid in exactly the same Credits as their clients Insurance, Pensions & the Like Suppose you saved up a hundred million dollars, feel pretty secure... But what if there was almost nothing to buy with it? Now, what would it be worth? What if everyone else had just borrowed a hundred million new dollars into existence and the money supply had become swollen beyond recognition, like now? It's also important to remember that, in a debt money system, all money saved, such as insurance or pension funds, is still someone's debt. The original borrower needs to be able to earn this money in order to pay off the original debt. So, if you invest your savings with an expectation of gain, while the original borrower of the money needs to earn it and extinguish it, there's only one way this can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Both the bank and the borrower can be satisfied if the money invested for gain is ultimately used to employ the borrower, who's then able to pay it back to the bank and retire the debt. As well, you, the investor, can be satisfied if the borrower's labor produces an increase in the money value of your investment. But the real money value in equity can only be created by real economic growth and this can't happen in a sustainable economy where stability is the goal. In a sustainable economy, as in nature, new growth simply replaces that which dies off. Thus, over the system as a whole, the net value of total investments could never increase because of equity growth. Pension funds and insurance would have to rely on dividends and current premiums. But even more fundamentally, we need to understand that we can't eat money. The simple truth is that, in almost every case, current needs must be met from current production. Our future cannot be ensured with saved up money. We can really only ensure that supplies of real goods and services will still be there for us in the future by protecting our environment, by preserving topsoil, protecting species, biodiversity and by stopping war and the poisoning of the planet. The list goes on and on. Taxes What about taxes? If we could all exchange money anonymously, how would the government collect taxes? Wouldn't it be impossible? Everyone is sick of taxes, not so much the principle of paying them, usually. But the complexity and the nuisance of collection and the corrupt and misguided purposes for which the taxes are spent. Most aggravating is the injustice that most of our taxes just pays perpetual interest to bankers on an ever-expanding government debt. In a self-issued credit system, government, like private issuers, would have to maintain its credit at par by operating within a balanced budget. To do that, it would have to collect taxes that equal what it spends. But the problem for government is that existing forms of tax would be very easy to avoid. Imposing such taxes would, therefore, be difficult and expensive. It would also be unfair, because those who complied would be paying for the many who were not. So, what would be the source of taxes? The logical answer would be from things that can't escape to an offshore tax haven. From the private use of that which naturally belongs to us all, usually referred to as the Commons. The Commons means anything that is naturally given to all by the Creator. Bare land, natural resources, water, air and the electromagnetic spectrum, the primary examples. Taxing a common supplies tax at the base of the production process. This way, taxes are included in the price of all goods and services that consume or use the natural Commons. Those who privately consumed or used the natural Commons the most would pay the most towards the common expense of government. But the Commons is not inexhaustible. The world and its resources are finite. As this understanding dawns on the world, we propose to put governments in a new position, one that requires leadership, not from bankers and lawyers, but from eco scientists and experts in sustainable culture. This is because governments stripped of other sources of revenue would be forced to rely heavily on the sustainable husbandry of all natural resources and Commons within their jurisdiction. Most government revenues would come from resource royalties and user fees. In addition, a general sales tax could be enforced through mainstream retail businesses. And where there are socially and environmentally unwelcome activities, governments could also target them with punitive taxes. The result of this new approach to taxation would be much higher prices on resource intensive items, especially non-renewable ones. But it would also result in the elimination of most existing forms of taxation. The equal of all men to the use of land is as clear as their equal right to breathe the air, it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their ecistence. For we cannot suppose that some men have a right to be in this world, and others no right. ~ Henry George, Progress and Poverty (bk. VII, ch. I) Negatives? So, what are the potential downfalls in the self-issued credit system assuming it was fully established? For one thing, in a free and global trading system backed by private production, any issuer's money would only be as good as the demand for their product. As well, people might try to buy something and discover that the credit they want to spend is not acceptable to the seller. The seller can refuse acceptance for any reason, financial, political or personal. This would certainly be a nuisance to the buyer and could easily cost the seller the sale, even many sales. So, most sellers would not boycott any issuer's credit without a good reason. Because private credit would not be backed up by legal tender laws, the choices would be: 1. the buyer trades for credit acceptable to the seller; or 2. the seller decides to accept the credit the buyer offers. This is what happens now when making a foreign purchase. Another feature of this proposed system is that the amount of credit people have in their possession would be constantly changing by small amounts, as credit valuations change with the market. This would be disconcerting at first, but as all credit issues self-correct automatically, up should balance downs over time. In the current system, if you have accounts in several different national currencies, you know that the total calculated in any one of them changes constantly. The difference is that, with national currencies, variations in the trade value of the national currency affect everyone in the nation. With self-issued credit, the value of the credit at anyone's possession would depend only on the balance of trade of the producer that issued it, not the nation's central bank or politicians. If a government over spends, it would only devalue the government's own credit, not everybody else's. A crisis in customer confidence could destroy an issuer's self-issued currency, but that's also no different than today trying to get credit from the bank. Purposeful attempts to destroy an issuer's credit would backfire on the aggressor because of the self balancing feature. In every scenario we've examined, attempted attacks on an issuer via currency aggression would be just as damaging to the aggressor as to the victim. But destruction from the inside would always be possible. If the issuer's employees feared that their employer's credit might devalue, they might all try to trade away their paycheck credits on mass. This would cause the devaluation they feared and accelerate the sell-off. The public might join in. This would have the potential to trash the issuer's credit entirely and thereby destroy its ability to carry on business. However, there is a plus side to this scenario. All that devalued credit would still be guaranteed by the issuer. That's because, by the rules of this proposed system, issuers would always have to redeem their own credit at par, no matter what the market value. This brings us to another self-correcting feature of the system. Here's how it would work. Those who might be considering buying the issuer's products would have the opportunity to obtain more of the issuer's devalued credits than they would pay in higher valued credits. Because the issuer must redeem its own devalued credit at par, this makes the issuer's products more of a bargain and, thus, more likely to sell. Increased sales would tend to bring the value of the issuer's credit back up. Another self-correcting mechanism would arise from currency speculators. They'd ask themselves: will demand for the issuer's goods or services actually be destroyed? Or production fail to meet the demand that survives? If demand did survive and production meted, buying would replace selling as the maturity dates approached. This would bring the value of the devalued credits gradually back to par. Those who invested in them would enjoy an increase in purchasing power. In our current system, speculation in national currencies is a deliberately destabilizing and parasitic practice that can indiscriminately rob all citizens in the target nation of their savings. In this proposed new system, currency speculation would help stabilize and restore the value of troubled issuer credit. It would allow those with doubts to voluntarily unload unwanted risk onto those willing to take it. It would also provide opportunities for risk takers to enrich themselves by good judgment as to which credits would survive and return to par. By making the choice to buy devalued credits, currency speculators would be rescuing the issuers they believe in, potentially a valuable service to both the issuers and to society. A common question about this proposal concerns technological capability. Can our technology handle all the necessary data and calculations quickly enough to be practical? No one wants to wait even one minute at a grocery store checkout line as the computer looks up the relative value of many individual credit issues before it calculates the payment. The answer to this is that in the year 2000 there were many informed people who publicly doubted that the internet would ever be fast enough to carry video of a quality worth watching. Ten years later, the Internet is absolutely overrun with free streaming video and high-definition available on wireless handheld devices. When it comes to computers and speed, many cautious assumptions have already been proved ridiculously wrong. In fact, accounting technologies that could implement this proposed system have been in operation for decades. In addition, a person-to-person digital coin has now made the leap from the drawing board to real use. Security and speed are priorities for everyone in the digital world. Where there's a will, there's a way. And the ways already exist. If our political will were to fundamentally overhaul the world's money system, it seems realistic to assume that the technical solutions would be forthcoming. How Will this System Define Its Value System We've saved the toughest question for last. How is the value unit defined if value is always subjective and variable? The real answer is one can never know what the full value of any trade might have been for those involved. Every act has many potential values in our lives, financial, personal, karmic, historic or whatever. For purely commercial purposes, the money value of something is simply the number of money units agreed upon when it's sold. If it's resold tomorrow for more or less, its value has changed, even though the thing has not and it could change back just as easily. different customer different value We have widely agreed upon money units now, they're called national currencies. They're no longer promises of anything specific and their relative values are defined by speculators, hope to profit themselves at everyone else's expense. Nonetheless, national currency units are abstract measures of value that have established a common understanding by being the units in which we price real things. They are, in fact, the only functioning units of value we have. It's been several generations since the masses of people habitually measure the prices of their daily needs in gold or silver equivalents. Quite the contrary, we value gold and silver and everything else in national currencies. So, it makes sense to derive any new currency unit from these existing currency units. Now, it's mathematically simple to translate the often wild fluctuations of one currency against another into a smooth curve down the middle. Speculators love the fluctuations because they provide opportunities for quick and unearned profits. On the other hand, productive business does best with a smooth and predictable trajectory. A little bit of simple math can make a smooth curve out of several jagged ones. This smooth curve creates a new harmonized global currency unit in the same way that removing the noise from a scratchy audio signal produces a clear tone. As the debt money system tears itself apart in wild gyrations, this new global money unit could come into existence by arbitrary definition as the stable midpoint at the center. So, to conclude. The proposed unit of value is to be a purely abstract notion of value, which, in truth, would always be unique to each individual, as value always is. Initially, this new unit of value would be defined by a simple formula, giving it a value in relation to today's national currencies. It would not, however, be tied to any of them. Once established, the new unit would cease to define itself by existing currencies. Instead, its value would be defined by the prices issuers charged for their goods and services. Ties to the bank credit for national currency system would be left behind and the new global self-issued credit system set free. As long as we cling to the superstition that we must look to government for money supply, instead of requiring it to look to us, just so long must we remain the subjects of government, and it is vain to follow this or that policy or party or ism in the hope to salvation. We can control government and our own destiny only through our money power and until we exert that power it is useless for us to debate the pros and cons of political programs. ~E.C. Riegel The Surprise Weapon, Private Enterprise Money, 1944 The Two Systems Compared Now we will review what we've presented in parts 1 and 2 of this movie. In doing so, we will be comparing today's system, based on promises of payment in money, with our proposed system based on promises of payment in real production. In the current system, money comes into existence when it's borrowed from a bank. The bank charges interest on top of the principal, but the money to pay this interest is not created. Therefore, as we've demonstrated in part 1, the bank must spend 100% of the money it takes in as interest, and this money must not be lent at the second time. Otherwise, the debt becomes perpetual. Perpetual debt can never be eliminated or even reduced without causing a default. When paid back as a Principal Payment to the bank, the Credit is extinguished PRINCIPAL BUT... the secondary DEBT REMAINS In this system, credit that is the promise of repayment in money is used as money. By using the promises of money as money, the distinction between money and credit has been lost. Yep, even explained many times it still sounds like some upside-down logic from Alice in Wonderland. But it's even worse. Banks can issue new promises to pay money based on having existing promises to pay money, or on bets that someone will or won't pay, or on corporate equities, so that an enormous inverted pyramid of debts and bets can be based on a few debts at the bottom, like the most fabulous house of cards all made out of "unfunded liabilities". This unfunded liability money can fail dramatically whenever a large amount of debt is defaulted on, bringing the whole financial house of cards tumbling down, unless the government steps in and puts the taxpayer in debt. That is, the government creates more unfunded liabilities to the tune of trillions to replace all this so-called money that was never anything but promises to repay something the banks never had in the first place. Nothing substantial is done to reform this perverse system, because those in control make out like bandits raking in huge personal gains. We're still for us all. The crisis is used as an excuse to further consolidate the bandits' control of the money system. The very people whose wild irresponsibility and/or deliberate criminal intent, those same people who caused the problems are given even more power and even more of our money. So, it will all happen again and again. Without an alternative, we'll be helpless. We'll have our happiness shattered, freedoms stolen and our creativity wasted by greedy scoundrels who produce nothing but the illusion that they have the power to create money. But in reality, they don't. Why? For the simple, logical, and it should be obvious reason that if there was nothing of value to buy with their money, their money would have no value. Money Debt has NO inherent value The only ones who have the actual power to create the value of money are those with the power to create real value in the form of real goods and services. The ones who create real value in the current money system are called borrowers and they must repay their borrowing in so-called money. But for the most part, this so-called money isn't money at all, it's bank credit, a form of debt that can only be created by banks, the supply of which is, thus, limited and controlled by banks. In complete contrast, the self-issued credit system creates money as a promise of delivery of the goods and/or services of an issuer, not borrower. As such, it's real money or hard money, a positive quantity, not a negative quantity like the debt of money. It can be created by anyone who can back it up with real goods and services in demand. And it is payable only in goods and services. This ensures that the promise can only be collected on by hiring or purchasing from the issuer who made the promise. Accepting an issuer's credit over time would be materially rewarded as in the current system. But this material reward, whether regarded as interest or dividend, would be payable in products or services only, not in money. Therefore, the arithmetic problem created by conventional money interest, that is to say, being compelled to pay back more money than was created, would no longer form the basis of the money system. Issuers would pay this interest or dividend to their customers by redeeming their own mature credit in product at a higher value than any other. This would create the motivation for the issuer's credit to flow back to the issuer at the maturity date, just when the issuer planned that it would. By means of a free market, purchasers would trade the various issuer credits in their possession for the mature issuer credit of their choice. They would then reap the benefits of a lower price when they purchased the products or services of that issuer. Exchanging for maximum value credit would happen constantly at the wholesale level, where getting the absolute best deal possible would be a competitive imperative. Individuals would almost certainly do the same when making large purchases directly from an issuer, as the savings would be well worth the effort. Unlike the current system, which is technically bankrupt at all times, this proposed system eliminates conventional bankruptcy for the issuers of credit. In this proposed system, poor issuer business simply means below par credit. Profitable issuer business means above par credit. In either case, the required action is to match spending with demand. And if this is not done deliberately, the system's arithmetic does it automatically. There's no escape. However, unlike the rigid payment schedules in the current system, there would never be any pressure to sell a minimum amount of products or services within a certain time to satisfy the fixed conditions of a bank loan. And should an issuer's credit lose some or all of its value, the loss is immediately socialized by a flow amongst those who voluntarily accepted that issuer's credit. How? Simple. Flow works just as well in distributing losses as it does in facilitating trade. Devaluing credit could be a hot potato set up by the software to be spent first in every transaction. Flow could, therefore, spread imperceptibly small losses amongst a very large number of people, harming no one. It would be straightforward. It would not threaten the collapse of any bank and the loss of depositors' savings, nor would it require government intervention with taxpayer-funded bailouts laying astronomical debts upon future generations. Quite the contrary. The unavoidable loss of value would be taken care of immediately by an organic, somewhat random, and entirely voluntary process. Where's the justice in that? There's justice in this arrangement because producers are trying to supply us with what we need and want. Consumers would have nothing to consume without producers and producers would have no one to produce for without consumers. So, in reality, consumers and producers are indispensable partners for each other. So, why should the producers take all the risk and the consumers take none? If we think of farmers, the concept should be clear. If they don't grow food, we don't eat. That's a fact that today's spoiled consumers should reflect on before every meal. So, given our total collective dependence on farmers, why should farmers have to enslave themselves to banks in order to feed us? Where's the justice in that? In a self-issued credit system, farmers could form cooperatives to support each other and issue a common credit currency themselves as claims against their harvest. All those who eat would accept their money and become shareholders in these harvests. Thus, an engaged and mutually supportive social arrangement would be created. Without shoemakers, we'd have no shoes; without automakers, no cars. Regardless of our race, politics or religious beliefs, we're all dependent on the same basic necessities of life. In a self-issued credit system, holding an issuer's credit would be a form of shareholding in the issuer. So, to that extent, everyone would be a shareholder in a variety of enterprises at all times. To hold shares is to share risk. This would sometimes lead to losses of value, since losses can't be avoided in any system. But in this proposed new system, they would be immediate losses. They would not turn into perpetual and unpayable fantasy debts dumped onto future generations. Common Cause If widely adopted, self-issued credit could transform society in many positive ways. Issuers, their employees and the non-issuer economy, in which the employees spend their pay, would all have a common interest in maintaining the value of their local issuer's credit. This would be particularly true because, to stay within their business plans, issuers would have to value their own credit at par when they pay their employees, regardless of the actual market value of their credit. If the issuer was spending more than it was earning, the market value of its credit would sink below par and the issuer's employees would find the real purchasing power of their pay reduced proportionately. This cut in pay would also apply to the issuer's executives and shareholders, as well as everyone else near and far that was holding that issuer's credit. This would result in more public engagement with, scrutiny of and pressure upon corporate decision-makers. BAD MANAGERS Self-Reliance In this proposed new system, the fundamental change in paradigm is that money comes from within, not without. Any community with the resources and resourcefulness to create value could create its own issuer money to represent that value. No disapproval from a bank or government, no shortage of money, no banking crisis, near or far, needs stand in the way. And, as an issuer, if you can maintain your balance of trade, then your credit is at par. The actions of others, even reckless governments, can have no direct effect on the value of your self-issued, self-maintained and self-reliant credit. Voluntary Acceptance A basic rule of this new system is this: unless an issuer's credit has been voluntarily accepted, it is rejected. Very simple. No private credit money can ever be forced upon us. However, if the self issued credit system were fully adopted, governments at all levels would be among the largest issuers of credit. That credit being payable for taxes. Like other issuers, government would honor its own credit at a higher value than any other. So, it would be naturally advantageous to acquire government credit to pay taxes. There would be no need to make it mandatory to acquire government credits. Unlike private issuers, government would still have the exceptional powers of a ruling authority. For instance, government would still be able to compel its customers to pay for its services without them being priced or even accepted in a competitive market. As well, government would very likely continue to have a monopoly on issuing physical cash as part of its credit issue. Legal tender status would have to be retained for this physical cash to ensure that those existing on cash outside the digital world could pay their debts with it. These are the exceptional powers that are reasonable to allow a duly constituted government to have. And it's unrealistic to expect government to ever surrender them. Outside of government, private enterprise issuer credit would be as competitive as the goods and services it represents. Its value would be established by the pricing of real goods and services, as value always ultimately is. And its parity with the universal unit would be indicative of the issuer's success in matching spending to demand. The evidence would be plain for all to see in the issuer's credit record. Voluntary acceptance of issuer credits would also make it possible to boycott an issuer's credit, as well as its products. This would make credit boycotts an additional nonviolent tactic of social struggle. Natural Networks Multiple Unique Interconnected Networks sharting a Common Unit of Value Using a single common money unit does not make such a system a monopoly. Why? Because this is not money as a single uniform commodity, it is money as a measurement unit of value. Instead of a limited supply of dollars from a monopolistic source like banks or government, there would be an indeterminate supply of product credits expressed in dollars. This proposed new system is designed on the absence of any central control, like that of a gold reserve or a central debt dictatorship, such as the International Monetary Fund or the world bank are now calling for. It would, in total contrast, be a spontaneous network of networks, a living multitude of interwoven systems, like nature itself. As all relations would be voluntary, such a system would grow just as the social networking systems like Facebook and Twitter have grown, organically and under no-one's control. All such networks could be as locally limited or globe-spanning, as the participants require. Open to ALL For major industries and governments, credit acceptance could be very general, amounting to a de facto decentralized global currency, arising naturally and spontaneously from real productivity. Compare that with what we have now, an unstable, unredeemable currency created by various acts of outright fraud, imposed by the top-down machinations of an invisible and unaccountable banking elite and their paid-for agents in government. These guys control billions of people through debt, because our minds are mired in the false belief that bankers have money. Is it not time we the people woke up and made better choices?

This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks, which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank... sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to inflence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. Only a revolution in the mind of the individual is needed to accomplish the greatest stroke for freedom of all time. It is a remarkable fact that no constitution of any state, nor any declaration of human rights, has ever proclaimed the right of freedom of money issue. Yet this right is inseparable from the right of bargain or exchange, which is the very foundation of liberty. Man's ignorance of the laws of money has blinded him to the very touchstone of freedom. You are indeed sovereign, if you but realize that your money power is your sovereign power. You need no political laws to liberate your power for prosperity and peace; you are the master of your fate by natural law, if you but discover that law. As you scan the world scene with all its miseries, its drab outlook, the discouraging prospect of a solution for humanity's problems by political means, and the remoteness from you of the capitols through which promised salvation is desperately hoped for, you are saddened be a sense of frustration. But if you realized that the citadel of power is your own home and that yours is the majesty and sovereignty, sadness will be dispelled by gladness. To bring this transformation you must comprehend the power of money and that you are the money power. ~E.C. Riegel, monetary theorist The New Approach to Freedom 1949 Monetary Reform Movements Gold Awareness of the need for real change in the money system is growing. But what direction to take, what exactly is the problem and how can it be solved? The safest and only real choice, many people argue, is to return to gold or a gold standard because this worked for millennia in the past. But gold itself is impractical for transactions in the modern world. It was impractical centuries ago, which is why the promise to pay gold system developed. And so it is certain that, in practice, transactions would be conducted in promises to pay gold, not gold itself. Thus, the promises to pay gold money will only be as reliable as the promises. So, in reality, it isn't the gold that makes the system work, it's the reliability of promises. Would they be reliable promises? Maybe. But what we would be using as money would be like the old goldsmiths promises, made in the knowledge that only rarely does anyone ever ask for real gold. This was the problem with the goldsmiths situation. The real gold was seldom claimed, allowing fraudulent promises of gold to be made and used as money. Why would history not repeat itself if all the same elements remained in place? Another thing. What most people say they like about the gold system is that the promise of gold money is a promise of a specific amount of real value. Now, this is an odd idea, given that the vast majority of us have no use for gold. So, how much real value can it have for us? Wouldn't a promise redeemable in food, clothing or shelter be much more real? People also like the idea that gold is just gold, it doesn't need a government to create it. However, it does need miners. In a gold money system, mining discoveries, jewellery making, industrial use, hoarding and counterfeit bars of gold-plated tungsten, would all influence the money stock. What on Earth does any of that have to do with the need for money for trade? Lastly, gold as money is a single uniform commodity manifesting all the inherent mathematical defects of lending, demonstrated in part one of this movie. Being a coin with intrinsic value doesn't make any difference. A lot of gold and silver's appeal comes from a belief in an oversimplified version of history. People assume that coins were invented to standardize the inherent value of the metal they contain. This is true, but right from the beginning, some of the earliest coins were created based on a diametrically opposed idea. This was done because the rulers at that time foresaw the inevitable negative consequences of using limited supplies of precious metals as money. Therefore, they chose to avoid that route. Instead of precious metals, these rulers struck coins of iron or copper and defined their value by decree. What's more, these coins by decree were heated and dipped in vinegar, so the metal they contained would have no intrinsic value. These coins were in fact the original and true fiat money. They were merely tokens of value, money created by law and enforced by the ruler's authority. And I can force my subjects to accept it Fiat Monopoly Pure fiat money is the other main idea favoured by money reformers. They would restore fiat money to its true status as a national government monopoly on money creation. This current of money reform, in stark contrast to the the gold advocates, insists that true money is fiat money by authority of the State. This money is to be simply spent into existence as a promise by the State to accept the same money back in payment of taxes. The taxes are compulsory and the State also promises to enforce the acceptance of this money in court. These are very reliable promises and can result in very reliable money, if not abused. The problem these fiat money reformers have with the current system is that government has given away this power to private bankers and is now borrowing at interest money it could create itself with a few keystrokes, just like the banks do. This results in a massive unplayable national debt on which interest will forever be paid. This ever growing national debt expands the money supply when new money is created by the Central Bank to buy more government debt. And the interest burden passed on through taxes adds to the cost of almost everything we buy one way or another. In contrast to money being created as national debt, fiat money simply spent into existence would save the taxpayers immense sums of interest. It would free future generations from impossible debt and it would forestall the tendency to inflation because the money supply would not grow forever with the national debt, as there would be no national debt. In the fiat money system, taking fiat money out of circulation by means of taxes preserves or restores the value of the remaining money in circulation. Not taxing it back sufficiently would devalue it. Understanding the proper use of government fiat money is a revelation. If you can charge prices or taxes for something in the future, you can issue that much new money now because it is your valuable services to others and the reliability of your promises that create the real value of any money. The government can honour its promises to accept its money back in taxes and it will make your debtors pay you in government fiat money if you take them to court. These are good reasons why government issued money works now and why it would work if governments just self issue this credit, instead of borrowing it from banks. But in this pure fiat money system, the money supply must still be determined by a central authority. Therefore, the money supply is still limited, monopolistic and managed from above. They have the power to create money and you have to get the money from them. They also have the power to create way too much money and spend it on wars and other unproductive activities without the approval of those whose productivity gives that money its value. In the current system, these inflationary debts are now beyond absurd, threatening to crash the entire system and drag the whole world into chaos. To save themselves, governments are now laying impossible claims upon the productivity of generations yet unborn, a truly hopeless cause given the overall world situation. Witnessing government performance to date, many people believe that returning the full power to create money to corrupt, incompetent politicians, would not only fail to solve our problems, it would be the height of insanity. It would really all depend on the quality of the people in government. Fiat money reformers believe there would have to be a substantial revolution in government to rest this power back from the banks. Therefore, they believe it would be reasonable to expect that honest and competent people with a sincere concern for the public good would be in charge. But, good guys or bad, we would still be dependent on some distant someone else to maintain the value of our money. And they would have a thousand pressures and temptations to enrich themselves by not doing so. And like gold is money, government fiat money is a single uniform commodity manifesting all the inherent mathematical defects of lending at interest and twice lent money. Once the government creates the fiat money and it goes into the banking system to be lent at interest, the problems created in the current system will continue as before. So, this pure fiat money idea might be very useful in rescuing governments from their own hopeless financial positions, and it is a limited example of the self-issued credit principle being advocated here. But pure fiat money would not address the root problems inherent in the math of lending, unless the principal were expanded beyond government. Advocates of pure fiat money like to claim it is money created by law, as if it were independent of economics. But if new fiat money were just spent into existence, year after year, without being removed from circulation as taxes, it would become worthless. What these fiat reformers tend to ignore when quoting history is that, in ancient money created-by-law systems, the prices of critical commodities were also dictated by law. In fact, the value of money was defined by the ruler as so much of a certain commodity. Charge more or less for the designated commodities and it could be off with your head! Today, price controls like this, could only be achieved in a self isolated and totally bureaucratically controlled economy, like Soviet communism. In a free market global economy, money created by law is bound by the same laws of supply and demand as any other single uniform commodity money. In other words, pure fiat money in a free market is an illusion, there's no such thing. Self-Issued Credit In the third stream of money reform are the various types of so-called alternative currencies, all of them based on some concept of money being created as self-issued credit. Many examples of such systems exist today all over the world. Some are very successful business to business barter networks, in which businesses create product credit money to use among themselves, independent of banks and government and usually interest-free. Such systems are tolerated, and in Switzerland, the existence of the WIR system is generally credited with stabilizing the banking system by expanding when the conventional system contracts and vice versa. But in the past, when they became too successful, alternative currencies were usually suppressed by the banking system or even outlawed by government. This is OUR racket So, active suppression is the most significant external problem. The most common inherent problems with these systems are their limited scope and acceptance, their operating costs and the unreliability of member credit. What the conventional banking system provides, worldwide reach, affordability, credit checks and debt enforcement, are the necessary services that are usually inadequate or prohibitively expensive in the alternative systems. whose loss is it? Once the small group of idealistic and honest originators are joined by members exhibiting the full range of human behaviour, alternative systems discover they must deal with cheaters. Some are deliberately cheaters, others just not too conscientious about their debts. And at the opposite end of the spectrum are the hyper conscientious people who won't issue credit because they are afraid they wont be able to fulfil it. The self-issued credit system cannot work if the members are afraid of issuing credit. And that is why it makes far more sense that government and essential industries like farming, forestry, mining, manufacturing and construction should be the main and widely accepted sources of self-issued credit, not vulnerable individuals trading haircuts for pottery. However, we are talking about creating a truly liberated system of exchange. Therefore, in this proposed new system, anyone would have the freedom to issue credit, because only voluntary acceptance would determine the circulation of it. The cost of accounting in self-issued credit systems could be overcome entirely by emerging technologies allowing the creation of a digital coin. Digital coins could be passed from one owner to another, peer-to-peer, so that no bookkeeping and no third party involvement, like banks and pay-pal, is required. This leaves only the problem of achieving global spread. Thanks to technology again, this could now be achieved at little cost and at the same rate and with the same ease that the existing social networks like facebook and twitter have spread. So, there is a positive answer to all the questions we have posed in this movie. And there is a solution that has the potential to unite the three seemingly conflicting schools of money reform into one cohesive movement for fundamental monetary change. Because, when examined closely, be it gold, tax receipts or someone's goods and services, all three schools of money reform are really calling for the same thing: money that is redeemable for something specific from someone specific. Once one comes to that realization, it becomes obvious that self-issued credit, for the full range of goods and services in demand, would necessarily include gold, silver and government tax receipts, as these are also things in demand. We just need to look beyond obsolete beliefs to see the heart of the situation. The all-inclusive self-issued credit system, the basis for almost all so-called "alternative" currencies, could contain within it both the precious metal and the payable-for-tax models of money without any contradiction. Self-Issued Credit Taxes PAID Conclusion Money has both religious and social histories that are fascinating and go well beyond just the need for trade. But for our practical purposes in this presentation, money is the invention that overcame the limitations of direct barter. Money is, therefore, a technology, a way to solve a problem. Most of us would agree that we have a problem with our money system. This is no surprise once we realize the current system was designed by bankers in their own interest and governments wanting to pump out artificial money to wage war and pay for it with a hidden form of taxation called inflation. It was not a well-thought-out project of mathematicians and engineers seeking to create a money system for the general benefit of humankind. There are now many people, including mathematicians, engineers, and even cartoonists, trying to rethink money, as the need to do so becomes obvious. In this presentation, we've proposed that we return as close to direct barter as we can, because doing so would anchor the money system directly to the real world things we want to exchange. The destructive flights of fantasy money, that have brought the current system to its breaking point, would not be possible. Self-issued credit is not a new idea. It is, in fact, an idea as old as numbers and written record keeping, that is very old. However, only with our new technologies can it finally achieve its full potential as an international medium of exchange. And this transformation is already underway. Extensive electronic barter networks, some with their own currencies, exist among businesses right now. These could grow into a new global money system. In Canada, Canadian Tire money has been a self-issued credit for goods currency for decades. This money is redeemable for merchandise at Canadian Tire stores only. But is widely exchanged as payment by third parties, because almost everyone eventually buys something at Canadian Tire. Like air miles and other bonus-point systems, it is only a Customer Reward Program at present, but anything that can serve the purpose of money can be money. Private enterprise self-issued credit money already exists in several forms all over the world and more private enterprises are going in this direction. Money becomes money by acceptance. So, one could say, the path to freedom lies before us if we can only accept new and broader ideas of what money is. Looked at logically, why wouldn't a legally binding contract for delivery of specific goods and services from a specific supplier be much more acceptable as a medium of trade than the much abused government bank Monopoly money we are using now? And does it not seem natural and logical that the source of money should be the same as the source of real wealth, the productive members of society? And does it not seem natural and logical that the value of anyone's credit should be determined solely by their own proven success at living within their means, no one else's? And does it not seem natural and logical that the value of what we have earned with our work and productivity should not be susceptible to being destroyed or stolen by the gambling of some very greedy people? We hope that watching the Money as Debt series has given you insights into why our money system functions the way it does. We also hope that we've demonstrated how a return to gold or a switch to any single uniform commodity as money does not solve the fundamental problems with money. Manipulation of single commodity money has milked productive people of their life energies and prosperity for millennia. That this predatory wealth extraction system could soon take the form of a single global bank emerging as an unaccountable big brother world dictatorship, should concern everyone. We hope you're encouraged to do your own thinking about money, a subject that has been ignored and misunderstood by the public for much too long to our great disadvantage. And, not to criticize without offering an alternative, we have, in this final movie of the series, offered a comprehensive and detailed picture of how a radically new economic system might work, if interest-bearing product vouchers were the medium of exchange, thus eliminating money as a commodity in itself. Instead, money would be a global measurement unit like minutes, meters and tons. The existing physical situation on this planet is not sustainable and the number one technical obstacle to doing anything serious about it is the current growth addicted money system, which is itself unsustainable. The crisis is upon us. If you'd rather think about solutions than despair about the problems, think about taking back our money power with self-issued credit. Join with others who realize the need for radical change and spread this knowledge and understanding as fast and as far as you can. The masses of people must take upon themselves the responsibility to wake up, realize our power and create something better. The WORLD belongs to us ALL To trade goods and services is a natural right of all people. To issue the money necessary to make these exchanges is also the natural right of all people who are intelligent enough to do so. We need not beg for money. We do not need to be money slaves: we can be money masters. ~E.C.
