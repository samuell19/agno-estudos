Love it. Good job, boss. Thank you. Grab a few beauty shots and we'll call it a day. Got it. That looked great, Lily. Oh, Nicole. Thank you. It's not every day I get a compliment from the network in person. Everyone's impressed with how smoothly things have been running on these first couple of episodes. Well, this is the third show in a row I've produced for you so I better know what I'm doing by now. Good point, which leads me to my next question. Do you have any plans for dinner tonight? I don't, but I think I'm about to? Let's aim for 8:00. I'll have my assistant call you. And great job. Did she give you a production deal? Not yet, but um, she's taking me to dinner so we'll see. Wow, good for you. -Here you go. -Thank you. Walk with me? Yeah, ok. Tell me the truth. Yeah? I deserve this, right? I'm not just fooling myself here, am I? Lily, how can you even think that? You are the most talented executive producer in town. Nicole is a fool if she doesn't give you that deal. Oh, I hope so. Well, nobody deserves it more than you do. As long as you don't forget about us little people, of course. You do realize you're taller than me. Oh yeah, I am, aren't I? Well, then I guess it's me that will be forgetting about you. I'm going to get ready for dinner. Are you ok setting up the Pineville office in the morning? Yeah, of course. But don't be too long. You're the one who went to college there, not me. That was a long time ago. I'm sure it's completely changed by now. Well, how long is it gonna take me to get there tomorrow? It's about four hours from LA. I'll see you at lunch time. Ok. Good luck tonight. And Lily, you deserve this. Thank you. [soft jazz music playing] ♪♪ Would you like to be seated at your table now? Um, not just yet. I think I'm gonna wait a little longer. Thank you. Just let me know when you're ready. [phone rings] Nicole? Hi. Do I have the wrong restaurant? Oh, no, no. It's no problem. I totally understand. Let's reschedule when you come up for air. Ok, thank you. We have room here if you'd like to join us. No, thank you. Excuse me? Yes. Could I get the menu please? I think I'm going to order some take-out. ♪ So we'll do that in half an hour, ok? Tandy, where do you wanna set up the edit bay? Uh, probably in the back office? But let's just hold off until Lily gets here. Ok. [phone rings] Please tell me you're on the way. I'm just about to. How's it going up there? How do you think? It's running like a well-oiled machine. [laughs] I know, I shouldn't have asked. Seriously, we should be up and running before lunch. Good. That's good to hear. Hey, how did your meeting with Nicole go? Oh, she never made it. She had a problem on another show and she had to bail at the last minute. Oh, that's a bummer. Yeah, it happens. It just- it would have been nice to get some good news before we started filming the next episode. I mean, we run a really tight production, everyone knows that. Of course they do. They are going to give you that production deal, Lily. It's only a matter of time. In the meantime, we have a show to shoot. Okay, see ya soon. ♪ Extra cinnamon, low on the foam. I'm pretty sure you'll like it but if by some chance you don't you're welcome to come back and we can try again. -Hi there. -Hi. What would you like? How's your espresso? Ah, you tell me. It's amazing. Our sentiments exactly. I'll take eight of those, assorted flavours, please. 'Cause if I show up to the office empty-handed it will not go over well. Ok. Is it still tradition to do the river dunk on the first day of the semester? It is indeed. I guess it's safe to assume you're not a tourist? Pineville alumna. Mmm. What about you? Working on my PhD in English Lit. English Literature. That was my major. Oh. Do you by chance know Professor Michelle Townsend? I hope so. I've been her assistant for two years. No way. You- can you tell her that I said hello? Lily Bellenger. Did you move to New York and have some of your work published? Yeah. How could you possibly- Professor Townsend talks about you occasionally. She even uses one of your short stories as a how-to for freshman students. Wow. That just made my week. Thank you, Josh. Oh, you're welcome. I'll get your coffees. ♪ Ok everybody, listen up. Let's put editing in this office over here so they don't bother us, we don't bother them. Main production you can take over the centre of the floor, and we'll put accounting in that office over there. Tandy, can we ask the hotel manager if he could put a double lock on that door for us? Yeah. Alright, that's it for now, guys. Thank you. What's up? I just got off the phone with casting. Apparently one of our couples got cold feet. They're pulling out of the show. Alright, what about their back-ups? Well, we had two. One couple went away on a last-minute vacation and the second broke up. Alright. Well, we can't make the show without three couples so let's put out a social media blast for a casting call and find some local people. There's gotta be another couple in this area that wants to get married on TV. Ok. Brynn, you do realize we're an antique store which means we primarily sell old stuff? Sure, as long as you realize that we are also a business that needs to make money. Fair enough. Look. What do you think? I sold six of these on the website last week. Oh. I like it. But what do t-shirts from our shop have to do with a lifestyle brand website. It's a stepping stone. First I sell t-shirts, then I sell cosmetics, and then I sell a whole line of accessories. Ah. The website just features style and fashion right now but eventually we're gonna move to wellness, food and travel. At least that's the plan. Yeah, well I wouldn't bet against you, that's for sure. [phone vibrating] Scott? This is incredible. What's incredible? You know that TV show about weddings that's filming over the next two weeks, Wedding Countdown? [gasps] No. Diana just saw on a social media blast that they are looking for a third engaged couple to compete. Diana the dog groomer with the... No, Diana, my old college roommate who lives in Los Angeles. She'd be wearing those t-shirts with all the holes in them? She created the website with me? Ah, yes, yes. That would make more sense. But what does that have to do with us? No. I- Just listen. I know what you're gonna say, but they would give us $15,000 to plan our wedding. Absolutely not. And if we win they would give us $50,000. We've only been engaged for like a couple weeks, and you wanted a long engagement so you'd have more time to plan it. You said so. That's true, but think of everything we could do with that money. You know how I feel about shows like this. They're the downfall to civilization. Scott. I can't. Come on. It would only be two weeks of filming and this could be a huge difference for us. And Diana said it'd be great promotion for our website, and it would definitely bring in more business for the store. I mean, these TV shows pull in like a million viewers a week. Diana said, huh? Mmmhmm. Well, I guess we could use $50,000 for a down payment on a house. Absolutely. And it could also pay for a few extended trips to Los Angeles. You know what? Sure. [squeals] Let's do it. Why not? Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Aaaaah. You will not regret this. I promise. Ok. It's really good, we're almost there, but I would love if we could hold the two shot of the bride and the groom just gazing into each other's eyes for as long as possible. Their entire life just changed. I really want the audience to feel that. Good morning. Uh-oh. I know that look. That's either really good news or really bad news. It's really good news. Oh. Brynn Matthews. And where's the fiancé? Uh, we're getting some photos of him this afternoon. Are they local? Yeah. He runs a beautiful antique store about five blocks from here and she just started her own lifestyle brand website. (Lily) Well, she looks great on camera. I'm assuming that he does too but we're gonna have to see a photo. Otherwise, really good find. Thanks, boss. What else do we know about him? The future bride's an open book. She's all over social media due to said lifestyle brand website but the groom is a bit of a different story. That's rare, and refreshing. Mmmhmm. They don't exactly sound like the perfect match but maybe that'll work out in our favour. We'll find out more when we meet them at their pre-interview today. Alright, sounds good. Good job. Thanks. So I guess you could say Danny and I met totally by accident. [laughs] He was supposed to be meeting someone on a blind date for coffee and so was I, and we both mistook each other for the people we were supposed to meet. By the time our real dates arrived it was too late. We were hooked on each other. [laughs] And the rest, as they say, is history. That's perfect. Why don't you tell me a little bit more about what type of wedding you've got planned? We're going for more of a handmade, eco-friendly wedding. I even made our wedding rings out of repurposed steel and wood. Except for the engagement ring, of course. No, that was my grandmother's. And I made my own wedding gown out of material from a local antique store, and I asked my bridesmaids to just wear a dress they already own. I mean, why not, right? Who says we can't get married and help save the planet? Ok. Alright, well that's enough for now. That's a cut! That was great, you two. Thank you so much. Great. -Lily? -Yeah. The third couple us running a little late but they should be here soon. Alright, I think we're ok on time. Everyone take five until the next couple gets here! [phone rings] Hello? Lily. Nicole. Sorry about cancelling the other night. How are things going up there? Yeah, we're good. We're good. We're up and running and we've got three terrific couples for the next episode. That's great news. I gotta say, you may be the only show currently in production that I don't have to worry about. Oh, that's nice of you to say. Thanks, Nicole. Well, it's the truth. And I'm making sure everyone over here at the network knows it. Wow. Wow. I don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Just promise me you'll continue to keep all of the drama in front of the camera and not behind it. Nicole, my reputation speaks for itself. The shoot will run like clockwork. Trust me. Well, that's great news. Listen, I gotta go. Let's talk soon. Ok. Lily. I'd like you to meet our third bride. This is Brynn Matthews. Hi. -Down boy. -Oh, hi. I'm so sorry. No, don't be. [laughs] Hi. Wow, he's friendly. He never takes to people this easily. Aww. How long have you had him? Actually, Ollie belongs to my fiancé. Wait a minute, did you say "Ollie"? Mmm-Hmm. Sorry, I had to close up the shop, am I late? This is my fiancé, Scott Meyers. Scott, this is um... I'm sorry, I didn't quite get your name. Lily. Lily Bellenger. Lily is the executive producer, so be nice. That's great. Hi Lily. Hey. Can I talk to you for a sec? In private? Uh, sure. What's uh, wrong? Um, just uh, give us a sec. Babe. It looks like somebody's getting cold feet. Mmm? Maybe this wasn't what he thought it would be. No, it's um... it's worse than that. What do you mean? That's my ex-boyfriend. [clears throat] Look, all I'm saying is that maybe the timing isn't right. I mean, we threw this whole thing together in such a rush. Should we just hold off and throw a proper wedding like we always planned? Wait, why the sudden reluctance? You agreed to be part of this with me, didn't you? I did, but- But what? I cannot believe that you and groom number three used to date. I mean, what are the odds? Was it serious? How long were you guys together? Tandy, I promise I'll tell you everything but all you need to know right now is that it was a clean break, not gonna affect the show. Ok, well are you sure? 'Cause that didn't exactly look like the warmest reunion I've ever seen. Ok. Ok. I'll go talk to him, make sure everything's ok. (2nd AD) Tandy, go to two. Go for Tandy. Lily is needed back at base camp. Something to do with night permits. Copy that. They need you back at base. You go, I will talk to those two. Thanks, Tandy. Ok, there's something you probably should know before we- Sorry, guys. Is everything ok? I'm so sorry, we're holding everybody up, aren't we? No, not at all. It's just we're on a super tight schedule and we wanna get started. Of course, I'm ready. It's gonna be fine. Trust me. Hmm? Ok. Great, come on. -Hey. -Hey. I heard the interviews went well. Um, yeah. Yeah, I guess so. (Both) Listen, I had no idea- Ok, you go ahead. You go ahead. I was gonna- [laughing] This is a little too awkward. Yeah, tell me about it. I'm assuming, from Brynn's reaction that um, you haven't told her about us. Not exactly. She knows I had someone in my life but uh, there was never any real need to go into any detail about you until now, of course. Right. Yeah. Totally understand. Yeah. Uh, that being said, I think you're probably gonna have to tell her. Oh yeah, I was about to. But then we got sidetracked with all of this. Right. Yeah. [dog whimpering] [laughing] Aww. I can't believe he still remembers me after all this time. What? Are you kidding me? I once played an old video of one of our old trips and he flipped when he heard your voice. Aww. I mean, I was... cleaning up through the closet. It kinda rolled out... It kinda... I didn't even know if it'd work. I get it. Which trip was it? Yosemite. That was a great week. Right? I can't believe we climbed Half Dome. Yeah. Um, yeah. I better... I gotta get to my desk. Yeah, Brynn's probably just done with make-up, so... Mmmhmm. It was good seeing you again, Lily. Yeah, you too. You too. And I'm glad you- you found someone and... Thanks. Yeah. Smooth, Lily. ♪ So how long do you need me to pretend that nothing went on between you and groom number three? Just a ballpark figure. There's really not much to tell. We met here, in college, we started dating our freshman year and after we graduated we moved to New York so I could become a very successful writer. Oh. Scott got a job as a photographer at an auction house. Oh. Sounds like the perfect little love story so far. So what went wrong? The promise of fame and fortune. A talent agent read a short story that I happened to get published and next thing you know I get a job offer as a staff writer on this new one-hour drama series. Only catch is it's shot in LA. Wow, good for you. He was in the middle of a big project at work so we both decided that it'd be best if he just stayed in New York and came out if things worked out for me. That makes sense. Yeah. Except the show barely lasted one season before it was cancelled. Oh. So what, did you move back to New York after, or...? Uh, no. I got another job. Kept going. So we tried to do the long distance thing but, you know, that didn't work out. Until fate brought you two back together. I don't believe in fate. The past is the past. What does that even mean? Well, it means he's getting married and I'm here to make a show about it. ♪ Hey. So Megan and her sister and mom are outside, they're all ready to go. Make-up just needs about five more minutes. Ok, great. Try to keep everyone quiet out there 'cause we might only get one shot at this. Got it. Look at all these dresses. Maybe I should buy one for my special day. You're not even dating anyone, Tandy, are you? A girl can dream, Lily. Seriously, you've never thought about trying on wedding dresses? Almost, once in New York. Spill. I was walking with... someone in the Upper East Side and we passed this magnificent bridal boutique that had a long display of beautiful wedding dresses behind the glass and the way the light hit the window it- it looked like I was wearing one so we were just being silly going from dress to dress critiquing how I looked in the reflection. Until... [laughs] Until Scott said that we should go inside and pretend that we were engaged so I could actually... anyway, that was a long time ago. Alright, let's clear the set, everyone! Roll cameras! Tandy, can you bring everyone in? Yeah, sure. Ok, they're ready. Quiet, please. Wow! Ok, uh, so the next shot we're getting is of Brynn picking up her wedding favours. That's right, she ordered them online. Yeah. I wonder if Scott was able to get his tuxedo. Well, why don't you ask him yourself? Maybe I should say hello? Do you need a chaperone? Beat it. That's a beautiful subject. Oh, hey there. Oh, did you by any chance talk to Brynn about us? I tried, but she's been so busy with the website and the wedding details I haven't been able to find the right time. I'm sure it's no big deal, I just don't want her to pull out at the last minute because you waited a while to tell her. Trust me, Lily, there is nothing that's gonna stop her from being on your show. Nothing. Ok. I trust you. Well, thank you. Oh, I almost forgot. In an hour we're gonna shoot Brynn at the post office picking up her wedding favours. Could you do me a favour and drive her there? It would be really great to capture both of you on screen as she opens it for the first time. Yeah, sure. No problem. I was just heading to the park to finish this roll of film. Wanna join? Yeah. So I've been wondering what happened with your first job in New York. Oh, you know. Typical stuff. Downsizing. The prospect of me trying to make it as a freelance photographer in that city didn't really appeal to me very much. But you, know what, a funny thing happened. After taking so many photos of antiques for the auction house I actually developed a real passion for history. So I came back here and- hold this for a sec- found a place to rent and my shop was born. Good for you. It is. Although, truth be told, Brynn has recently expressed a desire to move back to your neck of the woods. Diana, her business partner, lives in Los Angeles and keeps telling her that LA's the place to be. Is that what you wanna do? Not really. I like it here. But you know, nothing's in stone yet. Enough about me and my life. What about you? Why'd you stop writing? Don't tell me you gave it up indefinitely. Sort of. As you probably know we sometimes have to add storylines to the shows that I make. There's not a whole lot of reality in reality TV these days, so that helps fill some of the void that was there when I stopped writing fictional stories. Looks like we both got thrown down some unexpected paths, didn't we? Yeah. Yeah, but you know, it's- it's good, I have a job that I like and it pays the bills. It could be worse. Well, last shot here but... you know what? I think I could use your help. No. Scott, come on, don't. I look terrible. Excuse me? Am I not helping you out with a scene for your reality show in like... less than an hour? Uh, not fair. The least you could do is pose for one photo, come on. The lighting is great and you look beautiful. So let me just... wait, one second. Up a touch. Hey, guys! I have been looking for you. Hey. 'Sup? Tandy said she needed Scott and me to take some publicity photos before I go pick up the wedding favours. (Scott) More like "we". Looks like I'm driving you now. Oh. Lily thought it'd be a good idea to help improve the emotion on the camera. Lily, great idea. I'm glad you like it. Well, I should get back to base camp and you guys might wanna head over to the photo shoot soon. Yeah. Oh, thanks. See ya. Hi, honey. What's up, sweetie? (Brynn) Oh, I like this. You like that? (Brynn) You look great. (Scott) Thank you. (Brynn) I love this... [door bells jingling] Hey. Hey. Are those for me? Actually, these are for us. I stopped by the florist on the way back from the bridal shop and I chose these three types of flowers for you to choose for our centrepieces. Ok, so what am I looking at here? Purple irises, yellow ranunculus, and the very exotic Lily of the Incas. Huh. Based on the space and the colour we chose for the reception I like the ranunculus. What do you think? I agree. Yellow it is. Cool. Hey, so remember when I told you about a serious relationship I had before you, right? Yeah. What about her? Well, you're not gonna believe this but she's actually back in town. At least for a little while. Really? Yeah. Have you seen her yet? I have. In fact, we both have. What do you mean? You're not making any sense. [laughs] Well, you're not gonna believe... so actually, um, my ex is the TV show producer. Um, Lily Bellenger. [sighs] So, I mean, yeah. You'll be there on the day to deal with this, so will I. But I just wanna make sure that everyone's aware that we have backup wardrobe options for the family members- Tandy? Would you mind the store while I find some place quiet to work on the budget? Sure. I'll text you if anything comes up. Thank you. ♪ Oh, excuse me, ma'am? You dropped your credit card. Oh! Professor Townsend? Lily! Oh, I can't believe it! It's me. Oh, my dear, I'm in shock. Look at you! At your old table. I remember you just like this. It's been a while, hasn't it? It certainly has. Do you remember that short story that you wrote during your senior year? I still use that as an example for my first year students. I actually heard. One of your students that works at the coffee shop told me. I am very flattered. So what are you up to these days? Writing the great American novel, I hope. Well, life took me in a slightly different direction. Mmm. It happens. As long as you're happy. I am. Thank you. Good. Well, if you'll excuse me I'm actually late for a class but- oh, it's wonderful to see you again, Lily. Let's try to stay in touch this time. I promise. And think about writing again. You owe it to yourself. Well, Brynn definitely gets points for going big. I'll give her that. Go big or go home. You really think Nicole's gonna go for this? It- it may be a production challenge but the results are gonna be spectacular. We've never done anything like this before, not by a long shot. Tell me about it. I did go for a hike this morning. I imagined myself out on Walden Pond. It used to help me clear my head, inspire writing. Weird, I haven't thought about that in a long time. Sounds like you miss it. I don't have time to miss it, with our prep, production, planning, post. There's only 24 hours in a day. Well, somehow you always seem to find 25. Back to work. This location is tough but we won't let this mountain get the best of us. No. This is gonna be great. Ok, so I think we should set up two cameras on the altar so we can capture the ceremony and then um, let's put the generator far enough away to eliminate any noise. Alright? Thank you. So, this is what you do all day, ordering people around. I don't like to think of it as ordering anything, I consider it just making suggestions. Ah. Well, don't look now but it looks like my fiancé is making suggestions to Tandy. (Lily) Oh. [laughs] I can see that. Don't worry, Tandy can handle herself. So, you'll be glad to know I told Brynn about us. Good. Good. Yeah, how did- how did she react? Surprised, to say the least, but she was fine. You know, to her the past is the past. Mmm. I couldn't agree more. It's good that you came clean. We can just move on. Lily! Oh, and I forgot. My mom's in town. Is that you? Patricia! How are you? Better now that I'm seeing you. Scott, you never said you invited Lily to the wedding. Actually, mom, Lily is the producer on the TV show I told you about? You're kidding. What are the odds of that happening? You haven't aged a bit. Oh, you're too kind. Thank you. It's the truth. Oh, get over here. Patricia, you're here! Hello, so good to see you. Hey, um... Can I talk to you? I just wanted to let you know that everything is good between us. Between me and you I'm glad you turned out to be the mystery girl. It shows me that Scott's always had good taste. That's- that's really nice of you to say, Brynn. Thank you. I just had a great idea. Why don't we all go to dinner tomorrow night? Hmm? Yeah! Yeah, that's- why not? [squeals] Yeah! We can go to that new place, Chez Louis. It's very trendy. At least for Pineville. Don't listen to him, Lily. You'll love it. Sweetie, come on. I wanna show you what I was thinking of doing during our vows. [laughs] Ok. Ok. [laughs] Yep, that's going to be my daughter-in-law. I think it's great. It's great. She's got really... positive energy. That's one way of looking at it. [door bells jingling] [dog barks] Hey, Ollie. Hi, boy. Well, well, well... I guess they'll let just about anyone in here now. Jeff, hi. When did you get here? I flew in last night. What, you thought I wouldn't come to my best friend's reality show wedding? Do you really want me to answer that? [laughing] Well that didn't take long, did it? Seriously, it's good to see you, Lil. Was Scott expecting you? Uh, no. I just came by to see the place in person before we started shooting here. Do you know where they are? I don't know where Brynn is but Scott's out running some errands and getting us some food. Oh. He left me in charge. Yeah, I told him it was a bad idea but the man's buying me lunch so I do what I'm told. [laughs] Whatchu been up to lately? I am actually a therapist now. Oh, wow. That's one way to get people to listen to you. [laughs] Nice one. What about you? I hear you're a big-time movie producer now. Eh, yeah, I don't know about all that. I um, I've been working in reality TV for several years now. Well, as long as you're happy that's all that matters, right? Happy? I guess. Uh-oh. Did I say something wrong? It's just something I've been giving some thought to since I got back in town. Well, are you happy? Well, reality TV isn't what I dreamed of doing when I got to Los Angeles but I enjoy it. Good. That's good to hear. So, switching gears, how was it seeing Scott after all this time? [laughs] Ok, do you take Visa or MasterCard, doctor? Well, I certainly accept both. But no, come on, I'm just asking as a friend, not a therapist. Um, there's not a lot to say. Of course a lot of incredible memories came flooding back when I saw him again, that's to be expected. But I guess I'm just happy that he's happy. He deserves it. Yeah, yeah, he does. I mean, you both do. Well, I'm sorry to break up the therapy session but I should get back to the office. Alright, well I'll let him know you stopped by. You know, just take it. Yeah, it's on the house. Ok. It was a bad idea leaving you here by yourself. [laughs] I'll pay him for it. -Alright. -Thanks, Jeff. See ya. ♪ Can we make sure that B camera gets a shot of the flower girl? Thanks. Lily, I don't think this tie is working. Should we speak with wardrobe? Yeah, we could. But between you and I it's the first thing I noticed about you this morning. Really? Oh. Well, in that case, never mind. Hi. Whatcha working on? Oh, it's just an idea for a story that I wanna write. Nice. How's it going? I literally haven't even started. It's- it's been a while since I used that part of my brain. I'm gonna go get a snack. Do you want anything? Oh, that's ok. I'm going out to dinner with Brynn and Scott and his mom, Patricia, remember? You're still doing that? Why wouldn't I? It's gonna be great. All of us together. I can get to know Brynn, catch up with Patricia. It'll be fun. Or it could just be really awkward. Please, stop. It's not gonna be awkward. Don't be a pessimist. Ok, fine. Maybe a little awkward. ♪ You know my mom and Brynn should be here like any minute now so... just... gonna- [phone vibrates] Oh. It's Brynn. Her website crashed and she's totally freaking out. She's stuck on the phone with the computer tech. And my mom has jet lag. So it looks like neither of them are gonna make it out tonight. So I guess it's just us. I mean, we can totally call it a night. No pressure. I mean, we could- It's not a big deal. We're just... just having dinner. Yeah. Cool. Should we order? Yeah. Goose liver ravioli? That sounds interesting. Head cheese terrine. Hmm. Not your average Pineville fare. Beef cheek stroganoff. Ok. [French accent] Yes, madam, for today we have our juicy rat cheek extraordinaire... When you put your fork, in it, it will... Sorry. Shh. [laughing] Is Uncle Links's Pizza still around the corner? Come on, now. You read my mind. Let's do it. -Mmm. -Mmm. It's so good. Even better than I remember. You know what? It almost tastes as good as the pizza in New York. Mmm. Hey, I said "almost", ok? [laughs] So I gotta say, I'm really impressed the way you and Brynn are just kinda throwing this whole wedding together. What're you talking about? Isn't that the basis of your whole show? Yes, but never with anyone that I know or dated for so long. Fair enough. You guys, you met here in Pineville, right? Yep. She grew up here. After the antique store was up and running I realized I needed help with marketing so some other business owners recommended her and the rest is history. That's so sweet. They look so much younger than we did at that age, don't they? Speak for yourself. I haven't aged a bit. [laughs] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm a big TV star now, you better be careful. Not yet. I can always edit you out. Good point. [laughs] I uh, really messed that up, didn't I? I didn't handle it so well. Handle what? The break up. I... kinda took the easy way out. Oh, come on. Would you stop? That was years ago. You don't owe me any explanations. I know. I know. I just have been thinking about a lot since I saw you again. Please tell me you're not about to get all serious on me. [laughing] I'm not, I promise. I just- I want you to know that when I got to Los Angeles all I could focus on was my career. I'm sorry. I get it. When that scripted series ended I took the reality TV job 'cause I just didn't wanna look like a failure and go back home with my tail between my legs. Yeah. Well, you should be sorry 'cause you did mess up. I mean, look at me. I'm one of the hottest guys in Pineville. [laughs] Would you stop? [laughs] I was trying to be serious. Ok, ok. I know, I'm... I was just kidding. You know, when it gets too serious I crack a joke. How could I forget? Well, I'm not gonna lie. It wasn't easy losing you back then. And yeah, it took me a while to get over you and finally find somebody else. What're you gonna do? Our timing just wasn't right. Yeah. [message alert] That's um, that's Tandy just letting me know my call time. Yeah, we should probably call it a night. Yeah. You want me to walk you to your hotel? No, that's ok. It's just a block and a half. Thank you. And thanks for a wonderful evening. Well, you're welcome. Goodnight. Goodnight. ♪ Just the two of you? Interesting. What? Would you stop it? Nothing happened. Yeah, thankfully. I knew I shouldn't have told you. Come on, Lily. By the way you described the evening it sounds like there was something in the air. Tandy, it was completely innocent, trust me. Innocent or not, it sounds like a date in my book. Remind me never to read your book. Can't you at least admit there's a possibility there's still a spark? Scott is getting married, as he absolutely should. And I would never do anything to jeopardize that, ok? Not to mention I would never do anything to jeopardize the show because if I did I could kiss my career goodbye. Well, that is true. And seeing as my career is linked to yours, maybe we should just stay away from Scott from now on. Ok? What do you think? I think you probably should have cancelled the dinner the moment Brynn and your mom did. I was talking about the tux, Mr. Fancy Pants. Besides, Brynn said she was cool with it. Oh, Scott. You're such an innocent. She was probably just testing you to see what you'd do. [chuckles] You have been single for way too long, my friend. Well, that's neither here nor there. Look, there's a 50 percent chance that I'm wrong. But if my math is correct that means there's also a 50 percent chance that I'm right. Just sayin'. What- Jeff, it was a slice of pizza with an old friend. Yes, despite our history I still consider her to be an old friend just like I do you. Touché. Look, for the record I know you've always been a stand-up guy, and I know you've always got the best of intentions. I'm just trying to give you a heads up. The situation you're in could get real sticky in a hurry. Yeah. Well, I appreciate it. But I hope you have faith in me to know that I'm- I'm the kind of guy who always ends up doing the right thing. Of course. Without question. And whatever happens, I'll stand by you. You know that. Yeah. But don't forget, I was around when Lily broke up with you so you'll forgive me if I never wanna see you go through that again. You know, 50 percent of the time I have no idea what you're talking about, but the other 50? You actually start making sense, my good man. You sound like one of my clients. Wow. This should be illegal. The name is Beckman. Jeff Beckman. [laughs] Right? Someone had to do it. (Both) I guess it's gonna be me every time. -Basically. -Every time. Is this the right tux? This is our Italian cream cake. Almond coconut with a lovely mascarpone frosting. It's one of our best sellers. Interesting. Ok. What do you think, Patricia? Delicious. I like this a lot. This is our ginger spice cake. Also one of our most requested. Mmm. I think I like this one better. The flavours are more intense. Mmmhmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. I want it to be absolutely perfect. What else do you have? I think I have just the thing. [door bells jingle] Hey. Sorry I'm late, I got held up trying on my tux. How's the tasting going? It's uh, going. That good, huh? Let's just say it has been a work in progress. Hmm. Here we are. This is our newest cake. Pink champagne with raspberry mousse. Mmm. Mmm. This is delicious. I love it. I agree. This is a sure winner. Here, Scott. Taste some of this. Alright. Mmm. Ok. I like this one. Yeah. I'm gonna post these online, see what my followers think. Did I miss something? She's talking about the subscribers that follow her on the website she has, mom. You have like, what, 25,000 followers now, Brynn? Actually, it just reached 30,000 this week. Oh. When we get to over 100,000 or more then they start paying us to post for various brands and products. This has all gone way over my head. But what do I know? I can't even program my cable TV. In any case, I still think that last cake was fantastic, for whatever this old lady's opinion is still worth. Which way is your restroom? In the back to the right. Excuse me. Hey, can we talk for a sec? Sure. What's going on? You seem distracted. I'm just a little stressed, that's all. I mean, I need a cake that's gonna have a wow factor for when I post it to the website. Even if it doesn't taste good? Scott, there are gonna be a million or so people that watch our episode of the Wedding Countdown and that's when a lot of them are gonna decide whether or not they follow me online and subscribe to the website. But part of that decision is based on if they identify with me and like the choices I make during the show. Since they can't taste the cake their decision is based solely on what the cake looks like. Yeah. I get it. But I decided to be a part of this with the understanding that the show would be a part of our wedding, not the other way around. It's not my goal to be a reality TV star. My goal is to start a life with you. And I respect that. But I need you to support me on this the same way that I've supported you with your antique store. It's important to me. Ok. Yeah. I will. Ok.

Well, we've all just watched a cut of the first episode and I've got some great news. We've decided to pick up the back six episodes for a full season commitment. Congratulations. A full season, that's fantastic news. Thank you so much. No, thank you. We're also going to make a big announcement in the press so do me a favour and keep it under wraps until then. Yes, yes. Of course. The network's going to be shifting a lot of advertising dollars your way so we need to make sure that everything goes smoothly from here on out. Doesn't it always? With your productions, absolutely. But we've got a lot riding on the Wedding Countdown now that The Kings of Dallas is off the air. Unlike Kings I want to make sure that all of the drama on your set stays in front of the camera- (Both) And not behind it. Right. I've said that before, haven't I? You are fond of that request, yes. Listen, I gotta run but it looks like I may be coming up with a press crew in the next few days so hopefully we can finally get that dinner I owe you. Sounds good. And thanks again, Nicole. You bet. Was that Nicole? Yes. And? We just got an order for the second half of the season. [squealing] That's so great! I know. She also asked that we don't have any issues on set. None at all. Strange, right? No big deal. That shouldn't be a problem. Yeah. What could possibly go wrong? [sighs] ♪ It was part of the arts and crafts movement of the early 1900's.

Sorry I was late, I grabbed a coffee. Oh, it's no problem. Just, you know, thanks for coming by to help me out. Where is Brynn? She's back at her place on a video call with her maid of honour, Diana. Something about the colour of her wedding dress. She certainly has her hands full. She certainly does. Hold on a second. Is everything ok? Yeah, no. I just got a lot on my mind with it being the week of the wedding. Is that all? Yes. It's just a little stress. It could happen to anybody in our situation. I was just wondering if it's because you're rushing into this. I mean, there's a reason engagements usually last around a year. Ok. Ok, mom. Look, I know you and Brynn haven't had a chance to bond and I apologize. But I think if you just- Son, I'm not talking about Brynn. 'Cause if you love her that's good enough for me. I'm talking about turning your wedding into fodder for some TV show. Your father and I were married for 30 years before he died and you know we certainly had our ups and downs. But I'll never forget our wedding day. It was full of laughter and joy and the love of family and friends who all helped to make it so wonderful. I just want the same thing for you, that's all. Thank you. Yeah. I really appreciate the advice. I really do. But I did make a commitment to Brynn to be a part of the wedding show and I'm gonna keep it. Just like dad would. Thank you. Alright, hey, woah. Come here, little man. Alright, I shan't be long. Okay. Come on. [Ollie barking] Hey, wait a minute, boy. Where are you going? Woah, easy. Looking for someone? Apparently Ollie was. Sorry if we're bothering you. We could totally leave if you're- No. No, it's fine. Come sit down. Take a load off. Alright. Thanks. Hey, wait a second. That looks awfully familiar. I owe you for this. Jeff wouldn't let me pay. You know, I knew it was a bad idea to let him watch the store. No, I'm just playin'. Think of it as a gift. Just happy to see you writing again. Thank you. Me too. This was your spot. For four years. I loved it. I still do. What brought you back? Playing hooky? Um, more of an escape. I thought I would take some time for myself for a change. With your new journal, I see. Yeah. I'm not sure what did it but something this week seems to have cured a really long case of writer's block. That's great. Yeah. That's good, Lily. Yeah.

It's uh... been a little bit chaotic but I think it is going to be a great wedding. Well, don't be upset but I have some bad news. Oh no. What? I broke my ankle at an indoor climbing gym. What? How bad? Bad enough where I have to have surgery on it in less than a week. Oh, I hope your surgery goes well. Me too. But the Wedding Countdown producers are gonna love hearing this news. It'll make for a great twist. Yeah, I hope so. Well, feel better. I'll call you next week. Thank you. What's the latest? Well, I just finalized the menu for the reception with the caterer. I think you're gonna love it. Wait, wait. I thought we were gonna work on it together. It's ok, I took care of everything. I took a poll on the website. They voted for the chicken almandine and the salmon with the capers. You outsourced our wedding menu? Scott, relax. It's not a big deal. Well, maybe it's a big deal to me. I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'd like to have a say. I'm sorry you feel left out, but you have to understand that I am under a lot of pressure here. I respect that, but I wanna do this with you and not just learn about it when it airs on TV. Fair point. -Ok. -Ok. In uh, keeping with that agreement I guess this is a good time for me to show you this. I'm confused. What am I looking at here? Real estate listings in Silver Lake and Venice Beach. As in Los Angeles? Yeah. You know, with all the exposure from the show Diana thought it'd be a really good time for me to- for us to uh, to check out LA for a while. [chuckles] You know, I don't know how you want me to respond to this. Well, Scott, it's not the first time we've talked about it. Yeah, but this is the first time we're having a serious discussion about it. I mean, showing me a real estate listing days before our wedding, Brynn? I know, I know. It's a lot to throw at you. Just promise me you'll keep an open mind about it. Yeah. Yeah. Just as long as you remember this is just a discussion. We're just discussing it. Ok. Just discussing. Can we just discuss these other listings that I found? Excuse me, ma'am. This table is reserved for locals only. Since when? Since 6:00 am this morning. But I promise not to tell management if you let me share it with you. Mmm... deal. [chuckles] So how are you this morning? I'm good, just working on the budget for the next episode. Burning the candle at both ends, huh? No, I just, you know, I like to be prepared. Yeah, I remember that about you. What about you? What brings you out this early? Believe it or not I haven't finished my vows. Ah... The procrastinator. I remember that. Well, we can work in silence if you want. Get that done. Actually, I wouldn't mind some feedback. If that's ok. Sure. Yeah. Great. Uh, read me what you got. Ok, now this is a work in progress, remember. So please be kind. Go for it. All good. [clears throat] Dear Brynn, from this day forward I promise you will always have a shoulder to cry on, a date for the movies, a caretaker when you're sick, a person to laugh with you when you're happy and someone to always kiss you in the rain. I vow to be all those things for you and more for the rest of our lives. Alright, go on. Tell me. You hated it. No. No, I think it's sweet. Yeah, if there was one bit of advice I would give I would say make it more romantic. A little bit more passionate. Not exactly my strong suit, as you know. I know, but try to remember, this is a day that she's dreamed about since she was a little girl so it needs to feel intimate. I hear you. And I would put, um, something powerful right at the end. Something like um, "every moment that I look at you "I hope that my heart always feels like it does "in this moment as I love you more than life itself". Or whatever. That's good. Yeah, I- that's good. I like that. Great. Mmm-mmm. No, you can't use that line, though. You gotta come up with your own version. Right. Uh-huh. Thanks for your help, Lily. I really appreciate it. Any time. [door bells jingle] Holy moly. Look at you! I leave you alone for like a couple hours and you end up filling up the place? I'd love to tell you I had anything to do with this but almost everyone here has been asking if this is where the wedding show is shooting. Seems like word's getting out, but I don't know if people are here to buy antiques or show up on camera. Well, I'm kinda surprised you're even open today with just 24 hours to go before the wedding. Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, the TV show wedding staff did most of the work prepping for the wedding and uh, Brynn took care of the rest so there wasn't a lot left for me to do but show up. Oh, and thanks for letting me work on my vows, mom. And with that, my work is done here, and I'm off to pick up my dress. Well, travel safe. I love you, dear. I love you, too, mama. How's it looking for you, boss? It's good. I want at least one camera to stay on Brynn the entire time. Alright, that's a wrap on rehearsal! See you at the wedding! That was terrific. That was great. I'm so excited for the wedding. I promise to send you out with style. Thanks, Lily. You know, I have to admit, you actually look like you know what you're doing here. I'm impressed. Thanks, Jeff. I think there was a compliment in there somewhere. You're welcome. How was the run-through for you? Yeah, it felt pretty good. Everything ok? Mmmhmm. Yeah, just uh, so much going on, so... You know what, before everyone scatters, Scott, would you guys mind heading over to wardrobe? I think they made some adjustments to your tuxedo. Just wanna make sure they fit. Yeah, sounds great. See you later? Yeah. Maybe I'm reading into this too much but is something bothering you? Me? No. No, I'm fine, really. Alright. You can talk to me if you need to. It's my job. Thank you.

You have a career in Los Angeles that you love. I don't know about love. It's ok. I guess the question for me now is what to do next. What do you mean? Well, I think I'm on the verge of a major deal with the network that airs this show, which would inevitably tie me up for the next two to three years making reality TV. Am I missing something here? I'm waiting for the bad news. Ever since I got back into town after being away for so long this old passion that I had for writing has just come flooding back. Well, that's good, isn't it? I don't know. We'll see. Enough about me. How about you? Do you- do you wanna talk about anything? I think Scott and I are just starting to realize that the differences we used to find so charming are starting to cause problems the closer we get to the wedding. Oh, well that stuff always works itself out over time. It didn't with you and Scott. You got me there. I guess all I can say is that Scott is a good, honest, loyal guy who's gonna be a stable and calming partner for you. But I'm the complete opposite. I love change. Anything exciting and different. That's the problem. That stuff, it just takes time. You guys will figure it out. You think so? Yes. I really do. It's been a long day. We should get out of these dresses and let everyone close up shop. Yeah. ♪ [knocking] Come in. I'm heading home. Are you staying late tonight? Yeah, I need about another hour to finish going through this footage. What is this? Just some behind the scenes stuff. Well, if you wanna sleep in an extra half hour I can get things started in the morning. Oh, that reminds me. I confirmed with transport that they are picking up Nicole tomorrow at 9:00 am. Alright, thanks for handling that. Ok, well, remember to dress for success. I'll wear whatever's clean. [laughs] Diana, hey. How's the ankle? I'm fine. Surgery is in two days. I didn't wake you, did I? No. No, not at all. I still have to go over the seating plan for the reception. Nice. But save your energy. For what? My wedding gift to you. I just had a late dinner with the people who run Trend Benders. Wait, I've heard of them. They're a huge marketing agency, right? Yep. They have taken quite an interest in our website and they want to discuss how we can become part of their group. What? That's amazing. Brynn, I completely understand your situation but this website is gaining traction and I just can't keep doing these meetings by myself. I know. I just have to wait for the right time to discuss things with Scott. His antique store means the world to him, and he's really skeptical about the move to Los Angeles. It's not gonna be an easy conversation. Right now we're just trying to get through the last day before the wedding. Ok. Get some sleep. Thanks. Goodnight. It's been a race against the clock, but everything seems to be on time for Brynn and Scott's last minute dream wedding. Can these two top our previous two fantastic weddings and take home our grand prize of $50,000? It's anyone's guess. And cut! This rain is ruining my hair. Was that one ok for you? You know Lily normally makes that call but I have no idea where she is. [thunder] You know what? Let's do one more for safety, maybe put more of a smile in it this time. What? Nothing. That's exactly what Lily would have said. Tandy, the wedding couple wants to move to plan B. Ok. Guys, we're moving to plan B. Wedding couple's decided to move the ceremony inside. I'm have to say I think that's a good idea. Lily! You finally decided to take my suggestion of sleeping in, huh? Everything in place? Let's shoot this thing and get outta here, huh? Uh, yeah. About that. There's been a small change of plans. Brynn, from this day forward I promise I'll... I'll be... If I... I thought the groom wasn't supposed to see the bride before the wedding. Just checking in on you. No, I'm- I'm good, you know. Just waiting to be told where to go. Right. Everything alright? Have you um... given any more thought to the possibility of us moving to Los Angeles? I have. And? And I'm not sure yet. You know about my time in New York and why I had to come back to Pineville. I do. But New York and Los Angeles are like night and day. And look, we'd still be in sunny California, right? It's only a couple hours' drive away Yeah. Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Brynn, and I wanna support you, I do, but... but I just don't see myself moving from here again. I mean, this is my home, where my business is, and where I hope we start a life together. But I'm beginning to realize you have to be true to yourself, too. We both do. Even if that means... You're right. We can't force each other to be people we're not. You shouldn't sacrifice what you want and neither should I. It wouldn't be fair to either of us. In a way it's probably good this TV show came about. I mean, it helped us realize how different we are from one another. Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. So I guess this is it then. [sighs] But I want you to know, though, I will always care for you and be rooting for you wherever you are. I know. You are a good man, Scott Meyers. One of the best. You go get 'em in LA. I will. [chuckles] Hey, uh, everything ok? Everyone's looking for you two and uh, I've never looked this good in my entire life, so come on, it's go time. Yeah. It is. What just happened? The inevitable. [laughing] [crowd murmurs] Does anybody have eyes on the bride and groom? I don't know. Lily. Hi. How are you? Welcome to town. Thanks. I thought I'd surprise you with a crew from the local news station. That's great. Hi. So we've checked every trailer in base camp and the PA's are looking all over Main Street but no sign of them yet. Ok. Ok. Thank you. Thanks. You can- you can go. Did I get here at a bad time? No. No, not at all. We're just working out a few kinks. You know how it is. So, before the wedding starts I wanted to pass on some other good news. The network has decided to give you an exclusive two year overall production deal. That's amazing! Amazing. Is that all you're gonna say? My friends, I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news. Due to some unforeseen circumstances the wedding has been called off. [crowd murmurs] [knocking] Tandy, hi. Lily, where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Oh, I've been right here not answering the phone. Have you been up all night? Yeah. Yeah. I've been working on this- this letter. To who? Nicole and to the network. It's my official letter of resignation. What? You're leaving? Lily! I... I talked to Nicole about it last night. I just- I told her I... I just don't have it in me anymore. She didn't disagree after what happened last night on set. You think she would have loved all that drama in front of the camera. It was my decision to leave the show. Lily, are you sure this is what you want? You've worked so hard to get to this point. Yeah, but it was only after getting to this point that I realized how far off course I really am. I had my dream job. I hit one little bump in the road and I went and found the closest safety net that I could. Don't- don't get me wrong. I have been proud of every show I've produced. But it's time to get back on track. No more distractions. Well, you do seem to have that spark back in your eyes. Yeah, I- I haven't felt like this in a long time, so I think I made the right call. Right now I just wanna clear my head and not worry about anything so that I can focus on my writing. Do you have enough put away to hold you over? Yeah. I'll be fine. That's good to hear. Mmmhmm. Have you heard from Scott yet? Not yet. Are you ok? I'll be fine. Don't worry about me, you've got bigger fish to fry now. What're you talking about? If you don't have a job neither do I. Which is fine. Maybe I'll take that trip to Machu Picchu. I've always wanted to go there. I don't know why. Tandy, you're not going anywhere. What do you mean? You just said you were quitting. Well, I hate to steal Nicole's thunder but congratulations, Miss Executive Producer. Wedding Countdown is yours now. Yeah right. I talked to Nicole about it last night and she couldn't agree more. You have earned this. It's your time now. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Just make me proud. [laughs] Can I make one suggestion? Sure. You're in charge now. When you're ready, talk to Scott. It might take some time, but aye, aye, sir. [laughing] [Ollie barking] [door bells jingling] Hi, Ollie. Hey, boy. How're you doing? Hey. Long time no see. Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. I was hoping we could talk. Yeah, me too. I know you had quite the mess to clean up at work. Yeah, well it turns out you don't have to stay and clean up the mess if you don't work on the show anymore. I was just in LA tying up loose ends. Oh. Wow. I'm sorry. It's fine. I'm the one who left. It was my call. Yeah, still though, it's... it's gotta be tough. Not as tough as what you went through. I'm really sorry about you and Brynn. Yeah, well, you know, it was definitely the best thing for both of us. It's good that you found out before the wedding. Like, actually minutes before, but still. Hey, you hungry? Wanna grab a bite? Yeah. Sure. Ellen's ok? Always is. We spent so much time at this table. Oooh, did we? I still remember our first date. I couldn't get a word in edgewise. [laughs] That's right. Yeah. I'm surprised you didn't run for the hills right then and there. Oh, no. I loved it. I was so nervous. I was just glad you did all the talking. It was a wonderful night. Yeah, it was.
