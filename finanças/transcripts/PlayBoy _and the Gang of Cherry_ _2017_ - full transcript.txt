I am the one who should ask you. Not the other way around. What do you want from me? What would I get from someone like you? Why are you trying to make her misunderstand me? You got a brain. Figure it out. About what you asked me last night... Were you being serious or just kidding? Bitch! How is it? Who are you talking about? Not you. I had to do it. You had to do it, or you wanted to do it? Of course I had to. Unless you want this ending with you. Do you know what I'm thinking right now? Do you want to have more? Wait here. I'll be right back. How many cuts? A lot. Smartass! What should I answer then? Go and get it done. What the fuck are you looking at? Go! That's enough. Enough! What's the matter? You see... we are having problems. Let's do it a next time. What the fuck is wrong? Jealous? Do I have the right to be? Nobody has the right to feel anything for anybody. We are just taking our responsibilities. That's it. Whore! You can go now. I might have clients in the afternoon. Where are you going? Get some food! Shit. Ouch! What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck do you want? Why don't you sit with me? I'm sitting with you now. Bored? Of you? Of yourself. You know something? If not for Big Boss, I'll still be washing the dishes over there. Where? I asked him of I could have a child seat drink. He would not let me. You wanna be a whore? Do you think I am pretty? I think you have made the right choice. It's me who still has not gone anywhere. Try ignoring your personal feelings. I am bewildered. Don't let it take you over. How was last night? Mac did not use it. But he saw me doing it. Fucking crazy. So what? He helps us making money. And another thing is that we work as a team. What do you want to tell me eventually? Don't imagine what has not really happened. And don't put your thoughts into someone else's. You still love him, don't you? Are you asking me? Or just questioning it yourself? I don't know what you said. But what I know is... You always try to pick on him. What for? This kind of job has taught me to fool others. But you've gone further than I have. Because you fooled yourself. Don't try to drag me into your world. If you don't have me, Your life would be more difficult. I feel like trying. You have the guts? Wana see me try? Sit down. I said, sit down! Sit down!!! Sit! Prick!!! I let use you this gun only when necessary. You must only use it when you have to. Otherwise... Never bring it out. And never point it again at my face! Ever thought... about how... you would live without me? And have you ever thought how you would live without me? Better get going. You have lots to do. What the fuck are you looking at? Move! I said, move! Fucking hell! What the fuck are you looking at me? You're bitch. Did I kill your dad? You're bitch. Did I kill your dad? Cocksucker! You're bitch. Did I kill your dad? You're bitch. Did I kill your dad? Cocksucker! You're bitch. Did I kill your dad? Holy shit! You are here by yourself? Yes How long have you been here? A while. How about you? Just got here. Where are you from? Far. In the city. Have you eaten anything? You're gonna treat me? I can. Anything to eat around here? Yes. Candy. Toys. Everything. Wanna try? Interesting. What are you looking for? Someone. Who? Do you know Mac? Of course. Why did you ask? Wanna see him? No. I'm here to see the other guy. Mac is around here, right? This place is kinda strange. Dark alleys. But when you come upstairs, there is an outdoor space. Bright. Ever get scared? Who exactly are you here to see? You have not told me if you are scared or not. You want me to be scared of what? What are you usally scared of? You are Playboy, right? Why do you know my name? You are famous, aren't you? Not many people know me. Why not? I am not that important. Why would they want to know me? Or perhaps you don't allow them to get knowing you. I want to know only what I want to know. For those I don't want to know, I only see them as strangers. Why do you like having sex with strangers? Maybe because I don't want to know them. You are handsome. Is your boyfriend not jealous? Would anyone with a boyfriend stay in this kind of place? How about you? Where is your boyfriend? Why would you want to know? Good point. Why would I want to know? It's amazing that There are people who would come all the way here. There is just one type of people who would come here. Who? Strangers. Actually... No one wants to come around here. How come? Dirty, I guess. Only dust. For ages there is no rain. Hot. And you like it? Yeah. Kind of. I like the light of the sun. Open space. I like it when people see me the way I see them. How about you? Ever had the same feelings? Yeah. But I feel everything in the opposite way. You already know what you have to do? Where are the toys? Keep this way. When you see the constructed zone, turn left. And you will find. Your toy is waiting for you on top of the building. Should I go with you? Special services? No, it's not. Just my responsibility. Sounds like I am being enforced. So... I will see you in two hours. Make it extreme! Just don't loose your way. So... What are you gonna do with that boy? What are you doing? You are making me worried. This place is dark. And dirty. Not suitable for someone like you. Let's find something to do outside. But it is more interesting in here. But I don't want to do it here. Why not? Afraid? I am the one who should ask you. I had to do it. You have to help me. Okay? I am asking you: 'Are you okay?' Do I have to kill them? Why do you have to waste your time? Let them kill each other. Are you sure about this? Some cases are not in our role. We only have a duty to keep eyes on them. Perhaps the gang of Cherry is not suitable anymore for here. Don't you agree? It's a very sunny day. Do you like it? She walks through this way alone It is reflectively desolated Follow her, keep follow her. What a beating heart! She is wearing slutty appearance That's making me horny. Follow her without loosing sight Want to fuck her Restrain myself. Restrain myself. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. Restrain myself. Restrain myself. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. This shall be raping You shall be raped Seeing you makes me want to rape You deserve to be raped This shall be raping You shall be raped Seeing you makes me want to rape You deserve to be raped Fucked up! The body is gone. Anyone else went into the building, besides that motherfucker? No. You go and take care of the other body. So we don't waste our time. Take this. In case you need it. For what? So you can trust me. What about you? I'll take care of the other body. No. You got to go back to the building. What the fuck are you waiting for? Shoot! Shoot! You take one, I take one. Let it out, so we can go away together. Because you are like this, you have to live in pain. Shoot! Who is going away with you? Did I say that? When did I say that? You don't have the guts to shoot me. How do you know? Because it is too hard for you. You and I don't own each other any longer. And the two of you can sort it out by yourselves. Let's go that way. Wait for me here. Understood? Stay here. You wanna stay with me? Stick out your tongue. Behave! Lie down. Sit. Sit down!!! You wanna stay with me, right? Help me. Help me. I am sorry. Prequel to this weird movie is: BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE
