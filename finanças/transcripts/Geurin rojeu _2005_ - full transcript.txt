Don't forget that Lee Jung Hyun attempted to kill your father [Yoo Ran] Just a moment.. Lee Jung Hyun came.. What? I thought I was going to die. He put a knife to my throat What did you say? Whether I got hurt.. Whether I'm in shock.. Aren't you curious about that? You will only call me if you weren't hurt What did you say? I said it was the Chauffeur who told me to do it I'm going to your place, it's too scary here Where are you now? I'm still at my apartment Wait for me I'll call you when I get over there I knew something like this would happen. That's why I told you to go to Shanghai As long as Lee Jung Hyun is not caught this will happen again Do you understand what I mean now? I know But...I'm just going temporarily right? You're going to keep your promise right? Of course...wait for me Hyun Tae..Hyun Tae.. Are you ok? Did you get hurt? I'm ok It's still dangerous here.. Let's go to I was about to go over to my mother's place My brother is coming to pick me up Before we came, what did he say to you? I don't know... My thoughts are in a mess Say whatever you can think of! What did he ask you? He complained to me Why I testified against him in court What else? He asked for the Chauffeur's contact address and phone number - Chauffeur Jung? - Yes So you told him? No, I said I didnt know So he held a knife to my throat Then you came in It seems like the police are going to be busy for awhile Excuse me We need to inspect. Can I please see your identity card?

You have the potential to become someone great Ch...do you have alot of time to waste? That Chauffeur Jung didn't know something happened on the day of the murder and continued to gamble, didn't he? He's for sure obsessed with gambling And he still doesn't answer his phone Is he perhaps still gambling? First, let's go to Chauffeur Jung's house to have a look - Its in Sang goo dong, right? - Yes Soo Ah... I'm going to go crazy I'm really going to go crazy My thoughts are in a mess Soo Ah.. Why are you like this? Unni..perhaps oppa will come here? No...maybe he's here already. I have to go outside to have a look Soo Ah, are you crazy? - No, oppa has definitely come - Soo ah ya! Soo Ah... why are you like this? Grandma..I want to ask Who is it? Who is it in the middle of the night? You know who I am right? You...are... Don't move and answer my questions How did you know I was here? You don't need to know that If you want to live, then answer me truthfully What...what do you want me to say? It was you who ordered for someone to give me a phone call, right? What are you saying? Why would I do something like that? Why did you do it? There should be a reason right? Why would I do such a thing? The person that hurt the president was you The person that hit me on the back of my head was you And the person I saw in the fire was you as well Is that right? What are you saying? You should be the one who is clearest on that After Director Suh came, I left After he came, he was told off by the president and left Director Suh? Are you sure? Ah..let go of me! After the incident, I lost my job already I'm already having such a hard time. What do you want? Don't accuse a good person Why did the president yell at Director Suh? I was listening outside The president yelled at Director Suh angrily And then after Director Suh left I left as well How would I know? Was there anyone else? This is all I know! If you dare lie, you will die I can come back anytime, do you know? I know..I know I am sorry about before Sorry? About..when I said.. "A poor guy trying to get a rich girl.." I'm sorry I'm sorry I've already said everything? What's this? He's at home What did you mean? You've already said everything? That...That... That...Jung Hyun.. When? When! Just then..just then... Lee Jung Hyun! That way! Where did he go? He must be still in the vicinity Even if he escaped, he can't have gone too far There are so many police but why are there none around here Call the police and tell them to send some people over here The boss said that we have to catch him before the police does Is that important now? Go up and ask what Lee Jung Hyun asked him Yes Director Suh? Are we going to go to his house this late? If not will we find him at the company at dawn? I guess.. Looking at you I thought you were smarter If you are talking about looks I'm much better off than you, Sunbae -Hurry and step on the accelerator! - Yes! - Oh you've come, Director - Good morning - Would you like a cup of tea? - Yes, sure You are... Please be quiet There are people outside. If I was to shout..

Don't make a sound Come in..come in I thought you dont like peas.. so I made chrysanthemum tea Yes thank you I heard that the president was angry with you that day What was it about? It was business related matters Because of my mistake The company lost alot of money So he yelled at me You're not suspecting.. that I did something, right? Perhaps...I cant be sure The president was especially angry that day Looking at him who was different than his usual self I also thought there was something wrong But what the reason was.. Are you trying to say you dont know anything? Well...I wonder who does know? Ah..Maybe Secretary Cha.. Excuse me but.. Is it possible to ask Secretary Cha to come over here now? I can't do that Please! Can't you go find her later? I can give you her address I know her address as well. But it's no use I know it's too much of me to ask but..
