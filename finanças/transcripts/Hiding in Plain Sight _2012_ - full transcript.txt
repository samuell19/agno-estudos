♪ Oh, how I love Jesus... ♪ Because he first loved me... You haven't slept in three days, you need to go to sleep. I can stay up. Okay, one hour. Promise me you'll wake me. Darius! Why do bad things always happen to good people? That's me, Darius blackmon. I guess I need to take you to the very beginning for you to truly understand. That's my grandmama ida, full of fire and fight. She's been the only mother I've known and raised me since I was a little boy. And that's my beautiful wife Josie and my two kids Kendra and Michael. There's just something about being in church that seems to sooth the soul. Wee! Mr. Allan, what are you doing here? Marcus, you've missed a total of seven days of class. I know, Mr. Allan. Miss diller, I gave you a voucher to purchase a new pair of shoes for Marcus. I bought shoes with your little voucher. Where are they? Brian needed a pair so I got him some. He's four! So irresponsible, you know what went through to get that voucher? Wait just one minute. How dare I come in here trying to front me out in front of my kids! And another thing... Look, I know that boy needs an education, but I also know he needs to help me around the house. I decide who gets what around here. Now if you'll excuse me, we are late for church. - Mr. Allan, I'll try to come to school more. - Come on Marcus! Give him some praise up in here! That's right, praise the lord. Praise the lord, praise the lord. Somebody over here give me a hallelujah. Somebody over here give me a thank you, Jesus. Yes, yes, pastor. Amen. Amen, hallelujah. Hallelujah. As the deacons come, $500 from every man in the building. I know you got it. I saw you drive up in it. Oh, yeah. Oh, don't stop it now, don't stop it now. We've had a wonderful time up until now, but we're about to receive the word, amen! Give him some praise. Give him some praise, oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Come on, pastor and get this Mike. Why don't we all say amen. Amen. A good time we're having. Thank god for the testimonies and songs and then for the privilege to give in the offering. Thank you, brothers for the $500 each. I think we have to understand how much love prevails. Tell them. It is the love of god that keeps us. The love of god that holds us, that enables us to not only show love for ourselves but love for others. Yes, yes, pastor. Something in the power of god moves us in sacrificial ways that we might benefit others, so much so that we can say that not only does god's love stand as a keeping force. We ought to be able to say one to the other, nothing separates you from my love, or me from your love. All because of the keeping power of god. Is that enough to hold you? Put your wait on it, yes. I've got another old school number. Help me where you can because the lord keeps on blessing me and making the way. Hallelujah, pastor. So here as it is. ♪ It's another day's journey... ♪ And I'm glad about it... ♪ I'm glad... ♪ Oh, I'm glad... Y'all better stand to help me with it. ♪ Another day's journey and I'm glad... What are you doing in my man cave? There's a stiff penalty payment is due immediately. How was your day? Long. You know, I don't know why Marcus' mother insists on being so stubborn. You know what she did? No, what? She had the nerve... you took money out of our bank account and bought shoes, clothes, food. I could go on. I see over $500 spent on these items. Do you care to explain? I have ten businesses committed to the voucher program and the city is on board, but they're slow about processing the paperwork. So you use our income to purchase items for your students? Kevin, you can't save the world. You're not Superman. Actually, I think I favor Clark Kent. What do you think? I think this isn't funny. Okay, it's not funny. And I don't want to make a big deal about it, either. I just wanted to come home and spend a little time with my family without getting ambushed. Just tell me why this is so important to you? Daddy! What's up, bed bug? Nothing, can you read me a story? Yes, I can. What story would you like me to read? Cinderella. Okay, let's go. Sister ida, it's always good to see you. It's good to be seen. Wonderful service. - Thank you, so much. - God is good. - All the time. - And all the time. - God is good. - Yes, he is. Bless you, brother Darius, good to see you. Thank you. - Don't forget the offering. - I'm sorry? We're asking every man to give $500. Praise him, praise him, let's go. $500? Oh, you sure you don't want more? We would appreciate more, but all we're asking of every brother is $500. All right, we don't... My grandson has a good job. He makes good money, and he loves to do for the church. We're counting on you. Well, I sure am hungry, let's go, let's go. Pastor, that was a good sermon. Can the lord count on you? You can count on me, pastor. Thank you, thank you. Bye pastor, good sermon. - Go with god now. - Yes indeed. We haven't prayed over that yet, what's wrong with you? How are you going to give our last money for offering. You know we need it for gas and food. God will provide. Darius, he already had. You had to tell him you're going to give $500 in offering, really Darius? Well, who's hungry? We're starved, mama. Ready to eat. I'm sorry this is the best I could whip up at the spur of the moment. Ida, you know you're old school. You know you whipped this up on Saturday night. Whipped up at the last minute... Hush, boy. Who's going to say the blessing. Michael, baby. Okay. God is good, god is great, bless this food on my plate. Amen. You getting beside yourself, young man. You say that mess again, and I'll give you something to put on your plate. Oh, leave the child alone. He's just ready to eat. So am I. - Yes, lord. - Dig in! All right. I worked my butt off today for you. Come on! Do me a favor, don't pick me up next time, huh? Thank you for nothing. Hey, big guy, what are you doing, huh? What are you doing? - Nothing good. - Nothing good? Hey, honey. How are you? I'm good. What did you cook for me? Dinner will be ready in about five. Dinner, dinner. Babe, why don't you throw some like 13 ounce steaks on there and some mashed potatoes loaded. Yeah? You know what else? How about a warm, juicy, apple pie! Oh, that would be so great. All right, honey, I'm going to go take a bubble baths. Now y'all come back to see me more often okay? - Okay. - We love you grandma. I love you, too. And peanut. - Yes ma'am. - Peanut? Yes, ma'am. Don't stop trusting in god. Just like you taught me, mama. Love you. I love you, too. And you take good care of him. I will. Thank you, thanks for the pie, I love you. - Okay. - Peanut. Stop it, both of you. - Take care of him. - I will. Take that one with you, mama. Go on, go on with it. Love you. Make sure you lock the door. I want to hear that bolt slide, close it. Love you, mama. I hate lying to mama ida. She has a saying. It's hard being a man. I think she's right. It's hard looking someone you love and respect in the eye and tell them you lost everything. It's even harder to smile when the people you love the most know you've lost everything. So it is hard being a man and knowing the right thing to do. I just don't know what that is anymore. There's some good pecan pie. Mmm. My grandma ida made it from scratch. Picked the pecans herself. There is nothing like home made pecan pie. You see your daughter over there doing her homework at the last minute? I'll go talk to her. You need to take it easy on her. She's probably got a lot on her mind. Whatever. God knows what they go through every day. She's still got to get her education. You gonna eat your pie? Baby girl, what are you doing just now doing your homework? I don't know. Well, you can talk to me or you can talk to Sierra, which is it going to be? Daddy, it's hard. The kids at school always are making fun of me and they're calling me names. I haven't taken a shower in months. I don't know the last time I've watched TV. I haven't listened to... Enough, enough with the pity party. That doesn't excuse you for slacking on your homework. I don't want to talk to you about this again, you understand? Yes, sir. I love you, baby girl, all right? Just because we're living in our car doesn't change who we are, all right? You and your brother, you go to school, you do your chores, that's what we expect from you. Me and mommy will take care of everything else, okay? Seriously, thank you for the pie. Gotta stick together. I'll go get Michael. Michael, let's go! Round it up. What good is homework when we don't have a home to do it in? Just consider it car work, then. Don't get a big head now. Hey, everything okay? It is now. Scott and Kathy said that we were going to ahead and take watch, so we need to go ahead and get some sleep babe. Okay. Mommy, will you tell us a story later? Babe, I'm too tired. I'll tell you tomorrow. What about a song? Okay. I'll sing a song, but we need to pray first. Michael? Now I lay me down to sleep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take. God, please look after Danny and make sure he's safe. Watch over mommy, daddy, Michael, grand ma and myself throughout the night. Amen. Amen. So... I'm sorry about this morning. I didn't mean to question you, babe. It's just I was freaking out. It's okay. You're my king, and I'm always follow wherever you go. I appreciate that. I don't know why I was so scared anyway. I know god has never brought us anywhere to leave us. True that. What was that word you used to describe me earlier? What word? You know the word, that pronoun. What, peanut? ♪ Great is thy faithfulness... ♪ Great is thy faithfulness... ♪ Morning by morning... ♪ New mercies I see... Let's go. - Let him go. - I'll see you in a minute. - He'll be okay. - What is that laugh for? You just never cease to amaze me. So... I figured you'd be gone weeks ago, and look at you, you're still here. You're toughing this out. Yeah, I think it's like for better or worse, for richer or poorer, something like that. - I love you. - I love you more. I do, you know that? I love you. Well, I love you more. Do me a favor. Tonight I want you to go and get some rest, and I'll take first watch, and I'll wake Darius when it's time. I'm good. Yes. You need to go get some rest. You're the one that needs to go look for a job in the morning. A job. All right, so then just go tuck in Taylor and I'll wake you up in a couple hours. Y'all wake up. Got some cereal and some eggs and toast for breakfast. Hey, honey, honey, you want some coffee? - Morning. - Morning. - You want some coffee? - Yeah. - Tell me when. - I'm good. - You know what I hate? - What? Waking up every morning sitting on that corner waiting for somebody to pick us up. I hate it. I feel like I'm back on the block. I bet when you graduated from the university of Texas, you didn't have if your commencement speech that you'd be living on the street, did you? Neither did you. Yeah, what would you think Moore house would say knowing that their star running back was living in his car? You know when I met Josie... We were putting it on Clark Atlanta. Let me just say it like this. We must have ran for like 220 yards, three touch downs. All right, whatever. Anyway, as the bus was pulling away, I saw Josie sitting under this huge pecan tree, she was just so beautiful, man. I could just imagine myself kissing her, you know, and being happy. She put me through it. She wouldn't even go out with me at first. Really? Yeah, she had such big dreams. And look at us now. All right, since we're going down memory Lane, I'm share one. Okay. First time I met Kathy, I forgot my own name. Guess way called myself? What? Matthew McConaughey. All right, all right. No you didn't? Yeah, I swear I did. That little girl gives me a purpose, though. She just makes me... She makes me want to be a better man. There's got to be a law against keeping a Southern bell on the streets, right? I'd have to agree with you there. Aren't you supposed to make me feel better? I think there's a code there somewhere. Seriously, man, I gotta get her and Taylor off the streets. I can't do it another day. Let's go find some work today. How about that? Let's go make it a great day. Kendra, if you're finished with your bowl, put it in the sink and go wake up your dad. Hi. - Morning. - Morning. We're running late. I'll talk with you this evening, okay? Can I get a kiss from my beautiful Princess? Oh, daddy. Can I get one from the queen? We're not finished with our conversation. Love you. Love you, too. Isn't that unconstitutional? Placing a hidden camera by the American flag? Um, well, I am following all the guidelines to the patriot act. We got a six year old terrorist in our school? No, just several of the students lunches have repeatedly come up missing, and I wanted to find the culprit. Well, no cameras. You have to do it the old-fashioned way. I think we're running low on food, man. Hey, come on over. We reached our limit. Thought y'all just went to the food bank? We reached our limit. Need anybody else? Sure. You're going to get this one, you're going to get this one. Y'all need anymore help? We're really good. We can pick up things, we're strong. We're hard workers! They're not even looking at us. Look at this guy. Got it, got it. Step up, don't let these guys get it. Any of you guys know how to run a back hoe? Yeah, and I'm ready to go to work. When do you release the moon locks? Um... Before the launch code starts. You, same question. After the step glider is set. Close enough, let's go. Come on! Can we help you with anything else today? Not today. Launch codes. Really, really? What? Before the launch codes. First thing that came to mind, man. What are you going to say? Not that, I mean, I don't know. Before the rockets land on the moon, or something. That's stupid. You're in I.T., we shouldn't be on the streets. Yeah. Come on, let's go find something else. We are definitely fish out of water. Let's get a job today. - Hey. - Hey. It is hot, girl. I think I forgot how much I miss central air. I miss my summer clothes. I could just take off these clothes and run around buck naked. How did we get ourselves in this predicament anyway? I mean, we married smart men with goals, right? Yeah. Let's just say when I looked in the crystal ball, I never saw this part. Me, too. I took for granted home cooked meals for my family and sleeping in my own bed and taking bubble baths. Stop it right now. So how did it go at the work force today? It was all right. I got an interview on Friday. Good. Yeah, when I was in that interview, you know how you're waiting in the waiting area, I saw all of these candy bars in this jar. I wanted to get those candy bars so bad and just put them all in my purse. But I saw the security camera looking dead at me. I was like oh, well. I can see it now. Woman busted for stealing little candy bars. I'm going down for stealing candy bars. The boys are late aren't they? Yeah, hopefully that's a good sign. Like they got a job or something? Uh-huh. - That would be nice. - Oh, good timing. - Hey. - How are you doing? I'm good, babe. How are you? - Good to see you. - Yeah, you too. So? How'd it go? It was all right. I got an interview on Friday. That's good news, I'm proud of you. I don't know, I guess I'm just tired. I went to the salvation army and they said they're still processing our hotel vouchers, so it looks like we're gonna be still here. Maybe next week. And the week after that. You know what I was thinking? Huh? Let's just go pick up the kids from school. Thanks. Sorry it's a bit big on you. It's okay. What's going on in here? Nothing. Are you two girls smoking? No. I'm watching you two. I don't like her, she's always nosy. At least we don't her class for another two years. Let's go before miss night comes back. Thanks. What are you guys doing, are you smoking? Can I speak to Mr. Brown? Yes, he is expecting my call. Daddy. Mr. Allan with George Henry high school. Yes, this is he. Is this John brown? Oh, good, Mr. Brown. Listen, I've been trying to catch up with you to talk about the school prayer I'm starting to help keep students in school. Yeah, I isn't a package over to your office last week. Yeah, okay, I can call you then, next week. Okay, thank you. Dinner in 45. Terri? I want to apologize for taking money out of the account and not discussing this with you first. Apology accepted. Why is this so important to you? Mr. Gomez, thank you for calling me back. Yeah, I was hoping you could come in for a teacher parent conference tomorrow. Yeah, I understand you work. Can you come in tomorrow at 4? Okay, see you then. ♪ Sometimes I feel like the world's on my shoulders ♪ I think I better catch the bus ♪ 'cause today I can't afford the gas ♪ tossing and turning can't get no speed I still got homework to do.

Kathy is pretty ordinary. - Hey baby. - Hey. How you doing? Good. Still soup again today, but this time we have a real beef. What? Did somebody win the lottery? No, sir. I went down to that construction site and got picked up on the spot, and they paid me on the spot. So I figured, you know, we deserve some meat. How did it go today? Same as always. Everybody got picked except me. Hey guys, we'll take first watch tonight, all right? Okay. And um, thanks for the soup. - Of course. - Yeah, thanks. I'm gonna see about Kendra. You spilled some on me. - Hey. - Hey. You all right? I'm okay. Yeah? Can I ask you something? Yeah. Well, my best friend is having her birthday party Saturday. Do you think I can go? Let me think about that. Okay. I didn't say yes. But you didn't say no either. He's asleep. Yep. You comfortable? I am. Guess what I got? You got a job, we got meat for dinner. Remember? I got a hotel voucher. Where did you get this? I went by the salvation army just to see if it was there and there it was. Can you believe it? Oh, my god. I have to go tell Josey. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Before we do this, please hear me out. Just hear me out. We need to discuss this, okay? Discuss what? My first priority is our family. No. No! Josey and Darius took us in when no one else would and they showed us the ropes. I understand. Don't you remember they kept us from getting robbed? Honey, I understand we owe them a debt of gratitude. I do, okay? But listen to me. My first priority is to make sure you and Taylor are safe, yes. How could you turn your back on people like this? I didn't turn my back on them. Darius would do the same thing to us. - No, he wouldn't! - Yes, he would! This is so wrong! You gotta trust me with this. - No. - Yes, you do! Whether you like it or not, you have to listen to me, and you have to trust me with this. Do you think I don't want them at the hotel? Is that what you think right now? I would love to have them at the hotel right now, but guess what? If we get caught, we all go on the street, and I don't do my job to save you and him. You and Taylor are my priority. That is it! I want off the streets! I'm sick and tired of sitting on the side of the road looking for a job and never getting one! You know how it makes me feel? I feel like a loser! Honey, honey, please, I'm sorry. - It's not right. - Yes, it is. You've got to listen to me. You have to listen to me. We have to make sure our family is safe. I'll tell them in the morning, okay? Okay. I almost cracked my head on that dashboard last night trying to catch some zzz's. Here, you want some coffee? Sorry I don't have any cream or sugar. That's terrible. Wake up. Hey, we're running late. Here, take this. Share this with your sister. When's the last time you had a good night's sleep? I don't know. June. Three nights. I'm so tired, I'm starting to hear and see things. I haven't told Josey. She's got enough to worry about. I just need to find something steady. You know you can't do that. Make sure he eats something. You feeling better, buddy? Yeah. How is job hunting and everything going? Not going bad. She's got an interview this morning. That's good. I'm heading out to that t.I. Construction site. You ready for your interview? I'm ready as I'm gonna ever get. It smells like gasoline and oil. Maybe I shouldn't even... you should. I don't want to hear another word about it. Can you watch the house? Is that what we're calling it now? The house? Hey babe, we're gonna get cleaned up. Okay. The house. Yeah, I'll watch the house. One more thing. Can you stand guard tonight so I can get some sleep? I meant to tell you. We got a voucher. Yeah. I don't know how we got it but we got it. I've got to get the family somewhere safe. You know that, right? Yeah. I'm hungry. Let me see if anybody's in here. You can go first. I'll just stay out here and watch the kids. No, you have interview today. You go. I'll stand guard. Thank you. Kendra, you can't sleep out here. That's enough for now. You cannot sleep out here. Shut up, Michael. Hey, Josey? Yeah? There's something I've been trying to figure out how to tell you. What's up? That Scott and i... We got a hotel voucher. And we move in tonight. Well, that's great. Hey, if it was gonna happen, I'm glad it happened to you. Thank you. Let's go. It's great. It stinks in here! I'm tired of going in the girl's bathroom. Why can't I go in the boys? If you don't hush and wash your face. Here. You too, miss lady. Why do you always have to use the cold water? Oh, that's why. Because it doesn't work. Hurry it up. Kendra, look at your hair, sweetie. You are gonna have to start doing your own hair. You're old enough. You can't go to school like that. All right. So... Mommy look ready for work? Yep. Look like I'm gonna get a job? You look beautiful, mommy. Thank you, little man. All right, let's go get it. Come on, get the stuff. Everything okay? Okay. Come on buddy. Hey. What is this? Open it. That's so cute, baby. Thank you. You're welcome. You have a good day today. I will. You too. I gotta get them rug rats to school. Yes, do. Bye babies. Let's go get a job. Y'all go. Come on. Come on. My kids need to go upstairs. What? I'm here to see Marcus. Marcus is busy. Go on. Go on! I don't think you understand how important it is for Marcus to get an education. You think I'm dumb, don't you? Look, I may not live in some big fancy house or drive some big expensive car, but I've got my pride, Mr. Allen. Now I want what's best for all of my kids, not just for Marcus. It starts with him. If he doesn't graduate, why would his sisters or his brother? Go on. Man, what do you want from him? I am doing the best I can here. What? I don't even understand why you care. Why? I really need your help to get him back in my class. Let's work together. Thanks for stopping by. Hey, babe. Hey, hey, hey. Hey kiddos. You look all smiley today. You know me. Just smiling to keep from crying. While you're doing all that smiling, we're down to our last bit. You know, I got picked for that job today. Come to find out I need steel-toed boots. Eat your food and finish your homework, all right. Will you tell us a story later? Babe, it is Wednesday, okay? We've got to go to church tonight. Finish your food. What's going on? It just burns me up that Scott and his family got vouchers and we didn't. We were on that list before them. Why... look, you know what we tell those kids. It is not the situation that defines them. You're gonna have to do better. How you react to it. That's right. And you ain't doing good in reacting. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you, baby. My own personal James Evans. Nothing but good times. Good times. That's right. That was a show. Pastor: I think we have to understand how much love prevails and what we do for others is born out of love. And I'm mindful of what Paul says in his letter to the church at Rome in romans 8 verse 38, verse 39. Listen to what it says. He says, for I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor anything present, nor things to come, not height, not death, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in Christ Jesus. I believe that that love that holds us is the love that moves us to give as you give us, says that you are in possession and better yet that love possesses you. - Hi, dad. - Hey, baby girl. The fire's about to burn out. It's all right. You all right daddy? I'm fine, buddy. Thanks. We prayed for you. We love you, daddy. Hey, kiddos. Don't worry about it, Kyle. Let me talk to your daddy. Pastor asked about you today. What'd you tell him? The truth. And that is? Sitting in front of a fire mad at god. But I get it. I mean, there are so many times when I'm so mad I just want to kick and scream and fight, but baby, we just can't lose our faith. No, baby. I'm tired. Well, I'm tired too. The kids are tired. But baby if we just lose our faith now in god, I just don't know what's gonna happen. We just have... Josey, Josey, you don't get it. I'm a man. I got one responsibility and that's providing and protect my family. Look at us. We're living out here on the street. So I'm not doing too good, am I? I'm not just mad at god. Here I am trying to do the right thing. I'm mad at me too. I'm gonna go load the car. Stay here with your father. I'm gonna make a run we'll quick. Now where is she going? Have a seat children. Hey mommy. Hey baby. Sit down. Where's Darius? He ain't gonna be here tonight. Well, I got plenty of food left over. You know that child don't miss no meal. Okay, what's up? Talk to me. Mama, I got something I need to tell you. Darius and I both lost our jobs and we've been living in the car. Say what? We lost our jobs and we're living in the car. Don't tell Darius I told you 'cause you know he got a lot of pride. How did this happen. Remember when Darius got sick? He was sick what, for about a year or so. My salary couldn't hold us up, and the bills just kept coming in and coming in, mama. And everything that wasn't repossessed was being set on the curb. Mama, at this point, I don't really know what to do. Heck, I'm scared. Well, you are coming to live with me. No ma'am, we are not coming and living with you 'cause you know you'll get in trouble. I don't care about that. I can't have my grand babies and my great grand babies living on the street. Mom look, I know you want to help and everything, but we can't come move in here. And don't be telling everybody our business either. Especially Darius. What about friends? Well, we stayed with friends for a while and then my family even sent money, but my daddy even lost his job. I don't like it. It just doesn't seem right. Mama, they'll take our kids. I gotta go before my husband starts looking for me. No, sit down. Now listen, Darius has got too much pride. - You know... - He's just like his daddy. And but the lord has a way of dealing with pride. I mean, sometimes he'll cut you so low till he'll make you scream out. Amen to that. You can't just come in and drop a bomb on somebody like that. I'm gonna go, mama. I'm gonna go. I love you. Baby, you keep me posted. I will. I'll let you know what's going on. I still think you all should come and live with me. Well, we ain't coming to live with you. I know you mean well. Love you mama. - I don't like this. - I know. I know. Hey. Hi Michael. Where is Mrs. Armstrong? She went to the principal's office. Michael... Glad you could join us. I wanted to recognize one of our students for an exemplary performance on his spelling test. Michael, you got all of the words correct, including the bonus words. We decided that you will be representing our school for the citywide spelling bee. Okay, okay. Let's get to today's lesson plan. Everyone get out a pencil and paper. Okay class, time's up. Turn your papers over on your desk. We only have a few minutes before the bell, so everyone pick up one book from my desk on your way out. This will be your new reading assignment due by Monday. Let's go. Exit quietly, please. Kendra? Yes, Mr. Allen? Is everything okay? Yes, Mr. Allen. Why? Because your grades are starting to slip. If we don't do something to get them under control, it's gonna get out of hand. Okay. Kendra. How do you think you did on your test? I think I made an a. Good. That's a good start. Kendra, hurry up before you miss is your bus. Mr. Gomez. Glad you could make it. I had a long day. I'm tired. Can we get on with this? Did you know your son's missed a total of six days of school. Yes, I've been taking him to work with me. He broke his glasses for the third time. I told him I wasn't gonna buy him a new pair. He's gonna have to earn it. Mr. Gomez, listen. If all your son needs is a new pair of glasses, then we can help. Thank you but no. We don't take charity, Mr. Allen. Mr. Gomez, we're not talking about charity. Listen, your son needs an education to compete. Let me help you. Thank you Mr. Allen, but my son, he needs to learn value as well. When he has enough to buy new frames, then he can return to class if he wants to. What's all this? Can't a man do something beautiful for his wife. Yes, you can. Where is Kenya. At my mother's. What has gotten into you? Tonight we are having chicken breasts on a bed of rice with honey duck sauce with your personal favorite, sauteed zucchini and squash. I also baked a sweet potato pie for desert. My favorite. - Cheers. - Cheers. Mmm, my, this is good. I forgot what a great cook you are. You know you missed your calling. Glad you're enjoying it. Okay, spill the beans. What is it you want or are we celebrating? Okay. I need $300 dollars for a student. I knew this was too good to be true. You know, you frustrate me. No! What do you mean no? It's my money too. No. It's time for Kenya to come home. Terri. Terri. Y'all know what to say. All right? Just be calm. License and insurance? I got it. Mr. Blackmon, step out of the car. Why'd you pull us over? Mr. Blackmon failed to signal a hundred yards before his turn. Mr. Blackmon? Where are you heading, Mr. Blackmon? Home. We're in the process of moving. This is our last load. Can you take your hands off your gun? You're scaring my children. Ma'am, where are you guys headed? Going to our first house. It's the last load. Wait right here. I'll be right back. Do you have any alcohol in the car? No, sir. How about any weapons? Any weapons in the car? No. Just hang tight. We'll be right with you. Ask me if I have weap... My kids are in this car. Is daddy going to jail? Michael, shut up! Y'all be quiet! I gotta think! Mr. Blackmon, your license is suspended and your insurance is two days from being expired. You're under arrest. Oh, man, wait a minute officer. Come on. Wait a minute. I'm the only one in our family that works. Please, please, if you take me to jail we'll lose everything. We'll lose everything. Wait a minute. Have a heart. If you let me go, I promise I'll take care of everything. I'll get it all taken care of immediately. I promise. Mr. Blackmon, let your wife drive and get this taken care of. If I see you driving, I will take you straight to jail. Consider this a warning. Thank you. Hey. No. Why is this happening, god? Why is this happening to us? We've been faithful! We've been more than faithful! Darius! I don't know how much more of this I can take. You know god won't put too much on us that we can't bear. You know it. Stop it, Josey. Don't, okay. I know what the scripture says. But right now I'm angry. All right? I've given our tithes! I've even given our last. Darius! Where's our blessing? When is it going to turn around for us? What? Hush, baby. You're scaring the kids. What is your problem? They say that my license is expired and my insurance is going to run out in two days. Now, how do we make it then, huh? How? Darius! God can help us. No. No, no. I am not going to the church. They can help us. The church can help us, Darius. No. I'm going to get us out of this. I'll get us out of this. See, it's your pride. No. It's your pride! Do not preach to me right now, okay? Can I be mad one time? What about me getting upset? All right! What about me? Okay, Darius! Okay. I'm upset! I want to be upset! I'm trying to do the right thing! Let's go! Ah! All right. So this book... cucumbers, watermelons. How is that supposed to go in the book? I got it. David. What are you doing here? Mr. Allen, I came back to give you your book back from class. I finished it and everything. You can keep it. Okay. How is the job coming? It's okay. I still miss your class and my friends. Your dad says when you earn enough money you can come back. I hate that it has to be like that. Mr. Allen, he's not letting me come back. What do you mean he's not letting you come back? He says that I'm trying to be better than him, that if we (still lived in Mexico [car honks) That I would have been working since the age of ten. Mr. Allen, he takes my money from my glasses and uses it to pay bills. Look, I don't want to get your dad in trouble. Can you please talk to him? I just want to go back to class. My hands are tied. I remember Tanya saying something about you can probably get me some glasses. Look, I wish I could. I can't anymore. I'm sorry. It's okay, Mr. Allen. Thanks anyway. I have to go. David? I don't need it anymore.

Mr. Allen, you don't give up, do you? I need you back in my class. Why? Do you get some kind of raise if you have a full classroom? No. Marcus, you're smart, articulate and I'm always shocked when I don't hear ebonics come out of your mouth. Why? Because his mother speaks bad English? This has nothing to do with you and the mistakes you made. This is about giving Marcus a chance to grow and reach his full potential. Help me understand why this is so important to you. I used to live in a place like this. My dad got some money and moved us out of the hood. My mom taught fifth grade English and she instilled in us that the only way change can happen is not to run but by building it and cultivating it from within. That's always stuck with me. I like you, Mr. Allen. I don't know why, but I like you. I like you too, miss Taylor. What's say we get Marcus back in school together? One better. Let's keep Marcus in school together. Thank you.

No. I'll just take some milk. Did Josey already talk to you, mom? She told me something. I need to hear it from you. Drink your milk. Mom, I don't know why god is punishing me. I feel like I'm losing the respect of my family. That's nonsense. Drink your milk. God loves you and so does your family. I don't know what to do.

Glad to be back. Don't worry about them. They're just mean. Did you get a chance to read rich dad, poor dad last night? Yeah. Why does Mr. Allen give us those books anyway? Because he's a nerd. But he did give David his new glasses. I think he really tries to help. I don't think anyone can help me. Wait until I show you the mindless behavior video and dickey has a new song. It's all right, but I know how much you like him. I think he's cute. He's fine. Michael? What do you have to say for yourself? No. No. You look at me.

And now your grades are starting to slip. And to add insult to injury, you're sleeping in my class. I'm sorry, Mr. Allen. I'll do better. I promise. Okay. Write a 150 word statement of why you will not sleep in my class. After you finish, I'll take you home. I want to speak to your parents. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where's Kendra? I don't know. She wasn't outside my school. I thought she had came on. Maybe she's at the car, man. Come on. Darius, this is Mr. Allen, Kendra's homeroom teacher. Call me Kevin. Is Kendra in trouble? Can we talk in private? So how long has your family been living in your car? Six months. Are you going to turn us in? By law I'm obligated, but I really like Kendra.
