(intense violin music) (mysterious violin music) - [Man] You know, if you'd clean up around here as much as you clean that gun, this place wouldn't smell as bad. - [Other Man] We were hired to babysit, not do windows. - [Man] Well, I've got something you can babysit, this whole assignment's bullshit anyway. - I'm tired of sitting around like this. - Play nice, you two. We've got two days left, and we can all get back to our lives. - Well, damn sure time I got back to mine. - Think Mark and I have about had it. We're outta here. - [Woman] Yeah, if he ever gets out of the crapper! - [Mark] Fuck off! (gun firing) - [Woman] I'm hit! (dramatic music) - We need backup, officer down! (intense music) (gun firing) (intense music) - [Hitman] Where is he? - Where's who? - I don't like to repeat myself. - Kiss my... (gun fires) - [Officer] Hey. Hey, what's going on? Hey, you called for backup? - It's about time you guys got here. (gun firing) (dark music) (clock ticking) (phone dialing) (beeping) (explosion booms) (mysterious music) A rock in your shoe? Don't turn around. - Two, actually. - Two? - Shouldn't be a problem for a man with your reputation. - Nice try. - You can never be too careful. - You're real professional, aren't you? - First one's in Chicago. The money, and the target's itinerary are in the envelope. You have two days. So, how many hits have you done? - Oh, a senator? - Yeah. And neither hit can be connected to the Cresella Organization. Can you do that? - [Hitman] I can handle it. - You'll have to talk to Cresella about the other hit, in Albuquerque. - Who is it? - Andrew Stone. You have a problem? You know him? - No. No problem. I'll meet with Cresella after Chicago. - The driver will meet you at the airport. - You think that's a good idea? - It's all arranged. - Will they know how to spot me? - Your reputation precedes you on that one. - Well... Well, it's been nice talking to ya. Don't get up. (mysterious music) - Alright. I'll just wait here. (ominous music) Son of a bitch. (mysterious music) (drowned out speaking) (groaning) (dramatic music) - Senator. Run and get this. (gun fires) Fucker. (suspenseful music) Must be your lucky day. (coughs) Damn it! (loud rock music) (phone ringing) - [Man On Phone] Hello? - Yeah, it's Yeager. You know what's going on? - [Man] Um, I'm not sure. - You're in a lot of shit. What'd you do to piss him off this time? - [Man On Phone] What? Who is this? Are you sure you have the right number? - Yeah. There's a contract down on your life. Talk to you later. - [Man On Phone] What? (phone ringing) - [Andrew] Yeah? - Is this Andy? - [Andrew] Yeah, Andrew. Who's this? - Andy Stone? - [Andrew] Yeager! How you doin' man, I've been trying to get a hold of you, I'm getting married this weekend, I was-- - Will you shut up for a second? Man, you're in a lot of shit. This Cresella guy wants you dead. - [Andrew] Ah, screw him. Probably sick his stupid nephew on me. Man, I'll break him like a twig. - Well, supposedly he hired me to do it. What do you think about that? - [Andrew] What do you mean supposedly? - I don't know what in the hell's going on. I did another job for him in Chicago, and they tried to off me. - [Andrew] So your deal when him is off then, I mean, it's off, right? I mean, look, what if I match his price, and you just kill him instead? Yeager. Yeager. - I don't know. I've got a reputation to worry about. - [Andrew] Come on, Yeager. We go back a long way. - Yeah, and all that time, you haven't learned one damn thing. - [Andrew] Come on. Look, he's gonna be at the wedding on Saturday, we can do the whole thing there. - Look, if I do this thing, I want the 200 G's in advance. - [Andrew] In advance? Come on, you can trust me! - Andy, don't act like the punk you are. I said in advance. - [Andrew] Alright, so I'll see you on Saturday then. - I'll see you before Saturday to collect my money. And don't expect a gift either. (plane flying overhead) - Can I help you? - No, sorry. (chuckling) Just trying to get a beer. Can I get a beer? - Sure, what can I get for you? - I'll just take a Light, thanks. So, you're waiting for a plane? - Yes. - [Man At The Bar] Where you headed? - Out of town. - [Man At The Bar] Me too. Can I buy you another glass of wine or something? - I have to go now. - Good morning, I'm Erica Wade. Our top story today, New Mexico Senator Robert Watkins was assassinated last night after giving a speech at a fundraiser in Chicago. The Senator and his assistant, Glen McKay, were found dead on the scene just after midnight in the Senator's hotel room. There are reports of some eyewitnesses, but the FBI is refusing to comment on the case at this time. Now, let's go to Mike Andrews who is live on the scene. - I told ya, the guy's a genius. - This is our import? - Yeah. He'll be in today, in fact, we've gotta clean this bullshit up with Stone before he gets here. - I still don't understand why you didn't let me handle this. I'd love to pop that bastard. - We can't have this linked to the organization. We'd be catching hell for a month! - Besides, you're a hot head. You'd probably fuck it up like you fuck everything else up. - How come you let him talk to me like that? (ominous music) - Cause he's right. (laughing) - Fucking idiot. - Oh, great. - Don't worry. I know when to give up. - So I've noticed. That's attractive. - I can't take the pressure. - Sorry to hear that. - Huh? Do you have anything that'll take this away? - [Stewardess] Yes, I think I have something that can help you. - Okay. - [Stewardess] Here you go, see if these will help. - Whoa. Chiclets. I haven't seen these in years. Thanks. - Oh sure, you can keep the box. I have about five more in my purse. You'll probably need them when we land anyway. - Thanks. You want any gum? - No. (lighthearted music) - Andy, my brother's flight should be arriving at 10:45. So if you need me, page me. - Yes dear. - And, we should have dinner by seven PM so we'll have time to visit. So please, don't be late. - Babe, I've gotta work late tonight, so... I have to pass. - You're joking, right? This is really important to me. - What? - We're getting married and you haven't even met my brother yet. It's important that you two hit it off. - Well, that's up to him. Look, as far as your dinner's concerned, I'll do the best I can. Don't look at me like that, Jenny. Do I need to remind you that my job, my work, that keeps you all dolled up here with these little trinkets, living the lifestyle you're accustomed to, so I'd advise you not to forget that. - Please be here tonight. - Gotta go. - Andy... - Lipstick. - Sorry. - Great. - Sorry honey. - Is it off? - Yes, it's off. - Can I read something right quick? - I'm kind of busy with it right now. - Then can I see it when you're finished? - I don't know, you haven't been very nice to me. You know... If I didn't know any better, I'd say you didn't like me. - Well, you don't know any better. I never said that. - So you do like me. - I never said that either. - Well, you don't say much at all. - I wonder why. - I wonder why. (laughing) Sorry. - Candace. - Rick. - So, Albuquerque. Are you coming or going? - Going. My sister's getting married, I'm giving her away this week. And you? - Coming. I live there, I've been up here on business. - You travel a lot, I take it? - I go here and there. - What do you do? - Stuff, this and that. - You're there, this and that. You're pretty diverse. - I try. - [Rick] Look, Candi. - Candace. - Candace. Look, if I'm bothering you or something, I'm just trying to make conversation. - No, it's okay. I'm kind of worn out, that's all. - Well, this and that will do it to you. - Yeah. - So... How come someone like you is traveling all alone? - You just don't give up, do you? - [Stewardess] Can I get you two anything? - Actually, yes. Do you have any champagne? Or a gun? - [Stewardess] I'm sorry, we only serve champagne in first class. - Okay. How did you do that? - It's part of what I do. So, you're going to be giving your sister away at her wedding? - Yeah, she's marrying this guy I don't even know. (mysterious piano music) Jenny was in middle school at the time. She handled it well though, better than me. I kept expecting my parents to come walking through the door. It's weird how things can change so quickly, huh? - It's not easy for a child to take. (dark music) - Mommy! - Candace! Candace, honey. Don't worry, it's only a storm. Mommy and Daddy are right downstairs, alright? Stay in bed. It's almost done. (dark music) - [Father] You guys want me to get you a drink or something? - [Other Man] We're here to collect. - [Father] Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that, cause I don't have the money. - [Other Man] What do you mean you don't have the money? - [Father] Well, I tried to called you. Look, I just need three more weeks and I'll have it all, I promise. - [Other Man] We've been here before, and I left with the same promise. - [Father] Look, put the gun away, just give me a little more time. - [Other Man] We don't have any more time! - [Father] Okay, I'll have part of it on Friday, you can count on that. - We've had enough of your shit. We've been through this too many times to give you any more leeway. - [Father] Come on, don't do this. What do you want me to do, and I'll do it. (gun fires) - Do you ever hike in those mountains? Hello? Are you alright? - Whose idea was this anyway, man? I mean, everybody chews gum. - Yeah, that's what I thought when I heard it too, but tell me, when was the last time you bought Chiclets? - Well yeah, Chiclets are rare, but I mean, how am I supposed to know if someone's chewing Chiclets, or Big Red, Doublemint, Bubblicious, Dentyne. - Look. Cresella said it would be obvious. - Juicy Fruit. - Look, just quit horsing around. It'll be obvious. - Fruit Stripe. - Okay, I'm looking, I'm looking. - Hi, how are you, good to see you. - (laughs) That's gotta be him. - Wait, that guy looks like a moron. - No shit, right? You don't think a professional hitman's gonna look like a hitman in public, do you? He's got the Chiclets. - Yeah, maybe you're right. Go check him out. - Oh man, that was great. - Oh, hey, thanks. - Here, I'll take those. I'm your driver. - Oh. - Car's waiting outside. - Oh, okay. Really? - Yeah, it's right outside. Here, let me get your bag. It's right this way. Okay, that's him. - Alright, I'll be right behind you. Remember, just shut up and drive, Cresella will tell him everything he needs to know. - Alright, alright, want some gum? - Get outta here! - Hey, we're all really excited about you coming out to help us, Mr. Yeager. - What? - I said we're all really excited about you coming out to help us-- - No. What did you call me? - Mr. Yeager. - No. (chuckling) I'm Mr. Payne. - Oh yeah, sorry. Mr. Payne, I mean, code names. (laughing) - Stone will be here in a minute. Would you escort him to my office? - Yeah. - Stone's coming in here? - We just talked about that! - But I don't see the big board. - And you will keep your mouth shut. If this conversation is anything but a happy, pleasant one, I will rip your fucking head off. - Gentlemen, hope I didn't intrude on something there. - Andrew! How you doing? - How are we doing? You're looking cute. What a good looking guy. You've got a good looking bunch here. How's business? - (chuckles) I was about to ask you the same thing. - I don't have time to think about business, I have more important things to think about boys, I'm getting married in a couple of days. - What the hell do you think you're here for? God, what the hell? - No, seriously. I've been working my ass off on this thing, I'm just having a little trouble in my photo department. - Your photo department? If you've been working your ass off, how come it's already two months later-- - Hey! I'm running this meeting. Unless you want to end up shoveling pig shit, I advise you to shut up! - Never let anyone outside the family know what you're thinkin' again. - Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? - Cute. Godfather, right? Very cute. - Anyway, the passports are here. I just need a couple of days to work out this photo lab situation. It helps if you can actually see the person in the photo. You might explain that to Chewbacca here. - So, how long until we get this settled? - A couple more days, and you won't have to think about this anymore. - I think you're right. - See you at the wedding. - You got a deal. - Excuse me, but is it this far out of the city? - Oh, it's just a few more miles, Mr. Yea... I mean, Mr. Payne. I'm supposed to take you straight out to the mansion. The boss is really excited about meeting with you. - Are you sure we're not lost or something? - [Mob Member] That was a great job you did on that senator. I gotta admit though, when I saw you in the airport, that whole Chiclets thing, I mean, I thought to myself, I said, Pauley, cause that's my name, Pauley. I said Pauley, this guy's some kind of a jerk, or he's really good. - [Rick] Chiclet thing... - [Pauley] And you're good. You must've been doing this kind of thing for a while. - [Rick] Look, I think there's been some kind of mistake here. - [Pauley] You won't have any trouble with this guy, though. He's cocky but he's stupid. He's watched way too many gangster movies, if you know what I mean. Thinks he's Robert De Niro. - [Rick] De Niro? - [Pauley] Yeah, you know... You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? (laughing) It's great to be working with such a professional for once. I mean, we got guys in the family who do this stuff every once in a while. But none of them knows what the hell they're doing. I mean, I keep telling them they should let me do a job or two. You know, Roberto and them were trying to pull this job off a few weeks ago on this stooly, the kind of thing where it's supposed to look like an accident and they turned it into a real fuckin' mess, bunch of morons, those guys. You know, guys like you and me, you know, we know how this shit works. We don't end up fuckin' it up like those guys. Hey, speaking of that, if you need any help on this thing, you just give me a call. I could probably give you a few pointers if you need them. I'd love to get my hands on some of the action. You know, like I said, they never give me any of the good shit, but I got a pretty good idea how this stuff works. So, remember what I said about helping you out, just give me a call. - Welcome to Albuquerque, Mr. Yeager. - Well, good luck to you, Mr. Payne. See you later. - [Bodyguard] Mr. Cresella is right this way. - Mr. Cresella. Mr. Yeager has arrived. - Mr. Yeager. It is definitely an honor to have you working with us. Did you have any trouble getting here? Was your flight okay? - Uh, everything was great. - Good, good. - Thanks. - Mr. Yeager. - Vincent Santiago, it's a pleasure to meet you. - Hello. - Have a seat, sit down. - [Vincent] We saw your work on the news. I was impressed. When we saw that, we knew that we'd gotten the right man for the job. - Yeah, that's what your driver said. - I'll quit wasting your time. First, your initial payment. $100,000. The rest when the job is done. - Alright. Okay. Not a problem. - Good. Now, here's the guy. We'll be there. - He'll... Do you think that's wise? - Well, we're invited. Besides, I wanna be there to see that bastard's head explode. (laughing) (loud thud) Hey, it's just the door, Mr. Yeager. - Catch you off guard? - So, are you fixed for a place to stay? - Well, he can't stay here, he might... - Sorry about that. - Are you sure you don't want to stay here? We have plenty of room, believe me. - I know, and I appreciate it, but... I work alone. I'm just going to disappear into town. It's safer for both of us. - Alright. Whatever works best for you. Who am I to argue with a genius, right? (laughing) Mr. Yeager, I'd like you to meet Candace. Candace, this is Mr. Yeager. - [Candace] Hello, Mr. Yeager. It's nice to meet you. - Yeah, it's nice to meet you too. - I believe we're through talking and shouting. - Would you be interested in having a look around? - [Rick] I'd like that. - Thank you for coming, Mr. Yeager. - Thank you. - Well, follow me. - Oh, Mr. Yeager. Your money. - Right. (laughing) Right. Oh man. Candace, I... - He's a hitman? - What do you mean? - Well, I expected him to be a bit smoother, especially with his reputation. - That's it. Nobody will ever expect him. He's like the guy you never see in the movies, no one would believe it. - Did you see him jump when the door slammed? - Ah, he's fast. Hey, those quick reflexes are gonna get rid of a lot of our stress. He's already killed for us, what's the problem? - If you're a hitman, then I'm the president. - No, I'm not a hitman. I just got in the wrong car. - How do you do that? - I don't know, I was standing there at the airport waiting for my luggage, and this guy comes up to me and he says hey, we've got a car waiting for you. I mean, I thought my sister had sent it. - You didn't do anything? - No. What do I do? I mean, should I tell them? I mean, what do I do with this money? I can't keep it. - No, keep it. Don't tell them anything. If they find out you're not the right guy, you'll never get out of here alive. I can't believe you fooled them. - (chuckles) Thanks for not giving me away in there. - I wouldn't dream of it. - So, was that guy your dad, or are you two... - No, you moron. My parents were killed when I was 10. My dad worked for Tony. He's kind of taken care of me ever since. - Sorry to hear that. - It was a long time ago, I don't think about it much anymore. - How do you like living here? - I don't live here anymore, I just come by when I have to talk to Tony. - So, you are in the same line of work? - Does that scare you? - Uh... No. Not necessarily. - Good. (lighthearted music) Here's the rental car Tony got you. Just leave it at the airport when you're done. And don't worry, I'll take care of business. - I still owe you. - Don't worry about it. - No, really. How about lunch tomorrow? - Are you sure? - Why not? - I'll see you tomorrow at noon. Marta's, in Old Town. - Thank God. (lighthearted music) (car beeping) (knocking) - Where have you been? I've been so worried my stomach hurt. - Well, if you were so concerned, you could've met me at the airport. - I spent two hours there looking for you. - Did you try the gate? I need to sit down. - What kind of stupid question is that? - Really, what happened? You could've called, you could've paged me, you know, I have a cell. - I caught a ride with some friends. They just took me on the scenic route. - What are you talking about? - Nothing, you don't want me to go into it. So, this is your place. - Mhm, it's Andrew's. I moved in about six months ago. - [Rick] Pretty wealthy, huh? - He does alright. - So, what does he do? - You know, stuff, this and that. - Yeah, I hear this and that's a pretty lucrative profession these days. So, tell me about this guy. How can you marry someone without introducing him to me first? - You'll meet him tonight. He should be home soon. He's usually pretty stressed out when he gets home from work, so don't rake him over the coals too hard, okay? - Well, I've been to one World's Fair, a picnic, and a rodeo, and that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard come over the radio. - I was just saying, sometimes you have a hard day at work. - Well, I don't think he needs to meet me now, since you've obviously given him complete rundown of my character. - Andy, I was just saying-- - So, Andy... - Andrew. - Nice to meet you, Andrew. I'm Rick. - Yeah. Nice to meet you too. So... When do we eat? - [Jenny] It'll be ready in a while. - Did you touch it? - [Jenny] No. - Touch what? - [Andrew] My VCR. (light jazzy music) - I sure am glad I can come out here for the wedding. - Yeah, it's gonna be fun. - It's a nice place you have here. - It's not bad. - Where is it you work? - I'm self-employed. Wouldn't have it any other way. - What is it you do, exactly? - You know, stuff. This and that. - [Jenny] Honey, you must've had a pretty busy day at work. You were home even later than usual. - [Rick] So, Andrew. You got a lot of family coming in for the wedding? - No. Not really. I have more business associates than family. - [Rick] Do you have brothers and sisters? - No, it's just me. - [Jenny] Honey, Jessica. - Oh, yeah. I got a sister, Jessica. - She's gonna be in the wedding, she's one of the bridesmaids. - So, when do I get to meet her? - She probably won't be around 'til the wedding. - So, why don't you guys tell me about your honeymoon? - Hun, why don't you fill that one, okay? I had a wonderful evening, but this wasn't it. (light jazzy music) - Here you go. - Thanks. - Can I get you anything to drink? - Yeah, can I get some iced tea please? - Sure, be right back. - Thanks. - There you go. - Thanks. - Can I take your order? - Actually no, I'm waiting on someone. - Alright, take as long as you need, and call me when you need me. - Okay, thanks. (lighthearted music) - You sure you're not ready to order, sir? - Uh, no, I'm still waiting. - Alright. (lighthearted music) - So, what are we doing here, man? You guys need my opinion on something or what? (laughing) - Yeah, yeah, that's it Paul. We've gotta show you some stuff. - Yeah? Like what? - Like this. - What the hell? What the hell did I do, man? What's this about? - You talk too much, Pauley. - Yeah! - How many times do I have to tell you about keeping your mouth shut? We pay you to drive that's it, drive! - Yeah, asshole! - Would you shut the hell up? - What, what are you talking about man? When? - The hitman, Pauley. The hitman. You were supposed to drive, not tell him every fuckin' thing you know. - I was just making conversation, man. You know, just talking to the guy. - Talk to this, asshole! - Okay, okay man. I won't talk to nobody again. I promise. Won't happen again. - Ah. I've heard that shit before, Paul. I'm sick of it. - Well, what are you gonna do, Santiago? I mean... What are you gonna do? - I think I'm gonna help you apologize.

(laughing) You're kidding me! - No, I'm Sharon, sorry. - But you look just like her. - Well that's why they call them twins. - Okay. I'm sorry. I'll leave you alone. I'm sorry. (dark music) She loves me. She doesn't love me. She doesn't even like me. She doesn't even remember me. So, real smooth. - You could've gotten me killed. - [Rick] What? - I don't think I could've covered the losses if they had walked. You are a walking disaster area. - So it was you. - Who the hell do you think it was? You should've waited until I was finished. - You stood me up! I was sitting there for over an hour, and you're floating around like the Don's daughter. - What was I supposed to do? Say hold the cashier's check while I go make sure my lunch date hasn't turned into an adolescent, I'll be right back. - [Rick] Yeah, whatever. - After all I did to cover your ass, Mr. 100,000 bucks, I think you should at least give me the benefit of the doubt. Now this isn't gonna sound good, but I have to leave. (laughs) Rick, I really would like to see you again. Tomorrow? - What an offer, how can I refuse? - Meet me at the base of the sky tram at one o'clock. - I'll check my schedule. - Well, I'll be there. I hope you are too. I really am sorry about today. Really. (lighthearted music) (TV blaring) - Jenny, we need to talk. - Talk about what? - About you marrying this guy. Have you really thought about it? - (chuckles) Excuse me? - Well, I think you should reconsider marrying this guy. There's something odd about him. I mean, you don't even have an engagement ring. - He said he was gonna cut and size it, he said... You know, I just knew you'd do this, I just knew it. Why are you always like this? - Jenny, what does he do? - [Jenny] I don't know, it doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter? You're gonna spend the rest of your life with this guy and you don't care what he does? I know I've seen him somewhere before, probably on a wanted poster at the post office. - (chuckles) Rick, grow up. There's nothing to worry about! - I'm not convinced of that. - Well then don't marry him. I mean, you've hardly even talked to him. - I've talked to him enough. - Rick, I asked you here today to give me away at my wedding. You can either do that, or go home. Those are your only two choices, okay? But make a decision soon, because we have to go get your tux tomorrow. (lighthearted music) So, how do I look? - Uh, turquoise? - Yes. - You look good, very good. You gonna have fun? - Yes, so excited. - Oh, I wish your sister could've been here tonight, all my bridesmaid's are gonna be there. - I guess she's busy, hun. - Hm, yeah. Well, I've gotta go touch up my lips. (blows kiss) - You almost ready? - Mhm. Okay. (thunder rumbles) (saxophone music) - Did you miss me? - What the hell are you doing here? Jenny hasn't left yet. Get outta here! - I thought you told me to be here right now. - No, look, look. You're gonna have to go. - Where am I supposed to go? - Look, just... Come here. - What, what are you doing? I'm not going down there, no way. - [Andrew] Just get down. - [Redheaded Woman] There is no way I'm fucking off this damn balcony. - [Andrew] Would you be quiet? - [Jenny] Andy, where are you? - I'm out here on the patio, Jenny. Oh, you're still here. - [Jenny] I'm about to leave, I'll see you in the morning. - Have a good time. - Muah. - Okay, come here. How's everything going? - Good. - [Redheaded Woman] Shit. - Give me a kiss. - Muah. - You're so pretty. - Thank you. - I'll see you, okay? - Have a good time. - Okay. - Bye. - [Jenny] Bye! - Shit. (panicked groans) - How's it hangin'? - [Redheaded Woman] Stone, get me up now! Shit! Come on motherfucker, now. Ow. - Come on. What language. Come on.

Let's see if we can't work on this, let's talk about it. - Well... I don't dislike you, I just haven't seen anything special between you and her. - [Andrew] (chuckles) I know I come across harsh at times, I want to let you know I do care for your sister. - I'm sure you do, I just don't-- - [Andrew] Listen, she's gonna be taken care of, okay? I guarantee that. No need to worry. - What is it you say you do, again? - Importing. - [Rick] Importing what? - You name it. Look, I don't want to bore you with details. - Why not? I mean, I'd like to know what kind of lifestyle my sister's getting involved in. - What do you mean "lifestyle"? Lifestyle's right here. Got a nice house, Jenny's gonna be well taken care of, she won't have to worry about anything, she can go get her nails done, go toolin' off with her little girlfriends at the country club, and I'll be here worried about the important shit. - I just think she would be better off-- - Well let me put it to you another way. You keep your nose out of my ass, or you're gonna find my foot in yours. I'm gonna marry your sister, not you or anyone else is gonna stop me. You got it? Now, if you tell your sister that this conversation was anything but a nice, happy, pleasant one, I'll rip your fuckin' head off. Comprende? (mysterious music) - [Jenny] Ow... - What are you doing? - Mm, oh. - What are you doing? - Just let me lay here for one second please. - You've been drinking. - Nope. (chuckling) Well, okay, maybe a little bit. - Yeah, a little. Hey, I'm sorry about being such a jerk this afternoon. - Really? Aw. - Oh... - Muah! (laughing) - You're so wasted. - Not so much. - Come on, let's go see what's in the fridge. - Just let me lay here for one second, please? - Come on, let's go. - Okay, just one second. Just give me one minute. (piano music) (yawning) I hope he remembers to pick up his tux today. - Mm. Mm... Oh, I love the smell of java in the morning. - What'd you say? - Nothing. Just talking to myself. - Oh... God. (loud sip) - Ah, it takes like napalm. - How'd you like my gourmet coffee, isn't it delicious? - Yeah, it's great. (chuckling) What? - I knew you'd like it. Come on, let's go get dressed and go get your tux. - Okay. - Okay. - How do I look? - Looks good. Everything looks good on you, sis. (chuckles) - I still can't believe she bought that. - Well it's all in the delivery. - You're such a sneaky bastard. - You think so? Mm. - Do you mean to tell me that she doesn't have a clue? - Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. (chuckles) (relaxing music) - I wasn't sure you were gonna make it. - Well, just happened to be in the neighborhood. - I bet you were. - So, you ever been up on one of these things? - Tony used to take me up when I was a kid. That was years ago. - What, you get tired of it? - Yeah. But it's a good place to take tourists. - (laughing) My sides. Well, let's do it. ♪ If you could look at what ♪ ♪ My luck has brought me now ♪ ♪ You'd find a situation ♪ ♪ And I know how ♪ ♪ Mistaken identity ♪ ♪ They thought their man was me ♪ ♪ Collecting someone's reward ♪ ♪ To knock some guy off, oh Lord ♪ ♪ Now I'm not really one ♪ ♪ To go kill someone ♪ ♪ But since I have to ♪ ♪ I'm glad to do the hit with you ♪ ♪ I'd do anything to kill someone with you ♪ (phone ringing) - [Andrew] Hello, hello? - You sure left in a hurry this morning. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Well, don't forget to pick up your tuxedo. - What? - Do I need to go get your tux for you? - [Andrew] Well, I'm tied up right now, hun. - Oh. You gonna be tied up all day? - Uh, yeah. Uh, hey... Listen, I'm gonna need to fill in the blanks here on this here project that drew up for me here, so let me just get back to you on that. Okay? I'll talk to you when we get home. - [Jenny] Well, call me sooner if you get a chance. - I'll try. - [Jenny] Okay, bye honey, I love you... - (chuckles) You made that tough, very tough. - Well, how is the princess? - Mm, the Princess Bride is fine. - Choose. - What? - A letter. - Oh, um... G. The Graduate. - You are so very wrong. (chuckles) - I like that. Fisher King? (laughing) Gone with The Wind? - Wrong, that's wrong, very, very wrong. Okay, come on, try again. (wistful acoustic music) - Oh. Guess you're not too ready for hiking today, huh? - Well, I couldn't take you to a five star restaurant dressed like that, could I? - Touche, touche. (wistful acoustic music) Oh man. That's amazing. You tired? - Yeah, my feet are killing me. - Well, I happen to be an expert at back massage. Give me yo feet. - Mm, that feels good. - So peaceful up here. I could live up here forever. What are you doing for the next 20 years? - You're funny. Could you do my back now? You were right, you are good at this. - I'm an expert at other things too. - Yeah? Like what? Close your eyes. (wistful acoustic music) - Oh my... (laughing) Oh my God. - [Candace] So, I guess I didn't have exactly what you'd call a "normal" childhood. But Tony took good care of me. I really couldn't ask for a better situation. I mean, he's not the greatest father figure, but as far as mob bosses go, he's one of the nicest you'll ever meet. - Yeah? - You haven't heard a word I've said, have you? - Yeah, parrot that died. - No. My parents died when I was 10. - Oh. How sad. - Nevermind. - No, I'm interested. - You really want to hear about it? - Yeah. Were you there when it happened? - Yeah. I remember waking up because of a storm. My mom came into the room, told me to go back to bed, it was only thunder. But I heard yelling, and I was curious, so I got out of bed. - You know we can't let you slide this time if you don't help us out. - [Father] Just give me a little more time. - We've been through this too many times, I've had enough of your shit, we can't give you anymore leeway. - [Father] Come on, don't do this, what do you want me to do, and I'll... (gun fires) (screaming) - My God! - Now! You calm your ass down, or we'll do the same thing to you. (screaming) (gun fires) (dark music) Andy! - [Andrew] Andrew. - [Yeager] What the hell did you do that for? - [Andrew] She wouldn't shut up. - [Yeager] Andy, you stupid bastard. - Come on, you were gonna shoot her anyway. - She's the only one that could help us get to Cresella. Now without her, we're screwed. - [Andrew] Tell me, what was going on? - [Yeager] Come on, let's get out of here. Andy. - [Andrew] Andrew. Andrew, Andrew. - Andrew Stone. Oh my God. Oh my God. - What? - I have to go. Have fun at the wedding. - Call me. (mysterious music) (TV blaring) - [TV Narrator] Obviously, the mating habits of the lion are quite different from those of humans. - Okay. Okay, alright. Jenny, thank you. Alright, thank you. - You know, I always wondered what you were like when you were a little boy. I bet you were a little bastard. - [Andrew] Actually, I was raised with a very strict code of honor. - Oh, really? - That's right. My daddy taught me to get on her and stay on her. (chuckles) I always tried to do what my daddy told me. - Mm. He must be so proud. - He's dead. - [TV Narrator] Lion sex can be pretty messy. And the passion... - [Andrew] I think there's a need for some rearrangement on this wedding thing, I'd like to face the crowd. - Why? - Cause I'd like to see that bastard's head explode. (laughing) Man, I'd like to see his face when he figures out it's him who's getting blown away instead of me. I wish I could see that. - Well, I could take a picture for you. - That would be nice. Hey, look, we're gonna have to chill for a while once this is over, alright? So, let me call you. Don't be coming around the house, or talking to anybody, got it? - But what about after the hit? Are you gonna go through with the ceremony? - What do you mean? - The wedding. Are you still gonna get married? - We all have to make our little sacrifices. Look, haven't you ever seen the gangster films? Men in my position have to marry wholesome, respectable women. Perfect for carpool. - And I guess I don't fit that bill of sale. - No, you don't. (organ wedding music) (intense music) - Who says videotape is worthless? (wedding organ music) - [Tony] We'll be there, and we're invited. (dramatic music) - Rick... - What'd she say? - Nothing. (organ wedding music) - How the hell did he do that? I can't believe this guy, he's incredible. - Please be seated. We gather in the presence of God to give thanks for the gift of marriage, to witness the joy together of Andrew and Jenny. - [Andrew] Business associates. - [Jenny] He's usually pretty stressed out when he gets home from work. - [Andrew] I know I come across harsh. Self-employed. (loud commotion) - [Jenny] You know, stuff, this and that. - [Andrew] You know, stuff, this and that. - [Candace] You know, stuff, this and that. - Rick. - Huh? I do. I do. - [Priest] Very good. Marriage is a most holy covenant that should not be entered into lightly. Matthew, Chapter 19, Verse 3 through 6. At that time, the Pharisees came to Jesus tempting him and saying is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause? Who, answering, said to him... Have you not read he who made man from the beginning... (intense music) And that he said, this cause shall man leave his father, and shall leave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. Therefore, they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore God have joined together, let no man pull apart. This passage speaks of the everlasting bond that is marriage. It will be broken only by death. It is an institution able to withstand the heavens and the stars. (coughing) - [Candace] Rick. - Oh my! Candace. - This is your sister's wedding? I don't believe this. Do you know who the groom is? That's the guy you're supposed to hit. - [Rick] I think I figured that out. - He's the one that killed my parents. - [Rick] And he seemed so nice. - What? - Wait a minute. He's the one that killed your parents? He's about to marry my sister. - That's what I'm saying. - Son of a bitch. - Rick, you have to kill him. - Me? Why me? - I can't. I'm supposed to be sitting with Cresella, they're probably getting suspicious already. What about your sister? - What about her? - Are you just gonna leave her here? Rick, there are men all over this place who think you're a killer. You try to leave, you'll get us all killed. - I've hardly ever used a gun. - Yeah, well you understand that when you pull the trigger, a little metal ball called a bullet comes flying out? Just make sure that bullet's headed towards Stone. - I can't do this. - You have to! Listen, Rick. That guy that killed my parents is in there. If you don't kill him, they could kill us all. How are we gonna protect your sister then? (suspenseful music) Now go blow his head off. (suspenseful music) God, why do I have to do everything? - God, please don't judge me by the fact that the only time I've been to church in the last 10 years, I wind up killing somebody. I swear I won't do it again. (intense music) (drowned out speaking) - [Priest] Your life will be full of joy, and the home which you are establishing will abide in peace. No other ties are more tender, no other vows more sacred than those now. If any person should have just cause as to why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony, let them speak now or forever hold their piece. (guns firing) (loud screaming) (sobbing) (suspenseful music) - Cresella, Stone, both dead. If you've got fingers on the trigger, take them back to the line, we can avoid a massacre here. They are dead, right? - [Yeager] Whoa. Now little lady, you don't wanna use that thing. (intense music) - I killed him, oh my God, I killed him. What did you do, man? What are you thinkin'? - Right there, right there, get, get! (tires screeching) - Oh, Jenny. Shit. (intense music) Okay, okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Okay. Here we go, Rick. Okay, nobody move! I'll blow her head off! Come on, come on Jenny, come on. - No! - Come on, come on! I'll blow her head off, I swear! Come on! Come on, Jenny. Come on! Nobody move, I'm serious! - Disaster boy. - Come on, baby. Gotta go. - Oh my God. - [Rick] I know you don't wanna go, come on. (sobbing) (whimsical music) (sobbing) - [Jenny] Rick, please. - What the hell are you doing? - Get in the back. - What is going on? - Jenny, just get in the back, listen to her. - Get in the back. - What the hell's going on? - I'm cleaning up your mess again. - Again? What are you talking about? - If you hadn't busted in with your little vigilante act there, everything would've been just fine. - Oh, just fine? I-- - Do you have the money? - Yes. - Then drive. - Yes. - Then go. - Rick! - You are a terrible shot. - No! - [Rick] What? - [Jenny] What? You shot my husband? - [Rick] Look, Jenny, the guy was a criminal, I mean, he was a murderer. - [Jenny] No! - [Candace] You didn't shoot him. - [Rick] Excuse me? - [Candace] You didn't shoot him. - [Rick] Of course I did, I had the gun, I was right there! Hello? - [Candace] I shot him, you idiot. You couldn't hit the side of a barn. - [Rick] What are you talking about, I had the gun, I'm the one that was-- - [Candace] I'm telling you, I shot him. (sobbing) - [Rick] Jenny, honey, the guy was a criminal. I mean, you don't want to be mixed up with someone like that. - [Candace] Oh, you don't want to be mixed up with a criminal? What the hell do you think I've been doing for the last 10 years? - [Rick] No, no, no, no, no. That's not what I mean. - [Candace] You don't wanna get mixed up with a criminal. - [Rick] No, no, that's not what I mean, that's not what I meant. - [Candace] Do you think you would've gotten out of this thing if I didn't know what I was doing? - [Rick] Yes. I mean no, I don't know. - [Candace] I think you're pretty damn lucky I was here. - [Rick] Of course, I just meant Candace-- - [Candace] You got a hundred grand and a nice car out of this, and you're talking bad about criminals? - [Rick] No, no, no, I just meant that it was-- - [Candace] I can't believe your attitude. - [Rick] Candace, no, no, no, no. I just meant that-- - [Candace] God, will you shut the hell up? - [Rick] Jenny, please, please! Calm down, calm down. Calm down. (sobbing) - [Jenny] No. (dark rock music) (mysterious music)
