I feel just like I always do. MAN: So Bobby, are you new in town? Um, no, sir. I've been here all my life. Just been sort of, um... well, invisible. [GIGGLES] NED: Well, uh, welcome to the material world. BOBBY: Well, thank you, sir. You made this bread? Oh, bread's a hobby of mine. I can just about do it in my sleep. Yow. So, what's your father do, son? Oh, he's a teacher, over at Fillmore. And your mother, does she work? No. I mean... she died last year. Oh, I'm so sorry. You shouldn't be sorry.

[SIGHS] Your father took me to see this on our second or third date. * Come down on your own * BOBBY: Blessings on our Friday. JONATHAN: What do you want to do? Something huge.

I guess we let things get... I mean... It's just love, man. It's just...love. We got carried away, and I think we should stop. I mean, pretty soon, we'll be out of high school, and then we'll be in college, and I want to go to college in a big city. You're gonna go away? As soon as I can. You're awake. I just... Um, I wanted a drink of water. I couldn't sleep either, so I decided I might as well do something useful. Maybe I shouldn't stay here anymore. I'm not innocent in all this, Bobby. I can't pretend to be. I honestly don't know what to do. I'm supposed to be the mother. I'm the adult here. And I honestly don't... have the slightest idea what to do or say to either one of you. I should go... I guess. Want to learn how to bake a pie? Huh? Sometimes it's good to just do a simple, useful thing. I don't know. Well, I haven't rolled out the second crust yet. It's not like bread dough. You mold that until it comes to life. Pie crust is just the opposite. It needs kid gloves. You handle it as little as possible. You'd be surprised how easy it is once you learn a few of the tricks. Just coax it. That's right. That's good. That's very good.

[LABORED BREATHING] ...you can't...move... to Arizona with Alice and me. Son, you're 24. You can't just live with us forever. I know. I mean-- Time to get out in the world a little, huh? JONATHAN'S VOICE: No one's home. Leave a message. [MACHINE BEEPS] Hey, um, Jonnie... Um... Sorry, man. I'm not used to these things. I'm calling to tell you... Well, to ask you, really... You see, Ned and Alice are moving to Arizona, and... I'm just...here. To tell you the truth, man, I'm not sure what to do. It seems like... I've just been... baking for so long.

Bobby, Clare, about whom you've heard... so much. Hi. I am so glad to finally meet you. Me too. You. Thanks for letting me, you know, crash here for a while. Well, come on. Grab your things, get settled in. Come, Jonathan. Wow. I like a little respite from all the décor. You want to... go out to dinner? You want to unpack first? I mostly brought, you know, records. Let's go out. Okay. Have fun, boys. JONATHAN: You come too. Well, I... No. You guys need a little time alone, I think. No, really. Come. Okay. I'll just put on my other eye, and we're out of here. MALE SINGER: * 1989 * * Really is that far away * * And I wouldn't care * * Had I not the fortune To be shown the history... * Bobby is adorable! He is, isn't he? In his Bobby way.

Yeah. * We're soaked All the same * * Questioning what We've always known * Come on! Whoo! * Here I reconcile * * The difference between * * My concern... * Tomorrow, I'm taking you up to Central Park. Inside a week, you'll have the whole city figured out. Hey, man. What? You got a tattoo. Oh. Yeah, years ago at NYU. I thought I could be the kind of person who'd have a tattoo. Cool. Bobby... Uh-huh? I feel like there are things we should talk about... but I'm not sure what to say. What things? [LAUGHS] You know, when we were kids... What we used to do. Oh. Man, we were kids. So, um... are you seeing anyone in Cleveland? Nah. I was just, you know, working, hanging out. How about you? You seeing anybody? No. No one in particular. [***] Hey, man. Look what someone was throwing out. Hey, Leonard C. Right out there on the street along with some dead spider plants and macramé. How many times did we get stoned to this? I lost count. Hey, man, I'm making lasagna. We could knock off a bottle of Chianti and listen to "Suzanne," like, 10 times. Sorry, I've got a date. No problemo. Save some for me. Uh-huh. You have to promise to make this, at most, once a year. Bobby, if I weigh 300 pounds, I won't be able to get up the stairs. Too bad Jonathan has to miss it. Well...Jonathan has other priorities. And it was the best. We were out of our minds. JONATHAN: You had a good time? Oh, the best. The best. You know how sometimes it seems like the DJ knows you? Uh-huh. That's what I'm talking about. [LEONARD COHEN'S "SUZANNE" PLAYING] * Suzanne takes you down... * This is one of my sadness albums. After my divorce. You were married? Years ago. He was a sadistic drug addict, and I was, um... well, a masochistic aspiring drug addict. It made sense at the time. Where did you meet him? Want a real laugh? Woodstock. You were at Woodstock? Like...the concert? Well, I don't tell just anybody, Bobby. What was it like? Muddy. You never seen so much mud. I felt like a pig. I was attracted to Denny because he had a huge bar of Lifebuoy soap down at the pond. Yow. Hey. Have you ever heard Steve Reich? No. It's one of my favorites. Listen. I just sort of catch whatever happens to blow through. ["SUZANNE" CUTS OFF] [STEVE REICH'S "SECTION VI FROM MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS" PLAYING] ["SECTION VI FROM MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS" CONTINUES] [DOOR CLOSES] Hey, beauties. CLARE: Hello, dear. You're home early. Yeah, I was having a little less than maximum fun. Well, as you know, we always leave the porch light on for you. Love that. Jon, Jonnie, have you heard this guy? Steve Reich. Oh. Sure. He's great. He's amazing. He's just... He's... Where'd you find him, anyway? He found me. [LAUGHS] Well, he's a welcome addition to the household. Bobby, you're gonna have to find a job, aren't you? Well, I'm a baker. You think a New York bakery would hire me? Honey, in New York, someone will pay you to do just about anything. I mean, if I can make a living making hats... She doesn't exactly make a living making hats. She picks up a little change that way. That is not true. I do have some money left over from my grandfather, but I've stashed it away for when the baby comes. You're having a baby? Didn't Jonathan tell you? It, uh... It hasn't come up. I didn't know you two were, um-- Lovers? We're not. Most parents aren't lovers. Mine weren't. I know this must sound a little... A little what, darling? A little free? A little great? A little like insisting on our own happiness, even if it's not what people ordinarily do? Well... Babies. I mean, hey, let's have a dozen. [BOTH LAUGH] Shit, you scared me. Sorry, man. What are you doing? I get up and walk around in the dark sometimes. Does that weird you out? No. I don't know. When the place is all dark... When you and Clare have gone to sleep, and I'm awake... it's like being alive and being dead at the same time. You know? It's this sort of halfway thing, where the people who are alive are dreaming, and the people who are dead are... where they are. And I'm here... in the dark and the quiet. You want some water? Sure. [SIGHS] Hey... Are you and Clare really having a baby? Oh, God. I don't know. We've been talking about it. It's something she really wants. [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [***] I like Clare. So do I. [CAR HORN HONKS] Bye, Lacey. See you. We can take it from there if we need to... Perfect. And on the Thursday ad-- Oh, shit, I gotta go. Can you, uh--? Yeah, yeah, I got it. Thank you. Bye, Jonathan. Bye. MAN: "Don't let it worry you," said the cameraman. "Even De Mille couldn't see anything looking through the wrong end," so that was the first-- Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grown-ups? You've heard it. About the time I looked through the wrong end of the camera finder. Remind me to tell you about the time I looked into the heart of an artichoke. Hey... is your name Dirk? No, I'm Jonathan. Oh. I'm sorry, I just... you look like someone I know named Dirk. I'm Wes. JONATHAN: Hey, Wes. These are my friends, Clare... and Bobby. Pleasure, Wes. Hey. So, Jonathan, Bobby and I'll see you later. I thought we were all having dinner together. All right. I'll see you later. Yow. Do you know what I think? Now, can Clare be absolutely honest with you? Uh-huh. I think you need a new haircut. Really? Mm. You're so handsome, and that hippie do does absolutely nothing for you. I don't know. I never really, you know, think about it. Well, I do. See, here's the thing. You don't quite look like yourself this way. You know what I'm saying? If you walk around looking like someone other than who you are, you could end up getting the wrong job, the wrong friends, who knows what all. You could end up with someone else's whole life. I think this is my life. It doesn't seem like somebody else's. Check. * They can't hurt you now * * Can't hurt you now * * Can't hurt you now * * Because the night Belongs to lovers * * Because the night Belongs to lust * * Because the night... * What do you think? I look so... Dangerous? Sexy? Stripped-down, ready for action? That's not what I was thinking, exactly. Well, you are definitely gonna start turning heads around here now. Bobby... What do you like about me? What? Do you... Do you like me? I like you. Of course I like you. I mean, could you... You know, do you have... God, I can't believe you're gonna make me say it. Do you think I'm attractive? Oh. I, uh... That's what I thought you were gonna ask. And, yes, I... Absolutely, I do. Good. That's good. Well... there's just no smooth or sophisticated way to do this, is there? Clare... Shh, shh, shh, shh. No, listen. You talk too much, darling, and if you don't shut up, I will come to my senses and realize how utterly stupid and self-destructive this is. I have to tell you, I've never... you know, done this before. Pardon me? I've never... you know... Never? No. Does that freak you out? No. I mean, yes, of course it freaks me out! Jesus Christ. I guess maybe we should stop. Maybe. Because, you know... I may not be the most, like... adept. Oh, honey. You think I'm upset because you might not be adept? Is that what you think? No. I guess. Okay...junior. Mama's gonna teach you a thing or two. Are you nervous? Uh-huh. Don't be. This is the most natural thing in the world. All right. [GRUNTS] [SOBBING] It's all right. [DOOR OPENS] JONATHAN [MUFFLED]: Hey! Sorry I missed dinner. Where is everybody? [***] [DOOR SLAMS] Hey. Jonnie... Are you okay? Mm-hmm. Are you okay? I guess. You should go back to Clare. Nah, man. I don't want to leave you alone. I mean... [EXHALES SLOWLY] You should... go back to Clare. Really. Bobby? [***] Hey. Bobby, wakey, wakey. Oops! I am not here. You never saw me. I'm just the cleaning lady. So sorry. You were in bed. We tucked you in at 2 a.m. I went out again. Fun? Sort of. Potential? I don't think so. [PEOPLE CONVERSING IN HUSHED TONES] [SIGHS] So, what'll we do now--? Oops. See you later, babies. Jonnie... Oh, it's entirely fine. There's a whole world full of art boys just outside. Jonathan... No worries. Love you. [MOZART'S "SOAVE SIA IL VENTO" PLAYING] Hey, man. What are you doing up here? Some queen next door's got Mozart cranked. I couldn't tear myself away. Opera, huh? Clare loves you. I love Clare. Doesn't this all seem sort of strange? No, man. It's perfect. Just like this. Bobby, I'm starting to feel a little extra. You're essential, man. [CHUCKLES] Mm-mm. Hey. Let's dance. You can't dance to opera. You can dance to anything. What are you doing? A little kiss between brothers. Nothing wrong with that. Jon? Jonnie? Clare! Clare, wake up! What? [SIGHS] [WHISPERS] Jonathan... you asshole! God. We gotta find him. Honey, he isn't lost. He left. It's my fault. This is not true. No, you don't... You don't understand. Shh. Bobby, this is a problem of Jonathan's. Trust me. There's something fucked up about me. There is nothing fucked up about you. You don't know. ALICE: Hello? Hi, Alice? Bobby, is that you, honey? Listen, I don't want to worry you, but I was wondering, have you heard from Jonathan? Oh, yeah, of course. He's right here. Do you want to talk to him? He's there? Great. Yeah, put him on. Bobby, I'm sorry. It looks like he's gone to bed already, but I'll tell him you called, okay? Tell him Clare and I are fine, okay? Okay, sweetheart, I will. Bye-bye.

Well... here I can... more or less, breathe the air. And your mother's learned how to make blue margaritas. [LABORED BREATHING] Whoever expected to end up living in the desert? Yeah, whoever expects to end up living anywhere? That's...too deep for me. * Something somewhere * * And what's left behind * * When each evening ends? * * Roads to where we've been * * All your wishes... * How's that? Looks a little bit like me, doesn't it? [TELEPHONE RINGING] We're not speaking to anybody right now. [ANSWERING MACHINE CLICKS] BOBBY'S VOICE: Happy holidays. Celebrate, all you people. [MACHINE BEEPS] ALICE: Hello, Bobby. This is Alice. Sweetheart, there's something I have to tell you. * All your wishes For something somewhere * Oh, look at you. And this is Clare. Oh, Clare. So wonderful to finally meet you. Thanks for coming. Thank you for having me. Alice, sorry. [DISHES CLATTERING] Alice? So clumsy. I'll get it. Oh, it's all right. They cost $1.98 at K-Mart. Oh... [DISH SHATTERS] Alice? Do something for me. Anything. Hold me. Just hold me. Okay. Tighter. Don't be gentle with me. Squeeze me harder. Harder. Make me feel like you're breaking my ribs. Oh, God... I can't. I don't wanna hurt you. I love you. You're an angel. JONATHAN: Mom? I'll be right there, honey. JONATHAN: Anybody want a drink? BOBBY: Okay, sure. CLARE: Okay. Hey. I'm sorry about-- Well...all this. I, uh... I knew I'd see you both again. I just imagined... well... different circumstances. It's okay. It's okay. Ned, man. He was a trip. He was like my father too. You would have loved him, Clare. CLARE: I'm sure. Bobby? If you want my family so badly, I hereby bequeath them to you. No. No, better yet, I hereby bequeath you my whole, entire life. Be me. I hereby dub you Jonathan Glover. Tomorrow, when they cremate my father's body, you can be the son, and I'll be the best friend. You can come back from the service and you can console my mother. Jonathan, stop it. Stop it. You're better at it than I am. You're better qualified. So go, go at it. Be their son, with my blessings. Listen to me, you little shit. All he's ever done is worship you, and all you've ever done is walk out on him. Don't you dare speak to him like that, you hear me? You don't know what you're talking about. You don't know the first thing about worship. Do you know? Do you have any idea how much I... Listen, you guys-- How much I wanted you? How much I loved you, you asshole? You know? And then, what an idiot I am, how pathetic is that? Me in love with you. And then Bobby comes along, and I fall in love with this one, and then I think that we... That the three of us, maybe we could... [SOBS] Fuck it. JONATHAN: Clare? Just leave me alone and go back to the house and have a drink. Clare! Clare... How could you? Just leave without saying anything? I couldn't be the uncle anymore. Give me a break, okay? Clare, hey... Don't call me that. What? Don't call you what? Your name? What did you think I would do without you, Jonathan? What were you thinking? BOBBY: Oh, Clare, come on. I'm pregnant, you fuckers! What? Are-- Are you sure? I'm completely sure. You wanted this. Didn't you? God help me. Clare... Oh, man. You think? Yes. Yes. [LAUGHING AND CRYING] [***] JONATHAN: What do you think about "Ethan" for a boy? Or "Trevor"? CLARE: Let's not get too fancy. If it's a girl, let's call her "Clare, Jr." One Clare per family is enough, thank you. What's the kid gonna call Bobby and me? Oh, I never thought of that. "Daddy," I suppose. Like, "Daddy One" and "Daddy Two?" * Oooooh-oooh-ooh * * Oooooh-oooh-ooh * * Oooooh-oooh-ooh * * Oooooh * CLARE: We're gonna have to move, aren't we? JONATHAN: Right. Funny family will need a third bedroom. Frankly, I think funny family may need a whole new neighborhood. JONATHAN: Somewhere where two out of three people passing by are not actively psychotic? Exactly. BOBBY: How about Cleveland? No! No! BOBBY: Let's move here. Please repeat what you just said. It's too hard to raise a kid in the city. Don't you think? But what if the kid turned out to be some sort of, I don't know, Heidi. I mean, how much goodness do we want? Growing up in the country doesn't doom anyone to good behavior. Most of the really interesting murderers come from derelict farms. This is so adult, looking at real estate. We are adults, sort of. JONATHAN: Who would the kid play with way out here? CLARE: Maybe woodland creatures, like Snow White did. I don't want him hanging around with squirrels. They have personality disorders. CLARE: Stop it! This one has a great soul. Don't you think? Baby? It's your money. It's my grandfather's money. I didn't earn a dime of it. Still... you'd be the owner. What do you think? You really want this, don't you? Um...if you do. If we all do. No, you, Bobby Morrow. Beautiful, crazy boy. You want this, and I could get it for you. No, it'd be for us. [DUSTY SPRINGFIELD'S "WISHIN' AND HOPIN'" PLAYING] So long, treasures. * Wishin' and hopin' And thinkin' and prayin' * * Plannin' and dreamin' Each night of his charms * * That won't get you Into his arms * * So if you're looking To find love you can share * * All you gotta do is hold him And kiss him and love him * * And show him that you care * * Show him that you care Just for him * [DOOR OPENS] I'm thinking white here. Totally white, like a Shinto shrine, and somewhere we can hang paper lanterns all over. You are the gayest living human being ever. Somebody's gotta be gay around here. What do you like, Bobby? I think I'm gonna go... and fix a window. Okay, Jonathan... blue is your friend. See, blue is the color of sky and water. Yeah, but white goes with everything. Yes, well, honey, it's a house, not an outfit. * So if you're thinkin' Of how great true love is * * All you gotta do is hold him And kiss him and squeeze him * * And love him * * Yeah, just do it And after you do * * You will be his * * You will be his * * You will be his * [BABY CRYING] It's all right. I'll do it. No, sleep. It's my night. It's okay. Bobby's doing it. It's his night. If we don't keep to the schedule, you know, then we'll all be exhausted by tomorrow. I don't care. I miss my daughter. BOBBY: Guess nobody's sleeping tonight. JONATHAN: Hello, Rebecca. Hello. Oh. Aw. Oh... Oh, sweetie... [COOING] Who's a girl? [HONKS] Hey, beauties and heroes. Where have you been? Come with me. I got something to show you. This town's crying out for a cool, little café. CLARE: This town's crying out for an outlet mall. [JONATHAN & CLARE LAUGH] What? It has possibilities. Where? Point out a possibility. Kitchen's basically okay. Just needs a good cleaning. Look, wood floors. Is that a termite? No-- Oh, uh, yeah, maybe. I think I got a name. "The Home Café." What do you think? Well, it'd be better for business than "The Squalor and Desperation Café," I suppose. And the goddess said, "Feed the people and send them out happy into the night." How's that mushroom lasagna holding up? Two more orders left. Save 'em for Martha and Gill. No problem. You got 'em, my dears. Thanks, Jonathan. [BABY CRYING] We're home, dear. Oh, she's not happy today. For a full hour. I have no idea. Oh, hey, honey. Aw. Just feeling shitty? I think she's getting sick. I gotta get dressed and get back to the restaurant. Yeah, and I have to, well, pick up some toys. You okay? Never better. [CARTOON VOICE] Come on. I seem to have ended up the mother and the wife, haven't I? That's not fair. No, that's not fair. And I can't help that. [DOOR OPENS] I thought you'd be out here. I'm sorry. You haven't done anything. I just want everybody to be happy. I know you do. It won't always be like this. We're, you know, still getting started. Bobby, what if I... just couldn't do this? It'll be okay. Trust me. You know, I think maybe I'm not...this unusual. I think maybe it's just my hair. [QUIETLY] I love your hair. Come here. Oh, Bobby. Oh, mamacita! Here you are. Oh, look what you've done. Our little place. Oh, it's beautiful. Oh, that's Ned and me. Where did you find this? Oh, it's lovely, all of it. Oh. I want to see the kitchen. Come on. ALICE: Oh, I love it! CLARE: So here it is. Yasgur's Farm. The holy ground itself. It's hard to believe all that went on here, isn't it? It just looks like... Mud puddle and a field of cow pies? I know. Come on in, you people! No. I have been in that water before-- Bobby, don't you dare put her in there! [SMALL SPLASH] [LAUGHS] Boys, give 'em a puddle to play in... ALICE: They're sweet together, aren't they? In their gooney way. I think you're very brave. You do? Yeah. When I was your age, you got married, and you had a family. Never occurred to you to do anything else. Well, you know, I wanted that. I wanted... just a more normal thing, when I was younger. Just wanted a husband and a baby and... I think maybe you're better off. Really. One minute you think you have everything you ever wanted, and the next you... find yourself in some suburban neighborhood somewhere... and it's fine. I mean, it's not not fine. It's just... The world just... starts to shrink around you somehow. Most women have absolutely no idea what they're getting into. No. I don't suppose anyone knows what they're getting into... till they're into it. [REBECCA LAUGHING] [DOOR OPENS] Whoops. For God's sake. Hey, what's up? A little privacy, please. You never wanted privacy before. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What's that? It's nothing. Come here. It's... [VOICE QUAVERING] one of those spots, I think. Nah, man. It's a bruise. Maybe. Absolutely. Will you... Will you do something for me? Sure. Don't tell them. I can't-- If I'm sick-- You're not sick. I-- Well, just promise me that, then, okay? If it's just a bruise-- It is a bruise. If I just bumped my hip, then there's no reason to mention it, okay? It is a bruise. Okay, there is no reason to talk about it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. [KNOCKING] Mom, is that--? Your father's ashes. I thought there'd be a right moment, and now suddenly if I don't give 'em to you right now, I'm gonna have to take them back to Phoenix with me. He wouldn't have wanted them scattered in Arizona. I thought maybe we could scatter them here. Here? Well, this is your home, isn't it? I guess. You know, I think it might be best just to be done with it. He was a... A modest man. He wouldn't have wanted an elaborate ceremony. Mom. And I can tell you this. This is no more him than a pair of his old shoes. Not yet. I'm... Not here, not now. I'm... I'm not ready. Well...whenever you are. We should go. Okay. I love you, honey. I love you too. BOBBY: I'll see you at the café. ALICE: Bye! [LAUGHING] Oh, no, did you get yourself dirty? Did you? You got yourself so dirty. I need powder. Did you get yourself dirty? I know you did. You're so sexy like this. And you are a true pervert. Get me the powder. Who's a girl? Who's a girl? What happened? You got something on your face. Here, let me. Hey. [GURGLES] [LAUGHS] You can do anything, can't you? Me? Nah. I mean it. You can live in the suburbs, in the East Village, you can live in the country, and it just doesn't make any difference to you, does it? I don't know. I never really think about it. There you go. All done. Come on. Thanks. Come here. Sit up there, princess. You are a strange and mysterious creature. I'm, like, the least mysterious one around here. I'll bet you could live in the Sahara. I bet you could just pitch a tent and find someone to sell you a camel. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I mean it. Is there anything you couldn't do? I couldn't be alone. No. No, you couldn't, could you? [BOBBY & JONATHAN HUMMING "LOOK OUT, CLEVELAND"] * Look out, Cleveland * * A storm is comin' through * * And it's comin' right up On you * [THE BAND'S "LOOK OUT, CLEVELAND" PLAYING] * Look out, Houston * * There'll be thunder On the hill * * Bye, bye, baby Don't you lie so still * * Was Wednesday evenin' When first we heard the word * * It did not come By train nor bird * * T'was when Ben Pike Stepped down to say * * "This old town's Gonna blow away" * * Look out, Cleveland * [OVER RADIO] * A storm is comin' through * [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Hey, man. * Look out, Houston * Blessings on our day off. * There'll be thunder On the hill... * I wonder if we should be closing on Mondays. I feel a little guilty about it. No worries, please. [MACK JAMES' "I SHALL BE RELEASED" PLAYING OVER RADIO] Hey, that little bruise gone away? Well, no. Let me see. It's the same. Let me see. * They say everything Can be replaced * * Yes, every distance Is not near * See? It's the same. No, man. It's fading. * So I remember every face * You really think so? Absolutely. * Of every man Who put me here * * I see my light come shining * * Come shining * Hey. You want to dance? What? Come on. * Any day now * * Any day now * * I shall be released * * Whoa, mmmm-hmm * * Whoa, oh * * Oh, oh, yeah * [BOBBY & JONATHAN LAUGHING] * Down here next to me * * In this lonely crowd * * Is a man who swears He's not to blame * * All day long, I hear him * * Cry so loud * * Calling out That he's been framed * * He's been framed * * I see my light * * I see my light * * Come shining * * Shining, oh, oh * * From the west Down to the east * * From the west Down to the east, yeah * * Any day now * * Any day now * * Any day now * * Oh * * I shall be * * I shall be * * I shall be released * * Oh * Jonathan? Mm. Hi. Ow. I was so in love with you. I was in love with you too. But Bobby is the love of your life. You know it's not that simple. It's just that... I seem to have ended up... Come to bed. I can't sleep. Do you want me to get up? No. Go back to sleep. Good night, crazy mama. It'll all seem better in the morning. Gonna miss you. Oh, it's just a few days. You're taking a lot of stuff. Well, she needs a lot of stuff. Okay, I think we're all set. So... Bobby... Uh-huh? Do you want to come with us? I can't. Bobby... Do you want to come with us? No. [SOFTLY] Okay. Okay. Call me. I will. Okay? Yeah. JONATHAN: You're a brave woman, visiting your mother all alone. Ugh. She's not alone. She's got Rebecca with her. Now... [KISSES REBECCA] Don't worry, Miss R. [REBECCA CRYING] The best thing about Philadelphia is you can leave it, and we'll be waiting for you right here when you come home. If you're lucky, and good, we'll have a special surprise waiting for you when you get back. Lovey. Lovey. Boys... Uh-huh? Be good. Always. Love you. [ENGINE STARTS] [***] * Oooh-oooh-ooooh * * Oooh-oooh * [KNOCKING AT DOOR] You sleeping, man? I can't, really. They're not coming back, you know. This is a good spot, don't you think? Yeah, I do. You think we should, like, say a few words? We got this far, Dad. I think you'd like it. I really do. Amen. I should've written something. No, man. This is perfect. Anyway, Dad, here we are. It's our place, and it's yours too. Okay. Now. One... two... three. YOUNG JONATHAN: What's that? YOUNG BOBBY: Windowpane. For clarity of vision. If something bad happens, tell my parents I tried to be good, but it was just too hard. You're not freaked out about the graveyard? I mean, don't be. The dead are just people too. People who wanted the same things we want. What do we want? I don't know, man. I mean, our lives, right? Man, like, this whole big, beautiful, noisy world, and everything that can happen. Uh-oh. All's well, little brother. Your folks love you. I love you. Nothing to fear. BOBBY: I've been thinking. We should repaint Rebecca's room. Like, pink. She'd like that. Don't you think? Okay. She'll come back someday... to this house, I mean. It'll be hers. I guess it will be. She probably won't want it, right? She probably won't have any idea what to do with it. But still, it'll be hers, you know? It'll be hers. Listen... this will be an all right place to put my ashes too, okay? Sure. I mean... whatever you want. You built us a very good home. That's not what-- That's what you did. That's what you did for me, you know? It's funny, isn't it? What? The big, beautiful, noisy world. Everything that can happen. Yeah. It's funny.
