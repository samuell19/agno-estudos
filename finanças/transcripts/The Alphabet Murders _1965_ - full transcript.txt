MGM presents... That's me. MGM presents me as... ...as Hercule Poirot, the Belgian sleuth. Au revoir. No, no, no, no. Don't try to sneak up on Poirot, my friend. It could be... dangerous. Now I know that normally wherever Poirot goes, there is intrigue, excitement... ...murder. But not here, not today, not in London. No, I'm here actually simply to see my tailor. Now, if you've been with me last week... ...in Istanbul... Well... There we are. I'm sorry. Again, au revoir. Please, do not follow Poirot. This is London. Nothing is going to happen. Goodbye. What, may I ask, is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of, eh... ...what, monsieur Poirot? This, this... That? It tegs. "Tugs"? Tugs, tugs, is it tugs? Aaa! "Aaa"... Aaa what? Cigarette? Yes... no. No, I don't want a cigarette. Put them away. Just as I thought, sir. We have given out smoking since our last fitting, have we not? We have, and we do not care to discuss it. Not I need is to upset the nerves, what is why I might say... ...we exchange the weed for the weight. And the bulge is no longer disguisable. - Belge? - "Bulge". I have no "bulge", I 've not changed my shape. Perhaps you would be so kind as to observe this jacket, the one you came in. Notice the crease. It, also, "tugs". I'm afraid we have only two alternatives. Either we resume smoking... or we diet. I shall do neither. Thank you, Cracknell. Here you are, sir. Snooping about just like you said he would be. You picked well for a discreet killing, my friend. Very professional. What do you have to say for yourself? Mmm? Come on, speak up! Doesn't seem to want to talk, sir. Your hand, Cracknell. Well, explain yourself. Parlez-vous français? Parli italiano? Sprichst Du deutsch? Hablas español? Ομιλείτε ελληνικά; Bamazaga pyaw daq lar? I'm neither French, Italian, German, Greek, Spanish or Burmese. I happen to be an Englishman. Then you have disgraced yourself. How so, pray? One does not expect an Englishman to be an assassin. Good heavens, I haven't come here to assassinate you. I've come here to protect you. Protect me, indeed, I've never heard such an extraordinary assassin. Can you support such a statement? Certainly. Would you care to see my credentials? As you see, I'm temporarily attached to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Be gone, Cracknell. ...Hastines. - "Hastings". Of course. Hestines. By the way, how is sir Edouard? - Sir Edward? - Your chief. Is that his name? I've always known him as 'X'. Really?... What is the interest of the British Secret Service in Poirot? Her Majesty's government seems to think that you're a very important person... ...and, as such, are entitled to protection. I understand you're not very popular with the criminal classes. No. It would be the most almighty top-level fuss, you know, if you were stabbed, shot or blown up, or did suffer any inconvenience while on British soil. Yes, yes, I suppose it would, actually. In that case... I suppose you must join me in a massage, my faithful bulldog. One never knows, does one? You know, I once found a black widow in my bed. Black widow in his bed? Whether why I should object to that, unless she wasn't very... Ah, Cracknell... Be ruthless, Cracknell, be merciless. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Too hard. Monsieur Poirot... ...There's going to be a murder. This is a secret establishment, you should be on the other side of the building. There's going to be murder. I'm frightened! That's why I'm here. I'm terribly frightened. Oh, you think someone is going to kill you, eh? No, I'm going to kill someone. No more massage, please. I can't help it, you see, I must kill. Hastines! Hastis! Don't call out, monsieur Poirot! Hastis! Hastis! Don't do that, monsieur Poirot, don't do that, you mustn't do that, you can't do that! - Hastis! - I killed this morning already a man. - His initials were A.A. - A.A., eh? I've killed before, I must kill again. Hatistes! I'm so sorry. - Don't do that, now listen to me! - Cracknell! Cracknell! - Oh, I am sorry, sir. - Cracknell! Help me! - How, sir? - I don't know this woman. Alright, young woman, on your way. Get out! After her! Come back. Come back. You assure, we wish to commerce with brandy-- Yes, yes! Yes. Monsieur. Ah! Extraordinary. And this is even more extraordinary. What is? That such a chic creature has nothing in her handbag. No mirror, no make-up, nothing. What is this? It's a scoring card from a bowling alley. How you can eat in a time like this? It is not for this you may believe me... ...It is for this. The little gray cells... AAA! ABC! Her initials. A. B. C. Good Lord. I also read the newspapers. Now I ask myself... Why should you wish to kill Poirot? You wanna be jolly careful from now on. Where you go, what you do... ...what you eat... She used poison on the dart, it says it there. - Well, then, you better taste it. - Oh, no! - I don't think there's but a chance... - It's your duty, you're here to protect me. - I don't normally eat pâté. - Taste! - I say, this is rather good. - This is a challenge to Poirot... Why should this woman have nothing in her handbag... except that. My little braincells tell me... obviously she wants me to go to the bawling. - The bawling? - Yes. - Now, why? - Ow, the "bowling". Maybe she's in love with me... It's happened before. Very well... I shall go! Now, care, for your own sake, why don't you cut back the Brussels. I shall go where I choose, when I choose, how I choose. In that case, it would be my painful duty to stay right behind you. Les oignons, monsieur. I shall prepare the seasoning. Thank you! Now, the vinegar... Just enough, eh? Yes. Now, the salt... Do you mind? Thank you. Right. Now, lemon... Very good. Now... the brandy... No, not enough. A good tâte. Bet you you can't do it again. - I need some bowling shoes, in a hurry, please. - What size? I'm afraid I don't know the size, I usually have my shoes made for me. If you don't mind getting to the back of the queue, sir, we'll see if we can knock you up a pair. Looking for someone to play with? I am looking for someone, actually, yes. - Well, this someone is Betty Barnard. - I'm very pleased to meet you, miss Barnard... ...but I'm expecting someone. It seems she stood you up, doesn't it? It would seem so, yes. - Maybe you can help me. - Rather depends of what you have in mind. I'll be off in a few minutes... Got a cigarette? Egyptian on the right, Virginian on the left. Solid gold!... Hercule from Danielle. - Who's Danielle? - The most beautiful woman in Europe, actually. Light? Of course. Won't you join me? - No, thank you, I've given them up. - Then why do you carry them with you? To strengthen my willpower. What good is willpower? - May I have my cigarette case, please? - How much is it worth? It is beyond price. - It's mine. - And this is mine! Me... You couldn't afford the down payment. C'mon, get your coat, you've got a date, remember. So I have. - I happen to be looking for a young lady. - So I noticed. Very tall... Very beautiful... Very blonde. Very strong... A little strange in a manner, you know? I don't know her name... But her initials are A B C. - You know her! - No. Now, why should you say that? - AAA, you can tell me about her. - You bet your life I c- Shut up! There's no point in asking her about women. All she knows about is men. - Especially the size of their wallets. - Alright... That's it Don Fortune! May I have my cigarette case, please? There's your case! My goodness, easy, young people certainly take their bowling seriously. Hey, Poirot, where are you going? Come back, Poirot! Hey, you! Bring back my shoes. Poirot! Come back. Hey, you! Fat boy! - Hey, you! - Let go of me, will you, let go of me. - Where do you think you're going? - I have to follow a man. Young lady! Young lady, I've been looking for you. I am Hercule Poirot, now surely you wanted me to find you. I don't know you, what do you want? Oh, come on, of course you remember wrestling with me in the steam room. I don't know what you're talking about. I've never seen you before-- Will you, please, turn this off? - You want some help, miss? - Yes, please... This man keeps bothering me. Please... ...Please, young lady... Please! - Please... - I think you better catch some other bus. - You mind your own business. - No mind his as long as you mind yours. That young lady is my business. She doesn't think so! - You mind your business! - You just clear off. - Someone get the police! - That's a good idea. Call the police. Call the police! Thank you. What's all this, then? Isn't a bit late for Christmas? Sorry, sir... Been a long night. You've noticed that too, have you? I want to borrow some boots. - Boots? - Boots! I suppose it wouldn't be in the national interest to inquire why-- No! No, sir. What size boots, sir? Well, I generally have-- Guess, well, we won't go into all that again... Just give me the largest boots you have. Dragbot! Take your boots off! No questions... Take off your boots. Now, then... I want to help in tracing a very important missing person. I better see your inspector in charge of C.I.D. I'm afraid you can't, sir. He's out on a case. Well, get him back! It's a case of murder, sir. Scotland Yard are involved. Yes, and we don't want little routine matters added to it. Did you say "murder"? These things do happen, sir. Thank you, Dragbot. - Boots. - Thank you. I suppose the victim wasn't a little short bald-headed Belgian... ...with a bit of a beak, was he? I hope they fit, sir. You don't mean... ...very short? Very bald, a little Belgian with a beak? This is what I just said! This way, sir. Well, the charge is using insulting behaviour towards a young woman... ...with intent to commit a breach of the peace. There's nothing to worry about... He claims he's doing his yogurt. P-Poirot, what are you doing there? Get up... Get down at once! - Open the door, come on! - Yes, sir. When I collected your clothes from the hotel, they asked me when you were leaving. I told them today. Then you eerd my derrasting... You eerd... Your... valuable, sir. - I'm sorry, sir-- - I do not wish to discuss it... ...or even to think about it. Look, why don't you go home, then I could go home, I've been up all night... ...my wife won't understand. There is a telephone, there is a telephone-- I'm not allowed to tell her that I'm in the secret service... ...she thinks I'm in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Beyond belief! Please tell me where you're going. I cannot see why they're having such difficulty. The whole thing is very clear, Mr. Stringer. I quite agree, miss Marple. The solution is A-B-C to anyone with half a braincell. If you must know, I have some unfinished business... ...with my little bawling instructors. Then, I shall have to come with you. I can't prevent you, but, at least, don't appear to be with me. If you must follow, must you follow so close? Listen. Follow! You mustn't be afraid It pays to be careful. Violent boyfriend. Is she dead? Dead. Any... any blad? - "Blood"? - Blood, blood! No... just a book. The initials of the blonde. ABC. Well, you've taken your time getting here. You can thank monsieur Poirot, for there's your murderer. This is inspector Japp of Scotland Yard. - I've talked to your ambassador-- - Oh, how is he? Oh, very well, sir. I'd like to apologize for this misunderstanding, sir... I thought the name was Pairot, of course, if I had realized it was Perot... Poirot. Never mind all that now. Did you telephone my wife? Oh, yes. She says she's looking forward to having you home again. - Inspector! - Oh, yes... Now, you said, this blonde young serves this nutcase... Actually, I said her manner was rather strange, did I not? Yes, yes... You say you've seen her on just those two occasions... Yes... Try that trouser pocket, man! He didn't happen to threaten you with an airgun, sir... Airgun? Yes, that's how she was killed, a poison dart in the neck... ...fired from a high velocity air pistol. Then don't you know it was not a blow gun... Congratulations. Now, you've seen this blonde only on these two occasions... To repeat myself, yes. - Thank you! - And you, sir? To repeat myself once, give me the key, I'll manage. You know, it's funny... She never tried this airgun luck on you, sir. I mean, likely seems her modus operandi... ...I mean, there was this water clown... ...and, now, this one, same fatal deaths. Yes... That man's name was... Albert Aachen... A.A. The initials of my strange blonde... A... B... C. Her first victim... A.A. Her second... B.B... Her third... C.C. He thinks she's going right through the alphabet, inspector. Yeah, alright, sergeant, carry on. How do you explain this calling card? A nutcase. Could it be that someone wants to make quite sure this girl, A.B.C., is blamed. No, no... You thought for yourself. She attacked you. You jumped to that conclusion! No, no, I didn't. You did. Oh, come on, we're splitting hairs. As the good inspector said... She could easily have used her... ergonomy twice... Why did she not? My little gray cells answer... Maybe...she did not want Poirot's life. Maybe what she wanted was... Poirot's help! Well, for all the help she may wants, she can get from us. - From you? - The police. In the meantime, I'd be glad if you and the captain... ...would accompany me to the police station and write out your statements. And, of course, any theories you many have-- Statements? There is not time... Afterwards, I'll be glad to provide you with a motorcycle escort... ...to London airport. Oh, that's very kind of him, isn't it? Thank you, inspector. Where is the bathroom? Why? - You'll better go with him, sir. - No, I'm... Oh, I see what you mean, yes. - Through there, sir. - Thank you. - I'll come. - As you wish. A thought for you to conjure with, inspector... Who is... C.C. Help! It came from the most beautiful head in Europe What? I used it to pick your lock. My wife. No, no. You've come here to make talk with me about Betty, haven't you? I'm in the position to ask questions, not you. Who is A.B.C.? I thought last night you knew about her... And I thought last night you knew about her. I tried to pick her up a few weeks ago... Betty was giving me the runaround, I wanted to make her jealous. I did. It's very important that you tell me about this girl. Her? - No. - Betty... No. A.B.C. She gave me the brush off. I don't know any more about her that the initials on her handbag. You'd want to talk to Dr. Doncaster, not me. Doncaster? Some head shrinker she's been going around with. You don't seem to like him very much. He's after Betty, too. But why don't you go and bother him. You're obviously potty, so he'll be fascinated. - I think we will meet again. - I hope so. Then I shall be able to break your neck one time. Excuse me, madam. Hi! You have a death wish, I see. Aah! Dr. Doncaster. Your secretary told me I'd find you here. - Did she indeed? - Yes. Speaking of a death wish... ...do the initials A.B.C. mean anything to you? - Should they? - Or the name Betty Barnard? Can't we have him arrested? Well, it seems we're acquainted. One of your patients, obviously. Not a patient exactly, no. No, although it is true, madam... ...I would like to discuss with Dr. Doncaster what I have on my mind. In Rotten Row? That depends on the good doctor, doesn't it? Yes, well, shall we say at my office in an hour. I don't think we should say anything of the sort, darling... ...because in an hour you'll be somewhere with me. Yes, of course. I'm afraid I shan't be free until six o'clock. Very well. Six, sharp. Where have I seen her before? Where have I see-- Monsieur Poirot! Monsieur Poirot! You were looking for me last night, weren't you? And I found you, you remember. Not exactly. I did tell you about AA, didn't I? Yes, you did. And now, you're going to tell me about BB? Mmm? Oh, please... Don't do that. Let's talk. B.B. is dead. Who killed her? - Do you want my balloons? - Yes. Then I'll have your funny hat. Alors! Now, let's gather around. I propose to assume... ...generally still somewhere in this area, here. Now, I propose to divide it into convenient sections... ...and a lot one car and two of you to each section. See? - Now... Jenkins? - Yes, sir Edward... ... I mean, sir 'X'. And, Robert, so, I think, you take this area here... I quite agree, sir, it's not in the best tradition of the service. I don't regard him as being lost, sir, I regard him as being temporarily mislaid. Thank you, sir. ...Now, Dunham and Evitson, that area, down there. Now, look here, inspector... The odd murder here and there is neither here nor there. 'X' tells me that if anything happens to Poirot... ...Her Majesty's government would have to apolog-- He's got to be found! Yeah, well, you look after your nutcase, captain, and I'll look after mine. Japp. Yes... yes... What? - He's been at it, again, sir. - Has he, where? Where? Hyde Park. Molesting a young woman, sir. - Oh, my goodness... - What, on a horse? - You mean she was on the horse? - Who was on the horse? Oh, he was. Well, that's something to be thankful. No, get me a car and two motorcycles. I thought you'd given up smoking. This is a celebration. Oh, really? What are you celebrating? I'm celebrating my first cigarette in 51 days. You must have one. Oh, that's awfuly nice of you. Oh, that's very nice of you. - We're friends, aye? - Of course! Good. I was so hoping you'd know that if you couldn't see it from the Majesty's government's POV... ...you would see it from mine. Well, I mean, I got really no interest in this matter except... ...just to get home. Explain things to my wife... ...get a shave... ...get these boots off. - And get some sleep. - Hmm, yes, of course. Well, I mean, you've got some sleep last night. A little in the cell, yes. All that yogi stuff... Upside down. You slept like a mad. Yes, I suppose I did. I say... These cigarettes are ripping. Where did you get them? I make them myself. You know... I've always wanted... to make my own cigarettes. Miss Sparks... Yes, doctor? I know I have another appointment tonight, but you needn't wait. - Goodnight. - I could work late again. Are you absolutely certain... I mean, I'm quite sure you do-- Quite, quite sure. Yes, doctor. Doctor...it is exactly six o'clock. Good evening. I suppose your business is blackmail. My business is justice. - I'm Poirot. - I am not interested in your name. Burning at what you're up... Poirot? Hercule Poirot... Please... - Won't you... - Doctor... Betty Barnard... ...is dead. Shock tactics, eh, monsieur Poirot? I'm sorry to dissapoint you... It was in the evening papers. You were an intimate friend of hers, of course? Of course. - No tears, doctor? - No tears, monsieur Poirot. She was an experiment. An experiment? A near perfect specimen of the primitive aggressive female acquisitive personality. In lay language, a gold digger. I see. Women and their mental processes are my work. - Interesting work. - I enjoy it. Who is A.B.C.? - ABC... - Blonde. Beautiful. Very tall. You're speaking of Amanda, of course. Amanda... Amanda who? Amanda Beatrice Cross. A-B-C... Tell me about her. I'm sorry, I never discuss my patients with anyone. Your patient, eh? - You're still treating her? - No, she went to Switzerland last month. Some idea that the mountain air would be beneficial. I haven't seen her since. And what if I tell you that your former patient... ...has said she's a murderess. I am not surprised. That she said it, or that she is? She is a certain type of schizophrenic, a split personality. Perhaps I can explain it in simple language. A paranoid schizophrenic. One half immature, one half influenced by a system of delusions. Probably, delusions of persecution. Consentanious with a sharply developing obsessional anxiety. - Quite. - One moment homicidal, the next... frightened and shy, actually. Indeed. Now, tell me, doctor... Is it possible for this obsession to take the form of a preoccupation with... ...the alphabet... A-B-C. Monsieur Poirot... For you I'm prepared to break the rule. Would you sit down? Listen. A... B... C... AA. B... B. BB. ABC. AA. BB. I injected her with the so-called truth drug... I use it sometimes to break down inhibitions. But is that all? Yes. She proved 90% pentothal resistant. What she said there was its only effect. But, at least, it crystallized her obsession. So, that people with initials A.A., B.B., C.C. and so on... ...would be the natural targets for a homicidal drive, eh? Obviously. Tell me, doctor... ...is it possible for such a person to be dominated? Dominated? Used as an instrument? Either for murder itself... or a cover for murder? It would make a... fascinating experiment. Thank you very much, doctor. We shall resume this consoltation at a future date. Amanda! Hide me...please hide me! Amanda, you must go out the way you came in. No. Please no. Go out the way you came in. I'll do anything... Anything...anything... If you don't mind my saying so, captain, your appearance is getting a little embarassing, even for the secret service. A wash and brush up wouldn't-- Yes...well... It's only a suggestion. For there he is, we must stop him! Push the button! Come back! - Drive... Drive! - I'm very sorry, sir. This is a police car, sir. Police? Taxi! Drive! Come back, Poirot! Sir Carmeekle Clarke. Well, that would be the famous ship owner. Carmeekle Clarke. C.C. - CC! - Yeah, and "way-way" to you, monsieur. Where are you going? 6 Darlington Square, and erry. - 6 Darlington Square, are you sure? - Yes, of co-- No. We must go to the Dorchester, I must change. Are you suggesting that this young woman is going about London killing people and that she now proposes to butcher me? Yes. - Simply because my initials are C.C.? - Yes! What you need, sir, is a sherry. - Thank you, sir. - I'm sorry, monsieur Poirot... ...what you are saying is sheer nonsense. The police, at least, don't think so. In fact, I imagine, they'll be at this home very shortly. - Why? - To protect you. Sir Carmeekle... Diane... May I remind you that we are expecting a guest for dinner? Oh, Judson... Some men may be calling shortly, they're police, send them away. You may stay for as long as it takes you to finish your sherry, monsieur Poirot. Lady Carmeekle, is-- - Allow me. - Thank you. You just heard our master's voice. Lady Carmeekle... - Is anything the matter? - Egyptian tobacco. - Do have one. - No! I mean, no, thank you. I've given them up. - Poor man. - Lady Carmeekle... I'm sure you can pursuade your husband to take this matter seriously. - Really? - Yes, of course! Monsieur Poirot... In certain moods, no one can persuade my husband of anything. Not even me, believe it or not. My step brother lives in a square world of his own, mr. Poirot. For instance, he still thinks I'm too young to drink. Most people are. I must say that he's taking this whole affair with remarkable coolness, and so are you. Seriously, old Clarke tires me monotonously right. For instance, if there's anything wrong with Amanda, she certainly won't do us any harm. As long as it takes you to drink your sherry. The master said. Strange family. Back door! Go away! I want a word with sir Carmichael Clarke. Sir Carmichael Clarke does not want a word with you! Right, captain, we'll return to the Square. If you'll be kind enough to observe the premises, I'll procure a search warrant. It's alright, Judson. Very good, madam. - Look, someone came up after you-- - Nevermind, I've missed you. Congratulations. Why are you still here? I was told I could finish my sherry? Well, I... never liked to see a man drinking alone... ...why don't we join him, Diane? Well... We are civilized, eh? Tell me, doctor, how did you get along with my friend, inspector Japp? Oh, a plain-closed case of retarded development, I should say. But almost interesting is the chap who was with him, a sort of tramp in a bowler hat. Oh, yes, they're inseperable. - I put it to them-- - Allow me. monsieur Poirot as I put it to you. Thank you. This girl is lost, distracted... - You've seen her? - No, no, no. But that's how I measure she must be by now. Anyhow, I feel that any shock... ...such as a clumsy attempt to arrest her... ...might well send her right over the edge into suicide. Poor Amanda. I offered my full cooperation to inspector Japp... ...but I might as well have been talking to a trained chimpanzee. Did you also offer your full cooperation in the case of Betty Barnard? I... explained about her, yes. May... may I have my lighter, thank you. Did you also explain that you and miss Barnard were friends? Actually, more than that? Duncan! Duncan? Doncaster? D.D.? - Congratulations, sir. - Car... Eavesdropping? My wife is never jealous of me... How very interesting... The cheater cheated? The deceiver deceived -- don't take any long time off your sherry. It's... it's such a large glass. Didn't think I knew about it, did you? Sneak out in the middle of the night, back before the old fool wakes. So clever. I presume you have some grants for these allegations, sir Carmichael? Grants? Certainly. The word of a gentleman, which you so obviously are not, sir. I happen to be passing, sir. - Ask mr. Franklin to come here, please. - So it was Franklin. - I'm afraid mr. Franklin is out, sir. - Out? Where? Well, he said he was going to the Bellfray, sir. - The Belfray? - A gaming club! Your precious step brother is practically bought the place. With your money. - I don't believe you. - Go, and see for yourself. - I shall be dining alone, Judson. - Very well, sir. And I shall require a taxi at 9 o'clock. Well, I suppose I won't finish my sherry. Will you excuse me? Madam... Doctor. Hold up! Hold on! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm so sorry. Please excuse me. Thank you. Sir Carmeekle. - Leave me alone. - Please, listen to me, sir. Stand up. I want to talk to you. Sir, believe me, your life is in danger. That man is running away! He did it! He did! There he goes! After him! I've got you! A.B.C., I've got you! Help! I've got the murderer! Help me! No, you fools! Don't you, at least, wish to know my thinking on this case? Every policeman in London is looking for A.B.C., yes? Well... She's not only remarkably beautiful and remarkably blonde, she is about 6 feet tall. Does not something strike you? But of course, why haven't you caught her? Precisely! Someone must be harbering her. "Harbering" her? Harbering her! Harboring her. That's right. I ask myself... où? My little gray cells reply: "Probably dr. Doncaster." Call him. Tell him A.B.C. has been spotted, and your men are closing in. Then, if I am right... He'll go to her! Exactly! Really, it's so simple, it's childish. And that's all it is, childish. What kind of a nutty is gonna harbor a nut who's already killed three times. Oh, so sorry. I trust you'll allow me to accept defeat with dignity. I don't relish this... ...this bum's rush. No, no, of course not. Alright, inspector. I'll take it from here. Come along. I must say, you're taking this extremely well. Just like an Englishman. - You flatter me. - Not at all, I mean it. - Thank you. - Not at all. Thank you! - Allow me. - Oh, thank you. Help! Help! I believe there's a man locked in there. You must find a key. To Town. This hairpin came from the head of the most difficult woman in England. My wife's. I think I'm beginning to think I've underestimated you. - Shall we return? - Too much trouble. Really? If I put you on a plane, you'll only come back on the next. Oh, yes. You're determined not to go home until you solve the case. Yes. Very well, then, I shall speed things up. I've decided to help you... Proceed, driver. What you're going to do? Well... ...I shall ring dr. Doncaster, impersonate inspector Japp-- - You? - Of course. It's easy. "Hello. Dr. Doncaster?" "This is inspector Japp." Well, you'll be very wise to tell him that. - This is dr. Doncaster. - Hello... "This is inspector Japp, here, sir." "I think we may be able to use your help after all, sir." "We've just spotted the young lady." - Spotted her? - "Spotted, sir." "We're hoping to pick her up at any moment." So, if you just hold yourself available, sir... Where did you find her? "Now, I'm afraid I can't tell you any more... Just at the moment." "Goodbye." - Well, what did you think of that? - Very good. I could have done that. You got to remember the number of the car. Yes. HMX13B. A! HMX13B. That's right, I forgot to tell you. It's a big white american car. In. Oh, I really don't think I should care for that. That's usually for the luggage. You wish to work with Poirot? In. No, what have you done? - What is it now? - We're working together, yes? - Well, where are we? - Shh! He went that way. Well, wait. My foot's stuck. My foot's stuck! Oh... Hello there. Would you mind coming over here? Could you come a little bit closer? I wonder if I might trespass on your kindness. I... I can't get out. It's my foot, you see, it's got caught somehow. Has your little foot got caught? - That's right. - Has it? Aaa, it's got caught. Well, I'll have to unlace your shoe. Hold on. Good evening. Good night! Oh, there you are, mr. "Perot." Yes. And not back home, in Brussels? Is he dead? Oh, yes, very much. Steady on. Steady. Here. Sit down. Thank you. Poisoned dart, I suppose, eh? Yeah, in the neck. And the usual, of course. The girl! She was here. She's not here now, but we will find her. But who hit Poirot? Let's have him in. Alright, you. He admits to clubbering you, sir. Does he? Oh, he made a complete statement. Did he? He thought Doncaster killed his girlfriend, Betty Barnard. Did he? - He was following the doctor... - Was he? - You were in the way... - I was. When he got to the cabin, Doncaster was dead and the girl gone. We're not holding him for the killing. We know who did that, don't we? Do we? But, no doubt, you want to press a charge ofr assault and battery. I will?... No, It's not-- It's not in the public interest. What isn't? For it to become known among the criminal classes... ...that Poirot can be hit over the head! Very well... See him off. Call yourself a copper! I am not a copper! Well now... The deceased appears to been harboring this young woman. Yes... Well, any... Thank you. Any, what you would call, clues, inspector? Clues appertain the mysteries, mr. Poirot. There is no mystery here. Mmm, lipstick. Egyptian cigarette. So, that's what the girl smokes. Yes. And so does lady Diane Clarke. Very interesting, I'm sure. Where is Hastines? Well, we might introduce ourselves. My name is Hastings. Captain Hastings. - Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. - Callie. Found Victoria 1992. How do you do? I must make a note of that. Hastis! Hastines? Hastines, it's Poirot. I'll get you out! What are you doing, if I may ask? My foot stuck in the lock, must have jammed. Oh, really? We found the girl, sir. My dear young la-- That's her. Stop her. Right. Here on you, get after her. No, no, please, please! If she sees someone coming, she will jump! She'll probably do that anyway. Hurry up, bring those nets! Oh, but if she really did come to me for help? Are you still on about that? Go on, get up there! If only I could talk to her. Now, look, mr."Perot", either they go up, or you go up. Hold my cane, please. You will hurry those nets, eh? Bring those nets! Amanda! Amanda! Please come down. If you come down, I can assist you. Amanda. Please. You asked for my help before. I want to help you, all I can. I know you're not to blame. It's not your fault. Amanda! I'm your friend. I know you're not responsible. It will be alright, I promise! Amanda... ...I want you to come down. Too late... It's too late. No, it's not too late... No!... No, Amanda! Please! Don't jump. Please don't jump! Let me try it. It's really excellent. You mustn't travel on an empty stomach, you know. Are you sure? Well, here goes. It's wonderful how they get this stuff upped, you know. It's nothing but a load of leftovers-- - There you are. - 'X'! Not in public, dear chap. "Sir Edward", please. How are you, Hercule? Teddy, Teddy, my old friend, good to see you, sit down. Thank you. I just thought I'd drop in and wish you bon voyage, Hercule. A pity the way things turned out... From your POV I mean. Well, of course it was an open-and-shut case all along. Curious you couldn't see that. I often feel you continental chaps are just a little bit too fanciful for your own good. Gallic temperament, I suppose. - Hey, Hastings. - Oh, hey, yes. Extraordinary mixed bag, wasn't it? I mean... a water clown, a bowling alley instructress, a ship owner and a psychiatrist. No rhyme or reason in it. Still, the poor thing was quite mad. Better off where she is, I suppose. Bottom of the river. Oh, well, that's life... What have we here? Kidneys? I should have thought red herrings are more in your line, eh, Hercule? Red herring. - Red herring, of course! - What? Kill four, to kill ONE. - Teddy, my old friend, I'm sorry. - Hercule, sit down. You still have your health, Hercule. The government wants to keep it that way. In one hour from now, my private plane will be taking you home, to Brussels. Teddy, Teddy, my dear old-- You are dealing with me, this time. - Not him. - Teddy... ...please, believe me. I say... Hadn't I better make the sauce for the jolly old "oignons"? - Teddy, Teddy, please. - Sauce, for the kidneys. Yes! Well, yes. By Jove, I believe I can help you there. Aah, the kidneys, yes! Now, first the sauce... ...lots and lots of sauce... The brandy. No, a bit more than that. Alright. Now, ready? Yes, indeed. Alright. We pour it in... Voilà! - Please, close the door at once. - Aah, the foreign gentleman. I wish to speak to mr. Franklin Clarke. I'm afraid mr. Franklin is out, sir. Very well, then... Lady Diane. I'm afraid she's also out, sir. Where are they? They are sure to be on the way to Scotland, sir. The 17:32 from King's Cross. Scotland? For the funeral, sir. Mr. Franklin and lady Diane... ...are taking my late employer aboard one of his ships at Greenock. The burial, you understand, is to be at sea. Afterwards, sir... Mr. Franklin and lady Diane are proceeding the same vessel on a sunshine cruise at the South Americas. To recover from what they described as "the strain of the past few days." Aa, I see. Come, get up. I say, must we go rushing around like this? I'm already feeling a bit queasy. Is it my imagination, or is it rather warm in here? Mr. Franklin turned up the central heating before leaving, and instructed that it remains as so, sir. - It is somewhat warm. - Good, then I'm alright. Turned up the central heating? Hastines, don't stand there like a monument. Where have you been? What have you been doing? Arranging a little extra insurance, my friend. Oh, really? Personally, I always feel perfectly safe with British Railways. Mind you, it's very different in France, isn't it? I wouldn't know. I'm not French, I'm Belgian. Well, it's the same thing. You both eat horse meat. Oh, no offense, old man. After all, it's you and I now, isn't it? Against the world! Come in. I think we deserve a little drink, don't you? Napoleon brandy. I've been keeping it for a special occasion. What shall we drink to? Our good fortune, don't you think? Mind you... I feel sorry, in a way. Oh? But I feel grateful to old Car for being so... rich. I'm grateful to you. Is anything the matter, Diane? I don't know. Suddenly, i feel dizzy. - Really? - Franklin, what's happening? Franklin, it's the drink! You've... It's quite alright, my darling... I just want you to sleep, for the moment. Can I help you, honey? I can manage. Good evening! Good evening... Control yourself, madam. I'm not stopping, madam. Thank you. - Poirot! - Of course. I think you owe me an explanation. Very well. I believe you're now considerably richer than you were, eh? If you're refering to my expectations on the death of my step brother, yes, I am! - But... - But? But, but? Well, she did had it, just as much as I do! Oh, yes, yes, I do know that, of course. We were just, em... coming in here to see if everything was alright... ...and then she passed out. Assisted by a few grains of barbiturate dissolved in brandy, eh? Napoleon brandy, actually... To resume! I agree that lady Diane... also has the motive. Motive? Motive for what? For killing four people to kill... one! And thus inherit a fortune. Aye... I'm afraid you're far ahead of me. I ask myself... Why should someone kill four times... ...and make it look like the work of a maniac? My little gray cells answer: "Because there was an obvious motive to kill just one of them!" So obvious, in fact, that even our friend, inspector Japp, would be onto it at once... Unless... ...there were enough red herrings. I've killed no one. Neither my step brother, nor anybody else. Oh, I know that. I know that you are no killer... You see, the real killer, killed just once too often. Don't you agree? You mean when I killed myself? It grieves me to admit it did not occur to me at the time... ...But, then, everything began to fall into place. What, if when you went to Switzerland, it was not for your health... ...but to contact... A.A. What if... he taught you his diving tricks... How to fall from a great height into the water and... survive. Yes? You are very clever, monsieur Poirot. And so now I wonder why you have deliberately involved Poirot in this? Oh, baffling the great monsieur Poirot adds a spice. I'm sure you'll understand... My vanity is as great as yours. "Vanity"? What do you mean, "vanity"? Allow me to hypothesize what will happen now... I will join lady Diane in that coffin... ...and together we will be buried at sea... ...in place of sir Carmeekle Clarke, whose body, even now... ...is being used to boost the central heating of his own house. - Exactly. - You, then... ...will take the place of lady Diane... ...and together with your "brave" chaperone... ...sail to the South Americas, with both halves of the fortune to come. Exactly! And now, monsieur Poirot... ...your death will be an advantage to me. But not, I'm afraid, to you. Naturally, I anticipated my little remarks would cause some small unpleasantness... But I do hope my insurance is still in effect. What are you doing? Stop it! Stop that, will you? I'm coming Poirot! Poirot! Hastines! Hold steady, old fellow! I'm on my way! I'm coming, we're in this together. Hold on! - Where are you? - I'll save you! I'm coming! Poirot! I'll save you! Poirot! Save me! Poirot! Help! Sir... Hastines, dear friend, you're taking this like a Belgian.
