April 1916. Driven to achieve an egalitarian, progressive and Gaelic Ireland, 15 hundred Irish rebels march to Dublin City, to mount a rebellion. # The Rebellion fails, but its ideals inspire the majority of Irish people to vote in the 1918 General Election, for the establishment of an Irish Republic. And after 700 hundred years, an end to British rule. I felt they had no right or reason here, we were a separate island, and we felt we owned it, and we wanted at some stage to get them out. But fresh from victory in World War 1 Britain rejects the People's Mandate, Ireland must remain in the United Kingdom and the Empire. Undaunted the Irish rise and stand against Britain's might and power. I don't consider it as action against Britain, as action for Ireland, and the liberation of Ireland. Armed with little more than faith and courage, the Irish declare a Republic, and vow to defend it, whatever that may bring. January 21st, 1919. The General Election has resulted in a landslide victory for the Sinn Fein party. Irish Nationalists have expressed a clear desire for independence. The successful Sinn Fein candidates, who are not in prison, gather at Dublin's Mansion House, where they proclaim an Irish Republic. They form an Independent Parliament, known as Dail Eireann, and call on the world to recognise the Irish Republic, free from British rule for the first time in centuries. There's a wonderful description of the first Dail by Maire Comerford. It's about how incredible it felt to be walking into the Mansion House, and to be actually there, and to have done it. There's the feeling that they're getting control of their own destinies. Trying to think out how they're going to make a new country. I think, for those who were there, it was a turning point, an inspirational moment, but we, perhaps, need to take a hard, cold look at this and say, well really the power that they wielded was very limited, and the power still wrested with the British Government at Westminster. The British rejected independence at that particular stage, they just reject. What do you mean you're independent? You're part of the United Kingdom, you're part of the Empire. Despite Britain's response, many in Dail Eireann remain hopeful that Britain can be persuaded, through peaceful negotiation to grant Irish Independence. But in the Military Wing of the Republican Movement, others have a different view. They believe that Britain will only leave Ireland if it is forced out by the barrel of a gun. "War must be faced, blood must be shed, not gleefully, but as a terrible necessity. Freedom must be had, at any cost of suffering." Among the most militant in the Irish Republican Army, some will become household names. Ernie O'Malley. Dan Breen and Tom Barry. With the circumstances of guerrilla warfare and people struggling for freedom, your first duty is to keep alive, and keep your men alive. Your second duty is to look after the people who are supporting you, and who you are trying to raise from a status of serfdom. But the IRA needs to become a far greater force, than the few whose names are remembered. Over 100,000 volunteers, from all over Ireland, will enlist in its ranks to support the cause. It is literally a peoples' army. It's of the people, it's of the community, it's of every parish in the country, literally. You're talking about well educated, literate young men in their mid to late 20s. They are lower, middle class, Catholics primarily, but not exclusively. They are the sons of small farmers. They are skilled tradesmen. They are people who have a lot to gain if there is change in the country. The IRA will be aided by the women's republican organisation Cumann na mBan. The solidarity was something extraordinary. You had a completely new idea of life, it was what you could do for Ireland, and nothing else mattered. The one priority was to get our freedom. Upwards of 20,000 women will enlist in 800 Cumann na mBan branches nationwide. We don't pretend to be one voice, we're one people with many voices, but we all wanted freedom. January 21st, 1919, the same day Dail Eireann meets in Dublin, the Republican Military wing launches an unexpected attack. If we were to wait to get orders from Dublin, nothing would ever happen. You just can't be waiting 'til someone 100 or 200 miles away tells you to do something. You seize the opportunity and do it. In Soloheadbeg, Co. Tipperary 2 Royal Irish Constabulary officers, escorting explosives are ambushed by a local IRA unit, acting on their own initiative. (Gunshots) The RIC men are shot dead. Mayoman, James McDonnell leaves 7 orphan children behind. The killing of the Irish Police officers at Soloheadbeg is condemned by many leading Republicans, and by the Catholic Church. Cumann na mBan and the IRA may be ready to fight against British Rule, but, as yet, few in Ireland want war visited upon their shores. Many Irish families had had sons and husbands and brothers who had died in World War 1. People were exhausted, they didn't want any more war. For now, the IRA holds fire, leaving Republicans who advocate non violence in control. They include former maths teacher, veteran of the 1916 Rebellion and Sinn Fein President, Eamon de Valera. On April 1st, 1919, after a daring prison break, and despite now being a wanted man, de Valera arrives at the Mansion House to tumultuous applause, as Dail Eireann sits for the second time. The room was packed to see de Valera elected first President of the Irish Republic. Dublin born Cathal Brugha, veteran of the 1916 Rebellion, is elected Minister for Defense. A 28 year old from Co. Cork, Michael Collins, also a 1916 veteran, becomes Minister for Finance. Collins immediately launches the Dail Bond scheme. In the months that follow, people across Ireland open their wallets, to support their illegal Republic. 370,000 raised, a huge figure, to finance the counter state, but also in raising public consciousness of the new Dail. Dail Eireann is intent on finding a peaceful path to Irish Independence. The appeal, in those days, wasn't fighting with England, or that. The project being put to the general public was that there would be an appeal to the Peace Conference, that we stood some chance, of getting something from the Peace Conference. With the First World War over, victorious allied powers meet in France, at the Paris Peace Conference, to carve the territories of the vanquished between them. American President Woodrow Wilson has become a strong advocate for the self determination of small nations. If President Wilson could be persuaded to support Irish Independence at the Paris Peace Conference, they could win freedom. A Dail Eireann delegation, led by future Irish President, Sean T. O'Ceallaigh, travels to Paris to petition for recognition of the Irish Republic. Eamon de Valera, meanwhile, travels to America, where he hopes to persuade the Irish Diaspora, to pressurise President Wilson, to support Ireland's cause. The welcome de Valera received in America was unprecedented and absolutely off the scale. In Fenway Park in Boston, 60,000 people turned out to see him. A couple of weeks later, in Wrigley Field in Chicago, he couldn't speak for 34 minutes, because the crowd were cheering and applauding. San Francisco, Butte Montana, Cleveland, every city he went to, it was the same. You have to go back to the 19th century to see the roots of that connection. It's basically the Famine, and it's devastating. A million people die, a million people flee the country. Thousands end up on the east coast of America, and these Irish, some leave with the view that in Ireland's extreme hour of need, that the British Government had failed the people. And hence, you have this memory bank, which builds up in the United States, amongst Irish Americans and they want to see their homeland free of this oppression. The welcome de Valera receives in America, encourages Irish Republicans. In Paris, new nations are being created at the Peace Conference. Perhaps Ireland can succeed as well. The Versailles Moment is, in many ways, one of huge hope and utopianism. There is a sense that this will remake the world, this will create a new fair and more just world global system, and there will be much more self determination allowed to individual nations. Now, that doesn't come to fruition. From Britain's point of view, Ireland was probably a bloody pain in the neck, they had bigger problems, they had bigger fish to fry. They had to think about the empire. The Irish are not the only people in the British Empire agitating for freedom They have so many hot spots to worry about. Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and Ireland. Despite pressure from Irish America, Woodrow Wilson is convinced by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, to ignore Ireland's plea, and another door closes on Ireland's peaceful quest for freedom. When that fails, they really don't have a follow up plan. And so it's that continued failure to achieve self-determination through peaceful means, that sets up an alternative, which is you achieve it through using a gun. Having held fire for 4 months, in May 1919, the IRA strikes again. Two Royal Irish Constabulary officers are shot dead as they escort a Republican prisoner at a railway station in County Limerick. As the face of British law and order in Ireland, the 12,000 strong RIC Force becomes a prime target for Republicans. The Royal Irish Constabulary, was the police force in Ireland. It was the most visual presence and it was the eyes and ears of the British Government in Ireland. "The police kept a file that time on practically any movement. Even joining the Gaelic League, the police kept a file of. Their movements were watched and they were shadowed". "They knew what you had for your breakfast, dinner and supper, if you had it. They knew even what you were thinking." On June 23rd, three weeks after the Knocklong killings, Michael Hunt, a RIC district inspector, was shot dead by the IRA in Thurles, County Tipperary. By the year's end, nine more RIC officers will have been killed. Again the killings are widely condemned. Fearing that the Irish public would be opposed to an all out military campaign against the Crown forces, Dail Eireann calls instead for a boycott of the RIC and their families. Their children were shunned at school. Their wives were shunned. They were completely ostracised. They couldn't even buy goods in the local shop. The wives and the children of the RIC in particular, seem to have suffered psychologically. The strategy is, make the RIC into pariahs. Make their ability to function as a police force, impossible. As the boycott takes effect, IRA headquarters are established in Dublin, in the early summer of 1919, under the command of chief of staff, Richard Mulcahy. The IRA must be prepared for any military conflict to come. I don't think people like Michael Collins or Richard Mulcahy thing there's any question that the British can be forced to leave Ireland. I think they think they can make British occupation very, very painful. And they can deplete their willingness to stay. Newly appointed as IRA Head of Intelligence, Michael Collins establishes an IRA spy unit. It becomes known as The Squad. They're hit men. These are young men whose only function is to kill people, whom Collins wants killed. Collins used to come down maybe twice a week. He'd come in and two hands stuck in his trouser pockets and he are ye goin' on lads. Oh not bad, Michael. Well, God be with yis now. Go on with the good work. The Squad's headquarters on Dublin's Abbey Street, is disguised as Moreland's Cabinetmakers, Upholsters and Builders. This was a most unusual builders because they never did any work. They had one of the squad standing behind the counter, dealing with any potential customers who would come in. It was always 'sorry, we're absolutely full'. Behind the wall, The Squad were there. They had their guns ready. And then, when the order came, out they went. The Squad's first target is G Division. The intelligence unit of Britain's Police Force in Dublin. Among them, Detective Sergeant Patrick Smith from County Longford, is suspected by Republicans as having identified leaders of the 1916 Rebellion, leading to their executions. On July 30th, just yards from his North Dublin home, a squad team shoots Smith in the back. (gunshots) His children run to help but he dies days later. September 12th. The squad assassinates another G Division detective, Daniel Hoey, outside a police station in Dublin City Centre. These killings of senior detectives anger those loyal to the British Crown. Immediate action is demanded. As pressure mounts, Lloyd George decides to act. On September 12th, 1919, the IRA, Cumann na mBan, Sinn Fein and Dail Eireann, are all outlawed. Irish nationalism's democratically elected representatives are forced underground. The suppression of the Dail is the turning point. This is the crossing of the Rubicon. If you suppress the Dail, you're removing the only legitimate vehicle that nationalism has for expressing its voice peacefully. There's no way back after that. With all non-violent paths to independence closed, in late 1919, the IRA leadership makes the decision to go to war. Their strategy is to undermine British rule by making Ireland ungovernable. In December 1919, the IRA launches an assassination attempt on Lord French, Britain's Lord Lieutenant in Ireland, as his convoy drives through the Phoenix Park. It's symbolic. He is the representative of the British government, of the king in Ireland. To carry out a successful assassination attempt on him would make headlines around the world. (gunfire) In the ambush, the IRA attack the wrong car. Though Lord French escapes, the attempt sparks panic in London. When the attempt is made on the life of Lord French, this is something that rocks the British establishment to its core. Members are sitting around the cabinet table, not knowing if they're safe. It's a sign that the IRA campaign has moved up a notch. The IRA continues to exert pressure. January 3rd, 1920. IRA Cork Number 1 brigade approaches Carrigtwohill RIC Barracks in County Cork. The attack force numbered about 20 men. The attack opened about 11pm, with volleys of rifle and gunfire. The RIC responded vigorously. After an hour's fighting, the RIC surrender. The rebels pull out with a haul of guns, bombs and ammunition. That same night, 16 IRA men attack Kilmurray RIC Barracks, west of Cork City. The RIC easily repel the attackers and the IRA men flee into the night. With the odds stacked against them, the IRA resorts to guerrilla war. Move quickly, be aggressive, be careful and then disperse. Don't stick around. Don't fight it out. Live to fight another day. Because of that, they're very hard to catch. "The Irish Republican Army had one outstanding quality. That of suitability to its purpose. It was indeed, the spearpoint of an uprising of a people". They arm themselves, they finance themselves, they elect their own officers. They are not really getting anything other than words of encouragement now and then from their general headquarters. The idea that Ireland should be liberated from colonisation, from occupation, is something that is shared by the many. But it is only the few who take up arms. Nominally, the IRA has 100,000 volunteers in its ranks. But weapons shortages mean fewer than 3,000 actually engage in armed conflict. Those not fighting support in other ways. They were doing intelligence work. They were following people. They were opening letters. They were cutting wires. They were digging trenches. They were blocking bridges, cutting down trees. They were doing all sorts of support work, basically to make Ireland ungovernable. Cumann na mBan women also provide vital support. "Out activities included carrying dispatches, arms and intelligence work. We visited the IRA prisoners and supplied them with such comforts as warm clothing, tobacco and papers". IRA attacks occur throughout the country. The heaviest concentration is in Munster. Particularly County Cork. Where IRA volunteers are frustrated for having failed to rise in the rebellion of 1916. It was right across the board in terms of rank and file. The sense of frustration. The sense of shame, that they had failed. There was a steely determination not to let that happen again. March 1920. Eight RIC officers are killed in IRA attacks. Across Ireland, the RIC become increasingly concerned for their lives and safety. When these attacks quicken and when individual constables are being killed, a whole portion of the force want to have nothing to do with it. So resignations go through the roof. About a third of the force resign. The government sees a lot of its posts as extremely vulnerable. And so they withdraw from hundreds of barracks across the country, just in about 3 or 4 months. By the end of 1920, 700 barracks are evacuated, as the RIC retreats to the relative safety of large towns. And that leads us to a situation where the British state is no longer as visible or as powerful or as able to assert its control and authority in Ireland, on a daily basis. Though Britain has tens of thousands of soldiers stationed in the country, it is reluctant to be seen as officially going to war in Ireland. Instead, war secretary Winston Churchill develops an alternative plan. "Decided to meet force with force, terror with terror." Churchill recruits World War I veterans into a new armed auxiliary police force known as the Black and Tans. Their orders are to support the RIC and reassert British control in Ireland. They're told take them out, kill as many as you have to, torture as many as you have to. You are released from the normal rules of war because you are not fighting the normal rules of war and this is entirely their responsibility. I joined it because there were no jobs about and things were pretty rough. I went up to Whitehall for an interview and I went to Ireland the same night. They'd seen the horrors of World War I and within a year they were being dispatched to Ireland to fight a guerrilla war. You can't imagine something so different. The IRA used to dig trenches in the road around the corners. You'd come across this and down would go your front wheels. Wallop. Straight in. That's when they used to throw one or two homemade bombs. In the bombs there was gelignite but pieces of iron and scrap metal. And all you could do is say here, share that amongst you. Human beings are going to stand so much and you're going to retaliate, aren't you? If your life is at stake, the other fella's going before you. They're incredibly badly led and disciplined. And a context of fear causes ordinary men to behave in really abhorrent and repugnant ways. They become extremely violent. The IRA men are all hiding. You can't find the men, so who do you attack? You attack the family home. In the course of the war, thousands of homes and properties throughout Ireland are attacked. We were ruthless to the marked degree of going to the limit of law and order. We'll put it that way. The pattern is usually that a Crossley Tender would arrive in the middle of the night with maybe 12 to 20 Black and Tans on board. (BANGING/SMASHING) They would kick the door in, stick a bayonet up against you and then they'd search the house. The search was really quite brutal. The children would be crying, terrified and sometimes the women were dragged outside and had their hair cut off with razor blades. We see several cases of women who reported being raped, where the women's names and their full addresses were reported to add veracity to these stories, that this was actually really happening. Local elections in early 1920 confirmed the strong support of Irish nationalists for the republican cause. Sinn Fein wins control of many local councils. In Cork, IRA leader Tomas MacCurtain is elected as the city's Lord Mayor. MacCurtain's term as Mayor will prove short lived. March 19th, 1920. RIC officer Joseph Murtagh is returning home from the theatre in Cork city when he is shot dead by the IRA. (GUNSHOT) Hours later, RIC officers, their faces blackened in disguise break into MacCurtain's home in Cork and shoot him dead in front of his wife and son. The killing of MacCurtain, a democratically elected public representative sparks outrage. 100,000 people line the streets of Cork for his funeral. What the republicans were very good at was propaganda. The propaganda value of funerals. Newsreels and correspondence from around the world come and cover his funeral. What Irish civil society is showing is that they have no appetite for British assassinations of republican officials, even republican officials who are involved in the IRA. Days later, the writer and IRA leader Terence MacSwiney stands in City Hall as Cork's new Lord Mayor. He's not a stereotypical Irish gunman. He has a young family. He has beautiful wife, a baby. He's pretty much the best front man the republicans can put forward. "One day the consciousness of the country will be electrified by a great deed or a great sacrifice and the multitude will break from lethargy and march with a shout for freedom in a true, brave and a beautiful sense." Easter Sunday, April 4th 1920. Two weeks after MacCurtain's death, IRA men march out across the land. Within hours, they have set 400 of the evacuated RIC barracks on fire. The flames confirm Britain's weakened authority over Ireland. The next day, Easter Monday, fourth anniversary of the 1916 Rebellion, 50 republicans go on hunger strike in Dublin's Mountjoy Prison demanding immediate release. When prison authorities refuse to negotiate, hundreds of Cumann na mBan women descend on the prison to support the hunger strikers. One of the most iconic photographs was that photograph of women on their knees praying outside of Mountjoy Gaol in that period in 1920. They use the power of prayer to make mass civil acts of disobedience. From the point of view of the government in keeping public order, it's easier to deal with a crowd of restless men than it is to deal with a crowd of restless women. You cannot really break up a demonstration of people who have come together ostensibly simply to pray. It's religion as a weapon. The Rosary as a weapon. The women are not alone. The Irish Labour Trade Union Congress decides to call a national strike to force the British hand to release the hunger strikers. Across Ireland, hundreds of thousands join the national strike. It was energy workers, water workers, road workers. Basically the country couldn't operate without all these people. Lord French argues that the British government must ignore the prisoners' demands. The prisoners should be left to die. But Britain is nervous, fearing a social revolution like that led by Vladimir Lenin in Russia. For the British government, this is a scary moment. They don't know what's going to happen next. After just two weeks, the government caves. The prisoners are released from Mountjoy Prison. People within the British administration in Dublin Castle, in the police, in the military, are horrified. What is going to be the deterrent if you can go into prison and you can just not take food and you can be cut loose. Emboldened by their success, nationalists boycott the Crown courts and Dail Eireann establishes its own alternative court system. Nationalists take control of most administration in Ireland. People stop paying government taxes, giving their money instead to republican funds. Railway workers embark on a six month strike causing major disruption to British military operations. A body of soldiers got on the train. Crews walked off. I suppose it was their attempt at patriotism. There's a Gandhian quality to this. We exist as a distinct people and ultimately there is nothing you can do to stop us from being the Irish nation. Only in Ireland's northern province of Ulster, does British authority continue virtually unchallenged. Here unionists, loyal to the United Kingdom, want nothing to do with Irish independence. Unionist politicians Edward Carson and James Craig have some degree of influence with Prime Minister Lloyd George. They urge him to find a political solution to the Irish question. The British Cabinet resolves to establish two Home Rule parliaments in Ireland. One for the North, one for the South. The partition of Ireland is underway. Summer 1920. With IRA attacks increasing, British authorities move to reassert control over southern Ireland. Lloyd George and his government realise by the middle of 1920, that large parts of the island have gone over to the enemy, are being controlled by the enemy; we must strike back. Somebody Churchill knew as a hard man, General Hugh Tudor, is sent to Ireland. "This country is ruled by gunmen. They must be put down." Tudor unleashes a new parliamentary group of elite British officers to support the Black and Tans and the RIC. They are known as the Auxiliaries. "Police and military will patrol the country roads at least fives times a week. When civilians are seen approaching, shout 'Hands up'. Should the order be not obeyed, shoot with effect." "The Auxiliaries were dangerous because they were really courageous. There were absolutely no cowards in them and they didn't care what they did." They regard Ireland as England's Wild West and they're the new sheriffs in town. Crown forces resort to collective punishment against local communities to discourage support for the IRA. During 1920, they destroy 48 farm creameries throughout the country. That collective punishment though, that's pretty much the last thing you want to do. The one only thing that does is create a lot of animosity. It doesn't normalise conditions. It makes them worse. It destabilises things even more. September 20th 1920. An IRA unit enters a pub on Drogheda Street in Balbriggan north of Dublin, where RIC inspector Peter Burke is drinking with friends. The IRA opens fire killing Burke. His death sparks an immediate reprisal. 140 Black and Tans and Auxiliaries descend on Balbriggan intent on revenge. The town will be destroyed. "To realise the full horrors of that night, one has to think of bands of men inflamed with drink, raging about the streets, firing rifles wildly, burning houses here and there. Loudly threatening to come again tonight and complete their work." By Morning, Balbriggan lies in ruins. Two local Republicans, Seamus Lawless and Sean Gibbons, have been bayoneted to death. Churchill basically says, 'It's regrettable but we have no alternative ' 'but to meet fire with fire in this way'. Over coming months, in response to IRA killings and ambushes, Crowned forces continue to conduct reprisals against civilians. Hundred of towns are looted and burnt. The policy of 'Reprisals' hardened and toughened public opinion against the British occupation. It made them see that these are not our well meaning rulers, these are our occupiers, these are our enemies. Though Britain is resolved to suppress the Irish Republican challenge to the bitter end, one man is about to make a sacrifice so great, that it will cause people throughout the world to condemn British mis-rule in Ireland. August 9th 1920. In a further attempt to control Ireland, the British Government enacts the 'Restoration of order in Ireland', act. The act grants Crowned Forces special powers to arrest Irish Republicans. Hundred of IRA volunteers are rounded up. Those who slip the net are forced to go on the run. And what eventually what ends up happening, is they start to gather in groups of 10, 30 or 40. And these become the nexus points of what will ultimately be 'The Flying Columns'. The members of The Flying Columns are the most zealous of The Republicans. The number of ambushes doesn't dramatically increase, however, the casualties inflicted increases significantly. The Flying Columns rely on the people to hide and feed them as they live rough in ditches, hills and mountains across the land. Now, partly as a result of British counter measures, British repression, there's a feeling that there's us against them. 'We will support them, we will protect them, we will disguise them and put them up and so on'. So, they had the support of the community, they were able to disappear back into the community and re-emerge from it and of course, that's what frustrated the British so much, the fact that they couldn't 'get them'. On August 12th 1920, Cork Lord Mayor, Terrance MacSwiney is arrested, charged with sedition, he is sentenced to 2 years hard labour in Cork jail. In prison, MacSwiney joins 11 other Republican prisoners on hunger strike. In an effort to break his resolve, the authorities transfer MacSwiney to London's Brixton Prison. Here, McSweeney continues his refusal to eat. As an elected mayor and member of Dail Eireann, MacSwiney's action captures global attention. So the press from all over the world, came to London, and they watched day by day, and every morning they would send out a bulletin. 'The Lord Mayor's condition today'. He's talked up as a sort of Christ like figure, sacrificing himself for the good of the people. Sacrificing himself for Ireland, just as Christ sacrificed himself for the salvation of the world. Appeals for his release are made by international governments and by Pope Benedict the XV, in Rome. But the British Government remembers its humiliation by IRA hunger strikers in April, and refuses to yield. The release of The Lord Mayor would have disastrous results in Ireland. And would probably lead to the mutiny of both military and police in the south of Ireland. As McSweeney endures his hunger strike, on August 22nd, a unit of the Cork IRA travels north. In Lisburn, they assassinate District Inspector Oswald Swanzy, in revenge for suspected involvement in the murder of Thomas Mac Curtain. Hours later, local loyalists retaliate by attacking Catholic homes and businesses in the town. Communal violence across much of Lisburn. 300 Catholic houses are burned and most of the Catholic population is expelled. But it then actually spreads to other towns. In Belfast, Catholic workers are attacked by Loyalists in the city's ship yards. The Catholics flee. They were running but there wasn't actually anyone in chase. Whatever had happened in the shipyard, they were so terrified they started to run and they just kept on running. Belfast IRA units retaliate, sparking the worse violence of the war in Ulster. After 3 weeks of fighting, 7,000 Catholics have been expelled from their jobs, 22 people are dead, hundreds wounded. By Winter 1920, Ireland has been flooded with British military re-enforcements, making it even more difficult for the IRA to operate. With Dublin City under curfew, resentment grows on both sides. Shopkeepers boycott Crown forces, raids on private homes and businesses take place almost every day. With 9,000 troops in Dublin, British military cordon off entire city blocks to conduct room by room searches. Innocent civilians are shot dead. It's a surreal world. You've got ordinary men and women and children, going about their lives. But erupting into that world, is this other world of a grenade being thrown, of a shooting, of a squad assassination. You'd raids, arrests, you had counter assassinations by auxiliaries. This is taking place in a city that officially is still part of the United Kingdom! In constant fear of arrest, Dail Eireann meets in secret rooms and basements. It wasn't a normal parliament by any stretch of the imagination. There was at times an element of 'Scarlet Pimpernel' about the activities of the Dail government. W.T. Cosgrave, was on one occasion, about to leave his office on Wicklow Street in Dublin, and he checked in the mirror, to make sure that his disguise was impenetrable and his staff approved his appearance. "Nobody will recognise you, Minister." And out he went into the street, and was accosted by a beggar who said, 'Spare a copper, Mr. Cosgrave'. There was a conspiracy to protect these underground ministers because they were seen as the leaders in our fight against the British. And by now, the demarcation lines were clear, it is Irish against British. With 55,000 troops and 15,000 armed police on the ground, by October 1920, Crown forces feel that they have finally regained control of Ireland. Lloyd George announces that he has 'Murder by the throat'. But Lloyd George has failed to take account of how Terrance MacSwiney hunger strike has captured the world's attention. There were demonstrations around the world, Barcelona, South America, all across The States. When you see the protesters outside the White House in Washington D.C., that's when we begin to see Lloyd George really worrying about how the perception of Ireland is undermining his legitimacy on a global stage. Even the Stevedores in New York Harbour wouldn't empty British cargo ships. So the King asked the Priminister, 'Could he not put an end to this?' And the Priminister said, 'No'. What MacSwiney does, he manages to encapsulate the drama,... and it's one in which the Irish are positioned as heroically suffering and enduring for something that's right, over might. Each day, friends and family stand in solidarity with MacSwiney's wife, Muriel, at Brixton prison. Terrance asked me to remain friends with his wife and I was trying to re-assure him that, we would look after her. At this time, the weight of the bed clothes was too much, to lift his finger was agony. On October 25th, having survived 74 days without food, Terrance MacSwiney dies. His death elicits a global outcry. It is one of the great propaganda coups of the history of any nationalist movement, I think. The international interest that follows MacSwiney is absolutely extraordinary. His name is known all over the world. MacSwiney body is met by huge crowds and is returned home to Cork City. Tens of thousands march behind the coffin, with acting President, Arthur Griffith at the head. MacSwiney becomes this story which other oppressed people identify as a heroic moment of resistance to Empire. MacSwiney's heroism, fortitude in the face of inevitable death, it instils a spirit of resistance into a lot of people who would have previously said, 'Well I'm against British Government in Ireland but what can be done?' A sufficient number of young people would have gone so far as to say, 'Well, I'm not going to do it myself but I'm going to have more understanding' 'and help as far as I can, those who are prepared to do it.' In the months that come, the war escalates as British Crown Forces try to excerpt their power over the Irish people. Britain has the IRA on the run. In America, while having raised millions for 'The Struggle', De Valera has failed to gain recognition for the Irish Republic. But MacSwiney's death had changed something, the majority of Irish people are now resolved to stand for freedom and face the inevitable consequences of war. 'It is not those who can inflict, but those who can suffer the most' 'who will conquer.' # Maidin moch do ghabhas amach. # Ar bhruach Locha Léin. # An Samhradh 'teacht san chraobh len' ais. # Is ionrach te ón ngréin. # Ar thaisteal dom trí bhailte poirt. # Is bánta míne réidhe. # Cé a gheobhainn le m'ais ach an chúileann deas # Le fáinne geal an lae.
