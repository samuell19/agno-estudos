Higher Universe Pictures. - Honestly, Francois. You chose the diviest dive bar you could find? This place smells like an asshole. - Blanche, the staff love it. It's great for morale. - So anyway, he rolls over and looks at me and says, "Blanche, tell me how you feel about me." And I'm like, "The same way I feel about itchy sweaters. "Now get the fuck outta my bed "and don't touch anything on your way out." Blanche, you're so funny! - Don't touch me. - So that's a common misconception. The majority of the organism is actually underground. The mushrooms are the fruit, or the dick, if you will. - You know, it's hard to find a bar that'll just pour you a full glass of Bailey's.

Blanche! - And don't forget it, bitches. - Whoa! - Excuse me, this is flat. - I beg your pardon? - It's flat. - What's the matter, Mildred? You inhale some of your drink up your nose? - Yeah, you did. - Is there something wrong with this drink? - No. - Good, thanks. - Let's go fuck in the back. - Bartender says it's fine. - But it's not fine, it's flat. - You think you know more than the bartender? - No, it's just, if I order something I'm gonna pay for, I expect it to be made correctly. - You're gonna pay for that drink or I'm gonna get Eddie to throw you out. - I guess I'll just drink it. - Yeah. - Great performance up there. - I know, right? Grammy speech! - Okay, well, I would like to thank my family, but most of all, I'd like to thank my millions of fans around the world. Well, this place blows. Let's go to Roxanne's across the street. - Great idea, Blanche. Oh, shut up, Nina. - Fucking bitch! Don't just stand there. Help me! Dave? - Hey, Mildred. Hi. How, how's the internship going? - It's good. - All right, I'm out of here. Have a good day. - Morning. - How'd that happen? - We were drinking. - Sounds like your night was more fun than mine. You know, Mildred, I could set you up with someone. There's a guy at my work. He's a little older than you, he's middle aged, and he's on the heavier side. He's got a little bit of a weird eye. - I don't wanna be set up with anyone. - Have you even gone on a date the entire time we've lived together? - A person's worth isn't measured by the number of notches in their bed post. - Don't you get lonely? - And I suppose having a different guy every night of the week gives you some sense of human connection? - Is that jealousy I detect? - No. - Maybe you should get another hobby. This weird shit is a real turn off to guys. What a crime! Listen, Mildred, you're not ugly. You could be attractive if you just fixed your nose. I know a doctor who can take care of it real cheap, like real cheap. Do you want me to set up an appointment for you? - Let me write this down so you understand. You know, Mildred, people are prettier when they smile. - Do you know how many times I've asked you for that report? Four, four fucking times, and I still don't have it, you little shit stain! Why are you here? Why are you even here? - I had something... You're doing nothing. You're fucking incompetent. Your mustache is stupid. You might dress like a porn star, but every one of those girls out there that slept with you said you're a shitty lay, so get the fuck out of my office! You dress like a fucking dweeb. Get out of my sight, get out! - Hey, Mildred. - Bye, Rick. Hey Blanche, you guys didn't pay last night when you... It's 9:15, Mildred. - Pardon? It's 9:15. - I don't understand what you mean. - Christ, Mildred. It's 9:15, and I still don't have my coffee. Didn't I tell you yesterday to bring me my coffee in the morning? Yes, I was going... 9:16 now, Mildred. Do you think you could get it to me by the weekend? - Yes, Blanche. Sorry. - Looking forward to the retreat? - I can't go, it's my sister's wedding on Saturday. I'm the photographer. - Too bad, should be fun. - Pictures are fun too. - Whoa. Watch it, new girl. You almost poked out my eye with your nose. - Come on, Lola, don't be mean. - It's not her fault she was born deformed. - Ugh. Ew. - Yes, Francois, I've already done it. No need to worry. Excuse me? What are those? - Cream and sugar. I didn't know what you took in your coffee, so I brought both. - Francois, can you hold for a moment please? Thank you. Mildred, come here. Closer. More. I'm gonna explain something to you. I'm VP of this company, do you know what that means? - Vice president? - Mm-hm, now as vice president, do you think it's a good use of my time to pour cream and sugar into my own coffee? Or do you think that's something an intern would do? - An intern, I guess. Bravo. Goddamn, Francois, where do you find these interns? The one with the enormous... - Francois wants you to run this over to Diane at the salon. - Lola, did you cross out your name and put mine down for Saturday? - Yeah, I wanna go to the retreat. Francois said I could. - My sister's wedding is on Saturday. I booked it off the day I started. - Remember what Francois said, our company motto? Be a team player. I can be a team player by going to the retreat. And you can be a team player by taking my shift. See, it's a win-win. - No, I booked that day... - Diane's waiting on that package, Mildred. Get on it. - Hey, Mildred. - Hi Felix, how are you? - Good, how are you doing? - I'm good, how are you? Oh, I just asked that. Oh my God, I'm so dumb sometimes. - Mildred, it's okay, I do it all the time. - Is Diane here? Yeah, she's just in the back there. - Mildred Moyer? Is that you? - Hey. - It's me Doris Ennis. - Yeah, I remember you. - How long has it been? - Since grade nine. - Remember at the school assembly when I yelled out that you had genital herpes? - Yeah, I remember. - You didn't come back to school after that, did you? - No, I switched schools. - We used to do a lot of mean stuff to you. So what's new with you now? Married, kids, anything? - No kids, not married. - I'm surprised you didn't get your nose fixed by now. God knows how much we teased you about it. Kids will be kids, right? Anyway, I gotta go. We should grab coffee sometime. - Yeah, okay. Here's your package. - Can you sign this? - Are you just gonna stand there? - Mildred, are you doing anything on Saturday? - Actually, I have to work. - Oh, oh, okay. - But not the whole day, why? - No reason, don't worry about it. - Did you want to, I mean, did you have plans or did, um... - I don't really have plans, but I guess if you're busy, then I guess I'll see you around? - Yeah, okay. - Well, can't you get Mildred to do it? Oh, Blanche and her friends are going out tonight. I'm gonna see if they let me tag along. Oh, the one with the big nose. - It's not a big deal. If you can't come, you can't come. What are the odds it's going to be my only wedding anyway? - Priscilla, why can't I be one of your bridesmaids? Mom said she asked you. - I don't know, Mildred. You just don't fit in. - You mean I don't fit into your unachievable ideal of beauty. - It's not that unachievable. Oh, come on, Mildred. You should have a thick skin by now. - Yeah, one of them had their tongue ripped out. Their eyes were gone. Some of them, their tents were ripped to shreds. - Gwen, what was that doctor's name? - I don't know how many times I'm gonna have to tell him if he wants to touch me there, he's gonna have to pay extra. - Hi, Mildred. I'm Dr. Wash. - Is it normal for plastic surgeons to work out of strip club basements? - It's been happening more and more. I started the trend though. - Oh, polka dots, wow. Hey, can I take this? - Sorry about the mess, but I can assure you, I am 100% professional. Beer? Mm-hmm. Sometimes the Lord sure can pull some cruel pranks. - That doesn't make me feel any better. - I'm not here to make you feel better. I'm here to make you look better. I bet hundreds of people told you that looks aren't everything. - Yes, I've lost count. - Something ugly people always say. Oh, I've altered that picture you sent to show what you would look like after the procedure. I take it you want to go ahead then? - Yes. - This is the start of a new life for you, Mildred. See you here tonight at 11. - 11, isn't that kinda late? - I've got an engagement I gotta attend beforehand. But time isn't what is important. Results are important. I'm gonna make you beautiful, Mildred. - Oh, thank you so much, Dr. Wash. - Oh, and Mildred, cash only. - Goodbye, you ugly bitch. - You're sure you're not too drunk? - I'm good. Great party. Thanks for the ride. Mm, you're beautiful. You got the money? Ah, you are a lifesaver. Come on in. - Was that a rat? - There are no rats in Alberta, everybody knows that. Just relax. Now, just count backwards from 10. And when you wake up, you'll be a new woman. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. - Hey, Dr. Wash. - Delmont. I was kind of in the middle of something here. - You've been dodging my calls. - I've been busy. - Busy is good, where's my money? I got some of it. - You just got back from Mexico with your family. Expensive trip, huh? - My wife paid for the trip. - That's a lie. I always notice a brand new car in your driveway. You know how that makes me feel when you're going living large and you owe me money. Who is this? One of your young girlfriends you fix up so you can take advantage of 'em? - She's just a patient. - Yeesh, I see why she wants a plastic surgeon. Maybe I can help. - No, don't! - Hit him in the gut! - I might not quite have your skills, Doctor, but I'll try my best. Then again, I don't think you want her back after I'm done with her. Here, you want some of this? - Fuck off! - It'll make a nice meal for the dog. Here, give me the rag. You think he got the message? - Yeah, I think so. God. Oh God! Hey, honey. Hi, yeah, I'm fine. Okay, listen, I don't want you to panic. I need you to grab Lacey. I need you to pack a bag, just the essentials. Hop into a car, get over to work and pick me up. No, don't worry about telling your mother, just hurry! - Dr. Wash. Dr. Wash! - Oh my God, what happened? Where is your nose? - I don't know, the doctor wasn't there when I woke up. Can you drive me to the hospital? - I can't even look at you. Can't you call a cab? - Prissy, please! Just because I look like this doesn't make me a different person! - Get away from me, you Bride of Frankenstein! - But I love you! - Ew, gross, Mildew! - Oh my God. I'm so sorry. - You fucking bitch! - By the way, it was me who ripped the head off your Baby Molly doll when we were kids. - Mildred? - Hi, Peter. - What happened to your face? - My baby noses fell off. Have a lovely wedding. Let me know if you need any help with photos. Prissy? - Oh Gwen, we could have been such good friends. You're right, Gwen. People are much prettier when they smile. Dave? - Mildred? Don't, don't kill me. - I won't, I have no problem with you. Except for maybe your taste in women. Promise to fix that? - Yeah, sure? - Okay, good. - What happened to your face? - Botched plastic surgery. - That sucks. - Yeah, totally. - So will you give me like 10 minutes before you call the cops? - Sure. Awesome, thanks. Oh, hey, should we hug? Bye. - Bye. - What happened to your face? Botched plastic surgery? - Yeah. - Damn, does it hurt? - Actually, quite a bit now that I'm out of chloroform. - Ah. You want this? - Oh my God, you're an angel! - I just want to help. - Ugh, that's nasty. Maybe just a bit more to numb the pain. - Were you doing coke in there? - No. - I share with you, you gotta share with me. - Christ, Marilyn, if I had some I'd share it. What do you think I am? - Why do you have my husband's shirt? - He left it at the gym. I brought it here so you can give it back to him. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. - Are you guys ready, we're all packed up. - Road trip! - How'd I get here? - I came back to the bench and found you passed out. Figured you might need someone to watch over you. - You guys live here? - No, we have a five-star hotel room. We're just hanging here in the woods for the inspirational atmosphere. - Patty says that you got your face fucked up from plastic surgery. Why'd you do that? - People convinced me I was ugly and needed plastic surgery. I couldn't afford a licensed doctor, so I went to a bargain one and he did this. - Talk about First World problems. - Physical appearance is a huge part of self-identity. It crippled myself self-esteem. - Yeah, look at us sweetheart. Like we really feel sorry for you. - I guess not. So why do you guys live here? - Drugs. - Drugs. - Drugs. - Economic downturn. Just kidding, drugs. So you got nowhere to live now? - I guess not. I killed my roommate and my sister, so I can't go home. The police are probably out looking for me. You guys have no problem with what I did? - My brother shot a cop, and he's on the run. Who am I to judge? - Good. Because a whole lot more people are gonna die. - You're looking a little gungy. Why don't I give you a mask here? I found it in the street. - Cool. How do I look? - Like a force of nature. - Thanks for everything, guys. - Give 'em hell, Mildred. - Marilyn, get the fuck away from my car. Your smoke's blowing in. What's taking that skank so long? She trying on clothes in there? Christ, Lola, how can you eat all that shit and still stay so skinny? - Fuck you, it's not all for me. - It wasn't an insult, I'm jealous. You wreak like a fucking ash tray back there. I should make you ride in the trunk. - Fuck you, Blanche! - Oh God, look who's here. Please, don't come over here. Christ, what did I do to deserve this? Why did Francois even invite these losers? - Hi, Blanche. Hi, Lola. Hi, Marilyn. There's only three of you. I thought you said there was no room in the car for me. - There's not, you take up too much space. Maybe you should lay off the donuts at work. So funny, Blanche! - Well, bye, Nina. Hopefully you won't get into a car crash on the way out there. - See you there! - Hello, cruel world! - Where's Felix? - He doesn't work here anymore. He wasn't exactly a team player. - You know what? Every time I come in here, all the employees are rude to me. - What do you want me to do about it? - Whoops, I missed. No, stop! No! No, stop! Oh, please, no! - No! - Doris Ennis. Let's see what you've been up to after all these years. Oh, Doris is a teacher! I hated teachers, they were always so mean to me. But let's deal with the low hanging fruit first. Hi, Doris! - Holy shit. - It's me, Mildred Moyer. - What happened to your face? - Wow, you still don't like my nose. There is just no pleasing some people. You know, I never forgave you for all that shit you did to me back at school. - Yeah, what are you gonna do about it? - I don't know. I'll just make it up as I go. I wanna see something. I knew it. Genital herpes! - Where are you headed? - Roxy's on 137th, thanks. - Nice mask. - I know, right? Remember me? - No. - We had a disagreement about the carbonation level of a gin and tonic. - What the fuck are you talking about? - How can you not remember, I... Fuck it, I'll just kill you. Not so tough now that you don't have your douchebag bouncer to protect ya, are ya? Taking back my money, that drink was fucking flat! ♪ Heading down to the local bar, walked in the door ♪ - Last time I was here, you made fun of my nose while I was trying to sing. - I did? - May I have that pool cue? You know, it's rude to ridicule someone's physical appearance. - Well, I was probably drunk. - Are you drunk now? - Yeah. - Good, that'll make this less painful. And you, you were laughing while your buddy was making fun of me. - I'm sorry, I'm a terrible person. I only laughed 'cause I just wanted to fit in. I'll never do it again. - Hmm. Wow, remorse and insight into your own actions and the willingness to cease the inappropriate behavior. If more people were like you, the funeral homes would be less busy this week. As you were. I'll let you live, sir. - I no longer have a pool partner, can I just go? - Yeah, sure. Geez, at least try to maintain your dignity. Hey, if I see one more flat gin and tonic, I'm coming back for you, understand? I wanna see bubbles, goddamn it! Hmm. Hey, here you go. Thanks. You're a beautiful soul. - Beauty's not only on the inside. - Well, I can't judge your outside. I haven't seen your face. I've had worse. - Oh my God, that's like the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. Here, let's have a hug. - Okay. - Is that? Oh my God, it is. - So I'm at this big mansion party, man, running into these two kids, trying to tell 'em about music, man. I'm telling these guys, man, if it wasn't for the '60s, people really even really wouldn't know what love truly is. - Nick Zane, oh my God, I can't believe that's you. I'm your biggest fan. - You supposed to be a superhero or something? Superhero? What part of this doesn't scream serial killer? - So were you at the show tonight? - No, actually I was on a killing spree, but then I just saw you here and I was like, "Oh my God!" - Oh, well, nice to meet you. Do you want my autograph? - No, actually I got your autograph a few years ago at one of your concerts. I partied on your party bus for a few minutes before your guys threw me off. Wait a minute, do you remember what you did to me when I was drunk and vulnerable? - Wait, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't even start that, man. I never even touched you. - I know, but you didn't even try! Why not, am I not good enough to be one of your groupies? Do you know what it's like to feel unloved and unwanted? - Okay, get out of here you fuckin' psycho! You bitch! - No need for name calling. Hmm, and what to do with you? Fore! Not a good shot. Let's try the other one. Yes! Hole in one for Mildred, whew! Wakey, wakey, Tommy. - Who are you? - Mildred Moyer, remember me? - Mildred, what are you doing in my house? - What, I can't check in on my exes? - No. - I do admit it is a bit stalkerish, but now that I'm here, I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but it's great seeing you. - Okay, Mildred, you're starting to freak me out. You have to leave. - You cheated on me, Tommy. - What, that was in the 10th grade? - Do you know how much that hurt? - Well, we dated for like a week, and I kissed Kelsey Summers like once. I was gonna kiss you, but I was like worried that your big nose was gonna poke me in the eye. So you got that fixed? - Oh yes, Tommy, I've been fixed. - Okay, I'm calling the cops. - Hey, a ukulele? Check out this song I like. ♪ Casually suicidal ♪ ♪ It's one big cycle you can't ignore ♪ You've heard it before. Hi Kelsey, it's Mildred Moyer from high school. Do you remember in grade 10 when you kissed Tommy Sherlock? Did you know him and I were dating at the time? Okay, as long as you didn't know. Yeah, I actually saw him for the first time tonight since graduation. He's doing all right. Hi, Mrs. Sokel. Who are you? - I'm a former student. Ah, ah, ah, I wouldn't do that if I were you. The last person who tried that paid dearly. - Oh, okay, let's just calm down here. Obviously you need help, and I'm here to listen. - Oh, I'm far beyond psychiatry. - Who are you? - I'll give you a hint. You used to keep a box of tissues on my desk so anyone who needed to blow their nose during class had to come see me. You said it was in honor of my abnormally large nose. You made me play Pinocchio in the school play. Even though the play was Cinderella. - Mildred Moyer? - 'Tis I! - Why are you wearing a mask? Jesus Christ, what happened? - I got a nose job. - I hope you got a refund. - Humor as a response to terror, classic. What are you doing? - I'm here for revenge. I was on a roll, so I figure why stop? Aw. Here, let me take a look. Oh, oh! I'm sure you'll be fine. I'm not going to kill you. Some fates are worse than death. - No, no! - By the way, I read your book and it sucked! - All right, now I want sexy poses. Sexy poses. There you are, there you are, yeah. Perfect, perfect, there. Mm-hm, perfect, mm-hm. Oh, perfect, yes. Twirl, twirl for me. Twirl, mm-hmm, perfect. Yes! Mm, all right, so now you're a tiger. You're a tiger, yes, you are. Be on that Serengeti plain, just lusting, perfect. Now, you're running, you're running. You're being chased by a bear. You're being chased by a bear, run faster, run harder, run! Run, yes! Oh, all right. Now, you're a construction worker, and you're working a jackhammer and it's so difficult and so heavy and so hard to work it. We're going into convulsions, mm-hm. Spasm it up, come on. Harder, hard, more, harder, more spasms. All right, now you're turning it out. We're giving birth, giving birth. It's a demon baby and you're frightened, and you want to throw it away, you throw it away. You're doing perfect, yes. I am spent. We're done. - Hi, Vespa. - Holy shit! Who the fuck are you? - Mildred Moyer. I see you found yourself a new photographer. - What? - You hired me, remember? When I was just starting out my photography side hustle? You never paid me. - You, your pictures were terrible. - Really, because you used one as your headshot and got you that movie roll, which you were terrible in, by the way. - Fuck you! What do you want? - My money. - I don't have any cash. - That's okay, I'll take the payment in flesh. Oh, don't worry. Now, you can transition from rom-com to horror movies. Who now? My blood thirst isn't satiated, and I need someone to kill while I wait for my coworkers to return from the retreat. Think back, Mildred. Who in your past deserves to die for what they did to you? - Two more victims... - Has been described as... - Hate carnage. - Stabbed over 100 times. Fire at St. James High School. - Woman wearing a mask. - Police have cordoned off. Bringing the death... - Hey polka dot, what's the hurry? I can make you a lot wetter than that! - All right, I'll take you up on your offer. Turn around, pull your pants down. Let's go, let's do it. - Whoa, what is that? No, no, no, no, I don't think so. That's not... That's not where I was looking to go with this. - Well, you seemed interested a minute ago. Don't be a tease! - No, no, no, not in that. That's, that's not where we're trying to go here. - You're playing hard to get, I get it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's, I think I made a mistake. I'm just gonna go home here, okay? - I really pegged you for someone interested in this. No, no, you pegged wrong. - Come back, I love you! Ooh! You know, cat calling's rude and it never works. I really just can't think of anyone else who deserves to face my wrath. Now that I got this momentum, I don't wanna give it up. I'm just gonna have to wait for those bitches from work to return from their team building retreat. Wait a minute, Francois said I need to take more initiative. Why don't I go to them? Hey, thanks for letting me vent. - Yeah, I'm heading over to Beaver Lake right now. And I'll be back tomorrow. Okay, I'll see you later, bye. - Beaver Lake, you say. - Don't think about it, just write whatever comes to mind. Write as many positive qualities about yourself as you can. Don't worry about being embarrassed. Just let your mind flow. Let's keep it PG, everyone. - Don't embarrass us. I paid big money for this guy. - Pfft, should have paid me the big money. I can motivate these losers way better than douchebag Coach Hicks. - All right, guys, trust is very important. Trust each other, trust each other. - Oh, sorry, were we starting already? - I'll be damned, there is a God after all. - Daddy's gotta run to the bathroom. The beer's running right through me. - Well, hurry up. I'll feel much safer when we're in Saskatoon. - Oh, hey, sweetie, pass daddy a beer, huh? All right. - Hi, Dr. Wash, remember me? - Mildred! - I wasn't really satisfied with your work. I'd ask for a refund, but I'll settle for this instead. - I don't know what I'm gonna think about. I don't know how I'm gonna get that. I don't know, Mom. He, he won't tell me what's going on. He just says that we need to get to you and get to you really soon and it'll all blow over. I just. Oh fuck, I... - You might wanna keep this, as a memento. - Just hold, hold on, Mom. I just. - Who are you? - An avenging angel, who are you? - Lacey Wash. - Keep kicking ass, Lacey. - I always do. - Ugh, where did the truck go? That was my ride to the campground. Hey, I'm headed to Summer Grove campground at Beaver Lake. Can I catch a lift? - Hop in. - Thanks. You're not gonna ask about the mask? - Oh, I know who you are. You're all over the news, but I'm on the run too. Shot a cop. But you know, if you don't rat me out, I don't rat you up. - Deal. - Come on, everybody, come on! Come on, everybody, come on! - Come on, team! - Get up, you fat fuck! God, you're useless! I mean, way to go, everyone! Great teamwork. - You know, I'm tired of your little outbursts, and so is everybody else. - I play to win, that's why you hired me. That's why I'm good at my job. - We're here to have fun, not cut each other's throats in the name of competition. - These corporate retreats are so stupid. As if these bunch of morons are gonna come back to work on Monday and be productive all of a sudden. - You're not the boss, I am. And you will do as you're told. Do we understand each other? - Oh, absolutely, Francois. - So, why'd you do it? - Kill all those people? - Yeah. - Psychotic, cathartic release. - That's fucked up. You know, you can take the mask off if you want. - Might ruin your appetite. - I don't judge. - If you insist. - You have really pretty eyes. - Thank you. - I think it's getting infected though. - I know, but it's not like I can just walk into a hospital. - No, I know a doctor you could call, real discreet. - Last time someone recommended a doctor to me, didn't turn out so well. - This one's different, she's a real angel. I'll give you her number. - Thanks for the ride, good luck on the lam. And thanks for the contact. Give 'em hell, Mildred. - Don't stop now! Almost finished, we can do it! Good job, people. How does everyone feel? Tired. - Whoo, what a work out. Got my heart pounding. - Funny how your face is sweaty, but your armpits aren't. - It's because I'm not disgusting like you, Marilyn. You're such a cheater. - You rat me out and I'll tell Francois you've been fucking his husband! - Is that blackmail? - Leverage. - Good job, everyone. We've got one hour to chill out before we eat. See y'all at five. - Let's go get high. - Can I come? - Did you bring your own weed? - No. - Ah, too bad then. - Well, I'll bring some next time. - Sorry, I couldn't make it into work today. I wasn't feeling so good. - Mildred? Why? - Because you're a terrible boss, Francois. But don't worry, the company can easily replace you. I think there's going to be a lot of staffing changes at Blooming Wells in the next coming days. - Oh, my knee! - Let's see you try to run away now. Wow, initiative! I'm impressed. You know a part of me is actually cheering for you. Go Francois, whoo! Okay, that's far enough. It's chopping time! - No! - Do you know how to work this? Oh. There we go! - No! No, no! No! No! - Oh my God. - Mildred. Why are you wearing the mask? - To hide my disgustingly huge nose! - Oh yeah, right. Whose arm is that? - Seriously, that's your question? It's Francois's! Oh, are you insane? - Obviously! - No, no, no, no! - Ow! Stupid sliver! - Yeah, so the date really wasn't that good. - No? How big was his dick? - It was somewhere between Rick and Tim. - Ah, so not that big then? - What are you doing? You'll start a forest fire. - Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Park Ranger. Please don't give me a ticket. - Damn it! I was hoping to get more kills out of that. Took me like an hour to sharpen. - What the fuck? - Oh, sorry. It's me, Mildred Moyer. - Ugh, what happened to your nose? - Seriously, I just killed your friend, and you're still concerned about my nose? God, you guys really are heartless. - Why'd you kill Lola? - Don't worry. I'm gonna kill you guys too. Hmm, guess it only works in the movies. Guess I'm gonna have to take some physical action here. Okay. On your mark. Get set. Go! - No, stop, no, stop! Sorry, Marilyn! You're not seriously surprised she did that, are you? But don't worry, I'll get her back for you now. Hey, an ax! Oh, what are the chances there'd be an ax right here? Oh! Whoo, sharp, but still has the blunt force impact that is so satisfying. Hmm, good leverage too, easy to swing. Probably painful as fuck. Hey! - Please don't kill me. - I won't kill you, if you eat your foot. - Ugh, I can't, it's too chewy! - Mm, too bad. We have to do something. - You guys think it would be too convenient if Blanche died in an accidental hunting accident? - We have to stand up to her. We can't let her treat us like this. - We should threaten to quit. - Let's sue the company. Some of the shit she does has gotta be illegal. - That's not enough. - Francois! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Mildred Moyer's here! She's fucking snapped and killed Lola! - Is this part of team building? - No, you dumb shit, I'm dead fucking serious! Go look and see if she's out there! - Don't touch me. - Go look or you're out of a job. Oh my God, she's here, do something! - Hey guys, this is kind of awkward, but I'm really only here to kill Blanche. I mean, I'm sure you guys understand. The rest of you were actually really nice to me, so I have no problem with you. But I would recommend that you leave because I don't wanna traumatize you with what's about to happen. - You see, she's fucking crazy! You, go restrain her. - Fuck you, Blanche! We've worked together for a year, you don't even know my name. - Yes, I do! - What is it? - Mike. - Not even close. - Shit, whatever! Someone go hold her, we can hold her for the cops! Oh, come on, you fucking cowards! Oh, if we live through this, you're all so fired! Hi, Tim. - Hi, Mildred. You doing okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Oh, by the way, I finished off your TPS report and submitted it for you. - Thanks, Mildred. - Come on, guys. Teamwork, this is why we're here. This is a test, us against Mildred. - Well, let's be a team, guys. Let's get the hell outta here. - You can't just let her kill me. I'm a part of the team too. I'll give you all raises. I'll bump you up a buck an hour. A buck 75? - Fuck you, Blanche! - Bye, guys. Hope you had fun and learned lots about team building. - You didn't think I was gonna go down without a fight, did ya? I should have known you were a psycho bitch. Nobody that ugly could be normal. - Hey, I'm beautiful on the inside. - Are you really? - No, not really. Shit that hurts! - Come on, when was the last time you actually used yours? Not, the nose! That was supposed to look cooler. - I've dreamed of doing this since your huge nosed ugly ass face started at the company! No! Look, Mildred, I realize now that I shouldn't have treated you the way I did. I shouldn't have been such a bitch. Maybe it was the way I was raised. My dad left when I was really young, and my mom was an alcoholic. It was never personal with you. We all can't be born with good looks. I was just born lucky. I won the genetic lottery, I don't know. It doesn't mean that you're a bad person. Look, look, I know you're having some really tough times right now, but I also know that you can be compassionate. So what do you say, do you think you can find it in your heart to forego your revenge? I think we can get past this! Maybe we can be friends, I need some new ones anyway. - I'm not killing you for revenge, Blanche. I'm killing you for fun. 94, 95, 90, oh, sweet! Beat my grade six record. Hello, this is Mildred. We have a mutual friend, Danger Dan. He told me you could help me out with a new nose. Yeah, I can be there in two hours. Did he tell you how bad it was? Yeah, I hope so too. Okay, I'll see you soon, thanks. - And remember, don't not just go for it. - I won't! - Come in, let's take a look. Mildred, you look fine, here! - No, no, no, no, no, I can't do it. Here. - Oh my God. Oh my God, thank you so much. - Oh, you're most welcome, Mildred. That's just my son. He's a great boy, trustworthy. You should meet him. - Felix! - Mildred? What are you doing here? - Your mother fixed my face. - Oh, I'm so sorry, where are my manners? This is my sister, Mary. - Oh, sister. Yes, of course. Nice to meet you. Well, do you like my face? I'm beautiful now. - Mildred, you were always beautiful. ♪ Dangle your feet off the edge of a bridge ♪ ♪ Wonder what it would be like if you just let go ♪ ♪ Wiggle your toes, swing your legs back and forth ♪ ♪ Take a dance, take a chance while you're on the edge ♪ ♪ 'Cause you won't ever go ♪ ♪ You might be casually suicidal though ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ And people may offer advice ♪ ♪ They think they're being so damn nice ♪ ♪ Saying it's not worth the price and they're right ♪ ♪ But the fight doesn't end right then and there ♪ ♪ You're still casually suicidal ♪ ♪ It's one big cycle you can't ignore ♪ ♪ You're still casually suicidal ♪ ♪ You've always been and will be ever more ♪ ♪ And are they really surprised ♪ ♪ I think we've all been there a couple of times ♪ ♪ We all know, we all know ♪ ♪ We all can go, we all can go casually suicidal ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Take a nap in the middle of the street ♪ ♪ Count your sheep as you fall asleep on the cool concrete ♪ ♪ Kick off your socks, have your on the till foxtrot ♪ ♪ Step in time on the center line ♪ ♪ Feel the night fly by ♪ ♪ 'Cause you won't ever go, no, no ♪ ♪ You might be casually suicidal though ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ And people may freak out ♪ ♪ They don't know what ♪
