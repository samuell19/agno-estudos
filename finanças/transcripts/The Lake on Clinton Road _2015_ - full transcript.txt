White male, let me rephrase that, white male child, seven years old, dead, murdered, floating in a lake. Killed by his own mother. His own piece of shit mother! What do ya have to say about that?

It says we're five minutes away. I mean look, it's Clinton Road. Yeah, it said we were going the right way. I don't know. Should we keep going? Let's just get back in the car, come on, let's go. Let's get outta here, man. Hey, you guys wanna hear a joke? Sure. What do you call two football players, a cheerleader, her best friend, a fat white guy, and an anti-social black girl? Fucking lost! Oh wow man, this place is fuckin' sick! Let's go! Yeah! Oh shit! Welcome to the beach house! You do know that a beach house requires a beach, right? Thanks Stacey, I got that memo. I don't think ya did because this is just a house at the end of a long ass spooky road. Mark, you said we were going to the beach. What the hell, I left my friends in the cape for this? I could be sitting- - Babe, shh, relax, listen. I'm sure we'll find a beach nearby, OK? Yeah right. Right Alex, there's a beach nearby, right? Ah! Yeah, yeah, woo! It's my birthday, it's my birthday! I'm gonna go downstairs and check it out. Hey Alex, Mark, you wanna come over here for a second? - Coming! - All right. Hurry up! All right so, I have an idea on how we can pick the bedrooms. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I think I should get first pick of the room. Oh yeah, and why do you think you should get first pick? One, it's my birthday, and two, I'm the fattest one here! I deserve a big bed for this body! How 'bout Alex picks 'cause it's actually his birthday. Yeah Jamie. Yeah, she's right. Bro, go 'head pick your room man! So I can do my thing. I'm going in, I'm going in. Football, check, protein, I'm gonna see you tomorrow, baby. This is great, I deserve this. What babe? Don't what babe me, you said we were going to a beach house, Mark. Where's the beach? Can you help me find, is it comin' out later? Where's the beach? Maybe I missed it. 'Cause all I see is woods, like Jamie said. I left my friends in Mass for this? I'm not gonna hear the end of this, am I? Uh, no 'cause you got me out here in the middle of nowhere with the children of the corn. What's so funny? Uh, I'm sorry, can we help you? Yeah, I would just actually like to inform this lovely couple that Alex did find a lake. That's what's up, we out, let's go. That's not what's up. Thank you for the memo. A lake is not a beach. That's what I'm talking about! Babe, please just try to enjoy yourself. OK, we're not goin' anywhere soon, all right? OK? You guys have to admit, this is kinda creepy. Well hell yeah it is! Creepy? Far is more like it! You guys keep forgetting how fuckin' fat I am! I might as well roll down here. This is gonna be so much fun. I know, I love goin' on trips with you, girl! Remember last time? Hey party people! What's goin' on, check out my beach resort, mother fuckers! Nah, it's pretty cool, I mean it's not a beach, it's a lake, but what do you think babe? Yeah, this is no beach, but it's still romantic. We can just hang out, make a fire, have some drinks and play some games. Make a fire, that sounds good. I mean, it's not a beach, but who needs it? Mark, what do you think? I think we can make it work, man! What the hell, it has to work, right? Definitely. Woo, yeah, yeah, yeah! Hey you guys, I wanna thank you all- - You're welcome!

You're not gonna go in there, I'm certainly not gonna go in there. I've been drinkin' all night. I'm not goin' in the fuckin' lake and drowning, OK? Look, I'll tell you what, when I wake up in the morning time, I'll look for it myself. For now I wanna rest. Promise? I promise, OK, but seriously, what you did was wrong.

What do you mean it's not you, I'm confused. It's clearly you. I found this picture here in the house. How could that picture be here? Exactly, something is weird about this place Alex. Ever since I got in that lake, everything's been different. All I can do is think about that video. Babe, you're reading way too deep into things. Look, it's just a strange coincidence.

You shouldn't be scared, what the heck, it's just a road. Yeah, who cares. Remember, we're gonna prove to everyone that it's just a myth. Yeah, prove. Who's gonna get eaten, come on. There's gonna be a cougar, it's gonna come outta nowhere and just like rah! Oh, all right. She looked really terrified. OK, I better watch out for this cougar. You guys are nuts. You actually get out, it's gonna come after you. That's not funny. I think it is. He thinks it is, he's laughing. Hey, we got the driver to laugh, woo! This is an accomplishment. Is this the road? Are we here? I think so. That means it's time for you guys to get out. Is this the road? I thinks so, is it? I don't know, is it the road? I don't know, you're driving. All right, let's go. Get on it, guys. Come on Gabby, we got this. I'm gonna cut the lights on 'em. All right. Gonna scare the crap outta 'em. Just wait a minute. Oh my God, what if a cougar really came and ate them? Oh, the doors are locked, oops. What's your problem! That scared me! That was the whole point! I think she's crying. Oh my God, oh my God. Guys come on, what was gonna happen, I mean really. At least you two didn't go out there. We'll take control, come on. - Yeah. - I'm driving, I can't. Oh well, I'll drive for you. I can't do it, you two are the only two in line, so. Excuses, excuses!

What's your problem? No one likes you! You guys are such babies. What if there really were though, that's not funny. Are you kidding me, did you really just say that? Oh gosh. Yeah I really just said that. Well, don't 'cause then we have to smell it the whole way. After this road I need to get a drink. I am thirsty! We should go to Starbucks. I doubt there's Starbucks out here. Yeah, on Clinton Road, really? I'm really hungry too. I'll just get right on that, right. Starbucks is the place! Yeah! I'm gonna get my frappuccino with some whipped cream. Oh, you gotta get a freakin' muffin on the side. A muffin on the side. Or a cupcake. The red velvet! Oh my God, they are so good! Yeah, oh my God. I don't think you're gonna find that out here. And then I can put some chocolate syrup on top. Eww, that sounds really gross. All right, sing a real song now, this sucks. Will you guys shut up? You guys are really loud. There's headlights behind us, guys. That's weird, that's the first people I've seen. Oh, there gone, maybe they turned. Yeah, they're gone. Oh, maybe not. What? Guys, that's kinda weird, why are they flashing at us? I'm scared. Oh my God, guys what are they doing? Don't worry about it, they're just- - They're getting closer! Go faster! Drive the damn car! Go faster! Guys, that's just someone being stupid, it's fine. Don't worry about it. They're getting closer!
