INSPIRED BY TRUE STORIES AND THE BOOK "POR TR?S DO V?U DE ISIS" BY MARCEL SOUTO MAIOR THE MOTHERS OF CHICO XAVIER Why did you want to come fishing? You know I don't this crap. We need to spend more time together. Be closer to one another. Be a real family. Yeah, right, Mr. Mario. Well, if this is boring for you... we can leave. I just wish I hadn't come. I just came because my mom insisted. OK. Alright. So let's go. Let's leave. You know, this isn't so bad. Hey. Hey! Look at this, Mr. Mario. Look who's here. Hey. Yeah? Right on. You should enjoy more moments like these. Don't lecture me, Mr. Mario. OK, don't lecture me. Yeah, there's no talking to you. Now that it was getting good, we're leaving? You didn't even want to come. You complained endlessly. Remember? We could... We could do this again. Maybe. Go ahead. Come on, Ruth. Mom? Close your eyes. Give me your hand. So you won't forget this day. It had been a while since we went out together. Fishing results! Raul one fish! Mr. Mario, zero! - I didn't know it was a competition. - Oh, Mr. Mario... that's why you look so unhappy. See, mom? Yeah, you're dad is a sore loser. Losing was never really my best quality. - Where are we going, Mr. Mario? - I need to get some equipment. But it'll be quick. You coming? Alright, I won't be long. - Come with me, Raul. - No, I'm staying with mom. Come on. Stop being lazy. Let's go, give me a hand. Come on. He loves making me work. OK, Mr. Mario. Let's do it. Are sure it's here? Yes. It's a matter of life. - What's going on? - Everything's going to be OK, son. Yeah? - For who? - Just for a while. Dad! Don't do this, dad. - You can't make it on your own. - Don't do this. You can't do this! You can't do this! Dad, you can't do this to me! One day... he will thank us. Thank us, yeah. There was no other way, Ruth. A YEAR LATER Mom? - What's the matter, sweetheart? - A "mare". - A nightmare? - Yeah. It's over. It was just a dream. Give mommy a hug. There you go. It's over, OK? Look who's here. Mommy. Good morning. I'm going to open the window to spook away your nightmare, OK? Hello, dear Ruth, this is Mary. Sorry to bother you. I just wanted to let you know you are being missed. We all miss you very much. Kisses. Hi, hidden lady, I wanted to know if you looked at my thesis. Call me, OK? Ruth, this is Gabriel. You haven't said anything about the exhibition. So, are you going to do it or not? When will you have the paintings? We don't have much time. You're no going to the gallery anymore, like you said you would? You're going to stay home? Are you sure, Ruth? I'm ok here. I wish this was all a nightmare. - Last night I was thinking. - About what? Maybe I could have done something for Raul not to go down this path. We agreed we wouldn't talk about this anymore, didn't we? Did you think about the idea of hiring someone? To stay with you? I don't want to talk about that. You know you can stay like this. Confined. I have to go. I don't want to arrive late at the TV station again. Good morning. - Look at that. - A ham and cheese sandwich. No ham. What's up, Santiago? Why are you up so early? What's the matter? Karlzinho, Karlzino. - What's that? - Take a look. Awesome, Santiago. Awesome, bro. This is great. Give your brother a hug. - See, man? Your friend. - This is great, Santiago! Awesome. It took a while, but I finally made it. - You happy? When are you going? - Soon. You taking Lara? Did you speak to her? Not yet. - I got to go. I'm super late. - You leaving, man? Dude, lighten up. I don't get it. Isn't this what you wanted? - OK, so congratulations. - Thanks - We'll meet up later and celebrate. - Have a nice day. Cheers. Lica! Hi, sweetheart! Are you ready for your first day of school? Are you or not? - Elisa, Theo is so cute. - Isn't he? - Where's Ge? - He just left. He didn't wait to say good morning? - Oh, honey, he said he was late. - As usual. Elisa, he'll call later. That's how it's been, we only speak over the phone. Elisa! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come on, son. Lica, he get's out at noon, but I want you there at 11am. - And call me if you need anything. - Don't worry, mam. - Bye. Goodbye, Theo. - Bye. Come on, get to work! Hello. Yeah, it's me. What?! How? That is so irresponsible! Understand? I don't have to understand! Look, if you don't fix this crap... I am going to sue your ass! Understand? Morons! What happened, Mario? Raul ran away from the clinic. I knew this wasn't going to work. I know my son. - I'm calling the police. - No, Mario. Please. You go and try to find him. Bring our son home. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? Good. Are you his teacher? - I think so. How are you? - It's our first day here. - And what's your name? - Theo? Theo? What a beautiful name! Theo, here's the deal. Other than your house, of course... this is the coolest place ever. Did you know that? - No. - No? OK, go in, and I'll show you. - Bye, son. - Bye! - What's your name? - Elisa. Elisa, my name is Lara. You can relax, he'll be fine. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. And you? How are you doing? - Living, one day at a time. - Right on. - You that I... - I know. I know. Sit down. What's up? I want to show you something. - Have you ever heard of this guy? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. - What do you know about him? - What everyone knows. He's a famous medium. And do you know what he's doing? Let me see. Writing. But what exactly is he writing? An article from another world. Letters. Letters? To whom? According to him, they are letters from spirits. From people who died and communicate with the living. So he's one of us. The editor of our Heaven affiliate. At least, that's what he says. Why does he write with his eyes closed? I don't know. Do you want to go check it out? - What exactly? - The letters. See if the dead can really communicate with the living. Interesting. What about you? What about me? What do you think about this? You know me. I am suspicious about everything. - But I'll be honest with you. - Please, do. The man upstairs asked us to check this out. - Really? - Yeah. But why? To answer to our greater calling: Ratings. Amen. And I thought about you. So... you in? Mario... what exactly does the guy upstairs want for this job? - The truth. - That won't help the ratings, huh? You have a good opportunity to find out. We hardly ever get to work with the truth as a news reporter. Isn't that so? Don't get use to it. But enjoy. I will. Karl? - What's up? - Come in, man. - Want some coffee? - No, thanks. So where are you headed now, Mr. Adventurer? I was asked to explore new boundaries of communication. Damn, Karl. Another story about UFO's and aliens? No, this time it's communication between us and the dead. There's a medium, Chico Xavier... who communicates between the living and the dead. Have you heard of him? Yeah, man. Seems like it's for real. There's a ton of evidence. Right. Karlzinho, Karlzinho. I didn't come to stir things up. I came to say goodbye. So you made up your mind? And has Lara been told? - Not yet. - What you waiting for, dude? I don't know. The right time. - Is there a right time for bad news? - You know her, man. She's stubborn. It's complicated. Santiago, I'm sorry. I have to read all these books. I'm going to finish packing. I travel tomorrow morning. The show must go on. My little bro. - Have a nice trip. - You have a nice trip, man. - Keep me posted. - Don't worry. Good luck with Chico Mendes. Raul? - Is that you? - What's the matter, Ruth? Did you hear that? It's nothing. You were dreaming. Go to sleep. Good night. Very well. - What's the matter, doctor? - Se this blinking dot right here? No. This little seed. This? This little tiny piece? That's a human life. You're going to be a mom. How far along am I? I think about five weeks. Maybe a little less, maybe a little more. That's not very far along, right? Yeah, it's the beginning of a long lasting life. Can I leave, doctor? Since your son likes the beach, we think this is... Can I make a phone call? Lt'll be a minute. - Sure. - Just a minute. Please, go ahead. Dr. Guilherme's office. Good morning. Hi, Mrs. Elisa. How are you? Thank God. Dr. Guilherme is in a meeting and he asked not be disturbed. Yeah. I know. Theo's birthday is very important... but he asked not be disturbed. Alright. Thank you. Mrs. Elisa? Mrs. Elisa? If you allow me, I'll help you throw an unforgettable party. Sure. Please do. - How old is your boy? - Five. He's going to be five. He's a God sent angel. So this is going to be perfect for your son's birthday party. Lica? Lica? Where are you going? - For a ride. - But it's too hot. - It's after 3pm already. - But it's still hot. And the boy's going to get sick. - Let's go. - Lica! Don't go. You're going to regret it. Lica! Be careful. Ready? Look at that! The yellow one. See it? - Faster or slower? - Faster! - Welcome. - Nice to meet you. - You OK? - No, don't worry. - As you wish. - It's hot here. Very hot. Did you have a nice trip, doctor? It's was good. Don't call me doctor. I'm not a doctor. - Alright. - Just Karl. So where we going? I thought we could go to Chico Xavier's Prayer House. - You know where it is? - Oh, who doesn't? Everyone here likes Chico. I can tell. From what I hear about this man... he does thing that even God can't believe. Yeah. They say he writes letters from people who have died. And does a lot of charity work, too. He gathers a crowd of needy people underneath an avocado tree. You know why? To donate food and money. What about letters from the dead? Doesn't that sound a bit fishy? I don't know. Chico never benefited from anything he does. He still lives in the same house, same lifestyle, no luxury. Hey, let's go by the hotel first. I'll drop off my stuff and prepare a bit more. As you wish. Let's go. You won't believe what I found for Theo's birthday party. Calm down. - Calm down, Elisa. Calm down. - What happened? He hurt himself. He was bleeding a bit, but everything is alright. - How did this happen? - We went riding the bike... - and a dog attacked us. - Was he bitten? No, the dog was on a leash. I told her not to go out. But she's stubborn. She doesn't listen to me. She's scatterbrained! The dog scared me. I lost control of the bike... and Theo fell down. But he didn't hurt himself very bad. Come here, honey. Come. Look at me. - Are you OK? - Yes. - Is your head hurting? - No. Give me a hug. Hello? Good morning. Is this Chico Xavier's house? - Yes, it is. - Hi, my name is Karl. I'm a reporter. - Could I speak to Chico's son? - Eulipides isn't home. OK. - And Chico Xavier, how is he? - He's fine, thank God. Cool, that's great. Can I speak to him? No, he can talk right now. OK. Can I leave the number for my hotel? Who knows he can call me back? Sure, you can. The phone number is three, three, two... six, eight... six, seven. As soon as his son get's here, I'll ask him to call. You're welcome. Have a good day as well. These guys don't give up, do they? - Hi, Chico. Did you call me? - I did. When my son gets home... tell him to open the doors for the young man who called. - But, Chico, it's another reporter. - Yeah, I know. But this one is going to help us. Well, if you say so, I'll obey. I don't say anything, Emmanuel does. Don't worry. This young man is going to come to us again. Chico? - Is your back still hurting? - Barely. Don't deny it. Nothing that prayer and the right medication can't fix. Chico, please. Don't go to the Prayer House today. Geesh, why wouldn't I go? Your health isn't too great. You barely ate anything... and spent the day fighting with the tracer, I saw you. If I waited for everything to be perfecty fine... I wouldn't have started doing anything in my life. I'm just asking you to rest. That's all. I can't leave the people who need me waiting. Chico, I'm sorry for saying these silly things. I just care so much about you. My child, people who passed away... want to communicate just as badly as the living do. Nostalgia is something that hurts in both worlds. Mom? What, my angel? Why isn't daddy home? - Your dad's working. - Can I wait for him? Sure. - What do you want with your dad? - I want him to take us to the beach. The beach? Did you know it's almost your birthday? Yes. - I'm going to be this much. - You're going to be this much. Did you know you can ask for whatever you want? I want to go to the beach. OK, then you'll go to the beach. Right on. Do you know I love you? - I know. - You're my everything. God bless you. Chico, I'm the reporter from the city... who left a message at your house. I need your permission to film this house, your work. - Will you give me permission? - I'm not the one who can do that. And... does he give me permission? Yes. What do I do, Chico... to see the signs? Just look and you shall see. It's not that hard. I haven't been deprived from that sense. I'm glad about that. Let's go. "Dear mom, dad, I ask that you bless me. It's all clear before the memory I have about all that happened. I'm doing well here. And I already learned a lot. I miss you very much. I want you to tell Uncle Renato that Aunt Maria is well... and she's asking him to take care of Paula and Betinho. We will always be thinking about all of you. I love you very much. Leonardo Vieira." God bless you, my child. "Mommy, it's me, Mateus. I want to tell you something I didn't have time to tell you. Very well, what happened to me was accident. It was nobody's at fault. I forgive everything that happened between us. I didn't know what I was doing. I ask that you forgive me. I need that to stay in peace. Kisses from your beloved son. Mateus." I want to end our comforting meeting... thanking Jesus Christ's inspiration... our greatest example of love and peace on Earth. I also want to say that... without God in your heart... future generations will put life on our planet at risk. Chico, to end my story... I need to hear a little something from you. It's very important. Something quick, wherever you want. Whenever it's good for you. You're still not convinced of what you saw. I am. Chico, please. Please. Look for the mothers. I'm just an instrument. Nothing more. Excuse-me. So, Elisa, what's going on? What happened with Theo? He had a headache and... I brought him here right away. Was it because he fell off the bike? He only got two stitches. The tests didn't show anything. Where is he? I want to see my son. He's in ICU. ICU? Oh, my God. Elisa? I'm sorry, Elisa. It was my fault. I should have been there. I... - Mario, we have a problem. - What? - Chico isn't going to talk to us. - OK. OK, alright. I'll deal with it. I'll make some calls from here. No, no, it won't help. I want to make a proposal. I want to make a story about the mothers who got the letters. No, Karl, that's not the way to go. People don't care about that. All they care about is Chico Xavier. Because they don't have any idea of what's going on here. It's very powerful. There are hundred of stories. I think we can show a whole sequence on them. You should come to Uberaba. - It's unbelievable. - I can't go. But OK, go ahead. Do your job. I'll see what I can do from here. I'll think of something. OK, thanks. Stay well. Bye. Who got here late? - Rafa? - No. - Marcela? - No again. - Give me a hint. - She's beautiful. Oh, it's Ju. No? Dani? - Who's Dani and Ju, Santiago? - My students. You didn't invite me to your party? - It's not a party. - No, than what is this? It's the last day of our painting class. You OK? Aren't you going to give me a kiss? I need to talk to you. I also need to talk to you. Let's go outside? Oh, my God! Courage. I never thought I'd have the courage to do what I'm about to do. But I think it's a good moment. I made copies of my apartment keys. I want you to move in with me. Lara... Lara. Lara, wait. Let's sit down. Come on. I know you must be wondering why. We don't know each other that long, right? But... I don't think it's too soon. Do you? We have so much in common. Don't you think? Lara... What's this? You're going to Madrid? Weren't you going to tell me? I'm telling you now. I waited my whole life for this Master's scholarship. What do you want me to say, Santiago? I don't know. Anything. Congratulations. I can go with you. I don't know. So many things. I just wish you hadn't ruined everything. I asked you to marry me, and I ruined everything? I guess I was mistaken. When are you leaving? As soon as possible. Lara? Lara? Lara? Lara? - Are you OK? - I'm OK. I'm fine, Santiago. I'm pregnant. Oh, I miss this! Can you please turn that off, Mario? What? I can't believe it. Did you forget? Who would know? What are you talking about? Today is our wedding anniversary. What do want as a gift? We can go on a trip. - Want to? - No, I'm alright. No. We are not alright here. We both need some fresh air. - I can't leave this place. - Why not? You know. Please, just one dance. You can't turn me down today. Come on. We're filming now, OK? First off, I want to thank you for letting me in your house... for this interview about an intimate and very delicate subject. To begin... I want to know how it's been dealing with Rangel's absence... these past months. We don't have time to think about the nostalgia. It comes very quickly. It comes when... For me it came at a very troubled moment... with two small children. Life demanding I be at work... at the school where I taught. The families asking for me. So I can tell you I spent... several months feeling as if I had no time to cry. - Give me your cash! - I don't have any. Give me your watch! Make him shut up! Wake up. Wake up! You're alright. Easy. Easy! Easy, it's alright. You're OK. Get up. Get up. You're OK. You're going to help this guy? He's the one who did this. Denying help to people in need help is inhumane. Are you OK? I'm fine. Answer, Santiago. Good news. What is it? You had a some bleeding, Lara. It's always worrisome... but you can relax. The baby is fine. Everything is alright. This is normal in first pregnancies. You don't have to worry. What about the baby's dad? Did you speak to him? About what? About what happened, about the baby. This baby doesn't have a dad. He left. Disappeared. Yeah, that's also normal with first-time dad's. Doctor, I want to ask you a question. Is it also normal for a woman not to want to be a mom? No, Lara. And you better not think about that. Think about your health and the baby's health. I don't like I'm prepared for this. Honestly... you're being just as selfish as the baby's father. No, doctor. It's two completely different situations. Are you sure, Lara? Both of you are only thinking about yourself. Lara, take your test results and rest. Understand? Take my card, too. All my phone numbers are here. - You can call anytime. - Thanks, doctor. Mrs. Elisa. Hi. Sorry, I couldn't help... but notice you come here everyday at the same time. Sorry. I don't want to bother. No worries. It's no bother at all, but I would like to talk to you. I have to go. I want to give you something. Is that OK? Let's sit down? I thought you'd might like to have this drawing Theo made. Elisa, I... I don't even know what to say. I'm still in shock. I'm so sorry. - You're going to think I'm crazy. - Why? I come here everyday hoping I'll see my son come out of school. Really? I miss him. The desire to be with him is stronger than me. I don't understand that feeling. I can't understand. Have you ever thought about... giving up your life for someone else's life? Every night before I fell asleep I prayed. I asked that my son's life be preserved before mine. That I'd trip a thousand times before he fell. I don't understand. Sometimes I think I am not fit to be a mother. You need a lot of courage, I guess. The years I spent with my son were the best years of my life. Aren't you angry? With who? I don't know. With life, with God. That's a lot of anger. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Stay strong, OK? Ruth! Did you bring the money? Take four at the same time and wait. Thanks. Do you forgive me? For what? For my absence. Had I been here, this wouldn't have happened. That's not true. I did everything we could've done. I didn't let go one minute. I don't know why it happened, but I know it wasn't our fault. It was the babysitter. I don't know why she's here. We need to call the police on her. She needs to go to prison. Justice must be made. What would that matter, Ge? I'm going to go talk to Chico. Chico? Why Chico? He's not going to bring our son back. I know. But I need to speak to him. You think you're better than me. Better than everyone because you think there's life after death. I don't think I'm better than you. I don't think I'm better than anyone. I just think he can help us cope with this. It's already so much. I don't know what to do with you. - Nor with this marriage. - Please. Don't use me as an alibi to justify your stupidity. I want to help you, Guilherme. You're just like everybody else. You only think about having faith and God... when tragedy knocks on our door. You don't know what you're talking about. Oh, no? I'm not going after anyone to hide my guilt. I'm paying for what I did not do, Elisa. That's all. Good luck. That's what we need the most, Guilherme. The master of our harvest is what we sow, what we reap. Or else we blame God a lot. And we are responsible for everything that happens to us. Some extremely fantastic things... happened, you know? Really fantastic. So much so for us to say, "Yes, there is something out there." Because it's not possible. Simple things... are what elevate us. I know exactly what I am talking about. So? What do you think? These letters, Mario, are Chico's greatest legacy. Do you know what he said about them? Look. "The task of bringing comfort to families in despair... through the letters is what gratifies me the most as a medium." Let's air it. I'm sure our boss is going to like this. I didn't do it for him, Mario. I did it for you, man. Thanks, kid. When you finish editing, make me a copy, OK? A huge accident happened today in the late afternoon. Witnesses say it all started with a robbery. They say the driver was shot and lost control of the bus. The bus turned over and caught on fire... My God. My God. Karl? Hi. - Hi. - Can I come in? What do you want, Karl? - Did Santiago send you here? - No, Lara. Santiago has nothing to do with this. I mean... What? It's is very hard for me to have to tell you this. Santiago was in a serious accident. He didn't make it. Tell your friend he doesn't have to make up lame excuses. I get it. He went to Madrid. He doesn't want to be with me anymore. OK. I'm not going after him. I don't have to... I have a VHS tape with images of the accident. You can see Santiago's body. - Dead, on an ambulance stretcher. - It's not true, Lara. It's not true. I'm here. That's not true. He's in Madrid. I went to the morgue. I saw him. I identified his body. He was a John Doe. - He had no ID. - Stop, Karl! What do you mean? I'm so sorry, Lara. - That's not true. - I'm also in shock, Lara. You're lying. Stop it. No! You have to be strong. What now? Now rest. And Lara? Don't worry. I'll make sure she gets to you. Now rest. Rest. GE, SO YOU WON'T FORGET HOW WE ARE. ELISA Theo, give daddy the ball. Right on! Come, Elisa! Come, get in the water! - Come! - Come on! Come on! It's cold. You look beautiful. Thank you. - Let's go. - Are you ready? Totally. Come. What if he doesn't want to see us? Come on, Ruth, we have to try. With faith, everything will work out. I'm glad you're here. Guilherme didn't want to come. Your husband really needs our help, but we... need to reach out to him. My child, did you thank your babysitter? No, Chico. I truly forgave her... but I did not thank her. You should have. Your son was destined to leave any which way. She was an instrument of his departure. Imagine if he had fallen from your lap, not the bike. Would you stand the guilt? No. Thank you, Chico. Thank you. God bless you, child. "Dear Mommy, I know I made you suffer a lot. I didn't know what I was doing. Now I understand everything you told me. You were right about everything. I ask that you forgive and bless me. Your beloved son, Jo?o de Deus." God bless you. "My dear parents... I beg for your forgiveness... for having caused you so much suffering and pain. Now, everything is clear in my memory. But it wasn't before. I blamed everyone for my mistakes. I was weak letting drugs and evil spirits... control my desires. More than anything, I was a coward." The joy of living was not part of my spirit. My head was a vortex of shadows... controlled by confusing and contradicting ideas. Raul, where were you son? Nowhere. - Were you using drugs? - No! Are you OK, son? - Go to sleep, will you? - You think I can? Back off! Leave me alone! Don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother. Mother? What mother? What's going on with you? Give me a break. Talk to me, please. We don't talk anymore. We only talk to people we trust. Oh, son. Forgive me. - Forgive me. Please. - Leave me. Leave me alone! I wanted friends, but I felt very lonely. I really ignored everything. And forces, different from mine, dominated my thoughts. I was no longer in charge of my destiny... and acted not knowing that invisible hands guided me. Ruth? Mario... - Raul is here. - Raul? Raul is here? He locked himself in the room... In the blink of an eye, everything fell apart before me. Raul? Son! Son! - Son! - No! No! Hey! Let me out, dammit! It's going to be alright, son. - Raul, where were you, son? - It's going to be alright, son. Yeah? - What is it? I'm your mother. - Mother? - I can't take this anymore! - Talk to me, son. Trying to take my own life led me to even more suffering. I didn't know where I was. I wanted to get out, but I couldn't. I hurt for a long time. For years and years in a spiritual world. Hungry. Cold. Dismayed. And much lonelier than I felt before. Then my grandma Yvonne came to my rescue. Come. It's my son. It's my son. It's Raul, Mario. It's our son. Since that day, I'm being prepared for this encounter... that illuminates my soul and fills it with peace. How do you feel, Raul? Happy. Very happy. - Are you ready? - Yes. Thanks to you. You can correct your mistakes, Raul. Now it's all up to you. That's what I want the most. Thank you. Thank you so much. Let's go. "Dear Mommy, I ask that you not cry for me anymore. Help the needy and forgive me from the bottom of your heart. Only charity and forgiveness can... offer us the path to salvation. The joy of this moment, my beloved father is eternal. It'll stay with us until the day we meet again. From your beloved son, Raul." Theo is present. Can you see him? "Dear Mommy... it's me. Your son, Theo. I'm here with my teacher. He's helping me write... because I'm still learning. I see you. I miss you. But the joy of being here surpasses everything. I was already sick when I talked and played with you. Then I hit my head on the ground and became strong. My head hurt, not from the bike accident... but from the disease I was born with. Lica was not to blame." Go, Theo! Go! Kick the ball! Theo scored a goal! I don't know how to do this, Guilherme. I suck at it. Come, give me a hug! Go, sweetheart. Go. I didn't have the guts to go in. I tried, but I can't. What matters is that you're here. Yeah. And? He came to us. Our little boy. Here. - How do you know it's him? - He talks about me and you. About my dad. He said it wasn't Lica's fault. Chico... and my interview? - You're very persistent. - It's not me, it's my job. Have you ever seen our avocado tree? No, not yet. I want to ask you to go see it. That day, we can talk. - Hi. - Hi. My child... life is a supreme blessing. Nothing is more important than life. Santiago said he's sorry. He's not ready to write yet. But he's asking you to preserve the life within you. He also says... that after you guys met at the square... found out how much he loved you. Thank you. God bless you, child. "When I cried because my head was hurting, you called my dad. He was frightened and scared. Then I didn't see anything else. Everything got dark. Then I heard my dad crying for me. I wanted to answer, but I wasn't able to. I couldn't answer anymore. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up I was close to my great grandma... who hugged me and said she'll take care of me, like you did. Ever since then, I'm surround with affection and love. Therefore, mommy... don't cry for me anymore. I'm alright. Be strong. Help my dad. I want him to remember the happy moments we had... like our trip to the beach when we pretended we were divers. Nothing will ever erase the memory of those happy moments." On day we'll be together again. I love you both. Your son, Theo. How's this possible, Elisa? How did he know all this? It's our son. Theo!
