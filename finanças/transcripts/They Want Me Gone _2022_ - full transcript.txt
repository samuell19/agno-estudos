[fire crackling] I saw the two of them. Coming through the backyard. Toward the house. And when I heard them breaking in... I hid. I saw everything they did. [fire crackling] And I went to live with my aunt. And I tried to save up to get out of here. Then, she passed away when I was 18. Then, I had no one. Except David. But, we were so young. But then, we had Jessie. And even though she was unexpected... I love her more than anything. I guess that's why I always imagine the worst things happening. [fire crackling] [door creaking] [door latch clicking] - Good girl. - Good girl. Mom? How young do dogs die? [Monica] Uh, that depends, you know? If we take good care of them, they can live for a long time. Kids at school were saying that dogs die really young. Yeah, well, the thing about that is that for every year in a person's life, it's seven years in a dog's life. So, even though it kinda seems like they don't live for very long, they actually have very long lives. Is Rooter older than you? Yes. She is. She's older than me. I mean, not, like, 700 years older than me. She's been around for a bit, though. She... she didn't want me to tell you. She wanted it to be a surprise. But... Rooter has a plan for us, you know? [Jessie] What's her plan? Well, she's been working on it, and I think... I think she wants us to have a new home. Maybe a place where we can all be together. Be safe and warm, and... she can dig anywhere she wants. Dig up the couch? [Monica] She does like to dig up the couch. - [Jessie] Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. Rooter wants to take care of us. She wants us to have the best life we can. All righty. Time for sleep. - I love you. - Love you, too. - [Monica] Good night. - Good night.

I also heard that they might be hiring an assistant manager down the line. I mean, I don't know how much pull I'll have, but if you keep doing what you're doing you're gonna be the front runner. Okay. Well, what? [Monica] Nothing. What? I don't want it. What? [Monica] They should give it to somebody else. You don't actually have it yet. Well, I don't want it. So... You are so frustrating.

Today in class, we got to play a game where you have to pass around the eraser without the people knowing who has it, and it was my turn to guess who had the eraser, and, um, my friend had it, and she passed it to somebody else, and I thought she didn't actually pass it. You know, I thought that she did. But, um, when I said "I know that you have it, you can just go now," to the person that she "gave" it to... and then, um, she didn't have it, and everybody was laughing at me. Who's class was this? [Jessie] Mrs. Fisher. -[David] She know -[distant clicking] You were playing this game? [Jessie] Yeah, she was the one that taught us the game. You know, the last time I saw Mrs. Fisher, she mentioned that her son had moved to the east coast... for school. And he really likes it there. Would you ever wanna live somewhere new? Somewhere different? I'm just saying that if we're gonna talk about it that we should talk about it together. [cutlery banging loudly] Enough.

How can I help you? Hi, um, I'm calling to ask what it might cost to get stitches... for a leg injury. [operator] It depends, uh, who is your insurance provider? I don't have one. [operator] And what is the severity of the laceration? I don't know. It's pretty bad. [operator] So, depending on how many stitches you need and without health insurance... Between that and the visit, it can cost anywhere between $200 and $3,000. I see. - [operator] But if you do... - Thank you. [operator] Feel you need stitches, you do... [sighs] [store din] [machines buzzing] [buzzing continues] You'll figure it out. It's going to be fine. Just have to hope nobody finds out what you did. You know what you should do is just... contact anybody you can think of who might have a job opening. I don't really want to do that. You don't really have a choice, do you? We could just move. We meaning you and Jessie? Yeah. [sighing] Do you really think that that's best for her? Yes, I do. What about David? [Monica] What about him? I know he mentioned that maybe she should come and stay with him for a little while. What do you mean? I don't know, I just... think that could maybe be a good thing for her. What do you mean, he mentioned it? Yeah. Why were you guys talking about this? [keys jangling] [drawers slammed shut] You know, I, um, actually made plans tonight, so, I gotta get going.
