Look, I've got a lot riding on this deal. I'll do whatever it takes to develop this property. What's unclear about that? Yeah, well, push back harder. Don't wanna hear from you until it's done. - Mm. Your lawyers? - Mm-hm. Mmm-hmm. - Mmh. - Wait. Wait, wait. You're gonna spill it. Mm. Mm! Whoo! Mm. Naughty. Oh, my God. - Stop, Richard! - What? No. No, wait. Wait, wait. Stop! No! So, what I was thinking is that, we... Stop! I haven't started yet, Ms. Romero. Every firm I ever fired, I fired because they never lived up to the presentation. We do things differently here. I've heard that line before, too. If I'm going to share the wealth, you're going to have to sell me something new. I will always listen and understand your financial goals and aspirations. Now, let's not dwell on the past and let's focus on your future, Ms. Romero. Mm. Well done signing Eva Romero. I expect you to be at the partners' meeting tomorrow. Congratulations. Go home. Celebrate with Michael. Hi! It doesn't matter what state I'm in, every opposing counsel in this case are jerks. No class in class action suits, right? That's a partner texting. It better not be the one that looks like Salma Hayek. No, Penelope Cruz. Oh, and I gotta do deposition prep all night again. Oh, I guess that means we can't celebrate with FaceTime sex. Celebrate what? I made partner. Great. Congratulations. Some of your luck will rub off on me. It wasn't luck, Michael. I-I didn't mean it like that, Angela. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just fried from this case. I am, I'm really happy for you. - Really. - Thanks. Um... I gotta go. We'll, uh, we'll celebrate later, okay? I miss you. Miss you, too. - Hi, Don. - Angela. Come by the conference room for a VIP meet-and-greet. Yeah, of course. Just expanding my portfolio this year, okay? Hi. Ange. Kyle? Hi! Eh, it's been a while. So you two knew each other from college. Yeah. Yeah. We do. Kyle's manager is a college friend of mine. And when Kyle found out you worked here... I told Don there's only one person that can convince me to become an Apex client. Let's not prove him wrong. - Welcome. - Thank you, Don. All right. This is so strange. In a good way though. Yeah. How are you? I'm... I'm great. I'm living my dream. I'm a photographer. - That's amazing. - Yeah. You always wanted to do that. Mm-hmm. I did not mean for this to be that awkward. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm just... I'm just surprised. Look, let's just think about this as business between old friends. You don't need to sell me. Okay? The last manager I had that was dealing with my money was a complete scumbag, so all I need now is someone I can trust. Well, you came to the right place. So, um, you know the drill. I need all of your financial statements and then we can go from there. I hope that includes catchin' up. - I can do that. - All right, cool. Uh, sorry, how is this gonna work logistically, with you traveling so much? Well, that's easy. I'm moving back here. Wow, it was really great to see you again. You too. Would you stop it? Don't tell me you have never Googled or friended him. I haven't. God, when you said you wanted to move on, you weren't kidding. You know it wasn't an easy breakup. Yeah, well, that's why I never mentioned that I followed him. What? Did you know he was moving back, too? All you had to do was look. Ooh, he's a big deal now, Ange. He has been around. Oh, and still available. Stop! That's my favorite E.E. Cummings' quote. Well, somebody didn't move on. Hey, baby. You're getting an early start, too? Yeah, I couldn't sleep. So I'm picking you up from the airport tomorrow? Oh, damn, uh, I meant to tell you. The depo schedule in Detroit got moved up. Oh. Okay. I know it's been brutal with my schedule, Ange. But I promise you, it's short-term pain, long-term gain. Is that what it is? Absolutely. So, um, Kyle Miller moved back into town. Yeah? Yeah, he's an Apex client. He wants me on his account. - Oh, great. - So you're fine with that? I don't care what you two had back then, I... I only care about what we have now. Besides, you imagine all the money you're gonna get from his trust fund. Ah, damn. I, uh, I gotta go. Bye. Tsk, I'll catch you later, all right? Okay. Bye-bye. Hi! Can I get a large coffee to go, please? Yeah. Mm-hm. Thanks. Oh, hey, Angela! - Kyle. Oh. - Hey, come join me. Yeah, uh, just for a few minutes. I've got a busy day. This was our place, remember? I know, it's hard to imagine that this place used to be a greasy spoon. Yeah, I know, right? You know, what I can't get over is you in the business world. I know, and somehow that is how it worked out. What happened to you becoming the next great American novelist? Ah, well, um... After school I couldn't pay off the student loans. So I got an assistant job at Apex and a few years later, they offered to pay for my MBA. So, here we are. Man, you sure did have a way with words. I think the literary world will be fine without me. Ah, their loss. So, um, I have to go. But... let's set something up for you to come into the office and go over everything. Yeah, lookin' forward to it. Okay. - I'll see you. - Okay. Do you think Michael's having an affair? Tsk, I guess I would be the expert in that department. No, Laurie, I'm not judging you for your past relationships. I know, I know, um... Tsk. I think Michael is more seduced by success. Besides... he knows that if he cheated on you, I'd kick his ass. That's true. I have a question for you. Shoot. What does Kyle think about you being with Michael? So, Kyle, I'm recommending some significant tactical tilts in your portfolio so that we can take advantage of short-term discrepancies in the market. Wow! - Listen to you. - What? You just don't sound like the English major I once knew. Do you ever write anymore? For fun? No. Ever think about it? Uh, it's just not really where my mind is. I have clients to think about. I also think that we should go modest overweight to high yields because they're attractive right now. - Is that what they are? - Yes. How attractive can a yield be? Barring a recession and low oil prices, very. Oh, hey, look at that high yield over there. - Check that out. - Kyle. What's the status here? See, now this is exactly why I couldn't study with you in school. Well, I can focus when I have to. Answer the question. Michael is my boyfriend. That wasn't too hard now, was it? - How'd you two meet? - At a bar. It was a karaoke night, actually. Oh, he must have loved your voice, huh? I only sing decently in the shower. - That's true! - Kyle! Couldn't resist. So what does Michael do? He's a lawyer at a class action firm. He travels a lot. So what about you? You have anybody special? Oh, no. No. I haven't been anywhere long enough to really commit to anything other than work, you know. Yeah. But, that's why I'm moving back here. Gonna settle down and plant my roots. Excuse me. Hi! Just wanted to remind you it's one o'clock. Okay. Just wrapping up. - Sorry, I have another client. - Oh, that-that's okay. Look, let's just keep this simple. And, uh, make sure that I get a decent single-digit return and preserve principal. Do whatever you want. You're in good hands. I know. Oh, I have gallery exhibit on Saturday night. Laurie's coming, too. You should bring Michael. I'll text you the details, all right? You work fast for just moving back. Eh, I'm in demand. ♪ Hello now ♪ ♪ Hello now... ♪ I can never figure out what to wear. I really need your help right now, babe. You think that red's too much or that black is too gloomy? I don't know. What are you doing tonight? Ah, team's going out for a late dinner so I'm calling now. Everything okay? Yeah. What're you doing? Um, Kyle invited me and Laurie to his photo exhibit. College reunion, huh? He invited you, too. The firm was thinkin' of doing new corporate headshots. Maybe I should give him a call when I get back. He's an A-list photographer, Michael. Yeah, whatever. And Laurie's pick me up soon, so have fun tonight. You, too. Yeah, red. Can't look away, huh? Mm-mm. Thanks for coming. Hey, strangers. Kyle, I am beyond impressed. You didn't think that about me in college? I only felt that way about me in college. Still does. Laurie, you see that guy over there? - Uh-huh. - He was checkin' you out. So I gave him the elevator pitch. Kyle... I only do elevators on the second date. Oh. You're right. She hasn't changed Where's Michael? He's out of town. Oh, I was looking forward to meetin' him. Next time. He should see your work. You like it? Yeah, it's... arresting. Oh, arresting. I don't really have the words, Kyle. It's... It's so different than anything you did in college. What inspired the style? Kyle! Hi, I am Mary and unfortunately, it's my job to keep this boy in line and make this show pay. I have some serious buyers I need to introduce you to. All right. Okay. - Please excuse us. - Mm-hm. Don't go yet, all right? I know. I am so sorry for keeping you waiting. No. No, no, no. I had no idea it was gonna take that long. - Fine. - But everything's sold. - That's great. Congratulations. - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Let's celebrate. More money for my new wealth manager to move around. Cheers. It's like you took snapshots of people's lives and dreams. And every one's so spontaneous. How'd you do it? Oh, it's complicated. See, I try to establish a relationship with my models as quickly as possible. Strategy I perfected freshmen year. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. No, I just think that... people are more spontaneous when they're comfortable in their surroundings and people they trust. What do you think? I think you have a point there. That's what I remember about your stories actually. What? The spontaneity in your writing. You were just always able to capture this moment... in time. - You remember that? - It's hard to forget. It was also been really hard not being able to talk to you all these years. I-I was just trying to respect what you said. I don't know what I was saying back then. I understood that it was hard on you to talk to me. Look, I know I didn't handle things very well back then. I guess I was just coming to grips with the fact that we were over. But I'm glad we can have a different kind of future now. I'm-I'm really happy you said that, Kyle. To new us. Nice house. Thanks. Speaking of which, we should discuss you investing in some local real estate. I'm a step ahead of you. I already started movin' into a new spot. You sure you really need my advice? Absolutely. Look, um... I know we're just doing business stuff now, but can I ask you a personal question? Okay. What do you remember about us? Um... Everything with us was just... carefree. It-it was unhurried. It was like we had all the time in the world. And I, um... I felt things differently. And I always imagined how you would see things and feel things. Me, too. I am sorry, ahem. - Shouldn't have done that... - No, no, it's... It's not you. So you'll send me the numbers on the new house? Yes. Mm-hmm. I will. Thanks for the ride home. Anytime. Kyle. Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything is fine. I, um, I... I just thought I'd be tired and I'm not. So I was thinking, um... I should come check out that real-estate investment you made. So, I'll work out of here once I get the studio set up. That's good. It's another business write-off. So this gets the Apex Wealth Management seal of approval? - Definitely. - All right. Are you okay? I am fine. Uh... I never... got a chance to tell you that... how much... hurting you upset me. Don't feel guilty. Forget about that. I was to blame, too. Listen to this... It's because of you... that I drop fragments of my emotions wherever I walk. That everywhere I go... and no matter where I am... I feel like it'll always be a part of us. No, see, you are one who has the way with words. No, those are your words... from one of your stories. I can't believe you remember all that. I-I remember everything about you. I think about us. How good it was. Tell me to stop and I will. Don't stop. Kyle? Kyle? Morning. - Good morning. - Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Where'd you go? Oh, I went out to get us breakfast. That's good. I'm starving. Um, you know what, give me a few minutes and I'll come downstairs? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. There she is! Just like that summer when we were in Paris. Except for the cat at the bistro that kept hopping on our table. You remember that? Uh... I don't-I don't know what to say. It's complicated. Because of our past? Yeah, not just our past, but our present, too. Is it 'cause I'm a client now? T-there's that. And your boyfriend? - Duh, yeah. - It's fine. I don't see any conflict of interest in trusting you with my money, and as far as Michael's concerned, well... I should go. Okay. I'll walk you out. I just need time to think. Yeah, I get it. Take your time. But not too long, all right? I never stopped loving you, you know? I saw these roses arrive this morning. Clearly, Michael's got the whole bells and whistles thing down. Yeah, they are somethin'. After you settle, we gotta talk structuring that NBA buyin' opportunity for the Hoffer family. Hey, Ange, your phone's goin' straight to voicemail and I'm back-to-back all day, so, um, I guess I'll have to say this in a message. As crazed as I've been lately, I didn't want you to think that I'd ever forget the anniversary of the first time we met. Karaoke night. Some day in May 2000 and something. I-I still don't remember the date exactly or the lyrics at all. But I do remember that it was the best night of my life. We gotta do it more often. Listen, uh, I have to back in there. I love you. See you soon. ♪ Broken heart and I'm holdin' oh ♪ ♪ 'Cause when love doesn't feel worth the risk ♪ ♪ When you can't find a way to unclench your fist ♪ ♪ When you break under the weight of all you miss ♪ ♪ Remember there'll be better days than this ♪ ♪ There'll be better days ♪ ♪ There'll be better days ♪ ♪ There'll be better days ♪ Okay. I've been thinking about things, and, um... I think the other night... was just... old feelings. You know it was more than that, come on. It was a nice trip down memory lane. Are you serious? You said that you were okay with us having a different kind of future. I want us to be friends. I wanna keep working for you as your wealth manager, but... that's all it can be. Okay. I'm glad you see it that way, too. So, uh, let's try this again. To a new us. You know what, I got a lot of deadlines I need to catch up on. I'mma call it a night. Oh. - Okay. - Another time. I'm... I'm glad we figured this out. Sure. I'll call you soon. Yeah. Michael? Hey. Hey. I thought you're gonna be later. I felt bad, so I caught an earlier flight. And, uh, fever, apparently. - Aww. You're burnin' up. - Mm. Let's get you into bed. I appreciate the offer, but would you believe me if I told you I had a headache? Come on, let's get you upstairs. Yeah, I know it's real short notice, but one of my models didn't show and I need a replacement right now if you can? Yeah, I'll send you over a picture of the look. Thanks. Can I get you anything before we start? I'm good, thanks. So, what did you have in mind? You know my work. Relax, you'll dig it. So... you believe in soulmates? Yeah, totally. Found yours yet? No, but I keep looking. Perfect. Have you found your soulmate? - Oh, yeah. - You're lucky. I am. I want you to read every word of that letter. That's it? That's it? "February 14, 2004. Dear Kyle. Happy Valentine's Day, Sexy." - You stopped. - Isn't this personal? What did I ask you to do? Read every word of this letter. And what the hell is unclear about that? Nothing. Go on, please. "I say the words "I love you" so much that I wonder sometimes if you take for granted the feeling that is behind them. Or maybe there's nothing I can say that can express my feelings for you. Just know, Kyle, that you've touched a place in my heart and made me come alive. Love, Angela." She's the one? She's the one. You want me to read it again? No. Oh, Mr. Miller, you pay my agency and then they pay me my fee. Oh, it's just a little bonus. Oh, thank you so much, but for what? For letting me call you Angela. So, in your mouth or somewhere else? I'm a little too sick for that joke. How was your trip? It was good. Productive. But too long. I missed you. Me too. Let's see. Hm? Your fever's gone down. Must've been a 24-hour thing. Well, lawyers bounce back fast, so... You just take it easy and stay in bed. Call me at work if you need anything. You know, being away this time made me realize that I have everything. Flattery will get you everywhere. Buh-bye. Wanna eat dinner? Yeah. That'd be nice. All right. You've been listening and I like what I'm hearing. Do it all, Angela. Well, you wanted to play it safe at home and take risks abroad. So, we'll remain in U.S. banks and then we'll increase your presence in Asian markets, specifically with the Chinese Yuan denominated bonds. Sounds perfect. Kyle. I was in the neighborhood. Thought I'd stop by and say hey. Eva Romero, Kyle Miller. Kyle is an old friend, and client. We both have excellent taste, Kyle. Angela is the best. I think I recognize you. You're a photographer, aren't you? I read a piece about you in one of the Sunday magazines. You know, I love art. We should discuss adding you to my collection. Call me. I need you to make an appointment before you come into the office, Kyle. What? No exceptions for old friends? Or did I use that up? Listen, I'm available to you as a wealth manager and as a friend. Please tell me that we understand each other. Tsk. Okay. But let me buy you lunch at least. I've been reading about some emerging technology opportunities that I wanted to pick your brain about. I have a lunch. But I would be happy to schedule something with you. She's a good person to know. Okay. Thanks for the introduction. Well, looks like somebody got their appetite back. I got all my appetites back. Oh, yeah? Maybe we should, uh, move on to dessert. Wait. I just wanted to say that I know I get wrapped up in work a lot and it seems like I'm not here for you, but I love what we have and I wish we had more of it. So, I would appreciate it if you wouldn't go anywhere. - Okay? - Okay? 'Cause this is only gonna be a little while longer. And, um, just to make sure... Would you marry me? Yeah! Of course I'll marry you. Do you wanna just go home? - Yeah. I'm done. Yeah. - Let's get out of here. Excuse me, uh, can I get the bill, please? Oh, the gentleman over there already took care of it. - Is that... - Mm-hm. - Hey. - Hey. You must be Michael. It's great to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Oh, all good things, I hope. Mm-hm, of course. Uh, thank you for paying for the food. What's the occasion? Oh, it was obvious. Congratulations, lovebirds. Thanks. - Appreciate it. - Yeah. I don't need to tell you how lucky you are, huh? Uh, we were actually just talkin' about that. You know what? How about I take your engagement photo? As my gift? No. Breakfast was enough. That's, that's fine, thank you. No, I'd love to do it for you, really. No, it's too much. Angela, it's not every day a A-list photographer makes an offer like that. I know, baby, but, um, Kyle's just a very important client. And I don't wanna impose. Listen to the lawyer, Angela. She can be a little stubborn, sometimes, right? I'll call you. Are you okay? Of course. I don't know, you've been a little quiet since breakfast. Maybe I just have whatever you had. You sure that's it? Why don't you tell me what you think is wrong, Michael? Everything was fine until we ran into Kyle. Kyle hasn't changed at all. He's exactly who he's always been. And now, he's a client. I just think I forgot that he can be a bit much sometimes. I mean, he paid for our breakfast, he's taking our engagement photos, so what's the big deal? You don't know him like I do. You told me that his parents died when he was a kid. Well, what I know about psychology, uh, can't really blame the guy for being a little eager to please. Besides... don't we all just need to be needed? You do look a little flush. Phew, oh. You feel hot. What to do? What to do? I think I'm gonna have to do a full examination. Do you think I'm being paranoid about Kyle? Tsk. Mm. Whoo! I mean, it sounds like he's been a good guy and a mensch. Maybe he really did change. Maybe. Anyway, you've more important things to worry about right now. That's true, I have a wedding to plan. I'm talking about the bachelorette party that I'm planning. No. - Please? - No. The last thing I need is a last hurrah, Laurie. Ange, get over yourself. Studies show that the bachelorette party is actually for the bride-to-be's friends. No. So strippers are just definitely out of the question? Yes. Maybe just, like, one stripper for me, just... We could have a relaxing spa day and a nice quiet dinner. That's it. Ugh! - I love you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I love you. - I'll take another. - You look great. - You too. You also look like you're about to get deposed. My ex is taking our engagement photos. Look at it like this, these photos they're gonna capture our love and they'll be genuine works of art. They will. So, um, where are we meeting Kyle? Here. - What? - His idea. He said that we'd be more natural and relaxed in our own home. And that's him. - Are you ready? - You just give me a minute. Okay. Okay. Get in closer. Michael, you're a blinker, man. Every time. Angela, give me a real smile, please. All right. Michael, you asked Angela to marry you. Angela, you said yes. Now, I know it was outside, but come on, let's try and relive the moment, all right? Like you mean it. All right, time out. Michael, you gotta loosen up. Relax, man. Calm down. - Get rid of the jacket. - Okay. Probably burning up in that thing anyway. You don't mind, do you? If he just loses the coat? He's uptight, huh? It's looking good, guys. We're almost there. Wait, wait. Right there, that's the perfect light. Angela, uh, stand next to Michael right there. That's it. Angela, turn around. All right, Michael, put your hands on her waist. Okay, perfect. Now, get your face a little closer to her neck. No, no, um... You guys mind if I demonstrate? We are a shot away from perfect posterity here. Fine by me. All right, all you gotta do is look through the viewfinder. - Here. - Okay. All right. All right. Right, hands over my hands. There you go. You see all the shadows on us right here? Yup. Okay, close your eyes. Please. It'll make the photo. All right? All right, Michael, this is what I'm after, okay? All right, take the shot. All right, great, now re-create that with you two. Good job. I just need a minute. Don't let her take too long, okay? I think we'll just make do with what we have. Michael, I don't just push a button, this is what I do, this is how I work. I appreciate that, but... This is not working out for us. Do you think Angela's gonna accept anything less? We're done here. Done. I'll get you what I got. Thanks for openin' up your home, Michael. You did a great job today. I'll clean this up and post. - I'll be in touch with you? - Yeah. I'll let myself out. You were right. That was a super dumb idea. Yeah. I'm so sorry, by the time I realized what he was doing, it was already done. I should've stopped it. Look, I know that he's your client right now, but I really think you should have another manager take care of him. It's not that easy. He's only a client because of me. Yeah, but not at the cost of making you feel uncomfortable. If anything else happens, I'm gonna sic my lawyer on him. I'll tear him to shreds. Hello, Kyle. You sound upset. You sound like you know why. Look, I didn't mean to rock the boat. And what do you call it? Being an artist. You used to understand what that meant. You gave us a very thoughtful engagement gift, but can we please just leave it at that? It's not that easy. Look... I get it. But I thought that we understood each other. I thought we did too, the other night. In my bed. That's not what I was talking about. Listen, I just wanted you to know that I emailed you the photos. You should look at 'em before Michael does. Oh, that's my agent beepin' through. So, I gotta go. Had a rough day, I'm gonna go for a swim. All right, you go ahead. Just gonna keep drowning in these depo summaries. Michael! Michael, why'd you take my towel? I didn't take your towel. Then how did it get on the bed? Ow! Babe, what is it? Angela, are you okay? Angela? Yeah, baby, I'm, uh... I just pricked my thumb with this safety pin. Could you get me a Band-Aid from the kitchen? Yeah, all right. We need to talk. I'm afraid you'll need to make an appointment with my assistant. I want you to stop. - Stop what? - You know what, Kyle. I want you to stay out of my personal life. And my house. Okay. What about my financial life? As long as you can keep it business, I can move forward. But I don't wanna go through this again. Moving forward, I want you to put more of my money in the high yield ETFs. Well, I would advise against that. We'll agree to disagree on what a newly minted partner is willing to do to keep a healthy book of business. See, sometimes you have to move backwards to move forward. That's from a writer I once knew. Oh, and, unlike your fiancé, I don't blink. Kyle, can I use your charger? Crazy how much you two look alike. I'd like to request that you take over Kyle Miller's account. I no longer feel comfortable working with him. - Are you sure? - Yes. I know this is not easy, but any inappropriate behavior on his part and he is done as a client at the end of this conversation. No, it's-it's nothing like that. I-I'm just trying to get ahead of this. Look, I, I know that this is a big account. And I don't want the firm to lose him. I don't care about that right now. You are my main concern. Look, you have the relationship with his agent, and I think just as long as he and I are not interacting, he'll be fine. You want me to handle the transition talks? That would be great. Thank you. Let's be very quiet now. You always did forget to lock your car door. You used to tell me everything. Do you tell Michael everything? Oh, just so you know, I'm okay with Don handling my account now. You could've told me yourself though. But then again, you always were a... cold, heartless bitch when you were taking your insecurities out on me. I don't need a lens to see that Michael's not right for you. I could feel it. I have nothing more to say to you. Ah, you don't get the last word this time, Angela. See... I can't control now what's going to happen later.

Great. Something not quite right there. You know that guy never sent me the engagement photos? Yeah, that's weird. I gotta go. At last. Here you are. - Hello. - Come in. Thank you. Make yourself at home. I'll get us some champagne. It's beautiful. Great view. This kind of reminds me of my parents' house. Don't tell me I remind you of your mother. No, you do not. Here's to art. To art. So how's Angela doing for you? So far so good. But I'll be the first to admit I'm hard to please. - Hmm. - Are you happy with her? Honestly, there're some losses I'm not too crazy about. - Is that right? - Yeah, junk bonds. She threw me into 'em after I told her I wanted nothing to do with them. I don't like the sound of that. Just check your account statements very carefully. That's all I'm sayin'. I always do. Enough about this business. Follow me. I've been looking forward to this. So have I. I'm always happy to get involved with new clients. And I have walls to fill. I see that. I hope you're patient, Kyle. When it comes to art, I don't make hasty decisions. Oh, I take my time, Eva. With everything. Kyle? I'm just getting some water, babe. Can I get you anything? What the hell are you doing in my office? Relax. I'm waiting for Don to finish a call. Then we're going to go catch a basketball game. It's called client relations. Say what you want to say and let's get this over with. Believe it or not I'm trying to help you. You're hurting me. You're lying, Angela. To yourself. To Michael. We belong together. That's why you couldn't show Michael that one engagement photo I took because one look at that and he will know the truth. I know you didn't. You know a lot about me, Kyle. But you don't know everything. I have a lot of work to do, so please leave. Look at what's happened to you since we've been apart. You turned into this practical, premeditated, predictable shell of yourself. You played it safe and you became everything that you were afraid you'd become. Hell, the only time you actually felt alive all these years was when we made love that night. I felt sorry for you. Save me the pity party abandonment bullshit. You didn't stay with me because my parents killed themselves and you have regret. I asked you to marry me, Angela. You said you needed to know that you'd be able to be happy by yourself and not just with me. Well, how happy are you now? Stop throwing old words at me. Just because you couldn't handle, it isn't my problem. Oh, we'll see who can handle what. And... action. What did you just do? I just let you go. - Hey, baby. - Hi, babe. Ugh, I'm so glad that day is over. Michael? Everything okay? Hope you had a better day than I did. No. What happened? Oh, my God. If I, if I hadn't seen that, would you have told me? I've been trying to find a way to explain, I... It was a yes-or-no question. It's more complicated than that. The world peace is complicated. This is black or white. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I... It didn't mean anything. Don't you see? He's, he's trying to tear us apart. Well, it worked. You can stay here as long as you want. - Thanks. - Relationship advice sucked. No, I did it to myself. I can't believe Kyle is so unhinged. I mean, I know he was a little possessive in college sometimes, but nothing like this. Look, once Michael cools off, you two can work this out. I really would like that, but I don't know. What did I do, Laurie? Hi, Don. I need you in the conference room. Be right there. Don, I need a full explanation of what's happening. Hi, Eva. Angela. What's going on? You tell us. This isn't right. You had power of attorney. If you didn't take the money and I didn't take it, then where is it? I don't know. All I know is that it's not where it's supposed to be. Eva... Don, there has to be some sort of logical explanation for this. Well, until we know what it is, I'm gonna have to put you on suspended leave. Mike will escort you out. Are you happy now? Is this the payback you've been waiting for? Look, Ange, you're overreacting, okay? This is not what you think it is. What am I supposed to think? You ruined my life. - I saved you. - How do you figure that? Because I know you better than anybody else. You always used to beat yourself up 'cause you didn't follow up on your dreams. Well, now you can. You're free of your job. You're free of Michael. My job? How do you know about that? - Are you listening to me? - Yeah, I'm listening. I've literally traveled the world searching for another you, but I can't find one. You really can't let me go, can you? I'm not gonna lose you again, Angela, stop fighting it. I'm sorry. You know how I get when I'm in limbo. Yeah. Of course I do. This is all just happening so fast, Kyle. I need a little space. Some time to think. Okay. Yeah. That's my girl. Always thinking. That's me. All right, I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. You sure about this, Ange? Kyle hacked into my life. I'm gonna hack into his. Well, I'm not sure about this. Since when have you ever said no to anything? Since hacking into Apex's computer system is totally illegal. I thought you said you could get in and out without a trace. Now you're using my past against me. Kyle is using my past against me, Laurie. I'm not gonna get him out of my life until I use something against him. All's fair in love and war, I guess. God. There's no love lost here. Laurie... I think I found something. "Richard Miller death, 1997. Died in double suicide. Deadly cocktail of medication. Financial woes caused millionaire to hide assets." Hm. "Obituary, Katherine Miller. Devoted wife of Richard." Uh, it was only a year before It's really fast that he remarried. Hey, you. Uh, I've been thinking about things. And? We have a lot to talk about. Yeah, yeah. Whatever it takes. Um, I'm staying at Laurie's. Could you come here? Yeah. You won't regret this, Angela. I know. Uh, rise and shine. You can go now. You were right. I wasn't being honest with myself about you. But I wanna know that I can trust you again. Look, I know I did a lot of things that crossed the line. You broke into my house, and my car, and you left the dead roses. You filmed our night together without me knowing and then you sent it to Michael. Then there's... Yeah, I... Look. I went scorched-earth. I'm sorry. All right? It's just that I would literally do anything to get you back. I don't want there to be any suspicions or secrets with us, Kyle. Okay. Okay? Yes. Tell me about your parents. Well, I-I didn't come here to talk about my past. The past is what got us here. Do you wanna salvage this relationship or not? Yes, but you already know what happened to them. I know some of it. You didn't tell me that Megan was your dad's second wife. That your mother died of cancer and he married Megan really soon after that. That had to be kind of weird. I was 12. All right? I don't really remember. She was just... a trophy wife. That's all. Why'd you think your parents killed themselves, especially if your dad was about to close some big real estate deal? I don't know, I heard he was staring down a lot of debt. Maybe the pressure got to him. And he blinked. But he had plenty of life insurance and a trust fund set up for you. My old man didn't talk to me about me. Okay? Let alone his finances. What are you doing, Angela? Trust-building, Kyle. The autopsy report said that your parents overdosed on some sort of medication. Oh, I'm glad your writer's imagination is coming back to you. But I wasn't a suspect. I was a victim. But you found the bodies? You're gonna spill it. Mm. Naughty. Oh, my God. - Stop, Richard. - What? No. No, wait. Wait, stop. What are you doing? - Please, Kyle. - Shut up. Did you finish your drinks? Yeah. I found the bodies. But I was a victim. Not a suspect. Let's talk about your guardian. I Googled him, too. And he was declared a missing person right around the same time that it was found out that he was stealing from your trust fund. Which is right when you left for college. Yeah, well, that's what happens to people who don't wanna face their past. I'm your past, Kyle! But you're not going anywhere. You stole Eva's money, didn't you? Why would I do that? I've got money. I know the time and date the money was transferred out of her account from her computer and I know which offshore trust account it was transferred into. You can't prove that. Yes, she can. Well, I mean, I can. Or did you forget what I did in college? Why are you doing all this, Ange? Huh? Why the hell are you doing this? I did this for you! So that I can be free of you. You can't do this to me again. Don't even think about it. Don't. Uh-huh. Okay. Wait, you're letting him go? Yeah. Well, if you're gonna let that crazy bastard out there, you're gonna need this more than I do. Mm. Once the DA's office hears this, maybe his past will finally catch up with him. I wasn't being honest with myself about you. But I need to know that I can trust you again. You didn't ask for the ring back, or the house keys. So I... I was just hoping that maybe there's the chance that we could pick up where we left off. Unless helping me with the DA's all you're willing to do. I'm willing to do more. We have a lot to work through, Angela. I know. I don't mind starting over. How do we do that? It's karaoke night at a bar I know. Oh, we don't have to take it back that far. Plus, I have, um, motion I have to argue, so I have to save the golden voice, you know? Yeah. We could just, we could just start with today? I can do that. We could pick up dinner. Yeah. Sounds good. Hey, Ange. Hey, honey. Angela was a hell of a writer. You ever read anything of hers that wasn't a grocery list... or a quarterly report or... X's and O's scribbled on some stupid generic greeting card? Hmm? I asked you a question, counselor. - No. - No. You missed out. See, Michael, that's the best thing about first loves. You get the best version of that person before life dulls them down and snuffs out the spark. Listen to this. Listen to this, Michael. "When I think about us I start thinking in these narrow tunnels, these tunnels that block everything else out except you and me. Nothing else seems to matter. And that scares me because of how strong the feeling is." That's from the heart. Words from the heart. Not about you. Say it! Say it. "From the heart." Say it! From the heart. You didn't mean that. - Say it! - From the heart. Oh, hey, um, yeah. Here. You read the next one. Read! "I always wanted to be with you. And now when we're apart, I... I hate feeling this way, so much long-range plans..." Stop, right there. You hear what you just said? Long range plans, Mikey boy. Consider yourself completely X-ed out of those. You're not gonna get away with this. I won't? We'll see. I always do. Keep reading. Go on. "You're a beautiful person to come home to. I can see myself being so amazingly happy and, and, and content if we both have our jobs or school or whatever, ever in the end of the day it'll all be over and, and you will be there and it would be like... having everything." Now, does that sound like somebody who doesn't want to spend the rest of their life with me? I've changed. Step away from Michael. You've changed? You won't. Just stop it, Kyle. No! What we had it's still real, Angela. I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life wondering, "What if?" If I can't have you, neither can he. Are you okay? Oh, my God. I'll kill you. Baby? Baby, are you okay? Oh, my... Baby, are you all right? Michael, I am so sorry. Well, that was a great read. But you know, I'm actually a, a little taller, a bit cooler and way hotter than Pamela's boyfriend. Baby, it's a work of fiction. Any resemblance to persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental. Who's your lawyer? Some awesome solo practitioner dude. Ooh, this might be a settlement offer. - Uh, do you mind? Okay. - No. Go, baby. Excuse me. You're Angela Pierce, right? Uh, yeah. I am. Could you please sign this for me? It's for my mom. She's a fan. Oh, of course. Do you need a pen? Yeah, I do. Uh, what's your mom's name? Janice. That's a pretty name. She's a pretty lady. I, I think she kinda looks like you. That's very sweet of you to say. Thank you, Ms. Pierce. Don't. Please, Kyle. Shut up!
