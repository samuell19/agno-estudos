[light music] [dramatic music] [phone buzzing] [music continues] [phone ringing] [Cassy] Soto Health, this is Cassy. Hi, Claire. Yeah, he's drinking tons and tons of water. I'm making sure of it. No, yeah, don't worry about it. Yeah, I'll totally... I got it, I'll check on him. Yeah. For sure. Okay, bye. - Hi, Dom. Happy holidays. - Cassy. Hey, I know I'm 15 minutes early, but it's kind of important, so if he isn't doing anything, I'd rather not wait and get straight to it. - Okay, let me check in with him. - [upbeat music on radio] Dom's here, he says it's important. If you're available now, should I send him in? [groans lightly] Uh, just have him wait. It's not quite time yet. [grunts] Yeah, thank you, Cassy. [music continues] - Does he make you wear that hat? - Why? 'Cause I can't share the holiday spirit of my own volition? No, no. Just seemed like one of those Jorge things. Well, I'll have you know it was a joint decision. This year's theme is inclusion. We wanna make sure no one's left out. Chinese, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, everyone's holiday is as worthy of attention as Christmas. - What about Kwanzaa? - Who? [phone rings] Soto Health, this is... Fuck off, Andrew! - I told you not to call me at work. - [phone slams] My creeper ex. I only went out with him because he's like 12 feet tall, so I figured he'd have a 12-inch dick, but turns out proportions don't work that way. And he has a crazy Korean fetish. Memorized lyrics to all these K-pop songs I don't even know, watches all the dramas. He even tried buying me a Korean school girl outfit. Can you imagine me in a school girl uniform? - I can only imagine. - Anyway, I like it. Keeps my head warm. Besides, it adds to the overall cheer. Is he actually doing something or is he just sitting in there? You've known him the longest, you tell me. [phone rings] Soto Health, this is Cassy. Hi, Ms. Rottenstein, how can I help you? Sure. Okay, Monday. [music continues] [phone rings] - [Rita] Mayeda Realtors, this is Rita. - Hey, it's me. - Dom, where the hell did you go? I had Darius Ebner in here expecting to be shown the Rowley house, but surprise, you're not here. - Also, isn't this the house that Jorge wants? - Shit. [clicks tongue] I'll call him later, can you reschedule him? I already did to tomorrow, 'cause you'll be here in the office tomorrow. Why can't you leave a note? Or use the spoken word? "Hey, Rita, I'm leaving." No, you can't. - You have an appointment! - Okay, I'm sorry. Look, uh, I'll leave a note next time. Look, if Lisa calls looking for me, can you tell her... Lisa's already called looking for you. I told her I don't know where you are because I don't know where you are. Well, if she calls again, just tell her I'm meeting a client. - Which client? - Uh, a new one. Thank you for making my job harder by not telling me anything - and making me lie to your wife. - Rita, please, can you... I'm dealing with something right now, okay? Thank you. [phone beeps] [panting] Trust me, proportions don't work like that. You remember how tall Andrew was? Well, "disappointed" isn't even the right word. Wait, let me put you on hold. Yes? Will do. Dom? Dom? Dominic, the highlight of my week. - You were just sitting there, weren't you?! - Oh, come on. Jorge, I really need your advice and you made me sit outside for 15 minutes, looking at a book of nude women with scars! Hey, what do you think of it? I had to drive through a mile of smoke to get here! Okay, don't yell at me, I didn't start the fire. Would you sit down already? Arguing is not good for your mental and physical health. What did I tell you about that? Why do you have that anyway? - What? - The scars book. Oh, that's... Claire's getting lipo for her birthday, so she thought it would help prepare me, you know, in case of any scarring. Isn't that dangerous? I thought the mortality rate was absurdly high, - like one in 5,000 or something? - Oh, no, that was the '90s lipo. Besides, I made sure she's going to the best surgeons in the country. You know, I could not live without her. - Right, that's why you divorced her. - Hmm. Symbolically. But we never went through the paperwork. But you know what? She's a totally different person ever since we got back together. I'm talking about going from Roman Catholic, uptight, and super jealous of any woman near me to doing witchcraft and be so trusting. She's the one who actually introduced me with Cassy, you know? Hey, by the way, when can we tour that Rowley house? Claire really wants the house, you know? Yeah, yeah. Listen, these pills you gave me, they don't calm me down, - they just make me tired as shit. - Hey, don't take one, then. - [drawer opens] - Come on, here. These are uppers, these will cancel out the downer you just took. - Do you have any water? - No. Um, just take it dry, feels better. Yeah. Oh, and these. These, my friend, are the new Prozac in town. - What are they? - Oh, they're called fen-phen. They makes you alert, gives you dopamine. - Are they safe to mix? What are the other ones? - Oh, come on, Dom. I'm not gonna give you anything I won't take myself. Hmm? See? Just take it. There you go. [exhales] Wow. So what's new in real estate? I've been having dreams. - What kind of dreams? - So I'm in the middle of the country somewhere, I drive up to an auto repair shop, which is a combination of Costco gas station lines and driveways that lead up to an auto garage, and there was the worker, the guy at that one Jiffy Lube that rips you off. - [chuckles] Yeah, all Jiffy Lubes rip you off. - I know, those fuckers. Anyway, I left and went to go to my car. It was gone. I go to the manager's office and my car had been towed. There in the tow section, I clicked my car remote for my car to honk so I could locate it and I found it was crushed between two other vehicles. - And how did that make you feel? - I was devastated. I felt so helpless. So then the guy from Pert London shows up, somehow he works there too, and then I beg him to release my car because I have no money to pay for it, and I'm in the middle of nowhere. But instead of empathizing with me, - they start making fun of me for being Caribbean. - What do you mean? Like, making racist Jamaican jokes and stuff. - But you're not Jamaican. - I know, but in the dream I was, and I was really offended by their remarks. Anyway, that part might not really be relevant. I'm just telling you because... The relevance of dreams isn't so much in the details as in the emotions and reactions to them. - See, because the subconscious emotions... - [phone buzzing] ...can be the manifestations of real life concerns - that you might be experiencing. - It's Rita, I'll just... Hey, you know what to do, put her on the speaker phone. - Seriously? - Yeah, no secrets here. This space is only for truth. - Rita? - Lisa called again, I told her what you said to tell her and she said to let you know she's on her way to Burbank Airport and to call her back. - O-kay. - Dom, what's going on? - Why are you avoiding your wife? - Thank you. - Dom, you have... - [phone beeps] Dom, why are you not talking to Lisa? Let me tell you something, the road to hell is paved with ignoring your wife. I mean, Claire always calls Cassy. But if she called myself, I would not dare not to pick it up. Yeah, well, I'll get to that. In my second dream, I'm being chased through the city by a Hispanic couple, man and a woman. Hispanic or Latino? I don't know the difference. Well, today, Hispanic generally refers to anyone of Spanish speaking origin, including Spain. But some people say it doesn't include Brazil since they speak Portuguese. But they count as Latino, so. This is... for some people, this is a matter of preference, you know? Me, can be Latino, Hispanic, doesn't matter. - I don't think they were Brazilian. - Okay. Anyway, in my dream I have the power to warp through walls by crashing into them and entering a void space where they can't see me but I can see through the walls to them. [dramatic music] - And I can also fly, though very slowly. I move a few feet with each flap of my arms, and at the mercy of the wind. I know the couple wanted me in connection to something, but I don't remember what it is. I know only the feeling of narrowly escaping them, floating just out their reach from the window of a high rise, watching them watching me as I escape through the air, over the wide ocean between us. And then I wake up. Okay, so how does this relate to you not talking to Lisa? You don't see it? This is the Pert London deal. My car represents the company they're taking away from me. And the whole laughing at me for being Jamaican is them laughing at a foreigner, AKA the British laughing at me because they know I'm being played. - Ah. - The Hispanic woman is Lisa! Trevor, one of the Pert London partner, is Hispanic! - Come on. - I wasn't paying attention to the signs when I was awake, but in here, subconsciously, I'm picking it up. Lisa being Hispanified means she's leaving me for Trevor, the Hispanic Pert London guy. I can't go through with this deal now! Dom, that's not how dreams work. What do you mean? You said it yourself, they're the subconscious manifestations of real-life concerns. Yeah, but emotions of real-life concerns doesn't mean they're evidence of anything. And I said, "Sometimes." Sometimes doesn't mean anything at all. So you think my brain's giving me these scenarios at random? The fact that Pert London is in both of them is random? The Hispanic guy chasing me and Trevor from Pert London just happening to be Hispanic is meaningless too? - You think this is just coincidental bullshit? - I don't know, Dom! I only took psychology one semester in college. I'm a goddamn accountant, remember? Look, you're welcome to come here anytime you want and talk things through. But if you're having some serious doubts about your marriage, then you need to go see a professional. Why don't you and Lisa go see a marriage counselor, huh? Someone specially trained to help you through whatever you are going through in life. It's too late. She's about to be on a plane to London. - Well, do it after that trip. - I don't think she's coming back. Oh, keep ignoring her phone calls and you might be right. [inhales, sighs] A month ago, we had a sit down with Pert London. [dramatic music] - It was me, Lisa, and their two partners, including Trevor. Lisa bought coffee for everyone... and when she gave Trevor his... I saw a look between them. Oh, yeah? And did her eyes pop out like Bugs Bunny and stretch to his penis? Hey, I have a photographic memory. I know what I saw, okay? There's a difference between looking and "looooking." Yeah, okay, you said it longer the second time. Okay, so you have photographic memory, right? What's the prescription number on this bottle? 77835196-B. Correct. But you didn't notice that it doesn't say my name. It says Kate. - Who's that? - That's not the point. The point is that you might have perfect memory, but you only seeing the details that you wanna see. See? And that's distorting the bigger picture. Let me ask you something, has Lisa given you any actual indications that she was unhappy with her marriage? Or this is just because of a look or your silly dream about her being Hispanic? Yes, Lisa's been distant lately. I don't remember the last time she said "I love you" on the phone. Well, do you say that to her? There's one more thing... I get real-time alerts on all our credit cards for any charges over $50. Look at the most recent one. Seventy-seven dollars, Wendy's. Fuck, for how many people? No, no, no. The one above it. Oh, 366, KKO Airways. That's a one-way ticket price. Well, people buy one-way tickets all the time, just to be safe. Besides, don't you both have family in London? I mean, it makes sense, she wants to set extra time to see them, right? No, that might not be anything out of the ordinary by itself, but add on everything else I just told you? I need to talk to your friend before I lose my company along with Lisa. - The divorce lawyer, Rodan or something? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You are not divorcing your wife over premonitions, dreams, or looks. I don't care how stretched out you say that word. We're gonna set you up with a marriage counselor right now - because you are not thinking straight. - [phone buzzing] And when Lisa comes back from London, which she will... [buzzing continues] - You're picking that up right now. - I can't. No, wait! - [grunting] - [buzzing continues] [touch tone clicks] You've reached Dominic Mayeda, please leave a message. [Lisa] Dom, it's me. I'm at the airport and I've just found that my binder with all the Pert London documents is not in my suitcase. Check my desk. They don't take facsimile, so you'll have to mail it to the PLP's office. I'll be at my parents' tomorrow and then with Pert the day after, so it needs to be mailed Next Day Air today to get there on time, okay? - Bye. - [phone beeps] What the hell is wrong with you? I took it out of the suitcase. - What? - The binder with the document. I took it out last night while she was asleep. Oh, my God. I know what this is. - Jorge, if I'm right about this, then... - This is a mid-life crisis. - What? No, it's not. - Yes. Trust me, I've been through this too. That's one of the reasons I separated from Claire. Love always changes over time. It's either growing or dying, there's no in between. But you know what I learned since I got back together with her? You get a say in that! Love isn't always about not being able to live without someone. Sometimes it's choosing not to live without them, even when you can. Huh, that almost sounds wise. You like the second part? A Jehovah's Witness said it to me over the weekend. Same guy tried to get me to invite him inside for three years. Este cabron never gives up. Damn. All right, so now we gotta go. All right, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. - What are you doing? - Up, up, up. Put your shoes on. Shoes on. You gotta go home, get the binder, mail it before the post office closes. - Jorge? - Yes. Cassy, can you give Dom a candy cane for the road? - I don't want a candy cane. - Okay, um, the fire's moved west, so they just closed down the five in both directions, so there's no way to get south. - So all your appointments are canceled. - [speaking in Spanish] [in English] Hey, can you check if the fire's near Rowley and Balboa? There's a house there that Claire and I were... Oh, God. It's too late. What have I done? [woman] Excuse me. Can I see a doctor, please? I've been walking and I think I breathed in smoke. [coughs] I can't stop coughing. [Cassy] Oh, this is an accounting office, ma'am, there's no doctor here. I don't understand, it says Health Clinic outside. No, it says Accounting Clinic, ma'am. As in financial health if you need a money doctor. Otherwise, you need a real doctor. I got sick last year, and now I got pneumonia, - and I've just got very... - Cassy. It's over. I can't return the binder now even if I wanted to. The deal's gonna fall through after everything we worked for, and now Lisa's definitely gonna divorce me. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen to me, buddy. It's not too late, okay? Yes, it is. The highway's closed. The post office will close. You know I started this company before we were married. - It was just me and a computer. - I know. I know. I need to prepare my divorce options, Jorge. Let me at least keep my company. Let me talk to Rudoy. - No, no, no... - Let me talk to her! Ay! [grunting] [eerie music] Puta madre! Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm gonna call her right now and she's gonna calm you down. - Okay? - What the hell was that? - Did you see that? - Ah, it's just cramps. It happens. Here. Take one, too, it's gonna calm your nerves. Anyways, she's seen it all. She knows what a real failed marriage looks like and she's gonna tell you it's all your nerves because this is what it is. It's all nerves. I mean, your company being bought. [dial tone] - You know, Lisa going away on a trip, these goddamn fires. Ashes everywhere. I mean, how can you not be anxious? [line ringing] [Mel's voicemail] You have reached Melanie Rudoy. - Leave a message or I will never, ever return your call. - [beeps] Hey, Mel, it's Jorge. Can you call me back at the office please? It's important, okay? Bye. Jorge, are you sure those pills are safe to mix? - Look at me, I'm sweating. - It's fine, it's just the stress. Here. I'm sweating too. [Jorge sighs] - [phone rings] - Hello? [Mel] Jorge, hello. Hey, I got 15 minutes before my next meeting, just so you know. Yeah, that's no problem, uh, I'll be quick. Listen, I got you on the speaker phone with my buddy, Dominic, and he's a little worried, you know, about his wife and, you know, I mean how she's going away on a business trip without him. - Uh-huh. - So it's all nerves, you know? But I think that it will make him feel better if someone with your expertise can give him some perspective because you know when there's real trouble. Of course, of course. He's there right now? Yeah, he can hear you, go ahead, Dom. - Hi, this is Dominic. - Hello, Dominic. This is Melanie Rudoy. You can call me Mel or Rudoy, but not easy. [laughing] So you are worried your wife is going to cheat on you during this business trip, is that correct? Well, the thing is I saw a look between... Forget the fucking look! Look, long story short, he and his wife are selling their real estate company to a bigger one in London, so she's flying there to close the deal, but he thinks that she's gonna be leaving him for a guy at the London office because they don't say "I love you" on the phone anymore. And she hasn't bought her return ticket yet. - Well, it's a little more... - You don't say "I love you" on the phone to each other? Not for a while now. Because we work together and when we started getting more business... Well, you know, that happens to couples sometimes. You just get busy and you start to overlook little things like that. I don't think it means your relationship is dead or anything. You should just try saying it to her next time you talk on the phone and maybe she'll start saying it again. That's exactly what I told him. See, didn't I tell you that? Also, people buy one-way tickets all the time for this type of things. Let me ask you, though, why aren't you going with your wife? - What is her name? - Lisa. Okay, Lisa. Why aren't you going with Lisa to do this deal if you don't like that she's traveling by herself? I can't, I don't do well on planes. - Why? You get sick or something? - No, I just... [Jorge] It's just a phobia, you know? I mean, I know a guy who's afraid of hot dogs because they look very much like penises to him. [chuckles] [chuckles] Oh, so like a homophobia, huh? No, I'm not homophobic. It's just planes. Uh... [scoffs] I'm kidding. [laughing] So basically, you don't trust Lisa? Well, it's not that I don't trust her, it's just, I feel like a... It's just, this is what I'm telling him, Mel, it's all feelings, nerves. She hasn't actually done anything to be suspicious, it's all in his head. Look, it's not about her doing something. She's cheating or not cheating, if he's not sure, that's a problem that you can't just think away. He has to be sure. Simple. - So when is her trip? - Oh, she's already at the airport. Okay. And you dropped her off? - I didn't. - Why not? Oh, I mean I offered, but she just said she would just take a cab. Well, that's suspicious. - It is? - [Jorge] What do you mean? What's suspicious about that, Mel? It's so he could be at the office. Hey, look, you called me. I drive my husband to the airport and he drives me. I would be suspicious if he refused. Sometimes people don't want to be driven because they don't want their spouses to find out they're meeting someone else or going somewhere else they don't say they're going. Things like that. - You think so? - [Jorge] Oh, hold on. Let's not jump in to any conclusions here. No, we don't jump to anything. We just make sure, simple. I have to go, but I'll give you the number of someone that can make sure for you. He's retired now, but he was a great PI back in the day when I worked with him. Just tell him I sent you his way and he will give you a good rate, okay? - You have a pen? - Wait, you mean go to the airport? Hold on, I don't know if that's really necessary. [Mel yelling in Russian] [in English] I decide when it's time for him to come in. Look, Jorge, I'll text the number to you, I have a client. - Wait, wait, Mel... - Also, Dominic, don't use your cell phone to call him. We don't want Lisa to see the call on the phone bill, okay? - Good luck. - Okay. [phone hangs up] [phone buzzes] Great, now we have the phone number of a guy we can send over to spy Lisa at the airport. Fucking unbelievable. - We have to do it. - Are you fucking kidding me, Dom? I mean, hiring a guy to spy on your wife is something you do if you find, like, love letters or, uh, credit cards in a motel you've never been to. Not because fucking silly dreams about flying - or being Jamaican or whatever. - It's not just the dreams. - It was a fucking look! - Okay, don't yell at me! I'm trying to help you out. - You don't even know how much this guy costs. - I know. Look, maybe I'm having a mid-life crisis. Maybe it's just stress and it's all in my mind. But Melanie's right, it's not gonna go away if I just stop thinking about it. The simplest thing is to do is to find out. If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. [tense music] [line ringing] Make sure you ask how much he charges first, okay? [ringing continues] [man on phone] Hey-lo! Hi, is this, uh... I'm sorry, we didn't get your name. I'm Jorge and this is Dominic. Um... We're friends of Mel Rudoy. She gave us your phone number. Aw, Mel? Definitely had some exciting times working with her. Well, you got the right number. I'm Charlie, my friends call me Chuck, or Chucky, or Chuck-a-latte. [laughing] Nah, I'm just joking. So, uh, hey, how can I help you gentlemen? Well, it's kind of a time sensitive matter. - Hold on, how time sensitive? - Uh... Can you get to Burbank Airport in like 30 minutes or so? Oh, extremely fucking time sensitive. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna grab some stuff, get in the car, I'm gonna call you back as soon as I get on the road, and you guys can shoot all the details onto me. - [Dom] Okay, sure. - All right, Jorge, you said, right? And Dom. Dominic, Dom. All right, Dominic or Dom, talk soon. [phone clicks] Okay, we're doing it. You didn't even ask how much he charges. It will be a good rate, you heard Mel. Fine. Fine. Fine. If that makes you feel better, then hey. You know what? I do feel better. I think maybe I just needed to do something about it. - You know? - Hey, speaking of doing something, you better call somebody right now - and get the binder from your place. - Oh, shit. Wait, shouldn't we wait for Charlie? I mean, I'm not saying he's gonna find anything, but... We'll wait actually for him to mail it, but at least have it ready. Right. I think I know. What are you doing? You cannot use your phone. - Why not? - You heard Mel. What about if Lisa asks you if she sees the phone number - on the phone bill? - I'm calling my cousin. What's it matter if she sees that number? I don't know, Dom. What about if she ask about it? You couldn't call her because you were meeting a client, but you calling your cousin instead? I don't know, Dom, it's... it's up to you. [buttons clicking] [line ringing] - [Frances on phone] Hello? - Frances. Hey, it's Dom. Dom? Where are you calling from? - I don't have this number. - It's an office line. Hey, you're not busy, are you? I need kind of a big favor. - Depends on what the favor is. - Okay, so Lisa left a binder at home that contains very important documents that I need you fetch and possibly mail. - Right now? - Yes, before the post office closes. - It needs to get to London before a meeting. - [Frances sighs] I can't, I'm going out tonight. Your place is 40 minutes from me. W-Why can't you do it yourself? Where... Where are you? It's not 40 to my place, it's 15 max. Yeah, it is, with rush hour and all the fires around town, it's 40 minimum, mate. What about Rita, who gets paid to do work for ya? I can't. Look, you're the only person I can trust with this right now. Everyone else is gone for the holidays. Exactly, Dom, it's the holidays. Once a year, I get to go to parties I actually enjoy. You know I love ya, but I'm not missing it for your wife. - This isn't just Lisa... - I don't understand... It might be Charlie on the other line. ...she's actually getting paid to do this kind of shit... Sorry, let me call you right back. - Hello? - [Cassy] Claire says to make sure you're drinking water. And are you expecting a call from a Chuckzilla? Uh, yes and yes. Put him through. - [Charlie] Uh, yeah, Dom? - Yes, and Jorge. - That was Jorge, this is Dom. - All right, Dom and Jorge. Listen, I should be there in less than 15. Lay it all over me. I need to find out if my wife is... I don't... If she's even there, I guess. I didn't drive her to the airport. Wait, is she supposed to be getting there or is she already inside the gate? Inside the gate. She likes to be at the boarding door early. Okay, I'll have to buy a ticket. Which flight is it? Uh, one second. KKO, flight 226. Stops over in San Francisco before London. - You can return it, right? - I don't know, I'm just gonna get the cheapest thing I can get just to get in the gate. - Unless you want me to board the plane? - No, no, no, no, no. You don't need to board the plane. [whispers] He doesn't need to board that plane. Yeah, you don't have to board. Just find out if she's actually there, or with anyone, or anything like that. Okay, send me a text with her photo and a description of her clothing. I'm gonna hang up and buy a ticket right now so I can beeline through security. [phone clicks] - Give me his number. - What are you doing? I'm sending him a picture of Lisa. What? You cannot use your phone. Well, I can't send a picture through this fucking thing. Yeah, well, you can email it, right? - Do you have his email? - No. Then give me his fucking number! It's one text! I'm not the one being suspected of cheating here. I'm just thinking ahead, okay? Here. You know, if Lisa isn't cheating, then spying on her like this is as bad as cheating yourself. You know? - No, it isn't. I'd be flattered if I found out Lisa was stalking me, or at least paying someone to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But the problem with suspicion is that the moment you act on them, doesn't matter what the outcome is, trust is already damaged, the relationship is just no longer the same. - Hey, your cousin. - Right. [buttons clicking] [line ringing] [Frances] Dom, I told ya, I'm sorry, but I just... - Wait, let me claim this favor coupon. - A what coupon? The favor coupon you gave me when I saw you in London for one favor. I have it right here. What the hell are you...? Oh, my God, you mean the "forgive me" coupon? - Huh. - Bloody hell, I gave that to you when I was like six. - Why do you still have it? - I don't know, I get sentimental about stuff I have in my wallet for a long time. - Anyway, I'm cashing it in, so... - First off, if I didn't emphasize it enough the first time, I gave that to you when I was six. Second, even if I chose to honor that thing, it's a "forgive me" coupon. So I'll forgive you for attempting something so stupid. Yeah, I'll give you one in return. You can use it for any favor you want. Frances, please, I'm begging you! - Hello? - I want five favor coupons. Five? - Is that a yes or a no? - All right, yes. Fuck's sake, fine, I'll give you a call when I get to your place. [whispers] Yes. Thank you. You owe me so much after this. I'm going to miss a Christmas raffle with actual good prizes this year. Come on, you never win those. At least I saved you wasting your money on it. I've already bought the bloody ticket! You know what? I want 10 favor coupons. - Wait, we already agreed! - Ten! - [phone clicks] - Oh, fuck. - God fucking damn it! - [drums playing] - What the... fuck did you give me?! - Calm down! - Calm down! Hey! - Why do you have so many pills?! Calm the hell down! Calm... calm down! Calm down! [yelling] [screaming] What the fuck is wrong with you? Jorge? Jorge, what the fuck?! Is that the drugs? Is that gonna happen to me? It's nothing, trust me, it's just stress. - [panting] - [phone buzzing] Hey, it's Mel. - [dial tone] - [buttons clicking] [line ringing] - [Mel] I just called your cell. - Call my office number, not my cell. Why not? Is Claire going to be jealous? [laughs] No, she trusts me completely, okay? Those calls goes through Cassy, that's how we do things. Okay, okay, I'm just clutching your balls. Did you call Charlie? Is Dom still there with you? [Jorge] Dom? - Hello? - Hello, Dom, did you call Charlie? Yeah, he's on his way to the airport right now. Good. Hey, how much does this guy charge anyway? Depends on the job, but he'll give you a good rate, don't worry. [Jorge] What the hell is a good rate? I mean, we didn't even sign any forms before he took it on. - Jorge, it'll be fine. - Okay, I'm just saying, I know he's your guy and all, but we're not paying if it's unreasonable. Eh, come on, it'll be reasonable. Just don't jilt him, he's going to end up hiring me to sue you both. [laughs] I'm kidding, I only do divorces. - Let me know how it goes. - Okay. [tense music] [muffled] Are you sure you don't want half of this? [sighs] Claire makes the best corned beef sandwiches. Hey, you trust her right? Mel? She knows what she's talking about. She's a character, though. Hey, you'll never guess how I met her. - Well, guess. - I don't fucking know. On a cruise? At the BDSM club. [chuckles] You mean like whips and people having sex all tied up? No, no, no, no, no. They were not having sex. It's just the theme of the club, you know? Like costumed dancing. There were some people having sex there too. - She's into that, huh? - Yeah, I know. Yeah. - What were you doing there? - Claire. - I told you, a completely different woman. - What happened? I mean, you said she's like a witch or something? Well, I think deep down inside there is magic in all of us. You know, maybe we are like witches to some extent. But you know what I think? I think that you and Lisa just need something new in your relationship. You ever talk about having kids? We've had the kids talk already. Okay, well if you're not having kids, then you should spice things up in the bedroom. You know? Ah, here. This is the place. I promise you it's fucking fantastic. I don't know, Lisa's not like that. Like what? Into sex? - You're always telling me she's a smart one. - So? So it's very well documented that the more intelligent the person is, the more pervert they are. Huh, yeah! Bill Gates? The biggest pervert. - I know it. - What? I mean, just look at Japan. One of the most advanced nations in the world, so far ahead of United States in terms of technology and societal efficiency. Have you seen a Japanese porn? I mean, I've... [laughing] It's crazy. Things you'll never dream of. Oh, my God, okay, they have one where they have this scientist there, right? And he builds this device to stop time so he can use it at a superhero yoga class. So... [laughing] Are you kidding me? Superhero yoga class? Oh, my. [laughs] America have no imagination in comparison. For you guys, it's all like penis and vagina, penis and vagina. Oh, I mean, I can't even get a hard-on seeing a vagina anymore. For me, it's just like, oh, looking at someone's armpit. [phone ringing] - Hello? - [Cassy] I have Chuck-E-Cheeses on the line. - Ah? - That Kentucky guy that called earlier. Oh, is he really from Kentucky? - I don't know. - Yes, put him through. - [Charlie] Hey, Dom and Jorge. - Charlie, did you find her? Based on the photos you sent me, I'm 95% sure that I'm eyeballing her right now. Okay, so she definitely wasn't lying about the flight. Yeah, she's sitting next to a guy in a suit right now. [tense music] - Is he Hispanic?! - Not sure, could be Chicano, but I ain't racist, so I can't really say. Send us a picture! [sirens blare in distance] [gentle music] [in Korean] [gasps] [gentle music] [muffled music over headphones] [phone ringing] [in English] Soto Health, this is Ca... I swear to God, Andrew, it's over. I hope this brush fire moves in your direction and burns down only your house with you inside. Afternoon, miss. Are you here on a real official police business or is this just an excuse to see me? Real police business, but, um, when are you gonna let me take you out? How tall are you? [shouting] Hold on one second. Hold on one second. Are you sure this is him? I don't care! Get on the fucking plane, Charlie! - [Charlie] Okay, listen... - [knocking on door] One sec. Yes? Sorry to interrupt, the police just came by to tell us they're doing voluntary evacuations in this area. Nah, that's just for old people. Tell us if it becomes mandatory. Okay, will do. Have you been drinking water? [door closes] All right, Charlie, so walk us through what to expect here. You said you had a plan for this exact scenario? Yeah, listen, I don't have a lot of time to get a ticket for this flight. Call Melanie and tell her we're doing Hoolagarification. - What? - Hoolagarification on a plane. She'll explain everything. Just sit tight and if everything goes to plan, this whole thing will be in the bag once we land in San Francisc... [phone clicks] - What's Melanie's number? - Hoola-what? - Jorge, what's her number? - I'll dial it. Calm down. [line ringing] [voicemail] You have reached Melanie Rudoy. - Leave a message or I will never, ever return your call. - [beeps] It's Dom, from Jorge's office. Hoola... Hoolagalination. - [whispers] On a plane. - On a plane. [sniffs] God damn it! Dom, as your only friend... I trusted her! She was the one pushing for this deal, you know? That's why I let her take a lead in this whole affair, and now she's having an affair! Relax. You heard Charlie. He and Melanie have a Hoolagalant plan that's gonna make things right. Just, you have to be patient. Hey, here, here. Have some of my sandwich. - It has Vicodin in it. - No, Jorge! I'm tired of your unbridled, optimistic, "everything's gonna be okay" bullshit! - Everything's not gonna be okay! - Well, keep yelling at me because it's gonna solve everything. My God, look what she's doing to me. [panting] My heart's beating outta my chest. It hurts. I think I'm having a heart attack. [muffled] That's just the uppers. What? You said it wasn't the pills! It's not pills. I mean... [speaking in Spanish] [in English] Look at all that smoke in the distance. We're probably breathing it and we don't even know it. Why isn't she calling back? Hey, relax, it's been only two minutes. You act like we've been waiting forever. [bongos playing] No, there's no such thing as forever. Wait, that window doesn't open! No, no, no, no, no, no! [overlapping voices] -Get the fuck back! I'll smash through it! - Don't do that. - You said it yourself, Jorge! I have a choice in all this. And if I'm gonna lose everything, it'll be on my terms! - But you have to live! - There's nothing to live for! Yes, you have to live for a chance to fight for what you love. I mean, if you really love Lisa, you're not gonna give up on her no matter what. Also, you promised me you will get me a good deal on the Rowley house for a long time now. Are you really gonna jump out of that window and break that promise after everything I've done for you? [tense music] [grunts] You know what? Let me show you something. I wasn't gonna tell anybody about this, but I think this is the only thing that's gonna de-stress you right now. Now I gotta tell you, it might seem scary at first, and I don't really know how it works, but this is some sort of like hallucinogenic smoke or something. But I've done it a bunch of times with Claire and it's completely safe, so don't freak out. Okay? [clicks] [smoke hissing] - [tense music] - [heavy thud] - [whip cracking] - [panting] [grunting] Don't worry. It's... it's completely safe. That's what he thinks. [Jorge yelling] [thuds] [grunts] - Don't act like you don't want it. [moans] This little guy never lies. [laughs] [somber music] [no audible dialogue] [rapping in foreign language] - [whispers in English] What the fuck? - [distorted voice] [screaming] [panting] - [Cassy screaming] Oh, my God, what are you doing? - [Andrew yelling] - [Cassy] So you can just go right now. - [overlapping voices] [Cassy] Go, okay? I don't know. Why are you even here? I said I don't wanna talk to you anymore! - Can you just go? - [Jorge] Yeah, go away. [Cassy] Yeah, what are you saying? Go away. - [Andrew] I just wanna talk. - No, Andrew leave before I call the cops. - I just wanna talk. - Hey, they asked you to leave, man. [Jorge] Yeah, you gotta go. You gotta go. - Why can't we just talk? - [Cassy] No. You have to leave, right? Hey! - Hey! - Asshole! - You wanna get arrested? - [Jorge] Yeah, circus asshole. Fine, I'm going. - [Dom] Hey, what the... - [screaming] Ew! - [grunting] - [bongos playing] God! [yelping and groaning] You son of a bitch! [footsteps thudding] [Jorge yelling indistinctly] - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, thanks. Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed. So that was the ex-boyfriend? Strong emphasis on the ex. What happened to you? Oh, I spilled some... Jorge had this antique whatever it was, it had some oil... I have an extra shirt if you want? I was gonna spend the night at my girlfriend's place tonight. - Oh, no, that's okay. - No, it's fine. It's just a pajama shirt, so it's oversized. It should fit. You can just give it back whenever. Thanks. [footsteps thudding] Jorge, I'm so sorry. I never thought he'd show up like that. I swear, I'm gonna file a restraining order on him. Yeah, don't worry about it. Okay? Hey, listen. [muffled voices] [eerie music] Orange chicken, and add whatever you want there. Hey, don't forget to lock the front door in case that [speaking in Spanish] comes back. - Got it. - [in English] Okay. [Cassy] Any special requests? For food? Oh, not a picky eater. Okay, cool. By the way, I'm going out to drinks with my friend tonight. You two should meet. I have a sixth sense about that stuff. I mean, it's not like you can go home anyway, the highway will probably still be closed. Well, you have a point there. I guess I don't have a reason not to. Great, I'll see you later then. You need to tell me what the fuck that thing is and what just happened because... I know, I know, it's scary at first, but trust me, it's the best stress reliever. How the fuck is that a stress reliever? Ah, you're telling me it didn't get you off? No, it didn't get me off, you sick fuck. Wow, I stopped you from jumping out of that window. - Oh, I'm sorry you had a bad trip. - That wasn't a trip, Jorge. That was some demonic shit! Look at my goddamn neck! - Ha, those are tension marks. - I'm not tense, I was fucking choked. Where'd you get that? Did Claire give it to you? Did she? - So what? - So you said she does witchcraft, that makes her a fucking witch. Does she worship the devil too? - Oh, my God, am I possessed? - You know what? I let you attack me because you're under a lot of stress, but I draw a line here at insulting my wife. If that's what you're gonna be doing... [speaking in Spanish] - No, we gotta destroy this. - [in English] Get off me, you fucking crazy bastard. Get off! Get off! [phone ringing] - Get off me! [grunts] - [ringing continues] Pick up the goddamn phone, it might be Mel. [ringing continues] - [Dom] You pick it up, it's your phone. [Jorge] You idiot, you're gonna mess up the Hooligan plan. [grunting] [phone buzzing] [Dom groaning] Ow! Shit, it's Frances. Hello? Are you at my place? - Don't use your phone. - Fuck, let me call you right back. [phone ringing] - [Frances] Why aren't you using your cell? It's... I'll tell you later. But the house key... Yeah, I know, I'm already inside. Some advice, though, yeah, if you keep your spare key under a fake stone, maybe put some real stones around it. Right, okay. Look, the documents are in my laundry basket. You'll see it, it's right by the bed. You meant on top or in the basket? Like in... - Underneath the clothes. - Oh, gross. Should I even ask at this point? It's kind of complicated right now. Anyway, uh, the envelope's in my desk. Um... Address is on the header of the document, Pert London. Right, okay. I'll go and mail this now. You want the fastest service they have, right? Yeah, but here's the thing. Uh... I kind of need you to wait for a bit until I call you to mail it because I'm waiting on a call. - Well, how long is that? - Like... - Maybe an hour? - An hour? Less than that. Maybe 45 minutes. Ugh, you want me to sit here on my arse for 45 minutes waiting for a phone call? Are you taking the piss? I know, I know how it sounds. But look, order some food, order a movie, do whatever you want there, it's on me. Oh, yeah, whatever I want? Well, I'll swipe someone on Tinder and bugger a guy in your bed, then, eh? I would rather you didn't, but if that's what you want. Fucking hell, Dom, this is mental, you know that? I know, but if there were a time that I desperately needed to use my family card, it's now. So please do not mail it until I call you to. All right, then, call me. - Thank you. - [phone clicks] Give me some of that. I always wanted to ask, why the hell do you call your office Soto Health Accounting Clinic? Makes no sense. For the search results of course. I am the number one Soto business search result for this area. And you know why? Because "health clinic" is such a popular search term, so everybody's clicking on my website. [laughing] [eerie music] [laughing stops] - What the fuck? [panting] - Dom? - Dom! - [Mel] Dom, I got your message. - What did Charlie tell you exactly? - He didn't tell us anything. What the hell is a Hoolagalifinakis? Well, Hoolagarification was a battle plan Charlie and I used back in the day to get the best deal in a divorce by having Charlie stake out on a trip to record a cheating spouse with their lover and then serving the divorce papers right on the trip before they had any chance to cover it up. Like on a cruise, a plane, or an airport, things like that. Don't ask me about the name, Charlie came up with it. Okay, so Charlie gets all the evidence on the plane and serves the papers at the airport? Then that gives me more say in what happens with the company, right? Well, no, because this plan doesn't work anymore. What do you mean it doesn't work? You said you did it before. Yes, but that was a long time ago. I don't think Charlie realizes how much laws have changed since he retired. Now it's all no-fault divorce, which means infidelity really has no impact in divorce proceedings unless you specifically signed a prenuptial agreement with an infidelity clause. Do you have a prenup? - No, but... - [Jorge] Can't he sue them or something? I mean, if one of their partners is cheating with Lisa and she's been pushing to sell the company to them, isn't that like illegal conspiracy or something? More like just bad fucking luck, unfortunately. Look, if she hasn't closed the deal yet and you want to cancel, then don't sign anything. But bottom line is, Charlie can come back with a sex tape and she will still take half of everything. - Oh. - I know that might be difficult to hear, Dom. But at least when Charlie lands, you will know if Lisa's cheating or not cheating on you. Simple. Anyway, I have to go, but best of luck to you and let me know if you end up filing for divorce. I will give you good rate. Jorge, I'll see you at the club, huh? Maybe bring Dom. I'm sure some Soft Corn will help him forget about Lisa. [laughing] [piano music] [singing in a foreign language] [Dom crying] - [knocking on door] - [music fades] [in English] And you are probably thinking some bad thoughts right now. But before you do anything, just let me say that we don't know if she really is cheating until the plane lands and we hear from Charlie. So right now, it's a kind of a premature lamentation. - [music continues over earbuds] - [sobbing continues] Okay, and you know what, even if she's cheating, which I still think she's not, but if she is, there's plenty fish in the water, right? What about that girl you met on the online game? Cosmo, Cosmic? And you know what, also Cassy can help you out too. Oh, she loves to set people up, and she has a lot of very young and beautiful friends. Come on, Dom. Hey, buddy, listen, you cannot be hard on yourself. I mean, at the end of the day, we're all just animals trying to get our fix. That's all love is, it's chemicals swirling in our heads. And who knows, maybe Lisa, she has some chemical imbalance right now, and you cannot control that. But you know what? You know how we can fight those bad chemicals in your head right now? [laughs] Watch. I have morphine pills. Oh, this will cheer you right up. You don't need love. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And these, oh, you know what these are? Oh, my God. Hey, Dom, you know what these are? I got it from my nephew, it's like some kind of special Mexican LSD. If you take this, you cannot be sad. You maybe be a little scared, if you're not in the right mindset, but definitely not sad, okay? Uh... You know what? You know what these kids are calling it in the streets? [laughs] Oh, my God, they call it panocha de angel. [laughter echoes] [Jorge] Here, here, here, watch. Oh. [female voice] Panocha de angel. Angel pussy. Jorge, thanks for everything. You've been a good friend. I'm going home. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You cannot go home. The highway's still closed. Still fire. - I'll go around it. - No, it's gonna take you forever. Maybe hours. Hey, why you don't stay at my place? I'm sure Claire would love to have you over. No, you've done enough already. Okay, hey, listen, it's not good to be alone in this type of situation. I'm not alone, my cousin's at my house. If you're worried about me trying to off myself, I'm pretty sure she'd try to stop me. Okay, okay, okay, let's get your jacket. You know how this fires make it really windy outside. - I didn't bring a jacket. - See, that's why you cannot go home. You cannot even remember what you were wearing when you came in here. You left it in the couch, in my office. [door closes] - Hey, I don't see a... - Swallow. Swallow, Dominic. I'm trying to save your life. Swallow, the panocha de angel. It's gonna help you out. Listen to me, I'm doing this to save your life. Swa... Ow! [grunts] - [groaning] - [coughing] You're a fucking drug addict, Jorge. You know that? You're a fucking drug addict. - I'm doing this to save you. - You... are... a... fucking... drug addict! No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't break that! Don't break that! Fuck! Puta madre! Claire is gonna kill me. [panting] [sobbing] [succubus] Poor baby. Ah! [panting] No, please don't eat my soul. Don't worry, I'm not that kind of a lover. Please don't eat my brains. That's a zombie, baby. I don't do that either. What... what are you? I'm a succubus, honey. We feast on the lust of a man. Are you real or am I hallucinating? I don't know. - Does this feel like a hallucination to you? - [grunts] - But I destroyed your box! - [chuckles] Demons don't possess objects, baby. They possess people. But I saw you come out of it. That's for show. For Jorge. To make him feel more comfortable with me and the deal I made with his wife. I keep him in check and in return I get to snack. Here and there. How about you, Dom? I can make you forget her. Replace all those hurtful memories... with good ones. [tense music] You just have to say yes. [Dom] I can't. This is wrong. It's not cheating if Lisa's already doing it. I don't even know if she's really... I need to hear from Charlie. I won't know for sure until the plane lands. I need to wait for Charlie. You're just putting off the inevitable, Dom. You already know the truth. You saw it in the look. - No. - Remember? No, I don't. I don't know for sure. Yes, you do. Go ahead, call Frances. Ask her the question that's been burning in the back of your mind. The one you've been too afraid to ask the moment you thought of it. [Frances] There you are. Am I mailing this or what? Not yet, I'm still waiting to hear back from someone. All right, whatever. I ended up watching Battlefield Earth and now I want to finish it. Why do you have this on Blu-ray anyway? - [TV laughter] - Uh, it's Lisa's, not mine. Really? She likes these kind of movies? Hey, can you check something for me, in the bathroom next to my bedroom? All right, one sec. - I'm here, what is it? - Check in the cabinet behind the door, there should be like a small wicker basket thing there. Okay, there's pills in here. Are there any birth control pills in there? Mmm, no, it's just Motrin IB and some Advil. Okay. Thanks. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm just tired. You know, with everything. What is everything, Dom? You know you can talk to me, right? Are you and Lisa okay? Okay, I'm just gonna let you finish your movie. Call you back in a few. Dom, wait. Dom... She was supposed to go off the pill this month... after we sold the company. We were gonna work less hours, start a family. Maybe she threw away the pills since, you know, it was time. Is that what you really believe? [Dom] Yes. Yes, I wanna forget. [tense music] [muffled] Lisa? Lisa! Lisa! Lisa. Lisa. - Lisa, Lisa. - Let her go. [gasps] I... am... your... Lisa now! [cackling] [music continues] [operatic music] - I can't, I don't wanna do this anymore. - Stop fighting me! This is what you want. No, I remember the coffee! Even if I was at the end of the room in a meeting and we had the fight the night before, Lisa always gave me my coffee first before anyone else. And I've been treating her like a coworker. Lisa is cheating on you. You saw the "looook" she gave him. No amount of coffee is going to change that. I don't care. She still gave me my coffee before him. That means she still chooses to put me first. Jorge's, right, I have to focus on the right details. I have a choice. I'm gonna start over and make sure I'm going to put Lisa first, no matter what. [gasps] Oh, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. [sobbing] How boring. [thuds] [buckling pants] [line ringing] [Charlie's voicemail] Hey-lo, you know who this is! Stay late... Shit, I got it wrong. - [beeps] - Charlie, it's Dom. I change my mind. I don't want to know anything you found out on the plane. You hear me? Don't call me back. Just send my bill to Jorge's office. [phone beeps] [line ringing] - [TV laughter] - [Frances] You know what? I'm ashamed to admit, but I kind of like this movie. Hey, you can go ahead and mail the papers now. Okay. - Are you crying? - [sniffles] No. [sniffles] [phone beeps] [line ringing] -[Lisa's voicemail] You've reached Lisa, leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. [beeps] Hey, it's me. I mailed the papers and, uh... [gentle music] I just wanted to thank you for doing this trip. If it wasn't for the plane, you know, I would. [sobs] I love you, Lisa. I'm sorry I haven't said this in a long time. [music continues] And I'm sorry I've been taking you for granted. But I want you to know that I love you so much. I wanna have a family with you... and let you tie me up and do whatever you wanted to do to me because I love you so much. And when you come back... I'll make sure you never forget it. [sobbing] Well... well, that's all. Bye. [phone beeps] Jorge! Jorge! Hey, wake up! Chinese food's here. Call 911. [siren blares in distance] [Cassy inhales, sighs] They're pretty sure he's just severely dehydrated and just needs some fluids, but they're gonna take him to the emergency room just in case. I called Claire and told her, she's gonna head over to the hospital right now. That's good. Thanks for doing that. Hey, if you can keep all of this... Don't even worry about it. When that door closes... [clicks tongue] Won't even ask how you got those marks on your neck. Jorge may have given me some substances. I know, that's why I don't ask. Just make sure Jorge takes it easy, okay? I'm not planning on leaving this office anytime soon. Noted. Let me run to the bathroom, then I'll lock up? - [door opens] - [phone buzzes] [gentle music] - [birds chirping] - [dog barks] [phone buzzes] [female voice] You have one new voice message. [Rita] Dom, I have some bad news. The Rowley house burned down. I'm headed out for the day, just thought you should know. - Bye. - Aw, shit. Hey, I think I'll have to skip out on the drinks with your friend for tonight. What? Don't say you have to go home, the highways are still closed. - I checked. - No, I think I should go check on Jorge at the hospital. He invited me to stay over at his place tonight, so this is the least I can do as a friend. Ugh, I guess that's an acceptable excuse. Well, let me give you my number. Just in case. Thanks. Cheer up, Dom. There's always a reason to smile. [upbeat music]
