BUT IT'S A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU ARE HERE. SIT DOWN. BE COMFORTABLE. OKAY, MR. TORVALD. I DID NOT SEND IT. - I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - NO? WELL. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO ONE INTERESTING, FASCINATING LADY. MAYBE YOU'LL BE INSPIRED. I KNOW WE WERE. Terri's my sister. And, uh, she's my favorite person in the whole world. She like a challenge. She thrives when she's pushed. And the people who can do that, They don't live in Flagstaff. Terri deserves a chance to learn from the best. She's already good. But she could be great. ( silent ) If you let her in, you won't be disappointed. ( silent ) - ( crying ) - HEY, TERRI? TERRI! TERRI. ARE YOU OKAY? PLEASE. IT'S PROBABLY JUST SOME WEIRDO MISFIT THING. NO. THE SHOW'S OVER.

AND HE DIED AND I DIDN'T. YOU KNOW? AND I DON'T KNOW WHY. BUT I MISS HIM. THE SECOND I START TO FEEL LIKE I'M ENJOYING MYSELF, THIS VOICE COMES INSIDE MY HEAD AND... IT'S LIKE, "HOW CAN YOU BE HAVING A GOOD TIME WHEN PAUL IS DEAD?" YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF LIKE THAT. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT WAS MY FAULT. I GOT HIM TO SNEAK OUT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE RISKED IT. LOOK, TERRI. SOME IDIOT RAN A RED LIGHT. IT WAS BAD LUCK. MESSED UP TIMING. THAT'S ALL. YOU WEREN'T THERE. Jay: LOOK, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. BUT I DO KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE BACKING DOWN CAN BECOME A WAY OF LIFE. DON'T LEAVE. SCREW THE PRESSURE. SCREW THE SCHOLARSHIP. I MEAN, DO YOUR OWN THING ON YOUR OWN TERMS. AND GET WHAT YOU CAME HERE FOR. - THAT'S WHAT COUNTS. - BUT JAY, I'M LYING TO PEOPLE. I MEAN, I HAD TO LIE TO GET HERE. SO WHAT. YOU GOT HERE. IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO BE EASY. YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO. WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH? I DON'T KNOW. I LIKE YOU. AND ROBIN FITS INTO THAT, HOW? WE MET HERE LAST YEAR AND... WE HAD A THING FOR A WHILE.
