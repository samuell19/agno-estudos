LIFE WITH THE KIDS When will we see you again? Anna, dear, I don't know. Soon. We were together for 2 weeks. I've never had such a nice, long holiday! Where are you going now? Paris, Madrid, London and Palermo. And then Bern. Want anything from Switzerland? Just yourself, as quick as you can. Don't forget about February 15th. February 15th? Ah, right, I won't forget February 15th. I did the math: after 23 years of marriage, we've been alone for 2 years and 11 months. Yes but with 5 kids, no real fights, and we still like to make love. Not bad, eh? And you think you're the only woman I love? Mom! Dad! Let's hurry up, the kids are ready. Bye, kids! - Bye, Mom! Keep an eye on the kids. - Bye, dear. When do you leave? - In a half hour. Book at Toscano's. I hope Gina prepared something for tonight. Please, it's Sunday! Are you eating with us, Valeria? Divorced and alone, if you want me. Have the kids hurry, it'll soon be dark. Alright. Who's coming with us? - Only Tony, Dad. Where's Tony? - I think in the hotel. And what will you do? - We'll return in Remo's jeep. Who is Remo? - Maurizio's friend, Dad. He arrived yesterday. That guy with the beard! That guy? Certainly, Maurizio always picks his friends with a magnifying glass. He's a clever boy, a poet. - There are no more poets. Councilor, stop flirting with a minor! She was just asking something. - Dad! My law friend asked me to. He's looking for experience. OK. Want to get something? Yes, but first I must call Simona in Milan. We must decide. You want coffee? - I'll have some. Thank you. What's your name? - Roberto. Will you dine with us tonight? - Thanks, Engineer. Paolo? Then the two of you are coming with Maurizio, OK? Come on, Toni. - What will you do? Well done! Well done. My son. Remember, tonight at Toscano's! Roger! - Bye. My God, what a disaster. Let's go before Tony wakes up? Careful! Careful, I'm in pain! Oh my God? God, hear our humble prayers for the soul of our sister. And let her, freed by death, enjoy an immortal life in serene peace for the sake of Christ, our Savior. Amen. Rest in peace. - Amen. No, Gina, thanks. I don't feel like it. Dottore, a little will do you good. - That's enough. Thanks. Maria Luisa, how is school going? I'm not in school anymore, Dad. I work at the data center of the merchant bank. Oh, well. Sorry. Dad, why do you always say "sorry" and "thanks"? Are you in 4th grade? No, the 5th. I skipped a year. Good. It's cold today. Did you turn off the heat, Gina? Yes, I turned it off at 11. The poor lady? Please, Gina, stop saying "the poor lady." And you, Maurizio? - Me? If this is what you want to know: I'm in my 2nd year of law, and I haven't taken any exams. Alright. Paolo! It's for you! Who is it? - Roberto. Who is Roberto? Paolo's best friend. You saw him at the mountain. Ah, right. Francesca, it's for you: Anselmo. Who is Anselmo? Francesca's boyfriend: the latest model. It was Anselmo. He wanted to give his condolences. Lucky her, she can cry. I can't. Tony, hurry up or you'll be late! Gina, where are my jeans? Don't yell or you'll wake Dad! - Paolo! I'm ready, Francesca! You coming? No, I'll go with Simona. - Who'll take Tony? Tony comes with me! I'm going! C'mon, Tony! - Gina, shut them up! Will you stop yelling! You woke up your dad! You leave without saying goodbye? Dad? Did we wake you? Sorry. Bye! Tony! Bye, Daddy. A big kiss! Wait, I'm going on the elevator! Tony, say goodbye to Dad! C'mon, Tony, you're always last! Wake up, lazybones! Go earn money for your children! Bye, Dad! I'm having lunch with Roberto! See ya tonight! Alright! They woke you up, eh? Oh, no! - You heard that confusion? Where's Maurizio? - Still asleep. I'll make you some coffee. I was the director of a big pharmaceutical company. I was successful. I had been traveling the world for 20 years. But I felt that now was the time to take a break. Dear kids, we haven't been together very much these last years. And I realize that to you, I'm almost a stranger. But I want to get to know you better. If you prefer, I'll talk to you one by one, to speak freely. Dad, we don't have any secrets. That's a great consolation to me. I don't know? you, Paolo, for example. What is this? An interrogation? - Let him talk. Well, I really don't have anything to say. Absolutely nothing? Dad, I gotta run. I've a date. And you don't have anything to say either? About what? Anything. For example? I don't know. Maybe you have a girlfriend, a fianc?e? And if I did, you think I'd tell you? See ya tomorrow. Bye. And you, Francesca? - I don't feel like talking tonight. Excuse me. I need to make a call. Aren't you being a bit indiscreet, Dad? Don't make me laugh, Maria Luisa! I'm looking after you, my kids. Your future, your? plans, as well as your personal life, of course. To lend you a hand, if it's necessary? To be by your side. See, regarding my business, I speak willingly when I want to. Not when you ask me. Dad, you must trust us. - Who said I didn't? You by interrogating us. Excuse me. See you tomorrow. You're not angry, are you? No. Quite the opposite? Dad, I'm going to the game. - In this rain? Milan's playing tonight. Wanna come too? What do you think, Toni? That you really screwed up, Adriano. What do you mean? - You messed up. Ah, yes. Sorry, if I insist but this wine's no good. Fine, next time you choose. - Who's that? I can never remember her name. - Mahalindi. Indian? - No. Kenyan. There's something which since this morning has been in my head? By the way, do you remember what happened on February 15th? Only that it's my birthday. I'm sorry. That's why Anna kept telling me not to forget that day. We've been having lunch together on February 15th for 15 years. First you, Anna, Giorgio and me. Then you, Anna and me. And tonight, you and me. Why did I never manage to fall in love with you? You demand nothing but really, you deserve everything. Why? Because you're a fool. Of course. Taxi! - Maria Luisa! Where are you going? I need to see somebody. - Why not use your car? Because it needs repairs. But don't tell Dad anything, please. Alright. Where was my daughter going alone in a taxi at lunch hour? And why did she say to Francesca "don't tell Dad?" Am I stranger to her? I suddenly felt a feeling, I've never experienced before: jealousy. What? Are you crazy? Who gave you a license? Who? Why are you yelling? Can't you read? S-T-O-P! You know what that means? It means "stop," idiot! You made me lose my taxi, idiot! You made me lose my taxi! - What taxi, you damn asshole? You're lucky you're young and pretty! - Get lost! Go away! Go! Now my car won't work! Let's not fool ourselves, Valeria. I haven't watched her enough. Indeed, I haven't watched at all. I think you're fooling yourself. She's young, pretty. Probably has a boyfriend A lover. Else, why take a taxi? A taxi means a lover? - Yes! Lovers go by taxi! Besides, who is this scoundrel? - Why don't you ask her? That'd be too easy. She says nothing. This morning when I asked her, she said she was a mature adult! And not to interfere with her privacy! Of course, she was very close to her mother. She would've told her? told anybody else. Maybe including Gina. And what does Gina say? - Ah! The hypocrite. She told me "She took a taxi because her car's in the shop." But her car was in the garage. I saw it. Have you tried talking to the kids? Sometimes, among themselves? A wall of silence. I asked Tony this morning and he answered with a little smile. No, I'm the stranger, the party pooper. What can I do? Follow her at night on foot? Why don't you let her be? It seems ridiculous to me. Besides, even if she has a lover? C'mon, Valeria, please! I won't give up my paternal rights! I already did too much of that. I want to know who he is. Maybe he's a jerk, a criminal, a drug addict! Try to give me some good advice instead of generalities. Well, I do have an idea. Can I trust your Sherlock Holmes? It was he who found out about Giorgio and Marilena. This is it. If it weren't for him, my husband would still be in my way. TOM FINZI PRIVATE DETECTIVE I understood right away. More or less, like I knew with the lady's husband. Not so quickly. It took 3 years. No, 2! And now remember: dissimulation, especially with your daughter. For the rest, leave it to us. We'll keep you informed. Just like we did with the lady. Even if her case is a bit different. For the bill, don't worry, Rosanna will send it tomorrow. Goodbye - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Bye. I don't like this beanpole. - You have no choice. Money wasted. - Finzi Agency? Pass it here, Roberto! Over here! Pass it over here! Goal! Don't come in, we're playing! - Throw it here! What's going on here? Ball in the house? Are you crazy? Want to destroy everything? Well! Maria Luisa? She called that she'd stay out tonight. Out? And Francesca? In the kitchen with a plumber. "Plato says the soul of man consists of three parts." What are they? Well then? the rational soul, the choleric soul? and the concupiscent soul. Well? - Hi, Dad. This is Anselmo. We're preparing for next week's exam. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Francesca! You want to tell me something? Yes. But first turn off the music! That boy is a plumber? He works to pay for his studies. He studies philosophy. Is there anything between you? Yes. We love each other. Since when? For about? 6 or 7 months. Mom didn't know? No. What do you do together? Do you go? to the movies, to dance at the disco? Yes, sometimes. And? You want to know if we sleep together? No, I didn't ask that. - But you want to know. Well, yes. The answer is no. Happy? I'm still a virgin. And when I'm not anymore, you'll be the first to know. Alright? You're dressed. Where are you going? To Simona's. There's a party. With the plumber? - Yes, I'm going with him. Kisses. Don't stay out late! Yes, Eng Setti, in a few days, at most, certain checks will be over, but we're on the right path. The jackpot, I'd say. Please, Finzi, be discreet. If my daughter finds out I had her watched, all hell'll break loose at home, beyond imagining. Look, I'm in the trenches by myself with 5 kids ready to shoot me at the slightest slip up. Don't worry, Eng Setti. If you knew my experience, this is child's play! He laughs best who laughs last. Goodbye. What are you doing? Let me see. Let me see! Forging my signature, eh? "Excellent. Excellent. Good. Excellent." Why? Conduct. "Insufficient." That's why. Aren't you ashamed? Please, Adriano! Paolo's waiting for me upstairs. I'm late. Give me the report card. It's signed anyway. Go. We'll settle this tonight. And you'll explain why you call me "Adriano" and not "Dad." It's more buddy-buddy, no? That asshole! That cuckold son of a bitch! He wanted to screw me over! Me? Maurizio! Yeah? Who's that guy? - A friend. Did he sleep over? - No. What does he do? - He has no job. But he's giving me a hand for my article on urban violence. I see. Want to meet him? - Yes. Pinuzzo! Come here! This is my father. - Hi, handsome. Hi. So, how did the story end you were telling me about? I stabbed him in the stomach. Did you go to jail? - I got two years. A suspended sentence. - That doesn't seem like much. The judge was screwing my sister. - I see now. Without the slightest doubt? - None. This man is a real scoundrel: well known for his Don Juan activities, especially with minors. My daughter is an adult. Well, then we can do nothing. We can't press charges, ask for damages or send him to jail. But we can the hospital! Where are you going? Just to prove that we Italians, thank God, never change. Even if the so-called "honor killing" is no longer part of our law. The right reactions of a betrayed husband are still accepted by a learned court which adjudicated my client. Fabrizio! - Yes? No, no! Adriano! Scoundrel! Scoundrel! Adriano! - You should get 30 years! 30 years, worm! Disgusting wretch! Bastard! - Who was that? Adriano! - Who is he? Nobody. Just a friend. No, you're wrong. I have no apologies to give. I don't want an apology. My fling with Fabrizio lasted a few days, more than 6 months ago. But he wouldn't stop insisting, stop pestering me! I saw him that day to tell him to stop. Because I'm pregnant. What great news! When are you getting married? - Married? Not on your life! We've decided to live together. Then I'll go talk to Fabrizio. That old pig! Fabrizio? Maybe you didn't understand, Dad. - Why? Isn't he the father? - Oh, no! My man's name is Sergio, an architect, works for an ad agency. He's a very clever guy. I'll give you his business card. He can help your firm if you decide to modernize. No, thank you. I don't need the address of your lover. And neither does my firm! Dad, when you say "lover", you seem just like an old prig. You're becoming violent. What's happening? OK, what's the architect like? Seeing you've already met him. He's nice. He's minds his own business. No, I mean in his job. Wait. Excuse me, may I take a look? Please do. - Thank you. Do you see this? One of his creations. A great success, Dad! "Designer Macaroni" "A revolution in the world of pasta" Is he a cook? No, Dad, he's a designer. He designed the macaroni. I'll never eat pasta shaped like this. Return it to him. Thank you. Thank you. Designer macaroni! Hi, Francesca. My father in? I must speak to him. I'll see if he can. - Thanks. What happened, eh? What is it? - Dad? today is my birthday and you forgot it. I'll forgive you, if give me a gift. What? - Buy me a picture. By whom? - A Dutch artist. It's not Van Gogh, is it? No, he's living. He exhibits nearby. Will you go with me? The communication between the pictorial material and what it indicates. Raise your head, Francesca. Don't lean. This way, man absorbs and preserves, forming a union between his soul and the artist's through the work. Great. Your daughter is very good at pictorial art. Strange: She never could draw a straight line. Oh, no! I recognized her talent right away. She's very good. Very good. She'll have much future with me on the sidewalks of Amsterdam. Francesca? Francesca! I'll bring you home. Dad, in an hour I have a dance lesson. What's your artist friend's name? Van Hoffen. Ruud Van Hoffen. Do you like him? Yes, he's really nice. - I'm happy. Dear Francesca, if I did it, I only did it for your own good. I know what's good for me! If I hadn't received this letter, I would've never known the truth. You're a reactionary, a persecutor, a racist! One who uses his connections to get rid of foreigners! Xenophobic! Fascist! Well then? Are you moving to Holland, to walk the streets of Amsterdam? You're leaving home too? Like your sister Maria Luisa? I'm not a fool like my sister, burying herself in the outskirts. I'm fine here and will get by just fine! At your expense. But it's over between us! Hi, Roberto. - Hello, Mr Setti. No, sit down. Is Paolo still asleep? - No, he went out to play soccer. And you? - I don't know how to play. And Paolo forgot to tell me yesterday. And what are you doing now? - Waiting until he returns. He should be back by noon. You have nothing else to do? - No. If I knew where he plays, I'd go there. Paolo's really a jerk. When he comes back, he'll get it. No, forget it. He didn't do it on purpose. But you wouldn't have forgotten. No? You shouldn't be so nice. Paolo must learn how to live. It's no big deal. A friend must be himself. A lesson would do him good. - Perhaps. But I'm fine with him way he is. Maybe I have a different temperament. Maybe you're too nice. Doctor, come here please! Shall we have a coffee? - Of course. Look what I found in Maurizio's room. Is this the first time you've seen this? Where was it? - Under the lamp. Where's Maurizio? - He left early this morning. A cautious response would be better than an abrupt one. That's my advice. Youth is so unpredictable in these cases, you never know what decision they'll make. Do you have children? - One. Does he give you trouble? - Fortunately, no. By the way, Engineer, I made a test on the powder. Hi. Well? Your son? False alarm. It was bicarbonate. - What a sigh of relief. If he didn't use it to dilute pure cocaine as the investigator says. What are you having? - Iced tea. What are you looking at? - That guy has been stalking me. Which guy? - That one. Are you sure? - You're impossible! Do you think I'm so old nobody would ever stalk me? No, it's probably just someone going the same way. He's a maniac. You don't know what he said to me. There he is. One aperitif! A caipirinha? - Yes, alright. What are you doing? Look, how dare you bother my wife? I quietly complimented her. You know I should slap you? - Let me introduce myself: Bronze wrestling medalist at the Seoul Olympics. Adriano Setti, a pleasure. How much is it? I'm pleased. First, because you didn't use your hands, second, because you're jealous. - You think so? You're lucky?! - Be quiet. I'm very curious to know where my daughter lives and with whom. And who is this man she loves so much to give birth to his child which I already didn't like because in a few years, he'll call me gramps. What stuff? Maria Luisa! Maria Luisa! - Dad! Yes? How nice to see you! Weren't you coming with Francesca? No, I had a fight with Francesca over a Dutchman. A sidewalk artist. Please! I bet she's already forgotten him. Sergio! - Yes? This is Sergio. Sergio! Sergio, this is dad. A pleasure. - Pleased to meet you. Very good. I'll get you a whiskey. No, thanks. In a few minutes? Maybe a small one. Just a sip for a few minutes. Very good. Who is that like a Hawaiian? A cover girl. Sergio photographs for fashion magazines too. Here's the whiskey. Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you know, Dad, we two, Sergio and I have decided to get married. Doesn't it seem a bit? soon? Do you want me to marry with a big belly? Well then, to the health of all three of you! And yours too. Come, come! Let's take a nice group photo! Wait! Dad! Where's Valeria? Dad, next to the bride! Here I am. With her. A nice smile everybody. A nice smile, kids. The bridegroom kiss the bride. Are you moved? Well, a little. After all, I lost a daughter. You've discovered fatherhood late but you've discovered it poorly. No, when your daughter marries, that means you're old. What nonsense talk! Why don't you hibernate if you want to stay the same? I don't like the cold. - You know what I think? It's jealousy. Maria Luisa is with another man and tonight she sleeps with him. Yesterday's news. - Yes. But since yesterday, you were the father and master, you judged, gave orders. Today she even changed her name. I advised her to keep her own. Do you know what his name is? Sergio Tapparella (Roller Blinds). You think I can have a daughter named Tapparella? Huh? - No! Tapparella! What are you doing? Coming up? No, I'm not in the mood today. Excuse me. Bye. Maria Luisa is married and has gone with a stranger. Another piece of my family has broken off from me. I was feeling sad and a bit lonely. I'm saved! Lord, so much water! 5 minutes more and I'd be soaked. What will your boyfriend say when he doesn't see you? He's not my boyfriend, just a guy who gave me a ride. My car broke down, damn it. Where should I take you? I work in a travel agency. Sempione Avenue, No. 8. Going my way? No, but? it doesn't matter. Why are you so nice? Because I'm a pretty girl? Well, yes. My name is Elda. And you? Adriano. Would you believe that I was sure that I'd meet you? No. I may have seen you on the cover of "Capital," right? You may have. Then I said to myself, "This is man my kind of man. I'd really like to meet him." No lie. Look, I'm? I'm 50 years old, I have 5 children, I'm a widower, and almost a grandpa. That doesn't scare me. Drop me off here, please. We're there. Well then, goodbye and thank you. You know what? I could fall in love with you. I was sure I'd never see her again, but a few days later, without realizing it, I found myself at the travel agency where worked that girl, called Elda. Hello, are you interested in something from the East? No, the East? Africa? I'm not sure what? I'm just looking? - Please do. A nice tan. The Maldives? - No, Idroscalo. Good day! Hello. - Where would you like to go? This place. No, I'm kidding. Not too far away. A half hour by car, there's a very nice restaurant? where one can eat well. It's a real shame, but I can't today. And tomorrow? You don't work on Sundays, I hope. - No. Tomorrow, I'm free. You want to choose a wine? You want to choose a wine? Ah, wine. We've already chosen: Ch?teauneuf du Pape. Very good. Thank you. What color are your eyes? What color do you think they are? The most beautiful color in the world. And yours are green. Green? means hope. We saw each other almost every night for weeks. And then she just disappeared. And then nothing. As if she were dead. Do you know where to find her? - I have her number but the last time we met, she said she would call me. How am I? - Nothing. A small arrhythmia. Your blood pressure's high. - A lot? No, nothing to worry about. It's probably the emotion. You're excited. How old is this girl? The same age as Maria Luisa. - And how old is she? 22. A bit young, eh? She'd rather be the one to call. She said it'd be easier for both of us. You overcomplicate life. Why don't you go boating? Or play golf? I feel myself ridiculous with a sense of guilt. Do you like this girl? Then look for her. The worst that can happen is she doesn't want to see you. The truth is, after a week, you'll be fed up and want to leave. If you want my advice, try to find her and make love. Once a day, in the morning on an empty stomach. I don't know if I can. What were you thinking? I was talking about these! This is a sedative to calm your nerves. Let's hope so. Bye, Umberto. The prescription. Adriano, you put on my jacket! See? I lost my head. Hello? - Hello. I fooled you, right? Well, leave me a nice message, and I'll call you back. Kisses. The only thing I can tell you is? your silence hurts me? that followed our last meeting. This is Adriano. The man in the rain. Do you still remember me? See you soon. I hope. Engineer? Another signature, please. Concierge! - Who are you looking for? I'm looking for Miss Elda Manuzzio. Ah, great! You've finally came. Don't move from there. When will they decide to put in an elevator? Wait, I'm coming down to give you the keys! Keys? What keys? What? Haven't you come to fix the young lady's TV? No, I just wanted to know when Elda would be back. Who knows? Once she was gone for a month. Thank you. Good night! Are you her dad? Francesca! What are you doing? - What do you want? And you, leave right now! - Me? - Why? I said so! - Then he won't! Who says? - I do! And next time, knock! And don't bug us, please. Ma'am? Mrs Gina, where are you going? Engineer, you have a visitor. I'll call you next week. Yes, we'll talk again. I'll show you out. Until next time. Well, Gina, what is it? - Dottore, it's better we have this out for once and for all. This way. Well? What happened was I caught Francesca kissing her boyfriend. And she threw me out saying, "Gina, don't bug me." Then if I'm only annoying, it's better that I leave. Gina, don't exaggerate. You know how Francesca is. That's how she talks, no? And besides, you know? I couldn't do without you, Gina. Especially now that Anna's gone. I'm quitting anyway. But Gina, do you realize?? Listen, if I? raise your salary a little? It's not about money. Then, tell me Gina, what is it about? Self-respect. You're right, kids are difficult but they're honest, kind, sincere. And that's why they say the first thing in their heads. Yes, sometimes, they manage to offend us but bless them, only because they lack our experience. However, it's up to you to decide, Gina. No, Dottore, I've decided. Poor Anna has left us this cross. Let us try not to betray her by refusing it. Think it over, Gina. You'll change your mind. I doubt it. And yet, is it true what you said? - What did I say? That you'd double my salary? I said that?? Ah, yes, I'd raise it a little? Of course. I quite forgot: somebody called you today, a certain Elda. Elda? - Yes. Hey, baby, where are you going? Come with us! - Adriano! Baby, don't give your pussy to him, he's old! Finally. Do you know how long it's been since I've seen you? 6 weeks, 3 days and 1 hour. Ah! This is very nice. I did it myself. Do you like it? Very much. My compliments. Who is that here? - A friend. And this one? - Nobody, a dummy. You keep photos of dummies? Why did you suddenly disappear? Without saying a word. They make us leave at any moment without notice. It was impossible. But you could've sent a message, a postcard, phoned me. But I told you, I was in Bangkok, Singapore and then in Hong Kong. So? Couldn't you call from Hong Kong? In Hong Kong, the phones are horrible. I tried. - Please! I've been to Hong Kong. The only thing that works there are the phones. Do you know I like it when you're jealous? Shall we have a drink? You know what I want. Tomorrow, I'm free all day You know what I'd like? To go somewhere outside of Milan. I can't sit still for 5 minutes. It's incredible! It's fantastic! I? I had already forgotten what it means to feel young! When I'm next to her, I feel 30 years younger. Not bad with 5 children. And a grandkid on the way. So? Why? Excuse me, perhaps? you mean I made a mistake? - No. Not if you're happy. I wish you to be as long as possible. It isn't easy. It's only? Can I ask you something? - Yes. Don't come visit me and don't call me for a while. Oh, come on, Valeria? - No, please! I'm not an expert in love at first sight. So excuse me, I can't share in your long, overdue infatuation. Good night. Beef wellington? - For me. Frog chicken? - For me, thanks. You want a board? - No, thank you, leave it. Go on, continue, Adriano. - Do you know how long Italian men can last sexually? Well, it depends on? it depends on the object of desire and the man's "wealth." Then, according to you, there's no danger if from time to time, one may? be without umm? "change?" No. Not as long as his "wealth" remains. Look, do you trust your doctor to give you some advice on the pace of these happy encounters? Why? Why would that matter? Because young women expect a lot. Right. And even if the sex? continues to work, sometimes other things stop working or begin to fail. Like what? - For example, the nerves. Or the capability to keep concentrating. The heart. Like in every huge effort, right? Is that her? Yes. I'm going. Come on, Adriano, don't refuse a lunch like this. As Gina says, "The mouth will eat, when there's meat." Then you eat it all, including the cheese. I'm going. "In love, he wins who flies." Is that a saying of Gina's? - No, mine. Excuse me for one moment. Listen, cheese for the gentleman. Charge it to my account. Look who's here. Good day, Dr Setti. How are you? Dr Setti would've liked to have been called at your return. Of course. But I wasn't at home or at work. I don't believe you. Who are those guys? Who do you think they are dressed like that? Cops? And that blonde guy? I've already told you that I like it when you're jealous. Bye. See you tomorrow. What is it, Adriano? Did you change your mind? I'm done with that girl. Please. - No! You were right. - Me? Done. Over. Forever. I swear it! I pick out the one in orange. I like that brunette over there. - I like the one with the small nose. And I like all of them! Boys, stop looking! Come on, they're ugly! Go study, the exams are tomorrow! We were studying anatomy! I still choose the blonde. She was incredible. No, the brunette was better. Legs like a doll! "According to Girolamo Arnobio, the celebrated schoolmaster of the Sicca Veneria Church, Numidia?" "In the elegy of Cato, written by Cicero in 46 BC, Caesar responded?" - Poor children! "In the early 20th century, the famous Wright Brothers realized man's great dream to get off the ground and fly." Busy! "It is the east and Juliet is the sun. Rise fair sun and kill the envious moon." Etc, etc? - Bravo! Who was that? - Shakespeare. Did you hear how good Alessandro was? What are you bringing? - "To Silvia." Is that Leopardi? - Yes. How does it go? "Silvia, do you remember the moments, in your mortal life, when beauty still shone?" - Ah, cookies! "In your sidelong, laughing eyes?" "Towards us coming in a boat an old man with the hair of eld, crying, "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!" - Well done! "Hope no more to look upon heaven, I come to lead you to the other shore, to the eternal shades in heat and frost." Bravo! And you? Want a drink? Drink? There's nothing there. Right, poor thing. I'll get you something You want a sip? - Yes, thank you. Are you happy, Engr Setti? Tony has passed. Even for conduct? - Conduct too. Good. I did it. I passed! Me too with full marks. - Good. Kids! I passed everything! Are we all here? Can I set the table? Maurizio's not here. Let's wait for him. Your mother would've been happy to be here with us tonight. With all her promoted children. That's Maurizio! How did it go? Dad, my first exam in Constitutional Law: Failed! Stop with the song and dance! You're breaking my balls with your bullshit! I want to know what's going on with my son! He was flunked. I asked Ernesto to give me a hand with these lunatics. Why are you here so early? I'm sick. I've a fever. Let me see. It's burning! This may be viral hepatitis. I had it too, I almost died. What is this party? - It's Paolo's birthday. My son? Damn it, I forgot. Hi, Tony! Tony, did you hear me? - Hi, Adriano! I'm going to bed. You want something warm? Close the door! Anna, come here! Hi, Dad. So you're sick? Yes, I'm sick. - You're not gonna die today, eh? It's your birthday. I know, I didn't forget. How old are you? - 16. Look in my jacket pocket. There must be a 100,000 lire. There's 200,000. Then take it. - Thanks, Dad. Happy birthday? Gina, call me a cab. - Right away, Doctor. Keep your hands to yourself and don't come in my room! Don't make such a fuss! Is it very serious? - Well, 39.8. Would you prefer a hospital or a clinic? What clinic? Hospital? I want to go to a quiet place where there's no noise! Who's there? The maid! The door is open! Elda? I thought I'd find you with a lady. What lady? I have a fever! I'm sick? - How high is it? 37. You call that a fever? - At home, it was more than 40. It's probably my nerves. Please, a nervous fever! I'll make your nervous fever go away! It'll be gone in 5 minutes, you'll see! I have the perfect remedy. Turn on the radio! Find Radio Tunisia! Why? You'll see! Don't be impatient! I found it! Turn it up! Louder! No, enough. Listen? I feel my fever rising. I'm ticklish! What are you doing? A 5 minute break. Did you like it? Very much. - Thank you. My daughter. - Congratulations, she's good. Did you see my partner? - Yes. What do you think? Isn't he divine? You want the truth? There's something about the boy that's? I knew it. You think everybody I love are thugs, married, losers or queers. Not one of them is good. You act like you're jealous. And if I were weaker, I would've been put in a convent by now. Wait a minute here, Francesca. These things are best nipped in the bud immediately. I know my daughter: She'll cry for a few months. Listen, why don't you tell her yourself? Fine, I'll tell her. I'm sorry, Francesca. - Me too. OK? - OK. We're all OK. OK? If there's anything I like about today's youth is their honesty. No mincing words: bread is bread, wine is wine. He's a homosexual. He says so. Beautiful. OK, Dad, let's go. Are you angry with Dad? - No. Shall I bring you home? I want to go to London. OK! Dad will bring you to London. My dear Francesca, at least perfect your English. Dad, you're the best. If you didn't exist, they'd have to invent you. This way. He's not here. One moment, I'll pass it. Adriano. Adriano! It's for you. Who is it? I'm in Munich! It's Gina. Gina? What does she want at this hour? - I don't know. Hello, Gina, what is it? Excuse me, I got this number from the phone book. They want you right away at the police station! It's Maurizio! They just called right now. Maurizio? What has that wretch done? Dottore, I'm sure it's nothing! I'm coming right away. Thank you. What happened? - Maurizio, my son. The police? Who knows what he's done? That wretch! Drugs, prostitutes? who knows? Maurizio, is that you? Maurizio. What have you been up to? Sorry. Hi, Dad. - Hi. Why don't I understand anything about you? Who beat you up like this? Get that newspaper, Dad. There's an article which begins in the middle of the page It's about a drug dealer. It has my signature. But you shouldn't have signed it but kept it anonymous. Anyway, signed or not signed, you have no idea, what joy you brought me tonight. Although I would've preferred to have found out at another moment. Come on, Dad. - I'm not reproaching you. You see, you never could know but? when I was young, I had a passion for writing too. But back then, if you wanted to be a journalist, you were considered a bit crazy. A failure, someone incapable of doing anything else. And my family you know? - I got it from you. I think so too. It could well be. Urgent message for Engr Setti: I have left suddenly for a photo safari in Kenya. I'll be back in 2 weeks. Kisses. P.S. I've already let Gina know. More kisses. You're in contact with Elda? I didn't ask for anything. She gave me her number. Because I mind my own business, as you know. Take Maurizio's case, for example, you yourself know it went well. Want me to go? - No, I'll get it. I bet that's Elda. Hello? Hey, English girl, how are you? How is the weather in London? In Paris? Something happened. There was somebody? I don't know how to explain it. I left him. Are you crying? He worked with the band. He did the lights. We all went around England together. Then we came here. Francesca, my God, have you lost your mind? Honey, stay there. Borrow some money from a boy? No, borrow it from a girl? No, don't borrow from anybody! I'll send it to you tomorrow! No, no? look I'll be there tomorrow on the first plane, OK? Fine, but stay where you are! Don't get into anymore trouble! Do you understand me, Francesca? Bye. Bye, Dad. I come and you go. You see how bad we've become? Won't you go to Paris with me? I don't have any time off and it would be annoying to meet your daughter in such a situation. It'd be unpleasant for everybody. And the idea of being shut up in a Paris hotel doesn't appeal to me. Alright. But don't do your disappearing act when I come back tomorrow. Roger, Captain! Tomorrow, I'll be here. But let's have some fun tonight. OK? Yes. Look! Look at that over there! Why? Isn't that one with the beard funny? Do you like it here? - Yes, an interesting place. A typical club. Nice. You want to dance? - My girl doesn't dance. Why? Because she doesn't. - Come with me. Oh, God, look at that! No, it's all an act. - Are you sure? Yes, the bar pays them. They do it every night. Don't be afraid. Do you have any documentation? - Yes, an ID card. Excuse me, I'm Dr Setti of the Lesange Pharmaceuticals. I have a plane to catch to Paris in a few hours, to go to my daughter who is very sick. You can tell the station that when you make your statement. Please, but can we hurry? That plane is leaving. Are you by yourself here? - Yes. No, I'm with a lady. Please, be seated. When your turn comes, we'll call you. I know but I can't wait because the plane isn't waiting for me and? Calm down now. - Yes? I can't calm down! I absolutely must? Do what you want, I'm leaving. Hey, stay here! - Don't put your hands on me. Are you new? - Excuse me? ID, Miss? - One moment, I'll check. Dad, what are you doing here? Maurizio, what are you doing here? My work is at the police station. You're lucky these are my friends. Hi, Maurizio. - Hi, this is my dad. You know each other? - Adriano? Excuse me, there's a problem: I have no ID. Ah, this is Elda. Maurizio, do something. She has no ID and I must go to Paris to see your sister. Sure, don't worry. - Don't you know them? Can my father go? - He may. Thank you. Very kind. Goodbye. Elda, come on. - You may go. Next. Have a seat. ID? Bye. See you tomorrow night. Bye! Elda! Walter! How nice to see you! Maurizio, come here. This is Walter. Hi! - My best friend. What are you doing here? - I came with a friend going to Paris. I flew to Paris where my Franesca, my favorite child, tried to commit suicide. But seeing Elda hug that young pilot, I forgot about everything, even the reason for my leaving. I thought of nothing else, until I arrived in confusion at the hostel. Sir? - Yes? I am Francesca Setti's father. I'll take you to her. Thank you. Come. This way. Down there. - Yes. There she is. Don't scold me, Dad. Please. This has been the only serious thing of my life. Don't cry. You had a tough time, eh? Can I ask you a question, man to man? With that electrician, did uh? was there? to sum it up? What happened? You understand me, right? Yes or no? Yes. Are you disappointed? Of course not. It happens sooner or later. I'm sorry it happened with a lying electrician. Dad, you can't understand. You don't know how he was. No, I do understand. I understand all too well. What do we do now? Are we returning to Milan? You have your passport? - Yes, here. Elda! Excuse me. Elda! Dad! Dad, wait for me! Dad! Dad, what's going on? Aren't we leaving? Come. Dad, why are you going back? It's a long story. I'll explain later. Do you understand? Thank you. No! Her name's Elda and I'm Adriano. Adriano, Elda. Please. She must call me right away at the Hotel Regina! OK? You understand? Thank you very much. You must be very in love with this Elda, hmm? Yes, I love her! Yes! Dad, look, I know you're waiting for an important phone call but? it seems silly to wait here with this lovely city outside. And stop swallowing sedatives! You've been waiting for 3 hours. It's not even dignified. And then, sorry, she won't be back before the stores close. Please, if I get a call by a certain Miss? a certain Miss Elda? wants me, tell her we'll be back when the stores close. Elda. Thank you. Is there a message for me, Miss? Thank you. She called twice. If it weren't for your whim to go shopping in Paris! What do you mean? - She called twice and you're an idiot! If she's no idiot, she'll call back. Else, sorry, but you're the idiot. Well, I know where to find her. Go, wear your best dress. I'll take you around Paris. Paris by night! Elda! Are you friend of Elda Manuzzio? Yes. Do you know where she is? She's rather far away. She had to leave suddenly for Acapulco and I don't know when she'll be back. Thank you. - You're welcome. This is Adriano. I'm in Milan. Please, call me as soon as you arrive. I'm begging you, don't make me suffer anymore. Anyway, we'll talk at the next Industry Confederation meeting. Goodbye, dear Gardini. Dad, I've made up my mind: No more men except you. Well done, my girl. You're right. Hi, Gina. - Sweetie, I was so worried. How are you, dear? Welcome back, Dottore. Anything new, Gina? - I'll tell you all. I don't know where Maurizio is and he never calls. Tony went on holiday to the sea with his friend from the first floor. Paolo is at Roberto's. He said they're going on a trip but I don't know where. Maria Luisa phoned yesterday, asking if you were back. She's going to the mountains with her husband. Anything else? I imagine you want to know about Elda? Don't imagine, tell me. She called and said she was going to South America. Did she say when she'd be back? She didn't. That's all. Here in Madrid is the headquarters, while in Barcelona, you can contact the Catalan branch. There are branches in Bilbao, in Sevilla. You can use my name but only as a last resort. I trust you, Roberto, because you're more serious. Thanks, but I still don't know if I'm going. Are you coming or not? I'm not. - Are you crazy? Yes, didn't you know? - Know what I think? I'm fed up with your "yesses" and "nos." Do what you want but I'm still going with Lucrezia and Luciana. What happened, Roberto? Why not go when you were so excited? No, Engineer, I don't like to travel in groups. Groups? It's just two boys and two girls. It's not a group. Besides, Spain doesn't interest me. Explain to me what you don't like more: A trip to Spain or the fact that there are four of you? Both. And I don't even know this Lucrezia. Say goodbye to Paolo. Goodbye. 15 YEAR OLD SUICIDE They'll say without any motive. Good in school, a close-knit family, loved by friends. But I knew you knew the truth, what the others could never even imagine. I understood by the way you spoke to me, when you said that maybe I wouldn't leave with your son? and with that girl. My feelings for Paolo are different than his feelings for me. And to keep on hiding them, has become too great a suffering. Please, never tell Paolo about this letter. Don't tell anybody what was written. You are the only one who understood. You began to understand that Sunday I waited for Paolo. I came in your house and we spoke for a bit. Goodbye. Keep this little secret. Thank you, Roberto. That's Paolo's breakfast. The milk is on the stove. You look elegant today. - Thanks. Where are you going? Lake Garda, to Ernesto's sister's house. Enjoy the Sunday. Say hi to the newlyweds! I will. Hi, Dad. Hi, Paolo. It happened that? he got up? while his parents were eating. He had just packed his luggage for Spain. He got up, went to the window, opened it up, and jumped down. Dad, don't ruin your summer here in Milan with me. Gina will help me. And soon Tony, Francesca and Maurizio will be back. I need to think. You cannot help me. I would like to understand why everyone can help you, in such a hard time for you, except me. He was a great boy, you know? I'm sure he wouldn't like to see you at this moment so? so closed off, so obstinate. Brother Giordano says the same thing. Who is Brother Giordano? A presbyter who gives spiritual help to catachumens. I'll think I'll go with them to seek out the poor in spirit. For a little while. I took refuge in my office, even on Sundays, to avoid the pitying looks of my maid. Hello? No, wrong number. This is not the pool. Ah, please explain to me, if Maria Luisa is on vacation in Bormio, when will she have the baby? It should be born in a month, month and a half. Maurizio bought a ticket to go on a long trip of Communist Europe? Yes. - Ex-communist. Thank God. Francesca is in Rimini with her aunt, and Paolo went to Lourdes? As a stretcher-bearer. - A stretcher-bearer? And you? My German class starts on the 20th. August 20th. And chess on the 30th. Why do you need a summer class? The last time, you put me into mate in 3 moves. Your generation's lack of professionalism is simply amazing. Dottore, if you want, I'll stay. No, thank you. This is your first holiday in 25 years. Where are you going with Ernesto? We wanted to go to Bulgaria because he is a communist but after all that's happened, we rented a room in Riccione. I'll leave my phone number. Please, don't come back pregnant. - I wish. Not happening. Take my advice: you go too. What are you waiting for? No, I'm a typical Milanese, Gina. The Milan air does me good. I'm a typical Milanese too. The two of us alone at Ferragosta in Milan. You'd like that? - Yes, a bunch. Don't go fall in love. - I'm not crazy. You never know. What's nicer than love? - Soccer is better! Who is it? - It's me, Dad. Maurizio. Where have you been? You've been gone a long time. I'll tell you later. Maurizio? Maurizio! Hello? - I just got back. Is that you? It really is you? Finally! I'd like to see you right away. Right away! Oh, Christ! We must turn the page, Adriano. I think it's best not to beat around the bush. I suffer, you suffer. And the end's always the same. I'm so sorry to death, as you can imagine but? I'm in love with another. And I don't like fooling you, acting the hypocrite. I think when the story is over, it's best to break off right away. Like you did with Massimo? - Yes. And who is my successor? Your co-worker from the airport? Why does it matter? Maybe there is no successor. I don't believe it. You weren't made to be alone. What is that? An insult? - No, a statement of fact, dear! You're like a butterfly: You need a mate. And if I told you that this time it's serious? No, I don't believe you. It's impossible. You're too independent. And who is this wretch doomed to be dumped? Do I know him? He is not doomed to be dumped, that I assure you. It's? It's Maurizio. Maurizo who? Maurizio. My son? Christ! It all started like a joke. One night, while you were at Paris, we saw each other. Then I flew to Paris, I knew you were looking for me and had called 4 times. Twice. Fine, twice. Then, Maurizio joined me in Madagascar, and we went to the Maldives together. It was there we realized this was serious. A bond had grown between us and we were in perfect harmony. What bond? What harmony? You fucked that's what you did! I did with him what I did with you. So? Then you're a whore! Women can't have feelings, eh? Just whores or madonnas? Don't talk shit! Both you and my son disgust me! Would you have preferred that I never told you? That we did it all behind your back? Yes, a 1000 times, yes! Better to be a cuckold than thrown away like an old rag! Adriano. I'm sorry. Did you say something? No. And him? It went badly? I knew I should've told him first. He's coming. OK, bye. You know she's 4 years older than you? You know she's been with tons of men? Not tons. Just 2. No? She told me everything, Dad. She was honest. She hid nothing. Did she say she was my lover? Did she tell you that? That too. Dad, Elda is an honest girl. She's good. Strong? like you. But you're in pain and I understand. Because the idea of losing a girl like Elda must be? What do you want me to do now? Kneel down before you? Don't you understand that you two are destroying my life? That you're killing me? No, Dad, I only want you to understand. Whatever you may do and whatever may happen? Elda is never going back to you. - No! Go?! Get out! No! Go away! Hello? Hello? Is that you, Dad? Maria Luisa! The flowers are from me! - Thanks! Look who's here! How beautiful? Are you going to cry? Come to mommy, sweetie. Don't cry. How ugly! - How cute! Dad, now you must take on your responsibility. You'll be his godfather and no excuses. No, don't even think about it. And he better not call me "grandpa!" And all of you better not either! OK, Grandpa! What a cutie! Isn't nice here? - Of course! More intimate. Like that night at Paris. Remember? How couldn't I? And the gypsies? We were madly in love. And then that terrible quarrel. Cheers. Shall we eat? - OK. There must be some antipasto or caviar. Where did that silly Gina put it? She probably forgot it. Strange. Maybe she ate it. OK, we'll find something else. We shall dine on pannettone and champagne. The gifts? - They're in the living room. Mine too? - No, here they are. They look great on you. Paolo. How could it be? Paolo! - Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas. This is Sister Berta. - Evening, Sister. I brought pannettone. - Thanks. And a bottle of holy wine. - Very kind. Excuse me, aren't you spending Christmas with? - My catachumens? But Sister Berta thought that? It'd be better to bring God into this home. Well, God will have to make do tonight because? we have nothing to eat. Excuse me, the bell's ringing. I'll be right back. Merry Christmas, Daddy. - Francesca! This is Dave. He played for the Boston Celtics. Now he's playing for Milan. Good evening. Hi, Valeria! Congratulations. You too. - Leave that here. Make yourselves at home. Come inside. Eh, look who's here. - Hi! This is Sister? - Berta! Berta. And what's your name? - Dave. Dave. You get it, please. I can't. I'm coming. Excuse me. What's going on? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Hi, Dad. Let me see him. Adriano Jr has made a mess. He wanted to spend Christmas with Adriano Sr at any cost. You brought pannettone? The very thing we needed! Would there be any tortellini in there? - No! Put it in the kitchen with Valeria. - May I come in, Valeria? Come in. I have a surprise for everybody! Look who's here! - The Baby Jesus! Well? What do you think? Easy! There's the baby boy! How beautiful. Gina! Where did you come from? I was in my room watching Grecia Colmenares on TV. Forget the poor blind girl and go in and help Valeria. She needs to set the table for 8, 9, maybe even 10 people. What is it? - It's Maurizio. I saw him through the window. He's coming up. Maurizio? - Yes. Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas, Maurizio. Just look: a pannettone. Thank you. How long has it been? 4 months. Why are you waiting there? Come in. You see? I don't know if I'll stay. You won't spend Christmas with us? I see. Bring her in. Elda! Hi, Elda. - Hi, Adriano. How are you? Still running around the world? No. I don't travel now. Come in. He's behaving well, right? My son Paolo, Sister? - Berta. Berta. And the latest boyfriend of? Francesca! Here she is: the black sheep of the family. Dad! - Somebody's ringing! You arranged all this, right? - No. Then, it was you? - No, Dad, I swear. Wow! - I am the champ! Tony! What a miracle! I'm Lalla Marchioli. I'm the official chaperon of the Italian Chess Federation. I brought back your champ. I thought you might like to have him for the holidays. This is the best Christmas gift! Come inside! Here is the champ! Give this lovely lady a kiss. Good. Eh, Mrs? - Miss. Miss Ma? - Marchioli. Marchioli. This is all my family. A pleasure. - Except her? and the Sister and? - It's ready! Ladies and gentlemen, come in. Dinner is served. Ah, Valeria, come here a second? I want to introduce you to? Elda. Hi, Elda. Well? Let's eat, OK? Let's sit down! You're our guest, of course. - Thank you. I'd love to. Gina! We're coming! Let's go. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and I make 11 Look at this masterpiece of a table! Who did it? Valeria, Gina and if I say so myself, me. Everybody here? - No. Maria Luisa isn't here. Here I am! Excuse me, but the kid just fell asleep. Now then, Valeria? - Shall I start cooking tortellini? Yes. - No, one moment. I've a surprise for everyone. Come on the terrace. A surprise on the terrace? What could it be? How beautiful! What a pretty tree! Who did it? Who did it? - The two of us did it. The two of us. Come on, guys, let's dance!
