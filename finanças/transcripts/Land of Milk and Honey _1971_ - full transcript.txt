Pierre Étaix, you just finished your fifth film, entitled... - Land of Milk and Honey. - An imaginary land? Hardly. It's France, the French. And you deal with themes new to you, like violence. Not sex and eroticism. It demanded a lot of work. Three months of shooting, seven months of editing. A lot of film. Twenty-five miles of film. 130,000 feet! How do you find your bearings? It just takes some order and method, and a good editor - Michel Lewin. No, keep at it. Don't you feel overwhelmed? Sometimes I feel attacked by the material. There's no end to it. When the film takes over, the problem's insoluble. It's a strange business, making decent people laugh. LAND OF MILK AND HONEY “Imaginary land of prosperity and abundance; a happy land where life is easy and pleasant.” BASED ON SCENES FROM REAL LIFE A FILM CONCEIVED AND DIRECTED BY... It's long been said France is a land of milk and honey, no doubt because of the natural wealth of its soil... but also the exceptional diversity of its landscapes, the result of its privileged geographic situation. Bathed by four seas, surrounded by long, snow-capped mountain chains, which, at the appearance of the first chill, delight the sports-minded among us... but also by green slopes that benefit our horned bovines, lending our dairy products their unique quality. Crisscrossed by majestic rivers and wild waterways, France offers us many unexpected faces. However... the blessing of nature is nothing without man's ordered efforts. These vestiges of the past tell the story of our forefathers. They harbor many secrets. Later, new architectural forms will in turn relate contemporary history, but they too will harbor many secrets. Yet, though man still seeks to improve on France's natural structures, he also seeks to enjoy in peace the beauty of places he has yet to dominate. And when vacation time comes, like a snail carrying his shell, he sets off on the road, towing his house on wheels, knowing that wherever he stops, there will always be cause for wonder... culture... and even - why not? - a little fun. These youngsters in folk dress uphold age-old traditions, traditions gradually giving way to the modern step of these charming majorettes. Since the Middle Ages, public displays have retained their appeal. Today there are still itinerant performers. In summer, Molière's disciples erect their platforms in public squares. Amateur singers have replaced Philaminte and Scapin, but gentlemen and yokels alike flock to them. Their show provides cultural nourishment. So look and listen... Look at me good What do you think? You should have seen me Dance the Charleston People would fight just to get close Look at me good What do you think? You should have seen me Dance the Charleston When I was 30 In Cannes, at the Carlton No father to watch me right When Mama went to work at night I played guitar sitting on the stoop My fist clenched, my thirst unquenched For I was born in the gutter... Next! Let him sing! Pierre Étaix... you see... this is my first time on-stage. Not the first, but the first time on Europe 1 radio. And you see, I sang a song. Did you find my voice good or bad? Good. In the middle of a song, the public whistles. Naturally, that interferes with the sound of the mic, so you can't hear the singer. So I stopped and picked up the song a few minutes later. And then... I think the public was happy with my song. What do you think about man walking on the moon? We'd all love to go, but it's a problem. Why is it a problem? There aren't rockets comfortable enough to go up there. But you think it's interesting? What do you think? What do I think? I haven't gone yet. Do you find it useful, necessary, interesting, brave? Well, I think it takes a real athlete to go there. I think that heart patients can forget it. What do you think of the current wave of eroticism? What? Eroticism. For or against? “Eroticism”? I didn't finish school. I don't know that word. Eroticism? Your opinion of this omnipresent wave of eroticism? I think... it's normal. Obviously, it's a matter of opinion. Eroticism? It's dirty. I don't know. You joke about it with the guys. That's what eroticism is. It's not bad. Gotta try it, as they say. Eroticism? I'd rather go bang a chick. Wouldn't you? Wanna know something? It's healthy, man. It's hygiene. Just looking at chicks on pinups makes you laugh, okay, but if that's eroticism, it's no big deal. Go ask the clientele. Any product has to be mouthwatering. Especially with sex. All you do is show some ass. An ass speaks for itself. Everyone likes ass, unless you're a total moron. Even if a guy says he's against it, that it's scandalous, it still gets shown. He'll still get off seeing it. That's the problem. Sure, in France we had a fairly religious upbringing for a long time. Not puritanical, but fairly religious. So its normal if people are a bit shocked. It's not part of their way of thinking, what they were taught originally. But I think the more we see, the less shocked we'll be. No problem. It's good to know a little about it. Our parents and grandparents surely didn't know enough. You see asses all over. It's not erotic. It's vile and disgusting. We see too much of it. It's unacceptable. Then guys start giving you funny looks. It's not funny at all. But eroticism isn't sex. You're erotic or you're not. My feeling is that women are nice to look at. I don't mind them showing their breasts. It's normal to like a nice ass. You take what you can get. There are so many things I'm against that that's not where I'd start. Anybody who doesn't want to look can hide his eyes. It's totally ridiculous. There are other satisfactions in life than eroticism. By definition... I'm not for eroticism. They say eroticism can be enriching. I never bothered to find out if it could indeed be enriching. Yesterday, for the first time, I even bought an erotic novel: Two Men in a Bed. I don't even know the author. Okay, I figure it might not shock me, but brute eroticism is shocking. It robs the individual of the deep, personal instincts of human and sexual responses, since generally eroticism is just a step away from sexuality. The wave of eroticism you mention is something that has been carefully prepared for centuries, and we can now say it's not a bad thing. It's even a good thing. We can also talk about homosexuality, the disease of the century. What can one say about all that? To each his own. I'm a little embarrassed. We are losers, beggars not choosers While those damn bourgeois have all the fun If being in their good books is where you're at! Go out and get a clean collar and a soft hat A cap makes you look A bit like a crook So when a bourgeois looks you in the eye He says with a cry... They're losers. They're just waiting for retirement. Their heads are empty. I wonder what they talk about together. What could a conversation between them possibly be like? Must be incredible. How can any woman marry a cop? With a little love, a little kindness, we can obtain a lot more than with violence, beatings and all that. I think we must avoid domestic scenes. The clashes, the violence, the yelling. We have to live in harmony with everyone around us. We don't have to make war with one another. I'm appalled to see violence. When you're a man in the full sense of the word, it goes counter to the education our parents theoretically gave us. No, I'm not for violence. I'm for conversation. I might be for verbal violence. You're a gentleman too, right? And when we speak of violence, let's not forget that it costs astronomical sums, which in the end we all have to pay for. Violence nowadays is all we see in the streets, in wars. Violence in love, at times, might not be unpleasant. These scenes of violence are unacceptable. It's a real lack of education. It's a return to the primitive state, to bestiality. MESH Whereas with a bit of kindness, you can be understanding. I think it's the best result. Why would the police beat someone up, for instance? Even here, if someone touches you, I'd jump him. I'm not for violence. I fought in all the wars. Seven years in Indochina. I've been everywhere. I'm an ex-soldier, decorated. But I'm not for this violence. I just received My military papers To go to war By Wednesday evening Sirs, whom we call great, I do not want to go I wasn't put on earth To kill poor folks I'm all for protest songs. When someone has the courage of his opinions, that's a fine thing. They were tens, hundreds, they were thousandfold Naked and thin, trembling, in the sealed boxcar cold Their fingers beat and tore at the walls of the night They were thousands, hundreds, they were tenfold Once they were men, now they were only numbers Their fates had been sealed long ago Once the hand falls only the shadow remains Never would they see A summer's day again Time fled, monotonous and slow Could they survive one day more, one hour, they didn't know How many turns of the wheel, how many stops and starts That never stopped filling them with hope in their hearts I'm not against the artist who sings naturally Without expressing & political opinion. The hardest thing... It isn't working very well. I sing at home when there's no one around, when Morn isn't there. Give her a chance. Come on. Actually, some of them are dumb to whistle. They could ask questions at the mike, to see if the singer sang well or not, not whistle. You don't know where you stand. There are no judges, so we don't know if our voice was good or if the public liked it. In terms of music, I like jazz, classical music, of course... jazz, pop - all types. A warm hello from the GAN caravan. The National Insurance Group and Europe 1, and our friend Bibi, Maurice Biraud, here for the Tour de France, greet you and wish you a good day. Your friend Bibi, whom you listen to every morning from 10:00 to 12:00. Say, are you in love with me? That's sweet. Would I like to be a star? I don't know. You're famous, sometimes even admired. I don't know. I guess if I were a star and people asked for autographs, I'd give them to them. But if I choose this profession over another, out of love, I think I'd submit to what I had to do. I'd compromise my principles. You have to live with your choices. Compromising my principles means things that are deemed dishonest in some circles or situations, but if you choose showbiz, you have to surrender principles. That's what I think. You have to compromise all your principles. All of them? Do you realize what you're saying? I don't agree. Some are possible. Others I wouldn't accept. I'm the sentimental type, but I have certain principles. Some compromises are certainly valid. There are experiences I haven't had that are worth trying. Like, I won't sing just anything and ruin my voice. I'd like to make a name for myself as a singer, a fairly big name, like as & follow-up to Johnny Hallyday. It would be a new age, the age of Pierrot the Child, Wit & new wave for the young people. Pierrot the Child is a nickname that at first glance seems simple, but behind that nickname... behind that nickname... lie certain mysteries, certain riddles, so to speak. But these riddles - Like a Lamartine come back to earth. Like Robespierre in that he's a man of the people, a man who stands up for the people and for things that are really necessary these days, because some things have really been neglected, like water pollution, air pollution, the problem of feeding people, and certain flagrant injustices. Pierrot the Child tries to convey all that in song, to make people understand he's with them. Then Pierrot would like to go into theater. If you want people to take an interest in theater, you can't give them Brecht all the time. Personally, I like Brecht, but they want entertainment too. I like war movies, westerns, romantic movies... and SOS 117... James Bond. Do you think that violent movies are bad for young people, or doesn't it matter? If they're not rated R, or show women half - what word can I use? - not too forward or sexy, that can be educational. For the moment, movies practically don't exist. I like to see relaxing, funny shows. COME SEE MY CIRCUS Camping is Trigano Camping is Trigano Those are friends of mine on vacation. That's Trigano Those are friends of mine on the weekend. That's Trigano Now I go on vacation with Trigano. Camping is Trigano PRIVATE CAMPGROUND ROAD NO EXIT NO CAMPING NO DUMPING The regulations require, one: Dogs are allowed on the campground, provided they are kept on a leash or tied up. On a leash or tied up in the tents. Because there have been complaints. Second: Young people sometimes make noise, but it's no big deal. Are people ever dissatisfied? Some are. I usually make the rounds daily, except these past few days. They don't complain about sanitation. They complain if a trailer or tent has been set up next to them, so they demand their 1,000 square feet. Here we require, theoretically, that the tent, if not of the same family... that they have 1,000 square feet, so they can park their car next to their tent. We do everything we can to make them comfortable. But often... there are several tents belonging to the same family. So they're cramped, but it's not our fault. Another cause of dispute that I have with some is they take up too much space. So since I make my rounds regularly, daily, I have to tell them, “Move in closer. You're exceeding your allotted space. You get 1,000 square feet. No more.” People say they're on top of each other. They complain that life will be impossible. I try to give them another space. It all works out in the end. When I point it out, people say they don't have 1,000 square feet. Today we had to turn away a number of people, even some Germans who've been coming here seven years. - Why? No vacancy. Some people were camping without facilities for 17 years. They're here. And they come daily. They have their designated space, and we can't move them. They've been here 17 years. Why do you think they come back? They like the area, the climate, I don't know. It's hard to define. The train goes through here? It doesn't run often. Or it does, in the busy season. It runs frequently during the day. The last one's at 10:00 p.m. The first one's at 6:30 a.m. Lovely Venice May have its vast lagoons Its carnival masks Daggers and palaces Brittany, haven't you your brown peasant lasses Your shaggy-haired sons and fields of broom Oh, how beautiful my Brittany is Under gray skies you must see it to believe It is more beautiful than Spain Which awakens only in the eve More beautiful it is Than Venice Whose façade is mirrored in the seas How gentle it is to feel the breeze That wafts in With the waves Vacation is great. It's great to be among friends and have a good time. For having slept so often With my solitude She's almost a friend now A tender habit She never leaves me Faithful as a shadow She's followed me here and there To the four corners of the world No... I'm never alone With my solitude A beach where you're on top of each other - it's awful, horrible. If people from the projects have no means of escape, for me it's the same as at the seaside in August. People don't like living there. They have to live in those high-rises, but no one likes them. I have two godsons who live in high-rises. One lives in Nanterre, the other in Villeneuve-la-Garenne. They don't complain. They're quite comfortable. It's very decent housing. One of my godsons is about - They're about the same age. No, one's a bit younger. One's 42, married, no children. The other one's 36 and has two children. They're very comfortable. They have everything they need. I won't say they wouldn't like to live someplace else, especially the one in Villeneuve-la-Garenne. Nanterre's not the same. It's more spacious. They have more fresh air, if you like, more space to see. Maybe in the future they'll build something better, more pleasing to the eye. For instance, when we go to our little country house near - When we arrive on the highway, and we see those awful things, how they're designed... of course you want to run away. It makes me sick. But my two godsons don't live in rabbit hutches. Another thing I find terrible is how they ruin the landscape with their towers. Look. Isn't that charming, all those big things sprouting up? They don't look nice. They look awful. Those big piles make me sick. Conditioning people... I'm rather for it, in that those who escape it are stronger than the others. But most people can't escape it. Advertising, critical reviews... it's everywhere in the street, in the papers. Everything's financed by advertising. I'm easily influenced, as I said, but people who escape its pull deserve credit. I won a transistor radio and a bottle of wine. What's your opinion of advertising? It's good because it helps sell things. - What's good? - Advertising. It helps sell things. We'll simply put them at the table face to face for the tournament. I won't criticize their table manners. With a blindfold, it's very hard. Three minutes have gone by. Time's up! We'll give you 10 points each. You deserve it! Thank you for participating. You were fantastic! You believe in advertising? What's that? Advertising. Advertising is something very commercial. If you have lots of capital, you're likely to succeed and make your mark in that sense. Advertising has become truly indispensable today. But I'd like to point out that if there weren't so many posters, like for the president - If there weren't all this useless advertising, at least regarding posters, those billions could be spent on other things. These posters might shock some people because, as Malraux said, eroticism is not accepted as a value by everyone. HE KEEPS HIS PROMISES Advertising on walls is all over the place. You can't take it all in. What a headache! Advertising is - It's mainly to - Advertising is just a way of disguising capital. That's all advertising is. I consider advertising a lesser evil. If you don't do it like everyone else, you're at a disadvantage. DEVALUATION: STIMULATION AND AUSTERITY PLAN IN A GOOD MOOD There used to be 65 of us. Now there are 35, including 12 musicians. It's tough. We perform all the time. When the elders quit or die off - No one will take their place. Plenty have gone already. What interests youth? I don't know. Ask the soccer club president. He has no more than I do. Kids! You do? Maybe they prefer soccer. Why? Music is too much bother. You can run around on scooters, but not play music. It's too complicated. The musical mentality is missing. My drug is white or red wine, but I'd prefer drugs. They're less harmful. If people like drugs, why not? MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR I admire those who work in summer camps. Come on! Wow! Great! Fame is just around the corner! Come on, sweetie. Here's Professor Calculus. It's good for kids to be with me, to shine my shoes. Their vacation is mine too, so I may as well enjoy it. I live in the projects... so I know how it is: When the kids are gone, there's no one to slap around. So they're bored. At least that's the feeling I get. I've been going camping for 17 years. And I can see the kids are... really in their element. Relaxed. They love the campground. For children, it's a way of being with friends. It's easier to make contact. Camping is a good thing... for your health, and for the kids. For the kids and everyone else, of course, but health-wise - Camping sucks! Look, a fire. Are you well-insured? GAN, the National Insurance Group, thinks of everything: fire, water damage, even risks you haven't thought of. GAN thinks of everything for you. GAN... National Insurance Group, thinks of everything. For your summer fun, GAN and Europe 1 planned a contest: the French greasy pole championship. It's all planned for you. There's a lot of dancing and good times. GAN thinks of everything for you. For your summer fun, GAN and Europe 1 planned a contest: the French greasy pole championship. It's all planned. GAN thinks of everything for you. Do you believe in advertising? Do you think it's effective? Sure, why not? What is GAN? Do you know what GAN is? It's the greasy pole test May the winner be the best The firemen will give their all We'll have a good laugh as they fall We'll see who is the best of all At the firemen's ball Who will win the ham? Which lucky fireman? Which lucky fireman? Lieutenant, how are you? How's the lieutenant? - Just fine. - Our five champions? - The five champs are here. Were they hard to pick? No, we had 30 to choose from. Out of 30! So here we have the very best. And now, our five champions are ready. Look out! Here comes the starting signal. And he's off! Fantastic! Quick, quick! Great! Fantastic! Cheer him on! Great! Cheer him on, everyone! Go, go! He did it! Go for it, Jean-Pierre! Cheer him on, everyone. That's quite a feat! There! Give him a hand, for heaven's sake! Isn't it great? Thanks to all you firefighters for coming in uniform. Thank you. You're very kind. The vacationers are having fun. Good for them. They're on vacation. They should have fun. What's vacation for me? A little rest, which is the usual aim of vacation, but also a change of pace. We're harassed by current events, and we're forced to keep up. But being interested is different. On vacation... it's the least of my worries. When there's something big in the news, it's always distressing. No, nothing happened during my last vacation that was particularly newsworthy. EARTHLINGS WALKED ON THE MOON That? It's nice that they walked on it. It's a big discovery, but personally, I really don't care. What do you think of the event? I think it's very good. It's the future. A total success. It's not bad, but other things need to be done, before walking on the moon. Without being reactionary. Famine, for instance, is disgusting. There's no other word. I've never studied economic policy. I'm an upholsterer. But if something needs reforming, it's people's morals. They need a conscience. They need to be given a conscience and some morality so that they respect one another. They throw garbage around. I recall the war, when we were starving. It's not funny. Sometimes I throw food away because I miscalculated, but I throw out very little. But even that's wrong. You have to take only what you need. The surplus, since it'll get thrown out, should go to the poor - but that's dreaming. For us, there's no famine in France. In the world, we think about it. When there's a fund-raising drive, we pitch in. You have to try to help people. That's very important. Famine's in the news again. Our lifestyle is certainly different from the Biafrans'. We live in a world of overproduction. We have to advertise, or we'll croak too. Advertising should be for lots of things, like informing people. Information, not brainwashing. There's too much hype. Some things require hype, but they should save it for healthy things, for people. They hype things like food with enzymes. They'll come at you with “Mrs. Fancypants uses Zigzag suppositories” over and over. That's all very well, but it's total hype. You know, Goebbels during the war was in advertising for Hitler's regime. I have nothing against advertising. I'm not a reactionary. I'm not against everything. But advertisers, with all the potential they have, could sometimes run an ad against famine in Biafra, or the war. Famine concerns me, but since I can't do anything, others have thought about it more. If they do that rather than fight famine, it's their business. I'm appalled, but what can I do? Famine in the world? Let the bigwigs handle it, with a little help from the people. It's not up to them to do it while we do nothing. I'm willing to help. Just tell me what to do. I'm no pioneer researcher. Famine is awful. It shouldn't exist today. We go to the moon while others starve. What do you think about men walking on the moon? I don't know. So they walked on the moon. I don't think much of it. What do you think? I don't know. You find it interesting? Don't know. Walking on the moon is fine, but why? I guess. You think it's useful? I tell you, I don't know. I don't know. It depends on your viewpoint. I don't think so, but my brother says it's a great step, that they'll surely discover things. So it's useful that they're doing it. It's also a technical feat... from a human standpoint. I don't know if you saw it, but watching it on TV, it was really moving. - Do you have a TV? - No, I don't. No. We don't have one. My husband's anti-TV from head to toe. Because the programs are usually very stupid. Some people, once they get a TV, can't stop watching. They sit in front of their TV from morning to night and never go out. One of our friends goes to dinner at another of our friends'. He says it's awful. They'd turned the table around so they could all watch TV while they eat. I'd rather talk about other stuff. When we get together, it's to talk about interesting things without having your nose in front of a screen. They talk about nothing but TV. “I saw this on TV.” Or, “I saw this, I saw that,” and they tell you everything from A to Z. I didn't want a TV, but I bought one to be up to date. And I'd do it again. I've caught the bug now, the bug of watching that crap, in fact. Lolling in my armchair, watching. Now I'm hooked. I sit there and get my middle-class fix, but I think it's all crap. I watch TV for entertainment. It distracts me. That's all. After 15 years of marriage... we don't have much to say. It depends. It's a problem for young couples, 20-25, even 30, because they'll watch TV and stop paying attention... to anything else. But for a couple in their 50s, even over 40, ifs okay, they have nothing left to say. I've always considered marriage an unnatural institution. This is a bachelor talking. As Sacha Guitry once said, women are made for marriage, men aren't. You work it out. Animals show us how unusual we human beings are, chaining ourselves to one person all our lives. A creature is not made to spend its whole life with another. Lovers can marry. Marriage is a concretization. I'd accept a marriage between two men or two women. Let's not go too far. I like a bit of fun, but there are limits. Humanity must survive. The Lord said, “Be fruitful and multiply.” Don't expect me to contradict him. Life must go on. To me, marriage is sacred. The state invented marriage so people could sleep together. If, after a while, people stop loving each other, it's almost like adultery. They interfere with our free will. All these conventions, these stupid laws, are man-made. God didn't say, “Do this, do that.” God gave us freedom. As for me personally, my wife, after 10 years, has gained emancipation, so she has her own activities, and with respect to society, she fulfills clear responsibilities, but the downside of this evolution is that the feminine personality loses its lighthearted and almost romantic nature. So much for femininity. You have to uncover it, rediscover it, find it where you'd least expect it. They lost all femininity when they put on pants. They're wrong trying to be man's equal. They aren't made for that. For them to become man's equal, or accept a certain function, is a liberation for women, not an obstacle to femininity. I think even women execs are still feminine. It doesn't bother me. Sooner or later in life, a woman becomes feminine, very feminine. If you compare two women, the mature woman compared to the young chick, you want the mature woman, not the young chick. I'm not thinking of love with an experienced woman, sexually, I mean. I don't mean sentimentally. I see many women with great responsibilities, starting with my own wife. She's no less feminine. Our wives go regularly to the hairdresser. Some even have beauty care as well. For the younger ones, it's not even a question. Girls today wear makeup and do their hair. But men are only just starting. We're starting to see hairdressers for men where you don't ask for a quick shave and a trim. You get more care: shampoo, hair spray, and so on. If you think about it, a man too has a right to an evolution in the sense of aesthetics and fashion, which, like I said, has changed a bit recently, but it's just a start. We're not perfect, but I hope it'll come. We started three years ago. Some work, others are in school. We rehearse every Sunday. They come as often as possible. We rehearse an hour a week. It's carnival all yearlong! You can't keep people from dressing up, from laughing. Laughter is man's special gift. You think they're having fun? I think they look bored stiff. Those kids aren't having fun. I know they have different concerns than when I was young. These days we lead a crazy life. We're stressed, pulled left and right by all the noise. Humor helps us grin and bear it. Life is hard for everyone these days, so you need a sense of humor in difficult moments. That might be a lot to ask of people. Who doesn't have problems? Some people look for trouble too. As long as you're healthy and look at the bright side of life... You don't need to joke around all the time. We can have nice talks. I rather enjoy your questions. I understand them. But it's not essential to joke around all the time. We can have pleasant conversations without it being humorous. I wouldn't attend an actor's funeral... but I'm glad they entertain and distract me. Do you know this definition of humor? I think it was Bernard Shaw who said, “Humor is the politeness of despair.” Humor... is having the right quip at the right moment. The French language has the finest humor, because the French are funny. I know lots of foreigners. They're not as funny. And the French language is suited to it. I love your big feet that smell of cheese Like the grated cheese I take in my soup, please The French generally enjoy a good quip. A guy without wit isn't funny. That's for sure. There aren't comics like before the war. Not like before, that's for sure. It's the fault of the young. Anyone can go on-stage these days and get applause. They have less fun than we do. That's for sure. Look how they dance. Their dancing isn't French. They copied the Americans. We're not Anglos. We're Latin. I find the Americans very dynamic. Not like us. We're not dynamic. In my day, dancing was soothing and lascivious. It was considered a prelude to love. It wasn't exercise. Dancing today is different. It's uninteresting. It's physical exercise. It's exercise, it's gymnastics, whatever you like, but not dance. Anyone who gets up on-stage is a hit. Our friend is going to do a paso doble. What's extraordinary is that he won't sing it. He won't dance it. He won't whistle it. He won't clap it out. Don't tell me you're thinking of another part of his body. He'll do it, folks... with his nostrils. Yes, I said nostrils. With castanets in his nostrils. I'll leave you to perform this marvel. - Nothing. - Nothing in his pockets. So get ready. And listen carefully to his nostrils. It's really something. And when you have a cold - - It's the same. - The same? - How do you do it? - With my nose. - Your nose? - Yes, sir, my nose does the work. Your nose does the work. Some people like Pierre Étaix's dialogue, others don't. He's a comic who's - A physical comic. It's very difficult. I like it. You know, I think comedy is even more difficult than tragedy. That's humor. I must say I never bothered to define the word “humor.” It's often based on wordplay. You don't agree? Why not? Like punning. You love it or you hate it. People react differently. Pierre Étaix's humor is the way he expresses himself. Étaix... that rings a bell. It rings a bell. I've heard the name. I've heard of him. He's a director. Isn't he a little avant-garde? Didn't he do Circus Angel? No, I tell you. Hang on. You sure he's a film director? Pierre Étaix? Yes, I know of him. I find him a bit juvenile. That's all. A bit juvenile. His gags are a bit juvenile. It's not a type of humor everyone likes. It doesn't strike you as hilarious right off. There's a certain originality, and that's interesting. Movies should be seen as entertainment, but also as personal expression. That guy expresses himself in a rather peculiar style. I wouldn't want to go see him every week, but it's not unpleasant. The nice thing about his films is he's the one who performs, and he has the right physique for his role. His movies are very human. It's very light material handled with sensitivity and tenderness. That's what I've read, anyway. He's actually rather subtle. He doesn't overdo it. It's rather light, witty. That's my opinion, anyway. What's this Pierre Étaix? What an eye, her buttock's soft, her nipple dares The other nipple, eye, buttock make the pairs But you can't say she's monotonous And even when autumn is upon us I shout when I see her: Here comes spring fever! Marcelle, if I had wings, well, I'd make them swell Marcelle To fly to my belle The other damsel I couldn't resist her: your kid sister! There... that's Pierre Étaix. - Is that all? - Yes. YES... THAT'S ALL.
