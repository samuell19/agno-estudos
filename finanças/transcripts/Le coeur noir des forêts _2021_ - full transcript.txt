Thank you. - Goodbye. Thank you. - Bye. Hello, Camille. Welcome. Here, this is her whole case file. Thank you. Right... Camille, please. We could start by going to the sea for a week, with the whole family. We've got a house there. It's huge. You'll have a room to yourself. Nikolaï? Can I come in? Come on. It's only for a week. It's mentoring support. It'll be nice to leave this place, won't it? I'm not ten anymore! - Just go and talk to them. - And say what? I already told you, I no longer want to join a family. It'll help you prepare for independence. You know we won't be here for you in two years' time. Then let me handle things on my own. Nikolaï. Sleeping rough isn't handling things. What's the risk in it? Think about it, OK? Right, pencils down, books down, it's game time. The Werewolves is starting. Are you going to play? Here. Everyone to their seats. Could you turn the music off? We're starting. Go on, sit down. Can't we play something else? Like Monopoly? Wanna play? Come. It's crap! It's always the same thing, all day, every day. - Calm down. - Shush. - Camille, wanna play with us? - Don't say what you got. Thanks. Right, hold on, let me just get through. Here you go, Camille. Night falls on the village. Villagers, go to sleep. Close your eyes. But at night, the werewolves wake up. Wolves, wake up. Recognise yourselves. Point to someone who will die tonight. Wolves, come to an agreement. The wolves can go to sleep. The village wakes up. You can open your eyes again. Apart from one person. One person died last night and that person is... Adam. Give me your card. Right. There are wolves amongst you. - Who are they? - I think it's Héloïse. I guess you already know all about me. Apart from the weed thing, we know nothing. - We also know you had an abortion. - Shut up! It's fine. How did you end up here? They said it was this or a detention centre. Be cool to your caretaker and you'll do fine here. But we're in the middle of nowhere. What do you do to relax? We're allowed to go to a bar nearby. It's a bit of a dump, but it's good fun. Some people wanna fuck too. - Shut up. - C'mon, it's a joke. What about you? He scours the forest. You all right, Mowgli? Come on. You respect the rules? Yeah. They want us to handle stuff on our own here, like getting to class and meals on time, and not getting into trouble outside. Adam, come tidy up. Stop goofing off. Can I finish my cigarette? - Where should I put it? - Over there. Do you always look at the new girls like that? Since I got here, you've given me a creepy stare. No, it's a normal stare. You're not gonna murder me? Of course not. I'm joking. - The others always pick on you, right? - They find it funny. Why do they call you Mowgli? For no reason. - What's your name? - Nikolaï. - What? - Nikolaï. Have you been to other homes? - No, just this place. - Damn. - Aren't you sick of it? - Well, yeah. What are you listening to? Come on, guys, no loafing about. Right. Bye, then. - Goodnight. - Me too. You too. Whose place is this? No one's and everyone's. Here. - Are your parents in these? - No. My parents died in a car accident when I was very young. I was in the car, but I survived. That's rough. Sorry. My mum changed her mind after she saw me. And I see my dad once a year. I don't care, it suits me fine. - Do you bring the others here? - Who? The other girls. I've never brought anyone here. Yeah, right. Your stars should go on the ceiling. Look. Camille. Camille. Come on. It's time. We have to go. Listen. You sure about this? But close your eyes and really listen. There's nothing there. You have to be patient. - Isn't this nice? - I dunno. This is kind of freaky. You'll see, it's so impressive when they roar. Can I ask you something? Why didn't you keep your baby? I had no choice. Would you rather have kept it? Yeah. Let's go? I would've liked to be the father of your child. What? Don't you want to start over? With you? If you wanna sleep with me, you could just ask. You don't have to answer right away. I barely know you. So what? Who cares? Where would you make this baby? If you have one, it'll go into care like us. We'll go as far into the forest as possible. I know places. - Zia, is it clean? - Yeah, it's clean. Hurry up, damn it. Get a fucking move on, you slackers! Don't leave it there. - What are you doing? - Leave me alone. - I'm not doing it for you. - I said leave me alone. We'll get rid of that. It's useless, anyway. Still want that baby? What's going on? What are you doing here? We found these pills in Camille's belongings. Did you take any? You know I don't touch that stuff. - Do you know where they came from? - No. What were you doing in her room? Nothing. Are you in a sexual relationship? I told you nothing happened. Are you aware of the risks you're taking? There are lines that must not be crossed. You've known the rules for a long time. What if there was an accident? It wouldn't be an accident. Did anyone see you? No. Here. Take this. Don't you like it? What do we do about the home? I got Jeremy to say we're visiting your mum. My mum? Nobody knows where she lives. That'll keep them busy. Why did you leave with me if you don't want to? I don't know. Give me some time, OK? Do you like it? We're going to freeze. Did you hear that? Listen. Yeah, it's a forest. Thanks. POLICE - Goodbye. Thank you. - Bye. - Here, this is her whole case file. - Thanks. Right. Camille, please. I'll leave you to it. Right. Given your behaviour and case file, you're lucky to be with us. But, to be clear, you're on trial here. One step out of line and you'll go back to court. Is that clear? - Yeah. - Good. Camille, wanna play with us? Fantine, get the chair, please. Thanks. - Here. - Here you go. Have a seat. Have you played before? Night falls on the village. The villagers go to sleep. But the wolves get up at night. Point to someone who will die tonight. Wolves, come to an agreement. - Zia, is it clean? - Yeah, it's clean. C'mon, hurry up, damn it! Don't leave it there. - What are you doing? - Leave me alone. I'm not doing it for you. I said leave me alone. Hey. You got my money? I've got to be careful. Then what did I come for? For me. Wait. - When are we seeing each other? - I dunno. - Tell me so I can make arrangements. - Soon. - This weekend? - No, I won't be here. I'll call you. I'll see what I can do. It's your fault I'm here. I have to go, Camille. A cigarette, please. Adam wants some of your pills. - Did you tell him how much it was? - Yeah. He asked to pay in sexual favours. - What an idiot. - He makes me laugh. So, what's going on between you two? What does Nikolaï want? Nothing. Come off it, I can tell something's going on. It's your call, but I've always thought he was odd. Why? I dunno. He's not ugly or anything, but... I dunno. You know his story about his parents dying is bullshit. - Yeah? - He was abandoned. Zia saw his file. She said he was found in the forest. - Really? - Yeah. It makes sense he's a weirdo. Yeah. But it's your call. There's nothing going on. We just talk. You coming with us to the fair? No. I'm gonna veg out here. That's dumb, we got the night free. I'll let you know. Yeah, come. Camille? What are you doing here? I wanted to talk to you. You're not allowed here. What did I do? You haven't spoken to me in three days. Leave me alone, Nikolaï. Go away. You're going to get me into trouble. I can help if you're not OK. No. Please, just fuck off. - Yeah? - It's me. - Why are you here? - I have to see you. I told you not to come here. You stopped answering. We have to talk, it's important. I don't have much time, can you let me in? No, I can't. Yeah, but I'm pregnant again. Come on! Open up or I'll break down the door. Don't play those games, Camille. Look, we were just fooling around. Don't make a scene and just leave. Open the fucking door! Did Nikolaï force you to do anything? No, he didn't do anything. It was me. - What do you mean it was you? - Nothing. We've set up an appointment with the judge for you. What's the point? And the pills... What's the point? It's not what you think. But you know what this means for you. Sorry. You've left me with no choice. Don't do this to me. I'll change. Camille, we're here for you, but we can't accept any old behaviour. Especially if you put yourself in danger. I'll change. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah. Yeah, it's me. Can I... I don't mean to bother you, but... can I talk to my dad? Dad? No, nothing. Everything's fine. Yeah, honestly. Could we meet up? Yeah, just because. Why not? I just wanna see you, that's all. Already? Yeah, it's nice. No, I didn't get any picture. Yeah, it's... Yeah, that's true, I... I still have the old one, but it works fine. I don't need money. I... I wanted to hear your voice and... see when we could meet up. I know, it's fine. No, nothing. No, it's fine. It's... It's a little out of the way, but no worse than the others. Everything's fine. It's all good, I got this. That's good, right? Anyway... We'll speak over the holidays. Yeah. Take care. Bye. Shouldn't you keep lying flat on your back? We should do it again until we're sure. We'll see, OK? What? Can I ask you a personal question? Why did you say your parents died in a car crash? Cos that's what happened. Weren't you found in the forest? You don't have a clue. I don't mind. It's beautiful you're a child from the forest. Even though you've had it rough, you got parents. You know where you're from. I had nothing. I was just left there like a dog. Move, Niko. Niko. Find the right tree, the one that calls to you, walk over to it. Let it know you're there. Go on, do it, please. Press your ear up against it. Ask a question and listen. Well? I dunno. Close your eyes. It's getting risky on the farms, I'm gonna get caught. We said we'd always save some for a rainy day. - Give it here! - No! - Give me the cake! - Give it back! If I eat, the baby eats! Unless you want it to die, is that it? Open your eyes. You're crazy. What's wrong? If there was no baby... would we still be together? You know I don't like those questions. Did I do something wrong? You can tell me. I'm scared you'll leave me. Why would I do that? We're having a baby, it'll be amazing. Come on. What was that? Is that what you feel? More and more. If a hand goes over it, it reacts. I even feel when it has the hiccups. It hears everything. Everything we say. Oh, shit. Sorry. Go on, talk to it. Um, hi. What should I say? I dunno, anything you want. Saying who you are is a good start. Hi. It's me, Nikolaï. Say it to the baby. It's me. It's Nikolaï. It's me. It's... It's me, your dad. Can I sing something to it? Yeah. You, little Drummer Boy Just another wartime hero Living in an old song That my mother used to sing Years ago I wonder where are you now? Do you tell the same story To the same enemy? I wonder where are you now? For my kids are sleepy What am I going to do with you? I'll be back soon. Camille! Nothing's changed. It's still a boy. Everything looks good. For the remainder of your pregnancy, I suggest going to the main hospital. - I'll forward your file. - OK. OK? Have you got enough paper towels? Nikolaï? I need your help. Where do you live? We thought you had crossed the border. To the left, the left! THE CHILD Are you still having contractions? Is there any pain? Loss of blood? She has a temperature. - How old are you? - Fifteen. Sixteen. I'm sixteen. It'll be a little cold. What is that? 180 is a little fast. Have you never heard that? - Is it its heartbeat? - Yes. Have you not had any tests done? Do your parents know? Yeah. Did they not want you to keep it? They're OK with it as long as we manage on our own. Could you give us a moment, please? The cervix is a little soft. Here. Is this not your first pregnancy? They didn't let me go full term. Is it a girl? Yes. You're eight months pregnant. Exactly 35 weeks. What's wrong? It's complicated. I'm scared. I don't want to lose it. It should be fine. You must have regular check-ups. That's not it. It's Nikolaï. He thinks he's the dad. Is he not the dad? No. He really wanted a baby and... I don't want another abortion. Have you told him? You must talk to him about it. The longer you leave it, the more complicated it'll get. I tried, but I can't do it. I'm happy with him. Is everything OK? I'm seven months pregnant. It's a girl. So, it's not a boy? No, look. Here's some antibiotics and a prescription for afterwards. It won't harm the baby. Know that the child is now viable. - If you want to give the baby a chance... - Of course we do. Then we have to come to mutual decision. Are you eating enough? - What are we going to do? - We'll talk about it later. Eat your chicken. What's wrong? Nothing. - Are you getting a hard-on? - No. Yes, you are. A bit, yeah. Get up. What are you doing? We're leaving. It's nice here. I have a bad feeling. They'll call the home, they won't let us keep the baby. Don't do that! It's for her. We had it good at their home. How do you feel? I feel some tugging in my belly. Here, your meds. Here. You have to eat. Go on. Not long to go now. You're so brave. Coming? Go to the lodge. I'll get supplies. Tell me what you need. Wait. The baby isn't yours. I was already pregnant. I wanted to keep it so I left with you. I didn't know how it would be with us. I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Is that true or not? You wanted this baby. No. Leave me alone. That was our child. Ours. Nikolaï! No! No! Camille! Come, let me take you to the hospital. I can't move! I'll carry you. Camille. It's too late. Camille, breathe. Everything's going to be fine. Come, lie down. Lie down. Lie down. Breathe. Niko, stay close. Camille, breathe. Breathe. Camille! Are you there? Calm down, please. Stay with me. Camille? Breathe. OK? Good. Please. Camille? Look. Camille, please, you can't leave us like this. Camille. Please. Where is she? Is she OK? I'm sorry. I didn't realise... Can we hold her? Of course, just wait a little for her to get acclimatised. Have you come up with a name yet? Julianne? Julianna. Julianna. Julianna. Thank you. This is our child, everything will be fine. DARK HEART OF THE FOREST
