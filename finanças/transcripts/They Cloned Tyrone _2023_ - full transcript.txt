But... - Listen. - Move, bitch. This is what I was thinking. How about we just wipe the slate clean, Fontaine? Know what I'm sayin'? And we both just grow, my nigga. Huh? Hey, hey. Listen, listen. Fontaine, why don't you take a ho on me? You look stressed. I don't really appreciate how you coming in here, you know, attacking my castle like that, you know, in front of my flowers. You know what I'm saying, Fontaine? Fontaine! Fontaine! Fontaine, goddamn it! I was a 1995 International Players Ball "Pimp of the Year." Show me some motherfucking respect! Childhood-ass nigga! Fontaine. Listen, we ain't liquid like we used to be, okay? Look, they dehydrated. These chickens ain't clucking like they used to. It's a cold front. That's all my contingency right there. Okay? Fontaine, why don't you just give me some more days, huh? You is a grinch! - We can settle up another way if you want. - You think I'm scared of you, nigga? Why does it always gotta be Black-on-Black crime? Hmm? Black men are supposed to support they niggas! Take your shit. Dramatic ass. You're lucky I'm a lover, not a fighter. Bitch-ass nigga. Hmm?

So, you know, I waited, and while this fool went to the bathroom, he left his phone. Wanted to see it, so, okay, I picked it up and went through it. Let me tell you something, Your Honor, it wasn't no Reggie from the job. Mama. You want something to eat? Not right now. I'm watching my stories. 2Clean Perm Cream. Because straighter is greater. Watch my cuticle now. Be gentle with it. Respect it. Respect that cuticle. Hmm. Shit. Y'all bitches have somebody come over? Mm-mm. - Who that?

Man, three, I'mma bust your shit open. Man, open the damn door! You know why I'm here? I think we got more pressing issues to talk about. - And what's that? - They shot your ass. Nigga, where the money at? Do you not remember getting lit the fuck up? You should be breathing through some tubes right now. - Look. I don't have time... - You took it. Fontaine, you took it. You came in here, you went through my haberdasheries. You passed up on my beige bitch, and you went outside and pulled a 50 Cent. - I told your ass if you wanna settle... - We can settle it another way. Ain't no way. Shit. You Ghost of Christmas Past-ass nigga. What the fuck kind of shit you playing on, huh? You done sold your soul to the devil. I know what you did. I know what you did. If there ain't no juice in this motherfucker, throw the damn bottle away! Fontaine. I seen them niggas shoot your ass six times. Mm-hmm. You think I'm lying, nigga? You ask Yo-Yo. She took off on me just before your ass got in here. Ask that trifling ass bitch which one of us is crazy. - Uh-uh. - Come on, baby. You ain't getting no motherfucking David Carradine for 50 bucks. Most I can do for you is a Susan Sarandon. - Let me get that. - Maybe a Shalamar. Nigga, you better get this good deal. My bad, Yo-Yo. Need to steal you for a minute. Don't you see we busy here? Don't you see we'll split your wig down the middle and you'll be a half a nigga? Get your beige ass the fuck out of here. You fake Obama-looking motherfucker. That ain't Michelle, nigga. Y'all owe me 50 dollars. I am retired. I just need some more dough before I can get to Memphis. There it is again, that slippery slope of recidivism. - I hate to see it. - When I'm there, I'mma find me a real man. Yeah, I'll find you a real man, 'cause I'm a real motherfucker. Not some McDonald's-dollar-menu has-been-ass nigga in a Goodwill suit. Keep talking goddamnit, and I'mma slip out of this Goodwill suit - and slap that fake-ass wig off... - What the fuck did you...? ...with nothing but my Gucci boxers on and be back in this coat before it wrinkles. You know I can do it. Oh, here you go with this ninja pimp shit. Hey! I just need to clear something up with you real quick. And you can be right back on your merry hoeing way. Uh... Okay. You seen me last night? Not like that. No. Like, literally. You seen me? Are you Kevin Bacon? Wait. What? Hollow Man. - That was a good one. You liked it. - Good movie. Good movie. Yeah. And I picked that one. You... mm-hmm. Okay. Yes, nigga. I saw you. You heard them shots after? I mean, I got ears, don't I? Somebody was letting them bitches loose. To be honest, I thought it was you doing me a favor. Yo-Yo. So, what you tryin' to say? You ain't seen nothin'? I mean, I didn't say all of that. You know your girl gotta know what's going on in these streets. So, yeah. I doubled back after a cool little minute. I think I saw the perpetrators leaving. I told you. Well, and? Yeah. I recognize the whip, 'cause I do house calls over on Second. Hold on. I ain't sanctioned that shit. Sometimes, I see the car parked a few driveways down. So, yeah. It looked mad familiar. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm done. You said I could go on my merry hoeing way. It's your boy, DJ Strangelove. I know it's been a long day. I know you need that tall glass of wine. I got that new Ruckus, "So Tired." Damn, I hate this motherfucking song. Fontaine, can you change this depressing-ass shit? Every time this song come on, I get... ...sleepy as hell. Mm. The house coming up on the left over here. Oh, that's the car right there. What the hell you looking at? That ain't the car. - That is the car. - Yo-Yo, that ain't the car. - I know what I saw. Don't tell me... - Wait a minute. I know that car. What you talking about? I saw it earlier the other day at the liquor store. So? Every rapper and ball player, they all drive that shit. Oh, goddamn it. You know what, Fontaine? You got this, uh, Rambo-esque look about you. So I'mma let you go and do your thing, and I'mma just sit right here in the car. Fresh air might be good for a nigga, though. Man, I ain't with this X-Files shit. Fontaine, this ain't no pimpin'. There ain't nothing pimp about this. Fuck!

A pimp, a ho, and a drug dealer walk into a bar. So you the nigga in charge? No. Everybody's got a boss. Mine's a real hard ass. You two would really hit it off. You see, I'm just the guy that guy calls when there's a mess that needs to be cleaned up. You should think of me more like mall security, except for a really, really big mall. Mall security? Y'all torturing people down there. We're not torturing anybody. We're researching, experimenting, doing science. And for the greater good, I might add. Oh, so you Kevin Bacon? Hollow Man, motherfucker. Telling lies in America. America was an experiment. A half-baked idea cooked up by aristocratic idealogues living in mansions built by slaves. And when they checked out, they left us with the bill. A country constantly at war with itself. No common ground, no dialogue, no peace. If we're all on the same page, then we're not ripping each other's heads off, and all of this has a chance to work. And that's what we strive for. Keeping the United States united. By cloning pimps and drug dealers? Everybody's got a part to play. In order for us to continue our work down here, this place has to have a certain flavor, quality of life, je ne sais quoi. What the fuck is you talking about, man? We in a trap. And you use us to keep it that way. If we were to pull y'all off the street, there'd be three Starbucks here by Tuesday, and there goes our control setting. So, yeah. We use you to keep the place, well, undisturbed. Lets us experiment on the good people here in peace. So the only reason I exist is to keep the place fucked up? Oh, Fontaine. Don't go glass half-empty on me, now. You're a goddamn patriot. As far as I'm concerned, you're Captain America. So, what now? Is that a trick question? No, ma'am. We've got a choice to make. And the way I see it, you've only got two options. Option one, Chester here kills you. Option two, you do nothing. You go back to your regular lives. Do what you do best. Look the other way. I gotta say option two sounds pretty fantastic. What do you think, Chester? Chester agrees. A real Sophie's Choice moment. Yeah, I've seen that one. So, what's it gonna be? - Option three, mother... - Olympia Black. - Olympia Black. - 'Taine? I say those words and you do what I tell you. I know it's unpleasant having no control. - Slick? Slick, Slick, Slick. - Feeling powerless. We all take autonomy for granted. But I really need you to understand your position here. We own you. That gold chain around your neck, that sweet, fine grill, that .45 in your hand. He ain't the only one with a gun, motherfucker. Unfreeze him, or I put a bullet through your fucking teeth. Fontaine. Fuck! Fontaine, point that gun at Yo-Yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 'Taine, no. No. You know what my friend Chester, Fontaine, and Slick Charles all have in common? They're expensive. You? A dime a dozen. Just a regular ol' ho. Don't let him do this shit to you. Doesn't seem like it's getting through. Fontaine, put that gun in your mouth! No, no, no, no. Fucking stop this shit! Fontaine, pull the hammer back! Shit. Don't you hurt him! Fontaine, say your prayers! Is it starting to sink in yet? Are you getting it? You got no cards to play! The only reason you are not dead is because I'm not the one calling the shots. Fontaine! Relax. - Good talk. - What the fuck? In the end, I knew you'd make the right decision. Chester, let's get out of here. Grab a cheeseburger. I'm starving. Oh fuck. Come on. Come on. You good? Fontaine? Sorry... You can't... What you doing? So I went by the church this morning. Key card ain't work. They must have flagged it. Don't know about them other places, I'm guessing there's... Yo-Yo. - We have to find another way in. - Yo-Yo! What? What's up? What's up? I'm done. Done? What? No. Yo, they can hear... I said... I'm done. All right? What the fuck is you talking about, "done"? We need to leave that shit alone. Yo, this shit is bigger than you. It's bigger than me. - It's your fucking home. - Who gives a fuck? This ain't no fucking community. This place a bunch of broke-ass niggas with nowhere else to go. Okay. Now, that's... that's a lot. - There are some good people. - Who? The jays? What, the gangbangers? Niggas that pay you to suck they dick? Ain't no good here. Hmm. It's 'cause of me. I'm a dope boy, 'member? It's who I am. So I'mma go right back to doing me. - That's your fucking excuse? - Excuse? I was made in a tube. I ain't even real. I ain't have no say in this shit. What about you? What's your excuse, huh? I seen the trophies in your room. What you trying to do? Be a doctor? - A detective? A fucking scientist? - Okay. Or was this your plan the whole entire time? What the fuck you want me to say? Yeah. I wanted to be in New York chasing down leads for the fucking Times or fucking in the Caribbean, scuba diving, looking for lost treasure and shit, but I'm here. Yep. Right up the street from the house I grew up in. Right up the street from all the same shit I have always wanted to get away from. Stuck in the same fucking trap as you. Nigga, I'm scared too. I am. But we gotta do something. I ain't scared. I'm cool with it. Maybe the next Fontaine won't be such a fucking pussy. Yeah. Maybe he won't.

If you looking for the bitches, ain't here. They had a, um, some kind of Pilates class or something they doing, you know. I let 'em... let 'em off for a few days. Anyway... Pimping ain't like it used to be, nohow. But you should've seen the furs. Should've seen the furs. I was a whole motherfucking polar bear. Down to the claws, nigga. And underneath, merlot leather. Them hos was dying of thirst. I never won the Players Ball, did I? But I can remember it like it was yesterday. I ain't never had no little brother. I still love him, though. Yeah. She contact you? Cussed me out. - She was right though. - She annoying as hell. Yeah. I'll tell you what. If we gonna buy into the insanity... ...let a pimp freshen up. Biddy! Biddy, let me holler at you a second. - Biddy. Come here! - Oh, fuck you, Slick Charles. - Fuck you! - Uh, nigga. No. I didn't mean that. Reflex. - Let me talk to you for a second. - Hell, no. Your ass went AWOL on me for about a week. What the fuck you talking about, AWOL? You bring your ass here. Baby, listen. I was dealing with some existential circumstances now. - What the fuck is that? - You know you my Lady Godiva. Don't make me shoot you out here. If you make me sweat in this coat, I swear I'll... Nigga, what you want? Listen. Look. We're just trying to find out where Yo-Yo is. That's all. - Nigga. - Biddy, Biddy, Biddy. Listen, listen. We work in a spirit of cooperation. Okay? Uh, we're on a quest. You give us the information we need, and we'll electric slide. Come on, Biddy. Please. I mean, the bitch been scarce. I figured she was waiting out the clap or some shit. But maybe I seen't her. Maybe I ain't. You know where my money at. She was here a few hours ago. Brown trench coat and some shades. Oh, she was looking like some freaky roleplay shit, and it was working for her too. Then she dipped off with one of them johns. Maybe a rapper or a ballplayer, I surmise. Wait. Why you say that? "They come and go through strategically placed egress points hidden in various neighborhood loci." Yo-Yo, this is really good. I mean, "loci"? Way to use your Latin. You got diagrams, reference articles... Shit. There's even a map. Pulitzer Prize-winning stuff. And I completely understand why you wanted to go to the Post. But you have got to tell me, do you really think that you figured it all out? You don't even know about the grand finale. Except you won't be around to see it. Fuck you. Been tinkering with one of our existing products. Just a little more potent now, but a little touch-and-go still. So, you might experience some side effects. So try not to lose your mind, okay? Fontaine, hold on. Fontaine, you can't do this. Fontaine! Come on, man. Mm-mm, mm-mm. - They got Yo-Yo, man. They got Yo-Yo. - I know. I know. I know. I know. But what you gonna do, huh? You gonna fee-fi-fo-fum it, and... and... and blow the whole goddamn house down? What we gonna do, man? What we gonna do? - We gonna do what Yo-Yo would do. - Nigga... Come on. Come on. We gonna put our motherfucking heads together. That's what we gonna do. - What you got in mind? - That's what we gonna do. We can't just go down there and ring the doorbell 'cause they got an army down there. Got an army, huh? What you thinking, nigga? You ain't gonna like it. So you're trying to tell me there's a bunch of Bill Nye the Science Guy looking motherfuckers underneath me right now? Experimenting on Black folk, cloning niggas that look like you so they can control our mind? Pretty much. And you need my help to stop 'em? Well, obviously the answer is no. But it's our home, man. Mamas, grandmamas, kids, they gotta live here too. And we make things bad for 'em. But right now, we're all they got. What kind of stupid-ass shit...? What the fuck is this nigga talking about, man? You fucked up coming here, my nigga. Damn, nigga. Fuck this nigga up. - So, no salt, no pepper, nothing? - Nope. Just the natural flavors of the chicken. Boiling it really brings it out. Huh. I just got a Crock-Pot. I'll try that when I get home. Right on, brother. Anyhoo, here we are. Decanting A-0-0-1. Don't worry, big guy. You'll feel like your old self in no time. Jo... Jo... Josephine had a fish fry... Still... I'm... I'm still... I'm... Mama, you hungry? Got that new-car smell, youngblood. There you go. Fontaine. - The fuck do you want? - What do you mean what I want? - What you want? - Nothing. Well, now, hold on, hot chocolate. We just negotiating. - Get out of here. - This is the art of the deal. You can have it your way, baby... Doze off! Doze off! Doze off! Doze off! There you go. Shit! He's gonna wake up, he gonna kill us. Ooh, ooh. He's waking up. I... I... I'm so sorry, Fontaine. Personally, I would never, but, you know, a girl needs a little coin in her purse. - And with the recent cold... - Listen, player. Just sit tight, okay? This is time for reflection and silent self-discovery. - Get the blinds. - Oh. What you thinking, nigga? You ain't gonna like it. You ever play dead? These bitch-ass niggas think they got it all figured out, but they forgot I'm a stone-cold pimp goddammit. I pull tricks for a living. We gonna beat 'em at they own game. But first things first, we need somebody to shoot your Black ass. Tell Isaac we need to talk, aight? Make it happen. And fuck you! - Hold the fuck up. - Shit, man. Fontaine come up on you, hit you in your shit, give you $1,000 saying he wanna talk to me? Man, that's what the nigga said, bruh. They got eyes everywhere, though. And you know they gonna be watching us. Let them. Ain't no easier mark than a sucka who sees exactly what he expects to see. Ten racks. Ten racks. - And all I got to do is shoot him again? - That's what he said. Thirty racks. Biddy said he said he wants thirty racks. Thirty? The nigga shot me for free the last time. He said fine. He said "fuck you" but fine. He told me to tell you one more thing. You better not miss. Now we got ourselves an Academy-Award-winning cast. Bunch of Bill Nye the Science Guy-lookin' motherfuckers underneath me right now? You could do better, bro. So you're trying to tell me there's a bunch of Bill Nye the Science Guy-lookin' motherfuckers underneath me right now? - That's it. That's it, Denzel. - That's it? Training Day or Book of Eli? - Book of Eli. - Fuck. Run it again. So it's time to put on a show. ...Bill Nye the Science Guy-lookin' motherfuckers underneath me right now? A show? Nigga, you want me to get shot. - It's only in the shoulder. - Man, get the fuck... Don't forget now. They gots to think you dead. All right. I got it, I got it. I'll be dead, okay? I'm dead. After that, hitch a ride underground, get comfortable, and wait till the coast is clear. Then use that stunning personality of yours to find a volunteer... I'mma need some directions. ...and get your new best friend to escort you to the control room. All right. Piece of cake, right. So while I'm doing all this, what the fuck you gonna be doing? Me?

This is my fault. I should've killed you the first time. Hell, I should've killed you the second time. Yeah, no. The east wing is compromised, but our department has taken minimal losses, sir. Yes, sir. Of course. After all these years... still so strange. Good to see you, Fontaine. - Flank around. - My wife says I'm getting soft. Come to you? Hell... No, nigga. Go the fuck around. A few too many mea culpas these days. Me, I try to find the brighter side of things. Learning from our mistakes, well, that's how we grow. Shit. Maybe when this is over, I'll have the boys come down and scrape up some of your cells, grow me a secretary. Well, you know what? I might have a few complaints to file with HR about the working conditions in this bitch. Speaking of Human Resources, where are your friends? Fucking up your shit as we speak. Well, one problem at a time. You're me. No. You're me. One of the many I've had to create over the years. So, what, you... you working for them? Let's just call it a marriage of convenience.

But yes, he is the reason I made a deal with the devil. A lot of paperwork, Yo-Yo. You know I hate paperwork. - Fuck paperwork! - Patience. - I hope you get buried in it! - Pimp hand raised. - Well, that's funny. - Ready. What the fuck? Shit. You know, we got operations everywhere. - Los Angeles, Chicago. - Fuck. But I picked the Glen because it was supposed to be quiet. Well, here you are causing a racket. You see, Fontaine, the... the powers that be, the invisible people above me who pull the strings, weren't getting the results they wanted. Years of experimentation. Billions of dollars spent, yet no true peace in America. Hair products, songs on the radio, fried chicken. Clones maintaining the charade. Short-sighted, waste of resources. All because they couldn't see what's so obvious to you and me. It's not enough to think the same, we have to be the same. Nah. You tripping, man. My work in the Cloning Initiative helped me track down 378 unique genes that separate you and your ghettos from your counterparts in the suburbs, the barrios... Chinatown. Once I sequenced them all, I approached my superiors with an addendum, and I'm sure you're aware of our first test subjects. In the lab, the tech, the manager. Not complete successes, but they pass. It's the hair. It's stubborn. But we have since perfected the process. I think niggas might notice if they wake up one morning with blond hair and blue eyes. This won't happen overnight, Fontaine. It'll happen over generations. And now we are at the precipice of our true national rollout. Assimilation is better than annihilation. Shit. Come on, Yo-Yo. How about we wrap this up? Shit. Krav Maga, Tuesdays and Thursdays. How're you feeling, Slick Charles? Hey, motherfucker! You think Ronnie would want this? Don't presume because I gave you a few memories you know my brother. You weren't really there that day when he died. Come on out, now. Don't be shy. Come on, now. You see, Fontaine, he was shot. Violently. Right here. Between interior ribs five and six. Missed the heart. Pierced the lungs. That didn't have to be fatal. They left him there alone, scared, laid out on the cold concrete. Took him 15 minutes to die. Why don't you toss that peashooter over to me? Now! Cute. You know, when I arrived at the morgue... I just stood over him for a long time. I... I knew it was him. I just... They couldn't be bothered to clean all the blood. And by that time, it had dried up... crusted black. So I... found a rag... and I cleaned it myself. I washed his skin. I spared you from that memory. I'mma go back to my fucking track. You don't gotta worry about me. We'll get out of your hair. I never could understand what you saw in him. I mean, I don't want to kick a man when he's down, but he's an idiot. Well, I guess you could say he's got a flair for the dramatic. He's Slick. I... I know you think you did something important here today, but what happened to Ronnie can never happen again. So my work will continue all the same. It must. We all have a part to play. I have mine. You had yours. Wish we could do this forever, but it's been a really long day. - You take care... - And he got style. Nigga got style. Slick, I know I talk a lot of motherfucking shit, but that's just a manifestation of my frustration. I mean, look at this motherfucker. I can't let you do this. Oh, I wish I didn't have to. Chester. Olympia Black. He look good, don't he? From the alligators to the furs, the leather to the gold chains. And the motherfucking rings. Olympia Black. Olympia Black. I am not a clone. No. He is. - Shoot him. - Wait... Ooh, you was taking your precious-ass time. Damn. That Goodwill suit ain't so bad now, is it? I was acting, motherfucker. Donna Kelley here reporting live from an absolutely outrageous scene. I'm here at the Check Cashing Place where dozens of confused, mostly naked people have emerged. 911 operators have been inundated with hundreds... What's amazing is how quickly residents of the Glen have rallied help. We've got folks out here giving out water, food, clothes off their own backs. In fact, I have some fellows who claim to have been the center of all the action. Sir, could you tell us what the heck is going on? - A whole lot of gang shit. - Shit. You know, boys had to click up, storm the castle. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? To be honest, I really didn't even used to f*** with him like that. - But now... - He with it now, though. ...when we see double, we know it's trouble. You dig? We some big-steppers with weapons. You know what I'm saying? Lil baby mama, I love you, girl. Yeah, that's right. We had to Deep Throat that s***. Watergate. Calm down, I got the receipts right here. They cloning motherfuckers as we speak in secret laboratories in Chicago, Illinois, uh, uh, Detroit, Michigan, Los Angeles, Califor... All day, every day, we're on the scene, trying to figure out what has happened. I mean, this shit is fucked up! They're out here cloning niggas. What the fuck going on in this bitch? That's right. That is the prevailing theory. A large contingent allegedly disrupted services this morning at the Greatest Mt. Zion Church of the Holy Ghost right here behind me. As you can see... - There he go. 'Taine! - 'Taine! - My nigga! - What up, baby? - Motherfucker. - Oh. Oh shit. Ooh, sorry, sorry. - This the real Fontaine? - Yeah, man. They're gonna have a hard time trying to cover this shit up. Mm. Oh, oh. And now's a good a time as any to tell y'all. I am retired. Yo-Yo, I think I'm gonna hang these gator boots up myself. I can't go back to the Royal because there's another Fontaine tied up, ready to whoop my motherfucking ass. You know what I was thinking, Fontaine? I might follow Yo-Yo's lead and head on down to Memphis, you know? Maybe they could use a couple of folk with our specialty skill set. 'Cause you know they ain't stop with the Glen. All the more reason. Mm-hmm. How about you? I don't know. Just a few days old. I'll probably see the world. Memphis don't sound bad. If y'all... - Aww. Y'all wanna come with me! - Come on, Fontaine. Y'all cool with it? Hello, Los Angeles. It is your partner Big Boy. - Big Boy! - Big Boy's neighborhood. Listen. I know that you feel a little shady right now, right? So go ahead, man, and shyste someone that you love. Shyste a neighbor. Shyste somebody that you work with. We gonna hit you guys off right now with that brand new Ruckus, "Shysty," right here in the neighborhood. Mama, you want something from the store? No. I'm good. I'm probably gonna hit the Voodoo market later. ♪ Hands up, play it down Where the mind at? ♪ ♪ Rob a nigga for the ransom money ♪ ♪ Rob a nigga for the ransom money ♪ ♪ She is scared, my baby She got scared of my money ♪ ♪ She a stripper, baby She got dancing money ♪ ♪ Shysty, shysty, shysty, shy Do what I say ♪ ♪ You are enslaved to do what I say ♪ ♪ Shysty, shysty, shysty, shy Do what I say ♪ ♪ You are enslaved to do what I say ♪ ♪ Shysty ♪ ♪ Shysty ♪ ♪ Well, get up ♪ Hey, man, let me get some of that.
