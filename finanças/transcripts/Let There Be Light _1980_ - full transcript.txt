[music playing] NARRATOR: The guns are quiet now. The papers of peace have been signs. And the oceans of the Earth arefilled with ships coming home. In faraway places, men dreamed of this moment. But for some men the moment isvery different from the dream. Here is human salvage. The final result of all that metal and fire can do to violate mortal flesh. Somewhere the bandages of their pain-- the crutches, the bandages, the splints. Others show no outward signs,yet they too, are wounded. This hospital is one of themany for the care and treatment of the psycho-neurotic soldier. These are the casualties of thespirit-- the troubled in mine. Men who are damaged emotionally. Born and bred in peace, educated to hate war. They were overnight plunged intosudden and terrible situations. Every man has his breaking point. And these, in the fulfillmentof their duties as soldiers, were forced beyond thelimit of human endurance. At ease, men. On behalf of the Commanding Officer and his staff at the Mason General Hospital, I want to extend a heartywelcome to all of you on your return to the United States. There's no need to be alarmedat the presence of these cameras as they're making a photographicrecord of your progress at this hospital from the date of admission to the date of discharge. NARRATOR: Here are men whotremble, men who cannot sleep. Men with pains that arenonetheless real because they are of mental origin. Men who cannot remember. Paralyzed man whose paralysisis dictated by the mind. However different the symptoms, these things they have in common. Unceasing fear and apprehension,a sense of impending disaster, a feeling of hopelessnessand utter isolation. INTAKE OFFICER: May I have your last name? NARRATOR: The psychiatrists listen to the stories of the men whotell them as best they can. The names and places are different. The circumstances are different. But through all thestories runs one thread-- death and the fear of death. And then after you got wounded, what happened? Same thing, only worse? Um. Seemed like the nervousness wasgetting worse all of a sudden. PSYCHIATRIST: Did they get worse? These nerve things-- they bombed. I got killing [inaudible]. NARRATOR: You nearly got killed. Where were you at the time? St. Laurent, I believe. PSYCHIATRIST: Keep going. Somewhere there. Somewhere-- I don't remember. PSYCHIATRIST: And what-- what were you doing when the planes came over? I was in a hole. PSYCHIATRIST: Do you know where you are now? I think I'm in the States now. They told me I was coming back. But they told me I was going to die. At the hospital I wouldn't eat hardly. I was sick, and I wouldn'teat hardly too much. I was going to die if I didn't eat. I couldn't help it. PSYCHIATRIST: Well. Told me that they didn'tcare whether I died or not. We will see that you won't die. You won't die. Well, I lost my last buddy up there. Little Norman. He was Second Scout. I was First Scout and it was all mixed up there. They were shelling us. Well, did that make you nervous? I-- I should of been. I'm First Scout and I shouldhave been out in front. And he went out and I started right after him. And he got shot. And he-- he-- just said, that gun hit me. Fell to my feet. And I started to call for the medic. And I went back to see ifwe could get the Medic, and there wasn't any. I started to go out after him again and they wouldn't let me go. And he was the last one of theoriginal boys who was with me. Him and I were the last twoleft, out of the original. And when you wereshelled, how did you feel? Well, I don't know. It's just after Norman got hurt-- got killed-- I was all right when wewere moving up or attacked or anything like that. But when we'd get pinneddown I'd just start thinking about hitting Liam back there. And how do you feelwhen you think about him? How would you feel? I just didn't care what happened to me. PSYCHIATRIST: Do you mean you didn't want to go back into combat again? Yes sir. I wanted to go back. I wanted to stay there. I wanted to keep on forhim and all the other guys. Norm, John, and Striker, and Tex, and Popper-- And how do you feel right now? I feel all right. PSYCHIATRIST: How are you getting along? Well, fairly well, sir. PSYCHIATRIST: Mm-hmm. You were overseas? Yes sir. PSYCHIATRIST: Where? Uh, we were in France andthen we went to Germany. PSYCHIATRIST: Where? France to Germany. PSYCHIATRIST: And what outfit were you in? I was in HeadquartersAttachment, 5th Headquarter Base of Battalion Mobile. PSYCHIATRIST: Mm-hmm. I see a VRC at present. Uh, you had to go to hospital. Sir? PSYCHIATRIST: You had to go to hospital. Twice, sir. It says here on your record from overseas that you had headaches andthat you had crying spells. SOLIDER: Yes, sir. Uh, I believe in your professionit is called nostalgia. PSYCHIATRIST: Otherwise, homesick? Yes sir. It was endorsed while shot before the war. I received a picture of my sweetheart-- PSYCHIATRIST: Yes? SOLIDER: I'm sorry. I can't go through it. That's all right. SOLIDER: Yes sir. Come on. Sit down a minute. Now this display of emotion is all right. I'm not doing this deliberately, sir. PSYCHIATRIST: Of course not. I believe you. I do believe you. Um, this display of emotionis sometimes very helpful. I hope so, sir. PSYCHIATRIST: Good. Gets it off your chest. You wouldn't-- you wouldn't be here. You wouldn't have been returned as a patient if there wasn't something upsetting you. Yes sir. PSYCHIATRIST: Now you say you had received a letter from your, um-- Not a letter, sir. A photograph. PSYCHIATRIST: A photograph, yes. What about that now? Well sir, to beperfectly honest with you, I'm very much in love with my sweetheart. She has been the one person thatgave me a sense of importance. It was that though her cooperation with me, we were able to surmount so many obstacles. PSYCHIATRIST: What happened? Well, when I was in combat in [inaudible]-- PSYCHIATRIST: Can you speak louder? I'm having trouble hearing you. Yes sir. During that time, I gotword that my brother-- he was killed in Mindanao. PSYCHIATRIST: What was he-- a marine? Yes. Now, I notice a necessarytestary here that you saw a vision of your brother. What, uh-- tell me something about that. What-- what happened? Well, I guess it was a dream. PSYCHIATRIST: Well, describe the dream. What-- what did you see in the dream? I-- I dreamt that I washome, my brother was home, my other brother was home. We were all home. PSYCHIATRIST: All of you were home. Sitting around the table. I always wanted to be happy. We were laughing, you know-- talking. Just admiring eachother-- and then it ended. You could see these images clearly? Yes. It was like in a dream, see? PSYCHIATRIST: Yeah. What about this Mindanao thing? Eh, you tell me about it. Well in Mindanao after I gotthat moonshine, I was, I admit, I was scared. PSYCHIATRIST: You were scared. I-- I don't know. I'd-- sometimes I'd hope something would happen. Then again I'd say, well,something did happen. PSYCHIATRIST: What do youmean by something happened. You mean you were hoping you'dbe wounded and sent back? Is that what you mean? No. PSYCHIATRIST: What do you mean by that? I meant that I-- I hoped that-- just I was always so disgustedand tired of everything. I just didn't feel like living. And then I'd change my mind. I'd think back on my folks. It would be a double blow. If something happened tome, I'll be standing guard. Sitting on a machine gun. Watching. And then I'd hear a little noise and I'd let go shoot with nothing[inaudible] than animals. PSYCHIATRIST: And you'dknow it would make a sound, and you'd just shoot? At that time, yes. Well, do you feel worriedabout anything now? Uh, I don't know. PSYCHIATRIST: Are you mixed up? Yeah. What's that pin on your shirt? My heart. PSYCHIATRIST: Well, why do you cover those up? Aren't you proud of them? Yes sir. PSYCHIATRIST: You got a purpleheart, your campaign ribbons? Yes sir. PSYCHIATRIST: Well why do you cover them up? There must be some reasonfor you doing that. No. Well, what happened over there? Well we got in a scrape and Iwas in the house there, checked out for guard until the end. It was Friday the 13thand swept it out all day. Patrol came up and [inaudible]. And they shot a [inaudible] thrust through a wall. Well-- PSYCHIATRIST: Then what? I-- I was laying on the couchthe night before it happened and I felt a little jittery. So I laid down on the floor. When I got up again, the couch was all torn. PSYCHIATRIST: You were all afield, was that it? Um. Most of them must have gone right over my head. Do you feel conscious? That is, are you aware of the fact that you are not the same boy that you were when you went over? Do you feel changed? Yes, sir. PSYCHIATRIST: In what way? Uh-- um. More choppy. PSYCHIATRIST: How about with people? I used to-- PSYCHIATRIST: Hmm? I used to always like to have fun. I used to always be going places. I don't do nothing no more. PSYCHIATRIST: How long were you overseas? [stuttering] Eleven months. PSYCHIATRIST: Eleven months. Were you in combat at all? [stuttering] Six months. I tried, uh, every wayto keep my mind occupied. Reading, going to the gymnasium, getting uh-- going out with the fellers andtrying to become and extrovert. Trying to get out of myself. But it seemed to me that I got worse and worse. And uh, after a while Ideveloped a fear of insanity. I developed fears of different sorts. PSYCHIATRIST: Did you ever havesimilar pains before you got deployed. Never in my life. PSYCHIATRIST: OK. Have you ever been nervous before? No sir. Never. I was a sullen man. PSYCHIATRIST: Do sudden noisesbother you particularly? --[stuttering] I just sh- shake a little. But not that b-bad. Well I guess I just got tired of living. You could put it that way. I had trouble sleeping, yes. Had-- dreaming of combat, you know. I just took off. Because I see too many of my buddies gone and I figured the next one was for me. A man can just stand so much of that, see? NARRATOR: Admission note. Transfer diagnosis. Anxiety reaction. Sever. Active symptoms in remission. On this, their firstnight back in the States, each man who is able maymake a long distance call without cost. After months and years of silence, familiar voices are heard once again. Then each man makes for himselfa small home which will be his for the 8 or 10 weeks to come. Now in the darkness of the ward, emerged the shapes born of darkness. The terror of things happened and remembered. Dreams of battle, the torments of uncertainty, and fear, and loneliness. [bugle horn] NARRATOR: The day begins with anearly morning ward inspection. The medical officer in charge checks the condition of every man. Modern psychiatry makes no sharp division between the mind and the body. Physical ills often have psychic causes. Just as emotional illsmay have a physical basis. Possibilities of organic disturbance in the brain are investigated by meansof the electron serigraph. The Rorschach test-- the thingsthat the patient's imagination sees in these cards gives significant clues to his personality makeup. SOLIDER: This looks sort of like a drawing of two women standing on arock and waving their hands. NARRATOR: This man is sufferingfrom a conversion hysteria and requires immediate treatment. Organically sound, his paralysis is as real as if it were called by a spinal lesion, but it is purely psychological. DOCTOR: Well just sit him upon the middle of the bed there. SOLIDER: Feel free to it. DOCTOR: That's fine. Now sit yourself over there. DOCTOR: Now, uh-- can youmove over just a little so I can talk to you? Yes sir. DOCTOR: Now what is the trouble? What's that? That's the nerves. It makes my flesh like that. DOCTOR: I see. How long has that been going on? Since Friday. DOCTOR: Friday? It's going numb. DOCTOR: Come on suddenly or gradually? Suddenly, sir. DOCTOR: How? Well it started in the afternoon in the car, I suppose. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. And I felt somethingfunny in my shoulders here. Back bothered me. I just started crying. I wasn't in control of my legs and my arms. DOCTOR: Was there anyreason for crying spells? I don't know, sir. DOCTOR: Hmm? Anything happen at home to bother you? Well, my mother's been ill. DOCTOR: She has been ill. That worry you a lot? Quite a bit. DOCTOR: Well now, has this got anything to do with your mother's illness? Any reason why you shouldhave that kind of reaction? No sir. Not that I know of. Unless my mother's illnessmight have brought this on. DOCTOR: I see. I try to hold in my hurts, but-- DOCTOR: I see. You've just been holding these things in? That's right, sir. DOCTOR: No way you can control this at all? No sir. Well now we're going to have to help you do. SOLIDER: Of course. DOCTOR: Let's take off this jacket here. Just slip that off. All right. Now lie down on the bed. Shoes? DOCTOR: No, we leave the shoeson so you can walk in them. We're going to get you walking. Let's come over here. That's a boy. That's fine. That's good. Now you lie steady. Lie steady, that's a boy. This is all going to go awayas I give you this medice. It'll be no bother at all. NARRATOR: The method employed here is effective in certain types of acute cases. An intravenous injection of sodium amytal induces a state similar to hypnosis. SOLIDER: What a torpedo that is. Do you mind if I look this way? DOCTOR: You look that way. Nothing for you to watch here. But you're going to talk to me as we go along. Yes sir. DOCTOR: That's all. Now you're not going tofeel much of anything else. You're going to feel a little bit woozy. NARRATOR: The use of thisdrug serves a twofold purpose. Like hypnosis, it is a shortcutto the unconscious mind. As a surgeon probes for a bullet, the psychiatrist explores asubmerged regions of the mind. Attempting to locate and bring to the surface the emotional conflict which is the cause of the patient's distress. The second purpose of this drug is to remove through suggestionthose symptoms which impede the patient's recovery. DOCTOR: Now tell me a little bitabout what you're thinking of. Nothing-- DOCTOR: No thoughts are coming to your mind now? Nothing in particular. DOCTOR: Well now let's go back. Let's go back to Friday. Friday? DOCTOR: Yeah. Think about that. Friday. My mother argues with me. DOCTOR: Your mother argues with you. Yeah. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. What does she argue about? Every little thing. If you Sit down in the wrongchair or something like that. Doesn't like the stuff you get at the store. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. And then she calms down. DOCTOR: I see. Have you always tried to please her? Yes. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Always tried to please her. I used to clean the house for her and-- DOCTOR: Well then why dothink she argues like that? Cause she's sick? Well, she doesn't try tocontrol her temper, you know? DOCTOR: I see. Mm-hmm. How about your father? He's a swell guy. DOCTOR: He's a swell feller. He's kind of hot tempered. Since my mother's been sick, it's been costing a lot of money. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. And he's lost a lot of weight worrying-- DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. I see. My mother argues with him. She wants to know where the money is. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. But I don't care aboutthat as long as everything turns out alright. DOCTOR: Well now I wonder-- this jumping? What does that make you think of? Think about it a minutes. I can't help it. It just jumps. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. How about the legs? Do you know anybody that hadany trouble with their legs like that? -No sir. Except-- DOCTOR: What does it make you think of? Come on. Several years ago-- DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. There was one feller that he had something wrong with his right leg. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Warm underneath, but he's walking today. That hasn't bothered me at all. DOCTOR: Was that anything like your leg? No, he couldn't walk at all. DOCTOR: He couldn't walk at all?-No. DOCTOR: What do you think ofwhen can't walk like that? I wish I could walk. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Well what do you think of? What comes to your mind whenyou find that you can't walk? Maybe I think my mother and father should be OK. Sometimes I wonder-- hope the war ends soon, things like that. Nothing in particular. DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Now the shakes are done now, haven't they? Yeah. DOCTOR: How about your legs? They're good and strong. Move them, let's raise them. Well I don't see them raising before. But I can't walk. DOCTOR: How about them now? They feel all right. DOCTOR: They feel good now,as if you can walk in them, don't they? -Toes feel numb. DOCTOR: Toes feel numb? But that's going away, isn't it? Yeah. See-- DOCTOR: Raising them fine, isn't it? Yeah. DOCTOR: Now you're going tobe able to walk, aren't you? I don't know. DOCTOR: Well you're going to, aren't you? Yes sir. DOCTOR: All right. I want to walk I love walking. DOCTOR: You love walking?-I did. DOCTOR: Always been very fond of walking. Now you've found yourself unable to walk. Well now you're going to get right up and walk. Right now. All right, now let's sit up. Sit up on the side of the bed. Here you are. That's fine. All Right, now stand up. And look at that. Now walk here. Walk over to the nurse, all by yourself. That's a boy. Walk over to the nurse. You're just a littlewoozy, that's the medicine. Now come back to me. Come back to me. Open your eyes. That's the boy. Now isn't that wonderful? PATIENT: Oh, sure.DOCTOR: All right, now again. Once more. PATIENT: Yeah, but I wantit always to be there. DOCTOR: Oh, it's going to stay that way. It's going to stay because that's taking care of your worries now. All right, now come on back to me and I'm going to let you go to sleep. And when you wake up, you'llkeep on walking perfectly well. How about it? PATIENT: Thanks, sir. DOCTOR: Right-o. All right now let's get you uphere and we'll let you sleep. Now there you are. Now I'm going to have you go right to sleep. When you wake up, it will be all right. Thanks. DOCTOR: All right sleep. NARRATOR: The fact that he could walk now does not mean that his neurosis has been cured. That will require time. But the way has been openedfor the therapy to follow. Now a new way of living begins. Very different from the oldone whose purpose was killing and trying not to be killed. Now in an environment of peace and safety-- all the violence behind them-- they are building rather than destroying. Men have their choice of occupational therapy. Some find relaxation in mechanical jobs-- certain types of cases ofpain relief and precision work-- which answers their innerneed for order and certainly. For sons, and daughters, and nieces, and nephews, and neighbor's kids, hobby horses are turned out by the carload. Physically reconditioning isnot the only purpose in sports, which also serve to bring men out of their emotional isolationand back in group activity. One of the most important procedures is group psychotherapy. Here under the psychiatrist guidance, the patient learns to understandsomething of the basic causes of his distress. As one of a group, healso learns to understand that his inner conflicts are, with variations, common to all men. PSYCHIATRIST: Now I think ofit a little bit like this. We want to get you out ofyour own feeling of isolation. To get you to feel thatyou are alike other people. In order to get to that, we have to use knowledge as one thing, and something else which has to be added. And that is an experience of safety. You could say is almost a coreof all our treatments methods. Development of knowledge of one's self with the accompanyingsafety it brings. I'd like to see if we canget some illustrations of how one's personal safetywould stem from child safety. And how would childhood safety self would stem from the parent's safety. Um, my illustration is thatwhen I was a child, whenever I was under any experiencesthat were frightening to me, I never told my parents. I kept it to myself. While I was alone at nightin my room, I'd call on god. That if I'd done anythingwrong that I was ashamed of. I was ashamed that to go to my parents and tell them what I had done. So I kept it to myself. And I used to-- I know Iused to be in constant fear that my parents would find out my feelings. Well I wonder if there'sany of your mother's troubles that you would know about? No, um, uh-- my mother never gave any of the children any part of the troubles. Well, that would be the samething that happen to you. She didn't tell her troubles,and you didn't tell yours. You took your troubles to god. And she probably did the samething-- probably didn't even confide in your father. In other words, the kind ofmethod that you used to get relief from anxiety was really--we'd have to assume-- learned and felt right in your homethe same kind of thing. I think it was all causedby economic conditions of the world. I mean, people trying tocompete with one another. Trying to get better jobs, trying to keep up with the uprising,and living things like that. Of course, a lot of arguments in the home, mother and father arguingabout prices of the food and PSYCHIATRIST: That's right. I think that was one ofthe causes of my illness. PSYCHIATRIST: Not having enoughfood to eat or the arguments between the mother and father? Well, both. PSYCHIATRIST: Which was the worst of them? Well, I just-- they'd argue. PSYCHIATRIST: Sure, of course they argued. Because I can't remember about the food. PSYCHIATRIST: There you are. You can't even remember aboutthe food or the lack of food. I have in mind own childhood. We're uh-- coming from a moderate family. Moderate in the sense that the family had some sense of security. What happened there was thatwe were told that we-- I mean myself, my brothers, and sisters-- we couldn't just play with any of the kids we wanted to play with. Unless their parents in turnhad the equivalent of what our parents had. And as a result, we were kept in a narrow circle. Very, very narrow. However, I have found that there has been a strong yearning on my part to break out of this environment. To be able to play withTom, and Dick, and Harry. I say, the net result is like this is. Your mother did not feel really so superior. She felt inferior and when she tried to make or take the attitude that you were better than the other children. So that now, and certain experiences in the army, have brought that out more clearly. Because you've been thrown in with Tom, and Dick, and Harry andneed to get along with them. It's necessary to be in the army. Is not necessary to be in the war. These kinds of troubles havealways gone on in all time, to all the centuries. Did you want to say something? I never spoke until I was 7. PSYCHIATRIST: Is that right? Yes sir. And I stuttered very bad. At 14 and 15 I couldn't recite in school. They made me talk. PSYCHIATRIST: Can you explainhow you got started to talk? How you began to get over that? Uh, during-- during the war,the first word I ever spoke, um-- Santa Clause had brought me a war gun, and my brother broke it. PSYCHIATRIST: This isthe first World War, yes? [laughter] So um-- PSYCHIATRIST: And your brother broke it. Yeah, when I went and getmy gun, I was, I just says, well, dick. Somebody's broke my gun. That's the first thing I said. You were angry because someone broke your gun. Well, that's the way I started to talk. PSYCHIATRIST: I would say, allthose symptoms-- like being unable to speak,stuttering, and so on-- they have underlying anger and resentment in the deeper parts of the personality. You can almost say it like this. Underneath "I can't" you usually find "I won't." Kevin, on Okinawa I was stuttering, too-- about three weeks. And as soon as I came here-- near a month now-- I've stopped stuttering. PSYCHIATRIST: You've stopped stuttering completely since you got here?-Yes sir. PSYCHIATRIST: That's good. I know that's a tributeto you doctors, a tribute to your fundamental health. I think it's to my fundamental self. PSYCHIATRIST: No-- no tributeto the doctor's at all? No sir. [laughter] PSYCHIATRIST: Very good. NARRATOR: Some patients require special therapy. Hypnosis is often effectivein certain types of battle neuroses such as amnesia. This man does not even remember his own name. A shell burst in Okimawa wiped out his memory. The experience was an unendurable to his conscious mind which rejected it. And along with it, his entire past. Through hypnoticsuggestion, the psychiatrist will attempt evoke them. PSYCHIATRIST: Relax completely. And uh, put your mind on going to sleep. All right, now keep your eyes on mine. Keep your eyes on mine, andkeep them fixed on mine. And keep your mindentirely on falling asleep. You're going to go intoa deep sleep as we go in. You're going to go intoa deep sleep as we go in. Now clasp your hands in front of you. Clasp them tight, tight, tight, tight, tight. They're getting tighter and tighter and tighter. And as they get tighter you're falling asleep. As they get tighter, you're falling asleep. Your eyes are getting heavy.Heavy. Now your hands are locked tight. You're locked tight. They're locked tight. You can't let go. You're locked tight. You can't let go. When I snap my fingers,you'll be able to let go. When I snap my fingers,you'll be able to let go. And then you'll get sleepier. And your eyes are getting heavier. [snap] Now your eyes are gettingheavier, heavier, heavier. You're going into a deep, deep sleep. You're going to a deep, deep sleep. Deep asleep. Far asleep. Eyes are now closed tight. Closed tight. Going to a deep, deep sleep. Deeply relaxed. Far asleep. You're far asleep. You're far asleep. Now you're in a deep sleep. You have no fear, no anxiety. No fear, no anxiety. Now you're in a deep, deep sleep. Now just sit down in the chair behind you. Sit down in the chair behind you. Lean back. And now fall forward into a deep, deep sleep. Your head is now falling forward. You're going further, andfurther, and further asleep. I stroke your left arm to come rigid. Like a bar of steel. And you go further asleep. Further asleep. Falling further, further, further asleep. Rigid. Cannot be bent or relaxed. When I touch the top of your head when I touch the top of yourhead, that arm will relax and the other will become rigid. And you'll go further asleep. You'll be in a very deep sleep. And your sleep is deeper and deeper. And Now when I touch thishand, my finger will be hot. When I touch this hand, my finger be hot. You'll not be able to bear it. Your arm is rigid. And now as I touch your hand, you will no longer feel any pain there. It will be normal. Now the arm is relaxed andyou're further, and further, and further asleep. Now you're deep asleep. We're going back. We're going back now going back to Okinawa. Going back to Okinawa. You can talk. You can talk. You can remember. Everything. You can remember everything. Going back on Okinawa. Tell me what you see. Tell me. Speak. I'm in the battery area. PSYCHIATRIST: You're in the battery area. Go on. Tell me what's going on. Getting fire missions. PSYCHIATRIST: You're getting fire missions. Go on. You can see everything now clearly. We're getting shells thrown as us. You're getting shells thrown at you. From where? -Japs. Japs. Go on. [mumbling] Yes. [mumbling] Keep on. You remember it all now. Every bit of it is coming back. The Japs getting nearer to get our position. PSYCHIATRIST: Japs gettingnearer to get your position. Go on. They told us to get coming-- Who told you to get coming? AC. AC. Go on. He's fighting us. One of the boys got hurt. One of the boys got hurt. Kicking away [inaudible] current position. Yes go on. You remember it now. Tell me. It's all right now, but you can tell me. You can tell me. Explosion. PSYCHIATRIST: Yes. You remember the explosion now. All right, go on. They're carrying me. PSYCHIATRIST: They're carrying you. Who was carrying you? Davenport. PSYCHIATRIST: Where are they taking you? Carrying me across the field. Across the field. Go on. Put me on a stretcher. Yes. Yes? Go on. They're still-- they're still throwing shots. PSYCHIATRIST: Yes. Can you hear them? Yes. Can you see them? No. All right. Where are they taking you now? And it shook. Why are you fearful now? I don't want to-- PSYCHIATRIST: You don't want anymore? No. PSYCHIATRIST: You want to forget it. But you're going to rememberit because it's gone now. It's gone. You're back here now. You're away from Okinawa,you've forgotten it. But you remember who you are now. Who are you? That's right. Full name now. That's right. Hmm? Know your mother's name? Isabelle. PSYCHIATRIST: That's right. Fathers? Jonathan. PSYCHIATRIST: That's fine. Know who they all are now? All right. Now you're coming back with us. This is going to stay with you. You're going to remember it all. You're going to remember about Okinawa. You're going to remember aboutthe shells and the bombs. But they're gone. At ease, relaxed. There's no fear, no anxiety. When I wake you up, you'llbe comfortable and relaxed. No pains and no aches. But you'll remember all that I've told you. All that you have remembered. You can wake now. Well. How are you? Pretty good. NARRATOR: Under the guidanceof the psychiatrist, he is able to regard his experience in it's true perspective as a thing of the past, which no longer threatens his safety. Now he can remember. PSYCHIATRIST: Well, what's your trouble? Hmm? --[stuttering] It's hard hard forme to get my words words out. PSYCHIATRIST: Yeah, it does seem to be a bit tough. How long have you had that trouble? --[stuttering] It started a while ago. Month ago. PSYCHIATRIST: Where were you then? In uh, France. PSYCHIATRIST: Have you been in combat? Yes. PSYCHIATRIST: Well maybe wecan help you talk a bit better and you can tell me more about it then, right? Let's lie down and see ifwe can help you on that. NARRATOR: This man is not a chronic stutterer. He suffers from a battle tension, which the drug will attempt to diminish. Like the man who could not walk, and the man who could not remember, hisillness has an emotional basis. PSYCHIATRIST: You're all comfortable and relaxed. We're just going to give you some medicine here and it's going to help limberout that tune of yours. And this is going to makeyou feel a bit groggy. Now, tell me now. How do you feel now? Hmm? Make any difference in your feeling. It feels just like seventh heaven. PSYCHIATRIST: What is it? Tell me about it. Yeah. I can talk. PSYCHIATRIST: That's fine. I can talk! I can talk! PSYCHIATRIST: That's good, boy. Listen, I can talk! Oh god, listen! I can talk! Holy mother of god, listen! PSYCHIATRIST: All right, it's coming back now. You can take it easy. Just take it easy. Oh listen, I can talk! PSYCHIATRIST: Just the way you always did. All right? Hmm? God listen. God, I can talk! PSYCHIATRIST: Just the way you always did. Why are you crying with it now? Oh, it's nice. PSYCHIATRIST: Just take it easy now. Just talk a little lightly now. Tell me, go any idea whyyou couldn't talk before? What's coming to your mind now? Hmm? Tell me, what's coming to your mind now? What is it in your mind when you couldn't talk? What is it that stopped it? Something came through there and stopped it. What is it now? Think quickly. Think deeply. Let's go back. When was it you lost your speech? Had you trouble talking? Go back quickly. Seems that first noticed it on a boat. PSYCHIATRIST: On a boat. It turned over. I first started with an S.And the fellers laughed at me. I dind't know why they laughed. That's when it started. PSYCHIATRIST: Well let's talk with that S. Let's go back to that S now. What were you thinking then? What was in your mind then? Right now? PSYCHIATRIST: No. Then. -On the boat? PSYCHIATRIST: Yes. With that S. When youcouldn't say that S right. S? PSYCHIATRIST: Yes. Portside. PSYCHIATRIST: Portside. Portside. PSYCHIATRIST: Mm-hmm. Portside of the ship. PSYCHIATRIST: What side is that? That would be the left side. PSYCHIATRIST: Left side. That's right. Yeah, I remember. Because we were up there that afternoon and we saw the fishes. Yeah, we had some flying fishes. And I came down, and he said,I was telling the feller underneath me about the portsthat I had seen some flying fishes on the portside. NARRATOR: He tried tellinghim about the flying fishes and he stumbled over the S sound. And the fellers laughed at him. Think hard. S. S. What does S remind him of? S. S. He remembers. It was the sound he fears. The sound of death in combat. [hissing sound] The sound of aGerman 88 high explosive shell coming in. Now it is possible toproceed to the basic method of psychiatric treatment. Discussion and understanding of the underlying causes of his symptom. [music playing] NARRATOR: As the weeks pass, the therapy begins to show its effect. The shock and stress of warare starting to wear off. All these men are blessed withthe natural regenerative powers of youth. Now they are living less in thepast and more in the present. Sometimes they think of the future. The war years must be putaside and the responsibilities of peace must be considered. A man might open a fillingstation or a hardware store. Or he can buy a few acres ofland and raise some chickens. He might even go back to school. Visitors day. Now the men resume theircontact with the world outside. These are the people theyare coming back to, whose lives are bound up in theirs. Without their understanding, all that has been accomplished in the last few weeks can be torn down. With it, their return to lifecan be doubly swift and sure. Classes in group psychotherapy continue. The men are thinking of themselves in relation to society. How will they fit into the post-war pattern? How will the world receive them? PSYCHIATRIST: You've fellershave had an opportunity to be home with your families since you returned from overseas. Have you noticed any changein the various members of your family toward you andtheir reactions toward you? Well I found out thatafter four years of absence, that it only took me the secondday to be really relaxed. And I was right chumming again with my dad, and we talked about the old neighborhood, and the new changes. I don't know. It surprised me. PSYCHIATRIST: Do you feel that your family has to be taught how totreat you when you come back? No, absolutely not. PSYCHIATRIST: How do youwant to be treated by family? The same way I was treatedbefore I went into the service. No different. PSYCHIATRIST: You don't wantto treated any differently? No. I was talking to one man and I say, what do you think of us fellers that come back with psychoneurosis anxiety state? And I says, you can see that we're not, uh, crazy by any means. He say, well Ma, before I comeout here to see you-- he says, my first impression was like in Bellevue. He said, fellers from the lastwar were completely maniacs. He said, that was my first impression. Then I wondered if uh-- Imean, the great percentage of the people got to belike them when we get out. PSYCHIATRIST: That is a common concern among servicemen who have developed nervous conditions during their stay in the army. As to what the public isgoing to think about them. Undoubtedly, there will be people on the outside who won't have any understanding of the condition. Who may think of it as beinga rather shameful condition. That's why we're having aneducational program trying to educate the public into understanding. Unfortunately, most of you fellas have gone through some verysevere stresses in the army. Stresses that civiliansare rarely subjective to. In civilian life, you can avoid serious stresses. If a civilian-- the average civilian-- were subjected to similar stresses, he undoubtedly would have developed the same type of nervous condition that most of you fellas developed. All of us have so-called breaking point. A survey outside showedthat civilians on a whole were more nervous than soldiers. On Park Ave, for instance, forsome of your richest people there, most of the patients are people who suffer from nervous disorders. And if the doctor won't give them a pill, why they'll go out and say, well he's not a good doctor. So therefore, they're giving pills and they're taking them at home. They take these pills athome because the hospitals are too full. If the hospitals were empty,they'd be in the Sanitarium and so forth. Having experience withnone of these discussions like the other men have, I know that we have a learning the basisof how we got nervous. Some of us through combat, and some of us by not being in combat. And I think-- I'm sure thatwe have a better understanding of our conditions. And I'm pretty grateful of beinghere at Mason General Hospital, like a lot fellas are. It just so happens that I couldn't walk. And they made me walk. I couldn't walk when I arrived,and I was here 24 hours and they made me walk. I feel pretty grateful getting my limbs back. PSYCHIATRIST: Wow. But [inaudible], it start-- Iknow that uh, when I got here and the other fellas did,too-- we tried out best to make ourselves as best we can. And uh, we feel more confident then to grasp this nervous situationsthat have come about us. And we want to show youpeople that we can do things on our own on the outside. Whether we've been inthe hospital for nervous, or anything, if we lost and arm or a leg, that we can be just as good as anybody else. Well all I want is that they give us a chance to prove our equality, like they said they were. I hope they keep their promise. That's all I hope. Would you make it a point totell your employer that you were a psycho-neurotic? Well, if he's an intelligentman-- which most well known employers are that own large concerns-- why, he's going to react thesame as any other normal human being would. He's going say, it's absolutely plausible. And a man, right now if it'sall right, I'll try him out. But you may run into employers who are not that broad-mindedor intelligent. Yes sir. And I'll sell myself to them. PSYCHIATRIST: How about you? Do you have any plans about jobs? Or do you have any fears about getting a job or-- That's fine. I have my job waiting for me, sir. PSYCHIATRIST: You haveyour job waiting for you. I think it comes down to this, doesn't it? That most of you fellowsfeel that you ought to be honest with your employer. That you have nothing to hide,nothing to be ashamed of. Yes sir. PSYCHIATRIST: Isn't that the general attitude? Your time in the service was not entirely wasted. You have learned a great deal of the service. For instance, a great many jobsand tasks that you have learned to do in a service that you have had absolutely no contact with the past. You've learned to work in groups-- something that every soldier learns to do very early in his military career. This definitely will be of much value to you in your future civilian employment. [music playing] NARRATOR: The weeks have slipped by fast. The first strings of hospitallife has become routine. Sometimes a man learns something new. A ranger always did want to play guitar. [guitar music] NARRATOR: And now the days begin to seem long. There's the old helpless soundof bellyaching in the air. Spinach? Spinach, again? And how about a good movie for a change? And how about putting some icecream in the ice cream soda? No longer is a man shut upwithin the lonely recesses of himself. He is breaking out his prison into life. The life that lies aheadoffering infinity possibilities for happiness and salve. How does a man find happiness? Is it a secret to discover? What is the mysterious ingredient that gives joy and meaning to living? PSYCHIATRIST: You know in the bible where it says, "man doesnot live by bread alone?" Children don't go up wellwithout safety and confidence. If that wasn't in one's childhood in growing up, you could say, now there's something missing during all that time. And the next question is, how to supply it. And it does need to be supplied. Not all of the learning and all of the books is half as valuable in getting over nervousness as to find someone that you esteem that you can learn to feel safe with. Where you can get a feeling ofbeing accepted, of cherished. Where you get a feeling that you are worthwhile, and that you are important to someone. You could say, the feeding that you didn't get that'ssomething more than bread, when you were little. You still need to get it. You still need to be fed acceptance and to find the safety. In other words, knowledgealone is not enough. [cheering] NARRATOR: 8 weeks have passed. What about these men? Are they ready for discharge? How complete is their recovery? [cheering] NARRATOR: How about the boy in right field? I just didn't care what happened to me. NARRATOR: How the kid at bat? In fact, I was covered by dirt. I was covered up for 29 hoursafterwards until they found me. Out! You're out! NARRATOR: How about the umpire? --[stuttering] I-- I-- I needto get my w-w-words out. You're out! Go on! Batter up! NARRATOR: How about this kid? How about him? Are they well enough to be discharged? That is for the doctors todecide at tomorrow's morning. The answer is yes. [MUSIC PLAYING "WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME AGAIN"] OFFICER: Men, this is yourlast military formation. Today you're returning to your homes, your families, and friends. Many of you have been lookingforward eagerly to this day. But remember, when you reenter civilian life, on your shoulders fallsmuch of the responsibility for the postwar world. May your lives as civiliansbe as worthy as your records as soldiers. Good health, good fortune, and God speed. [music playing]
