I'm going to put this on the sideboard. I want her near me. Zola, do you know anything about Ayanda's stuff? Ma, this is not a good time. It's all gone... everything, the boxes, the paintings, everything. I was trying to clear up her room and I don't know what to think. I feel like I'm losing her all over again. Who would do this to me, Zola? Who would do this to me, my Lord? They're with me, Ma. What? I came and took them last week. You should have told me! I'm telling you now. You know I haven't slept for nights worrying about those things. Zola? Zola, are... Are you still there? Ma... why are you clearing out our room? I have someone coming to stay. You remember your aunt, Nomaliso? She's just going to stay for a few days. Okay, Ma, I don't really have time for this now... I'll call you back, okay... bye. Wow. What? Oh, this? Oh, this is just something I throw together when I'm planning a little... Okay, let me just leave it there. No, please go on. For me? Oh, and uh... Come inside. Gosh, you know, I almost burned the steak medallions. I didn't even ask you if you eat meat. Oh, God, no. Serious? No, I'm a vegan, ja. Ever since I spent a year in an ashram in the Himalayas. Oh, gosh, um... Well, I did make, like, a little salad. No, I'm kidding, Zola. I can't think of anything better than steak medallions. The bloodier the better. And I've never stayed in an ashram, and I don't think I've ever been east of Durban. Well, Zanzibar, maybe. Won't you do me a favour and put some water in this for me? Sure. Did you know, that if you want the sweetest smelling roses, you should plant garlic nearby? Oh, no I didn't know that. The Byzantines discovered this. The thornless white rose was their symbol of the purity of the Virgin. Won't you... do the honours for us? So you found the place all right? Yeah, sure, no problem. You know the area? Ja, I used to live down the road in Yeoville, but, I mean, that was ages ago. I haven't been this way in years. So you paint, huh? Oh, no, that's not me. That's a friend of mine. She's not here. Oh, right. Is something the matter, Ryan? No, no, it's just um... You keep looking around. No, it's nothing. Maybe you've been here before. No, couldn't be. Or maybe somewhere similar. I mean, all the flats in the street look the same. Maybe. Can I use your bathroom quickly? Sure. Yeah, that way. Well... this is me... Zola. And... this is how this thing begins. Oh, shit... Sorry, it's just a... technical... Okay, there. Better. Ja, um... As you can see, he's here. He's in the flat. He arrived on time. He seems a bit nervous, but... I'm gonna get him to - Okay. Invite your friends. Keep watching. Shit's about to get real. Hey, won't you help me with these? Sure. I hope you like a mushroom sauce? Are you kidding me? It's like you know everything about me already. Maybe I do. Should I be afraid? Maybe. You said, the other night, about the mushrooms. Did I? Yeah, you'd had a couple of drinks, by then but... Aah, we're going to need a sharper knife. Ryan, wait... uh... Ryan. I have uh... one here... Zola, where's all your shit? Ryan, no, wait... Ryan... What is this? Is this a camera? Yeah, it's a project. I'm a filmmaker, remember, I told you. But you said you were a social worker. Yeah, that's true. And on the side, I make films. What the fuck, Zola? Are you filming this right now? Yeah. But why? Fuck. What? I was hoping we could have, like, a nice relaxed chat and dinner before... Before what? Before this. Fuck! What the...? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, um... Well, this is happening a lot faster than I'd planned, but... yeah, it's okay... This is good. Here we go. What the fuck, man? Let me go! Shut the fuck up, Ryan, no one's going anywhere. Would you... Could you... Can you please just tell me what the hell is going on? Tell you what, Ryan Hunt, why don't you tell me? Come clean. This is your last chance to just get it all out. Get what out? Look me in the eye, now and tell me everything that happened. What? How? Why? And then I'll let you go. That'll be the end of it. I don't know what you're talking about. That is bullshit. You knew the second you walked in here. You recognized this room. Please, Zola... Whatever it is you think I've done... you're wrong. Okay? Guy... this is your last chance, okay? I'm not going to beg you. How can I come clean if I don't even know what it is that I'm supposed to have done? Ayanda Kunene. What? Ayanda Kunene. Who's Ayanda Kunene? Okay, so we're gonna to do this the hard way. Okay, cool. Fine. That's even better. Please. Just tell me! Ayanda Kunene is my sis- Was my sister. She took her own life, nine years ago, three days after you raped her. You've made a mistake. We'll see. I promise you. Okay, no, don't say anything yet, okay? We gottto do this right. Do what right? I'm putting you on trial. There. You're going to stand trial, Ryan. I'm going to get the justice for Ayanda that she couldn't get for herself. This is insane. This has got to be a joke. No jokes, Ryan. We're going out on a dozen platforms, and while you're out we sent DMs to hundreds of people that we think might be interested in seeing justice done. Who's 'we'? Me. I'm doing this. That's all you need to know. I'm the prosecutor. And who's the judge? Who's the fucking jury? Them. They are. A jury of your fucking peers. And who's going to defend me? I'm afraid you're going to have to do that yourself. Oh, this is fucked. This is completely fucked up, man! Ryan, relax! Fuck! Everyone is watching. Everything that you do now is going to have an impact on how they judge you. Okay? So now we begin. Ryan Hunt... You are hereby accused of raping Ayanda Kunene. It is alleged that on the night of the 24th of December 2012, you were invited for drinks at 108 Glynmar Court, prior to going out clubbing in town. But that never happened because on that night you tied my sister down and you raped her. That's the charge. How do you plead? You are completely insane. Plead. I don't even know who you're talking about. How do you plead?! I will not plead! Just... Just untie me. So you plead not guilty? Is that what you're saying? Go to hell. Incoming chat request. Incoming chat request from: Kwela Kid. Okay... let's test this out. Kwela Kid, you're on. Hello? Kwela Kid, you're live, what do you want to say? This is a joke, nê? Is this for real? No jokes. I'm deadly serious, I'm sorry to say. Nine years ago my sister killed herself. The autopsy revealed that she'd been raped and... I spent years tracking down the perpetrator. Him. So tonight we get justice for Ayanda. Oh, fuck... hang on... Hello? Are you still there? Can you hear me? I can hear you. Hey listen man, you've got to help me, this whole thing is completely insane. I don't know this girl, we just met a few nights ago. She invited me around for... Please, man, you gotto call the cops, she's completely fucking nuts. Where you, bro? I'm in a flat in - Hello? I can see you, but... I don't have any sound. - But I'm here, can you hear me? - I didn't get the address. I'm still here. Hello? Hello, are you... Hello? It's not going to happen, Ryan, not like that. You see... the sooner you understand that everything is going to happen the way that I say it is going to happen the better. Now, I'm not going to punish you because you didn't know. But if you shout anything like that again. If you try anything like that again. Okay! Okay! I get it! I get it! Nothing goes out unless I say it goes out. Do you understand? Now I'm going to try my best to be as fair as I can, but it's going to happen. There is no way you can wriggle yourself out of it. Do I make myself clear? Sorry about that glitch. There are the hashtags, follow us on Twitter for more. Okay, so... Where were we? You still need to plead. Fuck you. No, Ryan. Fuck you! I said enter a fucking plea! Okay! I'm not fucking guilty! I'm not guilty. You satisfied?! A plea of not guilty has been entered. Now it's up to you to decide. Ask your questions. Say your statements. You're the judge. You're the jury. Okay... Entering into evidence. This is my sister's diary from 2012. My sister kept a diary for as long as I can remember. So let's turn to December 24... In the morning... a list of things to do. And at six... “Drinks with RH”. This was her last ever entry. Three days later she was dead. I put it to you, Ryan Hunt, that this RH is you. That's your evidence? Exhibit One. There's got to be a million people on the planet whose initials are RH. So you deny that this is you? Yes, I deny it, I've already told you I didn't know your sister. - But you did. - Says who? Jesus, man, this is beyond fucked up. Okay, let me jog his memory. History of Art. Ayanda studied at WITS. Where you did your Master's. Where you tutored her. I had a lot of students. Oh, fuck. Here... Here! Look at her! This picture was taken one year before she died. Look at her! Okay, just calm down, okay, just hold it still. That's you and her, huh? And she was... what... my... Art History tut, 2012? Jesus Christ. Okay. - Oh, okay. - Maybe. So now you remember her? Dimly. I mean, it was a long time ago. Dimly. I mean, it was a long time ago. God, listen to yourself! What?! Ryan, you are lying. You recognized this place. I saw it the second you walked in. I swear to you, I've never been here before in my life. But it feels like you have been. No, you're wrong. Ayanda had a flat just like this, across the road. And on Christmas Eve, nine years ago, you were there. At her flat. Flat 108. - It looked exactly like this. - Hang on, hang on... No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait a second. Wait a second. Christmas Eve, 2012? Ja. No. No, it's not possible. Why not? Because that's when I went to the UK. Exactly! You raped her and then you ran. No, I flew out on Christmas Eve. Bullshit. I swear to you, it's the truth, honest to God. I remember because it was the cheapest flight I could get. Do you have proof of that? How can I prove that? Your passport. Do you still have it? Yeah, maybe somewhere, but I mean, you know, it would have expired by now. It's still evidence, Ryan. If there's a stamp in there that says that on the 24th you were in the UK, then you're cleared, and then I was wrong. Okay, well... let me check it out. Where do we find it? I dunno... my place somewhere... But I mean, I've just got back from overseas - Is there someone who can help us find it? Yeah, I think so. Terry. Terry Bartlett? Jesus Christ. What don't you know about me? I've been your Facebook friend for years, Ryan. So maybe next time, think twice before you accept a friend request from some blonde lady with big boobs with no mutual friends. Go on, tell them who Terry is. Terry's just a guy I know. We go back a bit. Yeah. You went to St Luke's together, and he is the only person that you have kept in close contact with. Yeah? So let's call him. You serious? Why the hesitation, Ryan? I mean, if you're innocent, then the person who's responsible for this is still out there. Mistakes happen, so let's get to the bottom of this. Okay. So... Where's your phone? This pocket. Incoming Chat Request. Incoming Chat Request from: Ernestine. Incoming Chat Request from: Juggernaut. Incoming Chat Request from: Jenny. Okay, guys, just hang in there, I will get to your questions in a minute. Just need to get to the bottom of this. Code? 2001. This Terry? That's him. I'm FaceTiming him. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. Ryan. Terry, howzit, man. Listen, can you... do me a favor? Can you look through my stuff for an old passport of mine? Passport? Ja, I'm just trying to check the date on an old visa stamp. And where's this? In your room? Ja, just behind the door, there's some white boxes. Ja, there's one that says 'office' on the side. Office. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... Terry, help me, man, I've been kidnapped! You've gotto call the cops, please, man! What the -?! Why the fuck did you do that? I mean, what is wrong with you? I'm trying to give you a chance to clear your name! No, no, don't, don't! I don't want to but if you keep pulling this shit, then I will have to. It's him again. So what do you want me to do now? Why this reluctance, Ryan? Just answer it. You're not gonna pull this same shit? No, I swear. Ryan. Terry. I lost you there for a second. What were you saying? No, nothing, man. So? Ja, no, I found a passport, but it's got the current date on. Oh, no. Okay. No, no, I need one that expired about five years ago. Nope. Are you sure? Dude, I checked all the boxes, this is only passport here. Okay. What time you coming back? I don't know. This could go late. Where are you? I'm just having dinner with some girl I met the other night. Okay, okay. Say no more. I won't wait up. I'll see you later. Bye. Okay. Bye. So you... You knew that it wasn't there. No. And then you thought no, maybe it was. So when he said that he found one, you panicked, and that's why you shouted that stuff, because you wanted me to cut that call. Jesus, what the hell is wrong with you? You knew that that passport is not going to say the 24th, because on the 24th, you were here! Why won't you just fucking admit it?! Those paintings, those are hers, right? As you would very well know, yes. I see there's one there of Kali, the Hindu goddess, destroyer of evil forces. I know who Kali is. What about it? Just saying it's a... it's a natural urge, you know... we all want justice, and... when something terrible happens, it's... in every culture, it's universal, the... the Egyptians had Sekhmet, who could breathe fire. The Greeks had the Furies, who would hound men who defied the natural order and drive them insane. But even the Furies got it wrong from time to time. Ryan, shut up. Of course, they're not to blame... Ryan. Shut up! Okay? Enough with all the mansplaining. Let's just see what the people have to say, yeah? You have 1,957 followers. You have 47 new messages. Okay, so they haven't shut us down yet, that says something. Incoming Chat Request. Incoming Chat Request from: Ernestine. Okay, remember, guys... we are streaming on multiple platforms so if your feed does go down, you can flick over to PeepStar, or Lifestream or ClariScope... the whole lot. And if all those go down, there's a channel in Estonia called Libertycast. They will stream anything. I mean, their bandwidth isn't great, but whatever shit goes down here tonight, they will stream it. Okay. So... Ernestine has been waiting the longest. Ernestine, you're on. Hello? You're on, Ernestine. I can't believe what you're doing. I can't believe it. I think it's fucking amazing what you're doing. So I used to know your sister. We worked together at the deli. And I knew something was wrong. I just... saw her one time. After. I... Go on. It was like the light had gone out in her eyes, and when I asked her what was wrong, she said "Nothing". Men have been getting away with fucking murder for so long. And it's like when it comes down to it, it's he said, she said and it's like... that fucking... Brett Kavanaugh. Did you follow that shit? It just makes me so mad. And I keep hearing that this shit just keeps happening. So... You do what you gotta do, sis. Cause we're right here. We've got your back. Thank you, Ernestine. The feeling is mutual. All right, um... K P A C underscore H Q 2. Yeah, you're on. This is performance art, right? Wrong. No. - No, this isn't... not real, no ways. - Google #justiceforayanda. Everything is there. Police case reports, how she died. It's all there. I'm sorry to say, it is very real. Okay, so how... How are you going to do this? I'm going to get him to confess. And if he just doesn't? Then... you vote. Us? Based on what? You know 45% of people on social media think the earth is flat; we are probably the worst possible jury. Do you think that we are gonna apply our minds? Do you think that we're gonna bring critical thinking to bear? Just... then... log off. I will. Don't do it. I'm appalled at this. This is completely unacceptable. You should be ashamed of yourself. We'll see. Maybe. But all I know is that at the end of the day, the truth will come out. And then what? I mean, you're going to have to let this guy go eventually, right? I mean, you're not planning on killing him, right? Right? Hello, Zola, I'm Cindy from Westonaria, and I'm with you, and every woman in this country who suffered abuse at the hands of these bloody men. Our so-called brothers. They constantly abuse us, and we've been quiet for too long, alone. Guys, I just logged on to this, I don't know what's going on, but this... this is whack. This is lit! Oh, I'm glued. I'm going out tonight, that's for sure. I wanna see if she's going to do it. Like, go all the way. Can I just say that I'm a thousand percent behind you? That's all I really have to say. We are listening, sister. Take your time, make your case, you've waited long for this. We are so fucking tired of these patriarchal, misogynistic pigs. Hello... Zola. This is Jenny from Rape Alert in the UK. I just want to thank you for the press release that we received. What you're going through must be incredibly difficult, and our hearts do go out to you. That said, Zola, we strongly feel that the way you are going about this... Regardless of whether that man there is innocent or guilty, quite apart from that, there are legal processes, however imperfect... What processes, Jenny? Well, there are options... civil, criminal, restorative justice - My sister is dead. There is no restoration. There's no turning back the clock. And whatever DNA samples, if they ever took any, have long since been lost. The only hope that I have is to get that guy to admit to you and to the rest of the world to what he did. And if he won't? He will. Zola, listen to me, please. I hear you, Jenny. And if there were any other way... I've tried everything. Thank you for your call. Okay. I think it's time I gave you guys an explanation as to how we even got here. Okay, so the flight landed twelve minutes ago, and I think that's the first of the passengers now. Oh, wow, look at that, he's just updated his Facebook status. Way too long, Ryan Hunt. Way too f- Oh, shit. There he is. That's him. Oh, my God. I can't believe this is h- Okay, it's definitely him. Looks like we're getting a rental. Hey, ja, I'm just getting into town. No, it's cool, I think he's going to - Shit. Where is he? Where's he? The slippery fuck. Where the fuck did he - Gotcha. Okay, I almost lost him, but we're back on track, we're heading north. Look at the dinky little car he rented. Flashy fuck. Spending his pounds, no doubt. Looks like he's taking the off-ramp... up towards Terry's place. Okay. He's here. It's a house on Milton Road. He's back. Okay... So... It's ten past nine. I've been out here for almost seven hours. I'm dying to pee, but with my luck he comes out just as I'm going. I'm starting to realize he's not going to come out, he's tired. Oh! Alright. Alright, bladder's just gonna have to burst. Here we go. There he goes... out and about. Flying solo, which is perfect. This is too good. Hi. Hi. You are too sweet. Nonsense, it's my pleasure. Cheers. Cheers. My name's Ryan, by the way. I'm Zola. Do I know you? Have we met before? I don't think so. Are you from around here? Ja, but I've actually been overseas for... Jeez, almost ten years now. Just got back today. No ways. Serious? And so? What's it like being back? So far, so good. You've been stalking me since I got back. No, Ryan, I've been stalking you for way longer than that. I've been waiting for years for you to come back. Tell me... what made you decide to come home? Did you rape someone in London? No. Jesus, I... It was time, I... I got sick of appraising old paintings. I missed being here. I missed the weather, the people... What do I have to say to convince you, Zola? You've made a big mistake. I'm not the guy. You're good. If I didn't know you any better, I might even believe you. Please! Just believe me, please. Seriously, please - Okay, is she on the line? Who're you talking to? None of your fucking business. Okay... So... The prosecution calls its first witness. Okay. I can see you. Can you hear me? I can hear you. Shall I just begin? Yeah, go ahead. In your own words. Um... okay... I... As you can see, I'm... I'm not revealing my identity. I've agreed to this because I think it's important, but... I've seen Ryan's nasty side, and to be honest, I'm really afraid. Who are you? Okay, so... this is going back to the late nineties now. I was... I was at school with Ryan. Oh, this is too much. Ignore him. Just go on. We weren't good friends, but we moved in the same crowd - If you're going to come and accuse me then at least have the fucking balls - - Ryan, shut the fuck up! - To show your face! I will not shut up! What gives you the right to - No! Aargh! Let her speak. Um... okay... uh... So we used to go and drink at this hotel near the station. They didn't seem to have a problem selling booze to underage kids, so we used to go there quite a lot. A whole gang of us, and we used to get drunk. People used to go up to the roof of the building to smoke joints and get off with each other. And one night I went up there... and that's when I saw... He was on the far side of the roof and there was no one else there, just him and this girl, her name was Stacey. And he had her... he was holding her hair, like... a fistful of hair. And he had his... he had an erection and he was physically forcing her face down into his crotch. Bullshit! I can still see it now. This is complete bullshit. For all we know, this is just some friend of yours. There's no such thing as an anonymous witness. Everyone who's watching this can smell a rat right now. This is a complete fucking setup. Did you do anything to stop it? To this day I wish I had, but... No, not... Did you tell anyone? Not until a few days later I started asking around about him at school. Turns out... Oh, go to hell. Quite a few of the girls had had... How should I say it? Difficulties. He had a reputation. A pattern of behavior? A pattern of behavior. For the record, I contacted the girl that you're speaking of... Stacey. She didn't want to talk to me about it. Stacey Kinnock. That's because there's zero truth to this. Stacey was my girlfriend throughout the whole of Standard Eight and Standard Nine, and I would never, never have forced her to do anything that she didn't want to do. Never. And fuck you, whoever you are, for... Do you know how many people are watching this? Do you have any idea what this is going to do to my reputation? There are 9,724 viewers across all platforms. And none of you have called the cops? None of you have reported this? What the hell is wrong with everybody? This is real. I am real. I am here, tied to a fucking chair! Actually, there are three platforms that have shut us down already, but that still leaves nine. And the fact is, Ryan, what people want to know is the truth. If you did rape Ayanda, if you are responsible for her suicide, then the matter of you being tied up and being interrogated is of insignificant inconvenience, wouldn't you say? You tell him, Zola. Just listen to the sound of the white boy's tears pouring down. Mm-hm. Delicious. Pour me another glass, please. Please. One more. Hey, Ryan. Drink your own medicine, you white motherfucking rapist, racist motherfucker. You deserve everything. Everything. This is freaking me out. This is not normal activity. I mean... He's going down. Motherfucker's gonna burn. I don't know who's right and who's wrong here, but this is freaking awesome. True people's justice. This is how all trials should be. Live. Online. Where anyone can say anything. If he didn't rape her... what is the story, here? I mean, was she's suffering from depression? Zola, it's Jenny from Rape Alert again. Okay, look... You've clearly been planning this a long time, and I can see that you're not about to... All I'm asking is that you don't do anything stupid, okay? Maybe put the Taser thing to one side. You have him restrained... he's not going to hurt you. It's important for you to keep the moral high ground. If you start torturing him, he becomes the victim. Guys, listen... Please, just listen to the experts. This is not a game. There's lives at stake here. Zola? Zola, are you there? Zola, it's me, it's your mother. Please pick up. Zola, what's going on there, my child? Everyone is calling me and telling me what's going on. I can't believe it. Zola? Yes, ma... What's up? You are disgracing the memory of your sister, my child. Ma, I'm doing this for her. I'm doing it for all of us. Zola, for God's sake, this is not going to bring your sister back. She needs justice. This is not how I raised you, Zola. Please, you have to stop this right now. I can't Ma. I've gone too far. And what will the people say, my child? Don't force me to phone the police. So now you'd call the police? But when Ayanda was raped you wouldn't - Stop it! Zola, you are busy dragging these things into the light. You're making fools of us. We've worked so hard to get past this. We haven't moved past it, Ma. Not as long as this person is still around. Zola... My child... allow your sister to rest in peace. No, she can't rest in peace, Ma, while this man is walking free. Even if that was the guy - It is him Ma, it's him! I beg you, Ma, just keep watching! Just give me half an hour more to make my case. Okay? This is him, Ma. This is the man that took Ayanda away from us. I beg you, Ma, he needs... He needs to pay for what he did. Let her finish talking. What's that one saying? She's started starting to... What? Who's there with you? It's Osmo, my child. Since when? Zola, it's only temporary. He's staying there with you? He needed a place to stay, for a bit, mainly just on the weekend. He's old now, he's working out in Edenvale. He's been through a lot. Hello, baby girl. Zola? I need to go. Zola, p- Who's Osmo? Is he your mama's boyfriend? He's no one. He's just some freeloader who... sponged off my mum for as long as I can remember. Now, we need to get on with this... Where were we? Evidence. Testimony. Patterns of behavior, yeah. I need to pee. You already did. Please, I'm serious. Then pee your fucking pants. I don't give a shit. It's getting late. We need to press on. Evidence... Testimony... what's next? So what kind of a name is Osmo? Shut up! Just shut the fuck up, okay? It has nothing to do with anything. You wanna piss? Get the fuck up, okay? Come, walk. Get the fuck up! Walk. Okay, man, Jesus! Just relax! Don't tell me to fucking relax. You fucking relax. In there. Piss. You've got to untie me first. Go to hell. Just one hand. Oh, God, no. Please don't. Is that what my sister said to you? Shit, I can't fucking do this. I should have just let you pee in your pants. Now piss! So this Osmo guy is more than just a sponge, right? - That has nothing to do with you - He hurts her, doesn't he? - Shut up. - Did he hurt Ayanda? What the fuck do you care? You hurt Ayanda. You! Get up. Up! On your fucking feet. No, no, no, no! Zola! Stop. Don't. What the fuck? What are you doing? Please, baby, just... Just put it down, please. Kwela Kid? Look, you need to calm down. I am fucking calm. You need to get the fuck back in there. Okay, okay. I will. I will. Okay. Zola, it's me. It's me, baby. It's okay. All right? We always knew this was going to be tough. We're doing good, yeah? We just... got to keep it together. Okay? All right. Not let it get on top of us, alright? Alright? It's okay. It's okay. Alright... Back to business. Okay? Get up. Come on, get up. Get up. Sit down. Gimme your hand. I said "hand"! What happened in there? What's going on? I don't know what you're talking about. Who's Osmo? He's nobody. He's just this complete loser. He used to hang around the house when we were kids. Okay, so what does that have to do with Ayanda? Nothing. There's no connection. He's just this asshole that I thought was gone. Ja, well you need to put him out of your mind. I just... I just can't believe my mom took him back. Zola! You've got, like, a thousand people watching this thing. You can't afford to be worrying about your mom and that guy. Need to get your head back in the game. You understand? Zola, are you hearing me? Ja. Okay. Ja. You haven't made the case yet. You're gonna have to go back to the diary. Okay... So for an explanation... The guy that you just saw is my friend. He's my... He's my boyfriend. We've been on this journey together now for two years, and he's been helping me with moderating chat comments, switching cameras and all that tech stuff, you know? And yes, he was the first caller, and maybe that was a mistake, but um... yeah, anyway, he says that I haven't made it clear why I believe that RH is Ryan Hunt. So... Ryan, when you were in your final year of post-grad, where did you live? No, I'm done with this. It's an easy question. Your character witness is anonymous, and one of your callers turns out to be your boyfriend. None of this is for real. Why are you doing this to me, hey? Why me? Why? All I am asking for is an address. It is not a big deal. Fine. Suit yourself. You don't have to tell me. Because I have your university fees invoice for 2012. 44 Rondor Crescent. Is that your address? You deny it? Okay. Let us go to Ayanda's diary. November 7th. It was a Saturday. 44 Rondor. Which proves nothing. There were three of us living there, it could have been any one of us. Oh, ja, it could have been you, Mike Kerrigan, Jacqui Searle, right? I do my homework, Ryan I'm not making this shit up. This is how it went down... A few days later, before New Years, Ayanda hung herself. In her flat, alone. No note, nothing. It was only when they did the autopsy that it was revealed that she was raped. She hadn't reported it. My mother... I only found Ayanda's diary six months later. God, I was so young, I didn't even have the strength to go through it to try and figure out the clues. It took years, and by then you'd already gone. But I tracked down your old housemates. And guess what? They remembered my sister. And they said that she had been at your flat a couple of times. It's not true. It is true. So prove it. Why don't you call them as witnesses in this bullshit trial you've got going on? I don't need to. I have something far stronger than their word. Jacqui Searle gave this to me. She said that it was taken in the winter of that year. So when you said you didn't know my sister, I knew you were lying. And now all these people watching know it to. Okay. Okay, I admit, I knew Ayanda. I tutored her. We even had a thing for a couple of weeks, but it was against faculty policy. She was a student, so we didn't really go out much. I was going to go overseas anyway after post-grad, so... So on Christmas Eve we were going to hook up for drinks, but instead I broke up with her. In her flat. And that's that. She didn't even seem particularly upset. I left, and I went home. So you were lying about the passport? Of course. What do you expect? Look at me! You lure me here, you electrocute me, I'm completely fucking terrified of you. So when did you fly out, Ryan? I don't know, a couple of days later, I suppose. Before or after she killed herself? I didn't even know that she had. This is honestly the first I've heard of it. But you did have sex with her? I'm really, really sorry that - Answer me. Did you have sex with her? When? Ever? Sure, of course. On the 24th. No, Jeez, I just told you... we broke up. Look... all I can think is that after I left, someone must have got in and attacked her. No, no. Do not believe a word this guy says. I have seen men like this my entire life. They know exactly how to play these lies. 'Cos that's what it boils down to... it's just lies, heaped onto more lies. He's a liar. And you have every right to take justice into your own hands. As a matter of fact, that's what you have to do as a woman. What did you mean when you said... she'll call the cops for this guy, but not your sister? It seems like there's some unresolved family thing there. Like, has your sister done something that makes your mom, like, not trust her at all? Like not believe her at all? Okay, so if he didn't rape her... then what's the story? Was she depressed? Or is it like a psychological thing happening? Or is it like - Tell you the truth, this is fucked up. If I was this guy, I would sue your ass! This Osmo guy... You don't have the right! - I mean what's all that about? - Are you sure she was raped? How can you be certain that it wasn't consensual? You say he raped your sister and he said he broke up with her. Am I missing something? I mean, what the fuck? Something is... - What if the guy's telling the truth? - This is stupid. Did your sister kill herself because she got raped? Seriously, you must examine your brain. - You start a livestream... - Or maybe... Sooner or later, someone you know is gonna see this. And then you are gonna be in such trouble, girl. The is deeply problematic - What you're doing is not right. Have you thought about what's going to happen if he's innocent? How do you know it wasn't consensual? How can you be sure? Who made you the judge of this guy? I'm sorry but you are what's wrong with everything in society today. You have no right. None at all! Shame on you. Are we crazy? Is this completely fucked up? Have I made a terrible mistake? Zola, no. After all we've been through... Zola, we know that he did it. Do we? I don't... I don't fucking know any more. I mean... you're hearing what they're saying. What if it isn't true? Zola, baby... The autopsy, the bruises... Someone did all that to her. If not him, who else? Don't start doubting this, not now. I don't know. Okay? I just don't fucking know. Well, that's why we have them. The wisdom of the crowd, right? Hey... We need to play the clip. No. We don't have a choice. They need to feel what you feel. It's not a head thing. It's right... It's right here. I can't, okay, I don't wanna ever see it again. I know you don't, but - She called the cops. I knew she would. It's probably nothing. No, I don't know, just listen. Okay, okay. We figured something like this might happen. Okay, just breathe. 735 flats on the street, they can't go knocking on every single door. Okay? Okay. What's going on? There they are. Is that him? He's lost weight. Who? What? Oh, come on! You're out of luck, Ryan. You've got the world's worst detective on your case. In case you get any ideas. Let me play the clip, Zola. You know we have to. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay, um... There is one more thing I would like you guys to see. It's something that I found years later... on this... iPod. For you guys that are too young to remember, this was like a phone, but without the phone. It had a really crappy camera and like 50 megs of memory. Ayanda had one, and she recorded a file on this. Look at what he did to me. It's pretty disgusting. He really... He really hurt me. Here... here... and here. Just look. This is where he stepped on me. He stood on me... And then... And then my mom... my mom says it's my fault because I let him in. So what I was expecting? And as far as I know, those were the last words my sister ever said. Incoming chat request. Incoming chat request from: Detective T Vygies. Now this is Tertius Vygies, the cop assigned to investigate her death. Detective Vygies. Ms. Kunene. Long time. I assume you've been watching. Your mother's very worried about you, Zola. We all are. You're in a lot of trouble, you know that? I don't see I really had any other choice. What you're doing here is not gonna solve anything. Since you lost the fucking evidence. That was the laboratory, Zola, not us. And you can blame whoever you want, it's not going to bring your sister back. What do you want, Vygies? Why did you call me? I want you to end this. Let the guy go. Where are you? As you can see, I'm at Ayanda's old flat. No, you're not. Because I'm right outside and I just woke up the current occupants. So what now? How's the guy holding up? His name is Ryan Hunt, as you would know if you'd ever read any of my emails. Don't start that. I followed every bloody lead you gave me and none of it went anywhere. You were patronizing, dismissive, and completely useless. You can insult me however much you like... I'm not your enemy, Zola. We all want this to end well for everyone. You're making very big assumptions there, Vygies. So how's he holding up? He's working through some issues right now. He looks quite angry... but he's alive, for now. Zola, don't do anything stupid now. What do you expect, when the cops do nothing? Find nothing. Must people just sit back and accept? And do nothing? We're all upset about what happened - Don't you dare equate my feelings to your own. You had nine years, Vygies... and you did nothing. So I am doing something, okay? Do you hear me? I am doing something! Cut this call. Wait! There's something you don't know. There's a way of knowing if it is him... for sure. What are you talking about? Look, I can't give you the details... Look, just tell me where you are, and I'll be able to take one look at the guy, and I'll know if he's the one that - Don't try to play me, Vygies. Kill this call. He had nine fucking years. He achieved nothing. Fuck him. Okay... Okay, well, you've heard what I have to say. You've seen the diary, you've watched the clip, the photos. You've heard this asshole lie and squirm and say anything to try and get himself off the hook. Now it's time for you to consider your verdict. No, no, wait a minute. Just a second. What? What about the defense? If this is a trial and you're the prosecution, then it's my turn to argue my case. You've been arguing your case this whole time. Zola, you said you wanted justice for your sister. Now did you mean it? Or did you just mean vengeance? Because there's a big difference. Okay. Um... What's wrong, Ryan? Nothing to say in your own defense? Okay... Just this... I don't have any evidence to present. I have no witnesses. I'm tied up. I had no warning that this was going to happen to me. But I do just have this to say... to anyone out there who gives a shit about really finding out the truth. I cannot prove my innocence beyond a shadow of doubt. But here's the thing... I don't need to. There's something called 'the burden of proof' and it's on her. The person who has to prove their case is the person who levels the accusation. That's the way it works in all courtrooms around the world. The defense doesn't have to prove their innocence. They just have to show that the prosecution can't prove their guilt. Beyond doubt... beyond reasonable doubt. And what you've heard here this evening leaves so much doubt. So much fucking doubt. Yes, those were my initials in her diary. Does that prove that I raped her? No. There's a perfectly boring explanation... we were seeing each other. And, yes, I lied about that at first. Does that prove anything? No. All it proves is that I was assaulted and tied up, and afraid. That's all that proves. That's all. Now, this woman, she... What is it, are we done? I want to call a witness. Who? You. Why me? You've asked me a million questions here this evening. All I ask is a chance to do the same. That's fair, right? It's like you said, Zola... people are watching. Whatever you choose will impact on the way they judge you. So please... just sit down somewhere that a camera can see you. Okay? Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth - Just fucking get on with it. Okay, fine. Right. Sure. So, your sister... Ayanda. Did she... Was she... ever... before this incident... Did she have a history? Was she ever raped or assaulted before? What the fuck does that have to do with anything? Please, just answer. The truth. No, there is no relevance to that. You're on trial here, not Ayanda. Your mother's boyfriend, this... this Osmo character. Did he ever assault your sister? Enough. Okay, just stop. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Then why don't you tell me? I mean, there's obviously some sort of story here. Do you have any questions about Ayanda or are we done? He hurt her, didn't he? No. What makes you so sure that it wasn't him that raped her that night? Did he know where she lived? It wasn't him. You don't know that. I am telling you. You can't know. Ask questions. Don't make statements. Or are we done? How do you know that it wasn't him? Fuck off. Answer the question. Fuck you! You're lying. I am not lying. You expect people to believe you? Just answer the fucking question. It has nothing to do with anything. How can you possibly know? Because she was too fucking old for him! Osmo was only ever into kids. He hurt you. So what? And all of this... This is your way of getting back at him. No. At men. At every man who's ever assaulted - or attacked, or raped any woman - Shut up, okay, shut up. - Anywhere in the world. - Shut up! Shut up! Okay? Shut up! This is about you. No one else! You! What you did to Ayanda! Zola! I got you. I got you. Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. I never told anyone. It's okay. Incoming chat request. Incoming chat request from: Abigail 22. Listen, hey, hey... You don't have to answer that. Okay? You don't have to answer it. Zola. So now you know, Ma. My child... How can you say these things in public? Have you lost your mind?! Oh, really, Ma? Is that what you have to say? Zola... Where's Osmo? He's in the other room, and he's furious. So he's still there now. Where else would he be? You heard what I said, and still you didn't kick him out? I am old, Zola... I'm old. You want me to die alone? Hey? Is that what you want? I want you to stand up for me, Ma. It's all in the past, Zola. You're talking about history. Forgive and forget. He's a changed man, he's working now, he's got a job... and I don't know why you're coming with all these accusations. Ma, how can you even say that? Zola, what will people say? I don't care what they say. Let them say whatever they want. They'll say I didn't look after you. That I didn't care. Ma, your boyfriend raped me for years. He raped me in your own house - I didn't know, Zola. I didn't know! How could you not know? You have to believe me - How could you not know, Ma? You should have known! When Ayanda was raped you kept quiet, you didn't even tell police, and now you're doing the same thing with Osmo! Ma, when are you ever going to learn? My child - Reasonable doubt. We need to finish this. Okay, so it is up to you now. I have done all that I can. I've made my case. And I will live with your verdict. When you get there, you will see two buttons... Guilty... and Not Guilty. You get one click each. You have five minutes to deliver your verdict. What does it say? 233 guilty, 41 not guilty. He's guilty. He's fucking guilty, and they see it. Why didn't you tell me? What happened between you and Osmo. Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't. Well, you should have. Don't be angry. I'm not angry. I thought... no secrets. There are no secrets. Then what the hell? I thought we were in this together. I mean, I'm here risking everything, and... you're holding back? Because this has nothing to do with that. These are two different things. Are they? David speak, what is it you want to say? I just don't see how what happened with Osmo can't have impacted on... on this. So basically you're on his side. No. Jesus, Zola... Have I ever been anything but on your side? Then why can't you see? Why do they have to be related? Because they are. They must be. You've been going through all these years with all this trauma - So what? So how do you know that your judgment isn't being clouded by your rage? Don't do this. I'm not doing anything, I'm just asking a question. You're asking the same question that he's asking... whether I'm some man-hating, ball-breaking bitch with a vengeance. Would you be asking me the same thing if I was a man? Huh? If I was some dude that was chasing down his wife's killer, would you say it's because I hate men? Exactly. Your question is not a question, David, it's a statement. And that statement makes you part of the same patriarchy as him. Aah, fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck you. Fuck you, Zola! I'm here. I'm right here with you. But you don't believe me. I'm having my doubts, yes. What's happening? What's changed? 334, 48, 51... David, what the fuck? Oh, fuck. This is not happening, shit, no. This is not happening. What are we gonna do if this doesn't go our way? Zola, please... the gun. What about it? You're waving it around, just please put it down. Answer my question. We gamed it, Zola! Jeez, we gamed it every which fucking way. We stick to the plan... he signs the waiver and he walks. Fuck that! Hive-mind, sweetheart. The wisdom of the crowd? This crowd knows nothing. If this keeps going - I will not betray my sister. You will not ask me to betray my sister. Zola, what is the point of having a trial if you're just going to ignore the jury? Okay, so I did it wrong. I let Osmo get to me. I didn't make my case. But that doesn't make him innocent. I will get a confession out of him. That's what it's for. Zola, please... just give me the gun. I can't do that. You are not thinking straight! No. I've had it. These guilty fuckers walk free every single day. There's no accountability. No one pays the price for their actions. And it just keeps getting worse, every single day. I mean, you turn on the news and it's children getting raped and women getting killed and burnt and broken. And the cops, they have it in for all the wrong people. Evidence just keeps going missing over and over and over again. Powerful men, they get away with everything. And name one politician that isn't corrupt. And the rich, meanwhile, the rich are getting richer and crazier and uglier. And... everything's for sale. Everything! Your data's being harvested. Social media is just full of stupidity and hatred and anger and this vile, dumb rage. And everybody's got an opinion but none of it matters. None of it! Why won't it all just stop?! Fine. Cut him loose. What was that? Ryan. Shit. Where the fuck did he go? Ryan? Listen, man, the voting's done. You've won. You're free to go. Ryan, you hear that? Ryan? He's not there. Check playback. I'll check the kitchen. No, wait - Mother-fuck! Hey! Hey! Don't fucking move. Unlock that door. Or what? You gonna to shoot me with the whole world watching? No one's watching, Ryan. The live feed is down. Look. Hey! Zola! I'm okay. Open the door. Give me that key. And then? What happens next? You walk out. You're free to go. Come on! Jesus Christ, Zola, open the fucking door - David... just turn the cameras back on, dude. David, don't do it! Not yet. Just do the right thing, man. I didn't ask for any of this. I am the victim here. What's happened here tonight is abuse. So please... just turn the cameras back on before she does something really fucking stupid, okay? The whole world is watching, Zola. You lost. Get over it. David, what the fuck did you do that for? Turn off the fucking cameras, David! Just open the fucking door! Go to hell, Ryan, this is not over! Ms. Kunene... I really shouldn't be telling you this. But if something happens to that guy and I didn't tell you? You gotto look at the report, the coroner's report. You've got a copy, right? It's on the third page. It's been blacked out. It's what we call a hold back. Information we don't release in order to verify a confession, if we ever get one. But you need to know what it says. According to the bruises on your sister's body... the assailant had a dinstinguishing characteristic. At some point, he held her down with his foot. From the bruising, they say it seems as if he's missing one of his toes. The second toe on the right foot. If that guy that you've got has got all his digits, he's not your guy. So please, just check, and let him go, unharmed. Just open this fucking door! Show me your foot. Turn around and show me your fucking foot! This is fucking ridiculous, you told me I'm free to go! Show me your fucking foot! Fuck, okay! Okay. Jesus. Down. Get down on your fucking knees! You fucking bitch. You just couldn't fucking let it go, could you? Everything is fucked now because of you. No, wait, wait, wait! Please just tell me why. Tell me why you did it. What did Ayanda ever do to you? I don't know. How can you not fucking know? It just happened. You ruined all our lives and you don't even know why! Why should I? Why the fuck... No, no, no! I should have done this fucking years ago. Jesus... What the fuck? You didn't really think I was gonna shoot you, did you? Two live rounds... to scare the shit out of you... and seven blanks to force the confession. I may be a lot of things, but I'm not a murderer. We're at 304 Forest Heights. Vygies, Ma, anyone... we're across the road from Ayanda's place. We need help. David? David. No. David, no! David, no, no, no... hang in there, okay? You're okay. Someone will come. Somebody call an ambulance! David, hang in there. Hang in there, my love. I'm so sorry. No, no, no. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. No, no, no. David, no, no, no! David. No. No! He's dead. Was Ayanda... Was she the only one? And if things had happened differently, would I have been next? No. Fuck, who knows? Maybe... It wasn't in my mind, but my... My mind is a... deeply messed up place. She left me a message, you know? On Christmas Day... she said she needed me. Said she needed to see me. I was busy, I said. So I figured I'd come around over the weekend, and... that's when I found her. Yeah. What did you just do? What? You looked over there. Where? No... Where I found her. She was hanging right fucking there. How could you possibly know that, unless... She was... She was gonna tell the whole world what had happened. So you killed her. I went round to her place, you know, to... to say that I was sorry, but she... she was so angry, man. She... she kept saying that she was going to report me, and... we fought, and... So, you know, I... I had her by the neck. I was... I was just trying to... stop her, you know, trying to shut her up, but... And then... So I made it look like a suicide. Booked my ticket, and I was gone. All these years, I... I blamed myself. It'll all come out in court. I thought it was me. They're coming back... Listen. I've got to wash my face. Hey... Go to Hell. Zola? It's me, my child... your mother. Open up, please. Ma? What do you want? I want to be here for you, my child. I'm asking that you open up, please. I'm sorry. The whole world saw him try to kill himself. Who's to say he didn't succeed?
