All right kids, Roger Carol here. Excuse me I was just handed this announcement. Let's see what we've got here. Bad news, the Lake Arrowhead Dance Pavilion will not be open this summer. Seems the promoters had other commitments, and everybody who was scheduled to work on Monday is now notified not to report. Tough break, so get busy finding yourselves other jobs, but not until Donnie Brooks but... That's great, that puts us out of a job for the summer. Look I turned down that lifeguard offer at the beach, oh brother. Well, may as well turn around and head back to LA. Hey wait, that job with dad is still open. Maybe he could hire both of you. Thanks, Cindy, but... But what? What's wrong with working for my father. Look, Cindy, we've been through this before. He doesn't need me, it would be just a handout. I don't understand you, you're so touchy about money. Not money, charity, let's drop it. Hey wait a minute, wait a minute, I just got an idea. Why don't we take over the Dance Pavilion. I have a friend who's with National Town who can get us some swingin' groups. Between the two of us we come up with a couple hundred dollars. We just might do it. Let's go on up to Arrowhead and talk to Mr. Johnson, manager of the village. What do we got to lose? Uh $200. Well, it's worth a try. Well, it's okay by me. Man, I got a feeling this is gonna be a swingin' summer. # Ooh ooh ah ooh # # We're gonna have a swingin' summer # # For a fun to water ski # # Until there's no more sunscreen # # Watusi all night # # We're gonna do it up right # # It's gonna be a swingin' summer # # We're gonna have a summertime we won't forget # # Then we'll sleep # # And baby you can bet # # When the summer is gone # # All the memories will live on a good summer # # Remember # # Gonna see it up at the lake # # Each man my joy that will take # # We'll make our plans while holding hands # # We'll kiss and then we'll love our summertime # # A perfect time to fall in love # # And all the dreams that we've been dreaming of # # Are gonna all come true this summer too # # You'll see this summer, swingin' summer # # Swingin' summer fun # # Wah wah ooh # # Swingin' summer fun # # Wah wah ooh # # Swingin' summer full of fun # # Wah wah ooh # # Swingin' summer full of fun # # Wah wah ooh # You wait here, I'll see if Mr. Johnson is in. Oh, if you geniuses can pull this off, you'll make enough money to put yourself through next semester. You know, if we handle the dances right, I mean, you know, get some good name groups and the right promotion, we'll be able to make enough money to put ourself through post-grad. Oh, Mickey, I'm so excited. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that Rick can sell Mr. Johnson on the idea. That son of a gun, at last, dental school. Dr. Howell and James at your service. We fill 'em and we pull 'em. You sound like you're running a gas station. Funny, that's very funny. Funny thing you just said. He's not here, he's over at the lodge having lunch by the pool. Oh good, let's go over there and see him. Mr. Johnson, we'd like to speak to you for a moment, please. Why certainly, Mr. Wallace and I have finished our business. What can I do for you? Sir, I'm Rick Howell. How do you do? Cindy Foster and Mickey James. - Oh, oh. - Hello, sir. This young man is Turk Wallace, our head lifeguard. Turk Wallace, the all-American. Among other things. Sir, we heard your announcement on the radio. Oh yes, the cancellation, I'm sorry about that boys. Are you part of the group that was due to work here? Yes sir, that's why we wanted to talk to you. We'd, we'd like the opportunity of putting on the dances ourselves. Well that's all well and good, but it'll take a great deal of money. How much money you boys have? $200 right now, but we're planning on deferring some of the payments till after the first weekend. You see, a friend of Rick's is an agent, and of course he could line us up with some talent. We'd give the performers a percentage of the gate, and give you at least two weeks rent on Sunday night after the opening. That is of course if your price isn't too high. I'm afraid it's more than the rent boys. There are certain guarantees that have to be made to the performers, and if you're not able to live up to your obligations you will get into a great deal of trouble. If we could just have a one-week trial period, that's all. As manager of Lake Arrowhead Village, I have its reputation to consider. If your plans fall through, gives a village a bad name, performers will be afraid to appear here. Well, how much money do we need to cover the first weekend? Oh, $1,000. $1,000? I'm afraid you just put us out of business, Mr. Johnson, Temporarily that is. Oh I'm sorry boys, I really wish I could help you. Thanks anyway, Mickey, let's go. My sunglasses, I left them on the table. I'll be right back. Okay, we'll meet you at the car. Mr. Johnson, my father is John Posture. Oh yes, I know him. You have a house here on the lake. Well he would put up the money and make those guarantees or whatever. I'll have him call you tonight. Well, that changes the whole picture. But please, don't tell Rick. I see. You have a boyfriend who likes to do things on his own. Man, has he got problems. Well, I'd like to pretend that you just changed your mind. I have now. This place could be a gold mine. We've got to raise that money. Well, if you ask me, Rick, I think we oughta take those jobs from Cindy's father. Look, Mickey, I'm telling you the same thing I told Cindy, no charity. All right, all right, got any other ideas. Yeah, I'm gonna call that agent, see if he can get some groups to come up here on a percentage. Hey, that's a good idea. Quick, who's the sharpest businesswoman you know? What, what are you talking about? Oh, I just talked Mr. Johnson into letting us have the pavilion for one weekend. - You did? - Hey. Well, what'd you say to him? I um, I played on his sympathy. Come on, let's go, we got lots of work to do. Wait a second, we should go back and thank him. Oh, no, no, no, he said not to bother because you have so much work to be done, go on. Hello, this is Rick Howell. Oh that's great, Mr. Brown, I can't thank you enough. You'll receive your contracts tomorrow. Yes, I'll take care of that too. Thanks again, bye. Who's the call from? The Rip Chord's manager. You mean they can make it after all? You bet they can. Oh, that's great, now all we have to worry about is The Righteous Brothers, and then the entertainment's all set. Cindy, I've got a feeling we're gonna be here all summer long. Now get to work. Speaking of work, Shirley, where's Van Gogh. Mickey, I don't know. He probably went to cut off his ear. Not even that would help his artwork. But it could do wonders for a certain romance. I mean, alone at last. Are you trying to seduce me? Whatever gave you that idea? Ah yes, the sweet smell of honest sweat. Horse's sweat, men perspire, and women glow. Women glow, well if that's what you're doing, I like it. Say, don't you elves ever take a break. Sounds tempting, but no thanks. That's what I like, dedication. Oh, that reminds me, aren't you the lifeguard around here? Head lifeguard. Remind me not to go swimming. Well it's not exactly my type of work, but then who wants his allowance cut off? Are you saying your father forced you to take this job. Poor guy, strictly the hard way uptight, right? Believes in work. And what do you believe in? Myself, good day ladies. Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou going? Thank you, ma'am. Oh, I dropped my hammer. # Wow # Oh, sir, could I leave my sign here? Sure, go ahead, son. Thank you, sir. Wanna join us? Sure, why not. Thanks, I'm really having a good time. Ha ha, fooled you. - Look up. - Oh! Oh no, are you okay? Oh no, I'm all right. - Oh. - Oh, okay. Oh no, oh it does hurt, oh yes. Oh, rub here. Oh yes, rub right there. - Don't move. - Are you hurt? - Oh, give me some water. - Say something. - Give me some water. - Get him some water. Oh, that's it, it hurts right there. Oh no, right there, oh yeah. Oh, that feels good. Oh, right there, hurts right there. Oh, water. That's enough water. Enough water, oh yes, wipe. That's enough water. How are things going? Oh, just great. I'm starving, don't we get a lunch break around here? I'm sorry Mr. Edison, you'll have to wait until after lunch to discover electricity. Cindy's child labor law 4700. All finished at the concession stand? Oh, in spite of rain, sleet, snow, and Shirley's appetite, mission not quite accomplished, sir. - Trouble? - Is there anything else? Yes, lunch, this way Mr... Uh, Cindy, why don't you go ahead and eat with Shirley. Because I don't want to. Look, I'll join you both later. I've only got one more of these things to fix. No, why not let it wait until this afternoon? Because there's a worn-out lighting system that needs a lot of work. Maybe I could help. Putting you in the middle of 5,000 strands of wire would be like cutting my throat with a dull razor. All right, you win, but remember, all work and no play. Hey, it's Gary Lewis. - Hiya Gary. - Hey Rick, how are ya? Nice to see ya, like you to meet Cindy Foster. - Hi. - Hi. Mickey James, Shirley Boss, Gary Lewis. - Hiya Gary, how are ya? - Hi, Gary. What are you doing up here so early? Oh, I decided last night to check in a few days early, get some sun, relax. Swingin'. Say, can we use your bandstand for a while? Go right ahead. Beautiful, 'cause we got a tour coming up soon. I thought this would be a good chance to break in some new material. Hey, well be our guest. Say, I work better with an audience. Why don't you stick around? Oh, okay. Come on guys, let's go set up. You need any help? No, that's all right. # Come on baby # # Hey, ho # # Whoo # # Oh, oh, ho # # Yeah, ho, ho # # Come on baby # Gary, that was a great number! Listen, with you guys playing like that we can't lose. Thank you, may we continue? Sure, go ahead, and Gary, thanks for coming up here. You're welcome. Well we got some work to do. Let's go, we'll talk to you later. Wait a minute, Turk, wait. When you ask a girl for a date what happens? Before or after she picks me up? You know what I mean. Jeri puts me down something fierce. Says I'm a beast or animal. Any girl ever tell you that? Only on my good days. Hey, is that the chick you were talking about? Yeah, she never gets rid of her keeper. Hello, Cindy. How are things back at the factory? Closed for repairs to our tummies. Looks like a swim wouldn't hurt you either. Oh, is that a medical opinion? Biological. Hey, Shirley, I thought you ordered a tuna sandwich. Sure, for dessert. Rick, Mikey, you remember Turk. - Hello. - Oh yeah. You're that big lifeguard. Hey, can you swim? What was that? Bad joke, I was only kidding. Then do it somewhere else. That wasn't very nice of you, Mickey. All right, so what do you want me to do. Write it when I make bad jokes 500 times? Forget it, Mickey. Listen conference time, so far we have Gary Lewis and The Playboys as the house band. Got Donnie Brooks on Thursday, The Rip Chords on Friday, and The Righteous Brothers on Saturday. Cindy, can you and Shirley handle the concessions all right? I'm sure, why? I'm just trying to figure out how many people we'll have to hire. If you two can manage by yourselves with Mickey to take tickets and me backstage, then we'll just need a guy to sell tickets, at least the first night. Uh, well that's fine, but why not get a girl to sell tickets. Somehow I work better with girls. Dreamer. Pardon me big timers, while I go and soothe Romeo's fevered brow. Uh, I think my part of the list just walked by. Come on, Mickey, you can chase girls later. Well now who's chasing girls, Rick? I'm after the money, why that's three paying customers. 2 1/2 hours for lunch. 30 minutes later he takes off again. You're annoyed with Mickey aren't you? As a matter of fact yes. He's acting pretty irresponsible. Oh, what's so irresponsible about wanting to have some fun once in a while. Not everyone is cut out to be a Simon Legree. But you think I am? Oh, the way you're pushing and trying to do everything at once. Cindy, it's not smart business to wait until the last minute to do things. Besides an awful lot rides on this weekend. This project has to be a success or I've lost my next semester's tuition. My father offered you a job for this summer and you wouldn't take it. In fact, he offered you money to finish school on, didn't he? How'd you know that? I eavesdropped, besides if this doesn't work out and you're short on money, it's your own fault. For the last time, I appreciate what your father's tried to do, but I'm... Too stubborn to take advantage of it. Well what are you trying to prove? That I'm a mature, responsible human being, and able to stand on my own two feet. So be responsible when you're 80 years old and can't be anything else. That comment wasn't like you. How do you know what I'm like anymore? We never see enough of each other for that. All last semester you had your nose buried in books, work, work, work, and now this project. Knock it off, Cindy, you're acting stupid and childish. That's exactly what I am, a child, and I like it. Well I don't. Well then I'll find somebody who does. Now remember, the Miss Arrowhead Contest won't be announced until tomorrow, so don't tell anyone that I set up a preliminary meeting with the head judge. You can count on us, Mickey. We're with you, Mickey. Anything you say, Mickey. Yeah, well I mean, you know, we wouldn't want Rick to be accused of being partial, would we? No! Okay, well all up here, girls, come on. You're right there, that's it, line up. Um, oh Rick, you got a minute? I got a few contestants here I thought maybe you might wanna check out. Contestants? Uh, yeah, for the Miss Arrowhead Contest that we're presenting. What is this? A fix, I'm trying to line you up. It's cheering up time. Oh wait a minute, I'll give you some measurements. All right girls, just line right up there and I'll measure you. Mm, my, what a nice rib cage you got. Whoops, upside down, wait a minute. You must breathe a lot. Oh, my boyfriend's a weightlifter. Oh, well, that kills that, well inhale, yeah, oh boy. You're about to do some measuring mister? Uh, yes I was, but why don't you just tell me. 38! - Oh boy. - Okay, okay, - ...don't be so nervous. - Oh my foot! Oh, excuse me, didn't mean to. Oh let me, your pretty, covering up your pretty face. Hey, Rick, huh? How do you like that waistline? Uh, Monsieur Cassini, could you step over here for a minute, please? You wait right there girls. What's the matter, man. I'm trying to line you up. And I appreciate it, Mickey, but... No dice? No dice. Cindy really got to you huh? Yeah. Okay. All right girls, ten hut! Right face, right face! Forward march! Up, up, up, all, up, up, up, all, up, up. But Jeri, what's what so terrible about looking at a girl? Animal. Hey, Rick, you ever get the feeling that you're not alone? In restaurants, yes, eat. Oh, I knew it, I knew it, there she is again. Don't look, don't look. Everywhere I turn she's looking at me and taking notes. Notes, on what? On me! I'm telling you, it's weird. She's always looking at me. Okay, go ahead. - Now? - Yeah, go ahead. Wow, what's wrong with that, she's a gas. And then we can go moonlight swimming at my house. Oh, Rick, would you excuse me while I talk to my employer. Be my guest. Oh, Rick, at what time should I report for work tomorrow? We can handle things, everything is going fine. I wouldn't bet on it. Oh, Rick, don't be such a martyr, what time? Look, I told you, we don't need your help. All right, I'll just come in whenever I feel like it, which may not be too early. Well, how do you like it? I didn't know you were gonna paint this. Food inspires me. Cindy spent two hours on the patio last night. Really? She waited outside alone, just so I'd think she got in late. So. So don't bother being jealous. It's not good for your stomach, upsets the acid content, can't digest your food. That would be a tragedy, thanks Shirley. Hey you guys. Guess what I found, a topless bathing suit with a girl. - What? - How'd she look, man? Look at the front is as good as the back. - Time's a wasting. - Let's go. Look, I'll go over and start a conversation. You guys stay here and cool it. Yeah, look nonchalant like me. Excuse me, miss. The name is Gypsy Boots. Oh yeah, Mr. Boots, I thought you were an old friend, I mean... Don't panic, I look like a lot of old friends I guess. Here, have a banana, have some grapes, have a pepper. Here have a peach, have a ball, have a Gypsy Boots Energy Wafer. Have a cucumber, have a Gypsy Boots Energy Wafer. Have some grapes, have a ball, have a life! Briefly this is it, you suffer from a basic insecurity which manifests itself through periodic delusions of grandeur, combined with narcissistic tendencies which you tend to sublimate. Really? Yes, you're repressing a great deal. Why it's obvious in your fantasies and erroneously carried-out actions, why? Oh, I'm just lucky I guess. Now that's no way to look at your problems. How am I going to help you if you don't cooperate. Help me what? Find yourself, become a well-adjusted, normal human being. Why don't you call me and we'll talk about it, all right. We're going to talk about it now. After all, I love you, and I... You what? Well I don't really love you, it's just that I decided that every girl needs to have at least one summer romance, and you're mine. Well why me? Because I have faith in you. Somewhere under that rough, clumsy exterior you have a mind. - Yeah. - Not that I want to quench the hidden fires that I feel raging within you, but I do think that a meeting of the minds is definitely necessary before there can be any perfect blending of two diametrically-opposed personalities such as ours. Now Havelock Ellis says... Look, excuse me, I don't know Havelock Ellis, and I gotta go, okay? Some kind of nut! So Shirley said that Cindy's trying to make you jealous, huh? Maybe the whole thing's more my fault than I care to admit. I should call her. Hi, you want to go the opening of the new Lake Area Country Club with us? Turk says it's fabulous. No thanks. Oh, I forgot, you probably have some work to do. Nothing like work for building character. That looks like you just saved yourself a dime, Rick. What do these look like to you? The Battle of the Bulge. Well, what did you expect, the whole Second World War? You're Rick Howell, aren't you? Yes, and you're? Alone, all alone. And so are you it seems. I like to read. And I like to have someone read to me. Mind if I join you? Not if you don't mind sharing a small beach towel. Is there any other kind? Okay, Mickey, turn them on. That's good, turn them off. Well everything seems to check out. Nothing to do now until the band arrives except take it easy. Yeah, I gotta get going, I have an appointment. To do what? Take it easy. Oh yeah, with who? Sandra. Oh, Miss Mechanical Arts of Arrowhead Beach, huh. That's an awful good chick. Wait'll Cindy sees you with her. I have a feeling that she'll throw in the towel, Turkish that is. Oh, Mickey, your jokes lately. Is it my fault you don't have a sense of humor? Mickey, that's a distinct rationalization on your part. Oh here she is again. Just because Rick has a different frame of reference to the psychic world than you do, it doesn't necessarily mean that he's lacking in human. Now Freud devoted several chapters to an examination of the subject of will, and, oh excuse me, I should have introduced myself. I'm Jeri Mason. Oh, Rick Howell. Oh dear, I wonder what that means. Oh boy. Because everything we say and do has a definite meaning, you know. Yeah, yeah, like a goodbye for instance. Oh, but you can't go yet. Why I haven't even begun to explain your personality. I mean if we're going to be lovers I think it's only fair... Would you please stop saying that. Why, does the thought of being loved frighten you? I'm not frightened, I'm panicked. But that's absurd. Of course, there are things in your childhood that I don't know about. Yeah, I was the fastest kid on the block. Oh, Shirley. Come on, Sandra, we don't belong here. I do, I like parties. Don't let me keep you away. Turk, don't make waves. What have I done? Oh nothing so far, let's keep it that way. So what happened to the music? Just waiting for your friend to arrive. Why, I'm here. Well, call you conspicuous. Oh, excuse me while I play hostess. Rick! Where are you going? Back to town. Well why don't you stay for the party? Look, Cindy, haven't you done enough already? She certainly has, and come to think of it maybe it's about time you thanked her for it. Thanked her for what? For letting you play big man on her father's money. Turk, shut up! What are you talking about? Where your money came from. I was with Johnson that first day, remember, huh, remember? Cindy put on quite an act after you left. Said her father would put up the money. She told Johnson not to say anything, huh? Yeah, might put a dent in Rick baby's ego. Rick, wait! I didn't mean for you to find out this way. But I did, now just leave me alone. No, no, no, no, no, I think it's the other way around. You leave her alone. Look, if you want to play hero, go find yourself a windmill. Not while I have you available. All right big timer, you and me. Proud of yourself? I might ask you the same thing. You're as much to blame for this as I am. Rick, I'm sorry. Hey, hey. Hey. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I'm Gary Lewis and on behalf of the Playboys and myself, we'd like to welcome you here to the Dance Pavilion up at Lake Arrowhead. To really kick off this swingin' summer, we'd like to bring to you one of the finest entertainers in the world, from Reprise Records, we bring to you Mr. Personality himself, Donnie Brooks. Hi gang. Hi, Donnie! I wanna tell you about a woman. I wanna tell you about a woman that's crazy. # I call her Penny the Poo # # She knows exactly what to do # # She's a real cool darling # # She's a hot tamale # # Yeah she's so cool # # I call her Penny the Poo # # Oh Penny the Poo # # She's a good looker too # # She's a real cool honey # # She's a red hot bunny # # Yeah she's so cool # # I call her Penny the Poo # # Well she can twist and shout # # She can shake it all about # # She can do the dog # # She hop like a bug # # Pretty good at mashed potato # # Well she's nice too # # She can so do the bird and the watusi too # # Oh Penny the Poo # # She knows exactly what to do # # She's a real go-getter # # She's my babysitter # # Yeah she's so cool # # I call her Penny the Poo # # Yeah she's so cool # # I call her Penny the Poo # # Whoa yeah # Oh boy it looks like we got it made. At least for this weekend. Boy, if we can just keep it up for the whole summer. Eh, don't sweat it, Rick. Hey, Cindy, why don't you take a break, I can handle things. Rick, just wanted to congratulate you on the success of the dance. Thanks. Rick Howell! For a guy who always says he likes to play fair, you don't give me much of a chance. I want to apologize for the way I acted. All I ever meant to do was to help. Somehow everything got twisted around. That first day at Mr. Johnson's, well, you needed money. - My father has plenty. - So you talked him into giving some to your needy boyfriend... Oh, it was not a gift, he loaned it. 12% percent interest, I started it. 12%, that's illegal. I know it, but I thought you'd feel better if he were taking advantage of you instead of you're taking advantage of him. Well I've got news for him, he'll get six and not a penny more. Anything you say Mr. Howell. Hi, what's new? Dermal optical perception. Mm, sounds wild. I say we try it tonight. And I know just the place, moonlight, music, badness. Mush. Don't hand me the jazz. I saw you with Mickey last night. The way you were looking at him you could have smothered him to death. I'm ready to die. Sorry, but mercy killing isn't legal. What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing to you. - You know, Jeri, you treat me like I've got some kind of disease or something. You have, lockjaw of the brain. Come on, everybody into the lake. Come on, get up there. Oh, just for one ski race. Hey, Mickey! What about a chicken run? Yeah sure, you got any chickens? I think I've got one, you. What do you mean? I think you're afraid to play chicken, on skis. What are you talking about? A little poultry contest. Instead of using cars we use skis with boats flat out. Knock it off Tony, those crazy contests were outlawed years ago. We know you have guts. I want to find out if Mr. Chicken has any. I think the whole thing is ridiculous and dangerous. But if it's not dangerous how are we gonna prove who's the better man? What's the difference? Tony, I will not allow you to goad Mickey into this ridiculous race. Mickey, it would be beneath you to indulge in such a crude display of animalistic tendencies. Now you have a mind, you don't need to compete physically. Haven't you even got nerve enough to admit that you're chicken? Gonna let her do it for you? I can take care of myself. Then prove it. Look, I don't even know how this contest works. Don't try to chicken out, I'll show you, when we're on skis. Tony, why don't you take off and leave Mickey alone? Why is everyone trying to protect me all of a sudden? Because you're asking for trouble if you get into this race! Look, I'm a pretty good skier! How good are you at getting knocked into the water with boats flat out? Who says it's gonna be me, Rick? It will. The point is somebody's gonna get hurt, and could be killed. Sounds like they're trying to scare you, Mickey. Get the boats ready. What happens now? You'll see. Hit it! Now we split and head straight for each other. Come on! Is he okay? I don't know, get him in the boat. Boy, I thought you were a goner. Thanks man. Your name better be Turk. - It is. - Good. Then you buy us another round. Look, I'm in a hurry. You guys wanna earn some money or not? Look kid, you called me, I didn't call you. Now what's the deal? There'll be a dance at the pavilion tonight. I want you to go in there and break it up. It'll be 20 bucks to each of you. Double it. Oh, it's worth it. There'll be two guys at the gate. One answers to the name of Mickey, forget him. But the other, Rick Howell, he's the one. You won't have any trouble. Sounds easy enough. One more thing kid, you'd better be on the level. Ladies and gentlemen, the Lake Arrowhead Pavilion is proud to present to you a group known worldwide for their surfing and hot rod records. Columbia's recording artist, The Rip Chords. # I got a red hot Roadster that really goes # # I won a lot of cups at the hot rod show # # The big Chrysler really makes her nothing but fast # # I'm hell on them drags man I'm never outclassed # # You'll never shut her so don't even try # # Just give me some room and let me go by # # In my Roadster # # My red hot Roadster # # I'm running whitewall slicks and big mag wheels # # I'm coming off the line you know she really peels # # I really turn her on when the flag is dropped # # She still wants to go when my shoot is popped # # You'll never shut her so don't even try # # Just give me some room and let me go by # # In my Roadster # # My red hot Roadster # # Even on the street you know she runs out fine # # Nine more payments and she'll be mine # # She's the best in town though I hate to brag # # I wouldn't trade her in on a brand new Jag # # You'll never shut her so don't even try # # Just give me some room and let me go by # # In my Roadster # # My red hot Roadster # # My red hot Roadster # - Thank you. - Thank you. Well, I guess that wraps it up for tonight. Yeah, you know, it looks like the best night so far, Rick baby. How's business Rick baby? Couldn't be better, sir. Good, let's have three tickets. I'm sorry, these dances are for teenagers only. No adults are admitted. I'm a teenager, how about you boys? - Yeah. - We're just sweet 16. Uh, now look fellas, we don't want any trouble. We'd appreciate if you'd leave now. Look kid, do you want the money or do we go in free? Hey, knock it off, knock it off, we'll leave. Rick, you want me to call the cops? No, keep it private. Tell the band to keep playing. We came to have fun, let's have some. Gary, hit it! Rick, are you all right. I am now if these guys are out of here. Oop, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh, hey! Come on, baby!
