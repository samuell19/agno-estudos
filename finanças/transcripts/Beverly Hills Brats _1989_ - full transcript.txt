You know, it happened around that last curve, so it's your fault, creep. You owe me 30 bucks. - I finally get a chance to turn out a Corvette and you're worried about a stupid fingernail? - I would have beaten you. - Oh, come on. A Corvette can beat a Toyota any day. - I'm not gonna argue, Sterling. Get my books. - Get them yourself. - Get real. - Well, have Scooter get them. Where is he anyway? - He was with you. (engine revs) (dramatic music) - I think we're lost. - That's great. Ask that kid over there. Maybe he knows where we're at. - Okay. (tires screech) - What the heck? - What are you doing hitchhiking, young man? I'd never forgive myself if I left you here alone and then saw your face on my milk carton. Get in. (door closes) - Here, uh, why don't you buy yourself a car seat. - Why, I can't take this from you. - It's okay, I'll just get some more tomorrow. It's my lunch money. (orchestral music) - How am I doing? - This card and draw again. - No fair getting professional help, Lillian. - When we play at your house, Gertie, your couple could help you. - If you don't quit changing the rules, I'll never learn to play this game. - I might as well give up. I still have Hispanic help. - My cousin, Han Louis, cousin Louie and his family come from old country very soon. I'll make arrangement for you to have good help, okay? - Oh, thank you, Hee, thank you. - Okay. - You'll love them darling and the nice part is they don't expect you to learn their language. - Hi, Grandma. - Oh, hi darling, kiss, kiss. Isn't he a fine boy? (upbeat rock music) - [Computer] Good morning, Scooter, please enter code. All systems activated. - Read the first five chapters of "Kidnapped" by Robert Lewis Stevens. (engine idles) - Hello! - Hi, Dad. Bye, Dad. - Not so fast, young man. Where do you think you're going? - I've got a meeting. - Oh, no you don't. You know very well this family has supper together every Monday night. - That's only because Matteo's just closed. - That's not true. These suppers are very important to me and your stepmother. - Aw, come on, Dad. She's not even home yet. - She will be, now don't hassle me about this, Sterling. I've already had a rough day. - That's not my fault. - What is it? Nobody around here appreciates how difficult it is being a plastic surgeon. It's not all breasts and backsides, you know. You cancel your appointment and get dressed for dinner. - [TV Announcer] They're approaching the eighth hole. It's Terry's October and Jason G. Terry's October and Jason G. Jason G, a neck in front. It's Jason G. - I can't believe it, I can't believe it. - We lost, Elmo. - We lost, Clive? - You wanna open up your ears, Elmo, we lost. So you wanna tell us what happened, mister big shot mathematician? You wanna tell us what happened? - It's hard to believe it, but I must have mad ea mistake with the calculus. - What calculus? - Calculus. - Stop crying, will you? I'll get your money back if it's the last thing I do. - Can we, uh, bet again tomorrow? Well, I have nothing to do. - Well, I finished gambling. I'm not standing around getting pushed by you guys. That's the last time I'm gonna chart anything for you. - So how are we supposed to get our money back, huh, mister big shot? - That's easy. I'll go back to work. - Oh, man, what about your low blood sugar. - You win some, you lose some, right Lepke? - Hey, don't tell me, Clive. I lost some of my rent for the year. - This is painful, Clive. I don't even have enough to get drunk. (horn blows) (whimsical music) - Oh, Roberto, wasn't the exhibit exquisite? I had no idea how intricate art is, but then when you explained to me how the total composition offsets the emotional thrusts, rendered through textural nuances, spatial relations, I was totally speechless. You've opened up my eyes to a whole new world. - I'm an artist. - And what an artist. I was so lucky to discover you sketching tourists right in the lobby in the Rio Hilton. Bringing you to Beverly Hills was the best idea I ever had, now that all my friends are just green with envy that I have you living right here in my guest house. - Oh, no, that's my pleasure, my little palomita. - Palomita. Oh, I just love your accent. Uh-oh, hurry up and get dressed for dinner. We're already late and we don't wanna upset Jeffrey, do we? - Oh, no, no, of course not. He pays the bills. - See, Jerry. Other husbands, they have valet parking for their wives, but not you. Oh, no, no, not you. You make me go all the way around the world for my car. Jerry, for God sake, I don't understand why you make me park all the way in God's country when they simply employ people to park the car and bring it back. - Terry, Terry, Terry, I told you a million times and I'm gonna say it to you again. I'm not gonna tip a stranger that's going to grind my clutch and scratch my CDs. Look, I know what I'm doing. Will you trust me? Let's go this way. Now watch your head. - Don't make a sound. - Or we blow your brains out. - Oh, my God, Jerry. We are being robbed. - Come on, come on, we don't have all night. - No. - What? - What? - What? - You heard what I said. I'm not gonna give you my valuables. I'm not kidding, your old lady gets it if you don't cooperate. - Now give me your wallet. - Wallet? That won't do you any good. I don't have any cash. And the credit cards, in half an hour, I can have it canceled. - Give me that gold watch then. - Hey, gold watch, no, no. - Jerry give him the gold watch for God sakes. He's gonna kill me. - She's gonna get it. - Well, go ahead. My wife is insured. Oh, boy, is she insured. My watch isn't. - I don't believe it. - I don't believe this. Are you crazy? Jerry, this is no time for negotiating deals. - Terry, read my lips, no. - These people are nuts. Let's get outta here. - There. - Are you crazy? - You know. - I can't believe it, that guy had a gun to my head and you were gonna let him shoot me. - I had a hunch the guys didn't have the guts to pull that trigger. - I don't like this town. It's got bad vibes. Why don't we go back to Kansas? - Beverly Hills is the richest city in the world. - Yeah, but these people are weird. They don't even know a good heist when they see one. - I didn't travel across this country not to get mine, you understand that? - Yeah. - So you with me or what? - I'm with you. - Good. (upbeat music) - Hey, uh, we're closing man. - Nah, I'm just gonna get one thing. (upbeat music) - Hey, they guy said the place is closed, beat it. - Is this stuff together? - Yeah. Hey, you have change of 50? - I said we're closing, okay? - Give us the money. Hey, I don't want any problems, okay. - No problems. - Ah! (groceries crash) (upbeat music) - How much? - 300. - Not bad. - Peanuts. - Yeah, peanuts. Not big time, is it? - Nope. - Let me hold it. - Give me a drink. (gentle music) - Ah, Lillian, you look absolutely stunning tonight, as always. - No wonder you're my favorite son-in-law. - How many others were there? - Oh, I'm very bad at arithmetic. - Would you like a drink? - No, thanks. I want to talk to you. You know I've never been an interfering mother-in-law. But I want to talk about Roberto. - Go on. - Don't you think his time is up? After all, he's painted everybody in the family. - But he hasn't painted you yet. - No, and he's not going to. - Now, be a sport. Somebody has to capture your exquisite beauty. - You're so full of charm. - I don't understand why we have to wear these things just to eat. - If they can dress for dinner on Dallas, we can dress for Dallas in Beverly Hills. - Great, the Ewings? What a family to have as a role model. - What did you say, dear? - I said I love having a good family as a role model, Grandma Lil. - See, Jeffrey. I told you these family dinners would bring us closer. Jeffrey, can't you take your mind off work even for a minute? - I'm terribly sorry, darling. Yes, these family dinners are wonderful. Sterling, why don't you do the blessing? - The what? - The blessing, bless the food. - Why? What's wrong with it? - Just say the grace, Sterling. It's the proper thing to do. Let us all bow our heads. - Dear God, we thank you fondly for this Moroccan food we're about to receive. Make us truly grateful for all the blessings that we so enjoy and God bless Grandma, Dad and Veronica, Roberto and Scooter and Tiffany, amen. - Amen. Well done, Sterling. - Dr. Miller, you have a patient, Ms. Lambert on line one. - Excuse me. Ms. Tiffany, Manny on line two and line three, Master Sterling, man don't wanna give name. - I'm terribly sorry everyone. I have an emergency house call. Will you forgive me, Veronica? - I knew I'd have to make sacrifices when I married a doctor. Go ahead, darling. - I won't be late. - I have to go see Manny- - I got to take a meeting. - It's an emergency. - Okay. - Want some rice, Grandma? - No, thanks Scooter, it gives me gas. - [Hee] Your dog, Sophie, he's eating Senor Roberto's paint again. - Oh, no. - [Lillian] Dear. I wonder what color it is this time? - This is it. It's like picking strawberries. - What am I looking for? - Stereos. - Like radios? - Yeah. - Zippo. Ditto. - Zippo, it looks like somebody's already hit this neighborhood. - One more. Bingo. (alarm blares) (tires squeal) - Geez, what the hell was that noise? - A burglar alarm. You been in the joint too long. - They're putting them in cars now? - Times have changed. - We meet tomorrow night at 11:30 at Roxbury Park. At midnight, we rendezvous with my colleague, Domingo, from East LA. Then we pick up the goods- - [Scooter] Can I come, too. - Damn you, Scooter. I told you never to sneak up on me. Now go on, I'm in a meeting. - You and Tiffany forgot to take me home from school yesterday. - So what'd you do, sleep at school? - Listen, mister big shot, you'll forget me and I'll get kidnapped. 50,000 children disappear every year and only 2% are ever found. If that happens to me, it'll be all your fault. Mom and Dad will be real mad. Then you'll be sorry. Don't count on it, kid. I'm not that lucky. Scooter, you're in high school now. You've gotta grow up and quit tagging after me. - Well, it could happen, you know. - Lay that guilt trip on Tiffany. I'm busy. - Thanks a lot. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. - I'll take one. And a package of Twinkies. And the same for the girl over there, please. - All right, that'll be 10 bucks, Scooter. - Can you break a hundred? - No sweat. There you go. Thanks. Excuse me, girls. A gift from Scooter. - Hi. - Oh, hi. - I saw you in English. My name's Tulip Randall. - I'm Montgomery Miller, but my friends call me Scooter. - I was impressed that you finished your book report so fast. May I join you? - Sure. - Thanks for the sandwich. (gentle music) - Well, my parents were married to other people when they met and my dad had already had Sterling and my dad mom had already had Tiffany and then they fell madly in love with each other and had me. - Wow, that's romantic. - Yeah, but they don't care about each other anymore. - Why not? - They got married. - That'll do it. (upbeat music) - Anyway, your maid will get worried if you're home late. - Okay, but call me tonight, okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. (door closes) (upbeat music) - Sterling. - [Jeffrey] Hello, this is Dr. Miller. I'm sorry I'm not in right now, but if you'll leave your name and number, I'll be happy to return your call a soon as possible. - Dad, this is Scooter. Tiff and Sterling left me at school again today, so I'm gonna have to try to find a way home. Lots of my friends' dads pick them up from school and I was thinking it would be kind of neat if you could pick me up one day and maybe we could out or, I don't know. I'll see you when I get home, Dad. I love you. (phone beeps) (somber music) - [Veronica] Oh, Roberto, hurry up. I can't stand the suspense, go ahead, do it. - It'll be my pleasure. Ta-da. - Oh. Roberto, it's beautiful. - I know. - Jeffrey will love it. And when that's finished, you can start on one of my Bentleys. (phone rings) - Is somebody gonna answer the phone? I hate unionized servants. - Dr. Miller here. - Do you think you might come over and adjust them again for me tonight? - Oh, I'm sure I can. You know breasts have to be watched constantly to prevent infection. - You sure it's not too much trouble? - No, of course not. I'll just have to rearrange my schedule this evening. I'm a busy man, you know. - I know. Hurry. - Hurrying. (phone slams) - Hello, Veronica. - Hello, Jeffrey. - Listen, darling, since it's the servants' night off, I made an appointment to see a patient. I hope you don't mind. - Oh, that's all right, darling. I have to attend a dinner party with Roberto. - Hmm, well, have a nice time, darling. - You, too, darling (smooches). - Tulip, hi, this is Scooter. What are you doing? - Trying to figure out this math problem. Our accountant usually does my homework, but she's out of town on business. - Oh, math's a snap. I could come on over and help, but both my parents are gone and it's the servants' night off. So I don't have a ride. - You mean you're home all alone? That's neat. I've never been alone in my life. - Now that's neat. (dramatic music) - [Computer] There's an intruder in the living room. Intruder in the living room. - Tulip, can I call you back? I'm gonna go check something out with my equipment. - It's okay, I have to finish my homework anyway. I'll see you at school tomorrow, bye. - Bye. - [Computer] Intruder in the living room. Intruder in the living room. Intruder in the living room. - This is a 15-shot automatic pistol and I'm an expert shot. I'm a member of the Beverly Gun Club. - All right, kid. Can I keep, never mind. (dramatic music) Look. Oh. Sorry, kid. Nothing's missing. I can go home now and we can make believe I never was here. - [Scooter] You're not going anywhere. Are you okay, mister? - I'm fine, kid. This is my normal reaction when my life is threatened by a gun. (Clive blowing nose) - You're shaking. - Well, I got this condition, kid. When I'm nervous, this is what happens. I need something sweet. You got any candy? - Will a Nestle do? - Yes, the sugar will calm me down. - You're not very good at this. Have you ever tried some other line of work? - I'll check the want ads tomorrow morning. - Who are you? - My name's Clive Belnap. Listen kid, up to now I haven't done any serious time and I'd rather not start, okay? Can we call this thing a draw and I'll be gone? - You have a family? - No, no ladies. The excitement could be life threatening. - Do you wanna make some really easy money? - What do you think I'm doing here? - I want you to kidnap me and get the ransom. - Are you in therapy or something? - Look, it's fool proof. You and I will hide out for a few days. My dad'll give you $500,000. I'm safe and you're rich. - Nobody has 500,000 to hand out, kid. - My dad does. - How do I know that? - We live in Beverly Hills, don't we? - I sure could use the money. But if I get the 500 grand, what do you get? - I get enough, is it a deal? - No. Thank you just the same. You're probably gonna get burglarized again soon, so just ask the next guy. - If you walk outta here, I'll push this button. The entire Beverly Hills police force will arrive before you each the end of the driveway. I'll tell them that you threatened me with this gun. - Sure. Sure. I bet you pull wings off of flies, too, don't you? - I just need to get a few things before we go. - Things like what? - [Scooter] Things like money. - I can't believe you got me to haul all your computer crap in my car. Who's getting kidnapped here anyway? - I am. Isn't it exciting? - Thrilling. You said something about getting the money. What kind of bread did you get to finance this endeavor? - How does 15 grand sound? - Where'd you get that kind of money, kid? - It's my dad's hotel money. He doesn't like to use his credit cards for illicit trysts. - Illicit trysts? - Yep, he hides it in his sock, but I always knew which drawer. - Wow, you really are a brat, huh. - Hey, Clive, this is just the beginning. (siren blares) - I knew this was a mistake. Hide the money kid, hide the money. - Pull over. I'll take care of it. (doors close) What's the problem, officer? My friend has violated no traffic regulations. - Get back in the car, kid. - What's the charge? - Get back in the car, son. - The only crime my friend is committed is driving an old beat up car through Beverly Hills. That is why you stopped him, isn't it? - Look, the vehicle looks suspicious with the computer equipment in the back seat. I got a probable cause. - My name is engraved on every piece. I happen to know my rights. Just because my friend's care is a little bit older than the normal- - I'm warning you, son. Get back in the car. - You are clearly harassing me. My father is the president of MRP Studios and if I tell him about this unwarranted search of an underprivileged, out of work citizen, who is just trying to brighten his otherwise drab existence by gazing at people's homes more fortunate than he, my father will launch a full investigation of the brutality of the Beverly Hills Police Force, make a mini-series out of it and air it during sweeps week. Now, if you gentlemen will be so kind as to give me your names and badge numbers, I'm sure that the screenwriter would like to spell them correctly. L. - Okay, hey, okay. We're just doing our jobs. You can go. - We have to lose this car. Why don't you turn around. - Excuse me, officer, is this Beverly Hills?

It's been a long time since I had a suite of my own. - All right, sweet dreams. - We're gonna get along just fine, kid. This is gonna be a fun trip. - Just like I said, it's fool proof. - By the way, what's your name? - My friends call me Scooter. - See you in the morning, Scooter. - Goodnight, Clive. - Excuse me, lady. I think you got the wrong room. - There's nothing in the papers yet. We'll have to wait for the afternoon editions. - Scooter? - Of course, who did you expect? - Great disguise, huh? - You look like Little Bo Peep. - Well, I'm better. My dad paid a thousand bucks for this costume. I won first prize last Halloween. - You're not a little funny, are you kid? - I'm incognito. I don't wanna get recognized by the hotel staff. - Oh. - Any minute, there should be a news bulletin about my disappearance and we don't want anybody to turn me in before we collect the ransom. - You think it's really gonna work, huh? - Of course, it's fool proof. - Fool proof? You got a lot to learn about life, kid. - Skeptic. - Hey, it's your kidnapping. Me, I'm starving. I'm gonna go out and get me some breakfast. What kind of donuts would you like? - I ordered some room service. - You got this for us? - For you, I already ate. - Thank you, kid. - You think this is something, just wait until you get your money. I have the entire house wired to this monitor. Every phone call and every activity is filtered right through here. I don't have the video set up because I couldn't bring the satellite dish. But we'll still be able to know what leads the police have and we'll make sure they don't arrest you before we can get the money. - Arrest me? I thought you said this is fool proof? - That's why I have the house bugged. - I can't believe it. Dinner was better than lunch, and lunch was greater than breakfast. It's like heaven. I should kidnap people more often. - I don't get it. There should be some word by now. I called Tulip. She's my girlfriend. - Whoo. - Well, anyway, I called her so she wouldn't worry, but she said she hadn't heard that I was missing. - Oh, maybe your parents are afraid to publicize it until they get a ransom call. - You're right. Okay, sound real mean. (phone rings) - Miller residence. - Dr. Miller, please. - Just one moment. - Dr. Miller, phone for you. - All right. - Dr. Miller here. - We have Scooter. - Hold on a minute. - Oh, wait a minute. - He wants to talk to Scooter. - Sorry, Master Montgomery not available. You leave message. - No, I wanna talk to Dr. Miller. - Okay. - Dr. Miller, he want talk to you again. - Goddamn it, can't a man take a haircut in peace in his own home What is it? - [Scooter] We have Scooter. Listen carefully and the kid won't get hurt. - What are you talking about? Who is this? - We've kidnapped your son, Dr. Miller, and if we don't get 500,000 on noon on Saturday, I'll, I'll, what'll I do? - If we don't get the dough by Saturday, we'll ice the kid, murder him, capisce? - Look, I don't know what you're talking about. Scooter's in his room. If you wanna talk to him, call him on his own private line and stop bothering me. Hee, get Scooter down here, will you? - Yes, sir. - They don't even know I'm gone. I could be dead for all they care. - Scooter, it's not like it sounds. - Yes, it is. I've been gone for 24 hours and they don't even know I'm gone. (gentle piano music) - Sorry, can't find Scooter anywhere. - Really? - [Hee] Yes, sir. - My God, maybe this kidnapping is for real. Hee, get all the members of the family together immediately. - Yes, Doctor. (phone rings) (upbeat jazz music) - Mr. Earl speaking. Yes. They are. Yes. I'll tell them. - There's been an emergency at your house, Mr. Miller. - Emergency? Oh, my gosh. Come on, Mother, excuse me. Come on, Roberto. (upbeat jazz music) - Miss Tiffany, telephone. - [Hee] Miss Tiffany, father wants return home. - Do I have to? - [Hee] Yes, he say very important. - Okay, tell him I'll be home in a couple of minutes. - [Hee] Okay. - I have to go, Manny. Jeffrey's getting paternal again. God, I hate it when he does that. - [Scooter] Tiff and Sterling left me at school again today so I'm gonna have to try to find a way home. Lots of my friends' dads pick them up from school and I was thinking it'd be kind of neat if you could pick me up one day and maybe we could go out or, I don't know, I love you. (phone beeps) - Dammit, Veronica. If you'd been home instead of shopping all day, this wouldn't have happened. Don't you blame this on me. If you'd spend some time with your family instead of your patients, you'd know when your son is missing. - My patients pay the bills around here. - You would all be spending a lot more if you weren't living in the house my darling husband left me, God rest his soul. - Tiffany, you and Sterling are supposed to be taking Scooter to and from school. Why did you abandon him today? - Hey, I'm doing important social work at school. Do you realize what am imposition a little brother is? Haven't you two ever heard of birth control? - What? - Don't you talk to us like that you little brat. - If I'm a brat, who made me that way? - How can talk to your mother that way? - Please, don't do this to yourselves. We must comfort each other in this time of terrible tragedy. - [Together] Shut up. - Where the heck is Sterling? (upbeat music) (siren blares) - Gig's up. Okay, I give up. I got all the names of my contacts. I got everything written down. (officers chattering) - Scooter, Scooter, Scooter. - Here, Doctor. - Thank you, Lieutenant Goldpark. - Goldfield. - I'm sorry, Goldfield. - Look, we'll need a photograph of the boy to circulate to the newspapers. - Yes, of course, get the picture. - [Sterling] Hello? - Well, it's about time, Sterling. - Sterling, get over here. - [Sterling] Dad, what's going on? - What's going on? Scooter's been kidnapped, that's what's going on. And it's all your fault. - Got kidnapped? - Yes, kidnapped. - I think he had a premonition about this. He knew this was gonna happen. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, were there any kind of threats? - I don't know. He just said he was in danger of being kidnapped and that I'd be really sorry. I only wish I'd pay more attention. - Yes, Sterling, you should have paid more attention. It's all your fault. - Calm down, calm down. We'll get the perpetrators, all right. Is this Montgomery? - No, that's a painting of him. - Do you have anything smaller? (Jeffrey cries) - The cops are everywhere and they've got the phones tapped and they're even fingerprinting. We got 'em, Clive, we got 'em. - Oh, that's great, kid. - In Los Angeles, 15-year-old Montgomery Miller, son of prominent plastic surgeon, Dr. Jeffrey Miller, and his socialite wife, Veronica, was kidnapped from his home yesterday. We now take you live to Beverly Hills for a talk with young Montgomery's grieving family. Are you there, Dr. Miller? - Yes, Janet, we're here. - [Janet] Thank you for getting up so early to join us live here on the East Coast. - It's all right, we're early risers. - [Janet] Dr. Miller, have you heard anything from the kidnappers of your son? - Yes, Janet, we have. They called last night about 6 o'clock and said that they had kidnapped Scooter. That's what we call him, Scooter. (Veronica cries) Please, please, try to control yourself. We're on national television. - [Janet] Doctor, that is quite all right. You know, I have three children of my own. I don't think I'd be holding up as well if something happened to one of them. - Well, that's why we decided to talk to you, Janet, instead of Bryant Gumbel. - Thank you. - [Jeffrey] You're welcome. - Dr. Miller, has there been a ransom demand? - [Jeffrey] Yes, Janet, the kidnappers are demanding $500,000, that's half a mil, and they said to have it ready by Saturday at noon. That's in two days from now, you know. - Now I understand your son had been threatened before he was actually kidnapped. - Yes, Janet. - Yeah, yeah, I think that's all my fault. He told me it might happen and I didn't believe him. I didn't think, it's my fault. - Stop, you're making a fool of yourself. - I knew he'd be sorry. - [Janet] Have you heard anything else from the kidnappers, Doctor? - [Jeffrey] No, Janet, we have not, but we're hoping that they're watching the show right now and if they are, we want them to know that there are no hard feelings and that we are willing and anxious to cooperate and that we don't really care about the money. We just want our son back. - [Janet] One last question and then I'll let you go. Do you believe your son is still alive? - Well, they're not gonna get the money if he's not. We haven't talked to Scooter, but we're praying that he's safe. - [Janet] And we're praying with you, Doctor. - Thank you, Janet, we're praying for you, too. - A 50,000 reward has been posted by Lillian Marvin. That's the boy's maternal grandmother and if any of our viewers have information concerning the whereabouts of Montgomery "Scooter" Miller, please contact the Beverly Hills Police Department. - They miss me, Clive, they miss me. - Oh. They're really worried. Did you see the way your mother looks? Scooter, we can't go through with this. I gotta take you back. - No way, Clive. We're still going through with the plan. You still want your money, don't you? - Not if it breaks a mother's heart, kid. - Clive, don't you see what's going on? They finally noticed me and if they don't believe that I was really in danger, then they'll just take me for granted again when I go home. - Wait a minute, you set up this stunt just to get your family to notice you? - I just wanted somebody to pay attention to me. - You know, I figured when you had money, everything would be okay. I guess it ain't always the case, is it? - Money can't buy you love, Clive. - But you see how much they love you now. - Well, it took them long enough. - [Janet] Dr. Miller, has there been a ransom demand? - [Jeffrey] The kidnappers are demanding $500,000. That's half a mil. - What did I say? - You said it. - I said what? - We should have picked up that kid when we had the chance. - You know what gets me, you know what really gets me off, is our luck. - It's this town. We gotta get outta here. - It's our luck. (phone rings) - Hello? It's for Sterling, Sterling? - Hello? - [Man] Hey, Sterling, where you been? My boys are waiting for you. We got TVs, VCRs. - This line is for emergency use only. My little brother has been kidnapped and all the lines are tapped by the FBI. - [Man] I'm outta here, man. - If you have any information about (phone buzzes) Hello? Wrong number. - Grandma Lil has offered $50,000. Mom will make Dad add 100. Now it's at $150,000. - Oh. - Unfortunately, the police are doing a much better job than I gave them credit for. They have the phones rigged with high speed tracing devices and they'll know the location of the call before you even say hello. And the drop sight will be surrounded, as well. I'm sorry, Clive, but I don't think you're gonna get your money. But I've got a new plan. - How come I don't feel any better? - Just listen. When I feel that the pot is as high as it's gonna get, we'll show our cards. - Give that to me in English, okay, Scooter. - When I feel that the reward money is as high as it's gonna get, I'll go home, tell him I escaped from the kidnappers and that you helped save me. Then you'll get your money and everyone will be happy. - Well, that sounds fair. - Of course. It's fool- - No, don't say the word. - When are they gonna call, Veronica? - I guess when they're ready to negotiate. Oh, Jeffrey, if anything happens to Scooter, I'll die. I'll just die. - Hush, baby, don't think about it. - Jeffrey, where did we go wrong? - It doesn't matter. Everything's gonna be different from now on, you'll see. - Hey, Dad, can I talk to you for a minute? - Not now, son. Wait a second, Sterling. Listen, I'm sorry I yelled at you before. Not paying enough attention to my family is how we lost Scooter and it wasn't your fault. What's on your mind? - It can wait. Veronica needs you now. - You sure? - Yeah. - Well, you know, I'm always here for you, Sterling. - Me, too, Sterling. - To Sterling. - To Sterling. - Okay, I'll see you. - That kid, I'll bet, will make a great veterinarian. - He's a fine boy, fine boy. (whimsical music) - You know I'm famous for winning. You won't put me in jail if I cheat, will you? (doorbell rings) - Hello, I am Machmud Kalid, a friend of Tiffany's. May I speak to her, please? - You come in. I'll get Miss Tiffany. - Thank you very much. - Mom, Grandma, Jeffrey, Sterling, I want you to meet my boyfriend, Manny. - This is Manny? - Yes. We're just tired of sneaking around behind your backs. - I didn't know you were sneaking around behind our backs. Did you know she was sneaking around behind our backs, Veronica? - No, I didn't know. - I knew it. - You did? - Tiffy, we thought that Manny was short for Emmanuel or Manford or Matifold or- - Manhattan. - No. I love Manny and it's time you knew the truth. - And I love Tiffany. Even if her standard of living is not as high as ours. Still, I heard of your tragedy and came to offer comfort. - Isn't he wonderful? - I also want to offer you this. You have experienced the loss of your younger brother. I came to give you one of mine. Come, come. (Indian music) Take your pick. - Everything's fine, Tulip. - Oh, I saw you on the "Today" show. You looked really cute. - Yeah, national TV. Pretty cool, huh. - I think you're really brave to do this. Do you think that they'd kidnap me with you? - No, you're an only child. Your parents would get really worried. Look, I'll be home on Saturday. - Well, call me when you get back, Scooter, okay? - [Scooter] Okay, Tulip, bye. - Scoots, how do I look? - I think if you keep eating like that, you're gonna need one size bigger. - I'm having the time of my life, kid. If I would've known the rich had it so good, I would have tried harder. We're not gonna hang out in the room all day, are we? This place ain't for me, kid. Let's get out to the real world. (horn blows) - Fat chance. Oh, we got some money big shot? - Hey, guys. Say hello to my friend, Scooter. He's in disguise. It's a long story. - My horses run any slower, we'll have all night to listen, hi, Scooter. - Hi. - Yeah, it's always the same, win a little, lose a lot. - Say, how about a tip on the race tomorrow? - I don't be anymore, Elmo. I'm gonna get some hot dogs and beer for everybody. - Hey, that's a great idea. - Well, I'll have three big shot. - Come on, Scooter. - I'll wait here. - We'll meet you in the grandstand. Say, how'd you get to know Clive? - We have a business arrangement. - That's good, because he needs some help right now. You know, he's a lot smarter than he looks. - If you say so. - You know he don't like to brag, but let me tell you, kid, he was an absolute genius with horses. See, he had this plan to win big, real big. Said it was fool proof. - There goes that word again. - So, we put every dime we could, put all our money on Clive's horses, three grand. - Three grand? - $3,000. He said we should parlay. - What's parlay? - Nah, listen, listen, we win the first five races, right? We're up $19,000. You know what kind of money that is? - Lunch money for a year? - No. Ain't that cute? He said we should quit while we were ahead, but, see, one more win would've tripled our money, so we out voted him, put the whole bundle on Piece of Cake, lost by a nose. - Yeah, he blames himself, but he swore he'd get us the money back. - What kind of system did Clive have? - Simple handicapping, but he used a different variable. Amazing thing was it worked. - Up until the last race. Say, do you guys remember what horses Clive bet on that day? - Who could forget? Here's the program right here. He autographed it right there. (people chattering) - Okay, who gets the sauerkraut? - Clive, I think I know what's wrong with your parlay calculation. - Who's been talking to the kid? - Hey, he asked me. - Yeah. - Don't blame them, Clive. Look, I can perfect your system. - What? - All right, I've got everything. The track conditions, the horses, the jockeys that ran on that day and you were exactly right up until the sixth race. But you didn't realize one thing, that Piece of Cake was out of her mutter and couldn't run fast on a good track. - That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. - Look, I know that my computer can handicap better than any person. And I bet we can win back all their money. - I quit money. I'm getting the money as a reward. - Come on, Clive, where's your sense of adventure? - I say we take a chance, get it back. - Yeah, I agree with Elmo. Besides, what have we got to lose? - How about money? - Let's take a vote. - Another vote? - Yeah, we accept. - All right, Clive, but I'm gonna need your help. You know all the horses. What do you say? - Don't have any money kid, sorry. - Look, as soon as we pay our bill at the hotel, we'll still have 1,200 left. Come on. - Let me see that form. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Today was the best day of my life, guys, thanks a lot. - Lord have mercy, $20,000 in one day. I haven't made that much in the past 10 years. Boy, that computer of yours is great. - Computer? It was me. That's right. And you ain't seen nothing yet. This is just the beginning. I'm back. - Hey, buddy, calm down. I know you excited, but- - Damn right I'm excited. You know I'm even expecting more money on Saturday. If I pushed a hundred grand- - Clive, where would you get a hundred grand? - What's gotten into him? - It's called success. But don't worry, as soon as he loses a few, he'll be back to normal again. - Yeah, sure, right. - You know, fellas, I think I'm gonna thank the Lord for my winnings. Why don't y'all come go with me. - Yeah, Clive, come on. - No way. Hey, I gotta go back to the hotel and check the horses for tomorrow, kid. I got a lot of work to do. - Come on, Clive. You said I should experience new things. - Yeah, come on. - Okay, but for a few minutes, okay. ♪ What do you have to say for yourself ♪ ♪ When the time comes and you meet your maker ♪ ♪ Aha ♪ ♪ If you should die in your sleep tonight ♪ ♪ Will you be able to look the Lord straight ♪ ♪ In the face and ask him to let ♪ ♪ You enter into the pearly gates of heaven ♪ ♪ Aha ♪ ♪ Or will you be standing there ♪ ♪ Face to face with old Satan himself ♪ ♪ Spending an eternity in hell fire and damnation ♪ ♪ Damnation ♪ ♪ Who here's a sinner tonight ♪ ♪ Are you a liar ♪ ♪ Are you a gambler ♪ ♪ Are you a backslider ♪ ♪ Are you a peep ♪ ♪ 'Cause nobody knows the time ♪ ♪ When God gonna be calling on the glory ♪ ♪ So get ready for the judgment day ♪ ♪ Take stock in your life ♪ ♪ And tell the Lord, tell him, tell him ♪ ♪ You're gonna live the rest of your life ♪ ♪ To have here on this beautiful day ♪ ♪ Or do you wanna go to hell ♪ ♪ Do you wanna go to heaven ♪ ♪ Do you wanna be a sinner ♪ ♪ Do you wanna be saved ♪ ♪ Do you wanna repent ♪ ♪ Can you look Jesus in the face ♪ (upbeat music) ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Well, I'm waiting for the mornin' ♪ ♪ Of that very special day ♪ ♪ When Gabriel's gonna come come along ♪ ♪ Gonna take us on the way ♪ ♪ Gonna say child I seen your suffering ♪ ♪ Your days of pain are gone ♪ ♪ Come on, take my hand ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take you shore, yes ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me, yeah ♪ ♪ When I get to the golden streets ♪ ♪ Gonna let the fire hit my feet ♪ ♪ Gonna be dancing in the air ♪ ♪ I'm gonna tell them everywhere ♪ ♪ What the Lord has done for me ♪ ♪ And opened doors I could not see ♪ ♪ He made me feel all right ♪ ♪ I'm gonna ask everyone tonight, yeah ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me now ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Go with me, go with me, yeah ♪ ♪ Go with me to my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me ♪ ♪ Everybody get up ♪ ♪ Everybody get up ♪ ♪ Everybody stand up ♪ ♪ Everybody stand up ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me to my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me to my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ - Where did Clive go? - Where is he?

Oh, I love you, you're a charmer. - Scary to think how close we came to throwing it all away. - I know. Jeffrey, sometimes I love you so much it hurts. - I missed you, honey. - Me, too. - I really need you, you know that. - Oh, I need you. (Sterling knocks) - [Sterling] Dad, are you awake? - Yeah, but I'm still dreaming. - Go ahead, darling. I'm not going anywhere. - Okay. Sterling, wait for me downstairs in the office. I'll be right there. - [Sterling] Okay. - You know, seriously, that's my best work. Don't you think? What's on your mind, son? - Dad, there's something you gotta know. - [Jeffrey] What's that? - Your kid's a thief. - [Jeffrey] Who, Scooter? - No, me. - [Jeffrey] What are you talking about? - Dad, for the past couple of years, I've been running this business. It's called Beverly Hills Midnight Sales. - [Jeffrey] Your own business at your age. I'm proud of you, son. - You won't be when you hear what kind of business it was. I buy and sell stolen property. - [Jeffrey] You mean like real estate? - No, stolen cars, Dad. (toilet flushes) - Stolen cars. Sterling, I had no idea. - Didn't you ever wonder where I got a new car every other day? - Well, I just thought Lillian was renting them for you. - Dad, they were hot. I just put my personalized plates on them and nobody ever noticed. - My God, son, this is grand theft auto, a whole lot of times. - I grossed a quarter of a million dollars, you know. - You what? - My books. (dog breathes heavy) - My, my, my, you certainly have a head for business, son. - You think? - Oh, absolutely. You know I have this little cellular car phone business and I am not happy with the way it's being run. How'd you like to take it over for me. - You mean it? - Absolutely. If you can handle my business the way you handle Midnight Sales, I'd say I found myself a new partner. On two conditions. Number one, that you give back everything you've stolen and, number two, that you promise you will never, ever do anything illegal again, unless of course you go into politics. - It's a deal. - We're gonna be billionaires. - Clive, yesterday was fantastic. I didn't know things like that even existed. I've made up my mind. I'm not going back. - What? - I'm not going back. Clive, I wanna live with you. It'll be great. You and me on the road and we'll travel and I'll see all the stuff that I've never even seen before. - Listen, Scooter. - Wait, I know what you're gonna say. We don't have that much money left, but we can get more. With your brains and with my computer, there's nothing we can't do, Clive. We can even live in your car. - Listen, kid, we had a wonderful couple of days, right? You needed someone to listen to you and I needed someone to show me how far I fell. But the fun's over. Your family worries about you and I gotta bring you home. - I'll send them postcards. They don't really care if I'm there. Look, as soon as they find out I'm okay, they'll forget all about me. - Scooter, we can't. - But, Clive, we're a great team. - No. - I thought you cared about me. I thought you were my friend. - I do care about you and you are my friend, buddy. That's why I have to return you to your family. - Well, I won't go and you can't make me. - Okay, kid, I didn't wanna tell you this, but I've been stringing you along to sell high. - I don't understand. - That's right. I've been going along for the money. I want the reward. - Clive, you don't mean that. We're a great team. - Winning yesterday was a fluke. It couldn't happen again, kid. - Yes, it can. - Listen to me, even if it could, you think I want you tagging along with me? I'm a loner. That's right, I made plans for my life and it don't concern hanging out with you. - What do you mean? - I'm tired of it and I don't want you tagging around with me.

You haven't spoken to me in days. - Keep your voice down. Jeffrey will hear me. - Why your sudden concern for your husband? You didn't seem to care before when we were fooling around under his nose, remember? - All that's changed now. We're a family again. This crises has brought us together. - You slept with him, didn't you? - Oh, Roberto. You're a sweet, talented boy, but we both know we were just using each other. You wanted my money and my connections and I wanted your body and what a body. But now it's over. The minute I saw Jeffrey Miller, I knew that he was the love of my life and always would be. Somewhere along the way we got sidetracked, but now our son is in trouble, and when Scooter comes home, and I know he will, I know it, he's gonna need two parents who love each other enough to love him. - Should I finish the Bentley? - No. - No? - No. (dramatic music) - What's going on? - Just shut up and get in there. (door closes) - Who are you guys? What do you want with me? - You're famous. Television, newspapers. Everybody's looking for you, Scooter. - If you know who I am, then you must know about the reward money. - Reward money? You know anything about reward money? - That's peanuts from what I hear. - We're looking to hit the lottery, you know, the jackpot, the ransom, 2 million. - Simoleons. - My dad can't afford 2 million. - But your grandma can and she's more loaded than your old man. - Can I please call my family? - Absolutely, would you get him the phone, please. - I'll go ahead and set up the exchange for you, I mean, for the 2 million simoleons and anything else you guys want. (rotary dials) - Dammit, there's one thing here. We gotta prove to them that we snatched you. - How? - Take his fingerprints. - You're gonna send them my fingerprints? - No, we're gonna send them one of your fingers. - And then one of your little ears. - Piece by piece until they all fit like a puzzle. - No, please, I didn't even do anything to you guys. You can't kill me. I don't wanna be dead. - We're not butchers, you know. - Yeah, prove to him that we are not butchers. Hack off his finger very nicely. - Please, I didn't do anything to you. I can't stand pain. - Well, you Beverly Hills brats mortify me. You whine and you think you can get anything that you want. - It's just that I'm too young to suffer. - What the hell do you know about suffering? How'd you like to be illegitimate like him? Never knowing your old man. - Yeah. - But I can sympathize with that. - And what about me and my old lady. She kissed the ground one everyone that walked except me. Look at me, kid. - Sir. - Yes, sir, what sir? - My sister and her friends are adopting some poor children. Maybe you guys can still qualify. - Yeah, that's the way it is in Beverly Hills. - You know, kid. Until I was a year old, I was used as a flyswatter. - I'm very sorry, sir. If I've implied in any way that our lives- - Ch-ch-ch. Enough kid. I don't like anybody talking to, over or under. (dramatic music) (man grunts) - Clive! (punch strikes) (furniture crashed) - Scooter, you okay? - I'm fine, Clive. (gun cocks) - Some kind of hero this guy is. (kicks strike) Now what? - I'm thinking. Okay, I got it. - What? What do you wanna do? - Take him to the wagon. (slow blues music) - Clive. Clive. I'm really sorry. This is all my fault. If I hadn't have run away. - No, I shouldn't have told you I don't like you. - I know, Clive. You're a great guy and you really are my friend. - (laughs) Thank you, Scooter. - Clive, do you believe in reincarnation? - What? - Well, they say when two people feel like they've known each other forever, it's because they were friends in a past lifetime. - Looks like we're gonna be friends in the next one. - Are they gonna kill us, Clive? - Seems that way kid. - Is there anything we can do? - Well, maybe at church we bought ourselves a favor or two with the guy upstairs, who knows. - [Spider] Hey, shut up back there. (slow blues music) - Now what? - You'll see. Let's get them out of the van. Cut 'em loose. Get the fat guy. - Why don't we just shoot them here? - Just get 'em into the damn car. (door slams) - Come on, come on. Come on. - Clive! Don't man, he's bleeding. - Get in. When do we collect the damn money? - When the car goes over the cliff. - When will that be? - Soon, real soon, start it up. - Why don't we just shoot them here? - 'Cause the coroner will find bullet holes, will you start it up. (engine revs) (dramatic music) - Explain that lottery to me again. - Later, just push. Trust me. - What a mind. - One more. - Clive, you're okay. - I've been getting away with this game for years. - What a mind. - Hey, what's going on? (gun fires) Come on, get in the van, let's go. (dramatic music) - Step on it, man. Why don't you just catch up to them. You gonna let them get away? - Head up for the hills, Clive. - Kid, there's all dead ends there. - Trust me. Now go right. - Good boy, Scooter. - I'm gonna get that fatso. - [Police 1] We have an unauthorized vehicle entering the driveway. - [Police 2] Police, hold it right there. - [Scooter] I'm Montgomery Miller and those are my kidnappers. - Don't move. - Well, you got your wish. - What wish? - Topeka, Kansas. - I'll never trust you again. - [Reporter] Scooter, look this way, one more, smile for me. - Scooter, did you ever feel that your kidnappers were going to harm you? - Harm me, man, they were gonna kill me, but not until they cut off my ear and my finger. - Scooter, with all that stuff coming down, I don't suppose you were scared? - Not really. I had Clive here to save me. - Yes, Mr. Belnap, you are quite a hero, but how did you know where the boy was being held. - Scoots and I go back a very, very long time and whenever the kid has trouble, I seem to know it. - What are you gonna do with the reward money? - I might open up a private school here in Beverly Hills and take the kids on little trips. - [Reporter 2] Excuse me, Mr. Belnap. - No, no, that's enough, ladies and gentlemen. No, no, please, come on now, no more. The family would really like to be alone for a while. Thank you very much. Please stay off the grass. Bye-bye. - Where are you going? - Your father said the family would like some time alone. - Clive, you saved my son's life. I'd say that makes you part of the family now. - What's this for? - It's a key to the guest house. Roberto is no longer with us, it's all yours. - Thanks, pal. - Thank you, Clive. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Well, I'm waiting for the morning ♪ ♪ Of that very special day ♪ ♪ When Gabriel's gonna come along ♪ ♪ Gonna take our sorrow away ♪ ♪ Gonna say child I'll seen your suffering ♪ ♪ Your days of pain are gone ♪ ♪ Now come on, take my hand ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take you to the shore, yeah ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me, yeah ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me, yeah ♪ ♪ When I hit the golden streets ♪ ♪ Gonna let the fire hit my feet ♪ ♪ Gonna be dancing in the air ♪ ♪ I'm gonna tell it everywhere ♪ ♪ What the Lord has done for me ♪ ♪ He opened doors I could not see ♪ ♪ He made me feel all right ♪ ♪ I'm gonna ask everyone tonight ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me now ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Go with me now ♪ ♪ Go with me, yeah, ♪ ♪ Go with me, yeah ♪ ♪ Go with me now ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Go with me ♪ ♪ Everybody get up ♪ ♪ Everybody get up ♪ ♪ Everybody stand up ♪ ♪ Everybody stand up ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To My Father's house ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ Come and go with me ♪ (upbeat music) ♪ Ooh, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ You can burn in the heat of the sun ♪ ♪ You can crash having too much fun ♪ ♪ Even love can be overdone ♪ ♪ But you can't have too much money ♪ ♪ Well, well ♪ ♪ Too much work takes you to the grave ♪ ♪ Too much to eat, too much to drink ♪ ♪ Well, my friend no matter what you think ♪ ♪ You just can't have too much money ♪ ♪ Why should we be denied of money ♪ ♪ No one ever died of money ♪ ♪ Don't be shy ♪ ♪ Come on and get your share ♪ ♪ Well, I'm telling you for your own good ♪ ♪ You can be a modern Robin Hood ♪ ♪ And the cash is all understood ♪ ♪ And you can't have too much money ♪ ♪ Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ (technological music)
