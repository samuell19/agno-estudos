Oh, my god. Oh, [bleep]. Coming up on "pit bulls & parolees"... Are you sick? It's in heart failure, probably. Oh, my god. Lizzy: I've seen a lot of dogs come in in heart failure. This is the largest abdomen I've ever seen. Wow. You want to keep hope, but it's really hard. Hello. How are you? So how long ago did you get out? I got out last week. Frank: I'm from boston, massachusetts. I got something for you. And I feel like a piece of crap for the way I've behaved for these 13 years. -Hello? -Hey. I just want my son to be proud of me for something, and I've never been more ready. -Okay. -Ah! Hi! She's gonna show you the belly! The belly's coming! There it is! -Ah, there's the belly! -There it is! Like, at home, like, what do you do? Oh, you guys go on a boat? Okay. Whoo-hoo! There we go. What? What you think? What you think? my name is tia maria torres. For more than 20 years, I've run a sanctuary dedicated to second chances. It's for over 300 pit bulls, the world's most misunderstood breed of dog, and for parolees -- the guys I hire because no one else will. My family and I have devoted our lives to saving these dogs we love so much. From louisiana swamps to the streets of new orleans, the city of second chances. Our mission is to rescue, but my hope is one day we won't have to. tia: Having a program that employs people coming out of prison and on parole, and working with the dogs -- it's not only vital to our needs physically. The dogs get that extra attention, plus the men or women receiving such a sense of accomplishment... How you doing, bud? ...It's a win-win on so many fronts. Just do your thing, buddy. They all feed dogs, clean kennels, walk dogs, maintenance work, construction work. They are the soldiers. They are the backbone behind what we do. Hi. -How you doing? Come on down here. Tia: Up until recently, you know, we only hired parolees that were local. This is the lady. -Hi. -Hey, how you doing? -Tia. -Sui. Sui, hi. Tia: After receiving a letter from a parolee out of the boston area named frank, it just got me thinking that, you know, maybe we can expand. [ cellphone rings ] hello? Hey, frank. Tia: When hearing frank's story, I learned that it was his 13-year-old son who asked his dad to take a chance and get ahold of us. So frank wrote me a letter, told me his story. I thought it was really sweet, you know, that it was his son that was the one that kind of gave him the boost and the confidence to write us. All right. So you gonna be heading out, or have you got everything worked out? After corresponding with him a few times and then ultimately talking to his case worker in prison, the decision was made to come out here to louisiana and give it a try. Okay, then we will just keep in touch. This is gonna be an interesting situation because we've never hired somebody on parole from out of state. Okay, see you soon. Bye. today we have a really sweet couple come out from florida to meet some of our dogs for adoption. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. How are you? -Hi. I'm tia. -Hi, tia. I'm tina. -Tina, okay. Hi. I'm rob. My name is rob, and my wife, tina, and I came out here to find a dog that needs a home. This weather -- I wish it would make up its mind. -I know. It's crazy. -I know. We're from florida, though, so we see the same thing. I believe in rescuing an animal because they need wonderful homes. They've been through so much. So what part of florida are y'all from? Just southeast of orlando, the orlando area. Okay. We've actually known each other since high school. -Yeah. -And you still like each other? -We went our separate ways. -Oh! Oh, my god. Oh, you dated in high school, and then went... -Dated in high school. -We did. Rob: I went in the military. She didn't remember or realize that I was leaving... No, I didn't know. ...Until I was already gone. I don't know. Several years ago, we found each other on facebook, of all places... Oh, my gosh, yeah. ...And we got married two years ago. -Oh, my gosh! Really? -Yes. After all that time since high school? Fate brought us back together a few years ago, and we've talked about having a dog. When we decided it was time, then we started figuring out how to come out here and rescue a dog from villalobos. You've had dogs before? You had a pit bull before? What's your whole dog history? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, growing up, we always had either pits or rottweilers. Uh-huh. Oh, okay. You're comfortable around bigger dogs, yeah. Oh, absolutely. So this will be your first dog as a couple? -As a couple. -As a couple, yes. It's like having a child. Oh, my gosh. -Mm-hmm. Gonna be having a new baby. Yeah, a new baby. I'm extremely excited to meet all of these dogs. I can't wait. I would take them all home with me if I had the opportunity. Like, at home, like, what do you do? What, do you go places during the weekends? You just kind of hang out at home? -We hang out at home a lot... -We're boaters. -Oh, you guys go on a boat? -Yeah. -What kind of boat do you have? -24 pontoon. Okay. I am already retired, and pretty much my life consists of fishing and doing stuff around the house. We're looking for a medium, you know, a mid -- kind of in between hyper and -- yeah, we don't want -- so something affectionate but can still go for a walk. -You got it. -Yeah, okay. You know, what they wanted was a dog that was kind of in the middle. We brought three different dogs out that we think might fit... -Great. -...The bill. Think we're gonna start with ej. Okay. Tia: Ej was a stray. Actually, earl got the call from his old neighborhood in new orleans. So earl went there and scooped him up, and he became ej -- earl junior. I think the thing that people really notice about ej the most is his drop-dead-gorgeous, looks, like, oh, stud muffin. He is the best of both worlds. He can be a very laid-back dog and then, you know, want to go out and do stuff. -Beautiful. -So here are the earls. -Hello, earl! -Earl and earl. Says, "no, no. I already know you." this is earl's little namesake, his little baby. He's been with us for almost five years. We got him when he was a puppy. -Yeah. -He's a beautiful boy. Yeah, he is. He's a really good-looking boy. Ej was a beautiful dog -- very strong, very beautiful coloring. You're really pretty. -Come on. -He likes the camera. -Ej! -Come here, buddy. Oh, he's getting a little frisky now. Earl: Come on, ej. We tired of you, man. Go on up. -He's, like, posing right now. -He is. -Taking all the wind, too. He's posing for the camera. -Ej, come say hello, my boy. -Come here, over here. So tell them -- dude. You are adorable. Yes, yes. All right. Tia: You know, ej did pay more attention to us than the adopters. You know, with these meet-and-greets, it's hard to say how the dogs are gonna act. Some dogs are like, "ooh! New person!" you know? And there's dogs that are like ej, that are like, "ugh. New person? Pfft. Whatever." it is what it is. -Next one will be cranberry. -Okay. Tia: Cranberry was brought to us as a stray right around thanksgiving time. We became suspicious when the good samaritan who "found her" went to walk away, and cranberry just went crazy trying to chase after the person and was crying. So it was pretty obvious that this was, like, her owner. Cranberry has a very sweet personality, loves to snuggle, but at the same time, she's got a little bit of giddyap-and-go in her, too. Good girl, chunky monkey. Good girl. -Look at her! -Hi. -Hi! Oh, you are so pretty. -I just said, she's so chunky. You should have been named stuffing 'cause you're so chubby. -Ooh! -You're a potato. -You're too chubby. -Look at those snorts. Oh, I love it! Oh, I love the sn-- oh, yes! Seeing cranberry, I was very happy to see her. She was so pretty. Her markings are gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. -Cranberry, come here. -She's okay. And she's, like, 4 1/2. She's like, "they just got me so excited. Look, I'm so excited." -oh! -She's beautiful. -Look at that. -Look at that beautiful beige. Get her on the couch? Cranberry's a beautiful dog. -She's... -Look at her. -Are you posing? -Come on. -She's posing. -She is 100% posing. -She's beautiful. -What are you doing? -Hey. Look. -Oh, look how pretty she is. She's like, "I'm just gonna sit here from now on." rob: She warmed up more than ej did, but she still seemed to be a bit standoffish to us, personally. Okay, so the next dog that mariah's bringing out is nikita. Tia: Nikita was a stray brought in through the assumption parish jail, just a really outgoing girl, super like, "here I am!" you know, I'm hoping nikita might be a contender. I mean, she is younger, a little bit more wild than the other two, you know, so I just think she has a big personality, and I think that, you know, she'll show herself really well. Okay, this is nikita. -Hi! -She is the youngest. She's 2 1/2. -Oh! -She's so affectionate. -I love her stockings. -She's so affectionate. -I love your stockings. I do. Rob: When I turned and saw nikita coming through, right away, she got my attention. She was walking proud. -Hi, pretty girl. -Hello! Oh, yeah! She's such a good puppy. Tina: Instantly, there was a connection with nikita, sort of like when you first see a newborn baby, all of a sudden, there's an instant smile. She's about to show you the belly! The belly's coming! There it is! -There's the belly! -There it is! That's her signature move. Oh, yeah! Tina: She wanted belly rubs from the start. She instantly wanted to be loved. -Good girl! -Oh, okay. Okay, so... -Good job. So you're -- oh, you're a snuggler, too. Okay. Oh! -Look. She's -- -she's sticking up her tail. [ laughing ] oh, yeah! Yeah! -There you go. -Oh, that's great! -She's like, "hold me!" -oh, I love it! -"hold me. Let me kiss you." -yeah. Oh! Look at that smile. She is grinning from ear to ear right now. -She is. She is. -Are you happy? [ laughs ] yeah? Does that mean yes, you are happy? Are you happy? Yeah? You happy? Nikita came out and said, "I know how to do this. You get some of me, and you get some of me." -all right. Come on. -All right. -She knows. -Come on. She says, "all right. I laid it on thick enough." come on. Let's go. Come on. [smooches] good girl. She's like, "okay, we're good now." where do you want to go? Oh, no! She's like, "tricked you." "I was not done." she laid the charm on, big time. Nikita just stole our hearts right away. We didn't even have to talk about it. It's like we looked at each other, and was like, "nikita." didn't even have to, like, discuss it. You both just turned around and said, "boop! Same dog." mariah: Maybe he felt the same connection with her that he got with you. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's a little bit better with her. [ laughter ] like, he has got all the answers. Oh, yeah. I knew she chose us from the moment she jumped on that couch. She tugged on our heartstrings. So that kind of made it an easy choice. -Thank you so much. -Nice meeting you. I'm just glad you guys really had that... -It was instant. -...Strong -- it was. Rob and tina mentioned that they really enjoy being out on their pontoon boat and fishing, and they would love for nikita to come with them. Thank you, guys. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Bye-bye. So tia and myself are gonna go ahead and get her on a boat and see how she reacts to the water. -Wait. -Are you opening her door? -You're opening her door? -Yes! Tia: Oh, come on! Mariah: If everything goes as planned, and nikita ends up with rob and tina, I'm just gonna be over-the-moon excited for her. [ cellphone rings ] hey. -Hey. -What's up? I was driving into work when one of our employees, heidi, called me about a pregnant dog underneath a underpass not far from the rescue. Oh. -Yeah. Maybe it's in heart failure, or it has, like, a tumor. Although it would be very hard for us to take on a litter of puppies right now, I would rather it be a female dog that's pregnant than a dog who is in heart failure that is that severe because the chances of survival are pretty small. Oh, my god. Oh, [bleep]. oh, my god. Oh, [bleep]. Oh, my god. Lizzy: I felt so sorry for this dog. Whether it was pregnant or very sick, it's just so sad that this dog is underneath this bridge alone and probably terrified. Hi. Are you sick, or do you have babies? Or are you a boy? Hi. Lizzy: It's dirty, and there's glass, and the whole thing is just pretty heartbreaking. I'm gonna just get a little closer and just see how it reacts to me. Hi, my angel. Hi. Are you sick? -You want the wet food? -Yeah. You're gonna like this chicken. Yep, it's using its abdominal muscles to breathe, and normally that's heart. The dog was breathing using its abdominal muscles, and that's another sign of heart failure. Okay, yeah, food's not gonna work. I did try to toss it some food just to gain some trust, and it smelled it but had no interest in eating, another really bad sign. Okay, I'm just gonna have to go up to it, just gonna take my chances on you. Okay? Hi. Hi. I think you're just not feeling well, okay? Okay. Can you walk? Oh! Look at it from over here. Come over here. She's fine with people. Look at her. -Oh, no. -Okay, baby. Can you walk? Can you walk? [bleep] I don't think she can walk. Okay, baby. Okay. God, this dog is in really bad shape. Wow. It's... This is a boy. It's in heart failure. Oh, my god. Let's not hurt him. Lizzy: I've seen a lot of dogs come in in heart failure, and this is the largest abdomen I've ever seen. Oh, my god. I feel so bad pushing on it. It's okay, love. It's okay. We're gonna help you. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. This dog was extremely sick, and we needed to get to the vet right away. Gonna take care of you. Heidi and I were trying to come up with a name that we felt was suitable for him, and we landed on sebastian. He just looked like a sebastian. It just seemed like that was his name. we got him to the vet as quickly as possible. -Where we going? -Oh, right there. -Just unscrew... -Yeah. Lizzy: Just some of ours are, like, pretty... He's kind of sliding out. -Oh, never mind. -Hey, big man. Oh. -Oh, okay. -Here we go. -Hey, sweetie. Oh, man. -I feel so bad for him. Wow. Wow. Yeah, he's pretty pale. All right. Dr. Samantha: He was very, very weak. His gum color was very, very pale, and his abdomen, of course, was extremely distended, and it palpated as fluid. So I was, you know, immediately concerned that we needed to get him stabilized quickly and sort out the underlying problem going on. It's a really, really high-grade murmur. Mm-hmm. Sounds like both sides of the heart. So it could, of course, be primary heart disease or heartworm -- like, severe heartworm. I'm sure you guys have seen some. Definitely looks like heart-failure fluid. Dr. Samantha: When I see that amount of fluid, it did look characteristic of heart-failure fluid to me. What I didn't know was, was that a primary heart condition he had, or was that secondary to heartworm disease? It's possible. I don't think he's quite in caval, but he could be close to that direction. Man. Dr. Samantha: Caval syndrome is when you have almost, like, a bunch of heartworms that have dislodged themselves, and usually that dog presents, you know, in collapse in a very serious condition, and he's right there. Yeah, we definitely need to drain a lot of this off. That's why his breathing is so labored -- because he has so much pressure on his diaphragm. We definitely need to get some x-rays of his heart and then drain all of this fluid. I'm guessing we'll probably get about a liter off of him. We've seen dogs in similar condition not as bad and not make it. So you want to keep hope, but it's really hard. So it was high, high, high heartworm-positive, like, microfilaria everywhere. I don't think we're quite in caval yet, although I think we could be teetering on that, and we're super, super high risk for during treatment. Even though we sort of expected that prognosis, it still hurts to hear that. And you just immediately think about the life that this dog has had, and that it's probably been horrible. So all of this whiteness back here is just his pulmonary vasculature that's super dilated and enlarged from the amount of worms that he has. Lizzy: That's his heart pushing on it? Yeah, his heart being enlarged, too. And that's why he's coughing or, like, chuffing, I guess. Mm-hmm. Sebastian's x-rays showed a severely enlarged heart from the burden of worms that are living in it. So the actual veins coming down from the heart that are supplying the lungs were extremely dilated, and that's because they're actually filled with worms, and the pressure is extremely high in those, too, from the worms being there. At this point, 35 maybe, through all of treatment. I could tell by his x-rays that we were in a serious state, dr. Samantha: You know, I think right now, we start with getting the heart more functional, draining the fluid, getting him stabilized, and if he makes it through the stabilization, then we move into the treatment phase. Okay. So it's really gonna be very step-by-step with him. All we can do is hope for the best and hope that he makes it through the night and wait for an update. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. tia: You know, normally we start the new employees at the new orleans warehouse just to have them learn the ropes. Mariah: Hello. How are you? So when frank got to new orleans, I had mariah teach him the ins and outs of working here at the rescue. When you wipe down the beds and the inside of the house, no one dries it off afterwards, and it's all wet. It gets disgusting, so make sure you dry it. I'm frank from boston, massachusetts. Thank you. Coming from a, you know, whole 'nother state, you know, from massachusetts coming to louisiana, you know, starting fresh, you know, it's... I'm excited, but I'm nervous. Check this out. I got something for you. Here. Come over here. I got something for you. This is a great opportunity for me. It's something that I love doing. My dog was a pit bull. Look at those eyes! You're gonna have all the ladies. Pit bulls are loving, loyal, and they're looked at not in those ways by a lot of people. You came from boston, right? Okay. Yeah, how long ago did you get out? Um, I got out last week. Oh, [bleep]. How long were you in for? Almost, like, 2 1/2 years. Okay, and this is your first time in new orleans? I just keep going back, and that's the problem. Let's not do that. [ laughs ] it's been quite the about decade now of just in and out of jails, a whole waste of a little more than 10 years. I've been incarcerated for firearm possession, drug distribution, motor-vehicle theft. I'm on unsupervised probation for 2 1/2 years. If I violate, I'm going to jail for 2 1/2 years. I think that after awhile, and it happens with all of us, things become mundane, and you, like -- you start to lose focus on where your original goals were. And I think that's the biggest thing that working with the dogs -- that it keeps you focused on it. I love them. I love it. And when I have a bad day, it fixes everything. I'm so focused. I've never felt, you know, so positive. Good. I basically have zero -- a big, fat goose egg right now -- as far as things and finances. When I came to ms. Torres, the fact that she was able to say, "you know, I'm gonna hire you," that was like a blessing from god and ms. Torres. Well, I'm glad you're here. If you need anything, don't be shy. I'll let you get back to kennels. Yeah. Either way, I'm glad you're here. -Nice to meet you. -You, too. I'll see you tomorrow. -All right. It is extremely important to me that I do great here. Here you go, baby. I have a 13-year-old boy, and he knows I got the job now. Come on, buddy. And he knows that I'm from the streets. And, you know, I feel really like a piece of crap for the way I've behaved for these 13 years, you know, and I want to do something positive. This way, bud. Come on. [smooches] come on. I just want my son to be proud of me for something. kissies. All right. You ready? -Oh, my gosh. -Are you ready? -Okay. -She's so excited. Rob and tina are adopters from florida. -Oh! -Look at that smile. She is grinning from ear to ear right now. -She is. She is. -Are you happy? Yeah? Tia: And like so many people in florida, boating is a part of their everyday life. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Hut, hut, hut! Tia: We need to make sure that nikita is gonna feel comfortable with this type of situation. Look at how excited you are! Come here. You know, I've seen dogs that just do great with it, and then I've seen dogs that do horrible with being near a boat. So I'm gonna have to see. What do you think? You're okay. Oh, you're okay. Hey, you're okay. That's a big thing, huh? Want to jump on? Here, I'm gonna hold it close. [ smooches ] you want to go? -Come on. -Come on. Good girl! That was such a good girl. Tia: Thinking that we were gonna have to use treats to coax her onto the boat, I didn't have time. She just hopped on behind me and like, "lets go. Let's do this!" you're so excited. Oh, my goodness. All right. I think we're good to go. I think it's when it turns on, I'm kind of worried about the sound maybe. [ smooches ] what you think? [ boat beeping ] [ engine starts ] good girl. We'll just hang for a little bit. Good girl. Just hang for a little bit. She didn't react. Actually, she felt very comfortable, I think. Okay, let's see if I'm tied off here. Nope. It was time to head out and see how she does. That's a good girl. Whoo-hoo! What you think? It's moving, huh? We'll go slow. Yeah, it's moving a little bit. Tia: Now, going down the canal here, the water's very calm. -Aw. -There you go. Good girl. So it was a great way to start off our little adventure. Look at that tail wagging. Nikita actually seemed very excited. It was really cute. There we go. But of course, the big test is to actually go out on the lake where the water is a little bit rougher, and you just have that big body of water in front of you. What? What you think? What you think? You like the boat? Hm? It's like she was born to be out on the water. Go a little bit faster. I picked up speed. That didn't seem to bother her too much. And when you picked up the speed, the motor got a little bit louder, too. Yeah, yeah. She's super. Didn't seem to faze her. You know, not only did she feel comfortable with being in the boat, she loved it. You did so good, baby. Mm-hmm. So good. Yes, you did. To our knowledge, she's never seen a boat, never been on a boat, and just how confident and laid-back she was, you know, just goes to show what a great dog nikita is. Come on. I know you're coming. You know, the next step is getting nikita loaded up and getting her off to florida. I mean, how perfect that she's gonna the sunshine state. [ laughs ] you're a good country girl, huh? this is meatball. He is around 9 years old and has been with us for 7 of those. Your face. I wuv you. His family unfortunately couldn't care for him anymore because he was going through heartworm treatment. Meatball is now heartworm negative, thankfully, and he does love other dogs, but he has some arthritis, so playing would have to be kept to a mild minimum. He does love to go on walks but prefers the couch. If you're interested in adopting meatball or donating to villalobos rescue center, just make sure when you go in, that -- try and pull on that fence to make sure one of them can't get under it. Okay. I like working with mariah. She teaches me, you know, everything the right way, no cutting corners. Okay. Frank and I were doing kennels, and elise called me and said that there was a dog that just got brought in. I'm gonna have frank so he can come learn. I'm gonna have him come help. -Yep, that would be perfect. -Okay, perfect. We'll be out in a minute. -All right. Okay. Elise is out front with this dog right now. Will you -- I'm gonna show you how to use the microchip scanner and stuff. Yeah. So you want to come out with me real quick? Um... Oh, right there. So frigging handsome. Frank: Hey, buddy. So sometimes the microchip, if they have them, they'll move, like, down in their shoulders. So you literally have to do it everywhere, but... [ beep ] oh, it's right there. I'm like -- no, so they scan them right here, and this is -- that's his microchip number. So we're gonna call the company and look that up. This is just -- like, rescues and shelters have this. You go to the vet, and they microchip your dog. That way if, like, the collar comes off anything... -They get lost. -...Yeah, in a shelter, or anyone finds them, like, they can still find you. Frank: I have a thing where I'll do something good for a whole week, and I'm like, "yeah, I'm bored." so that's why this time around when I was sitting in prison thinking about what it is I want to do with myself, I had to find something that I'd never get bored doing. Elise: He's also neutered -- looks like maybe, like, spca 'cause he's got the tattoo. Mariah: Does he have the mark, the tattoo? Yeah, he has the tattoo. -Do you know about that? -No. The spca -- when they spay or neuter dogs, they do, like, a tiny, little tattoo on them so that you know already that they are. -Really? -Mm-hmm. -Where's his tattoo? -They put them... There's, like, a tiny tag. -It's on this side. He has one? -Yeah. -Oh, yeah, the blue. See that blue mark right there inside his leg? -Yeah, it's... -That's so that you know. -...Like a line. -Uh-huh. And then they tattoo them so you know. They do it while they're sedated already. -Wow. -Mm-hmm. Frank: I didn't have a clue about that tattoo thing on the spayed and neutered dogs. The more I learn stuff like that, I feel, you know, official here. It's 982126. Okay. Thank you for your help. Yes. Juice capone? -Yes, juice capone. -Okay. Mariah: When we called the microchip company, this dog had its name, a cellphone number, everything. [ phone disconnect tone ] oh, and it just goes off, too. But the number wasn't working at all. We get dogs in all the time that are microchipped. Sometimes people's dogs genuinely just get loose, and they can't find them. Sometimes they can't care for them anymore and just dump them. So we'll keep trying the phone number that we have, but if no one comes forward, juice will be a vrc dog, and we will try and find him a forever home. I'll go put this back if you guys want to handle that. -Microchip, juice... -Thank you. Now you know how to do it. -...Capone! -Yeah. Come on, big guy. Come on, buddy. lizzy: It's been a couple of days since heidi and I brought sebastian in. Oh, man. Wow. Definitely looks like heart-failure fluid. Yeah, we're definitely gonna drain a lot of this off. So we are here to check on sebastian. -Hi! -Look, he says, "hello." oh, my god. Oh, my god, look how much smaller... He looks different. It was amazing just to see him walking and to see his belly so much smaller. Unfortunately, once all the fluid was drained, you could see how skinny he was. That just kind of shows that we were right to think that nobody was caring for this dog for a very long time. Remember when we thought you were pregnant? He's so precious. I love him. I'm so attached, it's terrible. Dr. Samantha: His personality is just sweet. He wants to be taken care of. He likes it when I sit in there with him and feed him by hand. He's loving all this love and attention. Just so beautiful. He gets so excited when we, like, approach his kennel. Like, he wags his tail 'cause he's like, "I'm gonna get some chicken or go on a walk." he's just a very gentle dog. So do we think his percentage of living is higher? I think it's higher. I mean, I'd still probably say 50/50 at this point. -That's better than 35%. -Yeah. After two days, he's really made great strides. He's gone above what I expected for him. Without 6 1/2 liters on him, he's much more comfortable when he's resting, and he looks pretty good. I feel like we can get his heart stabilized, just how well he's responded to the heart meds within 24 hours. It's just gonna be if he can make it through the treatment. Those heartworm treatments that we do to kill the adult worms are very dangerous. It's necessary but dangerous. He literally has, you could think of, like, spaghetti in his heart right now. So as we're killing these worms, and they die off, we worry that one of them could break off and actually cause, like, a clot and almost a stroke-like event for them. -There you go. -He's tired. -He's tired. -Let's let him rest. Dr. Samantha: I think he's extremely lucky. I'm not sure that he would've made it another night. I mean, he was critical. He is scheduled for an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of his heart. That will give us an idea of where we've gotten medication-wise and, you know, setting the timeline going forward. I'm still, you know, concerned. I want him to pull through, but just having seen what I've seen, I know that it can be very dangerous, and he has a lot of steps left in this process. Bye, sebastian. I'm happy you're alive. Lizzy: I think that he's a fighter, and I think that -- I think that he wants to survive. I really do. Dr. Samantha: Ready to get back to your house? Come on, buddy. yeah. You're gonna be all clean, aren't you? Yeah, you are. Since juice got dropped off, we've been hanging out. Come here. All he wants to do is just play. He's so playful. Bet you can't catch me. [ laughs ] come on. Yeah! You're so cute. Yeah, you are. You're so cute. He's my buddy. Mwah! I think my son would love juice. I know they would be a good match for each other. -Hello? -Hey. What's up, dude? I'm out here with juice. You want to meet juice capone? -Juice? -Can you see him? -Yeah. -Isn't he adorable? -Yeah. -He's such a good boy. He's a big baby. How's it going? How's school going? Frank: My son's always been great in school, you know, and that's hard to get. You know, dorchester's a rough neighborhood. There's so many gangs. It really scares me that he might take the wrong way. It was hard for me to just pick up and leave everything I know and come out here where I know nobody, and especially, you know, leaving you. And... Making my son, jaydel, proud of me is so important to me right now just because the type of life I've been living, you know, and the fact that my son sits back and observes all of that, you know. So what kind of role model am I being for my own boy? What, do I want him to follow in my footsteps? Everything he was saying was right on the money. He is so smart. I'm really happy that you gave me this idea, and just want you to know that I'm gonna do it. You know, I'm gonna get myself a little car, a nice little place. I'm gonna get my life in order. It's very important that I make him proud of me. All right. I love you, buddy. All right. Love you, too. [ smooches ] are you ready? Come on. [ smooches ] are you gonna go buh-bye? Are you gonna? Adorable nikita is headed to her new home today. You're so excited, girl. Hold on. We got to go this way. Got to go this way. Hold on. Nikita is definitely a favorite here at vrc. Everyone just adores her. We're a little sad that she's going 'cause we love her so much, but we can't wait to see her thrive in her new home. Hey, baby. [ cellphone rings ] hello? -Hello. Hey. Yeah, tell me about it. Oh, my god. that doesn't even sound stable, like... Oh, my god. With the husband telling us one thing, and then the wife telling us something different, and it went back and forth. It's like, we're not gonna put our dog in that situation. Oh, my god. I'm so upset right now. Tia: So I just said no. No, I get it. My heart dropped. I just got really sick to my stomach, and it's really hard. Okay. -All right? -All right. -All right, then. -Bye. See you later. Bye. That makes no sense. This is probably the closest we've ever been to an adoption and had the plug pulled on us, and it's so disappointing. Sorry, baby. We're not going anywhere today. Tia: Nikita is a great dog that deserves a great home, but she needs a stable home, a home where we know she's going to be forever. All we can do is keep trying on nikita's behalf, and eventually her forever home will come forward. lizzy: Sebastian has been at the vet for so long, and they have taken such amazing care of him. And dr. Samantha said that he made it through heartworm treatment, and he's already improving. Okay, so he is going home on basically five heart medications. In sebastian's case, the severe load of heartworms has pushed him actually into heart failure. So he still needs to stay calm for the next month while that medication works, and beyond that, we'll just need to watch his heart function, you know, continue to have him follow up with our cardiologist. Hey! Oh, my god. It's so cute. Oh, my god. Isn't he cute? He's put on a lot of weight, too. Oh, my god. And his little ears. At this point I feel pretty confident that, you know, he's gonna make it. He'll survive this ordeal that he's been through. Can't believe it was the same dog under the bridge. I know. Sebastian's been in the hospital for awhile now, so I've really gotten to know him and really created a bond with him. You know, it's a little bittersweet. We're happy to see him go, but we'll miss him around here. -You can have. -Oh, my god, thanks. There you go, sebastian. Some people have a stronger will to fight and keep going, and I think it's the same thing for dogs. And I think that he had, like, that extra fire inside of him to pull through this, and I do think that that's what helped him get through. We are actually taking him to one of our satellite homes where he can continue to recover. Can you close the gate? [ whistles ] we just feel like a quiet, homelike setting is best for him. -So comfy. -Look. Look at -- it's a home. You're home! Comfy. Lizzy: I love him for a lot of reasons. Walking up to him under the overpass and seeing him laying there alone and so sick that he was unable to move -- he fought through that, and he survived it. I don't -- that -- you have to be pretty special. You're so cute! New area.
