In this film, G.T.I. are the initials... of the American company GARSON TEXAS INTERNATIONAL Hello, La Tribune. I'd like to speak to Mr Paul Kerjean, please. Who's calling? It's personal. Hold the line. You are connected to La Tribune, the weekly for news, art and literature. We have registered your call, please hold the line. Thank you. A THOUSAND BILLION DOLLARS The person you have called is busy, please hold. Thank you. The person you have called is busy. Thank you for calling. Please hold. Paul Kerjean. Who's calling? My name is of no importance. Stay there. Stay there while we talk. I'm too old to play Fantomas. Stop being smart, Kerjean. I have to be careful. You'll understand when I explain. I'm listening. What do you know about Jacques Benoit-Lambert? I thought you were giving me information. Don't annoy me, answer. Alright. He's elegant, rich, from a wealthy family, and a political superstar. Favourite sports: golf and swimming. Is that enough? If that's all you know, it's not much and it's not quite true. What's not true? You said he was from a wealthy family and rich. - His family's not wealthy? - It is. But he's not rich. Not anymore. He needs 750 million before the end of the year. He's a desperate man. You mean he's ruined? I said he needed 750 million, not that he hadn't found it. How did he find so much money? That will be the subject of our second meeting. I haven't had so much fun Since my 7th birthday party. Wait 5 minutes before leaving. I don't want to be followed. If I see you following me, it will be over. Why are you giving me this information? Because I adore you. Ba yen, are we still on good terms with the police? We get along fine, no more, no less. Why? Are you in trouble? No, not at all. I want the name and address of the owner of this car. I'll do the necessary. An accident? No. A mysterious informer. He arranged to meet in a parking lot to make some revelations. Revelations? About who? A big shot. A real big shot. MR ELECTRONICS Jacques Benoit-Lambert? Yes, JBL himself. He's unassailable. On all levels. Your informer is crazy. That's very possible. Jacques Benoit-Lambert France's Mr Electronics AN IMPOSSIBLE MISSION Economic recovery France Electronics I'll call you back. Hello, my little Arléne. How's your love life, your family, work, life in general? Sure you're alright, Paul? You're ingratitude personified. I just want to know how you are. Listen, kid, lovers are a thing of the past, I've no family and I'm sick of work! Do you know him? Yes. It's JBL. Tell me about him. Loves or lovers, of course. He's lived with the same woman for 5 years. She's called... Laura Weber. No photos. We've never caught them together. Apparently, she's in her thirties, beautiful, intelligent, single, Classy. Makes a change from his drunken wife! On the other hand, I've as many photos of her as you want. Officially, he's still married? Yes, but they're separated. She refuses to divorce him. At the last reception at the US Embassy she got drunk. He wanted her to leave, She got angry, made a scandal... Just another incident. Ah! Distinguishing feature: a huge personal fortune. It's the gentleman you were expecting, madam. Come in, sir. - What's your name again? - Paul Kerjean, madam. Thank you for receiving me. Sit there, so I can see you. No. There. You're hidden behind the flowers. Have a drink. Help yourself. You look charming, Mr Kerjean. It's very kind to come and see me. I'm so alone in this big house. No one bothers about me. Having no one to talk to is difficult, you know. I understand, madam. I imagine that you know that my husband and I... well, we've been separated for a while. My husband and I have been the subject of gossip recently. I'm aware of that, madam. No, no... I prefer to serve myself. Believe me, gossip isn't what interests my newspaper. Yes, I know. That's the reason I agreed to meet you. You're very charming, Mr Kerjean. You must know that my husband lives with a... a... Well... that sordid little adventure has surely nothing to do with... what you wanted to discuss. Nothing at all, madam. I'm writing about your husband, and I thought no one could know him better than you. Isn't that true? It certainly is. We married in October '41. During the war. He'd just finished his law studies. He joined the Free French Forces. I went to join him in London. But... we saw little of each other before the Liberation. And... After the war? Oh, yes. After the war. We went to live in the provinces, in Rouen. He had a law firm that was very successful. Then he stood for the parliamentary elections. He was elected. It was the start of his success. A total success thanks to his exceptional intelligence, uncontested skill and charm and professional competency. Although apparently, recently, he's had financial problems. That's no doubt jealous gossip. Has he had any financial problems recently? You should ask him that. I only know that he reduced my allowance. I have my own personal fortune, but it's not for everyday expenses. - Right? - Of course. When you were together, did your husband talk about his work? No. No. He took no interest in me. He just showed me off for photos. For the elections, for example. Or when he needed to take a wife to an official event. And... one day... one day, he... he left me alone forever. And there were his mysterious trips to see mysterious men. What trips? What men? I don't know. If I did, they wouldn't be mysterious, would they? Obviously, I didn't follow him. And these trips and mysterious men weren't called Miss Laura Weber? No. Not exclusively. How did you know? You didn't follow your husband. Your questions are becoming more and more personal. - Madam... - I didn't follow my husband! I didn't think for a moment that a woman of your Class and standing would sink so low as to follow her husband at night. I thought, maybe a private detective? In such a terrible situation, I would find that normal. - Really? - Definitely. I shouldn't reveal all my little secrets, but you're so nice, so understanding... I think it's time for you to leave. Good evening, sir. Please excuse me for not seeing you out. Forget everything I said. It was between you and me. WALTER AGENCY PRIVATE DETECTIVE Mr Walter, you were recommended by Mrs Benoit-Lambert. If I understand rightly, you followed her husband. At night, in particular. It's possible. She told me you took photographs. It's possible. Can you tell me when the photos were taken? I didn't say I took photos. I said it was possible. Of course. Someone else must have printed your name on the back of the photos. Listen, what do you want exactly? To see the photos. I hope you're joking. Not at all. I know your fees. I've prepared a cheque. You've already been paid for this. When were these photos taken? Over the last 2 months. I was in my car and used a zoom. Not bad, are they? On these negatives, JBL isn't with his mistress, but with strangers. Who are these men? I've no idea. Mrs Benoit-Lambert wanted evidence for her divorce. I wasn't interested in anything else, so I didn't develop them. So why did you take these photos? To prove to my client that I was working. Why? Do people wonder? Sometimes. Right... I'd like to borrow these negatives for 24 hours. I'll return them. Why? For my own album. That's not possible. I only give my photos to the Clients who hired me. The photos belong in the file. It's quite simple. I'm your client. I hired you to follow Mr Benoit-Lambert and to take photos. I'm delighted with your work. I paid. I'll take my file. That's perfect. Your request: 7702 NM 78 Sam BRONSKY Hello, sir. That car is not for sale. Hello, madam. Is Mr Bronsky here? I am Mrs Bronsky. Who are you? I'm Paul Kerjean. I'm a reporter. I've come about an investigation. I'm sure you've got the wrong address. I don't think so, madam. I'd like to see Mr Bronsky. Mrs Bronsky assured me that the car outside her house had not been used for several weeks. As for her husband, he lived in America. They'd divorced several years ago. Eric! The only Mr Bronsky I can introduce. - Hello, sir. - Hello. I didn't believe a word she said. But I left for the mysterious Mr Bronsky the number of a restaurant Where he could contact me. Hi! Alright? I'm fine. How's Bastien? He had a sore throat, but he's fine. You're having him on Saturday? Listen... at the moment... Can you keep him this weekend? I'm working on a big case. - A big scandal in View? - Yes. If all goes well. If all goes well for who? You, your readers, the scandal? Poor Jean, you spend your life looking for a Dreyfus Affair. But not everyone is as lucky as Zola. Running after Dreyfus, you encounter Mesrine. Héléne, don't start. Our marriage failed, let's make our divorce a success. - Telephone for Mr Kerjean. - Yes. Hello? - Paul Kerjean? - Yes. I thought I'd explained the rules to you. I've changed the rules. I refuse to be a puppet with you pulling the strings. We need to meet very soon if you want me to keep playing. Alright. I'll accept, this time. Be at Martin's in half an hour. At Pavilion Royal. Listen and do what I say. Sit facing the bar, with your back against the seat. Understand? Don't ever turn around While we're talking. Why did you want to meet? Keep it short. I will. I've had enough of this mystery, meetings at night and hidden faces. I don't know why, but you want my paper to bring down JBL. I won't publish an article Without real proof of your accusations. I want to know who you are, who I'm working with and your sources. If you won't accept, forget it. Kerjean, deep down, you know this is explosive but don't know how to handle it. You're annoyed because you're at a standstill. You can't handle this investigation. Find someone else, then. Goodbye! Listen, Kerjean, two weeks ago, I contacted you. What have you learned about Benoit-Lambert? He's respectable and respected, of unquestionable integrity, transparent bank accounts. Love life... acceptable. That's his public side. I said he was in dire straits financially. That he needed 750 million and had found it. Have you heard of SCOVIM? It's a real-estate company, headed by Benoit-Lambert's son-in-law. What's the link? SCOVIM built two 15-storey office towers. For 2 years, it's been impossible to rent or sell the offices. The banks have Closed the credit valves. They have to reimburse 750 million at the end of the year, but they can't. They'll declare bankruptcy. Suddenly. On the eve of bankruptcy, miraculous buyers will pay 1 billion, 750 million for the 2 buildings that can't be sold, saving SCOVIM and it'll make a nice profit as well. And? Are you doing this on purpose? That proves that the CEO of SCOVIM is remarkable and that Benoit-Lambert has the right son-in-law. The CEO of SCOVIM is not a remarkable man, he's a pretentious, incapable little technocrat. So the buyers help out SCOVIM and save it at the last minute. They don't give a damn about SCOVIM. They're using SCOVIM to get to Benoit-Lambert. In that hand, there was 1 billion, 750 million. That is not a purchase, it's a bribe. A bribe for what? I'm not the reporter. I've put you on the path, now investigate. No one pays almost 2 billion out of sheer kindness. Why not use legal means to denounce this affair? For a very simple reason. Benoit-Lambert has powerful friends. I don't want the affair to be covered up. If necessary, What is your direct number? How long have you been working on this, Kerjean? - 3 months. - Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to present something watertight, with proven facts, not accusations based on gossip. I don't like you investigating an explosive case without my consent. It only became explosive a few hours ago, Mr Hartmann. Before, I was at a dead end. What came up? I knew that a miraculous buyer had paid 1 billion, 750 million to save SCOVIM from bankruptcy. And, indirectly, Jacques Benoit-Lambert. This evening, I found out who was behind the buyer. The multinational G.T.I. And, of course, this revelation came from a reliable source. I can't say my sources are the best, but the information is indisputable. It all started in the most ordinary way. Benoit-Lambert and his mistress were followed by a private detective, hired by Mrs Benoit-Lambert. Classic photos, the vengeance of a jealous wife, who wants the divorce case to rule in her favour. But JBL goes out without his mistress. To meet other people. This man, for example. To justify his salary, the detective kept taking photos of no value for the divorce case. I obtained the negatives he hadn't developed. Our photo department has just developed them. Do you know this man? Yes. 3 months ago, you sent me to Brussels for the G.T.I. convention. Remember? That's right. We even joked about what time you were invited. It was 4 am. That's right. I arrived at the Hotel de la Cite at 4 in the morning, and I was met by this man. Fred Gritt. Delighted to welcome you, Mr Kerjean. Thank you for accepting our invitation. It's only normal. Since I have been head of public relations at G.T.I., you're the only reporter invited to our annual convention. I'm very flattered by this exceptional invitation, but... Why 4 am? It's only 9 pm for G.T.I. Our president travels a lot. On Monday he was in Hong Kong, Wednesday in Bombay, Thursday afternoon, in Moscow, Friday, he headed a meeting in New York, today, he's here. No human body can resist so much jet lag all year long. So the company decided to forego local times and everything is based on New York time. It is presently 9 pm in New York. Really? When he arrives somewhere, breakfast is eaten at suppertime and bedtime is at 3 pm. That's about right. It's a question of habit. Our watches are set to New York time. It's much easier when we have to call our headquarters. The president will speak in about 15 minutes'. It's always very brief. I will introduce you afterwards. Vittorio Horta. Michel Saint-Claude, G.T.I. Europe. What are you drinking, Mr Kerjean? I'm torn between a large whiskey or hot white coffee with a croissant. Here is the most important photo. JBL met - somewhere - the president of G.T.I. A formidable brain and a fearsome businessman. He managed to create patriotism for his company. That evening, at the convention, I heard his speech. His handshake was as cold as steel. But this handshake is worth 1 billion, 750 million. Everything came together, Jacques Benoit-Lambert has family and financial ties With the company SCOVIM which is in difficulty, but JBL is also the honest and uncompromising president of French Electronics. Unfortunately, you cannot receive almost 2 billion and remain uncompromising. Of course. You can't tell G.T.I. you'd like their millions but ask them not to interfere in your business. It's a little convenient to blame multinationals for all the economic problems in the world. Why are you smiling? Because that night, at the convention, the president of G.T.I. said exactly the same thing. So, Mr Kerjean, is your paper one of those who think that companies like G.T.I. are responsible for Europe's misfortunes? That's what economists say. They write complicated books, read only by other economists. That's as far as it goes. And you, Mr Kerjean, do you read those books? I've read some of them. I didn't understand everything, there are so many graphs, growth and investment Charts, market penetration. I recall three or four figures that fascinated me. Apparently, today, in the world, excluding the socialist countries, thirty companies, including yours, total an annual turnover of a thousand billion dollars. And? And such immense power in the hands of so few is frightening. A thousand billion dollars. It's one and a half times the GDP of France. A third of the wealth generated annually in the USA. A thousand billion dollars is... 10% of the wealth generated annually in the world, for a club of 30 people. Why are you complaining? 90% remains for the others. Not really, because if we increase the membership to 200 companies, you control 20% of world production, using only 0.5% of the population. Of course, you could retort that there remains 80% for the 4 billion people in the rest of the world. In the world in which we live, you must grow or die. We've decided to grow. - Any objection? - None. A small captain of industry, who probably agreed, once said: "When a multinational approaches your market, "you have 2 choices. "You sell out to them or you close down." He must have been depressed. It's current. Things will improve. It worked out well for him. He sold his company to G.T.I. He was a wise and smart man. He'll be able to holiday all yearlong. All his worries are ours now. Tell me, are you slightly communist on the edges? If I was a communist, it wouldn't be "on the edges". Would I be a reporter for La Tribune? True, but be careful what you say. Fred Gritt called me the next day, to make sure your article would be less violent than your words. And it was, dear Ba yen. That's true. Despite a "diplomatic incident", that was a close escape. I think it was the G.T.I. Manager for Belgium who came to my table and said: I think that this animosity towards multinationals is because European public opinion, especially in France, is deeply rooted in nationalism. They are not ready to accept the globalization of business, and they dislike foreign competition. Foreign competition is going to a country and saying: "Look, my product is better and cheaper than yours." That's what we do. No, you implant yourselves in the country, take over the company with the same product and impose your own product. You don't expect those people to welcome you with open arms? You are quite right. They only do that when we free them from the Nazis! That's what we call a cheap shot. Personally, I never thought for a second that you freed us from military occupation to replace it by an economic regime. Gentlemen, I think Mr Kerjean would agree that we've just made two very bad jokes. We promise that it won't happen again. That was when someone put something in my pocket. I never found out who. Undoubtedly the only person who liked me. On a paper napkin, he'd written 3 figures. Mind-boggling. Three figures concerning who or what? In 1968, an annual turnover of a thousand billion dollars required the 6,000 major companies in the world. In 1978, only 50 made the same amount. Today, there are 30. Tomorrow, 5 maybe. And even... one alone. On what terms did you leave? We separated in a perfect and mutual lack of understanding. I'll never forget the last impression I had of him. I've met quite a few visionaries in my life. Spiritual mystics, sects, revolutionaries, ideologists, terrorists, he is perhaps a mystic of profit. His eyes riveted on another planet, he raised his glass... To G.T.I. To you. As for me, in my will, I have asked for two dates to be engraved on my tomb. My dates of birth and death. That's normal. And in gold lettering, a single figure. The G.T.I. share price the day of my death. I want my successor to come to my grave once a year, and I will still be there, to check if they have made the share price rise. SCANDAL AND BRIBES It's launched. Go home and take the phone off the hook. You'll be plagued by radios, TV... Everyone will come calling. Certainly not. I'm leaving for 2 or 3 days. Where can we contact you? At the old man's. But only if it's urgent. - Back to your roots. - That's right. See you. Goodbye. Paul! It's great to see you again. - It's been at least... - Even longer! - Isn't the old man here? - He's in his office. - Hello, Michel. - Hello. Alright, Denis? Charles-Henri. We expected you on the 11 o'clock train. My dear Sylvestre, I came by aeroplane. An aeroplane. Young Paul, what are you doing with your arms in the air? Imitating an aeroplane. He could have said he'd come by plane. We'd have understood. He thinks we're idiots! He doesn't know yet. Tell him, Sylvestre. Well... Le Courrier de Vesons will be distributed in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse. Throughout the country. My little Paul! I'll give Germaine a call. So, in all the kiosks in France, no one will ask for La Tribune, Le Figaro or Le Matin, they'll say: "Le Courrier de Vesons, please." I've only two words for you: Well done! Hello. Germaine? Yes, he's just arrived. Have they delivered the turkey? Just as well. Tell him my stomach... FREE SPEECH Holidays for all ...foie gras for the New Year, fish on Fridays... The meaning of our folklore festivals it rained but it was a success!!! We came close to disaster. Don't add the mince until the onions are golden brown. Spread half of it over the turkey, and the rest... Cheerio. Go and get cleaned up. Everyone at mine in an hour. You should come back more often, Paul. Remember our argument? You wanted the headline: Paul Kerjean: I'll say "Yes, mayor, "but only to get married." You already liked catchy headlines. How are you getting along? We're getting divorced. And Bastien? I have him every weekend and for half the holidays. - I imagine there's no hope. - No. I've tried everything. Madam no longer wants to live in Paul Kerjean's shadow. She wants to exist. When we go out, the spotlight's on me. It's not my fault people want to talk about my latest article or book. I reply, that's all. And there's always a jerk who comes and says something like: "I find you so intelligent, madam." Just because she said: "Would you be so kind as to pass the salt?" "You're beautiful, you know." The supreme word is unleashed. Words. Words. That's what they want. The city makes you sick, Paul. Come on. Well done for your article. Very good, Mr Guérande, your article on business tax. And those bloody buildings they want to put up? In the next edition. Thank you, Julien. Admit you thought "Well done for your article" was for you. That's true. In Paris, you all think the world revolves around you. Here, they don't give a damn about your Parisian scandals. Maybe one day, you'll receive a letter saying: "The old man's dead". Tell yourself that I'll have left with the springtime, with a wealth of sights and sounds and a full stomach! I'll be buried here with your family, and on my tomb they'll write: "Here lies an old happy jerk". I'll make sure they write: "He talked of a faraway planet". Why? Talking about springtime was ridiculous? My springtimes are very simple, Paul. Springtime today is your visit and a stuffed turkey just how I like it. It's waiting for us. Germaine! What time was the body found? A mariner found it this morning at 6.15 am. There's no doubt, it's a suicide. Jacques Benoit-Lambert shot himself. We found this next to him, on the passenger seat. Mr Kerjean! Mr Ba yen's waiting in Mr Hartmann's office. Come in. Sit down. This suicide confirms your article, Kerjean. But I don't want us to act triumphant. We're not responsible, but if we continue, we'll annoy everyone. We can't persecute a man when some blame his death on us. - That's not my opinion. - Mine neither. But some think so. I think we should continue, Mr Hartmann. We can't allow ourselves to drop this as if we regret having lit a firecracker that exploded. We must see it through. Some questions are unanswered. Which questions? JBL couldn't sell off France Electronics alone. We must find the others, this could be far-reaching. The answer may be in these photos. Every other night, this is where JBL went. 16 rue Cisco. Walter, the private detective hired by Mrs Benoit-Lambert, took these photos. They couldn't be used for the divorce, so he stopped taking photos. He was probably going to see his mistress. No, sir, his mistress doesn't live there. There's this one, showing this man from behind. The only person I haven't identified. Listen, Kerjean, we can't imagine JBL using such means to survive. This man is dead, the rest is up to the law and history. For me, this is over. Thank you. - I've come to see Mr Walter. - Wait! Mr Walter is with someone. Mr Kerjean. Do me the pleasure of leaving immediately. I've nothing to say to you. I told you everything I knew the last time we met. I've nothing to add. Please leave. Listen, Kerjean, I don't have the time. I'm in a hurry. I have to leave immediately for a case. You can understand that, can't you? Come on, be kind. - Leave. - Just 10 minutes. 10 little minutes. - I don't have time. - Find it. Why? There's no reason. Yes, there is one. I'll write articles about private detectives, the Walter Agency in particular. You won't have to worry about your clients. You'll have a lot of spare time, to meet them for example. But... you're threatening me. I'm not threatening you. I'm giving you a choice. Alright. But only 10 minutes! Who did Benoit-Lambert visit, 16 rue Cisco? Who? I've no idea. Ground floor, a dental practice. First floor, a young couple with two children. They're always traveling. The husband teaches in the US 6 months a year. Mr and Mrs Chatillon. Second floor, insurance experts. Third floor, a retired couple, Mr and Mrs Holstein. That's all I know. Happy now? And this? That's Benoit-Lambert and Laura Weber. Walter, don't act stupid. This man here, who is it? I have no idea. I wasn't paid to follow him. My job concerned Benoit-Lambert and Laura Weber. That's all. For how long did you follow them? Almost until the last day. Why not until the end? Were you taken off the case? No. So why weren't you there until the end? I was. You were there... when he killed himself? Do you want my hide, Kerjean? I'm trying to find out what happened. So, the last evening, you saw JBL get into his car and you followed him. - No! - That's what you just told me! No. That's not what I said. That night, Benoit-Lambert left his home with two men. One got into the back seat with him, the other sat at the wheel. As I was about to follow them, a van drove by, blocking my view. When the van had passed, their car had disappeared. I'm warning you, this isn't in my report. I said I was sick that night and couldn't follow him. And that's what I'll say in court if the case gets that far. - On oath? - On oath. I wasn't there. I saw nothing. Who were the men? I've no idea and I don't want to know. What did they look like? Describe them to me. Not tall, not small, not too fat, not too thin, they were wearing shoes, trousers, and raincoats because it was raining. Is that enough? - Did you see their faces? - You want a photo? I didn't see anything. I was parked at a distance, it was nighttime. And now, for the love of God, leave, Kerjean. And to prove I won't hold this against you, I'll give you some friendly advice, drop this affair, forget Benoit-Lambert, go on holiday and leave this town. Very well. - That's all for now. - For now, or later. Don't call me, don't come back, I won't see you, I won't be here. - So, Bastien, you alright? - Yes. - Didn't Rémi come today? - No. MARITIME MUSEUM This boat's lovely, Daddy. What's it called? L'Océan. Come on. That's the Chebba. That's right. Wow! Bastien, go to the end of the gallery and come back the other way. - You're not coming? - I'll meet you there. - Miss Laura Weber? - Yes, sir. Thank you for agreeing to meet. I came because you said you were a Close friend of Jacques Benoit—Lambert. What is this about? I am not a friend of Jacques Benoit-Lambert. I needed to speak with you. Then who are you? My name is Paul Kerjean. Your brazenness revolts me, Mr Kerjean. Haven't you done enough harm? What do you want? To sully his private life? Go ahead. My name is Laura Weber. I loved him deeply. Miss! I understand your reaction. It's not about his private life. Please give me a few minutes and remain calm. Remain calm? You have no idea how much I despise you, sir. You're a monster. Between a crossword and a cartoon, you expose others' lives. You can't bear being less important than those you write about. Daddy! Don't leave. Look, it's Napoleon's ship. Shut up! - You can't shout in museums. - Why? Look and shut up. - I'm sorry. - It's disgusting. You even came with a kid, to soften me up. No one's trying to soften you up. You can be a reporter and a father taking his son to the museum. As for the rest, I just did my job. No, you were taking care of your career. You don't have the guts to admit it. You're not responsible for what happened, right? Miss Weber, it's possible that Jacques Benoit-Lambert didn't kill himself. He was killed? It appears possible. What makes you say that? A number of troubling facts. I can't talk about that for now. It may seem absurd, but I need your help. If you think I'll help you to write another article, you're crazy. Calm down. There won't be an article. Or if there is one, it will be to denounce his murderers. Anyway, I don't know how I can help you. I need to know if he led you to believe he was in danger. I talked about his death that afternoon. He told me he'd decided to fight back, that he'd bring to light a scandal that concerned a lot of people and I would be proud of having trusted him. Was that the last time you talked? No. He called me around 8:30 pm to say he was at his place but that he would come to mine, to tell me what he intended to do. He said: "I'll be at yours in half an hour." He was really happy. I waited for him. And who told you? No one. It's terrible to hear on TV that the man you love is dead, announced by someone for whom it's just another event like the weather and the rest. There, Mr Kerjean. You can continue shooting arrows Without wondering where they land. If you remember anything else, could you call me? It's highly unlikely that I'll call you, Mr Kerjean. Kerjean. JBL is dead. May he rest in peace. Forget the affair. Understand? Forget the affair. This is Ba yen. You haven't been in for 2 days. What the hell? Hartmann's asking about you. And I wonder if you still work here. Your presence here would reassure everybody, and would prevent you being fired for misconduct. Good evening. Paul, it's Héléne. I suppose you'll eat with Bastien. Please don't bring him back before 10:30 pm. I'm going out. Bastien! It's party time. We'll eat in a restaurant and then we'll watch a film. There. How about Bambi? - I've seen it twice. - Alright. A film with cowboys and fighting. Stop. Shane. The man from the lost valleys. - There's a little boy you'll like. - Does it end well? It depends for who. When I grow up, I want to be a doctor for children. Wait, it's called a... A podi... podiatrist. No, not a podiatrist, it's... - A pediatrician. - That's it. Apparently, it's a very good job. Come on, let's go. Daddy, can I take my bike to Mum's? Of course! Where's your restaurant? Daddy! OUT OF SERVICE Hello, the lift company? My address is 128 rue de la Convention. You sent your workers for the lift maintenance. They left half an hour ago, the ground-floor door is blocked and I've just heard a loud noise in the shaft. Yes, number 128. You didn't send anyone? Well, I'm not crazy. - You didn't get my message? - I did. I thought we'd agreed, once and for all... ...our relations would only concern Bastien. This does. Indirectly, but I'm here for Bastien. What's wrong, darling? What happened, Bastien? I broke my bike, Mummy. It doesn't matter. Here. I've a gift for you. You're crazy. You come over because of a bike. I'll explain the situation when your doc has left. Go and play in your room, sweetie. Can I know who told you? Kids of divorced parents are always torn between their father's job and their mother's lover's. I don't have the honor of being at the faculty, so it was easy. Leave,Paul Héléne... I'm really sorry to be a spoilsport, but I think the party's over. This is serious. Stop talking in riddles. Bastien and I were almost murdered. What's all this about murder. Someone tried to kill you? Yes. But why? What's it to do with Bastien? Nothing. They're using Bastien to get at me. Who's "they"? I don't know. My research isn't to the liking of everyone. The Benoit-Lambert affair? Yes. I don't understand. He killed himself. That proves it was true. I don't think he committed suicide. They used my article to disguise a killing as suicide. Why? So that he couldn't talk. He was about to. Do you know What he was going to say? Not at all. But... they don't know that. Héléne, you have to take Bastien away, for a while. I suppose there's no point in asking you to stop investigating. No, none at all. Alright. Tell me where to go. Thank you. I knew I was right to marry you. Hello. Mr Guérande? It's Paul Kerjean. No, not great, but I'll explain later. Mr Guérande, I need a favour. Can Héléne and Bastien stay at yours for a while? Yes. No. Let's call it an enforced holiday. Can you pick them up from the station? The evening train. Yes. Mr Guérande... Thank you. And give Germaine a big hug from me. Please forgive me, Pierre. I'll call you later. Héléne, you're sure there's nothing I can do? No, nothing. Don't worry. Thank you again. I'm sorry. I hope your guest didn't think my arrival was due to jealousy. Was it... very important for you? Nothing is more important than Bastien. Mr Kerjean. We don't see you very often. - What about your mail? - In a nutshell. This is the "insults" pile. To summarize: "Mr Kerjean, you chew people's lives up, "you talk about others, "coldly, without emotion, hiding behind your profession... "You stir up shit," etc, etc. And what is this? That's from a gentleman in the country, where toilet paper is quite rare, and this is how your article will end up. He added the famous words of Henri Jeanson: "I read you this morning, from behind." This is the "I loved your article" pile, "I greatly enjoyed it. Well done for being so brave. "It was extremely interesting," etc, etc. Nothing else? A young lady came to see you. Three times. She didn't want to give her name. - Is Bayen in his office? - Oh, yes. He's always in his office. Let's forget the niceties: "You're back, we don't see you often, "if you still work for us, let me know, etc." I'll get straight to the point. One: I was almost killed. They wanted to kill my son and me. Two: I'm now certain that Benoit—Lambert didn't kill himself, he was killed. Three: anyone looking into this is in danger. Four: I'm looking into it. Five: you'll cover me. Or I'll resign. "Cover you"? Not a word to Hartmann. Officially, you give me a story such as "The Cinema Crisis in France". I have something on that. We published that last year. It's still pertinent. Just change a few commas. I'll continue investigating, off the record. If there's a problem, you know nothing. Agreed? Come in. Mr Kerjean, she's here. Who? The woman who came three times. This may be my most stupid act, trusting someone like you... Miss Weber, only you can decide on that. I've no time to convince you I'm not who you think, that you can confide in me, etc. Either you talk to me or you leave. I've just been burgled. My apartment was searched from top to bottom, the carpets ripped up. - What did they steal? - Nothing. Nothing at all. It's not a burglary, then. They didn't find What they were looking for. Of course. But... do you think I should inform the police? What will you tell them? "I was burgled, nothing was stolen"? Now, tell me honestly, do you have any idea What they were looking for? None at all. Honestly. A piece of advice, you're not at risk, but leave Paris for a while. I'm going to my sister's in the country tomorrow. That's the best thing to do. Right. Thank you for trusting me. Miss Weber, one last question. Do you remember this man? You dined with him one night. Yes, of course. It's Michel Saint-Claude, Jacques' friend. What does he do? He's President of a big company in Europe, I think. Mr Kerjean, I see you're still interested in the G.T.I. empire. Don't you remember? We met 2 months ago at the Brussels convention. It was 4 am and we were pretending it was 9 pm. What are you drinking, Mr Kerjean? I'm torn between a large whiskey or hot White coffee with a croissant. I was charmed by you. Your arguments were naive, but full of good sense. You dared to stand up to the president. It was something to be seen. The napkin in my pocket, that was you. It was me. I took a risk. Have a seat. A whiskey? Mr Saint-Claude, were you close to Benoit-Lambert? Were you friends? We became friends. Gradually. I liked Jacques a lot. And I think he felt the same. Did you slip him notes too? Something like that. But it cost me my job. What happened? You know... to understand the workings of a multinational like G.T.I., you must attend one of their marathon conferences that start at 10 am and finish at midnight. Once a month, the president leaves New York in his Boeing with 40 of his closest employees. They fly to Brussels. There, on the 18th floor of the G.T.I. building, the branch mangers are put in the hot seat. It's a terrifying experience. A supernatural event. That morning, we were looking at the results of a branch, Texlico. The results were disappointing. The figures in the "real" column, the real annual figures, compared to the "forecast" column, the budget, clearly showed that the goals were not achieved. The accusing arrow showed that sales had dropped by 2.6%, despite almost 74 million dollars invested in research and development. Overheads had increased by 8.6%. Profits had dropped by 36 million dollars, 29.41% less than the objective. In such meetings, the monarch reigning over the company checks if his employees walk the line. He wants to see their faces when they present their accounts. Some managers were on the brink of fainting, others drank for 24 hours. I was a manager hardened by the years and I waited calmly for him to attack. We are only American with Americans. We've always known how to be European with the Europeans and French, of course, with the French. We are here to coordinate and make our subsidiaries profit from our international structure. Don't tire yourself out, Neil. The newspapers explain that well to the French. To them, we are a foreign company wanting to set up in France, to avoid the tax borders of the Common Market and to profit from the advantages reserved for French companies. What's a press campaign? Two days, one week. An event in Africa or the Middle East, an election in view and it's over. I talked about two main reasons earlier. The second is the president of French Electronics. Benoit-Lambert is stubborn. He won't capitulate. We have bought Benoit-Lambert. No. For now, you have only bought his son-in-law. We've bought a lousy company called SCOVIM, represented by the son-in-law and Benoit-Lambert. The son-in-law is worthless, so it's clear to everyone that if we paid 1.75 billion, it was for Benoit-Lambert. He's condemned to a certain reciprocity in the affair that interests us. If he makes a move... it'll be a scandal. He'll make a move. Mr Saint-Claude, to buy a man with power, three conditions are required. One: make sure he can be bought and pay the price. Two: guarantee absolute and total discretion. Three: eliminate any remorse by cunningly suggesting he is acting in his country's interest. They're usually very receptive to that kind of suggestion. We have respected the first two conditions. You've failed on the third. The people we buy know they're not acting in national interest. They pretend to believe it. Benoit-Lambert refuses to Cheat. There is a fourth condition that escaped you, sir. The meeting began with "My dear Michel", and ended with "Mr Saint-Claude". In G.T.I. language, that meant I was fired. How do you explain Benoit-Lambert's behaviour? He was given an enormous bribe by your company for a service he refused to render. I think he let us pay so that he could prove the scandal. I think your company outran him. They used me to destroy Benoit-Lambert's reputation and they got rid of him to prevent him from talking. You're getting ahead of yourself. The company was one step ahead of Benoit-Lambert for the scandal. But not to the point of killing. No. G.T.I. isn't the Mafia! Do you know this building? 16 rue Cisco. There's a dental practice on the ground floor. Doctor Riéra. On the first floor, the Chatillons. Second floor, an insurance expert, Robert Duroc. Third floor, Mr and Mrs Holstein. No, nothing rings a bell. Never mind. Thank you. Wait! I think there was a Holstein at G.T.I. He was manager of Austria. Around 1935. But there's probably no connection. Thank you. I'm Joachim Holstein. I was G.T.I.'s manager for Austria from 1930 to 1938. I don't see how I can help you. You knew Jacques Benoit-Lambert? I've read about him in the press, but I didn't know him personally. Mr Holstein, the man you claim not to know was photographed a dozen times entering this building. There's a dental practice and an insurance expert here, people come and go. The Chatillons have been away for 5 months, the dental practice closes at 7pm, the insurance company at 6pm. Each time, Mr Benoit-Lambert was photographed entering the building at 9 pm and leaving at midnight. Mr Kerjean, no doubt you've a good reason for solving this mystery, but I repeat that your problem has nothing to do with us. No one visits us but our son and daughter-in-law. Very well. In that case, I apologise for bothering you. Mr Holstein, I'm convinced you know something, but don't want to tell me. I've no way of proving my good faith, and you've no reason to believe me, but, you see, great things have often occurred because two men, face to face, looked at one another and seized that indefinable moment that is trust. Without reason, without logic. I think we missed that moment, Mr Holstein. That was a lovely speech, Mr Kerjean. But it concerns great men. I'm just a little man who will die soon. Mr Kerjean. Please come up, I'd like to tell you something. - My wife. - Hello, sir. Should I conclude that my indefinable moment was delayed? No. My eyesight is not good enough to spot a fleeting moment. I just suppose that if you were one of those who killed Jacques, you would not have left Without acting violently. I see that your brain is still alert. Nothing wrong there, thank you. Right, then. They killed him an hour too early. Jacques Benoit-Lambert came to collect an important file, they thought he already had it. - Who is "they"? - I've no idea. It's obviously those concerned by the file. I don't think so. Not directly. Have a seat. This file, Mr Kerjean, is the history, during Word War II, of a giant economic empire called G.T.I. I think this fragment of the past will explain the present. Sit next to me. New York Times, August 41933. For the first time, Adolf Hitler received a delegation of American businessmen at Berchtesgaden. Hitler received the president of G.T.I., Arnold C. Adams. Look. When questioned by the press after this meeting, Adams simply replied: "Gentlemen, all I can say is that Mr Adolf Hitler is impeccably dressed "and he is a true gentleman." The real reason for Adams meeting with the Nazis was discovered after the war, in 1946, during the interrogation of general 88 Kurt von Schroeder, who provided funding for the Gestapo. Kurt von Schroeder, from 1933 until war was declared, you presided the board of the American company G.T.I. Who appointed you? The president of G.T.I., Mr Arnold Adams. Developing G.T.I.'s business in Germany. Reorganizing the subsidiaries and signing new arms contracts. From 1933 to 1939, thanks to you, G.T.I. was given preferential treatment by the Nazis, as opposed to all other foreign companies who were expropriated. Why was the American company G.T.I. not nationalized? By nationalizing G.T.I., we would only gain a few factories. But by keeping these factories as German subsidiaries of G.T.I., we received all the American and international high-technology patents of which we were in great need. Rapidly, the balance sheets of G.T.I. Germany showed immense profits. How were these profits used? In 1934, I suggested to Mr Adams to transfer the profits to America. He said that he preferred to invest in other German arms companies. That's What I did. We built new factories with some of the profits, and invested the rest in 32% of the shares of Focke-Wulf. It should be pointed out that Focke-Wulf was the company that manufactured the German bombers. In your opinion, Mr Schroeder, Why did G.T.I. invest its profits in the Nazi war machine? It was obvious that G.T.I. and its president Adams believed in a German victory. Dr Gerhardt Kramer, you were the director of the G.T.I. factories in Germany and the occupied countries from 1933 until the end of the war. Yes. In 1938, after the Anschluss, Germany invaded Austria. G.T.I.'s factories were subject to the expropriation of foreign companies and the confiscation of their property. G.T.I.'s factories were spared once again. Why? Yes, I suggested that G.T.I.'s factories benefit from German nationality. In total agreement with President Adams? Yes, of course. G.T.I. became a German factory, and you fired the director, Joachim Holstein, because he was a Jew. I did not fire Joachim Holstein. We will hear his testimony. I was fired in 2 minutes. Arnold Adams came into my office. I looked him in the face. For the first time, he avoided eye contact. He said: "Dear Joachim, I'm so sorry about What's happening to you." What's to be done? It's not G.T.I.'s fault if the world is divided into two. By dealing with Hitler, I protect our shareholders' interests and prevent our subsidiaries from being nationalized. I'm sure we will meet again very soon. I never saw him again. Doctor Kramer, after the Americans entered WWII, in Germany, you continued to receive military equipment and raw materials from G.T.I.? Excuse me, was that a question? The answer is yes. This equipment was manufactured in the G.T.I. factory in Spain. They shipped it to us. What do you think of G.T.I.'s behaviour during the war? I think Mr Kurt von Schroeder can answer that better than me. May I remind you, sir, that we are not American, but German. Your question insinuates that G.T.I. betrayed its country. It served ours, and that was enough for us. Thus, German bombers manufactured in Focke-Wulf's factories with G. T. I. 's investments bombed the Allies' ships. G. T. I. also supplied the Allies with Huff-Duff radio direction finders to protect them from German submarines. But the position of the Allies' ships was relayed to the German submarines by cables installed by G. T. I. At that level, it's not business, it's surrealism. You can call President Adams What you like, but he was no poet. When he saw that Allied victory was inevitable, he changed sides. He put G.T.I. to work for the Allies alone. And in a colonel's uniform, he accompanied the victorious army through Western Europe to Germany, and oversaw in person the reopening of his factories. But... it's unbelievable. After the war, no one spoke out to... There were several. The Justice Department issued an indictment of heavy charges. The indictment is dated March 10, 1947. It was never signed and there was no trial. This is when it is no longer surreal, but Kafkaesque. In 1967, the American government paid 27 million dollars in compensation for war damages to G.T.I.'s factories in Germany, and 5 million dollars for Focke—Wulf's bomber factories, on the pretext that it was American property destroyed by Allied bombings. And President Adams was never indicted? Arnold Adams died in 1963. In his bed. He was awarded the highest American distinction, France made him Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour and Belgium made him Commander of the Order of Leopold. There. It took me 40 years to compile this dossier. There are all the patent numbers, and the plans supplied to both the Germans and the Allies. 750 testimonies. The minutes of every trial, G.T.I.'s accounts during the war, every bribe uncovered. Does anyone know you have this file? No one, because Benoit-Lambert is dead. It's for you. Read it carefully and you will find the key to the mystery. But beware of making hasty conclusions. Thank you for your trust. It's a poisoned chalice, you know. Before you take it, you must be aware that until this is made public, until it's published, you'll either be in danger... or a billionaire. Reasonably and logically, What do you think I'll do, Mr Holstein? You're hesitating? No. I'm looking. How did you put it? That indefinable moment that is trust, without reason, and logic. I guess I should put my hands in the air. Isn't that what you do in such situations? That's right. Go and sit over there. How shameful. For months, an organization of professionals has been trying to discover What Benoit-Lambert was up to. What bomb he wanted to explode. And it's an amateur, a little reporter, who discovers the truth. You can always say you discovered it, because... I imagine you'll get rid of me. Of course. Tell me your name. You owe me that. My name is Hankins. Stan Hankins. Whatever. A stupid question. Like your behaviour in this affair. Yes, I know. First, you used me to destroy JBL morally and make him suicidal. That was where my role ended. Exact. You wanted your role to continue, and you're not up to it. You'll disappear, having understood nothing. You're wrong. A few minutes ago, I put the pieces together. One: Why an economic empire like G.T.I. is hell-bent on acquiring the little French Electronics, when they have the same factories but better. Because the laws of its country prevent it from obtaining the huge market of a state, that I will call X. They look for a country who has no problem with the state X from where he could supply his client Without being bothered. The country is France, the factory already exists. French Electronics will be a cover. Two: the usual procedure of bribes is not enough, so G.T.I. tells its client X: "I can supply you, "but there is an obstacle I can't overcome." Three: the state X in question orders its secret services or a similar organization to remove the obstacle. And... a man, called Hankins for this mission, comes to France. And state X is... Second stupid question. What a shame. A piece is missing from my puzzle. We lost your trace 2 days ago, due to a technical error. No, I lost the men following me. Tell them that the building I entered had 2 exits. - Whatever. During those 2 days, you got your hands on this file. Who gave it to you? Ah, right. Now I understand why you weren't "expeditious" from the start. Stay where you are! Who gave you this file? May I ask you how your little sister is? That means you don't want to answer. There you go. I no longer have the monopoly of stupid questions. You're wrong, Mr Kerjean. We can negotiate. Negotiate what? Your life. In exchange for a name and an address. And the only guarantee you'll give me is your word. You're in no position to make demands. Having said that, think for a moment. You know that the man you name will be subject to some, let's say, unpleasant moments. You'll no longer represent a danger for us. You won't boast about exchanging your life for his. You know that if I disappear, I'm not alone. The newspaper and my team know about my investigation. They'll want to know what happened. We've thought about all that, Mr Kerjean. There's a little letter that explains everything. You're down, suffering from depression. You invented information, falsified documents. You never got over the part you played for Benoit-Lambert's death. You typed this on your own typewriter before killing yourself. That's right. Well? I won't be able to write it... I accept Give me some paper. I'll write it. Hello? Hello, Bayen, it's Paul Kerjean. The one time I go to bed early! Really! I tried to contact you all week. Where were you? Listen, it's urgent and I haven't got long, I have to leave Paris for a while. What's wrong? I've just killed a man. What! Who? Where? I haven't got time to explain. Tonight, I just want you to know I have an explosive dossier and the whole truth about the Benoit-Lambert affair. I need at least six pages in Monday's edition. Sort that out with Hartmann. When will your article be ready? If I can stay awake, I'll write it tonight. Then I'll accept everything. The police, a trial, judges, but first, the article. Where are you? Where can I call you? I'll call you. Good evening. Hello. Mr Guérande, it's Paul. Paul! We haven't heard from you... I couldn't call Without putting you at risk. - How is Bastien? - Fine. He's already in bed. Tell Helene I'm grateful for her patience and that she can return to Paris soon. How are you, Paul? Fine. I'm alright. Mr Guérande, I need one last favour. I'll be at the Sirene Hotel in Saint-Paul-le-Village at 2 am. It's about 30 kilometers from Vesons. - Exactly 35. - That's right. I need a typewriter, a lot of paper... Oh, no! I won't have the strength to type. Have you got a recorder? The little one you gave me last year. I'm ashamed, Paul, I've never used it. Perfect. Ask Sylvestre or someone from the paper to bring me that and 10 cassettes to the Siréne Hotel. Of course. Paul, what's going on? I'll tell you everything, Mr Guérande. Don't forget, the Siréne Hotel in Saint-Paul-le-Village. And a “We of coffee. Lots of coffee... Thank you. I'd like a room. How many nights? Three or four nights. Room 26, second floor. Room 17 wouldn't happen to be free? Yes, but it's a double. Do you mind? That's fine. Someone will bring me a parcel. Please tell... Someone's waiting for you. My poor Héléne, I've been a pain from start to finish. Paul, please! Why did you choose this hotel? I needed a godforsaken place far from Paris and not too close to you, to avoid trouble. What's going on, Paul? I'm going to spend the night on an article. A very long one. You can read all about it on Monday. Is that all you can tell me? Yes, because it's complicated and a very long story. - Are you expecting someone? - I hope not. - Room 17 is just a coincidence? - That's right. I'm staying with you tonight. - Listen, Héléne... - I'll keep out of your way. You won't even know I'm here. I'm not going to learn the news from the paper. Title in bold characters: A thousand billion dollars. My name is Paul Kerjean. I'm a special correspondent. It's a grand title because we go where the events take place, where men are fighting and die. Tonight, I survived the most pitiless war, the economic war, Where generals wear expensive striped suits and their weapon is a classy briefcase. Behind three discreet initials, a letter, dot, a letter, dot, a letter, dot, hides the biggest machine to crush borders, states, collective interests, with the simple goal of producing more, forever creating new markets and to sell! I was confronted with this challenge to the world. If the dynamics and globalization of business is in the nature of things, it is barely tolerable that it profits thirty companies in the world. States and their governments should control them, anticipate them, define them and dominate them... Given the absence of this policy or a lack of desire, these economic empires look down upon us, in all legality, from their summits. They look at us with our little flags, our borders, our big bombs, our patriotism, our ideologies, our quarrels and our folklore, while at the bottom of their annual balance sheets is written a thousand billion dollars. You know, room 17 wasn't a coincidence. Do you remember? Everything. Leaving after the ceremony, your delight in discovering Venice, the car breaking down 35 kilometers from Vesons, walking 3 kilometers to Saint-Paul, the Siréne Hotel, room 17, the blown lightbulb, unpacking, you laughing hysterically when I searched for you in the dark! You've finished typing it? Paul, what happened to us? One day, Mr Guérande told me that the city made us sick. - La Tribune? - I'm listening. Pierre Ba yen for Paul Kerjean. - This is Bayen. - Bayen... my article's finished. Where are you? It doesn't matter. You'll get it this morning. Tell me Where you are. Don't you trust me? I don't trust telephones. Did you talk to Hartmann? He'll publish it on Monday? Listen, Kerjean, I'm with Mr Hartmann. You're causing him problems. You must come and see him. I won't come back until my article's published. If Hartmann wants to speak to me, put him on the phone. Why do you refuse to come, Paul? As a precaution. Listen, you're tired, overworked, this investigation has exhausted you, you see danger everywhere, killers on your heels, murders. Believe me, you've nothing to fear. Come and see me. We'll talk calmly, and you'll see you've nothing to worry about. It's not true! You're treating me like a fool. I didn't talk about madness, but about working too hard. You explain that very well in the letter we found at yours on the typewriter. If you found that letter, you found the body of the man who came to kill me. Hello... Paul, we contacted the police, and they went to yours this morning. You see! There was no body in your living room, no blood, no mess. But they found your letter. His accomplices cleaned up! Yes, of course... Mr Hartmann, listen to me. I nearly died investigating, and until my article is published, I'm still in danger. I don't have time to explain, but I'm asking you to trust me. I have an explosive 700—page dossier that proves everything in my article. Bring me the dossier and your article. I will ask a calmer colleague to Check it out and I'll see what I can do. I won't publish your article on Monday. Alright. I'll give it to someone else. In your shoes, I wouldn't do that, Paul. Everyone will wonder Why we didn't publish it. They'll ask us, check your dossier and the result will be the same. Listen, bring us everything and go and rest, that's what you need. Tell me, Mr Hartmann, are you sure that LaTribune doesn't belong to G.T.I.? Your question is stupid and insulting! There you go. Héléne... I'm done for. They'll publish your article. Stop it, it's useless. You know them. They don't want to stick their necks out. Promise not to leave this room until I call you. That's all I ask. Héléne! Helene, you're going into the eye of the storm. Let me try, Paul, What's the risk? Don't move from here, I'll call you. Hello? Paul, it's Héléne. Are you crazy? You left at 9am, it's midnight. What happened? Your article will be in every kiosk in France on Monday. 400,000 copies. Don't tell me the name of the paper. Let me guess. 400,000 copies is... No, not at all. No. You're not even close. No. Don't wear yourself out, you'll never guess. Listen to something that will give you a clue... Le Courrier de Vesons. But you said 400,000 copies. Guérande used 14 months' worth of paper for one edition. For just your article, on 6 pages. Happy? Héléne, you're... You're wonderful! Poor Mr Guérande, he wanted to differ from the Parisian press. Germaine, you're in the way... Just listen to him! - Faster, Sylvestre, faster. - I can't go any faster. He's having a great time. Want to talk to him? No. I wouldn't really know what to say to him. He's got me out of a real mess. See you later, Paul. Hello... Don't hang up. Are you with someone? Who would I be with in this room? No, I mean... Is there anyone in your life? No. And with what's happened, if there was, they'd have given me the boot a long time ago. Perhaps you could stay with us for a while. Bastien would be so happy. Well, if it would make Bastien happy... I agree. What do you want to do afterwards? Paul, are you still there? Yes, I'm still here. I was thinking about What you asked me. Afterwards... well, afterwards, I think I'll try to join the human race. Come quickly! Subtitles: ECLAIR V&A
