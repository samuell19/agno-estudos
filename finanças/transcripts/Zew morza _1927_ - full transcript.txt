The Call of the Sea, directed by Henryka Szaro in 1927, was not well known by the general public. After the war only 2 copies were saved, both in very poor condition. One, a black and white copy with russian itertitles measuring 1040 meters in length was acquired in 1958 by the Russian film archive Gosfilmofond. The other copy, which has original Polish intertitles and is 1660 meters in length, was purchased by a private collector from Lodz in 1978 This restoration combines both copies for the final result. As part of the "preservation and digitization of pre-war feature films" project for the National Film Archive in Warsaw, both copies were subjected to restoration and scanning Then the material was digitally reconstructed: the image stabilised, the most obvious damage cleaned up, dirt and distortion removed and colour correction applied. Fragments preserved only in black and white were left in their original black an white. Intertitles only in Russian were translated into polish and marked with the logo of the National Film Archive Missing credits were reconstructed based on the original movie program. As the original film was not retained in its entirety it was not possible to restore the film to its original frame rate. The film has been adapted using current methods in an attempt to recreate the look of the original 16 frames per second. The new length of the fim is 2218 metres. Unfortunately, the movie is still not complete. This work was undertaken as part of the Project for the Conservation and Digitization of Pre-War Feature Films in the National Film Gallery in Warsaw. The project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund under the XI priority "Culture and Cultural Heritage" Infrastructure and Environment Program.

At the castle, the princess longed for her beloved. Prepare his chambers. The king is returning! Hello my Queen. I bring you gifts from our journey afar Here is an enchanted ring which will bring you eternal youth. He dreamed of traveling to faraway seas, exotic lands, having wild and fantastic adventures. Stach's parents leased an old mill on the Ostojski's land. Haneczka, the Ostojski's daughter, preferred eating sweet fruits than listening to the bitter remarks of the stern English woman, Miss Phillips. Stach's work on his ship was complete. So you really want to run away to sea? You don't want to play with me anymore? A captain of a ship has no time for fun. Tonight I'm running away to the sea! Won't you tell me what happened to the princess? That same night... The trade ship "Jola" returns from a long cruise. After many years Stach had become the captain's right hand man. Watchkeeping was Stach's favourite role. The helmsman, Karlsen, knew Stach from when he was a boy on the ship and as an experienced old sailor, often gave him advice. Dinner time. It's easier to climb the highest mast than to write a letter to your beloved. Stach was well liked. Only the boatswain Rudolf Minke, a brutish adventurer, hated him. Scrub the deck! Now! Calm down, boatswain! At the port. Van Loos, the ships owner had two weakenesses: Money... and his daughter Jole. Don't talk back, Loretto! Father, go to the harbour. It's arriving soon. The Ship? Yes...with him... The man she was not expecting. Please give me your hand in marriage! I love you! A ship hand! A ship hand! Ship hand! That cursed dandy, again! He mocks me in front of everyone... Humiliates me. If he takes my lady away from me I WILL KILL HIM! You know you like me, baby! You must be mine! Get out of here, you rogue! Get out of my sight! This isn't over between me and you! Stach worked day and night on his invention. I'm jealous of your projects. My invention will be a breakthrough in how we build ships! You said you needed a holiday? I agree. It's my decision that from today onwards, you are no longer employed by me. I would like you to be my partner... and my son-in-law! Meanwhile, Stach's family. Stach's father, the mill's tenant. My dearest parents. I will visit you soon... I'm engaged to my employer's daughter... A few days later. In the Ostojski's house. Karol, happily hoping for Hanka's hand in marriage, busies himself at the manor. Love will not let him sleep. Schedule for July the 12th - Exercise. Feed the fish. Horse riding with Hanka. The neighbourhood's cordless telegraph. Supposedly, my lady, the miller's son has returned! 1 0-30... Horse riding with Hanka. It would please me to show you our beautiful old mill. It is said your son has returned? Don't you recognise our young lady? So you have stumbled back to our family village? How do you like our mill? Not nearly as much as I like its lovely owner There are times when it is hard to write letters. Dear Jola! I will go to pay the rent. I'll come with you, father! So... you really did become a sailor? Today was not Karol's day. I wonder if you could tell me where I can find Hanka? So now you will marry the Captain's daughter and... I guess that's the end of this romantic story? I'm indebted to Captain van Loos. He looked after me, like his own son. Your heart beats under your scarf, plum, plum, plum, plum. Hanka is my only love, plum, plum, plum, plum. After waiting a long time, Jola finally receives a letter from Stach. I'm sorry I haven't returned. I have to stay for longer than I thought. Some important matters have come up. "Important matters"... Hanka's birthday celebrations at the manor. Despite many set-backs, Karol still longed to win his marriage. Stach was invited to the party too. I need to tell you something very important. You look like a dream. I need to tell you something very important. You look like a dream. An uninvited guest... You look like a dream A shooting star. What wish did you make? I wished for a happiness of the sort a man finds only once in a lifetime. My father wants me to marry Karol. He's very rich and we... That can't happen! I will go to your father immediately and propose our marriage. No, no... I'll talk to my father alone. They say sailors can read the stars. Do you know what Virgo says right now? Right now it's easier to see Aries. Do not throw dust in my eyes... I'm giving you money only because of the arrangement to marry your daughter, and I will not wait any longer! You'll get what you paid for. I promise. Please tell Mr. Skarski that I accept the marriage proposal. Don't worry, father... Mother will not find out about this. We must buy our servants new clothes! Franciszek has a patch on his elbow! I almost blushed red from shame! Karol asked me for my hand. I accepted. I might not yet be married to Hanka... She's better off for it! Karol, can you please bring me my fan. Whatever happens... I only love you... It is my honor to announce the engagement of my daughter to Mr. Karol Skarski. After the guests left... Stach wanders desparingly through the garden. Hanka, why did you only pretend to love me? Don't overwhelm me. I'm so unhappy! So this gold-mine got the better of me! Tell me, Hanka... Are you happy? Yes, mom. Very happy. Mother... I have to go... The sea calls for me. It is more faithful than any woman. Go, my son... God will lead you! Steal his plans and nothing will stop you! Minke did not scoff at stealing the plans. More than just being good business, it was a chance to get revenge on Stach. Torpedo shooting. I can't forget about her. Stach did not know that he was not forgotten either, memories by the pond like ghosts. Meanwhile, there were significant changes around the manor. Ostojski's finances had improved. The marriage to Karol had not happened and Hanka searched the seas, longing to find Stach. You saw the van Loos ship in Gdansk port? Stach went to Gdansk to turn down van Loos' offer. I now serve in the Polish Navy. Jola, I will always love you like a brother. I understand... You love someone else. I came for my plans. Karlsen, the helmsman, is dying. He wants to see you. Please keep in contact... He took the plans with him?! You must get them! I'm waiting for them! Karlsen was in great health. You sit at home, old man, while we're in the port looking for you... Hanka's research had lead her to the house of van Loos. Is this where I will find Mr. Stanislaw? He's currently serving the Polish Navy in Gdynia. And with whom do I have the pleasure of speaking to? I'm... I'm his fiance. Karlsen?! I was told that you are dying!? Stach was here to take his plans for his invention. A man called him to see you. PLANS?!... I have a bad feeling! You stole from me! I pray he will be taken from you too! Let's finish this now! HURRY! HIT THE GAS! Waiting impatiently on the boat. TO GDYNIA! HURRY! A witness to Stach's kidnapping. The steamboat's waiting. We must board it as soon as possible! Hanka decides to alert the Polish authorities in Gdynia. The commander in chief of the Navy. A hydroplane is ordered to find the boat. The fleet signals from the command station. Prepare the torpedo ship 'Kujawiak' to go out to sea! Report: Ship ready. Alarm to lift the anchor. We need to get to the steamboat quickly! Shh.... It's me, the watchman! This is the position of the wanted boat FULL STEAM AHEAD! They're chasing us, boys! They can't find the officer here! Put him in a sack and throw him into the water! We agreed to smuggle him, not to murder him! Crossing the navy is serious. It's not a joke! Raise the sails! Quickly! Bow cannon - fire a warning shot! FIRE! Stop immediately! Drop your sails! We have to surrender or they will rupture our ship and we'll be mayonaise for the fish! Target the fishing boat! When the mysterious sack sank in the sea, Hanka knew that they were too late. Drop your sails! We surrender! Stop shooting! Prepare the boat! He obediently reports that these men wanted to kill the lieutenant, but I... ... and then they threw the villainous Minke to the bottom of the sea! It's all still here in the briefcase, Lieutenant! Thank you, captain! If it weren't for you gentlemen... We aren't the only ones to thank, but also... Hanka, you're here? You were brought here by the call of the sea, and me... the call of my heart.
