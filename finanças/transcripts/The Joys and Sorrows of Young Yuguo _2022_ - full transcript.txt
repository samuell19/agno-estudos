[WIND WHOOSHING] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [BOY IN CHINESE] I want to become rain, scouring the roof I want to become a wave And take away the past I want to become fire, burn and purify But if I can, I want to be myself [GENTLE MUSIC CONTINUES] [BOY IN ENGLISH] I'm about to introduce myself. My name is Yin Yuguo. I'm 16 years old. Born and raised in Kunming, China. [WIND WHOOSHES] I often dream I'm a dragon. I can go anywhere. See the world. Find my true home. [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC CONTINUES FAINTLY] I really like communicating with people in English. I enjoy expanding my vocabulary. That's why I write here to you all. I love literature deeply, and most books I read are by Central and Eastern European authors. [SIPS DRINK] I'm in grade ten in high school, and I feel like a dragon flapping its wings in a dark dungeon. I love poetry books, especially Eastern European Romantics. But most people call those "useless books" because they can't help you with exams. [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] A well-known Polish poetess said, "I prefer the absurdity of writing poetry to the absurdity of not writing poetry." Well, I prefer the absurdity of reading poetry. [IN CHINESE] Forest, why are you so troubled? There's no wind and there's no rain Yet your branches are in pain Yes, I'm troubled, you know why? Because the summer's almost over And my leaves are quickly falling [WOMAN IN CHINESE] I'd call my son "the carer of the stars," like he could only talk to the universe. [BIRDS TWEETING] There's no one on earth that could understand him. [BIRD SQUAWKS] He had this special loneliness. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRD SQUAWKS] As if he was breathing, but nobody else could hear his existence. My heart ached because the only thing I could do was let him cry in my arms. I'd hold him in my arms and pat his back. [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] My parents love me so much and understand me, but if I can't study abroad, life can't carry on. [RECORDER CHIMES] [IN CHINESE] I hope for four things. The first is to be able to continue to enrich myself intellectually. The second is to be able to take pleasure in all kinds of creative endeavors, like literature and art. The third is to carry out my own creative activities and contribute to the arts and cultures of the world. And the fourth one is to find true love in a new society. [RECORDER CHIMES] [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] Dear Romanian National Ministry of Education, I'm writing this letter to explain why I dream to study in Romania. Dear sir or madam of the University of Bacău. Salutations. I am a Chinese senior high school student, and I am fond of Romanian culture, especially Mihai Eminescu. [MAN IN ROMANIAN] Yuguo's email inquiring about the possibility of studying in Romania was in my inbox when I arrived at work. [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] My dream is to come to Romania, the country of literature in my heart, to learn Romanian and become a real literary worker. [APĂVĂLOAEI IN ROMANIAN] Of all the emails I get from young people who want to study in Romania, none say, "I'm in love with Romania." So, I replied immediately, as he was the student I'd always hoped for. [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] I always knew I was a Carpathian dragon. Isn't this such a wonderful coincidence that my university is right at the foot of Carpathian Mountains? [WIND WHOOSHING] [DRAGON ROARING] [ITEMS CLANKING] [QING IN CHINESE] He was going to be a student in Romania. How to protect him? We hadn't given him any constraints. He was going to live freely, but I still wanted to protect him under the wings of the old hen. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] I took a picture of him as we left for the airport. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] I didn't want to be corny or sentimental, but I was afraid of missing him too much. [YONGLIN] Going abroad to Romania to study, this was his wish, which was a good thing. So even though in my heart I didn't want him to go so far, I wasn't going to stop him. [QING] I felt him watching me in the side mirror, looking at me with a smile, but I had to grit my teeth and carefully mask my heartbreak. [GENTLE MUSIC CONTINUES] [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] My biggest adventure so far. It's time to leave for a new cave A higher one, wider And with light that is brighter On the way, the weather may snow And the winds may heavily blow But since what is calling, I know I must go [TRAIN BRAKES SCREECHING] [APĂVĂLOAEI IN ROMANIAN] I think he was surprised to arrive in a town of only 200,000 people like Bacău. People don't come here. This is not Bucharest or one of the big cities. You're either just passing through or something's wrong. [YUGUO IN CHINESE] Hi, Mother! This is it. Vasile Alecsandri University in Bacău. Look at the old building. This is Eminescu, of course. This is Mr. Adrian. You know him already. He always helps me. This is my class. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] And this is Ms. Drugă. She teaches Romanian grammar. [SPEAKS ROMANIAN] [YUGUO IN CHINESE] And the amazing Mr. Dănilă. [IN ROMANIAN] This was my first contact with a Chinese person. No foreigners come here just to study Romanian culture and language. Or at least not in our university. I'd heard he was at the university. And I saw a young man. Tall. What always amazed me was the way he dressed. Always wearing a white shirt. [APĂVĂLOAEI] Buttoned all the way up. [SAVIN] Impeccably ironed. He would wipe the blackboard, although I was used to doing it myself. He always offered to carry my laptop. I'd say, "Don't worry, I can handle it." "No, teacher." [SPEAKING ROMANIAN] I actually asked him, I said, "Sorry to ask, how many million inhabitants does the city you come from have?" And when he said it's five times bigger than Bucharest, I asked, "So why did you come to Bacău? To Romania?" [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] I like the city of Bacău. On the weekends, I enjoy going to sleep right before the sunrise and getting up in the mild sunshine of Romanian afternoon. Wearing a tie, sleepy eyes. Trying to end the rise of tiredness with a cup of coffee. But I must practice more. [YUGUO IN ROMANIAN] What I wish for you, sweet Romania What I wish for you, sweet Romania What I wish for you, sweet Romania Of all Eminescu's poems, he was most attached to that anthem, let's call it that, "What I Wish for You, Sweet Romania." [YUGUO] My country of glory The country I long for [SAVIN] He asked me to listen to him recite it. He recited it twice, and then he insisted on hearing me recite. [YUGUO] May you have a future As great as your past! Sweet Romania, this I wish for you [WOMAN] We hosted the National Day of Culture at the Alfa Gallery in Bacău, and that's when Yuguo appeared. [MAN] A young Chinese man came down the alley. He stopped in front of the gallery and said, "Good day!" in Romanian. What was he up to? We were amused by him. I captured this, which was very comical. With the Astrakhan hat, a traditional Romanian hat. [BĂCĂOANU] ...to celebrate not just our national poet, Mihai Eminescu, but Romanian culture as a whole. People were quite apathetic. It was a dull event. We were there just to show face. Halfway through the event... Good day! [ALL APPLAUDING] Today, I have Eminescu's "What I Wish For You, Sweet Romania." [BĂCĂOANU] The audience was fascinated. The room went quiet. What is this boy doing here? How come he can speak Romanian? You could read the awe on people's faces because of how well he spoke the language. What I wish for you, sweet Romania My country of glory The country I long for? [UNGUREANU] Now laugh, if you can. When we first saw him, we laughed like idiots. But he wowed everyone. Like the night's stars Like the day's dawn May you live forever Full of glory and joy [DĂNILĂ] I was watching him, listening to him, and I was convinced I'm in the presence of an extraordinary being. [ALL APPLAUDING] [SPEAKS ROMANIAN] Um, and now, in Chinese. [IN CHINESE] What I wish for you, sweet Romania... [BONTA IN ROMANIAN] That's exactly what the event needed, a young Chinese man coming out of nowhere to recite Eminescu. He seemed to fit in. He was looking for his place amongst Romanians and in our culture. But we also needed someone like him! To discover us, the way that Yuguo did. [IN CHINESE] Sweet Romania, this I wish for you [ALL APPLAUDING] [IN ROMANIAN] Thank you! [BIRDS TWEETING] [BĂCĂOANU] He said he was the only son of a family of university teachers. I thought it was amazing that he was allowed by his family to travel so far at such a young age. [COUGHS] [QING IN CHINESE] Although he was far from us, he was accomplishing his mission. He was so happy to share his daily discoveries and happiness with us. [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] If you have the opportunity to observe a crow carefully, you will find that the crow's feathers and posture are extremely beautiful. Crows are rarely seen in my hometown. White, the winter White, the winter Clouds hanging high in the sky Foggy the sight, foggy the sight Merciless as the dragon's flame [MAN 1 IN ROMANIAN] He hadn't seen snow before. He was very happy. When it snowed late at night, he'd come outside. [WOMAN] He wanted to absorb everything! Atmosphere, nature, buildings, trees, birds. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS TWEETING] I'm often disappointed... by Romania, but he saw it with completely different eyes and showed me that Romania is really beautiful. [MAN 2] He started coming to our museum, and he was more serious than any of us! We tried to talk to him in English, but he only wanted to hear Romanian. He'd come here to learn our language. He wanted to know everything. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BERNEVIC] He seemed like from a different era. He was delicate on the inside. That's what I felt. That he was... pure. He was searching for something with so much thirst and with so much intensity. [ANNOUNCER] Esteemed travelers, train 554 is... [BĂCĂOANU] He really wanted to go to Alba Iulia. The journey to Alba Iulia is hellish. I don't know many people in Bacău who would just grab a flag and take the train to Alba Iulia on the 1st of December when it's so cold. [YUGUO] ♪ Wake up, Romanian ♪ ♪ From the sleep of death ♪ [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY] [QING IN CHINESE] He called us. He was very excited. He couldn't sleep that night. He sang the Romanian anthem all the way to Alba Iulia on the train journey. He said, "Mom, I'll take part in a big parade." "I'll be with everyone, in the middle of the crowd!" [ALL CHANTING IN ROMANIAN] [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] This year, all of Romania is headed to Alba Iulia for the hundredth anniversary of the unification. I was fortunate to participate in and document the celebrations. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL CHANTING IN ROMANIAN] Long live great Romania! [MAN] I met Yuguo at Alba Iulia. He was wearing more Romanian flags than any of us. He was so emotional and happy and said, "We're going to celebrate together!" [INDISTINCT CHANTING] [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] I'm not worried about being lonely anymore. The people here have shown me the greatest warmth. They help me and trust me, even when I haven't done anything practical to their country, just showing my love to their nation. Yes? [WOMAN] Why did you come here today? I love Romanian culture and literature. Today, I'm here to celebrate with everyone. Happy birthday, Romania. I wish Romania and the Romanian people will have a great future. - [WOMAN] Where are you from? - China. Yes. [IN ROMANIAN] For someone to come from such a faraway place and talk so beautifully and simply about you... I don't know. That never happens. [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] People invited me to have traditional Romanian food. They all chatted with me and regarded me as a friend. - [CROWD CHEERING] - [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] I was so happy that night. [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] [DĂNILĂ IN ROMANIAN] Here it is. His first published article. "1st of December, Alba Iulia" by Yin Yuguo. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [YUGUO IN ENGLISH] When I'm happy, I like to go to the park. The sovereignty of the main park in Bacău belongs to the crows. The sound of flapping wings is endless. - [WINGS FLAPPING] - [SQUAWKING] [DRAGON EXHALES] I feel like the dragon finally found his home. I still have a lot to explore, a lot to see and discover. But I have a lot of time and all my energy, which is limitless. [TRAIN CHUGGING] [IN ROMANIAN] I met young Yin Yuguo on January 4th, 2019. He came to visit the museum, and at the end of the guided tour, he wanted to write something in the visitor book. And because he was so tall, he knelt down. It was an extraordinary moment. It was like a prayer for the history of the place, so I asked if I could take a photo. [PENCIL WRITING] Later on, that photograph, unfortunately, became the one by which the police identified him after the tragedy that took place. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] On Friday night, he told me he wanted to go visit Neamt Fortress. I asked him not to go. There were weather warnings. [DĂNILĂ] But he decided to go. He took the train. And in a station along the way, the train was stationary for a bit longer than usual. Without any means of information, Yuguo panicked. He thought that's where he was supposed to get off. He decided to jump as the train was leaving. He opened the door and saw a sea of snow, without knowing that underneath the snow, there was a stone mile marker, which he hit his head on. The end was instantaneous. [WIND WHOOSHING] [QING SPEAKING CHINESE] [YOUNG YUGUO SPEAKS CHINESE] [QING SPEAKING CHINESE] [QING] I remember you were playing in the bathtub when you were small. The water splashed everywhere, and the whole room was filled with your laughter. You said, "I think the nature of the universe is ashes." "The Earth is the ashes of the Sun. The Sun is the ashes of the galaxy." "Everything is ashes." [YUGUO SPEAKING CHINESE] [QING] You were five. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [QING SPEAKING CHINESE] [YELLS] [QING SPEAKS CHINESE] [SHOES THUDDING] [YONGLIN] I lost the ability to smile. If there is indeed a parallel universe, I hope he's there, pursuing his dreams. I hope he's healthy and happy in that world, living the life he wants. [GENTLE MUSIC CONTINUES] I must learn to be strong. [QING] Many asked us if we regret letting him go. We don't. We don't have regrets. The biggest wish parents have is to see their child realize their dreams. If we are afraid to follow our dreams, then we can't have anything. Bacău is his home. Because it's in the Carpathian Mountains. Because he spent 80 incredibly happy days there. [GENTLE MUSIC CONTINUES] [INAUDIBLE] He said, "Mom, I dreamt I was a dragon, flying in the sky." "But I died. My heart was stabbed." "I fell from the sky, and my flesh was given to many people." He told me the dream made him happy. - [WIND WHOOSHING] - [TREES RUSTLING] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [INSPIRING MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADES OUT]
