Look out! There's another bottle coming. Look Out! Look at that! Come on, let's throw another one. Look out below! Here goes. Don't do that. Oh, come on. Hey, Bill wait a minute. That's my best brush. I'm sorry. Here, use this. You haven't a witch broom, have you? Have a duster? No, I haven't. How do you like that landscape? Fine. I couldn't do better myself. Billy, hurry up, when are you going to get through with this? Quiet! If you ever think of subleasing this studio remember I'm a subleaser. There's art here. Oh, yeah. Hey, wait a minute! Why did you do that for? Well, he was making faces at me. That's too bad. That happens to be my father. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Call for Jerry Strong. Call for Jerry Strong. Call for Jerry Strong. Call for Jerry Strong. Hey, what's the idea? Do you think you're being a very good host? Perfect host. Don't interfere with anybody. Come on, dearie. Don't be an undertaker. I've got a headache. Right, we'll mix you something. Blow your headache away. No, thanks. You run along and play. You're not mad because I borrowed the studio, are you? Certainly not. Miss Collins, please. Oh, there you are. There's a painting to be done. And a shampoo, Billy. I'll give it to you myself. What is is going to be? Still life? I hate still life, Bill. Put some action in it. She doesn't like still life. What's it going to be? Come on tell me. What do you want? Washington crossing the Delaware. He wants Washington crossing the Delaware. I haven't got room for that. Well make room. Go on. That's the artist's privilege. Say, what did you and Jerry do? Have a lovers' quarrel? Lovers? Don't be silly, Billy. We're engaged to be married. Doesn't he like your shindig? He doesn't approve of me. He says I'm an orchid and wants to change me into a lily. There ain't no more lilies. You should tell Jerry that sometimes, Bill. He'll find that out after he's married. Oh, you... Stop wiggling, I have business to do here... Ouch! You're tickling me. Can I do anything for you? Yeah, you can look the other way. You'll lose that boat if you don't watch out. That's great. I wanna lose it. It ain't mine. Is there anything I can do for you? Yeah. Got a cigarette? Say, you don't happen to belong to that gang out there in that boat, do you? No. I don't even like those fellas. Why? Never mind. Say. How far is it to town? What town? There's only one town. It's about 30 miles from New York. I ought to make it by Tuesday. Cheerio. I'm going that way. Won't you let me give you a lift? Angel. I'll remember you to my dying day. Gee, that's great. How come you're riding around 4 a.m. all by yourself? Well, to tell the truth I ducked out on a party. That makes you and me cousins. I mean, it is embarrassing. Serves you right for going to that kind of a party. If you're gonna preach I'll walk. I'm sorry. You're cold, aren't you? Cold? I'm freezing. I blew that cattle boat in such a hurry I left my wrap. Oh, gee, that feels good. Oh, boy. Hey, you don't have to tote a flash, do you? You know, for our sake as nearly injured. No, I haven't got a flash. Oh, well. You can't have everything. I suppose you're wondering what I was doing at that party. Well, brother, that's my racket. I'm a party girl. You know what that is? I never go to parties. Aw, it's too bad. Well, in case you ever do, and you need a girl, I'm the one you call for. I'm the filler in. Do you mind giving me a cigarette out of that pocket? Sure. And for taking me home, I'll even light it for you. There. Thanks. Lovely night, isn't it? Look, can you do this? Easy. Gee, you can smile, can't you? Say, can I use your shoulder for a while? Alright. And I know all the answers about running out of gas too. Yeah, go on, I'm listening. Imagine it. For 30 miles we ride together in his car and never once did he so much as make a pass at me. I even fell asleep and he kept right on driving. How did you know? I'm a light sleeper. It was at Yonkers I woke up. What a place to wake up. And then what happened? Almost before I could get the sleep out of my eyes he propositions me. He said he was an artist and wanted me to pose for him. What's he look like? He's tall, and good-looking, and young. Oh, boy, has he got flare. Ask if he's got a boyfriend, will you? Hello? Oh, hello Mr. Quinlan. Aw, Mr. Quinlan. Well, I might. Hey, Dot. If it's on a boat, lay off. It ain't on a boat, is it? An office building? Oh, that's ok. A friend? I can't. My girlfriend went to another party. Yeah. What's the address? I've got it. Alright. Make him send a car, foolish. Oh, yoohoo, yoohoo. Listen, I forgot. You have to send a car. Yeah. Alright. I'll be ready. Goodbye, darling. What kind of a sap is that guy? He's one of those fellas that even his best friends don't tell him. Give me a puff, will you? Why don't you come along? I'd hate to go alone. I'm through with that chicken feed. You're talking to a lady that's going to have her picture painted. Yeah? And you're talking to a lady that's going to eat caviar. Well, don't eat too much just 'cause it's free. Another ten pounds and he won't be calling you up anymore. Listen to this: you can't weigh sex appeal. Empty beer bottles, empty whiskey bottles. Empty wine bottles Cigarette and cigar butts. cars get smashed, walls stained. A studio? That place looks like a nightclub. It wasn't my crowd, in fact it wasn't my party. Whose party was it? Oh, a friend of mine borrowed the studio. Just as I thought. You surrounded yourself with a a lot of half-baked, long-haired... No, Governor. Everybody at that party had a hair cut, even the women. You bet they did. He-women and she-men. I know 'em. Sponges. Hanging on for what they can get out of you. They're not our crowd. Those are not our people. John, dear. Let the boy alone. You promised. I know I did. He's going to get married soon. Not fair to Claire. To think of my only son wasting his time on a... on a... Career is the word, Dad. Career? You call daubing a career? Daubing? Why, John, Jerry has created a couple of beautiful things. Well, I've created a couple of beautiful railroads too. And who's going to take charge of it when I'm gone? A painter? If you stepped out tonight, they'd run themselves. That's how good a job you've done. Why, John, if Jerry were to give up his painting I'd never forgive him. And if you don't stop pegging him I'll never forgive you. What chance have I got with you two? I wish Claire was here to help me out. John... You darn old pudding... Who's the head of this family? As for you, I'm going on record that that art business is going to get you in a beautiful jam. I'd feel homesick if I didn't hear a little of that grumbling. What do you mean by that, Jerry? It's rather a beautiful word, isn't it? More than that. It's a beautiful thing. I wonder if I could put it on canvas. Have you found a subject? Last night I think I found one. A strange sort of girl. She had a mask on like everybody else. But underneath I think she had this. Alright, chin up, Miss Arnold. Now look up. Up. Up, I say. How high is up? Am I looking up? You are not. Only your eyes are looking up. Now... What do you see? A ceiling. That's just the trouble. Look through the ceiling. Visualize. The sky. Space. The universe. Stardust, anything. There is no ceiling. Don't you see? Horse feathers. It's a ceiling. You can ask anybody. Listen, big boy. Why don't you make up your mind? You hired me to pose for you and then you don't even know what kind of a pose you want. I don't want any pose. I want to paint you. And while you work for me you better let me do all the painting. What do you mean? See, look at that. Hey, what's the idea? I can't paint you unless I can see you. And I can't see you with all this camouflage. You want me to be homely? I want you to be yourself. Then what the devil are you trying to change me for? I'm not trying to change you, I'm trying to paint you. Now, there. That's the position. Well, I'm warning you. For being a model, $2 an hour is okay. But for being an experiment, the sky is the limit. The ceiling seems to be your limit. Goody, goody, goody. Let's fight. Quit the clowning and let's get to work. Please hold still just a minute. How do you do, Miss Collins? Hello, George. The roof for Miss Collins. Yes. Billy, have you seen Jerry's new model? No, and I'm only calling on him for engaging a model without my approval. Be careful when you stop this car. I'm a little weak in the hoses, you know. Yes, sir. Anything else you don't like about me? Since you ask, if you ask, plenty. I don't like these clothes you're wearing. What do I wear, bathing suits? I don't look so bad in a bathing suit. I daresay. Well I'm not interested. I want you to wear something simple when you come up here. A kimono? No, not a kimono. Here, I'll show you. There. Something like that. Oh, I catch you. You want me in character. Bergdorf's is going to see this girl. Get a dress like that! Will you pay for it? Yes, now get in there and wash your face. Ok, ok, ok. I'll start this thing over again. It's all right with me, Rembrandt. I'll wear all the clothes you wanna buy me. I could use a couple of dresses and a pair of silk stockings right now. Familiar words. Well. Oh, hello, dearie. Standish! Hiya, Jerry. Hi, dear. Hi, darling. What's the idea of engaging a model without my... okay? Well, er... Oh, my error. Arnold is the name. Miss Arnold, Miss Collins. Mr. Standish. How do you do? Charmed. Take a good look. It's free. Okay, Jerry. Well, got a lot of new clothes, eh? What are you going to call this new opera, Jerry? Oh, Hope, I guess. From the way I've been stretching my neck, this picture oughta be called the lost Zeppelin. Quite a humorist, isn't she, dearie? Come over here, Miss Arnold. Let me have a look at you. Perhaps I can suggest a better title. Well? How do you like it? I like it. You would. Tell me. Is it customary for an artist to purchase the wardrobe of his model? That depends on the model. Napoleon Brandy. Where did you get it? The old venue. Three bottles. Sorry, I'm an orphan. Jerry, how long is this new picture going to take? Oh, I don't know. You can't put the time clock on these things. What's the matter, aren't things working out? I can't seem to get started. For a while I had a great idea. I guess I got the wrong model. I've got a better idea. Don't get started. Your father's yacht is lying in a harbor just dying to go somewhere. For two cents I'd take you up. Darling, that means yes. What a beautiful, easy husband you'll be to manage. Look, Jerry. We'll map out the course at dinner. Come on, Bill, before he changes his mind. Don't rush me. I too have my art. Well, to a lost hope. Oh, come on, Bill. Well, if you trip over anything, it's me. Do you remember that lovely place we went in Chicago... Come on, I'll show you that pretty girl, darling. Bye, angel. Take care of the bar, Jerry. Thanks, I'll see myself out. What are you laughing at? You're no artist. You give up too easy. I knew you were only an amateur. But I can work. Come on, let's go ahead and play art. I'm not paying you $2 an hour for your opinion of art or of me. All you have to do is sit there and look up. And shut up. Yes, sir. Chin up, please. It's just a ceiling. I don't care what anybody says, it's just a ceiling. Hey, Kay, are you up? Up? I'm nearly out. All I know is I've got a stiff neck. I rode in one of those rumble seats last night. Sweet spirits of Zachary. Where did you get the uniform? Bought it. I didn't know Woolworth sold clothes. Don't show your ignorance. This frock... Frock? You heard me. Frock. When a dress costs over a hundred bucks it's a frock. All that's worrying me is my neck is killing me. Oh, wait, I'll fix it for you. Where is it? Right there. There? Hm-hm. How does that feel? Oh, no kidding, Dot. A century and a half this dress set me back. Don't you like it? You look like somebody else. I am somebody else. I'm little red riding hood. That's his idea of a good time. You know the old bromide. When in Greece open a restaurant. Yeah? I'll take mink. What's the matter with this sap of yours? Is he a Scotsman or something? I ain't so sure he's sap at all. He's a whole lot different. I can't make him out. You mean to tell me he ain't even falling for you? Falling? He ain't even tripping. He don't look at me. He looks right through me. I'm just part of his routine, like his paints and brushes. Say, if I didn't know you real well I'd say you were going sour. What do you do up there all day long? Just sit around and look at the ceiling. I'm supposed to see the stars, the great, big, beautiful stars. Stop, stop, you're breaking my heart. And the picture he's painting, he's gonna call it Hope. Hope? Yeah, he thinks I'm just full of hope. I think he's just full of hop. Listen try to call me at 4 o'clock, will you? Gee, Dot, you sleep too much. You're getting awful fat. I should worry. If I get too fat I'll get married and retire. Marry? Who's gonna marry you? Say, do I look like a cripple or something? I read somewhere in a book that you can't have your cake and eat it too. Aw, baloney. Sure you can have your cake and eat it. Yeah, how? Have two cakes. Well, look who's here. Bon-fire, bon-gallery. Good morning, how are you, Jerry? How did you happen to get up before noon? The most amazing alibi in the world. I've been up all night. And I thought our old friend Napoleon might still be at home. So, if so, I thought I'd spend this beautiful Sunday morning swigging Nappy. You will not. You're gonna get out of here. You can take that bottle with you, but I've got some work to do. Work? Brrrr. Work! Have you, er... Good! Have I what? You haven't given up Hope, have you? Ah, never give up hope, no. You know... I've been thinking. I've been thinking of that young lady. You know, Jerry, she's a minor. Well, you're a liar. She's over 18. I don't mean that kind of a minor. I mean a gold miner. I don't agree with you. See this? What's that got to do with it? I missed this wallet the first time I met Kay. This morning I found it on my dresser. Does that sound like gold-mining? She probably gave it back because there wasn't enough in it. I refer you to a chapter in the Bible that says about a... It says an Ethahopian, an Othahep... well, anyway, some guy who's full of Ether had to change his color and a leopard always takes off his own spats. I know a leopard can't change its spots. And there's something in the same book... about people who live in glass bottles, er... houses. All the way up, brother. Now, my next lecture... Never mind the bedtime story There's a little red school... I'm over 18 years old, you know. Most men never get to be 18. And most women are over 18 when they're born. The man who understands all about women. It cost me a fortune, but I am he. Now, listen, Jerry, I don't want to butt in, but I have noticed certain symptoms in that young lady. She's dynamite. I knew a girl like that once... Go ahead talking, I'm listening. But she had a certain quality that... Thank you for your gentlemanly attention. Well, I'll tell it to you, Nappy. Taking a little nippy with Nappy. Josephine was your water hoses, and you know it, wasn't she? Well... Good morning, Josephine. Drunk again. Congratulations. So am I. Where's the boss? He's dressing. Oh, you've been dressing up since I saw you the last time, eh? Hm-hm. My, you're smart. Why, it's changed you completely. Hm-hm. But you haven't changed much, have you? I've heard rumors... What's the chance of a little look, oh... oh, oh. How's this work of art coming along? It ain't started yet. We can't seem to get together on a pose. Have you ever done any posing before? I'm always posing. How do you spend your nights? Free posing. No offense, I just wondered if you had any evenings open? I know all the places. I've been to all the places. I bet you've never been to Havana. I'm going there shortly myself. Bon voyage. It won't be a very bon voyage if I go alone. Would you like to come along? Oh, I can be approached. Make me an offer. You don't think the big boss will object... Object? He wouldn't even know I was gone. Well, if you want the trip to Havana you let me know... I'm sorry to rush you Bill... I've just been trying to date up your model... Miss Arnold, I'll call you up in a few days when I've had some sleep... Thanks for that. Nice fellow, Napoleon. I think I'll get a studio for myself and take up art seriously. It's work, you know. Work? Oh, that's a lie... I couldn't imagine anybody having to work... Hey, listen. She's a festive girl and I think I'm gonna steal her. I thought you said she was dynamite. What's dynamite for one fellow is bromide suds to another. Oh, boy, you're a fake. Okay, I'll remember that. Alright, now, Miss Arnold. Let's get to work. Say, that's a fast worker that pal of yours. He wants to date me up. Is it all right if I go with him? With Standish? Certainly. Splendid fellow. Well, I don't know. I thought maybe... I didn't know. I thought maybe er... Yes? Oh, it's nothing. But there's one thing about him. He certainly notices things. Don't you notice anything? Yes, you're chewing gum again. Oh, no. Well, now... I got a new dress on. Oh, so you have. It's the one you wanted me to get. It is, isn't it? Suits you very well too. Let me know how much it cost and I'll give you a check for it. Oh, no you won't. Since when are you buying my clothes? And there's another thing I wanna know. There are a millions models in this town. Why did you have to pick on me for? I don't know. But that first night when you were asleep... you looked like another woman. You were yourself. Not like you are now. I'm always myself. No you're not. You're covered up. This is the fourth time I've started this picture. And you know why? 'Cause you're... I'm what? I don't know what. It's like a man I knew once. He was suspicious. Bitter, hard, cruel. All those things were written on his face, like I'm after his life. He died. I saw him laid out. His face was a new face. It was fine, noble. There was peace in it. He was himself again. You see what I mean? No. All I get out of it is you gotta die to find yourself. Not me. Nor for $2 an hour. Want a raise? No. Well I guess I better quit the lecturing anyhow. Come on, let's get back to work and... hope. Look through the ceiling. You almost had it yesterday. You were nicer to me yesterday. Hello. Oh, hello, mother. Tonight? Fine, we haven't been to the opera for weeks. Who's going to be there? And Claire, too? Fine. All right, I'll be over for dinner. Goodbye. All right, now, Miss Arnold. Sit back a little bit there now. Chin up. That woman that comes up here all the time, who is she? I'll have to ask you to be perfectly still. Ok. I don't want to hear you talk at all. But if I were you I'd look out for her. If I were you I'd confine myself to posing. That's what you're here for. Yes sir, Mr. Strong, excuse me. Hard to make up your mind? Almost impossible. Do you think I'm too fat? There couldn't be too much of you. Oh, Billy, where have you been all my life? Well, I think I'll have oyster cocktail, And pea soup. Filet mignon. Hm, let's see. Hash brown, consomm?e and salad and I want gobs and gobs and gobs of oil. And uh, what do you think I should have for dessert? Oh, I'd have something light. Strawberry shortcake here is very good. Two. And a cup of coffee. Large or small? Do I look like a small cup of coffee? Non, madame. I don't mind telling you, Mr. Standish, I'm awfully glad Kay was out when you called tonight. Where do you suppose she's gone? I know where she went. The opera with her boyfriend. Are you sure of that? Where else would she go? One at a time. That's her policy. I'd play the same system if I could get a man with 6 million dollars. Jerry hasn't 6 million kopeks. No, but his old man has. How do you know that? Listen, Mr. Standish, in our flat we ain't got much of a library Only two books. The phone book and Bradstreet. Have you looked me up? Sure. You're only in the phone book. With me it's different. It's just just one piker after another. Will you kindly respect my gray hair? Until I met you. Aw, look at those cute little oysters. Ok, Mein. How did you enjoy the opera? It was grand. It was beautiful. Oh, boy, what music. It was like the ocean. Gee, you could just float in it. Did he introduce you to any of his swell friends? I went alone. You told me you were going with him. Supposing I did. You mean to tell me you bought your own ticket? When you bumped into this dump fish you said he was a blank check. I guess the check was rubber. He's a bust, huh? No, I'm a bust. A fellow by the name of Standish came over to see you tonight. Yeah? What did he want? He didn't want me. But he's coocoo about you. I think he's a great fellow. You know, if I were you... But you ain't me. You never held anything out on me before, honey. You aren't falling for this artist guy, are you? Who said so? You think I could fall for that paint sling and high hat with his cockeyed idea of hope and stars? I hate him. I wish I'd never met him. Hello, Dot. Hello, Kay. Hello, Charlie. How about a little exercise? Sure, anything. Say, Kay, I missed you. Where have you been keeping yourself? Oh, what's the diference? Let's dance. The old blue number, eh? Well, I'll beat the blues away. Hello. Yes. Yes, she is. Certainly. Miss Lamar wants to talk to you, Miss Arnold. Thanks. Hello. Hello, hon. Am I taking you away from anything important? No, it's a rest period. We're working tonight. The boss is taking the air outside. Here. No, no, no. I just made it. It's good. I'll have it later. The Standish guy was here to see you tonight. Yeah? What did he want? Seems he has two tickets on a boat to Havana. And he says you're the other ticket. Seems he's a friend of this artist guy and he don't wanna let on he's competition. Mr. Quinlan, you stop! Listen, I got one of these hysterical husbands here tonight. Yeah. Say, why don't we make this a foursome? You and the artist, me and Standish. I'm not going to Havana. I'm just a poor working girl. Besides, we're working overtime tonight. Atta Kay, atta Kay. Don't worry. I'll be home later. Toodle-oo. Here you are, baby. Mr. Quinlan, if you ever do that again... I'm gonna sock you right in the nose. Do you mind if I sit here a while? No, I'd be glad to have you. Be careful there. Oh, don't worry about me. I never get dizzy. Look at them twinkle. Don't they, though? Like a lot of fireflies. And the people look like little bugs. Oh, not down there. Look up here. Oh, they're too far away. You can reach for them just the same. What good are they? A lot of good. Mariners use them to steer by when they lose their way. And they always get to port. Have you ever been to Arizona? Furthest west I've been is Jersey City. Great place to live Arizona. Great place to paint. No skyscrapers to stab the horizon. Nothing but purple hills. Even the stars seem closer. You can almost reach it and grab the big dipper by the hand. How long do you figure it's gonna take you to finish this painting? Oh, I don't know, why? I wanna quit. Wanna quit? Hm-hm. What for? Don't I pay enough? Yes. Well, what then? Oh, I don't know. Would it put you out any if I quit? Would you care? No, only I'd like to finish the job I started. Is that all? What do you mean is that all? What difference does it make whether you do finish it? Who cares? It'll be just another painting. The museum is full of paintings. Now look here, Miss Arnold. Miss Arnold, Miss Arnold! Can't you call me Kay? What am I? A statue or a hunk of furniture? That's the way you treat me. I'm a human being. Oh, I wish I was dead. Now, stop it. Cut it out. Kay. Don't, Kay. Please. Oh, I'm no good. You are so. I'll prove it. I'll put it on canvas. If you only won't quit. Well, I wouldn't quit for a million dollars. If you call me Kay I won't quit. I knew you wouldn't... Kay. I know it's a tiresome job. No, it isn't. It's a beautiful job. I love it. Even if it takes you fifty years to finish. Now, stop the crying. Am I good-looking? I'll say you are. Am I better looking than... that other one that comes up here? Well, that's a peculiar question. You're just not the same type at all. What were you saying about Arizona? Well... Everything's different out there. The stars are closer. The atmosphere is... Hold it. Hold it. That's the look I've been after. That's what I want to paint. Come on here now. Hold it now. Yes. Just the way you are now. Don't lose it. That's fine. Just the way you were. Just like that now. Oh, I'm all right. Will you take a little water? Please. I guess I got a little dizzy. I'm sorry. I can pose again in a few minutes. I'm awfully sorry. I didn't dream it was this late. I wouldn't have kept you sitting there that long. We'll quit now. I'll make this up to you, Miss Arnold. I'll give you an extra check. Much obliged. Well... I guess I'd better be going. Do you mind if I sit by the fire and warm before I go? Certainly not. You know, it's awfully late And it's raining. I think you'd better stay here all night. Oh, no, thanks I'll get a taxi. I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. You can take my room. Oh, please. I'd rather not. I don't want to inconvenience you. Well, if you don't want to do that, take the couch. You mean you want me to stay here all night? Sure. If you feel better we'll get started early in the morning. Oh, boy. I'm glad we're started too. Yeah, we're started. I'll get you some things. l'lI bet this old couch is gossiping. You're the first young lady to spend the night in this studio. Yeah? Now tell me the one about the travelling salesman. Dot sure would get a laugh out of this. What was that? Nothing. Just talking to myself. Well. Here's some pajamas for you. I guess they'll be a little bit large, won't they? Well. I guess that'll be plenty warm, won't it? Hm-hm. If there's anything you want, just call me. Good night. Good night. Well, good night. There. Good morning. Oh, good morning. You didn't have to do that. There's a servant in the house. Well, I thought maybe if I cooked it myself, you might invite me to breakfast. Well, set them down there. You might put it down a little bit. Give me your plate. Oh, me? No, I'm not hungry. I never eat breakfast. Oh, here. Go ahead, you can read your paper. Don't mind me. Can you do that? I can do better than that. Young lady, come over here. Come on. Now what's the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing. I forgot your sugar. I know. You only take one. Oh, good morning, Jerry. Well, good morning, Governor. Meet Miss Arnold, my model. How do you do, Miss Arnold? How do you do? I hope I don't intrude. Oh, no. We worked late last night so... I understand. Art and all that. How come this early morning visit? Aren't the railroads running this morning? On schedule as usual. Machines are great things. They never get tired. But I am. Jerry, your mother and I are going away. To Paris for a year. Oh, that'll be a lot of fun. You deserve it, dad. You know, Paris is a great art center. How would you like to spend the year with us there? You and Claire. With Claire? Yes. Wedding first. Your mother suggested it. We thought it would be a good idea for you and Claire to get married next week. It's our wedding anniversary and we would make it a double honeymoon. We talked it over last night. Nobody's talked it over with me yet. That's what I dropped in for. I'm afraid I can't make it. I've got a lot of work to do. Is it more important than your wedding? No, but there's plenty of time for that. I don't agree with you. You've been engaged too long now, Jerry. That's what we were talking also about last night. We? Was I there? Don't you think I ought to be consulted about my marriage? Any reason for the delay? Yes. There's the picture I'm doing. The picture? Or the model? I wish you'd talk sense. I will, since you ask it. Young woman. Miss Arnold. After you've had your breakfast I suggest you drop in my office. You'll find me very liberal. What the devil are you talking about? Shall I tell him? Sure, tell both of us. Wait a minute now, Miss Arnold is my guest. I have every intention of treating Miss Arnold with the all respect she's entitled to. I've been very patient with you, Jerry. And I don't propose... Now just a moment, sir. Kay, do you mind going in to my room for a minute? I want to talk to my father alone. Wait. I'm sorry, Jerry. But she's got to hear what I have to say. Young woman, I've gone to the trouble of looking you up. I know all about you. Why you're here. You're not a model at all. Wait a minute. You're talking nonsense. Nonsense? Am I talking nonsense? Well? What have you got to say? Nothing. I'm going. She may not have anything to say but I've got plenty. You have no right to come in here like this. And I'm not gonna stand for you or anybody else. Wait, Jerry. I know what you're going to say but it doesn't make any difference. I hired her to be my model and I'm gonna paint her. No, you're not going to paint her. You're going to get rid of her. I think not. You know my wishes don't matter. Respect them or not, as you will. But I'll add this. If you do not get rid of that girl I'll do it for you. Kay! Don't you dare go out that door, do you hear me? You're staying right here. But your father... What's he got to do with it? Who hired you anyway? Now take off that coat. Come on. Now get to work. Now sit there and don't you move. Do you understand me? Oh, stop it. Tears all over the house. Come on now, chin up. Do you hear me? Chin up, I said. But, Jerry, after what your father told you... Do you think he told me anything I haven't known all along? Don't you think I know why you came up here? Do you think I'm blind? Don't you suppose I know what your game is? You took my pocketbook the first night I met you, didn't you? And I know what you are. You're nothing but a dirty little blackmailer. You're a thief. That's what you are. You're nothing but a common little... Don't say it that. Please. I'm sorry. Say it, Jerry. Please say it. Just once. Jerry. Oh, lock the door, Jerry, please. Why? I'm afraid. Someone might come in and take you away from me. Someone take you away from me? You wouldn't let them? They haven't got a chance. You think I'd let anybody take you away from me? That would be awful. I should say not. Don't you worry about that. I wish I were being born this morning. I wish I could be reborn all over again. So I could wait for you to come along. I wish I could be somebody else. So I could be everything... to you. Everything. Why, you're everything in the world to me now. Oh, Jerry. Sure, I don't care how my father takes it. I'm gonna tell him. Oh, no. Please don't tell him. Let's go to Arizona. Tonight. Now. You can paint. I can work. Gee, I'll cook for you and wash for you and everything. We don't need money. We don't need anybody. Oh, you stop worrying. Do you hear? I'm the boss now. Stop that. Come on now, let's see that smile. Can you do that? Sure... since you did. Come on now, sweetheart. Don't you worry. When I tell dad what you mean to me everything will be all right. Tell them I'll never get in their way. I'll change my name or something. They won't have to introduce me to people. I'll hide. If they only just let me be around. You tell them that, Jerry. Tell them. Believe me, I'll tell them plenty. Goodbye now. Don't you worry. I'll be right straight back. My heart isn't gonna beat again until I see you. Don't you worry. Everything is gonna be all right. I know how you feel, dad. Ever since I can remember you've been kind. You let me paint against your will because I loved it. And maybe the same thing that made me want to paint makes me love this girl. I don't care anything about your money but I want to keep you. Let's be friends. Kay and I will go away. We'll let nobody sneer at us. We'll hide away. Some day we'll come back with our kids. And you'll take her in your arms, I know you will, dad. And you'll be proud of me, too. What do you say, dad? Jerry... if you marry that girl, I never want to see you again. All right. Sit there. I don't care if I ever see you again either. Goodbye, mother. No, not goodbye. I want to see my Jerry again no matter what he may do. What do you want me to do? Whatever you think right, Jerry, dear. I knew you'd say that. Goodbye, dear. Dinner is served. Vanderbilt 7773, please. Hello. Hello, Kay? This is Jerry. Well, how long will it take to pack your things? I mean we're leaving. Leaving tonight for Arizona. Never mind, dear. I'll tell you later. You go home and pack. But what happened? I'll tell you later. Go home and pack. Alright. Come in. Miss Arnold? No, I'm Dot Lamarr. Anything I can do for you? No, it's a personal matter. Perhaps I'd better call later. Oh, no. Wait a minute. Sit down. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Do you think Miss Arnold will be home soon? Sure, don't worry. She's been doing a little posing for the last couple of months. Punching a timeclock. Can you beat that? Are you a friend of Miss Arnold's? I'll say so. We're more like sisters. I borrow her teddies and she's always using my lipstick. The reason we get along is we ain't in competition, you know. I don't think I quite understand. Oh, that's easy. The bozos that fall for me can't see Kay. And the johns who go gaga over Kay can't see me no matter how much there is of me. Kay and me never battle though. I'm gonna tell you. Between the two of us, they never get away. I'll never forget the night we... Hey, Dot, I got something to tell... Kay, there's a lady to see you. I've been entertaining her. You want me to mix up something? I would like to see you alone, Miss Arnold. Yes, certainly. Dot... I'm out like the light. I'm Jerry's mother. I'm glad to meet you. I guess Jerry's told you. Yes, and I must confess that I rather suspected to find a different sort of person. You mean you're disappointed? Quite the contrary. I'm most agreeably surprised. I'm sure you're a very clever girl. Clever? I don't blame Jerry a bit for being attracted by you. Thanks. And now that I've paid you a compliment, you must pay me one by admitting that you know why I'm here. But I don't. If there's anything I can do for you. I have some wealth, some position... There's a great deal that you might persuade me to do for you. Oh, I see. You've come here to make a deal with me. Well I don't mind the insult to me, Mrs. Strong, but you're insulting Jerry too. If you're trying to get me to give him up you're wasting your time. You've got no right to ask me. I won't do it. I'm not asking for myself. Jerry has split with his father. Mr. Strong is a man of the highest principles. And he doesn't approve. How about you, Mrs. Strong? Well, I don't know you. And your husband? What does he know about me? He tells me... Oh, wait. Don't say it. It's true. Won't you sit down? Thank you. I guess Jerry loves you an awful lot. I've heard him talk on the phone with you. I guess I'm in the worst jam anybody ever was. I wonder if you'll be kind enough to let me tell you my side. Certainly. Suppose somebody has... oh, say, consumption... that bars him from a lot of things. It's a kind of closed door. But supposing they're cured? Don't you think that door ought to open? Wait... Jerry knows all about me. I didn't want this to happen. I even fought against it. But it did. Jerry loves me and I love him. Do you believe that? Yes, I believe you. Your husband says he looked me up. Alright, but I'm different now. Do you believe that? I'm willing to believe that. Then why, why can't I? I understand. But most people won't. They consider you a handicap for Jerry. His friends will all slip away. Friends? His people. His world. He'll lose it and after a time he'll miss it and realize it. I know he won't blame you. But you'll blame yourself. That's why you must give him up. I love him. He's the only man I've ever loved. I couldn't live without him. I'll work for him. I'll take care of him. Gee, I'd die for him. He don't need his father, he don't need you. I won't give up. I won't listen to you. Get out! Get out. Oh, wait. Give me a minute to think. Excuse me, Mrs. Strong. Oh, I wish he was poor. I wish he was nobody. I wish he was sick so nobody else wanted him. Do you think I'm so bad? I don't think you're bad at all, my dear. I won't even say that you're not worthy of him. I'm not here to judge you. I'm here to ask you to give him up. Why? Why? Because you love him. And deep down in your heart you know the reason. You see, I'm being cruel because I love him. He'll hate me when he finds out. But I must risk his hate. I must fight for him. That's what mothers are for. Are they? I wish I had one to fight for me. The only break I ever got... the only thing in the world I ever wanted... and you ask me to give it up. I don't think that I have to ask you. You love him too much to want to hurt him. No... You don't have to ask me. You win. You all win. You won a long time ago. Long before I met Jerry. Long before any of us were born you won. But there's one thing you can't take away from me. He held me in his arms. And he told me he loved me. Oh, it's all right, Mrs. Strong. I liked you... laughingly. We both love him. And yet only one of us is willing to give him up. I'm rather ashamed of myself. And I shall always remember you, my dear. Oh, I wouldn't if I were you. Don't blame yourself. I probably would have figured it out myself if you hadn't tipped me off. Don't worry about me. Goodbye, Mrs. Strong. Goodbye, my dear. Please try not to hate me too much. I couldn't hate you. You're his mother. I couldn't help it. I was listening. Oh, that's awful. And I don't mind telling you. If you listen to that dame you're the biggest fool that ever was. That's all right. Aw, honey... Here... What are you gonna do? Go somewhere... He'll never see me again. Kay, are you drunk or something? That's an idea. Atta girl, Kay. Now you're talking. Oh, we're all out of it. Now come on, cheer up. Come on, you forget about it all and I'll be back in just a minute. And you wait right here now. And don't you move. Bryant 3420 Telephone, sir. Am I in or out? Hello. Hello, Mr. Standish? This is Kay Arnold. Hello, hello. How are you? Fine. I feel like getting into trouble. I don't know whether to be insulted or complimented. You caught me right in the middle of my packing. I'm packing, too. Where am I going? Havana. Havana? Why that's a peculiar coincidence. I'm bound there, too. I'm going with you. Can you get another ticket? I always carry a spare for emergencies like this. You won't be disappointed. They tell me I'm pretty good company. If you really mean this you'd better hurry up because we're leaving at ten and... I'll stop by and pick you up a cab. I'll be ready. Just blow your horn and I'll come down. Oh, Mr. Standish... Is there a bar on the boat? A bar? That's all this boat is: just one long bar. Gee, that's great. Goodbye. Come in. I suppose you wanna know what happened. I think I can guess. They didn't understand. But it doesn't matter. Everything will be all right. I got a surprise for you. You know what it is? Tickets to Arizona. We're leaving at midnight. I was on my way now to throw my things together and I came by for you. Come on, honey. But I haven't finished packing yet. So you haven't. Well, how long will it take you? Oh, an hour maybe. Well... I'll be back for you. Wait a minute. I hope you didn't break with your folks altogether. I don't want you to lose anything on my account. No... Don't you worry. It's their loss. Not mine. And besides, we've got our own lives to live. If you and I were the only two people in this world... That's what it'll be like in Arizona. You know who our neighbours will be? Sheep. Come on, now. I gotta be going. Don't go, Jerry. Tell me some more about Arizona. All right. Well, to begin with, we'll get up every morning with the sun. And I'll cook breakfast? Yes, and we'll go horseback riding, out in the open every day. And I'll paint you on top of some mesa against the desert sunset. And when it gets dark we'll come home under the stars. There'll be millions of them. So close down that you can almost reach up and grab them. Tell me some more. Well, when we get home we'll be as hungry as a couple of wolves. And I'll cook you a grand dinner. Yes. And I'll read you last month's newspaper til you're drousy. And then you'll go to sleep in my arms. Like you did the first night I met you. Oh, Jerry. Blow the horn. What's that? Oh, nothing. I guess I'm so happy I'm jumpy. Run along now. You have to pack. What are you so nervous about? Nothing. Jerry! Hold me tight for a minute. Give her a horn. You have to go, I forgot. We're leaving at midnight. All right, now. I'll hurry back. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! You'll like Havana. Bright sun... Races, casino, bars all open... Lots of pretty girls just like you are. Vanderbilt 7773 They don't answer? Well, thank you. Do you know anything about Arizona? No I don't, really. They tell me there's a lot of desert, though. What are you worrying about deserts for? Can you reach up and grab them in Havana? Grab what? The stars. Well, I don't think there's any law against it. When you get to Havana you can have the sun, the moon, the stars, the whole world. But you'll have to smile a little bit for it. Oh, don't worry about me. You needn't be afraid you're taking a dead woman along. I'll snap out of this like nobody's business. But you gotta promise me one thing. What? When we get on that boat I wanna get cockeyed. That makes it unanimous. A-deck to your left, B-deck to your right. Right along, folks. A-deck to your left, B-deck to your right. Right along. A-deck to your left, B-deck to your right. Right here, all right. Barroom is around the corner, sir. Alright. Thank you. Well, I'll be seeing you 12 miles out. Alright. Oh, come on. Chin up. Please don't say that. I'll see if the bar is open and we'll get cockeyed. Hey, there, wake up, wake up. Come on. Get me up to Jerry Strong's apartment. One moment, miss. You need to be announced. What name, please? Er, Lydia Pinkham. Very well, Miss Pinkham. Listen, just say it's a friend of Kay Arnold's calling. Very well, Miss Pinkham. Take a wire, please. Yeah, to Dick Howard. Mesa Grand, Arizona. The line is either busy or out of order.
