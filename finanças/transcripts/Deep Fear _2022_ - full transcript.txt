- Nope ! Nope ! Growl No! Nope ! No ! No ! - How is it ? - Not bad, actually. Really. - Don't you only have foam? - As with the straw, I inhale, the alcohol rises faster. - Mhh-hmm. - Really. - OK. - What's the idea? - The straw allows you to get stuffed faster. - Who said that ? - OK. The story of Uncle Zames. Against military service, choice: mental retardation community life impossible or... - Breadwinner. - So. My uncle Zames was none of the three. Like you, he pretended to be a dick in the entrance test. - OK. - Which went wrong. They didn't reform it and they screwed it up in a section uh... with all the leftovers. Muscle instead of brain. The sequel is less funny. A genie behind him had misplaced the safety of his weapon. He shot. Bam... the bullet, in Uncle Zames' cheek. - Do not ? - Yup. - He is... ? He is dead ? - Fortunately not. But... Ever since, Uncle James has been Uncle Zames. He lisps, the idiot. - Are you kidding me ? - No it's true. - All that for this ? - So already, it's not funny. He has his tongue split out. - Very funny! - I don't want to end up lisping like him. - You're with. - And for my last moments of freedom, the plan? - Exactly, I'm waiting for my plan to arrive. Ah, there he is. - I will be back. Excuse. - No do not worry. - Yeah, I like that. - Man, I swear, try the straw, it's better. - How you doing?. - How you doing?. - Hey... You're less warm than last time. - I'm less drunk. - Right answer. I have that. T'as mes thunes ? - How much is it ? - It's 60 bullets. - 60? - Yeah. - It's super expensive. - It's Paris. She sighs. Thanks a lot. - Do you have a good plan tonight? - What kind of plan? - Two friends are there this weekend, one of whom is going to do his service. I'd like to suggest something funnier than usual. - Tonight, I can't. Because... Life. But uh, tomorrow afternoon, if you want... If you want to see Paris differently, I can suggest something. - Hold on. Tomorrow afternoon? - Yeah. - I wasn't talking about a snack. - Oh yes ? Neither do I. He whispers. - Come on, children of the fatherland No! Pa-trii-iieuh - Why on the right? We have already turned right. She laughs. - Come on, you have to practice. Patri... - Sonia, this is where you live. - What ? - That way, right? - I think you're right. I believe you are right. - It was sure. I swear, I knew it. - Hey, look at that! - What's this ? - The girl's number from the bar. - Two hours of m... - Hush. It's old people next door. - But two hours of walking. - Hush. Put your bags there. The door slams. Hush! - I am exhausted. He blows. We should have taken a taxi. I would have paid for it. - Must not be cloistered. - Is it the toilet? - I believe. - You can piss and make yourself pasta. - Funny, that. - Yeah, it's funny. - Well, look. I have something to make you a little more comical. Finally, I hope. - It's phew like... Only the encounters remain. Eh ? And the probability what kind of you, you and me, there are three of us in the same amphitheater at the same time... Drop it. It is calculated, a probability like that? He's snoring. - How you doing?. Hey, chut. Hey, look at me. Calm down. Breathe. You have nothing to fear. Hmm ? They are different. They looked for him. Bad Company. But you... Toi... It's not your fault. Hmm ? You were just born here. Your parents are the problem. I guess. French father, but Algerian mother, huh? Look at me. Look at me. Look. Look. Very well. So... *- The form ? *- You know, you won't be able to film anything there? *- Whoa! Monsieur is in a bad mood. *- Max, stop, seriously. It's historical, interesting and free. Everything to please you. - Yeah. What I like is to avoid the light. - Don't complain, it's your last day and we're doing something cool. - There's a legal version of the visit, in the 14th. - Are you scared? You can film yourself: "I'm the little freak of the group." - Frames: Henry, Max. Max, Henry: Rama. Notre... Notre "guide". - How you doing?. Well... You don't look fresh. - Whose fault is it ? - What's the plan? - The plan is that... you followed me... under Paris. - The catacombs... - Welcome to the little belt. An old railway line built a long time ago, abandoned when they built the metro. We are going there. Below us are the sewers. Below the sewers, there is the metro. And below the metro, there is the Holy Grail. - Where we emptied the cemeteries of Paris? - Exactly. He's not serious, is he? Sonia rit. How you doing?. A woman is coughing. - It sucks here, doesn't it? - No, it doesn't suck. Everyone is nice here, it's a family. I will be back. - Sonia. - What is it between you? exactly ? - That's to say ? - That's to say... Between you two, what exactly is going on? Sonia souffle. I know you. If you're a badger that you've only seen twice, there must be something. - I have the itinerary. - What was the guy talking about? - He's a cataphile friend, we exchanged information. - Attends... Un cataphile ? Is that what your name is? And that is a cata-card? - You're with. - On and goes? - And uh... Can we have more details on the process? - It's a free world, below. Without rules. A bit like... the middle of the ocean. It belongs to no one, each for himself. It's the charm, the danger, the unknown. Just avoid the pirates. Don't worry, we'll be careful, nothing will happen to you. We're going down here. Have you ever done caving? - Nope. - Nope. - Is there anyone cloistered? - Cloister, parano... Nyctophobe, kénophobe, scotophobe, musophobe. Already... There's a lot of... a lot of possible phobias in there. - Flashlights. Here. Here. - Thanks. - Are they new? - Yeah. - Never mind. - Too bad what? - Feet forward. - So much for what? - Anyway, they're too white. - Sorry ? What ? It does not exist, "too white". (- Son of a bitch.) - Max, how are you? - Relax, huh? Is that it, Max? Relax, breathe calmly and let yourself go in the cat flap. - You'll be fine, move slowly. - Damn... Can't we do an exhibition, like everyone else? - Come on, Max! - Little X, there. Tac. - That's it ? - Yeah. The rounding there is that one. Then we'll go there. - OK. - Well, okay... - How did you do ? Laugh - Feet first, he said. - The bag between the legs. - Hurry, seriously. - Are there other plans like that? - Let's go ? - Come on, Max! - You suck, man. We all put 30 seconds, and you, pellets. - Are you catching me? - Don't worry. - Attention, the old lighting system, It's great for getting tetanus. - Oh fuck ! - What ? - There was a rat! - There aren't any in the catacombs. - Yes, I saw one. Don't worry, these rats have leptospirosis. It's super lethal to humans. - Add "hypochondriac" to your list. Are you Ramy? - Yeah. - Well tell me, Ramy, when are we going to get the hang of it? - Patience, I'll take you to a corner... A place of phew. - Is that normal? - We're going to have visitors. - What kind of visit? - This kind of smoke is to sow the cops. - So there are cops? - Especially now. People get high, they beat them up. If you see nothing, you don't care. Walk along the wall, take small steps it's straight ahead. - Wonderful. - One more ! Turn around! How much are you ? - There are only four of us. - Oui. - Do not move ! You don't move! - It's forbidden, descents. You knew that, right? - We got lost... - The farm ! - Turn around! - You've been here before. Embark it! - Damn, I've never been here. - You think it's a game? Do you have fun? Is it smart to follow a stranger into the catacombs? - You know we don't know him? (- Damn, shut up.) - What did she say ? What did you say ? Repeat it. - You said "follow a stranger." How do you know ? People burst out laughing, cheering and clapping. - Good job guys ! They walked! - She's great, mate! - You're already family! - Marvellous. Wonderful. How are you ? - I'm fine and you ? - Welcome, guys! - Bon... Well, that was a cataphile joke. That's a beer. And... that's Faust. Welcome to the catacombs. - Where are you going? - At the cathedral. - Hmm ! It's one of my favorite places. We come for these kinds of places. It combines prohibition and freedom. - Where is the access for the area? - What access? - Eh eh. The "white zone". Ancient and unexplored. Except that our friends here have found an access... finally! - Ancient how? - I do not know. We were just able to pass the head. The cat flap is unstable, it moves with each metro. We consolidate it. It's not like we thought. It looks much newer. - Without dec'? - Yeah. But no one has entered it for centuries. - Hi. - Hi. - Henry. - Lamia. - Lamia? It's super pretty. Is that your cata-nom? - Very funny. It's my real first name. - Doesn't everyone have a nickname? - Yes. For the most part. They come to escape. So... - Thank you for the welcoming. It was very nice. - We've all been there. Sorry. It's you who's leaving au service ? How are you feeling ? - It's not phew. - What are you going down for? - My brother was staying here. He disappeared two years ago. So, well... there you go. I am here for this. - It's hot. Me, I am an only child. With my parents, we don't get along. My two friends, there, it's absolutely my whole life. So... * You must not let go. *- It's certain. *- If one of them disappeared, I would never let go. - Mind your head. - Bingo. - Good thing you're here. - Did you get her number, too? - Nope. Well, not yet. - There's some super stylish stuff. - You haven't seen anything yet! OK. Bon... Here we are. A little thing, few people come here. So, before going there, we close our eyes for a moment... And we pray to the catacombs. Let's go ? Head first, this time, Max. - It is serious, your friend ? - Head first. Crie framework. - Wow. Henry siffle. - Oh yeah... There, I understand the delirium. - Where are we ? - Where Baron Haussmann took his pebbles to build Paris. Not bad huh ? Paname is a Gruyère. Above your heads is the Latin Quarter. Over there, the Panthéon, Luxembourg, Odéon. Port Royal, over there, behind. And all the people walk above us. - Mec... Man, that's huge. It's huge. It changes your rotten corridors! - It's a crazy thing ! - Couldn't we go earlier? - We've been coming here since the beginning! - The camera. - Just take the time. - Very good plan. Long live the cataphiles! - Ah finally ! - I love the catacombs! - You filmed, I hope? - Yeah, I got everything. - It's incredible. Huge, in fact. - Haha yes. - Max, we thought we were great... - Incredible. - We're shit here. - You're the big one, Henry. I'm going to do a documentary on Henry. - My first time here... Uh... He inspires. I had uh... 16 ans. Yeah... It was for a girl, of course. Joan. Unbelievable. She was friends with friends of mine, there was a party here, I followed them. - Et ? - Did you fuck her? - Joan? - Yeah. - Nope. I was too scared. I left on the first outing and never saw her again. Life, what! You feel something, you say nothing, you miss your chance. - I'm going to pee. - Therefore, with her... Was it a disaster? She laughs. Henry, do you have it? Disaster ! - Not gross. - Do you have it? - Ouh. - Feet first, that's the worst thing. - How are you ? - Yes. - You got hurt ? - No, it's fine. - So, not bad, no, as a last day? - It's too good. - Yeah. - What way ? - My hangover is going away. - We are on this axis. - He's nice, but finished, what! The one who is going to blow up everything, there, it is that of Cannes, Zidane. - There, you screw up completely. - Nope. I don't find it bad. But the most exploded is Ma... - Hush. Voice in the distance - Who is that? - I don't know, but it's not good. - Is this another joke? - Hush! No. Shut up ! - Yeah, I know inside out. - It must be demonstrated, that. - Wow ! - Uncle ? - Yeah ? - From where ? - To the right. - You're sure ? - Looks like my room. - Hey, guys, guys? - Yeah ? - Any beers left? - Here. - Donne. Merci. - Me too, can I? - I have more. - Son of a bitch... Fuck it. - Hurry, I don't know where to go. - I'm coming ! (- Oh, no.) (- Shut up.) (- That's disgusting.) (- Max, shut up.) (Chut.) - Come on guys ! - Son of a bitch ! Straight ! Straight ! - Shit ! It's a dead end! - You said left. - Shit ! The halète framework. - So, lost? Need a guide? - Henry ! Henry groaned. - Do not touch me ! - Sonia! - Ah! - Sonia! - Sonia! The blows are raining down. - Hi. Max moans. Excuse my friend, he's a little nervous. Let's get back to basics. OK ? What's your nickname? Answer when I talk to you. (- Sonia.) - I didn't hear. - Sonia. - Ah... That's rebeu, right? Sonya? And you, your last name? He bumps Max, who moans. You see, Uncle? That's exactly my problem. It's because of people like them that we will have them everywhere, people like her. And suddenly, we we must waste our time remembering everyone exactly where they belong! Max and Henry moan. But honestly... It's enjoyable! - Hey ! - Sonia... - No ! - She is sick ! - Stand back. Step back, you! Take off your jackets. Remove them! - Do as she says. - Take them, Max. - What ? - Go get the jackets, Max! - Sonia, it's good there. - Back up, you! - I have them. - Put them in the middle. - Stop, let's break! - Piss on it. - Quoi ? - Piss on jackets! - Son of a bitch. I can't. Would you turn around, please? - Turn around ! - I hate those fucking skinheads! - Son of a bitch ! Where is this exit? - From where ? - To the left ! - To the left ! The ! - From where ? - It's not there. - To be ! - Chut. - What got into you? - It's shot. She just gave him a lead piercing. - It doesn't bother me at all. Where is the exit ? Ho! - She's over there. - You can say we're lost. - There are 300 km of tunnels under Paris, so no, I don't know them all. We'll find an exit. - Yeah... Henry coughs. - Oh, damn... - Wait, are we sure about that? - Do you see another solution? There is a staircase at the end. - Come on. She's super cold. - It's true. (- Oh yeah, damn...) - Not barefoot, we don't know what's at the bottom. - Couldn't you say that before? - What ? Seems normal to me, right? - Listen ! - What, Max? - The... - Holy shit. - There's some in the water. Damn, in the water! - Son of a bitch ! (Max) - It's dangerous. Don't touch them! - It's not normal, I don't get it. - I've never seen one so close. - Ah ! - Normally, there are no rats. - What ? They are there ! - Normally no. - You know them badly, your catacombs. - Come on, Max. - Come on, move. Go-y, advance! You suck, Max. - We're just going down. - We shouldn't be far away. - Very far from what? - What a shitty day. - Frames! - Here, you have an exit, there. - That's welded, guys. - We don't care. We try ? - If you want... - Yeah... Damn. - Voilà. - I wasn't very hot either. - Someone else ? Nope ? - He breaks them for me, your friend, there. - If anyone still had a doubt... I'm telling you, it's official, we're lost. We're here... - Hush. - What now ? Good or bad news ? - Good. It's Dante. uh ben! We meet beautiful people. I'm happy to see you. - What the hell are you doing? You didn't go out by PC? - Yes. Except that we crossed skins. We're looking for another exit. - Ah, the skins... 20 years that I go down, 20 years that there are. - Hey! Come back! - It's here ? - We just finished. We're all going to pass now. - Incredible, damn it. And... does it hold despite the metro? - I'm not going through a hole. Quoi ? - Come on, move on. - That was Lamia, right? - What's the difference ? - Well, everything! - Wow... The zone blanche. Oh, it's beautiful. - It should hold. The metro makes her shake a little, but she won't collapse. - You come ? - We got screwed by skins. We can go out ? - I'll look inside for 2 minutes. Then I'll take you out. - Can't you go after? - It's on the other side of the wall. - We don't know what's over there. - Are you worried about me? - No, for us. We have collected enough as it is. I asked you something fun. We get chased and beaten by skins, I'm shooting a guy... We don't know what's going on on the other side. I'm frozen, there's no more water. Its good. - We can't take it anymore. - Come back! - You don't understand the importance of what we live there. So... Wait for me here. I'll come back and get back to you. OK ? - What, are we staying here alone? - Alone? But you are three! - Guys, are you coming? - Good... Me, I'm going to see inside. - What ? - Wait, what? - They're excited. It must be crazy. I want a single day. - You suck here. Isn't that unique enough already? - Oh, relax. You have to wait, might as well go. - We walk around just a little bit, we come back and we go home. - Go ahead, Max. - What ? - You come ? - It goes quiet! (- Damn. Okay...) - Well, that's good. Wait, I'll help you. Pass your stuff. - Come on, Max. - Where is Lamia? Ah, there you go. So ! How are you ? - Yes why ? - Indeed... It's very recent here. Oh yes. - It'll be OK. - It was what ? - Someone there ? - Did you see that ? - It's crazy. - Hey, tourists! - Son of a bitch ! This day you will never forget. - Who's Spone? - His brother, right? Son of a bitch ! What is that ? - Ho! - Do not move. Do not move ! - Oh! - Come on, get something! - What ? I look for ! Son of a bitch ! - Stop ! - I found ! I'm coming. - What are you doing ? What do you do ? Son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! - Just go. Pull your leg. Yeah ! - Breathe, breathe. - It was what ? It was what ? - What is that ? What's this ? - Is that Spone's bag? - Yeah. - Breathe. It's okay, it doesn't look broken. - Shit. - He was there. - Wait 2 seconds and we'll go with you, okay? We have to get him out of here. Lamia, we don't know what's here. Lamia. Lamia! - Chut. It'll be OK. We will bring you back. Ramy blows. - We have to get him out of here. - We go to the other side and shoot. OK ? - Breathe, breathe. Breathe... Hush. Henry gasps. Henry, how are you? - What ? - Use the rope! - What ? - Keep shooting, Henry! - Shoot, on the other side! - Come on, come on, Henry! - Come on, Henry! - Do what he says! - We're all behind. - Tire ! - Do you see the end or not? - Can you shoot? - We try, it blocks. (- Damn.) - What is that? - Stuff is falling! - It's nothing, it's the subway. - It moves ! - Stuff is falling! - Why does it move like that? - Shoot me! - Pull forward, come on! - Shoot, shoot! - Advance ! - It's collapsing! - Hurry up ! - Come back ! Come back ! - Pull me there! - Drawn ! - Come back, we're shooting you! - Move ! - I can't speed up! Help me ! - Henry ? Henry. Breathe. Henry ! - Merci. Damn, thank you. - Faust! Guys ! Henry coughs. - They have something to clear? - They have the tools, but... Oh ! You hear me ? - It's been two hours. - There must be something wrong. Come, we... We'll try to find Lamia. - How to find her? Where do you want us to go? - I do not know, but there is another way out. - Are you doing alright ? - Yep I'm fine. Are you going to ask me ten times? - Okay, over there. - Lamia ! Lamia ! - Stop ! Stop. - What is this madness ? - Do we agree on what it is? A door slams and we shout in the distance. - What is this shit? (- Damn.) - It's getting closer, do we agree? - Attention ! - What is that ? - Come on, we're off! Go! Go! Go ! (*- I want to see what it is.) - Max, Ramy! (- What's this ?) Growls (*What the fuck is that?) *- Wait for it! (- Damn, damn, damn!) - Did you see something? - I... I... (- Attends.) - What do you see ? - I didn't film. I used the night shot to watch, but I didn't record. - Is this a joke? - Was there something? - So, tack... OK... - Ca va, Henry? - Okay, so... We went back that way. OK ? Then it was straight. - No, we went left. - No, otherwise, I wouldn't have made the line there. You must follow... There, it was on the right, and we just did that. The cat flap is there. We are in the middle of the white zone, I don't know where. Tac. There's one, two, three. Right. - Impossible. - I do not know. - The cat flap is there, isn't it? - I don't know where we are. We took it from there and we did this. - We took a left. - So if we follow... - Guys. - And your line? - Guys. - It's the old version. - Guys ! - QUOI ? - German. - I saw swastikas. Did you ever make it home? - Fuck it. - We're in a bunker. - What ? - The white area is a fucking German bunker. There must be an exit. It's over there. Let's go. - Fuck it. - Going down to get out, it's super logical. - Must try. - Son of a bitch... Guys ! Come to see. - OK... - Damn, there's a bed. I ask myself 5 minutes, I have too much pain. Oh... - They look so young... - You hear ? Oh fuck. - I found it. (- Son of a bitch...) Growl - Damn! What was that ? - Don't touch the door! - Was that Lamia? Was it her? Damn, answer! Was it Lamia? - We gotta get out of here. (- The last war was 39-45.) (39-45 was 46 years ago.) (Let's say he was 18.) (So ​​he would be 64.) (64 years old is possible. So there is someone here.) (Who lives here and doesn't know the war is over.) - Stop, look for a solution. - Uh... Sonia ? - Bingo. - We may have an idea for the cat flap. Do you have anything? - Yeah. Uh... A bayonet and some pervitine. - What is pervitin? And uh... And she still walks. - Oh ! Guys ! Damn, come see! - What's that smell? Son of a bitch ! - Well, that's why there are rats. - Oh fuck. - You hear ? It starts again. (- Oh, shit!) - Why does it sound? - You have to get out! We are leaving ! - Max, attends ! - Henry ! Henry hurle. Henry ! - Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Squeak Here ! Oh fuck. Oh ! Oh. *- Wow! *- Does it shave or not? *- Yeah, it shaves, yeah. *- Do you shave? Well yeah, it shaves. *- There is a hole. *- What ? *- There is a hole. *- Where ? *- Where you just passed. *- The ? *- Yes, there is a hole. *- Are you kidding me ? *- I can't help you. Why are you laughing ? * Stopped. Don't fucking laugh. * No, don't laugh, seriously. *I smell air. *- Son of a bitch. *- No, there's... * I do. *- You'll never make it. *- But you're a badger, man. *- Oh. * How many are left? *- Well yes, everything. * You did almost nothing. - You can't leave him here. - We can't take her. It won't pass. - Fuck it. We'll find another way. - There is not any. There is no other way. I am sorry. I do not know what to say. He won't last 10 meters. So we go out and we'll come back for it. - We'll be right back, Henry. We promise, we'll come back for you. - One. One! - I'll shoot. You hear ? I will shoot! One more step, I'll blow your brains out! I'll blow your brains out! - Attention ! - Damn... shitty Nazis! - Halt ! - Hey! Hey ... - Hey, shh. - Nope ! - Help me ! - Everything is fine. Calm down. Hush. What are you looking at? Look at me. Hush, hush, hush. Everything will be alright. Chut. - Don't, don't, don't! - Chut. - Help ! Help me ! Someone there ? Ho! Help ! Help me ! Ho! You hear me ? Help me !
