[INHALES DEEPLY] [EXHALES DEEPLY] [ENGINE RUMBLING] Good morning. I'm sorry. I'm, I'm sorry. It's no problem. Almost there, huh? Yes. Where'd you get on? Lincoln City. Oh. Would you like? No, no thank you. I can get you a cup out of the bathroom... [MOUTHS] Thank you. Sean. Helen. Home? Oh, yeah. Born and raised. Going home. Gulp. Five years ago, I left this town in a limo. If you're not ready, why are you coming back? My folks are getting a divorce. They're supposed to sign the papers on Thursday. What are you gonna do about it? I don't know. Whatever it takes, I guess. I mean, it just doesn't make any sense to me. They used to make us go out and play in a blizzard so they could jump each other's bones. Right. It's a lousy idea. They're adults, they know what they're doing. They're not gonna listen to me. Miracles happen every day. Right. Look at me... in my eyes. Okay. [♪♪♪] Wow, how do you do that? I'm nearsighted. It will happen. It might not be your folks. It might be peace of mind. It might be finding your one true love. My one true love? Yes. She's out there somewhere, just waiting for you. Just waiting. Now kiss me one more time... Your minor miracle is about to happen. [♪♪♪] [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] Hey! Let go of me. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought... What? Denise? CURTIS: What's going on here? No. Nothing. He-he thought I was somebody else. I'm very sorry. It's all right. Hey, Dad. Hey, baby. Oh... If only your mother were here to see you now. LENA: She is here. CURTIS: Yeah. Oh, oh... Hey, Dad. Sydney. Uh... You're looking good. Oh, well, you too. Oh, you think so? Not too provocative for you? Not too "sleazy?" Well, for me, maybe. For you... That was too easy. And how's your back? Oh... It must be fine. He's got his weapon. Damn straight. And I've bet you've been practicing. Give me a break. They've got me running 24 hours a day. I haven't been anywhere near a bowling alley in over a year. Besides, it's not my priority to spend time worrying about kicking your butt in the alley. Oh, and how often? Once a week. At least. Well... That it? Yeah, that's it. I couldn't check it. It's still the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Well, we need to get it to the tailor's right away... Lena... ...we have to make sure the... ...stop obsessing. It's gonna fit you like a glove. Wanna see? No, not here, Daddy. Yes, she does. No, I don't. Not here. Yes, she does. Would you please show it to her? I keep telling her it's not green. She's been driving me crazy for the past month. And now you get to deal with her. Hey... [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Okay? Perfect. I called the Holiday Inn, and they tell me they got plenty of room... Daddy, I told you we made other arrangements. [MOUTHS] No. That's it. Yes, Daddy, you're staying in my room. Oh. Well, thank you, baby. I expect you to respect my privacy. Please, I don't have to go through your closets to know you're a heathen. Are you guys gonna do this all week? I mean, I'm getting married on Saturday. Are we forgetting our promises, is that what we're doing now? [♪♪♪] ROSE: Bullet of the night, of the love songs we all knew, born of winter snow. DYLAN: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go, take over. Yeah? DYLAN: Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Um... Levitating spear, clouds, puffy, puffy on high, ate the whole rainbow. Wow. Definitely true art. Go, go, more. Come on. Microwave attack. Sizzle, pop, sizzle, sizzle. Beat a path, buster. Whew! Do you know where she is? Did she call in yet? Who? Rachel. No. That's it. She's out of here. Hang on. She might have had some kind of emergency. Like what? I don't know. Beat a path, buster. All right, what's the story? Where is she? Who? What happened? I, uh...What? She didn't call in? Is she sick? No, she was fine when she left this morning. Oh man, you are really something else. I have known this girl for six months. She has been like clockwork. So, come on, tell me what happened? She said it, didn't she? Did she say it? Yeah. Yeah. Oh man. Oh, man! So, what does this mean? Does she mean this is over? Hey, Dad. Wow! Sean! Oh, he's back. Hey Percy! Man, I can't believe this! Hey, whoa! Look at you, boy... Oh... ROSE: What is going...? [EXCLAIMING] Mom, oh... Oh, wow, look at you. Yeah, look at you. You look beautiful. Well, shut-up. What do you mean shut up? She looks great, doesn't she? She always looks great. Where the hell did you come from? When did you get here? I got here just now. I took a cab in from the airport. Mister Richardson sent me up with his pilot. In the Lear? It was nice.Wow! How is it? It is great. I'm back. I'm on a rehab assignment in Dominican. Yes! Yes! It is really good. Oh God! PERCY: So good to see you! I don't believe this. Is that you? Me? This is Sean. I know. We met. Oh, no. We never met. I would have remembered that if I have remembered anything else in the rest of my life. I just flew in today. In a Lear. Oh, the pitcher, heard a lot about you. And you are? ROSE: Not available. Lena is getting married on Saturday. The most beautiful bride this town has ever seen for a very long time. Welcome home, superstar. Come on, you look hungry. Come into the kitchen. Come see everything we've done. I got this new bread pan, the size of a baseball mitt. You won't believe it. Hey, you guys, he's home. Yeah, Sean! ROSE: ...set fire to the neighbor's cat. SEAN: Mom... Punched out a kid his first day of preschool. This is character assassination. I don't believe them. Thank you. You're not that kind of guy. That's right. The moment I met you, I knew you were a no nonsense, straight ahead, Lear jet flying kind of guy. [CHUCKLES] If only I weren't engaged. Well, it's not too late to change your mind. I prefer men that ride the bus. Can I get you guys some coffee? Oh, no, we're fine now. You go on. I have time, and I'm enjoying this. PERCY: I'll have some coffee. Decaf. Rat poison... What charm school did she go to? What's the matter, dear? Dish it out, can't take it? The Rose looks great. Yeah, it's-it's-it's nice. Good. I kind of miss the big screen T.V. though. So does your father. Business is booming. Cold cash beats Monday night football any day, right, Dad? In the real world... Wait a minute. He looks skinny. He's here to save the day. I know. You all right? I'm good. You? Mm-hm. What you got? Hey, now is there something in here that is going to bite me? No, Mom. Sean? No. Oh, look at this. Funny Girl. [BOTH LAUGH] I saw it in the Dominican. I liked it better in Spanish. Is this one in Spanish? No. She drove him to it. PERCY: "He was a rogue. A low-life, gambling, scoundrel snake with no idea how lucky he was to have this woman." ROSE: Was she still a bitch in Spanish? [BOTH LAUGH] PERCY: Oh look at this! Oh, no. Come on, come on, break it out. Like he's got a chance. Why don't you guys come over some night next week, I'll fix you both dinner. One night. Let's make it firm. I came all this way to buy B and O Railroad and I-- I know how tough it is to coordinate schedules. Tomorrow? Um... Wednesday? What? Well, I'm not sure. Neither am I. Let's see, we'll just, we'll play it by ear. Play it by ear. Play it by ear. Yeah... Sure. [♪♪♪] FRANKLIN: Come on, come on, come on! We're illegal already. Break a record. Over there... There he is, man. Come on, right? We'll get there. Are you crazy? You touched my stick. You touched my stick! This time, right?! Mister Valens, I'm Lieutenant Paul. I'm here to help you, sir. [PHONE RINGING] But I can only help if you cooperate. Hello? LENA [ON PHONE]: How'd they look? What? Lena? Oh, where are you? In the chopper? SYDNEY [ON PHONE]: Yeah. LENA: Are you live? SYDNEY: No. LENA: Oh, well look, I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later. That's all right. What's up? I was checking if you went to the bridal-- Can you get a choker for me? Down, man, come on! Get me closer! John Carlo, get closer. I'm sorry. What? The dresses. You were supposed to go see the dresses. Oh, I didn't. But I can stop by before dinner. No, that's, that's okay. I'll-I'll take care of it. Well, hold on a second. Are you two gonna get this shot for me or what? On the bottom. You're killing me, babe. Oh, shut up! Don't make me go off. Don't make him go off. Go to hell. You flat top, I want you to die! I want you to dive, you understand that? I want you to dive, dive, dive, dive, dive! Go ahead, take this, take that. You got it? Dive, dive, dive, dive, dive. Dive! All right. Thank you. I'm back. Sorry. What's going on? SYDNEY: Oh, some burned out dock worker who had too many donuts is about to jump off a crane. I can hear him. No. That's Franklin. How is the apartment? It sucked. Nine-twenty five for a glorified single. SYDNEY: Does the fact you guys can't find an apartment mean that you aren't meant to be together? Bye. Bye, sweetie. Come on, Lena, I can hear it in your voice. What's wrong? I'm fine. I'm fine. WOMAN: I need your help, guys. I really do. [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [DOORBELL RINGS] Pluto, Edith's here. [DOG BARKS] Hi. Hey. Hi. Hey you. [MEOWS] Come on in. You want some coffee? No, thanks. I'm going back to my computer. Today's paper? On the coffee table. See, Brute. See? I told you he'd be here. Are you satisfied now? Yeah. Don't you miss your Edith? Huh? [TRILLS] You think it's over? What? Baseball? Yes. Does he know it? Yes. Yes... [WOMAN VOCALIZING] Give me your soul, sweet thing. Your voice wafts through shadows and light. Suspends on a worn out wing tip and disappears in the wind. [WIND WHISTLING] Ouch. Look at the craters in those doggies. In my former life, I was a king. Everything was going fine until they chopped off my head and put it on display in the center of town... Yo, Percy. What are you doing back here tonight? Jet lag. Got a cold one? Got some ID? DYLAN: ...found a woman to love me, and it was all over when we took a honeymoon cruise on the Titanic. What is this guy doing? DYLAN: Life number three was a three ring circus... That guy is paying the bills. These are his followers. DYLAN: Some kid moving along... This guy stinks. ...in sneakers... Your mother doesn't think so. She hired him? Yeah. And they've become good friends. Friends? ...sure... his steps are smooth. Yeah, his steps may be a little too sure about the street. 'Cause her steps are cautious, her steps are... Excuse me. ...she knows what he wants and she's not gonna give it to him. You have to talk to me. I don't want to talk to you. You have to talk to me. ...kiss her goodbye and just walk on down the street. Yeah, here you come... Oh! Yeah... I am not a pushy broad! I mean, we agreed. I know. Okay, it was my fault. Excuse me for having feelings! Excuse me! My mom warned me, this town stinks! Darling, you are a beautiful woman. With a tremendous heart and the spirit of men, when I'm waltzing with a treasure of men more worthy than I... Kiss my ass! Please. I could've been somebody, Charlie. [SINGERS VOCALIZING] I could have had class. I could have been a basket or a hat. Instead I'm drenched in this rotting garbage getting stepped on by every shoe and every foot and every sneaker all day long. Just another day in the life of a doormat, baby. I'm here to stay. ALL: Hey, hey, hey... [ALL SNAPPING] Where were you?! Huh? I waited for you for three hours. What are you talking about? Okay, no, no, no, no, no. What do you want from me, huh? You know, it's a two way street out here. You have to join in. You have to partake. Please, we have to talk about this! It's my baby too! WOMAN: What? What? That's what you think. [CROWD EXCLAIMS] Oh, oh... Thank you, God. [CROWD LAUGHS] Thank you, thank you. Oh, she's mad. You are some piece of work, huh? I guess the rat poison went to my head. You listen to me, mister. I never lie. And you had me lie to some very good friends of mine, and I don't appreciate it one bit. What are you Catholic? They don't need the grief. Especially now. I think I know what my folks need, thanks very much. Never? Never what? Never lie? You never told a lie? Do you have a point? I'm just asking. Maybe I'm in the presence of the only perfect human being on the planet. You know, maybe after God painted your face, he gave you a heart to match. Or maybe you're just lying to yourself. Which is it? Look, Slick, I don't know you. I don't wanna know you. And what I do is my business. Now who is Denise? Denise? What Denise? Yeah, that's what I thought. What? You said that you thought I was Denise. Oh, yeah, that Denise. She's an old classmate of mine. Oh, right. You're right. [♪♪♪] When I saw you there and you seemed to know me, I thought you were my minor miracle. I didn't know you were my wakeup call... [SAXOPHONE PLAYING SOULFUL MELODY] Is she up there? Mm-hm. Parole. He's on parole! He's just out of a rehab, waiting for a sex change operation. There is no "he," I'm telling you. There's always a "he." You just don't know him. She stashed him away from you because she's embarrassed. Look at the crap she's reading! Could be mine. Love's Lusty Longings? Well, no. But some of that trash is mine. As a matter of fact, Longingsis next on my list. She in therapy? Curtis. I'm serious. Your sister needs help. Give her some credit. She pulled her life together pretty damn well, if you ask me. Well, it's a good thing you're gonna be a lawyer, 'cause she's gonna need you. You gonna try your tux on or not? Yeah, look at that. Uh-uh. Try your tux on first, and then we'll add the finishing touches. Okay, okay, okay. Oh... Say, maybe I oughta get me a new tux, huh? Not another dime. Oh, it's my dime. Your tux is great. Well, maybe great's not good enough. Besides, have you heard? High school principals just got a raise. I'm making almost minimum wage now. I'm a cash cow. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Gotta look good when you're dancing with an angel. [WAITER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I just picked up my last check. She fired you? I quit. I thought it would be the easiest for all concerned. I'm sorry I lost it yesterday. I don't know where that came from. It was uncalled for. No, I, uh, I was flattered, I-I am flatt-- WAITRESS: Four square divided by what...? [SIGHS] Got a hankerin'. Oh, sweetie, I can't. I called over there. They got it. Banana ripple mocha fudge? Double scoop on a sugar cone. My treat. [EXCLAIMS] No, no, I'm driving. [LAUGHS] What? Oh, it's just a... [CLEARS THROAT] Madam. It's a beauty, huh? I rented it for the week. Mom, what are you doing?! I'm trying to count. This is not cute. This is not clever, or funny, or even very nice! I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, but your father and I are not some chick you can dazzle with some crap and a smile! If you have something to say, you say it. Be open. Don't play games. [SIGHS] Nostalgia is not gonna make everything okay. Look, I just thought you'd like riding in one again. Your father's Mustang didn't look this good when it was new. Why? Why can't you work things out? I can't live with him anymore, and he can't live with me. That's all. We came to the end of the line. It happens. I don't buy it. The fight to stay in love got old. We couldn't put up our dukes anymore. We didn't want to. Ever since we've separated, we've been better, much better. We're a family. All of us. That's not gonna change. You're different. I've never been more myself. Where's my ice cream? [SIGHS] So are you dating? I've had dates. With who? Men. I'm not telling you. Well, older men, younger men? Okay, look I-I hear you. It's a new start for you. I want you to be happy. I'm-I'm just-- I'm just wanting to be part of it, to be open. So come on. Younger. All of them? You have a problem with that? There haven't been that many. Where'd you meet them? [SCOFFS] No, no... I'm-I'm not ready for this. I don't wanna be open. You mean, sex. You, Mom, are you having sex with them? Does the radio in here work? Mom... What?! No, I am not gonna answer any more questions. I'm your mother. I have a right to... To what? ...to-to-to not answer any more questions. There will be no more questions today... [♪♪♪] [SINGER VOCALIZING] ♪ Your mama loves you ♪ ♪ Yes, she does ♪ ♪ Gives you lots Of hugs and kisses ♪ Get some later? Okay... Oh, yes. I'll have one of those. Go ahead. No, one of these. Can he borrow yours? Any time. See, Dad. Reggie's ready. What's your problem...? In about a year, you are gonna have a little cousin... You're late. It took me a couple of hours to find this stuff. Looks good. Yeah, well, it feels ridiculous. Hey, a little over the top? Nope. And don't hold back either. His worst nightmare. I didn't know you were vindictive. Oh, come on. If I didn't do something outrageous, he wouldn't know it was me. Yeah, right. [SINGER CONTINUES VOCALIZING] Syd. Franklin? This is my lover. Oh. Very sexy. Assalamu alaikum, my brother, wassup. [LAUGHS] You, my brother, come on in. A little dog, went right up on me then... Hi everybody. This is Franklin Brown. The man in my life. [ALL GREET INDISTINCTLY] What's up? Yo, what's up? Hey, Franklin... You want some more, baby? Oh, yeah. I'm hungry. Come on. Come on, there. Yeah, that I am. Ah... No, good, good... FRANKLIN: With the equivocation of the expeditious perpetrators on Capitol Hill, we are summized. Right. They know. And they know we know, constigating their mess down our throats. Damn right. But it ain't gonna matter in '96, 'cause in '96, hey, we're out of here. To where? Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. Homeland for the people. Israel with a beat. You out of your mind? Well, well, well, did I leave something out? I mean, we'll be promigating the situation for the world, baby. And I promise, I'm gonna take care of her, Dad. WOMAN: Oh, he better take off those glasses so he can see the real world. Do you lie, Reggie? What? No, I never told you any lie. Oh, I know. But I mean, do you lie in life? You know, everybody lies, but do you like it? I don't know. I mean... I guess it's cool, if you can get away with it. Right. Let's do it right here. What do you mean? What, now? Right now. Baby... No, wait, wait, wait. Wait, honey. What's wrong? [SCOFFS] We're not alone. We're engaged. [SIGHS] Lena, this is crazy... All right, all right. Screw 'em all. Let's-let's-let's fool around. Come on. No. I'm not in the mood now. What's wrong? Look, I'm sorry. All right? I mean, you caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting it. It wasn't a-a Lena move. Well, you don't know everything about me. Don't assume you know everything about me. I'm not that predictable. Oh, yeah, right? You're just a regular wild woman, huh? Yeah. Who knows what you might do next? That's right. Yeah, why should I even have a clue? I mean, I've only known you my whole life. And another thing, don't discuss having children with my father before talking to me. Unless, of course, you wanna have them with him. Oh see, now you're trippin'. I'm out of here... [♪♪♪] [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] WOMAN: Nice car. Yeah... [♪♪♪] I called, no answering machine wasn't on. Hell, I even drove by her house, her car wasn't there. I don't know. Maybe I should try to contact her parents. I... You met them? No. Where do they live? I don't know. Good man. Did you guys ever have conversations? Sometimes. What did you do to this girl? Well, I didn't say I love you. No, before that. She cracked 'em one by one. She was always meticulous. She's not crazy. She's young... Hell, yes, you can handle it. Absolutely! Sean said Rose is seeing somebody. I didn't know that. Neither did I. Sean said it's some young guy. Good for her. Huh? Yeah. Absolutely! Well, I gotta be goin'. Now don't worry. She made her statement. She got her anger out there with the eggs. Yeah, she probably went to visit her, you know, mother or something. Exactly. I found this in the storage room. It's got your name on it. I think it's from Rachel. Is it ticking?! WAITRESS: Oh, what is it?! We don't know! Stand still. I'm standing still. Oh, good. Could be digital. Let's get out of here. It's not beeping. It's not heavy. It's kind of heavy. It's bigger than a bread box. I don't think it's gonna blow up. It's not a bomb. Well, you know, maybe we should let the experts decide. You gotta be kidding me. Looks like a gift. Rachel was in love with you, the ignorant child. It is not a bomb. All right, all right, well, go ahead and open it. It's got your name on it... All right... Wait! Don't pull that! Nobody told you to go and... I love it. Who would have known she had a sense of humor. Disgusting. A good likeness. Nice hat. Hey, sweet thing, what can I get for 20 bucks? MAN: He said he was gonna meet us right here. You wanna party? [GASPS] Sister, I-I, think that was one of our altar boys. I thought so. Oh, hail Mary... [GASPS] HOOKER: So sue me... That's right! That's right! One, please. MAN 1: So give me back my money. MAN 2: I'm sorry there are no refunds. No refunds. Just get out of here. LENA: Is that real popcorn? Sure. No butter? Want some? No, thank you. Ahem. JOE [IN FILM]: Tell him I stopped by. WOMAN [IN FILM]: No, wait, Joe. Please, don't leave. Huh? I'm so lonely. Mrs. Jenkins, what's wrong? JENKINS: I've got no life. JOE: I know. JENKINS: Don't you like me, Joe? JOE: Sure. You're Rick's mom. JENKINS: Come now. Let's sit, have a chat. Roast some marshmallows. JOE: I-I've really gotta go. I'm late for the mall. [JENKINS SIGHS] I'm burning up, Joe. Oh... What about Mister Jenkins? [CHUCKLES] It's the annual Moosehead weekend. JOE: Wow, those are great. JENKINS: Oh, yes. Touch me, Joe. Are you sure? Right now, Joe! Okay. Yes, Joe... Oh, Mrs. Jenkins. Oh... Mrs. Jenkins... [SIGHING] Yes, Joe, yes... How you doing? How you doing? Coming to see me? You're Dylan, right? I didn't recognize you. Sorry. I've only seen you on stage. Yeah, well, I saw you the day you came home. I found your address... Why did you stop by? Your place is... Oh, we, uh-- We passed my place. You got a minute? I'd like to talk to you. Well, should we go inside or you wanna just clear some space out here, fifty paces. [CHUCKLES] [DOOR CLOSES] Can I get you something? Some water, juice? Nothing. It's a great place. Thank you. You're a-- You're very talented. [SCOFFS] You hate my work. I saw you Monday night. I see every face, and I remember the eyes. But you were right. I wasn't very good Monday night. People loved it. But you didn't come over here to talk to me about my work. You came over here to talk to me about your work. My work? To save the marriage. Look, my parents are grown now. They're very happy. I'm not trying to get in the middle of that. But you're wondering if I'm sleeping with your mother. You know, fifty paces might be a good idea. Well, what did she tell you? She didn't tell me anything. She mentioned she had been dating younger men. Not too many of those in town. I know you're close. Look, I love your mother. Oh, this wasn't a good idea. She's my best friend. I'm not ready for this. And as such, it's not my place to describe the nature of our relationship with her son. If she wants to confide in you, she'll-- Oh, shut-up! Are you doing it, yes or no? No! No?! Yes. Don't start with me. What do you wanna hear? I want the truth! Whose truth? Who is she messing around with? Maybe she's not messing around with anybody. Well, she said she was dating. Oh. Well, then, I guess I know how your dates end up. Not enough of them. [SIGHS] You want me as an enemy? If it's necessary. It might be fun. Might be. But no punching, okay? Cool. Cool. Yo. Baseball? That's right, pal. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Man... Hey, sweet thing. You miss me? Percy said you wanted to see me? Yes, I did. Hi. Hi. I didn't want to interrupt you while you were working. Yeah, I'm on a 15. I had a few calls to make, so... Oh, okay. Well, I promise this will only take a second of your infinitely valuable time. I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions. You're not still angry at me. Are you still angry at me? Is that your first question? What's the deal with Dylan and my mother? What's what deal? What do you mean? Are they doing it? Doing what? Speak English. Spell it out for me. You're a bitch. Am I? Well, I don't know what Dylan and your mom are doing. Okay? And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. What difference does it make anyway? My folks are breaking up. Okay? You understand that? Ted and Rose are breaking up. They sign the papers tomorrow. What the hell is going on around here? This isn't a game. Okay? This is it. There's lifetimes on the line here, and-and-and I can't seem to get anyone to... To what? To what?! To stop and say I love you. I'm sorry. Let's just kiss and make-up and forget all this crap and get back together again! You know, to find it again. Ted and Rose! I'm sorry. It breaks my heart too, Sean, but I think it's over. Well, I'm sorry. I totally flipped. I don't know what Dylan and your mom are doing. I know they're friends. Well, she's gonna need friends. She's got lots of friends. I'm her friend. Good. You're all right. You're not a bitch. I'm aspiring. You've got a bright future. [♪♪♪] SEAN: Dad? Dad? [MEOWS] Hey, Dad. What, you-you woke up and you decided you're not gonna do this. It's already done. Feels fine. Huh? You don't feel anything? I feel everything, and it feels fine. You know, you and Mom...

He tried to act like it didn't happen, and then later on, he burped. Daddy burped? Loud? Didn't even cover his mouth. I think he's starting to like this guy. Get out of here. I swear to God.

Don't. That was a pretty clumsy way to tell you, but it was my first time. You haven't told your family? You're it. Oh... Look, um... the weird part is I don't have words to tell you what it's like. I mean, not yet, anyhow. But all I know is I'm not sad. You know, not anymore. And I can see so much better now. Everything. Everything's so-- So bright and so clear..

What happened last night was a huge mistake. No, it wasn't. It was the most important night of my life. I-I-I don't drink. I never drink. And I never lose control. Oh, welcome to the human race. You seduced me. What? You took advantage of my pre-nuptial panic. Hey, baby, you were driving the car. I was not. Okay, maybe I was a little interested. Maybe. But you didn't have to...forget it. It was just sex. Sex? It-it was justsex? Don't be modest. You know, let me tell you something. That-that-that...What we had last night was beyond sex. It was ultra sex. You-you were amazing. And you were so vocal. I was loud? Yeah, yeah, I mean, but I knew how you felt because we were gone. We were out of there. Hmm. It was ambrosia. Yeah, well, you're leaving town soon. One for the road. No! Huh? Was I good? Goodbye. Did you? Okay. Maybe I did once or twice. So what? You're not gonna get a trophy for it, and they're not gonna put you on the Wheaties box for it, Mister Baseball. Besides, it happens all the time. It's no big deal. I have to go. Well, in-in case you change your mind, you know where to find me. Going out of town sale, two for one?... [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] [♪♪♪] Industrial strength... [SNORES] Oh... Oh... Oh... [RINGING] Hello... Oh, hey, baby. [WOMAN GASPING] We gonna talk now, or are you just gonna breathe some more, huh? [SCOFFS] Come on Rachel, this is ridiculous. Will you talk to me? [SCREAMS] Lose the hat. [GASPING] [SCREAMS] Lose the hat. You? Me. She met some guy named Bruce the day after you dumped her. She took him to some motel in the mountains where she's been hibernating deliciously, not thinking about you for one second. Get a grip. Get a life. Grow up. MAN: Ow! [CHEERING] SEAN: Come on, what happened? TED: Last night? No, last year. Yes. Last night. Did she clean your clock? Oh, you wanna hear one of my stories now, huh? I should be charging you. Oh, really, so, you-you did it. And all the way. You had sex with this woman? Well, is that so hard to believe? I still got one, you know. But I wasn't wasting it on some very young, very foolish little girl with questionable taste. Here. Thanks, anyway. No, I had another drink and walked home. Beat you back here, as a matter of fact. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Who'd you go home with last night? Me? No, just hung for a while. Right... Do you like lying to me or is it just a habit? Oh, no, come on, I'd tell you... FRANKLIN: Tempo. Tempo. Pick up the tempo. [PIANO PLAYING] Yeah, there you go. That's a good idea, Franklin. Yeah. You know. All right, now look. Now they'll walk in, and-and looking good. And, and people are sweatin' and fannin' themselves like it's the Fourth of July. And that woman over there, she's got a catcher's mitt, 'cause she's waiting for that bouquet. And the old folks sittin' over here, smilin' and thinking about all the mistakes they made in their lives, and you're feelin' that feelin' that you're feelin', 'cause you know you're gonna be with somebody tonight. Oh, it's a magical day! A glorious day! Oh, hallelujah! Oh, yeah. I'm floatin' on air! Just tiptoeing down the aisle! Oh, yes! Oh, after you. ["BRIDAL CHORUS" PLAYING] That's low. I was just playing my part. Oh, you're over the top. So, I made a mistake. You touched me. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] FRANKLIN: That was not the mistake. It's something I should've done three years ago when I saw you for the first time and realized you needed me. Needed you. Yeah, that's right. And now you got me. I'm not interested in you, Franklin. Nothing to worry. Yeah, right. All, right, that's cool. No, problem. All right? I'm backed off. Not interested. Please, drop it. Okay? Hey, where'd you get those lips from, huh? Have mercy. Hey, goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, son. Goodnight, baby. [♪♪♪] Hi. What are you doing in here? You can't be in here. This is a house of God. We didn't do it. Okay? You-you were, you were upset and-and you weren't yourself. Or maybe you were. I don't know. And now I'm wondering what the hell I was thinking, letting my one shot get away. Thank you. I'm a jerk. You pegged me right. I've been skating all my life. But last night I had to stop for the first time and be real. I don't know you yet, but so far, you're way out of my league. Do you love him? All my life. And now? Yes, now. I love him very much. Like a friend or...? Sean, it's done. I'd like to come to your wedding. You're invited. Lena, they gave me my unconditional release. My arm's gone. My arm's been gone. Baseball's over. So it's a new day for me too. So let's make it a good one. [BELL RINGING] One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three... You don't need to practice. You're perfect. You will always be my best girl. You know that, don't you? You just tell Old Reggie where to put my place for Christmas dinner. Okay? And if you ever need me, for any reason, I'm there. Even if I have to fly. I need you to stop me from making the biggest mistake of my life. Oh, psyched, right? I know what you're saying. I'm not ready. Oh, honey, you're just a little nervous right now. No. You serious? Sydney. No! Yeah. It's me. I can't get married. I don't know what I'm doing. Reggie's a wonderful person, but how can I give him a wife when I don't even know who she is. Ridiculous! I told you not to move in with her! You didn't listen to me. You moved in with her anyway, and now you're as big a fool as she is! This is not about Sydney. Okay, okay. So Reggie is not Mister Excitement. But he's solid. This is not about Reggie. Well, what the hell is it about? It's about me waking up every day at 6:45 a.m. It's about sensible shoes and thrift stores. It's about-- It's about me doing my homework and all my friends are out partying. I-I-I can't do this anymore. It's all crap! All right, all right, all right, all right, maybe you're a little upset now. And maybe you're a little crazy. But it'll pass! All you have to do is just get through this moment. I can't wait anymore. I gotta stop this. Honey, you-- You have built this in-incredible foundation for a life. I've watched you do it. I helped you do it. Now, you wanna throw all that away? I don't want that life. That's not my life. That's somebody else's life. I'm just a good liar. What do you want? I don't know what I want. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't know what I want, because I'm so busy trying to make everybody else happy. Oh, so it's all my fault. Daddy, don't go there with me right now. I am not gonna hurt for you. I can't wear Mama's dress. Not for you. Not for Reggie. Not for anybody. I need you to understand that. You gotta understand that. Well, I don't, I don't. I think you are making a terrible mistake here. Okay. Maybe, maybe I am. But I gotta do this because... I'm dying inside. And I know whatever is left in me is just gonna die. So, what am I supposed to do now? Nothing. Hmm. It's my mistake, and I will deal with it. I just need a minute. I need a minute so I can think about what to tell Reggie... [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN: Hi, Rose. [BELL RINGING] Reg... Hey... My God, you look beautiful. Thank you. Listen, baby, I-I know, I know this is bad luck, I'm sorry, but... I wanted to talk to you. Okay. See, I don't know... Well, I have to ask you one thing. Are you sure about this? Aren't you? I'm just a little bit nervous. Reggie? Why are you here? You came in here to tell me you're calling this off? No, no, Lena, no... Now? With 200 people out there waiting. Baby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to get upset and I didn't mean for you to get angry. Why did you wait until the last minute like you always do? Would you, honey...? You could have called me. You could have talked to my father. You didn't have to do it... Lena! [LAUGHING] All right, what, what, what? [SIGHS] I was gonna come and talk to you too. I can't get married. I'm not ready. Baby girl... I'm scared. Oh, girl, I know, I know. I'm scared too. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, baby. I'm not ready either. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] I love you. I love you too. Yeah, I love you. Uh... Lena and I have decided not to get married today. We know this comes as a shock to everyone, and we apologize. But we realized, just this morning, that we're not ready. And it's better to wait than to risk hurting each other. [GUESTS MURMURING] But, we might as well still have the party. Huh? WOMAN: Yeah, something... If anyone's in the mood to get married... MAN: Don't look at me... Sydney! Franklin, no. Hallelujah! Oh, come to me, my Nubian babushka. Franklin, you stay away from me. Stop right there. Sydney, my love, let's reverberate in the stratosphere of nocturnal rainbows as we cut and pick the meaning of life. I wanna spend the rest of my life fortifying your oats. Oh, please, please, my sweet chocolate drop, will you marry me? Do you cook? Anything you want. Do you do windows? All around the house. [WOMAN 1 EXCLAIMS] Will you marry me? Nope. WOMAN 2: Rejected!
