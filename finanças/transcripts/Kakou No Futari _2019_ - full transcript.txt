Hello? Is that Kenji?! Dad? What's up? Naoko's getting married. The ceremony is in August, on the 26th. Chasudo Hotel, from 10:00. Heh? They asked for your address to send you the invite. In the meantime, Her dad asked me to give you the date and time. Can you come? You busy right now? Huh? Uh, well. Kinda. I'll make my way up there around that time. Alright, got it. Okay then. Bye. Who's there? Naoko What?! Hurry up and open the door. Hey, you! Do you know what time it is right now!? What happened to your hair? Well, you know. And the piercings? Well, you know! Something bad happen and you cut it after some deep reflection? Hold on. How did you know I was here? I heard from Nobuko. Nothing has changed since back then, huh. It's like a museum of Aunt Ika's stuff. This place... Make yourself at home, why don't you? Well I've been coming here since way back then. Mom died, and auntie took over parenting me. Your old man had a lot of night shifts for JR, huh. Until you up and went to Tokyo for college. Four years. Mom wasn't around anymore but I gained an older brother. Nobuko really keeps this place clean, huh? She's really something, too, huh? The electric and gas are still running, right? Even so, I don't think Uncle Isa hasn't come back even once. And, you know, last year he quit teaching high school and he's been teaching old folks with Nobuko at her calligraphy school. Yeah, I heard. That Nobuko is making amends, huh. Hey. Since, well, she stole Uncle from another woman, right? After my mom died, they had a chance meeting and tried to go out. At least that's what I was told. I doubt it Right after the first anniversary of death, they got married. I think it started when mom was in the hospital with cancer. Auntie is always by herself, huh? If neither you nor uncle will take her I guess I will take care of auntie. It's been a while since I drank your coffee. When was the last time we drank coffee together? How would I remember that? Hey. I gotta go shopping now, come with me! It's not like you're busy, right? And lunch is on me, okay! Okay! - This! - Hm. It's just sitting here so can I take it? - Eh? - Nice, right? My mom made it herself, you know. Well, it'll be my wedding gift from auntie. Whatever you want to think. I always kinda liked it, actually. It'll match my new place. - What? - Huh? Here. Goddammit. What? What happened? I was really hoping to get this deal for a 48" TV with a Blu-Ray recorder. But I wasn't even close to on time. My co-worker said you should line up while it's still dark out I guess she was right. Just the first five people, huh? What's that? A numbered ticket. I couldn't get that deal, but You can get a 50" deal for a little more money. Since I have this ticket at least I can get that deal. So you were planning to fit that TV and Blu-Ray thing in this car? Uh, yeah. That's why I brought you. Ugh. Delivery is expensive. And it wouldn't get there in time for the wedding! What time does this place open? Hm? 8:00. That's an hour from now, man! We wait. Ugh. Your big lunch for me is just ramen? You can order extra noodles. I'm fine with the regular size. At the funeral you said you'd reached your limit with that kind of work, so you quit being a nursery school teacher? Yeah. What are you doing now? I've just been doing a part-time job. Hm? But you just said you're working at a company? It's really nothing special. Because they know my dad, they let me become a kind of contracted worker. It's kinda like a sub-company of a sub-company of East Japan Railways. So What work are you doing? I'm just doing desk work. - What about you? - Me? You got divorced, and quit your job you got hired by your college buddy to work at his printing company? At least that's what I heard at the second memorial ceremony, anyway. The company went bankrupt soon after that. It was because of the earthquake. How come? Is there some connection between printing and radiation? The paper mills at Ishinomi and Hachinomi went under. Also, things going from paper to computers seemingly overnight... the printing world was already gasping for air. Then the tsunami disaster happened Orders decreased Not enough money to handle orders we did get. The electricity shortage Plus, the cost of electricity going up in 2011 We had no choice but to give up. The company collapsed a year after I was hired. Here you go: shoyu ramen and tantanmen. Thank you very much. Let's see how this tastes... Huh? Ah, here it is. So, what about now? Pu-taro. *A person with no job You've just been hanging out unemployed for four years?! That's why you can be here for ten days up to the wedding. Well I work some part time once in a while. Like what? Like directing traffic at construction sites. - You, directing traffic?! - Yeah. Not a good look. I don't want to see that. You don't have to see. Why don't you come back here and live at home? Free rent, too. Even if I come home You'll be married. What? The national defense forces? How? My co-worker introduced us. Single at 40 is suspicious. He's not divorced like you are. That's why it's suspicious. He's a stand-up and wonderful person. Totally different from you. If he's a major at 40 he could become a general. Nice job getting engaged to such an elite soldier. Seriously. I'm really thankful. But as an elite graduate from military academy, he'll need to go to HQ in Ichigaya when he has to go off for a duty or mission He might have to move all over the country... Hmm, you think so? I don't like Tokyo anymore. - Hey, Ken. - Hm? If it's okay I wonder if we can stop at my house. That's fine with me, but... My bad, heh, taking all your time. I need to use the restroom. Pardon the intrusion. Come on in. Just you and your dad in this big house for seven years. Yup. Without a spouse or a steady job. Yup, that's right. Good-ole Naoko! Since you love hot dogs so much I've always thought of you as a child. What? Is the beer for me? I'll drive the rest of the night. You just need to carry the TV to the bedroom. Thanks for helping. I'll be upstairs sorting out some things. There's more beer in the fridge. Help yourself. Got it. I'm coming in. - You know... Oh! Ken. You were sleeping, too? I woke up at five this morning. And you drank beer. What else was there for me to do? I don't want to have an accident from sleepy driving. Right before I get married. You're the one who gave me the beer! You're kind of a lightweight now, huh. Did you get your things sorted? All done? Yeah, basically. Oh. There's something interesting on top of that desk. The black thing on top. Bring it here. Huh? Naoko. You were still hanging on to this kind of thing? You were 25. I had just turned 20. Two years after moving to Tokyo. You know, Naoko. You wanted to go to the school for early childhood education in Takadanobaba and made your way to Tokyo. Even though there's already a ton of those schools in Akita and Sendai. It's obvious I just wanted to be by your side. That's why I rented an apartment right next to your company housing. Why am I saying that just now? I knew that at the time, it's just... I I was scared. Scared of what? To become like, you know, with you. I asked you at the beginning if you were scared. Do you remember what you said? I muttered, "I'm happy". Here. I was about to leave the apartment, not wearing any underwear. Because you told me to. Why did you keep this? What were you planning to do if the old man found it? Have you completely forgotten about those days? Those days? Those days from those days. This is the only thing I have though. I haven’t forgotten but it's not something I think about. Hmm? - You haven't thought about me either? - That's right. Well, have you thought about my body? What are you saying? While looking at this album I thought deeply about your body. Don't say such weird things at a time like this! It's not weird. You don't get any such thoughts about my body? Not even just one? This one. This is my favorite one. Do you remember what we were doing here? We were posing like we were getting sucked into Mt. Fuji. This. This was a Mt. Fuji poster, right? Why'd we take a picture like this? You really don't remember? Uhh. On this day You suddenly called out my name in the middle of the night. When I went to your room, you were completely drunk. "Let's die together." You kept saying we should die together. So, holding each other like this So I said, "let's get sucked into Mt. Fuji." And you became so giddy. You said, "that's brilliant". Then Finally, we took a picture just like this. You can see the ocean. Ah, yeah you can. Right here. - That's it? - Yeah. Okay. Here we are. Alright. Okay. Ohh! Oh! Oh. Ahh! You bought it? I'm getting it for ￥5m over two years. Can't even imagine only paying that much in Tokyo. Yeah, but they say the winters are cold and summers are hot. That's it? I'm sure there's a heater and AC. Well, yeah, but... - Whoa. - Right over here. Wow. You're living here together? Not yet. Still at Tsuchizaki's place officially. We're going to live together after the wedding. Big fan of that. They made a TV show on NHK awhile back. The guy from 'Moku' was in it. Kitano wept the other day while watching it. I was surprised by that. As for me I don't really know anything about the Russo-Japanese War. Whoa! This space is really cool. What will you use this for? Ah, the kids' room. Hmm. - ...but the culprit of a 24 year old case... well, if we add it up... I wonder if I'll be watching the Tokyo Olympics with Kitano on this TV. I can't imagine that at all. TV: -in order for you to do the things you want to do... Don't sit over there. Come join me. I'm going home. Aren't you scared, Ken? Of what? For us to be like this after all that time. You're not scared? No, I'm not. Neither am I. Not at all. Not scared, huh. I'm going. Just tonight. Let's just go back to that time. So wet, right? Stop that. Fuck me. Let's go to the bed. Is that okay? Ah, sorry! Just a second. Put it in. I'm gonna come. This. Now this bed is officially broken in. You haven't done it on this bed yet with soldier-boy? Why did you want to first use it with me? This situation gets you excited. Why don't you say something? Why did you decide to get married? I want to become a mother. You want kids, huh? When I saw how many people died in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that's how I felt. What do you mean? If an only-daughter like me left no kids my dead mother would have lived for nothing. I also want my dad to see his grand kid’s face. Hmm... It sounds like bullshit. Sounds contrived, and not like you. Two years ago, when I found out I had a uterine fibroid I've been going to follow-up examinations, but last year it suddenly started getting bigger. If I want kids, the sooner the better. That's what the doctor said. Did you tell that to your fiance? Of course not. Let's do it. Come to think of it When we did it at your family's place that one time was really crazy, huh. During the Obon holiday. Your dad got drunk and passed out. We went to your room... You shoved my panties in my mouth. If you were too loud your dad would've woken up, right? I really felt good that time. Oh yeah. You get excited when there's a risk of people hearing, so we fucked in the department store bathroom. Yeah? It's me. Ken. What's up? You forget something? What's up? Did something happen? Stop it. Stop it! Ow. Stop. No. I don't like it. No. I don't like it. Ken. The tissue box by the TV. Can you bring it to me? The liver and chives from that place is on another level from those other places. How so? The liver they use is really fresh. I hadn't heard of this place until today. Well of course not. You haven't lived in this town for 15 years. I feel like I'm being called a traitor. Actually, you are a traitor. Don't do what you did earlier, okay. Yesterday I said, "only tonight", didn't I? If that were the case, don't feed me liver an chives. Come on, it's your favorite, isn't it? I'll be married in ten days, you know. You're the one who started it. Yeah, but I told you it was only for last night. The way you said it didn't sound like that. *speaking Akita dialect Yeah but I said "only tonight". I went back to that time but I lost my way coming back. What's with you suddenly speaking in dialect? I'm not trying to ruin your wedding ceremony. I came back here to attend the wedding. That's why you can't do what you did earlier. That was the last time for you and me. It doesn't work like that. Why's that? Well, fine. It's still hard. To ask someone to extinguish the flame after you yourself selfishly lit the flame. Of course I can't accept that. Please stop speaking Akita dialect. It's really unappealing. Hey. Cut it out! He'll be back from his work trip soon. When does he come back? - Next week, Wednesday. - What's today? Friday. We have five days. In five days I'll set your free. I'm not kidding. Yeah. We need to put the fish in the fridge. It's fine, there's an ice pack in the bag. No, we can't. We have to at least change the sheets. They'll just get dirty again, won't they? It feels seriously amazing. What does? Sex. I'd completely forgotten. What do you usually do? I just have sex with myself. Ken I could totally smell it yesterday when we met. Smell?! Yeah. I thought, "this person hasn't been getting laid at all". What does that smell like? Kinda like [religious] incense, I guess. Really? Like a dead person, huh? Although the smell itself is totally different from incense. What about you? One after the other? I guess it's been like that for two years since coming here. Since you got rid of me. I was desperate. I didn't get rid of you. Yes, you did. How is it with soldier-boy? Yeah, we have sex. He's been trained methodically, so his chest is like a steel plate. He pins me down and I can't move my arms or legs. Well that's good. No, it's really not. If he's a steel plate you're like a snake. When we're doing it that snake becomes a whip. Your body is just irresistible in that way. But I always felt that way. To be with you again after all that time it still feels so intense. I've never been told anything like that before. It's my own body, so I know it better than anyone. The way you know your own body and the way I know your body is not the same. Huh?! What's this? Uh, it hurts. Ow. Naoko. Naoko! Something happened. Is he back? No! This. Eh... It's really swollen. This kinda thing happened before. Is that right? Don't rub it so much! You're not used to doing it. Ah, I just remembered. Yours got like this back then. - Really? - Yeah. Will you look at it? Huh? Okay. It looks a little swollen. It's kinda puffed up. Maybe we did it too much. What did we do that time? I think we cooled it with a wet towel. - Let's do that. - Okay. Here. Here goes. Oh! It's cold, but it feels good. It's getting big again. Shall we fuck? Ah, hot. It's hot, it's hot. There we go. Guess you still are a really good cook. I like to cook for other people. Yeah, I know. It's been a while. I haven't cooked like this or had someone to eat my food in a while. It's good. Just one glass, please. It'll swell up again. Here. Just like grade school, huh? What is? 'Pon Juice' at dinner time. Right. Yeah, but now we can drink alcohol. Okay. Cheers. You become a mom, then what? 'Then what'? Why do you want to become a mother? Well Because I'm a woman. Don't you think it's unreasonable to get married just because you want kids? How come? What about the guy who is roped into a marriage for that reason? What are you talking about? Aren't there men who get married because they want kids? Come to think of it After marriage, if they can't have kids, men lose affection Ah, there are some guys like that, but... Men get married because they want to be with that woman. That's the same for women! So you're marrying soldier-boy because you want to be with him forever? Yeah, of course. So why are you spending time with me like this while he's away? That's really not your business, is it?! Firstly, you say 'just yesterday', but you're the one following me around. Look who's talking! A woman shouldn't do this kind of thing before her wedding. The reasons don't have to do with you. What are you talking about? That's why, honestly, I thought what you said yesterday was bullshit. That's why I thought I'd ask again. You act so shameless all of a sudden. it doesn't suit you. Stop talking with that weird Akita dialect. To sum it up you learned you have a uterine fibroid, panicked, and found a partner, right? As for me getting married just to see kids I don't like it. You're one to talk, since you have a kid. How old now? Maybe six years old? Do you see the kid? Not since the kid was one year old. I lost visitation rights. Ken. I'm really sorry, but It's only until Tuesday. You gotta promise that. Cried deeply After being saved Repeating mistakes Let's live together Sleep really well But wake up again Reborn again and again Let's play together Only you Are so special More cherished than a friend Let's go. Beautiful person Until then Let's chase these dreams Only you So special More precious than a lover After a deep sleep Keep your voice down. Wake in the morning Born one more time Let's play in this world Let's play in this world Let's play in this world You feeling better? Yeah. Can you make it? Yeah. All right! Sukiyaki... steak... How about beef stew? It'll take too long. This hamburger is so good. This is my third one. Oh my. It's an earthquake. Hold on. Don't we need to take cover? No. Aren't you scared? Oh, this one is not so big. Even more than just before It was really shaking during the quake in Kurikoma when I was a senior in high school. That was a level 4 quake. What about the 2011 disaster? It was level 5- And what did you think? I thought, "it's bigger than the Kurikoma quake" ...even though their both North Japan No real damage in Akita. There's a kind of like a feeling of indebtedness that I feel. A kind of guilt feeling. My friends from high school friends from Amai City, Sendai, and Ishinomaki When I called Things like, "my husband just barely made it" and, "I made it to the second floor so I was okay." And I thought I'm really grateful just being alive. I felt like seeing my old friends like my ex-boyfriend to have a drink together to celebrate together that we're alive. With your ex? That's you! Ah, right. You Tohoku is unfortunate. It's always been so. What do you mean, 'always'? In Heian era, called enishi and subjugated by the government Then in the Meiji restoration era Aizu was labelled an enemy of the state and the Ou and Etsu clans built a unified northern alliance but still lost. Then the continued discrimination and scorn of those born north of Shirakawa River. The suppressed and behind Tohoku region. To have a tsunami there?! Tohoku is just unfortunate. Sounds like it's not your problem. That's because it's not my problem. Isn't that terrible? I can pretend to see from the perspective of a victim but that doesn't mean I am one. Very honest. And so your soldier-boy came to the rescue with the defense force. Indebtedness? Maybe so. Maybe you're right. The defense forces are not in the disaster area anymore Because of the 'right of collective self- defense', they're focused war-readiness. I'm getting out Did you get a head rush from the bath? If it's diarrhea you should go as soon as possible. I'm not feeling sick though. There were some red parts in the burger, weren't there? Huh? Maybe it was that. What? It was 100% beef, so I don't think it was that. Come to think of it since you were little you've had a weak stomach, huh. Plus you didn't sleep much the last couple days. You must be tired, too. Why are you glaring at me? It was because of the burgers you made. Definitely. You're the one who said you wanted to eat meat! You said it was perfect and ate it up. You just ate too much. Good morning. How's your stomach? It seems okay. That's good, then. Thanks. Hey, Ken. If something like last night happens again what should I do? Huh? While I'm living with Kitano if I get like I did last night, what should I do? Can't you just let him be your nurse? I don't like that. Why? It's embarrassing. You say you're embarrassed but you lick each other's assholes, don't you? What's to be embarrassed about? The thing for me is being naked in front of you doesn't bother me. No matter what you do to me, no matter what we do together... I'm fine. But, you know I feel uncomfortable with other people. I start to feel pathetic and gross. I think it's because I'm related to you that it feels good. I feel like that's definitely part of it. Blood is pretty thick between cousins, don't you think? That's why I even if I have sex with other people I haven't once experienced the same level of burning passion I feel with you. There's probably lots of siblings in this world who have sex together. I think there's a lot of parents and kids doing it, too. And when it gets like that when it feels so good like with us even when you try to, it's really hard to stop. Since we're related by blood it's an unbreakable bond. That's why until he gets back we can do whatever we want. It's fine. As long as, before he gets back we put a stop to it it's fine. First time on a bus, huh? Yeah. It's full of people going to the Bon dance festival. If you keep quiet we won't get caught. I don't think I can do that. Name is Nogara. My skirt's going to get wet. Take off your panties. Lift your butt. You can come. It's kind of erotic, huh. Maybe because you can't see the face? Yeah, maybe. You can't tell if it's a man or a woman either. It's like they're dancing on the border of this world and the spirit world. They call it no-ja dance. Does no-ja mean dead person? People who are dead, but can't enter heaven. It's like us, huh? Why's that? Because, we one time, committed double suicide in the crater of Mt. Fuji. Tonight's the last night, huh? Can you keep your promise? Let's run away together. Are you serious? Ken, why did you get divorced? Eh?! I've always wondered about it. Why? My affair was exposed. Always saying I had to work overtime and staying out all night. It's no surprise with such reckless behavior she found out. Since we have kids we thought maybe we shouldn't get divorced. But her dad was really pissed off. I was forced to sign the divorce papers. What happened between you and the other girl? I thought since I'd divorced we would be together. She said she wasn't interested in that. Hmm. In the apartment without my wife and daughter, I couldn't sleep, I just drank. Pretty soon I was walking circles around my room with the lamp cord around my neck. When I finally caught a glimpse of my reflection in the window I was really shocked. I went to emergency outpatient care. Then I went to a med-psych detective and I quit my job. Ken, what do you want to do now? What do I want to do? You're just a vagabond now. I guess I'll find some proper work. I have to work, right? - One more. - Okay. Yeah, but, Ken You say 'find proper work', but you won't find that. Huh... Do you have savings? It's debt I have. I don't have much but I can lend you money. I'm not so desperate as to take money from a part-timer like you. You know something, The thing with you is you're a weakling, and though you act reckless in contrast, you're strangely prideful. Think about what you'd be best at. When things don't go well, you get caught up in thinking it's just a lack of effort. But, you know The thing with people is when it's not working it doesn't matter how much effort you put in, it won't work. That's when you need to depend on other people. At least that's what I think. You always have Nobuko and Uncle. Why not sell the family house? No one's using it anyway. Nobuko if it's for you she'll tell you to use it as you like. That new house you got is ￥5m, right? There's no one who will buy the family house for even half that. Hey. When did you first notice I was dating my ex-wife? From the day the first day she and you had sex. You called out to me in the middle of the night. You said let's die together, didn't you? That's the day, right? Yeah. That day we went to a hotel for the first time. In the taxi on the way I said "let's get married." When I got back to my tattered little company apartment as soon as I was alone I really wanted to die. I wanted to die. I'm sorry. You were really scary that time. Scary? So casually lying and having sex with me. I thought, "men really are selfish." Really... But having my body touched by you right after you touched another woman. I could truly feel it. It was the worst feeling. That's why I thought of escaping. If not I felt like I'd be losing to my own body. That's when you suddenly asked me to come home. That's right. Even though I had already lined up work at the nursery in Suginami [in Tokyo]. I felt like I needed to get away from your body. But, you know there were times when I thought I should just wait a little longer. I knew it wouldn't work out between you and that woman. Don't take this the wrong way. You should have actually more properly listened to your body. Listened to what my body needed... You know, Aunt Ikuno Actually, said "I've always thought you two should be together" She said that one time When? Right after getting back from your wedding. My mom said that? That time, I thought maybe I should just tell the truth. Marriage between relatives is pretty hard, right? I'd always thought you and I would have to break it off ever since the first time we did it since it's "incest". A part of me felt embarrassed for enjoying sex so much with my cousin. So, I did it with a guilty conscience in places like dept. store bathrooms and alleyways Is that how it was? As for you Hm? I did it because I thought you liked doing it in those places. But you really liked it, right? You made such incredible sounds. The way you came was amazing. It's because I really loved you. She thought we should be together? Why couldn't mom have said that sooner?! Seriously. She asked me why I'd divorced, but she never asked why I got married. Because she was pregnant. What's the matter? I want to come inside you. Huh? It's not okay, is it. Sorry. Dear Kenji Nagahara, Ken, These five days, were so fun. It was like a dream. Thank you so much. I'll be waiting at the wedding ceremony. Please come, okay. -Naoko PS I'll pay for the hotel room. Yeah. Were you sleeping? What is it? Come on, what's up? I just got a call from Tetsuo Satou. Uh-huh. He said the wedding has been postponed. Wedding? Naoko's wedding? Yeah. What, why?! Do you know why? Her fiance, who's in the armed forces, got some sudden assignment. What? What's that about? They've had this ceremony planned for months. What, did a war start? If you can believe it they both were at your aunt's place yesterday and apparently they said they've got to postpone the wedding. A postponement? So when will it be? You haven't heard anything from Naoko? Stopping it right before the wedding, it's weird. I don't know anything. They told your aunt postponed, but it seems like it's really a cancellation. I don't think Testuo will be okay with this. I'll ask Naoko about it. If you find out anything, let me know. Okay. Ken? I'm sorry. Were we found out? It's not that. Huh? When he got back from the regional office he said we can't have the wedding because of an urgent mission. An urgent mission. What is that? Urgent mission? What is that? He won't tell me. He said it's a confidential mission. Confidential? No matter what, he can't talk about it. Heh? Hey, Ken. Hm? Will you come to my place now? What? He's not there? What's this? Since you came out here today I thought I'd give this back to you. I'd been looking for this at home forever. I couldn't find it that time, but when I went to my dad's place last night, I finally found it. Huh? Ahh! Why do you have this? You sent it to me! When you moved away to get married. You told me to keep it. I had this in a frame decorating my room forever. It was always precious to me. Forever? Until I decided to get married. On the night of the engagement party, I took it off the wall. Since I was going to get married I thought it was my turn to give it back but it doesn't look like I can do that. It's going to erupt. Erupt? They're going to make an announcement the day after tomorrow. After 300 years it's gonna blow. This World Heritage Site. It's gonna erupt, huh? This. Yesterday. When we got back from my dad's, Kitano was exhausted and went right to sleep. Canceled the wedding last minute and wouldn't even tell me what his mission is. I couldn't fall asleep. I opened up his computer and opened up all his files. The password was just as I expected. "sakanouenokumo" *cloud over the hill I found the description of the mission. You could get arrested for stealing state secrets. In the morning I confronted him about it. Then He got really angry but I didn't back down. As the commander of disaster relief operation corps he will be in charge of disaster relief emergency exit strategy repair work, and public order. He told me, "If you try this kind of wannabe spy shit again I'm seriously calling off the marriage." He was really mad. Yeah, I'll bet. But then I found out Mt. Fuji will erupt and I thought, honestly, maybe he's not the right guy. It was I who gave up on everything first. So it's fine for you to be here, Ken. Books about Mt. Fuji's volcanic activity From tomorrow all of Japan will be in commotion. Yeah, it will. Even though it's so quiet and peaceful now. Well, you know the volcanic ash won't reach this far. You came back at a good time, huh ken. Yeah, but But you're situation is messed up. I don't care. Getting married just to have kids is disingenuous. That's what you said, right? I did. I was kinda thinking the same thing. But if I didn't do that I thought there wouldn't be anything else for me to do. I just kinda thought there's really nothing else to do but have kids. But the moment I heard My. Fuji was going to erupt... It felt like an awakening. How come? Because, it's Mt. Fuji. After looking every single day at that poster magma is going to come gushing out of that huge crater. This time it's not going to come out of that part. Here on the side of the mountain it seems that a new crater will open up. Yeah, but it's definitely going to erupt, right? Uh-huh. It seems Tokyo will have 10 cm of ash. Travel times will be affected like when it snows. The urban power and functionality of Tokyo will falter. Isn't that a really serious problem? Yeah, it's really serious. Now no matter what happens nothing is unexpected. This country A war-like era will come. Then what will you do? Even when it gets to that point You don't plan to do anything? What do you mean, 'plan'? Well after seeing it all those years you won't be able to see Mt. Fuji anymore. And even so, you haven't decided anything? You need to stop all that 'just thinking' and take control of your own life, don't you think that? If the nuclear power plant in Shizuoka gets messed up by volcanic ash and it's worse than the Fukushima situation... making some kind of life plan at this point won't make a difference. We can live how we like now. That's why I can live with you as long as I want Have sex as much as we want. That's what I want to do most. Is that so? That's what my body wants. Your voice is loud. Why'd you stop? We were seen. Really? Your voice is too loud. It's that loud? When you're coming you don't know how loud your own voice is. I think it was young kids. Young kids? On their way back from cram school, right? Did you really get a good look? They had a cell phone light on but I don't think they could really see what we were doing. Shall we eat some ramen and go home? Let's keep doing it before eating. Go home early... This is going to be like a war-torn country from tomorrow. Any moment now. I guess so. Any moment now. Let's go. Mt. Fuji hasn't erupted yet, but as you can see, evacuees are filling the roadway. Due to traffic controls, roads from Shizuoka are backed up more than 100 km. This morning, a Mt. Fuji eruption warning was issued The volcanic alert level had been raised from level two, needing the national guard to level four which requires evacuation, but just now level four was raised to level five. According to the Fuji hazard map committee the danger area Is between 3700 and 14600 kilometers. 1800 km of train lines have been suspended Six airports will close with even 0.1 mm of ash. Those who cannot evacuate must live in an environment polluted with ash. Going outside is also dangerous. If the volcanic glass in the ash gets in the eyes, it will cause severe pain. If you inhale it, it will injure your lungs and other organs and cause irritation and inflammation. So, if you are on your way to the evacuation area... Ken. Good morning. Naoko. Mt. Fuji. Still? Still. It hasn't happened yet. Well then. Naoko. What's up? Can I come inside? Why are you laughing? Okay. Ken, does that feel good? Yeah. What about you? It feels so good.
