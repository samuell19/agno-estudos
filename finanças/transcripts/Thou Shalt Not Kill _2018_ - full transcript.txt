Doctor... Could you step aside for a moment? Doctor, please. Sit down. - Sit down. - Here we go. In accordance with law no. 95 of 2006 on health care reform as amended and subsequent amendments, with the order of the MSP No 921 of 2006 on the organisation of public hospitals and with Articles 247-252 of the republished Labour Code... Following the complaint of the head nurse Rodica Popa of the Paediatric Surgery Department and after hearing the parties involved and witnesses, the Disciplinary Commission met today, 11 November, orders: sanction Dr Cristian Badea with a written warning, in accordance with Article 46(a) of the internal regulations. With right of appeal before the competent courts within 30 days. - Do you have anything to add? - No. Cristian, wait a minute. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - Having trouble at home? - No. - Are you sure? - Sure, Professor. Well, so what? Is it nice what you did? Did you even apologize? - No, I haven't. - And you're not going to? You're a doctor. How do you hit a nurse? I didn't hit her, I told you. I pushed her. And that's not serious? I've explained ten times that I couldn't give her a positive report. Cristian, what's wrong with you? You were my student. If you'd done that at school... We're not at school anymore. What did you say? Nothing. Hey, boy, do you know who Pythagoras was? - Yeah, I do. - No, you don't. Pythagoras had three kinds of disciples: those who listened, those who could ask questions and those who were Pythagoras' equals. You are at the beginning. You only have the right to listen. Have you been listening? Yes, Professor. Then go and apologize. Cristian, do you want coffee? No, thanks. You're an asshole. What did they give you? A warning. It could be worse. Did you apologize? Hey, did you talk to the teacher? No, I didn't. But wouldn't it be nice to apologize to Rodica? What for? I'm right. That shit's no good. What's one got to do with the other? It does! That cow threw my report and told me to make it positive. We all did positive. Why don't you? Because the products are no good! Aren't we all complaining about them? Okay, so what are you proposing? Should we all go and beat the head nurse? What do you say, Ioana? Are you in? Come on, I'm not in the mood for jokes. Georgica, what do you think? Nothing. I'm sleeping. See? There's no one to make a revolution with. We'll draw up a paper, we'll all sign it. and take it to Brătescu and if... Dr. Badea, the room is clear. Yes, thanks. I was joking, you're taking it seriously. Well, it's serious. I'm sorry. I'm not a Che Guevara type. Mrs. Nadica. Are the results ready? What time should I come? All right, I'll call you when I'm free. I'll do it. Okay, Nadica. Thanks, Nadica. 'kay, kisses. Bye. Good evening. - Feeling better? - Yeah. These are in 350 hospitals and they're disinfecting 2,000 operating rooms... Aren't you supposed to pick me up from work? I forgot, I'm sorry. - Of course, if all you can think of is that crap! - It's not crap. I wash with it before I operate. I know! Every day you're bugging with this. Well, if they're no good... - Should I tell you again tell that I don't care? - How can you not care, Sofia? You work there too! Don't you get it that I'm fed up of getting into trouble because of you? Keep your voice down! The whole block can hear you. Smoke outside the window. Didn't I tell you to take boneless? - They didn't have boneless. - They didn't? You were too lazy to look. Next time you buy it yourself. I'll buy, I see you can't handle it. Okay, I'm off. You know the head nurse doesn't answer my hello anymore? You don't say hello to her either. - Cristian, stop it, please! - Stop what? - Stop making trouble at work. - What do you want me to do? Shut up? - They gave you a warning. - So what? So you want them to kick you out? Someone has to tell them it's not okay. But why you? Let the others. - What others? - Others. Nobody says anything. All I did was tell them... - It's not your job to tell them. - Yes, it is mine. No it's not, you're a doctor. Your job is to operate. - Sofia, I have to do something. - You don't have to do anything. I can't just hide it ostrich-style. For all I care do it doggy-style. Doggy? Come on, not now. What is it, Ilie? What's his blood pressure? Is he having seizures? Does he have diarrhea? What's wrong? Is his face swollen? Well, what did you give him? Cristian, the keys! Want a coffee? No. I told the stretcher bearers. Okay. And the parents? You want me to tell them? - Yeah, can you? - Okay. Give me the number. Cărbunaru Nicolae. Yes. 0725... 0725... Let me call. Are you sure? Yes. - Good morning. - Morning. Good morning. Let's get started, I'm in a hurry. Come on. Come on, hurry up. I haven't got all day for you. Who was on duty? I was, Professor. I had two patients... Ilie, I'll hear the report at the end. First, I'll divide the rooms. Where's the head nurse? She asks you to excuse her. She was called for an emergency. - And you're taking notes? - Yes, Professor. Don't you have an agenda? Yes, in my phone. Stop looking at me like that my penile nitric oxide is rising. - What, are you mad? - No, Professor. All right, let's get started. Anybody got an emergency? I have pyloric stenosis. Ionuț Gâdeș... Okay, I'll give you room 2. Ioana, you'll stay for tomorrow. Please. I postponed again. You can't... First thing tomorrow. Ilie, what's on your list? Magda Simion, 12 years old, cervical adenopathy. Room 1, first thing. Marius? Andrei Vasile, 3 years old, inguinal hernia. It's easy. Room 2, after Ioana. Tudor? It's not easy. He could die. A hernia patient died. Is he the first? Yes, it's the first. - It happens. Tudor? - It wasn't supposed to happen. What did you do wrong? He went into septic shock. You left something inside? These are the tests that I took before the surgery. CBC, creatinine, urea, blood sugar and coagulation samples. - And? - All normal. And this is the bacteriological exam from last night. I told you I'd hurry. Klebsiella, Piocyanic, Staphylococcus aureus. These are all bacteria he picked up at the hospital. Well, if you don't wash your hands properly. But I talk, I hear. Procedure must be followed: Wet, soap, wash, rinse. Start with the clean areas... It's not how we wash, but what we wash with. - Hey, boy, you starting again? - That biocide's no good. Only you have that problem. See anybody else complaining? Yeah, everybody complains. Speak up, guys. Ilie, am I right? - Cristian, calm down. - Yes, I'm very calm. George, didn't you say it's just water? Speak up! Ioana, didn't you say there's no alcohol in it? Tudor, at least you say something. Marius? Speak up. What, am I crazy? Say something! You did your number. Can we go on? Take a couple of days off to get yourself together. - I don't need it. - Yes, you do. You're in shock. Yeah, I'm shocked you didn't back me up. And what would you have me do? Anger the professor? Ah, head nurse... Everyone keeps telling me I should apologize. - Cristian, please... - Leave me alone, I want to talk to the lady. - May I call you Rodica? - No. Rodica, I want to tell you that you suck dick. - Stop it! - But wash it well with biocide first. But not that one from the hospital. You'll get Piocean in your throat and die. Asshole. I'll report you to the committee. Doctor. Wait a minute, Doctor. Nicolae! You killed my baby, fuck you, you motherfucker! - No! Leave him alone! - I gave you 200 euros and you killed him. Fuck you and your whole fucking family! Didn't you say it was an easy operation? Didn't you say? Didn't you say he'd be fine? - Didn't you say? - Stop, you're killing him! Bring my baby back, you fucking motherfucker! - Get off him! - Bring my baby back! - You killed my baby, you motherfucker. - That's it. Please. Fuck you and you whole family, motherfucker! Get out of here! You want him to kill you? Get out of here! - You killed my baby. - Stop, please. You killed my baby, you fucking dead fuck! Stop, stop. Please, stop. Fuck you, motherfucker! Stop! No! No more, please. I'm in a hurry. - What happened to you? - I'm fine. - These are the results? - Yes. I checked them three times. I thought I was wrong. - That's what glutaraldehyde is? - Yes. And chlorhexidine? Yes. I told you I triple-checked them. - I'm leaving, I'm freezing to death. - Wait a minute. No need. Bye. I'll talk to you later. Thanks a lot, Nadica. Where's Șerbănescu? I don't know. Check his office. How could you talk to Rodica like that? The whole hospital knows. I'm talking to you. And where have you been? Why are you dirty on your hoodie? Cristian. I was right. Biocide is no good. All the active substances are diluted. Glutaraldehyde is 1% instead of 12. Chlorhexidine is... - What are these? - Concentration tests. Who ordered them? The hospital? No. I went to a lab where I have a friend... Let me get this straight. You took biocide from the hospital and tested it? - Yes. - That's stealing. - Professor, my patient... - What am I supposed to do with you? You tell me. Shall I call the disciplinary committee again? Should I report you to the police? - My patient... - We're talking about you now, not the patient! You're out of line. You beat up nurses, swear them, steal from the hospital. Look at the state of you. What are you getting at? I don't want any more of my patients to die. Then pray to God or learn to operate. - You think I did the wrong surgery? - A first-year resident could've done it. - Report me to board of medicine. - Don't worry, I won't. - You're obligated to turn me over to the Board. -Cristian... You don't get one thing. We are doctors. We don't rat on each other. My patient died because of bacteria in the hospital. Get out. Bacteria that the biocide was supposed to destroy. You need to order tests for all the biocides in the hospital. You don't tell me what to do! Do you understand? I taught you how to hold a scalpel in your hand, not you in mine! Impertinent boy! You need to talk to the manager. Have the ward closed down and disinfected. - And maybe the whole hospital. - You're sick. - Do you know where the manager is? - He's at CNAS. Mr. Bratescu, I'm Dr. Cristian Badea from... Yes, I know who you are. The professor told me you're causing trouble. If you don't stop, I'll throw you out, understand? I'll see who else hires you! - Hello. - Hi, there. - Who's with us? - A doctor. Doctor who? That friend of yours. The one with the crooked eye. What's this? An American procedure? Sofia asked me to come and talk to you. She did? Well, let her start. Say, honey, what's bothering you? - Cristian, take it easy... - Take what easy? - You know what I mean. - I don't know what you mean. I've brought you some more croissants, and help yourselves, please. - Never mind, don't bother. - Don't you like them? Yes, but I've had enough. Two or three more won't hurt. Please. I made them. - Thank you, thank you. - Sofia, have some. Can you give us a minute? Yeah, well, I'll leave them here. Who knows? Maybe you get hungry and have some more. - Is this a joke to you? - Yeah, it's a joke. Didn't I have a hernia patient die? But it's a bad joke and nobody's laughing. - Cristian, I understand what you're going through... - You understand a dick. I really do. I have patients dying too. But it's not your fault. - That kid didn't die because of you either. - Really? Go tell that to the professor. Or the parents. It's the hospital's fault. And why didn't you say that in the meeting? - Tell who? - Tell who? The Professor! You think he doesn't know? - He know about biocides? - Yes. He knows that because of them there's infection in the hospital? Yes. He knows, the manager knows too. Everybody on the board knows. - And why aren't they doing anything? - Why? They were all on the committee when the biocides auction took place. You mean they took their cut? - I don't know. That's what I heard. - From who? From who? Come on, Cristian. Go on. I want to know who told you. Does it matter? I want to know who he heard it from. Tell me, Ilie! From some who heard from others and then told me. - Yeah, but from whom? - Come on, stop it. Tell me, I want to know. I didn't know. Of course you didn't know. Everyone is avoiding you. They've seen how bad you react... And you knew? Cristi, where are you going? What did you tell him, dear? - I didn't say anything. - How come? Can't you see he's upset? Come on, leave me alone. Don't tell me to leave you alone! You live in my house... Cristi! Darling, come back. Don't worry, it's all there. - Thanks. - Thank you. Bye. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Well, didn't I say they should be sealed? - They're fine. I just started them. I can't do anything with them. They have to be sealed. Okay. I'll be right back. - Morning. - Morning. Did you bring them? Yes. That many? Yes. From five hospitals. Hands, surfaces and instruments. - I don't know if I can help you. - I'll pay for it. It's gonna be expensive. It doesn't matter. Do the math and I'll find a way. Okay. I'll e-mail you. - No, text me. - Okay. - Are they sealed? - Yeah. And it says on each one what hospital it's from. Okay. I'll talk to the chief, maybe I can get you a discount. Thanks, Nadica. Here, let me help you. How are you otherwise? I'm fine. - Sofia? - She's fine. Maybe you can come over one night and play a game of canasta. I'll tell her. - Morning. - Morning. Excuse me. - What was his name again? - Cărbunaru Ovidiu. It's like this every day. I stay for half an hour and nothing comes out. Could it be prostate? I don't know. Didn't you have a checkup? Why? I'm fine. - When did you say he died? - Yesterday. I don't have him here. How can you not have him? I don't. No autopsy. It was a suspicious death. It was mandatory. Let's see. We found him. Ovidiu Cărbunaru. Death certificate issued. Who signed it? Chief of the department, Dr. Augustin Șerbănescu, and the doctor on duty, Ilie Toma. - Is the child still in the morgue? - No. The relatives took him. Cristi, is that you? Cristi? Sofia's been calling you all night. Why didn't you answer? That girl's right too. You can't just take off like that, whenever you feel like it. I didn't sleep all night. Well, you don't think about us. Did you have a fight at the hospital? - No. - Come on! Sofia told me. Let me iron your shirt. How many times should I tell you? Stop arguing with them. You're giving them a chance to badmouth you. You have to look after your own interests. That's what you have to do. You have to become a big doctor. Because of this I've been struggling with your father to keep you in school for so long... What are you doing? Give me your shirt so I can iron it, I said. Leave it, it's fine. How can you dress like a hobo? Come on, Cristi. Let me. - What's wrong with your hand? - Nothing, I hurt myself. Did you put some ointment on it? Yes, don't worry. It's just a scratch. Can I have some money? There's some in the kitchen, on the cupboard, a million. It's not enough. How much do you need? There's some money in your drawer. - That's my funeral money. - Come on, Mom, you're not dying tomorrow. What if something happens? What do I do? How much do I pay the handyman? What handyman? Didn't I order my cross? Marble cross, white, beautiful. An angel with wings spread. You'll like it. Say, Mom, can I have that money? Why do you need it? Are you in trouble? - I don't have a problem. - Then why do you need so much money? - Are you giving it to me or not? - Don't you hear that I don't touch that? What, you want me to die and end up the laughingstock of the world like the one on three? They buried her in a pine coffin. She didn't even had a repast. Everyone in the building talked about her. Me when I die, I'll only take a cherry coffin. It's better, stronger, it doesn't rot so fast. - You understand? - Yes, Mother. - And now you're going to the hospital, right? - Yes. - Shall I make you some sandwiches? - No. For the road. I'm not hungry. - Maybe you will. - I won't. Thank you. Watch your driving. Nicolae. The doctor's here. Come in. Nicolae. Get him something to eat. Come on, Maia. Come in, Doctor. Have a seat. Thank you. - You should say: "May God forgive him." - May God forgive him! Did I hit you hard? No. He was angry. He didn't mean to. Please forgive me. I heard you picked him up from the hospital. Yes. I found a place for him at Andronache. Do you know the cemetery? No. It's here, nearby, a few blocks. It's good that it's close. Yeah. Good. We'll take the bus 21 one stop and we're there. We can walk too. It's not far. But in winter is harder. Because they never clear the snow here. In winter we take the 21. If it snows a lot. Because if not... We walk. Yeah. Why are you here, Doctor? To ask your permission for the autopsy. Why do an autopsy? To find out why he died. Didn't he die from the operation? No. He got an infection from the bacteria in the hospital. From the bacteria? Yes. Klebsiella, Piocyanic, Staphylococcus aureus... They're very powerful microbes And they use biocides to destroy them. Some disinfectants that they use in hospitals, on the floors, on the operating tables, the instruments, the patients... Doctors wash their hands with them. Only the biocide... That disinfectant was no good. It was diluted ten times. And because of that... But you don't have to believe me. Sue me. We thought of that. I talked to a cousin, he's a lawyer. Marius Cărbunaru. Do you know him? No. He said a trial takes time. That they'll take you around through the courts for years... It's expensive too. You have to pay for experts. I'll pay for it. Never mind, Doctor, it's not all about money. We have a little girl to raise. We don't have time to waste in court. But someone has to be punished. It's either my fault or the hospital's. What's the point? Nobody's bringing my baby back. But you can't leave it like this. You have to ask for an autopsy. Doctor. God didn't want him to live any longer. That's it. Not eating? This is the money you gave me. Would you like to see him? Yes. They said I'm not allowed to keep him in the house. Let me hear someone say something, I'd beat him to death... You're going to the hospital tomorrow, right? You know the professor likes you. Cristian, why don't you talk to me? Leave me alone. No. Sorry... I told the secretary. He knows. It'll only take five minutes. - When it clears, I'll let you know. - Please. I've been here for four hours. I understand, but there are others before you. Any idea how much longer? No. Would you like a coffee? No, thank you. Bye. Bye, Lori. - Mr. Abagiu? - Yes. I'm Dr. Cristian Badea from hospital 147... - Ah, with the audience. - Yes. I'm sorry. I have to get to the government urgently. Come tomorrow and we'll talk. - It'll only take five minutes. - I believe you, but I don't have the five minutes. This is a serious public health issue. Tell me briefly. Septopharma is the biggest biocide manufacturer in the country. Their products go into 350 hospitals and 2,000 operating rooms. What's the problem? The biocides are diluted 10 times and no longer kill bacteria. On the contrary! The bacteria adapt and become immune to antibiotics. You're being admitted for appendicitis and you die of sepsis. - Do you have any proof? - Yeah, I do. Right here. Get in. Tell me about it on the way. These are the concentration tests for two biocides. All the active ingredients are diluted. Glutaraldehyde is 1% instead of 12. Chlorhexidine is 0.2% instead of 8. Maybe it's just one batch. No. I think all the biocides from Septopharma are diluted. Should be nosocomial infections. And they're not. Yes, they are. And the proof is in the fact that the use of antibiotic in hospitals increased. Look. Cluj, Arad, Timisoara, Constanta, Iasi... Where did you get this data? From the ministry's website. Statistically we have only 0.2% nosocomial. Is that right? How can we only have 0.2%? When in the West the rate is 5-10%. And what hospitals and conditions do they have compared to us? Well, what's the explanation? Infections go unreported. It can't be. We've got hospital boards in every hospital. We have DSPs, we have ISPs, we have the minister's control team. What, nobody saw anything? Maybe they were helped not to see. You need to check all Septopharma products. Have them tested for concentration and efficacy. Pull over when you can. Leave me a phone number. It's in your file. I'll talk to the minister. If what you say is true, it's very serious. Hello. What's wrong, Mom? - Why are you crying? - Leave me alone. Cristian. What have you done with the money? - Tell me what you did with the money. - I spent it. That much money? What did you spend it on? - That's none of your business. - Not my business? It was our down payment on the house. And you took it and your mother's money. I'll put it back. Where from? You haven't been to the hospital. They'll kick you out. Let them. What did you do with my papers? You care more about those papers than me. You threw them away? Yeah, I threw them away. Yeah, I threw them away. - Cristi, what are you doing? - What have you done with my papers? Keep it down, the neighbors can hear you. I don't give a shit about the hags in the block. I'm fed up. If you don't go to the hospital tomorrow... You don't understand. I can't operate in that hospital anymore. Yes, you will. Take a shower, you go to bed and you go to work tomorrow. - I'm not! - You think you can just do whatever you want? After all the sacrifices I made for you in that hospital... What sacrifices? What sacrifices did you make for me? - Tell me, Sofia. - Slow down, children, please. Hey, are you hitting me? Are you completely crazy? What's it like? Looks like the ad, right? Come on, put those down, so I can show you around. This is the bathroom. You've got a boiler... Hot water when you want it. You need to wait a little to heat up. This is the kitchen, fully equipped. Gas works, too. You got everything you need. Okay, so... We have this: The bed with the brown cover, one, two, three glass cabinets, the cupboard, coffee table with lamp. In the bathroom, a brand-new boiler, you've seen it, and a piece of shelving with spotlights. Wooden rack in the hallway. In the kitchen we have a kitchen table, stove with hood, six-speed washing machine. Oh, and the hallway light. Good. Sign here. Who was here before? I don't know, bro, I got 18 apartments. Two in Balta Alba, four in Militari. Two in the back at Lujerului, two at Gorjului. I have Dinică Golescu, I have Cosmonautilor, Ion Câmpineanu. Well, I don't have Câmpineanu anymore. I traded it for two in Pantelimon. But I have this one, Negoiu... on the Salt Road... I've got that street... what's it called? To go to the National Arena, to the stadium. I don't know. - Aren't you from Bucharest? - Yes, I am. Come on, you keep me here and I've got work to do. Come on, sign. Eight hundred. I'll be right out. Sanda! - Yeah. - Come here a minute, please. - Would you like some tea, coffee? - Why did you call me? Thank you. Here's the deal. A friend called me. He's the director of a hospital in Lyon. He needs a good surgeon. I called Professor and he told me about you. - What do you think? - I thought you wanted to fire me. But I see you're promoting me. Well, I'm doing you some good, they're doing me some good. Okay? Are we clear? Biocides are diluted. Here are the results. Sit down, please. Tell me... I'm curious. What are you insisting on with these biocides? Well, because of them. there's nosocomial infection in the hospital. All over the world there's hospital-acquired infections. Haven't you seen a week ago in Germany? Some babies died, poor things. Yeah, because a nurse didn't respect protocol. It was human error. Well, you see? That's what I'm saying. Mistakes are made all over the world. We don't make mistakes. Biocides are diluted. Good. Let's go your way. Let's say the biocides are diluted. That doesn't mean they're no good. Well, they stop killing bacteria. How can they be good? How can they not kill them? Of course they kill them. Look... I've done efficacy tests. Read. See? Most of them came out fine. Most of them? Yeah, most of them. Well, doesn't it say so? 82%. And what do I tell a patient who needs hernia surgery? Theoretically, you have a 100% chance of getting out. Well, practically only 82%, because the hospital bought diluted biocides. And what do you want? To declare a nosocomial infection and shut down the hospital? Yes. If I get more than 1% infection, I'm out. Put yourself in my place. What would you do? - I'd quit. - And have some fool come in my place? It's better than a thief. If it wasn't me, this hospital would've closed down a long time ago. I'm the one who brought in the CT scanner. - I changed... - Change the biocides. Let's say I change them. I'm changing all the biocides. What do you think happens the next day? Do you know? This phone's gonna ring. So? And I have to answer it. So? - You don't understand. - Yes, I do. No, you don't understand at all. I understand that patients are dying because of some bullshit biocide... Yes. And they're still gonna die. And because of shitty people. Man... Cristian. You know what the alternative is? Close three quarters of the hospitals. But what about cancer patients? Those who need dialysis? Have you thought about it? Where do they get treatment? At least now they have a chance. The Lyon offer still stands. You can take your wife. We'll find her some work. No, thanks. Be a smart boy. Think again. I almost forgot. The minister called me. He was curious who the hell Dr. Badea is. Wait a minute, it's not just my opinion. I did concentration tests. I can e-mail them to you. Then you go to a few hospitals and... I'm not teaching you how to make journalism, ma'am. I'm just... Iustin Brătescu. And the head of the department is Professor Augustin Șerbănescu. No, I didn't say that. Yes, he's a very good surgeon, but that's not the problem. Listen to me for a moment... Can I meet you somewhere and explain? Okay, I'll wait for your call. Yeah, that's my number. Hello? Good evening. My name is Cristian Badea. I'm a doctor. at the pediatric surgery department of hospital 147 in Bucharest. I have a subject that I think you might be interested in. It's about biocides in the hospital. Biocides. Not with a "p", with a "b". Biocides are used in hospitals against bacteria, viruses and spores. With them we disinfect operating rooms, patient wards and medical instruments. Surgeons wash their hands with them. The problem is Septopharma biocides are diluted. Glutaraldehyde is 1% instead of 12. Chlorhexidine is 0.2% instead of 8. And didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride is 0.9% instead of 7. That means the bacteria is no longer being destroyed. Instead, they're helped to adapt and become immune to antibiotics. And patients die infected with Piocyanic or Staphylococcus aureus. I spoke to the hospital, I went to the ministry, and no one's done anything. Because they all get money from Septopharma. And the auction committees, and the hospital managers, and the ward chiefs, and the head nurses, and the DSPs, and the ministry. There are nosocomial infections in many hospitals, but they are not reported. Septopharma is the largest producer of biocides in our country. Their products reach 350 hospitals and 2,000 operating rooms. Biocides are used in hospitals against bacteria, viruses and spores. They disinfect operating rooms, patient wards, medical instruments... Do you have cats? - Have what? - Cats. - No. - I have a striped one. It's not really mine. I got it for my dad, he's got a heart condition and I read that it helps with blood pressure. Is that true? I don't know. It's not a breed. I got it off the street. I didn't pay money for it. It would've been stupid of me. Take off your hoodie, please. I don't like it. It has short sleeves. Wait a minute, I'm doing just portrait. Not in full. - Ah, OK. - I'm leaving the sleeves off. - OK, then it's OK. That's fine. - Isn't it? But this light... Let's put him close the wall. - Let's have a background. - Okay. Let's stand against the wall, please. A little to the left. My left, please. A little bit more. That's good. Wait, wait a minute. - There you go. Isn't that better? - That's right. All right, we'll look in the room. And we're not smiling. What do you got? I want to file a complaint with a prosecutor. Report or complaint? What's the difference? Well, why don't you find out first? We're gonna make these people to wait. I'm sorry, you're right. Were you harmed directly or indirectly? Directly. Then it's a complaint. - At the tables you have... - No. Indirectly. Will you make up your mind? Ma'am, I'm a doctor. I had a patient die because of hospital negligence. And many more will die, if I do nothing. Do you understand? That's whistle-blowing. It can be verbal or written. Anything you want. - Verbal. - It's better written. Written, then. The form is at the table. On the walls you have the model you fill in. - And after I fill out the form... - Silvica, do you have a second? Yes, what is it? Can you help me out with those new forms? - Ask Radu to help you too. - Radu's with the boss. Okay, come on. Number F0009 at counter 12. Number Z0012 at counter 15. Go to the counter, huh? If you don't talk to the counter, who'll help you? Thank you. Why didn't the article appear? - You said it was coming out today. - Calm down. Calm down. I want to know why it didn't show up? No fuss, okay? Let me explain. - Hey, you get out of here! - Sergiu, stay out of this! - Hello, I'm talking to you! - Sergiu, I can handle it. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Tell me why he didn't show up? - Just bear with me for a moment. - Tell me why he didn't show up. - Calm down. The boss wanted the story, but marketing objected. What did you say? The boss wanted the story, but the marketing objected. Marketing? They said Pharma would pull out their ads. Well, what am I supposed to do? They're with the money. I'm sorry. It was a good article. Man, I'm really sorry. You know what I mean? Remove all metal objects and put them in the tray. A signature. Hands and feet apart. Turn around. Wait here. I'm listening. You haven't looked at the file. Go ahead. I'm Cristian Badea, a doctor at the Pediatric Surgery Department of Hospital 147 in Bucharest. And I made this denunciation because I'm dissatisfied with Septopharma products in the hospital. Septopharma is the largest manufacturer of biocides in our country. Their products reach 350 hospitals and 2000 operating rooms. That's almost everywhere in the country. Biocides are used in hospitals against bacteria, viruses and spores. They disinfect operating rooms, patient wards, medical instruments, patients are cleaned before they are operated on, surgeons wash their hands with them. The problem is Septopharma biocides are diluted. You have on file concentration test results from six hospitals in Bucharest. Glutaraldehyde is 1% instead of 12. Chlorhexidine is 0.2% instead of 8. Didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride is 0.9% instead of 7. That means the bacteria are no longer being destroyed. On the contrary, they are helped to adapt and become immune to antibiotics... And patients die infected with Piocyanic or Staphylococcus aureus. It's a public menace. I spoke to the hospital board, I went to the ministry, and no one has done anything. I think they're all getting money from Septopharma. And the tender committees, and hospital managers, and ward chiefs, and head nurses, and DSPs... Wait a minute. Let me get a colleague. Emil, can you come here a minute? I have a strange case. About? Some biocides. I don't know what biocides are. Disinfectants they use in hospitals. Well, what's the big deal... I don't know. Is that our jurisdiction? - They don't have to go to... - Come on, lady, listen to him. Good afternoon. I'm prosecutor Emil Stoica. Go ahead. - What's next? - No, from the beginning. I'm Cristian Badea, doctor at the Pediatric Surgery Department of Hospital 147 in Bucharest. And I made this denunciation because I am dissatisfied with Septopharma products in the hospital. Septopharma is the largest manufacturer of biocides in our country. Their products end up in 350 hospitals and 2,000 operating rooms. Biocides are given in the hospital against bacteria, viruses and spores. They disinfect operating theatres and patient wards, surgeons wash their hands with them. The problem is Septopharma biocides are diluted. You have on file concentration test results from six hospitals in Bucharest. Because of dilution, the bacteria are no longer destroyed. On the contrary, they are helped to adapt and become immune to antibiotics. Patients die infected with Piocyanic or Staphylococcus aureus. I spoke to the hospital, I went to the ministry. And no one has taken any action. Because everyone they all get money from Septopharma. And hospital managers, and the heads of wards, and the head nurses, and the DSPs, and the ministry. There are nosocomial infections in many hospitals, but they are not reported. - We need to... - Excuse me, please. Go get the boss. - Nosocomial infections... - Can you hold, please? Would you like a glass of water? No, thank you. Chief Prosecutor Dorobanțu. I'm listening. From the beginning? Yes, please, from the beginning. I'm Cristian Badea, doctor at the Pediatric Surgery Department of Hospital 147 in Bucharest. And I made this denunciation because I am dissatisfied with Septopharma products in the hospital.

Septopharma is the largest producer of biocide and their products end up in over... Their products reach over... They produce biocides and their products end up in... They go all over the country. Only they're diluted. That's the problem... That they're diluted and that's why patients are dying from... Patients are dying from... Piocyanic. That's right. That's right. Patients die infected with Piocyanic and with... Patients die infected with Piocyanic and with... Excuse me. Patients die infected with... Throw him out! No, wait a minute. Good evening. Sorry to bother you. If you'll just take a moment to listen the word of God? No, thank you. It's nice, isn't it? What's nice? The sky. I don't know. How can you not know? I don't really look at the sky. It's right in front of you. So? When I look at the sky, I'm relaxing. Don't you? I get all crazy and shit. Do you smoke? I was thinking of quitting. Why? Afraid you'll die? An extra cigarette doesn't matter. Last one. And then you quit. Come on. Don't refuse me. Come on. Please. You cut yourself. Come with me.

I found something better to do. Better than healing people? Yeah. Killing people. Just kidding. Are you? What do you do? Now? Nothing. If you need a job... I can help you. It pays very well. You haven't asked me what my training is. You don't need training. What do I have to do? What you're doing now. Nothing. Sounds like a very easy job. On the contrary, it's very hard. This job comes with a price. You have to ask no questions. Just listen. That's how I started. I listened, I didn't ask questions. I was patient. And now look where it got me. I have my company, I have money, I have a family that I love and who loves me... And what's the downside? The downside... I don't sleep much at night. But I'm used to it. You'll get used to it. Never. That's what I said at first. But you know people get used to anything. It's just a matter of time. Take care of the little one in 15. Somebody watch him. Yeah. You want to come back? Yes, Professor. - Are you done with the scandal? - Yes. And don't you think you should apologize? I apologize. I'll talk to the manager and see how I can help you. Thank you. That's all. Professor... Do you have any questions? No. You'll make a good doctor. Doctor? I'm ready.
