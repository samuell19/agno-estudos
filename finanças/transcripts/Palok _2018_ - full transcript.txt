(song playing) THE FEATHER Hello! Listen, Anu... I'll go to your house tomorrow morning to collect the pen drive. I need it desperately. Will you be at home? Hello... Can you hear me, Anu? Why aren't you talking, Anu? Hello! Our marriage was indeed a blunder! But thanks for introducing me to Shruti. Shekhar! What the hell are you talking about? What do you mean by blunder? Cut the crap, Anu! Move on. I am leaving a paper here. Please sign it. Paper? What is it about? Divorce. Please listen to me. We've been together for the last 10 years... But this... Shekhar... Please hear me out, Shekhar... There is no point crying anymore. Please I can't take it anymore. I am moving out . Our relationship is over! Stop the car. Hmm? Stop the car. Madam, your drop location is after two lanes from here. Madam... are you listening? I am really, Anu. I was about to tell you myself. I thought your marriage was not working out. How could you do this to me, Shruti? You are my closest friend since childhood. Don't be silly, Anu. Move on. Shekhar was never happy with you. Consult a psychiatrist. Get over him. Believe me, both of us want the best for you. You took away the love of my life. Madam! If you have to die, get under someone else's car. You had to choose my car! Absolutely crazy! Shekhar! Uh! It's hurting! Anu will be here any moment. Ah!! Don't be so tense, Shruti. She won't come. She is sleeping. Anu! What are you doing here? Anu, I mean... Damn! What does this lady do! Damn! Hello! Uhh! Dont call me now. Told you I am at work. Hanging up. M-M-Malati... Malati... Malati! Damn it! Malati!! Why are you calling me so many times? Told you Didi is sleeping. I have a lot of work. Don't call me now. (humming) Hello! Listen, it's okay that you are calling me so many times. But it's an off day for her. She is sleeping. If I don't complete my work she will rebuke me later. Hang up, will you? Hello! Only Inox movie theatre... and popcorn too. Alright. Hello... Alright I am coming. Madam, I am leaving. Where is that 'you'? Oh! (song playing) Alright. Let's go. I mean... Many people have passed away today just like you. Shyambazar, Dumdum and many other locations. Gosh... Now, Barackpore gets included too. So much work to do! Die if you have to! But won't. For the last two days an 80-year old man is holding on. Hmph! Stay if you have to, otherwise come with me. But no. I have to travel all the way, up and down, everyday. Is it fair? Does it make sense? Tell me. What? Who are you? I can't recognise you. I am... Do you see this list? I have to take everyone from here. Understood? I mean, I am from up there. I am here from Yamraj's office. The God of death. You don't believe me. This is my visiting card. Do you see now? I have got the officer's job after passing a competitive exam. There is another exam soon. What difficulty! Let it be. Let's go. Have to travel a long way with a lot of people. Understood? Damn! What happened? Huh? I thought death is the solution to all my problems. But after dying I can't believe that I am really dead. What nonsense! What is the meaning of all this now? You should have thought about it before having those pills. Now, let's go! Do you have any last wish? Before leaving this world do you want to see anyone? What happened? I want to go up. I have been waiting to go up there for a long time. I mean to the terrace. Oh... To the terrace of this house? Let's go but make it quick. Time is running out. Get up now. Get up please! Come... Let's make it fast. Let's go. Oh, very slow. I was telling you about this terrace. Whenever I felt lonely... I used to come here and stand for a while. I used to feel very peaceful. I lost my parents at the age of three. (song playing) My uncle had brought me up. Studied in a hostel then started working. Didn't ever get the time to live for myself. You know, I loved Shekhar a lot. My life was centred around him. My support system. But when he left me... I lost everything. The wish to live as well. He is getting married next month... To my childhood friend. I am free now. There is only one regret. I couldn't be happy. If you trust me, then I can tell you a couple of things. There is a woman in a green sari, walking down the road. Have you noticed? Yes, I am talking about her. I was about to be summoned to her house too. She can't speak that's why she couldn't lead a married life for long. She had to listen to a lot of one sided talk. Didn't have the scope to speak, of course. So she became mentally ill and thought of taking the way out. Just like you. Then suddenly, she decided against it. She thought that she would live for herself. She got herself a job in a restaurant. She learned to be happy on her own too. You know what? You don't need much to be happy, madam! There, the man wearing red t-shirt who is pulling the rickshaw. Neither has he seen as much wealth as you... nor has he got the scope to be so educated. He didn't get the opportunity to while away his life enjoying melancholia, as you. Just find out if you can. Even at this age, he is taking his board exams. So that he could lead a better life. Do you know the truth, madam? Most of you didn't use the most important weapon of life. Which weapon? Hope... Hope... Ups and downs are a part of life... but hope is such a friend that if you hold its hand in the journey of life.. Then nothing comes in its way. Happiness also follows. Your friend is getting off the car. Will she be happy if she comes up and sees your dead body? I don't think so. Yes! Sritoma was supposed to come today to collect her pen drive. Now what will happen? I have made a huge mistake. Is there no other way out? If only I knew about all this before... You only have 15 seconds left... return to your beautiful world. If Sritoma comes and sees your dead body, even I won't be able to do anything about it. But what about the "up" there? I will take care of it. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Quarter to five... Half past four... Four... Half past three... Quarter past three... Three... Quarter to three... Half past two... Two... Half past one... Quarter past one... One! Uff! Really! The door is ajar. And she is snoring away! Get up! It's 9:30 in the morning! She is not even bothered. Look at the condition of this house! (inaudible) (distorted voice) You pay me every month, I will clean your house instead. It's so dirty! Don't feel like entering Get up now. Get up. What happened? You took so long to wake up... now are you going to keep staring at your room for five minutes? I am going to splash water on you now! Hey! Now this is too much! Will you give me my pen drive? What happened? Did you drink too much last night? How much did you have? Still hungover. I just cant believe it! Some time back, a man was here. A man was here? In your dreams... Please listen to what I have to say. A man had come. Again! A man had come! In your dreams. One minute... One minute. Wait. Huh... just look at her. Hey, where did you go? Uff! Why are you making me run so much right in the morning? What's the matter? Which man? When did he come? You won't understand. I don't want to understand. I am going downstairs to make us some coffee. Come soon! You don't need much... to be happy, madam! Ups and downs are a part of one's life... but hope is such a friend that if one holds its hands in the journey of life... then nothing comes in its way. (song playing) Hope... Hope! (song playing)
