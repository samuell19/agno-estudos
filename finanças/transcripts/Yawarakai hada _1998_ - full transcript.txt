Crime Information Bureau How are you on this peaceful afternoon? It's time for Crime Information Bureau's The Wanted. Our first news has been causing quite a buzz since this morning. There was a bizarre murder before daybreak in... a newly developed residential area at lbaraki Prefectures Tsukuba City The victims were a 48-year-old dentist, Natsume Kouchi, and his 42-year-old wife, Natsume Sachiko. Their bodies appear to have been cut into pieces with edged tools. The police suspect the murderer used a chainsaw for the crime. Their home has truly become the scene of a bloodbath. It resembled a horror movie, according to the report. The police are regarding the 17-year-old Girl-A, the only daughter of the Natsumes, who went missing shortly after the incident, as the prime suspect. The search is under way Girl-A was a well-behaved student with good grades at school. There are many comments saying she would never do such a thing. No, this Girl-A is almost certainly the culprit. Good students like her are unpredictable. This girl may be very dangerous right now. They should put her on the wanted list and release her real name and a photo! Make an exception to the juveniles law! Ignore it! The weapon used for the murders, a chainsaw, may still be in her possession, after all. A chainsaw, huh? The sound of a dentist's drill and a chainsaw are very similar, aren't they? Could that be a hidden message? I see... That is a sharp observation. Hey where are you headed? However, I cannot imagine anyone would murdertheir parents in such a brutal manner. What kind of family was it? L'd like to believe that families are all about love and caring, but isthat nothing but a fantasy in this day and age? That concludes the show for today See you again at the same time ne> SOFT SKIN Would you please reconsider? I'd lose face if something like that were to happen as well... You can't?

This morning, the body of Okada Shinichi, a 42-year-old long-haul truck driver, was found below a cliff near Chiba Prefecturés Choshi Highway Okada's body appears to have been cut into pieces with a chainsaw, and the time of his death was over a week ago. The police are linking this case with the bizarre murders of the Natsumes... in Tsukuba City earlier this month on the 5th, as they continue to investigate. The Natsumes' only daughter, the 17-year-old Girl-A, is still missing. This incident raises even more questions. Hey! Whatwould happen if we get even more casualties? 17-year-old Girl-A, my ass! What's more important? The juveniles law or human lives?! I have to agree... therefore, we at The Wanted have decided to use our own judgment... and release Gir/-A's picture and name. Of course, we expect a back/ash from this decision, however, we cannot let a murderer roam free, even if she is a juvenile! Wonderful! That's the spirit of news reporting. Behold, this is the suspect, Girl-A: Natsume Yuriko! Someone with such a cute face... did something so horrible. - I wonder where she ran to. - Somewhere... She wanted to go somewhere. Somewhere, huh? I know how she feels... I want to go somewhere, too! No one in your family called you in the last week, right? Is the spark of love we had back then forever lost? "Back then"? I used to be an actress. It was just for a youth association play in the countryside, but I was always the heroine. Tono was a fan of mine... I could feel his passionate gaze from the front rovv. We were in love, and Tono eventually proposed to me. But our parents were against the marriage, and one day... - You e/oped?! - That's right. It was like a dream. Like I was upgraded from a heroine on the stage to a heroine in real life. I was so happy We came to Tokyo, and the kids were born. - That's amazing! - No! The heroine in the past is nothing more than an old woman now. I want to just go somewhere, too! "Somewhere"? Somewhere I can shine... I want to be taken away like back then! What about your family? Make them wait. It's my turn to make them wait. What do you mean? Mom kidnapped. Return immediate/y Mom kidnapped. Return immediate-bx Wfhat is it'? ls it your Mom again? What is it? ls it your Mom again? Kidnapped? 'Nhar?! We kidnapped Tono IViinako. Wait for us to call you again. - Um... - Shh! I repeat, Minako is dead if you contact the police. Oh, no! Um... Keep this a secret. We can't let the police or other broadcasters know. Got it? - Yes. - Don't worry about the show. Just go home. - L'm concerned about you, so l'll come see you later. - Thanks. - Pull yourself together. - Okay See you. Kidnapped, huh? This is a big lead! Sugisaki! Time to get to work! They're all here... Everybody but me. How many years has it been? Let's contact the police. No! You don't care if they kill Mom? No... that's not good. But... why would anyone kidnap her? We have no money This is kinda cool. It's like a movie! Dad. Yes, this is Tono. Hello? Um... is my wife... ls she safe? We are The Great Japan Saviors of Mother's Soul. "The Great Japan Saviors of Mother's Sou/"? What kind of organization is that? Doesn't matter. Are all the family members with you'? Yes. Let me hear all their voices. Introduce yourselves. - They want us to introduce ourselves. - Huh? \/\/hat the hecK? Let's start from Dad, clockwise. I'm Tono Kenichi, 53. lam Tono Minakds husband. Tono Asuka. I'm her oldest child. Tono Ai. I'm 17 years old, in Grade 11. I'm the youngest in the Tono family Tono Hyuga. I'm studying to enrol in a university I'm her only son. That's all of us. Hello? Good. Sounds like you're all there. You passed the first test. Um... what is it you want? Just to let you know, we have no money /t's true. You can ask Minako. We don't want money What is it, then? The demand! Didn't you decide on one? Shoot! It's odd if I got kidnapped for no reason, huh? What do we do? I know: family The perfect family That's the vision of our organization! Iam the leader. Our demand is a perfect family I will contact you with details again. You were so cool! I would've mistaken you for a real kidnapper! Was I that good'? Asuka, you're part of the media. Have you ever heard of The Great Japan Saviors of Mother's Soul? No. Don't try to depend on me. Family? Family huh? The kidnappers are a group of extremists. They must have done this to protest the current state of Japan, where traditional family values are missing. I can sympathize with them in a way Don't be impressed by them! Let's search the house. - We might find some clues. - I'll take care of the kitchen! Get moving, guys. 0K3)'- - Any clues? - No. Wow! When did we take this picture? I look so beautiful in this. I forgot I used to have this hairstyle. It must be from when I first became a newscaster. This isn't the time for that. I'd say you look pretty handsome in this, too. Yeah? Let's see it. Oh, not bad. This is... from when I was still at the head office. You got demoted soon after this photo was taken, right? I didn't get demoted. - It was an ordinary transfer. - Don't try to fool me... Employees your age wouldn't get transferred away from the head office otherwise. It's common sense. So what about you'? You could've easily commuted to work, but you rented an apartment. I'm an independent woman. There's nothing wrong with living on my own. I bet you just wanted to bring men back to your apartment. - Don't talk about me like I'm a whore! - Calm down! All we do is argue all the time. How can we possibly be a perfect family? Hyuga, can you think of any reason why she was kidnapped? She paged me every day but I was busy with my studies, so I never called. What? ls that how you treat your mother?! So, did you call her? It's important for me to focus on work. You didn't call her either. Is that how you treat your wife? - What's with that attitude?! - Stop it already! - You seem happy - Of course! I haven't been this excited in at least 20 years! That's good. A romantic elopement... A romantic elopement! Oh, wow! It's like a festival in here! I'm sorry to keep you waiting. How's this? Whoa... isn't that a bit too flashy? Right? You're pretty much a sunflower! - Well, it's a once in a lifetime event. - Still, thafsjust too... - You're beautiful. - Really? You're really beautiful. Fine. We don't have time. Let's go with this costume. Ready? 0K3)'- All right, 5 seconds... 4, 3, 2... Tono Asuka reporting. This is Crime Information Bureau's The Wanteds special report. I'm in a quiet residential neighborhood in Tokyo's Suginami Ward. Tono Minako, 49, a housewife who lives in this house, was kidnapped by someone! She is my mother. The kidnappers are an extremist group that calls itself The Great Japan Saviors of Mother's Soul. They don't demand money but a perfect family instead. This absurd demand has shook up the Tono family! What exactly do they want?! And cut! - How was it? - You're trying a little too hard. - You're beautiful. Honey come over here! - Hey am I beautiful? - You are! Yay! That's great! You know, it's almost time to make another phone call. - What should l say thistime? - We'll leave that for later. - L'll come up with a script for you. - Really? A Sakura clam! A big wave! - I want to have a photo taken! - I have a camera! Really? That's great! Hi, excuse me! Hey! Hey excuse me! You over there! Please take a photo for us. Thank you. Just press the button. Please make sure the sea is in the background! Nice and pretty! Say cheese. Hello, is everyone getting along? Yes. By the way what is a perfect family supposed to do? You still don't get it? You people don't act like a family You're all on your own. If all families were like yours, then Japan would be ruined. Listen, the mother holds the family together. We cannot accept those who neglect the mother. Restore the family to the way it's meant to be. Okay we will do our best, but I don't know if we can satisfy you... At a time like this...?! Asuka, take the phone! - Hello, this is Asuka. - Yes, this is Tono. Oh, boss! There was a family issue... Please tell me, what do you hope to gain by doing this? I want to see... a perfect family You want to see it? It's not hard. Simply restore the family to the way it's meant to be. Don 't complicate it. Understood? I will contact you again. Yes. And cut. It's an impossible demand for us. I requested four days off. Yes. No, I really can't come to work today Two or three days... maybe longer. L'll explain later. Please let me off the hook for now. Yes. I got lonely so I came over! I can't have you here at a time like this. - That's why I got you these! - What are they? You have to eat right, especially at times like this! - But... - What's the matter, Hyuga? Are you his father? I have come to cheer you up. - Please leave! - Let her stay Please come in. - Dad... - She came to cheer us up. Where are your manners? Um... where have we met before? Perhaps in a previous life. That sounds like a line from a novel. I'm speechless! - Please, come in. - Thank you. I wish we could just live here... Watching the sunset, with the sea breeze gently blowing against us. And we'll pick Sakura clams every day What about on rainy days'? Let's kiss each other inside, all day! - What if there's a storm? - I'll risk my life to protect you. That brings back memories... Tono said a similar thing to me. I don't mind dying for you! - Kenichi! - Minako! Here you go. Excuse me. - Here you are. - You should work on your flavoring. Oh! It's so delicious! - L'm so glad you're here! - l'm glad you like my cooking! L'll keep making more, so eat all you like! We're not out for a picnic! - Sorry for making you do all this. - Don't worry about me! We're in a crisis. All of you should just focus on solving the kidnapping. L'll handle all the housework! Such devotion! She's an angel. Everyone, get ready Move over. Relax, everyone. Calm down, sir. - Okay - Ready? All right! 5 seconds. 4, 3, 2... It's a phone call. Could it be from the kidnappers? Hello? Let me hear my wife's... Minakds voice! Minako. Minako! Are you safe? Were you raped? Honey! Save me! The kidnappers are crazy Their group is driven by paranoia. Apparently they've been stalking me the whole time. They were upset by the neglect of myfamily so... ls their leader the one who ca//ed us? They have a knife against my throat. I can't tell you things like that. Please... do as they say Hello? Minako? Minako?! - Oh, no! - Why didn't you turn your cell phone off? Hyuga, take care of the rest! Hello? Mom? Oh no! Don't touch me there. No! No! Are you all right, Mom?! N-No! You can't! Oh, no... No! Please! Please don't fire me! Boss, give me some time. Just a little more! Very well... If you insist, I'll quit. How manly! Don't push your ideals onto us! Don't lay a finger on our mother. You'll be sorry! Hello? He... I may have angered the kidnappers. The kidnappers may be sexually abusing Minako! I could hear Minako screaming, "Help! No!" through the phone. I can't imagine how the family feels in such a situation. You sound like you want Mom to be raped for your show. - What do you want? - Binge-eating disorder? It's none of your business. - Nothing's staying in your stomach. - Shut up. You're just trying to escape from reality by eating. Look at all the vomit. You're so dirty Was that an orgasm? Your first time? You're becoming a woman. I'm getting more confidence... The pleasure of being seen. All the viewers are looking at me through the camera. You're beautiful. - This is destiny - I'm so glad. Now, you'll turn into a real woman. Look at me... Look at me! You're beautiful. - You're beautiful. - Look closer! Look at me! You're beautiful. How many years has it been since I was thisturned on? Same goes for me! It's so wonderful! Now you're an adult.

Some presents that aren't expensive, but with lots of love. And all the laughter. That's the kind of family that I wanted. I want to see a heart-warming family like that. Cheers! How corny What are we, playing house? Playing house?! Know your place! Ceremonies are important for family l can't possibly believe something like that would suddenly make her feel better. Your organization is pretty pathetic. Shut up! Don't take me for a fool! What's wrong? Hey look at my dress! Is it a bit too conspicuous for a kidnapped wife? But it's a birthday party so I guess it'sfine. - I'm scared! - What? I'm doing something serious here, right? If I took you back home, they'd come after me for kidnapping, right? Don't worry! If it comes to that, I'll testify and say we did it together! What if you betray me? You can't trust me? Hey lefsjust go somewhere! Let's live a happy life together! Are you crazy? The kidnapping game is over. We have to go back. I'm a housewife, after all. Everyone needs me there. Only for a while. Only for a while. Eventually they'll neglect you ancl get back to business as usual. Eventually they'll neglect you and get back to business as usual. You thinK? I can be your ideal lover! I'll even marry you! If that's what you want. You're too young. It's a miscasting. No one... No one casts me to be a part of their lives! You can't eat that yet! Welcome Home, Mom! It's beautiful. Do you thinkthis is high enough'? - Looks good. - Okay I'll tie it up! If it opened, then we have to close it again. Let's try it again. What? What are you doing to your father?!

Minako and I will start a new family so you should just all go back to your lives. I have always wanted a mother. I can take care of Minako better than you. Are you seriously saying something so childish? Minako and I are no longer strangers. L'm not being childish. We already have a mature relationship.

You can't make her a part of the family - So I'll... - Stop! Hello, it's me. Don't worry I'm safe. Crime Information Bureau Nice to meet you. I'm the new anchorwoman, Tono Ai. I will be replacing Tono Asuka on this show, starting today This is Crime Information Bureau's The Wanteds special report. Please watch this footage first. Ready? Everyone! I'm fine! Mom! Mom! Welcome home! Tono IViinako, a housewife in Suginami Ward, Tokyo, was kidnapped by an unknown individual. The incident was reported all over the media today but we've been following this story long before today We were able to capture this wonderful footage. I'm so glad you're safe! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm home! Happy birthday dear Mom. - Congratulations! - Look here! Mom. Happy birthday Thank you, Hyuga. Thank you, everyone. They had me blindfolded the entire time, so I don't know what the kidnappers looked like. Nor where they confined me. In the end, they left me by a road with the blindfold on. The kidnappers left in a car. They used voice changers too, so I can't describe their voices. I think it was a group of four or five individuals... but /'m not certain. I wonder why this happened to an ordinary housewife like me? It reminds us of something heart-warming that we have forgotten. I'm tearing UP! This reflects how peaceful it is in Japan! I agree. The Tono family faced the kidnapping with courage! Please continue to watch scenes of their bravery and love. They're beautifully arranged! You look much younger, Mom. Sorry to keep you waiting. It's time for tomorrow's weather. The Tokyo region will be sunny Forecasted high and low temperatures are as follows... You're beautiful. - ...and this. - Okay - The chainsaw girl is still out there. - Yeah. She's the same age as me. Have you ever wanted to kill yourfamily? I was busy eating all the time. You were just a baby back then, right? But now I'm all grown up! It's a quiet night, Mom. What are you doing out here? Nothing. What about you'? I'm doing nothing, too. We're the same. The sea is sparkling from the starlight. You're right. It's beautiful. Yeah. Hey... Wanna go somewhere? Somewhere? Where? Somewhere, huh?
