THE CHRISTMAS FAMILY My name is Hugo Christmas and I love Christmas. It's the best time of year. I wish it was Christmas forever. What the hell are you doing? Idiot! - Dad? It was not the real Santa. - No, the real Santa does not exist. My father is Niels Christmas and he hates Christmas... ...and every year he promises to pull himself together. - Hello. - It should be a huge one. - A big Christmas tree, thank you. - It will be. - It's the last one, you get it for 400. - 400? You're kidding, right? Yes, but good luck finding another spruce now. ...sacred moment. Angels here beats his drum. This is where I live. Do you see any Christmas decorations? No, huh? Dad is the most worried I know. If he had to decide, it would be summer all year long. - Will you not come in? - No elf in here, you know. - Dad, it's Christmas Eve. - Yes I am coming. The first who got the crazy idea to take a spruce and dress it was the Germans. - Year 1605. - We're not a class you're going to teach. You know what? Next year we will skip Christmas and go to a tropical island. - Calm now. - Then I want to! Who would not want that? What have I done? - Hugo said you gave the plot your finger. - He stepped out in front of the car. - Stop! - You have the sickest Christmas girl. Are you afraid of a peppermint too? No, I'm not. My father is so worried that we've never had a real Christmas. Now we're going to talk. I do not want to talk to you. I do not even want to celebrate Christmas with you. So, now we are talking. Here you go. Just wait a moment. There. - No thanks. - You eat. Now it's exciting who gets the almond. Is there anyone who has got the almond? Do you have it Hugo? What? - I got it. - No, you did not get it. - Yes, I got it. - No, you did not get it. No. No, it was a miss. There were two halves. Want a little more, Hugo? Are you okay? Are you okay? I wish we could just have a real Christmas. - Are you expecting someone, Vega? - No. - That's weird. - It's snowing. Look, that's nice footsteps! That's the neighbor's dog. Is anyone here? Hello? - What happened? - There is a guy in the parallel class. - What does he write? - Okay, do you want to see? If you want us to see it. - Maybe that's a bit too private. - View now. Okay, then you'll see. "Merry Christmas. Regards, Tobias." Hi. Want to see my Christmas gift? It's a robot vacuum cleaner. What...what are you doing? It's an elf trap. An elf trap? What do you have? - Catching wicked elves? - They are not bad. They are neither evil nor good. For they are not real. Yes, because I have seen true elf footprints. - I do not get to see your Christmas gifts? - Yes, when I catch an elf. - Then you'll have to wait a long time. - I'm going to do that too. Alfred, may daddy see your helicopter? FAMILY CHRISTMAS Christmas? Unfortunately I have to go. Bring the kids to the Christmas tree in the square tomorrow. - ...Yes... - I hope you survive. - See you. - See you. Mom often works on Christmas Eve. It's because she works for the police. Pixy? Pixy! - Pixy! Pixy! - Pixy! Pixy! Pixy? Pixy! Hope there will be more snow. Should we have a snowball fight then? I have to write an essay that will be ready after the holidays. - Geek. - Loser. Dad? I really want to go to that Christmas tree in the square. Hugo, I can not handle more. - Help me find my old friend. - Your old friend? Yes, come. Many old things are here. Rutat RÄKNEHÄFTE. - Is it from when you walked in? - Yes. Add it back again. - Did you draw this? - Yes. There we have my old friend. He has used me very much. "Julnissen"... - What? - Julnissen. - As a boy, I was called that. - Julnissen? Yes, Niels became "nisse" and with Jul as the last name, it became ... Julnissen? Were you teased then? Yes. - There is an elf! - Where? Right there. Shall I iron it? Elves do not exist. Those who believe in elves are those who go to kindergarten. Those who attend school are interested in real things. Are you coming? Hugo. Hello? You may want to come down to my room and stay there. If you want. - Has everyone started the Christmas holidays? - I have. - There is a living elf in the attic. - Stop Hugo. - No phone when we eat. - You're getting nothing. - I saw a live elf in the attic! - Stop. No, it's true. - Do you know what "rats in the attic" are? - Not rats or mice, an elf. There are no elves. No, it does not! Why does no one believe me? Have you taken it from our door? My name is Hugo Christmas. What's your name? - Hugo? - It's Dad. He hates elves. If he discovers you, then ... - Do you not come to others? - Well, I'll just do something first. Okay? I'm going now. You wait here, I'll come back later. Okay? Good night, old man. Sleep tight. Come and eat. If you're here, come out. Hello? Have you slept down there? I was afraid you had gone home. What is your real name? "Tissys Pixlys"... I can not speak elvish. - ...Pixy. - Your name is Pixy? Are you going to pee? I'll take a men's jacket to you. And I have some money so we can buy some food. Come! Have you never really cycled before? Isn't that awesome? That's Frida in my class. - You can not be two on a bike! - Mom, they are two on a bike! - Do not yell! Just the leaves shout so! - Yes, but they are two on a bike! Look! There is a clean one. Reindeer are elve's pet? Can you talk to it? My greatest wish is a very clean one. You should go home and take your shoes! Isn't it cold at all? What's that? Is that true elf snow? I met the Christmas heart there. Was it you who got the snowball to meet the aunt? Elf Snow with hit guarantee. Cool! - You're welcome. - Thanks. They do not have rice pudding here, but eat this, it is human food. - Mom, look! He only has four toes! - Do not sit and point. - That's strange. - Do not sit and point, honey. Now you will not be sad? Have your little parents gone home without you? Do you have any parents? Are you a flock? So, now we look like two boys with elf pants. You can stay in my room. But my dad can never see you. Exactly. He hates elves because he was teased as a child. His name is Niels Christmas and he was called "Julnissen". - Good morning. - Good morning. - Are you ready to start school again? - Yes. Dad, I do not like rullsylta anymore. Can not I get spicy sausage instead? I thought you liked rullsylta. I know it's you. - But I will not let myself be provoked. - Sorry, Dad. You must not take our door plate and not annoy my father. Immediately Alfred comes in to pack his school bag. And then we tell him to stay here in our room. Okay? Hi. Hugo, have you seen my eraser? - There is a kid here that is invisible. - Yes, Hugo, Christmas is over. Seek help. - Who are you? What are you doing here? - It's an elf. I do not know who you are, but if you do not stand, I'll hit you in the face! It's not true. Where is he? Pixy! Your gym clothes are on the couch. Alfred, can you take out the garbage? - I'm doing it. - Remember, we sort the garbage. Pixy! Pixy! Is he out here? Then we will not see him again, that's for sure. Pixy? Good to have you here. - Dad is coming! - We have to go away. Get ready now. - No, I have to go. - And I'm waiting for Alfred. Okay sure. But do not come too late. See you at school. Hey. What is he doing here? Elves do not exist. - Pixy stays because he loves Christmas. - It's not Christmas anymore. He thinks we celebrate Christmas forever because we are called Christmas. Then you've come to the wrong family. Alfred, wait! Alfred, wait! Alfred, wait for me! We need to know how the elf comes home. Maybe in a portal to another world. - He will live in our room. - What happens if dad notices? You end up in an orphanage and I lose my friends and end up in the psych hospital. And what had happened to Vega then? - Hello. What are you talking about? - Hello. Nothing. Famous soccer players. Hi, Tobias. Fun that you are interested in nature and technology, the basic conditions of our planet. - If that does not matter? - What? If there is a kid at school. And nobody knows what he can do. Stop Hugo. You continue, even though I asked you to end the Christmas season. Go now. Good morning! Solveig is sick, so I'm your substitute. My name is Niels. I have brought a green frog and two salamanders. I took them to the school's nice collection of naturalities. ...a strong long-legged frog. - It can be as long as... - Dad? A green frog is a real food glutton. - It can eat a lot of insects. - Merry Christmas, Niels Christmas! Yes, my name is Christmas. Niels Christmas. That is correct. Do any of you know the food chain? What's so funny? Is that you, Hugo? Which one of Satan's chicks has done this?! - ...an elf...? - What's up? - Dad? - Niels? Niels? Move, Hugo. Niels? Breathe now. Hugo? - He must not say he sees elves. - Yes, he gets it. - Help, an elf! Help! - Stop! Let it be! What is it? If dad would just believe in elves, this would never have happened. I know how the elves are. The less you believe in them, the more they bush. What is he doing here? He may not be in this house. Elves loves to play. - We have to do something. - Can you go out? I need to rest. Yes. - Hey Pixy. - Hey. - Do you want to join? - No, he should not even be here. - He must find another place. - Do not take hands, just kick. Are you with the national team? - What the hell is the meaning? - Frida's mother. Make you invisible! Are you the one who has shot at my greenhouse?! Hello, you there! Who are you?! You should not shoot balls at the greenhouse! Dad, I have three which worked with ... Not now, Alfred. It's hard to concentrate when you're home. I have a great job about the universe. Can we not have the caravan as a homework cafe? Clearly they will have a place. After all, they are the petals that one day will make real flowers. - Then I can help them with the homework. - No. You'll be off. Okay, Pixy. You can live outside, but may not be in the house or in the garden. - You'll be here. - In your hideout. You're going home as soon as possible. - Pixy may stay here forever. - No, he will not. - Oh, a sweetie! - Oh, it smells badly disgusting! I'm coming in in a bit! Good day inside the homework cafe. - Yikes, what it smells like. - Sorry, it's me. Too much candy. How are Neptune and Pluto and Saturn and Uranus and...? It's fine. - What homework do you do, Hugo? - I practice plus counting. And minus. Alfred has just learned how to do minus. Yes...I just wanted to see how it went. Good thing you were not discovered. Show Alfred what you can do with this. How did you do it? Do it again. - Calm, mom, drive to the station. - Jump in, I'll drive you home. What has happened? Why did you call? Are there any of those boys again? - He's that cute freckled then? - He's gotten together with Rosa. Well. Fuck him then. Try this one. Okay. - Bad cop. - Respect! - I'm driving back. See you later, Vega. - Yes, see you, mom. Alfred? Hugo? I told the school psychologist that an invisible elf in the garden scared me. - Elves are fairytales and are not real. - But he has been here since Christmas. Some elves give luck, but if they are mistreated they seek revenge. - Can he not go home? - He came from the other elves. Do you not hear how crazy that sounds? - No elves when it's not Christmas. - Give it to me! Come and take it, Hugo Julnisse. If you gossip, you get a slap. Hi. What are you doing here? - A child was stabbed from the refugee center. - He may have access to your caravan. - Yes, Mrs. Knudsen called us. - Frida's mother. Then I understand. Our children use it as a homework café. - You have not seen any children in the caravan? - No. - You have not seen anyone in the house either? - No. Then we regret that we bothered you. - Have a nice day. - Thank you, the same to you. Bye. - Why are you not asleep? - Is it illegal to have elf accommodations? No, I have not heard anything about that. Sleep well now, my darling. - Good night. - Good night. There will never be anything. Do you know why? I am surrounded by amateurs and idiots. Blockheads and nitwits. No energy, no willpower. It's always something. SMALL FRY! Lord jeez! What do you say now, Egon? Damn good, huh? He's great fun. His name is Egon. I'm fine, but, Egon, you're crazy. What, Egon? Fantastic, Egon. You have learned to speak the human language. Can you say "blockhead and nitiwt" too? All your stress leaves your body. You are completely relaxed. Your eyelids are heavy. Your mouth, your chin, your shoulders become heavy. All your problems will leave you. You are completely relaxed. - What the hell is the meaning? - Look! - God damnit! - What has happened? We will find out. There are immigrants, but your mother will send them home. Think about what you are saying. Send them back to where they came from! Do not be so racist. Come, Vega. You will slowly return. You are completely relaxed. Feel how you're filled ... Pixy has broken the robot vacuum cleaner. - Pixy, you must leave us now. - No. He must learn to behave. He behaves well and has learned the human language. - Fantastic, Egon. - How clever. Why? He is an elf. It is good to be able to speak the language anyway. Can you say how old you are? Can you write it in numbers? - 101 years. - Are you sure? But you're an elf, huh? Dad feels awful and can not work. And whose fault is that? Come in! - Hey, Hugo. - Hey. - What can I do for you? - Dad fainted because I acted up. No, your dad fainted because he was not himself. - Well, he just does not like Christmas. - No. - Go back to class, Hugo. - Not until Dad gets back to work. As long as your dad is so stressed, I can not let him teach. Yes, you can. - Why are you sneaking? - Dad's sleeping and we must be silent. And we have to behave. No noise. - You know who did this, huh? - Yes, Pixy, and it's dirty. It's Rudolph. It's my Christmas gift from Pixy. Pixy is completely crazy in the head. A giant animal destroying all the furniture. - It's my own clean. - No, it is not. Here, come. Come. Out. Out. Come. - Can it not be in the garden? - Are you crazy! It's the police. Hello guys. - Where does that animal come from? - We have never seen it before. - It suddenly stood out in the street. - Did it make it? Are you two not Agnetes children? - Hugo and Alfred, where did the reindeer come from? - From the forest. It must have gotten lost. Why did Frida see it in our house? - No clue. - Me neither. I do not believe you. I dare not think of Dad's reaction if he saw it. Pixy can not stay here anymore. - He must find another family. - No. - Do you prefer a dad or an elf? - Both. Then Dad can easily run the risk of dying from a heart attack. - So Pixy can not live with us anymore? - No, he can not. Not even if he is my best friend? - Run him far out in the woods in the morning. - No. Take him to a bus stop then, he can find his way home to the North Pole. It must be in the direction of the North Pole. Goodbye, my dear friend. You have no ticket, so you have to make yourself invisible. Happy journey home! I'll miss you very much. And I'm terribly sad. Are you okay, boy? Are you sure? Hello my darling. Where have you been? Hugo, we just talked to your dad. I think he should come back to school, as we talked about. - Have a good one. - You too. See you, Hugo. Come with you. Is that not great for him? What? Come! - Well done, Hugo. - No, it is not. - Yes, you made a very wise choice. - Only Pixy was here. What we did was really mean. Here. It's yours now. - Mine? - Yes, because you're a cool little brother. Could you not find home? Okay, you can stay here. But Alfred does not know anything and does not make trouble with my dad. Okay? Come. Pixy has lived in the caravan since last winter and no one has seen him. Not even Alfred. Pixy does not like the sun at all. But then it's good that he has his elf bag with elf snow. Here comes Alfred! Hi. Shall we play? I can not wait till we're going tomorrow. I'll catch butterflies. Do you want to join? What was that? Is it Pixy? Is it? Sorry, but he did not find home. - You kept it a secret from me. - You said he could not live here. - He must leave here now. - He has nowhere to go. Clearly Pixy will come along on vacation. He can not stay home completely alone. It would have been cruel. Now you are almost finished. I want to take a look at the area. Will anyone join? - Not right now. - I want to. - The rest of you then? - No, I do not want to. Sit here. You're hot, you poor thing. Now I'll take it off. Come on now. How awesome it is. What does Pixy do here? What the hell is going on here? - Pixy, you must also have sunscreen. - An elf with sun cream? Are you crazy? - I think we should say that. - No. - Then I will say that. - We will vote for it. Who thinks we should tell Mom and Dad? Who does not want us to tell? Pixy, you have no voting rights at all. He must look like a regular boy. Do we not have a pair of scissors? Come on, Pixy. Now we go shopping for ice cream. - Ice cream! - Hey. - Hey. You can choose two different varieties. - Yes, that one is sold out. - You'll have to choose another one. - There's nothing left of it. - Blockhead! - What did you say? - Blockhead! Idiot! Miserable socialist! You're excused. He's a little crazy. Dick! Pixy, you have to treat others well and say good things to them. Merry Christmas! You do not say that in the summer, but that was fine. This is life. Is that not the boy you're playing with? Can you not come here? Hi. What's your name? His name is Egon. - I think Egon can answer himself. - Where do you live? Over at the playground? And the elf hat? Where does it come from? - ...Well, it was... - Are you Hugo? - Seriously! You tried to expose him. - Stop, Pixy. Behave like a human being We do not throw snow in the summer. Come on, Pixy, get dressed. We're going out into the water. A small step for the elf, a big step for the elf race. Is it not nice? 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70... ...80, 90, 100! Alfred! Help! Where is he? Alfred! - Alfred! - Help! Help. Help! Pixy? You saved my life. Forgive me for all the stupid things I have said. That's disgusting! Elf sweat. - Alfred? Pixy? - Hey. How many liters can you drink? Hey. Here I would need some elf magic. So? Is it you? Your wretched socialist. Jackass. Where do you live, boy? Which is their tent? Your father and mother? - He's with us. - Yes, we are a family. Okay...? Okay, but then you will have fun. - Take care in the sun. Have a good one. - Ditto. Come on, Pixy! For Newton, the universe was a machine that ruled the movements of the celestial bodies. Hugo must have new pants. He's getting so big. Everyone starts to get so big. Fortunately, we do not have three pygmies. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Are you not enrolled with three children? - Yes. - Why are there four with you? - We don't. We have three. - Not a fourth tanned boy? - No, we do not have that. Okay, but you'll be sorry. So, what was that about? - I must have more. - Then it's over, do not come back. Will you be colder? - Have you found the elf bag? - No, we've been looking everywhere. - Hey buddy. You should not be here. - I want to go home! Are you okay? Have you got sunstroke? Where do your parents live? Christmas. - We are on vacation. What is this about? - Just follow me for a moment. - The boy said he lives with you. - Yes, anyone can say that. - So he does not? - No. Your children say you live together. I have nothing and do not want anything to do with him. I would like to pay the bill. Niels Jul? Would you please come? Pixy! Pixy! Dad! It's crazy when you sweat, huh? What's your name? - Pixy. - Pixy? Last name? - What's his name? - I do not know. I do not know him. Can you please write your name? Can you write how old you are? - 101? - It must be a 1-digit too much? Pixy...where do you live? - At my place? - No he does not. - When did you meet the boy for the first time? - I met him at the campsite. - Why was Pixy with you there? - Because he was playing with my children. We believe that the boy entered the country illegally and that he lives with you. We have a reasonable suspicion that Pixy went with you from Zealand. - It's pure madness! - Can you explain how it's connected? I have not done anything! - I want out of my family. - Well, calm down now. I do not know this boy. I have my own children. I do not want anything to do with this boy! No, but now we are investigating the matter. - There is nothing to investigate. - In the meantime, we will stay with you. You do not have the right to do that! Can you please sit down? I work for the police. It's a big misunderstanding. - Yes, our father has not done anything. - We want to talk to him and the boy. Yes...Come on child. Pixy is not a normal boy. He is an elf. He needs his elf snow. Otherwise he does not tolerate the heat. - Hugo? - Get lost. - Is he sent home? - No, Dad is going home with us. Not Dad - Pixy. I called my boss, so he is released. We need to find Pixy. Come on. Where is he somewhere? Shit! Pixy! Pixy? I have your elf snow. What are you doing? You can not be here. - We are visiting our friend. - He is driving to the refugee center immediately. He must have this. - No, he must not. - Yes, he must. Now can you be nice and go? This is not a playground. Come on. Come now. No, let me be! Let me go! Pixy! There he is! Beware! Here, Pixy. - Bend the gallows, Pixy. - Come on, use all your powers. - Otherwise, you will be sent to a warm country. - Where the sun is shining all the time. - Did he die? - Get mom, it's an emergency. ...Mom! - Wait. - Yes? - Hurry up, something happened! - What happened? - That is the boy. What is he doing here? - He's got sunstroke and will die soon. Okay. - What happened? - How cool. Pixy? They are looking for Pixy. There he is. Pixy, you know what to do? - Niels? - I'll report this. I've slept badly and I got disgusting food. All because of the boy! - ...but, Niels... - He's an elf. Niels? What are you doing here? What happened? - He's been here a long time. - It's he who's been busy. Who's making trouble...? So... - ...I'm going out with the dog. - With the dog? But, Niels, the dog died many years ago. - Yes, but I'm going out with him anyway. - Balder, come on. - ...Niels...? - Balder. Dad? Dad? Can not you understand that Pixy is a real elf? Because he is. But you have become too old to believe in elves. Do you think he's a real elf now? Do not be afraid. He does nothing. We did not really know before. My name is Niels. - Christmas? - Yes, you're right, that's our name. Christmas! Christmas! Christmas! Christmas! Christmas! Christmas! Is it fun to fill 102 years? It's been very nice, but I have to get it to a workshop to look under. Why can't Pixy just lift it? Isn't he tough? - My colleagues will come. - Quick, put it down! - Hey. - What now? - What is it about? - Pixy. - He's wanted. Can we take a look? - Yes, of course. Please, can you go out? I'm going to poo. Oh! - ...102 years? Well, I must say. - It's for the children's grandmother. Wow! We have to go back to the station. - Then I'll follow you out. - Thanks. No! What are you doing? - I just wanted to taste. - Shame on you. An old girl's cake. Yeah... Congratulations. Does it taste good? "They're training shoes," said the spider. - Hello. Can I join in? - Yes, of course you can. Should we not read a chapter? - Now you are the mother of four. - Yes. - It's great weather today. - Agnes and Tobias are together. I would never have thought so. - Thank you for the food. - You're welcome, Pixy. Unbelievable how fast he learns the rules. He is from a completely different world... ...and yet adapted to our lifestyle. It's really impressive. Thank you for the food. Have you learned to brush your teeth? That's not toothpaste. This is toothpaste. - No, that's enough now, take it away. - Mom, it will melt soon. Christmas? It's Christmas soon. Thank you for following me to school. Hey. Do you want a boyfriend for Christmas? I'll start in 6D. Do you know where it is? Ehm... Well... Then it's 12 days until all hell breaks loose. 12 days until crazy people with gifts and elf caps. It is absolutely unbearable, but we have to suffer through it. What, Niels? You have become so balanced that I hardly recognize you. I've got a little different view on nature and technology. Yes, but it requires enough explanation, Niels. You can also say that everything can not be explained. - Do you know why I'm wearing this? - No. Keep this one. Elf hat, Hugo Julnisse. - We will not do it anymore. - It's funny. Stop! Who are you? You look like a clown. He is very strong. He can crack your skateboard. Can you do that? Okay, break it then. But if you can not, you will get a slap. Do we agree? Thanks. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - We're gonna have a huge spruce, huh? - What about this? - Do you like Christmas now? - Yes, we'll see. But I wish we had some more Christmas decorations at home. How in the world...? - You wanted it yourself. - Yes. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve. Imagine if Pixy's elf family says he's going home. Imagine if he can not live with us anymore. Alfred? Dad wanted to travel abroad at Christmas. - Shouldn't you be in your bed? - We are going abroad for Christmas. We'll travel far away and Pixy will join us. - What has happened? - Come here. Come here, little troll. Merry Christmas. What about the Christmas tree? Is it big enough? - It's true. - So he fell off the chair. It's not good! Then it is certainly time for the rice pudding. - So there. - It is true rice pudding. Wow! You look good today, Mom. Is this your favorite day today? Do you have an elf drink? Is there anyone who has got the almond? - How lucky you are! - Then you get your almond gift. Yes, for you are the one losing. Fantistic, Egon! It was I who chose the hat. Will you wear it every day? Who could it be? Is anyone here? Dad, look. It's an elf footprint. Elf footprint? Yes, it actually looks like that. - They seem to have gone again. - No, Dad, they're hiding. No I do not think so. Come on. - I'll take the chance. - Good, Vega. Come on, shoot! - I'm shooting. - Almost. - Well done, Pixy. - They won. Shall we get another one? - Pixy! - Pixy? Your elf family is here. That's because they miss you, huh? You're going home now. Can't you stay here anymore? That's cheating. It's been so nice to have you here. Imagine what you've done with such a Christmas hat like me. I really hope you will be back next year. Hugo, my friend. Pixy loves you. - ...Pixy! - Pixy! Pixy! Pixy! Pixy! Pixy! Pixy is lucky to go home to his own country. I'm sure to miss him very, very, very much. But I know we'll meet again next Christmas. I know that completely inside my heart. And you know what? I'm also lucky. For now, my family also likes Christmas. Have a Merry Christmas!
