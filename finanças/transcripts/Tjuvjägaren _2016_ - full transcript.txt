Are we supposed to live here? Yes, because no one wants to house us. -We will freeze to death. -It's either here, or the poorhouse. My loom! How will we manage? So… Well… What-- -It's going to rain. -Then you'll have to keep hunting alone. It is my duty to distribute tomorrow's letters, and for that, I want to be healthy. You go. I will get the deer by myself. Let's have a look. Here is the first design I would like a pair of. Oh! And here is the other design. Do you have any thread for the lace, madam Countess? I have thread for the lace. I have two different white ones. Do you have anything I can put the fabric and patterns in? I would like this to be done discretely. I want you to work on the undergarments here. Very well. Yes. Would your husband find it embarrassing? No, not Lasse. -Is he even aware that you are here? -No, he does not. He's out in the woods. Would he disapprove if he knew what you are going to sew? No, but it's still best not to say anything. How come the hinges on this conveyance still haven't been corrected? Only an imbecile like you would be unable to mend it during my long absence. Why did I ever hire you, I wonder? My coat needs mending. -Welcome home. -Thank you. How was your journey to Stockholm? Up until this moment, quite excellent. I assume everything has been fixed as per my instructions in the telegram. -Certainly, Lord Baron. -Very good. Bring the suitcases inside. Well, I am relieved. The struggle is finally over. Without this agreement, things could have ended in a serious conflict. Some of us are blessed with natural talents. "A bit of charisma will get you far," my father would say. What's the latest on your feud with that pig-headed Lasse in the Mountain? Lasse? Are you saying that anarchist is still living out in that cave? Yes, seems like it. There's a lot of talk about him down in the village. He doesn't seem to be very well liked. I loathe his very existence. Everyone in the village knows that he poaches in my forests. Calm down. He's just a poor fool, and not worth wasting your energy on! By the way, do you really believe he would stop poaching just because you make him move out of the cave? I will not let a caveman make a fool of me. How would it look if I let an anarchist do as he likes in my forests? No, no, no. That kind of lawlessness is contagious. Before we know it, the whole village will run around in my forests. Lasse must be removed. It's a matter of principle. But how? I'm a lawyer, not a counsellor. Farmer Pettersson can have Lasse ejected, since the cave is on his land. But as far as I can tell, your good relations with this landowner are long lost. Pettersson hates me. The Countess, on the other hand, is on good terms with him. Maybe the two of you could have a diplomatic conversation about Lasse? Make her convince Landowner Pettersson that Lasse needs to be removed. And use the Countess as a Trojan horse? -Yes, indeed. -I appreciate your way of thinking. -Just ginger? Anything else? -No, thank you. Is Lasse coming down with something? Guess not. Well, Lasse controls the wind and weather. -He could never get ill, could he? -Well, actually he can. And you know what a man with a cold is like. Thank you. Thank you. My, oh, my! When was the last time you came into the village? Only last Sunday. I come here every Sunday. Sunday services don't count. When was the last time you had coffee with someone? I'd rather not visit, because I know that people talk about us. Is it true that you couldn't pay your way? No, that's not true. Did you really believe that? Not me, but… We paid, but nobody wanted to house us anyway. My life was easier when we lived in the village, but I'm not complaining, Ida. That's you in a nutshell, Inga. You're always in good spirits, even when the going gets tough. Remember your first winter? You barely had any food, and you were so cold your teeth were chattering. Still, you stayed in the cave. Very nice! Don't worry. You have always been the perfect hostess. And the most beautiful hunter of us all. The natural centre of attention during the fall hunt. I must come up with something new this time. Make the annual deer hunt interesting again. It's more important that your guests feel safe. As I was saying… Wouldn't it be marvellous if you, My Lady, and your party could move freely in the woods without risking life and limb? But surely, Lasse in the Mountain is no murderer. He has a short temper, and a rifle. He moves around freely. It would be rather unfortunate if a director or an auditor lost his life in a hunt hosted by you. I'm only thinking about your good reputation. Our social stratum can't afford to let anarchists gain a foothold. Lawlessness is contagious, wouldn't you agree? Oh, well. Maybe you're right. Write down that I have to speak to the landowner. A request from you will no doubt have the desired effect. Terrific! Bon voyage! -Postmaster Lagergren. -Yup. You go hunting with Lasse, don't you? Yes, I do. On occasion. Why do you ask? I'm going to tell you something. That man over there is the most skilled lawyer in the Skaraborg district. Next time you see Lasse, you tell him that poaching on my territory will have far-reaching consequences. Postmaster Lagergren. If I were you, I would avoid going hunting with Lasse in the future. It would be very unfortunate if you lost your position. "Dear mother and father. I hope you are in good health, and that the money we sent will come in handy. We are all well. There is no lack of work for anyone as manpower is in high demand everywhere. If only you could join us here in America… and see all the opportunities that are available." Lasse is dying! You say that every time you have a cold, Lasse. The children send their regards. Could Lasse please get something warm before Lasse dies? The soup is probably ready. Eat carefully, because it's hot. -It doesn't have any flavour. -No wonder, when you have a cold. There's both ramsons and ginger in it. More heat! We are outcasts. People don't dare to come here. I miss our children. Let's go to America! To our children. Life is good here. -Hunting puts food on the table. -Yes, when you're successful. Sure, you're right. There's no landlord who can throw us out. But we used to be part of the village. So, you haven't actually seen Lars Eriksson with a prey? No, I haven't, but I heard-- No more stories or gossip. Have you seen Lars Eriksson hunt in the northern forest? No, I haven't, but I seem to recall that Kröken… That drunk? He hasn't been sober for a whole day since '76. I would hardly call a drunkard like him a… -Good afternoon, Sheriff. -Vicar. Well, as I was saying, he's not exactly reliable. I guess I will have to gather information somewhere else, then. Thank you. And when your husband sobers up, give him my regards. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Ah! Any results? I'm terribly sorry, but I was unable to obtain a reliable testimony. It's as clear as day that Lasse is engaging in poaching on my land. -Everyone knows that! -Yes, but… I can't arrest someone without proof. Damn it! Oh, well. Lasse must be caught red-handed, I take it. Very well, then! Here's something to warm you up, Lasse. Thank you. We can't go hunting together for a while. Sheriff Nordensson is investigating the poaching. I don't want to get caught, and neither do you. So, here's what we'll do. We're going to lie low until Nordensson has calmed down. I don't give in to anyone. Leaving already? Where are you going? You're not well yet. When will you be back? -They're not too thin, are they? -No, not at all. You are very kind, Mrs. Eriksson. I hope I can repay your kindness by helping you move back into the village. Can I write it down as work-clothes? You do that. In certain districts, that's what they are. Out of my way! -I'm going home. -Not so fast, Lasse. I would just like to have a look at your magnificent prey. Well, well! Oh, yes! Now, that's what I call a bull's-eye. -Wouldn't you agree, Nordensson? -Absolutely, Lord Baron. That's a nice, clean shot. It's just a pity that there's been a slight misunderstanding. You see, Lasse… This here… This is my property. Every single tree that you see around here belongs to me. As well as the animals in the forest. -But you don't hunt. -No, not as often as you do. I'm sure you understand, that as a Baron, I have more pressing commitments. Lasse. You will have to pay me a bounty for the roe deer you shot on my land. Or, you will leave your prey here and go with Sheriff Nordensson. Lasse hunts where he wants, how he wants, and when he wants! I have no damn money! Go! Get him. What the-- -I think they're doing well. -Well, let's hope so. -They don't exactly write home frequently. -Oh, really? But I actually got a letter the other day. With money in it. So, you can thank them for the coffee. They're probably busy settling over there, in America. What was the name of that handsome fellow who moved overseas a few years back? Arvid Jonsson. Arvid, that's right. The most handsome man I've seen in years. Deep blue eyes, and big strong arms. And let's not forget that deep, resonant voice of his. Jesus! Made me tingle all over. Remember when the whole village community went skinny-dipping? Now we're talking! Please don't talk like that when we're having coffee. Sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Help yourselves! Ida says you're expecting a visitor this summer. How is the little girl? Well, I have to say that Gerda is doing very well in school. But she has some trouble at home, so she will stay with us all summer. How nice. What are you doing?! -The girl? -Yes. She's going to stay with us all summer. One more mouth to feed. Too cramped. You tell them that! That you ruined my coffee party and scared away my friends, I can live with, Lasse. But our grandchild, she is always welcome here. Give me a complete explanation. Have you ever thought about the meaning of the word "warden" in "game warden," and what it actually means? You have no idea, do you? All the poaching that's taking place in my forest. Look me in the eye! Do you take your profession seriously? Very well. Then listen very carefully, goddamn it. I require discipline. No more amateurish behaviour. The violation of my forest needs to cease immediately. It is naturally of the utmost importance that you keep your eyes on that Lasse character-- Is this some kind of mine? An attempted assassination! This is a… -It's-- -Do you have a speech impediment? -Spit it out! -It's one of Lasse's traps. One of Lasse's traps? You incompetent imbecile! Even cattle would do a better job than you. Why didn't you tell me? You should have cleared the forest and informed me of their existence. If you wish to keep your position as the forest gnome, I advise you to clear the forest. You immediately need to locate every single trap and disarm them all. Get some villagers to help you, if need be. You have until sunrise. The sun is setting. Shouldn't we wait until tomorrow? The Baron wants us to get rid of all the traps immediately. -Is that understood? -Understood. Ugh! Yuck! Ugh! My God! -One more? -Just a drop. -There! -Thank you. So, how are the Countess's French bloomers coming along? I'm not allowed to talk about her undergarments! Come on! Is it a prurient design that's in fashion this year? Some French eroticism in the grand parlours, perhaps? "Good evening, handsome knight. Wouldn't you like to come a bit closer and have a look at my new silk pants?" Have you ever thought about what it's like on the other side of the Atlantic? Oh, yes, I have. Many times. I miss my children. In their latest letter, they said that I should join them. I have actually put away some money in secret, from the sewing. It's for my funeral. But I've been thinking about buying a ticket to America. But I only have enough for one. I can't get it out. You know who should scrub that one clean. Oh, I'd like to see that. Was he very angry? Why would he be angry? I'm the one who should be angry. About the traps! The Baron and his people have cleared the forest. The lanterns kept glowing like wolves' eyes all night. I have to go. You didn't catch anything? What's the matter? Broken. Destroyed. Every single one of them! The whole village has been out clearing the forest of my traps. Not a single person will ever set foot near this cave again. Do you hear me? I'll give them hell, damn it! …so the sinner with the godly. What agreement is there between the hyena and a dog? And what peace between the rich and the poor? As the wild ass is the lion's prey in the wilderness: so the rich eat up the poor. Amen. The unity of this village is of the utmost importance. For the sake of the peace in the village, you need to speak with Lasse. He needs to understand the boundaries that are in place. Otherwise, there will be nothing but fighting and misery. I will try. Good. I really appreciate that you attend services. You know… I am seriously worried about Lasse. His conflict with the Baron will only get worse. Does he know what they did to the traps? The whole village is talking about it. Lasse doesn't know who destroyed them. He suspects everyone, and I haven't said a word. I will not say anything either. Who knows how he would seek revenge? And if he should seek revenge, he will only make it worse for himself. Just between ourselves, the traps are only the beginning. The Baron is as stubborn as they come. He will never give in. He will not stop until Lasse is gone from the cave and the forest. That's just how it is. Look, here's Grandpa, cleaning his gun. Stop, in the name of the law! We're here to confiscate your rifle. What's he doing here? Lars Eriksson… As the local sheriff, it is my duty to take care of that weapon. No one gets to take Lasse's rifle! Calm down, Lasse. I'm just gonna grab the gun, that's all. No one needs to get hurt. Go away. Go back inside! Retreat! Everyone, step back, and lower your guns. -We're supposed to take his gun! -She's only a little girl! We can't hurt her. You idiot! Please, come to your senses, Lasse. This is hardly the place for a little girl. You want some? That's raw. Don't eat that. Go out and play, so I can speak to Grandpa. I do apologize for the intervention, and that we were unable to execute it. Are you all natural-born imbeciles?! Five armed men who can't even handle an old man and a little girl! -Lord Baron, the girl-- -No more excuses, please! You are deserters. My housemaid has bigger balls than you do! -Lord Baron, please… -Quiet! I demand results. -Is that clear? -Yes. -What? -Yes! Away with you. I don't want to see you. Be gone! You need to stop poaching. The whole village is against us. I know that! Every Sunday in church, people shoot me mean looks. I hear them speak ill of us. I need to hunt. Think about the girl! -That's exactly what I'm doing. -She's just like me. -She stands up for herself! -She is nothing like you. She is studious and good in school. You can neither read nor write. -Never mention that again! -I will never say a word about it. I hope everything is to your liking. They are very beautiful. Just like I imagined. The money for your trouble is on the table. I wrote it down as work-clothes, just like we agreed. I was thinking about inviting your husband to the hunt. I would strongly advise you not to do so. Lasse is the most skilled hunter in all of western Sweden. He needs to part take. Lasse is a man with a capricious temper. It can end very badly. Enough! If I were in your position and got such a grand invitation, I would have been extremely pleased. And don't you worry. I will make sure Lasse gets a seat at the table. Someone needs to put an end to all this shooting! Calm down, My Lord. Think about your blood pressure! You've been gone long. -Did you get anything to eat? -Yes. We caught some fish. Oh, fish? Some fish, yes, but no game. Tonight, Lasse will set new traps. Do you want to come with me? Don't drag the girl into your illegal business. Just don't, Lasse. Fine, I won't. Lasse will handle the traps himself. Fetch me some rope and a lantern! What does this say here? Inga! What name does it say? Hey! What does it say? Inga! It's the Baron's lantern. It belongs to his men. What will you do now? I will show the Baron what a trap looks like! Have I ever told you how to dig a proper hog pit? No? -You're staying here. -Let go! URGENT FOR THE BARON Good morning! Good morning. It looks delicious! What is this carelessness? You know that I want to be served two hard-boiled eggs in the morning, peeled and surrounded by a thin layer of salt. -Where's the sugar? -The sugar is in the coffee. Only one egg, the salt forgotten, and the sugar hidden in the coffee. The next time I want to be served a camouflaged breakfast, I'll ask for it. I found it lying under a stone on the steps. Oh, my! Nordensson has some new information about Lasse's trap. He wants to meet me now, at dawn, by the oak in the old field. Why am I telling you all this? His handwriting is as poor as that of a doctor. Even a child has better penmanship! What a nobody! Are you really going to the old field? Why, of course! Have my carriage brought around. -The carriage is being repaired. -What on earth-- I need to leave now! This might be crucial evidence. Hurry! Put on your hunting coat! Don't just stand there like a ninny. I need a hat! Hello? Hello? Wake up, he's coming! Nordensson? Hello? Are you here? Nordensson? Damn! Hello? Nordensson! Hello! Can anyone hear me? Help! I can't get out! We have to help him! Help! Help me! Oh, thank God! You see… You have to help me get out of here. Would you give me your hand? And pull! There! Lasse! What have you done?! Don't you get that I've been worried about the girl? We caught a hog. -But you're empty-handed. -The hog got away. Just look at you! You have to be clean for church. Go wash up. Hurry! You don't think I know that you did something to the Baron? How can you put the girl in danger like that? She's become just like you. You are like two feral animals. Eventually, they helped the Baron out of the pit. -Surely, Lasse dug that pit to begin with. -Lasse had the girl with him, too. It's inappropriate to drag the girl along to something like that. And here is our heroine. We've heard all about it. Well done! The Baron's maid just told us she saw you and Lasse save the Baron. Good thing they found him. Apparently, he'd fallen into a deep pit and couldn't get out. The Baron's maid said he was squealing like a pig. She saw it all. I'm so thankful you saved the Baron. He's one of my best customers. Here's a cone of candy as a thank you. You will look at the possibilities of summoning military reinforcements. Lasse needs to go, even if it requires violence. Military reinforcements? You don't think that's a bit drastic? If our law enforcement officer is unable to stop one single poacher in the woods, what do you think will happen when that kind of lawlessness spreads? Very well. I will see what I can do about it. Lasse will be justly punished. Can I get a thimbleful, too? Ah! The Countess. What a surprise! Here you go. Cheers! How refreshing! Please… You look a bit poorly. How's your health? Well… It's exceptional. However, I'm slightly confused as to why Lasse is still poaching on my land. And now in the company of a young girl. But we're taking care of things now, once and for all. It is our duty as authorities to that laws and regulations are followed. We will investigate if the military can be of assistance in the matter. Absolutely not! I came here to talk about the annual deer hunt. We cannot risk a big scandal or indeed a possible massacre. What if an innocent child is shot dead! You are correct about our responsibilities regarding laws and regulations. We are in full agreement on this. I know you wish to seek justice, but please, wait until after the hunt. For my sake! I promise to help you deal with Lasse. You know I have a close relationship with the landowner on whose land the cave is located. One conversation with Farmer Pettersson, and Lasse will move back to the village. Good! I'm very satisfied with your assurance. Perfect! Stay attentive in school. That's important. -I will. -Great. Here. Very well. Drive! Give our regards to your mother! I'm fond of you, you know that, but I want to go to America. And if try to you stop me, I'll run away. -Welcome. -It's raining! Put the kettle on! I have a letter for you, Lasse. Probably just rubbish. -Will you read? -Give it here. I'll read it. So… It's from the Countess. She's inviting you to the annual deer hunt. Yes, indeed! It's been signed and sealed by the Countess. I recognize her handwriting. Here you go. It also says you can bring a hunting companion. -Cheers! -Cheers. Duty calls. I have to get on, come wind or rain. You're always welcome here! Now's your chance! Make peace with the Baron. Promise us all that you will stop hunting on his land. Lasse doesn't give in to anyone! Lasse hunts how he wants, where he wants, and when he wants. You did what?! It will be interesting to go hunting with a genuine hunter of the old school. He's a criminal who should be put behind bars! You gave me your word that you would help me remove Lasse from this region. True, I gave you my word. I also promised my guests an event out of the ordinary. Which it will be, when Lasse shows up. You know what I think about Lasse. I beg of you… reassess your decision. He is widely regarded as the best hunter in the area. That is just mad nonsense. He's an anarchist, for crying out loud! I've already sent him the invitation. -Lasse doesn't belong among us. -That's exactly the point! -Engineer Lindgren and company. -Everything is in order. -Welcome. -Thank you. Go to the kitchen entrance, and they will help you. We are here to take part in the hunt on the estate. -Oh, really? Your name, please? -Postmaster Lagergren. -There you are. And your name? -Lasse. It probably says Lars Eriksson. There it is. Everything is in order. Welcome! Does it say anything interesting? Nothing but war and misery. I find wars quite interesting! Why don't you read the article out loud to us? If only I can find it. -Don't tell me you can't read. -Of course I can! Too bad there aren't more pictures to look at, like a child reads the paper. Speaking of children… Glad to hear you've found someone on your own level to socialize with. But don't you find it a tad odd that an old man like you and a young innocent girl go out into the forest together? What do you get up to out there? Huh? All alone. -Late at night. -What are you implying?! It's time to get started now. Welcome to the hunt! I just have one tiny question. You did speak with Pettersson, didn't you? I have spoken with Landowner Pettersson, and he will have Lasse ejected, when I ask him. After the hunt, Lasse and his wife will move into the village, and you're free to summon as many soldiers as you wish. I'm looking forward to law and order prevailing in these parts once more. -What are they doing over there? -Lasse seems to have spotted something. Nah… This all looks pretty uncertain to me. Don't you agree? Don't worry. I'll bring one down, all right. We might as well head back. We've been to our two best sites, and we haven't even sighted a single deer. Show some perseverance! Remember, the nobility is supposed to lead and inspire. I apologize for my querulous attitude. You are obviously right. -Not what I'd call "happy hunting." -My thoughts exactly. Sometimes, it's hard to live up to your reputation. Congratulations! That was very skilful and quite impressing. You really are as brilliant as everyone says. He couldn't escape Lasse. Oh, no! Later on, I'll show you some of my own hits in the trophy room. Do you happen to have a cigar to offer? I'm out. Thank you. Here you are. That specimen was difficult to bring down. It took me three shots. That's the gun I used in Africa. It was crafted by a famous gunsmith in England. Perfectly balanced. Feel it! Magnificent craftsmanship. It fits perfectly in the hand. A very beautiful weapon. You truly live for the hunt. It shows in your eyes. My husband tells me I've got that look, the hunter's gaze. In the woods, Lasse is free. Is that why you moved to the cave, to feel free? Free from people. And no one would house us. So, you moved to the cave because no one wanted you as lodgers? No one! If it weren't for the cave, we would have had to move on. -Away from the region? -Far away. Do you recognize it, the skilful work? Your wife made this one. And many more, over the years. You didn't seriously think that wicker baskets and handsewn aprons paid for your coffee and liquor? I realize this comes as a surprise to you, as your wife has been very discrete, as per my instructions, of course. You really ought to appreciate your wife more. Well… It's doesn't matter now. That time is over. What do you mean, Lasse? Inga is going to run off to America. She's not happy with the cave. I know that times are bleak, and that you're having a hard time in the cave. I think it's time to speak plainly. Lasse, I need you both. I want you to make my events into adventures, and I want your wife to continue to sew for me. So, if you want to keep your wildlife dream alive, you take this sewing machine with you and give it to Inga. But I require that you be there for me whenever I ask you to. Do we have an agreement? I never really thought that… But are you sure? America is so far away. I'm absolutely sure. It's going to be so empty here. Promise me you'll write. -You wanted to speak with me. -Please be seated, Lord Baron. Your wish is my command, my dear. So, what did you want to talk to me about? I have come to the realization that I need both Lasse and Inga. I have therefore withdrawn my decision to assist you in this matter. So much for a woman's word. -You really are a damned-- -I advise you not to finish that sentence. You shrew! You might be able to grab your husband by the neck like a puppy, but you will never be able to subdue me. Lasse is going to leave that cave. Excuse me. The Baron would like to exchange a few words with you, in private. This way. Oh! You displayed great hunting skills today, Lasse. It amused me to see that you don't always engage in poaching. But I'm having trouble wrapping my head around something. Maybe you can help me? I received a strange letter a while back, that led me down into a pit. No, no. I'm not accusing you of anything. You can neither read nor write, isn't that so? I know you didn't write this letter. From what I hear, your granddaughter is a diligent student. And the girl was close by the pit when the incident occurred. And what's more, the handwriting does resemble that of a child. She had nothing to do with it! I understand it can be hard to hear. But I do in fact suspect that the little girl wrote this letter. It would be extremely regrettable if I had to take further action. An inquiry would easily determine if it is, in fact, the girl's handwriting. Signing it as Sheriff Nordensson… and impersonating a law enforcement officer… These are very serious allegations. She could be thrown out of school and put in an orphanage because of this. And from there on, we both know the road will lead straight to the gutter. Leave her out of this! You're the one who chose to drag her into this. As a Baron, I try to be a good and fair man. The girl is just a child. I might agree on avoiding a legal process. But it will cost you. I suggest that we barter. You can have the letter. And I get your gun in exchange. And you have to move out of the cave. You have two weeks to leave. And if you do, you can have the letter back. Huh? -People have started to enter now. -Excellent! Let's go and eat. Don't look so disheartened, Lasse. The poorhouse is nothing to be ashamed of. It's really not as crowded as one might think. Now then, gentlemen! In just a moment, you'll be welcomed into the dining room. I hope the food is to your liking. And there's no need to worry. My husband did not prepare the food. Lasse! So, this is where you are. The dinner has started. I'm not hungry. I saw the Baron. He was carrying your gun. Lasse had to give it away. Why in heaven's name did you have to give your gun away? That damned Baron has a letter that the girl wrote to lure him into the pit. He will ruin the girl's life if we don't leave the cave. That knave! We'll find a solution, Lasse. Let's head inside and eat. Come on! This should be interesting. That they get to attend the hunt is one thing, but I don't understand why they have to be seated at the table. I didn't travel 200 kilometres to dine with the bottom layer of society. Bon appétit! Enjoy. Do you always eat your meat that way? No. Sometimes, Lasse eats with his hands. I was referring to the fact that your meat hasn't been cooked. He has the taste buds of a hunter. Isn't that right, Lasse? Yes. The taste of death, game, rawness, and blood, that's what I like. I have to congratulate the hostess on the well-planned seating arrangement. Thank you. I pray you'll excuse the mishap earlier. That our footman found your place card out with the servants. That was a misunderstanding. My instructions were very clear. You were supposed to be seated with people of similar nobility. No matter. I'm a sympathetic man. My maid can't even set a breakfast tray properly. I can't for the life of me understand why women always fumble the easiest of tasks. What do you say, gentlemen? Keep your chin up! You do tolerate a bit of friendly banter, don't you? Lasse, seeing that you're such a skilled hunter… I have some trouble with hogs on my land. Rumour has it, you're a skilled trap maker. Particularly pits. Is that maybe something you could advise me on? Yes, I know how a pit should be dug, all right. Deep enough, and covered with twigs. That's excellent, Lasse! You actually get to do something useful with your hands. To sit in a study and read is not for you. Or writing letters. You're my kind of hunter, Lasse. A strong individualist. You're willing to sacrifice everything in your life for the sake of the hunt. Truly, a man of action. Indeed! Lasse doesn't have to fawn to get what he wants. And speaking of hunting… I hear the Countess has been to Africa, hunting on the savanna. Yes, I was able to bring down the occasional rhino, but actually, I was there to assist people in need. And speaking of those in need, I recently took a trip to Stockholm. I took the opportunity to visit an orphanage. It was amazing to see how grateful they were for a basket of food or some blankets. But it was heart-wrenching to see these poor little children, suffering and starving, without any parents. Young girls, so thin that there was nothing left but skin and bones. Whatever will become of them? I hope you took the opportunity to eat your fill. Without a gun, you won't be seeing any meat for a while. What happened to your gun? Oh, didn't you hear? Lasse has been incredibly generous. He offered me his rifle as a memento of this hunt. Now, that's what I call class! An act of a true gentleman. A skilled hunter like you, Lasse, deserves a proper gun. And so, I'd like to hand over this beautiful weapon to you. Please. Don't say a word. You need this gun considerably more than I do. You will regret this. Mark my words! You have nothing but a fancy title and inherited money. I pity your listless husband, but if you were my wife, I, too, would drink myself to sleep. Women like you make me sick. Oh! Is the wild man going to protect her? Go on then, Lasse. Hit me! Hit me! You'll still lose everything anyway. I'm going to revel in seeing you crawl to the poorhouse, pitiful and defeated. Dear members of the hunting society! Before we wrap up this event, I have some news to share. May I ask Lasse and the Baron to step forward? Lasse, watching you hunt reminds me of a time when the hunt was an adventure. I have therefore, as chairman of the society, today appointed you, Lars Eriksson, our permanent guest of honour. As you all know, according to Article 5 of our bylaws, poaching is illegal. But since Lasse has no land of his own, the Baron has been kind enough to, as a thank you for this handmade rifle, grant Lasse full hunting rights on his own land. Lord Baron! Right! Lars Eriksson. You are… …always welcome to hunt on my land. Don't forget, I still have that letter in my pocket. Two weeks, or you will never see that girl again. I will ruin her life. You'll never encounter any more issues with the Baron. He still has the letter. I can't risk the girl's life. You won't have to anymore. What do you mean? Postmaster Lagergren at your service. Toodle-oo! I thought… I thought you were gone. I was gone. You mean you've come back? Inga. Inga. Will you stay with me? It's yours. The Baron was going to ruin the young girl's life. I was prepared to move. -You would move for the girl's sake? -Yes. There won't be any more fighting with the Baron now. Inga. Inga. I'm willing to move for your sake, too. -But you don't want to? -No. Lasse! The work-clothes you brought in last week are in high demand in the village. Maybe you'd like to make more of them. Oh! Who knew people in Lidköping were so fond of work-clothes. Inga, it's a joy to see your steps getting lighter and lighter here in church. It's also a great relief that you managed to make your husband come around. For a while there, I thought he was losing his humanity. Turns out, he is quite civilized. -How's life in the cave now? -Life is a lot calmer now. And this summer, Gerda will come and stay with us again. I hope to see more of you and the little girl this summer. And you know, Lasse is always welcome in church, too. If he behaves. But it might ruin his reputation as a caveman. What with all the stories going around, he sure has a lot to live up to. You wouldn't believe all the tall tales I get to hear. But as I understand it, many of them come out of his own mouth. Lasse is actually not that aggressive towards people anymore. When we have guests, he'll gladly talk about everything he's been through. As long as they bring liquor, of course. So… What happened next, Lasse? So, there Lasse was, by the gate, outside the castle. In full armour, that glimmered in the moonlight. And the King opened his window and showed his royal visage. Because he wanted to make sure… -What was that? -He wanted to make sure -Oh! -that Lasse was on site. Because he was unable to go to sleep if he hadn't made sure that Lasse was guarding the gate. Yeah… He couldn't… But how was the King able to see you if it was dark? Goddamn it! Subtitle translation by: Lovisa Håkansdotter Wallin
