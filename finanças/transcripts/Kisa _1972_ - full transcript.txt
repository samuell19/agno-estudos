Mr. Lutkin, producer and actor. He gladly chats with me, mom. That is, he talks and I listen. That's how I got the text. Costumes? What's up with the costumes over there? That's it. Each their own costume. Adjust your seats. We're rehearsing, just carry on with your job. The whole line, there like that. Children... Go down there. Come on. Good. There. What's with all twrling, go. Boy, music! Quickly! Ladies and gentlemen, traveling theater "Moon and Stars" is theater under the open sky, as were the theaters in Ancient Greece. If only you knew mom, life of a producer is so interesting. Like the old one, my theater called "Moon and Stars" will also show you a piece with lots of love, lots of hate, lots of murders, and only when it's needed, with nice music. As you know, nice music, when a bit louder, signifies a kiss, or death. My theater, as you can see, is open to all. What I'm asking from you is clapping, and from God nice weather. If it rains, show won't go on. Your money, in case of raining... There! At ticket booth. There are no illusions, no cheating. My name is Lutkin. It's written on programme one can buy. Lutkin has for you, ladies and gentlemen, comrades, adapted Chekhov. The piece is called RAIN And from her he found out she grew up in Petersburgand married in S. where she's been living for 2 years. That she'll spend a month in Yalta, and that her husband will come for her who also wants to take a rest. Thank you. She could never explain where her husband had a post, in a Crown Department or under the Provincial Council and was amused by her own ignorance. And Gurov learnt, too, that she was called Anna Sergeyevna. Afterwards he thought about her in his room, thought she would certainly meet him next day it would be sure to happen. This must have been the first time in her life she had been alone in surroundings in which she was followed, looked at, and spoken to merely from a secret motive which she could hardly fail to guess. He recalled her slender, delicate neck, her lovely grey eyes. "There's something pathetic about her, anyway," he thought, and fell asleep. Not bad. Looking for something? You lost something, sir? Pardon, you said something? Yes. I asked if you lost something. I didn't lose anything. I thought you... I apologize, I thought you looked for something. Yes, that is true. I acted as if I... You acted as if you looked? I was looking for your dog. My dog? But I don't have one. That's exactly the point. Excuse me? Don't you know that a dog is great connection between two strangers? All beautiful women should have a dog. Imagine for a moment you sitting there completely ignorant of me but your dog heard me coming, and comes asking for sugar. I'm horrified by the sight of people giving them sugar. That's begining of slavery. Beg, act out I listened and I'm not giving sugar. There's no sugar, your mistress doesn't allow. Don't act out please, go! Go! You scared him. And me as well, with your deep voice. - It's true... Look how sad he goes back to you. I easily laugh, I apologize. I forgive you. A bit explosive laugh. That's how we met. - I talked to you first. Yes, but I had to act out. It's all so simple. Only thanks to you. Listen, lady, will let me talk to you? You see, it sounds artificial above all. And if we supposed you said "Of course dear sir" what would I say? I'll be very short. I'd try to be funny and interesting, in vain of course. And a little comedy releaves of inhibition. And when we notice we're talking we already said a lot. That's true. Have you been here for long time? Five days ago. I've been here for two weeks. Time goes by very fast, but it's so boring here. It's just a custom to say 'It's so boring here'. Someone lives in Kladovo without being bored. And comes here in a wordly place and starts talking it's boring, it's cold. One would think they came from Paris. Good day. Excuse me? Excuse me? I didn't say anything. Coffee, please. I thought you said you were bored. It is. I'm alone. We've been waiting for vacation for so long. Your dog saved us. If you had a dog, that is, somebody else could sit with you. You're stepping over the line. I apologize. I didn't say that to you. Thank you. You're right. I wanted to say I'm very pleased to talk to you. Because you smiled. Did you smile? You did. I smile easily. But I don't have many opportunities. Are you married? He doesn't smile. It seems that women always remember men who made them smile. Are there many women who remember you? How to say... It seems you're very skillful in these little comedies for making contact. I have to admit that I am, though I'm shy in essence. Don't judge too severly. You entertained me nicely. And now you think about how to leave. I don't know. I'm not funny anymore. Good bye. Good bye. You forgot something. Who? You? You forgot Medor. Medor? Yes, Medor. Your dog. Your ferry's arrived. Travellers are getting out. Nice ferry. General. - Where? Where? There. He limps. Certainly some old wound. Perhaps... lumbago. You're naughty. I'm merciless towards generals. Why them? Because of horses. What d' you think, I've read on some monument to a general 9 marches, 36 battles, 12 wounds, 16 horses killed under him. How many horses? I really love docks. But I hate train stops a bit more. When you're arriving or leaving? Leaving, of course. I get sick when I think about returning. Why? Ferry left. It's a bit chilly. You're not cold? I don't know. Perhaps we could take a boat. There's a restaurant and Greek music near our hotel. I don't know. Choose what you want. I don't know how to choose. What are you waiting for? I don't know. Lets go to my place. You don't respect me. Why would I stop respecting you? You don't know what you're saying. Let the God forgive me. It's horrible. You seem to be justifying yourself. How can I justify myself? I haven't cheated on my husband, but myself. And not only now. I've been cheating him for long time. My husband is perhaps honorable, good man, but he's lackey. I don't know what he's doing, how he serves, I just know he's a lackey. When I married him, I was 20 years old. I was tortured by curiosity. I wanted something better. There is, I said to myself, a different life. I wanted to live, to survive, to be alive. Curiosity burned me. You don't understand. But I swear to God, I couldn't hold myself anymore. Something was happening to me, I could stay at home anymore. I said to my husband I'm ill, and came here. But here, I walked here as on embers, as crazy, and now I became what I am, a woman everyone can despise. Believe me, please believe me. I love honorable, clean life. I'm disgusted by the sin. In our province they say the unholy one seduced her. I can say for myself now that the unholy one seduced me. I don't undestand what you want. Chipi, come, Chipi! Come, jump. Come, Chipily. Come Chipi. Here you are. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's good I'm leaving. Destiny wants it. Echo of a leaving train will disappear in a minute. This man will continue with his vacation in two minutes. Every day a man on train stop, in winter or summer, leaves or stays. He now thinks how his life is richer for an experience, and adventure, he now thinks how all of that is only a memory. But he feels a tinge of remorse. That young woman he'll never see again, wasn't happy with him. When you water the flowers, it smells better, when the heart falls in love, the man breaths better. A drink for friendship, and love eternal, for the times past, and timeless future. A drink for friendship, and love eternal, for the times past, and timeless future. As is the grass, drinking rain drops, so is the human heart, yearning for love. A drink for friendship, and love eternal, for the times past, and timeless future. Good evening. I'm back. How did the vacation go? How are the children? - Good. Good. They are asleep. Did you get my postcard? Come on in, did we get your postcard... Come in. You got in time not to forget you. And to pay the rent. And to advise me. A wrote a piece during your absence. Sit. - I should unpack, wash up... - Nah, sit, just half an hour, sit. The stage shows village street. Hospital to the right, school to the left. Villagers sit on hospital stairs. How many acts? - Five. Valentin looks through school window. In the back of the stage, villagers move things into the tavern. Valentin 'Please let me leave.' Ana, scared 'Why?' Valenting, for himself, 'She turned pale.' To her 'Don't make me explain. I'd rather die before you find out the reason.' Ana, after a pause 'You can't leave.' Valentin hold Ana in arms 'You've resurected me.' 'You've showed me meaning of life.' 'You've made me born again as spring rains enlivens the awaken soil.' 'But... Too late.' 'My chest destroys incurable illness.' Enters the baron, police scribe, with policemen. Valentin 'Take me!' Ana 'I'm not letting him, take me too, yes, me too!' 'I love him. Yes, I love him more than my life!' Baron 'Ana Sergeyevna, you forget you're killing your father.' How is it? Horrible. I didn't know what to do. You've stayed long on your vacation. I almost rented your room. Why didn't you? Children got used to you. How are they studying? Without you... badly. May I see them? Of course! Good evening. Hello. - Good evening. How are you? Great. What did you bring to us? I brought you... music. Nice? Thank you. If only you knew what a wonderful woman I met at Bled. Mister Lutkin, you were right yesterday. Fish wasn't fresh. How did vacaction go? Fine. Good. What did the landlady say? - Almost eviction. Keep that granny. Drive faster. Good day. You're the driver? - Yes. Who drew the other one? - I did. Are there any injured? - No. Just a moment to take photos. Ciro, get the meter to measure street and tracks. Width? Your driving licence please. Here you are. - How long have you've been driving? - 5 years. Do you drink? - No. I don't want to take to the bar, did you drink before this? - No. You went too far to the left, you seem to love the left side. We'll see. Good day. - Good day. Please, whose picture is in the window? Excuse me? - This picture in the window. My wife. Painting amateur. Beautiful thing, isn't it? Beautiful thing. Bye until the next accident. When Lutkin saw her his heart contracted, and he understood clearly that for him there was in the whole world no creature so near, so precious, and so important to him. She, this little woman, in no way remarkable, lost in a provincial crowd, illed his whole life now, was his sorrow and his joy, the one happiness that he now desired for himself. How you have frightened me! Oh, how you have frightened me! I am half dead. Why have you come? Why? But do understand. - I am so unhappy, I have thought of nothing but you all the time. I live only in the thought of you. And I wanted to forget, to forget you, but why, oh, why, have you come? What are you doing, what are you doing! We are mad. Go away today, go away at once.... I beseech you... There are people coming this way! You must go away. Do you hear, I will come and see you. I have never been happy; I am miserable now, and I never, never shall be happy, never! I swear I'll come to you. But now let us part. My precious, dear one, we must part! She pressed his hand and began rapidly going downstairs, looking round at him, and from her eyes he could see that she really was unhappy. He stood for a little while, and left slowly. But why there are no thunders in winter? - There are no thunders in winter because ask the teacher. - Will come earler home tonight? I will. Good bye. - Bye! I thought everything will get better if I just saw you. Coming here and knowing I have to leave, is taking the toll. I can't take it anymore. Why? Why do we have to hide? Why does she love me so? I'm afraid she doesn't love me, but a man created by her imagination. I don't know why women love me. When they noticed their mistake, they loved me all the same. And not one of them had been happy with me. Time passed, I had made their acquaintance, got on with them, parted, but I had never once loved. It was anything you like, but not love. And only now when I started career, I fell in love, properly, truly, for the first time in my life. Do you want something? Lutkin and Angela loved each other like people very close and akin, like husband and wife, like tender friends. It seemed to them that fate itself had meant them for one another, and they could not understand why he had a wife and she a husband. It was as though they were a pair of birds of passage, caught and forced to live in different cages. They forgave each other for what they were ashamed of in their past, they forgave everything in the present, and felt that this love of theirs had changed them both. Lets think of some plan now. Or I'll think of it until you come again. To stay? How? To hide? Where? To try to not see each other? How can I? Yes.. How? Yes, yes... How? And it seemed as though in a little while the solution would be found, and then a new and splendid life would begin. and it was clear to both of them that they had still a road before them, and that the most complicated and difficult part of it was only just beginning. Greta Garbo! That is Angela! I'll earn money on her. I'm all in tears. Life of a producer is so interesting, mother. It's so full of unforseen things. For example, You rent a summer theater for a season, find actors, discuss roles, scenography, effects, music, ads and posters are printed, and all of that costs a lot, mum. You enlist policemen, staff for seeing the public in and out, And then mum, it starts to rain. Rain. It's been raining for 15 days without a stop. Of course, the play can go on. But those who bought the tickets, want to the money back. And staff and actors want their pay. Everything's exciting, so alive, interesting. Producer Lutkin's pulling his hair out. Curses the rain, curses his vocation. But I feel his essentially happy. And that all these torments are his life. He is... his voice is warm, long dark hair falls down his neck. I love him, mum. Yes, yes. Yes. My Lutkin has run away. I've just know understood his words, 'Wait for me.' Waiting for what? But I had to see it coming, mum, when that damned rain started.
