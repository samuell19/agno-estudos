You are a successful American businessman with an impressive career in your field in the US. Weren't you worried that an investment in a Czech film might put you at risk? Doing business in the Czech Republic sometimes has that effect. Many people run into problems here. After my return I gave it a lot of thought, I was telling myself that I have no idea what I'm getting into, wondering if I might have to eventually sell some planes or cars, or my race-cars, or the condominium in Florida, or the house and ships. And then I thought that Adolf could not be this demanding and that the money would not just evaporate, just like everything else does. And when we finally agreed on a certain amount with Adolf, I was really relieved, because it was simple as that, and when we shook hands on it, I was absolutely sure that Adolf would keep to the budget. And he really did. So I was really glad that I didn't have to sell any of my toys nor give up my hobbies in the end. Does it mean that you were actually surprised by the final amount you invested in the film? Firstly, I was extremely surprised by the amount alone, secondly, I was surprised that the film kept its word and stuck to the budget on a very good level. There was a time though, when a new catering assistant joined the team and she got herself started, she kept buying chorizo instead of the cheaper bologna, so we exceeded the budget by a couple of thousand, but Adolf quickly put an end to it and returned to saving, as he did from day one. For most of the filming and the post-production you were in the US. When did you first see the film? I watched the first decent copy. The form was there, but it was longer, the sound wasn't perfect, the colors were different from what they are now. I watched it on a boat in Italy, where I met with Adolf and his wife. It was great even in this rough version, and I knew at once that it would be a great success and that it would be an amazing documentary. Even though I liked it the way it was, Adolf kept on insisting that it still could be better. So that's when I watched the film for the first time and I enjoyed it a lot then. You met with Jan Saudek a few times during the filming. What was he like? He was very nice. I wasn't sure what to expect of him. I didn't know much about him, about his riots here, about all his usual pranks. I only came to know him really well in person and he made quite an interesting impression on me, it was nice talking to him and I think we instantly took to each other because I live in America and he visited America and likes the country very much. He even wrote me a very nice letter, which I have as a keepsake, with a beautiful hand-painted envelope. I think our next meeting with Jan will be wonderful and I am really looking forward to it.
