My master was Mr. Maeda. I've been training under him for 8 years. Suddenly, one day, he cooked me a bowl of hot noodles. After I finished, he asked me to return home to promote his way of cooking A bowl of hot noodles again... When I was in Tokyo, I ate at a noodle stall in the red light district. I met a couple. They were very sweet. They looked just ordinary. But I noticed that under the table... they were holding hands and they never let go of each other. They looked at each other with such fondness. When the noodles arrived, the chef set the bowl down. The boy prepared a pair of chopsticks for the girl. He even fed her. I was really touched. Because I felt that even though they shared a single bowl, they were really happy. That is love. Very simple. Yes, it should be simple.

Yes, do the honor At last, I have my own AC! It really works! And it's pink too! Stopped? It stopped. So cool... I didn't see the ad. Then why did you come? Because Wasabi and Soy Sauce are meant to be together. Today is the 100th day, go take a look! What's wrong? He didn't come. Where is Xiao Fang? How come he's not here? He's gone. He said he wanted to see the outside world. He's gone? He just left for the train station. It's the last day. Why don't you continue? Who am I? You think that I deserve her? I'll go out into the world... and make some good money. She'll be married by then. Then I'll win her back. Silly boy! Take it. I lost. Not yet! Shanghai, economy class. Xiao Fang Xiao Fang Xiao Fang!

I can hear the music you play, it's...Mozart. Honey, I've made up with our son. Wai, holding you I can feel your heart. Thank you. Meeting you is the best thing that ever happened in my life.

Sure! It's 6 in the morning already. Your watch is really cool. My dad gave it to me. 20 years ago, my dad made a bet with his boss. He had to stand outside under the blazing sun. For 100 days! My dad told me. Those 100 days represented persistence and hope. Xiao Fang, you came back to me!
