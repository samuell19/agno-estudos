Michelle wants the changes to the docket. Can you send them before you leave for the weekend? - I already did. - [Greg On Phone] Yeah, no, I got those. But we have new language. - No, I mean I already left the office. - [Greg On Phone] What? - I'm getting on a ferry. - [Greg On Phone] You know it's only two o'clock, right? - [Man] I gotta go, I'll see you Tuesday. - [Greg On Phone] But what about...

Call me back when you get... Listen, I took care of the docket but I'd appreciate it if you keep me in the loop when you have outside commitments. - Piece of shit. - Excuse me? - Oh, no, nothing. - Do you need anything else? - Just the check, please. - [Michelle Voiceover] Hi Joseph, it's Michelle. I spoke with Greg. I went ahead and set up a feedback session for next week with me and HR, okay? See you Tuesday. - Boyfriend? - Work. - That's too bad. Where do you work? - At a law firm. - I'm gonna guess. Receptionist? - Lawyer. - Wow.

We're headed to a drag show. (chuckling) - Work on your lies, little lawyer. And friendly tip, no one goes to the Meat Rack anymore. - What? - I saw you Googling.

I'll mail it to you tomorrow. - Okay, thanks. - [Woman On Phone] Are you at work? - I'm actually outside. I needed some fresh air. - [Woman On Phone] Oh, good for you, honey. Well, exciting as ever here. I'm doing a thrilling load of laundry. Doing anything fun for the holiday weekend? - Not really. - [Woman On Phone] No dates or anything like that? - Mom. - [Mom On Phone] Hey, just asking. A mom can ask. You know who I was thinking about recently was that friend of yours from school. Ran into his mom at parent's weekend. - Johnathon? - [Mom On Phone] Yeah, Johnathon, that's it. I think he works in finance or something because he's always posting news articles about this company he sold to some bank. First Bank. I don't know, maybe it's all Russian bots. Who can tall what's real these days? Well, anyway, he lives in New York, doesn't he? - Yeah. - [Mom On Phone] Well. - Mom, Johnathon's straight. - [Mom On Phone] Really? Gosh, he seems so soft to me. Maybe he knows people. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to imply you don't know people. - It's fine. - [Mom On Phone] You know, I was just reading an article about how some of the smartest people are introverts. - Mom. - [Mom On Phone] Oh honey, I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to work. Everything there okay? - It's... I'm actually thinking about leaving. Doing something more meaningful with my life with defense or something, I don't know. Feel like I haven't found my place yet, you know? (alarm buzzing) Are you there? - [Mom On Phone] Baby, I'm so sorry, the dyer beeped. Can you say that again? - Nothing, I gotta go, I'll talk to you later. - [Mom On Phone] Are you sure? - Yeah, I love you, bye. (dramatic music) - Hey. - Hi. - [Man] What's your name? - Joseph. - Just Joseph? Not Joey or... - Jo-Jo? - No. (chuckling) (laughing) - Okay. How long are you here? - I don't know. I might be leaving soon. I'm not having as much fun as I thought I would. - This your first time? Who're you here with? Well no fucking wonder, buddy! You're here by yourself at the off-season? Ugh, talk about thirsty. - Shut up. (laughing) - Do you want to? Show me how thirsty you are. (laughing) Have you been to the Meat Rack yet?

You were out for awhile there. You... You allergic to asprin? There you go. (groaning) (eerie music) - [Man] Help! - Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I gotta go. - You're okay. - I gotta go. - You're fine. You're fine. Hey, hey, it's all right. (crying) Okay, all right. Just... Take a breath, okay? (crying) (somber music) - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. (muffled speaking) (crickets chirping) - [Cameron] What'd they say? - Just to go to a branch when I get back. - How's the headache? - You a doctor or something? - Took a first aid course once. Is there anyone else you wanna call? - Not really. Anyways, I probably wouldn't even know their numbers. They're all in my phone. Thanks for letting me borrow yours, by the way. - No problem. Do you remember anything else? - I... I'm just really tired. - Well, you're welcome to stay here for now. Spare room you can crash in. - Thanks. - No problem. Just let me know what you need. - Thank you for everything. - Oh my God, stop saying that, it's not the Oscars. - I'm gonna.

She's Carly Ray. - There he is. How'd you sleep in there? - Oh, fine. Thanks for the clothes. - Oh, Cameron, you are a classy slut. - [Cameron] Jealous. - Joseph, how're you feeling? - Joseph, this is Anabi, he's a physician. That's Shane, he's an asshole. - Funny. - I'd just be happy to take a look at you later if you like. - I'm fine, thank you. I feel fine. - Do you want some breakfast? - [Joseph] Sure. - So you got fucking drugged and mugged. - I'm... - Shane! - Sorry, what, that's crazy. - Yeah. - So, what brings you to Fire Island? - Oh, I've never been. - [Anabi] Weren't missing much. - He's just mad because he can't use apps. - I know how to use them, I just mourn the way things were. - You want it back that way? - [Anabi] I'm just saying, the '70s, okay... - None of us were around in the '70s, so. - Well, I know that, but that's not my point. - What were we missing out on? Like hiding behind the bushes to hook up with some dude? - [Anabi] Hello? - No offense. - See, this is why I can't take you nowhere. - I didn't go to the woods to hook up, for the record. - [Shane] Sure you didn't, sweetie. - Are you in the city? - Yeah. I went to school there. I work at a law firm and I live in Harlem. - I love Harlem. - Gentrification much? - Oh my God, Shane, shut up. - [Shane] What? It's true. - No, no, it's true, it's true. I own it. It's convenient. - Mmmm, he owns that. Come on, woke white boy. You better lock this down or you're gonna be in serious trouble. So, do you have a boyfriend? - Don't mind Shane. He has a dick sucking problem. - [Anabi] He's just a tad desperate. - Says the doctor who offered to give him a free physical. - I'm just doing my part for universal healthcare. - Ew, ew, ew. Okay, back to the question, please. - No, no boyfriend but I really want one. I mean a relationship. That came out weird. - No, that just came out. - Hey, you're one to talk. - So have you ever been to "the cock?" - [Anabi] Oh my God, Shane. When was the last time you had sex? - This is not about me, this is about him. - A year. - Stop it. I'm more game than that. - [Anabi] Two years. - [Shane] Ew. You're insulting me, trash. - That congressman who you met in D.C. - [Shane] I have no idea what they're talking about. - [Anabi] The Republican. - Yep. - [Anabi] Oh my God, you haven't had any sex since the Republican? - [Cameron] Aw, are you masterbating at least? - [Shane] Stop it, climate change is affecting everything. A drought is a drought is a drought, assholes. (Anabi laughing) - So, do you guys rent this place out every year? - Does it look like I can afford this place? - No, this is all Cam and Rafael. - [Anabi] Mmmm, how's he doing, by the way? - What? What happened to Rafael? - Well he and Marcus broke it off. - What? Shut the front door, when?! - I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. - Was it his boyfriend? - [Shane] Fiance! - When did they break up? - Stop. Okay, just stop! (faint beat music) Sorry, I didn't mean to... It's just really stressful right now for him. For both of them. And... He left this morning anyways, so. Whatever. (water sloshing) (ship horn blowing) (beat music) ¶ Don't you forget about me ¶ ¶ You've been with me all along ¶ ¶ Don't you forget about me ¶ ¶ Because I won't forget you ¶ - So, you work in D.C. - Yeah. I professionally analyze things. - That's vague. Do you like it? - [Cameron] I used to. - So why don't you do something else? - I'm sorry. Didn't you say you're a lawyer? - I like being a lawyer. I just wanna be a different kind. - Oh. Well la di da for you. - If you're unhappy you should change things, right? - I didn't say I was unhappy. - But you just said... - I said I didn't like my job but I'm very good at it. That makes me kinda happy. - Huh. So what do you analyze? So shady. (chuckling) - I am not. - Are you military? CIA? No. (laughing) - State Department. But I as sort of in the military. - Really? - Translator. I was stationed in Germany for awhile. - Wow. What do you speak? - Many tongues. - Say something. - What do you want me to say? - Anything. - "Anything." - You're dumb. - You gotta give me the language. - German. - Ugh, boring. (speaking German) "I love to drink mimosas on the weekend." (laughing) - How do I know you're not bullshitting me? - You don't. - Huh. Spanish? (speaking Spanish) I guess that's right. - Oh, you guess? (laughing) - Arabic. (speaking Arabic) - It's from "A Thousand and One Nights." I had to translate the texts once. - My grandparents served. World War II. I could never handle it. - Sure you could. You're out, right? - It's not the same. You know, putting your life on the line. - [Cameron] You are in some places. - You know what I mean. - It's still an act of defiance. And you can't have social change without acts of defiance. Whether they're against a foreign power or tyranny of the moral majority. - Preach. (chuckling) I didn't mean. - Wasn't long ago I couldn't openly serve. - Queens, let's go! We cannot be late to the preseason pool party. You want mimosas? - I'm good. - Joseph? - Am I okay to drink? - Bitch, you don't need his permission! You want mosas, you get mosas! - [Mugger] You looking for something? - No. - Good, because I wasn't offering. I hate people sometimes. Especially here. (sighing) What's your name? Not much of a talker, huh? - Nope. (chuckling) - Look, I just came over to say hi. You don't have to be a dick about it. - Okay, you've said hi. You can go now. - I'll let you get back to drinking your feelings. - You can leave now. (knife clicking) - Give me your shit. - Dude, just go. - I said, give me your shit, fucking loser. (thudding) (gasping) You fuck, you broke my fucking hand! - [Rafael] It's a sprain. I can show you a break if you want, though. (ominous music) (eerie music) (upbeat music) - Hello. - Hey! No semen in the hot tub, you two! Sluts. - Wow, what a great first party of the season. - Yeah. This is why you don't do Fire Island in April. - Hey, I told you about the climate change like 16 times! - I'm sorry, were you talking? - Shut up! - Anyways, anyways, it's newbie's turn. Let's hear it. - Never have I ever kissed a girl before. - Come on. - Boo! - Stop it, you're wasting our time. - People demand something juicier. Well, rules are rules, rules are rules. Drink up, fellas. - [Shane] Hurry up so we can get to the good questions. - [Man] Shots! - Yes! Give me one! Come on, everybody, you have to do one! Oh my God, everyone take one. - Let's go. - To swallowing. To swallowing.

That was you! - That was you! - That was you! - No it wasn't. I would never do that. I'm classy. Watch it, there's no guard rails, so be careful. - Where do we go? Where do we go? - We go this way. Let's go. - I won! (laughing) - What, you think I'm gonna give you a medal or something? - Yeah. - Oh yeah? (moaning) Okay, come one. - Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. Right here. - Oh. - Yeah. You know what, let's just get rid of this. - Okay, easy tiger. - Now who's the prude? (thudding) (ominous music) - It was probably just a deer. They're all over this fucking place. (thudding) Here. I'll show you. Huh. She must be gone. - She? Wouldn't that make her a doe instead of a deer? - What are you? Maria Von Trapp? (giggling) (somber music) (moaning) (huffing) - No, wait. Okay. (moaning) Hey. Do you have condoms and stuff? - Yeah, I have everything. Give me a sec. (thudding) (ominous music) - Hello? (groaning) What the? (thudding) (whimpering) - [Cameron] L?! - I'm sorry, I thought he was breaking in. - Jesus! - [Joseph] I didn't know. - Hand me a towel. - Fucking dead. - All right. All right, keep your head up, keep your head up. Pinch, pinch, pinch. Jeez. Help me get him up. All right. - [Joseph] Watch your step. There's a step, there's a step right there. - Okay. All right. Watch the white pillows. Jesus. L, you gotta hold this to your nose, all right? Hey, do you hear me?! (Rafael groaning) Would you mind getting a bucket? - Yeah. (groaning) - What the fuck is wrong with you? (ominous music) Hey. - Sorry. - Help me flip him on three. One. Two. Three. Okay. There's a bucket next to you, okay? Okay? - [Rafael] Yeah. (sighing) - I'm so sorry. - This is not your fault. He was supposed to go home on the ferry today. - Why didn't he? - I don't... Listen, I'm just gonna stay here for awhile, make sure he's okay. - Yeah, sure. (sighing) - Goodnight, Joseph. - Goodnight. (ominous music) (faucet running) (footstep thumping) Morning. I'm gonna get some coffee, do you? Right. - I didn't think you two would hit it off so well. Joseph, meet Rafael. Rafael, Joseph. - We met. - No we haven't. - Last night. You might not remember. Who made the coffee? - Your boy did. - I'll get you some. - No, you don't have to. - What? - [Joseph] I didn't know how you took it, so. - Oh no, this is great. I hope you don't miss your ferry again. Sorry you missed it last night. - Mmmm. Yeah, I haven't decided yet. - Haven't decided what? - Might stay a little longer. - You think that's a good idea? You know, with all your work stuff going on. - Anabi invited us to a picnic if you wanna join us. Sorry, I meant to take your mind off your breakup. - Yeah, maybe you should. It might be good for you to be around other people, you know? - You know what? Thank you. I'll see if I can make it. (water trickling) - You made all this? - Yeah. It's my thing. - I thought Arabic was your thing. - I have many things, my child. (chuckling) - I found my I.D. last night. - You did? I thought the guy who mugged you took it. - He did. I found it on the floor here last night when Rafael came in. - Did he find it somewhere? - I don't know, I didn't ask. - Well, it's great that you got it back. Be way less of a hassle for going out. - Yeah. I just wonder how he got it, you know? It's not something a mugger would just casually drop. You know? - What're you suggesting? - Nothing. - You're meeting him at a weird time but I'm sure there's a logical explanation for how he found it. - Yeah, sure. - It seems to me I owe you an apology. We got interrupted last night, I think. - Yes we did. - Do you remember where we left off? - I think you were going over to get condoms. - No. Condoms and "stuff." (laughing) (somber music) (shower trickling) (waves crashing) (Joseph chuckling) What? - [Joseph] I can't believe I kicked him last night. I've never kicked anyone before. - [Cameron] And you said you couldn't be in the army. - [Joseph] How'd you guys meet? - Rafael? We grew up together. He was the only one who knew. For the longest. He helped me come out. Talked me through my first relationship and it's terrible end. We were scared and young but we had each other. You know? - I wish I had that. I mean, I know it's better now but I only had my mom. Never really talked about it. Now she's just obsessed with me getting married. (chuckling) - You don't have like a best friend or anything? (somber music) - If we had met the normal way would we still have hooked up? - Your little insecurity is so cute. - I'm not insecure. - [Cameron] Mm-hmm. - I'm not, I'm just curious. - Well, probably not. Because I don't really do random hookups. - I'm not insecure. I just don't want people to have power over me because of it. - What do you mean? - I remember a few years ago at the pride parade, a bunch of corporate floats started to appear and part of me was relieved that they were finally pandering to us. - Yeah, for your disposable income. - Still. I remember a group starting booing and chanting, "Bull shit," or whatever. They were pissed they had lost their half-naked leather drag queen parade. I was so pissed at them. They didn't understand what this meant. We wouldn't be outsiders anymore. (somber music) - Acceptance doesn't end maltreatment though. - That's not what I'm saying. - You are. - No, I'm not. - If you allow some existential fear to dictate your life, it makes you the prey, whether you're accepted or not. (sighing) - You got this all figured out, don't you? - Don't get mad. - I'm not mad. - You sound mad. - You just called me weak. - I was talking within the context... - Whatever. - I would've at least flirted with you. - Nice back-peddling. - Mm-hmm. Is it working? - Uh uh. - Hey. (laughing) Oh, you son of a... (laughing) - No, no, I have the glass. (waves sloshing) (ominous music) - [Cameron] Hey! - Fuck. (eerie music) (water sloshing) - You guys want a refill? - When do you wanna leave? - As soon as L gets back. - Oh, he's finally going to emerge from his mopey break-up cocoon? - Relax. Why, you wanna go put on a jockstrap just in case? - At least I have a jock strap. - I think he just went to the beach. (thudding) - Speak of the devil. (faint beat music) - L? I fucking texted you. L, if you're gonna be here, you need to act normal. - Here's chips and salsa, see? Normal. - What're you doing? Hey, I asked you something. - I found his stuff. - [Cameron] Who's stuff? - Someone was watching us! - Hey! Keep your fucking voice down. What're you talking about? - Someone was hiding in the bushes. I saw them run off and when I went back just now, I found this. - People hook in the Meat Rack all the time. How do you know that belongs to the... This could belong to anyone. L, you need to leave. - Not yet, I have to make sure... - No, you're acting like a fucking lunatic! Going back there night after night, you're gonna incriminate yourself. - There hasn't been a crime yet, remember? - The longer you're here, the sooner you're gonna get arrested. Or both of us. (knocking) - [Anabi] You guys ready? - [Cameron] Yeah, we'll be out in a minute. - Why do I feel like I just walked into a fight? - Would you mind taking these? Put them in the bag? - Sure. Sorry. - I'm not leaving until I find him. - And what's gonna happen if you do? We're leaving tonight, if I have to drag your drunk ass out of here myself. (sighing) - Yeah, I'm literally on a salt diet. Only salt. - Really? - It's working. - Wow. - Yeah. Oh my God, Cam, are you ready to go or what? - Actually, they need some help in there. Could make yourself useful? - Okay, bossy. - Hey. - Hey. Listen, we have to leave tonight. I'm sorry. Work came up and we have to head back, so, you should probably. - Oh. - I'm sorry. I really... - No, it's cool. - I can give you some money to cover your ferry, get you home okay. - Are you headed right back to D.C.? - [Anabi] Let's go, boys! (somber music) (ominous music) - Water damage. Yeah, it won't turn on. It was a long shot. - [Cameron] You ready? - Yeah. Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier. You know you're the closet thing I have to family, right? - Yeah. - [Rafael] I would never do anything to hurt you. - I know. - We're in this together. - Yeah. Coming with us? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll meet you there. - Hey, I could have someone take a look at that phone for... - I got it. Don't worry about it. (unsettling music) (waves sloshing) - And that is how Fire Island got its name. It's true. (laughing) - I heard that there used to be a pirate that inhabited the island and he made his living by pillaging booty. - [Shane] What kind of booty? - [Tony] He would find a shallow area in the break and stick these large wooden shafts into the ocean floor. - Oh, my kind of weekend. - But it's true. In the pitch dark of night, he would build these huge bonfires on the beach that could be seen for miles and miles. Passing ships would see the fires and think it was an SOS, so they would run-aground, not realizing that their ships were about to get stuck on those poles. And so, when the crews would make it to shore, the pirate would appear out of nowhere and slaughter them all, before looting the ships. - Oh, I keep going to sleep, oh my God. - [Tony] To this day, it's called Fire Island because of those fires, a false SOS. - How is this a ghost story? - You didn't say "ghost story," you said "scary story." - And it wasn't even scary, R.L. Stine! - I like the lesbian pirates better. - Hey, Cam? Cameroon? I hate to whine but can you give me some red? - [Cameron] It's all the way back at the house. You can get it yourself. - You're already up, so. - [Cameron] So what, that makes me a little bitch? - No. What? - I can go. I need to pee anyways. - [Sam] Awww, see? Gay Chivalry isn't dead. Thanks sweetie. - You know where everything is? - Yeah. I can manage without you. - I'm so bored with these snacks. - [Tony] Did I ever tell you guys about how the Back End got its name? - So, L came out of his cave, huh? Did he talk to you about Marcus at all? - Not really. - You know what happened? (ominous music) (keys jingling) - Hey. Sorry, did I scare you? - No. - They need some booze too, so I thought I'd come help out. - Okay. - So, you gonna let me in or? - Yeah, sorry. You know, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. I know you're really important to Cam and, again, I'm sorry about last night. - Me too. Did you get your I.D. back, by the way? - I did. Thank you. (ominous music) - [Rafael] You okay? (laughing) - I thought Marcus left yesterday. - He did, why? - Jean was saying that he didn't come into work today. That's kinda weird, right? - He and L broke up. - Oh my God, like seriously? - So I'm guessing he took the day off. - Oh, they ended their engagement here? During this trip? Fuck. That's so weird. Why wouldn't they tell any of us? - [Cameron] I think they just wanted some privacy. - [Sam] Well, I guess that explains why L's been such a dick. (laughing) - Remind me, again, what you do for a living. - I'm a lawyer. - [Rafael] Do you like it? - I do. - Criminal law? - No. - Do you consider yourself an honest person, Joseph? - Lawyer's don't have a reputation of being honest, but yes, yes, I do consider myself an honest person. Why? - Because I think you're lying to me. I think you're hiding something. I found this. Is that yours? - No. - No? Huh. That's weird because I found this in there too. (phone clicking) (eerie music) - You didn't see where L went, did you? - Maybe he's taking a sand dump. - I'm serious. (chuckling) - I don't know. (ominous music) - L! - What do you want? - I wanna know why you turned my best friend against me. - I, I, I... - Stop fucking lying! You lied about your clothes, you lied about your phone! You're a fucking liar! - I told you everything. - No, no, no. This is what's gonna fucking happen. You're gonna leave tonight on the next ferry and you're gonna take the first train back to your lonely little life and you're never gonna speak about this again. What you did, who you met, what you saw. Like a little lying lawyer that you are. Because if you do, I'll know. I will find you and I will kill you. All right, Joseph? All right? - All right. I won't say anything. - I know you won't. Cowards never do. - Is that what you said about Marcus? (ominous music) (groaning) (gagging) (coughing) - Get off him! L! Hey, wake up. Hey! Joseph.
