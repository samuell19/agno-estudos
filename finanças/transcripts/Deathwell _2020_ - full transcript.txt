- Hey! Hey! Dude! Could you open the door? Hey, excuse me, please open the-- - No, fuck out of here! - Oh, dude! I just got pepper sprayed around the corner over there. This psycho bitch, literally, she took my purse, she took my shoes. I mean, I-- - I feel your pain, alright, but I'm not letting you in here right now, so go the fuck away! - I'm not trying to get in your car, okay? I just wanna use your phone. - Yo, seriously, now is not a good time! - Seriously! It is the day after Christmas, I mean, where is your goodwill towards your fellow human being? Can you think about how fucked up my night has been? For just two seconds! Just think about it! I lost my phone, I lost my shoes, I lost my purse, my eyes are fucking burning! I just wanna use your phone! I got to meet this producer in like 10 minutes. - Producer? - Yes, yes. I'm the lead singer in this band, "Butterfly Porn". I'm Butterfly! Seriously, is everyone in this town a complete fucktard! And you! You! You are the biggest fucktard of them all! Come on, seriously, fuck you! All right. All right. You have five seconds to let me use your phone or I'm screaming. Five, four, three, two... Help! Help! This is guy is, he pepper sprayed me! - You are fucking insane! - Let me use your phone, you piece of human garbage! - Man, fuck you! Here. - What's your name, wierdo? - Don't worry about it. - Relax. I'm not some kooky stalker chick, I just wanna know whose phone I'm using. - Chester. My name is Chester. - Chester. What's with the ancient-ass phone? - Yo, I hate you, seriously. I fucking hate you. - You're like my new favorite person. - You have reached the voicemail-- - Shit. Didn't answer. But you know, thanks for the phone, Chester! And uh, Merry Christmas! - What the fuck? - He ain't tell me he was on this side, shit. Got me pulling over to this fucking part of the fucking... - My man. - We good? - Yeah. - Sup with you, man? You actin' like somebody died or something. - I got a fucked up feeling about this shit. - You got to manifest positive outcome, bro. Visualize it. - Wildfires, earthquakes, tsunamis, fucking nuclear war! That's the vision I keep having! I'd probably feel better if I wasn't waiting in the fucking car! - I told you, they don't like talking to strangers, man. You gonna meet 'em when the time is right. So until then, enjoy the free promo that this song is given our merchandise. I wanna go to Blue Heaven! Heaven! - I hate this fucking song, man. Shit is trash! - This song is gonna make us rich, bro! - Still hate it. - Man word on the street is "Fuck The World" is a variant. - I don't know what a variant is. - The rapper "Fuck The World". - What about him? - They saying that he's a genetically modified human organism, maybe even AI. Nobody's ever seen him before! - Whatever, man, let's get out this fucking block. - Let me use your phone real quick though. - What's wrong with your shit? - It died. - Yo man, everybody asking to use my fucking phone tonight, man. - Bruh, what the f? Look at this, man! - Nigga, laugh all you want nigga! I'm off the grid, nigga, no smartphone, no social media, nigga, fuck "People To People", nigga! - Not long from now, all U.S. citizens will soon be required to register with a digital identification database, under a newly passed bill titled, "People To People". This comes after a recent congressional panel, surprisingly votes in favor of legalizing personal drug possession without authorization. These extreme measures have been met with resistance from liberals and conservatives alike, prompting a growing number of protests, petitions, and conspiracy theories that are gaining traction. - I'm off the grid, nigga, no smartphone, no social media, nigga, fuck "People To People", nigga! Catch me if you can! - You know I hate it when you come in bed with your dirty ass clothes on. It's gross! - Your breath is gross. - Whatever. You're such a little kid. - Damn. Bruh, nobody has this shit! How'd you get it? - Can't yet reveal the plug. I wanna go to Blue Heaven. I hate that fucking song, man. Anyway. - How much for the blue juice? - Two. - Ah, shit. Talk to Izzy lately by any chance? - Why? - I don't know about that fool. Word is your boy's a federal informant. - Shut the fuck up. - No, seriously he's a fucking opp. - How do you know? - I got people in New York that know him. Rat motherfucker! - I don't fuck with Izzy like that. - Anyway. Stay up, man. Keep a eye out for them snakes. I wanna go to Blue Heaven. - Hey, can you grab my laundry? - Why can't you get it? - Beause I asked nicely. - You know there's a Nazi living next to us now? - I seen him. - He makes me uncomfortable. - You ain't got to worry about him. - Well, you gotta be careful when you're out there with that stuff. - Drugs are legal now and you of all people should know it. - Legal to possess, still very much illegal to traffic. - How are people supposed to possess it if someone doesn't traffic it to them, huh? Riddle me that shit. - Seriously, Keenan, if you keep this shit up, when I do pass the bar, you're gonna be my first client. - Thought that's why you wanted to become a lawyer in the first place. - You're fucking impossible dude. - Be sure to keep those calls coming in, if you want to be caller 1-9-9 and get those free tickets to "Flex Fest" going down this Saturday at the forum in Inglewood. You don't wanna miss that! And up next, we got the new fire from, "Fuck The World". The number one song in the country right now. You already know it's that "Blue Heaven". Keep it locked right here on-- - Who just moved here six months ago, okay? I was born and raised in this city. Los Angeles has always been a Lakers, Dodgers, Trojans, Bruins and now Rams once again. Don't talk to me about the Angels, Chargers and Clippers ever in your life. Why do the Clippers still play in Staples Center? Why do the Angels have Los Angeles in their name? What are the Chargers even doing here at all? Nobody asked for them and nobody cares. - Hey, I'm trying to study back there. Do mind telling the "Hitler Youth" to turn it the fuck down? - Yeah? - Hey man I-- - Benjamin. My name is Benjamin. You can call me Ben, what's up? - Whatever, can you turn the fucking music down? Please. - What's going on out there Ben? - It's the guy from next door, he wants us to turn our music down! - What? - I said it's our next door neighbor and he wants us to turn our shit down. Turn it down, Hailey. - What? - I said turn it the fuck down, Hailey! Right now! - Thanks. - You're welcome, neighbor. - It's a form of meditation, really, you have to be present and in the moment. When you understand it's basic principles, you become more in tune with your own pleasure receptors and therefore, understand how to better pleasure your partner. Plus, the transmutation of energy that happens, can intensify the climax into other worldly levels of ecstasy. And that's where it got its name from... Blue Heaven. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. - So... how's the wife? - We're not married. - When does she graduate? - Spring. - Tell Mimi to text me. Oh, what are you guys doing for New Years? - Yeah? - Keenan, Thank God you answered, bro. - Izzy? The fuck are you? - I'm locked up, in Vegas. - Shut the fuck up! The fuck happened? - I got caught with a pistol by a narc at the Palms making a sale. They're giving me a gun charge! I also got hit with an intent to sell for the Blue Heaven, can you even believe that shit? - Rat motherfucker! - Keenan? - Fuck! - Keenan, you still-- - This better not be anybody calling my phone from fucking jail! - Are you a gambling man, Keenan? You look like a gambling man. I know I sure am. I would've set the over under of you answering your phone to maybe 50 to one. And it's a good thing you did it may have saved your life, for the moment at least. - Who the fuck is this? - I'm nobody to you. If you were smart, you would keep it that way. - Either tell me who the fuck you are or I'm hanging up. - Very well. I represent the product you've been peddling around town, product that was given to you on consignment, by people who will do bodily harm to you and everybody you love. If they don't get all that is owed to them. That is who I am, Keenan Milhouse. - How the fuck you get this number? - How do you think? Your business partner, Israel. - Yo, I can't really talk right now, so how about you give me your number and I'll call you tomorrow? - You may not be alive that long. So unfortunately, it looks like we're going to have this discussion right here, at 7-11. Don't even think about driving away or you will be shot dead on command. Fuck! Yeah? - If you hang up on me again, you are worm food. Understood? - All right, man, what's up? - As you may or may not know, your business partner is currently incarcerated across state lines. And by being an idiot and getting himself busted, he took with him a mini fortune's worth of our shit. More specifically, my shit. Not only that, but he has been denied bail and is being extradited back to New York City, where he has a number of open cases. We may never hear from him again. - Izzy has to cover his own ass, all right? - You're a funny man, Keenan. You're a very funny man. - Seriously, whoever the fuck you are, I don't have that kind of capital right now, so we have to work some shit out. - That is good to hear. I am glad that you were willing to work something out, as that is precisely the reason we are talking right now. - All right, let's hear it. - Here is what is going to happen. You will be given an assignment that is to be completed within the hour and the terms of this assignment are non-negotiable. Are we clear on the assignment? - Actually, I see a picture and an address, nothing else. Yo, you can't be fucking serious! He could be somebody, like fucking important! - I can assure you, he is not, but who he is should not matter to you, just handle business and you will have nothing to worry about. Your mark is getting on a plane tonight. So there will be a car service picking him up from his home and driving him to LAX at 11:00 PM. It is imperative that he does not reach the airport. - Nah, can't do it, bro. Sorry. - I like how Mimi wore her hair today. It almost reminded me of my sister. I also hear she's preparing to take the bar exam. In my opinion, this girl is way too good for a scumbag like you. And it would be shameful if she were to die because of you. - So I do this and we're good? - If you are successful, you will live to see at least one more day. I can't promise you anything else. You have 40 minutes. - Finally showed up, huh? Actually I was getting a little bit worried. - Don't fucking move! - All right, take it easy, kid. I ain't going to move. I just feel a little insulted here. Tell me, kid, how much are they commissioning you for tonight's work, huh, Picaso? How much is the life of a B-movie producer worth? I got to know before I check out of here. Come on, tell me before-- - Stop fucking talking! - All right, okay. All right, take it easy. Please tell me that you're not indebted to these fucks and that's why you're doing this. Because if you are, Jesus Christ, kid you have no fucking idea how bad you're fucked. Let me tell you something once you get involved with these people, there's no fucking way out, don't you understand that? Trust me, I know. And I look at you and I think, that's me back in the 80s! You remind me of me. When cocaine was hot shit and I was peddling it all over town. I ended up owing the same people that you worked for money too. But I made a deal, just like I'm sure you made a deal. But the only difference, kid, I'm an asset. I make pictures. Okay, they're fucking terrible, but what do you bring to the table? What's the value of your brain? Let me tell you something kid, I made more fucking money for these assholes, than you could make in a million fucking years. And look what's gonna happen to me. Now ask yourself a question, kid, what do you think is gonna happen to you eventually? - Make another sound old man I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking-- - What are you gonna do, kill me? Ain't I already dead? Can't you see what's going on here, kid? I'm just trying to impart a little bit of wisdom before I fucking-- - Well, it's about fucking time! - Yo, I'm on my way home now. - Good! Because you have some major fucking explaining to do! And you owe me Pho anytime I want for at least a month. - Yo, listen! - Hello? Keenan? - Yo, have you noticed any abnormal activity around the building? Like some sketchy looking gangster types, lurking? - You know what? Actually... Yup, they're still there. - Who's still there? - These creepers, they've been parked across the street the whole day. They've left and come back a couple of times. Definitely not feeling their energy. - Yo, don't go anywhere near that fucking car, all right? Stay in the fucking apartment. - Keenan, What the fuck is going on? - I'll explain when I get home and if anything weird happens, you call me right away! Aww, shit. - Keenan, what the fuck? - Good morning, Mr Milhouse. You'll be here a while. - Hi, Chester. - I just want to know whose phone I'm using. - Chester, my name is Chester. - Chester. - I am Special Agent Merchant. Violent crimes. Narcotics. Cyber terrorism. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. Young lady behind me is my trainee. Tops in her class. I believe you two have already met. No? So, can I get you anything? The PB and J is exceptional here! - How'd I end up in the infirmary? - You got a little testy with some of the guards a couple of weeks back. Messed you up real bad. - A couple of weeks? How long have I been in here? - 28 days. - First thing's first. Mr. Milhouse, I actually want to commend you for not being typical of this generation. With most anybody nowadays, you can uncover pretty much anything you need to know about them in 30 seconds. Their entire history. But you, Mr. Milhouse, are different. Wait, you have no smartphone, no YouTube videos of you punching yourself in the face or any of that viral dumb shit. No digital footprint whatsoever. Even a thorough background scan with all of our resources, only pulls up fragments of you here and there. It's like.... you don't exist. Which is precisely how you ended up on our radar to begin with. By being a ghost. You are a prime example of why "People To People" had to be initiated. So that viruses like you couldn't lie dormant any longer. - Viruses like me, huh? - I'm sure that you understand the severity of the situation you're in. You are looking at a myriad of federal charges, the sum total of which, is well beyond any of the years that we have left on this planet. So in other words, Mr. Milhouse, your life is theoretically over. - You still haven't told me. - I haven't told you what? - You still haven't told me what I'm being charged with. - I'll let your lawyer explain that to you. But... that may not even be necessary. Today could be your lucky day, Mr. Milhouse. If you let be. - It's so good to have you back. Those assholes wouldn't let me see you in there for some reason, I don't know what that was about. And what's the deal with this? Does it hurt? Here, let me see. What's wrong? What the hell? - Dude, it's time to see a doctor. There's probably too much acid in your blood. What did they feed you in there? - Close the door. - Dear God, can you make me a fucking bird already! Hey dude! You alive over there? If you are alive dude, don't eat that mountain of green shit. Everything in here can kill you, the food, the water, the people, even the fucking air. Why do you think the CO's wear those masks? Do you even know where the fuck you landed? I'm willing to bet you were so doped up when they brought you in, you don't even remember the last 24 hours do you? Do you remember riding on a bus? An old clunky bus with bright red lights in front? Of course you don't, dude! It's all part of their fucked up game. The one where they pump your veins full of "god knows what" and give you a one-way ticket to hell. - I'm gonna stab you in the eye with a fucking fork! - Where the fuck am I? - You're on the "Mount Olympus", dude. - Where? - Olympio Federal, aka, the underground prison, maximum security. Located in Nowhere, USA! You made it to the bottom of the fucking earth! Congrats! - Underground prison? What the fuck? - You've officially been flushed. How does it make you feel? Used, abandoned, all of the above? The majority of the population on the outside doesn't know this place exists. It's where they bury people that "they" don't want around anymore. For whatever reason. - I hear there's even an entire wing full of aliens. - Let me guess, you got arrested with a bunch of dope on you that you thought was legal, because of the new drug laws, right? And once you're in Olympio that's the end of life as you know it. - No parole. No release date. - Not even a goddamn presidential pardon can free you from this shithole. Do you want to know why you didn't have an arraignment? Bond hearring? Or fair trial by jury of your peers? - Why not? - This new left neo-liberal globalist agenda, that's trying its hardest to put the final nail in the coffin of our once great nation. And we can't let that happen without military action! - Amen to that! - These anti-male, anti-white, anti-American libtards, would actually lead you people to believe, that our country would have been better off if that crooked lady got elected back in 2016. I mean, seriously. I mean, it's bad enough that we had that smooth talking African-born terrorist sympathizer in the White House for all those fucking years. - And we've spent the last how many years cleaning up that mess? - And the Zionist occupied mass media that preys on your fears and uses their own sense of twisted self-righteous morality, against you. And they'll do things like, just to exploit the deaths of children to manipulate you into giving up your rights to bear arms. So you can't protect yourself or your loved ones. They aim to stop our mobility and take away our God given American birth right to free speech, while they spread their lies. First, it was collusion, then we had obstruction. Our 45th president was under attack from day fucking one! You know, Mueller and the rest of those traders should be fucking castrated! - God only knows what's in store for America. - These snowflakes are so hell-bent on taking every last drop of dignity our country had and willingly whoring it over to any refugee with a brood of seven, sneaking over in the dark of night, lying and wait to take your job, your house and your fucking life from you. This war is coming people and I'm not talking about some goddamn race war, okay? I'm talking about World War fucking three! And that's our fucking show. Until next time, on the Soaring Eagle. - Our streams are down, like, way down. - We've hit the proverbial wall. - Has our audience lost faith in us? - They think we're all talk, that's for sure. Our message is extreme and we're not aggressive enough. - So what are we going to do? How do we make them believe again? - I think Ben should run for local office, that would be a huge power play. - We live in the most liberal city in the most liberal state in America, Hailey, did you forget that? - Yeah, but there are plenty of people like us here. People that are sick and tired of being sick and tired of the liberals. - Political pageantry isn't going to cut it, we need to send a violent message in the name of the movement. - We can start by killing rappers. - Rappers Dirk? What the fuck for? - For influencing the youth to be fucking idiots! And drug addicts! And their blatant disrespect for all womankind! - Except that their jungle noise does more harm to their own people than to ours. That's the thing about "the blacks", they're self-destructive. Like the homeboy who lives next door to us. I mean, he's just a fucking waste of life. - Yeah, I feel sorry for his girlfriend. - And I tried being cool with that dickhead, didn't I? But not anymore, man. Fuck that guy! He's in for a rude awakening! - Yes! Yeah fuck that motherfucker man! - What is it, Keenan? What the hell are you doing right now? What the fuck is your problem, dude, seriously? Where you going? The pizza's gonna be here any minute. - Keenan's energy has just been completely off and it's affecting literally everything. I can't even study right now. - It's this New Moon we're under, we need to go crystal shopping ASAP. - I don't know, but Keenan has definitely not been himself since he's been home. And he's not talking about what happened to him inside. - You think that maybe they zapped his brain while he was locked up? - Like a lobotomy? - I saw this post last night on Instagram that seriously fucked me up. - And tell me it wasn't any of those conspiracy meme pages you follow. - One of my friends re posted it from a respectable news outlet if you must know. - Whatever. What was the post? - It was linked to this article about the alleged cruel and unusual punishment, that's been going down since these new drug laws passed. They've been doing all this gnarly shit to inmates in federal facilities without their consent! Like, infecting them with diseases and other ridiculousness! - No fucking way. I refuse to believe that. - You need to wake the fuck up Mimi! There's a war going on out there that none of us are safe from! You even said yourself, they wouldn't let you visit him when he was locked up. Just imagine all that could have happened. - He wasn't in there for that long. But if there's even an ounce of truth to what you were saying, there is going to be major fucking hell to pay to a whole lot of people when I pass the bar! Because the shit storm that I'm going to rain down on them, is gonna be fucking monumental! We will take down at the city, the state, the fucking Department of Corrections, the fucking White House if we have to! Who is it? Stella, I'll call you back, someone's at the door. Actually, stay on the line, I'm a little freaked out right now. - Why? What's happening? Mimi, I'm coming over there and I'm bringing my 22 caliber! - It's okay, Stella, hold on. - Mimi, right? - Sorry, I don't believe we've met. - Nah, I'm one of Keenan's friends. Heard he got out recently. Is he around? How long has he been out? Of jail, that is. - Who the fuck are you, dude? - I'll try callin' him again. Thanks though. - Mimi? Hello, Mimi, are you there? - I don't know what makes you think you can come home whenever the fuck you want? What, so you're just gonna act like-- You have to tell me what you remember about prison. - Don't eat that mountain of green shit! Don't eat that mountain of green shit! - Dude! You good over there? It's the water dude! I told you it was spiked! Now you're having projections. - It feels like my fucking head is in a fucking vice! Open the fucking door! Let me the fuck out of here! Open the fucking door! Let me fucking out of here! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! What now, huh! Keep talking! Told you to shut up! - Not so tough now are you? - That'll keep you quiet. - What now you little bitch? This is what happens when you talk too much! -Let's get outta here. Save the government some money. - Fuck! Feels like my fucking head is in a fucking vice! - The madness is only beginning, dude, I hate to break it to you. Hey, dude, there might be some sun at the end of this shit storm. - What the fuck you talking about? - I mean I might have found a way outta here. - Can I ask you something? - What the fuck is your problem? I mean, where did you get the fucking balls? You, you, walk around here, like you own the fucking world! And you shit on me every time I offer up a gesture of peace! And in all honesty, dude, I should've stomped a fucking mud hole in your head a long time ago. I swear to God, man. I swear to fucking God, if you ever come banging on my door again. I mean, if you say anything, if you do anything, if you even look at me fucked up, I am gonna fucking kill you! Understand? I'm gonna take this tiny little head of yours and bash it in with a fucking hammer, and that's gonna be the end of you! Fuck you, dude! Fuck your whole fucking life! - God I slept way too long. Now I'm gonna be up all night. I think I'm gonna cook something before I start studying. What are you in the mood for? What in the fuck? Keenan! Please tell me you did not eat my fucking book! Are you a fucking German Shepard? What the... Oh my God! I knew it! I fucking knew it! - Yo, yo, yo! - Who the fuck invited you in? - Chill, shawty, you left your door unlocked. Not a good way to keep people out. My man, Keenan! What's good? Long time no hear from... Everything cool? Let's take a ride. - I've been trying to holla at you, man, but you straight ghosted me. Matter of fact, the last time we was on the phone together you hung up on me. What's up with that? You know the judge threw out my gun charge in Vegas. Threw it out. Magical. Heard the feds had your ass too. I heard that you ain't even have visitation, but somehow you got out. What's up with that Key? You know what's wild man? Your girl is so loyal. I dig that. I had a girl too, but she snitched on me. Ain't that crazy? You know what's even crazier than that? Those motherfuckers that we work for, man, these foreigners, lord, they some cold blooded motherfuckers. These the kind of motherfuckers, if you do something for 'em, then they own you. And I know you did something for 'em before you went in. I dig that you did what you had to do, you ain't really all had no choice. They would've raped your girl, made you watch, killed her, killed you brutally probably would've cut both of your heads off. Might of even castrated your ass. Man. At the end of the day, man, both of us saw big money opportunity and we took it. It's too bad that they sent me to kill you. - We've got to investigate the trailer. It's most likely abandoned. - Abandoned? Fuck, no, man! For all we know Walter White's in there cooking with an AR 15 on the stove. - Yeah I think we should just. leave it alone and keep moving. - Dudes, we've got to start taking our fucking chances. We need food and water, change of clothes would be nice too. You act like it's a fucking Airbnb. At the very least there's some off the grid doomsday prepper in there, who doesn't want to be fucked with. We also just escaped from prison or did you fucking forget? We don't know how far away from civilization we are. We don't even know what fucking state we're in. In just a few short hours, that high-desert sun is gonna be beating down on us. We're gonna be on a fast track to dying of thirst. - Fuck! You got a point. - Let's all go check it out then together. - It'd be better if we send in a probe, that way we can see if there's movement from our vantage point. - Fuck it, rock, paper, scissors! Fuck me! - In case I get killed, my name was Keenan. - I'm Patrick. - And I'm Patrick. - How the fuck are both of your names Patrick? - He's gonna get killed - For sure. - Holy shit! - How come you two failed to mention you've been brothers this whole time? - Brothers? Do we look like fucking brothers to you? - You two are fucking identical twins. - Wrong again, genius. This fucker's a variant, like "Blade Runner". They're called, Replicants in "Blade Runner", you fucking mongoloid. - Gargle gas, you science project! - This fucker is the variant, not me! - I don't know what a variant is. - It's a genetically modified human organism. - Wait, hold up, variant? - Why you sound so surprised? - Because I am fucking surprised! - Why do you think they sent you to Olympio in the first place? That's where they send all the viruses that they deem glitches in the United States of the fucking Matrix! - That's the game they play. Lock you up, swallow the key. Send some Frankenstein schizoid version of you out in the world in your place. - All while they play sick little sadistic games with the actual you. - It's like electric shock therapy. - Only like a zillion times more fucked up! - So, the rapper, "Fuck The World". - A total fucking variant. - And it's no coincidence, that shitty ass song blew up the way it did. They made sure their prodcut got all the promo it needed. - Their product? - Where do you think Blue Heaven even came from? Who created it? I hear it makes black men styrile. Blue Heaven is what they caught you with when they brought you in, huh, Keenan? - Yo, how the fuck are they able to get away with this shit? - Who's gonna stop 'em? You? - This is bigger than Olympio Prison. - It's bigger than America. - There's a war going on outside that none of us are fucking safe from. - New World Order. Get down or lay down. It's the law of the land. - All right, so you're telling me it's possible they sent some fucking variant home in my place? - Most likely. - I can only imagine what Courtney is going through without me. - You mean without me. Dip shit. - Fuck off! Courtney is my girl! You don't even know anything about her. - Why don't you try me then, asshole? - What's her mom's name? - Katie. - What's your stepdad's name? - Gary. - What's her middle name? - She doesn't have one, idiot. - What's her dog's name? - Mowgli. - What's her favorite TV show? - Used to be "Game Of Thrones". - What's her favorite movie? - All the "Harry Potter" films. - What's she allergic to? - You! - Your a fucking disease! - Fuck you! That's the mother of my future kids you're talking about. - How? I already knocked her up. - Fuck! - Hey, where you going? Fucking pussy. - They deliberately forgot that God made the heavens long ago by the word of his command. Then he used the water to destroy the ancient world with a mighty flood. And by the same word, the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire. They are kept for the day of judgment, when the ungodly people will be destroyed! Hello, stranger. - Hello. - Would you like to sit up front? - Okay. - So tell me, stranger, who are you exactly? - I knew who I was this morning, but I've changed a few times since then. - Like, "Alice In Wonderland". So the better question might have been, what are you exactly? - I don't know. - How do you not know by now? - I'm Keenan Milhouse. If I'm not Keenan Millhouse, who am I? - I don't know who or what you are exactly, but I do know where you are going. - Where am I going? - To hell! Put down the gun! Put down the gun! Put down the-- - Good morning, Mr. Milhouse. - Good morning, Mr. Milhouse.
