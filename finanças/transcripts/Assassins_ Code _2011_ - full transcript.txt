[MUSIC PLAYING] Ms. Crane is in. She'll see you in 12 minutes. Certainly. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Why isn't this a surprise? Well, I guess you guys want to get it right, huh? Hello. Fuck. I have definitely been here before. Not on this side of the table. Are these really necessary? Brill? You out there? You think this all began with the archangel killings? You're wrong. It started with Paul Thorn, Paul Rand. It started with nightmares. [MUSIC PLAYING] You've done it again. [SCREAMS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi, Paul. Is that guy stalking you? Maybe. Because I can bust him, you know. I can shoot him, legally. Thank you, Maria. Seven or ten bullets, sir? You choose. Seven. Guess you'll need the 1911 then. Paul, with the amount of money you've spent on rentals over the past couple of years, you could have bought three pistols already. He's still weird. [GUN SHOTS] You know, Paul, if you're in some sort of trouble, I understand you running under the radar. You think my last name is Chen? Here. Take it. No numbers, no nothing. No thanks. You don't own a gun? Must be because you lack skills. He is better than you. Shut up, Luke. [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Happy anniversary. How you doing, man? You know what God says when you see something like that? There must be a me. I mean, look at her. How does she do it? How did you find me? It's who I am, remember? It's what I do. I find people who usually don't want to be found. I didn't want to disappear forever, just for a while. Well, it's been a little while Paul Thorn. Looks like they patched you up pretty good. Remember anything about the accident? They told me I was fucked up, but my wife was dead. Why wasn't she wearing her seat belt, Paul? Clean now? I don't even take aspirin. When you murder your wife, it tends to make you see things differently. Well, I'm sure she forgives you. PAUL: That makes it worse. DANIEL DODD: You seeing anybody now? PAUL: No. DANIEL DODD: You happy here? PAUL: You mean, would I'd be happy killing for the government again? DANIEL DODD: Have you ever killed anybody that didn't need killing? We'd get a black file, some pictures. What did we really know? That never bothered you before. I didn't feel anything before. You know, those Archangel workers were killed about 4 miles from here. You hit 11 out of 12 of them. You didn't think of calling? The 12th was a co-owner, Sameer Fazli. He went missing. I got a call this morning from him. Said he'd offer me information for protection. I'm going to meet with him tonight. Back me up? I have plans. Oh-- oh, you got plans. Oh, what kind of plans? The kind where you don't have to kill anyone. Well, you know where I live. PAUL: Danny, call me later. Man, there must be a me. The job gave Thorn a bad cocaine habit. And that habit killed his wise. Do the math. What habits do you have, Agent? But you know, he actually got clean in Narcotics Anonymous for three years. I think you're next. Thank you. Hi. I lost my daughter to-- I lost my daughter to my ex-husband who's worse off than me. I mean, those courts, they don't care about the truth. You know, they don't care about who's rightest or wrongest. They just want to move my kid around so it looks like they're working. I've been clean, you know, and it's not right. It's not right. I've been clean. So I'll keep going. Paul. Yeah? We-- we've been keeping track, son. Happy birthday. Paul. Paul. Hey, you won't tell anyone I'm here, will you? I mean because I like just joined the force five minutes ago and stuff. It's anonymous. Yeah, OK. Want to go get some coffee? Hot date, marriage, kids, live happily ever after. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] - Let's go. - Tired yet? Ladies, serve my friend. [LAUGHTER] You better let it go. Sausages are ready. PAUL: Hey, Laura, let me see that tattoo. Paul. Now I get to see Aunt Lou's birthmark. Come on now. You told him about my birthmark? Well, someday we're going to be showing this to our children. Yeah, so he can see how his dad died of a massive heart attack. Look at that meat he put on his place. [LAUGHTER] You guys are crazy. I'll be back. Hey, bud, you OK? [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] [GLASS SHATTERS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Danny. Danny. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: What's on it? [GUN SHOTS] [GUN SHOTS] TIMOTHY POWERS: We thought it would be easy. Grab the disk, then scare the occupant into signing a confidentiality agreement, patriotic duty, and all that shit. And then go home. Maybe even get Dodd to the hospital in time. Why do you think Dodd didn't inform you or us? Is that a real question? [MUSIC PLAYING] Novak, Peterson, Corey, Turner, Latham, Riley, Torres, Piper. Jesus. Know him? Paul Thorn killed eight of my men. Maybe he wasn't alone. Maybe he handed off the disk and created a diversion. That's a hell of a diversion, don't you think. Look at James. Let's run a check on Dodd, see if we can find a connection with Thorn. What's on this disks, sir? That's a kneed to know. You don't know, do you, Chief Powers? That's because I don't need to know, Agent Brief. AGENT POWERS [VOICEOVER]: Who was she? No one. A nurse, Stacia something. Only mark on her record was a DUI she got when she was upset over her divorce. AGENT POWERS [VOICEOVER]: But to have the balls to help a wounded man crouched beside a dumpster, she must have been doing penance for some sin. Way things turned out, it must have been a pretty good one. Wait. Please. Is that a 45? Do you like guns? Are you going to rape me? No more questions. Sorry. I talk when I'm nervous. Your arm will get infected. You could fix it at your place. Drive. OK. AGENT BRIEF: This doesn't read like the home of a vicious killer. Whoever Paul Thorn, he's a pro. Riley here was our best. And Thorn outdrew him. Yep. After he took out Corey and Peterson. Look, we're going to be OK. Should I call Mr. Brill or Mr. Altman? No. I'll call Brill, and Brill will call Altman. Fucking chain of command. Go ahead. Maybe it is the home of a vicious killer. Jesus Christ. PAUL: I'm not kidnapping you. My name is Paul Rand. And I used to work for the government. I just worked a double shift at st. Mary's ER. So why don't you just get to the part that happened right before you abducted me at gun point. My friend broke into my house, gave me this, and died on my floor. What is it? All that's left of Archangel's inventory. The massacre on TV. You? Then give it to the police. They killed my friend Dodd. They'll kill me too. When will he be back? An hour. Where is he? He left. He left seven months ago. Look, some women are hooked on vodka. I was hooked on vodka and Charles. I'm hooked. I was hooked. Whatever. I need your computer. You're holding the gun. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Tony. This must be bad news. Someone else has it. And I lost it. Paul Thorn. Dodd broke into his house. Dodd? Dead. I'll take care that. This Thorn killed eight men. Eight? Yeah. It would help me find him if I knew what was on the disk. I don't really know myself, Tony. Hey, you want to join us? Nah. I got to pick up some pieces. Hm. [PHONE RINGING] [TRAFFIC SOUNDS] [PHONE RINGING] Sending a 20. Ah, fuck. I need Arlo. What's an Arlo? A friend. Surprised you have any. [MUSIC PLAYING] Did you sleep yet? Bad dreams. I've got to get out of here. Arlo. Am I going with you? I haven't decided. REPORTER [ON TV]: Police aren't releasing much information about the gun fight that took place here between several federal agents. The battle left eight men dead and a dangerous suspect at large. Police and federal authorities are looking for Paul Thorn, the owner of house. Thorn should be considered dangerous even though at this point he's only wanted for questioning. You killed those men. PAUL: I had no choice. Like you didn't kill the people from the computer company. Stay there. Stay there. [GUN COCKING] I promise I won't call the police. What if there's a fire. You can't leave me like this. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [MUSIC PLAYING] How can I help you, mister? You've got one sick sense of humor, mister. You know that, don't you? [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] Arlo. Danny's dead. Like you or for real? He was killed for this. What's on it? Hm, I don't know. I know who he is. Mighty nice of Altman to let one of our axis of evil enemies access his desktop. I wonder if Karl Kim gets a pension from us too. ARLO: Now, if I had something really important that I could die for, I'd probably install some kick-ass security system. And maybe even a nasty virus so nobody can mess with it. Why the hell did you let me go on thinking you were gone, you asshole? Sorry, Arlo. Well, this little bastard can let us read the disk without it knowing that we've got access to it. You know, I cried at your funeral, dickhead. PAUL: What's this? You know, the government hasn't really had that much business for me. So when I'm not doing surveillance, I do repairs. It covers the mortgage. [WHIRRING] There, in a little while it'll crack the code. Spec 4. Arlo Gentry. Good. [DIALING PHONE] Yes, I found him. [PHONE RINGING] Sir, I'm point man on this operation. Where are you getting you intel? Well, if you're point man, Tony, what do I have to get it for you at all. [MUSIC PLAYING] Jesus Christ. Geraldine Crane. She's the goddess of the computer world. An engineer? She owns engineers. A good portion of the science world too. She's a business genius. I can't believe I'm looking at her private files. She made $1 billion working for the Defense Department, you know, the stealth fighter and a few other secret stuff there. Then she broke away to have more freedom in a small company. PAUL: Like Archangel. Yeah, she probably thought a smaller company would be less visible, but it wasn't smart enough. PAUL: Why would someone want her dead? [BEEP] - Holy shit. Is that what I think it is. I've never met this woman. But if she's associated to this thing, I want her dead. [BANGING] [GUNFIRE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNFIRE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll trade with you. Daniel Dodd. I had my men staking out Fazli's place, the guy from Archangel. Dodd showed up. He didn't know who we were. We didn't know who he was. And they followed him to my house. Yeah. And then my friends shot back. Sorry. You were there, huh? No. So how the fuck did you know what happened? Show him the disk. What's on it? I don't know what's on the disk. You don't know what's on the disk? BRILL: No, I don't know. We know. Well, then you tell me. - Who's your boss? - Altman. Altman, Ernest Altman, well, if he didn't fucking tell you what was on that disk, why should we trust you? He's asking himself the same question. Is that true, Brill? Are you asking yourself that same question right now? Yeah, I'm asking myself the same question. What is this? A comedy of errors? Look, why don't you guys come in with me. I can protect you. You've got some spending money, right? I call a fund. I'll take some of that. I tell you what. I'll trade with you. I trust you. Just don't hurt yourself. I'll send you the receipts. They linked Dodd to me. They figured out my real name. And that's how they got linked up to me. Thanks a lot, partner. They're moving fast. Too fast. Too fucking fast. [MUSIC PLAYING] AGENT: You lost more men that day than I did at Thorn's house. I'm right handed. We know. You got any sugar? I'll walk around the block and-- check the perimeter. There were complications. In the service, when things got tense, do something routine to feel normal. I need a shower. Did you get the plates off the vehicle? No. [CAR APPROACHING] Jennifer works with us. [MUSIC PLAYING] Tony, you think you can handle this part? Bring him in, now. Who's Angela? My wife. She died in a car accident. We were coming back from our cabin. I was leaving for the Middle East. And I wanted her to do something special. She took my stash away from me earlier that night. I was having trouble staying awake. I was addicted to cocaine. I needed it. [CRASH] [GASPING] PAUL: That was three years ago. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] James, what are we working on? We aren't working on anything. I'm working a data mining algorithm. I need a little information on an asset. Go through channels. File a work order. Have Mr. Altman approve it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL RINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] First name, Jennifer. European? Asian. Known associates. Currently in country. Karl Kim. In Korean, Karl means knife. Very impressive, James. He's not ours. He's not KCIA. Got him. Bring up Altman. This could be considered treason. Not if he committed treason first. Cross check. We paid Karl Kim for Operation Tracer from April 13 to April 20. Altman signed an invoice that week for miscellaneous equipment. And the defense contract people were killed on the 20th. Erase any sign that we were here. Done before you ask. You're good for it, James. Ah. What's the matter. He has a concussion. I'm sorry. Here. - Thank you. You're welcome. Well, if I was tied up for three hours, I wouldn't be so nice. I tried to shoot off his foot. Oh, that's good. That's all right then. I'm reassigning you. Karl Kim. What is he? Chinese Intel? Korean? Just like the good old days. The old times were bad times. [KNOCKING] CHARLES: Stacia. - Charles? Charles? What the hell is he doing here? [KNOCKING] [GUN SHOT] Ow. Damn. You have the disk. I know what he wants with the disk. But what does she mean to you. Just give them the god damn disk. The disk is over there. If you learn what it is, raise your free. If you deliver it, you'll be a national hero. Really. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOTS] AGENT POWERS [VOICEOVER]: So Karl Kim orders Jennifer to grab the ex-husband and bring the B team to bring the nurse's apartment. They're supposed to take out Thorn, Gentry and grab the disk. The score rises. Two dead enemy agents and the divorced nurse becomes the widowed nurse. Kim should have gone himself. AGENT: Jennifer Mi Yong, did she escape? Jennifer always escapes. AGENT: That's where you come back in. That's where I came back in. AGENT: Did you inform Brill of your intentions or whereabouts? Jeez, I left him a voicemail. Didn't he get that? Come on. Just a second. Yeah. Come on. That's enough. She's as good his Doc Reynolds. I killed that man. He was going to kill you. Then why do I feel like such shit, huh? Because you're a human being. What are you, huh? You're leaving? I'm going to Dodd's. If I'm not back in two hours, get in the car. Yeah, we're supposed to displace everything. And then we have to go somewheres far, far away. No man, I'm gong with you. Shit. Do I get a vote? No. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [TV BLARING] [GUN COCKING] Daniel Dodd's home movies. This one's 4th of July, 2007. I just watched another one called our wedding. And you and Angela, you were great best man and maid of honor. Brill sent you. No. Brill didn't know you'd be here. I did. You killed a lot of our men, Paul. Who are you? They killed my friend. Daniel Dodd. And then what? I guess that's supposed to maybe make us even. Dodd was going to meet a man named Fazli. OK. And I know where Fazli is. That dumb son of a bitch left is 20 on Dodd's cell phone. Where is he? I don't know who you were, and I don't know who you are, but right now, I've got a feeling you're just about the only person I can trust around here. Let me hear the message. Well, then, why don't you tell me what's on the disk? Well, maybe Fazli will tell us both. Call me stupid, but I'm going to give this back to you. And when I do, you put it away, all right? Go. AGENT: So you had Thorn at gunpoint? Yeah. And I could have dropped him. I could have grabbed the disk and brought it to you. And you would have been a good little soldier and given it to Altman. And Altman would have given it to the North Koreans, just like he did. Only difference is Thorn would be dead. AGENT: And you wouldn't be in that chair. Karl Kim in that bitch killed 11 people at Archangel. We lost Dodd and eight more at Thorn's house, Arlo Gentry, another nine, four or five cops, a couple of civilians, and a fucking partridge in a pear tree. And you are blaming me? AGENT: The officers were killed after you released Thorn. Right. And shit runs downhill. Jesus. Do you ever leave anybody alive? He was a lookout for Karl Kim, North Korean special forces. He killed those people at Archangel. Some fucks. Who ordered this? Altman. Who else? Look, you know, if you just tell me what this package is, Brill and I would be able to ID the client. Ask Fazli. I'm going shopping. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. Do something normal. That's what we used to do we when we got tense. You know, that's what we do. I used to drink. I'm buying. You just got cash, right? Yep. All right, can I borrow a dollar? See I got to stay alive till Wednesday now. [ELECTRIC BUZZING] AGENT POWERS [VOICEOVER]: She buys her stuff with a credit card. Altman's got her flagged. Karl Kim lands a block and a half from their hiding place. From there it was easy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Waiting till he's praying. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Don't. Of course not. There's been too much death already. I don't know who the buyer was. Geraldine, did that was her task. Oh, Geraldine. The others. Look, I tried to get the schematic to the right people. Mr. Reynolds said I could trust Mr. Dodd. Doc Reynolds? Yes, our security chief. He was a medic in the military. He died at Archangel too. Now it's too late. They have it. No, they don't. You have it? Do you know what it is? Please. Destroy it. Be stronger than me. It is the only one. Do it now. We can't do that. He doesn't know who the client is. We have to witness Altman doing the exchange. - And him? - Pow. He built the weapon that killed a million people. Let's just draw a target on his back, follow him around, and kill whoever kills him. He's right about one thing, though. There's been so much death already. Gentlemen, what do we do now? Let's put him on a plane. To where? Need to know, asshole. As long as you're carrying that disk, this isn't over. Stay healthy. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] I-- I can't say it. My friends would get mad at me. Leave her alone, you fucking coward. [MUMBLING] ARLO: The old times, they were bad. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] MAN: Your style is your responsibility. One question, perhaps you use a [INAUDIBLE] like we did in the jungle. Where? [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. [GUN COCKS] Pentothal doesn't work on me. What is this? What do you think? [GRUNTING] It's cocaine. [GUN SHOT] Open your eyes. Wake up! Then everyone is very happy, you and me. You motherfucker. [GUN SHOTS] I waited for you, my old friend. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOTS] [SIRENS APPROACHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Drop your weapon. [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOTS] [GUN SHOTS] [PANTING] [GUN SHOTS] [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't know about you, but I'm hoping for either a boy or a girl. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BEEPING] You call this coffee? AGENT: What happened at the warehouse? I don't want to talk any more. AGENT: Tell me what happened at the warehouse. Take this off. This is so fucking stupid. Why am I sitting here? AGENT: What happened at the warehouse? You rigged the paperwork to say whatever you want it to say. You're a liar. And all that's left is finding the scapegoat. There's Thorn or me. And here I sit. You need a hospital. [SCREAMS] I've just been informed that a bureau agent escorted one Sameer Fazli through security at DIA and placed him on a plane for Bogota. Any idea who the agent might be? Ah, it doesn't matter. We intercepted Fazli. And he's headed for the federal pen where he will be spending a very long time-- if nothing happens to him. Am I done here? That's up to you, Tony. [MUSIC PLAYING] What is this? The stuff that bad dreams are made of. [LAUGHTER] Mr. Altman, have we been to heaven? Oh, I see. I'm really sorry about Dodd. You know, if it had been easy, the client wouldn't have thought it was a valuable. [LAUGHS] Get better. What is this? It doesn't make you happy. You think blood money makes me happy? [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DISTANT THUNDER] [MUSIC PLAYING] You know, ballistics matched the weapon you used against the cops with the victims at the Archangel Company. Let's see, you go to state prison, continue your physical therapy, stand trial, are found guilty, and are executed for killing four police officers and more than a dozen others. Or you come into the company. [RAINING] [MUSIC PLAYING] A gift. He works for you? Well, if they don't do what I tell them to, they're sleeper cells. Well, they do what you tell them to do, the field agents. God, it's peaceful, isn't it? No, they're still sleeper cells. You ordered me to kill Kim. Someday you'll order Brill to kill me. Tried that. Didn't take, did it? [COUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] BOY: Are you OK? Hm? Come here, child. What's your name? Huey. Nice to meet you. Is that real? Have you ever killed anyone with it? What do you think? No. I have killed many people with this gun. So guys prayed for life. And other guys prayed and cried. You know my answer? Yes. Hey, what do you want to be when you grow up? [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOTS] [SCREAMING] [GASPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [GUN SHOT] [GLASS SHATTERS] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [GUNFIRE] [SCREAMING] [MUSIC PLAYING] AGENT POWERS [VOICEOVER]: Altman gets Thorn to hit Karl Kim, but Thorn turns the tables and tells him. So Kim hits Altman in front of a hundred witnesses. I would have liked to have seen that. Afterwards, I hope you don't leave me here with the snakes. But if you do, I'll understand. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] What's your name? Selma. You care for him? A lot. Does he care for you? A lot less. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [MUSIC PLAYING] [METAL CLANKS] AGENT: What happened to Jennifer Mi Yong? Jennifer Mi Yong. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] I don't know what happened to her? Why do you ask? Looks like you're going to need this. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is a promotion. What's with you guys? [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] AGENT POWERS [ON PHONE]: Paul, Brill sent you a black envelope. He wants you back. Don't do it. [MUSIC PLAYING]
