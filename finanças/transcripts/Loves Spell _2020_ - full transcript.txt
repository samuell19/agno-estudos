So, it's time for me to stretch and leave, actually. Alright. Listen, um, how often do you train down here? Often enough. So then maybe like we could train together, like... Um, I doubt that very much. I'm just gonna leave now. I've finished now. So if you want to take over, knock yourself out. Yeah, but... I'll see you later. Oh, man. Oh, God. Bruv, tell me that's you. - No, man. - That's gonna be you, bruv. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thank you so much for inviting us - to this amazing party. - No, you're welcome. Whoa! - So how many sets are we doing? - Probably about three more. - I feel mashed up rough, trust me. - Magical. Yo, what you're saying? You cool? - What are you saying, bruv? - He's saying cool. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I've seen you looking at that girl over. What, the one in the gray? Yeah, the one that was in the splits. Yes, she was good stuff. How do you know that she likes you though? That's what I'm trying to say. You are perving on a girl that's just trying to work out. And you don't even know she's your type. What's wrong with this guy? Or you're even her type. And I know for a fact you're not her type. Bruv, why... what's going on? What are you coming up... Bruv, I'm just saying, some people just want to work out, and you're out here trying to grab girls. Girls don't want you. She might not want to talk to you. She might not like you one bit, bruv. She's young. You're old. You're just a whole different breed. Bruv, who come to the gym dressed like Venom. Get out of here, man. - That's easy, you know. - Leave this brother alone, man. It's that people work out, man. Francis, you're still here. Hey, how are you doing? - I'm fine, thanks. - Good, good. Listen, I know we got off to a bad start, yeah, but maybe like we could train together or something. Look, we both know you couldn't keep up with me if you trained with me, so let's just leave it there. Wow. That's big talk. Alright, alright. What about this then... One day, when you're not working, yeah, if like I come over... Oh, no, you come over and we get some food. That... that's never gonna happen. And I can cook... Babes, who is this? You remember the client I was telling you about, the one that's renovating the old boxing gym. Yeah, listen, didn't she tell you about me? Like, I'm a client and basically... you told him... Did you tell him? You never said to him anything about like I'm... So basically, I buy and sell properties and she's... you know what she does, that's your girl, innit? Obviously. And, um, do you... You train here as well? - Does he train here? - Look, about the renovation, I'll be speaking to you soon about it. So, um, I'll see you later. Okay, alright. Well, it was good to see you. And I will be in contact regarding the... the property. Hello. Yeah. Ash, what's up? No, no, just on my way back from the office. What? Why are you reading my messages, bruv?

Do I know you from somewhere? Hold on, you're her. Yeah. You took my number and you didn't use it. - No, no, no, no. - It's okay, though. Listen, no, what happened... It's fine. It's fine. You're in pain. Okay, should I call the police, ambulance or... No, no, no police. It's okay. It's alright, I'll... I'll call my friend. - It's alright. - Did they hurt you anywhere else? - Did they cut you anywhere? - No. Oh, my phone's not working. You can use my phone, right? Shit, I've left it at home. So, look, I live around the block, right, so you can just come around the block with me at my house and you can just use my phone there. - Are you sure? - Use the phone at home. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure... - Yeah, but you don't even know me. Marvin's there. It's fine. It's okay. - Just gotta get you cleaned up. Yeah? - You sure? Yeah, yeah, sure. Come, let's just go. - Can you... - Yeah.

Okay, so my name is Shenisha. Um, and you can call me Shen. Nice to meet you, my name's Treyvon. - Ah. - Hello. Hi, Treyvon. That's it, Treyvon? Yeah. - I'll go and get a drink for you and... - Thank you. - Get some water for your face. - Thank you. I can't believe I'm inside her house here with her and she's touching my face. I don't let no girl touch my face. Look at her eyes. I think she's perfect. Oh, and she's got dimples as well. I didn't even realize she had dimples. This is just getting better. When you make a girl giggle like that, you're in. - Is it? - January 7th. Yeah, yeah. I got you. Oh, that must be your friend. Let me go and get him first. Oh, what happened to you? Bruv, some madness, bruv. So you know I went to go and meet, um, my friend, yeah, and I'm waiting in my car, within five minutes about seven or... There's at least ten of them actually. Men just surrounded my car, bruv. - What? - Yeah. There was enough of them to surround my car. I heard the man talking about he's gonna pull out a metal pipe and all that crap. So I jumped out and I confronted them. No, no, you know what I'm like. But why didn't you call me sooner? Bruv, I wish. I didn't have time. I jumped out. I'm grappling with two of them, punched one of them in the head. I know I broke his nose. I broke one of their... Look at my hand. - Yeah, he broke his arm. - Listen, yeah, so anyway, bruv, I appreciate you coming, man. Thanks, man. Thank you, bruv. I appreciate it, man. - Yeah, nice meeting you. - Very nice meeting you. - You take care of him. Yeah. - Nice to...

I would have been there in a flash. You know I'm about this thing. Bro, you should have called me. Bruv, who do you think I would have called? I would have called you, yes. Mr. Shadow Boxer over there, you're mad. I mean it. Who guess it? Um, I think it's yours, yeah. Bruv, I need to find this girl, you know. She helped me, bro. I need to see her again. - Your phone's smashed, innit? - Exactly. Yeah, I left her my business card but I don't know if she's even gonna call though. Don't you know where she lives? I went to her house last night but it was dark. So I don't even know if I remember. You do remember. Go there right now. Who turns up at a girl's house like they don't know? Like, this is the... I only met her once, you know. It doesn't matter. - Really? - Yeah, I'll do it 100 percent. Yeah, he would. This guy. You're a joker. Now, where is it? Where is it? Yeah, that is it. Who are you? What do you want? Who are you here for? And the rose flowers for? Are they for Shenisha? Shenisha. Who is Sheni... No, I don't know any Shenisha. - Is that who lives here? - Shenisha lives here. Oh, this is... No, this is 67 I was looking for. These flowers, Sister Margaret. I was looking for Sister Margaret. That's... yeah, because yeah... No, she lives at 67. She's... she's sick. She's sick. I brought them for poor Sister Margaret. Poor Sister Margaret, she is dying. Sister Margaret! Sister Margaret! She's not in. Hey, don't be doing that nonsense crap. Tiny. - Hey, Treyvon? - Hello, Shen love. Get back to bed. Get to the bed. Look, do you wanna go in? I've done most of the packing already but the heavy stuff is upstairs. - Okay. - I'm sure Marvin will be happy to see you. Alright. I've got an appointment later, alright. - Okay. Alright. - I'm working late. - Tiny? - Yeah. Ain't nothing tiny about him. He looks like he's been stung by a thousand bees and he's allergic to it. Anyway, um, yeah, um, these are for you. Oh, thank you. That's kind of you. You know, you didn't have to but I was just doing my friendly neighborhood bit and everything. - Yeah. - But, yeah, and I hate bullies, by the way, so. - Are you moving? - Yeah, well, kinda. No, yeah, I am, yeah, my tenancy agreement is finished so I've got to go. But, listen, I'd love to speak to you but I've got an appointment and I've got to go. Okay. Yeah, but look, I was just gonna ask, um, can I maybe take you out to dinner, lunch, coffee maybe? A date? Listen, that's so sweet but I've got a date already tonight, so. - Oh, you got... - Yeah, with my kids. You've got a kid? Well, five of them. - Five? - Yeah. But, listen, I've got to go. Hi, guys. - Hey, Miss. - You alright? Yeah, I'm good, thanks. Guys, continue doing what you're doing, okay? I'm going to make a quick phone call and I'm going to be back, alright? - Alright, Miss. - Okay. Please leave a message after the tone. Hi. Hi, it's Shenisha. Okay, yeah, um, so I'm doing evening courses in photography, right, and, um, this week, we're shooting in London locations and I was kind of like thinking if you would like to join me and, perhaps, we can go for a bite to eat after. So 8:00 AM tomorrow morning, Tate Modern. Okay, yeah, bye. ♪ You are my everything ♪ ♪ You are my one and only ♪ ♪ Ooh-hoo ♪ Ha-ha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can't a man be happy or what? Bro, happy is good but it's 6:00 AM in the morning and I want to take a piss. No one's this happy, this early in the morning. Well, I am. So, if you'll excuse me, I need to get ready. ♪ You are my everything ♪ Hi, so you came. - I told you. You alright? - How you doing? You alright? - Come, let's go this way. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. - Alright. - I love mornings like this. - Yeah. You know, especially, in the wintertime when it's nice and cold, calm and it's still. It's a bit too cold for me. Yeah. What do you do anyway? Um, yeah, I'm into property. - Property. - Yeah. I wish I did something like that, especially the fact that I'm nearly going to be homeless. Oh, don't say that. What do you do anyway? I work with children in the community, yeah. So I try to keep them off the streets. Oh, the five kids. - Yeah. - Makes sense now. Yep, it sure does make sense. Yeah. But I don't know for how much longer though. Why? What do you mean? Ah, never mind. Look, let's go. I've got a couple more spots to hit. Oh, okay then. Where would you like to go today, sweet? Oh, I've got a list to make it easier. Thank you. - That's no problem. - Cheers. You want to go to Albert Bridge, Trafalgar Square, Hampstead Heath and Buckingham Palace... Yeah, but can we stop off also at, um, Hyde Park as well, please? - That's no problem, sweet. - Thank you. You want to go to five different destinations? Yeah. Brother, could you just take us to Buckingham Palace, please? That's no problem, fella. Thank you. - So what about that? That's nice, innit? - That's Hyde Park. A mini Hyde Park. This actually this... this area is really nice. What is this area? And so that concludes the presentation, ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions you'd like to ask, please feel free. Uh, yeah, um, why is it so thin? What? Well, I mean, you want me to invest 300 grand in something this thin? Yeah. It's a fair point there, actually. Uh, maybe I can bulk it out with some of those traffic management studies. So, what do you reckon? I think if I had 300 grand, I'll be definitely in. To get 300 grand, you've got to get a job in the first place. Hmm, fair point. Come on, give me two. So, Miss, are we really gonna lose this place? Don't worry. It's gonna be fine, alright? - Where are we gonna train? - Don't worry. You don't have to worry about anything. It's gonna be fine. Yeah, right. Oh, really? Give me ten. - That's light. - It's light? Okay, how about give me 50 then? Yeah, exactly. I'll be back in a sec. So, how's... how's the deal going, bro? Yeah, it's kind of right, you know. Um, should be done in about three weeks, the contract. Nice. So, is she the one then? - Who? - Really, bro? You ain't stop talking about her. Come on. Oh, yeah. No. Bruv, I don't know, man, like, this girl... she's leaving anyway. Yeah, but where's she going? Don't know, bruv, but she's moving. Well, wherever she's going, I'm sure they've got mobile phones. Come on. Yeah, true, but I'm not sure, man. Like, you know the worst thing? I was actually gonna call her, you know, and ask her on a date. Do it like the traditional way. Well, just ring her, innit? Nah, bro. No way. What's the worst that can happen? Just call her. You serious? Ring her, bro. Ah, bruv! This guy, you know. - Come on, man. - This guy! Bruv, if this girl asked me, you know. Ah... Hello, babe. Yeah, um, listen. Um, ah, um. Yeah, I was just gonna ask, um, if you wanted to go out maybe to get something to eat later? Yeah. Oh, you got an appointment. What about after? Seven?

This girl's always got appointments though, bro. Well, she's a woman. You know what women are like, man. - Always waxing, do their head, their nails... - Yeah, true. - Make sure everything's prim and proper. - Yeah. Actually talking about all that business, man. I ain't goin' anywhere in a week or so, innit? What? I gotta go and do that whole, down on one knee thing, you know... Oh, yeah. - I forgot about that, you know, bruv. - Yeah, man. No, you know, I'm proud of you, you know. - You're proud of me? - Yeah, bruv. I'm proud of you, man. Trust me, more black guys need to do the same thing, you know. You know how many white guys get married at 17, 18. Black guys waiting till they're old, bald, looking terrible, belly hanging over their shirt. Yeah, bruv. Yeah, man. I'm happy for you, bro. Is this like some kind of bromance been going on? Bro, forget bromance, bro. Take the "mance" out of it, bro. We're just bros. - Let's roll, man. - Come, you ready? - Yeah, man. Come on, let's roll. - Let's roll, man. Let's roll. That is the one, innit? I can tell. You're doing this weird thing with your eyes when you're like twitchy and stuff. Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about. Babe, you haven't done that twitchy thing since you were at college. Mmm. Go on then, there's a picture. Okay, look at this. What? You don't know him, do you? Babe, he's black, sexy and hot. No. My type's white, the odd spawn. This guy's definitely not into Dr. Who. I do recognize him though. Looks familiar. You know, I got that T'Challa memory, babe. - Mm-hmmm. - Anyway, I think we should arrange an Avengers evening. - Yeah? - I guess that would be fantastic, yeah. - Get some noodles. - Yeah. - Get some wine before you leave. - I'm so down for that.

You know, but... yeah, it was just, you know, just dating and stuff. - So, it was just sweet. - Dating? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. - The old eye thing. - It's all twitchy. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. A hundred and seven messages! Who needs online dating? So, Marvin, I've got this date tonight, right? And I kind of really like him. I don't know what dress to wear. What dress can I wear? I'm thinking of the red one, or the black one. As a matter of fact, which one do you think? This one, or this one? But, tonight, listen, when he comes right, you've got to be really good to him. You've got to be a really good boy, okay? Don't jump up on him. Don't slobber him with kisses or anything like that, no hugs, alright? Did you get me? Okay. So, you gonna be a good boy?

Like there's thousands of Ubers, I don't understand. Don't worry, don't worry. Look, there's a cab station around the corner, I'll just get us a car, alright? Two secs. Hi, um, can I have a car, please? Yeah. Two hours? Right. Okay. Are you sure? I mean, like I just... - What? - Just put the phone down on me. What? Oh, my gosh. What a day? What a week? What a life?

Where's Marvin? - He's at my cousin's house. Look, don't worry about it. We'll just get a takeaway or something. What, you don't trust my cooking? Yeah, I do. I just don't want you to put too much pressure on your ankle. - That's all. - Oh, thank you. I'll tell you what then. You order the food and I will see what's in the television. Can you pass me the control, please? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Ooh. - There you go. Um, just order anything? Yeah, but I don't eat seafood because I'm allergic to it. Okay.

Never turned up. Well, that's what I'm saying. I've got him on them apps, nothing. Apps? Oh, my God! We sat there one night in my living room, he was on Grindr, right? And I couldn't... Sorry. No. That's my app. He was on Tinder and we sat there for ages. All he kept on doing was swiping left, right, left, right. No matches at all. He is the worst person, honestly. Useless, man. Honestly. What are you doing with that banana? You're gonna eat it or what? Here. Thank you. Okay. Right. Now, that will be about 20 minutes. What's on Netflix? I don't know because this remote control is just not working. - Alright. - I don't know what's going on. Alright. Calm down. Bloody hell. Listen, it's alright. Listen, we can go old school like and have a conversation. Relax. Or, even better if we have a look at some old photographs. That'll be fun. What do you mean? Like an old album and stuff? Like of... of me... of my work? Of you, obviously. Like, you know, the old school photographs, you know. The ones when you had like your afro and your flares and your little picky head and... Those got destroyed years ago in Haiti. Oh, whatever. Okay, okay. - Alright. - Mm-hmm. Actually, who are they? That's my grandparents and... Yeah. Nice. And who's that down there? That's my mom and that's my mom, too. Yeah, and that mask there my dad made that for my... Well, for me and my mom just after she died. Oh, very interesting. It's different, I can tell you that. Yeah, my mom was very interesting. She was a bit weird, you know. She was into all that magic stuff and everything. Well, like voodoo and juju business? Yeah, whatever you want to call it. Like two days after my 19th birthday, she passed away and yeah, my dad told me that she wrote a letter, but so slow, he passed away before he could tell me where the actual letter was so... Oh, wow. I'm sorry to hear that. But anyway, um, do you want something to drink? What do you fancy? Uh, anything really. - Whatever you're having. Anything. - Okay. So, vodka with lemonade? - Yeah, that's alright. Yeah, yeah. - Cool. What? How long for the food? Oh, it should be here in a minute. Should I get that? Yeah, go on. Go ahead. I'm coming. I'm just getting changed. - What's this? - The... the... the... the... This... this... this is just mm... mm... mm... my... my system. You're Mr. T Pa... This is 65. Yeah, but I didn't order pizza. But... you done on... on... on online. Bruv, I ordered Thai. I didn't order pizza. But I... I... I got a d... date. At eight. - The... the... the... the... - Oh, my Lord! T... t... tip. I know, I did not order pizza. It's fine. Let's just eat because I'm so hungry. Oh, and it's seafood. - Seafood? - Yeah. - I'm allergic to seafood. - I know. Okay, look. Let me get something from the kitchen. Yep, don't worry. Alright, can I wash my hands at least? Yeah, sure it's just down there. - That door just there. - Thanks, cheers. Alright. Oh! What happened? Oh, my goodness! Like what else can happen? Oh, shit! ...investing, you're gonna have to report. I know I'm late. You alright? You know, busy morning and everything. How you doing? Whatever. Why you always late? I just don't get it. Stop complaining. I'm here now, okay? What are you eating? - Get your own food. - Jeez! I understand this woman's prerogative in that but there's late and then there's late. What's wrong with you, man? Come on like you're not getting enough bum at home. Oh, like really? Did you really need to even say that? Jeez! Talking about that, Shen, how was last night? Don't even go there. Honestly, behave yourself. Look, I've just decided that it's not about me and men, okay? It's about me and Marv. That's it. And he's the reason why you ain't getting no man. You see, man, this is exactly the reason why I can't deal with them. Exactly. Don't end up one of those like old biddies, you know. All lonely with your wrinkly cat... or dog. Hold on, ain't that... - So, I think he... - Oh, that's Aunty Vanessa. Aunty Vanessa, Vanessa. - No. - You got a white auntie? She's Jewish for goodness sake. Ah, that's like Vanessa Fitzsimmon always man bashing. - Hold on, ain't she like that... like relationship guru? - Yes. Maybe we should speak to her. What? Like what? About my man problems? - I think you should go to ask her. - No, no, no. - If you won't. I will. - No. No, no, no. No, No. No. Um, hi. - Hello. - Excuse me. Hi, Ms. Feltz. - Hi. - Hi, my name is Shaz. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - This is my friend Shen. - Hello. - Hi there. - Hi, pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet. This is Ben. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi, Nice to meet. - Hi. - Hi. Pleased to meet you. - Hello. Nice to meet you. Sorry, do you mind if I get a selfie? Sure, pleasure. - I'll do it later. - Alright, fine. So, like this is my friend Shen. She's basically been single forever like as in cobweb single. - Oh! - And, um, I know that you guys have been together for some time now and I just wanted to know if you could give us some advice on like what the secret is. Well, what I would say... Well, it's... it's really very much like this. Well, I think the situation is this. What you want is to cultivate a relationship with someone very different from yourself. You've got nothing in common, whatsoever. - Different background, different culture... - Yeah, but... ...social class, everything completely different, income, everything different. So, you have nothing to talk about at all. Absolutely nothing 'cause you got nothing in common. Then you rev up the chemical side - and you get that whole carnal side. - Yeah, but... Now, if you unleash, you know, that element in you that may be dormant for all these years. - And so, for example, just for example, randomly... - Yeah. ...you're doing something really ordinary - like let's say cleaning your teeth, okay? - No, but that doesn't always... But you have the option of just cleaning your teeth. You're like someone in a toothpaste ad. Okay, so you could be doing it like this. - Yeah, but don't forget... - No, but you could instead... really, you know. You get the toothpaste, you just squirt it on. Kind of like erupt onto the toothbrush and at the moment, you're just, you know, and it's... - Yeah, but what if... - You squirt the tooth... You remember when I did it, it was only yesterday for God's sake. Let's say you're putting on lipstick. You don't just do that, but instead you, you know, just around there. Just like... like that and then that way you've got this simmering sexual tension and you've got the whole thing going on. And, you know, and it can... You can transcend it into anything you would normally do. - Yeah. - That type of thing. So, what do you think, Ben? Whatever she said. Right. Yeah, bruv. It's just mad. I don't know what's going on. I swear to you, it's like I'm cursed. It's like... I don't know. I'm serious. There's something wrong. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. What do you mean? Did you ask her on a date? I didn't even get that far. That's what I'm trying to say to you. It's... bro, I don't know what's going on. I really don't, man. It's just crazy. I've invited her over later on, so I'm just hoping that everything goes alright tonight. I'm sure it will, bruv. What about Clara, though? When are you gonna see Clara next? Oh, yeah. No, I've got an appointment with her in a few days. Oh, nice. Cool. Yeah, so that should be fine. - Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool. - Yeah, okay. Yeah, man.

Oh, my God! - Uh, do you want to take a seat? - Yeah. Alright. Oh, my Lord! No way. Is everything alright? Huh? Yeah, everything's fine. Oh, my God! Oh! What's going on? Are you sure everything's okay? Oh, man! Oh, wow! Okay, so I guess it's takeaway then, yeah? And this time, I'm ordering. Oh, God! It's so cold out here, but you know what? It's better being out here than the inside with all that smoke and your three-course meal. Funny. Real funny. - But it's true, right? Yeah. - Oh, leave me alone, man. - But I'm right. - Yeah. Do you know what? I know it sounds weird yeah, but I just can't believe you're here. Like you're actually here in my house. Like, I just feel like the luckiest guy ever. I know it sounds weird. I know. I know you think like I'm just maybe just talking, but I mean it. It's... it's just... it's crazy. But talking about compliments and stuff, like what do you see in your ideal woman? - My ideal woman? - Mm-hmm. Natural, slick brown hair, red lipstick, - furry coat, black dress, nice teeth. - Oh, you're funny. You're too much. You're absolutely too much. No. I just don't understand why you're single. Like, you're gorgeous. Look at you. Look! That moonlight's nice, right? Not as beautiful as you. Look, this ain't what I had in mind. I promise you, I can cook. No, thanks, no. Uh-uh. What, a limp lettuce leaf is in your finger? - I'm sorry. - It's alright. - What about some wine? - Hmm. Cheers. - Alright, cheers. Well, yeah. - It looks very nice, anyway. - Yeah, I did try. - You did. You did. Oh, man! It's bad. - Do you dance? - I do, actually. - Can you? - Yeah. Do you have anything I can change into? Huh. Yeah, I've got a dressing gown in the bathroom. Thanks. Shenisha. Shenisha. Yo, Ash. Ash, have you seen Shenisha? Huh? Been on a bender, mate. Just got back. Bro, do you believe in duppy? In what? Ghosts, spooks, evil shit. You mean like Count Dracula or Frankenstein? Bro, I'm not even joking. I think a ghost lives here. So, is he more like Casper or is he Freddy Krueger-ish? - I'm serious. - So am I. That shit keeps moving by itself. Look, there's no such thing as ghosts. There's a logical explanation for everything. And on that note, I'm going back to sleep. I've been up all night. Logical explanation, I'm knackered. Later, mate. Oh! Come in. - Hello. - Hi. - You okay? - Yeah, it's nice to see you. Ah, good. So, how are you? Yeah, um, not bad. Listen, you know the girl you's talking to outside, is that your friend or a client? - Phishing, yeah? - What? Phishing, when you're trying to find that information. She's not my friend, she's a client. Client? Anyway, how's your quest for love? No, it's alright. Yeah, still single. Still looking. Okay, well, I think today's session is going to be about role play. - Role play? - Yes, you know, I need you to imagine... It's not hard... you know, me, sexy woman in a club, alright? Just a feisty woman in a club. I need to see how you would come for all of this and try to get all of this. - I got to do it, really? - All of this. Do you want to stay single, huh? - Okay, alright. - Come for me. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. Okay. Alright. Ah! Oh. Oh, God! God, I hate packing. Shit! Hey, Claire. Hiya. Yeah. Um, look, I need to ask you to do me a favor, please, if possible. Yeah. Would you look into a company called Skyline Properties for me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Skyline Properties. Thanks, doll. Yeah, bye. Bye. Who wants their nails done first? Oh, go on. I'll give it a go. Which color do you want? I'd go with pink, but you know what they say, pink makes the boys wink. Hey. Yeah, yeah. Everyone's here. Yeah, what is it? What is it? Alright. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Bye. - Claire? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's on her way. Oh, well. I don't know. If you ask me, I would say all men cheat. - They just can't help it. - Mm-hmm. It's in their makeup. If a woman's going to offer them the pom-pom, they're going to take it. Oh, no. Not my Byron. He's not cheated on me before. Not that you know about. Piss off! So, what's next for the evening, ladies? What's next? - Drinks. - Yeah, cheers to that. That sounds good. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, cheers to that. - Chin-chin. - Mmm, this drink tastes good. God, I so needed that. - So, what did you find? - Oh, hi, Claire. Yes, I'm fine. Thanks for asking. Yes, thank you very much. Yes. Okay. Hi, how are you doing? Okay, so what did you find? Where's Marvin? He's not here. He's at my cousin's house. - Come on, what did you find? - Oh, hi, ladies. Alright? - Hey, Claire. - Hiya! Nice. Okay, you know I said that I recognized this guy from somewhere. - Yeah. - Boom! What is it? I knew it would come to me. I went through all my old albums and I found him. Who are they? - Oh, you don't want to know, babe. Man, there's more. - There's more. Shit. Well, yeah. So, I did some digging on your mystery developer and he's none other than Skyline Developers, which they've just put in an application to build flats on your gym, babe. What? Now, Companies Houses lists Skyline Developers as Treyvon Patterson, and Treyvon Patterson on LinkedIn's profile says that he used to go to Woodhill College with us. You recognize him now? Yes, babe. It's Treyvon Patterson, Treyvon. It's your Trey. I hate him. What do you mean you hate him? How... how can you hate him when you just... - Oh, shit! - ...when you used to like him and now... what? I mean that's even geeky for me, Mavis. - Mavis? - Who? So, your name's Mavis? Can someone tell me what's going on? Oh, shit! Look, she's having a moment, alright? Look. That was then. This is now, okay? Look, you... you... you're stunning. You're an absolute babe. - Ain't she, ladies? - Yeah. - Yes. - Yeah, you're lovely, Shen. No, but it's not what's on the outside, it's what's on the inside. You don't even understand. Claire, do you know that I'm still going to counseling? Counseling? Would you just please, just shut up. Babe, I'm actually glad that I'm moving because I don't think I want to see him again. This was like 19, 20 years ago, babe. Yeah, he's done wrong, but I haven't seen that eye quiver since you were at college. Yeah, she's right. What about the gym? What about those kids? Babe, it's just business. Look, let's get this Avengers on the road, okay? Because I brought my onesie and my hammer. Bugsy Captain America. - Iron Woman. - Yes... oh, babe. This is my tune. Get in. Yes! What? What is that? Oh, excuse me. Do you know how to get to Central Park? Wait, wait. Hold on. Wait. Ain't you from here? - You trying to get us lost? - I'm not from here. This is Brooklyn. North Train Avenue is two blocks south. Take the C-Train and you'll find it. - C-Train? - Yeah. - Awesome. - Okay. - Thanks. - Thanks, mate. - Cool accent. - Oh, thanks, bro. Oh, God! - Do you remember this tree? - Of course, I remember that tree. No, do you remember this tree? - Of course, I do. - Go on then. Well, we had our first picnic here and... - Yeah. - ...we, uh... You... you definitely remember this tree. So, alright look, um, we've been together like three years and... - Four. - Four? - Yeah, four. Four years. - Four? We've been together four years, five months, three days and two and a half hours. Wow! Brah. Anyway, look, I've been thinking... Really? Go on, answer it already. Hello. Trey. Trey, Trey. I'm in the middle of... What? Come on, bruv. No, I'm just about to do my down on one knee thing, man. What? Bro, bro. Just handle your business, bro, like I'm handling mine. No. Bye, Trey. Bye, Trey. Sorry. Alright, so... Oh, my God! Will you marry me? Yeah, of course. - Would you really marry me? - Yes! - Will you marry me, marry me, marry me, marry me? - Yeah. Ai! It's just beautiful. - We're getting married. - Yeah! Bro, listen. You need to kiss her, hug her, make her feel like she's the one, bro. Trust me, man. Do it like your life depended on it. She's the one. She's the one. She's the one. Good morning. Mum, what you doing here? What? You're not going to invite us in? I need to go. This is Myrtle, one of the young ladies I told you about you. The one at the church. - Would you like a drink, Myrtle? - Yes, please. She'll have juice. Any juice will do. And I'll have a cup of tea and in it. That's good too. Come on, Myrtle. "And when he went out, hence..." You got the Bible on your phone. You do know it's the 21st century, don't you, son? It has to keep up with the times, you know. You can't walk around with the paper version all the time. "...in the synagogue, and many hearing Him were astonished." "Saying from henceforth this man, these things I tell you the word, powerful." Would you like to read the next chapter, son? Oh, do you know what? I really want to go to the toilet, mom. - Toilet? - Yeah. - Now? - I'm bursting. Like I'm... like my bladder is full. Hmm, too much information. I'm sorry. I'll be back in a minute. - You have to go now? - Yeah. I'll be back in a minute. My kid. He'll soon come back, yeah. I think his belly's a bit delicate. Mm-hmm. Hey, Shenisha. Go away, Treyvon. Why? What have I done? I just want to talk. I've got nothing to say to you. What? Alright, look. I'm sorry. I don't... I don't even know what I'm saying sorry for. Can you open the door? Why would you want to talk to me, anyway? What? I'm ugly, remember? What are you talking about? You're gorgeous. I've told you this. Just open the door. Just open the door. Shenisha. Why have you got a picture of me when I was younger? And, uh, ugly Mavis? Who's this? Is it... is it your sister? - No, it's me, Treyvon. - What? - I don't understand. - You know what, just delete my number. I just don't exist anymore, alright? Just, just go away. Shenisha. Why? The kids, the gym, just like why. Oh, man. It's just business. I'm a property developer, that's what I do. That gym's been derelict for decades. Just leave me alone. Okay, look, can you just give me five minutes? But if you just let me in for five minutes, I can explain everything. Please. Hold on. Wait. Where's Marvin? Marvin's not here. If he was here, you'd be minced meat. Look, I just want to talk. Please. Talk to me about what? So, you can lie to me? You know, you ruined my life. For all those years, I actually believed that I was ugly and I went to therapy for years and years and years. Yeah, well, look, you're gorgeous. Look at you. No, what you see is strong and confident on the outside, but you have no idea what's going on in the inside. Look, alright. I know what I could do. - What if... hear me out. - Mm-hmm. What if I still serve the eviction notice. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait a second. - I knock down the building... - I knew this was a bad idea. ...build some flats - and then put a state-of-the-art gym underneath. - No, no, no. I think you need to leave. - Just go. - But that's alright. I said just go. Mummy! Who keeps their dead mom in the house? What's this? "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. He who caused you pain must call you gorgeous three times or remain without someone to love or hold, without someone to call their own. Six weeks, six days, six hours will pass. The most your love will ever last until the time true love you see, your lonely fate I thus decree." - What is... - Hold on. She's talking about me. Someone to love. Someone to hold. Someone to call their own. That's me. Hold up. Your mom put juju on me. That's it. - Oh, Oh, shit. - Treyvon, this isn't about you. No, you're right. It's about us. It's about you not letting people judge you by what you look like and understanding that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And it's about me understanding that I shouldn't just judge people by what they look like on the outside, but what they're like on the inside. That's what it is. Can't you see? Look, look. Listen, I'll just do anything to make this work. Just... just let me know what I need to do. - I don't... I don't know. - Forget the flats. I'm... I'm not going to knock down the building. I won't bother with that. Forget about the flats. I'll just refurbish the gym and that's it. I'll just spend the money there. - What, you'd do that for me? - Yeah. No, I'll do it for us. What's up with your eye? And for her. Like, I don't want to go on the wrong side of her. No, no, no, no. Not over mommy. Yeah, I know, bro. It just didn't work out, man. I know that's life, mate. I thought so, too. No, come on, bruv. Of course, I'm gonna be there. I'm the best man at your wedding. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Alright. Take care. Alright. Bye. - Everything alright? - Yeah, it is now. Mm-hmm. Yeah, just Jirese talking about the finance on that new deal I was doing. - Alright. Okay. - You okay? I'm good. Ashley! Asher! - Broski! - Listen, bro. Quick one. Set. Action. Sir, we can't hear action at all out there. Action. - You'd do that for me? - Yeah, I'll do it for us. And her. What's up with your eye? I won't bother building the flats. How about that? I'll just refurbish the gym and just make it brand-new. - You'd do that for me? - Yeah. The eye is incredible. Yeah, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's broke. Let's do it again. And for her. Like, I don't want to get on the wrong side of her. Oh, you stepped on mom. I guess I did. Sorry. Subtitles by explosiveskull
