(dog barking, birds chirping) (upbeat music) ♪ If this is all there is ♪ ♪ Don't wake me for the fight ♪ ♪ I'd rather be alone ♪ ♪ Asleep, not worry for a break tonight ♪ - Watch where you're going, geek. I thought that I made it very clear that you're not cool enough to walk on my street. - It's my only way to my house. - That's not my problem, geek. You've got me to look forward to everyday, come on girls. (light music) - Allison, the patient in exam three is waiting on you. - Hey Landon, buddy, I know you're scared, okay? You know what, it's okay to be afraid. Sometimes even I get scared, but you wanna know what I do when I get scared? I take a big deep breath (inhaling) and I put my cool shades on. Do you wanna put some cool shades on? Now what you're afraid of, can't see that you're afraid. All right, it's your turn to be brave now. Dr Reese is gonna come in really soon and he's gonna look at your teeth, okay? All right, high five. (hands slapping) All right, I'm gonna be just around the corner if you need me, okay? - Hey Landon, are you ready? - Excuse me, Dr Ackers, sorry. (metal crashing) I am so sorry. - Allison, just bring me another tray. - I just finished sterilizing the instruments you threw on the floor, what is your problem? - Brian's birthday's today. - He is so cute, we should take him to that new restaurant around the corner. - Allison, you should come too. - Yeah, okay, thanks. - Really, why did you invite her? She is such a fat slob. - I didn't wanna be rude. - Erin. - Brian doesn't even like her. I can't wait until her internship is up. (dishes clinking) (background chattering) - Hey guys. - Hey, Allison. - Hey Allison, why don't you sit with me? - No, actually, I can't stay, I just wanted to bring this by and say happy birthday. - Thanks, Ali. - Well that's too bad. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah, see you guys. (melancholy music) - Okay, how to stay married and not kill anybody. Step number one, you've got to avoid bitterness and resentment. Now, bitterness and resentment can build when one person feels they are unfairly bearing the burden of the relationship. (footsteps walking) Then they will start to feel-- - [Kate] Hey lady, why are sittin' in the dark? - You didn't come home last night. - I spent the night at Donnie's. I thought you were going out tonight. - [Allison] Just didn't feel like it. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Didn't they invite you? - Just didn't fit in, I guess. - [Kate] That is not true, you know-- - I see all these beautiful, skinny people and they're happy, they're living their lives and I'm eating, watching a marriage seminar. Like that'll ever happen. - Allison, this is not healthy. You've gotta get up and live your life. - What life? It's pointless, look at me Kate, who is going to want me? - Ali, you are beautiful. My grandmother always says it's not what others see in us, but what we see in ourselves that makes us beautiful. - What, was your grandmother a greeting card writer? - No, but she had a life outside of takeout and TV. - Well, I see a very lonely life ahead of me, full of takeout and TV. But, I wouldn't feel so lonely if you came with me tomorrow night to young adults. - [Kate] I can't. - You always say that. - Yeah, but this time I mean it, I have a date. (light music) (background chattering) - Justin, shes' here. - She who? - The new hottie, the one I was telling you about. - So what, you go talk to her. - Steph would kill me. By the books, behind the fatty. - She is hot. - Chad. - What, I was just saying hi, she's for Justin. - Are we still going to Bedford's, I'm hungry. - Sure, I'll be right there. I'll invite Erin, see you there. - Stop. - Hey, a bunch of us are going to Bedford's, you all coming? - Yeah, sure. - All right, cool. - I saw that. - Dude, is she even coming? - I haven't seen her yet. - [Erin] Hey, you. - Here she comes. Hey Erin, have you met Justin? - It's nice to meet you. - You too. - Oh, better run, the old ball and chain is lonely, see ya. - So, Erin, right? - [Erin] Uh huh. - How long have you been coming to young adults? - I've only been a few times, but I'm really starting to like it. - Yeah, it's, it's pretty cool. - So you in school? - Yeah, I'm at state right now studying business. - Planning to run some big corporation? - [Justin] No, actually-- - I am so sorry. - What is wrong with you? - Erin, I'm really sorry. - If you would just lose some weight, maybe you wouldn't have such a hard time being normal. - Sorry. - You were a little hard on her, don't you think? - She has no idea how expensive this is. - Look, it was nice to meet you, I'll see you around. Hey, are you okay? I haven't talk to you in awhile. - Have we talked? - Look, I'm sorry about Erin, she's just-- - Beautiful. Look, can we just change the subject please? - Okay, I saw your internship is almost over. - How did you know that? - Found out on Instagram. - So you're stalking me? - What else is social media for though, right? - It's amazing how much we can know about each other without actually knowing each other. - I know, it's too bad you can't post real stuff though. You wanna kill your best friend, you worry about choosing the wrong path or are afraid to be alone. Or at least you shouldn't. - It's scary though, letting people see the real you. - Yeah, can I ask you an embarrassing question? - I think it is your turn to be embarrassed. - What do you think about those online dating sites? - Don't tell me that you can't find a date. - I'm just specific. - Are you on one of those dating sites? - Kind of, I've made the profile, but I haven't really looked at it. - Well, maybe you'll find someone. - Maybe, king me. - So, what are you doing this summer? - I usually volunteer at a kids camp, how bout you? - [Friend] Dude, we're late. - For? - Steph wanted us to go see this new place downtown and we're gonna be late. - But, um. - Come on. - Okay, apparently I made plans, but we'll talk again, I'm so sorry about this. What? (light suspenseful music) - What are you so busy working on? - Nothing. - Was that UNight, fat chance. - [Allison] I was just messing around. - Maybe you'll find someone. - Yeah, but he'll totally have a neck beard. - What's a neck beard? - It's where their beard tries to cover their fat neck. Nevermind. Seriously, who is going to want you. - [Woman] Erin! - No offense, I was just saying, then again, you may find a chubby chaser. (keyboard clicking) (door opening) - What up? Steph's goin' to some girls night thing, so we are free to prowl. - No, you need help and I have exams. - Only looking, no touchy, that would be wrong. - I don't even understand why she puts up with you. - We're not even that serious. - Dude, you've been dating for over a year. Your longest relationship before that was with Emily Walker. That was in the third grade for two weeks. - No, don't forget about Sarah, Sarah Wedley, four months. - Seventh grade, that doesn't count, she was overseas the whole time. - What's your point? - Don't you want a real relationship? - Like a wife? No. Your standards are too high. Yeah, I've seen your UNight profile. - What? - Oh yeah, Steph's friend, Megan, she found it. - I was just foolin' around. - Yeah, whatever, here, let me show you how to make a profile. Bam, there, that is a profile. - [Justin] Really? - Yeah, you gotta put your best foot forward. - It's not even your foot. - How do you know? - Likes long walks on the beach and watching romantic comedies. No. - Lest you be judged, my friend. Okay Fabio, let's take a look at yours. Looking for a serious relationship. Must be athletic, confident, intelligent, unmaterialistic, spontaneous, laid back, honest, independent, supportive. Dude. - Yeah, so? - Looking for hot and cool, it doesn't exist. - I didn't say anything about hot. - I saw it in your eyes. - Do you think about what you say before you say it? - Do you even think about what you're gonna say before you say it sometimes? - Attractive is important, but that's not the only thing I'm looking for. - Yeah, well, you can't have both, it's just not possible. Here's one, she's hot. - Passion for pediatric services, likes movies and music, fun and laid back, I really like this one. - And she's hot. - Yes, she is. - Send her a message. - I don't know. - Just say, Hi, you're hot, let's hangout, done. - It could be a 60 year old man in Iowa for all I know. - It could be, after all, you put that you like reading. - Shut up, I like reading, I just don't have time. You know that. - Just send her a message. - Fine, I'll think about it. Besides, I have to go. - Hello beautiful, come to Chad. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. All right, let's see who's out there. Hey there lovely lady, I like music too. We should go to a show sometime, hit me up, Kyle. All right, Kyle, let's see how you are. Ew. - What you doin'? - Just lookin' for the perfect someone. Delete. - What? Hey, good for you, let's see what you got. - Oh, no, no, huh uh. - No, okay, next. Oh, he's so old, how old is he? - Prehistoric. - Yeah, no, definitely not, okay. - Oh, he's cute. - Yeah, but we have nothing in common. No, next. No, no, no. (laughing) There is no way, no. Oh, this is so stupid, it's never gonna work. - No, there is somebody out there. - Yeah, I don't know. Hey, didn't you have a date tonight? - He canceled, he got called into work, but he's gonna text me if he gets off early. - That's a bummer. - Yeah, oh, maybe it's still on. It's grandma. - The greeting card writer. - She says she's praying for me, I love her. - This is such a bad idea. Dear Allison, Hi, my name is Justin. I hope this isn't forward, but it seems like we have a lot in common. I'm not sure how this whole thing works, but maybe we could get to know each other. I saw that you like movies, so let's start there. What's your favorite movie and why? I hope to hear from you soon, take care, Justin. - Did you say something? - Nope, nothing. (inspirational music) - Hey Allison, so did you sign up to help out at kids camp over the summer? - Camp? Me, yeah, I don't think so. - I signed up. - Girls need good mentors and I think you would be great. - Yeah, I really don't (upbeat music) You know, actually I've been looking for something to do this summer. (background chattering) Mind if I sit here? - Hey, you made it! - Hey Allison, what are you doing here? - My internship's up, so I thought I'd give back. - That's awesome, you're really gonna enjoy it. - Hey, I'm Nikki. - I'm Allison. - Is this your first time at Timberlake? - Yeah. - Yeah, this place is pretty amazing. - [Nancy] Hello everybody! - [Crowd] Hi. - Thank you so much for coming. I'm Nancy and I'm the director of Camp Timberlake! (cheering) We're gonna have an exciting summer and I am so thankful that we can come together and share God's love with these children. And why don't we start with a get to know you game. Does anybody know any get to know you games? - How about the name game? - Okay, great idea, why don't you start it? - All right, all right, hi everybody, I'm Electric Ethan. - [Crowd] Hi, Electric Ethan. - What's up guys, I'm Jumping Justin. - [Crowd] Hi, Jumping Justin. - Hi, I'm Alligator Allison. - [Crowd] Hi, Alligator Allison. - What's up, Alligator Allison? - That's gonna stick with me, isn't it? - [Justin] Absolutely. - Okay, well Jumping Justin, don't expect me to jump every time I see you. - It's kind of a requirement. Listening to any good music? - The best, country. - Yeah, I'm pretty sure I said good music. I might have to educate you on what that means. (light upbeat music) (knocking) - [Nancy] Come in. - I have the emergency contact cards all filled out. - Thank you, just put em down. Thank you so much for helping us. - Oh, you're welcome, I'm really happy to be here. - [Nancy] How do you know Justin? - Oh, Justin, from church. - Oh. - We're just friends, I'm not exactly his type. - What's his type? - Someone who doesn't look like me. - Well, I think he's twitterpated and I know him well. He's been here three summers, he's a great guy. Hey, lollipop? - Uh, no, thanks. - It's my diet program. - The lollipop diet? - Well, I realized that I was eating out of nervousness, so I switched to sunflower seeds and lollipops. Because whenever I crave sugar, I just lick a lollipop and it's only 40 calories and it lasts a long time. And then I realized that people, when they look at me, they don't see my body, they see me. - I'm sorry, I don't follow. - Well, like, maybe not strangers, you know, they might look at your outside, but like people who know me, they look at my soul. And, like my husband, he has like kind of big ears and he's not six feet tall, but when I see him, I see Superman because he's brave and protective and kind and smart and he reads the Bible when no one's looking. And you know, so I like his ears and his, you know, height because that's him. - Most people don't feel that way though. - When you realize how beautiful you are to the Lord, then you'll see what Justin sees. Oh, the kids are here. Hey, do you know the welcome song? ♪ We welcome you to Timberlake ♪ ♪ We welcome you to Timberlake ♪ ♪ We're mighty glad you're here ♪ (upbeat music) - Hey. - Hey, where are your girls? - Nikki took em on a nature walk. I doubt that'll last very long. - Awesome, yeah, we're headed to archery, so we'll see you later, Alligator Allison. - See ya. - More like Elephant Allison. - Hey, don't do that again, K? Go. (light music) (phone ringing) - Who's that, Allison? - He's a friend. - A boyfriend? - No, just a boy. I can't find any green ones. - Do you want him to be your boyfriend? - Well, I don't think that he wants to be my boyfriend. He's never seen me before. How did you find that green one so fast? - It was right there. Why hasn't he seen you? - Um, it's kind of complicated, we just text. - Does he not want to see you? - Um, yeah, he does, well, he thinks he does. - Grownups, they make a mess out of everything. - Sometimes we do. - Do you like him. - Yeah. - I think you should meet. - [Girl] Me too. - [All Girls] Yeah. - All right, we'll see, you little matchmakers. (ball bouncing) (background chattering) (phone vibrating) - Hey, Kate. - Hey, how's it goin? - Kate, what's wrong? - It's my grandma, they had to take her to the hospital. - What happened? - I'm not sure yet, but I'm getting ready to head there. - I'm so sorry, what can I do? - Please um, please pray. - Of course. - My mom's callin' me so I gotta go, but thanks for always bein' there, love you. - Yeah, I love you too. (clapping) (laughing) - [Justin] Hey, how's your day? - [Allison] Pretty good, yours? - [Justin] Good, just shootin' some hoops with some friends. - [Allison] Too funny, I'm watching a basketball game too. - [Justin] Great minds. I've got a question. - [Allison] Shoot. - [Justin] Can we video chat? I'd love to see a face with all this text. - [Allison] Now's not a good time. - [Justin] Oh, okay, maybe soon then? - [Allison] I don't know, maybe. And Lord, thank you so much for keeping us safe this week and for the new friends we've made. And Lord, thank you so much that we've been able to grow closer to you. In Jesus name I pray, Amen. - [Girls] Amen. - All right girls, 10 minutes til bedtime. - Ali? - [Allison] Mmhmm? - Can I ask you a question? - [Allison] Sure. - What do you want to be when you grow up? - Well, I'm studying to be a dental assistant. So I guess that's what I'll be. - Is that what you've always wanted to do? - No, not really, why do you ask? - I want to be an astronaut. - Well that's cool. - The other girls laughed at me. - Why did they laugh at you? - They said I'm not strong enough to be an astronaut. - And do you think that they're right? - I don't know. - You know, in Proverbs it says, As a man thinks in his heart, so is he. - What does that mean? - It means that if you think you're a scaredy cat, then you're gonna be a scaredy cat. But if you think that you're a strong girl, then you could very well grow up to be a strong and brave astronaut. Do you know what it means to be brave? - To not be scared. - Nope, being brave is when you have to do something even though you're scared. - [Girl] Really? - Mmhmm. - [Girl] Ali? - [Allison] Yep? - I wish I was brave like you. (campfire crackling) - So that's the story of how I tried to high five a blind guy. - I don't get it. - Um, does anybody else wanna go next? - Ali can sing. - Amaris, no, no guys, I can't sing. - Come on, you gotta do it, Ali. - [Crowd] Come on. - Come on Ali, you're good at it. - Okay, okay. ♪ I need thee every hour ♪ ♪ Most Gracious Lord ♪ ♪ No tender voice like thine ♪ ♪ Can peace afford ♪ ♪ I need thee every hour ♪ ♪ Stay thy nearby ♪ ♪ Temptations lose their power ♪ ♪ When thou art nigh ♪ ♪ I need thee, oh, I need thee ♪ ♪ Every hour I need thee ♪ ♪ Oh bless me now my Savior ♪ ♪ I come to thee ♪ (applauding) (uplifting music) ♪ The people are clamoring close, close to the ground ♪ ♪ My head and my heart are way up ♪ ♪ Up in the cloud ♪ ♪ My love is alive, my love is alive for you ♪ ♪ This is the perfect day ♪ ♪ This is the perfect day ♪ ♪ I forget how to breathe ♪ ♪ When your mouth whispers my name ♪ ♪ Tell me I'm yours, tell me your mine, never the same ♪ ♪ I'll light up the sky ♪ ♪ Light up the sky for you ♪ ♪ This is the perfect day ♪ ♪ This is the perfect day ♪ ♪ I wanna make it last forever ♪ ♪ I wanna make it last forever ♪ ♪ This is the perfect, this is the perfect day ♪ ♪ This is the perfect day ♪ (knocking) - [Allison] Yeah? - Hey, can I come in? - No boys allowed in the girls cabins. We could get sent home for that. What are you doing around here? - Well, I just want to bring this by. - What's this? - I mean, I went through and I found a few country songs that weren't horrible, but it was painful. - Wow, thanks. - Hey, you remember the other night when you sang? - I started out as a band geek and then got promoted to chorus dork, actually. - I mean, dork or not, that was still really amazing. - Thanks, so tell me something I don't know about you. - I can't whistle. - Really? Weird, but and not good enough. - Jeez, okay, I stuttered until I was 12. - Really? - Yeah, it took years of speech therapy. - That must have been really difficult. - Yeah, kids can be cruel. - Tell me about it. - Yeah, I think that's why I love working here so much. 'Cause for some of them, it's the only time someone believes in them, you know? - Yeah, it's a pretty amazing place. Can I get your advice on something? - Sure. - Okay, what would you do if you lied to someone that you really cared about, but to tell them the truth might mean losing their friendship? - Wow, that's deep. Well without knowing specifics, I'd say honesty is best. - Even if it would mean losing them? - Don't underestimate people. I mean, if they're really your friend, then they'll see your heart and understand. And if not, then it's their loss. (light upbeat music) Um, I better go before Nancy catches me in here. - See you at lunch. (dishes clinking) (suspenseful music) - Ali! - Kate! Kate! - What is wrong with you? - Nothing, I just-- - Enjoy cramming me into closets? - No, I can't explain, but you cannot be here right now. - Wow, thanks for that. - No, I just, hold on. Look, just go to your car, I will explain everything in a minute, I promise. You just have to leave. - What the heck, Allison? - I know, I'm sorry, I can explain. But first, how's your grandmother? - She's still in the ICU. I spent the night last night and I'm planning on going back again tonight. Thanks for asking, but what is going on? - Okay, so you know how I signed up for that online dating site? - Yeah. - Well I kind of used your picture for my profile. - You did what? - I know, it was stupid and I'm so sorry. Erin, she said I didn't have a chance and so I just thought that maybe if somebody could get to know me before they saw me, then maybe I could find someone. It was stupid, I'm sorry. - So why does that mean I get shoved into a closet? - It worked. - Huh? - I met someone, it's Justin. - Justin, that guy from your church, Justin? The one you've been crushing on for months? The one who's working at this camp? - Exactly. - And thus my banishment to the closet. (laughing) - I'm sorry, I panicked, I didn't know what to do. - So I take it he doesn't know it's you yet. - Oh gosh, no. - When are you gonna tell him? - Never. - How's that gonna work? - I don't know, I hadn't thought that far through yet. - Yep, perfectly executed plan. - He wants to video chat and obviously I can't do that. - You know what you should do? - If you say tell him the truth, I'm leaving. - Tell him the truth. - I can't, not yet, I'm not ready to lose him. When he finds out that his Allison is really this Allison, what do you think he'll do? - So what are you gonna do? - I'll tell him, just after camp's over. I'll see you at home. - There you are, I just wanted to bring you something sweet. I figured camp food was awful. - Thanks. - Hey Allison, why don't you go get us some drinks? Homemade brownies, cookies, and some candy. Chad told me your favorites. - Cool, thanks. - Personally, I don't eat a lot of sugar. I love sweets, but carbs are not my friend. So how's it going up here anyhow? There are thousands of kids. I don't think I could put up with them all. - Actually, we're having a really nice time, it's been fun. - Well, I can't really stay. I just wanted to bring you a little care package from home. - Thanks. - [Erin] Anytime. - You want a cookie? - No thanks. (light suspenseful music) - I'm gonna go. - Uh, oh yeah, I just remembered, I had to go to-- - So are you and Erin dating? - Erin? No. - She seems to think so. She certainly is pretty. - I guess. - So did you meet anyone from online? - Yeah. - Who's she? - Funny enough, her name is Allison. - Really? - Yeah, but we haven't met. - Is she pretty? - Yeah, she is, she's funny too. - But why haven't you met yet? - She said she's not ready. - [Allison] Why? - I don't know. - [Allison] Does she like you? - I think so. - So then what's the rush to meet her? - Just to put a face with her name. - A pretty face? - It's not just that. - Isn't it though? - What? - I mean, if she were hideous, would you even be interested? - Yes, but attraction is important too. - I have to go. (background chattering) - Okay everybody, let me have your attention. We finished the first week and you did a great job. Let's hear it for yourselves. (applauding) I just wanna thank you for giving your hearts to these children. And I want you to rest up this next week because we have a whole new set of kids coming on Monday. So remember to get all your stuff because we are having a cleaning crew come in and do deep cleaning, especially and ironically in the diligence cabin. - Yeah, diligence. (laughing) - And so rest up and I will see you all bright and early next Monday in AM. (applauding) Thank you so much, muah. (birds chirping) - Hey, Justin? - [Justin] Yeah? - I don't want things to be weird between us. I know I freaked out the other day and I'm sorry. - That's all right. Erin, she comes and goes as she pleases. I didn't even know she was coming. - So we're okay? - No worries. - So I'll see you Sunday at Church? - Maybe, if you're lucky. (laughing) - [Allison] Bye, guys. - [Girls] Bye. - [Girl] I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too, I'll miss all of you guys. Have a good summer, bye. See ya later. Maddie, what's wrong? - Do you really think I'm brave? - Well of course I do, kiddo. - It's just, when I go home, I don't know if I'm gonna be as brave without you. - Maddie, why do you think you need to be brave at home? - It's just the kids at school, they can be kinda mean sometimes. - Yeah, the kids at my school can be kinda mean sometimes too. - Really? - Yep, hey, why don't you say you and I make a deal? - What kind of deal? - Well, when you're having a really bad day and you don't think you can be brave anymore, you pray for me and when I'm having a really bad day and I don't think I can be pray anymore, I'll pray for you. That way we know God is helping both of us, deal? - Deal. - Kate, she's gonna be fine. Your grandma is one of the strongest people I know. - They're running tests, but they don't know why she went into a coma. - Kate, I am so sorry. - Yeah, um, so how was camp with Romeo? - That's not why I'm there. - Whatever you say, I'm just glad to have you back for a few days. - Me too, I love working with those kids, but it's nice to be with adults for a week, you know. - So did you tell him? - Yeah. - [Kate] You said after camp was over. - But camp isn't over, I still have a whole nother week. - Well anyways, I was thinking, maybe I could come to church with you sometime. - Yeah, Kate that would be awesome. - Is this morning okay? - Kate, Justin's gonna be there. - Oh yeah, Justin. - But as soon as I tell him, of course-- - You are unbelievable, you're always telling me about how much God loves me and now when I need him most, your lie is in the way? - Kate, that's not-- - You know, no, I'll just see you at home. - Kate! (chair scraping floor) (people chattering) - Thanks, it was really good. Um hey, I gotta go, can I talk to ya'll another time? - Yeah sure. - Yeah, no problem. - All right, all right, thanks, sorry about that. - All right, see ya later. - Hey. - Hi. - How's your weekend? - Not great, actually. - Oh, I'm sorry, um, I was thinking, do you maybe want to go out to lunch? - No, I need to say something and if I don't say it now, I'm never gonna say it, so-- - Justin, I have something I need to tell you. - We're kind of in the middle of something. - Nope, uh uh, not anymore, need to tell you right now. - Give me a sec. What is going on? - Dude. - [Justin] What? - Allison isn't Allison, she's Allison. - What? - Online Allison isn't who you think she is. - What are you talking about? - Allison, the one standing right out there, is online Allison. - No, you're crazy. - No, I'm serious, I overheard that Allison talking to the online Allison and she was saying-- - You're not making any sense. - Okay, real Allison has a friend, who is hot by the way, and she's the one who's picture's on UNight. That Allison put up a fake picture of hot Allison, so she's been lying to you all this time. - No, no, that can't be right. - I'm tell you, man, yes. - Why would she do something like that? - How should I know? But you've been getting played, my friend. (knocking) - Yes? - Allison? - Who is it? - It's Justin. - What do you mean Justin? - Justin, Justin, Justin. - He's outside? - Yes, he's outside. - Don't let him in. - You have to talk to him. - I don't want to talk to him. - But you have to talk to him now. (knocking) - Kate, please, I don't wanna. Kate, don't open that door, don't open that door. (door slamming) What are you doing? - You have to talk to him. - I don't wanna talk to him. - That's the second time the door's been slammed in his face, he's gonna leave. - Good, great, I hope he does leave. I don't wanna talk to him. I promise you, if you open this door, I will never be your friend again. Please, please, don't open up this door. - Allison, Allison, you're gonna have to talk to him sooner or later. You've got to talk to him. - Okay. - Hi, I'm not Allison. - That's Kate, my roommate, I'm Allison, both Allisons. - I don't understand. - I used her picture instead of my own. - Why? - Do you really think you would have given me a second look if I'd used my picture? - Of course. - Don't kid yourself, Justin. People like you don't go out with people like me. - Why couldn't you just tell me the truth? - I wanted to. I'm sorry, I never thought I would meet someone and I never dreamed it would be you. I'm so sorry. - I have to go. - Justin! - Hey. - I'm so sorry about your grandmother. - Thanks, the funeral's Thursday. I'm gonna miss her a lot, she was an amazing woman. But if she were here, she would say, Pick up your head Katie, today's a new day. - She's right. - You wanna face it? - Nope. - [Katie] How long are you going to mope? - Until it stops hurting. - But camps starts today. - Good for it. - [Katie] Are you not going? - Right. - But no one at camp knows about what happened. - Except him. - So you're telling me that you're just going to skip out on those kids because of some guy? - He's not just some guy. - Ali, you've been going on and on about how amazing it is to work with those girls, about how blessed you felt to be able to share Jesus with them. And now you're just going to throw that all away? When I finally decided I needed to go to church, you wouldn't let me because of Justin. And now you're going to give up on those girls because of Justin, you know I'm right. It's time to be brave. (solemn music) - Father, I pray for Maddie, Lord. Please give her strength and courage. And Lord, please help her to be brave. In Jesus name, Amen. - Tonight is hot fudge sundae night. (cheering) After dinner, which is at six. And that's all I've got, so go to your cabins and your children will be there any minute now. Hey Allison, what's wrong? - Nothing, I'm fine. - Have you heard from Justin? - No, why? - Well, I thought you might know why he quit. - He quit? It's my fault. - Okay. - I used my roommate's picture for my online dating profile. He responded and I've been pretending to be her online while being me here at camp and he found out. - I see. - I thought he'd be here, I almost didn't come myself. I'm so ashamed. - Why did you lie about your profile? - Isn't it obvious? - I don't think so, I think you're a beautiful young woman and you love God and you love people and I'm shocked. - Too bad the rest of the world doesn't see it that way. - Well, who cares what the world sees or doesn't see. I mean, at the end of the day, you decide what you wanna see. And who cares if the whole worlds likes you or thinks you're beautiful if you don't. - But I hate what I see in the mirror. - Then we have to change mirrors. You look in the mirror and you see what you think other people see, your shortcomings, and your inadequacies, and your mistakes, but if you look in God's mirror, you see a masterpiece. - When I look at the mirror, I'll I see is that I'm fat. Is that how God intended for me to be? - No, he wants us to be healthy, but when you know what he says about you, you treat yourself differently. It changes everything, you're a princess, you're a daughter of the king. - So Jesus loves me and everything's okay? - Yes, he said that you were made in his image, that you are highly favored and blessed, that you have hope and a future, that you are fearfully and wonderfully made. That is the truth. - Thank you. (light music) (keys jingling) (phone vibrating) Hey, it's me, Allison. Justin, please call me back, please. - Hey, I just wanted to stick my head in and see how you're doing? - He won't return my calls or my texts. - Hmm, his loss. - I've been thinking about what you said, about the mirrors. - Good, well I have a board meeting, but can we talk later? - Sure. - Okay, great. - Hey, it's me again, I promise, this is the last time I'm gonna call. I know that what happened wasn't fair to either of us and I know that I hurt us both. But I just wanted to say thank you for being so amazing and for helping me believe in myself. I'm gonna be just fine. I just wanted to say goodbye, goodbye Justin. - I don't think I could do that whole summer camp thing. I need my summers off, you know? I mean, I deserve to have two full months to relax and have fun. So, remember the last time we were here? - Yep. - It was the first time we met, isn't that so sweet. And here we are on our first date. You totally have to remember this place, so if you ever propose, you can totally do it here. Yep, we were right here. You were sitting down, talking to Chad, isn't he the best? - The best. - I mean, he was so sweet to leave us alone to talk. Well, until that cow, Allison, ran into me and almost poured coffee all over my designer shirt. She is so horrible. - You don't even know her. - Oh, I know her, I used to work with her. She's so big, she calls herself a Christian. Love others as you love yourself. So anyone who would let themselves get that fat must hate themselves. And if you hate yourself, you must be horrible. - Wow. - What? - That is the most ignorant, condescending, stuck up thing I have ever heard. - Did you just call me ignorant? - Yes and stuck up, I've had two conversations with you and all you've done is criticize people. You are the most shallow person I have ever met. (knocking on door) - Hi. - What do you want? - Can I come in and talk to you for a minute? - Fine. - Allison told me you weren't at camp. - Nope. - Okay, well, I guess I'll get right to it then. - Please do. - Allison's always seen the best in me, even when there wasn't much good to see. She's seen me make some really stupid decisions, do some really bad things, but she's always pushed me to be better without judging me. - Okay. - But the one thing she can't see if how wonderful she is. She has such a kind heart, she wants the best for people, but I think she's afraid to hope for the best for herself. If I endured as much hate as she has, I'd wonder if there was someone out there who could love me too. But I do know one thing, she's always the first to forgive. She's faithful, loyal, honest, she's such a great friend. - Honest, really? - You know, she was making the profile on her lunch break. Erin came in and told her that no one would want her if they saw the real her. Look, I know she should have told you, but she was afraid of losing you. When you were reading all those messages, did you feel the connection? - Yeah. - And at camp? - Yeah. - The only thing she ever lied about was one picture. Every word she sent was her. So it seems to me that the only question is which do you want more, the picture or the girl? - Well excuse me. (door shutting) All right son, now that's what I'm talkin' about. - It's not what you think. - Whatever you say, man. I knew once you left that little camp bubble, you'd wake up. - What? - And I knew that chubby chaser thing was just a phase. (thud) - You're an idiot. (door slamming) - Okay guys, so today I'm wanna talk to you about faith. Now the Bible says that faith is proof of what we can't see. Now who here thinks they know what that means? - It means that with faith, you can see things that others can't. - Justin, what are you doing here? - I've been an idiot, this whole time I've been looking for something, someone, and you were right in front of me. (light music) I'm sorry I didn't see you. (laughing) - I'm scarred for life. (laughing) (upbeat music) - I'm really, really proud of you and I know your grandma is too. - I'm not gonna lie though, I thought the water was gonna be warmer. (laughing) - Let's go inside. - Um, Ali? - Yeah? - I just wanted to apologize for not having the courage to be your real friend. - Well you're here now and that's all that matters to me. Come on. - [Waitress] Good evening, four? - Um, five, actually. - Is a booth okay? - You know, there's actually no way I'll fit into a booth, so a table would be great. - Oh, of course. - Have you guys ever been here before? Thank you. - [Woman] Hey, guys. - [All] Hey. - How are ya? - Good, how are you guys? - Good. - For God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance. The Lord looks at the heart. Sight is sometimes deceptive and how we view ourselves is usually tricky. So I have to ask you, what mirror are you looking in? (knocking) (laughing) - [Justin] Let me knock first. - I am psychic. (laughing) - Sorry. Look, (laughing) I'm sorry. - I got stuck in the chair. - Hey Allison, so did you sign up to help out over at Camp, uh. - [Allison] Over at Camp Kids? (laughing) - Let me get that. - Okay. (laughing) - So sorry. - [Man] Hang on, hold up, hold up, hold up. - How embarrassed you are, I was doin' the exact same thing. - [Woman] Scene 11B, shot F, take one. ♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪ (laughing) - Don't make me do this. (knocking) Oh, okay, sorry, that was different than last time. Don't knock on the door. - He's not suppose to knock on the door yet. - He's not suppose to knock. Don't knock on the door, let's go back. Keep rolling, this is it. Oh, I'm supposed to say not you, sorry, do it again. (laughing) Go, go, what are you doing? Stop, get it together, let's go. I'm gonna get up first. - That was, I was gonna say my line. - [Woman] Scene 22, shot D, phase three. Take one. - Sorry. (laughing) - I'm sorry. - We were rollin' that whole time. - [Woman] Why don't you come sit with me? (laughing) - That's not why-- - [Katie] No, you know what, I'll just see you. (laughing) - Have you guys been here before? - [Man] Can we do that again? We're gonna keep rolling. You need to be a little bit happy that you're here. - Be happy, be happy. - Do I seem sad? - [Man] Just be a little bit happier you're here. - [Woman] Am I good, is mine? - [Man] The shirt, yeah, the whole thing doesn't fit on her. (laughing) All right, come on, we gotta hurry. - [Crowd] Hi, Alligator Allison. - What are your names? (laughing) - [Man] What up? - What? What? (laughing) Do you think about what you say before you, blah, blah.
