SIX YEARS EARLIER Miss… Everybody's waiting for you. I won't go. Count de Peyrac could have come himself. If my brother were here, he'd put a stop to this. Your brother, Countess, with all due respect… May God rest his soul, fourteen years and no news. Peyrac is a lucky man. Your daughter's magnificent. Largely thanks to the dresses the count sent. A dress is merely a pretty wrapping. Dung in a dress… Sister. …is still dung. Anyway, I doubt that dress is one of the count's. I'm Marquis d'Andijos. I represent my friend Count de Peyrac. He refused to come? -No, but events… -What events? He will inform you. As soon as all is signed, we'll set off. If you'd be so kind. My dear cousin! Welcome! My dear cousin. I hope you had a good journey. The prosecutor, my daughter Hortense's husband… -Uncle… -Hortense! -Lord Prosecutor… -Marquis… I'm happy to see you, cousin. My respects, cousin. It's been so long. Your daughter is much changed. She's a proper lady. Your son likewise. I mean, he's a man now. This strapping fellow has frequented fields of battle and returned with honors and a reputation for bravery and cruelty. Angélique, my sincere congratulations. What a beautiful young woman you are! Beautiful? And fit only to be sold to a man I've never met. If you'll excuse me… Besides congratulating your delightful daughter, I'm here to conclude our business. You have the money now, I believe. Of course. If you'd care to, let's complete one last formality while all the witnesses are here. Gentlemen, if you'd be so kind as to join me in signing my daughter's act of marriage to Count de Peyrac. No! No! No! I won't go! I'll lead the life I choose. I won't sell my heart and body to an old invalid! Calm down. Keep your council. You came to collect your debts. Wrong, cousin. Their business is not mine. I hope your husband makes you happy. -You know him? -No. I have heard he's disfigured but… he's a good, experienced lover. Cousin… Will you intervene to stop this? I devote my energies to the king. But hitched to your devil, you'll be a fine prey. You're a boor, cousin. I am less and less jealous of Peyrac. Everybody's looking for you. I knew I'd find you here. Why don't you run away? With me, together. I'll take care of you, protect you. I love you, Angélique. You're a brother to me, Nicolas. You mean, I'm not noble enough. You love me? You want me? Take me! The count will reject an adulteress. Take me. -Stop it. -Go on! It's her horse, your lordship. How dare you? You brigand! I'll have you hanged! If you do, I won't marry. Go! They'll hang you! Go! Forgive my stupidity. Don't let me catch you in these parts! Sell me like an animal and I behave like one. Bless me, Father, for I am full of rancor. Open your heart, my girl. I am to marry a man I don't know. A man I don't love. I won't make a good wife. If not for you, your family would be ruined now. -Your father's love… -Not love. He invested in me. Chase the anger from your heart. Before your marriage, make peace with God. From your previous life, have you sins to confess? Yes, Father. A secret that has always tormented me. By my fault, a priest died. Mother had left us, carried off by marsh fever. Father took me on a visit to his cousin, my uncle, the Marquis de Plessis Bellière, to seek financial aid. They left me alone while they discussed business. Then I noticed my cousin Philippe. You? No, you. Your smile could cause me to take umbrage. How very gracious. My lord. Leave us, young people. Your Excellency, forgive us. So vitriol. It's a slow but sure poison. It could be blamed on a rotten oyster or meat that had gone off. Very well. The plotters signed these, swearing loyalty. When young Louis is dead, they'll make me their sovereign. You reassure me. We'd hate France to fall into anarchy, partly by our fault. His lordship was called away. -Wait here. -You are mistrustful. I am cautious. Your presence is requested. The letters? Where are they? I have no idea, sire. -I didn't leave the room. -You have accomplices. Here's how I deal with traitors! And the man? The murderer? Did you see him? Have no fear. Your secret is safe with me. My lady… Your husband, Count de Peyrac. Welcome to your domain, Countess. You are more beautiful than I was told. And I even uglier than you heard. My lord, do you know the woman you would marry? I like nothing better than lazing in bed. I hate hunting and loathe to be contradicted. I was raised by a witch who taught me evil spells. I despise the frippery of the court. I… I am inordinately jealous. I prefer female company. -You wanted to see me, ma'am? -Yes. Do you know the woman you would marry? Sorry, but I see your belongings are unpacked. You wish to return home? Only you can make that decision. Nothing will make me. Except your resolve, of course. But let's discuss that later, if you will, the ceremony awaits us. I thought a modest celebration would be best so soon after your arrival. We shall wed in the chapel in a private ceremony, if you have no objection. I appreciate your choice. I shall leave you to prepare. The red one would suit you wonderfully. The Countess de Peyrac… After you… May we begin? Your priest dislikes me. He's not my priest, he's the Archbishop of Toulouse. It's not you he dislikes, it's me. He hates me. Why does he celebrate your marriage? He has no choice. My family is one of the oldest in Languedoc. But for him, I'm the devil. Are you not? The devil would adopt a seductive form, don't you agree? Your reputation for sharp wits is deserved. Who gave you such information? The nuns. -And their opinion of me? -All bad. To my great delight. Why did you not come yourself? Why send your henchmen? Your lackeys? They are no henchmen, no lackeys, but loyal friends. That fails to explain your absence. I could not once more allow the archbishop and his zealots to exploit my absence, as they did by annexing the university for the archbishopric. Actually, I heard the journey would tire you out. I'm touched by your concern for my health. To the Count and Countess de Peyrac! He has no such concerns. My latest recruit and best blade. Admire his vigor! To the Count and Countess de Peyrac! Thank you, friends. To King Louis XIV! And down with obscurantism! You bear the king a grudge? Compounding our King and obscurantism… Peyrac, you have a twisted mind. No. I'm merely a Catholic. Fervent, sincere, but prudent. Do you know my story, your Grace? At my birth, my mother chose a wet nurse, not for her religion but the size of her bosoms. This woman, a Protestant, took me to her village in the Cevennes. There occurred one of those silly wars between the local Catholic lord and the Protestant lord nearby. The villagers were put to the sword. As for me, face slashed, I was thrown out the window. Thank God, the snow cushioned my fall. I survived. With many broken bones. A Catholic soldier recognized me and brought me back to my mother. I learned to walk at the age of 12. Yes, monsignor, I believe in the Holy Catholic Church but you will never cure my distrust of those who preach and fight in its name. The devil, Peyrac! The devil prowls around you. I'll make him welcome. -Men. -Come on, gentlemen. -Why provoke him? -Come on. En garde. To remind him of my opposition. Rest assured, our blood may boil but our minds remain cool. Come, monsignor… Let us drink to the reign of intelligence and enlightenment. We will smooth your skin with cream. The count likes the odor of ferns. Breathe in this scent. The night will be tender, ma'am. -Let me dry you off. -I can do it myself. -Come. -Thank you. LETTERS FROM NINON DE LENCLOS TO THE MARQUIS DE SÉVIGNÉ Have no fear. How did you get in? A secret exit is always useful. Expect nothing of me. You bought me like an animal. I'm a woman. I've waited years for one like you. Waiting a few more days or weeks is in my power. I'll never belong to you or let you touch me. That's correct. You will come to me. CHAUMONT ABBEY This way. Your lordships, I was expecting you. Abbot, I am the superintendent. The prince needs no introduction. Monsignor, I only betray the seal of confession because I am in your debt. Open your heart. The murderer? Did you see him? I only saw his hands. Adorned with rings. On one of them, two crossed swords. What did she do with the letters? No. She would say no more. She claimed she felt unwell and left. Gentlemen, please conclude without me. We are deeply indebted. Thank you. Has nobody ever told you, you possess the grace of Venus? That your shoulders, your bust, your waist and legs were sculpted by Vulca? Perfectly formed. That you're a Madonna made for love? Do not deny it. I know it. I sense you. My lord, where is your niece now? Toulouse. She recently married Count de Peyrac. Peyrac is a man of power and independence. He keeps away from court, but we clearly cannot run the risk. We need him out of the way to be sure of controlling your niece. Fortunately, Peyrac has made enemies, even in Toulouse. Your ladyship… Welcome to our home. The count is out… I came to speak with you, ma'am. I hope you are not, unlike your husband, one of these so-called "libertines." I am deeply Catholic. As I was taught. You don't practice alchemy, like your husband? Are you aware your husband is rumored to have the suspicious ability to turn sand into gold? I know of no censurable activity by my husband. Monsignor, on your quest for the devil, as ever. I'm afraid we have cleaned up. Show the monsignor out. I thank you for defending me. A fine idea, to provoke him. Have you taken leave of your senses? Copernicus. Galileo. These books are forbidden. By the church, not by reason. Toulouse is the seat of the Inquisition. My seat, also. I cannot pretend the world does not revolve. I agree with you there. That's what I fight for. There's no need to proclaim it. Your blaspheming could be interpreted as heresy or witchcraft. You suspect me of those? Heresy? No. But witchcraft, definitely. How else do you produce gold? Very impressive. We're going down. I'd say that's impossible. Trust me. No! Don't be alarmed. These ropes carry hundreds of kilos. But nothing will stop us smashing into the rock if you wriggle like a clucking hen. Remove your hand and the hen will be calm. Morning, gentlemen. -How goes it, Quentin? -Your lordship. Look at this sand. It's auriferous. Melted in furnaces with iron, it becomes gold. Do you see the hand of the devil? Gold makes you pensive? Not gold. What one does with it. What would you do? I'd charter a ship and sail out to sea in search of a man. -Help yourself. It's yours. -No. And you? Why all this gold? It guarantees that which I cherish most. Freedom. Freedom, indeed. Why deprive me of it? Your father convinced me you'd agreed. I was mistaken. Go whenever you wish. My family cannot reimburse the sums you paid us. I do not ask you to. We'll say our marriage was not consummated due to… my incapacity. Consider yourself free, therefore, and intact. Is choosing your destiny abnormal? Is mine simply to be the floozy of a man I didn't choose and don't love? You must not have listened to the nuns' teachings. For you nobles, marriage is not a love affair, it's a business affair. Nobles have rights and duties. Men to the army and women being bartered. Perhaps it's time to do the deed. It's often the best remedy. Honestly, Margot! I know you like my own blood. I saw you grow up horsing around like a tomboy. Whatever you do, within you, Countess, beats the heart of a beauty. Why not make the most of it? Have no fear, have faith. Waiting brings nothing to pass. Except life passing by. With all due respect, my lady. A black woman, never! I'll marry my beloved! No, no, no, I leave. Jean! Jean! I came to say goodbye. And give you these, which arrived this morning. Don't blame Margot. For your sake, she mentioned your brother, whom you'd devote your life to finding. Nothing stands in your way. I thought only death would stop him sending word to you via travelers he encountered. I asked your father to search your late mother's belongings for letters she may have received and omitted to pass on. After looking long and hard, luck smiled upon us. May they reassure you and brighten the long journey ahead of you. Doubtless, one day, you will seek him out overseas. I wish you a safe journey, ma'am. And a long life. If you'll excuse me, I'll go back to my experiments. Stop! In the bed chamber. Put me down. I'm not dead, for goodness' sake. Yes, sir. Don't move, sir. The archbishop was right. You're in thrall to the devil. No, ma'am. Only to lead and sulphur. We made a slight miscalculation. I appreciate your concern, my lady. Don't let me keep you. Goodnight, Count de Peyrac. I didn't thank you for the letters. Thank you. Overcome the fever first. My dear, sweet sister, here I am, far away, across the sea, with my beloved Kalimba, whose dark skin withstands so well the desert sun. Darling Angélique, do you know you are now aunt to a delightful Celestin? Thirty inches, six pounds at birth. Rock solid. With his mother's ebony skin. Attack Count de Peyrac? Not to be taken lightly. His fortune will soon outstrip the Church's. And even the king's. Let's not exaggerate. Shall we? He must have a weakness. The only one I see is that he loves his wife. That's our way to provoke him then. -At the castle ball. -Exactly, dear nephew. -Lead him to his downfall. -This is our chance. Has nobody ever told you, you possess the grace of Venus? That your shoulders… Your bust… Your bust… Your waist… Your hips… And legs were sculpted by Vulca? …legs were sculpted by Vulca? Perfectly formed. -You're a Madonna made for love. -You're a Madonna made for love. -No, don't deny it. -Don't deny it. I know it. I know it. I sense you. I found this on your bed. I must see you in secret. Your loved ones are in peril. Meet me at the fountain. -Good evening. -Good evening, Count de Peyrac. Good evening… I'm glad to see you up and about. Good health, my friend. Angélique isn't here? -Isn't that your first failed experiment? -Count de Peyrac. To catch your wife's suitor, be at the fountain later. I thought it might hasten your recovery. And accelerate your departure. Unless it's for another's pleasure. Are you still feverish? Hallucinating? I thank you for these extra hours of happiness and hope they are no burden to you. Only once you are gone will I undertake new experiments. Sir! Stop, ma'am! I wrote the note that brings you here. It was you? -What peril… -I love you! Stop, sir! And draw your sword! Joffrey, no. He used me to provoke you. Don't risk your life. Your honor and mine are priceless. Like your love. He drew first. It's a fair duel. You saw that, Count d'Andijos. Whatever provoked your betrayal, if God gives me breath, I shall uncover the reasons. You're full of surprises. I learned to fight limping. A neglected art in your academies. More's the pity! Joffrey! I treated you like a son. Why provoke me to a duel? See you in hell, my lord. Have mercy. Spare him. Show me the wound. Watch out! -There you are, sir. -Thank you, gentlemen. Countess. Let me see your arm. It still bleeds. It's nothing serious. It will heal. It's my fault. Let me talk. Count, I must fulfil my conjugal duties. Tonight, we sleep together. You aren't leaving? No! I'm giving myself to you. Like a wife to her husband. Do not feel obliged. It was a hard day. You can testify to that. Stop that now. Have you heard the news? The king is to marry the Infanta of Spain, to ensure peace between our two countries. The wedding ceremony will take place at the border. On the way there, his Highness will stay over at Peyrac's castle. Rest assured, we still have a man there. There is no lack of money-grabbing servants. Do you love me? I could not dream of a better husband. I admire you. I find you handsome. Handsome? In your own special way, you are very handsome. But do you love me? Apparently not. All the same, I love doing lots of things with you. The king! Ahead of time. We forgot the king! The king! Count de… Children! Cantor! Florimont! Come along, my boy. Now, listen to me. We're meeting the king. When His Majesty arrives… Long live the king! Peyrac. Sire… My wife. I was informed of your fortune but not of your real treasure. Countess, my humble respects. You must be delighted, Countess. People talk only of you and your husband. Saying he's crippled, disfigured and moribund. -Naturally. -Sir. But comparing his fortune to the king's. And commenting that marriage has not spoilt you. I confess, I'd happily tumble you. My husband is the only man for me. I have no feelings for you, cousin. I am happy. If I'm attacked, I always riposte. So, be prepared. What do you see on these faces? Jealousy and fear of too much wealth and power. I fear that one day you'll wake up to a nasty shock. Advise your doddery demon to beware. Your cousin Philippe, I presume? Indeed. Philippe de Plessis Bellière, even more decorated than last I saw him. With all those ribbons, are you in His Majesty's ballet? Yes. As the king's grand marshal. Your cousin has a problem with authority. I congratulate you on making her happy. It is a happiness she returns in kind. And one that provokes much envy. Peyrac, I wished to see you. Sire… I hear you wring gold from rock. Exaggerated rumors. The truth is more complex. I extract gold from minerals using methods new to us but well-known across the Rhine. You will have to show me. Whenever you wish, sire. I should add that for me gold is merely a means to an end. A means to opening universities, to funding scholars, to fostering knowledge, not fearing it. I am chided for allowing nobles to buy rank, but you are of the oldest noble stock. Were you in Paris, I'd elevate you to the highest position. The countess and I are preparing a long journey and… In Paris, I'd be a provincial out of my depth. Let me serve you well in the provinces, rather than badly in the capital. Very well said. Now, this quarry of gold. Describe it to me. The king and Prince de Condé must reconcile. If Peyrac attends court, the letters are a threat to Condé. It is our duty to ensure that doesn't happen. We must act at once. The opportunity is too good to miss. We hew the minerals out of the mine, bring it out on carts, then we crush it and wash it. In that hut there, we smash it and grind it. We blend it with iron and heat it to very high temperatures. That's why we need two bellows. We melt it once. The molten lead absorbs the gold particles. It is reduced to powder again before undergoing what's called cupellation, the separation of the gold and lead. The powder is melted in an earthenware pot producing a mixture of molten lead and gold particles. At the end of the operation, we are left with pure gold. This is the result. There you are, sire. Pure gold. It's time to go back up. Allow me to go first for security reasons. Wait, Peyrac. Peyrac? The king first. -As ever. -My God! We must do something. Help me! The brake! Leave me be! Make the most of this incident, sire. Remember all you heard. He'll never bend to your will. He said so. He refused to serve you here in Paris. What if such behavior were contagious? It's not personal, it's reasons of state. Do you want another nobles' revolt? He was never my enemy. He does not oppose my authority. Crush him anyway. Potential opponents will tremble all the more. The charges against him are ridiculous. They won't stand up in court. With your backing, they will. The more your power is felt behind this trial, the more you will be feared. What is this? The king has left. Take care of Angélique, Cantor and Florimont. Count Joffrey de Peyrac d'Irritu, the king orders your arrest. How sad to see a grand marshal reduced to a lowly constable. -The countess is also under arrest. -No, not her. Or we shall fight. If not, you will disarm? A Marshall decides, a constable obeys. Let me bid her farewell. Hurry. My beloved. How dare Philippe! He does his duty but lets you go free. He's not your enemy. You can't let them do this. You must fight. I'll go with them. I shall fight later. I love you. Be strong. Well? Did you see the king? Neither the king nor anybody else. They flee discussion of the count. Joffrey is Count of Toulouse. Have you no support locally? I could raise an army in days. The king would execute Joffrey and crush us. -It's madness. -Then I'm mad. We go to Paris. After his wedding, the king will hear us. The count gave me orders. To protect me, not to hinder me. You'll never hold me back. I'll give you the slip somewhere, so let's not waste time. I'll never abandon my husband. He needs a defender. My uncle will give good counsel. Joffrey sensed that trouble lay ahead. His arrest is not a royal caprice, but the work of hidden enemies. In Paris, they will confront you unseen. Trust no one, even those closest to you. No one. Out of the question! Just one night. A renegade's wife in the prosecutor's house? Get out now! Hortense, take my children at least. You were so proud of your great wizard. Accept the consequences. There you are. My sister asks us to take in her children. Countess, you and your children can stay as long as necessary. Thank you, sir, but my servant and I need nothing. Goodnight, sweetheart. Won't you give me a kiss? Mummy, why are you leaving us? THE BASTILLE A third of your fortune? Should the king consider this a loan? A gift. Towards the cost of his wars and building projects. I hope this will demonstrate my attachment and secure my peace of mind. I see. Please ensure that this letter is delivered to the king in person. No lawyer will accept such a client, who stands accused by the king. No matter. Joffrey is innocent. I don't refute that. Of course he is, but appearances… I need to see the king. Sorry? I'm sure that if I can have even a brief word with his Majesty, I shall convince him. And I have things to tell him. Things? Children's stories that might interest him. I doubt the king appreciates such tales, my dear, but I'm thrilled you're so keen to prove his innocence. Allow me to see the king. The king? Don't raise your hopes. Sorry, but you overestimate my influence. Perhaps a privy councilor will see you. Count de Vallauris… No, his influence is limited. I know! Prince de Condé will surely receive you. The prince it is! I'll charm him until he takes me to the king. Joffrey de Peyrac, I am the Reverend Father Kircher. I'm here to exorcise you. Let us through. -Here? -Yes, here. You'll find none other, nor better. He's a paragon of wit, integrity and courage. The very man you need. -Not a word to Hortense, of course. -Of course. Whore! Come here, beauty! I'll give you money. Sorbonne! He's drunk. Don't be scared, he's harmless. -I'm looking for Desgrez, a lawyer. -Follow the dog. Mr. Desgrez? Your ladyship. My dog was trained to catch deserters. If I'd said "Maul," he'd have mauled the drunkard's neck. I can't offer you a drink. Times are hard for us lawyers. Take a seat. I think I should go. I don't inspire confidence, I know. Were I in your shoes… But I alone will take this case. It's not a good reason, I agree, but I alone have nothing to lose. Added to which, I am competent, obstinate, and impervious to fear now. Your husband is in the Bastille. Don't be alarmed, it is in fact a good sign. The Bastille is the prison for nobles. Those courtiers who are too insolent or outspoken go in and out all year long. I am Desgrez, the lawyer hired by your wife to defend you. -My wife? -She is safe. No, she needs protection. I don't know who threatens her or why, but she's in danger. Joffrey de Peyrac, having been stripped of his titles and dispossessed of his assets by decision of the king's council, is to be tried by the court for acts of witchcraft, spell-making and other acts that are offensive to religion, state security and the Church… Your Honor, we have no conceivable intention of offending this noble institution but the royal edict of… Of 26th June, 1621. The accused contests the validity of the Court. We enter our reservations. Mr. de la Reynie! What an honor. The Sheriff of the Realm at a poor wretch's trial. Now, no magistrate can claim to be unaware of the importance to the Crown of this trial and its result. -The courts are free. -And independent, I know. You haven't changed since university. Bravo. You defend the kingdom's most famous prisoner. You are a brave and intelligent man. Join me rather than fighting desperate causes. Your knowledge of the underworld will be vital to me. Join me. Nobody fights the King of France. The king must not subvert the courts. I shall win the trial. You shall burn your wings. This case is too big for you! Has the countess worked her charm on you? Me? Fall for a woman? A noble one, too? You are ill-informed. Peyrac will bring you down with him. Think fast. One can serve justice differently. Rely on me. You'll need help, I'm sure. Farewell. -You were here? -Yes. Who was that? A useful contact. Come. I went to your uncle's, as requested. He gave me this. Prince de Condé will see you shortly. It's cocoa. From America. The Infanta adores it. We too, therefore. Bitter, isn't it? A little. What would you say to a castle, servants, stables and 100,000 a year? And in return for such generosity? You know very well. You always knew. The letters. The letters you stole some years ago. Return them and you'll live. Richly. -And my husband? -It's out of our hands. My husband or nothing. Is it worth losing everything for a disfigured cripple? It's locked. Come. It's late, ma'am. The doors are locked, except in the gaming rooms. To leave, you must go out the back way. These stairs lead to the river. Watch your step. Let me open the door ahead. Flee! Margot? Margot? It's not her. The wrong one. It's her servant! Help! I'm in danger. Two men are chasing me. Only two? Excuse me. Stay back. Your father laid a trap for me. That doesn't surprise me. Are you his ally? We fell out. Why are you not in deepest Languedoc? Keep out of it. You are in danger here. So help me. One defends what one has conquered. Stop! Margot was just killed in front of me. I see no mortal dangers here, Countess. I must leave this place. Help me, please. You knew about your father? Out of! So, it wasn't a fairy tale. Say your prayers. I can kill two or three, not eight. Stay behind me. Go, sir! This isn't your business. I'm a Plessis Bellière, she's a Sancé. Our families are related since 1482. Her blood is my blood. Tell me, gents, who are you with? Stay out of this. And leave you to kill and rob? At the Louvre, perhaps. But you're on my territory now. Allow me to introduce myself. They call me Calembredaine. -You're outnumbered! -Take the girl! Angélique, behind me! Run for your life! That way! Fast! Help me! Go that way. Stop! -You bitch! -Stop it! I'll show you! You'll love this! Flipot the Lizard… At your service, ma'am. Is that enough? I only take what I steal, sir. Come on… Pick 'em clean and toss them in the Seine. May angels watch over you, Margot. Ma'am. You must go now. Come. Hurry, Sorbonne. We'll take you to safety. You will be safe here. I help the Prior in legal matters. He owes me a few small favors. Angélique, I want the truth now. Men try to kill you at the Louvre, then in the street, all by chance? How can I save your husband if you won't tell me? I must talk to Joffrey. -Is that all? -Yes, think of an idea. An idea? To enter the Bastille? Sorbonne! The whore for the prisoner. Let's take a look. You can look but not touch. You were right not to tell me. I'd have seen it as a ploy to keep me away from you. I'll give you one order that you must blindly obey. Leave Paris. Disappear. -You are their prey. -No. They want you dead. My dearest heart, I've been in worse situations. I have been poisoned, blades have cut through me, yet I am still here. Even if you know I'm dead and see my corpse, don't believe it. I'm no good at dying. But you must flee. Tell Desgrez. He is willing to fight authority. Make the most of it. You must protect our children. No! I want their father to raise them with me. Forgive me, I must disobey. Nothing and nobody will stop me trying to save you. What's wrong? I love you. What did you do with the letters? Talk to me. You destroyed them? No. They never left the castle. With luck, I'll find them. With Condé involved, those letters are political. In this country, when you set foot in politics… The way the trial's going, we have no choice. Fine. To retrieve the letters, what do you need? The Lizard. I see. -Flipot? -Yes, Flipot. So I need to visit the underworld. That's no place for you, ma'am. No. I request an audience with Stumpy. Lawyer, I often wonder why I don't slit your throat. I am certain the day will come when you oppose us. You will be our most fearsome adversary. For the time being, I pay. Yes. Why kill a good client? I need Flipot, the Lizard. Flipot… He's the best. We call as a witness Countess Lazareff. Do you know her? She's a former courtesan. You withdrew seven years ago to the Convent of Holy Grace after living at Count Peyrac's court. Did he perform barbaric rituals? Spiritualism? Acts of witchcraft? Did you witness them? Yes. In the name of Jesus, I swear I did. Your cousin is mad, my boy. Since her sorcerer husband was arrested, she has dishonored our family, but enough of that. Since when must a father explain his actions to his son? Since those actions stain the family name. Sleep easy, young pup. Our family name is and will remain spotless. You fear for your life? Keep out of my affairs. Take your leave now, son of mine. Easy does it. Be careful. Well? -Found them? -They're not there. The other side. Nothing. I'm coming down. Impossible. I put them there. No letters, nothing. It's a trap, Countess. Come on! Back to the castle. Go back! -Go around! -There they are! -Look, there! -They've gone inside! This way. This way. No, not that way. Follow me! Catch them! That way. Quickly. Keep together! Don't let them escape! Wait! Let's go. Against the wall. They're not here. I won't ask the reasons for your nocturnal visit. I thank you, cousin. I hope it was fruitful. No, actually. Here, where it began, I've lost all hope. Come. Is this what you came for? I lingered after you disappeared. To make you pay for your insolence. This one never existed. Be on your way now. How can I thank you? If they can help your demon, make good use of them. To Paris! She's there. Mr. de la Reynie. Mr. Desgrez. Have you taken holy orders? It's best not to be seen together. Last time we met, you made me an offer. I accept it. On one condition. I must see the king. You choose a bad time. Mazarin is dying. I have documents of interest to him. This way. Faster. Let's hurry! He died a good Christian. What does His Majesty plan to do? Until now, I let the late cardinal and the ministers govern for me. Now I am of an age to govern myself. Mr. Colbert, will they take me seriously? I am not completely sure, sire. Sire… I am Angélique, Countess de Peyrac, Baron de Sancé's daughter. I seek an audience. Let her go. My husband stands accused of treason, but the charges have been fabricated. The true plotters, who planned to kill you as a boy, are here. Your so-called plotters are no longer a threat to me. I trust them and control them. Because of their past, as it so happens. Sire. Your husband is beyond my control. He is too rich, too independent, too powerful. So he must die? -The court decides. -The trial is a farce. My husband's fate was sealed. By you. You're his executioner. Have some respect! Ma'am, our mourning saves you from arrest but never set foot here again. Eliminate the woman. Without fail. There will be no second chance. The letters burned. What do you… She saw me, understand? With the priest. I have no doubt now. Mazarin advised me to make an example of Peyrac. His Eminence's death frees your hands, surely? On the contrary, Colbert, it ties them tighter. Now, at least, they will begin to take me seriously. Guilty of plotting against Church and King, of sedition, impiety, magic, witchcraft and other abominations. He will be taken to Place de Grève and burned at the stake until his body and bones are reduced to ashes. These shall be scattered to the winds. Do you have anything to say? Do you wish to express remorse or regrets concerning your past life? What remorse or regret might I have? I accomplished all my follies and desires, while remaining free. Freer and healthier in body and mind than most of you, who are subjected to authority and despotism. I lived my life passionately. It allowed me to meet a unique woman, who must know that when you're done with me, even in ashes, I shall always protect her and our children. My greatest despair at this moment is leaving her. Take him away! The verdict is a parody! We demand justice! Arrest that man! Sorbonne! Sorbonne! Stop him! Come on. Joffrey? Nicolas! Stop! Welcome to my kingdom. How did you guess? Your laugh. I laugh no more. I scream with rage. Because of you, I became a thief, a beggar and a murderer. Your father broke his promise and sent men after me. I killed two. But you, I knew I'd find you one day. I just watched the prosecutor's house. Eventually, you'd come. And be mine. No, Nicolas. I love Joffrey. He's doomed. Save him. Why should I? Why? I'll do it then. By raising an army? Somewhere in his mansion house, Count de Peyrac hid treasure. Only I know where. Help me to release him and it's yours. Let's see your gold glimmer first, beautiful. No. First, help me to free Peyrac. When Peyrac is safe, I'll stay with you until the gold is yours. Joffrey, you're free! His execution was brought forward. Place de Grève. -Death to him! -Death… No! We must run. We must run or die! Stand aside! Our only chance of survival is to separate. I'll handle them. Listen! I'll never forget you. It was an honor to serve you. Come on. May God preserve you. You must live! Come on. That way! You, that way. And you, over there. We won't harm you. If you tell me where she is. Attack! Maul! Along there. She went this way! Hurry up! She died of cold and the fish did the rest. Yes, I recognize Countess de Peyrac, née Sancé. I also recognize Angélique de Sancé. May she rest in peace. You're one of us now. You'll be safe. She is safe, too. Awake at last. We thought we'd lost you. You've been unconscious for days. Why didn't you leave me to drown? Why not let me die? Because you are dead. A pauperess took your place. Nobody noticed. Countess or beggar, death is the same. What? Angélique de Sancé, Countess de Peyrac, drowned in the Seine. You are dead. And revived. Rejected by your caste, you shall rule here. Queen of the beggars, thieves and cripples! Queen of this netherworld of poverty and vengeance. You will be their Marquise. Marquise of the Angels. With us, you will learn to live again. I'll teach you to steal and kill, to beg and adopt disguises. You'll learn to work miracles, transforming yourself, beautiful and attractive, or old, worn, hunched and toothless. This is the Court of Miracles, where you learn to survive in a hostile world. I just want to die, Nicolas. If that's all you want, fine. Go ahead, the blade is honed. Go to meet your Peyrac! Go ahead! Your boys will join you. They're at my sister's. She and her husband are exiled in the provinces. They left the boys with a nanny they never paid. In Paris, children with unpaid nannies are left to die or sold! You're lying. Five, Rue de l'Archange-Olive. See for yourself. Come on, children. You don't work, you don't eat! Florimont, on your feet! Obey! Faster! -Mummy! -Children! -Mummy! -Children! Come with me. What's going on? Gaspard! She's taking the boys! If you want them, pay! Pay all that you owe or I'll call… Murderer! Murderer! Help! Murderer! Coming through! Long live Louis XIV! That is Louis Dieudonné de Bourbon, Louis XIV, King of France. He murdered your father. I hereby swear that I shall regain rank, power and riches and restore Peyrac's good name. Even if you know I'm dead and see my corpse, don't believe it. I'm no good at dying.
