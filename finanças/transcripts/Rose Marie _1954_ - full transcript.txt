Hey, there. Hey, boy. Hey... there. Come here, boy. Hey, I'm looking for the cabin of trapper Lemaitre. Do you know it? I said, I'm looking for.. Look, I can't shout my head off, come closer. What's the matter, boy? Scared? I won't bite you. Come here. That's better. I'm looking for the cabin of tra.. Hey, boy. You're a girl. Well, it's a, it's a girl I'm after. The daughter of trapper Lemaitre. They call her.. So, you're Rose Marie. 'Rose Marie Lemaitre.' Mine's Mike. Mike Malone. Maybe you've heard tell of me from your father. 'Well, last fall, when-when he was sick' he-he knew he won't pull through the winter so he asked me to come up here and look after his little girl when-when he was gone. 'You've been all alone up here and that's bad.' But you don't have to worry about being alone anymore. Hey! Come back, here. Hey! Rose Marie. Rose Marie. Rose Marie. Rose Marie! Rose Marie. Rose Marie. Rose Marie! Now, listen first and stab me afterwards, huh? You really don't think you can get away from a Mountie, do you? Mounties always get their man. Even when it's a girl. Now, look, let's get-together on this whole thing. I don't want you, you don't want me but we're stuck with each other. I'm taking you to Fort McCroy, those are my orders you might as well make up your mind and don't start anything. It won't do you bit of good. Monsieur,please. Let me go. I beg you. Look, you really are scared, aren't you? Well, you don't have to be. I'm your friend. The inspector told your father he'd take care of you and-- - I take care of myself. - We'll argue about that later. Without knives. But right now, you're going with me. You know you can't stay here all alone. Your father knew that. A man might get by, but not a girl. I live here all my life. I love it. I'm not afraid. I love it too. But it's no place for a girl. Everybody knows that. Stories about it, even songs. It's no place for a girl. (Howard Keel singing "The Right Place For A Girl") Where the cataracts roar And the north winds blow And the snow flakes eddy and whirl For a man it's a wonderful shore But it's no place for a girl When the water birds soar from the frozen stream And the land turns to mother of pearl 'Tis a place for a man and his dream But it's no place For a girl A girl must have the best of things A chance to bud a chance to blossom Ladies fingers are made for rings Not for skinning the hide of a possum The more that you live The more you will learn As the years of your life unfold In the arms of a man The right kind of man Is the right place For a girl Alright, let's go. You wanna ride to Fort like this or you want to sit in the saddle like a lady? I sit. Fort McCroy detachment, all present and correct, Sergeant. Carry on, Corporal. 'Eyes front!' Eyes front! Sit down. - Johnson. - 'Yes, Sergeant.' Go ahead. Men, uh, we have ourselves a new recruit. This is Rose Marie Lemaitre. Would you care to say, hello, dear? She wants to be friendly, but she's just a child. And you know how it is with kids action speak louder than words. Eyes front! McCorkle! Right here, Sarge. Sergeant. Sergeant. You mean, I've been promoted? Promoted? Of course not. Promises. That's all I get. Promises. I've been here long enough to be a Field Marshal. I-I got a good notion to hand in my two weeks notice. In the meantime you got yourself a new prisoner. - A tough one. - Tough? Well, they come no tougher than Barney McCorkle. I'm a tower of strength. A monument of muscle. A bundle of biceps. Just watch out for your fingers. Fingers? I've been neglecting my cuticle. Alright, Mac. Whatcha in for, murder? A girl. A small, diminutive girl. Well, anyway, a girl. Please, nice gun man. You have face so nice, kind. Please. You let go me, yes? Look, girlie. If I let go you, they let go me. And on a clear day, I can see my pension. What's your name, girlie? Uh, Minnie? Fiffy? Lily?

I'm-I'm pleased to meet your acquaintance. Let go off those keys. (Howard Keel singing "Mounties") On thru' the hail Like a pack of angry wolves on the trail We are after you dead or alive We are out to get you dead or alive And we'll get you too In peace or war We're the story of Canada Cheer for the Corps for the glory of Canada Here come the Mounties The Maple Leaf Forever more Through thunder and hail Following trouble Following trouble Oh travel the trail ride on the double Ride on the double A cheer for the Mounties For here come the Mounties We ride winter or spring And as we ride we sing In war or peace There is no one like the Royal Police Men who'll always be loyal and true To the uniform of scarlet and blue Ever unafraid In peace or war We're the story of Canada Cheer for the Corps for the glory of Canada Here come the Mounties The Maple Leaf Forever more Fort McCroy, all present and correct, sir. Well, well. Looks like, I've been away too long. Bad shave. Button needs polishing. Bad shave. Stirrup too low. Bad shave. Bad shave. Don't any of you men know how to use a razor? Now, that's what I call a shave. Yes, sir. 'Are you by any chance, stark raving mad, my friend?' Sir? I said, are you out of your mind? Good grief! I don't know which to have you discharged for. Insubordination or congenital idiocy. I don't quite follow the Inspector. Sergeant, has the thought ever entered your child-like brain that this wild gal of the woods who lives the life of a Mountie like any other man, is not a man at all? But a woman, sir. A fully developed woman. Well? I'm waiting. A fully developed.. Rose Marie? - Why, sh-she's just a kid, sir. - She's a woman! With all that that fact implies. You mean tha-- I mean what I say, confound it! She's a woman. An adult female person, you've heard the word. A woman. Well, I'd-I'd never thought of her that way, sir-- You better start right now. You better start right now. And soon as you start it, stop. Uh, miss, come in here. Come in here. Oh,bonjour monsieur. Oh, Mike, Mike, you know what Harold does just now when I give him his dinner? Eat with good appetite, the food. Then turn and kiss me here. Ho, behold,monsieur.Still red. What did I tell you? Who's Harold? - Her horse, sir. - Oh, a fine horse,monsieur. Old, but still alive. Like you,monsieur. Uh, now, see here, miss, uh, the Sergeant and I have been having some words about you. Oh, you speak of me with Mike? - Yes. Now, here's what, uh-- - You like Mike? Like him? Oh, sure. I'm crazy about him. I too am crazy. First I hate this man and think to kill him. But then, he teach me to ride Harold so I do not kill this man, I love him. Is life, no? Is the way it goes. Um, speaking of going, there's a trading post called Maple Rock about 20 miles up river. There's some houses there and people and among them, a cousin of mine. How would you like to go live with her and learn to be a woman? I do not like. Like it or not that's where you're going in the morning. 'You'll like it fine at Maple Rock.' Grow your hair long, give you pretty clothes to wear. Make you over into a regular little lady. No! I will not be lady. I want to be just as free as the wind and the evergreen tree. Free like the rabbit that runs through the down. Not like a.. Turtle who live in a shell I hear you say You would want me to grow up in lady like way Maybe that's good for some girl that you see But not Rose Marie How would I look in a polka dot bonnet All prettied up like the ladies on stage Rather I sing as a bird on the wing And be showing fine feathers in cage No no no This life I love Where each mountain and stream are as peaceful as dove No one but me and the blue sky above I'm free to be free Ask the little whippoorwill sitting on the windowsill What he say if you not let him fly Ask the little bobolink Can I tell you what I think? He will tell to you same thing as I Ah ah ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah ah ah He will tell to you same thing as I He'll say that I want to be Just as free as the cloud floating over the sea Free as the ocean that rise up and swell Not so like bucket you chain to the well Free as the air with the rain in my face And with wind in my hair Riding along in the land that I love I'm free to Be free Please,monsieur.â–  I stay here, yes? No no. You leave for Maple Rock at nine in the morning. The Sergeant will go with you and see that you reach my cousin's. Too bad. She'd have made a great Mountie. Go get her. Yes, sir. We skip the bracelets this time. Oh, Mike! Mike, I have the great wish not to go to Maple Rock. Please, Mike. It's not my idea. No. No. It's the man with the face. Oh, Mike. I-I hate this man most happily. Well, what do you need to do about it? - Kill him. - Kill him? Sure. Is easy. I show him how I shoot the head at 50 paces but I do not shoot the head. I shoot the face.Voila. That's no way to talk about a man that just made you a present of a horse. You mean, Harold? He... give me Harold? Oh, then I do not kill this man. I only wound. M-Mike, y-you know, this man he think of me as woman? You do not think of me as woman, Mike. - Well, I, uh.. - Mike. Always you say, like father like son you and me, Mike, yes? Sure, but it's-it's not what I think, Rose Marie it's-it's what others think. Well, look, it-it's this way. You're, you're growing up. You have grown up and I guess I-I hadn't noticed. Noticed what? Well, uh, look, there there comes a time when-when all of a sudden the woman becomes, uh, interesting, see what I mean? No, I don't see nothing. Well, interesting to a... to a man. What man? Oh, no man in particular. Just-just any man. And all of a sudden I'm interesting to a man? Oh, yes. Yes you are. You are right. I am interesting. Sure you are. And, now that you're interesting you'll want to find that a man can be interesting too. Maybe, maybe some nights you'll be some place quite and peaceful up in the hills and-- What place, Mike? I don't know what place. Just any place. - Like, like this place? - Could be like this place. And you'll be there, the man will.. And all of a sudden, he'll realize how he feels about you and start to tell you about it. What will he tell, this man? There's lots of things a man can say about a girl like you. - If he felt that way about you. - Like how, Mike? Well, like for instance, he might say.. Oh sweet Rose Marie It's easy to see Why all who learn to know you love you You're gentle and kind Divinely designed Divinely designed? What is divinely designed, Mike? Well, it... it means that you got a good shape. But I do not have the shape at all. Maybe not in that drape. Dressed up the way you ought to be. You would be graceful as the pines above you There's an angel's breath beneath your soul There's a little devil in your eyes You're silly, but nice. More. Oh Rose Marie I love you I'm always dreaming of you No matter what I do I can't forget you Sometimes I wish that I had never met you And yet if I should lose you Would mean my very life to me Of all the queens that ever lived I choose you To rule me My Rose Marie Well, you see what I mean, that's what a man might say. When he does this, Mike? If he loves you. - Mike. - Hm. I think I go learn be woman after all. - Mike. - Hm. These thing you tell me about. - You ever say them to a woman? - No. Why you didn't, Mike? I've never been in love, that's why. Why you wasn't in love? Well, it's mighty complicated for a Mountie if he falls in love. First, you have to apply in writing to the inspector. Then you have to get an okay from Edmonton. Then they have to check with headquarters at Ottawa. - Marie, are you listening? - Oh, sure, Mike, I listen. What was I saying? You say, you going to write letter to someone named Edmonton Otto and then they're going to.. I don't know, Mike. I was telling you what a Mountie has to do to get married. - Yes, Mike. - First, he has to apply-- Oh, Mike. Mike, I have the great pain twice. - What pain? - Oh, here is hungry. Oh, and here... is sore. Well, with here... I can help you out. Ah! Where it's sore... you're on your own. Come on, bear up. We'll be in Maple Rock in time for supper. Wait here. Well,bonsoir,Malone. Nice evening. How are things with the law? - Let's have the gun, Duval. - Wait a minute, it's my gun. It was your gun. It's evidence now. Let's have it. Shooting a deer out of season and a hind at that it's thinking pretty low even for you, Duval. You know, the trouble with people like you is you always think the worst of people like me. - Tell it to the judge. - I think I did say that. Funny thing about people with honest faces you can always tell what they're gonna say before they say it. Now with me.. You don't want to hear what happened? I've got eyes. They only tell you the half of it. I'm listening. I shot the hind, I had to. It's neck was broken. - Who broke it? - A puma. Sprang down at it, out of the tree right there behind you. I fired at the puma and hit him. Anyway, he took off through the woods. The hind was done for. So I-I put it to sleep. It was a kind thing to do, wasn't it? There's no claw marks, no sign of mauling. I told you, the puma took off as soon as I fired. You're slipping, Duval. You tell them better than that as a rule. Yeah, I have a very rich imagination. - You see, the trouble with-- - Get up on the horse. Alright. Harold. Hold on. Harold, stop. Hold on. Stop, Harold. Eh! Harold. Oh,mille merci, monsieur. mille merci. That's alright. What sacred you? Mm, puma. How you say, a lion spring at him from the bushes. I got him, Mike. I killed the lion with the knife. - That's good. You alright? - Uh-huh. I told you, a puma. A deer-killing puma. I only wounded him, but you'll find my bullet. Two bullets in him now. Then I do not kill him? Well, you didn't do him any good. Alright, Duval. And thanks. Anytime, Malone. Anytime. - Au revoir, monsieur. - Au revoir, mademoiselle. Let's party, folks. Come on, follow me. Tonight the drinks are on the house. Tonight the drinks are on the house, everybody. - You know why? - Why? - You guess who's back in town? - Who? Barney McCorkle. Hold on there, hold on. He'll be over here in a minute. And let's give him a rousing welcome when he comes through those doors. Come on. For he's a jolly good fellow.. Put down now. Put down the law. For he's a jolly good fellow - Barney, you son of a gun. - No, no, don't speak. Don't say nothing. Let me remember you just this way always. - What, why? - Standing there so regal like. Your eyes like stagnant pools. Your dress sparkling like a mother lode in the moonlight. I do glitter kinda pretty, don't I? They get these here sickles from the salmon up in Bristol Bay. Look better on me than the darned face. I missed you, Girly. The thought of you depressing me during the day nagging me at night... and frustrating me at twilight. Barney, you romantic old cartoon. Now, please, please. The inspector sent me down here to restore law and order. Not for nol'amour toujours. I know that, you dope. I asked him to send you. - You? - Sure. Me and him's kiss and kin. But he said there was a desperate character down here. There is... me. After all it's spring. Well, what do you think about in spring? Getting out of my long underwear. That's what I like. Oh, God, come on. What'll you have? Make mine sulphur molasses, over the rocks. Here's a toast to the finest Mountie who ever mounted our mount. That blundering bloodhound, Barney McCorkle! Not so fast. Not so fast. Oh I'm on the trail I'm over hill and dale And I ride ride ride as only I can But oh the shame everybody knows my name I'm the Mountie who never got his man There's a killer at large The bugle sounds the charge To the saddles men and give a brave account But what remorse For I can't get on my horse I'm a Mountie who cannot even mount As I ride through every town and county Little boys yell look ma that's a Mountie My buddies mock me as I sally forth To you I'm a cockle of the Mounties To them I'm Chinook of the North I've been on the force even longer than my horse If you wonder why they've kept me here so long Though I can't track them through the snows I'm the only Mountie who knows That's right. Every word of the Mounties Marching Song For we march march march And we ride ride ride And we march and we ride against the foe It's a long long way to icy Hudson Bay So I don't think that I will go Well, you can laugh. Once I almost got the man. - Tell us about it, Barney. - Well.. It was the year of the Caribou famine. Saskatoon Dan was his name. He came from one of the Finger Lakes, so we called him Pinky. He was a mean treacheroushombre. Always saying things behind your back. Like stick 'em up. Now, Dan was stuck on a little Eskimo girl called Ungunga. One day, Dan had a little too much whale meat and went blubber happy. So, that night he snuck into Ungunga's igloo. But she repulsed him. Dan didn't care 'cause he was mighty repulsive too. Well, so, it seems Ungunga was sweet on another Eskimo called Fangalanga. So, in a fit of jealousy, Dan cut off her nose. You see, he didn't want her kissing anyone else. Yes, he cut off her nose and away he ran. So, they set me out to get Saskatoon Dan. So I march march march and I ride ride ride Looking for Saskatoon Dan I ain't looking for Chloe or Shanghai Lille I ain't looking for that little blue bird That lives on the hill Like a beguine that was never again I'm the Mountie who never got his man Or woman I'm the Mountie who never got his man Sarge! Sergeant, Sergeant. This is getting to be monotonous. - Barney. - Rosie. Ha ha. What are you doing here? Sir, doing a desperate character, Sarge, uh, sergeant. Barney! Ah, Inspector Appleby's compliments, Lady Jane. - Rose Marie. - Ah! This must be the young chick who wants to become a woman. That's right. But watch out for your fingers. Mike, it's not nice. I have not bite anyone for months. How's that? 'Bye, Mike.' Hey Sergeant, have a heart. We're getting all wore up picking up papers. That's going on every night now for two weeks. If you're having trouble, we'll be glad to help you. Very easy to write a letter. Think of what you wanna say. Get it into words, you know how to spell 'put it on paper and there's your letter.' Very helpful. But I have to know what I wanna say and how to spell it. It's just... getting started, it's tough. Well, that's easy, how about, "Dear sir." A sergeant writes a letter To make her love him better A lion when he's tracking down a killer He turns to jelly seeking words to thrill her Poor Mike our Mike a poet He's not well-versed in poetry 'Tis clear to see his manly heart is breaking Yes hemorrhaging Poor lover.. 'O-ow! What?' Oh, no. It ain't decent to go without a corset. Oh, Jane, I do everything like you say. I try like anything to be lady. - Is right? - Is right. Oh, then please, do not ask me to do this bad thing. Okay, chicken. You got all the right things in right places anyhow. How's it feel to be a real live feminine female? Kind of sassy, ain't it? I look like so at the dance tonight. You look like so at the dance. Kind a like the way I'd want my daughter to look.. ...if I had one. Well, guess now I do. - Oh, Jane. - Alright, alright now. Let's get organized. - You do the Quadrille with? - Arthur. - You do the Mazurka with? - Tom. - You poker the polka with? - Jonny Lan. And if you wanna get closer acquainted with a fella? I go like so with the handkerchief. And then... like so with the fan. You got it, chicken. Be the way I tell you. Look the way I fix you. May the tough and tall bust a gut going crazy for you. 'You'd best get some rest before the dance.' Jim, Jim Duval. - Bonjour,Jim.â–  - Bonjour, mademoiselle. You come to the dance.. Wanda. What are you trying to do? Start a forest fire? Still the same Wanda. Tell me, did you get yourself a husband since last spring? No? It was a cold winter, eh? Which one of the braves do you want? Maybe I can.. Me? Oh, no,cherie,no. I'm not the marrying kind. But thank you. Thank you for the offer. Oh, by the way, I brought you a present. - Fox. You like fox? - Mm. The best I trapped all year. Ha! soft eh? Now, there is a little business I'd like to talk over with the Chief. Suppose you show me to his tent, uh? Tell him Jim Duval is here. - You give? - That's right. Take back. You will not give to Indian. No. Sorry, Wanda. A man of your people and woman of mine to become good friends... not good. Easy, Chief. Easy. I'm here to see you not Wanda. That land of yours up this river the land we talked about last year, remember? You asked 400. - There she is. - This year 800. - Now, wait a minute. - 800. Look, I don't have 800. It took me a whole year to get this. Bring 800, land is yours. Alright. You'll get it. Thank you, Rose Marie. Thank you, Lady Jane. Well, chicken, if they're handing out the plumbers you would be graduating tonight. - I am woman now? - And a lot of cute one, too. You've done me proud. Oh, but, Jane, I do not feel like woman. I do not feel it here. How's that? I do quadrille with Arthur. I make mazurka with Tom. My polka with Johnny Lang. Poor Johnny. He look at me as if to die and I feel nothing. Oh, look. I can fix you up all grand and glory outside but inside, honey, that's up to you. I know. Jane, I am not woman. I do not have the love. Aw, you got the love, alright. You got a barrelful all stocked up and looking for some lucky Joe. - You think? - You betcha. You just haven't met him yet. The one who likes the few. Are you spoken for, ma'am? One, two. It's a very nice contribution. Yeah. Ought to bring $50. Rose Marie? - You think 50? - Yeah. Like they say we're mighty obligated for the use of the hall. It's a very nice night for me and I know it makes Jane very happy. Well, $400 in this kitty. Thank you. Just about what I need. But please, no talk. Turn around. Hands against the wall gently. Come on. Thank you. Now that you have what you want, why don't you leave? In a minute. First I... I want to hold you in my arms. And dance. This-this is a big joke you make. You know what, I'm afraid it is no joke. But it must be. You wouldn't take the money that the people paid for charity. - Charity? - It's true. It's for charity. No, not for charity. Your dance was worth the money. Hold up! Hold up! - Wah! - Hah! Ah! Oh, it is you, huh? At first, I thought it was Malone. You don't feel like the Sergeant. And I like it. I like it better if you put me down. I'm afraid to do that,cherie. Maybe you work for the Mounties now. So if I put you down, you will capture me. - I would not do that. - Oh, you wouldn't? Well, in that case, I'm very, very much relieved. Now, uh, tell me if you didn't come to capture me, why did you follow me? - I do not follow you. - Oh, I see. You just took a walk through the woods, huh? Why not? Why not? Specially, in the middle of the night. You take the money from the people, why? It was for a something I wanted very much. I gave it back. Why? The way you looked at me. What else could I do? You make the kiss with me. You made it back. I did not. You know a man knows when he's on his own and when he has company. It was very nice company. You like to kiss the boys, huh? Was the first kiss I make in all my life. Well, then,cherie you... you shouldn't be walking alone in the moonlight. What have, what have you done all your life? Driving, fishing. But now, Lady Jane teaches me to be a lady. To wear dresses and.. ...to behave with manners. You would not believe this, but I used to bite people. Oh, you laugh. To learn the right things is very important. How they teach you what it means to be in love? When it happens to me I will know. Will you,cherie? What's that? Jim, you heard it too? Yes. There's someone up there, calling. No, Jim, no one. Rose Marie, I'm a very practical man. When you hear a voice in the forest there is always someone there. Not always. If you hear a voice and no one is there then something is wrong here. Or here. You-you were not born in these mountains, Jim? No. Way up in the Yukon. Well, here it is different. Once there was an Indian girl who love Indian boy of different tribe. One day, his tribe go very far away across the mountains and she never see him again. But she love him for always. And so at night she call to him and the mountains carry the call. Was long, long time ago, but.. ...Indian say their spirits still live in the mountains. And if someone love someone, and call to him from far away the one she love will hear the call. Even today. Yes. I heard that story once. (Ann Blyth and Fernando Lamas singing "Indian Love Call") So echoes of sweet love notes Gently fall Through the forest stillness As found waiting Indian lover's Call When the lone lagoon Stirs in the spring Welcoming home some Swannee white wing When the maiden moon Riding the sky Gathers her star eyed dream Children nigh That is the time Of the moon and the year When love dreams To Indian maidens appear And this is the song That they hear When I'm calling you I will answer you That means I offer my love to you To be your own If you refuse me I will be blue And waiting all alone But if when you hear My love call ringing clear And I hear your answering echo So dear Then I will know Our love Will come true You'll belong to me I'll belong To You Now look, I'm certain there is gold on that land of yours up at Peace River. I wanna dig for it. Here's my idea. You give me the land free. I'll work it and give you one half of what comes out of it. No. Buy for 800. I don't even have 400 now. No money. No land. That's not a heart you've got. That's granite. I like to open up that tough red skin of yours and prove it. Bonjour,Malone. Nice day. How are things with the law? Well, they tell me that, uh Robin Hood was in town on Saturday. Robin Hood? Stole the people's money and then gave it back. How come he got so squeamish? Why ask me? Because it was you, Duval. I know it and you know it. There'll be no charge this time. Thank you for the warning, Sergeant. I'll-I'll bear it in mind. I'm not through yet, Duval. What I just said is official. But unofficially, just between you and me the next time you force yourself on a girl at the point of a gun-- Why, Sergeant. Why, you surprise me. Well.. Beneath the Mountie scarlet breast the bitter passion strong. To think they are the slips at breast the place where his belong. Right, Sergeant? Stay away from Rose Marie, Duval, stay clear away or.. You're a troublemaker, Duval. But even you don't want this much trouble. Good evening, Lady Jane. Socks and shoes, it's the law! - Is, uh, Marie in? - Sure is. Marie! Mike! Oh! Here. Let me take a look at you. Marie, you're.. ...you're beautiful. That's what I think too. Hah, kinda cute, eh? 'Ma'am, you did a great job.' Oh, Mike. You here is so wonderful. You miss me? Always I miss you, Mike. - How long you stay? - Well, uh, I don't. I'm on my way back right now. - Tonight? - Hmm. I've, uh... I've only got a minute. So listen real hard and don't interrupt. Uh.. Remember, me telling you what a Mountie has to go through if he wants to get married? All the letters he has to write applying to the inspector getting the okay from Edmonton and checking with Ottawa. - Remember? - Yes, sure, Mike. Well, I hate writing letters. But I'm gonna do it. You wish for to make the marriage with somebody, Mike? - Yeah. - Who do you wish to marry? You. Me? But, Mike like son, like father, you and me, Mike, yes? No. Like daughter? I am like daughter? No. Try again. You mean, you.. I mean... I wish to make the marriage with you. That's what I wish for, Marie, with... with all my heart. (Howard Keel singing "Rose Marie") Oh, Rose Marie, I love you I'm always dreaming of you No other love can ever be my true love No other love can fill my heart like your love Of all the dreams I long for No dearer dreams can come to me Than holding in my arms the one I long for I love you My Rose Marie But, Mike, I... I never think of you that way. I know. But try. Try real hard. Starting right now. I'll be back. Who died? He kissed me. Him too? Don't move. Jim, you crazy man. What you want? You. Come down. No. I busy. Busy? Busy with what? Uh... a letter. This is no night for letters. This is a night for.. Well, look at it. 'Come down.' No. Alright, then I'll come up. No, Jim, please. 'Jim!' 'I busy.' Go back. You hear those drums? You know what that is? Jim, please, you go now-- It's the Indian totem festival of summer. Oh, it's quite a sight. You're gonna like it. Now, let's see. Yes. You'll need a coat or something. That's it. Jim, I think you're absolutely the craziest man. It's a fine night but there'll be a breeze from the lake. - Are you ready? - No. No? Alright. Jim, put me down! I don't go nowhere! 'You hear me, Jim? Put me down.' Oh, pole that holds up the sky. Less than a shadow of an acorn am I. Oh, pole that holds up the sky. Smile down on your children with your painted eye. Jim, you crazy. Jim, oh, Jim, I'll lose the-- - Forget it. - Oh, Jim. Oh. - We had fun tonight, eh? - Oh, great fun, Jim. I always have fun with you. Then maybe you won't forget me when I'm gone. You go away? Why? You know how it is with a trapper. The beaver and the fox don't come to visit me. I'll miss you,cherie. I'll miss you very much. Well, then... why go away? There are many things a man could do here. No, no. Not a man like me. I-I just can't live in towns with people around and houses that shut me in. I-I can't. I can't travel the same road, day after day after day. I... I need new places. Places, uh... where I... maybe I'm the first man who ever drank from the stream or walked down the trail. That I like too. Very much I like. Do you like it enough to camp with me? You know how I feel about you. I love you. Well? Jim, I-I... I must think. Rose Marie... do you love me? Yes. Then what, what is there to think about? I must think if I love you enough. Well, we... we had a good time tonight anyway. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim. 'Jim.' When you come back? Next year or the year after or.. Or maybe never. You know how it is in the wild country. Take care of yourself, Jim. Come back. Promise. Who can promise these things? Au revoir, cherie. Jim. Jim. (Ann Blyth and Fernando Lamas singing "I Have The Love") Why do I feel so strangely? Never the same way twice Now I'm hot like furnace Now I'm cold like ice Suddenly it hit me Suddenly I know I've been kissed by sunshine And almost like April snow I have the love I have the feeling Inside of me It's warm like the summer time I realize I'm not wise, I'm not smart I only know What I know in my heart Now I have the dream I have the miracle So bright, all the stars grow dim Love She is wonderful Love She is beautiful I have the love For him I have the love I have the feeling Inside of me It's warm like the summer time I hear your name And the flame seems to start And when I bow There's a glow in my heart Now I have the dream I have the miracle A miracle now come true Love She's wonderful Love She's beautiful I have the love For you 'Jim, Jim.' What is it? What's the matter? Where do you make your first camp tomorrow? Golden Rock. I know where that is. Wait there until sundown. Oh, sure, yeah. I'll wait forever. But this is a very big decision for you to make. If you come with me, it will be for the rest of your life. If you don't, if you want me to go on alone.. ...at least send me away with the sound of your voice. Sing me the song the Indian girl sang to her brave across the mountains. I'll understand and I'll go off alone. I warn you stay away from white man. Stop it! Stop it! I gotta make my report. Leave everything the way it is. Don't touch anything. Whoever did it, we'll get 'em. 'The Indians are coming! 'The Indians! Clear the streets.' 'The Indians are coming.' 'Get the children off the streets.' Shirts and skirts, it's the law. Well, it's about time too. Them Injun's crazy as a cockroach marching to town, scaring folks to death. 'Mike.' Marie, uh, have you seen this before? Sure, Mike, when I killed a puma. It's Jim's knife, no? Mike, what happened? Red Indian Chief's been killed. - Killed? - Hmm. Have you seen Duval? Jim Duval maybe angry, but he's no killer. He and the Chief quarreled over some land and Jim threatened him. I heard that myself. And it's Jim's knife in the body. Mike, what... what happen to Jim if you find him? He'll hang. Mike, don't go. Please, listen to me. - I'll come with you. - It's no place for a woman. But he'll kill you. Now, don't you worry. I take a lot of killing. Mike! Where you goin'? Jim. Jim! Jim! Hello. Hello. 'Hello.' Hello. Ooooooo ooooooo ooooooo Ooooooo ooooooo ooooooo That means I offer my love to you To be your own If you refuse me I will be blue And waiting all alone But if when you hear My love call ringing clear And I hear your answering echo So dear Then I will know Our love Will come true You'll belong to me I'll belong To you 'Stop there!' Come on, Malone, do something fast. Somebody killed their Chief last night. - They think I did it. - Did you? No, I didn't. Better talk fast. Promise them something, anything. Only get me out of this. Nice work, Malone. Thanks. What did you promise them? Justice. The Crown versus James Duval. And I heard Duval say to the Chief "That's not a heart you've got, it's granite. I'd like to open up that tough red skin of yours and prove it." Have you ever seen this knife before? Yes. The day Jim Duval saved my life. And having been found guilty as charged. 'It is the sentence of this court' 'that you be hanged by the neck until dead.' 'And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.' Oh, I thought it was somebody. Guess I can't be too choosy now about my company. I didn't come here to bargain. - Just to see if-- - Sure, sure. Some more routine, eh? What do they want from me now? Just to see if there's anything I can do for you. You can get me out of here. I have nothing to do with that. Then we have nothing else to talk about. Any messages you'd like to send? Any letters you want to write? - Who to? - Family? - Got none. - Friends? - Them neither. - No girl? No. No girl. Had one, once. Even thought of getting married. She changed her mind. - No last request, then? - Yeah. Pass the salt. If, uh... you should think of anything.. I'll let you know. What you want done with your things? What things? You got my gun. You got my knife. My traps and clothes. Whoever picks 'em up can have 'em. No. Nothing to give and... no one to give 'em to. Ain't worth much, but somebody gave it to me. I thought it was pretty. - Whom should I give it to? - Who cares? Keep it to yourself. Leave me alone, will you? Put this with Duval's personal effects. I'll be at the hotel, if you want me. Well, this letter from Ottawa just came in for you. Well.. Congratulate me, Corporal. I can get married. Don't tell me. Tell her. I'm on my way. - Marie, what's the matter? - Don't touch me. Don't you hear the bell gallows? Tomorrow you kill a man. Marie, it's not me. I have nothing to do with it. I am not the judge, I am not the jury. - I don't make the laws. - He had a fair trial. Fair? Jim not kill Chief, but you hang him. I ask you, I beg you not to go after him. It's my job. I do not care about anything. About judge, about jury. When you love someone, you know about them. In my heart I know Jim did not do this. I smell orange blossoms. And do I hear the faint tingle of wedding bells, Sarge? Sergeant. When is the big day for you and Rosie? I didn't ask her? What's the matter? Losing your nerve? Now, if you need advice aboutl'amour toujours. - Let's skip it, Barney. - Alright, Sergeant. I'll check Duval's stuff for you. I'm not checking it. Trying to see if I can find something, anything.. ...to give Duval a stay of execution. Don't you agree with the verdict? I do. Rose Marie doesn't. What difference does it make to her if.. Oh! It's Duval and Rosie. Oh, I'm sorry, Mike. A knife, a gun, mummy bag and an Indian love ring. Funny how things turned out. Those rings are supposed to bring good luck and long life. Certainly didn't work in Duval's case. Maybe the girl that gave it to him just stopped loving him. Yeah. What did you say, Barney? She stopped loving him and his luck ran out. Maybe he fell in love with somebody else. She found out. Hey, you can't take Duval's ring. - Took it out for this. - Where are you going? You remember Jim Duval? He had a quarrel with the Chief, remember? An hour ago, I was with Jim when they put the rope around his neck. And then they asked him if he had anything to say before he died. And he looked at me and he said "Soldier go to Wanda. "And give her this for me. "Tell her that Jim Duval said for her to wear it... always. And that he loved her." There. He didn't want to die, Wanda. 'Cause like he said at the trial, he never did it. McCorkle, step forward. McCorkle! Constable McCorkle. In appreciation for your outstanding devotion to duty it gives me great pleasure to present you with this. - Another star? - Attention! And for your outstanding work in helping to solve a serious crime I have been authorized to promote you to... Sergeant. Dismissed. Hey, congratulations. What are you doing here? I wait. Didn't you know that Jim was released this morning? I know. And that he left town. I know that too. - I wait for you. - For me? - But last night you said-- - You saved Jim. You give him back his life. For this, I stay with you, if you wish me to. For this, I do whatever you tell me from now on. I see. It's all up to me then? Whatever you tell me, Mike, I will do. Well, then, let's get out of here. I wanna talk to you in private. I will get the horses. Uh, go upstairs and change your dress. You do not like me in this one? Sure, it's pretty. First time I ever saw you... in the canoe you were wearing buckskin. Do you remember? I got a letter from Ottawa. They said I can get married. Just like you say, Mike. But I've changed my mind. You... don't wish to make the marriage with me? I love you very much. But you weren't meant for town, house, discipline. Me, I don't mind standing at attention or taking orders. But you are happiest when you go with the wind. Some women need fancy hairdos and frilly dresses but you are not like that. But I told you, Mike, whatever you say I will do. I will live in a town. I will wear ladies clothes. I know, I know. When I'm calling you Go ahead, answer. He'll wait for you. I will answer you
