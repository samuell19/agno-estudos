- Good morning. - Morning, Alexis. Welcome to New Orleans, Grace. I can't believe you're working the day after flying in. You haven't even unpacked yet. Grace, are you ready? Absolutely. Why, thank you. Mmm. Mmm? - Is that bourbon? - You have a big day. Figured you could use a little lagniappe. A la... Who? It means a little something extra. - Like bourbon in your coffee. - Alexis! Relax, it's Cajun eggnog coffee. The strongest thing in there is the bourbon extract. Mm-hm. Cajun eggnog coffee. Definitely not in Kansas anymore. Kansas is just about the only place you haven't lived. Oh, not true. Not true. Remember, about five years ago, I did that renovation in Topeka. - Of course, you did. - Yes. Well, I'm glad I finally got you to New Orleans. For a little while anyway. Ah, I'm waiting to hear about this job in Toronto, so keep your fingers crossed. Of course you are. Oh, come on, you know me. I don't stay in one place for too long. The glamorous life of a freelance architect. Yes, ma'am. - Come on. - Okay. What ya looking at? My client just sent me these pictures of her family celebrating Christmas. Aw, it's so cute. I know. I always get these boring paint by number projects. And I am so excited to be doing a family home. Oh, what she do again? She's some praline mogul. You're working for Loretta Brown? You know who she is? Ah, she is only a New Orleans icon. Well, yes, she is the first Black woman to own her own confectionery shop in New Orleans. And I am redoing her family home for a lifetime of Christmases and pralines baking. Aw, a lifetime of Christmases. I get it. You know, you are really obsessed with Christmas. Hey, I can appreciate it, okay? You know, White Christmas was written by one of ours. What? A white person? - A Jewish person. - Okay. Hey, I know you like to do the whole solo Christmas thing. Yes, I do. I enjoy sitting on my couch in my pajamas, watching Christmas movies, eating those little peanut butter Santas and buying myself a ridiculously expensive gift that I don't need. By yourself? Yes, and I know it may sound sad to some people, but hey, I don't have to worry about anybody stealing my Christmas candy. Hey, you're coming to my Hanukkahmas party, right? It's the Friday before Christmas. - Hanukkahmas? - Mm-hm. Are you in? You know, I... I may have to work. Ugh, classic Grace Hill brush-off. I know it well. Everyone is not a social butterfly like you. Okay, well, it's kind of at the house, so may not have a choice. Are you serious? Sorry! Oh, come here, let's go this way. Right here, right here, right here. Just... just look normal. Oh, look at this tree. This is so nice. - Was that Anthony from college? - Yes. And we hid from him because why? Because I have a big day and I don't need any distractions. You had the biggest crush on him in college, so you would definitely be distracted. - No, I didn't. - Hmm. All right, maybe yes, I did. Just a little bit. What happened with you guys? Well, you know, we were in almost every class together and super competitive. However, I did think at the end of senior year, we maybe had a little romantic spark, but then my parents' accident happened and we just lost touch. - Yeah, that was a tough time. - Yeah. Man, I cannot believe it's been ten years since I've seen him. Really? He emailed me a couple of times, but I just didn't want to bother him with my family stuff, so... Then, after that, I went on my internship to London. And then moved to Frankfurt and okay, I see now. But I wouldn't worry about it. He'll probably never see you again. Famous last words. I got all these decorations. It's going to be so cute. And I am going to be FaceTiming with [indistinct], but with turkey, because... Oh, we're here. - 402, Barrack Street, right? - Yeah. Thank you so much for walking me the whole way. You want me to wait for you nearby? - Please. - Of course. Oh, and it's prah-line, not pray-line, trust me. - Prah-line, got it! - Okay. Okay. Oh, this is such a cute, little area. This house is so beautiful. It's perfect. Why would anyone want to renovate this? Grace Hill. Small world. Hey, how are you? Wow. Anthony Brown. Please. Uh... What a surprise. What are you, um, doing here? Surprise, huh? Because I'm pretty sure you saw me back there. That was you? What are you doing in New Orleans? Actually, I'm here for a small renovation gig. Really? That's great. Yeah. So, what are you doing around here? Getting inspiration or... No. No, this is my actual renovation gig. This house? - Yeah. - You sure? I mean, unless there's another 402 Barrack Street in New Orleans that I don't know about. I'm sorry. The reason I'm asking is because I'm doing the renovations on this house. - You? - Yeah. So, if I'm doing the renovations and you're doing the renovations, that means... Well, so come on. Our meeting was supposed to start a full minute ago. Get on in here. Oh, guess we'll be working together then. Yeah. Welcome to my home. It's so nice to meet you, Miss Grace, in person that is. Such a pleasure to meet you too, Miss Loretta. Oh, no, no. Everybody who walks through that door is family. And we hug them as family. Don't we, baby? Oh, baby. Baby, huh? Didn't he tell you that he's my grandson? Your grandson... Your grandso... This is... You're her grandson? Ever since I was born. Well, Miss Loretta, you didn't include him in any of the pictures that you sent me. You sent pictures? Grandma, can I speak to you, please? Of course. My darling, why don't you help yourself to some pralines in the living room? They're my specialty. - Thank you. - So good. I'm sure I don't know why are you looking at your grandma like that. You didn't tell me I was going to have a partner. Didn't I? Must have slipped my mind. Grandma, you are the smartest woman I've ever met. Nothing slips your mind. I thought you could use some help, that's all. And she seems like the perfect person to give it. For the record, I am capable of doing this on my own. And if I hate the designs you two come up with, you can. But right now, you have to at least try it with Grace. This is what I want. Okay, I'll try. I'll try. - Good. - Grace... she's a good architect. We're just very different. You know what they say about opposites, don't you? Oh, oh, oh. I'm so sorry. They are just so good. Of course. No one can resist a Miss Loretta treat. That's a praline promise. Why don't you and Anthony take a look around my house and start coming up with some ideas? Don't you want to brief us first? I'll be brief. Make the house look phenomenal. Okay. - Should we, uh... - Let's start upstairs. Oh, okay. So the house was built in 1888, and it hasn't been updated since the 1920s, so you can see how badly this reno is needed. The first thing I want to do is probably blow out these walls down here. Oh no, no, no, no. This is a beautiful, historic home. You can't just go blowing out walls. Well, up until a few minutes ago, we weren't doing anything, were we? Who got coal in his stocking? You're afraid of me stealing your spotlight, aren't you? Grace, no one's going to steal my spotlight. Oh, yeah, no one but me. It's just like old times. - Old times? - Mm-hm. Back when I used to beat you at everything. You think you could stop teasing me long enough for us to get some work done? Maybe when it's no longer fun. It's very mature. Listen, I've got to be honest with you, okay? This house, it needs to be nice. I'm talking next level here. And it is my family's house, so I'm kind of feeling like you should let me take the lead on this. Yeah, but your grandma hired me. And I heard that. But it is my family's legacy. And I was hired to do a job, and I'm going to do it. - Grace... - Okay, listen, Anthony. Why don't we pick this up tomorrow? I'm going to give you a little bit of time to get your mind right. That's the door, right? I'll be going this way. Just like old times. I mean, she has this beautiful home with these historic flourishes and he just wants to tear it all down. Can you believe that? What I can't believe is that you didn't introduce me to Miss Loretta. - I'm obsessed with her. - Not now, Alexis. Anthony really got under your skin. Do you know that he doesn't want to work with me? And you know, quite frankly, I'm not sure if I want to work with him right now, either. - He's just so... - Hot? - No, he's so... - Devastatingly handsome? No, he's... Better than any Christmas present Santa ever brought you? Alexis, stop. This is my dream job, Alexis. I just want to create a home for this family that is warm and loving and inviting. And he just wants to make it cold and unfeeling. I think you both want the same things. You're just going about it different ways. I don't know about that. Try to stick it out. Help him see your point of view. Who knows? Maybe you could learn something from him too. Ha! That would be a miracle. And what better time for a miracle than the holidays? Oh, my goodness. - I'm here to pull... - Okay, I'm pulling. Can't believe y'all still haven't decorated this tree yet. It's kind of hard to do when the guy who's, you know, best at untangling lights is always working. Chris, you keep this up, he might never leave the office again. Thank you, Mom. But he is right, you know. You too? Anthony, we have not seen you since Thanksgiving. You always hold up in that workplace of yours. Yeah, because I'm trying to build something great, like Grandma did. And I got some new ideas, too. Yeah, like your scheme with the shop. No, that's... that's not a scheme. That's a plan. One day that stubborn of a woman is going to let me do it, too. Look, if we modernized the shop, gave her some bells and whistles, she wouldn't have to work so hard. Hey, man, I'm with you. I would love some new bells and whistles at the shop myself. - Thank you. - Dope, man. Anthony, you know your grandmother. The old ways are the best. Mm-hm. But, uh... it's about that girl, though, isn't it? The one grandma hired. Which girl? Anthony? What girl? You got a big mouth. Mom, I don't have time for some setup, I got to focus on this redesign. Grace is just another architect that grandma hired, okay? Let me talk about the shop. Let's keep it at the shop, okay? Well, if it's so important to you, why don't you show your grandmother that you respect the old traditions? Meaning? What if... What if you made her pralines from scratch? - Oh, Grandma's pralines. - Mm-hm. - The secret pralines? - Mm-hm. The secret recipe that only Grandma and one other person at the shop knows about? I didn't say it was going to be easy. It's not. But if you want things to change, it... It might not be a bad idea if you show her that you know where it all started, huh? Oh, I got to get to the store. Here. - Who's working too hard now? - Only be a minute. Mom, would you let me know if Daryl dropped off that last stack of pralines, please? Yeah, folks need to get those by Christmas. Yes, they do. Remember what happened last Christmas? You got 20 bags of pralines at the store stocked up? Yeah, and then we had to go door-to-door on Christmas Eve. That hurt that boy. You know Daryl, right? Not really. If he forgets another stack of pralines, there will be no more Daryl. Oh, calm down, Mr. Boss Man. - Give me a kiss. - Mwah. Give me a kiss. Bye. You got a big mouth. Don't worry man, I won't tell her. Won't tell her what? That Grace Hill is the girl who you had a crush on in college. - Hey, hey, man, keep it down. - What is the problem? I don't want Grandma to hear. You know she'll meddle. - Grandma already knows. - What? Yeah, I told her when I saw Grace in your alumni magazine. Why else do you think she brought her here? Well, I don't have time for some setup, all right? I just want to focus on this redesign. Yeah, and I'm gonna let you handle that. But I am going to ask you one last time, just so you don't forget because it's very important. Yes, I will pick Charlene up from the airport. - On time. - On time. - No work emergencies. - Chris. Just asking. And keep it quiet, it's supposed to be a surprise for Jordan. Hey, I got this. This will be a Christmas our family will never forget. Inspiration, inspiration, I just need a little bit of inspiration. Mm-hm. - Excuse me, Miss? - Hi, yes. - Can I ask you a question? - Um, okay. Okay. Well, it's not so much a question as a comment. My teacher says I'm supposed to say it when I have a comment instead of a question. Okay. I think you forgot all the people in your picture. You know what? You are absolutely right. So could you help me out and draw some for me, please? Hey, Jordan. Please don't bother this lady. Hey, Uncle Anthony. I can't seem to get rid of you, can I? I'm sorry, is she bothering you? Absolutely not. I'm getting an art lesson from my new assistant. At least someone in your family appreciates historic design. That's very funny. Hey, Jordan, you remember we talked about not talking to strangers? We aren't strangers. This is, um... - Grace. - Yeah, this is Grace. And I'm painting her picture. She forgot the people and the Christmas trees. There aren't any Christmas trees, Jordan. It's a Christmas picture. It needs Christmas trees. Yeah, Uncle Anthony, where is your imagination? Well, my architectural table's mighty cozy. Have you come up with any designs yet? Oh yeah. - Nice. - If you're looking for a Christmas-themed house from the 1800s. Have these two been bothering you? Well, Jordan, your great-granddaughter here, has been an absolute delight. Your grandson, on the other hand... Did you hire her just to have somebody else to pick at me? Grace, don't pay him any mind. The boy's been working mighty hard. Jordan's mom, Charlene, is in Turkey, so we're all helping out while her dad goes shopping for some G-I-F-T-S. Grandma, you know I can spell. I know you can. - So, Turkey? - She's in the Marines. Wow, your mama sounds pretty awesome. Yeah, I miss her, though. - I wish she were here. - Yeah. Can you come to lunch, Grace? Oh. That's a great idea, Jordan. Grace, I made a sweet potato pie with a praline topping. Can't even get one of those in my shop. Family only, honey. I... I'd hate to intrude. Oh, Grandma always says that family is who you choose. If you pick us, then you can come. Hey Grace, don't feel like you are obligated to. Sure, I'd love to come. Come on. Okay, so you like art, sweetheart? You know, some people might say it's fate, her being here today. Yeah? Some people might say she's got a very good guidebook. You'll never get your work done talking like that. If you keep sniping at her, she's going to leave. So, I think you should try another approach. Okay, well, what approach do you suggest, Grandma? Opening your pretty heart. Big talk coming from a woman who's been single for 25 years. I know you didn't just go there. Let me say something to you. I've been working for 30 years. Taking care of my business and my family, on my own. Come on, Grandma, you know I didn't mean it like that. Okay, let me tell you what we can do. If you open your heart, I'll open mine. But it's your move first, Boo. Okay, I'll try. You'll what? Try? Try what? You better do the darn thing. Talkin' 'bout "try." Hi, Mr. Anthony. Oh, hi, Rose. I love that dress. Oh, you're pretty popular. That's just how New Orleans is. You know, you can't swing an ornament in this town without hitting somebody you know. Oh, I am just surprised that you have gotten out long enough to meet somebody. You were very serious in college. Yeah, I know I... I've been very intense and I am sorry. Wow. Christmas really is the time for miracles. How about a fresh start? Okay, but how do I know you're not going to run out before the job's done? I heard you've been all over the world. Oh, have you been checking up on me? Social media. Ah, you have been checking up on me. Well, I've been to London and Paris, New York, Frankfurt. I do really love traveling. But I have to say, seeing you with your family and your grandmother's house has made me a little bit jealous. - I don't know. Traveling all over the world doesn't sound that bad. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere until at least I finish your grandmother's house, okay? Oh, my goodness, decorations. You know, this is my first time on a streetcar. - Really? - Yes, and it is exhilarating. I don't think I've ever heard anybody use that word for a streetcar before. You could jog faster than this thing goes. No, but there's just something... just charming about this old-school feel. It's, you know, kind of romantic. My grandfather used to tell me this story about a guy who won the love of his life on a streetcar. Oh. Yeah, apparently she was into animals. So, he filled the streetcar with animals from the Audubon Zoo and drove it to her house. Oh. Still think it's romantic? I mean, it's got potential. - You okay? - Huh? It, um, sounds like you have a pretty big family, huh? Yeah, but don't worry. They're all a lot nicer than I am. Hm. Well, I haven't been to a family thing since... um, I'm just feeling nervous. Well, don't. None of my family's cooking's that bad. Unless my brother made potato salad. Oh, they're here! They're here! - Hi. - Hi. Oh, hi! You must be Grace. Yeah. I met you at the graduation, - I'm Anthony's mom, Tina. - It's so nice to see you again. I'm just stopping by for a second. - Oh, no, no, you just got here. - Oh, no. Come on in. There is plenty of food for everybody. Right, and I hope my brother's not giving you too much trouble. Oh, no, I'm not worried about her, I know she can stick it right back to him. All right, family. Let's all take hands and say grace. - Grace? - Hmm? Would you like to do the honors? Oh, I'm... I'm just a guest. I... I couldn't... You sit at this table, baby, and you're family. Family? Oh, um, but... but I, um... Oh, you know what, hold on... Is that my phone? I'm sorry. Oh, I am so sorry, I really have to take this call. - Is it... - No worries, yeah, We'll be fine. Go and take the call. Thank you. Architects, right? They're always so busy. Yeah. Um, that call's probably going to take a while. So, Jordan, you want to say grace? Okay. I can't do this. All right. And somebody in. Blessing them to have the ability to make this food, Lord, please bless the hands. Thank you for working and providing and blessings... What's up? How they treatin' you out there today? Loretta Brown, there she is. Marcel LeRay, is that you? It's me. I read so much about this place, I thought now that I'm here, I should give it a visit. Come and give me a hug. - It's been years. - Yes. Chris, could you make him a plate? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. Let's catch up. - I'd like that. - Okay. I've been getting a little lonesome since I've been here. Figured I should reconnect with the people I grew up with. Haven't been able to find many of the old gang. I mean, probably wouldn't recognize me now anyway. I recognized you, didn't I? Well, because you have an eye for beauty. Oh, maybe the faces change, but you're still one arrogant old man. You know, if I recall, I also had an eye for beauty. So tell me, what are your plans for Christmas? Well, I'll probably buy a big, old roast beef po' boy and watch a game. That's no way to spend Christmas. My family's having a big party on the 23rd. You should come. Pass a good time with some good people. - I would be honored. - Good. - Then, it's a date. - A date? Don't get it twisted, honey. I'm a little rusty, but yes, a date. - I have one question. - Mm-hm. Will there be any gumbo at this party? I have been craving me some gumbo. Oh, there will be gumbo. Last night, I started my test batch, and it's currently sitting on my stove for taste testing. - That so? - Mm-hm. It is. If you'd like, you can come over and give it a try. Wait a minute. Are you inviting me on our second date before we have the first date? Let's take it one date at a time, okay? Okay. Okay. Miss Loretta, I'm just so sorry that I walked out on lunch yesterday. And I just... I just have to explain that, um... Grace? Hey, Anthony. - Hey. - Hey. It is so good to see you. I wanted to apologize. I'm... I'm sorry that I left early yesterday. No, that's okay. Uncle Anthony says that you're a great architect, and sometimes great architects have to take important calls. Oh, yes, so I'm a great architect, huh? Hey, Jordan, why don't you go ahead and go inside, okay? Wait for me, all right? - We missed you yesterday. - Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry. You know, obviously I've... I've said grace before, but everything was just a little bit, um... Overwhelming? - Yeah. - Yeah. I just... I was just so afraid to mess up. And I'm not really that good at being put on the spot. It's hard for me. It's okay. You know, my brother, Christopher, he, uh, he's been trying to get out of saying grace for years. He usually just stumbles and mumbles along until I say "amen" to put him out of his misery. It's fine. Honestly, the truth is that, um... I haven't gotten to do this whole... Whole family thing since... Since I lost my parents. Being around your family and all of this love, it... made me realize how much I missed my family. Yeah, I get it. My grandfather died when I was ten. My parents split after that. My dad moved to Atlanta, and I just... Well, I just think you have to love who you got, while you got 'em. Mm. So, is that why you work 24/7 and don't make time for your family? I mean, I'm just saying, people do talk. I love my family more than anything. They're the reason I work so hard. Anthony, they don't care about how much money you make or how big of a business you build. Wow. You know, I came here for pralines and now I'm getting read. - Okay. Well, I guess, we both have something to learn, right? You want to come inside with me? Grab a snack? - I'm not intruding... - No. Are you okay with me tagging along? Yeah. Yeah. You know, in fact... I think you might be able to help me. With what? Are you sure this is a good idea? I need my grandma's secret recipe. But why? I have something to prove, and I never lose a bet. Once I get this place updated, Loretta's will be a household name. - Why are you not standing watch? - I see her out there having coffee with someone. Don't worry. It's just a praline recipe. Just a praline recipe. You are clearly not from around here. - Oh! - Oh, you did it. Yeah. What? All right, now feast your eyes on this. Look at the note! You think that's funny, don't you? Oh, it's funny. Did you think your mama wasn't going to tell me about your little praline plan? Hey, Grandma. Don't you "Grandma" me. If you want to modernize this place, you have to figure that out all on your own. Grandma, I've been trying, it's just... - Can you give me a hint? - A hint. I'm a manager here. She ain't give me a hint yet. You want a hint? Take a hint and get out of here. - Oh. - Okay. - Come on. Let's go. - Okay. Let's go. I know when I'm beat. Mm-mm-mm. - Um, hi, Miss, Loretta. - Yes, honey? I'm really sorry about yesterday. There's nothing to be sorry for. No, no. I... I shouldn't have run out the way that I did. Honey, when I met you, I could see something in your eyes I used to see in my own. - What's that? - Loneliness. When I lost my husband, Anthony's grandfather, I felt it, too. But having my family helped me get through it. So, if you ever want a little bit of family and if you're ever ready to open your heart and let some other people love you again, just know that this door is always open. - Thank you. - No problem, baby. So, have you had a tour of the city yet? Not yet. Because I happen to know a fabulous tour guide. I'm sure you do. Another thing to notice as we move through the city is that much of the architecture you're seeing isn't even French. Oh. You know, French Quarter is kind of a misnomer because most of the city... Burned down and was rebuilt by the Spanish colonists. Okay, listen, Anthony, I know all of textbook New Orleans. Why don't you show me your New Orleans? My New Orleans? - Okay, let's go. - Okay. Where are you taking me? You'll see. Oh, my goodness, this is beautiful. Anthony! Oh, what are you doing here? I thought you were too busy with work to come by today? - Hi. - Oh, we're working. Yeah, we're just doing some city research getting ready to draft plans for Grandma's house. Now, if you really want to learn your way around the city, there's no better way than the Jingle Bell Hop. - Jingle Bell Hop? - It's nothing. It's only the best way to experience New Orleans at Christmas. But you have to go by teams. Well, I mean, if it's the best way to see the city... Mm-hmm. Yeah, Grandma put you up to this? No, you know, I'm helpless against your grandmother. Come on, let's get you two signed up. All right, everyone, welcome, welcome. Thank you so much for coming for the Jingle Bell Hop. Yeah. Whoo! Let me tell you about the rules. They're pretty simple. All around downtown, locations are marked with a Jingle Bell Hop wreath. And at each location, there is a challenge. And if you succeed in that challenge, you win a bell! And the first team that returns here with the most bells, wins. Okay, so what exactly does the winner get? Only the best prize of all. - Hm? - Bragging rights. All right, everyone, on your marks. Get set. Yay! Oh, my goodness, the detail on these buildings is incredible. - Yeah, some other time. - What? You were talking about work? What? I got the pearl, I got the pearl. We got the pearl. Yeah! Yay! Whoa! I found it! I found it! You know, I still remember the day you screamed because you thought this little lizard was an alligator. Oh, you weren't any better. That was the day your hair started turning white. Oh. We had some good times back in the day, didn't we? Yeah. And the good times aren't over yet. You're right. I'm going to a Christmas pageant today. Would you like to join me? Well, let me check my calendar. Baby, you know you don't have no calendar. - Hush up and try this. - Okay. Mmm! You weren't wrong. This is some of the best gumbo I've ever had. Mm-hmm. Well, I know it's good gumbo. But don't you go falling in love with me. We haven't had our first date yet. Well, let's get this party started. Okay. Oh, all right, you guys, you're the first ones to arrive. Oh, wait, in order to win the final and most coveted bell, you must find the beautiful fleur de lis on this tree. That's going to be like a hundred... Well, 304, to be exact. One for every year since New Orleans was founded. - Go, go, go. Get going. - Okay. You know, others can't be far behind you. I'll take this one. This one here. This one? Oh, my goodness, this is the most fun that I have had in such a long time. What, what, what? Oh! I can't reach it. Oh, okay, hang on, hang on, I got you. Ooh! Um... We found it! We found it! Ladies and gentlemen, with all of the bells and the final one. The winners this year are Grace and Anthony. Yes! Thank you! Good job, son. Yeah. So, you said this was the most fun you've had in a long time. Don't let it go to your head. Too late. - So... - So, uh... - Oh, is it that time? - What? What time? I, uh... I told Jordan I'd go to her Christmas pageant. Oh. - Would you want to come with me? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. I mean, we got to show our bells off somewhere, right? Yes, we do. Okay, let's go. Okay, I'll follow you. Anthony, you okay? - Yeah, why? - You look nervous. Dancing and prancing like one of Santa's reindeer. So, you got jokes tonight. Well, I could talk about your bad design aesthetic if you want me to. Please don't. You're reminding me I got to get back and work on that redesign. Tonight is about Jordan. She's going to be so happy that you are here. I hope so. Is that my grandma? Who is she with? I don't know, but he is handsome and she is looking very happy. Unbelievable. It's only been a day, she's already got a man. Listen, be nice, okay? And I'm going to go get in the hot cocoa line. You want some? I think I'll need something stronger than cocoa. I'll see what I can do. Oh, thanks. - Hey. - Hi. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, Grace, what's up? Hey, um, did I catch you at a bad time? Can you talk? Are you all right? Yes, I'm at a Christmas pageant. With Anthony? Uh, sounds romantic. Dish, please. No, no, no, no. There is nothing to dish. Right. Lots of architectural drafting to be done at a Christmas pageant, I'm sure. Okay, just... just... Just listen, please. So yesterday, I completely embarrassed myself in front of his whole family. We're still not seeing eye to eye on this project, and for some reason, everyone is being so nice to me. I don't know. It's just... It's just this weird feeling, like I might actually belong here. And that can't happen because I'm so close to getting this Toronto job, and I haven't felt like this in so long. Well, first of all, enjoy it. Second of all, you never know what everyone is thinking. I remember... Alexis, hold on one sec. Actually, let me give you a call back, okay? But don't you wanna hear the rest of my speech? I'll call you later. All right, bye. Oh. I give great advice. Hey. I heard you back here and thought I'd come wish you luck. What's going on? Did they send you back here to try to make me go up there? No, but why don't you want to sing? Can I tell you something? And you promise you won't tell any other grown-ups? I promise. Pinky promise. There's a lot of people out there. I just wish mom was here to sing, too. Can you keep a secret for me? I completely understand. Because I feel the same way. - Really? - Mm-hm. Do you know what makes you so incredibly special? What? Even though your mom isn't here, you have a whole family of people who are out in the audience waiting to cheer you on and loves you. You know what? They don't care if you forget the words or if your voice cracks. None of that matters to them. Come on, I'll walk you out. Oh, you've got this. You got this, you hear me? So, where's your colleague? Shouldn't you be worried about your boyfriend? He is not my boyfriend. Not yet. Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome, everybody, to our annual Christmas pageant. I know you're excited to get into the holiday spirit, so I will go ahead and introduce our first number sung by Jordan Brown! Go. Me? Please? Okay. I don't have the words. It's okay. Let's do this. ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪ ♪ Peace on Earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪ ♪ Joyful, all ye nations, rise ♪ ♪ Join the triumph of the skies ♪ ♪ With angelic host proclaim ♪ ♪ Christ is born in Bethlehem ♪ ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪ All right, I think I figured out Grandma's recipe. These are the best ones right here. Uh, are you sure? Because, listen, I'm still full from your grandmother's jambalaya. - I can really sit this one out... - Grace, stop making excuses. Eat the praline. Ready? Three, two... Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. That is awful. Oh my goodness, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but it is... The worst thing I ever tasted in my life. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I mean, what are pralines? They're sugar, they're butter, they're... Apparently, burnt pecans. - Funny. - Well, listen, let's look at the bright side, okay? At least you decided to be an architect, and not a candy maker. - Ha-ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha. Speaking of which, let's see what you got here. - Wait, Grace. - Yes. What did you do with my beautiful house design? Okay, look, you are not going to put concrete finishes in this house. I'm not going to allow it. I don't know. You're impossible. Anthony, your grandmother is a New Orleans icon, and we have to give her an iconic New Orleans home. Yeah, but this New Orleans is the 21st century, not the Dark Ages. New Orleans is a melting pot, right? - Yeah. - Exactly. And we have to give your grandmother a home that reflects that melting pot. A little bit of French, a little bit of Haitian. The warmth of reclaimed wood with modern metal. It's classic meets modern. - That could work. - Good. Because when I talked to your grandmother, she said her dream was to have a house that generations could come and spend Christmas. And we can give her that. Okay, well, what about you? - Me? - Yeah. What about your Christmas? - My Christmas? - Yeah. Like, we spend so much time talking about me and my family, our traditions. But you have some traditions, I'm sure. Okay, yeah, we're not here to talk about me. We're doing this project for your family, so let's get back to work. Grace, you can share. It's okay. Okay, either you start talking, or you start eating. Okay, anything but that. They're not that bad. Fine. When I was a little girl, me and my parents, we would go outside, and we would make snow angels. And, um, I know it sounds so silly, but to this day, when I'm really missing them, that's exactly what I do. I go outside and make snow angels, and it instantly feels like Christmas. I know it's impossible here in New Orleans, but, um... I would give anything... to make snow angels with them one more time. Well, hey, it is the city of New Orleans, right? Anything's possible. - Even snow? - Maybe. Let's get back to work. All right. Now show me what you're thinking. I gotta get this. Here we go. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. I don't know what went wrong. The... the recipe online said... Online? Well, that's your problem. Miss Loretta's recipe is five generations old. I had to start from somewhere, Ma. I definitely wouldn't give that to your girlfriend. - Mm-mm. - She's not my girlfriend. That's not what Christopher's saying. Well, she won't be your girlfriend, not with that attitude. - Okay, who sent these? - Anthony. I thought we talked about you opening yourself up. I tried to. But just hanging around her, it brings up these feelings that... Feelings? Feelings. Mm. Like what, son? Weren't we talking about Grandma and her flowers? Your mother's not going to fall for that, boo. Did Marcel send these? As a matter of fact, he did. Not that that's any of your business. We're talking about Anthony and Grace. Oh. Probably wouldn't work anyway. She says New Orleans is growing on her, but she's always moving. Then you need to give her a reason to stay. - A reason to stay? - Mm-hmm. You have to show people how you feel, Anthony. You tell us all the time that you love us, but when was the last time you actually spent time with us? What she's trying to say, son, is that if you'd like her to feel like she belongs here, like she could stay, then you need to prove it to her. Exactly. And please don't go baking your feelings, because we all know you can't cook. No. Uh-uh. Ooh. Mm. Did you want to try one of these? - Oh, no. - I'm good. Mm-mm. There's a little step down. If I... If you let me run into something. Okay, where are we going? - Just trust me. - Please don't let me fall. - I got you. - Oh, this feels shaky. Okay, one more step. - It's kind of a big one. - Okay. Just one more after that, just one more. - Oh, my goodness. - Okay. - Okay, where are we going? - Just walk further. - How much further? - Almost there. How much? Oh, wait, this feels weird. This is a change, change, change? - Uh-huh. - What's this under my feet? - What's happening? - You're gonna sit right there. - What am I walking on? - Okay. You're gonna find out... All right. No, no. Right about... - Now. - Oh! I couldn't get a miracle, but I could get you a whole bunch of fake snow. - How did you... Called in a few favors. Stuff was on a Mardi Gras float last year. You did all of this, all of this for me? Yeah. Grace, you said you wanted to make snow angels. It's the least I could do. Come on, you got to make one with me. - Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Oh, this was for you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. - Okay. - Okay, lay back. - All right. - Lay back. Okay. I've never done this before, so don't judge my form. Nobody's judging you. That's some interesting form, though. You know how you were saying, um, you were starting to feel like you wanted to belong somewhere? Do you think you could want to belong here, like in New Orleans? - Maybe. - Yeah? I just... I don't know how to do that. Well, my grandma always says that if you want to do anything, you need... To practice. Yes, I heard. Um... You know, I have a question for you. Shoot. Do you want to come to this party with me? Really? Yeah. I mean, it's not every day that a guy makes it snow for you in New Orleans. I'd love to. Good. Well, I do have one last question for you. This is absolutely beautiful. Um... Do you expect me to help you clean all this up? Because if so, we probably need to start now if we want to be done by New Year's. No, I think we can enjoy it a little bit longer. Perfect answer. Hey, y'all, it's Christmas! Ha! - ♪ I celebrate Christmas - ♪ Christmas ♪ ♪ It's the best time of the year ♪ ♪ Sure, there's just the cheer ♪ ♪ Everyone that celebrates it's Christmas ♪ ♪ Christmas ♪ ♪ Snow is falling down ♪ ♪ Santa's coming to town ♪ ♪ Everyone, let's celebrate ♪ ♪ Let's celebrate the good times ♪ I know you're an introvert, but are you ever going to leave the kitchen? - I'm helping. - Is he here yet? - Oh, honey, you need a drink. Maybe I shouldn't have invited him. You really like him, don't you? I really do. Well, then come on. You want to be in the middle of the action when he shows up. - Okay. - Yeah. Thank you. I think people like being outside. Looks like your date finally got here. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry, I'm late, but I brought pralines. - Thanks, um... - It's the tie, right? - Too much, isn't it? - You look all right. Yes. He looks beautiful, she looks beautiful. Hey, Alexis. Oh, hey. You haven't changed a bit since college. Oh, you are still a charmer, and I love it. Now, come on. Join the party. Let's get drinks! All right now, be careful, because she has rigged this whole party with mistletoe. We wouldn't want to, uh, fall into one of her traps, would we? Yeah, we, uh, can't have that. Oh, yes, I'm glad you asked. Hey, everyone, I brought some of my grandma's pralines. Oh. - Dig in. - Mmm. Come on. Are you sure they're Miss Loretta's? Did you tell her? - I didn't say anything. - Sounds like you told her. I mean, the taste isn't going to lie. Let me see. Mm. Looks like you're going to have to keep trying. I'm just can't seem to figure out what I'm missing. ♪ Holiday glow ♪ Attention, everyone! Come here, please. As the host of a multi-faith melting pot holiday party, I obviously appreciate all religions. So my office is having a benefit where for every letter for Santa they receive, they'll be donating $1 to charity. - I have one. - Oh. We have our first letter. Thank you, Grace. Before the night is over, I want everyone here to write one letter to Santa. And at the end of the night, we'll pick the best one to be crowned King... or Queen of the holidays. Make them funny. Make them sweet. But don't make me cry. Okay. You know, I almost forgot Alexis is, uh... The best? Yeah. This is why you two get along so well. You know what? You, sir, need to write a letter to Santa. Mm-hm. ♪ Christmas wish ♪ - I think that's enough, right? - Yeah. Okay. I feel it! Yeah. Come on, Anthony, you've been hiding this for years. Let's... just tell the truth. - So, what you writing? - Hey, hey, no cheating! There's no cheating in letters to Santa. It is when the prize is being crowned King of the holidays. But don't you worry, I'll be a fair and just ruler. Come on, let me see, let me see. You can't use your height against me. All's fair in love and war, Grace. You'll see that once you recognize me as Christmas King. Well, what is this? Is it love or is it war? Can we go somewhere and talk privately? Oh, is that a command from the Christmas King? How could I refuse? Come on. What is this, um, Christmas emergency? Um... Well... I wanted you to read my letter before anyone else did. What? You giving me the advantage? That's not like you. Yeah, I'm not so good with words sometimes, and I wanted to get your feedback. You need to give yourself more credit. You are a brilliant architect and a good man, and a pretty good Bell Hop partner. Okay. Ahem. "Dear Santa, this might sound like an unusual request, "but there's only one thing on my list this year... One dream you could help me make come true. I'd like for this one woman to feel about me the way I felt about her since the first moment I laid eyes on her all those years ago in Dr. Carp's freshman lectures. Um... The way I felt about her since she walked into my life again a few days ago. All I want for Christmas this year is Grace Hill." Is this true? Do you mean this? Every word. I wanted to tell you back in college, but it was just not the right time. I had feelings for you too, back then. And I still do. Really? Yeah, and, uh... Looks like we're under the mistletoe. - Good? - Good. Great. Is that a second line? - We've got to go. We should go. - Okay, let's go. Okay. Remember when I said the Jingle Bell Hop was the most fun I'd ever had? - Yeah. - Yeah, that was back then. This is the most fun I've ever had. Oh, good, because it is only going to get better from here on out. - Really? - Yeah. Come on! Okay! Sorry. We're getting ready to close up. So early? I need to get my praline fix on. Marcel! Now, you've been every day. There's no way that you've gone through all those pralines by yourself. Of course not. I've been giving them away as gifts. - You must have a lot of friends. - Well, you know, New neighbors. I'm trying to make an impression. Mm, looking for your usual? Well, since you'll be closed for Christmas, we should double that. That'll just about clean me out. - There you go. - I'll take it. Thank you. Marcel, what are you really doing here? You can't have this many neighbors. I know that. You could always see right through me. You know, I... I like talking to you, I like seeing you, so I've been getting all these pralines and giving them out to shelters for the holidays. I just use it as an excuse to swing by and see you. You never need an excuse to come and see me. Really? I've been out of the game so long I forgot how to play it. Well, we'll just have to figure that out together then. But I do know where to start. Yeah? Well, are you going to kiss me or what? Ooh, my, my, my. They're right. - Right about what? - Things do get better with age. Oh, yeah. All right. Look out now. Got you. I'm glad my massive shoe closet is helpful to someone. Oh, my goodness, it's endless. You know, I really don't think it's fair that you're going to fancy French Quarter party and I have to say here, eating leftovers all by myself. You sound so sad. I suppose we've got leftover booze too. A-ha! Oh, my God, that dress is incredible! Thank you, thank you, thank you. I mean, keep my shoes out of the puddles on Bourbon, but honestly, you can do whatever you want. Oh, you know, I just... I really, I really want to look beautiful. Anthony's whole family is going to be there, and I just, I want to fit in. You and Anthony looked pretty cozy last night. But this time his whole family is going to be there. You know, sometimes family isn't the people we're born into. It's the people we pick, and they're going to pick you just like I did. Now you know I don't do all that mushy stuff. Oh, I know. I love you, too. You don't have to say it. I feel it. Now, go get dressed. Listen, please make sure you don't eat all the challah while I'm gone. - No promises. Okay. Oh, hold on. What's wrong? I, um, I just got a text. The Toronto job is a go. Well, what are you going to do? I don't know. So, is Grace going to be here tonight? I need a new dance partner since Dad is always stepping on my feet. Yes, uh... [laughs] yes. Yes, she is going to be there tonight. That's why your uncle can't stop taking measurements of the door frame. Actually, he's got a very important errand to run. - And then a party to get to. - Mm-hmm. You can't miss the family picture. Oh, he won't. No, he won't. 'Cause everyone will be there. What's that? Nothing. Just talking about your date tonight. The only date anyone should be talking about up in here is mine. You know, Grandma, you are absolutely right. - You look beautiful. - Hm, thank you. Ooh, I have to run. My date is here. He better be good to you tonight. Don't worry, he'll bring me back at a decent hour. My latest batch. Mm, almost there, Anthony. Maybe it needs more water? Water? You put water in pralines? Oh, no, baby. Keep trying, bro. I don't want to keep Marcel waiting. I'll see you guys at the par-tay. Goodbye. They grow up so fast, don't they, Uncle Anthony? You look... Is Anthony Brown speechless? I never thought I'd see the day. - I am not speechless. - Mm-hm. I'm just looking for some of the million words to describe how you look. Well, I'm going to need you to find your words and, uh, do it quickly because you're making me nervous. Like Christmas. Like Christmas? Please explain. You look the way Christmas makes people feel, all warm and beautiful and absolutely perfect. I'm not used to compliments like that. Get used to it. They're coming all night long. Oh, let me find out you're secretly a softie. Don't tell anybody. I do have a reputation to protect. - Oh! - Shall we? We shall. You were right. You sure know much more than me about young love. Do you think people our age could find something like that? Or do you think it's too late? Well, Loretta, you should know, it's never too late. Not for love. A dance? Of course, Marcel. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ That's out there, right? You having a good time, honey? There are so many people here. - I wish Mom could see. - I know, honey. Well, you stay here with Grandma. I have a little surprise for you. What is it? Wouldn't be surprised if I told you now, would it? - And that's my uncle Wilbur. - Uh-huh. And next to him, those are my cousins, Amani and Nick. Wow. That's a lot of people. You aren't going to run out on me again, are you? No. I'm not going anywhere. This is going to be an amazing night. Yes, it is. I can feel it. I'm glad I get to spend it with you. May I have this dance? Absolutely. You are a pretty good dancer, Mr. Brown. You should see my samba. - Oh, your samba? - My samba. I would love to see that. - You will see that. - Mm. Mom, have you seen Charlene? I'm sure she's here somewhere. Okay. I'm gonna go ask Anthony. No, no. Let them have their fun. Yeah, I guess you're right. How was that for a start? - Very good. - Yeah. You are definitely full of surprises. I'm sure she's getting dressed somewhere. I know, I just... I don't wanna miss the family photo, you know? I'll help you look for her. So do you have any weird childhood sweethearts hiding around here? Oh. I wouldn't know. - Oh? - I've only been looking at you. Mm. Perfect answer. Give me just a few minutes? Absolutely. - Don't go far. - I won't. - Hey, Jordan. - Hey. May I have this dance? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. Moving pretty good! Hi, it's Charlene. I'm not here right now. Leave me a message. Oh, this party is so much fun. Oh, my goodness, Miss Loretta, it is incredible. Your family is just so wonderful, and thank you for having me. Can I show you something? Of course. Okay. - Is that my house? - Yes, ma'am. It's a little bit of old New Orleans, with a little bit of modern, and a little bit of Anthony. And a lot of you. Look, I have something for you. What? - Come over here, baby. - Okay. Here it is, right here. Let me hold your purse. - Oh, thank you so much. - But you have to open it. Okay. Miss Loretta, it's beautiful. I make them every Christmas for everyone in the family. But I'm... I'm not, um... But I didn't... I didn't get you anything, But you did. You gave me more than I could ever imagine. My grandson always thought that working would make a life worth living. But you, my dear, you brought him back home, back to the family. He's so lucky to have family like you. And we're lucky to have you. And you know what? I've got to go find my boo thing before my cousins, they're gonna think it's open season. Please let me grab this purse. - Take your purse, bye, boo. - Bye! - Oh boy, don't hurt him. - I will. He is so happy. I see you got my grandmother's gift. You are so lucky to have such a great family. But why didn't you tell me? You didn't even warn me. I didn't have anything for her. She wanted you to have it. You know, she wants you to feel like part of the celebration, and part of the family. All right, folks. Now, we have one more song, and then it's time for the annual Brown family photo! A one, two... - Oh, Charlene. - What? Huh? - Um, I got to go. Excuse me. - Wait. Huh? Excuse me. Anthony, Anthony, hey. Uh, where's Charlene? Wait. Where's my wife? Charlene, my wife, you're supposed to picked her up. Where is she? - My wife... - Charlene. Charlene, baby. Hey, baby! Oh, oh, I missed you. Mm. I missed you more. - Oh, you look so good. - Oh, thanks. - Hi! - Oh, hi. I am so sorry. How could you forget? I reminded you over a hundred times. I took a cab. It's okay. Yep, but you told me you was gonna get her. I was up in the party all night. It's fine, Christopher. I heard you got a new girlfriend. - Did you get Jordan's gift? - It's in the car. She doesn't need a gift until Christmas. Chris, you know love gets folks distracted sometimes, you should know. Hey, I don't want you guys to think that I'm not pulling my weight around here. I just... I'm trying to be a part of more things here. Nobody thinks that you're not pulling your weight, man. Is that... Is that what this is all about? All the rebuilding the house and the store, like... No, just, the family is the most important thing to me. It's more important than anything or anyone. I just want to get it right. Family first, right? Family first. Mommy! Oh, my big girl! Look at her! - Y'all about the same size! - I know. - Hey. - Hey. You're ready to go take this photo? Anthony, this is your family. I shouldn't be in this picture. Oh, of course you should. The plan was for me to come, to stay a while, and to leave. I got this offer in Toronto... So, you're leaving? The blueprints for the redesign are complete, so, um, technically my job's done. Unless... Yeah, your job here is done. I can oversee the build myself. My family's legacy, right? Yeah. It is. - Well, uh... - Goodbye, Anthony. Anthony, you know, Christmas ain't until tomorrow, right? Someone dropped this off. It's nice. What happened, honey? I'm just ready to take another crack at these pralines. You know, just because you don't work in the shop with us doesn't mean that you're not a part of what we build. We all did this together. I know. I just... I want to get this right. You know, and I don't know what I'm missing. Don't lie to me now. You know exactly what you're missing, don't you? Pralines aren't a metaphor, Grandma. Baby, let me say something to you. Pralines are everything. You miss her, don't you? Yeah, but... And you want her back, right? You know, maybe it's better this way. Maybe I'm supposed to buckle down and get back to work and get back to my life like it was before her. Is that what you really want? Hmm. Mmm. This looks pretty good. Mm, but you're right. It's wrong, wrong, wrong. Not bad, just wrong. Ooh, and that's what happens when your recipe isn't in balance. How much sugar is in that? A lot. Pralines are all about sugar. Exactly. And your life is all about work. But it isn't satisfying, is it? It's not even fun. Grandma. You want to know what it is, Anthony? My secret ingredient? I don't know, love? No, it's salt. Salt? Sometimes you just need a little bit of the unexpected to make life sweeter, to bring everything back into balance. Now, don't you want to make life a little sweeter again? I tried, but she won't answer my calls. Well, you have to try harder. It's that simple? Most things usually are. Thanks, Grandma. You don't have to thank me. You just need to go out and find that girl. Don't worry. I think I might have an idea for that. You don't have to take a red eye. You can stay one more night. Hey, do you have any extra packing cubes that I can borrow? Oh, no. I have helped you do this too many times. Come on. We're going for a walk. I have all this packing to do still. It'll be there. Okay, fine. Where are we going? You know, Grace, we have a saying here in New Orleans. - What? - Guys are like streetcars. One is coming around the corner every few minutes. What? What is this? Grace Hill, I need you to know that you belong right here in New Orleans with me. Anthony... My grandma... she has a saying. She says, "Family is who you choose." I'm standing here and I'm choosing you. I used to... believe that I didn't want to be attached to any place. Or anyone. But your beautiful family... has shown me something different. Grace, I know that you are so good on your own. I know that you have independence and you... You don't actually need me. Could you want me? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I do. Do you think you could find room in your heart for me and this big family of mine that loves you? Well... that depends. Depends on what? Do I get to ride a streetcar, too? One second, I always wanted to do this. All aboard! This is so perfect. Welcome to the family, Grace! Okay, what do you think? I can't believe you got me a whole streetcar. Just like the story. You know, a very wise woman once told me that sometimes the old ways are the best ways. - And the most romantic. - And the most romantic. Mm-hmm. It's her! It's her! Oh, I almost forgot. It's not Christmas without presents. Is this what I think it is? Anthony, these are so good. - Yes. - You did it! I can't believe it. - Mm! - Yeah? Okay. - All right, one more thing. - You're taking them? This is for you. Merry Christmas, Anthony.
