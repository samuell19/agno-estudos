Okay, man, it's 07:00. Let's pull it together, please, ok? Got a lot to get through this morning. All right, John shut up. Wait, please. Okay, first thing, got a small change of routine. Starting today, instead of handing everybody of you guys a copy of the Hot sheet, we're going to just post one on a bulletin board. That way we won't keep Xerox in business. You understand? Okay. Try out for the police. Olympics will be on this Saturday, 10:00 A.m.. There's been a complaint to the captain that illegally parked cars on Hudson. I'm not being sighted because McCrory's office is on that street. Now, that's bullshit. The real reason is that somebody's not doing his job. And if there's not a complaint, I will personally chew out the ashes of those responsible. Okay, take special note of the summary today. Your lives may depend upon it. We'll proceed with the role in the meantime. Taylor and Lipson, 715. - Wood? - Here. Seven lincoln 27. Donnelly. That's excruciating funny.

It's right there on the license. Not in originally. We're from originally. Louisville, Kentucky. Louisville, Kentucky. I don't think I ever stopped by from Louisville, Kentucky. Well, why did you stop me? I think you're drunk. Drunk? You must be joking. 07:00 in the morning. I don't care what time it is. I believe you may be driving on the influence and I'd like to give you a sobriety test. So would you kindly step out of the car, please? What? I am not drunk. Surely you can see that. Helen, why don't you just use your imagination? Now look, I don't like doing this anymore than you do, but it's part of my job, so why don't you just get out of the car, and we'll see who is right, okay? I'm late and I hopethis won't take too much time. Step right up there, please. Okay, Helen. In this line here. I want you to walk this line heel to toe, okay? You insist? Very good. Now, the next part of the test is for you see if you can understand what I'm going to tell you, okay? Listen very carefully. When I tell you too, I want you to hold your arms out like this.
