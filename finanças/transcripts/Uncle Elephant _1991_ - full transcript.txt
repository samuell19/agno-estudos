He knew how to make somebody laugh. What he'd do is kind of flip around what was happening into something funny. Mmm, mmm! You both look so tasty, and there's so much of you. Which part should I eat first? Uh, excuse me. [ Uncle Narrating ] Said the prince. But I don't think you should eat our noses. You should save them. They're quite useful. What? See?
