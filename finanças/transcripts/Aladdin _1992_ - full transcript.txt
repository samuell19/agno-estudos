Oh, I come from a land From a faraway place Where the caravan camels roam Where it's flat and immense And the heat is intense It's barbaric, but hey, it's home When the Wind's from the east And the sun's from the west And the sand in the glass is right Come on down, stop on by Hop a carpet and fly To another Arabian night Arabian nights Like Arabian days More often than not Are hotter than hot In a lot of good ways Arabian nights 'Neath Arabian moons A fool off his guard Could fall and fall hard Out there on the dunes Ah, sa/aam and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, please, come closer. Too close. A little too close. There. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the River Jordan, on sale today. Come on down. Look at this. Yes. Will not break. Will not... It broke. Ohh! Look at this. I have never seen one of these intact before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen. Ah, still good. Wait. Don't go. I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this. Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. This is no ordinary lamp. It once changed the course of a young man's life. A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. It begins on a dark night, where a dark man waits with a dark purpose. (HORSE NICKERS) You are late. A thousand apologies, O patient one. You have it, then? I had to slit a few throats, but I got it. Ah-ah-ahhh. The treasure. OW! Trust me, my pungent friend. - You'll get what's coming to you. - What's coming to you. Awk! Quickly! Follow the trail. Faster. (HORSE NEIGHS) (WIND HOWLING) JAFAR: At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders. Awk. Cave of Wonders. By Allah. Now, remember. Bring me the lamp. The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine. (CHUCKLES) Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp. Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up? Shh. (ECHOING RUMBLE) - Who disturbs my slumber? -(THIEF GASPS) It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief. Know this. Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies far within. A diamond in the rough. What are you waiting for? Go on. (BEAST SIGHING) -(ROARING) -(SCREAMING) No! (couemwe) I can't believe it. I just don't believe it. We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp. Just forget it. Look at this. I'm so ticked off that I'm molting. Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was obviously less than worthy. Oh, there's a big surprise. I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise. What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big... Yes. Only one may enter. I must find this one, this... Diamond in the rough. MAN: Stop! Thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat. All this for a loaf of bread? Whoa! (SCREAMING) - GUARD: There he is! - You won't get away so easy! You think that was easy? (GIGGLING) You two, over that way, and you, follow me. - We'll find him. - Morning, ladies. Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin? - Gotcha. - I'm in trouble. And this time... (MONKEY SQUENQNG Perfect timing, Abu, as usual. - Abu. - Come on. Let's get outta here. (SINGING) Gotta keep one jump Ahead of the bread line One swing ahead of the sword I steal only what I can't afford That's everything One jump ahead of the lawmen That's all, and that's no joke - Riffraff - BOTH: Street rat GUARD: Scoundrel MAN". Take that Just a little snack, guys Rip him open Take it back, guys I can take a hint Gotta face the facts - You're my only friend, Abu - WOMEN: Who? Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom He's become a one-man rise in crime I'd blame parents Except he hasn't got 'em Gotta eat to live Gotta steal to eat Tell you all about it When I got the time One jump ahead of the slowpokes One skip ahead of my doom Next time gonna use a nom de plume There he is One jump ahead of the hit men One hit ahead of the flock I think I'll take a stroll Around the block - MAN: Stop, thief - Vanda/ - Abu Scandal Let's not be too hasty Still I think he's rather tasty Gotta eat to live Gotta steal to eat Otherwise we'd get along GUARDS: Wrong MAIN GUARD: Get him! He's got a sword! You idiots. We've all got swords. (GROANING) - One jump ahead of the hoof beats - Vandal! - One hop ahead of the hump - Street rat! - One trick ahead of disaster Scoundrel! They're quick, but I'm much faster Here goes, better throw my hand in Wish me happy landin' AH I gotta do is jump (SCREAMING) GUARDS: Yuck! Oy! ABU: Yum, yum! Uh-oh. (SIGHS) Here. Go on. Take it. (GIGGLING) (GROANS) Ah, don't. Huh? On his way to the palace, I suppose. Another suitor for the princess. -(GIGGLING) -(WOMAN SCREAMS) -(WHINNYING) - Out of my way, you filthy brats. Hey! If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners. Oh. I'll teach you some manners. (MEN LAUGH) (GRIMACING) Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends. CROWD: Ooh! You are a worthless street rat. You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you. I'm not worthless. And I don't have fleas. (SINGING) Riffraff, street rat I don't buy that If only they'd look closer Would they see a poor boy? No, siree They'd find out There's so much more To me (SIGHS) Someday, Abu, things are gonna change. We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all. (ROOSTERS GROWING) I've never been so insulted. Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you? Good luck marrying her off. Oh! Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! - Jasmine! -(SNARLING) Confound it, Rajah. So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out. Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah? You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed, weren't you? (BOTH LAUGHING) (CLEARS THROAT) Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor who comes to call. The law says you must be married to a prince by your next birthday. The law is wrong. You've only got three more days. Father, I hate being forced into this. If I do marry, I want it to be for love. Jasmine, it's not only this law. I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I... I just want to make sure you're taken care of. Provided for. Please try to understand. I've never done a thing on my own. I've never had any real friends. (GRUMBLES) Except you, Rajah. I've never even been outside the palace walls. But, Jasmine, you're a princess. Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore. Oooh! l... l... Allah forbid you should have any daughters. Hmm? I don't know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn't nearly so picky. Oh! Ah, Jafar. My most trusted advisor. My life is but to serve you, my lord. - I'm at my wit's end. - Awk! Wit's end! (LAUGHING) on! - Have a cracker, pretty Polly. -(JAFAR LAUGHS) Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. (GRUMBLES) Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem. If anyone can help, it's you. But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond. Oh- Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years. It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. The diamond. Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine. You are most gracious, my liege. Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm? Yes. That will be pretty good. (SPITS, COUGHS) I can't take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers... Barn! Whack! Calm yourself, Iago. Then I'd grab him around the head. VVhack! Soon I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit. And then I stuff the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha! (WHINING) Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me. I'll miss you. (WHIMPERS) Good bye. (VENDORS CALLING OUT) Okay, Abu. Go. Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing. (SQUEAKING) - Get your paws off that. -(TAUNTING) Why, you... Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape! Good bye. - Nice going, Abu. -(COOING) Breakfast is served. Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass or silver. Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs. Sugar dates and pistachios. Would the lady like a necklace? A pretty necklace for a pretty lady. Fresh fish! We catch 'em, you buy 'em! Oh, no. I don't think so. - Om -(GULPING) - Excuse me. -(GULPS) (BELCHES) I'm really very sorry. Wow. Uh-oh. Hello? Hello? Oh, you must be hungry. Here you go. You'd better be able to pay for that. - Pay? - No one steals from my cart. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money. - Thief! - Please... If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the sultan. Do you know what the penalty is for stealing? No! No, please! Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her. I've been looking all over for you. - What are you doing? - Just play along. You, uh, know this girl? Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She's a little crazy. She said she knew the sultan. She thinks the monkey is the sultan. O wise Sultan, how may I serve you? (GIBBERISH) Tragic, isn't it? But no harm done. Now, come along, sis. Time to go see the doctor. Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you? No, no, no. Not that one. Come on, Sultan. (GIBBERING) (GASPING) Huh? What? Come back here, you little thieves! (EXPLOSION) couldn't we just wait for a real storm? Save your breath, Iago. Faster. Yes, O mighty evil one. (PANTING) Part, sands of time. Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave. Yes! Yes! There he is. My diamond in the rough. That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for? Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to the palace, shall we? Swell. (COUGHS) (SINISTER LAUGHTER) Almost there. I want to thank you for stopping that man. Uh, forget it. So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh? Is it that obvious? Well, you do kind of stand out. I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be. Hmm. I'm a fast learner. Wow. (CHUCKLING) Hey. Come on. This way. Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful. Is this where you live? Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please. That sounds fabulous. Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view. Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh? Oh, it's wonderful. I wonder what it would be like to live there, and have servants and valets. Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress. It's better than here. You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards. You're not free to make your own choices. - Sometimes you feel so... - You're just... - Trapped. - Trapped. (CLEARS THROAT) So, where are you from? What does it matter? I ran away and I am not going back. - Really? How come? - Why, you... My father's forcing me to get married. That's... That's awful. - ALADDINI Abu! -(ANGRY SQUEAKING) What? Abu says, uh, that's not fair. What? - Oh, did he? - Yeah, of course. And does Abu have anything else to say? Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help. Oh, boy. Hmm. Tell him that's very sweet. Here you are. - They're after me! - They're after you? My father must have sent them... - Do you trust me? - What? - Do you trust me? - Yes... Then jump! We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat? Run! Go! Get out of here! Get this thing off of me! - It's the dungeon for you, boy. - Get off of me. Let him go. - Looky here, men. A street mouse. -(GUARDS LAUGH) Unhand him, by order of the princess. Princess Jasmine. - The princess? - ABU: Princess? That's not your concern. Do as I command. Release him. I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar. - You'll have to take it up with him. - Believe me, I will. J afar? Oh, Princess. Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck. How may I be of service to you? The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders. Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. - The boy was a criminal. - What was his crime? I can't breathe, Jafar. Why, kidnapping the princess, of course. If you could just... Aah! That hurt! He didn't kidnap me. I ran away. Oh, dear. Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known... What do you mean? Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out. What sentence? - Death. -(GASPING) - By beheading. - No. I am exceedingly sorry, Princess. How could you? (WEEPING) (couemwe) (GASPING) So, how did it go? I think she took it rather well. (JASMINE CRYING) It's all my fault, Rajah. - I didn't even know his name. -(RAJAH MURMURING) I must have sounded so stupid to her. ABUI Y00-h00! Aladdin! Hello! Abu. Down here. (SQUEAKING) Come on, help me out of these. (SCOLDING) Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't worry, Abu. I'll never see her again. I'm a street rat, remember? And there's a law. She's gotta marry a prince. - She deserves a prince. - Ta-da! I'm a fool. MAN: You're only a fool if you give up, boy. Who are you? A lowly prisoner, like yourself. I'm listening. There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Ooh! Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager. Jaiar, can you hurry up'? I'm Gym' 'm here. -(SQUAWKING) - But the law says only a prince can... You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you? (WHEEZING LAUGH) Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me? I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it. Uh, one problem. It's out there. We're in here. Uh-uh. Things aren't always what they seem. So, do we have a deal? Oh, I don't know. (THUNDER CRASHING) Who disturbs my slumber? Uh, it is I, Aladdin. Proceed. Touch nothing but the lamp. And then you shall have your reward. Come on, Abu. (SQUEAKING) - Would you look at that! -(WHIMPERING) Abu! (WHINES) Don't touch anything. We gotta find that lamp. (GRUMBLES) Huh? - Aladdin! - Abu, will you knock it off? (SCREECHES) Abu, what are you, crazy? A magic carpet. Come on. Come on out. We're not gonna hurt you. (SCREECHES) Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not gonna bite. Thanks. (SQUEAKING) Wait a minute. Don't go. Maybe you can help us. Hey! Whoa! - I think he knows where it is. -(SQUEAKS EXCITEDLY) (ECHOE5) (WHISPERS) Wait here. (MOANING) Oh! This is it? This is what we came all the way down here to... Abu! No! - CAVE: lnfidels! - Uh-oh. CAVE: You have touched the forbidden treasure! Now you will never again see the light of day! Whoa! Help! Help! Help! Gotcha! Carpet, let's move. Abu! Abu, this is no time to panic. Start panicking. BOTH: Whoa! (ABU PANTING) (THUNDER CRACKS) (ROARING) - Help me out. - Throw me the lamp. I can't hold on. Give me your hand. First give me the lamp. (MANIACAL LAUGHTER) Yes! At last! -(WICKED LAUGHTER) -(ALADDIN STRUGGLES) What are you doing? Giving you your reward. Your eternal reward. (SCREAMING) (YELLING) (ROARING) (CHUCKUNG) It's mine. It's all mine. I... Where is it? No. No! Jasmine? SULTAN: Oh, dearest. What's wrong? (SNIFFLING) Jafar has done something terrible. There, there, my dear. We'll set it right. Now, tell me everything. Oh. Aladdin. Wake up. Aladdin. On! My head. We're trapped. That two-faced son of a jackal! (SNARLING) Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp. Aha! (CHUCKLING) Why, you hairy little thief. Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece ofjunk. Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out. Aaaaahhhhh! C)y! 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck. Hang on a second. V\/hoa! Whoa! Does it feel good to be outta there. Hi. Where you from? What's your name? Uh... Uh, Aladdin. Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din? How about Laddie? Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, laddie." I must have hit my head harder than I thought. Do you smoke? Mind if I do? (GIGGLING) Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope I didn't singe the fur. Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia. Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo. Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master. Either that or I'm gettin' bigger. Look at me from the side. Do I look different to you? Wait a minute. I'm your master? That's right. He can be taught. What would you wish of me? The ever impressive, the long contained, the often imitated, but never duplicated... (ECHOING) Duplicated, duplicated... Genie of the Lamp! Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfilment. Thank you. - Whoa. Wish fulfilment? - Three wishes, to be exact. And ixnay on the wishing for more wishes. That's it. Three. Lino, dos, tres. Now I know I'm dreaming. Master, I don't think you quite realize what you've got here. So why don't you just ruminate whilst I illuminate the possibilities. (SINGING) Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves Scheherazade had a thousand tales But, master, you're in luck 'Cause up your sleeves You got a brand of magic never fails You got some power In your corner now You got some punch, pizzazz Yahoo and how See, all you gotta do ls rub that lamp and I'll say "Mr. Aladdin, sir What will your pleasure be?" Let me take your order Jot it down You ain't never had a friend like me Life is your restaurant And I'm your maitre d' Come on, whisper what it is you want You ain't never had a friend like me Yes, sir We pride ourselves on service You're the boss, the king, the shah Say what you wish It's yours, true dish How 'bout a little more baklava?

Can your friends pull this Out their little hat? Can your friends go poof Hey, looky here Ha-ha! Can your friends go "Abracadabra, let her rip" So don't you sit there Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed I'm hereto answer AH your midnight prayers You got me bona fide certified You got a genie For your charge daffaires I got a powerful urge to help you out So what's your wish? I really wanna know You got a list That's three miles long, no doubt AH you gotta do is rub like so Mr. Aladdin, sir Have a wish or two or three I'm on the job, you big nabob You ain't never had a friend Never had a friend You ain't never had a friend Never had a friend You ain't never had a friend Like me Ah-ha-ha! - Wah-ha-ha! -(GREEDY LAUGH) You ain't never had a friend like me -(BUZZING) -(WEAK APPLAUSE) (CHATTERING) Huh? -(GROANS) - So, what'll it be, master? You're gonna grant rne any three wishes I want, right? Ah, almost. There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos. Like? So don't ask. Rule number two. I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else. You little ponem there. Rule number three. I can't bring people back from the dead. It's not a pretty picture. I don't like doing it. Other than that, you got it. - Hmm. - Oh! Provisos? You mean limitations? On wishes? Some all-powerful genie. Can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave. Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out of here. Excuse me? Are you lookin' at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here? And all of sudden you're walking out on me? I don't think so, not right now. -(ABU SCREECHES) - In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere. Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet. We're... Outta here! SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage. If it weren't for all your years of loyal service... From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with rne, before they are beheaded. I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again. Jasmine... Jafar. Let's put this whole messy business behind us. Please. At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. When I am queen, I will have the power to get rid of you. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) There, now. That's nice. All settled, then. Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine? Jasmine! (GROWLS) if only I had gotten that lamp. (GROWLING) To think we gotta keep kissing up -for the rest of our lives... - No, Iago. Then she'll have us banished. Or beheaded. BOTH: Eww! Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar. What? And, uh, then you become the sultan. Oh. Marry the shrew. I become the sultan. - The idea has merit. - Yes, merit. Yes. And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff. Yaaah! Kersplat! (WICKED LAUGHTER) I love the way your foul little mind works. (BOTH LAUGH SINISTERLY) Don't stand until the rug has come to a complete stop. Thank you. Goodbye now. Good-bye. Thank you. Well, how about that, Mr. Doubting Mustafa? Oh, you sure showed me. Now, about my three wishes. Dost mine ears deceive me? Three? You are down by one, boy. Ah, no. I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own. Well, I feel sheepish. All right, you bad boy, but no more freebies. Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be good. What would you wish for? Me? No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case... Ah, forget it. - What? - No, I can't. I... Come on. Tell me. Freedom. You're a prisoner? It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic powers... ltty bitty living space. Genie, that's terrible. But, oh, to be free... Not have to go, "Poof. What do you need? "Poof. What do you need? Poof. What do you need?" To be my own master. Such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world. But what am I talking about? Let's get real here. It's not gonna happen. Why not? The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out. So you can guess how often that's happened. I'll do it. I'll set you free. - Uh-huh, yeah, right. - No, really, I promise. After I make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free. Well, here's hopin'. All right. Let's make some magic. So how 'bout it? What is it you want most? Well, there's this girl. Wrong. I can't make anybody fall in love, remember? Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and... - Pretty? - Beautiful. She's got these eyes that just... And this hair. Wow. And her smile... (SIGHS) Ami. C'est I'amour. But she's the princess. Hey, can you make me a prince? Let's see here. Chicken é la king? Nope. Alaskan king crab. Ow. I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No. Aha. "To make a prince." Is that an official wish? Say the magic words. Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince. All right! Yo, yo! Woof! Woof! First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century. These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar? No. Let's work with me here. Ooh. I like it. Muy macho. Now, it still needs something. What does it say to me? It says mode of transportation. Excuse me, monkey boy. Aqul'. Over here. - Uh-oh. - GENIE: Here he comes. What better way to make your entrance on the streets of Agrabah than riding your very own, brand-new camel? Watch out. They spit. Mmm. Not enough. Still not enough. Let's see. What do you need? Yes! Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo. - Whoa! -(TRUMPETS) Talk about your trunk space. Check this action out. (TRUMPETS) (FRIGHTENED MONKEY NOISES) Abu, you look good. GENIE: He's got the outfit. He's got the elephant. But we're not through yet. Hang on to your turban, kid. We're gonna make you a star. (DOOR OPENS) Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter. Oh, really? Right here. "If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, "then the sultan shall choose for her." But Jasmine hated all those suitors. How could I choose someone she hates? Not to worry, my liege. There is more. "If in the event a suitable prince cannot be found..." Jerk. "A princess must then be wed to..." Hmm. Interesting. What? Who? The royal vizier. Why, that would be me. I'm quite sure that... Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord. Yes. Desperate measures. I will order the princess to... But you're so old. The princess will marry me. The princess will marry... -(TRUMPET FANFARE) - What? What is that? That music. (CHUCKUNG) Jafar, you must come and see this. (SINGING) Make way for Prince Ali Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali" Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar Hey you, let us through It's a bright new star Oh come, be the first on your block To meet his eye Make way, here he comes Ring bells, bang the drums You're gonna love this guy Prince Ali, fabulous he Ali Ababwa Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee Now, try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday salaam Then come and meet His spectacular coterie Prince Ali, mighty is he Ali Ababwa Strong as 10 regular men definitely He faced the galloping hordes A hundred bad guys with swords Who sent those goons to their lords? Why, Prince Ali He's got 75 golden camels Don't they look lovely, June? Purple peacocks, he's got 53 Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers. Has he got a zoo I'm telling you It's a world-class menagerie Prince Ali, handsome is he Ali Ababwa That physique, how can I speak Weak at the knee Well, get on out in that square Adjust your veil and prepare To gawk and grove! and stare At Prince Ali - He's got 95 white Persian monkeys - He's got the monkeys - Let's see the monkeys - And to view them he charges no fee He's generous So generous He's got slaves He's got servants and flunkies They're just lousy with loyalty to All Prince Ali Prince Ali, Amorous he Ali Ababwa Heard your princess Was a sight lovely to see And that, good people, is why He got dolled up and dropped by With 60 elephants, llamas galore With bears and lions A brass band and more With his 40 fakirs His cooks, his bakers His birds that warble on key Make way For Prince Ali Splendid. Absolutely marvelous. (CLEARS THROAT) Your Majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand. Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course. I'm delighted to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He's delighted, too. Ecstatic. - I'm afraid, Prince Abubu... - Ababwa. Whatever. You cannotjust parade in here uninvited and expect to... By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. Ooh. I don't suppose I might... Why, certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me. Sire, I must advise against this. Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun. Ow, ow, ow. Ahh! Whoa! Look out, here I come. Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure. - Try me. - SULTAN: Look out, Polly. Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug. Aah! WheW! Out of the way. I'm coming in to land. Jafar, watch this. - Spectacular, Your Highness. - That was lovely. Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it. This is a very impressive youth. And a prince besides. - I don't trust him, Sire. - Nonsense. One thing I pride myself on, Jafar, I'm an excellentjudge of character. Oh, excellentjudge. Yeah, sure. Not! SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one. And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine. Your Highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf. What makes him think he is worthy of the princess? Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter. How dare you. All of you. Standing around deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won. Oh, dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down. I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abubu. ALADDIN: (SIGHS) What am I gonna do? I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish. (GROWLING) So move. Hey- That's a good move. I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug. Genie, I need help. All right, Sparky, here's the deal. If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter. - Do you got it? - What? (READING) No way. If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh. Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself. Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be. Okay, I'm gonna go see her. I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident. How do I look? Like a prince. (SIGHS) - ALADDIN: Princess Jasmine? -(GROWLING) - Who's there? - It's me, Prince Ali. Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa. I do not want to see you. No, no, please, Princess. Give me a chance. - JASMINE: Just leave me alone. - Down, kitty. So, how's our little beau doing? - Good kitty, take off. -(RAJAH GROWLING) Down, kitty. Wait. Wait. Do I know you? Uh, no. No. You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace. The marketplace? I have servants who go to the marketplace for me. Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met. No. I guess not. She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything. Pick a feature. Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine? You're very... Wonderful, magnificent, glorious, -punctual. - Punctual. - Punctual? - Sorry. - Uh, beautiful. - Nice recovery. Hmm. I'm rich, too, you know. - Yeah. - The daughter of a sultan. I know. A fine prize for any prince to marry. Uh, right. Right. A prince like me. Warning! Warning! Right. A prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering peacock I've met. Mayday! Mayday! - What? - Stop her. Stop her! - Want me to sting her? - Buzz off. Okay, fine. But remember, "bee" yourself. - Yeah, right. - What? Uh... Uh, you're right. (SIGHS) You aren'tjust some prize to be won. You should be free to make your own choice. I'll go now. - No! - What? What? How... How are you doing that? - It's a magic carpet. - It's lovely. -(KISSES) - You, uh... We could get out of the palace, see the world. - Is it safe? - Sure. Do you trust me? - What? - Do you trust me?

It's a shame Abu had to miss this. Nah. He hates fireworks. He doesn't like flying, either. Uh, that is, um... Oh, no. You are the boy from the market. I knew it. - Why did you lie to me? - Jasmine, I'm sorry. - Did you think I was stupid? - No. - That I wouldn't figure it out? - No. I mean, I hoped you wouldn't. No, that's not what I meant. Who are you? Tell me the truth. The truth? The truth. Um... The truth is... But I really am a prince. Why didn't you just tell me? Well, you know, royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think? Hmm. Not that strange. Good night, my handsome prince. Sleep well, Princess. (SIGHS) Yes! (SIGHS) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right. -(YELLING) -(STRUGGLING) (MUFFLED) Abu. Abu. Hold him. I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abubu. (MUFFLED) Why, you... Make sure he's never found. (LAUGHING) Never fails. You get in the bath and there's a rub at the lamp. Hello? AI? (GASPING) AI! Kid, snap out Of it. You can't cheat on this one. I can't help unless you make a wish. You have to say, "Genie, I want you to save my life." Got it? Come on, Aladdin! I'll take that as a yes. (IMITATING ALARM) Up scope. (BABBLING IN GERMAN) (couemwe) Don't you scare me like that. Genie, I, uh... L.- - Thanks, Genie. - Oh, Al. I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid. Not that I wanna pick out curtains or anything. (HUMMING) SULTAN: Jasmine. Oh, Father, I just had the most wonderful time. - I'm so happy. - You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you. - What? - You will wed Jafar. (GASPING) You're speechless, I see. A fine quality in a wife. I will never marry you. - Father, I choose Prince Ali. - Prince Ali left. Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar. - Prince Ali! -(GASPING) HOW in the... Uh. AWk! Tell them the truth, Jafar. You tried to have me killed. What? Ridiculous nonsense, Your Highness. He is obviously lying. Obviously lying. Father, what's wrong with you? I know what's wrong. Oh, my! Your Highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this. (STAMMERING) What? Jafar? You, you traitor! Guards! Guards! Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it. Just dig a grave for both of us. We're dead. - SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once. -(STRUGGLING) This is not done yet, boy. -(LAUGHING) -(COUGHING) - Jasmine, are you all right? - Yes. Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time. This is horrible, just horrible. How will I ever... Huh? Can this be true? My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? Ha, ha! Praise Allah! You brilliant boy, I could kiss you. I won't. I'll leave that to my... But you two will be wed at once. Yes, yes. And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then you, my boy, will become sultan. - Sultan? - SULTAN: Yes. A fine upstanding youth such as yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs. IAGO: We gotta get outta here. I gotta start packing. Only essentials. We gotta travel light. I think I'm making a weird face in it. (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip! Good grip- Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin. - He has the lamp, Iago. - Why, that miserable... But you are going to relieve him of it. Me? Sultan? They want me to be Sultan? Huzzah! (SINGING) Hail the conquering hero (PATRIOTIC TUNE PLAYS) Aladdin, you've just won the heart of the princess. What are you gonna do next? (SIGHS DEEPLY) (WHISPERING) Psst. Your line is, "I'm going to free the genie." Any time. - Genie. I can't. - Sure you can. You just go, "Genie, I wish you free." I'm serious. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. But they wanna make me sultan. Without you, I'm just Aladdin. - Al, you won. - Because of you. The only reason anyone thinks I'm worth anything is because of you. What if they find out I'm not really a prince? I can't wish you free. Fine. I understand. After all, you've lied to everyone else. Hey, I was beginning to feel left out. Now, if you'll excuse me, master. (smaruwe) Genie, I'm really sorry. (RASPBERRY) Well, fine. Then just stay in there. What are you guys looking at? -(WHIMPERING) -(SNIFFLING) ALADDIN: Look, I...

(GLEEFUL CACKLING) (IMITATES JAFAR) "Excellent work, Iago." Ah, go on. "No, really. On a scale of one to 10, you are an 11." Oh, Jafar, you're too kind. I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing. People of Agrabah, my daughter has finally chosen a suitor. -(CROWD CHEERING) - ALADDIN: Jasmine. Ali, where have you been? Jasmine, there's something I got to tell you. The whole kingdom's turned out for Father's announcement. - You don't understand... - Good luck. - SULTAN: Ali Ababwa! -(CHEERING) Oh, boy. (CHEERING) Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak. Let them cheer. You know, Al, I'm getting really... I don't think you're him. Tonight, the part of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man. - I am your master now. - I was afraid of that. Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to rule on high as sultan. - Whoa! - Bless my soul. What is this? What's going on? Oh, my goodness, what's happening? Father. (CACKLING) Jafar, you vile betrayer. That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you. Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that. -(GASPS) The lamp. -(JAFAR LAUGHS) Finders keepers, Abubu. (WHISTLES) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Genie, no! Sorry, kid. I got a new master now. Jafar, I order you to stop. Ah, but there's a new order now. My order. Finally, you will bow to me. We will never bow to you. Why am I not surprised? If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer! Genie, my second wish... -(JAFAR LAUGHS MANIACALLY) - Genie, stop! Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for Sorcerer Jafar! Now, where were we? Ah, yes. Abject humiliation. - Down, boy. -(MEOWS) Oh, Princess. There's someone I'm dying to introduce you to. Jafar. Get your hands off her. (SINGING) Prince Ali Yes, it is he But not as you know him Read my lips And come to grips with reality Yes, meet a blast from your past Whose lies were too good to last Say hello To your precious Prince Ali Or should we say Aladdin? Ali? Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just...

So his prospects Take a terminal dip His assets frozen, the venue chosen ls the ends of the Earth, whoopee! - So long! - Good-bye, see ya. Ex-Prince Ali (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) (WIND HOWLING) (SHIVERING) Abu. Abu! (ABU WHIMPERING) Oh, this is all my fault. I should have freed the genie when I had the chance. I'm sorry, Abu.

Jafar, leave him alone. (GROWLING) It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen... - Never. -(ENRAGED GROWL) I'll teach you some respect. (GASPING) No. Genie. I have decided to make my final wish. I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me. JASMINE: Jafar. I never realized how incredibly handsome you are. Mmm. That's better. Now, pussycat, tell me more about myself. You're tall, dark, well dressed... AI. AI, little buddy. Shh. Al, I can't help you. I work for Sefior Psychopath now. What are you gonna do? Hey, I'm a street rat, remember? I'll improvise. JASMINE: Cute little gaps between your teeth. Go on. And your beard is so twisted. - You've stolen my heart. -(GASPING) Jafar... -(IAGO MUMBLING) - And the street rat? What street rat? -(CLATTERING) -(GASPING) (GASPING) BOTH: Yech! That was... You! How many times do I have to kill you, boy? Get the lamp. No! Ah, ah, ah, Princess. Your time is up. (GROWLING) Jasmine. Oh, nice shot, Jaf... Don't toy with me. Abu! JAFAR: Things are unravelling fast now, boy. (JAFAR LAUGHING) Get the point? (LAUGHING) (STRAINING) I'm just getting warmed up. Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake? A snake, am I? Perhaps you'd like to see how snakelike I can be. (SCREAMING) (SINGING) Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake Stick that sword into that snake You stay out of this. Jafar, Jafar, he's our man. If he can't do it... Great! JASMINE: Aladdin. (SCREAMS) Jasmine, hang on. (LAUGHING) You little fool. You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth. Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a... Awk! The genie. The genie. The genie has more power than you'll ever have. What? He gave you your power. He can take it away. Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing rne into this? Face it, Jafar. You're still just second best. You're right. His power does exceed my own. But not for long. The boy is crazy. He's a little punch-drunk. One too many hits with the snake. Slave, I make my third wish. I wish to be an all-powerful genie! All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al. Yes. Yes! The power. -(JAFAR LAUGHS) -(JASMINE COUGHS) The absolute power! - What have you done? - Trust me. The universe is mine to command, to control! Not so fast, Jafar. Aren't you forgetting something? - Huh? - You wanted to be a genie, you got it. What? And everything that goes with it. - No!No! - I'm gettin' out of here. ALADDIN: Phenomenal cosmic powers... You're the genie. I don't want... ltty bitty living space. Al, you little genius, you. - Ahh! '(MEOWS) JAFAR: Get your blasted beak out of my face. - IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron. - Don't tell me to shut up. Allow me. (IAGO YELLING INDISTINCTLY) JAFARI Shut up! Jasmine... I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince. I know why you did. Well, I guess this is good-bye? Oh, that stupid law. This isn't fair. I love you. (SNIFFLES) Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left. Just say the word and you're a prince again. Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude. This is love. Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I know. I've looked. Jasmine, I do love you, but I got to stop pretending to be something I'm not. I understand. Genie, I wish for your freedom. One bona fide prince pedigree coming up. - What? - Genie, you're free. I'm free. I'm free. Quick. Quick. Wish for something outrageous. Say, "I want the Nile." Wish for the Nile. Try that. - Uh, I wish for the Nile. - No way! (LAUGHING GLEEFULLY) Oh, does that feel good! Oh! I'm free! I'm free at last! I'm hittin' the road. I'm off to see the world. I'm... Genie, I'm... I'm gonna miss you. Me, too, Al. (SNIFFLES) No matter what anybody says, you'll always be a prince to me. That's right. You've certainly proven your worth as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the problem. - Father? - Well, am I sultan or am I sultan? From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy. Him. I choose... I choose you, Aladdin. Call me Al. Oh, all of you, come over here. Big group hug. Group hug. Mind if I kiss the monkey? Ooh, hairball. Well, I can't do any more damage around this Popsicle stand. I'm outta here! Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds! Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history. No, I'm mythology. I don't care what I am. I'm free!
