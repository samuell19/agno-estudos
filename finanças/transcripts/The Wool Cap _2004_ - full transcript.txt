Listen, we're from the Child Welfare Department, and we were wondering if we could talk to you. Sure. ( phone ringing, loud rock music blaring ) MAN ( over machine ): Gigot, it's ten minutes to 9. What in the name of God is going on? Those idiots next door are already at it. We had an agreement. ( snoring ) Now, you do something, damn it. ( hangs phone up ) ( birds singing, dog barking ) ( doorbell buzzes ) Listen, they're gonna move Louella to a different home. It ain't us. We love her. They're saying we got too many, but that's a bunch of BS. I think it's her school. She's having a lot of trouble keeping up. They think a different environment, I guess. She also got caught stealing lattes at Starbucks. Lou. Lou! LOU: I thought you were a bad teacher. Jeez. And she sweats. It's these giant brown stains under her armpits. It's disgusting. And her breath... She must eat... Garlic and cockroaches for breakfast. So they're moving me again? That is fine by me. You don't get to tell me what to do anymore. ( sighs ) Yeah, yeah, yeah. You've shown me that. I took something of yours. I took it by accident out of that box. That girl with your hat. She your sister? She died, right? That hat didn't look so good on her either. ( gate swinging shut ) ( slow, reflective theme plays ) ( car horn beeps ) Now, get out of here. Hey. What's going on here? He brought his own bottle. He does it all the time. COP: Don't be throwing people around like that. He's your problem now. You all right? Got any ID, pal? Where do you live? Whoa. Whoa. What's your name? JAMAL: He doesn't speak. He can't talk. He's the super of our building. I'll get him home. You know this kid? I'll walk him. All right. I want you staying out of that bar, you hear me? ( police radio squawking ) JAMAL: Come on. ( loud rap music from bar ) Whoa. Chill, man. Chill. I didn't have nothing to do with it. I swear to God I'm being straight with you, man. What they did, that was wrong. I told them that. I told 'em. Whoa. Hey. Easy, big guy. Easy, man. Come on. Hang on to me. Be cool. Chill, man. Be cool, man. ( laughs ): Charles? Your name is Charles? Well, uh, Mr. Charles of the "garden apartment," it appears this letter was mistakenly put in my box. ( loud rock music playing in the distance ) ( music stops ) MAN 1: Stop. You're crazy. MAN 2: Hey, I told you. I warned you. Bastards! I couldn't take much more of this. You're gonna pay for that, man! Oy gevalt. My kingdom for a horse. MAN 2: I'm putting an end to this! Oh, what the...? MAN 2: This has got to stop. I work nights. It's the pounding. That pounding and pounding. That's not music. It's not music. Man, he right. Y'all guys stink. Y'all sound like six cats in a high-speed blender. MAN 1: You're insane, man. I'm calling the police. MAN 2: Arggh! MAN 1: Oh! Oh! The last good song was "Fascinating Rhythm." Ira Gershwin, 1924. MAN 2: One more thing for you, pal. Do you think I was kidding you? MAN 1: That's just great. MAN 2: If I have to come back in here one more time... One more time... You are going off the balcony... and your friends are going off the balcony too! ( plays bass ) Don't worry about it. You might be coming down with something. Everybody I know has a cold. You look tired. You want something to drink? Marry you? ( laughs ) Oh. Um... You know, honey, I... I couldn't adopt that girl either. I spent more time in jail than you. You haven't got anybody that could help? No family? ( sighs ) ( laughs ) Oh, I'd love to have seen your face if I'd said yes. ( plaintive trumpet theme playing ) Why don't you go? Don't worry, I'll see you next Wednesday. Just go. ( dance music playing inside shop ) Something to drink? Ice? Five dollars. Is there something wrong? Can I get you something else? ( closes cab door ) Yes? Do the Gigots live here? I'm Mrs. Gigot. ( exhales ) Are you Charles? She was diagnosed in June. By November, we couldn't keep her here anymore. So we put her in the hospital. She never came out. She died December 3rd, 1983. I tried to get in touch with you. I sent a letter to the address I had for you. It came back "addressee unknown." I called the VA. I even called your friend in Chicago, your Vietnam buddy. No one knew where you were. MRS. GIGOT: I met your dad in 1985. On a vacation in Mexico. Well, it was on a cruise ship. I was sick the whole time. What do you want, Charlie? You in trouble? You were just in the neighborhood and you thought you'd stop by? After 28 years? "I'm sorry about Mom ." Why don't I... No. No. I want you to stay. "I have a small wiper." Windshield wiper... Prob... Trouble. "I have a problem." "I do need your help. "But first... "I have to tell you something. "The accident "was my fault. "It was all my fault. "I was falling. "Tripping. I had been smoking marijuana, doing drugs, drinking..." You think I am an idiot? You think we didn't know that? My God, Charlie. You didn't breathe a sober breath the two months that you were home. Why do you think we were fighting all the time? Why do you think I wouldn't let you use the car? "Why didn't they arrest me? You were hanging on by a thread. Everybody thought you were gonna die too, for God's sakes. Should we have pressed charges against you? "I was wasted." I know that. Gene... We didn't know how to help you. I tried to get you back to work. That's why I was pressing to get you to come into the company. What do you need from us, Charlie? "I need... I need you to forgive me." GENE: Forgive you? Get in line, right behind me. Because every day I ask myself... why I didn't get you help. Why I didn't find the strength to put you in a hospital. Want forgiveness? Take it up with God. ( scoffs ) Hope you have better luck than me. "I got arrested "some time ago. "Felony. I was in prison. "So I can't... "foster... "I can't foster her myself. "I would do all the work. "I'd move here. "She would live with me. "But legally... How dare you? Eugene. After all you put us through. You put your mother through! She died without... All she kept asking, all she wanted... was you. You lost your sister. I lost both my children. And now you have the nerve to come here and ask this crazy thing. Excuse me. ( woman sniffs tearfully ) ( blows nose ) You said you just needed some papers signed. ( door opens, closes ) ( car horns honking ) TERRY: She says she was just holding them while she was shopping. Of course, she didn't have any money, so that didn't really fly. Did she have a problem with shoplifting when she was with you? Mmm. She also seems to like Starbucks. I was hoping that when I moved her, that this new family would make her feel... I don't know. Well, the teacher's report... "Severe learning disability, probable attention deficit disorder." I know. We had her at a residential facility, but she seems to have been AWOL most of the time. So now she's at the Wright Juvenile Detention Center. I don't know what to do. You? What, you wanna see her? Yeah. I have to get you a visitor's authorization. ( door buzzes ) I'm sorry. She doesn't wanna see you. That's what she said. Can I help you? WOMAN: Hi. Excuse me, I was just wondering... I wanna talk to you... GIRL: Yes, you were. ( girls chattering ) ( pounding on door ) IRA: I hate this holiday. It's pagan, you know that? Did I tell you the bit about the Christmas tree? ( groaning ) Oh, my God. What the hell are you trying to do, kill me? I love Mexico, but what kind of culture is it when they put a worm in the booze, on purpose? ( chuckles ) Have a drink with me. ( whistles ) Completely? Oh, Gigot, you tried everything you could. You tried your best, but... Here, Gigot, here. Open this. I'm not in the habit of buying clothes for people. But I can't stand to look at you in that schmatte anymore. No offense, you look like a condom: a walking condom. Try it on. Ah, my father always said, "You can always judge a man by the hat he wears." ( slow, plaintive theme playing ) Now you're styling, my friend.
