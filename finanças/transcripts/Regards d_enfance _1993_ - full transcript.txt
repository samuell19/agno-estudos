THE GOOD CHILD Look. The ocean is beautiful. You're leaving tomorrow. A month is too short. Remember what I told you, especially about the midday sun. Be careful! Never go in without getting your neck wet first. Beware of currents. Even the Mediterranean can be dangerous. Julien! Are you listening to me? - Yes Dad. - Don't slow down the walk otherwise there's no benefit. Get plenty sleep. And read 50 pages every day, At least. Holidays aren't just for daydreaming. July with my father. August with my mother. What are you going to do, Dad? While I'm with her at the house down South? Are you going to wait for me? Are you going to count the days without leaving your room? At the start of the school year, I'll be here. And we'll get back to normal life. Wait for me! Do you want to go home alone? - No. My mother didn't have time. She gave birth to me in the kitchen. It's true! I swear! I weighed 4 kilos! My head wouldn't pass. But as you can see, I've melted in the sun since then. What about you, where were you born? In hospital? Were you born here? You must have been born somewhere. - Yes, somewhere. - You don't know where you were born? - But do you know what to learn for French tomorrow? - Won't you tell me? - Rodrigue's soliloquy. Act III Scene 4. One page. - Evening, Julien. - Evening. - Why don't you ever take the lift? Doesn't your father want you to? Or are you training for the Olympics? - I have an appointment! - Oh really? - I've got homework. I want to know what all the other kids know. What day I was born. How— How my parents met. I'm a kid like the others. I shared in the insult, I sought out its author, I saw him, I avenged my honor and my father; - They're never thin enough. You digest them badly because they're never thin enough. - I would do it again if I had it to do. - If you can't digest cucumbers don't eat them. - My father has problems. - He's not the only one. We all have problems. Especially me. Right now I have one big problem who won't stop messing about while I'm doing dinner. - It is to offer thee my blood that thou seest me in this place. - If only I had knives that could actually cut. But I shouldn't dream. We'll keep this one until the blade falls off the handle. I'll be gone before then. - You always say you're going. - The day that happens, you'll have a hard time without me. Who would cook for you? - We'll go to a restaurant. - I doubt that. It's not your father style. - Not my father's style. In the meantime, if you're going to go to tidy your room! I'm not going to go to tidy my room, I'm going to tidy my room. I did my duty then, I still do it now. Everything's ready in the oven. The receipts are in the wallet. What should I buy for tomorrow? - Sorry? - At the market tomorrow. What shall I buy? - Something fresh. Just the usual, Maryse. - Very well. Good night Sir. - Good night. Julien! I'm ready for you! Did your day go well? - Pretty good, Dad. - What were your marks today? - 14 out of 20 in Geography. - What was that for? - Japan. - 14 isn't enough. - Yes Dad. - Was that your only mark today? - I obtained an 18 in Latin. - Obtained? - I got an 18 in Latin. - I'll look at it later. Come and sit beside me. Julien— Japan— It's far away. - Yes Dad. - Yes. Julien, I need to talk to you. Later, after dinner. We'll talk after dinner. Go on, off you go now. Leave me. Julien! We're fine together, aren't we? - Yes Dad. We're fine together. We're fine— Together— I'd like to talk to you. To talk to you. To talk to you. Julien. For your 12th birthday, we're going to have the apartment painted. - Thank you Dad! Thanks a lot. - Now, sleep well. You're as beautiful as an angel. - I'll be late. - Have a good one. There you are. Well? No hug? So, do you have any friends? - Yes. - Yes, but— Real ones? Not just buddies, or classmates? You've got some? - I have. - A lot? - Three. - Ah, friends are precious. You have to take care of them. Lonely people become very sad. Or ugly. - I know. - Oh, you know so many things. Wow, you're a good dancer! A week is too long, you know. I missed you. - I missed you too. - Did you? Really? You know, every Wednesday you're different. You don't realise, but— - Really? - Yes, I'm telling you. And it's those little variations that are beautiful, you know. This is our secret story. It's our diary. Do you know what a personal diary is? - Yes, I'm keeping one. - So what do you write in your personal diary? Apart from personal things, of course. - Well, whatever comes into my head. Poems too. - Poems— And about important things that happen to you, yes? - Yes. - So what important thing happened this week? - I don't know. - I'm sure something special happened to you? At school? Right? With your father? Your father didn't tell you anything? Do you know what day it'll be in a month? - Yes. - You realize? You'll be 12! My big Julien. You'll soon be a little man. - Why are you looking at me like that? - You know, at 12— we start to look life in the eye. We start to understand more things. Not all, but many. There are a lot of things we never talked about together. There are a lot of questions you ask yourself. Silently. How was she before? She has changed. Her smile, Her hair maybe. You're all mine. Have we been asleep for long? - Yes. - What time is it? - Four. - We have a very short half-hour left. Go on. Here. You're feverish. Three minutes, OK? Allo? Allo, Michel? Yes. No, well, I had a phone call just now. Very good! That'll make him happy. Yes. On Sunday? Thursday 21ˢᵗ, Julien came back to me with a fever. I had to call the doctor. He prescribed a day's rest. Once again, may I remind you that Julien is a delicate child. And that it is my duty to protect him. Consequently— No, if you want, we'll talk about it on Sunday. OK Michel, it's nice of you. Take care too. I think the next visit should be postponed for a week. On a side note, I received your letters. As you can imagine, they didn't make me happy. If I haven't answered you before, it was to spare you some hard words. I have nothing more to tell you. I don't know what's got into you. But what you're proposing is just inconceivable. I'd rather not think about it. I advise you to do the same. Every Wednesday, I have to use to the thermometer. Before going there and after coming back. That reassures Dad. 36.9. You can get dressed. Julien, on his second birthday Yes, I'm snooping around. Especially in my Dad's room. I know it's wrong. I snoop as little as possible. But my father's life concerns me. I want to know what was there before. Before— Julien, your bath's ready. Here you are. Come on, your water will get cold. What are you doing in here again? Nosy little devil. There's nothing for you here. Nothing at all. You're going to work? - Yes. - I'll come and switch off your light. Your father's waiting for you. Go on! She wants to take you back. She wants to take you back! And that can't be. It can't be. She's taking me to court! - Yes Dad. - She has no right to take you back. She doesn't have that right. When she left, it was me who took care of you. It was the condition of her leaving. The condition! She has no rights. I took care of you, you understand? It was me. I took care of you. I brought you up. I gave you everything. And now. Now—threats! Demands! Accusations! But you'll stay here with me, Julien. I won't let you go. No. - I understand. - She doesn't have the right. How dare she? It's—It's— It's intolerable! How dare she take me to court? How dare she take me to court? - Mum loves me. So do you. - Go back to your room. Go on, leave me. Leave me. She may love you— but that doesn't stop her being a whore. And at that point, Maria passes the spinach. He takes a large spoonful of spinach. And poof! On to the book, right in the middle of the book. And he slams the book shut. Everyone, petrified— That was him, Fernand. And is school going well, Julien? - Yes, Aunt. - Here Julien, pass your uncle a slice of bread, please. - Thank you, big boy. Tell me again, Jean, What was the name of that Husserl specialist? At University? - Lothar Kelkel. - The one who wanted to kill his wife? She had left him just before. Fortunately. - And what about French History? Does it interest you? - A lot! - That's really good, Julien. I don't think you can understand the world if you don't know History. Never forget that, my boy. - I'll remember it. - I'll recall it and I'll remember it. - Ah, Aunt Lucienne, you've always been good at grammar. Oh, it looks great. Wonderful! Am I doing equal portions? No, a small one for me, as you know. - Oh that's right! The biggest for me. - A portion fit for a Norman. There you go! - What an angel! He's lucky to be with his father. It couldn't have been easy every day, could it? You show courage and selflessness. I admire you. You know Julien, I'm suffocating here. I think I'm really going to leave. - We'll have coffee in the living room. - I know. Like every Sunday. You know what would be nice here, Jean? A good coat of paint throughout the flat. Does cigar smoke bother you? - No, my dear. Do you want one? - No. - We're going to paint everything for my birthday. - Is that so? That would be the first time anything changed here. Yes yes. - It's a very very good idea to repaint everything. - Oh it will be brighter, that's for sure. How your uncle would have loved you— But— He left too soon. Goodbye Lucienne. - Goodbye Jean. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - And thank you. - And to you. Have a safe trip back. - Goodbye Julien. You should rest, you don't look well. - I'll go down with Uncle Michel. - OK. Don't go out in the street. - No no. It's true, he looks pale. He's suffering so much? After more than ten years? - We can't imagine. I speak as I find. He doesn't deserve this pain because of a woman like her. - Uncle Michel, I wanted to ask you— - Ask away. - How long were my parents married? - What a weird question. Why don't you ask your parents? Sorry. Tell me, Julien, how old are you? - I'm 12. - Do you really want to know? Three years, little nosy-parker. Three long years. - How did they meet? Who loved the other first? Who loved the most? - Stop it Julien. - Were you at the wedding? Why did she leave? - Don't, Julien, you're only hurting yourself. Come on. Go back upstairs. Your father will be worried, go on. We're going to fight. My mother wants me to live with her. My father wants to keep me, of course. It's war. They'll destroy everything. Your mother? She's too—You don't know her. - Too what? - I don't know. She's too much, that's all. - She loves you. She wants you with her. It's human. - Yes of course. And my father, what will become of him? You! I warned you! I don't want to see you here any more! Do you have to fight like this? - I'm just trying to prove myself worthy of God. - Go and find God somewhere else! We don't see your mother often. I don't even think I've ever met her. Where is she? - She's travelling. - What's she like? - What? - Physically? - She's beautiful. - Is she blonde? You miss her? - No. Why would I miss her? - At least you're lucky because you love her. Because I hate my mother. Feldman got an 18 again. Do you know what Mr Boilard said to him? "Don't keep getting up, Feldman. Through always being first, you'll end up stiff and sore." It was funny. - Is it warm there? - Yes Dad. The house is well heated. - Better than here, I suppose. - Stop it, Dad. Please. Stop. - I'll stop sooner than you think, seriously. Sit up straight. Straight! Elbows! Have you finished your meat? - Yes Dad. Chew it! Chew! Chew! Come to my house, we'll get peace to fight. Don't worry, she's my sister, she's used to it. You can take off your shirt. Anything goes. There are no rules. My name's Eric. - I'm Julien. What is it? - We don't punch in the face. - Why not? - I don't want marks. - You can punch me wherever you want. What are all these bruises? Have you been in a fight? - No. - Don't tell me No. Someone's beaten you up, you're covered in bruises. Look at this! There—And there—And there— If someone punched you, you should tell me, little man. - No one punched me! - You expect me to believe that? You can tell me everything. - I fell down the stairs. - How did you manage to do that? - I slipped. - I believe you. Look at me. What's up, my Julien? Listen, I'm here. I trust you. I know it's very difficult. And you? You trust me? - Yes. - So everything's fine. I'm here. My little king. Shall we go? What is it? Your face fell all of a sudden. I don't like seeing you like this. You remind me of someone. - Who? - Sorry, forget it. What I'm saying is stupid. You can get dressed. Mothers love their son. Sons love their mother. Why does everything have to change? Why now? What are you doing here? - I was thirsty. - In the dark? - I didn't want to wake you up. - I wasn't sleeping. Do you want some herbal tea? - Yes. Do you like your room? - Yes. - Are you missing anything? - No. - Julien, I started a journey with you. We're about halfway through that journey. The forthcoming years are the most important. Why? I'll tell you. I'm no longer speaking to the child, but to the adult you'll become. To the man being born within you. We have so much to bring to one another. To each other. I think— It's a fundamental exchange. We should not destroy it. At your age, I didn't have the chance to have this exchange, this discussion, with my dad. He died too soon. I've hired a lawyer. Everything will be fine. You can sleep peacefully. I see some good years ahead of us. This shutter needs oiling, doesn't it? Will it bother you? - Only a little. - All right, we have to sleep now. It's late. Go on. - Dad! I like it here. - Go to sleep quickly. - You too. Coming! - It's me. - What are you doing here? - I was looking at some photos. - They're beautiful, aren't they? - Yes Mum. - Yes. You're my boy. I'm so glad you're here! Oh, sorry! Are you OK? Don't you have school this morning? - Yes I do. - Then you're crazy. Completely crazy! Wow, feel my heart beating! You know— Yesterday, when you left— I was so sad, I ran after you. There was so much I wanted to tell you. - Me too. So we didn't dare. We can be so stupid sometimes. It was a very difficult decision for me, you know— You know—I thought about it a lot beforehand. I didn't want to inflict all this fighting, all this heartbreak on you. But I had no choice. I wrote your father dozens of letters. And he never answered me. He cornered me. You know him. He's not easy. He's a difficult man. Right? - Yes. - But that's not the issue. I wanted to tell you— You see, your father will always be your father. It's an unbreakable bond. I don't want to break it— You can visit him if you want. You can go and sleep there. Saturdays, Sundays. I'll never stop you, you know. But a boy's place— is with his mother. Children live with their mother. Their mother exists only for them. Do you understand that? It's the Law of Nature. It's the Law, period. Everyone knows that, you know. Except your father. Come on. My boy. Now it's up to the judge to decide. Don't be afraid. Everything will be settled at the end of the month, you'll see. We're going to have a house of our own. What are you doing here? - Nothing! - It's always nothing with you. I'll be back at 6:30. Open, please! I won't do anything to you. I won't tell anyone. I just want to look inside. Forgive me, I hurt you. I just want to look inside. Were you in on the secret? You were in it together, weren't you? She told you she wanted to take you back. You knew that, didn't you? Answer me. - No! - No what? - I didn't know. - I want the truth, Julien! - It is the truth, I swear to God! - Leave God where he is. God has nothing to do with this. If you're setting yourself against me too, now— Go back to your room. I don't want to see you. You'll go to bed with no dinner. Did you hear what I said? Go! You're not helping me, Julien. You're not helping me. Seriously. - I didn't know! - OK! OK, I believe you. - I didn't know! I didn't know! It's the truth, I didn't lie to you! Never! I never lied to you! - Calm down! - So why are you accusing me? - Calm down, calm down! That's not how I brought you up. Pull yourself together. Go. What do you want to do with your life? Before the worms eat your brains out? What do you want to become? - You'll find out soon enough. Look at your legs. You're starting to have real man legs. Last night I showed I'm unworthy of you, Julien. I accused you unfairly. I would like to apologize. Do you accept? - Yes Dad. - Very good. It's forgotten. I know you are an honest and upright boy. Sit down. Education is not only a matter of affection. There is also education of thought, of honesty, of sense of duty. In a word—moral. Later, in philosophy class— Do you know what philosophy is? - Yes. - Well, you might find a German philosopher who wrote a sentence that has guided and helped me a lot in my life. I would like you to learn it. It is not the path that is difficult, but the difficult that is the path. What marks today? - 16 in history, 18 in geometry. - Congratulations, my boy. But you can do better. Work is our only redemption. What do I want to become in life? To be admirable. Dad. I want to stay with you. - Of course you'll stay here. You're beautiful. In a few years, you'll be driving women crazy. Look at me. - Mum? - Yes? - I feel good with you. - You mean it? Do you want to live with me? - Yes. Well—Shall we shoot some photos? ♪ Happy Birthday Julien, ♪ ♪ Happy birthday. ♪ ♪ Happy Birthday Julien, ♪ ♪ Happy birthday! ♪ Well? Go ahead, blow them out! - Blow! Happy birthday, my big boy. You'll be married in four years. In four years or in a hundred years. - Twelve years old, almost a man. - Well, you're a year older, Julien. Happy birthday. - There we are. Happy Birthday. - Thank you thank you thank you! Michel, can you open the Champagne, please? Oh my God, we nearly forgot the Champagne. - What kind of cake is this? - Vacherin. We've been having Vacherin on the boy's birthday for the last ten years! It brings you luck! It brings you luck! There. - Just a little for me. For me, a big one fit for a Norman. - And the hero of the party. Tell us, Julien— What do you want to do when you're grown up? Do you have any idea? - Michel. - Yes? - Doctor. - Doctor? - He's right, Julien has all the qualities to become a great doctor. - No no! He'll be a teacher, like his grandfather, won't he? He can be a doctor as well as a teacher. Why not? If Julien works hard, he can achieve anything. Right? Who wants another glass of this wonderful Champagne? - Not me, I'm already tipsy. - Thanks. - Julien, could you tell Maryse to bring the coffee here, please? He takes after you so much. He's such a good little boy. You're lucky, you know. There you go, Happy Birthday, Julien. Here. - Thank you thank you thank you! - I hope you'll use it a lot. We're going to repaint. We're going to repaint everything. Put it here. Close it. It's that simple. Magic, right? - Can I try? - Of course. Oh good. A little more—Yes—That's it! What did you do this week that was important? Julien, you're going to be late! Hey! Not like this! When I grow up, I'm going to be a warrior. I'm made to command. To fight and conquer! Now you! What makes you happy in life? I mean, what makes you really happy? Think. Think of one thing that would make you forget everything. - Swimming - In the pool? - In the pool and in the sea. I'd swim far out, for a long time. Let myself be carried by the waves. I'd talk to the sea, tell it my plans. I'd like to caress it, same as it caresses me. I'm all alone, I'm fine. Warmed by the sun. I look at the sky. - And—do you ever have a wank? - What? - I mean—do you rub yourself? Do you jerk off? - No. - You should, it's good. You know what it's called when the man jerks off inside the woman and he comes? - No. - The little death. It sounds like a dream, doesn't it? And when we fight, what do you think about? - Nothing. It's as if I were someone else. - Someone else? - Like I'm not really me. Get up! Get up, I said! Defend yourself! Defend yourself! Come on! Defend yourself— It's not worth you coming back. You'll never be a warrior. The maid is leaving. There'll be another one by autumn. Should it be cold water or boiling water? Their explanations are never clear. Let's go! - Dad? I'm not a coward, am I? - What are you talking about? - Am I a coward? - Of course not Julien. Why do you say that? What's going on with you? - Nothing. - Now is not the time for weakness. Next Tuesday, you're not going to school. I'll write you a note. We have an appointment, the two of us. At the court. These days, judges ask children for their opinion. We can talk it over if you want. - Tuesday? - Yes, Tuesday. Also, I wanted to tell you, the painters will be here tomorrow morning. While they're there, you can sleep in the maid's room on the 6th floor. - What about you? - I'll go to the hotel next door. It's on the corner. I won't be far away. They think they love each other. But that's going too far. It's waiting, getting hurt. It's hoping. It's shutting up. It's leaving. It's coming back. It's getting lost. And it's coming back again. It's always leaving. What does your father do? - He's a civil engineer. - What's that? - He builds bridges. Draws up plans for roads, dams— He transforms the landscape. - You're proud of your dad, aren't you? What about your mother? - My mother wants me to go and live with her. - What does your father say about that? - He's fighting it. My mother's taking him to court. - Your mother's tough! - She loves me. - Is he going to lose, do you think? - Come on, let's take some pictures. - Don't be so sad. All in all, you're probably not unhappy. - I'm not sad. - Sorry, but you don't always look very cheerful. - Look at me. Look deep into my eyes. What do you see? - Nothing. It's all green, like the sea. With black dots. And there's some kind of dark stripes. Bits of red—yellow— And lots and lots of green. Eat it while it's hot. - Mm, delicious! What's today? Friday or Saturday? - Sunday. - Yeah. Tomorrow's Monday. - You can't make a good omelette without breaking eggs. - I get confused with all the work going on. I hope it's all over soon because— Because I get lost. Frankly. She says she wants to take you back "because she loves you". But that's not true. It's just a pretext. She's never known how to love. She's ambitious. You understand? And you, you're just a youthful mistake in her artistic career. Today, all of a sudden, she says she wants to live with you. As if she misses you. I'm telling you— She clings to you because— she's alone— and the years are going by. So— She's chasing after her youth, you know? And since she's afraid, she goes on the attack. She—She's hurting. She won't stop until I'm down on my knees. Because she wants that too. She wants to humiliate me. She wants to humiliate me. To destroy what I've built with you, day by day. For ten years. But I won't let her. No. No. To love is to be there, on call, every minute, every hour, day and night. It's waking you up in the morning, watching you sleep. It's learning— to do your homework with you. It's taking care of you when you're ill. It' s watching you grow. So who should be looking after you? Who? Her? The one who left? And who only thinks of herself? Or me? The one who devoted himself to you. Totally. Who? Who? - It's the Law. - The Law? What Law? Who invented it? Who wrote it? Fuck the Law. I'm the master in my house. No one will come and take what I hold most dear! No one! I'll tell her on Tuesday! I'll also tell her that she's wearing me out. Of course, there are still a few odds and ends to be done, but— It'll be finished by the end of August. Amazing, isn't it? You didn't expect a palace like this! - It's wonderful. - Come on, have a look at your room. This is mine— And this is yours. - It's amazing. - You mean that? You're happy? - It's amazing. - You'll be all right here? - Oh yes! Oh yes! Oh yes! Yes, yes! Oh look. What's he doing here all alone? And why's he watching us like that? - Come on, let's go and get him. Come here, come on! Come here! Come on! Come on, don't be afraid. Come! What's your name? - Julien. - Do you want to hug the bride? - It'll bring you luck. No, come back! Julien, come on, let's dance together. Tonight no one has any right to be sad. Julien! What are you doing here? What do you want? - Is Julien there? - No. He hasn't come here? You haven't seen him? - No. Why would you think he's here? I'm telling you he's not here. But if you want to have a look— Look. - He's missing. I went up to his room to say goodnight. The bed was empty. So. - Come in. - No. - Did he say anything to you? - No. You? - Me? No. Of course not. How has he been the last few days? Was he worried? Did he talk to you a bit? Julien? Are you here? - I was thirsty. - Where were you? I looked everywhere. - Please forgive me. - But why did you vanish like that? Where were you going with that suitcase? - Please forgive me, Dad. - Julien, my little boy. You scared me, you know? - I won't do it again. - Don't be afraid, I'm with you, you know. I didn't know this, but our lawyer had a small victory. A delay. Judgment postponed to July. That way we can both go to the seaside. Can you imagine? Allo? No. Yes, he's fine. He had a moment of confusion, I think. Yes. No, no. I'm telling you he's fine. Then don't insist. You'll see him on Wednesday. Constantly— As if I was the monster. - I'm going to bed. Good night Dad. - You're right. Good night. Did you have a good day? - Yes Dad. - What about your marks? - There was no school today. - No school? Why not? - The holidays started this morning. - Ah yes, that's right, the holidays. Yes of course. - Feldman got the headmaster's commendation. I'll get it next year. I'll work harder. I'll work more. - What will become of me if you leave? - I'll stay here. - Of course. Of course. Then we'll find a new maid, and— and curtains. - And carpets? - Carpets? - Yes, big, coloured carpets. - If you want. On Thursday we'll go to the Grand Théâtre and on Saturday to the cinema. - And on Sunday, we'll do philosophy. Are you leaving on Sunday? - Look at this one, it's good, isn't it? This will be our last goodbye. - That's Maryse, the maid. The former maid. She left. Dad'll replace her at the start of the school year. Look at this one, it's good, isn't it? - It's my favourite. I don't want you to suffer. I did all this just for you. Only for you. My love. - I have to go. - Yes I know. Goodbye. - Yeah. - Come back to me soon! Write to me! It's always raining when we come here. Maybe we should go back? - Yes, maybe, yes. Deep breaths! Come on! Can you feel how bracing the air is here? Come on, once more! Home seems so far away now. - Yes. Are you crying, Dad? - No. It's the wind. Doesn't the ocean looks wonderful in the rain? On Thursday— On Thursday, I'll know if we get to stay together. Look, the weather's improving. They're knackered. You can't go there. It's just intolerable! On Thursday— On Thursday, I'll know if we get to stay together. One for Dad! You can't go there. It's just intolerable! One for Mum! Write to me! One for Grandma. Tomorrow, I want there to be a big blue sky, a calm sea and no wind. Can I go swimming early tomorrow? - Be careful, then. - I won't stay out too long. I won't catch a cold. Don't worry. - What are you reading at the moment? - Moby Dick. It's a beautiful book. My name is Ishmael. Sleep well. My boy! English subtitles by jeremys and Marseille TNT 2023
