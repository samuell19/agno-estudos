BEING 17 first trimester Let's play. Oscar, you pick the yellow team. Gregory, the blue team. Choose your teammates. Victor. Hugo. Thomas. Cyprien. Yoann. Amaury. Pick one of them. Thomas. Damien. Summer evenings blue I will roam rustic paths, pricked by wheat, crushing thin grass. Dreaming, I'll feel its coolness underfoot. I'll let the breeze bathe my bare head. I will not speak. I'll think of nothing. But infinite love will rise in me and I will wander far, very far, like a vagabond, in nature, like a woman's company. Thank you, Damien. - Good day? - Yeah, and you? Flus. And you? Rimbaud. I prefer when it's longer. - Our mosquito nets came. - Fancy! Some soldiers got malaria. Taking your Nivaquine? Yes, Doctor! - Want me to go? - Yes, please. Later, son. Love you. He's making it romantic for us. New blouse? Like it? I'm glad you noticed. I notice everything. Coming home for Christmas? I hear rumors but I don't want to disappoint you again. I'll prepare the house for you. I feel so alone in bed. Wearing the red bra? - How do you know? - I don't. Just a feeling. Polo? Don't jump in all gung-ho. Protect your face or it'll get messed up. That's one thing. Second, never face on. Always at an angle. And you... bear down on your legs. Third thing... your fingers. This way, they'll get broken. Keep them a little curved in. Get it? This time bear down on your legs. Get in position. Strike. You're more grounded. Feel it? Harder, go all out. Push, push! Damn, you're wound up! Grab onto me and knock me over. Good! Excellent! - Don't turn him into a dumb soldier. - Dumb, no. I have an emergency in Le Casset. Don't wait up. Careful of avalanches. - I'm a big girl. - Hope so. Don't forget to get paid! Hello. Dr. Delille? We'll walk. The car won't make it. - Leaving will be hard. - I'll come turn it around. Great, thanks. We put her in here. It's warmer. - So what's wrong? - I feel exhausted. What else? Take a deep breath. A pulmonary infection. I get nauseous in the morning, several weeks now. Morning sickness? It began a month ago. Then the fever started. You can lie back down. I used Metacam for her fever. I don't know it. An anti-inflammatory for animals. Isn't it okay if you respect the dose? Practical, if it's all you have. Clever but potentially dangerous. He wants to be a vet. That's funny. I grew up in the country. My parents were farmers. Grain, not cattle like you. Are you allergic to penicillin? You from around here? No, from the Beauce. Doctor! Here. To thank for having come. And for letting us pay later. Thanks, I'm fine. I'll kill it myself. It's not too much? No, he'll like it. Come here. Hold on, Damien. Put this on. I don't want you sick. Hello. - You come by foot? - By foot and bus. - How long does it take? - An hour and a half. - What dedication! - I like the mountains. I'll have your mom's antibiotics today. I'll call her. Goodbye. Minus 2x squared... plus... plus 2x... Minus 12. All right. And then? Then... Can anyone help? Damien, to the board. A second-degree equation. That makes... minus 2x squared plus 2x plus 12 equals zero. Delta equals B squared minus 4ac. You're dumber than I thought. Just two more solutions to find. Abscissa and intersection points. And the ordinates. Take your seat. Everyone, get working. What's going on, Damien? What happened to you? What did you do? I fell. You fell. Think I buy that? What about Damien? He did nothing? You just fell out of the blue? So? So nothing. He's not on line. Hold on... Come and see. Ready? Taste this. To die for. - I knew that chicken. - What? I saw it die. That house call at the farm. Mrs. Chardoul. Chardoul? Do you know Thomas? He's in my grade. - Paid in poultry now? - Not my idea. You have to help the entire world. What can I say? It's my job. Which is why you should get paid. What's he like? Who? That kid in your grade. Thomas. Always alone. Left farming school to study science. - He's adopted. - I have no idea. He wants to become a vet. You seem in the know. I liked him a lot. He's handsome. The girls must like him. He's not into girls. Or anyone else. I'll give you his mom's medicine. It'll save me a trip. The way he twisted its neck! And you laugh. Yep. Take note of the empty vials' mass to calculate the density afterwards. From my mom. I mean, the doctor. Beat it. Why? So they don't see me with you. Damien... Go for the face hand flat out, rapid-fire. Go for the body too. The body now. Stop. Not bad. Physically you've progressed. Now work your attitude. - My attitude? - You sound all girly. I got your meds. Antibiotics and paracetamol. Feel better? - Fever's down. - No, it's the same. So, 3 times a day for pain. This is one at noon, one at night. This too. She wrote you a letter. "Christine, remember your pregnancy test." Put that away. See better? - Can I ask a question? - Go on. Did Mom get pregnant before me? Several times. But it never lasted. Or I wouldn't be here. Yeah, you wouldn't. Go and see if it works. And be careful. Help him. Help him up. Guys! Stop it! Cool it. Stop it! It's over now. Go there. You, there. Hello, ma'am. Have a seat. As I said, Thomas and Damien fought during gym. - It's not the first time. - How so? But I hope it's the last. Or I'll try more severe measures, like suspension. For both of you. Now Thomas, let me ask you something. You're slipping scholastically. Low grades. Teachers say you're apathetic. You cut yourself off. Anything wrong? And where are you parents? Thomas' mother is sick. Take the efforts he makes into consideration. 2 hours back and forth to school, farm work at night. Thomas was offered room and board. He said no. Right? Why? I like it up there. What can I say? Can you step out, Thomas? Can you tell us why the two of you fight so often? - We don't get along. - I'm sorry. That's no reason to fight. There's more. It's just your mom, me, you. Speak freely. Does Thomas bully you? For you it's obvious who's guilty? This may be about bullying, which is much more serious. It's hypothetical, but Thomas fits the bully profile. What's a bully profile for you? For example he knocked Damien over for no reason. This time I hit first. Get in. I said to get in. Too much snow to make it up there. I'll manage. Get in. Come on. I'm coming in to see your mother. Christine, did you do the test? - The pregnancy test. - No need. If I change antibiotics, I need to know. No need, I said. I won't take the risk. If I'm pregnant, it's already dead. I won't leave until you take it. Down! Damien! Why didn't you stay in the car? Tom! Promise me you'll stop fighting. Shake hands. Go on, shake hands! Better than that. Shake for real. I need a word with you. Your mom will spend a few days in hospital. She's pregnant. Are you sure? Of course. Hello, son. - Good to see you. - Same here. You haven't caught up yet. You'll be taller soon enough. Safe trip back? - Glad to be here? - You bet! I put a mirror there to lighten up the room. It makes it seem bigger. You went all out on the lights. - Don't like them? - I do. I got nervous! - Back in an hour. - Where are you off to? Workout with Polo. What is this new obsession? I want to learn self-defense. From what I hear, you're... not bad at offense. Like you. My profession has nothing to do with your little fights. Disliking someone violently, irrationally... I get it. But not assault and battery. Explain. It's over anyway. Glad to hear you say it. Stay. We need to talk. Sit down there. Tom's mother is in hospital. I suggested he come stay here for his schoolwork. - Why didn't you tell me? - I am now. Why are you doing this? He'll never get by, with his 3-hour commutes. He deserves help. And you said it's over anyway. He'll never want to come. - Why not? - He hates me. How can anyone not like you? Hold on. Let's go for a ride. - Can you teach me to drive? - See this snow? Not today. Next time. Polo wants to buy your car. It's not for sale. Let's go say hi to Polo. Come on. Hello, Tom. I'm Damien's father. How are you? - Hello! - Sir... - The road wasn't too hard? - It was okay. Good. - Coffee? - I'd love some. - Is that a bear? - Sure is. You should see the bear at the Toulouse Museum. He died two weeks ago. He probably fell, though no autopsy results yet. Want some? I saw a bear once. At night during a snowstorm. You dreamt it! Study instead of wandering the woods. Have a seat. Can you get the honey? Staying at your place will do him good. It's only normal. Tom doesn't seem thrilled. Why should I live there? Your own room. Near school, the hospital. Conducive to good work. I want to be here while you're sick. And I want you to graduate. You dislike my son but... I don't care about him. Watch your mouth! He's here to help. I don't need help. Believe it or not, I do. Can you give me a hand? - Pilot in the Air Force? - No, the Army. 80% of helicopter pilots are in the Army. Why choose that? At 17, I knew I'd fly. It was a no-brainer. Fighter pilot? I wasn't into the fighter part. But airline pilot was too humdrum for me. I needed adventure. I chose officer training school. - So the Army. - Yeah... If I flunk, I'll join the Foreign Legion. See the world. What about veterinarian? With my grades, I think vet is history. I don't think so. You can't give up in life. There's my tree. See? Never lose hope! Nice, isn't it? I found my tree for Polo! second trimester Stuck? I'm fine. Both hung up on the same problem. Because you distract us. I was the queen of trigonometry. Great student, I bet. My parents went broke sending me to private school. I had to be first, best grades. I was very unhappy. I'm going to see Polo. Take Tom. Or else you don't go. Polo! We'll work on dodging. Tom, try to touch him first. Then switch off. Get in position. Protect your face, Tom. Start. Nice dodge, Damien. Tom, try again. Try to get him. Damien, keep moving. That's nice. Good going, but don't get carried away. Once more? Get in position. Let's go. Touch. Boy or girl? A girl. I can't wait to go home. When do you get out? 3 days, but I think you should stay at the doctor's. It's more convenient for school. And she can check your work. I want to help Dad and take care of you. I miss the mountains. I have home care every other day. The doctor saw to it. She sees to everything. It's better like this. Isn't it? Yeah, it's better. We can move! Mom wants another room. Why another room? No fucking way! Pregnant? Just an idea. And we're not old! - You wouldn't like it? - Not really! And I like this place. It won't be till I'm back. Think again. Are you flying these days? It's been 5 days. Dust in the turbine. Miracle it lasted so long. No spare parts. Piece of junk! Respect the equipment, brat! Get spare parts from the Americans. You said they trade in booze. Barter with your beer. - Good deal for them. - They do help us. But they left 2 weeks ago. We're alone. One of them left me his baseball cap. Like it? - Not bad. - It's for you. Really? Cool, thanks. Was it at least in combat? Hold on... Stinks enough. Gross. Say "ahh". Perfect. Other one. Perfect. Strep throat. In a few days you'll be fine. Get dressed. Strong at the farm, at death's door here. See your mom yesterday? She needs bed rest but this time should be fine. She seems to think so too. Finally a real child. There are no fake children. If you're sick tonight, Physics tomorrow? Smells like weed. Don't smoke if you're sick. What'll my mom say? Let me show you something. Are you afraid? Come. So... Is this how you did it? Wanted her to take care of you? You're into pity? Tell me... Was it nice? When she examined you? You get hard? Not here! Yeah, not here. I'll choose the place. Coming? Let's continue. Not in the rain. We'll stop. Hard rain doesn't last long. I want to go to the lake. For a swim. Know it? It's too cold. What took you two so long? I saw my dad at the farm. I saw Polo. No muscles despite the training. That's not true. - Still can't arm-wrestle! - Bullshit. Let's see. Ready? So, one... What a cheater! - Tom's turn now. - Come on. You sure? Ready, guys? So... Ready, set, go! Yeah, he's strong. What's for dinner? I was waiting for you. I'll make pasta. Was your husband supposed to leave so soon? No, but one call and within 24 hours, you're off. Army comes first. For how long? 4-month mission. Any news? They have orders to say all's well. Cheers! Can I ask you something? - Why did you trip me in class? - Drop it. Old news. It would help me to know. I can't say why. I found you pretentious. I didn't like how you kept staring. I keep staring now too. I guess I got used to it. Like your earring. Don't like my earring? I'm working. Can you go away? - What are you doing? - Daylight savings time. I'll hand you back your mock exams. It's Tom who got the highest grade. Would you like to come up here? I'm happy to give you this... 15 out of 20. The subject was difficult, the conflicts and tensions in the Middle East. Your essay was very good. Congratulations, very good work. Now, Chloé. Your grade is a little less high: 9. Almost the average. Next time you'll have to work on your methodology. Can you drive? Yeah, why? Can you take me somewhere? Can't you see I'm working? For once I ask a favor. I insist. I'm not some spoiled kid's slave! Should I show this to my mom? Stay on 618. Turn at the intersection. To the left. Where are we? In fact it wasn't far. Wait here. Yeah, it was easy. - How old are you? - 19. You're too young. - I'm 19. - You are not. You lied too. You're not 25. You're right. I lie too. I round it down. Live here alone? It was too good to be true. People don't come here till summer. Fresh blood. A bit too fresh. Had sex before? We can kiss. Let's go. Is all this yours? - Livestock housing? - Yes. Can you give me a tour? How much cattle in all? 130 here and more at my Dad's place. Including the calves, about 200. - They never graze? - Different system. - No hoof trouble? - I wash them daily. What are the blue tags? Badges for the smart doors. What are smart doors? There are 3 zones. It makes it easy for them. Sleep zone with mattresses. When they're hungry, a smart door regulates their movement. It sends them to be milked or fed. The smart door chooses based on milking potential. Her estimated production: She's at 1. Same thing, udder by udder. All channeled to the milk tank. They go in by themselves. No food or water otherwise. For either, they have to get milked. Average production? Some produce 130 pounds a day. Day and night? 24/7, 365 days a year. You made a nice friend. He told me why you went. Surprised? Nothing you do surprises me. I don't know if I'm into guys or just you. You were more his type. Did he try to fuck? No one fucks with me! Don't forget it. Go straight after the tunnel. - Why are you here? - If Tom can't drive... We need to get your dad's car home. I hope it's not serious. How did he fall? Move your fingers. - Does it hurt here? - No. Here? Here? Let's go. Both of you, sit. Not there. You here... And you here. Take off your shirt. Move it. What's this? Take off yours too. Help him. What are all these bruises? They're not recent. You fought! Where did you do it? In the mountains. A place I know. Has this crap been going on long? Tomorrow you go home. Wait. Let me. I'm hungry. Aren't you? Yes. Thanks. For not saying where we were. It wasn't easy. She kept insisting. She wants to know everything. But she doesn't. No one does. Except you. What will you tell them? Excellent grades, no need to stay anymore. And for this? You fell, that's all. It's okay. Okay meaning what? Tell me. Cut the officialese. There was more ground fighting. Our guys took it bad. Radicals prefer hand-to-hand combat. They know choppers mean more casualties. If we open fire, we can hit our men. We went in 3 times today for our wounded. A sergeant took a rocket in the stomach. He's gone. It was tough. Squadron came back full of bullet holes. - But I'm fine. - Nathan, my God. They can't hold out long anyway. Their forces are dwindling. They'll retreat north. We'll be able to relax. Play volleyball again. It's fun. The whole base plays. Pilots and mechanics formed a team. The general promised a 45-pound ham to the winners. They're damned motivated. Nice change from mess-hall. So? How about you? I miss you. I miss you too. I wear your perfume. They tease me. So what? It makes me happy. I have a briefing at command center. Duty calls. Me too. I have patients waiting. I love you. I love you too. Exile & Migrations Now we're going to study the first packet - right over here. Can you pass these out please? And then we're going to write an essay on the theme, OK? Yes, come in. Tomas! You're so late! I'm sorry. C'mon man! What happened? I broke my wrist. No no no! I want it in Spanish, please. Now what happened? Yes... I... have a... married wrist. 'Casada' is wrong because 'casada' means 'married'. You see? You must say: Tengo la muñeca rota. Well you could do better than that but you're late enough as it is. Have a seat. OK let's go! You there, please read the cultural data aloud for the class. Between the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and the beginning of the Second World War, around 500,000 Spanish Republicans migrated to France in exile, and defended her against the Germans. OK, great job! Can someone else read the next part? Take him to the infirmary. I bit my tongue. Principal told me everything. Tom's expelled. For a head-butt? He could have broken your jaw. You'd be like this. - I felt nothing. - Nonsense. It's excruciating. Open your mouth. I'll check. No need to say "ahh". You don't need stitches. You'll gargle. The nurse said so too. Is he really expelled? It's only normal. Come in. I was wrong to ask him here. You didn't fight back. Why did he hit so hard? I tried to kiss him. Nothing to say? No, I'm listening. And what's to say? I got kicked out. Say what? Expelled. What did you do? Too late. It's done. It's better this way. How about exams? How will you graduate? I'll study from home. Don't worry. I learned how to work. Not a word to your mother. Why not? She'll get nervous. No use. For the baby? I hope this one... will make you happy. third trimester Principal sent me home. The Army called to confirm our address. No fucking way. Good afternoon. I'm the regiment's social worker. Present arms! Halt. One. Three. Four. To the left. Left. Together, cushions down. Captain Nathan Delille, on behalf of the Defense Minister, we give you the Military Valor Cross, with palm. Captain Nathan Delille, on behalf of the President, we name you Knight of the Legion of Honor. To the fallen! Tom, come help me. Can you knot my tie? - Not ready? - I'm not going. You can't do that. My wrist still hurts. I'll stay with you. If I could go, I would. Let your mother do it... Go ahead. What a pain. Listen, Tom... He helped us. He took you in his home. So you're coming. In infinite sadness, I stand before you to salute my lifelong friend, to recall the memory of a husband, a father a friend whose brutal, glorious death leaves us mourning someone who was loving, protective and kind. Console your comrades who couldn't bring you back alive. Console your wife. Console your son, who lost his father, his hero. I wanted to say I'm with you. For your father. Stop! Let me go! Calm down! Try to rest. Hungry? Want some coffee? I'd love some. I'm glad you're here. I'll stay with her, while you're at school. She mustn't be alone. Polo will stop by. Polo is in the military. Not a good idea. I hate these clothes. Take some of mine. - Can I? - Sure, go on. I'm taking you out. I'm taking you out. - Thank you. - Why thank me? For saying nothing. I have no words. No one does, but they all talk. It's why I can't see his family or mine. Everyone talks, they say things will get better. I know they'll get better. I even hope so. But I also know that... I won't have accepted his death then. I'll just have forgotten he died. Every time I forget will be a time of joy. Followed by a time of pain, when I learn once again he's dead. You wanted to show me the mountains... Next time. Making sense of my notes? I don't want to get blocked. I know about being blocked. You got your room back? Look. My dad's watch. I'm scared to wear it. As for the tombstone, it'll be... a marble slab with an engraved headstone. - The simplest? - Yes. Or else something like... that vault, more ornate. No, the simplest. Like the one behind you. With the pink marble? How long will it take? 2-3 weeks, depending on the marble mason. Thanks, I couldn't have come alone. And Damien? I'd rather spare him all this. "To desire", from Latin "desirat": to regret something's absence. The best definition is Leibniz's: "The anxiety man feels within "by the absence of something pleasurable when present "is what we call desire. "A willful striving towards a goal, desire is particular to mankind." I'll read a passage about desire from Plato's Symposium. He says: "If man sows seeds with woman, "they breed and the race continues. "But should man come to man, "they will find mutual satiety in their relation." Satiety. Mutual satisfaction. You're really heavy-handed. It's the curriculum. Okay then. Let's continue. The difference between desire and need. Need is part of nature. It is necessary, vital. Desire... is not of natural origin. Artificial. Incidental. Superfluous. Feel dizzy? I'm fine. I swear it's worth it. Before I saw the city from here, from above. See your house? There. Four blocks after the steeple. See? I see it. That way down is easier. I can't live here anymore. You're leaving? Far? I'd prefer. But don't tell Damien. Why not tell him? I'm afraid he'll be sad over you. Don't mix wine with your meds. I've chosen to drink. Boozehound mom beats depressed mom. Whatever you say. I'm sick of being the patient. Doctor is more fun. You'll start working? You really feel up to it? I'm scared, but we'll see. I'm exhausted. We went hiking today. Not eating? I'm falling asleep. Good sign. It means I don't need pills. So long, Tom. Why didn't you eat? You have to leave. If she can work, you have no need to stay. Why are you staring? I'm in love with you. Hear me? You may feel shame, but I refuse to. You pity me! What a pain. You talk too much. You couldn't even see I was scared. How did you get here? By bus and by foot, like you. - Didn't get lost? - No, as you can see. - I needed to see you. - Not too close. Hello, Damien. - Coffee? - No, we'll fix the fence. Coffee afterwards. Come help me. I said to come. Give me the pliers. Pull the wire. Why did you leave? Your mom doesn't need me. That's not what I meant. What did you mean? Last night. Pull the wire. Just a one-shot thing. You regret it? No, I don't. So you did it to console me. It didn't work. It made me sad. That proves it's not a good thing. It is a good thing. Let go. Not here. Let's do some more. Glad you came. We fixed the fence. I'm not too good at it. But I'm learning. Not many mountain farms left. Big business lobbies gobble us all up. How is Marianne? Tom said she's working again. You'll bring her cherries? And how are you doing? You mean the baby? All's well. Hard to believe but for once it seems fine. I'm not used to so much rest. You're always welcome. Drive him back in the van. I already helped you. I need to study. - I'll drive you back. - Don't bother. I'll go back by foot, like I came. I should have given these for the evening news. Isn't he handsome? But they wanted him in uniform. Careful. It's all sorted. This was before the army. He had long hair then. - They could have saved him. - Enough. - Dead from a thigh wound? - The artery was hit. What crap! I don't buy it. Letting him bleed was misconduct. You should sue! No, Damien, it's a war. You get it? He was at war. It was his job. You're playing the hero card. Warrior pride. He risked his life. Too bad for us. You're exhausting me. I've had it! Expecting someone? Why are you here? Are you okay? What's wrong? What is it? She's giving birth. They left at 3. - Why aren't you there? - Because... She won't make it. Of course she will. It will all be fine. She almost carried to term. There's no risk now. I'll get dressed and we'll go. Don't leave me either. Of course not. See? Everything went well. Come in. - Hold your sister. - I can't. Sure you can. Come here. Take her. Come here. Stand there. Come, my little angel. He went all quiet. I'll leave your family. It's all thanks to you. It really is. Hello... - Your eyes are red. - I cried. I keep crying these days. I'm proud you're sensitive. Yeah, right. I mean it. This is in Lyon. I'd take over the practice. You want to leave? Tom will come visit when he wants to. He won't want to. You're lacking in confidence. In what? Confidence in yourself, in others, in life.
