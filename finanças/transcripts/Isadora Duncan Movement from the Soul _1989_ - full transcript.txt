(playful orchestra music) - [Voiceover] If people ask me when I began to dance, I reply, in my mother's womb. I was born on May 26, 1877 in San Francisco, California. And from the moment I entered the world, I moved my arms and legs in such a fury that my mother cried, "The child is a maniac." My father was a poet and an artist in his own right. He also caused the downfall of the San Francisco Pioneer Bank and the bankruptcy of many hard working people. My relatives called him the demon who ruined my mother's life. Reeling from the scandals, my mother divorced my father She left with my two brothers, my sister and me to face a life of poverty and single motherhood. Mother also renounced her Catholic upbringing, became an Atheist and decided that all sentimentality was nonsense. She taught us that there is no Santa Claus, nor any God, but only our own spirits to guide us. The dominant note of my childhood was the constant spirit of revolt against the narrowness of the society in which we lived. That spirit has stayed with me all my life. It is the spirit of freedom, spontaneity, revolution, niche. It is the spirit of my dance. (cheerful orchestra music) From the first, I have only danced my life. As a child I danced the spontaneous joy of growing things. My mother allowed me to leave the prison of school at age 10, and from then on I was free to wander alone by the sea and follow my own fantasies. Although I was free from regular school, mother put me in another sort of classroom. The old fashioned American Ballet was merely stiff and commonplace gymnastics. When the teacher told me to stand on my toes, I asked him why. And when he replied, "Because it is beautiful." I said that it was ugly and against nature. I left his class, never to return. Instead I began to study nature. One might ask, how can a dancer learn from nature. When the dance consists of hundreds of steps and all the rules and teachings of the balletnastics. And I would reply, "The dance does not consist of all that, "the dance is the movement of the human body "in harmony with the movement of the earth." As the musician uses his violin to tell of the highest thought, the singer, the voice, I would use that greatest of all instruments - the human body. And its language would be movement. - To me she was an instinctive genius of movement and she first invented, then she had to find the law to justify her invention which were right. It's a bit the story of the apple that fell on the head of Newton, or the glass of Archimedes. They found something in an ordinal way of living and suddenly they made a tremendous scientific law with it. - Turn out, one, two, three... - [Voiceover] I spent long days and nights in the studio seeking the central spring of all movement. That dance which might be the divine expression of the human spirit. The ballet school teaches pupils that this spring is found in the center of the back, at the base of the spine. But from this axis arms, legs and trunk move mechanically like a puppet. - Well I have an old friend, and he was for 30 years a teacher at the Conservatory of Dijon. And last time I saw him was in May last, and he said, "Madeleine, we classical dancer, "we all like that saying here we are, "here we are in the world. "Why with Isadora you always say, I'm dancing, "will you come and dance with me?" - [Voiceover] I finally found the central spring reflecting the spirit's vision. The solar plexus. Here dwells the seat of the spirit. When I dance, I am aware of a glowing light beneath my breasts. The center of all inspiration, power and magic. Here, just in the area of the heart. When I had learned to concentrate all my force on this one center, I found that thereafter when I listened to music, the rays and vibrations streamed to this one font of light within me. Under the influence of books I had read, I planned to leave San Francisco and go abroad with some great theatrical company. Carrying my little white great tunic, I danced for one theater manager after another. It's very lovely they said, but not for the theater. Disappointed but not convinced, I made other plans for leaving. My mother and I arrived in Chicago with $25 and my grandmother's old fashioned jewelry. I expected that I would have an engagement at once, but this was not the case. - [Voiceover] Do something with some pep in it. Skirts and frills and kicks, then I'd engage you. (vaudeville music) The inevitable happened. The weeks went by, our money was exhausted and we could not pay our board. One day we found ourselves on the street without a penny. In desperation I appealed to the manager of the Masonic Temple Roof Garden. Skirts and frills and kicks! We were saved from starvation, but the whole thing disgusted me. I'd had enough of trying to amuse the public with something which was against my ideals. I read that Augustin Daly was in town with his company, and decided that I must see this great man who was known as the most art loving and aesthetic theater manager in America. I told him that his theater lacked what made the old Greek theater great, the art of the dance. - [Voiceover] That's quite enough. I don't have time for your big ideas. I am however sending out a company of Midsummer Night's Dream. Report for rehearsals in New York. If you like, you might dance in the fairy scene. - [Voiceover] On opening night I found myself at last alone on a great stage, with a great public before me. And I danced so well that the public broke into spontaneous applause. I expected to find Mr. Daly delighted, but instead he shouted, "This is the theater, not a music hall." And from then on whenever I danced the fairy scene they would turn out the lights and all anybody could see was a white fluttering thing. I gave in my resignation. The whole family was now in New York. We managed to take a studio in Carnegie Hall and taught society dancing. Mazurkas and polkas to meet our expenses. Our success led to engagements in their New York drawing rooms. I was even invited by Mrs. Astor to dance in her villa at Newport. Rows and rows of Vanderbilts, Belmonts, Astors and Fishes. They all thought my dancing was charming, but hadn't the slightest understanding of what I was doing. - [Voiceover] The first striking feature about Miss Duncan is the meagerness of her apparel. - [Voiceover] Whenever her feet stepped apart one of her legs came forward and was on transitory view, full length and skin colored. - [Voiceover] Her arms are quite bare. Her garment so low and gruesome. - [Voiceover] I seek freedom of the mind through freedom of the body. Women step out of the prison of your corsets and into a freeflowing tunic like mine. - [Voiceover] Such writhings and painful leaps and hops; it really was embarrassing. - [Voicevoer] Yes, yes, I must confess, but to see her once is enough. - [Voiceover] If this was all the response America had to make, it was useless to knock upon a door so closely shut. I dreamed of London and the writers and painters one might meet there. It was my brother Raymond who had the bright idea of crossing the ocean by cattle boat. Under the assumed name, Maggie O'Gorman, I made the two week journey along with my mother, brother, sister and a couple hundred struggling beasts from the midwest. We were crazy with enthusiasm at the beauty of London. We found a small studio, bought some cot beds and hired a piano. But we spent most of our time in the British museum. Raymond made sketches of all the Greek vases and I tried to express them, humming music that seemed to be in harmony with the rhythms of the feet and the Dionysian set of the head. The Greeks understood that every movement possesses the power to give birth to another movement. A movement that mounts, that spreads, that ends with the promise of rebirth. If my movements were called gesture seen in Greek art, it is only because they both are taken from the great natural source. Despite my persistence, the London theater managers were as unresponsive as those in America. I had begun to think my dancing was not for the general public. Until one day a Hungarian impersario came to me and said, "When you wish "to find a future, seek me in Budapest." Ah, Budapest. The city was covered with posters announcing my performance. And for 30 nights I danced to a sold out house. In Hungary, I found myself for the first time in the company of absolutely carefree and sensual people. Gypsies, their music, their songs, their dance, springing from the soil of Hungary. This was the first call to the awakening of my youthful senses. (applause) - [Voiceover] This is a new art. A harmony of movements. - [Voiceover] Every other dancer will now strike me as clumsy and forced. She is irresistible. - [Voiceover] Miss Duncan is deservedly quite the rage. - [Voiceover] Her season has been most successful from both the artistic and the financial point of view. - [Voiceover] Her performances command the same prices as those of Sarah Bernhardt. - [Voiceover] Miss Duncan equals the grace of Pavlova. - [Voiceover] The holy, the divine Isadora. - [Voiceover] From Hungary my manager arranged tours through Germany, Italy and finally Russia. How strange it must've been to the St. Petersburg Ballet Society, to watch a young girl in a tunic dance to the music of Chopin. I had become use to receiving only coldness and emnity from the Ballet. But in Russia, the great ballet masters, Diaghilev and Fokine, welcomed me. It was from this time that the Russian Ballet began to annex the music of Chopin and wear Greek costumes. Some ballet dancers even going so far as to take off their shoes and stockings. My first visit to Russia was cut short by engagements in Paris. France was glorious. My brother and I use to get up at five in the morning such was our excitement and begin the day by dancing in the gardens of the Luxembourg. We walked for miles all over Paris and spent hours in the museums. It was at this time that I came across one of my greatest inspirations, The Rodin Pavilion. I stood in awe before the art of the great master. I felt that I was in a new world. I found my way to his studio. My pilgrimage resembled that of Psyche seeking the god Pan in his grotto. I believe there is nothing ugly in art except that which is without character, that which offers no inner or outer truth. People have the wrong idea of beauty. To the majority it means something suave, softly pretty. To the artist, it has a sterner meaning. In the contractions of a sickly countenance, in the minds of a vicious face, in all deformity, in all decay, there is an inner truth. (dramatic choir singing) If I'd only envisioned the dance as a solo, my way would have been quite simple. But alas, I was possessed by the idea of a school. A vast ensemble. To bring up young girls in such an atmosphere of beauty that they would become perfect in form and gestrure. In 1904, I founded a school in Berlin. Free to the children of working people. Children who would consecrate themselves to the dance. There was poverty in Europe. So when I put out a call for students to come and live in my school, flocks of parents and their offspring answered the announcement. I selected 20 girls and began to work out a series of 500 exercises. Which would take them from the simplest movements to the most complex. A regular compendium of the dance. From this school came my six most talented students who stayed with me through most of my career, and were dubbed The Isadorables by the press. I created choreographies for them and hoped that they would carry on my ideas, for they received my original training and technique. My concepts of the torso moving, of art and dance and musicality. - One and two and three and four. When you do the one and set, you usually leave the arms low - And there's almost as if there's a thread from this hand through my hand, to yours and back down again. - Some people said we should look like this-- - No, no, no, no - A tease, a little play. - Should we do it? - Sure, and.... - [Voiceover] As a rule I never notice the audience when I'm dancing. They always seem like some great god representing humanity. But one evening when I was performing in Berlin, I became aware of the personality sitting in the front row. Gordon Craig, the brilliant designer who inspired the whole trend of the modern theater. Ours was the meeting of twin souls. Had I met him a few months sooner, there would have been no school. I found in him such completion. My mother called him the vile seducer. I soon discovered that I was pregnant When the committee of prominent women supporting the Gruenwald School learned of my child by Craig, and our decision not to marry, they said that they, members of the good bourgeois society could no longer be patronesses of a school where the leader had such loose morals. These women so roused my indignation that I gave a special lecture on the dance as an art of liberation, and ended with a talk on the right of a woman to love and bear children as she pleased. My life has known but two motives, love and art. Often love destroyed art, and often the call of art put a tragic end to love. These two have known no accord, but constant battle. Gordon Craig appreciated my art as no one else had ever appreciated it. But his jealously of my career would not allow him to admit that any woman could really be an artist. "My work, my work!", he would say. And I would answer, "Yes, your work. "You are a genius, but there is my school." And his fists would come down on the table. I realized that our separation was inevitable. One day in joke I said to my sister, if the school is to continue, I must find a millionaire. Once voiced, this wish obsessed me and I repeated it a hundred times a day. Until one morning my maid came to me with a visiting card. - [Voiceover] I admire your art, your courage, the ideal of your school. I've come to help you. What can I do? - [Voiceover] He was radiant, kind, charming and devoted to the children at my school. My feelings of gratitude toward him was soon to deepen to something much stronger. Surely, after all, I'm very happy, perhaps the happiest woman in the world. My art, success, fortune, love. But above all, my beautiful children. (relaxing classical music) - [Voiceover] A pathetic tragedy which has cast a gloom over all of Paris took place this afternoon, when the son and daughter of Isadora Duncan were hurled to their deaths in the river Seine. Both of Duncan's beautiful children were drowned with their Scottish governess when their automobile crashed through a bridge railing. The bereaved mother is receiving messages of sympathy from every quarter. - [Voiceover] When real sorrow is encountered, it is for the stricken, no objection, no expression. - [Voiceover] Isadora, there is much to do. - [Voiceover] Isadora, you must return to your art. It is your only salvation. - [Voiceover] I beseech you in the name of your art... return. - [Voiceover] My friends have helped me to realize what alone could comfort me. All men are my brothers. All women my sisters and all children on earth, my children. - [Voiceover] Now, let us create your school as you wish it. And some beauty on this sad earth for others. - [Voiceover] Singer bought the great hotel at Bellevue, with its terrace overlooking all Paris. And rooms for a thousand children. There were 50 new aspirants chosen. Pupils of the first schools and the governesses. In three months they had made such progress that they were the wonder and admiration of all artists. I believed that this school would be permanent, and that I should spend there all the years of my life. (dramatic orchestra music) Even the artists said what is art, the boys are giving their lives, what is art? If I had any sense at that time, I should have said, "Art is greater "than life and remained in my studio." But I went with the rest of the world and said, take all these beds, take this house that was made for art, and make a hospital. At that moment we were all flame and fire. - [Voiceover] Miss Duncan thoroughly awakens American patriotism. She drives them mad. The recruiting stations are full of her converts. - [Voiceover] Alone, my school destroyed, and the war appearing to go on interminably, I use to sit at the dark window at night and watch the air raids. Singer and I went our separate ways. This man, who had declared that he loved me for my courage and generosity, became alarmed when he found he'd taken a revolutionary aboard his yacht. The past seemed but a series of catastrophes. The future a certain calamity. And my school, the hallucination emanating from the brain of a lunatic. When I was 21 I offered my school to Germany. The Kaiseren responded that it was immoral. Then I proposed my school to America, the rich people of America are criminally unintelligent. I went to Greece, but the Greeks were too busy fighting the Turks. Today, I propose my school to France, but France, in the person of the amiable Minister of Fine Arts gives me a smile. I cannot nourish children on a smile. And so I went to Russia. (happy orchestra music) The terrible famine came on and the government could not give me enough food. All but 20 of my students were sent home. Life in Russia is very hard. But out of the universal suffering is growing common understanding. I want to dance for the masses, for the working people who need my art. Sergei Yesenin. In Russia he is called the greatest poet since Pushkin. He is a genius. - [Voiceover] Dance revolutionary, Isadora Duncan married soviet poet Sergei Yesenin, a man half her age who speaks no English. - [Voiceover] I was forced to do matrimony. I married my husband to get him past the customs officers. For I was off to tour America and raise money for my school. - [Voiceover] Isadora Duncan detained at pier as Red suspect. Dancer held at Elllis Island Department of Justice. Suspicion of anarchistic tendencies. - [Voiceover] They seemed to think that a year's residence in Moscow has made me a blood-thirsty criminal. - [Voiceover] Duncan released from detention. Will perform at Carnegie Hall. - [Voiceover] Dancer ends performance with speech. Says her idea of communism is everybody singing and dancing together. - [Voiceover] I am a Red. It is the color of life and vigor. You people are all gray. - [Voiceover] Boston Mayor bars Duncan from stage. Scanty costume arouses widespread criticism. - [Voiceover] I would rather dance completely nude then strut in half-clothed suggestiveness, as many women do today on the streets of America. My manager tells me that if I make more speeches the tour is dead. Very well. The tour is dead! - [Voiceover] Isadora Duncan is no longer an American citizen due to her marriage to Soviet poet Sergei Yesenin, and her anti-American views. - [Voiceover] I see only the ideal, but no ideals have every been fully successful on this earth. - [Voiceover] Paris may oust Isadora. Duncan-Yesenin rampages hotel. Husband sent back to Moscow. - [Voiceover] Ideals always bring calamities in their wake. - [Voiceover] England refuses Duncan visa. A woman stranded without a country. - [Voiceover] Isadora divorces young Russian poet husband. - [Voiceover] You follow an ideal, devote your life to it and you may go mad. - [Voiceover] Duncan broke. Swindled in European tour, stranded by Soviets. Will publish memoirs and love letters to stay afloat. - [Voiceover] Yet what else is there? Nothing except ideals. Oh, she is coming the dancer of the future. She will be one whose body and soul grow so harmoniously together that the natural language of the soul will have become the movement of the body. She will not belong to a nation, but to all humanity. She will be the free spirit who will inhabit the body of new woman, more glorious than any woman that has yet been. More beautiful than all women of past centuries. The highest intelligence and the freest body. (mournful classical music)
