IF A DECADE COUNTS AS "AN ERA," THIS STORY TOOK PLACE THERE TWO ERAS AGO. CHILDREN IN THIS HAMLET ATTEND A LOCAL SCHOOLHOUSE FOR THE FIRST FOUR YEARS. FOR THE FIFTH YEAR AND ABOVE, THEY MUST WALK THREE MILES TO THE MAIN SCHOOL. The hammer rings out without pause APRIL 4, 1 928 Sparks fly and boiling water splashes The wind from the bellows blows without end The village blacksmith is hard at work He's known by all as a stubborn old fellow Early to bed, early to rise, and never sick a single day He's proud of his arm, stronger than iron Though his spirit is strongest of all His labors earn him great rewards and he's far from poor The blacksmith is famous and his business is thriving Teacher! Are you leaving now? I said farewell to the cape. Now I'll say farewell to you. I just said my good-byes at the boarding house. You're moving on to the main school now. Study hard! What's the new teacher like? She's very nice. - A country bumpkin? - Not at aIl. She's a fine teacher. But she's just a beginner? Every teacher was a beginner once. You plan to make her cry like you did me? You'd better not. My daughter will be in her class. - What's her name? - Miss Oishi. "Big Stone"? Then she's very tall. Names don't always fit. Mine means "Little Grove," yet I'm quite tall. Miss "Big Stone" is shorter than me - only up to my shoulder. Then she's a pebble. Miss Pebble! But she won't cry like I did. I told her, "You might see children on their way to the main school. If they tease you, just pretend they're monkeys. And if they're mean, pretend they're squawking birds." Monkeys and birds, get flying! You're late for school. Ding-a-ling! Ding-a-ling man! Good-bye! Be well! Be a good wife! Good morning. - She looks tough! - A woman riding a bike! Good morning. She's tough! A "modern girl"! Good morning. A woman in Western clothes! Must be the new teacher. On a shiny new bike! Good morning. A woman in Western clothes just went by on a bike! Must be the new teacher. Looks like a man's jacket! What's the world coming to? Riding a bicycle and wearing a suit! A real tomboy! Stop pushing! Stop it! It's pretty! Haven't you ever seen a bicycle before? Who wants a ride? My house is over by that smokestack. It's 50 minutes by bike, though it looks so close. Yes, it's fine weather. Not too hot, not too cold. And it's barely April. I think I'll go have a look. What am I going to do? What's wrong? That new teacher's got a teaching license and degree and everything. Not like the bumpkins we usually get around here. Is she smart? Seems to be. You didn't expect her to ride in on a bike. Why send such a classy teacher here all of a sudden? What's the principal thinking? It's the opening ceremony. My speech has to be good. - Keep your head high. - Okay. Better wear shoes today. You're right. I better look Western today. Everybody line up! You hear me? Attention! You're all starting first grade, right? Let's line up. Come over here. Are they all here? One, two, three, four... Are there 1 2? Yes, all 1 2 present. Let's line up here. Come on. Everyone over here, quick. I'll be your teacher starting today. Make a straight line. Good. Look straight ahead. Where are you looking? Look at me. Arms out in front. That's it. When I call your name, answer in a loud voice. I want to learn all your names right away. Isokichi Okada? Is Isokichi Okada not here? He is. Answer "here" when I call your name. Isokichi Okada? Sonki, answer! Everybody calls you Sonki? All right then. Sonki Isokichi? Next... Takeichi Takeshita? That's a nice clear answer. Next... Kichiji Tokuda? - Kit-chin! - Here! So you go by Kit-chin? K-l-T-C-H-l-N Tadashi Morioka? Tanko! Only answer if I call your name. Tadashi Morioka? So you're called Tanko? Nita Aizawa? You're a little busybody, aren't you? And no need to shout. What's your nickname? Nikuta. Nikuta? Does that mean you're a bully? It's not nice to tease others. Matsue Kawamoto? What do they call you? Mat-chan. Misako Nishiguchi? Do they call you Misa-chan? Mi-san. Mi-san? That's a cute name. Masuno Kagawa? Yeah. "Yeah" sounds odd. Say "here," Masuno. She's Ma-chan. Fujiko Kinoshita? Your family used to be village heads, right? Sanae Yamaishi? Kotoe Katagiri? Kotsuru Kabe? Your father's the delivery man, isn't he? The ding-a-ling man! That's why people call you a bully! Good-bye. Big stone, little pebble! Good-bye. Big stone, little pebble! She wrote down all their nicknames. She said Mi-san was a cute name. Playing favorites already! They probably gave her a present! She asked Fujiko if her family used to be village heads, like it was some big deal. Village heads? They're nearly broke! Class, where does the emperor live? Nikuta. The emperor lives in the closet. Why do you say that? Isn't he hiding in the school closet? That's not the emperor. That's just his picture. This little school doesn't have a proper place for his picture, so we fixed up the closet to keep it in there. It doesn't mean the emperor himself is in there. The train chugs along puffing white smoke Choo choo choo choo choo choo Through the tunnel across the railway bridge The train chugs along The train chugs along puffing white smoke Through the tunnel across the railway bridge Mother Crow, why do you cry? Because I left My seven precious babies Back on the mountain They're precious, so precious It opened, it opened What has opened? The lotus flower has opened And the minute it opened It closed again Before I even knew it It closed, it closed What closed? The lotus flower has closed And the minute it closed It opened before I even knew it I hope the rain stops tomorrow. Your school is so far away. Today I asked the other teacher why people there aren't more friendly. He laughed and said my suit and bicycle are too flashy and make people uneasy. It's discouraging. Don't let it get you down. People will always talk. Am I to walk there in a kimono? It's ten miles round-trip. A bike's not exactly a luxury. That's what I said! I told him I bought it on installments because I couldn't walk all that way. And you still haven't paid it off. The other teacher saves every penny he can. A woman buying on credit... he must think it's an outrage. So do the villagers, I'm sure. People say he volunteered to teach out there so he wouldn't spend money on socializing. I made my suit myself out of your old kimono. Yet they keep calling me a "modern girl." There's nothing you can do. They'll understand someday. They say it's hard for young female teachers to start out there. And older men who never made principal are sent there as their last assignment. They'll send you to the main school in a year. The school year's a third over, and it'll soon be vacation. Don't lose your spirit. Patience, patience. Takeichi Takeshita? Kichiji Tokuda? Tadashi Morioka? Nita Aizawa? Matsue Kawamoto? Misako Nishiguchi? The day I began teaching was also the first day of school for those 1 2 kids. They looked so small and anxious. Those 24 eyes looking up at me were so adorable. I don't want those adorable eyes to ever lose their sparkle. You know, Mother, none of those children has time to play after school. Most have to care for younger siblings or help with farming or fishing. It's a poor village. So I shouldn't let a little rain get me down. Now you're talking! I'll carry on, no matter what anyone says. That's the spirit. Well, that's enough for today. The banker's wife always wants everything in a hurry, but this kimono won't make her daughter any prettier. She's too fat and too plain. Mother, the rain stopped. Really? That's good. And the stars are coming out. SEPTEMBER 1 Is it always like this after a storm? You all help pick up the stones? Teacher! How's Nita? The walls of his house fell in. He was in his closet, soaked. We could see inside. He sat in the closet looking up at the sky. In the closet? He was trying to take the emperor's place. Young lady! What's so funny? Other people's misfortune? My father-in-law fell off the roof. I suppose that's funny too! I'm sorry. Then why laugh when others suffer? Making the kids clear the path! Well, not near my house! You just want it cleared for your bike! Well, you can do it yourself! A teacher cackling at others' misfortune! I set her straight! Let's stop now. It seems I got carried away. Let's go to the seashore. Little crab whisks up Some shaving foam Old man crab clicks his nippers proudly Snip, snip, snippety snip In comes Rabbit He's a customer "A haircut, please, and make it quick" Snip, snip, snippety snip Rabbit's in a hurry Teacher! We found a rare seashell. Come look! - What kind? - Come look. What did you find? It's all right. Go get the other teacher. Tell him I broke my leg and can't walk. Miss Pebble is hurt! Somebody come with us! Someone come help! I don't think it's broken, but she needs a doctor or masseur. Take her to Dr. Soka in Nakamachi. It'd be quicker by boat. Not in this weather. Do do do re mi mi mi so so so la so That doesn't sound right. I only went to grammar school. I never learned to play the harmonium. With Miss Oishi out, it's more work for you. Oh, she's got it worse. You're right. It's more painful to tear a tendon than play a harmonium. She may not come back to school. Her mother's furious about the whole thing. She says her daughter is irreplaceable and she won't send her to this miserable village again. I don't blame her. But Miss Oishi's out for now, so we need a substitute. I'm tired of teaching sewing in her place. I have no time to make money on side work. Enough talk. I'd better practice. I've got to learn this. You're right. Miss Oishi teaches them corny old folk songs. It's like an Obon festival. If you learn to play well, the students will respect you. The crags of Senbiki... Do do do re mi mi mi so so so la so Let's all sing together, okay? Why aren't you singing? I've done all I can. You won't learn if you don't try. Everybody on your feet. Stand up. Here we go. You're impossible. Sing whatever you want, and I'll listen. Ready? One, two, three, go. Teacher, what should we sing? Anything. I know! "Chirp, Chirp, Plover." I know that one. Ready? Chirp, chirp, plover On nights when the plover sings Even with the window closed It's still so cold I hate that music class. I like Miss Pebble's songs better. When's she coming back? I wish I could see her face. She's in the hospital. She was, but she's out now. Maybe she'll be back soon. I hope so. She can't even stand up yet. Let's all go visit her. Yeah, let's go to her village. She said her house is near that smokestack. Nita, how long does it take to get there? It's not far. The bus hardly had time to honk and we were there. I didn't even have time to eat a bun. Liar! That only takes a minute. Even a fast bus can't get there in a minute! I started eating it at the shrine and still had it in my hand when I got off. - You telling the truth? - Yes. - Then hook pinkies. - All right. I want to go see Miss Pebble. - Let's go! - Yes, let's! We'll run all the way there and back. Let's sneak away after lunch. Don't tell your folks or they won't let you go. We'll sneak out. - We'll meet by the grove. - Good idea! Let's go! Kotoe, aren't you going home to eat? I can't sneak out with Grandma there. I'll skip lunch. I'll bring you some beans. Wait at the grove. Miss Pebble will be surprised. You think her leg still hurts? See, the Achilles tendon is here. This big muscle got torn. - Big kids! - What do we do? Hide! Keep quiet! Why are you hiding down there? Hello. Have you seen our Kotoe? - No, I haven't. I don't see my Sanae anywhere either. - Nice weather, isn't it? - Yes. Have you seen Sanae around? I haven't seen our Matsue either. - I can't believe Fujiko's gone too. - Where would she go? Our children are gone. Is Takeichi around? How strange for all of them to disappear. Is Kit-chin around? He was here for lunch. Where did they go? SUIGETSU INN The first-graders are all gone! Then Masuno's probably gone too. Did you see a group of 7- and 8-year-olds go by? No. I saw them outside the stationery store. Maybe they went to a puppet show. Without money? Maybe they're gaping at the posters. What will that little fool say when she gets home? Should we scold them? We can't exactly praise them! Here, wear this. You sure you just ate one bun? I don't know. It was my first time on a bus. So you lied? No, but I was watching the scenery, not eating. So you just held it in your hand? Kotoe, we have to keep walking. I'm hungry. Come on. Mother Crow, why do you cry? Because I left My seven precious babies Back on the mountain They're precious, so precious Mother Crow sings It's Miss Pebble! Miss Pebble! What's going on? We wanted to see you. We didn't tell anyone we were coming. Well, you'd better all get on the bus. Go on! I made a lot, so eat all you want. - I want more. - Eat what you have first. It's good my doctor's visit ended early or I'd have missed you. That's right. Seconds! Me too! Here we go. Look at the flower. Here we go. Ready? Look at the flower! Steady now. All done. Good-bye! Good-bye, Teacher! Hisako, is your head off in the clouds? Thank the principal. Has it been decided who'll take my place? Yes, we decided at our staff meeting. Is something wrong? No, I'm just... in a bit of a fix. What kind of fix? I promised the children I'd return to school. Now that's a surprise! Can you get there by yourself? Your mother says you can't ride your bicycle. Hisako, the principal has been very kind. If you transfer her to the main school, in just 1 0 days she can start taking the bus. Your help would be greatly appreciated. Your replacement is to be Mrs. Goto. We planned to ask her to retire next year, but she could work three more years at that school, so she was very happy to accept. Things worked out quite well. Isn't that nice? She's like her father... a bit stubborn. Yes, like him in all the worst ways! The principal was a friend of your father's. That's why he's being so accommodating. Pardon me. What's all this? Thanks for treating the children the other day. It was nothing. I was very happy to have visitors. Their parents sent along a few things: A quart of rice, two quarts of beans, These are dried sardines. Two more quarts of rice and a quart of beans. It's Miss Pebble! Miss Pebble's coming! Miss Pebble! Does your leg still hurt? Can you ride your bike yet? It may be another six months. So you'll come by boat? So you'll walk all the way? Let's go to the school. Teacher! How's your leg? We've been worried. Thank you. I'm very grateful for the rice you sent. I want to thank you for the lovely beans. I sent sesame. Ah, thank you for the wonderful sesame. Thank you for the lovely card. Actually, I meant to send something, but I was too late. Please forgive me! Thank you for the wonderful presents. Oh, it was nothing. Forgive my bad habit of always meddling. Not at all. You know... I can't ride my bicycle for quite a while, and the school is so far away. Limping along on my crutches, it would be night before I got here. That's why I can't... If you take the boat, we'll come meet you every day. Really? And see me off every evening? Yes. Right? Thank you. I wish I'd known that sooner. I'm afraid it's too late. I've been transferred to the main school. I'll be waiting for you there when you're older. I just came to say farewell. Another teacher will be coming soon. Study hard. I love this little village, but with my leg like this, it's impossible. Teacher, we're sorry! It's all right. All children play pranks. It was just my bad luck. What's this? She came all this way just to see you. You should be laughing instead of bawling. Are you better now, Miss Oishi? Yes, thank you. There's no figuring out women and children. If you want to cry, go ahead! Cry all you want! So much for teaching my lesson! Teacher! Come back to see us! Come back when your leg gets better! You promised! Good-bye, Teacher! Let's send her off with a song. This time let's sing "The Crags of Senbiki." One, two, three... Mother Crow, why do you cry? Because I left My seven precious babies Back on the mountain They're precious, so precious Mother Crow sings Go take a look In my old nest on the mountain... THE COLOR OF THE SEA AND THE SILHOUETTE OF THE MOUNTAINS REMAINED THE SAME AS DAY FOLLOWED UPON DAY. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS... THE MANCHURIAN AND SHANGHAI INCIDENTS TOOK PLACE, AND THE WORLD SUFFERED THROUGH THE GREAT DEPRESSION. UNAWARE OF WHAT LAY IN STORE... THE CHILDREN PASSED THEIR DAYS CAUGHT UP IN THEIR OWN JOYS AND SORROWS. LAND OF THE RISING SUN Night falls in autumn Upon our encampment covered in frost A flock of crying geese Passes overhead Moonlight once shone Upon our planted swords That moonlight of olden days Where is it now? Above the castle ruins The moon rises at midnight Its light remains unchanged For whom does it shine now? Nothing along the fence But the creeping vine No sound from the pines But the howling wind The lights in the heavens Are forever constant But the fates of those on earth Forever rise and fall Will you choose to shine upon us Even to this very day? High above the castle ruins O midnight moon! There's the principal! Good morning, sir! Why are you all here? To greet Miss Oishi's fiancé. How did you know? From Kotsuru's father, right? He's an engineer on a tourist ship. Everybody knows that. We want to see his mug. If you stare at him like that, he'll crack! Is Miss Oishi coming? She's getting prettied up at home. Ooh, isn't that nice? Miss Oishi is very pretty. Let's follow them! I'd be too embarrassed. I'll get yelled at if I don't get home. Why? This is a special day. It was hard enough getting out to join you. Yes, go home and help your parents. School starts in five days. - That's why we have to have fun now. Is that any way for sixth-graders to talk? You're practically grown-ups! Get to work! The boat's coming! He's so fat. No, her fiancé's behind that man. He's all right. Matsue! What do you want? Stop playing around. Your mother's having the baby. - Really? - Hurry home. You can't walk all the way back. Matsue, pack your father's lunch box tight, but leave room in your own. It's too big. Mother, I'd like a new one with a lily on it. When will you get me one? - When I can get up. That same day? Wait a minute. Who's going to pay for it? Wait until your father earns some money. - I'll buy you one. - You will? Just be patient. I wish you'd stay home today. I don't feel so good. Matsue can stay. Times are too tough to take a day off. See you later. Hurry or you'll be late for school. - You don't need me here? - No, don't stay home. It's your first day in sixth grade. But come home right after school. Don't mention the lunch box again in front of your father. He's having trouble finding work. But Ma-chan and Mi-chan have lily lunch boxes. You promised to buy me one this year. I'm ashamed of this old one. Teacher! - What is it? - My mother had a baby girl. Congratulations! What's her name? Nothing yet. I'm going to choose it. - Have you thought of one? - Not yet. I see. What would be a nice name? You seem happy. What is it? Mother's going to get me a new aluminum lunch box with a lily on the lid. That's nice. A lily, eh? Wait! That's a good name for the baby. Lily... Yuri. Name her that. Yuriko... or Yurie. I prefer Yurie. Yuriko is so common these days. - You smell nice. - What? Just like a bride. - What's going on? - They're rushing someone to the hospital. Maybe appendicitis? Mat-chan, what's the matter? You're very kind, but unless the baby dies, I can't let Matsue go to school. I know it's hard on her... but now that I'm a widower, I don't know what else to do. Mat-chan, this lunch box has a lily on the lid. Use it when you come back to school. Help your father here at home. I'll be thinking of you at school. You're such an admirable girl. She kept asking for that lunch box. Thank you. In any case, the baby was premature. Without her mother's breast, she hasn't much chance of surviving. She'll be better off that way. In a home as poor as this... what happiness could she hope for? Teacher! Mat-chan's baby sister died. My grandma went to offer condolences, and Matsue's dad was drunk. He kept crying, "It's better this way." The poor baby. Good morning, Teacher. Good morning. What is it? They arrested Mr. Kataoka. The police are still here. - What did he do? - They say he's a Red. Mr. Kataoka a Red? How could that be? He'll be released soon for lack of evidence. It's most unpleasant. - How did this happen? - A teacher friend of his in Onomichi was filling his own students' heads with antiwar ideas. He and his pupils printed an anthology, Seeds of Grass. The police thought Kataoka had a copy. I've seen that pamphlet. It didn't seem Red to me. Say that and they'll think you're a Red too! What on earth for? I thought it was well-written. I read some of the stories to my class. "Barley Harvest" and "Soy Merchant's Chimney" were good. That's dangerous material! Where did you get it? - A copy was sent here. - Where is it now? - In my classroom. - For heaven's sake! Quick, show me where it is! That was a scare. We teachers have to be patriotic. What a fright you gave me! I think it took years off my life. SEEDS OF GRASS ONOMICHI MIDDLE SCHOOL, CLASS 3 "Dear Matsue, I was so sad to hear about your baby sister, but these things happen in life. Never stop loving her in your heart. Please try to feel better. When will you come back to school? I look at your empty desk every day and think of you." Now... who gets a newspaper at home? And who reads it? Just three of you? Who knows what a Red is? No one, of course. How about a capitalist? It's a rich person. That'll do for now. And what's a worker? Your late father was my friend. That's why I'm worried. Can you imagine your mother's grief if you got into trouble? The students know all about Seeds of Grass and Mr. Kataoka. They asked why he was arrested. Then you simply say you don't know. You have to be careful what you say these days. Proletariat, capitalists... you don't discuss such things with your students! I'll be more careful. Please do that. Being too outspoken can only hurt you. Teacher. It's about Mat-chan. Did you give her my letter? I took it to her house. A strange woman was there. She took Matsue to Osaka on the night ferry. She's being adopted by relatives. Matsue cried and said she wouldn't go and held on to the beams of the house. Her father was calm and gentle at first, but then he started slapping and punching her. Nobody could stop him. Finally she agreed to go. Everybody was crying. I cried too as I went to see her off, but Mat-chan didn't say a word. Konpira comes from the shadows Kirakirara! AUTUMN... OCTOBER He flashes his golden staff And clears the fog from the mountains and seas Once again now! Konpira comes from the shadows Of the mountain's fresh leaves Kirakirara! This shrine belongs to Konpira Guardian deity of seafarers Rarararara! Keeps you safe in stormy weather Lights the way with his lantern Until you drop anchor Once again now! This shrine belongs to Konpira Guardian deity of seafarers Rarararara! I wish Fujiko and Sanae could have come. Mi-san too, though she's an only child. That's why she couldn't come? - She might catch a cold. - She said that? She'll get two times what the trip would have cost. Mi-san told me herself. There are other ways to get money. But getting to see Konpira is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I'm using my money from fishing. I sold eggs, and Sonki and I raided our bank accounts, right? My folks said I had to use my own savings. Your parents are stingy. My dad bought me this uniform. What's wrong with your shoes? Can you walk in those? I wear size 1 0, but my dad says my feet grow fast. What size are those? Eleven. Fujiko's family is deep in debt so she couldn't come. Their big house is about to be repossessed. They've got nothing left to sell. You shouldn't talk about such things. You want to be a midwife, don't you? A good midwife doesn't gossip. Let's sing some more. Let Ma-chan sing. Masuno, you're the best singer in school. - Sing "Moon over the Castle Ruins." - I like "Song of the Beach." Walking along the beach In the morning light I'm reminded Of things from times past The sound of the wind The shapes of the clouds The tide coming in The colors of the shells Wandering the beach In the evening light I'm reminded Of people from times past The tide coming in The tide going out There's the tourist boat! Oishi, don't fall overboard. Leave me alone! There's her husband's ship! Teacher, wave! Aren't you going to wave? There he is. I know that mug. Hey, Mr. Pebble! Yashima Bay and its pale waters are a reminder of young Minamoto archer Nasu no Yoichi. Some 760 years ago, in this tranquil cove, the brief glory of the Taira clan disappeared like a springtime dream. Here the final battle between the two clans took place. White sails cross the sea of green islands, and cool water laps at the shore. Yashima Bay is blessed with lovely scenery and legends that are now beautiful poetry. REMAINS OF YASHIMA CASTLE Ritsurin Park, in Takamatsu City, occupies 1 85 acres at the foot of Mt. Shiunzan. It's one of Japan's most famous parks, along with Kairakuen, Kenroku, and Korakuen. Mrs. Oishi, do you feel ill? No, I'm fine. You are now at one of Shikoku's main attractions, Mount Zozu. Rising 1 ,700 feet above sea level, it's the site of the Konpira Shrine. It's 785 steps from the base to the main shrine, and another 583 steps to the inner shrine. Deity of seafarers, protector of safety and prosperity, Konpira has many fervent devotees. Mrs. Oishi, you look pale. I'm tired and feel chilled. - Did you take any medicine? - Yes, seasickness pills. But some hot udon would be nice. I'll go with you. We have time. I'll let the other teacher know. Udon in broth is good for a cold. Let's try over there. One tempura. Mat-chan! Welcome! So you weren't in Osaka? You've been here the whole time? May I ask who you are? I can't have her going outside. This was my teacher. She was very kind to me. I'm Mrs. Oishi, from Shodoshima. Well, well! So kind of you to come. Please come in. Get them some tea. Please join me, Mrs. Tamura. Thank you. I've been wondering what happened to you. But I'm glad you seem well. This is Matsue, a former pupil. You seem to be working hard. Yes, she's a big help. There's so much to do in a restaurant. Matsue, the donburi is ready. Are you ladies sightseeing here? Yes, on a school excursion. Isn't that something! You must be tired. It can't be easy running all over with so many children. How about a bite to eat? What should we do? - Do you have noodles? - I'm afraid we don't. Welcome. We have all kinds of donburi. There's not much time, so we wanted something light. I see. Well, at least enjoy your tea. Thank you. Two crab donburi. Are you catching the next ferry? It'll be leaving soon. - Shall we go? - Aren't you going to talk to her? She's quite busy. Matsue, don't just stand there. Come say good-bye. Your teacher's leaving. Sorry to have inconvenienced you. Please forgive our poor hospitality. Mat-chan... take care. Write to me, and I'll write too. Good-bye. Take care of yourselves. Teacher! Teacher, where did you go? HOPES FOR THE FUTURE MATSUE KAWAMOTO Since I'm an only child, my mother wants to send me to a prefectural high school. But even just looking at numbers makes my head hurt. I want to go to sewing school, where there are no exams. From now on... if women don't have jobs, they'll have a hard life like my mother. That's why my older sister is working as a nurse at the Red Cross. I want my sister to send me to a teacher's college so that I can become... A TEACHER Fuji-chan, why aren't you writing anything? What's wrong? What is it, Fuji-chan? Can't you tell us? Come with me. I have no hopes for the future. What can I write? You don't have to write then. I know how hard things have been. I really wanted to go on the school trip. I don't even know how much longer we can stay in our house. It's someone else's now. It's all right. Don't say anymore. I don't know what to say, but these hardships aren't your fault, or your parents' fault either. These things happen for a lot of reasons. So don't lose heart. Just keep your spirits up. Maybe I'm asking the impossible. I don't know what else to say. But if you ever feel like crying, come to my house. We'll have a good cry together. So you're really dropping out? But you like school, don't you? Why not stay at least another year? You're a good student. I'd hate to see you go. Shall I speak to your family? It's too late. I already promised. Promised what? To whom? I promised my mother I'd quit school if I could go on the school trip. That's too bad. So there's nothing I can do? My sister will be starting fifth grade. If I stay in school, who'll cook at home? It's my turn to fix the meals. Your sister cooked until now? Your mother goes out to fish every day? Almost every day. That's why you wrote one day you wished you were a boy for your mother's sake. Yes, I feel sorry for her. But Kotoe, it's not your fault you were born a girl. In any case, it's a shame. But at least when my sister finishes sixth grade, I'll get to work for a dressmaker. And when I'm 1 8, I'll be a maid in Osaka. I'll spend all my money on clothes, like my mother did. And then you'll get married? Yes, you'll get married... just like your mother. I'm going to middle school. After I graduate, I'll fish until I'm drafted. Teacher, I can become a sergeant major, right? - You want to be an NCO? - They get a monthly salary. I'll go to college and become a second lieutenant. Stop bragging. I'd go to middle school if there weren't entrance exams. Why do you want to become soldiers? I won't inherit anything. It beats being a poor fisherman. I'll inherit the rice shop, but I'd rather be a soldier. Really? You'd better think it over. Are you against soldiers? No, but I prefer fishermen and rice merchants. So you're a coward. That's right. I'm a coward. Mother, I brought the teacher. She won't listen to a thing I say. I know she has a good voice, but lots of girls in Japan have good voices. The shamisen is more fitting for a restaurant owner's daughter. What good are school songs here? She insists on attending a conservatory in Tokyo, so she wants to go to high school. Her father's absolutely furious. Please talk some sense into her. She sulks all day and won't eat a thing. Masuno, listen to what your teacher says. Don't be so mule-headed. Tell her if she goes to the conservatory, she'll be no help to her family at all. It's not my place to interfere. I understand you and your husband's position, but I know how Masuno feels too. No! She's talking nonsense, grasping at rainbows! I've known Masuno since she was just a little girl in first grade. She was so adorable. Masuno... your happiness means everything to me. I feel so bad that I can't say more now. But you know, all the boys want to become soldiers. I'm worried sick about losing even a single one. I'm happy I don't have to worry about that with you girls. I want you to grow up happy and healthy. I'd like to help you realize your ambitions, but there's nothing else I can say for now. There's really nothing more I can say. What is it? Mrs. Oishi. Please sit down. People are saying you're a Red! You must be more careful! I'm afraid I don't understand. What do people say I did? I warned you about this before. There are things a teacher must not discuss with her pupils. I can't think what I might have said. I didn't tell them anything that was wrong. That's where the danger lies. You're young. You blurt out everything that enters your head. You can't do that these days! Watch your words or you'll get in trouble! Watch what words? Ever since Japan established Manchukuo, there's been tension on the Soviet border. We have air-raid drills even on this island! The whole country is banging the war drums, while you keep saying it's silly to become a soldier! I just don't want my students killed. It won't do! But I just... Just don't say anything. See nothing, hear nothing, say nothing! Our sole duty as teachers is to raise citizens to serve the nation. We look up to our teachers So grateful for their kindness The years on the playground Have passed so quickly We look back On those precious days But now we must part And say good-bye The friendship and kindness Shown every day Will stay with us The rest of our lives We'll fend for ourselves Work hard and make our names But now we must part And say good-bye We'll never forget The school's familiar windows The glow of the fireflies The snow so deep and white We'll never forget the years We have spent here But now we must part And say good-bye Mother? You're awake? - Where's Mother? - She went shopping. How do you feel? Better. A little sleep did the trick. That school excursion wore you out. No, it's the baby. Don't worry. Just pop it out. Easy for a man to say. - Hurry up and have it. - Don't be silly. It'll make coming home that much more fun. I'm sure our baby will be adorable. But your work's probably made you sick of kids. Want some tea? - No, thanks. The truth is... I'm fed up with teaching. School starts in two days. Maybe I should resign. Why? I'd like to quit and start a candy shop. I've done my best for my students for six years, but we're not allowed to establish any real bonds. The only thing tying us together is the state-approved textbook. What hypocrisy! "Loyalty" and "patriotism" from dawn till dusk! My boys all want to become soldiers. It's awful! It's the times. Can you stop the war by running a candy shop? I should've listened to my mother. "Never marry a seaman." You begged me to marry you! What will happen if war breaks out? Our lives will be cut short. You'll be drafted onto a ship that could be sunk at any time. I could be widowed with a baby on the way. Say, if I'm quitting, why don't you quit too? We could be farmers. No, thanks, but you quit if you like. I will. I'm going to tell Mother. Aren't you being a bit impulsive? No! Well, your mother's too old for surprises. She needs glasses to do her sewing jobs. You get to listen to the putter of your ship. But I'm serious. I've had enough of teaching. - Hisako! - She's back. Some students are here. Really? Welcome! Pardon my appearance. I was sleeping. I'm so glad you came. Good day. Come inside. We have to catch the next bus in 1 5 minutes. Really? Catch the one after that. Then we won't get back until dark. I see. Wait and I'll walk you to the stop. Isokichi, what's that hunting cap for? I'm not going on to high school. You're really quitting? Thanks for all you've done. Take care. Wait. I'm coming with you. What will you do now? I leave tomorrow for an apprenticeship in Osaka. My employer will send me to night school. It's all decided? What kind of work? - A pawnshop. - You'll be a pawnbroker? No, just a clerk. I'll work until I'm drafted. Well, be a good clerk, and write to me. Takeichi, when does school start? In two days. Hisako! Are you really quitting teaching? - Yes. I'll tell you about it later. You're quitting teaching? That's right. It won't be any fun without you two there. Wait here. I'll go change. Come inside. Be sure to visit on your holidays. I want to see you all grown up. You were my first students, and my last. Now we'll be good friends. You too, Takeichi. Fujiko and her family moved to Hyogo yesterday. Yesterday? Five people and their stuff in ding-a-ling man's boat. All they had were futons and pots. Her parents never did any heavy labor. Everybody's afraid they'll become beggars. I see. How awful. I feel so bad for Fujiko. Thank you for everything. Take care of yourself. Be well. Good-bye, and take care. Attacking injustice in heaven's name In loyalty and bravery our soldiers have no peer Let's send them off with a cheer Now they leave their parents' land "We won't return alive unless we've won!" They vow with courage in their hearts They'll crawl through the grass They'll dive into the sea... THE COLOR OF THE SEA AND THE SILHOUETTE OF THE MOUNTAINS REMAINED THE SAME AS DAY FOLLOWED UPON DAY. BUT THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF SHODOSHIMA WERE CARRIED ALONG ON THE VAST WAVES OF HISTORY: THE WAR WITH CHINA, AND THE ANTl-COMINTERN PACT WITH GERMANY. To what can we compare Our army engineers' meritorious deeds? We'll support our engineers, with hoes in their hands We'll support our infantry, with rifles in theirs Our army's shells Will silence the enemy EIGHT YEARS LATER Heaven and earth resound with their booms The enemy's resolve will falter In the face of our volleys We will dance to the top of their forts Despite their barbed wire... Hello? Kotoe, it's me. No, don't get up. I wanted to visit sooner, but the baby keeps me so busy. Thank you for coming. Are you home alone? Everybody's out fishing. I'm always alone during the day. I'm really glad you came. I wanted to see you. Me too. I always want to see you. All I do is look at that picture. Ah, that picture. I often take it out too. You were all so young. I hadn't eaten when we set out. I got so hungry on the way. I was the first to cry. You were all crying when I ran into you. It makes me laugh to think about it. The noodles you gave us were so good. I still remember the taste. Now all of you are grown. I heard that Misako found a husband and had a wonderful wedding. That's right. She's lucky to be an only child. And Sanae's now a teacher at the main school. She graduated with honors from a teacher's college. I ran into Kotsuru in Osaka. She's an honors graduate in midwifery. That's right. She writes to me sometimes. I'm the worst off of all. Teacher, I don't... have long to live. What are you saying? You have to keep your spirits up. Teacher, I've suffered so much. I know. You've been through a lot. Do you remember what we talked about during recess that day in the sixth grade? I certainly do. I wanted to grow up and pay my mother back for all her kindness. I was happy to go to Osaka and become a maid. Yes, I remember. You were the brightest girl in the class, so I hoped you'd go on to high school. But you went to work for your family's sake. Teacher... I worked so hard that I got sick and had to come home. My parents won't even come near me. I'm left alone all the time because I have tuberculosis. But you know... you're not the only one who's suffered. I saw Mat-chan eight years ago on our school trip. She had a hard life as a waitress. Fujiko's family went bankrupt. Kotsuru's been writing to me. She's now working in a café in Kobe. I can't imagine her life is easy either. You'd think Masuno would be happy at her parents' restaurant, but she runs away to sing and always gets dragged back. There aren't many happy people around. So don't think you're alone. Try to cheer up. I'll come visit as often as I can. It's nothing, but I brought these for you. Thank you. Our soldiers leave home Bravely vowing to return victorious They won't die before achieving great deeds KICHIJI TOKUDA On hearing the bugle's call They see a sea of flags before their eyes NITA AIZAWA They spend the night in camp With their bullets, tanks and bayonets TAKEICHI TAKESHITA In their dreams their fathers tell them "Don't come back alive!" TADASHI MORIOKA With calm eyes they stare at enemy skies With smiling faces they think ISOKICHI OKADA "May today's battle drench me in red." They will never forget their comrades Who died laughing "Long live the emperor!" Were the last words on their lips Ah, those faces Those voices My wife and child Urging me on to great deeds Flags were waved so hard That they tore in pieces Now they flutter again in the distance Far off in the clouds The duty of a soldier Is to die For the sake Of his emperor The cap of my comrade Who laughed as he died... Soldiers all in a row marching with their guns March, march, march I'll heat up some sake. Handsome soldiers I want to be a soldier Mother, you think it's something to celebrate? There you go again. He only got furlough because he's sick. They'll send him off again. Stop arguing. Mother, I'd like some sake. It's war. There's nothing we can do. What's wrong with those kids? Daikichi, be quiet in there! Are they too dense to see I'm upset? They're just kids having fun. Come to Daddy. Don't start crying. That won't help. I want you to grow up big and strong to take care of your mother and grandmother. I'm leaving for the war. Come on, let's sing a song. Soldiers all in a row Marching with their guns March, march, march FOUR MORE YEARS PASSED, AND THE WAR IN ASIA SPREAD. THE NUMBER OF PLAIN WHITE GRAVE MARKERS GREW. They fly again today through the inlet's misty skies The vast cloud of our hopes Has finally taken shape Navy student pilot You do not fear death Your wings Are the wings of victory Break through Across the turbulent seas And strike the enemy's fleet I wish I was in middle school. That way I could enlist. Are you that eager to die? After all I went through bringing you up, you want me to cry the rest of my life? You'd be the mother of a hero honored at Yasukuni. What's so special about that? Being your mother is enough for me. You know, Daikichi, I just want you to be a normal human being, an ordinary person who values life. No one else talks like that. They may not say it, but that's how they feel. My teacher doesn't talk like that. That's why I quit teaching. - Coward! - Coward! Fine by me. I don't need people's praise. I just love the three of you. Hisako. Mother, can't you sleep? Are you in pain? You'll feel better soon. I'll make some nice rice porridge tomorrow. What's wrong? Are the blankets too heavy? Mother, what's wrong? Daikichi, come here! Go get the doctor. Tell him to hurry. Mother, you'll be all right. Tell him to come quickly! At ease! Oishi, your mother's here. Mother, what is it? Daikichi, your father's dead. I just got the notice. I ran right over. We must be strong, Daikichi. You understand? COUNTY ASSEMBLY HALL VICTORY AT WAR! AUGUST 1 5, 1 945 Attention! Present arms! Order arms! We've called you here on short notice to hear the voice of His Gracious Majesty the Emperor broadcast on the radio as he addresses the entire nation. Listen attentively and with reverence. Present arms! Daikichi, don't be so glum. Now children can go to school like children again. Let's eat. Mother, we lost the war. Didn't you hear on the radio? I did... but it's good that the war is over. Nobody else will be killed in action. The survivors will return. We couldn't die for our country. Thank goodness for that. Are you glad? Stop talking nonsense. Are you? Your father was killed. He won't be coming back. Aren't you going to cry because we lost? I cried all right. I cried for the dead. Please help! Somebody, please! Doctor! She fell out of a tree! Please help! Yatsu! Daikichi... Mrs. Oishi! Doctor! You were so small, and so hungry. No wonder you climbed that persimmon tree. You had to. You were starving. You didn't do anything wrong. Poor thing... still clutching that unripe persimmon. A YEAR AFTER THE WAR'S END APRIL 4 SCHOOL RESUMES It's finally clearing up. Is it your first time to the cape? Yes, I never had any reason to come. Of course not. I never thought I'd be teaching in that schoolhouse again. It's been 1 8 years. Almost two decades. I can row you in the rain, but not if it's windy. Don't worry. If there's a storm, I'll walk. That'll tire you out. Don't be silly. I've still got some life in me. I have to raise you and Namiki to be fine young men. You could use a bike. We can't afford one. They're so expensive. Are you tired? I'm all right. You're good at rowing. Another child of the sea. Anyone can row. There was a child named Takeichi Takeshita. He was just a first-grader then, but he offered to row me home. That was long ago. He was killed in the war. - A pupil of yours? - Yes. When I call your name, answer "here" in a loud voice. Satoru Kawasaki. Katsuhiko Yamamoto. What spirit! You all answer nice and clearly. Makoto Katagiri. Are you Kotoe's little sister? Kotoe died, didn't she? Chisato Kawamoto. Are you related to Matsue? My mother's in Osaka. She sent me this uniform. So you're Matsue's daughter? Katsuko Nishiguchi. Is your mother's name Misako Nishiguchi? You look just like she did at your age. Hiroshi Shono. In the fields of rape blossoms The setting sun grows dim A thick mist frames The distant mountains A spring breeze blows And you gaze up at the sky The evening moon rises Amid the faint aroma of blossoms The fires in the village The color of the woods People walking the paths through the fields TADASHI MORIOKA FALLEN IN BATTLE The croaking of the frogs The tolling of the bell All grows hazy on this misty moonlit night Mrs. Oishi! Misako! My daughter said you went home this way. It's so good to see you. I wanted to see you again. What a coincidence that my daughter will be in your class. Please take care of her. It'll be my pleasure. When I heard you were back on the cape, I cried for joy. Two generations. It's such a rare thing. I owe it to Sanae. She's teaching at the main school. I thought I was too old, but she recommended me. Sanae, Kotsuru, Masuno and I talked it over. We want to have a party for you at Masuno's. You're all very kind. Thank you. No, we're all very happy to do it. Seeing all of you again... how wonderful that will be! Tadashi wanted so badly to be a soldier. I suppose he died happy. Look over here. TAKEICHI TAKESHITA FALLEN IN BATTLE He preferred being a soldier to running a rice store. Now he's ended up here. Nita's grave is here too. NITA AIZAWA FALLEN IN BATTLE He was so big and loud, but not a mean bone in his body. On our school trip, his uniform was too big, and so were his shoes. Mrs. Crybaby! Mrs. Crybaby! You've already got another nickname. It was Miss Pebble before. Now it's Mrs. Crybaby. Mrs. Crybaby! The bus would be quicker. Are you tired already? You're such a weakling. I'm not tired at all! I don't mind walking. Isn't that best? You're having a picnic today, so we'll walk. The bus costs money. And it wouldn't be a picnic. Mother, we'll play on the temple grounds, but what if your party lasts a long time? You can play on the beach below the inn. What if the village kids tease us? Then tease them back. What if they're stronger? Then bawl your head off. They'll laugh at us. I'll laugh at you too. If I hear you crying, I'll clap my hands and laugh. Will you see the beach from the restaurant? I imagine so. Will you check on us once in a while? All right. I'll look out and wave. Go on now. Don't leave your lunch boxes behind. See you later, Mother. Mother, what if it rains? Silly! You'll just have to think of something! Teacher! We have a surprise guest. Can you guess? A surprise guest? We'll put our faith in you if you guess right. Oh no, the moment of truth has come. A surprise, you say? Could it be two people? Fujiko and Matsue? So close! - Am I right? - You have to choose one. Then Matsue. It is Matsue! She came from Osaka. Did she really? I haven't seen her since the school trip. Teacher! We've been expecting you. Welcome. Thank you. I'm so glad to see you well. Kotsuru, you're so plump! Just like a midwife! Watch what you say. Teacher, I'm Matsue. I'm so glad... you could make it, Mat-chan. I really am. When Misako wrote, I knew I could never face you all again if I didn't come, so I swallowed my pride and rushed here. Teacher, forgive me! Let's go. Teacher! I could hardly wait. Please come in. Thank you for hosting this party today. - What about Sonki and Kit-chin? - They haven't come yet. It's a gift from all of us for coming back to teach at our school. Let's sit down and relax. Today we get good and drunk. Sonki's here. Sonki's blind now. It must be hard. It was kind of him to come. He made it back alive, but it's tough. He's studying to be a masseur. He lives at the tofu merchant's. He's said a few times he'd rather be dead. Poor boy. That means he didn't see any way to go on. - You kept us waiting. - Sorry I'm late. Sonki, it's been so long. Teacher! Yes, it's been a while. Five years. That's right. And look what a sorry state I'm in. Enough of that. This is a cheerful occasion. Sonki, you'll sit next to Mrs. Oishi. Only Kit-chin isn't here yet. - Who wants soda? - I'll have sake. - So will I. - Just a minute. Maybe I will too. Sonki, would you like some sake? Just one cup, in your honor. Thank you all for the bicycle. It was so thoughtful. Don't thank me. I couldn't give much. That doesn't matter. Thanks to you all, I can ride to school now. You're all here? You're late! What a huge fish! Teacher, it's been so long! Yes, it certainly has. Kit-chin, don't leave the fish there. I caught it especially for Mrs. Oishi. That's why I'm late. It's huge! I'll have them prepare it. Thank you. Thank you for going to all this trouble. Mother Crow, why do you cry? Because I left My seven precious babies Back on the mountain They're precious, so precious Mother Crow sings May I see the picture? That's right. We didn't show it to Sonki. It's as if you can see it. Yes, I can see it perfectly. Teacher is here in the middle. Takeichi, Nita and I are in front. Ma-chan is to the right, and Fujiko's over here. Mat-chan is clasping her hands with her pinky sticking out. Walking along the beach In the morning light I'm reminded Of things from times past The sound of the wind The shapes of the clouds The tide coming in The colors of the shells Wandering the beach In the evening light I'm reminded Of people from times past The tide coming in The tide going out The color of the moon The light of the stars We look up to our teachers So grateful for their kindness The years on the playground Have passed so quickly We look back On those precious days But now we must part and say good-bye THE END
