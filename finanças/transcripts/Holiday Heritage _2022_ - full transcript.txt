Can you believe it's here, our favourite time of year? Smiles are bright like diamonds all around Ooh-ooh... 'Cause there's no gift like the present Why not live in the moment? Shake off our yesterdays Come on and shake, shake, shake, shake And let's celebrate good times Make a memory tonight Why don't we dance for the Yuletide Come on, everyone, let's celebrate good times Ah, Ella, there you are. This is my mom. Mom, this is the graphic designer I told you about, Ella Chapel. She's a rock star here at Graphics. Oh, stop! Ms. Willis, it's so nice to meet you. Rodney talks about you all the time. Oh, well, he raves about you. Oh! Always so nice to see a strong young woman running things. Oh, well, I don't exactly run things. I just work here. She'll be running things soon. Ella's planning on opening her own shop. Shh! Rodney! I haven't told the boss yet. Well, good for you. So, do you have family here in Boston? No. No, I don't. Alright, everyone. It's such a thrill to have all your families here at our Christmas party this year. After all, none of us would be where we are without them, am I right? It's been a great year at Graphics. Please, go and enjoy your time with your loved ones. I'll see you back here... next year! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Family is the bedrock of our existence. It's the reason we do what we do. It's the reason we are who we are. The best interest of our family should be at the heart of our decisions. Now, I know we Chapels don't always get along, but as long as I'm around, we're gonna stick together. When I'm gone, someone's gonna have to pick up the mantel. Ella, that's gonna be you. Okay, Grandpa! - Hey, Mom. - Hey, Ella! One more day till my baby comes home! Ugh, I am so ready! It feels like it's taking forever for Christmas to come this year. Oh, I know, honey. How are things in Boston? Good. I got the building. Ella! You signed a lease? No. Well, why not? I don't know. Just... maybe it just seems so real now, starting my own business and planting roots in Boston. I know, sweety, but you've been talking about it for months. Exactly, and I don't want to talk about it right now. I just want to come home and spend Christmas with my family. You know, last year, when your grandpa passed, no one was really in a celebratory mood. And, uh, I'm afraid this year is not gonna be much better. Don't tell me you and Grandma had it out again. Ugh, that is an understatement! Oh. Well, you know what Grandpa always used to say, "Family has to stick together." Right? Ella? I'm moving to Chicago. What?! Your grandma and I, we never saw eye to eye. But I don't know, it's like it's getting worse. I guess your grandpa was the glue that held us together. What does Grandma say about you leaving? She doesn't know. I'm gonna tell her tonight. No, no! Not a word until I get there, okay, Mom? Please? I'll see you tomorrow. My baby! Oh, I missed you! How are you? Gosh, you look fantastic! Oh, stop! Let's go surprise them. Oh, you betcha! Okay, let's get started on these holiday brownies! We already have 12 dozen of them already. Let's do something different: white chocolate peppermint éclairs! The residents of the nursing home love my brownies. Besides, I don't think they'd take too kindly to your fancy éclairs. Really, Mom? Really! Merry Christmas! - Oh! - Oh, Ella! - Hi, Grandma. - Oh my goodness! - Hi, sweety. - Hi, Mama. Ooh! Well, look at you. Boston agrees with you. Tess, Micah? Brad placed a last-minute order for the Christmas party at the fire station: four poundcakes and a fruitcake. He does this every year. Yeah, but there's not enough time. I can whip up some pastries. I came up with this really cool recipe. - Hmm! - Oh, no need. I knew he was gonna do this so I baked everything last night. Doreen, let's box them up. I've got this, Micah. Coffee? Sure. Well, despite everything, honey, it's good to see you. So, Mom, what is going on? You and Grandma were barely looking at each other. It's been like this for the past year. Why didn't you tell me? Honey, you have your own life going on in Boston. I don't want to burden you with family drama. It's my family drama. You and Grandma are my family. I could have helped. I doubt anybody could have helped. Grandpa did. Oh, well, that's for sure. But, you know, with him gone, I can really see the cracks in our relationship. Okay, but do you really think leaving is the way to fix it? I'm not sure. But this is something that I have to do, Ella. And I was hoping you'd be a little more happy for me pursuing my goals. I'm happy for you. No, I am, Mom, of course. I... I want this for you. More than anything. But I just... I want to make sure that you're doing it for the right reason. I am. And I don't want you to leave things with Grandma unsettled. I mean, wouldn't it be nice if you two were in a good place when you leave? It would be nice, but it's not gonna happen. You know what Grandpa always used to say: "Never go to bed angry." And you know what I say? Never leave town angry. So, what are you gonna do when you leave Mary's Town, anyway? Oh, take a page out of your book. Maybe get my own spot. I've always wanted a cute little bistro, French pastries, small plates. You could do that at the bakery, you know. Your grandmother is not open to my ideas. "Tradition," or so she says. Well, I mean, I get that. Her recipes were handed down from her grandma. Yeah, and I'm not trying to change that. It's just that I have been helping her run the family business since I graduated from college. I know I had you when I was young, but I'm not getting any younger. I'm in my fifties, Ella. It's time. But do you really think that this is gonna make you happy? Leaving Grandma and the bakery and Mary's Town? You did. You want to go by the fire station and drop off the cakes with me? Do I have a choice? Nope! What? What? Stop cutting your eyes at me and say what's on your mind. Why don't you lighten up on Micah? Lighten up on Micah? And lighten up on yourself while you're at it. I don't know what you're talking about! You work and work and work all the time. That's all you do! Work and go home. Well, what else am I supposed to do? Where else am I supposed to go? Well, you used to go out with me, with your friends, with Micah. I'm too busy. Too busy to talk to your daughter? I talk to my daughter all the time! Hmph! Listen, I know you miss Riley. We all do. And I know this time of year is hard, but Riley wouldn't want you cooped up in this bakery all day and all night. He'd want you to celebrate. You have your daughter, you have Ella, you have me, and you have your friends. Don't we count? Of course you count. What kind of question is that? Well, I'm just saying, at some point you gotta get back in the game. I can't celebrate without him. I don't know how to. Girl, yes you do. You can do this. Come here. You know I love you. I love you, too. Now, let's get back to work. - Okay. - Okay. Oh! All the deliveries have been made. Oh, thank you, sweety. A little birdy told me that you don't have your tree up yet. Oh, I've been too busy. Well, no worries. Mom went home to change and then she's gonna pick us up and take us to the tree farm. You will have a tree before the night is over. I guess you're the boss. Well, if I'm the boss, then why don't you let me design you a new logo? What's wrong with the one I have? Oh, well, nothing. It just, you know, could use a little updating. Do I take you and your mother for granted, Ella? Because I don't want you to think that you don't count, because you both do. I just... Oh, well. What? Oh, nothing. Let's go get the tree. See anything you like, Grandma? Oh, they all look so beautiful. You need one, too, Mom? She's got a fake one. They're pretty, and less mess. What?! There's nothing like the smell of a real tree. Yeah, Mom, I like it too. I'm gonna go check out these trees. - Hey, family! - Griffin! Mayor Knoxville! Good to see you guys. Griffin. Hey, Ella. Hey. Merry Christmas! So, I didn't... I didn't know you were in town. I just got here today. Okay, cool. Cool. How are things in Boston? Good? They're good, yeah. Things are good! Good. Uh, how are things here? They're good, they're good. They're good. All good. Uh, we're just getting Grandma a tree. This late? Don't you be scolding me too, now! Okay! - Well, it's good to... - Okay, yeah... Um, I should get going. But I'll see all of you later at the tree lighting ceremony. Yeah! Yeah. Alright. Excuse me. That'll get easier. Maybe. Alright, ladies, this tree is not gonna decorate itself. I'll go get Grandpa's albums. Which ones do you want? Uh, Nat King Cole, Sinatra. Mm-hm? Jackson 5... Just bring 'em all. Okay! Let's go get the ornaments. Oh... Grandpa Riley's Kwanzaa chest. Man, that thing was always filled to the brim. Mm-hm! - Come on. - Yeah. Last night was fun, right? Hm. At least you two didn't argue. For once! I'm glad you had a good time, though. Seeing all the ornaments and listening to Christmas albums, it all just felt right. Oh, but we didn't put up Grandpa's lights - outside, though! - Oh, man! That would have been the first thing he did. The day after Thanksgiving! That man could do Christmas 365 days a year. That and Kwanzaa. Mm-hm. Seeing that chest last night, it brought back so many memories. "Kwanzaa is cultural medicine for Black families." Mm-hm. He was so dramatic. Every night, lighting those candles, talking about the seven principles. Yeah, he believed in those principles. Mm-hm. He embodied them. He was an awesome man. He was. It feels really good to talk about him for a change. Mom doesn't mention him. Not around me, anyway. Hey, I was thinking... What if you took a few months? You know, hang out somewhere and see how you like it first before moving away altogether. Like you said, you need a break. No, I need a change. But putting down roots somewhere else? Yeah, that's the plan. I mean, of course I'll come back and visit, but the plan is that I'm moving away for good. And I'm not gonna change my mind. So, did you get your Christmas shopping done - this afternoon? - Yeah, most of it. Look, they're doing the Karamu Festival again this year. That's awesome. Well, you know Griffin. He's a lot like your grandpa. Thinks that Kwanzaa is a community cure-all. Hey, Grandma, do you remember that Kwanzaa scrapbook that Grandpa had? Is it in his Kwanzaa chest? Nope. Well, where is it? Oh, either at Griffin's house or his office. I gave it to him after your grandpa died. I knew that he would carry on those Kwanzaa traditions once he replaced your grandpa as mayor. Well, can you tell him that I need it? No, if you want it, you ask him yourself. Okay, everyone! Three, two, one... Grandpa would be pleased. Thanks. Griffin, I know I'm probably the last person, and we haven't spoken since Grandpa's funeral, and I probably have no right to ask you for anything, uh... What are you trying to say, Ella? My family's falling apart and I may only have a few days to turn things around, and I really need your help. Okay. Come on, let's talk. I can't believe your mom's leaving town. I always thought her and your grandma were model mother and daughter. Well, it was only because Grandpa was around to keep the peace. Have you seen them lately? No, I'm ashamed to say that I haven't been over there that much lately. I... I should have checked on them a lot more. No, you had your hands full, I'm sure. So did I. I mean, I had no idea how bad it had gotten. I heard you've made a lot of changes around town. Yeah, trying to make the place better, you know? No place like home. And you're still doing the Karamu Festival. - That's great. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it wasn't the same last year without your family, but some things are worth preserving, right? Right. Here, have a seat. Um... So? I was hoping to get my grandpa's Kwanzaa scrapbook back from you. Yeah. I mean, why? Well, seeing as Kwanzaa starts the day after Christmas, I was thinking that maybe getting my mom involved with some Kwanzaa celebrations might convince her to stick around, in case Christmas isn't enough to nudge her and Grandma back together. Do you think that would actually work? You don't? I know better than anyone you can't change what's in a person's heart. Besides, if her and your grandma have issues, you've just gotta talk them out. Like we did? Sorry, this isn't about us. Yeah, it never was. Right? Before I left Boston, I dug up this old video of my grandpa talking about how important it is for us to... - stick together as a family. - Yes. He said that once he was gone, it would be my responsibility. I thought nothing of it at the time, but now I realize that it's up to me to make sure that they patch things up. Even if my mom leaves town and they're physically separated, I've gotta find a way to unite their hearts again. I could really use my grandpa's guidance right about now, and I think I'll find it in that scrapbook, so if you don't mind... Yeah, sure. I'll get it for you. You got it. Come on. Look, Ella, I really hope this works out for you, because I'd hate to see another Chapel woman leave Mary's Town. I'm so happy to have my baby home, aww! I'm so happy to be home. So, what's going on with you? Why haven't you signed the building lease yet? Oh... no reason. I just want to make sure it's the right building. Hmm. You seeing anybody in Boston? No. Why not? I don't know. Hmm, Griffin? What? No! I... No. I just haven't met anybody that I want to commit to. Hmm. Can't commit to a building lease, can't commit to a relationship; I'm starting to see a little pattern here. Nope, no pattern. Oh, if you say so. I do. So... did you bring them? I did! Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley? Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years! He died seven years ago this very night. Good morning, Miss Tess. Griffin! What in the world are you doing out here? Putting up your lights. Well, I can see that, but why? Because your house is the only one on the street without any lights. And the neighbours threatened to call the police on you. They did no such thing! You know, for as long as I can remember, Mayor Chapel would be out here the day after Thanksgiving, rain or shine, putting up these lights, and I'd be right there with him. You sure would. Alright, here we go. We used to have the best talks while we untangled these lights. You know, it was like he had a way of... teaching without preaching, you know? I know. That's one of the things I loved about him. And he loved you like a son. He told me. And I'm glad I told him how much I loved him, too. Mm-hm. But I must say, I should have checked on you a lot more, Miss Tess. Stop it. No, no, no, I should have checked on you, and I should have called to see if you needed me, and I should have put these blasted lights up the day after Thanksgiving. You're the mayor, Griffin. You've got a lot of people to look after. I do, I do. But don't tell them this, but I like you a little bit more. You know, I thought coming back to his house and not seeing him here would make it so painfully real, but now that I'm here, it's a comforting reminder that he was a big part of my life. Mm-hm. So I guess... you know, whenever I miss him, all I have to do is come back here. You know, I hope you're still coming to the Karamu Festival. Well, I think Riley would want us to be there. Okay. Thank you for keeping it alive. Of course. Yeah. You know, I can help with that! No. Come on. You have better stuff to do, I'm sure. No, no, Ella's supposed to be coming to take me shopping for the recipe swap, but she's always late. We've got time! Okay. Alright, alright. - I have this. - Oh! Oh, I love it. Oh, yes. Alright, ladies. You know that the Chapel women recipes - are always the star of the swap. - Mm-hm! Except last year. I heard Marilyn Strand and her daughter... Never mind Marilyn Strand! The Chapel women are back! We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas... We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy new year Good tidings we bring to you and your kin Good tidings for Christmas and a happy new year! Micah... That's too many chocolate chips. Wow, they smell amazing! Please help yourself! French pastries... I baked them myself. Yes. Well, if it isn't Marilyn Strand. Hmm. - Hey. - Hey. Those look good. Thank you. Ah, my pleasure. This recipe has been in my family for generations. They're my original recipe: cranberry brie bites. A Mary's Town tradition! I think it's gonna take more than a scrapbook to fix that. Yeah, maybe. I guess I'm just feeling hopeful. I hear you. Well, we can meet up later tonight and I can bring you the scrapbook. Yeah. Great, thanks. What do you think, seven? Seven's perfect. Alright. Tyler's Diner? Tyler's Diner! Alright, I'll see you later. See you then. Oh, hey! Is this little cookie-nabber yours? Ella, Griffin told us you were in town. Oh, did you lose my number or what? Renee, I'm so sorry. My family has kept me super busy. I can imagine. - These are yummy! - Oh, thank you, Maisey! Yeah, still the gingerbread queen, I see. Someone's gotta do it. - Mm. - Can I go, Mama? Yes, baby, but just where I can see you, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Glad to see that two years in Boston didn't rob you of your down-home baking skills. It would take longer than two years for me to forget anything that I learned in Mary's Town! So, how's the big city? It's good! Boston used to be amazing. Now it's just... "good"? Is there something you aren't telling us? Any time. Good to see you. Check you out! Looking all mayoral. Hey, Jonah. Where's Maisey and Renee? Off enjoying your amazing event. Well, thanks, but I still have a lot of work to do. You're doing great, brother. Thank you. I appreciate that. Do you remember when we used to come to these events - and everybody knew everybody? - Mm-hm. I know half these people. - You want one? - Yeah. Thank you. Times are different. - People keep to themselves. - Yeah. Well, I miss the days when people knew your parents, and your parents' parents, you know? Now the only time people come to the square is for Christmas and Kwanzaa. I wish it could be like that all the time. You're the mayor. Make it happen. Boston was a nice change of scenery. A chance to spread my wings. Does it have the same allure that it did when I first moved there? Absolutely not. Do you regret leaving? I mean, you broke up with Griffin and all. No, I regret hurting Griffin, but Boston has taught me a lot. Any new love connections? - Renee! - Come on, spill! I've dated a couple guys, but they're not... they're not exactly... Griffin? This sudden feeling of nostalgia wouldn't have anything to do with Ella being back in town, - would it? - Come on. But you know I'm right. No, I know no such thing. Yeah, you do, because otherwise the most eligible bachelor in Mary's Town wouldn't still be eligible two years after his breakup. Uh-huh, that's what I thought! Okay, alright, - I'll give it to you. - Mm-hm! Daddy! Jonah, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. - Welcome home, Ella. - Aw, thank you. I think this little one has had way too much gingerbread today. Yeah, any more and she's gonna turn into a little gingerbread girl! So, where are you two off to next? - Um... - We're probably gonna... We're... going to Tyler's later. Yes, and talk about the, uh, Karamu Festival. Mm-hm. And other stuff. That's good. It's about time you two caught up. Aw! Good seeing you, as always, man. Yeah. I'm glad you two are gonna talk about the festival. That's all we're gonna talk about, Renee. Mm-hm? Well, see you later. Okay. Alright... Griffin, do yourself a favour and have the conversation. Okay. Hey! So, I'm going for the... "I know you hate me for breaking your heart "but I hope we can still be friends" look. That works! So, today was interesting. How did it feel to be doing your own thing? It was good. People really liked my tarts. A lot of folks took the recipe. And your gingerbread cookies were a hit. Baking is in the blood, I guess. And of course, everyone devoured Mom's Bundt cake. I didn't even get a slice. Oh, I'm sure she saved you a piece. She's always looking out for you, you know. We still talking about cake? Grandma's not a mushy person. You know that. It's hard for her to talk about how she feels, but she shows it. Oh, she's been showing it, alright! She acts tough, but she's a big old softy, just like you. You just gotta get past the tough exterior to get to the gooey centre. Hmm! But why do I have to do all the work? Maybe you guys should stop fighting about who's baking what and talk about why you're really upset with each other. Spoiler alert... It ain't brownies or Bundt cake. Hmm. Oh! Thank you. Thank you for this. You're welcome. Oh, look at all these photos! Yeah! Right? Kwanzaa candies? Yeah, your grandfather and I talked about printing candy wrappers with the seven Kwanzaa principles on them. It was his idea to hand them out at the Karamu Festival. Oh! - Pretty cool. - Yeah. The principle that was on your wrapper is the principle that you have to focus on in the upcoming year. Huh. What if we did Kwanzaa cookies? Kwanzaa cookies? Yeah, my mom and grandma could bake them and I could use icing for the Kwanzaa principles. Ah, and get them working together instead of fighting? Yes! And it would give me more time to convince my mom to stay, or at the very least smooth things out between them. Kwanzaa cookies could work, I guess. I know that they could work, I just have to convince them to go along with it. I think I know a way. Oh, hey, you are just in time! For...? I made a bûche de Noël. A Yule log cake. You gotta taste it. Oh my goodness, Mom! Right? Amazing! I know. Mmm! Has Grandma tested this? Well, you know, she doesn't sample anything I bake unless it's a "traditional" Chapel Family recipe. Mm-mm, you should bring her some. Unless you've already gone over there to get your cake? Oh, girl, you know that Bundt cake is probably long gone by now. Would you care for a slice? Is that a real question? Oh, yeah! - Oh... ooh! - Mmm! Here you go. Thank you! You know, I've been thinking about what you said about how me and Grandma need to deal with our real issues. Mm-hm, and...? And... maybe you're doing the same thing. With Griffin. I mean, you're always talking about Kwanzaa and Grandpa's scrapbook, but you're kind of ignoring the big old elephant in the room, which is why you broke up with him in the first place and left town and then never looked back. Talk about going to bed angry. Away in a manger, no crib for a bed The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head The stars in the night sky look down where He lay The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay To live with Thee there... Here you go! Thank you. - Hey, Griffin! - Hi, Griffin. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Follow my lead. Miss Tess, Miss Micah. Hey there. Whatcha looking for? Ha, your time! If you can spare it. Both of you guys, actually. Oh, what's up? So, you guys know I'm planning the Karamu Festival for Kwanzaa, right? And I'm following Mayor Chapel's plan right down to the letter. But I did want to add one thing... Kwanzaa cookies. Oh? It says "Kwanzaa candies" here. I know, I know. Candies, cookies, they're kind of the same thing. Well, except cookies are better. See, cookies are better. Hmm, looks like a lot of work. The city's gonna pay for it. Look, I know it's a lot, but we need a lot of cookies for a lot of people, come on. I don't know. I think it sounds like a great idea. You two have each other, you have Doreen, and then, of course, I'll decorate them. I'm just not sure about the timing of all this, Ella. What do you mean? We'll be done all the Christmas stuff by then. I know it's a lot to ask and it's last-minute, so it's okay if you guys can't do it. It's okay. Marilyn Strand and her daughter offered to do it, so I'll just have them do it and we can... Oh, wait. Marilyn Strand has offered to make my Riley's Kwanzaa cookies? Yeah, yeah. Well, it was Riley's recipe. If anybody's gonna do it, it's gonna be me and my family. If you want to. You two could kill this, Mom! I mean, the two of you, working side by side as one team, one mission, one goal... a thousand cookies! Oh, at least. What do you think? I think... we're gonna be making Kwanzaa cookies. Yes! Okay, let's make a list of ingredients. Alright, I'll make the order. - Oh? - That was brilliant. Thank you. You, too. I'll walk you to your truck? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh, hey, I was wondering if you might be free for dinner or something. Um, I think we need to talk. Sure. We'll make it happen. Okay. Actually, Antonio's reopened. Oh! We should go. Then I'll make reservations for us. - Great. - Seven? Oh! Uh, yeah, seven is good. Alright, so then I'll see you then. - Okay. - Alright. See you tonight. So, are you and your mom still staying at Miss Tess' for the next few nights? Mm-hm. Yeah. That's good. Yeah, it'll be nice for her to have some company during the holidays. Well, in spite of everything, of course. Well, it'll definitely be interesting. Yeah. So, Griffin, we never really talked about... Look, Ella, don't... Don't do that. What's done is done. The reason my mom is thinking of leaving is because she can't talk to my grandma. And I have a feeling that you and I broke up because we never talked about our feelings or the future or... You followed your heart. Don't regret that. I don't regret following my heart, but I do regret breaking yours. Hmm. Okay, well, since we're talking and we're... we're opening up, I have something that I need to tell you. That night that you told me that you were going to Boston, I was gonna propose to you. To... what?! Mm-hm. I had the ring, everything. Griffin, we never talked about... I know. It's because I thought we were on the same path. I don't know what to say. Well, would it have changed anything? Don't answer that. Some stuff is better left unknown. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't tell you that to make you feel bad. It's just I know that I didn't tell you how I felt back then, and then I just... I assumed you knew. Well, I have a confession to make, too. I hoped that you would come with me to Boston. You never asked me to come with you to Boston! And you never offered. I didn't! I didn't. Well, um... communication, right? It's a beautiful thing, I guess. You know, from now on, how about open and honest communication? - Agreed. - Alright. Maybe we can accomplish as friends what we could not as a couple. Exactly. Alright. Um, I want to talk to you... about something. You first. No, no, you. I was just... wondering... what you wanted to do for the Kwanzaa cookies. Oh. I was thinking maybe your shortbread recipe. I think we should go with the traditional Kwanzaa sesame cookies. Yeah, the benny cakes? Yes. Perfect. What was it that you wanted to talk to me about? Oh, uh, you and Ella are still planning on spending the next few nights at my house, right? Well, yeah, we always stay through Christmas. - Of course. - Oh, okay. Okay. Ooh! Pancakes? Girl, you know how we do! I do! So, are we opening gifts tonight? You and your grandpa always wanted to open gifts on Christmas Eve! You and Mom always wanted to wait. That's the one thing we agree on. Hmm. You okay, Grandma? I'm fine. You know, you should take a break after the holidays. Go somewhere that you've always wanted to go. I'm right where I've always wanted to be. Well, sometimes seeing new places can help. You know, get a different perspective. Make you appreciate what you have. I already appreciate what I have. Sometimes people need to hear that. People like who? Like Mom. Oh, Ella. Your mom and I have never been well. We don't speak the same language. But you love each other. Just speak to her with love, Grandma. Hey. - Hey! - What you guys up to? Grandma and I were just talking and... Ella wants to open gifts tonight, and I told her to wait until tomorrow. What do you think? Open one gift tonight and all the rest tomorrow, like we usually do. That's what I thought, too! Now, who wants some Christmas Eve pancakes? Ooh, I do. Where did you and Griffin leave things? Well, we agreed to be friends. - That's terrible! - Oh! At least he's not bitter or angry with me anymore. I just wish I had known he was planning to propose, Renee! Would you have stayed? - That's what he asked me! - And...? I don't know. Oh! I'm sorry. Ella! Hey! Merry Christmas Eve. To both of you. Hey, Griffin. Hey, Renee. Wait, where's Jonah? Oh, he's hanging out with Maisey. It gives me a chance to finish up some Christmas shopping without her little eyes scoping out everything I buy. Got you. Uh, I'm gonna go in here. The hardware store? Yeah, Jonah needs some... nails. Some nails? Nails, yeah. Doing some last-minute shopping? Yeah, you know, I got a couple things. Me, too. Okay, cool, cool. Are you coming carolling tonight? Oh, yeah, I'll be there with Christmas bells on. Okay, alright. Oh, is there any update on your mom and your grandma? Baby steps, but I do think that the ice is starting to thaw, just a little bit. Okay. Alright. Well, then... tonight? I gotta... Oh, tonight? Uh-huh. I'll see you later. Yeah, see you. See you later. Hmm, not my best work. You were only seven! No matter how many times I asked, he would just not let me replace that stocking. Good thing I chose a career in baking instead of art. Did you, Micah? Did you choose to be a baker or...? Or did I just follow your footsteps? I'm not sure. I mean, there are times where I don't know that I feel like I ever really had a choice. And if you had? I don't know, Mom. You know, is it me or... are these lights looking extra bright this year? It's definitely the lights. Mom, we're gonna be late! Let's go! Silent night, holy night All is calm, all is bright Round yon virgin, mother and child Holy infant, so tender and mild Would you look at that? Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace. Mmm! Smells good. Aw, I missed doing all this stuff last year! Carolling and shopping and hanging out with you and Grandma. Yeah, I missed it, too. You know, moments like these? They're priceless. You're not gonna get them anywhere else. Not even in Boston? Hmm, especially not in Boston. Well, not that there's anything wrong with Boston, but you're not there and Grandma's not there. Ella, I know what you're trying to do. I haven't changed my mind. Well, she's gonna think that you're leaving because you're mad at her if you don't convince her otherwise. Well, how? Whenever it's just the two of us, she comes up with every excuse possible to avoid having a real conversation with me. Hm. Unfortunately, I know what that's like. What do you mean? Let's just say that my life would probably look a lot different right now if Griffin and I had been honest with each other back then. Aw, baby. Come here. Mmm! Look, I love you, and that is not gonna change, even though I'm moving to Chicago. And don't you worry, I will still help your grandma make all those Kwanzaa cookies. Hello? Hey... yeah, I think you might be right. It's gonna take more than cookies to convince my mom to stick around. What did you have in mind? W.W.G.R.D.? I'm sorry, what? "What Would Grandpa Riley Do?" Okay, I got it. Oh... Bailey's makes everything good! Oh... I wonder who that could be? I'll get it. Grandma, you dig out a present for each of us to open. Girl. What? One gift each on Christmas Eve. That was the deal! That child of yours! I remember that. That is kind of the deal! Hey, family! Oh, hey, Griffin! Merry Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas Eve. Merry Christ... Sorry to pop in and drop by like this. - I was... - Oh, no! He was in the area. Yeah. Yeah, and you just happened to have our Christmas gifts with you? Well, I was gonna come by tomorrow, so I just... Why didn't you just bring them by tomorrow? - Uh... - Well... Because I... Oh, Griffin, just come clean. We know why you're here. You do? You came to see Ella! That's right. I came to see Ella. Yeah! Well, take his coat, Ella. Oh, right. And get him some hot chocolate! You're just in time to hear Ella read "'Twas the Night Before Christmas." Grandpa Riley used to read it to me every Christmas, which was fine before I became a teenager. But now that I'm an adult, I love it again. It just reminds me of so many wonderful Christmases with my family. Well, you better make the old man proud. I will try. Alright. "He sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle, "and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. "But I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight, "'Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!'" Thank you, Ella. Your grandpa loved to read that poem every Christmas Eve. Sitting in that very chair. He was a stickler for his traditions. Mm-hm! Yes, he was. Like going shopping for a Christmas tree. Mm-hm! Waking up at the crack of dawn Christmas morning. Celebrating Kwanzaa. And I must say, celebrating it last year was not the same without the Chapel Family. We'll be at the festival, for sure. Alright. Well, I think what Griffin means is what about all the other days of Kwanzaa? We should celebrate as a family. And friends. I don't know, Ella. I mean, I've got that thing. What thing? Oh, Mom, it's nothing. We should light the candles every night. Yeah, and cook a family feast. And talk about the seven principles. Ella... There was something about talking about those principles that really just put things into perspective. Right, Griffin? That's right. You remember all those wonderful African dishes you used to make, Grandma? Oh, they were really good, weren't they? They were amazing! I don't think we have time to make those this year. We really didn't plan for any feasts. Grandma, Mom, I've seen you two whip up 200 cookies for last-minute parties more times than I can count! I mean, we can do this. I'll pitch in. We'll all pitch in. So, it's settled? Kwanzaa celebrations, all seven days? That sounds really nice, actually. Great. Mom? Sure, Ella. Sure. There you go, my sweetheart. Thank you. Oh... Micah! Thanks, Micah. Thanks, Mom. I hope you like it. Aw. To remind you of home. It's perfect. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, open yours. Alright. Wait, it's the same exact Christmas pin that Riley used to wear during the Christmas tree lighting! Gotta look the part, right? That's right. Thank you. You're welcome. Dear heavenly father, we thank you for this time together, and for your provisions. In his name we pray. - Amen. - Amen. Dad's Kwanzaa chest! Happy Kwanzaa, baby. Habari Gani? Umoja! On this, the first day of Kwanzaa, we strive to maintain unity in our family. Now, who's ready for some ground nut stew? Mm-hm! Oh, yes. Yes! Thank you. Ooh! Stew, stew, stew! I'd like some of that. This looks so good. Thank you so much. Don't take all those greens! Give the lady her greens! Thank you. On this day, we pledge to define ourselves, name ourselves, and speak for ourselves. Grandma? "Shukura." Grateful. "Unika." To shine. "Khalfani." Destined to lead. "Taliba." Seeker of knowledge. And I would add "seeker of self." What do you think? Pretty cool, huh? I'm having a silent auction for the Karamu Festival and proceeds benefit local charities. Griffin, I love this. It's pretty good. I mean, some of these artists have worked all year to create some of these pieces, and the money helps fund art programs in our community. Hmm! See, let me show you something. Come here. Okay. Check that out. I mean... wow! I know, I know. I was thinking, wouldn't it be nice to have a set of the seven principles for the auction? What do you think... donate your talents for a worthy cause? I would absolutely love that. Alright, alright! Okay. Well, here are some art supplies. If you need anything else, just let me know. - Okay. - Alright, alright. Hey, we're up here. Have a surprise for you. Ooh, now you've piqued our interest! - Oh, wow! - Look at this! Oh, wow! - Oh, you look so precious! - Look at you! Oh, I remember this place! Renee and I used to sit here for every morning assembly. Yeah, and this was always my seat. Well, Habari Gani? Nia. So, uh... why did you bring us back to the school? Well, because today's principle is "purpose." You see, this is where we all dreamed of what we wanted to be. This is where the seeds of our purpose were planted. Now, as you guys know, I lost my parents when I was young, and this community became my family, and they lifted me and they guided me and they gave me my purpose: to strengthen and unify the community that has just given me so much. Miss Tess? I guess my purpose has always been tied to other people. My husband, my family. I never really thought about who I was apart from them. Maybe I should have. I guess. I always thought being an artist was my purpose, but it's not enough just to create. You need to know why you're creating, and for whom. You need to know what fulfils you. I've been asking myself a lot of those questions lately. Even at my age, I still struggle to carve out a space for myself, a space separate from my parents. It's always been a little scary for me, but I think I found out how. A shop of my own, in a town where nobody knows me, where I can build something, my way. Now, I don't know if... leaving Mary's Town and moving to Chicago is the answer, but... I think I'm ready to find out. You're leaving? Mom. And this is how you tell me? Mom, I was talking to Ella and we thought maybe it would be better if we just... Ella, you knew about this? I-I... Oh... Mom! Grandma! It's fine, Micah. Go find your purpose. By all means, don't let me stop you. Mom? Mom! Grandma! Grandma! Mom! I hear winters in Chicago can get pretty cold. Yeah, well, it gets kind of cold here, too, so I'll be fine. So, uh, what time do you want to head to the Karamu Festival tomorrow? And are we taking separate cars? I'm not going. Mom, look... Ella. Now, I know what you've been trying to do, and I really appreciate it, but it didn't work. Well, you didn't want it to work! You made up your mind that you were leaving and there was no talking you out of it. Oh, like what you did when you left? I'm sorry. Is that what this is about? I left, so now it's your turn? Oh, come on, Ella, you know I would never begrudge you for following your dream. Is that what you think I'm doing? I don't really know what you're doing. I'm trying to keep my family together. I didn't realize we were broken! Mom, look at you! Look at Grandma! I mean, you two can barely be in the same room together. You don't laugh together. You don't cry together. I mean, I almost wish that you two would just have one big fight and get everything out in the open and be done with it! Well, maybe you're right, or maybe we'll both say things we could never come back from. Is that what you're afraid of? Ella, despite what you may think, I don't want to lose my mom. You two... you're all I've got. So tell her how you feel! Maybe some day. But not now. Are you worried that she'll convince you to change your mind? No. Well, maybe. And I don't want to. That's a lot of dough. Why didn't you tell me? - You knew all along. - I... I knew something was up because you were trying too hard to play peacemaker. She wanted to tell you herself. Well, she sure picked a great way to do it! She thought that you'd be upset with her. I am upset with her. For crying out loud, Grandma, why can't you two just be honest with each other? Why can't you be honest with us? What's really going on here, Ella? And where do you fit into all of this? What do you mean? Something's bothering you, and somehow this whole thing between your mother and I is making it worse. I promise I will fill you in on all of the gory details of my life, but can we just go to the festival? I am not going to the festival! What, are you just gonna stay in here and bake all day? Oh no... the cookies! With everything going on, we forgot to start the cookies yesterday! Oh my goodness! We're never gonna get them done in time! We promised Griffin! I can't let him down, not again! - Please! - Oh... Before you say anything, Mom, Ella called. And you need all the help you can get. Griffin's on his way, too. One thousand cookies in less than 24 hours. Do you really think we'll get this all done in time? I've been wondering the same thing myself, to be honest. We're gonna be just fine. Okay. Did someone call for the baking brigade? Oh! Well, give us our baking orders. Strand Family Bakery here. Anything we can do to help? Welcome to the team. Matunda ya Kwanza For the first fruit of the land Matunda ya Kwanza The time for lending a hand... to each other I can't believe everyone showed up to help like that. That's what community's all about, you know? Even little Maisey made it to the bitter end. Looks like we're gonna be alright. Mom, please! It'll be alright. Hm. You know, when I was a kid and I would get into trouble, my mom would sit me down and give me a good talking to. Just me and her, in a room, talking. I think I have an idea. Before we go to lunch, I just want to stop at Grandma's. Why? There's something I need to do. I promise it won't take long. What are you doing here? I have to get to the bakery. I know. This'll be quick. What's going on? A couple of years ago, I was playing around on my new phone and I decided to interview Grandpa. Now I realize that he was sending us a message. And, um, it's... edited a bit, but just listen. Family is the bedrock of our existence. It's the reason we are who we are. The reasons we do what we do. The best interest of our family should always be at the heart of our decisions. Now, I know us Chapel family don't always get along, but as long as I'm around, we're gonna stick together. So I want my family to promise me a few things. Do and say everything with love. Remember, you're stronger together than you are apart. And never, ever go to bed angry. Apologize when you're wrong, and forgive each other and trust each other, always, in all ways. Make me proud, family. I know that you both believe that what you feel is right, but just this once, can you really talk to each other? And more importantly, really listen. No judgement. I... I don't know where to start. Just start from your heart, Grandma. Micah, I think that a part of me always knew that you would leave. I knew that you had dreams, and I swear I never wanted you to abandon them. I just... I didn't know how to let you go and keep you close at the same time. And after your father died, I... I knew the thing that I feared most would finally come to pass, and I was right! Mom... We all know how hard Dad tried to keep us together. And... But if you think that the only reason I stayed here for all those years was because of him, you're just wrong. I stayed for you. But you're leaving because of me! No, I'm leaving because of me. I made a promise to myself, a promise that I need to keep. But if it's... if it's gonna hurt you this much... No. No, Micah. I know what your father meant when he said that we had to stick together. He wasn't talking about here, he was talking about here. Micah, I want you to have your dreams, baby. Wherever they may lead, I want you to go and get 'em! Please, promise me that you'll keep me close. You can't get any closer than my heart. Oh! - I love you. - I love you, too. Oh! Thank you, sweetheart. My girls! Remember these? Ah-ha-ha! - Oh! - Wow... I would be so honoured if you would wear them to the festival tonight. So we're going? Oh, yeah! The Chapel women will be in the house! Oh, gosh... Oh... Habari Gani? Kuumba! Today, on this sixth day of Kwanzaa, and the last day of the year, we pledge to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it. And I must say that Mary's Town looks more beautiful than ever tonight. Now, everything I learned about Kwanzaa I learned from one man, Mayor Riley Chapel. So I think it only fitting that I ask his family to join me here on stage tonight. Please. Yes! And as the elder Chapel, Miss Tess, would you do the honour of the reciting the Tamshi la Tambiko, the Libation Statement, please? My pleasure. "For the motherland, cradle of civilization; "for the ancestors and their indomitable spirit; "for the elders, from whom we can learn much; "for our youth, "who represent the promise for tomorrow; "for our people, the original people; "for our struggle, "and in remembrance of those who have struggled on our behalf; "for Umoja, the principle of unity, "which should guide us in all we do; "and for the creator, "who provides all things great and small." Thank you. - Hey. - Hi. Ah... Happy Kwanzaa. Happy New Year. Same to you. Thanks, thanks. So, how'd things turn out between your mom and grandma? Great. My mom is moving to Chicago... with my grandma's blessing. Wow. "Wow" is right. But it's okay. They're okay. And are you? You know, it's funny, this whole... chasing your dreams thing. Dreams don't have zip codes. Sometimes it takes going away to realize that your dream can grow wherever you feel the sun shining on your face the brightest. Wherever it gets watered. Wherever your roots are the deepest. Habari Gani? Imani! Oh, Grandma, I know you don't want a new logo. I was just doodling. I like it. Could you change the letters to a different colour, like bright red? Oh...? Okay! So, missy, did you finally sign the lease? No, I decided not to get the building. Did you find one you like better? Yeah, 424 Maple Street... Mary's Town, Pennsylvania. I finally realized why I was reluctant to sign that lease. I'm not ready to put down roots in Boston. I want to come back to the roots I already have. Oh, sweety! That is awesome. Look at this: one leaving and one coming back. Yeah, well, you know, it was actually Mom's decision that made me realize what I wanted. It's not easy to leave home. And it turns out it's not easy to come back. So, thank you, for inspiring me to be brave and to follow my heart, like you're doing. Aw! Even though my heart is leading me right back to where I started. Well! The heart wants what it wants. Yes, it does. Speaking of which... I think I need to speak to someone else, too. You know, everyone's been wondering why I delayed signing a lease on this building and starting my own business in Boston, and... I'm not even sure I knew the answer until I got here. But... I've been in Boston for all these years, and... I don't have a life there. I don't have a family there. I don't... have a community. I don't have a purpose. Or a you. I don't have a you in Boston. Sit? I thought I had to go away to find myself and my purpose, but it turns out it was here all along. What are you saying, Ella? I'm saying yes. To you. If it's not too late. Wait... I want to start my own design company and maybe even a youth art program... right here. Are you serious? In Mary's Town? There's no place like home, right? That's right. And I gotta say, there's no one like you, Ella Chapel. Never has been. Ditto, Mayor Knoxville. - So...? - So...? Should we start over? Start from scratch? Or should we pick up where we left off? We'll talk about it! To all of you, to all of us. To Riley. To my mother, and my daughter. My roots and my wings. To family, to community, to unity and purpose, to holding each other down, 365 days of the year. To all of us pulling together. Or as we say in Swahili... Harambee! Let's get together Come together, children
