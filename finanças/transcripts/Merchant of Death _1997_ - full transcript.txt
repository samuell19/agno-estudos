[music playing] Jimmy, come away from there. It's too dangerous. [music playing] Give me the ball. Mommy! Dad, throw me the ball. OK. Go deep. Deeper. Come on, Dad. Throw me the ball. [music playing] Jimmy! Yasmin! Lunch is ready! I'm coming. [music playing] Buenos dias, Senor Randall. What's going on? It's all right, honey. Forgive me, Senora. I come to talk to your husband. We come to help you change your mind. Look, I told you people a thousand times before. I'm not selling, and that's final. You leave me no choice. Mommy! Yasmin! Mommy! [gunshot] Yasmin! [gunshot] Oh! [laughs] What are you doing? Nobody was supposed to get hurt. You killed those people. Shut up, Gringo, or you next. [music playing] [screaming] [thud] [laughter] Today's your lucky day, gringo. [laughs] PRIEST: Oh, Lord Jesus Christ, please look down upon this gatheringand bless all who come here. For this is a gathering of pain. A family passed. Friends, mourning a tragic situation. Lord Jesus, please help the surviving child. [music playing] [tires squealing] [gunshots] [yelling] [explosions] [gun shots] [yelling] [gun shots] [yelling] [gun shots] Woo! Yeah! [yelling] [gun shots] [explosions] [gun shots] [yelling] [maniacal laughter] [helicopter whirring] [tires squealing] [police sirens] [gun shots] [yelling] [gun shots] [explosions] [yelling] [gun shots] [tires squealing] [gun shots] [explosions] [gun shots] [yelling] [glass smashing] PANELLA: Can you tell me how this could be allowed to happen? OK, boys. I'm in a position to offera general amnesty, boys. Give me Panella. [gun shots] Don't just stand there. Kill the bastard. [tires squealing] [police sirens] [police sirens] [gun shots] [police sirens] [tires squealing] Any sign of Panella? POLICE OFFICER: That's a negative, Bennet. Shit. [explosion] [yelling] [gun shots] [explosion] [screaming] [explosion] [gun shot] [gun shots] [machine gun fire] [screaming] [gun shots] [screaming] Get that son of a bitch. There are four cops dead, Randall. Somebody is going to have to take the blame. This isn't fucking Bogot . You should have cleared it with Washburn. - Sam. - Bennet, calm down. Dammit, Sam. I'm about to lower the boom on Panella and Randall here decides to play Superman. All that time andplanning down the crapper. Planning? Policeman are being shredded, Sam. I had to do what had to be done. Your men got killed becausethey couldn't obey orders. My men got killed becauseyou put them in harm's way and ordered them not to shoot. Is that so? JIM RANDALL: That's right. HARV BENNET: And Isuppose it's also my fault that the evidence we neededto finally indict Panella went up in smoke? That's right. What the hell were you doing anyway, Randall? Excuse me? You had no business being there. This is the city of Portland. We're the police department, remember? Agent Bennet, will you kindlywait for me in my office? I'd like a word alone with Captain Washburn and Sergeant Randall. Then you and I'll get tothe bottom of this thing. Fine. We'll do it your way, Pembroke. But I'm telling you now, I'm not letting go of this until this reckless hot head has been adequately censured. And he will be, I assure you. Hang on, chief. Let's hear Jim's side of the story. CARL PEMBROKE: What's the point? Different day, same old shit. I should've come down on him the first time when his hot dog antics got Gardener plugged. Instead, I listened to you and cut him slack. Now I gotta be the one walkinginto the commissioner's office with egg all over my face. Bennet is DEA, Chief! I don't want to hear it, Sergeant. You're off active duty, pending a full review and psychological evaluation. There's nothing wrong with me, Sam. Says you. Only it's high time we foundout for sure, don't you think? Would you ask Dr. Weathersto come in here please? RECEPTIONIST [ON PHONE]: Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Hello, Captain. Detective. Doctor. Well, if you're ready, Detective, I suggest that we get right to it. Get right to what? The preliminary interview. Doctor, I'm going to haveto ask for a rain check. If you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. CARL PEMBROKE: You gothrough that door, Randall, and you're done. Your re-instatement is contingent upon your full cooperationwith Dr. Weathers here throughout the evaluation process. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Good. Well, doctor, he's all yours. It'll take about an hour, Detective. Shall we? Listen, Ms. Weathers. Nothing personal, but I really don't feel like wasting my time on this. And I'm sure you feel the same way. It's Dr. Weathers, Detective. And you know what? I don't have time for your bullshit. So if you're not willing to make the effort, then you do me a favor andyou let me know right now. Well, you heard Pembroke. I really don't have a choice, do I? Uh-huh. You want to keep your job? Then I suggest we get started.- Doctor. I've been out doing police work. So if you don't mind, I'd like to get cleaned up before we do this. If that's all right? That's fine. I'll be in here. Hey. Everything OK? Fine. I'm at Rudy's [music playing] How're you doing, Rudy? All right. What's that for? The next time shitclouds are headed your way. I think I need a bigger one, Rudy. Well, it's the thought that counts. Hey, Rudy. You think I'm nuts? You're a cop, remember? Oh my god. [ominous music playing] Ah, Dr. Weathers. How was your session with Sergeant Randall? I think it went about aswell as can be expected. Good. Chief Pembroke, why hasn't Detective Randall already undergonea psychological evaluation? Oh, ask Captain Washburn. Really? Oh, excuse me. You have a good day, you hear? You too, Chief. DR. WEATHERS: Detective. What happened to you this afternoon? Surprised I haven't heard from Pembroke yet. I'm willing to give you alittle latitude, Detective, but I do have my limits. So why are you here? Come on, doc. You must understand that apsych evaluation isn't exactly, you know, good for my career. Now, hypothetically, ifI did have a screw loose, would you be able to help me tighten it up and keep my badge? Hypothetically? Yeah. I think so. JIM RANDALL: These are interesting pictures. My one passion as of late. Besides work, that is. No, I really like them. Thank you. That's flattering. [pager beeping] Could I use your phone? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sam. Yeah, it's Jim. What's up? No shit. All right. Look. I'll get Gordon and run right over. Come on, Sam. He's my snitch. All right. All right. I'll meet you there in 10 minutes. Bye. I got to go. Let's at least reschedulethe preliminary interview. I really got to go. Look, I'll give you a call tomorrow, and we'll set something up.OK. Fair enough? OK. Fair enough. OK. [ominous music playing] Look, I know he's your contact, but if he's got anything solid on Panella, I've got to take it to Bennet. Yep. How did your meeting with Doc Weathers go? It went fine, sir. Good. Jimmy, you know I've always keptmy nose out of your business-- Yeah, and that's a side ofyou I always appreciated, Sam. Look. What happened to your family, it was terrible, and it was unfair as hell, but-- Wait, wait, what are you getting at? You can't go on like you are. It's eating you up, Jim. I hear you. Yeah. But are you really listening? Sam, I'm listening. OK? Easy, you sound like my wife. So where do you meet this guy? He's usually hiding in somedark corner like a little rat. There he is. Hey, scumbag. Holy shit! Bennet's not the only one I've pissed off. [gun shots] On three. 1, 2, go! [gun shot] [gun shots] [tires squealing] [explosion] [gun shots] [motorcycle engine revving] [gun shots] [gun shots] [explosion] [screaming] - I know another way out.- OK. - Ready? - Yeah. Go! Holy shit. This is one big trap, Jim. Come on. [gun shots] Reload. [gun shot] [explosion] [screaming] [gun shot] [screaming] [gun shots] [yelling] [machine gun firing] Sam, come on! [gun shot] [screaming] Up the stairs. OK. [machine gun firing] [explosion] Now what? Ladder. [machine gun firing] SAM WASHBURN: Jim! Shit. Easy. Easy! It's all right. It's just a scratch. Come on. Come on. Off the ladder. All right, Sam. Here you go. Holy shit. It's the only way down. [explosion] [yelling] [glass smashing] [water splashing] Come on. Ah! All right. You're all right. Take it easy. You're kidding? Jim. Jim, I've got to talk toyou before it's too late. What are you saying too late for? You're going to be fine, Sam.OK? Just take it easy. Your parents. I was there. Sam. You're delirious. Don't try to talk, OK? Just take it easy. SAM WASHBURN: I'm telling you I was-- I was there. I didn't know they were going to do it. I tried to stop them. You know me, Jim. I mean, I tried to-- you've got to forgive me, Jim. You got to believe me. What are you saying, Sam? Who? Who, Sam? I didn't get any names or reasons. I-- I've been trying to find out. You know, get some justice so maybe you-- you could let go of the anger. What did you find out, Sam? Hyperion Exports. Antoni-- Antony who? PANELLA: Hello, Detective Randall. You know what disappoints me? That I can only kill you once. [gun shots] [screaming] [police sirens] JIM RANDALL: Sam? [police sirens] [tires squealing] POLICE OFFICER: They're over here! Is he all right? What about you? Jim? JIM RANDALL: Emma, I don'tknow what to say to you. Are you OK, Jim? You look like you've got a lot on your mind. I don't know how this is going to sound, Emma, but I was there when-- you know, at the end. And he was-- He-- he told you, didn't he? Oh, Jim. How long have you known? Well, he never told me. But the night of the murders he was a mess. A few months later, he saidhe'd been mixed up in something terrible but didn't elaborate. I was scared. I'm afraid to know anymore so I didn't push him. Well, then when he took you under his wing-- but to this day, I refuseto believe he actually-- Emma, he told me he didn't know what they were going to do, thathe actually tried to stop them. I believed him. He was a good man, Jim. JIM RANDALL: He was about totell me who else was involved, but he couldn't finish. Emma, if there's anything-- anything at all that you can tell me, please. There's just that. Sam had no idea that I knew. Kind of nice, Sam, but it wasn't much help. Detective Randall. I am so sorry about Captain Washburn. It must be very difficult for you. Yeah. What's this? Officially, your case is closed. But if you would like to talk, please feel free to call any time. Free now? Yeah, I suppose. I mean, I teach a class at one, but I-- I'd like to show you something. [music playing] This is what I wanted to show you. That's where they landed. I read about the killings in your file. It's tragic, the senselessness of it all. Yeah. That's what I thought. Till last night. What is this? Just read it. I don't know. This is indescribable. Now I know why he wasagainst a psych evaluation. You have anyexperience with hypnosis? Yeah. Some. Why? I don't know. Just curious. Come on. It's getting late. We better get out of here. Rudy. How you doing? I'll have a bottle of Sambuca. Handed in my shield today. You're kidding? No. Give me that tray of shot glasses. How are you doing, buddy? I've been better. Yeah. With Sam gone, Pembroke wouldhave got you sooner or later. Yeah. I suppose. What you going to do now? I don't know. Got a lighter? Well, you need anything,you know where to find me. You ever hear of Hyperion Exports? Hyperion? Hyperion. Yeah. Sounds familiar. - Listen, Billy. I want you to go back to the police station, get on the computer, find out all you can on Hyperion Exports for me. OK. Now is a good time. Fine. Hey, that ain't a good idea, buddy. Ah, shut up. OK, boys. Drink up. I buried an old and dear friendtoday, in more ways than one. [knocking on door] You're late. Oh, love what you've done to the place. Real homey. JIM RANDALL: Is that it? Hyperion file. Legit business is paper goods,but unless their side line is luxury car stories they'reeither running a chop shop or a sweet little fence. What the hell is this about, anyway? Something to do with the-- Yeah, yeah, something like that. Fine. Don't tell me. Hey, you got a beer? Whiskey would be better. - Hey. Aren't you on a job? Don't you have any work to do? It's my afternoon off. Billy, I've got a lot of work here. Come on. Very nice. Very nice. Put my ass on the line for you. You can't even offer me a lousy drink. Here. What the hell is this? That is beer, whiskey,whatever you want, Billy. You're welcome, Randall. Get a drink. Yeah. Yeah. [music playing] This is private property. Yeah, sure. My mistake. Hey, I thought you were going to call. BILLY GORDON: Phone was busy. So what do you got? You mind telling me why you're taking pictures of a major underworld kingpin? I'd rather not say, Billy, OK? You think Birch is one of the killers? I don't know. Christ, man. That was 25 years ago. The trail's gonna be ice cold. Yeah? OK. I'm gonna go. Hey, Billy. Do me a favor. Keep this under your hat, OK? Sure. No problem. Thanks. [music playing] Mr. Canning. Mr. Fitzhugh. Mr. Fitzhugh. Pleasure. Mr. Mayor. Oh, no, no, no. That's Bob nowadays. Take a seat. Can I offer you anything? A coffee, water? I'm fine. I'm fine, thanks. What exactly is it you're writing about? I hope you don't mind. No, of course not. Go ahead. Sam Washburn. Washburn? Wasn't there something in thenews just last week about a Washburn? - Yeah. Sam Washburn was captain of drugs and vice for the Portland PD and diedin the line of duty last week. Oh, right. No. Terrible. Terrible tragedy. Other than that you didn't know him? No. No. Not that I recall, no. What's this actually all about? Well, I've been working on this story about, you know, those crazy peoplemake false accusations how big corporations are powerful individuals like yourself. Well, a friend of mine at "The Oregonian" forwarded a letter to me that was sent to him by Sam Washburn. Now, why this is interesting tome is Sam Washburn, a captain of the Portland PD, doesn't exactly fit the file that therest of these crazy people tend to share. I see. JIM RANDALL: Do you remember theRandall family murders in 1974? You were in office then, weren't you? Oh, yes. Of course I remember. Terrible thing. Terrible tragedy. Terrible. Terrible. Well, you see, Bob, in thisletter that Sam Washburn sent, he claims that the partnershipyou formed with Hyperion and El Condor, well, he claims thatyou guys conspired to murder the Randall family because you wanted to drill oil on their farmland. And of course, they wouldn't sell the farm. Oh, preposterous. JIM RANDELL: Of course. Look, I can dig out the title deed for you. It'll take a little while.- Not necessary. Got a copy right here. And the paperwork indicates thatthe farm was sold three weeks before the murders happened.You see. JIM RANDELL: Hey. Take it easy. Don't get me wrong. I never believe any of this crazy talk. You see, I'm looking for the thing that links all these crazy people together that fits them into this little profile of mine. Now, I understand youdidn't know him yourself, but maybe somebody at AnchorHolding did know Sam Washburn. Mr. Fitzhugh, I am Anchor Holding. I've made every decision here from day one. Well, then, I guess his problem is with one of the other guysfrom the other two companies. You know, Bob, you couldsave me an awful lot of work if you could hook me up with connections over at Hyperion and El Condor. Here. This is what I'll do. Evelyn, will you jot downsome information for Mr. Fitzhugh on Anthony Birchof Hyperion and Herv Velazquez of El Condor. He'll pick it up on the way out. Thank you. That's terrific. My pleasure. I'll tell you what. I'll contact them for you, Herv Velasquez and Anthony Birch, and tell them you'll call them. And here's my card. Give me a call if you want anything else. Thanks a lot, Bob. Really appreciate it. Thanks for your time. My pleasure Hey, don't forget. Send me that article when it's finished. OK? - Will do. Good. There you go, Mr. Fitzhugh. Thank you. [music playing] [knock on the door] - Jim. - Hi. Can I come in? - Yeah. Of course. Just thought I'd take advantage of that offer for a little talk. So what did you want to talk about? Remember the other day Iasked you about hypnosis? Yeah. JIM RANDALL: You see this guy. This is Anthony Birch. He's kind of a famous criminal in this town. I have reason to believe he was involved in murdering my family. One of the reasons is that it's his eye patch. I kind of had nightmares about that. I once read that you could hypnotize a person and they'd be able to remember things they never remembered before. Sometimes that is possible. Yes. I want you to hypnotize me. It can be extremely traumatic. JIM RANDALL: I understand. I'm willing to go for it. If you could help me remember some details from that afternoon, it wouldmake a big difference, Maggie. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. OK. Let's give it a shot. I'm going to go very slowly, Jim. I want you to go back to that day 25 years ago when you lost your family. Can you describe to mewhere you were on that day? We were on the mountain. MAGGIE WEATHERS: Mhm. We're having a picnic. It's Mom, and Daddy, and Yasmin, and me. It's a beautiful day. Dad and I are playing catch with the football. Dad can throw the ball so high. He throws a bomb, but it goes over my head, so I have to find it. While I'm looking for theball I hear voices, strangers. When I come back with theball, there's three men and they're fighting with Dad. Can you hear whatthey're arguing about, Jim? The pirate is arguing with Dad. The pirate? Why do you call him the pirate, Jim? He has a patch on his right eye. He wants Dad to sell. But Dad says, no. No. Everyone is getting very angry. This Spanish man, he gets very mad, and he-- and he shoots Yasmin. This-- this Spanish man hitsMom and Dad gets very angry. The Spanish man knocks Daddown and throws him off the-- over-- over the cliff. Dad. Dad is gone, and I'm hiding. OK. I'm going to count to three. And when I touch your face,you'll wake up, 1, 2, 3. [chuckles] What the hell did you do, doc? How did it go? I think we got some good stuff. I'm sorry, I know it's not very professional. Yeah. I know what you mean. But you were right. This was a good idea. Because everything that Icould think of to ask you you answered. Rewind to 1:36. JIM RANDALL [ON TAPE]: Three men, and they're fighting with Dad. MAGGIE WEATHERS [ON TAPE]: Can you hear what they're arguing about, Jim? JIM RANDALL [ON TAPE]: He wants Dad to sell. When I asked you if you had any idea what the man wanted your father tosell, all you could think of was the farm. Well, they were farmers. You know, they didn't haveanything else, really. Then I guess that we have to consider that a possible motive. Somebody wanted your father'sfarm and he refused to sell. So-- Well, I suppose it's a place to start. So, now what? I've got a lot to think about. Thanks, Maggie. This is going to make a big difference. You're welcome. MAN [ON PHONE]: Everything's set. Had a little trouble with the first guy, but I took care of it. That's right. Yeah. Hmm. MAN [ON PHONE]: Want to wait till tomorrow? Just do what I told you, OK? MAN [ON PHONE]: Yeah. WAITER: Here's your tea. MAGGIE WEATHERS: Thank you. So-- so how are youprogressing on your, um-- Dead end at the moment. MAGGIE WEATHERS: I'm sorry. [ominous music playing] [camera shutter clicking] What is it? Nothing. Nothing, I guess. [camera shutter clicking] MAGGIE WEATHERS: Heartsof palm, stuff like that. [ominous music playing] What is it? Ah, nothing, I guess. Maybe the lack of sleep'scatching up with me. Gonna have to do something about that. [rock music playing] Yeah. Billy. Jim. Look, I need a ride. No, I don't to use my car. Just get over here, OK? Great. Bye. [tires squealing] Shit! The fuck is that? Jesus. Don't these guys know we're cops? [tires squealing] These guys are serious. Can we lose them? - Yep. Then do it. [tires squealing] [screaming] [tires squealing] Where did you get your license? I drove a cab in New York. [train horn blowing] There's a train, Billy. [train horn blowing] Billy, there's a train. Got it. [train horn blowing] How did you do that? [tires squealing] [crash] [explosion] Well, you sure lost them, Billy. Yeah. Told you. What's this? Check this out. Who the fuck are these guys? I don't know. But they're awfully interestedin Maggie Weathers and me. They hit on you. They've gotta go for her. Give me your cell phone. [phone ringing] Hello? JIM RANDALL [ON PHONE]: Yeah, Maggie, it's Jim. Listen to me now. I got to talk to you, andI can't talk on the phone. We have to meet in a public place. Do you understand? How about if we meet at themain lobby near the library at the University? Yeah. The library would be great. I'm on my way. Bye. [music playing] [ominous music playing] Is there something I canhelp you gentlemen with? No, thanks. I've got an appointment with Dr. Weathers. And what time would that be? Right now. [gun shot] [screaming] Finish up here. [gun shots] [screaming] We need back up!

Some maniac shot out the security desk. Dr. Maggie Weathers. Where is she? Um, they say that she wastaken away in a black limo. Where we going? They've take Maggie. They're using her as bait. [phone ringing] MAN [ON PHONE]: Dr. Weathers. Who is this? MAN [ON PHONE]: We'llmeet soon enough, my dear. I thought I'd call personallyto make sure you're comfortable. What do you want with me? MAN [ON PHONE]: Your silence, Dr. Weathers. What are you talking about? MAN [ON PHONE]: Mr. Randallposes a serious threat to myself and my partners. And by association, so do you. Oh, this is bullshit. I'm not hungry. Suit yourself.

It seems I'm finally going tosucceed where Anthony failed, Pepe. To close the book on the Randall saga. The idiot is on his way here. Hello, Mac. That's right. Listen, I'm going to be in Caracas tomorrow. I want you to pick me up and give me a lift. Don't give me any crap. You owe me big time. If it wasn't for me you'd be injail wearing a dress right now. Now, listen. I'm going to need hardware. Know what I mean? OK. Tomorrow. Bye. [music playing] Hey, when this is all over, what do you say we get together for a beer? You buying? Yeah. Sounds good to me. See you later, huh? [music playing] Sleeping off a hangover in this heat? Must be tough, Mac. Welcome to Venezuela, Randall. You got the hardware? In the bag. Would you mind telling mewhere the hell we're going? The name Herv Velasquezmean anything to you? Velasquez? Some scuttlebutt a fewyears back about the java biz being a cover for coke trafficking, but nothing was ever-- wait a minute. You're not telling me thatyou're going to take out-- Not take out. Take back. You are not smoking that shit in my plane. [propeller engines whirring] [music playing] Reception committee. I hope you know what theheck you're doing, Randall.

[explosions] [QUICK, SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [explosions] [machine gun fire] [gun shot] It's you. It is you. Senor Randall. Impressive entrance. When I was a little boy, Herv , I watched you kill my family. Mr. Randall. What is it you really want? Peace of mind. You'll never get away with this, gringo. Shut up. You drive. Go. [music playing] Where are we going? I hope you don't mind flying coach. [ominous music playing] Adios, Randall! Stupid gringo! [maniacal laughter] [yelling] It was not my idea tokill your family, Randall. Then who? Pull me up and I tell you. I'm waiting, Herv , Who? It was Canning. He's always called the shots. Bob Canning? The Bob Canning? It's true. I'm telling you. It was even his idea to get into cocaine. JIM RANDALL: Why? Pull me up. [ECHO] Pull me up. Pull me up. I'll tell you. Why? We needed big money, and fast. We got it, and more. So much none of us would walk away from it. Canning's connections purchasedmost of my merchandise. Now pull me up. Your dirty little empire, built on the bones of my family. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. We're got a plane to catch. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. [screaming] [thud] Come on. Let's go. Where is your passenger? What do you know.

And I still don't understandwhat you're saying. No, what I'm sayingconcerns your Mr. Randall. [music playing] [machine gun fire] [screaming] BOB CANNING: Now, normally I wouldn't be here for something like this. But after all the trouble he's caused me, I've learned one very invaluable lesson. Never leave to otherswhat you can do yourself. You scumbag. Mr. Canning, sir. Best we get out of herebefore this whole place caves in on us. Dr. Weathers, if you please. [machine gun fire] [machine gun fire] [screaming] [explosions] [machine gun fire] [explosions] Get the documents out of thesafe downstairs and meet me at the back. [music playing] [windows shattering] [screaming] Canning! Velasquez told the truth, didn't he? If you're expecting an apology,Randall, you can forget it. So you murdered my family. Your father's stubbornnessgave me no choice. It was nothing personal. Purely a business decision. Murder is a business tactic. Right? No. I prefer to look at it as a hostile takeover. That's all. No more jokes, Canning. Let her go. Well, doctor. Looks like you only sacrifice to vengeance. This isn't about revenge. I'm glad to hear it. I've got a deal for you. You lower the gun, the doctor lives, and I pay you handsomely for your silence. No deal. Just let her go. Well, can't say I didn't try, my dear. So how are we gonna to do this? Hmm? I shoot the doctorfirst, then you shoot me? That it? - All right. Let her go. Give your beloved parents my regards. [SHOUTING] Look out! [glass shattering] You all right? Yeah.

What in the hell are you talking about? I'm talking about peace of mind, Chief. Peace of mind? You're going to have to be a little less abstract than that, son. What in the hell's this?
