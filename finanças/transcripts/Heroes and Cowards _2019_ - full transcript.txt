- Lea no. - Good morning beautiful, come on, can you at least show me how you look in that dress? - I don't really have time to put on a fashion show. - Are you still mad with me that I'm not coming with you? - Please do, I want you to meet my mom. - You know I have to go back to Moscow. - Yeah, your students are more important than me. - I'll come back in one month for the conference and then we'll visit your mom. - Promise? - I promise. And what about your promise? You're moving to Moscow with me, no more secret missions, no more leaving in the middle of the night. - No more nightmares. You know I will, if I go on like this there won't be anything left of me. I'll put in my papers as soon as I get back. - And what about your brother? - He'll survive, you know what I mean. I have to take a shower. Sorry I'm in a hurry, my mom's waiting. Gwen, stop it, I'm moving it right now! - How many times I told you, do not park in this place and you're not listening. This is the ticket for you. You've got 14 days to make a payment, miss, thank you. - You know me, I'll pay it! - And never come back here again, thank you very much madame. ♪ Finished with my woman because she couldn't help me ♪ ♪ With my mind ♪ ♪ People think I'm insane ♪ ♪ Because I am frowning all the time ♪ ♪ All day long I think of things ♪ ♪ But nothing seems to satisfy ♪ ♪ I think I'll lose my mind ♪ ♪ If I don't find something to pacify ♪ ♪ Can you help you ♪ ♪ Occupy my brain oh yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ - I thought you were coming yesterday? - I had to take care of a couple of things before, but now I'm here. - I wasn't trying to complain to you.

Floyd is a very attractive man but Lea he's a soldier, a soldier in the special forces. - Mom. - Lea, she will be alone a lot and I know how that feels. - What else should she do, she's pregnant after all. - Maybe you're right. By the way, Paul arrived yesterday, he's with his military friends, why don't you go over there and say hello. - Yeah. But you know, I think the boys would prefer to be alone. - Come on guys, try not to smash anything up. - Relax old man, no breakage yet. - Listen to the old man, and you're quite right, yet. You keep doing what you're doing boy, you'll be drinking your beer from the floor, me, I prefer it in a glass. Carries one keg and he's already desperate for a drink. Come to think of it, me too. Now that's more like it. - Why didn't we start with beers in the first place? - Because we have a wedding party to get ready. Jesus Christ, let me get civilians next time. - Where is Floyd? - There comes the Russian groom. - Speak of the devil. - There he is. - We have to have a drink it's your last time for a pint as a free man! - One other problem with this bow tie, it's not really my style. - No certainly not. - It's okay? - No. - Mike, give us some shots. - Okay. - It's one hour we're losing this guy forever. - You're so funny, we can't get wasted this early. - Relax, we're going to make it. - Yeah? - Have a drink. - You guys, you're not even in your suits yet. - We have our suits in the car, don't worry. - Here is to the bride and groom. - Well thank you. - The bride and groom. - Give us one more Mike. - Oh we really have to go now. - No we still have time. - We wanna show you how much we love you. - Really? - And it's not what you think. - That counts as something. - Please do show me.

I'll let you know when to proceed. - Mohammed Al-Laseri has surfaced in Berlin and it's your lucky day. The Germans have given us permission. They keep their little feet under the desks until it's all over. - Beautiful. - Yes, but I'm not sure if you're the right man for the job. - If there's nothing else on your mind, I'd like to get the show on the road. - If anything goes wrong in Berlin, it's your head on a platter not mine. I will not let you drag me into another cluster fuck of yours. And the same goes for your little sequel in the Middle East. Are we clear?

Hi congratulations. - Have you gone completely insane. The Germans are up in arms. - Really can't blame them it's in their nature. - Your job was to take out Mohammed Al-Laseri not five innocent bystanders. - We couldn't leave any witnesses. - This one will not explain itself away. There will be repercussions. The foreign office is basically camped outside my office right now. - You will find something. - You make me sick.

This is Omar al-Matari, the head of the terror organization, Black Sunday. He is responsible for the massacre during the St. George Parade in Stonecross four years ago, killing 128 people. This is is Tirek Mousoff al-Sakari. According to our intel, he's Matari's second in command. And number three, Mohammed al-Lesari. Since noon today, he's no longer in the picture. We have confirmation that Matari and Sakari are hiding in Fort Latakia. Your mission is to liquidate them both. You put a team together, only our best men. My son and his unit and my step-daughter. You take the fort and kill every single bastard in it. Can I can't on you, Philips? - Yes, sir, I won't disappoint you sir. - Something else, no one knows about this operation, not the allies, not the media, not even our prime minister. If we fail, all our heads will roll, get my drift, Philips? - Yes sir, understood. - Good, back to work, dismissed. - Sir. - All right, all right, this is the best party ever. I'm proud of you, you're going to be a great husband, a great father and an even better soldier. Which is about time because up until now you've been shit. - Give me a shot for my brother. Mike, it's all of us. - Shots on the house. - And here comes the other Anderson. I thought she didn't party with us. - Thanks. - Give her a break, let her be a girl for one night of the year. - Hell, in these civilian clothes even she might get lucky tonight. - Yeah Paul like any girl would have you without charging by the hour. - Okay, look I wanna say something. You guys are the reason why I love the army. You always have my back. - And we always give you shit. - And hold your hair back while you puke. - You know guys I wouldn't make it without you. - You'd get your ass shot off without us. - Most likely by terrorists. - Or by you cleaning your weapon. ♪ Oh soldier soldier won't you marry me ♪ ♪ With your musket knife and drum ♪ ♪ Oh soldier soldier won't you marry me ♪ ♪ With your musket ♪ - Do you think that war's a game son? - No sir, do you think we put our lives on the line for fun? - What do you know of our war old man? - Most likely more than you son. Instead of playing in the desert sand, my war was closer to home. So many of my friends, good friends died during the troubles in Northern Ireland. You know, it could hit you any time and anywhere. - Northern Ireland, are you fucking kidding me? - Sorry, we meant no disrespect. - No, no, neither did I. Thank you, good luck. - Maybe he has a point. - Someone's had a few drinks. Are you looking after him? - No. - Looks like we get to go to base tomorrow. - Finally. Sidney. - I'll go. Sidney stop please! Sidney, it was bound to happen sooner or later. - Not now, not on my wedding. The worst part is that he seems to be excited to leave. - He's not, he's just- - He's just what? - That is what we are trained for. You married a soldier. That means more than just a normal job, it's a lifestyle. - You sound like a recruitment poster. - It's really too hard for me. I'm just tired of what we do, never knowing what's on the other side. It's hopeless. Sidney, go to your husband, enjoy your wedding, it's a great day. Come on, let's go. I'll join you in a second. Paul, I'm leaving the Army. - Because of Dad? - No, yes. Because of everything, I used to think that we stood for something. - We do stand for something. Whatever's going on between you and Dad, I mean. - Yeah, the great warrior, yeah. - Hey, come on, that's not fair. - He's such a pain, talking shit. I can't do this anymore. - Listen, I get it, okay, I understand but you have to stay for this next mission. - I can't do this anymore. - Lea, you're the best sniper on the team, we need you. Look, I promise, I'll bring you back safely, then you can do whatever you want. Lea, hmm, please? - It's better to stop now. - Prepare the boat. Okay chaps, I wanna remind all of you, this mission is top secret and will remain culvert at all times. Even the smallest cockups cannot be allowed. All of our lives depend on it. Remember, we're not here to capture this man, we are here to eliminate him. We're not leaving this fortress until every motherfucker is killed, are we absolutely clear? Sir, yes sir! - Are we clear on this soldier? - Yes, sir we are clear. - Today all Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha, the sacrificial feast. When the sun rises, all the motherfuckers will gather in a courtyard of the fortress for their prayers. It is at that moment we will attack, are we clear? Sir, yes sir! - Then move your asses, there's no time for relaxing. We can go now. - You all know what to do, on my go. Go. - You have only 11 seconds, if the searchlight gets you, mission is over. Watch out for them, okay? - Jackson, Wilson, McDermont and O'Brian, you go first now. Anderson, both Andersons, O'Neil and Sturgis, go. Go. - Everything's good now. - We only wait for five minutes, clear? - Mm-mm. - Go. Anderson, your group. Okay guys, wait until all the motherfuckers are in the courtyard, then we take the bastards out. On my signal. Everyone on positions. Are you sure al-Matari's gonna show up? If he doesn't, he will be. - Lea, do you have the right position? - Yes sir, I can see the whole courtyard. - When we engage you must cover us. Yes sir. - Okay, let the show begin. Wait until I give you the signal to engage. Shit, fuck it, engage, engage, engage! Cease fire, cease fire! Pack to part one, ready for the descent. Come on, come on, come on. - Fall back! Fall back! Lea, pull out, pull out now! Pull out now, move it! - Major Philips, we're in our position. Come on move, move, move, move, guns, move it! There's no time, no time, pick another route! - Yeah, come on, come on you- - Yes, yes, okay. Take them down. - They will kill us. - Probably. - I said no talking! - Lieutenant Lea Belova Anderson. Are you Russian? - No British. - British. So, so. Captain Anderson, I'm deeply sorry to ruin your mission. I guess it was rather a secret but now I can't wait to see the reaction of the Russians and the Chinese when they discover that the British are planning attacks without international approval. Diplomatic consequences will be very severe. I was born into a rather large family, five brothers, four sisters. My brothers aren't alive now, having given the ultimate gift to our cause. But two of my sisters are dead as are my parents, killed by a stray bomb. You think you wanna fight this war, that it's necessary for democracy, yes? It is not. You are nothing but the lap dogs of the house of Saud to want to ruin all true believers. You, they already own. British, American, French, you need them so much that you are unwilling to see what is in front of you. A corrupt regime that wants all Muslims to be it's followers, it's slaves, it's subjects. My people only want to follow the word of the prophet. We don't want to have yards or Rolls Royces. We don't go to Canaan to buy drink alcohol with horrors. Ours is the purest land without the holiday of sin. Our women do not wear lingerie from Victoria Secret under their chadors but for the house of Saud you make excuses. We who are pure are the enemy because buying oil and gays from the house of Saud was always more convenient for you. Like you order from Amazon. The prices may vary but in the end you know they will always sell it to you. Because they lust for money always from the teaching of the prophet. Give me an answer. What would you do if you were in your position and you were in mine, would you kill me? - If you touch her I will kill you. I wouldn't think twice. - I know that. I will free one of you to bring a message to your commander. The other one will stay here and will suffer the same punishment as your friend. You have two hours. - When I was seven, Mom took me to the cemetery. That day I discovered Richard was not my father. And you were not really my brother. Mom didn't want you and Richard to know about it. From that day, I just pretended I didn't know who my father really is. - I know. - For me you always were and always will be my real brother. No matter what, I want you to know this, Paul. I don't think I'm going to survive this. - Yes you will and you will go home. - I won't leave you here Paul. I couldn't live thinking I let you die while I take the exit door like a coward. - Lea, we have the chance for one of us to survive. It's not right to sacrifice two lives. - You don't owe me anything Paul. - The decision is made. - You can't do this, we both go or we both die. - Get your hands off me. Get off! - So, British pigs, the person who stays can have this or this. The person who goes is free. - I'll go. - Take him away. - Paul, Paul! - He's not a hero, just a coward. - Mom. - So, after the news of your death, I moved out of the house, I had a kidney transplant, I started teaching again. I've got a dog, his name's Arthur. Three years, Lea, where were you? - What did the Army tell you? - Richard told me that none of you made it out except Paul and the entire operation was classified. - And Paul? - Paul, Paul backed him up. Last time I saw him was at your funeral. But he couldn't look me in the eye. I thought it was guilt. - He doesn't know I'm still alive, Mom. Nobody from my old Army life does and they could never know. And what happened to Sidney? - Sidney, she couldn't except Floyd's death, she lost the baby, she was very fragile. - I would like to see her. - No, you can't. She took her own life. - I have to tell you something, Mom. - You can't stay. - Not here in England. There will be one last mission and then I'm out. I'll find a way to let you know. - So, you are still a soldier. - In a way. - Will I see you again? - Sure. I'm sorry, Mom. - Wind down the window. Papers, yeah. Everything's okay. Take this okay? - Yeah. - Okay, they can go. - Your royal highness. Shall we go inside? How do you plan to receive the payment for you never sold to us. - As we discussed earlier, we'd be open to selling the missiles to you that are currently unavailable. We would only ask that you send the money from one of your Swiss accounts. - Wouldn't that mean it will become public. - Let's just say that I've arranged for a lapse in financial oversight. - I have the delivery times for the missiles. - Thank you. - All in position. - Yes, we are in position. We cannot waste time anymore. - We do it as planned. Three, two, one. - Exactly now, we have many deals still to be made. - Miss. Ferguson will provide the banking details. But we'll make it work. What in God's name's going on here? - The party's over. - I'm not scared of you, who are you, what is this? - Cuff them, shoot them all if necessary or convenient. Stand up, I said stand up! - I've cleared this side. Back to the front entrance, we'll come over! Plan B, the car should come from the front. - Come on, come on, hurry up. Lea, come on. Hurry up, faster. - Don't shoot, the minister! - The British and Saudi governments must hold a press conference announcing their illegal dealings taking full responsibility for their aggressive war against believers in the true Islam all over the world. We also demand the release of all our brothers and sisters held at so-called black sites without due process. Lastly, we also demand the withdraw of all coalition troops from the holy land of our ancestors. - Let's make this short and quick. Our prime minister, weakling that he is is not willing to take any risks and fulfill even one of their demands. This would surely mean disaster and only lead to further conflicts in the Middle East. Not to mention the damage it could do to our standing in the international community. - According to eye witnesses, one of the terrorists is a woman. Do you recognize her? She arrived four days ago under the alias of Elena Petrova with a visa from Moscow where she's lived the last three years. We suspect that she is at least involved in three military attacks, in Iraq, France and Germany. As soon as we get to Lea and her new friends, we strike. - So what exactly are you telling me? - I don't need to explain to you how dangerous she would be to us. And we know that she visited her mother. You free the hostages, send the rest to paradise, including Lea. - You'll never get away with this! I know who you are, Captain Lea Anderson. You're a traitor to your own country. - We'll see who the traitor really is. I've heard enough of his drivel, shut him up and get him out of my sight. - With pleasure. - And you, you want the same treatment? - No, thank you, but if I may, I'd like to ask you a question. - Go ahead. - I gather you were once in the employee of the British Army. Why did you switch sides? You don't seem particularly devout to me. - I was tired of being used by men like him or my superiors, men who have no moral code and hide behind Queen and country to further their own agenda. Who send soldiers out to kill and leave them out on secret battlefields when they fail. And for whom corrupt princes who dare their own relatives, lure journalists into embassies to kill and dismember them, have bombs rain down on the poorest countries in the Middle East. No amount of UN conferences can make up for that. And the worst thing is that we all know about it, have always known and we still sell them the weapons to do it legally and illegally. - Oh no, no, no, no, I believe, I understand but you really think that your demands will be met? - Quite frankly I don't care but what happened today will not remain a secret, that's for sure. Don't get too comfortable. Why I'm doing this to even the scales playing for a team of my own choosing for once. My problem is with people like him. But there are others who have legitimate grievances with you. Excuse me now, I have some issues to attend to. You sure, you don't wanna take the lead? - No I don't like this. - You should, he is the enemy. - What's your point? - Let's get to it. Bak Mousad al-Zakai born in Lebanon, father a lawyer, mother a doctor. Quite progressive for a terrorist. Did I give you permission to spit. Well did I? That's English soil you spit on! Back home, you can spit into the desert sand all you want. Hell, isn't that all you people do anyway? But the only bodily fluids hitting the ground here will be your blood, sweat and tears. I ask you, where are they? Yeah, yeah. - Yes sir? Understood. - Let me ask you again, one more time, where are they? What's that? - Two miles south of the river and there's a factory, a small country road and just follow it to the end. - Thank you. And now. Yeah. - I thought you were going to execute me. - So did I? - So why didn't you? - I saw a kindred spirit in you. Someone who was willing to die for a cause, you were just wrong about what that was. - And you're not angry that this will be my last mission? - No, for the same reason, ours is not your cause anymore. I've seen it vanish before my eyes, especially the last few months. - But I still believe in what you do, that it's just. - That's not enough to kill people for. Since your return from Moscow, I've noticed something else, I think you've found something else to fight for, or someone, perhaps. - It's that obvious? - No, not to everyone but I've got to know you very well Lea Anderson. But remember they will always be after you. They will always try to hunt you down. You can only stop running once you're dead. - Arthur? Arthur! Arthur! - Omed, get up, we're in a trap. - Get them, move! - No! - No! - Come on, kill them bastards! - Lea. - Do you want to kill me a second time. - Lea, please. - Get the job done. - You stay here, you can play with yourself while I do the job. Wimp. - Nikolai, I'm back. Nikolai, Nikolai, Nikolai, Nikolai, Nikolai, Nikolai.
