(Grunts) Sir! Oh, My! My God! What did they do to you? Those people are animals sir, in fact thank God I was with her. We couldn't come in through the main entrance because they would have recognized us. We had to take through the Siberia. - What! - Please. - It's okay. - Please don't let them kill me. It's okay. Oh! You have her shoes here already? It's even of no use. They've ruined everything. In fact, they've wrecked everything completely. They looted her room as well. Ok, do you have anyone in town? Where we can take you to A place where you can stay for a while? - No. - Uhm? - Not even an acquaintance? - No. I could kill for a cigarette right now. (Mild chuckle) Wow! That's the spirit. We will figure out a place where she can stay. First, let us get her to the clinic. Ok, sir. This way sir, This way. (Students Chanting) SIBERIA? In other circumstances, I will ask why they named it so. But, we have some escaping to do. - It's where love goes into pieces. - Oh! Most students sexcapades happen here. I see the irony of course. Sir, Do you believe in love? How was that on the subject? Let's go. You first. - Ouch! - Easy. (Sound of a chainsaw) Ige, what's going on here? Turn off that thing. Why are you cutting down my tree? Good morning sir. Please don't be angry with me Sir. I am only obeying madam's orders. If I disobey, I will be fired from work Madam gives orders and you too, give orders. What orders did she give you? Madam ordered me to cut downthe trees, clear the compound and burn the litter. She says she wants to try interlocking tiles. She wants to erect tall secure fences and buy big dogs to protect the compound. I see… Just pick up your machine and leave this place. Erm..boss, in my opinion, interlocking tiles are not bad at all. Just imagine how dead leaves liter the whole compound. Ige. Trees are reliable. Trees can be trusted. Trees are not like our spouses. Ehn? IVF is good... But who is going to cough out that money to go to the UK, let alone undertake it? Ehn? Ah! No, no, no, no My friend, no. I can t let you do this now. Eh! It's not your responsibility. Awhhh. It is me o. If I wasn't in love and foolish. I would have married Pekun. And by now, I would have been a wife of a billionaire. Ehn! No problem. Ok, I will call you back. Thank you. Is that why you asked Ige to cut my tree? Clean out my compound? Because of some fad interlocking tiles? Is this what we have become? (chuckles) You choose not to let sleeping dogs lie? When I talk now, they will say Remi has started. What is wrong with interlocking tiles? And who cares about your annoying moral high horse? Ehn? I am tired. Do you know that? I am tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. I am tired of this house that remains the same. I am tired of dead leaves littering my compound. Do you hear me? I am tired of this life here I am tired of you. Dekunle, you. I am tired. I am tired of this life here. I am tired. I am tired of you. Mr Folarin. - Dr. Sir. Greetings. - Yeah, morning. - Ah, Prof. - Dr. Adekunle - Good morning sir. - Good Morning. - How is the family? - Very fine sir. - You have a class this morning? - Yes, I do. - Good morning sir. - Morning Abubakar. Please, keep them in the office for me. My class is waiting. - And keep the key. - Under the door mat. Thank you. Let us discuss your literature review later today, say 4 pm? Perfect sir. Thank you, sir. One, two, three, four, five. That's group one. One, two, three, four, five. That's group two. One, two, three, four, five. That's group three. One. I am tired. Three. I am tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. Four, five. Do you hear me? I am tired of this life here, I am tired of you. That's group five. Sir... - Sorry, where were we? - We have five groups in all sir. You said? I said, we have five groups in all sir. Ah. Good. Make sure to make a list of all the groups. And Include all the leaders of each group and bring it to me before the end of the day. Noted, sir. Errm... Remember each group will have only fifteen minutes. Make sure to enunciate your points clearly. (Students) Ok, sir. And please, Keep to the focal points. (Students): All right sir. Cheers everyone, I will see you in a week's time. (Class Captain) Thank you, sir. (Students) Thank you, sir. So, I know the most beautiful girl on campus. Cordelia. (smiles) Keep teasing. Can we go for breakfast now? Oh no, not now. I need to see my lecturer first. Would you like to come with me? Alright, its fine. Lead the way. How was your class this morning? Very well, thank you. May we come in sir? (Knocks) Sir? Yes, you can come in. - What's your name again? - Stella. Stella. What can I do for you? Errm. Sir, I hope nothing is wrong sir? What do you mean by that? Well, uhm…, The other time in class, I thought... Ok, well you seemed a little off I hope you're not ill, are you? (scoffs) I'm fine… Thank you for asking. Or you don't want to talk to us? There is no problem really. It's one of those mornings. There is nothing bad about your morning. In fact, your classes are always exciting and I never fall asleep. I'm not perfect Stella, maybe one of those off days. He doesn't want to talk to us, let's go. Is this your wife? Yes. It must have fallen off your desk. Thank you. Very pretty. Yes, you are very… (Laughs) 0h! You are very right. (smiles) Its ok sir, pardon our manners. I'm Cordelia-Nwanze Peters. Part-two Law. The same Nwanze Peters? The chief of staff supreme headquarters? He is! He's the same. He is her father. I didn't know the colonel has a daughter here. Well, I prefer not to make a big deal of it. And I prefer others not to. I'd rather be known as myself, for what I am. Rather than someone's daughter all the time. No luck, I'm afraid. Very soon, you'll become someone else's Mrs. How did you know sir? She's hooked. Head, body, tail, All. Everything is... Telephone without wire, why are you comfortable spilling other people's secrets. Why? I am glad to meet you Cordelia. And when you see your father, extend my regards. He is my favourite in this present administration. Ok. Thank you. Thank you. Adekunle, there is fire on the mountain. - What is it? - Come, come, come and listen. What's happening? There is fire on the mountain. (Martial music) A Coup. A Coup? We can't be too sure yet. - Let's listen to the announcement. - What's really going on? We don't know, lets listen. (Radio broadcast) Fellow Countrymen. In the name of the Revolutionary Front of the Nigerian Armed Forces. I announce the successful ousting of the floundering, insufferable. And failed administration of General Matthias Kalarima. Kalarima was weak. - Was? Is he dead? - Shhh… indecisive, truly powerless and beholden to a cabal that is intent on maintaining its parochial, selfish... and amoral interests at the expense of national development, progress and unity. Unfortunately, they have also planted their minions in the army. Thereby turning the army into that proverbial finger of a leprous hand... If the army is compromised, then we are a breath away from anarchy. This purge is therefore necessary to safeguard the future of our nation. We are now calling for all hands to be on deck, to chart a new course for the nation. If you are on the side of justice, equity, national unity and progress then you have nothing to fear. But if you are on the side of those who wish to perpetuate the unhealthy... and intolerable status quo, then we will not wield the sword in vain. Simply put. We will brook no opposition, disobedience or rebellion. Whether it be in the form of media propaganda or protest, civil or otherwise. To this effect, we are banning, till further notice, all political, cultural, tribal and trade union activities. Together with all demonstrations and unauthorized gatherings. This is Colonel Nwanze Peters, on behalf of the Revolutionary Front. - Long live the Republic. - Colonel Nwanze Peters? I just spoke with his daughter a few minutes ago. My God, Cordelia! Cordelia! Cordelia! Her life could be in danger right now. (Students chanting) We no gree o, we no go gree! Let's go. (Students chanting) We no gree o, we no go gree! Tope, Tope what are you doing down there? Leave there. (Students chanting) We no gree o, we no go gree! Leave there. (Students chanting) We no gree o, we no go gree! (Dial's phone) (Students chanting) We no gree o, we no go gree! (Dial's phone) Any luck? None. His phone has been engaged for ten minutes. More announcement from Nwanze. Because the Revolutionary Front has deemed him and his deputy incompetent. And incapable of leading this great nation. The constitution is hereby suspended. And all airports, seaports and borders are closed forthwith... That's it? No word on Kalarima and his deputy if they are alive or not? Probably not alive. Going by the choice adjective Nwanze used in describing them. Barely a year after the last coup, we are in the throes of another. It's like a game for them. I never would have guessed Nwanze, the reluctant leader would overthrow his boss. Remember the expose Newswatch did on him? Initially, he was tipped to be the head of state, but he refused. Preferring to serve under Kalarima. Allegedly, I don't trust any one of them. (Phone rings) Yes? Who have you been talking to? Oh! Remi. Who else? I have been trying to reach you for how many minutes? It's been engaged. To much free time on your hands ehn? Is there a problem? I am coming to get the car. You had it to yourself all of yesterday. And so? You don't need the car to move around now, do you? Or do you need a car to move around your office? Anyway, I am coming to get it now. Listen Remi, I don't care if you need the car. But a coup just happened about thirty minutes ago. That's a lie, how? Turn on the radio, its all over the news. Its not wise to leave the house right now. Let alone drive around town, It could be dangerous. Remi? Fine! You see, one has to be very careful with what one says especially this time. No one can know if there is a mole planted to fish out dissident academics. You are right, I need to try Remi and see if she listened to me and stay… It is too late. See. E… excuse me. How did you get here? I got a lift. Now, the keys. You didn't notice the commotion on campus? On your way here? - That is left for me to worry about. - Still, its not wise for you to… You know its mine, right? I reserve the right to. You are telling me, I cannot have the car because it is yours? That ancient locomotive. Lower your voice. This is the key, you can go anywhere you want to go I don't care. No, you will tell me now. Let me know. Whether to go get myself another husband. At least we know men who can afford to buy Mercedes Benz cars for not just one wife. But as many as they pick. - Remi! - Remi what? What? Is it not you that wishes to see the devil in me every morning. Useless man. I know what you are trying to do. But I won't let it happen. You are not going to disgrace me in my place of work. Mr. man, shut up and sit down. You are very good at disgracing yourself by yourself. What are we going to feed on? Pa... Pa... Papers? Answer me! Because I remember when I was in my father's house, I did not come for you. You came, crawling on your belly to beg for me. - Lower your voice. - What do you mean lower your voice? Am I shouting? Dekunle, am I shouting? - Sir. - Stella. Do you know her? What happened? She is one of my students. One of your harlots you mean? Ha. Stella… Take it cool. Take a deep breath. Good. Now, tell me what happened. Giggles. Sorry o, Mr. doctor, welcome. Can I get her some water? Birds of the same feather. Please, thank you. Ehn, ehn? Sir, it's Cordelia. The students, they are about to kill Cordelia. You must come and rescue her. I knew it. I knew they would come for her. - It's the colonel's daughter. - Oh! Can you take me to where she is? Are you strong enough? - Yes sir. - Good. Keep an eye on her. Ehn, Dekunle, what's the whispering about? Err. Do you think I am stupid? - Ha! - Remi. Let me see you step out of this room. It is me and you today. The car that you refuse to give to me. Now, you want to go and take one girl somewhere. Let me see you walk out of this room, I will show what I am made of. The young lady, one of our students is in grievous trouble and I have to go and help her out. Your student indeed. So, you are now the warden of Nigerian students, right? Sorry o, Sir Galahad, rescuer of damsels in distress. - Welcome ooo. - Excuse me ma. Who told you that you could speak? You have no shame at all, you realize that this is my husband? Err Remi. Please, the longer we stay, the more danger the girl could be in. - If I may speak. - You may not o. Mr. Ahmed, you may not. All you men do is protect one another and stick together. So, you may not. Ok, Ok. Go and wait downstairs by the car You can see her out. - Are you sure? - Yes, I am. Take the flask of water with you for her. I am all yours. - So, you think that… - I agree. We need an intervention. You air your grievances, I air mine, we let it all out. All this back and forth, it's not healthy. You? Agree? I'm serious. Let me first get the speaker's staff. What is that? To ensure you are fairly heard. - Dekunle what is speaker's staff? - It won't take time. Dekunle! Dekunle! (Adekunle's voice) Remi is inside, don't open the door for her until my car is gone. (Ahmed's voice) Ok. Dekunle! Stella, let's go. I am so sorry for whatever happened up there… No, you didn't do anything. Get into the car quickly, let's go. Now, where is Cordelia? She is in the hall sir. (Students chanting) No to the Coup, No to Nwanze Peters, you are Nwanze Judas. How did you get through this? (Students chanting) No to the Coup, No to Nwanze Peters, you are Nwanze Judas. Sorry, excuse me. Please, open the gate. I need to go in. Are you blind, can't you see the students? But I belong here, I need to go to my room. Where did you go before? Did you inform me you were leaving the hall? No road, go back to your boyfriend. There is no need to insist, they will not let the students in. I think Cordelia will be fine. Sir, you don't understand. Cordelia is in the box room. She will suffocate, the room has no windows. I had to hide her there so that they won't attack her again. Good, God. Err, madam porter please come. It is an emergency. It is a matter of life and death please. What is it? What do you want? Baba Ruka It's you sir. Have you been moved from the gate to this hall? It's only temporarily because of the students crisis. She is my ward, I need to get some of her things out. Hey! Hey! Hey! Please, Please, Please. Please, let us go away in peace. Please We are on the same side. There is only one enemy and that is Nwanze Judas and he must pay. Please. Listen boys, I know and feel your frustration too. This coup, nobody likes it. It's obviously insane. We no gree o, we no go gree. These soldiers can't keep treating us the way they like. I agree with you. Power to the people. We will fight and even give our lives in the defence of freedom. But let us not include the molestation of defenceless women, even if they are on the other side. Let us not behave like our oppressors. We are not without decency. Even if we are angry, it's because of these animals. Who have wrecked our country, is that not so? Yes! We are mature and we will prove it. Ehn, please. Let me take this wounded girl to the clinic so she can get treated. Please. Thank you. Come here. Stay on campus, don't go and face armed soldiers and police officers on the street. Don't give them the excuse. Yes sir. - Aluta! - Continua! Nurse. What am I doing? Coulde you please... - Please hurry up. - Make this snappy now. What am I doing like this? I'm looking for the file now. At least you should have an idea of where it should be. Is that not what I'm checking? - No! we have been here since. - Since 8am. Nurse. Please, she will like to see a doctor immediately. Is she a first-time patient? Well... She's never been here before... She did some exercise - she fell from the stairs and... Fill this…. You can go sit over there, I will fill this out. Sorry. Everything will be fine. We will make sure nothing happens to you. Thank you, sir. There is fire on the mountain! They have killed the Head of State! We have to get out of here now. What's going to happen to me? Ah! Cordelia. The more time we waste, the more danger we are in. Sir, where are we going to take her now? We take her to my house, she doesn't know anyone in town. Your house? What happened in my office was a misunderstanding. My wife will understand. I need to get back to the hall, I need to pack a few things. My parents must be worried about me. Ok, I won't leave you un-protected. I have a first aid box at home, I will try and clean Cordelia up and come back for you. - Thirty minutes. Deal? - Deal sir. Go. Is that not the girl? Is that not her? That was a narrow escape. Are you hurt? (Giggles) I don't understand? You find the fact that we were almost lynched funny? But it's all so exciting. Ok, so don't get me wrong, I mean I'm the one whose life is at stake. (Continues to giggle) You find it exciting? 0k, right. I know you are angry about your car but then. The truth is, this thing is not befitting of your status. In fact, I think you should have donated it to the national museum a long time ago. But to tell you the truth. You know, when it didn't start, I mean your car. I got this fright. I got... Terrified. I didn't know what to think. Cordelia, Cordelia. What if those guys had laid their hands on me? What if they wanted to rape me? It's ok. Listen, Listen! Your physical well-being is of more importance to me, ok? We need to get you to the hospital for clean-up. Breathe, Breathe. It's ok. I will get one of my neigbours to drive us through the second gate. It's far away from the hostel. We will get there, we get a taxi and go to a private hospital. We'll figure the rest out as we go. First, we have to get Remi. You see. This was what I met when I came to let your wife out. Why she was busy shouting so loudly that I was so afraid that the roof will come down. That you wife, she is something else! Please, I have to go right now. Thank you. No! No! Ah! My research. Two and the half years of... (Screams) Is everything ok? Sir, look out sir. Look out sir, look out. Ha! Are you jinxed? Calamitous loony. You better arrange to propitiate your essense to avoid crashing into misfortune. Lunatic. That one beside you is surely your ruin. Crazy people. You almost got us all killed. We escaped a mob only for us to get killed here? For what? What were you thinking? (Breathes heavily) (Groans) Are you okay? That's my house. Those soldiers must be here for a reason. Shoot! How did they find out so quickly? What are you doing? Your head. Listen, this is not the moment to take risks. Those soldiers must be looking for you. The problem is we don't know whose side they are on. Your father's or the old government. (laughs) Please... This is not the time to start this your laughter again. It's not my fault sir. It's not. It's the pain. (sobs) Sir, I don't want to laugh, but if I don't I'm going to cry. It's going to make you further distressed, because you've been so kind to me. It's okay. Just hold this down, so it stops the bleeding. No, no. Sir, we can't just leave like that. What's going to happen to madam? Your wife. My wife! Oh! Sir these soldiers, they are here for me. If they don't see me, I don't know what they are going to do to your wife. - We have to go in. - Hmmm? We have to go in. No. She cannot suffer because of me. I don't want her hurt because of me. Sir. Hmm, I will walk in there. My father tells me every time that everyone dies only once. - So, I am going in. - Wait! Wait! Let's play it this way. I'll go in to find out. If it's safe, I'll come back to get you. What if it's not? Take this. That's all I have on me. If I don't come out in the next thirty minutes, see that road down there? Take it and go left, you come out to an open road take a taxi and go straight to Lagos. Find your father's friends and stay with them. Please, stay away from the barracks. Until things get cleared. Ok? Ok. Goodluck Cordelia. They are in your house. Soldiers. Remi cannot be abandoned. I will go in there to meet her. Everybody dies once. - You are welcome again. - It's enough. - Thank you. - Enjoy. You are a very beautiful woman. (Smiles) Thank you very much. And the beauty mark, is it natural? - Oh, this one? - Yes. Oh, no. It's something I've always done since I was a child. You like it? (continues laughing) Halt! Who goes there? Advanced to be recognized. Who are you? My name is Adekunle Benson. Oh! You bloody civilian. Follow me. Go inside. Oh. Here, he is. You're welcome sir, We've been waiting for you. My name is Major Kawale. What do you want? What's wrong? What happened to you? (hisses) - Excuse me please. - Ok. Thank you. Please, sit. Wine? Thank you. Your wife... She's an amazing host. What else can I say, we aim to please. Let's get straight down to business. Where is the girl? Which girl? I don't know what you are talking about. You are lying to me and you know it. I am trying to be a gentle man here and treat you like a gentle man. But you're pushing my buttons. I have my orders. Where is the girl? I am telling you the truth, I … The girl! Cordelia. I've got to get her now. Your wife told me she came to see you. And then someone came to see you and then she distinctly heard the name Cordelia. Ask my wife to get her for you. Cordelia. Uko! I'm fine, I promise. The rightful owner has taken over. How strange life is. You know, I got tired of waiting for you in the car. You know I kept wondering what could have happened to you, so I just thought... Oh! Why don't I just come in and you know give myself up. And guess who I found here. Major Kawale. My fiancé's brother. Cordy, we need to go now. Oh! Papa send you for me? Yes. And we are behind schedule. How is he? I mean with all these things happening. I will explain to you in the van. Major... The girl may look alright, but she needs to see a doctor urgently. I will take it from there. Madam, please can you help me say thank you to your husband. He is one of the finest men I have ever met. - Thank you. - Let's go. Thank you. (Mild chuckle) (Groans in pain) (Groans in pain) Poor you. You must like that girl very much. The way you worry about her. You have never shown such concern for me before. Have you ever been in a trouble like that before? With people hunting you like an animal? All I hear is big, big words. As if I am not a woman. As if I didn't see if from the first time I set my eyes on her what is going on between you two. Look, Remi. Remilekun! There is nothing between us. I saw her when... Only this morning. I saw her for the first time only this morning. Yes. I believe you. I believe you. Just don't provoke the army. Hmm? And for my sake you better not bring any disease into this house. (plays Piano) Days there are, when your mountain seems barren of green compassion... And your valley too is a thirsty bowl of sand aching for water... and there are no seeds in the air to lull the birds back to your branches. On such days you must come to me and ask for my strength as you know. Sleepy mountains sprout. Into busy groves on my lap Valleys wake again. And become talkative with water... And songbirds leave my hands, to populate your afternoons! Yes, come closer, how can despair continue Anywhere there is friendship, Call say "Friend!" and see, how quickly I come to your side... (continues to play Piano) Let's see if the mother of your children can play and sing like I can. Excuse me? Is that not what you want? Ah ah! For me to leave so that she can take my place. What am I? Nothing but a useless barren... piece of rag only fit for wiping the floor with and discarded afterwards. Not even good enough to be washed and kept. But to be dumped in a heap of trash. To create room for a shinier and a cleaner one from the marketplace. Remilekun! Ah ah! Remi... How long are we going to continue to patch up things. Only to open up the wound again the next morning. Dekunle... Remi go to your room right now, lock yourself in the bedroom now. - But, - Now! Where is she? Where is the girl? Who? Ah! Ye! - Where is the girl? - Ye! Ah! Remi. Ah! Leave her! (screams) I don't know anything. Shut-up. Where is she? - What have you done to her? - What is this? Ha! - Talk now. - Wait, What is all these? What have we done? Where is Cordelia? Is that why you are beating us? Your people came and took her away. - Came and took her away? - Yes. - Boys! - Yes sir! I think we are late. They must have handed her to the rebels. I didn't hand to anybody. Her father sent somebody, the major to come and take her… Shut up! I say shut up! Her father my foot. - Boys! - Yes sir! Arrest them. They must be collaborators with the rebels. - Ah! Remi - You see You see your wandering have caused. Shut up. Move. And search the house. Move! Move! Move! Move! 0fficer, No. Leave my wife alone. Move. Sir. We couldn't find the girl. This bloody civilian has handed her to the rebels. Officer, I don't care where you take me to, But my wife, she has nothing to do with this. It's my fault. I'm telling the truth, let her… Ha! Take the woman back to the house but detail one or two boys to stay with her. She is not to receive any calls or step out understood? Yes sir! - I want to come with my husband. - Remi. - Move! - Let me go with my husband. Please let me go with my husband. Please this is not necessary. Morning sir. The suspect and escorts are outside sir. Let them in. You can come in. Morning sir. Now, Tell me all that happened. Every detail. How did you get Cordelia? How did you do it? Go on... I don't know. It was in my office when one of my students came in, they both came in together. This morning was the first time I laid my eyes on her. And then I had issues with my wife and then… The coup happened. I was going home to go and pick my wife whilst trying to save her. Then... How did they know she was in your house? Somebody must have told them. You are in great trouble my dear professor. You seem to know more about this coup than you are telling me. No. - I don't know… - No need. Please, I don't know how it happened. But... It's ok if you are not going to talk voluntarily. I am telling the truth sir. We have people who are trained on that here. They will make you talk. There is no need for this, I am telling the truth sir. But I have something else to do. Please, try and listen to me. Please sir. Take him to the guard room. - Permission to carry on sir. - Please sir. Please sir. Please sir, let me… (Groans in pain) Turn now! Turn! Turn! Turn! Please. (Groans in Pain) (Groans in Pain) (Soldier's voice) Where is the girl? (sobbing) I don't know, your people took her away. (In pains) Please. (Crying) Who put him there? My friend! Did I ask you to put him there? Bring him out! Who put him there? Yes sir! Sorry sir. Bring him out of there. Get him out of there. Get him out of there right now. Who put him there? Bring him out! Get him out of there right now. Professor! Professor! Can you… Can you hear me? Professor, Professor. Professor, Can you hear me? Can you… - Colonel Nwanze Peters? - Yes. I can't believe what these boys did. I… I sincerely apologize for the way my men treated you. Misunderstanding or not. Its ok. It is all water under the bridge now. No, it's not. I mean their overzealousness almost cost us your life. Really, it's alright. I'm only worried about the damage they did to my house in the course of ransacking the place. Oh, that. I am going to make sure that you are adequately compensated for every damage. You have my word on that. Thank you, Colonel. Please eat. You barely touched your food. Professor... I'm sure that you are probably wondering what this is all about. You woke up this morning, you heard my voice on the radio announcing the coup. The coup was foiled. Here, I am again. It is the work of that boy that came to your house. That one that could have been my in-law, Major Kawale. The one that came and took Cordelia. I didn't know that he was that ambitious. You know using Cordelia's name, he got me to follow him and then they kidnapped me. Then he and his friends, they forced me to do that recording. But I am also a soldier you see, so, I managed to escape. Then the coup failed. That was when they went and grabbed Cordelia from your house you know. But my boys got there late. But now, we know where they are holding out. We will move in tonight. They are finished. - Hmm? - After what happened I have my name to clear. What about your daughter? (Sighs). Those are the risks. These rebels... I think they think that they can use her to bargain. There is no way for that in government. All the government is interested in is to put an end to this mutiny. And have those coup plotters eliminated. Nobody in government wants to succumb to blackmail. Especially over a girl. So, Cordelia is completely dispensable. They will kill her. If you close in on them, they are going to shoot her. This is a war. Ah! That's why I asked you to come, You know. Come with me. I can delay this attack for at most one hour. And one hour is time enough. During this one hour... I can take personal risks. Behind the military's back. Go on. Ok, so my plan is to… My plan is to send an emissary to Kawale. Yes. Would you go for me? Ehn? Me? I know it's dangerous But it's not necessarily lethal if you follow my instructions. Believe me, I would not let you risk your life stupidly, if I didn't think there was a chance. You really don't have to go if you don't want to. - I'll do it. - You'll do it? Thank you very much professor. Thank you so much. What will you have me do? Very simple. All you have to do is just carry a letter from me to Kawale. Then, you make sure that Cordelia is alive. That's very important. Ask them to take you to see her. Then, you speak to her yourself. Because I want to know what her condition is. After that, Kawale will send you back to me with a reply. What if Kawale does not like it? And he decides to detain me to? I don't think Kawale will do that, not after he reads my letter. But, I agree. You know I told you before, that this is a risk. You know. - You really don't have to go. - Its ok. - If anything happens to me, In case, - Yes... You have to take care of my mother and my wife. Won't you? I promise you, you have my word of honour on that. I'm going to stop here okay? The house is up there. Up there, by the right. When you go, you turn off onto the dead street. It is the third house on the left. It's a small one storey building, it's painted white. It also has a gate and then you will see number 3 boldly painted on the gate. You understand? So, you just go inside, press the bell and then ask for Major Kawale. There it is. - Goodluck. - Ok. Wait! One of my men found this after the, you know what I mean. Thank you. And this. And this. Thank you. Goodluck. - Is that ok? - Yes sir! Stop there! Who are you? I am here to see… My neck, Please. My neck, Please. Who are you? (screams) Ah! Who are you? I have a message for Major Kawale. Who is Kawale? How do you know he is here? The message is urgent, you are wasting time. How do you mean I am wasting time? Who is that? Ha! It's the professor. Bring him up to Temp HQ. Yes sir. Wait. Well, Well, Well. Professor... What message do you have for me? And how did you know I am here? I am sorry Major; my instructions were to talk with you in private. Very well. Very well. The colonel gave you this? I am sure you can recognize his writing and his signature. His signature, Yes. What beats me is... Why you? Why would he send someone like you? Given the circumstances, the Colonel cannot trust any soldier. I'm sure you understand. Well, Major I think you have to talk that out with you men. In the meantime, I will like to see the girl. The Colonel emphatically states that I... I see her and report back to him. The girl is fine. You can tell that to the Colonel. She is my brother's fiancée, isn't she? Well, if you must see her for yourself then... Of course. (Rings a bell) Take him to see the girl. Move. (Dial's phone) Hello, Sir. Cordelia? - Ah! Cordelia. - Yes. - Is that you? Are you ok? - Yes, I am. Oh! Its you we are worried about Cordelia. Are you hurt or something? No. Poor papa is he fine? Yes, he's fine. He is fine. Cordelia, everything will end very soon. Let's go. Yes, sir! We have considered the Colonel's offer. And we have decided to accept. We will give up our weapons, And surrender. Because, I know the Colonel is a man of his words. And I trust him. But only him. You hear? Only him. He has guaranteed us safe passage out of the country. As long as his daughter is safe and sound. You have seen her? Tell that to him. His offer is taken, and at the hour he says. It's all written down in this letter. Give it to him. Professor! Thank you. You are a man of courage. I admire that. I hope to see you soon. Thank you. Errrrm. Actually Major, I had forgotten. Please I beg of you. Can I see the girl once again? There is something the father asked me to tell her. I completely forgot. Just once. It won't take a second. (Smiles) Of course. Make it quick. Ok. Hey! Cordelia? I'm leaving now, I just want to find out if you would… (Turns light on) Hey! Go out! Enough! How did you know? Her hair. It didn't feel right. It didn't feel the same. How would you know that? Professor. Don't tell me you are in love with her. Of course not. What a thing to say. I will be telling my brother he has one more rival to contend with. Be sure of that. Take him to see her. (reacts excitedly) What are you doing here sir? Your father said I should check up on you and see how you are doing. I'm fine of course. Why won't I be fine? Plus... Where is papa? Why didn't he come himself? Did the coup fail? He's busy. Time up. It's time to go sir. Time to go sir! - Whatever happens... - Move Tell papa I will always be proud of him. Move sir. Ok. (Continues to play Ludo) What did he say? - Did you see Cordelia? - Yes. How is she? Is she alright? Did he suspect anything? She said I should tell you that she is okay. So, what does it say? Morning sir! - We are ready to move sir. - The boys are ready? Yes sir. You sure you want to lead this… Are you with me? - Very much sir. - Ok. Just give me a minute. - Professor, you'll wait here until I come back. - Ok. You know you have already demonstrated your bravery. Let me put my life on the line as well. So, wish me luck. Wish me luck, bloody civilian. Goodluck Colonel. Fine, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. What are you doing here? I asked you to wait for me. Stay against the wall. You've been here all night? (Groans in pain) Sorry. Here. Thank you. Papa. Ok, I'll just go freshen up. Our man of the hour. I am sorry for being a burden to you sir. No, No, No. We owe you a lot. With the head of state gone... My colleagues in the supreme ruling council have asked that I replace him. Congratulations will be in order then. Hold on. I'm telling you this because I will like to offer you a position in my government. Oh! Yes. It will be really nice to have a man like you. I'll feel so honoured if you accept to be one of my ministers. Alright, I know how sudden this might be to you. So... I can give a couple of days to think about this. Here. This is my card and my numer... My direct line is there. Call me when you make up your mind. To be a minister. It will end this unending battle with a tired car. Tired engine and worn out tires. If I dial the Colonel's number now and say yes, I am willing. A completely new and radiant life will open up for me. I will leave this decaying campus, This miserable house. These... Colleagues greying rapidly... And prematurely with unfulfilled aspirations. I will move into one of those mansions in Ikoyi or Victoria Island… …I will sleep and wake in the serenity and opulence of ministerial priviledges. The noise and the breeze of the lagoon in my ears… …Far from the frustrating chalks of classrooms, the dust of dog eaten papers… …and if I am clever enough, within a year. I who do not possess even a blade of grass at the moment Will have built some magnificent palace for myself. And ensured the future of my family... away from the common squalor of our country. Then, I will buy a house in Europe. So that afterwards, when the government changes... or the people become unruly. I will simply go away for a while. Until things become normal and safer. Hmmm! So tempting. How tempting it all is! Be a minister and like others, forget poverty and misery. Forget the people! Fellow citizens, As you have heard in the statement released today by the Supreme Military Council. I have been called upon against my personal wish and desire To serve as the new Head of State. But I have accepted this honour... in the interest of the nation and in the memory of the late Head of State. I know that he would have wished that... someone should continue the task... of nation building from where he left off. I have worked very closely with him. And shared his beliefs and commitment to the Federal Military Government's policies and actions. I believe and feel strongly committed to all we have been doing. And I can pay him no better tribute... than to continue in the spirit with which he led this country. That of complete dedication. All policies of the Federal Military Government continue as before. All ministries should continue their usual duties. This tragic incident can only lead to greater dedication... to the upliftment and progress of this nation. This situation was brought so swiftly under control... because of the loyalty and dedication of the Armed Forces, And the Police. The Armed Forces and Police deserve all praise and appreciation, from the government and people of this country. Reports have also reached me from all over the country of public support... from various sections of the community. The Federal Military Government is very much gratified... these demonstrations of loyalty and support. (kick starts car engine) At the end of the seven-day mourning period, which was announced earlier. Do you need help with the car? …Is hereby declared a public holiday to enable citizens, No. Finally, I would like to appeal to all of you for calm... and to avoid any action that might cause a breach of the peace. This is a period that calls for continuous vigilance and it is the duty of one and all. I'll take a walk. …In order to preserve the stability of the nation. God bless you all. Where are you going? Your car wouldn't start? How are you? Can I come with you? Actually, I want to be alone. Ok, you can walk with me alone then. So, my father told me about the offer. Are you going to take it? No, No. For goodness sake, don't tell me you are not going to take the offer? (Sighs!) You want me to accept it? Yes, Yes. You should. Believe me, I know my papa. He wouldn't have made you that offer if he didn't think highly of you. I mean, with what you did. See, no one really would have thought there were great men like you in this country. I'm flattered. Sir. Wait a minute! Why am I calling you sir? I mean, you're just a man like the others. I should call you by your name. Uhmmm? - Hmmmm. - Don't you dare. Adekunle. - You… - I am not a student anymore. Remember? I'm going to London. - And you… - No, No. No, don't say anything about it. I don't want to go. I want to be with you. You know that won't work, I'm married already. But anyone can tell you are not happy. Plus who ever even mentioned marriage anyways. I mean, I just want to be able to be with you now and whenever. You know it wouldn't work. Soon, you would be asking for more than that and soon, things get dangerous. For me or for you? Hmmm? Well... Listen, it will be beautiful to exchange all of this for the glittering life of a minister. But you and I know that if I go to Lagos, it will only be for one purpose. - To serve the people. - Yes. I'm afraid I will annoy everyone if the political system refuses me in being myself. No, No, No. Don't look at it like that. Look at it like its an opportunity to do something. To do the right thing. See, my papa loves this nation and he will support anyone who does too. I don't doubt that. But I will rather my servant simple life and its predictability. Overworked and underpaid. If ever I'm going to put anything right like you said, I will start from here, the University. You shouldn't take the offer. I'll talk to my papa. This country has yet not made a place for dreamers like you. What about her? Is she going to be with you when you change this nation student to student? That will be left to me to find out isn't it? Now, run along young girl. And stop hanging around old men like me or your papa will be angry. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'll never forget you. (smiles)
