Look mama, a man going to a carnival. You must not say that. The man is a holy man. He comes from the Pope in Rome. May Lena and Jacob greet the nice man? Yes... (in Italian) Where can you rent a pedalo? (in Italian) Spitting on the ground is forbidden. - Amen. - Thank you very, very much. They really are a man with the heart in the right place. THE KING CASTLE TOUR. (the lady scolds) Hello, there is trouble in the second room. NO ACCESS FOR UNAUTHORIZED. Take care of the lady, Johansson. Book a taxi. - Has His Majesty told you... - No, sir... Heck too, he's probably still... - But if Mr Jonsson... - The name is Soderstrand. Ah yes, sorry. The court is expecting two significant people. They are accompanied by the Chief of Protocol from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hr. Soderstrand surely understands that it is impossible to tell, - - why these people come this way. After all, Mr Soderstrand will soon - - show them through the door there. That room is always locked, sir... Exactly, except when I give the order to open it. I understand. And who will they ask for? Chamberlain, Baron of Silverstolpe. But otherwise: Discretion, Mr Soderstrand. Discretion. I'm expected. Count Gosta of Lejonsvans from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The chamberlain is waiting for you. This way. (knocks on the door) Yaah... May I present: Signor Vittorio Ferruchi and his daughter, Marcelina. Good day, signorina. Good day, signor. And it's Lejonsvans... Here you are, do sit down. - I guess you prefer to speak English? - Yes, we both speak English. Marcelina has started practicing Swedish, right? Yes... I'm sorry you were taken in through the back door. But this is a matter of extreme delacacy, you understand - - so we could hardly have used the front door. Please, we understand... So it is the young lady who is to marry... ... our king. May I congratulate the Ferruchi family on the great honor. We are overwhelmed over our good fortune. Signor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shares your joy. Italy... the land of culture and beautiful women. Yes, that's right, old boy. Between us, we Scandinavians want fresh blood in our royal families. We are too mixed up with too many Greeks and Frenchmen. My Marcelina will fill the castle - - with Italian bambinos and bambinas. This brings us to the question of the transfer fee. - The dowry. - Aah yes... yes, yes! It's embarrassing to talk about money in a love affair. But the cost of a royal wedding is colossal. And the king must bribe the church with several millions. Otherwise, the archbishops will do a hell of a lot, - - when our royal family converts to Catholicism. I'm delighted to make a contribution to your king's happiness. And for that money, the Ferruchi empire gets a lot of publicity. Yes. Yes. And you have brought... ... of 10 million Swedish crowns? Yes, in large bills. They must be impatient to meet the young gentleman... One moment. -Dad! - Marcelina! She is only a child. Hello... Majesty? Yes... thank you very much, Your Majesty. Yes, they have arrived. Yes! If you wish. I would say about 50-70 kilos. Size? I'm guessing a little 46. Yes... and a sweet little black mustache. Yes, you can say... so much... Yes sir, the Majesty will arrive in 5 minutes. What do you say? Okay, okay. Goodbye, Majesty. Since this is a family affair, - - the king suggests that mr. Lionsvans and I retire. May this meeting be unforgettable for you and the signorina. What shall I say to the king? Just let him look at you for a long time. Then he says what to say. -Ciao. -Ciao... thanks. Ouch, ouch, ouch! Cab! Listen to this... Can't keep your fingers to yourself for 5 minutes? A large part of this is to be used for that. You are a bad representative of our country. Shame on you! Come on! Hurry up! Come on! Give me the folder! My couain ia foinf the main train station and me, Arlanda. -Pappa, non capisco. - Speak English or Swedish. You must practice. For two hours we have been waiting for the king. Bambina mia, be patient. Maybe he has a surprise for us. Maybe your father will be a count. Count Ferruchi of Calabria. Marcelina, you must say no to your future husband, - who will make you Queen of Sweden. - Rikard, just one more time. - Write to me soon. (plug jumps) I have not received tap water since Valde's break in Gentofte. This one is paid for in Swedish crowns. Cheers! I don't like it before Rikard's here. As long as he has not been seduced. If he's met Liza Minnelli, he's coming because of them. I assure you, Marcelina, bambina mia... I swear by your mother's life that I will find the two thieves. There he is! Rikard! Then come with that hat! You most beautiful among maidens. - I'm feeling hot. - I have clean shirts for you and packed for you. Why is it always him? I get completely mad when I see him like that. All the girls. They have been lucky. Where else do you find such a chest. It looks like the wall in a public restroom... Hurry up, Rikard or we miss it. I have to apologize for that. (speaks softly to her) George, look at that dog. lsn't he the most darling thing you ever seen? Does he not remind you of all the happy Danish faces we have met? -Wouldn't the kids at home just love him? - Maybe. I would like to give... 100 dollars for auch a dog, maybe 2? Yours? I've always wanted one like that. What is his name? - Tom... Box. - Tom Box? How interesting. - Tom and I are getting divorced. - Why? Because I got a job in the United Nations... no... -No dogs. -Oh, poor darling. But the kennel has promised to take him back. What about selling him to me? To me? Oh, George, I must have that dog. George! George...! -How much? - It's a family member... -How about 100 dollars? - What about 200? George... Well, bye-bye Tom. Do not forget old Denmark. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Come on, Tom. Last call route 421 to Zurich exit 17. Final call Swiss Air... (excited voices) This is my dog ​​... There he is! The length of the sentence is due to the fact that you have damaged Denmark's reputation - - by fraudulent conduct towards foreign guests. And you have hurt the feelings of all animal-friendly Danes. Quiet, mom's best friend. Now mom is done soon. Did you understand? Six months. Listen here, Don Luigi, godfather! It's not about the money, but about the honor of the family! - Look, is he not nice? - Si, si... Da-da-da... Beautiful as his grandfather. When we find the two scammers, what then? I'll leave that to you, Godfather. Aah, excuse me! So, so, do not cry. Give Grandpa a kiss. (baby cries) Should they be stabbed, shot or drowned? - Preferably no details. - Well, we'll keep you posted. Thank you very much, Don Luigi. See you later. Ciao. Get hold of the head of the family in Scandinavia. - He must find the two men soon. - And liquidate them? No, first we find the 10 million. Swedish crowns, - - and then we kill them. So we stand up, Viktor Hansen! 40 smokes, roulade, 2 plates flooded with nuts. Fine. Just put it there. Should I put it in your account? Have you thought about it with the crew of that boat? We can hardly get out to the island with Morgan's treasure without a crew. Nah, that! Do not speculate about details, old boy. Think... 40 mio in gold and precious stones. Maybe a little more, maybe a little less. At least enough for you and me. Holy hell! - Do you need to yell like that? - One can anticipate, right? - I could imagine chicken. - With sauce and potatoes. And cucumber salad. Are you sure that the treasure map is correct? At the Danish Technological Institute, it has passed the carbon 14 test. The test said year 1665, give and take. The ink was 40% oak bile. The parchment was made from the skin of the capretto goat. I knew that. There's no one who can run around with corners with you. Your lawyer is here. Please sit down, Viffer-Hansen. Thank you, Superintendent. Yes, Viffer-Hansen, I've talked to your mother... You are the biggest idiot in the world when we could had it made. Get in the slammer for a dog over a measley $200. Can I help it I like my job. Just like you's dusting off ladies. I keep ladies and business sharply separated. Because you have 10 million, you do not stop working, sis Onassis stop? I could have let you sit here and even nibbled the pennies. No, you would never do that, because you are my friend, Rikard. Hear the name of the bank and the account number. I do not want to hear a sound. - Why not? - Because I'm talking in my sleep. Tomorrow, everyone here will know that number. There will be charter flights from the prison to Zurich. It's too dangerous if I am the only who knows. What if I have an accident? Go home and stay in your bed until I get out. In 5 weeks. Time is up. The smokes from this morning, 1/2 chicken, a butter wreath, - - 2 beers, 1 red wine = 57.60, only for today. I cannot keep laying out. You rave about a couple of lousy pocket change, - when you want to get your hands on a treasure in a couple of months, - - so you can buy your own penitentiary. I have taken my wife's household money. She lost 10 kg. Okay, okay. Jump off. Spring! I would like to talk to the director of the prison. He looks like someone who's up for a chance. He also wears bigger shoes. That's probably why he's become a director. Here is the plumber to look at your sink. -Buona sera, signor. -Buona sera. There's a hole in the sink, si? The plumber's dog has a black mustache. Rikard, damn it! Good morning... Your Majesty, you must marry a chicken... (the sound of water dripping) (the sound of water dripping) That was it, Viktor. So we met Kalvebod Brygge on Tuesday, 14 days... - The ship's name is Queen Marcelina. - Yes. A shame we had to bring more aboard. Yes, but raising the treasure is not free. Here is 300 cr. from the prison priest. We cannot keep him out. He has 5 children. So Tuesday 14 days, then it goes loose. So long. - What was your name? - Andersen. Goodbye, Andersen. Psst! Psst! You must not psst of me, your community parasite. Viktor, it's me, Rikard. You are high. I am ashamed. Get away from me! - Where is the cart? - It was too risky. I have atoned for my brother. Do I have anything to fear? - No, but I have. - Can't you slow down a bit when I am used to only walking meters? Do you remember you said I should stay in bed? I followed your advice. Just not my own bed. But the lady was engaged to a certain Mr. Moeller. Your ladies should not introduce you to the whole family. - Moeller? - Moeller. - The clump? - The clump. You may well pray for your Father. Come! - That's not all. - Can it get worse? - There are others after us too. - Not the police, what? No, someone has ransacked the apartment 3 times. Arthur, you know what to do. So someone knows about Stockholm. They will know where we have placed it. - We have not written it down. - I have, Viktor, for your sake. If now something should happen... You have not written down the account number and name of the bank? I've put it in a place where no one can guess. Only you. I've put it on the back... Let's go over there. You have to memorize the number, then we will meet in Switzerland. - And share the money. - I'm in. But imagine if the clump has a surprise... at an altitude of 3000 m. (bulldozer noise) Listen now and remember! First, I say the name of the bank. - And then the account number. - Wait a minute. Not in that spectacle. - Say it then! - First I say the name of the bank! Rikard, say it again! I did not get it. Rik... I thought I had explained, - - so even a few sheep's heads understand. But no. But I explain again. The two guys have grabbed 10 million corone svedese. And we wish them, si? But only the two know where money is. So we wait until they pick them up. Easy work, right? No, not easy. Why not easy? Because do not make sure one of the two guys is not killed. And the chance of finding money now is only half, understand? Buono, and now you hear properly: Man who is left must be kept alive until we have money in hand! After this moment you have only one duty: To see that nothing happens with Viktor Viffer-Hansen. And believe me, Carlo... And believe me, Dino... Otherwise you so dead. Understand? Understand? Good! - Did you find anything, Viktor? - not so much as a goldfish. Dear Rikard. Dear Rikard. If only you were here now. But where Rikard is now, he does not need money... I have. The last thing Rikard said was, - that he had written down the bank number, - and I was the only one who could guess where. He said: "I put it on the back..." Hereuka! It's Greek. That's what Socrates said, - when he invented the square of the circle. Lily, I have it! He has tattooed it on his back! He has tattooed it on his back! (rings) (sounds soothing music) So, little lady. Time heals all wounds. And our company is on your side... May I express my deepest sympathy with... My little Rikard, my dearest, only I had. There is nothing like a mother's grief. - I want to see him again. - You'll come too. We must all meet on the Great Day. - I cannot wait that long. - Now try to control yourself. If you leave your son to our company, we will do everything - - to equip him... beautifully for his last journey. It makes me unspeakably happy. So you took good care of him? They've had him since last Monday. They said that at the Forensic Medicine Institute. Is the one we're talking about, the little overpainted hippie, - - which the public has burdened us with for ten days? Then you can pay storage fee. This is not an office for forgotten cases. I was on my annual vacation in Acapulco. We were gathered at Hotel Eden Roc, - - when the sad message came. Otherwise a wonderful season. We were all there: Sinatra, Dean Martin, - - Madame Pompidou, Kissinger, Victor Borge. - And Jackie. - Well, dear lady... - Margarita de la Bona Fide. - Mrs de la Bona Fide. The first night, Jackie Onassis sat with me. But if you've had any trouble in the meantime, then... Dear Madam, We must do everything in our power... We want Rikard to rest in the family grave on the estate. It has been in the family's possession for generations. Little Rikard has played like a cop. He loved the forests and the large fields. So we must bring him back to the land of his ancestors. I understand that so well, madam. Where do you want him delivered? I was wondering if I could get him now. The family is waiting for him. - I'll call right away. Can he sit in the front? - Is he downstairs? - No, he's there. God no! What do you want to do then? You have to ask about that. 'Whatever has been on Rikard's back, it's gone up in smoke. Poor Rikard, to end that way. And yet! Now you have to sit still. You want to look cute, right? - Yes, come in and sit down. - Hey, you little toddler. God, it's you, Viktor. Buses, you have no idea how I've been thinking of you. You have not changed your mind, have you? Are you letting me in anyway? That's not my style. What about the hunting motif with the fox going in the cave? Won't say where. Otherwise, thank you, I've known one tattoo fool, you know. Yes, poor Rikard. I heard about it on the bus. I had to go straight home and go to bed. A lovely boy. - And a good customer? - Good? He was the best. You've seen his torso yourself, honey. A monument to my work. A shame you did not make his upper body fireproof! Now you must sit still with the little arm, sweet darling or it will be ruined. I was thinking... if Rikard has been here lately? Sweet friend, he ran in and out of here. Four times a month. - The same nonsense every time? - Girl names, hearts, phone numbers. - On the back? - Nah, on his arm. Yes, it should definitely be on his arm. I honestly think he fell somewhat out of style. The last 4 times he had "larvae" with him. I was going to tattoo hearts on them too. - What should it say? - Don't remember, numbers, letters... - Can t you remember any of it? - No... - Not even the girls' names? - You know, that's not me. No, it's not you. To hell! Aarh no, now I spelled mom with "d." Never mind, we're making a butterfly. Imagine tattooing the name of the bank and the account number on the 4 broads. - It proves one thing. - Where the money is? That he could charm the panties of anyone. That he could charm the panties of anyone. Even the prioress at a convent. No, do not ash on Rikard. - Are you afraid he's gaining weight? - Let me have the memories. Now it's about finding the 4 bitches. See the chest! There are as many women as the cobblestones in Vesterbro. Talking about memories. His robe, may I have it? I have to pick it up in person. Ugh, ugh, ugh...! Away, away! A magnifying glass! Connie, 42 11 19. Majbritt, 28 66 45. Merete, 51 66 12. What does it say? 22 88 40, Janne. "I put it in the back," he said. On the back of the toilet door! That was what he meant. Majbritt, Connie, Merete, Janne. 4 phone numbers for 4 gals with tatooes. Will you note it? Could I talk to Ms. Connie... - They're talking to Connie Soerensen. - They're talking to lawyer Gravesen. The company Gravesen, Gravlund & Gravballe. - I would like to talk to you. - About what? It's about... something quite personal. Then came my work on the main railway station. The express train to Helsingoer, Gothenburg and Oslo - departs from platform 2. The train to Kalundborg departs in 4 minutes from platform 3. - Miss Connie Soerensen? - God, startled me. Yes, it is me. My name is lawyer Gravesen, Gravesen, Gravlund & Gravballe. - It was me who called you. - �What do you want? This is for employees only. My business is of an extremely pleasant nature. - For them. - Oh... The high-speed train from Aalborg 15.15 is delayed by 20 minutes. What is it about? Do you see, I'm representing our deceased client - - director Rikard Abelsteen. Richard? Aah, he was so adorable. Everything about him was so beautiful. He had the biggest... ... the greatest understanding I have encountered in a man. I actually died myself when I heard about the accident. Hello? Yeah, okay. We regret that the S-train traffic has been temporarily stopped - - due to power failure. - You hear, they feel with us. - Yes. - They must not be upset. - I loved him so much. - I think it was reciprocated. - Why do you think that? Because in his will he has considered you with a considerable sum. Has Rikard? That can't be true, wosies. Hello? Okay. A little boy, Brian, has been brought into the stationmaster's office. How much? First of all, as executor, I must make sure you're a Connie, - - as my deceased client mentions. They can see my health insurance certificate. I think there must be a safer way - - to identify you on what? - Who told you that? - Yes, who... We had received a few items. Otherwise I would never! The high-speed train to Gothenburg and Oslo departs from platform 2. There is no dining car with the train. If I am not wrong, this is probably a tattooed mark which a quick peek can do it. They do not want me to show my bare ass?! - Oh no! Well, that's where it's sitting. - Then you may understand better... - Your embarrassment honors you. - But for DKK 150,000? - DKK 150,000! No, I do not belong to that kind of girls. Why don't we go and get a few drinks? - Sorry I'm late. - Hey, Bodil. I think I have the solution to the problem. They just need to take a picture of the tattoo. Up on the stool, down on the knees, and then... right? - You cannot do that. - For DKK 150,000? There is obviously no way around it. As executor, I will have the estate bear this expense. When I stand like that on the chair, I cannot get the money in the machine. Put yourself in the right position, and I'll put the coins in. - Now I am ready! - Fine. - Can I come out now? - Wait a minute. I would like to see the pictures first to assure you didn't move. God save me. That's my wife. She is going to Backindia. The clump...! Then get out! - What do you want to do with me? - Support DSB. You will be part of the concrete foundation for the bridge over there. - I see... - May I invite you on a little trip? Come with me, Moeller. You cannot stand to see blood. How is your boss a charming human being. Continue. The other side, you idiot. Come on, Viktor. Stop! Arthur, could you imagine half of 10 million Swedish crowns? Turn around in 5 seconds, then it's yours. - Where do you want to get them from? - Yes, you understand... Rikard and I ran into an Italian and his daughter. We lured them into the castle in Stockholm. There we arranged for her to get married - - with the Royal Majesty. - Do you not believe me? - I admire you. Even at the moment of death, you are trying on a scam number. Give me... just one more minute. I need to exchange a few words with my Creator, prepare him. Aah, off, off, off...! Where the hell is he? We go out and look for him. Arthur...! Arthur...! Arthur...! - It was beautifully done. - Now we only need one thing. To get at Viktor Viffer-Hansen! What the hell is wrong with my mailbox? (cat meows) Oh... Kitty, kitty, come here. Kitty, kitty, go away! Mentally retarded cat, in 5 minutes... Now I have given him the dairy treatment, Mr Moeller. In a moment he will... (there is a big bang) Lawyer Gravesen, I'm sorry for poor Rikard. - They were close to him? - Yes. But I'm getting married tomorrow and traveling to South America. - Honeymoon? - No, I have to live there. - Always? - Yes, counting on it... I have to run. Goodbye. Dammit! - Watch and Hear. - Picture Gazaette. The Barber Gazette! Congratulations! Congratulations! - Thanks. Can I? Well... Well, I do not really know... Should it have went in under the table? If you step back a little, the press can get a picture. Not now. Wait! That's fine... Thank you. We better go around a bit. Here you go, the next lady! That you could do it! On her wedding day! It was my 10 million. against her 2. - QUE 628... - That does not mean anything to me either. Not until I've seen the last 2 butts. Merete Kroell Knudsen, daughter of the shipowner. - He calls the cops. - He scratched off 1/2 year ago. The mother is a von Baumbille. A von Baumbille always lacks servants. - Go ahead, take a seat. - Thanks. After all, their references are neat. 15 years with Baroness Lejonsvans in Blekinge. - Reportedly an adorable human being. - Right to the last. Then 8 years with Chancellor Adenauer in Bonn. And since? After the death of the Chancellor, I had to take a sabbatical. Then I nursed my mother, but now she's gone too. - I am sorry. - That is the way we all go. -Aah, I'll die if I don't get some tea. -Our new waiter-drivers Offenburg. God knows how long you will last. lh... av... av... Mr. Van Cleef, how nice to see you. This is Merete, my daughter. They can speak Danish, my mother is Danish. How funny. Come on in. Offenburg takes the luggage. Lovely little place here. Mr. Vanderbilt shows up on my father's yacht - - and we're already invited Henry Kissinger, Liz Taylor... What did your poor mother do? - A little persuasive, madam? - No thanks, Offenburg. My dad went ashore and bought a bigger yacht. Offenburg, I would like a little salmon. One should never disappoint one's friends for a lousy 1/2 million dollars. Merete, Arnold's father was a good friend of your father. - It is said. - A little flood-horseradish. My dad said: Make the trip around Denmark - - and greet the shipowner Kroell Knudsen's family. Thank you, Offenburg... Arnold, it was beautiful of you to come. Merete and I see too few people, right? Yes, otherwise nothing will ever happen here. ... Thanks, no horseradish. Is this your first visit to Denmark? I come mostly to the Middle East to look after our oil. A little more wine, Offenburg... I do not remember my husband talking about your father. Otherwise, they may think they had something in common. They were buddies. Papa cried when he was told that the shipowner had left. Going away... How moving. Did your father take it so near? And all the big plans they're going to make together. Your husband must have told you about Captain Morgan's treasure? Offenburg! Sorry, ma'am... It's been given 1/2 hour too little. Captain Morgan's treasure... My husband did not believe it. Not in the beginning. But he was convinced, - - when he saw the map showing where the treasure is. How did you know the map was genuine? Papa carried it to The National Physical Laboratory. There they gave the carbon 14 test. It said the year 1665. How interesting. The ink was 40% oak bile. The parchment was made from the skin of the capretto goat. But you should not take chances with 8 million dollars. Maybe a little more, maybe a little less. But every thing must be examined carefully. - Could the lord imagine a little one? - Very kind, Offenburg. - Is this Picasso real? - Everything in this house is genuine. With one or two exceptions. - lce? -Thanks. - Soda? - A few drops. That's how I like it too. What are you doing? - Aah yeah. Cheers, you old man! - Who do you think you are? I know who I am, but who are you? Arnold Van Cleef, son of Jeremiah Van Cleef, Houston, Texas. The closest you've been to Texas was when you saw Bonanza on TV. - What do you think you are doing? - aHa-ha-ha. The one with Captain Morgan and the treasure... It's not working. Captain Morgan and the Treasure... it's a story I've invented. - Viktor Hansen. - Then not... Viffer-Hansen? - Cheers. - Damn! .If I knew it was your area, I would not have shown up. - What did you expect from this? - Approx. 50,000. 100,000 if you do me a favor. Can you take photos? - Want something special? - Merete's left buttocks. - Are you in the porn industry? - Uh, I'll leave that to the Clump. Come on, Arnie boy. Was that strip poker you said? - What about your mother? - She is stiff from acid. Whiskey in the vermouth, vodka in the soup, cognac in the sauce, and rum in the cheese. (clock strikes) - 4 kings. - 4 ace's! Get rid of the pillow, Arnold. - Anything the lords want? - Yes, a real partner. - Can you play strip poker? - Yes. I have to straighten up and stretch my legs a bit. Sit down and give cards. The collar is still missing. Ms. Merete, are you not going to bed soon? Uha, what was that? The necklace... We could also play about who should pick up the next bottle. Now you're going too far. That's your job, Offenburg. Cheers, Offenburg. Merete... Aah...! Ow ow ow... - He's on his way now. - Okay... We're waiting by the wagon. ldiot! QUE 384, DEC 426. OMO 9... No, I have to see Janne's tattoo. I do not understand it. - Hey... did you get it? - I made the stamps. Here is the letter from the Ministry of Defense. And here is your identification. The Ministry of Defense has announced my arrival, hasn't it? Yes, the letter came this morning. It went quickly for once. - My motto is, ma'am...? - Sergeant Bentsen. I'm in charge temporarely. "Do not set up for tomorrow what you can do today." That is as true as it has been said, Colonel Mollerup. They're having a good time here, huh? Yes... as far as I understand, the Ministry of Defense has granted - an amount for the renovation of the premises. Yes, I was asked to follow the training for 1 day. That with the training becomes difficult. It is forbidden to have men in the area during training. To older lotteries can also participate. Older lotteries... - Joking aside. - Yes, why not. Let's tour it. Right...! We have a visit from Colonel Mollerup from the Ministry of Defense. He must inspect the rooms, which must be put in order - - in accordance with the rules of order. Dismissed! We can visit the bedrooms now. I've already caused you too much trouble. I'll probably have to take care of this myself. Yes sir! The rooms are the same. There is the same thing in everyone. Dismissed! That's something you think. - (knocks) - Come in! Colonel Mollerup, Defense Command. - I have to inspect. - Yes sir. Private Frederiksen. Well, You sleep 4 in here. We should see to it that it is converted into single rooms with a shower. And what are the names of the 3 other girls? Here I lie, and Andersen, and here Holm and Sjoett. I have a greeting from my daughter to someone named Janne. - Sjoett is called Janne. - It was not Sjoett. Then there is Janne Larsen further down the hall. And Marianne Holeby. Now I have made my observations. Are you busy? I have to write a letter before I go to bed. - When are you going there? - At 10. Will you show me where the other Janners live? - Of course. - Excellent! I dare not come home without having conveyed that greeting. I think Private Larsen ... Janne, is lying there. Here is Larsen and there Holeby. First they lay in the upper one. But it became dangerous. She weighs 87 kilos. - Thanks. - It was so little, Colonel. In all the kingdoms and countries to which I in the world go I fainted "with an open forehead for what I really think... The colonel said we would have our own room with a bath. He had a greeting to a Janne. - Sjoett, do you know a Mollerup? - No. Is that you, Holm? Why can you not pee before going to bed? Is there anybody? Run, run, run... Everyone held! Ready to heat up... now! And held it. Ready to jump over horse. First jumper, go ahead. Fine. Powerful. lh... aah... aah... Then we move on to the next exercise: the ropes. The 6 first ready! No, now I have to show how simple it is. You grab the rope with your right foot, then to the left, and then to the air. This is done in cooperation between hands and feet. Let me then see who comes up to me first. 031 BAN... 031 BAN... Afterwards, it looks easy. Now I have packed. Also your red socks. What would I do without you? What's wrong? What have I done now? - Now it's all over. - No, I'll be back. Viktor... Moeller, him the Clump, does he not have a gray sports car? - Why do you ask about that? - There is one opposite. It does not look good. Just hand me the binoculars. Whoa... it's him. God knows how I come alive from here? (taxi honks) - Is it the train over Basel? - Yes. Could you show me the compartment with mothers of toddlers? - Right there, madam. - Thank you. lnterzug vor Zurich. The train leaves immediately. Hello, it's not working. They must not come in here. It is only for mothers with young children. I have a small child who needs to be breastfed. Hello, Viktor. I give breast now. You seemed to need a travel party. Moeller! You can't do me any harm - - in the company of a nice German lady, right? - What kind of a German lady? - Hey, Viktor. Hello... Goodbye. Do not worry, Viktor. It is quickly over. In a little while we come to a long, black tunnel. Moeller, I think we should have a little one. - We do not need to have a small one. - Should I short-circuit the current now? It's your fault that 2 of my boys are in their graves. - I don't know what you mean... - Poor Viktor. Moeller, on my honor. Let me fall dead about. It should not last long. Now comes the tunnel. Do come in. There is a lot of space here. Are you a nun? Arhhh! (trying to speak French) God, it was just a joke. - Don Luigi, just one last word? - Dino, let the gentleman speak. Thanks.
