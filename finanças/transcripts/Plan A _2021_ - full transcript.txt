You can hear how you breathe inside Now ... no one can kill me. - Shut! - Annoyed. Our synagogue was here. There I got married. My son was born here. We have to leave this damn country.

Where are they? Tell me. We're neighbors. We were locked in side rooms for three days. I was with you in your neighborhood. Three days later.. The soldiers came and they took us to the forest. We had to dig the ground. When we finish, we they lined up on the other side of the moat. When they ran out bullets, they used their knives. When they got tired, they buried us alive. The last time I saw Ruth she was hugging Benjamin. He was protecting her. I ... Somehow I managed to escape to the forest. The next day they said that the ground was still moving. Some were still alive. But then everything stopped. Sorry. Very sorry. Next... Here. Come on, give me your hand. Let's go fast. Come on guys, hurry up. We are leaving soon. Why did you stop?

I have the right to do this. Michael, I deserve it. Everything you see happens informally. The english no they should learn nothing. We only have two rules. First, we do not work with children and family members around. There must be several sources of information about the suspect. We come from the british military police I'm afraid you have to come with us. Menash. Burn the wound. War trauma. In the same place where men of the SS got their blood types tattooed. What a coincidence. Dirty huh ... We found him guilty of complicity in the murder of innocent people. We sentence you to death. Do you know this person? He was in charge of the eleventh block. You killed a lot of people. Head of Field Security Dachau concentration camp. He shot two Jewish families. Troop security guard of the SS in the Auschwitz camp. For our brothers. We sentence you to death. I do not see. There is nobody here. OK let's go. I think she ran away to South America like his friends. We need two information sources. It's a long process. Did you check the repository? Yes, it is empty. This is how they hang people in the field. On the rope until it falls apart they were leaving. Maybe someone did before us. NAKAM Someone left us a message. Olle Agendorf. Do you take responsibility of your actions? We all have sins. I also. Yours too. Keep digging. Cigarette? Max, can I ask a question? I'm just trying to understand In the ghetto ... you were many. The same is true in the camps. How many people were you protecting? Fifty? Face. There were thousands. Why didn't you do anything? You just walked away obediently to death in turn. Why didn't you resist? They took your children. Your relatives. But you just ... You did nothing. Why didn't you fight them? Menash, that's enough. Leave him alone. Enough. Let's go. Do it. No, wait, wait. - Max, no. - Michael, let him go. Please don't be him. Leave it alone. Follow him, come on, come on! She ran there. He is there somewhere. He looks left. - Menash. - Fast. Here. Where did he go? Menash. Where did he run? Where is the? There is nobody here. You found it? Menash. Max. We come from the forest. War is over. It's really over. Give me back my gun. We do not touch civilians. Where is your humanity? Who are these people? Jewish Avengers. Under the command of Abba Kovner. They call themselves Nakam. This word means revenge in the Bible. Somber. Dangerous. Not as much as our revenge. My brothers. We share the anger not a common path Sorry for not joining us. But at least don't stop us. Let's go. These people are dangerous ... Well ... we can't go back like this. Ahead. I will die. Here the water is ice cold. That? I am a boy from the desert. No, stop. Get in the water, come on. No, I do not want to. Are you okay? Yes, of course. It's okay. Miguel. Thanks. Then, thank you for letting me join. I have not told no one yet, but ... The British know that the ex Nazis have disappeared in these areas. That's why they send us to Belgium. The entire brigade. And the list? It's just a drop in the bucket, Max. We will never find them all. Jerusalem Mountains ... Does it look like these? Well ... they are smaller, but ... they are much prettier. This is the only safe place. Is this the end? Yes for them. I was a member of the Haganah. A military organization in the country. Management wanted me to stay on top of shadows and take care of all kinds of problems. For example, with the Abba group? For them, every German is guilty. I'm not talking about kill these criminals. They also want to kill civilians. I can help you, Michael. All these people ... they have been through hell. They don't trust anyone. But you can trust me. He has big plans for Nuremberg. But we still don't know what it is. The situation is critical. The world is in chaos but this will change the course of history. We ... we can buy land. Our own country. A safe place where Jews already they will not be persecuted or killed. Forward. You are now part of Haganana. See you in Nuremberg. NAKAM Why are you chasing him? Who are you working for? I know. He is from the Jewish brigade. They sent him to spy on us. Nobody sent me. I am not a soldier Look. You see it? Sorry, but you can't stay. - I let it go. Let it go. - Wait wait. Why did you leave the division? They left. I stayed. Please, please, look. This is ... a list of SS men. Application. Please watch. Anna saved you in the forest. Yes. You can do something I can draw a picture. Once i was studying painting. Once finished. - I'm afraid you'll have to go. - I bet you. I have no other place to go. It's okay. - You can spend the night here. - Thanks. But you have to go in the morning. MUNICH, COLOGNE, NURNBERG, HAMBURG. BERLIN. Anyone who is not prepared for heavy physical work you must go. We are looking for men and women who do not be afraid of getting your hands dirty. Anyone who is not prepared for heavy physical work you must go. We are looking for men and women who do not be afraid of getting your hands dirty. I'm not sorry. Next. Passport? - Paul Galman? - Yes. your work? Plumber. Do you have other certificates? I am a hydraulic engineer, before the war worked as a plumber. You are lying. - No. - Next. Give me a chance. - Wait a minute. - I'll call the guards. I spent five years in the service of the Reich. I have kept our race, I have purified it. They can hang me. I need this job. Please. Next. How bad is the situation? What are you looking at here? They sent it to filtration center. Access to main pipes. Do you trust him? Let it work. All the beginners follow me. Come on, hurry up. I am Willie. Pablo. I missed my job. Normal life finally has started, right? You need to restore the system city ‚Äã‚Äãwater supply. Then the whole city has access to drinking water. Let's give water back to our great nation. Go ahead, move faster. As you can see, really we need your strength. Now you see the system main filtration. The heart of the city. When we fix it, the heart will start beating again. Twenty thousand cubic meters of water will flow from here every hour. We filter the water with chlorine to kill bacteria. Then the water flows towards the houses of the village. I am with them. Seriously? Well done. - That? What is the problem? - Everything is huge, Michael. - What are you talking about? - Too. Abba's men are everywhere, there are separate groups throughout Germany. Cologne, Munich, Berlin and here in Nuremberg. This revenge is much greater. Craziness. This is the meaning of your life. You should get information. Earn the trust of Abba, he is our key. If we don't stop their wicked plans, everything will change. Forever. The world will look at us different and we won't get our country back. Do you understand this? Max, look at me. I trust you. He. The hardest part to contain our demons ... What are you writing? My brother was murdered. I protect the emptiness of my lands. This is not your fault. Yet the time will come when they will knock on the door ... New day. An incredible day. Because you didn't choose. You did not choose which it would be your sin. What did people see when they arrived for the first time to the camps? Your families. Their children. When they get off the train ... I smiled at them. My job consisted in packing. Write their names. I to them .. I said I would return the suitcases after showering. They left. Silent. After they left, I examined the bags and collected all the food I could find. We had food. That's why ... we have called the lucky ones. As if our life was rich and serene. Even though I know there is no hope I had to lie to give them hope. I have not done that ask since then. One day... not even a second. Why didnt i any? Why? Why didn't I warn them? Why didn't I tell them to run? I didn't help, I didn't help at all We will never be cattle for slaughter. It is time to teach the same lesson to everyone. I can help. Good night, Max. Do you trust him? He is like us. Never more. Never more. We all had to flee. We had to leave to our families. We ran into the forest. We fight at night. We made friends to survive the day. Abba came up with a plan. We will not wait for the court administer the alleged justice. Look at them. They saw how we expelled from schools. Of our jobs. From our houses. They rejoiced. They knew about the death camps. These people are not victims, they heard our screams. They killed our children. Then they came back home with their children. They say that some inhabitants of the city will be prosecuted. But we believe that all Germans should be tried. Thousands of years of pain will not be repeated ... Never more. Cana can. Six million to six million. I served in the military for four years, I ate this shit. The war is over, but look ... We still feed on this mess. Where did they send you? To the eastern front. To war against the Russians. And you? Where did you send? To Auschwitz. Damn Hitler. - We need it. - I have no doubt. Our cards no longer work. He. I tried to learn the field, but ... they watch me constantly. - Do you have a threesome? - No, it's my turn. Great game. You always win. - Revenge? - Let's go. I ... I will win. Mixture. We have little time. Find out where Abba is. Let's fight again. Paul, calm down. Take it easy. Come on, get up. Come on, get up, yeah, like this. Come on, help me. Yes that's how it is. Marvelous. What's wrong man? hold on. Come on, bow down, that that's all. Yes well done. Come on, wait, wait. Autumn. hold on. Get. This is tea. It is very sugary. You need energy. That is all. I made these spirits myself. Better than any tea. You join Pattern. What is the problem? The boy almost die before my eyes. Let it rest a bit. Let's go. I'm going. Thanks. The pipe needs be repaired. Find the right guys. Make a work plan. Paul, are you okay now? If everything is fine. What are you doing there? Wood. Watch out. This is the water use map. Here ... north. These are the main tunnels. If we pour the poison here ... We can't escape because this part is protected. Maybe we should think about This part is our only way out. Application. Do you really think we can kill millions of people and survive? The allies do not they will kill right there. When will it start to run the turbine? Progress is slow. - Also with main pipes. - Abba will be back soon. From where? Where is Abba now? She goes to Palestine. She couldn't find poison in Europe. Our men they will help you there. Maybe. Maybe. We are on Saturday. Not for me. Not anymore. My dreams are blurred. That is why I draw them. Can you draw for me? My son. My son dead. He was seven years old. Curly hair. He had big brown eyes. Pink cheeks. He was a good person. He had a big heart. He loved listening to music. And my bedtime stories. He had a strong character. He was stubborn. But he was physically weak. We try to escape down the sewers. In the dark for hours ... we crawl. It was too much for him, he could barely breathe. That night he rained. The water level was more higher than we thought. I have tried. But he was very weak. Do you think the pain will ever end? I hope you don't listen. This is my home. You can't put me on. We don't need you here. To go. - Let me go. - To go. They come back again. Jewry. They think they can get it all back. - Please don't touch me. - Leave. Leave him alone. - You have no right to that. - Shut. Don't attract attention. Be patient. Everyone will get what they deserve. Come on, hurry up. We are late now. They all worked hard. But we still have not finished. But today come home with your loved ones. You can be proud of yourself. Starting today, all homes will have clean water. Let's go. The heart of the city ... beats again. Live! Anna? The last time I went to the movies with my family it was a few years ago. That are beautiful. Nobody believes that surrender is imminent. Then the news arrives in Times Square. All of New York takes to the streets to celebrate the end of the war. The news of victory is greeted with joy from coast to coast. Kisses, scheduled shows. Until he accepted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpeace with the fun new power: the atomic bomb. It was the loudest celebration in the history of New York City. During the war, the Nazis they had 250 concentration camps. There were about 10 millions of military prisoners. They were killing them in various ways. - The Germans preferred gas chambers. - We should see this. More than 5 million people they died this way. But in the beginning often they starved and were tortured. But the poison gas didn't do enough damage to enemies of the Nazis. They poisoned or experienced with other inmates. Look. - Look. - Some prisoners were burned alive. The ashes were used as fertilizer and the bones were sold to salt producers. 3 million people they died in the German camps. German doctors confirmed that they carried conducted brutal experiments on thousands of prisoners. Hi dear. Anna? Nice to meet you, Mr. Kovner, I heard you came. How can we help you? I am looking for something. It is something very powerful. Something you don't have taste or smell ... And it shouldn't leave a trace. We're running out of time. When will they act? I dont know. They all come. Americans, Russians ... French.. Everyone is given a piece of Germany. They share it as a birthday cake. Our friends are losing to his patients and I can no longer hold them. We must stop them now. Where is the? I dont know. They still don't trust me. It's strange. I guess you approached the woman. You listen? Germany is not safe for Jews. It would be a shame that something terrible happened. Guys, more and more enemies come to town, our ... We know. Sit down. This is from Palestine. The wedding was postponed. We were supposed to poison them a month later, but three months passed. This letter was sent a few weeks, maybe he already took the poison. - Or died on the way. - It took too long. I'm not sure what others think the same. We have to persevere. There are too many American soldiers. How? - They say it's too late now. - Is it late now? Shut! There are Americans everywhere. Nor can we poison them. This is war. We knew there would be loss of life. They are sitting at home. Israeli children ... waiting for revenge ... We have to cut the pipes from friendly neighborhoods. We will have to go down through the tunnels. See you here in an hour. Anna. Anna? Are you okay? Are you okay? OK let's go. - Come with me. - Expect. Listen to me. Everything will be fine, take a deep breath. Too late. I can not do this, please help. I killed them all, I'm really sorry. I am very sad... Anna ... Listen to me. This is not your fault. There was nothing you could do. You couldn't do anything. We should go. Come with me. We should go. - Max. - Help me. Hug me What is wrong with him? Everything is fine, he drank a little. what's wrong with you? What are you doing in our house? - Please let him go. - A few days ago I heard a Jewish prayer. Come on, Anna, come on. Do not touch me. Sorry. I knew you were Jewish. What is this? Coal. And you? No, I couldn't. She was waiting for you. That? Opened. What does it say there? What's the matter? They came for the neighbors. We must keep everything. Come on come on come on Where is the? Do you want to shoot us? No. Wait. Listens. We have a message. - Letter from Abba. - Max. Boots. It came from Palestine. Read. - This time I will definitely kill you. He-he tried to take poison, but it didn't work. No one will help us. It's over. Sorry, Zvi. He is not trying to stop them. We are just empowering them. Do you think it will be safe here? Now... Far from here... People plow fields they plant trees, build houses ... They are starting a family. They are giving birth to children. A new generation who does not know what fear is. This is true revenge. I think you have two options ... Either I'll give you my friends, or ... Until tomorrow... Everyone will leave this city. What are you going to decide? - What is this? - This is a letter from Abba. But I gave him the old one. Honey, they gave me some money. I was able to find the medicine. I come to you my love. Our wonderful wedding was will develop as planned. What will happen now? Anna? We have come a long way. Take the train to the port, we have than meeting Abba. I'll send a telegram to the others. They need to be prepared. Max, stay here. What if they come before? All this. We will change history. Let's get this over with. Anna? What are you doing? Anna? Abba will come soon, the water will run soon, everything is ready. But I am not ready. I am going. Where? Where do I belong. Anna. What will our plan be? We will get justice. I can not do this. I can't kill children ... Enough death is enough. Come with me. Where are the others? Belkin wanted to get you. Anna. He was. Did you bring it? They are following us. We have to go, give me the bag, I know what to do. - Are you sure? - Give me your bag. - Good luck, Max. - To go. Max. Max, stop, stop. Let! Max, give me the poison. Look at me. Everything is fine. Give me the poison. If plan A had come true Not a day goes by without no think about what would happen. I keep thinking about how the poison will run through the veins of Germany ... This is the end. We have a passenger enemy, arrest him immediately. British police arrested him a few kilometers before the target. They were looking for Abba. Stop. Our men in other cities scattered when they realized that Abba was not coming. For me... I decided to go home. To live a happy life ... This was my revenge. What if I told you that they murdered your family ... Imagine for a moment ... Your brothers... Your sisters... Your mother and father ... Your children... All the world... without reason... that they killed you. Now ask yourself a question. What would you do?
