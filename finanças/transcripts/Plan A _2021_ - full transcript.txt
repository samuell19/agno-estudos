Then the news arrives in Times Square. All of New York takes to the streets to celebrate the end of the war. The news of victory is greeted with joy from coast to coast. Kisses, scheduled shows. Until he accepted the idea of ​​peace with the fun new power: the atomic bomb. It was the loudest celebration in the history of New York City. During the war, the Nazis they had 250 concentration camps. There were about 10 millions of military prisoners. They were killing them in various ways. - The Germans preferred gas chambers. - We should see this. More than 5 million people they died this way. But in the beginning often they starved and were tortured. But the poison gas didn't do enough damage to enemies of the Nazis. They poisoned or experienced with other inmates. Look. - Look. - Some prisoners were burned alive. The ashes were used as fertilizer and the bones were sold to salt producers. 3 million people they died in the German camps.

We must stop them now. Where is the? I dont know. They still don't trust me. It's strange. I guess you approached the woman. You listen? Germany is not safe for Jews. It would be a shame that something terrible happened. Guys, more and more enemies come to town, our ... We know. Sit down. This is from Palestine. The wedding was postponed. We were supposed to poison them a month later, but three months passed. This letter was sent a few weeks, maybe he already took the poison. - Or died on the way. - It took too long. I'm not sure what others think the same. We have to persevere. There are too many American soldiers. How? - They say it's too late now. - Is it late now? Shut! There are Americans everywhere. Nor can we poison them. This is war. We knew there would be loss of life. They are sitting at home. Israeli children ... waiting for revenge ... We have to cut the pipes from friendly neighborhoods. We will have to go down through the tunnels. See you here in an hour. Anna. Anna? Are you okay? Are you okay? OK let's go. - Come with me. - Expect. Listen to me.

Do you think it will be safe here? Now... Far from here... People plow fields they plant trees, build houses ... They are starting a family. They are giving birth to children. A new generation who does not know what fear is. This is true revenge. I think you have two options ... Either I'll give you my friends, or ... Until tomorrow... Everyone will leave this city. What are you going to decide? - What is this? - This is a letter from Abba. But I gave him the old one. Honey, they gave me some money. I was able to find the medicine. I come to you my love.

Give me the poison. If plan A had come true Not a day goes by without no think about what would happen. I keep thinking about how the poison will run through the veins of Germany ... This is the end. We have a passenger enemy, arrest him immediately. British police arrested him a few kilometers before the target. They were looking for Abba. Stop. Our men in other cities scattered when they realized that Abba was not coming. For me... I decided to go home. To live a happy life ... This was my revenge. What if I told you that they murdered your family ... Imagine for a moment ... Your brothers... Your sisters... Your mother and father ... Your children... All the world... without reason... that they killed you. Now ask yourself a question. What would you do?
