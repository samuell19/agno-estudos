Let's move... - B! - Yes, lnspector Chung. - Take care of him! - Okay! - Don't carry the pager. - Why? Two reasons, first. lf it beeps while you're working, the whole mission may be spoilt. - Second, avoid suspicion. - What suspicion? Using it to warn our target. Let's go. Madam, wait, wait a minute! Oh, robbery! We are not robbers. Madam, we are police. Oh, you nearly scared me to death. l thought it was the mass robbery. Can't wait to show off. - You two watch here. - Yes, Sir... Go!

Ben, l'd say it's a sure Win. Three, six! Got it! Four, eight! Got it! - Take it! - Thank you. Master! What master? Call me 'B'. Chief B, we'll have to write a report if we use the gun. We won't tell, who would know? You're afraid of everything. Now these gangs all have guns. Killing by knife is out-dated. The most updated method is burning. How to treat the burnt? You're right! Now, get you tuition fees ready. What tuition fees? Here's a lesson for you. l'm lose. Everybody don't move. For you now charged with mass gambling. Police. Open up! Don't move! All stand on one side. Take out your l.D. cards. Kit, make sure you have all 32 tiles. Why? Short of one won't make the game. How can we charge them? What are you doing here? So, you have a lot of money to gamble here. No, Chief B Please let me go. You bastard, go to hell. - ln a while, you will line up, you know? - Okay, l got it. Quick! Move quickly! Go on! - Are you shy or what? - Move quickly! Yes, Sir! One follow another. Don't play it on one. Yes, Sir! Good bye. Chief B, how could you do that? He's a suspect. You're against the law, you know? This sort of thing is only... a minor charge. l have to send a longer bait for a big fish. He is my informer. l'm being under-estimated. You think l'm that flop everyday. Give me Goose slice, cold shrimp and crab... fried oyster with egg, sea shells and 2 large beer. Shing, what a meal, must have won a fontanel. No, the gambling stall has been raided by police. l'm here to celebrate. You're so lucky not being caught? lt's not luck. Just that l've a boss behind me. So l walked freely out from there! This is treat from boss. Eat all you can. - Who is the boss? - Shing! Chief B. Please sit. l've ordered the food. We're waiting for you. So generous? You won't do anything without a purpose. What new, speak up first! Gambling, drug addicts are baby cases. l don't want them. Doesn't worth a cent. Chief B if l got arrested this time. lt would at least be 3 to 5 years imprisonment. Just speak up and don't waste time. Okay, l will speak. Here, Druggy Shing, cold shrimp, and crab. But, you're got to give me a lot more. Old boy, in the training school, we were taught. That cops are never blackmailed. Trying to bargain with me eh? l let you off just now. What about that? That's easy to work out! lllegal gambling. The most is $200 fine. Never death penalty. You do take well. Shall l punch you? Don't threaten me. That won't make me talk. So, you mean l'll have to fix you up? Chief B. l'll be straight-forward, $1,000! What? lt used to be 100 or 200. Why $1,000 now? Can't be helped. Your men arrested so many drug sellers recently. Goods are not long available. Prices go up several times. l'm not being greedy. But, it's really worth it. Stop all these nonsense with me. Do l even you any money, or give you too little? But this concerns the re-conditioned arms. Druggy Shing, Chief B. What's all these mumbling? Telling some secrets? Hope you're not telling on me! Bet you wouldn't dare! Blacky, how you scare me! l know you. You once fought with me. You must be wrong. l don't know you. Shut up. Friends! He's my new colleague. Shut up. Kid, last week at the fight in the factory area. You were the one stabbed on me with dagger, right? lf you say so! l've had over 30 fights this month, which of your eyes saw it? Chief B l'm your friend, with this of guys. l don't want to bother at all. So that's fixed. Kid, don't let me get you again, or you won't have a good time. We will have to find out. Too bad l should meet him. Spoils my appetite. Hey, we are left to ourselves now. What about your information? Tell me quickly. l don't have any appetite either. Let's walk while l tell you. Please, give me the bill. Here is $200 first. Balance be given after l got them. Thank you, Chief B. How much? Total is $95. Keep the change. - Thanks Chief B. - His treat! Why so generous. Shing? - Let's go! - Go! The guy is a worker in mechanics. His whole flat is full of books on guns. He's got a few re-conditioned guns. You don't trick me? No, l don't trick you. Where did you get guns? l bought it. lt's just a toy-gun. Why all in parts? For detail study. That illegal? You are trying to convert it into a real gun, right? Sir, that would make me... an engineer not a worker. You read so many books about guns. What, reading those books would mean converting guns. Well, the old man next door has a full house of sex magazines. So you would take it that he's sex maniac? Crazy! - Hello is this extention 37? - Yes! ls Chief B there? Yes, speaking! This is Shing, what about my $800? You bastard. With such rubbish and you want more money? Chief B. l know you're arrested him. What's the use? Just a toy-gun! No use! What? Just a toy gun? l'm sure there are more. l've been to his flat. l saw it with my own eyes. You said the gun was bought. You have the invoice? Of course l do. Kept in the book. Get it out and show me. So trouble some. Kit! When we take statements, we write down what we see, right? Yes! Now! There's something l don't want you to see. Excuse us! Hey, that is not good. No problem. Go on. Go... Hey, don't beet me. l can sue you for that. That would get me in trouble. That's not the problem. l'm in too. Just leave it to me. Go out! Don't! Don't do it. You can't beat me. l'll sue you! Oh! l will. Don't try to threaten me. You dare not shoot in here. Smart guy! l'd like some fun with you. Since you like guns. Tell me what model is this? See if you can tell! So, you want to test me! All cops use a 38 special. Did you even play with a real gun? No! Try it! Come on! Rather heavy! Oh! Help! He's beating me! Don't move! He took my gun. He took my gun! lnspector Chung! No! He just banged himself into the shell! What's the matter? l don't know. l came in and l saw him pointing the gun at B. No. No. l didn't! No? You are now pointing the gun at me. Assaulting police and grabbing his gun, that would be at least 10 years. Fire! Just fire and it will be life... imprisonment at least for you. Fire! Fire if you have me guns. Fire! You only have 6 bullets. We all have 6. Shoot if you have guns. Let see who can get over it. No. No! Sir, l don't dare. Then, you co-operate with us. l'll tell the truth. l've hidden those guns in the factory. lf you had told everything earlier, you won't be in such a mess. To handle this sort of people, no need to use violence. He may be cunning, but we are even smarter. Did that guy fire the gun? Fire? He'll be dead if he did. Last time that guy had... such a good beaten up. Why didn't you tell me earlier? You fooled me too. l'm not fooling you. l just taught you a lesson. Kit, are you tired... with that Hitler posture? Well, still upset about yesterday? Working with you is too risky. lt's either threat or punch. Kit, when l was a new hand, l was like you. As a result, l was fooled like a monkey by them. This is the right does for the right disease you know? - Right does for the right disease. - All the same. Let's go and find something. Why did you do that? This is to find something? You fool! Do we shout. They, we're police. Anything wrong? Get a seat and watch around! Go on! Oh, if only. l could win just now! l'll repay what l own you in a few days. Are you trying to borrow from loan sharks with my name? l wouldn't do a thing like that. No! You borrowed $2,000, from Loan shark Ming, with my name. Are you kidding? Kidding? Ming is going after me for the loan. Ah! - You must smooth it out yourself. - Okay How are you going to repay it? ln two days, l'll do anything to get the money to pay him. You won't be able to, even if you kill yourself. Now, there's away. lf you do it well, you don't have to repay the loan. Just tell me what to do. Boss! l'll do my very best. What is it. Boss? l have 2 men working. You'll keep watch for them. - What is it actually? - Robbery! Robbery? l can't do it. Last time. l want thru a few years in jail. This sort of things, don't count me in. l'm afraid l may ruin the whole thing. Damn it. Now that boss has told you... and you quit. Boss, don't beat me. l'll say l never hear it. Don't tell it out! He wouldn't dare! l'll have him killed. Go! you say a word and you're dead. Don't. Don't beat... Who did that to you? lt's Apache just a few punches. Blacky, lend me some money. What! Not enough fun? Yes, you do know me well. One look at you and l'll know. Hey, Crazy dog seems to have one lot of goods. Market price is $15,000 per lb. He would give me at half price. How can? You're got to try out the goods. l want you to try out for me. But remember, don't tell anyone. What is it? Shing, what is it? Shing, what happened? Hey Shing! Get up. Shing! You're been a drug addict for years. How could you take that mixture? You don't even look clearly. Lucky you're still alive. lt looked okay but not so good to take. Chief B. Did he ask you to try? Well, Druggy Shing. You must tell everything. Say it clearly! No. Not him. Sir, he said no! Are you trying to fool me? You must said Blacky asked to try it, but you deny now. Sir, there may be some other people called Blacky. Druggy Shing... Stand properly! Tell the officer... that pack from the street. You here? He picked that from the street. Don't just arrest any me. Kick that out in front of me. No, Chief B. He owed me some money for a long time. l just want to give him some trouble. lf l find out you are related with his drug. Then you'll know! Kit, let them go. Why? What can you charge them with? For having fake drugs? Or you taking fake drugs? - Then... - Then, what? They may even sue you. You addict, get lost. Sorry, you alright? Chief, you're great with these cases. lf you can take up some study, l think that may help your promotion. Study, it took me 12 years... to finish my primary school. One promotion every 2 years. Oh! Forget about that. You're just exaggerating. Kit, let's sort out where to go after work. l am having a date with my girl friend. Again it's trouble! lt's troublesome to study, to have girl friends? Why not? All are indecent women. lf l have to get along... with a real decent one, l'd rather be dead. You will never know... how it is to have a girl in your arms. Think about it! You cannot find a girlfriend. So, you wanted to jump into the sea. This is no good. That is no good. You might as well jump into the sea. Hey, let's drop these jokes. Hey, can l borrow your girl friend for a night? Don't stare at me. l just take her home to show my mother. l don't want her to urge me to get a wife everyday. No! l'll do anything for you, but not this one. Don't worry! lf l really take a girl home to my mother. She will be very happy. What a moment. - Just for once. - lmpossible. - Just help me. - No! This string is good. Save it for yourself. Kwak, l have a good pan. l have my own. l don't want you to take a few mouthful. Come on, don't be so mean. l'm not well off these days. Otherwise. l'll be so generous. Druggy Shing, why are you always taking advantage? l won't take anything from you. lt's just Kwak's. No money, use your brain. Someone told me. Crazy Wah, Kwong and Old man. Are robbing the gas station, go and see them. l know. They came to me too. lt'd be 3-5 years again if it goes wrong. l don't want to do it. Afraid of everything. Go back home. You're wasting time. Go away. Okay, don't come to me if you are hard up in future. Let's see. l don't think l'd be poor all my life. Mother, give me $10. Always asking for money. You never give me even on pay day. Your daughter does not out? Maybe she's gone to work in a ballroom. You beasts, all nonsense. No bull shits. My daughter is a decent girl. No kidding! What? - No, nothing. Get your money. - No need! That's no good. You may report me to the lCAC. Quick! Hurry up! Police! Too bad. Oh... Chief B! you scared me to death. Drugs also kill, and you're not afraid at all. No. l didn't. No? Oh! l was just smoking in here. Chief B, you're alone today. Where are your men? Would be too bad for you if my men were here. Come on, don't frighten me like that. Chief B, will you give me 100 bucks? No way, What news have you got recently? Yes, l bet you'd not be disappointed. - Don't try to cheat me! - l won't. Okay. $100. - Give me a receipt. - Okay! Hey Kit, help to clean the car. What? You want me to fail my lnspector Exam? Then l'll have to follow you and catch people all the time. Cops have to catch people, if not, might as well be a watchman. Wang, l'm starving. Anything to eat? lnspector Chung, Kwan said he's starving. Anything to eat? Wait till daybreak. lt's alright here. Look at B, lying in the car with legs up. We are so worm out. lt's our bad luck. Get in and rest a while. Get up. We have to fall in and dismiss. lnspector Chung. What is this, B! How can you explain it? lnspector Chung, l didn't anticipate this. My informer did tell me this. Look what you're done to us. l got all these mess on my body. Me and Kwan are worse. We were nearly frozen. Don't talk so much. l'm starving. Let's something to eat. You two go and get changed. Dismiss! You never benefit your friends. Chief B. You cheated me. People all put the blame on me. No. Chief B. l was looking for you the whole night. You didn't call back. l don't carry my pager while in action. What is it? lt was said the deal for gas station is too small. So they won't rent them the guns, to save trouble. Who was going to rent them the gun? l don't know. lt will get me trouble if l do. You don't know? Who will believe that? l swear, Chief B. Trust me. Believe me Chief B. Cues me if l do. Don't swear so freely. Now, what happen to them? Still want to do it. - When? - l don't know. But, l'm sure it will be during this week. Really? Yes, sure. Don't cheat me again, Or you'll die. Kit! Without anything to do, l'd go home to sleep. - How can we sleep now. - Or watch TV. That's no fun. Please be kind. l would say the same thing, why don't you go for someone else? They are either going back to their wives... or for entertainment. You know l'm having an exam. Please don't bother me. Hey Kit. Come on! Please help me! l got news, its these few days. They you can report to your superior. That day l was scolded by everyone. And l don't know the exact day.
