Train looted in Amaravati Drama troupe behind the crime, escapes with government treasure Intense hunt launched by the police Sir, please let me go! Sir Sir, I have nothing to do with this It's these guys who looted the train! Last night I fell asleep after parking my lorry at the railway station They gagged me and used my lorry to ferry the... We're not cops bandmaster We're the Abhiras! Abhira! Please let me go; I shall take my... Bandmaster, in today's proceedings, you will dance to my tunes Raise your trumpet! It must raise a toast to the verdict I will deliver today Accused No.1 in today's proceedings, is the ten-headed Ravana The greatest amongst the demons Noblest amongst mankind The verdict must be fair to both demons and mankind Bandmaster! You don't seem to be dancing to my tunes, These heads that have mastered the four Vedas can be burnt as per human customs These five heads that have mastered warfare can be buried as per demonic rites But, what do we do with this last head of Ravana? Can you see that throne? It has a history If the king who sits on it, eyes a loot, then he must own it If not, it's an insult to the throne While I was eyeing this loot, wasn't it wrong of you to steal it, Ravana? You've insulted the throne! It was a blunder. Please, forgive me, Abhira... You can forgive a man who has lost his way. But not the one who chooses the wrong path! Hey Koyla! What do we do with the last head of Ravana? Do we burn it or bury it? We are as much human as we are demons, Abhira! Okay then, I'll burn it and you bury it Fill life into your tune bandmaster, not fear If not, word will get around that Ram Ram is a tyrant! Ram Ram's name should be etched in golden letters in the annals of Abhira history along with this loot! Master, there is nothing on the top of the lorry! They have hidden the loot on the way here, master Hey, if you die without disclosing the where abouts of the loot RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JAARIPA I will slaughter your family, too!!! This is Ram Ram's vow!! RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JAARIPA We are running out of time Abhira. Please announce your successor Ugra is right. You better decide on your successor None of you are worthy of sitting on that throne Until the lost loot is found, the throne rather stay empty! The one who restores the lost glory of the throne will be its true successor The decision has been made, hasn't it? Leave now! You have gone crazy cribbing about the lost loot I am the only successor to the throne Your sole heir I have every right to that throne! Jairam, don't forget that Tukaram is also my son Your illicit relationship with the maid has yielded this dog and he can't claim the throne! Give me your hand, Tukaram This ring is a symbol of Abhira tradition And according to the same tradition, it's being handed over to one of my sons Leave! All these years, you were dispensing justice to the Abhiras from that throne But you were blind to the injustice meted out to your own son I've waited for you to show me some love for so long You held his hand throughout his life, but my rise and fall went unnoticed by you And it left me wounded I thought you'd heal them before your death, but you let me down again Who will call out on the injustice that you've done, my lord? I never held your hand and helped you walk, but with folded hands, I am seeking your promise Never ever harm Tukaram Promise me! I promise not to kill him I have always seen myself in you, Jairam My vow is now your responsibility Lord of the seven hills, the king of Abhiras is no more! I, Jairam, the legal son of Ram Ram, will be the successor to ascend this throne But, I will not ascend the throne until the lost loot has been found and the families of those robbers are destroyed! This is Jairam's vow! Until then, king Ram Ram's name shall stay with us! Long live his name! RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JAARIPA Jairam tried relentlessly. But neither did he find the loot, nor the rest of the drama troupe that went missing 15 years passed by in this pursuit To this day, none can go past that lorry This is Jairam's line of control! Dear viewers of Amaravati, Speculations were rife that the government's treasure that was looted 15 years ago, was hidden in Amaravati itself Finally, excavations are now on to recover the lost loot Despite threats from Abhira Jairam, the fearless world-famous treasure hunter Harishchandra has begun the excavation The visuals you are witnessing currently, is a historic one We wish the braveheart Mr. Harishchandra a long and healthy life and wrap this special documentary Lakshmi! - Please contact Lakshmi Studio for all special occasions What is it?

He's the one in disguise Hands Up! This is his philosophy He definitely is born to create history While I've been waiting at the station to file a complaint, you are happily downing drinks at the bar! Miss Lakshmi, It is better to drink at a bar, isn't it? Won't it be an offence to drink at the station? Gentlemen! Please respect women What do you want now? Respect? I mean, you want to file a complaint? Write it down Tell me, madam Despite knowing that treasure hunter Harishchandra has threats from Jairam, why didn't you safeguard him? Threat? Where's the threat Miss Lakshmi? It's already been taken care of! Who are they? Jairam's henchmen. They were set to kidnap the treasure hunter. By then, our inspector arrested them Madam, please revoke your complaint The treasure hunter has already been kidnapped! Really? Has he been kidnapped? Hold on! You must be confused. They were set to kidnap him, but then... It's a lie! We were following him to provide security. We are aides of the bright and promising politician Tukaram He put us on the job to safeguard Harischandra as he doesn't trust the cops Boys! One minute So you're saying that you were following the treasure hunter to provide him with security And you're saying that the treasure hunter has already been kidnapped So, Show! If the treasure hunter has been kidnapped while you were in my custody, you are not the kidnappers Congrats! Thank you Miss Lakshmi You have saved four innocents from being punished Just you wait! Please handover the handcuffs at the station on your way How irresponsible! Tomorrow's newspaper will have your entire history. Just you wait! You're threatening a police officer and according to Section 300 and... ...it's a serious offence! And you all are witness to this. I will take strict action Action will be taken against you by your department! Don't forget to read the paper tomorrow! Which paper? Hi Amaravati? - Yes. Ok, I will make a note of that Anyway, nice meeting you guys It was an amazing party. Really! Who will pay the bill? Our bill is now clear. What about yours? May I? Ah! Thank you By the way, gentlemen, if in future, if somebody writes your history, It will have two parts One: before you met him Two: after you met him Who is he? He is Sriman Narayana! Uh oh! Looks like it was a rocking party! Even I have a party It's called Shanti Priya (Lover of Peace) But until there are bullets in a gun, how can there be peace? Lovers of peace... Sir, Tukaram sir! Can I get some water to drink? Ramchandra! When a man is gripped by fear, it is normal for his throat to dry up Unfortunately, water is scarce in this town No water But that doesn't mean there's no water in our town It's there! Even our town has a lake We're not allowed to drink from it Tell me why? Sir, the cap is still on, Smart! This cap is Jairam's line of control No one can cross this line to the other side Oh it's simple! Give it to me First, request Jairam "Jairam sir, If you remove this line of control, we can easily..." Sir! Can't we drink? Jairam...make your request Sir? Make your request! Jairam sir, If you remove this line of control, we can easily drink water from this lake Jairam says, "no" One minute Oh! Jairam says, "there's a hidden loot on the other side... ...until we find the loot, I'll not tolerate anyone going near the lake" Then we have a problem sir And if we find the loot, then you will be free of Jairam and his line of control On the same line, I had roped in a treasure hunter to find the loot And deployed four men for his security But you... Sir, that was due to a confusion Even I have a confusion Those four men wearing hats inside the bar... ... do you know what their job is? They are secret contract workers No one can even find out who gave the contract! If you write a contract, put in a hundred rupees and drop it in the can it reaches the hands of Cowboy Krishna He takes it and... Damn! I seem to have missed something! One Rupee Sir, Not 100. It's actually 101 rupees And if Cowboy Krishna drops the one rupee in the cow-bank, it means the contract is on The money and the contract chit goes to the hands of the hat-wearing men Whatever be the contract, consider it done Very good! I am their old customer! Ramchandra! Shall we write? What? The contract! Sir, cap. It's yours. Put it on Treasure hunter Harischandra has been kidnapped owing to my irresponsibility If I don't rescue treasure hunter Harishchandra from the clutches of Jairam within four days, Sir, go a little slow then feel free to... mercilessly... horrendously... ..kill me I assign you this task in complete faith. Yours truly, Just put a tiny comma Below that Inspector Narayana Sir, 101 rupees? Don't worry. It's already in the envelope Ramchandra, drop it in the can, will you? You have only four days. Mind it! Let's go? By the way, no cop has ever set foot inside the fort of Abhiras Good luck. Take care! It'd have been better if you read the letter Tukaram sir! Printing is almost done. Start loading already Ok sir Breaking news! Charmed by Miss Lakshmi, the editor of 'Hi Amaravati' Mr. Sudhakar, would've praised me in his newspaper The news has been printed. But alas! The newspaper won't reach anyone Reason: The delivery van is missing Sir, can you keep it low!? To hell with you! Sir, it's my mom on the phone Now, Miss Lakshmi will come here on her Luna with Mr Sudhakar to file a complaint Hi! Amaravati Please come So.. The word is that you've written on our sir today. But the newspaper hasn't come in yet! That's why we're here to file a complaint! The entire lot of papers that were printed this morning is missing. And so is the delivery van I've been trying to reach you since morning, but your phone seems to be forever busy! ...I only managed to steal a plate and tumbler this time. Sir is using it to have lunch! Mom, hold on! Everyone's staring at me! I'll call you later Sir, first take our complaint! You might want to give a complaint Mr Sudhakar. Look, we have no problem taking it Side please! And then, you will keep pestering me to find it. But we have no motivation to find it. Do you know why? You haven't maintained a good relationship with us Take for example our neighboring aunty, she keeps sending us tea and coffee Sir, tea! We don't even have to ask for it She has maintained friendly relations with us What's aunty doing? She is taking a shower Very nice! There was a theft in aunty's house the other day. In 15 minutes we brought him here Ask him! Sir, not 15 minutes! I was here in 10. You were late. Ask madam. She was here too Madam? Now what? Will you take my complaint or not? You still haven't given it Miss Lakshmi. How can I take it? Ok. Here! Write it down Write Mom, sorry the call got cut. Like I said... Oh! This isn't mom! Oh, you found a van? Grey colour? CEZ 306? Mine mine! Grey colour! Oh.. See you merely began writing the complaint and we already found your van! Correct, Sir! Very good, Cobar! Amma, you should have been here to see my catch! This is all Narayana's ploy. Don't fall for it, Sudhakar I won't Lakshmi. No way! Mr. Sudhakar! Coming, sir! One minute Lakshmi! Sir? Love is in the air, huh? No, no sir Good. It won't work out anyway Nothing like that, sir. There's no problem What does it say Achyuthanna? Have they praised me a lot? Not bad. Lot of spelling mistakes though Isn't it wrong, Sudhakar? Sir, that... Come here Look, don't sway to the charms of Lakshmi and cheat on Saraswathi If you do that, what will happen to our relationship? It will get spoilt, sir Exactly! What do you plan to write tomorrow? Definitely not anything on you sir! Sir... You're making the same mistake again You must write We found your van even before you filed the complaint Isn't it a wonderful topic to write on? Absolutely sir It's a wonderful topic, indeed. We can write Is there a problem, Achyuthanna? Huh? No Go on then. File a report that the case has been solved Thank you, sir It's ok, Sudhakar. What columns does your paper have? We have... Is there a sports column? Yes sir I play Kho-Kho Write this 'Narayana displays incredible prowess at Kho-Kho!' That'll be nice (Struggling noises) Achyuthanna! Sir? Treasure hunter Harishchandra! What the... Sir, I've nothing to do with this Sir, Sir, this is the only vehicle that goes unchecked from this town This fellow must be conspiring with Jairam and attempting to smuggle him out of here Sir, I swear I've no clue about this I don't know how he ended up here Sir? Do one thing, Achyuthanna Book Miss Lakshmi's photo studio for one hour I will break into Jairam's fort and rescue treasure hunter Harischandra But the treasure hunter is right here Where? Where Achyuthanna? Ah! I get it! Make way Miss Lakshmi. Please! I am on my way to break into Jairam's fort 'Amaravati's braveheart Narayana' - Ready? Miss Lakshmi, smile please! Superhero breaks into the impenetrable fort of Jairam; rescues treasure hunter Harishchandra Ramchandra, why didn't I get to know of this news earlier? Tukaram wants to know Ten of Jairam's henchmen on this side And on the other side, just me! Sir, what about me? I had made you promise, isn't it? That you are old now and you will not fight anymore So yes. I kept beating them all into pulp And because he kept pulping, sir got exhausted and collapsed A man comes running with an acid bottle and sir is unable to even move I pleaded, "Sir, please let me break my promise. Please let me break my promise" The acid bottle is drawing closer, but sir isn't uttering a word Sir, "Please let me break my promise. Please let me break my promise" All right! That's enough Achyuthanna! And he said "All right!" That's when the hero of the story Achyuth Kumar made his entry I grabbed the bottle from his hand, gulped the acid and spat it on his face But if you gulp acid, won't your throat get burnt Achyuthanna? It did sir. A little. Can't you make out the change in my voice? Yes. I think I sense a slight change now Narayana Hello! The master is calling Ok go. Who's stopping you? Sir, promise me that you will not get into a fight today I will handle them No Achyuthanna. This isn't as easy as downing a bottle of acid This isn't a request. This is an order Achyuthanna? Parota! I am placing an order for parota! Get a plate of parota and mutton balls for sir Ok sir Hey Who the hell are you? Shall I tell you and then beat you up? Or beat you up and then tell you? B@$##$! Parota and mutton balls! Sir I take back my promise, you handle this Hello! If you don't mind Sir, bend down You made me bend all the way for this?? Howzzzat! I feel shy, sir Where did he go? Is it very deep? Oh it is! If master hears about this Who the hell is your master? Jairam! Checkmate! The master had summoned the inspector. So we brought him here But it looks like it's he who has brought you here! Let him in One minute In the history of Amaravati, we are the first cops to enter this fort Sir, it'll be great if we're the first ever cops to safely get out of here, too! Please spare me, master! You can forgive the one who has lost his way, but not the one who choses the wrong path! It's Abhira blood that runs in my veins. I can never be a traitor Let's check if it's truly the blood of Abhiras that runs in your veins What happened? Apparently, he who used to leak information to Tukaram Disloyal dog! Jairam! Watch your tone when you take my name Vibhasu Or else, I will have to disregard the loyalty you've shown to my father Ugra, crucify this dog Bhoppa! Get the cross Achyuthanna, I've been observing the bandmaster. He is indifferent to whatever is happening He has already lost his mind sir. So he just minds his own business Poor fellow. He's lost his marbles off late So does he not react to anything? No We have to ensure the master doesn't find out If he does, we'll be doomed Lord of the seven hills The king of Abhiras Rama Rama Long live his name! RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA Bandmaster, seems like the proceedings will never begin until you blow your trumpet You've been blowing this trumpet for 15 years now. And all of them have been rejoicing by hailing the name of my father Rama Rama Long live his name! So someone tell me, when will the name of my father be liberated from this court? Sir, you know... The fact that you haven't managed to find a single clue shows that you wastrels are habituated to rejoicing If that b@$^@$ Tukaram has dared to lay a finger on my fort... Bandmaster, I hardly felt it. You should hit a little harder I was just training him on what to do if somebody snatches his trumpet Achyuthanna, behave! Sir, I would've come there and shook hands to offer you my salutations. But I'm helpless Circumstances have tied me up The reason for summoning me here... ...is because we bravely foiled your attempt to smuggle the treasure hunter out of town Even the newspapers got carried away while singing our praises You are upset and I can understand your pain, sir But I speak only the truth as I stand here I have nothing to do with this This act of bravery was entirely by our constable Achyuthanna Achyuthanna, please! Excuse me! He got carried away by his call of duty. Please forgive him In fact, he has a lot of respect for you Isn't it Achyuthanna? Yes! Most definitely! These buffoons are claiming to have rescued the officer from our clutches So according to you, I was behind the attempt of smuggling the officer out of here Why? Achyuthanna, he's asking you, why would he do that? Who do I have to fear in this town? Exactly! Why would he fear anyone? Ugra, if this inspector continues acting smart, pump all the bullets in this room into his chest Now, bear these two things in mind One: If that officer was in my captivity, you would dare not come anywhere close, forget rescuing him Two: And had you managed to rescue him from my captivity, your corpse would be hanging on the ramparts of my fort So you didn't kidnap the treasure hunter, sir? Is your corpse hanging outside my fort? Sir, here's the truth. We didn't make any efforts to rescue the treasure hunter. We found him accidentally And since we found him, we thought we will get some fame out of it Yes sir. It brought fame, but for him Ugra, they are of no use to us Sir one minute. We will definitely be of use Sir, what is it? You want to trace the kidnapper right? Give us two days. We'll find him. Right Achyuthanna? Yes! I don't need your help for it Oh, you don't need it? Sir, I'll handover the treasure hunter to you Ugra! Oh you don't want that too? Sir!! If you give me sometime, I'll find the missing loot for you He seems to be interested! Don't assume my desire as my weakness, Narayana Sir, you've tried finding that loot for 15 years now, but the treasure hunter knows how to find it Sir, allow the treasure hunter to do his job Claiming that his life is under threat from you, I shall closely guard him As soon as we find the loot, I will hand over it to you It's the fear of death that's making you talk If you go back on your word, the consequences will be more dire than the death that you've managed to escape today Ok relax! Didn't you hear him say that I've managed to to escape from death today? Gun down! Keep an eye on him Ok, master I thought the bandmaster was pretending. But I'm really disappointed. He's totally lost it Why are you disappointed sir? Concern! The poor thing has been playing the trumpet for the Abhiras for the past 15 years And these Abhiras don't even have half the concern I have But what can they do? My father had lost his memory when he received a nasty blow on his head But when I hit him correctly on the same spot, his memory returned in a flash! How did you know it was the correct spot? It was I who hit him the first time, so that's why! There were five notes in this wallet, isn't it? We are five of us here, aren't we? Sir, unlike your father, the bandmaster didn't lose his mind due to a blow, right? It's due to a shock A shock? Of course we can give him that too! There are many techniques to do it Physical, mental and so forth... Can you see him? That's physical If you go back on your word to Jairam, then you'll meet with a similar fate Now this is mental shock Despite being police officers, we're rendered helpless. He may stay alive for maybe another three days. How sad! Anything can happen in three days, Achyuthanna Let's go Where to? To the arena Achyuthanna, this game began 15 years ago It was started by these six drama folk The ones who came to perform a play, also looted a train Desirous of the loot, but fearful of the Abhiras They hide the loot thinking they could smuggle it out once things cooled down and while on their way.... Excuse me! ...and while on their way, comes the first twist to the story The first player enters the arena Surprise! Ram Ram tried his best to find the loot. Alas! He breathed his last before doing so! But with conditions applied! This condition gave rise to two more players Jairam and Tukaram Jairam has power. He has the support of the Abhiras The whole town fears him He will stop at nothing to win this game But, he is impulsive! Doesn't think before he acts, doesn't trust anyone around him Ah! That will work in our favour! And there's Tukaram Abhiras will not let him anywhere close to them He wants to eliminate them and rule Amaravati He has built his own party to gain political strength He believes politics is the next dacoity But if neither of them has kidnapped the treasure hunter, it means a third player has entered the arena Who could that be, sir? Though the treasure hunter was kidnapped in broad daylight, Jairam and Tukaram have no clue about the kidnapper If both players are oblivious to the presence of another player in the arena... ...then he is smart, he is courageous! Think about it, Achyuthanna The kidnapping of the treasure hunter has been of no advantage to anyone Except for him Achyuthanna, If someone writes the history of Amaravati in future, it will be divided into two parts One: before his arrival in Amaravati Two: after his arrival in Amaravati Who is he? He is Sriman Narayana! Oh, I love that expression! Sir! Sir, sir How did you manage to kidnap the treasure hunter? The hat-wearing men who were sitting in Cowboy Krishna's bar Oh! I am their old customer Sir, now that you have entered the arena, how do you plan to find the missing loot? If you need to find the loot, then we need to dig, Achyuthanna But where, sir? Tell me where the six drama folk were buried? Right here! Then let's start from here Sir, if we haven't found the bodies yet, they must've decomposed Then we should've at least found the bones Looks like someone's found the bodies and made off with them What do we do now? Do as I say...get me six dead bodies. Why sir? Let the departed rest in peace Achyutanna! Today... ...the programme arranged by our beloved Amaravati Police Department... ...to find the remains of the six drama folk who lost their lives after stealing the loot and perform their final rites... ...that is just a small part of my big plan... Your problems are now my problems I've come here... ...only for you. ... only for you... I've relayed the news to the press across six neighbouring towns. But only these many have turned up How many have come is immaterial, Achyuthanna It is "who" has come and for what, that matters I'm not a coward and won't be scared by threats That man there with a towel on his head... Who's he? That's our pickpocket Velu, sir He's just doing his job! My intentions are right Hail Tukaram! Sir, he seems to have arrived just to ruin our plan Dear Harry! Inspector Narayana! Heard that you're on a mission to deliver peace to the dear departed And where there's peace, how can I not be there? Take your seat The almighty himself will descend to protect you ...will descend... On our way here, Ramchandra was telling me a few things.... ...that it wasn't Jairam who kidnapped the treasure hunter I reprimanded him "Don't you read the paper?", I said That in fact it's our Narayana who rescued the treasure hunter by breaking into Jairam's fort Achyuthanna, who is that fellow with a monkey cap? I remember seeing him around here... Go ask where he's from Sorry, you were saying something About how people spread such amusing rumours Oh yeah! Such nonsense actually! Take for example the rumours at Jairam's fort They say someone is leaking information to you from there Of course, I didn't believe it! But you know Jairam. He was interrogating someone with a vengeance! If one continues wearing a mask even after one's true colours are revealed, it becomes a mere accessory Let's straight get down to business? Ah! This is interesting. Let's talk! I only want one thing. Jairam shouldn't lay his hands on the missing loot The Abhira clan should perish without a leader And your political party should take their place in Amaravati Very good thought! I know! But according to my sources, somebody has apparently promised Jairam that they'll help him find the loot That's not a very good thought, isn't it? Now, he has to either break his promise Or I have to forego my peaceful ways and break his bones! Come on, let's burn! Clap! Come on, clap! Tukaram sir! Despite the culprit being caught, if you're getting information from the fort, either you're joking... ...or you still have some of your men there! By the way, thank you for giving me the information oh.. Miss Lakshmi, please click a picture of Tukaram and me Smile please! Sudhakar! Sir Of course, I'll write about this sir Those four men near the lorry...who are they? I've never seen them before. No idea who they are Go find out I've come here only for you I'm not a coward to be scared by threats If your intentions are right I'm sure the almighty will re-incarnate to protect you This time our calculations won't go wrong This is definitely our Sri Hari who has come to save us Sri Hari, you're finally here! But we had recovered the bones of those drama folk ages ago Why did he stage that act today? Had he not staged that act, we wouldn't have gone to that function, isn't it? He did that only to pass on the divine message that he's here to protect all of us Oh God! How kind of you to do so! Perfect timing! Tomorrow is a full-moon night Let's hope the divine message reaches us and the prophecy comes true Sri Hari, please protect us always Please relieve us from this town Sri Hari, please protect us always Finally the lord is here! 10, 20, 30... Ready or not, here I come.... Boo! Boo! Nothing can remain hidden from me in this town! Good morning security! Shall we get down to work? So you will find the missing loot using this pendulum? Yes! And what if it fails? I have one more What if this doesn't work either? I have many more I'm sure one of it will work Let's go! Achyuthanna, what are they both doing here? I had asked them to follow the four mysterious men And we arrived here by following them, sir Yes sir Mr Harishchandra, the lorry that has the loot is outside the town What are you doing in this town with the pendulum? You should ideally begin investigations near the lorry, isn't it? No We have our own plans We will search for it right here He says he will search for the loot here For weddings, thread ceremonies, death ceremonies and other special occasions, please contact Lakshmi! What's your problem? There he is... Sir, why are these guys following the treasure hunter? How can the prophecy comes true if Sri Hari continues to escape like this? If Sri Hari doesn't come on his own, then we will take him there today How? Ashu... ouch! Interesting! Gather our men... Put on your masks... With no hope of leaving, we are captured here... This has started to feel like an endless exile... Ah! There comes the full moon in all its glory And has brought with it waves of bliss Gather our men... Put on your masks... The troupe that looted the train is still in this town Yes sir They get together on full moon nights. And the rest of the time, despite being amidst us, we didn't even realise it! But I still have a few doubts, Achyuthanna I think we should join... Yeah! My dear ones, what is this new celebration? It's just an age old tragedy... We have lived a life of unfulfilled desires Give me one clue and I will solve this riddle We are bearing the brunt of someone else's fault Yes, this is absolute injustice Tell me more... No. Else we will be sinned We need you to descend, Sri Hari Once upon a time... There existed a Sri Hari Drama Company... ...with such prolific actors Actors so great... ...even if woken up from deep sleep... ...they recited the dialgoues...even if asked to recite frontwards or backwards And one day... They were summoned by Amaravati to perform 'Vishnu Purana' They vowed not to leave the town without completing their performance Not being able to perform the last part, they stayed back...but as convicts... Having lost to the ruthless Abhiras, we are forced to live in hiding We have surrendered to this art form... ...with these colourful masks... Protect us, O Sri Hari...you are our only hope... Understood, Achyuthanna? Yes Sir! Without performing their final play, these guys can't leave this town. Exactly! Sir, let's see if we can find a clue about the loot He's not one of us!!! Who the hell are you? Why are you here?Tell me. Garuda (eagle) is here! Come here! Sri Hari!! Sri Hari!! Please protect us Sri Hari, where did he go? Sri Hari! Sri Hari, henceforth, you have to protect us from Jairam Since he divine message arrived, why are you still hiding your identity from us, dear one? We have awaited your arrival for so long. Please don't make us wait any longer, Sri Hari Help us perform our final play and leave this town Shut up Achyuthanna! How did you all come here? What did you do with the treasure hunter? Don't worry. He's safe at his home, Sri Hari We got confused and mistook him to be our Sri Hari Had we known that you are the real Sri Hari, we'd have kidnapped you right at the beginning They have given us the responsibility to take you along One minute. There seems to be some confusion here There was a confusion yesterday After the prophecy came true, there is no confusion What prophecy? The one that came true yesterday! Sri Sri Guptananda swamiji had predicted a decade ago that the divine message would be delivered on a full moon night Yes, I did...Garuda (eagle) But only a part of my prediction came true The rest of it will be fulfilled by Sri Hari himself! It is his love alone that can redeem you all from your troubles Yes. My predictions can never come tru...damn! My predictions can never go wrong Are you able to get it Achyuthanna? I do. But I'm unable to believe it I know! Actually, I had told the swamiji to not reveal everything Because some things should be kept secretive But that idiot has told them everything! It's ok sir, forget it! Come here boys Dear Sri Hari, please let us perform one last play. We'll leave this town after that But before that, the second part of the prophecy has to be fulfilled Don't worry, our sir will do it all Don't worry at all! By the way, haven't your team mates shared the location of the hidden loot? No sir I'm merely enquiring, that's all... We get a salary, isn't it? I'm least interested in the loot But curiosity is a trait we all have, isn't it Achyuthanna? True Back then, these guys were all just kids Achyuthanna I don't mean to say it was exactly them They were others in their troupe, isn't it? Wouldn't they have been informed? Obviously they'd have! I'm sure they know they know it too They're just scared that's all, poor fellows! If they don't disclose it, won't they anger you, sir? I'm just scared that in your anger, you might just abandon them and go back They had made a map to guide them to the hidden loot That's all we know... That's a great idea, sir! If they have hidden the loot in an unknown place, they must have a map to guide them to that spot, isn't it? So... ...where's the map? We don't know that sir Really? None of you know it? No sir If these guys don't know And these guys are dead There is only one guy! Bandmaster! If there is any information about the map, he must have it But... ...he is crazy We can fix him! Stop, Achyuthanna! Stop testing them Sit! Sit down! Now what do we do with them? They don't know anything much, Achyuthanna We got to know there's a map, find it In the police station? What are you searching for, sir? Ah! Got it! Achyuthanna, please treat them well I'm off to shock the daylights out of someone Who, sir? The bandmaster You should leave this town! Your life is in danger Please leave the town right away Narayana I've earned only two things in this town, Miss Lakshmi One is friendship The other is love If I'm in danger, it's only because of one person Narayana, listen! I know why you staged that act of conducting the final rites of those drama folk! I'm not a fool! I didn't come there to witness your drama I've been following the activities of those drama folk for many years now Even I'm aware that they still continue to live in this town I'm not sure I follow what you're saying... You're not the only intelligent one here, listen... ...they have this superstition that some Sri Hari will arrive and rid them of their troubles And for some strange reason, they believe it's you! Why do you call it superstition, Miss Lakshmi? I mean, it's definitely possible May be. But it's that possibility that has put your life at risk There's another camp amongst that drama troupe. And they don't believe in the concept of the lord In fact, they are dangerous They had different plans. And now you are posing to be a threat to those plans by pretending to be Sri Hari I'm overwhelmed by your concern Miss Lakshmi Really, I swear! But don't worry This gun here, his name is... ...hands-up No matter how dangerous they may be, they will have to bow down before hands-up So you've decided to risk your life Alright. You'd rather know the complete truth You've witnessed only one side of the drama troupe. Not the other Come with me Where to? I didn't want anybody to know that I've been following them But now, you've got involved in this equation It's all God's wish, Miss Lakshmi! Nothing is in our hands I didn't even know that such a spot existed in this town! This place has a lot of resemblance to the Abhira fort! Where does this path lead to? You'll know soon enough Miss Lakshmi, don't you get scared of undertaking such adventures? Why should I be scared? I might be there to protect you today. But what about when I'm not around? Single girl. Don't you think it's better to have somebody with you at all times? Like your father maybe. Doesn't he get worried when you set out alone like this? My father left us and went away during my childhood Went with whom? Because even my father eloped and went away with a foreigner a long time ago! Let's focus on the task at hand now? Do you miss your father? I missed him a lot for two months Then you got used to his absence? No, then he himself returned home! Funny fellow! What about your father? He's dead I'm sorry Was he unwell? Looks like you miss him a lot No He made my family suffer And he dragged us all down with his death So yes, I don't miss him But if he was in poor health, how's it his fault, Miss Lakshmi? This way. A little further down If the body is afflicted with disease, it can be accepted But not the mind My father's biggest problem was his desires But when desire turns to greed, not only does it destroy one's own life, but also of your dear ones What did your father do for a living? He was part of a drama troupe before he got into robbery What about your family? Family doesn't always mean we have to be related by blood, Narayana I have a family much bigger than that At one point, everybody would accompany my father and perform plays in various towns My father's mistakes have forced them all to give up their identity and go into hiding Who are you? I told you a while ago Not everybody amongst the drama folk believe in that prophecy... ...and your life is in danger because of them What was the gun's name, again? Why are you standing Miss Lakshmi? Please take a seat So can you please tell me who amongst you beat me up? You b@#$%^d!!! She had a gun, isn't it? Why didn't you just tell me that you wanted to tie me up?? So Miss Lakshmi, what's new? What do you want? Tea, coffee...something to drink Nobody knew of our existence in this village How did you get to know? How did I get to know.... Actually, I was out for a walk. That's when I heard songs from the forest I thought a party was going on and wanted to join them Look at the co-incidence! Your people were rejoicing that the prophecy has come true and surrendered to me that I'm their Sri Hari! Which Sri Hari?? The rest of them may believe that rogue swamiji's fake predictions. But we are not fools You please keep quiet You should've seen that eagle sitting on my shoulder last night. It was a sight! You missed it Miss Lakshmi! Sudhakar! Oh oh oh... You are also a part of this? Nice! This eagle, too We managed to evade the eyes of everyone all this time But staying here longer means trouble for us all We want to leave without performing the final play, but the troupe will do so only if Sri Hari says it Which is why we wanted the eagle to sit on Sudhakar and make it seem like the prophecy has come true But if you plan amongst yourselves, how will it work out? The eagle should've been a part of it, too Of course he was trained. But you hit my head and wore this armlet So it sat on you instead of Sudhakar This can't be a mere co-incidence, Narayana Oh god! Please believe me Miss Lakshmi I swear on God I'm innocent I don't believe you! Ok then. If you don't believe me despite swearing on God, then I don't want to be here for a moment longer Hey you! Untie me, now! He will not disclose anything, Lakshmi. What do we do with him? First let's think on how to convince our people Until then, let him be here Hey.. Hey.. What are you doing?? I want you to faint! I'll deal with this nitiwit later. But before that... ...bandmaster... If I have to fix him... I need to convince Jairam Impossible! You can't convince him, but you can fool him. You have to play some tricks Found it! It's not easy. It's risky. If we get caught... ...this will be your fate, too Happy married life! Hey.. Please take care of the horse till I'm back If master finds out, you'll be in trouble, Soma Take care of the horse. If I don't go back on time, a wedding might get called off I have to convey an important message to Jairam sir I'll speak to the master and be back What are they both doing with your horse? I've gifted it to them Careful...old memories of my dad I told you it's old! But you're not one to gift people without expecting anything in return.... Oh come on, they're helping me too... Now please don't ask how are they helping me! You won't find anything in there today I remember what happened the last time! Even we remember what happened the last time very well! You are looting your master's close friend If Jairam gets to know.... Apparently, he's master's close friend! This hasn't ended. Remember that! Anything left? Here, take this! Leave, Ugra. Hunt them down and drag them here Until then, I'll introduce these four men to our guest Keep an eye on him Inspector Narayana! You've come at the right time! Do you know these four men? They are the ones who kidnapped the treasure hunter But they are mere puppets If you pay them, they will dance to anybody's tunes I was trying to get them to disclose the identity of their boss and you arrived Why Narayana? What happened? There's fear written all over your face. Nervousness, too That record, sir. It's making me nervous And why, may I ask? That music reminds me of my father Old memories often haunt us, sir... So what brings you here? Ah! I totally forgot! Tukaram has all the details of you crucifying his men Which means some of your men are still leaking information to him I was shocked when I got to know of it So, came over to tell you the same Ok Anything else? Sir So you came all the way to tell me just this? Anything more? Looks like you didn't get along very well with your father... I just felt that way looking at this picture, that's all Why did he make you stand behind like an outsider instead of making you sit next to him? Then we both have something in common now! My father was exactly like him He loved playing with guns He'd always keep me as a target while shooting Funny fellow! But how can one trust a gun, sir? What if one fires a shot by mistake? Even if the intent is right, if one's luck is on the wrong side, anything can happen, right? One day, the same thing happened in our house But luckily, the gun was in my hand and I was aiming at him! Poor fellow, he died! Have you ever regretted it? Why sir? Because he died at your hands... Every now and then, I do think of him After all, he's my father Just like you, memories haunt me too But don't think of me as a heartless man He's troubled me a lot He would always stand behind the door and watch my activities He liked punishing me for my mistakes But I was smart, too! I'd tip toe to the door, silently open it and there he would be! Hey, you're not my father! Master! I was standing guard at the door because you can't trust this man Were you standing guard or eavesdropping on our conversation? Why would I do that master? I don't have to answer that question The ring in your pocket will answer that My pocket? While I was getting into the fort, I saw him playing with this ring I had seen this on Tukaram's finger How did this ring come into your possession, Narsi? Master! Jairam sir, a couple of stones are missing from his ring. Who are your accomplices, Narsi? We got these from the pockets of those five men A slave who is overcome by desires, will not think twice to loot his master's own friend He's lying master! In the same way, they will not think twice to bow down before their master's enemy Why would we loot him master? Don't believe him! We found these stones when we looted a wedding the other day How did you find the stones from Tukaram's ring while looting the wedding party, Mara? Tukaram? You eat at the fort and then lick the remains off Tukaram's plate?? Please believe us. These stones were with the inspector. We found them while checking his pocket at the fort entrance A while ago, you said you looted it from the wedding party Now you're trying to frame me! That's wrong, isn't it? Who else was standing guard at the entrance? Us master I warned you that it hadn't ended. You wanted to know how they were helping me out Now you'll know But master, they weren't even guarding the post at that time! He's lying master! We didn't even move an inch from our post! We were there at all times Absolute lie! They promised to help the inspector. Please don't believe them master! Lies again! They're trying to pass on the blame to save their lives master We didn't see them taking any stones from the inspector, master Bhadra, I'm giving you one last chance to live Tell me the truth Were they all with you? What are your thoughts, bandmaster? How will Jairam deal with them? Master, Bhadra is lying! Try to recollect bandmaster... Master, this looks like a conspiracy 15 years ago, a similar situation had unfolded I have never cheated or lied to you master Please listen to me That inspector.... Ok, I'll listen to you How did Tukaram's ring come into your possession? On one side a gun-wielding Ram Ram On the other, the six drama folk who were counting their final moments The six of them were heinously murdered I've been your faithful servant for so long Why would I be disloyal and bow my head before Tukaram? That's exactly what I'm asking, Narsi. Why did you bow your head before that dog? I know that incident haunts you even today What if that incident repeats before you again? My loyalties haven't shifted master Please believe me If your loyalties are with me, then will you believe me if I say you won't die if I fire this gun? RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA Sir, if you shoot at once, how can it be a punishment? It will be liberation, sir Such traitors should be tortured every day and finally killed Vibhasu, the inspector is right Throw them into the dungeon Master! Please.... Sir, my work here is done. I'll take your leave now Narayana, even I was wondering, as said by Narsi, if all this was indeed part of a conspiracy hatched by you.... Sir, you think I'd try to deceive you? Do you know the difference between intelligence and foolishness? Intelligence has its limits But foolishness is limitless I know you have found the drama troupe that I've been in search of for the past 15 years They will all come to my fort in a few moments They will be liberated soon upon their arrival But you? I will not liberate you so soon! As per your suggestion, I will torture you everyday and kill you B@#$%^d! I should've known when he put his hand on my shoulder We can't trust that inspector. What if he's hand in glove with that Tukaram and is fooling us? If that's the case, master won't spare us tomorrow! Shut up! Thank god, master didn't suspect us Let's take one day at a time Hey! Look, we may have to live together for a few days As roommates, why fight amongst ourselves? Let's become friends Ah! Stay right there. We can shake hands from wherever we are standing Catch him! Once he gets to know they're innocent, Jairam will definitely trace the guilty! It's dangerous to stay here. I will leave right away! So will you go to Tukaram now? Yes This tunnel will lead us to the exit. Come! One minute What?? We found only four of them We can get them to disclose the whereabouts of the others This one here tried to stop us. I've dragged him here Master.... Oh! Hello! Sri Hari! Leave master alone. Or else I'll kill him! oh I don't think you're understanding the situation Achyuthanna, here! Apple! If any... Give me grapes! Please take some bananas too! Wow locally-grown bananas! If anything happens to us...your master drops dead Am I right, sir? A gun that has taken aim, doesn't need permission to be fired, Ugra What are you looking at? Don't act in haste! Our master's life is at stake. Mind it I trust you have understood the situation. Let's proceed? Try all you want, but you will not leave this fort alive today Of course I will! It's getting a little delayed. I don't understand why though! Master! Any last words, Narayana? Sir, what's your height? About seven feet? My dearest half brother!! Hello sir! You arrived at the right time! I was just thinking of you... Wishing a life of 100 years... ...for myself! Everyone lower your guns I won't count till three I called them here You have committed a huge blunder by daring to step inside the fort again, Tukaram Despite the old age, your mind is sharp as ever! Good! My brother, the ever smart man! Marvelous! Tukaram sir, both brothers are meeting again after a long time. Have a good time. I'll leave now Achyuthanna... Narayana! I was thinking... What guarantee do I have that the fire which destroyed my brother, won't do the same to me in future? Isn't it, brother? So what if I extinguish the fire itself? Just to be safe. What do you think? I think it'd be nice if you look down for a moment Lovers of peace, please maintain peace! Achyuthanna Come! Don't be in a hurry If Jairam shoots Tukaram, all of you shoot Jairam If Tukaram shoots Jairam, all of you shoot Tukaram If either of you manages to stay alive, please don't forget to inform me! I'm curious! One minute One of the guns doesn't have bullets in it Which one is it? I'm sure you'll find out! We don't like being obligated to anyone We never forget the ones who have helped us Sir Come! I had promised my father that I wouldn't kill you I never go back on my word, Tukaram Lovers of peace, congrats! The fort is ours! Achyuthanna, what did we gain by going through all that trouble? Grapes! Locally-grown bananas Apple Because I was brave enough to bring them along So it's finally proved that you are indeed our Sri Hari! If you hadn't come at the right time, that Jairam would've finished us off! Ah! God's ways are such! Now only the prophecy... Achyuthanna, can you ask them to shut up!! Another word and I'll shoot you all! RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA Achyuthanna... Coming sir RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA Every time he hears a gunshot, the bandmaster utters this line, Achyuthanna Where did he learn this line? If this line is etched in his memory before going crazy, what is its significance? Rama Rama is the leader of the Abhiras Thusu Daksha Vrutha Jaripa...sounds like ancient Kannada, sir (Achyuthanna trying to decode) Sir, tusu means little Vrutha could mean a circle THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA. Do you know what it means? No Think again Does this line feature in any of your plays? I don't think so Do you really remember the dialogues from all your plays? Of course we do. Even if you wake us up from sleep, we'll recite all our dialogues without missing a line Even if woken up from deep sleep... they could recite the dialogues frontwards and backwards What if you recite it backwards? None of us can But I've heard that some amongst our previous generation were experts at reciting these lines backwards, too Parijatha Vrukshada Suttha Mara Mara (The mighty parijatha tree is surounded by many more trees) What?? Parijatha Vrukshada Suttha Mara Mara! Play: Samudra Mathana (Churning of the Ocean) Scene 36 The Parijatha tree which emerges from the churning of the ocean is taken by Indra to be planted in his garden At sunset, the flowers on the Parijatha tree bloom its radiance pervades everywhere and sets aglow even the surrounding trees We had such a line in one of our plays, Sri Hari The final play that we want to perform, it's the same one. Samudra Mathana Final act. Final loot There is a connection between the parijatha tree and the loot, Achyuthanna The six of them haven't drawn a map to describe the location of the loot They have hidden it within the lines of their final play Achyuthanna, if we have to find the Parijatha tree.... ...we have to watch their final play Enough. Enough with this, sir! How much longer will you trouble them? Please accept that you are indeed their Sri Hari! I would have Achyuthanna But the second part of the prophecy has to be fulfilled, isn't it? Exactly! How can I accept without it being fulfilled? And what's that? What is it? No. Sri Hari is incomplete without Lakshmi If your troubles have to end with Sri Hari's help, then Sri Hari and Lakshmi should unite Which Lakshmi? Achyuthanna, we are doomed! Unless I charm her, we can't watch their final play Which Lakshmi, sir? Have you given him anything to eat? He'd have had his fill with what we gave him yesterday! Water, I want water... We have to go to Sudhakar's press in an hour.. I've asked Raghuanna to assemble everyone there What about Sudhakar? He will come there, too But I doubt our people will accept Sudhakar as Sri Hari nstead of Narayana But how will Narayana become Sri Hari without the second half of the prophecy being fulfilled? I want food... Is it biryani? That's what I ate. You'll only get idlis. If I lie that I love Sudhakar and no one else can replace him, they'll definitely have to accept him Mr Shanku, can you please wipe my tears? Why are you crying? Thank you Nothing, The affection with which you're feeding me reminds me of my father He was exactly like this. He'd feed me everyday So sad. One day, he passed away while feeding me What happened? That's a long story! He had kidnapped a police officer and was hiding him at our house You think the police department will take it lightly? Two days. That's how they long they took to find him. They came home and encountered my father Somebody seems to be thinking of you... It must be the officials from my department I've been missing since yesterday, right? So they must have started to look for me Mr Shanku, idli oh.. oh.. You all are going through so much trouble for me If I were in Sudhakar's position, I could've helped you Oh god! This chutney is so spicy! Lakshmi! I think we're making a huge mistake keeping him here It'll take long to convince our people that Sudhakar himself is Sri Hari We have no other option, Shanku If we let him go...I don't trust him one bit! But if we keep him here, it'll be a nuisance for us, too Anyway, our people have accepted him as Sri Hari. Let's use him for our plan We'll be with him anyway... We'll keep an eye on him until they all leave town Shanku, no matter how hard you try, I will not agree to this She must agree Lakshmi must agree to Narayana for our sake Garuda (eagle) has delivered the message So what if the message has been delivered? Garuda may choose to sit on someone else tomorrow! But Lakshmi is firm She's already in love with someone else We don't believe it You have no choice In a short while from now, Lakshmi will be here with her beloved! So you will believe only if you see it? She'll be here soon You will be in for a surprise! Am I too late? You're forgetting yourself, Narayana! No Miss Lakshmi. I'm in complete control Don't go back on your word Ask them to leave the town right away Of course! Oh god! Lakshmi! Come, come Slowly! One moment please! Listen up! Hey you! That's enough I'm so happy to see the joy on your faces Which is why as your very own Sri Hari, I promise you all that I will never disappoint you all Hey, tell them already... As your own Sri Hari, I hereby declare that you don't have to perform a final play to leave this town You can all leave Did you feel bad? Yes Ok then, finish the play and leave Hey you! Start the music! Narayana! Drama master, until you finish the play, we'll all live in Sudhakar's society like one big family! Poor Sudhakar has no family of his own. Yes, yes. He'll be happy, too Right Sudhakar? Alas he has descended... ...a version of the lord himself Why do you need a Ray-Ban to adorn you? A messiah... A saviour... A warrior who has arrived just for us... Show us your original form already! Should I? Narayana Narayana... Srimannarayana....Narayana Narayana...Srimannarayana...Narayana Shanka (conch), Chakra (wheel) and Gadhe (mace)... ...where have they been kept? Shanka (conch), Chakra (wheel) and Gadhe (mace)... ...where have they been kept? Let us join our palms... ...why have a doubt, let's just ask him Why the gun? Where is your mighty bow and arrow? When the vermilion adorns his forehead... ...looks like a mark of victory... A shining star, the apple of our eyes... oh,such a charmer you are! A messiah... A saviour...the whole world considers you so There is festivity at every door you enter Narayana...Srimannarayana...Narayana It's all your fault, Lakshmi Why are you blaming me? Shh...he's here Ah! Such joy...such happiness... Just take a look... Isn't their happiness that you wanted? They'll stay happy only if they're alive You've put all our lives at risk No way, Miss Lakshmi Jairam is locked up in his own fort Despite that, if you're still worried about their safety, Use this as a signal If ever your people are in trouble, help shall be on its way For the beautiful... ...Lakumi She's so cool... Naryana is so full of love Wholeheartedly, the brilliant star... ...is showering them with radiance They are now the talk of the town Let every sound become music Sir add some more weight Come on down sir! A messiah... A saviour... Lakumi's better half... Sir, please put it on! Aren't they a match made in heaven? Narayana...Srimannarayana...Lakshminarayana A perfect match! Sir the rehearsals have begun, come! The story is simple, sir... During the Satya Yuga (Age of Truth), the gods and demons churned the ocean to get elixir Indra, a most precious element called the elixir remains hidden in the ocean floor If you churn the ocean, this elixir will emerge from its depths, thus causing tremendous good to the world How do we do it? Use Mount Mandara that is to the eastern side of Mount Meru, as the churner Ask the serpent god Vasuki to be the rope All will be well Mandara Hill as the churner Vasuki as the rope See, there! Sri Hari takes on the Kurmavatar (tortoise) and lends his support to the churning Why delay? Let the churning of the ocean begin for the great good of the world When the churning began Along with the elixir Kamadhenu, Airavatha, Chandra, Lakshmi... 14 such gems emerged And one such gem was...here, this Parijatha! So if we find this tree, will we find the missing loot? Maybe...but where do we look? It's simple. Geographical similarities What do you seen on stage? Ksheera Saagra (The Mighty Ocean) There's a lake in Amaravati Mount Mandara There are seven hills in Amaravati Does that mean we have to search all the hills and the lake? No The Mandara mountain stands atop the ocean So... Sheshagiri Hill Exactly! The mighty ocean and the Mandara mountain! We'll need at least six months to find the Parijatha tree on this hill We don't have to look all over the hill, Achyuthanna Scene The parijatha tree that emerged from the churning of the ocean was planted in his royal garden by Indra That's enough Royal garden in this case means the forest So... We just have to look in the forest of this hill But Sheshagiri Hill has no forest, Sir There isn't? No Definitely not There are forests only on Kalpagiri, Vishwamale and Pushpagiri hills only We seem to be missing something, Achyuthanna Until we crack the clue, we need to keep watching the rehearsals Oh! My dearest half brother! Please come! I was waiting for you I was sad that none from my family were here to celebrate my victory But you're family, too. So I asked them to fetch you Please sit By the way, how do I look in this attire? Remember when my mother and I were unceremoniously thrown out from this fort by you? But today, you're being held captive by me in the very same fort! I am the supreme leader of this fort At least now, will you accept that I, too am an Abhira? A change of attire will not change the filthy blood that runs in your veins, Tukaram You're a wounded soldier, yet the pride is intact! Don't forget that it's Ram Ram's blood that runs in my veins, too! Ideally, I too should've been living in this fort as an Abhira amongst you! You don't and will never belong to this fort You snatched everything away from me! The respect that Abhiras held for me, my father's name...everything! I snatched only what you didn't deserve Our father trusted me more than you. And you couldn't tolerate that! Which is why you.... What my father had in you wasn't trust. It was sympathy You will face everything that I had to, Jairam! What you snatched away from my life, will be duly snatched from you too! My father had vowed to wipe out the bloodline of the drama troupe But just before he breathed his last, he made even that vow as my responsibility Tell me why? He knew that you weren't capable of shouldering that responsibility You can never become an Abhira, Tukaram! Damn! We have to wait until dusk to watch their rehearsals Sudhakar! Lakshmi? Distribute these to all Yes! Quick! Yes Listen up, everyone! We need to keep an eye on Lakshmi, sir Yes, you're rigtht Drama master! Yes? Listen to this... ...as per all your wishes, Lakshmi and I will get married We can have your show after that How's that possible? It's only after our play is staged... ...will all your responsibilities be over Until then, Lakshmi has to wait for you Why should she? How can we keep a girl waiting? Oh my! After Goddess Lakshmi emerged from the mighty ocean... didn't she wait for Lord Vishnu to finish the samudra mathana, while meditating on Meru Mountain? Are you telling me this Lakshmi has to suffer because of the other Lakshmi? Poor girl! She has to wait for me for so long! Not that long. She seems to be in a hurry to get married to you Really? Yes Listen up! She seems to be announcing it already Did you all get the pamphlet? Yes! Yes, everyone has gathered there [Title of Play: Samudra Manthana (churning of the ocean)] Don't you all worry... ...you people... Wait! What is this, Miss Lakshmi? We are having the final performance in four days? With the support from our Sri Hari, all your desires... ...are turning into reality! Go and start the preparations Miss Lakshmi, I wanted to watch the rehearsals a few more times Oh God... What do we do? These people are already preparing for the show They'll get busy in putting up the set and props You're making a mistake Look there... ...just once... Such joy...such happiness Isn't that what you wanted? Wait! Don't get be happy as yet I still haven't given my consent for the show Wait! Disappointed? Then I'm sure he'll give us his consent Your beloved Sri Hari has vowed never to disappoint you Long live Sri Hari! Very good Sudhakar! Oh! Is my dear brother still asleep? Don't wake him up! Poor fellow, he's in pain Let him rest Ramchandra! Someone amongst you should be gracious enough to liberate him from this pain And Tukaram will liberate you from this prison Gadipar I need you to do something for me Bandmaster, do you want to keep the moustache or shave it? Please tell us Ask him the right way and he'll tell you Just clean his ears with a feather and he'll answer without missing a beat I had such a good impression about Miss Lakshmi All gone now! Sir, how are we to find the clues without being able to watch the rehearsals? Ouch! Didn't I tell you he won't miss a beat? We can' t ignore the similarities between Mount Mandara and Sheshagiri Hill If there is a Parijatha tree, it has to be in a forest, but there is no forest on Sheshagiri Hill Maybe... The gem we are looking for isn't the parijatha tree... it must be one of the other 14 gems. You look so good! See... You were punished all these years for a crime that you didn't commit We are all responsible for your situation We can't replace all that you have lost But for as long as you stay with us, we promise to look after you From now on, there won't be a single sour note in your life, I promise Please play something for us Did you get the trumpet fixed, Miss Lakshmi? I have nothing to do with this It's these guys who looted the train Bandmaster... We're all your friends, bandmaster Don't be scared Watch out, you moron! Lorry! Give the lorry back to me! I'll be on my way Of course you can go But before that, tell me on which hill the loot is hidden The creeper... Don't worry Creeper..? I will trace the loot Nothing can remain hidden from me The guns have been arranged, Ugra But we don't have sufficient men to rescue our leader Arrange for some more men The bandmaster threw sand in my face and ran away! Don't worry We're searching for him I am as concerned about him as you I'm sure. But your concern is for a whole different reason Sorry! We searched your room without your permission What is this, Narayana? The sketch seems to have faded I can't seem to make out what is on it Lakshmi! ohh.. Is this your sketch Miss Lakshmi? Enough with your drama!! This is a sketch of the Goddess Lakshmi on the coins that are amongst the missing loot We know that you're doing all this only to get your hands on that loot You're playing with our emotions for your own selfish motives, right? I don't think you're the right person to talk about playing with emotions, Miss Lakshmi Didn't you have plans to fool your people into believing that Sudhakar himself was Sri Hari? But I did that to save their lives Not for my selfish motives! You did this to compensate for your father's mistake Isn't that your selfishness? Had the loot been taken out of Amaravati on that day, your people would've been leading a life of luxury None of you would have felt it was wrong Right and wrong are merely perceptions, Miss Lakshmi It depends on each one's point of view If you look at it from my perspective, my desire isn't wrong, too There's a Narayana and a Ravana within all of us My father kept playing Ravana in all his plays and finally chose to be one himself You are committing the same mistake When the evil within you is destroyed and the good comes out, you will realise the difference between right and wrong Lakshmi! This is a sketch of the Goddess Lakshmi on the coins that are amongst the missing loot Your game is up, Narayana. Leave Don't ever show us your face again Are we searching for the wrong gem amongst the 14 gems? After emerging from the depths of the ocean, didn't Lakshmi meditate on Mount Meru awaiting the arrival of Sri Hari and Vishnu? Mount Meru.... Use Mount Mandara that is to the eastern side of Mount Meru, as the churner To the east of Mount Meru stands Mount Mandara... That means... To the east of Mandara is...Meru The hills of Kalpagiri, Vishwamale and Pushpagiri are the only ones that have forests Lakshmi, there's no need to listen to him anymore You're right You don't have to listen to me anymore Cage them all in a room Take them away I'll personally carry Miss Lakshmi Someone please open the door! Open! How did you get here!!! I don't know Lakshmi! I only remember going to sleep last night When we woke up this morning, we were locked in here! Untie me! I haven't seen Sri Hari since morning! It is your Sri Hari himself who has locked us up in here! Then I'm sure he has plan behind it Then stay right here We very well know what your Sri Hari's plan.... I have something to tell you all.... Where should we find the tree in this forest? Lakshmi sat in meditation under a tree. There will be a mark They haven't any left marks on any tree Sir, there are many trees here How do we single out the tree we want without a single clue? Which tree would you have selected Achyuthanna? Probably, the tallest tree, sir But they all look the same height Then probably one with the broadest trunk Basically, you'd have selected a unique tree So whichever tree you think is unique should lead us to the loot Creeper... Rather than mark trees, I think they've planted creepers This is the only tree with a creeper, I'm digging here... Despite your plan, whom did the eagle finally sit on instead of Sudhakar? On Narayana. Don't you think it's God's will? Yes, yes! If he was indeed the real Sri Hari, he should've charmed our Lakshmi by now. He hasn't! Lakshmi! I knew he was upto no good! Don't worry I've made all arrangements for your safety Don't worry. The guns are for your protection Hey! What are you doing!! Why are you dragging them away? Don't take unnecessary trouble Narayana. The situation is beyond your control now. But there's no harm in trying, isn't it Gadipar? Hey you! Go and inform Tukaram. Leave now! Master, we've dragged the drama folks to the fort I'm probably the first leader to set his own fort on fire on the day of ascending the throne! Where are you going? Lakshmi.... Move it! Make all the arrangements Who is that? Go check who that is Ok sir! You all carry on This fort has to burn in to ashes When shall we light it up let's wait for the orders It is better to kill one and save ourselves than all of us being killed to save one He is our leader! Deceiving him is like deceiving the throne! I was loyal to the throne all these years. What did I get in return?? He chose to believe an outsider and was ready to kill us! Why should I be loyal to such a man? Narsi! Right now we should only focus on escaping from here We've traced a way out Vibhasu. If we bow our heads before Tukaram, at least our lives will be spared Listen up! Don't you dare raise your hand on him again. I will not spare you! Will you just shut up Achyuthanna! Every time you say that, he hits me even more! I won't spare you guys! Load the chest to the jeep. Tukaram will be waiting for us I'm curious, can we take a look inside? If Tukaram finds out, he will set us on fire along with the Abhiras and the drama troupe Your drama troupe friends are already in Tukaram's captivity None of them will be alive by dawn Tukaram will not find out. So what's the harm in taking a look at it? Whatever it is, hurry up! That chest is only filled with stones. Where's the loot Narayana? Hang the constable from the nearest tree and come to the fort! I'll go and inform Tukaram Don't bury him!! Stop!!! Anybody here at all?? Drink! I know you're all scared. But, there are two paths ahead of you One: being loyal to me Two: begging Tukaram for your survival Drink up! Drink up! Master! My lifelong dream will finally come true tonight, Ramchandra Henceforth, the Abhira fort will.... You have promised our father that you won't kill me, Jairam Who said I would kill you? Meeting you after ages, Gadipar. Excuse our poor hospitality Master is waiting for you Gadipar! We found the chest master, but it was filled with stones Bandmaster! No. I've seen the chest filled with precious loot If the loot that was there is missing now, then someone must've taken it It was your drama troupe friends who looted and hid it. So, someone amongst you has stolen it. Who is it? If you don't reveal who that is, I'll skin you alive and make buntings out of it and tie it all over Amaravati! Where's the loot? I don't know! Damn! Went through so much trouble and all I find is an empty chest! My poor father must be relentlessly searching for me.... Oh god! Narayana stop! Oxygen, oxygen! If you struggle too much, there won't be much oxygen left! Take a deep breath Not so much! You need oxygen for later, too! What's this fragrance? Such a lovely smell! Flower So sad. Must've bloomed minutes ago. But is already returned to dust It's life, too has lost meaning. Just like mine Oh wait...there is meaning... If it has bloomed in the night... Parijatha! RAMA RAMA THUSU DAKSHA VRUTHA JARIPA PARIJATHA VRUKSHADA SUTTHA MARA MARA (The mighty parijatha tree is surrounded by many more trees) At sunset, the flowers on the parijatha tree bloom and its radiance pervades everywhere and sets aglow even the surrounding trees Where's the loot? Tell me! The loot is safe where it was hidden, Jairam I'll take you to it. But only after my people leave this town Narayana, oxygen!! So near yet so far! Damn this loot! I'm dying with an unfulfilled dream You're thinking of the loot in your last moments? Achyuthanna is dying because of you Lakshmi and the drama troupe are dying in the fort And consumed by greed for the loot, you're dying in here You know why? Tell me! Due to my greed Exactly! What did Lakshmi tell you about the Ravana and the Narayana residing in you? Repent at least before you die! I am Awaken the Narayana in you! I am Narayana oxygen!! To hell with oxygen! I'll need it only if I stay alive, right? Will you just shut up! I have you the signal a long time ago and you arrive now! Sir, please come out. - We came a long time ago We arrived when they were beating you up Then what were you waiting for? For him to die? We were only obligated to save his life We're even now Where are you off to? To Tukaram's fort Jairam has already reclaimed his fort Then Jairam sir will be upset if I go empty handed to congratulate him If you go to the fort in your current state, you'll be dead meat! I have escaped from the jaws of death and emerged alive I guess my life's purpose isn't fulfilled yet I will not die today There will be no exceptions... ...when he doesn't wait for an invite to join the war Only a war cry will be heard The earth quivers with his entry - We don't like being obligated to anyone He will show no mercy - Jairam's is pending... When evil soars high in this world May the fire in you ignite The evils will be vanquished... ...because he was born to make history Let's get started? A rebirth just for the betterment of this world Let only truth triumph There is a... ...battle within... The evils will be vanquished... ...because he was born to make history Narayana...Srimannarayana... Narayana, please set me free Of course! Narayana? I had promised my father to destroy your families And Abhiras never go back on their word The ones who looted that train have been long dead And none of these people are even remotely connected to that loot, Jaiaram Do you want that loot or you do you want to keep your word? The choice is yours And what if I don't want to? There's no need for all this, Lakshmi. As long as we have Sri Hari, he can't lay a finger on us! Sri Hari! Where is your so called Sri Hari?? Only I know where the loot is hidden. If you even lay a finger on them, you'll have to forget that loot forever Hello brother! There's a parcel for you!

And in place of the loot, give me the drama troupe Give and take What do you have to say, huh? You may have brought the loot, Narayana. But, you are putting your life at stake now Sir, please keep quiet, will you? I know that you will not go back on your word and give me these drama folk But, they have given no such word, isn't it? So, yes, the market is open. And if there are any interesting candidates, please raise your hand! There! The first candidate is ready! Second candidate! Good! You seem like an interesting candidate, please come forward What's your name?

Oh my! I am the man who killed my own father for the throne! Now tell me, how many amongst you desire to become the king! Not one among them dares to even think of it, Narayana Ok then Since none of you are displaying the courage to do so, I myself will sit on that throne I will use their dead bodies as a stairway to the throne Now call upon your Sri Hari! Call him! Lord of the seven hills! King of the Abhiras I, Jairam, the legitmate heir of Rama Rama Will be fulfilling the vow given to my father... Sir, there is someone... Sir, you mentioned that nobody dared to become the king,isn't it... There is someone Gentlemen, if anybody writes the history of the Abhiras, it will be divided into two parts One: before he became the king of the Abhiras Two: after he became the king of the Abhiras Who is he? He is Sriman Narayana! Narayana! Jairam sir, patience please! As per the rule laid by you, I've ascended the throne only after finding the loot Actually, after I become the king of the Abhiras, there will not be much to write about the Abhiras There will only be a full stop Tell me why? Because the history of Abhiras ends today Henceforth, it is not necessary for you to follow the Abhira tradition This is your king Sriman Narayana's first and last order Look, your fort is on fire and is getting burnt! Within minutes, this place will be on fire, too You all have families, so please have some concern about them Do not disobey your king's orders, leave right now!

There you are! Hurry up! Quick Move along! He saved all of us and.... Not just us, Achyuthanna He saved the whole of Amaravati Why did you save him? That's because the Narayana within me has woken up, Lakshmi I didn't have the heart to leave him behind (Sri Hari Drama Company Presents - Samudra Manthana) Lakshmi! Narayana! Sri Hari, by your grace, the nectar has been obtained by the Gods Now, if Lakshmi and Narayana wed, it will do good to the whole world What do you think, Sudhakar? About what?
