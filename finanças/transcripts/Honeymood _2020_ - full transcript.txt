HONEYMOOD I can't believe it... So classy! Are you sure it's ours? -Should I double check? -No way! It's perfect! I love you. I love you too. -I'm so glad it's over. -And that it was perfect. -How do I take it off? -You need a professional for that. It's like I'm in "Gone with the wind". I got myself a bride with a built-in dress? Poor you... -Oh, no! -What's wrong? -We must enter the room again. -Why? All the way to the bed! From the top! Still not good enough? Stop it... I have the card. It was black, right? What's this? "To Noam from Renana" No, that's not it. Let's go down to the reception. -What is it, then? -A check. Why did she put it in your pocket and not in the gift box? -I guess she didn't find it. -She didn't find it? It's not just a check, there's something bumpy in there. -Loone... -I'm just curious. Who goes to a wedding and writes only one name on the envelope? Wait a second. We said we'd open the presents at home. Just this one! And my dad asked that we made a list of all checks... In an Excel sheet, I know. He told me that. I just can't get over her moody look during the Chuppah. Why did she stand in the front row? -Oh Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov... -Thank you. I didn't even see where she stood. Come on, she smiled at you and you smiled back. You know you're imagining things. But the things I imagine always turn out to be true. Okay, I know, but I'm telling you this time, you really are imagining things. Here, ask the concierge. Good evening! How may I help you? We got locked out of our room. Room 902. Of course. I'll provide you with a new card. -Thank you. -You're welcome. You're all smiles. I didn't smile. You're imagining things. -Give it here. -Hands off. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience. Don't worry. It happens to all the couples. What happens to all couples? They go out of the room only to get back in, with the groom carrying the bride. Then, they lock themselves out. No, we just went out for... another reason. -In that case, I apologize. -Thank you. May I add, your royal suite was built as part of a very complex architectural restoration. Did you know that? It was a rare collaboration between the Muslim Council, Jewish contractors and a Turkish architect. Many distinguished international guests stayed in your suite. For example, Ranj Kapur. the greatest berimbau player in the world, and Mara Audo, the legendary snake hypnotist from Mumbai. He was here with 6 of his snakes. So the snakes were also in our room? Of course. They all stood on your romantic balcony and enjoyed the view of the Holy City. All bullshit aside, the air here is great. That's why we got married? So we could speak like a couple of senior citizens and say: "The air here is great"? What's wrong with that? Never talk about the weather with anyone other than your grandmother. -It's a total cock-block. -Ok. I didn't know that. In fact, that's not true. I once knew this military meteorologist, she was quite hot... Are you not going to open her envelope? What envelope? I hate it when you play dumb. You're a terrible actor. Let's just drop it, I beg you. You could have just not invite her to the wedding. -You also invited your ex. -Only to piss you off. But I don't care that he came. -I didn't even see him. -You didn't see him talking to her? That's what's eating you? That our exes talked a bit? A bit? They talked for two hours. Good for them. Who cares? Everyone was dancing but they just stood there, flirting. Like they're all alone. That's why you did that thing? With the... pole? -What thing? -That little dance you did... -Since when do you dance like that? -Did I embarrass you? No, no. -Didn't you like my dance? -You danced really nice. Would you rather I just stood there? Like her? If I wanted you to be like her I would have married her. -But I married you! -So why won't you open the envelope? We agreed we wouldn't spend our wedding night opening checks and presents. Not all of them! I couldn't open your dress and that doesn't bother you. All you care about is this fucking envelope! -I don't care about the envelope. -Yeah, right. Why you won't open it, that's what I care about. -And find suspicious. -Suspicious? It's probably just a check and a little chunk of hash. -So let's smoke it. -Let's smoke it? Yes. Since when do you smoke? "Since when do you dance, since when do you smoke..." Sometimes I wish I could do stuff without being asked since when I've been doing them. And I wish you stopped being so obsessive and annoying! Why must we fight now that this nightmare is finally over? -Now that this... -This night is finally over. Listen, I just had an insight. I know what we need to do now. -Sleep? -Get married. Get up. Get up, Nonny. Look here. -This is what I do with my students. -Is this spiel really necessary? We re-enact moments in life we want to amend. And it works wonders. Come on. Are we in class now? We missed the moment because of all the stress. So let's do it again. Just the two of us. -Do you have any Advil? -Maybe in my purse. But first say: "With this ring I thee wed. "If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill," "may my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you..." And break the glass. Why waste a perfectly good glass? Drink this, Loone, so you won't have a headache. Do you want to open it? Go ahead. You open it. It says "To Noam". -360 Shekels... -What about the thingy? She remembered I liked compasses. I used to collect those. Where's your phone? Is it "Renana cell" or "Renana other"? -What are you doing? -I'm calling her. -What will you say? -Why won't she answer? -Stop it. -Hello! Hi, Renana. Thanks for coming to our wedding. Thanks for the check and the recycled envelope. I just want to ask you, why did you give my husband a ring? It's not a ring, it's a compass! I'd appreciate it if you came by tonight and took the ring back. It's not a ring, it's a compass. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... -Relax. -Are you okay? Yes. It didn't record shit. It didn't even dial. Did you hurt yourself? It's that ring. You cannot receive a ring from another woman on your wedding. So I'll give it back, okay? I agreed to invite her to our wedding, I didn't say a word about her creepy paintings in our place or that she never came by to pick up her shit. I've been living in her junk yard for a year now, And despite what people think of me, I'm a patient person. I'm very compassionate. But that ring is too much. Come on. Come! I'll flush it down the toilet. No! Call her and tell her to come and take it back. -It's 1:30 am. -I'm sure she's still up. 30 minutes ago she was still chatting with Michael. High on life. It's dialing. What were they yacking about? Stop snatching things from my hand. Unavailable. Bingo! What did I tell you? How do you open it? Are you kidding me? Let me do it. It's stuck. It's broken. Where are you taking it to? -To her. -To Renana? Do you want to join me or wait here? Neither. Where to, good people? To Even Sapir village. I got passengers, chief. Special ones, a bride and groom. Congratulations. Talk to me later. So, she lives in a village? Yes, outside Jerusalem. It's a long drive. Traffic is light now. We'll be there in 10 minutes. Why would she live in a village? She's staying at her sister's. It's temporary. We shouldn't go there. They have a baby. -They'll think we're crazy. -I don't care what anybody thinks. I thought you didn't either. I care a great deal, and so do you. Pardon me, groom, sorry to interrupt... -Would you be so kind and bless me? -Bless you? You know a groom is like a Rabbi, and his blessing has power up there. You don't say. Sure. What, like, what should I ask for? My son, Yakir, is 8 years old. He's been waiting for liver transplant for over a year now. We pray for a donor, so he can get his life back Instead of going in and out of hospitals. -Amen and amen. -Amen. -I also prayed, in my heart. -Amen to that. Thank you, good people, Mazel Tov. God bless you. Some people have real problems. We gained some perspective. Yes. Look at us. Everything's good. We're lucky. Let's tell him to take us back to the hotel. People having real problems doesn't make me feel... lucky. In fact, it makes me feel even worse. How so? Why? Because they at least know why they feel bad and what would make them feel better And I, who just came back from my perfect wedding, still want to jump off a cliff and disappear I'm really doomed. Thank you. We'll be back in a minute. Is this the house? Enough. They're asleep. Let's go. Don't they have a doorbell? Maybe it's not eco-friendly... -Hi! -Hi. This is Ya'ara, Renana's sister. Wow, you look just like her. It's uncanny. -Are you twins? -Yes. I'm Eleanor, by the way. Nice to meet you. -How are you? -Fine. -Mazel tov. -Thank you. How's... -Is Renana home? -I didn't hear her come in. -She's not back yet. -She didn't come home? -What's wrong? -Nothing. -She was at your wedding, right? -Yes. She just didn't... And the wedding is over? Like, obviously. I'll call her. Oh, she forgot her cell phone. Shit. Where is she? She's probably on her way. Sorry for waking you up. What's up? Renana didn't come home from the wedding. -And what are they doing here? -Hello. We just wanted to talk to her. I mean, to give her back something she forgot. -What did she forget? -I'm worried. -She's not back from the wedding. - Why did she go there at all? Cut it out. Should we call the police? I'm sure she's on her way. -Maybe she finally found an apartment. -Stop it! I'm so worried. I know where she is. She met a guy at our wedding and she's with him now. Trust me, I know this guy very well. -Maybe you have his number? -Come on, she's not a child. -So what? -So she met a guy, what's the big deal? Give her some space. Maybe it'll be a proper man for a change. Okay, we'll get going. Sorry. If you hear anything you'll let me know? I'm sure everything is alright. -Sorry we woke you up. -All the best. -Bye. Mazel tov. -She's so sweet. Get inside, come on! -Why did you even open the door? -Say what? They could have invited us in, offered us a drink... I wonder why people who live in the village go to bed so early. 2 a.m. is not early. I didn't mean now. In general. Back to the hotel, right? -No. -Yes. Yes or no? -We didn't give her back the ring. We tried. She wasn't home. -To Bak'a neighborhood, please. -You can't be serious. Sorry for the hassle. We'll go back to the hotel. Right or left? Make up your minds. Does it make sense to you that we give up just because we couldn't find her in the first place we looked? And going to your ex to find my ex on our wedding night does make sense? If you put it like this, it does sound weird, I can't stand either of them. Then why are we looking for them? We're looking for HER, so that our marriage doesn't start with a curse. Stop being so superstitious! -Israel, can you hear me? -Yes. The hospital called and said to be there ASAP. -They found a donor. -Really? I'm getting Yakir dressed and ready to go. -Come quickly, ok? -I'll be there in a minute. You can wait outside, I'm on my way. I'm sorry. I'll drop you off here, okay? -Sure, good luck. -Thank you. God bless you. -How much do I owe you? -Nothing. It's on me. Just get off. -The hotel is right here! -No, it's not. -Are you arguing with me? -Bak'a is definitely nearer. -I did combat navigation! -Whatever. -Do you want to see a map? -I don't have a map. Maybe take out your little compass? -Here, look. -Excuse me. -Sir. Excuse me! -Yes. Could you tell me which is closer, Bak'a or the corner of King David and Agron? -Where do you need to go? -We need to know what's closer. -Did you get lost? -Not at all. We're locals. -Do you need a ride? -No, thanks. We have a bet going. -What did you bet on? -What did we bet on? -Nothing. -Nothing. She's right, then. Always tell the wife "you're right." -Yes. -Good night. Thank you. Shukran. Did you hear what he said? He has no idea what or who he's talking about. Listen, the air is really great. Let's walk. -To the hotel? -To Michael's house. -I am willing to walk to the hotel. -"The hotel!" Would you just drop all these quirks and obsessions? Be reasonable. You see, that's why all my dreams go down the drain, because people keep telling me to be reasonable, to give up my quirks and obsessions. That's precisely how I became a drama teacher instead of an actress. What's that got to do with anything? Let's go to his place, give her the ring and get this over with. -Please, it's important to me. -Enough, Loone. I'm sorry you feel this way, but this thing blew out of proportion, and we're going back to the hotel. You want to walk? We'll walk. You want a taxi? Here's one. Hey! Here, here! Thank you pal. What are you doing? What are you doing?! Everything's fine. Can you back up a little and just drive around us? It's okay, we're good here. -What's wrong with her? -She's just being a drama queen. Are you okay? Do you need help? -Hey pal, it's a private matter. -You're the one who stopped me. -My mistake. Drive on. -Should I call an ambulance? -Everything's fine. I swear. -I'll call the police. Get up already! What are you, a baby? -We'll go to his place? -We'll go wherever you want. There, that's his room. The one with the light. Wait here. -Yuck! Gross. -What? What do you want? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? It's Michael's room. -He asked me to install a software. -Where is he? -Who? -"Who"? Michael! -He's not home? -I think he went to a wedding. I am the wedding! He went to my wedding. -You two got married? -Yes, Nitzan, we got married. You actually think I'd marry that douchebag? So what do you want with him? -Tell me if you know where he is. -Probably in the editing room. I'd call him, but then he'll ask me to go there and stuff... Close the window next time you install a software. I'm really installing a software, it's Java. Did you get his idiot roommate? I hate his guts. Let's decide that from now on we love everyone. Why should we? Let's get a taxi and I'll tell you. Why a taxi? It's right here. Forget it. We're practically there. He said he was editing. Which means he's not with Renana, and it's her we're looking for, right? She's there, watching his film. That's his signature move. It's his idea of a date. Tomorrow, if it's still crucial, we'll find out where everyone was. But I know they're at the film school, real close. Our only mistake was not going there to begin with. I'm going back to the hotel, babe. Bye-bye. Are you treating me like a child? No, like a grown woman who throws a tantrum when she doesn't get her way. Noam! The iRobot! I'll keep it here. Do you know how much that hotel suite cost my dad? It's one of the most expensive hotels in the country. So that means we're not allowed to leave it? No, but instead of enjoying our great suite, you're dragging us on a hike all around the city... -That's what you love about me. -That you're crazy? How did you put it? That life with me is always an adventure. I prefer a different kind of adventure. Sounds like you prefer expensive hotel rooms. It has nothing to do with money. Look at this surreal situation. We'll remember this story for the rest of our lives. I'll remember the Second Lebanon War for the rest of my life, too. I'm not looking for stories, I want to get back to the hotel. I just love touching you... Tell me how much you love it. We'll give her back the ring, and go straight in the Jacuzzi... I'll go in first, and wait for you, all naked... Then you'll come in and... -Listen... hey, hey! -Listen. Are you listening? -Yes. -The film school is our last stop. -Last stop. If we don't find her there, we're calling off the search. You're sweet and I love you. I wish someone stapled us together. Hey! Hey, Michael! What's up? How's it going, dude? Are you alone here? -Sadly, yes. -So nobody's in there with you? -That's a sore spot. -Why? Netta doesn't want to be my editor anymore... so I'm editing by myself, like a dog. You must be wondering what we're doing here. We just... Actually, you're a Godsend, I can't believe you're here, it's like a dream come true. I almost brought my laptop to the wedding. I need feedback. -I'm not sure if it's cool with Noam... -What's that? -Michael wants us to watch his film. -It's a short. Tomorrow's my last presentation and I'm about to jump off the roof. What presentation? It's a bunch of assholes with sticks up their butts criticizing my film and deciding its fate. Please, please, please. Come in, watch it, react to it. I'm all alone here. Okay, I don't want to over-explain before we watch it. Basically, this is my thesis film. He's been working on it for two years. Three and a half, but who's counting. They made 'Apocalypse Now' in seven, so I'm still good. We'll start with the 29-minute version. -How many versions are there? -Two. 28 MINUTES LATER Why is it freezing in here? Because it protects the computer. What do you think? -Michael, it's amazing. -For real? Noam, right? Noam... What did you think? I have to write down some notes before I forget. I'll go get a pen and paper. Wow... it's a very... Political film. Very... Poignant and... -I can't find the right words. -Forget labels. What did you feel? Were you scared? Was I scared... Yes, that too... It's all about the personal story. Politics is just the background. The friendship between the Bedouin boy and the Israeli soldier, is the heart of the film. Don't they worship you? What did they tell you? That I should cut it 10 minutes shorter. They're going to slaughter me tomorrow. They're gonna bury my film. I'm a dead man walking. Okay, I'm leaving. I'm a jackass, I didn't even offer you coffee. -I'm outta here, it's fine. -Where to? I'm making myself a coffee. Anybody want any? Yes! No sugar. Thanks. Call it an adventure, call it surreal but this isn't how I imagined my wedding night. The night's still young. What about your promise? To wait for me in the jacuzzi? -We'll still get to do all that stuff. -So let's get out of here! I can't stay here another minute! -I have a better idea. -No, you don't. -Don't you want to hear it first? -No. You go back to the hotel, I'll watch his second version real quick, give him a couple of notes, and hop on a taxi. I'll be there before you know it. -I don't know what to say. -You've got nothing to worry about. I'm not worried I just think it's super weird. How can I not help a person who was so close to me? I don't have any feelings for him, by the way, except pity. We did our mitzvah for the day, for a boy without a liver. You blessed that taxi driver, now is my turn to do a good deed. This has sugar. I said no sugar. Oh, shit. Why didn't you say so? We ran out of milk. What did you and Renana talk about? Noam's ex. At the wedding... Oh, her. Weird chick, new-agey. -She wouldn't stop nagging me. -Stop it, she's not that bad. But it's you I couldn't take my eyes off. You're so hot in this dress. -Show me. -What? -How do you open it? -Stop it. Did they stitch it on you? What did you do? Didn't you see "Once Upon a Time in the West"? Where Charles Bronson was spinning Claudia Cardinale? It's a rental! It costs thousands of Shekels! You moron! -Let me see. -You're so fucked up. -I'm such an idiot... -No, no, no. Don't hate me now. I mean it. Can't you see I'm living a nightmare? Let me see. I can fix it. Do you love him? Your groom? Can you call me a taxi? I don't have my phone. Answer me first. It's impossible not to love him. He's perfect. But if your heart longs for a fucked up, self-centered, lying megalomaniac, what does it mean? That it's true love? or not? A fascinating thought. Philosophical, even. -Get over yourself. -Why should I? What can I get you? Pita bread? Falafel? Eggplant? -I'll have falafel, please. -Yes. Noam? What are you doing here, my little baby boy? -What are you two doing here? -What else, baby boy? My poor baby, you're hungry. You didn't eat anything at the wedding. -That's it. Just the falafel. -Don't eat this junk. They just showed on TV how the oil in these places is truck and aircraft oil. Here, Ma'am. One of the top ten falafels in the country. -You want this here or to go? -You're not eating here! -There's tons of wedding leftovers. -How much is it, bro? I didn't even see you. Mom insisted: "It's Noam, stop!" I told her it couldn't be you. Because why would you be here? Where is Eleanor? In the hotel. -Well? -Well what? How's the room? -Beautiful. -So why isn't she happy? Who said she wasn't happy? She's very happy. She just sent him for some falafel, right? She didn't send me. I'm a little hungry, that's all. Nothing's wrong with it. Mom always sends me off on errands. Why are you still up, and driving around? I'm only the driver. -Are you following me? -Are you crazy? Tzipi was supposed to stay over till tomorrow but then she realized she forgot her meds. -She can't fall asleep without them. -She can't sleep. So we said: let's take her home. No traffic, smooth sailing. It was awesome. Empty roads are awesome. See how nice. Tzipi took them. You swipe like this, see? Look how cute you are here. -This is how you swipe. -I know how to use a phone. -Better than us, that's for sure. -Take me back to the hotel. -You have to eat something. -I'm not hungry anymore. -What did you eat today? -He wants to go back to the hotel. I want you to drop me off here. Stop the car, Dad! Bon appetit. Enough with the salt, taste it first. Wait a bit, it's hot. -You can take off your jacket. -I know that. -What did you two fight about? -We didn't fight. So how's the room? Tell us. It's the best one. Guaranteed. -I want to talk to her. -To Eleanor? Forget it. When Clinton came to Israel, that's where he stayed. -I'll call her mother, then. -Don't call anyone. -Just go to bed. -The UN secretary, too. -If memory serves. -You don't say. -That really is prestigious. -And you know who else? Mom, what's Renana's photo doing here? It's been there for ages. -Renana and I broke up. -Really? -Tell me something I don't know. -So why isn't there a photo of Eleanor? -Now I'll add one from the wedding. -But when will you take this one down? Excuse me, you're in it too, and you're smiling for a change. -But we're broken up. It's over. -So what? Your nanas are up there too and they're dead. Do I have to take them down because "it's over"? It's not the same. And photos of you and your brother as kids, of me when I was young, that's over, too. Do you know why I'm smiling here? I'm stoned. It's not that I'm happy. We were in a middle of a fight. All couples fight. But look at you now. All this drama on your wedding night, kicked out of your hotel room. Nobody kicked me out. So what happened? What happened? How did you find me? How come you passed right by the falafel stand? -We were on our way home. -It's out of your way! -He's giving us the third degree. -So us passing by there is strange. -But you wandering the streets isn't? -I wasn't wandering the streets. I was getting myself a falafel! Dad wanted to see the hotel from outside. Okay? He's proud that he got you a room in such a hotel. Dad's a big softy! Why are you tearing the photo? -I'll make filters out of it. -Give it to me. This behavior is unacceptable! Go to your room! I'm okay, nothing happened. I'm going back to the hotel, right after I score a three-pointer... Look at this lovely clip Tzipi prepared and just sent me. Here. I'll print this one and stick it up there. Take a look. -How do you get out of this thing? -Press Escape. Noam and Eleanor Here's some food for Eleanor, too. There's tons of leftovers from the wedding. Mom, please go to bed. Everything's fine. I got this. Don't you and Dad worry. -Are you going back to the hotel? -Yes. -Dad will take you. -No need. Mom would kill me if she knew I told you, that your breakup with Renana was very hard on her. Really? I had no idea... What did you think, that we didn't get attached? That it was easy for us to break up with Renana after 4 years? To get used to a new girl? A professional actress... Enough with this actress thing! She's just a high school drama teacher! You're a cranky kid, but other than that, nice and quiet. You know what they say: If you're into drama, buy a ticket to the theater. I'm sick of you talking about her like that. When your mom and I met, we knew we were right for each other, But we didn't fall in love. Now, all those who felt butterflies got divorced. No exception. But your mother and I have been together for 33 years, and we almost never fight. I know it doesn't sound romantic, but a partner has to be right for you. That's basic. -Dad, this conversation is absurd. -Because you're already married? Because I have to live my life the way I think is right, not the way you think I should. Don't you agree? Absolutely. Bye Daddy, thanks. Who loves ya? -Please don't. -Who loves ya? 5 letters. Mommy. -Who else? Da... -...ddy. -Well? -He went inside. -Is she there, the spoiled brat? -I don't know. I didn't go in. My poor baby. She's tormenting him, the terrorist. Why don't you get some sleep? How could I? I'm an emotional wreck. -Is there a problem? -Sir, are you waiting for someone? Yes, my son and daughter in law are staying in the presidential suite. -Royal, tell him it's the royal suite. -Congratulations! But I must ask you to move the car. Why? Who is he bothering? Here's my son. I'll just pick him up and we'll go. Noam! Noam! Ruthie, try to get some sleep. -Ok, keep me posted. Why won't you go home, Dad? You forgot to take the food. -She's not in the hotel? -I told you I got this. -Maybe she went back to your place. -Maybe she did. Let's go, then. I'll take you. It's close by. What did I tell you? There is light in the window. Okay, bye. Renana? I've been putting it off for so long, and when I heard your dad talking about that hotel, I figured now's a good time to get it over with. -These are mine, remember? -Yeah, sure. I wish you'd have told me. I would have brought a pickup truck. -What are you doing here, anyway? -I live here. You know, we almost threw it all out. I thought you'd never come pick it up. And I thought we were on a break and that I'd be moving back in here. I knew she'd be trouble the second I saw her. -She has a hold on him. -Maybe she's a bit more dominant... She has a grip on him. Trust me on this, Shmuel. She really is up there. I was right yet again. Don't go anywhere before you make sure he's okay. As far as I'm concerned, I'm sleeping here tonight. Oh, here's Noamiko. -So, was she there? -Yes. Thanks, Dad. -Are you going home? -Absolutely. Let me drive you two back to the hotel. -No. There's no need. -It's no hassle, you know that. We have to be alone, just the two of us. Sure. How will you get back to the hotel, then? Bicycle. It's a pity you won't get to enjoy the room. -We will enjoy it. -Your apartment won't go anywhere. Good night, Dad! Tell Mom everything's fine. Who loves ya? I'm really sorry. I didn't think it would be such a big deal. But she knows the story behind the ring, right? She doesn't know? So what does she think? That I gave you a ring for your wedding? Just like that? What was I supposed to tell her? That you proposed to me with it, that we were about to get married, that you said we should take a break, then I suddenly got an invitation to your wedding via text message. I thought you knew all about it, becasue you were getting regular updates at Shabbat dinners. I had coffee with your parents, once. Yes, it was on Shabbat. I'm sorry. Really, I am. I fell in love with her. You'll get bored with her, too. The odds are against it, I'm afraid. So I guess you're boring her. -How will you carry all this stuff? -I'll manage. How? You think I didn't figure out what's going on here? You have a runaway bride. I saw her eyes wandering everywhere. She ran away and you're incapable of spending one second alone. Her eyes weren't wandering, she was looking at you and at her ex. You guys drove her nuts. That one? Michael? What a douche. Disgusting! He went on and on about weddings, how they're always lame, and all look the same... What an idiot! I told him, that maybe it's hard for him to see her marrying someone else and realizing it's over between them. -Roll us another joint? -So what did he tell me? "Nothing's over yet. I know I'll fuck her again". And then he laughed... I recommended Ya'ara's therapist to him. -She does energy cleansing. -You showed him. Good evening. Evening? It's the middle of the night. May I ask what you're doing in this compound? What compound? The Prime Minister's residence. I'm just an innocent passer-by. You've been walking in circles for the past 20 minutes. May I ask what's your destination? Well, I'm on my way to the Waldorf Astoria. I have a luxurious suite there. The royal one. -Okay. Do you need directions? -No, I know the way. I'm just pulling myself together. My feet are killing me. Can you imagine how long I spent on my feet today? No, ma'am. As you can see, I'm coming from my own wedding. You must dance at your wedding. It's so demanding. And after all that, we crossed the entire city, my groom and I. May I ask where is your groom now? You may ask anything. You're so polite. He's waiting for me at the hotel. Would you like to sit down for a few minutes? I'd love to, thanks. Cobra 5, is there a problem? All clear, over. You may know my groom. He also was a bodyguard. -But that was 6 or 7 years ago. -No, I wouldn't know him, then. Being a bodyguard really suits him, because he's so responsible. You feel safe when you're with him. He has a black belt in karate. -And he's a perfect gentleman. -Hello. Hi there. Do you have any idea what kind of assholes live in this city? What? Egocentric, lying motherfuckers, who think that they fucking own the world! And I got myself a good guy! Kind, modest, honest, reliable... If someone up there divided everyone into couples God, or the government, or the city council, or whatever... If they divided all of humanity into couples and I got my groom I'd be so lucky, I'd say thank God! -So what's your problem? -That no one divided us into couples! That I had to make this choice on my own. You're all so handsome, like in a dream. You're salt of the earth, too, right? Served in combat units? Don't be modest. I would have married each and every one of you right now. -Where did she come from? -Runaway bride. It's either crazy people or demonstrators... -You all guard the Prime Minister? -Pretty much. -Are they home now? -No. All of you are watching over an empty house? Where are they? Come on, don't be like that. Tell me something juicy. What's really going on there? Are any of the rumors true? In our line of work, you see a lot but you keep your mouth shut. A personal bodyguard is like air and has to remember... that he didn't see what he saw, and must not say a word. Very nice. -Are you all so discreet? -Yes. -I respect men with integrity. -Thank you. And what do you do when you're not guarding the Prime Minister's house? -We're students. -Of... -Law. -Medicine. -Computer science. -Economics. -Business. -International relations. I'm impressed. Serious guys. -And we have a sense of humor. -Do you have any hobbies? We like to read books, watch movies, travel, cook, go to the theater, watch sunrises, sunsets... I never get to meet guys like you and all bunched together like that. I'll be completely honest with you: it's hard to choose. Hi, we're in the middle of a viewing. -Let's start over. -Let's not, bro, we're in a flow. -Let's rewind one minute. -Where is she? Eleanor? She's not with you? -Call her. -She left her phone in the hotel. It sucks how dependent we are on those devices, eh? Hey man! I'm telling you she's not with me! Tell me where and when she left. I get your frustration, but it has nothing to do with me. I'm in the middle of something, so... adios, amigo. If you ever come near us again, I'll tear you a new asshole! -Nitzan! -I'm calling the police. If I see you again, or hear your theories about weddings and life I'll kill you. You hear me? I'll kill you! Not again... Michael, I'm exhausted, I've been up since 10 am. I wanna go home. And you will never, ever, fuck her! Or say that word about my wife! It's not my fault you married a certified nymphomaniac. What do you think happened here an hour ago? Movie night? Hey! What are you doing? Hello? Ma'am! Nurse! Go away! Do you need help? I can't even kill myself... -What a failure, I'm nothing... -Wait! Wait! -Can I come up? -Go away! Talk to me and I'll go. Okay? Do I look like I'm in the mood for a conversation? Yes. I don't believe you're really gonna kill yourself. Why else would you do it out here? For someone to see and save you. I'm doing it here so they'll find me quickly, wise-ass. Wanna help? call the police to report you've found a body. -But why? -I deserve to die. No way. -I made a mistake. -We all make mistakes. -Some mistakes mustn't be made. -What mistake? Someone died in an accident and donated his organs and I... I ruined them. I got them mixed up. -What organs? -A liver and a heart. I put them in the wrong refrigerators. They were transported to the wrong hospitals where people were waiting for a transplant. One of them was a little boy. But what... what good will it do if you died? -Other people will get my organs! -Wait! In the movies, when someone is about to jump off a bridge there's always a stranger who convinces them that life's worth living. You don't have to convince me. I know life's worth living! But if someone dies because of me, someone else deserves to live instead of me. Got it? I will live! I will live. I always did what I was told. I never failed a test, never got punished. I've been learning Karate since second grade and today I got in a fight for the first time, I swear. Since I was 16, I've always had a steady girlfriend and then I got married. I was always dragging behind someone and became just like them. I'm 30 years old and I've never felt alive. Please, I'm begging you. I promise you I'll live. Not instead of you, but thanks to you. Okay? Hey, Teach? Oshri, you scared me! Sorry, Teach. I'm just psyched to see you here. Look who's here! Come, come, Teach. -That dress is on point! -Thank you, thank you. Don't you have school tomorrow? We're celebrating Yali's new driver's license. -You already had the wedding? -Yes, today. Now. I mean, it's over... Congrats! So now's the after-party. Sounds of mirth, sounds of elation, Voice of a bride and voice of a groom. Wait, wait, what are you doing here, Teach? I went for a breath of fresh air next to our hotel. -Sit with us a bit? -Yes, yes, please... Actually, my feet are killing me. I really miss my cell phone. Want us to take you back to the hotel? -How? A piggy-back ride? -With Yali's Dad's car. Don't worry, Yali swore he wouldn't drink. Want to come to the party with us? -Okay, here's to Teach! -Don't call me Teach here. -To Teach Eleanor, then. -Cheers! Mazel Tov, Eleanor... the Teach. -Was it fun at the wedding? -Yes, it was beautiful. We were shocked you were getting married. Why? Because you're unique, like, an anarchist. And we thought You had a crush on Yali... I'm kidding... How did you meet your husband? -We were roommates. -Seriously? He had just broken up with his ex and I broke up with mine. -So he's like your chapter 2? -No... I had boyfriends before him. I'm 32. Chapter 9 maybe. -More like chapter 69... -I rented a room in his apartment. -Is he a drama teacher too? -No, he's a graphic designer. -We just saw him. -It wasn't him. -Who did you see? -Him. He was with some blond. -Oshri, you moron, it wasn't him. -Swear it wasn't him. -How do you even know him? -From your Facebook. -Don't worry, you're hotter than her. -Cut it out, asswipe! Maybe you could give me that ride after all? -But first, tequilas all around! -Cheers! You're the opposite of all the women I've been with before. "Before"? Are you with me now? If you'll have me. If you're not with someone else. -There is no one else anymore. -Who was that someone else? A doctor. Married. Liar. Took away the beautiful years of my life. He didn't take your beautiful years. Your beautiful years are right now. And you are beautiful now. Renana, how are you? -I'm Ya'ara, Renana's sister. -It's uncanny. Yes, there's a resemblance... I thought, how much she accomplished since I last saw her. I'm Noam's father. I see you have some space in your car. -Can you help us move stuff? -Sure. No problem. -Shahar! We can use their trunk. -Sure. -Is Noam upstairs? -No. -When did he go? -We came here about... -How long have we been here? -At least 2 hours. We came about 20 minutes ago and he wasn't here. Ruthie will kill me. Thanks. More paintings? Hey, Shmuel! -Renana! -How are you? I'm looking for Noam. He was here a while ago. -I think he went back to the hotel. -Yes. -You're a really good driver. -Thanks. -I passed the first test. -Good for you. The tester said, it seems like I've been driving for years. -That I'm totally mature for my age. -Well, we already know that. -You're coming to the party, right? -It's inappropriate, I'm your teacher. But you're the drama teacher, it's not like a real teacher... -It'll be so cool if you came. -Pretty please... Eleanor! Eleanor! What's up? Is everything okay? Are you asking as a teacher? We're not in school. Excuse me? What do you want with him? -With who? -Yali. He could be your son. -My son? -Just ignore her. -Ignore me. Like he does. -You asked me to do it. -Do what? -Yali's not allowed to drive alone. In the 6 months after you get your driver's license, you're supposed to drive accompanied by an adult. That's why you wanted me to come with you? To be the accompanying adult? A friend of ours was caught driving alone, and lost his license. Just so you know, we were against it. It was Oshri's idea. It's not funny! It's sad! You bunch of miscreants! You have no respect, zero values! When I think that you're going to be our future, our country's future, I'm really worried. What are you laughing about? Stop laughing! I'm not your friend, do you hear me?! Miscreants! Why so serious? Want another hit? We're not together. We're not walking together. You go your pace and I'll go mine. What does a girl have to do not to get harassed? This is what a woman who's not interested in you looks like, okay? Married, wearing a ring, in a wedding dress. Are you a rapist? No offense, but if a woman is looking at you in the street at night, she's not interested in you. She's afraid of you. Excuse me, can you pull over, please? Get away from me! They'll think we're together! Must be fun being a weirdo, huh? You can do whatever you like. I always have to adjust myself to the world, to behave properly, smile, return phone calls, get married, say please and thank you. Go fuck yourself, you fucking weirdo! Jerusalem Syndrome my ass. Excuse me! Can you pull over? Hello! Oh, you're picking him up? How are you? Can I come with you? I'm his friend. Can I come with you? I'll get off at city center, the hotel area. What? -How about that? -Gorgeous! It's very high up. Lots of view. What would you like to drink? I'm a guest here. I'm a guest of the hotel! I'm staying in room 902! He remembers me. You remember, right? -May I see some ID please? -My purse is in the room. Don't you remember me? Where's the room card? In the room. My husband is waiting for me there. -What's the name again? -Eleanor. -I need your approval for the entry... -What's the deal? Noam! Noam, tell them to let me come up! He won't let me up? -No problem, sir. -Let me speak to him. Good night. Why did you hang up? I'm his wife! Don't you remember me from before? You told us about the battles between the Muslim council and the Jews. And the Turks. And the snakes. I'm sorry to hear that's what you got from the story. So you do remember me. Don't worry. It happens to all the couples. What happens to all the couples? They get married, and after a while, the husband doesn't want to see his wife anymore. Good night, ma'am. Noam! Noam! Noam! What the fuck? Let me up! Who's that? Who is she? -None of your business. -None of my business?! All this drama doesn't work for me anymore. No more drama from now on. You know, when we just started dating, people who knew you said you were one of a kind. Now I understand why. You're an exceptionally insufferable woman. -You're not perfect either! -You're self-centered. You're a complete nutjob, you're mental! Everybody told me, "he's a keeper, quiet, cool, considerate". -And it's not cute! -"He's perfect for you". It's not cute at all! No one knows how hotheaded, hysterical and moody you are. I'm a quiet guy! A little cranky, but nice and quiet. Okay, so let me up and we'll talk quietly. Now you'll see what it feels like to be embarrassed all the time. I'm sorry, Noam, we never should have left the hotel. We never should have gotten married. I didn't want that kind of wedding, I told you a thousand times. -I didn't have fun either. -It was a nightmare! I hate dancing! I hate people looking at me! And the guests were horribly dressed. So plain, right? As if they came straight from work. I proposed to Renana with the compass ring. -Why didn't you tell me? -Why did I find the ring at Michael's? -Don't change the subject! -What happened there? Who's up there with you? Noam! How's the room? We're giving Renana a ride home. I just wanted to see you were alright! -Why wouldn't I be alright? -He's just fine. You didn't answer any of our calls. We were worried. I'm glad you're here. Wait. Renana, here's your ring. Eleanor wanted you to have it back. I'm sorry I fell in love with Eleanor. Eleanor, it didn't work out between us either. Here's your ring. I'm going to bed with no rings and no compasses. Noam, come down here immediately! Oh, Dad, you wanted to know how much everyone gave? Wait here. There you go... Beats an Excel sheet, doesn't it? Stop acting like a child! Noam! Noam! -Where are you taking her? -To "Hadassah" hospital. Can you take her to "Shaare Zedek"? She works there. Yeah, right. She's a surgical nurse, a transplant coordinator. Surgical nurse my ass. She's a mental patient. She keeps running away and coming back through the ER. Don't worry, we know her. She used to be a nurse but not anymore. -Are you sure? -That's how she is, a sad soul. God created those too. She'll be fine, it's not her first time. Were you in the room with the injured woman? -Yes. -We were looking for you. -What's your connection to her? -An acquaintance. Who is she? Where did you find her? Excuse me, ma'am, I'm interrogating him. So am I. We'll have to get your statement at the station. -Me too. -Are you two together? -No. -Yes. -Yes? -No? Yes or no? -Yes. -No. Hand. -What is this? -Go to the squad car. What did we do? -Shaul, report to the station. -But what did we do? We're guests of the hotel. Excuse me... excuse me? Can you take these off? -Why did you cuff them? -They were making a scene. Can you hold this? You won't be needing these anymore. -We didn't need them at all. -Because you got married. Get it? It's a joke. See how the night people are gone, and all the ordinary people are up. -We're ordinary too. -I'm not... I'm not used to being ordinary. You'll get used to it. Are we going to stay together? Yes. For the time being? Or forever? For the time being, we'll stay together forever. Subtitling: FAST TITLES MEDIA
