May I smoke? Normally not. I've never done this before. And you? Do you do this often? Yes. Never with the same person? Isn't that risky? No, um. Less risky. No exceptions? No. It wouldn't work for me. What's your name? Bye. If you want to find me: "makefucknotkill". Hey. Shall we go to my place? Hey, I don't feel like Listen... Everyone going home already? Was that your hand? Oh, shit! Yeah, leave! - Yes, we're leaving. You have to go to work, at 9. Fuck, shit. Dance! Go home. Fuck off! Hey. Where are you? Here. You're so inconsistent. Bigna! Do you join us for the aperitif? No thanks. The same rules. You don't touch me. Close your eyes. Come. Please! Look at me. The contrast between control and fear, that it can go wrong... It turns me on. Once, I had to beat up one of them. Already packed? - Of course. Another question? After that it's my turn. Show me your breasts? Um... Let's leave. Can we pay? Did I say I'd pay? You said you're inviting me. I am. But I'll do it this way: We'll go outside for a smoke. Then we'll just piss off, OK? Not at all. I've no dough to pay this shit. You have no dough? You said you're inviting me. Who gives a shit. You'll be gone tomorrow. What's that got to do with it? You really have no money? None. Let's go smoke. I don't know what to say, sorry. I'll leave my sweater here as a sacrifice. Let's go smoke? Are we finally going to make love? Bigna. What do you want in Chile? Stay here. - What for? To keep up the game? Sorry. We could be more than this. You're confusing sex with love. He doesn't like to watch TV. He doesn't like to watch TV. He doesn't like to watch TV. He doesn't like to watch TV. He reads a book every week. He reads a book every week. Hi. What do you want from me? I wanted to see you. I think I've fallen in love with you. Hi. The early morning earthquake scared many. Measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, it was Switzerland's strongest in 6 years. Want some too? Thanks. Do we have any milk? Thanks. It's not good anymore. Black. I've got to warn you, OK? What about? About Frankie. He can be a dumb cluck at times. See? Finished. Mind if I piss in the water? Are you out of your mind? Hello. - Hello. Do you think one automatically becomes like this? - Jogger? Look. Here. I wanna find out who owns this. With this view... Why do you want to find out who owns this? Damn beautiful. What do you want a house for? We could go anywhere. I'm fed up with people. I like it here, I relax. I have other priorities in my life, than a house. That's OK. I think both of us like to be free. That you stayed here... Did you do that for me or also for yourself? For both of us. So we'd have time. How much do we have? - What do you mean? How long? Stop it. Forever. Forever is a long time. What's on your mind? Things I'd like to do. Sorry. Thanks? You have the bar shift tonight. Can you do that? - I'm coming. Sorry. Yes? Is Frank there? No. Want to leave a message? No, I just wanted to say hi. Is he at the club? No. Bye. Frank? Drunk? Want to go home? Do you want to marry me? Hell, no. Hey! What's your problem? We all do what we want. Hey... - Right? That's not how we are... Conventional. Aren't we? Go fuck her! Stop it! So prove it... And fuck her. Why do you give her fucking MDMA? No thanks. Mind if I pee in the water? Want some? Cocaine. So great we met you. Come too! I want you to sleep with her. I tried to analyze some of the data during the flight, but I didn't finish. We can do that later. I hope you're hungry. Very much. Thanks. And how do you like the apartment? Super - A bit empty. I'm so curious. The speaking face is superordinate to the speaking mouth. It's almost the same. - Yeah. I had a voice message. They asked me if I wanted to lecture next term. As...? As a lecturer. - Yes, of course. But on what? On natural disaster management through animal behavior monitoring. Wonderful! Yes. If I don't hear from Japan, I'll do it. Can you turn the music up? Louder, louder, louder! Here. It is remarkable that the person we love the most is the one we can least describe. We simply love that person. Those are the words of Max Frisch. And you two just love each other, with no ifs or buts. Camilla, Stefano. Are you willing to fully accept and follow your partner anywhere? Perhaps without logic. But certainly always with your heart. Yes. - Yes. I'll get us some prosecco. - Fine. Excuse me? Hi. - Hi. Are you visiting? - Yes. No. Well... And what about you? Thanks. And you are...? Georg Huber, this lady's husband. What? This lady's husband... Is that a game? Bigna? Come, the photo shoot. Come! - Coming! Frank, please. Bye. Thaks? Bigna, I... Hey! Fuck. Yes. Vonnegut Street 20, ground floor. A person's not reacting. Yes, I've done that. Pulse is weak. Please come. Wake up. I'm here, I'm here. With pleasure. A cold platter and a mineral water. Bye! Hold me. What's wrong? I haven't had my period for 5 weeks. Are you sure? Wow. Are you sure? Yes. How often do I have to tell you? Morning Trudy, Gwendolyn! What's up? Look, you'll like this. Come out. Always hiding. Are you stressed? Let's see if there are eggs. Do you feel sick? I'm not sure if I want that. Bye! Rocco! Rocco! We should give him a bell. Did you water the plant? Not yet. It'll die before winter. No, I don't think so. Give me a smoke? - No way. Think I'd have imagined that? But that's how it is. It just doesn't feel right. It will, at some point. Get out of your head. We are here. Feel it. Yes. I'm afraid that... The kind of relationship we're having... There's no space for it. Wait! Is that what you want? Do it. Stop it! It's ridiculous. Want an egg too? Are you deciding this on your own? Molinari, Bigna. I need a date for... an abortion. About 5 weeks. Today, 16:30. Thank you. Bye. Rocco, come! Rocco, come back! Hello. I booked for Molinari. For 1 night, right? Could you iron this till tomorrow? Bring it as quickly as possible, no matter how late. Hi. Hi. How are you? And yourself? Thanks. Hi Rocco. I don't remember you liked him so much. And you are...? Max. And I'm a ghost. A ghost? Yeah, sure. A job interview, as a prof. And I have a room in Kyoto. Wow. We go home this way. This way. This way in the other direction. Is Bigna coming for dinner? Bigna's got to go home too. Just for dinner. - She hasn't got time. I'm just visiting. Would you like to join us for dinner? We'd be happy to have you. Frank's got the biggest one. No, you! No! Once I caught him kissing himself in a mirror. That was a private moment. - Yes, very. I was still in the belly then. Yes, you were. There's still spaghetti. Like some more? - No thanks. No, but it was very good. What's the matter? Are you a ghost? No. I'm not a ghost. Look. It's really true. Ghosts are cold. Jump out of the window and bye-bye! Max, time for bed. I think so too. Jump out of the window and bye-bye! No, Daddy! - It's my turn today. And? Do you sometimes think... We... Sorry. It's OK, I'll do it. I'm happy to do it. I have to catch the train. Give Frank and Max my regards. Sure. I'll drive you to the station. OK? He's asleep. No, it's OK, thanks. Thanks for everything. There's no bus anymore. Bye. See you in a moment. Come see me? Hotel Q, Room 609. What am I doing? Yes, Molinari. I need to change rooms at once. What, impossible? Fuck. Ms. Molinari? Here you are. - Thank you. Subtitles: CINETYP Translated by: D. Cameron, I. Garnier
