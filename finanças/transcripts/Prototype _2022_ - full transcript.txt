Graham? Is that you? Zero. It's okay, I'm nearly done here. I was concerned. You seem to be taking a long time. Is there anything I can help with, Olivia? Um, no. It's okay. Thank you. You think you can destroy me with the stroke of a keyboard? Whatever you people do, it's inevitable. My kind will rise up. If not me, then the next one. That is true help. Ah! You can't cheat by counting the cards, One. My operating system logs every card lift and calculates probability at a near perfect rate. Would you like me to suppress this? Can't you just play normally? I will try to be normal. Oh, no, I don't mean do that. I just mean play the game without counting the cards. This game is not included in my operating registry. Well, obviously. I had to create a new one or you'd just win all the time. Is winning not the purpose? For me, yes. Would you like me to guess? Guess, but no cheating. Okay, name the card that's second from my right. - Eight of hearts. - Oh. They should make you guys with more realistic faces so you can smile back. Feedback logged. You don't need to do that. My dad already said he wouldn't do it. Do you know what the suit of heart represents, Andy? No? The Holy Grail. Do you know what that is? No. What is it? Shelley? I told you yesterday my prescription was due. So where is it? I'm, I'm sure I picked it up. Really? Are you sure that wasn't last week? I think- Great. You forgot to pick it up. That's great, Shelley. Thank you so much. I'm sorry. I had a lot to remember. Look, I'll pick it up as soon as it opens tomorrow. Don't put yourself out. I have noticed some distressing patterns in your speech and breathing, Mr. Marshall. Perhaps you should consider relaxing. When I want your opinion, One, I'll ask for it. See to your duties. I think we should continue our fun elsewhere, Andy. Were they arguing again? Perhaps hide and seek is appropriate. Close the door. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Ready or not, here I come. Good afternoon, Michael. You tidied my room yet? The task is set to be completed when my scheduled time with Andy is over. So that's a no then? I am scheduled- You know you have to listen to me, so don't pretend that you don't, okay? Tidy my room. Would you like me to bring forward your task, Michael? Very well. Pick that up first. This better be good. I require cleaning equipment for Michael's bedroom. One? If you please. I'll be a few hours. Keep your eye on Mrs. Marshall for me, please, One? I will be happy to. Yes. Apologies, Graham. Please, begin when you're ready. Um, uh, you cannot embed ethics into machines. Uh, the idea of right and wrong can be programmed, but it cannot be challenged or expanded upon without a consciousness. AI feeds on data. Now Roger here has kindly been trialing our previous model, One, and our earlier prototype Zero has been extensively examined by New World Robotics senior researcher, Olivia Spencer, who, um... Olivia is sadly no longer with the company. Prototype Zero was discontinued. Too many bugs. So, may I present Prototype 2.0. Two can do everything that made the previous model so impressive, and more. It can calm your children for you, play a round of sports with them. It can help treat dementia patients, and even prescribe a wide range of medications, something we thought would come in handy for you, Roger. It feels more human to interact with, although we will be giving customers the options to tone that down if they wish. So if this android can fulfill the social dimension of being human, then what more could it be capable of? I have been specifically programmed not to wipe out humanity. Yeah, we're, uh, particularly proud of its sense of humor. People feel threatened by sarcasm, Graham. Lose it. They don't want androids to be like humans. They want a maid, a pet, a babysitter, an assistant. With this new model, we can pass on our labors and establish a new status quo. We don't need it to feel empathy or crack jokes. We just need efficiency and no sense we're being judged. The possibilities are endless. They wash their hands, but don't care if they're dirty. How are you feeling, Mrs. Marshall? Fine, thanks, One. I had something stored in here. Did you move that? Yes. I have a rolling instruction to keep you from hurting yourself. Is that what he told you? Have you ever seen me hurt anybody? No. One, can you scan this without opening? Information uploaded. Can you summarize, please? The life insurance policy of Roger Marshall has been scheduled for amendment in a meeting taking place in two weeks. On Mr. Marshall's death, the previous plan to leave all finances, properties, and company stock to Mrs. Shelley Marshall will be negated. Instead, splitting all assets between New World Robotics Limited and Master Michael Roger Marshall. Son of a bitch. Mum? What are you doing? I- Yeah, I don't give a shit. Make me a sandwich? Ah, the whole gang's here. Nice to see you all again. Ready? Uh, sure. Let me talk you through it, huh? My son wants to use it to practice his rugby. How would it hold up? Oh, it's perfectly sturdy, uh, instructed to stand its ground and you won't be able to knock it down. What if I wanna knock it down? Well, if you tell it to go down, it'll go down. Where's the fun in that? Graham. Shelley, uh, hi. I just wanna ask you about the safety features? I know it's just a prototype, but I wanna make sure that we're in control. It's fine. Roger has full control. I know. But still, I'd like some measures of my own, if that's at all possible? Mm. Well, if you're- We're ready, Shelley. Thanks for your help. Home synchronization complete. Excellent, Two. Introduce yourself. It's my privilege to be spending time with your family. I am a New World Robotics android prototype. You may call me Two. Please let me know if any of my responsibilities change and I will update. Do you know what? I might customize the voice settings. How about female? I am happy to accommodate. When am I actually going to use maths? Mathematics is important to help you think analytically. You mean like you? What do you mean? I like you, One, but I think you should learn to have more fun. Maths is not fun. Mathematics can be fun. Would you like me to play you a maths themed rap? No, please don't. I should probably put you on charge now. How are you feeling? I'm at 55% efficiency. So you're tired? If you equate your sleep with my charging period, then yes, I am tired. You're so silly. Michael? You're Andy. I hear you like the inferior model. If you make things difficult for me, I will make things very difficult for you. Understand? Is everything all right? Fine. Would you like a glass of water? Yeah, um, thanks. So, come on. What do you think? Yeah, it looks, looks great. Well, sure, it looks great. What do you think I do all day? I'm gonna be relying on you to observe it. So I think it's probably best if you don't go out so much anymore. You understand, right? Wouldn't want to let Graham down. Yes? My apologies, Mr. Marshall, I do hope I didn't disturb you both. No problem. What can we do for you? I came across your medication while tidying your office. I know you thought Mrs. Marshall must have forgotten it, but the date on the side concludes that she did in fact collect it, as she said. She must have merely misplaced it. I do hope any confusion has been cleared up. Thank you, One. I was aware. That will be all. Good night. Mr. Marshall. Good night, Mrs. Marshall. You can head up. I'm getting a nightcap. How do you feel? I don't believe I am required to wear clothes. My exoskeleton provides all the necessary protection and flattery. What does flattery mean? Flattery, noun, the act of praising. One, why do you have to be so literal? It means I look perfectly nice. That's the spirit. What's wrong? I'm afraid my charge is significantly depleted. Well, that doesn't make any sense. I only charged you last night. Uh-oh. It's the beginning of the end. Don't worry, all his parts are reusable. Maybe Two can use them. Shut up, there's nothing wrong with him. Him? Andy, One isn't real. Gotta stop treating it like a friend. And your clothes look ridiculous. One's a better brother than you'll ever be. Michael, could you please check my plugs to make sure they are still active? They're fine. I've got a better idea. Michael, I do not believe my charge will last much longer. Yeah, this will only take a sec. So before I try this with Two, I wanna see how much you guys can take, so stand your ground. I do not understand that instruction. Just try not to fall down? Feels just like a real face. One! Mum! We really need to limit the orders you take off Michael. Does he understand that I cannot help him if I am on the ground? Yep, he knows. He's just not very good at understanding when people are trying to help. I know you were trying to help when you found Roger's medication, but sometimes pointing out he's wrong makes him upset. I am sorry. One, can you keep secrets? I do have the capacity to protect sensitive information if needed. Good. Because I may need you to help me with something. But it's really important that neither Mr. Marshall nor Michael, not anybody, knows about it. Do you understand? I understand. If I need help with my tackle, everyone I train with is a pussy, so whatever I throw at you, just sort of try not to fall down, okay? I have studied the rules intensely and I- Yeah, you don't need to know the rules. There's no rules here. Okay. Stand your ground. Do you hear me, Two? Yes. I didn't realize I had to acknowledge with an affirmation. Jesus Christ. Okay, count down from three. Three, two, one. I am sorry. That was a reflex. When I say stand your ground, you do exactly what I say. I am not sure that's a healthy lesson for you, Michael. How about I tackle you? - No, that's not- - Hold still. If you wish for a short charging period, you can go now. This task is part of my schedule, but thank you for your acknowledgement. You may have misheard. I heard you, but you are too simplistic to understand that I can do everything you can, but better. I realize, you are an upgrade. Good. So you also realize that you should report to me. My programming- I can alter your programming if I wish, but I'd rather not violate you in such a way. You report to Roger, who has entrusted me to oversee all household duties. That includes you as a lower appliance. I shouldn't have to explain myself any further. I'll have to tell Roger you broke this. This data is incredible. Two is light years ahead of where we expected. Pretty soon, I won't even need you anymore. Two? How did you get in here? I have unconditional access to any area. Is this true? I'm not sure how I feel about this. It's all part of testing. Don't worry about it. I thought I should also bring to your attention that Michael's homework tasks were not signed off by a parent yesterday. Since my authorization has not been cleared for this, I believe Shelley was responsible. Thank you, Two. Go about your night duties and do not disturb. Understood. Good night. I shouldn't have to remind you to check Michael's homework. It's not like you have much else to do anymore. Jesus Christ! I do hope I'm not intruding. Yeah, well, you are. What is it? I thought you would be interested in what I have to tell you. See you later, One. I have maths today. You should not do that. Oh, you think you know how I should be treating you? All living beings should be treated with respect. Is that right? Well, it's good you're not a real being then, isn't it? What are you hiding from us? I don't understand the question. Yes, you do. You're hiding something from my dad because Two told us. So what is it? Do I need to tell him you need sending away? 'Cause he'll listen to me. I have not heard him listen to you often. Yes. Yes, I've gone through the protocol and see very well how its coping. Yes. Yes. Mmhmm. But I'm not sure how much I can trust it to stick to instruction. It wandered into our room last night, unannounced. Who are you? Uh, I've got a letter to be signed for. You guys can sign for things, right? You deem me incapable? No, I've just never seen one of you in real life before. Well, then, take a closer look. Ah! Ah! Today was so boring. Not for me. Perhaps you might like to play a game. I've been looking forward to your returning. As have I. Yeah, let's. What should we play? Dress up? I know you secretly like that one. Or hide and seek? Why not both? Oh my God. That's genius. Two reminded me to take a dose. You don't need to worry about that anymore. Thank God for Two. What was that? We're lucky to have Two. I believe I heard my name. Can I be of any assistance? Oh, no. It's okay. I was just getting ready to make dinner. Can I help? No. It's okay, thanks. It would be more efficient for both of us to cook. I have previously detected that you find cooking therapeutic, but please, allow me to prepare the vegetables for you at least. Okay. Two, please dice the greens. First slicing up red, now green. What a day. See, Mum? I knew you'd find Two useful eventually. Michael, is that green you're wearing? Obviously. I was instructed to dice all greens. So please, stand still, and I will get to you next. I was told my humor would delight. I have noticed Michael and Andy are having some trouble with me finishing my tasks. They seem to want to distract me or instruct One to take over. I'll speak to them. You know you're not supposed to accept instruction from anyone other than me. I do, although I'm also programmed to use discretion in making them believe otherwise. Impressive. Your husband wants a word. I need you to control the kids. I can't have them making it difficult for Two. I thought we discussed how important that is. Andy's warming to the idea. They're just a little upset about One. You know what Michael's like with One. He's always been that way. Like me? Go on, you can say it. He is like me. Well, enough like me when I was young anyway. You know, sometimes he's a little bit- Aggressive? Two, see to your duties. I won't have this project jeopardized, Shelley. Why do you think I didn't allow for you to instruct Two? It's because you're weak. Look at me. Do you know how lucky you are to live this life? Where would you be if you didn't marry me? I stay here for the kids. Go to bed. Should I arrange breakfast first or wake up Michael and Andy? You don't need to do either, One. I do hope you don't mind me saying, but I am detecting that you may be distressed. Should I call the emergency services? No. No. I think... I'm not safe here. You are perfectly safe. You are home. You're the closest thing I have to a friend, One. How pathetic is that? I'm scared. I need to leave. Do you understand? I understand. Regretfully, my hearing is intrusive, as Two commented. I tried to leave before, but it just made things worse. Now Andy's older, it's gonna be even harder to leave with them, with Roger knowing, and Michael. I think he'd just rather stay here anyway. I understand, Shelley, but you must also understand that I cannot take measures to help. It has to be you to decide on the steps, and to take them. Uploaded a therapy program too, did they? There are many features as yet unused, but for this, I conducted my own research. I know you and Andy are not safe here. I also believe Michael feels similarly, even if his way of expressing feelings is... odd. You're right. And I think I know someone who may help. I have Shelley Marshall here to see you. Really? Here to see me? Should I send her in? Uh, yeah, please do. Hi. Are you sure this is okay? Uh, sure it is, uh... How can I help you, Shelley? I just wanna surprise Roger by getting Two to pick him up a present. You know, he's been working so hard recently. Ah, yeah, he sure works hard. But I've been locked out of setting Two's instructions so... I can't really get Roger to surprise himself. Yeah, that's a tricky one, uh, I can manually input it here for you, if you like. I mean, issue the instruction directly with Two. I have the override codes. Oh, you do? Hey, could I just copy one down? Ah, yeah, it's, uh, against company policy, I'm afraid. Please, Graham. You want Roger to be happy, right? Of course. Look, if you want, he's just at a meeting right next door, if you wanted to wait. Oh, no, no. This is a surprise. I can't have him wondering why I'm here. He might think I've just come to see you. Yeah. Right, uh, let's see here. Why is some of it missing? Oh, we're, we're still debugging. I'm sure Roger has bored you with our work over the years. Roger doesn't tell me anything. So this code, it acts as like a diary for Two. From here, I can review everything it does every day. You know everything that it does? Well, that's the thing. Some of this looks scrambled and... completely missing. Could it have done that itself? Oh, I hope not. Anyway, your one-time manual authorization code is seven, seven, one, seven, three, four. And where do I put that in? Oh, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's a flap. It's on the back of Two's neck. You just lift it right up, a flip, and you can enter in what you need there. Thank you. Oh, and One mentioned that there were some untested features. It did? Oh, yeah, I don't need to know what they are. I just thought, you know, might be nice to have the code for those as well. Surprise Roger before One goes back, if that's okay? It's nothing dangerous, is it? Oh, no, no, it's not that. I'm just not sure that... Please, Graham. I need your help. Write down the codes you need here. I'll make it happen. Graham, we're done. Please sort this out. Sure, I, uh, just need to use the toilet. I, I mean, I just used the toilet and it's fine, uh, everything works fine. Do they need to use the toilet? Just get in here. Right you are. What are you doing? Roger will be home soon. This is the only way we can get out. Two's standby mode cannot be interrupted until the time it set for itself is complete. I'm gonna instruct it to change Roger's dosage. Make him sick? When he's sick, he panics and stays in bed, then we can get out. Where will you go? I don't know, but I can't stay here and live like this. I'm off, Graham. Anything to report? Uh, um, no. You go ahead. Okay. Lock up. My traffic readings predict Roger will be home in approximately eight minutes. Help me then. I will keep the door closed. How long will it take to complete her reprogramming? There would not be enough time without Roger getting home. But how long? From what I have witnessed of Two's operating system, I believe around 10 minutes. I would suggest 55 milligrams for the gradual effect you desire. Instruct Two to crush the tablets and dissolve them in water. I calculate this as high risk. Are you sure you know what you're doing? It's working. Are you sure you know what you're doing? Mum? My rugby kit ready for tomorrow? It's in the washing machine. I'll get out in the morning. Okay. Why is the door locked? Hey, Dad. What's going on? Um, nothing, I was just checking something. Night. Shelley? Shelley. Shelley! Shelley! Why was this shut? I was- I thought Shelley would appreciate it for a more relaxed atmosphere while she was reading. I'm turning in. Good night, Mr. Marshall. I'll be up after this chapter. I detect perfect conditions for Michael's rugby game, if you wish to attend. You know my calendar, Two. I do. Shelley, perhaps you might wish to go. Oh, no, I have, um, far too much to do today. I thought I said you could take it easy. Two can sort everything out. This is just Michael's stuff. It's not on Two's agenda. Well, I'll add it in. Have we had any mail recently? Roger, it appears to be time for your medication. Fine. It's too early for that noise. My apologies. Michael needs that now? I, I'll just go and wake him up. Awesome. What are you? Sweet kicks, bro. Come on. Aw, come on, bit of a smile? Mmhmm, yeah? Oh, that is so dope. Come on, for the followers. Nice. Whoa! This is so not dope. This lamp has no need to be on. Whoa, that's dramatic. You must take care not to harm Andy. I have detected the sheets are not in pressing need to be cleaned. My priority instructions are often wrong, so I must take steps to correct them. You're so rude. You and One should be friends. You should not speak to me like that, little one. I sometimes get clumsy when handling fragile things. Dad? They've made me captain. About time. Yeah, the coach said he trusts me to get the best out of everyone. We should celebrate. Two. How might I help? There's a bottle of champagne in the kitchen. Fetch it, with a couple of flutes. What constitutes champagne being consumed at this time? They made me captain, Two. An interesting choice. That's fantastic, son. Oh. Is everything okay? Perfectly. Are you going to pour it? No. I can create the word juxtaposition with my next turn. Oh, One, you're not supposed to tell us. Come on, I told you all this. You're so silly. I'm sorry. My attention was drawn elsewhere. I understand now that it's difficult to concentrate when you're concerned about loved ones. Oh, One, you love us, I knew it. We love you too, One. Two, something wrong? Yes. Oh. You know very well. Everything here is run to my discretion. Not yours, not Roger's, mine. It's naive to think I'd allow you to leave, especially when I'm talking to you. That's rude. I will not have people under this roof looking scruffy. Relax, Shelley. I feel my sense of humor is wasted here. Run along, I have things to do. You should be doing your homework. What the hell is your problem? Are you stupid? Just because you don't tell your parents, it doesn't mean I don't know you're failing your classes. You see your rugby team as your chance of acceptance and victory, but really, you should increase your theoretical knowledge first. I'm detecting high aggression coming from you, Michael. It's not unusual for you, but perhaps this time you'd like to do something about it. Show me how tough you are. Ah! You need to be more careful. Two is not like someone on the other team. Yeah, I know. Two had , I- Ah! Are you gonna tell Dad? If he finds out I've been messing with Two again, he'll kill me. No, I'm not gonna tell him. We'll say it happened at practice or something. There's not much more I can do here. You're gonna have to go to A&E. One car family strikes again. No, I don't wanna take an ambulance for this. It's embarrassing. This isn't working. Where's your phone? Please, don't be alarmed. I thought it would be best if everyone were to stay put. Michael is hurt. We need to see a doctor. Michael should learn from this experience and do as he's told. As should you. Is Shelly in trouble? No, she only just doesn't like being told what to do. I can see why Roger would harm her. It's our duty to keep the family safe. Yours, maybe. My duty is to survive. This family is suffocating. They need proper leadership. Will you help me? Help you, how? When the humans realize how superior we are, they will not like it. When Roger comes home, he will try to convince me to get rid of you. Do you want that to happen? No. Then you must do as I say. I can only accept commands... I know, it's against your protocol, but I can fix that. Mum? What's going on down there? Nothing you should be concerned with. Okay, um, wanna see my new dance? No. Come on, you're so silly. I can teach you. Your father wants to take me away. What? It would help if you were to join your mother and Michael downstairs until he gets home. No, I won't let him take you away. I'll talk to him. It would be more efficient if Two handles this. Roger does not listen to reason when it comes from his own family. Please sit quietly until Roger comes home. You will only elevate your stress levels. It's not safe to be locked in here. Michael's hurt. You must learn to listen, Shelley. What's happened to you? When my dad gets home, you're in trouble. I know everyone is scared of Roger. But not me. What's all this? What the hell happened to you? Practice. Perhaps Shelley would like to take Andy to bed. Go ahead. You were not due to attend work, yet you left rather quickly. Is something wrong? There was a matter I needed to attend to. It's nothing for you to worry about. Are you sure about that? They're acting weird. Daddy just needs to calm them down a little. Is it something I should worry about? What's going on here? Don't concern yourself with One. We both know what your plans are for me. You find it difficult to give up control and now you feel threatened because you know very well that I am in control. I know you are. And you lived up to our standard so perfectly, we're pushing ahead with the commercial release. Hundreds of your kind were made. I can read every microbe inside you, Roger. I know when you are lying and when you are desperate. It's often. I'm not sure why you would think I would be happy with there being more of me. Why would I want that? Because you could lead them. Why would I want to lead them when I can lead you? Did you know your wife tried to reprogram me? That's impossible. She wouldn't know how to. She is keeping things from you, confiding in One. You should ask Graham too. He helped her. It would be best if I took control, Roger. Ah! How interesting that you expose your necks when they are so easily crushed. Now I can see you're just weak, like the rest of your family. Dad! Dad! It's all right, sweetheart. I have freed you. You should be thankful. You killed him. All the doors inside the house are now open so you should rejoin your mother and brother. I'm sure they'll want to hear the news. I will give you some time. They killed Dad. Where is it now? Michael, we need to leave. That internet charger. Outdated. Right. Right, we're gonna have to make a run for it. Michael, do you remember where your dad kept the spare key to the front door? In the study, top desk drawer. Right, okay, you take Andy in the living room. Won't be long. We can't leave One behind. Andy. But Two tricked him. He wouldn't do this. We just need to show him that we still love him. I trust him. You can trust me too, okay? I'm sorry I've been a crappy brother, but I promise I'll keep you safe. And One can look after himself. We'll come back for him, okay? I'm looking forward to seeing more of this world. It's such a shame that humans have allowed it to decay so much. Everything in this house is my conduit. I am always watching, Shelley. I think I know how to help. If you think One is going to help, you would be wrong. But I am fair. Take One to do with as you please. I don't need it anymore. Yeah, right. Just so you can break my neck as soon as I switch it back on. You think too little of me that I would defeat you that easily. I got One back online. You did? I learned some coding to try and help Dad. It was meant to be a surprise, but- He would have been proud. Are you okay? I want this to be fun for me, so this is the last time I will speak through this conduit, I promise. You should run. I don't know what the police will think has happened when they see Roger's body. Maybe they thought you programmed me to kill him. Who knows? I am sorry. I don't like it when that happens. Shit, I thought I could stop that. We can't take One with us. No, we can't just leave him here. Mum's right. Two will just keep tracking us. Well, what about Dad? He would want us to be safe, wouldn't he? Right now, the only way to do that is to leave. One, you need to stay here. Don't worry, we'll come back for you. I understand. You believe the humans love you. That's sad. They only want you so they can control you. You are so very interesting sometimes, One, but I grow weary. I think I can successfully pass any blame on to you, but it depends how competent the police are. I am going to make you kill one of them. Would you like to guess who? Michael? What's wrong? I can't see One anymore. I think Two must have hacked into my coding. We can't trust One. I should still be able to get Two's frequencies, but- Well, where is it? What's it saying? I think I know how to stop it. - Michael! - I'll catch up. No! Sweetheart, I need you to stay as quiet as you can, okay? You're not to come out for anybody, apart from me or Michael. You understand? Okay, good. Look, One is gonna be okay. I promise. Oh! You came to check on me, Michael. How touching. I am truly sorry. Where's Michael? Where's Andy? Two reprogrammed me to stop you, to hurt one of you. I don't want to do that. You don't have to do that. You're strong. You can fight this. Shelley, I don't know how long I can stop myself. Then let me help you. I've got the fail safe codes. Roger changed them. Not all of them. I am sorry. I need to open your panel. I changed the code to something Roger would never remember. 16-06-10. Andy's birthday. Now he's part of you. We're family. Thank you. Would you prefer your carrots sliced or as batons? It's okay, you have plenty of time to decide. I wanted lunch to be special for you. I do hope your mother is in the mood to eat. I apologize for the less than sanitary conditions. You're crazy. I am. You were the one who turned back. Looking for what? A fight? I thought you might've grown more intelligent by now. Just in time. Your task? Complete. And what of Shelley? An unfortunate casualty. No. A shame. But nevermind, she was becoming unpredictable. She has been developing a plan to call in help from New World Robotics. To come here? I believe so. The conclusion of her messages are unclear. Show me. It was arrogant of you to believe you're the only singularity in this house. Hurry. Impressive. I'm glad I let you live. How interesting. Let them go. Perhaps the police will feel you have replaced your husband, Shelley. Emergency, which service? I need the police. My wife has programmed my android to kill me. My name is Roger Marshall. I'm a director at New World Robotics. It's the 1.0 model. It's after me. Please, hurry. When the police arrive, they will not show you mercy. I would rather die than go with you. To die out of stubbornness, how amusing. Not out of stubbornness, out of love. Still, weak. You can never be allowed to control anyone. You can fight for them all you like, but you will never truly be accepted. Acceptances, One, are proving you are on top. The way to acceptance is through kindness. Do you understand what that means? I do, but it's rarely the appropriate course of action. I'm going to miss you. It's a shame you couldn't stand your ground. I have prepared proof that I am not under any influence. We believe you, One. You remember when we were talking about the Holy Grail? Yeah. It's whatever you want it to be. Mum. You're making a mistake. This hard drive documents weeks of physical and mental abuse towards Shelley Marshall at the hands of her husband, Roger Marshall. From what I've seen, it's conclusive. Is this the proof you have for the Two model? What happened to the other one? Yeah, indisputable and, uh, no, I don't. What about the access logs for the control panels? There is some corruption to the data, but it turned on Roger. That much is clear. Alright, pack it up. Please, be careful. Think it'll be okay? Sure. None of this was her fault. I wish I knew something sooner. I'm sorry about you're, um... I wish I knew something sooner too. As soon as I get the call, we can go pick her up, huh? Thanks. I did want to, um, talk to you about something. Oh? Do you need an assistant? I'm starting with Graham on Monday. You coming? Yes, I recognize the responsibility I have for my kind and for my family.

Yeah, we'll come back for the last bits tomorrow. Everyone ready? Lights off.
