Jane? Hey. Do you want to talk about it? It might help if we talked. It might help me, Jane. Mom's gone, Carla. Talking about it can't stop the funeral, can it? Painkiller One, this is Homeboy. Do you copy? Over. Painkiller One, do you copy? Over. We're online. This is Painkiller, Homeboy, in the ballpark, ready to play. Reading you, Lima-Charlie Painkiller. Hold on for sat lockup. Roger that, Homeboy. Holding this position for sat lockup. So, Captain... if you could be anywhere but this rathole right now where'd you want to be? That rathole across the street. - You? - That would be X-rated. Be careful what you wish for, soldier. Viper team? Here, Captain. Just say the word. Pretty relaxed perimeter for a heroin lab. Maybe. Homeboy, this is Painkiller One. You reading any other perimeter control on this location? Over. Negative on your perimeter, Painkiller. You have one ghost on the front door and... six in the roost. We good to go, Homeboy? It's your intel, Jane. Your call. I don't like it. We're all dressed up. Might as well go to the dance. We say Nike, Homeboy. Nike. You have the green, Painkiller. Repeat, you have the green. Roger. Out. Go... go. Go... go. Go! Move in. We got in. Something's not right. This isn't a heroin lab. Painkiller Two. Painkiller Two, come in. Clear this room! Flynn! Regain my team, Sergeant. What? Where's Flynn? Captain. What is this? They're all like this. Clear out! Get his uniform. Let's go. Sergeant, help him out. Move your ass! Homeboy, if you copy, we've got a bio in here. I need evac and a medical team immediately. Bravo-Echo-Lima. Hold your fire. We are United States soldiers on an anti-narcotics mission with the full knowledge of the Russian government. Painkiller One, this is Homeboy. Do you copy? Over. Painkiller One, this is Homeboy. Do you copy? What's going on? Where am I? You're at an Army medical facility in Virginia. As you were, Captain. It's good to see you, Jane. How long have I been out, sir? Three days here, five days since we lost contact. Five? And my team? We weren't able to recover anybody else. What's going on here, sir? Go ahead. Scar tissue, no discoloration, no swelling. Those wounds aren't five days old. What's happened to me? That's what we're gonna find out. Have you ever heard of knocking? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Who are you? Graham Knight. Dr. Graham Knight. You're not military. Me? No. I'm... I've got a birth defect. I'm a coward. No, I'm what the military euphemistically refers to as a "outsource expert." Expert in what? I have a Ph.D. in bio-toxicology. I'm a professor at Braddock College in Maryland. Colonel Watts asked me to head the medical team on your case. My case? He wants me to help identify what you were exposed to. All right. Special Ops Training School, graduated in 1999. Congo, 2000. Afghanistan, '01. That's a very impressive résumé. I'm what the government euphemistically refers to as a real "overachiever." That's putting it mildly. It says here that your parents died when you were 15? Raised by an older sister. Parents died how? Is this relevant, Doctor? Family history is always relevant. The Army is my family. But it must have been very tough... Excuse me, did I miss the part of your résumé about pop psychology? I'm just trying to be friendly, Captain. I don't need friends. What I need is to get out of this box find out what happened to me, and get the people responsible. You gonna help me do that? You gonna let me do my job? Double King with cheese, hold the onions. No, check that. Make it a chili burger with chili fries, and nachos and a chocolate milkshake, with whipped cream, to go. Well, the good news is, she's definitely not contagious. And the bad news is? I don't know if I'd actually call it bad news. I don't really know exactly what I'd call it. In order to ascertain whether she was exposed to a viral or bacterial agent as she said we introduced different varieties of antigens into her blood sample. Now, in order to get a baseline we drew blood from one of the technicians and introduced a variation of the measles virus. Now, in a healthy individual the natural defenses of the blood will attack and kill a virus within 45 seconds. Now, we introduced the same measles variation with the blood drawn from Captain Browning. Wait. Can you play that back at normal speed? That... that was normal speed, Colonel. Which means? Which means Captain Browning's metabolic rate her immune response operates at 20 times normal speed. Whatever she was exposed to over there has changed her. In other words, she's unlike any human being on the planet. Captain, this way. You gonna take me to the head, too? Your new quarters, Captain. Yes, Captain Browning? Oh, sorry, sorry. Try knocking, right? I brought you some real food. The works. It's not exactly health food, Doc. I had to sneak it past your bodyguards. What are they gonna do, shoot me? Thanks. It doesn't look good for me, does it? You know, Jane, there's always two ways of looking at things. It's Chinese. Wei Ji. The top part is "danger" and the bottom is "opportunity." Two characters, one word. "Crisis." Every crisis has both. Your choice. - Don't you want some? - No, I gotta go back to work and... We're going to nail this thing, Jane. Promise. - Why weren't we informed about this? - I don't report to you, Don. This has national security written all over it. We don't even know what we're dealing with yet. For all we know, she could end up like one of those people she described in Sovetskoe. - Who else knows about this? - My medical team. What does she know? She's one of the most intelligent officers I've ever known. We could be sure she's putting two and two together. Well, that's what I'm afraid of. An asset like that... She's not an asset. She's a soldier. A soldier who was shot three times and recovered completely in less than five days! I want to know how that happens and then I want to know how to replicate it. Is that clear? Good. Hey, sis. Wow, you look okay. What are you doing here? I got a call. Let's take a walk. He told me you'd been wounded. I was, but I'm better now. - You never were a very good liar. - They're still doing tests. - What kind of tests? - I'm not a doctor. Well, I am and I wanna know. Carla, this isn't high school. This is the military. I don't have to tell you anything. But you could. You should know better than that. - Why do you always do this? - Do what? You always keep your feelings boxed up. You always want to go it alone. Can't you tell me anything? Carla, I'm an officer in the United States Army. And I'm your family. Don't do this by yourself. You shouldn't have come. Captain! Oh, come on, Captain! Give us a break! What's happened to me? What's happened to me? Captain? What the hell were you thinking? What kind of virus does this? You keep me locked up in a room that wouldn't qualify for a cheap motel stick two goons on my ass day and night. And I'm on video so much I could have my own website. - We did it for your own good. - My own good? - Don't I get a say? - Hell, no. - You're a soldier. - Yes, sir, I am. But what happened in Sovetskoe happened to me. I think you owe me. Owe you? Owe you what? The truth. You may not like what you hear. You're looking at the only-known photograph of Peter Irfan. Orphaned when he was only four. Raised in a series of desolate state institutions. Recognized early as possessing a genius IQ with a particular aptitude for science. Educated in Belgrade, the Soviet Union, East Germany. Then about 15 years ago when the Wall came down, he disappeared. Now, since then, we believe he's become part of a global criminal enterprise with tentacles reaching into everything from legitimate businesses to governmental organizations. Black market nuclear technology, international arms dealers, fraud commodities manipulations a network of financing social entropies so complex... Their activities appeared to have only been directed at maximizing profit. But there's new disturbing evidence that a more vicious strategy has emerged. An intricate web of science and technology directed toward some unknown goal we can't yet define. Now, Irfan's specialty is biochemistry psychotropic drugs, bioweapons. We have evidence the operation in Sovetskoe was just a front for one of his experiments. The question is, an experiment for what? - Why wasn't I told this before? - Nothing to tell. Your mission, your intel. It gave us nothing to indicate that Sovetskoe was Irfan's op. What makes you think it was? Every bioweapon has a marker, Jane. A genetic fingerprint. Whatever you were exposed to has those markers. You've seen it before, it's like a signature. Irfan's signature. Then you know what I'm infected with? Dr. Knight helped us rule out what it's not. But it's clear that Irfan is working on something new. More virulent than you've ever seen. Sir, I request immediate reassignment to whatever unit is going after him. I'm afraid that's not possible, Jane. You've been transferred, Alaska, to a more secure facility. At least until we find out what you've been exposed to. This man is responsible for the death of my entire team. He's responsible for what happened to me. I wanna go after him. I have a right. I'm sorry, Jane. Not anymore. Captain? I wanted you to know that I... I requested permission to continue working on your case but... it was denied. I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Anyway, friends? Sure. Captain. Dr. Collins to radiology. Dr. Collins to radiology, please. - Sergeant? - Yes, ma'am? Patek Philippe, Chronoswiss, the IWC Portugieser. Believe me, you're not gonna have any trouble moving them. So, are we cool? Yeah, I'm happy. All right. Nice doing business with you. Yeah. Get off. I said get off. Last chance. Lady, I think your last chance is with me. You better be good. Just don't fall off. How do you like the trip so far? Fire your weapon, soldier. I gave you an order! It's all right. My place. You're hit. I'm fine. You're a thief. I like to think of it as redistributing wealth. Flashlight. What the... A piece of bullet. Nick... Nick. - Who's this clown? - His name is Blue. Like "Code Blue" for emergencies. You want to let a brother loose now? - Look, if I could just take my... - No. Look, you need a hospital, okay? I'll be fine in a couple of hours. In a couple of hours you'll be hanging with Tupac and Biggie, all right? He's pretty good with gunshot wounds. Not this kind. - Where are my clothes? - We had to cut them off. Sorry. Hotshot, you're carrying a truckload of meds. Why don't you just ditch me? Is that what you would have done? I didn't ask for any favors. No, you just put a gun to my head. - I didn't have a choice. - Yeah, well, neither did I. I had a good thing going, now I've got the Army after me. All I got to show for it is you. Nick. Nick what? Nick "that's all you need to know" Nick. And right now, I'm the only friend you got. Dude, I'm telling you. Look, there's something weird about her. - What, like Jerry Springer weird? - No... no. See, I'm talking ET, Area 51 Brother From Another Planet- type weird. Look. All that mess that went down at the airport and not one single mention about it in the news or anything like that? What does that say to you? I'll tell you what it says. It says weird. Just like her. I mean, she creeps me out, man. Yeah, I could tell by the way you were staring at her when we cut her clothes off. See, that was like the... that was professional. That's what that was. Professional. I mean, but she is kind of like a fine-ass alien, you know? Garde, sucker. It's over for you, man. I see dead people. It is over. No way. Relax, "Kevorkian," it was just a scratch. - Look, lady, what I saw was a... - Maybe you saw too much. Yeah... yeah. That's... Definitely. Hell, now that you mention it I think it was just like a scratch or something like that. No, a paper cut. Yeah, definitely. - Who's winning? - Do you play? I know the moves, that's about it. Blue here thinks he's Bobby Fischer. Yeah, well, against you, I can be SpongeBob, all right? Not tonight. Black rook to F5. White knight to H5. Black bishop to F3. Check. White king to C1. Rook to A1. Mate. White loses. He doesn't know how to use a door? He can get from one end of this city to the other without ever seeing the light of day. I'm talking sewers, maintenance tunnels gas, electric, phone, he knows them all. It's like one big Super Mario Brothers game down there to him. What do we got? Chinese. - He got a name? - "Squeak." - He got a home? - Yeah. Here. He likes you. What does he do when he doesn't like somebody? He bites. Damn. See, now, that was a seven... No... No, see, that was a five-move. Combination to mate? Beginner's luck? My ass. What, you don't like the food? So, what'd you do to get everybody so pissed-off at you? I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. Excuse me. I have some stamps to lick. If you want to help me, just... You can't joke with him like that. He's a very jumpy dude. Unlike you? It helps to stay calm in my line of work. "Redistributing the wealth." Looks like you're good at it. Looks like it. Let me guess. Nobody ever gets hurt. Never ever. So, what happens now? - With what? - With you. I'm gonna find a guy or let him find me. And then? I'm gonna ask him some questions. Then I'm gonna kill him. Are you telling me she's going after Peter Irfan herself? I'd bet on it. That can't happen. Don, she feels personally violated here. You can't totally disregard her psychological state. I don't care about her psychological state. And frankly, I'm a little concerned that you do. We have a valuable asset on the loose. We can't let it fall into the wrong hands. Look, if we can't have her, no one can. Is that understood? What, you can't sleep either? There's plenty more in the fridge if you want. Who taught you how to iron? Self-taught. It gives me something to do at 2.00am. It's also amazing therapy for insomnia. Back of the collar first. In from the edges, then the front. In from the edges, then the sleeves. - Back first. - An expert? The Army taught me everything I know. Not anymore. Why don't you look on the bright side? Now you can open that fluff and fold you always wanted. That's better. Anything I can do? Yeah. Make sure I don't sleep in. Hey, Nick? Thanks. Thanks for what you've done. Anytime. Yo. What? She's gone? And that's not all. The money. "Sorry"? Dr. Knight's on a consultation. - Consultation? - Yeah. He goes up to DC all the time. Government stuff. Any idea when he'll be back? Hard to say. Gee, I really need to talk to him about my final grade. Any way to reach him? No. I wouldn't know. Sorry. Will you excuse me for one minute? Excuse me. Is that Dr. Graham Knight? Yeah. That's him. Graham Knight. Dr. Graham Knight. Step into the center of the room. Put your hands on your head, interlock your fingers. Turn around, get on the floor. - Jane? - The floor! I was hoping you'd find me, Captain. Shut up. Get up, sit on the couch. Who the hell are you? Lucas Insley, Military Intelligence. - Whose? - Ours. - Why the cover? - I'm on a job. - Me? - Not exactly. I'm tracking a ghost. Peter Irfan? There is no Peter Irfan. Peter Irfan doesn't exist. He's a fiction, a camouflage. - For what? - Not "for what." For who. For your mentor, Jane, your CO, Colonel Ian Watts. In the late '80s, our government had an active bioweapons program. Defensive purposes dedicated to "what-if" scenarios and guess who headed it up? The political pressure got too hot. The program got shut down. And a lot of people didn't like that decision. You're saying Watts kept it active? Sub-rosa, off the books. Totally rogue. And he had a great cover. Peter Irfan. An enemy without a face who could be blamed whenever anybody got close to uncovering his operation. A phantom that could never be caught, because he didn't exist. But why? We think Watts' operation morphed into something more ambitious. We think he graduated to full-scale bioengineering using sophisticated gene-splicing technology to alter human capabilities. - You're lying. - No, it gets better, or worse. Evidently, his subjects did develop new abilities. Nothing superhuman. They just became more of what they were. Sound familiar? But there was a flaw. Everyone died, eaten alive by their own cells. That was before "Operation Painkiller." That was before you. Sovetskoe was Watts' operation until you stumbled into it. If it was Watts' operation, why would he send us in there? He didn't. You picked the target, remember? You made the case so well with the brass. He couldn't overrule you without blowback on his motives. He had to let you in. He just had no intention of ever letting you out. Don't you understand? He betrayed Painkiller. He betrayed you. And he knows what you are. You're the one that didn't die. You're the one that finally can accelerate the evolutionary clock. No wonder he wanted you in Alaska. Get on the floor. Jane. Jane, please think. Just don't let your emotions affect your judgment. Do it. Jane. You need someone you can trust. We can work together, Jane. Help me out. I mean, we can take him down together. And then what? So you and your buddies can have a piece of me instead? Jane, I know this must be hard to take but I can help you. We can help... Captain? Captain? Mr. Pierce. Got a minute? So, you're saying you're just a victim in all of this? It was either roll with it or die. What was I supposed to do? - How long did she stay? - Twenty-four hours. Her condition? Seemed fine to me. Is she some kind of spy, terrorist? I'm gonna give you my private number. If you should see her or hear from her you're gonna give me a call, won't you? She's not coming back here. You want to be on my side on this one, Mr. Pierce. Or? Use your imagination. It's nice doing business with you. - Hey. - Hey. You're right. I can't do this alone. Looks like nothing's changed. Except me. Can I have a look? Yeah. - You said this happened when? - Three days ago. Unbelievable, right? All I can say is, I wish you were lying. It would be funny if it weren't so damn scary. Why didn't you tell me about this before? I didn't wanna get you involved. I was afraid it would be too dangerous. I'm sorry. Yeah, I see things, Carla. Letters jumping off pages, people appearing and disappearing. It's like the world is this big jigsaw puzzle that's been blown apart. When it comes back together, everything's different, new. Maybe your brain is doing what your body is doing. Making connections faster, doing more than normal. It's gonna kill me, isn't it? Well, no. I didn't say that. But I need to get you into a proper testing facility. Carla, the second I go above ground, they'll turn me into a lab rat. Jane, I'm your sister. They're not gonna get their hands on you. No. That's exactly what we're gonna do. What? Let them get their hands on me. And you're gonna help. Business is booming, huh? How the hell did you get in here? - Nice hair. - Oh, this place is nothing compared to some of the places I've gotten into. Where's my money? I've got a way you can earn it back. You want me to work for my own money? Well, strictly speaking. It's not really yours, is it? Hey, I trusted you, and what did I get? Ripped off. You know, why don't you just come out and say what's really on your mind? Just say, "I need your help, Nick." Come on, it's easy. I need your help, Nick. What do you need? So, what happens now? Are you certain it's Dr. Knight? Sir, it's Browning's sister. She said she won't talk to anyone but you. I'll get back to you. - Watts here. - My sister wants to turn herself in. Leave the building alone. Take the I-95 into Baltimore. Exit East Eden Boulevard. Take a right on Fern, across Third. There's an alley on your right. He's at the location. Stand by. Negative. We've got nothing. You're standing right next to him. Climb. Welcome to Oz, Colonel. Have a seat. The party will be joining you soon. Oh, and by the way, get "Moe" and "Curly" off my street. They're affecting property values. - You okay? - Yeah, fine. - You trashed his phone? - Yeah. Was he armed? Something to remember me by. You want me to stick around? I'll watch your back. No, thanks. Look, it's none of my business... You're right. It's none of your business. Your job's over, Nick. Thank you. Okay, hotshot. Your deal. I hardly recognize you. This is an unusual choice for a meeting. I figured you wouldn't want to try anything too messy with hundreds of witnesses around. I'm on your side, Jane. What side is that? I can't help what happened. All I can do is promise to protect you. Like you did in Sovetskoe? What's the matter, Colonel? You seem a bit nervous. Jane, look. If there's anything I could have done to prevent what happened, so... Oh, let's cut the crap! - It's between you and me now. - What are you talking about? They know Sovetskoe was your operation. - "They"? - Military Intelligence. Captain Lucas Insley. - Who? - Insley, Lucas. A Captain. Never heard of him. But you've heard of Graham Knight, haven't you? Is this his idea? Did he set up this meeting? Jane, I have never lied to you, and I'm not going to begin to now. The real Graham Knight is dead. My men found him with his throat cut in a shack in the Florida Keys. I found that out an hour ago. Don't you get it? Knight is Irfan. Knight is Irfan. He's playing us, Jane. You, me, all of us! He's using you to get to me. Once I'm out of the picture, he's got you all to himself. Stand back! Stand back! Get down! Nick! Nick! Over here! I'm going for the shooter! Move! Move, move! Get out of the way! Jane? You need me. Remember? I wanna know what this thing is that you gave me. Oh, the question you should be asking yourself is what is it that you gave me? - What is that? - It's you. You gave it to me at Wilkins. - My blood? - No, more than that. Remarkable. You have about three seconds to start making sense. Ever since our little encounter in Sovetskoe everyone's been trying to figure out what did the virus do to you when all I want to know is what did you do to the virus? Now I know. You've helped me jump a million years in biology. You're the next step in human evolution. You're the new Eve. You're insane. Well, I think in time, you'll change your mind. I couldn't possibly leave you to fools like Watts. How could they possibly know what to do with someone as unique as you, Jane? Why should we be satisfied with who we are? Why should we be limited by the random acts of biology that created us? I think we should be more than who we are. I mean, what if we could change, you know? We could change everything? The point of life is not to just be. It's to become. Grey! This is gonna hurt. A shame. Just think of what we could've done with her. She didn't wanna be used that way. Well, she won't be used by anyone now. As a matter of public record, she died from wounds suffered while trying to escape transfer from Wilkins. That incident at the mall never really happened. Is that clear? Clear. Good. I need a few moments alone. That sound okay with you? A new name, new history. Birth certificate, driver's license, Social Security card. All current and all clean. And you were left this boat by an uncle and he left you some money. Thank you. Oh, we'll figure out how to pay me back later. We never found that vial or the shooter. No, it's at the bottom of the Potomac... with Irfan. I need a drink. You're buying, right? Let's go, Pipsqueak. What is it? It's a scarab beetle. Egyptian. It represents rebirth. So... one big happy family. Yeah. Gentlemen. We're ready to begin.
