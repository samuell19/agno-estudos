[eerie ambient music] [dramatic electronic music] - We've been at this for 16 hours. How come you don't look tired? - Helena, do have an ETA on lockdown? - [Helena] Coming up, Cap. - I like this. It's what I do. - All the storage compartments are stowed. We're locked and loaded, Helena. - Sheridan and Lincoln are just in, Cap. - [Nile] Good work. See you on the bridge. - [Computer] Navigational report still computing. - No. - [Nile] Reno, are you done with that navigational report? - [Computer] Estimated time of completion four minutes. - [Nile] Reno, I don't want to have to ask again. - Okay, Cap, sure. Smooth sailing as usual, no problem. - [Computer] Warning, navigational report incomplete. - Incomplete, incomplete. - Want some? Damn, that's the first thing I'm gonna do when we get home. I'm gonna get a porterhouse steak thick as my fist. Gonna need a plasma torch just to cut the damn thing, and a beer and two gallons of whip cream. - Steak and whip cream? - Ain't for the steak. See, that's for the pretty boy who brings me the steak. - Yeah, right. [laughing] - I'm gonna rock his world. [dramatic orchestral music] - Hello, Captain. - Reactor online. Everything is in green. - Good, power up the drives. - Beginning computations, hyperdrive on your mark. - Homeward bound. It's been a long haul, ladies. Holy Christ! Nixie and Gelario, where the hell did they come from? - Oh my God. [suspenseful orchestral music] Tulerium materializing off the port bow. - Navigation report, I want to know how we missed them and how to get the hell out of here. - Tulerium materializing off the stern. - Christ, they're everywhere. - Sheridan-- - Navigation report, it's incomplete. God damn it, Reno. - Next Tulerium due in seven seconds. - Reno, Helena, get up here. Austin, talk to me. - I don't have their ellipse yet. It's not enough time. - Look out. - We're going on. - What? - You're gonna kill us. - What happened to the navigation report, Reno? - What are you talking about? - Don't give me that bull! - We meet at a time and a place, ladies. Back to your stations. Brace for impact. - Point five and closing, we've got no clearance. - No worries. [thudding] [electricity crackling] [screaming] Damage report. - Thermal couplings three and four are hit. I've got spikes down line. - Radiation in the fuel core has just went off the scale. - Temperature building, she's gonna blow. - Prepare to jettison fuel three and four. - Are you insane? - Shut up, Reno. - It isn't a buyer, and it's too fast to be static. - I'm red-lining to meltdown. Jettison fuel cells. - Cells away. [explosion booming] Unbelievable, hyperdrive in three, two, one. - Thank God. [breathing heavily] - [Reno] It's like a pit bull. Funniest thing I've ever seen. Well, I just left him standing there, you know? It was only because I had to make my point. - If you ever give me an incomplete navigation report again, I will relieve you of duty and haul you back as cargo. You read me, Reno? - It was a malfunction. I swear it was-- - I don't want to hear it. You almost got us killed. We're not out of it yet. We had to jettison 80% of our fuel back there. - And? - And we don't have enough fuel to make it back to Ares Eight. [dramatic orchestral music] - Isn't somebody gonna say something? - Linc, it's okay. - It's not okay. Come on you, guys. Didn't you just hear what Nile said? We're not gonna make it home. - No, I didn't say that, Lincoln. Now we've been on a distress beacon since we entered normal space, but no one's gonna pick it up out here. We have to make an emergency refueling stop. - Where? - The only place there is, Cessarian Four. - The penal colony. - Yep. - Relax. It's refueling only. We don't have to party with them. - So when's the dock? - 10 hours, communication range in four. Get some rest. - Sheridan, you said this was gonna be an easy gig. [door whooshing] [beeping] - Nile. - What's on your mind, Austin? - Are you sure about refueling at Cessarian Four? I've heard a lot of things about that place, all of them bad. - I've heard them, too. - They have to run their supplies in on droid ships, because the shuttle pilots won't fly in there. [electricity crackling] Ah, old timers use the name like it's a curse. - It's a penal colony, a prison planet. It's been that way for hundreds of years. It doesn't get much more cursed than that. It's all superstition and rumor, Austin. We're not even gonna set foot there. And this is something the rest of the crew doesn't need to hear. Everyone's wound up tight enough as it is. You understand? - Yeah, yeah, I just got a bad feeling. That's all. - Let's see if we can raise them. We should be in range by now. [dramatic electronic music] [beeping] - Cessarian Station, this is Alexandria, TCB one, eight, 1935. Calling Cessarian Station, this is Alexandria, tango charlie baker, one, eight, one, nine, three, five, are you receiving me? - Still nothing? - Not a peep. - [Computer] Warning, unidentified vessel, no unauthorized approach, warning. - Orbit in 30 minutes. Cessarian Station, this is Alexandria, tango charlie baker, one, eight, one, nine, three, five. Are you receiving me? No interference, nothing, what do you think? - I think we don't have much choice. Attention all crew. We've been unable to reach Cessarian Four. This means our only option is to approach the base directly. It's technically a violation, but will be logged as an emergency measure under my authority. Nile out. [dramatic orchestral music] - Wait, low-level chatter, must be, uh, surface communications. - Boost it. - Coming up. I'll put it in the box. [man shouting and laughing] - You know what that is, you what that is! Yeah, that's mine! Yeah, that's mine! Die, you bastard. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Die, you bastard. No blood, no blood for you. No blood for you. No blood for you. Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! - Tell me you didn't just put that all over the ship. - I got a real bad feeling about this. Energy discharges outside the perimeter. Could be anything. I can get visual now, if you want it. - Put it up. - You got it. [suspenseful orchestral music] Jesus, well, now we know why we couldn't raise anybody. They're too busy kicking the hell out of each other. What do you think? - Any communication? [grunting] - No. [suspenseful orchestral music] [grunting] - I'm gonna dust 'em off. - You're kidding. - No. [grunting] - Forward drill fire. - Nile to crew, hold tight. We're entering a steep dive. - 300 meters, 200 meters, 100 meters, 90, 80, that's all she's gonna take, Niles. Pull her up. - Not yet. - Pull her up! - Not yet. - We're at critical. - Hang on. [grunting] Okay. Let's set her down nice and easy. - Damn, you kill me. - Reno, Helena, get to the airlock with a medikit. I'll join you as soon as we're on the ground. We're gonna have a visitor. [sighing] [dramatic electronic music] [breathing heavily] - Thank you. Officer Vigo. - Take him to quarantine. Officer Vigo, we've had no contact with anyone from your base. - There is no one to contact. Nobody except me and that bastard out there. - [Nile] What? - There was an uprising, and it was bad. I mean, it was really, really bad. - Are you trying to tell me that everyone's dead? - The life support was damaged. They were gonna evacuate the base, all the prisoners first, leaving the skeleton crew, me and six others, to do the repairs. See, that's when the killing started. I thought I could take him down if I could get him outside the base. He knows the layout better than anybody. I finally get him outside. That's when you show up. - Who is he? - 762, he's the killer. He killed all of 'em. This guy's not even human. - So what's the plan, Captain? - Look, I don't know why you're here, but whatever the reason, it's not good enough. Turn your ship around and get the hell out of here while you can. - We need fuel badly. - Come on, there is no way. The docking platform is down. The only way it can be raised is from inside the base. - How far down is the platform? - 400 meters and it's blind. The fueling depot is underground. You'll never get something this big down there. And if you did, he'd be there to kill you first. - You let me worry about that. - Look, I don't think you're getting the picture here. I buried 200 men. And if you go down there, I'm gonna be burying you, too. - If we enter the base, we'll become vulnerable. - You think one guy really poses that kind of a threat? - Yes! - You just watch yourself, huh? - We've got the hardware if we want to go in armed. - You listen to me. I was good at my job. And Niles' good at flying her, so I've been told. But you see, this guy, he's good at killing, nothing else, except killing. You want to make the same mistake we did, you go in there. But you be prepared to pay the-- [beeping] - Christ. - We'll get in. We'll get out. We'll go home. We don't have a choice. [voice garbling] [suspenseful orchestral music] - I'm telling you, Sheridan. I checked the schematics myself. I know we're coming in too low. - There's a defense shield at 200 meters. If it goes up while we're outside, we're out of luck. - And if we're inside? - Well, fueled up we have a chance. No fuel, no home. I don't like it any better than you do. - Did he tell them about the shield? - Yeah. - I thought so. - So what? - So what? He told them everything. He's up there right now, like a Mexican tour guide. He's showing them just where to go. [dramatic orchestral music] - In 1,000 meters we're gonna be over the refinery. We should be able to see the platform shaft after we cross the field. Look to the east. It almost looks peaceful from up here. - [Computer] Danger-- - Niles, I'm getting a-- - [Computer] Shields up. - Full shields! - Helena, get me a reading. - Pull up, Nile, the whole field is going. - No, that's just what he wants. [explosion booming] [grunting] - Damage report-- - Shields holding, but the energy we're burning-- - You gotta trust me. [explosion booming] - Main energy grid is down, rerouting. - We're going through. Hold on. [explosion booming] - Nice bit of flying, Nile. - We're not home yet. Austin? - Maneuvering power is in the red, but holding. The shaft is just ahead, right where he said it would be. - See, I told ya. [breathing heavily] - You're mine. You're mine. You're mine. You're mine. You're mine. You're mine. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. You are mine. You're mine. You're mine. You're mine. You're mine. Yeah, you're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine! You're mine, you're mine! [yelling] Damn it, six, you are mine! [dramatic orchestral music] - [Austin] Hate to tell you this, but the refueling sequence is negative. - We'll have to do it manually. Tell Lincoln and Sheridan to take it. - I'll go. - Right, I don't think so. - I know I was unsteady back there, but I'm okay, really. I'm sure your people are qualified, but they don't know the sequence. And I do. That will save time, and that's the most important thing. - All right. [dramatic electronic music] - He's set. - Wish me luck. - [Computer] Airlock activated. Powering up main energy grid. - Main power grid back online. Status report? - He's a little more than half done. Now everything he's right about seems too pat. Everything he doesn't know seems like he's hiding something. Don't you think? - Maybe. I just don't like him on principle. - Just put that anywhere. - Very funny. Sheridan, it's a prisoner's uniform. - Almost there. Estimated time of completion, 10 minutes. - Any problems? - Not that I can see. You wanna talk to him? - Not Especially. [door whooshing] - Cap, you gotta look at this. It was tucked away in his suit. [suspenseful orchestral music] - It's a prisoner's uniform, all right. We can only assume that he's an escaped inmate. - And that his whole story doesn't mean a thing. - Yeah, well he's out there messing with the fuel lines right now. - No, it doesn't make any sense. Besides, whatever he's doing, he's almost done. We can't stop him now. - We could try. - You know, maybe, maybe he just wants to get off this rock as bad as the rest of us do. - Oh, yeah, maybe he wants to serenade us from the loading dock, huh? Grow up! - Austin! - Look, back off, Sheridan, okay? You're little sister-- - [Nile] Stand down, everyone! - Hey, hey, it's cool. - [Computer] Procedure activated. - Wait, look, refueling sequence complete. We're taking on fuel. - Vigo, this is Nile. What's your status? Vigo, are you receiving me? - Oh, you're gonna love this. - There's no one out there. [ominous orchestral music] - Nobody. [screaming] - [Computer] Scanning salvage vessel age 27 years, make model T40, crew six, ship is refueling, time of completion nine hours, 14 minutes. - I don't know about you ladies, but I want to get off this planet. And in order for me to get home, I need you to work as a crew. And I don't need attitude, and I don't need fights. And I don't need screw ups. And I sure as hell expected a lot more from you. - I don't know what got into me. I'm sorry. - Let's get back to our stations and try and get some work done. Nine hours to juice up. Until then, we just sit tight. - So do you really think he's a killer? - Looks that way. Why? Is he getting you horny? - No. Oh God, he's really handsome, though, isn't he? I mean, don't you just wonder about a guy like that? I mean, can't you just imagine that he would-- - Oh, no, no, go on. Let's hear about how you want him to sweep you off your feet, take you away with him. - No, I didn't mean it like that. - Look, lay off, Reno. - No, no, come on. Let's hear. Let's hear about how gentle he'd be with you. He would just use you like a little piece of trash. I bet you know all about men. Don't you, little girl? - Lay off the kid. - Sure, ain't no business of mine. But I'll tell you one thing. He comes near me, and I'll kill him. [dramatic orchestral music] [beeping] - [Computer] Incoming communication. - Nile. - Yeah? - [Austin] We've got trouble. - [Nile] Be right there. [sighing] What is it, Austin? - There was total silence, then suddenly I pick up a distress beacon. And then, this. - [Man] No, no, no, please, no please. [sobbing] - Jesus. Do you have a fix? - Yeah, um, the beacon originates from here, about 500 yards in. - [Computer] Verifying location. - It's deep. I don't like it. - It could be a trap. It could be anything. - [Man] No, no, no! [sobbing] - Have the others meet me in the airlock. - Aye aye. [suspenseful orchestral music] - Okay, listen up. Getting out of this hell hole is our first priority. But if there are still people alive back there, it's our duty to try and bring them here. - Your duty is to this ship and to this crew. You're gonna risk our lives for a bunch of inmates? That sucks, Nile. - You know, you've got two choices. You can keep your mouth shut and do your job, or you can spend the rest of the trip in the brig. Now what's it gonna be? - All right, Cap, you've made your point. - Inoculations, Captain. - How long will this give us? - Less than an hour. - All right, let's move out. We need to locate the beacon, find any survivors, and get the hell out of here. Can you hold down the fort? - Got it, Captain. - The sooner we get this over with, the better. [beeping] - It's close, 100 yards. [beeping] [thumping] [footsteps thudding] - [Nile] Helena, come on. Stay with me. [footsteps thudding] - [Austin] This is it. This just keeps getting better and better. - [Nile] Zip it. - [Sheridan] Uh-oh. This is blood. Holy mother-- - Oh, Christ. - This was it. - Oh, Jesus Christ. These men were butchered minutes ago. [footsteps thudding] - Looks like a code key, controls access to the computer. There's nothing we can do with it now. - Screw the disk. Let's move. - Yeah, we're outta here. Alexandria, this is Nile. Alexandria do you copy? Lincoln, do you read me? [screaming] Lincoln, come in. We're coming back in. Lincoln, do you copy? Lincoln, respond. Copy? [screaming] Lincoln, if you're receiving me, we're coming back in. [suspenseful orchestral music] [choking] - It's been closed? - [Austin] Somebody else has been through here. - Hey, where's Helena? - Helena, come in. Helena, do you copy? Helena, respond. Helena? Helena? - It's locked. I can jimmy it through the panel. It'll take 10 minutes. - No, we don't have the time. Sheridan, take my lead. [guns firing] [suspenseful orchestral music] Helena, come in. Alexandria, come in. Lincoln, answer me. [voice garbling] [gasping] [screaming] [suspenseful orchestral music] - It's open? What the hell. [sobbing] If anyone's on board, they're not leaving. - [Nile] Sheridan, stay with us. Stay with us. We need you. - She needed me! [sobbing] - All right, so we move out from here, and we find him. - And we kill him! [sobbing] - [Computer] Satcom initiating scanning. - Austin, anything on satcom? - Yeah, I boosted the commlink level through the roof. I can scan the ship and locate any sound sources. - You can hear him moving. - I'll be able to hear him breathing. - Let's move out. [suspenseful orchestral music] Austin, talk to me. - [Austin] Bridge is nothing. Quarters, nothing. Engineering, nothing. Wait-- - What is it? - [Austin] You see that coming right at you. - No, I don't see, on your knees! - We're coming to you, Nile. I'm on my way. - You have to listen to me. - Don't let that bastard-- - Sheridan, no! - He's mine! - Sheridan, stand down. That's an order. - Don't even sweat. - What have you done with Helena? - I don't even know who that is. I was following him, but I was too late. The airlock was already open, and I found a dead woman. I knew how it would look to you if you saw me over her. - Don't look much different now. - I can prove who I am. - And who are you? - I am Mannix, detention officer guard, record number nine, one, 43, eight, seven, two. - [Computer] Scanning file, please wait. - I had been on a repair detail, riding the lines for the automated tillers. The killing had already started by the time I got back. You can't imagine, blood, little pieces, bodies, carnage, cost, for that bastard. - Yeah, we got the picture. - Not human, you saw him. Couldn't you tell? He killed them, killed every one of them. - This sounds familiar. - I knew it was just a matter of time 'til they got to me, so I tried to get him outside. Hell, I have spent half my God-damn life on a construction rig. Nobody's better out there than me. I knew I could take him. I was doing good, 'til you people showed up. And you saved him. - [Austin] Here it comes. - [Computer] File located. - It's coming up. He is who he says he is. - You're gonna love him, when he comes for ya. - Officer Mannix-- - Are you listening to me? What's the matter with you? It's right there in front of your face. That man, that thing, is too dangerous to leave. Outside I could take him. And I swear to you, if you leave him out there on his own, he's gonna kill every single one of you. He's gonna kill everything. Let me out of here! - Here it is. We've got one dead crew member, and one missing, and one or both of these men is a killer. - What about Helena? - Face it, she's dead. And we're all gonna end up like her and Lincoln if we don't get off of this ship. - That's enough! That's enough, enough! This is a story. It is not our job to fight this thing, and I am not gonna lose any more of you. We're gonna prep for takeoff, and we're gonna use the time to scan for Helena. And nobody, but nobody leaves this ship. Clear? - [Computer] Scanning base sectors now. - So how close are we cutting it? - Nearest mapped outpost is Vega 17, about 14 clicks. It'll take us about 30 hours, as long as we have the juice to keep her in hyperdrive. - Come on, Helena. Where the hell are you? - This guy, that guy, it doesn't make any difference. We can't trust either one of them. You still pissed at me? Hey, I'm the only one telling you the truth. Nile doesn't give a damn. Do you think she cares about us? No way, she's risking our lives out there, while some bastard is in here carving up Lincoln and Helena. Are you listening to me? - No. - Linc, Nile doesn't care. Sure, she helped you out, but that's just window dressing. She's gotta have a death wish, and Austin just goes along with her. If one more thing goes wrong-- - Any more food? - Just look at him. He isn't worried about anything. He ate like a horse, because he's the one. - And? - And I think we should take him out now. Just get it over with. Just take your gun and do what you do best. - First we, then me. - Just think what he did to Lincoln. - [Computer] C-deck, status normal. - The C-deck checks out, everything locked down. I just want to zero out the airlock before we move. - Affirmative. - [Austin] Any luck? - Not yet. - [Computer] Scanning base sector five. - I'm working on it. - Sleeping like a baby, because he isn't worried. Because he's our guy. - Reno, I don't know that you're wrong, but that ain't enough. - You wanna wait 'til he's slitting our throats? [scoffing] Look, I can't do this on my own. I need you to back me up. - No, you don't. You just can't do it. I don't know why you think I can. - I can't? Well, we'll just see. Won't we? [sighing] - Not so easy, huh? [screaming] Drop it. Damn it, or I'll blow your foul head off. - Sheridan-- - Don't be stupid. [suspenseful orchestral music] [gasping] You should thank me. [gun firing] [electricity crackling] - Nile, the bastard got away, and he's armed. - Damn it. - [Computer] Intership scanning off. - He's heading for the airlock. Austin, come in. - What is it? What's going on? - He's making a break for it, heading your way. Are you armed? - No. - [Nile] Then just let him go. Get out of there. - Copy that. [screaming] - Austin? [grunting] Austin? [grunting] [grunting] - You son of a bitch. [screaming] [grunting] - [Computer] Emergency purge, decontamination protocol. Warning, clear airlock. Airlock decontaminated. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - [Nile] Good. - Doesn't make much sense, does it? - [Nile] No, it doesn't. - [Austin] How are we looking? - We're almost ready. No Helena, we're gonna have to lift off without her. When we get within shouting distance of Vega 17, we'll call in the cavalry. Any problems? - None from me. - Everything is in the green. - Engines engaged, maneuvering power standing by. - Goodbye and good riddance. [light orchestral music] - [Vigo] Vigo calling Alexandria. God, please don't leave me here. Life support system has failed. Toxicity is 90%. Nile, don't leave me. - Christ, he's got Helena. - [Vigo] Shields are up. You'll never make it. - Austin? - I can't can get a reading on the defense screen one way or the other way, but that's the way it's designed. It's invisible to most sensors. - Damn. - [Vigo] I know you're receiving me. Please, be smart. - Could he have activated the shield? What'll happen if we hit it? - It'll blow this can to pieces. - Come on, I found her in the ruins. She needs help, and I'm not sure I can make it. You've gotta trust me about the shields. - We can't just leave Helena. - I'm holding her steady. - Well, he's not lying about the toxics. His vital signs are all over the place. - Good, let him die. - And Helena? - On the edge. - What about the shield? - Nile, I'm begging you. You're never gonna make it. - I'm setting her down. - [Computer] Reverse thrust. - Vigo, we're picking you up. - I copy. I copy. [groaning] - [Computer] Airlock manual override. - Negative airlock, we got a manual override. - What? Where's Reno? - [Computer] Airlock deactivated. - [Austin] You're too late. - I better not be, or I'll see you tried for murder when we get home. - If we get home. - Is she still alive? - She's dead. - He's still breathing. - Take him to sickbay. - What for? They're dead. [grunting] - Great. [sobbing] - Why don't we just shoot them both and get the hell out of here? - And you, too, while we're at it. - Sheridan? - I don't like it. - If I find out he's the one, there ain't nothing that's gonna keep me from him. - You and me both. - This doesn't concern you, Reno. - This concerns all of us. I seem to be the only one who remembers that around here. - Concern right now is for the shield. - I could rig a probe, use a remote sled and a couple of boosters. - How long will it take? - Two hours, tops. - Get on it. [door whooshing] [dramatic electronic music] - [Computer] Scanning files. - Austin, I really don't think it's gonna work. Completely and totally unusable. - [Reno] Ugh, don't use that. - Stop, Reno, okay? If you knew so damn well, shut the hell up. Shut up. - [Reno] You shut up. - Hey. [static hissing] - Can't let him go. One, six, two is not a human. [shouting] - [Austin] Nile, come in. Probe's ready. - Affirmative. - Okay, it's not fancy, but it'll go up and keep going. - Let's do it. [dramatic orchestral music] - [Computer] Probe is prepared for launch. Launch in eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. [grand orchestral music] Probe is launched, vector nominal. [explosion booming] Probe destroyed. - Well, at least we know he wasn't lying about the shield. - That doesn't mean anything. He could've activated it himself. - Reno and Sheridan, secure the bay doors. - Aye aye, Cap. [door whooshing] - You're gonna leave the two of them alone again? - I need to talk to you. Come with me. [dramatic electronic music] All the files in the system have been accessed recently. I can't tell if they've been studied or modified, but they're the only uncoded files in the system. So somebody either wanted to hide them or make them easy to find. - And 762? - Fact, legend, I, I don't know, but the prisoners treated him like some kind of god. Supposedly he started the riot. - So there was a riot? - Bad, over 100 prisoners killed, and guards. They just went after each other with anything they could find that would cut, spikes, broken glass, anything. - Oh, Jesus. - Most of the bodies were too mutilated to identify. That must have been how they missed him. They shut off life-support systems after 40 hours. And the prisoners, it's sure, they tore each other apart. - So now we're back to his story. Well, what about, uh, what about the number? 762, what does that mean? - There's something there. - [Computer] Retrieving file transmission. - Can't let him fool you. 762 is not a human being. Oh, maybe once upon a time, hundreds of years ago, when convicts still wore numbers, it was. But not anymore. 762, it's death itself. It's a disease that feeds on murder and kills everything around it. Then it dies. Only to be reborn worse, because each time that it comes back it's stronger. It's hungrier. We must continue the hunt, so that the killing will continue as the killing has continued, as the killing will continue. Until every single human thing is dead. Maybe all we can know about it is that it marks its territory and marks itself. This time 762 has come back-- [static hissing] - [Computer] End transmission. - [Nile] 10 CC's, this should bring him around. - You think he knows? - Maybe. - Yeah, I'm a liar, a liar and a thief. That's what I'm doing here. - [Nile] So now you're telling me you're an inmate? - Yeah, but he's 1,000 times worse. - When you left, where did you go and why? - To find him. - The 762? - Yeah, you have no idea what I've seen. - Reno. - I've seen men blind themselves so they didn't have to see him, slit their own throats to deny him the pleasure. Maybe they thought they forgot about fear long before they reached this hellish rock. Do you know who I am? I'm the one that stands between you and his knife. - What about the shield? - It can only be operated from the main control room, and it cannot be deactivated remotely. And I'm the only one who knows where it is. - Austin? - The projector is too heavily shielded. I can't get a fix on it. - Then we have no alternative. - We have to go back in. [suspenseful orchestral music] - Where's mine? - You gotta be kidding me. - Hey, let's get something straight. You are not a part of my crew. Your only job is to show us where the main control room is. [door whooshing] What is it? - He's watching me. - Let's keep moving. - We gotta keep an eye on that bastard. Don't you stop thinking about Lincoln. You hear me? [intense music] [screaming] [grunting] [gasping] [grunting] [dramatic orchestral music] - 762, it's death. [screaming] [gun firing] [screaming] - Hey. - [Sheridan] No more, no more-- - [Nile] What are you doing? - No more, no more. - [Nile] Take the weapon. - No more. - [Nile] Okay, Sheridan. - [Austin] Watch him. - Sheridan, Sheridan, can you go back to the ship? - [Sheridan] No more, no more, no more. - Everything's gonna be okay. Sheridan? Sheridan, you go back to the ship, and we're gonna be there as soon as we can. It's gonna be okay. Just go back to the ship. We'll be right there. We're gonna be right back. Move! Sheridan, get going. [dramatic orchestral music] [breathing heavily] [chanting] - Master control is right up ahead. Power levels indicate in-computer activity. - Think he's in there? - [Austin] Even money. - That's good enough for me. - Okay, listen up everyone, alive if possible, but don't take any chances. Shield is our first priority. Austin, you go around. I'll join you. You two, cover him here. Go. - Don't you move. I'll kill you. I swear I'll kill you. - You shoot me, and you'll alert him. - I can make the shot. [grunting] [guns firing] [suspenseful orchestral music] [gun clicking] [gun firing] [screaming] [groaning] [grunting] [groaning] - Men. - Is this the one? [beeping] - Do you hear that? - No, yes. [suspenseful orchestral music] It's rigged to blow. [explosion booming] [grunting] - [Austin] Nile, look. - [Nile] Shit, where's Vigo? [suspenseful orchestral music] - Poor kid. [sighing] Shield control is pretty much blown away. I can hard-pass the deactivation. - How long? - 10 minutes, the shield will stay down for at least two hours, even if somebody tries to bring it back online. - Good. [gun cocking] [voice garbling] [growling] [grunting] [groaning] [laughing] [screaming] [static hissing] - Think I've got it. [beeping] Shield's down. - Let's go. [suspenseful orchestral music] - Open, somebody beat us here, huh? - He's in the ship. - After you. Nile, look out. - [Computer] Emergency purge, matter decontamination. Warning. - [Nile] Austin. - Nile. Help. - [Nile] Try the other side. Get out of there! - Help. Nile! [coughing] Help me, help me, Nile, just go. Just go. Just go. [coughing] Just go. Nile, just go. Just go. Go. Go. [coughing] - [Nile] No! - [Computer] Decontamination complete. - [Nile] Austin, no! [sobbing] No! [grunting] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Shoot us both. [grunting] [beeping] [screaming] [explosion booming] [grunting] [groaning] [grunting] [electricity crackling] [suspenseful orchestral music] [screaming] [gun firing] [dramatic orchestral music] It's over. [dramatic orchestral music] - I'll be back. [dramatic electronic music] - [Computer] Takeoff procedure initiated. [grunting] - So do you think he's really a killer? He's really really handsome, though, isn't he? I mean, can't you just imagine what he'd be like? - 762, he's the killer. He killed all of 'em. [gun firing] - [Mannix] You're mine! [breathing heavily] - [Reno] These men were butchered minutes ago. - [Austin] That's a lot of blood. - This guy's not even human. Please don't leave me here. God no, don't leave me. - Good, let him die. - Blood, little pieces. Are you listening to me? 762, it's death, to listen to me. - [Sheridan] Imagine what he'd be like, what he'd be like, imagine what he'd be like. - [Mannix] It's a disease. - [Nile] She's still alive. - [Austin] He's still breathing. She's dead. That sounds familiar. [grunting] Just go. - Austin, no. [door whooshing] [dramatic orchestral music] Looks worse than it is. [moaning] [grunting] [moaning] [grunting] [moaning] [ominous orchestral music] [coughing] - You okay in there? - [Nile] Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. [door whooshing] - I'm hungry. Thank you. I didn't realize I was so hungry. It's funny how you can just forget something like that. I mean, I guess it's good being so wrapped up in your work that you forget everything else. It's not like we were working. More, please. What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Hey, Nile, [suspenseful orchestral music] [gun firing] [grunting] Nile, oh, Nile! Nile! Where are you, sweetheart? [electricity crackling] [yelling] - [Computer] Receiving incoming communication. - Where the hell have you gone, huh? [grunting] [laughing] [beeping] - Come on, please. [laughing] - [Computer] Error in decoded message. Please re-enter access code. [beeping] - This is Captain Myra Nile of the Alexandria. Please respond. - [Man] Message clear, Captain Nile. What can I do for you? - We have a priority one emergency. We have six fatalities and a hostile on board. - [Man] What the hell is going on down there? - My life is in danger. Can you intercept? - [Man] Sit tight, Captain Nile. I'll be there in 30 seconds. - 30 seconds? - [Man] That's what I said. 30 seconds. - What's your position? - About six o'clock, darling. [suspenseful orchestral music] [grunting] - So kill me. - Oh, I'm planning on it. But why rush? We've got all the time in the world. - So tell me something. Are you doing all this because you're so lousy in bed? [grunting] [gun firing] [grunting] - It's too late. So drop the gun, or I'll cut her left eye out. [whimpering] - Bang. [grunting] [breathing heavily] [grunting] [suspenseful orchestral music] [grunting] [grunting] [Vigo laughing] [grunting] [gun firing] [dramatic orchestral music] [grunting] [beeping] - [Vigo] Die, you bastard. [screaming] [groaning] [screaming] [explosion booming] [dramatic orchestral music] - [Nile] Can you get up? - Almost. - I owe you an apology. - And I would settle for some medical attention. - Okay. [suspenseful orchestral music] [static hissing] - We know all we can. We know it marks its territory, and then it marks itself. This time 762 came back as your friend, as your lover, as your child, as me. It came back as you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you.
