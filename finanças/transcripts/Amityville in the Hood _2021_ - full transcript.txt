Get back here! This house is fucking blessed. What happened? What's going on? Let's get out of here. In the name of Satan, ruler of the Earth, king of the world, I command you sow your infernal power on me. Open wide the gates of Hell, and come forth to greet me as a brother and friend. In your name, I ask that you curse this devil for us, placing your only attack on it, possess the souls of those who assume. Oh, hear thy names, Yorthog, Behemoth, Anuk, Belial, render me the indulgences that I speak. Keep this Amityville curse alive and keep the world hold over it. I command you, I command you. So it is done. It's in here. Follow me. Oh, hell no. This place is spooky as fuck. Ay, ain't this where that crazy ass white kid killed his whole family? Nigga, you better get your ass up in this motherfucking house. Mucking around with my fucking time and shit. Shit. Goddamn, that's a group of motherfucking weed. Shut the fuck up, stupid.

Yo, yo, what you doing here all dressed up like that? Like motherfucking Little Mermaid and shit. Oh, you must be new. I'm Cheyenne. Your motherfucking boss called my boss to come over to here to this dump of a club to give him an hour of tug and chug, if you know what I mean, Mongo, mmhmm. Mongo? My name's Rosco, okay? Rosco. Rosco, Mongo, Yolo, whatevers. Look, can we make this quick? 'Cause I just got stiffed on my last job. I gotta say something. You're looking pretty fine in a whole kind of way, I'll tell ya.

I figures, since you driving and I just gave you $20, after our little slurp off you give me, you go drop me off at my parents' house. It's only in Compton, it's not far away, so maybe you could give me a little ride. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You want me to blow you and then give you a ride to your parents' house for $20? Bitch, it's a motherfucking condo, okay? Get it right. Look, it's 20 American dollars, okay? That's 20. What you're doing to that lollipop, love, that's worth 10, the most. 10. Shit.

I'm a man of certain tastes. I'm a man who always expect things done at a certain caliber, a certain level of prestige. Ah, pardon me, gentlemen. Okay, that's enough, Cheyenne. What can I say, boys? She's really bad at sucking dick. Now, I wanna know what happened to that weed I sent you to New York to bring back for me. Where is it? And who in your little posse is trying to sell my weed in my fucking neighborhood behind my motherfucking back? No, no, no. I ain't trying to sell shit. Alright, Big M?

Hello, I'm Peter Sommers with another 90 second news update. It seems a new strain of extremely potent marijuana has hit the streets, seemingly overnight, in the city of Compton. The yet unidentified strain of cannabis is certainly causing a wave of hysteria, followed by an incurable neurosis that results in increasingly violent acts perpetrated upon oneself and others around you. Random attacks on pedestrians have been reported throughout the Los Angeles county area, with most originating in and around the city of Compton. Officials have traced this particular strain of cannabis to a supply that originated in Amityville, New York. The strain now being appropriately dubbed "Amityville Possession," playing on the area's unique and somewhat sordid history. We will continue to monitor the story and keep you updated as authorities continue to make arrests and gain control of this bizarre and somewhat dangerous outbreak. More news as we have it. Matt? Yeah. Detective White speaking. Hey, hello, Detective. Yeah, look, I know it's, uh, early in your neck of the woods. Sorry to bother you at this hour. This is Police Chief Malone. I'm calling from Amityville. Amityville, New York. Yeah, I was wondering, uh, did you happen to catch the morning news? There's some interesting developments in your area. There's a strain of marijuana and it's called Amityville Possession. Does that ring a bell? Uh, yeah, I just heard something on the news about, uh, violence, psychosis, and hysteria? Yeah, I wish it was that easy, Detective. Actually, we've had a dozen murders in the last six hours in Compton alone. Normally that wouldn't cause an alarm as it's a violent high crime city, but it's the nature of these murders. Yeah, these murders aren't your, uh, typical gangbang drive-by bullshit. These murders they're sadistic, vile, almost demonic. A few hours ago, we went to a call where a woman put her newborn in a toaster oven and then served it to her 12-year-old fucking son. We're opening up an investigation to pinpoint the exact location of this goddamn devil harvest so we can send it back to Hell where it belongs. So how far from Amityville are you? I'm sorry, did you say Amityville? Where all those murders took place? The painting, the toy monkey? That Amityville? Yes. That Amityville. We have reason to believe that this strain is coming from that house in particular. You know what? Get a gallon of gasoline and torch the damn place. Well, if it was up to me, that place would be a steaming pile of rubble years ago. Here comes the "but." Well, there is a but. We can't get a search warrant legally to search the place if we don't have probable cause. And now that the bank owns the place, I'll be honest with you, they're a stickler for the rules so I think they would frown upon arson, you know, being the tight asses they are. So what do you want with me? Well, since you live in the area, I was kind of hoping you'd do a little investigating for us. What do you think, you in? I'm listening. Yeah, we were just sent out on a death notification of two local gangbangers. They were both shot and found dead at that Amityville location. We got some local witnesses that say they saw four males leaving the residence with what appeared to be large bags. But we did a little digging ourselves. We traced the bullets from the homicide back to an address in your location. A location that had a multiple homicide this morning. And there was only one survivor and her name was Sondra LaCosta. Jesus. Yeah, we were sort of hoping that maybe you could, uh, go over there and ask her a few questions and get some answers for us and then maybe we could search that house. Burn it to the fucking ground. Well, at least find the plants and destroy them. But you never know, accidents happen. So, uh, what do you say? You in? Detective. Hey, hello? You still there? Yes. Yes, yeah, I'm sure I can handle that. Just send me the address and I'll get over there as soon as I can. Sure thing. I'll get them right over to you. Hey, thank you, I really appreciate this. I guess I better get going on this. Yeah, man. Yo, so check this out, Big M. That shit getting crazy, man. The weed that we're supposed to bring back for you- - My weed? Yeah, yeah, yeah, your, your weed, man. So check this shit out. That bitch going crazy, man. It's like it made her fucking nuts. Like PCP mixed with the bath salts, man. Bitch climbing up a phone pole, naked, screaming out. This fucking mama's crazy, man. Rosco is fucking dead and I- You listen to me. And you listen to me good. You know what that is right there? That right there is money in the motherfucking bank, you dumb ass little piece of shit. Controversy, a story, a little hype? You know, people love a good story. You know what happened when motherfuckers back in Chicago started overdosing on heroin two years back? That shit went up nearly tenfold. Nearly ten fucking fold, you believe that shit? And, yeah, motherfuckers will die here and there, but that's the hazard of the trade. You'll get that. But the fucking dealers are rolling and motherfucking dealing. All because of a little controversy, a little hype, a little fucking story. Sweet cheeks, I want you to round up the boys, get the rest of that Amityville shit, and get out there on those streets. And tell to fuck that shit up a whole fucking Benjamin and start selling that shit to every man, woman, and motherfucking child they see. You got it? Get it. DeShawn, I'm gonna give you one more fucking chance. But if you fuck with me, I promise you, I'll splatter your brains all over the fucking street. Get the fucking car. I think it's time Big M takes a trip to Amityville. Take a hit, dude. It's just that new shit I was telling you about. Right, this is it, you're saving for me? You smoked it all. Oh, man. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? The fuck you talking about? This shit gets you high. The fuck? Holy shit. Yeah, you're just tripping, man. Am I tripping? What the fuck is that? Yo, it's this fucking weed, man. Like, literally, it's the weed. Holy fucking shit. Barb wire, Compton, incredible. I can't believe they want me to do this. Getting ready to do this interview with barb wire. Incredible. Sondra LaCosta? I am, yeah. Who are you? Oh, sorry, I'm Detective White. Come in. I don't mean to bother you, especially at a time like this, but I've been assigned your case. My case? My case? Okay, look, Detective, I know why you're here. I really, really do, but you might wanna choose your words a little more carefully because it's not just my case, alright? It was my sister's case. She was fucking murdered, okay? Murdered. And she fucking... She, she killed... She killed them all. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be insensitive. I know how confusing this can really be, more than most people actually. Believe me, I really do. How could you possibly? Because, Sondra, I've seen the devil too. I don't even know where to start. Tell me everything, okay? I wanna know it all. I don't give a shit how much it hurts, okay? Just tell me everything, please. Have you ever seen that woman? No, I don't think so. She was all over the news a few years ago. It all started in a little town called Amityville. After he killed his whole family, the items inside the home were later auctioned off. A lamp, a mirror, a dollhouse, a painting, and finally a toy monkey. This woman in the photo, her name is Julia. She ended up with the toy monkey. She took it back with her to a family reunion in Nebraska. Wow. Mom, would you look at this? It is. This looks like, just like the one I had when I was a kid. Mmhmm. Where did you find this? At an old antique store back home. I saw it and I remembered you said you had one when you were little, so I figured you'd like it. Like it? I love it, dear. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Brown-noser. Wind it up. Alright. Sorry, I didn't think to check to make sure if it actually worked. It's alright, let me take a look at it. Who is it? Who's there? Carol. Stop me, Daddy. Take it, you little bitch. Harder. Take it. Harder! Stop me, Daddy. Dad? Oh my God. What have you done? Oh, no, no, no. Oh my god. I think the baby's coming. This is where I come in. This is the one. Are you serious? That thing gives me the creeps. Anything I can help you two with? How much for the monkey? Ah, the monkey. Certainly, it's one of a kind. You know, they don't make these anymore. I know. It's exactly like the one I had as a kid. Honey, are you sure you wouldn't rather get that new PS4 game instead? No way, this is perfect. I can't guarantee that it works. Well, that's alright, I don't mind. I'm great with my hands. I'm sure I could fix him up. How much did you say he was? $50. $50. What? Sold. Babe, no. 50 bucks, really? These guys go for way more money. He is so worth it. Let me get you a receipt. I won't be needing one. I'm keeping him. You see, they were right. The monkey was possessed, just like everything else that comes out of that godforsaken wretched place. There you are. Sarah, I found it. I found it. Grab Guy and let's get the fuck outta here. What the fuck? Let's have some fun, lover. You know what fun is? My god. Fun is where I eat your fucking heart out of your chest. One by one, they were individually murdered. Brutally murdered. Jake. Listen, Mr. Jansen, I don't wanna hear it. If you have a problem, Mr. Jansen- Do it. Salem, do it, shoot her now. Do it now, Salem. Shoot, shoot, shoot, do it, do it. Did you hear that? Dad? Did you hear that? Oh my God, is that what I think it is? Yes. - What the fuck? - Oh my god. - What is he doing? - What the fuck is he doing? I don't know this... Dad. - Oh my God. - Oh my God! Do it. Kill them. Hold your chin up. Shoot them, you pussy, kill them. Pull the trigger. Daddy? There was one lone survivor. I lived back in that area then. I was the one who found the bodies and I was the one who helped to get Julia committed. It was my testimony that got her locked away. You're in grave danger. What do you mean? You have the monkey, don't you? How did you know about that? That's the only reason why you'd be here. It's evil, isn't it? It's more than just evil. It's the vessel for which evil transfers between physical locations spreading all over like, like a plague. It all began back in Amityville. It's my fault. My father killed my entire family. I purchased that monkey from a Amityville antique shop as a present for his 50th birthday. There's been murders connected to that house every few years for the past several decades. Lamps and clocks and mirrors and even a dollhouse from that evil place have all been present during several copycat killings in the '90s. I think I remember reading about some of those. Weren't there some movies made or something? Hollywood loves to exploit what makes money. Maybe, maybe I'll even sell my story for a made-for-TV movie. You can't stop evil. You'll only ward it off. Evil never dies. You see, she was right. It was the monkey all along. And it's my fault that she died all alone in that godforsaken asylum. You know something about that place, don't you, Sondra? About Amityville. Yes, Detective, I... You see, I pay attention. And most people think that I'm just some good girl, but I watch and I listen and I pay attention. And my sister is fucking dead because some wannabe ass thug took some weed off Big M, okay? And they said it was from some place. From Amityville. Yes, and there's something about it that is evil, okay? When Heather smoked it, she became somebody else, something else. I need you to make a statement that says you know that he got those drugs from that house so the authorities back there can go in there and search and destroy the extra harvest. Okay, that's great, but what about everything on the street? There's not a whole hell of a lot we can do about that right now. We just gotta pray to God that it's all smoked and no one has tried to clone it or plant the rest of it. Thank you, Sondra. I promise you, I will do everything within my power to make sure that your sister rests in peace. I'll be in touch. You stay safe, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Fuck. Fuck, damn flies. Fuck it, ugh. I will do whatever I need to do to end this evil. I will. This can't go on. We're gonna burn that fucking house down. You can count on it. What's this guy? 12th Precinct, Police Chief Malone here. Malone. Yeah, I'm glad I got you. Yeah, I interviewed that young lady this afternoon. Sondra? I got her statement and everything. Really nice kid. Great. Send that fucker over. You alright, Malone? You sound, I don't know, a little shaky, to tell you the truth. Have you been out there lately? People are killing each other left and fucking right. It's a bloody massacre out there. It's the human fucking condition. That's the way it's always been. Man taking advantage of man, survival of the fittest, apex predator bullshit. Come on. Come on, Malone, I need you to keep yourself together. You're the only one I have left out here and that's on my side. Yeah, well, I got some bad news for you. It's dead. The Amityville investigation's kaput, down the toilet, gone. What? Why? This decision came from the top, way up the top. They said we didn't have enough information. What about the- - Even with the statement, not enough. This town is full of devils and ghosts, Detective. Most people here, well, they just forget it ever happened. One sec, I gotta take a look at this. Detective? Hey, you there? Sondra LaCosta has been found dead in her apartment. They gotta be stopped, Malone. A fire has ignited. What are you? That fucking house, it's gotta be stopped. That kid I interviewed today, Sondra, she's dead. What the fuck? Yeah, dead. Just like everyone else here who became connected with that godawful place. I don't care what it takes, Malone. You better hear me. I'm on the next red-eye out of LAX. I thought I'd never, ever be saying these words again in my entire life. I'm on my way back to fucking Amityville. So this is the rotten piece of shit I been hearing so much about? Let's just get the green and get the fuck up outta here. What I fucking say, motherfucker? What I fucking say? This place is a fucking goldmine. This is gonna be our main spot from now on. What the fuck are you waiting on? Put that shit in some bags and get the fuck up outta here. What the fuck, dude? Don't be a fucking pussy, it's just the wind. Hey, Malone, you crazy son of a bitch, don't do anything stupid. Rock and roll, motherfucker. Come on, come on, what are you doing? Jesus, shit. Come on. Big M? Hey, man, you okay? Yo, I said, are you okay, man? You know what, DeShawn? I think I'm gonna start to like it here. Hey, you sure you're okay? Home sweet home. This is for you, Julia. Rah! Do it, Detective. Do it now. Good riddance, let's get ourselves some more. Hey, can we score some of that Amityville Possession weed?
