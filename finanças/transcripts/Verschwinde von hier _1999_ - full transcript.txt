You still don't know who's the father of the baby? Tomorrow 8:00 sharp Janna starts working in my shop. 17 years, no graduation, a baby to take care of, partying all nights... This has to end now. Lucas... I have to leave. I can't stand it here. But I'll come back and get you out of here someday, ok? No, please not. Lucas, don't worry now. You have been really brave for the last half year. Lucas! Stop maddening the animals. You are driving away all my customers. Go to the back where no one can see you. Hey sweetie I am your mom... For 5 years I had to cope with his illness. You can't just take him away now, he doesn't even know you. Did you really think, I would leave him with someone like you forever? - I have work now. And a man. -Hi Lucas, sweetie. This is Janosh. The three of us are going to a big city now. Gran. Stop it. I can't be late again. See you guys. Janosh is hungry. Janosh is going to eat a nice young boy now. Oh shit. Rule No. 1: A real man doesn't show any fear. Regardless of how scared he is. Rule No 2: We only battle for women. And for nothing else. Have your breakfast! Fuck, how did they wrap you up? Have you been to Alcatraz? Oh shit. Damn. This terrible old lady. What did she do to you? Go ahead! What are you waiting for? - Tough guy or chicken? - Tough guy. - So go ahead. - One - One - Two - Two So, let's celebrate, only the two of us. There's nothing to it. Unfortunately. But look there. Maybe there at the top. Great. That's what we wanted. - Once more: What is this? - An alligator from America. - And what does this alligator do? - It protects me. - And what else? - Squeaking. - And when does it squeak? - When I need the lavatory. - And when else? - Only when I have to got the toilet. A budgie, a green budgie Now a canary, please A canary. I'm dying - What are you doing there? - I make your mother happy. - I want that too - Ok you stick 3 papers together... ... then take some shit and warm it up over the candle. But don't burn it! Burning destroys it. When it's warm, crumble and mix it with tobacco. Then you roll a big fat joint. - Are you crazy, asshole? What are you doing? He's 5 years old. You want him to become a junkie with 10? He's 5 years old. And he's my son. Calm down babe. I was just joking. This won't happen again. No dope in front of the boy from now on. Look this way. Wave your hand. - All the best for your 6th birthday sweetie. - One, Two, Three, Feet up. Janna. Janna, what happened? You really should stop smoking that stuff. If you get caught, they will fire you. Ok, let me also take a pull. What's wrong babe? I can tell that something's wrong. And I think I know what you need. I'm pregnant. He took everything. Fuck! All the money. What am I supposed to do now? Bastard! - Gone. - What is he doing? - I don't know. - As always. Screwing things up. - Will he be back? I will be late again. Do you think you can stay on your own for one day? - C'mon Janna. Let's go. - The boy is not answering - He will be out. Home alone for the whole week... Even me couldn't stand that. - You should bring him somewhere. - But if Janosch comes back? - Then you throw him out. You deserve better. - My mom used to say that - Get in the car babe. - Where have you been? - Look my new hat from America. - Where do you got the car? For fuck's sake! You paid with the money you stole from me? Ladies and Gentlemen. Please have mercy with a lost soul and his desperate son. This is the one. Life is empty and sad without her. Please get in the car sweetie. Janna, please come with us. Why do you let your child beg like this. Idiot! Damn it, bring him home. Please Lucas. Tell Janosch to come home.

The boy's a natural. It's home time friends! - No no. It's your money - Really? - You're a quick learner - You see the ship over there? - Yes Someday when we earned enough money, we will go with one of these to America. - Where the alligators live? - Yes Hop in. It's still a long way home. It was a great night pal. You really did me proud. - You bastard - Calm down sweetie Don't you touch me! Where have you been? I sent the boy yesterday evening! I was nearly going mad. I even called the police - The cops? Shit, please cancel the appointment. - That's not funny. Where have you been? We earned some money. Only for you! - Where did you get the money from? - Hey. We just had some harmless fun. Fun? 1000 Mark? That's not fun. What have you done to my son? Ok ok. No fun! I show you what we did. - What's that? - A brand new buggy. Hard to find one during the night... ... but you look like you could need one. Do you mean, you are happy with a second child? Only if it's a girl. A sexy one like you. You scumbag. You always talk me around. - Why is Janosch not there? - Gimme your shoes. He promised to be on time. Everyone brings his mother and father today. Hey, you don't want to be late on a day like this? So all kids have to wait for you and get angry with you.... Janosch! Hello.

Are you sleeping? Janna. Janna Help! Help! Help! Open the door! Please Janna, say something. Let's get out of here. I won't ever hurt you again. I do whatever you want. Please say something. He won't be back, Lucas. Not this time. - Call grandma. - No, not grandma. Should I look for Janosch? I will bring back Janosch... Stop it. I don't want to see this scumbag again, never.

Janna is sleeping! Back off or be quiet! Lara? Lucas. Lucas come playing. This way. Captain Spider has no mercy. Come on you hack. Faster. Once more... Once more... Janna, when you're done with washing: Give the floor a sweep and clean the sink before you go. - Ouch. That hurts. - Miss! The drier is way too hot. That's not my responsibility. Styling is done by Petra. Jana, turn down the drier immediately. Petra has a break. And when you're back from the laundry, sort and shelve the new goods. Just stay a bit longer today. My quitting time was an hour ago. I leave. No you don't. You can't leave me alone. If you go now, you will be fired.. I don't care. It's 09:30. Customers are queuing here. Tell your mother to be here in 10 minutes. Otherwise her job is over. I'm so fed up with this. Let me talk to her. - She already left. She's on her way. - 10 minutes! Jana, wake up. Wake up. Jana... - What happened? - Make coffe. Strong. - Again... - Hurry up. We have to wake her up. Jana, wake up. Jana, please. Please! Jana... Oh no. Not that again. But she loves working for you. She constantly tells us, right Babs? It would be terrible for her if she was not allowed to come anymore. Today... It's just that sometimes she does not feel so well. Then she has to do the cooking and cleaning and stuff. The whole night. And the meat yesterday smelled really bad. I also feel sick already. You eat foul meat? Sometimes. When we do not have the money for fresh meat. She promises that this will never happen again. That she will be punctual from now on and stuff... And... Please... Maybe you can consider the dismissal again, because... because... Because we have to feel the punch of hunger so often when mommy has no work. Ok ok. But I do this only because of you. Got it? - Why are you late again? - My mother is sick. - She drank again? - Stupid sod! Barbara. I told you to not use this language in my course! - Hey Boss. - Hey Matze. - Nice color. Where did you get it? - Stolen. - Cool. Kid's stuff... "A hero in my life" - Seems like that was really hard. Meyer: Wrecked directly after the introduction. Leschke: "Boris Becker"... An F - With your spelling you won't even make it a ball boy... Thomas Wieland: Obviously doesn't know any heroes. Merat Seulan: "Lady Diana"... That's not what I call novel... - Lucas Weber: Read out loud. - Me? In front of all the others? Loud? Maybe there is a small chance that your colleagues may learn a bit. Please read. "Sometimes I wake up in the night and fear that I could forget his face. He had a gold tooth shining when he laughed. As if the summer is sending a light sunbeam into the room. That's why no one noticed the winter at home. He laughed a lot about all the things no one else thought were funny. About poured milk on the kitchen floor. About mold on the wallpaper. About holey shoes in the rain. The gas bill. About Janna when she was angry. About here bandy legs. About me because I was afraid of being beaten. But no one beat me again. When he was around, I had an aligator as a friend. One like all the animals on his skin. Dragons fom far away. And we wanted to leave. With a ship. He will take me with him. That's what I am thinking about at night when I fear forgetting his face. Then I see America." Who is this man? Someone I used to know. Why does your mother never attends parents' consultation?
