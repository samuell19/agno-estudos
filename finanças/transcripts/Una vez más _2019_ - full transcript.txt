''I only remember the emotion of things, and I forget everything else''. Antonio Machado Once Again Why didn't you tell me she was so ill, mum? It all happened so fast. You wouldn't have liked to see her like that. Yeah... But I could've said good-bye. Good-byes aren't always pretty. Have you spoken to your father? No, I'll text him later. He told me things are changing and now there are lots of oportunities to... Mum... Yes? I just got here. If I'm being unbearable, it's because I'd love you to come back and to have you close by. You understand? Welcome home. So tell me about London, how is everything? You're at a new studio now, right? I spoke to your mum a few days ago but I don't remember... - Hi. You both all right? - Well... Here we are. And this handsome devil that's fast asleep? More like half-asleep. Marcos, you remember me? Yes, from the beach. That's right, we went to that beach house, very good. April. So, I'm due in seven weeks. When you're pregnant you count time in weeks. That's our thing. And how is it going? - Oh, awful. A real nightmare. - Really? And I always thought pregnancy was this lovely thing. Lovely? The morning sickness is the worst, and you can't imagine how my back is killing me. If you hadn't noticed, she's taking motherhood very seriously. I'd like to see you with two kids in your belly. - Me? - You. You'd die. I'll be your kids' auntie, but no one's mum. So you're having twins? Yeah. Well, fraternal. A boy and a girl. I had no idea. Yep. That's the good thing, it's like two birds with one stone. And are you still in that flat in La Alameda? We are, but we'd like to move. But Jose can't find any work outside telemarketing. So we're stuck there for the time being. We've got the double pushchair, two high chairs, two cots, the changing table and the car seats which are complicated enough... - We're in no place for more expenses. - Right, it's a lot. Everything they tell you doesn't even begin to describe it. But get some of it second hand, don't be silly. Yeah, well, we'll have to do something like that. I'm going to burst. Have you seen my tits? They're like balloons. And Jose is thrilled of course, he can't keep his hands off them. So you going to tell her or what? Tell me what? I don't think this is a good time. So then, when? We never see each other. Come on, tell her. What is it? She's getting married and doesn't want to tell you. No! It's not I don't want to, it's just I didn't think here... You're getting married? - Yes! - That's wonderful! - Finally, yes! - Congratulations! That's so amazing! - Thank you! - That's fantastic! Yeah. And well... After eight years together, I was ready. That's it, it was about time. And he did the whole cheesy proposal on one knee, just the way she likes. - Look at that... - And in Rome, in the middle of Dick Square... Navona! - Wow! - So... - And when's the date? - In the summer. And you can't miss mine. It's going to be a huge wedding with all the frills. Knowing you... No doubt. Start having a Pamela hat designed. That's wonderful, I'm so happy for you. I'll do whatever it takes to be there. I hope so. I'm a bundle of nerves. But very happy. And I'll be there like a whale and unable to drink a drop of alcohol. Good friends don't schedule their weddings like that, - I've got to say. - You'd expect me to wait till winter so you can look fabulous whilst I freeze to death? That would've been nice. I hope it rains. I hope the epidural doesn't work. What a bitch you can be! Do you want to feel my stomach? - Sometimes they move. - I don't know... It can seem weird, but it's really cool. I don't feel anything. Daniel... April, look. Clara... - I'm so sorry. - Thank you for coming. Come in. How are you handling it? I honestly wasn't expecting it. Yeah, that's awful. Ever since my mum called I have like... A knot in my chest that won't go away. Maybe crying will make it go away. I can't. Not even now, seeing her here like this, so peaceful, surrounded by flowers. Does that make me a bad granddaughter? Don't be silly. Everyone needs to mourn in their own way. I really don't feel like talking to anyone here. I wish... disappear. So disappear. As if that were easy with the house full of people. Look... you probably don't know half of these people. Come on. Let's go for a walk. It'll be good for you to get outside, away from all this for a bit... Trust on me. To fly little birds to the sea. Thanks. What for? For getting you out of there? For coming. It's been a long time. Yeap. It's weird... this. What? Going for a walk? Maybe. The truth is, I wasn't sure you were going to come. If I'd known, I would've brought your things. My things? You still have them or what? I dunno, I thought that, after last time, you would've thrown them out or burnt them or something. Why would I do that? They're your things. That's why. It doesn't matter. It's just a couple of CDs and a few books. Something like that. If you want I'll send them by post. No, keep them. That way you'll have an excuse to bring them to me in London. - Okay. - Great. It's so pretty here. It's always like this With the tourists and all. - You want to go somewhere else? - No. That's silly, not going to the prettiest places because they're full of tourists. You miss the most beautiful places. I was hoping to take a walk here. You just say that because you're never here. If you were here all the time you wouldn't like it as much. And the bars are very expensive. This is not like when you left. So it started as a substitution... And... I don't know, it's not what I studied and... And not where I thought I'd be after uni, but for what it is, it pays all right. And now I've got the hang of it and my workmates are cool, so.... So better than at the newspaper. A lot better. I'm actually glad I got sacked. Miserable people, and total exploitation. And what about you? How's London? You know, I can scarcely believe it's been five years since I left. You don't say. I heard you got into Norman Foster's studio. - That's right. - So, congrats. Thanks. What's it like? Well, it's definitely 'the' studio. There's some 800... A thousand of us working there: architects, engineers, designers, modelmakers... It's this amazingly beautiful building right on the Thames. And is he there with you the whole time or is he the typical celeb architect you never actually see? Believe it or not, I've actually seen him three or four times since I've been there. Seriously? All this time, and you've only seen Norman Foster four times? Yeah, he's pretty hard to pin down. So what are you working on? What's the current project you're designing? Sorry, I can't tell you that. It's confidential. Come on. Seriously? Seriously. Though I really don't understand why. It's a little project for some apple company. I don't get all the secrecy, even if it were the biggest company in the world. Well, I completely agree. There's no future in apples. I'm happy for you. London is an incredible place. There's exhibits, concerts, all sorts of shops, all kinds of people. You'd love it. Actually, I don't know how you haven't been there yet. It's like New York, but in Europe. Well, I haven't been to New York, either... Not good, Dani. Are you still hanging on to that silly fear of flying? You need to get over that, or you'll never go anywhere. I do go places. I go by train, by bus, on a bike... And when I have a good reason to take a plane, I'll take one. I've been fine like this so far. You should've come to London when they sacked you at the paper. Well... It wasn't a good time for that. Yeah. But you should've come. How long are you here for? Until tomorrow, after the burial. Quick visit. My mother wants me to stay and talk to my father, she says he knows someone who could offer me something here. Of course, my mother's crazy for me to come back. Well that's normal. But it's true that things are changing here. A lot of people have come back and found work. Shit work, but it's work. You might have some luck. Right. Shit luck, but it's luck. Back then all the bookshops were Betas, remember? - Yeah. - But now they're all these places that also have cafes and multiple floors... and each floor is something different. - Welcome to my world. - This is it? This is my theatre, and there is my audience. And there is my audience. Well, look at that. And you put on costumes? Of course. Sometimes I'm a pirate, or a clown, depending on the story. Can you guess what's the biggest hit? What? Babar. No! Oh, I've got to see you dressed up as Babar. Yeah, well... Sorry, you're too big for that. Oh, that's unfortunate. Dani! Can you come over real quick? Sure. One second. Are you available Tuesday afternoon? Tuesday... They changed the day of Sergio Hojman's book presentation so we've got an opening. Okay, sure. Put me in. - Yeah? - Yeah, go ahead. Then you're in. There you go Don't go missing on me, I can't handle those little beasts alone. - Don't worry. - 'Don't worry'... Don't know if I should trust you. You still owe me a beer from the last time. You're right, my bad. We'll have it the next day, then. All right? All right. So it'll be one, two, three, and four sessions In the afternoon, next week. Great. Everything good? Everything's great. Fantastic. Thanks. You're welcome. CHEERFUL WEATHER FOR THE WEDDING Look, I was thinking of giving this to Ana as a wedding gift. Do you know it? 'England, in the 1930s. Dolly is about to get married to the wrong man whilst Joseph, one of her young friends or ''something'' more, is caught between stopping the wedding or running away from it all'. - Get it. - No. - It's perfect for a friend's wedding. - No, you're right, you're right. No. Although being a book for girls, it's not bad. It's short. It's not for girls, you moron. And you love this stuff, too. Or not any more? Any time. Everyone knows life's not the same after reading Jane Austen. Life certainly isn't the same after reading Jane Austen. And all of this is the travel section? Yep, that's one of the shop's specialities. I've been really into travel guides lately. Really? Really, and it's silly. You're going to laugh, but... When I read a travel guide, I imagine the happy moments to come. And it's like dreaming whilst awake. They've got that... sort of magic that shows you where you'll go, whom you might meet... Isn't it a bit like what Lorca said? That... Memories of a journey are like making that same journey again, but with greater melancholy. Seriously. Because ultimately... I don't know, whenever we're thinking of past travels we're constantly wrapping ourselves in a soft, sad kind of light, and we're always sighing about everything. How'd it go? 'Trying to go back and relive the same experience in a word'. But really, I don't know, if it were possible to travel to the past and relive the same experience, it would never match up to the memory. Right? Isn't that a bit sad? Well, but it's true. Hey, look. I used to have this. You remember? A month around Europe on Interrail with my rucksack... - And your rucksack. - Well... - Well... - Well what? - No way. - What do you mean? No way! Look, sleeping... Sleeping literally anywhere, in public toilets in parks, on benches in libraries, on a ramp in a car park... Don't make me keep going, my back still hurts. No... Where was....? Where was it that I almost got a tattoo of a cobra? - In Budapest. - In Budapest. In the worst dump in Budapest. Well, well... Good thing I didn't listen to you! My mum would've killed me when I got back. - Your mum would never kill you! - Some gigantic tattoo... Mothers love half-metre tattoos on people's backs. - Of course they do. - And snakes, don't get me started. It's like from another lifetime. But without the like. - Yeah. - It's another lifetime. Yep. As for me, now, I'd think again before doing something crazy like that. And sleeping on a ramp in a car park... never again, for sure. Well maybe that's the problem. We think about things too much. I don't know, I think our backs just hurt a little more. - Yeah... - Don't they? They do. That could be it. Well, who knows? Maybe one day we'll do it again, you and me on some crazy backpacking trip. I'm done with the backpacking. Well, maybe not backpacking. But... You and me, we could go somewhere and write our own travel guide. - That doesn't sound bad. - Nope. Like a team. - Right. - Like Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore. All right. Sure, I'll write the text and you make the illustrations. Okay, but instead of New York... We'd go to Tanzania. Why Tanzania? Well, because... Come on April, what are we missing in Tanzania? I don't know, the savannah, a place that's completely different, nature, the wilds we could find there... - I don't know... - Going somewhere else. I'm sorry, but any place where Romans never set foot, I don't feel comfortable. You could say I stick to the classics... Dani, you're not much of an adventurer. - Shall we? - Sure. Thanks. Here. Thanks. - Mind if my mouth is on it? - Put your mouth where you'd like. Prick. Here. I don't care what they say, I love the south. Now this is what you call quality of living. It is. I can't figure out what you're doing in London. It's an amazing city, you can't deny that. But, my God, how I've missed the sun... Hey, how is your sister? She's all right. Finally got her law degree. The only one to follow your parents' footsteps. What she really wants is to be a judge. But the exams are brutal, and very few places open up. She's been trying for two years and nothing. Now she's trying to decide whether or not she wants to work as a lawyer. I can't believe your sister's already finished university, time's really gone by. Tell me about it. Now she's driving us mad with her quarter-life crisis. And you? Going mad with a crisis at 30? Me? Not in the least. I don't mind getting older. Now I can do things I couldn't do before. Yeah. That's true. But there must be things you thought you'd be doing by this age which you're not. Like childhood dreams that suddenly you realise might never come true. But how can you say that, with a job like yours? I mean, coming from me, I dress up as a pirate three times a week, still. But April, your job's amazing. It's not as glamorous as it might seem. We work like animals. I barely have time for anything else. I only know people from the studio. And on top of that, I'm two thousand kilometres from home. You work with Norman Foster. Quit whining. Look, in the end, the work's very mechanical. You do something, and that's it. I'd like... to be part of the overall process. Design my own things and not just be a cog in the wheel, you know? Okay. So why not look for something, somewhere else? April, with your CV you could find a job anywhere. I dunno, ask you father, maybe he could help. Yes, mum. I'll tell dad, sure. Are you still writing? Nah, barely. Maybe a silly song for the kids. - Nothing else. - Sing me something! Dani! - No way. - Why not? We're not at that stage yet. Don't be a downer, I always thought you were great. I always thought you had a lot of talent for this. You must've been the only one. April, really, I'm not that good, that's the truth. To tell stories for the kids it's fine, but that's it. I don't need any more than that. That's sad to hear. It's like giving up on what you've always wanted. No... No, it's not giving up, it's just... Now I think of these things less. And I dunno... since here there aren't many opportunities for anything related to writing, I'd rather spend my time on other things. Other things? Like what? Like other things. No, no. Tell me, I want to know. I want to know what could be more important than writing. Well... I've got other hobbies. Recently I've got into rowing, for example. And I've come here to the river to practice. - Rowing? - Yep. Really? Like in the boats that just went by? No, that's canoeing. In rowing you sit backwards. Like in the Oxford-Cambridge. Have you ever seen it? What? The regattas. You have no idea what I'm talking about! Nope. Nope. Pretty bad for a Londoner... Well it's hard for me to picture you rowing with those feeble arms. These arms are still in training I told you, I've started recently. For how long is recently? Not long. Two weeks. Is she asking them for the guitar...? I can't believe it... Hi. Could I borrow the guitar for a moment? Yeah? Thanks. - Here. - I'm not playing anything. Yes, yes. You're going to play me something. C'mon they're not going to let us have it all afternoon. I want to look into your soul and watch you make an ass of yourself. - Right here? - Yep, right here. Something about me? Something depressing and honest that tells me about you right now, yes. - You're going to want to cut your wrists. - I really want to cut my wrists. It's time for me to reveal myself. That's nothing to worry about. I'll leave my underwear on so no one will get offended. I'm not into Formula 1. I can barely play mus or poker. I get bored at stag parties. In football I'm even bad at goalie. And so here I am. Singing about my flaws to you. I'm so happy to be this way. I want to be Superman but I'm just a normal bloke. A flawed fellow, and it's phenomenal. Sometime I think it's a flaw to be a salad addict. I don't feel a wee bit manly except I'm still aroused by women. I like sentimental films. If I had to, I'd pick Woody Allen. I don't know much about mortgages or stocks. I can't bear talking about how things are going. And so here I am. Singing about my flaws to you. I'm so happy to be this way. I want to be Superman but I'm just a normal bloke. A flawed fellow, and it's phenomenal. I'm chronically late. And a little lazy. I like walking backwards. And anything I could do today I'll do it tomorrow. I eat sweets when at the pictures. I bring books back late to the library. I'm scared of motorbikes. That's fine, I prefer bicycles. And that's my brief summary of all my biggest flaws. There's one last thing to say But my attitude's out for repairs. And so here I am. Singing about my flaws to you. I'm so happy to be this way. I want to be Superman but I'm just a normal bloke. A flawed fellow, and it's phenomenal. Wow, Dani. You're pathetic. - Yeah, I know. - You really are. Thanks for noticing. Thanks. I'd kill you. And I'd kill you. Slowly. No, me even slower. No, me even slower. Do you believe in destiny? Woah. Of course I don't. And in coincidences? - Is that a trick question? - No, no. No. I'm thinking... About how things could've been if I'd acted differently. Like what? All these little decisions we take in life that change everything for good and we don't even realise. What would've become of me if I'd gone to London just a month later? Or two. Would I be in the same city, or in the same studio? I probably would've ended up in another country. Or I might've come back. Or I'd probably be pregnant with twins, like María, who knows. Life's unpredictable, isn't it? Isn't that what's good about it? Have you ever thought about what might've happened if you'd come with me to London? If both of us had ended up there? Tell me you've never thought about it. I've never thought about it. I don't believe that. I bought a ticket to go see you. You? Alone? I swear. And when was that? A long time ago. Maybe two or three months after I was sacked at the paper. Seriously. And why didn't you tell me anything, moron? I dunno, that was the good part. I was going to be a surprise, go there, find you... and when we were face-to-face I'd say: ''Hi, April, what's up?'' You're telling me, you being such a scaredy-cat you'd have got on a plane to come to my house and just say that, ''Hi, April, what's up?'' That's it. Sorry, my English is only so good. ''Hi, what's up?'' is all I know. Well, I would've loved it. I would've loved it if you'd got on a plane, come to London... rang at my door... And only said that: ''Hi, April, what's up?'' Yeah. Me too. Care to explain why you didn't? I guess it was something I saw on your Facebook profile. Something you saw on my Facebook? - Yeah... - All right, surprise me. Well... I looked at your profile to find your address and see what bus I'd have to take from the airport to your house. And I saw there was... This Mark fellow... who was practically living in your flat. But that was meaningless. Well... not so meaningless that you didn't put that you were in a relationship. But we did that as a joke, Dani. We both did that as a joke, but there was nothing serious going on. It looked pretty serious. With Mark? You kidding? Seriously? Are you tell me that you bought a plane ticket and you didn't come to London because you saw pictures with another guy? I don't know. What did you want me to do? I dunno, I saw you were having a great time and I thought, ''What for?'' If it was just to make an ass of myself, better off at home. Dani, he didn't mean anything You should have come. Well, I don't know. It got into my head and that's it. You bought the ticket and everything. You know... With Ryanair. It's a bit weird going to see a picture that started an hour ago. Oh, come on. I just want to take a look. Do you have any idea how hard it is to see Spanish films in London? Really? Don't you have Netflix? I love it here. It still smells the same. Yeah, that hasn't changed. Part bleach, part butter. This is where we went out for the first time. Remember that you cried? Everyone cried a little bit when they saw ''Wall-E''. Well, a little, just a little. Sure you don't want any? It's delicious, try it. No way, stop. I know how they kill the cow. Well... But I will take a potato from you. One might think they don't feed you in London. Why? No reason. What's that? I've got something for you. But you've got to close your eyes. What for? You don't trust me? Of course I don't. Ok, then. I won't give it to you. But what is it? If you don't trust me, I can't give it to you. If you're going to splash water on me or one of those games of yours, I swear I'll kill you right here. Relax, you'll like it. - I hope so. - I hope so, too. Close your eyes. Give me your hand. No! It's not going to be a ring.... Close your eyes! But is it a ring or not? Why would it be a ring? How should I know? You think I was getting down on one knee? I don't know! Close your eyes and stop talking. Give me your hand. This is silly, but it only takes a second. How long is this going to take? Give me a hint. No hints. It's cold. It's just for a second. So, about going back to London tomorrow, is that definite or...? Or could you stay for another few days? Theoretically, it's definite. Why? I was thinking that with everything with your grandmother and all, that maybe it'd be good for you, if you took a break for a bit. Could you ask for a few days off from work? And who knows, we could try making that guide together. Take off for the weekend to Portugal, to Lisbon, Porto... That could be nice, right? I'd love to, Dani. You can't open them. But I can't. Not even a few days? Your grandmother just passed away. Your boss would be fine with it... I'm slammed with work in London, I can't. Also, you sure your workmate wouldn't mind you and me going off for a weekend together? What workmate? Your workmate. The one at the bookshop who wouldn't stop staring at me. She's very pretty. Yeah, she's pretty. And if you want to know her name, I can tell you it's Celia and she makes salads that are out of this world. But that's all I'm going to tell you about pretty Celia. So it's pretty Celia who's got you into this whole vegan thing of yours. What's she going to think when she finds out you're out there gorging on meat with your ex? Number one, I haven't eaten any meat. Number two: officially, you've gone home. And I'm out with a mate watching the match. You've lied to your girlfriend. Dani, I can't believe you. She's not my girlfriend. Also, what do you care? We said we'd never ask each other those things. Yeah... but you've looked at my Facebook and so you have the upper hand, so I have to ask. Sorry, but I haven't looked at your Facebook in ages. Sure, right. Okay. There, I think it's done. You can open them now. I told you it was silly. And if you don't like it, it comes off with soap and water. The little ones just love it. You don't like it... I do. But... I've just never had a tattoo and I wasn't expecting one. This is way better than the one in Budapest. Sure... There's no comparison. Thank you. It's great having you as a friend. But we're not friends. No? And what are we then? I don't know, something else. But I can tell you we're not friends. Not even after being together five years, we're not friends? That's precisely why not. April, I know every inch of your body. Every freckle, every stretch mark... If we were really friends I wouldn't have given you this tattoo. That's a basic rule. So what do real friends do? Other things. If we were real friends, I'd have asked you real friend questions. For example, that ginger boyfriend of yours, what's his name? Instead of avoiding the topic all day. And how do you know I have a ginger boyfriend? If you never look at my Facebook anymore. I was lying. And real friends don't lie. It's not easy, is it? He's the one who called earlier, right? His name is Paul. He's from Dublin. He's one of the project managers. One of my bosses. He's a really good fellow. The plot thickens. And since when are we shagging with the boss, you rascal? Since about... Six... Seven... I don't know why I'm telling you this. That's fine. We're friends. Now are we friends? Please, April. We were together for five years. How are we not going to be friends? Why didn't he come? He had loads of work. He couldn't, he didn't have time. Right... How much? I can barely speak. I can barely breathe. I don't want to wake up. Thanks. Seeing you laugh again. Having you close to me. Everything comes back. Our story goes on without end. Maybe... Holding hands won't be enough. What have I been without you? What have you been without me? What are we doing here today? What we were yesterday. What we could've been. I don't want to lose you. Our story goes on without end. Maybe... Whispering into each other's ears won't be enough. You and me. Here at last. Gazing at one other both of us. Both of us. You and me. Just like yesterday. Becoming you and me again you and me. You and me. Nekane. How's Nekane? - I think it sounds nice. - I like it. What name do you like? I don't know which name, but one that's short or... - Or Lola. - Well, there's two of them. - Lola'd be nice. - Hi. - Hey! - How's everything? Life will go on. Even if you are not. Why looking back? The night's almost through. And I want to kiss you. Just one more time. Our story goes on without end. Maybe... Setting our paths won't be enough. You and me. Here at last. Gazing at one other both of us. Both of us. You and me. Just like yesterday. Becoming you and me again. You and me. The night's almost through. And I want to kiss you. Just one more time. So she like only she would, starts jumping from balcony to balcony, like she's Spiderman or something 'cause she was that drunk. And she's screaming, ''Where's my rum? Where's my rum?'' Don't tell those stories! But you're hilarious, girl. Until, who knows how, she came in through the maths teacher's balcony completely pissed. Can we talk about something else now? Oh hell no. What happened next? She suddenly turned extremely sober and said, ''I beg your pardon, don Pedro, I believe I'm in the wrong room''. And went out the door without the teacher saying a word. Then she spent the rest of the end-of-year trip in Italy not wanting to get off the bus. And two years went by before she tried rum again. No way! Yep, a real spectacle. That's what our friend here was like. How long are we going to keep telling this story? Until it stops being funny. I love that story, I do. Here's to our friend, Drunk April! To Drunk April! And to don Pedro! Go to hell all of you. Don't we have any more stories like that? Well now... - Let's play. We'll obliterate you. - Let's go. - I've got to see this. - Let's go, okay. Ready? - I do. - Okay, let's go. - Michael Douglas - And Bárbara Lennie. Christ, that's super hard. - It's not that hard. - No... Michael Douglas and who? Bárbara Lennie. Who's that? She's gorgeous, hon. You'd love her. Come on, it's not that bad. Oh no, it's impossible. You've just got to think about it. Oh! Yes! I've got it. Already? - Yes. - Sure? Yes. In five degrees. That's the mother of my children! We can in three. Really? Show it. Okay. First: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are married and they're both in ''Traffic''. - In ''Traffic''. - One degree. Okay? Second: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Antonio Banderas in ''The Mask of Zorro''. Awesome. Two degrees. And the third: He doesn't know. Antonio Banderas and Bárbara Lennie in ''The Skin I Live In''. - You go, boy! - Three degrees. Bárbara Lennie's not in ''The Skin I Live In''. Yes she is. She's in it. Very little, but she's in it. I don't know about that. Actually, she's the best part. She's the only reason to watch it. Well, that's not too bad. The tiger part was super believable. I loved the tiger in ''Life of Pi''. Really. What? She was in ''The Skin I Live In''! - Yeah! - Go team! Go team! She is pretty. Isn't she seeing Mario Casas? No, José, no. Drop it. - It's not her? - It's not. - Who wants another? - Me. - Me. - Me too. - Get me one. - No way I'm getting you a beer. Please, I just want to smell it, please. - I really need to. - No way, you'll drink it. You know me so well... Honey, one. One. I've been good the whole pregnancy. And so, what's going on with Dani? I see you're getting on well. Yeah... I don't know... It seems unreal, you know? I'm going to tell you something and don't take it the wrong way, okay? I'm telling you as a friend and because I care about you. Okay. Be careful. Careful with what? Don't play with him. When you left, he was a wreck. But I'm not even doing anything. I'm with Paul. Why didn't Paul come? Having a rough spot or something? No, no. I just wanted to come alone and be here at home, that's all. Yeah. In fact, I practically life with him. Oh, that's great! Good for you! It's an important step. Yeah, a big one. I'm thinking it over. Come on... He's in love with you. You're in love with him. Plus, your shared flat is a shithole and his house in Chelsea is a palace, and practically next to the studio. What's the problem? We've only been going out six months. It's all gone so fast. And I've never moved in with anyone. It feels strange taking that step, and even more so in London. Moving in with your boyfriend isn't all that strange. You can try, and if it doesn't work out, then it doesn't. Yeah, but it all seems very sudden. Like I wasn't expecting it to happen so fast, you know? Like your wedding. Or María having kids. It's like we're suddenly older, and it's taken me by surprise. Well... We haven't changed all of a sudden. We've changed like it normally happens. The way everyone does. The thing is, since you haven't been here, you've missed everything. Yeah. Well, from now on I don't want to miss out on anything. So come back. Or are you going to stay there forever? Well... Look! Look, look, look! - They're moving! - Yeah. Fast, too. They're nervous. Yup. It's late to be out. They're partying. Those dark eyes... Those dark eyes I don't want to see them cry. I just want to listen. Tell me what I want to hear. Tell me you're going to laugh. Tell me. Tell me now the city's asleep. For some time now. For some time now your voice has sounded like a pen on paper describing how you fly in dreams. Let it be your dark eyes shining on me as I walk. Rain falls on the grey floor. Time goes by and I can't laugh. The night is long, and my voice bitter. Today I saw the sun awake. And your pupils shining. But wait, don't worry and you'll see. The good times will be back. But wait, don't worry and you'll see. The rain will bring them back. Those dark eyes. Those dark eyes I don't want to see them cry. I just want to listen. Tell me what I want to hear. Tell me you're going to laugh. Tell me. Tell me now the city's asleep. Tell me now the city's asleep. Tell me now... The city's asleep. So see you tomorrow? - You don't have to go, really. - Don't be silly, - we're going to be with you. - If you feel sad or anything tonight, just give us a call, okay? Okay. - Love you tons. - Me you. Love you. - See you tomorrow. - Ciao. - See you tomorrow. - Ciao. I think I shouldn't have left. This is where I've got my family, my friends, everything I care about. And now everything's changed so much I barely recognise it. Well... But you left chasing your dreams... And look at you now. You've made it. But I never imagined it like this. How'd you imagine it? In a smaller studio... With other, more creative projects, with other people. With you. My dreams always included you. I wish you had come with me to London. Maybe you should've waited. Instead of running off right when they'd hired me at the paper. I didn't run off, Dani I was here for months and finding nothing. That's barely any time, April. What did you expect? To join Cruz y Ortiz as soon as you got your degree? No... I didn't. But it was extremely frustrating. Six years studying like that for nothing. What was I supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for something to appear? I had no future here. Your father could've helped. Dani, my father won't help for shit. He's never helped, he couldn't be bothered. - That's not true. - Yes it is. But you don't want to see that. Not you, nor my mother. Don't you remember everything he was going to arrange for me when I finished studying? All the projects for his little girl, so I wouldn't have to leave Spain? Also, I don't want to get a job because of connections. I want to accomplish things on my own And of course you don't remember, Dani. Because right then you were super busy with your new friends at the paper, coming and going, back and forth. You didn't notice anything else You didn't notice I was at home, alone, trapped wasting away. Maybe, if you'd been a little happy for me, for a change, I might've acted differently. But no. You always had to be the centre of it all. You couldn't stand being in someone else's shadow, not even a little. You needed to have a cooler job than mine, April. And that's why you were gone from one day to the next. As if those five years hadn't meant anything at all to you. Dani, of course they did. Don't you understand? They meant everything to me. I would've taken anything. Anything to stay here with my family, with you, to be together. I went to London because I felt alone. Because I felt terribly alone. You were a prick and you know it, Dani. And you were selfish. You know what hurt the fucking most? It wasn't that you were being an idiot, like you're doing right now. It was that when you were sacked you didn't come to see me in London. That just killed me. But you made it quite clear that you'd completely forgotten about me. I bought a ticket. And you didn't come. And you have no idea how bad a time I was having alone in London, how hard it was and how much I missed you the whole time. You have no idea how much I just wanted to hug you the whole time, Dani. If you missed me so much, why you never called any of the times you came to visit over these five years? 'Cause as far as I know, this isn't the first time you've come. Like at Christmas. When you came to see your mother and grandmother and all your friends. And you filled the internet with your photos. - Why didn't you call at Christmas? - Don't turn it around. I'm not turning anything around. I just want to know why you didn't call at Christmas. Because it wasn't the right time. And why do you always get to decide when's the right timeand when isn't. Maybe right then I felt like my life was in shambles. And I would've loved to see you. And take walks with you. Get a drink, go to the pictures... Who knows, even see a film from beginning to end. But I bet that never occurred to you. You've called everyone except me, April. But of course, right then you weren't thinking of coming back to your old life but now you are. - You have no idea. - No? Well that's what it seems like. Look April, you've spent the whole day saying ''Oh, I miss this so much. My friends, and the sun. It was silly of my to leave, why'd I do that?'' You're so affectionate and so cheerful... You look at me and you laugh. And I look at you, and my world turns upside-down. Everything I had tucked away deep inside that I thought was gone forever... I don't understand any of this. I don't understand... Why didn't you call at Christmas? Can you be honest for once in your life and give me an answer? What's changed, April? What's changed this time? - I don't understand. - Because I came with Paul. Dani, I came with Paul. Because I was here with Paul, I brought him to meet my family. What did you want me to do? That the three of us would get together for coffee? Idiot. Thanks. That's everything I've got. And why didn't you throw it away if it's all rubbish? Because it's your rubbish. Your books, your CDs, your photos. Before they were out here. Like waiting for you to come back. I put them away when it became too much to keep hearing you in every song. Or to see you in every photo. Without knowing when I'd see you or hear you again, like I am now. What we had, you and me, it was lost. As as much as it hurt, I wasn't ever getting it back. So when I couldn't take it anymore, I put everything in the box and tried to forget it. But I would never have thrown them away, because... They reminded me of whom I'd once been, and whom I'd like to continue being. How could I get rid of the best thing that had ever happened to me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I had to let all that out. That's my favourite. Little April. There... It's okay... It's okay... I don't know why I'm in London, I don't know what I'm doing there... Feeling so alone... And with everything I care about here, all the people I love. How could I have fucked it all up so badly? It's okay. I just want this one more time. Please. One more time. Dani, I can't. I can't. Are you all right? No. Can you hold me? Of course. Come here. Don't cry. I have an idea. Tomorrow after the burial, we both will go to London. We'll tell Celia, so she can come with us. Then we'll introduce her to Paul. They'll meet, fall in love, and go live in that shitty flat of yours. Celia wouldn't last half an hour in my flat. So fuck 'em. To hell with Paul and Celia. Forget London. We'll go to Portugal. Get our rucksacks and go to Portugal, like we said. And make our travel guide. Would you prefer that? But you said you didn't want to do any more backpacking. I lied. Dani... Yeah? Tell me a tale. Okay. Which one? I don't care which. No one's told me a story in a long time. How about Babar? All right. The one about Babar. In the jungle, a little elephant named Babar was born... Babar's mother loved him very much... Is that the voice you use at the library? - Don't interrupt during tale time. - Sorry. And as she loved him so much, to help him fall asleep, she would rock him with her trunk and sing to him sweetly... As time passed, Babar started growing and growing, and played with the other baby elephants. Babar loved making little hills of sand. One day, whilst riding on his mother's back, an evil hunter surprised them between the bushes, and BAM! - He shot his gun. - No... Yes. Poor Babar. Poor Babar. The frightened monkeys hid, the birds flew away and the hunter ran after Babar. But Babar was very fast. He was scared of being caught by the hunter, so he ran very, very fast. And Babar escaped. And he came to an enormous city, full... Full of surprises for Babar. Does he get away? Yes, Babar got away. But he's surprised by all the cars, buildings... so many new things he'd never seen before. It's so nice to let go. So feel, to yearn. Dream about seeing each other. Touching each other. We bite and adore each other. How we love to laugh. And keep saying the words. Never letting us sleep. And keep living this thing. Loving each other. Hope we never ever lose our love. So close together. Nothing will ever happen to us. Tell me, tell me one more time. I just want to say I love you. I just want to say I love you. April... Someone's here to see you. Would you like a bite to eat? I honestly am in no mood to cook. I would imagine. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. I'll just cut up some tomatoes or what not. Don't know if there's much in there. I'll fix up some tapas, don't worry. - Marcos is getting big so fast. - Isn't he? He's turning out very handsome... - And he's really a dear... - I hadn't seen him in a long time. Yes. I'll get out a bit of ham. This one there likes ham, doesn't he? Oh, he certainly does. Don't you remember at Christmas? That's right. He right stuffed himself. Of course he likes it. You know what? I'm glad April's found someone in London. So am I. - They make a lovely couple. - They do. I've got a good feeling about them. Speaking of London, why don't we both go for a visit? - You'd come with me? - Why not? - We could surprise her. - All right. But don't tell her. I'll take care of everything. You do all that, the tickets and such... The internet's beyond me. Don't worry, I'll take care of the tickets and everything... All of it, don't you worry. I'll have to learn to live alone now. Well... We've got each other. Don't worry. I earned my degree in Architecture here in Seville, and afterwards I submitted proposals to several competitions and I won a EUROPAN. I've also published several articles, including one in Arquitectura Viva. Later I moved to London, and... Through an ARQUIA grant I landed an internship at Alejandro Zaera-Polo's studio, and I spent some time there. And after that, I sent my CV to Foster and Partners, they called me for an interview, and it's been great ever since. It really does look good. Why do you want to leave London? I would like to be back home. I see... Have you done much in renovations? At our construction firm we mostly do home renovations. Yes, I've participated in the refurbishing of a palace in Rome and the redevelopment of the Battersea Power Station in London. Yes, I see that. Well I'm not going to lie, your CV is very impressive. Thank you. We've love for you to work with us. But I'm afraid we can't offer you much at the moment. What would you say to starting with a trial period for a couple months? And then we can see if you fit. A trial period? Yes, well, you could call it an adaptation period. Are you registered as self-employed? I ask because we can't pay your social security. You'd have to take care of that yourself. Hi there! Cheers. The bag's for you, the bag's for you. He's not picking up another bag in his life, not even a bike. Good morning, do you have a moment? Morning... - Have you got everything? - Yep. Take care of yourself. I will. Love you, mum. Love you. I'll call you when I get there. Okay. - Hello. - Hello. - Are you Dani? - Yep. Okay, great I'm ready to go, we'll leave as soon as you are. We've got a long ride to Lisbon. Can you hold on just a second? My friend isn't here yet. Okay, can we wait for her in the car? I'm not in a proper spot. Yeah, go ahead. That's quite a rucksack. I never know what to pack. I always end up packing two hundred things. Yeah... So, ever been to Lisbon? Nope. - No? - Not to Lisbon. Well, it's a brilliant city. Can you give me a second? Sure. - I'll be waiting in the car. - Okay. It didn't take long to notice that all around nothing shared the shadow. And soon came the jealous envy of that sunset. There was no one else like him. Escaped from a place where Sunday is just another day. Just a speck of dust. Now who could grab those hands? Who dares go back again? Who saw that giant leap? Who would want to get that far? And about that summer the name was forgotten. The haste was all lost. Walking right past. Feet that no longer hold... ONLY WHO LOVES FLIES, GO AND FLY The memory of steps taken. Now who could grab those hands? Who dares go back again? Who saw that giant leap? Who would want to get that far? Now who could grab my hands? Who saw me take that giant leap? Who saw me fall back to floor? Getting up and taking flight. Who saw me take that giant leap? Who dares be born again? The summer has arrived. Sweltering streets and neighbourhoods. From here I can see the flames above the Giralda. The horses are dead tired. Glancing over at the river. And in Alfalfa Square not a sound to be heard. Yesterday I was drinking. I was swallowed by the late night. Now my whole body's aching and I feel nothing in my soul. I'll just lie here very still sweating in this bed scaring off the memories and listening to strange music. And when the dusk falls I'll go down to La Alameda. Take a seat on a terrace and wait for you to appear. And we'll talk about some nonsense. And we'll drink a couple beers. Make plans like we always a trip down to the beach. Winter has arrived. The orange trees are all weeping. The flowers are their tears that one day we walked upon. The frozen gipsies are burning their rosemary. The smoke wafted away just like all of their predictions. Yesterday I was drinking from night-time 'til the morning. And all that I remember is the sound of my footsteps. I'll just lie here very still shivering in this bed scaring off the memories and greeting all the ghosts. And when the dusk falls I'll go down to La Alameda. Take a seat on a terrace and wait for you to appear. And we'll talk about nonsense. And we'll drink a couple beers. Make plans like always a trip down to the beach. But you don't appear anymore no matter how much I hope you do. Almost five years ago you moved away to England. They say that there are the beaches haven't even got sand. But one day I'll go to see you when all this sorrow dies away. To my parents and my brothers To my friends forever To those who have ever emigrated To nostalgic and melancholic For you, Laura
