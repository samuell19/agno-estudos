Jose Santos Rodriguez approaches the last 100 meters and he's the leader. He's following in his father's steps, who was also a great athlete, Abimael. And he crosses the finish line! Well done! - I love you, Yolanda. - I love you too. I promised I would win. Yes. Jose, Jose, Jose...! And you will be the next champion, boy. Hey, girl. - Boy. - Girl. Boy. Jose? Jose... Jose!

"ANGEL OF MY LIFE" in this huge event. And the champion is leading. - He's gonna win. - Yes, yes, yes. Mr. Abimael, can you do me a favor? Can you take Angel over there? You know that Jose Santos doesn't want him to come to the competition. Yes, sure, but the boy also wants to see his dad. I know. I know, Mr. Abimael. But please help me. Help me out, will you? - No! - Yes. - No! - Oh, yes! - No! - Let's go, kid. - Yes. - No. - Let's go, kid. - For a while, okay? One... two... To the finishing line. Where he's expected by all the experts. Come closer, people. His relatives are expecting him too. José Santos keeps on leading the race. He's approaching the last lap. There he is... Champion! Honey, honey, breathe. Jose Sa... Jose Sa... - Jose Santos. - Again? Breathe, breathe, breathe. - Let's see. Jose Santos. - Jose. I'm here. I'm here. Leave me here. Honey! Please. Tell him, "Daddy, wake up. This isn't fun." Daddy, wake up. This isn't fun." Abimael, can you take the kid home? Jose Santos is going to wake up. I don't want Angel to see him like that. All right, all right. Let's go, kid. Let's go. We'll be right back. Victoria. Still. Don't move. Let's see. Leave us alone. Yolanda, leave us alone. Go. It's okay. You know what happened? What happened? We had to do an emergency surgery. You have a pacemaker now. You know what that means, right? You can't run again, Jose Santos, never again. Say goodbye to sports. You can't run again. Unless you want to die. Understood? Jose Santos... Look, kid. Look. Look, the baby is there. Look, kid. He looks like me, Yolanda. Look, look. - Okay. - Your little brother. Easy, boy, easy. You'll be the next champion in the family. You, boy. Just you, yes. Easy. Go with mom. Go with mom. Oh, with mom. You know what the champion wins? Dad's heart. Dad's heart. Look, kid, look. Look. 18.30. 18.30. Almost... almost 16.6 kilometers per hour. - Dad's heart. - Dad's heart. Dad's heart. Dad's heart! Oh, grandpa! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome... - Grandpa. - How are you, kid? Is dad here yet? Not yet. An event that brings together many children... Hey, hey. Hey, hey, come here. Hey... Hey. Come here, young man. We're ready so you can win all the medals, like your dad and I. Are you crazy? Dad won all the medals in college and school. Right. And you can win them too, right? Besides, dad won the Santa Marta Sea Race many times. What about you? Can't you do it or what? Can't you win them too? I'm going to demonstrate it once I can run the Santa Marta 500 anniversary race. In 20 minutes. Like my dad. Come here, kid. I love you so much! Sorry, Mrs. Beatriz. You know I enjoy everything you guys do. Of course. But I need you to help me with my husband. He's a bit shy for those things. Yes, Mrs. Beatriz. No. Hello, honey, talk, talk. You talk. You talk. Mrs. Beatriz? - How are you? - Oh, she hung up. What's up? How are you, honey? - Compadre, come here. - My bro. Hello? Yes, Mrs. Beatriz, let me put Jose Santos on the phone. Thank you. - Honey... talk. - Angelica. Say anything. Anything, please. Hello. Yes? Yes, Jose Santos. Yes, the champion. What? The Love Festival is today? Right. Fine. Yes, thank you. You're very kind. All right, bye. Okay, so? Darling, who's going to attend that lame Love Festival? We are. The whole family will go to support Angel. You're in charge of him so you'll go. - Bye. - Okay... - Jose Santos. - Hey, compadre. Jose. Jenny, you're in charge. I'll be right back. All right? Jose. Honey, 15 years have passed and you still think that I'm in charge of him? Jose Santos, can you please stop doing math and listen to me? I'm not covering my ears, Yolanda. I agreed to go live to that town because you, Jose Santos, the great champion, couldn't admit in front of his friends that you had a son like Angel. Baby, if you're tired of me and my nagging, it's very easy. Just ask me to and I'll go back to Santa Marta with my kids. Okay, Yolanda, whatever you want. But if you're leaving, take Angel with you. I'll stay with Alvaro and Thael. Yolanda, Yolanda. Why going to the Love Festival? Dad is with Angel. Because I want you to go. I want the children to go. I want us to go as a family to support Angel. No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No... Yes, we are going. - Grandpa. - Hello, kid. Is dad here? I don't see him. He won't come. Oh? But your mom is coming. Kid, hey. You should go with your friends. They're hanging with a blonde girl. She might even become your girlfriend, kid. No, grandpa, I don't want to have a girlfriend. I just want to run. Besides, I only get to know ugly girls. I've been introduced to four ugly girls. Don't like. That's right. That's right. Arms. Arms. That's it. That's it. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Cleopatra. Hi. I'm... - Angel Rodriguez... - Oh! Is requested... Hey, what's wrong with him? He's like that. To carry the Olympic flame and light the cauldron as part of the protocol to begin the Love Festival. Here he comes. This renowned kid is walking as a winner. He's an angel with wings today. Welcome everyone to the Love Festival. Also, a special welcome to Jose Santos Rodriguez, the champion. He came with his family, who has always supported spiritually and affectionately this great athlete who we are so proud of. Honey, it's the last time I come with you to this stupid type of events. Darling, you're here. Just enjoy yourself. I didn't come to enjoy anything. I just came because I don't want to see you crying all day and all night long. Dad, let's go home. Dad, I'm bored. Alvarito, look who's there. That won't make you feel bored anymore, right? This is one of the most important competitions of the Love Festival. The relay race. Angel Rodriguez's winning is almost a fact because he has always stood out. He has set many important records... There he goes. There he goes. He's leading the relay. Angel Rodriguez is coming closer to the finish line. And he fell down. He fell down. Unbelievable, when he was about 5 meters away from the finish line and become the champion, he fell down. Angel Rodriguez has had an ugly fall. Alvaro! Alvaro, take Thael with you. Angel! Excuse me, excuse me. Angel! Sorry, sorry. - Angel, kid. - Angel! - Angel. - Baby. - Come here, baby. - Angel, kid. You were great. You are my champion, baby. You did great. Dad? Dad is getting some water. He'll come soon. - Okay? - Good. You are a champion, baby. - Good. - Yes, good, look. - Eh! - Rafa, Andres. - Very good. - Ponky. - Hug. - Very good. Bravo! Good. Good, good! Good. Good. Guys, he's the one I talked to you about. He was given to me the day after I married Yolanda. And you fell down on your honeymoon too? Hey, why don't you trust such a stud? I behaved like a gentleman on my honeymoon. And the very same night, Yolanda got pregnant. Any other question? ♪ Champion! Angel is the champion! ♪ - ♪ Champion! ♪ - Yes. Let's go to eat, dad. I'm hungry. No, son. You must be tired. No, dad.

It's not necessary, Jose Santos. It's not about the things we don't have at home. It's about one thing I don't have. The man I married. You think you lost that man? Yes. I lost him the day Angel was born. I lost him the day he didn't have the courage to face the situation. I lost you when Angel was born. - No. - When everything disappeared... Don't talk. Don't say anything. You're the one who always talks. It's my turn now. You know when you lost me, Jose Santos? The day I stopped being someone so you could live your life. Can you let me talk? I also have things to say. No. You know when you lost me? When, together with all of you, I turned my back on my child. Okay, so if you're thinking about breaking up, what we have to do is... I'm not thinking about it. It's a fact. So what we have to do is... What I have to do is to leave with my three kids. Can I say something, Yolanda? Let's say anything, Jose Santos. We'll take our kids to school, we'll go to work in the restaurant as usual, and on weekend I'll leave with my three kids. Guys, get in the car. - No, we're waiting... - No, dad is coming. - Get in. - Come, Thael. Quick. Yolanda. Yolanda, I know that Angel is grounded. But I'll take him by train. No, dad. Jose, can you take him to the doctor? You want me to close the restaurant, dad? - No. - Exactly. The restaurant won't be closed. I'm not the one who's dying. How about you, Yolanda? Do you have some time? She doesn't have time either, dad. I do have time, Abimael. But please take him. I still have a couple of things to discuss with Jose Santos. Mom, mom! Hi, baby. Hi, my precious baby. - Good? - Yes. Mom, I'm coming. Stay with Abimael, okay? Be blessed. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

I have to talk to him in private. - Oh. - Go out. You two are dating. You are dating. Grandpa has a girlfriend... Isn't true what he said? That he's going to die? No way. He isn't going to die. Get the tests done. Give the orders to Jose Santos. Tell him to get the tests done. Once I come back from South Africa, I'll read them. So long? I'll be away just for some days. Just get the tests done, okay? Come here. Grandpa... Good, good. Angel, Let's go, kid. Let's go. Yes. Victoria sent you those orders. She said she would talk to you once she returns from South Africa. I'll get him tested so once she comes back, the results are ready. But according to her, he only has one or two months to live.

What prize do you want for having won the baseball champion and also going on vacation? Again, dad. You know I want to go to Ciudad Perdida in an army helicopter. - Really? - Really. And I also want to go to the Santa Marta Aquarium with all my family, and... - What? - And Cleopatra. - With Cleopatra. - Oh, very good! Okay, son. Choose which of those prizes you prefer. Baby, it's easy. We'll go to Ciudad Perdida and then we'll go down to the Aquarium, easy. Okay, but I want to go to Ciudad Perdida just with dad. No, no, son. You're asking for too much. That's impossible. Dad. What are you looking at, dad? Nothing. Dad. Thanks for bringing me. What are you guys looking at? Looking at the sea, son. Oh, yeah? Can I join you? - Of course. - Of course, baby. Okay. Your dad and I were here many years ago. How long ago? - 15? - 15? What happened? What? So this is where you made me. Yes, yes. Hey, guys! This is where they made me! - Angel! - 15 years ago. - No, no! - With the dolphins! "With the dolphins"! Dad, don't fall asleep. April's Fools, son! Dad! Angel! You scared me, dad. - Angel. - Yes? Do you want to sleep with me tonight? - Right. You're just kidding. - Seriously, Angel. In our bed. With mom and me. Really? - Seriously? - Seriously. Wait for me, Angel. Angel, wait. - Sorry. - Hello, baby. Mom, can I sleep with you? - Sure, baby, come here. - And with me too? How are we going to sleep? In mom's bed? Or in dad's couch? I don't know about you, Angel, but I want to sleep in this bed. Get in. All right, all right. Right here. Mom. Dad. You two haven't slept together for a long time because of me. Isn't that right? No, it's not true, baby. You're not to blame for anything. For anything. If I stay here, the three of us can sleep together forever. - Is that what you want? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes, yes, yes. Mom. The movie's over. Yes. I'll bring another movie. - Yeah, go bring another one. - Yes. - I'll go with you. - No, no, mom, no.

For Alvarito. Thanks, brother. Good. Mom, mom. We must take Angel to see Dr. Victoria. She's back from her trip. - Calm down. - Calm down. Hello, cute girls. - Miss. - Yes? Will you look after him for me, please? - Sure. - Of course. Well, what can I do? There's a drawing board. How was your trip to the Sierra? Wonderful. And you went too, Yolanda? No, it was just Angel and Jose Santos. - And you didn't complain? - No, I didn't. Do you remember that time we went with your dad? Right, yes. Abimael was excited. He wanted to stay up there. He said that the relationship of the Arhuacos with Earth was extraordinary. Victoria, please. You don't have to make small talk. Just tell us how much longer Angel will live. What? I appreciate your understanding. But please don't do things any harder. What are you guys talking about? Well, you sent us a message with dad. You said our boy doesn't have time left. Check the tests you sent us. So what? Is Angel going to die or...? - No, Yolanda. - No? Angel is fine. - Are you sure? - Of course he is. Listen, come closer. Look at the test results. Come here. Yes. What I like is running. I don't like painting very much. And you like working. So go to work. It was a pleasure. - Miss. - Yes? Can I use Victoria's bathroom? - Of course. - Oh, good. Angel's tests results are good. Abimael was... He changed the tests. What did you guys do with Angel these days? Well, since we knew our boy was going to die, we gave him all the love that we had never given him. I took him to the Sierra, we went to the aquarium, and he went to Alvarito's school. Well... That's it, that's why. He wanted you to get to know him, to give him all the love you had never given him. Let me get this straight, Victoria. You're telling me that my dad was going to die and he made up this lie? Angel is a being of light. He's a being of love. Dad was crazy. - Angel. - Angel. - Angel, son! What is it? - Angel. Angel, wait, Angel! Angel! What's wrong, son? Angel. - Angel, baby. - Angel, wait! - Angel. - Angel, Angel, son! Bring a stretcher! - Angel, baby. - Angel, son. Don't move him. His situation is critical. Very serious. The impact suffered by Angel paralyzed him. Angel doesn't want to live. He realized that everything was a lie, that all the love he experienced with you these days was just a lie. He went from deep joy to infinite sadness. Angel's current condition is not good for his pathology. He has the same heart disease you have, Jose Santos. The same disease your father had. Men in your family have weak hearts, Yolanda. At least you've fulfilled all his dreams. Not all of them, Victoria. There's something that Angel wanted the most. He wanted to run the Sea Race, like his dad did. "In a small Italian town "surrounded by seas and mountains, "I saw old Gepetto. "One afternoon he was at home, alone as usual. "It was beginning to get cold "and Gepetto decided to light the fireplace "with some wood left. "He took the thicker log, "but instead of lighting it, he looked at it. "Then he looked for his tools. "He carved a head with eyes and legs. "He was carving his mouth "when he felt someone touching his arm. "Gepetto looked around and continued working. "The old carpenter then painted his eyes. "Pinocchio was bothered by the sandpaper. "It tickled him." "'What if I call you Pinocchio?' He said". Yolanda... my son is going to be in that race.
