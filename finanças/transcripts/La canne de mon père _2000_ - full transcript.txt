. THE CANE OF MY FATHER Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven Give us this day... - Dad. - What is it, Marc? I've got to pee. I need to. - Dad. - Go ahead. Hurry. Lazybones. - Amen. - Come say goodnight, and go to bed. - Already done, Dad? Will you tell us about your fight? - No, Marc. Not tonight. - Come on, Dad. Yes. The fight where you were wounded. - In July 1917. - Your mother said "not tonight". About the gun. You know it by heart. And you, Mom? - You promised. - No, not tonight. Come, leave us be. Until tomorrow, sweetheart. Alone at last. Say, what story were you going to tell them tonight? - I don't know if you deserve it. - I'm not the boss here? Now that you mention it... this is what's left till the end of the month. We're spending too much. Oh no. We don't have enough for the basic necessities. The grocer complained about the bill. He wants to see money this week... and I have no more coupons. I'll slaughter a pig and give him a ham. We can't go on like that, Charles. Yes, my dear, we'll go on. We will go on. We can even make another baby, if you want. You know how fond I am of babies. Yeah, right. I'm just a baby machine. The baby machine is getting tired of it. What is it, my Ophélie? Going rogue? You're as beautiful as ever. There's already a little one on the way. And you kept that from me? But, wait... - How long? - Four months. Four months. Holy shit. I'm going to announce the news. - The cane is loud. - Shit's about to hit the fan. Let's sing to cheer him up. All rise. One, two, three. ♪ Count your men, Sergeant Count them well ♪ Some sit on the toilet and you know nothing about it Nothing, nothing, nothing. Greetings, Dad. Go on, hurry up. There is work to do today. - Come on. - Like always. What did you say? Me? Nothing, Dad. Are you afraid of your opinion? I said there is always work to be done. Well done! If you have something to say, say it openly. - All right? - All right, Dad. Hop. Go, girl. The weather forecast for this 29th April 1947. That leg is hurting again today. So we get some rest? Gaëtan, eat your sandwich. The bread is rationed. With Ramadier it's the "Ramadier diet". You look after the pigeons. - The others... - The animals. - This afternoon? - The pepper factory. - Are there no lessons today? - We'll catch up on Sunday. - You look after the chickens. - I'll pick up the eggs. Hurry up, or you'll get caught. I'm sick of it. I want to go to a boarding school. You can't, you know that. We're all gonna end up dumb. Come on, don't talk nonsense. You learn a lot with your father. With dad it's not a real school. I want to go to the real one. I'm sure Grandma would want that too. That's not certain. And dad doesn't agree. Come, run along! God damn! Étienne, come here. Grab a bag. I'll fill the pan and put it in there. I'll spill less... of this shit. In the trench! An attack with enemy grenades! Fire! Ceasefire. The sergeant arrived. All of a sudden you're very quiet. Are you maybe plotting something? And, how many have you done? One, two, three. What do you say? What are you saying? If we talk we inhale pepper and that burns our throat. Even with the masks? Let's fix that. - In 1914, against that nasty gas... - Custard gas. Custard gas? Mustard gas! Repeat 100 times after me, if you get it wrong again. This is as best as we can do. Men, life is one big party. It's going well. Get started. Still four boxes to fill. How many peppercorns do you need... for 4 boxes of ground pepper? One box holds 100 bags. 20 grams per bag makes 2 kilos per box. Another 8 kilos. Here. This is 500 grams of ground pepper. "Men, life is one big party". You're such a child! And a foodie to boot. - Worthless Sophie! - Jean! Fuck! Go wash your hands. It gets better and better. Now even your daughter is rude. You wouldn't have given me a litter of rogues? Isn't that what you wanted? Rascals, anarchists, just like you. No anarchists. Children who can say no. Who can say "stuff it" if necessary, that's all. My Charles. Same scene as yesterday at the bakeries on this 29th April 1947. The shops are closed for the long line-ups. The crisis would have reached its peak. Food shortages are still the main concern... - Get out, you reek of pepper! - Jean, you say "you smell". And you? You reek of shit. Pierre, write down 100 times: "You say, 'You smell bad'." I have already told you to shake yourself down outside. Get out! Bread will be 250 grams per person per week. Mom, talking about smelling bad... Is that André's meat? I'm going to give him a piece of my mind. Hell's bloody bells! Charles. We're going to offend the butcher. - Étienne, my bike. - Yes, Daddy. Strap my foot. Tight. Yes, like that. Wait for me. What a hothead. Wait for me. Damn. We'll never catch up. Good evening. Where's your husband? - At Armand, Mr. Charles. - I thought so. Jean! - Good evening. - Hello. - Jean, hell's bloody bells! - What can I do for you? Did you become a perfumer? - Perfumer? - What does this smell like? That's Charolais. Spoiled meat, fat Jean, no Charolais. Eat your perfumed Charolais yourselves. Still at work, miss? For fun, Mr. Bertoux. Planning a chorus for the holidays. - Good. - Thank you for the wood. - Was it enough? - I could seal the latrines. The awning should also be repaired. I'll send you one of my men. - Your what? - Excuse me, my sons. "Men" is what we say in northern France where we come from. Miss, excuse me, may I continue? Go ahead, Suzanne. It gets even better when the new school is finished up there. We can make a playground. The Mayor was talking about it. Election promises, empty promises. Let's keep each other informed. Good-bye, miss. - Mr. Bertoux? - Yes? - When the new school is there, you'll send me your children? So they can succeed in life. A successful life is important. And not succeed in life. Goodbye. The cane is coming straight at us, boys. Come on, get up. Shall we sing? Nursing is today's job. Thanks to science... the profession of nurse becomes more important. - Move. - Genevieve is a nurse. I care for patients all day. Medicines, bandages, body care in general, washing patients and talking to them. A lot of talking and listening. This helps to relieve the pain. There is the work with the doctor, or with the surgeon during the operations. Hop. Pierre! Étienne! The pigs should get out. Marie! - Yes, Mom? - I'm going. Look after the little ones. Yes, Mom. Pierre, come here. - Sophie, will you do the eggs? - Yes. Me too. You'll supply timber. I can't, my leg hurts too much. Don't take the motorway, you'll avoid the cops. Okay, Dad. Ms. Cécile. Thank you. How much did you say you got? Eight? If we'd done like you, the Chouquet factory would have been bankrupt for a long time. How does the pepper plant run? - It's running. - It doesn't allow... your sons to go to boarding school. Neither my sons nor my daughters. There is a solution, Cécile. Sell your shares in the forest to your brother. For a good price. I came for help, not for haggling. Mama? You've always done what you wanted. Continue. What a muck. Wait. Look here. Give me the keep-sake box. Look. And another one. The wound doesn't close... as long as there's still shrapnel coming out. I don't want to see you suffer. It's all right, sweety. Pass me the syringe. This leg has already been through a lot. Clean a bit there. Right. Did you bring something to prepare a nice meal? Pierre is too young to drive. Usually I go along. He's not insured, it's an unnecessary risk. - It pays so little. - It's more than nothing. I don't want Pierre driving that truck. It won't happen anymore. Promised. Meanwhile he's getting by as an adult. Rather as an outlaw. That's what they all learn with you. It's time they go to a real school, don't you think? Count your men, Sergeant Count them well. Some are on the toilet and you know nothing about it. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Hello, Dad. This afternoon General De Gaulle will hold a press conference. He'll explain the target and formation of the RPF. Leave some for us. Thanks, Mom. Bless us, O Lord. Bless this meal, those that have prepared this and give bread... to those who have not. Amen. Hello, Uncle Benoît. Hello, chicks. - Hi, sister. - Hello. - How are you? - Life is one big party. - Can I speak with your husband? - He's fixing his car. Don't you dare! What'd you come here for this early, brother-in-law? Hello, Charles. So you're still hauling wood? - So what? - Nothing. And? I want to talk about the elections. Elections? Do you want to run? - Yes, because you are not. - I'm not? - I haven't decided yet. - I'm not running against you. You'd better not! One advice: Keep out of the village. You just look after your plant. Why can't we ever talk? Why? You're asking why? That's a good one, Benoît Chouquet. Look hard enough, it's right here. Come on. That darn Benoît. If you work well, we'll go to the movies tonight. A film about the war against the Krauts. - Is there no school today? - Mama will quiz you. I'll do the pigs. There'll be time for learning. - What did my brother want? - He wants to stand for election. Benoît a mayor. Why not a bishop? No, Marie, you're wrong. Wait, we'll start again. Sorry, sweetheart. What is that? - Does that ring a bell? - Where does it say? - Cicero. - That always pissed me off. So what? You can still help me. Actually not. Hello, Miss teacher. Yes, I'm listening. Bloody hell!! Now that's some news. Huh? Oh, no, thank you. No, it's not gonna happen. Count on me. Yes, see you real soon. You had good sense talking about school. Be careful. Hold tight. See this light? We could catch crayfish with it. - I'd be surprised. - Wanna bet? What are you doing here? Henriette, I'll put them inside and come back to pay you. In Paris are big traffic-jams, caused by the strike of government personnel. No transportation for one hour. How are you, Henriette? Thank you, Mr. Charles. Say, isn't your husband here? The Mayor is at City Hall. At this hour? I'm going to see what he's up to. - I need to talk. - Is there a problem? A big problem. Huge even. You don't build a school at the motorway. That's dangerous. If we change the place, the Ministry refuses the grant. We don't care about the ministry. It's for us to decide. They never listen. Why did we conduct two wars? The safety of our children comes first. That's a good one! You don't even send your kids to school. School is compulsory. Not school, but education. Shit! I raise my children as I please. When yours finish primary school, mine are qualified Greek teachers. We work, we're not lazy. I want to send the two youngest to your new school. If it's built on the plateau. Not on the motorway. Okay, mayor? Are you sending your children to public school? Did the Lord play a trick on you? If you weren't a soldier like me with a sore leg, - your left, my right... - Of course. We think differently. Listen to me and don't talk nonsense. You might wind up antagonizing the entire village. You can forget being elected. I will not support you. You, Charles Bertoux, Gaullist, Catholic and so on, will you vote for a radical socialist? Against whom? Against your brother-in-law? Do you take me for a greenhorn? Benoît isn't against you. Who else? You? You always said that... You'll learn that I'm not shy of one more contradiction. Okay, I've said my piece. Your move, cripple. Mr. Bertoux. - Father, can I see you a moment? - Of course. And hop! That's one. Hop! Another one. It's small. Watch your toes.. It's full of broken glass. Ah, this is a nice one. I'm freezing. My God, it is cold! - Hop! - Get out, you'll catch a cold. A dozen more. - Who's there? - Shit, the constable! Who's there? ♪ The constable blows a fart ♪ he takes his ass for a trumpet ♪ and his prick for a lollipop ♪ Soldier, rise up ♪ Soldier, rise up quickly ♪ Soldier, rise up ♪ Soldier, rise up quickly Marc is not well at all. Almost 41. - We should call the doctor. - No. Champagne. - What? - Sparkling. Recipe from the army. We used it at Verdun. Or else a mustard plaster. I prefer sparkling wine over mustard. Okay, wine served by the ladies, while the men go to mass. To summarize today's Gospel in a nutshell, I remind you that Jesus came so that his lambs, the Christians, might have life in abundance. I can only welcome... all efforts made to rebuild our country. Beloved brethren, I don't want... to finish this sermon... without saying something about the location... of the future school. It is not up to me... to interfere in the affairs of the secular republic... and public schools. But I must warn you. It's about your children's safety. The location is badly chosen. The motorway, with speeding cars, is dangerous for our children. I wanted to warn you. Hello, Fernand. - Hello. - How are you doing, Fernand? Does Armand have a lie-in? - He's sick. - The doctor visited. Oh, poor old man. It looks like Benoît... has swallowed his missal. The sermon about the school: It has already been signed. - I know what you're doing. - Fuck you. Why do you hide that you want to be mayor? Just to annoy you. - See you soon. - Goodbye. See you later. - Well, Charles? - Are you okay? Are you running for mayor? - That would be nice. - And Fernand, you're not? I am. But communists won't win here. While De Gaulle's party, the RPF, wins big. If you're running we'll vote for you. - Yes. - That's for sure. Armand is a good mayor. Aren't you Gaullist? Gaullist from London. There's a difference. I don't like to compromise. I would rather remain outside... and oversee those that are elected. - Dad! - What is it? It's Marc. He stopped talking. It seems he's not pulling through. - Immediately to the hospital. - Hospital? I fear for pneumonia, Mrs. Bertoux. Maybe worse. My goodness. My car is faster than the ambulance. Rather mine, it's more reliable. You and your army recipe. - Mr. Bertoux. - Yes, Doctor? Your boys have red eyes. Pepper. Protect them. They need eyes to read and write. What counts are deeds, not words. Anything else, Doctor? Armand. - Is he at death's door? - No. He wants to meet you, but without witnesses. Tonight. No problem, I'm expecting him. - Yeah, but he with his leg... - And I with mine? He asks for it, so he has to move. I came to come to an agreement. Not for endless debate. - Are you threatening me? - You wanted to see me. Yes, it's about the school. I want guarantees. Guarantees? You say you'll vote for me, but I hear it's a trick. With us a promise is sacred. Oh, don't get angry, Charles! Excuse me. I want to believe you, but we are not on the... same political side. So your proposal, you understand... is hard to believe. - Then there's your brother-in-law. - There we are: The brother-in-law. He says your opposition to the school is a pretext. And you believe him? What do you have against each other? Family problems are not put out on parade. In the eyes of my in-laws, the Chouquets, I wasn't good enough for their daughter. And besides disabled. Cécile loved me and gave them the finger. They almost didn't come to the wedding. And Benoît is the king of pretend, the emperor of suckers. He got fortune on the black market and not to mention Petain. Since the liberation, contact has been cut, with me at least. His workers do like me. They ask my advice. He doesn't like that, I tell you. Okay. About the school, it's okay. But I count on you for the rest. Don't start with your doubts. Come, give me five. You'll announce it. Okay? I always say that life's a big party. Eh, old stump? Look, Sophie, he's coming for me. He's cute, that walking stick. Walking stick? It's like a leaf. A living leaf. Jean, turn off the light. Marc has a pleurisy. He'll be in hospital for a month. A month in the hospital. How are we going to pay for that? The surgeon is doing it for three chickens. And the hospital settles for 20 cubic meters of wood. Scams. Again scams. I've had enough of all of this, Charles. It's nice to want to be self-employed, not depend on anyone, be your own boss, not being bossed around. But look where it leads. We're only living in anguish. You're exaggerating, right? Of course, you're tired. But Marc will be alright. - Isn't that all that matters? - Yes. Our life doesn't seem ideal for our kids, you know? When they grow up they should feel good about themselves, not outcasts. Listen, Charles, I gave up everything for you. My family which you upset, the Art Academy, most of my friends, even Charlotte, my best friend. I was dreaming, yes, of a rural life with many children. That's true. But not this mayhem and continuous insecurity. Promise that our children can go to school, like their peers. To school, huh? To school. As if they're not fine here at the school of freedom. My whole life I learned on the job. From experience, on my own. That's the best school. All my life I've lived in freedom. And I want the same for my boys. Your boys. And your girls? - And me? - Who loves me, follows me. ♪ Ledoux chicory ♪ Ledoux chicory, happiness in our home ♪ Ledoux chicory, health at breakfast ♪ Soldier, rise up ♪ Soldier, rise up quickly ♪ Soldier, rise up ♪ Soldier, rise up quickly Rise and shine, there's work to be done. Sophie, your napkin. How long till the baby is there, Mom? - About ten weeks. - Waiting for another ten weeks. - Hurry up, I'm hungry. - I'm hungry. - Good morning, Mom. - Good morning. Dad isn't here? He went to pick it up Marc from the hospital. Could you keep it down! Go wash your hands. Okay, Gaëtan. It's very brave to go after the little ones. He's disgusting! Beat it, that's my place. - Étienne! 100 times. - 100 times what? "I mustn't slap." That's unfair. Guys, you forgot to pray this morning. I'm not sure if the Lord can hear you. Bless us, O Lord, bless this meal, those that have prepared this... and give bread to those who have not. Amen. There's Daddy. It was so boring. A month of hell with those nurses. He was scolding them so much that they were glad he left. Ah, my man, you know that life is one big party. Careful. Yes, Bertoux speaking. Hello, Armand. Yes, I'm listening. They gave in? You see, to resist, say no, holler, it's the only way to go. Otherwise, the bureaucrats walk over us and starve us. Right. So you announce it? You did? Bravo, Armand. Greetings, soldier of World War I. Won. We won! The school will be built on the plateau. Someone will be sulking. - Who will be sulking? - But Marc! Benoît Chouquet, for example. - Bravo. - The mayor told the people. You support him. You're helping a bastard. You're betraying your village. What's in your head? Convictions. You'll hear from me. Are you supporting Armand? What should I do? Run myself? Who will put food on the table? Men, to the factory today. Except Marc. Thanks, Dad. You want to talk to me? When your mother does the laundry, you are going to get wood. - You promised Mom. - Mom is my concern. Go, son. Quietly without a sound. Grease the wheels. At your orders, Sergeant! - Mommy? - Yes, sweetheart? For some time you and Dad are fighting all the time. All the time? You're exaggerating. His leg hurts a lot. And life's not easy right now. We're struggling to make ends meet. But your father is counting on the pepper to pull us through. Don't worry. It's fine. So you still love each other? Of course we still love each other. Like on the first day. Is that why you got so many children? Not everyone can have children. Look at Uncle Benoît. I want children, but not that many. Three would be nice. There were salt mines in 1700. Trenches between 1914-1918. Concentration camps between 1939-1945. And Daddy invented pepper granaries in 1947. - What a life! - A big party, my man. Bravo, that clears the passages. How are you doing? That's not too bad. Get the hang of it and you can pick up the pace. - Isn't it enough? - There's only two of you. Dad! Pierre was arrested by the police. Hell's bloody bells! The war is over. Militia didn't arrest the father, police will not arrest the son. Mr. Charles, your son is too young to drive, and furthermore... Furthermore what? Your business is not legal. It is unfair competition. For who? If my brother-in-law sends you, go ahead. Write me up. Slap the shackles on me. Arrest the warrior of Verdun. Your son isn't allowed to drive. - It's the law. - The law. I'm very disappointed. I thought you were more responsible. You promised not to drive. Do you want him go to jail? No "buts". You wouldn't do it anymore. - A glass of Quinquina wine? - Don't mind if we do. There's no more Quinquina wine. - What do we eat? - Sausages, as usual. Jean, you're disgusting. Look at your hands. Go wash. Beware if you're gonna see Mom. - A fury. What's wrong with her? - I know. - You're getting on my nerves. - What is it, darling? - You know what I mean. - Don't worry about the truck. It's all been arranged. You made a promise and you didn't keep it. Much ado about nothing. It won't happen again. It won't happen again. This whole thing is a setup. Why? Benoît can't stand I transport timber. He's sick. You're sick, my poor Charles. Stop thinking that Benoît is responsible for all your misfortune. The problem here is Pierre. He won't have his driver's license for another 4 years and you can't drive. Sell the truck and find something else to do. The truck in which I liberated the village? Never. Never? None of us will ever drive the truck. We agreed that they were going to school. They will go. Really. I'll deal with this. I'll borrow some money. I'll put food on the table. You won't lack a thing. Get out of my kitchen. Hop. You look like shit, Fernand. What is it? You got no right to quit. Run for office. - You should. - Don't let Armand be elected. - Or your brother-in-law. - He's an RPF candidate. I told you. I'll fight when France is in danger. Because of Communists, for example. We are patriots, we have proven that. Come, I don't want to quarrel with you. - You like to help others. - No need to be mayor for that. We don't want to see Benoît at city hall. - Because if we go on strike... - Are you going on strike? We don't want to die at work. - Do you know how much we earn? - That is typical Chouquet. That has to change. But you shouldn't mix things up. We didn't fight in 1914 and 1940... to get cheated by some fortune tellers. Don't let striking blind you. Chouquet's factory is the only one. We're not yet on strike. Dad. Dad. Come to mama. Grandpa Chouquet is dead. Why is grandpa dead, mom? Because God called him home. What's he doing with him? He too old to be of use. (In Latin) Speak French. Remember man that thou art dust... and ye shall return to dust. Enough, you guys. Tonight you'll pray for his soul to rest in peace. Rather tell us about the war of 1914. Yes, the Chemin des Dames. April 1917, one of the most absurd moments... in French history. His whole staff was against, but General Nivelle decided... to attack the enemy at an impregnable location. Nivelle was so sure of himself, the imbecile, that in one month 200,000 soldiers died. And twice as many wounded. A real bloodbath. - Am I telling or you? - You. Do you think now's the time to tell this? Mom, it's been a long time since he told it. We're going to forget our history. We already losers at math. You can do it! 323 BC? Death of the conqueror of Persia. 66 AD? Fall of the Roman Empire. 67 BC? - Defeat of Vercingetorix. - 1068, 1st crusade. 1214, victory Bouvines. 1346, defeat of Crecy. 1415, defeat of Agincourt. 1429, Joan of Arc rescued Orleans. 1492, Columbus discovered America. - 1515... - Victory of Marignan. In 1572, St. Bartholomew Massacre. 1610, assassination of Henri IV. No one asked you, butt-hole. And what happened in 1648, my little girl? Kings and queens, princesses and princes... gathered around a table and signed the treaty of Westphalia. And France won the Alsace. Just like winning a sweet at the three cup game. What happened in 1947 AD? The death of grandfather Chouquet. Go, go to bed. Come on. Lord, who's forgiving and merciful, We humbly pray to you for the soul of your deceased servant. You called him to you, save him from hell. Don't forget the ones close to you. - Who was that? - I wasn't me, Marie. - You don't know how to fart. - Yes, I do.. Ah, Sophie! Who farted before? - It wasn't me. Smell. - Me neither. Ah, you bunch of perverts. Let's try it again. May your angels show him the way, so that after believing and hoping for you... he's not in danger... - Luc. - It's him. It's not me, it's Chouquets soul finding no rest. "The woodworking factory Chouquet & Fils, "currently managed by my son Benoît, "doing this very efficiently, "and to whom I bequeath the whole company with all its assets. "Lastly, to my daughter Cécile I bequeath... "1000 shares of the Water Company, worth 60,000 francs, "and the property Beaumont, where she's living. "Done at Paris on April 1, 1947. "Healthy of mind and body. Signed: Edmond Chouquet". April Fool's Day. I didn't know my father was that facetious. - Excuse me, ma'am? - Yes, notary. It's probably an April 1 joke. The Testament mentions the ruins... where I live, but doesn't mention the most important assets: The family-owned 1000 acres forest, the quarries, the meadows... I'll explain, Cécile, but not here. What!? Why not here? Where else but at the notary do we talk about inheritance? Cécile, come on. Answer me, notary. What happened to this property? Tell her. Ms. Bertoux these properties are not in the will... because they are sold. Sold? To whom? Sold to your brother, Mr. Benoît Chouquet, present here. Sold to my brother? Is that a joke? When? Over a year ago. Well... Mama, Benoît, say something. It can't be true, or else it's a scam. Have you disowned me, is that it? We'll explain, Cécile, but not here. Thank you. Why eat your heart out about the inheritance? Why? Because I've been robbed. They have robbed me, it's that simple. But I want to fight and I will fight. Fight for us, for your children, not for trivial things. Trivial things... We could have gotten out of this mess with it. With it I could have sent all your sons to college. I promised you that everything will be arranged. Pierre, Gaëtan, Marc and Etienne go there in September. Oh yeah? With what money? And Jean? And Marie? And Sophie? You don't only have boys. You also have girls. Yes. And a very beautiful woman. Now you know how your family is, you're all mine. Let's celebrate this new woman. What's going on? - What is it? - Marc went starkers. What an idea! Go rinse yourself. That shit is burning. What's happening? Marc thought he was a steak. Give him a towel. Hello, Mr. Bertoux. Where are you with your pepper shakers? Nowhere. I need a German machine. Germany, that's far. Because I can't sell your bags anymore. The competition offers pepper shakers. - But I'm cheaper. - Yes, but the missus... wants ease of use. The missus? Give me a holler when you're equipped. Goodbye. Go back to work. Why? Slaving for pepper that's not selling. - He's tight. - School, no pepper. Get to work, damn it! To school, damn it! I go to work. Life is one big party. - The pepper doesn't sell. - We're slaving for nothing. Always chores, never lessons. Always being yelled at. - He's only thinking about the election. - To hell with the election and pepper. I'll stop doing homework. Why aren't we going to school? The boys are right. And you're arguing more and more. We're bloody sick of it. - Marc! - Excuse me, I wanted to say sick of it. - Calm down. I keep nagging him about school. I'll get there. Then we are all old. Please do something, Mom. Please, Mommy. Charles, I just had a conversation with your sons. Tell me. Explain to them why the pepper doesn't work out. They believe that it's useless. They believe that? Kids believe these days? They want to go to school. Why not order me? I'm getting bored of your kids. In fact I'm getting bored with all of you. What do you mean, we're all boring you? Am I boring you? Very good. - What is happening here? - Nothing. - I'm packing my suitcase, that's all. - Your suitcase? - Where are you going? - I'm going. Enough is enough. I'm sick of it. You drive us all up the wall.. You break promises. You denounce war and generals, but you act like a commander. - You are a slave driver to your children. - Me? Don't interrupt me, please. The truth is that your hatred for Benoît makes you betray your beliefs. And that disappoints me the most. Honestly, you don't resemble the man that I married. I need air, clear my mind, reflection and rest. My child is due in a month. But in what condition? Your men never missed out on anything. We've always managed. - And God... - God. God has a straight back. I find him rather indifferent to us. Did God ask us to have so many children? The Virgin Mary only got one. It didn't frustrate her. You agreed. We wanted the children. We wanted many. I'm not listening any more. I'm going and that's it. Clear? Where are you going? Are you planning to stay away long? You'll find out. - You never did this before. - Don't insist, please. It's no use. I'm dead set. Really determined. Let me through. Go work on the election, else it goes wrong. - Mom, we will miss you. - But I'll be back. Promised. - We're going to miss you. - Dear Mom. - Will you come back? - You asked me to act. So I come into action. - Are you going to Grandma? - Certainly not. Are you going to Charlotte? I have to leave so that he understands. I have to hurry. We're not doing anything anymore. He's not even taking us to mass. Today we're in for it. It is the day of the election. I don't care. I can learn Latin. Gaëtan, breakfast is ready. Go get them. Is there something wrong? It smells like shit. It smells like roses, Jean. The toilet is clogged. It's true, it stinks. The septic tank must be full. It needs to be emptied. - Shall I call the septic guy? - Who? - We do it ourselves. It's nothing. - Nothing? Shit? But that's disgusting. No, you'll see. After breakfast we'll start under Jean's command. - Good fertilizer for the garden. - The garden? We'll be poisoned. - It's really nasty. - Of course not. It is called septic tank because the microbes... convert the faeces, our excrement, into odorless, clean minerals. That clears the passages, huh? Go on, get to work! Come, make a chain. Shit. Don't spill too much. A second bucket of shit. Not too much at once. A third bucket of shit. Good. Fourth bucket of shit. Girls, on the right side of the garden. One bucket per path. Little soldiers. Don't spill. It is worth gold. Daddy, help! I "fallen" in the shit! I "fallen" in. I'm dying. I "fallen" in. I fell in, not "fallen". - It's not funny, I'm going to die! - Of course not. It is healthy and good for the skin. It's enlightening, sitting in shit. It's a very good experience. Hey, my soldier? Life is one big party. ♪ Jean fell in the shit ♪ He was just like a piece of chocolate I will now stink for my whole life. No, I smell nothing. And with some cologne you'll smell like a perfume factory. I'm fed up, Dad. Always doing chores, I want to go to boarding school. Boarding school is no paradise. - But I want to go. - We also want to go. I also want to go. Your turn will come, little one. And your turn too. Come on. Do I have to come up? - My car is broken. - The bells are ringing. Don't you know what day it is? This is not good, huh? No. It's because Cécile left. I lost city hall. What matters is our promise. Our covenant seemed unnatural. You and I thumbed our nose... at the rest. We couldn't do better. As veterans. Yes, but for your brother-in-law it's a triumph. Factory boss and mayor, he's a big shot. You better watch out. Cheers, soldier. It's time to pray, Daddy. Don't lose courage for something so small. You tell us often enough. Dad? Will you tell us about your fight against the Krauts? Come on, Mom's not here. - Tell us about when you got hurt. - Just once. - July 11, 1917. - Please, Dad. Come on. Come on, please. Come on, please. On that day... the Krauts attacked from the left. We were almost trapped. "Over here", I shout. "Fire!" The machine guns come into action. A few rifles. The others, nothing. I climb up the parapet. And then, "Fire!, damn it!" Everybody gets it. They all climb on the parapet with me. Everybody's shooting. "Fire!" The guns burned our hands. The enemy was riddled. We had many... dead, wounded everywhere. It was horrible, stupid, but we had to. "Fire!" And after that, Daddy? Then you advanced with your men. The Krauts retreated. Then you were nailed by shellfire. You were injured on your belly and leg. A mate carried you. You shouted at him to leave you behind to die. Your mate deserted you and you passed out. I woke up in a German hospital. - Did it hurt? - A little, yes. The boy who carried me wrote my mother... that I was dead. - We are children of a dead man. - Yes, in a way. Till the day I met your mother. She really gave me back my life. How did you meet Mom? I know. Dad sat on the the road side, Mother was very small. She walked across the bridge. She turned around, and she stayed, as dad wanted. And she got a lot of children. That's exactly what happened. Hello, I'd like number 74 in Saint - Léonard, please. Thank you. Charlotte? Good evening. Can I talk to Mom? Thank you. Mama? Dad has lost the election. He's not doing good, He has no taste for anything. And neither do I. Yes, I look after him and everyone else. You have to come back to look after him. After him and after us. Yes, Mom. Of course, Mom. My dear mother. Oh, mama. Take care. We count on him and on you. Yes, Mom. Goodnight. Hurry up repairing that car. That's it. The animals are fed, the fields are done. The shop is running. I can take care of you now. That leaves the injection. Can I? If you like. Good! A real nurse. - You're joking. - No, it was perfect. Thank you. When I grow up, I want to become a nurse. Cure people, relieve pain. Don't you want to become a nun? No, medical nurse. With a Red Cross diploma. Like on the radio in "New professions". I'll be a great nurse. I'll give you my salary, so you'll have no worries. - Have you been thinking about this for long? - Yes. You never told me. I'm not harassing you like the boys. I'm your daughter, dad. Nationwide program. Morning News September 17, 1947. You're becoming a nurse. The Roman Church has taken severe measures against... the communist doctrine: The Pope excludes the Communists. There are days I'd like to kick the papists down the toilet. What jackasses. This pope did not exclude the fascists, and he excludes the communists! What rubbish! The Church would be wiser to address the plight of the people. You know what I want you to do? Throw all this religious crap in the attic. - Don't you love God? - God, yes. We don't need images from Rome to love God. Get going. Mama was right. What a hothead! Look, miss. My sons are good in French and Latin, but bad at math. Can you give them private lessons? On Thursday or Sunday, when I'm not working. All right. Suzanne! Bring the kids inside. Have them do the multiplication tables. - I'll be right there. - Yes. Are eggs and ducks enough for payment? Ducks? If you want. I love ducks. If I can give you some advice: They should be sent to school. That's the goal. They have to be on the proper level. I understand, but for school ducks are not enough, Mr. Bertoux. The world is changing dramatically. And that will not stop. You're raising them like Robinson Crusoe. - Oh well... - Well, in your way. Look. This is the future that awaits them. Chickens that lay Chickens that pay Take them. Yes. Thank you, miss. Why did you sell the car? Don't get too attached to useless things. - How do we haul the wood? - No more wood. No more pepper. Chickens. In America... they breed battery hens, like an assembly-line for cars. Everyone eats chicken whenever he wants. The modern era is the age of the chicken. We'll do as the Americans. At the beginning of the new school year, Pierre and Gaëtan will go to boarding school. - When? - And we? Once everything is installed. It consists of two parts. One for hatching and one for breeding. In the first one are 500 fertilized eggs. In the second one 50 one week old chicks. And we shall see who survives. Lunch! Why wouldn't they survive? Because they're not hatched by their mom but by machine. They can easily catch deadly diseases. Deadly? Diphtheria, common cold, botulism, leukemia, coccidiosis, the pip. - And much more. - Lunch! What are we doing with them? We'll sell them in the market. To schools, and maybe the military. For the meantime, We have to work hard. - Lunch! - We’ll work in shifts. - Take turns. - Oh, no. Day and night. Lunch, damn it! What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? I'm screaming and nobody listens. Come on! Lunch! Come on. Gaëtan, don't dawdle. What is this grub? This grub is your daughter's chore. Your daughter is slowly getting fed up with it. Nobody is helping me and you are insulting me. I wasn't insulting, I made a joke. Why are you all upset? Mommy is leaving us because of you and you're asking this? We may have a new brother. Why don't you go get her? You don't care that mom is gone, but we are fed up. Do you understand? I do care. Sure, I do care. Well then... Well then... Well then? She's at Charlotte. Sit down. Sophie, sit down. Come on. Unbelievable. - She'll receive you in one minute. - One minute? You managed without her this long. You'll manage one minute longer. What is it with the two of you? The model couple, the symbol of conjugal love. - Did you lose your way? - No idea, Charlotte. Say rather what you think. I don't think I have the answer. Me, wife of a lawyer, rich, no kids, no job. Charles, you may come in. And this is Mathieu. Oh, Mathieu, my beautiful Mathieu! Welcome to the Bertoux family, cutie. Welcome. You arrive at the moment that we enter the modern era. The era of the chicken, my chicken. The chicken age. Dad Charles' chicken. Hey, my chicken. What are you talking about? He only just arrived. That's true. I didn't tell your mother. We haven't told her yet. Shall we tell her? Honey, when you were gone, Mathieu and I have... abandoned the pepper and opted for chicken. Battery cages the American way. Can you imagine? Yes. Eh no. You exchanged the pepper for chicken, is that it? I exchanged the pepper for chicken. I only need the incubator to start the operation. - An incubator for chicken? - I haven't yet the money, but you'll see, it'll be great. I'll explain how to raise chicken. No, please. Don't tell me about your new enterprises. - I've got my hands full with mine. - Yours? Yes, mine. I'm legally challenging my father's will, and the sales to Benoît. Charlotte's husband is a lawyer and is confident that I can win. That sale was done on purpose so that I would not inherit. A lawsuit, that's just more trouble. Yes, maybe. But it's my trouble. Come on, let's go home. No, Charles. I only come home on my conditions. There's one hair on Mathieus head, and there's one tooth. There's one tooth, there's one hair on Mathieus head. There is only one tooth in Jean's mouth. How did you know his name? Easy-peasy: The only evangelist still missing. - Can I hold him? - Not now. Bring the luggage upstairs. Another soldier there. Look at your brother. - What a big nose. - He's super cute. But he has a big nose. Children, your mother is calling you. Thanks, Mom. The book I was missing. A baby. Have you seen the knife? Really super. Once I'll get a real one. Children! With the arrival of Mathieu... the Bertoux family will change its life. Why? Jean, Luc and Sophie will go to the new municipal school, as soon as it's open. Pierre, Étienne, Marc, Gaëtan and Marie... go to boarding school. This time I'm the one who says it. - Until then... - No chores. No. No! But study is a priority. Your mother will make the work plan. Pierre and Marc, get the basket... from the bottom of the cabinet. And this is the gift for your father. For your incubator. Isn't the silverware for a rainy day? It is a rainy day, honey. Why does it take two? On your own you'd need an hour to turn them. Damn! Getting up three times per night. - Worse than the trenches. - Long live school. Marc, come look! Quick! - They're cute. - They are tiny. - They're like little balls. - It's working. It's working. Yes, it's working! - It's working! - Wake up, everybody! - There are chicks! - Come on! Dad, it's working! - Quick, wake up! - Wake up! Come on! They are so sweet. Look. - Look how funny he is. - He's flying. Mine has a nightmare. Look. Look, Mathieu. Well, men, life is one big party. - You're looking for war. - What does this mean? You come to my home to yell at me? And for a kick in the pants? Hold on. Fernand said you were pushing him to strike. Really! Poor guy. If I wanted, your factory could already be shut down. I order you to stop this action. You order me? Joker. That's funny, man. Go home and screw you. I won't forget this, just see. Communist. You are lucky, sister. Did you advise Fernand to go on strike? I didn't tell him so, but didn't discourage him either. When things turn sour, you'll need to restore peace. Yes, I see. - How many dead tonight? - Two, Sergeant. Bravo. The fewer deaths, the better for business. - When do we do business? - When we're selling. But in order to sell them, you have to kill them. In about 3 weeks we'll have a party. A party? A razor sharp blade. A hollow upper part adapts to the skull of the animal. I bring the instrument in the open mouth of the animal, and with a fast, controlled motion I'll kill without suffering. Thus we kill the chickens, by cutting their throat... with this special knife. Then... Pierre and Gaëtan... dip them in a bowl with boiling water, so we can pluck them. But you'll cook them. Not in those few seconds to soften the feather. Then Jean Marc and Étienne bleed them. And, finally, mom and Marie adorn them. What does that mean, dress them? That means we make them look nice, to make them tasty to eat. Like the Americans we'll do the work at the assembly line. It's called the Taylor system. Got it, men? Doesn't using the knife make it a bit like a slaughterhouse? What do you suggest? This way it goes faster... and it's cleaner, right? Lord, bless this meal, those that have prepared this... and for the chickens reared by the Bertoux family. And give your blessing to the success of this enterprise. These chickens have no table manners. Delicious. Really tender. It's weird, they smell like fish. A bit soft. I wonder if the boiling water... Don't talk nonsense. No need to fuck around with the bones, they're already loose. Jean, leave the table and write 100 times: "I don't need to bother with the bones." May I ask for mercy for today? I can't refuse that. But he will do his duty. These chickens are really revolting. Pastor blessed them, so God will find them delicious. So people should find them delicious. If only we sell them, isn't that so, Father? Business has nothing to do with God, my child. Since we're talking about God, it seems that crucifixes are no longer welcome here? Christ is in penance, because his buddies in Rome are behaving like jackasses. Hey, a reborn. You're here for the pastor? Or you came to taste my chicken? Hi, everyone. Enjoy your meal. Benoît's workers go on strike. So what? Hi, Cécile. It's bad for the village. The village has elected Benoît Chouquet. Let him take care of his constituents. It's not our problem. On the contrary, Charles. We lost a battle, not the war. You know what I'm saying? I know. What are you planning? - Charles, you can't... - Oh, I can. It is my duty. Your brother's workers are the guys in our outfit. They were there for us. He exploits them. He is a caricature of a boss. We have to help them. I'm listening. Go ahead. Go get the dessert. If the village supports the strike, it's a matter of a few days. You can get everybody together. Without you I won't get the support of the entire village. I support you. Greetings, soldier of World War I. Goodbye, Cécile. - Charles. - What? Your brother is screwing us since we were married. You seem pretty lenient with him. - The leniency might be calculated. - What do you mean? You know I want to fight. I don't have a big heart like you. I'm a lioness who must nurture and defend her little ones. Thanks for the picture. And what am I? - Am I some lion shit? - Mister Charles. Excuse me, Father. - Well, those communists. - You're not going to start again? Bring them to reason. Oh no. And I ask you to not interfere. God doesn't ask to break strikes. Rather organize a soup kitchen for the strikers. - A soup kitchen? With what? - I'll give you the vegetables. And chicken. Excuse me. Hello? Charlotte! Yes, it's going very good. It's like 1914 again. He organizes and stops strikes. He launched into the chicken business. Yes. He never changes. Yes, give me your husband. Good evening, counselor. So what's the news? It is sold at the market price? My father must have secretly given him money, so that Benoît could do things properly. No, I have of course no evidence. So I can't get anything back? Yes, I have only my eyes for crying. Don't apologize, it's not your fault. Thanks, Paul. Goodbye. Okay. See you soon, Father. - What's going on? - Nothing. Your frame is still as hard, dear Charles. You hurt me. What's wrong with you? Nothing, I'm happy. Life is one big party, my man. Dad! There was a bombing! Thousands of deaths! - Poor chicks. - It's awful. - They're bleeding. - It is coccidiosis. Hell's bloody bells! Everything is lost. It is like the Chemin des Dames. This is the "Chemin des Poulets". Over, it's over. I'm finished. Nothing is finished, dear Charles. I'm good for nothing. Everything I undertake collapses. I'm the king of collapse. Don't talk nonsense. Have you lost? I also lost to my brother. I'll get nothing back from the inheritance. That was the call from earlier. We're even. And we both start at zero again. - Yes, at zero. That's the word. - Listen, Charles, We don't have much, but we have enough... for you to start a meaningful business. Stop being such a big baby. I'll help you. If you want. You want me to come back in line? Do you have a choice? The age of the chicken, modern times as you say, is no longer the time of all freedoms. Another life awaits our children. We have to prepare them for it. Anyway... We've got nothing to be sorry for. We've made the best of it. Subtitles by Subransu Edited by Grushki
